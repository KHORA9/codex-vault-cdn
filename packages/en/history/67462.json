S. Graves, _The Court and the London\r\n   Theatres_ (1913), is perhaps the most valuable for the subject\r\n   of the present chapter, which was mainly written before it\r\n   reached me. A general account of the Italian drama of the\r\n   Renaissance is in W. Creizenach, _Geschichte des neueren\r\n   Dramas_, vol. ii (1901). Full details for Ferrara and Mantua\r\n   are given by A. D’Ancona, _Origini del Teatro Italiano_\r\n   (1891), of which App. II is a special study of _Il Teatro\r\n   Mantovano nel secolo xvi_. F. Neri, _La Tragedia italiana del\r\n   Cinquecento_ (1904), E. Gardner, _Dukes and Poets at Ferrara_\r\n   (1904), and _The King of Court Poets_ (1906), W. Smith, _The\r\n   Commedia dell’ Arte_ (1912), are also useful. Special works\r\n   on staging are E. Flechsig, _Die Dekorationen der modernen\r\n   Bühne in Italien_ (1894), and G. Ferrari, _La Scenografia_\r\n   (1902). The Terence engravings are described by M. Herrmann,\r\n   _Forschungen zur deutschen Theatergeschichte des Mittelalters\r\n   und der Renaissance_ (1914). Of contemporary Italian treatises,\r\n   the unprinted _Spectacula_ of Pellegrino Prisciano is in\r\n   _Cod. Est. lat._ d. x. 1, 6 (cf. G. Bertoni, _La Biblioteca\r\n   Estense_, 13), and of L. de Sommi’s _Dialoghi in materia di\r\n   rappresentazione scenica_ (c. 1565) a part only is in L.\r\n   Rasi, _I Comici italiani_ (1897), i. 107. The first complete\r\n   edition of S. Serlio, _Architettura_ (1551), contains Bk. ii,\r\n   on _Perspettiva_; the English translation was published by\r\n   R. Peake (1611); extracts are in App. G; a biography is L.\r\n   Charvet, _Sébastien Serlio_ (1869). Later are L. Sirigatti, _La\r\n   pratica di prospettiva_ (1596), A. Ingegneri, _Della poesia\r\n   rappresentativa e del modo di rappresentare le favole sceniche_\r\n   (1598), and N.

Laurent_ in _Mémoires de la Soc. de l’Hist. de Paris et\r\n   de l’Ile-de-France_, xxviii (1901), 105. An edition by H. C.\r\n   Lancaster (1920) adds Mahelot’s designs.]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the problems, reserved from treatment in the foregoing\r\nchapter, of scenic background. What sort of setting did the types\r\nof theatre described afford for the plots, often complicated, and\r\nthe range of incident, so extraordinarily wide, which we find in\r\nElizabethan drama? No subject in literary history has been more often\r\nor more minutely discussed, during the quarter of a century since the\r\nSwan drawing was discovered, and much valuable spadework has been done,\r\nnot merely in the collecting and marshalling of external evidence,\r\nbut also in the interpretation of this in the light of an analysis of\r\nthe action of plays and of the stage-directions by which these are\r\naccompanied.[1] Some points have emerged clearly enough; and if on\r\nothers there is still room for controversy, this may be partly due to\r\nthe fact that external and internal evidence, when put together, have\r\nproved inadequate, and partly also to certain defects of method into\r\nwhich some of the researchers have fallen. To start from the assumption\r\nof a ‘typical Shakespearian stage’ is not perhaps the best way of\r\napproaching an investigation which covers the practices of thirty or\r\nforty playing companies, in a score of theatres, over a period of not\r\nmuch less than a century. It is true that, in view of the constant\r\nshifting of companies and their plays from one theatre to another, some\r\n‘standardization of effects’, in Mr. Archer’s phrase, may at any one\r\ndate be taken for granted.[2] But analogous effects can be produced\r\nby very different arrangements, and even apart from the obvious\r\nprobability that the structural divergences between public and private\r\ntheatres led to corresponding divergences in the systems of setting\r\nadopted, it is hardly safe to neglect the possibility of a considerable\r\nevolution in the capacities of stage-management between 1558 and 1642,\r\nor even between 1576 and 1616. At any rate a historical treatment\r\nwill be well advised to follow the historical method. The scope of\r\nthe inquiry, moreover, must be wide enough to cover performances at\r\nCourt, as well as those on the regular stage, since the plays used for\r\nboth purposes were undoubtedly the same. Nor can Elizabethan Court\r\nperformances, in their turn, be properly considered, except in the\r\nperspective afforded by a short preliminary survey of the earlier\r\ndevelopments of the art of scenic representation at other Renaissance\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with the study of Vitruvius in the latter part of\r\nthe fifteenth century by the architect Alberti and others, which led\r\nscholars to realize that the tragedies of the pseudo-Seneca and the\r\ncomedies of Terence and the recently discovered Plautus had been\r\nnot merely recited, but acted much in the fashion already familiar\r\nin contemporary _ludi_ of the miracle-play type.[3] The next step\r\nwas, naturally, to act them, in the original or in translations.\r\nAlberti planned a _theatrum_ in the Vatican for Nicholas V, but the\r\nthree immediate successors of Nicholas were not humanists, and it\r\nis not until the papacy of Innocent VIII that we hear of classical\r\nperformances at Rome by the pupils of Pomponius Laetus. One of these\r\nwas Tommaso Inghirami, who became a cardinal, without escaping the\r\nnickname of Phaedra from the part he had played in _Hippolytus_. This,\r\nas well as at least one comedy, had already been given before the\r\npublication (_c._ 1484–92) of an edition of Vitruvius by Sulpicius\r\nVerulanus, with an epistle addressed by the editor to Cardinal\r\nRaffaelle Riario, as a notable patron of the revived art. Sulpicius is\r\nallusive rather than descriptive, but we hear of a fair adorned stage,\r\n5 ft. high, for the tragedy in the forum, of a second performance in\r\nthe Castle of St. Angelo, and a third in Riario’s house, where the\r\naudience sat under _umbracula_, and of the ‘picturatae scenae facies’,\r\nwhich the cardinal provided for a comedy by the Pomponiani.[4]\r\nPerformances continued after the death of Pomponius in 1597, but we\r\nget no more scenic details, and when the _Menaechmi_ was given at the\r\nwedding of Alfonso d’Este and Lucrezia Borgia in 1502 it is noted that\r\n‘non gli era scena alcuna, perchè la camera non era capace’.[5] It\r\nis not until 1513 that we get anything like a description of a Roman\r\nneo-classical stage, at the conferment of Roman citizenship on Giuliano\r\nand Lorenzo de’ Medici, the Florentine kinsmen of Leo X.[6] This had a\r\ndecorated back wall divided by pilasters into five spaces, in each of\r\nwhich was a door covered by a curtain of golden stuff. There were also\r\ntwo side-doors, for entrance and exit, marked ‘via ad forum’.\r\n\r\nAn even more important centre of humanistic drama than Rome was\r\nFerrara, where the poets and artists, who gathered round Duke Ercole\r\nI of Este, established a tradition which spread to the allied courts\r\nof the Gonzagas at Mantua and the Delle Rovere at Urbino. The first\r\nneo-classical revival on record at Ferrara was of the _Menaechmi_\r\nin 1486, from which we learn that Epidamnus was represented by five\r\nmarvellous ‘case’ each with its door and window, and that a practicable\r\nboat moved across the _cortile_ where the performance was given.[7]\r\n\r\nIn 1487 it was the turn of the _Amphitrio_ ‘in dicto cortile a tempo\r\ndi notte, con uno paradiso cum stelle et altre rode’.[8] Both the\r\n_Amphitrio_ and the _Menaechmi_ were revived in 1491; the former had\r\nits ‘paradiso’, while for the latter ‘nella sala era al prospecto\r\nde quattro castelli, dove avevano a uscire quilli dovevano fare la\r\nrepresentatione’.[9] Many other productions followed, of some of\r\nwhich no details are preserved. For the _Eunuchus_, _Trinummus_,\r\nand _Penulus_ in 1499 there was a stage, 4 ft. high, with decorated\r\ncolumns, hangings of red, white, and green cloth, and ‘cinque casamenti\r\nmerlati’ painted by Fino and Bernardino Marsigli.[10] In 1502, when\r\nLucrezia Borgia came, the stage for the _Epidicus_, _Bacchides_, _Miles\r\nGloriosus_, _Casina_, and _Asinaria_ was of the height of a man, and\r\nresembled a city wall, ‘sopra gli sono le case de le comedie, che sono\r\nsei, non avantagiate del consueto’.[11] The most elaborate description\r\non record is, however, one of a theatre set up at Mantua during the\r\ncarnival of 1501, for some play of which the name has not reached us.\r\nUnfortunately it is not very clearly worded, but the stage appears to\r\nhave been rather wider than its depth, arcaded round, and hung at the\r\nback with gold and greenery. Its base had the priceless decoration of\r\nMantegna’s _Triumphs_, and above was a heaven with a representation of\r\nthe zodiac. Only one ‘casa’ is noted, a ‘grocta’ within four columns at\r\na corner of the stage.[12]\r\n\r\nThe scanty data available seem to point to the existence of two\r\nrather different types of staging, making their appearance at Ferrara\r\nand at Rome respectively. The scene of the Ferrarese comedies, with\r\nits ‘case’ as the principal feature, is hardly distinguishable from\r\nthat of the mediaeval _sacre rappresentazioni_, with its ‘luoghi\r\ndeputati’ for the leading personages, which in their turn correspond\r\nto the ‘loci’, ‘domus’, or ‘sedes’ of the western miracle-plays.[13]\r\nThe methods of the _rappresentazioni_ had long been adopted for\r\npieces in the mediaeval manner, but upon secular themes, such as\r\nPoliziano’s _Favola d’Orfeo_, which continued, side by side with\r\nthe classical comedies, to form part of the entertainment of Duke\r\nErcole’s Court.[14] The persistence of the mediaeval tradition is very\r\nclearly seen in the interspersing of the acts of the comedies, just\r\nas the _rappresentazioni_ had been interspersed, with ‘moresche’ and\r\nother ‘intermedii’ of spectacle and dance, to which the ‘dumb-shows’\r\nof the English drama owe their ultimate origin.[15] At Rome, on the\r\nother hand, it looks as if, at any rate by 1513, the ‘case’ had been\r\nconventionalized, perhaps under the influence of some archaeological\r\ntheory as to classical methods, into nothing more than curtained\r\ncompartments forming part of the architectural embellishments of the\r\n_scena_ wall. It is a tempting conjecture that some reflex, both of the\r\nFerrarese and of the Roman experiments, may be traced in the woodcut\r\nillustrations of a number of printed editions of Terence, which are all\r\nderived from archetypes published in the last decade of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The synchronism between the revival of classical acting and\r\nthe emergence of scenic features in such illustrations is certainly\r\nmarked. The Terentian miniatures of the earlier part of the century\r\nshow no Vitruvian knowledge. If they figure a performance, it is a\r\nrecitation by the wraith Calliopius and his gesticulating mimes.[16]\r\nNor is there any obvious scenic influence in the printed Ulm _Eunuchus_\r\nof 1486, with its distinct background for each separate woodcut.[17]\r\nThe new spirit comes in with the Lyons _Terence_ of 1493, wherein may\r\nbe seen the hand of the humanist Jodocus Badius Ascensius, who had\r\ncertainly visited Ferrara, and may well also have been in touch with\r\nthe Pomponiani.[18] The Lyons woodcuts, of which there are several to\r\neach play, undoubtedly represent stage performances, real or imaginary.\r\nThe stage itself is an unrailed quadrangular platform, of which the\r\nsupports are sometimes visible. The back wall is decorated with\r\nstatuettes and swags of Renaissance ornament, and in front of it is a\r\nrange of three, four, or five small compartments, separated by columns\r\nand veiled by fringed curtains. They have rather the effect of a row of\r\nbathing boxes. Over each is inscribed the name of a character, whose\r\n‘house’ it is supposed to be. Thus for the _Andria_ the inscriptions\r\nare ‘Carini’, ‘Chreme[tis]’, ‘Chrisidis’, ‘Do[mus] Symonis’. On the\r\nscaffold, before the houses, action is proceeding between characters\r\neach labelled with his name. Sometimes a curtain is drawn back and a\r\ncharacter is emerging, or the interior of a house is revealed, with\r\nsome one sitting or in bed, and a window behind. It is noteworthy\r\nthat, while the decoration of the back wall and the arrangement of the\r\nhouses remain uniform through all the woodcuts belonging to any one\r\nplay, they vary from play to play. Sometimes the line of houses follows\r\nthat of the wall; sometimes it advances and retires, and may leave\r\na part of the wall uncovered, suggesting an entrance from without.\r\nIn addition to the special woodcuts for each play, there is a large\r\nintroductory design of a ‘Theatrum’. It is a round building, with\r\nan exterior staircase, to which spectators are proceeding, and are\r\naccosted on their way by women issuing from the ‘Fornices’, over which\r\nthe theatre is built. Through the removal of part of the walls, the\r\ninterior is also made visible. It has two galleries and standing-room\r\nbelow. A box next the stage in the upper gallery is marked ‘Aediles’.\r\nThe stage is cut off by curtains, which are divided by two narrow\r\ncolumns. In front of the curtains sits a flute-player. Above is\r\ninscribed ‘Proscenium’. Some of the Lyons cuts are adopted, with others\r\nfrom the Ulm _Eunuchus_, in the Strasburg _Terence_ of 1496.[19] This,\r\nhowever, has a different ‘Theatrum’, which shows the exterior only, and\r\nalso a new comprehensive design for each play, in which no scaffold\r\nor back wall appears, and the houses are drawn on either side of an\r\nopen place, with the characters standing before them. They are more\r\nrealistic than the Lyons ‘bathing boxes’ and have doors and windows\r\nand roofs, but they are drawn, like the Ulm houses, on a smaller scale\r\nthan the characters. If they have a scenic origin, it may be rather\r\nin the ‘case’ of Ferrara than in the conventional ‘domus’ of Rome.\r\nFinally, the Venice _Terence_ of 1497, while again reproducing with\r\nmodifications the smaller Lyons cuts, replaces the ‘Theatrum’ by a new\r\n‘Coliseus sive Theatrum’, in which the point of view is taken from the\r\nproscenium.[20] No raised stage is visible, but an actor or prologue is\r\nspeaking from a semicircular orchestra on the floor-level. To right and\r\nleft of him are two houses, of the ‘bathing-box’ type, but roofed, from\r\nwhich characters emerge. He faces an auditorium with two rows of seats\r\nand a gallery above.\r\n\r\nWe are moving in shadowy regions of conjecture, and if all the material\r\nwere forthcoming, the interrelations of Rome and Ferrara and the\r\nTerentian editors might prove to have been somewhat different from\r\nthose here sketched. After all, we have not found anything which\r\nquite explains the ‘picturatae scenae facies’ for which Cardinal\r\nRaffaelle Riario won such praise, and perhaps Ferrara is not really\r\nentitled to credit for the innovation, which is generally supposed\r\nto have accompanied the production of the first of Ariosto’s great\r\nItalian comedies on classical lines, the _Cassaria_ of 1508. This\r\nis the utilization for stage scenery of the beloved Italian art of\r\narchitectural perspective. It has been suggested, on no very secure\r\ngrounds, that the first to experiment in this direction may have been\r\nthe architect Bramante Lazzari.[21] But the scene of the _Cassaria_\r\nis the earliest which is described by contemporary observers as a\r\n_prospettiva_, and it evidently left a vivid impression upon the\r\nimagination of the spectators.[22] The artist was Pellegrino da\r\nUdine, and the city represented was Mytilene, where the action of the\r\n_Cassaria_ was laid. The same, or another, example of perspective may\r\nhave served as a background in the following year for Ariosto’s second\r\ncomedy, _I Suppositi_, of which the scene was Ferrara itself.[23]\r\nBut other artists, in other cities, followed in the footsteps of\r\nPellegrino. The designer for the first performance of Bernardo\r\nda Bibbiena’s _Calandra_ at Urbino in 1513 was probably Girolamo\r\nGenga;[24] and for the second, at Rome in 1514, Baldassarre Peruzzi, to\r\nwhom Vasari perhaps gives exaggerated credit for scenes which ‘apersono\r\nla via a coloro che ne hanno poi fatte a’ tempi nostri’.[25] Five\r\nyears later, _I Suppositi_ was also revived at Rome, in the Sala d’\r\nInnocenzio of the Vatican, and on this occasion no less an artist was\r\nemployed than Raphael himself.[26] As well as the scene, there was an\r\nelaborately painted front curtain, which fell at the beginning of the\r\nperformance. For this device, something analogous to which had almost\r\ncertainly already been used at Ferrara, there was a precedent in the\r\nclassical _aulaeum_. Its object was apparently to give the audience\r\na sudden vision of the scene, and it was not raised again during the\r\naction of the play, and had therefore no strictly scenic function.[27]\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth-century _prospettiva_, of which there were many later\r\nexamples, is the type of scenery so fully described and illustrated\r\nby the architect Sebastiano Serlio in the Second Book of his\r\n_Architettura_ (1551). Serlio had himself been the designer of a\r\ntheatre at Vicenza, and had also been familiar at Rome with Baldassarre\r\nPeruzzi, whose notes had passed into his possession. He was therefore\r\nwell in the movement.[28] At the time of the publication of the\r\n_Architettura_ he was resident in France, where he was employed,\r\nlike other Italians, by Francis I upon the palace of Fontainebleau.\r\nExtracts from Serlio’s treatise will be found in an appendix and I need\r\ntherefore only briefly summarize here the system of staging which it\r\nsets out.[29] This is a combination of the more or less solid ‘case’\r\nwith flat cloths painted in perspective. The proscenium is long and\r\ncomparatively shallow, with an entrance at each end, and flat. But from\r\nthe line of the _scena_ wall the level of the stage slopes slightly\r\nupwards and backwards, and on this slope stand to right and left the\r\n‘case’ of boards or laths covered with canvas, while in the centre is\r\na large aperture, disclosing a space across which the flat cloths are\r\ndrawn, a large one at the back and smaller ones on frames projecting\r\nby increasing degrees from behind the ‘case’. Out of these elements\r\nis constructed, by the art of perspective, a consistent scene with\r\narchitectural perspectives facing the audience, and broken in the\r\ncentre by a symmetrical vista. For the sake of variety, the action can\r\nuse practicable doors and windows in the façades, and to some extent\r\nalso within the central aperture, on the lower part of the slope. It\r\nwas possible to arrange for interior action by discovering a space\r\nwithin the ‘case’ behind the façades, but this does not seem to have\r\nbeen regarded as a very effective device.[30] Nor is there anything\r\nto suggest that Serlio contemplated any substantial amount of action\r\nwithin his central recess, for which, indeed, the slope required by\r\nhis principles of perspective made it hardly suitable. As a matter of\r\nfact the action of the Italian _commedia sostenuta_, following here\r\nthe tradition of its Latin models, is essentially exterior action\r\nbefore contiguous houses, and some amusing conventions, as Creizenach\r\nnotes, follow from this fact; such as that it is reasonable to come\r\nout-of-doors in order to communicate secrets, that the street is a good\r\nplace in which to bury treasure, and that you do not know who lives in\r\nthe next house until you are told.[31] In discussing the decoration\r\nof the stage, Serlio is careful to distinguish between the kinds of\r\nscenery appropriate for tragedy, comedy, and the satyric play or\r\npastoral, respectively, herein clearly indicating his debt and that of\r\nhis school to the doctrine of Vitruvius.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Serlio said the last word on Italian\r\nRenaissance staging. He has mainly temporary theatres in his mind, and\r\nwhen theatres became permanent it was possible to replace laths and\r\npainted cloths by a more solid architectural _scena_ in relief. Of\r\nthis type was the famous _Teatro Olympico_ of Vicenza begun by Andrea\r\nPalladio about 1565 and finished by Vincenzo Scamozzi about 1584.[32]\r\nIt closely followed the indications of Vitruvius, with its _porta\r\nregia_ in the middle of the _scena_, its _portae minores_ to right\r\nand left, and its proscenium doors in _versurae_ under balconies for\r\nspectators. And it did not leave room for much variety in decoration,\r\nas between play and play.[33] It appears, indeed, to have been used\r\nonly for tragedy. A more important tendency was really just in the\r\nopposite direction, towards change rather than uniformity of scenic\r\neffect. Even the perspectives, however beautiful, of the comedies\r\ndid not prove quite as amusing, as the opening heavens and hells and\r\nother ingeniously varied backgrounds of the mediaeval plays had been,\r\nand by the end of the sixteenth century devices were being tried for\r\nmovable scenes, which ultimately led to the complete elimination of the\r\ncomparatively solid and not very manageable ‘case’.[34]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say how far the Italian perspective scene made its\r\nway westwards. Mediaeval drama--on the one hand the miracle-play, on\r\nthe other the morality and the farce--still retained an unbounded\r\nvitality in sixteenth-century France. The miracle-play had its own\r\nelaborate and traditional system of staging. The morality and the\r\nfarce required very little staging at all, and could be content at\r\nneed with nothing more than a bare platform, backed by a semicircle\r\nor hollow square of suspended curtains, through the interstices of\r\nwhich the actors might come and go.[35] But from the beginning of\r\nthe century there is observable in educated circles an infiltration\r\nof the humanist interest in the classical drama; and this, in course\r\nof time, was reinforced through two distinct channels. One of these\r\nwas the educational influence, coming indirectly through Germany and\r\nthe Netherlands, of the ‘Christian Terence’, which led about 1540 to\r\nthe academic Latin tragedies of Buchanan and Muretus at Bordeaux.[36]\r\nThe other was the direct contact with humanist civilization, which\r\nfollowed upon the Italian adventures of Charles VIII and Louis XII,\r\nand dominated the reigns of François I and his house, notably after\r\nthe marriage of Catherine de’ Medici to the future Henri II in 1533.\r\nIn 1541 came Sebastiano Serlio with his comprehensive knowledge of\r\nstage-craft; and the translation of his _Architettura_, shortly after\r\nits publication in 1545, by Jean Martin, a friend of Ronsard, may be\r\ntaken as evidence of its vogue. In 1548 the French Court may be said to\r\nhave been in immediate touch with the _nidus_ of Italian scenic art\r\nat Ferrara, for when Henri and Catherine visited Lyons it was Cardinal\r\nHippolyte d’Este who provided entertainment for them with a magnificent\r\nperformance of Bibbiena’s famous _Calandra_. This was ‘nella gran sala\r\ndi San Gianni’ and was certainly staged in the full Italian manner,\r\nwith perspective by Andrea Nannoccio and a range of terra-cotta statues\r\nby one Zanobi.[37] Henceforward it is possible to trace the existence\r\nof a Court drama in France. The Italian influence persisted. It is not,\r\nindeed, until 1571 that we find regular companies of Italian actors\r\nsettling in Paris, and these, when they came, probably played, mainly\r\nif not entirely, _commedie dell’ arte_.[38] But Court performances in\r\n1555 and 1556 of the _Lucidi_ of Firenzuola and the _Flora_ of Luigi\r\nAlamanni show that the _commedia sostenuta_ was already established\r\nin favour at a much earlier date.[39] More important, however, is the\r\noutcrop of vernacular tragedy and comedy, on classical and Italian\r\nmodels, which was one of the literary activities of the Pléiade.\r\nThe pioneer in both _genres_ was Étienne Jodelle, whose tragedy of\r\n_Cléopâtre Captive_ was produced before Henri II by the author and his\r\nfriends at the Hôtel de Reims early in 1553, and subsequently repeated\r\nat the Collège de Boncour, where it was accompanied by his comedy of\r\n_La Rencontre_, probably identical with the extant _Eugène_, which is\r\nbelieved to date from 1552. Jodelle had several successors: in tragedy,\r\nMellin de Saint-Gelais, Jacques and Jean de la Taille, Jacques Grévin,\r\nRobert Garnier, Antoine de Montchrestien; and in comedy, Rémy Belleau,\r\nJean de Baïf, Jean de la Taille, Jacques Grévin, and Pierre Larivey.\r\nSo far as tragedy was concerned, the Court representations soon came\r\nto an end. Catherine de’ Medici, always superstitious, believed that\r\nthe _Sophonisbe_ of Mellin de Saint-Gelais in 1556 had brought ill\r\nluck, and would have no more.[40] The academies may have continued to\r\nfind hospitality for a few, but the best critical opinion appears to\r\nbe that most of the tragedies of Garnier and his fellows were for the\r\nprinting-press only, and that their scenic indications, divorced from\r\nthe actualities of representation, can hardly be regarded as evidence\r\non any system of staging.[41] Probably this is also true of many of the\r\nliterary comedies, although Court performances of comedies, apart from\r\nthose of the professional players, continue to be traceable throughout\r\nthe century. Unfortunately archaeological research has not succeeded in\r\nexhuming from the archives of the French royal households anything that\r\nthrows much light on the details of staging, and very possibly little\r\nmaterial of this kind exists. _Cléopâtre_ is said to have been produced\r\n‘in Henrici II aula ... magnifico veteris scenae apparatu’.[42] The\r\nprologue of _Eugène_, again, apologizes for the meagreness of an\r\nacademic setting:\r\n\r\n    Quand au théâtre, encore qu’il ne soit\r\n    En demi-rond, comme on le compassoit,\r\n    Et qu’on ne l’ait ordonné de la sorte\r\n    Que l’on faisoit, il faut qu’on le supporte:\r\n    Veu que l’exquis de ce vieil ornement\r\n    Ores se voue aux Princes seulement.\r\n\r\nHangings round the stage probably sufficed for the colleges, and\r\npossibly even on some occasions for royal _châteaux_.[43] But Jodelle\r\nevidently envisaged something more splendid as possible at Court,\r\nand a notice, on the occasion of some comedies given before Charles\r\nIX at Bayonne in 1565, of ‘la bravade et magnificence de la dite\r\nscène ou théâtre, et des feux ou verres de couleur, desquelles elle\r\netait allumée et enrichie’ at once recalls a device dear to Serlio,\r\nand suggests a probability that the whole method of staging, which\r\nSerlio expounds, may at least have been tried.[44] Of an actual\r\ntheatre ‘en demi-rond’ at any French palace we have no clear proof.\r\nPhilibert de l’Orme built a _salle de spectacle_ for Catherine in the\r\nTuileries, on a site afterwards occupied by the grand staircase, but\r\nits shape and dimensions are not on record.[45] There was another in\r\nthe pleasure-house, which he planned for Henri II in the grounds of\r\nSaint-Germain, and which was completed by Guillaume Marchand under\r\nHenri IV. This seems, from the extant plan, to have been designed as\r\na parallelogram.[46] The hall of the Hôtel de Bourbon, hard by the\r\nLouvre, in which plays were sometimes given, is shown by the engravings\r\nof the _Balet Comique_, which was danced there in 1581, to have been,\r\nin the main, of similar shape. But it had an apse ‘en demi-rond’ at\r\none end.[47] It may be that the Terence illustrations come again to\r\nour help, and that the new engravings which appear, side by side with\r\nothers of the older tradition, in the _Terence_ published by Jean de\r\nRoigny in 1552 give some notion of the kind of stage which Jodelle and\r\nhis friends used.[48] The view is from the auditorium. The stage is\r\na platform, about 3½ ft. high, with three shallow steps at the back,\r\non which actors are sitting, while a prologue declaims. There are no\r\nhangings or scenes. Pillars divide the back of the stage from a gallery\r\nwhich runs behind and in which stand spectators. Obviously this is not\r\non Italian lines, but it might preserve the memory of some type of\r\nacademic stage.\r\n\r\nIf we know little of the scenic methods of the French Court, we know\r\na good deal of those employed in the only public theatre of which,\r\nduring the sixteenth century and the first quarter of the seventeenth,\r\nParis could boast. This was the Hôtel de Bourgogne, a rectangular hall\r\nbuilt by the Confrérie de la Passion in 1548, used by that body for the\r\nrepresentation of miracle-plays and farces up to 1598, let between 1598\r\nand 1608 to a succession of visiting companies, native and foreign, and\r\ndefinitively occupied from the latter year by the Comédiens du Roi, to\r\nwhom Alexandre Hardy was dramatist in chief.[49] The _Mémoire pour la\r\ndécoration des pièces qui se représentent par les comediens du roy,\r\nentretenus de sa Magesté_ is one of the most valuable documents of\r\ntheatrical history which the hazard of time has preserved in any land.\r\nIt, or rather the earlier of the two sections into which it is divided,\r\nis the work of Laurent Mahelot, probably a machinist at the Hôtel de\r\nBourgogne, and contains notes, in some cases apparently emanating from\r\nthe authors, of the scenery required for seventy-one plays belonging\r\nto the repertory of the theatre, to which are appended, in forty-seven\r\ncases, drawings showing the way in which the requirements were to be\r\nmet.[50] It is true that the _Mémoire_ is of no earlier date than about\r\n1633, but the close resemblance of the system which it illustrates to\r\nthat used in the miracle-plays of the Confrèrie de la Passion justifies\r\nthe inference that there had been no marked breach of continuity since\r\n1598. In essence it is the mediaeval system of juxtaposed ‘maisons’,\r\ncorresponding to the ‘case’ of the Italian and the ‘houses’ of the\r\nEnglish tradition, a series of independent structures, visually related\r\nto each other upon the stage, but dramatically distinct and serving,\r\neach in its turn, as the background to action upon the whole of the\r\nfree space--_platea_ in mediaeval terminology, _proscenium_ in that of\r\nthe Renaissance--which stretched before and between them. The stage\r\nof the Hôtel de Bourgogne had room for five such ‘maisons’, one in\r\nthe middle of the back wall, two in the angles between the back and\r\nside-walls, and two standing forward against the side-walls; but in\r\npractice two or three of these compartments were often devoted to a\r\n‘maison’ of large size. A ‘maison’ might be a unit of architecture,\r\nsuch as a palace, a senate house, a castle, a prison, a temple, a\r\ntavern; or of landscape, such as a garden, a wood, a rock, a cave, a\r\nsea.[51] And very often it represented an interior, such as a chamber\r\nwith a bed in it.[52] A good illustration of the arrangement may be\r\nfound in the _scenario_ for the familiar story of Pyramus and Thisbe,\r\nas dramatized about 1617 by Théophile de Viaud.[53]\r\n\r\n   ‘Il faut, au milieu du théâtre, un mur de marbre et pierre\r\n   fermé; des ballustres; il faut aussi de chasque costé deux ou\r\n   trois marches pour monster. A un des costez du théâtre, un\r\n   murier, un tombeau entouré de piramides. Des fleurs, une éponge,\r\n   du sang, un poignard, un voile, un antre d’où sort un lion,\r\n   du costé de la fontaine, et un autre antre à l’autre bout du\r\n   théâtre où il rentre.’\r\n\r\nThe _Pandoste_ of Alexandre Hardy required different settings for the\r\ntwo parts, which were given on different days.[54] On the first day,\r\n\r\n   ‘Au milieu du théâtre, il faut un beau palais; à un des costez,\r\n   une grande prison où l’on paroist tout entier. A l’autre costé,\r\n   un temple; au dessous, une pointe de vaisseau, une mer basse,\r\n   des rozeaux et marches de degrez.’\r\n\r\nThe needs of the second day were more simply met by ‘deux palais et une\r\nmaison de paysan et un bois’.\r\n\r\nMany examples make it clear that the methods of the Hôtel de Bourgogne\r\ndid not entirely exclude the use of perspective, which was applied\r\non the back wall, ‘au milieu du théâtre’; and as the Italian stage,\r\non its side, was slow to abandon altogether the use of ‘case’ in\r\nrelief, it is possible that under favourable circumstances Mahelot\r\nand his colleagues may have succeeded in producing the illusion of\r\na consistently built up background much upon the lines contemplated\r\nby Serlio.[55] There were some plays whose plot called for nothing\r\nmore than a single continuous scene in a street, perhaps a known and\r\nnameable street, or a forest.[56] Nor was the illusion necessarily\r\nbroken by such incidents as the withdrawal of a curtain from before an\r\ninterior at the point when it came into action, or the introduction of\r\nthe movable ship which the Middle Ages had already known.[57] It was\r\nbroken, however, when the ‘belle chambre’ was so large and practicable\r\nas to be out of scale with the other ‘maisons’.[58] And it was broken\r\nwhen, as in _Pandoste_ and many other plays, the apparently contiguous\r\n‘maisons’ had to be supposed, for dramatic purposes, to be situated in\r\nwidely separated localities. It is, indeed, as we shall find to our\r\ncost, not the continuous scene, but the need for change of scene, which\r\nconstitutes the problem of staging. It is a problem which the Italians\r\nhad no occasion to face; they had inherited, almost unconsciously, the\r\nclassical tradition of continuous action in an unchanged locality,\r\nor in a locality no more changed than is entailed by the successive\r\nbringing into use of various apertures in a single façade. But the\r\nMiddle Ages had had no such tradition, and the problem at once declared\r\nitself, as soon as the matter of the Middle Ages and the manner of\r\nthe Renaissance began to come together in the ‘Christian Terence’.\r\nThe protest of Cornelius Crocus in the preface to his _Joseph_ (1535)\r\nagainst ‘multiple’ staging, as alike intrinsically absurd and alien\r\nto the practice of the ancients, anticipates by many years that law\r\nof the unity of place, the formulation of which is generally assigned\r\nto Lodovico Castelvetro, and which was handed down by the Italians\r\nto the Pléiade and to the ‘classical’ criticism of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.[59] We are not here concerned with the unity of place as a\r\nlaw of dramatic structure, but we are very much concerned with the\r\nfact that the romantic drama of western Europe did not observe unity\r\nof place in actual practice, and that consequently the stage-managers\r\nof Shakespeare in England, as well as those of Hardy in France, had to\r\nface the problem of a system of staging, which should be able rapidly\r\nand intelligibly to represent shifting localities. The French solution,\r\nas we have seen, was the so-called ‘multiple’ system, inherited from\r\nthe Middle Ages, of juxtaposed and logically incongruous backgrounds.\r\n\r\nGeography would be misleading if it suggested that, in the westward\r\ndrift of the Renaissance, England was primarily dependent upon the\r\nmediation of France. During the early Tudor reigns direct relations\r\nwith Italy were firmly established, and the classical scholars of\r\nOxford and Cambridge drew their inspiration at first hand from the\r\nauthentic well-heads of Rome and Florence. In matters dramatic, in\r\nparticular, the insular had little or nothing to learn from the\r\ncontinental kingdom. There were French players, indeed, at the Court\r\nof Henry VII in 1494 and 1495, who obviously at that date can only\r\nhave had farces and morals to contribute.[60] And thereafter the\r\nlines of stimulus may just as well have run the other way. If the\r\nacademic tragedy and comedy of the Pléiade had its reaction upon the\r\ncloset dramas of Lady Pembroke, Kyd, Daniel, Lord Brooke, yet London\r\npossessed its public theatres long before the Parisian makeshift of\r\nthe Hôtel de Bourgogne, and English, no less than Italian, companies\r\nhaunted the Court of Henri IV, while it is not until Caroline days that\r\nthe French visit of 1495 can be shown to have had its successor. The\r\nearliest record of a classical performance in England was at Greenwich\r\non 7 March 1519, when ‘there was a goodly commedy of Plautus plaied’,\r\nfollowed by a mask, in the great chamber, which the King had caused\r\n‘to be staged and great lightes to be set on pillers that were gilt,\r\nwith basons gilt, and the rofe was covered with blewe satyn set full\r\nof presses of fyne gold and flowers’.[61] The staging here spoken of,\r\nin association with lights, was probably for spectators rather than\r\nfor actors, for in May 1527, when a dialogue, barriers, and mask were\r\nto be given in a banqueting-house at Greenwich, we are told that ‘thys\r\nchambre was raised with stages v. degrees on every syde, and rayled\r\nand counterailed, borne by pillars of azure, full of starres and\r\nflower delice of gold; every pillar had at the toppe a basin silver,\r\nwherein stode great braunches of white waxe’.[62] In this same year\r\n1527, Wolsey had a performance of the _Menaechmi_ at his palace of York\r\nPlace, and it was followed in 1528 by one of the _Phormio_, of which\r\na notice is preserved in a letter of Gasparo Spinelli, the secretary\r\nto the Italian embassy in London.[63] Unfortunately, Spinelli’s\r\ndescription proves rather elusive. I am not quite clear whether he is\r\ndescribing the exterior or the interior of a building, and whether his\r\n_zoglia_ is, as one would like to think, the framework of a proscenium\r\narch, or merely that of a doorway.[64] One point, however, is certain.\r\nSomewhere or other, the decorations displayed in golden letters the\r\ntitle of the play which was about to be given. Perhaps this explains\r\nwhy, more than a quarter of a century later, when the Westminster boys\r\nplayed the _Miles Gloriosus_ before Elizabeth in January 1565, one\r\nof the items of expenditure was for ‘paper, inke and colores for the\r\nwryting of greate letters’.[65]\r\n\r\nInvestigation of Court records reveals nothing more precise than\r\nthis as to the staging of plays, whether classical or mediaeval in\r\ntype, under Henry VIII. It is noticeable, however, that a play often\r\nformed but one episode in a composite entertainment, other parts of\r\nwhich required the elaborate pageantry which was Henry’s contribution\r\nto the development of the mask; and it may be conjectured that in\r\nthese cases the structure of the pageant served also as a sufficient\r\nbackground for the play. Thus in 1527 a Latin tragedy celebrating the\r\ndeliverance of the Pope and of France by Wolsey was given in the ‘great\r\nchamber of disguysings’, at the end of which stood a fountain with a\r\nmulberry and a hawthorn tree, about which sat eight fair ladies in\r\nstrange attire upon ‘benches of rosemary fretted in braydes layd on\r\ngold, all the sydes sette wyth roses in braunches as they wer growyng\r\nabout this fountayne’.[66] The device was picturesque enough, but can\r\nonly have had an allegorical relation to the action of the play. The\r\ncopious Revels Accounts of Edward and of Mary are silent about play\r\nsettings. It is only with those of Elizabeth that the indications of\r\n‘houses’ and curtains already detailed in an earlier chapter make their\r\nappearance.[67] The ‘houses’ of lath and canvas have their analogy\r\nalike in the ‘case’ of Ferrara, which even Serlio had not abandoned,\r\nand in the ‘maisons’ which the Hôtel de Bourgogne inherited from the\r\nConfrérie de la Passion. We are left without guide as to whether the\r\nuse of them at the English Court was a direct tradition from English\r\nmiracle-plays, or owed its immediate origin to an Italian practice,\r\nwhich was itself in any case only an outgrowth of mediaeval methods\r\nfamiliar in Italy as well as in England. Nor can we tell, so far as the\r\nRevels Accounts go, whether the ‘houses’ were juxtaposed on the stage\r\nafter the ‘multiple’ fashion of the Hôtel de Bourgogne, or were fused\r\nwith the help of perspective into a continuous façade or vista, as\r\nSerlio bade. Certainly the Revels officers were not wholly ignorant of\r\nthe use of perspective, but this is also true of the machinists of the\r\nHôtel de Bourgogne.[68] Serlio does not appear to have used curtains,\r\nas the Revels officers did, for the discovery of interior scenes, but\r\nif, on the other hand, any of the great curtains of the Revels were\r\nfront curtains, these were employed at Ferrara and Rome, and we have no\r\nknowledge that they were employed at Paris. At this point the archives\r\nleave us fairly in an _impasse_.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to start upon a new tack and to attempt to ascertain,\r\nby an analysis of such early plays as survive, what kind of setting\r\nthese can be supposed, on internal evidence, to have needed. And\r\nthe first and most salient fact which emerges is that a very large\r\nnumber of them needed practically no setting at all. This is broadly\r\ntrue, with exceptions which shall be detailed, of the great group\r\nof interludes which extends over about fifty years of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, from the end of Henry VII’s reign or the beginning of Henry\r\nVIII’s, to a point in Elizabeth’s almost coincident with the opening\r\nof the theatres. Of these, if mere fragments are neglected, there\r\nare not less than forty-five. Twenty are Henrican;[69] perhaps seven\r\nEdwardian or Marian;[70] eighteen Elizabethan.[71] Characteristically,\r\nthey are morals, presenting abstract personages varied in an increasing\r\ndegree with farcical types; but several are semi-morals, with a\r\nsprinkling of concrete personages, which point backwards to the\r\nmiracle-plays, or forward to the romantic or historical drama. One or\r\ntwo are almost purely miracle-play or farce; and towards the end one\r\nor two show some traces of classical influence.[72] Subject, then, to\r\nthe exceptions, the interludes--and this, as already indicated, is a\r\nfundamental point for staging--call for no changes of locality, with\r\nwhich, indeed, the purely abstract themes of moralities could easily\r\ndispense. The action proceeds continuously in a locality, which is\r\neither wholly undefined, or at the most vaguely defined as in London\r\n(_Hickscorner_), or in England (_King Johan_). This is referred to,\r\nboth in stage-directions and in dialogue, as ‘the place’, and with\r\nsuch persistency as inevitably to suggest a term of art, of which the\r\nobvious derivation is from the _platea_ of the miracle-plays.[73] It\r\nmay be either an exterior or an interior place, but often it is not\r\nclearly envisaged as either. In _Pardoner and Friar_ and possibly in\r\n_Johan the Evangelist_ it is a church; in _Johan Johan_ it is Johan’s\r\nhouse. Whether interior or exterior, a door is often referred to as the\r\nmeans of entrance and exit for the characters.[74] In _Johan Johan_ a\r\ndoor is supposed to lead to the priest’s chamber, and there is a long\r\ncolloquy at the ‘chamber dore’. In exterior plays some kind of a house\r\nmay be suggested in close proximity to the ‘place’. In _Youth_ and in\r\n_Four Elements_ the characters come and go to a tavern. The ‘place’ of\r\n_Apius and Virginia_ is before the gate of Apius. There is no obvious\r\nnecessity why these houses should have been represented by anything\r\nbut a door. The properties used in the action are few and simple;\r\na throne or other seat, a table or banquet (_Johan Johan_, _Godly\r\nQueen Hester_, _King Darius_), a hearth (_Nature_, _Johan Johan_), a\r\npulpit (_Johan the Evangelist_), a pail (_Johan Johan_), a dice-board\r\n(_Nice Wanton_). My inference is that the setting of the interludes\r\nwas nothing but the hall in which performances were given, with for\r\nproperties the plenishing of that hall or such movables as could be\r\nreadily carried in. Direct hints are not lacking to confirm this view.\r\nA stage-direction in _Four Elements_ tells us that at a certain point\r\n‘the daunsers without the hall syng’. In _Impatient Poverty_ (242)\r\nAbundance comes in with the greeting, ‘Joye and solace be in this\r\nhall!’ _All for Money_ (1019) uses ‘this hall’, where we should expect\r\n‘this place’. And I think that, apart from interludes woven into the\r\npageantry of Henry VIII’s disguising chambers, the hall contemplated\r\nwas at first just the ordinary everyday hall, after dinner or supper,\r\nwith the sovereigns or lords still on the dais, the tables and benches\r\nbelow pushed aside, and a free space left for the performers on the\r\nfloor, with the screen and its convenient doors as a background and\r\nthe hearth ready to hand if it was wanted to figure in the action. If\r\nI am right, the staged dais, with the sovereign on a high state in the\r\nmiddle of the hall, was a later development, or a method reserved for\r\nvery formal entertainments.[75] The actors of the more homely interlude\r\nwould have had to rub shoulders all the time with the inferior members\r\nof their audience. And so they did. In _Youth_ (39) the principal\r\ncharacter enters, for all the world like the St. George of a village\r\nmummers’ play, with an\r\n\r\n    A backe, felowes, and gyve me roume\r\n    Or I shall make you to auoyde sone.[76]\r\n\r\nIn _Like Will to Like_ the Vice brings in a knave of clubs, which he\r\n‘offreth vnto one of the men or boyes standing by’. In _King Darius_\r\n(109) Iniquity, when he wants a seat, calls out\r\n\r\n    Syrs, who is there that hath a stoole?\r\n    I will buy it for thys Gentleman;\r\n    If you will take money, come as fast as you can.\r\n\r\nA similar and earlier example than any of these now presents itself in\r\n_Fulgens and Lucres_, where there is an inductive dialogue between\r\nspectators, one of whom says to another\r\n\r\n        I thought verely by your apparel,\r\n    That ye had bene a player.\r\n\r\nOf a raised stage the only indication is in _All for Money_, a late\r\nexample of the type, where one stage-direction notes (203), ‘There must\r\nbe a chayre for him to sit in, and vnder it or neere the same there\r\nmust be some hollowe place for one to come vp in’, while another (279)\r\nrequires ‘some fine conueyance’ to enable characters to vomit each\r\nother up.\r\n\r\nI come now to nine interludes which, for various reasons, demand\r\nspecial remark. In _Jacob and Esau_ (> 1558) there is coming and going\r\nbetween the place and the tent of Isaac, before which stands a bench,\r\nthe tent of Jacob, and probably also the tent of Esau. In _Wit and\r\nWisdom_ (> 1579) action takes place at the entrances of the house of\r\nWantonness, of the den of Irksomeness, of a prison, and of Mother Bee’s\r\nhouse, and the prison, as commonly in plays of later types, must have\r\nbeen so arranged as to allow a prisoner to take part in the dialogue\r\nfrom within. Some realism, also, in the treatment of the den may be\r\nsignified by an allusion to ‘these craggie clifts’. In _Misogonus_\r\n(_c._ 1560–77), the place of which is before the house of Philogonus,\r\nthere is one scene in Melissa’s ‘bowre’ (ii. 4, 12), which must somehow\r\nhave been represented. In _Thersites_ (1537), of which one of the\r\ncharacters is a snail that ‘draweth her hornes in’, Mulciber, according\r\nto the stage-directions, ‘must have a shop made in the place’, which he\r\nleaves and returns to, and in which he is perhaps seen making a sallet.\r\nSimilarly, the Mater of Thersites, when she drops out of the dialogue,\r\n‘goeth in the place which is prepared for her’, and hither later\r\n‘Thersites must ren awaye, and hyde hym behynde hys mothers backe’.\r\nThese four examples only differ from the normal interlude type by some\r\nmultiplication of the houses suggested in the background, and probably\r\nby some closer approximation than a mere door to the visual realization\r\nof these. There is no change of locality, and only an adumbration of\r\ninterior action within the houses. Four other examples do entail\r\nsome change of locality. Much stress must not be laid on the sudden\r\nconversions in the fourth act of _The Conflict of Conscience_ (> 1581)\r\nand the last scene of _Three Ladies of London_ of the open ‘place’\r\ninto Court, for these are very belated specimens of the moral. And\r\nthe opening dialogue of the _Three Ladies_, on the way to London, may\r\nglide readily enough into the main action before two houses in London\r\nitself. But in _The Disobedient Child_ (_c._ 1560) some episodes are\r\nbefore the house of the father, and others before that of the son in\r\nanother locality forty miles away. In _Mary Magdalene_ (< 1566), again,\r\nthe action begins in Magdalo, but there is a break (842) when Mary\r\nand the Vice start on their travels, and it is resumed at Jerusalem,\r\nwhere it proceeds first in some public place, and afterwards by a\r\nsudden transition (1557) at a repast within the house of Simon. In both\r\ncases it may be conjectured that the two localities were indicated on\r\nopposite sides of the hall or stage, and that the personages travelled\r\nfrom one to the other over the intervening space, which was regarded\r\nas representing a considerable distance. You may call this ‘multiple\r\nstaging’, if you will. The same imaginative foreshortening of space\r\nhad been employed both in the miracle-plays and in the ‘Christian\r\nTerence’.[77] Simon’s house at Jerusalem was, no doubt, some kind of\r\nopen _loggia_ with a table in it, directly approachable from the open\r\nplace where the earlier part of the Jerusalem action was located.\r\n\r\n_Godly Queen Hester_ (? 1525–9) has a different interest, in that, of\r\nall the forty-four interludes, it affords the only possible evidence\r\nfor the use of a curtain. In most respects it is quite a normal\r\ninterlude. The action is continuous, in a ‘place’, which represents\r\na council-chamber, with a chair for Ahasuerus. But there is no\r\nmention of a door, and while the means of exit and entrance for the\r\nordinary personages are unspecified, the stage-directions note, on\r\ntwo occasions (139, 635) when the King goes out, that he ‘entreth the\r\ntrauerse’. Now ‘traverses’ have played a considerable part in attempts\r\nto reconstruct the Elizabethan theatre, and some imaginative writers\r\nhave depicted them as criss-crossing about the stage in all sorts of\r\npossible and impossible directions.[78] The term is not a very happy\r\none to employ in the discussion of late sixteenth-century or early\r\nseventeenth-century conditions. After _Godly Queen Hester_ it does\r\nnot appear again in any play for nearly a hundred years, and then, so\r\nfar as I know, is only used by Jonson in _Volpone_, where it appears\r\nto indicate a low movable screen, probably of a non-structural kind,\r\nand by John Webster, both in _The White Devil_ and in _The Duchess of\r\nMalfi_, where it is an exact equivalent to the ‘curtains’ or ‘arras’,\r\noften referred to as screening off a recess at the back of the\r\nstage.[79] Half a century later still, it is used in the Restoration\r\nplay of _The Duke of Guise_ to indicate, not this normal back curtain,\r\nbut a screen placed across the recess itself, or the inner stage which\r\nhad developed out of it, behind ‘the scene’.[80] Webster’s use seems\r\nto be an individual one. Properly a ‘traverse’ means, I think, not a\r\ncurtain suspended from the roof, but a screen shutting off from view\r\na compartment within a larger room, but leaving it open above. Such\r\na screen might, of course, very well be formed by a curtain running\r\non a rod or cord.[81] And a ‘traverse’ also certainly came to mean\r\nthe compartment itself which was so shut off.[82] The construction is\r\nfamiliar in the old-fashioned pews of our churches, and as it happens,\r\nit is from the records of the royal chapel that its Elizabethan use can\r\nbest be illustrated. Thus when Elizabeth took her Easter communion at\r\nSt. James’s in 1593, she came down, doubtless from her ‘closet’ above,\r\nafter the Gospel had been read, ‘into her Majestes Travess’, whence\r\nshe emerged to make her offering, and then ‘retorned to her princely\r\ntravess sumptuously sett forthe’, until it was time to emerge again and\r\nreceive the communion. So too, when the Spanish treaty was sworn in\r\n1604, ‘in the chappell weare two traverses sett up of equall state in\r\nall thinges as neare as might be’. One was the King’s traverse ‘where\r\nhe usually sitteth’, the other for the Spanish ambassador, and from\r\nthem they proceeded to ‘the halfe pace’ for the actual swearing of\r\nthe oath.[83] The traverse figures in several other chapel ceremonies\r\nof the time, and it is by this analogy, rather than as a technical\r\nterm of stage-craft, that we must interpret the references to it in\r\n_Godly Queen Hester_. It is not inconceivable that the play, which was\r\nvery likely performed by the Chapel, was actually performed in the\r\nchapel.[84] Nor is it inconceivable, also, that the sense of the term\r\n‘traverse’ may have been wide enough to cover the screen at the bottom\r\nof a Tudor hall.\r\n\r\nI come now to the group of four mid-century farces, _Gammer Gurton’s\r\nNeedle_, _Jack Juggler_, _Ralph Roister Doister_, and _Tom Tyler_,\r\nwhich literary historians have distinguished from the interludes as\r\nearly ‘regular comedies’. No doubt they show traces of Renaissance\r\ninfluence upon their dramatic handling. But, so far as scenic setting\r\nis concerned, they do not diverge markedly from the interlude type.\r\nNor is this surprising, since Renaissance comedy, like the classical\r\ncomedy upon which it was based, was essentially an affair of continuous\r\naction, in an open place, before a background of houses. _Gammer\r\nGurton’s Needle_ requires two houses, those of Gammer Gurton and of\r\nDame Chat; _Jack Juggler_ one, that of Boungrace; _Ralph Roister\r\nDoister_ one, that of Christian Custance. Oddly enough, both _Gammer\r\nGurton’s Needle_ and _Jack Juggler_ contain indications of the presence\r\nof a post, so placed that it could be used in the action.[85] _Tom\r\nTyler_, which may have reached us in a sophisticated text, has a\r\nslightly more complicated staging. There are some quite early features.\r\nThe locality is ‘this place’ (835), and the audience are asked (18), as\r\nin the much earlier _Youth_, to ‘make them room’. On the other hand, as\r\nin _Mary Magdalene_ and in _The Conflict of Conscience_, there is at\r\none point (512) a transition from exterior to interior action. Hitherto\r\nit has been in front of Tom’s house; now it is within, and his wife is\r\nin bed. An open _loggia_ here hardly meets the case. The bed demands\r\nsome discovery, perhaps by the withdrawal of a curtain.\r\n\r\nI am of course aware that the forty-four interludes and the four farces\r\nhitherto dealt with cannot be regarded as forming a homogeneous body\r\nof Court drama. Not one of them, in fact, can be absolutely proved to\r\nhave been given at Court. Several of them bear signs of having been\r\ngiven elsewhere, including at least three of the small number which\r\npresent exceptional features.[86] Others lie under suspicion of having\r\nbeen written primarily for the printing-press, in the hope that any\r\none who cared to act them would buy copies, and may therefore never\r\nhave been given at all; and it is obvious that in such circumstances a\r\nwriter might very likely limit himself to demands upon stage-management\r\nfar short of what the Court would be prepared to meet.[87] This is all\r\ntrue enough, but at the same time I see no reason to doubt that the\r\nsurviving plays broadly represent the kind of piece that was produced,\r\nat Court as well as elsewhere, until well into Elizabeth’s reign.\r\nAmongst their authors are men, Skelton, Medwall, Rastell, Redford,\r\nBale, Heywood, Udall, Gascoigne, who were about the Court, and some\r\nof whom we know to have written plays, if not these plays, for the\r\nCourt; and the survival of the moral as a Court entertainment is borne\r\nwitness to by the Revels Accounts of 1578–9, in which the ‘morrall of\r\nthe _Marriage of Mind and Measure_’ still holds its own beside the\r\nclassical and romantic histories which had already become fashionable.\r\nAs we proceed, however, we come more clearly within the Court sphere.\r\nThe lawyers stand very close, in their interests and their amusements,\r\nto the Court, and with the next group of plays, a characteristically\r\nRenaissance one, of four Italianate comedies and four Senecan\r\ntragedies, the lawyers had a good deal to do. Gascoigne’s Gray’s\r\nInn _Supposes_ is based directly upon one of Ariosto’s epoch-making\r\ncomedies, _I Suppositi_, and adopts its staging. Jeffere’s _Bugbears_\r\nand the anonymous _Two Italian Gentlemen_ are similarly indebted\r\nto their models in Grazzini’s _La Spiritata_ and Pasqualigo’s _Il\r\nFedele_. Each preserves complete unity of place, and the continuous\r\naction in the street before the houses, two or three in number, of the\r\nprincipal personages, is only varied by occasional colloquies at a door\r\nor window, and in the case of the _Two Italian Gentlemen_ by an episode\r\nof concealment in a tomb which stands in a ‘temple’ or shrine beneath\r\na burning lamp. Whetstone’s _Promos and Cassandra_, the neo-classical\r\ninspiration of which is advertised in the prefatory epistle, follows\r\nthe same formula with a certain freedom of handling. In the first part,\r\nopportunity for a certain amount of interior action is afforded by\r\ntwo of the three houses; one is a prison, the other a barber’s shop,\r\npresumably an open stall with a door and a flap-down shutter. The third\r\nis the courtesan’s house, on which Serlio insists. This reappears in\r\nthe second part and has a window large enough for four women to sit\r\nin.[88] The other houses in this part are a temple with a tomb in it,\r\nand a pageant stage used at a royal entry. The conveniences of exterior\r\naction lead to a convention which often recurs in later plays, by which\r\nroyal justice is dispensed in the street. And the strict unity of place\r\nis broken by a scene (iv. 2) which takes place, not like the rest of\r\nthe action in the town of Julio, but in a wood through which the actors\r\nare approaching it. Here also we have, I think, the beginnings of a\r\nconvention by which action on the extreme edge of a stage, or possibly\r\non the floor of the hall or on steps leading to the stage, was treated\r\nas a little remote from the place represented by the setting in the\r\nbackground. The four tragedies were all produced at the Court itself\r\nby actors from the Inns of Court. It is a little curious that the\r\nearliest of the four, _Gorboduc_ (1562), is also the most regardless\r\nof the unity of place. While Acts I and III-V are at the Court of\r\nGorboduc, Act II is divided between the independent Courts of Ferrex\r\nand Porrex. We can hardly suppose that there was any substantial change\r\nof decoration, and probably the same generalized palace background\r\nserved for all three. Here also the convention, classical enough,\r\nrules, by which the affairs of state are conducted in the open. By 1562\r\nthe raised stage had clearly established itself. There are no regular\r\nstage-directions in _Gorboduc_, but the stage is often mentioned in the\r\ndescriptions of the dumb-shows between the acts, and in the fourth of\r\nthese ‘there came from vnder the stage, as though out of hell, three\r\nfuries’. Similarly in _Jocasta_ (1566) the stage opens in the dumb-shows\r\nto disclose, at one time a grave, at another the gulf of Curtius.\r\nThe action of the play itself is before the palace of Jocasta, but\r\nthere are also entrances and exits, which are carefully specified in\r\nstage-directions as being through ‘the gates called Electrae’ and ‘the\r\ngates called Homoloydes’. Perhaps we are to infer that the gates which,\r\nif the stage-manager had Vitruvius in mind, would have stood on the\r\nright and left of the proscenium, were labelled ‘in great letters’ with\r\ntheir names; and if so, a similar device may have served in _Gorboduc_\r\nto indicate at which of the three Courts action was for the time being\r\nproceeding. _Gismond of Salerne_ has not only a hell, for Megaera, but\r\nalso a heaven, for the descent and ascent of Cupid. Like _Jocasta_, it\r\npreserves unity of place, but it has two houses in the background, the\r\npalace of Tancred and an independent ‘chamber’ for Gismond, which is\r\nopen enough and deep enough to allow part of the action, with Gismond\r\nlying poisoned and Tancred mourning over her, to take place within it.\r\n_The Misfortunes of Arthur_ is, of course, twenty years later than\r\nthe other members of the group. But it is true to type. The action\r\nis in front of three _domus_, the ‘houses’ of Arthur and of Mordred,\r\nwhich ought not perhaps historically to have been in the same city,\r\nand a cloister. A few years later still, in 1591, Wilmot, one of the\r\nauthors of _Gismond of Salerne_, rewrote it as _Tancred and Gismund_.\r\nHe did not materially interfere with the old staging, but he added an\r\nepilogue, of which the final couplet runs:\r\n\r\n    Thus end our sorrowes with the setting sun:\r\n    Now draw the curtens for our Scaene is done.\r\n\r\nIf these lines had occurred in the original version of the play, they\r\nwould naturally have been taken as referring to curtains used to cover\r\nand discover Gismond’s death-chamber. But in this point Wilmot has\r\nmodified the original action, and has made Gismund take her poison and\r\ndie, not in her chamber, but on the open stage. Are we then faced,\r\nas part of the paraphernalia of a Court stage, at any rate by 1591,\r\nwith a front curtain--a curtain drawn aside, and not sinking like the\r\ncurtains of Ferrara and Rome, but like those curtains used to mark the\r\nbeginning and end of a play, rather than to facilitate any changing\r\nof scenes?[89] It is difficult to say. Wilmot, not re-writing for the\r\nstage, may have rewritten loosely. Or the epilogue may after all have\r\nbelonged to the first version of the play, and have dropped out of the\r\nmanuscript in which that version is preserved. The Revels Accounts\r\ntestify that ‘great curtains’ were used in Court plays, but certainly\r\ndo not prove that they were used as front curtains. The nearest\r\napproach to a corroboration of Wilmot is to be found in an epigram\r\nwhich exists in various forms, and is ascribed in some manuscripts to\r\nSir Walter Raleigh.[90]\r\n\r\n    What is our life? a play of passion.\r\n    Our mirth? the musick of diuision.\r\n    Our mothers wombs the tyring houses bee\r\n    Where we are drest for liues short comedy.\r\n    The earth the stage, heauen the spectator is,\r\n    Who still doth note who ere do act amisse.\r\n    Our graues, that hyde vs from the all-seeing sun,\r\n    Are but drawne curtaynes when the play is done.\r\n\r\nIf these four comedies and four tragedies were taken alone, it\r\nwould, I think, be natural to conclude that, with the Italianized\r\ntypes of drama, the English Court had also adopted the Italian type\r\nof setting.[91] Certainly the tragedies would fit well enough into\r\nSerlio’s stately façade of palaces, and the comedies into his more\r\nhomely group of bourgeois houses, with its open shop, its ‘temple’, and\r\nits discreet abode of a _ruffiana_.[92]\r\n\r\nAs courtly, beyond doubt, we must treat the main outlook of the choir\r\ncompanies during their long hegemony of the Elizabethan drama, which\r\nended with the putting down of Paul’s in 1590. Unfortunately it is not\r\nuntil the last decade of this period, with the ‘court comedies’ of\r\nLyly, that we have any substantial body of their work, differentiated\r\nfrom the interludes and the Italianate comedies, to go upon. The _Damon\r\nand Pythias_ of Richard Edwardes has a simple setting before the gates\r\nof a court. Lyly’s own methods require rather careful analysis.[93] The\r\nlocality of _Campaspe_ is throughout at Athens, in ‘the market-place’\r\n(III. ii. 56).[94] On this there are three _domus_: Alexander’s palace,\r\nprobably represented by a portico in which he receives visitors, and\r\nfrom which inmates ‘draw in’ (IV. iii. 32) to get off the stage; a\r\ntub ‘turned towardes the sun’ (I. iii. 12) for Diogenes over which he\r\ncan ‘pry’ (V. iii. 21); a shop for Apelles, which has a window (III.\r\ni. 18), outside which a page is posted, and open enough for Apelles\r\nto carry on dialogue with Campaspe (III. iii.; IV. iv), while he\r\npaints her within. These three _domus_ are quite certainly all visible\r\ntogether, as continuous action can pass from one to another. At one\r\npoint (I. iii. 110) the philosophers walk direct from the palace to the\r\ntub; at another (III. iv. 44, 57) Alexander, going to the shop, passes\r\nthe tub on the way; at a third (V. iv. 82) Apelles, standing at the\r\ntub, is bidden ‘looke about you, your shop is on fire!’ As Alexander\r\n(V. iv. 71) tells Diogenes that he ‘wil haue thy cabin remoued nerer\r\nto my court’, I infer that the palace and the tub were at opposite\r\nends of the stage, and the shop in the middle, where the interior\r\naction could best be seen. In _Sapho and Phao_ the unity of place is\r\nnot so marked. All the action is more or less at Syracuse, but, with\r\nthe exception of one scene (II. iii), the whole of the first two acts\r\nare near Phao’s ferry outside the city. I do not think that the actual\r\nferry is visible, for passengers go ‘away’ (I. i. 72; ii. 69) to cross,\r\nand no use is made of a ferryman’s house, but somewhere quite near\r\nSibylla sits ‘in the mouth of her caue’ (II. i. 13), and talks with\r\nPhao.[95] The rest of the action is in the city itself, either before\r\nthe palace of Sapho, or within her chamber, or at the forge of Vulcan,\r\nwhere he is perhaps seen ‘making of the arrowes’ (IV. iv. 33) during a\r\nsong. Certainly Sapho’s chamber is practicable. The stage-directions\r\ndo not always indicate its opening and shutting. At one point (III.\r\niii. 1) we simply get ‘Sapho in her bed’ in a list of interlocutors;\r\nat another (IV. i. 20) ‘Exit Sapho’, which can only mean that the door\r\ncloses upon her. It was a door, not a curtain, for she tells a handmaid\r\n(V. ii. 101) to ‘shut’ it. Curtains are ‘drawne’ (III. iii. 36; IV.\r\niii. 95), but these are bed-curtains, and the drawing of them does not\r\nput Sapho’s chamber in or out of action. As in _Campaspe_, there is\r\ninterplay between house and house. A long continuous stretch of action,\r\nnot even broken by the act-intervals, begins with III. iii and extends\r\nto the end of V. ii, and in the course of this Venus sends Cupid to\r\nSapho, and herself waits at Vulcan’s forge (V. i. 50). Presently (V.\r\nii. 45) she gets tired of waiting, and without leaving the stage,\r\nadvances to the chamber and says, ‘How now, in Saphoes lap?’ There is\r\nnot the same interplay between the city houses and Sibylla’s cave, to\r\nwhich the last scene of the play returns. I think we must suppose that\r\ntwo neighbouring spots within the same general locality were shown\r\nin different parts of the stage, and this certainly entails a bolder\r\nuse of dramatic foreshortening of distance than the mere crossing the\r\nmarket-place in _Campaspe_. This foreshortening recurs in _Endymion_.\r\nMost of the action is in an open place which must be supposed to be\r\nnear the palace of Cynthia, or at the lunary bank (II. iii. 9), of\r\nEndymion’s slumber, which is also near the palace.[96] It stands in a\r\ngrove (IV. iii. 160), and is called a ‘caban’ (IV. iii. 111). Somewhere\r\nalso in the open space is, in Act V, the aspen-tree, into which Dipsas\r\nhas turned Bagoa and from which she is delivered (V. iii. 283). But\r\nIII. ii and IV. i are at the door of ‘the Castle in the Deserte’ (III.\r\ni. 41; ii. 1) and III. iv is also in the desert (cf. V. iii. 35),\r\nbefore a fountain. This fountain was, however, ‘hard by’ the lunary\r\nbank (IV. ii. 67), and probably the desert was no farther off than\r\nthe end of the stage.[97] In _Midas_ the convention of foreshortening\r\nbecomes inadequate, and we are faced with a definite change of\r\nlocality. The greater part of the play is at the Court of Midas,\r\npresumably in Lydia rather than in Phrygia, although an Elizabethan\r\naudience is not likely to have been punctilious about Anatolian\r\ngeography. Some scenes require as background a palace, to which it is\r\npossible to go ‘in’ (I. i. 117; II. ii. 83; III. iii. 104). A temple\r\nof Bacchus may also have been represented, but is not essential. Other\r\nscenes are in a neighbouring spot, where the speaking reeds grow. There\r\nis a hunting scene (IV. i) on ‘the hill Tmolus’ (cf. V. iii. 44). So\r\nfar Lyly’s canons of foreshortening are not exceeded. But the last\r\nscene (V. iii) is out of the picture altogether. The opening words are\r\n‘This is Delphos’, and we are overseas, before the temple of Apollo. In\r\n_Galathea_ and in _Love’s Metamorphosis_, on the other hand, unity is\r\nfully achieved. The whole of _Galathea_ may well proceed in a single\r\nspot, on the edge of a wood, before a tree sacred to Neptune, and in\r\nLincolnshire (I. iv. 12). The sea is hard by, but need not be seen.\r\nThe action of _Love’s Metamorphosis_ is rather more diffuse, but an\r\nall-over pastoral setting, such as we see in Serlio’s _scena satirica_,\r\nwith scattered _domus_ in different glades, would serve it. Or, as\r\nthe management of the Hôtel de Bourgogne would have put it, the stage\r\nis _tout en pastoralle_. There are a tree of Ceres and a temple of\r\nCupid. These are used successively in the same scene (II. i). Somewhat\r\napart, on the sea-shore, but close to the wood, dwells Erisichthon.\r\nThere is a rock for the Siren, and Erisichthon’s house may also have\r\nbeen shown.[98] Finally, _Mother Bombie_ is an extreme example of the\r\ntraditional Italian comic manner. The action comes and goes, rapidly\r\nfor Lyly, in an open place, surrounded by no less than seven houses,\r\nthe doors of which are freely used.\r\n\r\nTwo other Chapel plays furnish sufficient evidence that the type of\r\nstaging just described was not Lyly’s and Lyly’s alone.[99] Peele’s\r\n_Arraignment of Paris_ is _tout en pastoralle_. A poplar-tree dominates\r\nthe stage throughout, and the only house is a bower of Diana, large\r\nenough to hold the council of gods (381, 915). A trap is required\r\nfor the rising and sinking of a golden tree (489) and the ascent of\r\nPluto (902). Marlowe’s _Dido_ has proved rather a puzzle to editors\r\nwho have not fully appreciated the principles on which the Chapel\r\nplays were produced. I think that one side of the stage was arranged\r\n_en pastoralle_, and represented the wood between the sea-shore and\r\nCarthage, where the shipwrecked Trojans land and where later Aeneas\r\nand Dido hunt. Here was the cave where they take shelter from the\r\nstorm.[100] Here too must have been the curtained-off _domus_ of\r\nJupiter.[101] This is only used in a kind of prelude. Of course it\r\nought to have been in heaven, but the Gods are omnipresent, and it\r\nis quite clear that when the curtain is drawn on Jupiter, Venus, who\r\nhas been discoursing with him, is left in the wood, where she then\r\nmeets Aeneas (134, 139, 173). The other side of the stage represents\r\nCarthage. Possibly a wall with a gate in it was built across the stage,\r\ndividing off the two regions. In the opening line of Act II, Aeneas\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n    Where am I now? these should be Carthage walles,\r\n\r\nand we must think of him as advancing through the wood to the\r\ngate.[102] He is amazed at a carved or printed representation of Troy,\r\nwhich Virgil placed in a temple of Juno, but which Marlowe probably\r\nthought of as at the gate. He meets other Trojans who have already\r\nreached the city, and they call his attention to Dido’s servitors, who\r\n‘passe through the hall’ bearing a banquet. Evidently he is now within\r\nthe city and has approached a _domus_ representing the palace. The\r\nso-called ‘hall’ is probably an open _loggia_. Here Dido entertains\r\nhim, and in a later scene (773) points out to him the pictures of her\r\nsuitors. There is perhaps an altar in front of the palace, where Iarbas\r\ndoes his sacrifice (1095), and somewhere close by a pyre is made for\r\nDido (1692). Either within or without the walls may be the grove in\r\nwhich Ascanius is hidden while Cupid takes his place.[103] If, as is\r\nmore probable, it is without, action passes through the gate when Venus\r\nbeguiles him away. It certainly does at the beginning (912, 960) and\r\nend (1085) of the hunt, and again when Aeneas first attempts flight and\r\nAnna brings him back from the sea-shore (1151, 1207).\r\n\r\nThe plays of the Lylyan school, if one may so call it, seem to me to\r\nillustrate very precisely, on the side of staging, that blend of the\r\nclassical and the romantic tempers which is characteristic of the later\r\nRenaissance. The mediaeval instinct for a story, which the Elizabethans\r\nfully shared, is with difficulty accommodated to the form of an action\r\ncoherent in place and time, which the Italians had established on the\r\nbasis of Latin comedy. The Shakespearian romantic drama is on the\r\npoint of being born. Lyly and his fellow University wits deal with\r\nthe problem to the best of their ability. They widen the conception\r\nof locality, to a city and its environs instead of a street; and even\r\nthen the narrative sometimes proves unmanageable, and the distance\r\nfrom one end of the stage to the other must represent a foreshortening\r\nof leagues, or even of the crossing of an ocean. In the hands of less\r\nskilful workmen the tendency was naturally accentuated, and plays had\r\nbeen written, long before Lyly was sent down from Magdalen, in which\r\nthe episodes of breathless adventure altogether overstepped the most\r\nelastic confines of locality. A glance at the titles of the plays\r\npresented at Court during the second decade of Elizabeth’s reign will\r\nshow the extent to which themes drawn from narrative literature were\r\nalready beginning to oust those of the old interlude type.[104] The\r\nnew development is apparent in the contributions both of men and of\r\nboys; with this distinction, that the boys find their sources mainly\r\nin the storehouse of classical history and legend, while the men turn\r\neither to contemporary events at home and abroad, or more often to the\r\nbelated and somewhat jaded versions, still dear to the Elizabethan\r\nlaity, of mediaeval romance. The break-down of the Italian staging must\r\ntherefore be regarded from the beginning, as in part at least a result\r\nof the reaction of popular taste upon that of the Court. The noblemen’s\r\nplayers came to London when the winter set in, and brought with them\r\nthe pieces which had delighted _bourgeois_ and village audiences up\r\nand down the land throughout the summer; and on the whole it proved\r\neasier for the Revels officers to adapt the stage to the plays than the\r\nplays to the stage. Nor need it be doubted that, even in so cultivated\r\na Court as that of Elizabeth, the popular taste was not without its\r\nechoes.\r\n\r\nOf all this wealth of forgotten play-making, only five examples\r\nsurvive; but they are sufficient to indicate the scenic trend.[105]\r\nTheir affiliation with the earlier interludes is direct. The ‘vice’ and\r\nother moral abstractions still mingle with the concrete personages,\r\nand the proscenium is still the ‘place’.[106] The simplest setting is\r\nthat of _Cambyses_. All is at or within sight of the Persian Court.\r\nIf any _domus_ was represented, it was the palace, to which there are\r\ndepartures (567, 929). Cambyses consults his council (1–125) and there\r\nis a banquet (965–1042) with a ‘boorde’, at the end of which order\r\nis given to ‘take all these things away’.[107] In other episodes the\r\nCourt is ‘yonder’ (732, 938); it is only necessary to suppose that they\r\nwere played well away from the _domus_. One is in a ‘feeld so green’\r\n(843–937), and a stage-direction tells us ‘Heere trace up and downe\r\nplaying’. In another (754–842) clowns are on their way to market.[108]\r\nThe only other noteworthy point is that, not for the first nor for\r\nthe last time, a post upon the stage is utilized in the action.[109]\r\n_Patient Grissell_, on the other hand, requires two localities. The\r\nmore important is Salucia (Saluzzo), where are Gautier’s mansion,\r\nJanickell’s cottage, and the house of Mother Apleyarde, a midwife\r\n(1306). The other is Bullin Lagras (Bologna), where there are two short\r\nepisodes (1235–92, 1877–1900) at the house of the Countess of Pango.\r\nThere can be little doubt that all the _domus_ were staged at once.\r\nThere is direct transfer of action from Gautier’s to the cottage and\r\nback again (612–34; cf. 1719, 2042, 2090). Yet there is some little\r\ndistance between, for when a messenger is sent, the foreshortening of\r\nspace is indicated by the stage-direction (1835), ‘Go once or twise\r\nabout the Staige’.[110] Similarly, unless an ‘Exiunt’ has dropped\r\nout, there is direct transfer (1900) from Bullin Lagras to Salucia.\r\nIn _Orestes_ the problem of discrete localities is quite differently\r\nhandled. The play falls into five quasi-acts of unequal length, which\r\nare situated successively at Mycenae, Crete, Mycenae, Athens, Mycenae.\r\nFor all, as in _Gorboduc_, the same sketchy palace background might\r\nserve, with one interesting and prophetic exception. The middle\r\nepisodes (538–925), at Mycenae, afford the first example of those siege\r\nscenes which the Shakespearian stage came to love. A messenger brings\r\nwarning to Aegisthus and Clytemnestra of the purpose of Orestes ‘to\r\ninuade this Mycoene Citie stronge’. Aegisthus goes into the ‘realme’,\r\nto take up men, and Clytemnestra will defend the city. There is a\r\nquarrel between a soldier and a woman and the Vice sings a martial\r\nsong. Then ‘Horestes entrith with his bande and marcheth about the\r\nstage’. He instructs a Herald, who advances with his trumpeter. ‘Let\r\ny^e trumpet go towarde the Citie and blowe.’ Clytemnestra answers. ‘Let\r\ny^e trumpet leaue soundyng and let Harrauld speake and Clytemnestra\r\nspeake ouer y^e wal.’ Summons and defiance follow, and Orestes calls\r\non his men for an assault. ‘Go and make your liuely battel and let it\r\nbe longe, eare you can win y^e Citie, and when you haue won it, let\r\nHorestes bringe out his mother by the armes, and let y^e droum sease\r\nplaying and the trumpet also, when she is taken.’ But now Aegisthus\r\nis at hand. ‘Let Egistus enter and set hys men in a raye, and let the\r\ndrom play tyll Horestes speaketh.’ There is more fighting, which ends\r\nwith the capture and hanging of Aegisthus. ‘Fling him of y^e lader,\r\nand then let on bringe in his mother Clytemnestra; but let her loke\r\nwher Egistus hangeth’. Finally Orestes announces that ‘Enter now we\r\nwyll the citie gate’. In the two other plays the changes of locality\r\ncome thick and fast. The action of _Clyomon and Clamydes_ begins in\r\nDenmark, and passes successively to Swabia, to the Forest of Marvels\r\non the borders of Macedonia, to the Isle of Strange Marshes twenty\r\ndays’ sail from Macedonia, to the Forest again, to the Isle again,\r\nto Norway, to the Forest, to the Isle, to the Forest, to a road near\r\nDenmark, to the Isle, to Denmark. Only two _domus_ are needed, a\r\npalace (733) in the Isle, and Bryan Sans Foy’s Castle in the Forest.\r\nThis is a prison, with a practicable door and a window, from which\r\nClamydes speaks (872). At one point Providence descends and ascends\r\n(1550–64). In one of the Forest scenes a hearse is brought in and it\r\nis still there in the next (1450, 1534), although a short Isle scene\r\nhas intervened. This looks as though the two ends of the stage may\r\nhave been assigned throughout to the two principal localities, the\r\nForest and the Isle. Some care is taken to let the speakers give the\r\naudience a clue when a new locality is made use of for the first time.\r\nAfterwards the recurrence of characters whom they had already seen\r\nwould help them. The Norway episode (1121) is the only one which need\r\nhave much puzzled them. But _Clyomon and Clamydes_ may have made use of\r\na peculiar device, which becomes apparent in the stage-directions of\r\n_Common Conditions_. The play opens in Arabia, where first a spot near\r\nthe Court and then a wood are indicated; but the latter part alternates\r\nbetween Phrygia, near the sea-shore, and the Isle of Marofus. No\r\n_domus_ is necessary, and it must remain uncertain whether the wood\r\nwas represented by visualized trees. It is introduced (295) with the\r\nstage-direction, ‘Here enter Sedmond with Clarisia and Condicions\r\nout of the wood’. Similarly Phrygia is introduced (478) with ‘Here\r\nentreth Galiarbus out of Phrygia’, and a few lines later (510) we get\r\n‘Here enter Lamphedon out of Phrygia’. Now it is to be noted that the\r\nepisodes which follow these directions are not away from, but in the\r\nwood and Phrygia respectively; and the inference has been drawn that\r\nthere were labelled doors, entrance through one of which warned the\r\nspectators that action was about to take place in the locality whose\r\ntitle the label bore.[111] This theory obtains some plausibility from\r\nthe use of the gates Homoloydes and Electrae in _Jocasta_; and perhaps\r\nalso from the inscribed house of the _ruffiana_ in Serlio’s _scena\r\ncomica_, from the early Terence engravings, and from certain examples\r\nof lettered _mansions_ in French miracle-plays.[112] But of course\r\nthese analogies do not go the whole way in support of a practice of\r\nusing differently lettered entrances to help out an imagined conversion\r\nof the same ‘place’ into different localities. More direct confirmation\r\nmay perhaps be derived from Sidney’s criticism of the contemporary\r\ndrama in his _Defence of Poesie_ (_c._ 1583). There are two passages to\r\nbe cited.[113] The first forms part of an argument that poets are not\r\nliars. Their feigning is a convention, and is accepted as such by their\r\nhearers. ‘What Childe is there’, says Sidney, ‘that, comming to a Play,\r\nand seeing _Thebes_ written in great letters vpon an olde doore, doth\r\nbeleeue that it is _Thebes_?’ Later on he deals more formally with the\r\nstage, as a classicist, writing after the unity of place had hardened\r\ninto a doctrine. Even _Gorboduc_ is no perfect tragedy.\r\n\r\n   ‘For it is faulty both in place and time, the two necessary\r\n   companions of all corporall actions. For where the stage\r\n   should alwaies represent but one place, and the vttermost time\r\n   presupposed in it should be, both by _Aristotles_ precept and\r\n   common reason, but one day, there is both many dayes, and many\r\n   places, inartificially imagined. But if it be so in _Gorboduck_,\r\n   how much more in al the rest? where you shal haue _Asia_ of\r\n   the one side, and _Affrick_ of the other, and so many other\r\n   vnder-kingdoms, that the Player, when he commeth in, must\r\n   ever begin with telling where he is, or els the tale wil not\r\n   be conceiued. Now ye shal haue three ladies walke to gather\r\n   flowers, and then we must beleeue the stage to be a Garden. By\r\n   and by, we heare newes of shipwracke in the same place, and\r\n   then wee are to blame if we accept it not for a Rock. Vpon the\r\n   backe of that, comes out a hidious Monster, with fire and smoke,\r\n   and then the miserable beholders are bounde to take it for a\r\n   Caue. While in the meantime two Armies flye in, represented with\r\n   foure swords and bucklers, and then what harde heart will not\r\n   receiue it for a pitched fielde?’\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the plays which Sidney has mostly in mind, the\r\n‘al the rest’ of his antithesis with _Gorboduc_, are precisely those\r\nromantic histories which the noblemen’s players in particular were\r\nbringing to Court in his day, and of which _Clyomon and Clamydes_ and\r\n_Common Conditions_ may reasonably be taken as the characteristic\r\ndébris. He hints at what we might have guessed that, where changes\r\nof scene were numerous, the actual visualization of the different\r\nscenes left much to the imagination. He lays his finger upon the\r\nforeshortening, which permits the two ends of the stage to stand\r\nfor localities separated by a considerable distance, and upon the\r\nobligation which the players were under to let the opening phrases of\r\ntheir dialogue make it clear where they were supposed to be situated.\r\nAnd it certainly seems from the shorter passage, as if he was also\r\nfamiliar with an alternative or supplementary device of indicating\r\nlocality by great letters on a door. The whole business remains rather\r\nobscure. What happened if the distinct localities were more numerous\r\nthan the doors? Were the labels shifted, or were the players then\r\ndriven, as Sidney seems to suggest, to rely entirely upon the method\r\nof spoken hints? The labelling of special doors with great letters\r\nmust be distinguished from the analogous use of great letters, as\r\nat the _Phormio_ of 1528, to publish the title of a play.[114] That\r\nthis practice also survived in Court drama may be inferred from Kyd’s\r\n_Spanish Tragedy_, in which Hieronimo gives a Court play, and bids\r\nhis assistant (IV. iii. 17) ‘hang up the Title: Our scene is Rhodes’.\r\nEven if the ‘scene’ formed part of the title in such cases, it would\r\nonly name a generalized locality or localities for the play, and would\r\nnot serve as a clue to the localization of individual episodes.[115]\r\nA retrospect over this discussion of Tudor staging, which is mainly\r\nCourt staging, up to a point well subsequent to the establishment of\r\nthe first regular theatres, seems to offer the following results. The\r\nearliest interludes, other than revivals of Plautus and Terence or\r\nelements in spectacular disguisings, limited themselves to the setting\r\nof the hall in which they were performed, with its doors, hearth, and\r\nfurniture. In such conditions either exterior or interior action could\r\nbe indifferently represented. This arrangement, however, soon ceased\r\nto satisfy, in the Court at any rate, the sixteenth-century love of\r\ndecoration; and one or more houses were introduced into the background,\r\nprobably on a Renaissance rather than a mediaeval suggestion, through\r\nwhich, as well as the undifferentiated doors, the personages could\r\ncome and go. The addition of an elevated stage enabled traps to be\r\nused (_All for Money_, _Gorboduc_, _Jocasta_, _Gismond of Salerne_,\r\n_Arraignment of Paris_); but here, as in the corresponding device of\r\na descent from above (_Gismond of Salerne_, _Clyomon and Clamydes_),\r\nit is the mediaeval grading for heaven and hell which lies behind the\r\nRenaissance usage. With houses in the background, the normal action\r\nbecomes uniformly exterior. If a visit is paid to a house, conversation\r\ntakes place at its door rather than within. The exceptions are rare and\r\ntentative, amounting to little more than the provision of a shallow\r\nrecess within a house, from which personages, usually one or two only,\r\ncan speak. This may be a window (_Two Italian Gentlemen_, _Promos\r\nand Cassandra_), a prison (_Wit and Wisdom_, _Promos and Cassandra_,\r\n_Clyomon and Clamydes_), a bower (_Misogonus_, _Endymion_, _Dido_,\r\n_Arraignment of Paris_), a tub (_Campaspe_), a shrine or tomb (_Two\r\nItalian Gentlemen_, _Promos and Cassandra_), a shop (_Thersites_,\r\n_Promos and Cassandra_, _Campaspe_, _Sapho and Phao_), a bedchamber\r\n(_Gismund of Salerne_, _Tom Tyler_, _Sapho and Phao_). Somewhat\r\nmore difficulty is afforded by episodes in which there is a banquet\r\n(_Mary Magdalene_, _Dido_, _Cambyses_), or a law court (_Conflict\r\nof Conscience_), or a king confers with his councillors (_Midas_,\r\n_Cambyses_). These, according to modern notions, require the setting of\r\na hall; but my impression is that the Italianized imagination of the\r\nElizabethans was content to accept them as taking place more or less\r\nout-of-doors, on the steps or in the cortile of a palace, with perhaps\r\nsome arcaded _loggia_, such as Serlio suggests, in the background,\r\nwhich would be employed when the action was supposed to be withdrawn\r\nfrom the public market-place or street. And this convention I believe\r\nto have lasted well into the Shakespearian period.[116]\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of this scheme of staging is broken into, when a\r\nmediaeval survival or the popular instinct for storytelling faces\r\nthe producer with a plot incapable of continuous presentation in\r\na single locality. A mere foreshortening of the distance between\r\nhouses conceived as surrounding one and the same open _platea_, or as\r\ndispersed in the same wood, is hardly felt as a breach of unity. But\r\nthe principle is endangered, when action within a city is diversified\r\nby one or more ‘approach’ episodes, in which the edge of the stage\r\nor the steps leading up to it must stand for a road or a wood in the\r\nenvirons (_Promos and Cassandra_, _Sapho and Phao_, _Dido_). It is\r\non the point of abandonment, when the foreshortening is carried so\r\nfar that one end of the stage represents one locality and the other\r\nend another at a distance (_Disobedient Child_, _Mary Magdalene_,\r\n_Endymion_, _Midas_, _Patient Grissell_). And it has been abandoned\r\naltogether, when the same background or a part of it is taken to\r\nrepresent different localities in different episodes, and ingenuity\r\nhas to be taxed to find means of informing the audience where any\r\nparticular bit of action is proceeding (_Gorboduc_, _Orestes_, _Clyomon\r\nand Clamydes_, _Common Conditions_).[117]\r\n\r\nAfter considering the classicist group of comedies and tragedies, I\r\nsuggested that these, taken by themselves, would point to a method of\r\nstaging at the Elizabethan Court not unlike that recommended by Serlio.\r\nThe more comprehensive survey now completed points to some revision\r\nof that judgement. Two localities at opposite ends of the stage could\r\nnot, obviously, be worked into a continuous architectural façade. They\r\ncall for something more on the lines of the multiple setting of the\r\nHôtel de Bourgogne, although the width of the Elizabethan palace halls\r\nmay perhaps have accommodated a longer stage than that of the Hôtel,\r\nand permitted of a less crude juxtaposition of the houses belonging to\r\ndistinct localities than Mahelot offers us. Any use of perspective, for\r\nwhich there is some Elizabethan evidence, was presumably within the\r\nlimits of one locality.[118]\r\n\r\nThe indications of the Revels Accounts, scanty as they are, are not\r\ninconsistent with those yielded by the plays.[119] If the _Orestes_\r\nof 1567–8, as may reasonably be supposed, was Pikeryng’s, his ‘howse’\r\nmust have been the common structure used successively for Mycenae,\r\nCrete, and Athens. The ‘Scotland and a gret Castell on thothere side’\r\ngive us the familiar arrangement for two localities. I think that the\r\n‘city’ of the later accounts may stand for a group of houses on one\r\nstreet or market-place, and a ‘mountain’ or ‘wood’ for a setting _tout\r\nen pastoralle_. There were tents for _A Game of the Cards_ in 1582–3,\r\nas in _Jacob and Esau_, a prison for _The Four Sons of Fabius_ in\r\n1579–80, as in several extant plays. I cannot parallel from any early\r\nsurvival the senate house for the _Quintus Fabius_ of 1573–4, but this\r\nbecame a common type of scene at a later date. These are recessed\r\nhouses, and curtains, quite distinct from the front curtain, if any,\r\nwere provided by the Revels officers to open and close them, as the\r\nneeds of the action required. Smaller structures, to which the accounts\r\nrefer, are also needed by the plays; a well by _Endymion_, a gibbet by\r\n_Orestes_, a tree by _The Arraignment of Paris_, and inferentially by\r\nall pastoral, and many other plays. The brief record of 1567–8 does not\r\nspecify the battlement or gated wall, solid enough for Clytemnestra\r\nto speak ‘ouer y^e wal’, which was a feature in the siege episode of\r\n_Orestes_. Presumably it was part of the ‘howse’, which is mentioned,\r\nand indeed it would by itself furnish sufficient background for the\r\nscenes alike at Mycenae, Crete, and Athens. If it stood alone, it\r\nprobably extended along the back of the stage, where it would interfere\r\nleast with the arrays of Orestes and of Aegisthus. But in the accounts\r\nof 1579–85, the plays, of which there are many, with battlements also,\r\nas a rule, have cities, and here we must suppose some situation for\r\nthe battlement which will not interfere with the city. If it stood for\r\nthe gate and wall of some other city, it may have been reared at an\r\nopposite end of the stage. In _Dido_, where the gate of Troy seems to\r\nhave been shown, although there is no action ‘ouer’ it, I can visualize\r\nit best as extending across the middle of the stage from back to\r\nfront. With an unchanging setting it need not always have occupied\r\nthe same place. The large number of plays between 1579 and 1585 which\r\nrequired battlements, no less than fourteen out of twenty-eight in all,\r\nis rather striking. No doubt the assault motive was beloved in the\r\npopular type of drama, of which _Orestes_ was an early representative.\r\nA castle in a wood, where a knight is imprisoned, is assaulted in\r\n_Clyomon and Clamydes_, and the Shakespearian stage never wearied of\r\nthe device. I have sometimes thought that with the Revels officers\r\n‘battlement’ was a technical term for any platform provided for action\r\nat a higher level than the floor of the stage. Certainly a battlement\r\nwas provided in 1585 for an entertainment which was not a play at all,\r\nbut a performance of feats of activities.[120] But as a matter of fact\r\nraised action, so common in the Shakespearian period, is extremely\r\nrare in these early plays. With the exceptions of Clytemnestra peering\r\nover her wall, and the descents from heaven in _Gismond of Salerne_\r\nand _Clyomon and Clamydes_, which may of course have been through\r\nthe roof rather than from a platform, the seventy or so plays just\r\ndiscussed contain nothing of the kind. There are, however, two plays\r\nstill to be mentioned, in which use is made of a platform, and one of\r\nthese gives some colour to my suggestion. In 1582 Derby’s men played\r\n_Love and Fortune_ at Court, and a city and a battlement, together with\r\nsome other structure of canvas, the name of which is left blank, were\r\nprovided. This may reasonably be identified with the _Rare Triumphs\r\nof Love and Fortune_, which claims on its title-page of 1589 to have\r\nbeen played before the Queen. It is a piece of the romantic type. The\r\naction is divided between a court and a cave in a wood, which account\r\nfor the city and the unnamed structure of the Revels record. They were\r\nevidently shown together, at opposite ends of the stage, for action\r\npasses directly from one to the other. There is no assault scene. But\r\nthere is an induction, in which the gods are in assembly, and Tisiphone\r\narises from hell. At the end of it Jupiter says to Venus and Fortune:\r\n\r\n    Take up your places here, to work your will,\r\n\r\nand Vulcan comments:\r\n\r\n    They are set sunning like a crow in a gutter.\r\n\r\nThey remain as spectators of the play until they ‘shew themselves’ and\r\nintervene in the _dénouement_. Evidently they are in a raised place\r\nor balcony. And this balcony must be the battlement. An exact analogy\r\nis furnished by the one of Lyly’s plays to which I have not as yet\r\nreferred. This is _The Woman in the Moon_, Lyly’s only verse play, and\r\npossibly of later date than his group of productions with the Paul’s\r\nboys. The first act has the character of an induction. Nature and the\r\nseven Planets are on the stage and ‘They draw the curtins from before\r\nNatures shop’. During the other four there is a human action in a\r\npastoral setting with a cave, beneath which is a trap, a grove on the\r\nbank of Enipeus, and a spot near the sea-shore. And throughout one or\r\nother of the Planets is watching the play from a ‘seate’ (II. 176; III.\r\ni. 1) above, between which and the stage they ‘ascend’ and ‘descend’\r\n(I. 138, 230; II. 174, 236; III. ii. 35; IV. 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XX\r\n\r\n              STAGING IN THE THEATRES: SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n            [For _Bibliographical Note_, _vide_ ch. xviii.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the groups of plays brought under review in the\r\nlast chapter, the main problem considered has been that of their\r\nadaptability to the conditions of a Court stage. In the present chapter\r\nthe point of view must be shifted to that of the common theatres.\r\nObviously no hard and fast line is to be drawn. There had been regular\r\npublic performances in London since the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign\r\nor earlier, and there is no reason to suppose that the adult companies\r\nat least did not draw upon the same repertory both for popular and for\r\nprivate representation. But there is not much profit in attempting\r\nto investigate the methods of staging in the inns, of which we know\r\nnothing more than that quasi-permanent structures of carpenter’s work\r\ncame in time to supplement the doors, windows, and galleries which\r\nsurrounded the yards; and so far as the published plays go, it is\r\nfairly apparent that, up to the date of the suppression of Paul’s, the\r\nCourt, or at any rate the private, interest was the dominating one. A\r\nturning-point may be discerned in 1576, at the establishment, on the\r\none hand of the Theatre and the Curtain, and on the other of Farrant’s\r\nhouse in the Blackfriars. It is not likely that the Blackfriars\r\ndid more than reproduce the conditions of a courtly hall. But the\r\ninvestment of capital in the Theatre and the Curtain was an incident\r\nin the history of the companies, the economic importance of which has\r\nalready been emphasized in an earlier discussion.[121] It was followed\r\nby the formation of strong theatrical organizations in the Queen’s men,\r\nthe Admiral’s, Strange’s, the Chamberlain’s. For a time the economic\r\nchanges are masked by the continued vogue of the boy companies; but\r\nwhen these dropped out at the beginning of the ’nineties, it is clear\r\nthat the English stage had become a public stage, and that the eyes of\r\nits controllers were fixed primarily upon the pence gathered by the\r\nbox-holders, and only secondarily upon the rewards of the Treasurer of\r\nthe Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe first play published ‘as it was publikely acted’ is the\r\n_Troublesome Raigne of John_ of 1591, and henceforward I think it\r\nis true to say that the staging suggested by the public texts and\r\ntheir directions in the main represents the arrangements of the\r\npublic theatres. There is no sudden breach of continuity with the\r\nearlier period, but that continuity is far greater with the small\r\ngroup of popular plays typified by _Clyomon and Clamydes_ and _Common\r\nConditions_, than with anything which Lyly and his friends produced\r\nat Paul’s or the Blackfriars. Again it is necessary to beware of\r\nany exaggeration of antithesis. There is one Chapel play, _The Wars\r\nof Cyrus_, the date of which is obscure, and the setting of which\r\ncertainly falls on the theatre rather than the Court side of any\r\nborder-line. On the other hand, the Queen’s men and their successors\r\ncontinued to serve the Court, and one of the published Queen’s plays,\r\n_The Old Wive’s Tale_, was evidently staged in a way exactly analogous\r\nto that adopted by Lyly, or by Peele himself in _The Arraignment of\r\nParis_. It is _tout en pastoralle_, and about the stage are dispersed a\r\nhut with a door, at the threshold of which presenters sit to watch the\r\nmain action (71, 128, 1163), a little hill or mound with a practicable\r\nturf (512, 734, 1034), a cross (173, 521), a ‘well of life’ (743,\r\n773), an inn before which a table is set (904, 916), and a ‘cell’ or\r\n‘studie’ for the conjurer, before which ‘he draweth a curten’ (411,\r\n773, 1060).[122] Of one other play by Peele it is difficult to take\r\nany account in estimating evidence as to staging. This is _David and\r\nBethsabe_, of which the extant text apparently represents an attempt to\r\nbring within the compass of a single performance a piece or fragments\r\nof a piece originally written in three ‘discourses’. I mention it here,\r\nbecause somewhat undue use has been made of its opening direction in\r\nspeculations as to the configuration of the back wall of the public\r\nstage.[123] It uses the favourite assault motive, and has many changes\r\nof locality. The title-page suggests that in its present form it was\r\nmeant for public performance. But almost anything may lie behind that\r\npresent form, possibly a Chapel play, possibly a University play, or\r\neven a neo-miracle in the tradition of Bale; and the staging of any\r\nparticular scene may contain original elements, imperfectly adapted to\r\nlater conditions.\r\n\r\nCounting in _The Wars of Cyrus_ then, and counting out _The Old Wive’s\r\nTale_ and _David and Bethsabe_, there are about seventy-four plays\r\nwhich may reasonably be taken to have been presented upon common\r\nstages, between the establishment of the Queen’s men in 1583 and the\r\nbuilding of the Globe for the Chamberlain’s men in 1599 and of the\r\nFortune for the Admiral’s men in 1600. With a few exceptions they were\r\nalso published during the same period, and the scenic arrangements\r\nimplied by their texts and stage-directions may therefore be looked\r\nupon as those of the sixteenth-century theatres. These form the\r\nnext group for our consideration. Of the seventy-four plays, the\r\noriginal production of nine may with certainty or fair probability be\r\nassigned to the Queen’s men, of two to Sussex’s, five to Pembroke’s,\r\nfourteen to Strange’s or the Admiral’s or the two in combination,\r\nthirteen to the Admiral’s after the combination broke up, seventeen\r\nto the Chamberlain’s, three to Derby’s, one to Oxford’s, and one to\r\nthe Chapel; nine must remained unassigned.[124] It is far less easy\r\nto make a guess at the individual theatre whose staging each play\r\nrepresents. The migrations of the companies before 1594 in the main\r\nelude us. Thereafter the Admiral’s were settled at the Rose until 1600.\r\nThe Chamberlain’s may have passed from the Theatre to the Curtain\r\nabout 1597. The habitations of the other later companies are very\r\nconjectural. Moreover, plays were carried from theatre to theatre,\r\nand even transferred from company to company. _Titus Andronicus_,\r\nsuccessively presented by Pembroke’s, Strange’s, Sussex’s, and the\r\nChamberlain’s, is an extreme case in point. The ideal method would have\r\nbeen to study the staging of each theatre separately, before coming to\r\nany conclusion as to the similarity or diversity of their arrangements.\r\nThis is impracticable, and I propose therefore to proceed on the\r\nassumption that the stages of the Theatre, the Curtain, and the Rose\r\nwere in their main features similar. For this there is an _a priori_\r\nargument in the convenience of what Mr. Archer calls a ‘standardisation\r\nof effects’, especially at a time when the bonds between companies and\r\ntheatres were so loose.[125] Moreover, the Theatre and the Curtain\r\nwere built at much the same date, and although there was room for\r\ndevelopment in the art of theatrical architecture before the addition\r\nof the Rose, I am unable, after a careful examination of the relevant\r\nplays, to lay my finger upon any definite new feature which Henslowe\r\ncan be supposed to have introduced. It is exceedingly provoking that\r\nthe sixteenth-century repertory of the Swan has yielded nothing which\r\ncan serve as a _point de liaison_ between De Witt’s drawing and the\r\nmass of extant texts.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to begin with some analysis of the various types of\r\nscene which the sixteenth-century managers were called upon to produce;\r\nand these may with advantage be arranged according to the degree of\r\nuse which they make of a structural background.[126] There are, of\r\ncourse, a certain number of scenes which make no use of a background\r\nat all, and may in a sense be called unlocated scenes--mere bits of\r\nconversation which might be carried on between the speakers wherever\r\nthey happened to meet, and which give no indication of where that\r\nmeeting is supposed to be. Perhaps these scenes are not so numerous as\r\nis sometimes suggested.[127] At any rate it must be borne in mind that\r\nthey were located to the audience, who saw them against a background,\r\nalthough, if they were kept well to the front or side of the stage,\r\ntheir relation to that background would be minimized.\r\n\r\nA great many scenes are in what may be called open country--in a\r\nroad, a meadow, a grove, a forest, a desert, a mountain, a sea-shore.\r\nThe personages are travelling, or hunting, or in outlawry, or merely\r\ntaking the air. The background does not generally include a house in\r\nthe stricter sense; but there may be a cottage,[128] a hermit’s or\r\nfriar’s cell,[129] a rustic bower,[130] a cave,[131] a beacon.[132]\r\nEven where there is no evidence, in dialogue or stage-directions,\r\nfor a dwelling, a table or board may be suddenly forthcoming for a\r\nbanquet.[133] There may be a fountain or well,[134] and a few scenes\r\nseem to imply the presence of a river.[135] But often there is no\r\nsuggestion of any surroundings but rocks or trees, and the references\r\nto the landscape, which are frequently put in the mouths of speakers,\r\nhave been interpreted as intended to stimulate the imagination of\r\nspectators before whose eyes no representation, or a very imperfect\r\nrepresentation, of wilderness or woodland had been placed.[136] But\r\nit is not likely that this literary artifice was alone relied upon,\r\nand in some cases practicable trees or rocks are certainly required\r\nby the action and must have been represented.[137] There are plays\r\nwhich are set continuously in the open country throughout, or during a\r\nsuccession of scenes, and are thus analogous to Court plays _tout en\r\npastoralle_. But there are others in which the open-country scenes are\r\nonly interspersed among scenes of a different type.[138]\r\n\r\nNothing was more beloved by a popular audience, especially in an\r\nhistorical play or one of the _Tamburlaine_ order, than an episode\r\nof war. A war scene was often only a variety of the open-country scene.\r\nArmies come and go on the road, and a battle naturally takes place in\r\nmore or less open ground. It may be in a wood, or a tree or river may\r\nbe introduced.[139] Obviously large forces could not be shown on the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n                      We shall much disgrace,\r\n    With four or five most vile and ragged foils,\r\n    Right ill disposed in brawl ridiculous,\r\n    The name of Agincourt.[140]\r\n\r\nThe actual fighting tended to be sketchy and symbolical. There were\r\nalarums and excursions, much beating of drums and blowing of trumpets.\r\nBut the stage was often only on the outskirts of the main battle.[141]\r\nIt served for a duel of protagonists, or for a flight and pursuit of\r\nstragglers; and when all was over a triumphant train marched across it.\r\nThere may be a succession of ‘excursions’ of this kind, in which the\r\nstage may be supposed, if you like, to stand for different parts of a\r\nbattle-field.[142] Battle scenes have little need for background; the\r\ninn at St. Albans in _Henry VI_ is an exception due to the fulfilment\r\nof an oracular prophecy.[143] A more natural indication of _milieu_ is\r\na tent, and battle scenes merge into camp scenes, in which the tents\r\nare sometimes elaborate pavilions, with doors and even locks to the\r\ndoors. Seats and tables may be available, and the action is clearly\r\nsometimes within an opened tent.[144] Two opposing camps can be\r\nconcurrently represented, and action may alternate between them.[145]\r\nAnother kind of background is furnished, as in _Orestes_, by the walls\r\nof a besieged city. On these walls the defenders can appear and parley\r\nwith the besieging host. They can descend and open the gates.[146] They\r\ncan shoot, and be shot at from below.[147] The walls can be taken by\r\nassault and the defenders can leap from them.[148] Such scenes had an\r\nunfailing appeal, and are sometimes repeated, before different cities,\r\nin the same play.[149]\r\n\r\nSeveral scenes, analogous in some ways to those in the open country,\r\nare set in a garden, an orchard, a park. These also sometimes utilize\r\ntents.[150] Alternative shelter may be afforded by an arbour or bower,\r\nwhich facilitates eavesdropping.[151] The presence of trees, banks, or\r\nherbs is often required or suggested.[152] As a rule, the neighbourhood\r\nof a dwelling is implied, and from this personages may issue, or may\r\nhold discourse with those outside. Juliet’s balcony, overlooking\r\nCapulet’s orchard, is a typical instance.[153] A banquet may be brought\r\nout and served in the open.[154]\r\n\r\nThe next great group of scenes consists of those which pass in some\r\npublic spot in a city--in a street, a market-place, or a churchyard.\r\nEspecially if the play is located in or near London, this may be\r\na definite and familiar spot--Cheapside, Lombard Street, Paul’s\r\nChurchyard, Westminster.[155] Often the action is self-sufficient and\r\nthe background merely suggestive or decorative. A procession passes;\r\na watch is set; friends meet and converse; a stranger asks his way.\r\nBut sometimes a structure comes into use. There is a scaffold for an\r\nexecution.[156] Lists are set, and there must be at least a raised\r\nplace for the judge, and probably a barrier.[157] One street scene\r\nin _Soliman and Perseda_ is outside a tiltyard; another close to an\r\naccessible tower.[158] Bills may be set up.[159] In _Lord Cromwell_\r\nthis is apparently done on a bridge, and twice in this play it is\r\ndifficult to resist the conclusion, already pointed to in certain\r\nopen-country scenes, that some kind of representation of a river-side\r\nwas feasible.[160] In Rome there are scenes in which the dialogue is\r\npartly amongst senators in the capitol and partly amongst citizens\r\nwithin ear-shot outside.[161] A street may provide a corner, again,\r\nwhence passers-by can be overheard or waylaid.[162] And in it, just\r\nas well as in a garden, a lover may hold an assignation, or bring a\r\nserenade before the window of his mistress.[163] A churchyard, or in\r\na Roman play a market-place, may hold a tomb.[164] Finally one or more\r\nshops may be visible, and action may take place within them as well as\r\nbefore them.[165] Such a shop would, of course, be nothing more than a\r\nshallow stall, with an open front for the display of wares, which may\r\nbe closed by a shutter or flap from above.[166] It may also, like the\r\ninn in _Henry VI_, have a sign.[167]\r\n\r\nWhere there is a window, there can of course be a door, and street\r\nscenes very readily become threshold scenes. I do not think that it\r\nhas been fully realized how large a proportion of the action of\r\nElizabethan plays passes at the doors of houses; and as a result\r\nthe problem of staging, difficult enough anyhow, has been rendered\r\nunnecessarily difficult. Here we have probably to thank the editors\r\nof plays, who have freely interspersed their texts with notes of\r\nlocality, which are not in the original stage-directions, and, with\r\neighteenth-century models before them, have tended to assume that\r\naction at a house is action in some room within that house. The\r\nplaywrights, on the other hand, followed the neo-classic Italian\r\ntradition, and for them action at a house was most naturally action\r\nbefore the door of that house. If a man visited his friend he was\r\nalmost certain to meet him on the doorstep; and here domestic\r\ndiscussions, even on matters of delicacy, commonly took place. Here\r\ntoo, of course, meals might be served.[168] A clue to this convention\r\nis afforded by the numerous passages in which a servant or other\r\npersonage is brought on to the stage by a ‘Who’s within?’ or a call\r\nto ‘Come forth!’ or in which an episode is wound up by some such\r\ninvitation as ‘Let us in!’ No doubt such phrases remain appropriate\r\nwhen it is merely a question of transference between an outer room\r\nand an inner; and no doubt also the point of view of the personages\r\nis sometimes deflected by that of the actors, to whom ‘in’ means ‘in\r\nthe tiring-room’ and ‘out’ means ‘on the stage’.[169] But, broadly\r\nspeaking, the frequency of their use points to a corresponding\r\nfrequency of threshold scenes; and, where there is a doubt, they\r\nshould, I think, be interpreted in the light of that economy of\r\ninterior action which was very evident in the mid-sixteenth-century\r\nplays, and in my opinion continued to prevail after the opening\r\nof the theatres. The use of a house door was so frequent that the\r\nstage-directions do not, as a rule, trouble to specify it.[170] Two\r\ncomplications are, however, to be observed. Sometimes, in a scene\r\nwhich employs the ‘Let us in!’ formula, or on other ground looks like\r\na threshold scene, we are suddenly pulled up either by a suggestion\r\nof the host that we are ‘in’ his house or under his roof, or by an\r\nindication that persons outside are to be brought ‘in’.[171] The first\r\nanswer is, I think, that the threshold is not always a mere doorstep\r\nopening from the street; it may be something of the nature of a porch\r\nor even a lobby, and that you may fairly be said to be under a man’s\r\nroof when you are in his porch.[172] The second is that in some\r\nthreshold scenes the stage was certainly regarded as representing a\r\ncourtyard, shut off from the street or road by an outer gate, through\r\nwhich strangers could quite properly be supposed to come ‘in’.[173]\r\nSuch courtyard scenes are not out of place, even before an ordinary\r\nprivate house; still less, of course, when the house is a castle, and\r\nin a castle courtyard scene we get very near the scenes with ‘walls’\r\nalready described.[174] Some prison scenes, in the Tower or elsewhere,\r\nare apparently of this type, although others seem to require interior\r\naction in a close chamber or even a dungeon.[175] Threshold scenes may\r\nalso be before the outer gate of a palace or castle, where another\r\nanalogy to assault scenes presents itself;[176] or before a church or\r\ntemple, a friar’s cell, an inn, a stable, or the like.[177] Nor are\r\nshop scenes, since a shop may be a mere adjunct to a house, really\r\ndifferent in kind.\r\n\r\nThe threshold theory must not be pushed to a disregard of the clear\r\nevidence for a certain amount of interior action. We have already come\r\nacross examples of shallow recesses, such as a tent, a cave, a bower, a\r\ntomb, a shop, a window, within which, or from within which, personages\r\ncan speak. There are also scenes which must be supposed to take\r\nplace within a room. In dealing with these, I propose to distinguish\r\nbetween spacious hall scenes and limited chamber scenes. Hall scenes\r\nare especially appropriate to palaces. Full value should no doubt be\r\ngiven to the extension in a palace of a porch to a portico, and to the\r\nconvention, which kings as well as private men follow in Elizabethan\r\nplays, especially those located in Italian or Oriental surroundings, of\r\ntransacting much important business more or less out-of-doors.[178] The\r\ncharacteristic Roman ‘senate house’, already described, is a case in\r\npoint.[179] But some scenes must be in a closed presence-chamber.[180]\r\nOthers are in a formal council room or parliament house. The conception\r\nof a hall, often with a numerous company, cannot therefore be\r\naltogether excluded. Nor are halls confined to palaces. They must be\r\nassumed for law courts.[181] There are scenes in such buildings as the\r\nLondon Exchange, Leadenhall, the Regent House at Oxford.[182] There\r\nare scenes in churches or heathen temples and in monasteries.[183]\r\nThere are certainly also hall scenes in castles or private houses,\r\nand it is sometimes a matter of taste whether you assume a hall scene\r\nor a threshold scene.[184] Certain features of hall scenes may be\r\nenumerated. Personages can go into, or come forth from, an inner room.\r\nThey can be brought in from without.[185] Seats are available, and\r\na chair or ‘state’ for a sovereign.[186] A law court has its ‘bar’.\r\nBanquets can be served.[187] Masks may come dancing in.[188] Even a\r\nplay ‘within a play’ can be presented; that of Bottom and his fellows\r\nin ‘the great chamber’ of Theseus’ palace is an example.[189]\r\n\r\nMy final group is formed by the chamber scenes, in which the action\r\nis clearly regarded as within the limits of an ordinary room. They\r\nare far from numerous, in proportion to the total number of scenes in\r\nthe seventy-three plays, and in view of their importance in relation\r\nto staging all for which there is clear evidence must be put upon\r\nrecord. Most of them fall under two or three sub-types, which tend to\r\nrepeat themselves. The commonest are perhaps bedchamber scenes.[190]\r\nThese, like prison scenes, which are also frequent, give opportunity\r\nfor tragic episodes of death and sickness.[191] There are scenes\r\nin living-rooms, often called ‘studies’.[192] A lady’s bower,[193]\r\na counting-house,[194] an inn parlour,[195] a buttery,[196] a\r\ngallery,[197] may also be represented.\r\n\r\nThis then is the practical problem, which the manager of an\r\nElizabethan theatre had to solve--the provision of settings, not\r\nnecessarily so elaborate or decorative as those of the Court, but\r\nat least intelligible, for open country scenes, battle and siege\r\nscenes, garden scenes, street and threshold scenes, hall scenes,\r\nchamber scenes. Like the Master of the Revels, he made far less use\r\nof interior action than the modern or even the Restoration producer\r\nof plays; but he could not altogether avoid it, either on the larger\r\nscale of a hall scene, in which a considerable number of persons had\r\noccasionally to be staged for a parliament or a council or the like,\r\nor on the smaller scale when only a few persons had to be shown in\r\na chamber, or in the still shallower enclosure which might stand as\r\npart of a mainly out-of-doors setting for a cell, a bower, a cave, a\r\ntent, a senate house, a window, a tomb, a shop, a porch, a shrine, a\r\nniche.[198] Even more than the Master of the Revels, he had to face\r\nthe complication due to the taste of an English audience for romantic\r\nor historical drama, and the changes of locality which a narrative\r\ntheme inevitably involved. Not for him, except here and there in a\r\ncomedy, that blessed unity of place upon which the whole dramatic art\r\nof the Italian neo-classic school had been built up. Our corresponding\r\nantiquarian problem is to reconstruct, so far as the evidence permits,\r\nthe structural resources which were at the Elizabethan manager’s\r\ndisposal for the accomplishment of his task. As material we have the\r\nnumerous indications in dialogue and stage-directions with which the\r\nfootnotes to this chapter are groaning; we have such contemporary\r\nallusions as those of Dekker’s _Gull’s Hornbook_; we have the débris of\r\nPhilip Henslowe’s business memoranda; we have the tradition inherited\r\nfrom the earlier Elizabethan period, for all the types of scene usual\r\nin the theatres had already made their appearance before the theatres\r\ncame into existence; to a much less degree, owing to the interposition\r\nof the roofed and rectangular Caroline theatre, we have also the\r\ntradition bequeathed to the Restoration; and as almost sole graphic\r\npresentment we have that drawing of the Swan theatre by Johannes de\r\nWitt, which has already claimed a good deal of our consideration, and\r\nto which we shall have to return from time to time, as a _point de\r\nrepère_, in the course of the forthcoming discussion. It is peculiarly\r\nunfortunate that of all the seventy-three plays, now under review,\r\nnot one can be shown to have been performed at the Swan, and that the\r\nonly relics of the productions at that house, the plot of _England’s\r\nJoy_ of 1602 and Middleton’s _Chaste Maid in Cheapside_ of 1611, stand\r\nat such a distance of time from DeWitt’s drawing as not to exclude\r\nthe hypothesis of an intermediate reconstruction of its stage. One\r\nother source of information, which throws a sidelight or two upon the\r\nquestions at issue, I will here deal with at more length, because it\r\nhas been a good deal overlooked. The so-called ‘English Wagner Book’\r\nof 1594, which contains the adventures of Wagner after the death of\r\nhis master Faustus, although based upon a German original, is largely\r\nan independent work by an author who shows more than one sign of\r\nfamiliarity with the English theatre.[199] The most important of these\r\nis in chapter viii, which is headed ‘The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus\r\nseene in the Ayre, and acted in the presence of a thousand people of\r\nWittenberg. An. 1540’. It describes, not an actual performance, but an\r\naerial vision produced by Wagner’s magic arts for the bewilderment of\r\nan imperial pursuivant. The architecture has therefore, no doubt, its\r\nelements of fantasy. Nevertheless, it is our nearest approach to a pen\r\npicture of an Elizabethan stage, whereby to eke out that of De Witt’s\r\npencil.\r\n\r\n   ‘They might distinctly perceiue a goodlye Stage to be reard\r\n   (shining to sight like the bright burnish golde) uppon many a\r\n   faire Pillar of clearest Cristall, whose feete rested uppon the\r\n   Arch of the broad Raynebow, therein was the high Throne wherein\r\n   the King should sit, and that prowdly placed with two and twenty\r\n   degrees to the top, and round about curious wrought chaires for\r\n   diverse other Potentates, there might you see the ground-worke\r\n   at the one end of the Stage whereout the personated divels\r\n   should enter in their fiery ornaments, made like the broad wide\r\n   mouth of an huge Dragon ... the teeth of this Hels-mouth far\r\n   out stretching.... At the other end in opposition was seene the\r\n   place where in the bloudlesse skirmishes are so often perfourmed\r\n   on the Stage, the Wals ... of ... Iron attempered with the most\r\n   firme steele ... environed with high and stately Turrets of the\r\n   like metall and beautye, and hereat many in-gates and out-gates:\r\n   out of each side lay the bended Ordinaunces, showing at their\r\n   wide hollowes the crueltye of death: out of sundry loopes many\r\n   large Banners and Streamers were pendant, brieflye nothing was\r\n   there wanting that might make it a faire Castle. There might\r\n   you see to be short the Gibbet, the Posts, the Ladders, the\r\n   tiring-house, there everything which in the like houses either\r\n   use or necessity makes common. Now above all was there the gay\r\n   Clowdes _Vsque quaque_ adorned with the heavenly firmament, and\r\n   often spotted with golden teares which men callen Stars. There\r\n   was lively portrayed the whole Imperiall Army of the faire\r\n   heavenly inhabitaunts.... This excellent faire Theator erected,\r\n   immediatly after the third sound of the Trumpets, there entreth\r\n   in the Prologue attired in a blacke vesture, and making his\r\n   three obeysances, began to shew the argument of that Scenicall\r\n   Tragedy, but because it was so far off they could not understand\r\n   the wordes, and having thrice bowed himselfe to the high Throne,\r\n   presently vanished.’\r\n\r\nThe action of the play is then described. Devils issue from hell mouth\r\nand besiege the castle. Faustus appears on the battlements and defies\r\nthem. Angels descend from heaven to the tower and are dismissed by\r\nFaustus. The devils assault the castle, capture Faustus and raze the\r\ntower. The great devil and all the imperial rulers of hell occupy the\r\nthrone and chairs and dispute with Faustus. Finally,\r\n\r\n   ‘Faustus ... leapt down headlong of the stage, the whole company\r\n   immediatly vanishing, but the stage with a most monstrous\r\n   thundering crack followed Faustus hastely, the people verily\r\n   thinking that they would have fallen uppon them ran all away.’\r\n\r\nThe three salient features of the Swan stage, as depicted by De Witt,\r\nare, firstly the two pairs of folding doors in the back wall; secondly,\r\nthe ‘heavens’ supported on posts, which give the effect of a division\r\nof the space into a covered rear and an uncovered front; and thirdly,\r\nthe gallery or row of boxes, which occupies the upper part of the back\r\nwall. Each of these lends itself to a good deal of comment. The two\r\ndoors find abundant confirmation from numerous stage-directions, which\r\nlead up to the favourite dramatic device of bringing in personages from\r\ndifferent points to meet in the centre of the stage. The formula which\r\nagrees most closely with the drawing is that which directs entrance\r\n‘at one door’ and ‘at the other door’, and is of very common use.[200]\r\nBut there are a great many variants, which are used, as for example\r\nin the plot of _2 Seven Deadly Sins_, with such indifference as to\r\nsuggest that no variation of structure is necessarily involved.[201]\r\nThus an equally common antithesis is that between ‘one door’ and, not\r\n‘the other door’, but ‘an other door’.[202] Other analogous expressions\r\nare ‘one way’ and ‘at an other door’, ‘one way’ and ‘another way’,\r\n‘at two sundry doors’, ‘at diverse doors’, ‘two ways’, ‘met by’;[203]\r\nor again, ‘at several doors’, ‘several ways’, ‘severally’.[204] There\r\nis a divergence, however, from De Witt’s indications, when we come\r\nupon terminology which suggests that more than two doors may have\r\nbeen available for entrances, a possibility with which the references\r\nto ‘one door’ and ‘an other’ are themselves not inconsistent. Thus\r\nin one of the _2 Seven Deadly Sins_ variants, after other personages\r\nhave entered ‘seuerall waies’, we find ‘Gorboduk entreing in the midst\r\nbetween’. There are other examples of triple entrance in _Fair Em_,\r\nin _Patient Grissell_, and in _The Trial of Chivalry_, although it\r\nis not until the seventeenth century that three doors are in so many\r\nwords enumerated.[205] We get entrance ‘at every door’, however, in\r\n_The Downfall of Robin Hood_, and this, with other more disputable\r\nphrases, might perhaps be pressed into an argument that even three\r\npoints of entrance did not exhaust the limits of practicability.[206]\r\nIt should be added that, while doors are most commonly indicated as the\r\navenue of entrance, this is not always the case. Sometimes personages\r\nare said to enter from one or other ‘end’, or ‘side’, or ‘part’ of\r\nthe stage.[207] I take it that the three terms have the same meaning,\r\nand that the ‘end’ of a stage wider than its depth is what we should\r\ncall its ‘side’. A few minor points about doors may be noted, and\r\nthe discussion of a difficulty may be deferred.[208] Some entrances\r\nwere of considerable size; an animal could be ridden on and off.[209]\r\nThere were practicable and fairly solid doors; in _A Knack to Know an\r\nHonest Man_, a door is taken off its hinges.[210] And as the doors give\r\nadmittance indifferently to hall scenes and to out-of-door scenes,\r\nit is obvious that the term, as used in the stage-directions, often\r\nindicates a part of the theatrical structure rather than a feature\r\nproperly belonging to a garden or woodland background.[211]\r\n\r\nSome observations upon the heavens have already been made in an earlier\r\nchapter.[212] I feel little doubt that, while the supporting posts\r\nhad primarily a structural object, and probably formed some obstacle\r\nto the free vision of the spectators, they were occasionally worked\r\nby the ingenuity of the dramatists and actors into the ‘business’ of\r\nthe plays. The hints for such business are not very numerous, but they\r\nare sufficient to confirm the view that the Swan was not the only\r\nsixteenth-century theatre in which the posts existed. Thus in a street\r\nscene of _Englishmen for my Money_ and in an open country scene of _Two\r\nAngry Women of Abingdon_ we get episodes in which personages groping\r\nin the darkness stumble up against posts, and the second of these is\r\nparticularly illuminating, because the victim utters a malediction\r\nupon the carpenter who set the post up, which a carpenter may have\r\ndone upon the stage, but certainly did not do in a coney burrow.[213]\r\nIn _Englishmen for my Money_ the posts are taken for maypoles, and\r\nthere are two of them. There are two of them also in _Three Lords\r\nand Three Ladies of London_, a post and ‘the contrarie post’, and\r\nto one of them a character is bound, just as Kempe tells us that\r\npickpockets taken in a theatre were bound.[214] The binding to a post\r\noccurs also in _Soliman and Perseda_.[215] In _James IV_ and in _Lord\r\nCromwell_ bills are set up on the stage, and for this purpose the posts\r\nwould conveniently serve.[216] All these are out-of-door scenes, but\r\nthere was a post in the middle of a warehouse in _Every Man In his\r\nHumour_, and Miles sits down by a post during one of the scenes in the\r\nconjurer’s cell in _Bacon and Bungay_.[217] I am not oblivious of the\r\nfact that there were doubtless other structural posts on the stage\r\nbesides those of the heavens, but I do not see how they can have been\r\nso conspicuous or so well adapted to serve in the action.[218] Posts\r\nmay have supported the gallery, but I find it difficult to visualize\r\nthe back of the stage without supposing these to have been veiled by\r\nthe hangings. But two of them may have become visible when the hangings\r\nwere drawn, or some porch-like projection from the back wall may have\r\nhad its posts, and one of these may be in question, at any rate in the\r\nindoor scenes.\r\n\r\nThe roof of the heavens was presumably used to facilitate certain\r\nspectacular effects, the tradition of which the public theatres\r\ninherited from the miracle-plays and the Court stage.[219] Startling\r\natmospheric phenomena were not infrequently represented.[220] These\r\ncame most naturally in out-of-door scenes, but I have noted one example\r\nin a scene which on general grounds one would classify as a hall\r\nscene.[221] The illusion may not have gone much beyond a painted cloth\r\ndrawn under the roof of the heavens.[222] More elaborate machinery may\r\nhave been entailed by aerial ascents and descents, which were also\r\nnot uncommon. Many Elizabethan actors were half acrobats, and could\r\nno doubt fly upon a wire; but there is also clear evidence for the\r\nuse of a chair let down from above.[223] And was the arrangement of\r\ncords and pulleys required for this purpose also that by which the\r\nchair of state, which figures in so many hall scenes and even a few\r\nout-of-door scenes, was put into position?[224] Henslowe had a throne\r\nmade in the heavens of the Rose in 1595.[225] Jonson sneered at the\r\njubilation of boyhood over the descent of the creaking chair.[226] The\r\ndevice would lighten the labours of the tire-man, for a state would be\r\nan awkward thing to carry on and off. It would avoid the presence of\r\na large incongruous property on the stage during action to which it\r\nwas inappropriate. And it would often serve as a convenient signal\r\nfor the beginning or ending of a hall scene. But to this aspect of the\r\nmatter I must return.[227] Whatever the machinery, it must have been\r\nworked in some way from the upper part of the tire-house; possibly from\r\nthe somewhat obscure third floor, which De Witt’s drawing leaves to\r\nconjecture; possibly from the superstructure known as the hut, if that\r\nreally stood further forward than De Witt’s drawing suggests. Perhaps\r\nthe late reference to Jove leaning on his elbows in the garret, or\r\nemployed to make squibs and crackers to grace the play, rather points\r\nto the former hypothesis.[228] In favour of the latter, for what it\r\nis worth, is the description, also late, of a theatre set up by the\r\nEnglish actors under John Spencer at Regensburg in 1613. This had a\r\nlower stage for music, over that a main stage thirty feet high with a\r\nroof supported by six great pillars, and under the roof a quadrangular\r\naperture, through which beautiful effects were contrived.[229]\r\n\r\nThere has been a general abandonment of the hypothesis, which found\r\nfavour when De Witt’s drawing was first discovered, of a division of\r\nthe stage into an inner and an outer part by a ‘traverse’ curtain\r\nrunning between the two posts, perhaps supplemented by two other\r\ncurtains running from the posts back to the tire-house.[230] Certainly\r\nI do not wish to revive it. Any such arrangement would be inconsistent\r\nwith the use of the tire-house doors and gallery in out-of-door scenes;\r\nfor, on the hypothesis, these were played with the traverse closed. And\r\nit would entail a serious interference with the vision of such scenes\r\nby spectators sitting far round in the galleries or ‘above the stage’.\r\nIt does not, of course, follow that no use at all was made of curtains\r\nupon the stage. It is true that no hangings of any kind are shown by\r\nDe Witt. Either there were none visible when he drew the Swan in 1596,\r\nor, if they were visible, he failed to draw them; it is impossible to\r\nsay which. We know that even the Swan was not altogether undraped in\r\n1602, for during the riot which followed the ‘cousening prancke’ of\r\n_England’s Joy_ in that year the audience are said to have ‘revenged\r\nthemselves upon the hangings, curtains, chairs, stooles, walles,\r\nand whatsoever came in their way’.[231] It is not, indeed, stated\r\nthat these hangings and curtains were upon the stage, and possibly,\r\nalthough not very probably, they may have been in the auditorium.\r\nApart, however, from the Swan, there is abundant evidence for the use\r\nof some kind of stage hangings in the public theatres of the sixteenth\r\ncentury generally. To the references in dialogue and stage-directions\r\nquoted in the footnotes to this chapter may be added the testimony\r\nof Florio in 1598, of Ben Jonson in 1601, of Heywood in 1608, and of\r\nFlecknoe after the Restoration.[232] We can go further, and point to\r\nseveral passages which attest a well-defined practice, clearly going\r\nback to the sixteenth century, of using black hangings for the special\r\npurpose of providing an appropriate setting for a tragedy.[233] Where\r\nthen were these hangings? For a front curtain, on the public stage,\r\nas distinct from the Court stage, there is no evidence whatever, and\r\nthe precautions taken to remove dead bodies in the course of action\r\nenable us quite safely to leave it out of account.[234] There may have\r\nbeen hangings of a decorative kind in various places, of course; round\r\nthe base of the stage, for example, or dependent, as Malone thought,\r\nfrom the heavens. But the only place where we can be sure that there\r\nwere hangings was what Heywood calls the ‘fore-front’ of the stage,\r\nby which it seems clear from Florio that he means the fore-front of\r\nthe tiring-house, which was at the same time the back wall of the\r\nstage. It is, I believe, exclusively to hangings in this region that\r\nour stage-directions refer. Their terminology is not quite uniform.\r\n‘Traverse’ I do not find in a sixteenth-century public play.[235] By\r\nfar the most common term is ‘curtain’, but I do not think that there\r\nis any technical difference between ‘curtain’ and the not infrequent\r\n‘arras’ or the unique ‘veil’ of _The Death of Robin Hood_.[236] ‘Arras’\r\nis the ordinary Elizabethan name for a hanging of tapestry used as\r\na wall decoration, and often projected from a frame so as to leave\r\na narrow space, valuable to eavesdroppers and other persons in need\r\nof seclusion, between itself and the wall. The stage arras serves\r\nprecisely this purpose as a background to interior scenes. Here stand\r\nthe murderers in _King John_; here Falstaff goes to sleep in _1 Henry\r\nIV_; and here too he proposes to ‘ensconce’ himself, in order to\r\navoid being confronted with both his ladyloves together in _The Merry\r\nWives_.[237]\r\n\r\nThe stage-directions, however, make it quite clear that the curtains\r\nwere not merely an immovable decoration of the back wall. They could\r\nbe ‘opened’ and ‘shut’ or ‘closed’; and either operation could\r\nindifferently be expressed by the term ‘drawn’. This drawing was\r\npresumably effected by sliding the curtain laterally along a straight\r\nrod to which it was affixed by rings sewn on to its upper edge;\r\nthere is no sign of any rise or fall of the curtain. The operator\r\nmay be an actor upon the stage; in _Bacon and Bungay_ Friar Bacon\r\ndraws the curtains ‘with a white sticke’. He may be the speaker of\r\na prologue.[238] Whether the ‘servitours’ of a theatre ever came\r\nupon the stage, undisguised, to draw the curtains, I am uncertain;\r\nbut obviously it would be quite easy to work the transformation from\r\nbehind, by a cord and pulley, without any visible intervention.[239]\r\nThe object of the drawing is to introduce interior action, either in\r\na mere recess, or in a larger space, such as a chamber; and this, not\r\nonly where curtains are dramatically appropriate, as within a house,\r\nor at the door of a tent, but also where they are less so, as before a\r\ncave or a forest bower. One may further accept the term ‘discovered’\r\nas indicating the unveiling of an interior by the play of a curtain,\r\neven when the curtain is not specifically mentioned;[240] and may\r\nrecognize that the stage-directions sometimes use ‘Enter’ and ‘Exit’\r\nin a loose sense of persons, who do not actually move in or out, but\r\nare ‘discovered’, or covered, by a curtain.[241]\r\n\r\nOf what nature, then, was the space so disclosed? There was ordinarily,\r\nas already stated, a narrow space behind an arras; and if the gallery\r\nabove the stage jutted forward, or had, as the Swan drawing perhaps\r\nindicates, a projecting weather-board, this might be widened into a\r\nsix- or seven-foot corridor, still in front of the back wall.[242]\r\nSuch a corridor would, however, hardly give the effect of a chamber,\r\nalthough it might that of a portico. Nor would it be adequate in\r\nsize to hold all the scenes which it is natural to class as chamber\r\nscenes; such, for example, as that in _Tamburlaine_, where no less than\r\nten persons are discovered grouped around Zenocrate’s bed.[243] The\r\nstage-directions themselves do not help us much; that in _Alphonsus_\r\nalone names ‘the place behind the stage’, and as this is only required\r\nto contain the head of Mahomet, a corridor, in this particular scene,\r\nwould have sufficed.[244] There is, however, no reason why the opening\r\ncurtains should not have revealed a quite considerable aperture in the\r\nback wall, and an alcove or recess of quite considerable size lying\r\nbehind this aperture. With a 43-foot stage, as at the Fortune, and\r\ndoors placed rather nearer the ends of it than De Witt shows them,\r\nit would be possible to get a 15-foot aperture, and still leave room\r\nfor the drawn curtains to hang between the aperture and the doors.\r\nAllow 3 feet for the strip of stage between arras and wall, and a\r\nback-run of 10 feet behind the wall, and you get an adequate chamber\r\nof 15 feet × 13 feet. My actual measurements are, of course, merely\r\nillustrative. There would be advantages, as regards vision, in not\r\nmaking the alcove too deep. The height, if the gallery over the stage\r\nran in a line with the middle gallery for spectators, would be about 8\r\nfeet or 9 feet; rather low, I admit.[245] A critic may point out that\r\nbehind the back wall of the outer stage lay the tire-house, and that\r\nthe 14-foot deep framework of a theatre no greater in dimensions than\r\nthe Fortune does not leave room for an inner stage in addition to the\r\ntire-house. I think the answer is that the ‘place behind the stage’ was\r\nin fact nothing but an _enclave_ within the tire-house, that its walls\r\nconsisted of nothing but screens covered with some more arras, that\r\nthese were only put up when they were needed for some particular scene,\r\nand that when they were up, although they extended to nearly the full\r\ndepth of the tire-house, they did not occupy its full width, but left\r\nroom on either side for the actors to crowd into, and for the stairs\r\nleading to the upper floors. When no interior scene had to be set,\r\nthere was nothing between the tire-house and the outer stage but the\r\ncurtains; and this renders quite intelligible the references quoted in\r\nan earlier chapter to actors peeping through a curtain at the audience,\r\nand to the audience ‘banding tile and pear’ against the curtains, to\r\nallure the actors forth.[246] I do not think it is necessary to assume\r\nthat there was a third pair of folding doors permanently fixed in the\r\naperture.[247] They would be big and clumsy, although no doubt they\r\nwould help to keep out noise. In any case, there is not much evidence\r\non the point. If Tarlton’s head was seen ‘the Tire-House doore and\r\ntapistrie betweene’, he may very well have gone to the end of the\r\nnarrow passage behind the arras, and looked out where that was broken\r\nby one of the side-doors. No doubt, however, the aperture is the third\r\nplace of entrance ‘in the midst’, which the stage-directions or action\r\nof some plays require, and which, as such, came to be regarded as a\r\nthird door.[248]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A. SQUARE THEATRE (Proportions of Fortune)]\r\n\r\nI conceive, therefore, of the alcove as a space which the tire-man,\r\nbehind the curtains and in close proximity to the screens and\r\nproperties stored in the tire-house, can arrange as he likes, without\r\nany interruption to continuous action proceeding on the outer stage. He\r\ncan put up a house-front with a door, and if needed, a porch. He can\r\nput up a shop, or for that matter, a couple of adjacent shops. He can\r\nput up the arched gates of a city or castle. These are comparatively\r\nshallow structures. But he can also take advantage of the whole depth\r\nof the space, and arrange a chamber, a cave, or a bower, furnishing\r\nit as he pleases, and adding doors at the back or side, or a back\r\nwindow, which would enable him to give more light, even if only\r\nborrowed light from the tire-house, to an interior scene.[249] One\r\npoint, however, is rather puzzling. There are some scenes which imply\r\nentrance to a chamber, not from behind, but from the open stage in\r\nfront, and by a visible door which can be knocked at or locked. Thus\r\nin _Romeo and Juliet_, of which all the staging is rather difficult\r\non any hypothesis, the Friar observes Juliet coming towards his cell,\r\nand after they have discoursed Juliet bids him shut the door. Here,\r\nno doubt, the Friar may have looked out and seen Juliet through a back\r\nwindow, and she may have entered by a back door. But in an earlier\r\nscene, where we get the stage-direction ‘Enter Nurse and knockes’, and\r\nthe knocking is repeated until the Nurse is admitted to the cell, we\r\nare, I think, bound to suppose that the entry is in front, in the sight\r\nof the audience, and antecedent to the knocking.[250] Perhaps an even\r\nclearer case is in _Captain Thomas Stukeley_, where Stukeley’s chamber\r\nin the Temple is certainly approached from the open stage by a door\r\nat which Stukeley’s father knocks, and which is unlocked and locked\r\nagain.[251] Yet how can a door be inserted in that side of a chamber\r\nwhich is open to the stage and the audience. Possibly it was a very\r\nconventional door set across the narrow space between the arras and\r\nthe back wall of the main stage, at the corner of the aperture and at\r\nright angles to its plane. The accompanying diagrams will perhaps make\r\nmy notion of the inner stage clearer.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: B. OCTAGONAL THEATRE (e.g. Globe; size of Fortune)]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested, by me as well as by others, that the inner stage\r\nmay have been raised by a step or two above the outer stage.[252] On\r\nreflection, I now think this unlikely. There would be none too much\r\nheight to spare, at any rate if the height of the alcove was determined\r\nby that of the spectators’ galleries. The only stage-direction which\r\nsuggests any such arrangement is in the _Death of Robin Hood_, where\r\nthe King sits in a chair behind the curtains, and the Queen ascends to\r\nhim and descends again.[253] But even if the tire-man put up an exalted\r\nseat in this case, there need have been no permanent elevation. The\r\nmissing woodcut of the Anglo-German stage at Frankfort in 1597 is said\r\nto have shown a raised inner stage; but until it is recovered, it is\r\ndifficult to estimate its value as testimony upon the structure of the\r\nLondon theatres.[254]\r\n\r\nIt must not, of course, be taken for granted that every curtain,\r\nreferred to in text or stage-directions as ‘drawn’, was necessarily a\r\nback curtain disclosing an alcove. In some, although not all, of the\r\nbedchamber scenes the indications do not of themselves exclude the\r\nhypothesis of a bed standing on the open stage and the revealing of the\r\noccupant by the mere drawing of bed-curtains.[255] I do not think there\r\nis any certain example of such an arrangement in a sixteenth-century\r\nplay.[256] But tents also could be closed by curtains, and the plot\r\nof _2 Seven Deadly Sins_ requires Henry VI to lie asleep in ‘A tent\r\nbeing plast one the stage’, while dumb-shows enter ‘at one dore’ and\r\n‘at an other dore’.[257] However it may have been with other theatres,\r\nwe cannot, on the evidence before us, assert that the Swan had an\r\nalcove at all; and if it had not, it was probably driven to provide for\r\nchamber scenes by means of some curtained structure on the stage itself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must not be supposed that every case, in which\r\na back curtain was drawn, will have found record in the printed book\r\nof the play concerned; and when the existence of an alcove has once\r\nbeen established, it becomes legitimate to infer its use for various\r\nchamber and analogous scenes, to the presentation of which it would\r\nhave been well adapted. But this inference, again, must not be twisted\r\ninto a theory that the stage in front of the back wall served only for\r\nout-of-door scenes, and that all interior action was housed, wholly\r\nor in part, in the alcove. This is, I think, demonstrably untrue, as\r\nregards the large group of indoor scenes which I have called hall\r\nscenes. In the first place, the alcove would not have been spacious\r\nenough to be of any value for a great many of the hall scenes. You\r\ncould not stage spectacular action, such as that of a coronation, a\r\nsitting of parliament, or a trial at the bar, in a box of 15 by 13 feet\r\nand only 9 feet high. A group of even so many as ten persons clustered\r\nround a bed is quite another thing. I admit the device of the so-called\r\n‘split’ scene, by which action beginning in the alcove is gradually\r\nextended so as to take the whole of the stage into its ambit.[258] This\r\nmight perhaps serve for a court of justice, with the judges in the\r\nalcove, the ‘bar’ drawn across the aperture, and the prisoners brought\r\nin before it. A scene in which the arras is drawn in _Sir Thomas More_\r\npoints to such a setting.[259] But a scene in which a royal ‘state’ is\r\nthe dominating feature would be singularly ineffective if the state\r\nwere wedged in under the low roof of the alcove; and if I am right\r\nin thinking that the ‘state’ normally creaked down into its position\r\nfrom the heavens, it would clearly land, not within the alcove, but\r\nupon the open stage in front of it. Indeed, if it could be placed into\r\nposition behind a curtain, there would be no reason for bringing it\r\nfrom the heavens at all. Then, again, hall scenes are regularly served\r\nby two or more doors, which one certainly would not suppose from the\r\nstage-directions to be any other than the doors similarly used to\r\napproach out-of-door scenes; and they frequently end with injunctions\r\nto ‘come in’, which would be superfluous if the personages on the\r\nstage could be withdrawn from sight by the closing of the curtain.\r\nOccasionally, moreover, the gallery over the stage comes into play in\r\na hall scene, in a way which would not be possible if the personages\r\nwere disposed in the alcove, over which, of course, this gallery\r\nprojected.[260] Some of these considerations tell more directly against\r\nthe exclusive use of the alcove for hall scenes, than against its use\r\nin combination with the outer stage; and this combined use, where\r\nsuitable, I am quite prepared to allow. But ordinarily, I think, the\r\nhall scenes were wholly on the outer stage; and this must necessarily\r\nhave been the case where two rooms were employed, of which one opens\r\nout behind the other.[261]\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the main object of the curtain is to allow of\r\nthe furniture and decorations of a ‘set’ scene, which is usually an\r\ninterior scene, being put in place behind it, without any interruption\r\nto the continuous progress of an act; and that hall scenes cannot\r\nbe set properly, unless they also are behind the curtain line. I do\r\nnot think that there is much in this argument. A hall scene does\r\nnot require so much setting as a chamber scene. It is sufficiently\r\nfurnished, at any rate over the greater part of its area, with the\r\nstate and such lesser seats as can very readily be carried on during\r\nthe opening speeches or during the procession by which the action is\r\noften introduced. A bar can be set up, or a banquet spread, or a sick\r\nman brought in on his chair, as part of the action itself.[262] Even\r\nan out-of-door scene, such as an execution or a duel in the lists,\r\nsometimes demands a similar adjustment;[263] it need no more give pause\r\nthan the analogous devices entailed by the removal of dead bodies from\r\nwhere they have fallen.\r\n\r\nI must not be taken to give any countenance to the doctrine that\r\nproperties, incongruous to the particular scene that was being played,\r\nwere allowed to stand on the public Elizabethan stage, and that the\r\naudience, actually or through a convention, was not disturbed by\r\nthem.[264] This doctrine appears to me to rest upon misunderstandings\r\nof the evidence produced in its support, and in particular upon a\r\nfailure to distinguish between the transitional methods of setting\r\nemployed by Lyly and his clan, and those of the permanent theatres\r\nwith which we are now concerned. The former certainly permitted of\r\nincongruities in the sense that, as the neo-classic stage strove to\r\nadapt itself to a romantic subject-matter, separate localities, with\r\ninconsistent properties, came to be set at one and the same time in\r\ndifferent regions of the stage. But the system proved inadequate to\r\nthe needs of romanticism, as popular audiences understood it; and,\r\napart from some apparent rejuvenescence in the ‘private’ houses,\r\nwith which I must deal later, it gave way, about the time of the\r\nbuilding of the permanent theatres, to the alternative system, by\r\nwhich different localities were represented, not synchronously but\r\nsuccessively, and each in its turn had full occupation of the whole\r\nfield of the stage. This full occupation was not, I venture to think,\r\nqualified by the presence in any scene of a property inappropriate\r\nto that scene, but retained there because it had been used for some\r\nprevious, or was to be used for some coming, scene. I do not mean to\r\nsay that some colourless or insignificant property, such as a bench,\r\nmay not have served, without being moved, first in an indoors and then\r\nin an out-of-doors scene. But that the management of the Theatre or\r\nthe Rose was so bankrupt in ingenuity that the audience had to watch\r\na coronation through a fringe of trees or to pretend unconsciousness\r\nwhile the strayed lovers in a forest dodged each other round the\r\ncorners of a derelict ‘state’, I, for one, see no adequate reason to\r\nbelieve. It is chiefly the state and the trees which have caused the\r\ntrouble. But, after all, a state which has creaked down can creak up\r\nagain, just as a banquet or a gallows which has been carried on can be\r\ncarried off. Trees are perhaps a little more difficult. A procession of\r\nporters, each with a tree in his arms, would be a legitimate subject\r\nfor the raillery of _The Admirable Bashville_. A special back curtain\r\npainted _en pastoralle_ would hardly be adequate, even if there were\r\nany evidence for changes of curtain; trees were certainly sometimes\r\npracticable and therefore quasi-solid.[265] The alcove, filled with\r\nshrubs, would by itself give the illusion of a greenhouse rather\r\nthan a forest; moreover, the alcove was available in forest scenes\r\nto serve as a rustic bower or cottage.[266] Probably the number of\r\ntrees dispersed over the body of the stage was not great; they were a\r\nsymbolical rather than a realistic setting. On the whole, I am inclined\r\nto think that, at need, trees ascended and descended through traps;\r\nand that this is not a mere conjecture is suggested by a few cases in\r\nwhich the ascent and descent, being part of a conjuring action, are\r\nrecorded in the stage-directions.[267] One of these shows that the\r\ntraps would carry not merely a tree but an arbour. The traps had, of\r\ncourse, other functions. Through them apparitions arose and sank;[268]\r\nJonah was spewed up from the whale’s belly;[269] and the old device of\r\nhell-mouth still kept alive a mediaeval tradition.[270] Only primitive\r\nhydraulics would have been required to make a fountain flow or a fog\r\narise;[271] although it may perhaps be supposed that the episodes,\r\nin which personages pass to and from boats or fling themselves into\r\na river, were performed upon the extreme edge of the stage rather\r\nthan over a trap.[272] I do not find any clear case, in the public\r\nsixteenth-century theatres, of the convention apparently traceable in\r\nLyly and Whetstone, by which the extreme edge of the stage is used\r\nfor ‘approach’ scenes, as when a traveller arrives from afar, or when\r\nsome episode has to be represented in the environs of a city which\r\nfurnishes the principal setting.[273] And I think it would certainly\r\nbe wrong to regard the main stage, apart from the alcove, as divided\r\ninto an inner area covered by the heavens and an outer area, not so\r\ncovered and appropriate to open-country scenes. Indeed, the notion that\r\nany substantial section of the stage appeared to the audience not to\r\nlie under the heavens is in my view an illusion due to the unskilful\r\ndraughtsmanship of De Witt or his copyist. Skyey phenomena belong most\r\nnaturally to open-country scenes, nor are these wholly debarred from\r\nthe use of the state; and the machinery employed in both cases seems to\r\nimply the existence of a superincumbent heavens.[274]\r\n\r\nI come finally to the interesting question of the gallery above the\r\nstage. This, in the Swan drawing, may project very slightly over the\r\nscenic wall, and is divided by short vertical columns into six small\r\ncompartments, in each of which one or two occupants are sitting. They\r\nmight, of course, be personages in the play; but, if so, they seem\r\ncuriously dissociated from the action. They might be musicians, but\r\nthey appear to include women, and there is no clear sign of musical\r\ninstruments. On the whole, they have the air of spectators.[275]\r\nHowever this may be, let us recall what has already been established\r\nin an earlier chapter, that there is conclusive evidence for some use\r\nof the space above the stage for spectators, at least until the end\r\nof the sixteenth century, and for some use of it as a music-room, at\r\nleast during the seventeenth century.[276] With these uses we have\r\nto reconcile the equally clear indications that this region, or some\r\npart of it, was available when needed, throughout the whole of the\r\nperiod under our consideration, as a field for dramatic action. For\r\nthe moment we are only concerned with the sixteenth century. A glance\r\nback over my footnotes will show many examples in which action is said\r\nto be ‘above’ or ‘aloft’, or is accompanied by the ascent or descent\r\nof personages from or to the level of the main stage. This interplay\r\nof different levels is indeed the outstanding characteristic of the\r\nElizabethan public theatre, as compared with the other systems of\r\nstage-presentment to which it stands in relation. There are mediaeval\r\nanalogies, no doubt, and one would not wish to assert categorically\r\nthat no use was ever made of a balcony or a house-roof in a Greek\r\nor Roman or Italian setting. But, broadly speaking, the classical\r\nand neo-classical stage-tradition, apart from theophanies, is one of\r\naction on a single level. Even in the Elizabethan Court drama, the\r\nplatform comes in late and rarely, although the constant references to\r\n‘battlements’ in the Revels Accounts enable us to infer that, by the\r\ntime when the public theatres came to be built, the case of _Orestes_\r\nwas not an isolated one. Battlements, whatever the extension which\r\nthe Revels officers came to give to the term, were primarily for\r\nthe beloved siege scenes, and to the way in which siege scenes were\r\ntreated in the theatres I must revert. But from two plays, _The Rare\r\nTriumphs of Love and Fortune_ and _The Woman in the Moon_, both of\r\nwhich probably represent a late development of the Court drama, we may\r\ngather at least one other definite function of the platform, as a point\r\nof vantage from which presenters, in both cases of a divine type, may\r\nsit ‘sunning like a crow in a gutter’, and watch the evolution of their\r\npuppets on the stage below.[277] This disposition of presenters ‘aloft’\r\nfinds more than one parallel in the public theatres. The divine element\r\nis retained in _The Battle of Alcazar_, where Henslowe’s plot gives us,\r\nas part of the direction for a dumb-show, ‘Enter aboue Nemesis’.[278]\r\nThere are traces of it also in _James IV_ and in _A Looking Glass for\r\nLondon and England_. In _James IV_ the presenters are Bohan, a Scot,\r\nand Oberon, king of fairies. They come on the stage for an induction,\r\nat the end of which Bohan says, ‘Gang with me to the Gallery, and Ile\r\nshow thee the same in action by guid fellowes of our country men’, and\r\nthey ‘_Exeunt_’. Obviously they watch the action, for they enter again\r\nand comment upon it during act-intervals. One of their interpositions\r\nis closed with the words ‘Gow shrowd vs in our harbor’; another with\r\n‘Lets to our sell, and sit & see the rest’.[279] In the _Looking Glass_\r\nwe get after the first scene the direction, ‘Enters brought in by an\r\nangell Oseas the Prophet, and set downe ouer the Stage in a Throne’.\r\nOseas is evidently a presenter; the actors ignore him, but he makes\r\nmoral comments after various scenes, and at the end of Act IV comes the\r\nfurther direction, ‘Oseas taken away’.[280] Purely human presenters in\r\n_The Taming of a Shrew_ are still on a raised level. Sly is removed\r\nfrom the main stage during the first scene of the induction. He is\r\nbrought back at the beginning of the second scene, presumably above,\r\nwhence he criticizes the play, for towards the end the lord bids his\r\nservants\r\n\r\n        lay him in the place where we did find him,\r\n    Just underneath the alehouse side below;\r\n\r\nand this is done by way of an epilogue.[281]\r\n\r\nI do not suggest that presenters were always above; it is not so when\r\nthey merely furnish the equivalent of a prologue or epilogue, but only\r\nwhen it is desired to keep them visible during the action, and on\r\nthe other hand they must not obstruct it. Sometimes, even when their\r\ncontinued presence might be desirable, it has to be dispensed with, or\r\notherwise provided for. The presenters in _Soliman and Perseda_ come\r\nand go; those in _The Spanish Tragedy_ sit upon the stage itself. Why?\r\nI think the answer is the same in both cases. A platform was required\r\nfor other purposes. In _Soliman and Perseda_ one scene has the outer\r\nwall of a tiltyard reached by ladders from the stage; another has a\r\ntower, from which victims are tumbled down out of sight.[282] In the\r\n_Spanish Tragedy_, apart from some minor action ‘above’, there is\r\nthe elaborate presentation of Hieronimo’s ‘play within the play’ to\r\nbe provided for. This must be supposed to be part of a hall scene.\r\nIt occupies, with its preparations, most of the fourth, which is\r\nthe last, act; and for it the King and his train are clearly seated\r\nin an upper ‘gallerie’, while the performance takes place on the\r\nfloor of the hall below, with the body of Horatio concealed behind a\r\ncurtain, for revelation at the appropriate moment.[283] We are thus\r\nbrought face to face with an extension on the public stage of the\r\nuse of ‘above’, beyond what is entailed by the needs of sieges or of\r\nexalted presenters. Nor, of course, are the instances already cited\r\nexhaustive. The gallery overlooking a hall in the _Spanish Tragedy_ has\r\nits parallel in the window overlooking a hall in _Dr. Faustus_.[284]\r\nMore frequent is an external window, door, or balcony, overlooking an\r\nexternal scene in street or garden.[285] In these cases the action\r\n‘above’ is generally slight. Some one appears in answer to a summons\r\nfrom without; an eavesdropper listens to a conversation below; a girl\r\ntalks to her lover, and there may be an ascent or descent with the help\r\nof a rope-ladder or a basket. But there are a few plays in which we\r\nare obliged to constitute the existence of a regular chamber scene,\r\nwith several personages and perhaps furniture, set ‘above’. The second\r\nscene of the induction to the _Taming of the Shrew_, just cited, is\r\nalready a case in point. The presenters here do not merely sit, as\r\nspectators in the lord’s room might, and listen. They move about a\r\nchamber and occupy considerable space. Scenes which similarly require\r\nthe whole interior of an upper room to be visible, and not merely its\r\nbalcony or window bay, are to be found in _1 Sir John Oldcastle_, in\r\n_Every Man In his Humour_, twice in _The Jew of Malta_, in _2 Henry\r\nIV_, and in _Look About You_.[286] I do not know whether I ought to add\r\n_Romeo and Juliet_. Certainly the love scenes, Act II, scc. i and ii,\r\nand Act III, sc. v, require Juliet’s chamber to be aloft, and in these\r\nthere is no interior action entailing more than the sound of voices,\r\nfollowed by the appearance of the speakers over Juliet’s shoulder as\r\nshe stands at the casement or on a balcony.[287] It would be natural\r\nto assume that the chamber of Act IV, sc. iii, in which Juliet drinks\r\nher potion, and sc. v, in which she is found lying on her bed, is the\r\nsame, and therefore also aloft. Obviously its interior, with the bed\r\nand Juliet, must be visible to the spectators. The difficulty is that\r\nit also appears to be visible to the wedding guests and the musicians,\r\nas they enter the courtyard from without; and this could only be,\r\nif it were upon the main level of the stage. If the scene stood by\r\nitself, one would undoubtedly assign it to the curtained recess behind\r\nthe stage; and on the whole it is probable that on this occasion\r\narchitectural consistency was sacrificed to dramatic effect, and\r\nJuliet’s chamber was placed sometimes above and sometimes below.[288]\r\nThere is one other type of scene which requires elevated action, and\r\nthat is the senate-house scene, as we find it in _The Wounds of Civil\r\nWar_ and in _Titus Andronicus_, where the Capitol clearly stands above\r\nthe Forum, but is within ear-shot and of easy approach.[289]\r\n\r\nI think we are bound to assume that some or all of this action ‘above’\r\ntook place in the gallery ‘over the stage’, where it could be readily\r\napproached from the tiring-house behind, and could be disposed with the\r\nminimum of obstruction to the vision of the auditorium. A transition\r\nfrom the use of this region for spectators to its use for action is\r\nafforded by the placing there of those idealized spectators, the\r\npresenters. So far as they are concerned, all that would be needed, in\r\na house arranged like the Swan, would be to assign to them one or more,\r\naccording to their number, of the rooms or compartments, into which the\r\ngallery was normally divided. One such compartment, too, would serve\r\nwell for a window, and would be accepted without demur as forming part\r\nof the same ‘domus’ to which a door below, or, as in _The Merchant\r\nof Venice_, a penthouse set in the central aperture, gave access.\r\nTo get a practicable chamber, it would be necessary to take down a\r\npartition and throw two of the compartments, probably the two central\r\ncompartments, into one; but there would still be four rooms left for\r\nthe lords. As a matter of fact, most upper chamber scenes, even of\r\nthe sixteenth century, are of later date than the Swan drawing, and\r\nsome architectural evolution, including the provision of a music-room,\r\nmay already have taken place, and have been facilitated by the waning\r\npopularity of the lord’s rooms. It will be easier to survey the whole\r\nevolution of the upper stage in the next chapter.[290] For the present,\r\nlet us think of the upper chamber as running back on the first floor of\r\nthe tiring-house above the alcove, and reached from within by stairs\r\nbehind the scenic wall, of which, if desired, the foot could perhaps be\r\nmade visible within the alcove.[291] Borrowed light could be given by\r\na window at the back, from which also the occupants of the room could\r\npretend to look out behind.[292] Internal doors could of course also be\r\nmade available. A scene in _The Jew of Malta_ requires a trap in the\r\nfloor of the upper chamber, over a cauldron discovered in the alcove\r\nbelow.[293] The upper chamber could be fitted, like the alcove itself,\r\nwith an independent curtain for discoveries.[294]\r\n\r\nAre we to conclude that all action ‘above’ was on or behind the back\r\nline of the stage? The point upon which I feel most uncertainty is\r\nthe arrangement of the battlements in the stricter sense.[295] These\r\nappear to be generally regarded as running along the whole of the back\r\nline, with the gates of the town or castle represented in the central\r\naperture below. Some writers suggest that they occupied, not the actual\r\nspace of the rooms or boxes ‘over the stage’, but a narrow balcony\r\nrunning in front of these.[296] I cannot satisfy myself that the Swan\r\ndrawing bears out the existence of any projecting ledge adequate for\r\nthe purpose. On the other hand, if all the compartments of the gallery\r\nwere made available and their partitions removed, all the spectators\r\n‘over the stage’ must have been displaced; and siege scenes are early,\r\nand numerous. I do not know that it is essential to assume that the\r\nbattlements extended beyond the width of two compartments. There is\r\nsome definite evidence for a position of the ‘walles’ on the scenic\r\nline, apart from the patent convenience of keeping the main stage clear\r\nfor besieging armies, in Jasper Mayne’s laudation of Ben Jonson:\r\n\r\n    Thou laid’st no sieges to the music-room.[297]\r\n\r\nI am content to believe that this is where they normally stood. At\r\nthe same time, it is possible that alternative arrangements were not\r\nunknown. In the _Wagner Book_, which must be supposed to describe a\r\nsetting of a type not incredible on the public stage, we are told of\r\na high throne, presumably at the back, of hell mouth ‘at the one\r\nend of the stage’, and of an elaborate castle ‘at the other end in\r\nopposition’. This is ‘the place where in the bloudlesse skirmishes\r\nare so often perfourmed upon the stage’, and although I should not\r\npress this as meaning that the walls were always at an ‘end’ of the\r\nstage, the passage would be absurd, if they were invariably at the\r\nback.[298] Further, there is at least one extant play in which it is\r\nvery difficult to envisage certain scenes with the walls at the back.\r\nThis is _1 Henry VI_, the Orleans scenes of which, with the leaping\r\nover the walls, and the rapid succession of action in the market-place\r\nwithin the town and in the field without, seem to me clearly to point\r\nto walls standing across the main stage from back to front.[299] But if\r\nso, how were such walls put into place? The imagination boggles at the\r\nnotion of masons coming in to build a wall during the action, in the\r\nway in which attendants might set up a bar or a lists, or carpenters\r\nthe gibbet for an execution. Bottom’s device for _Pyramus and Thisbe_\r\nwould hardly be more grotesque. Yet the Orleans siege scenes in _1\r\nHenry VI_ are by no means coincident with acts, and could not therefore\r\nbe set in advance and dismantled at leisure when done with. Can the\r\nwalls have been drawn forwards and backwards, with the help of some\r\nmachine, through the doors or the central aperture?[300] It is not\r\ninconceivable, and possibly we have here the explanation of the ‘j\r\nwhell and frame in the Sege of London’, which figures in the Admiral’s\r\ninventories. Once the possibility of a scenic structure brought on to\r\nthe main stage is mooted, one begins to look for other kinds of episode\r\nin which it would be useful. This, after all, may have been the way in\r\nwhich a gibbet was introduced, and the Admiral’s had also ‘j frame for\r\nthe heading in Black Jone’, although nothing is said of a wheel.[301]\r\nThe senate houses could, I think, have been located in the gallery,\r\nbut the beacon in _King Leir_ would not look plausible there, and the\r\nAdmiral’s had a beacon, apparently as a detached property.[302] I am\r\nalso inclined to think that a wall may occasionally have been drawn\r\nacross the stage to make a close of part of it for a garden scene. In\r\nAct II of _Romeo and Juliet_ Romeo pretty clearly comes in with his\r\nfriends in some public place of the city, and then leaps a wall into\r\nan orchard, where he is lost to their sight, and finds himself under\r\nJuliet’s window. He must have a wall to leap. I mentioned _Pyramus and\r\nThisbe_ just above with intent, for what is _Pyramus and Thisbe_ but a\r\nburlesque of the _Romeo and Juliet_ motive, which would have been all\r\nthe more amusing, if a somewhat conspicuous and unusual wall had been\r\nintroduced into its model? Another case in point may be the ‘close\r\nwalk’ before Labervele’s house in _A Humorous Day’s Mirth_.[303] I have\r\nallowed myself to stray into the field of conjecture.\r\n\r\nOne other possible feature of action ‘above’ must not be left out of\r\naccount. The use of the gallery may have been supplemented on occasion\r\nby that of some window or balcony in the space above it, which De\r\nWitt’s drawing conceals from our view. Here may have been the ‘top’ on\r\nwhich La Pucelle appears in the Rouen episode of _1 Henry VI_, and the\r\ntowers or turrets, which are sometimes utilized or referred to in this\r\nand other plays.[304] It would be difficult to describe the central\r\nboxes of the Swan gallery as a tower.\r\n\r\nBefore any attempt is made to sum up the result of this long\r\nchapter, one other feature of sixteenth-century staging, which is\r\noften overlooked, requires discussion. In the majority of cases the\r\nbackground of an out-of-door scene need contain at most a single\r\n_domus_; and this, it is now clear, can be represented either by a\r\nlight structure, such as a tent or arbour, placed temporarily upon\r\nthe floor of the stage, or more usually by the _scena_ or back wall,\r\nwith its doors, its central aperture, and its upper gallery. There\r\nare, however, certain scenes in which one _domus_ will not suffice,\r\nand two or possibly even three, must be represented. Thus, as in\r\n_Richard III_, there may be two hostile camps, with alternating action\r\nat tents in each of them.[305] There may also be interplay, without\r\nchange of scene, between different houses in one town or village.\r\nIn _Arden of Feversham_, Arden’s house and the painter’s are set\r\ntogether;[306] in _The Taming of A Shrew_, the lord’s house and the\r\nalehouse for the induction, and Polidor’s and Alphonso’s during the\r\nmain play;[307] in _The Blind Beggar of Alexandria_, the houses of\r\nElimine and Samethis;[308] in _1 Sir John Oldcastle_, Cobham’s gate\r\nand an inn;[309] in _Stukeley_, Newton’s house and a chamber in the\r\nTemple;[310] in _A Knack to Know an Honest Man_, Lelio’s and Bristeo’s\r\nfor one scene, Lelio’s and a Senator’s for another, possibly Lelio’s\r\nand Servio’s, though of this I am less sure, for a third.[311] These\r\nare the most indisputable cases; given the principle, we are at liberty\r\nto conjecture its application in other plays. Generally the houses\r\nmay be supposed to be contiguous; it is not so in _Stukeley_, where\r\nOld Stukeley clearly walks some little distance to the Temple, and\r\nhere therefore we get an example of that foreshortening of distance\r\nbetween two parts of a city, with which we became familiar in the\r\narrangement of Court plays.[312] It is not the only example. In\r\n_George a Greene_ Jenkin and the Shoemaker walk from one end to the\r\nother of Wakefield.[313] In _Arden of Feversham_, although this is\r\nan open-country and not an urban scene, Arden and Francklin travel\r\nsome little way to Raynham Down.[314] In _Dr. Faustus_, so far as\r\nwe can judge from the unsatisfactory text preserved, any limitation\r\nto a particular neighbourhood is abandoned, and Faustus passes\r\nwithout change of scene from the Emperor’s Court to his own home in\r\nWittenberg.[315] Somewhat analogous is the curious device in _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_, where the maskers, after preparing in the open, ‘march about\r\nthe stage’, while the scene changes to the hall of Capulet, which they\r\nthen enter.[316]\r\n\r\nI think, then, it must be taken that the background of a public stage\r\ncould stand at need, not merely for a single _domus_, but for a ‘city’.\r\nPresumably in such cases the central aperture and the gallery above it\r\nwere reserved for any house in which interior action was to proceed,\r\nand for the others mere doors in the scenic wall were regarded as\r\nadequate. I do not find any sixteenth-century play which demands either\r\ninterior action or action ‘above’ in more than one house.[317] But a\r\nquestion arises as to how, for a scene in which the scenic doors had to\r\nrepresent house doors, provision was made for external entrances and\r\nexits, which certainly cannot be excluded from such scenes. Possibly\r\nthe answer is, although I feel very doubtful about it, that there\r\nwere never more than two houses, and that therefore one door always\r\nremained available to lead on and off the main stage.[318] Possibly\r\nalso entrances and exits by other avenues than the two scenic doors,\r\nwhich we infer from the Swan drawing, and the central aperture which we\r\nfeel bound to add, are not inconceivable. We have already had some hint\r\nthat three may not have been the maximum number of entrances. If the\r\nElizabethan theatre limited itself to three, it would have been worse\r\noff than any of the early neo-classic theatres based upon Vitruvius, in\r\nwhich the _porta regia_ and _portae minores_ of the scenic wall were\r\nregularly supplemented by the _viae ad forum_ in the _versurae_ to\r\nright and left of the _proscenium_.[319] No doubt such wings could not\r\nbe constructed at the Swan, where a space was left on the level of the\r\n‘yard’ between the spectators’ galleries and the right and left edges\r\nof a narrow stage. But they would be feasible in theatres with wider\r\nstages, and the arrangement, if it existed, would make the problem of\r\nseats on the stage easier.[320] It is no more than a conjecture. It has\r\nalso been suggested that the heavy columns drawn by De Witt may have\r\nprevented him from showing two entrances round the extreme ends of the\r\nscenic wall, such as are perhaps indicated in some of the Terentian\r\nwoodcuts of 1493.[321] Or, finally, actors might have emerged from the\r\ntiring-house into the space on the level of the yard just referred to,\r\nand thence reached the stage, as from without, by means of a short\r\nflight of steps.[322]\r\n\r\nWorking then from the Swan stage, and only departing in any essential\r\nfrom De Witt’s drawing by what appears to be, at any rate for theatres\r\nother than the Swan, the inevitable addition of a back curtain, we\r\nfind no insuperable difficulty in accounting for the setting of all\r\nthe types of scenes recognizable in sixteenth-century plays. The\r\ngreat majority of them, both out-of-door scenes and hall scenes, were\r\nacted on the open stage, under the heavens, with no more properties\r\nand practicable _terrains_ than could reasonably be carried on by the\r\nactors, lowered from the heavens, raised by traps, or thrust on by\r\nframes and wheels. For more permanent background they had the scenic\r\ndoors, the gallery above, the scenic curtain, and whatever the tire-man\r\nmight choose to insert in the aperture, backed by an alcove within the\r\ntire-house, which the drawing of the curtain discovered. For entrances\r\nthey had at least the scenic doors and aperture. The comparatively few\r\nchamber scenes were set either in the alcove or in a chamber ‘above’,\r\nformed by throwing together two compartments of the gallery. A window\r\nin a still higher story could, if necessary, be brought into play. So,\r\nwith all due respect to the obscurities of the evidence, I reconstruct\r\nthe facts. It will, I hope, be apparent without any elaborate\r\ndemonstration that this system of public staging, as practised by\r\nBurbadge at the Theatre, by Lanman at the Curtain, by Henslowe at the\r\nRose, and perhaps with some modifications by Langley at the Swan, is\r\nvery fairly in line with the earlier sixteenth-century tradition, as\r\nwe have studied it in texts in which the Court methods are paramount.\r\nThis is only natural, in view of the fact that the same plays continued\r\nto be presented to the public and to the sovereign. There is the same\r\neconomy of recessed action, the same conspicuous tendency to dialogue\r\non a threshold, the same unwillingness to break the flow of an act by\r\nany deliberate pause for resetting. The public theatre gets in some\r\nways a greater variety of dramatic situation, partly owing to its free\r\nuse of the open stage, instead of merely a portico, for hall scenes,\r\npartly owing to its characteristic development of action ‘above’.\r\nThis, in spite of the battlements of the Revels accounts, may perhaps\r\nbe a contribution of the inn-yard. The main change is, of course, the\r\nsubstitution for the multiple staging of the Court, with its adjacent\r\nregions for different episodes, of a principle of successive staging,\r\nby which the whole space became in turn available for each distinct\r\nscene. This was an inevitable change, as soon as the Elizabethan love\r\nfor history and romance broke down the Renaissance doctrine of the\r\nunity of place; and it will not be forgotten that the beginnings of\r\nit are already clearly discernible in the later Court drama, which of\r\ncourse overlaps with the popular drama, itself. Incidentally the actors\r\ngot elbow-room; some of the Lylyan scenes must have been very cramped.\r\nBut they had to put up with a common form setting, capable only of\r\nminor modifications, and no doubt their architectural decorations and\r\nunvarying curtain were less interesting from the point of view of\r\n_spectacle_, than the diversity of ‘houses’ which the ingenuity and\r\nthe resources of the Court architects were in a position to produce.\r\nIn any case, however, economy would probably have forbidden them to\r\nenter into rivalry with the Revels Office. Whether the Elizabethan type\r\nof public stage was the invention of Burbadge, the ‘first builder of\r\ntheatres’, or had already come into use in the inn-yards, is perhaps\r\nan idle subject for wonder. The only definite guess at its origin\r\nis that of Professor Creizenach, who suggests that it may have been\r\nadapted from the out-of-door stages, set up from time to time for the\r\ndramatic contests held by the Rederijker or Chambers of Rhetoric in\r\nFlanders.[323] Certainly there are common features in the division of\r\nthe field of action into two levels and the use of curtained apertures\r\nboth below and above. But the latest examples of the Flemish festivals\r\nwere at Ghent in 1539 and at Antwerp in 1561 respectively; and it would\r\nbe something of a chance if Burbadge or any other English builder had\r\nany detailed knowledge of them.[324]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXI\r\n\r\n             STAGING IN THE THEATRES: SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n            [For _Bibliographical Note_, _vide_ ch. xviii.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe turn of the century is also a turning-point in the history of the\r\npublic theatres. In 1599 the Chamberlain’s men built the Globe, and in\r\n1600, not to be outdone, the Admiral’s men built upon the same model\r\nthe Fortune. These remained the head-quarters of the same companies,\r\nwhen at the beginning of the reign of James the one became the King’s\r\nand the other the Prince’s men. Worcester’s, afterwards the Queen’s,\r\nmen were content for a time with the older houses, first the Rose,\r\nthen the Curtain and the Boar’s Head, but by 1605 or 1606 they were\r\noccupying the Red Bull, probably a new building, but one of which we\r\nknow very little. Meanwhile the earlier Tudor fashion of plays by boys\r\nhad been revived, both at Paul’s, and at the Blackfriars, where a\r\ntheatre had been contrived by James Burbadge about 1596 in a chamber of\r\nthe ancient priory, for the purposes of a public stage.\r\n\r\nWe cannot on _a priori_ grounds assume that the structural arrangements\r\nof the sixteenth-century houses were merely carried into those of\r\nthe seventeenth century without modification; the experience of\r\ntwenty-five years’ working may well have disclosed features in the\r\noriginal plan of James Burbadge which were not altogether convenient\r\nor which lent themselves to further development. On the other\r\nhand, we have not got to take into account the possibility of any\r\nfundamental change or sharp breach of continuity. The introduction\r\nof a new type of stage, even if it escaped explicit record, would\r\ninevitably have left its mark both upon the dramatic construction of\r\nplays and upon the wording of their stage-directions. No such mark\r\ncan be discerned. You cannot tell an early seventeenth-century play\r\nfrom a late sixteenth-century one on this kind of evidence alone;\r\nthe handling and the conventions, the situations and the spectacular\r\neffects, remain broadly the same, and such differences as do gradually\r\nbecome apparent, concern rather the trend of dramatic interest than\r\nthe external methods of stage-presentation. Moreover, it is evident\r\nthat the sixteenth-century plays did not pass wholly into disuse. From\r\ntime to time they were revived, and lent themselves, perhaps with some\r\nminor adaptation, to the new boards as well as to the old. In dealing\r\nwith early seventeenth-century staging, then, I will assume the general\r\ncontinuance of the sixteenth-century plan, and will content myself with\r\ngiving some further examples of its main features, and with considering\r\nany evidence which may seem to point to specific development in one\r\nor more particular directions. And on the whole it will be convenient\r\nto concentrate now mainly upon the theatres occupied by the King’s\r\nmen. For this there are various reasons. One is that the possession of\r\nShakespeare’s plays gives them a prerogative interest in modern eyes;\r\nanother that the repertories of the other companies have hardly reached\r\nus in a form which renders any very safe induction feasible.\r\n\r\nEven in the case of the King’s men, the material is not very ample, and\r\nthere are complications which make it necessary to proceed by cautious\r\nsteps to somewhat tentative conclusions. The Globe was probably opened\r\nin the autumn of 1599. The first play which we can definitely locate\r\nthere is _Every Man Out of his Humour_; but I have decided with some\r\nhesitation to treat _Henry V_ and _Much Ado about Nothing_, for the\r\npurposes of these chapters, as Globe plays.[325] So far as we know,\r\nthe Globe was the only theatre used by the company up to the winter\r\nof 1609, when they also came into possession of the Blackfriars. From\r\n1609 to 1613 they used both houses, but probably the Globe was still\r\nthe more important of the two, for when it was burnt in 1613 they\r\nfound it worth while to rebuild it fairer than before. At some time,\r\npossibly about the end of James’s reign, the Blackfriars began to come\r\ninto greater prominence, and gradually displaced the Globe as the main\r\nhead-quarters of the London drama. This, however, is a development\r\nwhich lies outside the scope of these volumes; nor can I with advantage\r\ninquire in detail whether there were any important structural features\r\nin which the new Globe is likely to have differed from the old Globe.\r\nAt the most I can only offer a suggestion for the historian of the\r\nCaroline stage to take up in his turn. In the main, therefore, we\r\nhave to consider the staging of the Globe from 1599 to 1609, and of\r\nthe Globe and the Blackfriars from 1609 to 1613. The plays available\r\nfall into four groups. There are nineteen or twenty printed and\r\nprobably produced during 1599–1609, of which, however, one or two were\r\noriginally written for private theatres.[326] There are two produced\r\nand printed during 1609–12, and one preserved in manuscript from the\r\nsame period.[327] There are ten probably produced during 1599–1603,\r\nbut not printed before 1622 or 1623.[328] There are perhaps nine or\r\nten produced during 1609–13, and printed at various dates from 1619 to\r\n1634.[329] It will be seen that the first group is of much the greatest\r\nvalue evidentially, as well as fortunately the longest, but that it\r\nonly throws light upon the Globe and not upon the Blackfriars; that\r\nthe value of the second and fourth groups is discounted by our not\r\nknowing how far they reflect Globe and how far Blackfriars conditions;\r\nand that the original features of the third and fourth groups may\r\nhave been modified in revivals, either at the Blackfriars or at the\r\nlater Globe, before they got into print. I shall use them all, but,\r\nI hope, with discrimination.[330] I shall also use, for illustration\r\nand confirmation, rather than as direct evidence, plays from other\r\nseventeenth-century theatres. The Prince’s men were at the Fortune\r\nduring the whole of the period with which we are concerned, and then on\r\nto and after the fire of 1621, and the reconstruction, possibly on new\r\nlines, of 1623. We know that its staging arrangements resembled those\r\nof the Globe, for it was provided in the builder’s contract that this\r\nshould be so, and also that the stage should be ‘placed and sett’ in\r\naccordance with ‘a plott thereof drawen’. Alleyn would have saved me\r\na great deal of trouble if he had put away this little piece of paper\r\nalong with so many others. Unfortunately, the Prince’s men kept their\r\nplays very close, and only five or six of our period got into print\r\nbefore 1623.[331] From the Queen’s men we have rather more, perhaps\r\nsixteen in all; but we do not always know whether these were given at\r\nthe Red Bull or the Curtain. Nor do we know whether any structural\r\nimprovements introduced at the Globe and Fortune were adopted at the\r\nRed Bull, although this is _a priori_ not unlikely.[332] From the Swan\r\nwe have only _The Chaste Maid of Cheapside_, and from the Hope only\r\n_Bartholomew Fair_.\r\n\r\nAt the Globe, then, the types of scene presented are much the same as\r\nthose with which we have become familiar in the sixteenth century; the\r\nold categories of open-country scenes, battle scenes, garden scenes,\r\nstreet scenes, threshold scenes, hall scenes, and chamber scenes\r\nwill still serve. Their relative importance alters, no doubt, as the\r\nplaywrights tend more and more to concern themselves with subjects of\r\nurban life. But there are plenty of battle scenes in certain plays,\r\nmuch on the traditional lines, with marchings and counter-marchings,\r\nalarums for fighting ‘within’, and occasional ‘excursions’ on the field\r\nof the stage itself.[333] Practicable tents still afford a convenient\r\ncamp background, and these, I think, continue to be pitched on the\r\nopen boards.[334] The opposing camps of _Richard III_ are precisely\r\nrepeated in _Henry V_.[335] There are episodes before the ‘walls’\r\ntoo, with defenders speaking from above, assaults by means of scaling\r\nladders, and coming and going through the gates.[336] I find no example\r\nin which a wall inserted on the line of the scenic curtain would not\r\nmeet the needs of the situation. Pastoral scenes are also common, for\r\nthe urban preoccupation has its regular reaction in the direction of\r\npastoral. There is plenty of evidence for practicable trees, such as\r\nthat on which Orlando in _As You Like It_ hangs his love verses, and\r\nthe most likely machinery for putting trees into position still seems\r\nto me to be the trap.[337] A trap, too, might bring up the bower for\r\nthe play within the play of _Hamlet_, the pleached arbour of _Much\r\nAdo about Nothing_, the pulpit in the forum of _Julius Caesar_, the\r\ntombstone in the woods of _Timon of Athens_, the wayside cross of\r\n_Every Man Out of his Humour_, and other _terrains_ most easily thought\r\nof as free-standing structures.[338] It would open for Ophelia’s\r\ngrave, and for the still beloved ascents of spirits from the lower\r\nregions.[339] It remains difficult to see how a riverbank or the\r\nsea-shores was represented.[340] As a rule, the edge of the stage, with\r\nsteps into the auditorium taken for water stairs, seems most plausible.\r\nBut there is a complicated episode in _The Devil’s Charter_, with a\r\nconduit and a bridge over the Tiber, which I do not feel quite able\r\nto envisage.[341] There is another bridge over the Tiber for Horatius\r\nCocles in the Red Bull play of the _Rape of Lucrece_. But this is\r\neasier; it is projected from the walls of Rome, and there must be a\r\ntrapped cavity on the scenic line, into which Horatius leaps.[342]\r\n\r\nThe Hope contract of 1613 provides for the heavens to be supported\r\nwithout the help of posts rising from the stage. For this there was\r\na special reason at the Hope, since the stage had to be capable of\r\nremoval to make room for bear-baitings. But the advantage of dispensing\r\nwith the posts and the obstacle to the free vision of the spectators\r\nwhich they presented must have been so great, that the innovation may\r\nwell have occurred to the builders of the Globe. Whether it did, I do\r\nnot think that we can say. There are one or two references to posts in\r\nstage-directions, but they need not be the posts of the heavens.[343]\r\nPossibly, too, there was less use of the descending chair. One might\r\neven fancy that Jonson’s sarcasm in the prologue to _Every Man In\r\nhis Humour_ discredited it. The new type of play did not so often\r\ncall for spectacular palace scenes, and perhaps some simpler and\r\nmore portable kind of ‘state’ was allowed to serve the turn. There\r\nis no suggestion of a descent from the heavens in the theophanies\r\nof _As You Like It_ and _Pericles_; Juno, however, descends in _The\r\nTempest_.[344] This, although it has practically no change of setting,\r\nis in some ways, under the mask influence, the most spectacular\r\nperformance attempted by the King’s men at Globe or Blackfriars during\r\nour period.[345] But it is far outdone by the Queen’s plays of the\r\n_Golden_, _Silver_, and _Brazen Ages_, which, if they were really\r\ngiven just as Heywood printed them, must have strained the scenic\r\nresources of the Red Bull to an extreme. Here are ascents and descents\r\nand entries from every conceivable point of the stage;[346] divinities\r\nin fantastic disguise;[347] mythological dumb-shows;[348] battles and\r\nhunting episodes and revels;[349] ingenious properties, often with\r\na melodramatic thrill;[350] and from beginning to end a succession\r\nof atmospheric phenomena, which suggest that the Jacobeans had made\r\nconsiderable progress in the art of stage pyrotechnics.[351] The Globe,\r\nwith its traditional ‘blazing star’, is left far behind.[352]\r\n\r\nThe critical points of staging are the recesses below and above.\r\nSome kind of recess on the level of the main stage is often required\r\nby the King’s plays; for action in or before a prison,[353] a\r\ncell,[354] a cave,[355] a closet,[356] a study,[357] a tomb,[358] a\r\nchapel,[359] a shop;[360] for the revelation of dead bodies or other\r\nconcealed sights.[361] In many cases the alcove constructed in the\r\ntiring-house behind the scenic wall would give all that is required,\r\nand occasionally a mention of the ‘curtains’ or of ‘discovery’ in a\r\nstage-direction points plainly to this arrangement. The ‘traverse’ of\r\nWebster’s plays, both for the King’s and the Queen’s men, appears,\r\nas already pointed out, to be nothing more than a terminological\r\nvariant.[362] Similarly, hall scenes have still their ‘arras’ or their\r\n‘hangings’, behind which a spy can post himself.[363] A new feature,\r\nhowever, now presents itself in the existence of certain scenes,\r\nincluding some bedchamber scenes, which entail the use of properties\r\nand would, I think, during the sixteenth century have been placed in\r\nthe alcove, but now appear to have been brought forward and to occupy,\r\nlike hall scenes, the main stage. The usage is by no means invariable.\r\nEven in so late a play as _Cymbeline_, Imogen’s chamber, with Iachimo’s\r\ntrunk and the elaborate fire-places in it, must, in spite of the\r\nabsence of any reference to curtains, have been disposed in the alcove;\r\nfor the trunk scene is immediately followed by another before the door\r\nof the same chamber, from which Imogen presently emerges.[364] But I do\r\nnot think that the alcove was used for Gertrude’s closet in _Hamlet_,\r\nthe whole of which play seems to me to be set very continuously on\r\nthe outer stage.[365] Hamlet does not enter the closet direct from in\r\nfront, but goes off and comes on again. A little distance is required\r\nfor the vision of the Ghost, who goes out at a visible ‘portal’. When\r\nHamlet has killed Polonius, he lugs the guts into the neighbour room,\r\naccording to the ordinary device for clearing a dead body from the\r\nmain stage, which is superfluous when the death has taken place in the\r\nalcove. There is an arras, behind which Polonius esconces himself, and\r\non this, or perhaps on an inner arras disclosed by a slight parting\r\nof the ordinary one, hangs the picture of Hamlet’s father. Nor do I\r\nthink, although it is difficult to be certain, that the alcove held\r\nDesdemona’s death-chamber in _Othello_.[366] True, there are curtains\r\ndrawn here, but they may be only bed-curtains. A longish chamber, with\r\nan outer door, seems to be indicated. A good many persons, including\r\nCassio ‘in a chaire’, have to be accommodated, and when Emilia enters,\r\nit is some time before her attention is drawn to Desdemona behind\r\nthe curtains. If anything is in the alcove, it can only be just the\r\nbed itself. The best illustrations of my point, however, are to be\r\nfound in _The Devil’s Charter_, a singular play, with full and naïve\r\nstage-directions, which perhaps betray the hand of an inexperienced\r\nwriter. Much of the action takes place in the palace of Alexander\r\nBorgia at Rome. The alcove seems to be reserved for Alexander’s study.\r\nOther scenes of an intimately domestic character are staged in front,\r\nand the necessary furniture is very frankly carried on, in one case\r\nby a protagonist. This is a scene in a parlour by night, in which\r\nLucrezia Borgia murders her husband.[367] Another scene represents\r\nLucrezia’s toilet;[368] in a third young men come in from tennis and\r\nare groomed by a barber.[369] My impression is that in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, instead of discovering a bedchamber in the alcove, it became\r\nthe custom to secure more space and light by projecting the bed through\r\nthe central aperture on to the main stage, and removing it by the\r\nsame avenue when the scene was over. As to this a stage-direction in\r\n_2 Henry VI_ may be significant. There was a scene in _1 Contention_\r\nin which the murdered body of the Duke of Gloucester is discovered in\r\nhis bedchamber. This recurs in _2 Henry VI_, but instead of a full\r\ndirection for the drawing of curtains, the Folio has the simple note\r\n‘Bed put forth’.[370] This is one of a group of formulas which have\r\nbeen the subject of some discussion.[371] I do not think that either\r\n‘Bed put forth’ or still less ‘Bed thrust out’ can be dismissed as\r\na mere equivalent of ‘Enter in a bed’, which may admittedly cover a\r\nparting of the curtains, or of such a warning to the tire-man as ‘Bed\r\nset out’ or ‘ready’ or ‘prepared’.[372] There is a difference between\r\n‘setting out’ and ‘thrusting out’, for the one does and the other\r\ndoes not carry the notion of a push. And if ‘Bed put forth’ is rather\r\nmore colourless, ‘Bed drawn out’, which also occurs, is clear enough.\r\nUnfortunately the extant text of _2 Henry VI_ may be of any date up\r\nto 1623, and none of the other examples of the formulas in question\r\nare direct evidence for the Globe in 1599–1613.[373] To be sure of the\r\nprojected bed at so early a date, we have to turn to the Red Bull,\r\nwhere we find it both in the _Golden_ and the _Silver Age_, as well\r\nas the amateur _Hector of Germany_, or to the Swan, where we find it\r\nin _The Chaste Maid of Cheapside_.[374] The _Golden Age_ particularly\r\nrepays study. The whole of the last two acts are devoted to the episode\r\nof Jupiter and Danae. The scene is set in\r\n\r\n                the Darreine Tower\r\n    Guirt with a triple mure of shining brasse.\r\n\r\nMost of the action requires a courtyard, and the wall and gate of this,\r\nwith a porter’s lodge and an alarm-bell, must have been given some kind\r\nof structural representation on the stage. An inner door is supposed to\r\nlead to Danae’s chamber above. It is in this chamber, presumably, that\r\nattendants enter ‘drawing out Danae’s bed’, and when ‘The bed is drawn\r\nin’, action is resumed in the courtyard below.[375]\r\n\r\nThere are chamber scenes in the King’s plays also, which are neither in\r\nthe alcove nor on the main stage, but above. This is an extension of a\r\npractice already observable in pre-Globe days. Hero’s chamber in _Much\r\nAdo about Nothing_ is above.[376] So is Celia’s in _Volpone_.[377] So\r\nis Falstaff’s at the Garter Inn in _The Merry Wives of Windsor_.[378]\r\nIn all these examples, which are not exhaustive, a reasonable amount\r\nof space is required for action.[379] This is still more the case in\r\n_The Yorkshire Tragedy_, where the violent scene of the triple murder\r\nat Calverley Hall is clearly located upstairs.[380] Moreover, there\r\nare two plays which stage above what one would normally regard as hall\r\nrather than chamber scenes. One is _Sejanus_, where a break in the\r\ndialogue in the first act can best be explained by the interpretation\r\nof a scene in an upper ‘gallery’.[381] The other is _Every Man Out\r\nof his Humour_, where the personages go ‘up’ to the great chamber at\r\nCourt.[382] Elaborate use is also made of the upper level in _Antony\r\nand Cleopatra_, where it represents the refuge of Cleopatra upon a\r\nmonument, to which Antony is heaved up for his death scene, and on\r\nwhich Cleopatra is afterwards surprised by Caesar’s troops.[383] But I\r\ndo not agree with the suggestion that it was used in shipboard scenes,\r\nfor which, as we learn from the presenter’s speeches in _Pericles_, the\r\nstage-manager gave up the idea of providing a realistic setting, and\r\nfell back upon an appeal to the imagination of the audience.[384] Nor\r\ndo I think that it was used for the ‘platform’ at Elsinore Castle in\r\n_Hamlet_;[385] or, as it was in the sixteenth century, for scenes in a\r\nCapitoline senate overlooking the forum at Rome.[386] In _Bonduca_, if\r\nthat is of our period, it was adapted for a high rock, with fugitives\r\nupon it, in a wood.[387] I do not find extensive chamber scenes\r\n‘above’ in any King’s play later than 1609, and that may be a fact\r\nof significance to which I shall return.[388] But shallow action, at\r\nwindows or in a gallery overlooking a hall or open space, continues to\r\nbe frequent.[389] In _The Devil is an Ass_, which is a Blackfriars\r\nplay of 1616, a little beyond the limits of our period, there is an\r\ninteresting scene played out of two contiguous upper windows, supposed\r\nto be in different houses.[390]\r\n\r\nThere is other evidence to show that in the seventeenth century as\r\nin the sixteenth, the stage was not limited to the presentation of a\r\nsingle house only at any given moment. A multiplicity of houses would\r\nfit the needs of several plays, but perhaps the most striking instance\r\nfor the Globe is afforded by _The Merry Devil of Edmonton_, the last\r\nact of which requires two inns on opposite sides of the stage, the\r\nsigns of which have been secretly exchanged, as a trick in the working\r\nout of the plot.[391] The King’s plays do not often require any marked\r\nforeshortening of distance in journeys over the stage. Hamlet, indeed,\r\ncomes in ‘a farre off’, according to a stage-direction of the Folio,\r\nbut this need mean no more than at the other end of the graveyard,\r\nalthough Hamlet is in fact returning from a voyage.[392] In _Bonduca_\r\nthe Roman army at one end of the stage are said to be half a furlong\r\nfrom the rock occupied by Caractacus, which they cannot yet see; but\r\nthey go off, and their leaders subsequently emerge upon the rock from\r\nbehind.[393] The old device endured at the Red Bull, but even here the\r\nflagrant example usually cited is of a very special type.[394] At the\r\nend of _The Travels of the Three English Brothers_, the action of\r\nwhich ranges widely over the inhabited world, there is an appeal to\r\nimagination by Fame, the presenter, who says,\r\n\r\n            Would your apprehensions helpe poore art,\r\n    Into three parts deuiding this our stage,\r\n    They all at once shall take their leaues of you.\r\n    Thinke this England, this Spaine, this Persia.\r\n\r\nThen follow the stage-directions, ‘Enter three seuerall waies the\r\nthree Brothers’, and ‘Fame giues to each a prospective glasse, they\r\nseme to see one another’. Obviously such a visionary dumb-show\r\ncannot legitimately be twisted into an argument that the concurrent\r\nrepresentation of incongruous localities was a matter of normal\r\nstaging. Such interplay of opposed houses, as we get in _The Merry\r\nDevil of Edmonton_, would no doubt seem more effective if we could\r\nadopt the ingenious conjecture which regards the scenic wall as not\r\nrunning in a straight line all the way, but broken by two angles, so\r\nthat, while the central apertures below and above directly front the\r\nspectators, the doors to right and left, each with a room or window\r\nabove it, are set on a bias, and more or less face each other from end\r\nto end of the stage.[395] I cannot call this more than a conjecture,\r\nfor there is no direct evidence in its favour, and the Swan drawing,\r\nfor what that is worth, is flatly against it. Structurally it would,\r\nI suppose, fit the round or apsidal ended Globe better than the\r\nrectangular Fortune or Blackfriars. The theory seems to have been\r\nsuggested by a desire to make it possible to watch action within the\r\nalcove from a gallery on the level above. I have not, however, come\r\nacross any play which can be safely assigned to a public theatre, in\r\nwhich just this situation presents itself, although it is common enough\r\nfor persons above to watch action in a threshold or hall scene. Two\r\nwindows in the same plane would, of course, fully meet the needs of\r\n_The Devil is an Ass_. There is, indeed, the often-quoted scene from\r\n_David and Bethsabe_, in which the King watches the Hittite’s wife\r\nbathing at a fountain; but the provenance of _David and Bethsabe_ is\r\nso uncertain and its text so evidently manipulated, that it would be\r\nvery temerarious to rely upon it as affording any proof of public\r\nusage.[396] On the other hand, if it is the case, as seems almost\r\ncertain, that the boxes over the doors were originally the lord’s\r\nrooms, it would no doubt be desirable that the occupants of those\r\nrooms should be able to see anything that went on within the alcove.\r\nI do not quite know what weight to attach to Mr. Lawrence’s analogy\r\nbetween the oblique doors which this theory involves and the familiar\r\npost-Restoration proscenium doors, with stage-boxes above them, at\r\nright angles to the plane of the footlights.[397] The roofed Caroline\r\ntheatres, with their side-walls to the stage, and the proscenium arch,\r\nprobably borrowed from the masks, have intervened, and I cannot pretend\r\nto have traced the history of theatrical structure during the Caroline\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nI have felt justified in dealing more briefly with the early\r\nseventeenth-century stages than with those of the sixteenth century,\r\nfor, after all, the fundamental conditions, so far as I can judge,\r\nremained unaltered. I seem able to lay my finger upon two directions in\r\nwhich development took place, and both of these concern the troublesome\r\nproblem of interior action. First of all there is the stage gallery. Of\r\nthis I venture to reconstruct the story as follows. Its first function\r\nwas to provide seating accommodation for dignified and privileged\r\nspectators, amongst whom could be placed, if occasion arose, presenters\r\nor divine agents supposed to be watching or directing the action of\r\na play. Perhaps a differentiation took place. Parts of the gallery,\r\nabove the doors at either end of the scene, were set aside as lord’s\r\nrooms. The central part, with the upper floor of the tiring-house\r\nbehind it, was used for the musicians, but was also available for such\r\nscenes as could effectively be staged above, and a curtain was fitted,\r\ncorresponding to that below, behind which the recess could be set as\r\na small chamber. Either as a result of these changes or for other\r\nreasons, the lord’s rooms, about the end of the sixteenth century, lost\r\ntheir popularity, and it became the fashion for persons of distinction,\r\nor would-be distinction, to sit upon the stage itself instead.[398]\r\nThis left additional space free above, and the architects of the Globe\r\nand Fortune took the opportunity to enlarge the accommodation for\r\ntheir upper scenes. Probably they left windows over the side-doors, so\r\nthat the upper parts of three distinct houses could, if necessary, be\r\nrepresented; and it may be that spectators were not wholly excluded\r\nfrom these.[399] But they widened the music-room, so that it could now\r\nhold larger scenes, and in fact now became an upper stage and not a\r\nmere recess. Adequate lighting from behind could probably be obtained\r\nrather more easily here than on the crowded floor below. There is an\r\ninteresting allusion which I have not yet quoted, and which seems\r\nto point to an upper stage of substantial dimensions in the public\r\ntheatres of about the year 1607. It is in Middleton’s _Family of Love_,\r\nitself a King’s Revels play.[400] Some of the characters have been to\r\na performance, not ‘by the youths’, and there ‘saw Sampson bear the\r\ntown-gates on his neck from the lower to the upper stage’. You cannot\r\ncarry a pair of town-gates into a mere box, such as the Swan drawing\r\nshows.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what of the alcove? I think that it proved too dark and\r\ntoo cramped for the convenient handling of chamber scenes, and that\r\nthe tendency of the early seventeenth century was to confine its use\r\nto action which could be kept shallow, or for which obscurity was\r\nappropriate. It could still serve for a prison, or an ‘unsunned lodge’,\r\nor a chamber of horrors. For scenes requiring more light and movement\r\nit was replaced, sometimes by the more spacious upper stage, sometimes\r\nby the main stage, on to which beds and other properties were carried\r\nor ‘thrust out’, just as they had always been on a less extensive scale\r\nfor hall scenes. The difficulties of shifting were, on the whole,\r\ncompensated for by the greater effectiveness and visibility which\r\naction on the main scene afforded. I do not therefore think it possible\r\nto accept even such a modified version of the old ‘alternationist’\r\ntheory as I find set out in Professor Thorndike’s recent _Shakespeare’s\r\nTheater_. The older alternationists, starting from the principle, sound\r\nenough in itself, of continuous action within an act, assumed that all\r\ninterior or other propertied scenes were played behind the curtains,\r\nand were set there while unpropertied action was played outside; and\r\nthey deduced a method of dramatic construction, which required the\r\ndramatists to alternate exterior and interior scenes so as to allow\r\ntime for the settings to be carried out.[401] The theory breaks down,\r\nnot merely because it entails a much more constant use of the curtains\r\nthan the stage-directions give us any warrant for, but also because\r\nit fails to provide for the not infrequent event of a succession of\r\ninterior scenes; and in its original form it is abandoned by Professor\r\nThorndike in common with other recent scholars, who see plainly enough\r\nthat what I have called hall scenes must have been given on the outer\r\nstage. I do not think that they have always grasped that the tendency\r\nof the seventeenth century was towards a decreased and not an increased\r\nreliance upon the curtained space, possibly because they have not as\r\na rule followed the historical method in their investigations; and\r\nProfessor Thorndike, although he traces the earlier employment of the\r\nalcove much as I do, treats the opening and closing of the curtains as\r\ncoming in time to be used, in _Antony and Cleopatra_ for example and\r\nin _Cymbeline_, as little more than a handy convention for indicating\r\nthe transference of the scene from one locality to another.[402] Such\r\na usage would not of course mean that the new scene was played wholly\r\nor even partly within the alcove itself; the change might be merely one\r\nof background. But, although I admit that there would be a convenience\r\nin Professor Thorndike’s development, I do not see that there is in\r\nfact any evidence for it. The stage-directions never mention the use\r\nof curtains in such circumstances as he has in mind; and while I am\r\nfar from supposing that they need always have been mentioned, and have\r\nmyself assumed their use in one scene of _Cymbeline_ where they are\r\nnot mentioned, yet mentions of them are so common in connexion with\r\nthe earlier and admitted functions of the alcove, that I should have\r\nexpected Professor Thorndike’s view, if it were sound, to have proved\r\ncapable of confirmation from at least one unconjectural case.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which has led Professor Thorndike to his conclusion\r\nis, however, a real one. In the absence of a _scenario_ with notes\r\nof locality, for which certainly there is no evidence, how did the\r\nElizabethan managers indicate to their audiences the shifts of\r\naction from one place to another? This is both a sixteenth- and a\r\nseventeenth-century problem. We have noted in a former chapter that\r\nunity of place was characteristic of the earlier Elizabethan interlude;\r\nthat it failed to impose itself upon the romantic narrative plots\r\nof the popular drama; that it was departed from through the device\r\nof letting two ends of a continuously set stage stand for discrete\r\nlocalities; that this device proved only a transition to a system in\r\nwhich the whole stage stood successively for different localities;\r\nand that there are hints of a convention by which the locality of\r\neach scene was indicated with the help of a label, placed over the\r\ndoor through which the personages in that scene made their exits and\r\ntheir entrances.[403] The public stage of the sixteenth and early\r\nseventeenth centuries experienced no re-establishment of the principle\r\nof unity; broadly speaking, it presents an extreme type of romantic\r\ndrama, with an unfettered freedom of ranging from one to another of any\r\nnumber of localities required by a narrative plot. But the practice,\r\nor the instinct, of individual playwrights differs. Ben Jonson is\r\nnaturally the man who betrays the most conscious preoccupation with the\r\nquestion. He is not, however, a rigid or consistent unitarian. In his\r\ntwo earliest plays the scene shifts from the country to a neighbouring\r\ntown, and the induction to _Every Man Out of his Humour_ is in part\r\nan apology for his own liberty, in part a criticism of the licence of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n    _Mitis._                               What’s his scene?\r\n\r\n    _Cordatus._ Mary _Insula Fortunata_, sir.\r\n\r\n    _Mitis._ O, the fortunate Iland? masse he has bound himself to a\r\n    strict law there.\r\n\r\n    _Cordatus._ Why so?\r\n\r\n    _Mitis._ He cannot lightly alter the scene without crossing the\r\n    seas.\r\n\r\n    _Cordatus._ He needs not, hauing a whole Ilande to runne through,\r\n    I thinke.\r\n\r\n    _Mitis._ No? howe comes it then, that in some one play we see so\r\n    many seas, countries, and kingdomes, past over with such admirable\r\n    dexteritie?\r\n\r\n    _Cordatus._ O, that but shewes how well the Authors can travaile in\r\n    their vocation, and out-run the apprehension of their Auditorie.\r\n\r\n_Sejanus_ is throughout in Rome, but five or six distinct houses are\r\nrequired, and it must be doubtful whether such a multiplicity of\r\nhouses could be shown without a change of scene.[404] The prologue\r\nto _Volpone_ claims for the author that ‘The laws of time, place,\r\npersons he obserueth’, and this has no more than four houses, all in\r\nVenice.[405] In _Catiline_ the scenes in Rome, with some ten houses,\r\nare broken by two in open country.[406] In _Bartholomew Fair_ a\r\npreliminary act at a London house is followed by four set continuously\r\nbefore the three booths of the fair. Absolute unity, as distinct from\r\nthe unity of a single country, or even a single town, is perhaps only\r\nattained in _The Alchemist_. Here everything takes place, either in a\r\nsingle room in Lovewit’s house in the Blackfriars, or in front of a\r\ndoor leading from the street into the same room. Evidently advantage\r\nwas taken of the fact that the scene did not have to be changed, to\r\nbuild a wall containing this door out on to the stage itself, for\r\naction such as speaking through the keyhole requires both sides of the\r\ndoor to be practicable.[407] There is also a window from which persons\r\napproaching can be seen. Inner doors, presumably in the scenic wall,\r\nlead to a laboratory and other parts of the house, but these are not\r\ndiscovered, and no use is made of the upper level. Jonson here is a\r\nclear innovator, so far as the English public theatre is concerned; no\r\nother play of our period reproduces this type of permanent interior\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nShakespeare is no classicist; yet in some of his plays, comedies and\r\nromantic tragedies, it is, I think, possible to discern at least an\r\ninstinctive feeling in the direction of scenic unity. _The Comedy of\r\nErrors_, with its action in the streets of Syracuse, near the mart,\r\nor before the Phoenix, the Porpentine, or the priory, follows upon\r\nthe lines of its Latin model, although here, as in most of Jonson’s\r\nplays, it is possible that the various houses were shown successively\r\nrather than concurrently. _Twelfth Night_, _Much Ado about Nothing_,\r\nand _Measure for Measure_ each require a single town, with two, three,\r\nand five houses respectively; _Titus Andronicus_, _A Midsummer Night’s\r\nDream_, _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, _As You Like It_, _Troilus and\r\nCressida_, _Timon of Athens_, each a single town, with open country\r\nenvirons. _Love’s Labour’s Lost_ has the unity of a park, with perhaps\r\na manor-house as background at one end and tents at the other; _The\r\nTempest_ complete pastoral unity after the opening scene on shipboard.\r\n_Hamlet_ would all be Elsinore, but for one distant open-country scene;\r\n_Romeo and Juliet_ all Venice, but for one scene in Mantua. In another\r\ngroup of plays the action is divided between two towns. It alternates\r\nfrom Padua to near Verona in _The Taming of the Shrew_, from Verona\r\nto Milan in _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_, from Venice to Belmont in\r\n_The Merchant of Venice_; in _Othello_ an act in Venice is followed\r\nby four in Cyprus. On the other hand, in a few comedies and in the\r\nhistories and historical tragedies, where Shakespeare’s sources leave\r\nhim less discretion, he shifts his scenes with a readiness outdone by\r\nno other playwright. The third act of _Richard II_ requires no less\r\nthan four localities, three of which have a castle, perhaps the same\r\ncastle from the stage-manager’s point of view, in the background. The\r\nsecond act of _1 Henry IV_ has as many. _King John_ and _Henry V_\r\npass lightly between England and France, _All’s Well that Ends Well_\r\nbetween France and Italy, _The Winter’s Tale_ between Sicily and\r\nBohemia, _Cymbeline_ between Britain, Italy, and Wales. Quite a late\r\nplay, _Antony and Cleopatra_, might almost be regarded as a challenge\r\nto classicists. Rome, Misenum, Athens, Actium, Syria, Egypt are the\r\nlocalities, with much further subdivision in the Egyptian scenes. The\r\nsecond act has four changes of locality, the third no less than eight,\r\nand it is noteworthy that these changes are often for quite short\r\nbits of dialogue, which no modern manager would regard as justifying\r\na resetting of the stage. Shakespeare must surely have been in some\r\ndanger, in this case, of outrunning the apprehension of his auditory,\r\nand I doubt if even Professor Thorndike’s play of curtains would have\r\nsaved him.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed also that, in Shakespeare’s plays as in those of\r\nothers, no excessive pains are taken to let the changes of locality\r\ncoincide with the divisions between the acts. If the second and third\r\nacts of _All’s Well that Ends Well_ are at Paris, the fourth at\r\nFlorence, and the fifth at Marseilles, yet the shift from Roussillon\r\nto Paris is in the middle and not at the end of the first act. The\r\nshift from Sicily to Bohemia is in the middle of the third act of\r\n_The Winter’s Tale_; the Agincourt scenes begin in the middle of the\r\nthird act of _Henry V_. Indeed, although the poets regarded the acts\r\nas units of literary structure, the act-divisions do not appear to\r\nhave been greatly stressed, at any rate on the stages of the public\r\nhouses, in the actual presentation of plays.[408] I do not think that\r\nthey were wholly disregarded, although the fact that they are so often\r\nunnoted in the prints of plays based on stage copies might point to\r\nthat conclusion.[409] The act-interval did not necessarily denote\r\nany substantial time-interval in the action of the play, and perhaps\r\nthe actors did not invariably leave the stage. Thus the lovers in _A\r\nMidsummer Night’s Dream_ sleep through the interval between the third\r\nand fourth acts.[410] But some sort of break in the continuity of the\r\nperformance is a natural inference from the fact that the act-divisions\r\nare the favourite, although not the only, points for the intervention\r\nof presenters, dumb-shows, and choruses.[411] The act-intervals cannot\r\nhave been long, at any rate if the performance was to be completed in\r\ntwo hours. There may sometimes have been music, which would not have\r\nprevented the audience from stretching themselves and talking.[412]\r\nShort intervals, rather than none at all, are, I think, suggested by\r\nthe well-known passage in the induction of _The Malcontent_, as altered\r\nfor performance at the Globe, in which it is explained that passages\r\nhave been added to the play as originally written for Revels boys, ‘to\r\nentertain a little more time, and to abridge the not-received custom of\r\nmusic in our theatre’.[413] Some information is perhaps to be gleaned\r\nfrom the ‘plots’ of plays prepared for the guidance of the book-keeper\r\nor tire-man, of which examples are preserved at Dulwich.[414] These\r\nhave lines drawn across them at points which pretty clearly correspond\r\nto the beginnings of scenes, although it can hardly be assumed that\r\neach new scene meant a change of locality. The act-divisions can in\r\nsome, but not all, cases be inferred from the occurrence of dumb-shows\r\nand choruses; in one, _The Dead Man’s Fortune_, they are definitely\r\nmarked by lines of crosses, and against each such line there is the\r\nmarginal note ‘musique’. Other musical directions, ‘sound’, ‘sennet’,\r\n‘alarum’, ‘flourish’, come sometimes at the beginning, sometimes in the\r\nmiddle of scenes.\r\n\r\nWe do not get any encouragement to think that a change of locality was\r\nregularly heralded by notes of music, even if this may incidentally\r\nhave been the case when a procession or an army or a monarch was about\r\nto enter. Possibly the lines on the plots may signify an even slighter\r\npause than that between the acts, such as the modern stage provides\r\nwith the added emphasis of a drop-curtain; but of this there is no\r\nproof, and an allusion in _Catiline_ to action as rapid\r\n\r\n    As is a veil put off, a visor changed,\r\n    Or the scene shifted, in our theatres,\r\n\r\nis distinctly against it.[415] A mere clearance of the stage does\r\nnot necessarily entail a change of scene, although there are one or\r\ntwo instances in which the exit of personages at one door, followed\r\nby their return at another, seems to constitute or accompany such\r\na change.[416] And even if the fact of a change could be signified\r\nin one or other of these ways, the audience would still be in the\r\ndark as to what the new locality was supposed to be. Can we then\r\nassume a continuance of the old practice of indicating localities by\r\nlabels over the doors? This would entail the shifting of the labels\r\nthemselves during the progress of the play, at any rate if there were\r\nmore localities than entrances, or if, as might usually be expected,\r\nmore entrances than one were required to any locality. But there would\r\nbe no difficulty about this, and in fact we have an example of the\r\nshifting of a label by a mechanical device in the introduction to _Wily\r\nBeguiled_.[417] This was not a public theatre play, and the label\r\nconcerned was one giving the title of the play and not its locality,\r\nbut similar machinery could obviously have been applied. There is not,\r\nhowever, much actual evidence for the use either of title-labels or\r\nof locality-labels on the public stage. The former are perhaps the\r\nmore probable of the two, and the practice of posting play-bills at\r\nthe theatre door and in places of public resort would not render\r\nthem altogether superfluous.[418] In favour of locality-labels it is\r\npossible to quote Dekker’s advice to those entering Paul’s, and also\r\nthe praise given to Jonson by Jasper Mayne in _Jonsonus Virbius_:\r\n\r\n    Thy stage was still a stage, two entrances\r\n    Were not two parts o’ the world, disjoined by seas.[419]\r\n\r\nThese, however, are rather vague and inconclusive allusions on which to\r\nbase a whole stage practice, and there is not much to be added to them\r\nfrom the texts and stage-directions of the plays themselves. Signs are\r\nof course used to distinguish particular taverns and shops, just as\r\nthey would be in real life.[420] Occasionally, moreover, a locality is\r\nnamed in a stage-direction in a way that recalls _Common Conditions_,\r\nbut this may also be explained as no more than a descriptive touch such\r\nas is not uncommon in stage-directions written by authors.[421] It is\r\nrather against the theory of labels that care is often taken, when a\r\nlocality is changed, to let the personages themselves declare their\r\nwhereabouts. A careful reader of such rapidly shifting plays as _Edward\r\nI_, _James IV_, _The Battle of Alcazar_, or _King Leir_ will generally\r\nbe able to orientate himself with the aid of the opening passages of\r\ndialogue in each new scene, and conceivably a very attentive spectator\r\nmight do the same. Once the personages have got themselves grouped in\r\nthe mind in relation to their localities, the recurrence of this or\r\nthat group would help. It would require a rather careful examination\r\nof texts to enable one to judge how far this method of localization by\r\ndialogue continues throughout our period. I have been mainly struck by\r\nit in early plays. The presenters may also give assistance, either by\r\ndeclaring the general scene in a prologue, or by intervening to call\r\nattention to particular shifts.[422] Thus in _Dr. Faustus_ the original\r\nscene in Wittenberg is indicated by the chorus, a shift to Rome by\r\nspeeches of Wagner and Faustus, a shift to the imperial court by the\r\nchorus, and the return to Wittenberg by a speech of Faustus.[423]\r\nJonson makes a deliberate experiment with this method in _Every Man Out\r\nof his Humour_, which it is worth while following in detail. It is the\r\nGrex of presenters, Mitis and Cordatus, who serve as guides. The first\r\nact is in open country without background, and it is left to the rustic\r\nSogliardo to describe it (543) as his lordship. A visit to Puntarvolo’s\r\nis arranged, and at the beginning of the second act Cordatus says, ‘The\r\nScene is the countrey still, remember’ (946). Presently the stage is\r\ncleared, with the hint, ‘Here he comes, and with him Signior Deliro\r\na merchant, at whose house hee is come to soiourne. Make your owne\r\nobseruation now; only transferre your thoughts to the Cittie with the\r\nScene; where, suppose they speake’ (1499). The next scene then is at\r\nDeliro’s. Then, for the first scene of the third act, ‘We must desire\r\nyou to presuppose the Stage, the middle Isle in Paules; and that, the\r\nWest end of it’ (1918). The second scene of this act is in the open\r\ncountry again, with a ‘crosse’ on which Sordido hangs himself; we are\r\nleft to infer it from the reappearance of the rustic characters. It is\r\nclosed with ‘Let your minde keepe companie with the Scene stil, which\r\nnow remoues it selfe from the Countrie to the Court’ (2555). After\r\na scene at Court, ‘You vnderstand where the scene is?’ (2709), and\r\npresumably the entry of personages already familiar brings us back for\r\nthe first scene of Act IV to Deliro’s. A visit to ‘the Notaries by the\r\nExchange’ is planned, and for the second and third scenes the only note\r\nis of the entry of Puntarvolo and the Scrivener; probably a scrivener’s\r\nshop was discovered. Act V is introduced by ‘Let your imagination be\r\nswifter than a paire of oares, and by this, suppose Puntarvolo, Briske,\r\nFungoso, and the Dog, arriu’d at the court gate, and going vp to the\r\ngreat chamber’ (3532). The action of the next scene begins in the great\r\nchamber and then shifts to the court gate again. Evidently the two\r\nlocalities were in some way staged together, and a guide is not called\r\nupon to enlighten us. There are yet two more scenes, according to the\r\nGrex. One opens with ‘Conceiue him but to be enter’d the Mitre’ (3841),\r\nand as action shifts from the Mitre to Deliro’s and back again without\r\nfurther note, these two houses were probably shown together. The final\r\nscene is introduced by ‘O, this is to be imagin’d the Counter belike’\r\n(4285). So elaborate a directory would surely render any use of labels\r\nsuperfluous for this particular play; but, so far as we know, the\r\nexperiment was not repeated.[424]\r\n\r\nWhen Cordatus points to ‘that’, and calls it the west end of Paul’s,\r\nare we to suppose that the imagination of the audience was helped out\r\nby the display of any pictorial background? It is not impossible. The\r\ncentral aperture, disclosed by the parting curtains, could easily hold,\r\nin place of a discovered alcove or a quasi-solid monument or rock, any\r\nkind of painted cloth which might give colour to the scene. A woodland\r\ncloth or a battlement cloth could serve for play after play, and for a\r\nspecial occasion something more distinctive could be attempted without\r\nundue expense. Such a back-cloth, perhaps for use in _Dr. Faustus_, may\r\nhave been ‘the sittie of Rome’ which we find in Henslowe’s inventory\r\nof 1598.[425] And something of this kind seems to be required in _2\r\nIf You Know not Me, You Know Nobody_, where the scene is before Sir\r\nThomas Gresham’s newly completed Burse, and the personages say ‘How\r\ndo you like this building?’ and ‘We are gazing here on M. Greshams\r\nwork’.[426] Possibly Elizabethan imaginations were more vivid than a\r\ntradition of scene-painters allows ours to be, but that does not mean\r\nthat an Elizabethan audience did not like to have its eyes tickled\r\nupon occasion. And if as a rule the stage-managers relied mainly upon\r\ngarments and properties to minister to this instinct, there is no\r\nparticular reason why they should not also have had recourse to so\r\nsimple a device as a back-cloth. This conjecture is hardly excluded by\r\nthe very general terms in which post-Restoration writers deny ‘scenes’\r\nand all decorations other than ‘hangings’ to the earlier stage.[427]\r\nBy ‘scenes’ they no doubt mean the complete settings with shuttered\r\n‘wings’ as well as back-cloths which Inigo Jones had devised for the\r\nmasks and the stage had adopted. Even these were not absolutely unknown\r\nin pre-Restoration plays, and neither this fact nor the incidental\r\nuse of special cloths over the central aperture would make it untrue\r\nthat the normal background of an Elizabethan or Jacobean play was an\r\narras.[428]\r\n\r\nThe discussions of the last chapter and a half have envisaged the\r\nplays presented, exclusively in open theatres until the King’s took\r\nover the Blackfriars, by professional companies of men. I must deal\r\nin conclusion, perhaps more briefly than the interest of the problem\r\nwould itself justify, with those of the revived boy companies which for\r\na time carried on such an active rivalry with the men, at Paul’s from\r\n1599 to 1606 and at the Blackfriars from 1600 to 1609. It is, I think,\r\na principal defect of many investigations into Jacobean staging, that\r\nthe identity of the devices employed in the so-called ‘public’ and\r\n‘private’ houses has been too hastily assumed, and a uniform hypothesis\r\nbuilt up upon material taken indifferently from both sources, without\r\nregard to the logical possibility of the considerable divergences to\r\nwhich varying conditions of structure and of tradition may have given\r\nrise. This is a kind of syncretism to which an inadequate respect for\r\nthe historic method naturally tends. It is no doubt true that the\r\n‘standardization’ of type, which I have accepted as likely to result\r\nfrom the frequent migration of companies and plays from one public\r\nhouse to another, may in a less degree have affected the private houses\r\nalso. James Burbadge originally built the Blackfriars for public\r\nperformances, and we know that _Satiromastix_ was produced both at\r\nthe Globe and at Paul’s in 1601, and that in 1604 the Revels boys and\r\nthe King’s men were able to effect mutual piracies of _Jeronimo_ and\r\n_The Malcontent_. Nor is there anything in the general character of\r\nthe two groups of ‘public’ and ‘private’ plays, as they have come down\r\nto us, which is in any obvious way inconsistent with some measure of\r\nstandardization. It is apparent, indeed, that the act-interval was of\r\nfar more importance at both Paul’s and the Blackfriars than elsewhere.\r\nBut this is largely a matter of degree. The inter-acts of music and\r\nsong and dance were more universal and longer.[429] But the relation\r\nof the acts to each other was not essentially different. The break in\r\nthe representation may still correspond to practically no interval\r\nat all in the time-distribution of the play; and there are examples\r\nin which the action continues to be carried on by the personages in\r\ndumb-show, while the music is still sounding.[430] In any case this\r\nparticular distinction, while it might well modify the methods of the\r\ndramatist, need only affect the economy of the tire-house in so far\r\nas it would give more time for the preparation of an altered setting\r\nat the beginning of an act. When _The Malcontent_ was taken over at\r\nthe Globe, the text had to be lengthened that the music might be\r\nabridged, but there is no indication of any further alteration, due to\r\na difficulty in adapting the original situations to the peculiarities\r\nof the Globe stage. The types of incident, again, which are familiar in\r\npublic plays, reappear in the private ones; in different proportions,\r\nno doubt, since the literary interest of the dramatists and their\r\naudiences tends rather in the directions, on the one hand of definite\r\npastoral, and on the other of courtly crime and urban humour, than in\r\nthat of chronicle history. And there is a marked general analogy in\r\nthe stage-directions. Here also those who leave the stage go ‘in’, and\r\nmusic and voices can be heard ‘within’. There are the same formulae\r\nfor the use of several doors, of which one is definitely a ‘middle’\r\ndoor.[431] Spirits and so forth can ‘ascend’ from under the stage by\r\nthe convenient traps.[432] Possibly they can also ‘descend’ from the\r\nheavens.[433] The normal backing of the stage, even in out-of-door\r\nscenes, is an arras or hanging, through which at Paul’s spectators\r\ncan watch a play.[434] At the Blackfriars, while the arras, even more\r\nclearly than in the public theatres, is of a decorative rather than a\r\nrealistic kind, it can also be helped out by something in the nature\r\nof perspective.[435] There is action ‘above’, and interior action,\r\nsome of which is recessed or ‘discovered’. It must be added, however,\r\nthat these formulae, taken by themselves, do not go very far towards\r\ndetermining the real character of the staging. They make their first\r\nappearance, for the most part, with the interludes in which the\r\nCourt influence is paramount, and are handed down as a tradition to\r\nthe public and the private plays alike. They would hardly have been\r\nsufficient, without the Swan drawing and other collateral evidence,\r\nto disclose even such a general conception of the various uses and\r\ninterplay, at the Globe and elsewhere, of main stage, alcove, and\r\ngallery, as we believe ourselves to have succeeded in adumbrating.\r\nAnd it is quite possible that at Paul’s and the Blackfriars they may\r\nnot--at any rate it must not be taken for granted without inquiry that\r\nthey do--mean just the same things. Thus, to take the doors alone, we\r\ninfer with the help of the Swan drawing, that in the public theatres\r\nthe three main entrances were in the scenic wall and on the same or\r\nnearly the same plane. But the Blackfriars was a rectangular room. We\r\ndo not know that any free space was left between its walls and the\r\nsides of the stage. And it is quite conceivable that there may have\r\nbeen side-doors in the planes of these walls, and at right angles to\r\nthe middle door. Whether this was so or not, and if so how far forward\r\nthe side-doors stood, there is certainly nothing in the formulae\r\nof the stage-directions to tell us. Perhaps the most noticeable\r\ndifferentiation, which emerges from a comparative survey of private and\r\npublic plays, is that in the main the writers of the former, unlike\r\nthose of the latter, appear to be guided by the principle of unity\r\nof place; at any rate to the extent that their _domus_ are generally\r\nlocated in the same town, although they may be brought for purposes\r\nof representation into closer contiguity than the actual topography\r\nof that town would suggest. There are exceptions, and the scenes in a\r\ntown are occasionally broken by one or two, requiring at the most an\r\nopen-country background, in the environs. The exact measure in which\r\nthe principle is followed will become sufficiently evident in the\r\nsequel. My immediate point is that it was precisely the absence of\r\nunity of place which drove the public stage back upon its common form\r\nbackground of a curtained alcove below and a curtained gallery above,\r\nsupplemented by the side-doors and later the windows above them, and\r\nconvertible to the needs of various localities in the course of a\r\nsingle play.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to the analysis, first of the Paul’s plays and then\r\nof the Chapel and Revels plays at the Blackfriars; separately, for\r\nthe same caution, which forbids a hasty syncretism of the conditions\r\nof public and private houses, also warns us that divergences may\r\nconceivably have existed between those of the two private houses\r\nthemselves. But here too we are faced with the fact that individual\r\nplays were sometimes transferred from one to the other, _The Fawn_ from\r\nBlackfriars to Paul’s, and _The Trick to Catch the Old One_ in its turn\r\nfrom Paul’s to Blackfriars.[436]\r\n\r\nSeventeen plays, including the two just named and _Satiromastix_, which\r\nwas shared with the Globe, are assigned to Paul’s by contemporary\r\ntitle-pages.[437] To these may be added, with various degrees of\r\nplausibility, _Histriomastix_, _What You Will_, and _Wily Beguiled_.\r\nFor Paul’s were also certainly planned, although we cannot be sure\r\nwhether, or if so when, they were actually produced, the curious\r\nseries of plays left in manuscript by William Percy, of which\r\nunfortunately only two have ever been published. As the company only\r\nendured for six or seven years after its revival, it seems probable\r\nthat a very fair proportion of its repertory has reached us. _Jack\r\nDrum’s Entertainment_ speaks of the ‘mustie fopperies of antiquitie’\r\nwith which the company began its career, and one of these is no doubt\r\nto be found in _Histriomastix_, evidently an old play, possibly of\r\nacademic origin, and recently brought up to date.[438] The staging\r\nof _Histriomastix_ would have caused no difficulty to the Revels\r\nofficers, if it had been put into their hands as a Paul’s play of the\r\n’eighties. The plot illustrates the cyclical progression of Peace,\r\nPlenty, Pride, Envy, War, Poverty, each of whom in turn occupies a\r\nthrone, finally resigned to Peace, for whom in an alternative ending\r\nfor Court performance is substituted Astraea, who is Elizabeth.[439]\r\nThis arrangement recalls that of _The Woman in the Moon_, but the\r\nthrone seems to have its position on the main stage rather than above.\r\nApart from the abstractions, the whole of the action may be supposed\r\nto take place in a single provincial town, largely in an open street,\r\nsometimes in the hall of a lord called Mavortius, on occasion in or\r\nbefore smaller _domus_ representing the studies of Chrisoganus, a\r\nscholar, and Fourcher, a lawyer, the shop of Velure, a merchant, a\r\nmarket-cross, which is discovered by a curtain, perhaps a tavern.[440]\r\nCertainly in the ’eighties these would have been disposed together\r\naround the stage, like the _domus_ of _Campaspe_ about the market-place\r\nat Athens. And I believe that this is in fact how _Histriomastix_ was\r\nstaged, more particularly as at one point (v. 259) the action appears\r\nto pass directly from the street to the hall without a clearance.\r\nSimilarly _The Maid’s Metamorphosis_ is on strictly Lylyan lines. It\r\nis _tout en pastoralle_, in a wood, about whose paths the characters\r\nstray, while in various regions of it are located the cave of Somnus\r\n(II. i. 148), the cottage of Eurymine (IV. ii. 4), and a palace where\r\n‘Phoebus appeares’ (V. ii. 25), possibly above. _Wily Beguiled_ needs\r\na stage of which part is a wood, and part a village hard by, with some\r\nsuggestion of the doors of the houses of Gripe, Ploddall, Churms, and\r\nMother Midnight. Somewhat less concentration is to be found in _The\r\nWisdom of Dr. Dodipoll_. Here too, a space of open country, a green\r\nhill with a cave, the harbourage and a bank, is neighboured by the\r\nCourt of Alphonso and the houses of Cassimere and of Flores, of which\r\nthe last named is adapted for interior action.[441] All this is in\r\nSaxony, but there is also a single short scene (I. iii) of thirty-two\r\nlines, not necessarily requiring a background, in Brunswick. The plays\r\nof William Percy are still, it must be admitted, rather obscure, and\r\none has an uneasy feeling that the manuscript may not yet have yielded\r\nup all its indications as to date and provenance. But on the assumption\r\nthat the conditions contemplated are those of Paul’s in 1599–1606, we\r\nlearn some curious details of structure, and are face to face with a\r\ntechnique which is still closely reminiscent of the ’eighties. Percy,\r\nalone of the dramatists, prefixes to his books, for the guidance of the\r\nproducer, a note of the equipment required to set them forth. Thus for\r\n_Cuckqueans and Cuckolds Errant_ he writes:\r\n\r\n                           ‘The Properties.\r\n\r\n   ‘Harwich, In Midde of the Stage Colchester with Image of\r\n   Tarlton, Signe and Ghirlond under him also. The Raungers Lodge,\r\n   Maldon, A Ladder of Roapes trussed up neare Harwich. Highest and\r\n   Aloft the Title The Cuck-Queanes and Cuckolds Errants. A Long\r\n   Fourme.’\r\n\r\nThe house at Colchester is the Tarlton Inn, and here the ghost of\r\nTarlton prologizes, ‘standing at entrance of the doore and right under\r\nthe Beame’. That at Harwich is the house of Floredin, and the ladder\r\nleads to the window of his wife Arvania. Thus we have the concurrent\r\nrepresentation of three localities, in three distinct towns of Essex.\r\nTo each is assigned one of three doors and, as in _Common Conditions_\r\nof old, entry by a particular door signifies that a scene is to take\r\nplace at the locality to which it belongs.[442] One is at liberty to\r\nconjecture that the doors were nominated by labels, but Percy does not\r\nprecisely say so, although he certainly provides for a title label.\r\nJourneys from one locality to another are foreshortened into a crossing\r\nof the stage.[443] For _The Aphrodysial_ there were at least two\r\nhouses, the palace of Oceanus ‘in the middle and alofte’, and Proteus\r\nHall, where interior action takes place.[444] For _The Faery Pastoral_\r\nthere is an elaborate note:\r\n\r\n                            ‘The Properties\r\n\r\n   ‘Highest, aloft, and on the Top of the Musick Tree the Title The\r\n   Faery Pastorall, Beneath him pind on Post of the Tree The Scene\r\n   Elvida Forrest. Lowest of all over the Canopie ΝΑΠΑΙΤΒΟΔΑΙΟΝ\r\n   or Faery Chappell. A kiln of Brick. A Fowen Cott. A Hollowe\r\n   Oake with vice of wood to shutt to. A Lowe well with Roape and\r\n   Pullye. A Fourme of Turves. A greene Bank being Pillowe to the\r\n   Hed but. Lastly A Hole to creepe in and out.’\r\n\r\nHaving written so far, Percy is smitten with a doubt. The stage of\r\nPaul’s was a small one, and spectators sat on it. If he clutters it up\r\nlike this with properties, will there be room to act at all? He has a\r\nhappy thought and continues:\r\n\r\n   ‘Now if so be that the Properties of any These, that be outward,\r\n   will not serve the turne by reason of concourse of the People\r\n   on the Stage, Then you may omitt the sayd Properties which be\r\n   outward and supplye their Places with their Nuncupations onely\r\n   in Text Letters. Thus for some.’\r\n\r\nWhether the master of Paul’s was prepared to avail himself of this\r\ningenious device, I do not know. There is no other reference to it,\r\nand I do not think it would be safe to assume that it was in ordinary\r\nuse upon either the public or the private stage. There is no change\r\nof locality in _The Faery Pastoral_, which is _tout en pastoralle_,\r\nbut besides the title label, there was a general scenic label and a\r\nspecial one for the fairy chapel. This, which had seats on ‘degrees’\r\n(v. 5), occupied the ‘Canopie, Fane or Trophey’, which I take to\r\nhave been a discovered interior under the ‘Beame’ named in the other\r\nplay, corresponding to the alcove of the public theatres. The other\r\nproperties were smaller ‘practicables’ standing free on the stage,\r\nwhich is presumably what Percy means by ‘outward’. The arrangement must\r\nhave closely resembled that of _The Old Wive’s Tale_. The ‘Fowen Cott’\r\nis later described as ‘tapistred with cats and fowëns’--a gamekeeper’s\r\nlarder. Some kind of action from above was possible; it may have been\r\nonly from a tree.[445]\r\n\r\nThe plays so far considered seem to point to the use at Paul’s of\r\ncontinuous settings, even when various localities had to be shown,\r\nrather than the successive settings, with the help of common form\r\n_domus_, which prevailed at the contemporary Globe and Fortune. Perhaps\r\nthere is rather an archaistic note about them. Let us turn to the\r\nplays written for Paul’s by more up-to-date dramatists, by Marston,\r\nDekker and Webster, Chapman, Middleton, and Beaumont. Marston’s hand,\r\nalready discernible in the revision of _Histriomastix_, appears to be\r\ndominant in _Jack Drum’s Entertainment_, although neither play was\r\nreclaimed for him in the collected edition of 1633. Unity of locality\r\nis not observed in _Jack Drum_. By far the greater part of the action\r\ntakes place on Highgate Green, before the house of Sir Edward Fortune,\r\nwith practicable windows above.[446] But there are two scenes (I.\r\n282–428; IV. 207–56) in London, before a tavern (I. 345), which may be\r\nsupposed to be also the house where Mistress Brabant lies ‘private’ in\r\nan ‘inner chamber’ (IV. 83, 211). And there are three (II. 170–246;\r\nIII. 220–413; V) in an open spot, on the way to Highgate (II. 228)\r\nand near a house, whence a character emerges (III. 249, 310). It is\r\ndescribed as ‘the crosse stile’ (IV. 338), and is evidently quite near\r\nFortune’s house, and still on the green (V. 96, 228). This suggests to\r\nme a staging closely analogous to that of _Cuckqueans and Cuckolds_,\r\nwith Highgate at one end of the stage, London at the other, and the\r\ncross stile between them. It is true that there is no very certain\r\nevidence of direct transference of action from one spot to another,\r\nbut the use of two doors at the beginning of the first London scene is\r\nconsistent, on my theory, with the fact that one entrant comes from\r\nHighgate, whither also he goes at the end of the scene, and the similar\r\nuse at the beginning of the second cross-stile scene is consistent\r\nwith the fact that the two entrants are wildly seeking the same lady,\r\nand one may well have been in London and the other at Highgate. She\r\nherself enters from the neighbouring house; that is to say, a third,\r\ncentral, door. With Marston’s acknowledged plays, we reach an order of\r\ndrama in which interior action of the ‘hall’ type is conspicuous.[447]\r\nThere are four plays, each limited to a single Italian city, Venice\r\nor Urbino. The main action of _1 Antonio and Mellida_ is in the hall\r\nof the doge’s palace, chiefly on ‘the lower stage’, although ladies\r\ndiscourse ‘above’, and a chamber can be pointed to from the hall.[448]\r\nOne short scene (V. 1–94), although near the Court, is possibly in\r\nthe lodging of a courtier, but probably in the open street. And two\r\n(III. i; IV) are in open country, representing ‘the Venice marsh’,\r\nrequiring no background, but approachable by more than one door.[449]\r\nThe setting of _2 Antonio and Mellida_ is a little more complicated.\r\nThere is no open-country scene. The hall recurs and is still the chief\r\nplace of action. It can be entered by more than one door (V. 17,\r\n&c.) and has a ‘vault’ (II. 44) with a ‘grate’ (II. ii. 127), whence\r\na speaker is heard ‘under the stage’ (V. 1). The scenes within it\r\ninclude several episodes discovered by curtains. One is at the window\r\nof Mellida’s chamber above.[450] Another, in Maria’s chamber, where\r\nthe discovery is only of a bed, might be either above or below.[451] A\r\nthird involves the appearance of a ghost ‘betwixt the music-houses’,\r\nprobably above.[452] Concurrently, a fourth facilitates a murder in a\r\nrecess below.[453] Nor is the hall any longer the only interior used.\r\nThree scenes (II. 1–17; III. 1–212; IV. ii) are in an aisle (III.\r\n128) of St. Mark’s, with a trapped grave.[454] As a character passes\r\n(ii. 17) directly from the church to the palace in the course of a\r\nspeech, it is clear that the two ‘houses’, consistently with actual\r\nVenetian topography, were staged together and contiguously. _The Fawn_\r\nwas originally produced at Blackfriars and transferred to Paul’s. I\r\ndeal with it here, because of the close analogy which it presents to\r\n_1 Antonio and Mellida_. It begins with an open-country scene within\r\nsight of the ‘far-appearing spires’ of Urbino. Thereafter all is within\r\nthe hall of the Urbino palace. It is called a ‘presence’ (I. ii. 68),\r\nbut one must conceive it as of the nature of an Italian colonnaded\r\n_cortile_, for there is a tree visible, up which a lover climbs to\r\nhis lady’s chamber, and although both the tree and the chamber window\r\nmight have occupied a bit of façade in the plane of the aperture\r\nshowing the hall, they appear in fact to have been within the hall,\r\nsince the lovers are later ‘discovered’ to the company there.[455]\r\n_What You Will_, intermediate in date between _Antonio and Mellida_\r\nand _The Fawn_, has a less concentrated setting than either of them.\r\nThe principal house is Albano’s (I; III. ii; IV; V. 1–68), where\r\nthere is action at the porch, within the hall, and in a discovered\r\nroom behind.[456] But there are also scenes in a shop (III. ii), in\r\nLaverdure’s lodging (II. ii), probably above, and in a schoolroom (II.\r\nii). The two latter are also discovered.[457] Nevertheless, I do not\r\nthink that shifting scenes of the public theatre type are indicated.\r\nAlbano’s house does not lend itself to public theatre methods. Act I\r\nis beneath his wife Celia’s window.[458] Similarly III. ii is before\r\nhis porch. But III. iv is in his hall, whence the company go to dinner\r\nwithin, and here they are disclosed in V. Hence, from V. 69 onwards,\r\nthey begin to pass to the street, where they presently meet the duke’s\r\ntroop. I do not know of any public play in which the porch, the hall,\r\nand an inner room of a house are all represented, and my feeling is\r\nthat Albano’s occupied the back corner of a stage, with the porch and\r\nwindow above to one side, at right angles to the plane of the hall.\r\nAt any rate I do not see any definite obstacle to the hypothesis that\r\nall Marston’s plays for Paul’s had continuous settings. For _What You\r\nWill_ the ‘little’ stage would have been rather crowded. The induction\r\nhints that it was, and perhaps that spectators were on this occasion\r\nexcluded, while the presenters went behind the back curtains.\r\n\r\nMost of the other Paul’s plays need not detain us as long as Marston’s.\r\nHe has been thought to have helped in _Satiromastix_, but that must\r\nbe regarded as substantially Dekker’s. Obviously it must have been\r\ncapable of representation both at Paul’s and at the Globe. It needs\r\nthe houses of Horace, Shorthose, and Vaughan, Prickshaft’s garden\r\nwith a ‘bower’ in it, and the palace. Interior action is required in\r\nHorace’s study, which is discovered,[459] the presence-chamber at the\r\npalace, where a ‘chaire is set under a canopie’,[460] and Shorthose’s\r\nhall.[461] The ordinary methods at the Globe would be adequate. On the\r\nother hand, London, in spite of Horace, is the locality throughout,\r\nand at Paul’s the setting may have been continuous, just as well as\r\nin _What You Will_. Dekker is also the leading spirit in _Westward\r\nHo!_ and _Northward Ho!_, and in these we get, for the first time at\r\nPaul’s, plays for which a continuous setting seems quite impossible.\r\nNot only does _Westward Ho!_ require no less than ten houses and\r\n_Northward Ho!_ seven, but also, although the greater part of both\r\nplays takes place in London, _Westward Ho!_ has scenes at Brentford\r\nand _Northward Ho!_ at Ware.[462] The natural conclusion is that, for\r\nthese plays at least, the procedure of the public theatres was adopted.\r\nIt is, of course, the combination of numerous houses and changes of\r\nlocality which leads me to this conclusion. Mahelot shows us that the\r\n‘multiple’ staging of the Hôtel de Bourgogne permitted inconsistencies\r\nof locality, but could hardly accommodate more than five, or at most\r\nsix, _maisons_. Once given the existence of alternative methods at\r\nPaul’s, it becomes rather difficult to say which was applied in any\r\nparticular case. Chapman’s _Bussy d’Ambois_ begins, like _The Fawn_,\r\nwith an open-country scene, and thereafter uses only three houses,\r\nall in Paris; the presence-chamber at the palace (I. ii; II. i; III.\r\nii; IV. i), Bussy’s chamber (V. iii), and Tamyra’s chamber in another\r\nhouse, Montsurry’s (II. ii; III. i; IV. ii; V. i, ii, iv). Both\r\nchambers are trapped for spirits to rise, and Tamyra’s has in it a\r\n‘gulfe’, apparently screened by a ‘canopie’, which communicates with\r\nBussy’s.[463] As the interplay of scenes in Act V requires transit\r\nthrough the passage from one chamber to the other, it is natural to\r\nassume an unchanged setting.[464]\r\n\r\nThe most prolific contributor to the Paul’s repertory was Middleton.\r\nHis first play, _Blurt Master Constable_, needs five houses. They are\r\nall in Venice, and as in certain scenes more than one of them appears\r\nto be visible, they were probably all set together.[465] Similarly,\r\n_The Phoenix_ has six houses, all in Ferrara;[466] and _Michaelmas\r\nTerm_ has five houses, all in London.[467] On the other hand, although\r\n_A Mad World, my Masters_ has only four houses,[468] and _A Trick to\r\nCatch the Old One_ seven,[469] yet both these plays resemble Dekker’s,\r\nin that the action is divided between London and one or more places in\r\nthe country; and this, so far as it goes, seems to suggest settings\r\non public theatre lines. I do not know whether Middleton wrote _The\r\nPuritan_, but I think that this play clearly had a continuous setting\r\nwith only four houses, in London.[470] And although Beaumont’s\r\n_Woman Hater_ requires seven houses, these are all within or hard\r\nby the palace in Milan, and action seems to pass freely from one to\r\nanother.[471]\r\n\r\nThe evidence available does not dispose one to dogmatism. But this\r\nis the general impression which I get of the history of the Paul’s\r\nstaging. When the performances were revived in 1599, the master had,\r\nas in the days before Lyly took the boys to Blackfriars, to make the\r\nbest of a room originally designed for choir-practices. This was\r\ncircular, and only had space for a comparatively small stage. At the\r\nback of this, entrance was given by a curtained recess, corresponding\r\nto the alcove of the public theatres, and known at Paul’s as the\r\n‘canopy’.[472] Above the canopy was a beam, which bore the post of the\r\nmusic-tree. On this post was a small stand, perhaps for the conductor\r\nof the music, and on each side of it was a music-house, forming a\r\ngallery,[473] which could represent a window or balcony. There were\r\nat least two other doors, either beneath the music-houses or at right\r\nangles to these, off the sides of the stage. The master began with\r\ncontinuous settings on the earlier sixteenth-century court model, using\r\nthe doors and galleries as far as he could to represent houses, and\r\nsupplementing these by temporary structures; and this plan fitted in\r\nwith the general literary trend of his typical dramatists, especially\r\nMarston, to unity of locality. But in time the romantic element proved\r\ntoo much for him, and when he wanted to enlist the services of writers\r\nof the popular school, such as Dekker, he had to compromise. It may\r\nbe that some structural change was carried out during the enforced\r\nsuspension of performances in 1603. I do not think that there is any\r\nPaul’s play of earlier date which could not have been given in the\r\nold-fashioned manner. In any event, the increased number of houses and\r\nthe not infrequent shiftings of locality from town to country, which\r\nare apparent in the Jacobean plays, seem to me, taken together, to be\r\nmore than can be accounted for on a theory of clumsy foreshortening,\r\nand to imply the adoption, either generally or occasionally, of some\r\nsuch principle of convertible houses, as was already in full swing upon\r\nthe public stage.[474]\r\n\r\nI do not think that the history of the Blackfriars was materially\r\ndifferent from that of Paul’s. There are in all twenty-four plays\r\nto be considered; an Elizabethan group of seven produced by the\r\nChildren of the Chapel, and a Jacobean group of seventeen produced by\r\nthe successive incarnations of the Revels company.[475] Structural\r\nalterations during 1603 are here less probable, for the house only\r\ndated from Burbadge’s enterprise of 1596. Burbadge is said to have\r\nintended a ‘public’ theatre, and it may be argued on _a priori_ grounds\r\nthat he would have planned for the type of staging familiar to him\r\nat the Theatre and subsequently elaborated at the Globe. The actual\r\ncharacter of the plays does not, however, bear out this view. Like\r\nPaul’s, the Blackfriars relied at first in part upon revivals. One was\r\n_Love’s Metamorphosis_, already produced by Lyly under Court conditions\r\nwith the earlier Paul’s boys, and _tout en pastoralle_.[476] Another,\r\nor if not, quite an archaistic play, was _Liberality and Prodigality_,\r\nthe abstract plot of which only needs an equally abstract scene, with\r\na ‘bower’ for Fortune, holding a throne and scaleable by a ladder (30,\r\n290, 903, 932, 953), another ‘bower’ for Virtue (132), an inn (47,\r\n192, 370), and a high seat for a judge with his clerks beneath him\r\n(1245).[477] The two new playwrights may reasonably be supposed to\r\nhave conformed to the traditional methods. Jonson’s _Cynthia’s Revels_\r\nhas a preliminary act of open country, by the Fountain of Self-Love,\r\nin Gargaphia. The rest is all at the Gargaphian palace, either in the\r\npresence, or in an ante-chamber thereto, perhaps before a curtain, or\r\nfor one or two scenes in the nymphs’ chamber (IV. i-v), and in or\r\nbefore the chamber of Asotus (III. v).[478] _Poetaster_ is all at Rome,\r\nwithin and before the palace, the houses of Albius and Lupus, and the\r\nchamber of Ovid.[479] There is certainly no need for any shifting of\r\nscenes so far. Nor does Chapman demand it. _Sir Giles Goosecap_, except\r\nfor one open-country scene, has only two houses, which are demonstrably\r\ncontiguous and used together.[480] _The Gentleman Usher_ has only\r\ntwo houses, supposed to be at a little distance from each other, and\r\nentailing a slight foreshortening, if they were placed at opposite ends\r\nof the stage.[481] _All Fools_ adopts the Italian convention of action\r\nin an open city space before three houses.[482]\r\n\r\nTo the Jacobean repertory not less than nine writers contributed.\r\nChapman still takes the lead with three more comedies and two tragedies\r\nof his own. In the comedies he tends somewhat to increase the number\r\nof his houses, although without any change of general locality.\r\n_M. d’Olive_ has five houses.[483] _May Day_ has four.[484] _The\r\nWidow’s Tears_ has four.[485] But in all cases there is a good deal\r\nof interplay of action between one house and another, and all the\r\nprobabilities are in favour of continuous setting. The tragedies are\r\nperhaps another matter. The houses are still not numerous; but the\r\naction is in each play divided between two localities. The _Conspiracy\r\nof Byron_ is partly at Paris and partly at Brussels; the _Tragedy of\r\nByron_ partly at Paris and partly at Dijon.[486] Jonson’s _Case is\r\nAltered_ has one open-country scene (V. iv) near Milan. The other\r\nscenes require two houses within the city. One is Farneze’s palace,\r\nwith a _cortile_ where servants come and go, and a colonnade affording\r\na private ‘walk’ for his daughters (II. iii; IV. i). Hard by, and\r\nprobably in Italian fashion forming part of the structure of the palace\r\nitself, is the cobbler’s shop of Farneze’s retainer, Juniper.[487]\r\nNear, too, is the house of Jaques, with a little walled backside, and\r\na tree in it.[488] A link with Paul’s is provided by three Blackfriars\r\nplays from Marston. Of these, the _Malcontent_ is in his characteristic\r\nItalian manner. There is a short hunting scene (III. ii) in the middle\r\nof the play. For nearly all the rest the scene is the ‘great chamber’\r\nin the palace at Genoa, with a door to the apartment of the duchess at\r\nthe back (II. i. 1) and the chamber of Malevole visible above.[489]\r\nPart of the last act, however, is before the citadel of Genoa,\r\nfrom which the action passes direct to the palace.[490] _The Dutch\r\nCourtesan_ is a London comedy with four houses, of the same type as\r\n_What You Will_, but less crowded.[491] In the tragedy of _Sophonisba_,\r\non the other hand, we come for the first time at Blackfriars to a\r\npiece which seems hopelessly unamenable to continuous setting. It\r\nrecalls the structure of such early public plays as the _Battle of\r\nAlcazar_. ‘The scene is Libya’, the prologue tells us. We get the\r\ncamps of Massinissa (II. ii), Asdrubal (II. iii), and Scipio (III.\r\nii; V. iv). We get a battle-field with a ‘mount’ and a ‘throne’ in it\r\n(V. ii). We get the forest of Belos, with a cave’s mouth (IV. i). The\r\ncity scenes are divided between Carthage and Cirta. At Carthage there\r\nis a council-chamber (II. i) and also the chamber of Sophonisba (I.\r\nii), where her bed is ‘discovered’.[492] At Cirta there is the similar\r\nchamber of Syphax (III. i; IV. ii) with a trapped altar.[493] A curious\r\nbit of continuous action, difficult to envisage, comprehends this and\r\nthe forest at the junction of Acts IV and V. From a vault within it, a\r\npassage leads to the cave. Down this, in III. i, Sophonisba descends,\r\nfollowed by Syphax. A camp scene intervenes, and at the beginning of IV\r\nSophonisba emerges in the forest, is overtaken by Syphax, and sent back\r\nto Cirta. Then Syphax remembers that ‘in this desert’ lives the witch\r\nErichtho. She enters, and promises to charm Sophonisba to his bed.\r\nQuite suddenly, and without any _Exit_ or other indication of a change\r\nof locality, we are back in the chamber at Cirta. Music sounds within\r\n‘the canopy’ and ‘above’. Erichtho, disguised as Sophonisba, enters the\r\ncanopy, as to bed. Syphax follows, and only discovers his misadventure\r\nat the beginning of Act V.[494] Even if the play was staged as a whole\r\non public theatre methods, it is difficult not to suppose that the two\r\nentrances to the cave, at Cirta and in the forest, were shown together.\r\nIt is to be added that, in a note to the print, Marston apologizes\r\nfor ‘the fashion of the entrances’ on the ground that the play was\r\n‘presented by youths and after the fashion of the private stage’.\r\nSomewhat exceptional also is the arrangement of _Eastward Ho!_, in\r\nwhich Chapman, Jonson, and Marston collaborated. The first three acts,\r\ntaken by themselves, are easy enough. They need four houses in London.\r\nThe most important is Touchstone’s shop, which is ‘discovered’.[495]\r\nThe others are the exteriors of Sir Petronel’s house and Security’s\r\nhouse, with a window or balcony above, and a room in the Blue Anchor\r\ntavern at Billingsgate.[496] But throughout most of Act IV the whole\r\nstage seems to be devoted to a complicated action, for which only one\r\nof these houses, the Blue Anchor, is required. A place above the stage\r\nrepresents Cuckold’s Haven, on the Surrey side of the Thames near\r\nRotherhithe, where stood a pole bearing a pair of ox-horns, to which\r\nbutchers did a folk-observance. Hither climbs Slitgut, and describes\r\nthe wreck of a boat in the river beneath him.[497] It is the boat in\r\nwhich an elopement was planned from the Blue Anchor in Act III. Slitgut\r\nsees passengers landed successively ‘even just under me’, and then at\r\nSt. Katharine’s, Wapping, and the Isle of Dogs. These are three places\r\non the north bank, all to the east of Billingsgate and on the other\r\nside of the Tower, but as each rescue is described, the passengers\r\nenter the stage, and go off again. Evidently a wild foreshortening is\r\ndeliberately involved. Now, although the print obscures the fact, must\r\nbegin a new scene.[498] A night has passed, and Winifred, who landed\r\nat St. Katharine’s, returns to the stage, and is now before the Blue\r\nAnchor.[499] From IV. ii onwards the setting is normal again, with\r\nthree houses, of which one is Touchstone’s. But the others are now\r\nthe exterior of the Counter and of the lodging of Gertrude. One must\r\nconclude that in this play the Blackfriars management was trying an\r\nexperiment, and made complete, or nearly complete, changes of setting,\r\nat the end of Act III and again after IV. i. Touchstone’s, which was\r\ndiscovered, could be covered again. The other houses, except the\r\ntavern, were represented by mere doors or windows, and gave no trouble.\r\nThe tavern, the introduction of which in the early acts already\r\nentailed foreshortening, was allowed to stand for IV. i, and was then\r\nremoved, while Touchstone’s was discovered again.\r\n\r\nMiddleton’s tendency to multiply his houses is noticeable, as at\r\nPaul’s, in _Your Five Gallants_. There are eight, in London, with an\r\nopen-country scene in Combe Park (III. ii, iii), and one cannot be\r\nconfident of continuous setting.[500] But a group of new writers,\r\nenlisted at Blackfriars in Jacobean days, conform well enough to the\r\nold traditions of the house. Daniel’s _Philotas_ has the abstract stage\r\ncharacteristic of the closet tragedies to the type of which it really\r\nbelongs. Any Renaissance façade would do; at most a hall in the court\r\nand the lodging of Philotas need be distinguished. Day’s _Isle of\r\nGulls_ is _tout en pastoralle_.[501] His _Law Tricks_ has only four\r\nhouses, in Genoa.[502] Sharpham’s _Fleir_, after a prelude at Florence,\r\nwhich needs no house, has anything from three to six in London.[503]\r\nFletcher’s _Faithful Shepherdess_, again, is _tout en pastoralle_.[504]\r\nFinally, _The Knight of the Burning Pestle_ is, in the strict sense, an\r\nexception which proves the rule. Its shifts of locality are part of the\r\nburlesque, in which the popular plays are taken off for the amusement\r\nof the select audience of the Blackfriars. Its legitimate houses are\r\nonly two, Venturewell’s shop and Merrithought’s dwelling, hard by one\r\nanother.[505] But the adventures of the prentice heroes take them not\r\nonly over down and through forest to Waltham, where the Bell Inn must\r\nserve for a knightly castle, and the barber’s shop for Barbaroso’s\r\ncave, but also to the court of Moldavia, although the players regret\r\nthat they cannot oblige the Citizen’s Wife by showing a house covered\r\nwith black velvet and a king’s daughter standing in her window all in\r\nbeaten gold, combing her golden locks with a comb of ivory.[506] What\r\nvisible parody of public stage methods heightened the fun, it is of\r\ncourse impossible to say.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to follow the Queen’s Revels to the Whitefriars, or\r\nto attempt any investigation into the characteristics of that house.\r\nIt was occupied by the King’s Revels before the Queen’s Revels, and\r\nprobably the Lady Elizabeth’s joined the Queen’s Revels there at a\r\nlater date. But the number of plays which can definitely be assigned\r\nto it is clearly too small to form the basis of any satisfactory\r\ninduction.[507] So far as the Blackfriars is concerned, my conclusion\r\nmust be much the same as for Paul’s--that, when plays began in 1600,\r\nthe Chapel revived the methods of staging with which their predecessors\r\nhad been familiar during the hey-day of the Court drama under Lyly;\r\nthat these methods held their own in the competition with the public\r\ntheatres, and were handed on to the Queen’s Revels; but that in\r\ncourse of time they were sometimes variegated by the introduction,\r\nfor one reason or another, of some measure of scene-shifting in\r\nindividual plays. This reason may have been the nature of the plot\r\nin _Sophonisba_, the desire to experiment in _Eastward Ho!_, the\r\nrestlessness of the dramatist in _Your Five Gallants_, the spirit of\r\nraillery in _The Knight of the Burning Pestle_. Whether Chapman’s\r\ntragedies involved scene-shifting, I am not quite sure. The analogy of\r\nthe Hôtel de Bourgogne, where a continuous setting was not inconsistent\r\nwith the use of widely distant localities, must always be kept in mind.\r\nOn the other hand, what did not appear absurd in Paris, might have\r\nappeared absurd in London, where the practice of the public theatres\r\nhad taught the spectators to expect a higher degree of consistency.\r\nI am far from claiming that my theory of the survival of continuous\r\nsetting at Paul’s and the Blackfriars has been demonstrated. Very\r\npossibly the matter is not capable of demonstration. Many, perhaps\r\nmost, of the plays could be produced, if need be, by alternative\r\nmethods. It is really on taking them in the mass that I cannot resist\r\nthe feeling that ‘the fashion of the private stage’, as Marston called\r\nit, was something different from the fashion of the public stage. The\r\ntechnique of the dramatists corresponds to the structural conditions.\r\nAn increased respect for unity of place is not the only factor,\r\nalthough it is the most important. An unnecessary multiplicity of\r\nhouses is, except by Dekker and Middleton, avoided. Sometimes one or\r\ntwo suffice. There is much more interior action than in the popular\r\nplays. One hall or chamber scene can follow upon another more freely.\r\nA house may be used for a scene which would seem absurdly short if the\r\nsetting were altered for it. More doors are perhaps available, so that\r\nsome can be spared for entrance behind the houses. There is more coming\r\nand going between one house and another, although I have made it clear\r\nthat even the public stage was not limited to one house at a time.[508]\r\nOne point is, I think, quite demonstrable. Marston has a reference\r\nto ‘the lower stage’ at Paul’s, but neither at Paul’s nor at the\r\nBlackfriars was there an upper stage capable of holding the action of\r\na complete scene, such as we found at the sixteenth-century theatres,\r\nand apparently on a still larger scale at the Globe and the Fortune.\r\nA review of my notes will show that, although there is action ‘above’\r\nin many private house plays, it is generally a very slight action,\r\namounting to little more than the use by one or two persons of a window\r\nor balcony. Bedchamber scenes or tavern scenes are provided for below;\r\nthe public theatre, as often as not, put them above.[509] I may recall,\r\nin confirmation, that the importance of the upper stage in the plays\r\nof the King’s men sensibly diminishes after their occupation of the\r\nBlackfriars.[510]\r\n\r\nThere are enigmas still to be solved, and I fear insoluble. Were the\r\ncontinuous settings of the type which we find in Serlio, with the unity\r\nof a consistent architectural picture, or of the type which we find\r\nat the Hôtel de Bourgogne, with independent and sometimes incongruous\r\njuxtaposed _mansions_? The taste of the dramatists for Italian cities\r\nand the frequent recurrence of buildings which fit so well into a\r\nSerliesque scheme as the tavern, the shop, the house of the _ruffiana_\r\nor courtesan, may tempt one’s imagination towards the former. But\r\nSerlio does not seem to contemplate much interior action, and although\r\nthe convention of a half out-of-doors _cortile_ or _loggia_ may help\r\nto get over this difficulty, the often crowded presences and the masks\r\nseem to call for an arrangement by which each _mansion_ can at need\r\nbecome in its turn the background to the whole of the stage and attach\r\nto itself all the external doors. How were the open-country scenes\r\nmanaged, which we have noticed in several plays, as a prelude, or even\r\nan interruption, to the strict unity of place?[511] Were these merely\r\nplayed on the edge of the stage, or are we to assume a curtain, cutting\r\noff the background of houses, and perhaps painted with an open-country\r\nor other appropriate perspective? And what use, if any, can we suppose\r\nto have been made of title or locality labels? The latter would not\r\nhave had much point where the locality was unchanged; but Envy calls\r\nout ‘Rome’ three times in the prologue to the _Poetaster_, as if she\r\nsaw it written up in three places. Percy may more naturally use them in\r\n_Cuckqueans and Cuckolds_, on a stage which represents a foreshortening\r\nof the distance between three distinct towns. Title-labels seem fairly\r\nprobable. _Cynthia’s Revels_ and _The Knight of the Burning Pestle_\r\nbear testimony to them at the Blackfriars; _Wily Beguiled_ perhaps at\r\nPaul’s.[512] And if the prologues none the less thought it necessary\r\nto announce ‘The scene is Libya’, or ‘The scene Gargaphia, which I do\r\nvehemently suspect for some fustian country’, why, we must remember\r\nthat there were many, even in a select Elizabethan audience, that could\r\nnot hope to be saved by their book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK V\r\n\r\n                         PLAYS AND PLAYWRIGHTS\r\n\r\n   Tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,\r\n   historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,\r\n   tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable or poem\r\n   unlimited.--_Hamlet._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXII\r\n\r\n                         THE PRINTING OF PLAYS\r\n\r\n   [_Bibliographical Note._--The records of the Stationers’ Company\r\n   were utilized by W. Herbert in _Typographical Antiquities_\r\n   (1785–90), based on an earlier edition (1749) by J. Ames,\r\n   and revised, but not for the period most important to us, by\r\n   T. F. Dibdin (1810–19). They are now largely available at\r\n   first hand in E. Arber, _Transcript of the Registers of the\r\n   Stationers’ Company, 1554–1640_ (1875–94), and G. E. B. Eyre,\r\n   _Transcript of the Registers of the Worshipful Company of\r\n   Stationers, 1640–1708_ (1913–14). Recent investigations are to\r\n   be found in the _Transactions_ and other publications of the\r\n   Bibliographical Society, and in the periodicals _Bibliographica_\r\n   and _The Library_. The best historical sketches are H. R.\r\n   Plomer, _A Short History of English Printing_ (1900), E. G.\r\n   Duff, _The Introduction of Printing into England_ (1908, _C.\r\n   H._ ii. 310), H. G. Aldis, _The Book-Trade, 1557–1625_ (1909,\r\n   _C. H._ iv. 378), and R. B. McKerrow, _Booksellers, Printers,\r\n   and the Stationers’ Trade_ (1916, _Sh. England_, ii. 212). Of\r\n   somewhat wider range is H. G. Aldis, _The Printed Book_ (1916).\r\n   Records of individual printers are in E. G. Duff, _A Century\r\n   of the English Book Trade, 1457–1557_ (1905), R. B. McKerrow,\r\n   _Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers, 1557–1640_ (1910), and\r\n   H. R. Plomer, _Dictionary of Booksellers and Printers, 1641–67_\r\n   (1907). Special studies of value are R. B. McKerrow, _Printers\r\n   and Publishers’ Devices_ (1913), and _Notes on Bibliographical\r\n   Evidence for Literary Students_ (1914). P. Sheavyn, _The\r\n   Literary Profession in the Elizabethan Age_ (1909), is not very\r\n   accurate. The early history of the High Commission (1558–64) is\r\n   studied in H. Gee, _The Elizabethan Clergy and the Settlement of\r\n   Religion_ (1898). The later period awaits fuller treatment than\r\n   that in _An Account of the Courts Ecclesiastical_ by W. Stubbs\r\n   in the _Report of the Commission on Ecclesiastical Courts_\r\n   (1883), i. 21. J. S. Burn, _The High Commission_ (1865), is\r\n   scrappy.\r\n\r\n   For plays in particular, W. W. Greg, _List of English Plays_\r\n   (1900), gives the title-pages, and Arber the registration\r\n   entries. Various problems are discussed by A. W. Pollard,\r\n   _Shakespeare Folios and Quartos_ (1909) and _Shakespeare’s Fight\r\n   with the Pirates_ (1917, ed. 2, 1920), and in connexion with\r\n   the Shakespearian quartos of 1619 (cf. ch. xxiii). New ground\r\n   is opened by A. W. Pollard and J. D. Wilson, _The ‘Stolne and\r\n   Surreptitious’ Shakespearian Texts_ (_T. L. S._ Jan.–Aug. 1919),\r\n   and J. D. Wilson, _The Copy for Hamlet, 1603, and the Hamlet\r\n   Transcript, 1593_ (1918). Other studies are C. Dewischeit,\r\n   _Shakespeare und die Stenographie_ (1898, _Jahrbuch_, xxxiv.\r\n   170), B.

Bayfield, _Shakespeare’s Versification_ (1920); cf.\r\n   _T. L. S._ (1919–20).\r\n\r\n   The nature of stage-directions is considered in many works on\r\n   staging (cf. _Bibl. Note_ to ch. xviii), and in N. Delius,\r\n   _Die Bühnenweisungen in den alten Shakespeare-Ausgaben_ (1873,\r\n   _Jahrbuch_, viii. 171), R. Koppel, _Scenen-Einteilung und\r\n   Orts-Angaben in den Shakespeareschen Dramen_ (1874, _Jahrbuch_,\r\n   ix. 269), _Die unkritische Behandlung dramaturgischer Angaben\r\n   und Anordnungen in den Shakespeare-Ausgaben_ (1904, _E. S._\r\n   xxxiv. 1). The documents printed by Arber are so fundamental as\r\n   to justify a short description. Each of his vols. i-iv gives the\r\n   text, or most of the text, of four books, lettered A-D in the\r\n   Company’s archives, interspersed with illustrative documents\r\n   from other sources; vol. v consists of indices. Another series\r\n   of books, containing minutes of the Court of Assistants from\r\n   1603 onwards, remains unprinted (ii. 879). Book A contains the\r\n   annual accounts of the wardens from 1554 to 1596. The Company’s\r\n   year began on varying dates in the first half of July. From\r\n   1557 to 1571 the accounts include detailed entries of the books\r\n   for which fees were received and of the fines imposed upon\r\n   members of the Company for irregularities. Thereafter they are\r\n   abstracts only, and reference is made for the details of fees\r\n   to ‘the register in the clarkes booke’ (i. 451). Unfortunately\r\n   this book is not extant for 1571–6. After the appointment of\r\n   Richard Collins in place of George Wapull as clerk in 1575, a\r\n   new ‘booke of entrances’ was bought for the clerk (i. 475).\r\n   This is Book B, which is divided into sections for records of\r\n   different character, including book entries for 1576–95, and\r\n   fines for 1576–1605. There are also some decrees and ordinances\r\n   of the Court, most of which Arber does not print, and a few\r\n   pages of miscellaneous memoranda at the beginning and end (ii.\r\n   33–49, 884–6). Book C, bought ‘for the entrance of copies’ in\r\n   1594–5 (i. 572), has similar memoranda (iii. 35–8, 677–98). It\r\n   continues the book entries, and these alone, for 1595–1620. Book\r\n   D continues them for 1620–45. Arber’s work stops at 1640. Eyre\r\n   prints a transcript by H. R. Plomer of the rest of D and of\r\n   Books E, F, and G, extending to 1708.]\r\n\r\nA historian of the stage owes so much of his material to the printed\r\ncopies of plays, with their title-pages, their prefatory epistles, and\r\ntheir stage-directions, that he can hardly be dispensed from giving\r\nsome account of the process by which plays got into print. Otherwise\r\nI should have been abundantly content to have left the subject with a\r\nreference to the researches of others, and notably of that accomplished\r\nbibliographer, my friend Mr. A. W. Pollard, to whom in any event the\r\ndebt of these pages must be great. The earliest attempts to control\r\nthe book-trade are of the nature of commercial restrictions, and\r\nconcern themselves with the regulation of alien craftsmanship.[513]\r\nBut when Tudor policy had to deal with expressions of political and\r\nreligious opinion, and in particular when the interlude as well as the\r\npamphlet, not without encouragement from Cranmer and Cromwell, became\r\nan instrument of ecclesiastical controversy, it was not long before the\r\nState found itself committed to the methods of a literary censorship.\r\nWe have already followed in detail the phases of the control to which\r\nthe spoken play was subjected.[514] The story of the printed play\r\nwas closely analogous; and in both cases the ultimate term of the\r\nevolution, so far as our period is concerned, was the establishment of\r\nthe authority of the Master of the Revels. The printing and selling\r\nof plays, however, was of course only one fragment of the general\r\nbusiness of book-production. Censorship was applied to many kinds of\r\nbooks, and was also in practice closely bound up with the logically\r\ndistinct problem of copyright. This to the Elizabethan mind was a\r\nprinciple debarring one publisher from producing and selling a book in\r\nwhich another member of his trade had already a vested interest. The\r\nconception of a copyright vested in the author as distinct from the\r\npublisher of a book had as yet hardly emerged.\r\n\r\nThe earliest essay in censorship in fact took the form of an extension\r\nof the procedure, under which protection had for some time past been\r\ngiven to the copyright in individual books through the issue of a\r\nroyal privilege forbidding their republication by any other than the\r\nprivileged owner or printer.[515] Three proclamations of Henry VIII\r\nagainst heretical or seditious books, in 1529, 1530, and 1536, were\r\nfollowed in 1538 by a fourth, which forbade the printing of any English\r\nbook except with a licence given ‘upon examination made by some of his\r\ngracis priuie counsayle, or other suche as his highnes shall appoynte’,\r\nand further directed that a book so licensed should not bear the words\r\n‘Cum priuilegio regali’ without the addition of ‘ad imprimendum solum’,\r\nand that ‘the hole copie, or els at the least theffect of his licence\r\nand priuilege be therwith printed’.[516] The intention was apparently\r\nto distinguish between a merely regulative privilege or licence to\r\nprint, and the older and fuller type of privilege which also conveyed\r\na protection of copyright. Finally, in 1546, a fifth proclamation\r\nlaid down that every ‘Englishe boke, balet or playe’ must bear the\r\nnames of the printer and author and the ‘daye of the printe’, and that\r\nan advance copy must be placed in the hands of the local mayor two\r\ndays before publication.[517] It is not quite clear whether these\r\nrequirements were intended to replace, or merely to reinforce, that of\r\na licence. Henry’s proclamations lost their validity upon his death\r\nin 1547, but the policy of licensing was continued by his successors.\r\nUnder Edward VI we get, first a Privy Council order of 1549, directing\r\nthat all English books printed or sold should be examined and allowed\r\nby ‘M^r Secretary Peter, M^r Secretary Smith and M^r Cicill, or the\r\none of them’, and secondly a proclamation of 1551, requiring allowance\r\n‘by his maiestie, or his priuie counsayl in writing signed with his\r\nmaiesties most gratious hand or the handes of sixe of his sayd priuie\r\ncounsayl’.[518] Mary in her turn, though with a different emphasis\r\non the kind of opinion to be suppressed, issued three proclamations\r\nagainst heretical books in 1553, 1555, and 1558, and in the first of\r\nthese limited printers to books for which they had ‘her graces speciall\r\nlicence in writynge’.[519] It is noteworthy that both in 1551 and in\r\n1553 the printing and the playing of interludes were put upon exactly\r\nthe same footing.\r\n\r\nMary, however, took another step of the first importance for the\r\nfurther history of publishing, by the grant on 4 May 1557 a charter of\r\nincorporation to the London Company of Stationers.[520] This was an\r\nold organization, traceable as far back as 1404.[521] By the sixteenth\r\ncentury it had come to include the printers who manufactured, as\r\nwell as the stationers who sold, books; and many, although not all\r\nof its members, exercised both avocations. No doubt the issue of the\r\ncharter had its origin in mixed motives. The stationers wanted the\r\nstatus and the powers of economic regulation within their trade which\r\nit conferred; the Government wanted the aid of the stationers in\r\nestablishing a more effective control over the printed promulgation of\r\ninconvenient doctrines. This preoccupation is clearly manifested in the\r\npreamble to the charter, with its assertion that ‘seueral seditious\r\nand heretical books’ are ‘daily published’; and the objects of both\r\nparties were met by a provision that ‘no person shall practise or\r\nexercise the art or mystery of printing or stamping any book unless\r\nthe same person is, or shall be, one of the society of the foresaid\r\nmystery of a stationer of the city aforesaid, or has for that purpose\r\nobtained our licence’. This practically freed the associated stationers\r\nfrom any danger of outside competition, and it immensely simplified\r\nthe task of the heresy hunters by enlisting the help of the Company\r\nagainst the establishment of printing-presses by any but well-known\r\nand responsible craftsmen. Registration is always half-way towards\r\nregulation. The charter did not, however, dispense, even for the\r\nmembers of the Company, with the requirement of a licence; nor did it\r\ngive the Company any specific functions in connexion with the issue of\r\nlicences, and although Elizabeth confirmed her sister’s grant on 10\r\nNovember 1559, she had already, in the course of the ecclesiastical\r\nsettlement earlier in the year, taken steps to provide for the\r\ncontinuance of the old system, and specifically laid it down that\r\nthe administration of the Company was to be subordinate thereto. The\r\nlicensing authority rested ultimately upon the _Act of Supremacy_, by\r\nwhich the power of ecclesiastical jurisdiction for the ‘reformation,\r\norder, and correction’ of all ‘errors, heresies, schisms, abuses,\r\noffences, contempts, and enormities’ was annexed to the Crown, and the\r\nCrown was authorized to exercise its jurisdiction through the agency of\r\na commission appointed under letters patent.[522] This Act received the\r\nroyal assent on 8 May 1559, together with the _Act of Uniformity_ which\r\nestablished the Book of Common Prayer, and made it an offence ‘in any\r\ninterludes, plays, songs, rhymes, or by other open words’ to ‘declare\r\nor speak anything in the derogation, depraving, or despising’ of that\r\nbook.[523] In the course of June followed a body of _Injunctions_,\r\nintended as a code of ecclesiastical discipline to be promulgated at\r\na series of diocesan visitations held by commissioners under the _Act\r\nof Supremacy_. One of these _Injunctions_ is directly concerned with\r\nthe abuses of printers of books.[524] It begins by forbidding any book\r\nor paper to be printed without an express written licence either from\r\nthe Queen herself or from six of the Privy Council, or after perusal\r\nfrom two persons being either the Archbishop of Canterbury or York, the\r\nBishop of London, the Chancellor of Oxford or Cambridge, or the Bishop\r\nor Archdeacon for the place of printing. One of the two must always be\r\nthe Ordinary, and the names of the licensers are to be ‘added in the\r\nend’ of every book. This seems sufficiently to cover the ground, but\r\nthe _Injunction_ goes on to make a special reference to ‘pamphlets,\r\nplays and ballads’, from which anything ‘heretical, seditious, or\r\nunseemly for Christian ears’ ought to be excluded; and for these it\r\nprescribes a licence from ‘such her majesty’s commissioners, or three\r\nof them, as be appointed in the city of London to hear and determine\r\ndivers causes ecclesiastical’. These commissioners are also to punish\r\nbreaches of the _Injunction_, and to take and notify an order as\r\nto the prohibition or permission of ‘all other books of matters of\r\nreligion or policy, or governance’. An exemption is granted for books\r\nordinarily used in universities or schools. The Master and Wardens\r\nof the Stationers’ Company are ‘straitly’ commanded to be obedient\r\nto the _Injunction_. The commission here referred to was not one of\r\nthose entrusted with the diocesan visitations, but a more permanent\r\nbody sitting in London itself, which came to be known as the High\r\nCommission. The reference to it in the _Injunction_ reads like an\r\nafterthought, but as the principal members of this commission were\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, there is not\r\nso much inconsistency between the two forms of procedure laid down as\r\nmight at first sight appear. The High Commission was not in fact yet in\r\nexistence when the _Injunctions_ were issued, but it was constituted\r\nunder a patent of 19 July 1559, and was renewed from time to time by\r\nfresh patents throughout the reign.[525] The original members, other\r\nthan the two prelates, were chiefly Privy Councillors, Masters of\r\nRequests, and other lawyers. The size of the body was considerably\r\nincreased by later patents, and a number of divines were added. The\r\npatent of 1559 conferred upon the commissioners a general power to\r\nexercise the royal jurisdiction in matters ecclesiastical. It does not\r\nrepeat in terms the provisions for the ‘allowing’ of books contained\r\nin the _Injunctions_, but merely recites that ‘divers seditious books’\r\nhave been set forth, and empowers the commissioners to inquire into\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe _Injunctions_ and the Commission must be taken as embodying the\r\nofficial machinery for the licensing of books up to the time of\r\nthe well-known Star Chamber order of 1586, although the continued\r\nanxiety of the government in the matter is shown by a series of\r\nproclamations and orders which suggest that no absolutely effective\r\nmethod of suppressing undesirable publications had as yet been\r\nattained.[526] Mr. Pollard, who regards the procedure contemplated\r\nby the _Injunctions_ as ‘impossible’, believes that in practice the\r\nStationers’ Company, in ordinary cases, itself acted as a licensing\r\nauthority.[527] Certainly this is the testimony, as regards the\r\nperiod 1576–86, of a note of Sir John Lambe, Dean of the Arches, in\r\n1636, which is based wholly or in part upon information derived from\r\nFelix Kingston, then Master of the Company.[528] Kingston added the\r\ndetail that in the case of a divinity book of importance the opinion\r\nof theological experts was taken. Mr. Pollard expresses a doubt\r\nwhether Lambe or Kingston had much evidence before them other than\r\nthe registers of the Company which are still extant, and to these we\r\nare in a position to turn for confirmation or qualification of their\r\nstatements.[529] Unfortunately, the ordinances or constitutions under\r\nwhich the master and wardens acted from the time of the incorporation\r\nhave not been preserved, and any additions made to these by the Court\r\nof Assistants before the Restoration have not been printed.[530] We\r\nhave some revised ordinances of 1678–82, and these help us by recording\r\nas of ‘ancient usage’ a practice of entering all publications, other\r\nthan those under letters patent, in ‘the register-book of this\r\ncompany’.[531] It is in fact this register, incorporated from 1557 to\r\n1571 in the annual accounts of the wardens and kept from 1576 onwards\r\nas a subsidiary book by the clerk, which furnishes our principal\r\nmaterial. During 1557–71 the entries for each year are collected\r\nunder a general heading, which takes various forms. In 1557–8 it is\r\n‘The entrynge of all such copyes as be lycensed to be prynted by the\r\nmaster and wardyns of the mystery of stacioners’; in 1558–9 simply\r\n‘Lycense for pryntinge’; in 1559–60, for which year the entries are\r\nmixed up with others, ‘Receptes for fynes, graunting of coppyes and\r\nother thynges’; in 1560–1 ‘For takynge of fynes for coppyes’. This\r\nformula lasts until 1565–6, when ‘The entrynge of coopyes’ takes its\r\nplace. The wording of the individual entries also varies during the\r\nperiod, but generally it indicates the receipt of a money payment in\r\nreturn for a license.[532] In a very few cases, by no means always\r\nof divinity books, the licence is said to be ‘by’, or the licence or\r\nperhaps the book itself, to be ‘authorized’ or ‘allowed’ or ‘perused’\r\nor ‘appointed’ by the Bishop of London; still more rarely by the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury or by both prelates; once by the Archbishops\r\nof Canterbury and York; once by the Council.[533]\r\n\r\nRichard Collins, on his appointment as Clerk of the Company in 1575,\r\nrecords that one of his duties was to enter ‘lycences for pryntinge\r\nof copies’ and one section of his register is accordingly devoted to\r\nthis purpose.[534] It has no general heading, but the summary accounts\r\nof the wardens up to 1596 continue to refer to the receipts as ‘for\r\nlicencinge of copies’.[535] The character of the individual entries\r\nbetween 1576 and 1586 is much as in the account books. The name of\r\na stationer is given in the margin and is followed by some such\r\nformula as ‘Receyved of him for his licence to prynte’ or more briefly\r\n‘Lycenced vnto him’, with the title of the book, any supplementary\r\ninformation which the clerk thought relevant, and a note of the payment\r\nmade. Occasional alternatives are ‘Allowed’, ‘Admitted’, ‘Graunted’\r\nor ‘Tolerated’ ‘vnto him’, of which the three first appear to have\r\nbeen regarded as especially appropriate to transfers of existing\r\ncopyrights;[536] and towards the end of the period appears the more\r\nimportant variant ‘Allowed vnto him for his copie’.[537] References\r\nto external authorizers gradually become rather more frequent,\r\nalthough they are still the exception and not the rule; the function\r\nis fulfilled, not only by the bishop, the archbishop, or the Council,\r\nbut also upon occasion by the Lord Chancellor or the Secretary, by\r\nindividual Privy Councillors, by the Lord Mayor, the Recorder or the\r\nRemembrancer of the City, and by certain masters and doctors, who\r\nmay be the ministers mentioned by Felix Kingston, and who probably\r\nheld regular deputations from a proper ecclesiastical authority as\r\n‘correctors’ to the printers.[538] It is certain that such a post was\r\nheld in 1571 by one Talbot, a servant of the Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\nOn the other hand the clerk, at first tentatively and then as a matter\r\nof regular practice, begins to record the part taken by the master and\r\nwardens. The first example is a very explicit entry, in which the book\r\nis said to be ‘licensed to be printed’ by the archbishop and ‘alowed’\r\nby the master and a warden.[539] But the formula which becomes normal\r\ndoes not dwell on any differentiation of functions, and merely states\r\nthe licence as being ‘under the hands of’ the wardens or of one of them\r\nor the master, or of these and of some one who may be presumed to be\r\nan external corrector. To the precise significance of ‘under the hands\r\nof’ I must return. Increased caution with regard to dangerous books\r\nis also borne witness to during this period by the occasional issue\r\nof a qualified licence. In 1580 Richard Jones has to sign his name\r\nin the register to a promise ‘to bring the whole impression’ of _The\r\nLabyrinth of Liberty_ ‘into the Hall in case it be disliked when it\r\nis printed’.[540] In 1583 the same stationer undertakes ‘to print of\r\nhis own perill’.[541] In 1584 it is a play which is thus brought into\r\nquestion, Lyly’s _Sapho and Phao_, and Thomas Cadman gets no more than\r\n‘yt is graunted vnto him yat yf he gett ye commedie of Sappho laufully\r\nalowed vnto him, then none of this cumpanie shall interrupt him to\r\nenjoye yt’. Other entries direct that lawful authority must be obtained\r\nbefore printing, and in one case there is a specific reference to the\r\nroyal _Injunctions_.[542] Conditions of other kinds are also sometimes\r\nfound in entries; a book must be printed at a particular press, or the\r\nlicence is to be voided if it prove to be another man’s copy.[543] The\r\ncaution of the Stationers may have been motived by dissatisfaction\r\non the part of the government which finally took shape in the issue\r\nof the Star Chamber order of 23 June 1586. This was a result of the\r\nfirmer policy towards Puritan indiscipline initiated by Whitgift and\r\nthe new High Commission which he procured on his succession to the\r\nprimacy in 1583.[544] It had two main objects. One, with which we are\r\nnot immediately concerned, was to limit the number of printers and\r\ntheir presses; the other, to concentrate the censorship of all ordinary\r\nbooks, including plays, in the hands of the archbishop and the bishop.\r\nIt is not clear whether the prelates were to act in their ordinary\r\ncapacity or as High Commissioners; anyhow they had the authority of\r\nthe High Commission, itself backed by the Privy Council, behind them.\r\nThe effect of the order is shown in a bustle amongst the publishers\r\nto get on to the register a number of ballads and other trifles which\r\nthey had hitherto neglected to enter, and in a considerable increase\r\nin the submissions of books for approval, either to the prelates\r\nthemselves, or to persons who are now clearly acting as ecclesiastical\r\ndeputies.[545] On 30 June 1588 an official list of deputies was issued\r\nby the archbishop, and amongst these were several who had already\r\nauthorized books before and after 1586. These deputies, and other\r\ncorrectors whose names appear in the register at later dates, are as a\r\nrule traceable as episcopal chaplains, prebendaries of St. Paul’s, or\r\nholders of London benefices.[546] Some of them were themselves members\r\nof the High Commission. Occasionally laymen were appointed.[547] The\r\nmain work of correction now fell to these officials, but books were\r\nstill sometimes allowed by the archbishop or bishop in person, or by\r\nthe Privy Council or some member of that body.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the changes of 1586–88 upon the entries in the register\r\nis on the whole one of degree rather than of kind. Occasionally the\r\nwording suggests a differentiation between the functions of the wardens\r\nand those of the ecclesiastical licensers, but more often the clerk\r\ncontents himself with a mere record of what ‘hands’ each book was\r\nunder.[548] Some shifting of the point of view is doubtless involved in\r\nthe fact that ‘Entered vnto him for his copie’ and ‘Allowed vnto him\r\nfor his copie’ now become the normal formulas, and by 1590–1 ‘Licenced\r\nvnto him’ has disappeared altogether.[549] But a great number of books,\r\nincluding most ballads and pamphlets and some plays, are still entered\r\nwithout note of any authority other than that of the wardens, and about\r\n1593 the proportion of cases submitted to the ecclesiastical deputies\r\nsensibly begins to slacken, although the continuance of conditional\r\nentries shows that some caution was exercised. An intervention of the\r\nprelates in 1599 reversed the tendency again.[550] As regards plays\r\nin particular, the wardens received a sharp reminder, ‘that noe\r\nplayes be printed except they be allowed by suche as haue authority’;\r\nand although they do not seem to have interpreted this as requiring\r\nreference to a corrector in every case, conditional entries of plays\r\nbecome for a time numerous.[551] They stop altogether in 1607, when the\r\nresponsibility for play correction appears to have been taken over,\r\npresumably under an arrangement with the prelates, by the Master of\r\nthe Revels.[552] Henceforward and to the end of Buck’s mastership,\r\nnearly all play entries are under the hands not only of the wardens,\r\nbut of the Master or of a deputy acting on his behalf. Meanwhile, for\r\nbooks other than plays, the ecclesiastical authority succeeded more\r\nand more in establishing itself, although even up to the time of the\r\nCommonwealth the wardens never altogether ceased to enter ballads and\r\nsuch small deer on their own responsibility.\r\n\r\nA little more may be gleaned from the ‘Fynes for breakinge of good\r\norders’, which like the book entries were recorded by the wardens in\r\ntheir annual accounts up to 1571 and by the clerk in his register\r\nfrom 1576 to 1605.[553] But many of these were for irregularities in\r\napprenticeship and the like, and where a particular book was concerned,\r\nthe book is more often named than the precise offence committed in\r\nrelation to it. The fine is for printing ‘contrary to the orders of\r\nthis howse’, ‘contrary to our ordenaunces’, or merely ‘disorderly’.\r\nTrade defects, such as ‘stechyng’ of books, are sometimes in question,\r\nand sometimes the infringement of other men’s copies.[554] But the\r\ncharacter of the books concerned suggests that some at least of the\r\nfines for printing ‘without lycense’, ‘without aucthoritie’, ‘without\r\nalowance’, ‘without entrance’, ‘before the wardyns handes were to yt’\r\nwere due to breaches of the regulations for censorship, and in a few\r\ninstances the information is specific.[555] The book is a ‘lewde’ book,\r\nor ‘not tolerable’, or has already been condemned to be burnt, or the\r\nprinting is contrary to ‘her maiesties prohibicon’ or ‘the decrees\r\nof the star chamber’.[556] More rarely a fine was accompanied by the\r\nsequestration of the offending books, or the breaking up of a press,\r\nor even imprisonment. In these cases the company may have been acting\r\nunder stimulus from higher powers; in dealing with a culprit in 1579,\r\nthey direct that ‘for his offence, so farre as it toucheth ye same\r\nhouse only, he shall paye a fine’.[557]\r\n\r\nPutting together the entries and the fines, we can arrive at an\r\napproximate notion of the position occupied by the Stationers’ Company\r\nas an intermediary between the individual stationers and the higher\r\npowers in Church and State. That it is only approximate and that many\r\npoints of detail remain obscure is largely due to the methods of\r\nthe clerk. Richard Collins did not realize the importance, at least\r\nto the future historian, of set diplomatic formulas, and it is by\r\nno means clear to what extent the variations in the phrasing of his\r\nrecord correspond to variations in the facts recorded. But it is my\r\nimpression that he was in substance a careful registrar, especially as\r\nregards the authority under which his entries were made, and that if\r\nhe did not note the presence in any case of a corrector’s ‘hand’ to\r\na book, it is fair evidence that such a hand was not before him. On\r\nthis assumption the register confirms the inference to be drawn from\r\nthe statements of Lambe and Kingston in 1636, that before 1586 the\r\nprovision of the _Injunctions_ for licensing by the High Commission for\r\nLondon was not ordinarily operative, and that as a rule the only actual\r\nlicences issued were those of the Stationers’ Company, who used their\r\nown discretion in submitting books about which they felt doubtful to\r\nthe bishop or the archbishop or to an authorized corrector.[558] That\r\nbooks licensed by the Company without such reference were regarded as\r\nhaving been technically licensed under the _Injunctions_, one would\r\nhesitate to say. Licence is a fairly general term, and as used in the\r\nStationers’ Register it does not necessarily cover anything more than\r\na permit required by the internal ordinances of the Company itself.\r\nCertainly its officials claimed to issue licences to its members for\r\nother purposes than printing.[559] What Lambe and Kingston do not\r\ntell us, and perhaps ought to have told us, is that, when the master\r\nand wardens did call in the assistance of expert referees, it was not\r\nto ‘ministers’ merely chosen by themselves that they applied, but\r\nto official correctors nominated by the High Commission, or by the\r\narchbishop or bishop on its behalf. Nor must it be supposed that no\r\nsupervision of the proceedings of the company was exercised by the High\r\nCommission itself. We find that body writing to the Company to uphold\r\na patent in 1560.[560] It was upon its motion in 1566 that the Privy\r\nCouncil made a Star Chamber order calling attention to irregularities\r\nwhich had taken place, and directing the master and wardens to search\r\nfor the offenders.[561] And its authority, concurrent with that of the\r\nPrivy Council itself, to license books, is confirmed by a letter of\r\nthe Council to the company in 1570.[562] So much for the period before\r\n1586. Another thing which Lambe and Kingston do not tell us, and which\r\nthe register, if it can be trusted, does, is that the effective change\r\nintroduced by the Star Chamber of that year was only one of degree and\r\nnot of kind. It is true that an increasing number of books came, after\r\none set-back, to be submitted to correctors; that the clerk begins to\r\nlay emphasis in his wording upon entrance rather than upon licence;\r\nthat there are some hints that the direct responsibility of the wardens\r\nwas for a kind of ‘allowance’ distinct from and supplementary to that\r\nof censorship. But it does not appear to be true that, then or at any\r\nlater time, they wholly refused to enter any book except after taking\r\ncognizance of an authority beyond their own.\r\n\r\nIn fact the register, from the very beginning, was not purely, or\r\nperhaps even primarily, one of allowances. It had two other functions,\r\neven more important from the point of view of the internal economy\r\nof the Company. It was a fee-book, subsidiary to the annual accounts\r\nof the wardens, and showing the details of sums which they had to\r\nreturn in those accounts.[563] And it was a register of copyrights.\r\nA stationer brought his copy to the wardens and paid his fee, in\r\norder that he might be protected by an official acknowledgement of his\r\ninterest in the book against any infringement by a trade competitor. No\r\ndoubt the wardens would not, and under the ordinances of the company\r\nmight not, give this acknowledgement, unless they were satisfied that\r\nthe book was one which might lawfully be printed. But copyright was\r\nwhat the stationer wanted, for after all most books were not dangerous\r\nin the eyes even of an Elizabethan censorship, whereas there would be\r\nlittle profit in publishing, if any rival were at liberty to cut in\r\nand reprint for himself the result of a successful speculation. It is\r\na clear proof of this that the entrances include, not only new books,\r\nbut also those in which rights had been transferred from one stationer\r\nto another.[564] Obviously no new allowance by a corrector would be\r\nrequired in such cases. And as regards copyright and licence alike,\r\nthe entry in the register, although convenient to all concerned, was\r\nin itself no more than registration, the formal putting upon record\r\nof action already taken upon responsible authority. This authority\r\ndid not rest with the clerk. In a few cases, indeed, he does seem to\r\nhave entered an unimportant book at his own discretion.[565] But his\r\nfunctions were really subordinate to those of the wardens, as is shown\r\nby his practice from about 1580, of regularly citing the ‘hands’ or\r\nsigned directions of those officers, as well as of the correctors, upon\r\nwhich he was acting. These ‘hands’ are not in the register, and there\r\nis sufficient evidence that they were ordinarily endorsed upon the\r\nmanuscript or a printed copy of the book itself.[566] Exceptionally\r\nthere might be an oral direction, or a separate letter or warrant of\r\napproval, which was probably preserved in a cupboard at the company’s\r\nhall.[567] Here too were kept copies of prints, although not, I\r\nthink, the endorsed copies, which seem to have remained with the\r\nstationers.[568] I take it that the procedure was somewhat as follows.\r\nThe stationer would bring his book to a warden together with the fee or\r\nsome plausible excuse for deferring payment to a later date. The warden\r\nhad to consider the questions both of property and of licence. Possibly\r\nthe title of each book was published in the hall, in order that any\r\nother stationer who thought that he had an interest in it might make\r\nhis claim.[569] Cases of disputed interest would go for determination\r\nto the Court of Assistants, who with the master and wardens for the\r\nyear formed the ultimate governing body of the company, and had\r\npower in the last resort to revoke an authority to print already\r\ngranted.[570] But if no difficulty as to ownership arose, and if the\r\nbook was already endorsed as allowable by a corrector, the warden would\r\nadd his own endorsement, and it was then open to the stationer to take\r\nthe book to the clerk, show the ‘hands’, pay the fee if it was still\r\noutstanding, and get the formalities completed by registration.[571]\r\nIf, however, the warden found no endorsement by a corrector on the\r\ncopy, then there were three courses open to him. He might take the\r\nrisk of passing an obviously harmless book on his own responsibility.\r\nHe might refuse his ‘hand’ until the stationer had got that of the\r\ncorrector. Or he might make a qualified endorsement, which the clerk\r\nwould note in the register, sanctioning publication so far as copyright\r\nwas concerned, but only upon condition that proper authority should\r\nfirst be obtained. The dates on the title-pages of plays, when compared\r\nwith those of the entries, suggest that, as would indeed be natural,\r\nthe procedure was completed before publication; not necessarily before\r\nprinting, as the endorsements were sometimes on printed copies.[572]\r\nSeveral cases of re-entry after a considerable interval may indicate\r\nthat copyright lapsed unless it was exercised within a reasonable time.\r\nAs a rule, a play appeared within a year or so after it was entered,\r\nand was either printed or published by the stationer who had entered\r\nit, or by some other to whom he is known, or may plausibly be supposed,\r\nto have transferred his interest. Where a considerable interval exists\r\nbetween the date of an entry and that of the first known print, it is\r\nsometimes possible that an earlier print has been lost.[573]\r\n\r\nI do not think that it can be assumed that the absence of an entry in\r\nthe register is evidence that the book was not duly licensed, so far\r\nas the ecclesiastical authorities were concerned. If its status was\r\nsubsequently questioned, the signed copy could itself be produced.\r\nCertainly, when a conditional entry had been made, requiring better\r\nauthority to be obtained, the fulfilment of the condition was by\r\nno means always, although it was sometimes, recorded. Possibly the\r\n‘better authority’ was shown to the warden rather than the clerk.\r\nOn the other hand, it is certain that, under the ordinances of the\r\nCompany, publication without entrance exposed the stationer to a\r\nfine, and it is therefore probable that entrance was also necessary\r\nto secure copyright.[574] Sometimes the omission was repaired on the\r\noccasion of a subsequent transfer of interest. So far as plays are\r\nconcerned, there seems to have been greater laxity in this respect\r\nas time went on. Before 1586, or at any rate before 1584, there are\r\nhardly any unentered plays, if we make the reasonable assumption\r\nthat certain prints of 1573 and 1575 appeared in the missing lists\r\nfor 1571–5.[575] Between 1584 and 1615 the number is considerable,\r\nbeing over fifty, or nearly a quarter of the total number of plays\r\nprinted during that period. An examination of individual cases does\r\nnot disclose any obvious reason why some plays should be entered and\r\nothers not. The unentered plays are spread over the whole period\r\nconcerned. They come from the repertories of nearly all the theatres.\r\nThey include ‘surreptitious’ plays, which may be supposed to have been\r\nprinted without the consent of the authors or owners, but they also\r\ninclude plays to which prefaces by authors or owners are prefixed. They\r\nwere issued by publishers of good standing as well as by others less\r\nreputable; and as a rule their publishers appear to have been entering\r\nor not entering, quite indifferently, at about the same date. To this\r\ngeneralization I find an exception, in Thomas Archer, who printed\r\nsix plays without entry between 1607 and 1613 and entered none.[576]\r\nThe large number of unentered plays is rather a puzzle, and I do not\r\nknow the solution. In some cases, as we shall see, the publishers\r\nmay have preferred not to court publicity for their enterprises by\r\nbringing them before the wardens. In others they may merely have been\r\nunbusinesslike, or may have thought that the chances of profit hardly\r\njustified the expenditure of sixpence on acquiring copyright. Yet many\r\nof the unentered plays went through more than one edition, including\r\n_Mucedorus_, a book of enduring popularity, and they do not appear to\r\nhave been particularly subject to invasion by rival publishers. I will\r\nleave it to Mr. Pollard.\r\n\r\nThese being the conditions, let us consider what number and what kinds\r\nof plays got into print. It will be convenient to deal separately\r\nwith the two periods 1557–85 and 1586–1616. The operations of the\r\nCompany under their charter had hardly begun before Mary died. The\r\nElizabethan printing of plays opens in 1559 and for the first five\r\nyears is of a retrospective character. Half a dozen publishers, led\r\nby John King, who died about 1561, and Thomas Colwell, who started\r\nbusiness in the same year, issued or entered seventeen plays. Of these\r\none is not extant. One is a ‘May-game’, perhaps contemporary. Five are\r\ntranslations; four are Marian farces of the school of Udall, one a\r\n_débat_ by John Heywood, and five Protestant interludes of the reigns\r\nof Henry and Edward, roughly edited in some cases so as to adapt them\r\nto performance under the new queen.[577] One more example of earlier\r\nTudor drama, _Ralph Roister Doister_, in addition to mere reprints,\r\nappeared after 1565.[578] And with that year, after a short lull of\r\nactivity, begins the genuine Elizabethan harvest, which by 1585 had\r\nyielded forty-two plays, of which thirty-nine are extant, although\r\ntwo only in the form of fragments. On analysis, the greater number\r\nof these, seventeen in all, fall into a group of moral interludes,\r\noften controversial in tone, and in some cases approximating, through\r\nthe intermingling of concrete with abstract personages, on the one\r\nhand to classical comedy, on the other to the mediaeval miracle-play.\r\nThere are also twelve translations or adaptations, including two from\r\nItalian comedy. There is one neo-classical tragedy. And there are\r\nnine plays which can best be classified as histories, of which seven\r\nhave a classical and two a romantic colouring.[579] It is of interest\r\nto compare this output of the printing-press with the chronicle of\r\nCourt performances over the same years which is recorded in the Revels\r\nAccounts.[580] Here we get, so far of course as can be judged from\r\na bare enumeration of titles, fourteen morals, twenty-one classical\r\nhistories, mainly shown by boys, twenty-two romantic histories, mainly\r\nshown by men, and perhaps three farces, two plays of contemporary\r\nrealism, with one ‘antick’ play and two groups of short dramatic\r\nepisodes. It is clear that the main types are the same in both lists.\r\nBut only one of the printed plays, _Orestes_, actually appears in the\r\nCourt records, although _Damon and Pythias_, _Gorboduc_, _Sapho and\r\nPhao_, _Campaspe_, and _The Arraignment of Paris_ were also given at\r\nCourt, and the Revels Accounts after all only cover comparatively few\r\nyears out of the whole period.[581] And there is a great discrepancy in\r\nthe proportions in which the various types are represented. The morals,\r\nwhich were obsolescent at Court, are far more numerous in print than\r\nthe classical and romantic histories, which were already in enjoyment\r\nof their full vogue upon the boards. My definite impression is that\r\nthese early printed morals, unlike the prints of later date, were in\r\nthe main not drawn from the actual repertories of companies, but were\r\nliterary products, written with a didactic purpose, and printed in the\r\nhope that they would be bought both by readers and by schoolmasters in\r\nsearch of suitable pieces for performance by their pupils. They belong,\r\nlike some similar interludes, both original and translated, of earlier\r\ndate, rather to the tradition of the humanist academic drama, than to\r\nthat of the professional, or even quasi-professional, stage. There are\r\nmany things about the prints which, although not individually decisive,\r\ntend when taken in bulk to confirm this theory. They are ‘compiled’,\r\naccording to their title-pages; sometimes the author is declared a\r\n‘minister’ or a ‘learned clerke’.[582] Nothing is, as a rule, said\r\nto indicate that they have been acted.[583] They are advertised, not\r\nonly as ‘new’, ‘merry’, ‘pretty’, ‘pleasant’, ‘delectable’, ‘witty’,\r\n‘full of mirth and pastime’, but also as ‘excellent’, ‘worthy’,\r\n‘godly’, ‘pithy’, ‘moral’, ‘pityfull’, ‘learned’, and ‘fruitfull’,\r\nand occasionally the precise didactic intention is more elaborately\r\nexpounded either on the title-page or in a prologue.[584] They are\r\nfurnished with analyses showing the number of actors necessary to take\r\nall the parts, and in one case there is a significant note that the\r\narrangement is ‘most convenient for such as be disposed, either to\r\nshew this comedie in priuate houses, or otherwise’.[585] They often\r\nconclude with a generalized prayer for the Queen and the estates of\r\nthe realm, which omits any special petition for the individual lord\r\nsuch as we have reason to believe the protected players used.[586]\r\nThe texts are much better than the later texts based upon acting\r\ncopies. The stage-directions read like the work of authors rather\r\nthan of book-keepers, notably in the use of ‘out’ rather than of ‘in’\r\nto indicate exits, and in the occasional insertion both of hints for\r\n‘business’ and of explanatory comments aimed at a reader rather than\r\nan actor.[587] It should be added that this type of play begins to\r\ndisappear at the point when the growing Calvinist spirit led to a sharp\r\nbreach between the ministry and the stage, and discredited even moral\r\nplay-writing amongst divines. The latest morals, of which there are\r\nsome even during the second period of play-publication, have much more\r\nthe look of rather antiquated survivals from working repertories.[588]\r\nThe ‘May-game’ of _Robin Hood_ seems to me to be of a literary origin\r\nsimilar to that of the contemporary ‘morals’.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the period a new element is introduced with Lyly and\r\nPeele, who, like Edwardes before them, were not divines but secular\r\nscholars, and presumably desired a permanent life for their literary\r\nachievements. The publication of Lyly’s plays for Paul’s carries us\r\non into the period 1586–1616, and the vaunting of their performance\r\nbefore the Queen is soon followed by that of other plays, beginning\r\nwith _The Troublesome Reign of John_, as publicly acted in the City\r\nof London. During 1586–1616 two hundred and thirty-seven plays in\r\nall were published or at least entered on the Stationers’ Register,\r\nin addition to thirteen printed elsewhere than in London. Of many of\r\nthese, and of some of those earlier published, there were one or more\r\nreprints. It is not until the last year of the period that the first\r\nexample of a collective edition of the plays of any author makes its\r\nappearance. This is _The Workes of Benjamin Jonson_, which is moreover\r\nin folio, whereas the prints of individual plays were almost invariably\r\nin quarto.[589] A second volume of Jonson’s _Works_ was begun in 1631\r\nand completed in 1640. Shakespeare’s plays had to wait until 1623\r\nfor collective treatment, Lyly’s until 1632, Marston’s until 1633,\r\nand Beaumont and Fletcher’s until 1647 and 1679, although a partial\r\ncollection of Shakespearian plays in quarto has been shown to have\r\nbeen contemplated and abandoned in 1619.[590] Of the two hundred and\r\nthirty-seven plays proposed for publication two hundred and fourteen\r\nare extant. Twenty-three are only known by entries in the Stationers’\r\nRegister, and as plays were not always entered, it is conceivable that\r\none or two may have been published, and have passed into oblivion. Of\r\nthe two hundred and fourteen extant plays, six are translations from\r\nthe Latin, Italian, or French, and seven may reasonably be suspected of\r\nbeing merely closet plays, intended for the eye of the reader alone.\r\nThe other two hundred and one may be taken to have undergone the\r\ntest of actual performance. Six were given by amateurs, at Court or\r\nelsewhere, and eleven, of which three are Latin and eight English, are\r\nUniversity plays. So far as the professional companies are concerned,\r\nthe repertories which have probably been best preserved, owing to\r\nthe fact that the poets were in a position to influence publication,\r\nare those of the boys. We have thirty-one plays which, certainly or\r\nprobably, came to the press from the Chapel and Queen’s Revels boys,\r\ntwenty-five from the Paul’s boys, and eight from the King’s Revels\r\nboys. To the Queen’s men we may assign eleven plays, to Sussex’s three,\r\nto Pembroke’s five, to Derby’s four, to Oxford’s one, to Strange’s or\r\nthe Admiral’s and Henry’s thirty-two, to the Chamberlain’s and King’s\r\nthirty-four, to Worcester’s and Anne’s sixteen, to Charles’s one.\r\nSome of these had at earlier dates been played by other companies.\r\nFifteen plays remain, not a very large proportion, which cannot be\r\nsafely assigned.[591] There are twenty-seven manuscript English plays\r\nor fragments of plays or plots of plays, and twenty-one Latin ones,\r\nmostly of a university type, which also belong to the period 1586–1616.\r\nThere are fifty-one plays which were certainly or probably produced\r\nbefore 1616, but were not printed until later, many of them in the\r\nShakespeare and Beaumont and Fletcher folios. And there are some\r\ntwenty-two others, which exist in late prints, but may be wholly, or\r\nmore often partially, of early workmanship. The resultant total of\r\nthree hundred and seven is considerable, but there is reason to suppose\r\nthat it only represents a comparatively small fraction of the complete\r\ncrop of these thirty pullulating dramatic years. Of over two hundred\r\nand eighty plays recorded by Henslowe as produced or commissioned by\r\nthe companies for whom he acted as banker between 1592 and 1603, we\r\nhave only some forty and perhaps revised versions of a few others.[592]\r\nThomas Heywood claimed in 1633 to have had ‘an entire hand, or at least\r\na maine finger’, in not less than two hundred and twenty plays, and\r\nof these we can only identify or even guess at about two score, of\r\nwhich several are certainly lost. That any substantial number of plays\r\ngot printed, but have failed to reach us, is improbable. From time\r\nto time an unknown print, generally of early date, turns up in some\r\nbibliographical backwater, but of the seventy-five titles which I have\r\nbrought together under the head of ‘Lost Plays’ some probably rest\r\nupon misunderstandings and others represent works which were not plays\r\nat all, while a large proportion are derived from late entries in the\r\nStationers’ Register by Humphrey Moseley of plays which he may have\r\npossessed in manuscript but never actually proceeded to publish.[593]\r\nSome of the earlier unfulfilled entries may be of similar type. An\r\ninteresting piece of evidence pointing to the practically complete\r\nsurvival at any rate of seventeenth-century prints is afforded in a\r\ncatalogue of his library of plays made by Sir John Harington in or\r\nabout 1610.[594] Harington possessed 129 distinct plays, as well as\r\na number of duplicates. Only 9 of these were printed before 1586. He\r\nhad 14 out of 38 printed during 1588–94, and 15 out of 25 printed\r\nduring 1595–99. His absence in Ireland during 1599 probably led him\r\nto miss several belonging to that year, and his most vigorous period\r\nas a collector began with 1600. During 1600–10 he secured 90 out of\r\n105; that is to say exactly six-sevenths of the complete output of\r\nthe London press. I neglect plays printed outside London in these\r\nfigures. There is only one play among the 129 which is not known to us.\r\nApparently it bore the title _Belinus and Brennus_.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed, and I think with justice, that the acting\r\ncompanies did not find it altogether to their advantage to have\r\ntheir plays printed. Heywood, indeed, in the epistle to his _English\r\nTraveller_ (1633) tells us that this was sometimes the case.[595]\r\nPresumably the danger was not so much that readers would not become\r\nspectators, as that other companies might buy the plays and act them;\r\nand of this practice there are some dubious instances, although at any\r\nrate by Caroline times it had been brought under control by the Lord\r\nChamberlain.[596] At any rate, we find the Admiral’s in 1600 borrowing\r\n40_s._ ‘to geue vnto the printer, to staye the printing of Patient\r\nGresell’.[597] We find the King’s Revels syndicate in 1608 entering\r\ninto a formal agreement debarring its members from putting any of the\r\nplay-books jointly owned by them into print. And we find the editor\r\nand publisher of _Troilus and Cressida_, although that had in fact\r\nnever been played, bidding his readers in 1609 ‘thanke fortune for the\r\nscape it hath made amongst you; since by the grand possessors wills I\r\nbeleeue you should have prayd for them rather than beene prayd’. The\r\nmarked fluctuation in the output of plays in different years is capable\r\nof explanation on the theory that, so long as the companies were\r\nprosperous, they kept a tight hold on their ‘books’, and only let them\r\npass into the hands of the publishers when adversity broke them up, or\r\nwhen they had some special need to raise funds. The periods of maximum\r\noutput are 1594, 1600, and 1607. In 1594 the companies were reforming\r\nthemselves after a long and disastrous spell of plague; and in\r\nparticular the Queen’s, Pembroke’s, and Sussex’s men were all ruined,\r\nand their books were thrown in bulk upon the market.[598] It has been\r\nsuggested that the sales of 1600 may have been due to Privy Council\r\nrestrictions of that year, which limited the number of companies, and\r\nforbade them to play for more than two days in the week.[599] But it is\r\nvery doubtful whether the limitation of days really became operative,\r\nand many of the plays published belonged to the two companies, the\r\nChamberlain’s and the Admiral’s, who stood to gain by the elimination\r\nof competitors. An alternative reason might be found in the call for\r\nready money involved by the building of the Globe in 1599 and the\r\nFortune in 1600. The main factor in 1607 was the closing of Paul’s and\r\nthe sale of the plays acted there.\r\n\r\nSometimes the companies were outwitted. Needy and unscrupulous\r\nstationers might use illegitimate means to acquire texts for which\r\nthey had not paid as a basis for ‘surreptitious’ or ‘piratical’\r\nprints.[600] A hired actor might be bribed to disclose his ‘part’ and\r\nso much as he could remember of the ‘parts’ of others. Dr. Greg has\r\nmade it seem probable that the player of the Host was an agent in\r\nfurnishing the text of the _Merry Wives_.[601] A player of Voltimand\r\nand other minor parts may have been similarly guilty as regards\r\n_Hamlet_.[602] Long before, the printer of _Gorboduc_ had succeeded in\r\n‘getting a copie thereof at some yongmans hand that lacked a little\r\nmoney and much discretion’. Or the poet himself might be to blame.\r\nThomas Heywood takes credit in the epistle to _The Rape of Lucrece_\r\nthat it had not been his custom ‘to commit my playes to the presse’,\r\nlike others who ‘have vsed a double sale of their labours, first to the\r\nstage, and after to the presse’. Yet this had not saved his plays from\r\npiracy, for some of them had been ‘copied only by the eare’ and issued\r\nin a corrupt and mangled form. A quarter of a century later, in writing\r\na prologue for a revival of his _If You Know not Me, You Know Nobody_,\r\nhe tells us that this was one of the corrupt issues, and adds that\r\n\r\n                  Some by Stenography drew\r\n    The plot: put it in print: (scarce one word trew).\r\n\r\nModern critics have sought in shorthand the source of other ‘bad’ and\r\nprobably surreptitious texts of plays, and one has gone so far as to\r\ntrace in them the peculiarities of a particular system expounded in\r\nthe _Characterie_ (1588) of Timothy Bright.[603] The whole question\r\nof surreptitious prints has naturally been explored most closely in\r\nconnexion with the textual criticism of Shakespeare, and the latest\r\ninvestigator, Mr. Pollard, has come to the conclusion that, in spite of\r\nthe general condemnation of the Folio editors, the only Shakespearian\r\nQuartos which can reasonably be labelled as surreptitious or as\r\ntextually ‘bad’ are the First Quartos of _Romeo and Juliet_, _Henry\r\nV_, _Merry Wives of Windsor_, _Hamlet_, and _Pericles_, although\r\nhe strongly suspects that there once existed a similar edition of\r\n_Love’s Labour’s Lost_.[604] I have no ground for dissenting from this\r\njudgement.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the actors, in protecting their property from the\r\npirates, could look for any assistance from the official controllers\r\nof the press is one of some difficulty. We may perhaps infer, with the\r\nhelp of the conditional entries of _The Blind Beggar of Alexandria_ and\r\n_The Spanish Tragedy_, and the special order made in the case of _Dr.\r\nFaustus_, that before assigning a ‘copy’ to one stationer the wardens\r\nof the Company took some steps to ascertain whether any other stationer\r\nlaid a claim to it. It does not follow that they also inquired whether\r\nthe applicant had come honestly or dishonestly by his manuscript.[605]\r\nMr. Pollard seems inclined to think that, although they were under no\r\nformal obligation to intervene, they would not be likely, as men of\r\ncommon sense, to encourage dishonesty.[606] If this argument stood\r\nalone, I should not have much confidence in it. There is a Publishers’\r\nAssociation to-day, doubtless composed of men of common sense, but it\r\nis not a body to which one would naturally commit interests which\r\nmight come into conflict with those of members of the trade. It would\r\nbe another matter, however, if the actors were in a position to bring\r\noutside interest to bear against the pirates, through the licensers, or\r\nthrough the Privy Council on whom ultimately the licensers depended.\r\nAnd this in fact seems to have been the way in which a solution of\r\nthe problem was gradually arrived at. Apart altogether from plays,\r\nthere are instances upon record in which individuals, who were in a\r\nposition to command influence, successfully adopted a similar method.\r\nWe find Fulke Greville in 1586 writing to Sir Francis Walsingham,\r\non the information of the stationer Ponsonby, to warn him that the\r\npublication of the _Arcadia_ was being planned, and to advise him to\r\nget ‘made stay of that mercenary book’ by means of an application to\r\nthe Archbishop or to Dr. Cosin, ‘who have, as he says, a copy to peruse\r\nto that end’.[607] Similarly we find Francis Bacon, in the preface to\r\nhis _Essayes_ of 1597, excusing himself for the publication on the\r\nground that surreptitious adventurers were at work, and ‘to labour\r\nthe staie of them had bin troublesome and subiect to interpretation’.\r\nEvidently he had come to a compromise, of which the Stationers’\r\nRegister retains traces in the cancellation by a court of an entry\r\nof the _Essayes_ to Richard Serger, and a re-entry to H. Hooper, the\r\nactual publisher, ‘under the handes of Master Francis Bacon, Master\r\nDoctor Stanhope, Master Barlowe, and Master Warden Lawson’.[608] The\r\nactors, too, were not wholly without influence. They had their patrons\r\nand protectors, the Lord Chamberlain and the Lord Admiral, in the Privy\r\nCouncil, and although, as Mr. Pollard points out, it certainly would\r\nnot have been good business to worry an important minister about every\r\nsingle forty-shilling piracy, it may have been worth while to seek\r\na standing protection, analogous to the old-fashioned ‘privilege’,\r\nagainst a series of such annoyances. At any rate, this is what, while\r\nthe Admiral’s contented themselves with buying off the printer of\r\n_Patient Grissell_, the Chamberlain’s apparently attempted, although\r\nat first with indifferent success, to secure. In 1597 John Danter, a\r\nstationer of the worst reputation, had printed a surreptitious and\r\n‘bad’ edition of _Romeo and Juliet_, and possibly, if Mr. Pollard’s\r\nconjecture is right, another of _Love’s Labour’s Lost_. He had made no\r\nentry in the Register, and it was therefore open to another publisher,\r\nCuthbert Burby, to issue, without breach of copyright, ‘corrected’\r\neditions of the same plays.[609] This he did, with suitable trumpetings\r\nof the corrections on the title-pages, and presumably by arrangement\r\nwith the Chamberlain’s men. It was this affair which must, I think,\r\nhave led the company to apply for protection to their lord. On 22 July\r\n1598 an entry was made in the Stationers’ Register of _The Merchant\r\nof Venice_ for the printer James Roberts. This entry is conditional\r\nin form, but it differs from the normal conditional entries in that\r\nthe requirement specified is not an indefinite ‘aucthoritie’ but a\r\n‘lycence from the Right honorable the lord chamberlen’. Roberts also\r\nentered _Cloth Breeches and Velvet Hose_ on 27 May 1600, _A Larum\r\nfor London_ on 29 May 1600, and _Troilus and Cressida_ on 7 February\r\n1603. These also are all conditional entries but of a normal type. No\r\ncondition, however, is attached to his entry of _Hamlet_ on 26 July\r\n1602. Now comes a significant piece of evidence, which at least shows\r\nthat in 1600, as well as in 1598, the Stationers’ Company were paying\r\nparticular attention to entries of plays coming from the repertory\r\nof the Chamberlain’s men. The register contains, besides the formal\r\nentries, certain spare pages upon which the clerk was accustomed to\r\nmake occasional memoranda, and amongst these memoranda we find the\r\nfollowing:[610]\r\n\r\n    My lord chamberlens menns plaies Entred\r\n                     viz\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 27 May 1600 To Master Robertes]\r\n\r\n    A moral of ‘clothe breches and velvet hose’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 27 May To hym]\r\n\r\n    Allarum to London\r\n\r\n                  4 Augusti\r\n    As you like yt, a booke            }\r\n    Henry the ffift, a booke           }\r\n    Every man in his humour, a booke   } to be staied\r\n    The commedie of ‘muche A doo about }\r\n      nothing’, a booke                }\r\n\r\nThere are possibly two notes here, but we may reasonably date them both\r\nin 1600, as _Every Man In his Humour_ was entered to Cuthbert Burby and\r\nWalter Burre on 14 August 1600 and _Much Ado about Nothing_ to Andrew\r\nWise and William Aspley on 23 August 1600, and these plays appeared\r\nin 1601 and 1600 respectively. _Henry V_ was published, without entry\r\nand in a ‘bad’ text by Thomas Millington and John Busby, also in 1600,\r\nwhile _As You Like It_ remained unprinted until 1623. Many attempts\r\nhave been made to explain the story of 4 August. Mr. Fleay conjectured\r\nthat it was due to difficulties of censorship; Mr. Furness that it was\r\ndirected against James Roberts, whom he regarded on the strength of\r\nthe conditional entries as a man of ‘shifty character’.[611] But there\r\nis no reason to read Roberts’s name into the August memorandum at all;\r\nand I agree with Mr. Pollard that the evidence of dishonesty against\r\nhim has been exaggerated, and that the privilege which he held for\r\nprinting all play-bills for actors makes it prima facie unlikely that\r\nhis relations with the companies would be irregular.[612] On the other\r\nhand, I hesitate to accept Mr. Pollard’s counter-theory that the four\r\nconditional Roberts entries were of the nature of a deliberate plan\r\n‘in the interest of the players in order to postpone their publication\r\ntill it could not injure the run of the play and to make the task of\r\nthe pirates more difficult’. One would of course suppose that any\r\nentry, conditional or not, might serve such a purpose, if the entering\r\nstationer was in league with the actors and deliberately reserved\r\npublication. This is presumably what the Admiral’s men paid Cuthbert\r\nBurby to do for _Patient Grissell_. Mr. Pollard applies the same theory\r\nto Edward Blount’s unconditional entries of _Pericles_ and _Antony and\r\nCleopatra_ in 1608, and it would certainly explain the delays in the\r\npublication of _Troilus and Cressida_ from 1603 to 1609 and of _Antony\r\nand Cleopatra_ from 1608 to 1623, and the absence of any edition of\r\n_Cloth Breeches and Velvet Hose_. But it does not explain why _Hamlet_,\r\nentered by Roberts in 1602, was issued by others in the ‘bad’ text of\r\n1603, or why _Pericles_ was issued by Henry Gosson in the ‘bad’ text\r\nof 1609.[613] Mr. Pollard’s interpretation of the facts appears to be\r\ninfluenced by the conditional character of four out of Roberts’s five\r\nentries during 1598–1603, and I understand him to believe that the\r\n‘further aucthoritie’ required for _Cloth Breeches and Velvet Hose_\r\nand _A Larum for London_ and the ‘sufficient aucthoritie’ required\r\nfor _Troilus and Cressida_ were of the same nature as the licence\r\nfrom the Lord Chamberlain specifically required for _The Merchant of\r\nVenice_.[614] It is not inconceivable that this may have been so, but\r\none is bound to take the Roberts conditional entries side by side with\r\nthe eight similar entries made between 1601 and 1606 for other men,\r\nand in three at least of these (_The Dutch Courtesan_, _Sir Giles\r\nGoosecap_, _The Fleir_) it is obvious that the authority demanded\r\nwas that of the official correctors. Of course, the correctors may\r\nthemselves have had a hint from the Lord Chamberlain to keep an eye\r\nupon the interests of his servants, but if the eleven conditionally\r\nentered plays of 1600–6 be looked at as a group, it will be seen that\r\nthey are all plays of either a political or a satirical character,\r\nwhich might well therefore call for particular attention from the\r\ncorrectors in the discharge of their ordinary functions. I have already\r\nsuggested that the normal conditional entries represent cases in which\r\nthe wardens of the Stationers’ Company, while not prepared to license\r\na book on their own responsibility, short-circuited as far as they\r\ncould the procedure entailed. Properly they ought to have seen the\r\ncorrector’s hand before adding their own endorsement. But if this was\r\nnot forthcoming, the applicant may have been allowed, in order to save\r\ntime, to have the purely trade formalities completed by a conditional\r\nentry, which would be a valid protection against a rival stationer,\r\nbut would not, until the corrector’s hand was obtained, be sufficient\r\nauthority for the actual printing. No doubt the clerk should have\r\nsubsequently endorsed the entry after seeing the corrector’s hand, but\r\nhe did not always do so, although in cases of transfer the transferee\r\nmight ask for a record to be made, and in any event the owner of the\r\ncopy had the book with the ‘hand’ to it. The Lord Chamberlain’s ‘stay’\r\nwas, I think, another matter. I suppose it to have been directed, not\r\nto the correctors, but to the wardens, and to have taken the form of\r\na request not to enter any play of the Chamberlain’s men, otherwise\r\nentitled to licence or not, without satisfying themselves that the\r\nactors were assenting parties to the transaction. Common sense would\r\ncertainly dictate compliance with such a request, coming from such a\r\nsource. The plan seems to have worked well enough so far as _As You\r\nLike It_, _Every Man In his Humour_, and _Much Ado about Nothing_\r\nwere concerned, for we have no reason to doubt that the subsequent\r\npublication of two of these plays had the assent of the Chamberlain’s\r\nmen, and the third was effectively suppressed. But somehow not only\r\n_Hamlet_ but also _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ slipped through in\r\n1602, and although the actors apparently came to some arrangement\r\nwith Roberts and furnished a revised text of _Hamlet_, the other play\r\nseems to have gone completely out of their control. Moreover, it was\r\nan obvious weakness of the method adopted, that it gave no security\r\nagainst a surreptitious printer who was in a position to dispense with\r\nan entry. Danter, after all, had published without entry in 1597. He\r\nhad had to go without copyright; but an even more audacious device was\r\nsuccessfully tried in 1600 with _Henry V_. This was one of the four\r\nplays so scrupulously ‘staied’ by the Stationers’ clerk on 4 August.\r\nNot merely, however, was the play printed in 1600 by Thomas Creede for\r\nThomas Millington and John Busby, but on 21 August it was entered on\r\nthe Register as transferred to Thomas Pavier amongst other ‘thinges\r\nformerlye printed and sett ouer to’ him. I think the explanation is\r\nthat the print of 1600 was treated as merely a reprint of the old play\r\nof _The Famous Victories of Henry V_, which was indeed to some extent\r\nShakespeare’s source, and of which Creede held the copyright.[615]\r\nSimilarly, it is conceivable that the same John Busby and Nathaniel\r\nButter forced the hands of the Chamberlain’s men into allowing the\r\npublication of _King Lear_ in 1608 by a threat to issue it as a reprint\r\nof _King Leir_.[616] Busby was also the enterer of _The Merry Wives_,\r\nand he and Butter, at whose hands it was that Heywood suffered, seem to\r\nhave been the chief of the surreptitious printers after Danter’s death.\r\n\r\nThe Chamberlain’s men would have been in a better position if their\r\nlord had brought his influence to bear, as Sidney’s friends had done,\r\nupon the correctors instead of the Stationers’ Company. Probably\r\nthe mistake was retrieved in 1607 when the ‘allowing’ of plays for\r\npublication passed to the Master of the Revels, and he may even\r\nhave extended his protection to the other companies which, like the\r\nChamberlain’s, had now passed under royal protection. I do not suggest\r\nthat the convenience of this arrangement was the sole motive for the\r\nchange; the episcopal correctors must have got into a good deal of\r\nhot water over the affair of _Eastward Ho!_[617] Even the Master of\r\nthe Revels did not prevent the surreptitious issue of _Pericles_ in\r\n1609. In Caroline times we find successive Lord Chamberlains, to whom\r\nthe Master of the Revels continued to be subordinate, directing the\r\nStationers’ Company not to allow the repertories of the King’s men or\r\nof Beeston’s boys to be printed, and it is implied that there were\r\nolder precedents for these protections.[618]\r\n\r\nA point might come at which it was really more to the advantage of the\r\nactors to have a play published than not. The prints were useful in\r\nthe preparation of acting versions, and they saved the book-keepers\r\nfrom the trouble of having to prepare manuscript copies at the demand\r\nof stage-struck amateurs.[619] The influence of the poets again was\r\non the side of publication, and it is perhaps due to the greater\r\nshare which they took in the management of the boys’ companies that\r\nso disproportionate a number of the plays preserved are of their\r\nacting. Heywood hints that thereby the poets sold their work twice. It\r\nis more charitable to assume that literary vanity was also a factor;\r\nand it is with playwrights of the more scholarly type, Ben Jonson\r\nand Marston, that a practice first emerges of printing plays at an\r\nearly date after publication, and in the full literary trappings of\r\ndedicatory epistles and commendatory verses. Actor-playwrights, such\r\nas Heywood himself and Dekker, followed suit; but not Shakespeare, who\r\nhad long ago dedicated his literary all to Southampton and penned no\r\nprefaces. The characteristic Elizabethan apologies, on such grounds as\r\nthe pushfulness of publishers or the eagerness of friends to see the\r\nimmortal work in type, need not be taken at their full face value.[620]\r\nOpportunity was afforded on publication to restore passages which had\r\nbeen ‘cut’ to meet the necessities of stage-presentation, and of this,\r\nin the Second Quarto of _Hamlet_, even Shakespeare may have availed\r\nhimself.[621]\r\n\r\nThe conditions of printing therefore furnish us with every variety\r\nof text, from the carefully revised and punctuated versions of\r\nBen Jonson’s _Works_ of 1616 to the scrappy notes, from memory or\r\nshorthand, of an incompetent reporter. The average text lies between\r\nthese extremes, and is probably derived from a play-house ‘book’ handed\r\nover by the actors to the printer. Mr. Pollard has dealt luminously\r\nwith the question of the nature of the ‘book’, and has disposed of the\r\nassumption that it was normally a copy made by a ‘play-house’ scrivener\r\nof the author’s manuscript.[622] For this assumption there is no\r\nevidence whatever. There is, indeed, little direct evidence, one way or\r\nother; but what there is points to the conclusion that the ‘original’\r\nor standard copy of a play kept in the play-house was the author’s\r\nautograph manuscript, endorsed with the licence of the Master of the\r\nRevels for performance, and marked by the book-keeper or for his use\r\nwith indications of cuts and the like, and with stage-directions for\r\nexits and entrances and the disposition of properties, supplementary\r\nto those which the author had furnished.[623] Most of the actual\r\nmanuscripts of this type which remain in existence are of Caroline,\r\nrather than Elizabethan or Jacobean, date.[624] But we have one of _The\r\nSecond Maid’s Tragedy_, bearing Buck’s licence of 1611, and one of _Sir\r\nThomas More_, belonging to the last decade of the sixteenth century,\r\nwhich has been submitted for licence without success, and is marked\r\nwith instructions by the Master for the excision or alteration of\r\nobnoxious passages. It is a curious document. The draft of the original\r\nauthor has been patched and interpolated with partial redrafts in a\r\nvariety of hands, amongst which, according to some palaeographers, is\r\nto be found that of Shakespeare. One wonders that any licenser should\r\nhave been complaisant enough to consider the play at all in such a\r\nform; and obviously the instance is a crucial one against the theory of\r\nscrivener’s copies.[625] It may also be argued on _a priori_ grounds\r\nthat such copies would be undesirable from the company’s point of view,\r\nboth as being costly and as tending to multiply the opportunities\r\nfor ‘surreptitious’ transmission to rivals or publishers. Naturally\r\nit was necessary to copy out individual parts for the actors, and\r\nAlleyn’s part in _Orlando Furioso_, with the ‘cues’, or tail ends of\r\nthe speeches preceding his own, can still be seen at Dulwich.[626] From\r\nthese ‘parts’ the ‘original’ could be reconstructed or ‘assembled’ in\r\nthe event of destruction or loss.[627] Apparently the book-keeper also\r\nmade a ‘plot’ or scenario of the action, and fixed it on a peg for\r\nhis own guidance and that of the property-man in securing the smooth\r\nprogress of the play.[628] Nor could the companies very well prevent\r\nthe poets from keeping transcripts or at any rate rough copies, when\r\nthey handed over their ‘papers’, complete or in instalments, as they\r\ndrew their ‘earnests’ or payments ‘in full’.[629] It does not follow\r\nthat they always did so. We know that Daborne made fair copies for\r\nHenslowe;[630] but the Folio editors tell us that what Shakespeare\r\nthought ‘he vttered with that easinesse, that we haue scarse receiued\r\nfrom him a blot in his papers’, and Mr. Pollard points out that there\r\nwould have been little meaning in this praise if what Shakespeare sent\r\nin had been anything but his first drafts.[631]\r\n\r\nThe character of the stage-directions in plays confirm the view that\r\nmany of them were printed from working play-house ‘originals’. They are\r\nprimarily directions for the stage itself; it is only incidentally that\r\nthey also serve to stimulate the reader’s imagination by indicating the\r\naction with which the lines before him would have been accompanied in\r\na representation.[632] Some of them are for the individual guidance of\r\nthe actors, marginal hints as to the ‘business’ which will give point\r\nto their speeches. These are not very numerous in play-house texts; the\r\n‘kneeling’ and ‘kisses her’ so frequent in modern editions are merely\r\nattempts of the editors to show how intelligently they have interpreted\r\nthe quite obvious implications of the dialogue. The more important\r\ndirections are addressed rather to the prompter and the tire-man; they\r\nprescribe the exits and the entrances, the ordering of a procession or\r\na dumb-show, the use of the curtains or other structural devices, the\r\nintroduction of properties, the precise moment for the striking up of\r\nmusic or sounds ‘within’. It is by no means always possible, except\r\nwhere a manuscript betrays differences of handwriting, to distinguish\r\nbetween what the author, often himself an actor familiar with the\r\npossibilities of the stage, may have originally written, and what\r\nthe book-keeper may have added. Either may well use the indicative\r\nor the imperative form, or merely an adverbial, participial, or\r\nsubstantival expression.[633] But it is natural to trace the hand of\r\nthe book-keeper where the direction reduces itself to the bare name of\r\na property noted in the margin; even more so when it is followed by\r\nsome such phrase as ‘ready’, ‘prepared’, or ‘set out’;[634] and still\r\nmore so when the note occurs at the point when the property has to\r\nbe brought from the tire-room, and some lines before it is actually\r\nrequired for use.[635] The book-keeper must be responsible, too, for\r\nthe directions into which, as not infrequently happens, the name of an\r\nactor has been inserted in place of that of the personage whom that\r\nactor represented.[636] On the other hand, we may perhaps safely assign\r\nto the author directions addressed to some one else in the second\r\nperson, those which leave something to be interpreted according to\r\ndiscretion, and those which contain any matter not really necessary\r\nfor stage guidance.[637] Such superfluous matter is only rarely found\r\nin texts of pure play-house origin, although even here an author\r\nmay occasionally insert a word or two of explanation or descriptive\r\ncolouring, possibly taken from the source upon which he has been\r\nworking.[638] In the main, however, descriptive stage-directions are\r\ncharacteristic of texts which, whether ultimately based upon play-house\r\ncopies or not, have undergone a process of editing by the author or\r\nhis representative, with an eye to the reader, before publication.\r\nSome literary rehandling of this sort is traceable, for example, in the\r\nFirst Folio of Shakespeare, although the hearts of the editors seem\r\nto have failed them before they had got very far with the task.[639]\r\nYet another type of descriptive stage-direction presents itself in\r\ncertain ‘surreptitious’ prints, where we find the reporter eking out\r\nhis inadequately recorded text by elaborate accounts of the details of\r\nthe business which he had seen enacted before him.[640] So too William\r\nPercy, apparently revising plays some of which had already been acted\r\nand which he hoped to see acted again, mingles his suggestions to a\r\nhypothetical manager with narratives in the past tense of how certain\r\nactors had carried out their parts.[641]\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that, because a play was printed from a stage\r\ncopy, the author had no chance of editing it. Probably the compositors\r\ntreated the manuscript put before them very freely, modifying, if they\r\ndid not obliterate, the individual notions of the author or scribe as\r\nto orthography and punctuation; and the master printer, or some press\r\ncorrector in his employment, went over and ‘improved’ their work,\r\nperhaps not always with much reference to the original ‘copy’.[642]\r\nThis process of correction continued during the printing off of the\r\nsuccessive sheets, with the result that different examples of the same\r\nimprint often show the same sheet in corrected and in uncorrected\r\nstates.[643] The trend of modern criticism is in the direction of\r\nregarding Shakespeare’s plays as printed, broadly speaking, without\r\nany editorial assistance from him; the early quartos from play-house\r\nmanuscripts, the later quartos from the earlier quartos, the folio\r\npartly from play-house manuscripts, partly from earlier quartos used in\r\nthe play-house instead of manuscripts, and bearing marks of adaptation\r\nto shifting stage requirements.[644] On this theory, the aberrations\r\nof the printing-house, even with the author’s original text before\r\nthem, have to account in the main for the unsatisfactory condition in\r\nwhich, in spite of such posthumous editing, not very extensive, as was\r\ndone for the folio, even the best texts of the plays have reached us.\r\nWhether it is sound or not--I think that it probably is--there were\r\nother playwrights who were far from adopting Shakespeare’s attitude of\r\ndetachment from the literary fate of his works. Jonson was a careful\r\neditor. Marston, Middleton, and Heywood all apologize for misprints in\r\nvarious plays, which they say were printed without their knowledge, or\r\nwhen they were urgently occupied elsewhere; and the inference must be\r\nthat in normal circumstances the responsibility would have rested with\r\nthem.[645] Marston, indeed, definitely says that he had ‘perused’ the\r\nsecond edition of _The Fawn_, in order ‘to make some satisfaction for\r\nthe first faulty impression’.[646]\r\n\r\nThe modern editions, with their uniform system of acts and scenes and\r\ntheir fanciful notes of locality--‘A room in the palace’, ‘Another\r\nroom in the palace’--are again misleading in their relation to the\r\nearly prints, especially those based upon the play-house. Notes of\r\nlocality are very rare. Occasionally a definite shift from one country\r\nor town to another is recorded;[647] and a few edited plays, such as\r\nBen Jonson’s, prefix, with a ‘dramatis personae’, a general indication\r\nof ‘The scene’.[648] For the rest, the reader is left to his own\r\ninferences, with such help as the dialogue and the presenters give him;\r\nand the modern editors, with a post-Restoration tradition of staging\r\nin their minds, have often inferred wrongly. Even the shoulder-notes\r\nappended to the accurate reprints of the Malone Society, although they\r\ndo not attempt localities, err by introducing too many new scenes.\r\nIn the early prints the beginnings of scenes are rarely marked, and\r\nthe beginnings of acts are left unmarked to an extent which is rather\r\nsurprising. The practice is by no means uniform, and it is possible\r\nto distinguish different tendencies in texts of different origin. The\r\nTudor interludes and the early Elizabethan plays of the more popular\r\ntype are wholly undivided, and there was probably no break in the\r\ncontinuity of the performances.[649] Acts and scenes, which are the\r\noutward form of a method of construction derived from the academic\r\nanalysis of Latin comedy and tragedy, make their appearance, with other\r\nnotes of neo-classic influence, in the farces of the school of Udall,\r\nin the Court tragedies, in translated plays, in Lyly’s comedies, and\r\nin a few others belonging to the same _milieu_ of scholarship.[650]\r\nBen Jonson and a few other later writers adopt them in printing plays\r\nof theatrical origin.[651] But the great majority of plays belonging\r\nto the public theatres continue to be printed without any divisions\r\nat all, while plays from the private houses are ordinarily divided\r\ninto acts, but not into scenes, although the beginning of each act has\r\nusually some such heading as ‘Actus Primus, Scena prima’.[652] This\r\ndistinction corresponds to the greater significance of the act-interval\r\nin the performance of the boy companies; but, as I have pointed out\r\nin an earlier chapter, it is difficult to suppose that the public\r\ntheatres paid no regard to act-intervals, and one cannot therefore\r\nquite understand why neither the poets nor the book-keepers were in the\r\nhabit of showing them in the play-house ‘originals’ of plays.[653]\r\nHad they been shown there, they would almost inevitably have got into\r\nthe prints. It is a peculiarity of the surreptitious First Quarto of\r\n_Romeo and Juliet_, that its later sheets, which differ typographically\r\nfrom the earlier ones, although they do not number either acts or\r\nscenes, insert lines of ornament at the points at which acts and\r\nscenes may be supposed to begin. It must be added that, so far as an\r\nElizabethan playwright looked upon his work as made up of scenes, his\r\nconception of a scene was not as a rule that familiar to us upon the\r\nmodern stage. The modern scene may be defined as a piece of action\r\ncontinuous in time and place between two falls of a drop-curtain. The\r\nElizabethans had no drop-curtain, and the drawing of an alcove curtain,\r\nat any rate while personages remain on the stage without, does not\r\nafford the same solution of continuity. The nearest analogy is perhaps\r\nin such a complete clearance of the stage, generally with a shift of\r\nlocality, as enables the imagination to assume a time interval. A few\r\ntexts, generally of the seventeenth century, are divided into scenes\r\non this principle of clearance; and it was adopted by the editors\r\nof the First Folio, when, in a half-hearted way, they attempted to\r\ndivide up the continuous texts of their manuscripts and quartos.[654]\r\nBut it was not the principle of the neo-classic dramatists, or of Ben\r\nJonson and his school. For them a scene was a section, not of action,\r\nbut of dialogue; and they started a new scene whenever a speaker, or\r\nat any rate a speaker of importance, entered or left the stage. This\r\nis the conception which is in the mind of Marston when he regrets,\r\nin the preface to _The Malcontent_, that ‘scenes, invented merely to\r\nbe spoken, should be enforcively published to be read’. It is also\r\nthe conception of the French classicist drama, although the English\r\nplaywrights do not follow the French rule of _liaison_, which requires\r\nat least one speaker from each scene to remain on into the next, and\r\nthus secures continuity throughout each act by making a complete\r\nclearance of the stage impossible.[655]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXIII\r\n\r\n                              PLAYWRIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\n   [_Bibliographical Note._--The abundant literature of the drama\r\n   is more satisfactorily treated in the appendices to F. E.\r\n   Schelling, _Elizabethan Drama_ (1908), and vols. v and vi (1910)\r\n   of the _Cambridge History of English Literature_, than in R. W.\r\n   Lowe, _Bibliographical Account of English Theatrical Literature_\r\n   (1888), K. L. Bates and L. B. Godfrey, _English Drama: a Working\r\n   Basis_ (1896), or W. D. Adams, _Dictionary of the Drama_ (1904).\r\n   There is an American pamphlet on _Materials for the Study of the\r\n   English Drama, excluding Shakespeare_ (1912, Newbery Library,\r\n   Chicago), which I have not seen. Periodical lists of new books\r\n   are published in the _Modern Language Review_, the _Beiblatt_\r\n   to _Anglia_, and the _Bulletin_ of the English Association,\r\n   and annual bibliographies by the _Modern Humanities Research\r\n   Association_ (from 1921) and in the Shakespeare _Jahrbuch_.\r\n   The bibliography by H. R. Tedder in the _Encyclopaedia\r\n   Britannica_ (11th ed.) s.v. Shakespeare, A. C. Shaw, _Index to\r\n   the Shakespeare Memorial Library_ (1900–3), and W. Jaggard,\r\n   _Shakespeare Bibliography_ (1911), on which, however, cf. C. S.\r\n   Northup in _J. G. P._ xi. 218, are also useful.\r\n\r\n   W. W. Greg, _Notes on Dramatic Bibliographers_ (1911, _M.\r\n   S. C._ i. 324), traces from the publishers’ advertisements\r\n   of the Restoration a _catena_ of play-lists in E. Phillips,\r\n   _Theatrum Poetarum_ (1675), W. Winstanley, _Lives of the Most\r\n   Famous English Poets_ (1687), G. Langbaine, _Momus Triumphans_\r\n   (1688) and _Account of the English Dramatick Poets_ (1691), C.\r\n   Gildon, _Lives and Characters of the English Dramatick Poets_\r\n   (1698), W. R. Chetwood, _The British Theatre_ (1750), E. Capell,\r\n   _Notitia Dramatica_ (1783), and the various editions of the\r\n   _Biographica Dramatica_ from 1764 to 1812. More recent are J. O.\r\n   Halliwell-Phillipps, _Dictionary of Old English Plays_ (1860),\r\n   and W. C. Hazlitt, _Manual of Old English Plays_ (1892); but\r\n   all are largely superseded by W. W. Greg, _A List of English\r\n   Plays_ (1900) and _A List of Masques, Pageants, &c._ (1902).\r\n   His account of Warburton’s collection in _The Bakings of Betsy_\r\n   (_Library_, 1911) serves as a supplement. A few plays discovered\r\n   later than 1900 appeared in an Irish sale of 1906 (cf.\r\n   _Jahrbuch_, xliii. 310) and in the Mostyn sale of 1919 (cf. t.p.\r\n   facsimiles in Sotheby’s sale catalogue). For the problems of the\r\n   early prints, the _Bibliographical Note_ to ch. xxii should be\r\n   consulted.\r\n\r\n   I ought to add that the notices of the early prints of plays\r\n   in this and the following chapter lay no claim to minute\r\n   bibliographical erudition, and that all deficiencies in this\r\n   respect are likely to be corrected when the full results of Dr.\r\n   Greg’s researches on the subject are published.\r\n\r\n   The fundamental works on the history of the drama are A. W.\r\n   Ward, _History of English Dramatic Literature_ (1875, 1899), F.\r\n   G. Fleay, _Biographical Chronicle of the English Drama_ (1891),\r\n   F. E. Schelling, _Elizabethan Drama_ (1908), the _Cambridge\r\n   History of English Literature_, vols. v and vi (1910), and W.\r\n   Creizenach, _Geschichte des neueren Dramas_, vols. iv, v (1909,\r\n   1916). These and others, with the relevant periodicals, are\r\n   set out in the _General Bibliographical Note_ (vol. i); and to\r\n   them may be added F. S. Boas, _Shakspere and his Predecessors_\r\n   (1896), B. Matthews, _The Development of the Drama_ (1904), F.\r\n   E. Schelling, _English Drama_ (1914), A. Wynne, _The Growth of\r\n   English Drama_ (1914). Less systematic collections of studies\r\n   are L. M. Griffiths, _Evenings with Shakespeare_ (1889), J. R.\r\n   Lowell, _Old English Dramatists_ (1892), A. H. Tolman, _The\r\n   Views about Hamlet_ (1904), C. Crawford, _Collectanea_ (1906–7),\r\n   A. C. Swinburne, _The Age of Shakespeare_ (1908). The older\r\n   critical work of Charles Lamb, William Hazlitt, and others\r\n   cannot be neglected, but need not be detailed here.\r\n\r\n   Special dissertations on individual plays and playwrights\r\n   are recorded in the body of this chapter. A few of wider\r\n   scope may be roughly classified; as dealing with dramatic\r\n   structure, H. Schwab, _Das Schauspiel im Schauspiel zur Zeit\r\n   Shakespeares_ (1896), F. A.

Sachs, _Die Shakespeare zugeschriebenen zweifelhaften\r\n   Stücke_ (1892, _Jahrbuch_, xxvii), and A. F. Hopkinson,\r\n   _Essays on Shakespeare’s Doubtful Plays_ (1900). The analogous\r\n   question of the possible non-Shakespearian authorship of plays\r\n   or parts of plays published as his is too closely interwoven\r\n   with specifically Shakespearian literature to be handled here;\r\n   J. M. Robertson, in _Did Shakespeare Write Titus Andronicus?_\r\n   (1905), _Shakespeare and Chapman_ (1917), _The Shakespeare\r\n   Canon_ (1922), is searching; other dissertations are cited\r\n   under the plays or playwrights concerned. The attempts to use\r\n   metrical or other ‘tests’ in the discrimination of authorship\r\n   or of the chronology of work have been predominantly applied to\r\n   Shakespeare, although Beaumont and Fletcher (_vide infra_) and\r\n   others have not been neglected. The broader discussions of E.\r\n   N. S. Thompson, _Elizabethan Dramatic Collaboration_ (1909, _E.\r\n   S._ xl. 30) and E. H. C. Oliphant, _Problems of Authorship in\r\n   Elizabethan Dramatic Literature_ (1911, _M.

Then I take each play, mask, &c., up\r\nto 1616 and give (_a_) the MSS. if any; (_b_) the essential parts of\r\nthe entry, if any, on the Stationers’ Register, including in brackets\r\nthe name of any licenser other than an official of the Company, and\r\noccasionally adding a note of any transfer of copyright which seems\r\nof exceptional interest; (_c_) the essential parts of the title-page\r\nof the first known print; (_d_) a note of its prologues, epilogues,\r\nepistles, and other introductory matter; (_e_) the dates and imprints\r\nof later prints before the end of the seventeenth century with any new\r\nmatter from their t.ps. bearing on stage history; (_f_) lists of all\r\nimportant 18th-20th century editions and dissertations, not of the\r\ncollective or general type already dealt with; (_g_) such notes as may\r\nseem desirable on authorship, date, stage history and the like.

Similarly, I have in some cases recorded, on the authority\r\nof others, editions and dissertations which I have not personally\r\nexamined. The section devoted to each playwright concludes with lists\r\nof work not extant and of work of which his authorship has, often\r\nfoolishly, been conjectured. I ought to make it clear that many of my\r\ntitle-pages are borrowed from Dr. Greg, and that, while I have tried to\r\ngive what is useful for the history of the stage, I have no competence\r\nin matters of minute bibliographical accuracy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM ALABASTER (1567–1640)\r\n\r\nAlabaster, or Alablaster, was born at Hadleigh, Suffolk, in 1567 and\r\nentered Trinity College, Cambridge, from Westminster in 1583. His Latin\r\npoem _Eliseis_ is mentioned by Spenser in _Colin Clout’s Come Home\r\nAgain_ (1591). He was incorporated M.A. of Oxford in 1592, and went as\r\nchaplain to Essex in the Cadiz expedition of 1596. On 22 Sept. 1597\r\nRichard Percival wrote to Sir Robert Cecil (_Hatfield MSS._ vii. 394),\r\n‘Alabaster has made a tragedy against the Church of England’. Perhaps\r\nthis is not to be taken literally, but only refers to his conversion\r\nto Catholicism. Chamberlain, 7, 64, records that he was ‘clapt up for\r\npoperie’, had escaped from the Clink by 4 May 1598, but was recaptured\r\nat Rochelle. This was about the beginning of Aug. 1599 (_Hatfield\r\nMSS._ ix. 282). Later he was reconverted and at his death in 1640 held\r\nthe living of Therfield, Herts. He wrote on mystical theology, and a\r\nmanuscript collection of 43 sonnets, mostly unprinted, is described by\r\nB. Dobell in _Athenaeum_ (1903), ii. 856.\r\n\r\n                           _Roxana. c. 1592_\r\n\r\n[_MSS._] _T. C. C. MS._ (‘Authore Domino Alabaster’); _Camb. Univ.

Farnabius; engraved title-page, with representation of a stage\r\n(cf. ch. xviii, _Bibl.

The play is a Latin version of Luigi\r\nGroto’s _La Dalida_ (1567).\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM ALEXANDER, EARL OF STIRLING (_c._ 1568–1640).\r\n\r\nWilliam Alexander of Menstrie, after an education at Glasgow and Leyden\r\nand travel in France, Spain, and Italy, was tutor to Prince Henry\r\nbefore the accession of James, and afterwards Gentleman extraordinary\r\nof the Privy Chamber both to Henry and to Charles. He was knighted\r\nabout 1609, appointed a Master of Requests in 1614 and Secretary for\r\nScotland in 1626. He was created Earl of Stirling in 1633. He formed\r\nliterary friendships with Michael Drayton and William Drummond of\r\nHawthornden, but Jonson complained (Laing, 11) that ‘Sir W. Alexander\r\nwas not half kinde unto him, and neglected him, because a friend to\r\nDrayton’. His four tragedies read like closet plays, and his only\r\nconnexion with the stage appears to be in some verses to Alleyn after\r\nthe foundation of Dulwich in 1619 (Collier, _Memoirs of Alleyn_, 178).\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n_S.

Furness, _Julius Caesar_ (1913, _New Variorum\r\nShakespeare_, xvii).\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM ALLEY (_c._ 1510–70).\r\n\r\nAlley’s Πτωχὸμυσεῖον. _The Poore Mans Librarie_ (1565) contains three\r\nand a half pages of dialogue between Larymos and Phronimos, described\r\nas from ‘a certaine interlude or plaie intituled _Aegio_. In the which\r\nplaye ij persons interlocutorie do dispute, the one alledging for the\r\ndefence of destenie and fatall necessitie, and the other confuting the\r\nsame’. P. Simpson (_9 N. Q._ iii. 205) suggests that Alley was probably\r\nhimself the author. The book consists of _praelectiones_ delivered in\r\n1561 at St. Paul’s, of which Alley had been a Prebendary. He became\r\nBishop of Exeter in 1560. On his attitude to the public stage, cf. App.\r\nC. No. viii. It is therefore odd to find the Lord Bishop’s players at\r\nBarnstaple and Plymouth in 1560–1 (Murray, ii. 78).\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT AMERIE (_c._ 1610).\r\n\r\nThe deviser of the show of _Chester’s Triumph_ (1610). See ch. xxiv (C).\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT ARMIN (> 1588–1610 <). For biography see Actors (ch. xv).\r\n\r\n               _The Two Maids of Moreclacke. 1607–8_ (?)\r\n\r\n1609. The History of the two Maids of Moreclacke, With the life and\r\nsimple maner of Iohn in the Hospitall. Played by the Children of the\r\nKings Maiesties Reuels. Written by Robert Armin, seruant to the Kings\r\nmost excellent Maiestie. _N. O. for Thomas Archer._ [Epistle to Reader,\r\nsigned ‘Robert Armin’.]\r\n\r\n_Editions_ in A. B. Grosart, _Works of R. A. Actor_ (1880, _Choice\r\nRarities of Ancient English Poetry_, ii), 63, and J. S. Farmer (1913,\r\n_S. F. T._). The epistle says that the play was ‘acted by the boyes of\r\nthe Reuels, which perchaunce in part was sometime acted more naturally\r\nin the Citty, if not in the hole’, that the writer ‘would haue againe\r\ninacted Iohn my selfe but ... I cannot do as I would’, and that he had\r\nbeen ‘requested both of Court and Citty, to show him in priuate’. John\r\nis figured in a woodcut on the title-page, which is perhaps meant for\r\na portrait of Armin. As a King’s man, and no boy, he can hardly have\r\nplayed with the King’s Revels; perhaps we should infer that the play\r\nwas not originally written for them. All their productions seem to date\r\nfrom 1607–8.\r\n\r\n                            _Doubtful Play_\r\n\r\nArmin has been guessed at as the R. A. of _The Valiant Welshman_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS ASHTON (_ob._ 1578).\r\n\r\nAshton took his B.A. in 1559–60, and became Fellow of Trinity,\r\nCambridge. He was appointed Head Master of Shrewsbury School from 24\r\nJune 1561 (G. W. Fisher, _Annals of Shrewsbury School_, 4). To the\r\nsame year a local record, Robert Owen’s _Arms of the Bailiffs_ (17th\r\nc.), assigns ‘M^r Astons first playe upon the Passion of Christ’,\r\nand this is confirmed by an entry in the town accounts (Owen and\r\nBlakeway, _Hist. of Shrewsbury_, i. 353) of 20s. ‘spent upon M^r Aston\r\nand a other gentellmane of Cambridge over pareadijs’ on 25 May 1561.\r\nWhitsuntide plays had long been traditional at Shrewsbury (_Mediaeval\r\nStage_, ii. 250, 394, where the dates require correction). A local\r\nchronicle (_Shropshire Arch. Soc. Trans._ xxxvii. 54) has ‘Elizabeth\r\n1565 [i. e. 1566; cf. App. A], The Queen came to Coventry intending\r\nfor Salop to see M^r Astons Play, but it was ended. The Play was\r\nperformed in the Quarry, and lasted the Whitson [June 2] hollydays’.\r\nThis play is given in _Mediaeval Stage_, from local historians, as\r\n_Julian the Apostate_, but the same chronicle assigns that to 1556.\r\nAnother chronicle (_Taylor MS._ of 16th-17th c.) records for 1568–9\r\n(_Shropshire Arch. Soc. Trans._ iii. 268), ‘This yeare at Whytsoontyde\r\n[29 May] was a notable stage playe playeed in Shrosberie in a place\r\nthere callyd the quarrell which lastid all the hollydayes unto the\r\nwhich cam greate number of people of noblemen and others the which\r\nwas praysed greatlye and the chyff aucter therof was one Master Astoon\r\nbeinge the head scoolemaster of the freescole there a godly and lernyd\r\nman who tooke marvelous greate paynes therin’. Robert Owen, who calls\r\nthis Aston’s ‘great playe’ of the _Passion of Christ_, assigns it\r\nto 1568, but it is clear from the town accounts that 1569 is right\r\n(Fisher, 18). This is presumably the play referred to by Thomas\r\nChurchyard (q.v.) in _The Worthiness of Wales_ (1587, ed. Spenser Soc.\r\n85), where after describing ‘behind the walles ... a ground, newe\r\nmade Theator wise’, able to seat 10,000, and used for plays, baiting,\r\ncockfights, and wrestling, he adds:\r\n\r\n    At Astons Play, who had beheld this then,\r\n    Might well have seene there twentie thousand men.\r\n\r\nIn the margin he comments, ‘Maister Aston was a good and godly\r\nPreacher’. A ‘ludus in quarell’ is noted in 1495, and this was ‘where\r\nthe plases [? playes] have bine accustomyd to be usyd’ in 1570\r\n(_Mediaeval Stage_, ii. 251, 255). Ashton resigned his Mastership\r\nabout 1571 and was in the service of the Earl of Essex at Chartley in\r\n1573. But he continued to work on the Statutes of the school, which as\r\nsettled in 1578, the year of his death, provide that ‘Everie Thursdaie\r\nthe Schollers of the first forme before they goo to plaie shall for\r\nexercise declame and plaie one acte of a comedie’ (Fisher, 17, 23; E.\r\nCalvert, _Shrewsbury School Register_). It is interesting to note that\r\namong Ashton’s pupils were Sir Philip Sidney and Fulke Greville, Lord\r\nBrooke, who entered the school together on 16 Nov. 1564.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES ASKE (_c._ 1588).\r\n\r\nAuthor of _Elizabetha Triumphans_ (1588), an account of Elizabeth’s\r\nvisit to Tilbury. See ch. xxiv (C).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS ATCHELOW (_c._ 1589).\r\n\r\nThe reference to him in Nashe’s _Menaphon_ epistle (App. C, No. xlii)\r\nrather suggests that he may have written plays.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS BACON (1561–1626).\r\n\r\nBacon was son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper, by Anne, daughter\r\nof Sir Anthony Cooke. He was at Trinity, Cambridge, from April 1573\r\nto March 1575, and entered Gray’s Inn in June 1576. He sat in the\r\nParliaments of 1584 and 1586, and about 1591 attached himself to the\r\nrising fortunes of the Earl of Essex, who in 1595 gave him an estate\r\nat Twickenham. His public employment began as a Queen’s Counsel about\r\n1596. He was knighted on 23 July 1603, became Solicitor-General on 25\r\nJune 1607, Attorney-General on 27 Oct. 1613, Lord Keeper on 7 March\r\n1617, and Lord Chancellor on 7 Jan. 1618. He was created Lord Verulam\r\non 12 July 1618, and Viscount St. Albans on 27 Jan. 1621. Later in the\r\nsame year he was disgraced for bribery. The edition of his _Works_\r\n(with his _Letters and Life_) by J. Spedding, R. L. Ellis, and D. D.\r\nHeath (1857–74) is exhaustive. Many papers of his brother Anthony\r\nare at Lambeth, and are drawn on by T. Birch, _Memoirs of the Reign\r\nof Elizabeth_ (1754). F. J. Burgoyne, _Facsimile of a Manuscript at\r\nAlnwick_ (1904), reproduces the _Northumberland MS._ which contains\r\nsome of his writings, with others that may be his, and seems once to\r\nhave contained more. Apart from philosophy, his chief literary work was\r\n_The Essayes or Counsels, Civill and Morall_, of which 10 appeared in\r\n1597, and were increased to 38 in 1612 and 58 in 1625. Essay xxxvii,\r\nadded in 1625, is _Of Masks and Triumphs_, and, although Bacon was not\r\na writer for the public stage, he had a hand, as deviser or patron, in\r\nseveral courtly shows.\r\n\r\n(i) He helped to devise dumb-shows for Thomas Hughes’s _Misfortunes\r\nof Arthur_ (q.v.) given by Gray’s Inn at Greenwich on 28 Feb. 1588.\r\n\r\n(ii) The list of contents of the _Northumberland MS._ (Burgoyne, xii)\r\nincludes an item, now missing from the MS., ‘Orations at Graies Inne\r\nRevells’, and Spedding, viii. 342, conjectures that Bacon wrote the\r\nspeeches of the six councillors delivered on 3 Jan. 1595 as part of the\r\n_Gesta Grayorum_ (q.v.).\r\n\r\n(iii) Rowland Whyte (_Sydney Papers_, i. 362) describes a device on\r\nthe Queen’s day (17 Nov.), 1595, in which the speeches turned on the\r\nEarl of Essex’s love for Elizabeth, who said that, ‘if she had thought\r\nthere had been so much said of her, she would not have been there that\r\nnight’. A draft list of tilters, of whom the challengers were led\r\nby the Earl of Cumberland and the defendants by the Earl of Essex,\r\nis in _Various MSS._ iv. 163, and a final one, with descriptions of\r\ntheir appearance, in the _Anglorum Feriae_ of Peele (q.v.). They were\r\nCumberland, Knight of the Crown, Essex, Sussex, Southampton, as Sir\r\nBevis, Bedford, Compton, Carew, the three brothers Knollys, Dudley,\r\nWilliam Howard, Drury, Nowell, John Needham, Skydmore, Ratcliffe,\r\nReynolds, Charles Blount, Carey. The device took place partly in the\r\ntiltyard, partly after supper. Before the entry of the tilters a page\r\nmade a speech and secured the Queen’s glove. A dialogue followed\r\nbetween a Squire on one hand, and a Hermit, a Secretary, and a Soldier,\r\nwho on the entry of Essex tried to beguile him from love. A postboy\r\nbrought letters, which the Secretary gave to Essex. After supper,\r\nthe argument between the Squire and the three tempters was resumed.\r\nWhyte adds, ‘The old man [the Hermit] was he that in Cambridg played\r\nGiraldy; Morley played the Secretary; and he that plaid Pedantiq was\r\nthe soldior; and Toby Matthew acted the Squires part. The world makes\r\nmany untrue constructions of these speaches, comparing the Hermitt and\r\nthe Secretary to two of the Lords [Burghley and Robert Cecil?]; and the\r\nsoldier to Sir Roger Williams.’ The Cambridge reference is apparently\r\nto _Laelia_ (q.v.) and the performers of the Hermit and Soldier were\r\ntherefore George Meriton and George Mountaine, of Queen’s. Morley might\r\nperhaps be Thomas Morley, the musician, a Gentleman of the Chapel.\r\n\r\nSeveral speeches, apparently belonging to this device, are preserved.\r\nPeele speaks of the balancing of Essex between war and statecraft as\r\nindicated in the tiltyard by ‘His mute approach and action of his\r\nmutes’, but they may have presented a written speech.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Lambeth MS._ v. 118 (copied by Birch in _Sloane MS._ 4457, f.\r\n32) has, in Bacon’s hand, a speech by the Squire in the tiltyard, and\r\nfour speeches by the Hermit, Soldier, Secretary, and Squire ‘in the\r\nPresence’. These are printed by Birch (1763), Nichols, _Eliz._ iii.\r\n372, and Spedding, viii. 378.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Lambeth MS._ viii. 274 (copied by Birch in _Addl. MS._ 4164, f.\r\n167) has, in Bacon’s hand, the beginning of a speech by the Secretary\r\nto the Squire, which mentions Philautia and Erophilus, and a letter\r\nfrom Philautia to the Queen. These are printed in Spedding, viii. 376.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _Northumberland MS._ ff. 47–53 (Burgoyne, 55) has ‘Speeches\r\nfor my Lord of Essex at the tylt’. These deal with the attempts of\r\nPhilautia to beguile Erophilus. Four of them are identical with the\r\nfour speeches ‘in the Presence’ of (_a_); the fifth is a speech by the\r\nHermit in the tiltyard. They were printed by Spedding, separately, in\r\n1870, as _A Conference of Pleasure composed for some festive occasion\r\nabout the year 1592 by Francis Bacon_; but 1592 is merely a guess which\r\nWhyte’s letter corrects.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _S. P. D. Eliz._ ccliv. 67, 68, docketed ‘A Device made by the\r\nEarl of Essex for the Entertainment of her Majesty’, has a speech\r\nby the Squire, distinct from any in the other MSS., a speech by the\r\nAttendant on an Indian Prince, which mentions Philautia, and a draft by\r\nEdward Reynolds, servant to Essex, of a French speech by Philautia. The\r\ntwo first of these are printed by Spedding, viii. 388, and Devereux,\r\n_Lives of the Earls of Essex_, ii. 501. The references to Philautia are\r\nrather against Spedding’s view that these belong to some occasion other\r\nthan that of 1595.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Wotton says of Essex (_Reliquiae Wottonianae_, 21), ‘For his\r\nWritings, they are beyond example, especially in his ... things of\r\ndelight at Court ... as may be yet seen in his Impresses and Inventions\r\nof entertainment; and above all in his darling piece of love, and self\r\nlove’. This, for what it is worth--and Wotton was secretary to Essex\r\nin 1595, suggests that the Earl himself, rather than Bacon, was the\r\nauthor of the speeches, which in fact none of the MSS. directly ascribe\r\nto Bacon. But it is hard to distinguish the literary productions of a\r\npublic man from those of his staff.\r\n\r\n(iv) The _Northumberland MS._ (Burgoyne, 65) has a speech of apology\r\nfor absence, headed ‘ffor the Earle of Sussex at y^e tilt an: 96’,\r\nwhich might be Bacon’s, especially as he wrote from Gray’s Inn to the\r\nEarl of Shrewsbury on 15 Oct. 1596, ‘to borrow a horse and armour for\r\nsome public show’ (Lodge, _App._ 79).\r\n\r\n(v) Beaumont (q.v.) acknowledges his encouragement of the Inner Temple\r\nand Gray’s Inn mask on 20 Feb. 1613, for the Princess Elizabeth’s\r\nwedding.\r\n\r\n(vi) He bore the expenses of the Gray’s Inn _Mask of Flowers_ (q.v.)\r\non 6 Jan. 1614 for the Earl of Somerset’s wedding. To this occasion\r\nprobably belongs an undated letter signed ‘Fr. Bacon’, and addressed\r\nto an unknown lord (_M. S. C._ i. 214 from _Lansdowne MS._ 107, f.\r\n13; Spedding, ii. 370; iv. 394), in which he expresses regret that\r\n‘the joynt maske from the fowr Innes of Cowrt faileth’, and offers a\r\nmask for ‘this occasion’ by a dozen gentlemen of Gray’s Inn, ‘owt of\r\nthe honor which they bear to your lordship, and my lord Chamberlayne,\r\nto whome at theyr last maske they were so much bownde’. The last\r\nmask would be (v) above, and the then Lord Chamberlain was Suffolk,\r\nprospective father-in-law of Somerset, to whom the letter may be\r\nsupposed to be addressed. But it is odd that the letter is endorsed\r\n‘M^r’ Fr. Bacon, and bound up with papers of Burghley, and it is just\r\npossible, although not, I think, likely, that the reference may be to\r\nsome forgotten Elizabethan mask.\r\n\r\n(vii) A recent attempt has been made to assign to Bacon the academic\r\n_Pedantius_ (cf. App. K).\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BADGER (_c._ 1575).\r\n\r\nA contributor to the Kenilworth entertainment (cf. ch. xxiv, C).\r\nGascoigne calls him ‘Master Badger of Oxenforde, Maister of Arte, and\r\nBedle in the same Universitie’. A John Badger of Ch. Ch. took his M.A.\r\nin 1555, and a superior bedel of divinity of the same name made his\r\nwill on 15 July 1577 (Foster, _Alumni Oxonienses_, i. 54).\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BARKSTED.\r\n\r\nFor biography, cf. ch. xv (Actors), and for his share in _The Insatiate\r\nCountess_, s.v.

MS._ 38 (198).\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNABE BARNES (_c._ 1569–1609).\r\n\r\nBarnes was born in Yorkshire, the son of Richard Barnes, bishop of\r\nDurham. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1586, but took no\r\ndegree, accompanied Essex to France in 1591, and dedicated his poems\r\n_Parthenophil and Parthenophe_ (1593) to William Percy (q.v.). He was\r\na friend of Gabriel Harvey and abused by Nashe and Campion. In 1598\r\nhe was charged with an attempt at poison, but escaped from prison\r\n(_Athenaeum_, 1904, ii. 240). His _Poems_ were edited by A. B. Grosart\r\nin _Occasional Issues_ (1875). Hazlitt, _Manual_, 23, states that a\r\nmanuscript of a play by him with the title _The Battle of Hexham_ was\r\nsold with Isaac Reed’s books in 1807, but this, which some writers call\r\n_The Battle of Evesham_, has not been traced. As Barnes was buried\r\nat Durham in Dec. 1609, it is probable that _The Madcap_ ‘written by\r\nBarnes’, which Herbert licensed for Prince Charles’s men on 3 May 1624,\r\nwas by another of the name.\r\n\r\n                  _The Devil’s Charter. 2 Feb. 1607_\r\n\r\n_S.

Kirkman’s play-lists (Greg, _Masques_,\r\nci) and Wood, _Athenae Oxon._ ii. 655, have him as ‘Lord’ Barrey,\r\nwhich did not prevent Langbaine (1691) and others from turning him\r\ninto ‘Lodowick’.--_Dissertations_: J.

There are references\r\n(ed. Dodsley, pp. 280, 348, 369) to the baboons, which apparently\r\namused London about 1603–5 (cf. s.v. _Sir Giles Goosecap_), and to the\r\nJacobean knightings (p. 272).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS BEAUMONT (_c._ 1584–1616).\r\n\r\nBeaumont was third son of Francis Beaumont, Justice of Common Pleas,\r\nsprung from a gentle Leicestershire family, settled at Grace Dieu\r\npriory in Charnwood Forest. He was born in 1584 or 1585 and had a\r\nbrother, Sir John, also known as a poet. He entered Broadgates Hall,\r\nOxford, in 1597, but took no degree, and the Inner Temple in 1600. In\r\n1614 or 1615 he had a daughter by his marriage, probably recent, to\r\nUrsula Isley of Sundridge Hall, Kent, and another daughter was born\r\nafter his death on 6 March 1616. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nBeaumont contributed a humorous grammar lecture (preserved in _Sloane\r\nMS._ 1709, f. 13; cf. E. J. L. Scott in _Athenaeum_ for 27 Jan. 1894)\r\nto some Inner Temple Christmas revels of uncertain date. This has\r\nallusions to ‘the most plodderly plotted shew of Lady Amity’ given\r\n‘in this ill-instructed hall the last Christmas’, and to seeing a play\r\nat the Bankside for sixpence. His poetical career probably begins with\r\nthe anonymous _Salmacis and Hermaphroditus_ of 1602. His non-dramatic\r\npoems, of which the most important is an epistle to Elizabeth Countess\r\nof Rutland in 1612, appeared after his death in volumes of 1618,\r\n1640, and 1653, which certainly ascribe to him much that is not\r\nhis. His connexion with the stage seems to have begun about 1606,\r\npossibly through Michael Drayton, a family friend, in whose _Eglogs_\r\nof that year he appears as ‘sweet Palmeo’. But his first play, _The\r\nWoman Hater_, written independently for Paul’s, shows him under the\r\ninfluence of Ben Jonson, who wrote him an affectionate epigram (lv),\r\ntold Drummond in 1619 that ‘Francis Beaumont loved too much himself\r\nand his own verses’ (Laing, 10), and according to Dryden (_Essay on\r\nDramatick Poesie_) ‘submitted all his writings to his censure, and,\r\n’tis thought, used his judgment in correcting, if not contriving, all\r\nhis plots’. To Jonson’s _Volpone_ (1607) commendatory verses were\r\ncontributed both by Beaumont, whose own _Knight of the Burning Pestle_\r\nwas produced in the same year, and by John Fletcher, whose names are\r\nthus first combined. Jonson and Beaumont, in their turn, wrote verses\r\nfor Fletcher’s _The Faithful Shepherdess_, probably written in 1608 or\r\n1609 and published in 1609 or 1610. About 1608 or 1609 it may also be\r\nsupposed that the famous literary collaboration began. This, although\r\nit can only be proved to have covered some half-dozen plays, left the\r\ntwo names so closely associated that when, in 1647 and 1679, the actors\r\nand publishers issued collections of fifty-three pieces, in all or most\r\nof which Fletcher had had, or was supposed to have had, a hand, they\r\ndescribed them all as ‘by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher’, and thus\r\nleft to modern scholarship a task with which it is still grappling.\r\nA contemporary protest by Sir Aston Cockaine pointed out the small\r\nshare of Beaumont and the large share of Massinger in the 1647 volume;\r\nand the process of metrical analysis initiated by Fleay and Boyle\r\nmay be regarded as fairly successful in fixing the characteristics\r\nof the very marked style of Fletcher, although it certainly raises\r\nmore questions than it solves as to the possible shares not only of\r\nMassinger, but of Jonson, Field, Tourneur, Daborne, Middleton, Rowley,\r\nand Shirley, as collaborators or revisers, in the plays as they have\r\ncome down to us. Since Fletcher wrote up to his death in 1625, much of\r\nthis investigation lies outside my limits, and it is fortunate that\r\nthe task of selecting the plays which may, certainly or possibly,\r\nfall before Beaumont’s death in 1616 is one in which a fair number of\r\ndefinite data are available to eke out the slippery metrical evidence.\r\nIt would seem that the collaboration began about 1608 and lasted in\r\nfull swing for about four or five years, that in it Beaumont was the\r\nruling spirit, and that it covered plays, not only for the Queen’s\r\nRevels, for whom both poets had already written independently, and for\r\ntheir successors the Lady Elizabeth’s, but also, and concurrently,\r\nfor the King’s. According to Dryden, two or three plays were written\r\n‘very unsuccessfully’ before the triumph of _Philaster_, but these may\r\ninclude the independent plays, of which we know that the _Knight of\r\nthe Burning Pestle_ and the _Faithful Shepherdess_ failed. The Folios\r\ncontain a copy of verses written by Beaumont to Jonson (ed. Waller,\r\nx. 199) ‘before he and M^r. Fletcher came to _London_, with two of\r\nthe precedent Comedies then not finish’d, which deferr’d their merry\r\nmeetings at the _Mermaid_’, but this probably relates to a temporary\r\n_villeggiatura_ and cannot be precisely dated. It is no doubt to this\r\nperiod of 1608–13 that we may refer the gossip of Aubrey, i. 96, who\r\nlearnt from Sir James Hales and others that Beaumont and Fletcher\r\n‘lived together on the Banke-Side, not far from the Play-house, both\r\nbatchelors; lay together; had one wench in the house between them,\r\nwhich they did so admire; the same cloathes and cloake, &c., betweene\r\nthem’. Obviously these conditions ended when Beaumont married an\r\nheiress about 1613, and it seems probable that from this date onwards\r\nhe ceased to be an active playwright, although he contributed a mask to\r\nthe Princess Elizabeth’s wedding at Shrovetide of that year, and his\r\nhand can be traced, perhaps later still, in _The Scornful Lady_. At any\r\nrate, about 1613 Fletcher was not merely writing independent plays--a\r\npractice which, unlike Beaumont, he may never have wholly dropped--but\r\nalso looking about for other contributors. There is some converging\r\nevidence of his collaboration about this date with Shakespeare; and\r\nHenslowe’s correspondence (_Henslowe Papers_, 66) shows him quite\r\nclearly as engaged on a play, possibly _The Honest Man’s Fortune_, with\r\nno less than three others, Daborne, Field, and Massinger. It is not\r\nprobable that, from 1616 onwards, Fletcher wrote for any company but\r\nthe King’s men. Of the fifty-two plays included in the Ff., forty-four\r\ncan be shown from title-pages, actor-lists, licences by the Master\r\nof the Revels, and a Lord Chamberlain’s order of 1641 (_M. S. C._ i.\r\n364) to have belonged to the King’s, six by title-pages and another\r\nLord Chamberlain’s order (_Variorum_, iii. 159) to have belonged to\r\nthe Cockpit theatre, and two, _Wit at Several Weapons_ and _Four\r\nPlays in One_, together with _The Faithful Friends_, which does not\r\nappear in the Ff., cannot be assigned to any company. But some of the\r\nKing’s men’s plays and some or all of the Cockpit plays had originally\r\nbelonged to Paul’s, the Queen’s Revels, or the Lady Elizabeth’s, and\r\nit is probable that all these formed part of the Lady Elizabeth’s\r\nrepertory in 1616, and that upon the reorganization of the company\r\nwhich then took place they were divided into two groups, of which one\r\npassed with Field to the King’s, while the other remained with his late\r\nfellows and was ultimately left with Christopher Beeston when their\r\noccupation of the Cockpit ended in 1625.\r\n\r\nI classify the plays dealt with in these notes as follows: (_a_)\r\nPlays wholly or substantially by Beaumont--_The Woman Hater_, _The\r\nKnight of the Burning Pestle_; (_b_) Plays of the Beaumont-Fletcher\r\ncollaboration--_Philaster_, _A Maid’s Tragedy_, _A King and No King_,\r\n_Four Plays in One_, _Cupid’s Revenge_, _The Coxcomb_, _The Scornful\r\nLady_; (_c_) Plays wholly or substantially by Fletcher--_The Woman’s\r\nPrize_, _The Faithful Shepherdess_, _Monsieur Thomas_, _Valentinian_,\r\n_Bonduca_, _Wit Without Money_; (_d_) Plays of doubtful authorship\r\nand, in some cases, period--_The Captain_, _The Honest Man’s\r\nFortune_, _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, _The Faithful Friends_, _Thierry\r\nand Theodoret_, _Wit at Several Weapons_, _Love’s Cure_, _The Night\r\nWalker_. Full treatment of _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, as of _Henry VIII_,\r\nin which Fletcher certainly had a hand, is only possible in relation\r\nto Shakespeare. I have not thought it necessary to include every play\r\nwhich, or a hypothetical version of which, an unsupported conjecture,\r\ngenerally from Mr. Oliphant, puts earlier than 1616. _The Queen of\r\nCorinth_, _The Noble Gentleman_, _The Little French Lawyer_, _The Laws\r\nof Candy_, _The Knight of Malta_, _The Fair Maid of the Inn_, _The\r\nChances_, _Beggar’s Bush_, _The Bloody Brother_, _Love’s Pilgrimage_,\r\n_Nice Valour_, and _Rule a Wife and Have a Wife_ are omitted on\r\nthis principle, and I believe I might safely have extended the same\r\ntreatment to some of those in my class (_d_).\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n_S.

Neither argument is convincing, and\r\nit is not known that the Paul’s boys went on into 1607; they are last\r\nheard of in July 1606. The prologue expresses the author’s intention\r\nnot to lose his ears, perhaps an allusion to Jonson’s and Chapman’s\r\nperil after _Eastward Ho!_ in 1605. Gayley notes in II. iii what\r\ncertainly looks like a reminiscence of _Antony and Cleopatra_, IV. xiv.\r\n51 and xv. 87, but it is no easier to be precise about the date of\r\n_Antony and Cleopatra_ than about that of _The Woman Hater_. The play\r\nis universally regarded as substantially Beaumont’s and the original\r\nprologue only speaks of a single author, but Davenant in 1649 evidently\r\nsupposed it to be Fletcher’s, saying ‘full twenty yeares, he wore the\r\nbayes’. Boyle, Oliphant, Alden, and Gayley suggest among them III.\r\ni, ii; IV. ii; V. i, ii, v as scenes to which Fletcher or some other\r\ncollaborator may have given touches.\r\n\r\n               _The Knight of the Burning Pestle. 1607_\r\n\r\n1613.

Murch (1908, _Yale\r\nStudies_, xxxiii), R. M. Alden (1910, _B. L._), W. A. Neilson (1911,\r\n_C. E. D._).--_Dissertations_: R. Boyle, _B. and F.’s K. B. P._ (1889,\r\n_E. S._ xiii. 156); B. Leonhardt, _Ueber B. und F.’s K. B. P._ (1885,\r\n_Annaberg programme_), _Die Text-Varianten von B. und F.’s K. B. P._\r\n(1896, _Anglia_, xix. 509).\r\n\r\nThe Epistle tells us that the play was ‘in eight daies ... begot and\r\nborne’, ‘exposed to the wide world, who ... utterly reiected it’,\r\npreserved by Keysar and sent to Burre, who had ‘fostred it priuately\r\nin my bosome these two yeares’. The play ‘hopes his father will beget\r\nhim a yonger brother’. Burre adds, ‘Perhaps it will be thought to bee\r\nof the race of Don Quixote: we both may confidently sweare, it is his\r\nelder aboue a yeare’. The references to the actors in the induction\r\nas boys and the known connexion of Keysar with the Queen’s Revels\r\nfix the company. The date is more difficult. It cannot be earlier\r\nthan 1607, since the reference to a play at the Red Bull in which the\r\nSophy of Persia christens a child (IV. i. 46) is to Day’s _Travels of\r\nThree English Brothers_ of that year. With other allusions, not in\r\nthemselves conclusive, 1607 would agree well enough, notably with Ind.\r\n8, ‘This seuen yeares there hath beene playes at this house’, for it\r\nwas just seven years in the autumn of 1607 since Evans set up plays\r\nat the Blackfriars. The trouble is IV. i. 73, ‘Read the play of the\r\n_Foure Prentices of London_, where they tosse their pikes so’, for this\r\nimplies that the _Four Prentices_ was not merely produced but in print,\r\nand the earliest extant edition is of 1615. It is, however, quite\r\npossible that the play may have been in print, even as far back as\r\n1594 (cf. s.v. Heywood). Others put it, and with it the _K. B. P._, in\r\n1610, in which case the production would have been at the Whitefriars,\r\nthe history of which can only be traced back two or three years and\r\nnot seven years before 1610. On the whole, I think the reference to\r\n_Don Quixote_ in the Epistle is in favour of 1607 rather than 1610.\r\nIt is, of course, conceivable that Burre only meant to claim that the\r\n_K. B. P._ was a year older than Thomas Shelton’s translation of _Don\r\nQuixote_, which was entered in _S. R._ on 19 Jan. 1611 and published\r\nin 1612. Even this brings us back to the very beginning of 1610, and\r\nthe boast would have been a fairly idle one, as Shelton states in his\r\npreface that the translation was actually made ‘some five or six yeares\r\nagoe’. Shelton’s editor, Mr. Fitzmaurice-Kelly, has shown that it was\r\nbased on the Brussels edition of 1607. If we put it in 1608 and the _K.\r\nB. P._ in 1607 the year’s priority of the latter is preserved. Most\r\ncertainly the _K. B. P._ was not prior to the Spanish _Don Quixote_ of\r\n1605. Its dependence on Cervantes is not such as necessarily to imply\r\nthat Beaumont had read the romance, but he had certainly heard of its\r\ngeneral drift and of the particular episodes of the inn taken for a\r\ncastle and the barber’s basin. Fleay, Boyle, Moorman, Murch, and Alden\r\nare inclined to assign to Fletcher some or all of the scenes in which\r\nJasper and Luce and Humphrey take part; but Macaulay, Oliphant and\r\nGayley regard the play, except perhaps for a touch or two, as wholly\r\nBeaumont’s. Certainly the Epistle suggests that the play had but one\r\n‘father’.\r\n\r\n                  _The Faithful Shepherdess. 1608–9_\r\n\r\nN.D. The Faithfull Shepherdesse. By John Fletcher. _For R.

This gives us the date\r\n1608–9, which there is nothing to contradict. The undated Q_{1} may\r\nbe put in 1609 or 1610, as Skipwith died on 3 May 1610 and the short\r\npartnership of the publishers is traceable from 22 Dec. 1608 to 14 Jan.\r\n1610. It is, moreover, in Sir John Harington’s catalogue of his plays,\r\nwhich was made up in 1609 or 1610 (cf. ch. xxii). The presence of\r\nField, Chapman, and Jonson amongst the verse-writers and the mentions\r\nin Beaumont’s verses of ‘the waxlights’ and of a boy dancing between\r\nthe acts point to the Queen’s Revels as the producers. It is clear also\r\nfrom the verses that the play was damned, and that Fletcher alone, in\r\nspite of Drummond’s report, was the author. This is not doubted on\r\ninternal grounds.\r\n\r\n           _The Woman’s Prize, or, The Tamer Tamed. 1604 <_\r\n\r\n1647. The Womans Prize, or The Tamer Tam’d. A Comedy.

[Part of F_{2}.]\r\n\r\nFleay, i. 198, Oliphant, and Thorndike, 70, accumulate inconclusive\r\nevidence bearing on the date, of which the most that can be said is\r\nthat an answer to _The Taming of the Shrew_ would have more point the\r\nnearer it came to the date of the original, and that the references to\r\nthe siege of Ostend in I. iii would be topical during or not long after\r\nthat siege, which ended on 8 Sept. 1604. On the other hand, Gayley\r\n(_R. E. C._ iii, lxvi) calls attention to possible reminiscences of\r\n_Epicoene_ (_1609_) and _Alchemist_ (_1610_). I see no justification\r\nfor supposing that a play written in 1605 would undergo revision,\r\nas has been suggested, in 1610–14. A revival by the King’s in 1633\r\ngot them into some trouble with Sir Henry Herbert, who claimed the\r\nright to purge even an old play of ‘oaths, prophaness, and ribaldrye’\r\n(_Variorum_, iii. 208). Possibly the play is also _The Woman is too\r\nHard for Him_, which the King’s took to Court on 26 Nov. 1621 (Murray,\r\nii. 193). But the original writing was not necessarily for this\r\ncompany. There is general agreement in assigning the play to Fletcher\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n                          _Philaster > 1610_\r\n\r\n_S.

R._ 8 Oct. 1610), ep. 206:\r\n\r\n      _To the well deseruing_ M^r John Fletcher.\r\n    _Loue lies ableeding_, if it should not proue\r\n    Her vttmost art to shew why it doth loue.\r\n    Thou being the _Subiect_ (now) It raignes vpon:\r\n    Raign’st in _Arte_, _Iudgement_, and _Inuention_:\r\n      _For this I loue thee: and can doe no lesse_\r\n      _For thine as faire, as faithfull_ Shepheardesse.\r\n\r\nIf so, the date 1608–10 is suggested, and I do not think that it is\r\npossible to be more precise. No trustworthy argument can be based with\r\nGayley, 342, on the fact that Davies’s epigram follows that praising\r\nOstler as ‘Roscius’ and ‘sole king of actors’; and I fear that the\r\nview of Thorndike, 65, that 1608 is a ‘probable’ conjecture is biased\r\nby a desire to assume priority to _Cymbeline_. There were two Court\r\nperformances in the winter of 1612–13, and Fleay, i. 189, suggests\r\nthat the versions of I. i and V. iv, v which appear in Q_{1} were\r\nmade for these. The epistle to Q_{2} describes them as ‘dangerous and\r\ngaping wounds ... received in the first impression’. There is general\r\nagreement that most of the play, whether Davies knew it or not, is\r\nBeaumont’s. Most critics assign V. iii, iv and some the whole or parts\r\nof I. i, ii, II. ii, iv, and III. ii to Fletcher.\r\n\r\n                      _The Coxcomb. 1608 < > 10_\r\n\r\n1647. The Coxcomb.

N._ xvii. 179).\r\n\r\nThe play was given at Court by the Queen’s Revels on 2 or 3 Nov.\r\n1612. It passed, doubtless, through the Lady Elizabeth’s, to whom the\r\nactor-list probably belongs, to the King’s, who took it to Court on 5\r\nMarch 1622 (Murray, ii. 193) and again on 17 Nov. 1636 (Cunningham,\r\nxxiv). There was thus more than one opportunity for the prologue, which\r\nspeaks of the play as having a mixed reception at first, partly because\r\nof its length, then ‘long forgot’, and now revived and shortened. The\r\noriginal date may be between the issue in 1608 of Baudouin’s French\r\ntranslation of _The Curious Impertinent_ from _Don Quixote_, which in\r\noriginal or translation suggested its plot, and Jonson’s _Alchemist_\r\n(1610), IV. vii. 39, ‘You are ... a Don Quixote. Or a Knight o’ the\r\ncurious coxcombe’. The prologue refers to ‘makers’, and there is fair\r\nagreement in giving some or all of I. iv, vi, II. iv, III. iii, and V.\r\nii to Beaumont and the rest to Fletcher. Fleay, Boyle, Oliphant, and\r\nGayley think that there has been revision by a later writer, perhaps\r\nMassinger or W. Rowley.\r\n\r\n                      _The Maid’s Tragedy > 1611_\r\n\r\n_S.

T._ (1900, _Anglia_, xxiii. 14).\r\n\r\nThe play must have been known by 31 Oct. 1611 when Buck named the\r\n_Second Maiden’s Tragedy_ (q.v.) after it, and it was given at Court\r\nduring 1612–13. An inferior limit is not attainable and any date within\r\n_c._ 1608–11 is possible. Gayley, 349, asks us to accept the play as\r\nmore mature than, and therefore later than, _Philaster_. Fleay, i. 192,\r\nthinks that the mask in I. ii was added after the floods in the winter\r\nof 1612, but you cannot bring Neptune into a mask without mention of\r\nfloods. As to authorship there is some division of opinion, especially\r\non II. ii and IV. iii; subject thereto, a balance of opinion gives I,\r\nII, III, IV. ii, iv and V. iv to Beaumont, and only IV. i and V. i, ii,\r\niii to Fletcher.\r\n\r\nAn episode (I. ii) consists of a mask at the wedding of Amintor and\r\nEvadne, with an introductory dialogue between Calianax, Diagoras, who\r\nkeeps the doors, and guests desiring admission. ‘The ladies are all\r\nplaced above,’ says Diagoras, ‘save those that come in the King’s\r\ntroop.’ Calianax has an ‘office’, evidently as Chamberlain. ‘He would\r\nrun raging among them, and break a dozen wiser heads than his own in\r\nthe twinkling of an eye.’\r\n\r\nThe maskers are Proteus and other sea-gods; the presenters Night,\r\nCinthia, Neptune, Aeolus, Favonius, and other winds, who ‘rise’ or come\r\n‘out of a rock’. There are two ‘measures’ between hymeneal songs, but\r\nno mention of taking out ladies.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier passage (I. i. 9) a poet says of masks, ‘They must\r\ncommend their King, and speak in praise Of the Assembly, bless the\r\nBride and Bridegroom, In person of some God; th’are tyed to rules Of\r\nflattery’.\r\n\r\n                      _A King and No King. 1611_\r\n\r\n_S.

Herbert records (_Var._ iii. 263) that it was\r\n‘allowed to be acted in 1611’ by Sir George Buck. It was in fact acted\r\nat Court by the King’s on 26 Dec. 1611 and again during 1612–13. A\r\nperformance at Hampton Court on 10 Jan. 1637 is also upon record\r\n(Cunningham, xxv). The epistle, which tells us that the publisher\r\nreceived the play from Nevill, speaks of ‘the authors’ and of their\r\n‘future labours’; rather oddly, as Beaumont was dead. There is\r\npractical unanimity in assigning I, II, III, IV. iv, and V. ii, iv to\r\nBeaumont and IV. i, ii, iii and V. i, iii to Fletcher.\r\n\r\n                       _Cupid’s Revenge > 1612_\r\n\r\n_S.

It was revived by the\r\nLady Elizabeth’s at Court on 28 Dec. 1624, and is in the Cockpit list\r\nof 1639. It cannot therefore be later than 1611–12, while no close\r\ninferior limit can be fixed. Fleay, i. 187, argues that it has been\r\naltered for Court, chiefly by turning a wicked king, queen, and prince\r\ninto a duke, duchess, and marquis. I doubt if this implies revision\r\nas distinct from censorship, and in any case it does not, as Fleay\r\nsuggests, imply the intervention of a reviser other than the original\r\nauthors. The suggestion has led to chaos in the distribution of\r\nauthorship, since various critics have introduced Daborne, Field, and\r\nMassinger as possible collaborators or revisers. The stationer speaks\r\nof a single ‘author’, meaning Fletcher, but says he was ‘not acquainted\r\nwith him’. And the critics at least agree in finding both Beaumont and\r\nFletcher, pretty well throughout.\r\n\r\n                      _The Captain. 1609 < > 12_\r\n\r\n1647. The Captain. [Part of F_{1}.

The 1679 print, by a confusion, gives the scene as\r\n‘Venice, Spain’, but this hardly justifies the suggestion of Fleay, i.\r\n195, that we have a version of Fletcher’s work altered for the Court\r\nby Barnes. He had formerly conjectured collaboration between Fletcher\r\nand Jonson (_E. S._ ix. 18). The prologue speaks of ‘the author’;\r\nFleay thinks that the mention of ‘twelve pence’ as the price of a seat\r\nindicates a revival. Several critics find Massinger; Oliphant finds\r\nRowley; and Boyle and Oliphant find Beaumont, as did Macaulay, 196, in\r\n1883, but apparently not in 1910 (_C.

Att the intreaty of Mr. .’ The last word is\r\ntorn off, but a third hand has added ‘Taylor’. The MS. contains some\r\nalterations, partly by the licenser, partly by the stage-manager or\r\nprompter. The latter include the names of three actors, ‘G[eorge]\r\nVer[non]’, ‘J: R Cro’ and ‘G. Rick’. The ending of the last scene in\r\nthe MS. differs from that of the Ff. The endorsement is confirmed by\r\nHerbert’s entry in his diary (_Variorum_, iii. 229), ‘For the King’s\r\ncompany. An olde play called The Honest Mans Fortune, the originall\r\nbeing lost, was re-allowed by mee at M^r. Taylor’s intreaty, and on\r\ncondition to give mee a booke [The Arcadia], this 8 Februa. 1624.’ The\r\nactor-list suggests that the original performers were Lady Elizabeth’s\r\nmen, after the Queen’s Revels had joined them in March 1613. Fleay,\r\ni. 196, suggests that this is the play by Fletcher, Field, Massinger,\r\nand Daborne which is the subject of some of Henslowe’s correspondence\r\nand was finally delivered on 5 Aug. 1613 (Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, 65,\r\n90). Attempts to combine this indication with stylistic evidence have\r\nled the critics to some agreement that Fletcher is only responsible\r\nfor V and that Massinger is to be found in III, and for the rest into\r\na quagmire of conjecture amongst the names of Beaumont, Fletcher,\r\nMassinger, Field, Daborne, Tourneur, and Cartwright. The appended\r\nverses of the Ff. are not in the _Dyce MS._, but they are in _Addl.\r\nMS._ 25707, f. 66, and _Bodl. Rawlinson Poet.

The authorship is generally regarded as\r\nsubstantially Fletcher’s; and the occasional use of rhyme in II. i and\r\nIV. iv hardly justifies Oliphant’s theory of an earlier version by\r\nBeaumont, or the ascription by Fleay and Macaulay of these scenes to\r\nField, whose connexion with the King’s does not seem to antedate 1616.\r\n\r\n                    _Monsieur Thomas. 1610 < > 16_\r\n\r\n_S.

Hatcher,\r\n_The Sources of Fletcher’s Monsieur Thomas_ (1907, _Anglia_, xxx. 89).\r\n\r\nThe title-page printed at the time of the revival by the King’s men\r\nof the Restoration enables us to identify _Monsieur Thomas_ with the\r\n_Father’s Own Son_ of the Cockpit repertory in 1639, and like the\r\nother plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher series in that repertory it\r\nwas probably written by 1616, and either for the Queen’s Revels or\r\nfor the Lady Elizabeth’s. An allusion in II. iii. 104 to ‘all the\r\nfeathers in the Friars’ might indicate production at Porter’s Hall in\r\nthe Blackfriars about that year. The play cannot be earlier than its\r\nsource, Part ii (1610) of H. d’Urfé’s _Astrée_, and by 1610 the more\r\npermanent Blackfriars house had passed to the King’s, by whom the\r\nperformances referred to on the original title-page must therefore\r\nhave been given. Perhaps the explanation is that there had been some\r\nmisunderstanding about the distribution of the Lady Elizabeth’s men’s\r\nplays between the King’s and the Cockpit, and that a revival by the\r\nKing’s in 1639 led the Cockpit managers to get the Lord Chamberlain’s\r\norder of 10 Aug. 1639 (_Variorum_, iii. 159) appropriating their\r\nrepertory to them.

There is general agreement in assigning the play\r\nto Fletcher alone. It passed into the Cockpit repertory and was played\r\nthere both by Queen Henrietta’s men and in 1637 by Beeston’s boys\r\n(_Variorum_, iii. 159, 239).

Bond (1904, Bullen, i).\r\n\r\nReferences to ‘talk of the Cleve wars’ (V. iii. 66) and ‘some cast\r\nCleve captain’ (V. iv. 54) cannot be earlier than 1609 when the wars\r\nbroke out after the death of the Duke of Cleves on 25 March, and there\r\ncan hardly have been ‘cast’ captains until some time after July 1610\r\nwhen English troops first took part. Fleay, i. 181, calls attention to\r\nan allusion to the binding by itself of the Apocrypha (I. ii. 46) which\r\nwas discussed for the A. V. and the Douay Version, both completed in\r\n1610; and Gayley to a reminiscence (IV. i. 341) of _Epicoene_ which,\r\nhowever, was acted in 1609, not, as Gayley thinks, 1610. None of these\r\nindications, however, are of much importance in view of another traced\r\nby Gayley (III. ii. 17):\r\n\r\n      I will style thee noble, nay, Don Diego;\r\n    I’ll woo thy infanta for thee.\r\n\r\nDon Diego Sarmiento’s negotiations for a Spanish match with Prince\r\nCharles began on 27 May 1613. The play must therefore be 1613–16. In\r\nany case the ‘Blackfriars’ of the title-page must be the Porter’s Hall\r\nhouse of 1615–17. Even if the end of 1609 were a possible date, Murray,\r\ni. 153, is wrong in supposing that the Revels were then at Blackfriars.\r\nThere is fair unanimity in assigning I, the whole or part of II, and V.\r\nii to Beaumont, and the rest to Fletcher, but Bond and Gayley suggest\r\nthat III. i, at least, might be Massinger’s.\r\n\r\n                      _Thierry and Theodoret (?)_\r\n\r\n1621.

Leonhardt, _Die Text-Varianten von B. und F.’s T.\r\nand T._ (1903, _Anglia_, xxvi. 345).\r\n\r\nFleay, i. 205, dates the play _c._ 1617, supposing it to be a satire\r\non the French Court, and the name De Vitry to be that of the slayer\r\nof the Maréchal d’Ancre. Thorndike, 79, has little difficulty in\r\ndisposing of this theory, although it may be pointed out that the Privy\r\nCouncil did in fact intervene to suppress a play about the Maréchal\r\nin 1617 (Gildersleeve, 113); but he is less successful in attempting\r\nto show any special plausibility in a date as early as 1607. A former\r\nconjecture by Fleay (_E. S._ ix. 21) that III and V. i are fragments of\r\nthe anonymous _Branholt_ of the Admiral’s in 1597 may also be dismissed\r\nwith Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 188). Most critics find, in addition to\r\nFletcher, Massinger, as collaborator or reviser, according to the\r\ndate given to the play, and some add Field or Daborne. Oliphant and\r\nThorndike find Beaumont. So did Macaulay, 196, in 1883, but apparently\r\nnot in 1910 (_C. H._ vi. 138).\r\n\r\n               _The Nightwalker or The Little Thief (?)_\r\n\r\n_S.

The only justification for\r\nplacing Fletcher’s version earlier than 1616 is the suspicion that\r\nthe only plays of Beaumont or Fletcher which passed to the Cockpit\r\nrepertory were some of those written for the Queen’s Revels or the Lady\r\nElizabeth’s before that date.\r\n\r\n                        _Four Plays in One (?)_\r\n\r\n1647.

J. Lawrence, _The Date of F. P. in O._ (_T. L. S._\r\n11 Dec. 1919).\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to have passed to the King’s men or the Cockpit, and\r\ncannot be assigned to any particular company. It has been supposed to\r\nbe a boys’ play, presumably because it has much music and dancing. It\r\nhas also much pageantry in dumb-shows and so forth and stage machinery.\r\nConceivably it might have been written for private performance in\r\nplace of a mask. _Time_, in particular, has much the form of a mask,\r\nwith antimask. But composite plays of this type were well known on the\r\npublic stage. There is no clear indication of date. Fleay, i. 179,\r\nsuggested 1608 because _The Yorkshire Tragedy_, printed that year, is\r\nalso described in its heading as ‘one of the Four Plays in One’, but\r\npresumably it belonged to another series. Thorndike, 85, points out\r\nthat the antimask established itself in Court masks in 1608. Gayley,\r\n301, puts _Death_ and _Time_ in 1610, because he thinks that they fall\r\nstylistically between _The Faithfull Shepherdess_ and _Philaster_, and\r\nthe rest in 1612, because he thinks they are Field’s and that they\r\ncannot be before 1611, since they are not mentioned, like _Amends for\r\nLadies_, as forthcoming in the epistle to _Woman a Weathercock_ in that\r\nyear. This hardly bears analysis, and indeed Field is regarded as the\r\nauthor of the Induction and _Honour_ only by Oliphant and Gayley and\r\nof _Love_ only by Gayley himself. All these are generally assigned to\r\nBeaumont, and _Death_ and _Time_ universally to Fletcher. Lawrence’s\r\nattempt to attach the piece to the wedding festivities of 1612–13 does\r\nnot seem to me at all convincing.\r\n\r\n                _Love’s Cure; or, The Martial Maid_ (?)\r\n\r\n1647.

Stiefel, _Die Nachahmung spanischer Komödien in\r\nEngland_ (1897, _Archiv_, xcix. 271).\r\n\r\nThe prologue, evidently later than Fletcher’s death in 1625, clearly\r\nassigns the authorship to Beaumont and Fletcher, although the epilogue,\r\nof uncertain date, speaks of ‘our author’. This is the only sound\r\nreason for thinking that the original composition was in Beaumont’s\r\nlifetime. The internal evidence for an early date cited by Fleay, i.\r\n180, and Thorndike, 72, becomes trivial when we eliminate what merely\r\nfixes the historic time of the play to 1604–9, and proves nothing as to\r\nthe time of composition. On the other hand, II. ii,\r\n\r\n                  the cold Muscovite ...\r\n    That lay here lieger in the last great frost,\r\n\r\npoints to a date later than the winter of 1621, as I cannot trace any\r\nearlier great frost in which a Muscovite embassy can have been in\r\nLondon (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, cxxiii, 11, 100; cxxiv. 40). Further, the\r\ncritics seem confident that the dominant hand in the play as it exists\r\nis Massinger’s, and that Beaumont and Fletcher show, if at all, faintly\r\nthrough his revision. The play belonged to the repertory of the King’s\r\nmen by 1641 (_M. S. C._ i. 364).\r\n\r\n                     _Wit at Several Weapons_ (?)\r\n\r\n1647. Wit at several weapons. A Comedy.

It is neither in the Cockpit\r\nrepertory of 1639 nor in that of the King’s in 1641, and the guesses\r\nof Fleay, i. 218, that it may be _The Devil of Dowgate or Usury Put\r\nto Use_, licensed by Herbert for the King’s on 17 Oct. 1623, and _The\r\nBuck is a Thief_, played at Court by the same men on 28 Dec. 1623, are\r\nunsupported and mutually destructive. The epilogue, clearly written\r\nafter the death of Fletcher, tells us that ‘’twas well receiv’d before’\r\nand that Fletcher ‘had to do in’ it, and goes on to qualify this by\r\nadding--\r\n\r\n                        that if he but writ\r\n    An Act, or two, the whole Play rose up wit.\r\n\r\nThe critics find varying amounts of Fletcher, with work of other\r\nhands, which some of them venture to identify as those of Middleton\r\nand Rowley. Oliphant, followed by Thorndike, 87, finds Beaumont, and\r\nthe latter points to allusions which are not inconsistent with, but\r\ncertainly do not prove, 1609–10, or even an earlier date. Macaulay,\r\n196, also found Beaumont in 1883, but seems to have retired upon\r\nMiddleton and Rowley in 1910 (_C. H._ vi. 138).\r\n\r\n                      _The Faithful Friends_ (?)\r\n\r\n[_MS._] _Dyce MS._ 10, formerly in the Heber collection.\r\n\r\n_S.

S._ xiii. 32) saw evidence of a date in 1614 in\r\ncertain possible allusions (I. i. 45–52, 123–6) to the Earl of Somerset\r\nand his wedding on 26 Dec. 1613, and suggested Field and Daborne as the\r\nauthors. In 1891 (i. 81, 201) he gave the whole to Daborne, except IV.\r\nv, which he thought of later date, and supposed it to be the subject\r\nof Daborne’s letter of 11 March 1614 to Henslowe, which was in fact\r\nprobably _The Owl_ (Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, 82). Oliphant thinks it\r\na revision by Massinger and Field in 1614 of a play by Beaumont and\r\nFletcher, perhaps as early as 1604. With this exception no critic seems\r\nmuch to believe in the presence of Beaumont or Fletcher, and Boyle,\r\nwho suggests Shirley, points out that the allusion in I. i. 124 to the\r\nrelation between Philip III and the Duke of Lerma as in the past would\r\ncome more naturally after Philip’s death in 1621 or at least after\r\nLerma’s disgrace in 1618. The MS. is in various hands, one of which has\r\nmade corrections. Some of these seem on internal evidence to have been\r\ndue to suggestions of the censor, others to play-house exigencies.\r\n\r\n                              _Lost Play_\r\n\r\nAmong plays entered in S.

The Hall was\r\noriginally appointed, and on Shrove-Tuesday, 16 Feb., the mask came\r\nby water from Winchester House in the royal barge, attended by many\r\ngentlemen of the Inns in other barges. They landed at the Privy Stairs,\r\nwatched by the King and princes from the Privy Gallery, and were\r\nconducted to the Vestry. But the actual mask was put off until 20 Feb.,\r\nin view of the press in the Hall, and then given in Banqueting House.\r\nBeaumont’s description passes lightly over this _contretemps_, but\r\ncf. _infra_.\r\n\r\nThe ‘fabricke’ was a mountain, with separate ‘traverses’ discovering\r\nits lower and its higher slopes. From the former issued the presenters\r\nand antimasks, whose ‘measures’ were both encored by the King, but\r\nunluckily ‘one of the Statuaes by that time was undressed’. The latter\r\nbore the ‘maine masque’ in two pavilions before the altar of Jupiter.\r\nThe maskers descended, danced two measures, then took their ladies to\r\ndance galliards, durets, corantoes, &c., then danced ‘their parting\r\nmeasure’ and ascended.\r\n\r\nPhineas Pett, Master of the Shipwrights’ Company in 1613, relates\r\n(_Archaeologia_, xii. 266) that he was\r\n\r\n   ‘intreated by divers gentlemen of the inns of business, whereof\r\n   Sir Francis Bacon was chief, to attend the bringing of a mask\r\n   by water in the night from St. Mary Over’s to Whitehall in some\r\n   of the gallies; but the tide falling out very contrary and the\r\n   company attending the maskers very unruly, the project could not\r\n   be performed so exactly as was purposed and expected. But yet\r\n   they were safely landed at the plying stairs at Whitehall, for\r\n   which my paines the gentlemen gave me a fair recompence.’\r\n\r\nChamberlain (Birch, i. 227) says:\r\n\r\n   ‘On Tuesday it came to Gray’s Inn and the Inner Temple’s turn to\r\n   come with their mask, whereof Sir Francis Bacon was the chief\r\n   contriver; and because the former came on horseback and in open\r\n   chariots, they made choice to come by water from Winchester\r\n   Place, in Southwark, which suited well with their device, which\r\n   was the marriage of the river of Thames to the Rhine; and their\r\n   show by water was very gallant, by reason of infinite store\r\n   of lights, very curiously set and placed, and many boats and\r\n   barges, with devices of light and lamps, with three peals of\r\n   ordnance, one at their taking water, another in the Temple\r\n   garden, and the last at their landing; which passage by water\r\n   cost them better than three hundred pounds. They were received\r\n   at the Privy Stairs, and great expectation there was that they\r\n   should every way excel their competitors that went before them;\r\n   both in device, daintiness of apparel, and, above all, in\r\n   dancing, wherein they are held excellent, and esteemed for the\r\n   properer men. But by what ill planet it fell out, I know not,\r\n   they came home as they went, without doing anything; the reason\r\n   whereof I cannot yet learn thoroughly, but only that the hall\r\n   was so full that it was not possible to avoid it, or make room\r\n   for them; besides that, most of the ladies were in the galleries\r\n   to see them land, and could not get in.\r\n\r\n   But the worst of all was, that the King was so wearied and\r\n   sleepy, with sitting up almost two whole nights before, that he\r\n   had no edge to it. Whereupon, Sir Francis Bacon adventured to\r\n   entreat of his majesty that by this difference he would not, as\r\n   it were, bury them quick; and I hear the King should answer,\r\n   that then they must bury him quick, for he could last no longer,\r\n   but withal gave them very good words, and appointed them to come\r\n   again on Saturday. But the grace of their mask is quite gone,\r\n   when their apparel hath been already showed, and their devices\r\n   vented, so that how it will fall out God knows, for they are\r\n   much discouraged and out of countenance, and the world says it\r\n   comes to pass after the old proverb, the properer man the worse\r\n   luck.’\r\n\r\nIn a later letter (Birch, i. 229) Chamberlain concludes the story:\r\n\r\n   ‘And our Gray’s Inn men and the Inner Templars were nothing\r\n   discouraged, for all the first dodge, but on Saturday last\r\n   performed their parts exceeding well and with great applause and\r\n   approbation, both from the King and all the company.’\r\n\r\nIn a third letter, to Winwood (iii, 435), he describes the adventures\r\nof the mask more briefly, and adds the detail that the performance was\r\n\r\n   ‘in the new bankquetting house, which for a kind of amends was\r\n   granted to them, though with much repining and contradiction of\r\n   their emulators.’\r\n\r\nChamberlain refers to the ‘new’ room of 1607, and not to that just put\r\nup for the wedding. This was used for the banquet. Foscarini reports\r\n(_V. P._ xii. 532) that:\r\n\r\n   ‘After the ballet was over their Majesties and their Highnesses\r\n   passed into a great Hall especially built for the purpose, where\r\n   were long tables laden with comfits and thousands of mottoes.\r\n   After the King had made the round of the tables, everything was\r\n   in a moment rapaciously swept away.’\r\n\r\nThe records of the Inns throw light on the finance and organization\r\nof the mask. From those of the Inner Temple (Inderwick, ii. 72, 76,\r\n81, 92, 99) we learn that the Inn’s share of the cost was ‘not so\r\nlittle as 1200^{li}’, that there were payments to Lewis Hele, Nicholas\r\nPolhill, and Fenner, and for ‘scarlet for the marshal of the mask’,\r\nthat there was a rehearsal for the benchers at Ely House, and that\r\nfunds were raised up to 1616 by assessments of £2 and £1 and by\r\nassigning the revenue derived from admission fees to chambers. Those\r\nof Gray’s Inn (Fletcher, 201–8) contain an order for such things to\r\nbe bought ‘as M^r. Solicitor [Bacon] shall thinke fitt’. One Will\r\nGerrard was appointed Treasurer, and an assessment of from £1 to £4\r\naccording to status was to be made for a sum equal to that raised by\r\nthe Inner Temple. There was evidently some difficulty in liquidating\r\nthe bills. In May 1613 an order was made ‘that the gent. late actors in\r\nthe maske at the court shall bring in all ther masking apparrel w^{ch}\r\nthey had of the howse charge ... or else the value therof’. In June a\r\nfurther order was drafted and then stayed, calling attention to the\r\n‘sad contempts’ of those affected by the former, ‘albeit none of them\r\ndid contribute anything to the charge’. Each suit had cost 100 marks.\r\nThe offenders were to be discommonsed. In November and again in the\r\nfollowing February it was found necessary to appropriate admission fees\r\ntowards the debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD BERNARD (1568–1641).\r\n\r\nThe translator was born at Epworth, Lincolnshire, took his M.A. from\r\nChrist’s, Cambridge, in 1598, and became incumbent successively of\r\nWorksop, Notts., and Batcombe, Somerset.\r\n\r\n                      _Terence in English > 1598_\r\n\r\n1598.

R._ iv. 87).\r\n\r\nThere are small bits of evidence, in the use of Danish names from\r\n_Hamlet_ and other Elizabethan plays, and in a jest on ‘Mondays vein to\r\npoetize’ (l. 548), to suggest a date of composition long before that of\r\npublication, but a borrowing from _The Knight of the Burning Pestle_\r\nmakes it improbable that this can be earlier than 1607. The amount\r\nof Newcastle local colour and a special mention of ‘those Players of\r\nInterludes that dwels at _Newcastle_’ (l. 534) led Fleay, i. 34, to\r\nconjecture that it was acted in that town.\r\n\r\n                           _Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nAnthony Brewer has been confused with Thomas Brewer, or perhaps with\r\nmore than one writer of that name, who wrote various works of popular\r\nliterature, and to whom yet others bearing only the initials T. B. are\r\ncredited, between 1608 and 1656. Thus _The Country Girl_, printed as\r\nby T. B. in 1647, is ascribed in Kirkman’s play-lists of 1661 and 1671\r\nto Antony Brewer, but in Archer’s list of 1656 to Thomas. Oliphant\r\n(_M. P._ viii. 422) points out that the scene is in part at Edmonton,\r\nand thinks it a revision by Massinger of an early work by Thomas, who\r\npublished a pamphlet entitled _The Life and Death of the Merry Devil of\r\nEdmonton_ in 1608.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR BROOKE (_ob._ 1563).\r\n\r\nIn 1562 he was admitted to the Inner Temple without fee ‘in\r\nconsideration of certain plays and shows at Christmas last set forth by\r\nhim’ (Inderwick, _Inner Temple Records_, i. 219). Possibly he refers\r\nto one of these plays when he says in the epistle to his _Romeus and\r\nJuliet_ (1562), ‘I saw the same argument lately set foorth on stage\r\nwith more commendation then I can looke for: (being there much better\r\nset forth then I have or can dooe)’; but if so, he clearly was not\r\nhimself the author.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL BROOKE (_c._ 1574–1631).\r\n\r\nBrooke was of a York family, and, like his brother Christopher, the\r\npoet, a friend of John Donne, whose marriage he earned a prison by\r\ncelebrating in 1601. He entered Trinity, Cambridge, _c._ 1592, took\r\nhis B.A. in 1595 and his M.A. in 1598. He became chaplain to Prince\r\nHenry, and subsequently Gresham Professor of Divinity and chaplain\r\nsuccessively to James and Charles.

Awaked by a charm, they danced\r\ntheir first and second measures, took out ladies for ‘the old measures,\r\ngalliards, corantoes, the brawls, etc.’, and danced their last measure.\r\n\r\nThe Inner Temple records (Inderwick, ii. 99) mention an order of 21\r\nApril 1616 for recompense to the chief cook on account of damage to\r\nhis room in the cloister when it and its chimney were broken down at\r\nChristmas twelvemonth ‘by such as climbed up at the windows of the hall\r\nto see the mask’.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR GEORGE BUCK (_ob._ 1623).\r\n\r\nHe was Master of the Revels (cf. ch. iii).

Parker (_Parker\r\nCorrespondence_, 218) deprecating the tone of a sermon by Calfhill\r\nbefore the Queen, and said ‘Nunquam in illo loco quisquam minus\r\nsatisfecit, quod maiorem ex eo dolorem omnibus attulit, quoniam admodum\r\nest illis artibus instructus quas illius theatri celebritas postulat’.\r\nNo play by Calfhill is extant, but his Latin tragedy of _Progne_ was\r\ngiven before Elizabeth at Christ Church on 5 Sept. 1566 (cf. ch. iv),\r\nand appears from Bereblock’s synopsis to have been based on an earlier\r\nLatin _Progne_ (1558) by Gregorio Corraro.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CAMPION (1567–1620).\r\n\r\nThomas, son of John Campion, a Chancery clerk of Herts. extraction,\r\nwas born on 12 Feb. 1567, educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he\r\ntook no degree, and admitted on 27 April 1586 to Gray’s Inn, where\r\nhe took part as Hidaspis and Melancholy in the comedy of 16 Jan.\r\n1588 (cf. ch. vii). He left the law, and probably served in Essex’s\r\nexpedition of 1591 to France. He first appeared as a poet, anonymously,\r\nin the appendix to Sidney’s _Astrophel and Stella_ (1591), and has\r\nleft several books of songs written as airs for music, often of\r\nhis own composition, as well as a collection of Latin epigrams and\r\n_Observations in the Art of English Poesie_ (1602). I do not know\r\nwhether he can be the ‘Campnies’ who performed at the Gray’s Inn mask\r\nof Shrovetide 1595 at Court (cf. s.v. _Gesta Grayorum_), but one of the\r\ntwo hymns in that mask, _A Hymn in Praise of Neptune_ is assigned to\r\nhim by Francis Davison, _Poetical Rhapsody_ (1602), sig. K 8, and it is\r\npossible that the second hymn, beginning ‘Shadows before the shining\r\nsun do vanish’, which Davison does not himself appear to claim, may\r\nalso be his. By 1607 he had taken the degree of M.D., probably abroad,\r\nand he practised as a physician. Through Sir Thomas Monson he was\r\nentangled, although in no very blameworthy capacity, in the Somerset\r\nscandals of 1613–15. On 1 March 1620 he died, probably of the plague,\r\nnaming as his legatee Philip Rosseter, with whom he had written _A\r\nBooke of Airs_ in 1601.\r\n\r\nCampion is not traceable as a writer for the stage, although his\r\nconnexion with Monson and Rosseter would have made it not surprising\r\nto find him concerned with the Queen’s Revels syndicate of 1610. But\r\nhis contribution to the _Gesta Grayorum_ foreshadowed his place,\r\nsecond only to Jonson’s, who wrote a _Discourse of Poesie_ (Laing,\r\n1), now lost, against him, in the mask-poetry of the Jacobean period.\r\nIn addition to his acknowledged masks he may also be responsible for\r\npart or all of the Gray’s Inn _Mountebanks Mask_ of 1618, printed by\r\nNichols, _Eliz._ iii. 320, as a second part of the _Gesta Grayorum_,\r\nand by Bullen, _Marston_, iii. 417, although the ascription to Marston\r\nis extremely improbable.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1828.

To this\r\nby occasion other small Poems are adioyned. Inuented and set forth by\r\nThomas Campion Doctor of Phisicke. _John Windet for John Browne._\r\n[Engraving of the maskers’ habit; Verses to James, Lord De Walden and\r\nLord and Lady Hay.]\r\n\r\nThe maskers, in carnation and silver, concealed at first in a ‘false\r\nhabit’ of green leaves and silver, were nine Knights of Apollo; the\r\ntorchbearers the nine Hours of Night; the presenters Flora, Zephyrus,\r\nNight, and Hesperus; the musicians Sylvans, who, as the mask was\r\npredominantly musical, were aided by consorts of instruments and voices\r\nabove the scene and on either side of the hall.\r\n\r\nThe locality was the ‘great hall’ at Whitehall. At the upper end were\r\nthe cloth and chair of state, with ‘scaffolds and seats on either side\r\ncontinued to the screen’. Eighteen feet from the screen was a stage,\r\nwhich stood three feet higher than the ‘dancing-place’ in front of\r\nit, and was enclosed by a ‘double veil’ or vertically divided curtain\r\nrepresenting clouds. The Bower of Flora stood on the right and the\r\nHouse of Night on the left at the ends of the screen, and between them\r\na grove, behind which, under the window, rose hills with a Tree of\r\nDiana. In the grove were nine golden trees which performed the first\r\ndance, and then, at the touch of Night’s wand, were drawn down by an\r\nengine under the stage, and cleft to reveal the maskers. After two\r\nmore ‘new’ dances, they took out the ladies for ‘measures’. Then they\r\ndanced ‘their lighter dances as corantoes, levaltas and galliards’;\r\nthen a fourth ‘new’ dance; and then ‘putting off their vizards and\r\nhelmets, made a low honour to the King, and attended his Majesty to the\r\nbanqueting place’.\r\n\r\nThe mask was given, presumably by friends of the bridegroom, in honour\r\nof the wedding of James Lord Hay and Honora, daughter of Lord Denny.\r\nThe maskers were Lord Walden, Sir Thomas Howard, Sir Henry Carey, Sir\r\nRichard Preston, Sir John Ashley, Sir Thomas Jarret, Sir John Digby,\r\nSir Thomas Badger, and Mr. Goringe. One air for a song and one for a\r\nsong and dance were made by Campion, two for dances by Mr. Lupo, and\r\none for a dance by Mr. Thomas Giles.\r\n\r\nFew contemporary references to the mask exist. It is probably that\r\ndescribed in a letter, which I have not seen, from Lady Pembroke to\r\nLord Shrewsbury, calendared among other _Talbot MSS._ of 1607 in Lodge,\r\nApp. 121. No ambassadors were invited--‘_Dieu merci_’--says the French\r\nambassador, and Anne, declaring herself ill, stayed away (La Boderie,\r\nii. 12, 30). Expenditure on preparing the hall appears in the accounts\r\nof the Treasurer of the Chamber and the Office of Works (Reyher, 520).\r\n\r\n                    _The Lords’ Mask. 14 Feb. 1613_\r\n\r\n1613. _For John Budge._ [Annexed to _Caversham Entertainment_ (q.v.).]\r\n\r\nThis was for the wedding of Elizabeth. The men maskers, in cloth of\r\nsilver, were eight transformed Stars, the women, also in silver,\r\neight transformed Statues; the torchbearers sixteen Fiery Spirits; the\r\nantimaskers six men and six women Frantics; the presenters Orpheus,\r\nMania, Entheus, Prometheus, and Sibylla.\r\n\r\nThe locality was the Banqueting House at Whitehall. The lower part of\r\nthe scene, when discovered, represented a wood, with the thicket of\r\nOrpheus on the right and the cave of Mania on the left. After the ‘mad\r\nmeasure’ of the antimask, the upper part of the scene was discovered\r\n‘by the fall of a curtain’. Here, amidst clouds, were eight Stars which\r\ndanced, vanishing to give place to the eight men maskers in the House\r\nof Prometheus. The torchbearers emerged below, and danced. The maskers\r\ndescended on a cloud, behind which the lower part of the scene was\r\nturned to a façade with four Statues in niches. These and then a second\r\nfour were transformed to women. Then the maskers gave their ‘first new\r\nentering dance’ and their second dance, and took out the bridal pair\r\nand others, ‘men women, and women men’. The scene again changed to a\r\nprospective of porticoes leading to Sibylla’s trophy, an obelisk of\r\nFame. A ‘song and dance triumphant’ followed, and finally the maskers’\r\n‘last new dance’ concluded all ‘at their going out’.\r\n\r\nThis was a mask of lords and ladies, at the cost of the Exchequer.\r\nThe only names on record are those of the Earls of Montgomery and\r\nSalisbury, Lord Hay, and Ann Dudley (_vide infra_). Campion notes\r\nthe ‘extraordinary industry and skill’ of Inigo Jones in ‘the whole\r\ninvention’, and particularly his ‘neat artifice’ in contriving the\r\n‘motion’ of the Stars.\r\n\r\nThe wedding masks were naturally of special interest to the Court\r\ngossips. Chamberlain wrote to Winwood (iii. 421) on 9 Jan.: ‘It is\r\nsaid the Lords and Ladyes about the court have appointed a maske upon\r\ntheir own charge; but I hear there is order given for £1500 to provide\r\none upon the King’s cost, and a £1000 for fireworks. The Inns of Court\r\nare likewise dealt with for two masks against that time, and mean to\r\nfurnish themselves for the service.’ On 29 Jan. he added (iii. 429),\r\n‘Great preparations here are of braverie, masks and fireworks against\r\nthe marriage.’ On 14 Jan. one G. F. Biondi informed Carleton (_S. P.\r\nD. Jac. I_, lxxii. 12) that the Earls of Montgomery and Salisbury and\r\nLord Hay were practising for the wedding mask. On 20 Jan. Sir Charles\r\nMontagu wrote to Sir Edward Montagu (_H. M. C. Buccleugh MSS._ i. 239):\r\n‘Here is not any news stirring, only much preparations at this wedding\r\nfor masks, whereof shall be three, one of eight lords and eight ladies,\r\nwhereof my cousin Ann Dudley one, and two from the Inner Courts, who\r\nthey say will lay it on.’\r\n\r\nThe Lords’ mask is certainly less prominent than those of the Inns of\r\nCourt (_vide sub_ Beaumont and Chapman) in the actual descriptions\r\nof the wedding. All three are recorded in Stowe, _Annales_, 916, in\r\n_Wilbraham’s Journal_ (_Camden Misc._ x), 110, in reports of the\r\nVenetian ambassador (_V. P._ xii. 499, 532), and in the contemporary\r\nprinted accounts of the whole ceremonies (cf. ch. xxiv). These do not\r\nadd much to the printed descriptions of the mask-writers, on which,\r\nindeed, they are largely based. The fullest unofficial account was\r\ngiven by Chamberlain to Alice and Dudley Carleton in three letters\r\n(Birch, i. 224, 229; _S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxxii. 30, 31, 48). On 18 Feb.\r\nhe wrote: ‘That night [of the wedding] was the Lords’ mask, whereof I\r\nhear no great commendation, save only for riches, their devices being\r\nlong and tedious, and more like a play than a mask.’ This criticism he\r\nrepeated in a letter to Winwood (iii. 435). To Alice Carleton he added,\r\nafter describing the bravery of the Inns of Court: ‘All this time\r\nthere was a course taken, and so notified, that no lady or gentlewoman\r\nshould be admitted to any of these sights with a vardingale, which was\r\nto gain the more room, and I hope may serve to make them quite left\r\noff in time. And yet there were more scaffolds, and more provision\r\nmade for room than ever I saw, both in the hall and banqueting room,\r\nbesides a new room built to dine and dance in.’ On 25 February, when\r\nall was over, he reported: ‘Our revels and triumphs within doors\r\ngave great contentment, being both dainty and curious in devices and\r\nsumptuous in show, specially the inns of court, whose two masks stood\r\nthem in better than £4000, besides the gallantry and expense of private\r\ngentlemen that were but _ante ambul[at]ores_ and went only to accompany\r\nthem.... The next night [21 Feb.] the King invited the maskers, with\r\ntheir assistants, to the number of forty, to a solemn supper in the\r\nnew marriage room, where they were well treated and much graced\r\nwith kissing her majesty’s hand, and every one having a particular\r\n_accoglienza_ from him. The King husbanded this matter so well that\r\nthis feast was not at his own cost, but he and his company won it upon\r\na wager of running at the ring, of the prince and his nine followers,\r\nwho paid £30 a man. The King, queen, prince, Palatine and Lady\r\nElizabeth sat at table by themselves, and the great lords and ladies,\r\nwith the maskers, above four score in all, sat at another long table,\r\nso that there was no room for them that made the feast, but they were\r\nfain to be lookers on, which the young Lady Rich took no great pleasure\r\nin, to see her husband, who was one that paid, not so much as drink for\r\nhis money. The ambassadors that were at this wedding and shows were the\r\nFrench, Venetian, Count Henry [of Nassau] and Caron for the States.\r\nThe Spaniard was or would be sick, and the archduke’s ambassador being\r\ninvited for the second day, made a sullen excuse; and those that were\r\npresent were not altogether so well pleased but that I hear every one\r\nhad some punctilio of disgust.’ John Finett, in a letter of 22 Feb. to\r\nCarleton (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxxii. 32), says the mask of the Lords\r\nwas ‘rich and ingenious’ and those of the Inns ‘much commended’. His\r\nletter is largely taken up with the ambassadorial troubles to which\r\nChamberlain refers. Later he dealt with these in _Philoxenis_ (1656),\r\n1 (cf. Sullivan, 79). The chief marfeast was the archiducal ambassador\r\nBoiscot, who resented an invitation to the second or third day, while\r\nin the diplomatic absence through sickness of the Spaniard the Venetian\r\nambassador was asked with the French for the first day. Finett was\r\ncharged with various plausible explanations. James did not think it\r\nhis business to decide questions of precedence. It was customary to\r\ngroup Venice and France. The Venetian had brought an extraordinary\r\nmessage of congratulation from his State, and had put his retinue into\r\nroyal liveries at great expense. The wedding was a continuing feast,\r\nand all its days equally glorious. In fact, whether at Christmas or\r\nShrovetide, the last day was in some ways the most honourable, and it\r\nhad originally been planned to have the Lords’ mask on Shrove-Tuesday.\r\nBut Boiscot could not be persuaded to accept his invitation. The\r\nambassadors who did attend were troublesome, at supper, rather than at\r\nthe mask. The French ambassador ‘made an offer to precede the prince’.\r\nHis wife nearly left because she was placed below, instead of above,\r\nthe Viscountesses. The Venetian claimed a chair instead of a stool,\r\nand a place above the carver, but in vain. His rebuff did not prevent\r\nhim from speaking well of the Lords’ mask, which he called ‘very\r\nbeautiful’, specially noting the three changes of scene.\r\n\r\nSeveral financial documents relating to the mask are preserved (Reyher,\r\n508, 522; Devon, 158, 164; Collier, i. 364; Hazlitt, _E. D. S._ 43;\r\n_Archaeologia_, xxvi. 380). In _Abstract_ 14 the charges are given as\r\n£400, but the total charges must have been much higher. Chamberlain\r\n(_vide supra_) spoke of £1,500 as assigned to them. A list of personal\r\nfees, paid through Meredith Morgan, alone (Reyher, 509) amounts to £411\r\n6_s._ 8_d._ Campion had £66 13_s._ 4_d._, Jones £50, the dancers Jerome\r\nHerne, Bochan, Thomas Giles and Confess £30 or £40 each, the musicians\r\nJohn Cooper, Robert Johnson, and Thomas Lupo £10 or £20 each. One\r\nSteven Thomas had £15, ‘he that played to y^e boyes’ £6 13_s._ 4_d._,\r\nand ‘2 that played to y^e Antick Maske’ £11; while fees of £1 each went\r\nto 42 musicians, 12 mad folks, 5 speakers, 10 of the King’s violins and\r\n3 grooms of the chamber. The supervision of ‘emptions and provisions’\r\nwas entrusted to the Lord Chamberlain and the Master of the Horse.\r\n\r\n            _The Caversham Entertainment. 27–8 April 1613_\r\n\r\n1613.

Whereunto\r\nis annexed the Description, Speeches and Songs of the Lords Maske,\r\npresented in the Banquetting-house on the Marriage night of the High\r\nand Mightie, Count Palatine, and the Royally descended the Ladie\r\nElizabeth. Written by Thomas Campion. _For John Budge._\r\n\r\nOn arrival were speeches, a song, and a dance by a Cynic, a Traveller,\r\ntwo Keepers, and two Robin Hood men at the park gate; then speeches in\r\nthe lower garden by a Gardener, and a song by his man and boy; then a\r\nconcealed song in the upper garden.\r\n\r\nAfter supper was a mask in the hall by eight ‘noble and princely\r\npersonages’ in green with vizards, accompanied by eight pages as\r\ntorchbearers, and presented by the Cynic, Traveller, Gardener, and\r\ntheir ‘crew’, and Sylvanus. The maskers gave a ‘new dance’; then took\r\nout the ladies, among whom Anne ‘vouchsafed to make herself the head\r\nof their revels, and graciously to adorn the place with her personal\r\ndancing’; ‘much of the night being thus spent with variety of dances,\r\nthe masquers made a conclusion with a second new dance’.\r\n\r\nOn departure were a speech and song by the Gardeners, and presents of a\r\nbag of linen, apron, and mantle by three country maids.\r\n\r\nChamberlain wrote of this entertainment to Winwood (iii. 454) on 6 May,\r\n‘The King brought her on her way to Hampton Court; her next move was\r\nto Windsor, then to Causham, a house of the Lord Knolles not far from\r\nReading, where she was entertained with Revells, and a gallant mask\r\nperformed by the Lord Chamberlain’s four sons, the Earl of Dorset, the\r\nLord North, Sir Henry Rich, and Sir Henry Carie, and at her parting\r\npresented with a dainty coverled or quilt, a rich carrquenet, and a\r\ncurious cabinet, to the value in all of 1500^l.’ He seems to have sent\r\na similar account in an unprinted letter of 29 April to Carleton (_S.\r\nP. D. Jac. I_, lxxii. 120). The four sons of Lord Chamberlain Suffolk\r\nwho appear in other masks are Theophilus Lord Walden, Sir Thomas, Sir\r\nHenry, and Sir Charles Howard.\r\n\r\n            _Lord Somerset’s Mask [Squires]. 26 Dec. 1613_\r\n\r\n1614. The Description of a Maske: Presented in the Banqueting roome at\r\nWhitehall, on Saint Stephens night last, At the Mariage of the Right\r\nHonourable the Earle of Somerset: And the right noble the Lady Frances\r\nHoward. Written by Thomas Campion. Whereunto are annexed diuers choyse\r\nAyres composed for this Maske that may be sung with a single voyce to\r\nthe Lute or Base-Viall. _E. A. for Laurence Lisle._\r\n\r\nThe maskers were twelve Disenchanted Knights; the first antimaskers\r\nfour Enchanters and Enchantresses, four Winds, four Elements, and four\r\nParts of the Earth; the second antimaskers twelve Skippers in red and\r\nwhite; the presenters four Squires and three Destinies; the musicians\r\nEternity, Harmony, and a chorus of nine.\r\n\r\nThe locality was the banqueting room at Whitehall, of which the upper\r\npart, ‘where the state is placed’, and the sides were ‘theatred’ with\r\npillars and scaffolds. At the lower end was a triumphal arch, ‘which\r\nenclosed the whole works’ and behind it the scene, from which a curtain\r\nwas drawn. Above was a clouded sky; beneath a sea bounded by two\r\npromontories bearing pillars of gold, and in front ‘a pair of stairs\r\nmade exceeding curiously in form of a scallop shell’, between two\r\ngardens with seats for the maskers. After the first antimask, danced\r\n‘in a strange kind of confusion’, the Destinies brought the Queen a\r\ngolden tree, whence she plucked a bough to disenchant the Knights,\r\nwho then appeared, six from a cloud, six from the golden pillars.\r\nThe scene changed, and ‘London with the Thames is very artificially\r\npresented’. The maskers gave the first and second dance, and then\r\ndanced with the ladies, ‘wherein spending as much time as they held\r\nfitting, they returned to the seats provided for them’. Barges then\r\nbrought the second antimask. After the maskers’ last dance, the Squires\r\ncomplimented the royalties and bridal pair.\r\n\r\nThis was a wedding mask, by lords and gentlemen. The maskers were\r\nthe Duke of Lennox, the Earls of Pembroke, Dorset, Salisbury, and\r\nMontgomery, the Lords Walden, Scroope, North, and Hay, Sir Thomas, Sir\r\nHenry, and Sir Charles Howard. The ‘workmanship’ was undertaken by ‘M.\r\nConstantine’ [Servi], ‘but he being too much of himself, and no way to\r\nbe drawn to impart his intentions, failed so far in the assurance he\r\ngave that the main invention, even at the last cast, was of force drawn\r\ninto a far narrower compass than was from the beginning intended’. One\r\nsong was by Nicholas Lanier; three were by [Giovanni] Coprario and\r\nwere sung by John Allen and Lanier. G. F. Biondi informed Carleton\r\non 24 Nov. (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxxv. 25) of the ‘costly ballets’\r\npreparing for Somerset’s wedding. On 25 Nov. Chamberlain wrote to\r\nCarleton (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxxv. 28; Birch, i. 278): ‘All the talk\r\nis now of masking and feasting at these towardly marriages, whereof\r\nthe one is appointed on St. Stephen’s day, in Christmas, the other for\r\nTwelfthtide. The King bears the charge of the first, all saving the\r\napparel, and no doubt the queen will do as much on her side, which must\r\nbe a mask of maids, if they may be found.... The maskers, besides the\r\nlord chamberlain’s four sons, are named to be the Earls of Rutland,\r\nPembroke, Montgomery, Dorset, Salisbury, the Lords Chandos, North,\r\nCompton, and Hay; Edward Sackville, that killed the Lord Bruce, was in\r\nthe list, but was put out again; and I marvel he would offer himself,\r\nknowing how little gracious he is, and that he hath been assaulted once\r\nor twice since his return.’ The Queen’s entertainment, which did not\r\nprove to be a mask, was Daniel’s _Hymen’s Triumph_. The actual list of\r\nperformers in the mask of 26 Dec. was somewhat differently made up. On\r\n18 Nov. Lord Suffolk had sent invitations through Sir Thomas Lake to\r\nthe Earl of Rutland and Lord Willoughby d’Eresby (_S. P. D. Jac. I_,\r\nlxxv. 15; Reyher, 505), but apparently neither accepted. He also wrote\r\nto Lake on 8 Dec. (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxxv. 37) hoping that Sackville\r\nmight be allowed to take part, not in the mask, but in the tilt (as\r\nin fact he did), at his cousin’s wedding. On 30 Dec. Chamberlain sent\r\nAlice Carleton an accurate list of the actual maskers (_S. P. D. Jac.\r\nI_, lxxv. 53; Birch, i. 285), with the comment, ‘I hear little or no\r\ncommendation of the mask made by the lords that night, either for\r\ndevice or dancing, only it was rich and costly’. The ‘great bravery’\r\nand masks at the wedding are briefly recorded by Gawdy, 175, and a\r\nlist of the festivities is given by Howes in Stowe, _Annales_ (1615),\r\n928. He records five in all: ‘A gallant maske of Lords’ [Campion’s] on\r\n26 Dec., the wedding night, ‘a maske of the princes gentlemen’ on 29\r\nDec. and 3 Jan. [Jonson’s _Irish Mask_], ‘2 seuerall pleasant maskes’\r\nat Merchant Taylors on 4 Jan. [including Middleton’s lost _Mask of\r\nCupid_], and a Gray’s Inn mask on 6 Jan. [_Flowers_].\r\n\r\nThe ambassadorial complications of the year are described by Finett,\r\n12 (cf. Sullivan, 84). Spain had been in the background at the\r\nroyal wedding of the previous year, and as there was a new Spanish\r\nambassador (Sarmiento) this was made an excuse for asking him with\r\nthe archiducal ambassador on 26 Dec. and the French and Venetian\r\nambassadors on 6 Jan. By way of compensation these were also asked to\r\nthe Roxburghe-Drummond wedding on 2 Feb. They received purely formal\r\ninvitations to the Somerset wedding, and returned excuses for staying\r\naway. The agents of Florence and Savoy were asked, and when they raised\r\nthe question of precedence were told that they were not ambassadors and\r\nmight scramble for places.\r\n\r\nI am not quite clear whether the costs of this mask, as well as of\r\nJonson’s _Irish Mask_, fell on the Exchequer. Chamberlain’s notice of\r\n25 Nov. (_vide supra_) is not conclusive. Reyher, 523, assigns most\r\nof the financial documents to the _Irish Mask_, but an account of the\r\nWorks for an arch and pilasters to the Lords’ mask; and the payment to\r\nMeredith Morgan in Sept. 1614 (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxxvii. 92), which he\r\ndoes not cite, appears from the Calendar to be for more than one mask.\r\nThe _Irish Mask_ needed no costly scenery.\r\n\r\nJ[ohn] B[ruce], (_Camden Misc._ v), describes a late eighteenth or\r\nearly nineteenth century forgery, of unknown origin, purporting to\r\ndescribe one of the masks at the Somerset wedding and other events. The\r\ndetails used belong partly to 1613–14 and partly to 1614–15.\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH, LADY CARY (1586–1639).\r\n\r\n                         _Mariam. 1602 < > 5._\r\n\r\nI have omitted a notice of this closet play, printed in 1613, by a\r\nslip, and can only add to the edition (_M. S. C._) of 1914 that Lady\r\nCary was married in 1602 (Chamberlain, 199), not 1600. She wrote an\r\nearlier play on a Syracusan theme.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ROBERT CECIL, EARL OF SALISBURY (1563–1612).\r\n\r\nBut few details of the numerous royal entertainments given by Sir\r\nWilliam Cecil, Lord Burghley, and his sons Sir Thomas Cecil, Lord\r\nBurghley and afterwards Earl of Exeter, and Sir Robert Cecil, Earl of\r\nSalisbury, are upon record. It is, on the whole, convenient to note\r\nhere, rather than in ch. xxiv, those which have a literary element.\r\nRobert Cecil contributed to that of 1594, and possibly to others.\r\n\r\n     i. _Theobalds Entertainment of 1571 (William Lord Burghley)._\r\n\r\nElizabeth was presented with verses and a picture of the newly-finished\r\nhouse on 21 Sept. 1571 (Haynes-Murdin, ii. 772).\r\n\r\n    ii. _Theobalds Entertainment of 1591 (William Lord Burghley)._\r\n\r\nElizabeth came for 10–20 May 1591, and knighted Robert Cecil.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Strype, _Annals_, iv. 108, and Nichols, _Eliz._ iii. 75, print\r\na mock charter, dated 10 May 1591, and addressed by Lord Chancellor\r\nHatton, in the Queen’s name, ‘To the disconsolate and retired spryte,\r\nthe Heremite of Tybole’, in which he is called upon to return to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Collier, i. 276, followed by Bullen, _Peele_, ii. 305, prints\r\nfrom a MS. in the collection of Frederic Ouvry a Hermit’s speech,\r\nsubscribed with the initials G. P. and said by Collier to be in Peele’s\r\nhand. This is a petition to the Queen for a writ to cause the founder\r\nof the hermit’s cell to restore it. This founder has himself occupied\r\nit for two years and a few months since the death of his wife, and has\r\nobliged the hermit to govern his house. Numerous personal allusions\r\nmake it clear that the ‘founder’ is Burghley, and as Lady Burghley died\r\n4 April 1589, the date should be in 1591.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Bullen, _Peele_, ii. 309, following Dyce, prints two speeches by\r\na Gardener and a Mole Catcher, communicated by Collier to Dyce from\r\nanother MS. The ascription to Peele is conjectural, and R. W. Bond,\r\n_Lyly_, i. 417, claims them, also by conjecture, for Lyly. However this\r\nmay be, they are addressed to the Queen, who has reigned thirty-three\r\nyears, and introduce the gift of a jewel in a box. Elizabeth had not\r\nreigned full thirty-three years in May 1591, but perhaps near enough.\r\nThat Theobalds was the locality is indicated by a reference to Pymms\r\nat Edmonton, a Cecil property 6 miles from Theobalds, as occupied\r\nby ‘the youngest son of this honourable old man’. One is bound to\r\nmistrust manuscripts communicated by Collier, but there is evidence\r\nthat Burghley retired to ‘Colling’s Lodge’ near Theobalds in grief at\r\nhis wife’s death in 1589, and also that in 1591, when he failed to\r\nestablish Robert Cecil as Secretary, he made a diplomatic pretence of\r\ngiving up public life (Hume, _The Great Lord Burghley_, 439, 446).\r\n\r\n    iii. _Theobalds Entertainment of 1594 (William Lord Burghley)_.\r\n\r\nThe Hermit was brought into play again when Elizabeth next visited\r\nTheobalds, in 1594 (13–23 June). He delivered an Oration, in which he\r\nrecalled the recovery of his cell at her last coming, and expressed\r\na fear that ‘my young master’ might wish to use it. No doubt the\r\nalternative was that Robert Cecil should become Secretary. The oration,\r\n‘penned by Sir Robert Cecill’, is printed by Nichols, _Eliz._ iii. 241,\r\nfrom _Bodl. Rawlinson MS. D_ 692 (_Bodl._ 13464), f. 106.\r\n\r\n     iv. _Wimbledon Entertainment of 1599 (Thomas Lord Burghley)_.\r\n\r\nA visit of 27–30 July 1599 is the probable occasion for an address of\r\nwelcome, not mimetic in character, by a porter, John Joye, preserved in\r\n_Bodl. Tanner MS._ 306, f. 266, and endorsed ‘The queenes entertainment\r\natt Wimbledon 99’.\r\n\r\n      v. _Cecil House Entertainment of 1602 (Sir Robert Cecil)._\r\n\r\nElizabeth dined with Cecil on 6 Dec. 1602.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Manningham, 99, records, ‘Sundry devises; at hir entraunce,\r\nthree women, a maid, a widdowe, and a wife, each commending their owne\r\nstates, but the Virgin preferred; an other, on attired in habit of a\r\nTurke desyrous to see hir Majestie, but as a straunger without hope of\r\nsuch grace, in regard of the retired manner of hir Lord, complained;\r\nanswere made, howe gracious hir Majestie in admitting to presence, and\r\nhowe able to discourse in anie language; whiche the Turke admired,\r\nand, admitted, presents hir with a riche mantle.’ Chamberlain, 169,\r\nadds, ‘You like the Lord Kepers devises so ill, that I cared not to get\r\nMr. Secretaries that were not much better, saving a pretty dialogue\r\nof John Davies ’twixt a Maide, a widow, and a wife.’ _A Contention\r\nBetwixt a Wife, a Widdow, and a Maide_ was registered on 2 Apr. 1604\r\n(Arber iii. 258), appeared with the initials I. D. in Francis Davison’s\r\n_Poetical Rhapsody_ (ed. 2, 1608) and is reprinted by Grosart in the\r\n_Poems_ of Sir John Davies (q.v.) from the ed. of 1621, where it is\r\nascribed to ‘Sir I. D.’.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Nichols, _Eliz._ iii. 76, prints from _Harl. MS._ 286, f. 248,\r\n‘A Conference betweene a Gent. Huisher and a Poet, before the Queene,\r\nat M^r. Secretaryes House. By John Davies.’ He assigns it to 1591, but\r\nCecil was not then Secretary, and it probably belongs to 1602.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Hatfield MSS_. xii. 568 has verses endorsed ‘1602’ and beginning\r\n‘Now we have present made, To Cynthya, Phebe, Flora’.\r\n\r\n      vi. _Theobalds Entertainment of 1606 (Earl of Salisbury)._\r\n\r\nSee s.v. Jonson; also the mask described by Harington (ch. v).\r\n\r\n      vii. _Theobalds Entertainment of 1607 (Earl of Salisbury)._\r\n\r\nSee s.v. Jonson.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE CHAPMAN (_c._ 1560–1634).\r\n\r\nChapman was born in 1559 or 1560 near Hitchin in Hertfordshire.\r\nAnthony Wood believed him to have been at Oxford, and possibly also at\r\nCambridge, but neither residence can be verified. It is conjectured\r\nthat residence at Hitchin and soldiering in the Low Countries may have\r\nhelped to fill the long period before his first appearance as a writer,\r\nunless indeed the isolated translation _Fedele and Fortunio_ (1584)\r\nis his, with _The Shadow of Night_ (1594). This shows him a member of\r\nthe philosophical circle of which the centre was Thomas Harriot. The\r\nsuggestion of W. Minto that he was the ‘rival poet’ of Shakespeare’s\r\n_Sonnets_ is elaborated by Acheson, who believes that Shakespeare drew\r\nhim as Holophernes and as Thersites, and accepted by Robertson; it\r\nwould be more plausible if any relation between the Earl of Southampton\r\nand Chapman, earlier than a stray dedication shared with many others\r\nin 1609, could be established. By 1596, and possibly earlier, Chapman\r\nwas in Henslowe’s pay as a writer for the Admiral’s. His plays,\r\nwhich proved popular, included, besides the extant _Blind Beggar of\r\nAlexandria_ and _Humorous Day’s Mirth_, five others, of which some and\r\nperhaps all have vanished. These were _The Isle of a Woman_, afterwards\r\ncalled _The Fount of New Fashions_ (May–Oct. 1598), _The World Runs\r\non Wheels_, afterwards called _All Fools but the Fool_ (Jan.–July\r\n1599), _Four Kings_ (Oct. 1598–Jan. 1599), a ‘tragedy of Bengemens\r\nplotte’ (Oct.–Jan. 1598; cf. s.v. Jonson) and a pastoral tragedy (July\r\n1599). His reputation both for tragedy and for comedy was established\r\nwhen Meres wrote his _Palladis Tamia_ in 1598. During 1599 Chapman\r\ndisappears from Henslowe’s diary, and in 1600 or soon after began his\r\nseries of plays for the Chapel, afterwards Queen’s Revels, children.\r\nThis lasted until 1608, when his first indiscretion of _Eastward Ho!_\r\n(1605), in reply to which he was caricatured as Bellamont in Dekker\r\nand Webster’s _Northward Ho!_, was followed by a second in _Byron_.\r\nHe now probably dropped his connexion with the stage, at any rate for\r\nmany years. After completing Marlowe’s _Hero and Leander_ in 1598, he\r\nhad begun his series of Homeric translations, and these Prince Henry,\r\nto whom he had been appointed sewer in ordinary at the beginning of\r\nJames’s reign, now bade him pursue, with the promise of £300, to which\r\non his death-bed in 1612 he added another of a life-pension. These\r\nJames failed to redeem, and Chapman also lost his place as sewer. His\r\ncorrespondence contains complaints of poverty, probably of this or a\r\nlater date, and indications of an attempt, with funds supplied by a\r\nbrother, to mend his fortunes by marriage with a widow. He found a new\r\npatron in the Earl of Somerset, wrote one of the masks for the wedding\r\nof the Princess Elizabeth in 1613, and went on with Homer, completing\r\nhis task in 1624. He lived until 12 May 1634, and his tomb by Inigo\r\nJones still stands at St. Giles-in-the-Fields. In his later years he\r\nseems to have touched up some of his dramatic work and possibly to have\r\nlent a hand to the younger dramatist Shirley. Jonson told Drummond in\r\n1619 that ‘next himself, only Fletcher and Chapman could make a mask’,\r\nand that ‘Chapman and Fletcher were loved of him’ (Laing, 4, 12), and\r\nsome of Jonson’s extant letters appear to confirm the kindly relations\r\nwhich these phrases suggest. But a fragment of invective against Jonson\r\nleft by Chapman on his death-bed suggests that they did not endure for\r\never.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1873. [R. H.

Savage,\r\n_Stratford upon Avon Notebooks_, i. 7 (1888) to be from an unknown play\r\nof Shakespeare, appear with slight variants in the 1598 text. This,\r\nwhich is very short, probably represents a ‘cut’ stage copy. Pudsey is\r\ntraceable as an actor (cf. ch. xv) in 1626.\r\n\r\n                    _An Humorous Day’s Mirth. 1597_\r\n\r\n1599.

It is doubtless also the play\r\nof which John Chamberlain wrote to Dudley Carleton (Chamberlain, 4) on\r\n11 June 1597, ‘We have here a new play of humors in very great request,\r\nand I was drawne along to it by the common applause, but my opinion of\r\nit is (as the fellow saide of the shearing of hogges), that there was a\r\ngreat crie for so litle wolle.’\r\n\r\n                    _The Gentleman Usher. 1602_ (?)\r\n\r\n[_MS._] For an unverified MS. cf. s.v. _Monsieur D’Olive._\r\n\r\n_S.

It was later than _Sir Giles Goosecap_ (q.v.), to\r\nthe title-rôle of which II. i. 81 alludes, but of this also the date\r\nis uncertain. Parrott’s ‘1602’ is plausible enough, but 1604 is also\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n                         _All Fools. 1604_ (?)\r\n\r\n1605.

Stier,\r\n_C.’s All Fools mit Berücksichtigung seiner Quellen_ (1904, _Halle\r\ndiss._).\r\n\r\nThe Court performance was on 1 Jan. 1605 (cf. App. B), and the play\r\nwas therefore probably on the Blackfriars stage in 1604. There is a\r\nreminiscence of Ophelia’s flowers in II. i. 232, and the prologue seems\r\nto criticize the _Poetomachia_.\r\n\r\n    Who can show cause why th’ ancient comic vein\r\n    Of Eupolis and Cratinus (now reviv’d\r\n    Subject to personal application)\r\n    Should be exploded by some bitter spleens.\r\n\r\nBut in Jan.–July 1599 Henslowe paid Chapman £8 10_s._ on behalf of\r\nthe Admiral’s for _The World Runs on Wheels_. The last entry is for\r\n‘his boocke called the world Rones a whelles & now all foolles but the\r\nfoolle’. This seems to me, more clearly than to Greg (_Henslowe_, ii.\r\n203), to indicate a single play and a changed title. I am less certain,\r\nhowever, that he is right in adopting the view of Fleay, i. 59, that\r\nit was an earlier version of the Blackfriars play. It may be so, and\r\nthe date of ‘the seventeenth of November, fifteen hundred and so forth’\r\nused for a deed in IV. i. 331 lends some confirmation. But the change\r\nof company raises a doubt, and there is no ‘fool’ in _All Fools_. An\r\nalternative conjecture is that the Admiral’s reverted to the original\r\ntitle for their play, leaving a modification of the amended one\r\navailable for Chapman in 1604. Collier (Dodsley^3) printed a dedicatory\r\nsonnet to Sir Thomas Walsingham. This exists only in a single copy, in\r\nwhich it has been printed on an inserted leaf. T. J. Wise (_Ath._ 1908,\r\ni. 788) and Parrott, ii. 726, show clearly that it is a forgery.\r\n\r\n                       _Monsieur D’Olive. 1604_\r\n\r\n[_MS._] See _infra_.\r\n\r\n1606.

Dilke (1814, _O. E. P._ iii).\r\n\r\nThe title-page suggests a Revels rather than a Chapel play, and Fleay,\r\ni. 59, Stoll, and Parrott all arrive at 1604 for the date, which is\r\nrendered probable by allusions to the Jacobean knights (I. i. 263;\r\nIV. ii. 77), to the calling in of monopolies (I. i. 284), to the\r\npreparation of costly embassies (IV. ii. 114), and perhaps to the royal\r\ndislike of tobacco (II. ii. 164). There is a reminiscence of _Hamlet_,\r\nIII. ii. 393, in II. ii. 91:\r\n\r\n                                  our great men\r\n    Like to a mass of clouds that now seem like\r\n    An elephant, and straightways like an ox,\r\n    And then a mouse.\r\n\r\nOn the inadequate ground that woman’s ‘will’ is mentioned in II. i.\r\n89, Fleay regarded the play as a revision of one written by Chapman\r\nfor the Admiral’s in 1598 under the title of _The Will of a Woman_.\r\nBut Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 194) interprets Henslowe’s entry ‘the iylle\r\nof a woman’ as _The Isle of Women_. The 1598 play seems to have been\r\nrenamed _The Fount of New Fashions_. Hazlitt, _Manual_, 89, 94, says\r\npart Heber’s sale included MSS. both of _The Fount of New Fashions_,\r\nand of _The Gentleman Usher_ under the title of _The Will of a Woman_,\r\nbut Greg could not find these in the sale catalogue.\r\n\r\n                        _Bussy D’Ambois. 1604_\r\n\r\n_S.

R._ iii. 126).\r\n\r\nThe play was acted by Paul’s, who disappear in 1606. It has been\r\nsuggested that it dates in some form from 1598 or earlier, because Pero\r\nis a female character, and an Admiral’s inventory of 1598 (_Henslowe\r\nPapers_, 120) has ‘Perowes sewt, which W^m Sley were’. As Sly had\r\nbeen a Chamberlain’s man since 1594, this must have been a relic of\r\nsome obsolete play. But the impossible theory seems to have left a\r\ntrace on the suggestion of Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 198) that Chapman may\r\nhave worked on the basis of the series of plays on _The Civil Wars\r\nof France_ written by Dekker (q.v.) and others for the Admiral’s at\r\na later date in 1598 than that of the inventories. From one of these\r\nplays, however, might come the reminiscence of a ‘trusty Damboys’\r\nin _Satiromastix_ (1601), IV. i. 174. For _Bussy_ itself a jest on\r\n‘leap-year’ (I. ii. 82) points to either 1600 or 1604, and allusions\r\nto Elizabeth as an ‘old queen’ (I. ii. 12), to a ‘knight of the new\r\nedition’ (I. ii. 124), with which may be compared Day, _Isle of Gulls_\r\n(1606), i. 3, ‘gentlemen ... of the best and last edition, of the Dukes\r\nown making’, and to a ‘new denizened lord’ (I. ii. 173) point to 1604\r\nrather than 1600. The play was revived by the King’s men and played at\r\nCourt on 7 April 1634 (_Variorum_, iii. 237), and to this date probably\r\nbelongs the prologue in the edition of 1641. Here the actors declare\r\nthat the piece, which evidently others had ventured to play, was\r\n\r\n                              known,\r\n    And still believed in Court to be our own.\r\n\r\nThey add that\r\n\r\n                        Field is gone,\r\n    Whose action first did give it name,\r\n\r\nand that his successor (perhaps Taylor) is prevented by his grey beard\r\nfrom taking the young hero, which therefore falls to a ‘third man’ who\r\nhas been liked as Richard. Gayton, _Festivous Notes on Don Quixote_\r\n(1654), 25, tells us that Eliard Swanston played Bussy; doubtless\r\nhe is the third man. The revision of the text, incorporated in the\r\n1641 edition, may obviously date either from this or for some earlier\r\nrevival. It is not necessary to assume that the performances by Field\r\nreferred to in the prologue were earlier than 1616, when he joined the\r\nKing’s. Parrott, however, makes it plausible that they might have been\r\nfor the Queen’s Revels at Whitefriars in 1609–12, about the time when\r\nthe _Revenge_ was played by the same company. If so, the Revels must\r\nhave acquired _Bussy_ after the Paul’s performances ended in 1606. It\r\nis, of course, quite possible that they were only recovering a play\r\noriginally written for them, and carried by Kirkham to Paul’s in 1605.\r\n\r\n                          _Eastward Ho! 1605_\r\n\r\nWith Jonson and Marston.\r\n\r\n_S.

P._ v. 105).\r\n\r\nJonson told Drummond in 1619 (Laing, 20): ‘He was dilated by Sir James\r\nMurray to the King, for writing something against the Scots, in a\r\nplay Eastward Hoe, and voluntarly imprissoned himself with Chapman\r\nand Marston, who had written it amongst them. The report was, that\r\nthey should then [have] had their ears cut and noses. After their\r\ndelivery, he banqueted all his friends; there was Camden, Selden, and\r\nothers; at the midst of the feast his old Mother dranke to him, and\r\nshew him a paper which she had (if the sentence had taken execution) to\r\nhave mixed in the prisson among his drinke, which was full of lustie\r\nstrong poison, and that she was no churle, she told, she minded first\r\nto have drunk of it herself.’ The _Hatfield MSS._ contain a letter\r\n(i) from Jonson (Cunningham, _Jonson_, i. xlix), endorsed ‘1605’, to\r\nthe Earl of Salisbury, created 4 May 1605. Another copy is in the\r\nMS. described by B. Dobell, with ten other letters, of which Dobell,\r\nfollowed by Schelling, prints three by Jonson, (ii) to an unnamed\r\nlord, probably Suffolk, (iii) to an unnamed earl, (iv) to an unnamed\r\n‘excellentest of Ladies’, and three by Chapman, (v) to the King, (vi)\r\nto Lord Chamberlain Suffolk, (vii) to an unnamed lord, probably also\r\nSuffolk. These, with four others by Chapman not printed, have no dates,\r\nbut all, with (i), seem to refer to the same joint imprisonment of\r\nthe two poets. In (i) Jonson says that he and Chapman are in prison\r\n‘unexamined and unheard’. The cause is a play of which ‘no man can\r\njustly complain’, for since his ‘first error’ and its ‘bondage’ [1597]\r\nJonson has ‘attempered my style’ and his books have never ‘given\r\noffence to a nation, to a public order or state, or to any person of\r\nhonour or authority’. The other letters add a few facts. In (v) Chapman\r\nsays that the ‘chief offences are but two clawses, and both of them\r\nnot our owne’; in (vi) that ‘our unhappie booke was presented without\r\nyour Lordshippes allowance’; and in (vii) that they are grateful\r\nfor an expected pardon of which they have heard from Lord Aubigny.\r\nCastelain, _Jonson_, 901, doubts whether this correspondence refers\r\nto _Eastward Ho!_, chiefly because there is no mention of Marston,\r\nand after hesitating over _Sejanus_, suggests _Sir Giles Goosecap_\r\n(q.v.), which is not worth consideration. Jonson was in trouble for\r\n_Sejanus_ (q.v.), but on grounds not touched on in these letters, and\r\nChapman was not concerned. I feel no doubt that the imprisonment was\r\nthat for _Eastward Ho!_ Probably Drummond was wrong about Marston, who\r\nescaped. His ‘absence’ is noted in the t.p. of Q_{2} of _The Fawn_\r\n(1606), and chaffed by A. Nixon, _The Black Year_ (1606): ‘Others ...\r\narraign other mens works ... when their own are sacrificed in Paul’s\r\nChurchyard, for bringing in the Dutch Courtesan to corrupt English\r\nconditions and sent away westward for carping both at court, city, and\r\ncountry.’ Evidently Jonson and Chapman, justly or not, put the blame\r\nof the obnoxious clauses upon him, and renewed acrimony against Jonson\r\nmay be traced in his Epistles of 1606. I am inclined to think that it\r\nwas the publication of the play in the autumn of 1605, rather than its\r\npresentation on the stage, that brought the poets into trouble. This\r\nwould account for the suppression of a passage reflecting upon the\r\nScots (III. iii. 40–7) which appeared in the first issue of Q_{1} (cf.\r\nParrott, ii. 862). Other quips at the intruding nation, at James’s\r\nliberal knightings, and even at his northern accent (I. ii. 50, 98; II.\r\niii. 83; IV. i. 179) appear to have escaped censure. Nor was the play\r\nas a whole banned. It passed to the Lady Elizabeth’s, who revived it in\r\n1613 (_Henslowe Papers_, 71) and gave it at Court on 25 Jan. 1614 (cf.\r\nApp. B). There seems to be an allusion to Suffolk’s intervention in\r\nChapman’s gratulatory verses to _Sejanus_ (1605):\r\n\r\n    Most Noble Suffolke, who by Nature Noble,\r\n      And judgement vertuous, cannot fall by Fortune,\r\n    Who when our Hearde, came not to drink, but trouble\r\n      The Muses waters, did a Wall importune,\r\n    (Midst of assaults) about their sacred River.\r\n\r\nThe imprisonment was over by Nov. 1605, when Jonson (q.v.) was employed\r\nabout the Gunpowder plot. I put it and the correspondence in Oct. or\r\nNov. The play may have been staged at any time between that and the\r\nstaging of Dekker and Webster’s _Westward Hoe_, late in 1604, to which\r\nits prologue refers. Several attempts have been made to divide up the\r\nplay. Fleay, ii. 81, gives Marston I. i-II. i, Chapman II. ii-IV. i,\r\nJonson IV. ii-V. iv. Parrott gives Marston I. i-II. ii, IV. ii, V. i,\r\nChapman II. iii-IV. i, Jonson the prologue and V. ii-v. Cunliffe gives\r\nMarston I, III. iii and V. i, the rest to Chapman, and nothing to\r\nJonson but plotting and supervision. All make III. iii a Chapman scene,\r\nso that, if Chapman spoke the truth, Marston must have interpolated the\r\nobnoxious clauses.\r\n\r\n                          _May Day. c. 1609_\r\n\r\n1611.

But the force of\r\nthis argument is weakened by the admission of a clear imitation in I.\r\ni. 378 _sqq._ of ch. v. of Dekker’s _Gull’s Hornbook_ (1609), which\r\nit seems to me a little arbitrary to explain by a revision. The other\r\nreasons given by Fleay, i. 57, for a date _c._ 1601 are fantastic. So\r\nis his suggestion that the play is founded on the anonymous _Disguises_\r\nproduced by the Admiral’s on 2 Oct. 1595, which, as pointed out by Greg\r\n(_Henslowe_, ii. 177), rests merely on the fact that the title would be\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\n                    _The Widow’s Tears. 1603 < > 9_\r\n\r\n_S.

Wallace, ii. 115, identifies it with the Chapel play seen by\r\nthe Duke of Stettin in 1602 (cf. ch. xii), but Gerschow’s description\r\nin no way, except for the presence of a widow, fits the plot. The\r\nreference to the ‘number of strange knights abroad’ (iv. 1. 28) and\r\nperhaps also that to the crying down of monopolies (I. i. 125) are\r\nJacobean, rather than Elizabethan (cf. _M. d’Olive_). Fleay, i. 61,\r\nand Parrott think that the satire of justice in the last act shows\r\nresentment at Chapman’s treatment in connexion with _Eastward Ho!_, and\r\nsuggest 1605. It would be equally sound to argue that this is just the\r\ndate when Chapman would have been most careful to avoid criticism of\r\nthis kind. The Epistle says, ‘This poor comedy (of many desired to see\r\nprinted) I thought not utterly unworthy that affectionate design in me’.\r\n\r\n                    _Charles, Duke of Byron. 1608_\r\n\r\n_S.

J. Jusserand in _M. L. R._ vi. 203, from\r\n_Bibl. Nat. MS. Fr._ 15984):\r\n\r\n   ‘Environ la micaresme ces certains comédiens à qui j’avois\r\n   fait deffendre de jouer l’histoire du feu mareschal de Biron,\r\n   voyant toutte la cour dehors, ne laissèrent de le faire, et non\r\n   seulement cela, mais y introduisirent la Royne et Madame de\r\n   Verneuil, la première traitant celle-cy fort mal de paroles,\r\n   et luy donnant un soufflet. En ayant eu advis de-là à quelques\r\n   jours, aussi-tost je m’en allay trouver le Comte de Salsbury\r\n   et luy fis plainte de ce que non seulement ces compaignons-là\r\n   contrevenoient à la deffense qui leur avoit esté faicte, mais\r\n   y adjoustoient des choses non seulement plus importantes, mais\r\n   qui n’avoient que faire avec le mareschal de Biron, et au partir\r\n   de-là estoient toutes faulses, dont en vérité il se montra\r\n   fort courroucé. Et dès l’heure mesme envoya pour les prendre.\r\n   Toutteffois il ne s’en trouva que trois, qui aussi-tost furent\r\n   menez en la prison où ilz sont encore; mais le principal qui\r\n   est le compositeur eschapa. Un jour ou deux devant, ilz avoient\r\n   dépêché leur Roy, sa mine d’Escosse et tous ses Favorits d’une\r\n   estrange sorte; [_in cipher_ car apres luy avoir fait dépiter\r\n   le ciel sur le vol d’un oyseau, et faict battre un gentilhomme\r\n   pour avoir rompu ses chiens, ilz le dépeignoient ivre pour le\r\n   moins une fois le jour. Ce qu’ayant sçu, je pensay qu’il seroit\r\n   assez en colère contre lesdits commédiens, sans que je l’y\r\n   misse davantage, et qu’il valoit mieux référer leur châtiment\r\n   à l’irrévérence qu’ilz lui avoient portée, qu’à ce qu’ilz\r\n   pourroient avoir dit desdites Dames], et pour ce, je me résolus\r\n   de n’en plus parler, mais considérer ce qu’ilz firent. Quand\r\n   ledit Sieur Roy a esté icy, il a tesmoigné estre extrèmement\r\n   irrité contre ces maraults-là, et a commandé qu’ilz soient\r\n   chastiez et surtout qu’on eust à faire diligence de trouver le\r\n   compositeur. Mesme il a fait deffense que l’on n’eust plus à\r\n   jouer de Comédies dedans Londres, pour lever laquelle deffense\r\n   quatre autres compagnies qui y sont encore, offrent desja\r\n   cent mille francs, lesquels pourront bien leur en redonner la\r\n   permission; mais pour le moins sera-ce à condition qu’ilz ne\r\n   représenteront plus aucune histoire moderne ni ne parleront des\r\n   choses du temps à peine de la vie. Si j’eusse creu qu’il y eust\r\n   eu de la suggestion en ce qu’avoient dit lesdits comédiens, j’en\r\n   eusse fait du bruit davantage; mais ayant tout subjet d’estimer\r\n   le contraire, j’ay pensay que le meilleur estoit de ne point le\r\n   remuer davantage, et laisser audit Roy la vengeance de son fait\r\n   mesme. Touttefois si vous jugez de-là, Monsieur; que je n’y aye\r\n   fait assez, il est encore temps.’\r\n\r\nIn _M. L. Review_, iv. 158, I reprinted a less good text from\r\n_Ambassades de M. De La Boderie_ (1750), iii. 196. The letter is\r\noften dated 1605 and ascribed to De La Boderie’s predecessor, M. de\r\nBeaumont, on the strength of a summary in F. L. G. von Raumer, _History\r\nof the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries_, ii. 219. The text has\r\nbeen ruthlessly censored; in particular the peccant scene has been\r\ncut out of Act II of Part ii, and most of Act IV of Part i, dealing\r\nwith Byron’s visit to England, has been suppressed or altered. The\r\nEpistle offers ‘these poor dismembered poems’, and they are probably\r\nthe subject of two undated and unsigned letters printed by Dobell in\r\n_Ath._ (1901), i. 433. The first, to one Mr. Crane, secretary to the\r\nDuke of Lennox, inquires whether the writer can leave a ‘shelter’ to\r\nwhich ‘the austeritie of this offended time’ has sent him. The other\r\nis by ‘the poor subject of your office’ and evidently addressed to the\r\nMaster of the Revels, and complains of his strictness in revising for\r\nthe press what the Council had passed for presentment. Worcester’s men\r\nhad an anonymous play of _Byron_ (_Burone_ or _Berowne_) in 1602, and\r\nGreg (_Henslowe_, ii. 231) thinks that to this Chapman’s may have borne\r\nsome relation. But Chapman’s source was Grimeston, _General Inventorie\r\nof the History of France_ (1607).\r\n\r\n               _The Revenge of Bussy D’Ambois. c. 1610_\r\n\r\n_S.

L._).\r\n\r\nBoas has shown that Chapman used Grimeston, _General Inventorie of\r\nthe History of France_ (1607). Probably the play was written for the\r\nQueen’s Revels to accompany _Bussy_. But whether it was first produced\r\nat Whitefriars in 1609–12, or at Blackfriars in 1608–9, can hardly\r\nbe settled. The title-page and the probability that the _Byron_\r\naffair would render it judicious to defer further plays by Chapman\r\nrather point to the Whitefriars. The Epistle commends the play because\r\n‘Howsoever therefore in the scenical presentation it might meet with\r\nsome maligners, yet considering even therein it passed with approbation\r\nof more worthy judgments’.\r\n\r\n                _Chabot Admiral of France, c. 1613_ (?)\r\n\r\n_S.

But critics agree in finding much of Chapman\r\nin it, and suppose Shirley to have been a reviser rather than a\r\ncollaborator. Parrott regards I. i, II. iii, and V. ii as substantially\r\nChapman; II. i and III. i as substantially Shirley; and the rest\r\nas Chapman revised. He suggests that Chapman’s version was for the\r\nQueen’s Revels _c._ 1613. Fleay, ii. 241, put it in 1604, but it cannot\r\nbe earlier than the 1611 edition of its source, E.

[Another issue.]\r\n\r\nChapman says that the play was written ‘long since’ and ‘never touched\r\nat the stage’. Various dates have been conjectured; the last, Parrott’s\r\n1612–13, ‘based upon somewhat intangible evidence of style and rhythm’\r\nwill do as well as another. Parrott is puzzled by the 1653 title-page\r\nand thinks that, in spite of the Epistle, the play was acted. Might it\r\nnot have been acted by the King’s after the original publication in\r\n1631? Plays on Caesar were so common that it is not worth pursuing the\r\nsuggestion of Fleay, i. 65, that fragments of the Admiral’s anonymous\r\n_Caesar and Pompey_ of 1594–5 may survive here.\r\n\r\n                       _Doubtful and Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nChapman’s lost plays for the Admiral’s men of 1598–9 have already been\r\nnoted. Two plays, ‘The Fatall Love, a French Tragedy’, and ‘A Tragedy\r\nof a Yorkshire Gentlewoman and her sonne’, were entered as his in the\r\n_S. R._ by Humphrey Moseley on 29 June 1660 (Eyre, ii. 271). They\r\nappear, without Chapman’s name, in Warburton’s list of burnt plays\r\n(W. W. Greg in _3 Library_, ii. 231). The improbable ascriptions to\r\nChapman of _The Ball_ (1639) and _Revenge for Honour_ (1654) on their\r\nt.ps. and of _Two Wise Men and All the Rest Fools_ (1619) by Kirkman\r\nin 1661 do not inspire confidence in this late entry, and even if they\r\nwere Chapman’s, the plays were not necessarily of our period. But it\r\nhas been suggested that _Fatal Love_ may be the anonymous _Charlemagne_\r\n(q.v.). J. M. Robertson assigns to Chapman _A Lover’s Complaint_,\r\naccepts the conjecture of Minto and Acheson that he was the ‘rival\r\npoet’ of Shakespeare’s _Sonnets_, believes him to be criticized in the\r\nHolophernes of _L. L. L._ and regards him as the second hand of _Timon\r\nof Athens_, and with varying degrees of assurance as Shakespeare’s\r\npredecessor, collaborator or reviser, in _Per._, _T. C._, _Tp._,\r\n_Ham._, _Cymb._, _J. C._, _T. of S._, _Hen. VI_, _Hen. V_, _C. of E._,\r\n_2 Gent._, _All’s Well_, _M. W._, _K. J._, _Hen. VIII_. These are\r\nissues which cannot be discussed here. The records do not suggest any\r\nassociation between Chapman and the Chamberlain’s or King’s men, except\r\npossibly in Caroline days.\r\n\r\nFor other ascriptions to Chapman, see in ch. xxiv, _Alphonsus_, _Fedele\r\nand Fortunio_, _Sir Giles Goosecap_, _Histriomastix_, and _Second\r\nMaiden’s Tragedy_.\r\n\r\n                                 MASK\r\n\r\n         _Middle Temple and Lincoln’s Inn Mask. 15 Feb. 1613_\r\n\r\n_S.

They dismounted in the\r\ntiltyard, where the King and lords beheld them from a gallery. The\r\nscene represented a high rock, which cracked to emit Capriccio, and\r\nhad the Temple of Honour on one side, and a hollow tree, ‘the bare\r\nreceptacle of the baboonerie’, on the other. After ‘the presentment’\r\nand the ‘anticke’ dance of the ‘ante-maske’, the top of the rock\r\nopened to disclose the maskers and torchbearers in a mine of gold\r\nunder the setting sun. They descended by steps within the rock. First\r\nthe torchbearers ‘performed another ante-maske, dancing with torches\r\nlighted at both ends’. Then the maskers danced two dances, followed by\r\nothers with the ladies, and finally a ‘dance, that brought them off’ to\r\nthe Temple of Honour.\r\n\r\nFor general notices of the wedding masks, see ch. xxiv and the account\r\nof Campion’s Lords’ mask. The German _Beschreibung_ (1613) gives a\r\nlong abstract of Chapman’s (extract in _Sh.-Jahrbuch_, xxix. 172), but\r\nthis is clearly paraphrased from the author’s own description. It was\r\nperhaps natural for Sir Edward Philips to write to Carleton on 25 Feb.\r\n(_S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxxii. 46) that this particular mask was ‘praised\r\nabove all others’. But Chamberlain is no less laudatory (Birch, i. 226):\r\n\r\n   ‘On Monday night, was the Middle Temple and Lincoln’s Inn mask\r\n   prepared in the hall at court, whereas the Lords’ was in the\r\n   banqueting room. It went from the Rolls, all up Fleet Street\r\n   and the Strand, and made such a gallant and glorious show,\r\n   that it is highly commended. They had forty gentlemen of best\r\n   choice out of both houses, and the twelve maskers, with their\r\n   torchbearers and pages, rode likewise upon horses exceedingly\r\n   well trapped and furnished, besides a dozen little boys, dressed\r\n   like baboons, that served for an antimask, and, they say,\r\n   performed it exceedingly well when they came to it; and three\r\n   open chariots, drawn with four horses apiece, that carried their\r\n   musicians and other personages that had parts to speak. All\r\n   which, together with their trumpeters and other attendants, were\r\n   so well set out, that it is generally held for the best show\r\n   that hath been seen many a day. The King stood in the gallery\r\n   to behold them, and made them ride about the Tilt-yard, and\r\n   then they were received into St. James’ Park, and so out, all\r\n   along the galleries, into the hall, where themselves and their\r\n   devices, which they say were excellent, made such a glittering\r\n   show, that the King and all the company were exceedingly\r\n   pleased, and especially with their dancing, which was beyond all\r\n   that hath been seen yet. The King made the masters [? maskers]\r\n   kiss his hand on parting, and gave them many thanks, saying, he\r\n   never saw so many proper men together, and himself accompanied\r\n   them at the banquet, and took care it should be well ordered,\r\n   and speaks much of them behind their backs, and strokes the\r\n   Master of the Rolls and Dick Martin, who were chief doers and\r\n   undertakers.’\r\n\r\nChamberlain wrote more briefly, but with equal commendation, to Winwood\r\n(iii. 435), while the Venetian ambassador reported that the mask was\r\ndanced ‘with such finish that it left nothing to be desired’ (_V.\r\nP._ xii. 532).\r\n\r\nThe mask is but briefly noticed in the published records of the Middle\r\nTemple (Hopwood, 40, 42); more fully in those of Lincoln’s Inn (Walker,\r\nii. 150–6, 163, 170, 198, 255, 271). The Inn’s share of the cost was\r\n£1,086 8_s._ 11_d._ and presumably that of the Middle Temple as much. A\r\nlevy was made of from £1 10_s._ to £4, according to status, and some of\r\nthe benchers and others advanced funds. A dispute about the repayment\r\nof an advance by Lord Chief Justice Richardson was still unsettled in\r\n1634. An account of Christopher Brooke as ‘Expenditour for the maske’\r\nincludes £100 to Inigo Jones for works for the hall and street, £45 to\r\nRobert Johnson for music and songs, £2 to Richard Ansell, matlayer, £1\r\nto the King’s Ushers of the Hall, and payments for a pair of stockings\r\nand other apparel to ‘Heminge’s boy’, and for the services of John\r\nand Robert Dowland, Philip Rosseter and Thomas Ford as musicians. The\r\nattitude of the young lawyer may be illustrated from a letter of Sir\r\nS. Radcliffe on 1 Feb. (_Letters_, 78), although I do not know his\r\nInn: ‘I have taken up 30^s of James Singleton, which or y^e greater\r\npart thereof is to be paid toward y^e great mask at y^e marriage at\r\nShrovetide. It is a duty for y^e honour of our Inn, and unto which I\r\ncould not refuse to contribute with any credit.’\r\n\r\nA letter by Chapman, partly printed by B. Dobell in _Ath._ (1901), i.\r\n466, is a complaint to an unnamed paymaster about his reward for a mask\r\ngiven in the royal presence at a date later than Prince Henry’s death.\r\nWhile others of his faculty got 100 marks or £50, he is ‘put with\r\ntaylors and shoomakers, and such snipperados, to be paid by a bill of\r\nparticulars’. Dobell does not seem to think that this was the wedding\r\nmask, but I see no clear reason why it should not have been.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CHEKE (_c._ 1561).\r\n\r\nIf the translator, as stated in _D. N. B._, was Henry the son of Sir\r\nJohn Cheke and was born _c._ 1548, he must have been a precocious\r\nscholar.\r\n\r\n                          _Free Will > 1561_\r\n\r\n_S.

It is presumably distinct from that which\r\nSir Thomas Hoby in his _Travaile and Life_ (_Camden Misc._ x. 63) says\r\nhe made at Augsburg in Aug.–Nov. 1550, and dedicated to the Marquis of\r\nNorthampton.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CHETTLE (_c._ 1560–> 1607).\r\n\r\nChettle was apprenticed, as the son of Robert Chettle of London, dyer,\r\nto Thomas East, printer, on 29 Sept. 1577, and took up the freedom\r\nof the Stationers’ Company on 6 Oct. 1584. During 1589–91 he was in\r\npartnership as a printer with John Danter and William Hoskins. The\r\npartnership was then dissolved, and Chettle’s imprint is not found\r\non any book of later date (McKerrow, _Dictionary_, 68, 84, 144). But\r\nevidently his connexion with the press and with Danter continued,\r\nfor in 1596 Nashe inserted into _Have With You to Saffron Walden_\r\n(_Works_, iii. 131) a letter from him offering to set up the book and\r\nsigned ‘Your old Compositer, Henry Chettle’. Nashe’s _Strange News_\r\n(1592) and _Terrors of the Night_ (1594) had come, like _Have With\r\nYou to Saffron Walden_ itself, from Danter’s press. The object of\r\nthe letter was to defend Nashe against a charge in Gabriel Harvey’s\r\n_Pierce’s Supererogation_ (1593) of having abused Chettle. He had in\r\nfact in _Pierce Penilesse_ (1592) called _Greenes Groats-worth of Wit_\r\n‘a scald triuial lying pamphlet’, and none of his doing. And of the\r\n_Groats-worth_ Chettle had acted as editor, as he himself explains\r\nin the Epistle to his _Kind Hearts Dream_ (cf. App. C, No. xlix), in\r\nwhich, however, he exculpates Nashe from any share in the book. By\r\n1595 he was married and had lost a daughter Mary, who was buried at\r\nSt. John’s, Windsor (E. Ashmole, _Antiquities of Berkshire_, iii. 75).\r\nBy 1598 he had taken to writing for the stage, and in his _Palladis\r\nTamia_ of that year Meres includes him in ‘the best for Comedy amongst\r\nvs’. Of all Henslowe’s band of needy writers for the Admiral’s and\r\nWorcester’s from 1598 to 1603, he was the most prolific and one of the\r\nneediest. Of the forty-eight plays in which he had a hand during this\r\nperiod, no more than five, or possibly six, survive. His personal loans\r\nfrom Henslowe were numerous and often very small. Some were on account\r\nof the Admiral’s; others on a private account noted in the margin of\r\nHenslowe’s diary. On 16 Sept. 1598 he owed the Admiral’s £8 9_s._\r\nin balance, ‘al his boockes & recknynges payd’. In Nov. 1598 he had\r\nloans ‘for to areste one with Lord Lester’. In Jan. 1599 he was in the\r\nMarshalsea, and in May borrowed to avoid arrest by one Ingrome. On 25\r\nMar. 1602 he was driven, apparently in view of a payment of £3, to seal\r\na bond to write for the Admiral’s. This did not prevent him from also\r\nwriting for Worcester’s in the autumn. More than once his manuscript\r\nhad to be redeemed from pawn (Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 250). His\r\n_England’s Mourning Garment_, a eulogy of Elizabeth, is reprinted in\r\nC. M. Ingleby, _Shakespere Allusion-Books_, Part i (_N. S. S._ 1874),\r\n77. Herein he speaks of himself as ‘courting it now and than’, when he\r\nwas ‘yong, almost thirtie yeeres agoe’, and calls on a number of poets\r\nunder fanciful names to sing the dead queen’s praise. They are Daniel,\r\nWarner, Chapman (Coryn), Jonson (our English Horace), Shakespeare\r\n(Melicert), Drayton (Coridon), Lodge (Musidore), Dekker (Antihorace),\r\nMarston (Moelibee), and Petowe (?). Chettle was therefore alive in\r\n1603, but he is spoken of as dead in Dekker’s _Knight’s Conjuring_\r\n(1607).\r\n\r\n                                 PLAYS\r\n\r\n           _The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntingdon. 1598_\r\n\r\n            _The Death of Robert Earl of Huntingdon. 1598_\r\n\r\nFor Chettle’s relation to these two plays, see s.v.

L.\r\nA._ xvii. 125).\r\n\r\nHenslowe paid Chettle, on behalf of the Admiral’s, £1 in earnest of\r\n‘a Danyshe tragedy’ on 7 July 1602, and 5_s._ in part payment for a\r\ntragedy of ‘Howghman’ on 29 Dec. It seems natural to take the latter,\r\nand perhaps also the former, entry as relating to this play, although\r\nit does not bear Chettle’s name on the title-page. But its completion\r\nwas presumably later than the termination of Henslowe’s record in 1603.\r\nGreg (_Henslowe_, ii. 226) rightly repudiates the suggestion of Fleay,\r\ni. 70, 291, that we are justified in regarding _Hoffman_ the unnamed\r\ntragedy of Chettle and Heywood in Jan. 1603, for which a blank can of\r\ncourse afford no evidence. But ‘the Prince of the burning crowne’ is\r\nreferred to in Kempe’s _Nine Daies Wonder_, 22, not as a ‘play’, but as\r\na suggested theme for a ballad writer.\r\n\r\n                       _Doubtful and Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nChettle’s hand has been suggested in the anonymous _Trial of Chivalry_\r\n(_vide infra_) and _The Weakest Goeth to the Wall_.\r\n\r\nThe following is a complete list of the plays, wholly or partly by\r\nChettle, recorded in Henslowe’s diary.\r\n\r\n              (_a_) _Plays for the Admiral’s, 1598–1603_\r\n\r\n(i), (ii) _1, 2 Robin Hood._\r\n\r\nWith Munday (q.v.), Feb.–Mar. and Nov. 1598.\r\n\r\n(iii) _The Famous Wars of Henry I and the Prince of Wales._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker (q.v.) and Drayton, Mar. 1598.\r\n\r\n(iv), (v) _1, 2 Earl Godwin and His Three Sons._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker, Drayton, and Wilson, March-June 1598.\r\n\r\n(vi) _Pierce of Exton._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker, Drayton, and Wilson, April 1598, but apparently not\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n(vii), (viii) _1, 2 Black Bateman of the North._\r\n\r\nWith Wilson, and for Part 1, Dekker and Drayton, May–July 1598.\r\n\r\n(ix) _The Funeral of Richard Cœur-de-Lion._\r\n\r\nWith Drayton, Munday, and Wilson, June 1598.\r\n\r\n(x) _A Woman’s Tragedy._\r\n\r\nJuly 1598, but apparently unfinished.\r\n\r\n(xi) _Hot Anger Soon Cold._\r\n\r\nWith Jonson and Porter, Aug. 1598.\r\n\r\n(xii) _Chance Medley._\r\n\r\nBy Chettle or Dekker, Drayton, Munday, and Wilson, Aug. 1598.\r\n\r\n(xiii) _Catiline’s Conspiracy._\r\n\r\nWith Wilson, Aug. 1598, but apparently not finished.\r\n\r\n(xiv) _Vayvode._\r\n\r\nApparently an old play revised by Chettle, Aug. 1598.\r\n\r\n(xv) _2 Brute._\r\n\r\nSept.–Oct. 1598.\r\n\r\n(xvi) _’Tis no Deceit to Deceive the Deceiver._\r\n\r\nNov. 1598, but apparently not finished.\r\n\r\n(xvii) _Polyphemus, or Troy’s Revenge._\r\n\r\nFeb. 1599.\r\n\r\n(xviii) _The Spencers._\r\n\r\nWith Porter, March 1599.\r\n\r\n(xix) _Troilus and Cressida._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker (q.v.), April 1599.\r\n\r\n(xx) _Agamemnon, or Orestes Furious._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker, May 1599.\r\n\r\n(xxi) _The Stepmother’s Tragedy._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker, Aug.–Oct. 1599.\r\n\r\n(xxii) _Robert II or The Scot’s Tragedy._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker, Jonson, and possibly Marston (q.v.), Sept. 1599.\r\n\r\n(xxiii) _Patient Grissell._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker (q.v.) and Haughton, Oct.–Dec. 1599.\r\n\r\n(xxiv) _The Orphan’s Tragedy._\r\n\r\nNov. 1599–Sept. 1601, but apparently not finished, unless Greg rightly\r\ntraces it in Yarington’s _Two Lamentable Tragedies_ (q.v.).\r\n\r\n(xxv) _The Arcadian Virgin._\r\n\r\nWith Haughton, Dec. 1599, but apparently not finished.\r\n\r\n(xxvi) _Damon and Pythias._\r\n\r\nFeb.–May 1600.\r\n\r\n(xxvii) _The Seven Wise Masters._\r\n\r\nWith Day, Dekker, and Haughton, March 1600.\r\n\r\n(xxviii) _The Golden Ass_, or _Cupid and Psyche_.\r\n\r\nWith Day and Dekker, April-May 1600; on possible borrowings from this,\r\ncf. s.v.

Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 218). Chettle was ‘mendynge’\r\n_The Life_ in May–June 1602, and on 25 July Richard Hadsor wrote to Sir\r\nR.

W. Adnitt in _Shropshire\r\nArch. Soc. Trans._ iii (1880), 1, with a bibliography of his numerous\r\npoems. For his share in the devices of the Bristol entertainment\r\n(_1574_) and the Suffolk and Norfolk progress (_1578_), of both of\r\nwhich he published descriptions, cf. ch. xxiv. He was also engaged\r\nby the Shrewsbury corporation to prepare a show for an expected but\r\nabandoned royal visit in 1575 (_Mediaeval Stage_, ii. 255). His _A\r\nHandful of Gladsome Verses given to the Queenes Maiesty at Woodstocke\r\nthis Prograce_ (1592) is reprinted in H. Huth and W. C. Hazlitt,\r\n_Fugitive Tracts_ (1875), i. It is not mimetic. His own account of\r\nhis work in _Churchyard’s Challenge_ (1593) suggests that he took a\r\nconsiderable part in Elizabethan pageantry. He says that he wrote:\r\n\r\n   ‘The deuises of warre and a play at Awsterley. Her Highnes being\r\n   at Sir Thomas Greshams’,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n   ‘The deuises and speeches that men and boyes shewed within many\r\n   prograces’.\r\n\r\nAnd amongst ‘Workes ... gotten from me of some such noble friends as I\r\nam loath to offend’ he includes:\r\n\r\n   ‘A book of a sumptuous shew in Shrouetide, by Sir Walter Rawley,\r\n   Sir Robart Carey, M. Chidley, and M. Arthur Gorge, in which book\r\n   was the whole seruice of my L. of Lester mencioned that he and\r\n   his traine did in Flaunders, and the gentlemen Pencioners proued\r\n   to be a great peece of honor to the Court: all which book was in\r\n   as good verse as euer I made: an honorable knight, dwelling in\r\n   the Black-Friers, can witness the same, because I read it vnto\r\n   him.’\r\n\r\nThe natural date for this ‘shew’ is Shrovetide 1587. I do not know why\r\nNichols, _Eliz._ ii. 279, dates the Osterley device 1579. Elizabeth was\r\noften there, but I find no evidence of a visit in 1579. Lowndes speaks\r\nof the work as in print, but I doubt whether he has any authority\r\nbeyond Churchyard’s own notice, which does not prove publication.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHONY CHUTE (_ob. c._ 1595).\r\n\r\nNashe in his _Have With You to Saffron Walden_ (1596, _Works_, iii.\r\n107), attacking Chute as a friend of Gabriel Harvey, says, ‘he hath\r\nkneaded and daub’d vp a Commedie, called The transformation of the\r\nKing of _Trinidadoes_ two Daughters, Madame _Panachaea_ and the Nymphe\r\n_Tobacco_; and, to approue his Heraldrie, scutchend out the honorable\r\nArmes of the smoakie Societie’. I hesitate to take this literally.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE CLIFFORD (1558–1605).\r\n\r\nGeorge Clifford was born 8 Aug. 1558, succeeded as third Earl of\r\nCumberland 8 Jan. 1570, and died 30 Oct. 1605. A recent biography\r\nis G. C. Williamson, _George, Third Earl of Cumberland_ (1920). He\r\nmarried Margaret Russell, daughter of Francis, second Earl of Bedford,\r\non 24 June 1577. His daughter, Anne Clifford, who left an interesting\r\nautobiography, married firstly Richard, third Earl of Dorset, and\r\nsecondly Philip, fourth Earl of Pembroke. Cumberland was prominent in\r\nElizabethan naval adventure and shone in the tilt. He is recorded as\r\nappearing on 17 Nov. 1587 (Gawdy, 25) and 26 Aug. 1588 (_Sp. P._ iv.\r\n419). On 17 Nov. 1590 he succeeded Sir Henry Lee (q.v.) as Knight of\r\nthe Crown. Thereafter he was the regular challenger for the Queen’s\r\nDay tilt, often with the assistance of the Earl of Essex. On 17 Nov.\r\n1592 they came together armed into the privy chamber, and issued a\r\nchallenge to maintain against all comers on the following 26 Feb. ‘that\r\nther M. is most worthyest and most fayrest Amadis de Gaule’ (Gawdy,\r\n67). Cumberland’s tiltyard speeches, as Knight of Pendragon Castle, in\r\n1591 (misdated 1592) and 1593 are printed by Williamson, 108, 121, from\r\nmanuscripts at Appleby Castle.\r\n\r\nHis appearance as Knight of the Crown on 17 Nov. 1595 is noted in\r\nPeele’s (q.v.) _Anglorum Feriae_. In F. Davison’s _Poetical Rhapsody_\r\n(1602, ed. Bullen, ii. 128) is an ode _Of Cynthia_, with the note ‘This\r\nSong was sung before her sacred Maiestie at a shew on horse-backe,\r\nwherwith the right Honorable the Earle of Cumberland presented her\r\nHighnesse on Maie day last’. This is reprinted by R. W. Bond (_Lyly_,\r\ni. 414) with alternative ascriptions to Lyly and to Sir John Davies.\r\nBut Cumberland himself wrote verses. I do not know why Bullen and\r\nBond assume that the show was on 1 May 1600. The _Cumberland MSS._\r\nat Bolton, Yorkshire, once contained a prose speech, now lost, in\r\nthe character of a melancholy knight, headed ‘A Copie of my Lord of\r\nCombrlandes Speeche to y^e Queene, upon y^e 17 day of November, 1600’.\r\nThis was printed by T. D. Whitaker, _History of Craven_ (1805, ed.\r\nMorant, 1878, p. 355), and reprinted by Nichols, _Eliz._ iii. 522, and\r\nby Bond, _Lyly_, i. 415, with a conjectural attribution to Lyly. In\r\n1601 Cumberland conveyed to Sir John Davies a suggestion from Sir R.\r\nCecil that he should write a ‘speech for introduction of the barriers’\r\n(_Hatfield MSS._ xi. 544), and in letters of 1602 he promised Cecil to\r\nappear at the tilt on Queen’s Day, but later tried to excuse himself\r\non the ground that a damaged arm would not let him carry a staff\r\n(_Hatfield MSS._ xii. 438, 459, 574). Anne Clifford records ‘speeches\r\nand delicate presents’ at Grafton when James and Anne visited the Earl\r\nthere on 27 June 1603 (Wiffen, ii. 71).\r\n\r\n\r\nJO. COOKE (_c._ 1612).\r\n\r\nBeyond his play, practically nothing is known of Cooke. It is not even\r\nclear whether ‘Jo.’ stands for John, or for Joshua; the latter is\r\nsuggested by the manuscript ascription on a copy of the anonymous _How\r\na Man may Choose a Good Wife from a Bad_ (q.v.). Can Cooke be identical\r\nwith the I. Cocke who contributed to Stephens’s _Characters_ in 1615\r\n(cf. App. C, No. lx)? Collier, iii. 408, conjectures that he was a\r\nbrother John named, probably as dead, in the will (3 Jan. 1614) of\r\nAlexander Cooke the actor (cf. ch. xv). There is an entry in S. R. on\r\n22 May 1604 of a lost ‘Fyftie epigrams written by J. Cooke Gent’, and a\r\n‘I. Cooke’ wrote commendatory verses to Drayton’s _Legend of Cromwell_\r\n(1607).\r\n\r\n             _Greenes Tu Quoque or The City Gallant. 1611_\r\n\r\n1614.

T._).\r\n\r\nHeywood writes ‘to gratulate the love and memory of my worthy friend\r\nthe author, and my entirely beloved fellow the actor’, both of whom\r\nwere evidently dead. Satire of Coryat’s _Crudities_ gives a date\r\nbetween its publication in 1611 and the performances of the play by the\r\nQueen’s men at Court on 27 Dec. 1611 and 2 Feb. 1612 (cf. App. B). In\r\nAug. 1612 died Thomas Greene, who had evidently played Bubble at the\r\nRed Bull (ed. Dodsley, p. 240):\r\n\r\n   _Geraldine._ Why, then, we’ll go to the Red Bull: they say\r\n   Green’s a good clown.\r\n\r\n   _Bubble._ Green! Green’s an ass.\r\n\r\n   _Scattergood._ Wherefore do you say so?\r\n\r\n   _Bubble._ Indeed I ha’ no reason; for they say he is as\r\n   like me as ever he can look.\r\n\r\nChetwood’s assertion of a 1599 print is negligible. The Queen of\r\nBohemia’s men revived the play at Court on 6 Jan. 1625 (_Variorum_,\r\niii. 228).\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUILA CRUSO (_c._ 1610).\r\n\r\nAuthor of the academic _Euribates Pseudomagus_ (cf. App. K).\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT DABORNE (?-1628).\r\n\r\nDaborne claimed to be of ‘generous’ descent, and it has been\r\nconjectured that he belonged to a family at Guildford, Surrey. Nothing\r\nis known of him until he appears with Rosseter and others as a patentee\r\nfor the Queen’s Revels in 1610. Presumably he wrote for this company,\r\nand when they amalgamated with the Lady Elizabeth’s in 1613 came into\r\nrelations with Henslowe, who acted as paymaster for the combination.\r\nThe Dulwich collection contains between thirty and forty letters,\r\nbonds, and receipts bearing upon these relations. A few are undated;\r\nthe rest extend from 17 April 1613 to 4 July 1615. Most of them were\r\nprinted by Malone (_Variorum_, iii. 336), Collier (_Alleyn Papers_,\r\n56), and Swaen (_Anglia_, xx. 155), and all, with a stray fragment from\r\n_Egerton MS._ 2623, f. 24, are in Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, 65, 126.\r\nThere and in _Henslowe_, ii. 141, Dr. Greg attempts an arrangement\r\nof them and of the plays to which they relate, which seems to me\r\nsubstantially sound. They show Daborne, during the twelve months from\r\nApril 1613, to which they mainly belong, writing regularly for the Lady\r\nElizabeth’s, but prepared at any moment to sell a play to the King’s\r\nif he can get a better bargain. Lawsuits and general poverty made him\r\nconstantly desirous of obtaining small advances from Henslowe, and on\r\none occasion he was in the Clink. In the course of the year he was at\r\nwork on at least five plays (_vide infra_), alone or in co-operation\r\nnow with Tourneur, now with Field, Massinger, and Fletcher. Modern\r\nconjectures have assigned him some share in plays of the Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher series which there is no external evidence to connect\r\nwith his name. However this may be, it is clear that, unless his\r\nactivity in 1613–14 was abnormal, he must have written much of which\r\nwe know nothing. He is still traceable in connexion with the stage up\r\nto 1616, giving a joint bond with Massinger in Aug. 1615, receiving\r\nan acquittance of debts through his wife Francisce from Henslowe on\r\nhis death-bed in Jan. 1616 (_Henslowe_, ii. 20), and witnessing the\r\nagreement between Alleyn and Meade and Prince Charles’s men on the\r\nfollowing 20 March. But he must have taken orders by 1618, when he\r\npublished a sermon, and he became Chancellor of Waterford in 1619,\r\nPrebendary of Lismore in 1620, and Dean of Lismore in 1621. On 23 March\r\n1628 he ‘died amphibious by the ministry’ according to _The Time Poets_\r\n(_Choice Drollery_, 1656, sig. B).\r\n\r\n                             _Collection_\r\n\r\n1898–9. A. E. H.

It appears to be indebted to pamphlets on the career\r\nof its heroes, printed in 1609. The Epistle explains the publishing\r\nof ‘this oppressed and much martird Tragedy, not that I promise to my\r\nselfe any reputation hereby, or affect to see my name in Print, vsherd\r\nwith new praises, for feare the Reader should call in question their\r\niudgements that giue applause in the action; for had this wind moued\r\nme, I had preuented others shame in subscribing some of my former\r\nlabors, or let them gone out in the diuels name alone; which since\r\nimpudence will not suffer, I am content they passe together; it is then\r\nto publish my innocence concerning the wrong of worthy personages,\r\ntogether with doing some right to the much-suffering Actors that hath\r\ncaused my name to cast it selfe in the common rack of censure’. I do\r\nnot know why the play should have been ‘martir’d’, but incidentally\r\nDaborne seems to be claiming a share in Dekker’s _If It be not Good,\r\nthe Devil is in It_ (1612).\r\n\r\n                 _The Poor Man’s Comfort, c. 1617_ (?)\r\n\r\n[_MS._] _Egerton MS._ 1994, f. 268.\r\n\r\n[Scribal signature ‘By P.

Perhaps\r\nwe have here the names of two actors, Ellis Worth, who was with Anne’s\r\nmen at the Cockpit in 1617–19, and Gregory Sanderson, who joined\r\nthe same company before May, 1619. But there is also a James Sands,\r\ntraceable as a boy of the King’s in 1605. The performances named on the\r\ntitle-page are not necessarily the original ones and the play may have\r\nbeen produced by the Queen’s at the Red Bull, but 1617 is as likely a\r\ndate as another, and when a courtier says of a poor man’s suit (l. 877)\r\nthat it is ‘some suit from porters hall, belike not worth begging’,\r\nthere may conceivably be an allusion to attempts to preserve the\r\nPorter’s Hall theatre from destruction in the latter year. In any case,\r\nDaborne is not likely to have written the play after he took orders.\r\n\r\n                       _Doubtful and Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nThe Henslowe correspondence appears to show Daborne as engaged between\r\n17 April 1613 and 2 April 1614 on the following plays:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Machiavel and the Devil_ (17 April-_c._ 25 June 1613), possibly,\r\naccording to Fleay and Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 152, based on the old\r\n_Machiavel_ revived by Strange’s men in 1592.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Arraignment of London_, probably identical with _The Bellman\r\nof London_ (5 June–9 Dec. 1613), with Cyril Tourneur, possibly, as\r\nGreg, _Henslowe Papers_, 75, suggests, based on Dekker’s tract, _The\r\nBellman of London_ (1608).\r\n\r\n(_c_) An unnamed play with Field, Massinger, and Fletcher, the subject\r\nof undated correspondence (_Henslowe Papers_, 65 and possibly 70, 84)\r\nand possibly also of dated letters of July 1613 (_H. P._ 74).\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Owl_ (9 Dec. 1613–28 March 1614). A comedy of this name\r\nis in Archer’s list of 1656, but Greg, _Masques_, xcv, thinks that\r\nJonson’s _Mask of Owls_ may be meant.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The She Saint_ (2 April 1614).\r\n\r\nDaborne has been suggested as a contributor to the _Cupid’s Revenge_,\r\n_Faithful Friends_, _Honest Man’s Fortune_, _Thierry and Theodoret_,\r\nand later plays of the Beaumont (q.v.) and Fletcher series, and\r\nattempts have been made to identify more than one of these with (_c_)\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL DANIEL (_c._ 1563–1619).\r\n\r\nDaniel was born in Somerset, probably near Taunton, about 1563. His\r\nfather is said to have been John Daniel, a musician; he certainly had\r\na brother John, of the same profession. In 1579 he entered Magdalen\r\nHall, Oxford, but took no degree. He visited France about January 1585\r\nand sent an account of political affairs from the Rue St. Jacques to\r\nWalsingham in the following March (_S. P. F._ xix. 388). His first\r\nwork was a translation of the _Imprese_ of Paulus Jovius (1585). In\r\n1586 he served Sir Edward Stafford, the English ambassador in Paris,\r\nand as a young man visited Italy. He was domesticated at Wilton, and\r\nunder the patronage of Mary, Lady Pembroke, wrote his sonnets to Delia,\r\nthe publication of which, partial in 1591 and complete in 1592, gave\r\nhim a considerable reputation as a poet. The attempt of Fleay, i. 86,\r\nto identify Delia with Elizabeth Carey, daughter of Sir George Carey,\r\nafterwards Lord Hunsdon, breaks down. Nashe in _The Terrors of the\r\nNight_ (1594, ed. McKerrow, i. 342) calls her a ‘second Delia’, and\r\nobviously the first was not, as Fleay suggests, Queen Elizabeth, but\r\nthe heroine of the sonnets. Delia dwelt on an Avon, but the fact that\r\nin 1602 Lord Hunsdon took the waters at Bath does not give him a seat\r\non the Avon there. Lady Pembroke’s _Octavia_ (q.v.) inspired Daniel’s\r\nbook-drama _Cleopatra_ (1594). Other poems, notably _The History of\r\nthe Civil Wars_ (1595), followed. Tradition makes Daniel poet laureate\r\nafter Spenser’s death in 1599. There was probably no such post, but it\r\nis clear from verses prefixed to a single copy (B.M.C. 21, 2, 17) of\r\nthe _Works_ of 1601, which are clearly addressed to Elizabeth, and not,\r\nas Grosart, i. 2, says, Anne, that he had some allowance at Court:\r\n\r\n    I, who by that most blessed hand sustain’d,\r\n    In quietnes, do eate the bread of rest.\r\n                               (Grosart, i. 9.)\r\n\r\nPossibly, however, this grant was a little later than 1599. Daniel\r\nacted as tutor to Anne Clifford, daughter of the Earl of Cumberland,\r\nat Skipton Castle, probably by 1599, when he published his _Poetical\r\nEssays_, which include an _Epistle_ to Lady Cumberland. It might have\r\nbeen either Herbert or Clifford influence which brought him into favour\r\nwith Lady Bedford and led to his selection as poet for the first\r\nQueen’s mask at the Christmas of 1603. No doubt this preference aroused\r\njealousies, and to about this date one may reasonably assign Jonson’s\r\nverse-letter to Lady Rutland (_The Forest_, xii) in which he speaks of\r\nhis devotion to Lady Bedford:\r\n\r\n          though she have a better verser got,\r\n    (Or Poet, in the court-account), than I,\r\n    And who doth me, though I not him envy.\r\n\r\nIn 1619 Jonson told Drummond that he had answered Daniel’s _Defence\r\nof Ryme_ (?1603), that ‘Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no\r\nchildren; but no poet’, and that ‘Daniel was at jealousies with him’\r\n(Laing, 1, 2, 10). All this suggests to me a rivalry at the Jacobean,\r\nrather than the Elizabethan Court, and I concur in the criticisms of\r\nSmall, 181, upon the elaborate attempts of Fleay, i. 84, 359, to trace\r\nattacks on Daniel in Jonson’s earlier comedies. Fleay makes Daniel\r\nFastidious Brisk in _Every Man Out of his Humour_, Hedon in _Cynthia’s\r\nRevels_, and alternatively Hermogenes Tigellius and Tibullus in _The\r\nPoetaster_, as well as Emulo in the _Patient Grissel_ of Dekker and\r\nothers. In most of these equations he is followed by others, notably\r\nPenniman, who adds (_Poetaster_, xxxvii) Matheo in _Every Man In his\r\nHumour_ and Gullio in the anonymous _1 Return from Parnassus_. For\r\nall this the only basis is that Brisk, Matheo, and Gullio imitate or\r\nparody Daniel’s poetry. What other poetry, then, would affected young\r\nmen at the end of the sixteenth century be likely to imitate? Some\r\nindirect literary criticism on Daniel may be implied, but this does\r\nnot constitute the imitators portraits of Daniel. Fleay’s further\r\nidentifications of Daniel with Littlewit in _Bartholomew Fair_ and\r\nDacus in the _Epigrams_ of Sir John Davies are equally unsatisfactory.\r\nTo return to biography. In 1604 Daniel, for the first time so far as\r\nis known, became connected with the stage, through his appointment as\r\nlicenser for the Queen’s Revels by their patent of 4 Feb. Collier, _New\r\nFacts_, 47, prints, as preserved at Bridgewater House, two undated\r\nletters from Daniel to Sir Thomas Egerton. One, intended to suggest\r\nthat Shakespeare was a rival candidate for the post in the Queen’s\r\nRevels, is a forgery, and this makes it impossible to attach much\r\ncredit to the other, in which the writer mentions the ‘preferment\r\nof my brother’ and that he himself has ‘bene constrayned to live\r\nwith children’. Moreover, the manuscript was not forthcoming in 1861\r\n(Ingleby, 247, 307). Daniel evidently took a part in the management of\r\nthe Revels company; the indiscretion of his _Philotas_ did not prevent\r\nhim from acting as payee for their plays of 1604–5. But his connexion\r\nwith them probably ceased when _Eastward Ho!_ led, later in 1605, to\r\nthe withdrawal of Anne’s patronage. The irrepressible Mr. Fleay (i.\r\n110) thinks that they then satirized him as Damoetas in Day’s _Isle\r\nof Gulls_ (1606). Daniel wrote one more mask and two pastorals, all\r\nfor Court performances. By 1607 he was Groom of Anne’s Privy Chamber,\r\nand by 1613 Gentleman Extraordinary of the same Chamber. In 1615 his\r\nbrother John obtained through his influence a patent for the Children\r\nof the Queen’s Chamber of Bristol (cf. ch. xii). He is said to have had\r\na wife Justina, who was probably the sister of John Florio, whom he\r\ncalled ‘brother’ in 1611. The suggestion of Bolton Corney (_3 N. Q._\r\nviii. 4, 40, 52) that this only meant fellow servant of the Queen is\r\nnot plausible; this relation would have been expressed by ‘fellow’. He\r\nhad a house in Old Street, but kept up his Somerset connexion, and was\r\nburied at Beckington, where he had a farm named Ridge, in Oct. 1619.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1599.

From the Apology,\r\nmotived by ‘the wrong application and misconceiving’ of it, I extract:\r\n\r\n   ‘Above eight yeares since [1596], meeting with my deare friend\r\n   D. Lateware, (whose memory I reverence) in his Lords Chamber\r\n   and mine, I told him the purpose I had for _Philotas_: who\r\n   sayd that himselfe had written the same argument, and caused\r\n   it to be presented in St. John’s Colledge in Oxford; where\r\n   as I after heard, it was worthily and with great applause\r\n   performed.... And living in the Country, about foure yeares\r\n   since, and neere halfe a yeare before the late Tragedy of ours\r\n   (whereunto this is now most ignorantly resembled) unfortunately\r\n   fell out heere in England [Sept., 1600], I began the same,\r\n   and wrote three Acts thereof,--as many to whom I then shewed\r\n   it can witnesse,--purposing to have had it presented in Bath\r\n   by certaine Gentlemens sonnes, as a private recreation for\r\n   the Christmas, before the Shrovetide of that unhappy disorder\r\n   [Feb. 1601]. But by reason of some occasion then falling out,\r\n   and being called upon by my Printer for a new impression of my\r\n   workes, with some additions to the Civill Warres, I intermitted\r\n   this other subject. Which now lying by mee, and driven by\r\n   necessity to make use of my pen, and the Stage to bee the\r\n   mouth of my lines, which before were never heard to speake\r\n   but in silence, I thought the representing so true a History,\r\n   in the ancient forme of a Tragedy, could not but have had\r\n   an unreproveable passage with the time, and the better sort\r\n   of men; seeing with what idle fictions, and grosse follies,\r\n   the Stage at this day abused mens recreations.... And for any\r\n   resemblance, that thorough the ignorance of the History may be\r\n   applied to the late Earle of Essex, it can hold in no proportion\r\n   but only in his weaknesses, which I would wish all that love\r\n   his memory not to revive. And for mine owne part, having beene\r\n   perticularly beholding to his bounty, I would to God his errors\r\n   and disobedience to his Sovereigne might be so deepe buried\r\n   underneath the earth, and in so low a tombe from his other\r\n   parts, that hee might never be remembered among the examples\r\n   of disloyalty in this Kingdome, or paraleld with Forreine\r\n   Conspirators.’\r\n\r\nThe Apology is fixed by its own data to the autumn of 1604, and the\r\nperformance was pretty clearly by the Queen’s Revels in the same year.\r\nDaniel was called before the Privy Council on account of the play, and\r\nused the name of the Earl of Devonshire in his defence. The earl was\r\ndispleased and a letter of excuse from Daniel is extant (Grosart, i.\r\nxxii, from _S. P. D. Jac. I, 1603–10_, p. 18) in which, after asserting\r\nthat he had satisfied Lord Cranborne [Robert Cecil], he says:\r\n\r\n   ‘First I tolde the Lordes I had written 3 Acts of this tragedie\r\n   the Christmas before my L. of Essex troubles, as diuers in the\r\n   cittie could witnes. I saide the maister of the Revells had\r\n   pervsed it. I said I had read some parte of it to your honour,\r\n   and this I said having none els of powre to grace mee now in\r\n   Corte & hoping that you out of your knowledg of bookes, or\r\n   fauour of letters & mee, might answere that there is nothing\r\n   in it disagreeing nor any thing, as I protest there is not,\r\n   but out of the vniuersall notions of ambition and envie, the\r\n   perpetuall argumentes of books or tragedies. I did not say you\r\n   incouraged me vnto the presenting of it; yf I should I had beene\r\n   a villayne, for that when I shewd it to your honour I was not\r\n   resolud to haue had it acted, nor should it haue bene had not my\r\n   necessities ouermaistred mee.’\r\n\r\n                      _The Queen’s Arcadia. 1605_\r\n\r\n_S.

It was, however, put off until Candlemas, doubtless to avoid\r\ncompetition with Somerset’s wedding, and appears from the dedication\r\nalso to have served for a house-warming, to which Anne invited James\r\non the completion of some alterations to Somerset House. Finett\r\n(_Philoxenis_, 16), who describes the complications caused by an\r\ninvitation to the French ambassador, gives the date as 2 Feb., which is\r\nin itself the more probable; but John Chamberlain gives 3 Feb., unless\r\nthere is an error in the dating of the two letters to Carleton, cited\r\nby Greg from _Addl. MS._ 4173, ff. 368, 371, as of 3 and 10 Feb. In\r\nthe first he writes, ‘This day the Lord of Roxburgh marries M^{rs}.\r\nJane Drummond at Somerset House, whither the King is invited to lie\r\nthis night; & shall be entertained with shews & devices, specially a\r\nPastoral, that shall be represented in a little square paved Court’;\r\nand in the second, ‘This day sevennight the Lord of Roxburgh married\r\nM^{rs}. Jane Drummond at Somerset House or Queen’s Court (as it must\r\nnow be called). The King tarried there till Saturday after dinner. The\r\nEntertainment was great, & cost the Queen, as she says, above 3000£.\r\nThe Pastoral made by Samuel Daniel was solemn & dull; but perhaps\r\nbetter to be read than represented.’ Gawdy, 175, also mentions the\r\n‘pastoral’.

A.\r\nEvans (1897, _English Masques_).\r\n\r\nThe maskers, in various colours and with appropriate emblems, were\r\ntwelve Goddesses, and were attended by torchbearers (cf. Carleton,\r\n_infra_); the presenters, ‘for the introducing this show’, Night,\r\nSleep, Iris, Sibylla, and the Graces; the cornets, Satyrs.\r\n\r\nThe locality was the Hall at Hampton Court. At the lower end was a\r\nmountain, from which the maskers descended, and in which the cornets\r\nplayed; at the upper end the cave of Sleep and, on the left (Carleton),\r\na temple of Peace, in the cupola of which was ‘the consort music’,\r\nwhile viols and lutes were ‘on one side of the hall’.\r\n\r\nThe maskers presented their emblems, which Sibylla laid upon the altar\r\nof the temple. They danced ‘their own measures’, then took out the\r\nlords for ‘certain measures, galliards, and corantoes’, and after a\r\n‘short departing dance’ reascended the mountain.\r\n\r\nThis was a Queen’s mask, danced, according to manuscript notes in a\r\ncopy of the Allde edition (B.M. 161, a. 41) thought by Mr. Law to\r\nbe ‘in a hand very like Lord Worcester’s’ (_vide infra_), and\r\npossibly identical with the ‘original MS. of this mask’ from which the\r\nsame names are given in Collier, i. 347, by the Queen (Pallas), the\r\nCountesses of Suffolk (Juno), Hertford (Diana), Bedford (Vesta), Derby\r\n(Proserpine), and Nottingham (Concordia), and the Ladies Rich (Venus),\r\nHatton (Macaria), Walsingham (Astraea), Susan Vere (Flora), Dorothy\r\nHastings (Ceres), and Elizabeth Howard (Tethys).\r\n\r\nAnticipations of masks at Court during the winter of 1603–4 are to\r\nbe found in letters to Lord Shrewsbury from Arabella Stuart on 18\r\nDec. (Bradley, ii. 193), ‘The Queene intendeth to make a Mask this\r\nChristmas, to which end my Lady of Suffolk and my Lady Walsingham hath\r\nwarrants to take of the late Queenes best apparell out of the Tower at\r\ntheyr discretion. Certain Noblemen (whom I may not yet name to you,\r\nbecause some of them have made me of theyr counsell) intend another.\r\nCertain gentlemen of good sort another’; from Cecil on 23 Dec. (Lodge,\r\niii. 81), ‘masks and much more’; and from Sir Thomas Edmondes on 23\r\nDec. (Lodge, iii. 83):\r\n\r\n   ‘Both the King’s and Queen’s Majesty have a humour to have some\r\n   masks this Christmas time, and therefore, for that purpose, both\r\n   the young lords and chief gentlemen of one part, and the Queen\r\n   and her ladies of the other part, do severally undertake the\r\n   accomplishment and furnishing thereof; and, because there is\r\n   use of invention therein, special choice is made of Mr. Sanford\r\n   to direct the order and course for the ladies’;\r\n\r\nalso in the letters of Carleton to Chamberlain on 27 Nov. (Birch, i.\r\n24; _Hardwicke Papers_, i. 383), ‘many plays and shows are bespoken, to\r\ngive entertainment to our ambassadors’, and 22 Dec. (_S. P. D. Jac. I_,\r\nv. 20; Law, 9):\r\n\r\n   ‘We shall have a merry Christmas at Hampton Court, for both\r\n   male and female maskes are all ready bespoken, whereof the Duke\r\n   [of Lennox] is _rector chori_ of th’ one side and the La:\r\n   Bedford of the other.’\r\n\r\nI suppose Mr. Sanford to be Henry Sanford, who, like Daniel, had been\r\nof the Wilton household (cf. Aubrey, i. 311) and may well have lent him\r\nhis aid.\r\n\r\nThe masks of lords on 1 Jan. and of Scots on 6 Jan. are not preserved.\r\nThe latter is perhaps most memorable because Ben Jonson and his friend\r\nSir John Roe were thrust out from it by the Lord Chamberlain (cf. ch.\r\nvi). Arabella Stuart briefly told Shrewsbury on 10 Jan. that there were\r\nthree masks (Bradley, ii. 199). _Wilbraham’s Journal_ (_Camden\r\nMisc._ x), 66, records:\r\n\r\n   ‘manie plaies and daunces with swordes: one mask by English\r\n   and Scottish lords: another by the Queen’s Maiestie and eleven\r\n   more ladies of her chamber presenting giftes as goddesses.\r\n   These maskes, especialli the laste, costes 2000 or 3000^l, the\r\n   aparells: rare musick, fine songes: and in jewels most riche\r\n   20000^l, the lest to my judgment: and her Maiestie 100,000^l.\r\n   After Christmas was running at the ring by the King and 8 or\r\n   9 lordes for the honour of those goddesses and then they all\r\n   feasted together privatelie.’\r\n\r\nBut the fullest description was given by Carleton to Chamberlain on 15\r\nJan. (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, vi. 21, printed by Law, 33, 45; Sullivan, 192).\r\n\r\n   ‘On New yeares night we had a play of Robin goode-fellow\r\n   and a maske brought in by a magicien of China. There was a\r\n   heaven built at the lower end of the hall, owt of which our\r\n   magicien came downe and after he had made a long sleepy speech\r\n   to the King of the nature of the cuntry from whence he came\r\n   comparing it with owrs for strength and plenty, he sayde he had\r\n   broughte in cloudes certain Indian and China Knights to see\r\n   the magnificency of this court. And theruppon a trauers was\r\n   drawne and the maskers seen sitting in a voulty place with theyr\r\n   torchbearers and other lights which was no vnpleasing spectacle.\r\n   The maskers were brought in by two boyes and two musitiens who\r\n   began with a song and whilst that went forward they presented\r\n   themselves to the King. The first gave the King an Impresa in\r\n   a shield with a sonet in a paper to exprese his deuice and\r\n   presented a jewell of 40,000£ valew which the King is to buy of\r\n   Peter Van Lore, but that is more than euery man knew and it made\r\n   a faire shew to the French Ambassadors eye whose master would\r\n   have bin well pleased with such a maskers present but not at\r\n   that prise. The rest in theyr order deliuered theyr scutchins\r\n   with letters and there was no great stay at any of them saue\r\n   only at one who was putt to the interpretacion of his deuise. It\r\n   was a faire horse colt in a faire greene field which he meant\r\n   to be a colt of Busephalus race and had this virtu of his sire\r\n   that none could mount him but one as great at lest as Alexander.\r\n   The King made himself merry with threatening to send this colt\r\n   to the stable and he could not breake loose till he promised to\r\n   dance as well as Bankes his horse. The first measure was full\r\n   of changes and seemed confused but was well gone through with\r\n   all, and for the ordinary measures they tooke out the Queen,\r\n   the ladies of Derby, Harford, Suffolke, Bedford, Susan Vere,\r\n   Suthwell th’ elder and Rich. In the corantoes they ran over\r\n   some other of the young ladies, and so ended as they began with\r\n   a song; and that done, the magicien dissolved his enchantment,\r\n   and made the maskers appear in theyr likenes to be th’ Erle of\r\n   Pembroke, the Duke, Mons^r. d’Aubigny, yong Somerset, Philip\r\n   Harbert the young Bucephal, James Hayes, Richard Preston,\r\n   and Sir Henry Godier. Theyr attire was rich but somewhat too\r\n   heavy and cumbersome for dancers which putt them besides ther\r\n   galliardes. They had loose robes of crimsen sattin embrodered\r\n   with gold and bordered with brood siluer laces, dublets and\r\n   bases of cloth of siluer; buskins, swordes and hatts alike and\r\n   in theyr hats ech of them an Indian bird for a fether with\r\n   some jewells. The twelfe-day the French Ambassador was feasted\r\n   publikely; and at night there was a play in the Queens presence\r\n   with a masquerado of certaine Scotchmen who came in with a sword\r\n   dance not vnlike a matachin, and performed it clenly.... The\r\n   Sunday following was the great day of the Queenes maske.’\r\n\r\nThis Carleton describes at length; I only note points which supplement\r\nDaniel’s description.\r\n\r\n   ‘The Hale was so much lessened by the workes that were in it,\r\n   so as none could be admitted but men of apparance, the one end\r\n   was made into a rock and in several places the waightes placed;\r\n   in attire like savages. Through the midst from the top came a\r\n   winding stayre of breadth for three to march; and so descended\r\n   the maskers by three and three; which being all seene on the\r\n   stayres at once was the best presentacion I have at any time\r\n   seene. Theyre attire was alike, loose mantles and petticotes but\r\n   of different colors, the stuffs embrodered sattins and cloth\r\n   of gold and silver, for which they were beholding to Queen\r\n   Elizabeth’s wardrobe.... Only Pallas had a trick by herself for\r\n   her clothes were not so much below the knee, but that we might\r\n   see a woman had both feete and legs which I never knew before.’\r\n\r\nHe describes the torchbearers as pages in white satin loose gowns,\r\nalthough Daniel says they were ‘in the like several colours’ to the\r\nmaskers. The temple was ‘on the left side of the hall towards the upper\r\nend’. For the ‘common measures’ the lords taken out were Pembroke,\r\nLennox, Suffolk, Henry Howard, Southampton, Devonshire, Sidney,\r\nNottingham, Monteagle, Northumberland, Knollys, and Worcester.\r\n\r\n   ‘For galliardes and corantoes they went by discretion, and the\r\n   yong Prince was tost from hand to hand like a tennis bal. The\r\n   Lady Bedford and Lady Susan tooke owt the two ambassadors; and\r\n   they bestirred themselfe very liuely: speceally the Spaniard for\r\n   the Spanish galliard shewed himself a lusty old reueller.... But\r\n   of all for goode grace and goode footmanship Pallas bare the\r\n   bell away.’\r\n\r\nThe dancers unmasked about midnight, and then came a banquet in the\r\npresence-chamber, ‘which was dispatched with the accustomed confusion’.\r\n\r\nCarleton also mentions the trouble between the Spanish and French\r\nambassadors, which is also referred to in a letter of O. Renzo to G.\r\nA. Frederico (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, vi. 37; cf. Sullivan, 195), and is\r\nthe subject of several dispatches by and to the Comte de Beaumont\r\n(_King’s MSS._ cxxiv, ff. 328, 359^v, 363, 373, 381, 383^v, 389; cf.\r\nReyher, 519, Sullivan, 193–5). was the object of the Court not to\r\ninvite both ambassadors together, as this would entail an awkward\r\ndecision as to precedence. Beaumont was asked first, to the mask on 1\r\nJan. He hesitated to accept, expressing a fear that it was intended to\r\nask De Taxis to the Queen’s mask on Twelfth Night, ‘dernier jour des\r\nfestes de Noël selon la facon d’Angleterre et le plus honnorable de\r\ntout pour la cérémonie qui s’y obserue de tout temps publiquement’.\r\nAfter some negotiation he extracted a promise from James that, if the\r\nSpaniard was present at all, it would be in a private capacity, and he\r\nthen dropped the point, and accepted his own invitation, threatening to\r\nkill De Taxis in the presence if he dared to dispute precedence with\r\nhim. On 5 Jan. he learnt that Anne had refused to dance if De Taxis was\r\nnot present, and that the promise would be broken. He protested, and\r\nhis protest was met by an invitation for the Twelfth Night to which he\r\nhad attached such importance. But the Queen’s mask was put off until\r\n8 Jan., a Scottish mask substituted on 6 Jan., and on 8 Jan. De Taxis\r\nwas present, revelling it in red, while Anne paid him the compliment of\r\nwearing a red favour on her costume.\r\n\r\nReyher, 519, cites references to the Queen’s mask in the accounts of\r\nthe Treasurer of the Chamber and of the Office of Works. E. Law (_Hist.\r\nof Hampton Court_, ii. 10) gives, presumably from one of these, ‘making\r\nreadie the lower ende with certain roomes of the hall at Hampton Court\r\nfor the Queenes Maiestie and ladies against their mask by the space of\r\nthree dayes’.\r\n\r\nAllde’s edition must have been quickly printed. On 2 Feb. Lord\r\nWorcester wrote to Lord Shrewsbury (Lodge, iii. 87): ‘Whereas your\r\nLordship saith you were never particularly advertised of the mask, I\r\nhave been at sixpence charge with you to send you the book, which will\r\ninform you better than I can, having noted the names of the ladies\r\napplied to each goddess; and for the other, I would likewise have sent\r\nyou the ballet, if I could have got it for money, but these books, as\r\nI hear, are all called in, and in truth I will not take upon me to set\r\nthat down which wiser than myself do not understand.’\r\n\r\n                    _Tethys’ Festival. 5 June 1610_\r\n\r\n1610. Tethys Festiual: or the Queenes Wake. Celebrated at Whitehall,\r\nthe fifth day of June 1610. Deuised by Samuel Daniel, one of the\r\nGroomes of her Maiesties most Honourable priuie Chamber. _For John\r\nBudge._ [Annexed with separate title-page to _The Creation of Henry\r\nPrince of Wales_ (q.v.). A Preface to the Reader criticizes, though not\r\nby name, Ben Jonson’s descriptions of his masks.]\r\n\r\n_Edition_ in Nichols, _James_ (1828), ii. 346.\r\n\r\nThe maskers, in sky-blue and cloth of silver, were Tethys and thirteen\r\nNymphs of as many English Rivers; the antimaskers, in light robes\r\nadorned with flowers, eight Naiads; the presenters Zephyrus and two\r\nTritons, whom with the Naiads Daniel calls ‘the Ante-maske or first\r\nshew’, and Mercury. Torchbearers were dispensed with, for ‘they would\r\nhave pestered the roome, which the season would not well permit’.\r\n\r\nThe locality was probably the Banqueting Room at Whitehall. The scene\r\nwas supplemented by a Tree of Victory on a mount to the right of ‘the\r\nstate’. A ‘travers’ representing a cloud served for a curtain, and was\r\ndrawn to discover, within a framework borne on pilasters, in front\r\nof which stood Neptune and Nereus on pedestals, a haven, whence the\r\n‘Ante-maske’ issued. They presented on behalf of Tethys a trident to\r\nthe King, and a sword and scarf to Henry, and the Naiads danced round\r\nZephyrus. The scene was then changed, under cover of three circles of\r\nmoving lights and glasses, to show five niches, of which the central\r\none represented a throne for Tethys, with Thames at her feet, and the\r\nothers four caverns, each containing three Nymphs.\r\n\r\nThe maskers marched to the Tree of Victory, at which they offered their\r\nflowers, and under which Tethys reposed between the dances. Of these\r\nthey gave two; then took out the Lords for ‘measures, corantos, and\r\ngalliardes’; and then gave their ‘retyring daunce’. Apparently as an\r\ninnovation, ‘to avoid the confusion which usually attendeth the desolve\r\nof these shewes’, the presenters stayed the dissolve, and Mercury sent\r\nthe Duke of York and six young noblemen to conduct the Queen and ladies\r\nback ‘in their owne forme’.\r\n\r\nThis was a Queen’s mask, and Daniel notes ‘that there were none of\r\ninferior sort mixed among these great personages of state and honour\r\n(as usually there have been); but all was performed by themselves\r\nwith a due reservation of their dignity. The maskers were the\r\nQueen (Tethys), the Lady Elizabeth (Thames), Lady Arabella Stuart\r\n(Trent), the Countesses of Arundel (Arun), Derby (Darwent), Essex\r\n(Lee), Dorset (Air), and Montgomery (Severn), Viscountess Haddington\r\n(Rother), and the Ladies Elizabeth Gray (Medway), Elizabeth Guilford\r\n(Dulesse), Katherine Petre (Olwy), Winter (Wye), and Windsor (Usk).\r\nThe antimaskers were ‘eight little Ladies’. The Duke of York played\r\nZephyrus, and two gentlemen ‘of good worth and respect’ the Tritons.\r\n‘The artificiall part’, says Daniel, ‘only speakes Master Inago Jones.’\r\n\r\nOn 13 Jan. 1610 Chamberlain wrote to Winwood (iii. 117, misdated\r\n‘February’) that ‘the Queen would likewise have a mask against\r\nCandlemas or Shrovetide’. Doubtless it was deferred to the Creation,\r\nfor which on 24 May the same writer (Winwood, iii. 175) mentions Anne\r\nas preparing and practising a mask. Winwood’s papers (iii. 179) also\r\ncontain a description, unsigned, but believed by their editor to be\r\nwritten by John Finett, as follows:\r\n\r\n   ‘The next day was graced with a most glorious Maske, which\r\n   was double. In the first, came first in the little Duke of\r\n   Yorke between two great Sea Slaves, the cheefest of Neptune’s\r\n   servants, attended upon by twelve [eight] little Ladies, all\r\n   of them the daughters of Earls or Barons. By one of these\r\n   men a speech was made unto the King and Prince, expressing\r\n   the conceipt of the maske; by the other a sword worth 20,000\r\n   crowns at the least was put into the Duke of York’s hands,\r\n   who presented the same unto the Prince his brother from the\r\n   first of those ladies which were to follow in the next maske.\r\n   This done, the Duke returned into his former place in midst\r\n   of the stage, and the little ladies performed their dance to\r\n   the amazement of all the beholders, considering the tenderness\r\n   of their years and the many intricate changes of the dance;\r\n   which was so disposed, that which way soever the changes went\r\n   the little Duke was still found to be in the midst of these\r\n   little dancers. These light skirmishers having done their\r\n   _devoir_, in came the Princesses; first the Queen, next the\r\n   Lady Elizabeth’s Grace, then the Lady Arbella, the Countesses\r\n   of Arundell, Derby, Essex, Dorset, and Montgomery, the Lady\r\n   Hadington, the Lady Elizabeth Grey, the Lady Windsor, the Lady\r\n   Katherine Peter, the Lady Elizabeth Guilford, and the Lady Mary\r\n   [Anne] Wintour. By that time these had done, it was high time\r\n   to go to bed, for it was within half an hour of the sun’s, not\r\n   setting, but rising. Howbeit, a farther time was to be spent in\r\n   viewing and scrambling at one of the most magnificent banquets\r\n   that I have seen. The ambassadors of Spaine, of Venice, and of\r\n   the Low Countries were present at this and all the rest of these\r\n   glorious sights, and in truth so they were.’\r\n\r\nBrief notices in Stowe’s _Annales_ (902, paged 907 in error) and in\r\nletters by Carleton to Sir Thomas Edmondes (Birch, i. 114) and by\r\nJohn Noies to his wife (_Hist. MSS. Various Colls._ iii. 261) add\r\nnothing to Finett’s account. There were no very serious ambassadorial\r\ncomplications, as the death of Henri IV put an invitation to the\r\nFrench ambassador out of the question (cf. Sullivan, 59). Correr notes\r\nwith satisfaction that, as ambassador from Venice, he had as good\r\na box as that of the Spanish ambassador, while, to please Spanish\r\nsusceptibilities, that of the Dutch ambassador was less good (_V. P._\r\nxi. 507).\r\n\r\nThe mask was ‘excessively costly’ (_V. P._ xii. 86). Several financial\r\ndocuments relating to it are on record (Reyher, 507, 521; Devon, 105,\r\n127; Sullivan, 219, 221; _S. P. D. Jac. I_, liii. 4, 74; lix. 12),\r\nincluding a warrant of 4 March, which recites the Queen’s pleasure that\r\nthe Lord Chamberlain and Master of the Horse ‘shall take some paines\r\nto look into the emptions and provisions of all things necessarie’,\r\nanother of 25 May for an imprest to Inigo Jones, an embroiderer’s\r\nbill for £55, and a silkman’s for £1,071 5_s._, with an endorsement\r\nby Lord Knyvet, referring the prices to the Privy Council, and\r\ncounter-signatures by the Lord Chamberlain and the Master of the Horse.\r\nIn this case the dresses of the maskers seem to have been provided\r\nfor them. An allusion in a letter of Donne to Sir Henry Goodyere\r\n(_Letters_, i. 240) makes a sportive suggestion for a source of revenue\r\n‘if Mr. Inago Jones be not satisfied for his last masque (because I\r\nhear say it cannot come to much)’.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DAVIDSON (1549?-1603).\r\n\r\nA Regent of St. Leonard’s College, St. Andrew’s, and afterwards\r\nminister of Liberton and a bitter satirist on behalf of the extreme\r\nKirk party in Scotland.\r\n\r\n                 _The Siege of Edinburgh Castle. 1571_\r\n\r\nJames Melville writes s.a. 1571: ‘This yeir in the monethe of July,\r\nMr. Jhone Davidsone an of our Regents maid a play at the mariage of\r\nMr. Jhone Coluin, quhilk I saw playit in Mr. Knox presence, wherin,\r\naccording to Mr. Knox doctrine, the castell of Edinbruche was besiged,\r\ntakin, and the Captan, with an or two with him, hangit in effigie.’[656]\r\n\r\nThis was in intelligent anticipation of events. Edinburgh Castle was\r\nheld by Kirkcaldy of Grange for Mary in 1571. On 28 May 1573 it was\r\ntaken by the English on behalf of the party of James VI, and Kirkcaldy\r\nwas hanged.\r\n\r\nMelville also records plays at the ‘Bachelor Act’ of 1573 at St.\r\nAndrews.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN DAVIES (1569–1626).\r\n\r\nDavies was a Winchester and Queen’s College, Oxford, man, who\r\nentered the Middle Temple on 3 Feb. 1588, served successively as\r\nSolicitor-General (1603–6) and Attorney-General (1606–19) in Ireland,\r\nand was Speaker of the Irish Parliament in 1613. His principal poems\r\nare _Orchestra_ (1594) and _Nosce Teipsum_ (1599). He was invited by\r\nthe Earl of Cumberland (q.v.) to write verses for ‘barriers’ in 1601,\r\nand contributed to the entertainments of Elizabeth by Sir Thomas\r\nEgerton (cf. ch. xxiv) and Sir Robert Cecil (q.v.) in 1602.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n_Works_ by A.

H.\r\nBullen (1890–1). He entered Gray’s Inn in 1593: for his contribution to\r\nthe Gray’s Inn mask of 1595, see s.v. ANON. _Gesta Grayorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DAY (_c._ 1574–_c._ 1640).\r\n\r\nDay was described as son of Walter Dey, husbandman, of Cawston,\r\nNorfolk, when at the age of eighteen he became a sizar of Gonville\r\nand Caius, Cambridge, on 24 Oct. 1592; on 4 May 1593 he was expelled\r\nfor stealing a book (Venn, _Caius_, i. 146). He next appears in\r\nHenslowe’s diary, first as selling an old play for the Admiral’s in\r\nJuly 1598, and then as writing busily for that company in 1599–1603\r\nand for Worcester’s in 1602–3. Most of this work was in collaboration,\r\noccasionally with Dekker, frequently with Chettle, Hathway, Haughton,\r\nor Smith. From this period little or nothing survives except _The Blind\r\nBeggar of Bethnal Green_. Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, 126, doubts whether\r\nan acrostic on Thomas Downton signed ‘John Daye’, contributed by J.\r\nF. Herbert to _Sh. Soc. Papers_, i. 19, and now at Dulwich, is to be\r\nascribed to the dramatist. Day’s independent plays, written about\r\n1604–8, and his _Parliament of Bees_ are of finer literary quality\r\nthan this early record would suggest. But Ben Jonson classed him to\r\nDrummond in 1619 amongst the ‘rogues’ and ‘base fellows’ who were ‘not\r\nof the number of the faithfull, i.e. Poets’ (Laing, 4, 11). He must\r\nhave lived long, as John Tatham, who included an elegy on him as his\r\n‘loving friend’ in his _Fancies Theater_ (1640), was then only about\r\ntwenty-eight. He appears to have been still writing plays in 1623, but\r\nthere is no trace of any substantial body of work after 1608. Fleay, i.\r\n115, suggests from the tone of his manuscript pamphlet _Peregrinatio\r\nScholastica_ that he took orders.\r\n\r\n                             _Collection_\r\n\r\n1881. A. H.

T._).\r\n\r\nThe Prince’s men of the title are probably the later Prince Charles’s\r\n(1631–41), but these were the ultimate successors of Prince Henry’s,\r\nformerly the Admiral’s, who produced, between May 1600 and Sept. 1601,\r\nthree parts of a play called indifferently by Henslowe _The Blind\r\nBeggar of Bethnal Green_ and _Thomas Strowd_. Payments were made for\r\nthe first part to Day and Chettle and for the other two to Day and\r\nHaughton. On the assumption that the extant play is Part i, Bullen,\r\n_Introd._ 8 and Fleay, i. 107, make divergent suggestions as to the\r\ndivision of responsibility between Day and Chettle. At l. 2177 is the\r\ns.d. ‘Enter Captain Westford, Sill Clark’; probably the performance in\r\nwhich this actor took part was a Caroline one.\r\n\r\n          _Law Tricks, or Who Would Have Thought It. 1604_\r\n\r\n_S.

But I think the original production must have been in 1604,\r\nas the dispute between Westminster and Winchester for ‘terms’, in which\r\nWinchester is said to have been successful, ‘on Saint Lukes day, coming\r\nshalbe a twelue-month’ (ed. Bullen, p. 61) can only refer to the term\r\nheld at Winchester in 1603. An inundation in July is also mentioned (p.\r\n61), and Stowe, _Annales_ (1615), 844, has a corresponding record for\r\n1604, but gives the day as 3 Aug.\r\n\r\n                      _The Isle of Gulls. 1606_\r\n\r\n1606.

Nevertheless, Damoetas, the royal favourite, ‘a little\r\nhillock made great with others ruines’ (p. 13) inevitably suggests\r\nSir Robert Carr, and Fleay, i. 109, points out that the ‘Duke’ and\r\n‘Duchess’ of the dramatis personae have been substituted for a ‘King’\r\nand ‘Queen’. It may not be possible now to verify all the men whose\r\n‘parts’ were acted; evidently the Arcadians and Lacedaemonians stand\r\nfor the two ‘nations’ of English and Scotch. I do not see any ground\r\nfor Fleay’s attempt to treat the play, not as a political, but as\r\na literary satire, identifying Damoetas with Daniel, and tracing\r\nallusions to Jonson, Marston, and Chapman in the Induction. Hoby’s\r\nindication of date is confirmed by references to the ‘Eastward,\r\nWestward or Northward hoe’ (p. 3; cf. s.vv. Chapman, Dekker), to the\r\nquartering for treason on 30 Jan. 1606 (pp. 3, 51), and conceivably to\r\nJonson’s _Volpone_ of 1605 or early 1606 (p. 88, ‘you wil ha my humor\r\nbrought ath stage for a vserer’).\r\n\r\n            _The Travels of Three English Brothers. 1607_\r\n\r\n_S.

Nixon (S. R. 8 June\r\n1607) and the play seems to have been still on the stage when it\r\nwas printed. Some suggestions as to the division of authorship are\r\nin Fleay, ii. 277, Bullen, _Introd._ 19, and C. W. Stork, _William\r\nRowley_, 57. A scene at Venice (Bullen, p. 55) introduces Will Kempe,\r\nwho mentions Vennar’s _England’s Joy_ (1602), and prepares to play an\r\n‘extemporall merriment’ with an Italian Harlaken. He has come from\r\nEngland with a boy. The Epilogue refers to ‘some that fill up this\r\nround circumference’.\r\n\r\n                   _Humour out of Breath. 1607–8_\r\n\r\n_S.

Halliwell (1860), A. Symons in _Nero and Other\r\nPlays_ (1888, _Mermaid Series_).\r\n\r\nThe date must be taken as 1607–8, since the King’s Revels are not\r\ntraceable before 1607. Fleay, i. 111, notes a reference in iii. 4 to\r\nthe ‘great frost’ of that Christmas. The Epistle speaks of the play\r\nas ‘sufficiently featur’d too, had it been all of one man’s getting’,\r\nwhich may be a hint of divided authorship.\r\n\r\n                _The Parliament of Bees. 1608 < > 16_\r\n\r\n[_MS._] _Lansdowne MS._ 725, with title. ‘An olde manuscript conteyning\r\nthe Parliament of Bees, found in a Hollow Tree in a garden at Hibla, in\r\na Strange Languadge, And now faithfully Translated into Easie English\r\nVerse by John Daye, Cantabridg.’ [Epistles to William Augustine, signed\r\n‘John Day, Cant.’ and to the Reader, signed ‘Jo: Daye’.]\r\n\r\n_S.

The text varies considerably from that of the\r\nmanuscript.]\r\n\r\n_Edition_ by A. Symons in _Nero and Other Plays_ (1888, _Mermaid\r\nSeries_).\r\n\r\nThis is neither a play nor a mask, but a set of twelve short\r\n‘Characters’ or ‘Colloquies’ in dialogue. The existence of an edition\r\nof 1607 is asserted in Gildon’s abridgement (1699) of Langbaine, but\r\ncannot be verified, and is most improbable, since the manuscript\r\nEpistle refers to an earlier work already dedicated by Day, as ‘an\r\nunknowing venturer’, to Augustine, and this must surely be the\r\nallegorical treatise _Peregrinatio Scholastica_ printed by Bullen\r\n(_Introd._ 35) from _Sloane MS._ 3150 with an Epistle by Day to William\r\nAustin, who may reasonably be identified with Augustine. But the\r\n_Peregrinatio_, although Day’s first venture in dedication, was not a\r\nvery early work, for Day admits that ‘I boast not that gaudie spring\r\nof credit and youthfull florish of opinion as some other filde in the\r\nsame rancke with me’. Moreover, it describes (p. 50) an ‘ante-maske’,\r\nand this term, so far as we know, first came into use about 1608 (cf.\r\nch. vi). The _Bees_ therefore must be later still. On the other hand,\r\nit can hardly be later than about 1616, when died Philip Henslowe, whom\r\nit is impossible to resist seeing with Fleay, i. 115, in the Fenerator\r\nor Usuring Bee (p. 63). Like Henslowe he is a ‘broaker’ and ‘takes up’\r\nclothes; and\r\n\r\n    Most of the timber that his state repairs,\r\n    He hew’s out o’ the bones of foundred players:\r\n    They feed on Poets braines, he eats their breath.\r\n\r\nNow of the twelve Characters of the _Bees_, five (2, 3, 7, 8, 9) are\r\nreproduced, in many parts verbatim, subject to an alteration of names,\r\nin _The Wonder of a Kingdom_, printed as Dekker’s (q.v.) in 1636,\r\nbut probably identical with _Come See a Wonder_, licensed by Herbert\r\nas Day’s in 1623. Two others (4, 5) are similarly reproduced in _The\r\nNoble Soldier_, printed in 1634 under the initials ‘S. R.’, probably\r\nindicating Samuel Rowley, but possibly also containing work by Dekker.\r\nThe precise relation of Day to these plays is indeterminate, but the\r\nscenes more obviously ‘belong’ to the _Bees_ than to the plays, and if\r\nthe _Bees_ was written but not printed in 1608–16, the chances are that\r\nDay used it as a quarry of material when he was called upon to work,\r\nas reviser or collaborator, on the plays. Meanwhile, Austin, if he\r\nwas the Southwark and Lincoln’s Inn writer of that name (_D. N. B._),\r\ndied in 1634, and when the _Bees_ was ultimately printed in 1641 a new\r\ndedicatee had to be found.\r\n\r\n                       _Lost and Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nFor the Admiral’s, 1598–1603.\r\n\r\nDay appears to have sold the company an old play _1 The Conquest\r\nof Brute_ in July 1598, and to have subsequently written or\r\ncollaborated in the following plays:\r\n\r\n1599–1600: _Cox of Collumpton_, with Haughton; _Thomas Merry_, or\r\n_Beech’s Tragedy_, with Haughton; _The Seven Wise Masters_, with\r\nChettle, Dekker, and Haughton; _Cupid and Psyche_, with Chettle and\r\nDekker; _1 Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green_, with Chettle; and the\r\nunfinished _Spanish Moor’s Tragedy_, with Dekker and Haughton.\r\n\r\n1600–1: _2 Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green_, with Haughton; _Six Yeomen\r\nof the West_, with Haughton.\r\n\r\n1601–2: _The Conquest of the West Indies_, with Haughton and Smith;\r\n_3 Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green_, with Haughton; _Friar Rush and\r\nThe Proud Woman of Antwerp_, with Chettle and Haughton; _The Bristol\r\nTragedy_; and the unfinished _2 Tom Dough_, with Haughton.\r\n\r\n1602–3: _Merry as May Be_, with Hathway and Smith; _The Boss of\r\nBillingsgate_, with Hathway and another.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Worcester’s men.\r\n\r\n1602–3: _1 and 2 The Black Dog of Newgate_, with Hathway, Smith, and\r\nanother; _The Unfortunate General_, with Hathway, Smith, and a third;\r\nand the unfinished _Shore_, with Chettle.\r\n\r\nOf the above only _The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green_ and a note\r\nof _Cox of Collumpton_ (cf. ch. xiii, s.v. Admiral’s) survive; for\r\nspeculations as to others see Heywood, _Pleasant Dialogues and Dramas_\r\n(_Cupid and Psyche_), Marlowe, _Lust’s Dominion_ (_Spanish Moor’s\r\nTragedy_), Yarington, _Two Lamentable Tragedies_ (_Thomas Merry_),\r\nand the anonymous _Edward IV_ (_Shore_) and _Fair Maid of Bristol_\r\n(_Bristow Tragedy_).\r\n\r\nHenslowe’s correspondence (_Henslowe Papers_, 56, 127) contains notes\r\nfrom Day and others about some of the Admiral’s plays and a few lines\r\nwhich may be from _The Conquest of the Indies_.\r\n\r\nDay’s _Mad Pranks of Merry Mall of the Bankside_ (S. R. 7 Aug. 1610)\r\nwas probably a pamphlet (cf. Dekker, _The Roaring Girl_). Bullen,\r\n_Introd._ 11, thinks the _Guy Earl of Warwick_ (1661), printed as\r\n‘by B. J.’, too bad to be Day and Dekker’s _Life and Death of Guy of\r\nWarwick_ (S. R. 15 Jan. 1620). On 30 July 1623 Herbert licensed a\r\n_Bellman of Paris_ by Day and Dekker for the Prince’s (Herbert, 24).\r\n_The Maiden’s Holiday_ by Marlowe (q.v.) and Day (S. R. 8 April 1654)\r\nappears in Warburton’s list of burnt plays (_3 Library_, ii. 231) as\r\nMarlowe’s.\r\n\r\nFor other ascriptions to Day see _The Maid’s Metamorphosis_ and\r\n_Parnassus_ in ch. xxiv.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DEKKER (_c._ 1572–_c._ 1632).\r\n\r\nThomas Dekker was of London origin, but though the name occurs in\r\nSouthwark, Cripplegate, and Bishopsgate records, neither his parentage\r\nnor his marriage, if he was married, can be definitely traced. He\r\nwas not unlettered, but nothing is known of his education, and the\r\nconjecture that he trailed a pike in the Netherlands is merely based\r\non his acquaintance with war and with Dutch. The Epistle to his\r\n_English Villanies_, with its reference to ‘my three score years’,\r\nfirst appeared in the edition of 1632; he was therefore born about\r\n1572. He first emerges, in Henslowe’s diary, as a playwright for\r\nthe Admiral’s in 1598, and may very well have been working for them\r\nduring 1594–8, a period for which Henslowe records plays only and\r\nnot authors. The further conjecture of Fleay, i. 119, that this\r\nemployment went as far back as 1588–91 is hazardous, and in fact led\r\nFleay to put his birth-date as far back as 1567. It was based on the\r\nfact that the German repertories of 1620 and 1626 contain traces of\r\nhis work, and on Fleay’s erroneous belief (cf. ch. xiv) that all the\r\nplays in these repertories were taken to Germany by Robert Browne as\r\nearly as 1592. But it is smiled upon by Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 256)\r\nas regards _The Virgin Martyr_ alone. Between 1598 and 1602 Dekker\r\nwrote busily, and as a rule in collaboration, first for the Admiral’s\r\nat the Rose and Fortune, and afterwards for Worcester’s at the Rose.\r\nHe had a hand in some forty-four plays, of which, in anything like\r\ntheir original form, only half a dozen survive. _Satiromastix_,\r\nwritten for the Chamberlain’s men and the Paul’s boys in 1601, shows\r\nthat his activities were not limited to the Henslowe companies.\r\nThis intervention in the _Poetomachia_ led Jonson to portray him\r\nas Demetrius Fannius ‘the dresser of plays’ in _The Poetaster_;\r\nthat he is also Thersites in _Troilus and Cressida_ is a not very\r\nplausible conjecture. Long after, in 1619, Jonson classed him among\r\nthe ‘rogues’ (Laing, 4). In 1604, however, he shared with Jonson the\r\nresponsibility for the London devices at James’s coronation entry.\r\nAbout this time began his career as a writer of popular pamphlets, in\r\nwhich he proved the most effective successor of Thomas Nashe. These,\r\nand in particular _The Gull’s Hornbook_ (1609), are full of touches\r\ndrawn from his experience as a dramatist. Nor did he wholly desert the\r\nstage, collaborating with Middleton for the Prince’s and with Webster\r\nfor Paul’s, and writing also, apparently alone, for the Queen’s. In\r\n1612 he devised the Lord Mayor’s pageant. In 1613 he fell upon evil\r\ndays. He had always been impecunious, and Henslowe (i. 83, 101, 161)\r\nhad lent him money to discharge him from the Counter in 1598 and from\r\nan arrest by the Chamberlain’s in 1599. Now he fell into the King’s\r\nBench for debt, and apparently lay there until 1619. The relationship\r\nof his later work to that of Ford, Massinger, Day, and others, lies\r\nrather beyond the scope of this inquiry, but in view of the persistent\r\nattempts to find early elements in all his plays, I have made my list\r\ncomprehensive. He is not traceable after 1632, and is probably the\r\nThomas Decker, householder, buried at St. James’s, Clerkenwell, on 25\r\nAug. 1632. A Clerkenwell recusant of this name is recorded in 1626 and\r\n1628 (_Middlesex County Records_, iii. 12, 19).\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1873. [R. H.

Smeaton (1904, _T. D._).\r\n\r\nThe Admiral’s revived, from 3 Feb. to 26 May 1596, ‘the 1 parte of\r\nForteunatus’. Nothing is heard of a second part, but during 9–30 Nov.\r\n1599 Dekker received £6 on account of the Admiral’s for ‘the hole\r\nhistory of Fortunatus’, followed on 1 Dec. by £1 for altering the book\r\nand on 12 Dec. £2 ‘for the eande of Fortewnatus for the corte’. The\r\ncompany were at Court on 27 Dec. 1599 and 1 Jan. 1600. _The Shoemaker’s\r\nHoliday_ was played on 1 Jan.; _Fortunatus_ therefore on 27 Dec. The\r\nPrologue (l. 21) makes it ‘a iust yeere’ since the speaker saw the\r\nQueen, presumably on 27 Dec. 1598. The S. R. entry suggests that the\r\n1599 play was a revision of the 1596 one. Probably Dekker boiled the\r\nold two parts down into one play; the juncture may, as suggested by\r\nFleay, i. 126, and Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 179), come about l. 1315.\r\nThe Court additions clearly include, besides the Prologue and the\r\nEpilogue with its reference to Elizabeth’s forty-second regnal year\r\n(1599–1600), the compliment of ll. 2799–834 at the ‘eande’ of the play.\r\nThe ‘small circumference’ of the theatrical prologue was doubtless\r\nthe Rose. Dekker may or may not have been the original author of the\r\ntwo-part play; probably he was not, if Fleay is right in assigning\r\nit to _c._ 1590 on the strength of the allusions to the Marprelate\r\ncontroversy left in the 1600 text, e.g. l. 59. I should not wonder if\r\nGreene, who called his son Fortunatus, were the original author. A\r\nFortunatus play is traceable in German repertories of 1608 and 1626\r\nand an extant version in the collection of 1620 owes something to\r\nDekker’s (Herz, 97; cf. P. Harms, _Die deutschen Fortunatus-Dramen_\r\nin _Theatergeschichtliche Forschungen_, v). But Dekker’s own source,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, was a German folk-tale, which had been\r\ndramatized by Hans Sachs as early as 1553.\r\n\r\n                   _The Shoemaker’s Holiday. 1599_\r\n\r\n_S.

Probably the hiatus in the Diary conceals\r\nother payments for the play, and there is nothing in the form of the\r\nentry to justify the suspicions of Fleay, i. 124, that it was not new\r\nand was not by Dekker himself. Moreover, the source was a prose tract\r\nof _The Gentle Craft_ by T. D[eloney], published in 1598. The Admiral’s\r\nwere at Court on 1 Jan. 1600, but not on 1 Jan. 1601. A writer signing\r\nhimself Dramaticus, in _Sh. Soc. Papers_, iv. 110, describes a copy in\r\nwhich a contemporary hand has written the names ‘T. Dekker, R. Wilson’\r\nat the end of the Epistle, together with the names of the actors in the\r\nmargin of the text. A few of these are not otherwise traceable in the\r\nAdmiral’s. Fleay and Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 203) unite in condemning\r\nthis communication as an obvious forgery; but I rather wish they had\r\ngiven their reasons.\r\n\r\n                      _Patient Grissell. 1600_\r\n\r\n                     _With_ Chettle and Haughton.\r\n\r\n_S.

Westenholz, _Die Griseldis-Sage in der\r\nLiteraturgeschichte_ (1888).\r\n\r\nHenslowe paid £10 10_s._ to Dekker, Chettle, and Haughton for the\r\nplay between 16 Oct. and 29 Dec. 1599, also £1 for Grissell’s gown\r\non 26 Jan. 1600 and £2 ‘to staye the printing’ on 18 March 1600. The\r\ntext refers to ‘wonders of 1599’ (l. 2220) and to ‘this yeare’ as\r\n‘leap yeare’ (l. 157). The production was doubtless _c._ Feb.–March\r\n1600. Fleay, i. 271, attempts to divide the work amongst the three\r\ncontributors; cf. Hunt, 60. I see nothing to commend the theory of\r\nW. Bang (_E. S._ xxviii. 208) that the play was written by Chettle\r\n_c._ 1590–4 and revised with Dekker, Haughton, and Jonson. No doubt\r\nthe dandy’s duel, in which clothes alone suffer, of Emulo-Sir Owen\r\nresembles that of Brisk-Luculento in _Every Man Out of his Humour_,\r\nbut this may be due to a common origin in fact (cf. Fleay, i. 361;\r\nPenniman, _War_, 70; Small, 43). Fleay, followed by Penniman,\r\nidentifies Emulo with Samuel Daniel, but Small, 42, 184, satisfactorily\r\ndisposes of this suggestion. There seems no reason to regard _Patient\r\nGrissell_ as part of the _Poetomachia_. A ‘Comoedia von der Crysella’\r\nis in the German repertory of 1626; the theme had, however, already\r\nbeen dealt with in a play of _Griseldis_ by Hans Sachs (Herz, 66, 78).\r\n\r\n                        _Satiromastix. 1601_\r\n\r\n                            _With_ Marston?\r\n\r\n_S.

R._ vi. 398 regards these as only\r\nvariant states of one edition.]\r\n\r\n_Editions_ by T. Hawkins (1773, _O. E. D._ iii), H. Scherer (1907,\r\n_Materialien_, xx), J. H. Penniman (1913, _B. L._).\r\n\r\nThe Epistle refers to the _Poetomachia_ between ‘Horace’ and ‘a band\r\nof leane-witted Poetasters’, and on the place of _Satiromastix_\r\nin this fray there is little to be added to Small, 119. Jonson is\r\nsatirized as Horace. Asinius Bubo is some unknown satellite of his,\r\nprobably the same who appears as Simplicius Faber in Marston’s _What\r\nYou Will_ (q.v.). Crispinus, Demetrius, and Tucca are taken over from\r\nJonson’s _Poetaster_ (q.v.). The satirical matter is engrafted on to\r\na play with a tragic plot and comic sub-plot, both wholly unconcerned\r\nwith the _Poetomachia_. Jonson must have known that the attack was\r\nin preparation, when he made Tucca abuse Histrio for threatening to\r\n‘play’ him, and Histrio say that he had hired Demetrius [Dekker] ‘to\r\nabuse Horace, and bring him in, in a play’ (_Poetaster_, III. iv.\r\n212, 339). But obviously Dekker cannot have done much of his satire\r\nuntil he had seen _Poetaster_, to many details of which it retorts.\r\nIt is perhaps rather fantastic to hold that, as he chaffs Jonson for\r\nthe boast that he wrote _Poetaster_ in fifteen weeks (_Satiromastix_,\r\n641), he must himself have taken less. In any case a date of production\r\nbetween that of _Poetaster_ in the spring of 1601 and the S. R. entry\r\non 11 Nov. 1601 is indicated. The argument of Scherer, x, for a date\r\nabout Christmas 1601, and therefore after the S. R. entry, is rebutted\r\nby Parrott. It is generally held that Marston helped Dekker with the\r\nplay, in spite of the single name on the title-page. No doubt Tucca\r\nin _Poetaster_, III. iv. 352, suggests to Histrio that Crispinus\r\nshall help Demetrius, and the plural is used in _Satiromastix_\r\n(_Epistle_, 12, and _Epilogue_, 2700) and in Jonson’s own _Apologetical\r\nDialogue_ to _Poetaster_ (l. 141) of the ‘poetasters’ who were\r\nJonson’s ‘untrussers’. Small, 122, finds Marston in the plot and\r\ncharacterization, but not in the style.\r\n\r\n                      _Sir Thomas Wyatt. 1602_\r\n\r\n       _With_ Webster, and possibly Chettle, Heywood, and Smith.\r\n\r\n1607.

T._) and\r\nwith _Works_ of Webster (q.v.).\r\n\r\nHenslowe, on behalf of Worcester’s men, paid Chettle, Dekker, Heywood,\r\nSmith, and Webster, for _1 Lady Jane_ in Oct. 1602. He then bought\r\nproperties for _The Overthrow of Rebels_, almost certainly the same\r\nplay, and began to pay Dekker for a _2 Lady Jane_, which apparently\r\nremained unfinished, at any rate at the time. One or both of these\r\nplays, or possibly only the shares of Dekker and Webster in one or both\r\nof them, may reasonably be taken to survive in _Sir Thomas Wyatt_.\r\nStoll, 49, thinks the play, as we have it, is practically Dekker’s and\r\nthat there is ‘no one thing’ that can be claimed ‘with any degree of\r\nassurance’ for Webster. But this is not the general view. Fleay, ii.\r\n269, followed in the main by Hunt, 76, gives Webster scc. i-ix, Greg\r\n(_Henslowe_, ii. 233) scc. i-x and xvi (with hesitation as to iii-v),\r\nPierce, after a careful application of a number of ‘tests’ bearing both\r\non style and on matter, scc. ii, v, vi, x, xiv, xvi; but he thinks that\r\nsome or all of these were retouched by Dekker. Brooke inclines to trace\r\nWebster in scc. ii, xvi, Heywood in scc. vi, x, and a good deal of\r\nDekker. Hunt thinks the planning due to Chettle.\r\n\r\n                  _The Honest Whore. 1604, c. 1605_\r\n\r\n                           _With_ Middleton.\r\n\r\n_S.

D._).\r\n\r\nHenslowe made a payment to Dekker and Middleton for ‘the pasyent man\r\n& the onest hore’ between 1 Jan. and 14 March 1604, on account of the\r\nPrince’s men, and the mention of Towne in a stage-direction to Part i\r\n(ed. Pearson, ii. 78) shows that it was in fact acted by this company.\r\nFleay, i. 132, and Hunt, 94, cite some allusions in Part ii suggesting\r\na date soon after that of Part i, and this would be consistent with\r\nHenslowian methods. There is more difference of opinion about the\r\npartition of the work. Of Part i Fleay gives scc. i, iii, and xiii-xv\r\nalone to Dekker, and Hunt finds the influence of Middleton in the theme\r\nand plot of both Parts. Bullen, however (_Middleton_, i. xxv), thinks\r\nMiddleton’s share ‘inconsiderable’, giving him only I. v and III. i,\r\nwith a hand in II. i and in a few comic scenes of Part ii. Ward, ii.\r\n462, holds a similar view.\r\n\r\n                         _Westward Ho! 1604_\r\n\r\n                            _With_ Webster.\r\n\r\n_S.

Fleay assigns Acts I-III\r\nand a part of IV. ii to Webster; the rest of Acts IV, V to Dekker. But\r\nStoll, 79, thinks that Webster only had ‘some slight, undetermined part\r\nin the more colourless and stereotyped portions ... under the shaping\r\nand guiding hand of Dekker’, and Pierce, 131, after an elaborate\r\napplication of tests, can only give him all or most of I. i and III.\r\niii and a small part of I. ii and III. ii. Brooke finds traces of\r\nWebster in I. i and III. iii and Dekker in II. i, ii and V. iii, and\r\nhas some useful criticism of the ‘tests’ employed by Pierce.\r\n\r\n                        _Northward Ho! 1605_\r\n\r\n                            _With_ Webster.\r\n\r\n_S.

By\r\nThomas Decker, and Iohn Webster. _G. Eld._\r\n\r\n_Editions_ by J. S. Farmer (1914, _S. F. T._) and in _Works_ of Webster\r\n(q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe play is a reply to _Eastward Ho!_ which was itself a reply to\r\n_Westward Ho!_ and was on the stage before May 1605, and it is referred\r\nto with the other two plays in Day’s _Isle of Gulls_, which was on\r\nthe stage in Feb. 1606. This pretty well fixes its date to the end\r\nof 1605. I do not think that Stoll, 16, is justified in his argument\r\nfor a date later than Jan. 1606, since, even if the comparison of the\r\nlife of a gallant to a squib is a borrowing from Marston’s _Fawn_, it\r\nseems probable that the _Fawn_ itself was originally written by 1604,\r\nalthough possibly touched up early in 1606. Fleay, ii. 270, identifies\r\nBellamont with Chapman, one of the authors of _Eastward Ho!_ and Stoll,\r\n65, argues in support of this. It is plausible, but does not carry with\r\nit Fleay’s identification of Jenkins with Drayton. Fleay gives Webster\r\nI. ii, II. i, III. i, and IV. i, but Stoll finds as little of him as in\r\n_Westward Ho!_ and Pierce, 131, only gives him all or most of I. i, II.\r\nii, and the beginning of v and a small part of III. i. Brooke traces\r\nWebster in I. i and III. i and Dekker in IV. i.\r\n\r\n                   _The Whore of Babylon 1605 < > 7_\r\n\r\n_S.

Butter._ [Epistle to the Reader and\r\nPrologue.]\r\n\r\nFleay, i. 133, and Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 210) regard the play as a\r\nrevision of _Truth’s Supplication to Candlelight_, for which Henslowe,\r\non behalf of the Admiral’s, was paying Dekker in Jan. 1600 and buying\r\na robe for Time in April 1600. Truth and Time, but not Candlelight,\r\nare characters in the play, which deals with Catholic intrigues\r\nagainst Elizabeth, represented as Titania, and her suitors. I do not\r\nfeel sure that it would have been allowed to be staged in Elizabeth’s\r\nlifetime. In any case it must have been revised _c._ 1605–7, in view of\r\nthe references, not only to the death of Essex (ed. Pearson, p. 246)\r\nand the reign of James (p. 234), but to the _Isle of Gulls_ of 1605\r\n(p. 214). The Cockpit, alluded to (p. 214) as a place where follies\r\nare shown in apes, is of course that in the palace, where Henry saw\r\nplays. The Epistle and Prologue have clear references to a production\r\nin ‘Fortune’s dial’ and the ‘square’ of the Fortune, and the former\r\ncriticizes players; but hardly proves the definite breach with the\r\nPrince’s suggested by Fleay and Greg.\r\n\r\n                      _The Roaring Girl. c. 1610_\r\n\r\n                           _With_ Middleton.\r\n\r\n1611.

Bullen (1885,\r\n_Middleton_, iv. 1), and J. S. Farmer (1914, _S. F. T._).\r\n\r\nFleay, i, 132, thinks the play written about 1604–5, but not produced\r\nuntil 1610. This is fantastic and Bullen points out that Mary Frith,\r\nthe heroine, born not earlier than _c._ 1584–5, had hardly won her\r\nnotoriety by 1604. By 1610 she certainly had, and the ‘foule’ book of\r\nher ‘base trickes’ referred to in the Epilogue was probably John Day’s\r\n_Mad Pranks of Merry Mall of the Bankside_, entered on S. R. 7 Aug.\r\n1610, but not extant. The Epilogue also tells the audience that, if\r\nthey are dissatisfied,\r\n\r\n    The Roring Girle her selfe some few dayes hence,\r\n    Shall on this Stage, give larger recompence.\r\n\r\nI think this can only refer to a contemplated personal appearance\r\nof Mary Frith on the stage; it has been interpreted as referring to\r\nanother forthcoming play. Moll Cutpurse appears in Field’s _Amends for\r\nLadies_, but this was not a Fortune play. Bullen (_Middleton_, i. xxxv)\r\nregards the play as an example of collaboration, and gives Dekker I.\r\nII. ii, and V; Middleton, with occasional hesitation, the rest. Fleay,\r\ni. 132, only gives Middleton II. ii, IV. i, V. ii.\r\n\r\n         _If It be not Good, the Devil is in It. 1610 < > 12_\r\n\r\n1612. If It Be Not Good, the Diuel is in it.

The running title is ‘If this be not a good Play, the\r\nDiuell is in it’.]\r\n\r\nThe Epistle tells us that after ‘Fortune’ (the Admiral’s) had ‘set her\r\nfoote vpon’ the play, the Queen’s had ‘raised it up ... the Frontispice\r\nonely a little more garnished’. Fleay, i. 133, attempts to fix the\r\nplay to 1610, but hardly proves more than that it cannot be earlier\r\nthan 14 May 1610, as the murder on that day of Henri IV is referred to\r\n(ed. Pearson, p. 354). The Epistle also refers to a coming new play by\r\nDekker’s ‘worthy friend’, perhaps Webster (q.v.). In the opening scene\r\nthe devil Lurchall is addressed as Grumball, which suggests the actor\r\nArmin (cf. ch. xv). Daborne (q.v.) in the Epistle to his _Christian\r\nTurned Turk_ seems to claim a share in this play.\r\n\r\n                       _Match Me in London_ (?)\r\n\r\n_S. R._ 1630, 8 Nov. (Herbert). ‘A Play called Mach mee in London by\r\nThomas Decker.’ _Seile_ (Arber, iv. 242).\r\n\r\n1631. A Tragi-Comedy: Called, Match mee in London. As it hath beene\r\noften presented; First, at the Bull in St. Iohns-street; And lately,\r\nat the Priuate-House in Drury Lane, called the Phoenix. Written by\r\nTho: Dekker. _B. Alsop and T. Fawcet for H. Seile._ [Epistle to\r\nLodowick Carlell signed ‘Tho: Dekker’.]\r\n\r\nHerbert’s diary contains the entry on 21 Aug. 1623, ‘For the L.\r\nElizabeth’s servants of the Cockpit. An old play called Match me in\r\nLondon which had been formerly allowed by Sir G. Bucke.’ On this, some\r\nrather slight evidence from allusions, and a general theory that Dekker\r\ndid not write plays during his imprisonment of 1613–19, Fleay, i. 134,\r\nputs the original production by Queen Anne’s men _c._ 1611 and Hunt,\r\n160, in 1612–13. As there are some allusions to cards and the game of\r\nmaw, Fleay thinks the play a revision of _The Set at Maw_ produced\r\nby the Admiral’s on 15 Dec. 1594. Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 172) points\r\nout the weakness of the evidence, but finds some possible traces of\r\nrevision in the text.\r\n\r\n                    _The Virgin Martyr. c. 1620_\r\n\r\n                           _With_ Massinger.\r\n\r\n_S. R._ 1621, 7 Dec. (Buck). ‘A Tragedy called The Virgin Martir.’\r\n_Thomas Jones_ (Arber, iv. 62).\r\n\r\n1622. The Virgin Martir, A Tragedie, as it hath bin divers times\r\npublickely Acted with great Applause, By the seruants of his Maiesties\r\nReuels. Written by Phillip Messenger and Thomas Deker. _B. A. for\r\nThomas Jones._\r\n\r\n1631, 1651, 1661.\r\n\r\nThe play is said to have been ‘reformed’ and licensed by Buck for the\r\nRed Bull on 6 Oct. 1620 (Herbert, 29). An additional scene, licensed\r\non 7 July 1624 (_Var._ i. 424), did not find its way into print.\r\nFleay, i. 135, 212, asserts that the 1620 play was a refashioning by\r\nMassinger of a play by Dekker for the Queen’s about 1611, itself a\r\nrecast of _Diocletian_, produced by the Admiral’s on 16 Nov. 1594,\r\nbut ‘dating from 1591 at the latest’. He considers II. i, iii, III.\r\niii, and IV. ii of the 1620 version to be still Dekker’s. Ward, iii.\r\n12, and Hunt, 156, give most of the play to Dekker. But all these\r\nviews are impressionistic, and there is no special reason to suppose\r\nthat Massinger revised, rather than collaborated with, Dekker, or to\r\nassume a version of _c._ 1611. As for an earlier version still, Fleay’s\r\nevidence is trivial. In any case 1591 is out of the question, as\r\nHenslowe marked the _Diocletian_ of 1594 ‘n.e.’ Nor does he say it was\r\nby Dekker. A play on Dorothea the Martyr had made its way into Germany\r\nby 1626, but later German repertories disclose that there was also\r\na distinct play on Diocletian (Herz, 66, 103; Greg, _Henslowe_, ii.\r\n172). Greg, however, finds parts of _The Virgin Martyr_, ‘presumably\r\nDekker’s’, to be ‘undoubtedly early’. Oliphant (_E. S._ xvi. 191)\r\nmakes the alternative suggestion that _Diocletian_ was the basis of\r\nFletcher’s _Prophetess_, in which he believes the latter part of IV. i\r\nand V. i to be by an older hand, which he cannot identify. All this is\r\nvery indefinite.\r\n\r\n                    _The Witch of Edmonton. 1621_\r\n\r\n                      _With_ Ford and W. Rowley.\r\n\r\n_S.

Dyce (1869), A. H. Bullen\r\n(1895).\r\n\r\nI include this for the sake of completeness, but it is based upon a\r\npamphlet published in 1621 and was played at Court by the Prince’s men\r\non 29 Dec. 1621 (Murray, ii. 193). It is generally regarded as written\r\nin collaboration. Views as to its division amongst the writers are\r\nsummarized by Hunt, 178, and Pierce (_Anglia_, xxxvi. 289). The latter\r\nfinds Dekker in nearly all the scenes, Ford in four, Rowley perhaps in\r\nfive.\r\n\r\n                    _The Wonder of a Kingdom. 1623_\r\n\r\n                         _Possibly with_ Day.\r\n\r\n_S.

The Wonder of a Kingdome. Written by Thomas Dekker. _Robert\r\nRaworth for Nicholas Vavasour._\r\n\r\nHerbert’s diary for 18 Sept. 1623 has the entry: ‘For a company of\r\nstrangers. A new comedy called Come see a wonder, written by John\r\nDaye. It was acted at the Red Bull and licensed without my hand to\r\nit because they were none of the 4 companies.’ As _The Wonder of a\r\nKingdom_ contains scenes which are obviously from Day’s _Parliament of\r\nBees_ (_1608–16_) it is possible either to adopt the simple theory of\r\na collaboration between Day and Dekker in 1623, or to hold with Fleay,\r\ni. 136, and Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 174, that Day’s ‘new’ play of 1623\r\nwas a revision of an earlier one by Dekker. The mention of cards in the\r\nclosing lines seems an inadequate ground for Fleay’s further theory,\r\napparently approved by Greg, that the original play was _The Mack_,\r\nproduced by the Admiral’s on 21 Feb. 1595.\r\n\r\n                       _The Sun’s Darling. 1624_\r\n\r\n                             _With_ Ford.\r\n\r\n1656.

Reissue with same imprint.... ‘As it hath been often presented by\r\ntheir Majesties Servants; at the Cockpit in Drury Lane’....\r\n\r\n_Editions_ with _Works_ of John Ford, by H. Weber (1811), W.\r\nGifford (1827), H. Coleridge (1840, 1848, 1851), A. Dyce (1869), A. H.\r\nBullen (1895).\r\n\r\nThe play was licensed by Herbert for the Lady Elizabeth’s at the\r\nCockpit on 3 March 1624 (Chalmers, _S. A._ 217; Herbert, 27) and\r\nincluded in a list of Cockpit plays in 1639 (_Variorum_, iii. 159).\r\nFleay, i. 232, Ward, ii. 470, and Pierce (_Anglia_, xxxvi. 141) regard\r\nit as a revision by Ford of earlier work by Dekker, and the latter\r\nregards the last page of Act I, Acts II and III, and the prose of Acts\r\nIV and V as substantially Dekker’s. It is perhaps a step from this\r\nto the theory of Fleay and Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 190) that the play\r\nrepresents the _Phaethon_, which Dekker wrote for the Admiral’s in\r\nJan. 1598 and afterwards altered for a Court performance at Christmas\r\n1600. There are allusions to ‘humours’ and to ‘pampered jades of Asia’\r\n(ed. Pearson, pp. 316, 318) which look early, but Phaethon is not a\r\ncharacter, nor is the story his. A priest of the Sun appears in Act I:\r\nI am surprised that Fleay did not identify him, though he is not mad,\r\nwith the ‘mad priest of the sun’ referred to in Greene’s (q.v.) Epistle\r\nto _Perimedes_. The play is not a ‘masque’ in the ordinary sense.\r\n\r\n                      _The Noble Soldier > 1631_\r\n\r\n                       _With_ Day and S. Rowley?\r\n\r\n_S.

The Noble Souldier, Or, A Contract Broken, justly reveng’d. A\r\nTragedy. Written by S. R. _For Nicholas Vavasour._\r\n\r\n_Editions_ by A. H. Bullen (1882, _O. E. P._ i) and J. S. Farmer (1913,\r\n_S. F. T._).\r\n\r\nThe printer tells us that the author was dead in 1634.\r\n\r\nThe initials may indicate Samuel Rowley of the Admiral’s and Prince\r\nHenry’s. Bullen and Hunt, 187, think that Dekker revised work by\r\nRowley. But probably Day also contributed, for II. i, ii; III. ii;\r\nIV. i; V. i, ii, and parts of I. ii and V. iv are drawn like scenes\r\nin _The Wonder of a Kingdom_ from his _Parliament of Bees_ (1608–16).\r\nFleay, i. 128, identifies the play with _The Spanish Fig_ for which\r\nHenslowe made a payment on behalf of the Admiral’s in Jan. 1602. This\r\nGreg (_Henslowe_, ii. 220) thinks ‘plausible’, regarding the play as\r\n‘certainly an old play of about 1600, presumably by Dekker and Rowley\r\nwith later additions by Day’. He notes that the King is not, as Fleay\r\nalleged, poisoned with a Spanish fig, but a Spanish fig is mentioned,\r\n‘and it is quite possible that such may have been the mode of poisoning\r\nin the original piece’. Henslowe does not name the payee for _The\r\nSpanish Fig_, and it was apparently not finished at the time.\r\n\r\n                       _Lost and Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to set out all the certain or conjectured work by\r\nDekker mentioned in Henslowe’s Diary.\r\n\r\n             (a) _Conjectural anonymous Work before 1598_\r\n\r\n(i) _Philipo and Hippolito._\r\n\r\nProduced as a new play by the Admiral’s on 9 July 1594. The ascription\r\nto Dekker, confident in Fleay, i. 213, and regarded as possible\r\nby Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 165), appears to be due to the entry of a\r\n_Philenzo and Hypollita_ by Massinger, who revised other early work of\r\nDekker, in the S. R. on 29 June 1660, to the entry of a _Philenzo and\r\nHipolito_ by Massinger in Warburton’s list of burnt plays (_3 Library_,\r\nii. 231), and to the appearance of a _Julio and Hyppolita_ in the\r\nGerman collection of 1620. A copy of Massinger’s play is said (Collier,\r\n_Henslowe_, xxxi) to be amongst the _Conway MSS._\r\n\r\n(ii) _The Jew of Venice._\r\n\r\nEntered as a play by Dekker in the S. R. on 9 Sept. 1653 (_3 Library_,\r\nii. 241). It has been suggested (Fleay, i. 121, and _Sh._ 30, 197; Greg\r\nin _Henslowe_, ii. 170) that it was the source of a German play printed\r\nfrom a Vienna MS. by Meissner, 131 (cf. Herz, 84). In this a personage\r\ndisguises himself as a French doctor, which leads to the conjectural\r\nidentification of its English original both with _The Venetian Comedy_\r\nproduced by the Admiral’s on 27 Aug. 1594 and with _The French Doctor_\r\nperformed by the same men on 19 Oct. 1594 and later dates and bought by\r\nthem from Alleyn in 1602. The weakest point in all this guesswork is\r\nthe appearance of common themes in the German play and in _The Merchant\r\nof Venice_, which Fleay explains to his own satisfaction by the\r\nassumption that Shakespeare based _The Merchant of Venice_ on Dekker’s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n(iii) _Dr. Faustus._\r\n\r\nRevived by the Admiral’s on 30 Sept. 1594.

Marlowe.\r\n\r\n(iv) _Diocletian._\r\n\r\nProduced by the Admiral’s, 16 Nov. 1599; cf. s.v. _The Virgin Martyr_\r\n(_supra_).\r\n\r\n(v) _The Set at Maw._\r\n\r\nProduced by the Admiral’s on 14 Dec. 1594; cf. s.v. _Match Me in\r\nLondon_ (_supra_).\r\n\r\n(vi) _Antony and Valia._\r\n\r\nRevived by the Admiral’s, 4 Jan. 1595, and ascribed by Fleay, i. 213,\r\nwith some encouragement from Greg in _Henslowe_, ii. 174, to Dekker, on\r\nthe ground of entries in the S. R. on 29 June 1660 and in Warburton’s\r\nlist of burnt plays (_3 Library_, ii. 231) of an _Antonio and Vallia_\r\nby Massinger, who revised other early work by Dekker.\r\n\r\n(vii) _The Mack._\r\n\r\nProduced by the Admiral’s on 21 Feb. 1595; cf. s.v. _The Wonder of a\r\nKingdom_ (_supra_).\r\n\r\n(viii) _1 Fortunatus._\r\n\r\nRevived by the Admiral’s on 3 Feb. 1596; cf. s.v. _Old Fortunatus_\r\n(_supra_).\r\n\r\n(ix) _Stukeley._\r\n\r\nProduced by the Admiral’s on 11 Dec. 1596.

John Chamberlain (Birch, i. 202) says\r\nthat the Palsgrave was present and Henry kept away by his illness,\r\nthat the show was ‘somewhat extraordinary’ and the water procession\r\nwrecked by ‘great winds’. At Paul’s Chain the Mayor was met by the\r\n‘first triumph’, a sea-chariot, bearing Neptune and Luna, with a\r\nship of wine. Neptune made a speech. At Paul’s Churchyard came ‘the\r\nsecond land-triumph’, the throne or chariot of Virtue, drawn by four\r\nhorses on which sat Time, Mercury, Desire, and Industry. Virtue made\r\na speech, and both pageants preceded the Mayor down Cheapside. At the\r\nlittle Conduit in Cheapside was the Castle of Envy, between whom and\r\nVirtue there was a dialogue, followed by fireworks from the castle. At\r\nthe Cross in Cheapside was another ‘triumph’, the House of Fame, with\r\nrepresentations of famous Merchant Tailors, ‘a perticular roome being\r\nreserved for one that represents the person of Henry, the now Prince\r\nof Wales’. After a speech by Fame, the pageant joined the procession,\r\nand from it was heard a song on the way to the Guildhall. On the way\r\nto Paul’s after dinner, Virtue and Envy were again beheld, and at the\r\nMayor’s door a speech was made by Justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DELONEY (_c._ 1543–_c._ 1600).\r\n\r\nA ballad writer and pamphleteer, who wrote a ballad on the visit to\r\nTilbury in 1588. See ch. xxiv, C.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT DEVEREUX, EARL OF ESSEX (1566–1601).\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Essex, who sometimes dabbled in literature, had\r\nhimself a hand in the device of _Love and Self-Love_, with which\r\nhe entertained Elizabeth on 17 Nov. 1595, and of which some of the\r\nspeeches are generally credited to Bacon (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DODD (_c._ 1597–1602).\r\n\r\nA Scholar and Fellow of St. John’s, Cambridge, and a conjectured author\r\nof _Parnassus_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHAEL DRAYTON (_c._ 1563–1631).\r\n\r\nDrayton was born at Hartshill in Warwickshire, and brought up in the\r\nhousehold of Sir Henry Goodyere of Polesworth, whose daughter Anne,\r\nafterwards Lady Rainsford, is the Idea of his pastorals and sonnets.\r\nWith _The Harmony of the Church_ (1591) began a life-long series of\r\nambitious poems, in all the characteristic Elizabethan manners, for\r\nwhich Drayton found many patrons, notably Lucy Lady Bedford, Sir Walter\r\nAston of Tixall, Prince Henry and Prince Charles, and Edward Earl of\r\nDorset. The guerdons of his pen were not sufficient to keep him from\r\nhaving recourse to the stage. Meres classed him in 1598 among the\r\n‘best for tragedy’, and Henslowe’s diary shows him a busy writer for\r\nthe Admiral’s men, almost invariably in collaboration with Dekker and\r\nothers, from Dec. 1597 to Jan. 1599, and a more occasional one from\r\nOct. 1599 to May 1602. At a later date he may possibly have written for\r\nQueen Anne’s men, since commendatory verses by T. Greene are prefixed\r\nto his _Poems_ of 1605. In 1608 he belonged to the King’s Revels\r\nsyndicate at Whitefriars. No later connexion with the stage can be\r\ntraced, and he took no steps to print his plays with his other works.\r\nHis Elegy to Henry Reynolds of _Poets and Poesie_ (C. Brett, _Drayton’s\r\nMinor Poems_, 108) does honour to Marlowe, Shakespeare, Jonson, and\r\nBeaumont, and tradition makes him a partaker in the drinking-bout that\r\nled to Shakespeare’s end. Jonson wrote commendatory verses for him in\r\n1627, but in 1619 had told Drummond (Laing, 10) that ‘Drayton feared\r\nhim; and he esteemed not of him’. The irresponsible Fleay, i. 361;\r\nii. 271, 323, identifies him with Luculento of _E. M. O._, Captain\r\nJenkins of Dekker and Webster’s _Northward Ho!_, and the eponym of the\r\nanonymous _Sir Giles Goosecap_; Small, 98, with the Decius criticized\r\nin the anonymous _Jack Drum’s Entertainment_, who may also be Dekker.\r\n\r\nThe collections of Drayton’s _Poems_ do not include his\r\nplays.--_Dissertations_: O.

T._).\r\n\r\nHenslowe advanced £10 to the Admiral’s as payment to Munday, Drayton,\r\nWilson, and Hathway for the first part of ‘the lyfe of S^r Jhon\r\nOuldcasstell’ and in earnest for the second part on 16 Oct. 1599,\r\nand an additional 10_s._ for the poets ‘at the playnge of S^r John\r\nOldcastell the ferste tyme as a gefte’ between 1 and 8 Nov. 1599.\r\nDrayton had £4 for the second part between 19 and 26 Dec. 1599, and\r\nproperties were being bought for it in March 1600. It is not preserved.\r\nBy Aug. 1602 the play had been transferred to Worcester’s men. More\r\nproperties were bought, doubtless for a revival, and Dekker had £2\r\n10_s._ for ‘new a dicyons’. Fleay, ii. 116, attempts to disentangle the\r\nwork of the collaborators. Clearly the play was an answer to _Henry\r\nIV_, in which Sir John Falstaff was originally Sir John Oldcastle, and\r\nthis is made clear in the prologue:\r\n\r\n    It is no pampered glutton we present,\r\n    Nor aged Councellour to youthfull sinne.\r\n\r\n                       _Doubtful and Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nFor ascriptions see _Edward IV_, _London Prodigal_, _Merry Devil of\r\nEdmonton_, _Sir T.

He took orders, became Chaplain to the Queen, and was\r\nappointed Canon of Christ Church in 1586 and Dean of Worcester in 1597.\r\nSome of his verse, both in English and Latin, has survived, and Meres\r\nincludes him in 1598 amongst ‘our best for Tragedie’. The Epilogue,\r\nin Latin prose, of a play called _Caesar Interfectus_, which was both\r\nwritten and spoken by him, is given by F. Peck in _A Collection of\r\nCurious Historical Pieces_, appended to his _Memoirs of Cromwell_\r\n(1740), and by Boas, 163, from _Bodl. MS. Top. Oxon._ e. 5, f. 359. A\r\nlater hand has added the date 1582, from which Boas infers that _Caesar\r\nInterfectus_, of which Edes was probably the author, was one of three\r\ntragedies recorded in the Christ Church accounts for Feb.–March 1582.\r\nEdes appears to have written or contributed to Sir Henry Lee’s (q.v.)\r\nWoodstock Entertainment of 1592.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD EDWARDES (_c._ 1523–1566).\r\n\r\nEdwardes was a Somersetshire man. He entered Corpus Christi College,\r\nOxford, on 11 May 1540, and became Senior Student of Christ Church in\r\n1547. Before the end of Edward’s reign he was seeking his fortune at\r\nCourt and had a fee or annuity of £6 13_s._ 4_d._ (Stopes, _Hunnis_,\r\n147). He must not be identified with the George Edwardes of Chapel\r\nlists, _c._ 1553 (ibid. 23; _Shakespeare’s Environment_, 238; Rimbault,\r\nx), but was of the Chapel by 1 Jan. 1557 (Nichols, _Eliz._ i. xxxv;\r\n_Illustrations_, App. 14), when he made a New Year’s gift of ‘certeigne\r\nverses’, and was confirmed in office by an Elizabethan patent of 27\r\nMay 1560. He succeeded Bower as Master of the Children, receiving his\r\npatent of appointment on 27 Oct. 1561 and a commission to take up\r\nchildren on 4 Dec. 1561 (Wallace, i. 106; ii. 65; cf. ch. xii). Barnabe\r\nGooge in his _Eglogs, Epytaphes and Sonettes_ (15 March 1563) puts his\r\n‘doyngs’ above those of Plautus and Terence. In addition to plays at\r\nCourt, he took his boys on 2 Feb. 1565 and 2 Feb. 1566 to Lincoln’s Inn\r\n(cf. ch. vii), of which he had become a member on 25 Nov. 1564 (_L. I.\r\nAdmission Register_, i. 72). He appeared at Court as a ‘post’ on behalf\r\nof the challengers for a tilt in Nov. 1565 (cf. ch. iv). In 1566 he\r\nhelped in the entertainment of Elizabeth at Oxford, and on Oct. 31 of\r\nthat year he died. His reputation as poet and dramatist is testified\r\nto in verses by Barnabe Googe, George Turberville, Thomas Twine, and\r\nothers and proved enduring. The author [Richard Puttenham?] of _The\r\nArte of English Poesie_ (1589) couples him with the Earl of Oxford as\r\ndeserving the highest price for comedy and enterlude, and Francis Meres\r\nin his _Palladis Tamia_ (1598) includes him amongst those ‘best for\r\ncomedy’. Several of his poems are in _The Paradise of Dainty Devices_\r\n(1576). Warton, iv. 218, says that William Collins (the poet) had a\r\nvolume of prose stories printed in 1570, ‘sett forth by maister Richard\r\nEdwardes mayster of her maiesties revels’. One of these contained\r\na version of the jest used in the _Induction_ of _The Taming of the\r\nShrew_ (q.v.). There is nothing else to connect Edwardes with the\r\nRevels office, and probably ‘revels’ in Warton’s account is a mistake\r\nfor ‘children’ or ‘chapel’.\r\n\r\n_Dissertations_: W. Y.

N._ xxii. 236).\r\n\r\nThe play is not divided into acts or scenes; the characters include\r\nCarisophus a parasite, and Grim the Collier. The prologue [not that\r\nused at Court] warns the audience that they will be ‘frustrate quite\r\nof toying plays’ and that the author’s muse that ‘masked in delight’\r\nand to some ‘seemed too much in young desires to range’ will leave such\r\nsports and write a ‘tragical comedy ... mixed with mirth and care’.\r\nEdwardes adds (cf. App. C, No. ix):\r\n\r\n    Wherein, talking of courtly toys, we do protest this flat,\r\n    We talk of Dionysius court, we mean no court but that.\r\n\r\nA song at the end wishes Elizabeth joy and describes her as ‘void of\r\nall sickness, in most perfect health’. Durand uses this reference to\r\ndate the play in the early months of 1565, since a letter of De Silva\r\n(_Sp. P._ i. 400) records that Elizabeth had a feverish cold since\r\n8 Dec. 1564, but was better by 2 Jan. 1565. He identifies the play\r\nwith the ‘Edwardes tragedy’ of the Revels Accounts for 1564–5 (cf.\r\nApp. B), and points out that there is an entry in those accounts for\r\n‘rugge bumbayst and cottone for hosse’, and that in _Damon and Pythias_\r\n(Dodsley, iv. 71) the boys have stuffed breeches with ‘seven ells of\r\nrug’ to one hose. A proclamation of 6 May 1562 (_Procl._ 562) had\r\nforbidden the use of more than a yard and three-quarters of stuff in\r\nthe ‘stockes’ of hose, and an enforcing proclamation (_Procl._ 619) was\r\nrequired on 12 Feb. 1566. Boas, 157, notes a revival at Merton in 1568.\r\n\r\nFleay, 60, thinks that the play contains attacks on the Paul’s boys\r\nin return for satire of Edwardes as Ralph Roister in Ulpian Fulwell’s\r\n_Like Will to Like_ (q.v.).\r\n\r\n                              _Lost Play_\r\n\r\n                      _Palamon and Arcite. 1566_\r\n\r\nThis play was acted in two parts on 2 and 4 Sept. 1566, before\r\nElizabeth in the Hall of Christ Church, Oxford (cf. ch. iv). The first\r\nnight was made memorable by the fall of part of the staircase wall,\r\nby which three persons were killed. The Queen was sorry, but the play\r\nwent on. She gave Edwardes great thanks for his pains. The play was\r\nin English. Several contemporary writers assign it to Edwardes, and\r\nNicholas Robinson adds that he and other Christ Church men translated\r\nit out of Latin, and that he remained two months in Oxford working at\r\nit. Bereblock gives a long analysis of the action, which shows that,\r\neven if there is no error as to the intervening Latin version, the\r\noriginal source was clearly Chaucer’s _Knight’s Tale_. W. Y. Durand,\r\n_Journ. Germ. Phil._ iv. 356, argues that Edwardes’s play was not a\r\nsource of _Two Noble Kinsmen_, on the ground of the divergence between\r\nthat and Bereblock’s summary.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence of any edition of the play, although Plummer, xxi,\r\nsays that it ‘has been several times printed’.\r\n\r\n                           _Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nFleay, ii. 295, assigns to Edwardes _Godly Queen Hester_, a play of\r\nwhich he had only seen a few lines, and which W. W. Greg, in his\r\nedition in _Materialien_, v, has shown with great probability to date\r\nfrom about 1525–9. His hand has also been sought in R. B.’s _Apius and\r\nVirginia_ and in _Misogonus_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH (1533–1603).\r\n\r\nH. H. E. Craster (_E. H. R._ xxix. 722) includes in a list of\r\nElizabeth’s English translations a chorus from Act II of the\r\npseudo-Senecan _Hercules Oetaeus_, extant in _Bodl. MS. e Museo_, 55,\r\nf. 48, and printed in H. Walpole, _Royal and Noble Authors_ (ed. Park,\r\n1806), i. 102. It probably dates later than 1561. But he can find no\r\nevidence for a Latin version of a play of Euripides referred to by\r\nWalpole, i. 85.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD FARRANT (?-1580).\r\n\r\nFarrant’s career as Master of the Children of Windsor and Deputy Master\r\nof the Children of the Chapel and founder of the first Blackfriars\r\ntheatre has been described in chh. xii and xvii. It is not improbable\r\nthat he wrote plays for the boys, and W. J. Lawrence, _The Earliest\r\nPrivate Theatre Play_ (_T. L. S._, 11 Aug. 1921), thinks that one of\r\nthese was _Wars of Cyrus_ (cf. ch. xxiv), probably based on W. Barker’s\r\ntranslation (1567) of Xenophon’s _Cyropaedia_, and that the song of\r\nPanthea ascribed to Farrant in a Christ Church manuscript (cf. vol.\r\nii, p. 63) has dropped out from the extant text of this. Farrant’s\r\nsong, ‘O Jove from stately throne’, mentioning Altages, may be from\r\nanother play. I think that _Wars of Cyrus_, as it stands, is clearly\r\npost-_Tamburlaine_, and although there are indications of lost songs\r\nat ll. 985, 1628, there is none pointing to a lament of Panthea. But\r\nconceivably the play was based on one by Farrant.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE FEREBE (_c._ 1573–1613 <)\r\n\r\nA musician and Vicar of Bishop’s Cannings, Wilts.\r\n\r\n                      _The Shepherd’s Song. 1613_\r\n\r\n_S.

He\r\nmade severall of his neighbours good musitians, to play with him in\r\nconsort, and to sing. Against her majesties comeing, he made a pleasant\r\npastorall, and gave her an entertaynment with his fellow songsters\r\nin shepherds’ weeds and bagpipes, he himself like an old bard. After\r\nthat wind musique was over, they sang their pastorall eglogues\r\n(which I have, to insert into Liber B).’ Wood’s similar account in\r\n_Fasti_ (1815), i. 270, is probably based on Aubrey’s. He dates the\r\nentertainment June 11 (cf. ch. iv. and App. A, s. ann. 1613), and gives\r\nthe opening of the song as\r\n\r\n    Shine, O thou sacred Shepherds Star,\r\n        On silly shepherd swaines.\r\n\r\nAubrey has a shorter notice in another manuscript and adds, ‘He gave\r\nanother entertaynment in Cote-field to King James, with carters\r\nsinging, with whipps in their hands; and afterwards, a footeball play’.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE FERRERS (_c._ 1500–79).\r\n\r\nA Lincoln’s Inn lawyer, son of Thomas Ferrers of St. Albans, who\r\nwas Page of the Chamber to Henry VIII, and acted as Lord of Misrule\r\nto Edward VI at the Christmases of 1551–2 and 1552–3 (_Mediaeval\r\nStage_, i. 405; Feuillerat, _Edw. and M._ 56, 77, 90). He sat in\r\nParliaments of both Mary and Elizabeth, and wrote some of the poems\r\nin _The Mirror for Magistrates_ (1559–78). He contributed verses to\r\nthe Kenilworth entertainment of 1575, must then have been a very old\r\nman, and died in 1579. Puttenham says of Edward VI’s time, ‘Maister\r\n_Edward Ferrys_ ... wrate for the most part to the stage, in Tragedie\r\nand sometimes in Comedie or Enterlude’, and again, ‘For Tragedie, the\r\nLord of Buckhurst & Maister _Edward Ferrys_, for such doings as I\r\nhaue sene of theirs, do deserue the hyest price’; and is followed by\r\nMeres, who places ‘Master Edward Ferris, the author of the _Mirror for\r\nMagistrates_’ amongst ‘our best for Tragedie’ (cf. App. C, Nos. xli,\r\nlii). Obviously George Ferrers is meant, but Anthony Wood hunted out an\r\nEdward Ferrers, belonging to another family, of Baddesley Clinton, in\r\nWarwickshire, and took him for the dramatist. He died in 1564 and had a\r\nson Henry, amongst whose papers were found verses belonging to certain\r\nentertainments, mostly of the early ‘nineties, which an indiscreet\r\neditor thereupon ascribed to George Ferrers (cf. s.v. Sir H. Lee).\r\n\r\n\r\nNATHAN FIELD (1587–?).\r\n\r\nFor life _vide supra_ Actors (ch. xv).\r\n\r\n                 _A Woman is a Weathercock. 1609_ (?)\r\n\r\n_S.

Fleay, i.\r\n185, notes that I. ii refers to the Cleve wars, which began in 1609.\r\nThe Revels children were not at Court in 1610–11. In his verses to _The\r\nFaithful Shepherdess_ (1609–10) Field hopes for his ‘muse in swathing\r\nclouts’, to ‘perfect such a work as’ Fletcher’s. The first Epistle\r\npromises that when his next play is printed, any woman ‘shall see what\r\namends I have made to her and all the sex’; the second ends, ‘If thou\r\nhast anything to say to me, thou know’st where to hear of me for a year\r\nor two, and no more, I assure thee’, as if Field did not mean to spend\r\nhis life as a player.\r\n\r\n                      _Amends for Ladies. > 1611_\r\n\r\n1618.

Collier, iii. 434,\r\nand Fleay, i. 201, confirm this from an allusion to the play in A.\r\nStafford’s _Admonition to a Discontented Romanist_, appended to his\r\n_Niobe Dissolved into a Nilus_ (S. R. 10 Oct. 1611). Fleay is less\r\nhappy in fixing an inferior limit of date by the publication of the\r\nversion of the _Curious Impertinent_ story in Shelton’s _Don Quixote_\r\n(1612), since that story was certainly available in Baudouin’s French\r\ntranslation as early as 1608. The introduction of Moll Cutpurse\r\nsuggests rivalry with Dekker and Middleton’s _Roaring Girl_ (also _c._\r\n1610–11) at the Fortune, which theatre is chaffed in ii. 1 and iii. 4.\r\n\r\n                             _Later Play_\r\n\r\n_The Fatal Dowry_ (1632), a King’s men’s play, assigned on the\r\ntitle-page to P.

His cousins, Giles and Phineas, are known as poets. He seems\r\ntoo young for the John Fletcher of London who entered Corpus Christi,\r\nCambridge, in 1591. After his father’s death in 1596, nothing is heard\r\nof him until his emergence as a dramatist, and of this the date cannot\r\nbe precisely fixed. Davenant says that ‘full twenty yeares, he wore\r\nthe bayes’, which would give 1605, but this is in a prologue to _The\r\nWoman Hater_, which Davenant apparently thought Fletcher’s, although\r\nit is Beaumont’s; and Oliphant’s attempt to find his hand, on metrical\r\ngrounds, in _Captain Thomas Stukeley_ (1605) rests only on one not\r\nvery conclusive scene. But he had almost certainly written for the\r\nQueen’s Revels before the beginning, about 1608, of his collaboration\r\nwith Beaumont, under whom his later career is outlined. It is possible\r\nthat he is the John Fletcher who married Joan Herring on 3 Nov. 1612\r\nat St. Saviour’s, Southwark, and had a son John about Feb. 1620 in St.\r\nBartholomew’s the Great (Dyce, i. lxxiii), and if so one may put the\r\nfact with Aubrey’s gossip (cf. s.v. Beaumont), and with Oldwit’s speech\r\nin Shadwell’s _Bury-Fair_ (1689): ‘I knew Fletcher, my friend Fletcher,\r\nand his maid Joan; well, I shall never forget him: I have supped with\r\nhim at his house on the Bankside; he loved a fat loin of pork of all\r\nthings in the world; and Joan his maid had her beer-glass of sack;\r\nand we all kissed her, i’ faith, and were as merry as passed.’ I have\r\nsometimes wondered whether Jonson is chaffing Beaumont and Fletcher\r\nin _Bartholomew Fair_ (1614), V. iii, iv, as Damon and Pythias, ‘two\r\nfaithfull friends o’ the Bankside’, that ‘have both but one drabbe’,\r\nand enter with a gammon of bacon under their cloaks. I do not think\r\nthis can refer to Francis Bacon. Fletcher died in Aug. 1625 and was\r\nburied in St. Saviour’s (_Athenaeum_, 1886, ii. 252).\r\n\r\nFor Plays _vide_ s.v. Beaumont, and for the ascribed lost play of\r\n_Cardenio_, s.v. Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHINEAS FLETCHER (1582–1650).\r\n\r\nPhineas Fletcher, son of Giles, a diplomatist and poet, brother of\r\nGiles, a poet, and first cousin of John (q.v.), was baptized at\r\nCranbrook, Kent, on 8 April 1582. From Eton he passed to King’s\r\nCollege, Cambridge, where he took his B.A. in 1604, his M.A. in 1608,\r\nand became a Fellow in 1611. He was Chaplain to Sir Henry Willoughby of\r\nRisley from 1616 to 1621, and thereafter Rector of Hilgay, Norfolk, to\r\nhis death in 1650. He wrote much Spenserian poetry, but his dramatic\r\nwork was purely academic. In addition to _Sicelides_, he may have\r\nwritten an English comedy, for which a payment was made to him by\r\nKing’s about Easter 1607 (Boas, i. xx).\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1869.

But amongst plays entered as his by\r\nHumphrey Moseley on 29 June 1660 (Eyre, ii. 271) are:\r\n\r\n   ‘An ill begining has A good end, and a bad begining may have a\r\n   good end, a Comedy.’\r\n\r\n   ‘The London Merchant, a Comedy.’\r\n\r\nThese ascriptions recur in Warburton’s list of lost plays (_3 Library_,\r\nii. 231), where the first play has the title ‘A good beginning may\r\nhave A good end’. It is possible, therefore, that Ford either wrote or\r\nrevised the play of ‘A badd beginininge makes a good endinge’, which\r\nwas performed by the King’s men at Court during 1612–13 (cf. App. B).\r\nOne may suspect the _London Merchant_ to be a mistake for the _Bristow\r\nMerchant_ of Ford and Dekker (q.v.) in 1624. The offer of the title in\r\n_K. B. P._ ind. 11 hardly proves that there was really a play of _The\r\nLondon Merchant_. Ford’s _Honor Triumphant: or The Peeres Challenge,\r\nby Armes defensible at Tilt, Turney, and Barriers_ (1606; ed. _Sh.\r\nSoc._ 1843) is a thesis motived by the jousts in honour of Christian of\r\nDenmark (cf. ch. iv). It has an Epistle to the Countesses of Pembroke\r\nand Montgomery, and contains four arguments in defence of amorous\r\npropositions addressed respectively to the Duke of Lennox and the Earls\r\nof Arundel, Pembroke, and Montgomery.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD FORSETT (_c._ 1553–_c._ 1630).\r\n\r\nA political writer (_D. N. B._) and probable author of the academic\r\n_Pedantius_ (cf. App. K).\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM FRAUNCE (_c._ 1558–1633 <).\r\n\r\nFraunce was a native of Shrewsbury, and passed from the school of\r\nthat place, where he obtained the friendship of Philip Sidney, to\r\nSt. John’s, Cambridge, in 1576. He took his B.A. in 1580, played in\r\nLegge’s academic _Richardus Tertius_ and in _Hymenaeus_ (Boas, 394),\r\nwhich he may conceivably have written (cf. App. K), became Fellow of\r\nthe college in 1581, and took his M.A. in 1583. He became a Gray’s Inn\r\nman, dedicated various treatises on logic and experiments in English\r\nhexameters to members of the Sidney and Herbert families during\r\n1583–92, and appears to have obtained through their influence some\r\noffice under the Presidency of Wales. He dropped almost entirely out of\r\nletters, but seems to have been still alive in 1633.\r\n\r\n                             _Latin Play_\r\n\r\n                        _Victoria. 1580 < > 3_\r\n\r\n[_MS._] In possession of Lord De L’Isle and Dudley at Penshurst, headed\r\n‘Victoria’.

As Sidney was knighted on 13 Jan. 1583, the play was probably\r\nwritten, perhaps for performance at St. John’s, Cambridge, before that\r\ndate and after Fraunce took his B.A. in 1580.\r\n\r\n                             _Translation_\r\n\r\n                      _Phillis and Amyntas. 1591_\r\n\r\n_S.

There is nothing to show that Fraunce’s\r\nversion of _Aminta_ was ever acted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FULBECK (1560–1603?).\r\n\r\nHe entered Gray’s Inn in 1584, contributed two speeches to the\r\n_Misfortunes of Arthur_ of Thomas Hughes (q.v.) in 1588, and wrote\r\nvarious legal and historical books.\r\n\r\n\r\nULPIAN FULWELL (_c._ 1568).\r\n\r\nFulwell was born in Somersetshire and educated at St. Mary’s\r\nHall, Oxford.

There is a prayer for the Queen at the end.\r\n\r\nThis might be _The Collier_ played at Court in 1576. Fleay, 60; i.\r\n235, puts it in 1561–3, assigns it to the Paul’s boys, and suggests\r\nthat Richard Edwardes (q.v.) is satirized as Ralph Roister. Greg\r\n(_Henslowe_, ii. 228) suggests that Fulwell’s may be the play revived\r\nby Pembroke’s at the Rose on 28 Oct. 1600 as ‘the [devell] licke vnto\r\nlicke’.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GAGER (> 1560–1621).\r\n\r\nGager entered Christ Church, Oxford, from Westminster in 1574, and took\r\nhis B.A. in 1577, his M.A. in 1580, and his D.C.L. in 1589. In 1606 he\r\nbecame Chancellor of the diocese of Ely. He had a high reputation for\r\nhis Latin verses, many of which are contained in _Exequiae D. Philippi\r\nSidnaei_ (1587) and other University volumes. A large collection\r\nin _Addl. MS._ 22583 includes lines to George Peele (q.v.). Meres\r\nin 1598 counts him as one of ‘the best for comedy amongst vs’. His\r\ncorrespondence with John Rainolds affords a summary of the controversy\r\non the ethics of the stage in its academic aspect.\r\n\r\n                             _Latin Plays_\r\n\r\n                         _Meleager.

It is assigned to Gager by A. Wood, _Annals_, ii. 216, and\r\nreferred to as his in the controversy with Rainolds (Boas, 181), who\r\nspeaks of it as ‘the vnprinted Comedie’, and criticizes its ‘filth’.\r\nIt contained scenes of country wooing, drunken sailors, a _miles\r\ngloriosus_, a _blanda lena_. The prologue to _Dido_ says of it:\r\n\r\n    Hesterna Mopsum scena ridiculum dedit.\r\n\r\nIt was revived at Christ Church on 7 Feb. 1592 (Boas, 197) and again at\r\nthe same place before Elizabeth on 26 Sept. 1592, when, according to a\r\nCambridge critic, it was ‘but meanely performed’. Presumably it is the\r\nprologue for this revival which is printed with _Ulysses Redux_ (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nBERNARD GARTER (_c._ 1578).\r\n\r\nA London citizen, whose few and mainly non-dramatic writings were\r\nproduced from 1565 to 1579.

He was probably born between 1530 and 1535, and was\r\neducated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and Gray’s Inn. He misspent\r\nhis youth as a dissipated hanger-on at Court, under the patronage of\r\nArthur, Lord Grey of Wilton and others, and won some reputation as\r\na versifier. About 1566 he married Elizabeth Breton of Walthamstow,\r\nwidow of a London merchant, and mother of Nicholas Breton, the poet.\r\nFrom March 1573 to Oct. 1574 he served as a volunteer under William of\r\nOrange in the Netherlands. In 1575 he was assisting in preparing shows\r\nbefore Elizabeth at Kenilworth and Woodstock. It is possible that he\r\nwas again in the Netherlands and present at the sack of Antwerp in\r\n1576. On 7 Oct. 1577 he died at Stamford.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\nN.D.

Meres in _Palladis Tamia_ (1598) commends his\r\npastorals, which are lost. Lodge speaks of him also as a ‘player’.[658]\r\nIn 1579 he forsook the stage, became a tutor in the country and\r\npublished _The School of Abuse_ (App. C, No. xxii). This he dedicated\r\nto Sidney, but ‘was for his labour scorned’. He was answered the same\r\nyear in a lost pamphlet called _Strange News out of Afric_ and also\r\nby Lodge (q.v.), and rejoined with _A Short Apology of the School of\r\nAbuse_ (App. C, No. xxiv). The players revived his plays to spite\r\nhim and on 23 Feb. 1582 produced _The Play of Plays and Pastimes_ to\r\nconfute him. In the same year he produced his final contribution to\r\nthe controversy in _Plays Confuted in Five Actions_ (App. C, No. xxx).\r\nIn 1591 Gosson became Rector of Great Wigborough, Essex, and in 1595\r\npublished the anonymous pamphlet _Pleasant Quips for Upstart Newfangled\r\nGentlewomen_. In 1600 he became Rector of St. Botolph’s, Bishopsgate.\r\nIn 1616 and 1617 he wrote to Alleyn (q.v.) as his ‘very loving and\r\nancient friend’.[659] He died 13 Feb. 1624.\r\n\r\nGosson claims to have written both tragedies and comedies,[660] but\r\nno play of his is extant. He names three of them. Of _Catiline’s\r\nConspiracies_ he says that it was ‘usually brought into the Theater\r\nand that ‘because it is known to be a pig of mine own sow, I will\r\nspeak the less of it; only giving you to understand, that the whole\r\nmark which I shot at in that work was to show the reward of traitors\r\nin Catiline, and the necessary government of learned men in the person\r\nof Cicero, which foresees every danger that is likely to happen and\r\nforestalls it continually ere it take effect’.[661] Lodge disparages\r\nthe originality of this play and compares it unfavourably with Wilson’s\r\n_Short and Sweet_[662] (q.v.). Of two other plays Gosson says: ‘Since\r\nmy publishing the _School of Abuse_ two plays of my making were brought\r\nto the stage; the one was a cast of Italian devices, called, The Comedy\r\nof _Captain Mario_; the other a Moral, _Praise at Parting_. These they\r\nvery impudently affirm to be written by me since I had set out my\r\ninvective against them. I can not deny they were both mine, but they\r\nwere both penned two years at the least before I forsook them, as by\r\ntheir own friends I am able to prove.’[663] It is conceivable that\r\nGosson may be the translator of _Fedele and Fortunio_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT GREENE (1558–92).\r\n\r\nRobert Greene was baptized at Norwich on 11 July 1558. He entered St.\r\nJohn’s College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1575 and took his B.A. in\r\n1578 and his M.A. by 1583, when he was residing in Clare Hall. The\r\naddition of an Oxford degree in July 1588 enabled him to describe\r\nhimself as _Academiae Utriusque Magister in Artibus_. He has been\r\nidentified with a Robert Greene who was Vicar of Tollesbury, Essex,\r\nin 1584–5, but there is no real evidence that he took orders. The\r\nearlier part of his career may be gathered from his autobiographic\r\npamphlet, _The Repentance of Robert Greene_ (1592), eked out by the\r\nportraits, also evidently in a measure autobiographic, of Francesco\r\nin _Never Too Late_ (1590) and of Roberto in _Green’s Groats-worth\r\nof Wit bought with a Million of Repentance_ (1592). It seems that he\r\ntravelled in youth and learnt much wickedness; then married and lived\r\nfor a while with his wife and had a child by her. During this period\r\nhe began his series of euphuistic love-romances. About 1586, however,\r\nhe deserted his wife, and lived a dissolute life in London with the\r\nsister of Cutting Ball, a thief who ended his days at Tyburn, as his\r\nmistress. By her he had a base-born son, Fortunatus. He does not seem\r\nto have been long in London before he ‘had wholly betaken me to the\r\npenning of plays which was my continual exercise’.[664] His adoption\r\nof his profession seems to be described in _The Groats-worth of Wit_.\r\nRoberto meets a player, goes with him, and soon becomes ‘famozed\r\nfor an arch-plaimaking poet’.[665] Similarly, in _Never Too Late_,\r\nFrancesco ‘fell in amongst a company of players, who persuaded him to\r\ntry his wit in writing of comedies, tragedies, or pastorals, and if he\r\ncould perform anything worthy of the stage, then they would largely\r\nreward him for his pains’. Hereupon Francesco ‘writ a comedy, which so\r\ngenerally pleased the audience that happy were those actors in short\r\ntime, that could get any of his works, he grew so exquisite in that\r\nfaculty’.[666] Greene’s early dramatic efforts seem to have brought\r\nhim into rivalry with Marlowe (q.v.). In the preface to _Perimedes the\r\nBlacksmith_ (S. R. 29 March 1588) he writes: ‘I keep my old course to\r\npalter up something in prose, using mine old poesie still, Omne tulit\r\npunctum, although lately two Gentlemen Poets made two mad men of Rome\r\nbeat it out of their paper bucklers: and had it in derision for that I\r\ncould not make my verses jet upon the stage in tragical buskins, every\r\nword filling the mouth like the faburden of Bo-Bell, daring God out\r\nof heaven with that Atheist _Tamburlan_, or blaspheming with the mad\r\npriest of the Sun.... Such mad and scoffing poets that have poetical\r\nspirits, as bred of Merlin’s race, if there be any in England that set\r\nthe end of scholarism in an English blank-verse, I think either it is\r\nthe humour of a novice that tickles them with self-love, or too much\r\nfrequenting the hot-house (to use the German proverb) hath sweat out\r\nall the greatest part of their wits.... I but answer in print what\r\nthey have offered on the stage.’[667] The references here to Marlowe\r\nare unmistakable. His fellow ‘gentleman poet’ is unknown; but the\r\n‘mad priest of the Sun’ suggests the play of ‘the lyfe and deathe of\r\nHeliogabilus’, entered on S. R. to John Danter on 19 June 1594, but now\r\nlost.[668] In 1589 Greene published his _Menaphon_ (S. R. 23 Aug.),\r\nin which he further alluded to Marlowe as the teller of ‘a Canterbury\r\ntale; some prophetical full-mouth that as he were a Cobler’s eldest\r\nson, would by the last tell where anothers shoe wrings’.[669] Doron,\r\nin the same story, appears to parody a passage in the anonymous play\r\nof _The Taming of A Shrew_, which is further alluded to in a prefatory\r\nepistle _To the Gentlemen Students of Both Universities_ contributed to\r\nGreene’s book by Thomas Nashe. Herein Nashe, while praising Peele and\r\nhis _Arraignment of Paris_, satirizes Marlowe, Kyd, and particularly\r\nthe players (cf. App. C, No. xlii). To _Menaphon_ are also prefixed\r\nlines by Thomas Brabine which tells the ‘wits’ that ‘strive to thunder\r\nfrom a stage-man’s throat’ how the novel is beyond them. ‘Players,\r\navaunt!’[670] In the following year, 1590, Greene continued the attack\r\non the players in the autobiographic romance, already referred to,\r\nof _Never Too Late_ (cf. App. C, No. xliii). In 1590 Greene, whose\r\npublications had hitherto been mainly toys of love and romance, began\r\na series of moral pamphlets, full of professions of repentance and\r\ndenunciations of villainy. To these belong, as well as _Never Too\r\nLate_, _Greene’s Mourning Garment_ (1590) and _Greene’s Farewell\r\nto Folly_ (1591). A preface to the latter contains some satirical\r\nreferences to the anonymous play of _Fair Em_ (cf. ch. xxiv.) One R. W.\r\nretorted upon Greene in a pamphlet called _Martine Mar-Sextus_ (S. R. 8\r\nNov. 1591), in which he abuses lascivious authors who finally ‘put on a\r\nmourning garment and cry Farewell’.[671] Similarly, Greene’s exposures\r\nof ‘cony-catching’ or ‘sharping’ provoked the following passage in\r\nthe _Defence of Cony-catching_ (S. R. 21 April 1592) by one Cuthbert\r\nConycatcher: ‘What if I should prove you a cony-catcher, Master R. G.,\r\nwould it not make you blush at the matter?... Ask the Queen’s players\r\nif you sold them not Orlando Furioso for twenty nobles, and when they\r\nwere in the country sold the same play to the Lord Admiral’s men for\r\nas many more.... I hear, when this was objected, that you made this\r\nexcuse; that there was no more faith to be held with players than with\r\nthem that valued faith at the price of a feather; for as they were\r\ncomedians to act, so the actions of their lives were camelion-like;\r\nthat they were uncertain, variable, time-pleasers, men that measured\r\nhonesty by profit, and that regarded their authors not by desert but\r\nby necessity of time.’[672] It is probable that the change in the tone\r\nof Greene’s writings did not correspond to any very thorough-going\r\nreformation of life. There is nothing to show that Greene had any share\r\nin the Martinist controversy. But he became involved in one of the\r\npersonal animosities to which it led. Richard Harvey, the brother of\r\nGabriel, in his _Lamb of God_ (S. R. 23 Oct. 1589), while attacking\r\nLyly as Paphatchet, had ‘mistermed all our other poets and writers\r\nabout London, piperly make-plaies and make-bates. Hence Greene, beeing\r\nchiefe agent for the companie [i.e. the London poets] (for hee writ\r\nmore than foure other, how well I will not say: but _sat citò, si\r\nsat benè_) tooke occasion to canuaze him a little.’[673] Apparently\r\nhe called the Harveys, in his _A Quip for an Upstart Courtier_ (S.\r\nR. 21 July 1592, cf. App. C, No. xlvii), the sons of a ropemaker,\r\nwhich is what they were.[674] In August Greene partook freely of\r\nRhenish wine and pickled herrings at a supper with Nashe and one Will\r\nMonox, and fell into a surfeit. On 3 September he died in a squalid\r\nlodging, after writing a touching letter to his deserted wife, and\r\nbegging his landlady, Mrs. Isam, to lay a wreath of bays upon him.\r\nThese details are recorded by Gabriel Harvey, who visited the place\r\nand wrote an account of his enemy’s end in a letter to a friend, which\r\nhe published in his _Four Letters and Certain Sonnets: especially\r\nTouching Robert Greene, and Other Parties by him Abused_ (S. R. 4\r\nDec. 1592).[675] This brought Nashe upon him in the _Strange News of\r\nthe Intercepting of Certain Letters_[676] (S. R. 12 Jan. 1593) and\r\nbegan a controversy between the two which lasted for several years. In\r\n_Pierce’s Supererogation_ (27 Apr. 1593) Harvey spoke of ‘Nash, the ape\r\nof Greene, Greene the ape of Euphues, Euphues the ape of Envy’, and\r\ndeclared that Nashe ‘shamefully and odiously misuseth every friend or\r\nacquaintance as he hath served ... Greene, Marlowe, Chettle, and whom\r\nnot?’[677] In _Have With You to Saffron Walden_ (1596), Nashe defends\r\nhimself against these accusations. ‘I never abusd Marloe, Greene,\r\nChettle in my life.... He girds me with imitating of Greene.... I\r\nscorne it ... hee subscribing to me in anything but plotting Plaies,\r\nwherein he was his crafts master.’[678] The alleged abuse of Marlowe,\r\nGreene, and Chettle belongs to the history of another pamphlet. This is\r\n_Green’s Groats-worth of Wit, Bought with a Million of Repentance_ (S.\r\nR. 20 Sept. 1592, ‘upon the peril of Henry Chettle’[679]). According\r\nto the title-page, it was ‘written before his death and published at\r\nhis dying request’. To this is appended the famous address _To those\r\nGentlemen, his Quondam Acquaintance, that spend their wits in making\r\nPlays_.[680] The reference here to Shakespeare is undeniable. Of the\r\nthree playwrights warned, the first and third are almost certainly\r\nMarlowe and Peele; the third may be Lodge, but on the whole is far more\r\nlikely to be Nashe (q.v.). It appears, however, that Nashe himself was\r\nsupposed to have had a hand in the authorship. Chettle did his best\r\nto take the responsibility off Nashe’s shoulders in the preface to\r\nhis _Kind-Hart’s Dream_ (S. R. 8 Dec. 1592; cf. App. C, No. xlix). In\r\nthe epistle prefixed to the second edition of _Pierce Penniless his\r\nSupplication to the Devil_ (_Works_, i. 154), written early in 1593,\r\nNashe denies the charge for himself and calls _The Groats-worth_ ‘a\r\nscald trivial lying pamphlet’; and it is perhaps to this that Harvey\r\nrefers as abuse of Greene, Marlowe, and Chettle, although it is not\r\nclear how Marlowe comes in. There is an echo of Greene’s hit at the\r\n‘upstart crow, beautified with our feathers’ in the lines of R. B.,\r\n_Greene’s Funerals_ (1594, ed. McKerrow, 1911, p. 81):\r\n\r\n    Greene, gaue the ground, to all that wrote upon him.\r\n    Nay more the men, that so eclipst his fame:\r\n    Purloynde his plumes, can they deny the same?\r\n\r\nIt should be added that the theory that Greene himself was actor as\r\nwell as playwright rests on a misinterpretation of a phrase of Harvey’s\r\nand is inconsistent with the invariable tone of his references to the\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1831.

G. _Thomas Creede_.\r\n\r\nThere is general agreement that, on grounds of style, this should be\r\nthe earliest of Greene’s extant plays. In IV. 1444 is an allusion to\r\n‘mighty Tamberlaine’, and the play reads throughout like an attempt to\r\nemulate the success of Marlowe’s play of 1587 (?). In IV. i Mahomet\r\nspeaks out of a brazen head. The play may therefore be alluded to in\r\nthe ‘Mahomet’s poo [pow]’ of Peele’s (q.v.) _Farewell_ of April 1589,\r\nalthough Peele may have intended his own lost play of _The Turkish\r\nMahomet and Hiren the Fair Greek_. There is no reference in _Alphonsus_\r\nto the Armada of 1588. On the whole, the winter of 1587 appears the\r\nmost likely date for it, and if so, it is possibly the play whose ill\r\nsuccess is recorded by Greene in the preface to _Perimedes_ (1588).\r\nThe Admiral’s revived a _Mahomet_ on 16 Aug. 1594, inventoried ‘owld\r\nMahemetes head’ in 1598, and revived the play again in Aug. 1601,\r\nbuying the book from Alleyn, who might have brought it from Strange’s,\r\nor bought it from the Queen’s (Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 167; _Henslowe\r\nPapers_, 116). Collins dates _Alphonsus_ in 1591, on a theory,\r\ninconsistent with the biographical indications of the pamphlets,\r\nthat Greene’s play-writing did not begin much before that year. A\r\n‘Tragicomoedia von einem Königk in Arragona’ played at Dresden in 1626\r\nmight be either this play or _Mucedorus_ (Herz, 66, 78).\r\n\r\n          _A Looking Glass for London and England. c. 1590_\r\n\r\n                             _With_ Lodge.\r\n\r\n_S.

S. Farmer (1914, _S. F. T._).\r\n\r\nThe facts of Lodge’s (q.v.) life leave 1588, before the Canaries\r\nvoyage, or 1589–91, between that voyage and Cavendish’s expedition,\r\nas possible dates for the play. In favour of the former is Lodge’s\r\nexpressed intention in 1589 to give up ‘penny-knave’s delight’. On\r\nthe other hand, the subject is closely related to that of Greene’s\r\nmoral pamphlets, the series of which begins in 1590, and the fall of\r\nNineveh is referred to in _The Mourning Garment_ of that year. Fleay,\r\nii. 54, and Collins, i. 137, accept 1590 as the date of the play.\r\nGayley, 405, puts it in 1587, largely on the impossible notion that\r\nits ‘priest of the sun’ (IV. iii. 1540) is that referred to in the\r\n_Perimedes_ preface, but partly also from the absence of any reference\r\nto the Armada. It is possible that ‘pleasing Alcon’ in Spenser’s _Colin\r\nClout’s Come Home Again_ (1591) may refer to Lodge as the author of\r\nthe character Alcon in this play. _The Looking Glass_ was revived by\r\nStrange’s men on 8 March 1592. The clown is sometimes called Adam in\r\nthe course of the dialogue (ll. 1235 sqq., 1589 sqq., 2120 sqq.), and\r\na comparison with _James IV_ suggests that the original performer was\r\nJohn Adams of the Queen’s men, from whom Henslowe may have acquired\r\nthe play. Fleay, ii. 54, and Gayley, 405, make attempts to distinguish\r\nGreene’s share from Lodge’s, but do not support their results by\r\narguments. Crawford, _England’s Parnassus_, xxxii, 441, does not regard\r\nAllot’s ascription of the passages he borrowed to Greene and Lodge\r\nrespectively as trustworthy. Unnamed English actors played a ‘comedia\r\nauss dem propheten Jona’ at Nördlingen in 1605 (Herz, 78).\r\n\r\n               _Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_, _c. 1589_\r\n\r\n_S.

B._\r\n(1866, _Thorn diss._).\r\n\r\nFleay, in _Appendix B_ to Ward’s ed., argues from I. i. 137, ‘next\r\nFriday is S. James’, that the date of the play is 1589, in which year\r\nSt. James’s Day fell on a Friday. This does not seem to me a very\r\nreliable argument. Probably the play followed not long after Marlowe’s\r\n_Doctor Faustus_ (q.v.), itself probably written in 1588–9. The date of\r\n1589, which Ward, i. 396, and Gayley, 411, accept, is likely enough.\r\nCollins prefers 1591–2, and notes (ii. 4) a general resemblance in tone\r\nand theme to _Fair Em_, but there is nothing to indicate the priority\r\nof either play, and no charge of plagiarism in the pamphlets (_vide\r\nsupra_) to which _Fair Em_ gave rise. _Friar Bacon_ was revived by\r\nStrange’s men on 19 Feb. 1592, and again by the Queen’s and Sussex’s\r\nmen together on 1 April 1594. Doubtless it was Henslowe’s property,\r\nas Middleton wrote a prologue and epilogue for a performance by the\r\nAdmiral’s men at Court at Christmas 1602 (Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 149).\r\n\r\n                      _Orlando Furioso. c. 1591_\r\n\r\n[_MS._] The Dulwich MSS. contain an actor’s copy with cues of Orlando’s\r\npart.

R._).\r\n\r\nThe Armada (1588) is referred to in I. i. 87. Two passages are common\r\nto the play and Peele’s _Old Wive’s Tale_ (before 1595), and were\r\nprobably borrowed by Peele with the name Sacripant, which Greene got\r\nfrom Ariosto. The play cannot be the ‘King Charlemagne’ of Peele’s\r\n(q.v.) _Farewell_ (April 1589), as Charlemagne does not appear in\r\nit. The appearance of Sir John Harington’s translation of Ariosto’s\r\n_Orlando Furioso_ in 1591 suggests that as a likely date. This also\r\nwould fit the story (_vide supra_) of the second sale to the Admiral’s\r\nmen, when the Queen’s ‘were in the country’ (cf. vol. ii, p. 112).\r\nStrange’s men played _Orlando_ for Henslowe on 22 Feb. 1592. Collins,\r\ni. 217, seems to accept 1591 as the date, but Fleay, i. 263, Ward, i.\r\n395, and Gayley, 409, prefer 1588–9. So does Greg (_Henslowe_, ii.\r\n150) on the assumption that _Old Wive’s Tale_ (q.v.) ‘must belong to\r\n1590’. A ‘Comoedia von Orlando Furioso’ was acted at Dresden in 1626\r\n(Herz, 66, 77).\r\n\r\n                      _James the Fourth. c. 1591_\r\n\r\n_S.

R._).--_Dissertation_: W.\r\nCreizenach, _Zu G.’s J. IV_ (1885, _Anglia_, viii. 419).\r\n\r\nThere is very little to date the play. Its comparative merit perhaps\r\njustifies placing it, as Greene’s maturest drama, in 1591. Collins, i.\r\n44, agrees; but Fleay, i. 265; Ward, i. 400; Gayley, 415, prefer 1590.\r\nFleay finds traces of a second hand, whom he believes to be Lodge, but\r\nhe is not convincing. In l. 2269 the name Adam appears for Oberon in a\r\nstage-direction, which, when compared with _A Looking-Glass_, suggests\r\nthat the actor was John Adams of the Queen’s.\r\n\r\n                              _Lost Play_\r\n\r\nWarburton’s list of burnt plays (_3 Library_, ii. 231) contains the\r\nduplicate entries ‘His^t of Jobe by Rob. Green’ and ‘The Trag^d of\r\nJobe. Good.’ Greg suggests a confusion with Sir Robert Le Grys, who\r\nappears in the list as ‘S^r Rob. le Green’.\r\n\r\nThe statement that Greene had a share in a play on Henry VIII\r\n(_Variorum_, xix. 500) seems to be based on a confusion with a Robert\r\nGreene named by Stowe as an authority for his _Annales_ (Collins, i.\r\n69).\r\n\r\n                           _Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nGreene’s hand has been sought in _Contention of York and Lancaster_,\r\n_Edward III_, _Fair Em_, _George a Greene_, _Troublesome Reign of King\r\nJohn_, _Knack to Know a Knave_, _Thracian Wonder_, _Leire_, _Locrine_,\r\n_Mucedorus_, _Selimus_, _Taming of A Shrew_, _Thomas Lord Cromwell_\r\n(cf. ch. xxiv), and Shakespeare’s _Titus Andronicus_ and _Henry VI_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFULKE GREVILLE, LORD BROOKE (_c._ 1554–1628).\r\n\r\nGreville’s father, Sir Fulke, was a cadet of the Grevilles of Milcote,\r\nand held great estates in Warwickshire. The son was born at Beauchamp\r\nCourt ten years before he entered Shrewsbury School on 17 Oct. 1564\r\nwith Philip Sidney, of whom he wrote, _c._ 1610–12, a _Life_ (ed.\r\nNowell Smith, 1907). In 1568 he went to Jesus College, Cambridge, and\r\nfrom 1577 was a courtier in high favour with Elizabeth, and entrusted\r\nwith minor diplomatic and administrative tasks. He took part in the\r\ngreat tilt of 15 May 1581 (cf. ch. xxiv) and was a steady patron of\r\nlearning and letters. His own plays were for the closet. He was\r\nknighted in 1597. James granted him Warwick Castle in 1605, but he was\r\nno friend of Robert Cecil, and took no great part in affairs until\r\n1614, when he became Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1621 he was\r\ncreated Lord Brooke. On 1 Sept. 1628 he was stabbed to death by his\r\nservant Ralph Haywood. D. Lloyd, _Statesmen of England_ (1665), 504,\r\nmakes him claim to have been ‘master’ to Shakespeare and Jonson.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n_S.

He was Master of the Game at the Grand Christmas of\r\n1561, and the mask to which he is said to have owed his introduction\r\nto Elizabeth’s favour was probably that which the revellers took to\r\nCourt, together with Norton (q.v.) and Sackville’s _Gorboduc_ on 18\r\nJan. 1562. He became a Gentleman Pensioner in 1564, Gentleman of the\r\nPrivy Chamber, Captain of the Guard in 1572, Vice-Chamberlain and\r\nPrivy Councillor in 1578, when he was knighted, and Lord Chancellor\r\non 25 April 1587. He was conspicuous at Court in masks and tilts, and\r\nis reported, even as Lord Chancellor, to have laid aside his gown and\r\ndanced at the wedding of his nephew and heir, Sir William Newport,\r\nalias Hatton, to Elizabeth Gawdy at Holdenby in June 1590.\r\n\r\nHis only contribution to the drama is as writer of an act of _Gismond\r\nof Salerne_ at the Inner Temple in 1568 (cf. s.v. Wilmot).\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HAUGHTON (_c._ 1575–1605).\r\n\r\nBeyond his extant work and the entries in Henslowe’s diary, in the\r\nearliest of which, on 5 Nov. 1597, he appears as ‘yonge’ Haughton,\r\nlittle is known of Haughton. Cooper, _Ath. Cantab._ ii. 399, identified\r\nhim with an alleged Oxford M.A. of the same name who was incorporated\r\nat Cambridge in 1604, but turns out to have misread the name, which is\r\n‘Langton’ (Baugh, 15). He worked for the Admiral’s during 1597–1602,\r\nand found himself in the Clink in March 1600. Baugh, 22, prints his\r\nwill, made on 6 June 1605, and proved on 20 July. He left a widow Alice\r\nand children. Wentworth Smith (q.v.) and one Elizabeth Lewes were\r\nwitnesses. He was then of Allhallows, Stainings. He cannot be traced\r\nin the parish, but the name, which in his will is Houghton, is also\r\nspelt by Henslowe Harton, Horton, Hauton, Hawton, Howghton, Haughtoun,\r\nHaulton, and Harvghton, and was common in London. He might be related\r\nto a William Houghton, saddler, who held a house in Turnmill Street in\r\n1577 (Baugh, 11), since in 1601 (_H. P._ 57) Day requested that a sum\r\ndue to Haughton and himself might be paid to ‘Will Hamton sadler’.\r\n\r\n           _Englishmen for My Money_, or _A Woman Will Have\r\n                            Her Will. 1598_\r\n\r\n_S.

Presumably the verses were written for\r\nthe visit to Ramsbury of 27–9 Aug. 1592 (cf. App. A).\r\n\r\n\r\nJASPER HEYWOOD (1535–98).\r\n\r\nTranslator of Seneca (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HEYWOOD (_c._ 1570–1641).\r\n\r\nHeywood regarded Lincolnshire as his ‘country’ and had an uncle\r\nEdmund, who had a friend Sir Henry Appleton. K. L. Bates has found\r\nEdmund Heywood’s will of 7 Oct. 1624 in which Thomas Heywood and\r\nhis wife are mentioned, and has shown it to be not improbable that\r\nEdmund was the son of Richard Heywood, a London barrister who had\r\nmanors in Lincolnshire. If so, Thomas was probably the son of Edmund’s\r\ndisinherited elder brother Christopher who was aged 30 in 1570. And if\r\nRichard Heywood is the same who appears in the circle of Sir Thomas\r\nMore, a family connexion with the dramatist John Heywood may be\r\nconjectured. The date of Thomas’s birth is unknown, but he tells us\r\nthat he was at Cambridge, although a tradition that he became Fellow\r\nof Peterhouse cannot be confirmed, and is therefore not likely to have\r\nbegun his stage career before the age of 18 or thereabouts. Perhaps\r\nwe may conjecture that he was born _c._ 1570, for a Thomas Heywood is\r\ntraceable in the St. Saviour’s, Southwark, token-books from 1588 to\r\n1607, and children of Thomas Heywood ‘player’ were baptized in the\r\nsame parish from 28 June 1590 to 5 Sept. 1605 (Collier, in _Bodl. MS._\r\n29445). This is consistent with his knowledge (App. C, No. lvii) of\r\nTarlton, but not of earlier actors. He may, therefore, so far as dates\r\nare concerned, easily have written _The Four Prentices_ as early as\r\n1592; but that he in fact did so, as well as his possible contributions\r\nto the Admiral’s repertory of 1594–7, are matters of inference (cf.\r\nGreg, _Henslowe_, ii. 284). The editors of the _Apology for Actors_\r\n(Introd. v) say that in his _Funeral Elegy upon James I_ (1625) he\r\nclaims to have been ‘the theatrical servant of the Earl of Southampton,\r\nthe patron of Shakespeare’. I have never seen the Elegy. It is not in\r\nthe B. M., but a copy passed from the Bindley to the Brown collection.\r\nThere is no other evidence that Southampton ever had a company of\r\nplayers. The first dated notice of Heywood is in a payment of Oct.\r\n1596 on behalf of the Admiral’s ‘for Hawodes bocke’. On 25 March 1598\r\nhe bound himself to Henslowe for two years as an actor, doubtless for\r\nthe Admiral’s, then in process of reconstitution. Between Dec. 1598\r\nand Feb. 1599 he wrote two plays for this company, and then disappears\r\nfrom their records. He was not yet out of his time with Henslowe, but\r\nif _Edward IV_ is really his, he may have been enabled to transfer his\r\nservices to Derby’s men, who seem to have established themselves in\r\nLondon in the course of 1599. By the autumn of 1602 he was a member\r\nof Worcester’s, for whom he had probably already written _How a Man\r\nmay Choose a Good Wife from a Bad_. He now reappears in Henslowe’s\r\ndiary both as actor and as playwright. On 1 Sept, he borrowed 2_s._\r\n6_d._ to buy garters, and between 4 Sept, and 6 March 1603 he wrote\r\nor collaborated in not less than seven plays for the company. During\r\nthe same winter he also helped in one play for the Admiral’s. It seems\r\nprobable that some of his earlier work was transferred to Worcester’s.\r\nHe remained with them, and in succession to them Queen Anne’s, until\r\nthe company broke up soon after the death of the Queen in 1619. Very\r\nlittle of his work got into print. Of the twelve plays at most which\r\nappeared before 1619, the first seven were unauthorized issues; from\r\n1608 onwards, he himself published five with prefatory epistles.\r\nAbout this date, perhaps in the enforced leisure of plague-time, he\r\nalso began to produce non-dramatic works, both in prose and verse,\r\nof which the _Apology for Actors_, published in 1612, but written\r\nsome years earlier (cf. App. C, No. lvii), is the most important. The\r\nloss of his _Lives of All the Poets_, apparently begun _c._ 1614 and\r\nnever finished, is irreparable. After 1619 Heywood is not traceable\r\nat all as an actor; nor for a good many years, with the exception\r\nof one play, _The Captives_, for the Lady Elizabeth’s in 1624, as a\r\nplaywright, either on the stage or in print. In 1623 a Thomas Heywarde\r\nlived near Clerkenwell Hill (_Sh.-Jahrbuch_, xlvi. 345) and is probably\r\nthe dramatist. In 1624 he claims in the Epistle to _Gynaikeion_ the\r\nrenewed patronage of the Earl of Worcester, since ‘I was your creature,\r\nand amongst other your servants, you bestowed me upon the excellent\r\nprincesse Q. Anne ... but by her lamented death, your gift is returned\r\nagaine into your hands’. But about 1630 he emerges again. Old plays of\r\nhis were revived and new ones produced both by Queen Henrietta’s men\r\nat the Cockpit and the King’s at the Globe and Blackfriars. He wrote\r\nthe Lord Mayor’s pageants for a series of years. He sent ten more\r\nplays to the press, and included a number of prologues, epilogues,\r\nand complimentary speeches of recent composition in his _Pleasant\r\nDialogues and Dramas_ of 1637. This period lies outside my survey. I\r\nhave dealt with all plays in which there is a reasonable prospect of\r\nfinding early work, but have not thought it necessary to discuss _The\r\nEnglish Traveller_, or _A Maidenhead Well Lost_, merely because of\r\ntenuous attempts by Fleay to connect them with lost plays written for\r\nWorcester’s or still earlier anonymous work for the Admiral’s, any\r\nmore than _The Fair Maid of the West_, _The Late Lancashire Witches_,\r\nor _A Challenge for Beauty_, with regard to which no such suggestion\r\nis made. As to _Love’s Mistress_, see the note on _Pleasant Dialogues\r\nand Dramas_. The Epistle to _The English Traveller_ (1633) is worth\r\nquoting. Heywood describes the play as ‘one reserued amongst two\r\nhundred and twenty, in which I haue had either an entire hand, or\r\nat the least a maine finger’, and goes on to explain why his pieces\r\nhave not appeared as _Works_. ‘One reason is, that many of them by\r\nshifting and change of Companies, haue beene negligently lost, Others\r\nof them are still retained in the hands of some Actors, who thinke\r\nit against their peculiar profit to haue them come in Print, and a\r\nthird, That it neuer was any great ambition in me, to bee in this kind\r\nVolumniously read.’ Heywood’s statement would give him an average of\r\nover five plays a year throughout a forty years’ career, and even if\r\nwe assume that he included every piece which he revised or supplied\r\nwith a prologue, it is obvious that the score or so plays that we have\r\nand the dozen or so others of which we know the names must fall very\r\nshort of his total output. ‘Tho. Heywood, Poet’, was buried at St.\r\nJames’s, Clerkenwell, on 16 Aug. 1641 (_Harl. Soc. Reg._ xvii. 248),\r\nand therefore the alleged mention of him as still alive in _The Satire\r\nagainst Separatists_ (1648) must rest on a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1842–51.

The Epistle speaks of the play as written ‘many\r\nyeares since, in my infancy of iudgment in this kinde of poetry,\r\nand my first practice’ and ‘some fifteene or sixteene yeares agoe’.\r\nThis would, by itself, suggest a date shortly after the publication\r\nof Fairfax’s translation from Tasso under the title of _Godfrey of\r\nBulloigne, or The Recouerie of Ierusalem_ in 1600. But the Epistle\r\nalso refers to a recent revival of ‘the commendable practice of long\r\nforgotten armes’ in ‘the Artillery Garden’. This, according to Stowe,\r\n_Annales_ (1615), 906, was in 1610, which leads Fleay, i. 182, followed\r\nby Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 166), to assume that the Epistle was written\r\nfor an edition, now lost, of about that date. In support they cite\r\nBeaumont’s _K. B. P._ iv. 1 (dating it 1610 instead of 1607), ‘Read\r\nthe play of the _Foure Prentices of London_, where they tosse their\r\npikes so’. Then, calculating back sixteen years, they arrive at the\r\nanonymous _Godfrey of Bulloigne_ produced by the Admiral’s on 19 July\r\n1594, and identify this with _The Four Prentices_, in which Godfrey\r\nis a character. But this _Godfrey of Bulloigne_ was a second part,\r\nand it is difficult to suppose that the first part was anything but\r\nthe play entered on the S. R. earlier in 1594. This, from its title,\r\nclearly left no room for a second part covering the same ground as _The\r\nFour Prentices_, which ends with the capture of Jerusalem. If then\r\nHeywood’s play is as old as 1594 at all, it must be identified with\r\nthe first part of _Godfrey of Bulloigne_. And is not this in its turn\r\nlikely to be the _Jerusalem_ played by Strange’s men on 22 March and\r\n25 April 1592? If so, Heywood’s career began very early, and, as we\r\ncan hardly put his Epistle earlier than the opening of the Artillery\r\nGarden in 1610, his ‘fifteene or sixteene yeares’ must be rather an\r\nunderstatement. There is of course nothing in the Epistle itself to\r\nsuggest that the play had been previously printed, but we know from the\r\nEpistle to _Lucrece_ that the earliest published plays by Heywood were\r\nsurreptitious.\r\n\r\nGreg, _Henslowe_, ii. 230, hesitatingly suggests that a purchase by\r\nWorcester’s of ‘iiij lances for the comody of Thomas Hewedes & M^r.\r\nSmythes’ on 3 Sept. 1602 may have been for a revival of _The Four\r\nPrentices_, ‘where they tosse their pikes so’, transferred from the\r\nAdmiral’s. But I think his afterthought, that the comedy was Heywood\r\nand Smith’s _Albere Galles_, paid for on the next day, is sound.\r\n\r\n                       _Sir Thomas Wyatt. 1602_\r\n\r\nSee s.v.

An anonymous Marshal is a leading character, and the\r\nidentification by Fleay, i. 300, with the _Marshal Osric_ written\r\nby Heywood and Smith for Worcester’s in Sept. 1602 is not the worst of\r\nhis guesses.\r\n\r\n                 _A Woman Killed With Kindness. 1603_\r\n\r\n1607.

The approximate date is accepted by Ward, ii. 574, and\r\nothers. It may be added that there are obvious parallelisms with\r\nthe anonymous _How a Man may Choose a Good Wife from a Bad_ (1602)\r\ngenerally assigned to Heywood.\r\n\r\n              _If You Know not Me, You Know Nobody. 1605_\r\n\r\n_S.

As the play\r\npassed to the Cockpit, it was presumably written for Queen Anne’s. Greg\r\n(_Henslowe_, ii. 223) rightly resists the suggestion that it was the\r\nold _Philip of Spain_ bought by the Admiral’s from Alleyn in 1602. It\r\nis only Part i which has characteristics attributable to stenography,\r\nand this remained unrevised. According to Van Dam and Stoffel, the 1606\r\nand 1632 editions of Part ii represent the same original text, in the\r\nfirst case shortened for representation, in the second altered by a\r\npress-corrector.\r\n\r\n                _Fortune by Land and Sea. c. 1607_ (?)\r\n\r\n                           _With_ W.

R. 15 Aug. 1586) dealing with Elizabethan piracy.\r\nRowley’s co-operation suggests the date 1607–9 when he was writing for\r\nQueen Anne’s men, and other trifling evidence (Aronstein, 237) makes\r\nsuch a date plausible.\r\n\r\n                   _The Rape of Lucrece. 1603 < > 8_\r\n\r\n_S.

The play was given at\r\nCourt, apparently by the King’s and Queen’s men together, on 13 Jan.\r\n1612. The Epistle says that it has not been Heywood’s custom ‘to commit\r\nmy Playes to the Presse’, like others who ‘have used a double sale of\r\ntheir labours, first to the Stage, and after to the Presse’. He now\r\ndoes so because ‘some of my Playes have (unknowne to me, and without\r\nany of my direction) accidentally come into the Printers hands (and\r\ntherefore so corrupt and mangled, copied only by the eare) that I have\r\nbeene as unable to knowe them, as ashamed to challenge them’. A play on\r\nthe subject seems to have been on tour in Germany in 1619 (Herz, 98).\r\n_The Rape of Lucrece_ was on the Cockpit stage in 1628, according to a\r\nnewsletter in _Athenaeum_ (1879), ii. 497, and to the 1638 edition are\r\nappended songs ‘added by the stranger that lately acted Valerius his\r\npart’. It is in the Cockpit list of plays in 1639 (_Variorum_, iii.\r\n159).\r\n\r\n                        _The Golden Age > 1611_\r\n\r\n_S. R._ 1611, Oct. 14 (Buck).

It came to the press\r\n‘accidentally’, but Heywood, ‘at length hauing notice thereof’,\r\nprefaced it, as it had ‘already past the approbation of auditors’.\r\nFleay, i. 283, followed hesitatingly by Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 175),\r\nthinks it a revision of the _Olympo_ or _Seleo & Olempo_, which he\r\ninterprets _Coelo et Olympo_, produced by the Admiral’s on 5 March\r\n1595. The Admiral’s inventories show that they had a play with Neptune\r\nin it, but it is only at the very end of _The Golden Age_ that the\r\nsons of Saturn draw lots and Jupiter wins Heaven or Olympus. Fleay’s\r\nassumption that the play was revised _c._ 1610, because of Dekker,\r\n_If it be not Good_, i. 1, ‘The Golden Age is moulding new again’, is\r\nequally hazardous.\r\n\r\n                        _The Silver Age > 1612_\r\n\r\n1613.

It may be so. But the\r\ntext presumably represents the play as given at Court, apparently by\r\nthe King’s and Queen’s men together, on 12 Jan. 1612.

G. Martin, _A New Specimen of the Revenge Play_\r\n(1918, _M.

This, however, was in 1632, and I can only read the\r\nEpistles to the earlier _Ages_ as indicating that the _Iron Age_ was\r\ncontemplated, but not yet in existence, up to 1613. I should therefore\r\nput the play _c._ 1613, and take the three theatres at which it was\r\ngiven to be the Curtain, Red Bull, and Cockpit. Fleay, i. 285, thinks\r\nthat Part i was the anonymous _Troy_ produced by the Admiral’s on 22\r\nJune 1596. More plausible is the conjecture of Greg (_Henslowe_, ii.\r\n180) that this was ‘an earlier and shorter version later expanded into\r\nthe two-part play’. Spencer had a play on the Destruction of Troy at\r\nNuremberg in 1613 (Herz, 66).\r\n\r\n              _Pleasant Dialogues and Dramas. 1630–6_ (?)\r\n\r\n_S.

Bang (1903, _Materialien_, iii).\r\n\r\nThe section called ‘Sundry Fancies writ upon severall occasions’ (Bang,\r\n231) includes a number of Prologues and Epilogues, of which those which\r\nare datable fall between 1630 and 1636. Bang regards all the contents\r\nof the volume as of about this period. Fleay, i. 285, had suggested\r\nthat _Deorum Judicium_, _Jupiter and Io_, _Apollo and Daphne_,\r\n_Amphrisa_, and possibly _Misanthropos_ formed the anonymous _Five\r\nPlays in One_ produced by the Admiral’s on 7 April 1597, and also that\r\n_Misanthropos_, which he supposed to bear the name _Time’s Triumph_,\r\nwas played with _Faustus_ on 13 April 1597 and carelessly entered by\r\nHenslowe as ‘times triumpe & fortus’. Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 183) says\r\nof the _Dialogues and Dramas_, ‘many of the pieces in that collection\r\nare undoubtedly early’. He rejects Fleay’s views as to _Misanthropos_\r\non the grounds that it is ‘unrelieved tediousness’ and has no claim to\r\nthe title _Time’s Triumph_, and is doubtful as to _Deorum Judicium_.\r\nThe three others he seems inclined to accept as possibly belonging to\r\nthe 1597 series, especially _Jupiter and Io_, where the unappropriated\r\nhead of Argus in one of the Admiral’s inventories tempts him. He is\r\nalso attracted by an alternative suggestion of Fleay’s that one of the\r\n_Five Plays in One_ may have been a _Cupid and Psyche_, afterwards\r\nworked up into _Love’s Mistress_ (1636). This he says, ‘if it existed’,\r\nwould suit very well. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that it\r\ndid exist. Moreover, P. A. Daniel has shown that certain lines found\r\nin _Love’s Mistress_ are assigned to Dekker in _England’s Parnassus_\r\n(1600, ed. Crawford, xxxi. 509, 529) and must be from the _Cupid and\r\nPsyche_ produced by the Admiral’s _c._ June 1600 (_Henslowe_, ii. 212).\r\nThere is no indication that Heywood collaborated with Dekker, Chettle,\r\nand Day in this; but it occurs to me that, if he was still at the Rose,\r\nhe may have acted in the play and cribbed years afterwards from the\r\nmanuscript of his part. I will only add that _Misanthropos_ and _Deorum\r\nJudicium_ seem to me out of the question. They belong to the series of\r\n‘dialogues’ which Heywood in his Epistle clearly treats as distinct\r\nfrom the ‘dramas’, for after describing them he goes on, ‘For such as\r\ndelight in Stage-poetry, here are also divers Dramma’s, never before\r\npublished: Which, though some may condemne for their shortnesse, others\r\nagaine will commend for their sweetnesse’.

C. Stopes in _Athenaeum_ and\r\n_Shakespeare-Jahrbuch_ papers, and finally in _William Hunnis and the\r\nRevels of the Chapel Royal_ (1910, _Materialien_, xxix).]\r\n\r\nThe date of Hunnis’s birth is unknown, except as far as it can be\r\ninferred from the reference to him as ‘in winter of thine age’ in 1578.\r\nHe is described on the title-page of his translation of _Certayne\r\nPsalmes_ (1550) as ‘seruant’ to Sir William Herbert, who became\r\nEarl of Pembroke. He is in the lists of the Gentlemen of the Chapel\r\nabout 1553, but he took part in plots against Mary and in 1556 was\r\nsent to the Tower. He lost his post, but this was restored between\r\nElizabeth’s accession in 1558 and the opening of the extant _Cheque\r\nBook_ of the Chapel in 1561, and on 15 Nov. 1566 he was appointed\r\nMaster of the Children in succession to Richard Edwardes (q.v.). For\r\nthe history of his Mastership, cf. ch. xii (Chapel). Early in 1559 he\r\nmarried Margaret, widow of Nicholas Brigham, Teller of the Exchequer,\r\nthrough whom he acquired a life-interest in the secularized Almonry at\r\nWestminster. She died in June 1559, and about 1560 Hunnis married Agnes\r\nBlancke, widow of a Grocer. He took out the freedom of the Grocers’\r\nCompany, and had a shop in Southwark. He was elected to the livery of\r\nthe Company in 1567, but disappears from its records before 1586. In\r\n1569 he obtained a grant of arms, and is described as of Middlesex.\r\nFrom 1576–85, however, he seems to have had a house at Great Ilford,\r\nBarking, Essex. His only known child, Robin, was page to Walter Earl\r\nof Essex in Ireland, and is said in _Leicester’s Commonwealth_ to have\r\ntasted the poison with which Leicester killed Essex in 1576 and to have\r\nlost his hair. But he became a Rider of the Stable under Leicester as\r\nMaster of the Horse during 1579–83, and received payments for posting\r\nservices in later years up to 1593. In 1562 William Hunnis became\r\nKeeper of the Orchard and Gardens at Greenwich, and held this post\r\nwith his Mastership to his death. He supplied greenery and flowers\r\nfor the Banqueting Houses of 1569 and 1571 (cf. ch. i). In 1570 the\r\nQueen recommended him to the City as Taker of Tolls and Dues on London\r\nBridge, and his claim was bought off for £40. In 1583 he called\r\nattention to the poor remuneration of the Mastership, and in 1585 he\r\nreceived grants of land at Great Ilford and elsewhere. He died on 6\r\nJune 1597.\r\n\r\nHunnis published several volumes of moral and religious verse, original\r\nand translated: _Certayne Psalmes_ (1550); _A Godly new Dialogue of\r\nChrist and a Sinner_ (S. R. 1564, if this is rightly identified with\r\nthe _Dialogue_ of Hunnis’s 1583 volume); _A Hive Full of Honey_ (1578,\r\nS. R. 1 Dec. 1577, dedicated to Leicester); _A Handful of Honnisuckles_\r\n(N.D., S. R. 11 Dec. 1578, a New Year’s gift to the Ladies of the Privy\r\nChamber); _Seven Sobbes of a Sorrowful Soule for Sinne_ (1583, S. R.\r\n7 Nov. 1581, with the _Handful of Honnisuckles_, _The Widow’s Mite_,\r\nand _A Comfortable Dialogue between Christ and a Sinner_, dedicated to\r\nLady Sussex); _Hunnies Recreations_ (1588, S. R. 4 Dec. 1587, dedicated\r\nto Sir Thomas Heneage). Several poems by Hunnis are also with those of\r\nRichard Edwardes and others in _The Paradyse of Daynty Deuises_ (1567);\r\none, the _Nosegay_, in Clement Robinson’s _A Handfull of Pleasant\r\nDelites_ (1584); and it is usual to assign to him two bearing the\r\ninitials W. H., _Wodenfride’s Song in Praise of Amargana_ and _Another\r\nof the Same_, in _England’s Helicon_ (1600).\r\n\r\nThe name of no play by Hunnis has been preserved, although he may\r\nprobably enough have written some of those produced by the Chapel boys\r\nduring his Mastership. That he was a dramatist is testified to by the\r\nfollowing lines contributed by Thomas Newton, one of the translators of\r\nSeneca, to his _Hive Full of Honey_.\r\n\r\n    In prime of youth thy pleasant Penne depaincted Sonets sweete,\r\n    Delightfull to the greedy Eare, for youthfull Humour meete.\r\n    Therein appeared thy pregnant wit, and store of fyled Phraze\r\n    Enough t’ astoune the doltish Drone, and lumpish Lout amaze,\r\n    Thy Enterludes, thy gallant Layes, thy Rond’letts and thy Songes,\r\n    Thy Nosegay and thy Widowes’ Mite, with that thereto belonges....\r\n    ... Descendinge then in riper years to stuffe of further reache,\r\n    Thy schooled Quill by deeper skill did graver matters teache,\r\n    And now to knit a perfect Knot; In winter of thine age\r\n    Such argument thou chosen hast for this thy Style full sage.\r\n    As far surmounts the Residue.\r\n\r\nNewton’s account of his friend’s poetic evolution seems to assign his\r\n‘enterludes’ to an early period of mainly secular verse; but if this\r\npreceded his _Certayne Psalmes_ of 1550, which are surely of ‘graver\r\nmatters’, it must have gone back to Henry VIII’s reign, far away from\r\nhis Mastership. On the other hand, Hunnis was certainly contributing\r\nsecular verse and devices to the Kenilworth festivities (cf. s.v.\r\nGascoigne) only three years before Newton wrote. Mrs. Stopes suggests,\r\nwith some plausibility, that the Amargana songs of _England’s Helicon_\r\nmay come from an interlude. She also assigns to Hunnis, by conjecture,\r\n_Godly Queen Hester_, in which stress is laid on Hester’s Chapel Royal,\r\nand _Jacob and Esau_ (1568, S. R. 1557–8), which suggests gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEONARD HUTTEN (_c._ 1557–1632).\r\n\r\nPossibly the author of the academic _Bellum Grammaticale_ (cf.

S. Rait, _Lusus Regis_ (1901), 2, printed from _Bodleian MS._ 27843\r\nverses by James I, which he dated _c._ 1581. The occasion and correct\r\ndate are supplied by another text, with a title, in A. F. Westcott,\r\n_New Poems of James I_ (1911). The bridal pair were George Gordon,\r\n6th Earl and afterwards 1st Marquis of Huntly, and Henrietta Stuart,\r\ndaughter of Esme, Duke of Lennox. The verses consist of a hymeneal\r\ndialogue, with a preliminary invocation by the writer, and speeches by\r\nMercury, Nimphes, Agrestis, Skolar, Woman, The Vertuouse Man, Zani,\r\nThe Landvart Gentleman, The Soldat. The earlier lines seem intended to\r\naccompany a tilting at the ring or some such contest, but at l. 74 is a\r\nreference to the coming of ‘strangers in a maske’.\r\n\r\nWestcott, lviii, says that James helped William Fowler in devising a\r\nmimetic show for the banquet at the baptism of Prince Henry on 23 Aug.\r\n1594.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN JEFFERE (?-?).\r\n\r\nNothing is known of him, beyond his possible authorship of the\r\nfollowing play:\r\n\r\n                        _The Bugbears. 1563 <_\r\n\r\n[_MS._] _Lansdowne MS._ 807, f. 57. [The MS. contains the relics\r\nof John Warburton’s collection, and on a slip once attached to the\r\nfly-leaf is his famous list of burnt plays, which includes ‘Bugbear\r\nC. Jo^n. Geffrey’ (Greg in _3 Library_, ii. 232). It appears to be\r\nthe work of at least five hands, of which one, acting as a corrector,\r\nas well as a scribe, may be that of the author. The initials J. B.\r\nagainst a line or two inserted at the end do not appear to be his, but,\r\nas there was no single scribe, he may be writer of a final note to\r\nthe text, written in printing characters, ‘Soli deo honor et gloria\r\nJohannus Jeffere scribebat hoc’. This note is followed by the songs and\r\ntheir music, and at the top of the first is written ‘Giles peperel for\r\nIphiginia’. On the last page are the names ‘Thomas Ba ...’ and ‘Frances\r\nWhitton’, which probably do not indicate authorship. A title-page may\r\nbe missing, and a later hand has written at the head of the text, ‘The\r\nBuggbears’.]\r\n\r\n_Editions_ by C. Grabau (1896–7, _Archiv_, xcviii. 301; xcix. 311) and\r\nR. W. Bond (1911, _E. P. I._).--_Dissertation_: W. Dibelius (_Archiv_,\r\ncxii. 204).\r\n\r\nThe play is an adaptation of A. F. Grazzini, _La Spiritata_ (1561), and\r\nuses also material from J. Weier (_De Praestigiis Daemonum_) (1563) and\r\nfrom the life of Michel de Nôtredame (Nostradamus), not necessarily\r\nlater than his death in 1566. Bond is inclined to date the play, partly\r\non metrical grounds, about 1564 or 1565. Grabau and Dibelius suggest a\r\ndate after 1585, apparently under the impression that the name Giles\r\nin the superscription to the music may indicate the composition of\r\nNathaniel Giles, of the Chapel Royal, who took his Mus. Bac. in 1585.\r\nBut the name, whether of a composer, or of the actor of the part of\r\nIphigenia, is Giles Peperel. The performers were ‘boyes’, but the\r\ntemptation to identify the play with the _Effiginia_ shown by Paul’s at\r\nCourt on 28 Dec. 1571 is repressed by the description of _Effiginia_ in\r\nthe Revels account as a ‘tragedye’, whereas _The Bugbears_ is a comedy.\r\nMoreover, Iphigenia is not a leading part, although one added by the\r\nEnglish adapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURENCE JOHNSON (_c._ 1577).\r\n\r\nA possible author of _Misogonus_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN JONSON (1572–1637).\r\n\r\nBenjamin Johnson, or Jonson, as he took the fancy to spell his name,\r\nwas born, probably on 11 June 1572, at Westminster, after the death\r\nof his father, a minister, of Scottish origin. He was withheld, or\r\nwithdrawn, from the University education justified by his scholastic\r\nattainments at Westminster to follow his step-father’s occupation\r\nof bricklaying, and when this proved intolerable, he served as a\r\nsoldier in the Netherlands. In a prologue to _The Sad Shepherd_, left\r\nunfinished at his death in August 1637, he describes himself as ‘He\r\nthat has feasted you these forty years’, and by 1597 at latest his\r\nconnexion with the stage had begun. Aubrey tells us (ii. 12, 226) that\r\nhe ‘acted and wrote, but both ill, at the Green Curtaine, a kind of\r\nnursery or obscure play-house, somewhere in the suburbes (I thinke\r\ntowards Shoreditch or Clarkenwell)’, and again that he ‘was never a\r\ngood actor, but an excellent instructor’. The earliest contemporary\r\nrecords, however, show Jonson not at the Curtain, but on the Bankside.\r\nOn 28 July 1597 Henslowe (i. 200) recorded a personal loan to ‘Bengemen\r\nJohnson player’ of £4 ‘to be payd yt agayne when so euer ether I or any\r\nfor me shall demande yt’, and on the very same day he opened on another\r\npage of his diary (i. 47) an account headed ‘Received of Bengemenes\r\nJohnsones share as ffoloweth 1597’ and entered in it the receipt of\r\na single sum of 3_s._ 9_d._, to which no addition was ever made. Did\r\nthese entries stand alone, one would infer, on the analogy of other\r\ntransactions of Henslowe’s and from the signatures of two Admiral’s\r\nmen as witnesses to the loan, that Jonson had purchased a share in\r\nthe Admiral’s company for £4, that he borrowed the means to do this\r\nfrom Henslowe, and that Henslowe was to recoup himself by periodical\r\ndeductions from the takings of the company as they passed through his\r\nhands. But there is no other evidence that Jonson ever had an interest\r\nin the Admiral’s, and there are facts which, if one could believe that\r\nHenslowe would regard the takings of any company but the Admiral’s as\r\nsecurity for a loan, would lead to the conclusion that Jonson’s ‘share’\r\nwas with Pembroke’s men at the Swan. The day of Henslowe’s entries,\r\n28 July 1597, is the very day on which the theatres were suppressed\r\nas a result of the performance of _The Isle of Dogs_ (cf. App. D, No.\r\ncx), and it is hardly possible to doubt that Jonson was one of the\r\nactors who had a hand with Nashe (q.v.) in that play. The Privy Council\r\nregisters record his release, with Shaw and Spencer of Pembroke’s\r\nmen, from the Marshalsea on 3 Oct. 1597 (Dasent, xxviii. 33; cf. App.\r\nD, No. cxii); while Dekker in _Satiromastix_ (l. 1513) makes Horace\r\nadmit that he had played Zulziman in Paris Garden, and Tucca upbraid\r\nhim because ‘when the Stagerites banisht thee into the Ile of Dogs,\r\nthou turn’dst Bandog (villanous Guy) & ever since bitest’. The same\r\npassage confirms Aubrey’s indication that Jonson was actor, and a bad\r\nactor, as well as poet. ‘Thou putst vp a supplication’, says Tucca, ‘to\r\nbe a poor iorneyman player, and hadst beene still so, but that thou\r\ncouldst not set a good face vpon ’t: thou hast forgot how thou amblest\r\n(in leather pilch) by a play-wagon, in the high way, and took’st mad\r\nIeronimoes part, to get seruice among the mimickes.’ Elsewhere (l. 633)\r\nTucca taunts him that ‘when thou ranst mad for the death of Horatio,\r\nthou borrowedst a gowne of Roscius the stager, (that honest Nicodemus)\r\nand sentst it home lowsie’. This imprisonment for the _Isle of Dogs_\r\nis no doubt the ‘bondage’ for his ‘first error’ to which Jonson refers\r\nin writing to Salisbury about _Eastward Ho!_ in 1605, and the ‘close\r\nimprisonment, under Queen Elizabeth’, during which he told Drummond he\r\nwas beset by spies (Laing, 19). Released, Jonson borrowed 5_s._ more\r\nfrom Henslowe (i. 200) on 5 Jan. 1598, and entered into a relationship\r\nwith him and the Admiral’s as a dramatist, which lasted intermittently\r\nuntil 1602. It was broken, not only by plays for the King’s men,\r\nwhose employment of him, which may have been at the Curtain, was due,\r\naccording to Rowe, to the critical instinct of Shakespeare (H.-P.\r\nii. 74), and for the Chapel children when these were established at\r\nBlackfriars in 1600, but also by a quarrel with Gabriel Spencer, whose\r\ndeath at his hands during a duel with swords in Hoxton Fields on 22\r\nSept. 1598 was ‘harde & heavey’ news to Henslowe (_Henslowe Papers_,\r\n48) and brought Jonson to trial for murder, from which he only escaped\r\nby reading his neck-verse (Jeaffreson, _Middlesex County Records_,\r\ni. xxxviii; iv. 350; cf. Laing, 19). Jonson’s pen was critical, and\r\nto the years 1600–2 belongs the series of conflicts with other poets\r\nand with the actors generically known as the _Poetomachia_ or Stage\r\nQuarrel (cf. ch. xi). Meanwhile Jonson, perhaps encouraged by his\r\nsuccess in introducing a mask into _Cynthia’s Revels_ (1601), seems to\r\nhave conceived the ambition of becoming a Court poet. At first he was\r\nnot wholly successful, and the selection of Daniel to write the chief\r\nChristmas mask of 1603–4 appears to have provoked an antagonism between\r\nthe two poets, which shows itself in Jonson’s qualified acknowledgement\r\nto Lady Rutland of the favours done him by Lady Bedford (_Forest_, xii):\r\n\r\n            though she have a better verser got,\r\n    (Or poet, in the court-account) than I,\r\n    And who doth me, though I not him envy,\r\n\r\nand long after in the remark to Drummond (Laing, 10) that ‘Daniel was\r\nat jealousies with him’. But the mask was a form of art singularly\r\nsuited to Jonson’s genius. In the next year he came to his own, and\r\nof ten masks at Court during 1605–12 not less than eight are his.\r\nThis employment secured him a considerable vogue as a writer of\r\nentertainments and complimentary verses, and a standing with James\r\nhimself, with the Earl of Salisbury, and with other persons of honour,\r\nwhich not only brought him pecuniary profit, but also enabled him to\r\nwithstand the political attacks made upon _Sejanus_, for which he was\r\nhaled before the Council, and upon _Eastward Ho!_, for which he was\r\nonce more imprisoned. During this period he continued to write plays,\r\nwith no undue frequency, both for the King’s men and for the Queen’s\r\nRevels and their successors, the Lady Elizabeth’s. As a rule, he had\r\npublished his plays, other than those bought by Henslowe, soon after\r\nthey were produced, and in 1612 he seems to have formed the design of\r\ncollecting them, with his masks and occasional verses, into a volume\r\nof Works. Probably the design was deferred, owing to his absence in\r\nFrance as tutor to the son of Sir Walter Raleigh, from the autumn of\r\n1612 (_M. P._ xi. 279) to some date in 1613 earlier than 29 June, when\r\nhe witnessed the burning of the Globe (_M. L. R._ iv. 83). For the\r\nsame reason he took no part in the masks for the Princess Elizabeth’s\r\nwedding at Shrovetide. But he returned in time for that of the Earl of\r\nSomerset at Christmas 1613, and wrote three more masks before his folio\r\n_Works_ actually appeared in 1616. In the same year he received a royal\r\npension of 100 marks.\r\n\r\nJonson’s later life can only be briefly summarized. During a visit to\r\nScotland he paid a visit to William Drummond of Hawthornden in January\r\n1619, and of his conversation his host took notes which preserve many\r\nbiographical details and many critical utterances upon the men, books,\r\nand manners of his time. In 1621 (cf. ch. iii) he obtained a reversion\r\nof the Mastership of the Revels, which he never lived to enjoy. His\r\nmasks continued until 1631, when an unfortunate quarrel with Inigo\r\nJones brought them to an end. His play-writing, dropped after 1616,\r\nwas resumed about 1625, and to this period belong his share in _The\r\nBloody Brother_ of the Beaumont and Fletcher series, _The Staple of\r\nNews_, _The New Inn_, _The Magnetic Lady_, and _The Tale of a Tub_.\r\nIn 1637, probably on 6 August, he died. He had told Drummond ‘that\r\nthe half of his comedies were not in print’, as well as that ‘of all\r\nhis playes he never gained two hundreth pounds’ (Laing, 27, 35), and\r\nin 1631 he began the publication, by instalments, of a second volume\r\nof his Works. This was completed after his death, with the aid of Sir\r\nKenelm Digby, in 1640 and 1641. But it did not include _The Case is\r\nAltered_, the printing of which in 1609 probably lacked his authority,\r\nor the Henslowe plays, of which his manuscripts, if he had any, may\r\nhave perished when his library was burnt in 1623.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n                           _F_{1}_ (_1616_)\r\n\r\n_S.

Selin (1917, _Yale Studies_, lvi).--_Dissertation_:\r\nC. Crawford, _B. J.’s C. A.: its Date_ (1909, _10 N. Q._ xi. 41).\r\n\r\nAs Nashe, _Lenten Stuff_ (_Works_, iii. 220), which was entered in S.\r\nR. on 11 Jan. 1599, refers to ‘the merry coblers cutte in that witty\r\nplay of _the Case is altered_’, and as I. i chaffs Anthony Munday as\r\n‘in print already for the best plotter’, alluding to the description of\r\nhim in Francis Meres’s _Palladis Tamia_ (S. R. 7 Sept. 1598), the date\r\nwould seem at first sight to be closely fixed to the last few months of\r\n1598. But I. i has almost certainly undergone interpolation. Antonio\r\nBalladino, who appears in this scene alone, and whose dramatic function\r\nis confused with that later (II. vii) assigned to Valentine, is only\r\nintroduced for the sake of a satirical portrait of Munday. He is\r\n‘pageant poet to the City of Milan’, at any rate ‘when a worse cannot\r\nbe had’. He boasts that ‘I do use as much stale stuff, though I say it\r\nmyself, as any man does in that kind’, and again, ‘An they’ll give me\r\ntwenty pound a play, I’ll not raise my vein’. Some ‘will have every\r\nday new tricks, and write you nothing but humours’; this pleases the\r\ngentlemen, but he is for ‘the penny’. Crawford points out that there\r\nare four quotations from the play in Bodenham’s _Belvedere_ (1600), of\r\nwhich Munday was the compiler, and suggests that he would have left it\r\nalone had the ridicule of himself then been a part of it. I should put\r\nthe scene later still. Antonio makes an offer of ‘one of the books’\r\nof his last pageant, and as far as is known, although Munday may have\r\nbeen arranging city pageants long before, the first which he printed\r\nwas that for 1605. Nor does the reference to plays of ‘tricks’ and\r\n‘humours’ necessarily imply proximity to Jonson’s own early comedies,\r\nfor Day’s _Law Tricks_ and his _Humour out of Breath_, as well as\r\nprobably the anonymous _Every Woman in her Humour_, belong to 1604–8.\r\nMoreover, the play was certainly on the stage about this time, since\r\nthe actors are called ‘Children of Blackfriars’, although of course\r\nthis would not be inconsistent with their having first produced it when\r\nthey bore some other name. The text is in an odd state. Up to the end\r\nof Act III it has been arranged in scenes, on the principle usually\r\nadopted by Jonson; after ‘Actus 3 [an error for 4] Scaene 1’ there is\r\nno further division, and in Act V verse and prose are confused. As\r\nJonson was careful about the printing of his plays, as there is no\r\nepistle, and as _C. A._ was left out of the Ff., there is some reason\r\nto suppose that the publication in this state was not due to him. Is\r\nit possible that Day, whom Jonson described to Drummond as a ‘rogue’\r\nand a ‘base fellow’, was concerned in this transaction? It is obvious\r\nthat, if I. i is a later addition, the original production may have\r\nbeen earlier than 1598. And the original company is unknown. The mere\r\nfact that the Children of the Blackfriars revived it shortly before\r\n1609 does not in the least prove that it was originally written for\r\nthe Children of the Chapel. If Chapman’s _All Fools_ is a Blackfriars\r\nrevival of an Admiral’s play, _C. A._ might even more easily be a\r\nBlackfriars revival of a play written, say, for the extinct Pembroke’s.\r\nWith the assumption that _C. A._ was a Chapel play disappears the\r\nassumption that the Chapel themselves began their renewed dramatic\r\nactivities at a date earlier than the end of 1600. Selin shows a fair\r\namount of stylistic correspondence with Jonson’s other work, but it is\r\nquite possible that, as suggested by Herford (_R. E. C._ ii. 9), he had\r\na collaborator. If so, Chapman seems plausible.\r\n\r\n_C. A._ has nothing to do with the _Poetomachia_. Hart (_9 N. Q._ xi.\r\n501, xii. 161, 263) finds in the vocabulary of Juniper a parody of the\r\naffected phraseology of Gabriel Harvey, and in the critical attitude of\r\nValentine a foreshadowing of such autobiographical studies as that of\r\nAsper in _E. M. O._ His suggestion that the cudgel-play between Onion\r\nand Martino in II. vii represents the controversy between Nashe and\r\nMartin Marprelate is perhaps less plausible. Nashe would be very likely\r\nto think the chaff of Harvey ‘witty’.\r\n\r\n                    _Every Man In his Humour. 1598_\r\n\r\n_S.

I._ (1882,\r\n_Antiquary_, vi. 15, 106).\r\n\r\nThe date assigned by F_{1} is confirmed by an allusion (IV. iv. 15) to\r\nthe ‘fencing Burgullian’ or Burgundian, John Barrose, who challenged\r\nall fencers in that year, and was hanged for murder on 10 July (Stowe,\r\n_Annales_, 787). The production must have been shortly before 20 Sept,\r\nwhen Toby Mathew wrote to Dudley Carleton (_S. P. D. Eliz._ cclxviii.\r\n61; Simpson, ix) of an Almain who lost 300 crowns at ‘a new play\r\ncalled, Euery mans humour’. Two short passages were taken from the\r\nplay in R. Allot’s _England’s Parnassus_ (1600, ed. Crawford, xxxii.\r\n110, 112, 436) which is earlier than Q_{1}. The Q_{1} text (I. i. 184)\r\ncontains a hit at Anthony Munday in ‘that he liue in more penurie of\r\nwit and inuention, then eyther the Hall-Beadle, or Poet Nuntius’.\r\nThis has disappeared from F_{1}, which in other respects represents a\r\ncomplete revision of the Q_{1} text. Many passages have been improved\r\nfrom a literary point of view; the scene has been transferred from\r\nItaly to London and the names anglicized; the oaths have all been\r\nexpunged or softened. Fleay, i. 358, finding references to a ‘queen’ in\r\nF_{1} for the ‘duke’ of Q_{1} and an apparent dating of St. Mark’s Day\r\non a Friday, assigned the revision to 1601, and conjectured that it was\r\ndone by Jonson for the Chapel, that the Chamberlain’s published the Q\r\nin revenge, and that Jonson tried to stay it. Here he is followed by\r\nCastelain. But Q_{1} is a good edition and there is no sign whatever\r\nthat it had not Jonson’s authority, and as the entry in S. R. covers\r\nother Chamberlain’s plays, it is pretty clear that the company caused\r\nthe ‘staying’. St. Mark’s Day did not, as Fleay thought, fall on a\r\nFriday in 1601, and if it had, the dating is unchanged from Q_{1} and\r\nthe references to a queen may, as Simpson suggests, be due to Jonson’s\r\nconscientious desire to preserve consistency with the original date of\r\n1598. Nor is the play likely to have passed to the Chapel, since the\r\nKing’s men played it before James on 2 Feb. 1605 (cf. App. B). This\r\nrevival would be the natural time for a revision, and in fact seems to\r\nme on the whole the most likely date, in spite of two trifling bits\r\nof evidence which would fit in rather better a year later. These are\r\nreferences to the siege of Strigonium or Graan (1595) as ten years\r\nsince (III. i. 103), and to a present by the Turkey company to the\r\nGrand Signior (I. ii. 78), which was perhaps the gift worth £5,000\r\nsent about Christmas 1605 (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, xv. 3; xvii. 35; xx.\r\n27). No doubt also the revision of oaths in Jacobean plays is usually\r\ntaken as due to the _Act against Abuses of Players_ (1606), although\r\nit is conceivable that the personal taste of James may have required\r\na similar revision of plays selected for Court performance at an\r\nearlier date. Or this particular bit of revision, which was done for\r\nother plays before F_{1}, may be of later date than the rest. Simpson\r\nis in favour, largely on literary grounds, for a revision in 1612,\r\nin preparation for F_{1}. The Prologue, which is not in Q, probably\r\nbelongs to the revision, or at any rate to a revival later than 1598,\r\nsince it criticizes not only ‘Yorke, and Lancasters long jarres’, but\r\nalso plays in which ‘Chorus wafts you ore the seas’, as in _Henry V_\r\n(1599). These allusions would not come so well in 1612; on the other\r\nhand, Simpson’s date would enable us to suppose that the play in which\r\nthe public ‘grac’d monsters’ was the _Tempest_ (cf. the similar jibe\r\nin _Bartholomew Fair_). The character Matheo or Mathew represents a\r\nyoung gull of literary tendencies, and is made to spout passages from,\r\nor imitations of, Daniel’s verses. Perhaps this implies some indirect\r\ncriticism of Daniel, but it can hardly be regarded as a personal attack\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n                  _Every Man Out of his Humour. 1599_\r\n\r\n_S.

S._ xxxvi. 330).\r\n\r\nIn the main the text of F_{1} follows that of Q_{1} with some slight\r\nrevision of wording and oaths. The arrangement of the epilogues is\r\nsomewhat different, but seems intended to represent the same original\r\nstage history. In Q_{1} Macilente speaks an epilogue, ‘with Aspers\r\ntongue (though not his shape)’, evidently used in the theatre as it\r\nbegs ‘The happier spirits in this faire-fild Globe’ to confirm applause\r\n\r\n          as their pleasures Pattent: which so sign’d,\r\n    Our leane and spent Endeuours shall renue\r\n    Their Beauties with the _Spring_ to smile on you.\r\n\r\nThen comes a ‘Finis’ and on the next page, ‘It had another\r\n_Catastrophe_ or Conclusion at the first Playing: which (διὰ τὸ\r\nτὴν βασίλισσαν προσωποποιεῖσθαι) many seem’d not to relish it: and\r\ntherefore ’twas since alter’d: yet that a right-ei’d and solide\r\n_Reader_ may perceiue it was not so great a part of the Heauen awry,\r\nas they would make it; we request him but to looke downe vpon these\r\nfollowing Reasons.’ There follows an apology, from which it is clear\r\nthat originally Macilente was cured of his envious humour by the\r\nappearance on the stage of the Queen; and this introduces a different\r\nepilogue of the nature of an address to her. At the end of all comes\r\na short dialogue between Macilente, as Asper, and the _Grex_. There\r\nis no mention of the Globe, but as the whole point of the objection\r\nto this epilogue, which it is not suggested that Elizabeth herself\r\nshared, lay in the miming of the Queen, one would take it, did the\r\nQ_{1} stand alone, to have been, like its substitute, a theatre and\r\nnot a Court epilogue. In F_{1}, however, we get successively (_a_) a\r\nshortened version of the later epilogue, (_b_) the dialogue with the\r\n_Grex_, followed by ‘The End’, and (_c_) a version of the original\r\nepilogue, altered so as to make it less of a direct address and headed\r\n‘Which, in the presentation before Queen E. was thus varyed’. It seems\r\nto me a little difficult to believe that the play was given at Court\r\nbefore it had been ‘practised’ in public performances, and I conclude\r\nthat, having suppressed the address to a mimic Elizabeth at the Globe,\r\nJonson revived it in a slightly altered form when he took the play\r\nto Court at Christmas. As to the date of production, Fleay, i. 361,\r\nexcels himself in the suggestion that ‘the mention of “spring” and the\r\nallusion to the company’s new “patent” for the Globe in the epilogue’\r\nfix it to _c._ April 1599. Even if this were the original epilogue,\r\nit alludes to a coming and not a present spring, and might have been\r\nwritten at any time in the winter, either before or after the New Year.\r\nObviously, too, there can be no allusion to an Elizabethan patent for\r\nthe Globe, which never existed. I do not agree with Small, 21, that\r\nthe Globe was not opened until early in 1600, nor do I think that any\r\ninference can be drawn from the not very clear notes of dramatic time\r\nin I. iii and III. ii. At first sight it seems natural to suppose that\r\nthe phrase ‘would I had one of Kempes shooes to throw after you’ (IV.\r\nv) was written later than at any rate the planning of the famous morris\r\nto Norwich, which lasted from 11 Feb. to 11 March 1600 and at the end\r\nof which Kempe hung his shoes in Norwich Guildhall. Certainly it cannot\r\nrefer, as Fleay thinks, merely to Kempe’s leaving the Chamberlain’s\r\nmen. Conceivably it might be an interpolation of later date than the\r\noriginal production. Creizenach, 303, however, points out that in 1599\r\nThomas Platter saw a comedy in which a servant took off his shoe and\r\nthrew it at his master, and suggests that this was a bit of common-form\r\nstage clownery, in which case the Norwich dance would not be concerned.\r\nThe performance described by Platter was in September or October, and\r\napparently at the Curtain (cf. ch. xvi, introd.). Kempe may quite\r\nwell have been playing then at the Curtain with a fresh company after\r\nthe Chamberlain’s moved to the Globe. Perhaps the episode had already\r\nfound a place in Phillips’s _Jig of the Slippers_, printed in 1595\r\nand now lost (cf. ch. xviii). If 1600 is the date of _E. M. O._, the\r\nCourt performance may have been that of 3 February, or perhaps more\r\nprobably may have fallen in the following winter, which would explain\r\nthe divergence between Q_{1} and F_{1} as to the epilogues. But it\r\nmust be remembered that the F_{1} date is 1599, and that most, if not\r\nquite all, of the F_{1} dates follow Circumcision style, although\r\nJonson may not have adopted this style as early as 1600. On the whole,\r\nI think that the balance of probability is distinctly in favour of\r\n1599. If so, the production must have been fairly late in that year,\r\nas there is a hit (III. i) at the _Histriomastix_ of the same autumn.\r\nThe play has been hunted through and through for personalities, most\r\nof which are effectively refuted by Small. Most of the characters are\r\ntypes rather than individuals, and social types rather than literary\r\nor stage types. I do not think there are portraits of Daniel, Lyly,\r\nDrayton, Donne, Chapman, Munday, Shakespeare, Burbadge, in the play or\r\nits induction at all. Nor do I think there are portraits in the strict\r\nsense of Marston and Dekker, although no doubt some parody of Marston’s\r\n‘fustian’ vocabulary is put into the mouth of Clove (iii. 1), and, on\r\nthe other hand, the characters of Carlo Buffone and Fastidious Brisk\r\nhave analogies with the Anaides and Hedon of _Cynthia’s Revels_, and\r\nthese again with the Demetrius and Crispinus of _Poetaster_, who are\r\nundoubtedly Dekker and Marston. But we know from Aubrey, ii. 184, that\r\nCarlo was Charles Chester, a loose-tongued man about town, to whom\r\nthere are many contemporary references. To those collected by Small and\r\nHart (_10 N. Q._ i. 381) I may add Chamberlain, 7, Harington, _Ulysses\r\nupon Ajax_ (1596), 58, and _Hatfield Papers_, iv. 210, 221; x. 287.\r\nThe practical joke of sealing up Carlo’s mouth with wax (V. iii) was,\r\naccording to Aubrey, played upon Chester by Raleigh, and there may be\r\ntraits of Raleigh in Puntarvolo, perhaps combined with others of Sir\r\nJohn Harington, while Hart finds in the mouths both of Puntarvolo and\r\nof Fastidious Brisk the vocabulary of Gabriel Harvey. The play was\r\nrevived at Court on 8 Jan. 1605.\r\n\r\n                      _Cynthia’s Revels. 1600–1_\r\n\r\n_S.

Bang and L. Krebs (1908, _Materialien_, xxii).\r\n\r\nThe difference between the Q and F_{1} texts amounts to more than mere\r\nrevision of wording and of oaths. _Criticus_ is renamed _Crites_, and\r\nthe latter half of the play is given in a longer form, parts of IV. i\r\nand IV. iii, and the whole of V. i-iv appearing in F_{1} alone. I think\r\nthe explanation is to be found in a shortening of the original text\r\nfor representation, rather than in subsequent additions. Jonson’s date\r\nfor the play is 1600. This Small, 23, would translate as Feb. or March\r\n1601, neglecting the difficulty due to the possibility that Jonson’s\r\ndate represents Circumcision style. He relies on V. xi, where Cynthia\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    For so Actaeon, by presuming farre,\r\n    Did (to our griefe) incurre a fatall doome;\r\n    ... But are we therefore judged too extreme?\r\n    Seemes it no crime, to enter sacred bowers,\r\n    And hallowed places, with impure aspect,\r\n    Most lewdly to pollute?\r\n\r\nRightly rejecting the suggestion of Fleay, i. 363, that this alludes to\r\nNashe and the _Isle of Dogs_, Small refers it to the disgrace of Essex,\r\nand therefore dates the play after his execution on 25 Feb. 1601.\r\nBut surely the presumption which Jonson has in mind is not Essex’s\r\nrebellion, but his invasion of Elizabeth’s apartment on his return from\r\nIreland in 1599, and the ‘fatall doome’ is merely his loss of offices\r\nin June 1600. I do not believe that a Court dramatist would have dared\r\nto refer to Essex at all after 25 Feb. 1601. I feel little doubt that\r\nthe play was the subject of the Chapel presentation on 6 Jan. 1601, and\r\nthe description of this by the Treasurer of the Chamber as including\r\na ‘show’, which puzzled Small, is explained by the presence of a\r\nfull-blown Court mask in V. vii-x. The original production will have\r\nbeen in the winter of 1600, soon after Evans set up the Chapel plays.\r\nAs to personalities, Small rightly rejects the identifications of Hedon\r\nwith Daniel, Anaides with Marston, and Asotus with Lodge. Amorphus\r\nrepeats the type of Puntarvolo from _E. M. O._ and like Puntarvolo\r\nmay show traces of the Harveian vocabulary. As _Satiromastix_, I. ii.\r\n191, applies to Crispinus and Demetrius the descriptions (III. iii)\r\nof Hedon as ‘a light voluptuous reveller’ and Anaides as ‘a strange\r\narrogating puff’, it seems clear that Marston and Dekker, rightly or\r\nwrongly, fitted on these caps. Similarly, there is a clear attempt in\r\n_Satiromastix_, I. ii. 376, ‘You must be call’d Asper, and Criticus,\r\nand Horace’, to charge Jonson with lauding himself as Criticus. But\r\nthe description of the ‘creature of a most perfect and diuine temper’\r\nin II. iii surely goes beyond even Jonson’s capacity of self-praise. I\r\nwonder whether he can have meant Donne, whom he seems from a remark to\r\nDrummond (Laing, 6) to have introduced as Criticus in an introductory\r\ndialogue to the _Ars Poetica_.\r\n\r\nOf the three children who appear in the induction, both Q and F_{1}\r\nname one as Jack. He might be either Underwood or Frost. Q alone\r\n(l. 214) names another, who played Anaides, as Sall, i.e. Salathiel\r\nPavy. An interesting light is thrown on the beginnings of the Chapel\r\nenterprise by the criticism (_Ind._ 188), ‘They say, the _Vmbrae_, or\r\nGhosts of some three or foure Playes, departed a dozen yeares since,\r\nhaue been seene walking on your Stage here.’\r\n\r\n                         _The Poetaster. 1601_\r\n\r\n_S.

After the\r\ndialogue: ‘This comicall Satyre was first acted, in the yeere 1601.\r\nBy the then Children of Queene Elizabeths Chappell. The principall\r\nComœdians were, Nat. Field, Ioh.

H.\r\nPenniman (1913, _B. L._).\r\n\r\nThe play is admittedly an attack upon the poetaster represented as\r\nCrispinus, and his identity is clear from Jonson’s own statement\r\nto Drummond (Laing, 20) that ‘he had many quarrells with Marston,\r\nbeat him, and took his pistol from him, wrote his Poetaster on him’.\r\nMarston’s vocabulary is elaborately ridiculed in V. iii. Nor is there\r\nany reason to doubt that Demetrius Fannius, ‘a dresser of plaies about\r\nthe towne, here’, who has been ‘hir’d to abuse Horace, and bring him\r\nin, in a play’ (III. iv. 367), is Dekker, who certainly associated\r\nhimself with Marston as a victim of Jonson’s arraignment, and wrote\r\n_Satiromastix_ (q.v.) in reply. At the same time these characters\r\ncontinue the types of Hedon and Anaides from _Cynthia’s Revels_,\r\nalthough these were not literary men. Horace is Jonson himself, as the\r\nrival portrait of Horace in _Satiromastix_ shows, while Dekker tells\r\nus that Tucca is ‘honest Capten Hannam’, doubtless the Jack Hannam\r\ntraceable as a Captain under Drake in 1585; cf. the reference to him\r\nin a letter of that year printed by F. P. Wilson in _M. L. R._ xv. 81.\r\nFleay, i. 367, has a long list of identifications of minor personages,\r\nOvid with Donne, Tibullus with Daniel, and so forth, all of which may\r\nsafely be laid aside, and in particular I do not think that the fine\r\neulogies of Virgil (V. i) are meant for Chapman, or for Shakespeare,\r\napplicable as some of them are to him, or for any one but Virgil. On\r\nthe matter of identifications there is little to add to the admirable\r\ntreatment of Small, 25. But in addition to the personal attacks,\r\nthe play clearly contains a more generalized criticism of actors,\r\nthe challenge of which seems to have been specially taken up by the\r\nChamberlain’s men (cf. ch. xi), while there is evidence that Tucca\r\nand, I suppose, Lupus were taken amiss by the soldiers and the lawyers\r\nrespectively. The latter at least were powerful, and in the epistle\r\nto Martin Jonson speaks of the play as one ‘for whose innocence,\r\nas for the Authors, you were once a noble and timely undertaker, to\r\nthe greatest Iustice of this Kingdome’, and on behalf of posterity\r\nacknowledges a debt for ‘the reading of that ... which so much\r\nignorance, and malice of the times, then conspir’d to haue supprest’.\r\nEvidently Jonson had not made matters better by his Apologetical\r\nDialogue, the printing of which with the play was restrained. In this\r\nhe denies that he\r\n\r\n                                        tax’d\r\n    The Law, and Lawyers; Captaines; and the Players\r\n    By their particular names;\r\n\r\nbut admits his intention to try and shame the\r\n\r\n    Fellowes of practis’d and most laxative tongues,\r\n\r\nof whom he says, that during\r\n\r\n                                    three yeeres,\r\n    They did provoke me with their petulant stiles\r\n    On every stage.\r\n\r\nNow he has done with it, will not answer the ‘libells’, or the\r\n‘untrussers’ (i. e. _Satiromastix_), and is turning to tragedy.\r\n\r\nJonson gives the date of production as 1601. The play followed\r\n_Cynthia’s Revels_, criticisms on the epilogue of which inspired its\r\n‘armed Prologue’, who sets a foot on Envy. Envy has been waiting\r\nfifteen weeks since the plot was an ‘embrion’, and this is chaffed in\r\n_Satiromastix_, I. ii. 447, ‘What, will he bee fifteene weekes about\r\nthis cockatrice’s egge too?’ Later (V. ii. 218) Horace is told, ‘You\r\nand your itchy poetry breake out like Christmas, but once a yeare’.\r\nThis stung Jonson, who replied in the Apologetical Dialogue,\r\n\r\n      _Polyposus._                 They say you are slow,\r\n    And scarse bring forth a play a yeere.\r\n      _Author._                         ’Tis true.\r\n    I would they could not say that I did that.\r\n\r\nThe year’s interval must not be pressed too closely. On the other\r\nhand, I do not know why Small, 25, assumes that the fifteen weeks\r\nspent on the _Poetaster_ began directly after _Cynthia’s Revels_ was\r\nproduced, whatever that date may be. It must have come very near that\r\nof _Satiromastix_, for Horace knows that Demetrius has been hired to\r\nwrite a play on him. On the other hand, _Satiromastix_ cannot possibly\r\nhave been actually written until the contents of _Poetaster_ were known\r\nto Dekker. The S. R. entry of _Satiromastix_ is 11 Nov. 1601, and the\r\ntwo dates of production may reasonably be placed in the late spring or\r\nearly autumn of the same year. The Note to the Reader in Q shows that\r\nthe Dialogue had been restrained before _Poetaster_ itself appeared in\r\n1602. Probably it was spoken in December between the two S. R. entries.\r\nHart (_9 N. Q._ xi. 202) assuming that the contemplated tragedy was\r\n_Sejanus_ (q.v.) put it in 1603, but this is too late.\r\n\r\n                            _Sejanus. 1603_\r\n\r\n_S.

Q._ v. 502).\r\n\r\nAs the theatres were probably closed from Elizabeth’s death to March\r\n1604, the production may have been at Court in the autumn or winter\r\nof 1603, although, if _Sejanus_ is the something ‘high, and aloofe’\r\ncontemplated at the end of the Apologetical Dialogue to _Poetaster_\r\n(q.v.), it must have been in Jonson’s mind since 1601. The epistle to\r\nAubigny admits the ‘violence’ which the play received in public, and\r\n‘Ev. B.’s’ verses indicate that this ‘beastly rage’ was at the Globe.\r\nMarston’s verses were presumably written before his renewed quarrel\r\nwith Jonson over _Eastward Ho!_ (q.v.), and there appears to be an\r\nunkindly reference to _Sejanus_ in the epistle to his _Sophonisba_\r\n(1606). But either _Eastward Ho!_ or something else caused publication\r\nto be delayed for nearly a year after the S. R. entry, since Chapman’s\r\nverses contain a compliment to the Earl of Suffolk,\r\n\r\n    Who when our Hearde came not to drink, but trouble\r\n      The Muses waters, did a Wall importune,\r\n    (Midst of assaults) about their sacred River,\r\n\r\nwhich seems to refer to his share in freeing Jonson and Chapman from\r\nprison about Sept. or Oct. 1605. Chapman also has compliments to the\r\nEarls of Northampton and Northumberland. It must therefore be to a\r\nlater date that Jonson referred, when he told Drummond (Laing, 22) that\r\n‘Northampton was his mortall enimie for beating, on a St. George’s\r\nday, one of his attenders; He was called before the Councell for his\r\nSejanus, and accused both of poperie and treason by him’. Fleay, i.\r\n372, suggests that the reference at the end of the Q version of the\r\nArgument to treason against princes, ‘for guard of whose piety and\r\nvertue, the _Angels_ are in continuall watch, and _God_ himselfe\r\nmiraculously working’, implies publication after the discovery of the\r\nPlot. On the other hand, one would have expected Chapman’s reference\r\nto Northumberland, if not already printed, to be suppressed, in view\r\nof the almost immediate suspicion of a connexion with the Plot that\r\nfell upon him. Castelain, 907, considers, and rightly rejects, another\r\nsuggestion by Fleay that _Sejanus_ and not _Eastward Ho!_ was the cause\r\nof the imprisonment of Jonson and Chapman in 1605. Fleay supposed that\r\nChapman was the collaborator of whom Jonson wrote in the Q epistle, ‘I\r\nwould informe you, that this Booke, in all numbers, is not the same\r\nwith that which was acted on the publike Stage, wherein a second pen\r\nhad good share; in place of which I have rather chosen, to put weaker\r\n(and no doubt lesse pleasing) of mine own, then to defraud so happy\r\na _Genius_ of his right, by my lothed usurpation’. Shakespeare also\r\nhas been guessed at. If Jonson’s language was seriously meant, there\r\nwere not, of course, many contemporaries of whom he would have so\r\nspoken. Probably the problem is insoluble, as the subject-matter of\r\nit has disappeared. It is difficult to believe that the collaborator\r\nwas Samuel Sheppard, who in his _The Times Displayed in Six Sestyads_\r\n(1646) claims to have ‘dictated to’ Ben Jonson ‘when as Sejanus’ fall\r\nhe writ’.

N._ xx. 63).\r\n\r\nJonson dates the production 1605, and the uncertainty as to the style\r\nhe used leaves it possible that this may cover the earlier part of\r\n1606. Fleay, i. 373, attempts to get nearer with the help of the news\r\nfrom London brought to Venice by Peregrine in II. i. Some of this does\r\nnot help us much. The baboons had probably been in London as early as\r\n1603 at least (cf. s.v. _Sir Giles Goosecap_). The Tower lioness had a\r\nwhelp on 5 Aug. 1604, another on 26 Feb. 1605, and two more on 27 July\r\n1605 (Stowe, ed. 1615, 844, 857, 870). The ‘another whelp’ of _Volpone_\r\nwould suggest Feb.–July 1605. On the other hand, the whale at Woolwich\r\nis recorded by Stowe, 880, a few days after the porpoise at West Ham\r\n(not ‘above the bridge’ as in _Volpone_) on 19 Jan. 1606. Holt argues\r\nfrom this that, as Peregrine left England seven weeks before, the play\r\nmust have been produced in March 1606, but this identification of\r\nactual and dramatic time can hardly be taken for granted. There are\r\nalso allusions to meteors at Berwick and a new star, both in 1604, and\r\nto the building of a raven in a royal ship and the death of Stone the\r\nfool, which have not been dated and might help. Gawdy, 146, writes on\r\n18 June 1604 that ‘Stone was knighted last weeke, I meane not Stone the\r\nfoole, but Stone of Cheapsyde’. Stone the fool was whipped about March,\r\n1605 (Winwood, ii. 52). The suggested allusion to _Volpone_ in Day’s\r\n_Isle of Gulls_ (q.v.) of Feb. 1606 is rather dubious. The ambiguity of\r\nstyle must also leave us uncertain whether Q and its dedication belong\r\nto 1607 or 1608, and therefore whether ‘their love and acceptance\r\nshewn to his poeme in the presentation’ by the Universities was in\r\n1606 or 1607. This epistle contains a justification of Jonson’s comic\r\nmethod. He has had to undergo the ‘imputation of sharpnesse’, but has\r\nnever provoked a ‘nation, societie, or generall order, or state’, or\r\nany ‘publique person’. Nor has he been ‘particular’ or ‘personall’,\r\nexcept to ‘a mimick, cheater, bawd, or buffon, creatures (for their\r\ninsolencies) worthy to be tax’d’. But that he has not wholly forgotten\r\nthe _Poetomachia_ is clear from a reference to the ‘petulant stiles’ of\r\nother poets, while in the prologue he recalls the old criticism that he\r\nwas a year about each play, and asserts that he wrote _Volpone_ in five\r\nweeks. The commendatory verses suggest that the play was successful.\r\nFleay’s theory that it is referred to in the epilogue to the anonymous\r\n_Mucedorus_ (q.v.), as having given offence, will not bear analysis.\r\nThe passage in III. iv about English borrowings from Guarini and\r\nMontaigne is too general in its application to be construed as a\r\nspecific attack on Daniel. But the gossip of Aubrey, ii. 246, on Thomas\r\nSutton, the founder of the Charterhouse, relates that ‘’Twas from him\r\nthat B. Johnson took his hint of the fox, and by Seigneur Volpone is\r\nmeant Sutton’.\r\n\r\n                           _Epicoene. 1609_\r\n\r\n_S.

Henry (1906, _Yale\r\nStudies_, xxxi) and C. M. Gayley (1913, _R. E. C._ ii).\r\n\r\nThe first prologue speaks of the play as fit for ‘your men, and\r\ndaughters of _white-Friars’_, and at Whitefriars the play was probably\r\nproduced by the Revels children, either at the end of 1609, or, if\r\nJonson’s chronology permits, early in 1610. Jonson told Drummond\r\n(Laing, 41) that, ‘When his play of a Silent Woman was first acted,\r\nther was found verses after on the stage against him, concluding that\r\nthat play was well named the Silent Woman, ther was never one man to\r\nsay _Plaudite_ to it’. Fleay, i. 374, suggests an equation between Sir\r\nJohn Daw and Sir John Harington. In I. i. 86 Clerimont says of Lady\r\nHaughty, the President of the Collegiates, ‘A poxe of her autumnall\r\nface, her peec’d beautie’. I hope that this was not, as suggested by\r\nH. J. C. Grierson, _Poems of Donne_, ii. 63, a hit at Lady Danvers, on\r\nwhom Donne wrote (Elegy ix):\r\n\r\n    No _Spring_, nor _Summer_ Beauty hath such grace,\r\n    As I have seen in one _Autumnall_ face.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I do not suppose that these are the passages which led to\r\nthe ‘exception’ necessitating the second prologue. This ends with the\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    If any, yet, will (with particular slight\r\n      Of application) wrest what he doth write;\r\n    And that he meant or him, or her, will say:\r\n      They make a libell, which he made a play.\r\n\r\nJonson evidently refers to the same matter in the Epistle, where\r\nhe says: ‘There is not a line, or syllable in it changed from the\r\nsimplicity of the first copy. And, when you shall consider, through the\r\ncertaine hatred of some, how much a mans innocency may bee indanger’d\r\nby an vn-certaine accusation; you will, I doubt not, so beginne to\r\nhate the iniquitie of such natures, as I shall loue the contumely done\r\nme, whose end was so honorable, as to be wip’d off by your sentence.’\r\nI think the explanation is to be found in a dispatch of the Venetian\r\nambassador on 8 Feb. 1610 (_V. P._ xi. 427), who reports that Lady\r\nArabella Stuart ‘complains that in a certain comedy the playwright\r\nintroduced an allusion to her person and the part played by the Prince\r\nof Moldavia. The play was suppressed.’ The reference may be to V. i. 17\r\nof the play:\r\n\r\n   _La Foole._ He [_Daw_] has his boxe of instruments ...\r\n   to draw maps of euery place, and person, where he comes.\r\n\r\n   _Clerimont._ How, maps of persons!\r\n\r\n   _La Foole._ Yes, sir, of Nomentack, when he was here, and\r\n   of the Prince of _Moldauia_, and of his mistris, mistris\r\n   _Epicoene_.\r\n\r\n   _Clerimont._ Away! he has not found out her latitude, I\r\n   hope.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Moldavia visited London in 1607 and is said to have been\r\na suitor for Arabella, but if Jonson’s text is really not ‘changed\r\nfrom the simplicity of the first copy’, it is clear that Arabella\r\nmisunderstood it, since Epicoene was Daw’s mistress.\r\n\r\n                         _The Alchemist. 1610_\r\n\r\n_S.

C._).\r\n\r\nJonson’s date is confirmed by the references in II. vi. 31 and IV. iv.\r\n29 to the age of Dame Pliant, who is 19 and was born in 1591. In view\r\nof the S. R. entry, one would take the production to have fallen in\r\nthe earlier half of the year, before the plague reached forty deaths,\r\nwhich it did from 12 July to 29 Nov. The action is set in plague-time,\r\nbut obviously the experience of 1609 and early years might suggest\r\nthis. Fleay, i. 375, and others following him argue that the action\r\nof the play is confined to one day, that this is fixed by V. v. 102\r\nto ‘the second day of the fourth week in the eighth month’, and that\r\nthis must be 24 October. They are not deterred by the discrepancy\r\nof this with III. ii. 129, which gives only a fifteen-days interval\r\nbefore ‘the second day, of the third weeke, in the ninth month’, i. e.\r\non their principles 17 November. And they get over the S.R. entry by\r\nassuming that Jonson planned to stage the play on 24 October and then,\r\nfinding early in October that the plague continued, decided to publish\r\nit at once. This seems to me extraordinarily thin, in the absence of\r\nclearer knowledge as to the system of chronology employed by Ananias\r\nof Amsterdam. Aubrey, i. 213, says that John Dee ‘used to distill\r\negge-shells, and ’twas from hence that Ben Johnson had his hint of the\r\nalkimist, whom he meant’. The play was given by the King’s men at Court\r\nduring 1612–13.\r\n\r\n                    _Catiline his Conspiracy. 1611_\r\n\r\n1611. Catiline his Conspiracy.

The play was given at Court on 1 Nov. 1614 (App. B), and a\r\nmock indenture between the author and the spectators at the Hope, on\r\n31 Oct. 1614, is recited in the Induction and presumably fixes the\r\ndate of production. One must not therefore assume that a ballad of\r\n_Rome for Company in Bartholomew Faire_, registered on 22 Oct. 1614\r\n(Arber, iii. 554), was aimed at Jonson. Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, 78,\r\nfollows Malone and Fleay, i. 80, in inferring from a mention of a\r\nforthcoming ‘Johnsons play’ in a letter of 13 Nov. 1613 from Daborne\r\nto Henslowe that the production may have been intended for 1613, but\r\nI think that Daborne refers to the revival of _Eastward Ho!_ The\r\nInduction describes the locality of the Hope as ‘being as durty as\r\n_Smithfield_, and as stinking euery whit’, and possibly glances at\r\nthe _Winter’s Tale_ and _Tempest_ in disclaiming the introduction of\r\n‘a _Seruant-monster_’ and ‘a nest of _Antiques_’, since the author\r\nis ‘loth to make Nature afraid in his _Playes_, like those that\r\nbeget _Tales_, _Tempests_, and such like _Drolleries_’. There is\r\nno actor-list, but in V. iii ‘Your best _Actor_. Your _Field_?’ is\r\nreferred to on a level with ‘your _Burbage_’. Similarly the puppet\r\nLeander is said to shake his head ‘like an hostler’ and it is declared\r\nthat ‘one _Taylor_, would goe neere to beat all this company, with\r\na hand bound behinde him’. Field and Taylor were both of the Lady\r\nElizabeth’s men in 1614, while the allusion to Ostler of the King’s men\r\nis apparently satirical. The suggestion of Ordish, 225, that Taylor\r\nis the water poet, who had recently appeared on the Hope stage, is\r\nless probable. The ‘word out of the play, _Palemon_’ (IV. iii) is set\r\nagainst another, _Argalus_ ‘out of the _Arcadia_’, and might therefore,\r\nas Fleay, i. 377, thinks, refer to Daniel’s _Queen’s Arcadia_ (1605),\r\nbut the Palamon of _T. N. K._ was probably quite recent. I see no\r\nreason to accept Fleay’s identification of Littlewit with Daniel; that\r\nof Lanthorn Leatherhead with Inigo Jones is more plausible. Gifford\r\nsuggested that the burlesque puppet-play of Damon and Pythias in\r\nV. iv may have been retrieved by Jonson from earlier work, perhaps\r\nfor the real puppet-stage, since ‘Old Cole’ is a character, and in\r\n_Satiromastix_ Horace is called ‘puppet-teacher’ (1980) and in another\r\npassage (607) ‘olde Coale’, and told that Crispinus and Demetrius ‘shal\r\nbe thy Damons and thou their Pithyasse’.\r\n\r\n                      _The Devil Is An Ass 1616_\r\n\r\n1631.

A. und\r\nJohn Wilson’s Belphegor zu Machiavelli’s Novelle vom Belfagor_ (1901).\r\n\r\nIn the play itself are introduced references to a performance of _The\r\nDevil_ as a new play, to its playbill, to the Blackfriars as the house,\r\nand to Dick Robinson as a player of female parts (I. iv. 43; vi. 31;\r\nII. viii. 64; III. v. 38). Probably the production was towards the end\r\nrather than the beginning of 1616.\r\n\r\n                             _Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nI do not feel able to accept the view, expounded by Fleay, i. 370, 386,\r\nand adopted by some later writers, that _A Tale of a Tub_, licensed\r\nby Herbert on 7 May 1633, was only a revision of one of Jonson’s\r\nElizabethan plays. It appears to rest almost wholly upon references\r\nto a ‘queen’. These are purely dramatic, and part of an attempt to\r\ngive the action an old-fashioned setting. The queen intended is not\r\nElizabeth, but Mary. There are also references to ‘last King Harry’s\r\ntime’ (I. ii), ‘King Edward, our late liege and sovereign lord’ (I. v).\r\nA character says, ‘He was King Harry’s doctor and my god-phere’ (IV.\r\ni). The priest is ‘Canon’ or ‘Sir’ Hugh, and has a ‘Latin tongue’ (III.\r\nvii). ‘Old John Heywood’ is alive (V. ii).\r\n\r\nIn 1619 Jonson told Drummond (Laing, 27) ‘That the half of his Comedies\r\nwere not in print’. The unprinted ones of course included _Bartholomew\r\nFair_ and _The Devil is an Ass_. He went on to describe ‘a pastorall\r\nintitled The May Lord’, in which he figured himself as Alkin. As it\r\nhad a ‘first storie’, it may not have been dramatic. But Alkin appears\r\nin _The Sad Shepherd_, a fragment of a dramatic pastoral, printed in\r\nF_{2} with a prologue in which Jonson describes himself as ‘He that\r\nhath feasted you these forty yeares’, and which therefore cannot have\r\nbeen written long before his death in 1637. This is edited by W. W.\r\nGreg (1905, _Materialien_, xi) with an elaborate discussion in which\r\nhe arrives at the sound conclusions that the theory of its substantial\r\nidentity with _The May Lord_ must be rejected, and that there is no\r\ndefinite evidence to oppose to the apparent indication of its date in\r\nthe prologue.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether any of Jonson’s early work for Pembroke’s and\r\nthe Admiral’s, except perhaps _The Case is Altered_, ever found its way\r\ninto print. The record of all the following plays, except the first, is\r\nin Henslowe’s diary (cf. Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 288).\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Isle of Dogs._\r\n\r\nSee s.v. Nashe.\r\n\r\n(_b_) On 3 Dec. 1597 he received £1 ‘vpon a boocke w^{ch} he showed the\r\nplotte vnto the company w^{ch} he promysed to dd vnto the company at\r\ncrysmas’. It is just possible that this was _Dido and Aeneas_, produced\r\nby the Admiral’s on 8 Jan. 1598. But no further payment to Jonson is\r\nrecorded, and it is more likely that _Dido and Aeneas_ was taken over\r\nfrom Pembroke’s repertory; and it may be that Jonson had not carried\r\nout his contract before the fray with Spencer in Sept. 1598, and that\r\nthis is the ‘Bengemens plotte’ on which Chapman was writing a tragedy\r\non the following 23 Oct. The theory that it is the _Fall of Mortimer_,\r\nstill little more than a plot when Jonson died, may safely be rejected\r\n(Henslowe, ii. 188, 199, 224).\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Hot Anger Soon Cold._\r\n\r\nWritten with Chettle and Porter in Aug. 1598 (Henslowe, ii. 196).\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Page of Plymouth._\r\n\r\nWritten with Dekker in Aug. and Sept. 1599 (Henslowe, ii. 205).\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Robert the Second, King of Scots._\r\n\r\nA tragedy, written with Chettle, Dekker, ‘& other Jentellman’ (probably\r\nMarston) in Sept. 1599 (Henslowe, ii. 205).\r\n\r\n(_f_) Additions to _Jeronimo_.\r\n\r\nSee s.v.

Soc._ from\r\nMS.).\r\n\r\nThe maskers, in azure and silver, were twelve nymphs, ‘negroes and\r\nthe daughters of Niger’; the torchbearers, in sea-green, Oceaniae;\r\nthe presenters Oceanus, Niger, and Aethiopia the Moon; the musicians\r\nTritons, Sea-maids, and Echoes.\r\n\r\nThe locality was the old Elizabethan banqueting-house at Whitehall\r\n(Carleton; Office of Works). The curtain represented a ‘landtschap’ of\r\nwoods with hunting scenes, ‘which falling’, according to the Quarto,\r\n‘an artificial sea was seen to shoot forth’. The MS. describes the\r\nlandscape as ‘drawne uppon a downe right cloth, strayned for the scene,\r\n... which openinge in manner of a curtine’, the sea shoots forth. On\r\nthe sea were the maskers in a concave shell, and the torchbearers borne\r\nby sea-monsters.\r\n\r\nThe maskers, on landing, presented their fans. They gave ‘their own\r\nsingle dance’, and then made ‘choice of their men’ for ‘several\r\nmeasures and corantoes’. A final dance took them back to their shell.\r\n\r\nThis was a Queen’s mask, danced by the Queen, the Countesses of\r\nBedford, Derby, and Suffolk, the Ladies Rich, Bevill, Howard of\r\nEffingham, Wroth, and Walsingham, Lady Elizabeth Howard, Anne Lady\r\nHerbert, and Susan Lady Herbert. The ‘bodily part’ was the ‘design and\r\nact’ of Inigo Jones.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Edmondes told Lord Shrewsbury on 5 Dec. that the mask was to\r\ncost the Exchequer £3,000 (Lodge, iii. 114). The same sum was stated by\r\nChamberlain to Winwood on 18 Dec. to have been ‘delivered a month ago’\r\n(Winwood, ii. 41). Molin (_V. P._ x. 201) reported the amount on 19\r\nDec. as 25,000 crowns. On 12 Dec. John Packer wrote to Winwood of the\r\npreparations, and after naming some of the maskers added, ‘The Lady of\r\nNorthumberland is excused by sickness, Lady Hartford by the measles.\r\nLady of Nottingham hath the polypus in her nostril, which some fear\r\nmust be cut off. The Lady Hatton would feign have had a part, but some\r\nunknown reason kept her out’ (Winwood, ii. 39). The performance was\r\ndescribed by Carleton to Winwood, as following the creation of Prince\r\nCharles as Duke of York on 6 Jan. (Winwood, ii. 44): ‘At night we had\r\nthe Queen’s maske in the Banquetting-House, or rather her pagent. There\r\nwas a great engine at the lower end of the room, which had motion,\r\nand in it were the images of sea-horses with other terrible fishes,\r\nwhich were ridden by Moors: The indecorum was, that there was all\r\nfish and no water. At the further end was a great shell in form of a\r\nskallop, wherein were four seats; on the lowest sat the Queen with my\r\nLady Bedford; on the rest were placed the Ladies Suffolk, Darby, Rich,\r\nEffingham, Ann Herbert, Susan Herbert, Elizabeth Howard, Walsingham,\r\nand Bevil. Their apparell was rich, but too light and curtizan-like for\r\nsuch great ones. Instead of vizzards, their faces, and arms up to the\r\nelbows, were painted black, which was disguise sufficient, for they\r\nwere hard to be known; but it became them nothing so well as their\r\nred and white, and you cannot imagine a more ugly sight, then a troop\r\nof lean-cheek’d Moors. The Spanish and Venetian ambassadors were both\r\npresent, and sate by the King in state, at which Monsieur Beaumont\r\nquarrells so extreamly, that he saith the whole court is Spanish. But\r\nby his favour, he should fall out with none but himself, for they were\r\nall indifferently invited to come as private men, to a private sport;\r\nwhich he refusing, the Spanish ambassador willingly accepted, and\r\nbeing there, seeing no cause to the contrary, he put off Don Taxis,\r\nand took upon him El Señor Embaxadour, wherein he outstript our little\r\nMonsieur. He was ... taken out to dance, and footed it like a lusty old\r\ngallant with his country woman. He took out the Queen, and forgot not\r\nto kiss her hand, though there was danger it would have left a mark on\r\nhis lips. The night’s work was concluded with a banquet in the great\r\nChamber, which was so furiously assaulted, that down went table and\r\ntressels before one bit was touched.’ Carleton gives some additional\r\ninformation in another account, which he sent to Chamberlain on 7 Jan.\r\n(_S. P. D. Jac. I_, xii. 6, quoted by Sullivan, 28), as that the ‘black\r\nfaces and hands, which were painted and bare up to the elbowes, was a\r\nvery lothsome sight’, and he was ‘sory that strangers should see owr\r\ncourt so strangely disguised’; that ‘the confusion in getting in was\r\nso great, that some Ladies lie by it and complain of the fury of the\r\nwhite stafes’; that ‘in the passages through the galleries they were\r\nshutt up in several heapes betwixt dores and there stayed till all was\r\nended’; and that there were losses ‘of chaynes, jewels, purces and such\r\nlike loose ware’. References in letters to one Benson and by the Earl\r\nof Errol to Cecil (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, xii. 16; xix. 25) add nothing\r\nmaterial. Carleton’s account of the triumph of the Spanish ambassador\r\nis confirmed by reports of the Venetian (_V. P._ x. 212) and French\r\n(_B. M. King’s MS._ cxxvii, ff. 117, 127^v, 177^v; cf. Sullivan, 196–8)\r\nambassadors. Beaumont had pleaded illness in order to avoid attending a\r\nmask on 27 Dec. 1604 in private, and the Court chose to assume that he\r\nwas still ill on 6 Jan. This gave De Taxis and Molin an opening to get\r\ntheir private invitations converted into public ones. Beaumont lost his\r\ntemper and accused Sir Lewis Lewknor and other officials of intriguing\r\nagainst him, but he had to accept his defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Accounts of the Master of the Revels (Cunningham, 204) record\r\n‘The Queens Ma^{tis} Maske of Moures with Aleven Laydies of honnour’\r\nas given on 6 Jan. Reyher, 358, 520, notes references to the mask in\r\naccounts of the Treasurer of the Chamber and of the Office of Works,\r\nand quotes from the latter items for ‘framinge and settinge vpp of a\r\ngreat stage in the banquettinge house xl foote square and iiij^{or}\r\nfoote in heighte with wheeles to goe on ... framinge and settinge vpp\r\nan other stage’.\r\n\r\nMany of the notices of the Queen’s mask also refer to another mask\r\nwhich was performed ‘among the noblemen and gentlemen’ (Lodge, iii.\r\n114) on 27 Dec. 1604, at the wedding of Sir Philip Herbert and Lady\r\nSusan Vere, daughter of the Earl of Oxford. The bride was herself a\r\ndancer in the Queen’s mask. The wedding mask, the subject of which\r\nwas Juno and Hymenaeus, is unfortunately lost. The Revels Accounts\r\n(Cunningham, 204) tell us that it was ‘presented by the Earl of\r\nPembroke, the Lord Willowbie and 6 Knightes more of the Court’, and\r\nStowe’s _Chronicle_, 856, briefly records ‘braue Masks of the most\r\nnoble ladies’. Carleton gave Winwood details of the wedding, and said\r\n(Winwood, ii. 43): ‘At night there was a mask in the Hall, which for\r\nconceit and fashion was suitable to the occasion. The actors were the\r\nEarle of Pembrook, the Lord Willoby, Sir Samuel [James?] Hays, Sir\r\nThomas Germain, Sir Robert Cary, Sir John Lee, Sir Richard Preston,\r\nand Sir Thomas Bager. There was no smal loss that night of chaines and\r\njewells, and many great ladies were made shorter by the skirts, and\r\nwere well enough served that they could keep cut no better.’ Carleton\r\nwrote to Chamberlain (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, xii. 6, quoted by Sullivan,\r\n25): ‘Theyre conceit was a representacion of Junoes temple at the lower\r\nend of the great hall, which was vawted and within it the maskers\r\nseated with staves of lights about them, and it was no ill shew.\r\nThey were brought in by the fower seasons of the yeare and Hymeneus:\r\nwhich for songs and speaches was as goode as a play. Theyre apparel\r\nwas rather costly then cumly; but theyr dancing full of life and\r\nvariety; onely S^r Tho: Germain had lead in his heales and sometimes\r\nforgott what he was doing.’ There was a diplomatic contretemps on this\r\noccasion. At the wedding dinner the Venetian ambassador Molin was\r\ngiven precedence of the Queen’s brother, the Duke of Holstein, to the\r\nannoyance of the latter. But after dinner Molin was led to a closet and\r\nforgotten there until supper was already begun. Meanwhile the Duke took\r\nhis place. There was a personal apology from the King, and at the mask\r\nMolin was given a stool in the royal box to the right of the King, and\r\nthe Duke one to the left of the Queen. He preferred to stand for three\r\nhours rather than make use of it (Winwood, ii. 43; Sullivan, 25; _V.\r\nP._ x. 206).\r\n\r\nCarleton wrote to Winwood (ii. 44), ‘They say the Duke of Holst will\r\ncome upon us with an after reckoning, and that we shall see him on\r\nCandlemas night in a mask, as he hath shewed himself a lusty reveller\r\nall this Christmas’. But if this mask ever took place, nothing is known\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n                        _Hymenaei. 5 Jan. 1606_\r\n\r\n1606. Hymenaei: or The Solemnities of Masque, and Barriers,\r\nMagnificently performed on the eleventh, and twelfth Nights,\r\nfrom Christmas; At Court: To the auspicious celebrating of the\r\nMarriage-vnion, betweene Robert, Earle of Essex, and the Lady Frances,\r\nsecond Daughter to the most noble Earle of Suffolke. By Ben: Ionson.\r\n_Valentine Sims for Thomas Thorp._\r\n\r\n1616. Hymenaei, or The solemnities of Masque and Barriers at a\r\nMarriage. [Part of F_{1}.]\r\n\r\nThis was a double mask of eight men and eight women. The men, in\r\ncarnation cloth of silver, with variously coloured mantles and watchet\r\ncloth of silver bases, were Humours and Affections; the women, in white\r\ncloth of silver, with carnation and blue undergarments, the Powers of\r\nJuno; the presenters Hymen, with a bride, bridegroom, and bridal train,\r\nReason, and Order; the musicians the Hours.\r\n\r\nThe locality was probably the Elizabethan banqueting-house, which seems\r\nto have been repaired in 1604 (Reyher, 340). ‘The scene being drawn’\r\ndiscovered first an altar for Hymen and ‘a microcosm or globe’, which\r\nturned and disclosed the men maskers in a ‘mine’ or ‘grot’. On either\r\nside of the globe stood great statues of Hercules and Atlas. They bore\r\nup the ‘upper part of the scene’, representing clouds, which opened to\r\ndisclose the upper regions, whence the women descended on _nimbi_.\r\n\r\nEach set of maskers had a dance at entry. They then danced together a\r\nmeasure with strains ‘all notably different, some of them formed into\r\nletters very signifying to the name of the bridegroom’. This done,\r\nthey ‘dissolved’ and took forth others for measures, galliards, and\r\ncorantoes. After these ‘intermixed dances’ came ‘their last dances’,\r\nand they departed in a bridal procession with an epithalamion.\r\n\r\nThe mask was in honour of the wedding of the Earl of Essex and Frances\r\nHoward, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, and was probably given by\r\ntheir friends. The only Household expenses appear to have been for\r\nthe making ready of the room (Reyher, 520), but Lady Rutland’s share\r\nseems to have cost the Earl over £100 (_Hist. MSS. Rutland Accounts_,\r\niv. 457). The dancers were the Countesses of Montgomery, Bedford, and\r\nRutland, the Ladies Knollys, Berkeley, Dorothy Hastings, and Blanch\r\nSomerset, and Mrs. A. Sackville, with the Earls of Montgomery and\r\nArundel, Lords Willoughby and Howard de Walden, Sir James Hay, Sir\r\nThomas Howard, Sir Thomas Somerset, and Sir John Ashley. The ‘design\r\nand act’ and the device of the costumes were by Inigo Jones, the songs\r\nby Alphonso Ferrabosco, and the dances by Thomas Giles.\r\n\r\nOn the next day followed a Barriers, in which, after a dialogue by\r\nJonson between Truth and Opinion, sixteen knights fought on the side of\r\neither disputant (cf. vol. i, p. 146).\r\n\r\nThe following account was sent by John Pory to Sir Robert Cotton on 7\r\nJan. (_B.M. Cotton MS. Julius_ C. iii. 301, printed in Goodman, ii.\r\n124; Collier, i. 350; Birch, i. 42; Sullivan, 199):\r\n\r\n   ‘I haue seen both the mask on Sunday and the barriers on Mundy\r\n   night. The Bridegroom carried himself as grauely and gracefully\r\n   as if he were of his fathers age. He had greater guiftes giuen\r\n   him then my lord Montgomery had, his plate being valued at\r\n   3000£ and his jewels, mony and other guiftes at 1600£ more.\r\n   But to returne to the maske; both Inigo, Ben, and the actors\r\n   men and women did their partes with great commendation. The\r\n   conceite or soule of the mask was Hymen bringing in a bride\r\n   and Juno pronuba’s priest a bridegroom, proclaiming those two\r\n   should be sacrificed to nuptial vnion, and here the poet made\r\n   an apostrophe to the vnion of the kingdoms. But before the\r\n   sacrifice could be performed, Ben Jonson turned the globe of\r\n   the earth standing behind the altar, and within the concaue\r\n   sate the 8 men maskers representing the 4 humours and the fower\r\n   affections which leapt forth to disturb the sacrifice to vnion;\r\n   but amidst their fury Reason that sate aboue them all, crowned\r\n   with burning tapers, came down and silenced them. These eight\r\n   together with Reason their moderatresse mounted aboue their\r\n   heades, sate somewhat like the ladies in the scallop shell the\r\n   last year. Aboue the globe of erth houered a middle region of\r\n   cloudes in the center wherof stood a grand consort of musicians,\r\n   and vpon the cantons or hornes sate the ladies 4 at one corner,\r\n   and 4 at another, who descended vpon the stage, not after the\r\n   stale downright perpendicular fashion, like a bucket into a\r\n   well; but came gently sloping down. These eight, after the\r\n   sacrifice was ended, represented the 8 nuptial powers of Juno\r\n   pronuba who came downe to confirme the vnion. The men were clad\r\n   in crimzon and the weomen in white. They had euery one a white\r\n   plume of the richest herons fethers, and were so rich in jewels\r\n   vpon their heades as was most glorious. I think they hired and\r\n   borrowed all the principal jewels and ropes of perle both in\r\n   court and citty. The Spanish ambassador seemed but poore to\r\n   the meanest of them. They danced all variety of dances, both\r\n   seuerally and promiscue; and then the women took in men as\r\n   namely the Prince (who danced with as great perfection and as\r\n   setled a maiesty as could be deuised) the Spanish ambassador,\r\n   the Archdukes, Ambassador, the Duke, etc., and the men gleaned\r\n   out the Queen, the bride, and the greatest of the ladies. The\r\n   second night the barriers were as well performed by fifteen\r\n   against fifteen; the Duke of Lennox being chieftain on the one\r\n   side, and my Lord of Sussex on the other.’\r\n\r\n                    _Mask of Beauty. 10 Jan. 1608_\r\n\r\n_S.

Which was of Beautie; Was presented in the\r\nsame Court, at White-Hall, on the Sunday night after the Twelfth Night.\r\n1608. [Part of F_{1}.] The maskers, in orange-tawny and silver and\r\ngreen and silver, were the twelve Daughters of Niger of the Mask of\r\nBlackness, now laved white, with four more; the torchbearers Cupids;\r\nthe presenters January, Boreas, Vulturnus, Thamesis; the musicians\r\nEchoes and Shades of old Poets.\r\n\r\nThe locality was the new banqueting-house at Whitehall. January was\r\nthroned in midst of the house. The curtain, representing Night,\r\nwas drawn to discover the maskers on a Throne of Beauty, borne by a\r\nfloating isle.\r\n\r\nThe maskers gave two dances, which were repeated at the King’s request,\r\nand then danced ‘with the lords’. They danced galliards and corantoes.\r\nThey then gave a third dance, and a fourth, which took them into their\r\nthrone again.\r\n\r\nThis was a Queen’s mask, danced by the Queen, Arabella Stuart, the\r\nCountesses of Arundel, Derby, Bedford, and Montgomery, and the Ladies\r\nElizabeth Guildford, Katherine Petre, Anne Winter, Windsor, Anne\r\nClifford, Mary Neville, Elizabeth Hatton, Elizabeth Gerard, Chichester,\r\nand Walsingham. The torchbearers were ‘chosen out of the best and\r\ningenious youth of the Kingdom’. The scene was ‘put in act’ by the\r\nKing’s master carpenter. Thomas Giles made the dances and played\r\nThamesis.\r\n\r\nThe mask was announced by 9 Dec. (_V. P._ xi. 74). On 10 Dec. La\r\nBoderie (ii. 490) reported that it would cost 6,000 or 7,000 crowns,\r\nand that nearly all the ladies invited by the Queen to take part in\r\nit were Catholics. Anne’s preparations were in swing before 17 Dec.\r\n(_V. P._ xi. 76). On 22 Dec. La Boderie reported (iii. 6) that he had\r\nunderestimated the cost, which would not be less than 30,000 crowns,\r\nand was causing much annoyance to the Privy Council. On 31 Dec. Donne\r\n(_Letters_, i. 182) intended to deliver a letter ‘when the rage of the\r\nmask is past’. Lord Arundel notes his wife’s practising early in Jan.\r\n(Lodge, App. 124). The original date was 6 Jan. ‘The Mask goes forward\r\nfor Twelfth-day’, wrote Chamberlain to Carleton on 5 Jan. (_S. P. D.\r\nJac. I_, xxxi. 2; Birch, i. 69), ‘though I doubt the new room will be\r\nscant ready’. But on 8 Jan. (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, xxxi. 4; Birch, i. 71)\r\nhe wrote again:\r\n\r\n   ‘We had great hopes of having you here this day, and then I\r\n   would not have given my part of the mask for any of their\r\n   places that shall be present, for I suppose you and your lady\r\n   would find easily passage, being so befriended; for the show is\r\n   put off till Sunday, by reason that all things are not ready.\r\n   Whatsoever the device may be, and what success they may have in\r\n   their dancing, yet you would have been sure to have seen great\r\n   riches in jewels, when one lady, and that under a baroness, is\r\n   said to be furnished far better then a hundred thousand pounds.\r\n   And the Lady Arabella goes beyond her; and the queen must not\r\n   come behind.’\r\n\r\nThe delay was really due to ambassadorial complications, which are\r\nreported by Giustinian (_V. P._ xi. 83, 86) and very fully by La\r\nBoderie (iii. 1–75; cf. Sullivan, 35, 201). The original intention was\r\nto invite the Spanish and Venetian, but not the French and Flemish\r\nambassadors. This, according to Giustinian, offended La Boderie,\r\nbecause Venice was ‘the nobler company’. But the real sting lay in\r\nthe invitation to Spain. This was represented to La Boderie about 23\r\nDec. as the personal act of Anne, in the face of a remonstrance by\r\nJames on the ground of the preference already shown to Spain in 1605.\r\nLa Boderie replied that he had already been slighted at the King of\r\nDenmark’s visit, that the mask was a public occasion, and that Henri\r\nwould certainly hold James responsible. A few days later he was told\r\nthat James was greatly annoyed at his wife’s levity, and would ask\r\nhim and the Venetian ambassador to dinner; but La Boderie refused to\r\naccept this as a compliment equivalent to seeing the Queen dance,\r\nand supping with the King before 10,000 persons. He urged that both\r\nambassadors or neither should be invited, and hinted that, if Anne was\r\nso openly Spanish in her tendencies, Henri might feel obliged to leave\r\nthe mission in charge of a secretary. An offer was made to invite La\r\nBoderie’s wife, but this he naturally refused. The Council tried in\r\nvain to make Anne hear reason, but finally let the mask proceed, and\r\ncountered Henri diplomatically by calling his attention to the money\r\ndebts due from France to England. Meanwhile Giustinian had pressed for\r\nhis own invitation in place of the Flemish ambassador, and obtained it.\r\nThe Spanish and Venetian ambassadors were therefore present. La Boderie\r\nreported that much attention was paid to Giustinian, and little to the\r\nSpanish ambassador, and also that James was so angry with Anne that he\r\nleft for a hunting trip the next day without seeing her. Giustinian\r\nadmired the mask, which was, James told him (_V. P._ xi. 86), ‘to\r\nconsecrate the birth of the Great Hall, which his predecessors had\r\nleft him built merely in wood, but which he had converted into stone’.\r\nProbably this is the mask described in a letter of Lady Pembroke to\r\nLord Shrewsbury calendared without date among letters of 1607–8 in\r\nLodge, iii, App. 121. On 28 Jan. the Spanish ambassador invited the\r\nfifteen ladies who had danced to dinner (Lodge, iii. 223; La Boderie,\r\niii. 81). On 29 Jan. Lord Lisle wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury\r\nregretting that he could not send him the verses, because Ben Jonson\r\nwas busy writing more for the Haddington wedding (Lodge, App. 102).\r\n\r\nA warrant for expenses was signed 11 Dec. (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, xxviii).\r\nA payment was made to Bethell (Reyher, 520).\r\n\r\n       _Lord Haddington’s Mask_ [_The Hue and Cry after Cupid_].\r\n                             _9 Feb. 1608_\r\n\r\nN.D.

[Part of F_{1}.] The maskers were the twelve Signs of the Zodiac\r\nin carnation and silver; the antimaskers Cupid and twelve Joci and\r\nRisus, who danced ‘with their antic faces’; the presenters Venus, the\r\nGraces and Cupid, Hymen, Vulcan and the Cyclopes; the musicians Priests\r\nof Hymen, while the Cyclopes beat time with their sledges.\r\n\r\nPilasters hung with amorous trophies supported gigantic figures of\r\nTriumph and Victory ‘in place of the arch, and holding a gyrlond of\r\nmyrtle for the key’. The scene was a steep red cliff (Radcliffe), over\r\nwhich clouds broke for the issue of the chariot of Venus. After the\r\nantimasque, the cliff parted, to discover the maskers in a turning\r\nsphere of silver. The maskers gave four dances, interspersed with\r\nverses of an epithalamion. The mask was given by the maskers, seven\r\nScottish and five English lords and gentlemen, the Duke of Lennox,\r\nthe Earls of Arundel, Pembroke, and Montgomery, Lords D’Aubigny, De\r\nWalden, Hay, and Sanquhar, the Master of Mar, Sir Robert Rich, Sir John\r\nKennedy, and Mr. Erskine. (Quarto and Lodge, iii. 223.) The ‘device and\r\nact of the scene’ were supplied by Inigo Jones, the tunes by Alphonso\r\nFerrabosco, and two dances each by Hierome Herne and Thomas Giles, who\r\nalso beat time as Cyclopes.\r\n\r\nRowland White told Lord Shrewsbury on 26 Jan. that the mask was ‘now\r\nthe only thing thought upon at court’, and would cost the maskers about\r\n£300 a man (Lodge, iii. 223). Jonson was busy with the verses on 29\r\nJan. (Lodge, App. 102).\r\n\r\nSussex and Haddington intended to ask the French ambassador both\r\nto the wedding dinner and to the mask and banquet, but the Lord\r\nChamberlain, having Spanish sympathies, would not consent. In the end\r\nhe was asked by James himself to the mask and banquet, at which Prince\r\nHenry would preside. He accepted, and suggested that Henri should\r\npresent Haddington with a ring, but this was not done. He thought the\r\nmask ‘assez maigre’, but Anne was very gracious, and James regretted\r\nthat etiquette did not allow him to sit at the banquet in person. La\r\nBoderie’s wife and daughter, who danced with the Duke of York, were\r\nalso present. Unfortunately he did not receive in time an instruction\r\nfrom Paris to keep away if the Flemish ambassador was asked, and did\r\nnot protest against this invitation on his own responsibility, partly\r\nout of annoyance with the Venetian for attending the Queen’s mask\r\nwithout him, and partly for fear of losing his own invitation. The\r\nFleming had had far less consideration than himself (La Boderie, iii.\r\n75–144). So both the French and the Flemish ambassador were present,\r\nwith two princes of Saxony (_V. P._ xi. 97).\r\n\r\nEnglish criticisms were more kindly than La Boderie’s. Sir Henry\r\nSaville described it to Sir Richard Beaumont on the same night as a\r\n‘singular brave mask’, at which he had been until three in the morning\r\n(_Beaumont Papers_, 17), and Chamberlain wrote to Carleton on 11 Feb.\r\n(_S. P. D. Jac. I_, xxxi. 26; Birch, i. 72): ‘I can send you no perfect\r\nrelation of the marriage nor mask on Tuesday, only they say all,\r\nbut especially the motions, were well performed; as Venus, with her\r\nchariot drawn by swans, coming in a cloud to seek her son; who with his\r\ncompanions, Lusus, Risus, and Janus [? Jocus], and four or five more\r\nwags, were dancing a matachina, and acted it very antiquely, before the\r\ntwelve signs, who were the master maskers, descended from the zodiac,\r\nand played their parts more gravely, being very gracefully attired.’\r\n\r\n                     _Mask of Queens. 2 Feb. 1609_\r\n\r\n[_MSS._] (a) _B.M.

Collier, _Five Court Masques_ (1848, _Sh. Soc._ from\r\n_Royal MS._).\r\n\r\nJonson prefaces that ‘because Her Majesty (best knowing that a\r\nprincipal part of life in these spectacles lay in their variety) had\r\ncommanded me to think on some dance, or shew, that might precede\r\nhers, and have the place of a foil, or false masque: I was careful\r\nto decline, not only from others, but mine own steps in that kind,\r\nsince the last year, I had an antimasque of boys; and therefore now\r\ndevised that twelve women, in the habit of hags or witches, sustaining\r\nthe persons of Ignorance, Suspicion, Credulity, &c., the opposites to\r\ngood Fame, should fill that part, not as a masque, but as a spectacle\r\nof strangeness’ [it is called a ‘maske’ in the programme] ‘producing\r\nmultiplicity of gesture, and not unaptly sorting with the current and\r\nwhole fall of the device’.\r\n\r\nThe maskers, in various habits, eight designs for which are in _Sh.\r\nEngland_, ii. 311, were Bel-Anna and eleven other Queens, who were\r\nattended by torchbearers; the antimaskers eleven Hags and their dame\r\nAte; the presenters Perseus or Heroic Virtue and Fame.\r\n\r\nThe locality was the new banqueting-house at Whitehall (_T. of C.\r\nAcct._, quoted by Sullivan, 54). The scene at first represented a\r\nHell, whence the antimask issued. In the middle of a ‘magical dance’\r\nit vanished at a blast of music, ‘and the whole face of the scene\r\naltered’, becoming the House of Fame, a ‘_machina versatilis_’, which\r\nshowed first Perseus and the maskers and then Fame. Descending, the\r\nmaskers made their entry in three chariots, to which the Hags were\r\nbound. They danced their first and second dances; then ‘took out the\r\nmen, and danced the measures’ for nearly an hour. After an interval for\r\na song, came their third dance, ‘graphically disposed into letters,\r\nand honouring the name of the most sweet and ingenious Prince, Charles\r\nDuke of York’. Galliards and corantoes followed, and after their ‘last\r\ndance’ they returned in their chariots to the House of Fame.\r\n\r\nThis was a Queen’s mask, danced by the Queen, the Countesses of\r\nArundel, Derby, Huntingdon, Bedford, Essex, and Montgomery, the\r\nViscountess Cranborne, and the Ladies Elizabeth Guildford, Anne Winter,\r\nWindsor, and Anne Clifford. Inigo Jones was responsible for the attire\r\nof the Hags, and ‘the invention and architecture of the whole scene and\r\nmachine’; Alphonso Ferrabosco for the airs of the songs; Thomas Giles\r\nfor the third dance, and Hierome Herne for the dance of Hags. John\r\nAllen, ‘her Majesty’s servant’, sang a ditty between the measures and\r\nthe third dance.\r\n\r\nAs early as 14 Nov. Donne wrote to Sir Henry Goodyere (_Letters_, i.\r\n199), ‘The King ... hath left with the Queen a commandment to meditate\r\nupon a masque for Christmas, so that they grow serious about that\r\nalready’. The performance was originally intended for 6 Jan. (_V. P._\r\nxi. 219), but on 10 Jan. Chamberlain wrote to Carleton (Birch, i.\r\n87), ‘The mask at court is put off till Candlemas, as it is thought\r\nthe Spaniard may be gone, for the French ambassador hath been so long\r\nand so much neglected, that it is doubted more would not be well\r\nendured’. The intrigues which determined this delay are described in\r\nthe diplomatic correspondence of the French and Venetian ambassadors\r\n(La Boderie, iv. 104, 123, 136, 145, 175, 228; _V. P._ xi. 212, 219,\r\n222, 231, 234; cf. Sullivan, 47, 212). Hints of a _rapprochement_\r\nbetween France and Spain had made James anxious to conciliate Henri IV.\r\nEven Anne had learnt discretion, and desired that La Boderie should\r\nbe present at the mask. He was advised by Salisbury to ask for an\r\ninvitation, which he did, through his wife and Lady Bedford. He had\r\ninstructions from Henri to retire from Court and leave a secretary\r\nin charge if his master’s dignity was compromised. Unfortunately\r\nthe Spanish ambassador leiger was reinforced by an ambassador\r\nextraordinary, Don Fernandez de Girone, and took advantage of this\r\nto press on his side for an invitation. Etiquette gave a precedence\r\nto ambassadors extraordinary, and all that could be done was to wait\r\nuntil Don Fernandez was gone. This was not until 1 Feb. La Boderie was\r\nat the mask, and treated with much courtesy. He excused himself from\r\ndancing, but the Duke of York took out his daughter, and he supped\r\nwith the King and the princes. He found the mask ‘fort riche, et s’il\r\nm’est loisible de le dire, plus superbe qu’ingenieux’. He also thought\r\nthat of the ‘intermédes’ there were ‘trop et d’assez tristes’. The\r\nSpanish influence, however, was sufficiently strong, when exercised on\r\nbehalf of Flanders, to disappoint the Venetian ambassador of a promised\r\ninvitation, and La Boderie was the only diplomatic representative\r\npresent. Anne asked Correr to come privately, but this he would not do,\r\nand she said she should trouble herself no more about masks.\r\n\r\nIt was at first intended to limit the cost of the mask to £1,000, but\r\non 27 Nov. Sir Thomas Lake wrote to Salisbury that the King would\r\nallow a ‘reasonable encrease’ upon this, and had agreed that certain\r\nlords should sign and allow bills for the charges (_S. P. D. Jac. I_,\r\nxxxvii. 96, printed and misdated 1607 in Sullivan, 201). This duty\r\nwas apparently assigned to Lord Suffolk as Lord Chamberlain and Lord\r\nWorcester as Master of the Horse, in whose names a warrant was issued\r\non 1 Dec. (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, xxxviii. 1). The financial documents\r\ncited by Reyher, 520, suggest that the actual payments passed through\r\nthe hands of Inigo Jones and Henry Reynolds. Reyher, 72, reckons the\r\ntotal cost at near £5,000. This seems very high. A contemporary writer,\r\nW. Ffarrington (_Chetham Soc._ xxxix. 151), gives the estimate of ‘them\r\nthat had a hand in the business as “at the leaste two thousand pounde”’.\r\n\r\n                _Oberon, the Faery Prince. 1 Jan. 1611_\r\n\r\n1616. Oberon the Faery Prince. A Masque of Prince Henries. _W. Stansby,\r\nsold by Richard Meighen._ [Part of F_{1}.]\r\n\r\nThe maskers were Oberon and his Knights, accompanied by the Faies,\r\n‘some bearing lights’; the antimaskers Satyrs; the presenters Sylvans;\r\nsome of the musicians Satyrs and Faies.\r\n\r\nThis was ‘a very stately maske ... in the beautifull roome at\r\nWhitehall, which roome is generally called the Banquetting-house; and\r\nthe King new builded it about foure yeeres past’ (Stowe, _Annales_,\r\n910). ‘The first face of the scene’ was a cliff, from which the\r\nantimask issued. The scene opened to discover the front of a palace,\r\nand this again, after ‘an antick dance’ ended by the crowing of the\r\ncock, to disclose ‘the nation of Faies’, with the maskers on ‘sieges’\r\nand Oberon in a chariot drawn by two white bears. ‘The lesser Faies’\r\ndanced; then came a first and second ‘masque-dance’, then ‘measures,\r\ncorantos, galliards, etc.’, and finally a ‘last dance into the work’.\r\n\r\nThis was a Prince’s mask, and clearly Henry was Oberon, but the names\r\nof the other maskers are not preserved.\r\n\r\nHenry’s preparation for a mask is mentioned on 15 Nov. by Correr, who\r\nreports that he would have liked it to be on horseback, if James had\r\nconsented (_V. P._ xii. 79), on 3 Dec. by Thomas Screven (_Rutland\r\nMSS._ iv. 211), ‘The Prince is com to St. James and prepareth for a\r\nmask’, and on 15 Dec. by John More (Winwood, iii. 239), ‘Yet doth the\r\nPrince make but one mask’.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic tendency at this time was to detach France from growing\r\nrelations from Spain, and it was intended that both the masks of the\r\nwinter 1610–11 should serve to entertain the Marshal de Laverdin,\r\nexpected as ambassador extraordinary from Paris for the signature of a\r\ntreaty. But the Regent Marie de Médicis was not anxious to emphasize\r\nthe occasion, and the Marshal did not arrive in time for the Prince’s\r\nmask, which took place on 1 Jan. ‘It looked’, says Correr, ‘as though\r\nhe did not understand the honour done him by the King and the Prince.’\r\nThe Spanish and Venetian ambassadors were therefore invited, and were\r\npresent. The Dutch ambassador was invited, but professed illness, to\r\navoid complications with the Spaniard. Correr found the mask ‘very\r\nbeautiful throughout, very decorative, but most remarkable for the\r\ngrace of the Prince’s every movement’ (_Rutland MSS._ i. 426; _V. P._\r\nxii. 101, 106; cf. Sullivan, 61).\r\n\r\nNone of the above notices in fact identify Henry’s mask of 1 Jan. 1611\r\nwith the undated _Oberon_, but proof is forthcoming from an Exchequer\r\npayment of May 1611 for ‘the late Princes barriers and masks’ (text in\r\nReyher, 511) which specifies ‘the Satires and faeries’. The amount was\r\n£247 9_s._, and the items include payments to composers, musicians, and\r\nplayers. We learn that [Robert] Johnson and [Thomas] Giles provided\r\nthe dances, and Alphonse [Ferrabosco] singers and lutenists, that the\r\nviolins were Thomas Lupo the elder, Alexander Chisan, and Rowland\r\nRubidge, and that ‘xiij^n Holt boyes’ were employed, presumably as\r\nfays. There is a sum of £15 for ‘players imployed in the maske’ and\r\n£15 more for ‘players imployed in the barriers’, about which barriers\r\nno more is known. This account, subscribed by Sir Thomas Chaloner, by\r\nno means exhausts the expense of the mask. Other financial documents\r\n(Devon, 131, 134, 136; cf. Reyher, 521) show payments of £40 each to\r\nJonson and Inigo Jones, and £20 each to Ferrabosco, Jerome Herne, and\r\nConfess. These were from the Exchequer. An additional £16 to Inigo\r\nJones ‘devyser for the saide maske’ fell upon Henry’s privy purse,\r\ntogether with heavy bills to mercers and other tradesmen, amounting\r\nto £1,076 6_s._ 10_d._ (Cunningham, viii, from _Audit Office Declared\r\nAccts._). Correr had reported on 22 Nov. that neither of the masks of\r\nthis winter was to ‘be so costly as last year’s, which to say sooth\r\nwas excessively costly’ (_V. P._ xii. 86). The anticipation can hardly\r\nhave been fulfilled. I suppose that ‘last year’s’ means the _Tethys’\r\nFestival_ of June 1610, as no mask during the winter of 1609–10 is\r\ntraceable.\r\n\r\n          _Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly. 3 Feb. 1611_\r\n\r\n1616. A Masque of her Maiesties. Love freed from Ignorance and Folly.\r\n_W. Stansby, sold by Richard Meighen._ [Part of F_{1}.]\r\n\r\nThe maskers were eleven Daughters of the Morn, led by the Queen of the\r\nOrient; the antimaskers twelve Follies or She-Fools; the presenters\r\nCupid and Ignorance, a Sphinx; the musicians twelve Priests of the\r\nMuses, who also danced a measure, and three Graces, with others.\r\n\r\nThe locality was probably the banqueting-hall. The scene is not\r\ndescribed. There were two ‘masque-dances’, with ‘measures and revels’\r\nbetween them. This was a Queen’s mask, but the names of the maskers are\r\nnot preserved.\r\n\r\nJohn More wrote on 15 Dec. (Winwood, iii. 239), ‘Yet doth the Prince\r\nmake but one mask, and the Queen but two, which doth cost her majesty\r\nbut £600.’ Perhaps the writer was mistaken. Anne had not given more\r\nthan one mask in any winter, nor is there any trace of a second in that\r\nof 1610–11. Correr, on 22 Nov., anticipates one only, not to be so\r\ncostly as last year’s. It was to precede the Prince’s. It was, however,\r\nput off to Twelfth Night, and then again to Candlemas, ‘either because\r\nthe stage machinery is not in order, or because their Majesties thought\r\nit well to let the Marshal depart first’. This was Marshal de Laverdin,\r\nwhose departure from France as ambassador extraordinary was delayed\r\n(cf. _Mask of Oberon_). He was present at the mask when it actually\r\ntook place on 3 Feb., the day after Candlemas. Apparently the Venetian\r\nambassador was also invited. (_V. P._ xii. 86, 101, 106, 110, 115.)\r\n\r\nSeveral financial documents bearing on the mask exist (_S. P. D.\r\nJac. I_, lvii, Nov.; Devon, 135; Reyher, 509, 521), and show that\r\nthe contemplated £600 was in fact exceeded. An account signed by the\r\nEarls of Suffolk and Worcester, to whom the oversight of the charges\r\nwas doubtless assigned as Household officers, shows that in addition\r\nto £600 14_s._ 3_d._ spent in defraying the bills of Inigo Jones and\r\nothers and in rewards, there was a further expenditure of £118 7_s._\r\nby the Wardrobe, and even then no items are included for the dresses\r\nof the main maskers, which were probably paid for by the wearers. The\r\nrewards include £2 each to five boys who played the Graces, Sphinx, and\r\nCupid, and £1 each to the twelve Fools. This enables us to identify\r\nJonson’s undated mask with that of 1611. Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones had\r\n£40 each; Alphonso [Ferrabosco] £20 for the songs; [Robert] Johnson\r\nand Thomas Lupo £5 each for setting the songs to lutes and setting the\r\ndances to violins, and Confess and Bochan £50 and £20 for teaching the\r\ndances.\r\n\r\n                     _Love Restored. 6 Jan. 1612_\r\n\r\n1616. Love Restored, In a Masque at Court, by Gentlemen the Kings\r\nSeruants. _W. Stansby, sold by Richard Meighen._ [Part of F_{1}.]\r\n\r\nThe maskers were the ten Ornaments of Court--Honour, Courtesy, Valour,\r\nUrbanity, Confidence, Alacrity, Promptness, Industry, Hability,\r\nReality; the presenters Masquerado, Plutus, Robin Goodfellow, and\r\nCupid, who entered in a chariot attended by the maskers. There were\r\nthree dances. Jonson’s description is exceptionally meagre.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue finds its humour in the details of mask-presentation\r\nthemselves. Masquerado, in his vizard, apologizes for the absence of\r\nmusicians and the hoarseness of ‘the rogue play-boy, that acts Cupid’.\r\nPlutus criticizes the expense and the corruption of manners involved in\r\nmasks. Robin Goodfellow narrates his difficulties in obtaining access.\r\nHe has tried in vain to get through the Woodyard on to the Terrace, but\r\nthe Guard pushed him off a ladder into the Verge. The Carpenters’ way\r\nalso failed him. He has offered, or thought of offering, himself as an\r\n‘enginer’ belonging to the ‘motions’, but they were ‘ceased’; as an\r\nold tire-woman; as a musician; as a feather-maker of Blackfriars; as a\r\n‘bombard man’, carrying ‘bouge’ to country ladies who had fasted for\r\nthe fine sight since seven in the morning; as a citizen’s wife, exposed\r\nto the liberties of the ‘black-guard’; as a wireman or a chandler; and\r\nfinally in his own shape as ‘part of the Device’.\r\n\r\nThere are several financial documents relating to a mask at Christmas\r\n1611, for which funds were issued to one Meredith Morgan (_S. P. D.\r\nJac. I_, lxvii, Dec.; lxviii, Jan.; Reyher, 521). The Revels Account\r\n(Cunningham, 211) records a ‘princes Mask performed by Gentelmen of his\r\nHigh [ ]’ on 6 Jan. 1612. According to Chamberlain, the Queen was at\r\nGreenwich ‘practising for a new mask’ on 20 Nov., but this was put off\r\nin December as ‘unseasonable’ so soon after the death of the Queen of\r\nSpain (Birch, i. 148, 152). Jonson does not date _Love Restored_, but\r\nDr. Brotanek has successfully assigned it to 1611–12 on the ground of\r\nits reference to ‘the Christmas cut-purse’, of whom Chamberlain wrote\r\nto Carleton on 31 Dec. 1611 that ‘a cut-purse, taken in the Chapel\r\nRoyal, will be executed’ (Brotanek, 347; cf. _S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxvii.\r\n117, and _Bartholomew Fair_ (1614), III. v. 132). This was one John\r\nSelman, executed on 7 Jan. 1612 for picking the pocket of Leonard\r\nBarry, servant to Lord Harington, on Christmas Day (Rye, 269). I may\r\nadd that Robin Goodfellow, when pretending to be concerned with the\r\nmotions, was asked if he were ‘the fighting bear of last year’, and\r\nthat the chariot of Oberon on 1 Jan. 1611 was drawn by white bears.\r\nThere is, of course, nothing inconsistent in a Prince’s mask being\r\nperformed by King’s servants, and the ‘High[ness]’ of the Revels\r\nAccount may mean James, just as well as Henry. Simpson (_E. M._ 1.\r\nxxxiv) puts _Love Restored_ in 1613–14, as connected with the tilt (cf.\r\np. 393), but there is no room for it (cf. p. 246).\r\n\r\n                    _The Irish Mask. 29 Dec. 1613_\r\n\r\n1616. The Irish Masque at Court, by Gentlemen the Kings Servants. _W.\r\nStansby, sold by Richard Meighen._ [Part of F_{1}.]\r\n\r\nThe maskers were twelve Irish Gentlemen, first in mantles, then\r\nwithout; the antimaskers their twelve Footmen; the presenters a Citizen\r\nand a Gentleman; one of the musicians an Irish bard. The Footmen dance\r\n‘to the bag-pipe and other rude music’, after which the Gentlemen\r\n‘dance forth’ twice.\r\n\r\nThe antimaskers say that their lords have come to the bridal of ‘ty\r\nman Robyne’ to the daughter of ‘Toumaish o’ Shuffolke’, who has\r\nknocked them on the pate with his ‘phoyt stick’, as they came by.\r\nThere are also compliments to ‘King Yamish’, ‘my Mistresh tere’, ‘my\r\nlittle Maishter’, and ‘te vfrow, ty daughter, tat is in Tuchland’. It\r\nis therefore easy to supply the date which Jonson omits, as the mask\r\nclearly belongs to the series presented in honour of the wedding of\r\nRobert Earl of Somerset with the Earl of Suffolk’s daughter during\r\nthe Christmas of 1613–14. The list in Stowe, _Annales_, 928 (cf.\r\ns.v. Campion), includes one on 29 Dec. by ‘the Prince’s Gentlemen,\r\nwhich pleased the King so well that hee caused them to performe it\r\nagaine uppon the Monday following’. This was 3 Jan.; the 10 Jan. in\r\nNichols, ii. 718, is a misreading of the evidence in Chamberlain’s\r\nletters, which identify the mask as Jonson’s by a notice of the Irish\r\nelement. On 30 Dec. Chamberlain wrote to Alice Carleton (Birch, i.\r\n285), ‘yesternight there was a medley mask of five English and five\r\nScots, which are called the high dancers, amongst whom Sergeant Boyd,\r\none Abercrombie, and Auchternouty, that was at Padua and Venice, are\r\nesteemed the most principal and lofty, but how it succeeded I know\r\nnot’. Later in the letter he added, probably in reference to this and\r\nnot Campion’s mask, ‘Sir William Bowyer hath lost his eldest son, Sir\r\nHenry. He was a fine dancer, and should have been of the masque, but\r\noverheating himself with practising, he fell into the smallpox and\r\ndied.’ On 5 Jan. he wrote to Dudley Carleton (Birch, i. 287), ‘The----\r\nmaskers were so well liked at court the last week that they were\r\nappointed to perform again on Monday: yet their device, which was a\r\nmimical imitation of the Irish, was not pleasing to many, who think it\r\nno time, as the case stands, to exasperate that nation, by making it\r\nridiculous’. On the finance cf. s.v. Campion.\r\n\r\n         _Mercury Vindicated from the Alchemists. 6 Jan. 1615_\r\n\r\n1616. Mercury Vindicated from the Alchemists at Court by Gentlemen the\r\nKings Seruants. _W. Stansby, sold by Richard Meighen._ [Part of F_{1}.]\r\n\r\nThe maskers were twelve Sons of Nature; the first antimaskers\r\nAlchemists, the second Imperfect Creatures, in helms of limbecs; the\r\npresenters Vulcan, Cyclops, Mercury, Nature, and Prometheus, with a\r\nchorus of musicians.\r\n\r\nThe locality was doubtless Whitehall. The scene first discovered was\r\na laboratory. After the antimasks it changed to a bower, whence the\r\nmaskers descended for ‘the first dance’, ‘the main dance’, and, after\r\ndancing with the ladies, ‘their last dance’. Donne (_Letters_, ii. 65)\r\nwrote to Sir Henry Goodyere on 13 Dec. [1614], ‘They are preparing\r\nfor a masque of gentlemen, in which M^r. Villiers is and M^r. Karre\r\nwhom I told you before my Lord Chamberlain had brought into the\r\nbedchamber’. On 18 Dec. [1614] (ii. 66) he adds, ‘M^r. Villiers ...\r\nis here, practising for the masque’. The year-dates can be supplied\r\nby comparison with Chamberlain’s letters to Carleton. On 1 Dec. 1614\r\n(_S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxxviii. 65) Chamberlain wrote, ‘And yet for all\r\nthis penurious world we speake of a maske this Christmas toward which\r\nthe King gives 1500£ the principall motiue wherof is thought to be the\r\ngracing of younge Villers and to bring him on the stage’. It should\r\nbe borne in mind that there was at this time an intrigue amongst the\r\nCourt party opposed to Somerset and the Howards, including Donne’s\r\npatroness Lady Bedford, to put forward George Villiers, afterwards Duke\r\nof Buckingham, as a rival to the Earl of Somerset in the good graces of\r\nJames I. On 5 Jan. Chamberlain wrote again (_S. P. D. Jac. I_, lxxx. 1;\r\nBirch, i. 290, but there misdated), ‘Tomorrow night there is a mask at\r\ncourt, but the common voice and preparations promise so little, that\r\nit breeds no great expectation’; and on 12 Jan. (_S. P. D._ lxxx. 4;\r\nBirch, i. 356), ‘The only matter I can advertise ... is the success\r\nof the mask on Twelfth Night, which was so well liked and applauded,\r\nthat the King had it represented again the Sunday night after [8\r\nJan.] in the very same manner, though neither in device nor show was\r\nthere anything extraordinary, but only excellent dancing; the choice\r\nbeing made of the best, both English and Scots’. He then describes an\r\nambassadorial incident, which is also detailed in a report by Foscarini\r\n(_V. P._ xiii. 317) and by Finett, 19 (cf. Sullivan, 95). The Spanish\r\nambassador refused to appear in public with the Dutch ambassador,\r\nalthough it was shown that his predecessor had already done so, and in\r\nthe end both withdrew. The Venetian ambassador and Tuscan agent were\r\nalone present. An invitation to the French ambassador does not appear\r\nto have been in question.\r\n\r\nFinancial documents (Reyher, 523; _S. P. D._ lxxx, Mar.) show that one\r\nWalter James received Exchequer funds for the mask.\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure that Brotanek, 351, is right in identifying\r\n_Mercury Vindicated_ with the mask of January 1615 and _The Golden\r\nAge Restored_ with that of January 1616, but the evidence is so\r\ninconclusive that it is not worth while to disturb his chronology.\r\n_Mercury Vindicated_ is not dated in the Folio, but it is printed next\r\nbefore _The Golden Age Restored_, which is dated ‘1615’. Now it is true\r\nthat the order of the Folio, as Brotanek points out, appears to be\r\nchronological; but it is also true that, at any rate for the masks, the\r\nyear-dates, by a practice characteristic of Jonson, follow Circumcision\r\nand not Annunciation style. One or other principle seems to have been\r\ndisregarded at the end of the Folio, and who shall say which? Brotanek\r\nattempts to support his arrangement by tracing topical allusions (_a_)\r\nin _Mercury Vindicated_ to Court ‘brabbles’ of 1614–15, (_b_) in _The\r\nGolden Age Restored_ to the Somerset _esclandre_. But there are always\r\n‘brabbles’ in courts, and I can find no references to Somerset at all.\r\nNor is it in the least likely that there would be any. _Per contra_, I\r\nmay note that Chamberlain’s description of the ‘device’ in 1615 as not\r\n‘extraordinary’ applies better to _The Golden Age Restored_ than to\r\n_Mercury Vindicated_.\r\n\r\n                _The Golden Age Restored. 1 Jan. 1616_\r\n\r\n1616. The Golden Age Restor’d. In a Maske at Court, 1615. by the Lords,\r\nand Gentlemen, the Kings Seruants. _W. Stansby, sold by Richard\r\nMeighen._ [Part of F_{1}.]\r\n\r\nThe maskers were Sons of Phoebus, Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate, Spenser, and\r\npresumably others; the antimaskers twelve Evils; the presenters Pallas,\r\nAstraea, the Iron Age, and the Golden Age, with a chorus of musicians.\r\n\r\nThe locality was doubtless Whitehall. Pallas descended, and the Evils\r\ncame from a cave, danced to ‘two drums, trumpets, and a confusion of\r\nmartial music’, and were turned to statues. The scene changed, and\r\nlater the scene of light was discovered. After ‘the first dance’ and\r\n‘the main dance’, the maskers danced with the ladies, and then danced\r\n‘the galliards and corantos’.\r\n\r\nFinett, 31 (cf. Sullivan, 237), tells us that ‘The King being desirous\r\nthat the French, Venetian, and Savoyard ambassadors should all be\r\ninvited to a maske at court prepared for New-years night, an exception\r\ncomming from the French, was a cause of deferring their invitation\r\ntill Twelfe night, when the Maske was to be re-acted, ... [They] were\r\nreceived at eight of the clock, the houre assigned (no supper being\r\nprepared for them, as at other times, to avoid the trouble incident)\r\nand were conducted to the privy gallery by the Lord Chamberlaine and\r\nthe Lord Danvers appointed (an honour more than had been formerly\r\ndone to Ambassadors Ordinary) to accompany them, the Master of the\r\nCeremonies being also present. They were all there placed at the maske\r\non the Kings right hand (not right out, but byas forward) first and\r\nnext to the King the French, next him the Venetian, and next him the\r\nSavoyard. At his Majesties left hand sate the Queen, and next her the\r\nPrince. The maske being ended, they followed his Majesty to a banquet\r\nin the presence, and returned by the way they entered: the followers\r\nof the French were placed in a seate reserved for them above over\r\nthe Kings right hand; the others in one on the left. The Spanish\r\nambassadors son, and the agent of the Arch-Duke (who invited himselfe)\r\nwere bestowed on the forme where the Lords sit, next beneath the\r\nBarons, English, Scotish, and Irish as the sonns of the Ambassador of\r\nVenice, and of Savoy had been placed the maske night before, but were\r\nthis night placed with their countreymen in the gallery mentioned.’\r\n\r\nFinancial documents (Reyher, 523; _S.

The Lady of the Lake is\r\n‘discovered’ and points to her lake and Merlin’s tomb. Arthur is\r\n‘discovered as a star above’. Merlin rises from his tomb. Their\r\nspeeches lament the decay of chivalry, and foretell its restoration,\r\nnow that James ‘claims Arthur’s seat’, through a knight, for whom\r\nArthur gives the Lady a shield. The Knight, ‘Meliadus, lord of the\r\nisles’, is then ‘discovered’ with his six assistants in a place\r\ninscribed ‘St. George’s Portico’. Merlin tells the tale of English\r\nhistory. Chivalry comes forth from a cave, and the barriers take place,\r\nafter which Merlin pays final compliments to the King and Queen, Henry,\r\nCharles, and Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nJonson does not date the piece, but it stands in F_{1} between the\r\n_Masque of Queens_ (2 Feb. 1609) and _Oberon_ (1 Jan. 1611), and\r\nthis, with the use of the name Meliadus, enables us to attach it to\r\nthe barriers of 6 Jan. 1610, of which there is ample record (Stowe,\r\n_Annales_, 574; Cornwallis, _Life of Henry_, 12; Birch, i. 102;\r\nWinwood, iii. 117; _V. P._ xi. 400, 403, 406, 410, 414). It was\r\nHenry’s first public appearance in arms, and he had some difficulty\r\nin obtaining the King’s consent, but His Majesty did not wish to\r\ncross him. The challenge, speeches for which are summarized by\r\nCornwallis, was on 31 Dec. in the presence-chamber, and until 6 Jan.\r\nHenry kept open table at St. James’s at a cost of £100 a day. With\r\nhim as challengers were the Duke of Lennox, the Earls of Arundel and\r\nSouthampton, Lord Hay, Sir Thomas Somerset, and Sir Richard Preston.\r\nThere were fifty-eight defendants, of whom prizes were adjudged to the\r\nEarl of Montgomery, Thomas Darcy, and Sir Robert Gordon. Each bout\r\nconsisted of two pushes with the pike and twelve sword-strokes, and the\r\nyoung prince gave or received that night thirty-two pushes and about\r\n360 strokes. Drummond of Hawthornden, who called his elegy on Henry\r\n_Tears on the Death of Moeliades_, explains the name as an anagram,\r\n_Miles a Deo_.\r\n\r\n                  _A Challenge at Tilt. 1 Jan. 1614_\r\n\r\n1616.

On 1 Jan. each came in\r\na chariot, with a company of ten knights, of whom the Bride’s were\r\nchallengers, and introduced and followed the tilting with speeches.\r\nFinally, Hymen resolved the dispute.\r\n\r\nThis tilt was on 1 Jan. 1614, after the wedding of the Earl of Somerset\r\non 26 Dec. 1613, as is clearly shown by a letter of Chamberlain (Birch,\r\ni. 287). The bride’s colours were murrey and white, the bridegroom’s\r\ngreen and yellow. The tilters included the Duke of Lennox, the\r\nEarls of Rutland, Pembroke, Montgomery, and Dorset, Lords Chandos,\r\nScrope, Compton, North, Hay, Norris, and Dingwall, Lord Walden and his\r\nbrothers, and Sir Henry Cary.\r\n\r\n                         _Lost Entertainment_\r\n\r\nWhen James dined with the Merchant Taylors on 16 July 1607 (cf. ch.\r\niv), Jonson wrote a speech of eighteen verses, for recitation by an\r\nAngel of Gladness.

His father, Francis Kyd, was a London\r\ncitizen and a scrivener. John Kyd, a stationer, may have been a\r\nrelative. Thomas entered the Merchant Taylors School in 1565, but there\r\nis no evidence that he proceeded to a university. It is possible that\r\nhe followed his father’s profession before he drifted into literature.\r\nHe seems to be criticized as translator and playwright in Nashe’s\r\nEpistle to Greene’s _Menaphon_ in 1589 (cf. App. C), and a reference\r\nthere has been rather rashly interpreted as implying that he was the\r\nauthor of an early play on Hamlet. About the same time his reputation\r\nwas made by _The Spanish Tragedy_, which came, with _Titus Andronicus_,\r\nto be regarded as the typical drama of its age. Ben Jonson couples\r\n‘sporting Kyd’ with ‘Marlowe’s mighty line’ in recording the early\r\ndramatists outshone by Shakespeare. Towards the end of his life Kyd’s\r\nrelations with Marlowe brought him into trouble. During the years\r\n1590–3 he was in the service of a certain noble lord for whose players\r\nMarlowe was in the habit of writing. The two sat in the same room\r\nand certain ‘atheistic’ papers of Marlowe’s got mixed up with Kyd’s.\r\nOn 12 May 1593 Kyd was arrested on a suspicion of being concerned in\r\ncertain ‘lewd and mutinous libels’ set up on the wall of the Dutch\r\nchurchyard; the papers were discovered and led to Marlowe (q.v.) being\r\narrested also. Kyd, after his release, wrote to the Lord Keeper, Sir\r\nJohn Puckering, to repudiate the charge of atheism and to explain away\r\nhis apparent intimacy with Marlowe. It is not certain who the ‘lord’\r\nwith whom the two writers were connected may have been; possibly\r\nLord Pembroke or Lord Strange, for whose players Marlowe certainly\r\nwrote; possibly also Henry Radcliffe, fourth Earl of Sussex, to whose\r\ndaughter-in-law Kyd dedicated his translation of _Cornelia_, after\r\nhis disgrace, in 1594. Before the end of 1594 Kyd had died intestate\r\nin the parish of St. Mary Colchurch, and his parents renounced the\r\nadministration of his goods.\r\n\r\n                             _Collection_\r\n\r\n1901.

Fleischer, _Bemerkungen über\r\nThomas Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy_ (1896).\r\n\r\nKyd’s authorship of the play is recorded by Heywood, _Apology_, 45\r\n(cf. App. C, No. lvii). The only direct evidence as to the date is Ben\r\nJonson’s statement in the Induction to _Bartholomew Fair_ (1614), ‘He\r\nthat will swear _Ieronimo_ or _Andronicus_ are the best plays yet,\r\nshall pass unexcepted at here as a man whose judgment shows it is\r\nconstant, and hath stood still these five and twenty or thirty years’.\r\nThis yields 1584–9. Boas, xxx, argues for 1585–7; W. Bang in _Englische\r\nStudien_, xxviii. 229, for 1589. The grounds for a decision are slight,\r\nbut the latter date seems to me the more plausible in the absence of\r\nany clear allusion to the play in Nashe’s (q.v.) _Menaphon_ epistle of\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nStrange’s men revived _Jeronymo_ on 14 March 1592 and played it\r\nsixteen times between that date and 22 Jan. 1593. I agree with Greg\r\n(_Henslowe_, ii. 150, 153) that by _Jeronymo_ Henslowe meant _The\r\nSpanish Tragedy_, and that the performances of it are distinguishable\r\nfrom those which the company was concurrently giving of a related piece\r\ncalled _Don Horatio_ or ‘the comedy of Jeronimo’, which is probably\r\nnot to be identified with the extant anonymous _1 Jeronimo_ (q.v.).\r\nOn 7 Jan. 1597 the play was revived by the Admiral’s and given twelve\r\ntimes between that date and 19 July. Another performance, jointly with\r\nPembroke’s, took place on 11 Oct. Finally, on 25 Sept. 1601 and 22 June\r\n1602, Henslowe made payments to Jonson, on behalf of the Admiral’s,\r\nfor ‘adicyons’ to the play. At first sight, it would seem natural to\r\nsuppose that these ‘adicyons’ are the passages (II. v. 46–133; III. ii.\r\n65–129; III. xii^a. 1–157; IV. iv. 168–217) which appear for the first\r\ntime in the print of 1602. But many critics have found it difficult\r\nto see Jonson’s hand in these, notably Castelain, 886, who would\r\nassign them to Webster. And as Henslowe marked the play as ‘n. e.’ in\r\n1597, it is probable that there was some substantial revision at that\r\ndate. There is a confirmation of this view in Jonson’s own mention\r\nof ‘the old Hieronimo (as it was first acted)’ in the induction to\r\n_Cynthia’s Revels_ (1600). Perhaps the 1597 revival motived Jonson’s\r\nquotation of the play by the mouth of Matheo in _E. M. I._ I. iv, and\r\nin _Satiromastix_, 1522, Dekker suggests that Jonson himself ‘took’st\r\nmad Ieronimoes part, to get service among the Mimickes’. Lines from\r\nthe play are also recited by the page in _Poetaster_, III. iv. 231. In\r\nthe Induction, 84, to Marston’s _Malcontent_ (1604) Condell explains\r\nthe appropriation of that play by the King’s from the Chapel with\r\nthis retort, ‘Why not Malevole in folio with us, as well as Jeronimo\r\nin decimo sexto with them’. Perhaps _1 Jeronimo_ is meant; in view of\r\nthe stage history of _The Spanish Tragedy_, as disclosed by Henslowe’s\r\ndiary, the King’s could hardly have laid claim to it.\r\n\r\nThe play was carried by English actors to Germany (Boas, xcix;\r\nCreizenach, xxxiii; Herz, 66, 76), and a German adaptation by Jacob\r\nAyrer is printed by Boas, 348, and with others in German and Dutch, in\r\nR.

Robertson, _The Problem of Hamlet_ (1919).\r\n\r\nThe existence of a play on Hamlet a decade or more before the end\r\nof the sixteenth century is established by Henslowe’s note of its\r\nrevival by the Admiral’s and Chamberlain’s on 11 June 1594 (cf. Greg,\r\n_Henslowe_, ii. 164), and some corroborative allusions, but its\r\nrelationship to Shakespeare’s play is wholly conjectural. The possible\r\ncoupling of ‘Kidde’ and ‘Hamlet’ in Nashe’s epistle to _Menaphon_ has\r\nled to many speculations as to Kyd’s authorship and as to the lines\r\non which the speculators think he would have treated the theme. Any\r\ndiscussion of these is matter for an account of _Hamlet_.\r\n\r\nKyd’s hand has also been sought in _Arden of Feversham_, _Contention\r\nof York and Lancaster_, _Edward III_, _1 Jeronimo_, _Leire_, _Rare\r\nTriumphs of Love and Fortune_, _Soliman and Perseda_, _Taming of A\r\nShrew_, and _True Tragedy of Richard III_ (cf. ch. xxiv), and in\r\nShakespeare’s _Titus Andronicus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURICE KYFFIN (?-1599).\r\n\r\nA Welshman by birth, he left the service of John Dee, with whom he\r\nafterwards kept up friendly relations, on 25 Oct. 1580 (_Diary_,\r\n10, 15, 48).

N. B._ and by Viscount Dillon in _Bucks.,\r\nBerks. and Oxon. Arch. Journ._, xii (1906) 65, may be supplemented from\r\nAubrey, ii. 30, J. H. Lea, _Genealogical Notes on the Family of Lee of\r\nQuarrendon_ (_Genealogist_, n.s. viii-xiv), and F. G. Lee in _Bucks.\r\nRecords_, iii. 203, 241; iv. 189, _The Lees of Quarrendon_ (_Herald and\r\nGenealogist_, iii. 113, 289, 481), and _Genealogy of the Family of Lee_\r\n(1884).]\r\n\r\nLee belonged to a family claiming a Cheshire origin, which had long\r\nbeen settled in Bucks. From 1441 they were constables and farmers of\r\nQuarrendon in the same county, and the manor was granted by Henry\r\nVIII to Sir Robert Lee, who was Gentleman Usher of the Chamber and\r\nafterwards Knight of the Body. His son Sir Anthony married Margaret,\r\nsister of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet. Their son Henry was born in\r\n1531, and Aubrey reports the scandal that he was ‘supposed brother to\r\nElizabeth’. He was page of honour to the King, and by 1550 Clerk of\r\nthe Armoury. He was knighted in 1553. By Sept. 1575 he was Master of\r\nthe Game at Woodstock (Dasent, ix. 23), and by 1577 Lieutenant of the\r\nmanor and park (Marshall, _Woodstock_, 160), holding ‘le highe lodge’\r\nand other royal houses in the locality. Probably he was concerned with\r\nthe foundation of Queen’s Day (cf. ch. i) in 1570, which certainly\r\noriginated near Oxford, and when the annual tilting on this day at\r\nWhitehall was instituted, Lee acted as Knight of the Crown until his\r\nretirement in 1590. He used as his favourite device a crowned pillar.\r\nHe took some part in the military enterprises of the reign, and in\r\n1578 became Master of the Armoury. In 1597 he was thought of as\r\nVice-Chamberlain, and on 23 April was installed as K.G. He was a great\r\nsheep-farmer and encloser of land, and a great builder or enlarger of\r\nhouses, including Ditchley Hall, four or five miles from Woodstock, in\r\nthe parish of Spelsbury, where he died on 12 Feb. 1611. By his wife,\r\nAnne, daughter of William Lord Paget, who died in 1590, he had two\r\nsons and a daughter, who all predeceased him. His will of 6 Oct. 1609\r\nprovides for the erection of a tomb in Quarrendon Chapel near his own\r\nfor ‘M^{rs}. Ann Vavasor alias Finch’. There are no tombs now, but the\r\ninscriptions on Lee’s tomb and on a tablet in the chancel, also not\r\npreserved, are recorded. The former says:\r\n\r\n    ‘In courtly justs his Soveraignes knight he was’,\r\n\r\nand the latter adds:\r\n\r\n   ‘He shone in all those fayer partes that became his profession\r\n   and vowes, honoring his highly gracious Mistris with reysing\r\n   those later Olympiads of her Courte, justs and tournaments ...\r\n   wherein still himself lead and triumphed.’\r\n\r\nThe writer is William Scott, who also, with Richard Lee, witnessed\r\nthe will. Anne Vavasour does not in fact appear to have been buried\r\nat Quarrendon. Aubrey describes her as ‘his dearest deare’, and says\r\nthat her effigy was placed at the foot of his on the tomb, and that the\r\nbishop threatened to have it removed. Anne’s tomb was in fact defaced\r\nas early as 1611. Anne was daughter of Sir Henry and sister of Sir\r\nThomas Vavasour of Copmanthorpe, Yorks. She was a new maid of honour\r\nwho ‘flourished like the lily and the rose’ in 1590 (Lodge, ii. 423).\r\nAnother Anne Vavasour came to Court as ‘newly of the beddchamber’\r\nafter being Lady Bedford’s ‘woman’, about July 1601 (Gawdy, 112,\r\nconjecturally dated; cf. vol. iv, p. 67). Anne Clifford tells us that\r\n‘my cousin Anne Vavisour’ was going with her mother Lady Cumberland and\r\nLady Warwick and herself to meet Queen Anne in 1603, and married Sir\r\nRichard Warburton the same year (Wiffen, ii. 69, 72). The Queen is said\r\nto have visited Sir Henry and his mistress at a lodge near Woodstock\r\ncalled ‘Little Rest’, now ‘Lee’s Rest’, in 1608. After Lee’s death his\r\nsuccessor brought an action against Anne and her brother for illegal\r\ndetention of his effects (_5 N. Q._ iii. 294), and the feud was\r\nstill alive and Anne had added other sins to her score in 1618, when\r\nChamberlain wrote (Birch, ii. 86):\r\n\r\n   ‘M^{rs}. Vavasour, old Sir Henry Lee’s woman, is like to be\r\n   called in question for having two husbands now alive. Young\r\n   Sir Henry Lee, the wild oats of Ireland, hath obtained the\r\n   confiscation of her, if he can prove it without touching her\r\n   life.’\r\n\r\nAubrey’s story that Lee’s nephew was disinherited in favour of ‘a\r\nkeeper’s sonne of Whitchwood-forest of his owne name, a one-eied young\r\nman, no kinne to him’, is exaggerated gossip. Lee entailed his estate\r\non a second cousin.\r\n\r\nI have brought together under Lee’s name two entertainments and\r\nfragments of at least one other, which ought strictly to be classed\r\nas anonymous, but with which he was certainly concerned, and to which\r\nhe may have contributed some of the ‘conceiptes, Himmes, Songes &\r\nEmblemes’, of which one of the fragments speaks.\r\n\r\n               _The Woodstock Entertainment.

It is accompanied by pen-and-ink drawings, and\r\npreceded by verses and an epistle to Elizabeth. The latter is dated\r\n‘first of January, 1576’ and signed ‘G. Gascoigne’. The English text\r\nis, with minor variations, that of the tale as printed in 1585. Its\r\nauthorship is not claimed by Gascoigne, who says that he has ‘turned\r\nthe eloquent tale of _Hemetes the Heremyte_ (wherw^{th} I saw yo^r\r\nlerned judgment greatly pleased at Woodstock) into latyne, Italyan and\r\nfrenche’, and contrasts his own ignorance with ‘thaucto^{rs} skyll’.]\r\n\r\n_S.

The t.p. is a modern type-facsimile, based\r\non the head-line and colophon (McKerrow, _Bibl. Evidence_, 306).]\r\n\r\n_Editions_ (_a_) from 1579, by J. Nichols, _Eliz._ i. 553 (1823), and\r\nW. C. Hazlitt, _Gascoigne_, ii. 135 (1870); (_b_) from _MS._ by J.\r\nW. Cunliffe, _Gascoigne_, ii. 473 (1910); (_c_) from 1585, by A. W.\r\nPollard (1910, partly printed 1903) and J. W. Cunliffe (1911, _M. L.\r\nA._ xxvi. 92).\r\n\r\nGascoigne’s manuscript is chiefly of value as fixing the locality of\r\nthe entertainment, which is not mentioned in the mutilated print of\r\n1585. The date can hardly be doubtful. Elizabeth spent considerable\r\nperiods at Woodstock in 1572, 1574, and 1575, but it so happens that\r\nonly in 1575 was she there on the 20th of a month (_vide infra_ and\r\nApp. B). Moreover, Laurence Humphrey’s _Oratio_ delivered at Woodstock\r\non 11 Sept. 1575 (Nichols, i. 590) refers to the entertainment in the\r\nphrase ‘an ... Gandina spectacula ... dabit’. The description takes\r\nthe form of a letter from an eyewitness, evidently not the deviser,\r\nand professing ignorance of Italian; not, therefore, Gascoigne, as\r\npointed out by Mr. Pollard. At the beginning of sig. B, Hemetes, a\r\nhermit, has evidently just interrupted a fight between Loricus and\r\nContarenus. He brings them, with the Lady Caudina, to a bower, where\r\nElizabeth is placed, and tells his Tale, of which the writer says,\r\n‘hee shewed a great proofe of his audacity, in which tale if you marke\r\nthe woords with this present world, or were acquainted with the state\r\nof the deuises, you should finde no lesse hidden then vttered, and no\r\nlesse vttered then shoulde deserue a double reading ouer, euen of those\r\n(with whom I finde you a companion) that haue disposed their houres to\r\nthe study of great matters’. The Tale explains how the personages have\r\ncome together. Contarenus loved Caudina, daughter of Occanon Duke of\r\nCambia. At Occanon’s request, an enchantress bore him away, and put him\r\nin charge of the blind hermit, until after seven years he should fight\r\nthe hardiest knight and see the worthiest lady in the world. Caudina,\r\nsetting out with two damsels to seek him, met at the grate of Sibilla\r\nwith Loricus, a knight seeking renown as a means to his mistress’s\r\nfavour. Sibilla bade them wander, till they found a land in all things\r\nbest, and with a Princess most worthy. Hemetes himself has been blinded\r\nby Venus for loving books as well as a lady, and promised by Apollo the\r\nrecovery of his sight, where most valiant knights fight, most constant\r\nlovers meet, and the worthiest lady looks on. Obviously it is all a\r\ncompliment to the worthiest lady. Thus the Tale ends. The Queen is\r\nnow led to the hermit’s abode, an elaborate sylvan banqueting-house,\r\nbuilt on a mound forty feet high, roofed by an oak, and hung with\r\npictures and posies of ‘the noble or men of great credite’, some of\r\nwhich the French ambassador made great suit to have. Here Elizabeth was\r\nvisited by ‘the Queen of the Fayry drawen with 6 children in a waggon\r\nof state’, who presented her with an embroidered gown. Couplets or\r\n‘posies’ set in garlands were also given to the Queen, to the Ladies\r\nDerby, Warwick, Hunsdon, Howard, Susan and Mary Vere, and to Mistresses\r\nSkidmore, Parry, Abbington, Sidney, Hopton, Katherine Howard, Garret,\r\nBridges, Burrough, Knowles, and Frances Howard. After a speech from\r\nCaudina, Elizabeth departed, as it was now dark, well pleased with her\r\nafternoon, and listening to a song from an oak tree as she went by.\r\nA somewhat cryptic passage follows. Elizabeth is said to have left\r\n‘earnest command that the whole in order as it fell, should be brought\r\nher in writing, which being done, as I heare, she vsed, besides her\r\nowne skill, the helpe of the deuisors, & how thinges were made I know\r\nnot, but sure I am her Maiesty hath often in speech some part hereof\r\nwith mirth at the remembrance.’ Then follows a comedy acted on ‘the 20\r\nday of the same moneth’, which ‘was as well thought of, as anye thing\r\never done before her Maiestie, not onely of her, but of the rest: in\r\nsuch sort that her Graces passions and other the Ladies could not [?\r\nbut] shew it selfe in open place more than euer hath beene seene’. The\r\ncomedy, in 991 lines of verse, is in fact a sequel to the Tale. In it\r\nOccanon comes to seek Caudina, who is persuaded by his arguments and\r\nthe mediation of Eambia, the Fairy Queen, to give up her lover for her\r\ncountry’s sake.\r\n\r\nPollard suggests Gascoigne as the author of the comedy, but of this\r\nthere is no external evidence. He also regards the intention of the\r\nwhole entertainment as being the advancement of Leicester’s suit.\r\nLeicester was no doubt at Woodstock, even before the Queen, for he\r\nwrote her a letter from there on 4 Sept. (_S. P. D. Eliz_. cv. 36);\r\nbut the undated letter which Pollard cites (cv. 38), and in which\r\nLeicester describes himself as ‘in his survey to prepare for her\r\ncoming’, probably precedes the Kenilworth visit. Pollard dates it 6\r\nSept., but Elizabeth herself seems to have reached Woodstock by that\r\ndate. Professor Cunliffe, on the other hand, thinks that the intention\r\nwas unfavourable to Leicester’s suit, and thus explains the stress\r\nlaid on Caudina’s renunciation of her lover for political reasons. I\r\ndoubt if there is any reference to the matter at all; it would have\r\nbeen dangerous matter for a courtly pen. Doubtless the writer of the\r\ndescription talks of ‘audacity’, in the Tale, not the comedy. But has\r\nhe anything more in mind than Sir Henry Lee, whom we are bound to find,\r\nhere as elsewhere, in Loricus, and his purely conventional worship of\r\nElizabeth?\r\n\r\n              _The Tilt Yard Entertainment. 17 Nov. 1590_\r\n\r\nThere are two contemporary descriptions, viz.:\r\n\r\n1590.

Segar, Honor, Military and Ciuill, Book iii, ch. 54, ‘The\r\nOriginall occasions of the yeerely Triumphs in England’.\r\n\r\nSegar’s account is reproduced by Nichols, _Eliz._ iii. 41, and both\r\nin the editions of Peele (q.v.) by Dyce and Bullen. A manuscript copy\r\nwith variants from the Q. is at St. John’s College, Oxford (F. S. Boas\r\nin _M. L. R._ xi. 300). _Polyhymnia_ mainly consists of a blank verse\r\ndescription and eulogy of the twenty-six tilters, in couples according\r\nto the order of the first running of six courses each, viz. Sir Henry\r\nLee and the Earl of Cumberland, Lord Strange and Thomas Gerrard, Lord\r\nCompton and Henry Nowell, Lord Burke and Sir Edward Denny, the Earl of\r\nEssex and Fulk Greville, Sir Charles Blount and Thomas Vavasor, Robert\r\nCarey and William Gresham, Sir William Knowles and Anthony Cooke, Sir\r\nThomas Knowles and Sir Philip Butler, Robert Knowles and Ralph Bowes,\r\nThomas Sidney and Robert Alexander, John Nedham and Richard Acton,\r\nCharles Danvers and Everard Digby. The colours and in some cases the\r\n‘device’ or ‘show’ are indicated. Lee is described as\r\n\r\n    Knight of the crown, in rich embroidery,\r\n    And costly fair caparison charged with crowns,\r\n    O’ershadowed with a withered running vine,\r\n    As who would say, ‘My spring of youth is past’,\r\n    In corselet gilt of curious workmanship.\r\n\r\nStrange entered ‘in costly ship’, with the eagle for his device; Essex\r\n\r\n    In stately chariot full of deep device,\r\n    Where gloomy Time sat whipping on the team,\r\n    Just back to back with this great champion.\r\n\r\nBlount’s badge was the sun, Carey’s a burning heart, Cooke’s a hand and\r\nheart,\r\n\r\n    And Life and Death he portray’d in his show.\r\n\r\nThe three Knowles brothers bore golden boughs. A final section of the\r\npoem describes how, after the running, Sir Henry Lee, ‘knight of the\r\nCrown’, unarmed himself in a pavilion of Vesta, and petitioned the\r\nQueen to allow him to yield his ‘honourable place’ to Cumberland, to\r\nwhom he gave his armour and lance, vowing to betake himself to orisons.\r\n\r\nSegar gives a fuller account of Lee’s fantasy. He had vowed, ‘in the\r\nbeginning of her happy reigne’, to present himself yearly in arms\r\non the day of Elizabeth’s accession. The courtiers, incited by his\r\nexample, had yearly assembled, ‘not vnlike to the antient Knighthood\r\ndella Banda in Spaine’, but in 1590, ‘being now by age ouertaken’,\r\nLee resigned his office to Cumberland. The ceremony took place ‘at\r\nthe foot of the staires vnder her gallery-window in the Tilt-yard at\r\nWestminster’, where Elizabeth sat with the French ambassador, Viscount\r\nTurenne. A pavilion, representing the Temple of the Vestal Virgins,\r\narose out of the earth. Within was an altar, with gifts for the queen;\r\nbefore the door a crowned pillar, embraced by an eglantine, and bearing\r\na complimentary inscription. As the knights approached, ‘M. Hales her\r\nmaiesties seruant’ sang verses beginning:\r\n\r\n    My golden locks time hath to siluer turned.\r\n\r\nThe vestals then gave the Queen a veil and a cloak and safeguard,\r\nthe buttons of which bore the ‘emprezes’ or ‘badges’ of many nobles,\r\nfriends of Lee, each fixed to an embroidered pillar, the last being\r\n‘like the character of _&c._’ Finally Lee doffed his armour, presented\r\nCumberland, armed and horsed him, and himself donned a side-coat of\r\nblack velvet and a buttoned cap of the country fashion. ‘After all\r\nthese ceremonies, for diuers dayes hee ware vpon his cloake a crowne\r\nembrodered, with a certaine motto or deuice, but what his intention\r\ntherein was, himselfe best knoweth.’\r\n\r\nThe Queen appointed Lee to appear yearly at the exercises, ‘to see,\r\nsuruey, and as one most carefull and skilfull to direct them’. Segar\r\ndwells on Lee’s virtues and valour, and concludes by stating that the\r\nannual actions had been performed by 1 Duke, 19 Earls, 27 Barons, 4\r\nKnights of the Garter, and above 150 other Knights and Esquires.\r\n\r\nOn 20 Nov. 1590 Richard Brakinbury wrote to Lord Talbot (Lodge,\r\nii. 419): ‘These sports were great, and done in costly sort, to her\r\nMajesty’s liking, and their great cost. To express every part, with\r\nsundry devices, is more fit for them that delight in them, than for me,\r\nwho esteemeth little such vanities, I thank God.’\r\n\r\nP. A. Daniel (_Athenaeum_ for 8 Feb. 1890) notes that a suit of armour\r\nin Lord Hothfield’s collection, which once belonged to Cumberland and\r\nis represented in certain portraits of him, is probably the identical\r\nsuit given him by Lee, as it bears a monogram of Lee’s name.\r\n\r\nThere has been some controversy about the authorship of the verses sung\r\nby ‘M. Hales’, who was Robert Hales, a lutenist. They appear, headed ‘A\r\nSonnet’, and unsigned, on a page at the end of _Polyhymnia_, and have\r\ntherefore been ascribed to Peele. The evidence, though inconclusive, is\r\nbetter than the wanton conjecture which led Mr. Bond to transfer them\r\nto Lyly (_Works_, i. 410). But a different version in _Rawl. Poet. MS._\r\n148, f. 19, is subscribed ‘q^d S^r Henry Leigh’, and some resemblances\r\nof expression are to be found in other verses assigned to Lee in R.\r\nDowland, _Musicall Banquet_ (1610), No. 8 (Bond, i. 517; Fellowes,\r\n459). It is not impossible that Lee himself may have been the author.\r\nOne of the pieces in the _Ferrers MS._ (_vide_ p. 406 _infra_) refers\r\nto his ‘himmes & songes’. If the verses, which also appear anonymously\r\nin J. Dowland, _First Booke of Songs or Ayres_ (1597, Fellowes, 418),\r\nare really Lee’s, Wyatt’s nephew was no contemptible poet. Finally,\r\nthere are echoes of the same theme in yet another set of anonymous\r\nverses in J. Dowland, _Second Book of Airs_ (1600, Fellowes, 422),\r\nwhich are evidently addressed to Lee.\r\n\r\n        _The Second Woodstock Entertainment, 20 Sept. 1592, and\r\n                           Other Fragments_\r\n\r\n[_MSS._] (_a_) _Ferrers MS._, a collection made by Henry Ferrers of\r\nBaddesley Clinton, Warwickshire (1549–1633).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Inner Temple Petyt MS._ 538, 43, ff. 284–363.\r\n\r\n[A collection of verses by Lady Pembroke, Sir John Harington, Francis\r\nBacon (q.v.) and others, bound as part of a composite MS.]\r\n\r\n(_c_) Viscount Dillon kindly informs me that a part of the\r\nentertainment, dated ‘20 Sept.’, is in his possession.\r\n\r\n_Editions_ (_Ferrers MS._ only) by W.

Bond, _Lyly_, i. 412, 453\r\n(1902).\r\n\r\nThe Ferrers MS. seems to contain ten distinct pieces, separated from\r\neach other only by headings, to which I have prefixed the numbers.\r\n\r\n(i) ‘A Cartell for a Challeng.’\r\n\r\nThree ‘strange forsaken knightes’ offer to maintain ‘that Loue is worse\r\nthan hate, his Subiectes worse than slaues, and his Rewarde worse than\r\nnaught: And that there is a Ladie that scornes Loue and his power, of\r\nmore vertue and greater bewtie than all the Amorouse Dames that be\r\nat this day in the worlde’. This cannot be dated. Sir Robert Carey\r\n(_Memoirs_, 33) tilted as a ‘forsaken knight’ on 17 Nov. 1593 (not\r\n1592, as stated by Brotanek, 60), but he was not a challenger, and was\r\nalone. The tone resembles that of Sir Henry Lee, and if he took part,\r\nthe date must be earlier than 1590.\r\n\r\n(ii) ‘Sir Henry Lee’s challenge before the Shampanie.’\r\n\r\nA ‘strange knight that warres against hope and fortune’ will maintain\r\nthe cause of Despair in a green suit.\r\n\r\nHamper explained ‘Shampanie’ as ‘the lists or field of contention, from\r\nthe French _campagne_’; but Segar, _Honor, Military and Ciuill_, 197,\r\nrecords, from an intercepted letter of ‘Monsieur de Champany ... being\r\nambassador in England for causes of the Low Countreys’, an occasion\r\non which Sir Henry Lee, ‘the most accomplished cavaliero I had euer\r\nseene’, broke lances with other gentlemen in his honour at Greenwich.\r\nM. de Champagny was an agent of the native Flemish Catholics, and\r\nvisited England in 1575 and 1585 (Froude, x. 360; xii. 39). As his\r\nletter named ‘Sir’ C. Hatton, who was knighted in 1578, the visit of\r\n1585 must be in question. The Court was at Greenwich from March to July\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\n(iii) ‘The Supplication of the Owld Knight.’\r\n\r\nA speech to the ‘serveres of this English Holiday, or rather Englandes\r\nHappie Daye’, in which a knight disabled by age, ‘yet once (thowe\r\nunwoorthie) your fellowe in armes, and first celebrator, in this kinde,\r\nof this sacred memorie of that blessed reigne’, begs them to ‘accepte\r\nto your fellowshippe this oneley sonne of mine’.\r\n\r\nThis is evidently a speech by Lee, on some 17 Nov. later than 1590.\r\nLee’s own sons died in childhood; probably the ‘son’ introduced was a\r\nrelative, but possibly only a ‘son’ in chivalry.\r\n\r\n(iv) ‘The Message of the Damsell of the Queene of Fayries.’\r\n\r\nAn ‘inchanted knight’ sends the Queen an image of Cupid. She is\r\nreminded how ‘at the celebrating the joyfull remembraunce of the most\r\nhappie daye of your Highnes entrance into Gouerment of this most\r\nnoble Islande, howe manie knightes determined, not far hence, with\r\nboulde hartes and broken launces, to paye there vowes and shewe theire\r\nprowes’. The ‘inchanted knight’ could not ‘chardge staffe, nor strike\r\nblowe’, but entered the jousts, and bore the blows of others.\r\n\r\nIf this has reference to the first celebration of 17 Nov., it may\r\nbe of near date to the Woodstock Entertainment of 1575 in which the\r\nfairy queen appeared. The knight, ‘full hardie and full haples’, is\r\nenchanted, but is not said to be old.\r\n\r\n(v) ‘The Olde Knightes Tale.’\r\n\r\n‘Not far from hence, nor verie long agoe,’ clearly in 1575, ‘the fayrie\r\nQueene the fayrest Queene saluted’, and the pleasures included ‘justes\r\nand feates of armed knightes’, and ‘enchaunted pictures’ in a bower.\r\nThe knight was bidden by the fairy queen to guard the pictures and keep\r\nhis eyes on the crowned pillar. He became ‘a stranger ladies thrall’,\r\nneglected this duty, and was cast into a deadly sleep. Now he is freed,\r\napparently through the intervention of Elizabeth, to whom the verses\r\nare addressed.\r\n\r\n(vi) ‘The Songe after Dinner at the two Ladies entrance.’\r\n\r\nCelebrates the setting free by a prince’s grace, of captive knights and\r\nladies, and bids farewell to inconstancy.\r\n\r\n(vii) ‘The Ladies Thankesgeuing for theire Deliuerie from Unconstancie.’\r\n\r\nA speech to the Queen, in the same vein as (vi), followed by a dialogue\r\nbetween Li[berty], or Inconstancy, and Constancy. This is datable in\r\n1592 from another copy printed in _The Phoenix Nest_ (1593), with\r\nthe title ‘An Excellent Dialogue betweene Constancie and Inconstancie:\r\nas it was by speech presented to her maiestie, in the last Progresse\r\nat Sir Henrie Leighes house’. Yet another copy, in _Inner Temple\r\nPetyt MS._ 538, 43, f. 299. ‘A Dialogue betweene Constancie and\r\nInconstancie spoken before the Queenes Majestie at Woodstock’ is\r\nascribed to ‘Doctor Edes’.\r\n\r\n(viii) ‘The last Songe.’\r\n\r\nA rejoicing on the coming of Eliza, with references to constancy and\r\ninconstancy, the aged knight, and the pillar and crown.\r\n\r\n(ix) ‘The second daies woorke where the Chaplayne maketh this\r\n   Relation.’\r\n\r\nAn Oration to the Queen by the chaplain of Loricus, ‘an owlde Knight,\r\nnow a newe religiouse Hermite’. The story of Loricus was once told [in\r\n1575] ‘by a good father of his owne coate, not farr from this coppies’.\r\nOnce he ‘rann the restles race of desire.... Sometymes he consorted\r\nwith couragious gentelmen, manifesting inward joyes by open justes, the\r\nyearly tribute of his dearest Loue. Somtimes he summoned the witnesse\r\nof depest conceiptes, Himmes & Songes & Emblemes, dedicating them to\r\nthe honor of his heauenlye mistres’. Retiring, through envy and age,\r\nto the country, he found the speaker at a homely cell, made him his\r\nchaplain, and built for their lodging and that of a page ‘the Crowne\r\nOratory’, with a ‘Piller of perpetual remembraunce’ as his device\r\non the entrance. Here he lies, at point of death, and has addressed\r\nhis last testament to the Queen. This is in verse, signed ‘Loricus,\r\ncolumnae coronatae custos fidelissimus’, and witnessed by ‘Stellatus,\r\nrectoriae coronatae capellanus’, and ‘Renatus, equitis coronatae servus\r\nobseruantissimus’.\r\n\r\n(x) ‘The Page bringeth tydings of his Maister’s Recouerie & presenteth\r\n    his Legacie.’\r\n\r\nA further address to the Queen, with a legacy in verse of the whole\r\nMannor of Loue, signed by Loricus and witnessed by Stellatus and\r\nRenatus.\r\n\r\nThis exhausts the _Ferrers MS._, but I can add from the _Petyt\r\nMS._ f. 300^v--\r\n\r\n(xi) ‘The melancholie Knights complaint in the wood.’\r\n\r\nThis, like (vii), is ascribed in the MS. to ‘Doctor Edes’. It consists\r\nof 35 lines in 6 stanzas of 6 lines each (with one line missing) and\r\nbegins:\r\n\r\n    What troupes are theis, which ill aduised, presse\r\n    Into this more than most vnhappie place.\r\n\r\nAllusions to the freeing of enchanted knights and ladies and to\r\nconstancy and inconstancy connect it closely with (vi)-(viii).\r\n\r\nObviously most of these documents, and therefore probably all, belong\r\nto devices presented by Sir Henry Lee. But they are of different dates,\r\nand not demonstrably in chronological order. A single occasion accounts\r\nfor (vi)-(viii) and (xi), and a single occasion, which the mention of\r\n‘the second daie’ suggests may have been the same, for (ix) and (x);\r\nand probably Mr. Bond is justified in regarding all these as forming\r\npart with (vii) of the entertainment at Lee’s house in the progress of\r\n1592. But I do not see his justification for attaching (iv) and (v) to\r\nthem, and I think that these are probably fragments of the Woodstock\r\nEntertainment of 1575, or not far removed from that in time. Nor has\r\nhe any evidence for locating the entertainment of 1592 at Quarrendon,\r\nwhich was only one of several houses belonging to Sir Henry Lee, and\r\ncould not be meant by the ‘coppies’ near Woodstock of (ix). It was\r\ndoubtless, as the Petyt MS. version of (vii) tells us, at Woodstock,\r\neither at one of Lee’s lodges, or at Ditchley, during the royal visit\r\nto Woodstock of 18–23 Sept. 1592. I learn from Viscount Dillon that\r\na MS. of part of this entertainment, dated 20 Sept., is still at\r\nDitchley. Finally, Bond’s attribution of all the pieces (i)-(x) to Lyly\r\nis merely guesswork. Hamper assigned them to George Ferrers, probably\r\nbecause the owner of his MS. was a Ferrers. George Ferrers did in fact\r\nhelp in the Kenilworth Entertainment of 1575, and might therefore\r\nhave helped in that at Woodstock; but he died in 1579, too early for\r\n(vi)-(xi). No doubt (vii) and (xi) are by Richard Edes (q.v.). He may\r\nhave written the whole of this Woodstock Entertainment. On the other\r\nhand, a phrase in (ix) suggests that Lee may have penned some of his\r\nown conceits. Brotanek, 62, suggests that the two ladies of (vi) are\r\nLee’s wife and his mistress Anne Vavasour, and that Elizabeth came\r\nto Lee’s irregular household to set it in order. This hardly needs\r\nrefuting, but in fact Lee’s wife died in 1590 and his connexion with\r\nAnne Vavasour was probably of later date.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT LEE.\r\n\r\nFor his career as an actor, see ch. xv.\r\n\r\nHe may have been, but was not necessarily, the author of _The Miller_\r\nwhich the Admiral’s bought from him for £1 on 22 Feb. 1598 (Greg,\r\n_Henslowe_, ii. 191).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS LEGGE (1535–1607).\r\n\r\nOf Norwich origin, Legge entered Corpus Christi, Cambridge, in 1552,\r\nand took his B.A. in 1557, his M.A. in 1560, and his LL.D. in 1575.\r\nAfter migration to Trinity and Jesus, he had become Master of Caius\r\nin 1573. In 1593 he was Vice-Chancellor, and in that capacity took\r\npart in the negotiations of the University with the Privy Council for\r\na restraint of common plays in Cambridge (_M. S. C._ i. 200). His\r\nown reputation as a dramatist is acknowledged by Meres, who in 1598\r\nplaced him among ‘our best for Tragedie’, and added that, ‘as M. Anneus\r\nLucanus writ two excellent Tragedies, one called _Medea_, the other\r\n_de Incendio Troiae cum Priami calamitate_: so Doctor _Leg_ hath penned\r\ntwo famous tragedies, y^e one of _Richard the 3_, the other of _The\r\ndestruction of Ierusalem_’.\r\n\r\n                    _Richardus Tertius.

Churchill, _Richard III bis\r\nShakespeare_ (1897, 1900).\r\n\r\nThe names in the actor-lists, which agree, confirm those MSS. which\r\ndate a production in March 1580 (Boas, 394), and as Essex left\r\nCambridge in 1581, the date in the _Tanner MS._, in so far as it\r\nrelates to a performance before him, is probably an error. It does not\r\nseem so clear to me that the _Caius MS._ may not point to an earlier\r\nproduction in 1573. And it is quite possible that there may have been\r\nrevivals in some or all of the later years named in the MSS. The\r\nreputation of the play is indicated, not only by the notice of it by\r\nMeres (_vide supra_), but also by allusions in Harington’s _Apologie\r\nof Poetrie_ (1591); cf. App. C, No. xlv. and Nashe’s _Have With You\r\nto Saffron Walden_ (1596, _Works_, iii. 13). It may even, directly or\r\nindirectly, have influenced _Richard III_. The argument to the first\r\n_Actio_ is headed ‘Chapman, Argumentum primae actionis’, but it seems\r\ndifficult to connect George Chapman with the play.\r\n\r\n                              _Lost Play_\r\n\r\n                    _The Destruction of Jerusalem_\r\n\r\nMeres calls this tragedy ‘famous’. Fuller, _Worthies_ (1662), ii. 156,\r\nsays that ‘Having at last refined it to the purity of the publique\r\nstandard, some Plageary filched it from him, just as it was to be\r\nacted’. Apparently it was in English and was printed, as it appears\r\nin the lists of Archer and Kirkman (Greg, _Masques_, lxii). It can\r\nhardly have been the _Jerusalem_ revived by Strange’s in 1592 (Greg,\r\n_Henslowe_, ii. 155). Can any light be thrown on Fuller’s story by the\r\nfact that in 1584 a ‘new Play of the Destruction of Jerusalem’ was\r\nadopted by the city of Coventry as a craft play in place of the old\r\nCorpus Christi cycle, and a sum of £13 6_s._ 8_d._ paid to John Smythe\r\nof St. John’s, Oxford, ‘for hys paynes for writing of the tragedye’\r\n(_Mediaeval Stage_, ii. 361; H. Craig, _Coventry Corpus Christi Plays_\r\n(_E. E. T. S._), 90, 92, 93, 102, 103, 109)?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS LODGE (_c._ 1557–1625).\r\n\r\nLodge, who uses the description ‘gentleman’, was son of Sir Thomas\r\nLodge, a Lord Mayor of London. His elder brother, William, married\r\nMary, daughter of Thomas Blagrave, Clerk of the Revels (cf. ch. iii).\r\nHe entered Merchant Taylors in 1571, Trinity College, Oxford, in 1573,\r\nwhence he took his B.A. in 1577, and Lincoln’s Inn in 1578. In 1579\r\n(cf. App. C, No. xxiii) he plunged into controversy with a defence\r\nof the stage in reply to Stephen Gosson’s _Schoole of Abuse_. Gosson\r\nspeaks slightingly of his opponent as ‘hunted by the heavy hand of\r\nGod, and become little better than a vagrant, looser than liberty,\r\nlighter than vanity itself’, and although Lodge took occasion to defend\r\nhis moral character from aspersion, it is upon record that he was\r\ncalled before the Privy Council ‘to aunswere certen maters to be by\r\nthem objected against him’, and was ordered on 27 June 1581 to give\r\ncontinued attendance (Dasent, xiii. 110). By 1583 he had married. His\r\nliterary work largely took the form of romances in the manner of Lyly\r\nand Greene. _Rosalynde: Euphues’ Golden Legacy_, published (S. R. 6\r\nOct. 1590) on his return from a voyage to Terceras and the Canaries\r\nwith Captain Clarke, is typical and was Shakespeare’s source for _As\r\nYou Like It_. His acknowledged connexion with the stage is slight; and\r\nthe attempt of Fleay, ii. 43, to assign to him a considerable share in\r\nthe anonymous play-writing of his time must be received with caution,\r\nalthough he was still controverting Gosson in 1583 (cf. App. C, No.\r\nxxxv), and too much importance need not be attached to his intention\r\nexpressed in _Scylla’s Metamorphosis_ (S. R. 22 Sept. 1589):\r\n\r\n    To write no more of that whence shame doth grow,\r\n    Or tie my pen to penny knaves’ delight,\r\n    But live with fame, and so for fame to write.\r\n\r\nHe is less likely than Nashe to be the ‘young Juvenal, that biting\r\nsatirist, that lastly with me together writ a Comedy’ of Greene’s\r\n_Groats-worth of Wit_ epistle in 1592 (cf. App. C, No. xlviii). I\r\nshould not cavil at the loose description of _A Looking Glass for\r\nLondon and England_ as a comedy; but ‘biting satirist’ hardly suits\r\nLodge; and at the time of Greene’s last illness he was out of England\r\non an expedition led by Thomas Cavendish to South America and the\r\nPacific, which started on 26 Aug. 1591 and returned on 11 June 1593.\r\nAfter his return Lodge essayed lyric in _Phillis_ (1593) and satire\r\nin _A Fig for Momus_ (1595); but he cannot be shown to have resumed\r\nwriting for the stage, although the Dulwich records make it clear\r\nthat he had relations with Henslowe, who had in Jan. 1598 to satisfy\r\nthe claims which Richard Topping, a tailor, had made against him\r\nbefore three successive Lord Chamberlains, as Lodge’s security for a\r\nlong-standing debt (Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, 44, 172). Lodge himself\r\nwas then once more beyond the seas. One of the documents was printed by\r\nCollier, _Memoirs of Alleyn_, 45, with forged interpolations intended\r\nto represent Lodge as an actor, for which there is no other evidence.\r\nSubsequently Lodge took a medical degree at Avignon, was incorporated\r\nat Oxford in 1602, and obtained some reputation as a physician. He also\r\nbecame a Catholic, and had again to leave the country for recusancy,\r\nbut was allowed to return in Jan. 1610 (cf. F. P. Wilson in _M. L. R._\r\nix. 99). About 1619 he was engaged in legal proceedings with Alleyn,\r\nand for a time practised in the Low Countries, returning to London\r\nbefore his death in 1625. Small, 50, refutes the attempts of Fleay,\r\ni. 363, and Penniman, _War_, 55, 85, to identify him with Fungoso in\r\n_E. M. O._ and Asotus in _Cynthia’s Revels_. Fleay, ii. 158, 352, adds\r\nChurms and Philomusus in the anonymous _Wily Beguiled_ and _Return from\r\nParnassus_.\r\n\r\n                             _Collection_\r\n\r\n1878–82. E.

No performance of it is\r\nrecorded in Henslowe’s diary, which suggests a date well before 1592.\r\n\r\n           _A Looking Glass for London and England, c. 1590_\r\n\r\n                     _With_ Robert Greene (q.v.).\r\n\r\n                           _Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nLodge’s hand has been sought in _An Alarum for London_, _Contention\r\nof York and Lancaster_, _George a Greene_, _Leire_, _Mucedorus_,\r\n_Selimus_, _Sir Thomas More_, _Troublesome Reign of King John_, and\r\n_Warning for Fair Women_ (cf. ch. xxiv), and in Greene’s _James IV_ and\r\nShakespeare’s _Henry VI_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANE, LADY LUMLEY (_c._ 1537–77).\r\n\r\nJane, daughter of Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, married John,\r\nLord Lumley, _c._ 1549.\r\n\r\n                            _Iphigenia_ (?)\r\n\r\n[_MS._] _Brit.

It is likely to be\r\npre-Elizabethan, but I include it here, as it is not noticed in _The\r\nMediaeval Stage_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS LUPTON (?-?).\r\n\r\nSeveral miscellaneous works by Lupton appeared during 1572–84. He may\r\nbe the ‘Mr. Lupton’ whom the Corporation of Worcester paid during the\r\nprogress of 1575 (Nichols, i. 549) ‘for his paynes for and in devising\r\n[and] instructing the children in their speeches on the too Stages’.\r\n\r\n                     _All For Money. 1558 < > 77_\r\n\r\n_S. R._ 1577, Nov. 25. ‘An Enterlude intituled all for money.’ _Roger\r\nWard_ (Arber, ii. 321).\r\n\r\n1578. A Moral and Pitieful Comedie, Intituled, All for Money. Plainly\r\nrepresenting the manners of men, and fashion of the world noweadayes.\r\nCompiled by T. Lupton. _Roger Ward and Richard Mundee._\r\n\r\n_Editions_ by J. O. Halliwell (1851, _Literature of Sixteenth and\r\nSeventeenth Centuries_), E. Vogel (1904, _Jahrbuch_, xl. 129), J. S.\r\nFarmer (1910, _T. F. T._).\r\n\r\nA final prayer for the Queen who ‘hath begon godly’ suggests an\r\nearlier date than that of Lupton’s other recorded work. Fleay, ii. 56,\r\nwould identify the play with _The Devil and Dives_ named in the\r\nanonymous _Histriomastix_, but Dives only appears once, and not\r\nwith Satan.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN LYLY (1554?-1606).\r\n\r\nLyly was of a gentle Hampshire family, the grandson of William, high\r\nmaster of St. Paul’s grammar school, and son of Peter, a diocesan\r\nofficial at Canterbury, where he was probably born some seventeen\r\nyears before 8 Oct. 1571, when he matriculated from Magdalen College,\r\nOxford. He took his B.A. in 1573 and his M.A. in 1575, after a vain\r\nattempt in 1574 to secure a fellowship through the influence of\r\nBurghley. He went to London and dwelt in the Savoy. By 1578, when he\r\npublished _Euphues_, _The Anatomy of Wit_, he was apparently in the\r\nservice of Lord Delawarr, and by 1580 in that of Burghley’s son-in-law,\r\nEdward, Earl of Oxford. It is a pleasing conjecture that he may have\r\nbeen the author of ‘the two prose books played at the Belsavage,\r\nwhere you shall find never a word without wit, never a line without\r\npith, never a letter placed in vain’, thus praised in _The Schoole of\r\nAbuse_ (1579) of his fellow euphuist, Stephen Gosson. He incurred the\r\nenmity of Gabriel Harvey by suggesting to Oxford that he was aimed at\r\nin the _Speculum Tuscanismi_ of Harvey’s _Three Letters_ (1580). In\r\n1582 he had himself incurred Oxford’s displeasure, but the trouble\r\nwas surmounted, and about 1584 he held leases in the Blackfriars (cf.\r\nch. xvii), one at least of which he obtained through Oxford, for the\r\npurposes of a theatrical speculation, in the course of which he took to\r\nCourt a company which bore Oxford’s name, but was probably made up of\r\nboys from the Chapel and St. Paul’s choirs. Presumably the speculation\r\nfailed, for in June 1584 Lyly, who on 22 Nov. 1583 had married Beatrice\r\nBrowne of Mexborough, Yorks., was in prison for debt, whence he was\r\nprobably relieved by a gift from Oxford, in reward for his service,\r\nof a rent-charge which he sold for £250. His connexion with the stage\r\nwas not, however, over, for he continued to write for the Paul’s\r\nboys until they stopped playing about 1591. Harvey calls Lyly the\r\n‘Vicemaster of Paules and the Foolemaster of the Theatre’. From this\r\nit has been inferred that he held an ushership at the Paul’s choir\r\nschool. But ‘vice’ is a common synonym for ‘fool’ and ‘vicemaster’,\r\nlike ‘foolemaster’, probably only means ‘playwright’. Nothing written\r\nby Lyly for the Theater in particular or for any adult stage is known\r\nto exist, but he seems to have taken part with Nashe in the retorts of\r\northodoxy during 1589 and 1590 to the Martin Marprelate pamphleteers,\r\nprobably writing the tract called _Pappe with a Hatchett_ (1589), and\r\nhe may have been responsible for some of the plays which certainly\r\nformed an element in that retort. Lyly’s ambitions were in the\r\ndirection of courtly rather than of academic preferment. He seems to\r\nhave had some promise of favour from Elizabeth about 1585 and to have\r\nbeen more definitely ‘entertained her servant’ as Esquire of the Body,\r\nprobably ‘extraordinary’, in or about 1588, with a hint to ‘aim his\r\ncourses at the Revels’, doubtless at the reversion of the Mastership,\r\nthen held by Edmund Tilney. Mr. R. W. Bond bases many conjectures about\r\nLyly’s career on a theory that he actually held the post of Clerk\r\nComptroller in the Revels Office, but the known history of the post\r\n(cf. ch. iii) makes this impossible. From 1596 he is found living in\r\nthe parish of St. Bartholomew the Less. He seems to have ceased writing\r\nplays for some while in 1590, and may be the ‘pleasant Willy’ spoken\r\nof as ‘dead of late’ and sitting ‘in idle Cell’ in Spenser’s _Tears\r\nof the Muses_ (1591), although it is possible that Tarlton (q.v.) is\r\nintended. But _The Woman in the Moon_ at least is of later date, and it\r\nis possible that both the Chapel and the Paul’s boys were again acting\r\nhis old plays by the end of the century. In 1595 he was lamenting the\r\noverthrow of his fortunes, and by about 1597 the reversion of the\r\nMastership of the Revels had been definitely promised to George Buck.\r\nThere exist several letters written by Lyly to the Queen and to Sir\r\nRobert Cecil between 1597 and 1601, in which he complains bitterly of\r\nthe wrong done him. Later letters of 1603 and 1605 suggest that at\r\nlast he had obtained his reward, possibly something out of the Essex\r\nforfeitures for which he was asking in 1601. In any case, he did not\r\nlive to enjoy it long, as the register of St. Bartholomew’s the Less\r\nrecords his burial on 30 Nov. 1606.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n_S.

I do not think\r\nthe reversion to ‘twelfe day’ in 1591, when the facts may have been\r\nforgotten, carries much weight. If so, the Court production was on a\r\n1 Jan., and although the wording of the t.p. suggests, rather than\r\nproves, that it was 1 Jan. in the year of publication, this date fits\r\nin with the known facts of Lyly’s connexion with the Blackfriars\r\n(cf. ch. xvii). The _Chamber Accounts_ (App. B) give the performers\r\non this day as Lord Oxford’s servants, but I take this company to\r\nhave been a combination of Chapel and Paul’s children (cf. chh. xii,\r\nxiii). Fleay, ii. 39, and Bond, ii. 310, with imperfect lists of Court\r\nperformances before them, suggest 31 Dec. 1581, taking ‘newyeares day\r\nat night’, rather lamely, for New Year’s Eve. So does Feuillerat, 574,\r\nbut I am not sure that his view will have survived his Blackfriars\r\ninvestigations. In any case, the play must have been written later than\r\nJan. 1580, as Lyly uses Sir T. North’s English translation of Plutarch,\r\nof which the preface is dated in that month. In a prefatory note by N.\r\nW. to S. Daniel, _The Worthy Tract of Paulus Jovius_ (1585), that work\r\nis commended above ‘Tarlton’s toys or the silly enterlude of Diogenes’\r\n(Grosart, _Daniel_, iv. 8).\r\n\r\n                     _Sapho and Phao. 3 Mar. 1584_\r\n\r\n_S.

Fleay, ii. 40, Bond,\r\nii. 367, and Feuillerat, 573, prefer Shrove-Tuesday (27 Feb.) 1582.\r\n\r\n                        _Galathea. 1584 < > 88_\r\n\r\n_S.

App. B), and in III. iii.\r\n41 is an allusion to the approaching year _octogesimus octavus_, which\r\nwould of course begin on 25 March 1588. Fleay, ii. 40, and Feuillerat,\r\n575, accept this date. Bond, ii. 425, prefers 1586 or 1587, regardless\r\nof the fact that the New Year plays in these years were by the Queen’s\r\nmen. A phrase in V. iii. 86 proves it later than _Sapho and Phao_. But\r\nif, as seems probable, the 1585 entry in the Stationers’ Register was\r\nof this play, the original production must have been at least as early\r\nas 1584–5, and that of 1588 a revival.\r\n\r\n                           _Endymion. 1588_\r\n\r\n_S.

A._ xxiv. 1), _L.’s E., an Addendum_ (1911, _M. P._ viii. 599).\r\n\r\nThe prologue and epilogue were evidently for the Court. The epistle\r\ndescribes this as the first of certain comedies which had come into\r\nthe printer’s hands ‘since the plays in Pauls were dissolved’. Baker,\r\nlxxxiii, suggested a date of composition in the autumn of 1579, while\r\nSpingarn, Bond, iii. 11, and Feuillerat, 577, take the Candlemas of the\r\nt.p. to be that of 1586, but the only available Candlemas performance\r\nby the Paul’s boys is that of 1588 (cf. App. B). With Long I find no\r\nconviction in the attempts of Halpin, Baker, Bond, and Feuillerat to\r\ntrace Elizabeth’s politics and amours in the play. If Lyly had meant\r\nhalf of what they suggest, he would have ruined his career in her\r\nservice at the outset.\r\n\r\n                           _Midas. 1589–90_\r\n\r\n_S.

Feuillerat, 578, prefers 6 Jan. 1589,\r\nbecause Gabriel Harvey alludes to the play in his _Advertisement to\r\nPap-Hatchet_, dated 5 Nov. 1589. But there was no Court performance\r\non that day, and Harvey may have seen the play ‘in Paules’.\r\n\r\n                     _Mother Bombie. 1587 < > 90_\r\n\r\n_S.

Feuillerat, 578, thinks it\r\nlater in style than _Midas_.\r\n\r\n                  _Love’s Metamorphosis. 1589–90_ (?)\r\n\r\n_S.

Brie (_E. S._ xlii. 222) suggests that the play borrowed from\r\nGreene’s _Greenes Metamorphosis_ (S. R. 9 Dec. 1588). Probably the\r\nPaul’s boys produced it _c._ 1589–90, and the Chapel revived it in\r\n1600–1.\r\n\r\n                _The Woman in the Moon. 1590 < > 5_ (?)\r\n\r\n_S.

As it was presented before her Highnesse.\r\nBy Iohn Lyllie Maister of Arts. _William Jones._ [Prologue.]\r\n\r\nThe prologue says:\r\n\r\n    Remember all is but a poet’s dream,\r\n    The first he had in Phoebus holy bower,\r\n    But not the last, unless the first displease.\r\n\r\nThis has been taken as indicating that the play was Lyly’s first; but\r\nit need only mean that it was his first in verse. All the others are\r\nin prose. The blank verse is that of the nineties, rather than that\r\nof the early eighties. There is nothing to show who were the actors,\r\nbut it is not unlikely that, after the plays in Paul’s were dissolved,\r\nLyly tried his hand in a new manner for a new company. Feuillerat, 232,\r\n580, suggests that Elizabeth may have taken the satire of women amiss\r\nand that the ‘overthwartes’ of Lyly’s fortunes of which he complained\r\nin Jan. 1595 may have been the result. He puts the date, therefore, in\r\n1593–4.\r\n\r\n                            _Doubtful Work_\r\n\r\nLyly has been suggested as the author of _Maid’s Metamorphosis_ and\r\n_A Warning for Fair Women_ (cf. ch. xxiv) and of several anonymous\r\nentertainments and fragments of entertainments (ibid., and _supra_,\r\ns.vv. Cecil, Clifford, Lee).\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS MACHIN (_fl. c._ 1608).\r\n\r\nNothing is known of Machin’s personality. He is probably the L. M. who\r\ncontributed ‘eglogs’ to the _Mirrha_ (1607) of the King’s Revels actor\r\nWilliam Barksted (q.v.). A Richard Machin was an actor in Germany,\r\n1600–6. There is no traceable connexion between either Richard or Lewis\r\nand Henry Machyn the diarist.\r\n\r\nMachin collaborated with Gervase Markham in _The Dumb Knight_\r\n(q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe anonymous _Every Woman in Her Humour_ and _Fair Maid of the\r\nExchange_ have also been ascribed to him (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nGERVASE MARKHAM (_c._ 1568–1637).\r\n\r\nThere were two Gervase Markhams, as to both of whom full details are\r\ngiven in C. R. Markham, _Markham Memorials_ (1913). The dramatist was\r\nprobably the third son of Robert Markham of Cotham, Notts., a soldier\r\nand noted horseman, whose later life was devoted to an industrious\r\noutput of books, verses, romance, translations, and treatises on\r\nhorsemanship, farming, and sport. He was, said Jonson to Drummond in\r\n1619, ‘not of the number of the faithfull, i.e. Poets, and but a base\r\nfellow’ (Laing, 11). Fleay, ii. 58, suggested, on the basis of certain\r\nphrases in his _Tragedy of Sir Richard Grenville_ (1595), which has a\r\ndedication, amongst others, to the Earl of Southampton, that he might\r\nbe the ‘rival poet’ of Shakespeare’s _Sonnets_. The other Gervase\r\nMarkham was of Sedgebrook and later of Dunham, Notts., and is not known\r\nto have been a writer. C. W. Wallace thinks he has found a third in\r\nan ‘adventurer’ whose wagers with actors and others on the success\r\nof an intended walk to Berwick in 1618 led to a suit in the Court of\r\nRequests (_Jahrbuch_, xlvi. 345). But as he, like Markham of Cotham,\r\nhad served in Ireland, the two may conceivably be identical, although\r\nthe adventurer had a large family, and it is not known that Markham of\r\nCotham had any. Markham of Dunham, who had also served in Ireland, had\r\nbut two bastards. Conceivably Markham wrote for the Admiral’s in 1596–7\r\n(cf. vol. ii, p. 145). Beyond the period dealt with, he collaborated\r\nwith William Sampson in _Herod and Antipater_ (1622) acted by the\r\nRevels company at the Red Bull.\r\n\r\n                       _The Dumb Knight. 1607–8_\r\n\r\n_S.

M. for William Sheares._\r\n\r\n_Editions_ in Dodsley^{1–4} (1744–1875) and by W. Scott (1810, _A. B.\r\nD._ ii).--_Dissertation_: J. Q. Adams, _Every Woman in Her Humour and\r\nThe Dumb Knight_ (1913, _M. P._ x. 413).\r\n\r\nThe Epistle says that ‘Rumour ... hath made strange constructions\r\non this Dumb Knight’, and that ‘having a partner in the wrong whose\r\nworth hath been often approved ... I now in his absence make this\r\napology, both for him and me’. Presumably these ‘constructions’ led to\r\nthe withdrawal of Markham’s name from the title-page. Fleay, ii. 58,\r\nassigned him the satirical comedy of the underplot, but Adams points\r\nout that Markham’s books reveal no humour, and that the badly linked\r\nunderplot was probably inserted by Machin. It borrows passages from the\r\nanonymous unprinted _Every Woman in Her Humour_ (q.v.). The production\r\nof a King’s Revels play is not likely to be before 1607, but Herz, 102,\r\nthinks that an earlier version underlies the _Vom König in Cypern_ of\r\nJacob Ayrer, who died 1605. A later German version also exists, and was\r\nperhaps the _Philole und Mariana_ played at Nuremberg in 1613.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER MARLOWE (1564–93).\r\n\r\nMarlowe, whose name was also spelt Marley and Marlin, was the son of\r\nJohn and Catherine Marlowe of Canterbury. He was born 6 Feb. 1564. John\r\nMarlowe was a shoemaker and subsequently became parish clerk of St.\r\nMary’s. He entered the King’s School, Canterbury, in 1579 and in March\r\n1581 matriculated with a pension on Abp. Parker’s foundation at Corpus\r\nChristi or Benet’s College, Cambridge. He took his B.A. in 1584 and\r\nhis M.A. in 1587. In this year he probably began his literary career\r\nin London, with _Tamburlaine_. A ballad, printed by Collier, which\r\nrepresents him as a player and breaking his leg in a lewd scene on the\r\nstage of the Curtain, is now discredited. There are satirical allusions\r\nto him in the preface to the _Perimedes_ (S. R. 29 March 1588) and in\r\nthe _Menaphon_ (23 Aug. 1589) of Robert Greene, but it is very doubtful\r\nwhether, as usually assumed, Nashe had him especially in mind when\r\nhe criticized certain tragic poets of the day in his epistle to the\r\nlatter pamphlet (cf. App. C, No. xlii). On 1 Oct. 1588 ‘Christofer\r\nMarley, of London, gentleman,’ had to give bail to appear at the\r\nnext Middlesex Sessions. The exact nature of the charge is unknown;\r\nbut it cannot be doubted that his personal reputation, even in the\r\nfree-living Elizabethan London, did not stand high. He is clearly\r\nthe ‘famous gracer of tragedians’ reproved for atheism in Greene’s\r\n_Groats-worth of Wit_ (1592) and it is probably to him that Chettle\r\nalludes in his apology when he says, ‘With neither of them that take\r\noffence was I acquainted and with one of them I care not if I never\r\nbe’ (cf. App. C, Nos. xlviii, xlix). The charge of atheism doubtless\r\narose from Marlowe’s association with the group of freethinkers which\r\ncentred round Sir Walter Raleigh. In 1593 these speculative tendencies\r\nbrought him into trouble. About 1591, while writing for the players of\r\na certain lord, as yet unidentified, he had shared a room with Thomas\r\nKyd (q.v.), who was then in the service of the same lord. Certain\r\ntheological notes of his got amongst Kyd’s papers and were found there\r\nwhen Kyd was arrested on a charge of libel on 12 May 1593. On 18 May\r\nthe Privy Council sent a messenger to the house of Thomas Walsingham,\r\nat Scadbury in Kent, to arrest Marlowe, and on 20 May he was ordered to\r\nremain in attendance on the Council. There exists a ‘Note’ drawn up at\r\nthis time by one Richard Baines or Bame, containing a report of some\r\nloose conversation of Marlowe’s which their Lordships could hardly be\r\nexpected to regard as anything but blasphemous. But, so far as Marlowe\r\nwas concerned, the proceedings were put a stop to by his sudden death.\r\nThe register of St. Nicholas, Deptford, records that he was ‘slain\r\nby Francis Archer’ and buried there on 1 June 1593. Francis Meres’s\r\n_Palladis Tamia_ (1598) tells us that he was ‘stabbed to death by a\r\nbawdy servingman, a rival of his in his lewde love’. Somewhat different\r\nversions of the story are given by Thomas Beard, _The Theater of God’s\r\nJudgments_ (1597), and William Vaughan, _The Golden Grove_ (1600), both\r\nof whom use Marlowe’s fate to point the moral against atheism. There\r\nare some rather incoherent allusions to the event in verses affixed\r\nby Gabriel Harvey to his _A New Letter of Notable Contents_, which is\r\ndated 16 Sept. 1593:\r\n\r\n                                 Sonet\r\n\r\n   Gorgon, or the Wonderfull yeare\r\n\r\n    ...

The ‘second\r\nShakerley’ is certainly Nashe. Surely ‘Scanderbeg’, who is ‘left\r\nbehinde’, must also be Nashe, and I do not see how Fleay, ii. 65, draws\r\nthe inference that Marlowe was the author of the lost play entered on\r\nthe Stationers’ Register by Edward Allde on 3 July 1601 as ‘the true\r\nhistorye of George Scanderbarge, as yt was lately playd by the right\r\nhonorable the Earle of Oxenford his servantes’ (Arber, iii. 187). There\r\nis much satire both of Marlowe and of Nashe in the body of _A New\r\nLetter_ (Grosart, _Harvey_, i. 255).\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1826. [G.

A._\r\nxxxiii. 436).\r\n\r\nThere is no real doubt as to Marlowe’s authorship of _Tamburlaine_,\r\nbut the direct evidence is very slight, consisting chiefly of Greene’s\r\n(q.v.) _Perimedes_ coupling of ‘that atheist Tamburlan’ with ‘spirits\r\nas bred of Merlin’s race’, and Harvey’s allusion to its author as dying\r\nin 1593. Thomas Heywood, in his prologue to _The Jew of Malta_, speaks\r\nof Alleyn’s performance in the play. The entry printed by Collier in\r\nHenslowe’s _Diary_ of a payment to Dekker in 1597 ‘for a prolog to\r\nMarloes tambelan’ is a forgery (Warner, 159; Greg, _Henslowe_, i.\r\nxxxix). The Admiral’s produced ‘Tamberlan’ on 30 Aug. 1594. Henslowe\r\nmarks the entry ‘j’, which has been taken as equivalent to ‘n. e.’,\r\nHenslowe’s symbol for a new play, and as pointing to a revision of\r\nthe play. I feel sure, however (cf. _M. L. R._ iv. 408), that ‘j’ only\r\nmeans ‘First Part’. ‘Tamberlen’ was given fifteen times from 30 Aug.\r\n1594 to 12 Nov. 1595, and the ‘2 pt. of tamberlen’ seven times from\r\n19 Dec. 1594 to 13 Nov. 1595 (Henslowe, ii. 167). Tamburlaine’s cage,\r\nbridle, coat, and breeches are included in the inventories of the\r\nAdmiral’s men in 1598 (_Henslowe Papers_, 116).\r\n\r\nGreene’s _Perimedes_ reference suggests 1587 or early 1588 as the\r\nprobable date of _Tamburlaine_. In his preface to the 1590 edition\r\nRichard Jones says that he has omitted ‘some fond and frivolous\r\ngestures’, but does not say whether these were by the author of the\r\ntragic stuff. The numerous references to the play in contemporary\r\nliterature often indicate its boisterous character; e.g. T. M. _The\r\nBlack Book_ (Bullen, _Middleton_, viii. 25), ‘The spindle-shank\r\nspiders ... went stalking over his head as if they had been conning of\r\nTamburlaine’; T. M. _Father Hubburd’s Tales_ (ibid. viii. 93), ‘The\r\nordnance playing like so many Tamburlaines’.\r\n\r\n                        _Dr. Faustus, c. 1588_\r\n\r\n_S. R._ 1592, Dec. 18.

Their 1598\r\ninventories include ‘j dragon in fostes’ (_Henslowe Papers_, 118).\r\nAlleyn (q.v.) played the title-rôle. The entry printed by Collier\r\nfrom Henslowe’s _Diary_ of a payment to Dekker on 20 Dec. 1597 ‘for\r\nadycyons to ffostus’ is a forgery (Warner, 159; Greg, _Henslowe_, i.\r\nxxxix), but Henslowe did pay £4 to William Bird and Samuel Rowley ‘for\r\nther adicyones in doctor fostes’ on 22 Nov. 1602 (Henslowe, i. 172).\r\nProbably, therefore, the Admiral’s revived the play about 1602–3. These\r\nadditions are doubtless the comic passages which appear for the first\r\ntime in the 1616 text, although that may also contain fragments of the\r\noriginal text omitted from the 1,485 lines of 1604. The source of the\r\nplay seems to be the German _Faustbuch_ (1587) through the English\r\n_History of Dr. Johann Faustus_, of which an edition earlier than the\r\nextant 1592 one is conjectured. A probable date is 1588–9. On 28 Feb.\r\n1589 ‘a ballad of the life and deathe of Doctor Faustus the great\r\nCungerer’ was entered on S. R. (Arber, ii. 516). There are apparent\r\nimitations of the play in _Taming of A Shrew_ (q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe reference in _The Black Book_ (_vide infra_) can hardly be taken as\r\nevidence that the original production was at the Theatre.\r\n\r\nGreg (_Henslowe_, ii. 168) gives some support to the view of Fleay\r\n(Ward, clxvii) that Marlowe is only responsible for part even of the\r\n1604 text, and that the rest, including the comic matter, may have been\r\ncontributed by Dekker. But he doubts whether Dekker worked upon the\r\nplay before the date of a revision in 1594, for which there is some\r\nevidence, such as an allusion in xi. 46 to Dr. Lopez. Fleay thought\r\nDekker to have been also an original collaborator, which his age hardly\r\npermits.\r\n\r\nThe play seems to have formed part of the English repertories in\r\nGermany in 1608 and 1626 (Herz, 66, 74).\r\n\r\nIt became the centre of a curious _mythos_, which was used to point\r\na moral against the stage (cf. ch. viii). Of this there are several\r\nversions:\r\n\r\n(_a_) 1604. T. M. _The Black Book_ (Bullen, _Middleton_, viii. 13),\r\n‘Hee had a head of hayre like one of my Diuells in Dr. Faustus when the\r\nold Theater crackt and frighted the audience.’\r\n\r\n(_b_) 1633. Prynne, _Histriomastix_, f. 556, ‘The visible apparition\r\nof the Devill on the stage at the Belsavage Play-house, in Queen\r\nElizabeths dayes (to the great amazement both of the actors and\r\nspectators) while they were there prophanely playing the History of\r\nFaustus (the truth of which I have heard from many now alive, who well\r\nremember it) there being some distracted with that feareful sight.’\r\n\r\n(_c_) N.D. ‘J. G. R.’ from manuscript note on ‘the last page of a book\r\nin my possession, printed by Vautrollier’ (1850, _2 Gent. Mag._ xxxiv.\r\n234), ‘Certaine Players at Exeter, acting upon the stage the tragical\r\nstorie of Dr. Faustus the Conjurer; as a certain nomber of Devels kept\r\neverie one his circle there, and as Faustus was busie in his magicall\r\ninvocations, on a sudden they were all dasht, every one harkning other\r\nin the eare, for they were all perswaded, there was one devell too\r\nmany amongst them; and so after a little pause desired the people to\r\npardon them, they could go no further with this matter; the people\r\nalso understanding the thing as it was, every man hastened to be first\r\nout of dores.

Strange’s men\r\ngave the play for Henslowe seventeen times from 26 Feb. 1592 to 1 Feb.\r\n1593. Probably it belonged to Henslowe, as it was also played for him\r\nby Sussex’s men on 4 Feb. 1594, by Sussex and the Queen’s together on\r\n3 and 8 April 1594, by the Admiral’s on 14 May 1594, by either the\r\nAdmiral’s or the Chamberlain’s on 6 and 15 June 1594, and thirteen\r\ntimes by the Admiral’s from 25 June 1594 to 23 June 1596 (Henslowe, ii.\r\n151). The 1598 inventories of the latter company include ‘j cauderm for\r\nthe Jewe’ (_Henslowe Papers_, 118). On 19 May 1601 Henslowe advanced\r\nthem money to buy ‘things’ for a revival of the play (Henslowe, i.\r\n137). Heywood’s epistle and Cockpit prologue name Marlowe and Alleyn\r\nas writer and actor of the play. Fleay, i. 298, suggests that Heywood\r\nwrote the Bellamira scenes (III. i; IV. iv, v; V. i), the motive of\r\nwhich he used for the plot of his _Captives_, and Greg agrees that the\r\nplay shows traces of two hands, one of which may be Heywood’s. The\r\nDresden repertory of 1626 included a ‘Tragödie von Barabas, Juden von\r\nMalta’, but this was not necessarily the play ‘von dem Juden’ given by\r\nEnglish actors at Passau in 1607 and Graz in 1608 (Herz, 66, 75).\r\n\r\n                     _Edward the Second. c. 1592_\r\n\r\n_S.

Greg (_Henslowe_,\r\nii. 224) suggests that it may have had some ‘distant connexion’ with\r\nChettle and Porter’s _The Spencers_ and an anonymous _Mortimer_ of the\r\nAdmiral’s men in 1599 and 1602 respectively. But I think _Mortimer_ is\r\na slip of Henslowe’s for _Vortigern_.\r\n\r\n                     _The Massacre at Paris. 1593_\r\n\r\n[_MS._] Collier, ii. 511, prints a fragment of a fuller text than that\r\nof the edition, but it is suspect (cf.

Possibly in Nov.\r\n1598 and certainly in Nov. 1601 Henslowe advanced sums for costumes\r\nfor a revival of the play by the Admiral’s. The insertion by Collier\r\nof Webster’s name in one of these entries is a forgery and whether\r\nthe lost _Guise_ of this writer (q.v.) bore any relation to Marlowe’s\r\nplay is wholly unknown. On 18 Jan. 1602 Henslowe paid Alleyn £2 for\r\nthe ‘boocke’ of ‘the massaker of france’ on behalf of the company\r\n(Henslowe, i. xlii; ii. 157).

Knutowski, _Das\r\nDido-Drama von M. und Nash_ (1905, _Breslau diss._).\r\n\r\nTanner, _Bibl. Britanniae_ (1748), says, ‘Petowius in praefatione ad\r\nsecundam partem Herois et Leandri multa in Marlovii commendationem\r\nadfert; hoc etiam facit Tho. Nash in _Carmine Elegiaco tragediae\r\nDidonis praefixo in obitum Christoph. Marlovii_, ubi quatuor eius\r\ntragediarum mentionem facit, necnon et alterius _de duce Guisio_’. The\r\nexistence of this elegy is confirmed by Warton, who saw it either in\r\n1734 or 1754 (_Hist. Eng. Poet._ iv. 311; cf. McKerrow, ii. 335). It\r\nwas ‘inserted immediately after the title-page’, presumably not of all\r\ncopies, as it is not in the three now known. Whether Nashe’s own share\r\nin the work was as collaborator, continuator, or merely editor, remains\r\nuncertain. Fleay, ii. 147, gives him only I. i. 122 to end, III. i, ii,\r\niv; IV. i, ii, v; Knutowski regards him as responsible for only a few\r\ntrifling passages. As, moreover, the play has affinities both to early\r\nand to late work by Marlowe, it cannot be dated. Beyond its title-page\r\nand that of the anonymous _Wars of Cyrus_ there is nothing to point\r\nto any performances by the Chapel between 1584 and 1600. It is true\r\nthat Tucker Brooke, 389, says, ‘The one ascertained fact concerning\r\nthe history of this company during the ten years previous to 1594\r\nseems to be that they acted before the Queen at Croydon in 1591, under\r\nthe direction of N. Giles, and Mr. Fleay assumes, apparently with no\r\nfurther evidence, that _Dido_ was presented on this ‘occasion’. But\r\nthis only shows what some literary historians mean by an ‘ascertained\r\nfact’. A company played _Summers Last Will and Testament_ (q.v.) at\r\nCroydon in 1592 and said that they had not played for a twelvemonth.\r\nBut the Queen was not present, and they are not known to have been\r\nthe Chapel, whose master was not then Nathaniel Giles. Nor did they\r\nnecessarily play twelve months before at Croydon; and if they did,\r\nthere is nothing to show that they played _Dido_. There is nothing to\r\nconnect the play with the Admiral’s _Dido and Aeneas_ of 1598 (Greg,\r\n_Henslowe_, ii. 189).\r\n\r\n                    _Lust’s Dominion. c. 1600_ (?)\r\n\r\n1657.

P._ i) and in Dodsley^4, xiv\r\n(1875).\r\n\r\nThe attribution of the play, as it stands, to Marlowe is generally\r\nrejected. Fleay, i. 272, supported by Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 211),\r\nsuggests an identification with _The Spanish Moor’s Tragedy_, which\r\nDay, Dekker, and Haughton were writing for the Admiral’s in Feb. 1600,\r\nalthough the recorded payment does not show that this was finished.\r\nThey think that a play in which Marlowe had a hand may perhaps underlie\r\nit, and attempt, not wholly in agreement with each other, to distribute\r\nthe existing scenes amongst the collaborators.\r\n\r\n                              _Lost Play_\r\n\r\n                        _The Maiden’s Holiday_\r\n\r\nEntered on the Stationers’ Register on 8 April 1654 (Eyre, i. 445)\r\nby Moseley as ‘A comedie called The Maidens Holiday by Christopher\r\nMarlow & John Day’, and included in Warburton’s list of burnt plays (_3\r\nLibrary_, ii. 231) as ‘The Mayden Holaday by Chri[~s].

He matriculated\r\nat Brasenose College, Oxford, aged 16, on 4 Feb. 1592, and took his\r\ndegree on 6 Feb. 1594. He joined the Middle Temple, and in 1599 his\r\nfather left law-books to him, ‘whom I hoped would have profited by\r\nthem in the study of the law but man proposeth and God disposeth’.\r\nHe had already begun his literary career, as a satirist with _The\r\nMetamorphosis of Pygmalion’s Image and Certain Satires_ (1598) and\r\n_The Scourge of Villainy_ (1598). For these he took the pseudonym\r\nof W. Kinsayder. Small, 64, has refuted the attempts to find in them\r\nattacks on Jonson, and H. C. Hart (_9 N. Q._ xi. 282, 342) has made\r\nit plausible that by ‘Torquatus’ was meant, not Jonson, but Gabriel\r\nHarvey. This view is now accepted by Penniman (_Poetaster_, xxiii). On\r\n28 Sept. 1599 Henslowe paid £2, on behalf of the Admiral’s, for ‘M^r\r\nMaxton the new poete’. The interlineated correction ‘M^r Mastone’ is\r\na forgery (Greg, _Henslowe_, i. xlii; ii. 206), but probably Marston\r\nwas the poet. The title of the play was left blank, and there was no\r\nfurther payment. It seems clearer to me than it does to Dr. Greg that\r\nthe £2 was meant to make up a complete sum of £6 10_s._ for _The King\r\nof Scots_, and that Marston was the ‘other Jentellman’ who collaborated\r\nwith Chettle, Dekker, and Jonson on that lost play. The setting up\r\nof the Paul’s boys in 1599 saved Marston from Henslowe. For them he\r\nsuccessively revised the anonymous _Histriomastix_ (q.v.), wrote the\r\ntwo parts of _Antonio and Mellida_ and _Jack Drum’s Entertainment_,\r\nhelped Dekker with _Satiromastix_, and finally wrote _What You Will_.\r\nThis probably accounts for all his dramatic work during Elizabeth’s\r\nreign. In the course of it he came into conflict with Jonson, who told\r\nDrummond in 1619 (according to the revision of the text of Laing,\r\n20, suggested by Penniman, _War_, 40, and Small, 3) that ‘He had\r\nmany quarrells with Marston, beat him, and took his pistol from him,\r\nwrote his Poetaster on him; the beginning of them were, that Marston\r\nrepresented him in the stage’. Marston’s representation of Jonson as\r\nChrysoganus in _Histriomastix_ was complimentary, that as Brabant\r\nsenior in _Jack Drum’s Entertainment_ offensive; and it was doubtless\r\nthe latter that stirred Jonson to retaliate on Marston, perhaps as\r\nHedon in _Cynthia’s Revels_, certainly as Crispinus in _The Poetaster_.\r\nMarston’s final blow was with Lampatho Doria in _What You Will_. When\r\nthe theatres reopened in 1604 Marston seems to have left the Paul’s\r\nboys and taken a share in the syndicate formed to exploit the Queen’s\r\nRevels, for whom the rest of his plays were written. He was now on\r\nfriendly terms with Jonson, to whom he dedicated his _Malcontent_ and\r\nfor whose _Sejanus_ he wrote congratulatory verses. Possibly further\r\nfriction arose over the unfortunate collaboration of Jonson, Marston,\r\nand Chapman in _Eastward Ho!_, for the chief indiscretion in which\r\nMarston seems to have been responsible, and may have stimulated a\r\nsarcasm on Jonson in the Epistle to _Sophonisba_. In 1608 Marston’s\r\ncareer as a dramatist abruptly terminated. An abstract of the Privy\r\nCouncil Register has the brief note on 8 June, ‘John Marston committed\r\nto Newgate’ (F. P. Wilson from _Addl. MS._ 11402, f. 141, in _M. L.\r\nR._ ix. 99). I conjecture that he was the author of the Blackfriars\r\nplay (cf. ch. xii, s.v. Chapel) which hit at James’s explorations\r\nafter Scottish silver. He disappeared, selling his interest in the\r\nBlackfriars company, then or in 1605, to Robert Keysar, and leaving\r\n_The Insatiate Countess_ unfinished. He had taken orders by 10 Oct.\r\n1616 when he obtained the living of Christchurch, Hampshire. This he\r\nresigned on 13 Sept. 1631. In 1633 he was distant from London, but died\r\non 25 June 1634 in Aldermanbury parish. He had married Mary, probably\r\nthe daughter of William Wilkes, one of James’s chaplains, of whom\r\nJonson said in 1619 (Laing, 16) that ‘Marston wrott his Father-in-lawes\r\npreachings, and his Father-in-law his Commedies’. If we trust the\r\nportrait of Crispinus in _The Poetaster_, he had red hair and little\r\nlegs. A letter from Marston to Sir Gervase Clifton, endorsed ‘Poet\r\nMarston’, is calendared in _Hist. MSS. Various Coll._ vii. 389; it is\r\nundated, but must, from the names used, be of 1603–8.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1633.

Greg (1921,\r\n_M. S. R._).\r\n\r\nIn V. i of Part i a painter brings in two pictures, one dated ‘Anno\r\nDomini, 1599’, the other ‘Aetatis suae 24’. I agree with Small, 92,\r\nthat these are probably real dates and that the second indicates\r\nMarston’s own age. As he must have completed his twenty-fourth year\r\nby 3 Feb. 1600 at latest, Part i was probably produced in 1599. The\r\nprologue of Part ii speaks of winter as replacing summer, and probably\r\ntherefore Part i is to be dated in the summer, and Part ii in the early\r\nwinter of 1599. Clearly the painter scene cannot, as Fleay, ii. 75,\r\nsuggests, be motived by a casual allusion to a painter in _Cynthia’s\r\nRevels_ (F_{1}) 2673 or the painter scene added on revision to Kyd’s\r\n_Spanish Tragedy_, since both are later. The ‘armed Epilogue’ of Part\r\ni seems to me clearly a criticism of the armed prologue of Jonson’s\r\n_Poetaster_ (1601); it may have been an addition of 1601. Part ii,\r\nprol. 13, 23, calls the theatre ‘round’ and ‘ring’.\r\n\r\n                         _What You Will. 1601_\r\n\r\n_S.

W._ (1905, _Jahrbuch_, xli.\r\n186).\r\n\r\nBullen, Fleay, ii. 76, Small, 101, and Aronstein agree in regarding\r\nthe play as written in 1601 by way of answer to _Cynthia’s Revels_,\r\nand they are probably right. Small shows that, in spite of the fact\r\nthat Quadratus calls Lampatho Doria a ‘Don Kynsader’ (II. i. 134),\r\nLampatho must stand for Jonson, and Quadratus to some extent for\r\nMarston himself. Perhaps Simplicius Faber is the unidentified Asinius\r\nBubo of _Satiromastix_. Both Fleay and Small think that the play has\r\nbeen revised before publication, partly because of confusion in the\r\nnames of the characters, and partly because of the absence of the kind\r\nof Marstonian language which Jonson satirized. Small goes so far as to\r\nsuggest that the seventeen untraceable words vomited by Crispinus in\r\n_The Poetaster_ came from _What You Will_, and that Marston rewrote\r\nthe play and eliminated them. The rest of Fleay’s conjectures about\r\nthe play seem to me irresponsible. If the play dates from 1601, it\r\nmay reasonably be assigned to the Paul’s boys. The induction, with\r\nits allusions to the small size of the stage and the use of candles,\r\nexcludes the possibility of an adult theatre.\r\n\r\n                     _The Dutch Courtesan. 1603–4_\r\n\r\n_S.

On the other hand, C. R. Baskervill (_M. L.\r\nA._ xxiv. 718) argues that the plot influenced that of _The Fair Maid\r\nof Bristow_, which was performed at Court during the winter of 1603–4.\r\nThe play is referred to with _Eastward Ho!_ (q.v.) as bringing trouble\r\non Marston by A. Nixon, _The Black Year_ (1606). It was revived for\r\nthe Court by the Lady Elizabeth’s on 25 Feb. 1613, under the name of\r\n_Cockle de Moye_ from one of the characters, and repeated on 12 Dec.\r\n1613 (cf.

Stoll, _John Webster_ (1905), 55, and _Shakspere, Marston, and the\r\nMalcontent Type_ (1906, _M. P._ iii. 281).\r\n\r\nThe induction, in which parts are taken by Sly, Sinklo, Burbadge,\r\nCondell, and Lowin, explains the genesis of the enlarged edition.\r\n\r\n   _Sly._ ... I would know how you came by this play?\r\n\r\n   _Condell._ Faith, sir, the book was lost; and because ’twas\r\n   pity so good a play should be lost, we found it and play it.\r\n\r\n   _Sly._ I wonder you would play it, another company having\r\n   interest in it.\r\n\r\n   _Condell._ Why not Malevole in folio with us, as Jeronimo\r\n   in decimosexto with them? They taught us a name for our play; we\r\n   call it _One for Another_.\r\n\r\n   _Sly._ What are your additions?\r\n\r\n   _Burbadge._ Sooth, not greatly needful; only as your salad\r\n   to your great feast, to entertain a little more time, and to\r\n   abridge the not-received custom of music in our theatre.\r\n\r\nStoll, 57, rightly argues that Small, 115, is not justified in ignoring\r\nthe evidence of the title-page and assigning the insertions, as well\r\nas the induction, to Webster rather than Marston. On the other hand,\r\nI think he himself ignores the evidence of Burbadge’s speech in the\r\ninduction, when he takes the undramatic quality of the insertions as\r\nproof that Marston did not write them first in 1604, but revived them\r\nfrom his original text, which the boy actors had shortened. He puts\r\nthis original text in 1600, because of the allusion in one of the\r\ninsertions (I. iii. 20) to a ‘horn growing in the woman’s forehead\r\ntwelve years since’. This horn was described in a pamphlet of 1588. I\r\ndo not share his view that ‘twelve’ must be a precise and not a round\r\nnumber. Sly says in the induction:\r\n\r\n   ‘This play hath beaten all your gallants out of the feathers:\r\n   Blackfriars hath almost spoiled Blackfriars for feathers.’\r\n\r\nIt is clear therefore that the original actors were the Blackfriars\r\nboys, and there is nothing else to suggest a connexion between Marston\r\nand these boys during Elizabeth’s reign. Small, 115, points out a\r\nreference to the Scots in V. iii. 24 which should be Jacobean. I\r\nthink that this is Marston’s first play for the Queen’s Revels after\r\nthe formation of the syndicate early in 1604, and that the revision\r\nfollowed later in the same year. It is not necessary to assume that the\r\nplay was literally ‘lost’ or that Marston was not privy to the adoption\r\nof it by the King’s. Importance is attached to the date by parallels to\r\ncertain plays of Shakespeare, where Stoll thinks that Shakespeare was\r\nthe borrower. I do not see how it can be so. The epilogue speaks of the\r\nauthor’s ‘reformed Muse’ and pays a compliment to ‘another’s happier\r\nMuse’ and forthcoming ‘Thalia’, perhaps Jonson’s _Volpone_.\r\n\r\n                        _The Fawn. 1604 < > 6_\r\n\r\n_S.

Dilke (1814, _O. E.

Small, 116, refutes Aronstein’s\r\nsuggested allusion to Jonson’s _Volpone_ of 1605 or 1606. Bolte,\r\n_Danziger Theater_, 177, prints from a seventeenth-century Dantzig MS.\r\na German play, _Tiberius von Ferrara und Annabella von Mömpelgart_,\r\nwhich is in part derived from _The Fawn_ (Herz, 99). If, as the titles\r\nsuggest, the performances of _Annabella, eines Hertzogen Tochter von\r\nFerrara_ at Nördlingen in 1604, of _Annabella, eines Markgraffen\r\nTochter von Montferrat_ at Rothenburg in 1604, and of _Herzog von\r\nFerrara_ at Dresden in 1626 (Herz, 65, 66), indicate intermediate\r\nlinks, _The Fawn_ cannot be later than 1604. Yet I find it impossible\r\nnot to attach some value to the argument of Stoll, _Webster_, 17, for\r\na date later than the execution of Sir Everard Digby on 30 Jan. 1606\r\n(Stowe, _Annales_, 881), which appears to be alluded to in IV. i. 310,\r\n‘Nay, heed me, a woman that will thrust in crowds,--a lady, that, being\r\nwith child, ventures the hope of her womb,--nay, gives two crowns\r\nfor a room to behold a goodly man three parts alive, quartered, his\r\nprivities hackled off, his belly lanched up’. It is true that there\r\nwere also quarterings for treason on 29 Nov. 1603 (Stowe, _Annales_,\r\ned. Howes, 831), but these were in Winchester; also that contemporary\r\nnotices, such as that in Stowe and the narratives in J. Morris,\r\n_Catholics under James I_, 216, and in _Somers Tracts_ (1809), ii.\r\n111, which describes the victims as ‘proper men, in shape’, afford no\r\nconfirmation of indecent crowds in 1606, but the cumulative effect\r\nof the quadruple allusions here, in Day’s _Isle of Gulls_ (q.v.),\r\nin Sharpham’s _Fleir_ (q.v.), and in Middleton’s _Michaelmas Term_\r\n(q.v.) is pretty strong. The passage quoted by Crawford, ii. 40, from\r\nMontaigne is hardly particular enough to explain that in the _Fawn_. I\r\ndo not like explaining discrepancies by the hypothesis of a revision,\r\nbut if Kirkham revived the _Fawn_ at Paul’s in 1606, he is not unlikely\r\nto have had it written up a bit. The epistle refers to ‘the factious\r\nmalice and studied detractions’ of fellow-dramatists, perhaps an echo\r\nof Marston’s relations with Jonson and Chapman over _Eastward Ho!_\r\n\r\n            _The Wonder of Women_, or _Sophonisba_. _1606_\r\n\r\n_S.

Some features of staging (cf. ch. xxi)\r\nraise a suspicion that the play may have been taken over from Paul’s.\r\nThe resemblance of the title to that of _Wonder of a Woman_ produced by\r\nthe Admiral’s in 1595 is probably accidental. The epistle glances at\r\nJonson’s translations in _Sejanus_ (1603).\r\n\r\n                   _The Insatiate Countess. c. 1610_\r\n\r\n1613. The Insatiate Countesse.

Two lines (V. ii. 244–5) appear verbatim in\r\nBarksted’s _Mirrha_ (1607). Small traces several other clear parallels\r\nwith both _Mirrha_ and _Hiren_, as well as stylistic qualities pointing\r\nto Barksted rather than to Marston, and concludes that the play is\r\nBarksted’s on a plot drafted by Marston. It may be conjectured that\r\nMarston left the fragment when he got into trouble for the second time\r\nin 1608, and that the revision was more probably for the Queen’s Revels\r\nat Whitefriars in 1609–11 than for the conjoint Queen’s Revels and\r\nLady Elizabeth’s in 1613. Hardly any of the suggestions on the play in\r\nFleay, ii. 80, bear analysis.\r\n\r\n                             _Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nOn _The King of Scots_, _vide supra_.

A traverse ‘slided away’, and disclosed the presenters\r\non clouds. Later a second traverse ‘sank down’, and the maskers\r\nappeared throned at the top of a wood. They danced ‘a new measure’,\r\nthen ‘presented their shields’, and took out the ladies for measures,\r\ngalliards, corantos and lavoltas. ‘The night being much spent’, came\r\ntheir ‘departing measure’.\r\n\r\nAt departure were an eclogue by a shepherd and a nymph, and a gift of a\r\ncabinet by Niobe in the little park.\r\n\r\n                     _Mountebank’s Mask. 1618_ (?)\r\n\r\nThe ascription to Marston of this Gray’s Inn mask rests on an\r\nunverifiable assertion by Collier (cf.

An earlier date has\r\nbeen thought to be indicated by _Eastward Ho!_ (1605), II. ii. 41,\r\n‘_Via_, the curtaine that shaddowed Borgia’, but if the reference is\r\nto a play, Borgia may well have figured in other plays. A play ‘Vom\r\nTurcken’ was taken by Spencer to Nuremberg in 1613 (Herz, 66).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES MASSEY.\r\n\r\nFor his career as an actor, cf. ch. xv.\r\n\r\nHe apparently wrote _Malcolm King of Scots_ for the Admiral’s, to\r\nwhich he belonged, in April 1602, and began _The Siege of Dunkirk,\r\nwith Alleyn the Pirate_ in March 1603. Neither play survives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP MASSINGER (1583–1640).\r\n\r\nMassinger, baptized at Salisbury on 24 Nov. 1583, was son of Arthur\r\nMassinger, a confidential servant of Henry, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. He\r\nentered at St. Alban Hall, Oxford, and left without a degree in 1606.\r\nLittle is known of him for some years thereafter. He is conjectured to\r\nhave become a Catholic and thus to have imperilled his relations with\r\nthe Herbert family, at any rate until the time of Philip, the 4th earl,\r\nwho was certainly his patron. He was buried at St. Saviour’s on 18\r\nMarch 1640 and left a widow. The greater part of his dramatic career,\r\nto which all his independent plays belong, falls outside the scope of\r\nthis notice, but on 4 July 1615 he gave a joint bond with Daborne for\r\n£3 to Henslowe, and some undated correspondence probably of 1613 shows\r\nthat he was collaborating in one or more plays with Daborne, Field, and\r\nFletcher.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\nT.

Cruickshank, _Philip Massinger_ (1920).\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful how far Massinger’s dramatic activity began before 1616.\r\nFor ascriptions to him, s.v. Beaumont and Fletcher (_Captain_, _Cupid’s\r\nRevenge_, _Coxcomb_, _Scornful Lady_, _Honest Man’s Fortune_, _Faithful\r\nFriends_, _Thierry and Theodoret_, _T. N. K._, _Love’s Cure_), Anthony\r\nBrewer (_The Lovesick King_), and _Second Maiden’s Tragedy_ (ch. xxiv).\r\nIt has also been suggested that a _Philenzo and Hypollita_ and an\r\n_Antonio and Vallia_, ascribed to him in late records, but not extant,\r\nmay represent revisions of early work by Dekker (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS MERBURY (_c._ 1579).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the epilogue to the following play is written ‘Amen,\r\nquoth fra: Merbury’. The formula may denote only a scribe, but a\r\nprecisely similar one denotes the author in the case of Preston’s\r\n_Cambyses_ (q.v.).\r\n\r\n             _A Marriage between Wit and Wisdom. c. 1579_\r\n\r\n[_MS._] _Brit. Mus. Addl. MS._ 26782, formerly _penes_ Sir Edward\r\nDering.\r\n\r\n_Editions_ by J. O. Halliwell (1846, _Sh. Soc._), J. S. Farmer (1909,\r\n_T. F. T._).\r\n\r\nThe MS. has a title-page, with the date 1579, an arrangement of the\r\nparts for six actors and the title ‘The ---- of a Marige betweene wit\r\nand wisdome very frutefull and mixed full of pleasant mirth as well\r\nfor The beholders as the Readers or hearers neuer before imprinted’.\r\nThere are nine Scenes in two Acts, with a Prologue and Epilogus. The\r\ncharacters are almost wholly allegorical. Idleness is ‘the vice’. The\r\nstage-directions mention a ‘stage’. Halliwell prints the mutilated\r\nword left blank in the title above as ‘Contract’, no doubt rightly.\r\nConceivably the play was in fact printed in 1579, as ‘Mariage of wit\r\nand wisdome’ is in Rogers and Ley’s play-list of 1656 (Greg, _Masques_,\r\nlxxxvii).\r\n\r\nThe play might be identical with the lost Paul’s moral of _The Marriage\r\nof Mind and Measure_ (cf. App. B), which also belongs to 1579. Fleay,\r\nii. 287, 294, infers from a not very conclusive reference to a ‘King’\r\nin sc. iv that it dates from the time of Edward VI. He also identifies\r\nit with the _Hit Nail o’ th’ Head_ named in _Sir Thomas More_ (q.v.)\r\nbecause that phrase is quoted in the Epilogus, curiously disregarding\r\nthe fact that the _Sir Thomas More_ list names the play under its\r\nexisting title as distinct from _Hit Nail o’ th’ Head_. Most of the\r\nplays in the _Sir Thomas More_ list seem to be pre-Elizabethan; cf.\r\n_Mediaeval Stage_, ii. 200.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MIDDLETON (_c._ 1570–1627).\r\n\r\nThomas Middleton was a Londoner and of a gentle family. The date of\r\nhis birth can only be roughly conjectured from the probability that\r\nhe was one of two Thomas Middletons who entered Gray’s Inn in 1593\r\nand 1596, and of his earlier education nothing is known. His first\r\nwork was _The Wisdom of Solomon Paraphrased_ (1597), and he may be\r\nthe T. M. of _The Black Book_ (1604) and other pamphlets in prose and\r\nverse. He appears as a dramatist, possibly as early as 1599 in _The\r\nOld Law_ and certainly in Henslowe’s diary during 1602, writing an\r\nunnamed play for Worcester’s men, and for the Admiral’s _Caesar’s Fall\r\nor The Two Shapes_ with Dekker (q.v), Drayton, Munday, and Webster,\r\nand by himself, _Randal Earl of Chester_, and a prologue and epilogue\r\nto Greene’s _Friar Bacon_ (q.v.). This work is all lost, but by 1604\r\nhe had also collaborated with Dekker for the Admiral’s in the extant\r\n_Honest Whore_. From 1602, if not from 1599, to the end of their career\r\nin 1606 or 1607, he was also writing diligently for the Paul’s boys. I\r\nthink he is referred to with their other ‘apes and guls’, Marston and\r\nDekker, in Marston’s _Jack Drum’s Entertainment_ (1600), IV. 40:\r\n\r\n    How like you _Musus_ fashion in his carriage?\r\n    O filthilie, he is as blunt as _Paules_.\r\n\r\nBrabant, the speaker, represents Jonson, who told Drummond in 1619\r\nthat he was ‘not of the number of the Faithfull, i. e. _Poets_, and but\r\na base fellow’ (Laing, 12). Occasional plays for several companies and\r\nthe beginnings of employment in city pageantry occupied 1607–16, and\r\nto later periods belong a fruitful partnership with William Rowley for\r\nPrince Charles’s men, and some slight share in the heterogeneous mass\r\nof work that passes under the names of Beaumont and Fletcher. He also\r\nwrote a few independent plays, of which _A Game at Chess_ (1624) got\r\nhim into political trouble. At some time before 1623 a few lines of his\r\ngot interpolated into the text of _Macbeth_ (cf. _Warwick_ edition, p.\r\n164). In 1620 he obtained a post as Chronologer to the City. He married\r\nMaria Morbeck, had a son Edward, and dwelt at Newington Butts, where he\r\nwas buried on 4 July 1627.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1840. A Dyce, _Works of T.

Of\r\nthe three authors only Middleton can then have been writing. Morris,\r\nafter elaborate study of the early work and the versification of all\r\nthree, concludes that Rowley (_c._ 1615) and Massinger (_c._ 1625)\r\nsuccessively revised an original by Middleton. The Paul’s plays began\r\nin 1599, but it cannot be assumed that this was one of them.

The Famelie of Love. Acted by the Children of his Maiesties\r\nReuells. _For John Helmes._ [Epistle to Reader, Prologue, Epilogue.]\r\n\r\nThe prologue apologizes that ‘expectation’ hath not ‘filled the general\r\nround’. The King’s Revels can hardly have existed before 1607. Fleay,\r\nii. 94, thinks that they inherited the play from Paul’s and assigns\r\nit to 1604 ‘when the Family of Love were such objects of public\r\nattention’. His chief reason is that the epistle regrets that the play\r\nwas ‘not published when the general voice of the people had sealed\r\nit for good, and the newness of it made it much more desired than at\r\nthis time’. It had ‘passed the censure of the stage with a general\r\napplause’. This epistle is clearly by the author, who says ‘it was\r\nin the press before I had notice of it, by which means some faults\r\nmay escape in the printing’. I agree that there must have been some\r\ninterval between production and publication. But there is no special\r\nvirtue in the date 1604. References to the Family of Love are to be\r\nfound in _Sir Giles Goosecap_ (_1601–3_), II. i. 263; _Dutch Courtesan_\r\n(_1603–4_), I. i. 156, I. ii. 18; _Mad World, My Masters_ (_1604–6_),\r\nI. ii. 73; _Isle of Gulls_ (_1606_), p. 26; _Every Woman in Her Humour_\r\n(?), p. 316. The sect was well known in England as early as 1574–81,\r\nwhen an act was passed for its suppression. It petitioned James _c._\r\n1604 and was answered in _A Supplication of the Family of Love_,\r\nprinted at Cambridge in 1606. On its history, cf. Fuller, _Church\r\nHistory_ (1868), iii. 239; F. Nippold, _Heinrich Niclaes und das Haus\r\nder Liebe_ (1862, _Z. f. Hist. Theol._); R. Barclay, _Inner Life of the\r\nReligious Societies of the Commonwealth_ (1876), 25; A. C.

Middleton. _For Henry Herringham._ [Epistle to Gentlemen.]\r\n\r\nThere is a mention (V. i. 112) of Fletcher’s _Wild-Goose Chase_\r\n(1621), and the introduction of a ‘rebel Oliver’ suggests a much later\r\ndate. But Bullen thinks this an old play revised, and Fleay, ii. 104,\r\nattempts to identify it with an anonymous play called both _Vortigern_\r\nand _Hengist_ (Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 181) which was produced by the\r\nAdmiral’s on 4 Dec. 1596 and bought by the same company from Alleyn in\r\n1601. There is not, however, much to support a theory that Middleton\r\nwas writing for the stage so early as 1596. Stork, 46, thinks that\r\nMiddleton and Rowley revised the older play _c._ 1606, ‘at a time when\r\nplays of ancient Britain were in vogue’.\r\n\r\n                           _Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nMiddleton’s hand has been sought in _Birth of Merlin_, _Puritan_,\r\nand _Second Maiden’s Tragedy_ (cf. ch. xxiv) and in _Wit at Several\r\nWeapons_ of the Beaumont (q.v.) and Fletcher series.\r\n\r\n                              _Lost Mask_\r\n\r\n                     _Mask of Cupid. 4 Jan. 1614_\r\n\r\nWriting to Carleton on 5 Jan. 1614 of the festivities at the Earl\r\nof Somerset’s wedding (Birch, i. 288; cf. s.v.

For\r\nhis successive masterships of Merchant Taylors and St. Paul’s, see ch.\r\nxii.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHONY MUNDAY (_c._ 1553–1633).\r\n\r\nAnthony was son of Christopher Munday, a London Draper. He ‘first was\r\na stage player’ (_A True Report of ... M. Campion_, 1582), but in\r\nOct. 1576 was apprenticed for eight years to John Allde, stationer.\r\nAllde went out of business about 1582, and Munday never completed his\r\napprenticeship, probably because his ready pen found better profit in\r\nthe purveyance of copy for the trade. He began by a journey to Rome\r\nin 1578–9, and brought back material for a series of attacks upon\r\nthe Jesuits, to one of which _A True Report of ... M. Campion_ is an\r\nanswer. According to the anonymous author, Munday on his return to\r\nEngland ‘did play extempore, those gentlemen and others whiche were\r\npresent, can best giue witnes of his dexterity, who being wery of his\r\nfolly, hissed him from his stage. Then being thereby discouraged, he\r\nset forth a balet against playes, but yet (o constant youth) he now\r\nbeginnes againe to ruffle upon the stage’. For the ballad there is some\r\ncorroborative evidence in a S. R. entry of 10 Nov. 1580 (cf. App. C,\r\nNo. xxvi), which, however, does not name Munday, and it is a possible\r\nconjecture that he also wrote the _Third Blast of Retrait from Plaies_\r\nissued in the same year (cf. App. C, No. xxvii). If so, he was already,\r\nbefore 1580, doing work as a playwright; but of this, with the doubtful\r\nexception of the anonymous _Two Italian Gentlemen_ (q.v.), there is no\r\nother evidence for another fifteen years. His experiences as an actor\r\nmay have been with the company of the Earl of Oxford, whose ‘servant’\r\nhe calls himself in his _View of Sundry Examples_ (1580). From 1581\r\nhe was employed by Topcliffe and others against recusants, and as a\r\nresult became, possibly by 1584 and certainly by 1588, a Messenger\r\nof the Chamber. He still held this post in 1593, and was employed\r\nas a pursuivant to execute the Archbishop of Canterbury’s warrants\r\nagainst Martin Marprelate in 1588. J. D. Wilson (_M. L. R._ iv. 489)\r\nsuggests that he may also have taken a hand in the literary and\r\ndramatic controversy, as ‘Mar-Martin, John a Cant: his hobbie-horse’,\r\nwho ‘was to his reproche, newly put out of the morris, take it how\r\nhe will; with a flat discharge for euer shaking his shins about a\r\nmaypole againe while he liued’ (_Protestation of Martin Marprelate_,\r\n_c._ Aug. 1589). Certainly Munday’s official duties did not interfere\r\nwith his literary productiveness, as translator of romances, maker of\r\nballads, lyrist, and miscellaneous writer generally. He is traceable,\r\nchiefly in Henslowe’s diary, as a busy dramatist for the Admiral’s men\r\nduring various periods between 1594 and 1602, and there is no reason\r\nto suppose that his activities were limited to these years. Meres in\r\n1598 includes him amongst ‘the best for comedy’, with the additional\r\ncompliment of ‘our best plotter’. But he was evidently a favourite mark\r\nfor the satire of more literary writers, who depreciated his style and\r\njested at his functions as a messenger. Small, 172, has disposed of\r\nattempts to identify him with the Deliro or the Puntarvolo of _E. M.\r\nO._, the Amorphus of _Cynthia’s Revels_, the In-and-In Medley of the\r\n_Tale of a Tub_, and the Timothy Tweedle of the anonymous _Jack Drum’s\r\nEntertainment_. But he may reasonably be taken for the Poet Nuntius\r\nof _E. M. I._ and the Antonio Balladino of _The Case is Altered_\r\n(q.v.); and long before Jonson took up the game, an earlier writer had\r\nintroduced him as the Posthaste of the anonymous _Histriomastix_ (c.\r\n1589). Posthaste suggests the formation of Sir Oliver Owlet’s men, and\r\nacts as their poet (i. 124). He writes a _Prodigal Child_ at 1_s._ a\r\nsheet (ii. 94). He will teach the actors to play ‘true Politicians’\r\n(i. 128) and ‘should be employd in matters of state’ (ii. 130). He\r\nis always ready to drink (i. 162; ii. 103, 115, 319; vi. 222), and\r\nclaims to be a gentleman, because ‘he hath a clean shirt on, with\r\nsome learning’ (ii. 214). He has written ballads (v. 91; vi. 235).\r\nThe players jeer at ‘your extempore’ (i. 127), and he offers to do a\r\nprologue extempore (ii. 121), and does extemporize on a theme (ii.\r\n293). He writes with\r\n\r\n              no new luxury or blandishment\r\n    But plenty of Old Englands mothers words (ii. 128).\r\n\r\nThe players call him, when he is late for rehearsal, a ‘peaking\r\npageanter’, and say ‘It is as dangerous to read his name at a play\r\ndoor, as a printed bill on a plague door’ (iv. 165). The whole portrait\r\nseems to be by the earlier author; Marston only adds a characteristic\r\nepithet in ‘goosequillian Posthast’ (iii. 187). But it agrees closely\r\nwith the later portraits by Jonson, and with the facts of Munday’s\r\ncareer. I do not think that ‘pageanter’ means anything more than\r\nplay-maker. But from 1605 onwards Munday was often employed by city\r\ncompanies to devise Lord Mayor’s pageants, and it has been supposed\r\nthat he had been similarly engaged since 1592 on the strength of a\r\nclaim in the 1618 edition of John Stowe’s _Survey of London_, which he\r\nedited, that he had been ‘six and twenty years in sundry employments\r\nfor the City’s service’. But there were other civic employments, and it\r\nis doubtful (cf. ch. iv) how far there were pageants during the last\r\ndecade of Elizabeth’s reign for Munday to devise. On the title-pages of\r\nhis pageants he describes himself as a ‘Cittizen and Draper of London’.\r\nThe Corporation’s welcome at the creation of Henry as Prince of Wales\r\nin 1610 (cf. ch. iv) also fell to him to devise. How long he continued\r\nto write plays is unknown. He had several children in St. Giles’s,\r\nCripplegate, between 1584 and 1589, and was buried on 10 Aug. 1633 at\r\nSt. Stephen’s, Coleman Street.\r\n\r\n_Dissertations_: J. D. Wilson, _A.

Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 172) agrees\r\nwith Fleay, ii. 114, that the play, of which the scene is at West\r\nChester, must be _The Wise Man of West Chester_, produced by the\r\nAdmiral’s on 3 Dec. 1594 and played to 18 July 1597. Their inventory\r\nof 1598 (_Henslowe Papers_, 117) includes ‘Kentes woden leage’. This\r\nis not required by the extant text, but two or three leaves of the\r\nMS. appear to be missing. If the identification is correct, it is not\r\neasy to see how the MS. can be earlier than 1594, although Sir E.\r\nM. Thompson’s warning that the date of 1596 may be a later addition\r\nis justified. On 19 Sept. 1601 the Admiral’s bought the book from\r\nAlleyn. Greg further suggests that _Randal Earl of Chester_, written by\r\nMiddleton for the same company in Oct. and Nov. 1602, may have been a\r\n‘refashioning’ of the earlier play, in which Randal is a character.\r\n\r\n           _The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntingdon. 1598_\r\n\r\n_S.

T._).--_Dissertation_: A.\r\nRuckdeschel, _Die Quellen des Dramas ‘The Downfall and Death of Robert,\r\nEarle of Huntington, otherwise called Robin Hood’_ (1897).\r\n\r\nHenslowe paid Munday £5 on behalf of the Admiral’s for ‘the firste\r\nparte of Robyne Hoode’ on 15 Feb. 1598. From 20 Feb. to 8 March he paid\r\nMunday and Chettle sums amounting to £5 in all for a ‘seconde parte’,\r\ncalled in the fullest entry ‘seconde parte of the downefall of earlle\r\nHuntyngton surnamed Roben Hoode’. The books and apparel and properties\r\nare in the Admiral’s inventories of March 1598 (_Henslowe Papers_, 114,\r\n115, 120, 121). Both parts were licensed for performance on 28 March.\r\nOn 18 Nov. he paid Chettle 10_s._ for ‘the mendynge of’ the first part,\r\nand on 25 Nov., apparently, another 10_s._ ‘for mendinge of Roben Hood\r\nfor the corte’. Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 190) suggests that the last\r\npayment was for the second part, and that the two Court performances by\r\nthe Admiral’s at Christmas 1598 are of these plays. However this may\r\nbe, Henslowe’s _1, 2 Robin Hood_ are doubtless the extant _Downfall_\r\nand _Death_. There is an allusion in _The Downfall_, IV. ii, to the\r\n‘merry jests’ of an earlier play, which may be _The Pastoral Comedy of\r\nRobin Hood and Little John_, entered in S. R. on 14 May 1594, but not\r\nnow known. Fleay, ii. 114, thinks that Chettle, besides revising some\r\nof Munday’s scenes, added the Induction and the Skeltonic rhymes.\r\n\r\n            _The Death of Robert Earl of Huntingdon. 1598_\r\n\r\n                            _With_ Chettle.\r\n\r\n_S.

Fleay, ii. 115, gives Munday\r\nthe scenes dealing with Robin Hood’s death and Chettle those dealing\r\nwith Maid Marian’s. The play contains discrepancies, but Henslowe’s\r\nentries afford no evidence that Munday revised Chettle’s work, as Fleay\r\nthinks. Greg (_Henslowe_, ii. 191) points out that Davenport borrowed\r\nmuch of his _King John and Matilda_ (1655) from _The Death_.\r\n\r\n                     _1 Sir John Oldcastle. 1599_\r\n\r\n              _With_ Drayton (q.v.), Hathway, and Wilson.\r\n\r\n                             _Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nThe following is a complete list of the plays in which Henslowe’s diary\r\nshows Munday to have written between 1597 and 1602. All were for the\r\nAdmiral’s:\r\n\r\n(i) _Mother Redcap._\r\n\r\nWith Drayton, Dec. 1597–Jan. 1598.\r\n\r\n(ii), (iii) _1, 2 Robin Hood._\r\n\r\n_Vide supra._\r\n\r\n(iv) _The Funeral of Richard Cœur-de-Lion._\r\n\r\nWith Chettle, Drayton, and Wilson, June 1598, probably as a sequel to\r\n_Robin Hood_ (cf. Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 190).\r\n\r\n(v) _Valentine and Orson._\r\n\r\nWith Hathway (q.v.), July 1598.\r\n\r\n(vi) A ‘comodey for the corte’, for the completion of which Drayton was\r\nsurety, Aug. 1598, but the entry is cancelled, and presumably the play\r\nwas not finished, unless it is identical with (vii).\r\n\r\n(vii) _Chance Medley._\r\n\r\nWith Chettle or Dekker, Drayton, and Wilson, Aug. 1598.\r\n\r\n(viii), (ix) _1, 2 Sir John Oldcastle._\r\n\r\nWith Drayton (q.v.), Hathway, and Wilson, Oct.–Dec. 1599.\r\n\r\n(x) _Owen Tudor._\r\n\r\nWith Drayton, Hathway, and Wilson, Jan. 1600, but apparently not\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n(xi) _1 Fair Constance of Rome._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker, Drayton, Hathway, and Wilson, June 1600.\r\n\r\n(xii) _1 Cardinal Wolsey._\r\n\r\nWith Chettle, Drayton, and Smith, Aug.–Nov. 1601.\r\n\r\n(xiii) _Jephthah._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker, May 1602.\r\n\r\n(xiv) _Caesar’s Fall, or The Two Shapes._\r\n\r\nWith Dekker, Drayton, Middleton, and Webster, May 1602.\r\n\r\n(xv) _The Set at Tennis._\r\n\r\nDec. 1602. The payment, though in full, was only £3; it was probably,\r\ntherefore, a short play, and conceivably identical with the ‘[sec]ond\r\npart of fortun[es Tenn?]is’ of which a ‘plot’ exists (cf. ch. xxiv)\r\nand intended to piece out to the length of a normal performance\r\nthe original _Fortune’s Tennis_ written by Dekker (q.v.) as a\r\n‘curtain-raiser’ for the Fortune on its opening in 1600. [This is\r\nhighly conjectural.]\r\n\r\nMunday must clearly have had a hand in _Sir Thomas More_, which is\r\nin his writing, and has been suggested as the author of _Fedele and\r\nFortunio_ and _The Weakest Goeth to the Wall_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n                            ENTERTAINMENTS\r\n\r\n          _The Triumphs of Reunited Britannia. 29 Oct. 1605_\r\n\r\nN.D.

He matriculated\r\nfrom St. John’s, Cambridge, on 13 Oct. 1582, took his B.A. in 1586,\r\nand left the University probably in 1588. According to the _Trimming_\r\n(Harvey, iii. 67), he ‘had a hand in a Show called Terminus & non\r\nterminus, for which his partener in it was expelled the Colledge: but\r\nthis foresaid Nashe played in it (as I suppose) the Varlet of Clubs;\r\nwhich he acted with such naturall affection, that all the spectators\r\ntooke him to be the verie same’. He went to London, and his first book,\r\n_The Anatomie of Absurditie_, was entered in S. R. on 19 Sept. 1588. In\r\nactual publication it was anticipated by an epistle ‘To the Gentlemen\r\nStudents of Both Universities’, which he prefixed to the _Menaphon_\r\n(1589) of Robert Greene (cf. App. C, No. xlii). This contains some\r\npungent criticism of actors, with incidental depreciation of certain\r\nilliterate dramatists, among whom is apparently included Kyd, coupled\r\nwith praise of Peele, and of other ‘sweete gentlemen’, who have\r\n‘tricked vp a company of taffata fooles with their feathers’. Evidently\r\nNashe had joined the London circle of University wits, and henceforth\r\nlived, partly by his pen, as dramatist and pamphleteer, and partly by\r\nservices rendered to various patrons, amongst whom were Lord Strange,\r\nSir George Carey, afterwards Lord Hunsdon, and Archbishop Whitgift.\r\nHis connexion with this last was either the cause or the result of his\r\nemployment, with other literary men, notably Lyly, in opposition to\r\nthe anti-episcopalian tracts of Martin Marprelate and his fellows. His\r\nprecise share in the controversy is uncertain. He has been credited\r\nwith _An Almond for a Parrot_, with a series of writings under the name\r\nof Pasquil, and with other contributions, but in all cases the careful\r\nanalysis of McKerrow, v. 49, finds the evidence quite inconclusive.\r\n\r\nMcKerrow, too, has given the best account (v. 65) of Nashe’s quarrel\r\nwith Gabriel and Richard Harvey. This arose out of his association\r\nas an anti-Martinist with Lyly, between whom and Gabriel there was\r\nan ancient feud. It was carried on, in a vein of scurrilous personal\r\nraillery on both sides, from 1590 until it was suppressed as a public\r\nscandal in 1599. One of the charges against Nashe was his friendship\r\nwith, and in the Harveian view aping of, Robert Greene, with whom,\r\naccording to Gabriel’s _Four Letters_ (_Works_, i. 170), Nashe took\r\npart in the fatal banquet of pickled herrings and Rhenish which\r\nbrought him to his end. Nashe repudiated the charge of imitation, and\r\nspoke of Greene in _Have With You to Saffron Walden_ (iii. 132), as\r\n‘subscribing to mee in anything but plotting Plaies, wherein he was\r\nhis crafts master’. Unless _Dido_ is early work, no play written by\r\nNashe before Greene’s death on 3 Sept. 1592 is known to us. But he is\r\npretty clearly the ‘young Iuuenall, that byting Satyrist, that lastly\r\nwith mee together writ a Comedie’ of Greene’s posthumous _Groats-worth_\r\n(cf. App. C, No. xlviii), and the tone of his own Defence of Plays in\r\n_Pierce Penilesse_ of 1592 (cf. App. C, No. xlvi) as compared with\r\nthat of the _Menaphon_ epistle suggests that he had made his peace\r\nwith the ‘taffata fooles’. His one extant unaided play belongs to\r\nthe autumn of 1592, and was apparently for a private performance at\r\nCroydon. Internal evidence enables us to date in Aug.–Oct. 1596, and\r\nto ascribe to Nashe, in spite of the fact that his name at the foot is\r\nin a nineteenth-century writing, a letter to William Cotton (McKerrow,\r\nv. 192, from _Cott. MS. Julius C._ iii, f. 280) which shows that he\r\nwas still writing for the stage and gives valuable evidence upon the\r\ntheatrical crisis of that year (App. D, No. cv). To 1597 belongs the\r\nmisadventure of _The Isle of Dogs_, which sent Nashe in flight to Great\r\nYarmouth, and probably ended his dramatic career. He is mentioned as\r\ndead in C. Fitzgeffrey, _Affaniae_ (1601).\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1883–5. A. B. Grosart, _The Complete Works of T. N._ 6 vols. (_Huth\r\nLibrary_).\r\n\r\n1904–10. R. B.

Fleay\r\n_Queen Elizabeth, Croydon and the Drama_ (1898).\r\n\r\nThe play was intended for performance on the ‘tyle-stones’ and in the\r\npresence of a ‘Lord’, to whom there are several other references, in\r\none of which he is ‘your Grace’ (ll. 17, 205, 208, 587, 795, 1897,\r\n1925). There are also local references to ‘betweene this and Stretham’\r\n(l. 202), to ‘Dubbers hill’ near Croydon (l. 621), to Croydon itself\r\n(ll. 1830, 1873), and to ‘forlorne’ Lambeth (l. 1879). The conclusion\r\nseems justified that ‘this lowe built house’ (l. 1884) was the palace\r\nof Archbishop Whitgift at Croydon.\r\n\r\nThere was a plague ‘in this latter end of summer’ (l. 80); which had\r\nbeen ‘brought in’ by the dog-days (l. 656), and had led to ‘want of\r\nterme’ and consequent ‘Cities harm’ in London (l. 1881). Summer\r\naccuses Sol of spiting Thames with a ‘naked channell’ (l. 545) and Sol\r\nlays it on the moon (l. 562):\r\n\r\n                                    in the yeare\r\n    Shee was eclipst, when that the Thames was bare.\r\n\r\nTwo passages refer to the Queen as on progress. Summer says (l. 125):\r\n\r\n    Haruest and age haue whit’ned my greene head:\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    This month haue I layne languishing a bed,\r\n    Looking eche hour to yeeld my life and throne;\r\n    And dyde I had in deed vnto the earth,\r\n    But that _Eliza_, Englands beauteous Queene,\r\n    On whom all seasons prosperously attend,\r\n    Forbad the execution of my fate,\r\n    Vntill her ioyfull progresse was expir’d.\r\n    For her doth Summer liue, and linger here.\r\n\r\nAnd again, at the end of the play (l. 1841):\r\n\r\n    Vnto _Eliza_, that most sacred Dame,\r\n    Whom none but Saints and Angels ought to name,\r\n    All my faire dayes remaining I bequeath,\r\n    To waite vpon her till she be returnd.\r\n    Autumne, I charge thee, when that I am dead,\r\n    Be prest and seruiceable at her beck,\r\n    Present her with thy goodliest ripened fruites.\r\n\r\nThe plague and absence of term from London might fit either 1592 or\r\n1593 (cf. App. E), but I agree with McKerrow, iv. 418, that the earlier\r\nyear is indicated. In 1593 the plague did not begin in the dog-days,\r\nnor did Elizabeth go on progress. And it is on 6 Sept. 1592 that\r\nStowe (1615), 764, records the emptying of Thames. I may add a small\r\nconfirmatory point. Are not ‘the horses lately sworne to be stolne’ (l.\r\n250) those stolen by Germans in the train of Count Mompelgard between\r\nReading and Windsor and referred to in _Merry Wives_, IV. v. 78. The\r\nCount came to Windsor on 19 Aug. 1592 (Rye, xcix). Now I part company\r\nwith Mr. McKerrow, who thinks that, although the play was written in\r\n1592, it may have been revised for performance before Elizabeth in\r\na later year, perhaps at her visit to Whitgift on 14 Aug. 1600. His\r\nreasons are three: (_a_) Sol’s reference to the Thames seems to date\r\nit in a year earlier than that in which he speaks; (_b_) the seasonal\r\nreferences suggest August, while Stowe’s date necessitates September at\r\nearliest, and the want of term points to October; (_c_) the references\r\nto Elizabeth imply her presence. I think there is something in (_a_),\r\nbut not much, if the distinction between actual and dramatic time is\r\nkept in mind. As to (_b_), the tone of the references is surely to a\r\nsummer prolonged beyond its natural expiration for Eliza’s benefit,\r\nwell into autumn, and in such a year the fruits of autumn, which in\r\nthis country are chiefly apples, will be on the trees until October.\r\nAs to (_c_), I cannot find any evidence of the Queen’s presence at\r\nall. Surely she is on progress elsewhere, and due to ‘return’ in the\r\nfuture. I may add that Elizabeth was at Croydon in the spring of 1593,\r\nand that it would, therefore, have been odd to defer a revival for her\r\nbenefit until another seven years had elapsed. The 1592 progress came\r\nto an end upon 9 Oct. and I should put the performance not long before.\r\nWhen Q_{1} of _Pierce Penilesse_ (S. R. 8 Aug. 1592) was issued, Nashe\r\nwas kept by fear of infection ‘with my Lord in the Countrey’, and the\r\nmisinterpretations of the pamphlet which he deprecates in the epistle\r\nto Q_{2} (McKerrow, i. 154) are hinted at in a very similar protest (l.\r\n65) in the play.\r\n\r\nThe prologue is spoken by ‘the greate foole _Toy_’ (ll. 10, 1945),\r\nwho would borrow a chain and fiddle from ‘my cousin Ned’ (l. 7), also\r\ncalled ‘Ned foole’ (l. 783). The epilogue is spoken (l. 1194) and\r\nthe songs sung (ll. 117, 1871) by boys. Will Summer (l. 792) gives\r\ngood advice to certain ‘deminitiue urchins’, who wait ‘on my Lords\r\ntrencher’; but he might be speaking either to actors or to boys in the\r\naudience. The morris (l. 201) dances ‘for the credit of Wostershire’,\r\nwhere Whitgift had been bishop. The prompter was Dick Huntley (l. 14),\r\nand Vertumnus was acted by Harry Baker (l. 1567). There is a good deal\r\nof Latin in the text. On the whole, I think that the play was given\r\nby members of Whitgift’s household, which his biographer describes\r\nas ‘a little academy’. The prologue (l. 33) has ‘So fares it with vs\r\nnouices, that here betray our imperfections: we, afraid to looke on\r\nthe imaginary serpent of Enuy, paynted in mens affections, haue ceased\r\nto tune any musike of mirth to your eares this twelue-month, thinking\r\nthat, as it is the nature of the serpent to hisse, so childhood and\r\nignorance would play the goslings, contemning and condemning what they\r\nvnderstood not’. This agrees curiously in date with the termination\r\nof the Paul’s plays. Whitgift might have entertained the Paul’s boys\r\nduring the plague and strengthened them for a performance with members\r\nof his own household. But would they call themselves ‘nouices’?\r\n\r\n                   _Dido, Queen of Carthage > 1593_\r\n\r\n                        _With_ Marlowe (q.v.).\r\n\r\n                             _Lost Plays_\r\n\r\n                _Terminus et non Terminus. 1586 < > 8_\r\n\r\n_Vide supra._ McKerrow, v. 10, thinks that the name of Nashe’s alleged\r\npart may be a jest, and points out that the identification by Fleay,\r\nii. 124, of the play, of which nothing more is known, with the ‘London\r\nComedie’ of the _Cards_ referred to in Harington’s _Apology_ (cf. App.\r\nC, No. xlv) is improbable.\r\n\r\n                       _The Isle of Dogs. 1597_\r\n\r\nMeres, _Palladis Tamia_ (S. R. 7 Sept. 1598), writes:\r\n\r\n   ‘As _Actaeon_ was wooried of his owne hounds: so is _Tom Nash_\r\n   of his _Isle of Dogs_. Dogges were the death of _Euripedes_,\r\n   but bee not disconsolate gallant young _Iuuenall_, _Linus_,\r\n   the sonne of _Apollo_ died the same death. Yet God forbid that\r\n   so braue a witte should so basely perish, thine are but paper\r\n   dogges, neither is thy banishment like _Ouids_, eternally to\r\n   conuerse with the barbarous _Getes_. Therefore comfort thy\r\n   selfe sweete _Tom_, with _Ciceros_ glorious return to Rome, &\r\n   with the counsel _Aeneas_ giues to his seabeaten soldiors.’\r\n\r\nWe learn something more from _Nashes Lenten Stuffe_ (S. R. 11 Jan.\r\n1599), where he tells us that he is sequestered from the wonted means\r\nof his maintenance and exposed to attacks on his fame, through ‘the\r\nstraunge turning of the Ile of Dogs from a commedie to a tragedie\r\ntwo summers past, with the troublesome stir which hapned aboute it’,\r\nand goes on to explain the ‘infortunate imperfit Embrion of my idle\r\nhoures, the Ile of Dogs before mentioned ... was no sooner borne but\r\nI was glad to run from it’; which is what brought him to Yarmouth. In\r\na marginal note he adds ‘An imperfit Embrion I may well call it, for\r\nI hauing begun but the induction and first act of it, the other foure\r\nacts without my consent, or the least guesse of my drift or scope, by\r\nthe players were supplied, which bred both their trouble and mine to’\r\n(McKerrow, iii. 153). Of this there is perhaps some confirmation in the\r\nlist of writings on the cover of the _Northumberland MS._ which records\r\nthe item, not now extant in the MS., ‘Ile of doges frmn^t by Thomas\r\nNashe inferior plaiers’. This MS. contains work by Bacon (q.v.), and\r\nif the entry is not itself based on _Lenten Stuffe_, it may indicate\r\nthat Bacon was professionally concerned in the proceedings to which\r\nthe play gave rise. McKerrow, v. 31, points out that the evidence is\r\nagainst the suggestion in the _Trimming of Thomas Nashe_ (S. R. 11\r\nOct. 1597) that Nashe suffered imprisonment for the play. The Privy\r\nCouncil letter of 15 Aug. 1597 (cf. App. D, No. cxi) was no doubt\r\nintended to direct his apprehension, but, as I pointed out in _M. L.\r\nR._ iv. 410, 511, the actor and maker of plays referred to therein\r\nas actually in prison must have been Ben Jonson, who was released by\r\nthe Council on 3 Oct. 1597 (cf. App. D, No. cxii). The connexion of\r\nJonson (q.v.) with the _Isle of Dogs_ is noted in _Satiromastix_. With\r\nhim the Council released Gabriel Spencer and Robert Shaw, and the\r\ninference is that the peccant company was Pembroke’s (q.v.) at the\r\nSwan on Bankside. The belief that it was the Admiral’s at the Rose\r\nonly rests on certain forged interpolations by Collier in Henslowe’s\r\ndiary. These are set out by Greg (_Henslowe_, i. xl). The only genuine\r\nmention of the affair in the diary is the provision noted in the\r\nmemorandum of Borne’s agreement of 10 Aug. 1597 that his service is to\r\nbegin ‘imediatly after this restraynt is recaled by the lordes of the\r\ncounsell which restraynt is by the meanes of playinge the Ieylle of\r\nDooges’ (_Henslowe_, i. 203). The restraint was ordered by the Privy\r\nCouncil on 28 July 1597 (App. D, No. cx), presumably soon after the\r\noffence, the nature of which is only vaguely described as the handling\r\nof ‘lewd matters’. Perhaps it is possible, at any rate in conjecture,\r\nto be more specific. By dogs we may take it that Nashe meant men. The\r\nidea was not new to him. In _Summer’s Last Will and Testament_ he makes\r\nOrion draw an elaborate parallel between dogs and men, at the end of\r\nwhich Will Summer says that he had not thought ‘the ship of fooles\r\nwould haue stayde to take in fresh water at the Ile of dogges’ (l.\r\n779). But there is nothing offensive to authority here. Nashe returns\r\nto the question of his indiscretion in more than one passage of _Lenten\r\nStuffe_, and in particular has a diatribe (McKerrow, iii. 213) against\r\nlawyers who try to fish ‘a deepe politique state meaning’ out of what\r\ncontains no such thing. ‘Talke I of a beare, O, it is such a man that\r\nemblazons him in his armes, or of a woolfe, a fox, or a camelion, any\r\nlording whom they do not affect it is meant by.’ Apparently Nashe was\r\naccused of satirizing some nobleman. But this was not the only point\r\nof attack. ‘Out steps me an infant squib of the Innes of Court ...\r\nand he, to approue hymselfe an extrauagant statesman, catcheth hold\r\nof a rush, and absolutely concludeth, it is meant of the Emperor of\r\nRuscia, and that it will vtterly marre the traffike into that country\r\nif all the Pamphlets bee not called in and suppressed, wherein that\r\nlibelling word is mentioned.’ I do not suppose that Nashe had literally\r\ncalled the Emperor of Russia a rush in _The Isle of Dogs_, but it is\r\nquite possible that he, or Ben Jonson, had called the King of Poland\r\na pole. On 23 July 1597, just five days before the trouble, a Polish\r\nambassador had made representations in an audience with Elizabeth,\r\napparently about the question, vexed in the sixteenth as in the\r\ntwentieth century, of contraband in neutral vessels, and she, scouring\r\nup her rusty old Latin for the purpose, had answered him in very\r\nround terms. The matter, to which there are several allusions in the\r\nCecilian correspondence (Wright, _Eliz._ ii. 478, 481, 485), gave some\r\ntrouble, and any mention of it on the public stage might well have been\r\nresented. A letter of Robert Beale in 1592 (McKerrow, v. 142) shows\r\nthat the criticisms of Nashe’s _Pierce Penilesse_ had similarly been\r\ndue to his attack upon the Danes, with which country the diplomatic\r\nissues were much the same as with Poland. In _Hatfield MSS._ vii. 343\r\nis a letter of 10 Aug. 1597 to Robert Cecil from Richard (misdescribed\r\nin the Calendar as Robert) Topcliffe, recommending an unnamed bearer\r\nas ‘the first man that discovered to me that seditious play called The\r\nIsle of Dogs’.\r\n\r\n                            _Doubtful Play_\r\n\r\nNashe has been suggested as a contributor to _A Knack to Know a Knave_\r\n(cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS NELSON.\r\n\r\nThe pageant-writer is probably identical with the stationer of the same\r\nname, who is traceable in London during 1580–92 (McKerrow, 198).\r\n\r\n                     _Allot Pageant. 29 Oct. 1590_\r\n\r\n1590.

Apparently he is distinct from the Thomas\r\nNorton who acted from 1560 as counsel to the Stationers’ Company. He\r\ntook part in theological controversy as a Calvinist, and was opposed\r\nto the public stage (cf. App. D, No. xxxi). In 1583 he escaped with\r\nsome difficulty from a charge of treason.

Machyn, 275, records on 18 Jan. 1561 ‘a play in\r\nthe quen hall at Westmynster by the gentyll-men of the Tempull, and\r\nafter a grett maske, for ther was a grett skaffold in the hall, with\r\ngrett tryhumpe as has bene sene; and the morow after the skaffold was\r\ntaken done’.

He might be the Patten described in\r\n_D. N. B._ as rector of Stoke Newington (but not traceable in Hennessy)\r\nand author of an anonymous _Calendars of Scripture_ (1575). But I\r\nthink he is more likely to have been Mercurius, son of William Patten,\r\nteller of the exchequer and lord of the manor of Stoke Newington,\r\nwho matriculated at Trinity, Cambridge, in 1567 and was Blue Mantle\r\npursuivant in 1603 (_Hist. of Stoke Newington_ in _Bibl. Top. Brit._\r\nii; _Admissions to T. C. C._ ii. 70).\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE PEELE (_c._ 1557–96).\r\n\r\nAs the son of James Peele, clerk of Christ’s Hospital and himself a\r\nmaker of pageants (vol. i, p. 136; _Mediaeval Stage_, ii. 166), George\r\nentered the grammar school in 1565, proceeded thence to Broadgates\r\nHall, Oxford, in 1571, and became a student of Christ Church in 1574,\r\ntaking his B.A. in 1577 and his M.A. in 1579. In Sept. 1579 the court\r\nof Christ’s Hospital required James Peele ‘to discharge His howse\r\nof his sonne George Peele and all other his howsold which have bene\r\nchargable to him’. This perhaps explains why George prolonged his\r\nresidence at Oxford until 1581. In that year he came to London, and\r\nabout the same time married. His wife’s business affairs brought him\r\nback to Oxford in 1583 and in a deposition of 29 March he describes\r\nhimself as aged 25. During this visit he superintended the performance\r\nbefore Alasco at Christ Church on 11 and 12 June of the _Rivales_ and\r\n_Dido_ of William Gager, who bears testimony to Peele’s reputation as\r\nwit and poet in two sets of Latin verses _In Iphigeniam Georgii Peeli\r\nAnglicanis versibus redditam_ (Boas, 166,180). Presumably the rest of\r\nhis life was spent in London, and its wit and accompanying riot find\r\nsome record in _The Merry Conceited Jests of George Peele_ (S. R. 14\r\nDec. 1605: text in Bullen and in Hazlitt, _Jest Books_, ii. 261, and\r\nHindley, i), although this is much contaminated with traditional matter\r\nfrom earlier jest books. It provided material for the anonymous play of\r\n_The Puritan_ (1607), in which Peele appeared as George Pyeboard. His\r\nfame as a dramatist is thus acknowledged in Nashe’s epistle to Greene’s\r\n_Menaphon_ (1589):\r\n\r\n   ‘For the last, though not the least of them all, I dare commend\r\n   him to all that know him, as the chief supporter of pleasance\r\n   now living, the Atlas of poetry, and _primus verborum artifex_;\r\n   whose first increase, the Arraignment of Paris, might plead to\r\n   your opinions his pregnant dexterity of wit and manifold variety\r\n   of invention, wherein (_me iudice_) he goeth a step beyond all\r\n   that write.’\r\n\r\nSome have thought that Peele is the\r\n\r\n            Palin, worthy of great praise,\r\n    Albe he envy at my rustic quill,\r\n\r\nof Spenser’s _Colin Clout’s Come Home Again_ (1591). It seems difficult\r\nto accept the suggestions of Sarrazin that he was the original both of\r\nFalstaff and of Yorick. An allusion in a letter to Edward Alleyn (cf.\r\nch. xv) has unjustifiably been interpreted as implying that Peele was\r\nactor as well as playwright, and Collier accordingly included his name\r\nin a forged list of housekeepers at an imaginary Blackfriars theatre\r\nof 1589 (cf. vol. ii, p. 108). He was, however, clearly one of the\r\nthree of his ‘quondam acquaintance’ to whom Greene (q.v.) addressed\r\nthe attack upon players in his _Groats-worth of Wit_ (1592). In 1596\r\nPeele after ‘long sickness’ sent a begging letter by his daughter to\r\nLord Burghley, with a copy of his _Tale of Troy_. He was buried as a\r\n‘householder’ at St. James’s, Clerkenwell, on 9 Nov. 1596 (_Harl. Soc.\r\nRegisters_, xvii. 58), having died, according to Meres’s _Palladis\r\nTamia_, ‘by the pox’. He can, therefore, hardly be the Peleus of _Birth\r\nof Hercules_ (1597 <).\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1828–39. A. Dyce. 3 vols.\r\n\r\n1861, 1879. A. Dyce. 1 vol.

Greg (1907, _M. S. R._).\r\n\r\nInterest in Sebastian was aroused in 1589 by the expedition of Norris\r\nand Drake to set Don Antonio on the throne of Portugal. This started on\r\n18 April, and Peele wrote _A Farewell_, in which is a reference to this\r\namongst other plays (l. 20, ed. Bullen, ii. 238):\r\n\r\n    Bid theatres and proud tragedians,\r\n    Bid Mahomet’s Poo and mighty Tamburlaine,\r\n    King Charlemagne, Tom Stukeley and the rest,\r\n    Adieu.\r\n\r\nThere are some possible but not very clear allusions to the Armada\r\nin the play. From 21 Feb. 1592 to 20 Jan. 1593 Strange’s men played\r\nfourteen times for Henslowe _Muly Mollocco_, by which this play, in\r\nwhich Abdelmelec is also called Muly Mollocco, is probably meant (Greg,\r\n_Henslowe_, ii. 149). The ‘plot’ must belong to a later revival by the\r\nAdmiral’s, datable, since both Alleyn and Shaw acted in it, either in\r\nDec. 1597 or in 1600–2 (cf. ch. xiii).\r\n\r\nThe authorship has been assigned to Peele, both on stylistic evidence\r\nand because ll. 467–72 appear over his name in R. A.’s _England’s\r\nParnassus_ (1600), but R. A. has an error in at least one of his\r\nascriptions to Peele, and he ascribes l. 49 of this play to Dekker\r\n(Crawford, _E. P._ xxxv. 398, 474; _M. S.

A theory that Shakespeare acted in the\r\nplay is founded on ll. 759–62, where after Baliol’s coronation Elinor\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    Now, brave John Baliol, Lord of Galloway\r\n    And King of Scots, shine with thy golden head!\r\n    Shake thy spears, in honour of his [i.e. Edward’s] name,\r\n    Under whose royalty thou wearest the same.\r\n\r\nThis is not very convincing.\r\n\r\nA play called _Longshank, Longshanks_, and _Prince Longshank_ was\r\nplayed fourteen times by the Admiral’s, from 29 Aug. 1595 to 14\r\nJuly 1596. It is marked ‘ne’, and unless there had been substantial\r\nrevision, can hardly be Peele’s play. ‘Longe-shanckes sewte’ is in\r\nthe Admiral’s inventory of 10 March 1598. On 8 Aug. 1602 Alleyn sold\r\nthe book of the play to the Admiral’s with another for £4.

R._ sc. xv) headed ‘Chorus 5’, contains the statement:\r\n\r\n            this storie lends vs other store,\r\n    To make a third discourse of Dauids life,\r\n\r\nand is followed by a misplaced fragment of a speech by Absalon.\r\n\r\nIn Oct. 1602 Henslowe (ii. 232) laid out money for Worcester’s on poles\r\nand workmanship ‘for to hange Absolome’; but we need not assume a\r\nrevival of Peele’s play.\r\n\r\n                   _The Old Wive’s Tale. 1591 < > 4_\r\n\r\n_S.

Peele borrowed some lines and the name Sacrapant from\r\nGreene’s _Orlando Furioso_ (1591). The hexameters of Huanebango are a\r\nburlesque of Gabriel Harvey.\r\n\r\n                             _Lost Plays_\r\n\r\n                         _Iphigenia. c. 1579_\r\n\r\nA translation of one of the two plays of Euripides, probably written at\r\nOxford, is only known by some laudatory verses of William Gager, _In\r\nIphigeniam Georgii Peeli Anglicanis versibus redditam_, printed by\r\nBullen, i. xvii.\r\n\r\n                       _Hunting of Cupid > 1591_\r\n\r\n_S.

Provyded\r\nalwayes that yf yt be hurtfull to any other Copye before lycenced, then\r\nthis to be voyde.’ _Richard Jones_ (Arber, ii. 591).\r\n\r\nProbably the play--I suppose it was a play--was printed, as Drummond\r\nof Hawthornden includes jottings from ‘The Huntinge of Cupid by George\r\nPeele of Oxford. Pastoral’ amongst others from ‘Bookes red anno 1609 be\r\nme’, and thereby enables us to identify extracts assigned to Peele in\r\n_England’s Parnassus_ (1600) and _England’s Helicon_ (1600) as from the\r\nsame source. The fragments are all carefully collected by W. W. Greg in\r\n_M. S. C._ i. 307.\r\n\r\n         _The Turkish Mahomet and Hiren the Fair Greek > 1594_\r\n\r\nThe _Merry Conceited Jests_ (Bullen, ii. 394) gives this as the title\r\nof a ‘famous play’ of Peele’s. Conceivably it, rather than Greene’s\r\n_Alphonsus_ (q.v.), may be the ‘Mahomet’s Poo’ of Peele’s _Farewell_ of\r\n1589 (_vide supra_, s.v. _Battle of Alcazar_). An Admiral’s inventory\r\nof 10 March 1598 includes ‘owld Mahemetes head’. The Admiral’s had\r\nplayed _Mahomet_ for Henslowe from 16 Aug. 1594 to 5 Feb. 1595, and a\r\nplay called _The Love of a Grecian Lady_ or _The Grecian Comedy_ from\r\n5 Oct. 1594 to 10 Oct. 1595. In Aug. 1601 Henslowe bought _Mahemett_\r\nfrom Alleyn, and incurred other expenses on the play for the Admiral’s\r\n(Henslowe, ii. 167; _Henslowe Papers_, 116). Possibly all the three\r\ntitles of 1594–5 stand for Peele’s play. Jacob Ayrer wrote a play on\r\nthe siege of Constantinople and the loves of Mahomet and Irene. This\r\nmay have had some relation on the one hand to Peele’s, and on the other\r\nto a play of the siege of Constantinople used by Spencer (cf. ch. xiv)\r\nin Germany during 1612–14 (Herz, 73). Pistol’s ‘Have we not Hiren\r\nhere?’ (_2 Hen. IV_, II. iv. 173) is doubtless from the play.\r\n\r\n                        _The Knight of Rhodes_\r\n\r\nThis also is described in the _Merry Jests_ (cf. ch. xxiv, s.v.\r\n_Soliman and Perseda_).\r\n\r\n                           _Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nPeele’s hand has been sought in nearly every masterless play of his\r\nepoch: _Alphonsus of Germany_, _Captain Thomas Stukeley_, _Clyomon\r\nand Clamydes_, _Contention of York and Lancaster_, _George a Greene_,\r\n_Henry VI_, _Histriomastix_, _Jack Straw_, _Troublesome Reign of King\r\nJohn_, _Knack to Know a Knave_, _Leire_, _Locrine_, _Mucedorus_,\r\n_Soliman and Perseda_, _Taming of A Shrew_, _True Tragedy of Richard\r\nIII_, _Wily Beguiled_, _Wisdom of Dr. Dodipoll_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n                            ENTERTAINMENTS\r\n\r\n                     _Dixie Pageant. 29 Oct. 1585_\r\n\r\n1585.

Albright, _P.’s Plays\r\nas Proof of the Elizabethan Stage_ (1913, _M. P._ xi. 237); G. F.\r\nReynolds, _W. P. and his Plays_ (1914, _M. P._ xii. 241).\r\n\r\nPercy’s authorship appears to be fixed by a correspondence between an\r\nepigram in the MS. to Charles Fitzgeffrey with one _Ad Gulielmum\r\nPercium_ in _Fitzgeoffridi Affaniae_ (1601), sig. D 2. 6.\r\n\r\n_The Cuck-Queanes and Cuckolds Errants_ is dated 1601 and _The Faery\r\nPastorall_ 1603. The other plays are unprinted and practically unknown,\r\nalthough Reynolds gives some account of _The Aphrodysial._ There are\r\nelaborate stage-directions, which contain several references to Paul’s,\r\nfor which the plays, whether in fact acted or not, were evidently\r\nintended, as is shown by an author’s note appended to the manuscript\r\n(cf. ch. xii, s.v. Paul’s).\r\n\r\nI feel some doubt as to the original date of these plays. It seems\r\nto me just conceivable that they were originally produced by the\r\nPaul’s boys before 1590, and revised by Percy after 1599 in hopes of\r\na revival. Some of the s.ds. are descriptive in the past tense (cf.\r\nch. xxii), which suggests actual production. The action of _C. and C.\r\nErrant_ is during the time of the Armada, but the composition must be\r\nlater than the death of Tarlton, as his ghost prologizes. Here the\r\nauthor notes, ‘Rather to be omitted if for Powles, and another Prologue\r\nfor him to be brought in Place’. _Faery Pastoral_ uses (p. 97) the date\r\n‘1647’; it is in fairy time, but points to some revision when the MS.\r\nwas written. There are alternative final scenes, with the note, ‘Be\r\nthis the foresayd for Powles, For Actors see the Direction at later end\r\nof this Pastorall, which is separate by itself, Extra Olens, as they\r\nsay’. Similarly in _Aphrodysial_ a direction for beards is noted ‘Thus\r\nfor Actors; for Powles without’, and another s.d. is ‘Chambers (noise\r\nsupposd for Powles) For Actors’. A reference to ‘a showre of Rose-water\r\nand confits, as was acted in Christ Church in Oxford, in Dido and\r\nAeneas’ is a reminiscence of Gager’s play of 12 June 1583, and again\r\nmakes a seventeenth-century date seem odd.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER (?) PETT (_c._ 1600).\r\n\r\nHenslowe’s diary records a payment of £6 on 17 May 1600 for the\r\nAdmiral’s ‘to pay Will: Haulton [Haughton] and Mr. Pett in full\r\npayment of a play called straunge newes out of Poland’. Fleay, i.\r\n273, says: ‘Pett is not heard of elsewhere. Should it not be Chett.,\r\n_i.e._ Chettle? The only Pett I know of as a writer is Peter Pett, who\r\npublished _Time’s journey to seek his daughter Truth_, in verse, 1599.’\r\nTo which Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 213, replies: ‘Henslowe often has Cett\r\nfor Chettle, which is even nearer, but only where he is crowded for\r\nroom and he never applies to him the title of Mr.’\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN PHILLIP (> 1570–> 1626).\r\n\r\nJohn Phillip or Phillips was a member of Queens’ College, Cambridge,\r\nand author of various ballads, tracts, and elegies, published between\r\n1566 and 1591. I do not know whether he may be the ‘Phelypes’, who was\r\napparently concerned with John Heywood and a play by Paul’s (q.v.)\r\nin 1559.

S._\r\nxlvi. 66).\r\n\r\nThe play has a Vice, and ends with prayer for Queen Elizabeth and the\r\nLord Mayor of ‘this noble Cytie’. Feuillerat, _Eliz._ 449, thinks it\r\ntoo crude to be the Court _Orestes_ of 1567–8, but the coincidence of\r\ndate strongly suggests that it was.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN POOLE (?).\r\n\r\nPossible author of _Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY PORTER (_c._ 1596–9).\r\n\r\nPorter first appears in Henslowe’s diary as recipient of a payment of\r\n£5 on 16 Dec. 1596 and a loan of £4 on 7 March 1597, both on account of\r\nthe Admiral’s. It may be assumed that he was already writing for the\r\ncompany, who purchased five plays, wholly or partly by him, between May\r\n1598 and March 1599. Meres, in his _Palladis Tamia_ of 1598, counts\r\nhim as one of ‘the best for Comedy amongst vs’. He appears to have\r\nbeen in needy circumstances, and borrowed several small sums from the\r\ncompany or from Henslowe personally (Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 304). On\r\n28 Feb. 1599, when he obtained £2 on account of _Two Merry Women of\r\nAbingdon_, ‘he gaue me his faythfulle promysse that I shold haue alle\r\nthe boockes w^{ch} he writte ether him sellfe or w^{th} any other’. On\r\n16 April 1599, in consideration of 1_s._ he bound himself in £10 to\r\npay Henslowe a debt of 25_s._ on the following day, but could not meet\r\nhis obligation. Porter is not traceable as a dramatist after 1599. His\r\nextant play, on the title-page of which he is described as ‘Gent.’,\r\nsuggests a familiarity with the neighbourhood of Oxford, and I see\r\nno _a priori_ reason why he should not be the Henry Porter, son of\r\na London gentleman, who matriculated from Brasenose on 19 June 1589\r\n(Boase and Clark, ii. 2, 170), or the Henricus Porter, apparently a\r\nmusician, of John Weever’s _Epigrammes_ (1599), v. 24, or the Henry\r\nPorter of Christ Church who became B.Mus. in July 1600 (Wood, _Fasti\r\nOxon._ i. 284), or the Henry Porter who was a royal sackbut on 21 June\r\n1603 (Nagel, 36), or the Henry Porter whose son Walter became Gentleman\r\nof the Chapel Royal on 5 Jan. 1616 and has left musical works (_D.\r\nN. B._). Gayley’s argument to the contrary rests on the unfounded\r\nassumption that the musician could not have been writing Bankside plays\r\nduring the progress of his studies for his musical degree.\r\n\r\n               _The Two Angry Women of Abingdon > 1598_\r\n\r\n1599.

Greg (1912, _M. S. R._).\r\n\r\nThe play shows no signs of being a sequel, and is presumably the First\r\nPart, to which Porter wrote a Second Part (_vide infra_) in the winter\r\nof 1598–9. It was an Admiral’s play, and therefore one would expect\r\nto find it in Henslowe’s very full, if not absolutely exhaustive,\r\nchronicle of the company’s repertory. Of the plays named as his by\r\nHenslowe, _Love Prevented_ seems the only likely title. But he was in\r\nthe pay of the company before the diary began to record the authorship\r\nof plays, and Part i may therefore be among the anonymous plays of\r\n1596–7 or an earlier season. Gayley suggests _The Comedy of Humours_,\r\nproduced 11 May 1597, but that is more plausibly identified with\r\nChapman’s _Humorous Day’s Mirth_ (q.v.). Another possibility is _Woman\r\nHard to Please_, produced 27 Jan. 1597.\r\n\r\n                             _Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nHenslowe’s diary records the following plays for the Admiral’s men, in\r\nwhich Porter had a hand in 1598 and 1599:\r\n\r\n(i) _Love Prevented._\r\n\r\nMay 1598. _Vide Two Angry Women of Abingdon, supra._\r\n\r\n(ii) _Hot Anger Soon Cold._\r\n\r\nWith Chettle and Jonson, Aug. 1598.\r\n\r\n(iii) _2 Two Angry Women of Abingdon._\r\n\r\nDec. 1598–Feb. 1599.\r\n\r\n(iv) _Two Merry Women of Abingdon._\r\n\r\nFeb. 1599.\r\n\r\n(v) _The Spencers._\r\n\r\nWith Chettle, March 1599.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS POUND (1538?-1616?).\r\n\r\nPound was of Beaumonds in Farlington, Hants, the son of William Pound\r\nand Anne Wriothesley, daughter of Thomas, first Earl of Southampton.\r\nWilliam Pound had a brother Anthony, whose daughter Honora married\r\nHenry, fourth Earl of Sussex (_V. H. Hants_, iii. 149; _Harl. Soc._\r\nlxiv. 138; Berry, _Hants Genealogies_, 194; _Recusant Rolls_ in\r\n_Catholic Record Soc._ xviii. 278, 279, 330, 334). Thomas was in youth\r\na Winchester boy, a Lincoln’s Inn lawyer, and a courtier of repute.\r\nAbout 1570 he left the world and became a fervent Catholic, and the\r\nrecord of his recusancy, of his relations with the Jesuit order, which\r\nhe probably joined, of the help he gave to Edmund Campion, and of his\r\nlong life of imprisonment and domiciliary restraint is written in H.\r\nMorus, _Historia Missionis Anglicanae Societatis Jesu_ (1660); D.\r\nBartoli, _Dell’ Istoria della Compagnia di Gesu: L’Inghilterra_ (1667);\r\nN.

Pollen,\r\n_English Catholics in the Reign of Elizabeth_ (1920), 333 _sqq._ I\r\nam only concerned with his worldly life and his quitting of it. As a\r\nWinchester _alumnus_, he is said to have delivered a Latin speech of\r\nwelcome to Elizabeth (Bartoli, 51), presumably at her visit of 1560\r\n(App. A), but he can hardly still have been a schoolboy; perhaps he\r\nwas at New College. He had already been entered at Lincoln’s Inn on 16\r\nFeb. 1560 (_Adm. Reg._ i. 66), and it was on behalf of Lincoln’s Inn\r\nthat he wrote and pronounced two mask orations which are preserved in\r\n_Bodl. Rawl. Poet. MS._ 108, ff. 24, 29, whence they are described in\r\nE. Brydges, _British Bibliographer_, ii. 612. Both seem to have been\r\nbefore Elizabeth (cf. vol. i, p. 162, and App. A). The first, at the\r\nwedding of his cousin Henry, Earl of Southampton, in Feb. 1566, is\r\nheaded in the manuscript ‘The copye of an oration made and pronounced\r\nby Mr. Pownde of Lyncolnes Inne, with a brave maske out of the same\r\nhowse, all one greatte horses att the mariage off the yonge erle\r\nof South hampton to the Lord Mountagues dawghter abowt Shrouetyde\r\n1565’. The second, at the wedding on 1 July 1566 of another cousin,\r\nFrances Radcliffe, is similarly headed ‘The copye of an oration made\r\nand pronounced by Mr. Pownd of Lincolnes Inne, with a maske att y^e\r\nmarriage of y^e Earl of Sussex syster to Mr. Myldmaye off Lyncolnes\r\nInne 1566’. From this, which is in rhyming quatrains, Brydges quotes\r\n119 lines; they are of no merit. In 1580 Pound wrote from his prison at\r\nBishop’s Stortford to Sir Christopher Hatton (_S. P. D. Eliz._ cxlii.\r\n20) commending a petition to the Queen, ‘for her poeticall presents\r\nsake, which her Majesty disdayned not to take at poore Mercuries hands,\r\nif you remember it, at Killiegeworth Castle’. The reference must be to\r\nthe Kenilworth visit of 1568, rather than 1573 or 1575, for soon after\r\nThomas Pound’s days of courtly masking came to an abrupt end. The story\r\nis told in Morus, 46:\r\n\r\n‘Natales Christi dies, ut semper solemnes, ita anno sexagesimo quarto\r\nfuere celeberrimi; dabantur in Curia ludi apparatissimi Thoma Pondo\r\ninstructore. Inter saltandum, nudam eius manum manu nuda prensat\r\nRegina, tum ei caput, abrepto Leicestrie Comitis pileo, ipsa tegit, ne\r\nex vehementi motu accensus subito refrigeraretur. Imposita ei videbatur\r\nlaurea: cum (secundo eandem saltationis formam flagitante Regina)\r\ncelerrime de more uno in pede circumuolitans, pronus concidit; Plausu\r\nin risum mutato, surge, inquit Regina, Domine Taure; ea voce commotus,\r\nsurrexit quidem; at flexo ad terram poplite, vulgatum illud latine\r\nprolocutus, _sic transit gloria mundi_, proripuit se, et non longo\r\ninteruallo Aulam spesque fallaces deseruit, consumptarum facultatum et\r\nviolatae Religionis praemium ludibrium consecutus.’\r\n\r\nThere is a little difficulty as to the date. Morus puts it in 1564,\r\nbut goes on to add that Pound was in his thirtieth year, and he was\r\ncertainly born in 1538 or 1539. And Bartoli, 51, followed by Tanner,\r\n480, gives 1569, citing, probably from Jesuit archives, a letter\r\nwritten by Pound himself on 3 June 1609. No doubt 1569, which may mean\r\neither 1568–9 or 1569–70, is right.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PRESTON (> 1569–1589 <).\r\n\r\nA Thomas Preston entered King’s, Cambridge, from Eton in 1553, and\r\nbecame Fellow in 1556, taking his B.A. in 1557 and his M.A. in 1561. At\r\nElizabeth’s visit in 1564 he disputed with Thomas Cartwright before her\r\nin the Philosophy Act, and also played in _Dido_, winning such favour\r\nthat she called him her ‘scholar’ and gave him a pension of £20 a year\r\nfrom the privy purse (Cunningham, xx; Nichols, _Eliz._ i. 270; Fuller,\r\n_Cambridge_, 137; Wordsworth, _Ecclesiastical Memorials_, iv. 322). He\r\nheld his fellowship at King’s until 1581. In 1583 a newswriter reported\r\nhim to be ‘withdrawen into Scotland as a malcontent and there made much\r\nof by the King’ (Wright, _Eliz._ ii. 215). In 1584 he became Master\r\nof Trinity Hall, and in 1589 was Vice-Chancellor. In 1592, with other\r\nHeads of Houses, he signed a memorial to Burghley in favour of the stay\r\nof plays at Cambridge (_M. S. C._ i. 192). It seems to me incredible\r\nthat he should, as is usually taken for granted, have been the author\r\nof _Cambyses_, about which there is nothing academic, and I think that\r\nthere must have been a popular writer of the same name, responsible for\r\nthe play, and also for certain ballads of the broadside type, of which\r\n_A Lamentation from Rome_ (Collier, _Old Ballads_, _Percy Soc._) was\r\nprinted in 1570, and _A Ballad from the Countrie, sent to showe how we\r\nshould Fast this Lent_ (_Archiv_, cxiv. 329, from _Bodl. Rawl. Poet.\r\nMS._ 185) is dated 1589. Both are subscribed, like _Cambyses_, ‘Finis\r\nQuod Thomas Preston’. A third was entered on S. R. in 1569–70 as ‘A\r\ngeliflower of swete marygolde, wherein the frutes of tyranny you may\r\nbeholde’.\r\n\r\nA Thomas Preston is traceable as a quarterly waiter at Court under\r\nEdward VI (_Trevelyan Papers_, i. 195, 200, 204; ii. 19, 26, 33), and\r\na choirmaster of the same name was ejected from Windsor Chapel as a\r\nrecusant about 1561 (cf. ch. xii).\r\n\r\n                           _Cambyses > 1570_\r\n\r\n_S.

T._).\r\n\r\nLine 1148 mentions Bishop Bonner whose ‘delight was to shed blood’, and\r\nFleay, 64, therefore dates the play 1569–70, as Bonner died 5 Sept.\r\n1569. But he may merely be put in the past as an ex-bishop. Three comic\r\nvillains, Huf, Ruf, and Snuf, are among the characters, and chronology\r\nmakes it possible that the play was the _Huff, Suff, and Ruff_ (cf.\r\nApp. A) played at Court during Christmas 1560–1. Preston may, however,\r\nhave borrowed these characters, as Ulpian Fulwell borrowed Ralph\r\nRoister, from an earlier play.\r\n\r\n                            _Doubtful Play_\r\n\r\nPreston has been suggested as the author of _Sir Clyomon and Clamydes_\r\n(cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL PRICE (1581–1631).\r\n\r\nA student of Exeter College, Oxford, who became chaplain to Prince\r\nHenry (_D. N. B._), and described his _Creation_ in 1610 (cf. ch. xxiv,\r\nC).\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD (?) PUTTENHAM (_c._ 1520–1601).\r\n\r\nThe author of _The Arte of English Poesie_ (1589; cf. App. C, No. xli)\r\nclaims to have written three plays, no one of which is extant. He\r\nanalyses at length the plot of his ‘Comedie entituled _Ginecocratia_’\r\n(Arber, 146), in which were a King, Polemon, Polemon’s daughter, and\r\nPhilino. He twice cites his ‘enterlude’, _Lustie London_ (Arber, 183,\r\n208), in which were a Serjeant, his Yeoman, a Carrier, and a Buffoon.\r\nAnd he twice cites his ‘enterlude’, _The Woer_ (Arber, 212, 233), in\r\nwhich were a Country Clown, a Young Maid of the City, and a Nurse.\r\n\r\nThe author of _The Arte_ is referred to by Camden in 1614 (cf.\r\nGregory Smith, ii. 444) as ‘Maister Puttenham’, and by E. Bolton,\r\n_Hypercritica_ (_c._ 1618), with the qualification ‘as the Fame is’, as\r\n‘one of her Gentlemen Pensioners, Puttenham’. H. Crofts, in his edition\r\n(1880) of Sir Thomas Elyot’s _The Governour_, has shown that this is\r\nmore likely to have been Richard, the elder, than George, the younger,\r\nson of Robert Puttenham and nephew of Sir Thomas Elyot. Neither\r\nbrother, however, can be shown to have been a Gentleman Pensioner, and\r\nCollier gives no authority for his statement that Richard was a Yeoman\r\nof the Guard. Richard was writing as far back as the reign of Henry\r\nVIII, and the dates of his plays are unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM RANKINS (> 1587–1601 <).\r\n\r\nThe moralist who published _A Mirrour of Monsters_ (1587), _The English\r\nApe_ (1588), and _Seven Satires_ (1598) is, in spite of the attack\r\non plays (cf. App. C, No. xxxviii) in the first of these, probably\r\nidentical with the dramatist who received payment from Henslowe on\r\nbehalf of the Admiral’s for the following plays during 1598–1601:\r\n\r\n(i) _Mulmutius Dunwallow._\r\n\r\nOct. 1598, £3, ‘to by a boocke’, probably an old one.\r\n\r\n(ii) _Hannibal and Scipio._\r\n\r\nWith Hathway, Jan. 1601.\r\n\r\n(iii) _Scogan and Skelton._\r\n\r\nWith Hathway, Jan.–Mar. 1601.\r\n\r\n(iv) _The Conquest of Spain by John of Gaunt._\r\n\r\nWith Hathway, Mar.–Apr. 1601, but never finished, as shown by a letter\r\nto Henslowe from S. Rowley, bidding him let Hathway ‘haue his papars\r\nagayne’ (_Henslowe Papers_, 56).\r\n\r\nRankins has also been suggested as the author of _Leire_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS RICHARDS (_c._ 1577).\r\n\r\nA possible author of _Misogonus_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY ROBERTS (_c._ 1606).\r\n\r\nA miscellaneous writer (_D. N. B._) who described the visit of the\r\nKing of Denmark to England (cf. ch. xxiv, C). The stationer of the same\r\nname, who printed the descriptions, may be either the author or his son\r\n(McKerrow, 229).\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ROBERTS (_c._ 1574).\r\n\r\nA contributor to the Bristol Entertainment of Elizabeth (cf. ch. xxiv,\r\nC).\r\n\r\n\r\nROBINSON.\r\n\r\nHenslowe paid £3 on behalf of the Admiral’s men on 9 Sept. 1602 ‘vnto\r\nM^r. Robensone for a tragedie called Felmelanco’. Later in the month he\r\npaid two sums amounting to another £3 to Chettle, for ‘his tragedie’ of\r\nthe same name. The natural interpretation is that Chettle and Robinson\r\nco-operated, but Fleay, i. 70, rather wantonly says, ‘Robinson was,\r\nI think, to Chettle what Mrs. Harris was to Mrs. Gamp’, and Greg,\r\n_Henslowe_, ii. 224, while not agreeing with Fleay, ‘It is, however,\r\nunlikely that he had any hand in the play. Probably Chettle had again\r\npawned his MS.’\r\n\r\nDates make it improbable that this Robinson was the poet Richard\r\nRobinson whose lost ‘tragedy’ _Hemidos and Thelay_ is not likely to\r\nhave been a play (cf. App. M).\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ROWLEY (?-1624).\r\n\r\nFor Rowley’s career as an Admiral’s and Prince’s man, cf. ch. xv.\r\n\r\n                             _Dr. Faustus_\r\n\r\nFor the additions by Rowley and Bird in 1602, cf. s.v.

D. Sykes, _The Authorship of The Taming of A Shrew, etc._ (1920,\r\n_Sh. Association_), argues, on the basis of a comparison of phraseology\r\nwith _When You See Me, You Know Me_ and some of the additions to _Dr.\r\nFaustus_, for Rowley’s authorship of (_a_) _The Famous Victories_,\r\n(_b_) the prose scenes of _A Shrew_, (_c_) the clowning passages in\r\nGreene’s _Orlando Furioso_, (_d_) the prose scenes of _Wily Beguiled_.\r\nHe suggests that the same collaborator, borrowing first from Marlowe\r\nand then from Kyd, may have supplied the verse scenes both of _A Shrew_\r\nand of _Wily Beguiled_. There is no external evidence to connect Rowley\r\nwith the Queen’s, and he only becomes clearly traceable with the\r\nAdmiral’s in 1598, but Mr. Sykes has certainly made out a stylistic\r\ncase which deserves consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM ROWLEY (?-1625 <).\r\n\r\nOf Rowley’s origin and birth nothing is known. He first appears as\r\ncollaborator in a play of Queen Anne’s men in 1607, and, although he\r\nmay have also acted with this company, there is no evidence of the\r\nfact. His name is in the patent of 30 March 1610 for the Duke of York’s\r\nmen with that of Thomas Hobbes, to whom his pamphlet _A Search for\r\nMoney_ (1609, _Percy Soc. ii_.) is dedicated. He acted as their payee\r\nfrom 1610 to 1615, and they played his _Hymen’s Holiday or Cupid’s\r\nVagaries_, now lost, in 1612. _A Knave in Print_ and _The Fool without\r\nBook_, entered as his on 9 Sept. 1653 (Eyre, i. 428), might be their\r\nanonymous two-part _Knaves_ of 1613. He contributed an epitaph on\r\nThomas Greene of the Queen’s to Cooke’s _Greene’s Tu Quoque_ (1614).\r\nFrom 1615 to March 1616 the Prince’s men seem to have been merged in\r\nthe Princess Elizabeth’s. They then resumed their identity at the Hope,\r\nand with them Rowley is traceable as an actor to 1619 and as a writer,\r\nin collaboration with Thomas Middleton (q.v.), Thomas Ford, and Thomas\r\nHeywood, until 1621. In 1621 he wrote an epitaph upon one of their\r\nmembers, Hugh Attwell, apparently as his ‘fellow’. It was still as a\r\nPrince’s man that he received mourning for James on 17 March 1625. But\r\nin 1621 and 1622 he was writing, with Middleton and alone, for the\r\nLady Elizabeth’s at the Cockpit, and in 1623 both writing and acting\r\nin _The Maid of the Mill_ for the King’s men, and prefixing verses to\r\nWebster’s _Duchess of Malfi_, which belonged to the same company. He\r\nhad definitely joined the King’s by 24 June 1625 when his name appears\r\nin their new patent, and for them his latest play-writing was done. In\r\naddition to what was published under his name, he is generally credited\r\nwith some share in the miscellaneous collection of the Beaumont and\r\nFletcher Ff. His name is not in an official list of King’s men in\r\n1629, but the date of his death is unknown. A William Rowley married\r\nIsabel Tooley at Cripplegate in 1637, but the date hardly justifies the\r\nassumption that it was the dramatist.\r\n\r\n_Dissertations_: P. G. Wiggin, _An Inquiry into the Authorship of the\r\nMiddleton-Rowley Plays_ (1897, _Radcliffe College Monographs_, ix); C.\r\nW. Stork, _William Rowley_ (1910, _Pennsylvania Univ.

This\r\ndating and the mention of the Red Bull justify us in regarding it as an\r\nearly play for Queen Anne’s men.\r\n\r\n                _A New Wonder, A Woman Never Vexed_ (?)\r\n\r\n_S.

Bullen,\r\n_Middleton_, i. lxxxix, and Stork, 17, concur as to the date, the\r\nformer regarding it as Middleton’s revised _c._ 1622 by Rowley,\r\nthe latter as practically all Rowley’s. These views are evidently\r\ninfluenced by the mention of the Children of the Revels on the\r\ntitle-page. Wiggin, 7, noting allusions to the battle of Prague in\r\n1620 and _Reynard the Fox_ (1621), thinks it alternatively possible\r\nthat Rowley wrote it under Middletonian influence for one of the later\r\nRevels companies _c._ 1622. There was no doubt a company of Children of\r\nthe Revels in 1622–3 (Murray, i. 198), but the name on a t.p. of 1633\r\nwould naturally refer to the still later company of 1629–37 (Murray, i.\r\n279).\r\n\r\n                       _The Birth of Merlin_ (?)\r\n\r\n1662.

R._ xvi. 129).\r\n\r\nKirkman’s attribution to Shakespeare and Rowley was first made in his\r\nplay-list of 1661 (Greg, _Masques_, liii). It is generally accepted\r\nfor Rowley, but not for Shakespeare. But Fleay, _Shakespeare_, 289,\r\non a hint of P. A. Daniel, gave Rowley a collaborator in Middleton,\r\nand later (ii. 105) treated the play as a revision by Rowley of the\r\n_Uther Pendragon_ produced by the Admiral’s on 29 April 1597. This\r\nview seems to rest in part upon the analogous character of _The\r\nMayor of Quinborough_. Howe thinks that Rowley worked up a sketch by\r\nMiddleton later than 1621, and attempts a division of the play on this\r\nhypothesis. But Stork, _Rowley_, 58, thinks that Rowley revised _Uther\r\nPendragon_ or some other old play about 1608. F. W. Moorman (_C. H._ v.\r\n249) suggests Dekker, and Wells Beaumont and Fletcher.\r\n\r\n                           _Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nThe ascription to Rowley on the t.p. of _The Thracian Wonder_ is not\r\ngenerally accepted.

Hawkins (1787).\r\n\r\nChamberlain, describing to Carleton James’s visit to Cambridge in\r\nMarch 1615, wrote (Birch, i. 304): ‘The second night [8 March] was a\r\ncomedy of Clare Hall, with the help of two or three good actors from\r\nother houses, wherein David Drummond, on a hobby-horse, and Brakin, the\r\nrecorder of the town, under the name of Ignoramus, a common lawyer,\r\nbore great parts. The thing was full of mirth and variety, with many\r\nexcellent actors; among whom the Lord Compton’s son, though least,\r\nyet was not worst, but more than half marred by extreme length.’\r\nOn 31 March he told Carleton (Birch, i. 360) of the Oxford satires\r\non the play, and of a possible second visit by the King, unless he\r\ncould persuade the actors to visit London. And on 20 May he wrote to\r\nhim (Birch, i. 363): ‘On Saturday last [13 May], the King went again\r\nto Cambridge, to see the play “Ignoramus”, which has so nettled the\r\nlawyers, that they are almost out of all patience.’ He adds that rhymes\r\nand ballads had been written by the lawyers, and answered. Specimens\r\nof the ‘flytings’ to which the play gave rise are in Hawkins, xxxvii,\r\nxlii, cvii, 259. Fuller, _Church History_ (1655), x. 70, reports a\r\nstory that the irritation caused to the lawyers also led to John\r\nSelden’s demonstration of the secular origin of tithes. The authorship\r\nof _Ignoramus_ is indicated by the entry in a notice of the royal visit\r\nprinted (Hawkins, xxx) from a manuscript in the library of Sir Edward\r\nDering:\r\n\r\n   ‘On Wednesday night, 2, _Ignoramus_, the lawyer, _Latine_, and\r\n   part _English_, composed by M^r. _Ruggle_, _Clarensis_.’\r\n\r\n_Ignoramus_ was largely based on the _Trappolaria_ (1596) of\r\nGiambattista Porta, into which Ruggle introduced his satire of the\r\nCambridge recorder, Francis Brackyn, who had already been the butt of\r\n_3 Parnassus_.\r\n\r\n                       _Doubtful and Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nThere is no justification for ascribing to Ruggle _Loiola_ (1648),\r\nwhich is by John Hacket, but Hawkins, lxxii, cites from a note made in\r\na copy of _Ignoramus_ by John Hayward of Clare Hall, _c._ 1741:\r\n\r\n   ‘N.B. M^r. Geo. Ruggle wrote besides two other comedies, _Re\r\n   vera_ or _Verily_, and _Club Law_, to expose the puritans, not\r\n   yet printed. MS.’\r\n\r\n_Club Law_ (cf. ch. xxiv) has since been recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SACKVILLE (1536–1608).\r\n\r\nThomas Sackville became Lord Buckhurst in 1567 and Earl of Dorset in\r\n1604.

He was son of John Heywood the dramatist, and\r\nuncle of John Donne. In 1562 he became a Jesuit, and left England, to\r\nreturn as a missionary in 1581. He was imprisoned during 1583–5 and\r\nthen expelled. John Studley (_c._ 1547–?) entered Trinity, Cambridge,\r\nin 1563 and became Fellow in 1567. Alexander Neville (1544–1614) took\r\nhis B.A. in 1560 at Cambridge. He became secretary successively to\r\nParker, Grindal, and Whitgift, archbishops of Canterbury, and produced\r\nother literary work, chiefly in Latin. Thomas Nuce (_ob._ 1617) was\r\nFellow of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, in 1562, and became Canon of Ely\r\nin 1585. Thomas Newton (_c._ 1542–1607) migrated in 1562 from Trinity,\r\nOxford, to Queens’, Cambridge, but apparently returned to his original\r\ncollege later. About 1583 he became Rector of Little Ilford, Essex. He\r\nproduced much unimportant verse and prose, in Latin and English, and\r\nwas a friend of William Hunnis (q.v.).\r\n\r\nFor a fragment of another translation of _Hercules Oetaeus_, cf. s.v.\r\nElizabeth. Archer’s play-list of 1656 contains the curious entry ‘Baggs\r\nSeneca’, described as a tragedy. Of this Greg, _Masques_, li, can make\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (1564–1616).\r\n\r\nNo adequate treatment of Shakespeare’s life and plays is possible\r\nwithin the limits of this chapter. I have therefore contented myself\r\nwith giving the main bibliographical data, in illustration of the\r\nchapters on the companies (Strange’s, Pembroke’s, Chamberlain’s, and\r\nKing’s) and the theatres (Rose, Newington Butts, Theatre, Curtain,\r\nGlobe, Blackfriars) with which he was or may have been concerned. I\r\nfollow the conjectural chronological order adopted in my article on\r\nShakespeare in the 11th ed. of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n[1619]. It is probable that the 1619 editions of _Merry Wives of\r\nWindsor_ (Q_{2}), _Pericles_ (Q_{4}), and the apocryphal _Yorkshire\r\nTragedy_ were intended to form part of a collection of plays ascribed\r\nto Shakespeare, and that the ‘1600’ editions of _Midsummer Night’s\r\nDream_ (Q_{2}) and _Merchant of Venice_ (Q_{2}) bearing the name of\r\nthe printer Roberts, the ‘1600’ edition of the apocryphal _Sir John\r\nOldcastle_ bearing the initials T. P., the ‘1608’ edition of _Henry V_\r\n(Q_{3}), the ‘1608’ edition of _King Lear_ (Q_{2}) lacking the name of\r\nthe ‘Pide Bull’ shop, and the undated edition of _The Whole Contention\r\nof York and Lancaster_ were all also printed in 1619 for the same\r\npurpose. The printer seems to have been William Jaggard, with whom was\r\nassociated Thomas Pavier, who held the copyright of several of the\r\nplays. Presumably an intention to prefix a general title-page is the\r\nexplanation of the shortened imprints characteristic of these editions.\r\nThe sheets of _The Whole Contention_ and _Pericles_ have in fact\r\ncontinuous signatures; but the plan seems to have been modified, and\r\nthe other plays issued separately. The bibliographical evidence bearing\r\non this theory is discussed by W. W. Greg, W. Jaggard, A. W. Pollard,\r\nand A. H. Huth in _2 Library_, ix. 113, 381; x. 208; and _3 Library_,\r\ni. 36, 46; ii. 101; and summed up by A. W. Pollard, _Shakespeare Folios\r\nand Quartos_, 81. Confirmatory evidence is adduced by W. J. Niedig,\r\n_The Shakespeare Quartos of 1619_ (_M. P._ viii. 145) and _False Dates\r\non Shakespeare Quartos_ (1910, _Century_, 912).\r\n\r\n_S.

Shakespear & Rob. Davenport’,\r\n    ‘Duke Humphery Will. Shakespear’,\r\n\r\nand in a supplementary list:\r\n\r\n    ‘A Play by Will. Shakespear.’\r\n\r\nOf _Henry II_, _Stephen_, _Duke Humphrey_, and _Iphis and Iantha_\r\nnothing more is known.\r\n\r\n_Cardenio_ is presumably the play given as ‘Cardenno’ and ‘Cardenna’\r\nby the King’s men at Court in 1612–13 and again on 8 June 1613 (App.\r\nB). Its theme, from _Don Quixote_, Part I, chh. xxiii-xxxvii, is that\r\nof _Double Falsehood, or the Distressed Lovers_, published in 1728\r\nby Lewis Theobald as ‘written originally by W. Shakespeare, and now\r\nrevised and adapted to the stage by M^r. Theobald’. In 1727 it had been\r\nproduced at Drury Lane. Theobald claimed to have three manuscripts,\r\nno one of which is now known. One had formerly, he said, belonged to\r\nBetterton, and was in the handwriting of ‘M^r. _Downes_, the famous\r\nOld Prompter’ (cf. App. I). Another came from a ‘Noble Person’, with a\r\ntradition ‘that it was given by our Author, as a Present of Value, to a\r\nNatural Daughter of his, for whose Sake he wrote it, in the Time of his\r\nRetirement from the Stage’. Theobald is much under suspicion of having\r\nwritten _Double Falsehood_ himself (cf. T. R. Lounsbury, _The First\r\nEditors of Shakespeare_, 145).\r\n\r\n‘The Historye of Henry the First, written by Damport’ was licensed for\r\nthe King’s men on 10 Apr. 1624 (_Var._ iii. 229, 319; Herbert, 27).\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD SHARPHAM (1576–1608).\r\n\r\nEdward was the third son of Richard Sharpham of Colehanger in East\r\nAllington, Devonshire, where he was baptized on 22 July 1576. He\r\nentered the Middle Temple on 9 Oct. 1594. He made his will on 22\r\nApr. 1608, and was buried on the following day at St. Margaret’s,\r\nWestminster. It may be inferred that he died of plague. Unless he is\r\nthe E. S. who wrote _The Discoveries of the Knights of the Post_\r\n(1597), he is only known by his two plays. There is no justification\r\nfor identifying him with the Ed. Sharphell who prefixed a sonnet to\r\nthe _Humours Heav’n on Earth_ (1605) of John Davies of Hereford,\r\ncalling Davies his ‘beloued Master’, or, consequently, for assuming\r\nthat he had been a pupil of Davies as writing-master at Magdalen,\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n_Dissertations_: G.

But nobody could well\r\nhave supposed Shakespeare to be indicated by the initials E. S., for\r\nwhich there is really no other candidate than Sharpham. The play must\r\nbe the further ‘Comicall discourses’ promised by the same publishers in\r\nthe epistle to _The Fleir_, and it may be added that Hayman (cf. _D. N.\r\nB._), like Sharpham, was a Devonshire man. The date may be taken to be\r\n1607, as the King’s Revels are not traceable earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SHEPPARD (> 1606–1652 <).\r\n\r\nThe known work of this miscellaneous writer belongs to 1646–52, and\r\nalthough it includes a political tract in dramatic form, it is only his\r\nvague claim of a share, possibly as amanuensis, in Jonson’s _Sejanus_\r\n(q.v.), which suggests that he might be the unknown S. S. whose\r\ninitials are on the title-page of _The Honest Lawyer_ (1616).\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR PHILIP SIDNEY (1554–86).\r\n\r\nBoth his entertainments were printed for the first time with the third\r\n(1598) edition of the _Arcadia_.\r\n\r\n                      _The Lady of May. 1579_ (?)\r\n\r\n1598. The Countesse of Pembrokes Arcadia. Written by Sir Philip Sidney\r\nKnight. Now the third time published, with sundry new additions of\r\nthe same Author. _For William Ponsonby._ [The description of the\r\nentertainment follows _Astrophel and Stella_ among the ‘new additions’,\r\nbeginning at the head of sig. 3 B3^v, without title or date.]\r\n\r\nReprints in 1599, 1605, 1613, 1621, 1622, 1623, 1627, 1629, 1633, 1638,\r\n1655, 1662, 1674 editions of the _Arcadia_.\r\n\r\n_Editions_ in Nichols, _Elizabeth^{1, 2}_, ii. 94 (1788–1823), and\r\nCollections of Sidney’s _Works_.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment was in the Garden. As the Queen entered the grove,\r\nAn Honest Man’s Wife of the Country delivered a speech and a written\r\nsupplication in verse, for decision of the case of her daughter. Then\r\ncame the daughter, chosen May Lady, and haled this way by six Shepherds\r\non behalf of her lover Espilus and six Foresters on behalf of her\r\nlover Therion. The case was put to the Queen by Laius an old Shepherd,\r\nRombus a Schoolmaster, and finally the May Lady herself. Espilus,\r\naccompanied by the Shepherds with recorders, and Therion, accompanied\r\nby the Foresters with cornets, sang in rivalry. A ‘contention’ followed\r\nbetween Dorcas, an old Shepherd, and Rixus, a young Forester, ‘whether\r\nof their fellows had sung better, and whether the estate of shepherds\r\nor foresters were the more worshipful’. Rombus tried to intervene. The\r\nMay Lady appealed to the Queen, who decided for Espilus. Shepherds and\r\nForesters made a consort together, Espilus sang a song, and the May\r\nLady took her leave.\r\n\r\nNichols assigns the entertainment to Elizabeth’s Wanstead visit of\r\n1578. But it might also belong to that of 1579, and possibly to that\r\nof 1582. In 1579, but not in 1578, the visit covered May Day. The\r\nreferences in the text are, however, to the month of May, rather than\r\nto May Day.\r\n\r\n                     _Pastoral Dialogue, c. 1580_\r\n\r\n1598. A Dialogue between two Shepherds, Vttered in a Pastorall Show at\r\nWilton. [Appended to _Arcadia_; cf. _supra_.]\r\n\r\n_Edition_ in A. B. Grosart, _Poems of Sidney_ (1877), ii. 50.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue between Dick and Will appears to belong to the series of\r\npoems motived by Sidney’s love for Penelope Devereux. It must therefore\r\ndate between August 1577, when Sidney first visited his sister, Lady\r\nPembroke, at Wilton, and his own marriage on 20 Sept. 1583. There is no\r\nindication that the Queen was present; not improbably the ‘Show’ took\r\nplace while Sidney was out of favour at Court, and was living at Wilton\r\nfrom March to August 1580.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN SINGER (?-1603 <).\r\n\r\nOn Singer’s career as an actor, see ch. xv.\r\n\r\nOn 13 Jan. 1603, about which date he apparently retired from the\r\nAdmiral’s, Henslowe paid him £5 ‘for his playe called Syngers\r\nvallentarey’ (Greg, _Henslowe_, i. 173; ii. 226). I think the term\r\n‘vallentarey’ must be used by Henslowe, rightly or wrongly, in the\r\nsense of ‘valedictory’. _Quips on Questions_ (1600), a book of\r\n‘themes’, is not his, but Armin’s (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SLY (?-1608).\r\n\r\nOn Sly’s career as an actor, see ch. xv.\r\n\r\nHe has been guessed at as the author of _Thomas Lord Cromwell_ (cf. ch.\r\nxxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nW. SMITH.\r\n\r\nThere are traceable (_a_) Wentworth Smith, who wrote plays for\r\nHenslowe’s companies, the Admiral’s, and Worcester’s during 1601–3\r\n(_vide infra_) and witnessed the will of W. Haughton in 1605; (_b_)\r\na W. Smith, who wrote _Hector of Germany_ and _The Freeman’s Honour_\r\n(_vide infra_); (_c_) a ‘Smith’, whose _Fair Foul One_ Herbert\r\nlicensed on 28 Nov. 1623 (Chalmers, _S. A._ 216; Herbert, 26); (_d_)\r\nif Warburton can be trusted, a ‘Will. Smithe’, whose _S^t George for\r\nEngland_ his cook burnt (_3 Library_, ii. 231). It is possible that\r\n(_a_) and (_b_) may be identical. A long space of time separates (_b_)\r\nand (_c_), and if (_d_) is to be identified with any other, it may\r\nmost plausibly be with (_c_). There is nothing to connect any one of\r\nthem with the William Smith who published sonnets under the title of\r\n_Chloris_ (1596), or with any other member of this infernal family, and\r\nthe ‘W. S.’ of the anonymous _Locrine_ (1595), _Thomas Lord Cromwell_\r\n(1602), _The Puritan_ (1607) is more probably, in each case, aimed at\r\nShakespeare.\r\n\r\n                   _The Hector of Germany, c. 1615_\r\n\r\n_S. R._ 1615, April 24 (Buck). ‘A play called The Hector of Germany,\r\nor the Palsgraue is a harmeles thinge.’ _Josias Harrison_ (Arber, iii.\r\n566).

Smith, with new Additions. _Thomas Creede for\r\nJosias Harrison._ [Epistle to Sir John Swinnerton, signed ‘W. Smith’;\r\nPrologue; after text, ‘Finis. W. Smyth.’ Some copies have a variant\r\nt.p.]\r\n\r\n_Edition_ by L. W. Payne (1906, _Pennsylvania Univ. Publ._).\r\n\r\nThe epistle says ‘I have begun in a former Play, called the Freemans\r\nHonour, acted by the Now-Seruants of the Kings Maiestie, to\r\ndignifie the worthy Companie of the Marchantaylors’. If the phrase\r\n‘Now-Seruants’ implies production before 1603, the identification of W.\r\nSmith and Wentworth Smith becomes very probable. The prologue explains\r\nthat the Palsgrave is not Frederick, since ‘Authorities sterne brow’\r\nwould not permit ‘To bring him while he lives upon the stage’, and\r\napologizes for the performance by ‘men of trade’.\r\n\r\n                             _Lost Plays_\r\n\r\nHenslowe assigns to Wentworth Smith a share in the following plays:\r\n\r\n                   _Plays for the Admiral’s, 1601–2_\r\n\r\n(i) _The Conquest of the West Indies._\r\n\r\nWith Day and Haughton, Apr.–Sept. 1601.\r\n\r\n(ii) _1 Cardinal Wolsey._\r\n\r\nWith Chettle, Drayton, and Munday, Aug.–Nov. 1601.\r\n\r\n(iii), (iv) _1, 2 The Six Clothiers._\r\n\r\nWith Hathway and Haughton, Oct.–Nov. 1601.

It is not\r\ncertain that Smith, or any one but Dekker, had a hand in Part 2,\r\nwhich was apparently not finished. Part 1 is doubtless represented by\r\nthe extant _Sir Thomas Wyatt_ of Dekker (q.v.) and Webster, in which\r\nnothing is at all obviously traceable to Smith.\r\n\r\n(xii), (xiii) _1, 2 The Black Dog of Newgate._\r\n\r\nWith Day, Hathway, and another, Nov. 1602–Feb. 1603.\r\n\r\n(xiv) _The Unfortunate General._\r\n\r\nWith Day and Hathway, Jan. 1602.\r\n\r\n(xv) _The Italian Tragedy._\r\n\r\nMarch 1603.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND SPENSER (1552–99).\r\n\r\nThe only record of Spenser’s dramatic experiments, unless they are\r\nburied amongst the anonymous plays of the Revels Accounts, is to be\r\nfound in his correspondence of April 1580 with Gabriel Harvey, who\r\nwrote, ‘I imagine your Magnificenza will hold us in suspense ... for\r\nyour nine English Commedies’, and again, ‘I am void of all judgment if\r\nyour Nine Comedies, whereunto in imitation of Herodotus, you give the\r\nnames of the Nine Muses (and in one mans fancy not unworthily) come\r\nnot nearer Ariosto’s Comedies, either for the fineness of plausible\r\nelocution, or the rareness of Poetical Invention, than that Elvish\r\nQueen doth to his Orlando Furioso’ (_Two other Very Commendable\r\nLetters_, in Harvey’s _Works_, i. 67, 95). I can hardly suppose that\r\nthe manuscript play of ‘Farry Queen’ in Warburton’s list (_3 Library_,\r\nii. 232) had any connexion with Spenser’s comedies.\r\n\r\n\r\nROD. STAFFORD.\r\n\r\nProbably the ‘Rod. Staff.’ who collaborated with Robert Wilmot (q.v.)\r\nin the Inner Temple play of _Gismond of Salerne_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM STANLEY, EARL OF DERBY (1561–1642).\r\n\r\nDerby seems to have had players from 1594 to 1618, who presumably acted\r\nthe comedies which he was said to be ‘penning’ in June 1599 (cf. ch.\r\nxiii), but none of these can be identified, although the company’s\r\nanonymous _Trial of Chivalry_ (1605) needs an author. A fantastic\r\ntheory that his plays were for the Chamberlain’s, and that he wrote\r\nthem under the name of William Shakespeare, was promulgated by J.\r\nGreenstreet in _The Genealogist_, n.s. vii. 205; viii. 8, 137, and has\r\nbeen elaborately developed by A. Lefranc in _Sous le Masque de ‘William\r\nShakespeare’_ (1919) and later papers in _Le Flambeau_ and elsewhere.\r\n_A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ was not impossibly written for his wedding\r\non 26 Jan. 1595 (cf. App. A and _Shakespeare Homage_, 154).\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN STEPHENS (> 1611–1617 <).\r\n\r\nA Gloucester man, who entered Lincoln’s Inn in 1611, but is only known\r\nby his slight literary performances, of which the most important are\r\nhis _Essayes_ of 1615 (cf.

Stephens claims the authorship in the second edition of\r\nhis _Essayes_ (1615). Kirkman (Greg, _Masques_, lxii) was misled into\r\nassigning it to ‘John Swallow’, by a too literal interpretation of F.\r\nC.’s lines:\r\n\r\n    One Swallow makes no Summer, most men say,\r\n    But who disproues that Prouerbe, made this Play.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN STUDLEY (_c._ 1545–_c._ 1590).\r\n\r\nTranslator of Seneca (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT TAILOR (_c._ 1613).\r\n\r\nTailor also published settings to _Sacred Hymns_ (1615) and wrote\r\ncommendatory verses to John Taylor’s _The Nipping or Snipping of\r\nAbuses_ (1614).\r\n\r\n                    _Hog Hath Lost His Pearl. 1613_\r\n\r\n_S.

Scott (1810, _A. B.\r\nD._ iii).\r\n\r\nSir H. Wotton wrote to Sir Edmund Bacon (Wotton, ii. 13): ‘On Sunday\r\nlast at night, and no longer, some sixteen apprentices (of what sort\r\nyou shall guess by the rest of the story) having secretly learnt a\r\nnew play without book, intituled _The Hog hath lost his Pearl_, took\r\nup the White-Fryers for their theatre: and having invited thither (as\r\nit should seem) rather their mistresses than their masters; who were\r\nall to enter _per bullettini_ for a note of distinction from ordinary\r\ncomedians, towards the end of the play the sheriffs (who by chance had\r\nheard of it) came in (as they say) and carried some six or seven of\r\nthem to perform the last act at Bridewel; the rest are fled. Now it\r\nis strange to hear how sharp-witted the City is, for they will needs\r\nhave Sir John Swinerton, the Lord Mayor, be meant by the Hog, and the\r\nlate Lord Treasurer [Lord Salisbury] by the Pearl.’ Swinnerton was Lord\r\nMayor in 1612–13. The letter is only dated ‘Tuesday’, but refers to\r\nthe departure of the King, which was 22 Feb. 1613, as on the previous\r\nday. This would give the first Sunday in Lent (21 Feb.) for the date\r\nof production. The phrase (I. i) ‘Shrove-Tuesday is at hand’ suggests\r\n14 Feb., but the date originally intended was very likely altered.\r\nThe Prologue refers to the difficulties of the producers. The play\r\nhad been ‘toss’d from one house to another’. It does not grunt at\r\n‘state-affairs’ or ‘city vices’. There had been attempts to ‘prevent’\r\nit, but it ‘hath a Knight’s license’, doubtless Sir George Buck’s. In\r\nI. i is some chaff, apparently directed at Garlic and the Fortune, and\r\nan interview between a player and one Haddit, who writes a jig called\r\n_Who Buys my Four Ropes of Hard Onions_ for four angels, and a promise\r\nof a box for a new play. Fleay, ii. 256, identifies Haddit with Dekker,\r\nbut his reasons do not bear analysis, and Haddit is no professional\r\nplaywright, but a gallant who has run through his fortune. A passage\r\nin Act III (Dodsley, p. 465) bears out the suggestion of satire on the\r\nhouse of Cecil.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD TARLTON (?-1588).\r\n\r\nOn his career as an actor, cf. ch. xv.\r\n\r\n                     _The Seven Deadly Sins. 1585_\r\n\r\n[_MS._] _Dulwich MS._ xix, ‘The platt of The secound parte of the Seuen\r\nDeadlie sinns.’ [This was found pasted inside the boards forming the\r\ncover to a manuscript play of the seventeenth century, _The Tell Tale_\r\n(_Dulwich MS._ xx).]\r\n\r\nThe text is given by Malone, _Supplement_ (1780), i. 60; Steevens,\r\n_Variorum_ (1803), iii. 404; Boswell, _Variorum_ (1821), iii. 348;\r\nCollier, iii. 197; Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, 129; and a photographic\r\nfacsimile by W. Young, _History of Dulwich_ (1889), ii. 5.\r\n\r\nThe ‘platt’ names a number of actors and may thereby be assigned\r\nto a revival by the Admiral’s or Strange’s men about 1590 (cf. ch.\r\nxiii). The play consisted of three episodes illustrating Envy, Sloth,\r\nand Lechery, together with an Induction. This renders plausible the\r\nconjecture of Fleay, 83, supported by Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 153, that\r\nit is the _Four Plays in One_ revived by Strange’s for Henslowe on\r\n6 March 1592. And if so, the original two parts may be traceable in\r\nthe _Five Plays in One_ and the _Three Plays in One_ of the Queen’s\r\nmen in 1585. Tarlton was of course a Queen’s man, and evidence of his\r\nauthorship is furnished by Gabriel Harvey, who in his _Four Letters_\r\n(1592, _Works_, i. 194) attacks Nashe’s _Pierce Penilesse_ (1592) as\r\n‘not Dunsically botched-vp, but right-formally conueied, according\r\nto the stile, and tenour of Tarletons president, his famous play of\r\nthe seauen Deadly sinnes; which most deadly, but most liuely playe, I\r\nmight haue seene in London; and was verie gently inuited thereunto at\r\nOxford by Tarleton himselfe’. Nashe defends himself against the charge\r\nof plagiarism in his _Strange News_ (1592, _Works_, i. 304, 318), and\r\nconfirms the indication of authorship.\r\n\r\n                            _Doubtful Play_\r\n\r\nTarlton has been suggested as the author of the anonymous _Famous\r\nVictories of Henry V_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN TAYLOR (1580–1653).\r\n\r\nKnown as the Water Poet. His description of the festivities at the\r\nwedding of Princess Elizabeth in 1613 (cf. ch. xxiv, C) is only one of\r\ninnumerable pamphlets in verse and prose, several of which throw light\r\non stage history. Many of these were collected in his folio _Workes_\r\nof 1630, reprinted with others of his writings by the Spenser Society\r\nduring 1868–78. There is also a collection by C. Hindley (1872).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES TILNEY (_ob._ 1586).\r\n\r\nSaid, on manuscript authority alleged by Collier, to be the author of\r\n_Locrine_ (cf. ch. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS TOMKIS (> 1597–1614 <).\r\n\r\nTomkis entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1597, took his B.A. in\r\n1600 and his M.A. in 1604, and became Fellow of Trinity in the same\r\nyear. He has been confused by Fleay, ii. 260, and others with various\r\nmembers of a musical family of Tomkins.\r\n\r\n                         _Lingua. 1602 < > 7_\r\n\r\n_S.

J. Furnivall from _Addl.\r\nMS._ 27632 in _7 N. Q._ ix. 382, notes ‘The combat of Lingua made by\r\nThom. Tomkis of Trinity colledge in Cambridge’, and this is rendered\r\nplausible by the resemblance of the play to _Albumazar_. It is clearly\r\nof an academic type. As to the date there is less certainty. G. C.\r\nMoore Smith (_M. L. R._ iii. 146) supports 1602 by a theory that a\r\ncompliment (IV. vii) to Queen Psyche is really meant for Elizabeth,\r\nand contains allusions to notable events of her reign. I do not find\r\nhis interpretations very convincing, although I should not like to say\r\nthat they are impossible. Fleay, ii. 261, starting from a tradition\r\nhanded down by the publisher of 1657 that Oliver Cromwell acted in the\r\nplay, conjectures that the play formed part of Sir Oliver Cromwell’s\r\nentertainment of James at Hinchinbrook on 27–9 April 1603, and that his\r\nfour-year-old nephew took the four-line part of Small Beer (_IV._ v).\r\nEither date would fit in with the remark in _III._ v, ‘About the year\r\n1602 many used this skew kind of language’. Boas, however, prefers a\r\ndate near that of publication, on account of similarities to passages\r\nin _Macbeth_. The play was translated as _Speculum Aestheticum_ for\r\nMaurice of Hesse-Cassel in 1613 by Johannes Rhenanus, who probably\r\naccompanied Prince Otto to England in 1611; cf. P. Losch, _Johannes\r\nRhenanus_ (1895).\r\n\r\n                           _Albumazar. 1615_\r\n\r\n_S.

Pegge from Sir Edward Dering’s MS. in _Gent.\r\nMag._ xxvi. 224, and a bursar’s account-book for 1615 has the entry,\r\n‘Given M^r. Tomkis for his paines in penning and ordering the Englishe\r\nCommedie at our Masters appoyntment, xx^{ll}’ (_3 N. Q._ xii. 155).\r\nChamberlain wrote to Carleton (Birch, i. 304) that ‘there was no great\r\nmatter in it more than one good clown’s part’. It is an adaptation\r\nof Giambattista Porta’s _L’Astrologo_ (1606). No importance is to be\r\nattached to the suggestion of H. I. in _3 N. Q._ ix. 178, 259, 302,\r\nthat Shakespeare was the author and wrote manuscript notes in a copy\r\npossessed by H. I. Dryden regards the play as the model of Jonson’s\r\n_Alchemist_ (1610):\r\n\r\n    Subtle was got by our Albumazar,\r\n    That Alchymist by our Astrologer.\r\n\r\nUnless Dryden was mistaken, the performance in 1615 was only a revival,\r\nbut the payment for ‘penning’ makes this improbable.\r\n\r\n                         _Doubtful Later Play_\r\n\r\nG. C. Moore Smith (_M. L. R._ iii. 149) supports the attribution by\r\nWinstanley to Tomkis of _Pathomachia or the Battle of Affections_\r\n(1630), also called in a running title and in _Bodl. MS. Eng.

His career as a\r\ndramatist was over by 1613, and from December of that year to his death\r\non 28 Feb. 1626 he seems himself to have been employed on foreign\r\nservice, mainly in the Low Countries but finally at Cadiz, where he was\r\nsecretary to the council of war under Sir Edward Cecil in 1625. He died\r\nin Ireland and left a widow Mary.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1878. J. C. Collins, _The Plays and Poems of C. T._ 2 vols.\r\n\r\n1888. J. A.

Its outstanding\r\nfeature was the affair of _England’s Joy_, but in 1606 he is said (_D.\r\nN.

Lawrence (ii. 57), _The Origin of the Theatre\r\nProgramme_.\r\n\r\nThe document appears to be a ‘bill’. It is 12¾ by 7¾ inches, and\r\ncontains a synopsis under nine heads, beginning with the civil wars\r\nfrom Edward III to Mary ‘induct by shew and in Action’, and continuing\r\nwith episodes from the reign of Elizabeth, who is England’s Joy. In\r\nsc. viii ‘a great triumph is made with fighting of twelue Gentlemen\r\nat Barriers’, and in sc. ix Elizabeth ‘is taken vp into Heauen, when\r\npresently appeares, a Throne of blessed Soules, and beneath vnder the\r\nStage set forth with strange fireworkes, diuers blacke and damned\r\nSoules, wonderfully discribed in their seuerall torments’. Apart from\r\nthe bill, Vennar must have given it out that the performers were to be\r\namateurs. Chamberlain, 163, writes to Carleton on 19 Nov. 1602:\r\n\r\n   ‘And, now we are in mirth, I must not forget to tell you of\r\n   a cousening prancke of one Venner, of Lincolns Inne, that\r\n   gave out bills of a famous play on Satterday was sevenight\r\n   on the Banckeside, to be acted only by certain gentlemen\r\n   and gentlewomen of account. The price at cumming in was two\r\n   shillings or eighteen pence at least; and when he had gotten\r\n   most part of the mony into his hands, he wold have shewed them\r\n   a faire paire of heeles, but he was not so nimble to get up on\r\n   horse-backe, but that he was faine to forsake that course, and\r\n   betake himselfe to the water, where he was pursued and taken,\r\n   and brought before the Lord Chiefe Justice, who wold make\r\n   nothing of it but a jest and a merriment, and bounde him over\r\n   in five pound to appeare at the sessions. In the meane time\r\n   the common people, when they saw themselves deluded, revenged\r\n   themselves upon the hangings, curtains, chairs, stooles, walles,\r\n   and whatsoever came in theire way, very outragiously, and made\r\n   great spoile; there was great store of good companie, and many\r\n   noblemen.’\r\n\r\nSimilarly John Manningham in his _Diary_, 82, 93, notes in Nov. 1602,\r\nhow\r\n\r\n   ‘Vennar, a gent. of Lincolnes, who had lately playd a notable\r\n   cunni-catching tricke, and gulled many under couller of a play\r\n   to be of gent. and reuerens, comming to the court since in a\r\n   blacke suit, bootes and golden spurres without a rapier, one\r\n   told him he was not well suited; the golden spurres and his\r\n   brazen face uns[uited].’\r\n\r\nOn 27 Nov. he adds, ‘When one said that Vennar the graund connicatcher\r\nhad golden spurres and a brazen face, “It seemes”, said R. R. “he hath\r\nsome mettall in him.”’ Vennar’s own account of ‘my publique default of\r\nthe Swan, where not a collier but cals his deere 12 pense to witnesse\r\nthe disaster of the day’ was given many years later in ‘_An Apology_:\r\nWritten by Richard Vennar, of Lincolnes Inne, abusively called Englands\r\nJoy. 1614’, printed by Collier in _Illustrations_ (1866), iii. It vies\r\nin impudence with the original offence. He had been in prison and was\r\nin debt, and ‘saw daily offering to the God of pleasure, resident at\r\nthe Globe on the Banke-side’. This suggested his show, ‘for which they\r\nshould give double payment, to the intent onely, men of ability might\r\nmake the purchase without repentance’. He continues:\r\n\r\n   ‘My devise was all sorts of musique, beginning with chambers,\r\n   the harpe of war, and ending with hounds, the cry of peace, of\r\n   which I was doubly provided for Fox and Hare. The report of\r\n   gentlemen and gentlewomens actions, being indeed the flagge\r\n   to our theater, was not meerely falcification, for I had\r\n   divers Chorus to bee spoken by men of good birth, schollers by\r\n   profession, protesting that the businesse was meerely abused\r\n   by the comming of some beagles upon mee that were none of the\r\n   intended kennell: I meane baylifes, who, siezing mee before the\r\n   first entrance, spoke an Epilogue instead of a Prologue. This\r\n   changed the play into the hunting of the fox, which, that the\r\n   world may know for a verity, I heere promise the next tearme,\r\n   with the true history of my life, to bee publiquely presented,\r\n   to insert, in place of musicke for the actes, all those\r\n   intendments prepared for that daies enterteinment.’\r\n\r\nLater on he says, ‘I presented you with a dumbe show’, and jests on\r\ngetting ‘so much mony for six verses’, which, I suppose, means that the\r\nperformance was intended to be a spoken one, but was broken off during\r\nthe prologue. Apparently the new entertainment contemplated by Vennar\r\nin 1614 was in fact given, not by him but by William Fennor, to whom\r\nJohn Taylor writes in his _A Cast Over Water_ (1615):\r\n\r\n    Thou brag’st what fame thou got’st upon the stage.\r\n    Indeed, thou set’st the people in a rage\r\n    In playing England’s Joy, that every man\r\n    Did judge it worse than that was done at Swan.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Upon S. George’s day last, sir, you gave\r\n    To eight Knights of the Garter (like a knave),\r\n    Eight manuscripts (or Books) all fairelie writ,\r\n    Informing them, they were your mother wit:\r\n    And you compil’d them; then were you regarded,\r\n    And for another’s wit was well rewarded.\r\n    All this is true, and this I dare maintaine,\r\n    The matter came from out a learned braine:\r\n    And poor old _Vennor_ that plaine dealing man,\r\n    Who acted England’s Joy first at the Swan,\r\n    Paid eight crowns for the writing of these things.\r\n    Besides the covers, and the silken strings.\r\n\r\nRobin Goodfellow, in Jonson’s _Love Restored_ (_1612_), calls the\r\nabsence of a mask ‘a fine trick, a piece of England’s Joy’, and three\r\ncharacters in the _Masque of Augurs_ (_1622_) are said to be ‘three\r\nof those gentlewomen that should have acted in that famous matter of\r\nEngland’s Joy in six hundred and three’--apparently a slip of Jonson’s\r\nas to the exact date. Other allusions to the ‘gullery’ are in Saville,\r\n_Entertainment of King James at Theobalds_ (1603); R. Brathwaite, _The\r\nPoet’s Palfrey_ (_Strappado for the Devil_, ed. J. W. Ebsworth, 160);\r\nJ. Suckling, _The Goblins_ (ed. Hazlitt, ii. 52); W. Davenant, _Siege\r\nof Rhodes_, Pt. ii, prol. It may be added that Vennar’s cozenage was\r\nperhaps suggested by traditional stories of similar tricks. One is\r\nascribed to one Qualitees in _Merry Tales, Wittie Questions and Quick\r\nAnsweres_, cxxxiii (1567, Hazlitt, _Jest Books_, i. 145). In this\r\nbills were set up ‘vpon postes aboute London’ for ‘an antycke plaie’\r\nat Northumberland Place and ‘all they that shoulde playe therin were\r\ngentilmen’. Another is the subject of one of the _Jests_ of George\r\nPeele (Bullen, ii. 389). W. Fennor, _The Compters Commonwealth_\r\n(1617), 64, tells of an adventure of ‘one M^r. Venard (that went by\r\nthe name of Englands Joy)’ in jail, where he afterwards died.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD DE VERE, EARL OF OXFORD (1550–1604).\r\n\r\nMeres (1598) includes the earl in his list of ‘the best for Comedy\r\namongst vs’ but although Oxford had theatrical servants at intervals\r\nfrom 1580 to 1602 (cf. ch. xiii), little is known of their plays, and\r\nnone can be assigned to him, although the anonymous _The Weakest Goeth\r\nto the Wall_ (1600) calls for an author. J. T. Looney, _Shakespeare\r\nIdentified_ (1920), gives him Shakespeare’s plays, many of which were\r\nwritten after his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS VERNEY (1584–1615).\r\n\r\nFrancis, the eldest son of Sir Edmund Verney of Penley, Herts., and\r\nClaydon, Bucks., entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1600, and was\r\nknighted on 14 March 1604. As a result of family disputes, he left\r\nEngland about 1608, and became a pirate in the Mediterranean, dying at\r\nMessina on 6 Sept. 1615 (_Verney Memoirs^2_, i. 47). G. C. Moore Smith\r\n(_M. L. R._ iii. 151) gives him the following play.\r\n\r\n                         _Antipoe. 1603 < > 8_\r\n\r\n[_MS._] _Bodl.

Presumably Verney\r\nwas the author, and Nicolas only a scribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTONY WADESON (_c._ 1601).\r\n\r\nHenslowe made payments to him on behalf of the Admiral’s in June and\r\nJuly 1601 for a play called _The Honourable Life of the Humorous Earl\r\nof Gloucester, with his Conquest of Portugal_, but these only amounted\r\nto 30_s._, so that possibly the play was not finished.\r\n\r\n                            _Doubtful Play_\r\n\r\nThe anonymous _Look About You_ (cf. ch. xxiv) has been ascribed to\r\nWadeson.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS WAGER (_c._ 1560).\r\n\r\nWager became Rector of St. James Garlickhithe on 28 March 1560. Some\r\nresemblance of his style to that of W. Wager has led to an assumption\r\nthat they were related.

If so, Shakespeare must have had access to it in\r\nmanuscript, and it must have been available before _c._ 1592. The\r\nepistle speaks of Warner as ‘having diverse of this Poetes Comedies\r\nEnglished, for the use and delight of his private friends, who in\r\nPlautus owne words are not able to understand them’. No others are\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WATSON (_c._ 1557–92).\r\n\r\nAn Oxford man, who took no degree, and a lawyer, who did not practise,\r\nWatson became an elegant writer of English and Latin verse. He won the\r\npatronage of Walsingham at Paris in 1581, and became a member of the\r\nliterary circle of Lyly and Peele. His most important volume of verse\r\nis the _Hekatompathia_ (1582) dedicated to the Earl of Oxford. At\r\nthe time of his death in Sept. 1592 he was in the service of William\r\nCornwallis, who afterwards wrote to Heneage that he ‘could devise\r\ntwenty fictions and knaveryes in a play which was his daily practyse\r\nand his living’ (_Athenaeum_, 23 Aug. 1890). This suggests that the\r\npoet, and not the episcopal author of _Absalon_ (_Mediaeval Stage_,\r\nii. 458), is the Watson included by Meres in 1598 amongst our ‘best\r\nfor Tragedie’. But his plays, other than translations, must, if they\r\nexist, be sought amongst the anonymous work of 1581–92, where it would\r\nbe an interesting task to reconstruct his individuality. In _Ulysses\r\nupon Ajax_ (1596) Harington’s anonymous critic says of his etymologies\r\nof Ajax, ‘Faith, they are trivial, the froth of witty Tom Watson’s\r\njests, I heard them in Paris fourteen years ago: besides what balductum\r\n[trashy] play is not full of them’. In the meantime Oliphant (_M. P._\r\nviii. 437) has suggested that he may be the author of _Thorny Abbey,\r\nor, The London Maid_, printed by one R. D. with Haughton’s _Grim, the\r\nCollier of Croydon_ in _Gratiae Theatrales_ (1662) and there assigned\r\nto T. W. Oliphant regards _Thorny Abbey_ as clearly a late revision of\r\nan Elizabethan play.\r\n\r\n                              TRANSLATION\r\n\r\n                           _Antigone > 1581_\r\n\r\n_S.

Camden.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN WEBSTER (?-> 1634).\r\n\r\nThere is little clue to the personal history of John Webster beyond the\r\ndescription of him on the title-page of his mayoral pageant _Monuments\r\nof Honour_ (1624) as ‘Merchant Taylor’, and his claim in the epistle to\r\nhave been born free of the company. The records of the Merchant Taylors\r\nshow that freemen of this name were admitted in 1571, 1576, and 1617,\r\nand that one of them was assessed towards the coronation expenses in\r\n1604. A John Webster, Merchant Taylor, also received an acknowledgement\r\nof a 15_s._ debt from John and Edward Alleyn on 25 July 1591 (Collier,\r\n_Alleyn Papers_, 14). A John Webster married Isabel Sutton at St.\r\nLeonard’s Shoreditch on 25 July 1590, and had a daughter Alice baptized\r\nthere on 9 May 1606. It has been taken for granted that none of the\r\nsixteenth-century records can relate to the dramatist, although they\r\nmay to his father. This presumably rests on the assumption that he must\r\nhave been a young man when he began to write for Henslowe in 1602.\r\nIt should, however, be pointed out that a John Webster, as well as a\r\nGeorge Webster, appears amongst the Anglo-German actors of Browne’s\r\ngroup in 1596 (cf. ch. xiv) and that the financial record in the\r\n_Alleyn Papers_ probably belongs to a series of transactions concerning\r\nthe winding up of a theatrical company in which Browne and the Alleyns\r\nhad been interested (cf. ch. xiii, s.v. Admiral’s). It is conceivable\r\ntherefore that Webster was an older man than has been suspected and had\r\nhad a career as a player before he became a playwright.\r\n\r\nGildon, _Lives of the Poets_ (1698), reports that Webster was parish\r\nclerk of St Andrew’s, Holborn. This cannot be confirmed from parish\r\nbooks, but may be true.\r\n\r\nAs a dramatist, Webster generally appears in collaboration, chiefly\r\nwith Dekker, and at rather infrequent intervals from 1602 up to 1624\r\nor later. In 1602 he wrote commendatory verses for a translation by\r\nMunday, and in 1612 for Heywood’s _Apology for Actors_. In 1613 he\r\npublished his elegy _A Monumental Column_ on the death of Prince Henry,\r\nand recorded his friendship with Chapman. His marked tendency to borrow\r\nphrases from other writers helps to date his work. He can hardly be\r\nidentified with the illiterate clothworker of the same name, who\r\nacknowledged his will with a mark on 5 Aug. 1625. But he is referred to\r\nin the past in Heywood’s _Hierarchie of the Angels_ (1635), Bk. iv, p.\r\n206, ‘Fletcher and Webster ... neither was but Iacke’, and was probably\r\ntherefore dead.\r\n\r\n                             _Collections_\r\n\r\n1830.

R._ xvi. 1).\r\n\r\nThe play is in Beeston’s list of Cockpit plays in 1639 (_Var._ iii.\r\n159), Webster’s authorship has generally been accepted, but Stoll,\r\n197, who put the play 1623–39, because of resemblances to _Julius\r\nCaesar_ and _Coriolanus_ which he thought implied a knowledge of F_{1},\r\ntraced a dependence upon the comic manner of Heywood. Similarly, Sykes\r\nis puzzled by words which he thinks borrowed from Heywood and first\r\nused by Heywood in works written after Webster’s death. He comes to\r\nthe conclusion that Heywood may have revised a late work by Webster.\r\nThere is much to be said for the view taken by Brooke and Clark, after\r\na thorough-going analysis of the problem, that the play is Heywood’s\r\nown, possibly with a few touches from Webster’s hand, and may have been\r\nwritten, at any date not long after the production of _Coriolanus_\r\non the stage (_c._ 1608), for Queen Anne’s men, from whom it would\r\nnaturally pass into the Cockpit repertory.\r\n\r\n                    _The White Devil. 1609 < > 12_\r\n\r\n1612.

Sykes, _The Date of W.’s Play, the W. D._ (1913,\r\n_11 N. Q._ vii. 342).\r\n\r\nThe epistle apologizes for the ill success of the play, on the ground\r\nthat ‘it was acted in so dull a time of winter, presented in so open\r\nand blacke a theater, that it wanted ... a full and understanding\r\nauditory’, and complains that the spectators at ‘that play-house’\r\ncare more for new plays than for good plays. Fleay, ii. 271, dates\r\nthe production in the winter of 1607–8, taking the French ambassador\r\ndescribed in III. i. 73 as a performer ‘at last tilting’ to be M.\r\nGoterant who tilted on 24 March 1607, since ‘no other Frenchman’s name\r\noccurs in the tilt-lists. It is nothing to Fleay that Goterant was not\r\nan ambassador, or that the lists of Jacobean tilters are fragmentary,\r\nor that the scene of the play is not England but Italy. Simpson found\r\nan inferior limit in a borrowing from Jonson’s _Mask of Queens_ on 2\r\nFeb. 1609. I do not find much conviction in the other indications of\r\na date in 1610 cited by Sampson, xl, or in the parallel with Jonson’s\r\nepistle to _Catiline_ (1611), with which Stoll, 21, supports a date in\r\n1612. The Irish notes which Stoll regards as taken from B. Rich, _A\r\nNew Description of Ireland_ (1610), in fact go back to Stanyhurst’s\r\naccount of 1577, and though there is a pretty clear borrowing from\r\nTourneur’s _Atheist’s Tragedy_, that may have been produced some time\r\nbefore its publication in 1611. Nor was Dekker necessarily referring\r\nto Webster, when he wrote to the Queen’s men in his epistle before _If\r\nthis be not a Good Play_ (1612): ‘I wish a _Faire_ and _Fortunate Day_\r\nto your _Next New-Play_ for the _Makers-sake_ and your _Owne_, because\r\nsuch _Brave Triumphes_ of _Poesie_ and _Elaborate Industry_, which my\r\n_Worthy Friends Muse_ hath there set forth, deserue a _Theater_ full of\r\nvery _Muses_ themselves to be _Spectators_. To that _Faire Day_ I wish\r\na _Full_, _Free_ and _Knowing Auditor_.’\r\n\r\nWebster’s own epistle contains his appreciation ‘of other mens worthy\r\nlabours; especially of that full and haightned stile of Maister\r\n_Chapman_, the labor’d and understanding workes of Maister _Johnson_,\r\nthe no lesse worthy composures of the both worthily excellent Maister\r\n_Beamont_, & Maister _Fletcher_, and lastly (without wrong last to be\r\nnamed) the right happy and copious industry of M. _Shakespeare_, M.\r\n_Decker_, & M. _Heywood_’.

Stoll, 29, quotes the\r\n_Anglopotrida_ of Orazio Busino (cf. the abstract in _V. P._ xv. 134),\r\nwhich appears to show that the play was on the stage at some date not\r\nvery long before Busino wrote on 7 Feb. 1618:\r\n\r\n   Prendono giuoco gli Inglesi della nostra religione come di\r\n   cosa detestabile, et superstitiosa, ne mai rappresentano\r\n   qualsivoglia attione pubblica, sia pura Tragisatiricomica,\r\n   che non inserischino dentro uitij, et scelleragini di qualche\r\n   religioso catolico, facendone risate, et molti scherni, con lor\r\n   gusto, et ramarico de’ buoni, fu appunto veduto dai nostri, in\r\n   una Commedia introdur’un frate franciscano, astuto, et ripieno\r\n   di varie impietà, cosi d’avaritia come di libidine: et il tutto\r\n   poi ruiscì in una Tragedia, facendoli mozzar la vista in scena.\r\n   Un altra volta rappresentarono la grandezza d’un cardinale,\r\n   con li habiti formali, et proprij molti belli, et ricchi, con\r\n   la sua Corte, facendo in scena erger un Altare, dove finse di\r\n   far oratione, ordinando una processione: et poi lo ridussero in\r\n   pubblico con una Meretrice in seno. Dimostrò di dar il Velleno\r\n   ad una sua sorella, per interesse d’honore: et d’ andar in\r\n   oltre alla guerra, con depponer prima l’habito cardinalitio\r\n   sopra l’altare col mezzo de’ suoi Cappellani, con gravità, et\r\n   finalmente si fece cingere la spada, metter la serpa, con tanto\r\n   garbo, che niente più: et tutto ciò fanno in sprezzo, delle\r\n   grandezze ecclesiastice vilipese, et odiate a morte in questo\r\n   Regno.\r\n                                  Di Londra a’ 7 febaio 1618.\r\n\r\nThe date of first production may reasonably be put in 1613–14. Crawford\r\nhas pointed out the resemblances between the play and _A Monumental\r\nColumn_ (1613) and definite borrowings from Donne’s _Anatomy of the\r\nWorld_ (1612), Chapman’s _Petrarch’s Seven Penitentiall Psalms_ (1612),\r\nand Chapman’s Middle Temple mask of 15 Feb. 1613. Lawrence thinks\r\nthat Campion’s mask of 14 Feb. 1613 is also drawn upon. But it is\r\nnot impossible that the extant text has undergone revision, in view\r\nof borrowings from the 6th edition (1615) of Sir Thomas Overbury’s\r\n_Characters_, to which Sykes calls attention, and of the apparent\r\nallusion pointed out by Vaughan in I. i. 5 to the purging of the French\r\nCourt by Louis XIII after the assassination of Marshall d’Ancre on\r\n14 April 1617. It need not be inferred that this is the ‘enterlude\r\nconcerninge the late Marquesse d’Ancre’, which the Privy Council\r\nordered the Master of Revels to stay on 22 June 1617 (_M. S. C._ i.\r\n376).\r\n\r\n                             _Later Plays_\r\n\r\n_The Devil’s Law Case_ (1623).\r\n\r\n_A Cure for a Cuckold_ (1661), with W.

Finch,\r\n‘Some of my other works, as The White Devil, The Duchess of Malfi,\r\nGuise and others, you have formerly seen’, and a _Guise_ is ascribed\r\nto him as a comedy in Archer’s play-list of 1656 and included without\r\nascription as a tragedy in Kirkman’s of 1661 and 1671 (Greg, _Masques_,\r\nlxxii). Rogers and Ley’s list of 1656 had given it to Marston (q.v.).\r\nCollier forged an entry in Henslowe’s diary meant to suggest that this\r\nwas the _Massacre at Paris_ (cf. s.v. Marlowe).\r\n\r\nIn Sept. 1624 Herbert licensed ‘a new Tragedy called _A Late Murther of\r\nthe Sonn upon the Mother_: Written by Forde, and Webster’ (Herbert, 29).\r\n\r\n                           _Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nThe ascription to Webster on the t.p. of _The Thracian Wonder_ is not\r\ngenerally accepted.

After a riotous youth, he turned to\r\nliterature interspersed with adventure, possibly acting at Canterbury\r\n_c._ 1571 (cf. ch. xv), serving in the Low Countries in 1572–4, the\r\nNewfoundland voyage in 1578–9, and the Low Countries again in 1585–6.\r\nHis chief literary associates were Thomas Churchyard and George\r\nGascoigne.\r\n\r\nAfter writing his one play, _Promos and Cassandra_, he translated\r\nits source, the 5th Novel of the 8th Decade of Giraldi Cinthio’s\r\n_Hecatomithi_ (1565) in his _Heptameron of Civil Discourses_ (1582).\r\nBoth Italian and English are in Hazlitt, _Shakespeare’s Library_ (1875,\r\niii). Like some other dramatists, Whetstone turned upon the stage, and\r\nattacked it in his _Touchstone for the Time_ (1584; cf. App. C, No.\r\nxxxvi).\r\n\r\n                     _Promos and Cassandra. 1578_\r\n\r\n_S.

Whetstone’s\r\nepistle is of some critical interest (cf. App. C, No. xix). In the\r\n_Heptameron_ he says the play was ‘yet never presented upon stage’.\r\nThe character of the s.ds. suggests, however, that it was written for\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL WIBURNE (_c._ 1597).\r\n\r\nPossible author of the academic _Machiavellus_ (cf.

B._) after personally consulting the register of St.\r\nLeonard’s Shoreditch, confirms the extract in Collier, iii. 348, of\r\nthe burial on 19 Aug. 1603 of ‘George Wilkins, the poet’. It must\r\ntherefore be assumed that the date of 9 Aug. 1613 given for the entry\r\nby T. E. Tomlins in _Sh. Soc. Papers_, i. 34, from Ellis’s _History\r\nof Shoreditch_ (1798) is an error, and that the ‘poet’ was distinct\r\nfrom the dramatist. Nothing is known of Wilkins except that he wrote\r\npamphlets from _c._ 1604 to 1608, and towards the end of that period\r\nwas also engaged in play-writing both for the King’s and the Queen’s\r\nmen. A George Wilkins of St. Sepulchre’s, described as a victualler and\r\naged 36, was a fellow witness with Shakespeare in _Belott v. Mountjoy_\r\non 19 June 1612 (C. W. Wallace, _N. U.

B.\r\nD._ ii) and J. S. Farmer (1913, _S. F. T._).\r\n\r\nThe play, which was based on the life of Walter Calverley, as given in\r\npamphlets of 1605, appears to have been still on the stage when it was\r\nprinted. An allusion in III. ii to fighting with a windmill implies\r\nsome knowledge of Don Quixote, but of this there are other traces by\r\n1607. The Clown is called Robin in II. ii, and Fleay, ii. 276, suggests\r\nthat Armin took the part. He comes in singing:\r\n\r\n    From London am I come,\r\n    Though not with pipe and drum,\r\n\r\nin reference to Kempe’s morris.\r\n\r\n                           _Doubtful Plays_\r\n\r\nWilkins probably wrote Acts I, II of _Pericles_, and it has been\r\nsuggested that he also wrote certain scenes of _Timon of Athens_; but\r\nthe relation of his work to Shakespeare’s cannot be gone into here.\r\n\r\nThe anonymous _Yorkshire Tragedy_ has also been ascribed to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT WILMOT (> 1566–91 <).\r\n\r\nA student of the Inner Temple, and afterwards Rector of North Ockendon,\r\nEssex, from 28 Nov. 1582 and of Horndon-on-the-Hill, Essex, from 2 Dec.\r\n1585.

E. C. T._) and J. S. Farmer (_S. F. T._) from\r\nMS.--_Dissertations_: J. W. Cunliffe, _Gismond of Salerne_ (1906, _M.\r\nL. A._ xxi. 435); A. Klein, _The Decorum of These Days_ (1918, _M. L.\r\nA._ xxxiii. 244).\r\n\r\nThe MSS. represent the play as originally produced, probably, from an\r\nallusion in one of the sonnets, at Greenwich. The print represents a\r\nlater revision by Wilmot, involving much re-writing and the insertion\r\nof new scenes and the dumb-shows. Webbe’s epistle is an encouragement\r\nto Wilmot to publish his ‘waste papers’, and refers to _Tancred_ as\r\n‘framed’ by the Inner Temple, and to Wilmot as ‘disrobing him of\r\nhis antique curiosity and adorning him with the approved guise of\r\nour stateliest English terms’. Wilmot’s own Epistle to the Readers\r\napologizes for the indecorum of publishing a play, excuses it by the\r\nexample of Beza’s _Abraham_ and Buchanan’s _Jephthes_, and refers to\r\n‘the love that hath been these twenty-four years betwixt’ himself and\r\nGismund. This seems to date the original production in 1567. But I\r\nfind no evidence that Elizabeth was at Greenwich in 1567. Shrovetide\r\n1566 seems the nearest date at which a play is likely to have been\r\ngiven there. Wilmot was clearly not the sole author of the original\r\nplay; to Act I he affixes ‘_Exegit Rod. Staff._’; to Act II, ‘_Per Hen.\r\nNo._’; to Act III, ‘_G. Al._’; to Act IV, ‘_Composuit Chr. Hat._’; to\r\nthe Epilogue, ‘_R. W._’ Probably Act V, which has no indication of\r\nauthorship, was also his own.\r\n\r\nW. H. Cooke, _Students Admitted to the Inner Temple, 1547–1660_ (1878),\r\ngives the admission of Christopher Hatton in 1559–60, but Wilmot is not\r\ntraceable in the list; nor are Hen. No., G. Al., or Rod. Staff. But\r\nthe first may be Elizabeth’s Gentleman Pensioner, Henry Noel (q.v.),\r\nand Cunliffe, lxxxvi, notes that a ‘Master Stafford’ was fined £5 for\r\nrefusing to act as Marshal at the Inner Temple in 1556–7.\r\n\r\n                            _Doubtful Play_\r\n\r\nHazlitt assigns to Wilmot _The Three Ladies of London_, but the R.

Gosson\r\ndescribes the play in 1582 (_P. C._ 185) together with a play in answer\r\ncalled _London Against the Three Ladies_, but does not indicate whether\r\neither play was then in print. In B ii Peter’s pence are dated as ‘not\r\nmuche more than 26 yeares, it was in Queen Maries time’. As the Act\r\nreviving Peter’s pence was passed in the winter of 1554–5, the play was\r\nprobably written in 1581.\r\n\r\n         _The Three Lords and Three Ladies of London. c. 1589_\r\n\r\n_S.

T._).--_Dissertation_: R. A. Law, _Y.’s T. L. T._ (1910,\r\n_M. L. R._ v. 167).\r\n\r\nThis deals in alternate scenes with (_a_) the murder of Beech by\r\nMerry on 23 Aug. 1594, and (_b_) a version, with an Italian setting,\r\nof the Babes in the Wood, on which a ballad, with a Norfolk setting,\r\nwas licensed in 1595. Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 208, following a hint of\r\nFleay, ii. 285, connects the play with Henslowe’s entries of payments,\r\non behalf of the Admiral’s, (i) of £5 in Nov. and Dec. 1599 to Day\r\nand Haughton for _Thomas Merry_ or _Beech’s Tragedy_, (ii) of 10_s._\r\nin Nov. 1599 and 10_s._ in Sept. 1601 to Chettle for _The Orphan’s\r\nTragedy_, and (iii) of £2 to Day in Jan. 1600 for an Italian tragedy.\r\nHe supposes that (ii) and (iii) were the same play, that it was\r\nfinished, and that in 1601 Chettle combined it with (i), possibly\r\ndropping out Day’s contributions to both pieces. Yarington he dismisses\r\nas a scribe. In the alternate scenes of the extant version he discerns\r\ndistinct hands, presumably those of Haughton and Chettle respectively.\r\nLaw does not think that there are necessarily two hands at all, finds\r\nimitation of _Leire_ (1594) in scenes belonging to both plots, and\r\nreinstates Yarington. Oliphant (_M. P._ viii. 435) boldly conjectures\r\nthat ‘Rob. Yarington’ might be a misreading of ‘W^m Haughton’. Bullen\r\nthought that this play, _Arden of Feversham_, and _A Warning for Fair\r\nWomen_ might all be by the same hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER YELVERTON (_c._ 1535–1612).\r\n\r\nYelverton entered Gray’s Inn in 1552. He is mentioned as a poet in\r\nJasper Heywood’s verses before Thomas Newton’s translation (1560) of\r\nSeneca’s _Thyestes_, and wrote an epilogue to the Gray’s Inn _Jocasta_\r\nof Gascoigne (q.v.) and Kinwelmershe in 1566. He also helped to devise\r\nthe dumb-shows for the Gray’s Inn _Misfortunes of Arthur_ of Thomas\r\nHughes (q.v.) on 28 Feb. 1588. He became a Justice of the Queen’s Bench\r\non 2 Feb. 1602 and was knighted on 23 July 1603.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PRINTED IN ENGLAND\r\n                    AT THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Cf. ch. xxii.\r\n\r\n[2] _Quarterly Review_ (April 1908), 446.\r\n\r\n[3] A copy at Berlin of the Strassburg _Terence_ of 1496 has the\r\nmanuscript note to the engraving of the _Theatrum_, ‘ein offen stat\r\nder weltlichkeit da man zu sicht, ubi fiunt chorei, ludi et de alijs\r\nleutitatibus, sicut nos facimus oster spill’ (Herrmann, 300). Leo\r\nBattista Alberti’s _De Re Edificatoria_ was written about 1451 and\r\nprinted in 1485. Vitruvius, _De Architectura_, v. 3–9, deals with\r\nthe theatre. The essential passage on the scene is v. 6, 8–9 ‘Ipsae\r\nautem scenae suas habent rationes explicitas ita, uti mediae valvae\r\nornatus habeant aulae regiae, dextra ac sinistra hospitalia, secundum\r\nautem spatia ad ornatus comparata, quae loca Graeci περιάκτους dicunt\r\nab eo, quod machinae sunt in his locis versatiles trigonoe habentes\r\nsingulares species ornationis, quae, cum aut fabularum mutationes sunt\r\nfuturae seu deorum adventus, cum tonitribus repentinis [ea] versentur\r\nmutentque speciem ornationis in frontes. secundum ea loca versurae sunt\r\nprocurrentes, quae efficiunt una a foro, altera a peregre aditus in\r\nscaenam. genera autem sunt scaenarum tria: unum quod dicitur tragicum,\r\nalterum comicum, tertium satyricum. horum autem ornatus sunt inter\r\nse dissimili disparique ratione, quod tragicae deformantur columnis\r\net fastigiis et signis reliquisque regalibus rebus; comicae autem\r\naedificiorum privatorum et maenianorum habent speciem prospectusque\r\nfenestris dispositos imitatione, communium aedificiorum rationibus;\r\nsatyricae vero ornantur arboribus, speluncis, montibus reliquisque\r\nagrestibus rebus in topeodis speciem deformati’; cf.

Guerrini, 1885), 45, 63, ‘Guardando avanti, se appresenta la\r\nfronte della scena, in v compassi distinta per mezzo di colonne quadre,\r\ncon basi e capitelli coperti de oro. In ciascuno compasso è uno uscio\r\ndi grandezza conveniente a private case.... La parte inferiore di\r\nquesta fronte di quattro frigi è ornata.... A gli usci delle scene\r\nfurono poste portiere di panno de oro. El proscenio fu coperto tutto\r\ndi tapeti con uno ornatissimo altare in mezzo.’ The side-doors were in\r\n‘le teste del proscenio’ (Palliolo, 98). I have not seen M. A. Altieri,\r\n_Giuliano de’ Medici, eletto cittadino Romano_ (ed. L. Pasqualucci,\r\n1881), or N.

The two Marsigli, with Il Bianchino and Nicoletto\r\nSegna, appear to have painted scenes and ships for the earlier\r\nFerrarese productions.\r\n\r\n[11] Ibid. 134.\r\n\r\n[12] Ibid. 381, from G. Campori, _Lettere artistiche inedite_, 5, ‘Era\r\nla sua forma quadrangula, protensa alquanto in longitudine: li doi lati\r\nl’uno al altro de rimpecto, havevano per ciaschuno octo architravi con\r\ncolonne ben conrespondenti et proportionate alla larghezza et alteza\r\nde dicti archi: le base et capitelli pomposissimamente con finissimi\r\ncolori penti, et de fogliami ornati, representavano alla mente un\r\nedificio eterne ed antiquo, pieno de delectatione: li archi con relevo\r\ndi fiori rendevano prospectiva mirabile: la largheza di ciascheuno era\r\nbraza quactro vel cerca: la alteza proporzionata ad quella. Dentro nel\r\nprospecto eran panni d’oro et alcune verdure, si come le recitationi\r\nrecerchavano: una delle bande era ornata delli sei quadri del Cesareo\r\ntriumpho per man del singulare Mantengha: li doi altri lati discontro\r\nerano con simili archi, ma de numero inferiore, che chiascheuno ne\r\nhaveva sei. Doj bande era scena data ad actorj et recitatorj: le doe\r\naltre erano ad scalini, deputati per le donne et daltro, per todeschi,\r\ntrombecti et musici. Al jongere del’ angulo de un de’ grandi et minorj\r\nlati, se vedevano quactro altissime colonne colle basi orbiculate, le\r\nquali sustentavano quactro venti principali: fra loro era una grocta,\r\nbenchè facta ad arte, tamen naturalissima: sopra quella era un ciel\r\ngrande fulgentissimo de varij lumi, in modo de lucidissime stelle, con\r\nuna artificiata rota de segni, al moto de’ quali girava mo il sole,\r\nmo la luna nelle case proprie: dentro era la rota de Fortuna con sei\r\ntempi: _regno_, _regnavj_, _regnabo_: in mezo resideva la dea aurea\r\ncon un sceptro con un delphin. Dintorno alla scena al frontespitio da\r\nbasso era li triumphi del Petrarcha, ancor loro penti per man del p^o.\r\nMantengha: sopra eran candelierj vistosissimi deaurati tucti: nel mezo\r\nera un scudo colle arme per tucto della C^a. M^g.; sopra la aquila\r\naurea bicapitata col regno et diadema imperiale: ciascheuno teneva tre\r\ndoppieri; ad ogni lato era le insegne. Alli doi maiorj, quelle della\r\nS^{ta}. de N.

Marchesana: sopre\r\nerano più alte statue argentate, aurate et de più colorj metallici,\r\nparte tronche, parte integre, che assai ornavano quel loco: poi ultimo\r\nera il cielo de panno torchino, stellato con quelli segni che quella\r\nsera correvano nel nostro hemisperio.’ Flechsig, 26, thinks that the\r\narchitect was Ercole Albergati (Il Zafarano).\r\n\r\n[13] D’Ancona, i. 485; _Mediaeval Stage_, ii. 79, 83, 135.\r\n\r\n[14] Ferrari, 50; D’Ancona, ii. 1, give examples of these at Ferrara\r\nand elsewhere. The _Favola d’Orfeo_, originally produced about 1471,\r\nseems to have been recast as _Orphei tragedia_ for Ferrara in 1486.\r\nIt had five acts, _Pastorale_, _Ninfale_, _Eroico_, _Negromantico_,\r\n_Baccanale_; in the fourth, the way to hell and hell itself were\r\nshown--‘duplici actu haec scena utitur’.\r\n\r\n[15] J.

Badius also edited a Paris\r\n_Terence_ of 1502, with _Praenotamenta_ based on Vitruvius and other\r\nclassical writers, in which he suggests the use in antiquity of ‘tapeta\r\n... qualia nunc fiunt in Flandria’.\r\n\r\n[19] Edition printed by Johannes Grüninger (Strassburg, 1496); cf.\r\nHerrmann, 318.\r\n\r\n[20] Editions printed by Lazarus Soardus (Venice, 1497 and 1499); cf.\r\nHerrmann, 346.

Müntz, _Hist. de l’Art pendant la Renaissance_, ii.\r\n299. Bramante was at Rome about 1505, and was helped on St. Peter’s\r\nby Baldassarre Peruzzi. But there is nothing obviously scenic in the\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\n[22] D’Ancona, ii. 394, ‘Ma quello che è stato il meglio in tutte\r\nqueste feste e representationi, è stato tute le sene, dove si sono\r\nrepresentate, quale ha facto uno M^o. Peregrino depintore, che sta\r\ncon il Sig^{re}.; ch’ è una contracta et prospettiva di una terra cum\r\ncase, chiesie, campanili et zardini, che la persona non si può satiare\r\na guardarla per le diverse cose che ge sono, tute de inzegno et bene\r\nintese, quale non credo se guasti, ma che la salvaràno per usarla de le\r\naltre fiate’.\r\n\r\n[23] Ibid., ‘il caso accadete a Ferrara’.\r\n\r\n[24] Ibid. 102, ‘La scena poi era finta una città bellissima con le\r\nstrade, palazzi, chiese, torri, strade vere, e ogni cosa di rilevo,\r\nma ajutata ancora da bonissima pintura e prospettiva bene intesa’;\r\nthe description has further details. Genga is not named, but Serlio\r\n(cf. App. G) speaks of his theatrical work for Duke Francesco Maria of\r\nUrbino (succ. 1508). Vasari, vi. 316, says that he had also done stage\r\ndesigns for Francesco’s predecessor Guidobaldo.\r\n\r\n[25] Vasari, iv. 600. Some of Peruzzi’s designs for _Calandra_ are in\r\nthe Uffizi; Ferrari (tav. vi) reproduces one.\r\n\r\n[26] D’Ancona, ii. 89, ‘Sonandosi li pifari si lasciò cascare la tela;\r\ndove era pinto Fra Mariano con alcuni Diavoli che giocavano con esso\r\nda ogni lato della tela; et poi a mezzo della tela vi era un breve che\r\ndicea: _Questi sono li capricci di Fra Mariano_; et sonandosi tuttavia,\r\net il Papa mirando con il suo occhiale la scena, che era molto bella,\r\ndi mano di Raffaele, et rappresentava si bene per mia fè forami di\r\nprospective, et molto furono laudate, et mirando ancora il cielo, che\r\nmolto si rappresentava bello, et poi li candelieri, che erano formati\r\nin lettere, che ogni lettera substenìa cinque torcie, et diceano: _Leo\r\nPon.

Marco at Venice as a _scenario_.\r\n\r\n[29] Cf. App. G. Book ii first appeared in French (1545).\r\n\r\n[30] De Sommi, _Dial._ iv (_c._ 1565, D’Ancona, ii. 419), ‘Ben che paia\r\ndi certa vaghezza il vedersi in scena una camera aperta, ben parata,\r\ndentro a la quale, dirò così per esempio, uno amante si consulti con\r\nuna ruffiana, et che paia aver del verisimile, è però tanto fuor del\r\nnaturale esser la stanza senza il muro dinanzi, il che necessariamente\r\nfar bisogna, che a me ne pare non molto convenirsi: oltre che non so\r\nse il recitare in quel loco, si potrà dire che sia in scena. Ben si\r\npotrà per fuggir questi due inconvenienti, aprire come una loggia od un\r\nverone dove rimanesse alcuno a ragionare’.\r\n\r\n[31] Creizenach, ii. 271.\r\n\r\n[32] Ferrari, 105, with engravings; A. Magrini, _Il teatro Olympico_\r\n(1847). This is noticed by the English travellers, Fynes Morison,\r\n_Itinerary_, i. 2. 4 (ed. 1907, i. 376), ‘a Theater for Playes, which\r\nwas little, but very faire and pleasant’, and T. Coryat, _Crudities_,\r\nii. 7, ‘The scene also is a very faire and beautifull place to behold’.\r\nHe says the house would hold 3,000. In _Histriomastix_, ii. 322, the\r\n‘base trash’ of Sir Oliver Owlet’s players is compared unfavourably\r\nwith the splendour of Italian theatres. A permanent theatre had been\r\nset up in the _Sala grande_ of the Corte Vecchia at Ferrara in 1529,\r\nwith scenery by Dosso Dossi representing Ferrara, for a revival of the\r\n_Cassaria_ and the production of Ariosto’s _Lena_; it was burnt down,\r\njust before Ariosto’s death, in 1532 (Flechsig, 23; Gardner, _King of\r\nCourt Poets_, 203, 239, 258).\r\n\r\n[33] Probably some temporary additions to the permanent decoration of\r\nthe _scena_ was possible, as Ferrari (tav. xv) gives a design for a\r\n_scenario_ by Scamozzi.\r\n\r\n[34] Ferrari, 100.\r\n\r\n[35] Engravings, by Jean de Gourmont and another, of this type of stage\r\nare reproduced by Bapst, 145, 153, and by Rigal in Petit de Julleville,\r\niii. 264, 296; cf.

A description of a tragi-comedy called\r\n_Genièvre_, based on Ariosto, at Fontainebleau in 1564 neglects the\r\nstaging, but gives a picture of the audience as\r\n\r\n                   une jeune presse\r\n    De tous costez sur les tapis tendus,\r\n    Honnestement aux girons espandus\r\n    De leur maîtresse.\r\n\r\nB.

Blomfield, _Hist. of\r\nFrench Architecture_, i. 81, who, however, thinks that Du Cerceau’s\r\n‘bastiment en manière de théâtre’ was not the long room, but the open\r\ncourtyard, in the form of a square with concave angles and semicircular\r\nprojections on each side, which occupies the middle of the block.\r\n\r\n[47] Prunières, _Ballet de Cour_, 72, 134.\r\n\r\n[48] Bapst, 147, reproduces an example.

For the use of curtains to effect these\r\ndiscoveries, cf. Rigal, 243, 253, who, however, traces to a guess of\r\nLemazurier, _Galerie Historique_, i. 4, the often repeated statement\r\nthat to represent a change of scene ‘on levait ou on tirait une\r\ntapisserie, et cela se faisait jusqu’à dix ou douze fois dans la même\r\npièce’.\r\n\r\n[58] It is so, e.g., in the design for _Agarite_.\r\n\r\n[59] ‘Non sic tolerari potest, ut longe lateque dissita loca in unum\r\nsubito proscenium cogantur; qua in re per se absurdissima et nullo\r\nveterum exemplo comprobata nimium sibi hodie quidam indulserunt’; cf.\r\nCreizenach, ii. 102. Spingarn, _Literary Criticism in the Renaissance_,\r\n89, 206, 290, discusses the origin of the unities, and cites\r\nCastelvetro, Poetica (1570), 534, ‘La mutatione tragica non può tirar\r\ncon esso seco se non una giornata e un luogo’, and Jean de la Taille,\r\n_Art de Tragédie_ (1572), ‘Il faut toujours représenter l’histoire ou\r\nle jeu en un même jour, en un même temps, et en un même lieu’.\r\n\r\n[60] _Mediaeval Stage_, ii. 257; Lawrence (i. 123), _Early French\r\nPlayers in England_. It is only a guess of Mr. Lawrence’s that these\r\nvisitors played _Maistre Pierre Patelin_, a farce which requires a\r\nbackground with more than one _domus_. Karl Young, in _M. P._ ii. 97,\r\ntraces some influence of French farces on the work of John Heywood.\r\nThere had been ‘Fransche-men that playt’ at Dundee in 1490, and\r\n‘mynstrells of Fraunce’, not necessarily actors, played before Henry\r\nVII at Abingdon in 1507.\r\n\r\n[61] Halle, i. 176.\r\n\r\n[62] Halle, ii. 86.\r\n\r\n[63] _Mediaeval Stage_, ii. 196; cf. ch. xii (Paul’s). Spinelli’s\r\nletter is preserved in Marino Sanuto, _Diarii_, xlvi. 595, ‘La sala\r\ndove disnamo et si rapresentò la comedia haveva nella fronte una grande\r\nzoglia di bosso, che di mezzo conteneva in lettere d’oro: _Terentii\r\nFormio_. Da l’un di canti poi vi era in lettere antique in carta:\r\n_cedant arma togae_. Da l’altro: _Foedus pacis non movebitur_. Sotto\r\npoi la zoglia si vide: _honori et laudi pacifici_.... Per li altri\r\ncanti de la sala vi erano sparsi de li altri moti pertinenti alla pace’.\r\n\r\n[64] _V. P._ iv. 115 translates ‘zoglia di bosso’ as ‘a garland of\r\nbox’, but Florio gives ‘soglia’ as ‘the threshold or hanse of a doore;\r\nalso the transome or lintle over a dore’.\r\n\r\n[65] Murray, ii. 168; cf. ch. xii (Westminster).\r\n\r\n[66] Halle, ii. 109.\r\n\r\n[67] Cf. ch. viii.\r\n\r\n[68] The memorandum on the reform of the Revels office in 1573, which\r\nI attribute to Edward Buggin, tells us (_Tudor Revels_, 37; cf. ch.\r\niii) that ‘The connynge of the office resteth in skill of devise,\r\nin vnderstandinge of historyes, in iudgement of comedies tragedyes\r\nand showes, in sight of perspective and architecture, some smacke of\r\ngeometrye and other thynges’. If Sir George Buck, however, in 1612,\r\nthought that a knowledge of perspective was required by the Art of\r\nRevels, he veiled it under the expression ‘other arts’ (cf. ch. iii).\r\n\r\n[69] _Mundus et Infans_, _Hickscorner_, _Youth_, _Johan Evangelist_,\r\n_Magnificence_, _Four Elements_, _Calisto and Melibaea_, _Nature_,\r\n_Love_, _Weather_, _Johan Johan_, _Pardoner and Friar_, _Four PP._,\r\n_Gentleness and Nobility_, _Witty and Witless_, _Kinge Johan_, _Godly\r\nQueen Hester_, _Wit and Science_, _Thersites_, with the fragmentary\r\n_Albion Knight_.

Albright, 29, attempts a\r\nclassification on the basis of staging, but not, I think, very\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n[73] Cf. e.g. _Hickscorner_, 544; _Youth_, 84, 201, 590, 633; _Johan\r\nJohan_, 667; _Godly Queen Hester_, 201, 635, 886; _Wit and Science_,\r\n969; _Wit and Wisdom_, 3, p. 60; _Nice Wanton_, 416; _Impatient\r\nPoverty_, 164, 726, 746, 861, 988; _Respublica_, V. i. 38; _Longer\r\nThou Livest_, 628, 1234; _Conflict of Conscience_, III. i. 2; _et ad\r\ninfinitum_.

The King\r\nrises from his Chair, comes forward’.\r\n\r\n[81] The Revels Accounts for 1511 (Brewer, ii. 1497) include 10_d._ for\r\na rope used for a ‘travas’ in the hall at Greenwich and stolen during a\r\ndisguising. Puttenham (1589), i. 17, in an attempt to reconstruct the\r\nmethods of classical tragedy, says that the ‘floore or place where the\r\nplayers vttered ... had in it sundrie little diuisions by curteins as\r\ntrauerses to serue for seueral roomes where they might repaire vnto and\r\nchange their garments and come in againe, as their speaches and parts\r\nwere to be renewed’.\r\n\r\n[82] There was a traverse in the nursery of Edward V in 1474; cf. _H.\r\nO._ *28, ‘Item, we will that our sayd sonne in his chamber and for all\r\nnighte lyverye to be sette, the traverse drawne anone upon eight of the\r\nclocke’.\r\n\r\n[83] Rimbault, 150, 167. There is an elaborate description of ‘a fayer\r\ntraverse of black taffata’ set up in the chapel at Whitehall for the\r\nfuneral of James in 1625 and afterwards borrowed for the ceremony in\r\nWestminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n[84] The chapel of Ahasuerus come in and sing (860). On the possibility\r\nthat plays may have been acted in the chapel under Elizabeth, cf. ch.\r\nxii.\r\n\r\n[85] _G. G. Needle_, I. iv. 34; II. iv. 20, ‘here, euen by this poste,\r\nIch sat’; _Jack Juggler_, 908, ‘Joll his hed to a post’.\r\n\r\n[86] The manuscript of _Misogonus_ was written at Kettering. The\r\nprologue of _Mary Magdalene_ is for travelling actors, who had given\r\nit at a university. _Thersites_ contains local references (cf. Boas,\r\n20) suggesting Oxford. Both this and _The Disobedient Child_ are\r\nadaptations of dialogues of Ravisius Textor, but the adapters seem to\r\nbe responsible for the staging.\r\n\r\n[87] Cf. ch. xxii.\r\n\r\n[88] II. ii. ‘Fowre women bravelie apparelled, sitting singing in\r\nLamiaes windowe, with wrought Smockes, and Cawles, in their hands, as\r\nif they were a working’. _Supposes_, IV. iv, is a dialogue between\r\nDalio the cook, at Erostrato’s window, and visitors outside. At the\r\nbeginning, ‘Dalio commeth to the wyndowe, and there maketh them\r\nanswere’; at the end, ‘Dalio draweth his hed in at the wyndowe, the\r\nScenese commeth out’. The dialogue of sc. v proceeds at the door, and\r\nfinally ‘Dalio pulleth the Scenese in at the dores’. In _Two Ital.\r\nGent._ 435, ‘Victoria comes to the windowe, and throwes out a letter’.\r\nIt must not be assumed on the analogy of later plays, and is in fact\r\nunlikely, that the windows of these early ‘houses’, or those of the\r\n‘case’ at Ferrara in 1486, were upper floor windows.\r\n\r\n[89] There is a reference to a falling curtain, not necessarily a stage\r\none, in _Alchemist_, IV. ii. 6, ‘O, for a suite, To fall now, like a\r\ncortine: flap’. Such curtains were certainly used in masks; cf. ch. vi.\r\n\r\n[90] Donne, _Poems_ (ed. Grierson), i. 441; J. Hannah, _Courtly Poets_,\r\n29. Graves, 20, quotes with this epigram Drummond, _Cypress Grove_,\r\n‘Every one cometh there to act his part of this tragi-comedy, called\r\nlife, which done, the courtaine is drawn, and he removing is said to\r\ndy’. But of course many stage deaths are followed by the drawing of\r\ncurtains which are not front curtains.\r\n\r\n[91] Inns of Court and University plays naturally run on analogous\r\nlines. For the ‘houses’ at Cambridge in 1564 and at Oxford in\r\n1566, cf. ch. vii. The three Cambridge Latin comedies, _Hymenaeus_\r\n(1579), _Victoria_ (_c._ 1580–3), _Pedantius_ (_c._ 1581), follow\r\nthe Italian tradition. For _Victoria_, which has the same plot as\r\n_Two Ital. Gent._, Fraunce directs, ‘Quatuor extruendae sunt domus,\r\nnimirum Fidelis, 1^a, Fortunij, 2^a, Cornelij, 3^a Octauiani, 4^a.\r\nQuin et sacellum quoddam erigendum est, in quo constituendum est\r\nCardinalis cuiusdam Sepulchrum, ita efformatum, vt claudi aperirique\r\npossit. In Sacello autem Lampas ardens ponenda est’. The earliest\r\nextant tragedies, Grimald’s _Christus Redivivus_ (_c._ 1540) and\r\n_Archipropheta_ (_c._ 1547), antedate the pseudo-Senecan influence.\r\nPractical convenience, rather than dramatic theory, imposed upon the\r\nformer a unity of action before the tomb. Grimald says, ‘Loca item,\r\nhaud usque eò discriminari censebat; quin unum in proscenium, facilè &\r\ncitra negocium conduci queant’. The latter was mainly before Herod’s\r\npalace, but seems to have showed also John’s prison at Macherus.\r\nThere is an opening scene, as in _Promos and Cassandra_, of approach\r\nto the palace (Boas, 28, 35). Christopherson’s _Jephthah_, Watson’s\r\n(?) _Absalon_, and Gager’s _Meleager_ (1582) observe classical unity.\r\nThe latter has two houses, in one of which an altar may have been\r\n‘discovered’. Boas, 170, quotes two s.ds., ‘Transeunt venatores e\r\nRegia ad fanum Dianae’ and ‘Accendit ligna in ara, in remotiore scenae\r\nparte extructa’. Gager’s later plays (Boas, 179) seem to be under the\r\ninfluence of theatrical staging. On Legge’s _Richardus Tertius vide_\r\np. 43, _infra_.\r\n\r\n[92] I do not suggest that the actual ‘templum’ in Serlio’s design,\r\nwhich is painted on the back-cloth, was practicable. The _ruffiana’s_\r\nhouse was. About the shop or tavern, half-way up the rake of the stage,\r\nI am not sure. There is an echo of the _ruffiana_, quite late, in\r\n_London Prodigal_ (1605), V. i. 44, ‘Enter Ruffyn’.\r\n\r\n[93] The early editions have few s.ds. Mr. Bond supplies many, which\r\nare based on a profound misunderstanding of Lyly’s methods of staging,\r\nto some of the features of which Reynolds in _M. P._ i. 581, ii. 69,\r\nand Lawrence, i. 237, have called attention.\r\n\r\n[94] Possibly I. i might be an approach scene outside the city, as\r\nprisoners are sent (76) ‘into the citie’, but this may only mean to the\r\ninterior of the city from the market-place.\r\n\r\n[95] Action is continuous between II. i, at the cave, and II. ii, in\r\nwhich Sapho will ‘crosse the Ferrie’. Phao told Sibylla (II. i. 14)\r\nthat he was out of his way and benighted, but this was a mere excuse\r\nfor addressing her.\r\n\r\n[96] The palace itself was not necessarily staged. If it was, it was\r\nused with the lunary bank, after visiting which Cynthia goes ‘in’ (IV.\r\niii. 171). She comes ‘out’ and goes ‘in’ again (V. iii. 17, 285), but\r\nthese terms may only refer to a stage-door. Nor do I think that the\r\n‘solitarie cell’ spoken of by Endymion (II. i. 41) was staged.\r\n\r\n[97] Yet Eumenides, who was sent to Thessaly in III. i, has only\r\nreached the fountain twenty years later (III. iii. 17), although he is\r\nbelieved at Court to be dead (IV. iii. 54). The time of the play cannot\r\nbe reduced to consistency; cf. Bond, iii. 14.\r\n\r\n[98] In IV. ii. 96 Protea, in a scene before the rock, says to\r\nPetulius, ‘Follow me at this doore, and out at the other’. During the\r\ntransit she is metamorphosed, but the device is rather clumsy. The\r\ndoors do not prove that a _domus_ of Erisichthon was visible; they may\r\nbe merely stage-doors.\r\n\r\n[99] Possibly _The Cobler’s Prophecy_ is also a Chapel or Paul’s play;\r\nit was given before an audience who ‘sit and see’, and to whom the\r\npresenters ‘cast comfets’ (39). The _domus_ required for a background\r\nare (_a_) Ralph’s, (_b_) Mars’s court, (_c_) Venus’s court, (_d_) the\r\nDuke’s court, (_e_) the cabin of Contempt. From (_a_) to (_b_) is ‘not\r\nfarre hence’ (138) and ‘a flight shoot vp the hill’ (578); between\r\nare a wood and a spot near Charon’s ferry. From (_b_) to (_c_) leads\r\n‘Adowne the hill’ (776). At the end (_e_) is burnt, and foreshortening\r\nof space is suggested by the s.d. (1564), ‘Enter the Duke ... then\r\ncompasse the stage, from one part let a smoke arise: at which place\r\nthey all stay’. At the beginning (3) ‘on the stage Mercurie from one\r\nend Ceres from another meete’. _Summer’s Last Will and Testament_,\r\nwhich cannot be definitely assigned either to the Chapel or to Paul’s,\r\ncontinues the manner of the old interlude; it has a stage (1570), but\r\nthe abstract action requires no setting beyond the tiled hall (205,\r\n359, 932, 974) in which the performance was given. _The Wars of Cyrus_\r\nis a Chapel play, but must be classed, from the point of view of\r\nstaging, with the plays given in public theatres (cf. p. 48).\r\n\r\n[100] Act III has the s.d., ‘_The storme. Enter Æneas and Dido in the\r\nCaue at seuerall times_’ (996).... ‘_Exeunt to the Caue_’ (1059). They\r\nare supposed to remain in the cave during the interval between Acts III\r\nand IV, after which, ‘_Anna._ Behold where both of them come forth the\r\nCaue’ (1075).\r\n\r\n[101] ‘_Here the Curtaines draw, there is discouered Iupiter dandling\r\nGanimed vpon his knee_’ (1).... ‘_Exeunt Iupiter cum Ganimed_’ (120).\r\nBut as Jupiter first says, ‘Come Ganimed, we must about this gear’, it\r\nmay be that they walk off. If so, perhaps they are merely ‘discouered’\r\nin the wood, and the curtains are front curtains.\r\n\r\n[102] So too (897),\r\n\r\n    This day they both a hunting forth will ride\r\n    Into these woods, adioyning to these walles.\r\n\r\n[103] At the end of the banquet scene (598), ‘_Exeunt omnes_’ towards\r\nthe interior of the palace, when ‘_Enter Venus at another doore, and\r\ntakes Ascanius by the sleeue_’. She carries him to the grove, and here\r\nhe presumably remains until the next Act (III), when ‘_Enter Iuno to\r\nAscanius asleepe_’ (811). He is then removed again, perhaps to make\r\nroom for the hunting party. I suppose the ‘_another doore_’ of 598 to\r\nmean a stage-door.\r\n\r\n[104] Cf. ch. xxii.\r\n\r\n[105] Direct evidence pointing to performance at Court is only\r\navailable for two of the five, _Cambyses_ and _Orestes_.\r\n\r\n[106] _Cambyses_, 75, 303, 380, 968, 1041, 1055; _Patient Grissell_,\r\n212, 338, 966, 1048, 1185, 1291, 1972, 1984, 2069; _Orestes_, 221,\r\n1108; _Clyomon and Clamydes_, 1421, 1717, 1776, 1901, 1907, 1931,\r\n1951, 2008, 2058, 2078; _Common Conditions_, 2, 110, 544, 838, 1397,\r\n1570; &c. Of course, the technical meaning of ‘place’ shades into the\r\nordinary one.\r\n\r\n[107] A similar instruction clears the stage at the end (1197) of a\r\ncorpse, as in many later plays; cf. p. 80.\r\n\r\n[108] The s.d. ‘one of their wives come out’ (813) does not necessarily\r\nimply a clown’s _domus_. _Cambyses_ fluctuates between the actor’s\r\nnotion that personages come ‘out’ from the tiring-house, and the\r\nearlier notion of play-makers and audience that they go ‘out’ from the\r\nstage. Thus ‘Enter Venus leading out her son’ (843), but ‘goe out Venus\r\nand Cupid’ at the end of the same episode (880).\r\n\r\n[109] ‘Come, let us run his arse against the poste’ (186); cf. pp. 27,\r\n75.\r\n\r\n[110] For later examples cf. p. 99.\r\n\r\n[111] Lawrence (i. 41), _Title and Locality Boards on the\r\nPre-Restoration Stage_.\r\n\r\n[112] Lawrence, i. 55. No English example of an inscribed miracle-play\r\n_domus_ has come to light.\r\n\r\n[113] Gregory Smith, _Elizabethan Critical Essays_, i. 185, 197\r\n(cf. App. C, No. xxxiv). Sidney’s main argument is foreshadowed in\r\nWhetstone’s Epistle to _Promos and Cassandra_ (1578; cf. App. C, No.\r\nxix), ‘The Englishman in this quallitie, is most vaine, indiscreete,\r\nand out of order; he fyrst groundes his worke on impossibilities: then\r\nin three howers ronnes he throwe the worlde: marryes, gets children,\r\nmakes children men, men to conquer kingdomes, murder monsters, and\r\nbringeth Gods from Heaven, and fetcheth Divels from Hel’.\r\n\r\n[114] Cf. p. 20.\r\n\r\n[115] Gibson had used written titles to name his pageant buildings; cf.\r\nBrewer, ii. 1501; Halle, i. 40, 54. The Westminster accounts _c._ 1566\r\n(cf. ch. xii) include an item for ‘drawing the tytle of the comedee’.\r\nThe Revels officers paid ‘for the garnyshinge of xiiij titles’ in\r\n1579–80, and for the ‘painting of ix. titles with copartmentes’ in\r\n1580–1 (Feuillerat, _Eliz._ 328, 338). The latter number agrees with\r\nthat of the plays and tilt challenges for the year; the former is\r\nabove that of the nine plays recorded, and Lawrence thinks that the\r\nbalance was for locality-titles. But titles were also sometimes used\r\nin the course of action. Thus _Tide Tarrieth for No Man_ has the\r\ns.d. (1439), ‘Christianity must enter with a sword, with a title of\r\npollicy, but on the other syde of the tytle, must be written gods word,\r\nalso a shield, wheron must be written riches, but on the other syde\r\nof the shield must be Fayth’. Later on (1501) Faithful ‘turneth the\r\ntitles’. Prologues, such as those of _Damon and Pythias_, _Respublica_,\r\nand _Conflict of Conscience_, which announce the names of the plays,\r\ntell rather against the use of title-boards for those plays. For the\r\npossible use of both title- and scene-boards at a later date, cf. pp.\r\n126, 154.\r\n\r\n[116] Cf. pp. 60, 63.\r\n\r\n[117] In the Latin academic drama the transition between classical\r\nand romantic staging is represented by Legge’s _Richardus Tertius_\r\n(1580). This is Senecan in general character, but unity of place is not\r\nstrictly observed. A s.d. to the first _Actio_ (iii. 64) is explicit\r\nfor the use of a curtain to discover a recessed interior, ’ A curtaine\r\nbeing drawne, let the queene appeare in y^e sanctuary, her 5 daughters\r\nand maydes about her, sittinge on packs, fardells, chests, cofers. The\r\nqueene sitting on y^e ground with fardells about her’.\r\n\r\n[118] Cf. p. 21.\r\n\r\n[119] Cf. ch. vii.\r\n\r\n[120] Feuillerat, _Eliz._ 365.\r\n\r\n[121] Cf. ch. xi.\r\n\r\n[122] There are four presenters, but, in order to avoid crowding the\r\nstage, they are reduced to two by the sending of the others to bed\r\nwithin the hut (128).\r\n\r\n[123] Albright, 66; Reynolds, i. 11.\r\n\r\n[124] Queen’s, _Three Lords and Three Ladies of London_, _1, 2\r\nTroublesome Reign of King John_, _Selimus_, _Looking-Glass for London\r\nand England_, _Famous Victories of Henry V_, _James IV_, _King Leir_,\r\n_True Tragedy of Richard III_; Sussex’s, _George a Greene_, _Titus\r\nAndronicus_; Pembroke’s, _Edward II_, _Taming of a Shrew_, _2, 3\r\nHenry VI_, _Richard III_; Strange’s or Admiral’s, _1, 2 Tamburlaine_,\r\n_Spanish Tragedy_, _Orlando Furioso_, _Fair Em_, _Battle of Alcazar_,\r\n_Knack to Know a Knave_, _Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_, _1 Henry\r\nVI_, _Comedy of Errors_, _Jew of Malta_, _Wounds of Civil War_, _Dr.\r\nFaustus_, _Four Prentices of London_; Admiral’s, _Knack to Know an\r\nHonest Man_, _Blind Beggar of Alexandria_, _Humorous Day’s Mirth_, _Two\r\nAngry Women of Abingdon_, _Look About You_, _Shoemaker’s Holiday_,\r\n_Old Fortunatus_, _Patient Grissell_, _1 Sir John Oldcastle_, _Captain\r\nThomas Stukeley_, _1, 2 Robert Earl of Huntingdon_, _Englishmen for my\r\nMoney_; Chamberlain’s, _Edward III_, _1 Richard II_, _Sir Thomas More_,\r\n_Taming of the Shrew_, _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, _Love’s Labour’s\r\nLost_, _Romeo and Juliet_, _Midsummer Night’s Dream_, _Richard II_,\r\n_King John_, _Merchant of Venice_, _1, 2 Henry IV_, _Every Man in his\r\nHumour_, _Warning for Fair Women_, _A Larum for London_, _Thomas Lord\r\nCromwell_ (the last two possibly Globe plays); Derby’s, _1, 2 Edward\r\nIV_, _Trial of Chivalry_; Oxford’s, _Weakest Goeth to the Wall_;\r\nChapel, _Wars of Cyrus_; Unknown, _Arden of Feversham_, _Soliman\r\nand Perseda_, _Edward I_, _Jack Straw_, _Locrine_, _Mucedorus_,\r\n_Alphonsus_, _1, 2 Contention of York and Lancaster_.\r\n\r\n[125] _Quarterly Review_, ccviii. 446.\r\n\r\n[126] I here use ‘scene’ in the sense of a continuous section of action\r\nin an unchanged locality, and do not follow either the usage of the\r\nplaywrights, which tends to be based upon the neo-classical principle\r\nthat the entrance or exit of a speaker of importance constitutes a\r\nfresh scene, or the divisions of the editors, who often assume a change\r\nof locality where none has taken place; cf. ch. xxii. I do not regard\r\na scene as broken by a momentary clearance of the stage, or by the\r\nopening of a recess in the background while speakers remain on the\r\nstage, or by the transference of action from one point to another of\r\nthe background if this transference merely represents a journey over a\r\nforeshortened distance between neighbouring houses.\r\n\r\n[127] Albright, 114; Thorndike, 102.\r\n\r\n[128] _Downfall of R.

How far there is\r\ninterior action is not clear. None is suggested by II. or V. In III.\r\niii (Q_{2}) the Friar bids Romeo ‘come forth’ (1), and Romeo falls\r\n‘upon the ground’ (69). Then ‘Enter Nurse and knocke’ (71). After\r\ndiscussing the knock, which is twice repeated, the Friar bids Romeo\r\n‘Run to my study’ and calls ‘I come’. Then ‘Enter Nurse’ (79) with ‘Let\r\nme come in’. Romeo has not gone, but is still ‘There on the ground’\r\n(83). Q_{1} is in the main consistent with this, but the first s.d. is\r\nmerely ‘Nurse knockes’, and after talking to Romeo, ‘Nurse offers to\r\ngoe in and turnes againe’ (163). In IV. i (Q_{1}, and Q_{2}) the Friar\r\nobserves Juliet coming ‘towards my Cell’ (17), and later Juliet says\r\n‘Shut the door’ (44); cf. p. 83.\r\n\r\n[130] _Downfall of R.

In _T. N.\r\nK._ (King’s, _c. 1613_), III. i. 31, ‘Enter Palamon as out of a Bush’,\r\nbut cf. III. vi. 1, ‘Enter Palamon from the Bush’. The Prologue to\r\n_Woman Killed with Kindness_ (Worcester’s, _1603_) says:\r\n\r\n    I come but like a harbinger, being sent\r\n      To tell you what these preparations mean:\r\n    Look for no glorious state; our Muse is bent\r\n      Upon a barren subject, a bare scene.\r\n    We could afford this twig a timber tree.\r\n      Whose strength might boldly on your favours build;\r\n    Our russet, tissue; drone, a honey bee;\r\n      Our barren plot, a large and spacious field.\r\n\r\nThese rhetorical antitheses are an apology for meanness of theme,\r\nrather than, like the prologues to _Henry V_, for scenic imperfections,\r\nand I hesitate to believe that, when the actor said ‘twig’, he pointed\r\nto a branch which served as sole symbol on the stage for a woodland.\r\n\r\n[137] _Looking-Glass_, V. iii. 2059, 2075, ‘Lo, a pleasant shade, a\r\nspreading vine ... _A Serpent deuoureth the vine_’; _O.

Thus in _2 Troub. Raigne_, sc. i, ‘Enter yong Arthur on\r\nthe walls.... He leapes’ (cf. _K. J._ IV. iii); in _1 Contention_, sc.\r\nxvi, ‘Enter the Lord Skayles vpon the Tower walles walking. Enter three\r\nor four Citizens below’ (cf. _2 Hen. VI_, IV. v). Analogous is _2 Hen.\r\nVI_, IV. ix (Kenilworth), ‘Enter King, Queene, and Somerset on the\r\nTarras.... Enter Multitudes with Halters about their neckes’.\r\n\r\n[147] In _Alarum for London_, 203, a gun is fired at Antwerp from the\r\nwalls of the castle; cf. _1 Hen. VI_ below.\r\n\r\n[148] _2 Tamburlaine_, V. i, ‘Enter the Gouernour of Babylon vpon\r\nthe walles’ ... (after parley) ‘Alarme, and they scale the walles’,\r\nafter which the governor is hung in chains from the walls and shot at;\r\n_Selimus_, 1200, ‘Alarum, Scale the walles’, 2391, ‘Allarum, beats\r\nthem off the walles; cf. _1 Hen. VI_ below. _Hen. V_, III. i-iii (a\r\ncontinuous scene) opens with ‘Alarum: Scaling Ladders at Harflew’.\r\nHenry says ‘Once more vnto the breach’, but later a parley is sounded\r\nfrom the town, and ‘Enter the King and all his Traine before the\r\nGates’, where submission is made, and they ‘enter the Towne’. Sometimes\r\nan assault appears to be on the gates rather than the walls; e.g. _1\r\nEdw. IV_, I. iv-vi; _1 Hen. VI_, I. iii.\r\n\r\n[149] Cf. p. 106, n. 6. The fullest use of walls is made in _1 Hen.\r\nVI_, a sixteenth-century play, although the extant text was first\r\nprinted in 1623. An analysis is necessary. The walls are those of\r\nOrleans in I, II, of Rouen in III, of Bordeaux in IV, of Angiers in V.\r\nIn I. iv, ‘Enter the Master Gunner of Orleance, and his Boy’. They tell\r\nhow\r\n\r\n       the English, in the suburbs close entrencht,\r\n    Wont through a secret grate of iron barres,\r\n    In yonder tower, to ouer-peere the citie.\r\n\r\nThe Gunner bids the Boy watch, and tell him if he sees\r\nany English. Then ‘Enter Salisbury and Talbot on the turrets, with\r\nothers’, and later ‘Enter the Boy with a Linstock’. The English talk of\r\nattacking ‘heere, at the bulwarke of the bridge’, and ‘Here they shot,\r\nand Salisbury falls downe’. After an _Exeunt_ which clears the stage,\r\nthere is fighting in the open, during which a French relieving party\r\n‘enter the Towne with souldiers’, and later ‘Enter on the Walls, Puzel,\r\nDolphin, Reigneir, Alanson, and Souldiers’. In II. i, which follows,\r\na French watch is set, lest English come ‘neere to the walles’. Then\r\n‘Enter Talbot, Bedford, and Burgundy, with scaling Ladders’; Bedford\r\nwill go ‘to yond corner’, Burgundy ‘to this’, and Talbot mount ‘heere’.\r\nThey assault, and ‘The French leape ore the walles in their shirts.\r\nEnter seuerall wayes, Bastard, Alanson, Reignier, halfe ready, and\r\nhalfe unready’. They discourse and are pursued by the English, who\r\nthen ‘retreat’, and in turn discourse ‘here ... in the market-place’,\r\nrejoicing at how the French did ‘Leape o’re the Walls for refuge in\r\nthe field’. Then, after a clearance, comes a scene at the Countess\r\nof Auvergne’s castle. In III. ii the Pucell enters before the gates\r\nof Rouen, obtains access by a trick, and then ‘Enter Pucell on the\r\ntop, thrusting out a torch burning’. Other French watch without for\r\nthe signal from ‘yonder tower’ or ‘turret’, and then follow into the\r\ntown and expel the English, after which, ‘Enter Talbot and Burgonie\r\nwithout: within, Pucell, Charles, Bastard, and Reigneir on the walls’.\r\nAfter parley, ‘Exeunt from the walls’, and fighting in front leaves the\r\nEnglish victorious, and again able to enter the town. In IV. ii ‘Enter\r\nTalbot ... before Burdeaux’, summons the French general ‘vnto the\r\nWall’, and ‘Enter Generall aloft’. In V. iii the English are victorious\r\nbefore Angiers, sound for a parley before the castle, and ‘Enter\r\nReignier on the walles’. After parley, Reignier says ‘I descend’, and\r\nthen ‘Enter Reignier’ to welcome the English.\r\n\r\n[150] In _Looking-Glass_, II. i, ‘Enters Remilia’ and after discourse\r\nbids her ladies ‘Shut close these curtaines straight and shadow me’;\r\nwhereupon ‘They draw the Curtaines and Musicke plaies’. Then enter the\r\nMagi, and ‘The Magi with their rods beate the ground, and from vnder\r\nthe same riseth a braue Arbour’. Rasni enters and will ‘drawe neare\r\nRemilias royall tent’. Then ‘He drawes the Curtaines, and findes her\r\nstroken with thunder, blacke.’ She is borne out. Presumably the same\r\narbour is used in IV. iii, where Alvida’s ladies ‘enter the bowers’.\r\nBoth scenes are apparently near the palace at Nineveh and not in a\r\ncamp. The earlier action of _L. L. L._ is in a park, near a manor\r\nhouse, which is not necessarily represented. But at IV. iii. 373 the\r\nKing wishes to devise entertainment ‘in their tents’ for the ‘girls\r\nof France’, and Biron says, ‘First, from the park let us conduct them\r\nthither’. Presumably therefore V. ii passes near the tents.\r\n\r\n[151] _Looking-Glass_, II. i; IV. iii (_supra_); _Edw. III_, II. i.\r\n61, at Roxborough Castle, ‘Then in the sommer arber sit by me’; _2\r\nHen. IV_, V. iii (_infra_). In _Sp. Trag._ II. ii. 42, Horatio and\r\nBelimperia agree to meet in ‘thy father’s pleasant bower’. In II. iv\r\nthey enter with ‘let us to the bower’ and set an attendant to ‘watch\r\nwithout the gate’. While they sit ‘within these leauy bowers’ they\r\nare betrayed, and (s.d.) ‘They hang him in the Arbor’. In II. v (not\r\nreally a new scene) Hieronimo emerges from his house, where a woman’s\r\ncry ‘within this garden’ has plucked him from his ‘naked bed’, finds\r\nHoratio hanging ‘in my bower’, and (s.d.) ‘He cuts him downe’. In III.\r\nxii (an addition of the 1602 text) Hieronimo ranges ‘this hidious\r\norchard’, where Horatio was murdered before ‘this the very tree’.\r\nFinally, in IV. ii Isabella enters ‘this garden plot’, and (s.d.) ‘She\r\ncuts downe the Arbour’.\r\n\r\n[152] _Sp. Trag._ III. xii^a (_supra_); _Shoemaker’s Holiday_, sc. ii,\r\n‘this flowry banke’, sc. iv, ‘these meddowes’; _1 Hen. VI_, II. iv,\r\n‘From off this brier pluck a white rose with me’, &c. In _R. J._ II.\r\ni (Q_{1}, but Q_{2} has apparently the same setting) Romeo enters,\r\nfollowed by friends, who say, ‘He came this way, and leapt this orchard\r\nwall’, and refer to ‘those trees’. They go, and in II. ii (presumably\r\nthe same scene) Romeo speaks under Juliet’s window ‘ouer my head’.\r\nShe says ‘The Orchard walles are high and hard to climb’, and he, ‘By\r\nloues light winges did I oreperch these wals’, and later swears by the\r\nblessed moon, ‘That tips with siluer all these fruit trees tops’.\r\n\r\n[153] _R. J._ II. ii (_supra_); _Sp. Trag._ II. v (_supra_); _Look\r\nAbout You_, sc. v (a bowling green under Gloucester’s chamber in the\r\nFleet); _1 Oldcastle_, I. iii, II. i (a grove before Cobham’s gate and\r\nan inn); &c. In _1 Contention_, sc. ii. 64, Elinor sends for a conjurer\r\nto do a spell ‘on the backside of my orchard heere’. In sc. iv she\r\nenters with the conjurer, says ‘I will stand upon this Tower here’,\r\nand (s.d.) ‘She goes vp to the Tower’. Then the conjurer will ‘frame a\r\ncirkle here vpon the earth’. A spirit ascends; spies enter; and ‘Exet\r\nElnor aboue’. York calls ‘Who’s within there?’ The setting of _2 Hen.\r\nVI_, I. ii, is much the same, except that the references to the tower\r\nare replaced by the s.d. ‘Enter Elianor aloft’. In _2 Hen. VI_, II.\r\nii, the scene is ‘this close walke’ at the Duke of York’s. Similarly,\r\nscc. i, iv of _Humourous Day’s Mirth_ are before Labervele’s house in\r\na ‘green’, which is his wife’s ‘close walk’, which is kept locked, and\r\ninto which a visitor intrudes. But in sc. vii, also before Labervele’s,\r\nthe ‘close walk’ is referred to as distinct from the place of the scene.\r\n\r\n[154] _2 Troublesome Raigne_, sc. viii, ‘Enter two Friars laying a\r\nCloth’. One says, ‘I meruaile why they dine heere in the Orchard’. We\r\nneed not marvel; it was to avoid interior action. In _2 Hen. IV_, V.\r\niii, the scene is Shallow’s orchard, ‘where, in an arbour, we will eat\r\na last year’s pippin of mine own graffing, with a dish of caraways, and\r\nso forth’.\r\n\r\n[155] _Famous Victories_, sc. ii, 5, ‘we will watch here at\r\nBillingsgate ward’; _Jack Straw_, iii (Smithfield); _W. for Fair\r\nWomen_, II. 115, ‘here at a friends of mine in Lumberd Street’; IV.\r\n1511, ‘Enter two Carpenters vnder Newgate’; _Shoemaker’s Holiday_, sc.\r\nxi (Tower Street, _vide infra_); _Cromwell_, V. ii, iii (Westminster\r\nand Lambeth, _vide infra_); _Arden of F._ II. ii (Paul’s Churchyard,\r\n_vide infra_); _2 Hen. VI_, IV. vi, ‘Enter Iacke Cade and the rest, and\r\nstrikes his staffe on London stone’; &c.\r\n\r\n[156] _Span. Tragedy_, III. vi. 104, ‘He turnes him off’ (s.d.); _Sir\r\nT. More_, sc. xvii. More is brought in by the Lieutenant of the Tower\r\nand delivered to the sheriff. He says (1911), ‘Oh, is this the place?\r\nI promise ye it is a goodly scaffolde’, and ‘your stayre is somewhat\r\nweake’. Lords enter ‘As he is going vp the stayres’ (s.d.), and he\r\njests with ‘this straunge woodden horsse’ and ‘Truely heers a moste\r\nsweet Gallerie’ (where the marginal s.d. is ‘walking’). Apparently the\r\nblock is not visible; he is told it is ‘to the Easte side’ and ‘exit’\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\n[157] _Rich. II_, I. iii, ‘The trumpets sound and the King enters with\r\nhis nobles; when they are set, enter the Duke of Norfolke in armes\r\ndefendent’. No one is ‘to touch the listes’ (43), and when the duel is\r\nstopped the combatants’ returne backe to their chaires againe’ (120).\r\n\r\n[158] _S. and P._ I. iii. There is an open place in Rhodes which a mule\r\nand ass can enter. Knights and ladies are welcomed and go ‘forwards to\r\nthe tilt’ with an ‘Exeunt’ (126). Action continues in the same place.\r\nPiston bids Basilisco ‘stay with me and looke vpon the tilters’, and\r\n‘Will you vp the ladder, sir, and see the tilting?’ The s.d. follows\r\n(180), ‘Then they go vp the ladders and they sound within to the first\r\ncourse’. Piston and Basilisco then describe the courses as these\r\nproceed, evidently out of sight of the audience. The tiltyard may be\r\nsupposed to run like that at Westminster, parallel to the public road\r\nand divided from it by a wall, up which ladders can be placed for the\r\ncommoner spectators. In V. ii Erastus is arrested in public and tried\r\non the spot before the Marshal. He is bound to ‘that post’ (83) and\r\nstrangled. The witnesses are to be killed. Soliman says (118),\r\n\r\n    Lord Marshall, hale them to the towers top.\r\n    And throw them headlong downe into the valley;\r\n\r\nand we get the s.ds. ‘Then the Marshall beares them to the tower top’\r\n(122), and ‘Then they are both tumbled downe’ (130). Presumably they\r\ndisappear behind.\r\n\r\n[159] _James IV_, I. ii. 1, ‘Enter _Slipper_, _Nano_, and _Andrew_,\r\nwith their billes, readie written, in their hands’. They dispute as to\r\nwhose bill shall stand highest, and then post the bills.\r\n\r\n[160] _Lord Cromwell_, III. i. 41 (in Italy):\r\n\r\n    Content thee, man; here set vp these two billes,\r\n    And let us keep our standing on the bridge,\r\n\r\nfollowed by s.ds., ‘One standes at one end, and one at tother’, and\r\n‘Enter Friskiball, the Marchant, and reades the billes’. In V. ii. 1\r\n(Westminster) Cromwell says, ‘Is the Barge readie?’ and (12) ‘Set on\r\nbefore there, and away to Lambeth’. After an ‘Exeunt’, V. iii begins\r\n‘Halberts, stand close vnto the water-side’, and (16) ‘Enter Cromwell’.\r\n\r\n[161] Cf. ch. xix, p. 44. _Wounds of Civil War_ has several such\r\nscenes. In I. i. 1, ‘Enter on the Capitoll Sulpitius Tribune ...\r\nwhom placed, and their Lictors before them with their Rods and Axes,\r\nSulpitius beginneth’ ... (146) ‘Here enter Scilla with Captaines and\r\nSouldiers’. Scilla’s party are not in the Capitol; they ‘braue the\r\nCapitoll’ (149), are ‘before the Capitoll’ (218), but Scilla talks to\r\nthe senators, and Marius trusts to see Scilla’s head ‘on highest top of\r\nall this Capitoll’. Presently Scilla bids (249) ‘all that loue Scilla\r\ncome downe to him’, and (258) ‘Here let them goe downe’. In II. i the\r\naction is in the open, but (417) ‘yond Capitoll’ is named; III. i seems\r\nto be in ‘this Capitoll’ (841). In IV. i Marius and his troops enter\r\nbefore the seated Senate. Octavius, the consul, ‘sits commanding in\r\nhis throne’ (1390). From Marius’ company, ‘Cynna presseth vp’ (s.d.)\r\nto ‘yonder emptie seate’ (1408), and presently Marius is called up and\r\n(1484) ‘He takes his seate’. In V. v. 2231 ‘Scilla seated in his roabes\r\nof state is saluted by the Citizens’. Similarly in _T. A._ I. i, ‘Enter\r\nthe Tribunes and Senatours aloft: and then enter Saturninus and his\r\nfollowers at one doore, and Bassianus and his followers’. Saturninus\r\nbids the tribunes ‘open the gates and let me in’ (63) and ‘They goe vp\r\ninto the Senate house’. Titus enters and buries his sons in his family\r\ntomb, and (299) ‘Enter aloft the Emperour’ and speaks to Titus. There\r\nis a Venetian senate house in _K. to K. an Honest Man_, scc. iii, xvii,\r\nbut I do not find a similar interplay with the outside citizens here.\r\n\r\n[162] _W. for Fair Women_, II. 93 (Lombard Street), ‘While Master\r\nSanders and he are in busy talk one to the other, Browne steps to a\r\ncorner.... Enter a Gentleman with a man with a torch before. Browne\r\ndraws to strike’; _Arden of F._ II. ii. 41, ‘Stand close, and take you\r\nfittest standing, And at his comming foorth speed him’.\r\n\r\n[163] _T. G._ IV. ii (cf. IV. iii. 16, ‘Now must we to her window’, and\r\nIII. i. 35, 114, where Valentine has a rope-ladder to scale Silvia’s\r\nwindow ‘in an upper tower’ and ‘aloft, far from the ground’); IV. iv.\r\n91, ‘That’s her chamber’; _R. J._ (orchard scenes), II. ii; III. v,\r\n‘Enter Romeo and Juliet at the window’ (Q_{1} where Q_{2} has ‘aloft’;\r\non the difficulty presented by Juliet’s chamber, cf. p. 94); _M.

Women_, 1495, ‘Enter Mall in the window’;\r\n_Sp. Trag._ II. ii, where spies ‘in secret’ and ‘aboue’ overhear the\r\nloves of Horatio and Belimperia below. Lovers are not concerned in\r\n_Sp. Trag._ III. ii, ‘Enter Hieronimo ... A Letter falleth’; III. ix,\r\n‘Belimperia, at a window’; _The Shrew_, V. i. 17, ‘Pedant lookes out of\r\nthe window’.\r\n\r\n[164] In _T. A._ I. i a coffin is brought in, apparently in the\r\nmarket-place, while the Senators are visible in the Capitol (cf. p.\r\n58, n. 2), and (90) ‘They open the Tombe’ and (150) ‘Sound trumpets,\r\nand lay the coffin in the Tombe’. _R. J._ V. iii is in a churchyard\r\nwith ‘yond yew trees’ (3). A torch ‘burneth in the Capels monument’\r\n(127), also called a ‘vault’ (86, &c.) and ‘the tomb’ (262). Romeo will\r\n‘descend into this bed of death’ (28), and Q_{1} adds the s.d. ‘Romeo\r\nopens the tombe’ (45). He kills Paris, whose blood ‘stains The stony\r\nentrance of this sepulchre’ (141). Juliet awakes and speaks, and must\r\nof course be visible. The Admiral’s inventories of 1598 (_Henslowe\r\nPapers_, 116) include ‘j tombe’, ‘j tome of Guido, j tome of Dido’.\r\n\r\n[165] _George a Greene_, sc. xi, ‘Enter a Shoemaker sitting vpon the\r\nStage at worke’, where a shop is not essential; but may be implied\r\nby ‘Stay till I lay in my tooles’ (1005); _Locrine_, II. ii, ‘Enter\r\nStrumbo, Dorothy, Trompart cobling shooes and singing’ (569) ... ‘Come\r\nsirrha shut vp’ (660); _R. and J._ V. i. 55, ‘This should be the house.\r\nBeing holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!’ where\r\nthe elaborate description of the shop which precedes leaves some doubt\r\nhow far it was represented; _Shoemaker’s Holiday_, scc. iii, ‘Open my\r\nshop windows’; v, ‘Ile goe in’; viii, ‘Shut vp the shop’; xi, ‘Enter\r\nHodge at his shop-board, Rafe, Friske, Hans, and a boy at worke’ (all\r\nbefore or in Eyre’s shop); x, ‘Enter Iane in a Semsters shop working,\r\nand Hammon muffled at another doore, he stands aloofe’ (another shop);\r\n_1 Edw.

Enter the\r\nKing disguised’.\r\n\r\n[166] _Arden of F._ II. ii. 52,\r\n\r\n‘_Here enters_ a prentise.\r\n\r\n    Tis very late; I were best shute vp my stall,\r\n    For heere will be ould filching, when the presse\r\n    Comes foorth of Paules.\r\n\r\n_Then lettes he downe his window, and it breaks_ Black Wils _head_’.\r\n\r\n[167] _Shoemaker’s Holiday_, sc. xi, ‘the signe of the Last in\r\nTower-street, mas yonders the house’; _1 Edw. IV_, IV. iii, ‘Heres\r\nLombard Streete, and heres the Pelican’. The Admiral’s inventories of\r\n1598 (_Henslowe Papers_, 117) include ‘j syne for Mother Redcap’.\r\n\r\n[168] Cf. ch. xix, p. 11. The introduction of a meal goes rather beyond\r\nthe neo-classic analogy, but presents no great difficulty. If a banquet\r\ncan be brought into a garden or orchard, it can be brought into a porch\r\nor courtyard. It is not always possible to determine whether a meal\r\nis in a threshold scene or a hall scene (cf. p. 64), but in _1 Edw.\r\nIV_, III. ii, ‘Enter Nell and Dudgeon, with a table couered’ is pretty\r\nclearly at the door of the Tanner’s cottage.\r\n\r\n[169] In the theatre usage personages go ‘in’, even where they merely\r\ngo ‘off’ without entering a house (cf. e.g. p. 53, n. 2). The interlude\r\nusage is less regular, and sometimes personages go ‘out’, as they would\r\nappear to the audience to do.\r\n\r\n[170] _Soliman and Perseda_, II. i. 227, ‘Sound vp the Drum to Lucinaes\r\ndoore’ (s.d.). Doors are conspicuous in _K. to K. Honest Man_; thus sc.\r\nii. 82, ‘Enter Lelio with his sword drawen, hee knockes at his doore’;\r\nsc. v. 395, ’tis time to knocke vp Lelios householde traine. _He\r\nknockes_’ ... ‘What mean this troup of armed men about my dore?’; sc.\r\nv. 519 (Bristeo’s), ‘Come breake vp the doore’; sc. vii. 662, ‘_Enter\r\nAnnetta and Lucida with their worke in their handes...._ Here let vs\r\nsit awhile’ ... (738) ‘Get you in ... _Here put them in at doore_’; sc.\r\nvii. 894 (Lelio’s), ‘Underneath this wall, watch all this night: If\r\nany man shall attempt to breake your sisters doore, Be stout, assaile\r\nhim’; sc. vii. 828 (a Senator’s), ‘What make you lingering here about\r\nmy doores?’; sc. ix. 1034 (Lelio’s), ‘Heaue me the doores from of the\r\nhinges straight’; sc. xv. 1385 (Lelio’s), ‘my door doth ope’ (cf. p.\r\n62, on the courtyard scene in the same play).\r\n\r\n[171] Thus _Humorous Day’s Mirth_, sc. v (Moren’s), 111, ‘We’ll draw\r\nthee out of the house by the heels’ ... 143, ‘Thrust this ass out of\r\nthe doors’ ... 188, ‘Get you out of my house!’, but 190, ‘Well, come\r\nin, sweet bird’; _Shoemaker’s Holiday_, sc. xii (Lord Mayor’s), ‘Get\r\nyou in’, but ‘The Earl of Lincoln at the gate is newly lighted’.\r\n\r\n[172] _James IV_, II. i, ‘_Enter the Countesse of Arrain, with Ida,\r\nher daughter, in theyr porch, sitting at worke_’ ... (753) ‘Come, will\r\nit please you enter, gentle sir? _Offer to Exeunt_’; cf. _Arden of F._\r\n(_vide infra_) and the penthouse in _M. V._ II. vi. 1 (p. 58).\r\n\r\n[173] Perhaps the best example is in _Arden of Feversham_. Arden’s\r\nhouse at Aldersgate is described by Michael to the murderers in II. ii.\r\n189:\r\n\r\n    The dores Ile leaue unlockt against you come,\r\n    No sooner shall ye enter through the latch,\r\n    Ouer the thresholde to the inner court,\r\n    But on your left hand shall you see the staires\r\n    That leads directly to my M. Chamber.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is III. i. Arden and Francklin talk and go to bed. Michael,\r\nin remorse, alarms them with an outcry, and when they appear, explains\r\nthat he ‘fell asleepe, Vpon the thresholde leaning to the staires’ and\r\nhad a bad dream. Arden then finds that ‘the dores were all unlockt’.\r\nLater (III. iv. 8) Michael lies about this to the murderers:\r\n\r\n                  Francklin and my master\r\n    Were very late conferring in the porch,\r\n    And Francklin left his napkin where he sat\r\n    With certain gold knit in it, as he said.\r\n    Being in bed, he did bethinke himselfe,\r\n    And comming down he found the dores vnshut:\r\n    He lockt the gates, and brought away the keyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the murderers come in III. ii, Will bids Shakebag ‘show me to this\r\nhouse’, and Shakebag says ‘This is the doore; but soft, me thinks tis\r\nshut’. They are therefore at the outer door of the courtyard; cf. p.\r\n69, n. 2. Similarly _1 Rich. II_, III. ii, which begins with ‘Enter\r\nWoodstock, Lancaster, and Yorke, at Plashey’, and ‘heere at Plasshy\r\nhouse I’le bid you wellcome’, is clearly in a courtyard. A servant\r\nsays (114), ‘Ther’s a horseman at the gate.... He will not off an’s\r\nhorse-backe till the inner gate be open’. Gloucester bids ‘open the\r\ninner gate ... lett hime in’, and (s.d.) ‘Enter a spruce Courtier a\r\nhorse-backe’. It is also before the house, for the Courtier says,\r\n‘Is he within’, and ‘I’le in and speake with the duke’. Rather more\r\ndifficult is _Englishmen for my Money_, sc. iv, ‘Enter Pisaro’ with\r\nothers, and says, ‘Proud am I that my roofe containes such friends’\r\n(748), also ‘I would not haue you fall out in my house’ (895). He\r\nsends his daughters ‘in’ (827, 851), so must be in the porch, and a\r\n‘knock within’ (s.d.) and ‘Stirre and see who knocks!’ (796) suggest\r\na courtyard gate. But later in the play (cf. p. 58, n. 4) the street\r\nseems to be directly before the same house.\r\n\r\n[174] In _K. to K. Honest Man_, scc. x-xii (continuous scene at\r\nServio’s), Phillida is called ‘forth’ (1058) and bidden keep certain\r\nprisoners ‘in the vpper loft’. Presently she enters ‘with the keyes’\r\nand after the s.d. ‘Here open the doore’ calls them out and gives them\r\na signet to pass ‘the Porter of the gates’, which Servio (1143) calls\r\n‘my castell gates’. In _1 Hen. VI_, II. iii, the Countess of Auvergne,\r\nto entrap Talbot, bids her porter ‘bring the keyes to me’; presumably\r\nTalbot’s men are supposed to break in the gates at the s.d. ‘a Peale of\r\nOrdnance’. _Rich. III_, III. vii, is at Baynard’s Castle. Buckingham\r\nbids Gloucester (55) ‘get you vp to the leads’ to receive the Mayor,\r\nwho enters with citizens, and (95) ‘Enter Richard with two bishops a\r\nlofte’. Similarly in _Rich. II_, III. iii. 62, ‘Richard appeareth on\r\nthe walls’ of Flint Castle, and then comes down (178) to the ‘base\r\ncourt’. _B. Beggar of Alexandria_, sc. ii, is before the house of\r\nElimine’s father and ‘Enter Elimine above on the walls’. She is in a\r\n‘tower’ and comes down, but there is nothing to suggest a courtyard.\r\n\r\n[175] _1 Sir John Oldcastle_, IV. iv, v (a continuous scene), is partly\r\n‘neare vnto the entrance of the Tower’, beyond the porter’s lodge,\r\npartly in Oldcastle’s chamber there, with a ‘window that goes out into\r\nthe leads’; cf. p. 67.\r\n\r\n[176] _Famous Victories_, sc. vi, 60, ‘What a rapping keep you at the\r\nKings Court gate!’; _Jack Straw_, II. ii (a City gate).\r\n\r\n[177] _A Shrew_, ind. 1, ‘Enter a Tapster, beating out of his doores\r\nSlie Droonken’; _1 Oldcastle_, V. iii-vii (inn and barn); _True Tragedy\r\nof Rich. III_, sc. viii, ‘Earle Riuers speakes out of his chamber’ in\r\nan inn-yard, where he has been locked up; _James IV_, III. ii (stable);\r\n_Looking Glass_, V. ii. 2037, ‘Enter the temple Omnes’. _Selimus_, sc.\r\nxxi. 2019, has\r\n\r\n    Thy bodie in this auntient monument,\r\n    Where our great predecessours sleep in rest:\r\n               Suppose the Temple of _Mahomet_,\r\n    Thy wofull son _Selimus_ thus doth place.\r\n\r\nIs the third line really a s.d., in which case it does not suggest\r\nrealistic staging, or a misunderstood line of the speech, really meant\r\nto run, ‘Supposed the Temple of great Mahomet’?\r\n\r\n[178] _Patient Grissell_, 755–1652, reads like a threshold scene, and\r\n‘Get you in!’ is repeated (848, 1065, 1481), but Grissell’s russet\r\ngown and pitcher are hung up and several times referred to (817, 828,\r\n1018, 1582). _Old Fortunatus_, 733–855, at the palace of Babylon, must\r\nbe a threshold scene as the Soldan points to ‘yon towre’ (769), but\r\nthis is not inconsistent with the revealing of a casket, with the s.d.\r\n(799) ‘Draw a Curtaine’. We need not therefore assume that _M. V._ II.\r\nvii, ix, in which Portia bids ‘Draw aside the Curtaines’ and ‘Draw the\r\nCurtain’, or III. ii are hall scenes, and all the Belmont scenes may\r\nbe, like V. i, in a garden backed by a portico; or rather the hall\r\nreferred to in V. i. 89, ‘That light we see is burning in my hall’, may\r\ntake the form of a portico.\r\n\r\n[179] Cf. p. 58, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[180] Thus in _Rich. II_, V. iii, iv (a continuous scene), Aumerle has\r\nleave to ‘turne the key’ (36). Then ‘_The Duke of Yorke knokes at the\r\ndoore and crieth_, My leige ... Thou hast a traitor in thy presence\r\nthere’. Cf. _1 Troublesome Raigne_, sc. xiii. 81:\r\n\r\n    He stayes my Lord but at the Presence door:\r\n    Pleaseth your Highnes, I will call him in.\r\n\r\n[181] _Famous Victories_, scc. iv, v (a continuous scene), ‘Jayler,\r\nbring the prisoner to the barre’ (iv. 1).... ‘Thou shalt be my Lord\r\nchiefe Justice, and thou shalt sit in the chaire’ (v. 10); _Sir\r\nT.

V._ IV. i; _1 Sir John\r\nOldcastle_, V. x; &c.\r\n\r\n[182] _Bacon and Bungay_, scc. vii, ix (Regent House), where visitors\r\n‘sit to heare and see this strange dispute’ (1207), and later, ‘Enter\r\nMiles, with a cloth and trenchers and salt’ (1295); _Shoemaker’s\r\nHoliday_, sc. xv (Leadenhall); _Englishmen for my Money_, sc. iii\r\n(Exchange).\r\n\r\n[183] _1 Troublesome Raigne_, sc. xi, in a convent, entails the opening\r\nof a coffer large enough to hold a nun and a press large enough to\r\nhold a priest; _2 Troublesome Raigne_, sc. iii, before St. Edmund’s\r\nshrine, has a numerous company who swear on an altar. _Alphonsus_, IV.\r\ni, begins ‘Let there be a brazen Head set in the middle of the place\r\nbehind the Stage, out of the which cast flames of fire’. It is in the\r\n‘sacred seate’ of Mahomet, who speaks from the head, and bids the\r\npriests ‘call in’ visitors ‘which now are drawing to my Temple ward’.\r\n\r\n[184] _T. of a Shrew_, scc. ix, xi, xiii; _Sir T. More_, scc. ix,\r\n‘Enter S^r _Thomas Moore_, M^r _Roper_, and Seruing men setting\r\nstooles’; xiii, ‘Enter ... Moore ... as in his house at Chelsey’ ...\r\n(1413) ‘Sit good Madame [_in margin_, ‘lowe stooles’] ... (1521)\r\n‘Entreate their Lordships come into the hall’. _E. M. I._ III. i, ii\r\n(a continuous scene), is at Thorello’s house, and in III. iii. 1592\r\nit is described with ‘I saw no body to be kist, vnlesse they would\r\nhaue kist the post, in the middle of the warehouse; for there I left\r\nthem all ... How? were they not gone in then?’ But I. iv. 570, also at\r\nThorello’s, has ‘Within sir, in the warehouse’. Probably the warehouse\r\nwas represented as an open portico.\r\n\r\n[185] Cf. p. 63, nn. 3, 4.\r\n\r\n[186] _Sir T.

IV_, IV. iv, v (a continuous scene divided,\r\nwith unanimity in ill-doing, by modern editors in the middle of a\r\nspeech), the King says (IV. iv. 131), ‘Beare me hence Into some other\r\nchamber’, Warwick (IV. v. 4), ‘Call for the Musick in the other\r\nRoome’, and the King ‘Set me the Crowne vpon my Pillow here’. The\r\nPrince enters and the Lords go to ‘the other roome’; he takes the\r\ncrown and ‘Exit’. Later (56) the Lords say, ‘This doore is open,\r\nhe is gone this way’, and ‘He came not through the chamber where we\r\nstaide’. The Prince returns and the Lords are bidden ‘Depart the\r\nchamber’. Later (233) the King asks the name of ‘the lodging where\r\nI first did swound’, and bids ‘beare me to that Chamber’. Then the\r\nscene, and in F_{1} the act, ends. In _1 Contention_, sc. x. 1, ‘Then\r\nthe Curtaines being drawne, Duke _Humphrey_ is discouered in his bed,\r\nand two men lying on his brest and smothering him in his bed. And then\r\nenter the Duke of _Suffolke_ to them’. He bids ‘draw the Curtaines\r\nagaine and get you gone’. The King enters and bids him call Gloucester.\r\nHe goes out, and returns to say that Gloucester is dead. Warwick says,\r\n‘Enter his priuie chamber my Lord and view the bodie’, and (50),\r\n‘_Warwicke_ drawes the curtaines and showes Duke _Humphrey_ in his\r\nbed’. The analogous _2 Hen. VI_, III. ii, omits the murder _coram\r\npopulo_ and begins ‘Enter two or three running ouer the Stage, from\r\nthe Murther of Duke Humfrey’. It then follows the earlier model until\r\n(132) the King bids Warwick ‘Enter his Chamber’ and we get the brief\r\ns.d. (146) ‘Bed put forth’, and Warwick speaks again. The next scene\r\nis another death scene, which begins in _1 Contention_, sc. xi, ‘Enter\r\nKing and _Salsbury_, and then the Curtaines be drawne, and the Cardinal\r\nis discouered in his bed, rauing and staring as if he were madde’,\r\nand in _2 Hen. VI_, III. iii, ‘Enter the King ... to the Cardinal in\r\nbed’, ending (32) ‘Close vp his eyes, and draw the Curtaine close’. In\r\n_1 Rich. II_, V. i, Lapoole enters ‘with a light’ and murderers, whom\r\nhe bids ‘stay in the next with-draweing chamber ther’. Then (48), ‘He\r\ndrawes the curtayne’, says of Gloucester ‘He sleepes vppon his bed’,\r\nand Exit. Gloucester, awaked by ghosts, says (110), ‘The doores are all\r\nmade fast ... and nothing heere appeeres, But the vast circute of this\r\nemptie roome’. Lapoole, returning, says, ‘Hee’s ryssen from his bed’.\r\nGloucester bids him ‘shutt to the doores’ and ‘sits to wright’. The\r\nmurderers enter and kill him. Lapoole bids ‘lay hime in his bed’ and\r\n‘shutt the doore, as if he ther had dyd’, and they (247) ‘Exeunt with\r\nthe bodye’. In _Death of R. Hood_, ii, ind., the presenter says ‘Draw\r\nbut that vaile, And there King John sits sleeping in his chaire’, and\r\nthe s.d. follows, ‘Drawe the curten: the King sits sleeping ... Enter\r\nQueene ... She ascends, and seeing no motion, she fetcheth her children\r\none by one; but seeing yet no motion, she descendeth, wringing her\r\nhands, and departeth’. In _R. J._ IV. iii, iv, v (continuous action),\r\nJuliet drinks her potion and Q_{1}, has the s.d. (IV. iii. 58) ‘She\r\nfals vpon her bed within the Curtaines’. Action follows before the\r\nhouse, until the Nurse, bidden to call Juliet, finds her dead. Then\r\nsuccessively ‘Enter’ Lady Capulet, Capulet, the Friar, and Paris, to\r\nall of whom Juliet is visible. After lament, the Friar, in Q_{2} (IV.\r\nv. 91), bids them all ‘go you in’, but in Q_{1}, ‘They all but the\r\nNurse goe foorth, casting Rosemary on her and shutting the Curtens’.\r\nThe Nurse, then, in both texts, addresses the musicians, who came with\r\nParis. On the difficulty of this scene, in relation to II. ii and III.\r\nv, cf. p. 94.\r\n\r\n[191] _Wounds of Civil War_, III. ii, 913, ‘Enter old _Marius_ with\r\nhis keeper, and two souldiers’. There is (965) ‘this homely bed’, on\r\nwhich (972) ‘He lies downe’ (s.d.), and when freed (1066) ‘from walls\r\nto woods I wend’. In _Edw. II_, 2448–2568 (at Kenilworth), keepers\r\nsay that the King is ‘in a vault vp to the knees in water’, of which\r\n(2455) ‘I opened but the doore’. Then (2474) ‘Heere is the keyes, this\r\nis the lake’ and (2486), ‘Heeres a light to go into the dungeon’. Then\r\n(2490) Edward speaks and, presumably having been brought out, is bid\r\n(2520) ‘lie on this bed’. He is murdered with a table and featherbed\r\nbrought from ‘the next roome’ (2478), and the body borne out. In _1\r\nTr. Raigne_, sc. xii, Hubert enters, bids his men (8) ‘stay within\r\nthat entry’ and when called set Arthur ‘in this chayre’. He then bids\r\nArthur (13) ‘take the benefice of the faire evening’, and ‘Enter\r\nArthur’ who is later (131) bid ‘Goe in with me’. _K. J._ IV. i has\r\nprecisely analogous indications, except that the attendants stand\r\n(2) ‘within the arras’, until Hubert stamps ‘Vpon the bosome of the\r\nground’. In _Rich. III_, I. iv, Clarence talks with his keeper, and\r\nsleeps. Murderers enter, to whom the keeper says (97), ‘Here are the\r\nkeies, there sits the Duke a sleepe’. They stab him, threaten to ‘chop\r\nhim in the malmsey but in the next roome’ (161, 277), and bear the body\r\nout. In _Rich. II_, V. v (at Pontefract) Richard muses on ‘this prison\r\nwhere I liue’. He is visited by a groom of his stable (70), ‘where no\r\nman neuer comes, but that sad dog, That brings me foode’. Then (95)\r\n‘Enter one to Richard with meate’ and (105) ‘The murderers rush in’,\r\nand (119) the bodies are cleared away. _Sir T. More_, sc. xvi, ‘Enter\r\n_Sir Thomas Moore_, the Lieutenant, and a seruant attending as in his\r\nchamber in the Tower’; _Lord Cromwell_, V. v, ‘Enter Cromwell in the\r\nTower.... Enter the Lieutenant of the Tower and officers.... Enter all\r\nthe Nobles’; _Dead Man’s Fortune_, plot (_Henslowe Papers_, 134), ‘Here\r\nthe laydes speakes in prysoun’; _Death of R. Hood_, IV. i:\r\n\r\n    _Brand._ Come, come, here is the door.\r\n    _Lady Bruce._ O God, how dark it is.\r\n    _Brand._ Go in, go in; it’s higher up the stairs....\r\n                                           _He seems to lock a door._\r\n\r\nIn _Old Fortunatus_, 2572, Montrose says of Ampedo, ‘Drag him to\r\nyonder towre, there shackle him’. Later (2608) Andelocia is brought to\r\njoin him in ‘this prison’ and the attendants bid ‘lift in his legs’.\r\nThe brothers converse in ‘fetters’. In _1 Oldcastle_, IV. iv, v (a\r\ncontinuous scene), ‘Enter the Bishop of Rochester with his men, in\r\nliuerie coates’. They have brought him ‘heere into the Tower’ (1965)\r\nand may ‘go backe vnto the Porters Lodge’ or attend him ‘here without’.\r\nBut they slip away. The Bishop calls the Lieutenant and demands to\r\nsee Oldcastle. A message is sent to Oldcastle by Harpoole. Then\r\n(1995), ‘Enter sir Iohn Oldcastle’, and while the Bishop dismisses the\r\nLieutenant, Harpoole communicates a plot ‘aside’ to Oldcastle. Then the\r\nBishop addresses Oldcastle, and as they talk Oldcastle and Harpoole lay\r\nhands upon him. They take his upper garments, which Oldcastle puts on.\r\nHarpoole says (2016) ‘the window that goes out into the leads is sure\r\nenough’ and he will ‘conuay him after, and bind him surely in the inner\r\nroom’. Then (2023) ‘Enter seruing men againe’. Oldcastle, disguised as\r\nthe Bishop, comes towards them, saying, ‘The inner roomes be very hot\r\nand close’. Harpoole tells him that he will ‘downe vpon them’. He then\r\npretends to attack him. The serving-men join in, and (2049) ‘Sir John\r\nescapes’. The Lieutenant enters and asks who is brawling ‘so neare vnto\r\nthe entrance of the Tower’. Then (2057) ‘Rochester calls within’, and\r\nas they go in and bring him out bound, Harpoole gets away; cf. p. 62,\r\nn. 2. _Look About You_, sc. v, is a similar scene in the Fleet, partly\r\nin Gloucester’s chamber (811), the door of which can be shut, partly\r\n(865) on a bowling green. Analogous to some of the prison scenes is\r\n_Alarum for London_, sc. xii, in which a Burgher’s Wife shows Van End a\r\nvault where her wealth is hid, and (1310) ‘She pushes him downe’, and\r\nhe is stoned there.\r\n\r\n[192] _Bacon and Bungay_, I. ii. 172, ‘Enter frier _Bacon_’, with\r\nothers, says ‘Why flocke you thus to Bacon’s secret cell?’, and\r\nconjures; II. ii is in a street, but Bacon says (603) ‘weele to my\r\nstudie straight’, and II. iii begins (616), ‘_Bacon_ and _Edward_\r\ngoes into the study’, where Edward *sits and looks in ‘this glasse\r\nprospectiue’ (620), but his vision is represented on some part of the\r\nstage; in IV. i. 1530, ‘Enter Frier _Bacon_ drawing the courtaines,\r\nwith a white sticke, a booke in his hand, and a lampe lighted by him,\r\nand the brazen head and _Miles_, with weapons by him’. Miles is bid\r\nwatch the head, and ‘Draw closse the courtaines’ and ‘Here he [Bacon]\r\nfalleth asleepe’ (1568). Miles ‘will set me downe by a post’ (1577).\r\nPresently (1604), ‘Heere the Head speakes and a lightning flasheth\r\nforth, and a hand appeares that breaketh down the Head with a hammer’.\r\nMiles calls to Bacon (1607) ‘Out of your bed’; IV. iii. 1744 begins\r\n‘Enter frier _Bacon_ with frier _Bungay_ to his cell’. A woodcut in\r\nQ_{2} of 1630, after the revival by the Palsgrave’s men, seems to\r\nillustrate II. iii; the back wall has a window to the left and the head\r\non a bracket in the centre; before it is the glass on a table, with\r\nEdward gazing in it; Bacon sits to the right. Miles stands to the left;\r\nno side-walls are visible. In _Locrine_, I. iii. 309, ‘Enter Strumbo\r\naboue in a gowne, with inke and paper in his hand’; _Dr. Faustus_, ind.\r\n28, ‘And this the man that in his study sits’, followed by s.d. ‘Enter\r\nFaustus in his Study’, 433, ‘Enter Faustus in his Study ... (514)\r\nEnter [Mephastophilis] with diuels, giuing crownes and rich apparell\r\nto Faustus, and daunce, and then depart’, with probably other scenes.\r\nIn _T. A._ V. ii. 1, ‘Enter Tamora, and her two sonnes disguised’ ...\r\n(9) ‘They knocke and Titus opens his studie doore’. Tamora twice (33,\r\n43) bids him ‘come downe’, and (80) says, ‘See heere he comes’. The\r\nkilling of Tamora’s sons follows, after which Titus bids (205) ‘bring\r\nthem in’. In _Sir T. More_, sc. viii. 735, ‘A table beeing couered\r\nwith a greene Carpet, a state Cushion on it, and the Pursse and Mace\r\nlying thereon Enter Sir Thomas Moore’.... (765) ‘Enter Surrey, Erasmus\r\nand attendants’. Erasmus says (779), ‘Is yond Sir Thomas?’ and Surrey\r\n(784), ‘That Studie is the generall watche of England’. The original\r\ntext is imperfect, but in the revision Erasmus is bid ‘sitt’, and later\r\nMore bids him ‘in’ (ed. Greg, pp. 84, 86). _Lord Cromwell_ has three\r\nstudies; in II. i, ii (continuous action at Antwerp), ‘Cromwell in his\r\nstudy with bagges of money before him casting of account’, while Bagot\r\nenters in front, soliloquizes, and then (II. ii. 23) with ‘See where he\r\nis’ addresses Cromwell; in III. ii (Bologna), the action begins as a\r\nhall scene, for (15) ‘They haue begirt you round about the house’ and\r\n(47) ‘Cromwell shuts the dore’ (s.d.), but there is an inner room, for\r\n(115) ‘Hodge [disguised as the Earl of Bedford] sits in the study, and\r\nCromwell calls in the States’, and (126) ‘Goe draw the curtaines, let\r\nvs see the Earle’; in IV. v (London), ‘Enter Gardiner in his studie,\r\nand his man’. _E. M. I._ I. iii, is before Cob’s house, and Tib is bid\r\nshow Matheo ‘vp to Signior Bobadilla’ (Q_{1} 392). In I. iv ‘Bobadilla\r\ndiscouers himselfe on a bench; to him, Tib’. She announces ‘a gentleman\r\nbelow’; Matheo is bid ‘come vp’, enters from ‘within’, and admires the\r\n‘lodging’. In _1 Oldcastle_, V. i. 2086, ‘Enter Cambridge, Scroope,\r\nand Gray, as in a chamber, and set downe at a table, consulting about\r\ntheir treason: King Harry and Suffolke listning at the doore’ ...\r\n(2114) ‘They rise from the table, and the King steps in to them, with\r\nhis Lordes’. _Stukeley_, i. 121, begins with Old Stukeley leaving his\r\nhost’s door to visit his son. He says (149), ‘I’ll to the Temple to\r\nsee my son’, and presumably crosses the stage during his speech of\r\n171–86, which ends ‘But soft this is his chamber as I take it’. Then\r\n‘He knocks’, and after parley with a page, says, ‘Give me the key of\r\nhis study’ and ‘methinks the door stands open’, enters, criticizes the\r\ncontents of the study, emerges, and (237) *‘Old Stukeley goes again\r\nto the study’. Then (244) ‘Enter _Stukeley_ at the further end of the\r\nstage’ and joins his father. Finally the boy is bid (335) ‘lock the\r\ndoor’. In _Downfall of R. Hood_, ind., ‘Enter Sir John Eltham and\r\nknocke at Skeltons doore’. He says, ‘Howe, maister Skelton, what at\r\nstudie hard?’ and (s.d.) ‘Opens the doore’. In _2 Edw. IV_, IV. ii,\r\n‘Enter D. Shaw, pensiuely reading on his booke’. He is visited by a\r\nGhost, who gives him a task, and adds, ‘That done, return; and in thy\r\nstudy end Thy loathed life’.\r\n\r\n[193] _Old Fortunatus_, 1315–1860, is before or in the hall of a court;\r\nat 1701, ‘A curtaine being drawne, where Andelocia lies sleeping in\r\nAgripines lap’. In _Downfall of R. Hood_, ind., is a s.d. of a court\r\nscene, presumably in a hall, and ‘presently Ely ascends the chaire ...\r\nEnter Robert Earl of Huntingdon, leading Marian: ... they infolde each\r\nother, and sit downe within the curteines ... drawing the curteins,\r\nall (but the Prior) enter, and are kindely receiued by Robin Hood. The\r\ncurteins are again shut’.\r\n\r\n[194] _Jew of Malta_, i. 36, ‘Enter Barabas in his Counting-house, with\r\nheapes of gold before him’. Later his house is taken for a nunnery;\r\nhe has hid treasure (536) ‘underneath the plancke That runs along the\r\nvpper chamber floore’, and Abigail becomes a nun, and (658) throws\r\nthe treasure from ‘aboue’. He gets another house, and Pilia-Borza\r\ndescribes (iii. 1167) how ‘I chanc’d to cast mine eye vp to the Iewes\r\ncounting-house’, saw money-bags, and climbed up and stole by night.\r\n_Arden of Feversham_, I., III. v, IV. i, V. i are at Arden’s house at\r\nFeversham. From I. I should assume a porch before the house, where\r\nArden and his wife breakfast and (369) ‘Then she throwes down the broth\r\non the grounde’; cf. 55, ‘Call her foorth’, and 637, ‘Lets in’. It can\r\nhardly be a hall scene, as part of the continuous action is ‘neare’\r\nthe house (318) and at 245 we get ‘This is the painters [Clarke’s]\r\nhouse’, who is called out. There is no difficulty in III. v or IV. i;\r\ncf. III. v. 164, ‘let vs in’. But V. i, taken by itself, reads like a\r\nhall scene with a counting-house behind. Black Will and Shakebag are\r\nhidden in a ‘counting-house’, which has a ‘door’ and a ‘key’ (113, 145,\r\n153). A chair and stool are to be ready for Mosbie and Arden (130).\r\nAlice bids Michael (169) ‘Fetch in the tables, And when thou hast done,\r\nstand before the counting-house doore’, and (179) ‘When my husband\r\nis come in, lock the streete doore’. When Arden comes with Mosbie,\r\nthey are (229) ‘in my house’. They play at tables and the murderers\r\ncreep out and kill Arden, and (261), ‘Then they lay the body in the\r\nCounting-house’. Susan says (267), ‘The blood cleaueth to the ground’,\r\nand Mosbie bids (275) ‘strew rushes on it’. Presently, when guests\r\nhave come and gone, (342) ‘Then they open the counting-house doore\r\nand looke vppon Arden’, and (363) ‘Then they beare the body into the\r\nfields’. Francklin enters, having found the body, with rushes in its\r\nshoe, ‘Which argueth he was murthred in this roome’, and looking about\r\n‘this chamber’, they find blood ‘in the place where he was wont to sit’\r\n(411–15).\r\n\r\n[195] In _1 Hen. IV_, II. iv, Henry calls Poins (1) ‘out of that fat\r\nroome’ and bids him (32) ‘Stand in some by-roome’ while the Prince\r\ntalks to the Drawer. The Vintner (91) bids the Drawer look to guests\r\n‘within’, and says Falstaff is ‘at the doore’. He enters and later\r\ngoes out to dismiss a court messenger who is (317) ‘at doore’ and\r\nreturns. He has a chair and cushion (416). When the Sheriff comes,\r\nHenry bids Falstaff (549) ‘hide thee behind the Arras, the rest walke\r\nvp aboue’. Later (578) Falstaff is found ‘a sleepe behind the Arras’.\r\nThis looks like a hall scene, and with it III. iii, where Mrs. Quickly\r\nis miscalled (72) ‘in mine owne house’ and Falstaff says (112) ‘I fell\r\na sleepe here, behind the Arras’, is consistent. But in _2 Hen. IV_,\r\nII. iv, Falstaff and Doll come out of their supper room. The Drawer\r\nannounces (75) ‘Antient Pistol’s belowe’, and is bid (109) ‘call him\r\nvp’ and (202) ‘thrust him downe staires’. Later (381) ‘Peyto knockes\r\nat doore’; so does Bardolph (397), to announce that ‘a dozen captaines\r\nstay at doore’. This is clearly an upper parlour. In _Look About You_,\r\nscc. ix, x (continuous action), Gloucester, disguised as Faukenbridge,\r\nand a Pursuivant have stepped into the Salutation tavern (1470),\r\nand are in ‘the Bel, our roome next the Barre’ (1639), with a stool\r\n(1504) and fire (1520). But at 1525 the action shifts. Skink enters,\r\napparently in a room called the Crown, and asks whether Faukenbridge\r\nwas ‘below’ (1533). Presumably he descends, for (1578) he sends the\r\nsheriff’s party ‘vp them stayres’ to the Crown. This part of the\r\naction is before the inn, rather than in the Bell. _Humorous Day’s\r\nMirth_, scc. viii, x-xii, in Verone’s ordinary, with tables and a court\r\ncupboard, seems to be a hall scene; at viii. 254 ‘convey them into the\r\ninward parlour by the inward room’ does not entail any action within\r\nthe supposed inward room.\r\n\r\n[196] _W. for Fair Women_, II. 601. The scene does not itself prove\r\ninterior action, but cf. the later reference (800), ‘Was he so suted\r\nwhen you dranke with him, Here in the buttery’.\r\n\r\n[197] In _Jew of Malta_, V. 2316, Barabas has ‘made a dainty Gallery,\r\nThe floore whereof, this Cable being cut, Doth fall asunder; so that\r\nit doth sinke Into a deepe pit past recouery’, and at 2345 is s.d. ‘A\r\ncharge, the cable cut, A Caldron discouered’.\r\n\r\n[198] Cf. pp. 51, 53, 55–6, 58–9, 62.\r\n\r\n[199] A. E. Richards, _Studies in English Faust Literature: i. The\r\nEnglish Wagner Book of 1594_ (1907). The book was entered in S. R. on\r\n16 Nov. 1593 (Arber, ii. 640). A later edition of 1680 is reprinted as\r\n_The Second Report of Dr. John Faustus_ by W. J. Thoms, _Early Prose\r\nRomances_ (1828), iii. Richards gives the date of the first edition of\r\nthe German book by Fridericus Schotus of Toledo as 1593. An edition\r\nof 1714 is reprinted by J. Scheible, _Das Kloster_, iii. 1. This has\r\nnothing corresponding to the stage-play of the English version.\r\n\r\n[200] _1 Contention_, sc. i. 1 (court scene), sc. xx. 1 (garden scene);\r\n_Locrine_, III. vi. 1278 (battle scene); &c., &c.\r\n\r\n[201] _Henslowe Papers_, 130, ‘To them Pride, Gluttony Wrath and\r\nCouetousness at one dore, at an other dore Enuie, Sloth and Lechery’\r\n(l. 6) ... ‘Enter Ferrex ... with ... soldiers one way ... to them At\r\na nother dore, Porrex ... and soldiers’ (26) ... ‘Enter Queene, with 2\r\nCounsailors ... to them Ferrex and Porrex seuerall waies ... Gorboduk\r\nentreing in The midst between’ (30) ... ‘Enter Ferrex and Porrex\r\nseuerally’ (36). I suppose that, strictly, ‘seuerally’ might also mean\r\nsuccessively by the same door, and perhaps does mean this in _Isle of\r\nGulls_, ind. 1 (Blackfriars), ‘Enter seuerally 3 Gentlemen as to see a\r\nplay’.\r\n\r\n[202] e. g. _Alphonsus_, II. i. 1 (battle scene); _Selimus_, 2430\r\n(battle scene); _Locrine_, V. v. 2022, 2061 (battle scene); _Old\r\nFortunatus_, 2675 (threshold scene); &c., &c. Archer, 469, calculates\r\nthat of 43 examples (sixteenth and seventeenth century) taken at\r\nrandom, 11 use ‘one ... the other’, 21 ‘one ... an other’, and 11\r\n‘several’.\r\n\r\n[203] _Selimus_, 658, ‘at diuerse doores’; _Fair Em_, sc. ix, ‘at two\r\nsundry doors’; _James IV_, II. ii. 1, ‘one way ... another way’; _Look\r\nAbout You_, 464, ‘two waies’; _Weakest Goeth to the Wall_, 3, ‘one way\r\n... another way’; _Jew of Malta_, 230, ‘Enter Gouernor ... met by’.\r\nFurther variants are the seventeenth-century _Lear_ (Q_{1}), II. i. 1,\r\n‘meeting’, and _Custom of Country_, IV. iv, ‘at both doors’.\r\n\r\n[204] _1 Rich. II_, I. i, ‘at seuerall doores’.\r\n\r\n[205] _Fair Em_, sc. iv, ‘Enter Manvile ... Enter Valingford at\r\nanother door ...

I_{3}^{v}, ‘Enter at one\r\ndore ... at the other dore ... Enter in the middest’. Examples from\r\nseventeenth-century public theatres are _Four Prentices of London_,\r\nprol., ‘Enter three in blacke clokes, at three doores’; _Travels of\r\n3 English Brothers_, p. 90, ‘Enter three seuerall waies the three\r\nBrothers’; _Nobody and Somebody_, 1322, ‘Enter at one doore ... at\r\nanother doore ... at another doore’; _Silver Age_, V. ii, ‘Exeunt three\r\nwayes’. It may be accident that these are all plays of Queen Anne’s\r\nmen, at the Curtain or Red Bull. For the middle entrance in private\r\ntheatres, cf. p. 132.\r\n\r\n[206] _Downfall of R. Hood_, I. i (ind.), after Eltham has knocked\r\nat Skelton’s study door (cf. p. 69), ‘At euery doore all the players\r\nrunne out’; _Englishmen for my Money_, 393, ‘Enter Pisaro, Delion\r\nthe Frenchman, Vandalle the Dutchman, Aluaro the Italian, and other\r\nMarchants, at seuerall doores’; cf. the seventeenth-century _1 Honest\r\nWhore_, sc. xiii (Fortune), ‘Enter ... the Duke, Castruchio, Pioratto,\r\nand Sinezi from severall doores muffled’.\r\n\r\n[207] _Locrine_, IV. ii. 1460 (not an entry), ‘Locrine at one side of\r\nthe stage’; _Sir T.

Very elaborate are the s.ds. of _John a Kent_, III. i.\r\nThe scene is before a Castle. A speaker says, ‘See, he [John a Cumber]\r\nsets the Castell gate wide ope’. Then follows dialogue, interspersed\r\nwith the s.ds. ‘Musique whyle he opens the door’.... ‘From one end of\r\nthe Stage enter an antique ... Into the Castell ... Exit’.... ‘From\r\nthe other end of the Stage enter another Antique ... Exit into the\r\nCastell’.... ‘From under the Stage the third antique ... Exit into the\r\nCastell’.... ‘The fourth out of a tree, if possible it may be ... Exit\r\ninto the Castell’. Then John a Cumber ‘Exit into the Castell, and makes\r\nfast the dore’. John a Kent enters, and ‘He tryes the dore’. John a\r\nCumber and others enter ‘on the walles’ and later ‘They discend’. For\r\nan earlier example of ‘end’, cf. _Cobler’s Prophecy_ (p. 35, n. 1), and\r\nfor a later _The Dumb Knight_ (Whitefriars), i, iv. In _2 Return from\r\nParnassus_ (Univ. play), IV. i begins ‘Sir _Radericke_ and _Prodigo_,\r\nat one corner of the Stage, Recorder and _Amoretto_ at the other’.\r\n\r\n[208] Cf. p. 98.\r\n\r\n[209] _Soliman and Perseda_, I. iv. 47, ‘Enter _Basilisco_ riding of a\r\nmule’ ...

Lawrence, _Horses upon the Elizabethan\r\nStage_ (_T. L.

I\r\nthink some kind of ‘hobby’ more likely than a trained animal.

The Bastard casts up his eyes ‘to heauen’ (130) at the\r\nsight, and the moons are in ‘the skie’ (163), but the episode follows\r\nimmediately after the coronation which is certainly in ‘the presence’\r\n(81). Perhaps this is why in _K. J._, IV. ii. 181, the appearance of\r\nthe moons is only narrated.\r\n\r\n[222] The Admiral’s inventories of 1598 (_Henslowe Papers_, 117)\r\ninclude ‘the clothe of the Sone and Moone’.\r\n\r\n[223] _Alphonsus_, prol.

(1937), ‘Exit _Venus_; or if you can\r\nconueniently, let a chaire come down from the top of the Stage and draw\r\nher vp’. In _Old Fortunatus_, 840, Fortunatus, at the Soldan’s court,\r\ngets a magic hat, wishes he were in Cyprus, and ‘Exit’. The bystanders\r\nspeak of him as going ‘through the ayre’ and ‘through the clouds’.\r\nAngels descend from heaven to a tower in the _Wagner Book_ play (cf. p.\r\n72).\r\n\r\n[224] One of the 1616 additions to the text of _Dr. Faustus_ (sc. xiv)\r\nhas the s.d. ‘Musicke while the Throne descends’ before the vision of\r\nheaven, and ‘Hell is discouered’ before that of hell. On the other\r\nhand, in _Death of R. Hood_, ii, ind. (cf. p. 66), the king is in a\r\nchair behind a curtain, and the fact that the queen ‘ascends’ and\r\n‘descends’ may suggest that this chair is the ‘state’. However this\r\nmay be, I do not see how any space behind the curtain can have been\r\nhigh enough to allow any dignity to the elaborate states required by\r\nsome court scenes; cf. p. 64, n. 5. The throne imagined in the _Wagner\r\nBook_ (cf. p. 72) had 22 steps. Out-of-door scenes, in which the\r\n‘state’ appears to be used, are _Alphonsus_, II. i. 461 (battle scene),\r\n‘Alphonsus sit in the Chaire’ (s.d.); II. i (a crowning on the field);\r\n_Locrine_, IV. ii. 1490 (camp scene), ‘Let him go into his chaire’\r\n(s.d.); _Old Fortunatus_, sc. i. 72 (dream scene in wood), ‘Fortune\r\ntakes her Chaire, the Kings lying at her feete, shee treading on them\r\nas shee goes vp’ ...

Chamber scenes are\r\nIII. i, ii, iii; IV. i; V. ii. Some of these would probably have been\r\ntreated in a sixteenth-century play as threshold scenes. But III. ii,\r\na child-bed scene, would have called for curtains. In _Chaste Maid_,\r\nhowever, the opening s.d. is ‘A bed thrust out upon the stage; Allwit’s\r\nwife in it’. We cannot therefore assume curtains; cf. p. 113. The room\r\nis above (ll. 102, 124) and is set with stools and rushes. In V. iv,\r\ntwo funeral processions meet in the street, and ‘while all the company\r\nseem to weep and mourn, there is a sad song in the music-room’.\r\n\r\n[232] Florio, _Dictionary_, ‘_Scena_ ... forepart of a theatre where\r\nplayers make them readie, being trimmed with hangings’ (cf. vol. ii, p.\r\n539); Jonson, _Cynthia’s Revels_, ind. 151, ‘I am none of your fresh\r\nPictures, that use to beautifie the decay’d dead Arras, in a publique\r\nTheater’; Heywood, _Apology_, 18 (Melpomene _loq._), ‘Then did I tread\r\non arras; cloth of tissue Hung round the fore-front of my stage’;\r\nFlecknoe (cf.

In several of the passages quoted above, the black-hung stage is\r\na metaphor for night, but I agree with Lawrence that black hangings\r\ncannot well have been used in the theatre to indicate night scenes\r\nas well as tragedy. I do not know why he suggests that a ‘prevalent\r\nidea that the stage was hung with blue for comedies’, for which, if it\r\nexists, there is certainly no evidence, is ‘due to a curious surmise\r\nof Malone’s’. Malone (_Var._ iii. 108) only suggests that ‘pieces of\r\ndrapery tinged with blue’ may have been ‘suspended across the stage to\r\nrepresent the heavens’--quite a different thing. But, of course, there\r\nis no evidence for that either. According to Reich, _Der Mimus_, I.\r\nii. 705, the colour of the _siparium_ in the Indian theatre is varied\r\naccording to the character of the play.\r\n\r\n[234] Cf. p. 30; vol. i, p. 231. On the removal of bodies W. Archer\r\n(_Quarterly Review_, ccviii. 454) says, ‘In over a hundred plays which\r\nwe have minutely examined (including all Shakespeare’s tragedies)\r\nthere is only a small minority of cases in which explicit provision\r\nis not made, either by stage-direction or by a line in the text, for\r\nthe removal of bodies. The few exceptions to this rule are clearly\r\nmere inadvertences, or else are due to the fact that there is a crowd\r\nof people on the stage in whose exit a body can be dragged or carried\r\noff almost unobserved’. In _Old Fortunatus_, 1206, after his sons have\r\nlamented over their dead father, ‘They both fall asleepe: Fortune and\r\na companie of Satyres enter with Musicke, and playing about Fortunatus\r\nbody, take him away’. Of course, a body left dead in the alcove need\r\nnot be removed; the closing curtains cover it.\r\n\r\n[235] Cf. p. 26.\r\n\r\n[236] Cf. p. 51, n. 3 (_Downfall of R.

On the other hand, in _Old\r\nFortunatus_, 609 (ind.), the presenters bring trees on and ‘set the\r\ntrees into the earth’. The t.p. of the 1615 _Spanish Tragedy_ shows the\r\narbour of the play as a small trellissed pergola with an arched top,\r\nnot too large, I should say, to come up and down through a commodious\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\n[268] _1 Contention_, sc. ii (cf. p. 56, n. 3); _John a Kent_, III. i\r\n(cf. p. 74, n. 3); &c.\r\n\r\n[269] _Looking Glass_, IV. ii, s.d. ‘Jonas the Prophet cast out of the\r\nWhales belly vpon the Stage’.\r\n\r\n[270] _Dr. Faustus_, 1450, s.d.

In view of their dates and doubtful provenances\r\n(cf. _Bibl. Note_ to ch. xviii), these are no evidence for the\r\nsixteenth-century public theatre, but they show that at some plays,\r\npublic or private, the audience continued to sit ‘over the stage’ well\r\nin to the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[276] Cf. vol. ii, p. 542.\r\n\r\n[277] Cf. p. 45.\r\n\r\n[278] _Henslowe Papers_, 139.\r\n\r\n[279] _James IV_, 106, 605, 618, 1115.\r\n\r\n[280] _Looking Glass_, 152, 1756.\r\n\r\n[281] _T. of a Shrew_, scc. ii, xvi. In _T. of the Shrew_, sc. ii of\r\nthe Induction is ‘aloft’ (1), and the presenters ‘sit’ to watch the\r\nplay (147), but they only comment once (I. i. 254) with the s.d. ‘The\r\nPresenters aboue speakes’, and Sly is not carried down at the end.\r\n\r\n[282] Cf. p. 57, n. 4. The main induction ends (38) with, ‘Why stay we\r\nthen? Lets giue the Actors leaue, And, as occasion serues, make our\r\nreturne’.\r\n\r\n[283] Revenge says (I. i. 90), ‘Here sit we downe to see the misterie,\r\nAnd serue for Chorus in this Tragedie’, and the Ghost (III. xv. 38),\r\n‘I will sit to see the rest’. In IV. i Hieronimo discusses with his\r\nfriends a tragedy which he has promised to give before the Court, and\r\nalludes (184) to ‘a wondrous shew besides. That I will haue there\r\nbehinde a curtaine’. The actual performance occupies part of IV. iii,\r\niv (a continuous scene). In IV. iii. 1, ‘Enter Hieronimo; he knocks up\r\nthe curtaine’. We must not be misled by the modern French practice of\r\nknocking for the rise of the front curtain. The tragedy has not yet\r\nbegun, and this is no front curtain, but the curtain already referred\r\nto in IV. i, which Hieronimo is now hammering up to conceal the dead\r\nbody of Horatio, as part of the setting which he is arranging at one\r\nend of the main stage. The Duke of Castile now enters, and it is clear\r\nthat the Court audience are to sit ‘above’, for Hieronimo begs the\r\nDuke (12) that ‘when the traine are past into the gallerie, You would\r\nvouchsafe to throw me downe the key’. He then bids (16) a Servant\r\n‘Bring a chaire and a cushion for the King’ and ‘hang up the Title: Our\r\nscene is Rhodes’. We are still concerned with Court customs, and no\r\nlight is thrown on the possible use of title-boards on the public stage\r\n(cf. p. 126). The royal train take their places, and the performance\r\nis given. Hieronimo epilogizes and suddenly (IV. iv. 88) ‘Shewes his\r\ndead sonne’.

J._ II. ii Romeo is in the orchard, and (2) ‘But soft,\r\nwhat light through yonder window breaks?’ The lovers discourse, he\r\nbelow, she ‘o’er my head’ (27). Presently (F_{1}; Q_{1}, is summary\r\nhere) Juliet says ‘I hear some noise within’ (136), followed by s.d.\r\n‘Cals within’ and a little later ‘Within: Madam’, twice. Juliet then\r\n‘Exit’ (155), and (159) ‘Enter Juliet again’. Modern editors have\r\nreshuffled the s.ds. In III. v, Q_{2} (reproduced in F_{1}), in\r\naddition to textual differences from Q_{1}, may represent a revised\r\nhandling of the scene. Q_{1} begins ‘Enter Romeo and Juliet at the\r\nwindow’. They discuss the dawn. Then ‘He goeth downe’, speaks from\r\nbelow, and ‘Exit’. Then ‘Enter Nurse hastely’ and says ‘Your Mother’s\r\ncomming to your Chamber’. Then ‘She goeth downe from the Window’. I\r\ntake this to refer to Juliet, and to close the action above, at a\r\npoint represented by III. v. 64 of the modern text. Then follow ‘Enter\r\nJuliets Mother, Nurse’ and a dialogue below. Q_{2} begins ‘Enter\r\nRomeo and Juliet aloft’. Presently (36) ‘Enter Madame [? an error]\r\nand Nurse’, and the warning is given while Romeo is still above.\r\nJuliet says (41) ‘Then, window, let day in, and let life out’, and\r\nRomeo, ‘I’ll descend’. After his ‘Exit’ comes ‘Enter Mother’ (64), and\r\npretty clearly discourses with Juliet, not below, but in her chamber.\r\nOtherwise there would be no meaning in Juliet’s ‘Is she not downe so\r\nlate or vp so early? What vnaccustomd cause procures her hither?’\r\nProbably, although there is no s.d., they descend (125) to meet\r\nCapulet, for at the end of the scene Juliet bids the Nurse (231) ‘Go\r\nin’, and herself ‘Exit’ to visit Friar Laurence.\r\n\r\n[288] Cf. p. 65, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[289] Cf. p. 58, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[290] Cf. p. 119.\r\n\r\n[291] _Arden of Feversham_, III. i (p. 61, n. 3), and _Death of R.\r\nHood_, IV. i (p. 66, n. 1), require stairs of which the foot or\r\n‘threshold’ is visible. For the execution scene in _Sir T. More_,\r\nsc. xvii (p. 57, n. 2), the whole stairs should be visible, but\r\nperhaps here, as elsewhere, the scaffold, although More likens it to\r\na ‘gallerie’, was to be at least in part a supplementary structure.\r\nThe Admiral’s inventory of 1598 (_Henslowe Papers_, 116; cf. ch. ii,\r\np. 168) included ‘j payer of stayers for Fayeton’. In _Soliman and\r\nPerseda_, I. iii (p. 57, n. 4), where the back wall represents the\r\nouter wall of a tiltyard, ladders are put up against it.\r\n\r\n[292] Albright, 66; Lawrence, ii. 45.

Haigh, _Attic Theatre_^3, 201), although he is thinking of it as a\r\ndevice for ‘thrusting’ out a set interior from the alcove, which does\r\nnot seem to me necessary.\r\n\r\n[301] _Henslowe Papers_, 118. The ‘j payer of stayers for Fayeton’\r\nmay have been a similar structure; cf. p. 95, n. 4. Otway, _Venice\r\nPreserved_ (_1682_), V, has ‘Scene opening discovers a scaffold and a\r\nwheel prepared for the executing of Pierre’.\r\n\r\n[302] _Henslowe Papers_, 116.\r\n\r\n[303] Cf. p. 56, nn. 2, 3.

I am not clear whether _Volpone_, V. 2801, ‘Volpone\r\npeepes from behinde a trauerse’ is below or above, but in either event\r\nthe traverse in this case must have been a comparatively low screen and\r\nfree from attachment at the top, as Volpone says (2761), ‘I’le get up,\r\nBehind the cortine, on a stoole, and harken; Sometime, peepe ouer’.\r\n\r\n[363] _M.

Most of the scenes are in some\r\nindefinite place in the castle, called in II. ii. 161 ‘here in the\r\nlobby’ (Q_{2}, F_{1}) or ‘here in the gallery’ (Q_{1}). Possibly the\r\naudience for the play scene (III. ii) were in the alcove, as there is\r\nnothing to suggest that they were above; or they may have been to right\r\nand left, and the players in the alcove; it is guesswork.\r\n\r\n[366] _Oth._ V. ii. 1, ‘Enter Othello with a light’ (Q_{1}), ‘Enter\r\nOthello and Desdemona in her bed’ (F_{1}). It is difficult to say\r\nwhether _Maid’s Tragedy_, V. i. 2 (continuous scene), where Evadne’s\r\nentry and colloquy with a gentleman of the bedchamber is followed by\r\ns.d. ‘King abed’, implies a ‘discovery’ or not.\r\n\r\n[367] _D. Charter_, I. v. 547, ‘Enter _Lucretia_ alone in her night\r\ngowne untired, bringing in a chaire, which she planteth upon the Stage’\r\n... (579) ‘Enter Gismond di Viselli untrussed in his Night-cap, tying\r\nhis points’ ...

Barbarossa comes into ‘this parler\r\nhere’ (700), finds the murdered body, and they ‘locke up the dores\r\nthere’ and ‘bring in the body’ (777), which is therefore evidently not\r\nbehind a curtain.\r\n\r\n[368] _D. Charter_, IV. iii. 2005, ‘Enter Lucretia richly attired with\r\na Phyal in her hand’ ... ‘Enter two Pages with a Table, two looking\r\nglasses, a box with Combes and instruments, a rich bowle’. She paints\r\nand is poisoned, and a Physician bids ‘beare in her body’ (2146).\r\n\r\n[369] _D.

Then a rich Bed\r\nis thrust out and they enter again’, and Tullius says ‘This is the\r\nlodging called Elysium’. Later examples are Sir W. Berkeley, _The Lost\r\nLady_ (1638), V. i, ‘Enter the Moor on her bed, Hermione, Phillida, and\r\nIrene. The bed thrust out’; Suckling, _Aglaura_ (1646), V, ‘A bed put\r\nout. Thersames and Aglaura in it.... Draw in the Bed’; Davenport, _City\r\nNight Cap_ (1661, Cockpit), II. i, ‘A bed thrust out. Lodovico sleeping\r\nin his clothes; Dorothea in bed’.\r\n\r\n[374] _Silver Age_, IV, ‘Enter Semele drawne out in her bed’; _Hector\r\nof Germany_, I. i, ‘a bed thrust out, the Palsgrave lying sick on\r\nit, the King of Bohemia, the Duke of Savoy, the Marquis Brandenburg\r\nentering with him’; _Chaste Maid in Cheapside_, III. ii. 1, ‘A bed\r\nthrust out upon the stage; Allwit’s wife in it’. This appears from\r\n‘call him up’ (102) to be on the upper stage. _Golden Age_, I, ‘Enter\r\nSibilla lying in child-bed, with her child lying by her, and her Nurse,\r\n&c.’ has the Cymbeline formula, but presumably the staging was as for\r\nDanae.\r\n\r\n[375] _Golden Age_, IV, ‘Enter foure old Beldams’, and say ‘The ‘larme\r\nbell rings’; it is Acrisius; they will ‘clap close to the gate and let\r\nhim in’. He bids them watch ‘your percullist entrance’, says ‘Danae is\r\ndescended’, speaks of ‘the walkes within this barricadoed mure’. She\r\nreturns ‘unto her chamber’ and he ‘Exit’. The beldams will ‘take our\r\nlodgings before the Princesse chamber’ and ‘Exit’. Then ‘Enter Iupiter\r\nlike a Pedler, the Clowne his man, with packs at their backes’. They\r\nare evidently outside the gate. ‘He rings the bell’ and persuades the\r\nbeldams to let him ‘into the Porters lodge’. They will ‘shut the gate\r\nfor feare the King come and if he ring clap the Pedlers into some of\r\nyon old rotten corners’. Then ‘Enter Danae’, whom Jupiter courts. She\r\nsays ‘Yon is my doore’ and ‘Exit’. The beldams will ‘see the Pedlers\r\npack’t out of the gate’, but in the end let them ‘take a nap upon\r\nsome bench or other’, and bid them good-night. Jupiter ‘puts off his\r\ndisguise’ and ‘Exit’. Then ‘Enter the foure old Beldams, drawing out\r\nDanae’s bed: she in it. They place foure tapers at the foure corners’.\r\nJupiter returns ‘crown’d with his imperiall robes’, says ‘Yon is the\r\ndoore’, calls Danae by name, ‘lyes upon her bed’ and ‘puts out the\r\nlights and makes unready’. Presently ‘The bed is drawne in, and enter\r\nthe Clowne new wak’t’, followed by ‘Enter Iupiter and Danae in her\r\nnight-gowne’. He puts on his cloak, and ‘Enter the foure Beldams in\r\nhast’, say ‘the gate is open’, and dismiss the pedlars.\r\n\r\n[376] _M. Ado_, III. iv. Presumably the action is at the window, as\r\nthere is a ‘new tire within’ (13) and Hero withdraws when guests arrive\r\n(95). It is of course the same window which is required by Don John’s\r\nplot, although it is not again in action (cf. II. ii. 43; iii. 89; III.\r\nii. 116, iii. 156; IV. i. 85, 311).\r\n\r\n[377] _Volpone_, II. v-vii.

W._ II. ii; III. v, in both of which persons ‘below’ are\r\nbidden ‘come up’; possibly V. i; cf. IV. v, 13, 22, 131, where persons\r\nbelow speak of the chamber as above.\r\n\r\n[379] _E. M.

Elizabeth bids Gage\r\n‘Looke to the pathway that doth come from the court’, perhaps from a\r\nwindow at the back (cf. p. 96), and he describes a coming horseman.\r\n\r\n[380] _Yorkshire Tragedy_, scc. iii, v, vii, while the intermediate\r\nepisodes, scc. iv, vi, are below. It is all really one scene.\r\n\r\n[381] _Sejanus_ (F_{1}), i. 355–469 (cf. 287), an episode breaking the\r\nflow of the main action, a hall scene, of the act; it must be apart\r\nfrom the hall, not perhaps necessarily above.\r\n\r\n[382] _E. M. O._ V. ii, preceded and followed by scene near the court\r\ngate at the foot of stairs leading to the great chamber; V. i has ‘Is\r\nthis the way? good truth here be fine hangings’ and ‘courtiers drop\r\nout’, presumably through the arras and up the stairs. Then a presenter\r\nsays, ‘Here they come’, and the courtiers enter, presumably above.\r\n\r\n[383] _A. and C._ IV. xv. 1, ‘Enter Cleopatra, and her Maides aloft’,\r\nwith (8) ‘Look out o’ the other side your monument’ ... (37) ‘They\r\nheave Anthony aloft to Cleopatra’; V. ii; cf. 360, ‘bear her women from\r\nthe monument’.\r\n\r\n[384] _Pericles_, III. i (prol. 58, ‘In your imagination hold This\r\nstage the ship’); V. i (prol. 21, ‘In your supposing once more put your\r\nsight Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark’). The other scenes (_1\r\nContention_, sc. xii; _A. and C._ II. vii; _Tp._ I. i) have nothing\r\ndirectly indicating action ‘above’.\r\n\r\n[385] _Ham._ I. i, iv, v; cf. I. ii. 213, ‘upon the platform where we\r\nwatch’d’. There would be hardly room ‘above’ for the Ghost to waft\r\nHamlet to ‘a more removed ground’ (I. iv. 61), and the effect of I. v.\r\n148, where ‘Ghost cries under the Stage’, would be less. On the other\r\nhand, in _White Devil_ (Queen’s), IV. iv. 39 the s.d. ‘A Cardinal on\r\nthe Tarras’ is explained by Flamineo’s words, ‘Behold! my lord of\r\nArragon appeares, On the church battlements’.\r\n\r\n[386] _J.

Pearson). There is a complete absence of s.ds.\r\nfor ‘above’; cf. p. 58. But in _J. C._ III. i and _Catiline_, V. vi,\r\nat least, action in the senate house is continuous with action in the\r\nstreet or forum without, and both places must have been shown, and\r\nsomehow differentiated.\r\n\r\n[387] _Bonduca_, V. i, ‘Enter Caratach upon a rock, and Hengo by him,\r\nsleeping’; V. iii, ‘Enter Caratach and Hengo on the Rock’. Hengo is let\r\ndown by a belt to fetch up food. It is ‘a steep rock i th’ woods’ (V.\r\nii); cf. the rock scene in _Brazen Age_, V (cf. p. 109).\r\n\r\n[388] Cf. p. 153. _Duchess of Malfi_, III. ii, with (173) ‘call up our\r\nofficers’ is a possible exception.\r\n\r\n[389] _E.

So, too, in _T. N. K._ V. iii, the fight between Palamon and\r\nArcite takes place within; Emilia will not see it, and it is reported\r\nto her on the main stage.\r\n\r\n[390] _D. an Ass_, II. vi. 37, ‘This Scene is acted at two windo’s\r\nas out of two contiguous buildings’ ...

A court scene in _Sir T. Wyatt_\r\nends (ed. Hazlitt, p. 10) with s.d. ‘pass round the stage’, which takes\r\nthe personages to the Tower. Similarly in _1 If You Know Not Me_ (ed.\r\nPearson, p. 246) a scene at Hatfield ends ‘And now to London, lords,\r\nlead on the way’, with s.d. ‘Sennet about the Stage in order. The Maior\r\nof London meets them’, and in _2 If You Know Not Me_ (p. 342) troops\r\nstart from Tilbury, and ‘As they march about the stage, Sir Francis\r\nDrake and Sir Martin Furbisher meet them’.\r\n\r\n[395] W.

Lawrence, ii. 25 (_Windows on the Pre-Restoration Stage_),\r\ncites T. M. _Black Book_ (1604), ‘And marching forward to the third\r\ngarden-house, there we knocked up the ghost of mistress Silverpin,\r\nwho suddenly risse out of two white sheets, and acted out of her\r\ntiring-house window’. It appears from Tate Wilkinson’s _Memoirs_\r\n(Lawrence, i. 177) that the proscenium balconies were common ground to\r\nactors and audience in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[400] _Family of Love_, I. iii. 101.\r\n\r\n[401] The theory is best represented by C. Brodmeier, _Die\r\nShakespeare-Bühne nach den alten Bühnenanweisungen_ (1904); V.\r\nAlbright, _The Shakespearian Stage_ (1909).\r\n\r\n[402] Thorndike, 106.\r\n\r\n[403] Cf. pp. 41, 126, 154.\r\n\r\n[404] Palace of Tiberius (Acts I, II, III), Senate house (III, V),\r\nGardens of Eudemus (II), Houses of Agrippina (II, IV), Sejanus (V),\r\nRegulus (V).\r\n\r\n[405] Houses of Volpone (I, II, III, V), Corvino (II), Would Be (V),\r\nLaw court (IV, V).\r\n\r\n[406] Houses of Catiline (I, IV), Fulvia (II), Cicero (III, IV, V),\r\nLecca (III), Brutus (IV), Spinther (V. vi), Cornificius (V. vi), Caesar\r\n(V. vi), Senate house (IV, V), Milvian Bridge (IV).\r\n\r\n[407] _Alchemist_, _III._ v. 58, ‘He speakes through the keyhole,\r\nthe other knocking’. _Hen. VIII_, V. ii, iii (continuous scene) also\r\nrequires a council-chamber door upon the stage, at which Cranmer is\r\nstopped after he has entered through the stage-door.\r\n\r\n[408] Daborne gave Tourneur ‘an act of y^e Arreignment of London to\r\nwrite’ (_Henslowe Papers_, 72).\r\n\r\n[409] Cf. ch. xxii.\r\n\r\n[410] _M. N. D._ III. ii. 463 (F_{1}), ‘They sleep all the Act’; i.\r\ne. all the act-interval (cf. p. 131). So in _Catiline_ the storm with\r\nwhich Act III ends is still on at the beginning of Act IV, and in\r\n_Alchemist_ Mammon and Lovewit are seen approaching at the ends of Acts\r\nI and IV respectively, but in both cases the actual arrival is at the\r\nbeginning of the next act.\r\n\r\n[411] F. A. Foster, _Dumb Show in Elizabethan Drama before 1620_ (_E.\r\nS._ xliv. 8).\r\n\r\n[412] Jonson has a ‘Chorus--of musicians’ between the acts of\r\n_Sejanus_, and the presenter of _Two Lamentable Tragedies_ bids\r\nthe audience ‘Delight your eares with pleasing harmonie’ after the\r\nharrowing end of Act II. Some other examples given in Lawrence, i. 75\r\n(_Music and Song in the Elizabethan Drama_), seem to me no more than\r\nincidental music such as may occur at any point of a play. Malone\r\n(_Var._ iii. 111) describes a copy of the Q_{2} of _R. J._ in which\r\nthe act endings and directions for inter-act music had been marked in\r\nmanuscript; but this might be of late date.\r\n\r\n[413] _Malcontent_, ind. 89.\r\n\r\n[414] _Henslowe Papers_, 127.\r\n\r\n[415] _Catiline_, I. i.\r\n\r\n[416] _Second Maidens Tragedy_, 1719, ‘Exit’ the Tyrant, four lines\r\nfrom the end of a court scene, and 1724 ‘Enter the Tirant agen at a\r\nfarder dore, which opened, bringes hym to the Toombe’ (cf. p. 110,\r\nn. 8). So in _Woman Killed with Kindness_ (Queen’s), IV. ii, iii\r\n(continuous scene), Mrs. Frankford and her lover retire from a hall\r\nscene to sup in her chamber, and the servants are bidden to lock\r\nthe house doors. In IV. iv Frankford enters with a friend, and says\r\n(8) ‘This is the key that opes my outward gate; This the hall-door;\r\nthis the withdrawing chamber; But this ... It leads to my polluted\r\nbedchamber’. Then (17) ‘now to my gate’, where they light a lanthorn,\r\nand (23) ‘this is the last door’, and in IV. v Frankford emerges as\r\nfrom the bedchamber. Probably sc. iv is supposed to begin before the\r\nhouse. They go behind at (17), emerge through another door, and the\r\nscene is then in the hall, whence Frankford passes at (23) through the\r\ncentral aperture behind again.\r\n\r\n[417] _Wily Beguiled_, prol. The Prologus asks a player the name of the\r\nplay, and is told ‘Sir you may look vpon the Title’. He complains that\r\nit is ‘_Spectrum_ once again’. Then a Juggler enters, will show him a\r\ntrick, and says ‘With a cast of cleane conveyance, come aloft _Jack_\r\nfor thy masters advantage (hees gone I warrant ye)’ and there is the\r\ns.d. ‘_Spectrum_ is conveied away: and _Wily beguiled_, stands in the\r\nplace of it’.\r\n\r\n[418] Most of the examples in Lawrence, i. 43 (_Title and Locality\r\nBoards on the Pre-Restoration Stage_) belong to Court or to private\r\ntheatres; on the latter cf. p. 154, _infra_. But the prologue to _1 Sir\r\nJohn Oldcastle_ begins ‘The doubtful Title (Gentlemen) prefixt Upon\r\nthe Argument we have in hand May breede suspence’.

Jonson’s own\r\nscene-division is of course determined by the introduction of new\r\nspeakers (cf. p. 200) and does not precisely follow the textual\r\nindications.\r\n\r\n[425] _Henslowe Papers_, 116.\r\n\r\n[426] _2 If You Know Not Me_ (ed.

Corey, _Generous\r\nEnemies_ (1672), prol.:\r\n\r\n    Coarse hangings then, instead of scenes, were worn.\r\n    And Kidderminster did the stage adorn.\r\n\r\nGraves, 78, suggests pictorial ‘painted cloths’ for\r\nbackgrounds.\r\n\r\n[428] ‘Scenes’ were used in the public performances of Nabbes’s\r\n_Microcosmus_ (1637), Suckling’s _Aglaura_ (_1637_), and Habington’s\r\n_Queen of Arragon_ (_1640_); cf. Lawrence, ii. 121 (_The Origin of\r\nthe English Picture-Stage_); W. G. Keith, _The Designs for the First\r\nMovable Scenery on the English Stage_ (_Burlington Magazine_, xxv. 29,\r\n85).\r\n\r\n[429] For Paul’s, _C. and C. Errant_ (after each act), ‘Here they\r\nknockt up the Consort’; _Faery Pastorall_; _Trick to Catch the Old One_\r\n(after I and II), ‘music’; _What You Will_, II. ii. 235 ‘So ends our\r\nchat;--sound music for the act’; for Blackfriars, _Gentleman Usher_,\r\nIII. i. 1, ‘after the song’; _Sophonisba_ (after I), ‘the cornets and\r\norgans playing loud full music for the act’, (II) ‘Organ mixt with\r\nrecorders, for this act’, (III) ‘Organs, viols and voices play for this\r\nact’, (IV) ‘A base lute and a treble violl play for the act’, with\r\nwhich should be read the note at the end of Q_{1}, ‘let me intreat my\r\nreader not to taxe me for the fashion of the entrances and musique of\r\nthis tragedy, for know it is printed only as it was presented by youths\r\nand after the fashion of the private stage’; _K.

Boy daunceth’, (IV) Ralph’s May Day speech; cf. _infra_ and vol.\r\nii, p. 557. I do not find any similar recognition of the scene as a\r\nstructural element in the play to be introduced by music; in _1 Antonio\r\nand Mellida_, III. ii. 120, the s.d. ‘and so the Scene begins’ only\r\nintroduces a new scene in the sense of a regrouping of speakers (cf. p.\r\n200).\r\n\r\n[430] For Paul’s, _Histriomastix_, III. i. 1, ‘Enter Pride,\r\nVaine-Glory, Hypocrisie, and Contempt: Pride casts a mist, wherein\r\nMavortius and his company [who ended II] vanish off the Stage, and\r\nPride and her attendants remaine’, (after III) ‘They all awake, and\r\nbegin the following Acte’, (after V) ‘Allarmes in severall places, that\r\nbrake him off thus: after a retreat sounded, the Musicke playes and\r\nPoverty enters’; 2 ANTONIO AND MELLIDA, III. i. 1, ‘A dumb show. The\r\ncornets sounding for the Act’, (after IV) ‘The cornets sound for the\r\nact. The dumb show’; _What You Will_, III. i. 1, ‘Enter Francisco ...\r\nThey clothe Francisco whilst Bidet creeps in and observes them. Much of\r\nthis done whilst the Act is playing’; _Phoenix_ (after II), ‘Towards\r\nthe close of the musick the justices three men prepare for a robberie’;\r\nfor Blackfriars, _Malcontent_, II. i. 1, ‘Enter Mendoza with a sconce,\r\nto observe Ferneze’s entrance, who, whilst the act is playing, enters\r\nunbraced, two Pages before him with lights; is met by Maquerelle and\r\nconveyed in; the Pages are sent away’; _Fawn_, V. i. 1, ‘Whilst the Act\r\nis a-playing, Hercules and Tiberio enters; Tiberio climbs the tree,\r\nand is received above by Dulcimel, Philocalia, and a Priest; Hercules\r\nstays beneath’. The phrase ‘whilst the act is playing’ is a natural\r\ndevelopment from ‘for the act’, i. e. ‘in preparation for the act’,\r\nused also for the elaborate music which at private houses replaced the\r\nthree preliminary trumpet ‘soundings’ of the public houses; cf. _What\r\nYou Will_, ind. 1 (s.d.), ‘Before the music sounds for the Act’, and\r\n_1 Antonio and Mellida_, ind. 1, ‘The music will sound straight for\r\nentrance’. But it leads to a vagueness of thought in which the interval\r\nitself is regarded as the ‘act’; cf. the _M. N. D._ s.d. of F_{1},\r\nquoted p. 124, n. 3, with Middleton, _The Changeling_ (1653), III. i.\r\n1, ‘In the act-time De Flores hides a naked rapier behind a door’,\r\nand Cotgrave, _Dict._ (1611), ‘Acte ... also, an Act, or Pause in a\r\nComedie, or Tragedie’.\r\n\r\n[431] For Paul’s, _Histriomastix_, i. 163, ‘Enter Fourcher, Voucher,\r\nVelure, Lyon-Rash ... two and two at severall doores’; v. 103, ‘Enter\r\n... on one side ... on the other’; v. 192, ‘Enter ... at one end of\r\nthe stage: at the other end enter ...’; vi. 41, ‘Enter Mavortius\r\nand Philarchus at severall doores’; vi. 241, ‘Enter ... at the one\r\ndoore.

When a ‘state’ or throne is\r\nused (e.g. _Satiromastix_, 2309, ‘Soft musicke, Chaire is set under a\r\nCanopie’), there is no indication that it descends. In _Satiromastix_,\r\n2147, we get ‘O thou standst well, thou lean’st against a poast’, but\r\nthis is obviously inadequate evidence for a heavens supported by posts\r\nat Paul’s.\r\n\r\n[434] _C. and C. Errant_, V. ix, ‘He tooke the Bolle from behind the\r\nArras’; _Faery Pastoral_, V. iv (wood scene), ‘He tooke from behind\r\nthe Arras a Peck of goodly Acornes pilld’; _What You Will_, ind. 97,\r\n‘Let’s place ourselves within the curtains, for good faith the stage\r\nis so very little, we shall wrong the general eye else very much’;\r\n_Northward Ho!_, IV. i, ‘Lie you in ambush, behind the hangings, and\r\nperhaps you shall hear the piece of a comedy’. In _C. and C. Errant_,\r\nV. viii. 1, the two actors left on the stage at the end of V. vii were\r\njoined by a troop from the inn, and yet others coming ‘easily after\r\nthem and stealingly, so as the whole Scene was insensibly and suddenly\r\nbrought about in Catastrophe of the Comoedy. And the whole face of the\r\nScene suddenly altered’. I think that Percy is only trying to describe\r\nthe change from a nearly empty to a crowded stage, not a piece of\r\nscene-shifting.\r\n\r\n[435] _Cynthia’s Revels_ (Q), ind. 149, ‘Slid the Boy takes me for a\r\npeice of Prospective (I holde my life) or some silke Curtine, come to\r\nhang the Stage here: Sir Cracke I am none of your fresh Pictures, that\r\nuse to beautifie the decay’d dead Arras, in a publique Theater’; _K.\r\nB. P._ II. 580, ‘_Wife._ What story is that painted upon the cloth?\r\nthe confutation of Saint Paul? _Citizen._ No lambe, that Ralph and\r\nLucrece’. In _Law Tricks_, III. i, Emilia bids Lurdo ‘Behind the Arras;\r\nscape behind the Arras’. Polymetes enters, praises the ‘verie faire\r\nhangings’ representing Venus and Adonis, makes a pass at Vulcan, and\r\nnotices how the arras trembles and groans. Then comes the s.d. (which\r\nhas got in error into Bullen’s text, p. 42) ‘Discouer Lurdo behind the\r\nArras’, and Emilia carries it off by pretending that it is only Lurdo’s\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n[436] I think it is possible that _Sophonisba_, with its ‘canopy’ (cf.\r\np. 149) was also originally written for Paul’s.\r\n\r\n[437] _1, 2 Antonio and Mellida_, _Maid’s Metamorphosis_, _Wisdom of\r\nDr. Dodipoll_, _Jack Drum’s Entertainment_, _Satiromastix_, _Blurt\r\nMaster Constable_, _Bussy D’Ambois_, _Westward Ho!_, _Northward Ho!_,\r\n_Fawn_, _Michaelmas Term_, _Phoenix_, _Mad World, My Masters_, _Trick\r\nto Catch the Old One_, _Puritan_, _Woman Hater_.\r\n\r\n[438] _Jack Drum’s Ent._ v. 112.\r\n\r\n[439] _Histriomastix_, i. 6, ‘now sit wee high (tryumphant in our\r\nsway)’; ii. 1, ‘Enter Plenty upon a Throne’; iii. 11, ‘If you will sit\r\nin throne of State with Pride’; v. 1, ‘Rule, fier-eied Warre!...

In III. ii a character is spoken of after his\r\n‘Exit’ as ‘going down the staires’, which suggests action ‘above’. But\r\nother indications place the scene before Cassimere’s house.\r\n\r\n[442] _C. and C. Errant_, I. i, ‘They entered from Maldon’; I. iv,\r\n‘They entered from Harwich all’.\r\n\r\n[443] _C. and C.

P._ xii. 248) gives the note as ‘In the middle and\r\nalofte Oceanus Pallace The Scene being. Next Proteus-Hall’. This seems\r\nbarely grammatical and I am not sure that it is complete. A limitation\r\nof Paul’s is suggested by the s.d. (ibid. 258) ‘Chambers (noise supposd\r\nfor Powles) For actors’, but apparently ‘a showre of Rose-water and\r\nconfits’ was feasible.\r\n\r\n[445] _Faery Pastoral_, p. 162, ‘A Scrolle fell into her lap from\r\nabove’.\r\n\r\n[446] _Jack Drum_, II. 27, ‘The Casement opens, and Katherine\r\nappeares’; 270, ‘Winifride lookes from aboue’; 286, ‘Camelia, from her\r\nwindow’.\r\n\r\n[447] I give s.ds. with slight corrections from Bullen, who\r\nsubstantially follows 1633. But he has re-divided his scenes; 1633 has\r\nacts only for _1 Antonio and Mellida_ (in spite of s.d. ‘and so the\r\nscene begins’ with a new speaker at III. ii. 120); acts and scenes, by\r\nspeakers, for _2 Antonio and Mellida_; and acts and scenes or acts and\r\nfirst scenes only, not by speakers and very imperfectly, for the rest.\r\n\r\n[448] _1 Ant. and Mell._ I. 100, ‘Enter above ... Enter below’ ...\r\n(117) ‘they two stand ... whilst the scene passeth above’ ... (140)\r\n‘Exeunt all on the lower stage’ ... (148) ‘_Rossaline._ Prithee, go\r\ndown!’ ...

(s.d.) ‘The curtains drawn, and the body of Feliche, stabb’d\r\nthick with wounds, appears hung up’ and ‘_Antonio._ What villain bloods\r\nthe window of my love?’\r\n\r\n[451] III. ii. 1, ‘Enter ... Maria, her hair loose’ ... (59) ‘_Maria._\r\nPages, leave the room’ ... (65) ‘Maria draweth the curtain: and the\r\nghost of Andrugio is displayed, sitting on the bed’ ... (95) ‘Exit\r\nMaria to her bed, Andrugio drawing the curtains’.\r\n\r\n[452] V. ii. 50, ‘While the measure is dancing, Andrugio’s ghost is\r\nplaced betwixt the music-houses’ ... (115) ‘The curtaine being drawn,\r\nexit Andrugio’.\r\n\r\n[453] V. ii. 112, ‘They run all at Piero with their rapiers’. This is\r\nwhile the ghost is present above, but (152) ‘The curtains are drawn,\r\nPiero departeth’.\r\n\r\n[454] III. i. 33, ‘And, lo, the ghost of old Andrugio Forsakes his\r\ncoffin’ ... (125) ‘Ghosts ... from above and beneath’ ... (192) ‘From\r\nunder the stage a groan’; IV. ii. 87, ‘They strike the stage with their\r\ndaggers, and the grave openeth’. The church must have been shown open,\r\nand part of the crowded action of these scenes kept outside; at IV. ii.\r\n114, ‘yon bright stars’ are visible.\r\n\r\n[455] _Fawn_, IV. 638, ‘_Dulcimel._ Father, do you see that tree,\r\nthat leans just on my chamber window?’ ... (V. 1) ‘whilst the Act is\r\na-playing, Hercules and Tiberio enters; Tiberio climbs the tree, and is\r\nreceived above by Dulcimel, Philocalia, and a Priest: Hercules stays\r\nbeneath’. After a mask and other action in the presence, (461) ‘Tiberio\r\nand Dulcimel above, are discovered hand in hand’.\r\n\r\n[456] _W. You Will_, IV. 373, after a dance, ‘_Celia._ Will you to\r\ndinner?’ ... (V. 1) ‘The curtains are drawn by a Page, and Celia (&c.)\r\ndisplayed, sitting at dinner’.\r\n\r\n[457] II. 1, ‘One knocks: Laverdure draws the curtains, sitting on his\r\nbed, apparelling himself; his trunk of apparel standing by him’ ...\r\n(127) ‘Bidet, I’ll down’; II. ii. 1, ‘Enter a schoolmaster, draws the\r\ncurtains behind, with Battus, Nous, Slip, Nathaniel, and Holophernes\r\nPippo, schoolboys, sitting, with books in their hands’.\r\n\r\n[458] I. 110, ‘He sings and is answered; from above a willow garland is\r\nflung down, and the song ceaseth’.\r\n\r\n[459] _Satiromastix_, I. ii. 1, ‘Horrace sitting in a study behinde a\r\ncurtaine, a candle by him burning, bookes lying confusedly’.\r\n\r\n[460] V. ii. 23, where the ‘canopie’, if a Paul’s term, may be the\r\nequivalent of the public theatre alcove (cf. pp. 82, 120). The ‘bower’\r\nin IV. iii holds eight persons, and a recess may have been used.\r\n\r\n[461] Shorthose says (V. i. 60) ‘Thou lean’st against a poast’, but\r\nobviously posts supporting a heavens at Paul’s cannot be inferred.\r\n\r\n[462] _Westward Ho!_ uses the houses of Justiniano (I. i), Wafer (III.\r\niii), Ambush (III. iv), the Earl (II. ii; IV. ii), and a Bawd (IV. i),\r\nthe shops of Tenterhook (I. ii; III. i) and Honeysuckle (II. i), and\r\ninns at the Steelyard (II. iii), Shoreditch (II. iii), and Brentford\r\n(V). Continuous setting would not construct so many houses for single\r\nscenes. There is action above at the Bawd’s, and interior action below\r\nin several cases; in IV. ii, ‘the Earle drawes a curten and sets forth\r\na banquet’. The s.ds. of this scene seem inadequate; at a later point\r\nMoll is apparently ‘discovered’, shamming death. _Northward Ho!_ uses\r\nthe houses of Mayberry (I. iii; II. ii) and Doll (II. i; III. i), a\r\ngarden house at Moorfields (III. ii), Bellamont’s study (IV. i), Bedlam\r\n(IV. iii, iv), a ‘tavern entry’ in London (I. ii), and an inn at Ware\r\n(I. i; V. i). Action above is at the last only, interior action below\r\nin several.\r\n\r\n[463] _B. d’Ambois_, II. ii. 177, ‘_Tamyra_. See, see the gulfe is\r\nopening’ ... (183) ‘Ascendit Frier and D’Ambois’ ... (296) ‘Descendit\r\nFryar’; IV. ii. 63, ‘Ascendit [Behemoth]’ ... (162) ‘Descendit cum\r\nsuis’; V. i. 155, ‘Ascendit Frier’ ... (191) ‘_Montsurry._ In, Ile\r\nafter, To see what guilty light gives this cave eyes’; V. iv. 1,\r\n‘Intrat umbra Comolet to the Countesse, wrapt in a canapie’ ... (23)\r\n‘D’Amboys at the gulfe’.\r\n\r\n[464] The Q of 1641, probably representing a revival by the King’s men,\r\nalters the scenes in Montsurry’s house, eliminating the characteristic\r\nPaul’s ‘canapie’ of V. iv. 1 and placing spectators above in the same\r\nscene. It is also responsible for the proleptic s.d. (cf. ch. xxii) at\r\nI. i. 153 for I. ii. 1, ‘Table, Chesbord and Tapers behind the Arras’.\r\n\r\n[465] _Blurt Master Constable_ has (_a_) Camillo’s (I. i; II. i) with a\r\nhall; (_b_) Hippolyto’s (III. i) where (136) ‘Violetta appears above’,\r\nand (175) ‘Enter Truepenny above with a letter’; (_c_) a chapel (III.\r\nii) with a ‘pit-hole’ dungeon, probably also visible in II. i and III.\r\ni; (_d_) Blurt’s (I. ii) which is ‘twelve score off’; (_e_) Imperia’s,\r\nwhere is most of the action (II. ii; III. iii; IV. i, ii, iii; V. ii,\r\niii). Two chambers below are used; into one Lazarillo is shown in III.\r\niii. 201, and here in IV. ii he is let through a trap into a sewer,\r\nwhile (38) ‘Enter Frisco above laughing’ and (45) ‘Enter Imperia\r\nabove’. At IV. iii. 68 Lazarillo crawls from the sewer into the street.\r\nIn IV. i and IV. iii tricks are played upon Curvetto with a cord and a\r\nrope-ladder hanging from a window above.\r\n\r\n[466] _Phoenix_ has (_a_) the palace (I. i; V. i) with hall; (_b_)\r\nFalso’s (I. vi; II. iii; III. i); (_c_) the Captain’s (I. ii; II. ii);\r\n(_d_) a tavern (I. iv; IV. iii) with interior action; (_e_) a law court\r\n(IV. i); (_f_) a jeweller’s (III. ii; IV. i, ii, iii) with interior\r\naction. It will be observed that (_f_) is needed both with (_d_) and\r\n(_e_). There is no action above.\r\n\r\n[467] _M. Term_ has (_a_) Paul’s (I. i, ii); (_b_) Quomodo’s shop, the\r\nThree Knaves (II. iii; III. iv; IV. i, iii, iv; V. i); (_c_) a tavern\r\n(II. i); (_d_) a law court (V. iii); (_e_) a courtesan’s (III. i;\r\nIV. ii). All have interior action and (_b_) eavesdropping above in a\r\nbalcony (II. iii. 108, 378, 423; III. iv). Much action is merely in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n[468] _A Mad World_ has (_a_) Harebrain’s (I. ii; III. i; IV. iv);\r\n(_b_) Penitent Brothel’s (IV. i), with interior action; (_c_) a\r\ncourtesan’s (I. i; II. iii, vi; III. ii; IV. v), with a bed and five\r\npersons at once, perhaps above, in III. ii; (_d_) Sir Bounteous\r\nProgress’s in the country (II. i; II. ii, iv, v, vii; III. iii; IV. ii,\r\niii; V. i, ii). The action here is rather puzzling, but apparently a\r\nhall, a lodging next it, where are ‘Curtains drawn’ (II. vii. 103), the\r\nstairs, and a ‘closet’ or ‘matted chamber’ (IV. ii. 27; IV. iii. 3) are\r\nall used. If the scenes were shifted, the interposition of a scene of\r\nonly 7 lines (II. iii) at London amongst a series of country scenes is\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\n[469] _A Trick to Catch_ has (_a_) Lucre’s (I. iii, iv; II. i, ii;\r\nIV. ii, iii; V. i); (_b_) Hoard’s (III. ii; IV. iv; V. ii); (_c_) a\r\ncourtesan’s (III. i); (_d_) an inn (III. iii); (_e_) Dampit’s (III. iv;\r\nIV. v); and away from London, (_f_) Witgood Hall, with (_g_) an inn (I.\r\ni, ii); (_h_) Cole Harbour (IV. i). Nearly all the action is exterior,\r\nbut a window above is used at (_b_) in IV. iv, and at (_e_) there is\r\ninterior action both below in III. iv and perhaps above (cf. III. iv.\r\n72), with a bed and eight persons at once in IV. v.\r\n\r\n[470] _Puritan_ has (_a_) the Widow’s (I. i; II. i, ii; III. i, ii;\r\nIV. i, ii, iii; V. i, ii), with a garden and rosemary bush; (_b_) a\r\ngentleman’s house (III. iv); (_c_) an apothecary’s (III. iii); (_d_) a\r\nprison (I. iv; III. v). There is interior action below in all; action\r\nabove only in (_a_) at V. ii. 1, ‘Enter Sir John Penidub, and Moll\r\naboue lacing of her clothes’ in a balcony.\r\n\r\n[471] _Woman Hater_ has (_a_) the Duke’s palace (I. i, iii; IV. i; V.\r\nii); (_b_) the Count’s (I. iii); (_c_) Gondarino’s (II. i; III. i, ii);\r\n(_d_) Lazarillo’s lodging (I. i, ii); (_e_) a courtesan’s (II. i; IV.\r\nii, iii; V. ii); (_f_) a mercer’s shop (III. iv); (_g_) Lucio’s study\r\n(V. i). There is interior action below in (_a_), (_e_), (_f_), and\r\n(_g_), where ‘Enter Lazarello, and two Intelligencers, Lucio being at\r\nhis study.... Secretary draws the Curtain’. A window above is used at\r\n(_e_), and there is also action above at (_c_), apparently in a loggia\r\nwithin sight and ear-shot of the street.\r\n\r\n[472] The term is used in _The Faery Pastoral_, _Satiromastix_, and\r\n_Bussy d’Ambois_ (_vide supra_); but also in _Sophonisba_ (_vide\r\ninfra_), which is a Blackfriars play.\r\n\r\n[473] I take it that it was in this stand that Andrugio’s ghost was\r\nplaced ‘betwixt the music-houses’ in _2 Antonio and Mellida_.\r\n\r\n[474] The four plays which seem most repugnant to continuous staging,\r\n_Westward Ho!_, _Northward Ho!_, _A Mad World, my Masters_, and _A\r\nTrick to Catch the Old One_, are all datable in 1604–6.\r\n\r\n[475] Elizabethan Plays: _Love’s Metamorphosis_, _Liberality and\r\nProdigality_, _Cynthia’s Revels_, _Poetaster_, _Sir Giles Goosecap_,\r\n_Gentleman Usher_, and probably _All Fools_; Jacobean Plays: _M.\r\nd’Olive_, _May Day_, _Widow’s Tears_, _Conspiracy of Byron_, _Tragedy\r\nof Byron_, _Case is Altered_, _Malcontent_, _Dutch Courtesan_,\r\n_Sophonisba_, _Eastward Ho!_, _Your Five Gallants_, _Philotas_, _Isle\r\nof Gulls_, _Law Tricks_, _Fleir_, _Faithful Shepherdess_, _Knight of\r\nthe Burning Pestle_. In addition _Fawn_ and _Trick to Catch an Old\r\nOne_, already dealt with under Paul’s, were in the first case produced\r\nat, and in the second transferred to, Blackfriars.\r\n\r\n[476] Cf. p. 34.\r\n\r\n[477] _Lib. and Prod._ 903, ‘Here Prod. scaleth. Fortune claps a halter\r\nabout his neck, he breaketh the halter and falles’; 1245, ‘The Judge\r\nplaced, and the Clerkes under him’.\r\n\r\n[478] The fountain requires a trap. There is no action above. I cite\r\nthe scenes of Q_{1}, which are varied by Jonson in F_{1}.\r\n\r\n[479] In the prol. 27, Envy says, ‘The scene is, ha! Rome? Rome? and\r\nRome?’ (cf. p. 154). The only action above is by Julia in IV. ix. 1,\r\nbefore the palace, where (F_{1}) ‘Shee appeareth above, as at her\r\nchamber window’, and speaks thence.\r\n\r\n[480] _Sir G. G._ has, besides the London and Barnet road (III. i),\r\nthe houses of (_a_) Eugenia (I. i-iii; II; IV. i) and (_b_) Momford\r\n(I. iv; II; III. ii; IV. iii; V). Both have action within, none above.\r\nIn IV. ii. 140 persons on the street are met by pages coming from\r\nMomford’s ‘on the other side’, but (_b_) is near enough to (_a_) to\r\nenable Clarence in II to overhear from it (as directed in I. iv. 202)\r\na talk between Momford and Eugenia, probably in her porch, where (ii.\r\n17) ‘Enter Wynnefred, Anabell, with their sowing workes and sing’,\r\nand Momford passes over to Clarence at ii. 216. Two contiguous rooms\r\nin (_b_) are used for V. i, ii (a single scene). One is Clarence’s;\r\nfrom the other he is overheard. They are probably both visible to the\r\naudience, and are divided by a curtain. At V. ii. 128 ‘He draws the\r\ncurtains and sits within them’. Parrott adds other s.ds. for curtains\r\nat 191, 222, 275, which are not in Q_{1}.\r\n\r\n[481] _Gent. Usher_ has (_a_) Strozza’s (I. i; IV. i, iii; V. ii),\r\nwhere only a porch or courtyard is needed, and (_b_) Lasso’s (I. ii;\r\nII; III; IV. ii, iv; V. i, iii, iv), with a hall, overlooked by a\r\nbalcony used in V. i. 1 and V. iii. 1, and called ‘this tower’ (V. iii.\r\n5).\r\n\r\n[482] The visible houses of _All Fools_ are (_a_) Gostanzo’s, (_b_)\r\nCornelio’s, and (_c_) the Half Moon tavern, where drawers set tables\r\n(V. ii. 1), but not necessarily inside. Both (_a_) and (_b_) are\r\nrequired in II. i and IV. i, and (_a_), (_b_), and (_c_) in III. i.\r\n\r\n[483] _M. d’Olive_ has (_a_) a hall at Court (II. ii); (_b_)\r\nHieronyme’s chamber, also at Court (V. ii); (_c_) d’Olive’s chamber\r\n(III. ii; IV. ii); (_d_) Vaumont’s (I; II. i; IV. i; V. i); (_e_) St.\r\nAnne’s (III. i); of which (_b_) and (_d_) are used together in V. i, ii\r\n(a continuous scene), and probably (_c_) and (_e_) in III. i. There is\r\naction within at (_a_), (_c_), and (_d_), and above at (_d_), which has\r\ncurtained windows lit by tapers (I. 48), at one of which a page above\r\n‘looks out with a light’, followed by ladies who are bidden ‘come down’\r\n(V. i. 26, 66).\r\n\r\n[484] _May Day_ has (_a_) Quintiliano’s, (_b_) Honorio’s, (_c_)\r\nLorenzo’s, and (_d_) the Emperor’s Head, with an arbour (III. iii.\r\n203). The only interior action is in Honorio’s hall (V). Windows above\r\nare used at Lorenzo’s, with a rope-ladder, over a terrace (III. iii),\r\nand at Quintiliano’s (III. ii). The action, which is rather difficult\r\nto track, consists largely of dodging about the pales of gardens and\r\nbacksides (II. i. 180; III. iii. 120, 185; IV. ii. 83, 168). Clearly\r\n(_a_), (_c_), and (_d_) are all used in the latter part of II. i, where\r\na new scene may begin at 45; and similarly (_b_), (_c_), and (_d_) in\r\nIII. iii, and (_b_) and (_c_) in IV. ii.\r\n\r\n[485] _Widow’s Tears_ has (_a_) Lysander’s (I. i; II. i; III. i); (_b_)\r\nEudora’s (I. ii; II. ii, iv; III. ii; IV. i); (_c_) Arsace’s (II. iii);\r\nall of which are required in I. iii; and (_d_), a tomb (IV. ii, iii;\r\nV). There is interior action in a hall of (_b_), watched from a ‘stand’\r\n(I. i. 157; I. iii. 1) without, and the tomb opens and shuts; no action\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[486] In the _Conspiracy_ the Paris scenes are all at Court, vaguely\r\nlocated, and mainly of hall type, except III. iii, which is at an\r\nastrologer’s; the only Brussels scene is I. ii, at Court. The _Tragedy_\r\nis on the same lines, but for V. ii, in the Palace of Justice, with a\r\n‘bar’, V. iii, iv, in and before the Bastille, with a scaffold, and\r\nI. ii and III. i at Dijon, in Byron’s lodging. In II. i. 3 there is\r\n‘Music, and a song above’, for a mask.\r\n\r\n[487] _C. Altered_, I. i. 1, ‘Iuniper a Cobler is discouered, sitting\r\nat worke in his shoppe and singing’; IV. v. 1, ‘Enter Iuniper in his\r\nshop singing’.\r\n\r\n[488] _C. A._ I. v. 212; II. i; III. ii, iii, v, ‘Enter Iaques with his\r\ngold and a scuttle full of horse-dung’. ‘_Jaques._ None is within. None\r\nouerlookes my wall’; IV. vii. 62, ‘Onion gets vp into a tree’; V. i.\r\n42. In I. v action passes directly from the door of Farneze to that of\r\nJaques.\r\n\r\n[489] _Malc._ I. i. 11, ‘The discord ... is heard from ... Malevole’s\r\nchamber’ ... (19) ‘Come down, thou rugged cur’ ... (43) ‘Enter Malevole\r\nbelow’.\r\n\r\n[490] _Malc._ V. ii. 163. This transition is both in Q_{1} and Q_{2},\r\nalthough Q_{2} inserts a passage (164–94) here, as well as another\r\n(10–39) earlier in the scene, which entails a contrary transition from\r\nthe palace to the citadel.\r\n\r\n[491] _Dutch C._ has (_a_) Mulligrub’s (I. i; II. iii; III. iii) with\r\naction in a ‘parlour’ (III. iii. 53); (_b_) Franceschina’s (I. ii; II.\r\nii; IV. iii, v; V. i), with action above, probably in a _loggia_ before\r\nFranceschina’s chamber, where she has placed an ambush at V. i. 12,\r\n‘She conceals them behind the curtain’; (_c_) Subboy’s (II. i; III.\r\ni; IV. i, ii, iv; V. ii), with a ring thrown from a window above (II.\r\ni. 56); (_d_) Burnish’s shop (III. ii; V. iii), with an inner and an\r\nouter door, for (III. ii. 1) ‘Enter Master Burnish [&c.] ... Cocledemoy\r\nstands at the other door ... and overhears them’.\r\n\r\n[492] _Soph._ I. ii. 32, ‘The Ladies lay the Princess in a fair bed,\r\nand close the curtains, whilst Massinissa enters’ ... (35) ‘The Boys\r\ndraw the curtains, discovering Sophonisba, to whom Massinissa speaks’\r\n... (235) ‘The Ladies draw the curtains about Sophonisba; the rest\r\naccompany Massinissa forth’.\r\n\r\n[493] _Soph._ III. i. 117, ‘The attendants furnish the altar’....\r\n(162) ‘They lay Vangue in Syphax’ bed and draw the curtains’ ... (167)\r\n_Soph._ ‘Dear Zanthia, close the vault when I am sunk’ ... (170) ‘She\r\ndescends’ ... (207) ‘[Syphax] descends through the vault’.\r\n\r\n[494] _Soph._ IV. i, ‘Enter Sophonisba and Zanthia, as out of a cave’s\r\nmouth’ ... (44) ‘Through the vaut’s mouth, in his night-gown, torch in\r\nhis hand, Syphax enters just behind Sophonisba’.... (126) ‘Erichtho\r\nenters’ ... (192) ‘Infernal music, softly’ ... (202) ‘A treble viol and\r\na base lute play softly within the canopy’ ... (212) ‘A short song to\r\nsoft music above’ ... (215) ‘Enter Erichtho in the shape of Sophonisba,\r\nher face veiled, and hasteth in the bed of Syphax’ ... (216) ‘Syphax\r\nhasteneth within the canopy, as to Sophonisba’s bed’ ... (V. i. 1)\r\n‘Syphax draws the curtains, and discovers Erichtho lying with him’ ...\r\n(24) ‘Erichtho slips into the ground’ ... (29) ‘Syphax kneels at the\r\naltar’ ... (40) ‘Out of the altar the ghost of Asdrubal ariseth’. There\r\nis no obvious break in IV. Erichtho promises to bring Sophonisba with\r\nmusic, and says ‘I go’ (181), although there is no _Exit_. We must\r\nsuppose Syphax to return to his chamber through the vault either here\r\nor after his soliloquy at 192, when the music begins.\r\n\r\n[495] _E. Ho!_, I. i. 1, ‘Enter Maister Touchstone and Quick-silver\r\nat severall dores.... At the middle dore, enter Golding, discovering\r\na gold-smiths shoppe, and walking short turns before it’; II. i. 1,\r\n‘Touchstone, Quick-silver[cf above and below, but Touchstone diff];\r\nGoulding and Mildred sitting on eyther side of the stall’.\r\n\r\n[496] At the end of II. ii, which is before Security’s, with Winifred\r\n‘above’ (241), Quick-silver remains on the stage, for II. iii, before\r\nPetronel’s. The tavern is first used in III. iii, after which III. iv,\r\nof one 7–line speech only, returns to Security’s and ends the act.\r\nBillingsgate should be at some little distance from the other houses.\r\n\r\n[497] _E. Ho!_, IV. i. 1, ‘Enter Slitgut, with a paire of oxe hornes,\r\ndiscovering Cuckolds-Haven above’.\r\n\r\n[498] Clearly IV. i. 346–64 (ed. Schelling) has been misplaced in the\r\nQ_{q}; it is a final speech by Slitgut, with his _Exit_, but without\r\nhis name prefixed, and should come after 296. The new scene begins with\r\n297.\r\n\r\n[499] _E. Ho!_, IV. i. 92, ‘Enter the Drawer in the Taverne before\r\n[i.e. in III. iii], with Wynnyfrid’; he will shelter her at ‘a house\r\nof my friends heere in S. Kath’rines’ ... (297) ‘Enter Drawer, with\r\nWynifrid new attird’, who says ‘you have brought me nere enough your\r\ntaverne’ and ‘my husband stale thither last night’. Security enters\r\n(310) with ‘I wil once more to this unhappy taverne’.\r\n\r\n[500] _Y. F. Gallants_ has (_a_) Frippery’s shop (I. i); (_b_)\r\nKatherine’s (I. ii; V. ii); (_c_) Mitre inn (II. iii); (_d_) Primero’s\r\nbrothel (II. i; III. iv; V. i); (_e_) Tailby’s lodging (IV. i, ii);\r\n(_f_) Fitzgrave’s lodging (IV. iii); (_g_) Mrs. Newcut’s dining-room\r\n(IV. vii); (_h_) Paul’s (IV. vi). There is action within in all these,\r\nand in V. i, which is before (_d_), spies are concealed ‘overhead’\r\n(124).\r\n\r\n[501] In _Isle of Gulls_ the park or forest holds a lodge for the duke\r\n(I. i), a ‘queach of bushes’ (II. ii), Diana’s oak (II. ii; IV. iv),\r\nAdonis’ bower (II. ii; V. i), a bowling green with arbours (II. iii-v),\r\nand the house of Manasses (IV. iii).\r\n\r\n[502] _Law Tricks_ has (_a_) the palace (I. i; II; IV. i, ii; V. ii),\r\nwithin which (p. 64, ed. Bullen) ‘Discover Polymetes in his study’, and\r\n(p. 78) ‘Polymetes in his study’; (_b_) an arrased chamber in Lurdo’s\r\n(III. i), entered by a vault (cf. p. 148, _supra_); (_c_) Countess\r\nLurdo’s (III. ii); (_d_) the cloister vaults (V. i, ii) where (p. 90)\r\n‘Countesse in the Tombe’. Action passes direct from (_a_) to (_d_) at\r\np. 89.\r\n\r\n[503] _Fleir_ has (_a_) the courtesans’ (I. 26–188; II; III. 1–193; IV.\r\n1–193); (_b_) Alunio’s (IV. 194–287); (_c_) Ferrio’s (V. 1–54); (_d_) a\r\nprison (V. 55–87); (_e_) a law court (V. 178–end); (_f_) possibly Susan\r\nand Nan’s (I. 189–500). Conceivably (_c_), (_d_), (_e_) are in some way\r\ncombined: there is action within at (_b_), ‘Enter Signior Alunio the\r\nApothecarie in his shop with wares about him’ (194), (_d_) ‘Enter Lord\r\nPiso ... in prison’ (55), and (_e_); none above.\r\n\r\n[504] The action of _F. Shepherdess_ needs a wood, with rustic cotes\r\nand an altar to Pan (I. ii, iii; V. i, iii), a well (III. i), and a\r\nbower for Clorin (I. i; II. ii; IV. ii, v; V. ii, v), where is hung a\r\ncurtain (V. ii. 109).\r\n\r\n[505] _K. B. P._ I. 230, ‘Enter Rafe like a Grocer in ’s shop, with\r\ntwo Prentices Reading Palmerin of England’; at 341 the action shifts\r\nto Merrithought’s, but the episode at Venturewell’s is said to have\r\nbeen ‘euen in this place’ (422), and clearly the two houses were staged\r\ntogether. Possibly the conduit head on which Ralph sings his May Day\r\nsong (IV. 439) was also part of the permanent setting.\r\n\r\n[506] _K. B. P._ II. 71–438; III. 1–524; IV. 76–151.\r\n\r\n[507] The certain plays are _Epicoene_, _Woman a Weathercock_,\r\n_Insatiate Countess_, and _Revenge of Bussy_. I have noted two unusual\r\ns.ds.: _W. a W._ III. ii, ‘Enter Scudmore ... Scudmore passeth one\r\ndoore, and entereth the other, where Bellafront sits in a Chaire, under\r\na Taffata Canopie’; _Insatiate C._ III. i, ‘Claridiana and Rogero,\r\nbeing in a readiness, are received in at one anothers houses by their\r\nmaids. Then enter Mendoza, with a Page, to the Lady Lentulus window’.\r\nThere is some elaborate action with contiguous rooms in _Epicoene_, IV,\r\nV.\r\n\r\n[508] Cf. pp. 98, 117.\r\n\r\n[509] I have noted bedchamber scenes as ‘perhaps above’ at Paul’s\r\nin _A Mad World, my Masters_ and _A Trick to Catch the Old One_,\r\nbut the evidence is very slight and may be due to careless writing.\r\nIn _A Mad World_, III. ii. 181, Harebrain is said to ‘walke below’;\r\nlater ‘Harebrain opens the door and listens’. In _A Trick_, III. iv.\r\n72, Dampit is told that his bed waits ‘above’, and IV. v is in his\r\nbedchamber.\r\n\r\n[510] Cf. p. 116.\r\n\r\n[511] Cf. _Dr. Dodipoll_, _1 Antonio and Mellida_, _The Fawn_, and\r\n_Bussy d’Ambois_ for Paul’s, and _Sir Giles Goosecap_ and _Fleir_ for\r\nBlackfriars. The early Court plays had similar scenes; cf. p. 43.\r\n\r\n[512] _C. Revels_, ind. 54, ‘First the Title of his Play is _Cynthias\r\nRevels_, as any man (that hath hope to be sau’d by his Booke) can\r\nwitnesse; the Scene _Gargaphia_’; _K. B. P._ ind. 10, ‘Now you call\r\nyour play, The London Marchant. Downe with your Title, boy, downe with\r\nyour Title’. For _Wily Beguiled_, cf. p. 126.\r\n\r\n[513] Duff, xi.\r\n\r\n[514] Ch. ix; cf. _Mediaeval Stage_, ii. 221.\r\n\r\n[515] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 2. ‘Cum priuilegio’ is in the colophons of\r\nRastell’s 1533 prints of _Johan Johan_, _The Pardoner and the Friar_,\r\nand _The Wether_, and ‘Cum priuilegio regali’ in those of his undated\r\n_Gentleness and Nobility_ and _Beauty and Good Properties of Women_.\r\n\r\n[516] _Procl._ 114, 122, 155, 176.

I find ‘Cum priuilegio ad imprimendum solum’ in the colophon of\r\n_Acolastus_ (1540) and in both t.p. and colophon of _Troas_ (1559);\r\nalso ‘Seen and allowed &c.’ in the t.p. of Q_{2} of _Gorboduc_ (_c._\r\n1570), ‘Perused and Alowed’ at the end of _Gammer Gurton’s Needle_\r\n(1575), and ‘Seen and allowed, according to the order appointed in the\r\nQueenes maiesties Injunctions’ in the t.p. of _The Glass of Government_\r\n(1575). Otherwise these precautions became dead letters, so far as\r\nplays were concerned.\r\n\r\n[517] _Procl._ 295 (part only in Wilkins, iv. 1; cf. Pollard, _Sh. F._\r\n7). The ‘daye of the printe’ is in the t.ps. of _Thyestes_ (1560),\r\n_Oedipus_ (1563), _Gordobuc_ (1565), _Four Ps_ (1569), and the colophon\r\nof _Promos and Cassandra_ (1578); the year and month in the t.p.\r\nof _King Darius_ (1565). Earlier printers had given the day in the\r\ncolophons of _Mundus et Infans_ (1522), _Johan Johan_ (1533), and _The\r\nPardoner and the Friar_ (1533).\r\n\r\n[518] Dasent, ii. 312; _Procl._ 395 (text in Hazlitt, _E.

F._ 15; _F. and Q._ 4. Mr. Pollard stresses the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining the hands of six Privy Councillors. Perhaps\r\nthis is somewhat exaggerated. Six was the ordinary quorum of that body,\r\nwhich sat several times a week, while many of its members resided in\r\ncourt, were available for signing documents daily, and did in fact\r\nsign, in sixes, many, such as warrants to the Treasurer of the Chamber,\r\nof no greater moment than licences (cf. ch. ii). The signatures were of\r\ncourse ministerial, and would be given to a licence on the report of an\r\nexpert reader. In any case the _Injunction_ provides alternatives.\r\n\r\n[528] Arber, iii. 690; Pollard, _Sh.

Master Kingston, y^e now master, sayth that\r\nbefore the Decree the master and wardens licensed all, and that when\r\nthey had any Divinity booke of muche importance they would take the\r\nadvise of some 2 or 3 ministers of this towne’.\r\n\r\n[529] The references in the following notes, unless otherwise\r\nspecified, are to the vols. and pages of Arber’s _Transcript_.\r\n\r\n[530] i. 106; ii. 879.\r\n\r\n[531] i. 17, ‘No member or members of this Company shall hereafter\r\nknowingly imprint or cause to be imprinted any book, pamphlet,\r\nportraicture, picture or paper whereunto the law requires a license,\r\nwithout such license as by the law is directed for the imprinting of\r\nthe same (1678)’; 22, ‘By ancient usage of this company, when any book\r\nor copy is duly entred in the register-book of this company, to any\r\nmember or members of this company, such person to whom such entry is\r\nmade, is, and always hath been reputed and taken to be proprietor of\r\nsuch book or copy, and ought to have the sole printing thereof (1681)’;\r\n26, ‘It hath been the ancient usage of the members of this company,\r\nfor the printer or printers, publisher or publishers of all books,\r\npamphlets, ballads, and papers, (except what are granted by letters\r\npattents under the great seal of England) to enter into the publick\r\nregister-book of this company, remaining with the clerk of this company\r\nfor the time being, in his or their own name or names, all books,\r\npamphlets, ballads, and papers whatsoever, by him or them to be printed\r\nor published, before the same book, pamphlet, ballad, or paper is begun\r\nto be printed, to the end that the printer or publisher thereof may be\r\nknown, to justifie whatsoever shall be therein contained, and have no\r\nexcuse for the printing or publishing thereof (1682)’.\r\n\r\n[532] Typical examples are i. 75 (1557–8), ‘To master John Wally these\r\nbokes called Welth and helthe, the treatise of the ffrere and the boy,\r\nstans puer ad mensam, another of youghte charyte and humylyte, an a.\r\nb. c. for cheldren in englesshe with syllabes, also a boke called an\r\nhundreth mery tayles ij^s’; 77 (1557–8), ‘To Henry Sutton to prynte\r\nan enterlude vpon the history of Jacobe and Esawe out of the xxvij\r\nchapeter of the fyrste boke of Moyses called Genyses and for his\r\nlycense he geveth to the howse iiij^d’; 128 (1559–60), ‘Recevyd of John\r\nKynge for his lycense for pryntinge of these copyes Lucas urialis, nyce\r\nwanton, impaciens poverte, the proude wyves pater noster, the squyre\r\nof low degre and syr deggre graunted ye x of June anno 1560 ij^s’. The\r\nlast becomes the normal form, but without the precise date.\r\n\r\n[533] i. 155, 177, 204, 205, 208, 209, 231, 263, 268, 269, 272, 299,\r\n302, 308, 312, 334, 336, 343, 378, 382, 385, 398, 399, 415. It is\r\npossible that the wardens, intent on finance, did not always transcribe\r\ninto their accounts notes of authorizations. Only half a dozen of the\r\nabove are ascribed to the archbishop, yet a mention of ‘one Talbot,\r\nservant of the archbishop of Canterbury, a corrector to the printers’\r\nin an examination relative to the Ridolfi plot (Haynes-Murdin, ii. 30)\r\nshows that he had enough work in 1571 to justify the appointment of a\r\nregular deputy.\r\n\r\n[534] ii. 35, 301. Collins remained clerk to 1613, when he was\r\nsucceeded by Thomas Mountfort, who became a stationer (McKerrow, 196),\r\nand is of course to be distinguished from the prebendary of Paul’s and\r\nHigh Commissioner of a similar name, who acted as ‘corrector’ (cf. p.\r\n168).\r\n\r\n[535] i. 451 _sqq._\r\n\r\n[536] ii. 302, 359, 371, 377, 378, 414, &c.\r\n\r\n[537] ii. 440, 444.\r\n\r\n[538] ii. 334, ‘vnder the hande of Master Recorder’; 341, ‘vnder\r\nthandes of Doctour Redman and the wardens’; 342, ‘master Recorder and\r\nthe wardens’; 346, ‘the lord maiour and the wardens’; 357, ‘sub manibus\r\ncomitum Leicester et Hunsdon’; 372, ‘master Crowley’; 375, ‘master\r\nVaughan’; 386, ‘master Secretary Wilson’; 403, ‘master Thomas Norton\r\n[Remembrancer]’; 404, ‘the Lord Chancellor’; 409, ‘master Cotton’;\r\n417, ‘by aucthoritie from the Counsell’; 434, 435, ‘pervsed by master\r\nCrowley’; 447, ‘master Recorder’. For Talbot, cf. _supra_.\r\n\r\n[539] ii. 304; cf. ii. 447 (1586), ‘Entred by commaundement from master\r\nBarker in wrytinge vnder his hand. Aucthorised vnder the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury his hand’. ‘Licenced’, as well as ‘authorised’ or ‘alowed’,\r\nnow sometimes (ii. 307, 447) describes the action of a prelate or\r\ncorrector.\r\n\r\n[540] ii. 366.\r\n\r\n[541] ii. 428.\r\n\r\n[542] ii. 424, ‘alwaies provided that before he print he shall get the\r\nbishop of London his alowance to yt’; 424, ‘upon condicon he obtaine\r\nthe ordinaries hand thereto’; 429, ‘provyded alwaies and he is enioyned\r\nto gett this booke laufully alowed before he print yt’; 431, ‘yt is\r\ngranted vnto him that if he gett the card of phantasie lawfullie alowed\r\nvnto him, that then he shall enioye yt as his owne copie’; 431, ‘so\r\nit be or shalbe by laufull aucthoritie lycenced vnto him’; 444, ‘to\r\nbe aucthorised accordinge to her maiesties Iniunctions’. The wardens’\r\nhands are not cited to any of these conditional entries.\r\n\r\n[543] ii. 307, 308, 336, 353, 430, 438, 439.\r\n\r\n[544] App. D, No. lxxvii; cf. Strype, _Life of Whitgift_, i. 268;\r\nPierce, _Introduction to Mar Prelate Tracts_, 74. Confirmations\r\nand special condemnations of offending books are in _Procl._ 802,\r\n812, 1092, 1362, 1383 (texts of two last in G. W. Prothero, _Select\r\nStatutes_, 169, 395).\r\n\r\n[545] ii. 459, ‘Master Hartwell certifying it to be tollerated’; 460,\r\n‘authorised or alowed as good vnder thand of Doctour Redman &c.’; 461,\r\n‘certified by Master Hartwell to be alowed leavinge out the ij staues\r\nyat are crossed’; 464, ‘master Crowleys hand is to yt, as laufull to\r\nbe printed’; 475, ‘aucthorised by tharchbishop of Canterbury as is\r\nreported by Master Cosin’; 479, ‘which as master Hartwell certifyithe\r\nby his hande to the written copie, my Lordes grace of Canterbury is\r\ncontent shall passe without anie thinge added to yt before it be\r\npervsed’; 487, ‘sett downe as worthie to be printed vnder thand of\r\nMaster Gravet’; 489, ‘Master Crowleys hand is to yt testyfying it to be\r\nalowable to ye print’; 491, ‘vnder the Bishop of London, Master Abraham\r\nFraunce, and the wardens hands’; 493, ‘Master Hartwells hand beinge at\r\nthe wrytten copie testifyinge his pervsinge of the same’; 493, ‘alowed\r\nvnder D^r Stallers hand as profitable to be printed’, &c.\r\n\r\n[546] Lambe notes (iii. 690) in 1636 that on 30 June 1588, ‘the\r\narchbishop gave power to Doctor Cosin, Doctor Stallard, Doctor Wood,\r\nmaster Hartwell, master Gravett, master Crowley, master Cotton, and\r\nmaster Hutchinson, or any one of them, to license books to be printed:\r\nOr any 2 of those following master Judson, master Trippe, master Cole\r\nand master Dickens’. It will be observed that most of the first group\r\nof these had already acted as ‘correctors’, together with William\r\nRedman and Richard Vaughan, chaplains respectively to Archbishop\r\nGrindal and Bishop Aylmer. William Hutchinson and George Dickens were\r\nalso chaplains to Aylmer. Hutchinson was in the High Commission of\r\n1601. Richard Cosin was Dean of the Arches and a High Commissioner.\r\nAbraham Hartwell was secretary and Cole chaplain (Arber, ii. 494) to\r\nArchbishop Whitgift. Hutchinson, William Gravett, William Cotton,\r\nand George Dickins were or became prebendaries of St. Paul’s. Thomas\r\nStallard was rector of All Hallows’ and St. Mary’s at Hill; Henry Tripp\r\nof St. Faith’s and St. Stephen’s, Walbrook. Most of this information\r\nis from Hennessy. Crowley was presumably Robert Crowley, vicar of St.\r\nGiles, Cripplegate, and himself a stationer, although his activity as\r\na Puritan preacher and pamphleteer makes his appointment an odd one\r\nfor Whitgift. Moreover, he died on 18 June 1588. There may have been\r\ntwo Robert Crowleys, or the archbishop’s list may have been drawn up\r\nearlier than Lambe dates it.\r\n\r\n[547] Amongst the correctors who appear later in the Register are\r\nRichard Bancroft, John Buckeridge, and Michael Murgatroyd, secretaries\r\nor chaplains to Whitgift, Samuel Harsnett, William Barlow, Thomas\r\nMountford, John Flower, and Zacharias Pasfield, prebendaries of St.\r\nPaul’s, William Dix, Peter Lyly, chaplain of the Savoy and brother of\r\nthe dramatist, Lewis Wager, rector of St. James’s, Garlickhithe, and\r\ndramatist, John Wilson, and Gervas Nidd. Mountford and Dix were in the\r\nHigh Commission of 1601. I have not troubled to trace the full careers\r\nof these men in Hennessy and elsewhere. Thomas Morley (Arber, iii. 93)\r\nand William Clowes (ii. 80) seem to have been applied to as specialists\r\non musical and medical books respectively.\r\n\r\n[548] ii. 463, 464, 508, 509, ‘Alowed by the Bishop of London vnder\r\nhis hand and entred by warrant of Master [warden] Denhams hand to the\r\ncopie’.\r\n\r\n[549] A typical entry is now\r\n\r\n                         ‘xiii^{to} die Augusti [1590].\r\nRichard Jones.

A number of satirical books were condemned by name\r\nto be burnt, and direction given to the master and wardens, ‘That no\r\nSatyres or Epigrams be printed hereafter; That noe Englishe historyes\r\nbe printed excepte they bee allowed by some of her maiesties privie\r\nCounsell; That noe playes be printed excepte they bee allowed by suche\r\nas haue aucthoritie; That all Nasshes bookes and Doctor Harvyes bookes\r\nbe taken wheresoeuer they maye be found and that none of theire bookes\r\nbe euer printed hereafter; That thoughe any booke of the nature of\r\ntheise heretofore expressed shalbe broughte vnto yow vnder the hands of\r\nthe Lord Archebisshop of Canterburye or the Lord Bishop of London yet\r\nthe said booke shall not be printed vntill the master or wardens haue\r\nacquainted the said Lord Archbishop or the Lord Bishop with the same to\r\nknowe whether it be theire hand or no’.\r\n\r\n[551] _Hunting of Cupid_ (R. Jones, 26 July 1591), ‘provyded alwayes\r\nthat yf yt be hurtfull to any other copye before lycenced, then this\r\nto be voyde’; _Merchant of Venice_ (J. Robertes, 22 July 1598),\r\n‘prouided, that yt bee not prynted by the said James Robertes or anye\r\nother whatsoeuer without lycence first had from the Right honorable\r\nthe lord chamberlen’; _Blind Beggar of Alexandria_ (W.

And\r\nthen procure the wardens handes to yt for the entrance of yt: He is to\r\nhaue the same for his copy’; _Westward Hoe_ (H. Rocket, 2 March 1605),\r\n‘prouided yat he get further authoritie before yt be printed’ (entry\r\ncrossed out, and marked ‘vacat’); _Dutch Courtesan_ (J. Hodgets, 26\r\nJune 1605), ‘provyded that he gett sufficient aucthoritie before yt be\r\nprynted’ (with later note, ‘This is alowed to be printed by aucthoritie\r\nfrom Master Hartwell’); _Sir Giles Goosecap_ (E.

Busby, 13 May\r\n1606), ‘provided that they are not to printe yt tell they bringe good\r\naucthoritie and licence for the doinge thereof’ (with note to transfer\r\nof Trundle’s share to Busby and A. Johnson on 21 Nov. 1606, ‘This booke\r\nis aucthorised by Sir George Bucke Master Hartwell and the wardens’).\r\n\r\n[552] Buck’s hand first appears to _Claudius Tiberius Nero_ (10 Mar.\r\n1607), and thereafter to all London (but not University) plays up to\r\nhis madness in 1622, except _Cupid’s Whirligig_ (29 June 1607), which\r\nhas Tilney’s, _Yorkshire Tragedy_ (2 May 1608), which has Wilson’s,\r\nsome of those between 4 Oct. 1608 and 10 March 1609, which have\r\nSegar’s, who is described as Buck’s deputy, and _Honest Lawyer_ (14\r\nAug. 1615), which has Taverner’s.\r\n\r\n[553] i. 45, 69, 93, 100, &c.; ii. 821, 843. In 1558–9, only, the\r\nheading is ‘Fynes for defautes for Pryntynge withoute lycense’.\r\n\r\n[554] See the case of Jeffes and White in 1593 given in ch. xxiii, s.v.\r\nKyd, _Spanish Tragedy_.\r\n\r\n[555] i. 93, 100; ii. 853 (21 Jan. 1583), ‘This daye, Ric. Jones is\r\nawarded to paie x^s for a fine for printinge a thinge of the fall of\r\nthe gallories at Paris Garden without licence and against commandement\r\nof the Wardens. And the said Jones and Bartlet to be committed to\r\nprison viz Bartlet for printing it and Jones for sufferinge it to be\r\nprinted in his house’.\r\n\r\n[556] ii. 824, 826, 832, 837, 849, 851.\r\n\r\n[557] ii. 850.\r\n\r\n[558] The testimony only relates strictly to the period 1576–86, which\r\nis nearly coincident with the slack ecclesiastical rule of Archbishop\r\nGrindal (1576–83). Parker (1559–75) may have been stricter, as Whitgift\r\n(1583–1604) certainly was.\r\n\r\n[559] i. 95, ‘Master Waye had lycense to take the lawe of James Gonnell\r\nfor a sarten dett due vnto hym’; 101, ‘Owyn Rogers for ... kepynge of a\r\nforren with out lycense ys fyned’.\r\n\r\n[560] ii. 62.\r\n\r\n[561] i. 322.\r\n\r\n[562] v. lxxvi, ‘we do will and commande yowe that from hence forthe\r\nyowe suffer neither booke ballett nor any other matter to be published\r\n... until the same be first seene and allowed either by us of her\r\nM^{tes} pryvie Counsell or by thee [_sic_] Commissioners for cawses\r\necclesyastical there at London’.\r\n\r\n[563] The fee seems at first to have been 4_d._ for ‘entraunce’ (i.\r\n94), with a further sum for books above a certain size at the rate of\r\n‘euery iij leves a pannye’ (i. 97); plays ran from 4_d._ to 12_d._ But\r\nfrom about 1582 plays and most other books are charged a uniform fee of\r\n6_d._, and only ballads and other trifles escape with 4_d._ Payments\r\nwere sometimes in arrear; often there is no note of fee to a title;\r\nand in some of these cases the words ‘neuer printed’ have been added.\r\nOn the other hand, the receipt of fees is sometimes recorded, and the\r\ntitle remains unentered; at the end of the entries for 1585–6 (ii. 448)\r\nis a memorandum that one of the wardens ‘brought in about iiij^s moore\r\nwhich he had receved for copies yat were not brought to be entred into\r\nthe book this yere’. A similar item is in the wardens’ accounts for\r\n1592–3 (i. 559). Fees were charged for entries of transferred as well\r\nas of new copies.\r\n\r\n[564] Various formulae are used, such as ‘assigned vnto him’ (ii. 310,\r\n351), ‘turned ouer to him’ (ii. 369), ‘putt ouer vnto him’ (ii. 431),\r\n‘sold and sett ouer vnto him’ (ii. 350), ‘which he affyrmeth yat he\r\nbought of’ (ii. 351), ‘by assent of’ (ii. 415), ‘by thappointment of’\r\n(ii. 667), ‘by the consent of’ (ii. 608), ‘which he bought of’ (ii.\r\n325), &c. A transfer of ‘plaiebookes’ from Sampson Awdeley to John\r\nCharlewood on 15 Jan. 1582 (ii. 405) included, besides two plays,\r\n_Youth_ and _Impatient Poverty_, which had been formerly registered,\r\nfour others, _Weather_, _Four Ps_, _Love_, and _Hickscorner_, which\r\nhad been printed before the Register came into existence. I suppose\r\nthat Charlwood secured copyright in these, but was there any copyright\r\nbefore the entry of 1582?\r\n\r\n[565] ii. 377. ‘Tollerated vnto him but not vnder the wardens handes’,\r\n472, ‘beinge broughte to enter by John Woulf without the wardens handes\r\nto the copy’. Even in the seventeenth century ballads are sometimes\r\nentered without any citation of hands, and in 1643 it was the clerk\r\nand not the wardens whom Parliament authorized to license ‘small\r\npamphletts, portratures, pictures, and the like’ (v. liv).\r\n\r\n[566] ii. 365, ‘Translated by a French copie whereat was the bishop of\r\nLondons hand and master Harrisons’; 440, ‘by commaundement from master\r\nwarden Newbery vnder his own handwrytinge on the backside of ye wrytten\r\ncopie’; 443, ‘vnder his hand to the printed copie’; 449, ‘by warrant\r\nof master warden Bisshops hand to the former copie printed anno 1584’;\r\n449, ‘by warrant of master warden Bishops hand to the wrytten copie’;\r\n457, ‘by warrant of the wardens handes to thold copie’; 521, ‘with\r\nmaster Hartwelles hand to the Italyan Booke’; 534, ‘alowed vnder master\r\nHartwelles hand, entred by warrant of the subscription of the wardens’,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[567] ii. 434, ‘entred vpon a special knowen token sent from master\r\nwarden Newbery’; 437, ‘allowed by tharchbishop of Canterbury, by\r\ntestymonie of the Lord Chenie’; 460, ‘by the wardens appointment at the\r\nhall’; 504, ‘by warrant of a letter from Sir Ffrauncis Walsingham to\r\nthe master and wardens of the Cumpanye’; 523, ‘alowed by a letter or\r\nnote vnder master Hartwelles hand’; 524, ‘reported by master Fortescue\r\nto be alowed by the archbishop of Canterbury’; 633, ‘The note vnder\r\nmaster Justice Ffenners hand is layd vp in the wardens cupbord’;\r\niii. 160, ‘John Hardie reporteth that the wardens are consentinge to\r\nthentrance thereof’, &c.\r\n\r\n[568] An inventory of 1560 (i. 143) records ‘The nombre of all suche\r\nCopyes as was lefte in the Cubberde in our Counsell Chambre at the\r\nCompte ... as apereth in the whyte boke for that yere ... xliiij. Item\r\nin ballettes ... vij^e iiij^x and xvj’. From 1576 to 1579 ‘and a copie’\r\nis often added to the notes of fees. The wardens accounts from 1574\r\nto 1596 (i. 470, 581) regularly recite that they had ‘deliuered into\r\nthe hall certen copies which haue been printed this yeare, as by a\r\nparticular booke thereof made appearithe’.\r\n\r\n[569] ii. 452, ‘Receaved of him for printinge 123 ballades which are\r\nfiled vp in the hall with his name to euerie ballad’. The order of\r\n1592 about _Dr. Faustus_ (cf. ch. xxiii) suggests preliminary entry of\r\nclaims in a Hall book distinct from the Clerk’s book.\r\n\r\n[570] ii. 414, ‘Graunted by the Assistants’; 449, ‘entred in full\r\ncourt’; 462, ‘entred in plena curia’; 465, ‘intratur in curia’; 477,\r\n‘by the whole consent of thassistantes’; 535, ‘aucthorysed to him at\r\nthe hall soe that yt doe not belonge to any other of the Cumpanye’;\r\n535, ‘This is allowed by the consent of the whole table’; 663, ‘in open\r\ncourt’; 344, ‘memorandum that this lycence is revoked and cancelled’;\r\n457, ‘This copie is forbydden by the Archbishop of Canterbury’, with\r\nmarginal note ‘Expunctum in plena curia’; 514, ‘so yat he first gett yt\r\nto be laufully and orderly alowed as tollerable to be printed and doo\r\nshewe thaucthoritie thereof at a Court to be holden’; 576, ‘Cancelled\r\nout of the book, for the vndecentnes of it in diuerse verses’; iii. 82,\r\n‘Entred ... in full court ... vppon condicon that yt be no other mans\r\ncopie, and that ... he procure it to be aucthorised and then doo shew\r\nit at the hall to the master and wardens so aucthorised’.\r\n\r\n[571] The register indicates that even at the time of entry the fee\r\nsometimes remained unpaid. But probably it had to be paid before the\r\nstationer could actually publish with full security of copyright.\r\n\r\n[572] Cf. p. 173.\r\n\r\n[573] I note twenty-two cases (1586–1616) in which the earliest print\r\nknown falls in a calendar year later than the next after that of\r\nentry: _Spanish Tragedy_, 1592–4 (N.D. probably earlier); _Soliman\r\nand Perseda_, 1592–9 (N.D. probably earlier); _James IV_, 1594–8;\r\n_Famous Victories_, 1594–8; _David and Bethsabe_, 1594–9; _King Leire_,\r\n1594–1605 (re-entry 1605); _Four Prentices_, 1594–1615 (one or more\r\nearlier editions probable); _Jew of Malta_, 1594–1633 (re-entry 1632);\r\n_Woman in the Moon_, 1595–7; _George a Greene_, 1595–9; _Merchant of\r\nVenice_, 1598–1600 (conditional entry); _Alarum for London_, 1600–2\r\n(conditional entry); _Patient Grissell_, 1600–3 (stayed by Admiral’s);\r\n_Stukeley_, 1600–5; _Dr. Faustus_, 1601–4; _Englishmen for my Money_,\r\n1601–16; _Troilus and Cressida_, 1603–9 (re-entry 1609); _Westward\r\nHo!_, 1605–7 (conditional entry cancelled); _Antony and Cleopatra_,\r\n1608–23, (re-entry 1623); _2 Honest Whore_, 1608–30 (re-entry 1630);\r\n_Epicoene_, 1610–20 (earlier edition probable); _Ignoramus_, 1615–30\r\n(re-entry 1630). The glutting of the book-market in 1594 accounts for\r\nsome of the delays.\r\n\r\n[574] ii. 829 (1599), 833 (1601), 835 (1602), 837 (1603).\r\n\r\n[575] I find no entries of _Enough is as Good as a Feast_ (N.D.),\r\n_Thyestes_ (1560), _Hercules Furens_ (1561), _Trial of Treasure_\r\n(1567), _God’s Promises_ (1577), perhaps reprints; of _Orestes_ (1567);\r\nor of _Abraham’s Sacrifice_ (1577) or _Conflict of Conscience_ (1581),\r\nperhaps entered in 1571–5. The method of exhaustions suggests that\r\nCopland’s _Robin Hood_ (N.D.) is the ‘newe playe called ---- ’ which he\r\nentered on 30 Oct. 1560, and that Colwell’s _Disobedient Child_ (N.D.)\r\nis the unnamed ‘interlude for boyes to handle and to passe tyme at\r\nchristenmas’, which he entered in 1569–70.\r\n\r\n[576] His plays were _Sir Thomas Wyat_ (1607), _Every Woman in her\r\nHumour_ (1609), _Two Maids of Moreclack_ (1609), _Roaring Girl_ (1611),\r\n_White Devil_ (1612), and _Insatiate Countess_ (1613).\r\n\r\n[577] In _Nice Wanton_ a prayer for a king has been altered by\r\nsacrificing a rhyme into one for a queen. The prayer of _Impatient\r\nPoverty_ seems also to have been for Mary and clumsily adapted for\r\nElizabeth. Wager’s _Enough is as Good as a Feast_ may be Elizabethan\r\nor pre-Elizabethan. _Jacob and Esau_ (1568), entered in 1557–8, is\r\npre-Elizabethan.\r\n\r\n[578] Reprints of 1559–85 include Heywood’s _Weather_ and _Four\r\nPs_, printed in England before the establishment of the Stationers’\r\nRegister, and Bale’s _Three Laws_ and _God’s Promises_, printed,\r\nprobably abroad, in 1538. John Walley, who seems to have printed\r\n1545–86, failed to date his books. I cannot therefore say whether his\r\nreprints of the pre-Register _Love_ and _Hickscorner_, or the prints\r\nof _Youth_ and _Wealth and Health_ (if it is his), which he entered in\r\n1557–8, are Elizabethan or not.\r\n\r\n[579] Cf. App. L.\r\n\r\n[580] Cf. App. B. I classify as follows: (a) COMPANIES OF MEN: (i)\r\nMorals (3), _Delight_, _Beauty and Housewifery_, _Love and Fortune_;\r\n(ii) Classical (7), _Tully_, _A Greek Maid_, _Four Sons of Fabius_,\r\n_Sarpedon_, _Telomo_, _Phillida and Corin_, _Rape of the Second Helen_;\r\n(iii) Romantic (17), _Lady Barbara_, _Cloridon and Radiamanta_, _Predor\r\nand Lucia_, _Mamillia_, _Herpetulus the Blue Knight and Perobia_,\r\n_Philemon and Philecia_, _Painter’s Daughter_, _Solitary Knight_,\r\n_Irish Knight_, _Cynocephali_, _Three Sisters of Mantua_, _Knight in\r\nthe Burning Rock_, _Duke of Milan and Marquess of Mantua_, _Portio\r\nand Demorantes_, _Soldan and Duke_, _Ferrar_, _Felix and Philiomena_;\r\n(iv) Farce (1), _The Collier_; (v) Realistic (2), _Cruelty of a\r\nStepmother_, _Murderous Michael_; (vi) Antic Play (1); (vii) Episodes\r\n(2), _Five Plays in One_, _Three Plays in One_; (b) COMPANIES OF\r\nBOYS: (i) Morals (6), _Truth, Faithfulness and Mercy_, ‘_Vanity_’,\r\n_Error_, _Marriage of Mind and Measure_, _Loyalty and Beauty_, _Game\r\nof Cards_; (ii) Classical (12), _Iphigenia_, _Ajax and Ulysses_,\r\n_Narcissus_, _Alcmaeon_, _Quintus Fabius_, _Siege of Thebes_, _Perseus\r\nand Andromeda_, ‘_Xerxes_’, _Mutius Scaevola_, _Scipio Africanus_,\r\n_Pompey_, _Agamemnon and Ulysses_; (iii) Romantic (4), _Paris and\r\nVienna_, _Titus and Gisippus_, _Alucius_, _Ariodante and Genevora_;\r\n(c) UNKNOWN COMPANIES: (i) Morals (5), _As Plain as Can Be_, _Painful\r\nPilgrimage_, _Wit and Will_, _Prodigality_, ‘_Fortune_’; (ii) Classical\r\n(2), _Orestes_, _Theagenes and Chariclea_; (iii) Romantic (1), _King of\r\nScots_; (iv) Farces (2), _Jack and Jill_, _Six Fools_. The moral and\r\nromantic elements meet also in the list of pieces played by companies\r\nof men at Bristol from 1575 to 1579: _The Red Knight_, _Myngo_, _What\r\nMischief Worketh in the Mind of Man_, _The Queen of Ethiopia_, _The\r\nCourt of Comfort_, _Quid pro Quo_ (Murray, ii. 213).\r\n\r\n[581] _Love and Fortune_ was printed in the next period.\r\n\r\n[582] _Mary Magdalen_; _Conflict of Conscience_. ‘Compiled’ goes back\r\nto Bale, Heywood, and Skelton. Earlier still, _Everyman_ is not so much\r\na play as ‘a treatyse ... in maner of a morall playe’.\r\n\r\n[583] The prologue of _Mary Magdalen_ has ‘we haue vsed this feate at\r\nthe uniuersitie’.\r\n\r\n[584] Wynkyn de Worde calls _Mundus et Infans_ a ‘propre newe\r\ninterlude’, and the advertising title-page is well established from the\r\ntime of Rastell’s press.\r\n\r\n[585] _Conflict of Conscience_; cf. _Damon and Pythias_, the prologue\r\nof which, though it had been a Court play, ‘is somewhat altered for\r\nthe proper use of them that hereafter shall haue occasion to plaie it,\r\neither in Priuate, or open Audience’. The castings, for four, five,\r\nor six players, occur in _King Darius_, _Like Will to Like_, _Longer\r\nThou Livest_, _Mary Magdalen_, _New Custom_, _Tide Tarrieth for No\r\nMan_, _Trial of Treasure_, _Conflict of Conscience_. I find a later\r\nexample from the public stage in _Fair Maid of the Exchange_, which\r\nhas ‘Eleauen may easily acte this comedie’, and a division of parts\r\naccordingly. There are pre-Elizabethan precedents, while _Jack Juggler_\r\nis ‘for Chyldren to playe’, the songs in _Ralph Roister Doister_ are\r\nfor ‘those which shall vse this Comedie or Enterlude’, and _The Four\r\nElements_ has directions for reducing the time of playing at need from\r\nan hour and a half to three-quarters of an hour, and the note ‘Also yf\r\nye lyst ye may brynge in a dysgysynge’. Similarly _Robin Hood_ is ‘for\r\nto be played in Maye games’. That books were in fact bought to act from\r\nis shown by entries in the accounts of Holy Trinity, Bungay, for 1558\r\nof 4_d._ for ‘the interlude and game booke’ and 2_s._ for ‘writing the\r\npartes’ (_M. S._ ii. 343). A book costing only 4_d._ must clearly have\r\nbeen a print.\r\n\r\n[586] There are prayers in _All for Money_, _Apius and Virginia_,\r\n_Common Conditions_, _Damon and Pythias_, _Disobedient Child_ (headed\r\n‘The Players ... kneele downe’), _King Darius_, _Like Will to Like_,\r\n_Longer Thou Livest_, _New Custom_, _Trial of Treasure_ (epilogue\r\nheaded ‘Praie for all estates’). _Mary Magdalen_ and _Tide Tarrieth\r\nfor No Man_ substitute a mere expression of piety. I do not agree with\r\nFleay, 57, that such prayers are evidence of Court performance. The\r\nreverence and epilogue to the Queen in the belated moral of _Liberality\r\nand Prodigality_ (1602), 1314, is different in tone. _The Pedlar’s\r\nProphecy_, also belated as regards date of print, adds to the usual\r\nprayer for Queen and council ‘And that honorable T. N. &c. of N.\r\nchiefly: Whom as our good Lord and maister, found we haue’. No doubt\r\nany strolling company purchasing the play would fill up the blanks to\r\nmeet their own case. Probably both the Queen and estates and the ‘lord’\r\nof a company were prayed for, whether present or absent, so long as the\r\ncustom lasted; cf. ch. x, p. 311; ch. xviii, p. 550.\r\n\r\n[587] Cf. e. g. _Mary Magdalen_ (which refers on the title-page to\r\nthose who ‘heare or read the same’), 56, 1479, 1743; _Like Will to\r\nLike_, sig. C, ‘He ... speaketh the rest as stammering as may be’, C\r\nij, ‘Haunce sitteth in the chaire, and snorteth as though he were fast\r\na sleep’, E ij^v, ‘Nichol Newfangle lieth on the ground groning’, &c.,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[588] _Three Ladies of London_ (1584), _Three Lords and Three Ladies of\r\nLondon_ (1590), _Pedlar’s Prophecy_ (1595), _Contention of Liberality\r\nand Prodigality_ (1602). _Lingua_ (1607) is a piece of academic\r\narchaism. I cannot believe that the manuscript fragment of _Love\r\nFeigned and Unfeigned_ belongs to the seventeenth century. Of course\r\nthere are moral elements in other plays, such as _Histriomastix_,\r\nespecially in dumb-shows and inductions.\r\n\r\n[589] There is little evidence as to the price at which prints were\r\nsold; what there is points to 6_d._ for a quarto. A ‘testerne’ is\r\ngiven in the epistle as the price of _Troilus and Cressida_, and in\r\nMiddleton, _Mayor of Quinborough_, v. i, come thieves who ‘only take\r\nthe name of country comedians to abuse simple people with a printed\r\nplay or two, which they bought at Canterbury for sixpence’. The\r\nstatement that the First Folio cost £1 only rests on Steevens’s report\r\nof a manuscript note in a copy not now known; cf. McKerrow in _Sh.\r\nEngland_, ii. 229.\r\n\r\n[590] Cf. ch. xxiii, s.v. Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n[591] Cf. App. L. In the above allocation _Leir_ and _Satiromastix_, to\r\neach of which two companies have equal claims, are counted twice.\r\n\r\n[592] Greg, _Henslowe_, ii. 148, gives a full list; cf. ch. xiii, s.vv.\r\nQueen’s, Sussex’s, Strange’s, Admiral’s, Pembroke’s, Worcester’s.\r\n\r\n[593] Cf. App. M. Can Moseley have been trying in some way to secure\r\nplays of which he possessed manuscripts from being _acted_ without his\r\nconsent? On 30 Aug. 1660 (_Variorum_, iii. 249; Herbert, 90) he wrote\r\nto Sir Henry Herbert, denying that he had ever agreed with the managers\r\nof the Cockpit and Whitefriars that they ‘should act any playes that\r\ndoe belong to mee, without my knowledge and consent had and procured’.\r\n\r\n[594] Printed from _Addl. MS._ 27632, f. 43, by F. J. Furnivall in _7\r\nN. Q._ (1890), ix. 382. Harington died in 1612. An earlier leaf (30)\r\nhas the date ‘29^{th} of Jan. 1609’. The latest datable play in the\r\ncollection is _The Turk_ (1610, S. R. 10 Mar. 1609). There are four out\r\nof six plays printed in 1609, as well as _The Faithful Shepherdess_\r\n(N.D.), of which on this evidence we can reasonably put the date of\r\npublication in 1609 or 1610.\r\n\r\n[595] Cf. ch. xxiii, s.v. Heywood.\r\n\r\n[596] _M. S. C._ i. 364; _Variorum_, iii. 159. The King’s men played\r\n_The Malcontent_, probably after its first issue in 1604, as a retort\r\nfor the appropriation of _Jeronimo_ by its owners, the Queen’s Revels.\r\nThe earliest extant print of _1 Jeronimo_ is 1605, but the play, which\r\nis not in S. R., may have been printed earlier. The Chapel boys seem\r\nto have revived one at least of Lyly’s old Paul’s plays in 1601. The\r\nChamberlain’s adopted _Titus Andronicus_, which had been Sussex’s, and\r\nShakespeare revised for them _Taming of A Shrew_ and _The Contention_,\r\nwhich had been Pembroke’s, and based plays which were new from the\r\nliterary, and in the case of the last also from the publisher’s,\r\nstandpoint on the _Troublesome Reign of John_ and the _Famous Victories\r\nof Henry V_, which had been the Queen’s, and upon _King Leir_. But of\r\ncourse Sussex’s, Pembroke’s, and the Queen’s had broken.\r\n\r\n[597] Henslowe, i. 119.\r\n\r\n[598] A single printer, Thomas Creede, entered or printed ten plays\r\nbetween 1594 and 1599, all of which he probably acquired in 1594,\r\nalthough he could not get them all in circulation at once. These\r\ninclude four (_T. T. of Rich. III_, _Selimus_, _Famous Victories_,\r\n_Clyomon and Clamydes_) from the Queen’s; it is therefore probable that\r\nsome of those on whose t.ps. no company is named (_Looking Glass_,\r\n_Locrine_, _Pedlar’s Prophecy_, _James IV_, _Alphonsus_) were from the\r\nsame source. The tenth, _Menaechmi_, was not an acting play.\r\n\r\n[599] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 44; cf. ch. ix.\r\n\r\n[600] The Folio editors of Shakespeare condemn the Quartos, or some\r\nof them, as ‘stolne, and surreptitious copies’; ‘piratical’, although\r\nfreely used by Mr. Pollard and others, is not a very happy term, since\r\nno piracy of copyright is involved. The authorized Q_{2} of _Roxana_\r\n(1632) claims to be ‘a plagiarii unguibus vindicata’.\r\n\r\n[601] Introduction, xxxvi of his edition.\r\n\r\n[602] R. B. McKerrow in _Bibl. Soc. Trans._ xii. 294; J. D. Wilson,\r\n_The Copy for Hamlet 1603 and the Hamlet Transcript 1593_ (1918).\r\n\r\n[603] C. Dewischeit, _Shakespeare und die Stenographie_\r\n(_Sh.-Jahrbuch_, xxxiv. 170); cf. Lee, 113, quoting Sir G. Buck’s\r\n_Third Universitie of England_ (1612; cf. ch. iii), ‘They which know it\r\n[brachygraphy] can readily take a Sermon, Oration, Play, or any long\r\nspeech, as they are spoke, dictated, acted, and uttered in the instant’.\r\n\r\n[604] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 48; _F. and Q._ 64. More recently A. W.\r\nPollard and J. D. Wilson have developed a theory (_T. L. S._ Jan.–Aug.\r\n1919) that the ‘bad quartos’ rest upon pre-Shakespearian texts partly\r\nrevised by Shakespeare, of which shortened transcripts had been made\r\nfor a travelling company in 1593, and which had been roughly adapted\r\nby an actor-reporter so as to bring them into line with the later\r\nShakespearian texts current at the time of publication. Full discussion\r\nof this theory belongs to a study of Shakespeare. The detailed\r\napplication of it in J. D. Wilson, _The Copy for Hamlet 1603 and the\r\nHamlet Transcript 1593_ (1918), does not convince me that Shakespeare\r\nhad touched the play in 1593, although I think that the reporter was in\r\na position to make some slight use of a pre-Shakespearian _Hamlet_. And\r\nalthough travelling companies were doubtless smaller than the largest\r\nLondon companies (cf. chh. xi and xiii, s.v. Pembroke’s), there is no\r\nexternal evidence that special ‘books’ were prepared for travelling.\r\nFor another criticism of the theory, cf. W. J. Lawrence in _T. L.\r\nS._ for 21 Aug. 1919. Causes other than travelling might explain the\r\nshortening of play texts: prolixity, even in an experienced dramatist\r\n(cf. t.p. of _Duchess of Malfi_), the approach of winter afternoons, an\r\nincreased popular demand for jigs.\r\n\r\n[605] Cf. G. Wither, _Schollers Purgatory_ (_c._ 1625), 28, ‘Yea, by\r\nthe lawes and Orders of their Corporation, they can and do setle upon\r\nthe particuler members thereof a perpetuall interest in such Bookes\r\nas are Registred by them at their Hall, in their several Names: and\r\nare secured in taking the ful benefit of those books, better then any\r\nAuthor can be by vertue of the Kings Grant, notwithstanding their first\r\nCoppies were purloyned from the true owner, or imprinted without his\r\nleave’.\r\n\r\n[606] Pollard, _F. and Q._ 10. Mr. Pollard seems to suggest (_F. and\r\nQ._ 3) that copyright in a printed book did not hold as against the\r\nauthor. He cites the case of Nashe’s _Pierce Pennilesse_, but there\r\nseems no special reason to assume that in this case, or in those of\r\n_Gorboduc_ and _Hamlet_, the authorized second editions were not made\r\npossible by an arrangement, very likely involving blackmail, with the\r\npirate.\r\n\r\n[607] Letter in Grosart, _Poems of Sidney_ (1877), i. xxiii. Pollard,\r\n_F. and Q._ 8, says that on other occasions Sidney’s friends approached\r\nthe Lord Treasurer and the Star Chamber.\r\n\r\n[608] Pollard, _F. and Q._ 7, 11. I am not sure that the appearance\r\nof Bacon’s name can be regarded as a recognition of the principle of\r\nauthor’s copyright. He may have been already in the High Commission; he\r\nwas certainly in that of 1601.\r\n\r\n[609] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 49, 51, speaks of Burby as ‘regaining the\r\ncopyright’ by his publications, and as, moreover, saving his sixpences\r\n‘as a license was only required for new books’. But surely there was\r\nno copyright, as neither Danter nor Burby paid for an entry. I take\r\nit that when, on 22 Jan. 1607, _R. J._ and _L. L. L._ were entered to\r\nNicholas Ling, ‘by direccõn of a Court and with consent of Master Burby\r\nin wrytinge’, the entry of the transfer secured the copyright for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n[610] Arber, iii. 37. The ink shows that there are two distinct entries.\r\n\r\n[611] Fleay, _L. and W._ 40; Furness, _Much Ado_, ix.\r\n\r\n[612] Pollard, _F. and Q._ 66; _Sh. F._ 44.\r\n\r\n[613] Roberts did not print the 1603 _Hamlet_, although he did that\r\nof 1604; but it must have been covered by his entry of 1602, and this\r\nmakes it a little difficult to regard him (or Blount in 1609) as the\r\n‘agent’ of the Chamberlain’s.\r\n\r\n[614] Pollard, _F. and Q._ 66; _Sh. F._ 45.\r\n\r\n[615] There are analogies in _Taming of the Shrew_, _2, 3 Henry VI_,\r\nand _King John_, which were not entered in S. R. with the other\r\nunprinted plays in 1623, and were probably regarded as covered by\r\ncopyright in the plays on which they were based, although, as a matter\r\nof fact, the _Troublesome Reign_ was itself not entered.\r\n\r\n[616] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 53.\r\n\r\n[617] They had risks to run. The Star Chamber fined and imprisoned\r\nWilliam Buckner, late chaplain to the archbishop, for licensing\r\nPrynne’s _Histriomastix_ in 1633 (Rushworth, _Historical Collections_,\r\nii. 234).\r\n\r\n[618] _M. S. C._ i. 364; _Variorum_, iii. 159.\r\n\r\n[619] Moseley’s _Epistle_ to F_{1} (1647) of Beaumont and Fletcher\r\nsays, ‘When these _Comedies_ and _Tragedies_ were presented on the\r\nStage, the _Actours_ omitted some _Scenes_ and Passages (with the\r\n_Authour’s_ consent) as occasion led them; and when private friends\r\ndesir’d a Copy, they then (and justly too) transcribed what they Acted’.\r\n\r\n[620] See _Epistles_ to Armin, _Two Maids of Moreclack_; Chapman,\r\n_Widow’s Tears_; Heywood, _Rape of Lucrece_, _Golden Age_; Marston,\r\n_Malcontent_; Middleton, _Family of Love_.\r\n\r\n[621] Jonson, _E. M. O._ (1600), ‘As it was first composed by the\r\nAuthor B. I. Containing more than hath been publikely spoken or acted’;\r\nBarnes, _Devil’s Charter_ (1607), ‘As it was plaide.... But more\r\nexactly reuewed, corrected, and augmented since by the Author, for the\r\nmore pleasure and profit of the Reader’; Webster, _Duchess of Malfi_\r\n(1623), ‘with diuerse things Printed, that the length of the Play would\r\nnot beare in the Presentment’.\r\n\r\n[622] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 57; _F. and Q._ 117.\r\n\r\n[623] The editors of the Shakespeare F_{1} claim that they are\r\nreplacing ‘stolne, and surreptitious copies’ by plays ‘absolute in\r\ntheir numbers, as he conceiued them’, and that ‘wee haue scarse\r\nreceiued from him a blot in his papers’; and those of the Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher F_{1} say they ‘had the Originalls from such as received\r\nthem from the Authors themselves’ and lament ‘into how many hands the\r\nOriginalls were dispersed’. The same name ‘original’ was used for the\r\nauthoritative copy of a civic miracle-play; cf. _Mediaeval Stage_, ii.\r\n143.\r\n\r\n[624] The manuscripts of _Sir John Barnevelt_ (_Addl. MS._ 18653),\r\n_Believe As You List_ (_Egerton MS._ 2828), _The Honest Man’s Fortune_\r\n(_Dyce MS._ 9), _The Faithful Friends_ (_Dyce MS._ 10), and _The\r\nSisters_ (_Sion College MS._) appear to be play-house copies, with\r\nlicensing corrections, and in some cases the licences endorsed, and\r\nsome of them may be in the authors’ autographs; cf. Pollard, _Sh.\r\nF._ 59; Mönkemeyer, 72. Several of the copies in _Egerton MS._ 1994,\r\ndescribed by F. S. Boas in _3 Library_ (July 1917), including that of\r\n_1 Richard II_, are of a similar type.\r\n\r\n[625] Sir Henry Herbert noted in his office-book in 1633 (_Variorum_,\r\niii. 208), ‘The Master ought to have copies of their new playes\r\nleft with him, that he may be able to shew what he hath allowed or\r\ndisallowed’, but it was clearly not the current practice. In 1640\r\n(_Variorum_, iii. 241) he suppressed an unlicensed play, and noted,\r\n‘The play I cald for, and, forbiddinge the playinge of it, keepe the\r\nbooke’, which suggests that only one copy existed.\r\n\r\n[626] Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, 155, prints it; cf. _1 Antonio and\r\nMellida_, ind. 1, ‘Enter ... with parts in their hands’; _Wily\r\nBeguiled_, prol. 1, ‘Where are these paltrie Plaiers? stil poaring in\r\ntheir papers and neuer perfect?’ By derivation, the words assigned\r\nto an actor became his ‘part’; cf. Dekker, _News from Hell_ (1606,\r\n_Works_, ii. 144), ‘with pittifull action, like a Plaier, when hees out\r\nof his part’.\r\n\r\n[627] In 1623 Herbert re-allowed _The Winter’s Tale_, ‘thogh the\r\nallowed booke was missinge’, and in 1625 _The Honest Man’s Fortune_,\r\n‘the originall being lost’ (_Variorum_, iii. 229).\r\n\r\n[628] Cf. App. N.\r\n\r\n[629] The handing over of ‘papers’ is referred to in several letters to\r\nHenslowe; cf. _Henslowe Papers_, 56, 69, 75, 76, 81, 82.\r\n\r\n[630] He sends Henslowe an instalment ‘fayr written’, and on another\r\noccasion says, ‘I send you the foule sheet and y^e fayr I was wrighting\r\nas your man can testify’ (_Henslowe Papers_, 72, 78).\r\n\r\n[631] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 62.\r\n\r\n[632] _Birth of Hercules_, 3, ‘Notae marginales inseruiant dirigendae\r\nhistrion[ic]ae’; Nashe, _Summer’s Last Will and Testament_, 1813, ‘You\r\nmight haue writ in the margent of your play-booke, Let there be a fewe\r\nrushes laide in the place where _Back-winter_ shall tumble, for feare\r\nof raying his cloathes: or set downe, Enter _Back-winter_, with his boy\r\nbringing a brush after him, to take off the dust if need require. But\r\nyou will ne’re haue any wardrobe wit while you live. I pray you holde\r\nthe booke well, that we be not _non plus_ in the latter end of the\r\nplay.’\r\n\r\n[633] ‘Exit’ and ‘Exeunt’ soon became the traditional directions for\r\nleaving the stage, but I find ‘Exite omnes’ in Peele, _Edw. I_, 1263.\r\n\r\n[634] Mönkemeyer, 73.\r\n\r\n[635] _T. N. K._ I. iii. 69, ‘2 Hearses ready with Palamon: and Arcite:\r\nthe 3 Queenes. Theseus: and his Lordes ready’, i.e. ready for I. iv,\r\nwhich begins 42 lines later; and again I. iv. 29, ‘3 Hearses ready’,\r\nfor I. v, beginning 24 lines later. So too _Bussy D’Ambois_ (1641, not\r\n1607 ed.), I. i. 153, ‘Table, Chesbord and Tapers behind the Arras’,\r\nready for I. ii.\r\n\r\n[636] _A Shrew_, ind. i, ‘San.’ for speaker; _The Shrew_ (F_{1}), ind.\r\ni. 88, ‘Sincklo’ for speaker; _3 Hen. VI_ (F_{1}), I. ii. 48, ‘Enter\r\nGabriel’; III. i. 1, ‘Enter Sinklo, and Humfrey’; _R. J._ (Q_{2}), IV.\r\nv. 102, ‘Enter Will Kemp’; _M. N. D._ (F_{1}), V. i. 128, ‘Tawyer with\r\na Trumpet before them’; _1 Hen. IV_ (Q_{1}), I. ii. 182 (text, not\r\ns.d.), ‘Falstaffe, Haruey, Rossill, and Gadshil, shall rob those men\r\nthat we haue already waylaid’ (cf. II. ii); _2 Hen. IV_ (Q_{1}), V. iv.\r\n1, ‘Enter Sincklo and three or foure officers’; _M. Ado_ (F_{1}), II.\r\niii. 38, ‘Enter Prince, Leonato, Claudio and Iacke Wilson’; _M. Ado_ (Q\r\nand F), IV. ii, ‘Cowley’ and ‘Kemp’ for speakers; _T.N.K._ v. 3, ‘T.\r\nTucke: Curtis’, IV. ii. 75, ‘Enter Messenger, Curtis’; _1 Antonio and\r\nMellida_, IV. i. 30, ‘Enter Andrugio, Lucio, Cole, and Norwood’; for\r\nother examples, cf. pp. 227, 271, 285, 295, 330, and vol. iv, p. 43.\r\nThe indications of speakers by the letters E. and G. in _All’s Well_,\r\nII. i; III. i, ii, vi, may have a similar origin. The names of actors\r\nare entered in the ‘plots’ after those of the characters represented\r\n(cf. _Henslowe Papers_, 127).\r\n\r\n[637] _Alphonsus_, prol. 1, ‘after you haue sounded thrise’; 1938,\r\n‘Exit Venus. Or, if you can conueniently, let a chaire come down from\r\nthe top of the stage’; _James IV_, 1463, ‘Enter certaine Huntsmen,\r\nif you please, singing’; 1931, ‘Enter, from the widdowes house, a\r\nseruice, musical songs of marriages, or a maske, or what prettie\r\ntriumph you list’; _Three Lords and Three Ladies of London_, sig. C,\r\n‘Here Simp[licitie] sings first, and Wit after, dialoguewise, both to\r\nmusicke if ye will’; _Locrine_, I. i. 1, ‘Let there come foorth a Lion\r\nrunning after a Beare or any other beast’; _Death of R. Hood_, III. ii,\r\n‘Enter or aboue [Hubert, Chester]’; _2 Hen. VI_, IV. ii. 33, ‘Enter\r\nCade [etc.] with infinite numbers’; IV. ix. 9, ‘Enter Multitudes with\r\nHalters about their Neckes’; _T. A._ I. i. 70, ‘as many as can be’;\r\n_Edw. I_, 50, ‘Enter ... and others as many as may be’; _Sir T. More_,\r\nsc. ix. 954, ‘Enter ... so many Aldermen as may’; _What You Will_, v.\r\n193, ‘Enter as many Pages with torches as you can’.\r\n\r\n[638] Mönkemeyer, 63, 91.\r\n\r\n[639] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 79.\r\n\r\n[640] e.g. _R. J._ (Q_{1}), III. i. 94, ‘Tibalt vnder Romeos arme\r\nthrusts Mercutio in and flyes’; III. ii. 32, ‘Enter Nurse wringing her\r\nhands, with the ladder of cordes in her lap’; IV. v. 95, ‘They all but\r\nthe Nurse goe foorth, casting Rosemary on her and shutting the Curtens’.\r\n\r\n[641] Cf. ch. xxi, pp. 133, 136.\r\n\r\n[642] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 71; Van Dam and Stoffel, _William Shakespeare,\r\nProsody and Text_, 274; _Chapters on English Printing, Prosody, and\r\nPronunciation_.\r\n\r\n[643] R. B. McKerrow, introd. xiv, to Barnes, _Devil’s Charter_.\r\n\r\n[644] Pollard, _Sh. F._ 74; cf. his introd. to _A New Shakespeare\r\nQuarto_ (1916).\r\n\r\n[645] Epistles to Heywood, _Rape of Lucrece_; Marston, _Malcontent_,\r\n_Fawn_; Middleton, _Family of Love_. In _Father Hubburd’s Tales_\r\nMiddleton says, ‘I never wished this book a better fortune than to\r\nfall into the hands of a truespelling printer’. Heywood, in an Epistle\r\nto _Apology for Actors_ (1612), praises the honest workmanship of\r\nhis printer, Nicholas Okes, as against that of W. Jaggard, who would\r\nnot let him issue _errata_ of ‘the infinite faults escaped in my\r\nbooke of _Britaines Troy_, by the negligence of the Printer, as the\r\nmisquotations, mistaking of sillables, misplacing halfe lines, coining\r\nof strange and neuer heard of words’.\r\n\r\n[646] ‘Proofs’ and ‘revises’ had come into use before 1619, for\r\nJaggard, criticized by Ralph Brooke for his ill printing of Brooke’s\r\n_Catalogue of Nobility_ (1619), issued a new edition as _A Discoverie\r\nof Errors in the First Edition of the Catalogue of Nobility_ (1622),\r\nregretting that his workmen had not given Brooke leave to print his own\r\nfaulty English, and saying, ‘In the time of this his vnhappy sicknesse,\r\nthough hee came not in person to ouer-looke the Presse, yet the Proofe,\r\nand Reuiewes duly attended him, and he perused them (as is well to be\r\niustifyed) in the maner he did before’; cf. p. 261.\r\n\r\n[647] Cf. pp. 106, 107, 117, 127.\r\n\r\n[648] e.g. _Cynthia’s Revels_ (F_{1}), ‘The Scene Gargaphie’;\r\n_Philaster_ (F_{2}), ‘The scene being in Cicilie’; _Coxcomb_ (F_{2}),\r\n‘The Scene; England, France’ (but in fact there are no scenes in\r\nFrance!).\r\n\r\n[649] _The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom_ has no acts, but nine scenes.\r\nThe latish _Jacob and Esau_, _Respublica_, _Misogonus_, _Conflict of\r\nConscience_ have acts and scenes.\r\n\r\n[650] _Ralph Roister Doister_, _Gammer Gurton’s Needle_, _Gorboduc_,\r\n_Gismund of Salerne_, _Misfortunes of Arthur_, _Jocasta_, _Supposes_,\r\n_Bugbears_, _Two Italian Gentlemen_, _Glass of Government_, _Promos\r\nand Cassandra_, _Arraignment of Paris_; so, too, as a rule, University\r\nplays. _Dido_ and _Love and Fortune_, like the later private theatre\r\nplays, show acts only.\r\n\r\n[651] _Devil’s Charter_, _Duchess of Malfi_, _Philotas_, _Sir Giles\r\nGoosecap_, _The Turk_, _Liberality and Prodigality_, Percy’s plays,\r\n_The Woman Hater_, _Monsieur Thomas_, _2 Antonio and Mellida_.\r\n\r\n[652] Acts and scenes are marked in _Tamburlaine_ and _Locrine_; acts,\r\nor one or more of them only, sometimes with the first scene, in _Jack\r\nStraw_, _Battle of Alcazar_, _Wounds of Civil War_, _King Leire_,\r\n_Alphonsus_, _James IV_, _Soliman and Perseda_, _Spanish Tragedy_,\r\n_John a Kent and John a Cumber_; a few scenes without acts in _Death\r\nof Robin Hood_. These exceptions may indicate neo-classic sympathies\r\nin the earlier group of scholar playwrights; some later plays, e.g. of\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher, have partial divisions. The acts in _Spanish\r\nTragedy_ and _Jack Straw_ are four only; _Histriomastix_, a private\r\ntheatre play, has six. Where there are no formal divisions, they are\r\nsometimes replaced by passages of induction or dumb-shows.\r\n\r\n[653] Cf. ch. xxi.\r\n\r\n[654] Pollard, _F. and Q._ 124; _Sh.

R. on 11\r\nJune 1587 (Arber, ii. 471), but the first extant edition of 1591 was\r\nprobably the first published, and the use of the term ‘Martinize’ in\r\nthe preface dates it as at least post-1589 (cf.
