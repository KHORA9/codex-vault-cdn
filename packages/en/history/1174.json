Dakyns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Xenophon the Athenian was born 431 B.C. He was a\r\n          pupil of Socrates. He marched with the Spartans,\r\n          and was exiled from Athens. Sparta gave him land\r\n          and property in Scillus, where he lived for many\r\n          years before having to move once more, to settle\r\n          in Corinth. He died in 354 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Hellenica is his chronicle of the history of\r\n          the Hellenes from 411 to 359 B.C., starting as a\r\n          continuation of Thucydides, and becoming his own\r\n          brand of work from Book III onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARER'S NOTE\r\n\r\nThis was typed from Dakyns' series, \"The Works of Xenophon,\" a\r\nfour-volume set.

A few days later\r\nThymochares arrived from Athens with a few ships, when another sea fight\r\nbetween the Lacedaemonians and Athenians at once took place, in which\r\nthe former, under the command of Agesandridas, gained the victory.\r\n\r\n (1) Lit. \"after these events\"; but is hard to conjecture to what\r\n    events the author refers. For the order of events and the\r\n    connection between the closing chapter of Thuc. viii. 109, and the\r\n    opening words of the \"Hellenica,\" see introductory remarks above.\r\n    The scene of this sea-fight is, I think, the Hellespont.\r\n\r\nAnother short interval brings us to a morning in early winter, when\r\nDorieus, the son of Diagoras, was entering the Hellespont with fourteen\r\nships from Rhodes at break of day. The Athenian day-watch descrying him,\r\nsignalled to the generals, and they, with twenty sail, put out to sea to\r\nattack him. Dorieus made good his escape, and, as he shook himself free\r\nof the narrows, (2) ran his triremes aground off Rhoeteum. When the\r\nAthenians had come to close quarters, the fighting commenced, and was\r\nsustained at once from ships and shore, until at length the Athenians\r\nretired to their main camp at Madytus, having achieved nothing.\r\n\r\n (2) Lit. \"as he opened\" {os enoige}. This is still a mariner's phrase\r\n    in modern Greek, if I am rightly informed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mindarus, while sacrificing to Athena at Ilium, had observed\r\nthe battle. He at once hastened to the sea, and getting his own triremes\r\nafloat, sailed out to pick up the ships with Dorieus. The Athenians on\r\ntheir side put out to meet him, and engaged him off Abydos. From early\r\nmorning till the afternoon the fight was kept up close to the shore.\r\n(3) Victory and defeat hung still in even balance, when Alcibiades\r\ncame sailing up with eighteen ships. Thereupon the Peloponnesians\r\nfled towards Abydos, where, however, Pharnabazus brought them timely\r\nassistance. (4) Mounted on horseback, he pushed forward into the sea as\r\nfar as his horse would let him, doing battle himself, and encouraging\r\nhis troopers and the infantry alike to play their parts. Then the\r\nPeloponnesians, ranging their ships in close-packed order, and drawing\r\nup their battle line in proximity to the land, kept up the fight. At\r\nlength the Athenians, having captured thirty of the enemy's vessels\r\nwithout their crews, and having recovered those of their own which\r\nthey had previously lost, set sail for Sestos. Here the fleet, with the\r\nexception of forty vessels, dispersed in different directions outside\r\nthe Hellespont, to collect money; while Thrasylus, one of the generals,\r\nsailed to Athens to report what had happened, and to beg for a\r\nreinforcement of troops and ships. After the above incidents,\r\nTissaphernes arrived in the Hellespont, and received a visit from\r\nAlcibiades, who presented him with a single ship, bringing with him\r\ntokens of friendship and gifts, whereupon Tissaphernes seized him and\r\nshut him up in Sardis, giving out that the king's orders were to go to\r\nwar with the Athenians. Thirty days later Alcibiades, accompanied by\r\nMantitheus, who had been captured in Caria, managed to procure horses\r\nand escaped by night to Clazomenae.\r\n\r\n (3) The original has a somewhat more poetical ring. The author uses\r\n    the old Attic or Ionic word {eona}. This is a mark of style, of\r\n    which we shall have many instances. One might perhaps produce\r\n    something of the effect here by translating: \"the battle hugged\r\n    the strand.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"came to their aid along the shore.\"\r\n\r\nB.C. 410. And now the Athenians at Sestos, hearing that Mindarus was\r\nmeditating an attack upon them with a squadron of sixty sail, gave\r\nhim the slip, and under cover of night escaped to Cardia. Hither also\r\nAlcibiades repaired from Clazomenae, having with him five triremes and\r\na light skiff; but on learning that the Peloponnesian fleet had left\r\nAbydos and was in full sail for Cyzicus, he set off himself by land to\r\nSestos, giving orders to the fleet to sail round and join him there.\r\nPresently the vessels arrived, and he was on the point of putting out to\r\nsea with everything ready for action, when Theramenes, with a fleet of\r\ntwenty ships from Macedonia, entered the port, and at the same instant\r\nThrasybulus, with a second fleet of twenty sail from Thasos, both\r\nsquadrons having been engaged in collecting money. Bidding these\r\nofficers also follow him with all speed, as soon as they had taken out\r\ntheir large sails and cleared for action, Alcibiades set sail himself\r\nfor Parium. During the following night the united squadron, consisting\r\nnow of eighty-six vessels, stood out to sea from Parium, and reached\r\nProconnesus next morning, about the hour of breakfast. Here they learnt\r\nthat Mindarus was in Cyzicus, and that Pharnabazus, with a body of\r\ninfantry, was with him. Accordingly they waited the whole of this day at\r\nProconnesus. On the following day Alcibiades summoned an assembly,\r\nand addressing the men in terms of encouragement, warned them that a\r\nthreefold service was expected of them; that they must be ready for a\r\nsea fight, a land fight, and a wall fight all at once, \"for look you,\"\r\nsaid he, \"we have no money, but the enemy has unlimited supplies from\r\nthe king.\"\r\n\r\nNow, on the previous day, as soon as they were come to moorings, he had\r\ncollected all the sea-going craft of the island, big and little alike,\r\nunder his own control, that no one might report the number of his\r\nsquadron to the enemy, and he had further caused a proclamation to be\r\nmade, that any one caught sailing across to the opposite coast would be\r\npunished with death. When the meeting was over, he got his ships ready\r\nfor action, and stood out to sea towards Cyzicus in torrents of rain.\r\nOff Cyzicus the sky cleared, and the sun shone out and revealed to him\r\nthe spectacle of Mindarus's vessels, sixty in number, exercising at some\r\ndistance from the harbour, and, in fact, intercepted by himself. The\r\nPeloponnesians, perceiving at a glance the greatly increased number of\r\nthe Athenian galleys, and noting their proximity to the port, made haste\r\nto reach the land, where they brought their vessels to anchor in a\r\nbody, and prepared to engage the enemy as he sailed to the attack. But\r\nAlcibiades, sailing round with twenty of his vessels, came to land and\r\ndisembarked. Seeing this, Mindarus also landed, and in the engagement\r\nwhich ensued he fell fighting, whilst those who were with him took to\r\nflight. As for the enemy's ships, the Athenians succeeded in capturing\r\nthe whole of them (with the exception of the Syracusan vessels,\r\nwhich were burnt by their crews), and made off with their prizes to\r\nProconnesus. From thence on the following day they sailed to attack\r\nCyzicus. The men of that place, seeing that the Peloponnesians and\r\nPharnabazus had evacuated the town, admitted the Athenians. Here\r\nAlcibiades remained twenty days, obtaining large sums of money from\r\nthe Cyzicenes, but otherwise inflicting no sort of mischief on the\r\ncommunity. He then sailed back to Proconnesus, and from there to\r\nPerinthus and Selybria. The inhabitants of the former place welcomed his\r\ntroops into their city, but the Selybrians preferred to give money,\r\nand so escape the admission of the troops. Continuing the voyage the\r\nsquadron reached Chrysopolis in Chalcedonia, (5) where they built a\r\nfort, and established a custom-house to collect the tithe dues which\r\nthey levied on all merchantmen passing through the Straits from the\r\nBlack Sea. Besides this, a detachment of thirty ships was left there\r\nunder the two generals, Theramenes and Eubulus, with instructions not\r\nonly to keep a look-out on the port itself and on all traders passing\r\nthrough the channel, but generally to injure the enemy in any way which\r\nmight present itself. This done, the rest of the generals hastened back\r\nto the Hellespont.\r\n\r\n (5) This is the common spelling, but the coins of Calchedon have the\r\n    letters {KALKH}, and so the name is written in the best MSS. of\r\n    Herodotus, Xenophon, and other writers, by whom the place is\r\n    named. See \"Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog.\" \"Chalcedon.\"\r\n\r\nNow a despatch from Hippocrates, Mindarus's vice-admiral, (6) had been\r\nintercepted on its way to Lacedaemon, and taken to Athens. It ran\r\nas follows (in broad Doric): (7) \"Ships gone; Mindarus dead; the men\r\nstarving; at our wits' end what to do.\"\r\n\r\n (6) \"Epistoleus,\" i.e. secretary or despatch writer, is the Spartan\r\n    title of the officer second in command to the admiral.\r\n\r\n (7) Reading {'Errei ta kala} (Bergk's conjecture for {kala}) =\r\n    \"timbers,\" i.e. \"ships\" (a Doric word). Cf. Aristoph., \"Lys.\"\r\n    1253, {potta kala}. The despatch continues: {Mindaros apessoua}\r\n    (al. {apessua}), which is much more racy than the simple word\r\n    \"dead.\" \"M. is gone off.\" I cannot find the right English or\r\n    \"broad Scotch\" equivalent. See Thirlwall, \"Hist. Gr.\" IV. xxix. 88\r\n    note.\r\n\r\nPharnabazus, however, was ready to meet with encouragement the\r\ndespondency which afflicted the whole Peloponnesian army and their\r\nallies. \"As long as their own bodies were safe and sound, why need\r\nthey take to heart the loss of a few wooden hulls? Was there not timber\r\nenough and to spare in the king's territory?\" And so he presented each\r\nman with a cloak and maintenance for a couple of months, after which he\r\narmed the sailors and formed them into a coastguard for the security of\r\nhis own seaboard.\r\n\r\nHe next called a meeting of the generals and trierarchs of the different\r\nStates, and instructed them to build just as many new ships in the\r\ndockyards of Antandrus as they had respectively lost. He himself was to\r\nfurnish the funds, and he gave them to understand that they might\r\nbring down timber from Mount Ida. While the ships were building, the\r\nSyracusans helped the men of Antandrus to finish a section of their\r\nwalls, and were particularly pleasant on garrison duty; and that is why\r\nthe Syracusans to this day enjoy the privilege of citizenship, with the\r\ntitle of \"benefactors,\" at Antandrus. Having so arranged these matters,\r\nPharnabazus proceeded at once to the rescue of Chalcedon.\r\n\r\nIt was at this date that the Syracusan generals received news from home\r\nof their banishment by the democratic party. Accordingly they called a\r\nmeeting of their separate divisions, and putting forward Hermocrates\r\n(8) as their spokesman, proceeded to deplore their misfortune, insisting\r\nupon the injustice and the illegality of their banishment. \"And now let\r\nus admonish you,\" they added, \"to be eager and willing in the future,\r\neven as in the past: whatever the word of command may be, show\r\nyourselves good men and true: let not the memory of those glorious sea\r\nfights fade. Think of those victories you have won, those ships you\r\nhave captured by your own unaided efforts; forget not that long list of\r\nachievements shared by yourselves with others, in all which you\r\nproved yourselves invincible under our generalship. It was to a happy\r\ncombination of our merit and your enthusiasm, displayed alike on land\r\nand sea, that you owe the strength and perfection of your discipline.\"\r\n\r\n (8) Hermocrates, the son of Hermon. We first hear of him in Thuc. iv.\r\n    58 foll. as the chief agent in bringing the Sicilian States\r\n    together in conference at Gela B.C. 424, with a view to healing\r\n    their differences and combining to frustrate the dangerous designs\r\n    of Athens. In 415 B.C., when the attack came, he was again the\r\n    master spirit in rendering it abortive (Thuc. vi. 72 foll.) In 412\r\n    B.C. it was he who urged the Sicilians to assist in completing the\r\n    overthrow of Athens, by sending a squadron to co-operate with the\r\n    Peloponnesian navy--for the relief of Miletus, etc. (Thuc. viii.\r\n    26, 27 foll.) At a later date, in 411 B.C., when the Peloponnesian\r\n    sailors were ready to mutiny, and \"laid all their grievances to\r\n    the charge of Astyochus (the Spartan admiral), who humoured\r\n    Tissaphernes for his own gain\" (Thuc. viii. 83), Hermocrates took\r\n    the men's part, and so incurred the hatred of Tissaphernes.\r\n\r\nWith these words they called upon the men to choose other commanders,\r\nwho should undertake the duties of their office, until the arrival of\r\ntheir successors. Thereupon the whole assembly, and more particularly\r\nthe captains and masters of vessels and marines, insisted with loud\r\ncries on their continuance in command. The generals replied, \"It was\r\nnot for them to indulge in faction against the State, but rather it was\r\ntheir duty, in case any charges were forthcoming against themselves,\r\nat once to render an account.\" When, however, no one had any kind of\r\naccusation to prefer, they yielded to the general demand, and were\r\ncontent to await the arrival of their successors. The names of these\r\nwere--Demarchus, the son of Epidocus; Myscon, the son of Mencrates; and\r\nPotamis, the son of Gnosis.\r\n\r\nThe captains, for their part, swore to restore the exiled generals as\r\nsoon as they themselves should return to Syracuse. At present with\r\na general vote of thanks they despatched them to their several\r\ndestinations. It particular those who had enjoyed the society of\r\nHermocrates recalled his virtues with regret, his thoroughness and\r\nenthusiasm, his frankness and affability, the care with which every\r\nmorning and evening he was wont to gather in his quarters a group of\r\nnaval captains and mariners whose ability he recognised. These were his\r\nconfidants, to whom he communicated what he intended to say or do: they\r\nwere his pupils, to whom he gave lessons in oratory, now calling upon\r\nthem to speak extempore, and now again after deliberation. By these\r\nmeans Hermocrates had gained a wide reputation at the council board,\r\nwhere his mastery of language was no less felt than the wisdom of his\r\nadvice. Appearing at Lacedaemon as the accuser of Tissaphernes, (9) he\r\nhad carried his case, not only by the testimony of Astyochus, but by\r\nthe obvious sincerity of his statements, and on the strength of this\r\nreputation he now betook himself to Pharnabazus. The latter did not wait\r\nto be asked, but at once gave him money, which enabled him to collect\r\nfriends and triremes, with a view to his ultimate recall to Syracuse.\r\nMeanwhile the successors of the Syracusans had arrived at Miletus, where\r\nthey took charge of the ships and the army.\r\n\r\n (9) The matter referred to is fully explained Thuc. viii. 85.\r\n\r\nIt was at this same season that a revolution occurred in Thasos,\r\ninvolving the expulsion of the philo-Laconian party, with the Laconian\r\ngovernor Eteonicus. The Laconian Pasippidas was charged with having\r\nbrought the business about in conjunction with Tissaphernes, and was\r\nbanished from Sparta in consequence. The naval force which he had been\r\ncollecting from the allies was handed over to Cratesippidas, who was\r\nsent out to take his place in Chios.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period, while Thrasylus was still in Athens, Agis\r\n(10) made a foraging expedition up to the very walls of the city. But\r\nThrasylus led out the Athenians with the rest of the inhabitants of the\r\ncity, and drew them up by the side of the Lyceum Gymnasium, ready to\r\nengage the enemy if they approached; seeing which, Agis beat a hasty\r\nretreat, not however without the loss of some of his supports, a few of\r\nwhom were cut down by the Athenian light troops. This success disposed\r\nthe citizens to take a still more favourable view of the objects for\r\nwhich Thrasylus had come; and they passed a decree empowering him to\r\ncall out a thousand hoplites, one hundred cavalry, and fifty triremes.\r\n\r\n (10) The reader will recollect that we are giving in \"the Deceleian\"\r\n    period of the war, 413-404 B.C. The Spartan king was in command of\r\n    the fortress of Deceleia, only fourteen miles distant from Athens,\r\n    and erected on a spot within sight of the city. See Thuc. vii. 19,\r\n    27, 28.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Agis, as he looked out from Deceleia, and saw vessel after\r\nvessel laden with corn running down to Piraeus, declared that it was\r\nuseless for his troops to go on week after week excluding the Athenians\r\nfrom their own land, while no one stopped the source of their corn\r\nsupply by sea: the best plan would be to send Clearchus, (11) the son\r\nof Rhamphius, who was proxenos (12) of the Byzantines, to Chalcedon and\r\nByzantium. The suggestion was approved, and with fifteen vessels duly\r\nmanned from Megara, or furnished by other allies, Clearchus set out.\r\nThese were troop-ships rather than swift-sailing men-of-war. Three of\r\nthem, on reaching the Hellespont, were destroyed by the Athenian ships\r\nemployed to keep a sharp look-out on all merchant craft in those waters.\r\nThe other twelve escaped to Sestos, and thence finally reached Byzantium\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\n (11) Of Clearchus we shall hear more in the sequel, and in the\r\n    \"Anabasis.\"\r\n\r\n (12) The Proxenus answered pretty nearly to our \"Consul,\" \"Agent,\"\r\n    \"Resident\"; but he differed in this respect, that he was always a\r\n    member of the foreign State. An Athenian represented Sparta at\r\n    Athens; a Laconian represented Athens at Sparta, and so forth. See\r\n    Liddell and Scott.\r\n\r\nSo closed the year--a year notable also for the expedition against\r\nSicily of the Carthaginians under Hannibal with one hundred thousand\r\nmen, and the capture, within three months, of the two Hellenic cities of\r\nSelinus and Himera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nB.C. 409. Next year (1)... the Athenians fortified Thoricus; and\r\nThrasylus, taking the vessels lately voted him and five thousand of\r\nhis seamen armed to serve as peltasts, (2) set sail for Samos at the\r\nbeginning of summer. At Samos he stayed three days, and then continued\r\nhis voyage to Pygela, where he proceeded to ravage the territory and\r\nattack the fortress. Presently a detachment from Miletus came to the\r\nrescue of the men of Pygela, and attacking the scattered bands of the\r\nAthenian light troops, put them to flight. But to the aid of the light\r\ntroops came the naval brigade of peltasts, with two companies of heavy\r\ninfantry, and all but annihilated the whole detachment from Miletus.\r\nThey captured about two hundred shields, and set up a trophy. Next day\r\nthey sailed to Notium, and from Notium, after due preparation, marched\r\nupon Colophon. The Colophonians capitulated without a blow. The\r\nfollowing night they made an incursion into Lydia, where the corn crops\r\nwere ripe, and burnt several villages, and captured money, slaves, and\r\nother booty in large quantity. But Stages, the Persian, who was employed\r\nin this neighbourhood, fell in with a reinforcement of cavalry sent to\r\nprotect the scattered pillaging parties from the Athenian camp, whilst\r\noccupied with their individual plunder, and took one trooper prisoner,\r\nkilling seven others. After this Thrasylus led his troops back to the\r\nsea, intending to sail to Ephesus. Meanwhile Tissaphernes, who had wind\r\nof this intention, began collecting a large army and despatching cavalry\r\nwith a summons to the inhabitants one and all to rally to the defence of\r\nthe goddess Artemis at Ephesus.\r\n\r\n (1) The MSS. here give a suspected passage, which may be rendered\r\n    thus: \"The first of Olympiad 93, celebrated as the year in which\r\n    the newly-added two-horse race was won by Evagorias the Eleian,\r\n    and the stadion (200 yards foot-race) by the Cyrenaean Eubotas,\r\n    when Evarchippus was ephor at Sparta and Euctemon archon at\r\n    Athens.\" But Ol. 93, to which these officers,and the addition of\r\n    the new race at Olympia belong, is the year 408. We must therefore\r\n    suppose either that this passage has been accidentally inserted in\r\n    the wrong place by some editor or copyist, or that the author was\r\n    confused in his dates. The \"stadium\" is the famous foot-race at\r\n    Olympia, 606 3/4 English feet in length, run on a course also\r\n    called the \"Stadion,\" which was exactly a stade long.\r\n\r\n (2) Peltasts, i.e. light infantry armed with the \"pelta\" or light\r\n    shield, instead of the heavy {aspis} of the hoplite or heavy\r\n    infantry soldiers.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day after the incursion above mentioned Thrasylus\r\nsailed to Ephesus. He disembarked his troops in two divisions, his heavy\r\ninfantry in the neighbourhood of Mount Coressus; his cavalry, peltasts,\r\nand marines, with the remainder of his force, near the marsh on the\r\nother side of the city. At daybreak he pushed forward both divisions.\r\nThe citizens of Ephesus, on their side, were not slow to protect\r\nthemselves. They had to aid them the troops brought up by Tissaphernes,\r\nas well as two detachments of Syracusans, consisting of the crews of\r\ntheir former twenty vessels and those of five new vessels which had\r\nopportunely arrived quite recently under Eucles, the son of Hippon,\r\nand Heracleides, the son of Aristogenes, together with two Selinuntian\r\nvessels. All these several forces first attacked the heavy infantry\r\nnear Coressus; these they routed, killing about one hundred of them, and\r\ndriving the remainder down into the sea. They then turned to deal with\r\nthe second division on the marsh. Here, too, the Athenians were put to\r\nflight, and as many as three hundred of them perished. On this spot the\r\nEphesians erected a trophy, and another at Coressus. The valour of the\r\nSyracusans and Selinuntians had been so conspicuous that the citizens\r\npresented many of them, both publicly and privately, with prizes for\r\ndistinction in the field, besides offering the right of residence in\r\ntheir city with certain immunities to all who at any time might wish to\r\nlive there. To the Selinuntians, indeed, as their own city had lately\r\nbeen destroyed, they offered full citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, after picking up their dead under a truce, set sail\r\nfor Notium, and having there buried the slain, continued their voyage\r\ntowards Lesbos and the Hellespont. Whilst lying at anchor in the harbour\r\nof Methymna, in that island, they caught sight of the Syracusan vessels,\r\nfive-and-twenty in number, coasting along from Ephesus. They put out to\r\nsea to attack them, and captured four ships with their crews, and chased\r\nthe remainder back to Ephesus. The prisoners were sent by Thrasylus to\r\nAthens, with one exception. This was an Athenian, Alcibiades, who was a\r\ncousin and fellow-exile of Alcibiades. Him Thrasylus released. (3) From\r\nMethymna Thrasylus set sail to Sestos to join the main body of the army,\r\nafter which the united forces crossed to Lampsacus. And now winter was\r\napproaching. It was the winter in which the Syracusan prisoners who had\r\nbeen immured in the stone quarries of Piraeus dug through the rock and\r\nescaped one night, some to Decelia and others to Megara. At Lampsacus\r\nAlcibiades was anxious to marshal the whole military force there\r\ncollected in one body, but the old troops refused to be incorporated\r\nwith those of Thrasylus. \"They, who had never yet been beaten, with\r\nthese newcomers who had just suffered a defeat.\" So they devoted the\r\nwinter to fortifying Lampsacus. They also made an expedition against\r\nAbydos, where Pharnabazus, coming to the rescue of the place,\r\nencountered them with numerous cavalry, but was defeated and forced\r\nto flee, Alcibiades pursuing hard with his cavalry and one hundred and\r\ntwenty infantry under the command of Menander, till darkness intervened.\r\nAfter this battle the soldiers came together of their own accord, and\r\nfreely fraternised with the troops of Thrasylus. This expedition was\r\nfollowed by other incursions during the winter into the interior, where\r\nthey found plenty to do ravaging the king's territory.\r\n\r\n (3) Reading {apelusen}.

It was also about the same period that the\r\nAchaeans betrayed the colonists of Heracleia Trachinia, when they were\r\nall drawn up in battle to meet the hostile Oetaeans, whereby as many\r\nas seven hundred of them were lost, together with the governor (4) from\r\nLacedaemon, Labotas. Thus the year came to its close--a year marked\r\nfurther by a revolt of the Medes from Darius, the king of Persia,\r\nfollowed by renewed submission to his authority.\r\n\r\n (4) Technically {armostes} (harmost), i.e. administrator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nB.C. 408. The year following is the year in which the temple of Athena,\r\nin Phocaea, was struck by lightning and set on fire. (1) With the\r\ncessation of winter, in early spring, the Athenians set sail with the\r\nwhole of their force to Proconnesus, and thence advanced upon Chalcedon\r\nand Byzantium, encamping near the former town. The men of Chalcedon,\r\naware of their approach, had taken the precaution to deposit all their\r\npillageable property with their neighbours, the Bithynian Thracians;\r\nwhereupon Alcibiades put himself at the head of a small body of heavy\r\ninfantry with the cavalry, and giving orders to the fleet to follow\r\nalong the coast, marched against the Bithynians and demanded back the\r\nproperty of the Chalcedonians, threatening them with war in case of\r\nrefusal. The Bithynians delivered up the property. Returning to camp,\r\nnot only thus enriched, but with the further satisfaction of having\r\nsecured pledges of good behaviour from the Bithynians, Alcibiades set to\r\nwork with the whole of his troops to draw lines of circumvallation round\r\nChalcedon from sea to sea, so as to include as much of the river as\r\npossible within his wall, which was made of timber. Thereupon the\r\nLacedaemonian governor, Hippocrates, let his troops out of the city and\r\noffered battle, and the Athenians, on their side, drew up their forces\r\nopposite to receive him; while Pharnabazus, from without the lines of\r\ncircumvallation, was still advancing with his army and large bodies of\r\nhorse. Hippocrates and Thrasylus engaged each other with their heavy\r\ninfantry for a long while, until Alcibiades, with a detachment of\r\ninfantry and the cavalry, intervened. Presently Hippocrates fell,\r\nand the troops under him fled into the city; at the same instant\r\nPharnabazus, unable to effect a junction with the Lacedaemonian leader,\r\nowing to the circumscribed nature of the ground and the close proximity\r\nof the river to the enemy's lines, retired to the Heracleium, (2)\r\nbelonging to the Chalcedonians, where his camp lay. After this success\r\nAlcibiades set off to the Hellespont and the Chersonese to raise money,\r\nand the remaining generals came to terms with Pharnabazus in respect\r\nof Chalcedon; according to these, the Persian satrap agreed to pay the\r\nAthenians twenty talents (3) in behalf of the town, and to grant their\r\nambassadors a safe conduct up country to the king. It was further\r\nstipulated by mutual consent and under oaths provided, that the\r\nChalcedonians should continue the payment of their customary tribute\r\nto Athens, being also bound to discharge all outstanding debts. The\r\nAthenians, on their side, were bound to desist from all hostilities\r\nuntil the return of their ambassadors from the king. These oaths\r\nwere not witnessed by Alcibiades, who was now in the neighbourhood of\r\nSelybria. Having taken that place, he presently appeared before the\r\nwalls of Byzantium at the head of the men of Chersonese, who came out\r\nwith their whole force; he was aided further by troops from Thrace and\r\nmore than three hundred horse. Accordingly Pharnabazus, insisting that\r\nhe too must take the oath, decided to remain in Chalcedon, and to await\r\nhis arrival from Byzantium. Alcibiades came, but was not prepared to\r\nbind himself by any oaths, unless Pharnabazus would, on his side, take\r\noaths to himself. After this, oaths were exchanged between them by\r\nproxy. Alcibiades took them at Chrysopolis in the presence of two\r\nrepresentatives sent by Pharnabazus--namely, Mitrobates and Arnapes.\r\nPharnabazus took them at Chalcedon in the presence of Euryptolemus and\r\nDiotimus, who represented Alcibiades. Both parties bound themselves not\r\nonly by the general oath, but also interchanged personal pledges of good\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n (1) The MSS. here give the words, \"in the ephorate of Pantacles and\r\n    the archonship of Antigenes, two-and-twenty years from the\r\n    beginning of the war,\" but the twenty-second year of the war =\r\n    B.C. 410; Antigenes archon, B.C. 407 = Ol. 93, 2; the passage must\r\n    be regarded as a note mis-inserted by some editor or copyist (vide\r\n    supra, I. 11.)\r\n\r\n (2) I.e. sacred place or temple of Heracles.\r\n\r\n (3) Twenty talents = 4800 pounds; or, more exactly, 4875 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis done, Pharnabazus left Chalcedon at once, with injunctions that\r\nthose who were going up to the king as ambassadors should meet him\r\nat Cyzicus. The representatives of Athens were Dorotheus, Philodices,\r\nTheogenes, Euryptolemus, and Mantitheus; with them were two Argives,\r\nCleostratus and Pyrrholochus. An embassy of the Lacedaemonians was also\r\nabout to make the journey. This consisted of Pasippidas and his fellows,\r\nwith whom were Hermocrates, now an exile from Syracuse, and his brother\r\nProxenus. So Pharnabazus put himself at their head. Meanwhile the\r\nAthenians prosecuted the siege of Byzantium; lines of circumvallation\r\nwere drawn; and they diversified the blockade by sharpshooting at\r\nlong range and occasional assaults upon the walls. Inside the city lay\r\nClearchus, the Lacedaemonian governor, and a body of Perioci with a\r\nsmall detachment of Neodamodes. (4) There was also a body of Megarians\r\nunder their general Helixus, a Megarian, and another body of Boeotians,\r\nwith their general Coeratadas. The Athenians, finding presently that\r\nthey could effect nothing by force, worked upon some of the inhabitants\r\nto betray the place. Clearchus, meanwhile, never dreaming that any one\r\nwould be capable of such an act, had crossed over to the opposite\r\ncoast to visit Pharnabazus; he had left everything in perfect order,\r\nentrusting the government of the city to Coeratadas and Helixus. His\r\nmission was to obtain pay for the soldiers from the Persian satrap,\r\nand to collect vessels from various quarters. Some were already in the\r\nHellespont, where they had been left as guardships by Pasippidas, or\r\nelse at Antandrus. Others formed the fleet which Agesandridas, who had\r\nformerly served as a marine (5) under Mindarus, now commanded on the\r\nThracian coast. Others Clearchus purposed to have built, and with the\r\nwhole united squadron to so injure the allies of the Athenians as to\r\ndraw off the besieging army from Byzantium. But no sooner was he fairly\r\ngone than those who were minded to betray the city set to work. Their\r\nnames were Cydon, Ariston, Anaxicrates, Lycurgus, and Anaxilaus. The\r\nlast-named was afterwards impeached for treachery in Lacedaemon on the\r\ncapital charge, and acquitted on the plea that, to begin with, he was\r\nnot a Lacedaemonian, but a Byzantine, and, so far from having betrayed\r\nthe city, he had saved it, when he saw women and children perishing of\r\nstarvation; for Clearchus had given away all the corn in the city to the\r\nLacedaemonian soldiers. It was for these reasons, as Anaxilaus himself\r\nadmitted, he had introduced the enemy, and not for the sake of money,\r\nnor out of hatred to Lacedaemon.\r\n\r\n (4) According to the constitution of Lacedaemon the whole government\r\n    was in Dorian hands. The subject population was divided into (1)\r\n    Helots, who were State serfs. The children of Helots were at times\r\n    brought up by Spartans and called \"Mothakes\"; Helots who had\r\n    received their liberty were called \"Neodamodes\" ({neodamodeis}).\r\n    After the conquest of Messenia this class was very numerous. (2)\r\n    Perioeci. These were the ancient Achaean inhabitants, living in\r\n    towns and villages, and managing their own affairs, paying\r\n    tribute, and serving in the army as heavy-armed soldiers. In 458\r\n    B.C. they were said to number thirty thousand. The Spartans\r\n    themselves were divided, like all Dorians, into three tribes,\r\n    Hylleis, Dymanes, and Pamphyli, each of which tribes was divided\r\n    into ten \"obes,\" which were again divided into {oikoi} or families\r\n    possessed of landed properties. In 458 B.C. there were said to be\r\n    nine thousand such families; but in course of time, through\r\n    alienation of lands, deaths in war, and other causes, their\r\n    numbers were much diminished; and in many cases there was a loss\r\n    of status, so that in the time of Agis III., B.C. 244, we hear of\r\n    two orders of Spartans, the {omoioi} and the {upomeiones}\r\n    (inferiors); seven hundred Spartans (families) proper and one\r\n    hundred landed proprietors. See Mullers \"Dorians,\" vol. ii. bk.\r\n    iii. ch. x. S. 3 (Eng. trans.); Arist. \"Pol.\" ii. 9, 15; Plut.\r\n    (\"Agis\").\r\n\r\n (5) The greek word is {epibates}, which some think was the title of an\r\n    inferior naval officer in the Spartan service, but there is no\r\n    proof of this. Cf. Thuc. viii. 61, and Prof. Jowett's note; also\r\n    Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" viii. 27 (2d ed.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as everything was ready, these people opened the gates leading\r\nto the Thracian Square, as it is called, and admitted the Athenian\r\ntroops with Alcibiades at their head. Helixus and Coeratadas, in\r\ncomplete ignorance of the plot, hastened to the Agora with the whole\r\nof the garrison, ready to confront the danger; but finding the enemy in\r\noccupation, they had nothing for it but to give themselves up. They were\r\nsent off as prisoners to Athens, where Coeratadas, in the midst of the\r\ncrowd and confusion of debarkation at Piraeus, gave his guards the slip,\r\nand made his way in safety to Decelia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nB.C. 407. Pharnabazus and the ambassadors were passing the winter at\r\nGordium in Phrygia, when they heard of the occurrences at Byzantium.\r\nContinuing their journey to the king's court in the commencement of\r\nspring, they were met by a former embassy, which was now on its return\r\njourney. These were the Lacedaemonian ambassadors, Boeotius and his\r\nparty, with the other envoys; who told them that the Lacedaemonians had\r\nobtained from the king all they wanted. One of the company was Cyrus,\r\nthe new governor of all the seaboard districts, who was prepared to\r\nco-operate with the Lacedaemonians in war. He was the bearer, moreover,\r\nof a letter with the royal seal attached. It was addressed to all the\r\npopulations of Lower Asia, and contained the following words: \"I send\r\ndown Cyrus as 'Karanos'\" (1)--that is to say, supreme lord--\"over all\r\nthose who muster at Castolus.\" The ambassadors of the Athenians, even\r\nwhile listening to this announcement, and indeed after they had seen\r\nCyrus, were still desirous, if possible, to continue their journey to\r\nthe king, or, failing that, to return home. Cyrus, however, urged upon\r\nPharnabazus either to deliver them up to himself, or to defer sending\r\nthem home at present; his object being to prevent the Athenians learning\r\nwhat was going on. Pharnabazus, wishing to escape all blame, for the\r\ntime being detained them, telling them, at one time, that he would\r\npresently escort them up country to the king, and at another time that\r\nhe would send them safe home. But when three years had elapsed, he\r\nprayed Cyrus to let them go, declaring that he had taken an oath to\r\nbring them back to the sea, in default of escorting them up to the king.\r\nThen at last they received safe conduct to Ariobarzanes, with orders for\r\ntheir further transportation. The latter conducted them a stage further,\r\nto Cius in Mysia; and from Cius they set sail to join their main\r\narmament.\r\n\r\n (1) {Karanos.} Is this a Greek word, a Doric form, {karanos}, akin to\r\n    {kara} (cf. {karenon}) = chief? or is it not more likely a Persian\r\n    or native word, Karanos? and might not the title be akin\r\n    conceivably to the word {korano}, which occurs on many Indo-\r\n    Bactrian coins (see A. von Sallet, \"Die Nachfolger Alexanders des\r\n    Grossen,\" p. 57, etc.)? or is {koiranos} the connecting link? The\r\n    words translated \"that is to say, supreme lord,\" {to de karanon\r\n    esti kurion}, look very like a commentator's gloss.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades, whose chief desire was to return home to Athens with the\r\ntroops, immediately set sail for Samos; and from that island, taking\r\ntwenty of the ships, he sailed to the Ceramic Gulf of Caria, where he\r\ncollected a hundred talents, and so returned to Samos.\r\n\r\nThrasybulus had gone Thrace-wards with thirty ships. In this quarter he\r\nreduced various places which had revolted to Lacedaemon, including\r\nthe island of Thasos, which was in a bad plight, the result of wars,\r\nrevolutions, and famine.\r\n\r\nThrasylus, with the rest of the army, sailed back straight to Athens.\r\nOn his arrival he found that the Athenians had already chosen as their\r\ngeneral Alcibiades, who was still in exile, and Thrasybulus, who was\r\nalso absent, and as a third, from among those at home, Conon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Alcibiades, with the moneys lately collected and his fleet of\r\ntwenty ships, left Samos and visited Paros. From Paros he stood out to\r\nsea across to Gytheum, (2) to keep an eye on the thirty ships of war\r\nwhich, as he was informed, the Lacedaemonians were equipping in that\r\narsenal. Gytheum would also be a favourable point of observation\r\nfrom which to gauge the disposition of his fellow-countrymen and the\r\nprospects of his recall. When at length their good disposition seemed\r\nto him established, not only by his election as general, but by the\r\nmessages of invitation which he received in private from his friends, he\r\nsailed home, and entered Piraeus on the very day of the festival of the\r\nPlunteria, (3) when the statue of Athena is veiled and screened from\r\npublic gaze. This was a coincidence, as some thought, of evil omen,\r\nand unpropitious alike to himself and the State, for no Athenian would\r\ntransact serious business on such a day.\r\n\r\n (2) Gytheum, the port and arsenal of Sparta, situated near the head of\r\n    the Laconian Gulf (now Marathonisi).\r\n\r\n (3) {ta Plunteria}, or feast of washings, held on the 25th of the\r\n    month Thargelion, when the image of the goddess Athena was\r\n    stripped in order that her clothes might be washed by the\r\n    Praxiergidae; neither assembly nor court was held on that day, and\r\n    the Temple was closed.\r\n\r\nAs he sailed into the harbour, two great crowds--one from the Piraeus,\r\nthe other from the city (4)--flocked to meet the vessels. Wonderment,\r\nmixed with a desire to see Alcibiades, was the prevailing sentiment of\r\nthe multitude. Of him they spoke: some asserting that he was the best\r\nof citizens, and that in his sole instance banishment had been\r\nill-deserved. He had been the victim of plots, hatched in the brains\r\nof people less able than himself, however much they might excel in\r\npestilent speech; men whose one principle of statecraft was to look to\r\ntheir private gains; whereas this man's policy had ever been to uphold\r\nthe common weal, as much by his private means as by all the power of the\r\nState. His own choice, eight years ago, when the charge of impiety in\r\nthe matter of the mysteries was still fresh, would have been to submit\r\nto trial at once. It was his personal foes, who had succeeded in\r\npostponing that undeniably just procedure; who waited till his back was\r\nturned, and then robbed him of his fatherland. Then it was that, being\r\nmade the very slave of circumstance, he was driven to court the men he\r\nhated most; and at a time when his own life was in daily peril, he must\r\nsee his dearest friends and fellow-citizens, nay, the very State itself,\r\nbent on a suicidal course, and yet, in the exclusion of exile, be unable\r\nto lend a helping hand. \"It is not men of this stamp,\" they averred,\r\n\"who desire changes in affairs and revolution: had he not already\r\nguaranteed to him by the Democracy a position higher than that of his\r\nequals in age, and scarcely if at all inferior to his seniors? How\r\ndifferent was the position of his enemies. It had been the fortune of\r\nthese, though they were known to be the same men they had always been,\r\nto use their lately acquired power for the destruction in the first\r\ninstance of the better classes; and then, being alone left surviving, to\r\nbe accepted by their fellow-citizens in the absence of better men.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"collected to meet the vessels from curiosity and a desire to\r\n    see Alcibiades.\"\r\n\r\nOthers, however, insisted that for all their past miseries and\r\nmisfortunes Alcibiades alone was responsible: \"If more trials were still\r\nin store for the State, here was the master mischief-maker ready at his\r\npost to precipitate them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the vessels came to their moorings, close to the land, Alcibiades,\r\nfrom fear of his enemies, was unwilling to disembark at once. Mounting\r\non the quarterdeck, he scanned the multitude, (5) anxious to make\r\ncertain of the presence of his friends. Presently his eyes lit upon\r\nEuryptolemus, the son of Peisianax, who was his cousin, and then on the\r\nrest of his relations and other friends. Upon this he landed, and so,\r\nin the midst of an escort ready to put down any attempt upon his person,\r\nmade his way to the city.\r\n\r\n (5) Or, \"he looked to see if his friends were there.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Senate and Public Assembly (6) he made speeches, defending\r\nhimself against the charge of impiety, and asserting that he had been\r\nthe victim of injustice, with other like topics, which in the present\r\ntemper of the assembly no one ventured to gainsay.\r\n\r\n (6) Technically the \"Boule\" ({Boule}) or Senate, and \"Ecclesia\" or\r\n    Popular Assembly.\r\n\r\nHe was then formally declared leader and chief of the State, with\r\nirresponsible powers, as being the sole individual capable of recovering\r\nthe ancient power and prestige of Athens. Armed with this authority, his\r\nfirst act was to institute anew the processional march to Eleusis;\r\nfor of late years, owing to the war, the Athenians had been forced to\r\nconduct the mysteries by sea. Now, at the head of the troops, he caused\r\nthem to be conducted once again by land. This done, his next step was\r\nto muster an armament of one thousand five hundred heavy infantry, one\r\nhundred and fifty cavalry, and one hundred ships; and lastly, within\r\nthree months of his return, he set sail for Andros, which had revolted\r\nfrom Athens.\r\n\r\nThe generals chosen to co-operate with him on land were Aristocrates and\r\nAdeimantus, the son of Leucophilides. He disembarked his troops on the\r\nisland of Andros at Gaurium, and routed the Andrian citizens who sallied\r\nout from the town to resist the invader; forcing them to return and keep\r\nclose within their walls, though the number who fell was not large.\r\nThis defeat was shared by some Lacedaemonians who were in the place.\r\nAlcibiades erected a trophy, and after a few days set sail himself for\r\nSamos, which became his base of operations in the future conduct of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAt a date not much earlier than that of the incidents just described,\r\nthe Lacedaemonians had sent out Lysander as their admiral, in the place\r\nof Cratesippidas, whose period of office had expired. The new admiral\r\nfirst visited Rhodes, where he got some ships, and sailed to Cos and\r\nMiletus, and from the latter place to Ephesus. At Ephesus he waited with\r\nseventy sail, expecting the advent of Cyrus in Sardis, when he at once\r\nwent up to pay the prince a visit with the ambassadors from Lacedaemon.\r\nAnd now an opportunity was given to denounce the proceedings of\r\nTissaphernes, and at the same time to beg Cyrus himself to show as much\r\nzeal as possible in the prosecution of the war. Cyrus replied that not\r\nonly had he received express injunction from his father to the same\r\neffect, but that his own views coincided with their wishes, which he was\r\ndetermined to carry out to the letter. He had, he informed them, brought\r\nwith him five hundred talents; (1) and if that sum failed, he had still\r\nthe private revenue, which his father allowed him, to fall back upon,\r\nand when this resource was in its turn exhausted, he would coin the gold\r\nand silver throne on which he sat, into money for their benefit. (2)\r\n\r\n (1) About 120,000 pounds. One Euboic or Attic talent = sixty minae =\r\n    six thousand drachmae = 243 pounds 15 shillings of our money.\r\n\r\n (2) Cf. the language of Tissaphernes, Thuc. viii. 81.\r\n\r\nHis audience thanked him for what he said, and further begged him to\r\nfix the rate of payment for the seamen at one Attic drachma per man, (3)\r\nexplaining that should this rate of payment be adopted, the sailors of\r\nthe Athenians would desert, and in the end there would be a saving\r\nof expenditure. Cyrus complimented them on the soundness of their\r\narguments, but said that it was not in his power to exceed the\r\ninjunctions of the king. The terms of agreement were precise, thirty\r\nminae (4) a month per vessel to be given, whatever number of vessels the\r\nLacedaemonians might choose to maintain.\r\n\r\n (3) About 9 3/4 pence; a drachma (= six obols) would be very high pay\r\n    for a sailor--indeed, just double the usual amount. See Thuc. vi.\r\n    8 and viii. 29, and Prof. Jowett ad loc. Tissaphernes had, in the\r\n    winter of 412 B.C., distributed one month's pay among the\r\n    Peloponnesian ships at this high rate of a drachma a day, \"as his\r\n    envoy had promised at Lacedaemon;\" but this he proposed to reduce\r\n    to half a drachma, \"until he had asked the king's leave, promising\r\n    that if he obtained it, he would pay the entire drachma. On the\r\n    remonstrance, however, of Hermocrates, the Syracusan general, he\r\n    promised to each man a payment of somewhat more than three obols.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Nearly 122 pounds; and thirty minae a month to each ship (the crew\r\n    of each ship being taken at two hundred) = three obols a day to\r\n    each man. The terms of agreement to which Cyrus refers may have\r\n    been specified in the convention mentioned above in chap. iv,\r\n    which Boeotius and the rest were so proud to have obtained. But\r\n    see Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. viii. p. 192 note (2d ed.)\r\n\r\nTo this rejoinder Lysander at the moment said nothing. But after dinner,\r\nwhen Cyrus drank to his health, asking him \"What he could do to gratify\r\nhim most?\" Lysander replied, \"Add an obol (5) to the sailors' pay.\"\r\nAfter this the pay was raised to four instead of three obols, as it\r\nhitherto had been. Nor did the liberality of Cyrus end here; he not only\r\npaid up all arrears, but further gave a month's pay in advance, so that,\r\nif the enthusiasm of the army had been great before, it was greater than\r\never now. The Athenians when they heard the news were proportionately\r\ndepressed, and by help of Tissaphernes despatched ambassadors to Cyrus.\r\nThat prince, however, refused to receive them, nor were the prayers of\r\nTissaphernes of any avail, however much he insisted that Cyrus should\r\nadopt the policy which he himself, on the advice of Alcibiades, had\r\npersistently acted on. This was simply not to suffer any single Hellenic\r\nstate to grow strong at the expense of the rest, but to keep them all\r\nweak alike, distracted by internecine strife.\r\n\r\n (5) An obol = one-sixth of a drachma; the Attic obol = rather more\r\n    than 1 1/2 pence.\r\n\r\nLysander, now that the organisation of his navy was arranged to his\r\nsatisfaction, beached his squadron of ninety vessels at Ephesus, and\r\nsat with hands folded, whilst the vessels dried and underwent repairs.\r\nAlcibiades, being informed that Thrasybulus had come south of the\r\nHellespont and was fortifying Phocaea, sailed across to join him,\r\nleaving his own pilot Antiochus in command of the fleet, with orders\r\nnot to attack Lysander's fleet. Antiochus, however, was tempted to leave\r\nNotium and sail into the harbour of Ephesus with a couple of ships, his\r\nown and another, past the prows of Lysander's squadron. The Spartan at\r\nfirst contented himself with launching a few of his ships, and started\r\nin pursuit of the intruder; but when the Athenians came out with other\r\nvessels to assist Antiochus, he formed his whole squadron into line of\r\nbattle, and bore down upon them, whereupon the Athenians followed suit,\r\nand getting their remaining triremes under weigh at Notium, stood out to\r\nsea as fast as each vessel could clear the point. (6) Thus it befell in\r\nthe engagement which ensued, that while the enemy was in due order, the\r\nAthenians came up in scattered detachments and without concert, and in\r\nthe end were put to flight with the loss of fifteen ships of war. Of the\r\ncrews, indeed, the majority escaped, though a certain number fell into\r\nthe hands of the enemy. Then Lysander collected his vessels, and having\r\nerected a trophy on Cape Notium, sailed across to Ephesus, whilst the\r\nAthenians retired to Samos.\r\n\r\n (6) {os ekastos enoixen}, for this nautical term see above.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Samos a little later, Alcibiades put out to sea with\r\nthe whole squadron in the direction of the harbour of Ephesus. At the\r\nmouth of the harbour he marshalled his fleet in battle order, and tried\r\nto tempt the enemy to an engagement; but as Lysander, conscious of his\r\ninferiority in numbers, refused to accept the challenge, he sailed\r\nback again to Samos. Shortly after this the Lacedaemonians captured\r\nDelphinium and Eion. (7)\r\n\r\n (7) This should probably be Teos, in Ionia, in spite of the MSS.\r\n    {'Eiona}. The place referred to cannot at any rate be the well-\r\n    known Eion at the mouth of the Strymon in Thrace.\r\n\r\nBut now the news of the late disaster at Notium had reached the\r\nAthenians at home, and in their indignation they turned upon Alcibiades,\r\nto whose negligence and lack of self-command they attributed\r\nthe destruction of the ships. Accordingly they chose ten new\r\ngenerals--namely Conon, Diomedon, Leon, Pericles, Erasinides,\r\nAristocrates, Archestratus, Protomachus, Thrasylus, and Aristogenes.\r\nAlcibiades, who was moreover in bad odour in the camp, sailed away with\r\na single trireme to his private fortress in the Chersonese.\r\n\r\nAfter this Conon, in obedience to a decree of the Athenian people,\r\nset sail from Andros with the twenty vessels under his command in that\r\nisland to Samos, and took command of the whole squadron. To fill the\r\nplace thus vacated by Conon, Phanosthenes was sent to Andros with four\r\nships. That captain was fortunate enough to intercept and capture\r\ntwo Thurian ships of war, crews and all, and these captives were all\r\nimprisoned by the Athenians, with the exception of their leader Dorieus.\r\nHe was the Rhodian, who some while back had been banished from Athens\r\nand from his native city by the Athenians, when sentence of death was\r\npassed upon him and his family. This man, who had once enjoyed the\r\nright of citizenship among them, they now took pity on and released him\r\nwithout ransom.\r\n\r\nWhen Conon had reached Samos he found the armament in a state of great\r\ndespondency. Accordingly his first measure was to man seventy ships with\r\ntheir full complement, instead of the former hundred and odd vessels.\r\nWith this squadron he put to sea accompanied by the other generals,\r\nand confined himself to making descents first at one point and then at\r\nanother of the enemy's territory, and to collecting plunder.\r\n\r\nAnd so the year drew to its close: a year signalled further by an\r\ninvasion of Sicily by the Carthaginians, with one hundred and twenty\r\nships of war and a land force of one hundred and twenty thousand men,\r\nwhich resulted in the capture of Agrigentum. The town was finally\r\nreduced to famine after a siege of seven months, the invaders having\r\npreviously been worsted in battle and forced to sit down before its\r\nwalls for so long a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nB.C. 406. In the following year--the year of the evening eclipse of the\r\nmoon, and the burning of the old temple of Athena (1) at Athens (2)--the\r\nLacedaemonians sent out Callicratidas to replace Lysander, whose period\r\nof office had now expired. (3) Lysander, when surrendering the squadron\r\nto his successor, spoke of himself as the winner of a sea fight, which\r\nhad left him in undisputed mastery of the sea, and with this boast\r\nhe handed over the ships to Callicratidas, who retorted, \"If you will\r\nconvey the fleet from Ephesus, keeping Samos (4) on your right\" (that\r\nis, past where the Athenian navy lay), \"and hand it over to me at\r\nMiletus, I will admit that you are master of the sea.\" But Lysander\r\nhad no mind to interfere in the province of another officer. Thus\r\nCallicratidas assumed responsibility. He first manned, in addition\r\nto the squadron which he received from Lysander, fifty new vessels\r\nfurnished by the allies from Chios and Rhodes and elsewhere. When all\r\nthese contingents were assembled, they formed a total of one hundred and\r\nforty sail, and with these he began making preparations for engagement\r\nwith the enemy. But it was impossible for him not to note the strong\r\ncurrent of opposition which he encountered from the friends of Lysander.\r\nNot only was there lack of zeal in their service, but they openly\r\ndisseminated an opinion in the States, that it was the greatest possible\r\nblunder on the part of the Lacedaemonians so to change their admirals.\r\nOf course, they must from time to time get officers altogether unfit for\r\nthe post--men whose nautical knowledge dated from yesterday, and who,\r\nmoreover, had no notion of dealing with human beings. It would be very\r\nodd if this practice of sending out people ignorant of the sea and\r\nunknown to the folk of the country did not lead to some catastrophe.\r\nCallicratidas at once summoned the Lacedaemonians there present, and\r\naddressed them in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n (1) I.e. as some think, the Erechtheion, which was built partly on the\r\n    site of the old temple of Athena Polias, destroyed by the\r\n    Persians. According to Dr. Dorpfeld, a quite separate building of\r\n    the Doric order, the site of which (S. of the Erechtheion) has\r\n    lately been discovered.\r\n\r\n (2) The MSS. here add \"in the ephorate of Pityas and the archonship of\r\n    Callias at Athens;\" but though the date is probably correct (cf.\r\n    Leake, \"Topography of Athens,\" vol. i. p. 576 foll.), the words\r\n    are almost certainly a gloss.\r\n\r\n (3) Here the MSS. add \"with the twenty-fourth year of the war,\"\r\n    probably an annotator's gloss; the correct date should be twenty-\r\n    fifth. Pel. war 26 = B.C. 406. Pel. war 25 ended B.C. 407.\r\n\r\n (4) Lit. on the left (or east) of Samos, looking south from Ephesus.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" he said, \"I am content to stay at home: and if Lysander\r\nor any one else claim greater experience in nautical affairs than I\r\npossess, I have no desire to block his path. Only, being sent out by the\r\nState to take command of this fleet, I do not know what is left to\r\nme, save to carry out my instructions to the best of my ability. For\r\nyourselves, all I beg of you, in reference to my personal ambitions and\r\nthe kind of charges brought against our common city, and of which you\r\nare as well aware as I am, is to state what you consider to be the best\r\ncourse: am I to stay where I am, or shall I sail back home, and explain\r\nthe position of affairs out here?\"\r\n\r\nNo one ventured to suggest any other course than that he should obey the\r\nauthorities, and do what he was sent to do. Callicratidas then went up\r\nto the court of Cyrus to ask for further pay for the sailors, but\r\nthe answer he got from Cyrus was that he should wait for two days.\r\nCallicratidas was annoyed at the rebuff: to dance attendance at the\r\npalace gates was little to his taste. In a fit of anger he cried out\r\nat the sorry condition of the Hellenes, thus forced to flatter the\r\nbarbarian for the sake of money. \"If ever I get back home,\" he added,\r\n\"I will do what in me lies to reconcile the Athenians and the\r\nLacedaemonians.\" And so he turned and sailed back to Miletus. From\r\nMiletus he sent some triremes to Lacedaemon to get money, and convoking\r\nthe public assembly of the Milesians, addressed them thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Men of Miletus, necessity is laid upon me to obey the rulers at home;\r\nbut for yourselves, whose neighbourhood to the barbarians has exposed\r\nyou to many evils at their hands, I only ask you to let your zeal in the\r\nwar bear some proportion to your former sufferings. You should set\r\nan example to the rest of the allies, and show us how to inflict the\r\nsharpest and swiftest injury on our enemy, whilst we await the return\r\nfrom Lacedaemon of my envoys with the necessary funds. Since one of the\r\nlast acts of Lysander, before he left us, was to hand back to Cyrus the\r\nfunds already on the spot, as though we could well dispense with them. I\r\nwas thus forced to turn to Cyrus, but all I got from him was a series of\r\nrebuffs; he refused me an audience, and, for my part, I could not induce\r\nmyself to hang about his gates like a mendicant. But I give you my word,\r\nmen of Miletus, that in return for any assistance which you can render\r\nus while waiting for these aids, I will requite you richly. Only by\r\nGod's help let us show these barbarians that we do not need to worship\r\nthem, in order to punish our foes.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was effective; many members of the assembly arose, and not\r\nthe least eagerly those who were accused of opposing him. These, in some\r\nterror, proposed a vote of money, backed by offers of further private\r\ncontributions. Furnished with these sums, and having procured from Chios\r\na further remittance of five drachmas (5) a piece as outfit for each\r\nseaman, he set sail to Methyma in Lesbos, which was in the hands of the\r\nenemy. But as the Methymnaeans were not disposed to come over to him\r\n(since there was an Athenian garrison in the place, and the men at the\r\nhead of affairs were partisans of Athens), he assaulted and took the\r\nplace by storm. All the property within accordingly became the spoil of\r\nthe soldiers. The prisoners were collected for sale by Callicratidas\r\nin the market-place, where, in answer to the demand of the allies, who\r\ncalled upon him to sell the Methymnaeans also, he made answer, that as\r\nlong as he was in command, not a single Hellene should be enslaved if\r\nhe could help it. The next day he set at liberty the free-born captives;\r\nthe Athenian garrison with the captured slaves he sold. (6) To Conon\r\nhe sent word:--He would put a stop to his strumpeting the sea. (7) And\r\ncatching sight of him, as he put out to sea, at break of day, he gave\r\nchase, hoping to cut him off from his passage to Samos, and prevent his\r\ntaking refuge there.\r\n\r\n (5) About 4d.\r\n\r\n (6) Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. viii. p. 224 (2d ed.), thinks that\r\n    Callicratidas did not even sell the Athenian garrison, as if the\r\n    sense of the passage were: \"The next day he set at liberty the\r\n    free-born captives with the Athenian garrison, contenting himself\r\n    with selling the captive slaves.\" But I am afraid that no\r\n    ingenuity of stopping will extract that meaning from the Greek\r\n    words, which are, {te d' usteraia tous men eleutherous apheke tous\r\n    de ton 'Athenaion phrourous kai ta andrapoda ta doula panta\r\n    apedoto}. To spare the Athenian garrison would have been too\r\n    extraordinary a proceeding even for Callicratidas. The idea\r\n    probably never entered his head. It was sufficiently noble for him\r\n    to refuse to sell the Methymnaeans. See the remarks of Mr. W. L.\r\n    Newman, \"The Pol. of Aristotle,\" vol. i. p. 142.\r\n\r\n (7) I.e. the sea was Sparta's bride.\r\n\r\nBut Conon, aided by the sailing qualities of his fleet, the rowers of\r\nwhich were the pick of several ships' companies, concentrated in a few\r\nvessels, made good his escape, seeking shelter within the harbour of\r\nMitylene in Lesbos, and with him two of the ten generals, Leon and\r\nErasinides. Callicratidas, pursuing him with one hundred and seventy\r\nsail, entered the harbour simultaneously; and Conon thus hindered from\r\nfurther or final escape by the too rapid movements of the enemy, was\r\nforced to engage inside the harbour, and lost thirty of his ships,\r\nthough the crews escaped to land. The remaining, forty in number, he\r\nhauled up under the walls of the town. Callicratidas, on his side, came\r\nto moorings in the harbour; and, having command of the exit, blocked the\r\nAthenian within. His next step was to send for the Methymnaeans in force\r\nby land, and to transport his army across from Chios. Money also came to\r\nhim from Cyrus.\r\n\r\nConon, finding himself besieged by land and sea, without means of\r\nproviding himself with corn from any quarter, the city crowded with\r\ninhabitants, and aid from Athens, whither no news of the late events\r\ncould be conveyed, impossible, launched two of the fastest sailing\r\nvessels of his squadron. These he manned, before daybreak, with the best\r\nrowers whom he could pick out of the fleet, stowing away the marines at\r\nthe same time in the hold of the ships and closing the port shutters.\r\nEvery day for four days they held out in this fashion, but at evening as\r\nsoon as it was dark he disembarked his men, so that the enemy might not\r\nsuspect what they were after. On the fifth day, having got in a small\r\nstock of provisions, when it was already mid-day and the blockaders were\r\npaying little or no attention, and some of them even were taking their\r\nsiesta, the two ships sailed out of the harbour: the one directing her\r\ncourse towards the Hellespont, whilst her companion made for the open\r\nsea. Then, on the part of the blockaders, there was a rush to the scene\r\nof action, as fast as the several crews could get clear of land, in\r\nbustle and confusion, cutting away the anchors, and rousing themselves\r\nfrom sleep, for, as chance would have it, they had been breakfasting on\r\nshore. Once on board, however, they were soon in hot pursuit of the\r\nship which had started for the open sea, and ere the sun dipped they\r\noverhauled her, and after a successful engagement attached her by cables\r\nand towed her back into harbour, crew and all. Her comrade, making for\r\nthe Hellespont, escaped, and eventually reached Athens with news of\r\nthe blockade. The first relief was brought to the blockaded fleet by\r\nDiomedon, who anchored with twelve vessels in the Mitylenaean Narrows.\r\n(8) But a sudden attack of Callicratidas, who bore down upon him without\r\nwarning, cost him ten of his vessels, Diomedon himself escaping with his\r\nown ship and one other.\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"Euripus.\"\r\n\r\nNow that the position of affairs, including the blockade, was fully\r\nknown at Athens, a vote was passed to send out a reinforcement of one\r\nhundred and ten ships. Every man of ripe age, (9) whether slave or free,\r\nwas impressed for this service, so that within thirty days the whole one\r\nhundred and ten vessels were fully manned and weighed anchor. Amongst\r\nthose who served in this fleet were also many of the knights. (10)\r\nThe fleet at once stood out across to Samos, and picked up the Samian\r\nvessels in that island. The muster-roll was swelled by the addition of\r\nmore than thirty others from the rest of the allies, to whom the same\r\nprinciple of conscription applied, as also it did to the ships already\r\nengaged on foreign service. The actual total, therefore, when all the\r\ncontingents were collected, was over one hundred and fifty vessels.\r\n\r\n (9) I.e. from eighteen to sixty years.\r\n\r\n (10) See Boeckh. \"P. E. A.\" Bk. II. chap. xxi. p. 263 (Eng. trans.)\r\n\r\nCallicratidas, hearing that the relief squadron had already reached\r\nSamos, left fifty ships, under command of Eteonicus, in the harbour of\r\nMitylene, and setting sail with the other one hundred and twenty, hove\r\nto for the evening meal off Cape Malea in Lesbos, opposite Mitylene. It\r\nso happened that the Athenians on this day were supping on the islands\r\nof Arginusae, which lie opposite Lesbos. In the night the Spartan not\r\nonly saw their watch-fires, but received positive information that\r\n\"these were the Athenians;\" and about midnight he got under weigh,\r\nintending to fall upon them suddenly. But a violent downpour of rain\r\nwith thunder and lightning prevented him putting out to sea. By daybreak\r\nit had cleared, and he sailed towards Arginusae. On their side, the\r\nAthenian squadron stood out to meet him, with their left wing\r\nfacing towards the open sea, and drawn up in the following\r\norder:--Aristocrates, in command of the left wing, with fifteen ships,\r\nled the van; next came Diomedon with fifteen others, and immediately in\r\nrear of Aristocrates and Diomedon respectively, as their supports, came\r\nPericles and Erasinides. Parallel with Diomedon were the Samians, with\r\ntheir ten ships drawn up in single line, under the command of a Samian\r\nofficer named Hippeus. Next to these came the ten vessels of the\r\ntaxiarchs, also in single line, and supporting them, the three ships of\r\nthe navarchs, with any other allied vessels in the squadron. The right\r\nwing was entrusted to Protomachus with fifteen ships, and next to him\r\n(on the extreme right) was Thrasylus with another division of fifteen.\r\nProtomachus was supported by Lysias with an equal number of ships, and\r\nThrasylus by Aristogenes. The object of this formation was to prevent\r\nthe enemy from manouvring so as to break their line by striking them\r\namidships, (11) since they were inferior in sailing power.\r\n\r\n (11) Lit. \"by the diekplous.\" Cf. Thuc. i. 49, and Arnold's note, who\r\n    says: \"The 'diecplus' was a breaking through the enemy's line in\r\n    order by a rapid turning of the vessel to strike the enemy's ship\r\n    on the side or stern, where it was most defenceless, and so to\r\n    sink it.\" So, it seems, \"the superiority of nautical skill has\r\n    passed,\" as Grote (viii. p. 234) says, \"to the Peloponnesians and\r\n    their allies.\" Well may the historian add, \"How astonished would\r\n    the Athenian Admiral Phormion have been, if he could have\r\n    witnessed the fleets and the order of battle at Arginusae!\" See\r\n    Thuc. iv. 11.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians, on the contrary, trusting to their superior\r\nseamanship, were formed opposite with their ships all in single line,\r\nwith the special object of manouvring so as either to break the enemy's\r\nline or to wheel round them. Callicratidas commanded the right wing\r\nin person. Before the battle the officer who acted as his pilot, the\r\nMegarian Hermon, suggested that it might be well to withdraw the fleet\r\nas the Athenian ships were far more numerous. But Callicratidas replied\r\nthat Sparta would be no worse off even if he personally should perish,\r\nbut to flee would be disgraceful. (12) And now the fleets approached,\r\nand for a long space the battle endured. At first the vessels were\r\nengaged in crowded masses, and later on in scattered groups. At length\r\nCallicratidas, as his vessel dashed her beak into her antagonist,\r\nwas hurled off into the sea and disappeared. At the same instant\r\nProtomachus, with his division on the right, had defeated the enemy's\r\nleft, and then the flight of the Peloponnesians began towards Chios,\r\nthough a very considerable body of them made for Phocaea, whilst the\r\nAthenians sailed back again to Arginusae. The losses on the side of the\r\nAthenians were twenty-five ships, crews and all, with the exception of\r\nthe few who contrived to reach dry land. On the Peloponnesian side, nine\r\nout of the ten Lacedaemonian ships, and more than sixty belonging to the\r\nrest of the allied squadron, were lost.\r\n\r\n (12) For the common reading, {oikeitai}, which is ungrammatical,\r\n    various conjectures have been made, e.g.\r\n\r\n      {oikieitai} = \"would be none the worse off for citizens,\"\r\n      {oikesetai} = \"would be just as well administered without him,\"\r\n\r\n    but as the readings and their renderings are alike doubtful, I\r\n    have preferred to leave the matter vague. Cf. Cicero, \"De Offic.\"\r\n    i. 24; Plutarch, \"Lac. Apophth.\" p. 832.\r\n\r\nAfter consultation the Athenian generals agreed that two captains\r\nof triremes, Theramenes and Thrasybulus, accompanied by some of the\r\ntaxiarchs, should take forty-seven ships and sail to the assistance\r\nof the disabled fleet and of the men on board, whilst the rest of the\r\nsquadron proceeded to attack the enemy's blockading squadron under\r\nEteonicus at Mitylene. In spite of their desire to carry out this\r\nresolution, the wind and a violent storm which arose prevented them. So\r\nthey set up a trophy, and took up their quarters for the night. As to\r\nEtenoicus, the details of the engagement were faithfully reported to\r\nhim by the express despatch-boat in attendance. On receipt of the news,\r\nhowever, he sent the despatch-boat out again the way she came, with\r\nan injunction to those on board of her to sail off quickly without\r\nexchanging a word with any one. Then on a sudden they were to return\r\ngarlanded with wreaths of victory and shouting \"Callicratidas has won\r\na great sea fight, and the whole Athenian squadron is destroyed.\" This\r\nthey did, and Eteonicus, on his side, as soon as the despatch-boat came\r\nsailing in, proceeded to offer sacrifice of thanksgiving in honour of\r\nthe good news. Meanwhile he gave orders that the troops were to take\r\ntheir evening meal, and that the masters of the trading ships were\r\nsilently to stow away their goods on board the merchant ships and make\r\nsail as fast as the favourable breeze could speed them to Chios. The\r\nships of war were to follow suit with what speed they might. This done,\r\nhe set fire to his camp, and led off the land forces to Methymna. Conon,\r\nfinding the enemy had made off, and the wind had grown comparatively\r\nmild, (13) got his ships afloat, and so fell in with the Athenian\r\nsquadron, which had by this time set out from Arginusae. To these he\r\nexplained the proceedings of Eteonicus. The squadron put into Mitylene,\r\nand from Mitylene stood across to Chios, and thence, without effecting\r\nanything further, sailed back to Samos.\r\n\r\n (13) Or, \"had changed to a finer quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAll the above-named generals, with the exception of Conon, were\r\npresently deposed by the home authorities. In addition to Conon two new\r\ngenerals were chosen, Adeimantus and Philocles. Of those concerned in\r\nthe late victory two never returned to Athens: these were Protomachus\r\nand Aristogenes. The other six sailed home. Their names were Pericles,\r\nDiomedon, Lysias, Aristocrates, Thrasylus, and Erasinides. On their\r\narrival Archidemus, the leader of the democracy at that date, who had\r\ncharge of the two obol fund, (1) inflicted a fine on Erasinides, and\r\naccused him before the Dicastery (2) of having appropriated money\r\nderived from the Hellespont, which belonged to the people. He brought\r\na further charge against him of misconduct while acting as general, and\r\nthe court sentenced him to imprisonment.\r\n\r\n (1) Reading {tes diobelais}, a happy conjecture for the MSS. {tes\r\n    diokelias}, which is inexplicable. See Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\"\r\n    vol. viii. p. 244 note (2d ed.)\r\n\r\n (2) I.e. a legal tribunal or court of law. At Athens the free citizens\r\n    constitutionally sworn and impannelled sat as \"dicasts\"\r\n    (\"jurymen,\" or rather as a bench of judges) to hear cases\r\n    ({dikai}). Any particular board of dicasts formed a \"dicastery.\"\r\n\r\nThese proceedings in the law court were followed by the statement of\r\nthe generals before the senate (3) touching the late victory and the\r\nmagnitude of the storm. Timocrates then proposed that the other\r\nfive generals should be put in custody and handed over to the public\r\nassembly. (4) Whereupon the senate committed them all to prison. Then\r\ncame the meeting of the public assembly, in which others, and more\r\nparticularly Theramenes, formally accused the generals. He insisted\r\nthat they ought to show cause why they had not picked up the shipwrecked\r\ncrews. To prove that there had been no attempt on their part to attach\r\nblame to others, he might point, as conclusive testimony, to the\r\ndespatch sent by the generals themselves to the senate and the people,\r\nin which they attributed the whole disaster to the storm, and nothing\r\nelse. After this the generals each in turn made a defence, which was\r\nnecessarily limited to a few words, since no right of addressing\r\nthe assembly at length was allowed by law. Their explanation of the\r\noccurrences was that, in order to be free to sail against the enemy\r\nthemselves, they had devolved the duty of picking up the shipwrecked\r\ncrews upon certain competent captains of men-of-war, who had themselves\r\nbeen generals in their time, to wit Theramenes and Tharysbulus, and\r\nothers of like stamp. If blame could attach to any one at all with\r\nregard to the duty in question, those to whom their orders had been\r\ngiven were the sole persons they could hold responsible. \"But,\" they\r\nwent on to say, \"we will not, because these very persons have denounced\r\nus, invent a lie, and say that Theramenes and Thrasybulus are to blame,\r\nwhen the truth of the matter is that the magnitude of the storm alone\r\nprevented the burial of the dead and the rescue of the living.\" In\r\nproof of their contention, they produced the pilots and numerous other\r\nwitnesses from among those present at the engagement. By these arguments\r\nthey were in a fair way to persuade the people of their innocence.\r\nIndeed many private citizens rose wishing to become bail for the\r\naccused, but it was resolved to defer decision till another meeting\r\nof the assembly. It was indeed already so late that it would have been\r\nimpossible to see to count the show of hands. It was further resolved\r\nthat the senate meanwhile should prepare a measure, to be introduced at\r\nthe next assembly, as to the mode in which the accused should take their\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n (3) This is the Senate or Council of Five Hundred. One of its chief\r\n    duties was to prepare measures for discussion in the assembly. It\r\n    had also a certain amount of judicial power, hearing complaints\r\n    and inflicting fines up to fifty drachmas. It sat daily, a\r\n    \"prytany\" of fifty members of each of the ten tribes in rotation\r\n    holding office for a month in turn.\r\n\r\n (4) This is the great Public Assembly (the Ecclesia), consisting of\r\n    all genuine Athenian citizens of more than twenty years of age.\r\n\r\nThen came the festival of the Aparturia, (5) with its family gatherings\r\nof fathers and kinsfolk. Accordingly the party of Theramenes procured\r\nnumbers of people clad in black apparel, and close-shaven, (6) who were\r\nto go in and present themselves before the public assembly in the middle\r\nof the festival, as relatives, presumably, of the men who had perished;\r\nand they persuaded Callixenus to accuse the generals in the senate. The\r\nnext step was to convoke the assembly, when the senate laid before it\r\nthe proposal just passed by their body, at the instance of Callixenus,\r\nwhich ran as follows: \"Seeing that both the parties to this case, to\r\nwit, the prosecutors of the generals on the one hand, and the accused\r\nthemselves in their defence on the other, have been heard in the late\r\nmeeting of the assembly; we propose that the people of Athens now record\r\ntheir votes, one and all, by their tribes; that a couple of voting urns\r\nbe placed for the convenience of each several tribe; and the public\r\ncrier in the hearing of each several tribe proclaim the mode of voting\r\nas follows: 'Let every one who finds the generals guilty of not rescuing\r\nthe heroes of the late sea fight deposit his vote in urn No. 1. Let him\r\nwho is of the contrary opinion deposit his vote in urn No. 2. Further,\r\nin the event of the aforesaid generals being found guilty, let death be\r\nthe penalty. Let the guilty persons be delivered over to the eleven. Let\r\ntheir property be confiscated to the State, with the exception of one\r\ntithe, which falls to the goddess.'\"\r\n\r\n (5) An important festival held in October at Athens, and in nearly all\r\n    Ionic cities. Its objects were (1) the recognition of a common\r\n    descent from Ion, the son of Apollo Patrous; and (2) the\r\n    maintenance of the ties of clanship. See Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\"\r\n    vol. viii. p. 260 foll. (2d ed.); Jebb, \"Theophr.\" xviii. 5.\r\n\r\n (6) I.e. in sign of mourning.\r\n\r\nNow there came forward in the assembly a man, who said that he had\r\nescaped drowning by clinging to a meal tub. The poor fellows perishing\r\naround him had commissioned him, if he succeeded in saving himself,\r\nto tell the people of Athens how bravely they had fought for their\r\nfatherland, and how the generals had left them there to drown.\r\n\r\nPresently Euryptolemus, the son of Peisianax, and others served a\r\nnotice of indictment on Callixenus, insisting that his proposal was\r\nunconstitutional, and this view of the case was applauded by some\r\nmembers of the assembly. But the majority kept crying out that it was\r\nmonstrous if the people were to be hindered by any stray individual from\r\ndoing what seemed to them right. And when Lysicus, embodying the spirit\r\nof those cries, formally proposed that if these persons would not\r\nabandon their action, they should be tried by the same vote along with\r\nthe generals: a proposition to which the mob gave vociferous assent; and\r\nso these were compelled to abandon their summonses. Again, when some of\r\nthe Prytanes (7) objected to put a resolution to the vote which was in\r\nitself unconstitutional, Callixenus again got up and accused them in the\r\nsame terms, and the shouting began again. \"Yes, summons all who refuse,\"\r\nuntil the Prytanes, in alarm, all agreed with one exception to permit\r\nthe voting. This obstinate dissentient was Socrates, the son of\r\nSophroniscus, who insisted that he would do nothing except in accordance\r\nwith the law. (8) After this Euryptolemus rose and spoke in behalf of\r\nthe generals. He said:--\r\n\r\n (7) Prytanes--the technical term for the senators of the presiding\r\n    tribe, who acted as presidents of the assembly. Their chairman for\r\n    the day was called Epistates.\r\n\r\n (8) For the part played by Socrates see further Xenophon's\r\n    \"Memorabilia,\" I. i. 18; IV. iv. 2.\r\n\r\n\"I stand here, men of Athens, partly to accuse Pericles, though he is a\r\nclose and intimate connection of my own, and Diomedon, who is my friend,\r\nand partly to urge certain considerations on their behalf, but chiefly\r\nto press upon you what seems to me the best course for the State\r\ncollectively. I hold them to blame in that they dissuaded their\r\ncolleagues from their intention to send a despatch to the senate and\r\nthis assembly, which should have informed you of the orders given to\r\nTheramenes and Thrasybulus to take forty-seven ships of war and pick up\r\nthe shipwrecked crews, and of the neglect of the two officers to carry\r\nout those orders. And it follows that though the offence was committed\r\nby one or two, the responsibility must be shared by all; and in return\r\nfor kindness in the past, they are in danger at present of sacrificing\r\ntheir lives to the machinations of these very men, and others whom I\r\ncould mention. In danger, do I say, of losing their lives? No, not so,\r\nif you will suffer me to persuade you to do what is just and right; if\r\nyou will only adopt such a course as shall enable you best to discover\r\nthe truth and shall save you from too late repentance, when you find you\r\nhave transgressed irremediably against heaven and your own selves. In\r\nwhat I urge there is no trap nor plot whereby you can be deceived by me\r\nor any other man; it is a straightforward course which will enable\r\nyou to discover and punish the offender by whatever process you like,\r\ncollectively or individually. Let them have, if not more, at any rate\r\none whole day to make what defence they can for themselves; and trust to\r\nyour own unbiased judgment to guide you to the right conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"You know, men of Athens, the exceeding stringency of the decree of\r\nCannonus, (9) which orders that man, whosoever he be, who is guilty of\r\ntreason against the people of Athens, to be put in irons, and so to meet\r\nthe charge against him before the people. If he be convicted, he is to\r\nbe thrown into the Barathron and perish, and the property of such an one\r\nis to be confiscated, with the exception of the tithe which falls to the\r\ngoddess. I call upon you to try these generals in accordance with this\r\ndecree. Yes, and so help me God--if it please you, begin with my own\r\nkinsman Pericles for base would it be on my part to make him of more\r\naccount than the whole of the State. Or, if you prefer, try them by that\r\nother law, which is directed against robbers of temples and betrayers\r\nof their country, which says: if a man betray his city or rob a sacred\r\ntemple of the gods, he shall be tried before a law court, and if he be\r\nconvicted, his body shall not be buried in Attica, and his goods shall\r\nbe confiscated to the State. Take your choice as between these two laws,\r\nmen of Athens, and let the prisoners be tried by one or other. Let three\r\nportions of a day be assigned to each respectively, one portion wherein\r\nthey shall listen to their accusation, a second wherein they shall make\r\ntheir defence, and a third wherein you shall meet and give your votes in\r\ndue order on the question of their guilt or innocence. By this procedure\r\nthe malefactors will receive the desert of their misdeeds in full, and\r\nthose who are innocent will owe you, men of Athens, the recovery of\r\ntheir liberty, in place of unmerited destruction. (10)\r\n\r\n (9) \"There was a rule in Attic judicial procedure, called the psephism\r\n    of Kannonus (originally adopted, we do not know when, on the\r\n    proposition of a citizen of that name, as a psephism or decree for\r\n    some particular case, but since generalised into common practice,\r\n    and grown into great prescriptive reverence), which peremptorily\r\n    forbade any such collective trial or sentence, and directed that a\r\n    separate judicial vote should in all cases be taken for or against\r\n    each accused party.\" Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. viii. p. 266\r\n    (2d ed.)\r\n\r\n (10) Reading {adikos apolountai}.\r\n\r\n\"On your side, in trying the accused by recognised legal procedure, you\r\nwill show that you obey the dictates of pious feeling, and can regard\r\nthe sanctity of an oath, instead of joining hands with our enemies the\r\nLacedaemonians and fighting their battles. For is it not to fight their\r\nbattles, if you take their conquerors, the men who deprived them of\r\nseventy vessels, and at the moment of victory sent them to perdition\r\nuntried and in the teeth of the law? What are you afraid of, that you\r\npress forward with such hot haste? Do you imagine that you may be\r\nrobbed of the power of life and death over whom you please, should you\r\ncondescend to a legal trial? but that you are safe if you take shelter\r\nbehind an illegality, like the illegality of Callixenus, when he worked\r\nupon the senate to propose to this assembly to deal with the accused by\r\na single vote? But consider, you may actually put to death an innocent\r\nman, and then repentance will one day visit you too late. Bethink you\r\nhow painful and unavailing remorse will then be, and more particularly\r\nif your error has cost a fellow-creature his life. What a travesty of\r\njustice it would be if in the case of a man like Aristarchus, (11) who\r\nfirst tried to destroy the democracy and then betrayed Oenoe to our\r\nenemy the Thebans, you granted him a day for his defence, consulting his\r\nwishes, and conceded to him all the other benefits of the law; whereas\r\nnow you are proposing to deprive of these same privileges your own\r\ngenerals, who in every way conformed to your views and defeated your\r\nenemies. Do not you, of all men, I implore you, men of Athens, act thus.\r\nWhy, these laws are your own, to them, beyond all else you owe your\r\ngreatness. Guard them jealously; in nothing, I implore you, act without\r\ntheir sanction.\r\n\r\n (11) See below, II. iii; also cf. Thuc. viii. 90, 98.\r\n\r\n\"But now, turn for a moment and consider with me the actual occurrences\r\nwhich have created the suspicion of misconduct on the part of our late\r\ngenerals. The sea-fight had been fought and won, and the ships had\r\nreturned to land, when Diomedon urged that the whole squadron should\r\nsail out in line and pick up the wrecks and floating crews. Erasinides\r\nwas in favour of all the vessels sailing as fast as possible to deal\r\nwith the enemy's forces at Mitylene. And Thrasylus represented that both\r\nobjects could be effected, by leaving one division of the fleet there,\r\nand with the rest sailing against the enemy; and if this resolution were\r\nagreed to, he advised that each of the eight generals should leave three\r\nships of his own division with the ten vessels of the taxiarchs, the\r\nten Samian vessels, and the three belonging to the navarchs. These added\r\ntogether make forty-seven, four for each of the lost vessels, twelve\r\nin number. Among the taxiarchs left behind, two were Thrasybulus and\r\nTheramenes, the men who in the late meeting of this assembly undertook\r\nto accuse the generals. With the remainder of the fleet they were to\r\nsail to attack the enemy's fleet. Everything, you must admit, was duly\r\nand admirably planned. It was only common justice, therefore, that those\r\nwhose duty it was to attack the enemy should render an account for\r\nall miscarriages of operations against the enemy; while those who were\r\ncommissioned to pick up the dead and dying should, if they failed to\r\ncarry out the instructions of the generals, be put on trial to explain\r\nthe reasons of the failure. This indeed I may say in behalf of both\r\nparites. It was really the storm which, in spite of what the generals\r\nhad planned, prevented anything being done. There are witnesses ready to\r\nattest the truth of this: the men who escaped as by a miracle, and among\r\nthese one of these very generals, who was on a sinking ship and was\r\nsaved. And this man, who needed picking up as much as anybody at that\r\nmoment, is, they insist, to be tried by one and the same vote as those\r\nwho neglected to perform their orders! Once more, I beg you, men\r\nof Athens, to accept your victory and your good fortune, instead of\r\nbehaving like the desperate victims of misfortune and defeat.\r\nRecognise the finger of divine necessity; do not incur the reproach\r\nof stony-heartedness by discovering treason where there was merely\r\npowerlessness, and condemning as guilty those who were prevented by the\r\nstorm from carrying out their instructions. Nay! you will better satisfy\r\nthe demands of justice by crowning these conquerors with wreaths of\r\nvictory than by punishing them with death at the instigation of wicked\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of his speech Euryptolemus proposed, as an amendment,\r\nthat the prisoners should, in accordance with the decree of Cannonus, be\r\ntried each separately, as against the proposal of the senate to try them\r\nall by a single vote.\r\n\r\nAt the show of hands the tellers gave the majority in favour of\r\nEuryptolemus's amendment, but upon the application of Menecles, who\r\ntook formal exception (12) to this decision, the show of hands was gone\r\nthrough again, and now the verdict was in favour of the resolution of\r\nthe senate. At a later date the balloting was made, and by the votes\r\nrecorded the eight generals were condemned, and the six who were in\r\nAthens were put to death.\r\n\r\n (12) For this matter cf. Schomann, \"De Comitiis Athen.\" p. 161 foll.;\r\n    also Grote, \"Hist. of Grece,\" vol. viii. p. 276 note (2d ed.)\r\n\r\nNot long after, repentance seized the Athenians, and they passed a\r\ndecree authorising the public prosecution of those who had deceived the\r\npeople, and the appointment of proper securities for their persons until\r\nthe trial was over. Callixenus was one of those committed for trail.\r\nThere were, besides Callixenus, four others against whom true bills were\r\ndeclared, and they were all five imprisoned by their sureties. But all\r\nsubsequently effected their escape before the trial, at the time of the\r\nsedition in which Cleophon (13) was killed. Callixenus eventually came\r\nback when the party in Piraeus returned to the city, at the date of\r\nthe amnesty, (14) but only to die of hunger, an object of universal\r\ndetestation.\r\n\r\n (13) Cleophon, the well-known demagogue. For the occasion of his death\r\n    see Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. viii. pp. 166, 310 (2d ed.);\r\n    Prof. Jebb, \"Attic Orators,\" i. 266, ii. 288. For his character,\r\n    as popularly conceived, cf. Aristoph. \"Frogs,\" 677.\r\n\r\n (14) B.C. 403.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTo return to Eteonicus and his troops in Chios. During summer they\r\nwere well able to support themselves on the fruits of the season, or\r\nby labouring for hire in different parts of the island, but with the\r\napproach of winter these means of subsistence began to fail. Ill-clad at\r\nthe same time, and ill-shod, they fell to caballing and arranging plans\r\nto attack the city of Chios. It was agreed amongst them, that in order\r\nto gauge their numbers, every member of the conspiracy should carry a\r\nreed. Eteonicus got wind of the design, but was at a loss how to deal\r\nwith it, considering the number of these reed-bearers. To make an open\r\nattack upon them seemed dangerous. It would probably lead to a rush\r\nto arms, in which the conspirators would seize the city and commence\r\nhostilities, and, in the event of their success, everything hitherto\r\nachieved would be lost. Or again, the destruction on his part of many\r\nfellow-creatures and allies was a terrible alternative, which would\r\nplace the Spartans in an unenviable light with regard to the rest of\r\nHellas, and render the soldiers ill-disposed to the cause in hand.\r\nAccordingly he took with him fifteen men, armed with daggers, and\r\nmarched through the city. Falling in with one of the reed-bearers, a man\r\nsuffering from ophthalmia, who was returning from the surgeon's house,\r\nhe put him to death. This led to some uproar, and people asked why the\r\nman was thus slain. By Eteonicus's orders the answer was set afloat,\r\n\"because he carried a reed.\" As the explanation circulated, one\r\nreed-bearer after another threw away the symbol, each one saying to\r\nhimself, as he heard the reason given, \"I have better not be seen with\r\nthis.\" After a while Eteonicus called a meeting of the Chians, and\r\nimposed upon them a contribution of money, on the ground that with pay\r\nin their pockets the sailors would have no temptation to revolutionary\r\nprojects. The Chians acquiesced. Whereupon Eteonicus promptly ordered\r\nhis crews to get on board their vessels. He then rowed alongside\r\neach ship in turn, and addressed the men at some length in terms of\r\nencouragement and cheery admonition, just as though he knew nothing of\r\nwhat had taken place, and so distributed a month's pay to every man on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Chians and the other allies held a meeting in Ephesus,\r\nand, considering the present posture of affairs, determined to send\r\nambassadors to Lacedaemon with a statement of the facts, and a request\r\nthat Lysander might be sent out to take command of the fleet. Lysander's\r\nhigh reputation among the allies dated back to his former period of\r\noffice, when as admiral he had won the naval victory of Notium. The\r\nambassadors accordingly were despatched, accompanied by envoys also from\r\nCyrus, charged with the same message. The Lacedaemonians responded by\r\nsending them Lysander as second in command, (1) with Aracus as admiral,\r\nsince it was contrary to their custom that the same man should be\r\nadmiral twice. At the same time the fleet was entrusted to Lysander. (2)\r\n\r\n (1) Epistoleus. See above.\r\n\r\n (2) \"At this date the war had lasted five-and-twenty years.\" So the\r\n    MSS. read. The words are probably an interpolation.\r\n\r\nIt was in this year (3) that Cyrus put Autoboesaces and Mitraeus to\r\ndeath. These were sons of the sister of Dariaeus (4) (the daughter of\r\nXerxes, the father of Darius). (5) He put them to death for neglecting,\r\nwhen they met him, to thrust their hands into the sleeve (or \"kore\")\r\nwhich is a tribute of respect paid to the king alone. This \"kore\" is\r\nlonger than the ordinary sleeve, so long in fact that a man with his\r\nhand inside is rendered helpless. In consequence of this act on the part\r\nof Cyrus, Hieramenes (6) and his wife urged upon Dariaeus the danger of\r\noverlooking such excessive insolence on the part of the young prince,\r\nand Dariaeus, on the plea of sickness, sent a special embassy to summon\r\nCyrus to his bedside.\r\n\r\n (3) B.C. 406.\r\n\r\n (4) Dariaeus, i.e. Darius, but the spelling of the name is correct,\r\n    and occurs in Ctesias, though in the \"Anabasis\" we have the\r\n    spelling Darius.\r\n\r\n (5) These words look like the note of a foolish and ignorant scribe.\r\n    He ought to have written, \"The daughter of Artaxerxes and own\r\n    sister of Darius, commonly so called.\"\r\n\r\n (6) For Hieramenes cf. Thuc. viii. 95, and Prof. Jowett ad loc.\r\n\r\nB.C. 405. In the following year (7) Lysander arrived at Ephesus, and\r\nsent for Eteonicus with his ships from Chios, and collected all other\r\nvessels elsewhere to be found. His time was now devoted to refitting the\r\nold ships and having new ones built in Antandrus. He also made a journey\r\nto the court of Cyrus with a request for money. All Cyrus could say\r\nwas, that not only the money sent by the king was spent, but much more\r\nbesides; and he pointed out the various sums which each of the admirals\r\nhad received, but at the same time he gave him what he asked for.\r\nFurnished with this money, Lysander appointed captains to the different\r\nmen-of-war, and remitted to the sailors their arrears of pay. Meanwhile\r\nthe Athenian generals, on their side, were devoting their energies to\r\nthe improvements of their navy at Samos.\r\n\r\n (7) The MSS. add \"during the ephorate of Archytas and the archonship\r\n    at Athens of Alexias,\" which, though correct enough, is probably\r\n    an interpolation.\r\n\r\nIt was now Cyrus's turn to send for Lysander. It was the moment at which\r\nthe envoy from his father had arrived with the message: \"Your father is\r\non his sick-bed and desires your presence.\" The king lay at Thamneria,\r\nin Media, near the territory of the Cadusians, against whom he had\r\nmarched to put down a revolt. When Lysander presented himself, Cyrus was\r\nurgent with him not to engage the Athenians at sea unless he had many\r\nmore ships than they. \"The king,\" he added, \"and I have plenty of\r\nwealth, so that, as far as money goes, you can man plenty of vessels.\"\r\nHe then consigned to him all the tributes from the several cities which\r\nbelonged to him personally, and gave him the ready money which he had\r\nas a gift; and finally, reminding him of the sincere friendship he\r\nentertained towards the state of Lacedaemon, as well as to himself\r\npersonally, he set out up country to visit his father. Lysander, finding\r\nhimself thus left with the complete control of the property of Cyrus\r\n(during the absence of that prince, so summoned to the bedside of his\r\nfather), was able to distribute pay to his troops, after which he set\r\nsail for the Ceramic Gulf of Caria. Here he stormed a city in alliance\r\nwith the Athenians named Cedreae, and on the following day's assault\r\ntook it, and reduced the inhabitants to slavery. These were of a mixed\r\nHellene and barbaric stock. From Cedreae he continued his voyage\r\nto Rhodes. The Athenians meanwhile, using Samos as their base of\r\noperations, were employed in devastating the king's territory, or in\r\nswooping down upon Chios and Ephesus, and in general were preparing for\r\na naval battle, having but lately chosen three new generals in addition\r\nto those already in office, whose names were Menander, Tydeus, and\r\nCephisodotus. Now Lysander, leaving Rhodes, and coasting along Ionia,\r\nmade his way to the Hellespont, having an eye to the passage of vessels\r\nthrough the Straits, and, in a more hostile sense, on the cities which\r\nhad revolted from Sparta. The Athenians also set sail from Chios, but\r\nstood out to open sea, since the seaboard of Asia was hostile to them.\r\n\r\nLysander was again on the move; leaving Abydos, he passed up channel to\r\nLampsacus, which town was allied with Athens; the men of Abydos and\r\nthe rest of the troops advancing by land, under the command of the\r\nLacedaemonian Thorax. They then attacked and took by storm the town,\r\nwhich was wealthy, and with its stores of wine and wheat and other\r\ncommodities was pillaged by the soldiery. All free-born persons,\r\nhowever, were without exception released by Lysander. And now the\r\nAthenian fleet, following close on his heels, came to moorings at\r\nElaeus, in the Chersonesus, one hundred and eighty sail in all. It was\r\nnot until they had reached this place, and were getting their early\r\nmeal, that the news of what had happened at Lampsacus reached them. Then\r\nthey instantly set sail again to Sestos, and, having halted long enough\r\nmerely to take in stores, sailed on further to Aegospotami, a point\r\nfacing Lampsacus, where the Hellespont is not quite two miles (8) broad.\r\nHere they took their evening meal.\r\n\r\n (8) Lit. fifteen stades.\r\n\r\nThe night following, or rather early next morning, with the first streak\r\nof dawn, Lysander gave the signal for the men to take their breakfasts\r\nand get on board their vessels; and so, having got all ready for a naval\r\nengagement, with his ports closed and movable bulwarks attached, he\r\nissued the order that no one was to stir from his post or put out to\r\nsea. As the sun rose the Athenians drew up their vessels facing the\r\nharbour, in line of battle ready for action; but Lysander declining\r\nto come out to meet them, as the day advanced they retired again to\r\nAegospotami. Then Lysander ordered the swiftest of his ships to follow\r\nthe Athenians, and as soon as the crews had disembarked, to watch what\r\nthey did, sail back, and report to him. Until these look-outs returned\r\nhe would permit no disembarkation from his ships. This performance he\r\nrepeated for four successive days, and each day the Athenians put out to\r\nsea and challenged an engagement.\r\n\r\nBut now Alcibiades, from one of his fortresses, could espy the position\r\nof his fellow-countrymen, moored on an open beach beyond reach of any\r\ncity, and forced to send for supplies to Sestos, which was nearly two\r\nmiles distant, while their enemies were safely lodged in a harbour, with\r\na city adjoining, and everything within reach. The situation did not\r\nplease him, and he advised them to shift their anchorage to Sestos,\r\nwhere they would have the advantage of a harbour and a city. \"Once\r\nthere,\" he concluded, \"you can engage the enemy whenever it suits you.\"\r\nBut the generals, and more particularly Tydeus and Menander, bade him go\r\nabout his business. \"We are generals now--not you,\" they said; and so he\r\nwent away. And now for five days in succession the Athenians had sailed\r\nout to offer battle, and for the fifth time retired, followed by the\r\nsame swift sailors of the enemy. But this time Lysander's orders to the\r\nvessels so sent in pursuit were, that as soon as they saw the\r\nenemy's crew fairly disembarked and dispersed along the shores of the\r\nChersonesus (a practice, it should be mentioned, which had grown upon\r\nthem from day to day owing to the distance at which eatables had to be\r\npurchased, and out of sheer contempt, no doubt, of Lysander, who refused\r\nto accept battle), they were to begin their return voyage, and when in\r\nmid-channel to hoist a shield. The orders were punctually carried out,\r\nand Lysander at once signalled to his whole squadron to put across with\r\nall speed, while Thorax, with the land forces, was to march parallel\r\nwith the fleet along the coast. Aware of the enemy's fleet, which he\r\ncould see bearing down upon him, Conon had only time to signal to the\r\ncrews to join their ships and rally to the rescue with all their might.\r\nBut the men were scattered far and wide, and some of the vessels had\r\nonly two out of their three banks of rowers, some only a single one,\r\nwhile others again were completely empty. Conon's own ship, with seven\r\nothers in attendance on him and the \"Paralus,\" (9) put out to sea, a\r\nlittle cluster of nine vessels, with their full complement of men; but\r\nevery one of the remaining one hundred and seventy-one vessels were\r\ncaptured by Lysander on the beach. As to the men themselves, the\r\nlarge majority of them were easily made prisoners on shore, a few only\r\nescaping to the small fortresses of the neighbourhood. Meanwhile Conon\r\nand his nine vessels made good their escape. For himself, knowing that\r\nthe fortune of Athens was ruined, he put into Abarnis, the promontory of\r\nLampsacus, and there picked up the great sails of Lysander's ships, and\r\nthen with eight ships set sail himself to seek refuge with Evagoras in\r\nCyprus, while the \"Paralus\" started for Athens with tidings of what had\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n (9) The \"Paralus\"--the Athenian sacred vessel; cf. Thuc. iii. 33 et\r\n    passim.\r\n\r\nLysander, on his side, conveyed the ships and prisoners and all other\r\nspoil back to Lampsacus, having on board some of the Athenian generals,\r\nnotably Philocles and Adeimantus. On the very day of these achievements\r\nhe despatched Theopompus, a Milesian privateersman, to Lacedaemon to\r\nreport what had taken place. This envoy arrived within three days and\r\ndelivered his message. Lysander's next step was to convene the allies\r\nand bid them deliberate as to the treatment of the prisoners. Many were\r\nthe accusations here levied against the Athenians. There was talk of\r\ncrimes committed against the law of Hellas, and of cruelties sanctioned\r\nby popular decrees; which, had they conquered in the late sea-fight,\r\nwould have been carried out; such as the proposal to cut off the right\r\nhand of every prisoner taken alive, and lastly the ill-treatment of two\r\ncaptured men-of-war, a Corinthian and an Andrian vessel, when every man\r\non board had been hurled headlong down the cliff. Philocles was the very\r\ngeneral of the Athenians who had so ruthlessly destroyed those men. Many\r\nother tales were told; and at length a resolution was passed to put all\r\nthe Athenian prisoners, with the exception of Adeimantus, to death. He\r\nalone, it was pleaded, had taken exception to the proposal to cut off\r\nthe prisoners' hands. On the other hand, he was himself accused by some\r\npeople of having betrayed the fleet. As to Philocles, Lysander put to\r\nhim one question, as the officer who had thrown (10) the Corinthians and\r\nAndrians down the cliff: What fate did the man deserve to suffer who\r\nhad embarked on so cruel a course of illegality against Hellenes? and so\r\ndelivered him to the executioner.\r\n\r\n (10) Reading {os... katekremnise}.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen he had set the affairs of Lampsacus in order, Lysander sailed to\r\nByzantium and Chalcedon, where the inhabitants, having first dismissed\r\nthe Athenian garrison under a flag of truce, admitted him within their\r\nwalls. Those citizens of Byzantium, who had betrayed Byzantium into\r\nthe hands of Alcibiades, fled as exiles into Pontus, but subsequently\r\nbetaking themselves to Athens, became Athenian citizens. In dealing with\r\nthe Athenian garrisons, and indeed with all Athenians wheresoever found,\r\nLysander made it a rule to give them safe conduct to Athens, and to\r\nAthens only, in the certainty that the larger the number collected\r\nwithin the city and Piraeus, the more quickly the want of necessaries of\r\nlife would make itself felt. And now, leaving Sthenelaus, a Laconian, as\r\ngovernor-general of Byzantium and Chalcedon, he sailed back himself to\r\nLampsacus and devoted himself to refitting his ships.\r\n\r\nIt was night when the \"Paralus\" reached Athens with her evil tidings,\r\non receipt of which a bitter wail of woe broke forth. From Piraeus,\r\nfollowing the line of the long walls up to the heart of the city, it\r\nswept and swelled, as each man to his neighbour passed on the news. On\r\nthat night no man slept. There was mourning and sorrow for those that\r\nwere lost, but the lamentation for the dead was merged in even deeper\r\nsorrow for themselves, as they pictured the evils they were about to\r\nsuffer, the like of which they themselves had inflicted upon the men of\r\nMelos, who were colonists of the Lacedaemonians, when they mastered\r\nthem by siege. Or on the men of Histiaea; on Scione and Torone; on the\r\nAeginetans, and many another Hellene city. (1) On the following day the\r\npublic assembly met, and, after debate, it was resolved to block up all\r\nthe harbours save one, to put the walls in a state of defence, to post\r\nguards at various points, and to make all other necessary preparations\r\nfor a siege. Such were the concerns of the men of Athens.\r\n\r\n (1) With regard to these painful recollections, see (1) for the siege\r\n    and surrender of Melos (in B.C. 416), Thuc. v. 114, 116; and cf.\r\n    Aristoph. \"Birds,\" 186; Plut. (\"Lysander,\" 14); (2) for the\r\n    ejection of the Histiaeans, an incident of the recovery of Euboea\r\n    in 445 B.C., see Thuc. i. 14; Plut. (\"Pericles,\" 23); (3) for the\r\n    matter of Scione, which revolted in 423 B.C., and was for a long\r\n    time a source of disagreement between the Athenians and\r\n    Lacedaemonians, until finally captured by the former in 421 B.C.,\r\n    when the citizens were slain and the city given to the Plataeans,\r\n    see Thuc. iv. 120-122, 129-133; v. 18, 32; (4) for Torone see\r\n    Thuc. ib., and also v. 3; (5) for the expulsion of the Aeginetans\r\n    in 431 B.C. see Thuc. ii. 27.\r\n\r\nLysander presently left the Hellespont with two hundred sail and arrived\r\nat Lesbos, where he established a new order of things in Mitylene and\r\nthe other cities of the island. Meanwhile he despatched Eteonicus with\r\na squadron of ten ships to the northern coasts, (2) where that officer\r\nbrought about a revolution of affairs which placed the whole region\r\nin the hands of Lacedaemon. Indeed, in a moment of time, after the\r\nsea-fight, the whole of Hellas had revolted from Athens, with the\r\nsolitary exception of the men of Samos. These, having massacred the\r\nnotables, (3) held the state under their control. After a while Lysander\r\nsent messages to Agis at Deceleia, and to Lacedaemon, announcing his\r\napproach with a squadron of two hundred sail.\r\n\r\n (2) Lit. \"the Thraceward districts.\" See above, p. 16.\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"since they had slain their notables, held the state under\r\n    popular control.\" See Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. viii. p. 303\r\n    note 3 (2d ed.), who thinks that the incident referred to is the\r\n    violent democratic revolution in Samos described in Thuc. viii.\r\n    21, B.C. 412.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to a general order of Pausanias, the other king of\r\nLacedaemon, a levy in force of the Lacedaemonians and all the rest of\r\nPeloponnesus, except the Argives, was set in motion for a campaign. As\r\nsoon as the several contingents had arrived, the king put himself at\r\ntheir head and marched against Athens, encamping in the gymnasium of the\r\nAcademy, (4) as it is called. Lysander had now reached Aegina, where,\r\nhaving got together as many of the former inhabitants as possible, he\r\nformally reinstated them in their city; and what he did in behalf of the\r\nAeginetans, he did also in behalf of the Melians, and of the rest who\r\nhad been deprived of their countries. He then pillaged the island of\r\nSalamis, and finally came to moorings off Piraeus with one hundred and\r\nfifty ships of the line, and established a strict blockade against all\r\nmerchant ships entering that harbour.\r\n\r\n (4) For this most illustrious of Athenian gymnasia, which still\r\n    retains its name, see Leake, \"Topography of Athens,\" i. 195 foll.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, finding themselves besieged by land and sea, were in\r\nsore perplexity what to do. Without ships, without allies, without\r\nprovisions, the belief gained hold upon them that there was no way of\r\nescape. They must now, in their turn, suffer what they had themselves\r\ninflincted upon others; not in retaliation, indeed, for ills received,\r\nbut out of sheer insolence, overriding the citizens of petty states, and\r\nfor no better reason than that these were allies of the very men now at\r\ntheir gates. In this frame of mind they enfranchised those who at any\r\ntime had lost their civil rights, and schooled themselves to endurance;\r\nand, albeit many succumbed to starvation, no thought of truce or\r\nreconciliation with their foes was breathed. (5) But when the stock\r\nof corn was absolutely insufficient, they sent an embassage to Agis,\r\nproposing to become allies of the Lacedaemonians on the sole condition\r\nof keeping their fortification walls and Piraeus; and to draw up\r\narticles of treaty on these terms. Agis bade them betake themselves to\r\nLacedaemon, seeing that he had no authority to act himself. With this\r\nanswer the ambassadors returned to Athens, and were forthwith sent on to\r\nLacedaemon. On reaching Sellasia, (6) a town in (7) Laconian territory,\r\nthey waited till they got their answer from the ephors, who, having\r\nlearnt their terms (which were identical to those already proposed\r\nto Agis), bade them instantly to be gone, and, if they really desired\r\npeace, to come with other proposals, the fruit of happier reflection.\r\nThus the ambassadors returned home, and reported the result of their\r\nembassage, whereupon despondency fell upon all. It was a painful\r\nreflection that in the end they would be sold into slavery; and\r\nmeanwhile, pending the return of a second embassy, many must needs fall\r\nvictims to starvation. The razing of their fortifications was not a\r\nsolution which any one cared to recommend. A senator, Archestratus, had\r\nindeed put the question in the senate, whether it were not best to make\r\npeace with the Lacedaemonians on such terms as they were willing to\r\npropose; but he was thrown into prison. The Laconian proposals referred\r\nto involved the destruction of both long walls for a space of more than\r\na mile. And a decree had been passed, making it illegal to submit any\r\nsuch proposition about the walls. Things having reached this pass,\r\nTheramenes made a proposal in the public assembly as follows: If they\r\nchose to send him as an ambassador to Lysander, he would go and find out\r\nwhy the Lacedaemonians were so unyielding about the walls; whether it\r\nwas they really intended to enslave the city, or merely that they wanted\r\na guarantee of good faith. Despatched accordingly, he lingered on with\r\nLysander for three whole months and more, watching for the time when the\r\nAthenians, at the last pinch of starvation, would be willing to accede\r\nto any terms that might be offered. At last, in the fourth month, he\r\nreturned and reported to the public assembly that Lysander had detained\r\nhim all this while, and had ended by bidding him betake himself to\r\nLacedaemon, since he had no authority himself to answer his questions,\r\nwhich must be addressed directly to the ephors. After this Theramenes\r\nwas chosen with nine others to go to Lacedaemon as ambassadors with\r\nfull powers. Meanwhile Lysander had sent an Athenian exile, named\r\nAristoteles, in company of certain Lacedaemonians, to Sparta to report\r\nto the board of ephors how he had answered Theramenes, that they, and\r\nthey alone, had supreme authority in matters of peace and war.\r\n\r\n (5) Or, \"they refused to treat for peace.\"\r\n\r\n (6) Sellasia, the bulwark of Sparta in the valley of the Oenus.\r\n\r\n (7) The MSS. have \"in the neighbourhood of,\" which words are\r\n    inappropriate at this date, though they may well have been added\r\n    by some annotator after the Cleomenic war and the battle of\r\n    Sellasia, B.C. 222, when Antigonus of Macedon destroyed the place\r\n    in the interests of the Achaean League.\r\n\r\nTheramenes and his companions presently reached Sellasia, and being\r\nthere questioned as to the reason of their visit, replied that they had\r\nfull powers to treat of peace. After which the ephors ordered them to\r\nbe summoned to their presence. On their arrival a general assembly was\r\nconvened, in which the Corinthians and Thebans more particularly, though\r\ntheir views were shared by many other Hellenes also, urged the meeting\r\nnot to come to terms with the Athenians, but to destroy them. The\r\nLacedaemonians replied that they would never reduce to slavery a city\r\nwhich was itself an integral portion of Hellas, and had performed a\r\ngreat and noble service to Hellas in the most perilous of emergencies.\r\nOn the contrary, they were willing to offer peace on the terms now\r\nspecified--namely, \"That the long walls and the fortifications of\r\nPiraeus should be destroyed; that the Athenian fleet, with the exception\r\nof twelve vessels, should be surrendered; that the exiles should be\r\nrestored; and lastly, that the Athenians should acknowledge the headship\r\nof Sparta in peace and war, leaving to her the choice of friends and\r\nfoes, and following her lead by land and sea.\" Such were the terms which\r\nTheramenes and the rest who acted with him were able to report on their\r\nreturn to Athens. As they entered the city, a vast crowd met them,\r\ntrembling lest their mission have proved fruitless. For indeed delay\r\nwas no longer possible, so long already was the list of victims daily\r\nperishing from starvation. On the day following, the ambassadors\r\ndelivered their report, stating the terms upon which the Lacedaemonians\r\nwere willing to make peace. Theramenes acted as spokesman, insisting\r\nthat they ought to obey the Lacedaemonians and pull down the walls. A\r\nsmall minority raised their voice in opposition, but the majority were\r\nstrongly in favour of the proposition, and the resolution was passed to\r\naccept the peace. After that, Lysander sailed into the Piraeus, and the\r\nexiles were readmitted. And so they fell to levelling the fortifications\r\nand walls with much enthusiasm, to the accompaniment of female\r\nflute-players, deeming that day the beginning of liberty to Greece.\r\n\r\nThus the year drew to its close (8)--during its middle months took place\r\nthe accession of Dionysius, the son of Hermocrates the Syracusan, to\r\nthe tyranny of Syracuse; an incident itself preceded by a victory gained\r\nover the Carthaginians by the Syracusans; the reduction of Agrigentum\r\nthrough famine by the Carthaginians themselves; and the exodus of the\r\nSicilian Greeks from that city.\r\n\r\n (8) For the puzzling chronology of this paragraph see Grote, \"Hist. of\r\n    Greece,\" vol. x. p 619 (2d ed.) If genuine, the words may perhaps\r\n    have slipt out of their natural place in chapter i. above, in\r\n    front of the words \"in the following year Lysander arrived,\" etc.\r\n    L. Dindorf brackets them as spurious. Xen., \"Hist. Gr.\" ed.\r\n    tertia, Lipsiae, MDCCCLXXII. For the incidents referred to see\r\n    above; Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. x. pp. 582, 598 (2d ed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nB.C. 404. In the following year (1) the people passed a resolution\r\nto choose thirty men who were to draft a constitution based on the\r\nancestral laws of the State. The following were chosen to act on this\r\ncommittee:--Polychares, Critias, Melobius, Hippolochus, Eucleides,\r\nHiero, Mnesilochus, Chremo, Theramenes, Aresias, Diocles, Phaedrias,\r\nChaereleos, Anaetius, Piso, Sophocles, Erastosthenes, Charicles,\r\nOnomacles, Theognis, Aeschines, Theogones, Cleomedes, Erasistratus,\r\nPheido, Dracontides, Eumathes, Aristoteles, Hippomachus, Mnesitheides.\r\nAfter these transactions, Lysander set sail for Samos; and Agis withdrew\r\nthe land force from Deceleia and disbanded the troops, dismissing the\r\ncontingents to their several cities.\r\n\r\n (1) The MSS. here add \"it was that year of the Olympiad cycle in which\r\n    Crocinas, a Thessalian, won the Stadium; when Endius was ephor at\r\n    Sparta, and Pythodorus archon at Athens, though the Athenians\r\n    indeed do not call the year by that archon's name, since he was\r\n    elected during the oligarchy, but prefer to speak of the year of\r\n    'anarchy'; the aforesaid oligarchy originated thus,\"--which,\r\n    though correct, probably was not written by Xenophon. The year of\r\n    anarchy might perhaps be better rendered \"the year without\r\n    archons.\"\r\n\r\nIn was at this date, about the time of the solar eclipse, (2) that\r\nLycophron of Pherae, who was ambitious of ruling over the whole of\r\nThessaly, defeated those sections of the Thessalians who opposed him,\r\nsuch as the men of Larissa and others, and slew many of them. It\r\nwas also about this date that Dionysius, now tyrant of Syracuse, was\r\ndefeated by the Carthaginians and lost Gela and Camarina. And again, a\r\nlittle later, the men of Leontini, who previously had been amalgamated\r\nwith the Syracusans, separated themselves from Syracuse and Dionysius,\r\nand asserted their independence, and returned to their native city.\r\nAnother incident of this period was the sudden despatch and introduction\r\nof Syracusan horse into Catana by Dionysius.\r\n\r\n (2) This took place on 2d September B.C. 404.\r\n\r\nNow the Samians, though besieged by Lysander on all sides, were at first\r\nunwilling to come to terms. But at the last moment, when Lysander was on\r\nthe point of assaulting the town, they accepted the terms, which allowed\r\nevery free man to leave the island, but not to carry away any part of\r\nhis property, except the clothes on his back. On these conditions they\r\nmarched out. The city and all it contained was then delivered over to\r\nits ancient citizens by Lysander, who finally appointed ten governors\r\nto garrison the island. (3) After which, he disbanded the allied fleet,\r\ndismissing them to their respective cities, while he himself, with the\r\nLacedaemonian squadron, set sail for Laconia, bringing with him the\r\nprows of the conquered vessels and the whole navy of Piraeus, with\r\nthe exception of twelve ships. He also brought the crowns which he had\r\nreceived from the cities as private gifts, and a sum of four hundred and\r\nseventy talents (4) in silver (the surplus of the tribute money which\r\nCyrus had assigned to him for the prosecution of the war), besides other\r\nproperty, the fruit of his military exploits. All these things Lysander\r\ndelivered to the Lacedaemonians in the latter end of summer. (5)\r\n\r\n (3) A council of ten, or \"decarchy.\" See Grote, \"H. G.\" viii. 323 (1st\r\n    ed.)\r\n\r\n (4) About 112,800 pounds.\r\n\r\n (5) The MSS. add \"a summer, the close of which coincided with the\r\n    termination of a war which had lasted twenty-eight and a half\r\n    years, as the list of annual ephors, appended in order, serves to\r\n    show. Aenesias is the first name. The war began during his\r\n    ephorate, in the fifteenth year of the thirty years' truce after\r\n    the capture of Euboea. His successors were Brasidas, Isanor,\r\n    Sostratidas, Exarchus, Agesistratus, Angenidas, Onomacles,\r\n    Zeuxippus, Pityas, Pleistolas, Cleinomachus, Harchus, Leon,\r\n    Chaerilas, Patesiadas, Cleosthenes, Lycarius, Eperatus,\r\n    Onomantius, Alexippidas, Misgolaidas, Isias, Aracus, Euarchippus,\r\n    Pantacles, Pityas, Archytas, and lastly, Endius, during whose year\r\n    of office Lysander sailed home in triumph, after performing the\r\n    exploits above recorded,\"--the interpolation, probably, of some\r\n    editor or copyist, the words \"twenty-eight and a half\" being\r\n    probably a mistake on his part for \"twenty-seven and a half.\" Cf.\r\n    Thuc. v. 26; also Buchsenschutz, Einleitung, p. 8 of his school\r\n    edition of the \"Hellenica.\"\r\n\r\nThe Thirty had been chosen almost immediately after the long walls and\r\nthe fortifications round Piraeus had been razed. They were chosen\r\nfor the express purpose of compiling a code of laws for the future\r\nconstitution of the State. The laws were always on the point of being\r\npublished, yet they were never forthcoming; and the thirty compilers\r\ncontented themselves meanwhile with appointing a senate and the other\r\nmagistracies as suited their fancy best. That done, they turned their\r\nattention, in the first instance, to such persons as were well known to\r\nhave made their living as informers (6) under the democracy, and to be\r\nthorns in the side of all respectable people. These they laid hold on\r\nand prosecuted on the capital charge. The new senate gladly recorded its\r\nvote of condemnation against them; and the rest of the world, conscious\r\nof bearing no resemblance to them, seemed scarcely vexed. But the Thirty\r\ndid not stop there. Presently they began to deliberate by what means\r\nthey could get the city under their absolute control, in order that they\r\nmight work their will upon it. Here again they proceeded tentatively;\r\nin the first instance, they sent (two of their number), Aeschines and\r\nAristoteles, to Lacedaemon, and persuaded Lysander to support them in\r\ngetting a Lacedaemonian garrison despatched to Athens. They only\r\nneeded it until they had got the \"malignants\" out of the way, and had\r\nestablished the constitution; and they would undertake to maintain these\r\ntroops at their own cost. Lysander was not deaf to their persuasions,\r\nand by his co-operation their request was granted. A bodyguard, with\r\nCallibius as governor, was sent.\r\n\r\n (6) Lit. \"by sycophancy,\" i.e. calumnious accusation--the sycophant's\r\n    trade. For a description of this pest of Athenian life cf. \"Dem.\"\r\n    in Arist. 1, S. 52; quoted in Jebb, \"Attic Orators,\" chap. xxix.\r\n    14; cf. Aristoph. \"Ach.\" 904; Xen. \"Mem.\" II. ix. 1.\r\n\r\nAnd now that they had got the garrison, they fell to flattering\r\nCallibius with all servile flattery, in order that he might give\r\ncountenance to their doings. Thus they prevailed on him to allow some of\r\nthe guards, whom they selected, to accompany them, while they proceeded\r\nto lay hands on whom they would; no longer confining themselves to base\r\nfolk and people of no account, but boldly laying hands on those who they\r\nfelt sure would least easily brook being thrust aside, or, if a\r\nspirit of opposition seized them, could command the largest number of\r\npartisans.\r\n\r\nThese were early days; as yet Critias was of one mind with Theramenes,\r\nand the two were friends. But the time came when, in proportion as\r\nCritias was ready to rush headlong into wholesale carnage, like one\r\nwho thirsted for the blood of the democracy, which had banished him,\r\nTheramenes balked and thwarted him. It was barely reasonable, he argued,\r\nto put people to death, who had never done a thing wrong to respectable\r\npeople in their lives, simply because they had enjoyed influence and\r\nhonour under the democracy. \"Why, you and I, Critias,\" he would add,\r\n\"have said and done many things ere now for the sake of popularity.\"\r\nTo which the other (for the terms of friendly intimacy still subsisted)\r\nwould retort, \"There is no choice left to us, since we intend to take\r\nthe lion's share, but to get rid of those who are best able to hinder\r\nus. If you imagine, because we are thirty instead of one, our government\r\nrequires one whit the less careful guarding than an actual tyranny, you\r\nmust be very innocent.\"\r\n\r\nSo things went on. Day after day the list of persons put to death for no\r\njust reason grew longer. Day after day the signs of resentment were more\r\nsignificant in the groups of citizens banding together and forecasting\r\nthe character of this future constitution; till at length Theramenes\r\nspoke again, protesting:--There was no help for it but to associate with\r\nthemselves a sufficient number of persons in the conduct of affairs, or\r\nthe oligarchy would certainly come to an end. Critias and the rest\r\nof the Thirty, whose fears had already converted Theramenes into a\r\ndangerous popular idol, proceeded at once to draw up a list of three\r\nthousand citizens; fit and proper persons to have a share in the conduct\r\nof affairs. But Theramenes was not wholly satisfied, \"indeed he must\r\nsay, for himself, he regarded it as ridiculous, that in their effort to\r\nassociate the better classes with themselves in power, they should fix\r\non just that particular number, three thousand, as if that figure had\r\nsome necessary connection with the exact number of gentlemen in the\r\nState, making it impossible to discover any respectability outside\r\nor rascality within the magic number. And in the second place,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"I see we are trying to do two things, diametrically opposed;\r\nwe are manufacturing a government, which is based on force, and at the\r\nsame time inferior in strength to those whom we propose to govern.\"\r\nThat was what he said, but what his colleagues did, was to institute a\r\nmilitary inspection or review. The Three Thousand were drawn up in the\r\nAgora, and the rest of the citizens, who were not included in the list,\r\nelsewhere in various quarters of the city. The order to take arms was\r\ngiven; (7) but while the men's backs were turned, at the bidding of the\r\nThirty, the Laconian guards, with those of the citizens who shared their\r\nviews, appeared on the scene and took away the arms of all except the\r\nThree Thousand, carried them up to the Acropolis, and safely deposited\r\nthem in the temple.\r\n\r\n (7) Or, \"a summons to the 'place d'armes' was given; but.\" Or, \"the\r\n    order to seize the arms was given, and.\" It is clear from\r\n    Aristoph. \"Acharn.\" 1050, that the citizens kept their weapons at\r\n    home. On the other hand, it was a custom not to come to any\r\n    meeting in arms. See Thuc. vi. 58. It seems probable that while\r\n    the men were being reviewed in the market-place and elsewhere, the\r\n    ruling party gave orders to seize their weapons (which they had\r\n    left at home), and this was done except in the case of the Three\r\n    Thousand. Cf. Arnold, \"Thuc.\" II. 2. 5; and IV. 91.\r\n\r\nThe ground being thus cleared, as it were, and feeling that they had\r\nit in their power to do what they pleased, they embarked on a course of\r\nwholesale butchery, to which many were sacrificed to the merest hatred,\r\nmany to the accident of possessing riches. Presently the question\r\nrose, How they were to get money to pay their guards? and to meet this\r\ndifficulty a resolution was passed empowering each of the committee to\r\nseize on one of the resident aliens apiece, to put his victim to death,\r\nand to confiscate his property. Theramenes was invited, or rather told\r\nto seize some one or other. \"Choose whom you will, only let it be done.\"\r\nTo which he made answer, it hardly seemed to him a noble or worthy\r\ncourse on the part of those who claimed to be the elite of society to go\r\nbeyond the informers (8) in injustice. \"Yesterday they, to-day we; with\r\nthis difference, the victim of the informer must live as a source of\r\nincome; our innocents must die that we may get their wealth. Surely\r\ntheir method was innocent in comparison with ours.\"\r\n\r\n (8) See above.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Thirty, who had come to regard Theramenes as an obstacle\r\nto any course they might wish to adopt, proceeded to plot against him.\r\nThey addressed themselves to the members of the senate in private,\r\nhere a man and there a man, and denounced him as the marplot of the\r\nconstitution. Then they issued an order to the young men, picking out\r\nthe most audacious characters they could find, to be present, each with\r\na dagger hidden in the hollow of the armpit; and so called a meeting\r\nof the senate. When Theramenes had taken his place, Critias got up and\r\naddressed the meeting:\r\n\r\n\"If,\" said he, \"any member of this council, here seated, imagines that\r\nan undue amount of blood has been shed, let me remind him that with\r\nchanges of constitution such things can not be avoided. It is the rule\r\neverywhere, but more particularly at Athens it was inevitable there\r\nshould be found a specially large number of persons sworn foes to any\r\nconstitutional change in the direction of oligarchy, and this for two\r\nreasons. First, because the population of this city, compared with other\r\nHellenic cities, is enormously large; and again, owing to the length of\r\ntime during which the people has battened upon liberty. Now, as to two\r\npoints we are clear. The first is that democracy is a form of government\r\ndetestable to persons like ourselves--to us and to you; the next is that\r\nthe people of Athens could never be got to be friendly to our friends\r\nand saviours, the Lacedaemonians. But on the loyalty of the better\r\nclasses the Lacedaemonians can count. And that is our reason for\r\nestablishing an oligarchical constitution with their concurrence. That\r\nis why we do our best to rid us of every one whom we perceive to be\r\nopposed to the oligarchy; and, in our opinion, if one of ourselves\r\nshould elect to undermine this constitution of ours, he would deserve\r\npunishment. Do you not agree? And the case,\" he continued, \"is no\r\nimaginary one. The offender is here present--Theramenes. And what we say\r\nof him is, that he is bent upon destroying yourselves and us by every\r\nmeans in his power. These are not baseless charges; but if you will\r\nconsider it, you will find them amply established in this unmeasured\r\ncensure of the present posture of affairs, and his persistent opposition\r\nto us, his colleagues, if ever we seek to get rid of any of these\r\ndemagogues. Had this been his guiding principle of action from the\r\nbeginning, in spite of hostility, at least he would have escaped all\r\nimputation of villainy. Why, this is the very man who originated our\r\nfriendly and confidential relations with Lacedaemon. This is the very\r\nman who authorised the abolition of the democracy, who urged us on to\r\ninflict punishment on the earliest batch of prisoners brought before\r\nus. But to-day all is changed; now you and we are out of odour with\r\nthe people, and he accordingly has ceased to be pleased with our\r\nproceedings. The explanation is obvious. In case of a catastrophe, how\r\nmuch pleasanter for him once again to light upon his legs, and leave us\r\nto render account for our past performances.\r\n\r\n\"I contend that this man is fairly entitled to render his account also,\r\nnot only as an ordinary enemy, but as a traitor to yourselves and us.\r\nAnd let us add, not only is treason more formidable than open war, in\r\nproportion as it is harder to guard against a hidden assassin than\r\nan open foe, but it bears the impress of a more enduring hostility,\r\ninasmuch as men fight their enemies and come to terms with them again\r\nand are fast friends; but whoever heard of reconciliation with a\r\ntraitor? There he stands unmasked; he has forfeited our confidence for\r\nevermore. But to show you that these are no new tactics of his, to prove\r\nto you that he is a traitor in grain, I will recall to your memories\r\nsome points in his past history.\r\n\r\n\"He began by being held in high honour by the democracy; but taking a\r\nleaf out of his father's, Hagnon's, book, he next showed a most headlong\r\nanxiety to transform the democracy into the Four Hundred, and, in fact,\r\nfor a time held the first place in that body. But presently, detecting\r\nthe formation of rival power to the oligarchs, round he shifted; and we\r\nfind him next a ringleader of the popular party in assailing them. It\r\nmust be admitted, he has well earned his nickname 'Buskin.' (9) Yes,\r\nTheramenes! clever you may be, but the man who deserves to live should\r\nnot show his cleverness in leading on his associates into trouble, and\r\nwhen some obstacle presents itself, at once veer round; but like a pilot\r\non shipboard, he ought then to redouble his efforts, until the wind is\r\nfair. Else, how in the name of wonderment are those mariners to reach\r\nthe haven where they would be, if at the first contrary wind or\r\ntide they turn about and sail in the opposite direction? Death and\r\ndestruction are concomitants of constitutional changes and revolution,\r\nno doubt; but you are such an impersonation of change, that, as you\r\ntwist and turn and double, you deal destruction on all sides. At one\r\nswoop you are the ruin of a thousand oligarchs at the hands of the\r\npeople, and at another of a thousand democrats at the hands of the\r\nbetter classes. Why, sirs, this is the man to whom the orders were given\r\nby the generals, in the sea-fight off Lesbos, to pick up the crews of\r\nthe disabled vessels; and who, neglecting to obey orders, turned round\r\nand accused the generals; and to save himself murdered them! What, I ask\r\nyou, of a man who so openly studied the art of self-seeking, deaf\r\nalike to the pleas of honour and to the claims of friendship? Would not\r\nleniency towards such a creature be misplaced? Can it be our duty at\r\nall to spare him? Ought we not rather, when we know the doublings of his\r\nnature, to guard against them, lest we enable him presently to practise\r\non ourselves? The case is clear. We therefore hereby cite this man\r\nbefore you, as a conspirator and traitor against yourselves and us. The\r\nreasonableness of our conduct, one further reflection may make clear.\r\nNo one, I take it, will dispute the splendour, the perfection of the\r\nLaconian constitution. Imagine one of the ephors there in Sparta, in\r\nlieu of devoted obedience to the majority, taking on himself to find\r\nfault with the government and to oppose all measures. Do you not think\r\nthat the ephors themselves, and the whole commonwealth besides, would\r\nhold this renegade worthy of condign punishment? So, too, by the same\r\ntoken, if you are wise, do you spare yourselves, not him. For what does\r\nthe alternative mean? I will tell you. His preservation will cause\r\nthe courage of many who hold opposite views to your own to rise; his\r\ndestruction will cut off the last hopes of all your enemies, whether\r\nwithin or without the city.\"\r\n\r\n (9) An annotator seems to have added here the words, occurring in the\r\n    MSS., \"the buskin which seems to fit both legs equally, but is\r\n    constant to neither,\" unless, indeed, they are an original\r\n    \"marginal note\" of the author. For the character of Theramenes, as\r\n    popularly conceived, cf. Aristoph. \"Frogs,\" 538, 968 foll., and\r\n    Thuc. viii. 92; and Prof. Jowett, \"Thuc.\" vol. ii. pp. 523, 524.\r\n\r\nWith these words he sat down, but Theramenes rose and said: \"Sirs, with\r\nyour permission I will first touch upon the charge against me which\r\nCritias has mentioned last. The assertion is that as the accuser of the\r\ngenerals I was their murderer. Now I presume it was not I who began\r\nthe attack upon them, but it was they who asserted that in spite of\r\nthe orders given me I had neglected to pick up the unfortunates in the\r\nsea-fight off Lesbos. All I did was to defend myself. My defence was\r\nthat the storm was too violent to permit any vessel to ride at sea, much\r\nmore therefore to pick up the men, and this defence was accepted by my\r\nfellow-citizens as highly reasonable, while the generals seemed to be\r\ncondemned out of their own mouths. For while they kept on asserting\r\nthat it was possible to save the men, the fact still remained that they\r\nabandoned them to their fate, set sail, and were gone.\r\n\r\n\"However, I am not surprised, I confess, at this grave misconception\r\n(10) on the part of Critias, for at the date of these occurrences he\r\nwas not in Athens. He was away in Thessaly, laying the foundations of\r\na democracy with Prometheus, and arming the Penestae (11) against their\r\nmasters. Heaven forbid that any of his transactions there should be\r\nre-enacted here. However, I must say, I do heartily concur with him on\r\none point. Whoever desires to exclude you from the government, or to\r\nstrength the hands of your secret foes, deserves and ought to meet with\r\ncondign punishment; but who is most capable of so doing? That you will\r\nbest discover, I think, by looking a little more closely into the past\r\nand the present conduct of each of us. Well, then! up to the moment at\r\nwhich you were formed into a senatorial body, when the magistracies were\r\nappointed, and certain notorious 'informers' were brought to trial, we\r\nall held the same views. But later on, when our friends yonder began\r\nto hale respectable honest folk to prison and to death, I, on my side,\r\nbegan to differ from them. From the moment when Leon of Salamis, (12)\r\na man of high and well-deserved reputation, was put to death, though he\r\nhad not committed the shadow of a crime, I knew that all his equals must\r\ntremble for themselves, and, so trembling, be driven into opposition to\r\nthe new constitution. In the same way, when Niceratus, (13) the son of\r\nNicias, was arrested; a wealthy man, who, no more than his father, had\r\nnever done anything that could be called popular or democratic in his\r\nlife; it did not require much insight to discover that his compeers\r\nwould be converted into our foes. But to go a step further: when it\r\ncame to Antiphon (14) falling at our hands--Antiphon, who during the war\r\ncontributed two fast-sailing men-of-war out of his own resources, it was\r\nthen plain to me, that all who had ever been zealous and patriotic\r\nmust eye us with suspicion. Once more I could not help speaking out in\r\nopposition to my colleagues when they suggested that each of us ought to\r\nseize some one resident alien. (15) For what could be more certain\r\nthan that their death-warrant would turn the whole resident foreign\r\npopulation into enemies of the constitution. I spoke out again when they\r\ninsisted on depriving the populace of their arms; it being no part of my\r\ncreed that we ought to take the strength out of the city; nor, indeed,\r\nso far as I could see, had the Lacedaemonians stept between us and\r\ndestruction merely that we might become a handful of people, powerless\r\nto aid them in the day of need. Had that been their object, they might\r\nhave swept us away to the last man. A few more weeks, or even days,\r\nwould have sufficed to extinguish us quietly by famine. Nor, again, can\r\nI say that the importation of mercenary foreign guards was altogether to\r\nmy taste, when it would have been so easy for us to add to our own\r\nbody a sufficient number of fellow-citizens to ensure our supremacy as\r\ngovernors over those we essayed to govern. But when I saw what an army\r\nof malcontents this government had raised up within the city walls,\r\nbesides another daily increasing host of exiles without, I could not\r\nbut regard the banishment of people like Thrasybulus and Anytus and\r\nAlcibiades (16) as impolitic. Had our object been to strengthen the\r\nrival power, we could hardly have set about it better than by providing\r\nthe populace with the competent leaders whom they needed, and the\r\nwould-be leaders themselves with an army of willing adherents.\r\n\r\n (10) Reading with Cobet {paranenomikenai}.\r\n\r\n (11) I.e. serfs--Penestae being the local name in Thessaly for the\r\n    villein class. Like the {Eilotes} in Laconia, they were originally\r\n    a conquered tribe, afterwards increased by prisoners of war, and\r\n    formed a link between the freemen and born slaves.\r\n\r\n (12) Cf. \"Mem.\" IV. iv. 3; Plat. \"Apol.\" 8. 32.\r\n\r\n (13) Cf.

According to Lysias, Theramenes, when a member of the\r\n    first Oligarchy, betrayed his own closest friends, Antiphon and\r\n    Archeptolemus. See Prof. Jebb, \"Attic Orators,\" I. x. p. 266.\r\n\r\n (15) The resident aliens, or {metoikoi}, \"metics,\" so technically\r\n    called.\r\n\r\n (16) Isocr. \"De Bigis,\" 355; and Prof. Jebb's \"Attic Orators,\" ii.\r\n    230. In the defence of his father's career, which the younger\r\n    Alcibiades, the defendant in this case (B.C. 397 probably) has\r\n    occasion to make, he reminds the court, that under the Thirty,\r\n    others were banished from Athens, but his father was driven out of\r\n    the civilised world of Hellas itself, and finally murdered. See\r\n    Plutarch, \"Alcibiades,\" ad fin.\r\n\r\n\"I ask then is the man who tenders such advice in the full light of\r\nday justly to be regarded as a traitor, and not as a benefactor? Surely\r\nCritias, the peacemaker, the man who hinders the creation of many\r\nenemies, whose counsels tend to the acquistion of yet more friends, (17)\r\ncannot be accused of strengthening the hands of the enemy. Much more\r\ntruly may the imputation be retorted on those who wrongfully appropriate\r\ntheir neighbours' goods and put to death those who have done no wrong.\r\nThese are they who cause our adversaries to grow and multiply, and\r\nwho in very truth are traitors, not to their friends only, but to\r\nthemselves, spurred on by sordid love of gain.\r\n\r\n (17) Or, \"the peacemaker, the healer of differences, the cementer of\r\n    new alliances, cannot,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\"I might prove the truth of what I say in many ways, but I beg you to\r\nlook at the matter thus. With which condition of affairs here in Athens\r\ndo you think will Thrasybulus and Anytus and the other exiles be the\r\nbetter pleased? That which I have pictured as desirable, or that which\r\nmy colleagues yonder are producing? For my part I cannot doubt but that,\r\nas things now are, they are saying to themselves, 'Our allies muster\r\nthick and fast.' But were the real strength, the pith and fibre of this\r\ncity, kindly disposed to us, they would find it an uphill task even to\r\nget a foothold anywhere in the country.\r\n\r\n\"Then, with regard to what he said of me and my propensity to be for\r\never changing sides, let me draw your attention to the following facts.\r\nWas it not the people itself, the democracy, who voted the constitution\r\nof the Four Hundred? This they did, because they had learned to think\r\nthat the Lacedaemonians would trust any other form of government rather\r\nthan a democracy. But when the efforts of Lacedaemon were not a whit\r\nrelaxed, when Aristoteles, Melanthius, and Aristarchus, (18) and the\r\nrest of them acting as generals, were plainly minded to construct an\r\nintrenched fortress on the mole for the purpose of admitting the\r\nenemy, and so getting the city under the power of themselves and their\r\nassociates; (19) because I got wind of these schemes, and nipped them in\r\nthe bud, is that to be a traitor to one's friends?\r\n\r\n (18) Cf. Thuc. viii. 90-92, for the behaviour of the Lacedaemonian\r\n    party at Athens and the fortification of Eetioneia in B.C. 411.\r\n\r\n (19) I.e. of the political clubs.\r\n\r\n\"Then he threw in my teeth the nickname 'Buskin,' as descriptive of\r\nan endeavour on my part to fit both parties. But what of the man\r\nwho pleases neither? What in heaven's name are we to call him? Yes!\r\nyou--Critias? Under the democracy you were looked upon as the most\r\narrant hater of the people, and under the aristocracy you have proved\r\nyourself the bitterest foe of everything respectable. Yes! Critias, I\r\nam, and ever have been, a foe of those who think that a democracy cannot\r\nreach perfection until slaves and those who, from poverty, would sell\r\nthe city for a drachma, can get their drachma a day. (20) But not less\r\nam I, and ever have been, a pronounced opponent of those who do not\r\nthink there can possibly exist a perfect oligarchy until the State is\r\nsubjected to the despotism of a few. On the contrary, my own ambition\r\nhas been to combine with those who are rich enough to possess a horse\r\nand shield, and to use them for the benefit of the State. (21) That was\r\nmy ideal in the old days, and I hold to it without a shadow of turning\r\nstill. If you can imagine when and where, in conjunction with despots or\r\ndemagogues, I have set to my hand to deprive honest gentlefolk of\r\ntheir citizenship, pray speak. If you can convict me of such crimes at\r\npresent, or can prove my perpetration of them in the past, I admit that\r\nI deserve to die, and by the worst of deaths.\"\r\n\r\n (20) I.e. may enjoy the senatorial stipend of a drachma a day = 9 3/4\r\n    pence.\r\n\r\n (21) See Thuc. viii. 97, for a momentary realisation of that \"duly\r\n    attempered compound of Oligarchy and Democracy\" which Thucydides\r\n    praises, and which Theramenes here refers to. It threw the power\r\n    into the hands of the wealthier upper classes to the exclusion of\r\n    the {nautikos okhlos}. See Prof. Jowett, vol. ii. note, ad loc.\r\n    cit.\r\n\r\nWith these words he ceased, and the loud murmur of the applause which\r\nfollowed marked the favourable impression produced upon the senate.\r\nIt was plain to Critias, that if he allowed his adversary's fate to be\r\ndecided by formal voting, Theramenes would escape, and life to himself\r\nwould become intolerable. Accordingly he stepped forward and spoke a\r\nword or two in the ears of the Thirty. This done, he went out and gave\r\nan order to the attendants with the daggers to stand close to the bar\r\nin full view of the senators. Again he entered and addressed the senate\r\nthus: \"I hold it to be the duty of a good president, when he sees the\r\nfriends about him being made the dupes of some delusion, to intervene.\r\nThat at any rate is what I propose to do. Indeed our friends here\r\nstanding by the bar say that if we propose to acquit a man so openly\r\nbent upon the ruin of the oligarchy, they do not mean to let us do\r\nso. Now there is a clause in the new code forbidding any of the Three\r\nThousand to be put to death without your vote; but the Thirty have\r\npower of life and death over all outside that list. Accordingly,\" he\r\nproceeded, \"I herewith strike this man, Theramenes, off the list; and\r\nthis with the concurrence of my colleagues. And now,\" he continued, \"we\r\ncondemn him to death.\"\r\n\r\nHearing these words Theramenes sprang upon the altar of Hestia,\r\nexclaiming: \"And I, sirs, supplicate you for the barest forms of law and\r\njustice. Let it not be in the power of Critias to strike off either\r\nme, or any one of you whom he will. But in my case, in what may be your\r\ncase, if we are tried, let our trial be in accordance with the law they\r\nhave made concerning those on the list. I know,\" he added, \"but too\r\nwell, that this altar will not protect me; but I will make it plain that\r\nthese men are as impious towards the gods as they are nefarious towards\r\nmen. Yet I do marvel, good sirs and honest gentlemen, for so you are,\r\nthat you will not help yourselves, and that too when you must see that\r\nthe name of every one of you is as easily erased as mine.\"\r\n\r\nBut when he had got so far, the voice of the herald was heard giving the\r\norder to the Eleven to seize Theramenes. They at that instant entered\r\nwith their satellites--at their head Satyrus, the boldest and most\r\nshameless of the body--and Critias exclaimed, addressing the Eleven, \"We\r\ndeliver over to you Theramenes yonder, who has been condemned according\r\nto the law. Do you take him and lead him away to the proper place, and\r\ndo there with him what remains to do.\" As Critias uttered the words,\r\nSatyrus laid hold upon Theramenes to drag him from the altar, and the\r\nattendants lent their aid. But he, as was natural, called upon gods and\r\nmen to witness what was happening. The senators the while kept silence,\r\nseeing the companions of Satyrus at the bar, and the whole front of the\r\nsenate house crowded with the foreign guards, nor did they need to be\r\ntold that there were daggers in reserve among those present.\r\n\r\nAnd so Theramenes was dragged through the Agora, in vehement and loud\r\ntones proclaiming the wrongs that he was suffering. One word, which is\r\nsaid to have fallen from his lips, I cite. It is this: Satyrus, bade him\r\n\"Be silent, or he would rue the day;\" to which he made answer, \"And if I\r\nbe silent, shall I not rue it?\" Also, when they brought him the hemlock,\r\nand the time was come to drink the fatal draught, they tell how he\r\nplayfully jerked out the dregs from the bottom of the cup, like one who\r\nplays \"Cottabos,\" (22) with the words, \"This to the lovely Critias.\"\r\nThese are but \"apophthegms\" (23) too trivial, it may be thought, to find\r\na place in history. Yet I must deem it an admirable trait in this man's\r\ncharacter, if at such a moment, when death confronted him, neither his\r\nwits forsook him, nor could the childlike sportiveness vanish from his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n (22) \"A Sicilian game much in vogue at the drinking parties of young\r\n    men at Athens. The simplest mode was when each threw the wine left\r\n    in his cup so as to strike smartly in a metal basin, at the same\r\n    time invoking his mistress's name; if all fell into the basin and\r\n    the sound was clear, it was a sign he stood well with her.\"--\r\n    Liddell and Scott, sub. v. For the origin of the game compare\r\n    curiously enough the first line of the first Elegy of Critias\r\n    himself, who was a poet and political philosopher, as well as a\r\n    politician:--\r\n\r\n\"{Kottabos ek Sikeles esti khthonos, euprepes ergon on skopon es latagon\r\ntoxa kathistametha.}\" Bergk. \"Poetae Lyr. Graec.\" Pars II. xxx.\r\n\r\n\r\n (23) Or, \"these are sayings too slight, perhaps, to deserve record;\r\n    yet,\" etc. By an \"apophthegm\" was meant originally a terse\r\n    (sententious) remark, but the word has somewhat altered in\r\n    meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nSo Theramenes met his death; and, now that this obstacle was removed,\r\nthe Thirty, feeling that they had it in their power to play the tyrant\r\nwithout fear, issued an order forbidding all, whose names were not\r\non the list, to set foot within the city. Retirement in the country\r\ndistricts was no protection, thither the prosecutor followed them, and\r\nthence dragged them, that their farms and properties might fall to the\r\npossession of the Thirty and their friends. Even Piraeus was not safe;\r\nof those who sought refuge there, many were driven forth in similar\r\nfashion, until Megara and Thebes overflowed with the crowd of refugees.\r\n\r\nPresently Thrasybulus, with about seventy followers, sallied out from\r\nThebes, and made himself master of the fortress of Phyle. (1) The\r\nweather was brilliant, and the Thirty marched out of the city to repel\r\nthe invader; with them were the Three Thousand and the Knights. When\r\nthey reached the place, some of the young men, in the foolhardiness of\r\nyouth, made a dash at the fortress, but without effect; all they got was\r\nwounds, and so retired. The intention of the Thirty now was to blockade\r\nthe place; by shutting off all the avenues of supplies, they thought to\r\nforce the garrison to capitulate. But this project was interrupted by\r\na steady downfall of snow that night and the following day. Baffled\r\nby this all-pervading enemy they beat a retreat to the city, but not\r\nwithout the sacrifice of many of their camp-followers, who fell a prey\r\nto the men in Phyle. The next anxiety of the government in Athens was to\r\nsecure the farms and country houses against the plunderings and forays\r\nto which they would be exposed, if there were no armed force to\r\nprotect them. With this object a protecting force was despatched to\r\nthe \"boundary estates,\" (2) about two miles south of Phyle. This corps\r\nconsisted of the Lacedaemonian guards, or nearly all of them, and two\r\ndivisions of horse. (3) They encamped in a wild and broken district, and\r\nthe round of their duties commenced.\r\n\r\n (1) \"A strong fortress (the remains of which still exist) commanding\r\n    the narrow pass across Mount Parnes, through which runs the direct\r\n    road from Thebes to Athens, past Acharnae. The precipitous rock on\r\n    which it stands can only be approached by a ridge on the eastern\r\n    side. The height commands a magnificent view of the whole Athenian\r\n    plain, of the city itself, of Mount Hymettus, and the Saronic\r\n    Gulf,\"--\"Dict. of Geog., The demi of the Diacria and Mount\r\n    Parnes.\"\r\n\r\n (2) Cf. Boeckh, \"P. E. A.\" p. 63, Eng. ed.\r\n\r\n (3) Lit. tribes, each of the ten tribes furnishing about one hundred\r\n    horse.\r\n\r\nBut by this time the small garrison above them had increased tenfold,\r\nuntil there were now something like seven hundred men collected in\r\nPhyle; and with these Thrasybulus one night descended. When he was not\r\nquite half a mile from the enemy's encampment he grounded arms, and a\r\ndeep silence was maintained until it drew towards day. In a little while\r\nthe men opposite, one by one, were getting to their legs or leaving the\r\ncamp for necessary purposes, while a suppressed din and murmur arose,\r\ncaused by the grooms currying and combing their horses. This was the\r\nmoment for Thrasybulus and his men to snatch up their arms and make a\r\ndash at the enemy's position. Some they felled on the spot; and routing\r\nthe whole body, pursued them six or seven furlongs, killing one\r\nhundred and twenty hoplites and more. Of the cavalry, Nicostratus, \"the\r\nbeautiful,\" as men called him, and two others besides were slain; they\r\nwere caught while still in their beds. Returning from the pursuit,\r\nthe victors set up a trophy, got together all the arms they had taken,\r\nbesides baggage, and retired again to Phyle. A reinforcement of horse\r\nsent from the city could not discover the vestige of a foe; but waited\r\non the scene of battle until the bodies of the slain had been picked up\r\nby their relatives, when they withdrew again to the city.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Thirty, who had begun to realise the insecurity of their\r\nposition, were anxious to appropriate Eleusis, so that an asylum might\r\nbe ready for them against the day of need. With this view an order was\r\nissued to the Knights; and Critias, with the rest of the Thirty, visited\r\nEleusis. There they held a review of the Eleusians in the presence of\r\nthe Knights; (4) and, on the pretext of wishing to discover how many\r\nthey were, and how large a garrison they would further require, they\r\nordered the townsfolk to enter their names. As each man did so he had to\r\nretire by a postern leading to the sea. But on the sea-beach this\r\nside there were lines of cavalry drawn up in waiting, and as each man\r\nappeared he was handcuffed by the satellites of the Thirty. When all\r\nhad so been seized and secured, they gave orders to Lysimachus, the\r\ncommander of the cavalry, to take them off to the city and deliver them\r\nover to the Eleven. Next day they summoned the heavy armed who were on\r\nthe list, and the rest of the Knights (5) to the Odeum, and Critias rose\r\nand addressed them. He said: \"Sirs, the constitution, the lines of which\r\nwe are laying down, is a work undertaken in your interests no less than\r\nours; it is incumbent on you therefore to participate in its dangers,\r\neven as you will partake of its honours. We expect you therefore, in\r\nreference to these Eleusians here, who have been seized and secured, to\r\nvote their condemnation, so that our hopes and fears may be identical.\"\r\nThen, pointing to a particular spot, he said peremptorily, \"You will\r\nplease deposit your votes there within sight of all.\" It must be\r\nunderstood that the Laconian guards were present at the time, and armed\r\nto the teeth, and filling one-half of the Odeum. As to the proceedings\r\nthemselves, they found acceptance with those members of the State,\r\nbesides the Thirty, who could be satisfied with a simple policy of\r\nself-aggrandisement.\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"in the cavalry quarters,\" cf. {en tois ikhthusin} = in the\r\n    fish market. Or, \"at the review of the horse.\"\r\n\r\n (5) For the various Odeums at Athens vide Prof. Jebb, \"Theophr.\"\r\n    xviii. 235, 236. The one here named was near the fountain\r\n    Callirhoe by the Ilissus.\r\n\r\nBut now Thrasybulus at the head of his followers, by this time about one\r\nthousand strong, descended from Phyle and reached Piraeus in the night.\r\nThe Thirty, on their side, informed of this new move, were not slow to\r\nrally to the rescue, with the Laconian guards, supported by their own\r\ncavalry and hoplites. And so they advanced, marching down along the\r\nbroad carriage road which leads into Piraeus. The men from Phyle seemed\r\nat first inclined to dispute their passage, but as the wide circuit\r\nof the walls needed a defence beyond the reach of their still scanty\r\nnumbers, they fell back in a compact body upon Munychia. (6) Then the\r\ntroops from the city poured into the Agora of Hippodmus. (7) Here they\r\nformed in line, stretching along and filling the street which leads to\r\nthe temple of Artemis and the Bendideum. (8) This line must have been\r\nat least fifty shields deep; and in this formation they at once began\r\nto march up. As to the men of Phyle, they too blocked the street at the\r\nopposite end, and facing the foe. They presented only a thin line, not\r\nmore than ten deep, though behind these, certainly, were ranged a body\r\nof targeteers and light-armed javelin men, who were again supported by\r\nan artillery of stone-throwers--a tolerably numerous division drawn from\r\nthe population of the port and district itself. While his antagonists\r\nwere still advancing, Thrasybulus gave the order to ground their heavy\r\nshields, and having done so himself, whilst retaining the rest of\r\nhis arms, he stood in the midst, and thus addressed them: \"Men and\r\nfellow-citizens, I wish to inform some, and to remind others of you,\r\nthat of the men you see advancing beneath us there, the right division\r\nare the very men we routed and pursued only five days ago; while on the\r\nextreme left there you see the Thirty. These are the men who have not\r\nspared to rob us of our city, though we did no wrong; who have hounded\r\nus from our homes; who have set the seal of proscription on our dearest\r\nfriends. But to-day the wheel of fortune has revolved; that has come\r\nabout which least of all they looked for, which most of all we prayed\r\nfor. Here we stand with our good swords in our hands, face to face\r\nwith our foes; and the gods themselves are with us, seeing that we were\r\narrested in the midst of our peaceful pursuits; at any moment, whilst\r\nwe supped, or slept, or marketed, sentence of banishment was passed upon\r\nus: we had done no wrong--nay, many of us were not even resident in the\r\ncountry. To-day, therefore, I repeat, the gods do visibly fight upon our\r\nside; the great gods, who raise a tempest even in the midst of calm for\r\nour benefit, and when we lay to our hand to fight, enable our little\r\ncompany to set up the trophy of victory over the multitude of our foes.\r\nOn this day they have brought us hither to a place where the steep\r\nascent must needs hinder our foes from reaching with lance or arrow\r\nfurther than our foremost ranks; but we with our volley of spears and\r\narrows and stones cannot fail to reach them with terrible effect. Had we\r\nbeen forced to meet them vanguard to vanguard, on an equal footing, who\r\ncould have been surprised? But as it is, all I say to you is, let fly\r\nyour missiles with a will in right brave style. No one can miss his mark\r\nwhen the road is full of them. To avoid our darts they must be for ever\r\nducking and skulking beneath their shields; but we will rain blows upon\r\nthem in their blindness; we will leap upon them and lay them low. But,\r\nO sirs! let me call upon you so to bear yourselves that each shall\r\nbe conscious to himself that victory was won by him and him alone.\r\nVictory--which, God willing, shall this day restore to us the land of\r\nour fathers, our homes, our freedom, and the rewards of civic life, our\r\nchildren, if children we have, our darlings, and our wives! Thrice happy\r\nthose among us who as conquerors shall look upon this gladdest of all\r\ndays. Nor less fortunate the man who falls to-day. Not all the wealth\r\nin the world shall purchase him a monument so glorious. At the right\r\ninstant I will strike the keynote of the paean; then, with an invocation\r\nto the God of battle, (9) and in return for the wanton insults they put\r\nupon us, let us with one accord wreak vengeance on yonder men.\"\r\n\r\n (6) The citadel quarter of Piraeus.\r\n\r\n (7) Named after the famous architect Hippodamus, who built the town.\r\n    It was situated near where the two long walls joined the wall of\r\n    Piraeus; a broad street led from it up to the citadel of Munychia.\r\n\r\n (8) I.e. the temple of Bendis (the Thracian Artemis). Cf. Plat. \"Rep.\"\r\n    327, 354; and Prof. Jowett, \"Plato,\" vol. iii. pp. 193, 226.\r\n\r\n (9) Lit. \"Enyalius,\" in Homer an epithet of Ares; at another date (cf.\r\n    Aristoph. \"Peace,\" 456) looked upon as a distinct divinity.\r\n\r\nHaving so spoken, he turned round, facing the foemen, and kept quiet,\r\nfor the order passed by the soothsayer enjoined on them, not to\r\ncharge before one of their side was slain or wounded. \"As soon as that\r\nhappens,\" said the seer, \"we will lead you onwards, and the victory\r\nshall be yours; but for myself, if I err not, death is waiting.\" And\r\nherein he spoke truly, for they had barely resumed their arms when he\r\nhimself as though he were driven by some fatal hand, leapt out in front\r\nof the ranks, and so springing into the midst of the foe, was slain,\r\nand lies now buried at the passage of the Cephisus. But the rest were\r\nvictorious, and pursued the routed enemy down to the level ground.\r\nThere fell in this engagement, out of the number of the Thirty, Critias\r\nhimself and Hippomachus, and with them Charmides, (10) the son of\r\nGlaucon, one of the ten archons in Piraeus, and of the rest about\r\nseventy men. The arms of the slain were taken; but, as fellow-citizens,\r\nthe conquerors forebore to despoil them of their coats. This being done,\r\nthey proceeded to give back the dead under cover of a truce, when the\r\nmen, on either side, in numbers stept forward and conversed with one\r\nanother. Then Cleocritus (he was the Herald of the Initiated, (11) a\r\ntruly \"sweet-voiced herald,\" if ever there was), caused a deep\r\nsilence to reign, and addressed their late combatants as follows:\r\n\"Fellow-citizens--Why do you drive us forth? why would you slay us?\r\nwhat evil have we wrought you at any time? or is it a crime that we\r\nhave shared with you in the most solemn rites and sacrifices, and in\r\nfestivals of the fairest: we have been companions in the chorus, the\r\nschool, the army. We have braved a thousand dangers with you by land and\r\nsea in behalf of our common safety, our common liberty. By the gods\r\nof our fathers, by the gods of our mothers, by the hallowed names of\r\nkinship, intermarriage, comradeship, those three bonds which knit the\r\nhearts of so many of us, bow in reverence before God and man, and\r\ncease to sin against the land of our fathers: cease to obey these most\r\nunhallowed Thirty, who for the sake of private gain have in eight months\r\nslain almost more men than the Peloponnesians together in ten years of\r\nwarfare. See, we have it in our power to live as citizens in peace; it\r\nis only these men, who lay upon us this most foul burthen, this hideous\r\nhorror of fratricidal war, loathed of God and man. Ah! be well assured,\r\nfor these men slain by our hands this day, ye are not the sole mourners.\r\nThere are among them some whose deaths have wrung from us also many a\r\nbitter tear.\"\r\n\r\n (10) He was cousin to Critias, and uncle by the mother's side to\r\n    Plato, who introduces him in the dialogue, which bears his name\r\n    (and treats of Temperance), as a very young man at the beginning\r\n    of the Peloponnesian War. We hear more of him also from Xenophon\r\n    himself in the \"Memorabilia,\" iii. 6. 7; and as one of the\r\n    interlocutors in the \"Symposium.\"\r\n\r\n (11) I.e. of the Eleusinian mysteries. He had not only a loud voice,\r\n    but a big body. Cf. Aristoph. \"Frogs,\" 1237.\r\n\r\nSo he spoke, but the officers and leaders of the defeated army who were\r\nleft, unwilling that their troops should listen to such topics at that\r\nmoment, led them back to the city. But the next day the Thirty, in deep\r\ndown-heartedness and desolation, sat in the council chamber. The Three\r\nThousand, wherever their several divisions were posted, were everywhere\r\na prey to discord. Those who were implicated in deeds of violence, and\r\nwhose fears could not sleep, protested hotly that to yield to the party\r\nin Piraeus were preposterous. Those on the other hand who had faith in\r\ntheir own innocence, argued in their own minds, and tried to convince\r\ntheir neighbours that they could well dispense with most of their\r\npresent evils. \"Why yield obedience to these Thirty?\" they asked, \"Why\r\nassign to them the privilege of destroying the State?\" In the end they\r\nvoted a resolution to depose the government, and to elect another. This\r\nwas a board of ten, elected one from each tribe.\r\n\r\nB.C. 403. As to the Thirty, they retired to Eleusis; but the Ten,\r\nassisted by the cavalry officers, had enough to do to keep watch over\r\nthe men in the city, whose anarchy and mutual distrust were rampant. The\r\nKnights did not return to quarters at night, but slept out in the Odeum,\r\nkeeping their horses and shields close beside them; indeed the distrust\r\nwas so great that from evening onwards they patrolled the walls on foot\r\nwith their shields, and at break of day mounted their horses, at every\r\nmoment fearing some sudden attack upon them by the men in Piraeus. These\r\nlatter were now so numerous, and of so mixed a company, that it was\r\ndifficult to find arms for all. Some had to be content with shields of\r\nwood, others of wicker-work, which they spent their time in coating with\r\nwhitening. Before ten days had elapsed guarantees were given, securing\r\nfull citizenship, with equality of taxation and tribute to all,\r\neven foreigners, who would take part in the fighting. Thus they were\r\npresently able to take the field, with large detachments both of heavy\r\ninfantry and light-armed troops, besides a division of cavalry, about\r\nseventy in number. Their system was to push forward foraging parties in\r\nquest of wood and fruits, returning at nightfall to Piraeus. Of the city\r\nparty no one ventured to take the field under arms; only, from time to\r\ntime, the cavalry would capture stray pillagers from Piraeus or inflict\r\nsome damage on the main body of their opponents. Once they fell in with\r\na party belonging to the deme Aexone, (12) marching to their own farms\r\nin search of provisions. These, in spite of many prayers for mercy\r\nand the strong disapprobation of many of the knights, were ruthlessly\r\nslaughtered by Lysimachus, the general of cavalry. The men of Piraeus\r\nretaliated by putting to death a horseman, named Callistratus, of the\r\ntribe Leontis, whom they captured in the country. Indeed their courage\r\nran so high at present that they even meditated an assault upon the city\r\nwalls. And here perhaps the reader will pardon the record of a somewhat\r\ningenious device on the part of the city engineer, who, aware of the\r\nenemy's intention to advance his batteries along the racecourse, which\r\nslopes from the Lyceum, had all the carts and waggons which were to be\r\nfound laden with blocks of stone, each one a cartload in itself, and\r\nso sent them to deposit their freights \"pele-mele\" on the course in\r\nquestion. The annoyance created by these separate blocks of stone\r\nwas enormous, and quite out of proportion to the simplicity of the\r\ncontrivance.\r\n\r\n (12) On the coast south of Phalerum, celebrated for its fisheries. Cf.\r\n    \"Athen.\" vii. 325.\r\n\r\nBut it was to Lacedaemon that men's eyes now turned. The Thirty\r\ndespatched one set of ambassadors from Eleusis, while another set\r\nrepresenting the government of the city, that is to say the men on the\r\nlist, was despatched to summon the Lacedaemonians to their aid, on the\r\nplea that the people had revolted from Sparta. At Sparta, Lysander,\r\ntaking into account the possibility of speedily reducing the party in\r\nPiraeus by blockading them by land and sea, and so cutting them off from\r\nall supplies, supported the application, and negotiated the loan of\r\none hundred talents (13) to his clients, backed by the appointment of\r\nhimself as harmost on land, and of his brother, Libys, as admiral of\r\nthe fleet. And so proceeding to the scene of action at Eleusis, he got\r\ntogether a large body of Peloponnesian hoplites, whilst his brother,\r\nthe admiral, kept watch and ward by sea to prevent the importation of\r\nsupplies into Piraeus by water. Thus the men in Piraeus were soon again\r\nreduced to their former helplessness, while the ardour of the city folk\r\nrose to a proportionally high pitch under the auspices of Lysander.\r\n\r\n (13) 24,375 pounds, reckoning one tal. = 243 pounds 15 shillings.\r\n\r\nThings were progressing after this sort when King Pausanias intervened.\r\nTouched by a certain envy of Lysander--(who seemed, by a final stroke of\r\nachievement, about to reach the pinnacle of popularity, with Athens laid\r\nlike a pocket dependency at his feet)--the king persuaded three of\r\nthe ephors to support him, and forthwith called out the ban. With him\r\nmarched contingents of all the allied States, except the Boeotians and\r\nCorinthians. These maintained, that to undertake such an expedition\r\nagainst the Athenians, in whose conduct they saw nothing contrary to the\r\ntreaty, was inconsistent with their oaths. But if that was the language\r\nheld by them, the secret of their behaviour lay deeper; they seemed to\r\nbe aware of a desire on the part of the Lacedaemonians to annex the\r\nsoil of the Athenians and to reduce the state to vassalage. Pausanias\r\nencamped on the Halipedon, (14) as the sandy flat is called, with his\r\nright wing resting on Piraeus, and Lysander and his mercenaries forming\r\nthe left. His first act was to send an embassage to the party in\r\nPiraeus, calling upon them to retire peacably to their homes; when they\r\nrefused to obey, he made, as far as mere noise went, the semblance of an\r\nattack, with sufficient show of fight to prevent his kindly disposition\r\nbeing too apparent. But gaining nothing by the feint, he was forced to\r\nretire. Next day he took two Laconian regiments, with three tribes of\r\nAthenian horse, and crossed over to the Mute (15) Harbour, examining the\r\nlie of the ground to discover how and where it would be easiest to draw\r\nlines of circumvallation round Piraeus. As he turned his back to retire,\r\na party of the enemy sallied out and caused him annoyance. Nettled at\r\nthe liberty, he ordered the cavalry to charge at the gallop, supported\r\nby the ten-year-service (16) infantry, whilst he himself, with the rest\r\nof the troops, followed close, holding quietly back in reserve. They cut\r\ndown about thirty of the enemy's light troops and pursued the rest hotly\r\nto the theatre in Piraeus. Here, as chance would have it, the whole\r\nlight and heavy infantry of the Piraeus men were getting under arms;\r\nand in an instant their light troops rushed out and dashed at the\r\nassailants; thick and fast flew missiles of all sorts--javelins, arrows\r\nand sling stones. The Lacedaemonians finding the number of their wounded\r\nincreasing every minute, and sorely called, slowly fell back step by\r\nstep, eyeing their opponents. These meanwhile resolutely pressed on.\r\nHere fell Chaeron and Thibrachus, both polemarchs, here also Lacrates,\r\nan Olympic victor, and other Lacedaemonians, all of whom now lie\r\nentombed before the city gates in the Ceramicus. (17)\r\n\r\n (14) The Halipedon is the long stretch of flat sandy land between\r\n    Piraeus Phalerum and the city.\r\n\r\n (15) Perhaps the landlocked creek just round the promontory of\r\n    Eetioneia, as Leake conjectures, \"Topog. of Athens,\" p. 389. See\r\n    also Prof. Jowett's note, \"Thuc.\" v. 2; vol. ii. p. 286.\r\n\r\n (16) I.e. who had already seen ten years of service, i.e. over twenty-\r\n    eight, as the Spartan was eligible to serve at eighteen.

Arist. \"Birds,\" 395.\r\n\r\nWatching how matters went, Thrasybulus began his advance with the whole\r\nof his heavy infantry to support his light troops and quickly fell\r\ninto line eight deep, acting as a screen to the rest of his troops.\r\nPausanias, on his side, had retired, sorely pressed, about half a\r\nmile towards a bit of rising ground, where he sent orders to the\r\nLacedaemonians and the other allied troops to bring up reinforcements.\r\nHere, on this slope, he reformed his troops, giving his phalanx the\r\nfull depth, and advanced against the Athenians, who did not hesitate\r\nto receive him at close quarters, but presently had to give way; one\r\nportion being forced into the mud and clay at Halae, (18) while the\r\nothers wavered and broke their line; one hundred and fifty of them were\r\nleft dead on the field, whereupon Pausanias set up a trophy and retired.\r\nNot even so, were his feelings embittered against his adversary. On the\r\ncontrary he sent secretly and instructed the men of Piraeus, what sort\r\nof terms they should propose to himself and the ephors in attendance.\r\nTo this advice they listened. He also fostered a division in the party\r\nwithin the city. A deputation, acting on his orders, sought an audience\r\nof him and the ephors. It had all the appearance of a mass meeting. In\r\napproaching the Spartan authorities, they had no desire or occasion,\r\nthey stated, to look upon the men of Piraeus as enemies, they would\r\nprefer a general reconciliation and the friendship of both sides with\r\nLacedaemon. The propositions were favourably received, and by no less a\r\nperson than Nauclidas. He was present as ephor, in accordance with the\r\ncustom which obliges two members of that board to serve on all military\r\nexpeditions with the king, and with his colleague shared the political\r\nviews represented by Pausanias, rather than those of Lysander and his\r\nparty. Thus the authorities were quite ready to despatch to Lacedaemon\r\nthe representatives of Piraeus, carrying their terms of truce with the\r\nLacedaemonians, as also two private individuals belonging to the city\r\nparty, whose names were Cephisophon and Meletus. This double deputation,\r\nhowever, had no sooner set out to Lacedaemon than the \"de facto\"\r\ngovernment of the city followed suit, by sending a third set of\r\nrepresentatives to state on their behalf: that they were prepared to\r\ndeliver up themselves and the fortifications in their possession to\r\nthe Lacedaemonians, to do with them what they liked. \"Are the men of\r\nPiraeus,\" they asked, \"prepared to surrender Piraeus and Munychia in\r\nthe same way? If they are sincere in their profession of friendship to\r\nLacedaemon, they ought to do so.\" The ephors and the members of assembly\r\nat Sparta (19) gave audience to these several parties, and sent\r\nout fifteen commissioners to Athens empowered, in conjunction with\r\nPausanias, to discover the best settlement possible. The terms (20)\r\narrived at were that a general peace between the rival parties should be\r\nestablished, liberty to return to their own homes being granted to all,\r\nwith the exception of the Thirty, the Eleven, and the Ten who had been\r\ngovernors in Piraeus; but a proviso was added, enabling any of the city\r\nparty who feared to remain at Athens to find a home in Eleusis.\r\n\r\n (18) Halae, the salt marshy ground immediately behind the great\r\n    harbour of Piraeus, but outside the fortification lines.\r\n\r\n (19) Cf. \"Hell.\" VI. iii. 3, {oi ekkletoi}.\r\n\r\n (20) Cf. Prof. Jebb, \"Orators,\" i. 262, note 2.\r\n\r\nAnd now that everything was happily concluded, Pausanias disbanded his\r\narmy, and the men from Piraeus marched up under arms into the acropolis\r\nand offered sacrifice to Athena. When they were come down, the generals\r\ncalled a meeting of the Ecclesia, (21) and Thrasybulus made a speech in\r\nwhich, addressing the city party, he said: \"Men of the city! I have one\r\npiece of advice I would tender to you; it is that you should learn to\r\nknow yourselves, and towards the attainment of that self-knowledge I\r\nwould have you make a careful computation of your good qualities and\r\nsatisfy yourselves on the strength of which of these it is that you\r\nclaim to rule over us. Is it that you are more just than ourselves? Yet\r\nthe people, who are poorer--have never wronged you for the purposes of\r\nplunder; but you, whose wealth would outweight the whole of ours, have\r\nwrought many a shameful deed for the sake of gain. If, then, you have\r\nno monopoly of justice, can it be on the score of courage that you are\r\nwarranted to hold your heads so high? If so, what fairer test of courage\r\nwill you propose than the arbitrament of war--the war just ended? Or do\r\nyou claim superiority of intelligence?--you, who with all your wealth of\r\narms and walls, money and Peloponnesian allies, have been paralysed by\r\nmen who had none of these things to aid them! Or is it on these Laconian\r\nfriends of yours that you pride yourselves? What! when these same\r\nfriends have dealt by you as men deal by vicious dogs. You know how that\r\nis. They put a heavy collar round the neck of the brutes and hand them\r\nover muzzled to their masters. So too have the Lacedaemonians handed you\r\nover to the people, this very people whom you have injured; and now they\r\nhave turned their backs and are gone. But\" (turning to the mass) \"do\r\nnot misconceive me. It is not for me, sirs, coldly to beg of you, in no\r\nrespect to violate your solemn undertakings. I go further; I beg you,\r\nto crown your list of exploits by one final display of virtue. Show\r\nthe world that you can be faithful to your oaths, and flawless in your\r\nconduct.\" By these and other kindred arguments he impressed upon them\r\nthat there was no need for anarchy or disorder, seeing that there were\r\nthe ancient laws ready for use. And so he broke up (22) the assembly.\r\n\r\n (21) I.e. the Public Assembly, see above; and reading with Sauppe\r\n    after Cobet {ekklesian epoiesan}, which words are supposed to have\r\n    dropt out of the MSS. Or, keeping to the MSS., translate \"When the\r\n    generals were come down, Thrasybulus,\" etc. See next note.\r\n\r\n (22) The Greek words are {antestese ten ekklesian} (an odd phrase for\r\n    the more technical {eluse} or {dieluse ten ekklesian}). Or,\r\n    accepting the MSS. reading above (see last note), translate \"he\r\n    set up (i.e. restored) the Assembly.\" So Mr. J. G. Philpotts, Mr.\r\n    Herbert Hailstone, and others.\r\n\r\nAt this auspicious moment, then, they reappointed the several\r\nmagistrates; the constitution began to work afresh, and civic life was\r\nrecommenced. At a subsequent period, on receiving information that the\r\nparty at Eleusis were collecting a body of mercenaries, they marched out\r\nwith their whole force against them, and put to death their generals,\r\nwho came out to parley. These removed, they introduced to the others\r\ntheir friends and connections, and so persuaded them to come to terms\r\nand be reconciled. The oath they bound themselves by consisted of a\r\nsimple asseveration: \"We will remember past offences no more;\" and to\r\nthis day (23) the two parties live amicably together as good citizens,\r\nand the democracy is steadfast to its oaths.\r\n\r\n (23) It would be interesting to know the date at which the author\r\n    penned these words. Was this portion of the \"Hellenica\" written\r\n    before the expedition of Cyrus? i.e. in the interval between the\r\n    formal restoration of the Democracy, September B.C. 403, and March\r\n    B.C. 401. The remaining books of the \"Hellenica\" were clearly\r\n    written after that expedition, since reference is made to it quite\r\n    early in Bk. III. i. 2. Practically, then, the first volume of\r\n    Xenophon's \"History of Hellenic Affairs\" ends here. This history\r\n    is resumed in Bk. III. i. 3. after the Cyreian expedition  (of\r\n    which episode we have a detailed account in the \"Anabasis\" from\r\n    March B.C. 401 down to March B.C. 399, when the remnant of the Ten\r\n    Thousand was handed over to the Spartan general Thibron in Asia).\r\n    Some incidents belonging to B.C. 402 are referred to in the\r\n    opening paragraphs of \"Hellenica,\" III. i. 1, 2, but only as an\r\n    introduction to the new matter; and with regard to the historian\r\n    himself, it is clear that \"a change has come o'er the spirit of\r\n    his dream.\" This change of view is marked by a change of style in\r\n    writing. I have thought it legitimate, under the circumstances, to\r\n    follow the chronological order of events, and instead of\r\n    continuing the \"Hellenica,\" at this point to insert the\r\n    \"Anabasis.\" My next volume will contain the remaining books of the\r\n    \"Hellenica\" and the rest of Xenophon's \"historical\" writings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nB.C. 403-402. Thus the civil strife at Athens had an end. At a\r\nsubsequent date Cyrus sent messengers to Lacedaemon, claiming requital\r\nin kind for the service which he had lately rendered in the war with\r\nAthens. (1) The demand seemed to the ephorate just and reasonable.\r\nAccordingly they ordered Samius, (2) who was admiral at the time, to\r\nput himself at the disposition of Cyrus for any service which he might\r\nrequire. Samius himself needed no persuasion to carry out the wishes of\r\nCyrus. With his own fleet, accompanied by that of Cyrus, he sailed round\r\nto Cilicia, and so made it impossible for Syennesis, the ruler of that\r\nprovince, to oppose Cyrus by land in his advance against the king his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n (1) Lit. \"what Cyrus himself had been to the Lacedaemonians let the\r\n    Lacedaemonians in their turn be to Cyrus.\"\r\n\r\n (2) Samius (Diod. Sic. xiv. 19). But see \"Anab.\" I. iv. 2, where\r\n    Pythagoras is named as admiral. Possibly the one officer succeeded\r\n    the other.\r\n\r\nB.C. 401. The particulars of the expedition are to be found in the pages\r\nof the Syracusan Themistogenes, (3) who describes the mustering of the\r\narmament, and the advance of Cyrus at the head of his troops; and then\r\nthe battle, and death of Cyrus himself, and the consequent retreat of\r\nthe Hellenes while effecting their escape to the sea. (4)\r\n\r\n (3) Lit. \"as to how then Cyrus collected an army and with it went up\r\n    against his brother, and how the battle was fought and how he\r\n    died, and how in the sequel the Hellenes escaped to the sea (all\r\n    this), is written by (or 'for,' or 'in honour of') Themistogenes\r\n    the Syracusan.\" My impression is that Xenophon's \"Anabasis,\" or a\r\n    portion of the work so named, was edited originally by\r\n    Themistogenes. See \"Philol. Museum,\" vol. i. p. 489; L. Dindorf,\r\n    {Xen. Ell.}, Ox. MDCCCLIII., node ad loc. {Themistogenei}. Cf.\r\n    Diod. Sic. xiv. 19-31, 37, after Ephorus and Theopompus probably.\r\n\r\n (4) At Trapezus, March 10, B.C. 400.\r\n\r\nB.C. 400. It was in recognition of the service which he had rendered in\r\nthis affair, that Tissaphernes was despatched to Lower Asia by the king\r\nhis master. He came as satrap, not only of his own provinces, but of\r\nthose which had belonged to Cyrus; and he at once demanded the absolute\r\nsubmission of the Ionic cities, without exception, to his authority.\r\nThese communities, partly from a desire to maintain their freedom, and\r\npartly from fear of Tissaphernes himself, whom they had rejected in\r\nfavour of Cyrus during the lifetime of that prince, were loth to admit\r\nthe satrap within their gates. They thought it better to send an embassy\r\nto the Lacedaemonians, calling upon them as representatives and leaders\r\n(5) of the Hellenic world to look to the interests of their petitioners,\r\nwho were Hellenes also, albeit they lived in Asia, and not to suffer\r\ntheir country to be ravaged and themselves enslaved.\r\n\r\n (5) {Prostatai}, \"patrons and protectors.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this appeal, the Lacedaemonians sent out Thibron (6)\r\nas governor, providing him with a body of troops, consisting of one\r\nthousand neodamodes (7) (i.e. enfranchised helots) and four thousand\r\nPeloponnesians. In addition to these, Thibron himself applied to\r\nthe Athenians for a detachment of three hundred horse, for whose\r\nservice-money he would hold himself responsible. The Athenians in\r\nanswer sent him some of the knights who had served under the Thirty,\r\n(8) thinking that the people of Athens would be well rid of them if they\r\nwent abroad and perished there.\r\n\r\n (6) \"As harmost.\" See \"Anab.\" ad fin.\r\n\r\n (7) See \"Hell.\" I. iii. 15; Thuc. vii. 58.\r\n\r\n (8) See \"Hell.\" II. iv. 2.\r\n\r\nB.C. 400-399. On their arrival in Asia, Thibron further collected\r\ncontingents from the Hellenic cities on the continent; for at this time\r\nthe word of a Lacedaemonian was law. He had only to command, and every\r\ncity must needs obey. (9) But although he had this armament, Thibron,\r\nwhen he saw the cavalry, had no mind to descend into the plain. If he\r\nsucceeded in protecting from pillage the particular district in which\r\nhe chanced to be, he was quite content. It was only when the troops (10)\r\nwho had taken part in the expedition of Cyrus had joined him on their\r\nsafe return, that he assumed a bolder attitude. He was now ready to\r\nconfront Tissaphernes, army against army, on the level ground, and won\r\nover a number of cities. Pergamum came in of her own accord. So did\r\nTeuthrania and Halisarna. These were under the government of Eurysthenes\r\nand Procles, (11) the descendants of Demaratus the Lacedaemonian, who\r\nin days of old had received this territory as a gift from the Persian\r\nmonarch in return for his share in the campaign against Hellas. Gorgion\r\nand Gongylus, two brothers, also gave in their adhesion; they were\r\nlords, the one of Gambreum and Palae-Gambreum, the other of Myrina and\r\nGryneum, four cities which, like those above named, had originally\r\nbeen gifts from the king to an earlier Gongylus--the sole Eretrian who\r\n\"joined the Mede,\" and in consequence was banished. Other cities which\r\nwere too weak to resist, Thibron took by force of arms. In the case of\r\none he was not so successful. This was the Egyptian (12) Larisa, as it\r\nis called, which refused to capitulate, and was forthwith invested and\r\nsubjected to a regular siege. When all other attempts to take it failed,\r\nhe set about digging a tank or reservoir, and in connection with the\r\ntank an underground channel, by means of which he proposed to draw off\r\nthe water supply of the inhabitants. In this he was baffled by frequent\r\nsallies of the besieged, and a continual discharge of timber and stones\r\ninto the cutting. He retaliated by the construction of a wooden tortoise\r\nwhich he erected over the tank; but once more the tortoise was burnt to\r\na cinder in a successful night attack on the part of the men of Larisa.\r\nThese ineffectual efforts induced the ephors to send a despatch bidding\r\nThibron give up Larisa and march upon Caria.\r\n\r\n (9) See \"Anab.\" VI. vi. 12.\r\n\r\n (10) March B.C. 399. See the final sentence of the \"Anabasis.\"\r\n\r\n (11) See \"Anab.\" VII. viii. 8-16.\r\n\r\n (12) Seventy stades S.E. of Cyme in the Aeolid. See Strabo, xiii. 621.\r\n    For the origin of the name cf. \"Cyrop.\" VII. i. 45.\r\n\r\nHe had already reached Ephesus, and was on the point of marching into\r\nCaria, when Dercylidas arrived to take command of his army. The new\r\ngeneral was a man whose genius for invention had won him the nickname of\r\nSisyphus. Thus it was that Thibron returned home, where on his arrival\r\nhe was fined and banished, the allies accusing him of allowing his\r\ntroops to plunder their friends.\r\n\r\nDercylidas was not slow to perceive and turn to account the jealousy\r\nwhich subsisted between Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus. Coming to\r\nterms with the former, he marched into the territory of the latter,\r\npreferring, as he said, to be at war with one of the pair at a time,\r\nrather than the two together. His hostility, indeed, to Pharnabazus was\r\nan old story, dating back to a period during the naval command (13)\r\nof Lysander, when he was himself governor in Abydos; where, thanks to\r\nPharnabazus, he had got into trouble with his superior officer, and had\r\nbeen made to stand \"with his shield on his arm\"--a stigma on his honour\r\nwhich no true Lacedaemonian would forgive, since this is the punishment\r\nof insubordination. (14) For this reason, doubtless, Dercylidas had the\r\ngreater satisfaction in marching against Pharnabazus. From the moment he\r\nassumed command there was a marked difference for the better between his\r\nmethods and those of his predecessor. Thus he contrived to conduct his\r\ntroops into that portion of the Aeolid which belonged to Pharnabazus,\r\nthrough the heart of friendly territory without injury to the allies.\r\n\r\n (13) Technically \"navarchy,\" in B.C. 408-407. \"Hell.\" I. v. 1.\r\n\r\n (14) See Plut. \"Aristid.\" 23 (Clough, ii. p. 309).\r\n\r\nThis district of Aeolis belonged to Pharnabazus, (15) but had been held\r\nas a satrapy under him by a Dardanian named Zenis whilst he was alive;\r\nbut when Zenis fell sick and died, Pharnabazus made preparation to give\r\nthe satrapy to another. Then Mania the wife of Zenis, herself also a\r\nDardanian, fitted out an expedition, and taking with her gifts wherewith\r\nto make a present to Pharnabazus himself, and to gratify his concubines\r\nand those whose power was greatest with Pharnabazus, set forth on her\r\njourney. When she had obtained audience with him she spoke as follows:\r\n\"O Pharnabazus, thou knowest that thy servant my husband was in all\r\nrespects friendly to thee; moreover, he paid my lord the tributes which\r\nwere thy due, so that thou didst praise and honour him. Now therefore,\r\nif I do thee service as faithfully as my husband, why needest thou to\r\nappoint another satrap?--nay but, if in any matter I please thee not, is\r\nit not in thy power to take from me the government on that day, and to\r\ngive it to another?\" When he had heard her words, Pharnabazus decided\r\nthat the woman ought to be satrap. She, as soon as she was mistress of\r\nthe territory, never ceased to render the tribute in due season, even\r\nas her husband before her had done. Moreover, whenever she came to the\r\ncourt of Pharnabazus she brought him gifts continually, and whenever\r\nPharnabazus went down to visit her provinces she welcomed him with all\r\nfair and courteous entertainment beyond what his other viceroys were\r\nwont to do. The cities also which had been left to her by her husband,\r\nshe guarded safely for him; while of those cities that owed her no\r\nallegiance, she acquired, on the seaboard, Larisa and Hamaxitus and\r\nColonae--attacking their walls by aid of Hellenic mercenaries, whilst\r\nshe herself sat in her carriage and watched the spectacle. Nor was\r\nshe sparing of her gifts to those who won her admiration; and thus she\r\nfurnished herself with a mercenary force of exceptional splendour. She\r\nalso went with Pharnabazus on his campaigns, even when, on pretext of\r\nsome injury done to the king's territory, Mysians or Pisidians were the\r\nobject of attack. In requital, Pharnabazus paid her magnificent honour,\r\nand at times invited her to assist him with her counsel. (16)\r\n\r\n (15) I.e. as suzerain.\r\n\r\n (16) Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 292; cf. Herod. viii. 69.\r\n\r\nNow when Mania was more than forty years old, the husband of her own\r\ndaughter, Meidias--flustered by the suggestions of certain people who\r\nsaid that it was monstrous a woman should rule and he remain a private\r\nperson (17)--found his way into her presence, as the story goes, and\r\nstrangled her. For Mania, albeit she carefully guarded herself against\r\nall ordinary comers, as behoved her in the exercise of her \"tyranny,\"\r\ntrusted in Meidias, and, as a woman might her own son-in-law, was ready\r\nto greet him at all times with open arms. He also murdered her son, a\r\nyouth of marvellous beauty, who was about seventeen years of age. He\r\nnext seized upon the strong cities of Scepsis and Gergithes, in which\r\nlay for the most part the property and wealth of Mania. As for the\r\nother cities of the satrapy, they would not receive the usurper, their\r\ngarrisons keeping them safely for Pharnabazus. Thereupon Meidias sent\r\ngifts to Pharnabazus, and claimed to hold the district even as Mania\r\nhad held it; to whom the other answered, \"Keep your gifts and guard them\r\nsafely until that day when I shall come in person and take both you\r\nand them together\"; adding, \"What care I to live longer if I avenge not\r\nmyself for the murder of Mania!\"\r\n\r\n (17) Or, \"his brains whimsied with insinuations.\"\r\n\r\nJust at the critical moment Dercylidas arrived, and in a single day\r\nreceived the adhesion of the three seaboard cities Larisa, Hamaxitus,\r\nand Colonae--which threw open their gates to him. Then he sent\r\nmessengers to the cities of the Aeolid also, offering them freedom if\r\nthey would receive him within their walls and become allies. Accordingly\r\nthe men of Neandria and Ilium and Cocylium lent willing ears; for since\r\nthe death of Mania their Hellenic garrisons had been treated but ill.\r\nBut the commander of the garrison in Cebrene, a place of some strength,\r\nbethinking him that if he should succeed in guarding that city for\r\nPharnabazus, he would receive honour at his hands, refused to admit\r\nDercylidas. Whereupon the latter, in a rage, prepared to take the place\r\nby force; but when he came to sacrifice, on the first day the victims\r\nwould not yield good omens; on the second, and again upon the third day,\r\nit was the same story. Thus for as many as four days he persevered in\r\nsacrificing, cherishing wrath the while--for he was in haste to become\r\nmaster of the whole Aeolid before Pharnabazus came to the succour of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a certain Sicyonian captain, Athenadas by name, said to\r\nhimself: \"Dercylidas does but trifle to waste his time here, whilst\r\nI with my own hand can draw off their water from the men of Cybrene\";\r\nwherewith he ran forward with his division and essayed to choke up the\r\nspring which supplied the city. But the garrison sallied out and covered\r\nthe Sicyonian himself with wounds, besides killing two of his men.\r\nIndeed, they plied their swords and missiles with such good effect that\r\nthe whole company was forced to beat a retreat. Dercylidas was not a\r\nlittle annoyed, thinking that now the spirit of the besiegers would\r\ncertainly die away; but whilst he was in this mood, behold! there\r\narrived from the beleaguered fortress emissaries of the Hellenes, who\r\nstated that the action taken by the commandant was not to their taste;\r\nfor themselves, they would far rather be joined in bonds of fellowship\r\nwith Hellenes than with barbarians. While the matter was still under\r\ndiscussion there came a messenger also from the commandant, to say that\r\nwhatever the former deputation had proposed he, on his side, was ready\r\nto endorse. Accordingly Dercylidas, who, it so happened, had at length\r\nobtained favourable omens on that day, marched his force without more\r\nado up to the gates of the city, which were flung open by those\r\nwithin; and so he entered. (18) Here, then, he was content to appoint a\r\ngarrison, and without further stay advanced upon Scepsis and Gergithes.\r\n\r\n (18) Grote (\"H. G.\" ix. 294) says: \"The reader will remark how\r\n    Xenophon shapes the narrative in such a manner as to inculcate the\r\n    pious duty in a general of obeying the warnings furnished by the\r\n    sacrifice--either for action or for inaction.... Such an\r\n    inference is never (I believe) to be found suggested in\r\n    Thucydides.\" See Brietenbach, \"Xen. Hell.\" I et II, praef. in\r\n    alteram ed. p. xvii.\r\n\r\nAnd now Meidias, partly expecting the hostile advance of Pharnabazus,\r\nand partly mistrusting the citizens--for to such a pass things had\r\ncome--sent to Dercylidas, proposing to meet him in conference provided\r\nhe might take security of hostages. In answer to this suggestion the\r\nother sent him one man from each of the cities of the allies, and bade\r\nhim take his pick of these, whichsoever and how many soever he chose, as\r\nhostages for his own security. Meidias selected ten, and so went out. In\r\nconversation with Dercylidas, he asked him on what terms he would accept\r\nhis alliance. The other answered: \"The terms are that you grant the\r\ncitizens freedom and self-government.\" The words were scarcely out of\r\nhis mouth before he began marching upon Scepsis. Whereupon Meidias,\r\nperceiving it was vain to hinder him in the teeth of the citizens,\r\nsuffered him to enter. That done, Dercylidas offered sacrifice to Athena\r\nin the citadel of the Scepsians, turned out the bodyguards of Meidias,\r\nand handed over the city to the citizens. And so, having admonished them\r\nto regulate their civic life as Hellenes and free men ought, he left the\r\nplace and continued his advance against Gergithes. On this last march\r\nhe was escorted by many of the Scepsians themselves; such was the honour\r\nthey paid him and so great their satisfaction at his exploits. Meidias\r\nalso followed close at his side, petitioning that he would hand over the\r\ncity of Gergithians to himself. To whom Dercylidas only made reply,\r\nthat he should not fail to obtain any of his just rights. And whilst the\r\nwords were yet upon his lips, he was drawing close to the gates, with\r\nMeidias at his side. Behind him followed the troops, marching two\r\nand two in peaceful fashion. The defenders of Gergithes from their\r\ntowers--which were extraordinarily high--espied Meidias in company of\r\nthe Spartan, and abstained from shooting. And Dercylidas said: \"Bid them\r\nopen the gates, Meidias, when you shall lead the way, and I will enter\r\nthe temple along with you and do sacrifice to Athena.\" And Meidias,\r\nthough he shrank from opening the gates, yet in terror of finding\r\nhimself on a sudden seized, reluctantly gave the order to open the\r\ngates. As soon as he was entered in, the Spartan, still taking Meidias\r\nwith him, marched up to the citadel and there ordered the main body of\r\nhis soldiers to take up their position round the walls, whilst he with\r\nthose about him did sacrifice to Athena. When the sacrifice was ended he\r\nordered Meidias's bodyguard to pile arms (19) in the van of his troops.\r\nHere for the future they would serve as mercenaries, since Meidias their\r\nformer master stood no longer in need of their protection. The latter,\r\nbeing at his wits' end what to do, exclaimed: \"Look you, I will now\r\nleave you; I go to make preparation for my guest.\" But the other\r\nreplied: \"Heaven forbid! Ill were it that I who have offered sacrifice\r\nshould be treated as a guest by you. I rather should be the entertainer\r\nand you the guest. Pray stay with us, and while the supper is preparing,\r\nyou and I can consider our obligations, and perform them.\"\r\n\r\n (19) I.e. take up a position, or \"to order arms,\" whilst he addressed\r\n    them; not probably \"to ground arms,\" as if likely to be mutinous.\r\n\r\nWhen they were seated Dercylidas put certain questions: \"Tell me,\r\nMeidias, did your father leave you heir to his estates?\" \"Certainly he\r\ndid,\" answered the other. \"And how many dwelling-houses have you? what\r\nlanded estates? how much pasturage?\" The other began running off\r\nan inventory, whilst some of the Scepsians who were present kept\r\ninterposing, \"He is lying to you, Dercylidas.\" \"Nay, you take too minute\r\na view of matters,\" replied the Spartan. When the inventory of the\r\npaternal property was completed, he proceeded: \"Tell me, Meidias, to\r\nwhom did Mania belong?\" A chorus of voices rejoined, \"To Pharnabazus.\"\r\n\"Then must her property have belonged to Pharnabazus too.\" \"Certainly,\"\r\nthey answered. \"Then it must now be ours,\" he remarked, \"by right of\r\nconquest, since Pharnabazus is at war with us. Will some one of you\r\nescort me to the place where the property of Mania and Pharnabazus\r\nlies?\" So the rest led the way to the dwelling-place of Mania which\r\nMeidias had taken from her, and Meidias followed too. When he was\r\nentered, Dercylidas summoned the stewards, and bidding his attendants\r\nseize them, gave them to understand that, if detected stealing anything\r\nwhich belonged to Mania, they would lose their heads on the spot. The\r\nstewards proceeded to point out the treasures, and he, when he had\r\nlooked through the whole store, bolted and barred the doors, affixing\r\nhis seal, and setting a watch. As he went out he found at the doors\r\ncertain of the generals (20) and captains, and said to them: \"Here,\r\nsirs, we have pay ready made for the army--a year's pay nearly for eight\r\nthousand men--and if we can win anything besides, there will be so much\r\nthe more.\" This he said, knowing that those who heard it would be all\r\nthe more amenable to discipline, and would yield him a more flattering\r\nobedience. Then Meidias asked, \"And where am I to live, Dercylidas?\"\r\n\"Where you have the very best right to live,\" replied the other, \"in\r\nyour native town of Scepsis, and in your father's house.\"\r\n\r\n (20) Lit. \"of the taxiarchs and lochagoi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSuch were the exploits of Dercylidas: nine cities taken in eight days.\r\nTwo considerations now began to occupy his mind: how was he to avoid\r\nfalling into the fatal error of Thibron and becoming a burthen to his\r\nallies, whilst wintering in a friendly country? how, again, was he to\r\nprevent Pharnabazus from overriding the Hellenic states in pure contempt\r\nwith his cavalry? Accordingly he sent to Pharnabazus and put it to him\r\npoint-blank: Which will you have, peace or war? Whereupon Pharnabazus,\r\nwho could not but perceive that the whole Aeolid had now been converted\r\npractically into a fortified base of operations, which threatened his\r\nown homestead of Phrygia, chose peace.\r\n\r\nB.C. 399-398. This being so, Dercylidas advanced into Bithynian Thrace,\r\nand there spent the winter; nor did Pharnabazus exhibit a shadow of\r\nannoyance, since the Bithynians were perpetually at war with himself.\r\nFor the most part, Dercylidas continued to harry (1) Bithynia in perfect\r\nsecurity, and found provisions without stint. Presently he was joined\r\nfrom the other side of the straits by some Odrysian allies sent by\r\nSeuthes; (2) they numbered two hundred horse and three hundred peltasts.\r\nThese fellows pitched upon a site a little more than a couple of miles\r\n(3) from the Hellenic force, where they entrenched themselves; then\r\nhaving got from Dercylidas some heavy infantry soldiers to act as\r\nguards of their encampment, they devoted themselves to plundering,\r\nand succeeded in capturing an ample store of slaves and other wealth.\r\nPresently their camp was full of prisoners, when one morning the\r\nBithynians, having ascertained the actual numbers of the marauding\r\nparties as well as of the Hellenes left as guards behind, collected in\r\nlarge masses of light troops and cavalry, and attacked the garrison,\r\nwho were not more than two hundred strong. As soon as they came close\r\nenough, they began discharging spears and other missiles on the little\r\nbody, who on their side continued to be wounded and shot down, but were\r\nquite unable to retaliate, cooped up as they were within a palisading\r\nbarely six feet high, until in desperation they tore down their defences\r\nwith their own hands, and dashed at the enemy. These had nothing to do\r\nbut to draw back from the point of egress, and being light troops easily\r\nescaped beyond the grasp of heavy-armed men, while ever and again, from\r\none point of vantage or another, they poured their shower of javelins,\r\nand at every sally laid many a brave man low, till at length, like\r\nsheep penned in a fold, the defenders were shot down almost to a man. A\r\nremnant, it is true, did escape, consisting of some fifteen who, seeing\r\nthe turn affairs were taking, had already made off in the middle of the\r\nfighting. Slipping through their assailants' fingers, (4) to the small\r\nconcern of the Bithynians, they reached the main Hellenic camp in\r\nsafety. The Bithynians, satisfied with their achievement, part of which\r\nconsisted in cutting down the tent guards of the Odrysian Thracians and\r\nrecovering all their prisoners, made off without delay; so that by the\r\ntime the Hellenes got wind of the affair and rallied to the rescue, they\r\nfound nothing left in the camp save only the stripped corpses of the\r\nslain. When the Odrysians themselves returned, they fell to burying\r\ntheir own dead, quaffing copious draughts of wine in their honour and\r\nholding horse-races; but for the future they deemed it advisable to\r\ncamp along with the Hellenes. Thus they harried and burned Bithynia the\r\nwinter through.\r\n\r\n (1) {Pheson kai agon}, i.e. \"there was plenty of live stock to lift\r\n    and chattels to make away with.\"\r\n\r\n (2) For Seuthes see \"Anab.\" VII. i. 5; and below, IV. viii. 26.\r\n\r\n (3) Lit. \"twenty stades.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"slipping through the enemy's fingers, who took no heed of\r\n    them, they,\" etc.\r\n\r\nB.C. 398. With the commencement of spring Dercylidas turned his back\r\nupon the Bithynians and came to Lampsacus. Whilst at this place envoys\r\nreached him from the home authorities. These were Aracus, Naubates, and\r\nAntisthenes. They were sent to inquire generally into the condition of\r\naffairs in Asia, and to inform Dercylidas of the extension of his office\r\nfor another year. They had been further commissioned by the ephors to\r\nsummon a meeting of the soldiers and inform them that the ephors\r\nheld them to blame for their former doings, though for their present\r\navoidance of evil conduct they must needs praise them; and for the\r\nfuture they must understand that while no repetition of misdoing would\r\nbe tolerated, all just and upright dealing by the allies would receive\r\nits meed of praise. The soldiers were therefore summoned, and the envoys\r\ndelivered their message, to which the leader of the Cyreians answered:\r\n\"Nay, men of Lacedaemon, listen; we are the same to-day as we were last\r\nyear; only our general of to-day is different from our general in the\r\npast. If to-day we have avoided our offence of yesterday, the cause is\r\nnot far to seek; you may discover it for yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nAracus and the other envoys shared the hospitality of Dercylidas's tent,\r\nand one of the party chanced to mention how they had left an embassy\r\nfrom the men of Chersonese in Lacedaemon. According to their statement,\r\nhe added, it was impossible for them to till their land nowadays, so\r\nperpetually were they robbed and plundered by the Thracians; whereas\r\nthe peninsula needed only to be walled across from sea to sea, and there\r\nwould be abundance of good land to cultivate--enough for themselves and\r\nas many others from Lacedaemon as cared to come. \"So that it would not\r\nsurprise us,\" continued the envoys, \"if a Lacedaemonian were actually\r\nsent out from Sparta with a force to carry out the project.\" Dercylidas\r\nkept his ears open but his counsel close, and so sent forward the\r\ncommissioners to Ephesus. (5) It pleased him to picture their progress\r\nthrough the Hellenic cities, and the spectacle of peace and prosperity\r\nwhich would everywhere greet their eyes. When he knew that his stay was\r\nto be prolonged, he sent again to Pharnabazus and offered him once more\r\nas an alternative either the prolongation of the winter truce or war.\r\nAnd once again Pharnabazus chose truce. It was thus that Dercylidas was\r\nable to leave the cities in the neighbourhood of the satrap (6) in peace\r\nand friendship. Crossing the Hellespont himself he brought his army\r\ninto Europe, and marching through Thrace, which was also friendly, was\r\nentertained by Seuthes, (7) and so reached the Chersonese.\r\n\r\n (5) See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 301.\r\n\r\n (6) Or, reading after Cobet, {tas peri ekeina poleis}--\"the cities of\r\n    that neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\n (7) See \"Anab.\" VII. vii. 51.\r\n\r\nThis district, he soon discovered, not only contained something like a\r\ndozen cities, (8) but was singularly fertile. The soil was of the best,\r\nbut ruined by the ravages of the Thracians, precisely as he had been\r\ntold. Accordingly, having measured and found the breadth of the isthmus\r\nbarely four miles, (9) he no longer hesitated. Having offered sacrifice,\r\nhe commenced his line of wall, distributing the area to the soldiers in\r\ndetachments, and promising to award them prizes for their industry--a\r\nfirst prize for the section first completed, and the rest as each\r\ndetachment of workers might deserve. By this means the whole wall begun\r\nin spring was finished before autumn. Within these lines he established\r\neleven cities, with numerous harbours, abundance of good arable land,\r\nand plenty of land under plantation, besides magnificent grazing grounds\r\nfor sheep and cattle of every kind.\r\n\r\n (8) Lit. \"eleven or twelve cities.\" For the natural productivity, see\r\n    \"Anab.\" V. vi. 25.\r\n\r\n (9) Lit. \"thirty-seven stades.\" Mod. Gallipoli. See Herod. vi. 36;\r\n    Plut. \"Pericl.\" xix.\r\n\r\nHaving finished the work, he crossed back again into Asia, and on a\r\ntour of inspection, found the cities for the most part in a thriving\r\ncondition; but when he came to Atarneus he discovered that certain\r\nexiles from Chios had got possession of the stronghold, which served\r\nthem as a convenient base for pillaging and plundering Ionia; and this,\r\nin fact, was their means of livelihood. Being further informed of the\r\nlarge supplies of grain which they had inside, he proceeded to draw\r\nentrenchments around the place with a view to a regular investment, and\r\nby this means he reduced it in eight months. Then having appointed Draco\r\nof Pellene (10) commandant, he stocked the fortress with an abundance of\r\nprovisions of all sorts, to serve him as a halting-place when he chanced\r\nto pass that way, and so withdrew to Ephesus, which is three days'\r\njourney from Sardis.\r\n\r\n (10) Cf. Isocr. \"Panegyr.\" 70; Jebb. \"Att. Or.\" ii. p. 161. Of Pellene\r\n    (or Pellana) in Laconia, not Pellene in Achaia? though that is the\r\n    opinion of Grote and Thirlwall.\r\n\r\nB.C. 397. Up to this date peace had been maintained between Tissaphernes\r\nand Dercylidas, as also between the Hellenes and the barbarians in those\r\nparts. But the time came when an embassy arrived at Lacedaemon from the\r\nIonic cities, protesting that Tissaphernes might, if he chose, leave the\r\nHellenic cities independent. \"Our idea,\" they added, \"is, that if Caria,\r\nthe home of Tissaphernes, felt the pinch of war, the satrap would very\r\nsoon agree to grant us independence.\" The ephors, on hearing this, sent\r\na despatch to Dercylidas, and bade him cross the frontier with his army\r\ninto Caria, whilst Pharax the admiral coasted round with the fleet.\r\nThese orders were carried out. Meanwhile a visitor had reached\r\nTissaphernes. This was not less a person than Pharnabazus. His coming\r\nwas partly owing to the fact that Tissaphernes had been appointed\r\ngeneral-in-chief, and party in order to testify his readiness to make\r\ncommon cause with his brother satrap in fighting and expelling the\r\nHellenes from the king's territory; for if his heart was stirred by\r\njealousy on account of the generalship bestowed upon his rival, he\r\nwas not the less aggrieved at finding himself robbed of the Aeolid.\r\nTissaphernes, lending willing ears to the proposal, had answered: \"First\r\ncross over with me in Caria, and then we will take counsel on these\r\nmatters.\" But being arrived in Caria, they determined to establish\r\ngarrisons of some strength in the various fortresses, and so crossed\r\nback again into Ionia.\r\n\r\nHearing that the satraps had recrossed the Maeander, Dercylidas\r\ngrew apprehensive for the district which lay there unprotected. \"If\r\nTissaphernes and Pharnabazus,\" he said to Pharax, \"chose to make a\r\ndescent, they could harry the country right and left.\" In this mind he\r\nfollowed suit, and recrossed the frontier too. And now as they marched\r\non, preserving no sort of battle order--on the supposition that the\r\nenemy had got far ahead of them into the district of Ephesus--suddenly\r\nthey caught sight of his scouts perched on some monumental structures\r\nfacing them. To send up scouts into similar edifices and towers on their\r\nown side was the work of a few moments, and before them lay revealed the\r\nlong lines of troops drawn up just where their road lay. These were the\r\nCarians, with their white shields, and the whole Persian troops there\r\npresent, with all the Hellenic contingents belonging to either satrap.\r\nBesides these there was a great cloud of cavalry: on the right wing the\r\nsquadrons of Tissaphernes, and on the left those of Pharnabazus.\r\n\r\nSeeing how matters lay, Dercylidas ordered the generals of brigade and\r\ncaptains to form into line as quickly as possible, eight deep, placing\r\nthe light infantry on the fringe of battle, with the cavalry--such\r\ncavalry, that is, and of such numerical strength, as he chanced to have.\r\nMeanwhile, as general, he sacrificed. (11) During this interval the\r\ntroops from Peloponnese kept quiet in preparation as for battle. Not\r\nso the troops from Priene and Achilleum, from the islands and the Ionic\r\ncities, some of whom left their arms in the corn, which stood thick and\r\ndeep in the plain of the Maeander, and took to their heels; while those\r\nwho remained at their posts gave evident signs that their steadiness\r\nwould not last. Pharnabazus, it was reported, had given orders to\r\nengage; but Tissaphernes, who recalled his experience of his own\r\nexploits with the Cyreian army, and assumed that all other Hellenes\r\nwere of similar mettle, had no desire to engage, but sent to Dercylidas\r\nsaying, he should be glad to meet him in conference. So Dercylidas,\r\nattended by the pick of his troops, horse and foot, in personal\r\nattendance on himself, (12) went forward to meet the envoys. He told\r\nthem that for his own part he had made his preparations to engage, as\r\nthey themselves might see, but still, if the satraps were minded to meet\r\nin conference, he had nothing to say against it--\"Only, in that case,\r\nthere must be mutual exchange of hostages and other pledges.\"\r\n\r\n (11) I.e. according to custom on the eve of battle. See \"Pol. Lac.\"\r\n    xiii. 8.\r\n\r\n (12) Lit. \"they were splendid fellows to look at.\" See \"Anab.\" II.\r\n    iii. 3.\r\n\r\nWhen this proposal had been agreed to and carried out, the two armies\r\nretired for the night--the Asiatics to Tralles in Caria, the Hellenes to\r\nLeucophrys, where was a temple (13) of Artemis of great sanctity, and\r\na sandy-bottomed lake more than a furlong in extent, fed by a spring of\r\never-flowing water fit for drinking and warm. For the moment so much was\r\neffected. On the next day they met at the place appointed, and it was\r\nagreed that they should mutually ascertain the terms on which either\r\nparty was willing to make peace. On his side, Dercylidas insisted\r\nthat the king should grant independence to the Hellenic cities; while\r\nTissaphernes and Pharnabazus demanded the evacuation of the country by\r\nthe Hellenic army, and the withdrawal of the Lacedaemonian governors\r\nfrom the cities. After this interchange of ideas a truce was entered\r\ninto, so as to allow time for the reports of the proceedings to be sent\r\nby Dercylidas to Lacedaemon, and by Tissaphernes to the king.\r\n\r\n (13) Lately unearthed. See \"Class. Rev.\" v. 8, p. 391.\r\n\r\nB.C. 401 (?). Whilst such was the conduct of affairs in Asia under the\r\nguidance of Dercylidas, the Lacedaemonians at home were at the same\r\ntime no less busily employed with other matters. They cherished a\r\nlong-standing embitterment against the Eleians, the grounds of which\r\nwere that the Eleians had once (14) contracted an alliance with the\r\nAthenians, Argives, and Mantineans; moreover, on pretence of a sentence\r\nregistered against the Lacedaemonians, they had excluded them from\r\nthe horse-race and gymnastic contests. Nor was that the sum of their\r\noffending. They had taken and scourged Lichas, (15) under the following\r\ncircumstances:--Being a Spartan, he had formally consigned his chariot\r\nto the Thebans, and when the Thebans were proclaimed victors he stepped\r\nforward to crown his charioteer; whereupon, in spite of his grey hairs,\r\nthe Eleians put those indignities upon him and expelled him from the\r\nfestival. Again, at a date subsequent to that occurrence, Agis being\r\nsent to offer sacrifice to Olympian Zeus in accordance with the bidding\r\nof an oracle, the Eleians would not suffer him to offer prayer for\r\nvictory in war, asserting that the ancient law and custom (16) forbade\r\nHellenes to consult the god for war with Hellenes; and Agis was forced\r\nto go away without offering the sacrifice.\r\n\r\n (14) In 421 B.C. (see Thuc. v. 31); for the second charge, see Thuc.\r\n    v. 49 foll.\r\n\r\n (15) See \"Mem.\" I. ii. 61; Thuc. v. 50; and Jowett, note ad loc. vol.\r\n    ii. p. 314.\r\n\r\n (16) See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 311 note.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all these annoyances the ephors and the Assembly\r\ndetermined \"to bring the men of Elis to their senses.\" Thereupon they\r\nsent an embassy to that state, announcing that the authorities of\r\nLacedaemon deemed it just and right that they should leave the country\r\n(17) townships in the territory of Elis free and independent. This the\r\nEleians flatly refused to do. The cities in question were theirs by\r\nright of war. Thereupon the ephors called out the ban. The leader of the\r\nexpedition was Agis. He invaded Elis through Achaia (18) by the Larisus;\r\nbut the army had hardly set foot on the enemy's soil and the work of\r\ndevastation begun, when an earthquake took place, and Agis, taking\r\nthis as a sign from Heaven, marched back again out of the country and\r\ndisbanded his army. Thereat the men of Elis were much more emboldened,\r\nand sent embassies to various cities which they knew to be hostile to\r\nthe Lacedaemonians.\r\n\r\n (17) Lit. \"perioecid.\"\r\n\r\n (18) From the north. The Larisus is the frontier stream between Achaia\r\n    and Elis. See Strabo, viii. 387.\r\n\r\nThe year had not completed its revolution (19) ere the ephors again\r\ncalled out the ban against Elis, and the invading host of Agis was this\r\ntime swelled by the rest of the allies, including the Athenians; the\r\nBoeotians and Corinthians alone excepted. The Spartan king now entered\r\nthrough Aulon, (20) and the men of Lepreum (21) at once revolted\r\nfrom the Eleians and gave in their adhesion to the Spartan, and\r\nsimultaneously with these the Macistians and their next-door neighbours\r\nthe Epitalians. As he crossed the river further adhesions followed, on\r\nthe part of the Letrinians, the Amphidolians, and the Marganians.\r\n\r\n (19) Al. \"on the coming round of the next year.\" See Jowett (note to\r\n    Thuc. i. 31), vol. ii. p. 33.\r\n\r\n (20) On the south. For the history, see Busolt, \"Die Laked.\" pp.\r\n    146-200. \"The river\" is the Alpheus.\r\n\r\n (21) See below, VI. v. 11; Paus. IV. xv. 8.\r\n\r\nB.C. 400 (?). Upon this he pushed on into Olympian territory and did\r\nsacrifice to Olympian Zeus. There was no attempt to stay his proceedings\r\nnow. After sacrifice he marched against the capital, (22) devastating\r\nand burning the country as he went. Multitudes of cattle, multitudes\r\nof slaves, were the fruits of conquest yielded, insomuch that the fame\r\nthereof spread, and many more Arcadians and Achaeans flocked to join\r\nthe standard of the invader and to share in the plunder. In fact, the\r\nexpedition became one enormous foray. Here was the chance to fill all\r\nthe granaries of Peloponnese with corn. When he had reached the capital,\r\nthe beautiful suburbs and gymnasia became a spoil to the troops; but the\r\ncity itself, though it lay open before him a defenceless and unwalled\r\ntown, he kept aloof from. He would not, rather than could not, take\r\nit. Such was the explanation given. Thus the country was a prey to\r\ndevastation, and the invaders massed round Cyllene.\r\n\r\n (22) I.e. Elis, of which Cyllene is the port town. For the wealth of\r\n    the district, see Polyb. iv. 73; and below, VII. iv. 33.\r\n\r\nThen the friends of a certain Xenias--a man of whom it was said that\r\nhe might measure the silver coin, inherited from his father, by the\r\nbushel--wishing to be the leading instrument in bringing over the state\r\nto Lacedaemon, rushed out of the house, sword in hand, and began a\r\nwork of butchery. Amongst other victims they killed a man who strongly\r\nresembled the leader of the democratic party, Thrasydaeus. (23) Everyone\r\nbelieved it was really Thrasydaeus who was slain. The popular party were\r\npanic-stricken, and stirred neither hand nor foot. On their side,\r\nthe cut-throats poured their armed bands into the market-place. But\r\nThrasydaeus was laid asleep the while where the fumes of wine had\r\noverpowered him. When the people came to discover that their hero was\r\nnot dead, they crowded round his house this side and that, (24) like a\r\nswarm of bees clinging to their leader; and as soon as Thrasydaeus\r\nhad put himself in the van, with the people at his back, a battle was\r\nfought, and the people won. And those who had laid their hands to deeds\r\nof butchery went as exiles to the Lacedaemonians.\r\n\r\n (23) See Paus. III. viii. 4. He was a friend of Lysias (\"Vit. X. Orat.\r\n    835\").\r\n\r\n (24) The house was filled to overflowing by the clustering close-\r\n    packed crowd.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Agis himself retired, recrossing the Alpheus; but he was\r\ncareful to leave a garrison in Epitalium near that river, with Lysippus\r\nas governor, and the exiles from Elis along with him. Having done so, he\r\ndisbanded his army and returned home himself.\r\n\r\nB.C. 400-399 (?). (25) During the rest of the summer and the ensuing\r\nwinter the territory of the Eleians was ravaged and ransacked by\r\nLysippus and his troops, until Thrasydaeus, the following summer, sent\r\nto Lacedaemon and agreed to dismantle the walls of Phea and Cyllene, and\r\nto grant autonomy to the Triphylian townships (26)--together with Phrixa\r\nand Epitalium, the Letrinians, Amphidolians, and Marganians; and besides\r\nthese to the Acroreians and to Lasion, a place claimed by the Arcadians.\r\nWith regard to Epeium, a town midway between Heraea and Macistus,\r\nthe Eleians claimed the right to keep it, on the plea that they had\r\npurchased the whole district from its then owners, for thirty talents,\r\n(27) which sum they had actually paid. But the Lacedaemonians, acting on\r\nthe principle \"that a purchase which forcibly deprives the weaker party\r\nof his possession is no more justifiable than a seizure by violence,\"\r\ncompelled them to emancipate Epeium also. From the presidency of the\r\ntemple of Olympian Zeus, however, they did not oust them; not that it\r\nbelonged to Elis of ancient right, but because the rival claimants,\r\n(28) it was felt, were \"villagers,\" hardly equal to the exercise of\r\nthe presidency. After these concessions, peace and alliance between the\r\nEleians and the Lacedaemonians were established, and the war between\r\nElis and Sparta ceased.\r\n\r\n (25) Grote (\"H. G.\" ix. 316) discusses the date of this war between\r\n    Elis and Sparta, which he thinks, reaches over three different\r\n    years, 402-400 B.C. But Curtius (vol. iv. Eng. tr. p. 196)\r\n    disagrees: \"The Eleian war must have occurred in 401-400 B.C., and\r\n    Grote rightly conjectures that the Eleians were anxious to bring\r\n    it to a close before the celebration of the festival. But he errs\r\n    in extending its duration over three years.\" See Diod. xiv. 17.\r\n    24; Paus. III. viii. 2 foll.\r\n\r\n (26) Grote remarks: \"There is something perplexing in Xenophon's\r\n    description of the Triphylian townships which the Eleians\r\n    surrendered\" (\"H. G.\" ix. 315). I adopt Grote's emend. {kai\r\n    Phrixan}. See Busolt, op. cit. p. 176.\r\n\r\n (27) = 7,312 pounds: 10 shillings.\r\n\r\n (28) I.e. the men of the Pisatid. See below, VII. iv. 28; Busolt, op.\r\n    cit. p 156.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAfter this Agis came to Delphi and offered as a sacrifice a tenth of the\r\nspoil. On his return journey he fell ill at Heraea--being by this time\r\nan old man--and was carried back to Lacedaemon. He survived the journey,\r\nbut being there arrived, death speedily overtook him. He was buried with\r\na sepulchre transcending in solemnity the lot of ordinary mortality. (1)\r\n\r\n (1) See \"Ages.\" xi. 16; \"Pol. Lac.\" xv. 9.\r\n\r\nWhen the holy days of mourning were accomplished, and it was necessary\r\nto choose another king, there were rival claimants to the throne.\r\nLeotychides claimed it as the son, Agesilaus as the brother, of Agis.\r\nThen Leotychides protested: \"Yet consider, Agesilaus, the law bids not\r\n'the king's brother,' but 'the king's son' to be king; only if there\r\nchance to be no son, in that case shall the brother of the king be\r\nking.\" Agesilaus: \"Then must I needs be king.\" Leotychides: \"How so,\r\nseeing that I am not dead?\" Agesilaus: \"Because he whom you call\r\nyour father denied you, saying, 'Leotychides is no son of mine.'\"\r\nLeotychides: \"Nay, but my mother, who would know far better than\r\nhe, said, and still to-day says, I am.\" Agesilaus: \"Nay, but the god\r\nhimself, Poteidan, laid his finger on thy falsity when by his earthquake\r\nhe drove forth thy father from the bridal chamber into the light of day;\r\nand time, 'that tells no lies,' as the proverb has it, bare witness to\r\nthe witness of the god; for just ten months from the moment at which he\r\nfled and was no more seen within that chamber, you were born.\" (2) So\r\nthey reasoned together.\r\n\r\n (2) I have followed Sauppe as usual, but see Hartman (\"Anal. Xen.\" p.\r\n    327) for a discussion of the whole passage. He thinks Xenophon\r\n    wrote {ex ou gar toi ephugen} ({o sos pater}, i.e. adulterer) {ek\r\n    to thalamo dekato meni tu ephus}. The Doric {ek to thalamo} was\r\n    corrupted into {en to thalamo} and {kai ephane} inserted. This\r\n    corrupt reading Plutarch had before him, and hence his distorted\r\n    version of the story.\r\n\r\nDiopethes, (3) a great authority upon oracles, supported Leotychides.\r\nThere was an oracle of Apollo, he urged, which said \"Beware of the lame\r\nreign.\" But Diopethes was met by Lysander, who in behalf of Agesilaus\r\ndemurred to this interpretation put upon the language of the god. If\r\nthey were to beware of a lame reign, it meant not, beware lest a man\r\nstumble and halt, but rather, beware of him in whose veins flows not the\r\nblood of Heracles; most assuredly the kingdom would halt, and that would\r\nbe a lame reign in very deed, whensoever the descendants of Heracles\r\nshould cease to lead the state. Such were the arguments on either side,\r\nafter hearing which the city chose Agesilaus to be king.\r\n\r\n (3) See Plut. \"Ages.\" ii. 4; \"Lys.\" xxii. (Clough, iv. 3; iii. 129);\r\n    Paus. III. viii. 5.\r\n\r\nNow Agesilaus had not been seated on the throne one year when, as he\r\nsacrificed one of the appointed sacrifices in behalf of the city, (4)\r\nthe soothsayer warned him, saying: \"The gods reveal a conspiracy of the\r\nmost fearful character\"; and when the king sacrificed a second time,\r\nhe said: \"The aspect of the victims is now even yet more terrible\"; but\r\nwhen he had sacrificed for the third time, the soothsayer exclaimed: \"O\r\nAgesilaus, the sign is given to me, even as though we were in the very\r\nmidst of the enemy.\" Thereupon they sacrificed to the deities who avert\r\nevil and work salvation, and so barely obtained good omens and ceased\r\nsacrificing. Nor had five days elapsed after the sacrifices were ended,\r\nere one came bringing information to the ephors of a conspiracy, and\r\nnamed Cinadon as the ringleader; a young man robust of body as of soul,\r\nbut not one of the peers. (5) Accordingly the ephors questioned their\r\ninformant: \"How say you the occurrence is to take place?\" and he who\r\ngave the information answered: \"Cinadon took me to the limit of the\r\nmarket-place, and bade me count how many Spartans there were in\r\nthe market-place; and I counted--'king, ephors, and elders, and\r\nothers--maybe forty. But tell me, Cinadon,' I said to him, 'why have you\r\nbidden me count them?' and he answered me: 'Those men, I would have\r\nyou know, are your sworn foes; and all those others, more than four\r\nthousand, congregated there are your natural allies.' Then he took and\r\nshowed me in the streets, here one and there two of 'our enemies,' as we\r\nchanced to come across them, and all the rest 'our natural allies'; and\r\nso again running through the list of Spartans to be found in the country\r\ndistricts, he still kept harping on that string: 'Look you, on each\r\nestate one foeman--the master--and all the rest allies.'\" The ephors\r\nasked: \"How many do you reckon are in the secret of this matter?\" The\r\ninformant answered: \"On that point also he gave me to understand that\r\nthere were by no means many in their secret who were prime movers of the\r\naffair, but those few to be depended on; 'and to make up,' said he,\r\n'we ourselves are in their secret, all the rest of them--helots,\r\nenfranchised, inferiors, provincials, one and all. (6) Note their\r\ndemeanour when Spartans chance to be the topic of their talk. Not one of\r\nthem can conceal the delight it would give him if he might eat up every\r\nSpartan raw.'\" (7) Then, as the inquiry went on, the question came: \"And\r\nwhere did they propose to find arms?\" The answer followed: \"He explained\r\nthat those of us, of course, who are enrolled in regiments have arms of\r\nour own already, and as for the mass--he led the way to the war\r\nfoundry, and showed me scores and scores of knives, of swords, of spits,\r\nhatchets, and axes, and reaping-hooks. 'Anything or everything,' he told\r\nme, 'which men use to delve in earth, cut timber, or quarry stone, would\r\nserve our purpose; nay, the instruments used for other arts would in\r\nnine cases out of ten furnish weapons enough and to spare, especially\r\nwhen dealing with unarmed antagonists.'\" Once more being asked what time\r\nthe affair was to come off, he replied his orders were \"not to leave the\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\n (4) \"Pol. Lac.\" xv. 2.\r\n\r\n (5) For the {omoioi}, see Muller, \"Dorians,\" iii. 5, 7 (vol. ii. p.\r\n    84); Grote, \"H.

(10) He had further instructions to capture another\r\nresident in Aulon; this was a woman, the fashionable beauty of the\r\nplace--supposed to be the arch-corruptress of all Lacedaemonians, young\r\nand old, who visited Aulon. It was not the first mission of the sort\r\non which Cinadon had been employed by the ephors. It was natural,\r\ntherefore, that the ephors should entrust him with the scytale on which\r\nthe names of the suspects were inscribed; and in answer to his inquiry\r\nwhich of the young men he was to take with him, they said: \"Go and order\r\nthe eldest of the Hippagretae (11) (or commanders of horse) to let you\r\nhave six or seven who chance to be there.\" But they had taken care to\r\nlet the commander know whom he was to send, and that those sent should\r\nalso know that their business was to capture Cinadon. Further, the\r\nauthorities instructed Cinadon that they would send three waggons\r\nto save bringing back his captives on foot--concealing as deeply as\r\npossible the fact that he, and he alone, was the object of the mission.\r\nTheir reason for not securing him in the city was that they did not\r\nreally know the extent of the mischief; and they wished, in the first\r\ninstance, to learn from Cinadon who his accomplices were before these\r\nlatter could discover they were informed against and effect their\r\nescape. His captors were to secure him first, and having learnt from\r\nhim the names of his confederates, to write them down and send them\r\nas quickly as possible to the ephors. The ephors, indeed, were so much\r\nconcerned about the whole occurrence that they further sent a company of\r\nhorse to assist their agents at Aulon. (12) As soon as the capture was\r\neffected, and one of the horsemen was back with the list of names taken\r\ndown on the information of Cinadon, they lost no time in apprehending\r\nthe soothsayer Tisamenus and the rest who were the principals in\r\nthe conspiracy. When Cinadon (13) himself was brought back and\r\ncross-examined, and had made a full confession of the whole plot, his\r\nplans, and his accomplices, they put to him one final question: \"What\r\nwas your object in undertaking this business?\" He answered: \"I wished to\r\nbe inferior to no man in Lacedaemon.\" Let that be as it might, his fate\r\nwas to be taken out forthwith in irons, just as he was, and to be placed\r\nwith his two hands and his neck in the collar, and so under scourge and\r\ngoad to be driven, himself and his accomplices, round the city. Thus\r\nupon the heads of those was visited the penalty of their offences.\r\n\r\n (8) \"And pointed to a well-concerted plan.\"\r\n\r\n (9) See Grote, \"H.

(1) It was after the incidents just recorded that a Syracusan\r\nnamed Herodas brought news to Lacedaemon. He had chanced to be in\r\nPhoenicia with a certain shipowner, and was struck by the number of\r\nPhoenician triremes which he observed, some coming into harbour from\r\nother ports, others already there with their ships' companies complete,\r\nwhile others again were still completing their equipments. Nor was it\r\nonly what he saw, but he had heard say further that there were to be\r\nthree hundred of these vessels all told; whereupon he had taken passage\r\non the first sailing ship bound for Hellas. He was in haste to lay this\r\ninformation before the Lacedaemonians, feeling sure that the king and\r\nTissaphernes were concerned in these preparations--though where the\r\nfleet was to act, or against whom, he would not venture to predict.\r\n\r\n (1) See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 353, for chronology, etc.\r\n\r\nThese reports threw the Lacedaemonians into a flutter of expectation and\r\nanxiety. They summoned a meeting of the allies, and began to deliberate\r\nas to what ought to be done. Lysander, convinced of the enormous\r\nsuperiority of the Hellenic navy, and with regard to land forces drawing\r\nan obvious inference from the exploits and final deliverance of the\r\ntroops with Cyrus, persuaded Agesilaus, to undertake a campaign into\r\nAsia, provided the authorities would furnish him with thirty Spartans,\r\ntwo thousand of the enfranchised, (2) and contingents of the allies\r\namounting to six thousand men. Apart from these calculations, Lysander\r\nhad a personal object: he wished to accompany the king himself, and by\r\nhis aid to re-establish the decarchies originally set up by himself in\r\nthe different cities, but at a later date expelled through the action\r\nof the ephors, who had issued a fiat re-establishing the old order of\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n (2) Technically, \"neodamodes.\"\r\n\r\nB.C. 396. To this offer on the part of Agesilaus to undertake such an\r\nexpedition the Lacedaemonians responded by presenting him with all\r\nhe asked for, and six months' provisions besides. When the hour of\r\ndeparture came he offered all such sacrifices as are necessary, and\r\nlastly those \"before crossing the border,\" (3) and so set out. This\r\ndone, he despatched to the several states (4) messengers with directions\r\nas to the numbers to be sent from each, and the points of rendezvous;\r\nbut for himself he was minded to go and do sacrifice at Aulis, even as\r\nAgamemnon had offered sacrifice in that place ere he set sail for\r\nTroy. But when he had reached the place and had begun to sacrifice, the\r\nBoeotarchs (5) being apprised of his design, sent a body of cavalry and\r\nbade him desist from further sacrificing; (6) and lighting upon victims\r\nalready offered, they hurled them from off the altars, scattering the\r\nfragments. Then Agesilaus, calling the gods to witness, got on board his\r\ntrireme in bitter indignation, and sailed away. Arrived at Geraestus, he\r\nthere collected as large a portion of his troops as possible, and with\r\nthe armada made sail for Ephesus.\r\n\r\n (3) \"Pol. Lac.\" xiii. 2 foll.\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"To the several cities he had already despatched messengers\r\n    with directions,\" etc.; see Paus. III. ix. 1-3.\r\n\r\n (5) See Freeman, \"Hist. of Federal Government,\" ch. iv. \"Constitution\r\n    of the Boeotian League,\" pp. 162, 163. The Boeotarchs, as\r\n    representatives of the several Boeotian cities, were the supreme\r\n    military commanders of the League, and, as it would appear, the\r\n    general administrators of Federal affairs. \"The Boeotarchs of\r\n    course command at Delion, but they also act as administrative\r\n    magistrates of the League by hindering Agesilaus from sacrificing\r\n    at Aulis.\"\r\n\r\n (6) Plut. \"Ages.\" vi.; \"Pelop.\" xxi. See Breitenb. op. cit. Praef. p.\r\n    xvi.; and below, III. v. 5; VI. iv. 23.\r\n\r\nWhen he had reached that city the first move was made by Tissaphernes,\r\nwho sent asking, \"With what purpose he was come thither?\" And the\r\nSpartan king made answer: \"With the intention that the cities in Asia\r\nshall be independent even as are the cities in our quarter of Hellas.\"\r\nIn answer to this Tissaphernes said: \"If you on your part choose to\r\nmake a truce whilst I send ambassadors to the king, I think you may well\r\narrange the matter, and sail back home again, if so you will.\" \"Willing\r\nenough should I be,\" replied Agesilaus, \"were I not persuaded that you\r\nare cheating me.\" \"Nay, but it is open to you,\" replied the satrap, \"to\r\nexact a surety for the execution of the terms... 'Provided always that\r\nyou, Tissaphernes, carry out what you say without deceit, we on our side\r\nwill abstain from injuring your dominion in any respect whatever\r\nduring the truce.'\" (7) Accordingly in the presence of three\r\ncommissioners--Herippidas, Dercylidas, and Megillus--Tissaphernes took\r\nan oath in the words prescribed: \"Verily and indeed, I will effect peace\r\nhonestly and without guile.\" To which the commissioners, on behalf\r\nof Agesilaus, swore a counter-oath: \"Verily and indeed, provided\r\nTissaphernes so acts, we on our side will observe the truce.\"\r\n\r\n (7) For this corrupt passage, see Hartman, \"Anal. Xen.\" p. 332; also\r\n    Otto Keller's critical edition of the \"Hellenica\" (Lips,\r\n    MDCCCLXXX.)\r\n\r\nTissaphernes at once gave the lie to what he had sworn. Instead of\r\nadhering to peace he sent up to demand a large army from the king, in\r\naddition to what he already had. But Agesilaus, though he was fully\r\nalive to these proceedings, adhered as rigidly as ever to the truce.\r\n\r\nTo keep quiet and enjoy leisure was his duty, in the exercise of which\r\nhe wore away the time at Ephesus. But in reference to the organisation\r\nof the several states it was a season of vehement constitutional\r\ndisturbance in the several cities; that is to say, there were neither\r\ndemocracies as in the old days of the Athenians, nor yet were there\r\ndecarchies as in the days of Lysander. But here was Lysander back again.\r\nEvery one recognised him, and flocked to him with petitions for one\r\nfavour or another, which he was to obtain for them from Agesilaus.\r\nA crowd of suitors danced attendance on his heels, and formed so\r\nconspicuous a retinue that Agesilaus, any one would have supposed, was\r\nthe private person and Lysander the king. All this was maddening\r\nto Agesilaus, as was presently plain. As to the rest of the Thirty,\r\njealousy did not suffer them to keep silence, and they put it plainly to\r\nAgesilaus that the super-regal splendour in which Lysander lived was\r\na violation of the constitution. So when Lysander took upon himself to\r\nintroduce some of his petitioners to Agesilaus, the latter turned them\r\na deaf ear. Their being aided and abetted by Lysander was sufficient; he\r\nsent them away discomfited. At length, as time after time things turned\r\nout contrary to his wishes, Lysander himself perceived the position of\r\naffairs. He now no longer suffered that crowd to follow him, and gave\r\nthose who asked him help in anything plainly to understand that they\r\nwould gain nothing, but rather be losers, by his intervention. But being\r\nbitterly annoyed at the degradation put upon him, he came to the king\r\nand said to him: \"Ah, Agesilaus, how well you know the art of humbling\r\nyour friends!\" \"Ay, indeed,\" the king replied; \"those of them whose one\r\nidea it is to appear greater than myself; if I did not know how also to\r\nrequite with honour those who work for my good, I should be ashamed.\"\r\nAnd Lysander said: \"maybe there is more reason in your doings than ever\r\nguided my conduct;\" adding, \"Grant me for the rest one favour, so shall\r\nI cease to blush at the loss of my influence with you, and you will\r\ncease to be embarrassed by my presence. Send me off on a mission\r\nsomewhere; wherever I am I will strive to be of service to you.\" Such\r\nwas the proposal of Lysander. Agesilaus resolved to act upon it, and\r\ndespatched Lysander to the Hellespont. And this is what befell.\r\n(8) Lysander, being made aware of a slight which had been put upon\r\nSpithridates the Persian by Pharnabazus, got into conversation with the\r\ninjured man, and so worked upon him that he was persuaded to bring\r\nhis children and his personal belongings, and with a couple of hundred\r\ntroops to revolt. The next step was to deposit all the goods safely in\r\nCyzicus, and the last to get on shipboard with Spithridates and his\r\nson, and so to present himself with his Persian friends to Agesilaus.\r\nAgesilaus, on his side, was delighted at the transaction, and set\r\nhimself at once to get information about Pharnabazus, his territory and\r\nhis government.\r\n\r\n (8) See \"Ages.\" iii. 3; \"Anab.\" VI. v. 7.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tissaphernes had waxed bolder. A large body of troops had been\r\nsent down by the king. On the strength of that he declared war against\r\nAgesilaus, if he did not instantly withdraw his troops from Asia. The\r\nLacedaemonians there (9) present, no less than the allies, received the\r\nnews with profound vexation, persuaded as they were that Agesilaus had\r\nno force capable of competing with the king's grand armament. But a\r\nsmile lit up the face of Agesilaus as he bade the ambassadors return to\r\nTissaphernes and tell him that he was much in his debt for the perjury\r\nby which he had won the enmity of Heaven and made the very gods\r\nthemselves allies of Hellas. He at once issued a general order to the\r\ntroops to equip themselves for a forward movement. He warned the cities\r\nthrough which he must pass in an advance upon Caria, to have markets in\r\nreadiness, and lastly, he despatched a message to the Ionian, Aeolian,\r\nand Hellespontine communities to send their contingents to join him at\r\nEphesus.\r\n\r\n (9) I.e. at Ephesus.\r\n\r\nTissaphernes, putting together the facts that Agesilaus had no cavalry\r\nand that Caria was a region unadapted to that arm, and persuaded in\r\nhis own mind also that the Spartan could not but cherish wrath against\r\nhimself personally for his chicanery, felt convinced that he was really\r\nintending to invade Caria, and that the satrap's palace was his final\r\ngoal. Accordingly he transferred the whole of his infantry to that\r\nprovince, and proceeded to lead his cavalry round into the plain of the\r\nMaeander. Here he conceived himself capable of trampling the Hellenes\r\nunder foot with his horsemen before they could reach the craggy\r\ndistricts where no cavalry could operate.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of marching straight into Caria, Agesilaus turned sharp\r\noff in the opposite direction towards Phrygia. Picking up various\r\ndetachments of troops which met him on his march, he steadily advanced,\r\nlaying cities prostrate before him, and by the unexpectedness of his\r\nattack reaping a golden harvest of spoil. As a rule the march was\r\nprosecuted safely; but not far from Dascylium his advanced guard of\r\ncavalry were pushing on towards a knoll to take a survey of the state\r\nof things in front, when, as chance would have it, a detachment of\r\ncavalry sent forward by Pharnabazus--the corps, in fact, of Rhathines\r\nand his natural brother Bagaeus--just about equal to the Hellenes in\r\nnumber, also came galloping up to the very knoll in question. The two\r\nbodies found themselves face to face not one hundred and fifty yards\r\n(10) apart, and for the first moment or two stood stock still. The\r\nHellenic horse were drawn up like an ordinary phalanx four deep, the\r\nbarbarians presenting a narrow front of twelve or thereabouts, and a\r\nvery disproportionate depth. There was a moment's pause, and then the\r\nbarbarians, taking the initiative, charged. There was a hand-to-hand\r\ntussle, in which any Hellene who succeeded in striking his man shivered\r\nhis lance with the blow, while the Persian troopers, armed with\r\ncornel-wood javelins, speedily despatched a dozen men and a couple of\r\nhorses. (11) At this point the Hellenic cavalry turned and fled. But as\r\nAgesilaus came up to the rescue with his heavy infantry, the Asiatics\r\nwere forced in their turn to withdraw, with the loss of one man slain.\r\nThis cavalry engagement gave them pause. Agesilaus on the day following\r\nit offered sacrifice. \"Was he to continue his advance?\" But the victims\r\nproved hopeless. (12) There was nothing for it after this manifestation\r\nbut to turn and march towards the sea. It was clear enough to his mind\r\nthat without a proper cavalry force it would be impossible to conduct\r\na campaign in the flat country. Cavalry, therefore, he must get, or be\r\ndriven to mere guerilla warfare. With this view he drew up a list of\r\nall the wealthiest inhabitants belonging to the several cities of\r\nthose parts. Their duty would be to support a body of cavalry, with the\r\nproviso, however, that any one contributing a horse, arms, and rider, up\r\nto the standard, would be exempted from personal service. The effect\r\nwas instantaneous. The zeal with which the recipients of these orders\r\nresponded could hardly have been greater if they had been seeking\r\nsubstitutes to die for them.\r\n\r\n (10) Lit. \"four plethra.\"\r\n\r\n (11) See Xenophon's treatise \"On Horsemanship,\" xii. 12.\r\n\r\n (12) Lit. \"lobeless,\" i.e. with a lobe of the liver wanting--a bad\r\n    sign.\r\n\r\nB.C. 395. After this, at the first indication of spring, he collected\r\nthe whole of his army at Ephesus. But the army needed training. With\r\nthat object he proposed a series of prizes--prizes to the heavy infantry\r\nregiments, to be won by those who presented their men in the best\r\ncondition; prizes for the cavalry regiments which could ride best;\r\nprizes for those divisions of peltasts and archers which proved most\r\nefficient in their respective duties. And now the gymnasiums were\r\na sight to see, thronged as they were, one and all, with warriors\r\nstripping for exercise; or again, the hippodrome crowded with horses and\r\nriders performing their evolutions; or the javelin men and archers\r\ngoing through their peculiar drill. In fact, the whole city where he\r\nlay presented under his hands a spectacle not to be forgotten. The\r\nmarket-place literally teemed with horses, arms, and accoutrements of\r\nall sorts for sale. The bronze-worker, the carpenter, the smith, the\r\nleather-cutter, the painter and embosser, were all busily engaged in\r\nfabricating the implements of war; so that the city of Ephesus itself\r\nwas fairly converted into a military workshop. (13) It would have done\r\na man's heart good to see those long lines of soldiers with Agesilaus\r\nat their head, as they stepped gaily be-garlanded from the gymnasiums to\r\ndedicate their wreaths to the goddess Artemis. Nor can I well conceive\r\nof elements more fraught with hope than were here combined. Here were\r\nreverence and piety towards Heaven; here practice in war and military\r\ntraining; here discipline with habitual obedience to authority. But\r\ncontempt for one's enemy will infuse a kind of strength in battle. So\r\nthe Spartan leader argued; and with a view to its production he ordered\r\nthe quartermasters to put up the prisoners who had been captured by\r\nhis foraging bands for auction, stripped naked; so that his Hellenic\r\nsoldiery, as they looked at the white skins which had never been bared\r\nto sun and wind, the soft limbs unused to toil through constant riding\r\nin carriages, came to the conclusion that war with such adversaries\r\nwould differ little from a fight with women.\r\n\r\n (13) See Plut. \"Marc.\" (Clough, ii. 262); Polyb. \"Hist.\" x. 20.\r\n\r\nBy this date a full year had elapsed since the embarkation of Agesilaus,\r\nand the time had come for the Thirty with Lysander to sail back home,\r\nand for their successors, with Herippidas, to arrive. Among these\r\nAgesilaus appointed Xenocles and another to the command of the cavalry,\r\nScythes to that of the heavy infantry of the enfranchised, (14)\r\nHerippidas to that of the Cyreians, and Migdon to that of the\r\ncontingents from the states. Agesilaus gave them to understand that he\r\nintended to lead them forthwith by the most expeditious route against\r\nthe stronghold of the country, (15) so that without further ceremony\r\nthey might prepare their minds and bodies for the tug of battle.\r\nTissaphernes, however, was firmly persuaded that this was only talk\r\nintended to deceive him; Agesilaus would this time certainly invade\r\nCaria. Accordingly he repeated his former tactics, transporting his\r\ninfantry bodily into Caria and posting his cavalry in the valley of the\r\nMaeander. But Agesilaus was as good as his word, and at once invaded the\r\ndistrict of Sardis. A three days' march through a region denuded of the\r\nenemy threw large supplies into his hands. On the fourth day the cavalry\r\nof the enemy approached. Their general ordered the officer in charge of\r\nhis baggage-train to cross the Pactolus and encamp, while his troopers,\r\ncatching sight of stragglers from the Hellenic force scattered in\r\npursuit of booty, put several of them to the sword. Perceiving which,\r\nAgesilaus ordered his cavalry to the rescue; and the Persians on their\r\nside, seeing their advance, collected together in battle order to\r\nreceive them, with dense squadrons of horse, troop upon troop. The\r\nSpartan, reflecting that the enemy had as yet no infantry to support\r\nhim, whilst he had all branches of the service to depend upon, concluded\r\nthat the critical moment had arrived at which to risk an engagement.\r\nIn this mood he sacrificed, and began advancing his main line of battle\r\nagainst the serried lines of cavalry in front of him, at the same time\r\nordering the flower of his heavy infantry--the ten-years-service men\r\n(16)--to close with them at a run, and the peltasts to bring up their\r\nsupports at the double. The order passed to his cavalry was to charge\r\nin confidence that he and the whole body of his troops were close behind\r\nthem. The cavalry charge was received by the Persians without flinching,\r\nbut presently finding themselves environed by the full tide of war they\r\nswerved. Some found a speedy grave within the river, but the mass of\r\nthem gradually made good their escape. The Hellenes followed close on\r\nthe heels of the flying foe and captured his camp. here the peltasts not\r\nunnaturally fell to pillaging; whereupon Agesilaus planted his troops\r\nso as to form a cordon enclosing the property of friends and foes alike.\r\nThe spoil taken was considerable; it fetched more than seventy talents,\r\n(17) not to mention the famous camels, subsequently brought over by\r\nAgesilaus into Hellas, which were captured here. At the moment of the\r\nbattle Tissaphernes lay in Sardis. Hence the Persians argued that they\r\nhad been betrayed by the satrap. And the king of Persia, coming to a\r\nlike conclusion himself that Tissaphernes was to blame for the evil turn\r\nof his affairs, sent down Tithraustes and beheaded him. (18)\r\n\r\n (14) The neodamodes.\r\n\r\n (15) I.e. Lydia. See Plut. \"Ages.\" x. (Clough, iv. 11).\r\n\r\n (16) See note to \"Hell.\" II. iv. 32.\r\n\r\n (17) = 17,062 pounds: 10 shillings.\r\n\r\n (18) See Diod. xiv. 80.\r\n\r\nThis done, Tithraustes sent an embassy to Agesilaus with a message as\r\nfollows: \"The author of all our trouble, yours and ours, Agesilaus, has\r\npaid the penalty of his misdoings; the king therefore asks of you first\r\nthat you should sail back home in peace; secondly, that the cities in\r\nAsia secured in their autonomy should continue to render him the ancient\r\ntribute.\" To this proposition Agesilaus made answer that \"without the\r\nauthorities at home he could do nothing in the matter.\" \"Then do you,\r\nat least,\" replied Tithraustes, \"while awaiting advice from Lacedaemon,\r\nwithdraw into the territory of Pharnabazus. Have I not avenged you of\r\nyour enemy?\" \"While, then, I am on my way thither,\" rejoined Agesilaus,\r\n\"will you support my army with provisions?\" On this wise Tithraustes\r\nhanded him thirty talents, (19) which the other took, and forthwith\r\nbegan his march into Phrygia (the Phrygia of Pharnabazus). He lay in the\r\nplain district above Cyme, (20) when a message reached him from the home\r\nauthorities, giving him absolute disposal of the naval forces, (21)\r\nwith the right to appoint the admiral of his choice. This course the\r\nLacedaemonians were led to adopt by the following considerations: If,\r\nthey argued, the same man were in command of both services, the land\r\nforce would be greatly strengthened through the concentration of the\r\ndouble force at any point necessary; and the navy likewise would be far\r\nmore useful through the immediate presence and co-operation of the land\r\nforce where needed. Apprised of these measures, Agesilaus in the first\r\ninstance sent an order to the cities on the islands and the seaboard to\r\nfit out as many ships of war as they severally might deem desirable.\r\nThe result was a new navy, consisting of the vessels thus voluntarily\r\nfurnished by the states, with others presented by private persons out\r\nof courtesy to their commander, and amounting in all to a fleet of one\r\nhundred and twenty sail. The admiral whom he selected was Peisander, his\r\nwife's brother, a man of genuine ambition and of a vigorous spirit, but\r\nnot sufficiently expert in the details of equipment to achieve a great\r\nnaval success. Thus while Peisander set off to attend to naval matters,\r\nAgesilaus continued his march whither he was bound to Phrygia.\r\n\r\n (19) = 7,312 pounds: 10 shillings.\r\n\r\n (20) See \"Cyrop.\" VII. i. 45.\r\n\r\n (21) See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 327, note 3; Arist. \"Pol.\" ii. 9, 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBut now Tithraustes seemed to have discovered in Agesilaus a disposition\r\nto despise the fortunes of the Persian monarch--he evidently had no\r\nintention to withdraw from Asia; on the contrary, he was cherishing\r\nhopes vast enough to include the capture of the king himself. Being at\r\nhis wits' end how to manage matters, he resolved to send Timocrates the\r\nRhodian to Hellas with a gift of gold worthy fifty silver talents, (1)\r\nand enjoined upon him to endeavour to exchange solemn pledges with\r\nthe leading men in the several states, binding them to undertake a\r\nwar against Lacedaemon. Timocrates arrived and began to dole out\r\nhis presents. In Thebes he gave gifts to Androcleidas, Ismenias, and\r\nGalaxidorus; in Corinth to Timolaus and Polyanthes; in Argos to Cylon\r\nand his party. The Athenians, (2) though they took no share of the gold,\r\nwere none the less eager for the war, being of opinion that empire\r\nwas theirs by right. (3) The recipients of the moneys forthwith began\r\ncovertly to attack the Lacedaemonians in their respective states, and,\r\nwhen they had brought these to a sufficient pitch of hatred, bound\r\ntogether the most important of them in a confederacy.\r\n\r\n (1) = 12,187 pounds: 10 shillings.\r\n\r\n (2) See Paus. III. ix. 8; Plut. \"Ages.\" xv.\r\n\r\n (3) Reading {nomizontes auton to arkhein} with Sauppe; or if, as\r\n    Breitinbach suggests, {enomizon de oukh outon to arkhesthai},\r\n    translate \"but thought it was not for them to take the\r\n    initiative.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was clear to the leaders in Thebes that, unless some one struck\r\nthe first blow, the Lacedaemonians would never be brought to break the\r\ntruce with their allies. They therefore persuaded the Opuntian Locrians\r\n(4) to levy moneys on a debatable district, (5) jointly claimed by the\r\nPhocians and themselves, when the Phocians would be sure to retaliate\r\nby an attack on Locris. These expectations were fulfilled. The Phocians\r\nimmediately invaded Locris and seized moneys on their side with ample\r\ninterest. Then Androcleidas and his friends lost no time in persuading\r\nthe Thebans to assist the Locrians, on the ground that it was no\r\ndebatable district which had been entered by the Phocians, but\r\nthe admittedly friendly and allied territory of Locris itself. The\r\ncounter-invasion of Phocis and pillage of their country by the Thebans\r\npromptly induced the Phocians to send an embassy to Lacedaemon. In\r\nclaiming assistance they explained that the war was not of their own\r\nseeking, but that they had attacked the Locrians in self-defence. On\r\ntheir side the Lacedaemonians were glad enough to seize a pretext for\r\nmarching upon the Thebans, against whom they cherished a long-standing\r\nbitterness. They had not forgotten the claim which the Thebans had\r\nset up to a tithe for Apollo in Deceleia, (6) nor yet their refusal to\r\nsupport Lacedaemon in the attack on Piraeus; (7) and they accused them\r\nfurther of having persuaded the Corinthians not to join that expedition.\r\nNor did they fail to call to mind some later proceedings of the\r\nThebans--their refusal to allow Agesilaus to sacrifice in Aulis; (8)\r\ntheir snatching the victims already offered and hurling them from the\r\naltars; their refusal to join the same general in a campaign directed\r\neven against Asia. (9) The Lacedaemonians further reasoned that now,\r\nif ever, was the favourable moment to conduct an expedition against\r\nthe Thebans, and once for all to put a stop to their insolent behaviour\r\ntowards them. Affairs in Asia were prospering under the strong arm of\r\nAgesilaus, and in Hellas they had no other war on hand to trammel their\r\nmovements. Such, therefore, being the general view of the situation\r\nadopted at Lacedaemon, the ephors proceeded to call out the ban.\r\nMeanwhile they despatched Lysander to Phocis with orders to put himself\r\nat the head of the Phocians along with the Oetaeans, Heracleotes,\r\nMelians, and Aenianians, and to march upon Haliartus; before the\r\nwalls of which place Pausanias, the destined leader of the expedition,\r\nundertook to present himself at the head of the Lacedaemonians and other\r\nPeloponnesian forces by a specified date. Lysander not only carried\r\nout his instructions to the letter, but going a little beyond them,\r\nsucceeded in detaching Orchomenus from Thebes. (10) Pausanias, on\r\nthe other hand, after finding the sacrifice for crossing the frontier\r\nfavourable, sat down at Tegea and set about despatching to and fro the\r\ncommandants of allied troops whilst contentedly awaiting the soldiers\r\nfrom the provincial (11) districts of Laconia.\r\n\r\n (4) For an alliance between Athens and the Locrians, B.C. 395, see\r\n    Hicks, 67; and below, IV. ii. 17.\r\n\r\n (5) Lit. \"the.\" See Paus.

It was the\r\nutterance merely of one man, (13) who was at that time seated in\r\nthe congress of the allies. A more important fact is that when the\r\nLacedaemonians summoned us to attack Piraeus (14) the collective state\r\nof Thebes passed a resolution refusing to join in the campaign. As\r\nthen you are to a large extent the cause of the resentment which the\r\nLacedaemonians feel towards us, we consider it only fair that you in\r\nyour turn should render us assistance. Still more do we demand of you,\r\nsirs, who were of the city party at that date, to enter heart and soul\r\ninto war with the Lacedaemonians. For what were their services to you?\r\nThey first deliberately converted you into an oligarchy and placed you\r\nin hostility to the democracy, and then they came with a great force\r\nunder guise of being your allies, and delivered you over to the\r\nmajority, so that, for any service they rendered you, you were all dead\r\nmen; and you owe your lives to our friends here, the people of Athens.\r\n(15)\r\n\r\n (12) See \"Hell.\" II. ii. 19; and below, VI. v. 35.\r\n\r\n (13) Plut. \"Lys.\" xv. \"Erianthus the Theban gave his vote to pull down\r\n    the city, and turn the country into sheep-pasture.\"--Clough, iii.\r\n    121.\r\n\r\n (14) See \"Hell.\" II. iv. 30.\r\n\r\n (15) See \"Hell.\" II. iv. 38, 40, 41.\r\n\r\n\"But to pass on--we all know, men of Athens, that you would like to\r\nrecover the empire which you formerly possessed; and how can you compass\r\nyour object better than by coming to the aid yourselves of the victims\r\nof Lacedaemonian injustice? Is it their wide empire of which you are\r\nafraid? Let not that make cowards of you--much rather let it embolden\r\nyou as you lay to heart and ponder your own case. When your empire was\r\nwidest then the crop of your enemies was thickest. Only so long as they\r\nfound no opportunity to revolt did they keep their hatred of you dark;\r\nbut no sooner had they found a champion in Lacedaemon than they at once\r\nshowed what they really felt towards you. So too to-day. Let us show\r\nplainly that we mean to stand shoulder to shoulder (16) embattled\r\nagainst the Lacedaemonians; and haters enough of them--whole\r\narmies--never fear, will be forthcoming. To prove the truth of this\r\nassertion you need only to count upon your fingers. How many friends\r\nhave they left to them to-day? The Argives have been, are, and ever will\r\nbe, hostile to them. Of course. But the Eleians? Why, the Eleians have\r\nquite lately (17) been robbed of so much territory and so many cities\r\nthat their friendship is converted into hatred. And what shall we say\r\nof the Corinthians? the Arcadians? the Achaeans? In the war which Sparta\r\nwaged against you, there was no toil, no danger, no expense, which those\r\npeoples did not share, in obedience to the dulcet coaxings (18) and\r\npersuasions of that power. The Lacedaemonians gained what they wanted,\r\nand then not one fractional portion of empire, honour, or wealth did\r\nthese faithful followers come in for. That is not all. They have no\r\nscruple in appointing their helots (19) as governors, and on the free\r\nnecks of their alies, in the day of their good fortune, they have\r\nplanted the tyrant's heel.\r\n\r\n (16) Lit. \"shield to shield.\"\r\n\r\n (17) Lit. \"to-day,\" \"nowadays.\"\r\n\r\n (18) {mala liparoumenoi}. See Thuc. i. 66 foll.; vi. 88.\r\n\r\n (19) See \"Pol. Lac.\" xiv.\r\n\r\n\"Then again take the case of those whom they have detached from\r\nyourselves. In the most patent way they have cajoled and cheated them;\r\nin place of freedom they have presented them with a twofold slavery. The\r\nallies are tyrannised over by the governor and tyrannised over by the\r\nten commissioners set up by Lysander over every city. (20) And to come\r\nlastly to the great king. In spite of all the enormous contributions\r\nwith which he aided them to gain a mastery over you, is the lord of Asia\r\none whit better off to-day than if he had taken exactly the opposite\r\ncourse and joined you in reducing them?\r\n\r\n (20) Grote (\"H. G.\" ix. 323), referring to this passage, and to\r\n    \"Hell.\" VI. iii. 8-11, notes the change in Spartan habits between\r\n    405 and 394 B.C. (i.e. between the victory of Aegospotami and the\r\n    defeat of Cnidos), when Sparta possessed a large public revenue\r\n    derived from the tribute of the dependent cities. For her earlier\r\n    condition, 432 B.C., cf. Thuc. i. 80. For her subsequent\r\n    condition, 334 B.C., cf. Arist. \"Pol.\" ii. 6, 23.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not clear that you have only to step forward once again as the\r\nchampions of this crowd of sufferers from injustice, and you will attain\r\nto a pinnacle of power quite unprecedented? In the days of your old\r\nempire you were leaders of the maritime powers merely--that is clear;\r\nbut your new empire to-day will be universal. You will have at\r\nyour backs not only your former subjects, but ourselves, and the\r\nPeloponnesians, and the king himself, with all that mighty power\r\nwhich is his. We do not deny that we were serviceable allies enough to\r\nLacedaemon, as you will bear us witness; but this we say:--If we helped\r\nthe Lacedaemonians vigorously in the past, everything tends to show that\r\nwe shall help you still more vigorously to-day; for our swords will be\r\nunsheathed, not in behalf of islanders, or Syracusans, or men of alien\r\nstock, as happened in the late war, but of ourselves, suffering under a\r\nsense of wrong. And there is another important fact which you ought to\r\nrealise: this selfish system of organised greed which is Sparta's will\r\nfall more readily to pieces than your own late empire. Yours was the\r\nproud assertion of naval empire over subjects powerless by sea. Theirs\r\nis the selfish sway of a minority asserting dominion over states equally\r\nwell armed with themselves, and many times more numerous. Here our\r\nremarks end. Do not forget, however, men of Athens, that as far as we\r\ncan understand the matter, the field to which we invite you is destined\r\nto prove far richer in blessings to your own state of Athens than to\r\nours, Thebes.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the speaker ended. Among the Athenians, speaker after\r\nspeaker spoke in favour of the proposition, (21) and finally a unanimous\r\nresolution was passed voting assistance to the Thebans. Thrasybulus, in\r\nan answer communicating the resolution, pointed out with pride that in\r\nspite of the unfortified condition of Piraeus, Athens would not shrink\r\nfrom repaying her former debt of gratitude to Thebes with interest.\r\n\"You,\" he added, \"refused to join in a campaign against us; we are\r\nprepared to fight your battles with you against the enemy, if he attacks\r\nyou.\" Thus the Thebans returned home and made preparations to defend\r\nthemselves, whilst the Athenians made ready to assist them.\r\n\r\n (21) For the alliance between Boeotia and Athens, B.C. 395, see\r\n    Kohler, \"C. I. A.\" ii. 6; Hicks, op. cit. 65; Lys. \"pro Man.\" S.\r\n    13; Jebb, \"Att. Or.\" i. p. 247; and the two speeches of the same\r\n    orator Lysias against Alcibiades (son of the famous Alcibiades),\r\n    on a Charge of Desertion (\"Or.\" xiv.), and on a Charge of Failure\r\n    to Serve (\"Or.\" xv.)--Jebb, op. cit. i. p. 256 foll.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Lacedaemonians no longer hesitated. Pausanias the\r\nking advanced into Boeotia with the home army and the whole of the\r\nPeloponnesian contingents, saving only the Corinthians, who declined\r\nto serve. Lysander, at the head of the army supplied by Phocis and\r\nOrchomenus and the other strong places in those parts, had already\r\nreached Haliartus, in front of Pausanias. Being arrived, he refused to\r\nsit down quietly and await the arrival of the army from Lacedaemon, but\r\nat once marched with what troops he had against the walls of Haliartus;\r\nand in the first instance he tried to persuade the citizens to detach\r\nthemselves from Thebes and to assume autonomy, but the intention was\r\ncut short by certain Thebans within the fortress. Whereupon Lysander\r\nattacked the place. The Thebans were made aware, (22) and hurried to the\r\nrescue with heavy infantry and cavalry. Then, whether it was that the\r\narmy of relief fell upon Lysander unawares, or that with clear knowledge\r\nof his approach he preferred to await the enemy, with intent to crush\r\nhim, is uncertain. This only is clear: a battle was fought beside the\r\nwalls, and a trophy still exists to mark the victory of the townsfolk\r\nbefore the gates of Haliartus. Lysander was slain, and the rest fled to\r\nthe mountains, the Thebans hotly pursuing. But when the pursuit had led\r\nthem to some considerable height, and they were fairly environed and\r\nhemmed in by difficult ground and narrow space, then the heavy infantry\r\nturned to bay, and greeted them with a shower of darts and missiles.\r\nFirst two or three men dropped who had been foremost of the pursuers,\r\nand then upon the rest they poured volleys of stones down the\r\nprecipitous incline, and pressed on their late pursuers with much zeal,\r\nuntil the Thebans turned tail and quitted the deadly slope, leaving\r\nbehind them more than a couple of hundred corpses.\r\n\r\n (22) See Plut. \"Lys.\" xxviii. (Clough, iii. 137).\r\n\r\nOn this day, thereafter, the hearts of the Thebans failed them as they\r\ncounted their losses and found them equal to their gains; but the next\r\nday they discovered that during the night the Phocians and the rest of\r\nthem had made off to their several homes, whereupon they fell to pluming\r\nthemselves highly on their achievement. But presently Pausanias appeared\r\nat the head of the Lacedaemonian army, and once more their dangers\r\nseemed to thicken round them. Deep, we are told, was the silence and\r\nabasement which reigned in their host. It was not until the third day,\r\nwhen the Athenians arrived (23) and were duely drawn up beside them,\r\nwhilst Pausanias neither attacked nor offered battle, that at length the\r\nconfidence of the Thebans took a larger range. Pausanias, on his side,\r\nhaving summoned his generals and commanders of fifties, (24) deliberated\r\nwhether to give battle or to content himself with picking up the bodies\r\nof Lysander and those who fell with him, under cover of a truce.\r\n\r\n (23) See Dem. \"On the Crown,\" 258.\r\n\r\n (24) Lit. \"polemarchs and penteconters\"--\"colonels and lieutenants.\"\r\n    See \"Pol. Lac.\" xi.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which weighed upon the minds of Pausanias and\r\nthe other high officers of the Lacedaemonians seem to have been that\r\nLysander was dead and his defeated army in retreat; while, as far as\r\nthey themselves were concerned, the Corinthian contingent was absolutely\r\nwanting, and the zeal of the troops there present at the lowest ebb.\r\nThey further reasoned that the enemy's cavalry was numerous and theirs\r\nthe reverse; whilst, weightiest of all, there lay the dead right under\r\nthe walls, so that if they had been ever so much stronger it would have\r\nbeen no easy task to pick up the bodies within range of the towers of\r\nHaliartus. On all these grounds they determined to ask for a flag of\r\ntruce, in order to pick up the bodies of the slain. These, however, the\r\nThebans were not disposed to give back unless they agreed to retire from\r\ntheir territory. The terms were gladly accepted by the Lacedaemonians,\r\nwho at once picked up the corpses of the slain, and prepared to quit the\r\nterritory of Boeotia. The preliminaries were transacted, and the retreat\r\ncommenced. Despondent indeed was the demeanour of the Lacedaemonians,\r\nin contrast with the insolent bearing of the Thebans, who visited the\r\nslightest attempt to trespass on their private estates with blows and\r\nchased the offenders back on to the high roads unflinchingly. Such was\r\nthe conclusion of the campaign of the Lacedaemonians.\r\n\r\nAs for Pausanias, on his arrival at home he was tried on the capital\r\ncharge. The heads of indictment set forth that he had failed to reach\r\nHaliartus as soon as Lysander, in spite of his undertaking to be there\r\non the same day: that, instead of using any endeavour to pick up the\r\nbodies of the slain by force of arms, he had asked for a flag of truce:\r\nthat at an earlier date, when he had got the popular government of\r\nAthens fairly in his grip at Piraeus, he had suffered it to slip through\r\nhis fingers and escape. Besides this, (25) he failed to present himself\r\nat the trial, and a sentence of death was passed upon him. He escaped\r\nto Tegea and there died of an illness whilst still in exile. Thus closes\r\nthe chapter of events enacted on the soil of Hellas. To return to Asia\r\nand Agesilaus.\r\n\r\n (25) Or, add, \"as a further gravamen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nB.C. 395. With the fall of the year Agesilaus reached Phrygia--the\r\nPhrygia of Pharnabazus--and proceeded to burn and harry the district.\r\nCity after city was taken, some by force and some by voluntary\r\nsurrender. To a proposal of Spithridates to lead him into Paphlagonia,\r\n(1) where he would introduce the king of the country to him in\r\nconference and obtain his alliance, he readily acceded. It was a\r\nlong-cherished ambition of Agesilaus to alienate some one of the subject\r\nnations from the Persian monarch, and he pushed forward eagerly.\r\n\r\n (1) See Hartman (\"An. Xen.\" p. 339), who suggests {Otun auto} for {sun\r\n    auto}.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Paphlagonia, King Otys (2) came, and an alliance was\r\nmade. (The fact was, he had been summoned by the king to Susa and had\r\nnot gone up.) More than that, through the persuasion of Spithridates he\r\nleft behind as a parting gift to Agesilaus one thousand cavalry and a\r\ncouple of thousand peltasts. Agesilaus was anxious in some way to\r\nshow his gratitude to Spithridates for such help, and spoke as\r\nfollows:--\"Tell me,\" he said to Spithridates, \"would you not like to\r\ngive your daughter to King Otys?\" \"Much more would I like to give her,\"\r\nhe answered, \"than he to take her--I an outcast wanderer, and he lord\r\nof a vast territory and forces.\" Nothing more was said at the time about\r\nthe marriage; but when Otys was on the point of departure and came to\r\nbid farewell, Agesilaus, having taken care that Spithridates should be\r\nout of the way, in the presence of the Thirty broached the subject: (3)\r\n\"Can you tell me, Otys, to what sort of family Spithridates belongs?\"\r\n\"To one of the noblest in Persia,\" replied the king. Agesilaus: \"Have\r\nyou observed how beautiful his son is?\" Otys: \"To be sure; last evening\r\nI was supping with him.\" Agesilaus: \"And they tell me his daughter\r\nis yet more beautiful.\" Otys: \"That may well be; beautiful she is.\"\r\nAgesilaus: \"For my part, as you have proved so good a friend to us, I\r\nshould like to advise you to take this girl to wife. Not only is she\r\nvery beautiful--and what more should a husband ask for?--but her\r\nfather is of noble family, and has a force at his back large enough to\r\nretaliate on Pharnabazus for an injury. He has made the satrap, as you\r\nsee, a fugitive and a vagabond in his own vast territory. I need not\r\ntell you,\" he added, \"that a man who can so chastise an enemy is well\r\nable to benefit a friend; and of this be assured: by such an alliance\r\nyou will gain not the connection of Spithridates alone, but of myself\r\nand the Lacedaemonians, and, as we are the leaders of Hellas, of\r\nthe rest of Hellas also. And what a wedding yours will be! Were ever\r\nnuptials celebrated on so grand a scale before? Was ever bride led home\r\nby such an escort of cavalry and light-armed troops and heavy infantry,\r\nas shall escort your wife home to your palace?\" Otys asked: \"Is\r\nSpithridates of one mind with you in this proposal?\" and Agesilaus\r\nanswered: \"In good sooth he did not bid me make it for him. And for\r\nmy own part in the matter, though it is, I admit, a rare pleasure to\r\nrequite an enemy, yet I had far rather at any time discover some good\r\nfortune for my friends.\" Otys: \"Why not ask if your project pleases\r\nSpithridates too?\" Then Agesilaus, turning to Herippidas and the rest\r\nof the Thirty, bade them go to Spithridates; \"and give him such good\r\ninstruction,\" he added, \"that he shall wish what we wish.\" The Thirty\r\nrose and retired to administer their lesson. But they seemed to tarry\r\na long time, and Agesilaus asked: \"What say you, King Otys--shall we\r\nsummon him hither ourselves? You, I feel certain, are better able to\r\npersuade him than the whole Thirty put together.\" Thereupon Agesilaus\r\nsummoned Spithridates and the others. As they came forward, Herippidas\r\npromptly delivered himself thus: \"I spare you the details, Agesilaus.\r\nTo make a long story short, Spithridates says, 'He will be glad to do\r\nwhatever pleases you.'\" Then Agesilaus, turning first to one and then\r\nto the other: \"What pleases me,\" said he, \"is that you should wed a\r\ndaughter--and you a wife--so happily. (4) But,\" he added, \"I do not see\r\nhow we can well bring home the bride by land till spring.\" \"No, not by\r\nland,\" the suitor answered, \"but you might, if you chose, conduct her\r\nhome at once by sea.\" Thereupon they exchanged pledges to ratify the\r\ncompact; and so sent Otys rejoicing on his way.\r\n\r\n (2) See \"Ages.\" iii. 4, where he is called Cotys.\r\n\r\n (3) I.e. \"Spartan counsellors.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"and may the wedding be blest!\"\r\n\r\nAgesilaus, who had not failed to note the king's impatience, at once\r\nfitted out a ship of war and gave orders to Callias, a Lacedaemonian,\r\nto escort the maiden to her new home; after which he himself began his\r\nmarch on Dascylium. Here was the palace of Pharnabazus. It lay in the\r\nmidst of abundant supplies. Here, too, were most fair hunting grounds,\r\noffering the hunter choice between enclosed parks (5) and a wide expanse\r\nof field and fell; and all around there flowed a river full of fish\r\nof every sort; and for the sportsman versed in fowling, winged game in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n (5) Lit. \"paradises.\" See \"Anab.\" I. ii. 7; \"Cyrop.\" I. iv. 11.\r\n\r\nIn these quarters the Spartan king passed the winter, collecting\r\nsupplies for the army either on the spot or by a system of forage. On\r\none of these occasions the troops, who had grown reckless and scornful\r\nof the enemy through long immunity from attack, whilst engaged\r\nin collecting supplies were scattered over the flat country, when\r\nPharnabazus fell upon them with two scythe-chariots and about four\r\nhundred horse. Seeing him thus advancing, the Hellenes ran together,\r\nmustering possibly seven hundred men. The Persian did not hesitate, but\r\nplacing his chariots in front, supported by himself and the cavalry, he\r\ngave the command to charge. The scythe-chariots charged and scattered\r\nthe compact mass, and speedily the cavalry had laid low in the dust\r\nabout a hundred men, while the rest retreated hastily, under cover of\r\nAgesilaus and his hoplites, who were fortunately near.\r\n\r\nIt was the third or fourth day after this that Spithridates made a\r\ndiscovery: Pharnabazus lay encamped in Caue, a large village not more\r\nthan eighteen miles (6) away. This news he lost no time in reporting\r\nto Herippidas. The latter, who was longing for some brilliant exploit,\r\nbegged Agesilaus to furnish him with two thousand hoplites, an equal\r\nnumber of peltasts, and some cavalry--the latter to consist of the\r\nhorsemen of Spithridates, the Paphlagonians, and as many Hellene\r\ntroopers as he might perchance persuade to follow him. Having got the\r\npromise of them from Agesilaus, he proceeded to take the auspices.\r\nTowards late afternoon he obtained favourable omens and broke off the\r\nsacrifice. Thereupon he ordered the troops to get their evening meal,\r\nafter which they were to present themselves in front of the camp. But by\r\nthe time darkness had closed in, not one half of them had come out. To\r\nabandon the project was to call down the ridicule of the rest of the\r\nThirty. So he set out with the force to hand, and about daylight,\r\nfalling on the camp of Pharnabazus, put many of his advanced guard\r\nof Mysians to the sword. The men themselves made good their escape in\r\ndifferent directions, but the camp was taken, and with it divers goblets\r\nand other gear such as a man like Pharnabazus would have, not to speak\r\nof much baggage and many baggage animals. It was the dread of being\r\nsurrounded and besieged, if he should establish himself for long at any\r\none spot, which induced Pharnabazus to flee in gipsy fashion from point\r\nto point over the country, carefully obliterating his encampments.\r\nNow as the Paphlagonians and Spithridates brought back the captured\r\nproperty, they were met by Herippidas with his brigadiers and captains,\r\nwho stopped them and (7) relieved them of all they had; the object being\r\nto have as large a list as possible of captures to deliver over to the\r\nofficers who superintended the sale of booty. (8) This treatment the\r\nAsiatics found intolerable. They deemed themselves at once injured\r\nand insulted, got their kit together in the night, and made off in the\r\ndirection of Sardis to join Ariaeus without mistrust, seeing that he\r\ntoo had revolted and gone to war with the king. On Agesilaus himself\r\nno heavier blow fell during the whole campaign than the desertion of\r\nSpithridates and Megabates and the Paphlagonians.\r\n\r\n (6) Lit. \"one hundred and sixty stades.\"\r\n\r\n (7) Or, \"captains posted to intercept them, who relieved...\" See\r\n    \"Anab.\" IV. i. 14.\r\n\r\n (8) See \"Pol. Lac.\" xiii. 11, for these officers.\r\n\r\nNow there was a certain man of Cyzicus, Apollophanes by name; he was an\r\nold friend of Pharnabazus, and at this time had become a friend also\r\nof Agesilaus. (9) This man informed Agesilaus that he thought he could\r\nbring about a meeting between him and Pharnabazus, which might tend to\r\nfriendship; and having so got ear of him, he obtained pledges of good\r\nfaith between his two friends, and presented himself with Pharnabazus at\r\nthe trysting-place, where Agesilaus with the Thirty around him awaited\r\ntheir coming, reclined upon a grassy sward. Pharnabazus presently\r\narrived clad in costliest apparel; but just as his attendants were about\r\nto spread at his feet the carpets on which the Persians delicately seat\r\nthemselves, he was touched with a sense of shame at his own luxury\r\nin sight of the simplicity of Agesilaus, and he also without further\r\nceremony seated himself on the bare ground. And first the two bade one\r\nanother hail, and then Pharnabazus stretched out his right hand and\r\nAgesilaus his to meet him, and the conversation began. Pharnabazus, as\r\nthe elder of the two, spoke first. \"Agesilaus,\" he said, \"and all you\r\nLacedaemonians here present, while you were at war with the Athenians\r\nI was your friend and ally; it was I who furnished the wealth that made\r\nyour navy strong on sea; on land I fought on horseback by your side,\r\nand pursued your enemies into the sea. (10) As to duplicity like that of\r\nTissaphernes, I challenge you to accuse me of having played you false by\r\nword or deed. Such have I ever been; and in return how am I treated\r\nby yourselves to-day?--in such sort that I cannot even sup in my own\r\ncountry unless, like the wild animals, I pick up the scraps you chance\r\nto leave. The beautiful palaces which my father left me as an heirloom,\r\nthe parks (11) full of trees and beasts of the chase in which my heart\r\nrejoiced, lie before my eyes hacked to pieces, burnt to ashes. Maybe I\r\ndo not comprehend the first principles of justice and holiness; do you\r\nthen explain to me how all this resembles the conduct of men who know\r\nhow to repay a simple debt of gratitude.\" He ceased, and the Thirty were\r\nashamed before him and kept silence.

B.C. 378, fl. B.C. 333),\r\n    \"in the eleventh book  (of his {Suntazis Ellenikon}) borrowed\r\n    Xenophon's lively account of the interview between Agesilaus and\r\n    Pharnabazus (Apollonius apud Euseb. B, \"Praep. Evang.\" p. 465).\"\r\n    See \"Hist. Lit. of Anc. Gr.,\" Muller and Donaldson, ii. p. 380.\r\n\r\nAt length, after some pause, Agesilaus spoke. \"I think you are aware,\"\r\nhe said, \"Pharnabazus, that within the states of Hellas the folk of\r\none community contract relations of friendship and hospitality with one\r\nanother; (13) but if these states should go to war, then each man will\r\nside with his fatherland, and friend will find himself pitted against\r\nfriend in the field of battle, and, if it so betide, the one may even\r\ndeal the other his death-blow. So too we to-day, being at war with your\r\nsovereign lord the king, must needs regard as our enemy all that he\r\ncalls his; not but that with yourself personally we should esteem it\r\nour high fortune to be friends. If indeed it were merely an exchange of\r\nservice--were you asked to give up your lord the king and to take us as\r\nyour masters in his stead, I could not so advise you; but the fact is,\r\nby joining with us it is in your power to-day to bow your head to no\r\nman, to call no man master, to reap the produce of your own domain in\r\nfreedom--freedom, which to my mind is more precious than all riches. Not\r\nthat we bid you to become a beggar for the sake of freedom, but rather\r\nto use our friendship to increase not the king's authority, but your\r\nown, by subduing those who are your fellow-slaves to-day, and who\r\nto-morrow shall be your willing subjects. Well, then, freedom given and\r\nwealth added--what more would you desire to fill the cup of happiness to\r\noverflowing?\" Pharnabazus replied: \"Shall I tell you plainly what I will\r\ndo?\" \"That were but kind and courteous on your part,\" he answered. \"Thus\r\nit stands with me, then,\" said Pharnabazus. \"If the king should send\r\nanother general, and if he should wish to rank me under this new\r\nman's orders, I, for my part, am willing to accept your friendship and\r\nalliance; but if he offers me the supreme command--why, then, I plainly\r\ntell you, there is a certain something in the very name ambition which\r\nwhispers me that I shall war against you to the best of my ability.\"\r\n(14) When he heard that, Agesilaus seized the satrap's hand, exclaiming:\r\n\"Ah, best of mortals, may the day arrive which sends us such a friend!\r\nOf one thing rest assured. This instant I leave your territory with what\r\nhaste I may, and for the future--even in case of war--as long as we can\r\nfind foes elsewhere our hands shall hold aloof from you and yours.\"\r\n\r\n (13) Or, add, \"we call them guest friends.\"\r\n\r\n (14) Or, \"so subtle a force, it seems, is the love of honour that.\"\r\n    Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 386; cf. Herod. iii. 57 for \"ambition,\"\r\n    {philotimia}.\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he broke up the meeting. Pharnabazus mounted his\r\nhorse and rode away, but his son by Parapita, who was still in the bloom\r\nof youth, lingered behind; then, running up to Agesilaus, he exclaimed:\r\n\"See, I choose you as my friend.\" \"And I accept you,\" replied the king.\r\n\"Remember, then,\" the lad answered, and with the word presented the\r\nbeautiful javelin in his hand to Agesilaus, who received it, and\r\nunclasping a splendid trapping (15) which his secretary, Idaeus, had\r\nround the neck of his charger, he gave it in return to the youth;\r\nwhereupon the boy leapt on his horse's back and galloped after his\r\nfather. (16) At a later date, during the absence of Pharnabazus abroad,\r\nthis same youth, the son of Parapita, was deprived of the government by\r\nhis brother and driven into exile. Then Agesilaus took great interest\r\nin him, and as he had a strong attachment to the son of Eualces, an\r\nAthenian, Agesilaus did all he could to have this friend of his, who\r\nwas the tallest of the boys, admitted to the two hundred yards race at\r\nOlympia.\r\n\r\n (15) {phalara}, bosses of gold, silver, or other metals, cast or\r\n    chased, with some appropriate device in relief, which were worn as\r\n    an ornamental trapping for horses, affixed to the head-stall or to\r\n    a throat-collar, or to a martingale over the chest.--Rich's\r\n    \"Companion to Lat.

But to return to the actual moment. Agesilaus was as good as\r\nhis word, and at once marched out of the territory of Pharnabazus. The\r\nseason verged on spring. Reaching the plain of Thebe, (17) he encamped\r\nin the neighbourhood of the temple of Artemis of Astyra, (18) and there\r\nemployed himself in collecting troops from every side, in addition to\r\nthose which he already had, so as to form a complete armament. These\r\npreparations were pressed forward with a view to penetrating as far as\r\npossible into the interior. He was persuaded that every tribe or nation\r\nplaced in his rear might be considered as alienated from the king.\r\n\r\n (17) \"Anab.\" VII. viii. 7.\r\n\r\n (18) Vide Strab. xiii. 606, 613. Seventy stades from Thebe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSuch were the concerns and projects of Agesilaus. Meanwhile the\r\nLacedaemonians at home were quite alive to the fact that moneys had been\r\nsent into Hellas, and that the bigger states were leagued together\r\nto declare war against them. It was hard to avoid the conclusion that\r\nSparta herself was in actual danger, and that a campaign was inevitable.\r\nWhile busy, therefore, with preparations themselves, they lost no time\r\nin despatching Epicydidas to fetch Agesilaus. That officer, on his\r\narrival, explained the position of affairs, and concluded by delivering\r\na peremptory summons of the state recalling him to the assistance of\r\nthe fatherland without delay. The announcement could not but come as a\r\ngrievous blow to Agesilaus, as he reflected on the vanished hopes, and\r\nthe honours plucked from his grasp. Still, he summoned the allies and\r\nannounced to them the contents of the despatch from home. \"To aid our\r\nfatherland,\" he added, \"is an imperative duty. If, however, matters turn\r\nout well on the other side, rely upon it, friends and allies, I will\r\nnot forget you, but I shall be back anon to carry out your wishes.\" When\r\nthey heard the announcement many wept, and they passed a resolution, one\r\nand all, to assist Agesilaus in assisting Lacedaemon; if matters turned\r\nout well there, they undertook to take him as their leader and come back\r\nagain to Asia; and so they fell to making preparations to follow him.\r\n\r\nAgesilaus, on his side, determined to leave behind him in Asia Euxenus\r\nas governor, and with him a garrison numbering no less than four\r\nthousand troops, which would enable him to protect the states in Asia.\r\nBut for himself, as on the one hand he could see that the majority of\r\nthe soldiers would far rather stay behind than undertake service against\r\nfellow-Hellenes, and on the other hand he wished to take as fine and\r\nlarge an army with him as he could, he offered prizes first to that\r\nstate or city which should continue the best corps of troops, and\r\nsecondly to that captain of mercenaries who should join the expedition\r\nwith the best equipped battalion of heavy infantry, archers, and light\r\ninfantry. On the same principle he informed the chief cavalry officers\r\nthat the general who succeeded in presenting the best accoutred and best\r\nmounted regiment would receive from himself some victorious distinction.\r\n\"The final adjudication,\" he said, \"would not be made until they had\r\ncrossed from Asia into Europe and had reached the Chersonese; and this\r\nwith a view to impress upon them that the prizes were not for show but\r\nfor real campaigners.\" (1) These consisted for the most part of infantry\r\nor cavalry arms and accoutrements tastefully furnished, besides which\r\nthere were chaplets of gold. The whole, useful and ornamental alike,\r\nmust have cost nearly a thousand pounds, (2) but as the result of this\r\noutlay, no doubt, arms of great value were procured for the expedition.\r\n(3) When the Hellespont was crossed the judges were appointed. The\r\nLacedaemonians were represented by Menascus, Herippidas, and\r\nOrsippus, and the allies by one member from each state. As soon as the\r\nadjudication was complete, the army commenced its march with Agesilaus\r\nat its head, following the very route taken by the great king when he\r\ninvaded Hellas.\r\n\r\n (1) Or, \"that the perfection of equipment was regarded as anticipative\r\n    of actual service in the field.\" Cobet suggests for {eukrinein}\r\n    {dieukrinein}; cf. \"Oecon.\" viii. 6.\r\n\r\n (2) Lit. \"at least four talents\" = 975 pounds.\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"beyond which, the arms and material to equip the expedition\r\n    were no doubt highly costly.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the ephors had called out the ban, and as Agesipolis was still\r\na boy, the state called upon Aristodemus, who was of the royal family\r\nand guardian of the young king, to lead the expedition; and now that\r\nthe Lacedaemonians were ready to take the field and the forces of their\r\nopponents were duly mustered, the latter met (4) to consider the most\r\nadvantageous method of doing battle.\r\n\r\n (4) At Corinth. See above, III. iv. 11; below, V. iv. 61, where the\r\n    victory of Nixos is described but not localised.\r\n\r\nTimolaus of Corinth spoke: \"Soldiers of the allied forces,\" he said,\r\n\"the growth of Lacedaemon seems to me just like that of some mighty\r\nriver--at its sources small and easily crossed, but as it farther and\r\nfarther advances, other rivers discharge themselves into its channel, and\r\nits stream grows ever more formidable. So is it with the Lacedaemonians.\r\nTake them at the starting-point and they are but a single community, but\r\nas they advance and attach city after city they grow more numerous\r\nand more resistless. I observe that when people wish to take wasps'\r\nnests--if they try to capture the creatures on the wing, they are liable\r\nto be attacked by half the hive; whereas, if they apply fire to them ere\r\nthey leave their homes, they will master them without scathe themselves.\r\nOn this principle I think it best to bring about the battle within the\r\nhive itself, or, short of that, as close to Lacedaemon as possible.\" (5)\r\n\r\n (5) Or, \"if not actually at Lacedaemon, then at least as near as\r\n    possible to the hornet's nest.\"\r\n\r\nThe arguments of the speaker were deemed sound, and a resolution was\r\npassed in that sense; but before it could be carried out there were\r\nvarious arrangements to be made. There was the question of headship.\r\nThen, again, what was the proper depth of line to be given to the\r\ndifferent army corps? for if any particular state or states gave too\r\ngreat a depth to their battle line they would enable the enemy to turn\r\ntheir flank. Whilst they were debating these points, the Lacedaemonians\r\nhad incorporated the men of Tegea and the men of Mantinea, and were\r\nready to debouch into the bimarine region. (6) And as the two armies\r\nadvanced almost at the same time, the Corinthians and the rest reached\r\nthe Nemea, (7) and the Lacedaemonians and their allies occupied Sicyon.\r\nThe Lacedaemonians entered by Epieiceia, and at first were severely\r\nhandled by the light-armed troops of the enemy, who discharged stones\r\nand arrows from the vantage-ground on their right; but as they dropped\r\ndown upon the Gulf of Corinth they advanced steadily onwards through the\r\nflat country, felling timber and burning the fair land. Their rivals, on\r\ntheir side, after a certain forward movement, (8) paused and encamped,\r\nplacing the ravine in front of them; but still the Lacedaemonians\r\nadvanced, and it was only when they were within ten furlongs (9) of the\r\nhostile position that they followed suit and encamped, and then they\r\nremained quiet.\r\n\r\n (6) I.e. \"the shores of the Corinthian Gulf.\" Or, \"upon the strand or\r\n    coast road or coast land of Achaia\"  (aliter {ten aigialon}(?) the\r\n    Strand of the Corinthian Gulf, the old name of this part of\r\n    Achaia).\r\n\r\n (7) Or, \"the district of Nemea.\"\r\n\r\n (8) {epelthontes}, but see Grote (\"H. G.\" ix. 425 note), who prefers\r\n    {apelthontes} = retreated and encamped.\r\n\r\n (9) Lit. \"ten stades.\" For the numbers below, see Grote, \"H. G.\" ix.\r\n    422, note 1.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may state the numbers on either side. The Lacedaemonian\r\nheavy-armed infantry levies amounted to six thousand men. Of Eleians,\r\nTriphylians, Acroreians, and Lasionians, there must have been nearly\r\nthree thousand, with fifteen hundred Sicyonians, while Epidaurus,\r\nTroezen, Hermione, and Halieis (10) contributed at least another three\r\nthousand. To these heavy infantry troops must be added six hundred\r\nLacedaemonian cavalry, a body of Cretan archers about three hundred\r\nstrong, besides another force of slingers, at least four hundred in\r\nall, consisting of Marganians, Letrinians, and Amphidolians. The men\r\nof Phlius were not represented. Their plea was they were keeping \"holy\r\ntruce.\" That was the total of the forces on the Lacedaemonian side.\r\nThere was collected on the enemy's side six thousand Athenian heavy\r\ninfantry, with about, as was stated, seven thousand Argives, and in the\r\nabsence of the men of Orchomenus something like five thousand Boeotians.\r\nThere were besides three thousand Corinthians, and again from the whole\r\nof Euboea at least three thousand. These formed the heavy infantry.\r\nOf cavalry the Boeotians, again in the absence of the Orchomenians,\r\nfurnished eight hundred, the Athenians (11) six hundred, the Chalcidians\r\nof Euboea one hundred, the Opuntian Locrians (12) fifty. Their light\r\ntroops, including those of the Corinthians, were more numerous, as the\r\nOzolian Locrians, the Melians, and Arcarnanians (13) helped to swell\r\ntheir numbers.\r\n\r\n (10) Halieis, a seafaring people (Strabo, viii. 373) and town on the\r\n    coast of Hermionis; Herod. vii. 137; Thuc. i. 105, ii. 56, iv. 45;\r\n    Diod. xi. 78; \"Hell.\" VI. ii. 3.\r\n\r\n (11) For a treaty between Athens and Eretria, B.C. 395, see Hicks, 66;\r\n    and below, \"Hell.\" IV. iii. 15; Hicks, 68, 69; Diod. xiv. 82.\r\n\r\n (12) See above, \"Hell.\" III. v. 3.\r\n\r\n (13) See below, \"Hell.\" IV. vi. 1; ib. vii. 1; VI. v. 23.\r\n\r\nSuch was the strength of the two armies. The Boeotians, as long as they\r\noccupied the left wing, showed no anxiety to join battle, but after a\r\nrearrangement which gave them the right, placing the Athenians opposite\r\nthe Lacedaemonians, and themselves opposite the Achaeans, at once, we\r\nare told, (14) the victims proved favourable, and the order was passed\r\nalong the lines to prepare for immediate action. The Boeotians, in the\r\nfirst place, abandoning the rule of sixteen deep, chose to give their\r\ndivision the fullest possible depth, and, moreover, kept veering\r\nmore and more to their right, with the intention of overlapping their\r\nopponent's flank. The consequence was that the Athenians, to avoid being\r\nabsolutely severed, were forced to follow suit, and edged towards the\r\nright, though they recognised the risk they ran of having their flank\r\nturned. For a while the Lacedaemonians had no idea of the advance of the\r\nenemy, owing to the rough nature of the ground, (15) but the notes of\r\nthe paean at length announced to them the fact, and without an instant's\r\ndelay the answering order \"prepare for battle\" ran along the different\r\nsections of their army. As soon as their troops were drawn up, according\r\nto the tactical disposition of the various generals of foreign brigades,\r\nthe order was passed to \"follow the lead,\" and then the Lacedaemonians\r\non their side also began edging to their right, and eventually stretched\r\nout their wing so far that only six out of the ten regimental divisions\r\nof the Athenians confronted the Lacedaemonians, the other four finding\r\nthemselves face to face with the men of Tegea. And now when they\r\nwere less than a furlong (16) apart, the Lacedaemonians sacrificed in\r\ncustomary fashion a kid to the huntress goddess, (17) and advanced upon\r\ntheir opponents, wheeling round their overlapping columns to outflank\r\nhis left. As the two armies closed, the allies of Lacedaemon were as\r\na rule fairly borne down by their opponents. The men of Pellene alone,\r\nsteadily confronting the Thespiaeans, held their ground, and the dead\r\nof either side strewed the position. (18) As to the Lacedaemonians\r\nthemselves: crushing that portion of the Athenian troops which lay\r\nimmediately in front of them, and at the same time encircling them\r\nwith their overlapping right, they slew man after man of them; and,\r\nabsolutely unscathed themselves, their unbroken columns continued their\r\nmarch, and so passed behind the four remaining divisions (19) of the\r\nAthenians before these latter had returned from their own victorious\r\npursuit. Whereby the four divisions in question also emerged from battle\r\nintact, except for the casualties inflicted by the Tegeans in the\r\nfirst clash of the engagement. The troops next encountered by the\r\nLacedaemonians were the Argives retiring. These they fell foul of, and\r\nthe senior polemarch was just on the point of closing with them \"breast\r\nto breast\" when some one, it is said, shouted, \"Let their front ranks\r\npass.\" This was done, and as the Argives raced past, their enemies\r\nthrust at their unprotected (20) sides and killed many of them. The\r\nCorinthians were caught in the same way as they retired, and when their\r\nturn had passed, once more the Lacedaemonians lit upon a portion of the\r\nTheban division retiring from the pursuit, and strewed the field with\r\ntheir dead. The end of it all was that the defeated troops in the first\r\ninstance made for safety to the walls of their city, but the Corinthians\r\nwithin closed the gates, whereupon the troops took up quarters once\r\nagain in their old encampment. The Lacedaemonians on their side withdrew\r\nto the point at which they first closed with the enemy, and there set up\r\na trophy of victory. So the battle ended.\r\n\r\n (14) Or, \"then they lost no time in discovering that the victims\r\n    proved favourable.\"\r\n\r\n (15) See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 428; cf. Lys. \"pro Mant.\" 20.\r\n\r\n (16) Lit. \"a stade.\"\r\n\r\n (17) Lit. \"our Lady of the Chase.\" See \"Pol.

He had reached Amphipolis when Dercylidas brought the news of this\r\nfresh victory of the Lacedaemonians; their own loss had been eight men,\r\nthat of the enemy considerable. It was his business at the same time to\r\nexplain that not a few of the allies had fallen also. Agesilaus\r\nasked, \"Would it not be opportune, Dercylidas, if the cities that have\r\nfurnished us with contingents could hear of this victory as soon as\r\npossible?\" And Dercylidas replied: \"The news at any rate is likely\r\nto put them in better heart.\" Then said the king: \"As you were an\r\neye-witness there could hardly be a better bearer of the news than\r\nyourself.\" To this proposal Dercylidas lent a willing ear--to travel\r\nabroad (1) was his special delight--and he replied, \"Yes, under your\r\norders.\" \"Then you have my orders,\" the king said. \"And you may further\r\ninform the states from myself that we have not forgotten our promise;\r\nif all goes well over here we shall be with them again ere long.\"\r\nSo Dercylidas set off on his travels, in the first instance to the\r\nHellespont; (2) while Agesilaus crossed Macedonia, and arrived in\r\nThessaly. And now the men of Larissa, Crannon, Scotussa, and Pharsalus,\r\nwho were allies of the Boeotians--and in fact all the Thessalians except\r\nthe exiles for the time being--hung on his heels (3) and did him damage.\r\n\r\n (1) See \"Pol. Lac.\" xiv. 4.\r\n\r\n (2) See below, \"Hell.\" IV. viii. 3.\r\n\r\n (3) See \"Ages.\" ii. 2; Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 420, note 2.\r\n\r\nFor some while he marched his troops in a hollow square, (4) posting\r\nhalf his cavalry in front and half on his rear; but finding that the\r\nThessalians checked his passage by repeated charges from behind, he\r\nstrengthened his rearguard by sending round the cavalry from his van,\r\nwith the exception of his own personal escort. (5) The two armies stood\r\nconfronted in battle order; but the Thessalians, not liking the notion\r\nof a cavalry engagement with heavy infantry, turned, and step by step\r\nretreated, while the others followed them with considerable caution.\r\nAgesilaus, perceiving the error under which both alike laboured, now\r\nsent his own personal guard of stalwart troopers with orders that both\r\nthey and the rest of the horsemen should charge at full gallop, (6)\r\nand not give the enemy the chance to recoil. The Thessalians were taken\r\naback by this unexpected onslaught, and half of them never thought of\r\nwheeling about, whilst those who did essay to do so presented the\r\nflanks of their horses to the charge, (7) and were made prisoners.\r\nStill Polymarchus of Pharsalus, the general in command of their cavalry,\r\nrallied his men for an instant, and fell, sword in hand, with his\r\nimmediate followers. This was the signal for a flight so precipitate on\r\nthe part of the Thessalians, that their dead and dying lined the road,\r\nand prisoners were taken; nor was any halt made until they reached Mount\r\nNarthacius. Here, then, midway between Pras and Narthacius, Agesilaus\r\nset up a trophy, halting for the moment, in unfeigned satisfaction at\r\nthe exploit. It was from antagonists who prided themselves on their\r\ncavalry beyond everything that he had wrested victory, with a body\r\nof cavalry of his own mustering. Next day he crossed the mountains\r\nof Achaea Phthiotis, and for the future continued his march through\r\nfriendly territory until he reached the confines of Boeotia.\r\n\r\n (4) See Rustow and Kochly, S. 187 foll.\r\n\r\n (5) See Thuc. v. 72; Herod. vi. 56, viii. 124.\r\n\r\n (6) Lit. \"and bids them pass the order to the others and themselves to\r\n    charge,\" etc.\r\n\r\n (7) See \"Horsemanship,\" vii. 16; Polyb. iv. 8.\r\n\r\nHere, at the entrance of that territory, the sun (in partial eclipse)\r\n(8) seemed to appear in a crescent shape, and the news reached him of\r\nthe defeat of the Lacedaemonians in a naval engagement, and the death\r\nof the admiral Peisander. Details of the disaster were not wanting. The\r\nengagement of the hostile fleets took place off Cnidus. Pharnabazus, the\r\nPersian admiral, was present with the Phoenician fleet, and in front\r\nof him were ranged the ships of the Hellenic squadron under Conon.\r\nPeisander had ventured to draw out his squadron to meet the combined\r\nfleets, though the numerical inferiority of his fleet to that of the\r\nHellenic navy under Conon was conspicuous, and he had the mortification\r\nof seeing the allies who formed his left wing take to flight\r\nimmediately. He himself came to close quarters with the enemy, and was\r\ndriven on shore, on board his trireme, under pressure of the hostile\r\nrams. The rest, as many as were driven to shore, deserted their ships\r\nand sought safety as best they could in the territory of Cnidus. The\r\nadmiral alone stuck to his ship, and fell sword in hand.\r\n\r\n (8) B.C. 394, August 14.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Agesilaus not to feel depressed by those tidings\r\nat first; on further reflection, however, it seemed to him that the\r\nmoral quality of more than half his troops well entitled them to share\r\nin the sunshine of success, but in the day of trouble, when things\r\nlooked black, he was not bound to take them into his confidence.\r\nAccordingly he turned round and gave out that he had received news that\r\nPeisander was dead, but that he had fallen in the arms of victory in\r\na sea-fight; and suiting his action to the word, he proceeded to offer\r\nsacrifice in return for good tidings, (9) distributing portions of the\r\nvictims to a large number of recipients. So it befell that in the first\r\nskirmish with the enemy the troops of Agesilaus gained the upper hand,\r\nin consequence of the report that the Lacedaemonians had won a victory\r\nby sea.\r\n\r\n (9) \"Splendide mendax.\" For the ethics of the matter, see \"Mem.\" IV.\r\n    ii. 17; \"Cyrop.\" I. vi. 31.\r\n\r\nTo confront Agesilaus stood an army composed of the Boeotians,\r\nAthenians, Argives, Corinthians, Aenianians, Euboeans, and both\r\ndivisions of the Locrians. Agesilaus on his side had with him a division\r\n(10) of Lacedaemonians, which had crossed from Corinth, also half the\r\ndivision from Orchomenus; besides which there were the neodamodes (11)\r\nfrom Lacedaemon, on service with him already; and in addition to these\r\nthe foreign contingent under Herippidas; (12) and again the quota\r\nfurnished by the Hellenic cities in Asia, with others from the cities in\r\nEurope which he had brought over during his progress; and lastly, there\r\nwere additional levies from the spot--Orchomenian and Phocian heavy\r\ninfantry. In light-armed troops, it must be admitted, the numbers told\r\nheavily in favour of Agesilaus, but the cavalry (13) on both sides were\r\nfairly balanced.\r\n\r\n (10) Lit. \"a mora\"; for the numbers, see \"Ages.\" ii. 6; Plut. \"Ages.\"\r\n    17; Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 433.\r\n\r\n (11) I.e. \"enfranchised helots.\"\r\n\r\n (12) See \"Ages.\" ii. 10, 11; and above, \"Hell.\" III. iv. 20.\r\n\r\n (13) See Hicks, op. cit. 68.\r\n\r\nSuch were the forces of either party. I will describe the battle itself,\r\nif only on account of certain features which distinguish it from the\r\nbattles of our time. The two armies met on the plain of Coronea--the\r\ntroops of Agesilaus advancing from the Cephisus, the Thebans and their\r\nallies from the slopes of Helicon. Agesilaus commanded his own right\r\nin person, with the men of Orchomenus on his extreme left. The Thebans\r\nformed their own right, while the Argives held their left. As they drew\r\ntogether, for a while deep silence reigned on either side; but when they\r\nwere not more than a furlong (14) apart, with the loud hurrah (15) the\r\nThebans, quickening to a run, rushed furiously (16) to close quarters;\r\nand now there was barely a hundred yards (17) breadth between the two\r\narmies, when Herippidas with his foreign brigade, and with them the\r\nIonians, Aeolians, and Hellespontines, darted out from the Spartans'\r\nbattle-lines to greet their onset. One and all of the above played their\r\npart in the first rush forward; in another instant they were (18) within\r\nspear-thrust of the enemy, and had routed the section immediately before\r\nthem. As to the Argives, they actually declined to receive the attack\r\nof Agesilaus, and betook themselves in flight to Helicon. At this\r\nmoment some of the foreign division were already in the act of crowning\r\nAgesilaus with the wreath of victory, when some one brought him word\r\nthat the Thebans had cut through the Orchomenians and were in among the\r\nbaggage train. At this the Spartan general immediately turned his army\r\nright about and advanced against them. The Thebans, on their side,\r\ncatching sight of their allies withdrawn in flight to the base of the\r\nHelicon, and anxious to get across to their own friends, formed in close\r\norder and tramped forward stoutly.\r\n\r\n (14) Lit. \"a stade.\"\r\n\r\n (15) Lit. \"Alalah.\"\r\n\r\n (16) Like a tornado.\r\n\r\n (17) Lit. \"about three plethra.\"\r\n\r\n (18) Or, \"All these made up the attacking columns... and coming\r\n    within... routed...\"\r\n\r\nAt this point no one will dispute the valour of Agesilaus, but he\r\ncertainly did not choose the safest course. It was open to him to make\r\nway for the enemy to pass, which done, he might have hung upon his heels\r\nand mastered his rear. This, however, he refused to do, preferring to\r\ncrash full front against the Thebans. Thereupon, with close interlock\r\nof shield wedged in with shield, they shoved, they fought, they dealt\r\ndeath, (19) they breathed out life, till at last a portion of the\r\nThebans broke their way through towards Helicon, but paid for that\r\ndeparture by the loss of many lives. And now the victory of Agesilaus\r\nwas fairly won, and he himself, wounded, had been carried back to the\r\nmain line, when a party of horse came galloping up to tell him that\r\nsomething like eighty of the enemy, under arms, were sheltering under\r\nthe temple, and they asked what they ought to do. Agesilaus, though he\r\nwas covered with wounds, did not, for all that, forget his duty to God.\r\nHe gave orders to let them retire unscathed, and would not suffer any\r\ninjury to be done to them. And now, seeing it was already late, they\r\ntook their suppers and retired to rest.\r\n\r\n (19) Or, \"they slew, they were slain.\" In illustration of this famous\r\n    passage, twice again worked up in \"Ages.\" ii. 12, and \"Cyrop.\"\r\n    VII. i. 38, commented on by Longinus, {peri upsous}, 19, and\r\n    copied by Dio Cassius, 47, 45, I venture to quote a passage from\r\n    Mr. Rudyard Kipling, \"With the Main Guard,\" p. 57, Mulvaney\r\n    loquitur: \"The Tyrone was pushin' an' pushin' in, an' our men was\r\n    sweerin' at thim, an' Crook was workin' away in front av us all,\r\n    his sword-arm swingin' like a pump-handle an' his revolver\r\n    spittin' like a cat. But the strange thing av ut was the quiet\r\n    that lay upon. 'Twas like a fight in a dhrame--excipt for thim\r\n    that wus dead.\"\r\n\r\nBut with the morning Gylis the polemarch received orders to draw up the\r\ntroops in battle order, and to set up a trophy, every man crowned with a\r\nwreath in honour of the god, and all the pipers piping. Thus they busied\r\nthemselves in the Spartan camp. On their side the Thebans sent heralds\r\nasking to bury their dead, under a truce; and in this wise a truce was\r\nmade. Agesilaus withdrew to Delphi, where on arrival he offered to\r\nthe god a tithe of the produce of his spoils--no less than a hundred\r\ntalents. (20) Gylis the polemarch meanwhile withdrew into Phocis at the\r\nhead of his troops, and from that district made a hostile advance into\r\nLocris. Here nearly a whole day was spent by the men in freely helping\r\nthemselves to goods and chattels out of the villages and pillaging the\r\ncorn; (21) but as it drew towards evening the troops began to retire,\r\nwith the Lacedaemonians in the rear. The Locrians hung upon their heels\r\nwith a heavy pelt of stones and javelins. Thereupon the Lacedaemonians\r\nturned short round and gave chase, laying some of their assailants low.\r\nThen the Locrians ceased clinging to their rear, but continued their\r\nvolleys from the vantage-ground above. The Lacedaemonians again made\r\nefforts to pursue their persistent foes even up the slope. At last\r\ndarkness descended on them, and as they retired man after man dropped,\r\nsuccumbing to the sheer difficulty of the ground; some in their\r\ninability to see what lay in front, or else shot down by the enemy's\r\nmissiles. It was then that Gylis the polemarch met his end, as also\r\nPelles, who was on his personal staff, and the whole of the Spartans\r\npresent without exception--eighteen or thereabouts--perished, either\r\ncrushed by stones or succumbing to other wounds. Indeed, except for\r\ntimely aid brought from the camp where the men were supping, the chances\r\nare that not a man would have escaped to tell the tale.\r\n\r\n (20) = 25,000 pounds nearly.\r\n\r\n (21) Or, \"not to speak of provisions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThis incident ended the campaign. The army as a whole was disbanded, the\r\ncontingents retiring to their several cities, and Agesilaus home across\r\nthe Gulf by sea.\r\n\r\nB.C. 393. Subsequently (1) the war between the two parties recommenced.\r\nThe Athenians, Boeotians, Argives, and the other allies made Corinth\r\nthe base of their operations; the Lacedaemonians and their allies held\r\nSicyon as theirs. As to the Corinthians, they had to face the fact that,\r\nowing to their proximity to the seat of war, it was their territory\r\nwhich was ravaged and their people who perished, while the rest of\r\nthe allies abode in peace and reaped the fruits of their lands in due\r\nseason. Hence the majority of them, including the better class, desired\r\npeace, and gathering into knots they indoctrinated one another with\r\nthese views.\r\n\r\n (1) B.C. 393. See Grote, ix. p. 455, note 2 foll.; \"Hell.\" IV. viii.\r\n    7.\r\n\r\nB.C. 392. (2) On the other hand, it could hardly escape the notice of\r\nthe allied powers, the Argives, Athenians, and Boeotians, as also those\r\nof the Corinthians themselves who had received a share of the king's\r\nmoneys, or for whatever reason were most directly interested in the war,\r\nthat if they did not promptly put the peace party out of the way, ten\r\nchances to one the old laconising policy would again hold the field. It\r\nseemed there was nothing for it but the remedy of the knife. There was a\r\nrefinement of wickedness in the plan adopted. With most people the life\r\neven of a legally condemned criminal is held sacred during a solemn\r\nseason, but these men deliberately selected the last day of the Eucleia,\r\n(3) when they might reckon on capturing more victims in the crowded\r\nmarket-place, for their murderous purposes. Their agents were supplied\r\nwith the names of those to be gotten rid of, the signal was given, and\r\nthen, drawing their daggers, they fell to work. Here a man was struck\r\ndown standing in the centre of a group of talkers, and there another\r\nseated; a third while peacably enjoying himself at the play; a fourth\r\nactually whilst officiating as a judge at some dramatic contest. (4)\r\nWhen what was taking place became known, there was a general flight on\r\nthe part of the better classes. Some fled to the images of the gods\r\nin the market-place, others to the altars; and here these unhallowed\r\nmiscreants, ringleaders and followers alike, utterly regardless of\r\nduty and law, fell to butchering their victims even within the sacred\r\nprecincts of the gods; so that even some of those against whom no hand\r\nwas lifted--honest, law-abiding folk--were filled with sore amazement\r\nat sight of such impiety. In this way many of the elder citizens, as\r\nmustering more thickly in the market-place, were done to death. The\r\nyounger men, acting on a suspicion conceived by one of their number,\r\nPasimelus, as to what was going to take place, kept quiet in the\r\nKraneion; (5) but hearing screams and shouting and being joined anon by\r\nsome who had escaped from the affair, they took the hint, and, running\r\nup along the slope of the Acrocorinthus, succeeded in repelling an\r\nattack of the Argives and the rest. While they were still deliberating\r\nwhat they ought to do, down fell a capital from its column--without\r\nassignable cause, whether of earthquake or wind. Also, when they\r\nsacrificed, the aspect of the victims was such that the soothsayers said\r\nit was better to descend from that position.\r\n\r\n (2) Others assign the incidents of this whole chapter iv. to B.C. 393.\r\n\r\n (3) The festival of Artemis Eucleia.\r\n\r\n (4) See Diod. xiv. 86.\r\n\r\n (5) See Paus. II. ii. 4.\r\n\r\nSo they retired, in the first instance prepared to go into exile beyond\r\nthe territory of Corinth. It was only upon the persuasion of their\r\nfriends and the earnest entreaties of their mothers and sisters who\r\ncame out to them, supported by the solemn assurance of the men in power\r\nthemselves, who swore to guarantee them against evil consequences, that\r\nsome of them finally consented to return home. Presented to their eyes\r\nwas the spectacle of a tyranny in full exercise, and to their minds the\r\nconsciousness of the obliteration of their city, seeing that boundaries\r\nwere plucked up and the land of their fathers had come to be re-entitled\r\nby the name of Argos instead of Corinth; and furthermore, compulsion was\r\nput upon them to share in the constitution in vogue at Argos, for which\r\nthey had little appetite, while in their own city they wielded less\r\npower than the resident aliens. So that a party sprang up among them\r\nwhose creed was, that life was not worth living on such terms: their\r\nendeavour must be to make their fatherland once more the Corinth of old\r\ndays--to restore freedom to their city, purified from the murderer and\r\nhis pollution and fairly rooted in good order and legality. (6) It was\r\na design worth the venture: if they succeeded they would become the\r\nsaviours of their country; if not--why, in the effort to grasp the\r\nfairest flower of happiness, they would but overreach, and find instead\r\na glorious termination to existence.\r\n\r\n (6) {eunomia}. See \"Pol. Ath.\" i. 8; Arist. \"Pol.\" iv. 8, 6; iii. 9,\r\n    8; v. 7, 4.\r\n\r\nIt was in furtherance of this design that two men--Pasimelus and\r\nAlcimenes--undertook to creep through a watercourse and effect a meeting\r\nwith Praxitas the polemarch of the Lacedaemonians, who was on garrison\r\nduty with his own division in Sicyon. They told him they could give\r\nhim ingress at a point in the long walls leading to Lechaeum. Praxitas,\r\nknowing from previous experience that the two men might be relied upon,\r\nbelieved their statement; and having arranged for the further detention\r\nin Sicyon of the division which was on the point of departure, he busied\r\nhimself with plans for the enterprise. When the two men, partly by\r\nchance and partly by contrivance, came to be on guard at the gate where\r\nthe tophy now stands, without further ado Praxitas presented himself\r\nwith his division, taking with him also the men of Sicyon and the whole\r\nof the Corinthian exiles. (7) Having reached the gate, he had a qualm of\r\nmisgiving, and hesitated to step inside until he had first sent in a\r\nman on whom he could rely to take a look at things within. The two\r\nCorinthians introduced him, and made so simple and straightforward\r\na representation (8) that the visitor was convinced, and reported\r\neverything as free of pitfalls as the two had asserted. Then the\r\npolemarch entered, but owing to the wide space between the double\r\nwalls, as soon as they came to form in line within, the intruders were\r\nimpressed by the paucity of their numbers. They therefore erected a\r\nstockade, and dug as good a trench as they could in front of them,\r\npending the arrival of reinforcements from the allies. In their rear,\r\nmoreover, lay the guard of the Boeotians in the harbour. Thus they\r\npassed the whole day which followed the night of ingress without\r\nstriking a blow.\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"showed him the place in so straightforward a manner.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day, however, the Argive troops arrived in all haste,\r\nhurrying to the rescue, and found the enemy duly drawn up. The\r\nLacedaemonians were on their own right, the men of Sicyon next, and\r\nleaning against the eastern wall the Corinthian exiles, one hundred and\r\nfifty strong. (9) Their opponents marshalled their lines face to face in\r\ncorrespondence: Iphicrates with his mercenaries abutting on the eastern\r\nwall; next to them the Argives, whilst the Corinthians of the city held\r\ntheir left. In the pride inspired by numbers they began advancing at\r\nonce. They overpowered the Sicyonians, and tearing asunder the stockade,\r\npursued them to the sea and here slew numbers of them. At that instant\r\nPasimachus, the cavalry general, at the head of a handful of troopers,\r\nseeing the Sicyonians sore presed, made fast the horses of his troops to\r\nthe trees, and relieving the Sicyonians of their heavy infantry shields,\r\nadvanced with his volunteers against the Argives. The latter, seeing the\r\nSigmas on the shields and taking them to be \"Sicyonians,\" had not the\r\nslightest fear. Whereupon, as the story goes, Pasimachus, exclaiming\r\nin his broad Doric, \"By the twin gods! these Sigmas will cheat you,\r\nyou Argives,\" came to close quarters, and in that battle of a handful\r\nagainst a host, was slain himself with all his followers. In another\r\nquarter of the field, however, the Corinthian exiles had got the better\r\nof their opponents and worked their way up, so that they were now\r\ntouching the city circumvallation walls.\r\n\r\n (9) See Grote, ix. p. 333 foll.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians, on their side, perceiving the discomfiture of the\r\nSicyonians, sprang out with timely aid, keeping the palisade-work on\r\ntheir left. But the Argives, discovering that the Lacedaemonians were\r\nbehind them, wheeled round and came racing back, pouring out of the\r\npalisade at full speed. Their extreme right, with unprotected flanks\r\nexposed, fell victims to the Lacedaemonians; the rest, hugging the wall,\r\nmade good their retreat in dense masses towards the city. Here they\r\nencountered the Corinthian exiles, and discovering that they had fallen\r\nupon foes, swerved aside in the reverse direction. In this predicament\r\nsome mounted by the ladders of the city wall, and, leaping down from\r\nits summit, were destroyed; (10) others yielded up their lives, thrust\r\nthrough, as they jostled at the foot of the steps; others again were\r\nliterally trampled under one another's feet and suffocated.\r\n\r\n (10) Or, \"plunged from its summit into perdition.\" See Thuc. ii. 4.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians had no difficulty in the choice of victims; for at\r\nthat instant a work was assigned to them to do, (11) such as they could\r\nhardly have hoped or prayed for. To find delivered into their hands\r\na mob of helpless enemies, in an ecstasy of terror, presenting their\r\nunarmed sides in such sort that none turned to defend himself, but\r\neach victim rather seemed to contribute what he could towards his own\r\ndestruction--if that was not divine interposition, I know now what to\r\ncall it. Miracle or not, in that little space so many fell, and the\r\ncorpses lay piled so thick, that eyes familiar with the stacking of corn\r\nor wood or piles of stones were called upon to gaze at layers of human\r\nbodies. Nor did the guard of the Boeotians in the port itself (12)\r\nescape death; some were slain upon the ramparts, others on the roofs of\r\nthe dock-houses, which they had scaled for refuge. Nothing remained but\r\nfor the Corinthians and Argives to carry away their dead under cover of\r\na truce; whilst the allies of Lacedaemon poured in their reinforcements.\r\nWhen these were collected, Praxitas decided in the first place to raze\r\nenough of the walls to allow a free broadway for an army on march. This\r\ndone, he put himself at the head of his troops and advanced on the road\r\nto Megara, taking by assault, first Sidus and next Crommyon. Leaving\r\ngarrisons in these two fortresses, he retraced his steps, and finally\r\nfortifying Epieiceia as a garrison outpost to protect the territory\r\nof the allies, he at once disbanded his troops and himself withdrew to\r\nLacedaemon.\r\n\r\n (11) Or, \"Heaven assigned to them a work...\" Lit. \"The God...\"\r\n\r\n (12) I.e. \"of Lechaeum.\"\r\n\r\nB.C. 392-391. (13) After this the great armaments of both belligerents\r\nhad ceased to exist. The states merely furnished garrisons--the one\r\nset at Corinth, the other set at Sicyon--and were content to guard the\r\nwalls. Though even so, a vigorous war was carried on by dint of the\r\nmercenary troops with which both sides were furnished.\r\n\r\n (13) So Grote and Curtius; al. B.C. 393.\r\n\r\nA signal incident in the period was the invasion of Phlius by\r\nIphicrates. He laid an ambuscade, and with a small body of troops\r\nadopting a system of guerilla war, took occasion of an unguarded sally\r\nof the citizens of Phlius to inflict such losses on them, that though\r\nthey had never previously received the Lacedaemonians within their\r\nwalls, they received them now. They had hitherto feared to do so lest\r\nit might lead to the restoration of the banished members of\r\ntheir community, who gave out that they owed their exile to their\r\nLacedaemonian sympathies; (14) but they were now in such abject fear\r\nof the Corinthian party that they sent to fetch the Lacedaemonians,\r\nand delivered the city and citadel to their safe keeping. These latter,\r\nhowever, well disposed to the exiles of Phlius, did not, at the time\r\nthey held the city, so much as breathe the thought of bringing back the\r\nexiles; on the contrary, as soon as the city seemed to have recovered\r\nits confidence, they took their departure, leaving city and laws\r\nprecisely as they had found them on their entry.\r\n\r\n (14) Lit. \"laconism.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to Iphicrates and his men: they frequently extended their\r\nincursions even into Arcadia in many directions, (15) following their\r\nusual guerilla tactics, but also making assaults on fortified posts. The\r\nheavy infantry of the Arcadians positively refused to face them in the\r\nfield, so profound was the terror in which they held these light troops.\r\nIn compensation, the light troops themselves entertained a wholesome\r\ndread of the Lacedaemonians, and did not venture to approach even within\r\njavelin-range of their heavy infantry. They had been taught a lesson\r\nwhen, within that distance, some of the younger hoplites had made a dash\r\nat them, catching and putting some of them to the sword. But however\r\nprofound the contempt of the Lacedaemonians for these light troops,\r\ntheir contempt for their own allies was deeper. (On one occasion (16) a\r\nreinforcement of Mantineans had sallied from the walls between Corinth\r\nand Lechaeum to engage the peltasts, and had no sooner come under attack\r\nthan they swerved, losing some of their men as they made good their\r\nretreat. The Lacedaemonians were unkind enough to poke fun at these\r\nunfortunates. \"Our allies,\" they said, \"stand in as much awe of these\r\npeltasts as children of the bogies and hobgoblins of their nurses.\" For\r\nthemselves, starting from Lechaeum, they found no difficulty in marching\r\nright round the city of Corinth with a single Lacedaemonian division and\r\nthe Corinthian exiles.) (17)\r\n\r\n (15) See Thuc. ii. 4.\r\n\r\n (16) See Grote, ix. 472 note. Lechaeum was not taken by the\r\n    Lacedaemonians until the Corinthian long walls had been rebuilt by\r\n    the Athenians. Possibly the incidents in this section (S. 17)\r\n    occurred after the capture of Lechaeum. The historian introduces\r\n    them parenthetically, as it were, in illustration of his main\r\n    topic--the success of the peltasts.\r\n\r\n (17) Or, adopting Schneider's conjecture, {estratopedeuonto}, add \"and\r\n    encamping.\"\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, on their side, who felt the power of the Lacedaemonians\r\nto be dangerously close, now that the walls of Corinth had been laid\r\nopen, and even apprehended a direct attack upon themselves, determined\r\nto rebuild the portion of the wall severed by Praxitas. Accordingly\r\nthey set out with their whole force, including a suite of stonelayers,\r\nmasons, and carpenters, and within a few days erected a quite splendid\r\nwall on the side facing Sicyon towards the west, (18) and then proceeded\r\nwith more leisure to the completion of the eastern portion.\r\n\r\n (18) See Thuc. vi. 98.\r\n\r\nTo turn once more to the other side: the Lacedaemonians, indignant at\r\nthe notion that the Argives should be gathering the produce of their\r\nlands in peace at home, as if war were a pastime, marched against them.\r\nAgesilaus commanded the expedition, and after ravaging their territory\r\nfrom one end to the other, crossed their frontier at Tenea (19) and\r\nswooped down upon Corinth, taking the walls which had been lately\r\nrebuilt by the Athenians. He was supported on the sea side by his\r\nbrother Teleutias (20) with a naval force of about twelve triremes, and\r\nthe mother of both was able to congratulate herself on the joint success\r\nof both her sons; one having captured the enemy's walls by land and\r\nthe other his ships and naval arsenal by sea, on the same day. These\r\nachievements sufficed Agesilaus for the present; he disbanded the army\r\nof the allies and led the state troops home.\r\n\r\n (19) Reading {Tenean}, Koppen's emendation for {tegean}. In the\r\n    parallel passage (\"Ages.\" ii. 17) the text has {kata ta stena}.\r\n    See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 471.\r\n\r\n (20) See below, IV. viii. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nB.C. 390. (1) Subsequently the Lacedaemonians made a second expedition\r\nagainst Corinth. They heard from the exiles that the citizens contrived\r\nto preserve all their cattle in Peiraeum; indeed, large numbers derived\r\ntheir subsistence from the place. Agesilaus was again in command of the\r\nexpedition. In the first instance he advanced upon the Isthmus. It\r\nwas the month of the Isthmian games, (2) and here he found the Argives\r\nengaged in conducting the sacrifice to Poseidon, as if Corinth were\r\nArgos. So when they perceived the approach of Agesilaus, the Argives and\r\ntheir friends left the offerings as they lay, including the preparations\r\nfor the breakfast, and retired with undisguised alarm into the city\r\nby the Cenchrean road. (3) Agesilaus, though he observed the movement,\r\nrefrained from giving chase, but taking up his quarters in the temple,\r\nthere proceeded to offer victims to the god himself, and waited until\r\nthe Corinthian exiles had celebrated the sacrifice to Poseidon, along\r\nwith the games. But no sooner had Agesilaus turned his back and retired,\r\nthan the Argives returned and celebrated the Isthmian games afresh;\r\nso that in this particular year there were cases in which the same\r\ncompetitors were twice defeated in this or that contest, or conversely,\r\nthe same man was proclaimed victor twice over.\r\n\r\n (1) Al. B.C. 392. The historian omits the overtures for peace, B.C.\r\n    391 (or 391-390) referred to in Andoc. \"De Pace.\" See Jebb, \"Att.\r\n    Or.\" i. 83, 108; Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 474; Curtius, \"H. G.\" Eng. tr.\r\n    iv. 261.\r\n\r\n (2) Grote and Curtius believe these to be the Isthmian games of 390\r\n    B.C., not of 392 B.C., as Sauppe and others suppose. See Peter,\r\n    \"Chron. Table,\" p. 89, note 183; Jowett, \"Thuc.\" ii. 468, note on\r\n    VIII. 9, 1.\r\n\r\n (3) Lit. \"road to Cenchreae.\"\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day Agesilaus led his troops against Peiraeum, but finding\r\nit strongly defended, he made a sudden retrograde march after the\r\nmorning meal in the direction of the capital, as though he calculated on\r\nthe betrayal of the city. The Corinthians, in apprehension of some such\r\npossible catastrophe, sent to summon Iphicrates with the larger\r\nportion of his light infantry. These passed by duly in the night, not\r\nunobserved, however, by Agesilaus, who at once turned round at break of\r\nday and advanced on Piraeum. He himself kept to the low ground by the\r\nhot springs, (4) sending a division to scale the top of the pass. That\r\nnight he encamped at the hot springs, while the division bivouacked\r\nin the open, in possession of the pass. Here Agesilaus distinguished\r\nhimself by an invention as seasonable as it was simple. Among those\r\nwho carried provisions for the division not one had thought of bringing\r\nfire. The altitude was considerable; there had been a fall of rain and\r\nhail towards evening and the temperature was low; besides which, the\r\nscaling party were clad in thin garments suited to the summer season.\r\nThere they sat shivering in the dark, with scarcely heart to attack\r\ntheir suppers, when Agesilaus sent up to them as many as ten porters\r\ncarrying fire in earthen pots. One found his way up one way, one\r\nanother, and presently there were many bonfires blazing--magnificently\r\nenough, since there was plenty of wood to hand; so that all fell to\r\noiling themselves and many supped over again. The same night the sky was\r\nlit up by the blaze of the temple of Poseidon--set on fire no one knows\r\nhow.\r\n\r\n (4) Near mod. Lutraki.\r\n\r\nWhen the men in Piraeum perceived that the pass was occupied, they at\r\nonce abandoned all thought of self-defence and fled for refuge to the\r\nHeraion (5)--men and women, slaves and free-born, with the greater part\r\nof their flocks and herds. Agesilaus, with the main body, meanwhile\r\npursued his march by the sea-shore, and the division, simultaneously\r\ndescending from the heights, captured the fortified position of Oenoe,\r\nappropriating its contents. Indeed, all the troops on that day reaped\r\na rich harvest in the supplies they brought in from various farmsteads.\r\nPresently those who had escaped into the Heraion came out, offering to\r\nleave it to Agesilaus to decide what he would do with them. He decided\r\nto deliver up to the exiles all those concerned with the late butchery,\r\nand that all else should be sold. And so from the Heraion streamed out\r\na long line of prisoners, whilst from other sides embassies arrived in\r\nnumbers; and amongst these a deputation from the Boeotians, anxious to\r\nlearn what they should do to obtain peace. These latter Agesilaus,\r\nwith a certain loftiness of manner, affected not even to see, although\r\nPharax, (6) their proxenus, stood by their side to introduce them.\r\nSeated in a circular edifice on the margin of the lake, (7) he surveyed\r\nthe host of captives and valuables as they were brought out. Beside the\r\nprisoners, to guard them, stepped the Lacedaemonian warriors from the\r\ncamp, carrying their spears--and themselves plucked all gaze their way,\r\nso readily will success and the transient fortune of the moment rivet\r\nattention. But even while Agesilaus was still thus seated, wearing a\r\nlook betokening satisfaction at some great achievement, a horseman came\r\ngalloping up; the flanks of his charger streamed with sweat. To the many\r\ninquiries what news he brought, the rider responded never a word; but\r\nbeing now close beside Agesilaus, he leaped from his horse, and running\r\nup to him with lowering visage narrated the disaster of the Spartan\r\ndivision (8) at Lechaeum. At these tidings the king sprang instantly\r\nfrom his seat, clutching his spear, and bade his herald summon to a\r\nmeeting the generals, captains of fifties, and commanders of foreign\r\nbrigades. (9) When these had rapidly assembled he bade them, seeing that\r\nthe morning meal had not yet been tasted, to swallow hastily what they\r\ncould, and with all possible speed to overtake him. But for himself,\r\nhe, with the officers of the royal staff, (10) set off at once without\r\nbreakfast. His bodyguard, with their heavy arms, accompanied him with\r\nall speed--himself in advance, the officers following behind. In this\r\nfashion he had already passed beyond the warm springs, and was well\r\nwithin the plateau of Lechaeum, when three horsemen rode up with further\r\nnews: the dead bodies had been picked up. On receipt of these tidings\r\nhe commanded the troops to order arms, and having rested them a little\r\nspace, led them back again to the Heraion. The next day he spent in\r\ndisposing of the captured property.

The king\r\nanswered with a smile: \"I know your desire is not so much to see your\r\nsoldiers as to feast your eyes on the good fortune of your friends, and\r\nto measure its magnitude. Wait then, I will conduct you myself; with\r\nme you will be better able to discover the true value of what has taken\r\nplace.\" And he was as good as his word. Next day he sacrificed, and led\r\nhis army up to the gates of Corinth. The trophy he respected, but not\r\none tree did he leave standing--chopping and burning, as proof positive\r\nthat no one dared to face him in the field. And having so done, he\r\nencamped about Lechaeum; and as to the Theban ambassadors, in lieu\r\nof letting them pass into the city, he sent them off by sea across to\r\nCreusis.\r\n\r\nBut in proportion to the unwontedness of such a calamity befalling\r\nLacedaemonians, a widespread mourning fell upon the whole Laconian army,\r\nthose alone excepted whose sons or fathers or brothers had died at their\r\npost. The bearing of these resembled that of conquerors, (12) as with\r\nbright faces they moved freely to and fro, glorying in their domestic\r\nsorrow. Now the tragic fate which befell the division was on this wise:\r\nIt was the unvaried custom of the men of Amyclae to return home at\r\nthe Hyacinthia, (13) to join in the sacred paean, a custom not to be\r\ninterrupted by active service or absence from home or for any other\r\nreason. So, too, on this occasion, Agesilaus had left behind all the\r\nAmyclaeans serving in any part of his army at Lechaeum. At the right\r\nmoment the general in command of the garrison at that place had posted\r\nthe garrison troops of the allies to guard the walls during his absence,\r\nand put himself at the head of his division of heavy infantry with that\r\nof the cavalry, (14) and led the Amyclaeans past the walls of Corinth.\r\nArrived at a point within three miles or so (15) of Sicyon, the\r\npolemarch turned back himself in the direction of Lechaeum with his\r\nheavy infantry regiment, six hundred strong, giving orders to the\r\ncavalry commandant to escort the Amyclaeans with his division as far as\r\nthey required, and then to turn and overtake him. It cannot be said that\r\nthe Lacedaemonians were ignorant of the large number of light troops and\r\nheavy infantry inside Corinth, but owing to their former successes they\r\narrogantly presumed that no one would attack them. Within the capital\r\nof the Corinthians, however, their scant numbers--a thin line of heavy\r\ninfantry unsupported by light infantry or cavalry--had been noted; and\r\nCallias, the son of Hipponicus, (16) who was in command of the Athenian\r\nhoplites, and Iphicrates at the head of his peltasts, saw no risk in\r\nattacking with the light brigade. Since if the enemy continued his\r\nmarch by the high road, he would be cut up by showers of javelins on his\r\nexposed right flank; or if he were tempted to take the offensive, they\r\nwith their peltasts, the nimblest of all light troops, would easily slip\r\nout of the grasp of his hoplites.\r\n\r\n (12) See Grote, \"H.

(17)\r\nHere a man was wounded, and there another dropped, not to rise again.\r\nEach time orders were given to the attendant shield-bearers (18) to pick\r\nup the men and bear them into Lechaeum; and these indeed were the\r\nonly members of the mora who were, strictly speaking, saved. Then the\r\npolemarch ordered the ten-years-service men (19) to charge and drive off\r\ntheir assailants. Charge, however, as they might, they took nothing by\r\ntheir pains--not a man could they come at within javelin range. Being\r\nheavy infantry opposed to light troops, before they could get to close\r\nquarters the enemy's word of command sounded \"Retire!\" whilst as soon\r\nas their own ranks fell back, scattered as they were in consequence of\r\na charge where each man's individual speed had told, Iphicrates and his\r\nmen turned right about and renewed the javelin attack, while others,\r\nrunning alongside, harassed their exposed flank. At the very first\r\ncharge the assailants had shot down nine or ten, and, encouraged by\r\nthis success, pressed on with increasing audacity. These attacks told so\r\nseverely that the polemarch a second time gave the order (and this time\r\nfor the fifteen-years-service men) to charge. The order was promptly\r\nobeyed, but on retiring they lost more men than on the first occasion,\r\nand it was not until the pick and flower of the division had succumbed\r\nthat they were joined by their returning cavalry, in whose company they\r\nonce again attempted a charge. The light infantry gave way, but the\r\nattack of the cavalry was feebly enforced. Instead of pressing home the\r\ncharge until at least they had sabred some of the enemy, they kept their\r\nhorses abreast of their infantry skirmishers, (20) charging and wheeling\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\n (17) See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 467, note on the improvements of\r\n    Iphicrates.\r\n\r\n (18) Grote, \"H.

In desperation they massed compactly upon the narrow slope of\r\na hillock, distant a couple of furlongs (21) or so from the sea, and a\r\ncouple of miles (22) perhaps from Lechaeum. Their friends in Lechaeum,\r\nperceiving them, embarked in boats and sailed round until they were\r\nimmediately under the hillock. And now, in the very slough of despair,\r\nbeing so sorely troubled as man after man dropped dead, and unable\r\nto strike a blow, to crown their distress they saw the enemy's heavy\r\ninfantry advancing. Then they took to flight; some of them threw\r\nthemselves into the sea; others--a mere handful--escaped with the\r\ncavalry into Lechaeum. The death-roll, including those who fell in the\r\nsecond fight and the final flight, must have numbered two hundred and\r\nfifty slain, or thereabouts.

G.\" ix. 486.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, with the mutilated fragment of the division, Agesilaus\r\nturned his back upon Lechaeum, leaving another division behind to\r\ngarrison that port. On his passage homewards, as he wound his way\r\nthrough the various cities, he made a point of arriving at each as late\r\nin the day as possible, renewing his march as early as possible next\r\nmorning. Leaving Orchomenus at the first streak of dawn, he passed\r\nMantinea still under cover of darkness. The spectacle of the Mantineans\r\nrejoicing at their misfortune would have been too severe an ordeal for\r\nhis soldiers.\r\n\r\nBut Iphicrates had not yet reached the summit of his good fortune.\r\nSuccess followed upon success. Lacedaemonian garrisons had been placed\r\nin Sidus and Crommyon by Praxitas when he took these fortresses, and\r\nagain in Oenoe, when Peiraeum was taken quite lately by Agesilaus. One\r\nand all of these now fell into the hands of Iphicrates. Lechaeum still\r\nheld out, garrisoned as it was by the Lacedaemonians and their allies;\r\nwhile the Corinthian exiles, unable since (24) the disaster of the mora\r\nany longer to pass freely by land from Sicyon, had the sea passage still\r\nopen to them, and using Lechaeum as their base, (25) kept up a game of\r\nmutual annoyance with the party in the capital.\r\n\r\n (24) Lit. \"owing to.\"\r\n\r\n (25) The illustrative incidents narrated in chapter iv. 17 may belong\r\n    to this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nB.C. 390-389. (1) At a later date the Achaeans, being in possession of\r\nCalydon, a town from old times belonging to Aetolia, and having further\r\nincorporated the Calydonians as citizens, (2) were under the necessity\r\nof garrisoning their new possession. The reason was, that the\r\nArcarnanians were threatening the place with an army, and were aided\r\nby contingents from Athens and Boeotia, who were anxious to help their\r\nallies. (3) Under the strain of this combined attack the Achaeans\r\ndespatched ambassadors to Lacedaemon, who on arrival complained of the\r\nunfair conduct of Lacedaemon towards themselves. \"We, sirs,\" they said,\r\n\"are ever ready to serve in your armies, in obedience to whatever orders\r\nyou choose to issue; we follow you whithersoever you think fit to lead;\r\nbut when it comes to our being beleaguered by the Acarnanians, with\r\ntheir allies the Athenians and Boeotians, you show not the slightest\r\nconcern. Understand, then, that if things go on thus we cannot hold out;\r\nbut either we must give up all part in the war in Peloponnesus and cross\r\nover in full force to engage the Arcarnanians, or we must make peace\r\nwith them on whatever terms we can.\" This language was a tacit threat\r\nthat if they failed to obtain the assistance they felt entitled to from\r\nLacedaemon they would quit the alliance.\r\n\r\n (1) According to others (who suppose that the Isthmia and the events\r\n    recorded in chapter v. 1-19 above belong to B.C. 392), we have now\r\n    reached B.C. 391.\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"having conferred a city organisation on the Calydonians.\"\r\n\r\n (3) See Thuc. ii. 68.\r\n\r\nThe ephors and the assembly concluded that there was no alternative\r\nbut to assist the Achaeans in their campaign against the Acarnanians.\r\nAccordingly they sent out Agesilaus with two divisions and the proper\r\ncomplement of allies. The Achaeans none the less marched out in full\r\nforce themselves. No sooner had Agesilaus crossed the gulf than there\r\nwas a general flight of the population from the country districts into\r\nthe towns, whilst the flocks and herds were driven into remote districts\r\nthat they might not be captured by the troops. Being now arrived on\r\nthe frontier of the enemy's territory, Agesilaus sent to the general\r\nassembly of the Acarnanians at Stratus, (4) warning them that unless\r\nthey chose to give up their alliance with the Boeotians and Athenians,\r\nand to take instead themselves and their allies, he would ravage their\r\nterritory through its length and breadth, and not spare a single thing.\r\nWhen they turned a deaf ear to this summons, the other proceeded to do\r\nwhat he threatened, systematically laying the district waste, felling\r\nthe timber and cutting down the fruit-trees, while slowly moving on at\r\nthe rate of ten or twelve furlongs a day. The Acarnanians, owing to the\r\nsnail-like progress of the enemy, were lulled into a sense of security.\r\nThey even began bringing down their cattle from their alps, and devoted\r\nthemselves to the tillage of far the greater portion of their fields.\r\nBut Agesilaus only waited till their rash confidence reached its climax;\r\nthen on the fifteenth or sixteenth day after he had first entered the\r\ncountry he sacrificed at early dawn, and before evening had traversed\r\neighteen miles (5) or so of country to the lake (6) round which were\r\ncollected nearly all the flocks and herds of the Acarnanians, and so\r\ncaptured a vast quantity of cattle, horses, and grazing stock of all\r\nkinds, besides numerous slaves.\r\n\r\n (4) \"The Akarnanians had, in early times, occupied the hill of Olpai\r\n    as a place for judicial proceedings common to the whole nation\"\r\n    (see Thuc. iii. 105). \"But in Thucydides' own time Stratos had\r\n    attained its position as the greatest city of Akarnania, and\r\n    probably the Federal Assemblies were already held there\" (Thuc.\r\n    ii. 80). \"In the days of Agesilaos we find Stratos still more\r\n    distinctly marked as the place of Federal meeting.\"--Freeman,\r\n    \"Hist. Fed. Gov.\" ch. iv. p. 148 foll., \"On the constitution of\r\n    the League.\"\r\n\r\n (5) Lit. \"one hundred and sixty stades.\"\r\n\r\n (6) See Thuc. ii. 80; vi. 106.\r\n\r\nHaving secured this prize, he stayed on the spot the whole of the\r\nfollowing day, and devoted himself to disposing of the captured property\r\nby public sale. While he was thus engaged, a large body of Arcarnanian\r\nlight infantry appeared, and availing themselves of the position in\r\nwhich Agesilaus was encamped against the mountain side, assailed him\r\nwith volleys of sling-stones and rocks from the razor-edge of the\r\nmountain, without suffering any scathe themselves. By this means they\r\nsucceeded in dislodging and forcing his troops down into the level\r\nplain, and that too at an hour when the whole camp was engaged in\r\npreparations for the evening meal. As night drew on, the Acarnanians\r\nretired; sentinels were posted, and the troops slept in peace.\r\n\r\nNext day Agesilaus led off his army. The exit from the plain and\r\nmeadow-land round the lake was a narrow aperture through a close\r\nencircling range of hills. In occupation of this mountain barrier the\r\nAcarnanians, from the vantage-ground above, poured down a continuous\r\npelt of stones and other missiles, or, creeping down to the fringes,\r\ndogged and annoyed them so much that the army was no longer able to\r\nproceed. If the heavy infantry or cavalry made sallies from the main\r\nline they did no harm to their assailants, for the Acarnanians had only\r\nto retire and they had quickly gained their strongholds. It was too\r\nsevere a task, Agesilaus thought, to force his way through the narrow\r\npass so sorely beset. He made up his mind, therefore, to charge that\r\nportion of the enemy who dogged his left, though these were pretty\r\nnumerous. The range of hills on this side was more accessible to heavy\r\ninfantry and horse alike. During the interval needed for the inspection\r\nof victims, the Acarnanians kept plying them with javelins and bullets,\r\nand, coming into close proximity, wounded man after man. But presently\r\ncame the word of command, \"Advance!\" and the fifteen-years-service men\r\nof the heavy infantry (7) ran forward, accompanied by the cavalry, at a\r\nround pace, the general himself steadily following with the rest of the\r\ncolumn. Those of the Acarnanians who had crept down the mountain side at\r\nthat instant in the midst of their sharpshooting turned and fled, and as\r\nthey climbed the steep, man after man was slain. When, however, the top\r\nof the pass was reached, there stood the hoplites of the Acarnanians\r\ndrawn up in battle line, and supported by the mass of their light\r\ninfantry. There they steadily waited, keeping up a continuous discharge\r\nof missiles the while, or launching their long spears; whereby they\r\ndealt wounds to the cavalry troopers and death in some cases to the\r\nhorses. But when they were all but within the clutches of the advancing\r\nheavy infantry (8) of the Lacedaemonians their firmness forsook them;\r\nthey swerved and fled, and there died of them on that day about three\r\nhundred. So ended the affair.\r\n\r\n (7) I.e. \"the first two ranks.\" See above, IV. v. 14.\r\n\r\n (8) See \"Ages.\" ii. 20, for an extraordinary discrepancy.\r\n\r\nAgesilaus set up a trophy of victory, and afterwards making a tour of\r\nthe country, he visited it with fire and sword. (9) Occasionally, in\r\nobedience to pressure put upon him by the Achaeans, he would assault\r\nsome city, but did not capture a single one. And now, as the season of\r\nautumn rapidly approached, he prepared to leave the country; whereupon\r\nthe Achaeans, who looked upon his exploits as abortive, seeing that not\r\na single city, willingly or unwillingly, had as yet been detached from\r\ntheir opponents, begged him, as the smallest service he could render\r\nthem, at any rate to stay long enough in the country to prevent the\r\nAcarnanians from sowing their corn. He answered that the course they\r\nsuggested ran counter to expediency. \"You forget,\" he said, \"that I mean\r\nto invade your enemies again next summer; and therefore the larger their\r\nsowing now, the stronger will be their appetite for peace hereafter.\"\r\nWith this retort he withdrew overland through Aetolia, and by roads,\r\nmoreover, which no army, small or great, could possibly have traversed\r\nwithout the consent of the inhabitants. The Aetolians, however, were\r\nonly too glad to yield the Spartan king a free passage, cherishing hopes\r\nas they did that he would aid them to recover Naupactus. On reaching\r\nRhium (10) he crossed the gulf at that point and returned homewards,\r\nthe more direct passage from Calydon to Peloponnesus being effectually\r\nbarred by an Athenian squadron stationed at Oeniadae.\r\n\r\n (9) Or lit. \"burning and felling.\"\r\n\r\n (10) Or Antirrhium (as more commonly called).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nB.C. 389-388. (1) On the expiration of winter, and in fulfilment of his\r\npromise to the Achaeans, Agesilaus called out the ban once more with\r\nearly spring to invade the Acarnanians. The latter were apprised of his\r\nintention, and, being persuaded that owing to the midland situation of\r\ntheir cities they would just as truly be blockaded by an enemy who chose\r\nto destroy their corn as they would be if besieged with entrenchments in\r\nregular form, they sent ambassadors to Lacedaemon, and made peace with\r\nthe Achaeans and alliance with the Lacedaemonians. Thus closes this page\r\nof history concerning the affairs of Arcarnania.\r\n\r\n (1) According to others, B.C. 390.\r\n\r\nTo turn to the next. There was a feeling on the part of the\r\nLacedaemonians (2) that no expedition against Athens or Boeotia would be\r\nsafe so long as a state so important and so close to their own frontier\r\nas Argos remained in open hostility behind them. Accordingly they called\r\nout the ban against Argos. Now when Agesipolis learnt that the duty of\r\nleadership devolved on him, and, moreover, that the sacrifices before\r\ncrossing the frontier were favourable, he went to Olympia and consulted\r\nthe will of the god. \"Would it be lawful to him,\" he inquired, \"not to\r\naccept the holy truce, on the ground that the Argives made the season\r\nfor it (3) depend not on a fixed date, but on the prospect of a\r\nLacedaemonian invasion?\" The god indicated to the inquirer that he might\r\nlawfully repudiate any holy truce which was fraudulently antedated. (4)\r\nNot content with this, the young king, on leaving Olympia, went at once\r\nto Delphi, and at that shrine put the same question to Apollo: \"Were his\r\nviews in accordance with his Father's as touching the holy truce?\"--to\r\nwhich the son of Zeus made answer: \"Yea, altogether in accordance.\" (5)\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"It was agreed by the Lacedaemonians.\"\r\n\r\n (3) I.e. \"the season of the Carneia.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"wrongfully put forward.\" See below, V. i. 29; iii. 28; Paus.\r\n    III. v. 8; Jebb. \"Att. Or.\" i. p. 131; Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 494\r\n    foll.; Jowett, \"Thuc.\" ii. 315; note to Thuc. V. liv. 3.\r\n\r\n (5) Grote; cf. Aristot. \"Rhet.\" ii. 33.\r\n\r\nThen without further hesitation, picking up his army at Phlius\r\n(where, during his absence to visit the temples, the troops had been\r\ncollecting), he advanced by Nemea into the enemy's territory. The\r\nArgives, on their side, perceiving that they would be unable to hinder\r\nhis advance, in accordance with their custom sent a couple of heralds,\r\ngarlanded, and presented their usual plea of a holy truce. Agesipolis\r\nanswered them curtly that the gods were not satisfied with the justice\r\nof their plea, and, refusing to accept the truce, pushed forward,\r\ncausing thereby great perplexity and consternation throughout the rural\r\ndistricts and the capital itself.\r\n\r\nBut while he was getting his evening meal that first evening in the\r\nArgive territory--just at the moment when the after-dinner libation had\r\nbeen poured out--the god sent an earthquake; and with one consent the\r\nLacedaemonians, beginning with the officers of the royal quarters,\r\nsang the sacred hymn of Poseidon. The soldiers, in general, expected to\r\nretreat, arguing that, on the occurrence of an earthquake once before,\r\nAgis had retired from Elis. But Agesipolis held another view: if the god\r\nhad sent his earthquake at the moment when he was meditating invasion,\r\nhe should have understood that the god forbade his entrance; but now,\r\nwhen the invasion was a thing effected, he must needs take it as a\r\nsignal of his approval. (6) Accordingly next morning he sacrificed to\r\nPoseidon, and advanced a short distance further into the country.\r\n\r\n (6) Or, \"interpret the signal as a summons to advance.\"\r\n\r\nThe late expedition of Agesilaus into Argos (7) was still fresh in men's\r\nminds, and Agesipolis was eager to ascertain from the soldiers how close\r\nhis predecessor had advanced to the fortification walls; or again, how\r\nfar he had gone in ravaging the open country--not unlike a competitor\r\nin the pentathlon, (8) eager to cap the performance of his rival in each\r\nevent. On one occasion it was only the discharge of missiles from the\r\ntowers which forced him to recross the trenches round the walls; on\r\nanother, profiting by the absence of the majority of the Argives in\r\nLaconian territory, he came so close to the gates that their officers\r\nactually shut out their own Boeotian cavalry on the point of entering,\r\nin terror lest the Lacedaemonians might pour into the town in company,\r\nand these Boeotian troopers were forced to cling, like bats to a wall,\r\nunder each coign of vantage beneath the battlements. Had it not been for\r\nthe accidental absence of the Cretans, (9) who had gone off on a raid to\r\nNauplia, without a doubt numbers of men and horses would have been\r\nshot down. At a later date, while encamping in the neighbourhood of the\r\nEnclosures, (10) a thunder-bolt fell into his camp. One or two men were\r\nstruck, while others died from the effect of the concussion on their\r\nbrains. At a still later period he was anxious to fortify some sort of\r\ngarrison outpost in the pass of Celusa, (11) but upon offering sacrifice\r\nthe victims proved lobeless, (12) and he was constrained to lead back\r\nand disband his army--not without serious injury inflicted on the\r\nArgives, as the result of an invasion which had taken them wholly by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n (7) See above, \"Hell.\" IV. iv. 19.\r\n\r\n (8) The pentathlon of Olympia and the other great games consisted of\r\n    five contests, in the following order--(1) leaping, (2) discus-\r\n    throwing, (3) javelin-throwing, (4) running, (5) wrestling. Cf.\r\n    Simonides, {alma podokeien diskon akonta palen}, where, \"metri\r\n    gratia,\" the order is inverted. The competitors were drawn in\r\n    pairs. The odd man who drew a bye in any particular round or heat\r\n    was called the \"ephedros.\" The successful athletes of the pairs,\r\n    that is, those who had won any three events out of five, would\r\n    then again be drawn against each other, and so on until only two\r\n    were left, between whom the final heat took place. See, for an\r\n    exhaustive discussion of the subject, Prof. Percy Gardner, \"The\r\n    Pentathlon of the Greeks\" (\"Journal of Hellenic Studies,\" vol. i.\r\n    9, p. 210 foll. pl. viii.), from whom this note is taken.\r\n\r\n (9) See Thuc. vii. 57.\r\n\r\n (10) {peri tas eirktas}--what these were no one knows, possibly a\r\n    stone quarry used as a prison.

Meanwhile another\r\nseries of events was being enacted on the sea and within the seaboard\r\ncities; and these I will now narrate in detail. But I shall confine my\r\npen to the more memorable incidents, and others of less account I shall\r\npass over.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, Pharnabazus and Conon, after defeating the\r\nLacedaemonians in the naval engagement of Cnidus, commenced a tour of\r\ninspection round the islands and the maritime states, expelling from\r\nthem, as they visited them, one after another the Spartan governors. (1)\r\nEverywhere they gave consolatory assurances to the citizens that they\r\nhad no intention of establishing fortress citadels within their walls,\r\nor in any way interfering with their self-government. (2) Such words\r\nfell soothingly upon the ears of those to whom they were addressed;\r\nthe proposals were courteously accepted; all were eager to present\r\nPharnabazus with gifts of friendship and hospitality. The satrap,\r\nindeed, was only applying the instructions of his master Conon on these\r\nmatters--who had taught him that if he acted thus all the states would\r\nbe friendly to him, whereas, if he showed any intention to enslave them,\r\nthe smallest of them would, as Conon insisted, be capable of causing\r\na world of trouble, and the chances were, if apprehensions were once\r\nexcited, he would find himself face to face with a coalition of united\r\nHellas. To these admonitions Pharnabazus lent a willing ear.\r\n\r\n (1) Lit. \"the Laconian harmosts.\"\r\n\r\n (2) See Hicks, 70, \"Honours to Konon,\" Inscript. found at Erythrae in\r\n    Ionia. Cf. Diod. xiv. 84.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when disembarking at Ephesus, he presented Conon with a\r\nfleet of forty sail, (3) and having further instructed him to meet him\r\nat Sestos, (4) set off himself by land along the coast to visit his own\r\nprovinces. For here it should be mentioned that his old enemy Dercylidas\r\nhappened to be in Abydos at the time of the sea-fight; (5) nor had he at\r\na later date suffered eclipse with the other governors, (6) but on\r\nthe contrary, had kept tight hold of Abydos and still preserved it in\r\nattachment to Lacedaemon. The course he had adopted was to summon a\r\nmeeting of the Abydenians, when he made them a speech as follows: \"Sirs,\r\nto-day it is possible for you, who have before been friends to my city,\r\nto appear as benefactors of the Lacedaemonians. For a man to prove\r\nfaithful to his friends in the heyday of their good fortune is no great\r\nmarvel; but to prove steadfast when his friends are in misfortune--that\r\nis a service monumental for all time. But do not mistake me. It does not\r\nfollow that, because we have been defeated in a great sea-fight, we are\r\ntherefore annihilated. (7) Certainly not. Even in old days, you will\r\nadmit, when Athens was mistress of the sea, our state was not powerless\r\nto benefit friends or chastise enemies. Moreover, in proportion as the\r\nrest of the cities have joined hands with fortune to turn their backs\r\nupon us, so much the more certainly will the grandeur of your fidelity\r\nshine forth. Or, is any one haunted by the fear that we may find\r\nourselves blockaded by land and sea?--let him consider that at present\r\nthere is no Hellenic navy whatever on the seas, and if the barbarian\r\nattempts to clutch the empire of the sea, Hellas will not sit by and\r\nsuffer it; so that, if only in self-defence, she must inevitably take\r\nyour side.\"\r\n\r\n (3) See Diod. xiv. 83.\r\n\r\n (4) See above, \"Hell.\" II. i. 27 foll.\r\n\r\n (5) See above, \"Hell.\" IV. iii. 3.\r\n\r\n (6) Lit. \"harmosts.\"\r\n\r\n (7) Or, \"we are beaten, ergo, it is all over with us.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Abydenians lent no deaf ears, but rather responded with\r\nwillingness approaching enthusiasm--extending the hand of fellowship\r\nto the ex-governors, some of whom were already flocking to Abydos as a\r\nharbour of refuge, whilst others they sent to summon from a distance.\r\n\r\nSo when a number of efficient and serviceable men had been collected,\r\nDercylidas ventured to cross over to Sestos--lying, as it does, not more\r\nthan a mile (8) distant, directly facing Abydos. There he not only\r\nset about collecting those who held lands in the Chersonese through\r\nLacedaemonian influence, but extended his welcome also to the governors\r\n(9) who had been driven out of European states. (10) He insisted\r\nthat, if they came to think of it, not even was their case desperate,\r\nreminding them that even in Asia, which originally belonged to the\r\nPersian monarch, places were to be found--such as the little state of\r\nTemnos, or Aegae, and others, capable of administering their affairs,\r\nunsubjected to the king of Persia. \"But,\" he added, \"if you want a\r\nstrong impregnable position, I cannot conceive what better you can find\r\nthan Sestos. Why, it would need a combined naval and military force to\r\ninvest that port.\" By these and such like arguments he rescued them from\r\nthe lethargy of despair.\r\n\r\n (8) Lit. \"eight stades.\"\r\n\r\n (9) Lit. \"harmosts.\"\r\n\r\n (10) See Demos. \"de Cor.\" 96.\r\n\r\nNow when Pharnabazus found Abydos and Sestos so conditioned, he gave\r\nthem to understand that unless they chose to eject the Lacedaemonians,\r\nhe would bring war to bear upon them; and when they refused to obey,\r\nhaving first assigned to Conon as his business to keep the sea closed\r\nagainst them, he proceeded in person to ravage the territory of the men\r\nof Abydos. Presently, finding himself no nearer the fulfilment of his\r\nobject--which was their reduction--he set off home himself and left it\r\nto Conon the while so to conciliate the Hellespontine states that as\r\nlarge a naval power as possible might be mustered against the coming\r\nspring. In his wrath against the Lacedaemonians, in return for the\r\ntreatment he had received from them, his paramount object was to invade\r\ntheir territory and exact what vengeance he could.\r\n\r\nB.C. 393. The winter was thus fully taken up with preparations; but with\r\nthe approach of spring, Pharnabazus and Conon, with a large fleet fully\r\nmanned, and a foreign mercenary brigade to boot, threaded their way\r\nthrough the islands to Melos. (11) This island was to serve as a base of\r\noperations against Lacedaemon. And in the first instance he sailed down\r\nto Pherae (12) and ravaged that district, after which he made successive\r\ndescents at various other points on the seaboard, and did what injury\r\nhe could. But in apprehension of the harbourless character of the coast,\r\ncoupled with the enemy's facility of reinforcement and his own scarcity\r\nof supplies, he very soon turned back and sailed away, until finally he\r\ncame to moorings in the harbour of Phoenicus in Cythera. The occupants\r\nof the city of the Cytherians, in terror of being taken by storm,\r\nevacuated the walls. To dismiss these under a flag of truce across to\r\nLaconia was his first step; his second was to repair the fortress\r\nin question and to leave a garrison in the island under an Athenian\r\ngovernor--Nicophemus. After this he set sail to the Isthmus of Corinth,\r\nwhere he delivered an exhortation to the allies begging them to\r\nprosecute the war vigorously, and to show themselves faithful to the\r\nGreat King; and so, having left them all the moneys he had with him, set\r\noff on his voyage home.\r\n\r\n (11) See Lys. xix. \"de bon. Arist.\" 19 foll.; and Hicks, 71, \"Honours\r\n    to Dionysios I. and his court\"; Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 453.\r\n\r\n (12) Mod. Kalamata.\r\n\r\nBut Conon had a proposal to make:--If Pharnabazus would allow him to\r\nkeep the fleet, he would undertake, in the first place, to support it\r\nfree of expense from the islands; besides which, he would sail to his\r\nown country and help his fellow-citizens the Athenians to rebuild their\r\nlong walls and the fortifications round Piraeus. No heavier blow, he\r\ninsisted, could well be inflicted on Lacedaemon. \"In this way, I can\r\nassure you,\" he added, \"you will win the eternal gratitude of the\r\nAthenians and wreak consummate vengeance on the Lacedaemonians, since\r\nat one stroke you will render null and void that on which they have\r\nbestowed their utmost labour.\" These arguments so far weighed with\r\nPharnabazus that he despatched Conon to Athens with alacrity, and\r\nfurther supplied him with funds for the restoration of the walls. Thus\r\nit was that Conon, on his arrival at Athens, was able to rebuild a large\r\nportion of the walls--partly by lending his own crews, and partly by\r\ngiving pay to carpenters and stone-masons, and meeting all the necessary\r\nexpenses. There were other portions of the walls which the Athenians and\r\nBoeotians and other states raised as a joint voluntary undertaking.\r\n\r\nNor must it be forgotten that the Corinthians, with the funds left them\r\nby Pharnabazus, manned a fleet--the command of which they entrusted\r\nto their admiral Agathinus--and so were undisputed masters of the sea\r\nwithin the gulf round Achaia and Lechaeum.\r\n\r\nB.C. 393-391. The Lacedaemonians, in opposition, fitted out a fleet\r\nunder the command of Podanemus. That officer, in an attack of no great\r\nmoment, lost his life, and Pollis, (13) his second in command, was\r\npresently in his turn obliged to retire, being wounded, whereupon\r\nHerippidas took command of the vessels. On the other hand, Proaenus\r\nthe Corinthian, who had relieved Agathinus, evacuated Rhium, and the\r\nLacedaemonians recovered that post. Subsequently Teleutias succeeded to\r\nHerippidas's fleet, and it was then the turn of that admiral to dominate\r\nthe gulf. (14)\r\n\r\n (13) See \"Hell.\" I. i. 23.\r\n\r\n (14) According to Grote (\"H. G.\" ix. 471, note 2), this section\r\n    summarises the Lacedaemonian maritime operations in the Corinthian\r\n    Gulf from the late autumn of 393 B.C. till the appointment of\r\n    Teleutias in the spring or early summer of 391 B.C., the year of\r\n    the expedition of Agesilaus recounted above, \"Hell.\" IV. iv. 19.\r\n\r\nB.C. 392. The Lacedaemonians were well informed of the proceedings of\r\nConon. They knew that he was not only restoring the fortifications\r\nof Athens by help of the king's gold, but maintaining a fleet at his\r\nexpense besides, and conciliating the islands and seaboard cities\r\ntowards Athens. If, therefore, they could indoctrinate Tiribazus--who\r\nwas a general of the king--with their sentiments, they believed they\r\ncould not fail either to draw him aside to their own interests, or, at\r\nany rate, to put a stop to his feeding Conon's navy. With this intention\r\nthey sent Antalcidas to Tiribazus: (15) his orders were to carry out\r\nthis policy and, if possible, to arrange a peace between Lacedaemon and\r\nthe king. The Athenians, getting wind of this, sent a counter-embassy,\r\nconsisting of Hermogenes, Dion, Callisthenes, and Callimedon, with Conon\r\nhimself. They at the same time invited the attendance of ambassadors\r\nfrom the allies, and there were also present representatives of the\r\nBoeotians, of Corinth, and of Argos. When they had arrived at their\r\ndestination, Antalcidas explained to Tiribazus the object of his\r\nvisit: he wished, if possible, to cement a peace between the state\r\nhe represented and the king--a peace, moreover, exactly suited to the\r\naspirations of the king himself; in other words, the Lacedaemonians gave\r\nup all claim to the Hellenic cities in Asia as against the king, while\r\nfor their own part they were content that all the islands and other\r\ncities should be independent. \"Such being our unbiased wishes,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"for what earthly reason should (the Hellenes or) the king\r\ngo to war with us? or why should he expend his money? The king is\r\nguaranteed against attack on the part of Hellas, since the Athenians are\r\npowerless apart from our hegemony, and we are powerless so long as the\r\nseparate states are independent.\" The proposals of Antalcidas sounded\r\nvery pleasantly in the ears of Tiribazus, but to the opponents of\r\nSparta they were the merest talk. The Athenians were apprehensive of\r\nan agreement which provided for the independence of the cities in the\r\nislands, whereby they might be deprived of Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros.\r\nThe Thebans, again, were afraid of being compelled to let the Boeotian\r\nstates go free. The Argives did not see how such treaty contracts\r\nand covenants were compatible with the realisation of their own great\r\nobject--the absorption of Corinth by Argos. And so it came to pass that\r\nthis peace (16) proved abortive, and the representatives departed each\r\nto his own home.\r\n\r\n (15) See Plut. \"Ages.\" xxiii. (Clough, iv. p. 27); and for the date\r\n    B.C. 392 (al. B.C. 393) see Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 498.\r\n\r\n (16) See Andoc. \"de Pace\"; Jebb, \"Attic Or.\" i. 83, 128 foll. Prof.\r\n    Jebb assigns this speech to B.C. 390 rather than B.C. 391. See\r\n    also Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 499; Diod. xiv. 110.\r\n\r\nTiribazus, on his side, thought it hardly consistent with his own safety\r\nto adopt the cause of the Lacedaemonians without the concurrence of\r\nthe king--a scruple which did not prevent him from privately presenting\r\nAntalcidas with a sum of money, in hopes that when the Athenians and\r\ntheir allies discovered that the Lacedaemonians had the wherewithal to\r\nfurnish a fleet, they might perhaps be more disposed to desire peace.\r\nFurther, accepting the statements of the Lacedaemonians as true, he\r\ntook on himself to secure the person of Conon, as guilty of wrongdoing\r\ntowards the king, and shut him up. (17) That done, he set off up\r\ncountry to the king to recount the proposals of Lacedaemon, with his own\r\nsubsequent capture of Conon as a mischievous man, and to ask for further\r\nguidance on all these matters.\r\n\r\n (17) See Diod. xiv. 85; and Corn. Nep. 5.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Tiribazus at the palace, the king sent down Struthas\r\nto take charge of the seaboard district. The latter, however, was a\r\nstrong partisan of Athens and her allies, since he found it impossible\r\nto forget the long list of evils which the king's country had suffered\r\nat the hands of Agesilaus; so that the Lacedaemonians, contrasting\r\nthe hostile disposition of the new satrap towards themselves with his\r\nfriendliness to the Athenians, sent Thibron to deal with him by force of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nB.C. 391. (18) That general crossed over and established his base\r\nof operations in Ephesus and the towns in the plain of the\r\nMaeander--Priene, Leucophrys, and Achilleum--and proceeded to harry the\r\nking's territory, sparing neither live nor dead chattels. But as time\r\nwent on, Struthas, who could not but note the disorderly, and indeed\r\nrecklessly scornful manner in which the Lacedaemonian brought up his\r\nsupports on each occasion, despatched a body of cavalry into the plain.\r\nTheir orders were to gallop down and scour the plain, making a clean\r\nsweep (19) of all they could lay their hands on. Thibron, as it\r\nbefell, had just finished breakfast, and was returning to the mess\r\nwith Thersander the flute-player. The latter was not only a good\r\nflute-player, but, as affecting Lacedaemonian manners, laid claim to\r\npersonal prowess. Struthas, then, seeing the disorderly advance of the\r\nsupports and the paucity of the vanguard, appeared suddenly at the head\r\nof a large body of cavalry, all in orderly array. Thibron and Thersander\r\nwere the first to be cut down, and when these had fallen the rest of the\r\ntroops were easily turned. A mere chase ensued, in which man after\r\nman was felled to earth, though a remnant contrived to escape into the\r\nfriendly cities; still larger numbers owed their safety to their late\r\ndiscovery of the business on hand. Nor, indeed, was this the first time\r\nthe Spartan commander had rushed to the field, without even issuing a\r\ngeneral order. So ends the history of these events.\r\n\r\n (18) Al. B.C. 392, al. B.C. 390.\r\n\r\n (19) See \"Hell.\" VII. i. 40; \"Cyrop.\" I. iv. 17; III. iii. 23; \"Anab.\"\r\n    VI. iii. 3.\r\n\r\nB.C. 390. (20) We pass on to the arrival at Lacedaemon of a party of\r\nRhodian exiles expelled by the popular party. They insisted that it was\r\nnot equitable to allow the Athenians to subjugate Rhodes and thus build\r\nup so vast a power. The Lacedaemonians were alive to the fact that the\r\nfate of Rhodes depended on which party in the state prevailed: if the\r\ndemocracy were to dominate, the whole island must fall into the hands of\r\nAthens; if the wealthier classes, (21) into their own. Accordingly they\r\nfitted out for them a fleet of eight vessels, and put Ecdicus in command\r\nof it as admiral.\r\n\r\n (20) Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 504; al. B.C. 391.\r\n\r\n (21) Or, \"the Lacedaemonians were not slow to perceive that the whole\r\n    island of Rhodes was destined to fall either into the hands of\r\n    Athens or of themselves, according as the democracy or the\r\n    wealthier classes respectively dominated.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time they despatched another officer on board these vessels\r\nnamed Diphridas, on a separate mission. His orders were to cross over\r\ninto Asia and to secure the states which had received Thibron. He was\r\nalso to pick up the survivors of Thibron's army, and with these troops,\r\naided by a second army which he would collect from any other quarter\r\nopen to him, he was to prosecute the war against Struthas. Diphridas\r\nfollowed out his instructions, and amongst other achievements was\r\nfortunate enough to capture Tigranes, (22) the son-in-law of Struthas,\r\nwith his wife, on their road to Sardis. The sum paid for their ransom\r\nwas so large that he at once had the wherewithal to pay his mercenaries.\r\nDiphridas was no less attractive than his predecessor Thibron; but\r\nhe was of a more orderly temperament, steadier, and incomparably more\r\nenterprising as a general; the secret of this superiority being that\r\nhe was a man over whom the pleasures of the body exercised no sway. He\r\nbecame readily absorbed in the business before him--whatever he had to\r\ndo he did it with a will.\r\n\r\n (22) See \"Anab.\" VII. viii. 9 for a similar exploit.\r\n\r\nEcdicus having reached Cnidus, there learned that the democracy in\r\nRhones were entirely masters of the situation. They were dominant by\r\nland and sea; indeed they possessed a fleet twice the size of his\r\nown. He was therefore content to keep quiet in Cnidus until the\r\nLacedaemonians, perceiving that his force was too small to allow him to\r\nbenefit their friends, determined to relieve him. With this view they\r\nordered Teleutias to take the twelve ships which formed his squadron (at\r\npresent in the gulf adjoining Achaia and Lechaeum), (23) and to feel his\r\nway round to Ecdicus: that officer he was to send home. For himself, he\r\nwas to undertake personally to protect the interests of all who cared to\r\nbe their friends, whilst injuring the enemy by every possible means.\r\n\r\n (23) See above, IV. viii. 11.\r\n\r\nSo then Teleutias, having reached Samos, where he added some vessels to\r\nhis fleet, set sail to Cnidus. At this point Ecdicus returned home, and\r\nTeleutias, continuing his voyage, reached Rhodes, at the head now of\r\nseven-and-twenty vessels. It was during this portion of the voyage that\r\nhe fell in with Philocrates, the son of Ephialtes, who was sailing from\r\nAthens to Cyprus with ten triremes, in aid of their ally Evagoras. (24)\r\nThe whole flotilla fell into the Spartan's hands--a curious instance, it\r\nmay be added, of cross purposes on the part of both belligerents. Here\r\nwere the Athenians, supposed to be on friendly terms with the king,\r\nengaged in sending an allied force to support Evagoras, who was at open\r\nwar with him; and here again was Teleutias, the representative of a\r\npeople at war with Persia, engaged in crippling a fleet which had been\r\ndespatched on a mission hostile to their adversary. Teleutias put\r\nback into Cnidus to dispose of his captives, and so eventually reached\r\nRhodes, where his arrival brought timely aid to the party in favour of\r\nLacedaemon.\r\n\r\n (24) See Diod. xiv. 98; Hicks, 72; Kohler, \"C. I. A.\" ii. p. 397;\r\n    Isoc. \"Evag.\" 54-57; Paus. I. iii. 1; Lys. \"de bon. Ar.\" 20; Dem.\r\n    p. 161.\r\n\r\nB.C. 389. (25) And now the Athenians, fully impressed with the belief\r\nthat their rivals were laying the basis of a new naval supremacy,\r\ndespatched Thrasybulus the Steirian to check them, with a fleet of forty\r\nsail. That officer set sail, but abstained from bringing aid to Rhodes,\r\nand for good reasons. In Rhodes the Lacedaemonian party had hold of\r\nthe fortress, and would be out of reach of his attack, especially as\r\nTeleutias was close at hand to aid them with his fleet. On the other\r\nhand, his own friends ran no danger of succumbing to the enemy, as\r\nthey held the cities and were numerically much stronger, and they had\r\nestablished their superiority in the field. Consequently he made for\r\nthe Hellespont, where, in the absence of any rival power, he hoped to\r\nachieve some stroke of good fortune for his city. Thus, in the first\r\nplace, having detected the rivalries existing between Medocus, (26)\r\nthe king of the Odrysians, and Seuthes, (27) the rival ruler of the\r\nseaboard, he reconciled them to each other, and made them friends and\r\nallies of Athens; in the belief that if he secured their friendship the\r\nHellenic cities on the Thracian coast would show greater proclivity to\r\nAthens. Such being the happy state of affairs not only in Europe but as\r\nregards the states in Asia also, thanks to the friendly attitude of\r\nthe king to his fellow-citizens, he sailed into Byzantium and sold the\r\ntithe-duty levied on vessels arriving from the Euxine. By another stroke\r\nhe converted the oligarchy of Byzantium into a democracy. The result of\r\nthis was that the Byzantine demos (28) were no longer sorry to see as\r\nvast a concourse of Athenians in their city as possible. Having so done,\r\nand having further won the friendship of the men of Calchedon, he set\r\nsail south of the Hellespont. Arrived at Lesbos, he found all the cities\r\ndevoted to Lacedaemon with the exception of Mytilene. He was therefore\r\nloth to attack any of the former until he had organised a force within\r\nthe latter. This force consisted of four hundred hoplites, furnished\r\nfrom his own vessels, and a corps of exiles from the different\r\ncities who had sought shelter in Mytilene; to which he added a stout\r\ncontingent, the pick of the Mytileneian citizens themselves. He stirred\r\nthe ardour of the several contingents by suitable appeals: representing\r\nto the men of Mytilene that by their capture of the cities they would at\r\nonce become the chiefs and patrons of Lesbos; to the exiles he made it\r\nappear that if they would but unite to attack each several city in turn,\r\nthey might all reckon on their particular restoration; while he needed\r\nonly to remind his own warriors that the acquisition of Lesbos meant not\r\nonly the attachment of a friendly city, but the discovery of a mine\r\nof wealth. The exhortations ended and the contingents organised, he\r\nadvanced against Methymna.\r\n\r\n (25) Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 507.\r\n\r\n (26) Al.

A battle was fought\r\nand Therimachus was slain, a fate shared by several of the exiles of his\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAs a result (29) of his victory the Athenian general succeeded in\r\nwinning the adhesion of some of the states; or, where adhesion\r\nwas refused, he could at least raise supplies for his soldiers by\r\nfreebooting expeditions, and so hastened to reach his goal, which was\r\nthe island of Rhodes. His chief concern was to support as powerful an\r\narmy as possible in those parts, and with this object he proceeded\r\nto levy money aids, visiting various cities, until he finally reached\r\nAspendus, and came to moorings in the river Eurymedon. The money was\r\nsafely collected from the Aspendians, and the work completed, when,\r\ntaking occasion of some depredations (30) of the soldiers on the\r\nfarmsteads, the people of the place in a fit of irritation burst into\r\nthe general's quarters at night and butchered him in his tent.\r\n\r\n (29) According to some critics, B.C. 389 is only now reached.\r\n\r\n (30) See Diod. xiv. 94.\r\n\r\nSo perished Thrasybulus, (31) a good and great man by all admission. In\r\nroom of him the Athenians chose Agyrrhius, (32) who was despatched to\r\ntake command of the fleet. And now the Lacedaemonians--alive to the fact\r\nthat the sale of the Euxine tithe-dues had been negotiated in Byzantium\r\nby Athens; aware also that as long as the Athenians kept hold on\r\nCalchedon the loyalty of the other Hellespontine cities was secured to\r\nthem (at any rate while Pharnabazus remained their friend)--felt that\r\nthe state of affairs demanded their serious attention. They attached no\r\nblame indeed to Dercylidas. Anaxibius, however, through the friendship\r\nof the ephors, contrived to get himself appointed as governor, on a\r\nmission to Abydos. With the requisite funds and ships, he promised to\r\nexert such hostile pressure upon Athens that at least her prospects\r\nin the Hellespont would cease to be so sunny. His friends the ephors\r\ngranted him in return for these promises three ships of war and funds\r\nto support a thousand mercenaries, and so they despatched him on his\r\nmission. Reaching Abydos, he set about improving his naval and military\r\nposition. First he collected a foreign brigade, by help of which he drew\r\noff some of the Aeolid cities from Pharnabazus. Next he set on foot\r\na series of retaliatory expeditions against the states which attacked\r\nAbydos, marching upon them and ravaging their territories; and lastly,\r\nmanning three vessels besides those which he already held in the harbour\r\nof Abydos, he intercepted and brought into port all the merchant ships\r\nof Athens or of her allies which he could lay hands on.\r\n\r\n (31) \"Thus perished the citizen to whom, more than any one else,\r\n    Athens owed not only her renovated democracy, but its wise,\r\n    generous, and harmonious working, after renovation.\"--Grote, \"H.\r\n    G.\" ix. 509.\r\n\r\n (32) For this statesman, see Demosth. \"c.

G.\" Eng tr. iv. 280.\r\n\r\nGetting wind of these proceedings, the Athenians, fearing lest the fair\r\nfoundation laid for them by Thrasybulus in the Hellespont should be\r\nruined, sent out Iphicrates with eight vessels and twelve hundred\r\npeltasts. The majority of them (33) consisted of troops which he had\r\ncommanded at Corinth. In explanation it may be stated that the Argives,\r\nwhen once they had appropriated Corinth and incorporated it with Argos,\r\ngave out they had no further need of Iphicrates and his troops; the real\r\nfact being that he had put to death some of the partisans of Argos. (34)\r\nAnd so it was he turned his back on Corinth and found himself at home in\r\nAthens at the present crisis.\r\n\r\n (33) Or, \"The mass of them.\"\r\n\r\n (34) See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. p. 491 note. The \"Argolising\" or philo-\r\n    Argeian party, as opposed to the philo-Laconian party. See above,\r\n    \"Hell.\" IV. iv. 6.\r\n\r\nB.C. 389-388. When Iphicrates first reached the Chersonese he and\r\nAnaxibius carried on war against each other by the despatch of guerilla\r\nor piratic bands across the straits. But as time wore on, information\r\nreached him of the departure of Anaxibius to Antandrus, accompanied\r\nby his mercenaries and his own bodyguard of Laconians and two hundred\r\nAbydenian hoplites. Hearing further that Anaxibius had won the friendly\r\nadhesion of Antandrus, Iphicrates conjectured that after establishing a\r\ngarrison in that place he would make the best of his way back, if only\r\nto bring the Abydenians home again. He therefore crossed in the night,\r\nselecting a desert point on the Abydene coast, from which he scaled\r\nthe hills above the town and planted himself in ambuscade within their\r\nfolds. The triremes which brought him across had orders at break of day\r\nto coast up northwards along the Chersonese, which would suggest the\r\nnotion that he was only out on one of his customary voyages to collect\r\nmoney. The sequel more than fulfilled his expectations. Anaxibius began\r\nhis return march, and if report speaks truly, he did so notwithstanding\r\nthat the victims were against his marching that day; contemptuously\r\ndisregarding the warning, and satisfied that his march lay all along\r\nthrough a friendly country and was directed to a friendly city. Besides\r\nwhich, those whom he met assured him that Iphicrates was off on a voyage\r\nto Proconnesus: hence the unusual absence of precaution on the march.\r\nOn his side Iphicrates saw the chance, but, so long as the troops of\r\nAnaxibius lingered on the level bottoms, refused to spring from his\r\nlair, waiting for the moment when the Abydenian division in the van\r\nwas safely landed in the plain of Cremaste, at the point where the\r\ngold mines stand; the main column following on the downward slope, and\r\nAnaxibius with his Laconians just beginning the descent. At that instant\r\nIphicrates set his ambuscade in motion, and dashed against the Spartan\r\nat full speed. The latter quickly discerned that there was no hope of\r\nescape as he scanned the long straggling line of his attenuated column.\r\nThe troops in advance, he was persuaded, would never be able to come\r\nback to his aid up the face of that acclivity; besides which, he\r\nobserved the utter bewilderment of the whole body at sight of the\r\nambuscade. He therefore turned to those next him, and spoke as follows:\r\n\"Sirs, it is good for me to die on this spot, where honour bids me; but\r\nfor you, sirs, yonder your path lies, haste and save yourselves (35)\r\nbefore the enemy can close with us.\" As the words died on his lips he\r\ntook from the hands of his attendant shield-bearer his heavy shield, and\r\nthere, at his post, unflinchingly fought and fell; not quite alone,\r\nfor by his side faithfully lingered a favourite youth, and of the\r\nLacedaemonian governors who had rallied to Abydos from their several\r\ncities yet other twelve fought and fell beside the pair. The rest fled,\r\ndropping down one by one as the army pursued them to the walls of the\r\ncity. The death-roll amounted to something like fifty hoplites of the\r\nAbydenians, and of the rest two hundred. After this exploit Iphicrates\r\nreturned to the Chersonese. (36)\r\n\r\n (35) Or, \"sauve qui peut.\"\r\n\r\n (36) See Hicks, 76; and below, \"Hell.\" V. i. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nB.C. 388. Such was the state of affairs in the Hellespont, so far at\r\nleast as Athens and Sparta are concerned. Eteonicus was once more in\r\nAegina; and notwithstanding that the Aeginetans and Athenians had up to\r\nthis time held commercial intercourse, yet now that the war was plainly\r\nto be fought out on the sea, that officer, with the concurrence of the\r\nephorate, gave permission to any one who liked to plunder Attica. (1)\r\nThe Athenians retaliated by despatching a body of hoplites under their\r\ngeneral Pamphilus, who constructed a fort against the Aeginetans,\r\n(2) and proceeded to blockade them by land and sea with ten warships.\r\nTeleutias, however, while threading his way among the islands in\r\nquestion of contributions, had chanced to reach a point where he\r\nreceived information of the turn in affairs with regard to the\r\nconstruction of the fortress, whereupon he came to the rescue of the\r\nbeleaguered Aeginetans, and so far succeeded that he drove off the\r\nenemy's blockading squadron. But Pamphilus kept a firm hold on the\r\noffensive fortress, and was not to be dislodged.\r\n\r\n (1) Or, \"determined to let slip the hounds of war;\" or, more\r\n    prosaically, \"issued letters of marque.\" See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix.\r\n    517.\r\n\r\n (2) I.e. in Aegina as an {epiteikhisma}.\r\n\r\nAfter this the new admiral Hierax arrived from Lacedaemon. The naval\r\nforce was transferred into his successor's hands, and under the happiest\r\nauspices Teleutias set sail for home. As he descended to the seashore\r\nto start on his homeward voyage there was not one among his soldiers\r\nwho had not a warm shake of the hand for their old admiral. Here one\r\npresented him with a crown, and there another with a victor's wreath;\r\nand those who arrived too late, still, as the ship weighed anchor, threw\r\ngarlands into the sea and wafted him many a blessing with prayerful\r\nlips. I am well aware that in the above incident I have no memorable\r\nstory of munificence, peril, or invention to narrate, but in all\r\nsincerity I protest that a man may find food for reflection in the\r\ninquiry what Teleutias had done to create such a disposition in his\r\nsubordinates. Here we are brought face to face with a true man's work\r\nmore worthy of account than multitudes of riches or adventure. (3)\r\n\r\n (3) See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 518: \"The ideal of government as it\r\n    presented itself to Xenophon was the paternal despotism or\r\n    something like it,\" {to ethelonton arkhein}. Cf. \"Cyrop.\" passim,\r\n    \"Heiro,\" and his various other compositions.\r\n\r\nThe new admiral Hierax, taking with him the larger portion of the fleet,\r\nset sail once more for Rhodes. He left behind him twelve vessels\r\nin Aegina under his vice-admiral Gorgopas, who was now installed as\r\ngovernor of that island. In consequence of this chance the Athenian\r\ntroops inside the fortres were more blockaded than the Aeginetans\r\nthemselves, so much so that a vote was passed by the Athenian assembly,\r\nin obedience to which a large fleet was manned, and the garrison, after\r\nfour months' sojourn in Aegina, were brought back. But this was\r\nno sooner done than they began to be harassed by Gorgopas and the\r\nprivateers again. To operate against these they fitted out thirteen\r\nvessels, choosing Eunomus as admiral in command. Hierax was still in\r\nRhodes when the Lacedaemonians sent out a new admiral, Antalcidas; they\r\nbelieved that they could not find a better mode of gratifying Tiribazus.\r\nAccordingly Antalcidas, after visiting Aegina in order to pick up the\r\nvessels under Gorgopas, set sail for Ephesus. At this point he sent back\r\nGorgopas with his twelve ships to Aegina, and appointed his vice-admiral\r\nNicolochus to command the remainder of the fleet.\r\n\r\nNicolochus was to relieve Abydos, and thither set sail; but in the\r\ncourse of the voyage turned aside to Tenedos, where he ravaged the\r\nterritory, and, with the money so secured, sailed on to Abydos. The\r\nAthenian generals (4) on their side, collecting from Samothrace, Thasos,\r\nand the fortresses in that quarter, hastened to the relief of Tenedos;\r\nbut, finding that Nicolochus had continued his voyage to Abydos, they\r\nselected the Chersonese as their base, and proceeded to blockade him\r\nand his fleet of five-and-twenty vessels with the two-and-thirty vessels\r\nunder their joint command.\r\n\r\n (4) And among the rest Iphicrates and Diotimus. See below, S. 25;\r\n    above, IV. viii. 39.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Gorgopas, returning from Ephesus, fell in with the Athenian\r\nadmiral Eunomus, and, shunning an encounter at the moment, sought\r\nshelter in Aegina, which he reached a little before sunset; and at\r\nonce disembarking his men, set them down to their evening meal; whilst\r\nEunomus on his side, after hanging back for a little while, sailed away.\r\nNight fell, and the Athenian, showing the customary signal light to\r\nprevent his squadron straggling, led the way in the darkness. Gorgopas\r\ninstantly got his men on board again, and, taking the lantern for his\r\nguide, followed the Athenians, craftily lagging behind a little space,\r\nso as not to show himself or raise any suspicion of his presence. In\r\nplace of the usual cry the boatswains timed the rowers by a clink of\r\nstones, and silently the oars slid, feathering through the waves (5);\r\nand just when the squadron of Eunomus was touching the coast, off Cape\r\nZoster (6) in Attica, the Spartan sounded the bugle-note for the charge.\r\nSome of Eunomus's vessels were in the act of discharging their crews,\r\nothers were still getting to their moorings, whilst others were as yet\r\nonly bearing down to land. The engagement was fought by the light of the\r\nmoon, and Gorgopas captured four triremes, which he tied astern, and so\r\nset sail with his prizes in tow towards Aegina. The rest of the Athenian\r\nsquadron made their escape into the harbour of Piraeus.\r\n\r\n (5) Lit. \"the boatswains employing a clink of stones and a sliding\r\n    motion of the oars.\"\r\n\r\n (6) I.e. \"Cape Girdle,\" mod. Cape Karvura. See Tozer, \"Geog. of\r\n    Greece,\" pp. 78, 372.\r\n\r\nIt was after these events that Chabrias (7) commenced his voyage to\r\nCyprus, bringing relief to Evagoras. His force consisted at first of\r\neight hundred light troops and ten triremes, but was further increased\r\nby other vessels from Athens and a body of heavy infantry. Thus\r\nreinforced, the admiral chose a night and landed in Aegina; and secreted\r\nhimself in ambuscade with his light troops in hollow ground some way\r\nbeyond the temple of Heracles. At break of day, as prearranged, the\r\nAthenian hoplites made their appearance under command of Demaenetus, and\r\nbegan mounting up between two and three miles (8) beyond the Kerakleion\r\nat Tripurgia, as it is called. The news soon reached Gorgopas, who\r\nsallied out to the rescue with the Aeginetans and the marines of his\r\nvessels, being further accompanied by eight Spartans who happened to be\r\nwith him. Not content with these he issued orders inviting any of the\r\nships' crews, who were free men, to join the relief party. A large\r\nnumber of these sailors responded. They armed themselves as best they\r\ncould, and the advance commenced. When the vanguard were well past the\r\nambuscade, Chabrias and his men sprang up from their hiding-place,\r\nand poured a volley of javelins and stones upon the enemy. At the same\r\nmoment the hoplites, who had disembarked, (9) were advancing, so that\r\nthe Spartan vanguard, in the absence of anything like collective\r\naction, were speedily cut down, and among them fell Gorgopas with the\r\nLacedaemonians. At their fall the rest of course turned and fled. One\r\nhundred and fifty Aeginetans were numbered among the slain, while the\r\nloss incurred by the foreigners, metics, and sailors who had joined the\r\nrelief party, reached a total of two hundred. After this the Athenians\r\nsailed the sea as freely as in the times of actual peace. Nor would\r\nanything induce the sailors to row a single stroke for Eteonicus--even\r\nunder pressure--since he had no pay to give.\r\n\r\n (7) According to Diod. xiv. 92, Chabrias had been for some time in\r\n    Corinth. See also above, IV. viii. 24.\r\n\r\n (8) Lit. \"about sixteen stades.\"\r\n\r\n (9) Or, reading {oi anabebekotes}, \"who had scaled the height.\" See\r\n    Hartman, \"Anal. Xen.\" p. 364.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the Lacedaemonians despatched Teleutias once again to take\r\ncommand of the squadron, and when the sailors saw it was he who had\r\ncome, they were overjoyed. He summoned a meeting and addressed them\r\nthus: \"Soldiers, I am back again, but I bring with me no money. Yet if\r\nGod be willing, and your zeal flag not, I will endeavour to supply\r\nyou with provisions without stint. Be well assured, as often as I find\r\nmyself in command of you, I have but one prayer--that your lives may\r\nbe spared no less than mine; and as for the necessaries of existence,\r\nperhaps it would astonish you if I said I would rather you should\r\nhave them than I. Yet by the gods I swear I would welcome two days'\r\nstarvation in order to spare you one. Was not my door open in old days\r\nto every comer? Open again it shall stand now; and so it shall be; where\r\nyour own board overflows, you shall look in and mark the luxury of your\r\ngeneral; but if at other times you see him bearing up against cold and\r\nheat and sleepless nights, you must apply the lesson to yourselves\r\nand study to endure those evils. I do not bid you do aught of this for\r\nself-mortification's sake, but that you may derive some after-blessing\r\nfrom it. Soldiers, let Lacedaemon, our own mother-city, be to you an\r\nexample. Her good fortune is reputed to stand high. That you know; and\r\nyou know too, that she purchased her glory and her greatness not by\r\nfaint-heartedness, but by choosing to suffer pain and incur dangers in\r\nthe day of need. 'Like city,' I say, 'like citizens.' You, too, as I\r\ncan bear you witness, have been in times past brave; but to-day must we\r\nstrive to be better than ourselves. So shall we share our pains without\r\nrepining, and when fortune smiles, mingle our joys; for indeed the\r\nsweetest thing of all surely is to flatter no man, Hellene or Barbarian,\r\nfor the sake of hire; we will suffice to ourselves, and from a source\r\nto which honour pre-eminently invites us; since, I need not remind you,\r\nabundance won from the enemy in war furnishes forth not bodily nutrition\r\nonly, but a feast of glory the wide world over.\"\r\n\r\nSo he spoke, and with one voice they all shouted to him to issue what\r\norders he thought fit; they would not fail him in willing service. The\r\ngeneral's sacrifice was just concluded, and he answered: \"Good, then, my\r\nmen; go now, as doubtless you were minded, and take your evening meal,\r\nand next provide yourselves, please, with one day's food. After that\r\nrepair to your ships without delay, for we have a voyage on hand,\r\nwhither God wills, and must arrive in time.\" So then, when the men\r\nreturned, he embarked them on their ships, and sailed under cover of\r\nnight for the great harbour of Piraeus: at one time he gave the rowers\r\nrest, passing the order to take a snatch of sleep; at another he pushed\r\nforward towards his goal with rise and fall of oars. If any one supposes\r\nthat there was a touch of madness in such an expedition--with but\r\ntwelve triremes to attack an enemy possessed of a large fleet--he should\r\nconsider the calculations of Teleutias. He was under the firm persuasion\r\nthat the Athenians were more careless than ever about their navy in the\r\nharbour since the death of Gorgopas; and in case of finding warships\r\nriding at anchor--even so, there was less danger, he conjectured, in\r\nattacking twenty ships in the port of Athens than ten elsewhere; for,\r\nwhereas, anywhere outside the harbour the sailors would certainly be\r\nquartered on board, at Athens it was easy to divine that the captains\r\nand officers would be sleeping at their homes, and the crews located\r\nhere and there in different quarters.\r\n\r\nThis minded he set sail, and when he was five or six furlongs (10)\r\ndistant from the harbour he lay on his oars and rested. But with the\r\nfirst streak of dawn he led the way, the rest following. The admiral's\r\norders to the crews were explicit. They were on no account to sink any\r\nmerchant vessel; they were equally to avoid damaging (11) their own\r\nvessels, but if at any point they espied a warship at her moorings they\r\nmust try and cripple her. The trading vessels, provided they had got\r\ntheir cargoes on board, they must seize and tow out of the harbour;\r\nthose of larger tonnage they were to board wherever they could and\r\ncapture the crews. Some of his men actually jumped on to the Deigma\r\nquay, (12) where they seized hold of various traders and pilots and\r\ndeposited them bodily on board ship. So the Spartan admiral carried out\r\nhis programme.\r\n\r\n (10) Lit. \"five or six stades.\"\r\n\r\n (11) See Hartman, \"Anal. Xen.\" pp. 365, 366.\r\n\r\n (12) See Grote (\"H. G.\" ix. 523): cf. Thuc. ii. 94, the attempt of\r\n    Brasidas on the port of Megara. For the wealth of Piraeus, Grote\r\n    \"H. G.\" ix. 351. See below, \"Pol. Ath.\" i. 17; \"Rev.\" iii. 13.\r\n\r\nAs to the Athenians, meanwhile, some of them who got wind of what was\r\nhappening rushed from indoors outside to see what the commotion meant,\r\nothers from the streets home to get their arms, and others again were\r\noff to the city with the news. The whole of Athens rallied to the rescue\r\nat that instant, heavy infantry and cavalry alike, the apprehension\r\nbeing that Piraeus was taken. But the Spartan sent off the captured\r\nvessels to Aegina, telling off three or four of his triremes to convoy\r\nthem thither; with the rest he followed along the coast of Attica, and\r\nemerging in seemingly innocent fashion from the harbour, captured\r\na number of fishing smacks, and passage boats laden with passengers\r\ncrossing to Piraeus from the islands; and finally, on reaching Sunium\r\nhe captured some merchantmen laden with corn or other merchandise. After\r\nthese performances he sailed back to Aegina, where he sold his prizes,\r\nand with the proceeds was able to provide his troops with a month's\r\npay, and for the future was free to cruise about and make what reprisals\r\nchance cast in his way. By such a procedure he was able to support a\r\nfull quota of mariners on board his squadron, and procured to himself\r\nthe prompt and enthusiastic service of his troops.\r\n\r\nB.C. 388-387. Antalcidas had now returned from the Persian court with\r\nTiribazus. The negotiations had been successful. He had secured the\r\nalliance of the Persian king and his military co-operation in case the\r\nAthenians and their allies refused to abide by the peace which the king\r\ndictated. But learning that his second in command, Nicolochus, was being\r\nblockaded with his fleet by Iphicrates and Diotimus (13) in Abydos, he\r\nset off at once by land for that city. Being come thither he took the\r\nfleet one night and put out to sea, having first spread a story that he\r\nhad invitations from a party in Calchedon; but as a matter of fact\r\nhe came to anchorage in Percote and there kept quiet. Meanwhile the\r\nAthenian forces under Demaenetus and Dionysius and Leontichus and\r\nPhanias had got wind of his movement, and were in hot pursuit towards\r\nProconnesus. As soon as they were well past, the Spartan veered round\r\nand returned to Abydos, trusting to information brought him of the\r\napproach of Polyxenus with the Syracusan (14) and Italian squadron of\r\ntwenty ships, which he wished to pick up and incorporate with his own.\r\n\r\n (13) See above; Lysias, \"de bon. Arist.\" (Jebb, \"Att. Or.\" i. p. 327).\r\n\r\n (14) See below, VI. ii. 4 foll; Hicks, 71, 84, 88.\r\n\r\nA little later the Athenian Thrasybulus (15) (of Collytus) was making\r\nhis way up with eight ships from Thrace, his object being to effect\r\na junction with the main Athenian squadron. The scouts signalled the\r\napproach of eight triremes, whereupon Antalcidas, embarking his marines\r\non board twelve of the fastest sailers of his fleet, ordered them to\r\nmake up their full complements, where defective, from the remaining\r\nvessels; and so lay to, skulking in his lair with all possible secrecy.\r\nAs soon as the enemy's vessels came sailing past he gave chase; and\r\nthey catching sight of him took to flight. With his swiftest sailors\r\nhe speedily overhauled their laggards, and ordering his vanguard to let\r\nthese alone, he followed hard on those ahead. But when the foremost\r\nhad fallen into his clutches, the enemy's hinder vessels, seeing their\r\nleaders taken one by one, out of sheer despondency fell an easy prey\r\nto the slower sailers of the foe, so that not one of the eight vessels\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n (15) His name occurs on the famous stele of the new Athenian\r\n    confederacy, B.C. 378. See Hicks, 81; Kohler, \"C. I. A.\" ii. 17;\r\n    Demos. \"de. Cor.\" p. 301; Arist. \"Rhet.\" ii. 23; Demos. \"c.\r\n    Timocr.\" 742.\r\n\r\nPresently the Syracusan squadron of twenty vessels joined him, and again\r\nanother squadron from Ionia, or rather so much of that district as lay\r\nunder the control of Tiribazus. The full quota of the contingent\r\nwas further made up from the territory of Ariobarzanes (which whom\r\nAntalcidas kept up a friendship of long standing), in the absence of\r\nPharnabazus, who by this date had already been summoned up country on\r\nthe occasion of his marriage with the king's daughter. With this fleet,\r\nwhich, from whatever sources derived, amounted to more than eighty sail,\r\nAntalcidas ruled the seas, and was in a position not only to cut off the\r\npassage of vessels bound to Athens from the Euxine, but to convoy them\r\ninto the harbours of Sparta's allies.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians could not but watch with alarm the growth of the enemy's\r\nfleet, and began to fear a repetition of their former discomfiture.\r\nTo be trampled under foot by the hostile power seemed indeed no remote\r\npossibility, now that the Lacedaemonians had procured an ally in the\r\nperson of the Persian monarch, and they were in little less than a state\r\nof siege themselves, pestered as they were by privateers from Aegina. On\r\nall these grounds the Athenians became passionately desirous of peace.\r\n(16) The Lacedaemonians were equally out of humour with the war for\r\nvarious reasons--what with their garrison duties, one mora at Lechaeum\r\nand another at Orchomenus, and the necessity of keeping watch and ward\r\non the states, if loyal not to lose them, if disaffected to prevent\r\ntheir revolt; not to mention that reciprocity of annoyance (17) of which\r\nCorinth was the centre. So again the Argives had a strong appetite for\r\npeace; they knew that the ban had been called out against them, and,\r\nit was plain, that no fictitious alteration of the calendar would any\r\nlonger stand them in good stead. Hence, when Tiribazus issued a summons\r\ncalling on all who were willing to listen to the terms of peace sent\r\ndown by the king (18) to present themselves, the invitation was promptly\r\naccepted. At the opening of the conclave (19) Tiribazus pointed to\r\nthe king's seal attached to the document, and proceeded to read the\r\ncontents, which ran as follows:\r\n\r\n (16) See, at this point, Grote on the financial condition of Athens\r\n    and the \"Theorikon,\" \"H. G.\" ix. 525.\r\n\r\n (17) Or, \"that give-and-take of hard knocks.\"\r\n\r\n (18) See Hicks, 76.\r\n\r\n (19) At Sardis, doubtless.\r\n\r\n\"The king, Artaxerxes, deems it just that the cities in Asia, with the\r\nislands of Clazomenae and Cyprus, should belong to himself; the rest of\r\nthe Hellenic cities he thinks it just to leave independent, both small\r\nand great, with the exception of Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, which three\r\nare to belong to Athens as of yore. Should any of the parties concerned\r\nnot accept this peace, I, Artaxerxes, will war against him or them with\r\nthose who share my views. This will I do by land and by sea, with ships\r\nand with money.\"\r\n\r\nAfter listening to the above declaration the ambassadors from the\r\nseveral states proceeded to report the same to their respective\r\ngovernments. One and all of these took the oaths (20) to ratify and\r\nconfirm the terms unreservedly, with the exception of the Thebans,\r\nwho claimed to take the oaths in behalf of all Boeotians. This claim\r\nAgesilaus repudiated: unless they chose to take the oaths in precise\r\nconformity with the words of the king's edict, which insisted on \"the\r\nfuture autonomy of each state, small or great,\" he would not admit them.\r\nTo this the Theban ambassadors made no other reply, except that\r\nthe instructions they had received were different. \"Pray go, then,\"\r\nAgesilaus retorted, \"and ask the question; and you may inform your\r\ncountrymen that if they will not comply, they will be excluded from the\r\ntreaty.\" The Theban ambassadors departed, but Agesilaus, out of hatred\r\nto the Thebans, took active measures at once. Having got the consent of\r\nthe ephors he forthwith offered sacrifice. The offerings for crossing\r\nthe frontier were propitious, and he pushed on to Tegea. From Tegea he\r\ndespatched some of the knights right and left to visit the perioeci\r\nand hasten their mobilisation, and at the same time sent commanders of\r\nforeign brigades to the allied cities on a similar errand. But before\r\nhe had started from Tegea the answer from Thebes arrived; the point was\r\nyielded, they would suffer the states to be independent. Under these\r\ncircumstances the Lacedaemonians returned home, and the Thebans were\r\nforced to accept the truce unconditionally, and to recognise the\r\nautonomy of the Boeotian cities. (21) But now the Corinthians were by\r\nno means disposed to part with the garrison of the Argives. Accordingly\r\nAgesilaus had a word of warning for both. To the former he said, \"if\r\nthey did not forthwith dismiss the Argives,\" and to the latter, \"if\r\nthey did not instantly quit Corinth,\" he would march an army into their\r\nterritories. The terror of both was so great that the Argives marched\r\nout of Corinth, and Corinth was once again left to herself; (22)\r\nwhereupon the \"butchers\" (23) and their accomplices in the deed of blood\r\ndetermined to retire from Corinth, and the rest of the citizens welcomed\r\nback their late exiles voluntarily.\r\n\r\n (20) At Sparta, doubtless.\r\n\r\n (21) See Freeman, op. cit. pp. 168, 169.\r\n\r\n (22) See \"Ages.\" ii. 21; Grote, \"H.

From a condition which, during\r\nthe war, can only be described as a sort of even balance with their\r\nantagonists, the Lacedaemonians now emerged; and reached a pinnacle\r\nof glory consequent upon the Peace of Antalcidas, (24) so called.\r\nAs guarantors of the peace presented by Hellas to the king, and as\r\nadministrators personally of the autonomy of the states, they had added\r\nCorinth to their alliance; they had obtained the independence of\r\nthe states of Boeotia at the expense of Thebes, (25) which meant the\r\ngratification of an old ambition; and lastly, by calling out the ban in\r\ncase the Argives refused to evacuate Corinth, they had put a stop to the\r\nappropriation of that city by the Argives.\r\n\r\n (24) Or, more correctly, the peace \"under,\" or \"at the date of,\" {ep\r\n    'Antalkidou}. See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 1, note 1.\r\n\r\n (25) Or, \"they had made the states of Boeotia independent of Thebes.\"\r\n    See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nB.C. 386. Indeed the late events had so entirely shaped themselves in\r\nconformity with the wishes of the Lacedaemonians, that they determined\r\nto go a step farther and chastise those of their allies who either had\r\nborne hard on them during the war, or otherwise had shown themselves\r\nless favourable to Lacedaemon than to her enemies. (1) Chastisement was\r\nnot all; they must lay down such secure foundations for the future as\r\nshould render the like disloyalty impossible again. (2) As the first\r\nstep towards this policy they sent a dictatorial message to the\r\nMantinaeans, and bade them raze their fortifications, on the sole ground\r\nthat they could not otherwise trust them not to side with their enemies.\r\nMany things in their conduct, they alleged, from time to time, had not\r\nescaped their notice: their frequent despatches of corn to the Argives\r\nwhile at war with Lacedaemon; at other times their refusal to furnish\r\ncontingents during a campaign, on the pretext of some holy truce or\r\nother; (3) or if they did reluctantly take the field--the miserable\r\ninefficiency of their service. \"But, more than that,\" they added, \"we\r\nnote the jealousy with which you eye any good fortune which may betide\r\nour state; the extravagant pleasure (4) you exhibit at the sudden\r\ndescent of some disaster.\"\r\n\r\n (1) See Hartman, \"An. Xen.\" p. 367 foll.; Busolt, \"Die Lak.\" p. 129\r\n    foll.\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"they determined to chastise... and reduce to such order\r\n    that disloyalty should be impossible.\"\r\n\r\n (3) See above, \"Hell.\" IV. ii. 16.\r\n\r\n (4) Ib. IV. v. 18.\r\n\r\nThis very year, moreover, it was commonly said, (5) saw the expiration,\r\nas far as the Mantineans were concerned, of the thirty years' truce,\r\nconsequent upon the battle of Mantinea. On their refusal, therefore,\r\nto raze their fortification walls the ban was called out against them.\r\nAgesilaus begged the state to absolve him from the conduct of this war\r\non the plea that the city of Mantinea had done frequent service to\r\nhis father (6) in his Messenian wars. Accordingly Agesipolis led the\r\nexpedition--in spite of the cordial relations of his father Pausanias\r\n(7) with the leaders of the popular party in Mantinea.\r\n\r\n (5) As to this point, see Curtius, \"H. G.\" V. v. (iv. 305 note, Eng.\r\n    trans.) There appears to be some confusion. According to Thuc. v.\r\n    81, \"When the Argives deserted the alliance  (with Mantinea,\r\n    Athens, and Elis, making a new treaty of alliance with Lacedaemon\r\n    for fifty years) the Mantineans held out for a time, but without\r\n    the Argives they were helpless, and so they came to terms with the\r\n    Lacedaemonians, and gave up their claims to supremacy over the\r\n    cities in Arcadia, which had been subject to them.... These\r\n    changes were effected at the close of winter  (418 B.C.) towards\r\n    the approach of spring  (417 B.C.), and so ended the fourteenth\r\n    year of the war.\" Jowett. According to Diod. xv. 5, the\r\n    Lacedaemonians attacked Mantinea within two years after the Peace\r\n    of Antalcidas, apparently in 386 B.C. According to Thuc. v. 82,\r\n    and \"C. I. A. 50, in B.C. 417 Argos had reverted to her alliance\r\n    with Athens, and an attempt to connect the city with the sea by\r\n    long walls was made, certain other states in Peloponnese being\r\n    privy to the project\" (Thuc. v. 83)--an attempt frustrated by\r\n    Lacedaemon early in B.C. 416. Is it possible that a treaty of\r\n    alliance between Mantinea and Lacedaemon for thirty years was\r\n    formally signed in B.C. 416?\r\n\r\n (6) I.e. Archidamus.\r\n\r\n (7) See above, \"Hell.\" III. v. 25.\r\n\r\nB.C. 385. The first move of the invader was to subject the enemy's\r\nterritory to devastation; but failing by such means to induce them to\r\nraze their walls, he proceeded to draw lines of circumvallation round\r\nthe city, keeping half his troops under arms to screen the entrenching\r\nparties whilst the other half pushed on the work with the spade. As soon\r\nas the trench was completed, he experienced no further difficulty in\r\nbuilding a wall round the city. Aware, however, of the existence of a\r\nhuge supply of corn inside the town, the result of the bountiful harvest\r\nof the preceding year, and averse to the notion of wearing out the city\r\nof Lacedaemon and her allies by tedious campaigning, he hit upon the\r\nexpedient of damming up the river which flowed through the town.\r\n\r\nIt was a stream of no inconsiderable size. (8) By erecting a barrier at\r\nits exit from the town he caused the water to rise above the basements\r\nof the private dwellings and the foundations of the fortification walls.\r\nThen, as the lower layers of bricks became saturated and refused their\r\nsupport to the rows above, the wall began to crack and soon to totter\r\nto its fall. The citizens for some time tried to prop it with pieces\r\nof timber, and used other devices to avert the imminent ruin of their\r\ntower; but finding themselves overmatched by the water, and in dread\r\nlest the fall at some point or other of the circular wall (9) might\r\ndeliver them captive to the spear of the enemy, they signified their\r\nconsent to raze their walls. But the Lacedaemonians now steadily refused\r\nany form of truce, except on the further condition that the Mantineans\r\nwould suffer themselves to be broken up and distributed into villages.\r\nThey, looking the necessity in the face, consented to do even that. The\r\nsympathisers with Argos among them, and the leaders of their democracy,\r\nthought their fate was sealed. Then the father treated with the son,\r\nPausanias with Agesipolis, on their behalf, and obtained immunity for\r\nthem--sixty in number--on condition that they should quit the city. The\r\nLacedaemonian troops stood lining the road on both sides, beginning\r\nfrom the gates, and watched the outgoers; and with their spears in\r\ntheir hands, in spite of bitter hatred, kept aloof from them with less\r\ndifficulty than the Mantineans of the better classes themselves--a\r\nweighty testimony to the power of Spartan discipline, be it said. In\r\nconclusion, the wall was razed, and Mantinea split up into four parts,\r\n(10) assuming once again its primitive condition as regards inhabitants.\r\nThe first feeling was one of annoyance at the necessity of pulling down\r\ntheir present houses and erecting others, yet when the owners (11)\r\nfound themselves located so much nearer their estates round about the\r\nvillages, in the full enjoyment of aristocracy, and rid for ever of\r\n\"those troublesome demagogues,\" they were delighted with the turn which\r\naffairs had taken. It became the custom for Sparta to send them, not one\r\ncommander of contingents, (12) but four, one for each village; and the\r\nzeal displayed, now that the quotas for military service were furnished\r\nfrom the several village centres, was far greater than it had been under\r\nthe democratic system. So the transactions in connection with Mantinea\r\nwere brought to a conclusion, and thereby one lesson of wisdom was\r\ntaught mankind--not to conduct a river through a fortress town.\r\n\r\n (8) I.e. the Ophis. See Leake, \"Morea,\" III. xxiv. p. 71; Pausan.\r\n    \"Arcad.\" 8; Grote, \"H.

The party in exile from Phlius, seeing the\r\nsevere scrutiny to which the behaviour of the allies of Lacedaemon\r\nduring the late war was being subjected, felt that their opportunity had\r\ncome. They repaired to Lacedaemon, and laid great emphasis on the fact\r\nthat, so long as they had been in power themselves at home, \"their\r\ncity used to welcome Lacedaemonians within her walls, and her citizens\r\nflocked to the campaign under their leadership; but no sooner had they\r\nbeen driven into exile than a change had come. The men of Phlius now\r\nflatly refused to follow Lacedaemon anywhere; the Lacedaemonians, alone\r\nof all men living, must not be admitted within their gates.\" After\r\nlistening to their story, the ephors agreed that the matter demanded\r\nattention. Then they sent to the state of Phlius a message to this\r\neffect; the Phliasian exiles were friends of Lacedaemon; nor did\r\nit appear that they owed their exile to any misdoing. Under the\r\ncircumstances, Lacedaemon claimed their recall from banishment, not by\r\nforce, but as a concession voluntarily granted. When the matter was thus\r\nstated, the Phliasians were not without alarm that an army might march\r\nupon Phlius, and a party inside the town might admit the enemy within\r\nthe walls; for within the walls of Phlius were to be found many who,\r\neither as blood relations or for other reasons, were partisans of the\r\nexiles, and as so often happens, at any rate in the majority of states,\r\nthere was a revolutionary party who, in their ardour to reform, would\r\nwelcome gladly their restoration. Owing to fears of this character, a\r\nformal decree was passed: to welcome home the exiles, and to restore\r\nto them all undisputed property, the purchasers of the same being\r\nindemnified from the treasury of the state; and in the event of any\r\nambiguity or question arising between the parties, the same to be\r\ndetermined before a court of justice. Such was the position of affairs\r\nin connection with the Phliasian exiles at the date in question.\r\n\r\nB.C. 383. (13) And now from yet another quarter ambassadors arrived at\r\nLacedaemon: that is to say, from Acanthus and Apollonia, the two largest\r\nand most important states of the Olynthian confederacy. The ephorate,\r\nafter learning from them the object of their visit, presented them to\r\nthe assembly and the allies, in presence of whom Cleigenes of Acanthus\r\nmade a speech to this effect:\r\n\r\n (13) Al. B.C. 382.\r\n\r\n\"Men of Lacedaemon and of the allied states,\" he said, \"are you aware of\r\na silent but portentous growth within the bosom of Hellas? (14) Few here\r\nneed to be told that for size and importance Olynthus now stands at\r\nthe head of the Thracian cities. But are you aware that the citizens of\r\nOlynthus had already brought over several states by the bribe of joint\r\ncitizenship and common laws; that they have forcibly annexed some of the\r\nlarger states; and that, so encouraged, they have taken in hand\r\nfurther to free the cities of Macedonia from Amyntas the king of the\r\nMacedonians; that, as soon as their immediate neighbours had shown\r\ncompliance, they at once proceeded to attack larger and more distant\r\ncommunities; so much so, that when we started to come hither, we left\r\nthem masters not only of many other places, but of Pella itself, the\r\ncapital of Macedonia. Amyntas, (15) we saw plainly, must ere long\r\nwithdraw from his cities, and was in fact already all but in name an\r\noutcast from Macedonia.\r\n\r\n (14) Or, \"are you aware of a new power growing up in Hellas?\"\r\n\r\n (15) For Amyntas's reign, see Diod. xiv. 89, 92; xv. 19; Isocr.\r\n    \"Panegyr.\" 126, \"Archid.\" 46.\r\n\r\n\"The Olynthians have actually sent to ourselves and to the men of\r\nApollonia a joint embassy, warning us of their intention to attack us if\r\nwe refuse to present ourselves at Olynthus with a military contingent.\r\nNow, for our parts, men of Lacedaemon, we desire nothing better than to\r\nabide by our ancestral laws and institutions, to be free and independent\r\ncitizens; but if aid from without is going to fail us, we too must\r\nfollow the rest and coalesce with the Olynthians. Why, even now they\r\nmuster no less than eight hundred (16) heavy infantry and a considerably\r\nlarger body of light infantry, while their cavalry, when we have joined\r\nthem, will exceed one thousand men. At the date of our departure we left\r\nembassies from Athens and Boeotia in Olynthus, and we were told that\r\nthe Olynthians themselves had passed a formal resolution to return the\r\ncompliment. They were to send an embassy on their side to the aforesaid\r\nstates to treat of an alliance. And yet, if the power of the Athenians\r\nand the Thebans is to be further increased by such an accession of\r\nstrength, look to it,\" the speaker added, \"whether hereafter you will\r\nfind things so easy to manage in that quarter.\r\n\r\n (16) See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 72; Thirlwall, \"H. G.\" v. 12 (ch. xxxvii).\r\n\r\n\"They hold Potidaea, the key to the isthmus of Pallene, and therefore,\r\nyou can well believe, they can command the states within that peninsula.\r\nIf you want any further proof of the abject terror of those states, you\r\nhave it in the fact that notwithstanding the bitter hatred which they\r\nbear to Olynthus, not one of them has dared to send ambassadors along\r\nwith us to apprise you of these matters.\r\n\r\n\"Reflect, how you can reconcile your anxiety to prevent the unification\r\nof Boeotia with your neglect to hinder the solidifying of a far larger\r\npower--a power destined, moreover, to become formidable not on land\r\nonly, but by sea? For what is to stop it, when the soil itself supplies\r\ntimber for shipbuilding, (17) and there are rich revenues derived\r\nfrom numerous harbours and commercial centres?--it cannot but be that\r\nabundance of food and abundance of population will go hand in hand. Nor\r\nhave we yet reached the limits of Olynthian expansion; there are their\r\nneighbours to be thought of--the kingless or independent Thracians.\r\nThese are already to-day the devoted servants of Olynthus, and when it\r\ncomes to their being actually under her, that means at once another vast\r\naccession of strength to her. With the Thracians in her train, the gold\r\nmines of Pangaeus would stretch out to her the hand of welcome.\r\n\r\n (17) See Hicks, 74, for a treaty between Amyntas and the Chalcidians,\r\n    B.C. 390-389: \"The article of the treaty between Amyntas III.,\r\n    father of Philip, and the Chalcidians, about timber, etc., reminds\r\n    us that South Macedonia, the Chalcidic peninsula, and Amphipolis\r\n    were the chief sources whence Athens derived timber for her\r\n    dockyards.\" Thuc. iv. 108; Diod. xx. 46; Boeckh, \"P. E. A.\" p.\r\n    250; and for a treaty between Athens and Amyntas, B.C. 382, see\r\n    Hicks, 77; Kohler, \"C. I. A.\" ii. 397, 423.\r\n\r\n\"In making these assertions, we are but uttering remarks ten thousand\r\ntimes repeated in the democracy of Olynthus. And as to their confident\r\nspirit, who shall attempt to describe it? It is God, for aught I know,\r\nwho, with the growth of a new capacity, gives increase also to the proud\r\nthoughts and vast designs of humanity. For ourselves, men of Lacedaemon\r\nand of the allied states, our task is completed. We have played our\r\nparts in announcing to you how things stand there. To you it is left to\r\ndetermine whether what we have described is worthy of your concern. One\r\nonly thing further you ought to recognise: the power we have spoken\r\nof as great is not as yet invincible, for those states which are\r\ninvoluntary participants in the citizenship of Olynthus will, in\r\nprospect of any rival power appearing in the field, speedily fall away.\r\nOn the contrary, let them be once closely knit and welded together\r\nby the privileges of intermarriage and reciprocal rights of holding\r\nproperty in land--which have already become enactments; let them\r\ndiscover that it is a gain to them to follow in the wake of conquerors\r\n(just as the Arcadians, (18) for instance, find it profitable to march\r\nin your ranks, whereby they save their own property and pillage their\r\nneighbours'); let these things come to pass, and perhaps you may find\r\nthe knot no longer so easy to unloose.\"\r\n\r\n (18) For the point of the comparison, see Freeman, \"Hist. Fed. Gov.\"\r\n    ch. iv. \"Real nature of the Olynthian scheme,\" pp. 190 foll., and\r\n    note 2, p. 197; also Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 67 foll., 278 foll.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this address, the Lacedaemonians requested the\r\nallies to speak, bidding them give their joint advice as to the best\r\ncourse to be pursued in the interests of Peloponnese and the allies.\r\nThereupon many members, and especially those who wished to gratify\r\nthe Lacedaemonians, agreed in counselling active measures; and it was\r\nresolved that the states should severally send contingents to form a\r\ntotal of ten thousand men. Proposals were also made to allow any state,\r\nso wishing, to give money instead of men, at the rate of three Aeginetan\r\nobols (19) a day per man; or where the contingent consisted of cavalry,\r\nthe pay given for one horseman was to be the equivalent to that of\r\nfour hoplites; while, in the event of any defaulting in service, the\r\nLacedaemonians should be allowed to mulct the said state of a stater\r\nper man per diem. These resolutions were passed, and the deputies\r\nfrom Acanthus rose again. They argued that, though excellent, these\r\nresolutions were not of a nature to be rapidly carried into effect.\r\nWould it not be better, they asked, pending the mobilisation of the\r\ntroops, to despatch an officer at once in command of a force from\r\nLacedaemon and the other states, not too large to start immediately. The\r\neffect would be instantaneous, for the states which had not yet given in\r\ntheir adhesion to Olynthus would be brought to a standstill, and those\r\nalready forcibly enrolled would be shaken in their alliance. These\r\nfurther resolutions being also passed, the Lacedaemonians despatched\r\nEudamidas, accompanied by a body of neodamodes, with perioeci and\r\nSciritae, (20) to the number of two thousand odd. Eudamidas lost no time\r\nin setting out, having obtained leave from the ephors for his brother\r\nPhoebidas to follow later with the remainder of the troops assigned\r\nto him. Pushing on himself to the Thracian territory, he set about\r\ndespatching garrisons to various cities at their request. He also\r\nsecured the voluntary adhesion of Potidaea, although already a member\r\nof the Olynthian alliance; and this town now served as his base of\r\noperations for carrying on war on a scale adapted to his somewhat\r\nlimited armament.\r\n\r\n (19) I.e. \"rather more than sixpence a day for a hoplite, and two\r\n    shillings for a horseman.\" \"The Aeginetan stater weighed about 196\r\n    grains, rather more than two of our shillings, and was divided\r\n    into two drachms of 98 grains, each of which contained six obols\r\n    of about 16 grains each.\" See Percy Gardner, \"Types of Greek\r\n    Coins,\" \"Hist. Int.\" p. 8; Jowett, note to Thuc. III. lxx. 4, vol.\r\n    i. pp. 201, 202.\r\n\r\n (20) Or, \"new citizens, provincials, and Sciritae.\"\r\n\r\nPhoebidas, when the remaining portion of his brother's forces was duly\r\nmustered, put himself at their head and commenced his march. On reaching\r\nThebes the troops encamped outside the city, round the gymnasium.\r\nFaction was rife within the city. The two polemarchs in office, Ismenias\r\nand Leontiades, were diametrically opposed, (21) being the respective\r\nheads of antagonistic political clubs. Hence it was that, while\r\nIsmenias, ever inspired by hatred to the Lacedaemonians, would not come\r\nanywhere near the Spartan general, Leontiades, on the other hand,\r\nwas assiduous in courting him; and when a sufficient intimacy was\r\nestablished between them, he made a proposal as follows: \"You have it\r\nin your power,\" he said, addressing Phoebidas, \"this very day to confer\r\nsupreme benefit on your country. Follow me with your hoplites, and I\r\nwill introduce you into the citadel. That done, you may rest assured\r\nThebes will be completely under the thumb of Lacedaemon and of us, your\r\nfriends. At present, as you see, there is a proclamation forbidding any\r\nTheban to take service with you against Olynthus, but we will change all\r\nthat. You have only to act with us as we suggest, and we shall at once\r\nbe able to furnish you with large supplies of infantry and cavalry, so\r\nthat you will join your brother with a magnificent reinforcement, and\r\npending his proposed reduction of Olynthus, you will have accomplished\r\nthe reduction of a far larger state than that--to wit, this city of\r\nThebes.\"\r\n\r\n (21) See Grote, \"H. G.\" vol. x. p. 80: \"We have little or no\r\n    information respecting the government of Thebes,\" etc. The \"locus\r\n    classicus\" seems to be Plut. \"de Genio Socratis.\" See Freeman, op.\r\n    cit. ch. iv. S. 2, \"Of the Boeotian League,\" pp. 154-184; and, in\r\n    reference to the seizure of the Kadmeia, p. 170.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of Phoebidas was kindled as he listened to the tempting\r\nproposal. To do a brilliant deed was far dearer to him than life; (22)\r\non the other hand, he had no reasoning capacity, and would seem to have\r\nbeen deficient altogether in sound sense. The consent of the Spartan\r\nsecured, Leontiades bade him set his troops in motion, as if everything\r\nwere ready for his departure. \"And anon, when the hour is come,\" added\r\nthe Theban, \"I will be with you, and show you the way myself.\"\r\n\r\n (22) Or, \"Renown was his mistress.\" See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 84.\r\n\r\nThe senate was seated in the arcade or stoa in the market-place, since\r\nthe Cadmeia was in possession of the women who were celebrating the\r\nThesmophoria. (23) It was noon of a hot summer's day; scarcely a soul\r\nwas stirring in the streets. This was the moment for Leontiades. He\r\nmounted on horseback and galloped off to overtake Phoebidas. He turned\r\nhim back, and led him without further delay into the acropolis. Having\r\nposted Phoebidas and his soldiers inside, he handed him the key of the\r\ngates, and warning him not to suffer any one to enter into the citadel\r\nwithout a pass from himself, he straightway betook himself to\r\nthe senate. Arrived there, he delivered himself thus: \"Sirs, the\r\nLacedaemonians are in possession of the citadel; but that is no\r\ncause for despondency, since, as they assure us, they have no hostile\r\nintention, except, indeed, towards any one who has an appetite for\r\nwar. For myself, and acting in obedience to the law, which empowers the\r\npolemarch to apprehend all persons suspected of capital crimes, I hereby\r\nseize the person of Ismenias as an arch-fomenter of war. I call upon\r\nyou, sirs, who are captains of companies, and you who are ranked with\r\nthem, to do your duty. Arise and secure the prisoner, and lead him away\r\nto the place appointed.\"\r\n\r\n (23) An ancient festival held by women in honour of Demeter and\r\n    Persephone ({to Thesmophoro}), who gave the first impulse to civil\r\n    society, lawful marriage, etc. See Herod. ii. 171; Diod. v. 5.\r\n\r\nThose who were privy to the affair, it will be understood, presented\r\nthemselves, and the orders were promptly carried out. Of those not in\r\nthe secret, but opposed to the party of Leontiades, some sought refuge\r\nat once outside the city in terror for their lives; whilst the rest,\r\nalbeit they retired to their houses at first, yet when they found\r\nthat Ismenias was imprisoned in the Cadmeia, and further delay seemed\r\ndangerous, retreated to Athens. These were the men who shared the views\r\nof Androcleidas and Ismenias, and they must have numbered about three\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nNow that the transactions were concluded, another polemarch was chosen\r\nin place of Ismenias, and Leontiades at once set out to Lacedaemon.\r\nThere he found the ephors and the mass of the community highly incensed\r\nagainst Phoebidas, \"who had failed to execute the orders assigned to\r\nhim by the state.\" Against this general indignation, however, Agesilaus\r\nprotested. (24) If mischief had been wrought to Lacedaemon by this deed,\r\nit was just that the doer of it should be punished; but, if good, it was\r\na time-honoured custom to allow full scope for impromptu acts of this\r\ncharacter. \"The sole point you have to look to,\" he urged, \"is whether\r\nwhat has been done is good or evil.\" After this, however, Leontiades\r\npresented himself to the assembly (25) and addressed the members as\r\nfollows: \"Sirs, Lacedaemonians, the hostile attitude of Thebes towards\r\nyou, before the occurrence of late events, was a topic constantly on\r\nyour lips, since time upon time your eyes were called upon to witness\r\nher friendly bearing to your foes in contrast with her hatred of your\r\nfriends. Can it be denied that Thebes refused to take part with you in\r\nthe campaign against your direst enemy, the democracy in Piraeus; and\r\nbalanced that lukewarmness by on onslaught on the Phocians, whose\r\nsole crime was cordiality to yourselves? (26) Nor is that all. In full\r\nknowledge that you were likely to be engaged in war with Olynthus, she\r\nproceeded at once to make an alliance with that city. So that up to the\r\nlast moment you were in constant expectation of hearing that the whole\r\nof Boeotia was laid at the feet of Thebes. With the late incidents all\r\nis changed. You need fear Thebes no longer. One brief despatch (27) in\r\ncipher will suffice to procure a dutiful subservience to your every wish\r\nin that quarter, provided only you will take as kindly an interest in us\r\nas we in you.\"\r\n\r\n (24) See \"Ages.\" vii.\r\n\r\n (25) \"Select Committee.\" See \"Hell.\" II. iv. 38; and below, VI. iii.\r\n    3.\r\n\r\n (26) See above, \"Hell.\" III. v. 4.\r\n\r\n (27) Lit. \"scytale.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeal told upon the meeting, and the Lacedaemonians (28) resolved\r\nformally, now that the citadel had been taken, to keep it, and to put\r\nIsmenias on his trial. In consequence of this resolution a body of\r\ncommissioners (29) was despatched, three Lacedaemonians and one for each\r\nof the allied states, great and small alike. The court of inquiry thus\r\nconstituted, the sittings commenced, and an indictment was preferred\r\nagainst Ismenias. He was accused of playing into the hands of the\r\nbarbarian; of seeking amity with the Persians to the detriment of\r\nHellas; of accepting sums of money as bribes from the king; and,\r\nfinally, of being, along with Androcleidas, the prime cause of the whole\r\nintestine trouble to which Hellas was a prey. Each of these charges was\r\nmet by the defendant, but to no purpose, since he failed to disabuse\r\nthe court of their conviction that the grandeur of his designs was only\r\nequalled by their wickedness. (30) The verdict was given against him,\r\nand he was put to death. The party of Leontiades thus possessed\r\nthe city; and went beyond the injunctions given them in the eager\r\nperformance of their services.\r\n\r\n (28) See Grote, \"H. G.\" vol. x. p. 85; Diod. xv. 20; Plut. \"Pelop.\"\r\n    vi.; ib. \"de Genio Socratis,\" V. vii. 6 A; Cor.

As a result of these transactions the Lacedaemonians pressed\r\non the combined campaign against Olynthus with still greater enthusiasm.\r\nThey not only set out Teleutias as governor, but by their united efforts\r\nfurnished him with an aggregate army of ten thousand men. (31) They\r\nalso sent despatches to the allied states, calling upon them to support\r\nTeleutias in accordance with the resolution of the allies. All the\r\nstates were ready to display devotion to Teleutias, and to do him\r\nservice, since he was a man who never forgot a service rendered him.\r\nNor was Thebes an exception; for was not the governor a brother\r\nof Agesilaus? Thebes, therefore, was enthusiastic in sending her\r\ncontribution of heavy infantry and cavalry. The Spartan conducted his\r\nmarch slowly and surely, taking the utmost pains to avoid injuring his\r\nfriends, and to collect as large a force as possible. He also sent a\r\nmessage in advance to Amyntas, begging him, if he were truly desirous of\r\nrecovering his empire, to raise a body of mercenaries, and to distribute\r\nsums of money among the neighbouring kings with a view to their\r\nalliance. Nor was that all. He sent also to Derdas, the ruler of Elimia,\r\npointing out to him that the Olynthians, having laid at their feet the\r\ngreat power of Macedonia, would certainly not suffer his lesser power\r\nto escape unless they were stayed up by force in arms in their career of\r\ninsolence. Proceeding thus, by the time he had reached the territory\r\nof the allied powers he was at the head of a very considerable army. At\r\nPotidaea he halted to make the necessary disposition of his troops, and\r\nthence advanced into the territory of the enemy. As he approached\r\nthe hostile city, he abstained from felling and firing alike, being\r\npersuaded that to do so was only to create difficulties in his own\r\npath, whether advancing or retreating; it would be time enough, when he\r\nretired from Olynthus, to fell the trees and lay them as a barrier in\r\nthe path of any assailant in the rear.\r\n\r\n (31) Lit. \"sent out along with him the combined force of ten thousand\r\n    men,\" in ref to S. 20 above.\r\n\r\nBeing now within a mile or so (32) of the city he came to a halt. The\r\nleft division was under his personal command, for it suited him to\r\nadvance in a line opposite the gate from which the enemy sallied; the\r\nother division of the allies stretched away to the right. The cavalry\r\nwere thus distributed: the Laconians, Thebans, and all the Macedonians\r\npresent were posted on the right. With his own division he kept Derdas\r\nand his troopers, four hundred strong. This he did partly out of genuine\r\nadmiration for this body of horse, and partly as a mark of courtesy to\r\nDerdas, which should make him not regret his coming.\r\n\r\n (32) Lit. \"ten stades.\"\r\n\r\nPresently the enemy issued forth and formed in line opposite, under\r\ncover of their walls. Then their cavalry formed in close order and\r\ncommenced the attack. Dashing down upon the Laconians and Boeotians they\r\ndismounted Polycharmus, the Lacedaemonian cavalry general, inflicting a\r\nhundred wounds on him as he lay on the ground, and cut down others, and\r\nfinally put to flight the cavalry on the right wing. The flight of these\r\ntroopers infected the infantry in close proximity to them, who in turn\r\nswerved; and it looked as if the whole army was about to be worsted,\r\nwhen Derdas at the head of his cavalry dashed straight at the gates of\r\nOlynthus, Teleutias supporting him with the troops of his division.\r\nThe Olynthian cavalry, seeing how matters were going, and in dread\r\nof finding the gates closed upon them, wheeled round and retired with\r\nalacrity. Thus it was that Derdas had his chance to cut down man after\r\nman as their cavalry ran the gauntlet past him. In the same way, too,\r\nthe infantry of the Olynthians retreated within their city, though,\r\nowing to the closeness of the walls in their case, their loss was\r\ntrifling. Teleutias claimed the victory, and a trophy was duly erected,\r\nafter which he turned his back on Olynthus and devoted himself to\r\nfelling the fruit-trees. This was the campaign of the summer. He\r\nnow dismissed both the Macedonians and the cavalry force of Derdas.\r\nIncursions, however, on the part of the Olynthians themselves against\r\nthe states allied to Lacedaemon were frequent; lands were pillaged, and\r\npeople put to the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nB.C. 381. With the first symptoms of approaching spring the Olynthian\r\ncavalry, six hundred strong, had swooped into the territory of\r\nApollonia--about the middle of the day--and dispersing over the\r\ndistrict, were employed in pillaging; but as luck would have it,\r\nDerdas had arrived that day with his troopers, and was breakfasting in\r\nApollonia. He noted the enemy's incursion, but kept quiet, biding his\r\ntime; his horses were ready saddled, and his troopers armed cap-a-pied.\r\nAs the Olynthians came galloping up contemptuously, not only into the\r\nsuburbs, but to the very gates of the city, he seized his opportunity,\r\nand with his compact and well-ordered squadron dashed out; whereupon the\r\ninvaders took to flight. Having once turned them, Derdas gave them no\r\nrespite, pursuing and slaughtering them for ten miles or more, (1) until\r\nhe had driven them for shelter within the very ramparts of Olynthus.\r\nReport said that Derdas slew something like eighty men in this affair.\r\nAfter this the Olynthians were more disposed to keep to their walls,\r\ncontenting themselves with tilling the merest corner of their territory.\r\n\r\n (1) Lit. \"ninety stades.\"\r\n\r\nTime advanced, and Teleutias was in conduct of another expedition\r\nagainst the city of Olynthus. His object was to destroy any timber\r\n(2) still left standing, or fields still cultivated in the hostile\r\nterritory. This brought out the Olynthian cavalry, who, stealthily\r\nadvancing, crossed the river which washes the walls of the town, and\r\nagain continued their silent march right up to the adversary's camp.\r\nAt sight of an audacity which nettled him, Teleutias at once ordered\r\nTlemonidas, the officer commanding his light infantry division, to\r\ncharge the assailants at the run. On their side the men of Olynthus,\r\nseeing the rapid approach of the light infantry, wheeled and quietly\r\nretired until they had recrossed the river, drawing the enemy on,\r\nwho followed with conspicuous hardihood. Arrogating to themselves the\r\nposition of pursuers towards fugitives, they did not hesitate to cross\r\nthe river which stood between them and their prey. Then the Olynthian\r\ncavalry, choosing a favourable moment, when those who had crossed seemed\r\neasy to deal with, wheeled and attacked them, putting Tlemonidas himself\r\nto the sword with more than a hundred others of his company. Teleutias,\r\nwhen he saw what was happening, snatched up his arms in a fit of anger\r\nand began leading his hoplites swiftly forward, ordering at the same\r\ntime his peltasts and cavalry to give chase and not to slacken. Their\r\nfate was the fate of many before and since, who, in the ardour of\r\npursuit, have come too close to the enemy's walls and found it hard to\r\nget back again. Under a hail of missiles from the walls they were forced\r\nto retire in disorder and with the necessity of guarding themselves\r\nagainst the missiles. At this juncture the Olynthians sent out their\r\ncavalry at full gallop, backed by supports of light infantry; and\r\nfinally their heavy infantry reserves poured out and fell upon the\r\nenemy's lines, now in thorough confusion. Here Teleutias fell fighting,\r\nand when that happened, without further pause the troops immediately\r\nabout him swerved. Not one soul longer cared to make a stand, but the\r\nflight became general, some fleeing towards Spartolus, others in the\r\ndirection of Acanthus, a third set seeking refuge within the walls of\r\nApollonia, and the majority within those of Potidaea. As the tide of\r\nfugitives broke into several streams, so also the pursuers divided\r\nthe work between them; this way and that they poured, dealing death\r\nwholesale. So perished the pith and kernel of the armament.\r\n\r\n (2) I.e. fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nSuch calamities are not indeed without a moral. The lesson they are\r\nmeant to teach mankind, I think, is plain. If in a general sense one\r\nought not to punish any one, even one's own slave, in anger--since\r\nthe master in his wrath may easily incur worse evil himself than he\r\ninflicts--so, in the case of antagonists in war, to attack an enemy\r\nunder the influence of passion rather than of judgment is an absolute\r\nerror. For wrath is but a blind impulse devoid of foresight, whereas to\r\nthe penetrating eye of reason a blow parried may be better than a wound\r\ninflicted. (3)\r\n\r\n (3) See, for the same sentiment, \"Horsemanship,\" vi. 13. See also\r\n    Plut. \"Pel.\" and \"Marc.\" (Clough, ii. p. 278).\r\n\r\nWhen the news of what had happened reached Lacedaemon it was agreed,\r\nafter due deliberation, that a force should be sent, and of no trifling\r\ndescription, if only to quench the victors' pride, and to prevent their\r\nown achievements from becoming null and void. In this determination they\r\nsent out King Agesipolis, as general, attended, like Agesilaus (4) on\r\nhis Asiatic campaign, by thirty Spartans. (5) Volunteers flocked to his\r\nstandard. They were partly the pick and flower of the provincials, (6)\r\npartly foreigners of the class called Trophimoi, (7) or lastly, bastard\r\nsons of Spartans, comely and beautiful of limb, and well versed in the\r\nlore of Spartan chivalry. The ranks of this invading force were further\r\nswelled by volunteers from the allied states, the Thessalians notably\r\ncontributing a corps of cavalry. All were animated by the desire of\r\nbecoming known to Agesipolis, so that even Amyntas and Derdas in zeal\r\nof service outdid themselves. With this promise of success Agesipolis\r\nmarched forward against Olynthus.\r\n\r\n (4) See above, \"Hell.\" III. iv. 2.\r\n\r\n (5) Lit. \"Spartiates.\" The new army was sent out B.C. 380, according\r\n    to Grote.\r\n\r\n (6) Lit. \"beautiful and brave of the Perioeci.\"\r\n\r\n (7) Xenophon's own sons educated at Sparta would belong to this class.\r\n    See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 91.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the state of Phlius, complimented by Agesipolis on the amount\r\nof the funds contributed by them to his expedition and the celerity with\r\nwhich the money had been raised, and in full belief that while one king\r\nwas in the field they were secure against the hostile attack of the\r\nother (since it was hardly to be expected that both kings should be\r\nabsent from Sparta at one moment), boldly desisted from doing justice\r\nby her lately reinstated citizens. On the one hand, these exiles claimed\r\nthat points in dispute should be determined before an impartial court\r\nof justice; the citizens, on the other, insisted on the claimants\r\nsubmitting the cases for trial in the city itself. And when the latter\r\ndemurred to that solution, asking \"What sort of trial that would be\r\nwhere the offenders were also the judges?\" they appealed to deaf\r\nears. Consequently the restored party appealed at Sparta, to prefer a\r\ncomplaint against their city. They were accompanied by other members of\r\nthe community, who stated that many of the Phliasians themselves besides\r\nthe appellants recognised the injustice of their treatment. The state of\r\nPhlius was indignant at this manouvre, and retaliated by imposing a fine\r\non all who had betaken themselves to Lacedaemon without a mandate from\r\nthe state. Those who incurred the fine hesitated to return home; they\r\npreferred to stay where they were and enforce their views: \"It is quite\r\nplain now who were the perpetrators of all the violence--the very\r\npeople who originally drove us into exile, and shut their gates upon\r\nLacedaemon; the confiscators of our property one day, the ruthless\r\nopponents of its restoration the next. Who else but they have now\r\nbrought it about that we should be fined for appearing at Lacedaemon?\r\nand for what purpose but to deter any one else for the future from\r\nventuring to expose the proceedings at Phlius?\" Thus far the appellants.\r\nAnd in good sooth the conduct of the men of Phlius did seem to savour of\r\ninsolence; so much so that the ephors called out the ban against them.\r\n\r\nB.C. 380. Nor was Agesilaus otherwise than well satisfied with\r\nthis decision, not only on the ground of old relations of friendly\r\nhospitality between his father Archidamus and the party of Podanemus,\r\nwho were numbered among the restored exiles at this time, but because\r\npersonally he was bound by similar ties himself towards the adherents\r\nof Procles, son of Hipponicus. The border sacrifices proving favourable,\r\nthe march commenced at once. As he advanced, embassy after embassy met\r\nhim, and would fain by presents of money avert invasion. But the king\r\nanswered that the purpose of his march was not to commit wrongdoing, but\r\nto protect the victims of injustice. Then the petitioners offered to do\r\nanything, only they begged him to forgo invasion. Again he replied--How\r\ncould he trust to their words when they had lied to him already? He\r\nmust have the warrant of acts, not promises. And being asked, \"What act\r\n(would satisfy him)?\" he answered once more, saying, \"The same which\r\nyou performed aforetime, and suffered no wrong at our hands\"--in other\r\nwords, the surrender of the acropolis. (8) But to this they could not\r\nbring themselves. Whereupon he invaded the territory of Phlius, and\r\npromptly drawing lines of circumvallation, commenced the siege. Many of\r\nthe Lacedaemonians objected, for the sake of a mere handful of wretched\r\npeople, so to embroil themselves with a state of over five thousand men.\r\n(9) For, indeed, to leave no doubt on this score, the men of Phlius met\r\nregularly in assembly in full view of those outside. But Agesilaus was\r\nnot to be beaten by this move. Whenever any of the townsmen came out,\r\ndrawn by friendship or kinship with the exiles, in every case the king's\r\ninstructions were to place the public messes (10) at the service of\r\nthe visitors, and, if they were willing to go through the course of\r\ngymnastic training, to give them enough to procure necessaries. All\r\nmembers of these classes were, by the general's strict injunctions,\r\nfurther to be provided with arms, and loans were to be raised for the\r\npurpose without delay. Presently the superintendents of this branch of\r\nthe service were able to turn out a detachment of over a thousand men,\r\nin the prime of bodily perfection, well disciplined and splendidly\r\narmed, so that in the end the Lacedaemonians affirmed: \"Fellow-soldiers\r\nof this stamp are too good to lose.\" Such were the concerns of\r\nAgesilaus.\r\n\r\n (8) See above, IV. iv. 15.\r\n\r\n (9) See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 45, note 4; and below, V. iv. 13.\r\n\r\n (10) See \"Pol. Lac.\" v.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Agesipolis on leaving Macedonia advanced straight upon\r\nOlynthus and took up a strategical position in front of the town.\r\nFinding that no one came out to oppose him, he occupied himself for the\r\npresent with pillaging any remnant of the district still intact, and with\r\nmarching into the territory allied with the enemy, where he destroyed\r\nthe corn. The town of Torone he attacked and took by storm. But while he\r\nwas so engaged, in the height of mid-summer he was attacked by a burning\r\nfever. In this condition his mind reverted to a scene once visited, the\r\ntemple of Dionysus at Aphytis, and a longing for its cool and sparkling\r\nwaters and embowered shades (11) seized him. To this spot accordingly\r\nhe was carried, still living, but only to breathe his last outside the\r\nsacred shrine, within a week of the day on which he sickened. His body\r\nwas laid in honey and conveyed home to Sparta, where he obtained royal\r\nsepulchre.\r\n\r\n (11) Lit. \"shady tabernacles.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached Agesilaus he displayed none of the satisfaction\r\nwhich might possibly have been expected at the removal of an antagonist.\r\nOn the contrary, he wept and pined for the companionship so severed, it\r\nbeing the fashion at Sparta for the kings when at home to mess together\r\nand to share the same quarters. Moreover, Agesipolis was admirably\r\nsuited to Agesilaus, sharing with the merriment of youth in tales of the\r\nchase and horsemanship and boyish loves; (12) while, to crown all, the\r\ntouch of reverence due from younger to elder was not wanting in their\r\ncommon life. In place of Agesipolis, the Lacedaemonians despatched\r\nPolybiades as governor to Olynthus.\r\n\r\n (12) See \"Ages.\" viii. 2.\r\n\r\nB.C. 379. Agesilaus had already exceeded the time during which the\r\nsupplies of food in Phlius were expected to last. The difference, in\r\nfact, between self-command and mere appetite is so great that the men of\r\nPhlius had only to pass a resolution to cut down the food expenditure by\r\none half, and by doing so were able to prolong the siege for twice\r\nthe calculated period. But if the contrast between self-restraint and\r\nappetite is so great, no less startling is that between boldness and\r\nfaint-heartedness. A Phliasian named Delphion, a real hero, it would\r\nseem, took to himself three hundred Phliasians, and not only succeeded\r\nin preventing the peace-party from carrying out their wishes, but was\r\nequal to the task of incarcerating and keeping safely under lock and key\r\nthose whom he mistrusted. Nor did his ability end there. He succeeded\r\nin forcing the mob of citizens to perform garrison duty, and by\r\nvigorous patrolling kept them constant to the work. Over and over again,\r\naccompanied by his personal attendants, he would dash out of the walls\r\nand drive in the enemy's outposts, first at one point and then at\r\nanother of the beleaguering circle. But the time eventually came when,\r\nsearch as they might by every means, these picked defenders (13) could\r\nfind no further store of food within the walls, and they were forced to\r\nsend to Agesilaus, requesting a truce for an embassy to visit Sparta,\r\nadding that they were resolved to leave it to the discretion of the\r\nauthorities at Lacedaemon to do with their city what they liked.\r\nAgesilaus granted a pass to the embassy, but, at the same time, he was\r\nso angry at their setting his personal authority aside, that he sent to\r\nhis friends at home and arranged that the fate of Phlius should be\r\nleft to his discretion. Meanwhile he proceeded to tighten the cordon of\r\ninvestment, so as to render it impossible that a single soul inside\r\nthe city should escape. In spite of this, however, Delphion, with\r\none comrade, a branded dare-devil, who had shown great dexterity\r\nin relieving the besieging parties of their arms, escaped by night.\r\nPresently the deputation returned with the answer from Lacedaemon that\r\nthe state simply left it entirely to the discretion of Agesilaus\r\nto decide the fate of Phlius as seemed to him best. Then Agesilaus\r\nannounced his verdict. A board of one hundred--fifty taken from the\r\nrestored exiles, fifty from those within the city--were in the first\r\nplace to make inquisition as to who deserved to live and who to\r\ndie, after which they were to lay down laws as the basis of a new\r\nconstitution. Pending the carrying out of these transactions, he left a\r\ndetachment of troops to garrison the place for six months, with pay\r\nfor that period. After this he dismissed the allied forces, and led the\r\nstate (14) division home. Thus the transactions concerning Phlius were\r\nbrought to a conclusion, having occupied altogether one year and eight\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n (13) See below, \"Hell.\" VII. i. 19.\r\n\r\n (14) {to politokon}, the citizen army. See above, IV. iv. 19; \"Pol.\r\n    Lac.\" xi.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Polybiades had reduced the citizens of Olynthus to the last\r\nstage of misery through famine. Unable to supply themselves with corn\r\nfrom their own land, or to import it by sea, they were forced to send an\r\nembassy to Lacedaemon to sue for peace. The plenipotentiaries on their\r\narrival accepted articles of agreement by which they bound themselves\r\nto have the same friends and the same foes as Lacedaemon, to follow her\r\nlead, and to be enrolled among her allies; and so, having taken an oath\r\nto abide by these terms, they returned home.\r\n\r\nOn every side the affairs of Lacedaemon had signally prospered: Thebes\r\nand the rest of the Boeotian states lay absolutely at her feet; Corinth\r\nhad become her most faithful ally; Argos, unable longer to avail herself\r\nof the subterfuge of a movable calendar, was humbled to the dust; Athens\r\nwas isolated; and, lastly, those of her own allies who displayed a\r\nhostile feeling towards her had been punished; so that, to all outward\r\nappearance, the foundations of her empire were at length absolutely well\r\nand firmly laid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAbundant examples might be found, alike in Hellenic and in foreign\r\nhistory, to prove that the Divine powers mark what is done amiss,\r\nwinking neither at impiety nor at the commission of unhallowed acts;\r\nbut at present I confine myself to the facts before me. (1) The\r\nLacedaemonians, who had pledged themselves by oath to leave the states\r\nindependent, had laid violent hands on the acropolis of Thebes, and were\r\neventually punished by the victims of that iniquity single-handed--the\r\nLacedaemonians, be it noted, who had never before been mastered by\r\nliving man; and not they alone, but those citizens of Thebes who\r\nintroduced them to their acropolis, and who wished to enslave their city\r\nto Lacedaemon, that they might play the tyrant themselves--how fared\r\nit with them? A bare score of the fugitives were sufficient to destroy\r\ntheir government. How this happened I will now narrate in detail.\r\n\r\n (1) Or, \"it is of my own subject that I must now speak.\" For the\r\n    \"peripety,\" or sudden reversal of circumstances, on which the plot\r\n    of the \"Hellenica\" hinges, see Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 100-108. Cf.\r\n    Soph. \"Oed. Tyr.\" 450; \"Antig.\" 1066; Thuc. v. 116; \"Hellenica\r\n    Essays,\" \"Xenophon,\" p. 382 foll. This passage is perhaps the key\r\n    to the historian's position.\r\n\r\nThere was a man named Phyllidas--he was secretary to Archias, that is,\r\nto the polemarchs. (2) Beyond his official duties, he had rendered his\r\nchief other services, and all apparently in an exemplary fashion. A\r\nvisit to Athens in pursuance of some business brought this man into\r\ncontact with a former acquaintance of his, Melon, one of the exiles\r\nwho had fled for safety to Athens. Melon had various questions to ask\r\ntouching the sort of tyranny practised by Archias in the exercise of the\r\npolemarchy, and by Philip. He soon discovered that affairs at home were\r\nstill more detestable to Phyllidas than to himself. It only remained\r\nto exchange pledges, and to arrange the details of what was to be done.\r\nAfter a certain interval Melon, accompanied by six of the trustiest\r\ncomrades he could find among his fellow-exiles, set off for Thebes. They\r\nwere armed with nothing but daggers, and first of all crept into the\r\nneighbourhood under cover of night. The whole of the next day they lay\r\nconcealed in a desert place, and drew near to the city gates in the\r\nguise of labourers returning home with the latest comers from the\r\nfields. Having got safely within the city, they spent the whole of that\r\nnight at the house of a man named Charon, and again the next day in the\r\nsame fashion. Phyllidas meanwhile was busily taken up with the concerns\r\nof the polemarchs, who were to celebrate a feast of Aphrodite on going\r\nout of office. Amongst other things, the secretary was to take this\r\nopportunity of fulfilling an old undertaking, which was the introduction\r\nof certain women to the polemarchs. They were to be the most majestic\r\nand the most beautiful to be found in Thebes. The polemarchs, on their\r\nside (and the character of the men is sufficiently marked), were looking\r\nforward to the pleasures of the night with joyful anticipation. Supper\r\nwas over, and thanks to the zeal with which the master of the ceremonies\r\nresponded to their mood, they were speedily intoxicated. To their\r\noft-repeated orders to introduce their mistresses, he went out and\r\nfetched Melon and the rest, three of them dressed up as ladies and the\r\nrest as their attendant maidens. Having brought them into the treasury\r\nof the polemarchs' residence, (3) he returned himself and announced to\r\nArchias and his friends that the women would not present themselves\r\nas long as any of the attendants remained in the room; whereupon they\r\npromptly bade all withdraw, and Phyllidas, furnishing the servants with\r\na stoup of wine, sent them off to the house of one of them. And now at\r\nlast he introduced the mistresses, and led them to their seats beside\r\ntheir respective lords. It was preconcerted that as soon as they were\r\nseated they were to throw aside their veils and strike home. That is one\r\nversion of the death of the polemarchs. (4) According to another, Melon\r\nand his friends came in as revellers, and so despatched their victims.\r\n\r\n (2) Lit. \"to Archias and his (polemarchs)\"; but the Greek phrase does\r\n    not, as the English would, imply that there were actually more\r\n    than two polemarchs, viz. Archias and Philippus. Hypates and\r\n    Leontiades belonged to the faction, but were neither of them\r\n    polemarchs.\r\n\r\n (3) Lit. \"Polemarcheion.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"and so, according to the prevalent version of the matter, the\r\n    polemarchs were slain. But some say that...\"\r\n\r\nThat over, Phyllidas, with three of the band, set off to the house of\r\nLeontiades. Arrived there, he knocked on the door, and sent in word that\r\nhe had a message from the polemarchs. Leontiades, as chance befell, was\r\nstill reclining in privacy after dinner, and his wife was seated beside\r\nhim working wools. The fidelity of Phyllidas was well known to him, and\r\nhe gave orders to admit him at once. They entered, slew Leontiades, and\r\nwith threats silenced his wife. As they went out they ordered the door\r\nto be shut, threatening that if they found it open they would kill every\r\none in the house. And now that this deed was done, Phyllidas, with two\r\nof the band, presented himself at the prison, telling the gaoler he had\r\nbrought a man from the polemarchs to be locked up. The gaoler opened the\r\ndoor, and was at once despatched, and the prisoners were released. These\r\nthey speedily supplied with arms taken from the armoury in the stoa,\r\nand then led them to the Ampheion, (5) and bade them take up a position\r\nthere, after which they at once made a proclamation calling on all\r\nThebans to come out, horse and foot, seeing that the tyrants were dead.\r\nThe citizens, indeed, as long as it was night, not knowing whom or\r\nwhat to trust, kept quiet, but when day dawned and revealed what had\r\noccurred, the summons was responded to with alacrity, heavy infantry and\r\ncavalry under arms alike sallying forth. Horsemen were also despatched\r\nby the now restored exiles to the two Athenian generals on the frontier;\r\nand they, being aware of the object of the message (promptly responded).\r\n(6)\r\n\r\n (5) See plan of Thebes, \"Dict. Geog.\"; Arrian, \"Anab.\" i. 8; Aesch.\r\n    \"Sept. c. Theb.\" 528.\r\n\r\n (6) Supply {epeboethoun}. There is a lacuna in the MSS. at this point.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Lacedaemonian governor in the citadel, as soon\r\nas that night's proclamation reached his ears, was not slow to send\r\nto Plataeae (7) and Thespiae for reinforcements. The approach of the\r\nPlataeans was perceived by the Theban cavalry, who met them and killed a\r\nscore of them and more, and after that achievement returned to the\r\ncity, to find the Athenians from the frontier already arrived. Then they\r\nassaulted the acropolis. The troops within recognised the paucity of\r\ntheir own numbers, whilst the zeal of their opponents (one and all\r\nadvancing to the attack) was plainly visible, and loud were the\r\nproclamations, promising rewards to those who should be first to scale\r\nthe walls. All this so worked upon their fears that they agreed to\r\nevacuate the place if the citizens would allow them a safe-conduct to\r\nretire with their arms. To this request the others gladly yielded, and\r\nthey made a truce. Oaths were taken on the terms aforesaid, and the\r\ncitizens dismissed their adversaries. For all that, as the garrison\r\nretired, those of them who were recognised as personal foes were seized\r\nand put to death. Some were rescued through the good offices of the\r\nAthenian reinforcements from the frontier, who smuggled them across and\r\nsaved them. The Thebans were not content with putting the men to\r\ndeath; if any of them had children, these also were sacrificed to their\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\n (7) This city had been refounded in B.C. 386 (Isocr. \"Plat.\" 20, 21).\r\n    See Freeman, op. cit. ch. iv. p. 170: \"Its restoration implied not\r\n    only a loss of Theban supremacy, but the actual loss of that\r\n    portion of the existing Theban territory which had formerly formed\r\n    the Plataian district.\"\r\n\r\nB.C. 378. When the news of these proceedings reached Sparta the first\r\nthing the Lacedaemonians did was to put to death the governor, who had\r\nabandoned the Cadmeia instead of awaiting reinforcements, and the next\r\nwas to call out the ban against Thebes. Agesilaus had little taste to\r\nhead the expedition; he pointed out that he had seen more than forty\r\nyears' service, (8) and that the exemption from foreign duty applicable\r\nto others at that age was applicable on the same principle to the king.\r\nSuch were the ostensible grounds on which he excused himself from the\r\npresent expedition, but his real objections lay deeper. He felt certain\r\nthat if he led the expedition his fellow-citizens would say: \"Agesilaus\r\ncaused all this trouble to the state in order to aid and abet tyrants.\"\r\nTherefore he preferred to leave his countrymen to settle the matter\r\nthemselves as they liked. Accordingly the ephors, instructed by\r\nthe Theban exiles who had escaped the late massacres, despatched\r\nCleombrotus. He had not commanded before, and it was the depth of\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n (8) And was therefore more than fifty-eight years old at this date.\r\n    See \"Ages.\" i. 6.\r\n\r\nNow while Chabrias, with a body of Athenian peltasts, kept watch and\r\nward over the road through Eleutherae, Cleombrotus made his way up by\r\nthe direct route to Plataeae. His column of light infantry, pushing\r\nforward in advance, fell upon the men who had been released from the\r\nTheban prison, guarding the summit, to the number of about one hundred\r\nand fifty. These, with the exception of one or two who escaped, were cut\r\ndown by the peltasts, and Cleombrotus descended in person upon Plataeae,\r\nwhich was still friendly to Sparta. Presently he reached Thespiae, and\r\nthat was the base for an advance upon Cynoscephalae, where he encamped\r\non Theban territory. Here he halted sixteen days, and then again fell\r\nback upon Thespiae. At this latter place he now left Sphodrias as\r\ngovernor, with a third portion of each of the contingents of the allies,\r\nhanding over to him all the moneys he had brought with him from\r\nhome, with directions to supplement his force with a contingent of\r\nmercenaries.\r\n\r\nWhile Sphodrias was so employed, Cleombrotus himself commenced his\r\nhomeward march, following the road through Creusis at the head of his\r\nown moiety of the troops, who indeed were in considerable perplexity to\r\ndiscover whether they were at war with the Thebans or at peace, seeing\r\nthat the general had led his army into Theban territory, had inflicted\r\nthe minimum of mischief, and again retired. No sooner, however, was his\r\nback turned than a violent wind storm assailed him in his rear, which\r\nsome construed as an omen clearly significant of what was about to take\r\nplace. Many a blow this assailant dealt them, and as the general and his\r\narmy, crossing from Creusis, scaled that face of the mountain (9) which\r\nstretches seaward, the blast hurled headlong from the precipices a\r\nstring of asses, baggage and all: countless arms were wrested from the\r\nbearers' grasp and whirled into the sea; finally, numbers of the men,\r\nunable to march with their arms, deposited them at different points of\r\nthe pass, first filling the hollow of their shields with stones. For the\r\nmoment, then, they halted at Aegosthena, on Megarian soil, and supped as\r\nbest they could. Next day they returned and recovered their arms.\r\nAfter this adventure the contingents lost no time in returning to their\r\nseveral homes, as Cleombrotus disbanded them.\r\n\r\n (9) I.e. \"Cithaeron.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at Athens and Thebes alike fear reigned. To the Athenians the\r\nstrength of the Lacedaemonians was unmistakable: the war was plainly\r\nno longer confined to Corinth; on the contrary, the Lacedaemonians had\r\nventured to skirt Athenian territory and to invade Thebes. They were so\r\nworked upon by their alarm that the two generals who had been privy\r\nto the insurrection of Melon against Leontiades and his party had to\r\nsuffer: the one was formally tried and put to death; the other, refusing\r\nto abide his trial, was banished.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions of the Thebans were of a different sort: their fear\r\nwas rather lest they should find themselves in single-handed war with\r\nLacedaemon. To prevent this they hit upon the following expedient. They\r\nworked upon Sphodrias, (10) the Spartan governor left in Thespiae, by\r\noffering him, as at least was suspected, a substantial sum, in return\r\nfor which he was to make an incursion into Attica; their great object\r\nbeing to involve Athens and Lacedaemon in hostilities. Sphodrias lent a\r\nwilling ear, and, pretending that he could easily capture Piraeus in its\r\npresent gateless condition, gave his troops an early evening meal and\r\nmarched out of Thespiae, saying that he would reach Piraeus before\r\ndaybreak. As a matter of fact day overtook him at Thria, nor did he\r\ntake any pains even to draw a veil over his intentions; on the contrary,\r\nbeing forced to turn aside, he amused himself by recklessly lifting\r\ncattle and sacking houses. Meanwhile some who chanced upon him in the\r\nnight had fled to the city and brought news to the men of Athens that a\r\nlarge body of troops was approaching. It needs no saying with what speed\r\nthe cavalry and heavy infantry armed themselves and stood on guard\r\nto protect the city. As chance befell, there were some Lacedaemonian\r\nambassadors in Athens at the moment, at the house of Callias their\r\nproxenos; their names were Etymocles, Aristolochus, and Ocyllus.\r\nImmediately on receipt of the news the Athenians seized these three and\r\nimprisoned them, as not improbably concerned in the plot. Utterly taken\r\naback by the affair themselves, the ambassadors pleaded that, had they\r\nbeen aware of an attempt to seize Piraeus, they would hardly have been\r\nso foolish as to put themselves into the power of the Athenians, or have\r\nselected the house of their proxenos for protection, where they were so\r\neasily to be found. It would, they further urged, soon be plain to the\r\nAthenians themselves that the state of Lacedaemon was quite as\r\nlittle cognisant of these proceedings as they. \"You will hear before\r\nlong\"--such was their confident prediction--\"that Sphodrias has paid for\r\nhis behaviour by his life.\" On this wise the ambassadors were acquitted\r\nof all concern in the matter and dismissed. Sphodrias himself was\r\nrecalled and indicted by the ephors on the capital charge, and, in spite\r\nof his refusal to face the trial, he was acquitted. This miscarriage\r\nof justice, as it seemed to many, who described it as unprecedented in\r\nLacedaemon, has an explanation.\r\n\r\n (10) See Plut. \"Pel.\" xiv. (Clough, ii. p. 214).\r\n\r\nSphodrias had a son named Cleonymus. He was just at the age when\r\nyouth emerges from boyhood, very handsome and of high repute among\r\nhis fellows. To this youth Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus, was\r\npassionately attached. Now the friends of Cleombrotus, as comrades of\r\nSphodrias, were disposed to acquit him; but they feared Agesilaus and\r\nhis friends, not to mention the intermediate party, for the enormity of\r\nhis proceeding was clear. So when Sphodrias addressed his son Cleonymus:\r\n\"You have it in your power, my son, to save your father, if you will, by\r\nbegging Archidamus to dispose Agesilaus favourably to me at my trial.\"\r\nThus instructed, the youth did not shrink from visiting Archidamus, and\r\nimplored him for his sake to save his father. Now when Archidamus saw\r\nhow Cleonymus wept, he too was melted to tears as he stood beside him,\r\nbut to his petition he made answer thus: \"Nay, Cleonymus, it is the bare\r\ntruth I tell you, I cannot so much as look my father in the face;\r\n(11) if I wished anything transacted for me in the city I would beg\r\nassistance from the whole world sooner than from my father. Still, since\r\nit is you who bid me, rest assured I will do my best to bring this about\r\nfor you as you desire.\" He then left the common hall (12) and retired\r\nhome to rest, but with dawn he arose and kept watch that his father\r\nmight not go out without his knowledge. Presently, when he saw him\r\nready to go forth, first some citizen was present, and then another and\r\nanother; and in each case he stepped aside, while they held his father\r\nin conversation. By and by a stranger would come, and then another; and\r\nso it went on until he even found himself making way for a string of\r\npetitioning attendants. At last, when his father had turned his back on\r\nthe Eurotas, and was entering his house again, he was fain to turn his\r\nback also and be gone without so much as accosting him. The next day\r\nhe fared no better: all happened as on the previous day. Now Agesilaus,\r\nalthough he had his suspicions why his son went to and fro in this way,\r\nasked no questions, but left him to take his own course. Archidamus, on\r\nhis side, was longing, as was natural, to see his friend Cleonymus; but\r\nhow he was to visit him, without having held the desired conversation\r\nwith his father, he knew not. The friends of Sphodrias, observing that\r\nhe who was once so frequent a visitor had ceased coming, were in agony;\r\nhe must surely have been deterred by the reproaches of his father. At\r\nlast, however, Archidamus dared to go to his father, and said, \"Father,\r\nCleonymus bids me ask you to save his father; grant me this boon, if\r\npossible, I beg you.\" He answered: \"For yourself, my son, I can make\r\nexcuse, but how shall my city make excuse for me if I fail to condemn\r\nthat man who, for his own base purpose, traffics to the injury of the\r\nstate?\" For the moment the other made no reply, but retired crestfallen\r\nbefore the verdict of justice. Afterwards, whether the thought was his\r\nown or that he was prompted by some other, he came and said, \"Father,\r\nif Sphodrias had done no wrong you would have released him, that I know;\r\nbut now, if he has done something wrong, may he not be excused by you\r\nfor our sakes?\" And the father answered: \"If it can be done without loss\r\nof honour on our parts, so shall it be.\" At that word the young man, in\r\ndeep despondency, turned and went. Now one of the friends of Sphodrias,\r\nconversing with Etymocles, remarked to him: \"You are all bent on putting\r\nSphodrias to death, I take it, you friends of Agesilaus?\" And Etymocles\r\nreplied: \"If that be so, we all are bent on one thing, and Agesilaus on\r\nanother, since in all his conversations he still harps upon one string:\r\nthat Sphodrias has done a wrong there is no denying, yet Sphodrias is\r\na man who, from boyhood to ripe manhood, (13) was ever constant to the\r\ncall of honour. To put such a man as that to death is hard; nay, Sparta\r\nneeds such soldiers.\" The other accordingly went off and reported what\r\nhe had just heard to Cleonymus; and he in the joy of his heart went\r\nstraightway to Archidamus and said: \"Now we know that you care for us;\r\nrest assured, Archidamus, that we in turn will take great pains that you\r\nshall never have cause to blush for our friendship.\" Nor did his acts\r\nbelie his words; but so long as he lived he was ever faithful to the\r\ncode of Spartan chivalry; and at Leuctra, fighting in front of the king\r\nside by side with Deinon the polemarch, thrice fell or ever he yielded\r\nup his breath--foremost of the citizens amidst the foe. And so, albeit\r\nhe caused his friend the bitterest sorrow, yet to that which he had\r\npromised he was faithful, seeing he wrought Archidamus no shame, but\r\ncontrariwise shed lustre on him. (14) In this way Sphodrias obtained his\r\nacquittal.\r\n\r\n (11) See \"Cyrop.\" I. iv. 12.\r\n\r\n (12) Lit. \"the Philition.\" See \"Pol.

Lac.\" ii. iii. iv.\r\n\r\n (14) I.e. both in life and in death.\r\n\r\nAt Athens the friends of Boeotia were not slow to instruct the people\r\nthat his countrymen, so far from punishing Sphodrias, had even applauded\r\nhim for his designs on Athens; and in consequence of this the Athenians\r\nnot only furnished Piraeus with gates, but set to work to build a fleet,\r\nand displayed great zeal in sending aid to the Boeotians. (15) The\r\nLacedaemonians, on their side, called out the ban against the Thebans;\r\nand being persuaded that in Agesilaus they would find a more prudent\r\ngeneral than Cleombrotus had proved, they begged the former to undertake\r\nthe expedition. (16) He, replying that the wish of the state was for him\r\nlaw, began making preparations to take the field.\r\n\r\n (15) For the new Athenian confederacy of Delos of this year, B.C. 378,\r\n    see \"Pol. Lac.\" xiv. 6; \"Rev.\" v. 6; Diod. xv. 28-30; Plut.\r\n    \"Pelop.\" xv.; Hicks, 78, 81; and for an alliance between Athens\r\n    and Chalcis in Euboea, see Hicks, 79; and for a treaty with Chios,\r\n    Hicks, 80.\r\n\r\n (16) See \"Ages.\" ii. 22.\r\n\r\nNow he had come to the conclusion that without the occupation of Mount\r\nCithaeron any attack on Thebes would be difficult. Learning then that\r\nthe men of Cleitor were just now at war with the men of Orchomenus, (17)\r\nand were maintaining a foreign brigade, he came to an understanding with\r\nthe Cleitorians that in the event of his needing it, this force would be\r\nat his service; and as soon as the sacrifices for crossing the\r\nfrontier proved favourable, he sent to the commander of the Cleitorian\r\nmercenaries, and handing him a month's pay, ordered him to occupy\r\nCithaeron with his men. This was before he himself reached Tegea.\r\nMeanwhile he sent a message to the men of Orchomenus that so long as\r\nthe campaign lasted they must cease from war. If any city during his\r\ncampaign abroad took on itself to march against another city, his first\r\nduty, he declared, would be to march against such offending city in\r\naccordance with a decree of the allies.\r\n\r\n (17) In Arcadia. See Busolt, \"Die Lak.\" 120 foll.\r\n\r\nThus crossing Cithaeron he reached Thespiae, (18) and from that base\r\nmade the territory of Thebes his objective. Finding the great plain\r\nfenced round with ditch and palisade, as also the most valuable portions\r\nof the country, he adopted the plan of shifting his encampment from one\r\nplace to another. Regularly each day, after the morning meal, he marched\r\nout his troops and ravaged the territory, confining himself to his own\r\nside of the palisadings and trench. The appearance of Agesilaus at any\r\npoint whatever was a signal to the enemy, who within the circuit of his\r\nentrenchment kept moving in parallel line to the invader, and was ever\r\nready to defend the threatened point. On one occasion, the Spartan\r\nking having retired and being well on the road back to camp, the Theban\r\ncavalry, hitherto invisible, suddenly dashed out, following one of the\r\nregularly constructed roads out of the entrenchment. Taking advantage of\r\nthe enemy's position--his light troops breaking off to supper or busily\r\npreparing the meal, and the cavalry, some of them on their legs just\r\n(19) dismounted, and others in the act of mounting--on they rode,\r\npressing the charge home. Man after man of the light troops was cut\r\ndown; and three cavalry troopers besides--two Spartans, Cleas and\r\nEpicydidas by name, and the third a provincial (20) named Eudicus, who\r\nhad not had time to mount their horses, and whose fate was shared by\r\nsome Theban (21) exiles. But presently Agesilaus wheeled about and\r\nadvanced with his heavy infantry to the succour; his cavalry dashed\r\nat the enemy's cavalry, and the flower of the heavy infantry, the\r\nten-years-service men, charged by their side. The Theban cavalry at that\r\ninstant looked like men who had been imbibing too freely in the noontide\r\nheat--that is to say, they awaited the charge long enough to hurl their\r\nspears; but the volley sped without effect, and wheeling about within\r\nthat distance they left twelve of their number dead upon the field.\r\n\r\n (18) By Cynoscephalae.

Turning the observation to\r\naccount, he offered sacrifice with day's dawn, and marched with all\r\npossible speed, and so crossed within the palisadings, through what\r\nmight have been a desert, as far as defence or sign of living being\r\nwent. Once well inside, he proceeded to cut down and set on fire\r\neverything up to the city gates. After this exploit he beat a retreat,\r\nretiring into Thespiae, where he fortified their citadel for them. Here\r\nhe left Phoebidas as governor, while he himself crossed the passes back\r\ninto Megara. Arrived here he disbanded the allies, and led the city\r\ntroops homewards.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Agesilaus, Phoebidas devoted himself to harrying\r\nthe Thebans by sending out robber bands, and laid waste their land by\r\na system of regular incursions. The Thebans, on their side, desiring\r\nto retaliate, marched out with their whole force into the territory\r\nof Thespiae. But once well inside the district they found themselves\r\nclosely beset by Phoebidas and his light troops, who would not give\r\nthem the slightest chance to scatter from their main body, so that\r\nthe Thebans, heartily vexed at the turn their foray had taken, beat a\r\nretreat quicker than they had come. The muleteers threw away with their\r\nown hands the fruits they had captured, in their anxiety to get home as\r\nquickly as possible; so dire a dread had fallen upon the invading army.\r\nThis was the chance for the Spartan to press home his attack boldly,\r\nkeeping his light division in close attendance on himself, and leaving\r\nthe heavy infantry under orders to follow him in battle order. He was\r\nin hopes even that he might put the enemy to complete rout, so valiantly\r\ndid he lead the advance, encouraging the light troops to \"come to a\r\nclose grip with the invadors,\" or summoning the heavy infantry of the\r\nThespiaeans to \"bring up their supports.\" Presently the Theban cavalry\r\nas they retired found themselves face to face with an impassable glen\r\nor ravine, where in the first instance they collected in a mob, and next\r\nwheeled right-about-face in sheer resourcelessness where to cross. The\r\nhandful of light troops who formed the Spartan vanguard took fright\r\nat the Thebans and fled, and the Theban horsemen seeing this put in\r\npractice the lesson of attack which the fugitives taught them. As for\r\nPhoebidas himself, he and two or three with him fell sword in hand,\r\nwhereupon his mercenary troops all took to their heels.\r\n\r\nWhen the stream of fugitives reached the Thespiaean heavy infantry\r\nreserves, they too, in spite of much boasting beforehand that they would\r\nnever yield to Thebans, took to flight, though there was now absolutely\r\nno pursuit whatever, for it was now late. The number slain was not\r\nlarge, but, for all that, the men of Thespiae did not come to a\r\nstandstill until they found themselves safe inside their walls. As a\r\nsequel, the hopes and spirits of the Thebans were again kindled into new\r\nlife, and they made campaigns against Thespiae and the other provincial\r\ncities of Boeotia. (22) It must be admitted that in each case the\r\ndemocratical party retired from these cities to Thebes; since absolute\r\ngovernments had been established in all of them on the pattern\r\npreviously adopted at Thebes; and the result was that the friends of\r\nLacedaemon in these cities also needed her assistance. (23) After the\r\ndeath of Phoebidas the Lacedaemonians despatched a polemarch with a\r\ndivision by sea to form the garrison of Thespiae.\r\n\r\n (22) Lit. \"their other perioecid cities.\" For the significance of this\r\n    title as applied by the Thebans (and perhaps commonly) to the\r\n    other cities of Boeotia, see Freeman, op. cit. ch. iv. pp. 157,\r\n    173 foll.\r\n\r\n (23) See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 174; Freeman, op. cit. iv. 171, 172.\r\n\r\nB.C. 377. With the advent of spring (24) the ephors again called out the\r\nban against Thebes, and requested Agesilaus to lead the expedition, as\r\non the former campaign. He, holding to his former theory with regard to\r\nthe invasion, even before sacrificing the customary frontier sacrifice,\r\nsent a despatch to the polemarch at Thespiae, with orders to seize the\r\npass which commands the road over Cithaeron, and to guard it against his\r\narrival. Then, having once more crossed the pass and reached Plataeae,\r\nhe again made a feint of marching first into Thespiae, and so sent a\r\ndespatch ordering supplies to be in readiness, and all embassies to\r\nbe waiting his arrival there; so that the Thebans concentrated their\r\nattention on the approaches from Thespiae, which they strongly guarded.\r\nNext morning, however, Agesilaus sacrificed at daybreak and set out on\r\nthe road to Erythrae, (25) and completing in one day what was a good two\r\ndays' march for an army, gave the Thebans the slip, and crossed\r\ntheir palisade-work at Scolus before the enemy had arrived from the\r\nclosely-guarded point at which he had effected his entrance formerly.\r\nThis done he proceeded to ravage the eastward-facing districts of the\r\ncity of Thebes as far as the territory of Tanagra, for at that date\r\nTanagra was still in the hands of Hypatodorus and his party, who were\r\nfriends of the Lacedaemonians. After that he turned to retire, keeping\r\nthe walls of Thebes on his left. But the Thebans, who had stolen, as\r\nit were, upon the scene, drew up at the spot called \"The Old Wife's\r\nBreast,\" (26) keeping the trench and palisading in their rear: they were\r\npersuaded that here, if anywhere, lay their chance to risk a decisive\r\nengagement, the ground at this point being somewhat narrow and difficult\r\nto traverse. Agesilaus, however, in view of the situation, refused to\r\naccept the challenge. Instead of marching upon them he turned sharp off\r\nin the direction of the city; and the Thebans, in alarm for the city in\r\nits undefended state, abandoned the favourable ground on which they\r\nwere drawn up in battle line, and retired at the double towards the city\r\nalong the road to Potniae, which seemed the safer route. This last\r\nmove of Agesilaus may be described as a stroke of genius: (27) while it\r\nallowed him to retire to a distance, it forced the enemy themselves\r\nto retreat at the double. In spite of this, however, one or two of the\r\npolemarchs, with their divisions, charged the foe as he raced past.\r\nBut again the Thebans, from the vantage-ground of their heights, sent\r\nvolleys of spears upon the assailants, which cost one of the polemarchs,\r\nAlypetus, his life. He fell pierced by a spear. But again from this\r\nparticular crest the Thebans on their side were forced to turn in\r\nflight; so much so that the Sciritae, with some of the cavalry, scaled\r\nup and speedily cut down the rearmost ranks of the Thebans as they\r\ngalloped past into the city. When, however, they were close under\r\ncover of their walls the Thebans turned, and the Sciritae seeing them\r\nretreated at more than a steady walking pace. No one, it is true, was\r\nslain; but the Thebans all the same set up a trophy in record of\r\nthe incident at the point where the scaling party had been forced to\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n (24) See for affairs of Delos, never actually named by Xenophon,\r\n    between B.C. 377 and 374, the Sandwich Marble in Trinity College,\r\n    Cambridge; Boeckh, \"C.

The light troops, who\r\nformed a free corps in the pay of the Thebans, hung audaciously at his\r\nheels. Their shouts could be heard calling out to Chabrias (28) for not\r\nbringing up his supports; when the cavalry of the Olynthians (who now\r\ncontributed a contingent in accordance with their oaths) (29) wheeled\r\nround on them, caught the pursuers in the heat of their pursuit, and\r\ndrove them uphill, putting large numbers of them to the sword--so\r\nquickly are infantry overhauled by cavalry on steep ground which can be\r\nridden over. Being arrived within the walls of Thespiae, Agesilaus\r\nfound the citizens in a state of party feud, the men of Lacedaemonian\r\nproclivities desiring to put their political opponents, one of whom was\r\nMenon, to death (30)--a proceeding which Agesilaus would not sanction.\r\nAfter having healed their differences and bound them over by solemn oath\r\nto keep the peace with one another, he at once retired, taking his\r\nold route across Cithaeron to Megara. Here once more he disbanded the\r\nallies, and at the head of the city troops himself marched back to\r\nSparta.\r\n\r\n (28) For the exploits of Chabrias, who commanded a division of mixed\r\n    Athenians and mercenaries (see above, S. 14), see Dem. \"c.

But while these\r\ncommissioners were engaged in effecting their purchases, Alcetas, the\r\nLacedaemonian who was garrisoning Oreus, (32) fitted out three triremes,\r\ntaking precautions that no rumour of his proceedings should leak out.\r\nAs soon as the corn was shipped and the vessels under weigh, he captured\r\nnot only the corn but the triremes, escort and all, numbering no less\r\nthan three hundred men. This done he locked up his prisoners in the\r\ncitadel, where he himself was also quartered. Now there was a youth, the\r\nson of a native of Oreus, fair of mien and of gentle breeding, (33) who\r\ndanced attendance on the commandant: and the latter must needs leave the\r\ncitadel and go down to busy himself with this youth. This was a piece of\r\ncarelessness which the prisoners did not fail to observe, and turned to\r\ngood account by seizing the citadel, whereupon the town revolted,\r\nand the Thebans experienced no further difficulty in obtaining corn\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\n (31) = 2,437 pounds: 10 shillings.\r\n\r\n (32) Oreus, formerly called Histiaea, in the north of Euboea.

The history of the case is this: During the withdrawal of his\r\narmy from Thebes the year before, when at Megara, while mounting from\r\nthe Aphrodision (34) to the Government house he ruptured a vein or other\r\nvessel of the body. This was followed by a rush of blood to his sound\r\nleg. The knee was much swelled, and the pain intolerable, until a\r\nSyracusan surgeon made an incision in the vein near the ankle. The blood\r\nthus let flowed night and day; do what they could to stop the discharge,\r\nall failed, till the patient fainted away; then it ceased. In this\r\nplight Agesilaus was conveyed home on a litter to Lacedaemon, and\r\nremained an invalid the rest of that summer and throughout the winter.\r\n\r\n (34) Pausanius (I. xi. 6) mentions a temple of Aphrodite\r\n    {'Epistrophoa} (Verticordia), on the way up to the Carian\r\n    Acropolis of Megara.\r\n\r\nBut to resume: at the first burst of spring the Lacedaemonians\r\nagain called out the ban, and gave orders to Cleombrotus to lead the\r\nexpedition. The king found himself presently with his troops at the foot\r\nof Cithaeron, and his light infantry advanced to occupy the pass which\r\ncommands the road. But here they found a detachment of Thebans and\r\nAthenians already in occupation of the desired height, who for a while\r\nsuffered them to approach; but when they were close upon them, sprang\r\nfrom their position and charged, putting about forty to the sword. This\r\nincident was sufficient to convince Cleombrotus that to invade Thebes by\r\nthis mountain passage was out of the question, and in this faith he led\r\nback and disbanded his troops.\r\n\r\nThe allies met in Lacedaemon, and arguments were adduced on the part of\r\nthe allies to show that faintheartedness would very soon lead to their\r\nbeing absolutely worn out by the war. They had got it in their power,\r\nit was urged, to fit out a fleet far outnumbering that of Athens, and\r\nto reduce that city by starvation; it was open to them, in the self-same\r\nships, to carry an army across into Theban territory, and they had\r\na choice of routes--the road into Phocis, or, if they preferred, by\r\nCreusis. After thus carefully considering the matter they manned a fleet\r\nof sixty triremes, and Pollis was appointed admiral in command. Nor\r\nindeed were their expectations altogether belied. The Athenians were\r\nsoon so closely blockaded that their corn vessels could get no farther\r\nthan Geraestus; (35) there was no inducing them to coast down father\r\nsouth, with a Lacedaemonian navy hovering about Aegina and Ceos and\r\nAndros. The Athenians, making a virtue of necessity, manned their ships\r\nin person, gave battle to Pollis under the leadership of Chabrias, and\r\ncame out of the sea-fight (36) victorious.\r\n\r\n (35) The promontory at the southern extremity of Euboea.\r\n\r\n (36) Battle of Naxos, B.C. 376. For interesting details, see Diod. xv.\r\n    35, 35.\r\n\r\nB.C. 375. Then the corn supplies flowed freely into Athens. The\r\nLacedaemonians, on their side, were preparing to transport an army\r\nacross the water into Boeotia, when the Thebans sent a request to the\r\nAthenians urging them to despatch an armament round Peloponnesus, under\r\nthe persuasion that if this were done the Lacedaemonians would find it\r\nimpossible at once to guard their own or the allied territory in that\r\npart of the world, and at the same time to convery an army of any size\r\nto operate against Thebes. The proposals fell in with the present temper\r\nof the Athenians, irritated with Lacedaemon on account of the exploit\r\nof Sphodrias. Accordingly they eagerly manned a fleet of sixty vessels,\r\nappointing Timotheus as admiral in command, and despatched it on a\r\ncruise round Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans, seeing that there had been no hostile invasion of their\r\nterritory for so long (neither during the campaign of Cleombrotus\r\nnor now, (37) whilst Timotheus prosecuted his coasting voyage), felt\r\nemboldened to carry out a campaign on their own account against the\r\nprovincial cities; (38) and one by one they again recovered them.\r\n\r\n (37) Lit. \"nor at the date of Timotherus's periplus.\" To the historian\r\n    writing of the events of this period several years later, the\r\n    coasting voyage of Timotheus is a single incident ({periepleuse}),\r\n    and as Grote (\"H. G.\" x. 185, note 3) observes, the words may\r\n    \"include not simply the time which Timotheus took in actually\r\n    circumnavigating Peloponnesos, but the year which he spent\r\n    afterwards in the Ionian sea, and the time which he occupied in\r\n    performing his exploits near Korkyra, Leukas, and the\r\n    neighbourhood generally.\" For the character and exploits of\r\n    Timotheus, son of Conon, see Isocr. \"Or.\" xv. \"On the Antidosis,\"\r\n    SS. 101-139; Jebb, \"Att. Or.\" ii. p. 140 foll.; Rehdantz, \"Vit.\r\n    Iphicr. Chabr. Timoth. Atheniensium.\"\r\n\r\n (38) Or, \"the cities round about their territory,\" lit. \"the perioecid\r\n    cities.\" For the import of the epithet, see V. iv. 46; Freeman,\r\n    op. cit. iv. 173, note 1, in reference to Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 183,\r\n    note 4. For the battle of Tegyra see Grote, ib. 182; Plut.\r\n    \"Pelop.\" 17; Diod. xv. 57 (\"evidently this battle,\" Grote);\r\n    Callisthenes, fr. 3, ed. Did. Cf. Steph. Byz., {Tegura}.\r\n\r\nTimotheus in his cruise reached Corcyra, and reduced it at a blow. That\r\ndone, he neither enslaved the inhabitants nor drove them into exile,\r\nnor changed their laws. And of this conduct he reaped the benefit of\r\nthe increased cordiality (39) of all the cities of those parts. The\r\nLacedaemonians thereupon fitted out and despatched a counter fleet, with\r\nNicolochus in command, an officer of consummate boldness. This admiral\r\nno sooner caught sight of Timotheus's fleet than without hesitation, and\r\nin spite of the absence of six Ambraciot vessels which formed part\r\nof his squadron, he gave battle, with fifty-five ships to the enemy's\r\nsixty. The result was a defeat at the moment, and Timotheus set up a\r\ntrophy at Alyzia. But as soon as the six missing Ambraciot vessels\r\nhad reinforced him--the ships of Timotheus meanwhile being docked and\r\nundergoing repairs--he bore down upon Alyzia in search of the Athenian,\r\nand as Timotheus refused to put out to meet him, the Lacedaemonian in\r\nturn set up a trophy on the nearest group of islands.\r\n\r\n (39) The Corcyraeans, Acarnanians, and Cephallenians join the alliance\r\n    B.C. 375; see Hicks, 83. \"This decree dates from the autumn of\r\n    B.C. 375, immediately after Timotheos's visit to Korkyra (Xen.\r\n    'Hell.' V. iv. 64). The result was that the names of Korkyra,\r\n    Kephallenia, and Akarnania were inscribed upon the list (No. 81),\r\n    and an alliance was made with them.\" (See \"C. I. A.\" ii. p. 399\r\n    foll.; Hicks, loc. cit.; \"Hell.\" VI. v. 23); \"C. I. A.\" ii. 14.\r\n    The tablet is in the Asclepeian collection at the entrance of the\r\n    Acropolis at Athens. See Milchofer, \"Die Museum Athens,\" 1881, p.\r\n    45.\r\n\r\nB.C. 374. Timotheus, after repairing his original squadron and manning\r\nmore vessels from Corcyra, found himself at the head of more than\r\nseventy ships. His naval superiority was undisputed, but he was forced\r\nto send to Athens for moneys, seeing his fleet was large and his wants\r\nnot trifling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nB.C. 374. The Athenians and Lacedaemonians were thus engaged. But to\r\nreturn to the Thebans. After the subjugation of the cities in Boeotia,\r\nthey extended the area of aggression and marched into Phocis. The\r\nPhocians, on their side, sent an embassy to Lacedaemon, and pleaded that\r\nwithout assistance from that power they must inevitably yield to Thebes.\r\nThe Lacedaemonians in response conveyed by sea into the territory of\r\nPhocis their king Cleombrotus, at the head of four regiments and the\r\ncontingents of the allies.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Polydamus of Pharsalus arrived from Thessaly to\r\naddress the general assembly (1) of Lacedaemon. He was a man of high\r\nrepute throughout the whole of Thessaly, while in his native city he was\r\nregarded as so true a gentleman that the faction-ridden Pharsalians\r\nwere content to entrust the citadel to his keeping, and to allow their\r\nrevenues to pass through his hands. It was his privilege to disburse the\r\nmoney needed for sacred rites or other expenditure, within the limits\r\nof their written law and constitution. Out of these moneys this faithful\r\nsteward of the state was able to garrison and guard in safety for\r\nthe citizens their capital. Every year he rendered an account of his\r\nadministration in general. If there was a deficit he made it up out of\r\nhis own pocket, and when the revenues expanded he paid himself back. For\r\nthe rest, his hospitality to foreigners and his magnificence were on a\r\ntrue Thessalian scale. Such was the style and character of the man who\r\nnow arrived in Lacedaemon and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n (1) {pros to koinon}, \"h.e. vel ad ad senatum vel ad ephoros vel ad\r\n    concionem.\"--Sturz, \"Lex. Xen.\" s.v.\r\n\r\n\"Men of Lacedaemon, it is in my capacity as 'proxenos' and 'benefactor'\r\n(titles borne by my ancestry from time immemorial) that I claim, or\r\nrather am bound, in case of any difficulty to come to you, and, in case\r\nof any complication dangerous to your interests in Thessaly, to give you\r\nwarning. The name of Jason, I feel sure, is not unknown to Lacedaemonian\r\nears. His power as a prince is sufficiently large, and his fame\r\nwidespread. It is of Jason I have to speak. Under cover of a treaty of\r\npeace he has lately conferred with me, and this is the substance of what\r\nhe urged: 'Polydamas,' he said, 'if I chose I could lay your city at my\r\nfeet, even against its will, as the following considerations will prove\r\nto you. See,' he went on, 'the majority and the most important of the\r\nstates of Thessaly are my allies. I subdued them in campaigns in which\r\nyou took their side in opposition to myself. Again, you do not need\r\nto be told that I have six thousand mercenaries who are a match in\r\nthemselves, I take it, for any single state. It is not the mere numbers\r\non which I insist. No doubt as large an army could be raised in other\r\nquarters; but these citizen armies have this defect--they include men\r\nwho are already advanced in years, with others whose beards are scarcely\r\ngrown. Again, it is only a fraction of the citizens who attend to bodily\r\ntraining in a state, whereas with me no one takes mercenary service who\r\nis not as capable of endurance as myself.'\r\n\r\n\"And here, Lacedaemonians, I must tell you what is the bare truth. This\r\nJason is a man stout of limb and robust of body, with an insatiable\r\nappetite for toil. Equally true is it that he tests the mettle of those\r\nwith him day by day. He is always at their head, whether on a field-day\r\nunder arms, or in the gymnasium, or on some military expedition. The\r\nweak members of the corps he weeds out, but those whom he sees bear\r\nthemselves stout-heartedly in the face of war, like true lovers of\r\ndanger and of toil, he honours with double, treble, and quadruple\r\npay, or with other gifts. On the bed of sickness they will not lack\r\nattendance, nor honour in their graves. Thus every foreigner in his\r\nservice knows that his valour in war may obtain for him a livelihood--a\r\nlife replete at once with honour and abundance. (2)\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"a life satisfying at once to soul and body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then with some parade he pointed out to me what I knew before, that\r\nthe Maracians, and the Dolopians, and Alcetas the hyparch (3) in\r\nEpirus, were already subject to his sway; 'so that I may fairly ask you,\r\nPolydamas,' he proceeded, 'what I have to apprehend that I should not\r\nlook on your future subjugation as mere child's play. Perhaps some one\r\nwho did not know me, and what manner of man I am, might put it to me:\r\n\"Well! Jason, if all you say be true, why do you hesitate? why do you\r\nnot march at once against Pharsalia?\" For the good reason, I reply, that\r\nit suits me better to win you voluntarily than to annex you against your\r\nwills. Since, if you are forced, you will always be planning all the\r\nmischief you can against me, and I on my side shall be striving\r\nto diminish your power; whereas if you throw in your lot with mine\r\ntrustfully and willingly, it is certain we shall do what we can to help\r\neach other. I see and know, Polydamas, that your country fixes her eyes\r\non one man only, and that is yourself: what I guarantee you, therefore,\r\nis that, if you will dispose her lovingly to myself, I on my side will\r\nraise you up to be the greatest man in Hellas next to me. Listen, while\r\nI tell you what it is in which I offer you the second prize. Listen,\r\nand accept nothing which does not approve itself as true to your own\r\nreasoning. First, is it not plain to us both, that with the adhesion\r\nof Pharsalus and the swarm of pettier states dependent on yourselves,\r\nI shall with infinite ease become Tagos (4) of all the Thessalians; and\r\nthen the corollary--Thessaly so united--sixteen thousand cavalry and\r\nmore than ten thousand heavy infantry leap into life. Indeed, when I\r\ncontemplate the physique and proud carriage of these men, I cannot but\r\npersuade myself that, with proper handling, there is not a nation or\r\ntribe of men to which Thessalians would deign to yield submission. Look\r\nat the broad expanse of Thessaly and consider: when once a Tagos is\r\nestablished here, all the tribes in a circle round will lie stilled in\r\nsubjection; and almost every member of each of these tribes is an archer\r\nborn, so that in the light infantry division of the service our power\r\nmust needs excel. Furthermore, the Boeotians and all the rest of the\r\nworld in arms against Lacedaemon are my allies; they clamour to follow\r\nmy banner, if only I will free them from Sparta's yoke. So again the\r\nAthenians, I make sure, will do all they can to gain our alliance; but\r\nwith them I do not think we will make friends, for my persuasion is that\r\nempire by sea will be even easier to acquire than empire by land; and\r\nto show you the justice of this reasoning I would have you weigh the\r\nfollowing considerations. With Macedonia, which is the timber-yard (5)\r\nof the Athenian navy, in our hands we shall be able to construct a far\r\nlarger fleet than theirs. That stands to reason. And as to men, which\r\nwill be the better able to man vessels, think you--Athens, or ourselves\r\nwith our stalwart and numerous Penestae? (6) Which will better support\r\nmariners--a nation which, like our own, out of her abundance exports her\r\ncorn to foreign parts, or Athens, which, but for foreign purchases, has\r\nnot enough to support herself? And so as to wealth in general it is\r\nonly natural, is it not, that we, who do not look to a string of little\r\nislands for supplies, but gather the fruits of continental peoples,\r\nshould find our resources more copious? As soon as the scattered powers\r\nof Thessaly are gathered into a principality, all the tribes around, I\r\nrepeat, will become our tributaries. I need not tell you that the king\r\nof Persia reaps the fruits, not of islands, but of a continent, and he\r\nis the wealthiest of men! But the reduction of Persia will be still more\r\npracticable, I imagine, than that of Hellas, for there the men, save\r\none, are better versed in slavery than in prowess. Nor have I forgotten,\r\nduring the advance of Cyrus, and afterwards under Agesilaus, how scant\r\nthe force was before which the Persian quailed.'\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"his underlord in Epirus.\" By hyparch, I suppose, is implied\r\n    that Alcetas regarded Jason as his suzerain. Diodorus (xv. 13, 36)\r\n    speaks of him as \"king\" of the Molossians.\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"Prince,\" and below, \"Thessaly so converted into a\r\n    Principality.\" \"The Tagos of Thessaly was not a King, because his\r\n    office was not hereditary or even permanent; neither was he\r\n    exactly a Tyrant, because his office had some sort of legal\r\n    sanction. But he came much nearer to the character either of a\r\n    King or of a Tyrant than to that of a Federal President like the\r\n    General of the Achaians.... Jason of Pherai acts throughout\r\n    like a King, and his will seems at least as uncontrolled as that\r\n    of his brother sovereign beyond the Kambunian hills. Even Jason\r\n    seems to have been looked upon as a Tyrant (see below, 'Hell.' VI.\r\n    iv. 32); possibly, like the Athenian Demos, he himself did not\r\n    refuse the name\" (cf. Arist. \"Pol.\" iii. 4, 9).--Freeman, \"Hist.\r\n    Fed.

In answer\r\nI told him that what he urged was well worth weighing, but that we, the\r\nfriends of Lacedaemon, should so, without a quarrel, desert her and rush\r\ninto the arms of her opponents, seemed to me sheer madness. Whereat he\r\npraised me, and said that now must he needs cling all the closer to me\r\nif that were my disposition, and so charged me to come to you and\r\ntell you the plain truth, which is, that he is minded to march against\r\nPharsalus if we will not hearken to him. Accordingly he bade me demand\r\nassistance from you; 'and if they suffer you,' (7) he added, 'so to work\r\nupon them that they will send you a force sufficient to do battle with\r\nme, it is well: we will abide by war's arbitrament, nor quarrel with\r\nthe consequence; but if in your eyes that aid is insufficient, look to\r\nyourself. How shall you longer be held blameless before that fatherland\r\nwhich honours you and in which you fare so well?'

I have told you the whole story; it is based partly on what\r\nI see to be the case, and partly on what I have heard from yonder man.\r\nMy firm belief is, men of Lacedaemon, that if you are likely to despatch\r\na force sufficient, not in my eyes only, but in the eyes of all the rest\r\nof Thessaly, to cope with Jason in war, the states will revolt from\r\nhim, for they are all in alarm as to the future development of the man's\r\npower; but if you think a company of newly-enfranchised slaves and any\r\namateur general will suffice, I advise you to rest in peace. You may\r\ntake my word for it, you will have a great power to contend against, and\r\na man who is so prudent a general that, in all he essays to do, be it an\r\naffair of secrecy, or speed, or force, he is wont to hit the mark of his\r\nendeavours: one who is skilled, should occasion serve, to make the night\r\nof equal service to him with the day; (9) or, if speed be needful,\r\nwill labour on while breakfasting or taking an evening meal. And as for\r\nrepose, he thinks that the time for it has come when the goal is reached\r\nor the business on hand accomplished. And to this same practice he\r\nhas habituated those about him. Right well he knows how to reward the\r\nexpectations of his soldiers, when by the extra toil which makes the\r\ndifference they have achieved success; so that in his school all have\r\nlaid to heart that maxim, 'Pain first and pleasure after.' (10) And\r\nin regard to pleasure of the senses, of all men I know, he is the most\r\ncontinent; so that these also are powerless to make him idle at the\r\nexpense of duty. You must consider the matter then and tell me, as\r\nbefits you, what you can and will do.\"\r\n\r\n (9) See \"Cyrop.\" III. i. 19.\r\n\r\n (10) For this sentiment, see \"Mem.\" II. i. 20 et passim.\r\n\r\nSuch were the representations of Polydamas. The Lacedaemonians, for the\r\ntime being, deferred their answer; but after calculating the next\r\nday and the day following how many divisions (11) they had on foreign\r\nservice, and how many ships on the coast of Laconia to deal with the\r\nforeign squadron of the Athenians, and taking also into account the war\r\nwith their neighbours, they gave their answer to Polydamas: \"For the\r\npresent they would not be able to send him sufficient aid: under the\r\ncircumstances they advised him to go back and make the best settlement\r\nhe could of his own affairs and those of his city.\" He, thanking the\r\nLacedaemonians for their straightforwardness, withdrew.\r\n\r\n (11) Lit. \"morai.\"\r\n\r\nThe citadel of Pharsalus he begged Jason not to force him to give up:\r\nhis desire was to preserve it for those who had entrusted it to his safe\r\nkeeping; his own sons Jason was free to take as hostages, and he would\r\ndo his best to procure for him the voluntary adhesion of his city by\r\npersuasion, and in every way to further his appointment as Tagos of\r\nThessaly. Accordingly, after interchange of solemn assurances between\r\nthe pair, the Pharsalians were let alone and in peace, and ere long\r\nJason was, by general consent, appointed Tagos of all the Thessalians.\r\nOnce fairly vested with that authority, he drew up a list of the cavalry\r\nand heavy infantry which the several states were capable of furnishing\r\nas their quota, with the result that his cavalry, inclusive of allies,\r\nnumbered more than eight thousand, while his infantry force was computed\r\nat not less than twenty thousand; and his light troops would have been a\r\nmatch for those of the whole world--the mere enumeration of their cities\r\nwould be a labour in itself. (12) His next act was a summons to all the\r\ndwellers round (13) to pay tribute exactly the amount imposed in the\r\ndays of Scopas. (14) And here in this state of accomplishment we may\r\nleave these matters. I return to the point reached when this digression\r\ninto the affairs of Jason began.\r\n\r\n (12) See \"Cyrop.\" I. i. 5.\r\n\r\n (13) Lit. perioeci.\r\n\r\n (14) It is conjectured that the Scopadae ruled at Pherae and Cranusa\r\n    in the earlier half of the fifth century B.C.; see, for the change\r\n    of dynasty, what is said of Lycophron of Pherae in \"Hell.\" II.\r\n    iii. 4. There was a famous Scopas, son of Creon, to whom Simonides\r\n    addressed his poem--\r\n\r\n{Andr' agathon men alatheos genesthai khalepon khersin te kai posi kai\r\nnoo tetragonon, aneu psogou tetugmenon.}\r\n\r\na sentiment criticised by Plato, \"Protag.\" 359 A. \"Now Simonides says to\r\nScopas, the son of Creon, the Thessalian:\r\n\r\n'Hardly on the one hand can a man become truly good; built four-square\r\nin hands and feet and mind, a work without a flaw.'\r\n\r\nDo you know the poem?\"--Jowett, \"Plat.\" i. 153. But whether this Scopas\r\nis the Scopas of our text and a hero of Jason's is not clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nB.C. 374. The Lacedaemonians and their allies were collecting in\r\nPhocia, and the Thebans, after retreating into their own territory,\r\nwere guarding the approaches. At this juncture the Athenians, seeing the\r\nThebans growing strong at their expense without contributing a single\r\npenny to the maintenance of the fleet, while they themselves, what\r\nwith money contributions, and piratical attacks from Aegina, and the\r\ngarrisoning of their territory, were being pared to the bone, conceived\r\na desire to cease from war. In this mood they sent an embassy to\r\nLacedaemon and concluded peace. (1)\r\n\r\n (1) See Curtius, \"H. G.\" vol. iv. p. 376 (Eng. trans.)\r\n\r\nB.C. 374-373. This done, two of the ambassadors, in obedience to a\r\ndecree of the state, set sail at once from Laconian territory, bearing\r\norders to Timotheus to sail home, since peace was established. That\r\nofficer, while obeying his orders, availed himself of the homeward\r\nvoyage to land certain Zacynthian exiles (2) on their native soil,\r\nwhereupon the Zacynthian city party sent to Lacedaemon and complained of\r\nthe treatment they had received from Timotheus; and the Lacedaemonians,\r\nwithout further consideration, decided that the Athenians were in the\r\nwrong, and proceeded to equip another navy, and at length collected from\r\nLaconia itself, from Corinth, Leucas, (3) Ambracia, Elis, Zacynthus,\r\nAchaia, Epidaurus, Troezen, Hermione, and Halieis, a force amounting\r\nto sixty sail. In command of this squadron they appointed Mnasippus\r\nadmiral, with orders to attack Corcyra, and in general to look after\r\ntheir interests in those seas. They, moreover, sent an embassy to\r\nDionysius, instructing him that his interests would be advanced by the\r\nwithdrawal of Corcyra from Athenian hands.\r\n\r\n (2) See Hicks, 81, p. 142.\r\n\r\n (3) Ibid. 81, 86.\r\n\r\nB.C. 373. Accordingly Mnasippus set sail, as soon as his squadron was\r\nready, direct to Corcyra; he took with him, besides his troops from\r\nLacedaemon, a body of mercenaries, making a total in all of no less\r\nthan fifteen hundred men. His disembarked, and soon became master of the\r\nisland, the country district falling a prey to the spoiler. It was in\r\na high state of cultivation, and rich with fruit-trees, not to speak of\r\nmagnificent dwelling-houses and wine-cellars fitted up on the farms: so\r\nthat, it was said, the soldiers reached such a pitch of luxury that they\r\nrefused to drink wine which had not a fine bouquet. A crowd of slaves,\r\ntoo, and fat beasts were captured on the estates.\r\n\r\nThe general's next move was to encamp with his land forces about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile (4) from the city district, so that any\r\nCorcyraean who attempted to leave the city to go into the country would\r\ncertainly be cut off on that side. The fleet he stationed on the other\r\nside of the city, at a point where he calculated on detecting and\r\npreventing the approach of convoys. Besides which he established a\r\nblockade in front of the harbour when the weather permitted. In this way\r\nthe city was completely invested.\r\n\r\n (4) Lit. \"five stades.\"\r\n\r\nThe Corcyraeans, on their side, were in the sorest straits. They could\r\nget nothing from their soil owing to the vice in which they were gripped\r\nby land, whilst owing to the predominance of the enemy at sea nothing\r\ncould be imported. Accordingly they sent to the Athenians and begged for\r\ntheir assistance. They urged upon them that it would be a great mistake\r\nif they suffered themselves to be robbed of Corcyra. If they did so,\r\nthey would not only throw away a great advantage to themselves, but add\r\na considerable strength to their enemy; since, with the exception of\r\nAthens, no state was capable of furnishing a larger fleet or revenue.\r\nMoreover, Corcyra lay favourably (5) for commanding the Corinthian gulf\r\nand the cities which line its shores; it was splendidly situated for\r\ninjuring the rural districts of Laconia, and still more splendidly in\r\nrelation to the opposite shores of the continent of Epirus, and the\r\npassage between Peloponnesus and Sicily.\r\n\r\n (5) See Thuc. i. 36.\r\n\r\nThis appeal did not fall on deaf ears. The Athenians were persuaded\r\nthat the matter demanded their most serious attention, and they at once\r\ndespatched Stesicles as general, (6) with about six hundred peltasts.\r\nThey also requested Alcetas to help them in getting their troops across.\r\nThus under cover of night the whole body were conveyed across to a point\r\nin the open country, and found their way into the city. Nor was that\r\nall. The Athenians passed a decree to man sixty ships of war, and\r\nelected (7) Timotheus admiral. The latter, being unable to man the fleet\r\non the spot, set sail on a cruise to the islands and tried to make up\r\nthe complements of his crews from those quarters. He evidently looked\r\nupon it as no light matter to sail round Peloponnesus as if on a voyage\r\nof pleasure, and to attack a fleet in the perfection of training. (8) To\r\nthe Athenians, however, it seemed that he was wasting the precious time\r\nseasonable for the coastal voyage, and they were not disposed to condone\r\nsuch an error, but deposed him, appointing Iphicrates in his stead.\r\nThe new general was no sooner appointed than he set about getting\r\nhis vessels manned with the utmost activity, putting pressure on the\r\ntrierarchs. He further procured from the Athenians for his use not\r\nonly any vessels cruising on the coast of Attica, but the Paralus and\r\nSalaminia (9) also, remarking that, if things turned out well yonder,\r\nhe would soon send them back plenty of ships. Thus his numbers grew to\r\nsomething like seventy sail.\r\n\r\n (6) The name of the general was Ctesicles, according to Diod. xv. 47.\r\n    Read {strategon} for {tagon}, with Breitenbach, Cobet, etc. For\r\n    Alcetas, see above, \"Hell.\" VI. i. 7.\r\n\r\n (7) I.e. by show of hands, {ekheirotonoun}.\r\n\r\n (8) See Jowett, note to Thuc. VIII. xcv. 2, ii. p. 525.\r\n\r\n (9) The two sacred galleys. See Thuc. iii. 33; Aristoph. \"Birds,\" 147\r\n    foll.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Corcyraeans were sore beset with famine: desertion became\r\nevery day more frequent, so much so that Mnasippus caused proclamation\r\nto be made by herald that all deserters would be sold there and then;\r\n(10) and when that had no effect in lessening the stream of runaways,\r\nhe ended by driving them back with the lash. Those within the walls,\r\nhowever, were not disposed to receive these miserable slaves within\r\nthe lines, and numbers died outside. Mnasippus, not blind to what was\r\nhappening, soon persuaded himself that he had as good as got the city\r\ninto his possession: and he began to try experiments on his mercenaries.\r\nSome of them he had already paid off; (11) others still in his service\r\nhad as much as two months' pay owing to them by the general, who, if\r\nreport spoke true, had no lack of money, since the majority of the\r\nstates, not caring for a campaign across the seas, sent him hard cash\r\ninstead of men. But now the beleaguered citizens, who could espy\r\nfrom their towers that the outposts were less carefully guarded than\r\nformerly, and the men scattered about the rural districts, made a\r\nsortie, capturing some and cutting down others. Mnasippus, perceiving\r\nthe attack, donned his armour, and, with all the heavy troops he had,\r\nrushed to the rescue, giving orders to the captains and brigadiers (12)\r\nto lead out the mercenaries. Some of the captains answered that it\r\nwas not so easy to command obedience when the necessaries of life were\r\nlacking; whereat the Spartan struck one man with his staff, and another\r\nwith the butt of his spear. Without spirit and full of resentment\r\nagainst their general, the men mustered--a condition very unfavourable\r\nto success in battle. Having drawn up the troops, the general in person\r\nrepulsed the division of the enemy which was opposite the gates, and\r\npursued them closely; but these, rallying close under their walls,\r\nturned right about, and from under cover of the tombs kept up a\r\ncontinuous discharge of darts and other missiles; other detachments,\r\ndashing out at other gates, meanwhile fell heavily on the flanks of the\r\nenemy. The Lacedaemonians, being drawn up eight deep, and thinking that\r\nthe wing of their phalanx was of inadequate strength, essayed to wheel\r\naround; but as soon as they began the movement the Corcyraeans attacked\r\nthem as if they were fleeing, and they were then unable to recover\r\nthemselves, (13) while the troops next in position abandoned themselves\r\nto flight. Mnasippus, unable to succour those who were being pressed\r\nowing to the attack of the enemy immediately in front, found himself\r\nleft from moment to moment with decreasing numbers. At last the\r\nCorcyraeans collected, and with one united effort made a final rush upon\r\nMnasippus and his men, whose numbers were now considerably reduced.\r\nAt the same instant the townsmen, (14) eagerly noticing the posture of\r\naffairs, rushed out to play their part. First Mnasippus was slain, and\r\nthen the pursuit became general; nor could the pursuers well have failed\r\nto capture the camp, barricade and all, had they not caught sight of\r\nthe mob of traffickers with a long array of attendants and slaves, and\r\nthinking that here was a prize indeed, desisted from further chase.\r\n\r\n (10) Or, \"he would knock them all down to the hammer.\"\r\n\r\n (11) Or, \"cut off from their pay.\"\r\n\r\n (12) Lit. \"lochagoi and taxiarchs.\"\r\n\r\n (13) Or, \"to retaliate\"; or, \"to complete the movement.\"\r\n\r\n (14) Reading, after Dindorf, {oi politai}, or, if with the MSS., {oi\r\n    oplitai}; translate \"the heavy-armed among the assailants saw\r\n    their advantage and pressed on.\"\r\n\r\nThe Corcyraeans were well content for the moment to set up a trophy\r\nand to give back the enemy's dead under a flag of truce; but the\r\nafter-consequences were even more important to them in the revival of\r\nstrength and spirits which were sunk in despondency. The rumour spread\r\nthat Iphicrates would soon be there--he was even at the doors; and in\r\nfact the Corcyraeans themselves were manning a fleet. So Hypermenes,\r\nwho was second in command to Mnasippus and the bearer of his despatches,\r\nmanned every vessel of the fleet as full as it would hold, and then\r\nsailing round to the entrenched camp, filled all the transports with\r\nprisoners and valuables and other stock, and sent them off. He himself,\r\nwith his marines and the survivors of his troops, kept watch over the\r\nentrenchments; but at last even this remnant in the excess of panic and\r\nconfusion got on board the men-of-war and sailed off, leaving behind\r\nthem vast quantities of corn and wine, with numerous prisoners and\r\ninvalided soldiers. The fact was, they were sorely afraid of being\r\ncaught by the Athenians in the island, and so they made safely off to\r\nLeucas.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Iphicrates had commenced his voyage of circumnavigation,\r\npartly voyaging and partly making every preparation for an engagement.\r\nHe at once left his large sails behind him, as the voyage was only to\r\nbe the prelude of a battle; his flying jibs, even if there was a good\r\nbreeze, were but little used, since by making his progress depend on\r\nsheer rowing, he hoped at once to improve the physique of his men and\r\nthe speed of his attack. Often when the squadron was about to put into\r\nshore for the purpose of breakfast or supper, he would seize the moment,\r\nand draw back the leading wing of the column from the land off the point\r\nin question; and then facing round again with the triremes posted well\r\nin line, prow for prow, at a given signal let loose the whole fleet in a\r\nstoutly contested race for the shore. Great was the triumph in being the\r\nfirst to take in water or whatever else they might need, or the first to\r\nbreakfast; just as it was a heavy penalty on the late-comers, not only\r\nto come short in all these objects of desire, but to have to put out\r\nto sea with the rest as soon as the signal was given; since the\r\nfirst-comers had altogether a quiet time of it, whilst the hindmost must\r\nget through the whole business in hot haste. So again, in the matter\r\nof outposts, if he chanced to be getting the morning meal on hostile\r\nterritory, pickets would be posted, as was right and proper, on the\r\nland; but, apart from these, he would raise his masts and keep look-out\r\nmen on the maintops. These commanded of course a far wider prospect from\r\ntheir lofty perches than the outposts on the level ground. So too, when\r\nhe dined or slept he had no fires burning in the camp at night, but\r\nonly a beacon kindled in front of the encampment to prevent any unseen\r\napproach; and frequently in fine weather he put out to sea immediately\r\nafter the evening meal, when, if the breeze favoured, they ran along and\r\ntook their rest simultaneously, or if they depended on oars he gave his\r\nmariners repose by turns. During the voyage in daytime he would at\r\none time signal to \"sail in column,\" and at another signal \"abreast in\r\nline.\" So that whilst they prosecuted the voyage they at the same time\r\nbecame (both as to theory and practice) well versed in all the details\r\nof an engagement before they reached the open sea--a sea, as they\r\nimagined, occupied by their foes. For the most part they breakfasted\r\nand dined on hostile territory; but as he confined himself to bare\r\nnecessaries he was always too quick for the enemy. Before the hostile\r\nreinforcement would come up he had finished his business and was out to\r\nsea again.\r\n\r\nAt the date of Mnasippus's death he chanced to be off Sphagiae in\r\nLaconian territory. Reaching Elis, and coasting past the mouth of the\r\nAlpheus, he came to moorings under Cape Ichthus, (15) as it is called.\r\nThe next day he put out from that port for Cephallenia, so drawing up\r\nhis line and conducting the voyage that he might be prepared in every\r\ndetail to engage if necessary. The tale about Mnasippus and his demise\r\nhad reached him, but he had not heard it from an eye-witness, and\r\nsuspected that it might have been invented to deceive him and throw him\r\noff his guard. He was therefore on the look-out. It was, in fact, only\r\non arrival in Cephallenia that he learned the news in an explicit form,\r\nand gave his troops rest.\r\n\r\n (15) Cape Fish, mod. Cape Katakolon, protecting harbour of Pyrgos in\r\n    Elis.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that all these details of practice and manouvring are\r\ncustomary in anticipation of a sea-fight, but what I single out for\r\npraise in the case before us is the skill with which the Athenian\r\nadmiral attained a twofold object. Bearing in mind that it was his duty\r\nto reach a certain point at which he expected to fight a naval battle\r\nwithout delay, it was a happy discovery on his part not to allow\r\ntactical skill, on the one hand, to be sacrificed to the pace of\r\nsailing, (16) nor, on the other, the need of training to interfere with\r\nthe date of arrival.\r\n\r\n (16) Lit. \"the voyage.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reducing the towns of Cephallenia, Iphicrates sailed to Corcyra.\r\nThere the first news he heard was that the triremes sent by Dionysius\r\nwere expected to relieve the Lacedaemonians. On receipt of this\r\ninformation he set off in person and surveyed the country, in order\r\nto find a spot from which it would be possible to see the vessels\r\napproaching and to signal to the city. Here he stationed his look-out\r\nmen. A code of signals was agreed upon to signify \"vessels in sight,\"\r\n\"mooring,\" etc.; which done he gave his orders to twenty of his captains\r\nof men-of-war who were to follow him at a given word of command. Any one\r\nwho failed to follow him must not grumble at the penalty; that he warned\r\nthem. Presently the vessels were signalled approaching; the word of\r\ncommand was given, and then the enthusiasm was a sight to see--every\r\nman of the crews told off for the expedition racing to join his ship and\r\nembark. Sailing to the point where the enemy's vessels lay, he had no\r\ndifficulty in capturing the crews, who had disembarked from all the\r\nships with one exception. The exception was that of Melanippus the\r\nRhodian, who had advised the other captains not to stop at this point,\r\nand had then manned his own vessel and sailed off. Thus he encountered\r\nthe ships of Iphicrates, but contrived to slip through his fingers,\r\nwhile the whole of the Syracusan vessels were captured, crews and all.\r\n\r\nHaving cut the beaks off the prows, Iphicrates bore down into the\r\nharbour of Corcyra with the captured triremes in tow. With the captive\r\ncrews themselves he came to an agreement that each should pay a fixed\r\nsum as ransom, with one exception, that of Crinippus, their commander.\r\nHim he kept under guard, with the intention apparently of exacting a\r\nhandsome sum in his case or else of selling him. The prisoner, however,\r\nfrom vexation of spirit, put an end to his own life. The rest were sent\r\nabout their business by Iphicrates, who accepted the Corcyraeans as\r\nsureties for the money. His own sailors he supported for the most part\r\nas labourers on the lands of the Corcyraeans, while at the head of his\r\nlight infantry and the hoplites of the contingent he crossed over into\r\nAcarnania, and there lent his aid to any friendly state that needed his\r\nservices; besides which he went to war with the Thyrians, (17) a sturdy\r\nrace of warriors in possession of a strong fortress.\r\n\r\n (17) Thyreum (or Thyrium), in Acarnania, a chief city at the time of\r\n    the Roman wars in Greece; and according to Polybius (xxxviii. 5),\r\n    a meeting-place of the League on one occasion. See \"Dict. Anct.\r\n    Geog.\" s.v.; Freeman, op. cit. iv. 148; cf. Paus. IV. xxvi. 3, in\r\n    reference to the Messenians and Naupactus; Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 212.\r\n\r\nB.C. 372. Having attached to his squadron the navy also of Corcyra,\r\nwith a fleet numbering now about ninety ships he set sail, in the first\r\ninstance to Cephallenia, where he exacted money--which was in some cases\r\nvoluntarily paid, in others forcibly extorted. In the next place\r\nhe began making preparations partly to harass the territory of the\r\nLacedaemonians, and partly to win over voluntarily the other states in\r\nthat quarter which were hostile to Athens; or in case of refusal to go\r\nto war with them.\r\n\r\nThe whole conduct of the campaign reflects, I think, the highest credit\r\non Iphicrates. If his strategy was admirable, so too was the instinct\r\nwhich led him to advise the association with himself of two such\r\ncolleagues as Callistratus and Chabrias--the former a popular orator\r\nbut no great friend of himself politically, (18) the other a man of\r\nhigh military reputation. Either he looked upon them as men of unusual\r\nsagacity, and wished to profit by their advice, in which case I\r\ncommend the good sense of the arrangement, or they were, in his belief,\r\nantagonists, in which case the determination to approve himself a\r\nconsummate general, neither indolent nor incautious, was bold, I admit,\r\nbut indicative of a laudable self-confidence. Here, however, we must\r\npart with Iphicrates and his achievements to return to Athens.\r\n\r\n (18) Reading with the MSS. {ou mala epitedeion onta}. See Grote, \"H.\r\n    G.\" x. 206. Boeckh (\"P.

Still, to go hand in hand with\r\nthem, to be a party to their proceedings, this they absolutely refused,\r\nnow that they saw them marching against time-honoured friends of the\r\ncity like the Phocians, and blotting out states whose loyalty in the\r\ngreat Persian war was conspicuous no less than their friendship to\r\nAthens. Accordingly the People passed a decree to make peace; but in the\r\nfirst instance they sent an embassy to Thebes, inviting that state to\r\njoin them if it pleased them on an embassy which they proposed to send\r\nto Lacedaemon to treat of peace. In the next place they despatched such\r\nan embassy on their own account. Among the commissioners appointed\r\nwere Callias the son of Hipponicus, Autocles the son of Strombichides,\r\nDemostratus the son of Aristophon, Aristocles, Cephisodotus, (2)\r\nMelanopus, and Lycaethus.\r\n\r\n (1) Plataea destroyed in B.C. 373.

He had obtained\r\nfurlough from Iphicrates on an undertaking either to send money for\r\nthe fleet or to arrange a peace. Hence his arrival in Athens and\r\ntransactions in behalf of peace. After being introduced to the assembly\r\n(4) of the Lacedaemonians and to the allies, Callias, (5) who was the\r\ndadouchos (or torch-holder) in the mysteries, made the first speech.\r\nHe was a man just as well pleased to praise himself as to hear himself\r\npraised by others. He opened the proceedings as follows:\r\n\r\n (3) The bracketed words read like an annotator's comment, or possibly\r\n    they are a note by the author.\r\n\r\n (4) See above, \"Hell.\" II. iv. 38.\r\n\r\n (5) See above, \"Hell.\" IV. v. 13; Cobet, \"Prosop. Xen.\" p. 67 foll.;\r\n    Xen. \"Symp.\"; Plat. \"Protag.\"; Andoc. \"de Myst.\" If this is one\r\n    and the same person he must have been an elderly man at this date,\r\n    371 B.C.\r\n\r\n\"Lacedaemonians, the duty of representing you as proxenos at Athens is\r\na privilege which I am not the first member of my family to enjoy; my\r\nfather's father held it as an heirloom of our family and handed it down\r\nas a heritage to his descendants. If you will permit me, I should like\r\nto show you the disposition of my fatherland towards yourselves. If in\r\ntimes of war she chooses us as her generals, so when her heart is set\r\nupon quiet she sends us out as her messengers of peace. I myself have\r\ntwice already (6) stood here to treat for conclusion of war, and on both\r\nembassies succeeded in arranging a mutually agreeable peace. Now for\r\nthe third time I am come, and I flatter myself that to-day again I shall\r\nobtain a reconciliation, and on grounds exceptionally just. My eyes bear\r\nwitness that our hearts are in accord; you and we alike are pained at\r\nthe effacement of Plataeae and Thespiae. Is it not then reasonable that\r\nout of agreement should spring concord rather than discord? It is never\r\nthe part, I take it, of wise men to raise the standard of war for the\r\nsake of petty differences; but where there is nothing but unanimity they\r\nmust be marvellous folk who refuse the bond of peace. But I go further.\r\nIt were just and right on our parts even to refuse to bear arms against\r\neach other; since, as the story runs, the first strangers to whom our\r\nforefather Triptolemus showed the unspeakable mystic rites of Demeter\r\nand Core, the mother and the maiden, were your ancestors;--I speak of\r\nHeracles, the first founder of your state, and of your two citizens, the\r\ngreat twin sons of Zeus--and to Peloponnesus first he gave as a gift the\r\nseed of Demeter's corn-fruits. How, then, can it be just or right either\r\nthat you should come and ravage the corn crops of those from whom you\r\ngot the sacred seed of corn, or that we should not desire that they to\r\nwhom the gift was given should share abundantly of this boon? But if, as\r\nit would seem, it is a fixed decree of heaven that war shall never cease\r\namong men, yet ought we--your people and our people--to be as slow as\r\npossible to begin it, and being in it, as swift as possible to bring it\r\nto an end.\"\r\n\r\n (6) B.C. 387 and 374; see Curtius, \"H. G.\" vol. iv. p. 376 (Eng. ed.)\r\n\r\nAfter him Autocles (7) spoke: he was of repute as a versatile lawyer and\r\norator, and addressed the meeting as follows: \"Lacedaemonians, I do not\r\nconceal from myself that what I am about to say is not calculated to\r\nplease you, but it seems to me that, if you wish the friendship which\r\nwe are cementing to last as long as possible, we are wise to show each\r\nother the underlying causes of our wars. Now, you are perpetually saying\r\nthat the states ought to be independent; but it is you yourselves\r\nwho most of all stand in the way of independence--your first and last\r\nstipulation with the allied states being that they should follow you\r\nwhithersoever you choose to lead; and yet what has this principle of\r\nfollow-my-leader got to do with independent action? (8) Again, you pick\r\nquarrels without consulting your allies, and lead them against those\r\nwhom you account enemies; so that in many cases, with all their vaunted\r\nindependence, they are forced to march against their greatest friends;\r\nand, what is still more opposed to independence than all else, you\r\nare for ever setting up here your decarchies and there your thirty\r\ncommissioners, and your chief aim in appointing these officers and\r\ngovernors seems to be, not that they should fulfil their office and\r\ngovern legally, but that they should be able to keep the cities under\r\ntheir heels by sheer force. So that it looks as if you delighted in\r\ndespotisms rather than free constitutions. Let us go back to the date\r\n(9) at which the Persian king enjoined the independence of the states.\r\nAt that time you made no secret of your conviction that the Thebans, if\r\nthey did not suffer each state to govern itself and to use the laws\r\nof its own choice, would be failing to act in the spirit of the king's\r\nrescript. But no sooner had you got hold of Cadmeia than you would not\r\nsuffer the Thebans themselves to be independent. Now, if the maintenance\r\nof friendship be an object, it is no use for people to claim justice\r\nfrom others while they themselves are doing all they can to prove the\r\nselfishness of their aims.\"\r\n\r\n (7) For the political views of Autocles, see Curtius, \"H. G.\" iv. 387,\r\n    v. 94 (Eng. tr.); see also Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 225.\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"what consistency is there between these precepts of yours and\r\n    political independence?\"\r\n\r\n (9) Sixteen years before--B.C. 387. See \"Pol. Lac.\" xiv. 5.\r\n\r\nThese remarks were received in absolute silence, yet in the hearts of\r\nthose who were annoyed with Lacedaemon they stirred pleasure. After\r\nAutocles spoke Callistratus: \"Trespasses, men of Lacedaemon, have been\r\ncommitted on both sides, yours and ours, I am free to confess; but still\r\nit is not my view that because a man has done wrong we can never again\r\nhave dealings with him. Experience tells me that no man can go very far\r\nwithout a slip, and it seems to me that sometimes the transgressor by\r\nreason of his transgression becomes more tractable, especially if he be\r\nchastened through the error he has committed, as has been the case with\r\nus. And so on your own case I see that ungenerous acts have sometimes\r\nreaped their own proper reward: blow has been met by counter-blow; and\r\nas a specimen I take the seizure of the Cadmeia in Thebes. To-day, at\r\nany rate, the very cities whose independence you strove for have, since\r\nyour unrighteous treatment of Thebes, fallen one and all of them again\r\ninto her power. (10) We are schooled now, both of us, to know that\r\ngrasping brings not gain. We are prepared, I hope, to be once more\r\nmoderate under the influence of a mutual friendship. Some, I know, in\r\ntheir desire to render our peace (11) abortive accuse us falsely, as\r\nthough we were come hither, not seeking friendship, but because we\r\ndread the arrival of some (12) Antalcidas with moneys from the king. But\r\nconsider, what arrant nonsense they talk! Was it not, pray, the great\r\nking who demanded that all the states in Hellas should be independent?\r\nand what have we Athenians, who are in full agreement with the king,\r\nboth in word and deed, to fear from him? Or is it conceivable that he\r\nprefers spending money in making others great to finding his favourite\r\nprojects realised without expense?\r\n\r\n (10) Reading, with Breitenbach and Hartman, {as} instead of {os\r\n    espoudasate k.t.l.}\r\n\r\n (11) Or, more lit. \"to avert the peace\" as an ill-omened thing.\r\n\r\n (12) Without inserting {tis}, as Hartman proposes (\"An. Xen.\" p. 387),\r\n    that, I think, is the sense. Antalcidas is the arch-diplomat--a\r\n    name to conjure with, like that of Bismarck in modern European\r\n    politics. But see Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 213, note 2.\r\n\r\n\"Well! what is it really that has brought us here? No especial need\r\nor difficulty in our affairs. That you may discover by a glance at our\r\nmaritime condition, or, if you prefer, at the present posture of our\r\naffairs on land. Well, then, how does the matter stand? It is obvious\r\nthat some of our allies please us no better than they please you; (13)\r\nand, possibly, in return for your former preservation of us, we may be\r\ncredited with a desire to point out to you the soundness of our policy.\r\n\r\n (13) See, for this corrupt passage, Otto Keller, op. cit. p. 219;\r\n    Hartman, op. cit. p. 387; and Breitenbach, n. ad loc. In the next\r\n    sentence I should like to adopt Hartman's emendation (ib.) {on\r\n    orthos egnote} for the MSS. {a orthos egnomen}, and translate \"we\r\n    may like to prove to you the soundness of your policy at the\r\n    time.\" For the \"preservation\" referred to, see below, VI. v. 35,\r\n    and above, II. ii. 20.\r\n\r\n\"But, to revert once more to the topic of expediency and common\r\ninterests. It is admitted, I presume, that, looking at the states\r\ncollectively, half support your views, half ours; and in every single\r\nstate one party is for Sparta and another for Athens. Suppose, then,\r\nwe were to shake hands, from what quarter can we reasonably anticipate\r\ndanger and trouble? To put the case in so many words, so long as you\r\nare our friends no one can vex us by land; no one, whilst we are your\r\nsupports, can injure you by sea. Wars like tempests gather and grow to a\r\nhead from time to time, and again they are dispelled. That we all know.\r\nSome future day, if not to-day, we shall crave, both of us, for peace.\r\nWhy, then, need we wait for that moment, holding on until we expire\r\nunder the multitude of our ills, rather than take time by the forelock\r\nand, before some irremediable mischief betide, make peace? I cannot\r\nadmire the man who, because he has entered the lists and has scored many\r\na victory and obtained to himself renown, is so eaten up with the spirit\r\nof rivalry that he must needs go on until he is beaten and all his\r\ntraining is made futile. Nor again do I praise the gambler who, if he\r\nmakes one good stroke of luck, insists on doubling the stakes. Such\r\nconduct in the majority of cases must end in absolute collapse. Let us\r\nlay the lesson of these to heart, and forbear to enter into any such\r\nlists as theirs for life or death; but, while we are yet in the heyday\r\nof our strength and fortune, shake hands in mutual amity. So assuredly\r\nshall we through you and you through us attain to an unprecedented\r\npinnacle of glory throughout Hellas.\"\r\n\r\nThe arguments of the speakers were approved, and the Lacedaemonians\r\npassed a resolution to accept peace on a threefold basis: the withdrawal\r\nof the governors from the cities, (14) the disbanding of armaments naval\r\nand military, and the guarantee of independence to the states. \"If any\r\nstate transgressed these stipulations, it lay at the option of any power\r\nwhatsoever to aid the states so injured, while, conversely, to bring\r\nsuch aid was not compulsory on any power against its will.\" On these\r\nterms the oaths were administered and accepted by the Lacedaemonians on\r\nbehalf of themselves and their allies, and by the Athenians and\r\ntheir allies separately state by state. The Thebans had entered their\r\nindividual name among the states which accepted the oaths, but their\r\nambassadors came the next day with instructions to alter the name of\r\nthe signatories, substituting for Thebans Boeotians. (15) But Agesilaus\r\nanswered to this demand that he would alter nothing of what they had in\r\nthe first instance sworn to and subscribed. If they did not wish to\r\nbe included in the treaty, he was willing to erase their name at their\r\nbidding. So it came to pass that the rest of the world made peace, the\r\nsole point of dispute being confined to the Thebans; and the Athenians\r\ncame to the conclusion that there was a fair prospect of the Thebans\r\nbeing now literally decimated. (16) As to the Thebans themselves, they\r\nretired from Sparta in utter despondency.\r\n\r\n (14) Grote (\"H. G.\" x. 236) thinks that Diod. xv. 38 ({exagogeis})\r\n    belongs to this time, not to the peace between Athens and Sparta\r\n    in 374 B.C.\r\n\r\n (15) See, for a clear explanation of the matter, Freeman, \"Hist. Red.\r\n    Gov.\" iv. p. 175, note 3, in reference to Grote, ib. x. 231 note,\r\n    and Paus. IX. xiii. 2; Plut. \"Ages.\" 28; Thirlwall, \"H. G.\" v. p\r\n    69 note.\r\n\r\n (16) Or, \"as the saying is, taken and tithed.\" See below, VI. v. 35,\r\n    and for the origin of the saying, Herod. vii. 132.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the peace the Athenians proceeded to withdraw their\r\ngarrisons from the different sates, and sent to recall Iphicrates with\r\nhis fleet; besides which they forced him to restore everything captured\r\nsubsequently to the late solemn undertaking at Lacedaemon. The\r\nLacedaemonians acted differently. Although they withdrew their governors\r\nand garrisons from the other states, in Phocis they did not do so. Here\r\nCleombrotus was quartered with his army, and had sent to ask directions\r\nfrom the home authorities. A speaker, Prothous, maintained that their\r\nbusiness was to disband the army in accordance with their oaths, and\r\nthen to send round invitations to the states to contribute what each\r\nfelt individually disposed, and lay such sum in the temple of Apollo;\r\nafter which, if any attempt to hinder the independence of the states on\r\nany side were manifested, it would be time enough then again to invite\r\nall who cared to protect the principle of autonomy to march against its\r\nopponents. \"In this way,\" he added, \"I think the goodwill of heaven\r\nwill be secured, and the states will suffer least annoyance.\" But the\r\nAssembly, on hearing these views, agreed that this man was talking\r\nnonsense. Puppets in the hands of fate! (1) An unseen power, it would\r\nseem, was already driving them onwards; so they sent instructions to\r\nCleombrotus not to disband the army, but to march straight against\r\nthe Thebans if they refused to recognise the autonomy of the states.\r\n(Cleombrotus, it is understood, had, on hearing the news of the\r\nestablishment of peace, sent to the ephorate to ask for guidance;\r\nand then they sent him the above instructions, bidding him under the\r\ncircumstances named to march upon Thebes. (2))\r\n\r\n (1) See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 237: \"The miso-Theban impulse now drove them\r\n    on with a fury which overcame all other thoughts... a\r\n    misguiding inspiration sent by the gods--like that of the Homeric\r\n    Ate.\"\r\n\r\n (2) This passage reads like an earlier version for which the above was\r\n    substituted by the author.\r\n\r\nThe Spartan king soon perceived that, so far from leaving the Boeotian\r\nstates their autonomy, the Thebans were not even preparing to disband\r\ntheir army, clearly in view of a general engagement; he therefore felt\r\njustified in marching his troops into Boeotia. The point of ingress\r\nwhich he adopted was not that which the Thebans anticipated from Phocis,\r\nand where they were keeping guard at a defile; but, marching through\r\nThisbae by a mountainous and unsuspected route, he arrived before\r\nCreusis, taking that fortress and capturing twelve Theban war-vessels\r\nbesides. After this achievement he advanced from the seaboard and\r\nencamped in Leuctra on Thespian territory. The Thebans encamped in\r\na rising ground immediately opposite at no great distance, and were\r\nsupported by no allies except the Boeotians.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the friends of Cleombrotus came to him and urged upon\r\nhim strong reasons for delivering battle. \"If you let the Thebans escape\r\nwithout a battle,\" they said, \"you will run great risks of suffering\r\nthe extreme penalty at the hands of the state. People will call to mind\r\nagainst you the time when you reached Cynoscephelae and did not ravage a\r\nsquare foot of Theban territory; and again, a subsequent expedition when\r\nyou were driven back foiled in your attempt to make an entry into the\r\nenemy's country--while Agesilaus on each occasion found his entry\r\nby Mount Cithaeron. If then you have any care for yourself, or any\r\nattachment to your fatherland, march you against the enemy.\" That was\r\nwhat his friends urged. As to his opponents, what they said was, \"Now\r\nour fine friend will show whether he really is so concerned on behalf of\r\nthe Thebans as he is said to be.\"\r\n\r\nCleombrotus, with these words ringing in his ears, felt driven (3) to\r\njoin battle. On their side the leaders of Thebes calculated that, if\r\nthey did not fight, their provincial cities (4) would hold aloof from\r\nthem and Thebes itself would be besieged; while, if the commonalty of\r\nThebes failed to get supplies, there was every prospect that the city\r\nitself would turn against them; and, seeing that many of them had\r\nalready tasted the bitterness of exile, they came to the conclusion that\r\nit was better for them to die on the field of battle than to renew that\r\nexperience. Besides this they were somewhat encouraged by the recital of\r\nan oracle which predicted that the Lacedaemonians would be defeated\r\non the spot where the monument of the maidens stood, who, as the story\r\ngoes, being violated by certain Lacedaemonians, had slain themselves.\r\n(5) This sepulchral monument the Thebans decked with ornaments before\r\nthe battle. Furthermore, tidings were brought them from the city that\r\nall the temples had opened of their own accord; and the priestesses\r\nasserted that the gods revealed victory. Again, from the Heracleion\r\nmen said that the arms had disappeared, as though Heracles himself had\r\nsallied forth to battle. It is true that another interpretation (6)\r\nof these marvels made them out to be one and all the artifices of the\r\nleaders of Thebes. However this may be, everything in the battle turned\r\nout adverse to the Lacedaemonians; while fortune herself lent aid to\r\nthe Thebans and crowned their efforts with success. Cleombrotus held his\r\nlast council \"whether to fight or not,\" after the morning meal. In the\r\nheat of noon a little goes a long way; and the people said that it took\r\na somewhat provocative effect on their spirits. (7)\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"was provoked.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Lit. \"perioecid.\" See Thuc. iv. 76, Arnold's note, and \"Hell.\" V.\r\n    iv. 46, 63.\r\n\r\n (5) See Diod. xv. 54; Paus. IX. xiii. 3; Plut. \"Pelop.\" xx.\r\n\r\n (6) Or, \"it is true that some people made out these marvels.\"\r\n\r\n (7) Or, \"they were somewhat excited by it.\"\r\n\r\nBoth sides were now arming, and there was the unmistakeable signs of\r\napproaching battle, when, as the first incident, there issued from the\r\nBoeotian lines a long train bent on departure--these were the furnishers\r\nof the market, a detachment of baggage bearers, and in general such\r\npeople as had no inclination to join in the fight. These were met on\r\ntheir retreat and attacked by the mercenary troops under Hiero, who got\r\nround them by a circular movement. (8) The mercenaries were supported by\r\nthe Phocian light infantry and some squadrons of Heracleot and Phliasian\r\ncavalry, who fell upon the retiring train and turned them back, pursuing\r\nthem and driving them into the camp of the Boeotians. The immediate\r\neffect was to make the Boeotian portion of the army more numerous and\r\ncloser packed than before. The next feature of the combat was that in\r\nconsequence of the flat space of plain (9) between the opposing armies,\r\nthe Lacedaemonians posted their cavalry in front of their squares\r\nof infantry, and the Thebans followed suit. Only there was this\r\ndifference--the Theban cavalry was in a high state of training and\r\nefficiency, owing to their war with the Orchomenians and again their war\r\nwith Thespiae, whilst the cavalry of the Lacedaemonians was at its worst\r\nat this period. (10) The horses were reared and kept by the wealthiest\r\nmembers of the state; but whenever the ban was called out, an appointed\r\ntrooper appeared who took the horse with any sort of arms which might\r\nbe presented to him, and set off on the expedition at a moment's notice.\r\nMoreover, these troopers were the least able-bodied of the men: raw\r\nrecruits set simply astride their horses, and devoid of soldierly\r\nambition. Such was the cavalry of either antagonist.\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"surrounded them.\"\r\n\r\n (9) See Rustow and Kochly, op. cit. p. 173.\r\n\r\n (10) See \"Hipparch.\" ix. 4; also \"Cyrop.\" VIII. viii.\r\n\r\nThe heavy infantry of the Lacedaemonians, it is said, advanced by\r\nsections three files abreast, (11) allowing a total depth to the whole\r\nline of not more than twelve. The Thebans were formed in close order of\r\nnot less than fifty shields deep, calculating that victory gained over\r\nthe king's division of the army implied the easy conquest of the rest.\r\n\r\n (11) It would appear that the \"enomoty\" (section) numbered thirty-six\r\n    files. See \"Pol. Lac.\" xi. 4; xiii. 4. For further details as to\r\n    the tactical order of the Thebans, see Diod. xv. 55; Plut.\r\n    \"Pelop.\" xxiii.\r\n\r\nCleombrotus had hardly begun to lead his division against the foe\r\nwhen, before in fact the troops with him were aware of his advance, the\r\ncavalry had already come into collision, and that of the Lacedaemonians\r\nwas speedily worsted. In their flight they became involved with their\r\nown heavy infantry; and to make matters worse, the Theban regiments were\r\nalready attacking vigorously. Still strong evidence exists for\r\nsupposing that Cleombrotus and his division were, in the first instance,\r\nvictorious in the battle, if we consider the fact that they could never\r\nhave picked him up and brought him back alive unless his vanguard had\r\nbeen masters of the situation for the moment.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Deinon the polemarch and Sphodrias, a member of the\r\nking's council, with his son Cleonymus, (12) had fallen, then it was\r\nthat the cavalry and the polemarch's adjutants, (13) as they are\r\ncalled, with the rest, under pressure of the mass against them, began\r\nretreating; and the left wing of the Lacedaemonians, seeing the right\r\nborne down in this way, also swerved. Still, in spite of the numbers\r\nslain, and broken as they were, as soon as they had crossed the trench\r\nwhich protected their camp in front, they grounded arms on the spot (14)\r\nwhence they had rushed to battle. This camp, it must be borne in mind,\r\ndid not lie at all on the level, but was pitched on a somewhat steep\r\nincline. At this juncture there were some of the Lacedaemonians who,\r\nlooking upon such a disaster as intolerable, maintained that they ought\r\nto prevent the enemy from erecting a trophy, and try to recover the\r\ndead not under a flag of truce but by another battle. The polemarchs,\r\nhowever, seeing that nearly a thousand men of the total Lacedaemonian\r\ntroops were slain; seeing also that of the seven hundred Spartans\r\nthemselves who were on the field something like four hundred lay dead;\r\n(15) aware, further, of the despondency which reigned among the allies,\r\nand the general disinclination on their parts to fight longer (a frame\r\nof mind not far removed in some instances from positive satisfaction at\r\nwhat had taken place)--under the circumstances, I say, the polemarchs\r\ncalled a council of the ablest representatives of the shattered army\r\n(16) and deliberated as to what should be done. Finally the unanimous\r\nopinion was to pick up the dead under a flag of truce, and they sent a\r\nherald to treat for terms. The Thebans after that set up a trophy and\r\ngave back the bodies under a truce.\r\n\r\n (12) See above, V. iv. 33.\r\n\r\n (13) {sumphoreis}. For the readings of this corrupt passage see Otto\r\n    Keller.\r\n\r\n (14) Or, \"in orderly way.\" See Curt. \"H. G.\" iv. 400.\r\n\r\n (15) See \"Ages.\" ii. 24.\r\n\r\n (16) {tous epikairiotatous}. See above, III. iii. 10; \"Cyrop.\" VII.\r\n    iv. 4; VIII. iv. 32, vi. 2.\r\n\r\nAfter these events, a messenger was despatched to Lacedaemon with news\r\nof the calamity. He reached his destination on the last day of the\r\ngymnopaediae, (17) just when the chorus of grown men had entered the\r\ntheatre. The ephors heard the mournful tidings not without grief and\r\npain, as needs they must, I take it; but for all that they did not\r\ndismiss the chorus, but allowed the contest to run out its natural\r\ncourse. What they did was to deliver the names of those who had fallen\r\nto their friends and families, with a word of warning to the women not\r\nto make any loud lamentations but to bear their sorrow in silence; and\r\nthe next day it was a striking spectacle to see those who had relations\r\namong the slain moving to and fro in public with bright and radiant\r\nlooks, whilst of those whose friends were reported to be living barely a\r\nman was to be seen, and these flitted by with lowered heads and scowling\r\nbrows, as if in humiliation.\r\n\r\n (17) The festival was celebrated annually about midsummer. See Herod.\r\n    vi. 67; Thuc. v. 82, and Arnold's note; Pollux. iv. 105; Athen.\r\n    xiv. 30, xv. 22; Muller, \"Dorians,\" ii. 389.\r\n\r\nAfter this the ephors proceeded to call out the ban, including the\r\nforty-years-service men of the two remaining regiments; (18) and they\r\nproceeded further to despatch the reserves of the same age belonging\r\nto the six regiments already on foreign service. Hitherto the Phocian\r\ncampaign had only drawn upon the thirty-five-years-service list. Besides\r\nthese they now ordered out on active service the troops retained at\r\nthe beginning of the campaign in attendance on the magistrates at the\r\ngovernment offices. Agesilaus being still disabled by his infirmity,\r\nthe city imposed the duty of command upon his son Archidamus. The new\r\ngeneral found eager co-operators in the men of Tegea. The friends of\r\nStasippus at this date were still living, (19) and they were stanch\r\nin their Lacedaemonian proclivities, and wielded considerable power in\r\ntheir state. Not less stoutly did the Mantineans from their villages\r\nunder their aristocratic form of government flock to the Spartan\r\nstandard. Besides Tegea and Mantinea, the Corinthians and Sicyonians,\r\nthe Phliasians and Achaeans were equally enthusiastic to joining the\r\ncampaign, whilst other states sent out soldiers. Then came the fitting\r\nout and manning of ships of war on the part of the Lacedaemonians\r\nthemselves and of the Corinthians, whilst the Sicyonians were requested\r\nto furnish a supply of vessels on board of which it was proposed to\r\ntransport the army across the gulf. And so, finally, Archidamus was able\r\nto offer the sacrifices usual at the moment of crossing the frontier.\r\nBut to return to Thebes.\r\n\r\n (18) I.e. every one up to fifty-eight years of age.\r\n\r\n (19) See below, VI. v. 9.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the battle the Thebans sent a messenger to Athens\r\nwearing a chaplet. Whilst insisting on the magnitude of the victory they\r\nat the same time called upon the Athenians to send them aid, for now the\r\nopportunity had come to wreak vengeance on the Lacedaemonians for all\r\nthe evil they had done to Athens. As it chanced, the senate of the\r\nAthenians was holding a session on the Acropolis. As soon as the\r\nnews was reported, the annoyance caused by its announcement was\r\nunmistakeable. They neither invited the herald to accept of hospitality\r\nnor sent back one word in reply to the request for assistance. And so\r\nthe herald turned his back on Athens and departed.\r\n\r\nBut there was Jason still to look to, and he was their ally. To him then\r\nthe Thebans sent, and earnestly besought his aid, their thoughts running\r\non the possible turn which events might take. Jason on his side at\r\nonce proceeded to man a fleet, with the apparent intention of sending\r\nassistance by sea, besides which he got together his foreign brigade\r\nand his own cavalry; and although the Phocians and he were implacable\r\nenemies, (20) he marched through their territory to Boeotia. Appearing\r\nlike a vision to many of the states before his approach was even\r\nannounced--at any rate before levies could be mustered from a dozen\r\ndifferent points--he had stolen a march upon them and was a long way\r\nahead, giving proof that expedition is sometimes a better tool to work\r\nwith than sheer force.\r\n\r\n (20) Or, \"though the Phocians maintained a war 'a outrance' with him.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived in Boeotia the Thebans urged upon him that now was the\r\nright moment to attack the Lacedaemonians: he with his foreign brigade\r\nfrom the upper ground, they face to face in front; but Jason dissuaded\r\nthem from their intention. He reminded them that after a noble\r\nachievement won it was not worth their while to play for so high a\r\nstake, involving a still greater achievement or else the loss of victory\r\nalready gained. \"Do you not see,\" he urged, \"that your success followed\r\nclose on the heels of necessity? You ought then to reflect that the\r\nLacedaemonians in their distress, with a choice between life and death,\r\nwill fight it out with reckless desperation. Providence, as it seems,\r\nofttimes delights to make the little ones great and the great ones\r\nsmall.\" (21)\r\n\r\n (21) Cf. \"Anab.\" III. ii. 10.\r\n\r\nBy such arguments he diverted the Thebans from the desperate adventure.\r\nBut for the Lacedaemonians also he had words of advice, insisting on the\r\ndifference between an army defeated and an army flushed with victory.\r\n\"If you are minded,\" he said, \"to forget this disaster, my advice to you\r\nis to take time to recover breath and recruit your energies. When you\r\nhave grown stronger then give battle to these unconquered veterans. (22)\r\nAt present,\" he continued, \"you know without my telling you that among\r\nyour own allies there are some who are already discussing terms of\r\nfriendship with your foes. My advice is this: by all means endeavour\r\nto obtain a truce. This,\" he added, \"is my own ambition: I want to save\r\nyou, on the ground of my father's friendship with yourselves, and\r\nas being myself your representative.\" (23) Such was the tenor of his\r\nspeech, but the secret of action was perhaps to be found in a desire\r\nto make these mutual antagonists put their dependence on himself\r\nalone. Whatever his motive, the Lacedaemonians took his advice, and\r\ncommissioned him to procure a truce.\r\n\r\n (22) Or, \"the invincibles.\"\r\n\r\n (23) Lit. \"your proxenos.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news arrived that the terms were arranged, the polemarchs\r\npassed an order round: the troops were to take their evening meal, get\r\ntheir kit together, and be ready to set off that night, so as to scale\r\nthe passes of Cithaeron by next morning. After supper, before the hour\r\nof sleep, the order to march was given, and with the generals at their\r\nhead the troops advanced as the shades of evening fell, along the road\r\nto Creusis, trusting rather to the chance of their escaping notice, than\r\nto the truce itself. It was weary marching in the dead of night, making\r\ntheir retreat in fear, and along a difficult road, until they fell in\r\nwith Archidamus's army of relief. At this point, then, Archidamus waited\r\ntill all the allies had arrived, and so led the whole of the united\r\narmies back to Corinth, from which point he dismissed the allies and led\r\nhis fellow-citizens home.\r\n\r\nJason took his departure from Boeotia through Phocis, where he captured\r\nthe suburbs of Hyampolis (24) and ravaged the country districts, putting\r\nmany to the sword. Content with this, he traversed the rest of Phocis\r\nwithout meddling or making. Arrived at Heraclea, (25) he knocked down\r\nthe fortress of the Heracleots, showing that he was not troubled by any\r\napprehension lest when the pass was thrown open somebody or other might\r\nmarch against his own power at some future date. Rather was he haunted\r\nby the notion that some one or other might one day seize Heraclea, which\r\ncommanded the pass, and bar his passage into Hellas--should Hellas ever\r\nbe his goal. (26) At the moment of his return to Thessaly he had reached\r\nthe zenith of his greatness. He was the lawfully constituted Prince (27)\r\nof Thessaly, and he had under him a large mercenary force of infantry\r\nand cavalry, and all in the highest perfection of training. For this\r\ntwofold reason he might claim the title great. But he was still greater\r\nas the head of a vast alliance. Those who were prepared to fight his\r\nbattles were numerous, and he might still count upon the help of many\r\nmore eager to do so; but I call Jason greatest among his contemporaries,\r\nbecause not one among them could afford to look down upon him.

The Pythian games were now approaching, and an order went\r\nround the cities from Jason to make preparation for the solemn sacrifice\r\nof oxen, sheep and goats, and swine. It was reported that although the\r\nrequisitions upon the several cities were moderate, the number of beeves\r\ndid not fall short of a thousand, while the rest of the sacrificial\r\nbeasts exceeded ten times that number. He issued a proclamation also\r\nto this effect: a golden wreath of victory should be given to whichever\r\ncity could produce the best-bred bull to head the procession in honour\r\nof the god. And lastly there was an order issued to all the Thessalians\r\nto be ready for a campaign at the date of the Pythian games. His\r\nintention, as people said, was to act as manager of the solemn assembly\r\nand games in person. What the thought was that passed through his mind\r\nwith reference to the sacred money, remains to this day uncertain;\r\nonly, a tale is rife to the effect that in answer to the inquiry of the\r\nDelphians, \"What ought we to do, if he takes any of the treasures of the\r\ngod?\" the god made answer, \"He would see to that himself.\" This great\r\nman, his brain teeming with vast designs of this high sort, came now\r\nto his end. He had ordered a military inspection. The cavalry of\r\nthe Pheraeans were to pass muster before him. He was already seated,\r\ndelivering answers to all petitioners, when seven striplings approached,\r\nquarrelling, as it seemed, about some matter. Suddenly by these seven\r\nthe Prince was despatched; his throat gashed, his body gored with\r\nwounds. Stoutly his guard rushed to the rescue with their long spears,\r\nand one of the seven, while still in the act of aiming a blow at Jason,\r\nwas thrust through with a lance and died; a second, in the act of\r\nmounting his horse, was caught, and dropped dead, the recipient of many\r\nwounds. The rest leaped on the horses which they had ready waiting\r\nand escaped. To whatever city of Hellas they came honours were almost\r\nuniversally accorded them. The whole incident proves clearly that the\r\nHellenes stood in much alarm of Jason. They looked upon him as a tyrant\r\nin embryo.\r\n\r\nSo Jason was dead; and his brothers Polydorus and Polyphron were\r\nappointed princes (29) in his place. But of these twain, as they\r\njourneyed together to Larissa, Polydorus was slain in the night, as\r\nhe slept, by his brother Polyphron, it was thought; since a death so\r\nsudden, without obvious cause, could hardly be otherwise accounted for.\r\n\r\n (29) Lit. \"Tagoi.\"\r\n\r\nPolyphron governed for a year, and by the year's end he had refashioned\r\nhis princedom into the likeness of a tyranny. In Pharsalus he put to\r\ndeath Polydamas (30) and eight other of the best citizens; and from\r\nLarissa he drove many into exile. But while he was thus employed, he,\r\nin his turn, was done to death by Alexander, who slew him to avenge\r\nPolydorus and to destroy the tyranny. This man now assumed the reins of\r\noffice, and had no sooner done so than he showed himself a harsh prince\r\nto the Thessalians: harsh too and hostile to the Thebans and Athenians,\r\n(31) and an unprincipled freebooter everywhere by land and by sea. But\r\nif that was his character, he too was doomed to perish shortly. The\r\nperpetrators of the deed were his wife's brothers. (32) The counsellor\r\nof it and the inspiring soul was the wife herself. She it was who\r\nreported to them that Alexander had designs against them; who hid them\r\nwithin the house a whole day; who welcomed home her husband deep in his\r\ncups and laid him to rest, and then while the lamp still burned brought\r\nout the prince's sword. It was she also who, perceiving her brothers\r\nshrank bank, fearing to go in and attack Alexander, said to them, \"If\r\nyou do not be quick and do the deed, I will wake him up!\" After they had\r\ngone in, she, too, it was who caught and pulled to the door, clinging\r\nfast to the knocker till the breath was out of her husband's body. (33)\r\nHer fierce hatred against the man is variously explained. By some it\r\nwas said to date from the day when Alexander, having imprisoned his own\r\nfavourite--who was a fair young stripling--when his wife supplicated\r\nhim to release the boy, brought him forth and stabbed him in the throat.\r\nOthers say it originated through his sending to Thebes and seeking the\r\nhand of the wife of Jason in marriage, because his own wife bore him no\r\nchildren. These are the various causes assigned to explain the treason\r\nof his wife against him. Of the brothers who executed it, the eldest,\r\nTisiphonus, in virtue of his seniority accepted, and up to the date of\r\nthis history (34) succeeded in holding, the government.\r\n\r\n (30) See above, VI. i. 2 foll.\r\n\r\n (31) See Dem. \"c.

See\r\n    {Kuprianos, Peri ton 'Ell}: p. 111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe above is a sketch of Thessalian affairs, including the incidents\r\nconnected with Jason, and those subsequent to his death, down to\r\nthe government of Tisiphonus. I now return to the point at which we\r\ndigressed.\r\n\r\nB.C. 371. Archidamus, after the relief of the army defeated at Leuctra,\r\nhad led back the united forces. When he was gone, the Athenians,\r\nimpressed by the fact that the Peloponessians still felt under an\r\nobligation to follow the Lacedaemonians to the field, whilst Sparta\r\nherself was by no means as yet reduced to a condition resembling that\r\nto which she had reduced Athens, sent invitations to those states which\r\ncared to participate in the peace authorised by the great king. (1) A\r\ncongress met, and they passed a resolution in conjunction with those\r\nwho wished to make common cause with them to bind themselves by oath\r\nas follows: \"I will abide by the treaty terms as conveyed in the king's\r\nrescript, as also by the decrees of the Athenians and the allies. If any\r\none marches against any city among those which have accepted this oath,\r\nI will render assistance to that city with all my strength.\" The oath\r\ngave general satisfaction, the Eleians alone gainsaying its terms and\r\nprotesting that it was not right to make either the Marganians or the\r\nScilluntians or the Triphylians independent, since these cities belonged\r\nto them, and were a part of Elis. (2) The Athenians, however, and the\r\nothers passed the decree in the precise language of the king's rescript:\r\nthat all states--great and small alike--were to be independent; and\r\nthey sent out administrators of the oath, and enjoined upon them to\r\nadminister it to the highest authorities in each state. This oath they\r\nall, with the exception of the Eleians, swore to.\r\n\r\n (1) I.e. in B.C. 387, the peace \"of\" Antalcidas. See Grote, \"H. G.\" x.\r\n    274.\r\n\r\n (2) See Busolt, op. cit. p. 186.\r\n\r\nB.C. 371-370. As an immediate consequence of this agreement, the\r\nMantineans, on the assumption that they were now absolutely independent,\r\nmet in a body and passed a decree to make Mantinea into a single state\r\nand to fortify the town. (3) The proceeding was not overlooked by the\r\nLacedaemonians, who thought it would be hard if this were done without\r\ntheir consent. Accordingly they despatched Agesilaus as ambassador to\r\nthe Mantineans, choosing him as the recognised ancestral friend of that\r\npeople. When the ambassador arrived, however, the chief magistrates had\r\nno inclination to summon a meeting of the commons to listen to him, but\r\nurged him to make a statement of his wishes to themselves. He, on his\r\nside, was ready to undertake for himself and in their interests that,\r\nif they would at present desist from their fortification work, he\r\nwould bring it about that the defensive walls should be built with the\r\nsanction of Lacedaemon and without cost. Their answer was, that it was\r\nimpossible to hold back, since a decree had been passed by the whole\r\nstate of Mantinea to build at once. Whereupon Agesilaus went off in high\r\ndudgeon; though as to sending troops to stop them, (4) the idea seemed\r\nimpracticable, as the peace was based upon the principle of autonomy.\r\nMeanwhile the Mantineans received help from several of the Arcadian\r\nstates in the building of their walls; and the Eleians contributed\r\nactually three talents (5) of silver to cover the expense of their\r\nconstruction. And here leaving the Mantineans thus engaged, we will turn\r\nto the men of Tegea.\r\n\r\n (3) For the restoration of Mantinea, see Freeman, \"Fed. Gov.\" iv. p.\r\n    198; Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 283 foll.\r\n\r\n (4) See above, V. ii. 1, sub anno B.C. 386.\r\n\r\n (5) = 731 pounds: 5 shillings. See Busolt, op. cit. p. 199.\r\n\r\nThere were in Tegea two political parties. The one was the party of\r\nCallibius and Proxenus, who were for drawing together the whole Arcadian\r\npopulation in a confederacy, (6) in which all measures carried in\r\nthe common assembly should be held valid for the individual component\r\nstates. The programme of the other (Stasippus's) party was to leave\r\nTegea undisturbed and in the enjoyment of the old national laws.\r\nPerpetually defeated in the Sacred College, (7) the party of Callibius\r\nand Proxenus were persuaded that if only the commons met they would gain\r\nan easy victory by an appeal to the multitude; and in this faith they\r\nproceeded to march out the citizen soldiers. (8) At sight of this\r\nStasippus and his friends on their side armed in opposition, and proved\r\nnot inferior in numbers. The result was a collision and battle, in which\r\nProxenus and some few others with him were slain and the rest put to\r\nflight; though the conquerors did not pursue, for Stasippus was a\r\nman who did not care to stain his hands with the blood of his\r\nfellow-citizens. (9)\r\n\r\n (6) Although the historian does not recount the foundation of\r\n    Megalopolis (see Pausanias and Diodorus), the mention of the\r\n    common assembly of the League {en to koino} in this passage and,\r\n    still more, of the Ten Thousand (below, \"Hell.\" VII. i. 38),\r\n    implies it. See Freeman, op. cit. iv. 197 foll.; Grote, \"H. G.\" x.\r\n    306 foll., ii. 599; \"Dict. of Geog.\" \"Megalopolis.\" As to the date\r\n    of its foundation Pausanias (VIII. xxvii. 8) says \"a few months\r\n    after the battle of Leuctra,\" before midsummer B.C. 370; Diodorus\r\n    (xv. 72) says B.C. 368. The great city was not built in a day.\r\n    Messene, according to Paus. IV. xxvii. 5, was founded between the\r\n    midsummers of B.C. 370 and B.C. 369.\r\n\r\n (7) Lit. \"in the Thearoi.\" For the Theari, see Thuc. v. 47, Arnold's\r\n    note; and \"C. I. G.\" 1756 foll.; and for the revolution at Tegea\r\n    here recounted, see Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 285 foll.\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"they mustered under arms.\"\r\n\r\n (9) Or, \"opposed to a wholesale slaughter of the citizens.\"\r\n\r\nCallibius and his friends had retired under the fortification walls and\r\ngates facing Mantinea; but, as their opponents made no further attempts\r\nagainst them, they here collected together and remained quiet. Some\r\nwhile ago they had sent messages to the Mantineans demanding assistance,\r\nbut now they were ready to discuss terms of reconciliation with the\r\nparty of Stasippus. Presently they saw the Mantineans advancing;\r\nwhereupon some of them sprang to the walls, and began calling to them to\r\nbring succour with all speed. With shouts they urged upon them to make\r\nhaste, whilst others threw open wide the gates to them. Stasippus\r\nand his party, perceiving what was happening, poured out by the gates\r\nleading to Pallantium, (10) and, outspeeding their pursuers, succeeded\r\nin reaching the temple of Artemis, where they found shelter, and,\r\nshutting to the doors, kept quiet. Following close upon their heels,\r\nhowever, their foes scaled the temple, tore off the roof, and began\r\nstriking them down with the tiles. They, recognising that there was no\r\nchoice, called upon their assailants to desist, and undertook to come\r\nforth. Then their opponents, capturing them like birds in a fowler's\r\nhand, bound them with chains, threw them on to the prisoner's van, (11)\r\nand led them off to Tegea. Here with the Mantineans they sentenced and\r\nput them to death.\r\n\r\n (10) Pallantium, one of the most ancient towns of Arcadia, in the\r\n    Maenalia (Paus. VIII. xliv. 5; Livy, i. 5), situated somewhat\r\n    south of the modern Tripolitza (see \"Dict. of Anc. Geog.\"); like\r\n    Asea and Eutaea it helped to found Megalopolis (Paus. VIII. xxvii.\r\n    3, where for {'Iasaia} read {'Asea}); below, VII. v. 5; Busolt,\r\n    op. cit. p. 125.\r\n\r\n (11) For the sequel of the matter, see above, \"Hell.\" VI. iv. 18;\r\n    Busolt, op. cit. p. 134.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of these proceedings was the banishment to Lacedaemon of the\r\nTegeans who formed the party of Stasippus, numbering eight hundred; but\r\nas a sequel to what had taken place, the Lacedaemonians determined that\r\nthey were bound by their oaths to aid the banished Tegeans and to avenge\r\nthe slain. With this purpose they marched against the Mantineans, on the\r\nground that they had violated their oaths in marching against Tegea with\r\nan armed force. The ephors called out the ban and the state commanded\r\nAgesilaus to head the expedition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile most of the Arcadian contingents were mustering at Asea. (12)\r\nThe Orchomenians not only refused to take part in the Arcadian league,\r\non account of their personal hatred to Mantinea, but had actually\r\nwelcomed within their city a mercenary force under Polytropus, which had\r\nbeen collected at Corinth. The Mantineans themselves were forced to\r\nstay at home to keep an eye on these. The men of Heraea and Lepreum made\r\ncommon cause with the Lacedaemonians in a campaign against Mantinea.\r\n\r\n (12) Asea is placed by Leake (\"Travels in Morea,\" i. 84; iii. 34) near\r\n    Frangovrysi, a little south of Pallantium.\r\n\r\n    Heraea, the most important town of Arcadia in the Cynuria, near\r\n    Elis, on the high road to Olympia, and commanding other main\r\n    roads. See Leake, \"Peloponnesiaca,\" p. 1 foll.; \"Morea,\" ii. 91.\r\n\r\n    Lepreum, chief town of the Triphylia (Herod. iv. 148, ix. 28;\r\n    Thuc. v. 31; above, III. ii. 25; Paus. V. v. 3; Polyb. iv. 77\r\n    foll.; Strab. viii. 345), near modern Strovitzi; Leake, \"Morea,\"\r\n    i. 56; Dodwell, \"Tour,\" ii. 347.\r\n\r\n    Eutaea is placed by Leake between Asea and Pallantium at Barbitza\r\n    (\"Morea,\" iii. 31); but see Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 288.\r\n\r\nFinding the frontier sacrifices favourable, Agesilaus began his march\r\nat once upon Arcadia. He began by occupying the border city of Eutaea,\r\nwhere he found the old men, women, and children dwelling in their\r\nhouses, while the rest of the population of a military age were off\r\nto join the Arcadian league. In spite of this he did not stir a finger\r\nunjustly against the city, but suffered the inhabitants to continue in\r\ntheir homes undisturbed. The troops took all they needed, and paid for\r\nit in return; if any pillage had occurred on his first entrance into\r\nthe town, the property was hunted up and restored by the Spartan king.\r\nWhilst awaiting the arrival of Polytropus's mercenaries, he amused\r\nhimself by repairing such portions of their walls as necessity demanded.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Mantineans had taken the field against Orchomenus;\r\nbut from the walls of that city the invaders had some difficulty in\r\nretiring, and lost some of their men. On their retreat they found\r\nthemselves in Elymia; (13) here the heavy infantry of the Orchomenians\r\nceased to follow them; but Polytropus and his troops continued to assail\r\ntheir rear with much audacity. At this conjuncture, seeing at a glance\r\nthat either they must beat back the foe or suffer their own men to be\r\nshot down, the Mantineans turned right about and met the assailant in\r\na hand-to-hand encounter. Polytropus fell fighting on that battlefield;\r\nand of the rest who took to flight, many would have shared his fate, but\r\nfor the opportune arrival of the Phliasian cavalry, who swooped round to\r\nthe conqueror's rear and checked him in his pursuit. (14)\r\n\r\n (13) Elymia, mentioned only by Xenophon, must have been on the\r\n    confines of the Mantinice and Orchomenus, probably at Levidhi.--\r\n    Leake, \"Morea,\" iii. 75; \"Peloponn.\" p. 229.\r\n\r\n (14) See \"Cyrop.\" VII. i. 36.\r\n\r\nContent with this achievement, the Mantineans retired homewards; while\r\nAgesilaus, to whom the news was brought, no longer expecting that the\r\nOrchomenian mercenaries could effect a junction with himself, determined\r\nto advance without further delay. (15) On the first day he encamped for\r\nthe evening meal in the open country of Tegea, and the day following\r\ncrossed into Mantinean territory. Here he encamped under the\r\nwestward-facing (16) mountains of Mantinea, and employed himself in\r\nravaging the country district and sacking the farmsteads; while the\r\ntroops of the Arcadians who were mustered in Asea stole by night into\r\nTegea. The next day Agesilaus shifted his position, encamping about\r\ntwo miles' (17) distance from Mantinea; and the Arcadians, issuing from\r\nTegea and clinging to the mountains between Mantinea and that city,\r\nappeared with large bodies of heavy infantry, wishing to effect a\r\njunction with the Mantineans. The Argives, it is true, supported them,\r\nbut they were not in full force. And here counsellors were to be found\r\nwho urged on Agesilaus to attack these troops separately; but fearing\r\nlest, in proportion as he pressed on to engage them, the Mantineans\r\nmight issue from the city behind and attack him on flank and rear, he\r\ndecided it was best to let the two bodies coalesce, and then, if they\r\nwould accept battle, to engage them on an open and fair field.\r\n\r\n (15) See \"Ages.\" ii. 23.\r\n\r\n (16) See Leake, \"Morea,\" iii. 73.\r\n\r\n (17) Lit. \"twenty stades.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so ere long the Arcadians had effected their object and were united\r\nwith the Mantineans. The next incident was the sudden apparition at\r\nbreak of day, as Agesilaus was sacrificing in front of the camp, of a\r\nbody of troops. These proved to be the light infantry from Orchomenus,\r\nwho in company with the Phliasian cavalry had during the night made\r\ntheir way across past the town of Mantinea; and so caused the mass of\r\nthe army to rush to their ranks, and Agesilaus himself to retire within\r\nthe lines. Presently, however, the newcomers were recognised as friends;\r\nand as the sacrifices were favourable, Agesilaus led his army forward\r\na stage farther after breakfast. As the shades of evening descended he\r\nencamped unobserved within the fold of the hills behind the Mantinean\r\nterritory, with mountains in close proximity all round. (18)\r\n\r\n (18) Lit. \"within the hindmost bosom of the Mantinice.\" In reference\r\n    to the position, Leake (\"Morea,\" iii. 75) says: \"The northern bay\r\n     (of the Mantinic plain between Mantinea and the Argon) corresponds\r\n    better by its proximity to Mantinea; by Mount Alesium it was\r\n    equally hidden from the city, while its small dimensions, and the\r\n    nearness of the incumbent mountains, rendered it a more hazardous\r\n    position to an army under the circumstances of that of Agesilaus\"\r\n     (than had he encamped in the Argon itself). For the Argon (or\r\n    Inert Plain), see Leake, ib. 54 foll.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning, as day broke, he sacrificed in front of the army;\r\nand observing a mustering of men from the city of Mantinea on the hills\r\nwhich overhung the rear of his army, he decided that he must lead his\r\ntroops out of the hollow by the quickest route. But he feared lest, if\r\nhe himself led off, the enemy might fall upon his rear. In this dilemma\r\nhe kept quiet; presenting a hostile front to the enemy, he sent orders\r\nto his rear to face about to the right, (19) and so getting into line\r\nbehind his main body, to move forward upon him; and in this way he\r\nat once extricated his troops from their cramped position and kept\r\ncontinually adding to the weight and solidity of his line. As soon as\r\nthe phalanx was doubled in depth he emerged upon the level ground, with\r\nhis heavy infantry battalions in this order, and then again extended his\r\nline until his troops were once more nine or ten shields deep. But the\r\nMantineans were no longer so ready to come out. The arguments of the\r\nEleians who had lent them their co-operation had prevailed: that it was\r\nbetter not to engage until the arrival of the Thebans. The Thebans,\r\nit was certain, would soon be with them; for had they not borrowed ten\r\ntalents (20) from Elis in order to be able to send aid? The Arcadians\r\nwith this information before them kept quiet inside Mantinea. On\r\nhis side Agesilaus was anxious to lead off his troops, seeing it was\r\nmidwinter; but, to avoid seeming to hurry his departure out of fear,\r\nhe preferred to remain three days longer and no great distance from\r\nMantinea. On the fourth day, after an early morning meal, the retreat\r\ncommenced. His intention was to encamp on the same ground which he had\r\nmade his starting-point on leaving Eutaea. But as none of the Arcadians\r\nappeared, he marched with all speed and reached Eutaea itself, although\r\nvery late, that day; being anxious to lead off his troops without\r\ncatching a glimpse of the enemy's watch-fires, so as to silence the\r\ntongues of any one pretending that he withdrew in flight. His main\r\nobject was in fact achieved. To some extent he had recovered the state\r\nfrom its late despondency, since he had invaded Arcadia and ravaged the\r\ncountry without any one caring to offer him battle. But, once arrived\r\non Laconian soil, he dismissed the Spartan troops to their homes and\r\ndisbanded the provincials (21) to their several cities.\r\n\r\n (19) See \"Anab.\" IV. iii. 29; \"Pol. Lac.\" xi. 10.\r\n\r\n (20) 2,437 pounds: 10 shillings. See Busult, op. cit. p. 199.\r\n\r\n (21) Lit. \"perioeci\"; and below, SS. 25, 32.\r\n\r\nB.C. 370-369. The Arcadians, now that Agesilaus had retired, realising\r\nthat he had disbanded his troops, while they themselves were fully\r\nmustered, marched upon Heraea, the citizens of which town had not only\r\nrefused to join the Arcadian league, but had joined the Lacedaemonians\r\nin their invasion of Arcadia. For this reason they entered the country,\r\nburning the homesteads and cutting down the fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile news came of the arrival of the Theban reinforcements at\r\nMantinea, on the strength of which they left Heraea and hastened to\r\nfraternise (22) with their Theban friends. When they were met together,\r\nthe Thebans, on their side, were well content with the posture of\r\naffairs: they had duly brought their succour, and no enemy was any\r\nlonger to be discovered in the country; so they made preparations to\r\nreturn home. But the Arcadians, Argives and Eleians were eager in\r\nurging them to lead the united forces forthwith into Laconia: they dwelt\r\nproudly on their own numbers, extolling above measure the armament of\r\nThebes. And, indeed, the Boeotians one and all were resolute in their\r\nmilitary manouvres and devotion to arms, (23) exulting in the victory of\r\nLeuctra. In the wake of Thebes followed the Phocians, who were now their\r\nsubjects, Euboeans from all the townships of the island, both sections\r\nof the Locrians, the Acarnanians, (24) and the men of Heraclea and of\r\nMelis; while their force was further swelled by Thessalian cavalry and\r\nlight infantry. With the full consciousness of facts like these, and\r\nfurther justifying their appeal by dwelling on the desolate condition of\r\nLacedaemon, deserted by her troops, they entreated them not to turn back\r\nwithout invading the territory of Laconia. But the Thebans, albeit they\r\nlistened to their prayers, urged arguments on the other side. In the\r\nfirst place, Laconia was by all accounts most difficult to invade;\r\nand their belief was that garrisons were posted at all the points most\r\neasily approached. (As a matter of fact, Ischolaus was posted at Oeum\r\nin the Sciritid, with a garrison of neodamodes and about four hundred\r\nof the youngest of the Tegean exiles; and there was a second outpost on\r\nLeuctrum above the Maleatid. (25)) Again it occurred to the Thebans\r\nthat the Lacedaemonian forces, though disbanded, would not take long to\r\nmuster, and once collected they would fight nowhere better than on their\r\nown native soil. Putting all these considerations together, they\r\nwere not by any means impatient to march upon Lacedaemon. A strong\r\ncounter-impulse, however, was presently given by the arrival of\r\nmessengers from Caryae, giving positive information as to the\r\ndefenceless condition of the country, and offering to act as guides\r\nthemselves; they were ready to lose their lives if they were convicted\r\nof perfidy. A further impulse in the same direction was given by the\r\npresence of some of the provincials, (26) with invitations and promises\r\nof revolt, if only they would appear in the country. These people\r\nfurther stated that even at the present moment, on a summons of the\r\nSpartans proper, the provincials did not care to render them assistance.\r\nWith all these arguments and persuasions echoing from all sides, the\r\nThebans at last yielded, and invaded. They chose the Caryan route\r\nthemselves, while the Arcadians entered by Oeum in the Sciritid. (27)\r\n\r\n (22) Or, \"effect a junction with.\"\r\n\r\n (23) Or, \"in practising gymnastics about the place of arms.\" See \"Pol.\r\n    Lac.\" xii. 5.\r\n\r\n (24) See \"Hell.\" IV. vii. 1; \"Ages.\" ii. 20.

See Leake, \"Morea,\" ii. 322; also \"Peloponn.\" p. 248, in\r\n    which place he corrects his former view as to the situation of\r\n    Leuctrum and the Maleatid.\r\n\r\n    Oeum or Ium, the chief town of the Sciritis, probably stood in the\r\n    Klisura or series of narrow passes through the watershed of the\r\n    mountains forming the natural boundary between Laconia and Arcadia\r\n    (in the direct line north from Sparta to Tegea), \"Dict. of Anc.\r\n    Geog.\" s.v. Leake says (\"Morea,\" iii. 19, 30 foll.) near the\r\n    modern village of Kolina; Baedeker (\"Greece,\" p. 269) says perhaps\r\n    at Palaeogoulas.\r\n\r\n    Caryae. This frontier town was apparently (near Arachova) on the\r\n    road from Thyrea (in the direction of the Argolid) to Sparta\r\n    (Thuc. v. 55; Paus. III. x. 7; Livy, xxxiv. 26, but see Leake,\r\n    \"Morea,\" iii. 30; \"Peloponn.\" p. 342).\r\n\r\n    Sellasia, probably rightly placed \"half an hour above Vourlia\"\r\n    (Baedeker, \"Greece,\" p. 269). The famous battle of Sellasia, in\r\n    the spring of B.C. 221, in which the united Macedonians under\r\n    Antigonus and the Achaeans finally broke the power of Sparta, was\r\n    fought in the little valley where the stream Gorgylus joins the\r\n    river Oenus and the Khan of Krevatas now stands. For a plan, see\r\n    \"Dict. of Anc. Geog.\" s.v.\r\n\r\n (26) \"Perioeci.\"\r\n\r\n (27) Diodorus (xv. 64) gives more details; he makes the invaders\r\n    converge upon Sellasia by four separate routes. See Leake,\r\n    \"Morea,\" iii. 29 foll.\r\n\r\nBy all accounts Ischolaus made a mistake in not advancing to meet them\r\non the difficult ground above Oeum. Had he done so, not a man, it is\r\nbelieved, would have scaled the passes there. But for the present,\r\nwishing to turn the help of the men of Oeum to good account, he waited\r\ndown in the village; and so the invading Arcadians scaled the heights\r\nin a body. At this crisis Ischolaus and his men, as long as they fought\r\nface to face with their foes, held the superiority; but, presently, when\r\nthe enemy, from rear and flank, and even from the dwelling-houses up\r\nwhich they scaled, rained blows and missiles upon them, then and there\r\nIscholaus met his end, and every man besides, save only one or two who,\r\nfailing to be recognised, effected their escape.\r\n\r\nAfter these achievements the Arcadians marched to join the Thebans\r\nat Caryae, and the Thebans, hearing what wonders the Arcadians had\r\nperformed, commenced their descent with far greater confidence. Their\r\nfirst exploit was to burn and ravage the district of Sellasia, but\r\nfinding themselves ere long in the flat land within the sacred enclosure\r\nof Apollo, they encamped for the night, and the next day continued\r\ntheir march along the Eurotas. When they came to the bridge they made\r\nno attempt to cross it to attack the city, for they caught sight of\r\nthe heavy infantry in the temple of Alea (28) ready to meet them. So,\r\nkeeping the Eurotas on their right, they tramped along, burning and\r\npillaging homesteads stocked with numerous stores. The feelings of the\r\ncitizens may well be imagined. The women who had never set eyes upon a\r\nfoe (29) could scarcely contain themselves as they beheld the cloud of\r\nsmoke. The Spartan warriors, inhabiting a city without fortifications,\r\nposted at intervals, here one and there another, were in truth what they\r\nappeared to be--the veriest handful. And these kept watch and ward. The\r\nauthorities passed a resolution to announce to the helots that whosoever\r\namong them chose to take arms and join a regiment should have his\r\nfreedom guaranteed to him by solemn pledges in return for assistance in\r\nthe common war. (30) More than six thousand helots, it is said, enrolled\r\nthemselves, so that a new terror was excited by the very incorporation\r\nof these men, whose numbers seemed to be excessive. But when it was\r\nfound that the mercenaries from Orchomenus remained faithful, and\r\nreinforcements came to Lacedaemon from Phlius, Corinth, Epidaurus,\r\nand Pellene, and some other states, the dread of these new levies was\r\nspeedily diminished.\r\n\r\n (28) See Pausanias, III. xix. 7.\r\n\r\n (29) See Plutarch, \"Ages.\" xxxi. 3 (Clough, vol. iv. p. 38); Aristot.\r\n    \"Pol.\" ii. 9-10.\r\n\r\n (30) See below, VII. ii. 2.\r\n\r\nThe enemy in his advance came to Amyclae. (31) Here he crossed the\r\nEurotas. The Thebans wherever they encamped at once formed a stockade\r\nof the fruit-trees they had felled, as thickly piled as possible, and\r\nso kept ever on their guard. The Arcadians did nothing of the sort.\r\nThey left their camping-ground and took themselves off to attack the\r\nhomesteads and loot. On the third or fourth day after their arrival the\r\ncavalry advanced, squadron by squadron, as far as the racecourse, (32)\r\nwithin the sacred enclosure of Gaiaochos. These consisted of the\r\nentire Theban cavalry and the Eleians, with as many of the Phocian\r\nor Thessalian or Locrian cavalry as were present. The cavalry of the\r\nLacedaemonians, looking a mere handful, were drawn up to meet them. They\r\nhad posted an ambuscade chosen from their heavy infantry, the younger\r\nmen, about three hundred in number, in the house of the Tyndarids (33);\r\nand while the cavalry charged, out rushed the three hundred at the\r\nsame instant at full pace. The enemy did not wait to receive the double\r\ncharge, but swerved, and at sight of that many also of the infantry took\r\nto headlong flight. But the pursuers presently paused; the Theban army\r\nremained motionless; and both parties returned to their camps. And\r\nnow the hope, the confidence strengthened that an attack upon the city\r\nitself would never come; nor did it. The invading army broke up from\r\ntheir ground, and marched off on the road to Helos and Gytheum. (34)\r\nThe unwalled cities were consigned to the flames, but Gytheum, where\r\nthe Lacedaemonians had their naval arsenal, was subjected to assault for\r\nthree days. Certain of the provincials (35) also joined in this attack,\r\nand shared the campaign with the Thebans and their friends.\r\n\r\n (31) For this ancient (Achaean) town, see Paus. III. ii. 6; Polyb. v.\r\n    19. It lay only twenty stades (a little more than two miles) from\r\n    the city of Sparta.\r\n\r\n (32) Or, \"hippodrome.\" See Paus. III. ii. 6.\r\n\r\n (33) Paus. III. xvi. 2.\r\n\r\n (34) See Baedeker's \"Greece,\" p. 279. Was Gytheum taken? See Grote,\r\n    \"H. G.\" x. 305; Curt. \"H. G.\" Eng. trans. iv. 431.\r\n\r\n (35) \"Perioeci.\" See above, III. iii. 6; VI. v. 25; below, VII. ii. 2;\r\n    Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 301. It is a pity that the historian should\r\n    hurry us off to Athens just at this point. The style here is\r\n    suggestive of notes ({upomnemata}) unexpanded.\r\n\r\nThe news of these proceedings set the Athenians deeply pondering\r\nwhat they ought to do concerning the Lacedaemonians, and they held an\r\nassembly in accordance with a resolution of the senate. It chanced that\r\nthe ambassadors of the Lacedaemonians and the allies still faithful\r\nto Lacedaemon were present. The Lacedaemonian ambassadors were Aracus,\r\nOcyllus, Pharax, Etymocles, and Olontheus, and from the nature of the\r\ncase they all used, roughly speaking, similar arguments. They reminded\r\nthe Athenians how they had often in old days stood happily together,\r\nshoulder to shoulder, in more than one great crisis. They (the\r\nLacedaemonians), on their side, had helped to expel the tyrant\r\nfrom Athens, and the Athenians, when Lacedaemon was besieged by the\r\nMessenians, had heartily leant her a helping hand. (36) Then they fell to\r\nenumerating all the blessings that marked the season when the two states\r\nshared a common policy, hinting how in common they had warred against\r\nthe barbarians, and more boldly recalling how the Athenians with the\r\nfull consent and advice of the Lacedaemonians were chosen by united\r\nHellas leaders of the common navy (37) and guardians of all the common\r\ntreasure, while they themselves were selected by all the Hellenes as\r\nconfessedly the rightful leaders on land; and this also not without the\r\nfull consent and concurrence of the Athenians.\r\n\r\n (36) In reference (1) to the expulsion of the Peisistratidae (Herod.\r\n    v. 64); (2) the \"third\" Messenian war (Thuc. i. 102).\r\n\r\n (37) See \"Revenues,\" v. 6.\r\n\r\nOne of the speakers ventured on a remark somewhat to this strain: \"If\r\nyou and we, sirs, can only agree, there is hope to-day that the old\r\nsaying may be fulfilled, and Thebes be 'taken and tithed.'\" (38) The\r\nAthenians, however, were not in the humour to listen to that style of\r\nargument. A sort of suppressed murmur ran through the assembly which\r\nseemed to say, \"That language may be well enough now; but when they\r\nwere well off they pressed hard enough on us.\" But of all the pleas put\r\nforward by the Lacedaemonians, the weightiest appeared to be this: that\r\nwhen they had reduced the Athenians by war, and the Thebans wished\r\nto wipe Athens off the face of the earth, they (the Lacedaemonians)\r\nthemselves had opposed the measure. (39) If that was the argument of\r\nmost weight, the reasoning which was the most commonly urged was to the\r\neffect that \"the solemn oaths necessitated the aid demanded. Sparta had\r\ndone no wrong to justify this invasion on the part of the Arcadians and\r\ntheir allies. All she had done was to assist the men of Tegea when\r\n(40) the Mantineans had marched against that township contrary to\r\ntheir solemn oaths.\" Again, for the second time, at these expressions\r\na confused din ran through the assembly, half the audience maintaining\r\nthat the Mantineans were justified in supporting Proxenus and his\r\nfriends, who were put to death by the party with Stasippus; the other\r\nhalf that they were wrong in bringing an armed force against the men of\r\nTegea.\r\n\r\n (38) Or, \"the Thebans be decimated\"; for the phrase see above, \"Hell.\"\r\n    VI. iii. 20.\r\n\r\n (39) See \"Hell.\" II. ii. 19; and \"Hell.\" III. v. 8.\r\n\r\n (40) Lit. \"because,\" {oti}.\r\n\r\nWhilst these distinctions were being drawn by the assembly itself,\r\nCleiteles the Corinthian got up and spoke as follows: \"I daresay, men\r\nof Athens, there is a double answer to the question, Who began the\r\nwrongdoing? But take the case of ourselves. Since peace began, no one\r\ncan accuse us either of wantonly attacking any city, or of seizing the\r\nwealth of any, or of ravaging a foreign territory. In spite of which the\r\nThebans have come into our country and cut down our fruit-trees, burnt\r\nto the ground our houses, filched and torn to pieces our cattle and our\r\ngoods. How then, I put it to you, will you not be acting contrary to\r\nyour solemn oaths if you refuse your aid to us, who are so manifestly\r\nthe victims of wrongdoings? Yes; and when I say solemn oaths, I speak\r\nof oaths and undertakings which you yourselves took great pains to exact\r\nfrom all of us.\" At that point a murmur of applause greeted Cleiteles,\r\nthe Athenians feeling the truth and justice of the speaker's language.\r\n\r\nHe sat down, and then Procles of Phlius got up and spoke as follows:\r\n\"What would happen, men of Athens, if the Lacedaemonians were well out\r\nof the way? The answer to that question is obvious. You would be the\r\nfirst object of Theban invasion. Clearly; for they must feel that you\r\nand you alone stand in the path between them and empire over Hellas. If\r\nthis be so, I do not consider that you are more supporting Lacedaemon\r\nby a campaign in her behalf than you are helping yourselves. For imagine\r\nthe Thebans, your own sworn foes and next-door neighbours, masters of\r\nHellas! You will find it a painful and onerous exchange indeed for the\r\ndistant antagonism of Sparta. As a mere matter of self-interest, now\r\nis the time to help yourselves, while you may still reckon upon allies,\r\ninstead of waiting until they are lost, and you are forced to fight\r\na life-and-death battle with the Thebans single-handed. But the fear\r\nsuggests itself, that should the Lacedaemonians escape now, they will\r\nlive to cause you trouble at some future date. Lay this maxim to heart,\r\nthen, that it is not the potential greatness of those we benefit, but of\r\nthose we injure, which causes apprehension. And this other also, that\r\nit behoves individuals and states alike so to better their position (41)\r\nwhile yet in the zenith of their strength that, in the day of weakness,\r\nwhen it comes, they may find some succour and support in what their\r\nformer labours have achieved. (42) To you now, at this time, a\r\nheaven-sent opportunity is presented. In return for assistance to the\r\nLacedaemonians in their need, you may win their sincere, unhesitating\r\nfriendship for all time. Yes, I say it deliberately, for the acceptance\r\nof these benefits at your hands will not be in the presence of one or\r\ntwo chance witnesses. The all-seeing gods, in whose sight to-morrow is\r\neven as to-day, will be cognisant of these things. The knowledge of them\r\nwill be jointly attested by allies and enemies; nay, by Hellenes and\r\nbarbarians alike, since to not one of them is what we are doing a\r\nmatter of unconcern. If, then, in the presence of these witnesses, the\r\nLacedaemonians should prove base towards you, no one will ever again\r\nbe eager in their cause. But our hope, our expectation should rather be\r\nthat they will prove themselves good men and not base; since they beyond\r\nall others would seem persistently to have cherished a high endeavour,\r\nreaching forth after true praise, and holding aloof from ugly deeds.\r\n\r\n (41) Lit. \"to acquire some good.\"\r\n\r\n (42) Or, \"for what,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\"But there are further considerations which it were well you should lay\r\nto heart. If danger were ever again to visit Hellas from the barbarian\r\nworld outside, in whom would you place your confidence if not in the\r\nLacedaemonians? Whom would you choose to stand at your right hand in\r\nbattle if not these, whose soldiers at Thermopylae to a man preferred to\r\nfall at their posts rather than save their lives by giving the barbarian\r\nfree passage into Hellas? Is it not right, then, considering for\r\nwhat thing's sake they displayed that bravery in your companionship,\r\nconsidering also the good hope there is that they will prove the like\r\nagain--is it not just that you and we should lend them all countenance\r\nand goodwill? Nay, even for us their allies' sake, who are present, it\r\nwould be worth your while to manifest this goodwill. Need you be assured\r\nthat precisely those who continue faithful to them in their misfortunes\r\nwould in like manner be ashamed not to requite you with gratitude?\r\nAnd if we seem to be but small states, who are willing to share their\r\ndangers with them, lay to heart that there is a speedy cure for this\r\ndefect: with the accession of your city the reproach that, in spite of\r\nall our assistance, we are but small cities, will cease to be.\r\n\r\n\"For my part, men of Athens, I have hitherto on hearsay admired and\r\nenvied this great state, whither, I was told, every one who was wronged\r\nor stood in terror of aught needed only to betake himself and he would\r\nobtain assistance. To-day I no longer hear, I am present myself and\r\nsee these famous citizens of Lacedaemon here, and by their side their\r\ntrustiest friends, who have come to you, and ask you in their day of\r\nneed to give them help. I see Thebans also, the same who in days bygone\r\nfailed to persuade the Lacedaemonians to reduce you to absolute slavery,\r\n(43) to-day asking you to suffer those who saved you to be destroyed.\r\n\r\n (43) See \"Hell.\" II. ii. 19; III. v. 8, in reference to B.C. 405.\r\n\r\n\"That was a great deed and of fair renown, attributed in old story to\r\nyour ancestors, that they did not suffer those Argives who died on the\r\nCadmeia (44) to lie unburied; but a fairer wreath of glory would\r\nyou weave for your own brows if you suffer not these still living\r\nLacedaemonians to be trampled under the heel of insolence and destroyed.\r\nFair, also, was that achievement when you stayed the insolence of\r\nEurystheus and saved the sons of Heracles; (45) but fairer still than\r\nthat will your deed be if you rescue from destruction, not the primal\r\nauthors (46) merely, but the whole city which they founded; fairest of\r\nall, if because yesterday the Lacedaemonians won you your preservation\r\nby a vote which cost them nothing, you to-day shall bring them help with\r\narms, and at the price of peril. It is a proud day for some of us to\r\nstand here and give what aid we can in pleading for assistance to brave\r\nmen. What, then, must you feel, who in very deed are able to render\r\nthat assistance! How generous on your parts, who have been so often the\r\nfriends and foes of Lacedaemon, to forget the injury and remember only\r\nthe good they have done! How noble of you to repay, not for yourselves\r\nonly, but for the sake of Hellas, the debt due to those who proved\r\nthemselves good men and true in her behalf!\"\r\n\r\n (44) In reference to the Seven against Thebes, see Herod.

The\r\nassembly finally passed a decree to send assistance to Lacedaemon in\r\nforce, and they chose Iphicrates general. Then followed the preliminary\r\nsacrifices, and then the general's order to his troops to take the\r\nevening meal in the grove of the Academy. (48) But the general himself,\r\nit is said, was in no hurry to leave the city; many were found at their\r\nposts before him. Presently, however, he put himself at the head of his\r\ntroops, and the men followed cheerily, in firm persuasion that he was\r\nabout to lead them to some noble exploit. On arrival at Corinth\r\nhe frittered away some days, and there was a momentary outburst of\r\ndiscontent at so much waste of precious time; but as soon as he led the\r\ntroops out of Corinth there was an obvious rebound.

(Eng. tr.)\r\n\r\n (48) See Baedeker, \"Greece,\" p. 103.\r\n\r\nAnd now reverting to the hostile forces on Laconian territory, we find\r\nthat the Arcadians, Argives, and Eleians had retired in large numbers.\r\nThey had every inducement so to do since their homes bordered on\r\nLaconia; and off they went, driving or carrying whatever they had\r\nlooted. The Thebans and the rest were no less anxious to get out of the\r\ncountry, though for other reasons, partly because the army was melting\r\naway under their eyes day by day, partly because the necessities of life\r\nwere growing daily scantier, so much had been either fairly eaten up\r\nand pillaged or else recklessly squandered and reduced to ashes. Besides\r\nthis, it was winter; so that on every ground there was a general desire\r\nby this time to get away home.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the enemy began his retreat from Laconian soil, Iphicrates\r\nimitated his movement, and began leading back his troops out of Arcadia\r\ninto Corinthia. Iphicrates exhibited much good generalship, no doubt,\r\nwith which I have no sort of fault to find. But it is not so with that\r\nfinal feature of the campaign to which we are now come. Here I find his\r\nstrategy either meaningless in intent or inadequate in execution.\r\nHe made an attempt to keep guard at Oneion, in order to prevent the\r\nBoeotians making their way out homewards; but left meanwhile far the\r\nbest passage through Cenchreae unguarded. Again, when he wished to\r\ndiscover whether or not the Thebans had passed Oneion, he sent out on\r\na reconnaissance the whole of the Athenian and Corinthian cavalry;\r\nwhereas, for the object in view, the eyes of a small detachment would\r\nhave been as useful as a whole regiment; (49) and when it came to\r\nfalling back, clearly the smaller number had a better chance of hitting\r\non a traversable road, and so effecting the desired movement quietly.\r\nBut the height of folly seems to have been reached when he threw into\r\nthe path of the enemy a large body of troops which were still too weak\r\nto cope with him. As a matter of fact, this body of cavalry, owing to\r\ntheir very numbers, could not help covering a large space of ground;\r\nand when it became necessary to retire, had to cling to a series of\r\ndifficult positions in succession, so that they lost not fewer than\r\ntwenty horsemen. (50) It was thus the Thebans effected their object and\r\nretired from Peloponnese.\r\n\r\n (49) See \"Hipparch.\" viii. 10 foll.\r\n\r\n (50) See Diod. xv. 63; Plut. \"Pelop.\" 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nB.C. 369. In the following year (1) plenipotentiary ambassadors (2) from\r\nthe Lacedaemonians and their allies arrived at Athens to consider and\r\ntake counsel in what way the alliance between Athens and Lacedaemon\r\nmight be best cemented. It was urged by many speakers, foreigners and\r\nAthenians also, that the alliance ought to be based on the principle of\r\nabsolute equality, (3) \"share and share alike,\" when Procles of Phlius\r\nput forward the following argument:\r\n\r\n (1) I.e. the official year from spring to spring. See Peter, \"Chron.\r\n    Table\" 95, note 215; see Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 346, note 1.\r\n\r\n (2) See Hicks, 89.\r\n\r\n (3) For the phrase {epi toi isois kai omoiois}, implying \"share and\r\n    share alike,\" see Thuc. i. 145, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Since you have already decided, men of Athens, that it is good to\r\nsecure the friendship of Lacedaemon, the point, as it appears to me,\r\nwhich you ought now to consider is, by what means this friendship may be\r\nmade to last as long as possible. The probability is, that we shall hold\r\ntogether best by making a treaty which shall suit the best interests of\r\nboth parties. On most points we have, I believe, a tolerable unanimity,\r\nbut there remains the question of leadership. The preliminary decree of\r\nyour senate anticipates a division of the hegemony, crediting you with\r\nthe chief maritime power, Lacedaemon with the chief power on land; and\r\nto me, personally, I confess, that seems a division not more established\r\nby human invention than preordained by some divine naturalness or happy\r\nfortune. For, in the first place, you have a geographical position\r\npre-eminently adapted for naval supremacy; most of the states to whom\r\nthe sea is important are massed round your own, and all of these are\r\ninferior to you in strength. Besides, you have harbours and roadsteads,\r\nwithout which it is not possible to turn a naval power to account.\r\nAgain, you have many ships of war. To extend your naval empire is a\r\ntraditional policy; all the arts and sciences connected with these\r\nmatters you possess as home products, and, what is more, in skill and\r\nexperience of nautical affairs you are far ahead of the rest of the\r\nworld. The majority of you derive your livelihood from the sea, or\r\nthings connected with it; so that in the very act of minding your own\r\naffairs you are training yourselves to enter the lists of naval combat.\r\n(4) Again, no other power in the world can send out a larger collective\r\nfleet, and that is no insignificant point in reference to the\r\nquestion of leadership. The nucleus of strength first gained becomes\r\na rallying-point, round which the rest of the world will gladly\r\ncongregate. Furthermore, your good fortune in this department must\r\nbe looked upon as a definite gift of God: for, consider among the\r\nnumberless great sea-fights which you have fought how few you have\r\nlost, how many you have won. It is only rational, then, that your allies\r\nshould much prefer to share this particular risk with you. Indeed,\r\nto show you how natural and vital to you is this maritime study, the\r\nfollowing reflection may serve. For several years the Lacedaemonians,\r\nwhen at war with you in old days, dominated your territory, but they\r\nmade no progress towards destroying you. At last God granted them one\r\nday to push forward their dominion on the sea, and then in an instant\r\nyou completely succumbed to them. (5) Is it not self-evident that\r\nyour safety altogether depends upon the sea? The sea is your natural\r\nelement--your birthright; it would be base indeed to entrust the\r\nhegemony of it to the Lacedaemonians, and the more so, since, as they\r\nthemselves admit, they are far less acquainted with this business than\r\nyourselves; and, secondly, your risk in naval battles would not be for\r\nequal stakes--theirs involving only the loss of the men on board their\r\nships, but yours, that of your children and your wives and the entire\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n (4) See \"Pol. Ath.\" i. 19 foll.\r\n\r\n (5) See \"Hell.\" II. i.\r\n\r\n\"And if this is a fair statement of your position, turn, now, and\r\nconsider that of the Lacedaemonians. The first point to notice is, that\r\nthey are an inland power; as long as they are dominant on land it does\r\nnot matter how much they are cut off from the sea--they can carry\r\non existence happily enough. This they so fully recognise, that from\r\nboyhood they devote themselves to training for a soldier's life. The\r\nkeystone of this training is obedience to command, (6) and in this they\r\nhold the same pre-eminence on land which you hold on the sea. Just as\r\nyou with your fleets, so they on land can, at a moment's notice, put\r\nthe largest army in the field; and with the like consequence, that their\r\nallies, as is only rational, attach themselves to them with undying\r\ncourage. (7) Further, God has granted them to enjoy on land a like good\r\nfortune to that vouchsafed to you on sea. Among all the many contests\r\nthey have entered into, it is surprising in how few they have failed, in\r\nhow many they have been successful. The same unflagging attention which\r\nyou pay to maritime affairs is required from them on land, and, as the\r\nfacts of history reveal, it is no less indispensable to them. Thus,\r\nalthough you were at war with them for several years and gained many a\r\nnaval victory over them, you never advanced a step nearer to reducing\r\nthem. But once worsted on land, in an instant they were confronted with\r\na danger affecting the very lives of child and wife, and vital to the\r\ninterests of the entire state. We may very well understand, then, the\r\nstrangeness, not to say monstrosity, in their eyes, of surrendering to\r\nothers the military leadership on land, in matters which they have made\r\ntheir special study for so long and with such eminent success. I end\r\nwhere I began. I agree absolutely with the preliminary decrees of your\r\nown senate, which I consider the solution most advantageous to both\r\nparties. My prayer (8) is that you may be guided in your deliberations\r\nto that conclusion which is best for each and all of us.\"\r\n\r\n (6) Or, \"the spirit of discipline.\" See \"Mem.\" III. v. 16; IV. iv. 15;\r\n    Thuc. ii. 39; \"Pol. Lac.\" viii.\r\n\r\n (7) Or, \"with unlimited confidence.\"\r\n\r\n (8) See above, \"Hell.\" VI. i. 13, {kai su prattois ta kratista}, \"and\r\n    so may the best fortune attend you!\"--if that reading and\r\n    rendering be adopted.\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the orator, and the sentiments of his speech were\r\nvehemently applauded by the Athenians no less than by the Lacedaemonians\r\nwho were present. Then Cephisodotus (9) stepped forward and addressed\r\nthe assembly. He said, \"Men of Athens, do you not see how you are being\r\ndeluded? Lend me your ears, and I will prove it to you in a moment.\r\nThere is no doubt about your leadership by sea: it is already secured.\r\nBut suppose the Lacedaemonians in alliance with you: it is plain they\r\nwill send you admirals and captains, and possibly marines, of Laconian\r\nbreed; but who will the sailors be? Helots obviously, or mercenaries\r\nof some sort. These are the folk over whom you will exercise your\r\nleadership. Reverse the case. The Lacedaemonians have issued a general\r\norder summoning you to join them in the field; it is plain again, you\r\nwill be sending your heavy infantry and your cavalry. You see what\r\nfollows. You have invented a pretty machine, by which they become leaders\r\nof your very selves, and you become the leaders either of their slaves\r\nor of the dregs of their state. I should like to put a question to the\r\nLacedaemonian Timocrates seated yonder. Did you not say just now, Sir,\r\nthat you came to make an alliance on terms of absolute equality, 'share\r\nand share alike'? Answer me.\" \"I did say so.\" \"Well, then, here is a\r\nplan by which you get the perfection of equality. I cannot conceive of\r\nanything more fair and impartial than that 'turn and turn about' each\r\nof us should command the navy, each the army; whereby whatever advantage\r\nthere may be in maritime or military command we may each of us share.\"\r\n\r\n (9) See above, \"Hell.\" VI. iii. 2; Hicks, 87.\r\n\r\nThese arguments were successful. The Athenians were converted, and\r\npassed a decree vesting the command in either state (10) for periods of\r\nfive days alternately.\r\n\r\n (10) See \"Revenues,\" v. 7.\r\n\r\nB.C. 369. (11) The campaign was commenced by both Athenians and\r\nLacedaemonians with their allies, marching upon Corinth, where it was\r\nresolved to keep watch and ward over Oneion jointly. On the advance of\r\nthe Thebans and their allies the troops were drawn out to defend the\r\npass. They were posted in detachments at different points, the most\r\nassailable of which was assigned to the Lacedaemonians and the men of\r\nPellene. (12)\r\n\r\n (11) See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 349 foll.; al. B.C. 368.\r\n\r\n (12) \"During the wars of Epameinondas Pellene adhered firmly to her\r\n    Spartan policy, at a time when other cities were, to say the\r\n    least, less strenuous in the Spartan cause.\"--Freeman, \"Hist. Fed.\r\n    Gov.\" p. 241. Afterwards Pellene is found temporarily on the\r\n    Theban side (\"Hell.\" VII. ii. 11).\r\n\r\nThe Thebans and their allies, finding themselves within three or four\r\nmiles (13) of the troops guarding the pass, encamped in the flat ground\r\nbelow; but presently, after a careful calculation of the time it would\r\ntake to start and reach the goal in the gloaming, they advanced against\r\nthe Lacedaemonian outposts. In spite of the difficulty they timed their\r\nmovements to a nicety, and fell upon the Lacedaemonians and Pellenians\r\njust at the interval when the night pickets were turning in and the men\r\nwere leaving their shakedowns and retiring for necessary purposes. (14)\r\nThis was the instant for the Thebans to fling themselves upon them; they\r\nplied their weapons with good effect, blow upon blow. Order was pitted\r\nagainst disorder, preparation against disarray. When, however, those who\r\nescaped from the thick of the business had retired to the nearest rising\r\nground, the Lacedaemonian polemarch, who might have taken as many heavy,\r\nor light, infantry of the allies as he wanted, and thus have held the\r\nposition (no bad one, since it enabled him to get his supplies safely\r\nenough from Cenchreae), failed to do so. On the contrary, and in spite\r\nof the great perplexity of the Thebans as to how they were to get down\r\nfrom the high level facing Sicyon or else retire the way they came,\r\nthe Spartan general made a truce, which in the opinion of the majority,\r\nseemed more in favour of the Thebans than himself, and so he withdrew\r\nhis division and fell back.\r\n\r\n (13) Lit. \"thirty stades.\"\r\n\r\n (14) Or, \"intent on their personal concerns.\" See \"Hell.\" II. iv. 6;\r\n    \"Hipparch.\" vii. 12.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans were now free to descend without hindrance, which they did;\r\nand, effecting a junction with their allies the Arcadians, Argives,\r\nand Eleians, at once attacked (15) Sicyon and Pellene, and, marching on\r\nEpidaurus, laid waste the whole territory of that people. Returning from\r\nthat exploit with a consummate disdain for all their opponents, when\r\nthey found themselves near the city of Corinth they advanced at the\r\ndouble against the gate facing towards Phlius; intending if they found\r\nit open to rush in. However, a body of light troops sallied out of the\r\ncity to the rescue, and met the advance of the Theban picked corps (16)\r\nnot one hundred and fifty yards (17) from the walls. Mounting on the\r\nmonuments and commanding eminences, with volleys of sling stones and\r\narrows they laid low a pretty large number in the van of the attack,\r\nand routing them, gave chase for three or four furlongs' (18) distance.\r\nAfter this incident the Corinthians dragged the corpses of the slain\r\nto the wall, and finally gave them up under a flag of truce, erecting a\r\ntrophy to record the victory. As a result of this occurrence the allies\r\nof the Lacedaemonians took fresh heart.\r\n\r\n (15) And took (apparently); see below; Diod. xv. 69.\r\n\r\n (16) See \"Anab.\" III. iv. 43; and above, \"Hell.\" V. iii. 23.\r\n\r\n (17) Lit. \"four plethra.\"\r\n\r\n (18) LIt. \"three or four stades.\"\r\n\r\nAt the date of the above transactions the Lacedeamonians were cheered by\r\nthe arrival of a naval reinforcement from Dionysius, consisting of more\r\nthan twenty warships, which conveyed a body of Celts and Iberians and\r\nabout fifty cavalry. The day following, the Thebans and the rest of the\r\nallies, posted, at intervals, in battle order, and completely filling\r\nthe flat land down to the sea on one side, and up to the knolls on\r\nthe other which form the buttresses of the city, proceeded to destroy\r\neverything precious they could lay their hands on in the plain. The\r\nAthenian and Corinthian cavalry, eyeing the strength, physical and\r\nnumerical, of their antagonists, kept at a safe distance from their\r\narmament. But the little body of cavalry lately arrived from Dionysius\r\nspread out in a long thin line, and one at one point and one at another\r\ngalloped along the front, discharging their missiles as they dashed\r\nforward, and when the enemy rushed against them, retired, and again\r\nwheeling about, showered another volley. Even while so engaged they\r\nwould dismount from their horses and take breath; and if their foemen\r\ngalloped up while they were so dismounted, in an instant they had leapt\r\non their horses' backs and were in full retreat. Or if, again, a party\r\npursued them some distance from the main body, as soon as they turned to\r\nretire, they would press upon them, and discharging volleys of missiles,\r\nmade terrible work, forcing the whole army to advance and retire, merely\r\nto keep pace with the movements of fifty horsemen.\r\n\r\nB.C. 369-368. After this the Thebans remained only a few more days\r\nand then turned back homewards; and the rest likewise to their several\r\nhomes. Thereupon the troops sent by Dionysius attacked Sicyon. Engaging\r\nthe Sicyonians in the flat country, they defeated them, killing about\r\nseventy men and capturing by assault the fortres of Derae. (19) After\r\nthese achievements this first reinforcement from Dionysius re-embarked\r\nand set sail for Syracuse.\r\n\r\n (19) \"East of Sicyon was Epieiceia (see above, \"Hell.\" IV. ii. 14, iv.\r\n    13) on the river Nemea. In the same direction was the fortress\r\n    Derae.\" (\"Dict. Anct. Geog.\" \"Topography of Sicyonia\"), al. Gerae.\r\n    So Leake (\"Morea,\" iii. 376), who conjectures that this fortress\r\n    was in the maritime plain.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the Thebans and all the states which had revolted from\r\nLacedaemon had acted together in perfect harmony, and were content to\r\ncampaign under the leadership of Thebes; but now a certain Lycomedes,\r\n(20) a Mantinean, broke the spell. Inferior in birth and position\r\nto none, while in wealth superior, he was for the rest a man of high\r\nambition. This man was able to inspire the Arcadians with high thoughts\r\nby reminding them that to Arcadians alone the Peloponnese was in\r\na literal sense a fatherland; since they and they alone were the\r\nindigenous inhabitants of its sacred soil, and the Arcadian stock\r\nthe largest among the Hellenic tribes--a good stock, moreover, and of\r\nincomparable physique. And then he set himself to panegyrise them as the\r\nbravest of the brave, adducing as evidence, if evidence were needed,\r\nthe patent fact, that every one in need of help invariably turned to\r\nthe Arcadians. (21) Never in old days had the Lacedaemonians yet invaded\r\nAthens without the Arcadians. \"If then,\" he added, \"you are wise, you\r\nwill be somewhat chary of following at the beck and call of anybody,\r\nor it will be the old story again. As when you marched in the train\r\nof Sparta you only enhanced her power, so to-day, if you follow Theban\r\nguidance without thought or purpose instead of claiming a division of\r\nthe headship, you will speedily find, perhaps, in her only a second\r\nedition of Lacedaemon.\" (22)\r\n\r\n (20) For the plan of an Arcadian Federation and the part played by\r\n    Lycomedes, its true author, \"who certainly merits thereby a high\r\n    place among the statesmen of Greece,\" see Freeman, \"Hist. Fed.\r\n    Gov.\" ch. iv. p. 199 foll.\r\n\r\n (21) For this claim on the part of the Arcadians, see \"Anab.\" VI. ii.\r\n    10 foll.\r\n\r\n (22) Or, \"Lacedaemonians under another name.\"\r\n\r\nThese words uttered in the ears of the Arcadians were sufficient to puff\r\nthem up with pride. They were lavish in their love of Lycomedes, and\r\nthought there was no one his equal. He became their hero; he had only\r\nto give his orders, and they appointed their magistrates (23) at his\r\nbidding. But, indeed, a series of brilliant exploits entitled the\r\nArcadians to magnify themselves. The first of these arose out of an\r\ninvasion of Epidaurus by the Argives, which seemed likely to end in\r\ntheir finding their escape barred by Chabrias and his foreign brigade\r\nwith the Athenians and Corinthians. Only, at the critical moment the\r\nArcadians came to the rescue and extricated the Argives, who were\r\nclosely besieged, and this in spite not only of the enemy, but of the\r\nsavage nature of the ground itself. Again they marched on Asine (24) in\r\nLaconian territory, and defeated the Lacedaemonian garrison, putting\r\nthe polemarch Geranor, who was a Spartan, to the sword, and sacking the\r\nsuburbs of the town. Indeed, whenever or wherever they had a mind to\r\nsend an invading force, neither night nor wintry weather, nor length of\r\nroad nor mountain barrier could stay their march. So that at this date\r\nthey regarded their prowess as invincible. (25) The Thebans, it will be\r\nunderstood, could not but feel a touch of jealousy at these pretensions,\r\nand their former friendship to the Arcadians lost its ardour. With the\r\nEleians, indeed, matters were worse. The revelation came to them when\r\nthey demanded back from the Arcadians certain cities (26) of which the\r\nLacedaemonians had deprived them. They discovered that their views\r\nwere held of no account, but that the Triphylians and the rest who had\r\nrevolted from them were to be made much of, because they claimed to\r\nbe Arcadians. (27) Hence, as contrasted with the Thebans, the Eleians\r\ncherished feelings towards their late friends which were positively\r\nhostile.\r\n\r\n (23) {arkhontas}, see below, \"Hell.\" VII. iv. 33. The formal title of\r\n    these Federal magistrates may or may not have been {arkhontes};\r\n    Freeman, \"H. F. G.\" 203, note 6.\r\n\r\n (24) See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 356.\r\n\r\n (25) Or, \"regarded themselves as the very perfection of soldiery.\"\r\n\r\n (26) In reference to \"Hell.\" III. ii. 25 foll., see Freeman, op. cit.\r\n    p. 201, and below, \"Hell.\" VII. iv. 12 (B.C. 365); Busolt, op.\r\n    cit. p. 186 foll., in reference to Lasion.\r\n\r\n (27) Busolt, p. 150.\r\n\r\nB.C. 368. Self-esteem amounting to arrogance--such was the spirit which\r\nanimated each section of the allies, when a new phase was introduced by\r\nthe arrival of Philiscus (28) of Abydos on an embassy from Ariobarzanes\r\n(29) with large sums of money. This agent's first step was to assemble\r\na congress of Thebans, allies, and Lacedaemonians at Delphi to treat\r\nof peace. On their arrival, without attempting to communicate or take\r\ncounsel with the god as to how peace might be re-established, they fell\r\nto deliberating unassisted; and when the Thebans refused to acquiesce\r\nin the dependency of Messene (30) upon Lacedaemon, Philiscus set about\r\ncollecting a large foreign brigade to side with Lacedaemon and to\r\nprosecute the war.\r\n\r\n (28) See Hicks, 84, p. 152; Kohler, \"C. I. A.\" ii. 51; Grote, \"H. G.\"\r\n    x. 357; Curtius, \"H. G.\" (Eng. tr.) iv. 458; Diod. xv. 90.\r\n\r\n (29) See above, V. i. 28; \"Ages.\" ii. 26.\r\n\r\n (30) See Hicks, 86.\r\n\r\nWhilst these matters were still pending, the second reinforcements from\r\nDionysius (31) arrived. There was a difference of opinion as to where\r\nthe troops should be employed, the Athenians insisting that they ought\r\nto march into Thessaly to oppose the Thebans, the Lacedaemonians being\r\nin favour of Laconia; and among the allies this latter opinion carried\r\nthe day. The reinforcement from Dionysius accordingly sailed round to\r\nLaconia, where Archidamus incorporated them with the state troops and\r\nopened the campaign. Caryae he took by storm, and put every one captured\r\nto the sword, and from this point marching straight upon the Parrhasians\r\nof Arcadia, he set about ravaging the country along with his Syracusan\r\nsupporters.\r\n\r\n (31) See above, SS. 20, 22, p. 191 foll. The date is B.C. 368\r\n    according to Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 362 foll.; al. B.C. 367.\r\n\r\nPresently when the Arcadians and Argives arrived with succours, he\r\nretreated and encamped on the knolls above Medea. (32) While he was\r\nthere, Cissidas, the officer in charge of the reinforcement from\r\nDionysius, made the announcement that the period for his stay abroad had\r\nelapsed; and the words were no sooner out of his lips than off he set on\r\nthe road to Sparta. The march itself, however, was not effected without\r\ndelays, for he was met and cut off by a body of Messenians at a narrow\r\npass, and was forced in these straits to send to Archidamus and beg for\r\nassistance, which the latter tendered. When they had got as far as the\r\nbend (33) on the road to Eutresia, there were the Arcadians and Argives\r\nadvancing upon Laconia and apparently intending, like the Messenians, to\r\nshut the Spartan off from the homeward road.\r\n\r\n (32) Or, \"Melea,\" or \"Malea.\" E. Curtius conjectures {Meleas} for\r\n    {Medeas} of the MSS., and probably the place referred to is the\r\n    township of Malea in the Aegytis (Pausan. VIII. xxvii. 4); see\r\n    above, \"Hell.\" VI. v. 24, \"the Maleatid.\" See Dind. \"Hist. Gr.,\"\r\n    Ox. MDCCCLIII., note ad loc.; Curtius, \"H.

Arist.\r\n    \"Frogs,\" 113. \"Medea,\" below, is probably \"Malea,\" (see last\r\n    note).\r\n\r\nArchidamus, debouching upon a flat space of ground where the roads to\r\nEutresia and Medea converge, drew up his troops and offered battle. When\r\nhappened then is thus told:--He passed in front of the regiments and\r\naddressed them in terms of encouragement thus: \"Fellow-citizens, the day\r\nhas come which calls upon us to prove ourselves brave men and look the\r\nworld in the face with level eyes. (34) Now are we to deliver to those\r\nwho come after us our fatherland intact as we received it from our\r\nfathers; now will we cease hanging our heads in shame before our\r\nchildren and wives, our old men and our foreign friends, in sight\r\nof whom in days of old we shone forth conspicuous beyond all other\r\nHellenes.\"\r\n\r\n (34) See Plut. \"Ages.\" 53 (Clough, vol. iv. p. 41).\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely uttered (so runs the tale), when out of\r\nthe clear sky came lightnings and thunderings, (35) with propitious\r\nmanifestation to him; and it so happened that on his right wing there\r\nstood a sacred enclosure and a statue of Heracles, his great ancestor.\r\nAs the result of all these things, so deep a strength and courage came\r\ninto the hearts of his soldiers, as they tell, that the generals had\r\nhard work to restrain their men as they pushed forward to the front.\r\nPresently, when Archidamus led the advance, a few only of the enemy\r\ncared to await them at the spear's point, and were slain; the mass of\r\nthem fled, and fleeing fell. Many were cut down by the cavalry, many\r\nby the Celts. When the battle ceased and a trophy had been erected, the\r\nSpartan at once despatched home Demoteles, the herald, with the news. He\r\nhad to announce not only the greatness of the victory, but the startling\r\nfact that, while the enemy's dead were numerous, not one single\r\nLacedaemonian had been slain. (36) Those in Sparta to whom the news was\r\nbrought, as says the story, when they heard it, one and all, beginning\r\nwith Agesilaus, and, after him, the elders and the ephors, wept for\r\njoy--so close akin are tears to joy and pain alike. There were others\r\nhardly less pleased than the Lacedaemonians themselves at the\r\nmisfortune which had overtaken the Arcadians: these were the Thebans and\r\nEleians--so offensive to them had the boastful behaviour of these men\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\n (35) See Xen. \"Apolog.\" 12; Homer, \"Il.\" ii. 353; \"Od.\" xx. 113 foll.\r\n\r\n (36) According to Diod. xv. 72, ten thousand of the enemy fell.\r\n\r\nThe problem perpetually working in the minds of the Thebans was how they\r\nwere to compass the headship of Hellas; and they persuaded themselves\r\nthat, if they sent an embassy to the King of Persia, they could not but\r\ngain some advantage by his help. Accordingly they did not delay, but\r\ncalled together the allies, on the plea that Euthycles the Lacedaemonian\r\nwas already at the Persian court. The commissioners sent up were, on\r\nthe part of the Thebans, Pelopidas; (37) on the part of the Arcadians,\r\nAntiochus, the pancratiast; and on that of the Eleians, Archidamus.\r\nThere was also an Argive in attendance. The Athenians on their side,\r\ngetting wind of the matter, sent up two commissioners, Timagoras and\r\nLeon.\r\n\r\n (37) See Plut. \"Pelop.\" 30 (Clough, vol. ii. p. 230). For the date see\r\n    Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 365, 379; Curtius, \"H. G.\" iv. 460.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the Persian court the influence of Pelopidas was\r\npreponderant with the Persian. He could point out that, besides the fact\r\nthat the Thebans alone among all the Hellenes had fought on the king's\r\nside at Plataeae, (38) they had never subsequently engaged in military\r\nservice against the Persians; nay, the very ground of Lacedaemonian\r\nhostility to them was that they had refused to march against the Persian\r\nking with Agesilaus, (39) and would not even suffer him to sacrifice to\r\nArtemis at Aulis (where Agamemnon sacrificed before he set sail for Asia\r\nand captured Troy). In addition, there were two things which contributed\r\nto raise the prestige of Thebes, and redounded to the honour of\r\nPelopidas. These were the victory of the Thebans at Leuctra, and the\r\nindisputable fact that they had invaded and laid waste the territory of\r\nLaconia. Pelopidas went on to point out that the Argives and Arcadians\r\nhad lately been defeated in battle by the Lacedaemonians, when his own\r\ncountrymen were not there to assist. The Athenian Timagoras supported\r\nall these statements of the Theban by independent testimony, and stood\r\nsecond in honour after Pelopidas.\r\n\r\n (38) See Thuc. iii. 58, 59, 60.\r\n\r\n (39) See above, \"Hell.\" III. iv. 3; Lincke, \"Zur. Xen. Krit.\" p. 315.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the proceedings Pelopidas was asked by the king, what\r\nspecial clause he desired inserted in the royal rescript. He replied as\r\nfollows: \"Messene to be independent of Lacedaemon, and the Athenians\r\nto lay up their ships of war. Should either power refuse compliance in\r\nthese respects, such refusal to be a casus belli; and any state refusing\r\nto take part in the military proceedings consequent, to be herself the\r\nfirst object of attack.\" These clauses were drawn up and read to the\r\nambassadors, when Leon, in the hearing of the king, exclaimed: \"Upon my\r\nword! Athenians, it strikes me it is high time you looked for some other\r\nfriend than the great king.\" The secretary reported the comment of the\r\nAthenian envoy, and produced presently an altered copy of the document,\r\nwith a clause inserted: \"If the Athenians have any better and juster\r\nviews to propound, let them come to the Persian court and explain them.\"\r\n(40)\r\n\r\n (40) See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 402; and \"Ages.\" viii. 3.\r\n\r\nThus the ambassadors returned each to his own home and were variously\r\nreceived. Timagoras, on the indictment of Leon, who proved that his\r\nfellow-commissioner not only refused to lodge with him at the king's\r\ncourt, but in every way played into the hands of Pelopidas, was put to\r\ndeath. Of the other joint commissioners, the Eleian, Archidamus, was\r\nloud in his praises of the king and his policy, because he had shown\r\na preference to Elis over the Arcadians; while for a converse reason,\r\nbecause the Arcadian league was slighted, Antiochus not only refused to\r\naccept any gift, but brought back as his report to the general assembly\r\nof the Ten Thousand, (41) that the king appeared to have a large army of\r\nconfectioners and pastry-cooks, butlers and doorkeepers; but as for\r\nmen capable of doing battle with Hellenes, he had looked carefully, and\r\ncould not discover any. Besides all which, even the report of his wealth\r\nseemed to him, he said, bombastic nonsense. \"Why, the golden plane-tree\r\nthat is so belauded is not big enough to furnish shade to a single\r\ngrasshopper.\" (42)\r\n\r\n (41) See above, VI. v. 6; Freeman, \"Hist. Fed. Gov.\" 202; Demosth. \"F.\r\n    L.\" 220, etc.\r\n\r\n (42) Or, \"the golden plane-tree they romance about would not suffice\r\n    to,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAt Thebes a conference of the states had been convened to listen to the\r\ngreat king's letter. The Persian who bore the missive merely pointed\r\nto the royal seal, and read the document; whereupon the Thebans invited\r\nall, who wished to be their friends, to take an oath to what they had\r\njust heard, as binding on the king and on themselves. To which the\r\nambassadors from the states replied that they had been sent to listen to\r\na report, not to take oaths; if oaths were wanted, they recommended\r\nthe Thebans to send ambassadors to the several states. The Arcadian\r\nLycomedes, moreover, added that the congress ought not to be held at\r\nThebes at all, but at the seat of war, wherever that might be. This\r\nremark brought down the wrath of the Thebans on the speaker; they\r\nexclaimed that he was bent on breaking up the alliance. Whereupon the\r\nArcadian refused to take a seat in the congress at all, and got up\r\nand betook himself off there and then, accompanied by all the Arcadian\r\nenvoys. Since, therefore, the assembled representatives refused to take\r\nthe oaths at Thebes, the Thebans sent to the different states, one by\r\none in turn, urging each to undertake solemnly to act in accordance with\r\nthe great king's rescript. They were persuaded that no individual state\r\nwould venture to quarrel with themselves and the Persian monarch at\r\nonce. As a matter of fact, however, when they arrived at Corinth--which\r\nwas the first stated vist--the Corinthians stood out and gave as their\r\nanswer, that they had no desire for any common oath or undertaking with\r\nthe king. The rest of the states followed suit, giving answers of\r\na similar tenor, so that this striving after empire on the part of\r\nPelopidas and the Thebans melted like a cloud-castle into air.\r\n\r\nB.C. 367. (43) But Epaminondas was bent on one more effort. With a view\r\nto forcing the Arcadians and the rest of the allies to pay better heed\r\nto Thebes, he desired first to secure the adhesion of the Achaeans,\r\nand decided to march an army into Achaea. Accordingly, he persuaded the\r\nArgive Peisias, who was at the head of military affairs in Argos, to\r\nseize and occupy Oneion in advance. Persias, having ascertained that\r\nonly a sorry guard was maintained over Oneion by Naucles, the general\r\ncommanding the Lacedaemonian foreign brigade, and by Timomachus the\r\nAthenian, under cover of night seized and occupied with two thousand\r\nheavy infantry the rising ground above Cenchreae, taking with him\r\nprovisions for seven days. Within the interval the Thebans arrived\r\nand surmounted the pass of Oneion; whereupon the allied troops with\r\nEpaminondas at their head, advanced into Achaea. The result of the\r\ncampaign was that the better classes of Achaea gave in their adhesion\r\nto him; and on his personal authority Epaminondas insisted that there\r\nshould be no driving of the aristocrats into exile, nor any modification\r\nof the constitution. He was content to take a pledge of fealty from the\r\nAchaeans to this effect: \"Verily and indeed we will be your allies, and\r\nfollow whithersoever the Thebans lead.\" (44)\r\n\r\n (43) B.C. 367, according to Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 365, note 1; al. B.C.\r\n    366.\r\n\r\n (44) See Freeman, \"Hist. Fed. Gov.\" p. 241: \"We read of local\r\n    oligarchies (in the several cities of Achaia) which Epameinondas\r\n    found and left in possession, but which the home government of\r\n    Thebes thought good to expel, and to substitute democracies under\r\n    the protection of Theban harmosts. This policy did not answer, as\r\n    the large bodies of exiles thus formed contrived to recover the\r\n    cities, and to bring them to a far more decided Spartan\r\n    partisanship than before.\"\r\n\r\nSo he departed home. The Arcadians, however, and the partisans of the\r\nopposite faction in Thebes were ready with an indictment against him:\r\n\"Epaminondas,\" they said, \"had merely swept and garnished Achaea for the\r\nLacedaemonians, and then gone off.\" The Thebans accordingly resolved\r\nto send governors (45) into the states of Achaea; and those officers on\r\narrival joined with the commonalty and drove out the better folk,\r\nand set up democracies throughout Achaea. On their side, these exiles\r\ncoalesced, and, marching upon each separate state in turn, for they\r\nwere pretty numerous, speedily won their restoration and dominated the\r\nstates. As the party thus reinstated no longer steered a middle course,\r\nbut went heart and soul into an alliance with Lacedaemon, the Arcadians\r\nfound themselves between the upper and the nether millstone--that is to\r\nsay, the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans.\r\n\r\n (45) Lit. \"harmosts.\"\r\n\r\nAt Sicyon, hitherto, (46) the constitution was based on the ancient\r\nlaws; but at this date Euphron (who during the Lacedaemonian days had\r\nbeen the greatest man in Sicyon, and whose ambition it was to hold\r\na like pre-eminence under their opponents) addressed himself to the\r\nArgives and Arcadians as follows: \"If the wealthiest classes should ever\r\ncome into power in Sicyon, without a doubt the city would take the first\r\nopportunity of readopting a Laconian policy; whereas, if a democracy be\r\nset up,\" he added, \"you may rest assured Sicyon will hold fast by you.\r\nAll I ask you is to stand by me; I will do the rest. It is I who will\r\ncall a meeting of the people; and by that selfsame act I shall give\r\nyou a pledge of my good faith and present you with a state firm in\r\nits alliance. All this, be assured,\" he added, \"I do because, like\r\nyourselves, I have long ill brooked the pride of Lacedaemon, and shall\r\nbe glad to escape the yoke of bondage.\"\r\n\r\n (46) See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 379.\r\n\r\nThese proposals found favour with the Arcadians and the Argives,\r\nwho gladly gave the assistance demanded. Euphron straightway, in\r\nthe market-place, in the presence of the two powers concerned,\r\n(47) proceeded to convene the Demos, as if there were to be a new\r\nconstitution, based on the principle of equality. (48) When the\r\nconvention met, he bade them appoint generals: they might choose\r\nwhom they liked. Whereupon they elected Euphron himself, Hippodamus,\r\nCleander, Acrisius, and Lysander. When these matters were arranged he\r\nappointed Adeas, his own son, over the foreign brigade, in place of the\r\nformer commander, Lysimenes, whom he removed. His next step was promptly\r\nto secure the fidelity of the foreign mercenaries by various acts of\r\nkindness, and to attach others; and he spared neither the public nor the\r\nsacred moneys for this object. He had, to aid him, further, the property\r\nof all the citizens whom he exiled on the ground of Laconism, and\r\nof this without scruple he in every case availed himself. As for his\r\ncolleagues in office, some he treacherously put to death, others he\r\nexiled, by which means he got everything under his own power, and was\r\nnow a tyrant without disguise. The method by which he got the allies to\r\nconnive at his doings was twofold. Partly he worked on them by pecuniary\r\naid, partly by the readiness with which he lent the support of his\r\nforeign troops on any campaign to which they might invite him.\r\n\r\n (47) Lit. \"the Argives and the Arcadians.\"\r\n\r\n (48) Lit. \"on fair and equal terms.\" See Thuc. v. 79.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nB.C. 366. Matters had so far progressed that the Argives had already\r\nfortified the Trikaranon above the Heraion as an outpost to threaten\r\nPhlius, while the Sicyonians were engaged in fortifying Thyamia (1)\r\non their frontier; and between the two the Phliasians were severely\r\npinched. They began to suffer from dearth of necessaries; but, in\r\nspite of all, remained unshaken in their alliance. It is the habit of\r\nhistorians, I know, to record with admiration each noble achievement of\r\nthe larger powers, but to me it seems a still more worthy task to bring\r\nto light the great exploits of even a little state found faithful in the\r\nperformance of fair deeds.\r\n\r\n (1) \"Thyamia is placed by Ross on the lofty hill of Spiria, the\r\n    northern prolongation of Tricaranum, between the villages Stimanga\r\n    and Skrapani.\"--\"Dict. Anct. Geog.\" \"Phlius.\"\r\n\r\nB.C. 370-369. Now these Phliasians were friends of Lacedaemon while at\r\nthe zenith of her power. After her disaster on the field of Leuctra,\r\nwhen many of the Perioeci, and the helots to a man, revolted; when, more\r\nthan that, the allies, save only quite a few, forsook her; (2) and\r\nwhen united Hellas, so to speak, was marching on her--these Phliasians\r\nremained stanch in their allegiance; and, in spite of the hostility of\r\nthe most powerful states of the Peloponnese, to wit the Arcardians and\r\nthe Argives, they insisted on coming to her aid. It fell to their lot\r\nto cross into Prasiae as the rearguard of the reinforcements, which\r\nconsisted of the men of Corinth, of Epidaurus and of Troezen, of\r\nHermione, Halieis, and Sicyon and Pellene, in the days before any of\r\nthese had revolted. (3) Not even when the commander of the foreign\r\nbrigade, picking up the divisions already across, left them behind and\r\nwas gone--not even so did they flinch or turn back, but hired a guide\r\nfrom Prasiae, and though the enemy was massed round Amyclae, slipped\r\nthrough his ranks, as best they could, and so reached Sparta. It was\r\nthen that the Lacedaemonians, besides other honours conferred upon them,\r\nsent them an ox as a gift of hospitality.\r\n\r\n (2) See above, \"VI.\" v. 29.\r\n\r\n (3) See \"Hell.\" VII. i. 18.\r\n\r\nB.C. 369. Later on, when the enemy had retired from Laconia, the\r\nArgives, ill brooking so much zeal for Lacedaemon on the part of Phlius,\r\nmarched in full force against the little state, and fell to ravaging\r\ntheir territory. Even then they remained undaunted; and when the enemy\r\nturned to retire, destroying all that he could lay hands upon, out\r\ndashed the cavalry of the Phliasians and dogged his retreat. And\r\nnotwithstanding that the Argive's rear consisted of the whole of his\r\ncavalry, with some companies of infantry to support them, they attacked\r\nhim, sixty in number, and routed his whole rearguard. They slew, indeed,\r\nbut a few of them; but, having so slain that handful, they paused and\r\nerected a trophy in full sight of the Argive army with as little concern\r\nas if they had cut down their enemies to a man.\r\n\r\nOnce again the Lacedaemonians and their allies were guarding Oneion, (4)\r\nand the Thebans were threatening to scale the pass. The Arcadians and\r\nEleians (5) were moving forwards through Nemea to effect a junction with\r\nthe Thebans, when a hint was conveyed to them by some Phliasian exiles,\r\n\"Only show yourselves before Phlius and the town is yours.\" An agreement\r\nwas made, and in the dead of night a party consisting of the exiles\r\nthemselves and others with them, about six hundred in number, planted\r\nthemselves close under the walls with scaling-ladders. Presently the\r\nscouts from the Trikaranon signalled to the city that the enemy was\r\nadvancing. The citizens were all attention; their eyes fixed upon their\r\nscouts. Meanwhile the traitors within were likewise signalling to those\r\nseated under lee of the walls \"to scale\"; and these, scaling up, seized\r\nthe arms of the guards, which they found abandoned, and fell to pursuing\r\nthe day sentinels, ten in number (one out of each squad of five being\r\nalways left on day duty). (6) One of these was put to the sword as he\r\nlay asleep, and a second as he was escaping to the Heraion; but the\r\nother eight day-pickets leapt down the wall on the side towards the\r\ncity, one after another. The scaling party now found themselves in\r\nundisputed possession of the citadel. But the shouting had reached the\r\ncity below: the citizens rallied to the rescue; and the enemy began by\r\nsallying forth from the citadel, and did battle in the forefront of the\r\ngate leading down to the city. By and by, being strongly beleaguered\r\nby the ever-increasing reinforcements of the citizens, they retired,\r\nfalling back upon the citadel; and the citizens along with the enemy\r\nforced their way in. The centre of the citadel was speedily deserted;\r\nfor the enemy scaled the walls and towers, and showered blows and\r\nmissiles upon the citizens below. These defended themselves from the\r\nground, or pressed the encounter home by climbing the ladders which led\r\nto the walls. Once masters of certain towers on this side and the other\r\nof the invaders, the citizens came to close quarters with them with\r\nreckless desperation. The invaders, pushed and pommelled by dint of such\r\naudacity and hard hitting, were cooped up like sheep into narrower\r\nand narrower space. But at that critical moment the Arcadians and the\r\nArgives were circling round the city, and had begun to dig through the\r\nwalls of the citadel from its upper side. (7) Of the citizens inside\r\nsome were beating down their assailants on the wall; (8) others,\r\nthose of them who were climbing up from outside and were still on the\r\nscaling-ladders, whilst a third set were delivering battle against\r\nthose who had mounted the towers. These last had found fire in the\r\nmen's quarters, and were engaged in setting the towers and all ablaze,\r\nbringing up sheaves of corn and grass--an ample harvesting, as luck\r\nwould have it, garnered off the citadel itself. Thereupon the occupants\r\nof the towers, in terror of the flames, leapt down one by one, while\r\nthose on the walls, under the blows of the defenders, tumbled off with\r\nsimilar expedition; and as soon as they had once begun to yield, the\r\nwhole citadel, in almost less time than it takes to tell, was cleared of\r\nthe enemy. In an instant out dashed the cavalry, and the enemy, seeing\r\nthem, beat a hasty retreat, leaving behind scaling-ladders and dead,\r\nbesides some comrades hopelessly maimed. In fact, the enemy, what\r\nbetween those who were slain inside and those who leapt from the walls,\r\nlost not less than eighty men. And now it was a goodly sight to see the\r\nbrave men grasp one another by the hand and pledge each other on their\r\npreservation, whilst the women brought them drink and cried for joy. Not\r\none there present but in very sooth was overcome by laughter mixed with\r\ntears. (9)\r\n\r\n (4) B.C. 369? al. B.C. 368.

The reason of this perpetually-renewed attack on Phlius is\r\nnot far to seek: partly it was the result of spleen, partly the little\r\ntownship stood midway between them, and they cherished the hope that\r\nthrough want of the necessaries of life they would bring it over.\r\nDuring this invasion the cavalry and the picked troop of the Phliasians,\r\nassisted by some Athenian knights, made another famous charge at the\r\ncrossing of the river. (11) They made it so hot for the enemy that for\r\nthe rest of that day he was forced to retire under the mountain ridges,\r\nand to hold aloof as if afraid to trample down the corn-crops of a\r\nfriendly people on the flat below.\r\n\r\n (10) B.C. 368 (or 367).\r\n\r\n (11) The Asopus.\r\n\r\nAgain another time (12) the Theban commander in Sicyon marched out\r\nagainst Phlius, taking with him the garrison under his personal command,\r\nwith the Sicyonians and Pellenians (for at the date of the incident\r\nthese states followed in the wake of Thebes). Euphron was there also\r\nwith his mercenaries, about two thousand in number, to share the\r\nfortunes of the field. The mass of the troops began their descent on the\r\nHeraion by the Trikaranon, intending to ravage the flat bottom below. At\r\nthe gate leading to Corinth the Theban general left his Sicyonians and\r\nPellenians on the height, to prevent the Phliasians getting behind him\r\nat this point and so over the heads of his troops as they lay at the\r\nHeraion beneath. (13) As soon as the citizens of Phlius found that\r\nhostile troops were advancing on their corn-land, out dashed the cavalry\r\nwith the chosen band of the Phliasians and gave battle, not suffering\r\nthe enemy to penetrate into the plain. The best part of the day was\r\nspent in taking long shots at one another on that field; Euphron pushing\r\nhis attack down to the point where cavalry could operate, the citizens\r\nretaliating as far as the Heraion. Presently the time to withdraw\r\nhad come, and the enemy began to retire, following the circle of the\r\nTrikaranon; the short cut to reach the Pellenians being barred by the\r\nravine which runs in front of the walls. The Phliasians escorted their\r\nretreating foes a little way up the steep, and then turning off dashed\r\nalong the road beside the walls, making for the Pellenians and those\r\nwith them; whereupon the Theban, perceiving the haste of the Phliasians,\r\nbegan racing with his infantry to outspeed them and bring succour to the\r\nPellenians. The cavalry, however, arrived first and fell to attacking\r\nthe Pellenians, who received and withstood the shock, and the cavalry\r\ndrew back. A second time they charged, and were supported by some\r\ninfantry detachments, which had now come up. It ended in a hand-to-hand\r\nfight; and eventually the enemy gave way. On the field lay dead some\r\nSicyonians, and of the Pellenians many a good man. In record of the feat\r\nthe Phliasians began to raise a trophy, as well they might; and loud and\r\nclear the paean rang. As to the Theban and Euphron, they and all their\r\nmen stood by and stared at the proceedings, like men who had raced to\r\nsee a sight. After all was over the one party retired to Sicyon and the\r\nother withdrew into their city.\r\n\r\n (12) B.C. 367 (or 366).\r\n\r\n (13) Lit. \"above the Heraion\" (where his main body lay).\r\n\r\nThat too was another noble exploit of the Phliasians, when they took the\r\nPellenian Proxenus prisoner and, although suffering from scarcity at the\r\ntime, sent him back without a ransom. \"As generous as brave,\" such is\r\ntheir well-earned title who were capable of such performance.\r\n\r\nThe heroic resolution with which these men maintained their loyalty to\r\ntheir friends is manifest. When excluded from the fruits of their own\r\nsoil, they contrived to live, partly by helping themselves from the\r\nenemy's territory, partly by purchasing from Corinth, though to reach\r\nthat market they must run the gauntlet of a thousand risks; and having\r\nreached it their troubles began afresh. There were difficulties\r\nin providing the requisite sum, difficulties in arranging with the\r\npurveyors, and it was barely possible to find sureties for the very\r\nbeasts which should carry home their marketing. They had reached the\r\ndepth of despair, and were absolutely at a loss what to do, when they\r\narranged with Chares to escort their convoy. Once safe inside Phlius,\r\nthey begged him to help them to convey their useless and sick folk to\r\nPellene. (14) These they left at that place; and after making purchases\r\nand packing as many beasts of burthen as they could, they set off to\r\nreturn in the night, not in ignorance that they would be laid in wait\r\nfor by the enemy, but persuaded that the want of provisions was a worse\r\nevil than mere fighting.\r\n\r\n (14) What is the date of this incident? See above, \"Hell.\" VII. ii. 3;\r\n    below VII. iv. 17.\r\n\r\nThe men of Phlius pushed forward with Chares; presently they stumbled on\r\nthe enemy and at once grappled to their work. Pressing hard on the foe,\r\nthey called cheerily to one another, and shouted at the same time to\r\nChares to bring up his aid. In short, the victory was theirs; and the\r\nenemy was driven off the road; and so they got themselves and their\r\nsupplies safely home. The long night-watching superinduced sleep which\r\nlasted well into the next day. But Chares was no sooner out of bed then\r\nhe was accosted by the cavalry and the pick of the heavy infantry with\r\nthe following appeal: \"Chares, to-day you have it in your power to\r\nperform the noblest deed of arms. The Sicyonians are fortifying an\r\noutpost on our borders, they have plenty of stone-masons but a mere\r\nhandful of hoplites. We the knights of Phlius and we the flower of our\r\ninfantry force will lead the way; and you shall follow after with your\r\nmercenaries. Perhaps when you appear on the scene you will find the\r\nwhole thing finished, or perhaps your coming will send the enemy flying,\r\nas happened at Pellene. If you do not like the sound of these proposals,\r\nsacrifice and take counsel of the gods. Our belief is that the gods\r\nwill bid you yet more emphatically than we to take this step. Only this,\r\nChares, you must well consider, that if you do take it you will have\r\nestablished an outpost on the enemy's frontier; you will have saved\r\nfrom perdition a friendly city; you will win eternal glory in your own\r\nfatherland; and among friends and foes alike no name will be heralded\r\nwith louder praise than that of Chares.\"\r\n\r\nChares was persuaded, and proceeded to offer sacrifice. Meanwhile the\r\nPhliasian cavalry were donning their breastplates and bridling their\r\nhorses, and the heavy infantry made every preparation for the march.\r\nThen they took their arms, fell into line, and tramped off to the place\r\nof sacrifice. Chares with the soothsayer stepped forward to meet them,\r\nannouncing that the victims were favourable. \"Only wait for us,\" they\r\nexclaimed; \"we will sally forth with you at once.\" The heralds' cry\r\n\"To arms!\" was sounded, and with a zeal which was almost miraculous the\r\nmercenaries themselves rushed out. As soon as Chares began the march,\r\nthe Phliasian cavalry and infantry got in front of him. At first they\r\nled off at a smart pace; presently they began to bowl (15) along more\r\nquickly, and finally the cavalry were tearing over the ground might and\r\nmain, whilst the infantry, at the greatest pace compatible with keeping\r\ntheir ranks, tore after them; and behind them, again, came Chares\r\nzealously following up in their rear. There only remained a brief\r\ninterval of daylight before the sun went down, and they came upon the\r\nenemy in the fortress, some washing, some cooking a savoury meal, others\r\nkneading their bread, others making their beds. These, when they saw\r\nthe vehemence of the attack, at once, in utter panic, took to flight,\r\nleaving behind all their provisions for the brave fellows who took their\r\nplace. They, as their reward, made a fine supper off these stores and\r\nothers which had come from home, pouring out libations for their good\r\nfortune and chanting the battle-hymn; after which they posted pickets\r\nfor the night and slumbered well. The messenger with the news of their\r\nsuccess at Thyamia arrived at Corinth in the night. The citizens of that\r\nstate with hearty friendship at once ordered out by herald all the\r\noxen and beasts of burthen, which they loaded with food and brought to\r\nPhlius; and all the while the fortress was building day by day these\r\nconvoys of food were duly despatched.\r\n\r\n (15) See \"Anab.\" VII. iii. 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBut on this topic enough, perhaps, has been said to demonstrate the\r\nloyalty of the men of Phlius to their friends, their bravery in war,\r\nand, lastly, their steadfastness in maintaining their alliance in spite\r\nof famine.\r\n\r\nB.C. 367-366. It seems to have been somewhere about this date that\r\nAeneas the Stymphalian, (1) who had become general of the Arcadians,\r\nfinding that the state of affairs in Sicyon was intolerable, marched\r\nup with his army into the acropolis. Here he summoned a meeting of the\r\nSicyonian aristocrats already within the walls, and sent to fetch\r\nthose others who had been banished without a decree of the people. (2)\r\nEuphron, taking fright at these proceedings, fled for safety to the\r\nharbour-town of Sicyon. Hither he summoned Pasimelus from Corinth, and\r\nby his instrumentality handed over the harbour to the Lacedaemonians.\r\nOnce more reappearing in his old character, he began to pose as an ally\r\nof Sparta. He asserted that his fidelity to Lacedaemon had never been\r\ninterrupted; for when the votes were given in the city whether Sicyon\r\nshould give up her allegiance to Lacedaemon, \"I, with one or two\r\nothers,\" said he, \"voted against the measure; but afterwards these\r\npeople betrayed me, and in my desire to avenge myself on them I set up\r\na democracy. At present all traitors to yourselves are banished--I have\r\nseen to that. If only I could get the power into my own hands, I would\r\ngo over to you, city and all, at once. All that I can do at present,\r\nI have done; I have surrendered to you this harbour.\" That was what\r\nEuphron said to his audience there, but of the many who heard his words,\r\nhow many really believed his words is by no means evident. However,\r\nsince I have begun the story of Euphron, I desire to bring it to its\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n (1) Is this man the famous writer {o taktikos}, a portion of whose\r\n    works, the \"Treatise on Siege Operations,\" has been preserved\r\n     (recently re-edited by Arnold Hug--\"Commentarius Poliorceticus,\"\r\n    Lips. Trubner, 1884)? So Casaubon supposed. Cf. \"Com. Pol.\" 27,\r\n    where the writer mentions {paneia} as the Arcadian term for\r\n    \"panics.\" Readers of the \"Anabasis\" will recollect the tragic end\r\n    of another Aeneas, also of Stymphalus, an Arcadian officer. On the\r\n    official title {strategos} (general), Freeman (\"Hist. Fed. Gov.\"\r\n    204) notes that \"at the head of the whole League there seems to\r\n    have been, as in so many other cases, a single Federal general.\"\r\n    Cf. Diod. xv. 62.\r\n\r\n (2) See above, VII. i. 46.\r\n\r\nFaction and party strife ran high in Sicyon between the better classes\r\nand the people, when Euphron, getting a body of foreign troops from\r\nAthens, once more obtained his restoration. The city, with the help of\r\nthe commons, he was master of, but the Theban governor held the citadel.\r\nEuphron, perceiving that he would never be able to dominate the state\r\nwhilst the Thebans held the acropolis, collected money and set off to\r\nThebes, intending to persuade the Thebans to expel the aristocrats and\r\nonce again to hand over the city to himself. But the former exiles,\r\nhaving got wind of this journey of his, and of the whole intrigue, set\r\noff themselves to Thebes in front of him. (3) When, however, they\r\nsaw the terms of intimacy on which he associated with the Theban\r\nauthorities, in terror of his succeeding in his mission some of them\r\nstaked their lives on the attempt and stabbed Euphron in the Cadmeia,\r\nwhere the magistrates and senate were seated. The magistrates, indeed,\r\ncould not but indict the perpetrators of the deed before the senate, and\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"on an opposition journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens, it is our duty to arraign these murderers of Euphron,\r\nthe men before you, on the capital charge. Mankind may be said to\r\nfall into two classes: there are the wise and temperate, (4) who are\r\nincapable of any wrong and unhallowed deed; and there are the base, the\r\nbad, who do indeed such things, but try to escape the notice of their\r\nfellows. The men before you are exceptional. They have so far exceeded\r\nall the rest of men in audacity and foul villainy that, in the very\r\npresence of the magistrates and of yourselves, who alone have the power\r\nof life and death, they have taken the law into their own hands, (5) and\r\nhave slain this man. But they stand now before the bar of justice, and\r\nthey must needs pay the extreme penalty; for, if you spare them, what\r\nvisitor will have courage to approach the city? Nay, what will become\r\nof the city itself, if license is to be given to any one who chooses to\r\nmurder those who come here, before they have even explained the\r\nobject of their visit? It is our part, then, to prosecute these men as\r\narch-villains and miscreants, whose contempt for law and justice is only\r\nmatched by the supreme indifference with which they treat this city. It\r\nis your part, now that you have heard the charges, to impose upon them\r\nthat penalty which seems to be the measure of their guilt.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Lit. \"the sound of soul.\"\r\n\r\n (5) Or, \"they have been judge and jury both, and executioners to\r\n    boot.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the magistrates. Among the men thus accused, all\r\nsave one denied immediate participation in the act. It was not their\r\nhands that had dealt the blow. This one not only confessed the deed, but\r\nmade a defence in words somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As to treating you with indifference, men of Thebes, that is not\r\npossible for a man who knows that with you lies the power to deal with\r\nhim as you list. Ask rather on what I based my confidence when I slew\r\nthe man; and be well assured that, in the first place, I based it on the\r\nconviction that I was doing right; next, that your verdict will also\r\nbe right and just. I knew assuredly how you dealt with Archias (6) and\r\nHypates and that company whom you detected in conduct similar to that\r\nof Euphron: you did not stay for formal voting, but at the first\r\nopportunity within your reach you guided the sword of vengeance,\r\nbelieving that by the verdict of mankind a sentence of death had already\r\nbeen passed against the conspicuously profane person, the manifest\r\ntraitor, and him who lays to his hand to become a tyrant. See, then,\r\nwhat follows. Euphron was liable on each of these several counts: he was\r\na conspicuously profane person, who took into his keeping temples rich\r\nin votive offerings of gold and silver, and swept them bare of their\r\nsacred treasures; he was an arrant traitor--for what treason could\r\nbe more manifest than Euphron's? First he was the bosom friend of\r\nLacedaemon, but presently chose you in their stead; and, after exchange\r\nof solemn pledges between yourselves and him, once more turned round and\r\nplayed the traitor to you, and delivered up the harbour to your enemies.\r\nLastly, he was most undisguisedly a tyrant, who made not free men only,\r\nbut free fellow-citizens his slaves; who put to death, or drove into\r\nexile, or robbed of their wealth and property, not malefactors, note\r\nyou, but the mere victims of his whim and fancy; and these were ever\r\nthe better folk. Once again restored by the help of your sworn foes\r\nand antagonists, the Athenians, to his native town of Sicyon, the first\r\nthing he did was to take up arms against the governor from Thebes; but,\r\nfinding himself powerless to drive him from the acropolis, he collected\r\nmoney and betook himself hither. Now, if it were proved that he had\r\nmustered armed bands to attack you, I venture to say, you would have\r\nthanked me that I slew him. What then, when he came furnished with vile\r\nmoneys, to corrupt you therewith, to bribe you to make him once more\r\nlord and master of the state? How shall I, who dealt justice upon him,\r\njustly suffer death at your hands? For to be worsted in arms implies\r\ninjury certainly, but of the body only: the defeated man is not proved\r\nto be dishonest by his loss of victory. But he who is corrupted by\r\nfilthy lucre, contrary to the standard of what is best, (7) is at once\r\ninjured and involved in shame.\r\n\r\n (6) See above, V. iv. 2.\r\n\r\n (7) Or, as we should say, \"in violation of conscience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now if he had been your friend, however much he was my national foe,\r\nI do confess it had been scarce honourable of me to have stabbed him to\r\ndeath in your presence: but why, I should like to ask, should the man\r\nwho betrayed you be less your enemy than mine? 'Ah, but,' I hear some\r\none retort, 'he came of his own accord.' I presume, sir, you mean that\r\nhad he chanced to be slain by somebody at a distance from your state,\r\nthat somebody would have won your praise; but now, on the ground that\r\nhe came back here to work mischief on the top of mischief, 'he had the\r\nright to live'! (8) In what part of Hellas, tell me, sir, do Hellenes\r\nkeep a truce with traitors, double-dyed deserters, and tyrants?\r\nMoreover, I must remind you that you passed a resolution--if I mistake\r\nnot, it stands recorded in your parliamentary minutes--that 'renegades\r\nare liable to be apprehended (9) in any of the allied cities.' Now, here\r\nis a renegade restoring himself without any common decree of the allied\r\nstates: will any one tell me on what ground this person did not deserve\r\nto die? What I maintain, sirs, is that if you put me to death, by so\r\ndoing you will be aiding and abetting your bitterest foe; while, by\r\na verdict sanctioning the justice of my conduct, you will prove your\r\nwillingness to protect the interests not of yourselves only, but of the\r\nwhole body of your allies.\"\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"he was wrongfully slain.\"\r\n\r\n (9) For this right of extradition see Plut. \"Lys.\" xxvii.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans on hearing these pleadings decided that Euphron had only\r\nsuffered the fate which he deserved. His own countrymen, however,\r\nconveyed away the body with the honours due to a brave and good man, and\r\nburied him in the market-place, where they still pay pious reverence to\r\nhis memory as \"a founder of the state.\" So strictly, it would seem, do\r\nthe mass of mankind confine the term brave and good to those who are the\r\nbenefactors of themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nB.C. 366. And so ends the history of Euphron. I return to the point\r\nreached at the commencement of this digression. (1) The Phliasians were\r\nstill fortifying Thyamia, and Chares was still with them, when Oropus\r\n(2) was seized by the banished citizens of that place. The Athenians\r\nin consequence despatched an expedition in full force to the point of\r\ndanger, and recalled Chares from Thyamia; whereupon the Sicyonians and\r\nthe Arcadians seized the opportunity to recapture the harbour of Sicyon.\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians, forced to act single-handed, with none of their\r\nallies to assist them, retired from Oropus, leaving that town in the\r\nhands of the Thebans as a deposit till the case at issue could be\r\nformally adjudicated.\r\n\r\n (1) See above, VII. ii. 23; iii. 3; Diod. xv. 76.\r\n\r\n (2) See Thuc. viii. 60.\r\n\r\nNow Lycomedes (3) had discovered that the Athenians were harbouring a\r\ngrievance against her allies, as follows:--They felt it hard that, while\r\nAthens was put to vast trouble on their account, yet in her need not a\r\nman among them stepped forward to render help. Accordingly he persuaded\r\nthe assembly of Ten Thousand to open negotiations with Athens for the\r\npurpose of forming an alliance. (4) At first some of the Athenians were\r\nvexed that they, being friends of Lacedaemon, should become allied to\r\nher opponents; but on further reflection they discovered it was no less\r\ndesirable for the Lacedaemonians than for themselves that the Arcadians\r\nshould become independent of Thebes. That being so, they were quite\r\nready to accept an Arcadian alliance. Lycomedes himself was still\r\nengaged on this transaction when, taking his departure from Athens, he\r\ndied, in a manner which looked like divine intervention.\r\n\r\n (3) See above, VII. i. 23.\r\n\r\n (4) This proves that \"the Ten Thousand made war and peace in the name\r\n    of all Arkadia\"; cf. \"Hell.\" VII. i. 38; Diod. xv. 59. \"They\r\n    received and listened to the ambassadors of other Greek states\";\r\n    Demosth. \"F. L.\" 220. \"They regulated and paid the standing army\r\n    of the Federation\"; \"Hell.\" VII. iv. 22, 23; Diod. xv. 62. \"They\r\n    sat in judgment on political offenders against the collective\r\n    majority of the Arkadian League\"; \"Hell.\" VII. iv. 33; Freeman,\r\n    \"Hist. Fed. Gov.\" 203, note 1.\r\n\r\nOut of the many vessels at his service he had chosen the one he liked\r\nbest, and by the terms of contract was entitled to land at any point he\r\nmight desire; but for some reason, selected the exact spot where a body\r\nof Mantinean exiles lay. Thus he died; but the alliance on which he had\r\nset his heart was already consummated.\r\n\r\nNow an argument was advanced by Demotion (5) in the Assembly of Athens,\r\napproving highly of the friendship with the Arcadians, which to his\r\nmind was an excellent thing, but arguing that the generals should be\r\ninstructed to see that Corinth was kept safe for the Athenian people.\r\nThe Corinthians, hearing this, lost no time in despatching garrisons of\r\ntheir own large enough to take the place of the Athenian garrisons at\r\nany point where they might have them, with orders to these latter to\r\nretire: \"We have no further need of foreign garrisons,\" they said. The\r\ngarrisons did as they were bid.\r\n\r\n (5) Of Demotion nothing more, I think, is known. Grote (\"H. G.\" x.\r\n    397) says: \"The public debates of the Athenian assembly were not\r\n    favourable to the success of a scheme like that proposed by\r\n    Demotion, to which secrecy was indispensable. Compare another\r\n    scheme\" (the attempted surprise of Mitylene, B.C. 428), \"divulged\r\n    in like manner, in Thuc. iii. 3.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Athenian garrison troops were met together in the city\r\nof Corinth, the Corinthian authorities caused proclamation to be made\r\ninviting all Athenians who felt themselves wronged to enter their names\r\nand cases upon a list, and they would recover their dues. While things\r\nwere in this state, Chares arrived at Cenchreae with a fleet. Learning\r\nwhat had been done, he told them that he had heard there were designs\r\nagainst the state of Corinth, and had come to render assistance. The\r\nauthorities, while thanking him politely for his zeal, were not any\r\nthe more ready to admit the vessels into the harbour, but bade him sail\r\naway; and after rendering justice to the infantry troops, they sent\r\nthem away likewise. Thus the Athenians were quit of Corinth. To the\r\nArcadians, to be sure, they were forced by the terms of their alliance\r\nto send an auxiliary force of cavalry, \"in case of any foreign attack\r\nupon Arcadia.\" At the same time they were careful not to set foot on\r\nLaconian soil for the purposes of war.\r\n\r\nThe Corinthians had begun to realise on how slender a thread their\r\npolitical existence hung. They were overmastered by land still as ever,\r\nwith the further difficulty of Athenian hostility, or quasi-hostility,\r\nnow added. They resolved to collect bodies of mercenary troops, both\r\ninfantry and horse. At the head of these they were able at once to guard\r\ntheir state and to inflict much injury on their neighbouring foes. To\r\nThebes, indeed, they sent ambassadors to ascertain whether they would\r\nhave any prospect of peace if they came to seek it. The Thebans bade\r\nthem come: \"Peace they should have.\" Whereupon the Corinthians asked\r\nthat they might be allowed to visit their allies; in making peace they\r\nwould like to share it with those who cared for it, and would leave\r\nthose who preferred war to war. This course also the Thebans sanctioned;\r\nand so the Corinthians came to Lacedaemon and said:\r\n\r\n\"Men of Lacedaemon, we, your friends, are here to present a petition,\r\nand on this wise. If you can discover any safety for us whilst we\r\npersist in warlike courses, we beg that you will show it us; but if\r\nyou recognise the hopelessness of our affairs, we would, in that case,\r\nproffer this alternative: if peace is alike conducive to your interests,\r\nwe beg that you would join us in making peace, since there is no one\r\nwith whom we would more gladly share our safety than with you; if, on\r\nthe other hand, you are persuaded that war is more to your interest,\r\npermit us at any rate to make peace for ourselves. So saved to-day,\r\nperhaps we may live to help you in days to come; whereas, if to-day we\r\nbe destroyed, plainly we shall never at any time be serviceable again.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians, on hearing these proposals, counselled the\r\nCorinthians to arrange a peace on their own account; and as for the rest\r\nof their allies, they permitted any who did not care to continue the\r\nwar along with them to take a respite and recruit themselves. \"As for\r\nourselves,\" they said, \"we will go on fighting and accept whatever\r\nHeaven has in store for us,\"--adding, \"never will we submit to be\r\ndeprived of our territory of Messene, which we received as an heirloom\r\nfrom our fathers.\" (6)\r\n\r\n (6) See Isocr. \"Or.\" vi. \"Archidamos,\" S. 70; Jebb, \"Att. Or.\" ii.\r\n    193.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with this answer, the Corinthians set off to Thebes in quest\r\nof peace. The Thebans, indeed, asked them to agree on oath, not to peace\r\nonly but an alliance; to which they answered: \"An alliance meant, not\r\npeace, but merely an exchange of war. If they liked, they were ready\r\nthere and then,\" they repeated, \"to establish a just and equitable\r\npeace.\" And the Thebans, admiring the manner in which, albeit in danger,\r\nthey refused to undertake war against their benefactors, conceded to\r\nthem and the Phliasians and the rest who came with them to Thebes, peace\r\non the principle that each should hold their own territory. On these\r\nterms the oaths were taken.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Phliasians, in obedience to the compact, at once retired\r\nfrom Thyamia; but the Argives, who had taken the oath of peace on\r\nprecisely the same terms, finding that they were unable to procure the\r\ncontinuance of the Phliasian exiles in the Trikaranon as a point held\r\nwithin the limits of Argos, (7) took over and garrisoned the place,\r\nasserting now that this land was theirs--land which only a little while\r\nbefore they were ravaging as hostile territory. Further, they refused\r\nto submit the case to arbitration in answer to the challenge of the\r\nPhliasians.\r\n\r\n (7) Or, \"as a post held by them within the territory of the state.\"\r\n    The passage is perhaps corrupt.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly at the same date that the son of Dionysius (8) (his\r\nfather, Dionysius the first, being already dead) sent a reinforcement\r\nto Lacedaemon of twelve triremes under Timocrates, who on his arrival\r\nhelped the Lacedaemonians to recover Sellasia, and after that exploit\r\nsailed away home.\r\n\r\n (8) Concerning Dionysius the first, see above, VII. i. 20 foll. 28.\r\n\r\nB.C. 366-365. Not long after this the Eleians seized Lasion, (9) a\r\nplace which in old days was theirs, but at present was attached to the\r\nArcadian league. The Arcadians did not make light of the matter,\r\nbut immediately summoned their troops and rallied to the rescue.\r\nCounter-reliefs came also on the side of Elis--their Three Hundred, and\r\nagain their Four Hundred. (10) The Eleians lay encamped during the day\r\nface to face with the invader, but on a somewhat more level position.\r\nThe Arcadians were thereby induced under cover of night to mount on to\r\nthe summit of the hill overhanging the Eleians, and at day-dawn they\r\nbegan their descent upon the enemy. The Eleians soon caught sight of\r\nthe enemy advancing from the vantage ground above them, many times\r\ntheir number; but a sense of shame forbade retreat at such a distance.\r\nPresently they came to close quarters; there was a hand-to-hand\r\nencounter; the Eleians turned and fled; and in retiring down the\r\ndifficult ground lost many men and many arms.\r\n\r\n (9) See above, VII. i. 26; Freeman, \"Hist. Fed. Gov.\" p. 201.\r\n\r\n (10) From the sequel it would appear that the former were a picked\r\n    corps of infantry and the latter of cavalry. See Thuc. ii. 25;\r\n    Busolt, op. cit. p. 175 foll.\r\n\r\nFlushed with this achievement the Arcadians began marching on the cities\r\nof the Acroreia, (11) which, with the exception of Thraustus, they\r\ncaptured, and so reached Olympia. There they made an entrenched camp on\r\nthe hill of Kronos, established a garrison, and held control over the\r\nOlympian hill-country. Margana also, by help of a party inside who gave\r\nit up, next fell into their hands.\r\n\r\n (11) The mountainous district of Elis on the borders of Arcadia,  in\r\n    which the rivers Peneius and Ladon take their rise; see \"Dict. of\r\n    Anct. Geog.\" s.v.; above, III. ii. 30, IV. ii. 16. Thraustus was\r\n    one of the four chief townships of the district. For Margana, see\r\n    above, III. ii. 25, 30, IV. ii. 16, VI. v. 2.\r\n\r\nThese successive advantages gained by their opponents reacted on the\r\nEleians, and threw them altogether into despair. Meanwhile the Arcadians\r\nwere steadily advancing upon their capital. (12) At length they arrived,\r\nand penetrated into the market-place. Here, however, the cavalry and the\r\nrest of the Eleians made a stand, drove the enemy out with some loss,\r\nand set up a trophy.\r\n\r\n (12) I.e. Elis.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that the city of Elis had previously been in a\r\nstate of disruption. The party of Charopus, Thrasonidas and Argeius\r\nwere for converting the state into a democracy; the party of Eualcas,\r\nHippias, and Stratolas (13) were for oligarchy. When the Arcadians,\r\nbacked by a large force, appeared as allies of those who favoured a\r\ndemocratic constitution, the party of Charopus were at once emboldened;\r\nand, having obtained the promise of assistance from the Arcadians,\r\nthey seized the acropolis. The Knights and the Three Hundred did not\r\nhesitate, but at once marched up and dislodged them; with the result\r\nthat about four hundred citizens, with Argeius and Charopus, were\r\nbanished. Not long afterwards these exiles, with the help of some\r\nArcadians, seized and occupied Pylus; (14) where many of the commons\r\nwithdrew from the capital to join them, attracted not only by the beauty\r\nof the position, but by the great power of the Arcadians, in alliance\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n (13) See below, VII. iv. 31; Busolt, op. cit. p. 175.\r\n\r\n (14) Pylus, a town in \"hollow\" Elis, upon the mountain road from Elis\r\n    to Olympia, at the place where the Ladon flows into the Peneius\r\n    (Paus. VI. xxii. 5), near the modern village of Agrapidokhori.--\r\n    Baedeker, \"Greece,\" p. 320. See Busolt, p. 179.\r\n\r\nThere was subsequently another invasion of the territory of the Eleians\r\non the part of the Arcadians, who were influenced by the representations\r\nof the exiles that the city would come over to them. But the attempt\r\nproved abortive. The Achaeans, who had now become friends with the\r\nEleians, kept firm guard on the capital, so that the Arcadians had\r\nto retire without further exploit than that of ravaging the country.\r\nImmediately, however, on marching out of Eleian territory they were\r\ninformed that the men of Pellene were in Elis; whereupon they executed\r\na marvellously long night march and seized the Pellenian township of\r\nOlurus (15) (the Pellenians at the date in question having already\r\nreverted to their old alliance with Lacedaemon). And now the men of\r\nPellene, in their turn getting wind of what had happened at Olurus,\r\nmade their way round as best they could, and got into their own city of\r\nPellene; after which there was nothing for it but to carry on war with\r\nthe Arcadians in Olurus and the whole body of their own commons; and in\r\nspite of their small numbers they did not cease till they had reduced\r\nOlurus by siege.\r\n\r\n (15) This fortress (placed by Leake at modern Xylokastro) lay at the\r\n    entrance of the gorge of the Sys, leading from the Aigialos or\r\n    coast-land into the territory of Pellene, which itself lay about\r\n    sixty stades from the sea at modern Zougra. For the part played by\r\n    Pellene as one of the twelve Achaean states at this period, see\r\n    above.\r\n\r\nB.C. 365. (16) The Arcadians were presently engaged on another campaign\r\nagainst Elis. While they were encamped between Cyllene (17) and the\r\ncapital the Eleians attacked them, but the Arcadians made a stand\r\nand won the battle. Andromachus, the Eleian cavalry general, who was\r\nregarded as responsible for the engagement, made an end of himself;\r\nand the rest withdrew into the city. This battle cost the life also\r\nof another there present--the Spartan Socleides; since, it will be\r\nunderstood, the Lacedaemonians had by this time become allies of the\r\nEleians. Consequently the Eleians, being sore pressed on their own\r\nterritory, sent an embassy and begged the Lacedaemonians to organise an\r\nexpedition against the Arcadians. They were persuaded that in this way\r\nthey would best arrest the progress of the Arcadians, who would thus\r\nbe placed between the two foes. In accordance with this suggestion\r\nArchidamus marched out with a body of the city troops and seized\r\nCromnus. (18) Here he left a garrison--three out of the twelve regiments\r\n(19)--and so withdrew homewards. The Arcadians had just ended their\r\nEleian campaign, and, without disbanding their levies, hastened to the\r\nrescue, surrounded Cromnus with a double line of trenches, and having\r\nso secured their position, proceeded to lay siege to those inside the\r\nplace. The city of Lacedaemon, annoyed at the siege of their citizens,\r\nsent out an army, again under Archidamus, who, when he had come, set\r\nabout ravaging Arcadia to the best of his power, as also the Sciritid,\r\nand did all he could to draw off, if possible, the besieging army. The\r\nArcadians, for all that, were not one whit the more to be stirred: they\r\nseemed callous to all his proceedings.\r\n\r\n (16) See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 429 foll.; al. B.C. 364.\r\n\r\n (17) The port town of Elis.\r\n\r\n (18) Cromnus, a township near Megalopolis. See Callisthenes, ap.\r\n    Athen. 10, p. 452 A. See Schneider's note ad loc.\r\n\r\n (19) Lit. \"lochi.\" See Arnold's note to Thuc. v. 68; below, VII. v.\r\n    10.\r\n\r\nPresently espying a certain rising ground, across which the Arcadians\r\nhad drawn their outer line of circumvallation, Archidamus proposed\r\nto himself to take it. If he were once in command of that knoll, the\r\nbesiegers at its foot would be forced to retire. Accordingly he set\r\nabout leading a body of troops round to the point in question, and\r\nduring this movement the light infantry in advance of Archidamus,\r\nadvancing at the double, caught sight of the Arcadian Eparitoi (20)\r\noutside the stockade and attacked them, while the cavalry made an\r\nattempt to enforce their attack simultaneously. The Arcadians did not\r\nswerve: in compact order they waited impassively. The Lacedaemonians\r\ncharged a second time: a second time they swerved not, but on the\r\ncontrary began advancing. Then, as the hoarse roar and shouting\r\ndeepened, Archidamus himself advanced in support of his troops. To do\r\nso he turned aside along the carriage-road leading to Cromnus, and moved\r\nonward in column two abreast, (21) which was his natural order. When\r\nthey came into close proximity to one another--Archidamus's troops in\r\ncolumn, seeing they were marching along a road; the Arcadians in compact\r\norder with shields interlinked--at this conjuncture the Lacedaemonians\r\nwere not able to hold out for any length of time against the numbers of\r\nthe Arcadians. Before long Archidamus had received a wound which pierced\r\nthrough his thigh, whilst death was busy with those who fought in\r\nfront of him, Polyaenidas and Chilon, who was wedded to the sister of\r\nArchidamus, included. The whole of these, numbering no less than thirty,\r\nperished in this action. Presently, falling back along the road,\r\nthey emerged into the open ground, and now with a sense of relief the\r\nLacedaemonians got themselves into battle order, facing the foe. The\r\nArcadians, without altering their position, stood in compact line, and\r\nthough falling short in actual numbers, were in far better heart--the\r\nmoral result of an attack on a retreating enemy and the severe loss\r\ninflicted on him. The Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, were sorely\r\ndown-hearted: Archidamus lay wounded before their eyes; in their ears\r\nrang the names of those who had died, the fallen being not only brave\r\nmen, but, one may say, the flower of Spartan chivalry. The two armies\r\nwere now close together, when one of the older men lifted up his voice\r\nand cried: \"Why need we fight, sirs? Why not rather make truce and part\r\nfriends?\" Joyously the words fell on the ears of either host, and they\r\nmade a truce. The Lacedaemonians picked up their dead and retired; the\r\nArcadians withdrew to the point where their advance originally began,\r\nand set up a trophy of victory.\r\n\r\n (20) So the troops of the Arcadian Federation were named. Diodorus\r\n    (xv. 62) calls them \"the select troops,\" {tous kaloumenous\r\n    epilektous}.\r\n\r\n (21) See above, III. i. 22.\r\n\r\nNow, as the Arcadians lay at Cromnus, the Eleians from the capital,\r\nadvancing in the first instance upon Pylus, fell in with the men of that\r\nplace, who had been beaten back from Thalamae. (22) Galloping along the\r\nroad, the cavalry of the Eleians, when they caught sight of them, did\r\nnot hesitate, but dashed at them at once, and put some to the sword,\r\nwhile others of them fled for safety to a rising knoll. Ere long the\r\nEleian infantry arrived, and succeeded in dislodging this remnant on the\r\nhillock also; some they slew, and others, nearly two hundred in number,\r\nthey took alive, all of whom where either sold, if foreigners, or, if\r\nEleian exiles, put to death. After this the Eleians captured the men\r\nof Pylus and the place itself, as no one came to their rescue, and\r\nrecovered the Marganians.\r\n\r\n (22) A strong fortress in an unfrequented situation, defended by\r\n    narrow passes (Leake, \"Morea,\" ii. 204); it lay probably in the\r\n    rocky recesses of Mount Scollis (modern Santameri), on the\r\n    frontier of Achaea, near the modern village of Santameri. See\r\n    Polyb. iv. 75. See Busolt, op. cit. p. 179.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians presently made a second attempt on Cromnus by a night\r\nattack, got possession of the part of the palisading facing the Argives,\r\nand at once began summoning their besieged fellow-citizens to come out.\r\nOut accordingly came all who happened to be within easy distance, and\r\nwho took time by the forelock. The rest were not quick enough; a strong\r\nArcadian reinforcement cut them off, and they remained shut up inside,\r\nand were eventually taken prisoners and distributed. One portion of\r\nthem fell to the lot of the Argives, one to the Thebans, (23) one to the\r\nArcadians, and one to the Messenians. The whole number taken, whether\r\ntrue-born Spartans or Perioeci, amounted to more than one hundred.\r\n\r\n (23) \"The Thebans must have been soldiers in garrison at Tegea,\r\n    Megalopolis, or Messene.\"--Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 433.\r\n\r\nB.C. 364. And now that the Arcadians had leisure on the side of Cromnus,\r\nthey were again able to occupy themselves with the Eleians, and to\r\nkeep Olympia still more strongly garrisoned. In anticipation of the\r\napproaching Olympic year, (24) they began preparations to celebrate the\r\nOlympian games in conjunction with the men of Pisa, who claim to be\r\nthe original presidents of the Temple. (25) Now, when the month of the\r\nOlympic Festival--and not the month only, but the very days, during\r\nwhich the solemn assembly is wont to meet, were come, the Eleians, in\r\npursuance of preparations and invitations to the Achaeans, of which they\r\nmade no secret, at length proceeded to march along the road to Olympia.\r\nThe Arcadians had never imagined that they would really attack them; and\r\nthey were themselves just now engaged with the men of Pisa in carrying\r\nout the details of the solemn assembly. They had already completed the\r\nchariot-race, and the foot-race of the pentathlon. (26) The competitors\r\nentitled to enter for the wrestling match had left the racecourse, and\r\nwere getting through their bouts in the space between the racecourse and\r\nthe great altar.\r\n\r\n (24) I.e. \"Ol. 104. 1\" (July B.C. 364).\r\n\r\n (25) For this claim on the part of the Pisatans (as the old\r\n    inhabitants), see above, III. ii. 31; Paus. VI. xxii. 2; Diod. xv.\r\n    78; Busolt, op. cit. p. 154.\r\n\r\n (26) As to the pentathlon, see above, IV. vii. 5. Whether the\r\n    preceding {ippodromia} was, at this date, a horse or chariot race,\r\n    or both, I am unable to say.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the Eleians under arms were already close at\r\nhand within the sacred enclosure. (27) The Arcadians, without advancing\r\nfarther to meet them, drew up their troops on the river Cladaus, which\r\nflows past the Altis and discharges itself into the Alpheus. Their\r\nallies, consisting of two hundred Argive hoplites and about four hundred\r\nAthenian cavalry, were there to support them. Presently the Eleians\r\nformed into line on the opposite side of the stream, and, having\r\nsacrificed, at once began advancing. Though heretofore in matters of\r\nwar despised by Arcadians and Argives, by Achaeans and Athenians alike,\r\nstill on this day they led the van of the allied force like the bravest\r\nof the brave. Coming into collision with the Arcadians first, they at\r\nonce put them to flight, and next receiving the attack of the Argive\r\nsupports, mastered these also. Then having pursued them into the space\r\nbetween the senate-house, the temple of Hestia, and the theatre thereto\r\nadjoining, they still kept up the fighting as fiercely as ever, pushing\r\nthe retreating foe towards the great altar. But now being exposed to\r\nmissiles from the porticoes and the senate-house and the great temple,\r\n(28) while battling with their opponents on the level, some of the\r\nEleians were slain, and amongst others the commander of the Three\r\nHundred himself, Stratolas. At this state of the proceedings they\r\nretired to their camp.\r\n\r\n (27) \"The {temenos} must here be distinguished from the Altis, as\r\n    meaning the entire breadth of consecrated ground at Olympia, of\r\n    which the Altis formed a smaller interior portion enclosed with a\r\n    wall. The Eleians entered into a {temenos} before they crossed the\r\n    river Kladeus, which flowed through the {temenos}, but alongside\r\n    the Altis. The tomb of Oenomaus, which was doubtless included in\r\n    the {temenos}, was on the right bank of the Kladeus (Paus. VI.\r\n    xxi. 3); while the Altis was on the left bank of the river.\"--\r\n    Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 438, note 1. For the position of the Altis\r\n    (Paus. V. x. 1) and several of the buildings here mentioned, and\r\n    the topography of Olympia in general, see Baedeker's \"Greece,\" p.\r\n    322 foll.; and Dorpfeld's Plan (\"Olympia und Umgegend,\" Berlin,\r\n    1882), there reproduced.\r\n\r\n (28) Or, \"from the porticoes of the senate-house and the great\r\n    temple.\"\r\n\r\nThe Arcadians and those with them were so terrified at the thought of\r\nthe coming day that they gave themselves neither respite nor repose\r\nthat night, but fell to chopping up the carefully-compacted booths and\r\nconstructing them into palisades; so that when the Eleians did again\r\nadvance the next day and saw the strength of the barriers and the number\r\nmounted on the temples, they withdrew to their city. They had proved\r\nthemselves to be warriors of such mettle as a god indeed by the breath\r\nof his spirit may raise up and bring to perfection in a single day, but\r\ninto which it were impossible for mortal men to convert a coward even in\r\na lifetime.\r\n\r\nB.C. 363. The employment of the sacred treasures of the temple by the\r\nArcadian magistrates (29) as a means of maintaining the Eparitoi (30)\r\naroused protest. The Mantineans were the first to pass a resolution\r\nforbidding such use of the sacred property. They set the example\r\nthemselves of providing the necessary quota for the Troop in question\r\nfrom their state exchequer, and this sum they sent to the federal\r\ngovernment. The latter, affirming that the Mantineans were undermining\r\nthe Arcadian league, retaliated by citing their leading statesmen to\r\nappear before the assembly of Ten Thousand; and on their refusal to\r\nobey the summons, passed sentence upon them, and sent the Eparitoi to\r\napprehend them as convicted persons. The Mantineans, however, closed\r\ntheir gates, and would not admit the Troop within their walls. Their\r\nexample was speedily followed: others among the Ten Thousand began to\r\nprotest against the enormity of so applying the sacred treasures; it\r\nwas doubly wrong to leave as a perpetual heirloom to their children the\r\nimputation of a crime so heinous against the gods. But no sooner was a\r\nresolution passed in the general assembly (31) forbidding the use of the\r\nsacred moneys for profane purposes than those (members of the league)\r\nwho could not have afforded to serve as Eparitoi without pay began\r\nspeedily to melt away; while those of more independent means, with\r\nmutual encouragement, began to enrol themselves in the ranks of the\r\nEparitoi--the feeling being that they ought not to be a mere tool in\r\nthe hands of the corps, but rather that the corps itself should be their\r\ninstrument. Those members of the government who had manipulated the\r\nsacred money soon saw that when they came to render an account of\r\ntheir stewardship, in all likelihood they would lose their heads. They\r\ntherefore sent an embassy to Thebes, with instructions to the Theban\r\nauthorities warning them that, if they did not open a campaign, the\r\nArcadians would in all probability again veer round to Lacedaemon.\r\n\r\n (29) See above, VII. i. 24. \"Were these magistrates, or merely popular\r\n    leaders?\"--Freeman, \"Hist. Fed. Gov.\" p. 203, note 3.\r\n\r\n (30) Or, \"Select Troop.\" See above.\r\n\r\n (31) \"The common formula for a Greek confederation, {to koinon ton\r\n    'Arkadon}, is used as an equivalent of {oi mupioi}\" (here and\r\n    below, SS. 35, 38)--Freeman, op. cit. 202, note 4.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans, therefore, began making preparations for opening a\r\ncampaign, but the party who consulted the best interests of Peloponnese\r\n(32) persuaded the general assembly of the Arcadians to send an embassy\r\nand tell the Thebans not to advance with an army into Arcadia, unless\r\nthey sent for them; and whilst this was the language they addressed to\r\nThebes, they reasoned among themselves that they could dispense with war\r\naltogether. The presidency over the temple of Zeus, they were persuaded,\r\nthey might easily dispense with; indeed, it would at once be a more\r\nupright and a holier proceeding on their parts to give it back, and with\r\nsuch conduct the god, they thought, might be better pleased. As these\r\nwere also the views and wishes of the Eleians, both parties agreed to\r\nmake peace, and a truce was established.\r\n\r\n (32) See below, VII. v. 1, {oi kedouenoi tes Peloponnesou}. I regard\r\n    these phrases as self-laudatory political catchwords.\r\n\r\nB.C. 362. The oaths were ratified; and amongst those who swore to them\r\nwere included not only the parties immediately concerned, but the men of\r\nTegea, and the Theban general himself, who was inside Tegea with three\r\nhundred heavy infantry of the Boeotians. Under these circumstances the\r\nArcadians in Tegea remained behind feasting and keeping holy day,\r\nwith outpouring of libations and songs of victory, to celebrate the\r\nestablishment of peace. Here was an opportunity for the Theban and\r\nthose of the government who regarded the forthcoming inquiry with\r\napprehension. Aided by the Boeotians and those of the Eparitoi who\r\nshared their sentiments, they first closed the gates of the fortress of\r\nTegea, and then set about sending to the various quarters to apprehend\r\nthose of the better class. But, inasmuch as there were Arcadians present\r\nfrom all the cities, and there was a general desire for peace, those\r\napprehended must needs be many. So much so, that the prison-house was\r\neventually full to overflowing, and the town-hall was full also. Besides\r\nthe number lodged in prison, a number had escaped by leaping down the\r\nwalls, and there were others who were suffered to pass through the\r\ngates (a laxity easily explained, since no one, excepting those who were\r\nanticipating their own downfall, cherished any wrathful feeling against\r\nanybody). But what was a source of still graver perplexity to the Theban\r\ncommander and those acting with him--of the Mantineans, the very people\r\nwhom they had set their hearts on catching, they had got but very few.\r\nNearly all of them, owing to the proximity of their city, had, in fact,\r\nbetaken themselves home. Now, when day came and the Mantineans learned\r\nwhat had happened, they immediately sent and forewarned the other\r\nArcadian states to be ready in arms, and to guard the passes; and they\r\nset the example themselves by so doing. They sent at the same time to\r\nTegea and demanded the release of all Mantineans there detained. With\r\nregard to the rest of the Arcadians they further claimed that no one\r\nshould be imprisoned or put to death without trial. If any one had any\r\naccusation to bring against any, than by the mouth of their messengers\r\nthere present they gave notice that the state of Mantinea was ready to\r\noffer bail, \"Verily and indeed to produce before the general assembly\r\nof the Arcadians all who might be summoned into court.\" The Theban\r\naccordingly, on hearing this, was at a loss what to make of the affair,\r\nand released his prisoners. Next day, summoning a congress of all the\r\nArcadians who chose to come, he explained, with some show of apology,\r\nthat he had been altogether deceived; he had heard, he said, that \"the\r\nLacedaemonians were under arms on the frontier, and that some of the\r\nArcadians were about to betray Tegea into their hands.\" His auditors\r\nacquitted him for the moment, albeit they knew that as touching\r\nthemselves he was lying. They sent, however, an embassy to Thebes and\r\nthere accused him as deserving of death. Epaminondas (who was at that\r\ntime the general at the head of the war department) is reported to have\r\nmaintained that the Theban commander had acted far more rightly when he\r\nseized than when he let go the prisoners. \"Thanks to you,\" he argued,\r\n\"we have been brought into a state of war, and then you, without our\r\nadvice or opinion asked, make peace on your own account; would it not\r\nbe reasonable to retort upon you the charge of treason in such conduct?\r\nAnyhow, be assured,\" he added, \"we shall bring an army into Arcadia,\r\nand along with those who share our views carry on the war which we have\r\nundertaken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nB.C. 362. This answer was duly reported to the general assembly of the\r\nArcadians, and throughout the several states of the league. Consequently\r\nthe Mantineans, along with those of the Arcadians who had the interests\r\nof Peloponnesus at heart, as also the Eleians and the Achaeans, came\r\nto the conclusion that the policy of the Thebans was plain. They wished\r\nPeloponnesus to be reduced to such an extremity of weakness that it\r\nmight fall an easy prey into their hands who were minded to enslave it.\r\n\"Why else,\" they asked, \"should they wish us to fight, except that we\r\nmay tear each other to pieces, and both sides be driven to look to them\r\nfor support? or why, when we tell them that we have no need of them at\r\npresent, do they insist on preparing for a foreign campaign? Is it not\r\nplain that these preparations are for an expedition which will do us\r\nsome mischief?\"\r\n\r\nIn this mood they sent to Athens, (1) calling on the Athenians for\r\nmilitary aid. Ambassadors also went to Lacedaemon on behalf of the\r\nEparitoi, summoning the Lacedaemonians, if they wished to give a helping\r\nhand, to put a stop to the proceedings of any power approaching\r\nto enslave Peloponnesus. As regards the headship, they came to an\r\narrangement at once, on the principle that each of the allied states\r\nshould exercise the generalship within its own territory.\r\n\r\n (1) For a treaty of alliance between Athens, the Arkadians, Achaeans,\r\n    Eleians, and Phliasians, immediately before Mantinea, B.C. 362,\r\n    {epi Molonos arkhontos}, see Hicks, 94; Kohler, \"C. I. A.\" ii. p.\r\n    405. It is preserved on a stele (\"broken at bottom; but the top is\r\n    surmounted by a relief representing Zeus enthroned, with a\r\n    thunderbolt; a female figure  (= the {Summakhia}?) approaches\r\n    lifting her veil, while Athena stands by\") now standing among the\r\n    sculptures from the Asklepieion on the Acropolis at Athens. See\r\n    Milchhofer, p. 47, no. 7, \"Die Museum,\" Athens, 1881. For the\r\n    date, see Demosth. \"c. Polycl.\" 1207.\r\n\r\nWhile these matters were in progress, Epaminondas was prosecuting his\r\nmarch at the head of all the Boeotians, with the Euboeans, and a\r\nlarge body of Thessalians, furnished both by Alexander (2) and by his\r\nopponents. The Phocians were not represented. Their special agreement\r\nonly required them to render assistance in case of an attack on Thebes;\r\nto assist in a hostile expedition against others was not in the bond.\r\nEpaminondas, however, reflected that inside Peloponnesus itself they\r\nmight count upon the Argives and the Messenians, with that section of\r\nthe Arcadians which shared their views. These latter were the men of\r\nTegea and Megalopolis, of Asea and Pallantium, with any townships which\r\nowing to their small size or their position in the midst of these larger\r\ncities were forced to follow their lead.\r\n\r\n (2) For Alexander of Pherae, see above, VI. iv. 34. In B.C. 363 the\r\n    Thebans had sent an army under Pelopidas into Thessaly to assist\r\n    their allies among the Thessalians with the Phthiot Achaeans and\r\n    the Magnetes against Alexander. At Kynos Kephelae Alexander was\r\n    defeated, but Pelopidas was slain (see Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 420\r\n    foll.). \"His death, as it brought grief, so likewise it produced\r\n    advantage to the allies; for the Thebans, as soon as they heard of\r\n    his fall, delayed not their revenge, but presently sent seven\r\n    thousand foot and seven hundred horse, under the command of\r\n    Malcitas and Diogiton. And they, finding Alexander weak and\r\n    without forces, compelled him to restore the cities he had taken,\r\n    to withdraw his garrisons from the Magnesians and Achaeans of\r\n    Phthiotos and swear to assist the Thebans against whatsoever\r\n    enemies they should require.\"--Plut. \"Pelop.\" 35 (Clough, ii.\r\n    236).\r\n\r\nEpaminondas advanced with rapid strides; but on reaching Nemea he\r\nslackened speed, hoping to catch the Athenians as they passed,\r\nand reflecting on the magnitude of such an achievement, whether in\r\nstimulating the courage of his own allies, or in plunging his foes into\r\ndespondency; since, to state the matter concisely, any blow to Athens\r\nwould be a gain to Thebes. But during his pause at Nemea those who\r\nshared the opposite policy had time to converge on Mantinea. Presently\r\nthe news reached Epaminondas that the Athenians had abandoned the idea\r\nof marching by land, and were preparing to bring their supports to\r\nArcadia by sea through Lacedaemon. This being so, he abandoned his base\r\nof Nemea and pushed on to Tegea.\r\n\r\nThat the strategy of the Theban general was fortunate I will not pretend\r\nto assert, but in the particular combination of prudence and daring\r\nwhich stamps these exploits, I look upon him as consummate. In the first\r\nplace, I cannot but admire the sagacity which led him to form his camp\r\nwithin the walls of Tegea, where he was in greater security that he\r\nwould have been if entrenched outside, and where his future movements\r\nwere more completely concealed from the enemy. Again, the means to\r\ncollect material and furnish himself with other necessaries were readier\r\nto his hand inside the city; while, thirdly, he was able to keep an eye\r\non the movements of his opponents marching outside, and to watch their\r\nsuccessful dispositions as well as their mistakes. More than this: in\r\nspite of his sense of superiority to his antagonists, over and over\r\nagain, when he saw them gaining some advantage in position, he refused\r\nto be drawn out to attack them. It was only when he saw plainly that no\r\ncity was going to give him its adhesion, and that time was slipping by,\r\nthat he made up his mind that a blow must be struck, failing which, he\r\nhad nothing to expect save a vast ingloriousness, in place of his former\r\nfame. (3) He had ascertained that his antagonists held a strong position\r\nround Mantinea, and that they had sent to fetch Agesilaus and the whole\r\nLacedaemonian army. He was further aware that Agesilaus had commenced\r\nhis advance and was already at Pellene. (4) Accordingly he passed\r\nthe word of command (5) to his troops to take their evening meal, put\r\nhimself at their head and advanced straight upon Sparta. Had it not been\r\nfor the arrival (by some providential chance) of a Cretan, who brought\r\nthe news to Agesilaus of the enemy's advance, he would have captured\r\nthe city of Sparta like a nest of young birds absolutely bereft of its\r\nnatural defenders. As it was, Agesilaus, being forewarned, had time to\r\nreturn to the city before the Thebans came, and here the Spartans made\r\ndistribution of their scanty force and maintained watch and ward, albeit\r\nfew enough in numbers, since the whole of their cavalry were away in\r\nArcadia, and so was their foreign brigade, and so were three out of\r\ntheir twelve regiments. (6)\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"dull obscurity in place of renown.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Pellene (or Pellana), a town of Laconia on the Eurotas, and on the\r\n    road from Sparta to Arcadia; in fact the frontier fortress on the\r\n    Eurotas, as Sellasia on the Oenus; \"Dict. of Anct. Geog.\" s.v.;\r\n    see Paus. iii. 20, S. 2; Strab. viii. 386; Polyb. iv. 81, xvi. 37;\r\n    Plut. \"Agis,\" 8; Leake, \"Morea,\" iii. 14 foll.\r\n\r\n (5) Cf. \"Hipparch.\" iv. 9.\r\n\r\n (6) Lit. \"lochi.\" See above, VII. iv. 20; \"Pol. Lac.\" xi. 4.\r\n\r\nArrived within the city of Sparta, (7) Epaminondas abstained from\r\ngaining an entry at a point where his troops would have to fight on\r\nlevel ground and under attack from the houses above; where also their\r\nlarge numbers would give them no superiority over the small numbers of\r\nthe foemen. But, singling out a position which he conceived would give\r\nhim the advantage, he occupied it and began his advance against the city\r\nupon a downward instead of an upward incline.\r\n\r\n (7) Grote (\"H. G.\" x. 455) says: \"Though he crossed the Eurotas and\r\n    actually entered into the city of Sparta,\" as the words {epei de\r\n    egeneto en te polei ton Spartiaton} certainly seem to me to imply.\r\n    Others interpret \"in the close neighbourhood of.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to what subsequently took place, two possible explanations\r\nsuggest themselves: either it was miraculous, or it may be maintained\r\nthat there is no resisting the fury of desperation. Archidamus,\r\nadvancing at the head of but a hundred men, and crossing the one thing\r\nwhich might have been expected to form an obstacle to the enemy, (8)\r\nbegan marching uphill against his antagonists. At this crisis these\r\nfire-breathing warriors, these victorious heroes of Leuctra, (9) with\r\ntheir superiority at every point, aided, moreover, by the advantage of\r\ntheir position, did not withstand the attack of Archidamus and those\r\nwith him, but swerved in flight.\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"to serve as his defence\"; or, \"the one obstacle to his\r\n    progress,\" i.e. Archidamus's. It was a miraculous thing that the\r\n    Thebans did not stop him.\r\n\r\n (9) See Mahaffy, \"Hist. Gk. Lit.\" vol. ii. p. 268, 1st ed. See above,\r\n    \"Hell.\" VI. iv. 24; Diod. xv. 39, 56.\r\n\r\nThe vanguard of Epaminondas's troops were cut down; when, however,\r\nflushed with the glory of their victory, the citizens followed up their\r\npursuit beyond the right point, they in turn were cut down--so plainly\r\nwas the demarking line of victory drawn by the finger of God. So then\r\nArchidamus set up a trophy to note the limit of his success, and gave\r\nback those who had there fallen of the enemy under a truce. Epaminondas,\r\non his side, reflecting that the Arcadians must already be hastening\r\nto the relief of Lacedaemon, and being unwilling to engage them in\r\nconjunction with the whole of the Lacedaemonian force, especially now\r\nthat the star of Sparta's fortune shone, whilst theirs had suffered some\r\neclipse, turned and marched back the way he came with all speed possible\r\ninto Tegea. There he gave his heavy infantry pause and refreshment, but\r\nhis cavalry he sent on to Mantinea; he begged them to \"have courage and\r\nhold on,\" instructing them that in all likelihood they would find the\r\nflocks and herds of the Mantineans and the entire population itself\r\noutside their walls, especially as it was the moment for carrying the\r\ncorn. So they set off.\r\n\r\nThe Athenian cavalry, started from Eleusis, had made their evening\r\nmeal at the Isthmus, and passing through Cleonae, as chance befell, had\r\narrived at Mantinea and had encamped within the walls in the houses. As\r\nsoon as the enemy were seen galloping up with evidently hostile intent,\r\nthe Mantineans fell to praying the Athenian knights to lend them all the\r\nsuccour they could, and they showed them all their cattle outside, and\r\nall their labourers, and among them were many children and graybeards\r\nwho were free-born citizens. The Athenians were touched by this appeal,\r\nand, though they had not yet broken fast, neither the men themselves\r\nnor their horses, went out eagerly to the rescue. And here we must needs\r\npause to admire the valour of these men also. The enemy whom they had\r\nto cope with far outnumbered them, as was plain to see, and the former\r\nmisadventure of the cavalry in Corinth was not forgotten. (10) But none\r\nof these things entered into their calculations now--nor yet the fact\r\nthat they were on the point of engaging Thebans and Thessalians, the\r\nfinest cavalry in the world by all repute. The only thing they thought\r\nof was the shame and the dishonour, if, being there, they did not lend a\r\nhelping hand to their allies. In this mood, so soon as they caught sight\r\nof the enemy, they fell with a crash upon him in passionate longing to\r\nrecover the old ancestral glory. Nor did they fight in vain--the\r\nblows they struck enabled the Mantineans to recover all their property\r\noutside, but among those who dealt them died some brave heroes; (11)\r\nbrave heroes also, it is evident, were those whom they slew, since on\r\neither side the weapons wielded were not so short but that they could\r\nlunge at one another with effect. The dead bodies of their own men they\r\nrefused to abandon; and there were some of the enemy's slain whom they\r\nrestored to him under a flag of truce.\r\n\r\n (10) Or, \"and in Corinth an untoward incident had been experienced by\r\n    the cavalry.\" See Grote, \"H. G.\" x. 458, note 2. Possibly in\r\n    reference to \"Hell.\" VI. v. 51, 52.\r\n\r\n (11) Probably Xenophon's own son Gryllus was among them.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts now working in the mind of Epaminondas were such as these:\r\nthat within a few days he would be forced to retire, as the period of\r\nthe campaign was drawing to a close; if it ended in his leaving in the\r\nlurch those allies whom he came out to assist, they would be besieged\r\nby their antagonists. What a blow would that be to his own fair fame,\r\nalready somewhat tarnished! Had he not been defeated in Lacedaemon, with\r\na large body of heavy infantry, by a handful of men? defeated again at\r\nMantinea, in the cavalry engagement, and himself the main cause\r\nfinally of a coalition between five great powers--that is to say,\r\nthe Lacedaemonians, the Arcadians, the Achaeans, the Eleians, and the\r\nAthenians? On all grounds it seemed to him impossible to steal past\r\nwithout a battle. And the more so as he computed the alternatives of\r\nvictory or death. If the former were his fortune, it would resolve all\r\nhis perplexities; if death, his end would be noble. How glorious a thing\r\nto die in the endeavour to leave behind him, as his last legacy to his\r\nfatherland, the empire of Peloponnesus! That such thoughts should pass\r\nthrough his brain strikes me as by no means wonderful, as these are\r\nthoughts distinctive to all men of high ambition. Far more wonderful to\r\nmy mind was the pitch of perfection to which he had brought his army.\r\nThere was no labour which his troops would shrink from, either by night\r\nor by day; there was no danger they would flinch from; and, with the\r\nscantiest provisions, their discipline never failed them.\r\n\r\nAnd so, when he gave his last orders to them to prepare for impending\r\nbattle, they obeyed with alacrity. He gave the word; the cavalry fell\r\nto whitening their helmets, the heavy infantry of the Arcadians began\r\ninscribing their clubs as the crest on their shields, (12) as though\r\nthey were Thebans, and all were engaged in sharpening their lances and\r\nswords and polishing their heavy shields. When the preparations were\r\ncomplete and he had led them out, his next movement is worthy of\r\nattention. First, as was natural, he paid heed to their formation, and\r\nin so doing seemed to give clear evidence that he intended battle; but\r\nno sooner was the army drawn up in the formation which he preferred,\r\nthan he advanced, not by the shortest route to meet the enemy, but\r\ntowards the westward-lying mountains which face Tegea, and by this\r\nmovement created in the enemy an expectation that he would not do battle\r\non that day. In keeping with this expectation, as soon as he arrived at\r\nthe mountain-region, he extended his phalanx in long line and piled arms\r\nunder the high cliffs; and to all appearance he was there encamping.\r\nThe effect of this manouvre on the enemy in general was to relax the\r\nprepared bent of their souls for battle, and to weaken their tactical\r\narrangements. Presently, however, wheeling his regiments (which were\r\nmarching in column) to the front, with the effect of strengthening the\r\nbeak-like (13) attack which he proposed to lead himself, at the same\r\ninstant he gave the order, \"Shoulder arms, forward,\" and led the way,\r\nthe troops following.\r\n\r\n (12) Grote (\"H. G.\" x. 463) has another interpretation.\r\n\r\n (13) Or, \"the wedge-like attack of his own division\"; see Grote, \"H.\r\n    G.\" x. 469 foll. I do not, however, think that the attacking\r\n    column was actually wedge-shaped like the \"acies cuneata\" of the\r\n    Romans. It was the unusual depth of the column which gave it the\r\n    force of an ironclad's ram. Cf. \"Cyrop.\" II. iv. for {eis\r\n    metopon}.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy saw them so unexpectedly approaching, not one of them\r\nwas able to maintain tranquility: some began running to their divisions,\r\nsome fell into line, some might be seen bitting and bridling their\r\nhorses, some donning their cuirasses, and one and all were like men\r\nabout to receive rather than to inflict a blow. He, the while, with\r\nsteady impetus pushed forward his armament, like a ship-of-war prow\r\nforward. Wherever he brought his solid wedge to bear, he meant to cleave\r\nthrough the opposing mass, and crumble his adversary's host to pieces.\r\nWith this design he prepared to throw the brunt of the fighting on the\r\nstrongest half of his army, while he kept the weaker portion of it in\r\nthe background, knowing certainly that if worsted it would only cause\r\ndiscouragement to his own division and add force to the foe. The cavalry\r\non the side of his opponents were disposed like an ordinary phalanx\r\nof heavy infantry, regular in depth and unsupported by foot-soldiers\r\ninterspersed among the horses. (14) Epaminondas again differed in\r\nstrengthening the attacking point of his cavalry, besides which he\r\ninterspersed footmen between their lines in the belief that, when he\r\nhad once cut through the cavalry, he would have wrested victory from the\r\nantagonist along his whole line; so hard is it to find troops who will\r\ncare to keep their own ground when once they see any of their own side\r\nflying. Lastly, to prevent any attempt on the part of the Athenians, who\r\nwere on the enemy's left wing, to bring up their reliefs in support of\r\nthe portion next them, he posted bodies of cavalry and heavy infantry on\r\ncertain hillocks in front of them, intending to create in their minds an\r\napprehension that, in case they offered such assistance, they would be\r\nattacked on their own rear by these detachments. Such was the plan of\r\nencounter which he formed and executed; nor was he cheated in his hopes.\r\nHe had so much the mastery at his point of attack that he caused the\r\nwhole of the enemy's troops to take flight.\r\n\r\n (14) See Rustow and Kochly, p. 176; and for the {amippoi}\r\n    Harpocration, s.v.; Pollus, i. 131; \"Hipparch.\" v. 13; Thuc. v.\r\n    58; Herod. vii. 158; Caes. \"B. G.\" i. 48; \"B. Civ.\" iii. 84.\r\n\r\nBut after he himself had fallen, the rest of the Thebans were not able\r\nany longer to turn their victory rightly to account. Though the\r\nmain battle line of their opponents had given way, not a single man\r\nafterwards did the victorious hoplites slay, not an inch forward did\r\nthey advance from the ground on which the collision took place. Though\r\nthe cavalry had fled before them, there was no pursuit; not a man,\r\nhorseman or hoplite, did the conquering cavalry cut down; but, like men\r\nwho have suffered a defeat, as if panic-stricken (15) they slipped\r\nback through the ranks of the fleeing foemen. Only the footmen fighting\r\namongst the cavalry and the light infantry, who had together shared in\r\nthe victory of the cavalry, found their way round to the left wing as\r\nmasters of the field, but it cost them dear; here they encountered the\r\nAthenians, and most of them were cut down.\r\n\r\n (15) Or, \"they timorously slipped back.\"\r\n\r\nThe effective result of these achievements was the very opposite of that\r\nwhich the world at large anticipated. Here, where well-nigh the whole\r\nof Hellas was met together in one field, and the combatants stood rank\r\nagainst rank confronted, there was no one doubted that, in the event\r\nof battle, the conquerors would this day rule; and that those who lost\r\nwould be their subjects. But God so ordered it that both belligerents\r\nalike set up trophies as claiming victory, and neither interfered with\r\nthe other in the act. Both parties alike gave back their enemy's dead\r\nunder a truce, and in right of victory; both alike, in symbol of defeat,\r\nunder a truce took back their dead. And though both claimed to have won\r\nthe day, neither could show that he had thereby gained any accession of\r\nterritory, or state, or empire, or was better situated than before the\r\nbattle. Uncertainty and confusion, indeed, had gained ground, being\r\ntenfold greater throughout the length and breadth of Hellas after the\r\nbattle than before.\r\n\r\nAt this point I lay aside my pen: the sequel of the story may haply\r\ncommend itself (16) to another.\r\n\r\n (16) Or, \"win the attention of some other writer.\"",
