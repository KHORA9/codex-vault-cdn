Extreme condensation\r\nin presenting the leading facts of architectural history has been\r\nnecessary, and much that would rightly claim place in a larger work has\r\nbeen omitted here. The danger was felt to be rather in the direction of\r\ntoo much detail than of too little. While the book is intended primarily\r\nto meet the special requirements of the college student, those of the\r\ngeneral reader have not been lost sight of. The majority of the\r\ntechnical terms used are defined or explained in the context, and the\r\nsmall remainder in a glossary at the end of the work. Extended criticism\r\nand minute description were out of the question, and discussion of\r\ncontroverted points has been in consequence as far as possible avoided.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations have been carefully prepared with a view to\r\nelucidating the text, rather than for pictorial effect. With the\r\nexception of some fifteen cuts reproduced from Lübke’s _Geschichte der\r\nArchitektur_ (by kind permission of Messrs. Seemann, of Leipzig), the\r\nillustrations are almost all entirely new. A large number are from\r\noriginal drawings made by myself, or under my direction, and the\r\nremainder are, with a few exceptions, half-tone reproductions prepared\r\nspecially for this work from photographs in my possession.\r\nAcknowledgments are due to Messrs. H. W. Buemming, H. D. Bultman, and\r\nA. E. Weidinger for valued assistance in preparing original drawings;\r\nand to Professor W. R. Ware, to Professor W. H. Thomson, M.D., and to\r\nthe Editor of the Series for much helpful criticism and suggestion.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the lists of monuments appended to the history of each\r\nperiod down to the present century may prove useful for reference, both\r\nto the student and the general reader, as a supplement to the body of\r\nthe text.\r\n\r\n  A.

As far as possible these suggestions have been\r\nincorporated in the various revisions and reprints which have appeared\r\nsince the first publication.\r\n\r\n  A. D. F.

The erection of structures devoid of beauty is mere\r\nbuilding, a trade and not an art. Edifices in which strength and\r\nstability alone are sought, and in designing which only utilitarian\r\nconsiderations have been followed, are properly works of engineering.\r\nOnly when the idea of beauty is added to that of use does a structure\r\ntake its place among works of architecture. We may, then, define\r\narchitecture as the art which seeks to harmonize in a building the\r\nrequirements of utility and of beauty. It is the most useful of the fine\r\narts and the noblest of the useful arts. It touches the life of man at\r\nevery point. It is concerned not only in sheltering his person and\r\nministering to his comfort, but also in providing him with places for\r\nworship, amusement, and business; with tombs, memorials, embellishments\r\nfor his cities, and other structures for the varied needs of a complex\r\ncivilization. It engages the services of a larger portion of the\r\ncommunity and involves greater outlays of money than any other\r\noccupation except agriculture. Everyone at some point comes in contact\r\nwith the work of the architect, and from this universal contact\r\narchitecture derives its significance as an index of the civilization of\r\nan age, a race, or a people.\r\n\r\nIt is the function of the historian of architecture to trace the origin,\r\ngrowth, and decline of the architectural styles which have prevailed in\r\ndifferent lands and ages, and to show how they have reflected the great\r\nmovements of civilization. The migrations, the conquests, the\r\ncommercial, social, and religious changes among different peoples have\r\nall manifested themselves in the changes of their architecture, and it\r\nis the historian’s function to show this. It is also his function to\r\nexplain the principles of the styles, their characteristic forms and\r\ndecoration, and to describe the great masterpieces of each style and\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n+STYLE+ is a quality; the “historic styles” are phases of development.\r\n_Style_ is character expressive of definite conceptions, as of grandeur,\r\ngaiety, or solemnity. An _historic style_ is the particular phase, the\r\ncharacteristic manner of design, which prevails at a given time and\r\nplace. It is not the result of mere accident or caprice, but of\r\nintellectual, moral, social, religious, and even political conditions.\r\nGothic architecture could never have been invented by the Greeks, nor\r\ncould the Egyptian styles have grown up in Italy. Each style is based\r\nupon some fundamental principle springing from its surrounding\r\ncivilization, which undergoes successive developments until it either\r\nreaches perfection or its possibilities are exhausted, after which a\r\nperiod of decline usually sets in. This is followed either by a reaction\r\nand the introduction of some radically new principle leading to the\r\nevolution of a new style, or by the final decay and extinction of the\r\ncivilization and its replacement by some younger and more virile\r\nelement. Thus the history of architecture appears as a connected chain\r\nof causes and effects succeeding each other without break, each style\r\ngrowing out of that which preceded it, or springing out of the\r\nfecundating contact of a higher with a lower civilization. To study\r\narchitectural styles is therefore to study a branch of the history of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nTechnically, architectural styles are identified by the means they\r\nemploy to cover enclosed spaces, by the characteristic forms of the\r\nsupports and other members (piers, columns, arches, mouldings,\r\ntraceries, etc.), and by their decoration. The +plan+ should receive\r\nspecial attention, since it shows the arrangement of the points of\r\nsupport, and hence the nature of the structural design. A comparison,\r\nfor example, of the plans of the Hypostyle Hall at Karnak (Fig. 11, h)\r\nand of the Basilica of Constantine (Fig. 58) shows at once a radical\r\ndifference in constructive principle between the two edifices, and hence\r\na difference of style.\r\n\r\n\r\n+STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES.+ All architecture is based on one or more of\r\nthree fundamental structural principles; that of the _lintel_, of the\r\n_arch_ or _vault_, and of the _truss_. The principle of the +lintel+ is\r\nthat of resistance to transverse strains, and appears in all\r\nconstruction in which a cross-piece or beam rests on two or more\r\nvertical supports. The +arch+ or +vault+ makes use of several pieces to\r\nspan an opening between two supports. These pieces are in compression\r\nand exert lateral pressures or _thrusts_ which are transmitted to the\r\nsupports or abutments. The thrust must be resisted either by the\r\nmassiveness of the abutments or by the opposition to it of\r\ncounter-thrusts from other arches or vaults. Roman builders used the\r\nfirst, Gothic builders the second of these means of resistance. The\r\n+truss+ is a framework so composed of several pieces of wood or metal\r\nthat each shall best resist the particular strain, whether of tension or\r\ncompression, to which it is subjected, the whole forming a compound beam\r\nor arch. It is especially applicable to very wide spans, and is the most\r\ncharacteristic feature of modern construction. How the adoption of one\r\nor another of these principles affected the forms and even the\r\ndecoration of the various styles, will be shown in the succeeding\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n+HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT.+ Geographically and chronologically, architecture\r\nappears to have originated in the Nile valley. A second centre of\r\ndevelopment is found in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates, not\r\nuninfluenced by the older Egyptian art. Through various channels the\r\nGreeks inherited from both Egyptian and Assyrian art, the two influences\r\nbeing discernible even through the strongly original aspect of Greek\r\narchitecture. The Romans in turn, adopting the external details of Greek\r\narchitecture, transformed its substance by substituting the Etruscan\r\narch for the Greek construction of columns and lintels. They developed a\r\ncomplete and original system of construction and decoration and spread\r\nit over the civilized world, which has never wholly outgrown or\r\nabandoned it.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Rome and the rise of Constantinople these forms\r\nunderwent in the East another transformation, called the Byzantine, in\r\nthe development of Christian domical church architecture. In the North\r\nand West, meanwhile, under the growing institutions of the papacy and of\r\nthe monastic orders and the emergence of a feudal civilization out of\r\nthe chaos of the Dark Ages, the constant preoccupation of architecture\r\nwas to evolve from the basilica type of church a vaulted structure, and\r\nto adorn it throughout with an appropriate dress of constructive and\r\nsymbolic ornament. Gothic architecture was the outcome of this\r\npreoccupation, and it prevailed throughout northern and western Europe\r\nuntil nearly or quite the close of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nDuring this fifteenth century the Renaissance style matured in Italy,\r\nwhere it speedily triumphed over Gothic fashions and produced a\r\nmarvellous series of civic monuments, palaces, and churches, adorned\r\nwith forms borrowed or imitated from classic Roman art. This influence\r\nspread through Europe in the sixteenth century, and ran a course of two\r\ncenturies, after which a period of servile classicism was followed by a\r\nrapid decline in taste. To this succeeded the eclecticism and confusion\r\nof the nineteenth century, to which the rapid growth of new requirements\r\nand development of new resources have largely contributed.\r\n\r\nIn Eastern lands three great schools of architecture have grown up\r\ncontemporaneously with the above phases of Western art; one under the\r\ninfluence of Mohammedan civilization, another in the Brahman and\r\nBuddhist architecture of India, and the third in China and Japan. The\r\nfirst of these is the richest and most important. Primarily inspired\r\nfrom Byzantine art, always stronger on the decorative than on the\r\nconstructive side, it has given to the world the mosques and palaces of\r\nNorthern Africa, Moorish Spain, Persia, Turkey, and India. The other two\r\nschools seem to be wholly unrelated to the first, and have no affinity\r\nwith the architecture of Western lands.\r\n\r\nOf Mexican, Central American, and South American architecture so little\r\nis known, and that little is so remote in history and spirit from the\r\nstyles above enumerated, that it belongs rather to archæology than to\r\narchitectural history, and will not be considered in this work.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The reader’s attention is called to the Appendix to this volume,\r\nin which are gathered some of the results of recent investigations and\r\nof the architectural progress of the last few years which could not\r\nreadily be introduced into the text of this edition. The General\r\nBibliography and the lists of books recommended have been revised and\r\nbrought up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE AND PREHISTORIC ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: Desor, _Les constructions lacustres du lac de\r\n  Neufchatel_. Fergusson, _Rude Stone Monuments_. R. C. Hoare,\r\n  _Ancients Wiltshire_. Lyell, _The Antiquity of Man_. Lubbock,\r\n  _Prehistoric Times_. Nadaillac, _Prehistoric America_. Rougemont,\r\n  _L’age du Bronze_. Tylor, _Primitive Culture_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+EARLY BEGINNINGS.+ It is impossible to trace the early stages of the\r\nprocess by which true architecture grew out of the first rude attempts\r\nof man at building. The oldest existing monuments of architecture--those\r\nof Chaldæa and Egypt--belong to an advanced civilization. The rude and\r\nelementary structures built by savage and barbarous peoples, like the\r\nHottentots or the tribes of Central Africa, are not in themselves works\r\nof architecture, nor is any instance known of the evolution of a\r\ncivilized art from such beginnings. So far as the monuments testify, no\r\nsavage people ever raised itself to civilization, and no primitive\r\nmethod of building was ever developed into genuine architecture, except\r\nby contact with some existing civilization of which it appropriated the\r\nspirit, the processes, and the forms. How the earliest architecture came\r\ninto existence is as yet an unsolved problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PRIMITIVE ARCHITECTURE+ is therefore a subject for the archæologist\r\nrather than the historian of art, and needs here only the briefest\r\nmention. If we may judge of the condition of the primitive races of\r\nantiquity by that of the savage and barbarous peoples of our own time,\r\nthey required only the simplest kinds of buildings, though the purposes\r\nwhich they served were the same as those of later times in civilized\r\ncommunities. A hut or house for shelter, a shrine of some sort for\r\nworship, a stockade for defence, a cairn or mound over the grave of the\r\nchief or hero, were provided out of the simplest materials, and these\r\noften of a perishable nature. Poles supplied the framework; wattles,\r\nskins, or mud the walls; thatching or stamped earth the roof. Only the\r\nsimplest tools were needed for such elementary construction. There was\r\ningenuity and patient labor in work of this kind; but there was no\r\nplanning, no fitting together into a complex organism of varied\r\nmaterials shaped with art and handled with science. Above all, there was\r\nno progression toward higher ideals of fitness and beauty. Rudimentary\r\nart displayed itself mainly in objects of worship, or in carvings on\r\ncanoes and weapons, executed as talismans to ward off misfortune or to\r\ncharm the unseen powers; but even this art was sterile and never grew of\r\nitself into civilized and progressive art.\r\n\r\nYet there must have been at some point in the remote past an exception\r\nto this rule. Somewhere and somehow the people of Egypt must have\r\ndeveloped from crude beginnings the architectural knowledge and resource\r\nwhich meet us in the oldest monuments, though every vestige of that\r\nearly age has apparently perished. But although nothing has come down to\r\nus of the actual work of the builders who wrought in the primitive ages\r\nof mankind, there exist throughout Europe and Asia almost countless\r\nmonuments of a primitive character belonging to relatively recent times,\r\nbut executed before the advent of historic civilization to the regions\r\nwhere they are found. A general resemblance among them suggests a common\r\nheritage of traditions from the hoariest antiquity, and throws light on\r\nthe probable character of the transition from barbaric to civilized\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PREHISTORIC MONUMENTS.+ These monuments vary widely as well as in\r\nexcellence; some of them belong to Roman or even Christian times; others\r\nto a much remoter period. They are divided into two principal classes,\r\nthe megalithic structures and lake dwellings. The latter class may be\r\ndismissed with the briefest mention. It comprises a considerable number\r\nof very primitive houses or huts built on wooden piles in the lakes of\r\nSwitzerland and several other countries in both hemispheres, and forming\r\nin some cases villages of no mean size. Such villages, built over the\r\nwater for protection from attack, are mentioned by the writers of\r\nantiquity and portrayed on Assyrian reliefs. The objects found in them\r\nreveal an incipient but almost stationary civilization, extending back\r\nfrom three thousand to five thousand years or more, and lasting through\r\nthe ages of stone and bronze down into historic times.\r\n\r\nThe +megalithic+ remains of Europe and Asia are far more important. They\r\nare very widely distributed, and consist in most cases of great blocks\r\nof stone arranged in rows, circles, or avenues, sometimes with huge\r\nlintels resting upon them. Upright stones without lintels are called\r\n_menhirs_; standing in pairs with lintels they are known as _dolmens_;\r\nthe circles are called _cromlechs_. Some of the stones are of gigantic\r\nsize, some roughly hewn into shape; others left as when quarried. Their\r\nage and purpose have been much discussed without reaching positive\r\nresults. It is probable that, like the lake dwellings, they cover a long\r\nrange of time, reaching from the dawn of recorded history some thousands\r\nof years back into the unknown past, and that they were erected by races\r\nwhich have disappeared before the migrations to which Europe owes her\r\npresent populations. That most of them were in some way connected with\r\nthe worship of these prehistoric peoples is generally admitted; but\r\nwhether as temples, tombs, or memorials of historical or mythical events\r\ncannot, in all cases, be positively asserted. They were not dwellings or\r\npalaces, and very few were even enclosed buildings. They are imposing by\r\nthe size and number of their immense stones, but show no sign of\r\nadvanced art, or of conscious striving after beauty of design. The small\r\nnumber of “carved stones,” bearing singular ornamental patterns,\r\nsymbolic or mystical rather than decorative in intention, really tends\r\nto prove this statement rather than to controvert it. It is not\r\nimpossible that the dolmens were generally intended to be covered by\r\nmounds of earth. This would group them with the tumuli referred to\r\nbelow, and point to a sepulchral purpose in their erection. Some\r\nantiquaries, Fergusson among them, contend that many of the European\r\ncircles and avenues were intended as battle-monuments or trophies.\r\n\r\nThere are also +walls+ of great antiquity in various parts of Europe,\r\nintended for fortification; the most important of these in Greece and\r\nItaly will be referred to in later chapters. They belong to a more\r\nadvanced art, some of them even deserving to be classed among works of\r\narchaic architecture.\r\n\r\nThe +tumuli+, or burial mounds, which form so large a part of the\r\nprehistoric remains of both continents, are interesting to the architect\r\nonly as revealing the prototypes of the pyramids of Egypt and the\r\nsubterranean tombs of Mycenæ and other early Greek centres. The piling\r\nof huge cairns or commemorative heaps of stone is known from the\r\nScriptures and other ancient writings to have been a custom of the\r\ngreatest antiquity. The pyramids and the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus are\r\nthe most imposing and elaborate outgrowths of this practice, of which\r\nthe prehistoric tumuli are the simpler manifestations.\r\n\r\nThese crude and elementary products of undeveloped civilizations have no\r\nplace, however, in any list of genuine architectural works. They belong\r\nrather to the domain of archæology and ethnology, and have received this\r\nbrief mention only as revealing the beginnings of the builder’s art, and\r\nthe wide gap that separates them from that genuine architecture which\r\nforms the subject of the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS+: The most celebrated in England are at Avebury, an\r\n  avenue, large and small circles, barrows, and the great tumuli of\r\n  Bartlow and Silbury “Hills;” at Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain,\r\n  great megalithic circles and many barrows; “Sarsen stones” at\r\n  Ashdown; tumuli, dolmens, chambers, and circles in Derbyshire. In\r\n  Ireland, many cairns and circles. In Scotland, circles and barrows\r\n  in the Orkney Islands. In France, Carnac and Lokmariaker in\r\n  Brittany are especially rich in dolmens, circles, and avenues. In\r\n  Scandinavia, Germany, and Italy, in India and in Africa, are many\r\n  similar remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: Champollion, _Monuments de l’Egypte et de la\r\n  Nubie_.

The\r\nnarrow valley of the Nile, fertilized by the periodic overflow of the\r\nriver, was flanked by rocky heights, nearly vertical in many places,\r\nwhich afforded abundance of excellent building stone, while they both\r\nisolated the Egyptians and protected them from foreign aggression. At\r\nthe Delta, however, the valley widened out, with the falling away of\r\nthese heights, into broad lowlands, from which there was access to the\r\nouter world.\r\n\r\nThe art history of Egypt may be divided into five periods as follows:\r\n\r\nI. THE ANCIENT EMPIRE (cir. 4500?-3000 B.C.), comprising the first ten\r\ndynasties, with Memphis as the capital.\r\n\r\nII. THE FIRST THEBAN MONARCHY or MIDDLE EMPIRE (3000-2100 B.C.)\r\ncomprising the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth dynasties reigning at\r\nThebes.\r\n\r\nThe Hyksos invasion, or incursion of the Shepherd Kings, interrupted the\r\ncurrent of Egyptian art history for a period of unknown length, probably\r\nnot less than four or five centuries.\r\n\r\nIII. THE SECOND THEBAN MONARCHY (1700?-1000 B.C.), comprising the\r\neighteenth to twentieth dynasties inclusive, was the great period of\r\nEgyptian history; the age of conquests and of vast edifices.\r\n\r\nIV. THE DECADENCE or SAITIC PERIOD (1000-324 B.C.), comprising the\r\ndynasties twenty-one to thirty (Saitic, Bubastid, Ethiopic, etc.),\r\nreigning at Sais, Tanis, and Bubastis, and the Persian conquest;\r\na period almost barren of important monuments.\r\n\r\n(Periods III. and IV. constitute together the period of the NEW EMPIRE,\r\nif we omit the Persian dominion.)\r\n\r\nV. THE REVIVAL (from 324 B.C. to cir. 330 A.D.) comprises the Ptolemaic\r\nor Macedonian and Roman dominations.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE ANCIENT EMPIRE: THE PYRAMIDS.+ The great works of this period are\r\nalmost exclusively sepulchral, and include the most ancient buildings of\r\nwhich we have any remains. While there is little of strictly\r\narchitectural art, the overwhelming size and majesty of the Pyramids,\r\nand the audacity and skill shown in their construction, entitle them to\r\nthe first place in any sketch of this period. They number over a\r\nhundred, scattered in six groups, from Abu-Roash in the north to Meidoum\r\nin the south, and are of various shapes and sizes. They are all royal\r\ntombs and belong to the first twelve dynasties; each contains a\r\nsepulchral chamber, and each at one time possessed a small chapel\r\nadjacent to it, but this has, in almost every case, perished.\r\n\r\nThree pyramids surpass all the rest by their prodigious size; these are\r\nat Ghizeh and belong to the fourth dynasty. They are known by the names\r\nof their builders; the oldest and greatest being that of +Cheops+, or\r\nKhufu;[1] the second, that of +Chephren+, or Khafra; and the third, that\r\nof +Mycerinus+, or Menkhara. Other smaller ones stand at the feet of\r\nthese giants.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The Egyptian names known to antiquity are given\r\n    here first in the more familiar classic form, and then in the\r\n    Egyptian form.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--SECTION OF GREAT PYRAMID.\r\n  a, _King’s Chamber_; b, _Queen’s Chamber_; c, _Chamber\r\n  cut in Rock_.]\r\n\r\nThe base of the “Great Pyramid” measures 764 feet on a side; its height\r\nis 482 feet, and its volume must have originally been nearly three and\r\none-half million cubic yards (Fig. 1). It is constructed of limestone\r\nupon a plateau of rock levelled to receive it, and was finished\r\nexternally, like its two neighbors, with a coating of polished stone,\r\nsupposed by some to have been disposed in bands of different colored\r\ngranites, but of which it was long ago despoiled. It contained three\r\nprincipal chambers and an elaborate system of inclined passages, all\r\nexecuted in finely cut granite and limestone. The sarcophagus was in the\r\nuppermost chamber, above which the superincumbent weight was relieved by\r\nopen spaces and a species of rudimentary arch of Λ-shape (Fig. 2). The\r\nother two pyramids differ from that of Cheops in the details of their\r\narrangement and in size, not in the principle of their construction.\r\nChephren is 454 feet high, with a base 717 feet square. Mycerinus, which\r\nstill retains its casing of pink granite, is but 218 feet in height,\r\nwith a base 253 feet on a side.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--SECTION OF KING’S CHAMBER.]\r\n\r\nAmong the other pyramids there is considerable variety both of type and\r\nmaterial. At Sakkarah is one 190 feet high, constructed in six unequal\r\nsteps on a slightly oblong base measuring nearly 400 × 357 feet. It was\r\nattributed by Mariette to Ouenephes, of the first dynasty, though now\r\nmore generally ascribed to Senefrou of the third. At Abu-Seir and\r\nMeidoum are other stepped pyramids; at Dashour is one having a broken\r\nslope, the lower part steeper than the upper. Several at Meroë with\r\nunusually steep slopes belong to the Ethiopian dynasties of the\r\nDecadence. A number of pyramids are built of brick.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--PLAN OF SPHINX TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\n+TOMBS.+ The Ancient Empire has also left us a great number of tombs of\r\nthe type known as _Mastabas_. These are oblong rectangular structures of\r\nstone or brick with slightly inclined sides and flat ceilings. They\r\nuniformly face the east, and are internally divided into three parts;\r\nthe chamber or chapel, the _serdab_, and the well. In the first of\r\nthese, next the entrance, were placed the offerings made to the _Ka_ or\r\n“double,” for whom also scenes of festivity or worship were carved and\r\npainted on its walls to minister to his happiness in his incorporeal\r\nlife. The serdabs, or secret inner chambers, of which there were several\r\nin each mastaba, contained statues of the defunct, by which the\r\nexistence and identity of the Ka were preserved. Finally came the well,\r\nleading to the mummy chamber, deep underground, which contained the\r\nsarcophagus. The sarcophagi, both of this and later ages, are good\r\nexamples of the minor architecture of Egypt; many of them are panelled\r\nin imitation of wooden construction and richly decorated with color,\r\nsymbols, and hieroglyphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--RUINS OF SPHINX TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\n+OTHER MONUMENTS.+ Two other monuments of the Ancient Empire also claim\r\nattention: the +Sphinx+ and the adjacent so-called “+Sphinx temple+” at\r\nGhizeh. The first of these, a huge sculpture carved from the rock,\r\nrepresents Harmachis in the form of a human-headed lion. It is\r\nordinarily partly buried in the sand; is 70 feet long by 66 feet high,\r\nand forms one of the most striking monuments of Egyptian art. Close to\r\nit lie the nearly buried ruins of the temple once supposed to be that of\r\nthe Sphinx, but now proved by Petrie to have been erected in connection\r\nwith the second pyramid. The plan and present aspect of this venerable\r\nedifice are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The hall was roofed with stone\r\nlintels carried on sixteen square monolithic piers of alabaster. The\r\nwhole was buried in a rectangular mass of masonry and revetted\r\ninternally with alabaster, but was wholly destitute internally as well\r\nas externally of decoration or even of mouldings. With the exception of\r\nscanty remains of a few of the pyramid-temples or chapels, and the\r\ntemple discovered by Petrie in Meidoum, it is the only survival from the\r\ntemple architecture of that early age.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--TOMB AT ABYDOS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--TOMB AT BENI-HASSAN.]\r\n\r\n+THE MIDDLE EMPIRE: TOMBS.+ The monuments of this period, as of the\r\npreceding, are almost wholly sepulchral. We now encounter two types of\r\ntombs. One, structural and pyramidal, is represented by many examples at\r\nAbydos, the most venerated of all the burial grounds of Egypt (Fig. 5).\r\nAll of these are built of brick, and are of moderate size and little\r\nartistic interest. The second type is that of tombs cut in the vertical\r\ncliffs of the west bank of the Nile Valley. The entrance to these faces\r\neastward as required by tradition; the remoter end of the excavation\r\npointing toward the land of the Sun of Night. But such tunnels only\r\nbecome works of architecture when, in addition to the customary mural\r\npaintings, they receive a decorative treatment in the design of their\r\nstructural forms. Such a treatment appears in several tombs at\r\nBeni-Hassan, in which columns are reserved in cutting away the rock,\r\nboth in the chapel-chambers and in the vestibules or porches which\r\nprecede them. These columns are polygonal in some cases, clustered in\r\nothers. The former type, with eight, sixteen, or thirty-two sides (in\r\nthese last the _arrises_ or edges are emphasized by a slight concavity\r\nin each face, like embryonic fluting), have a square abacus, suggesting\r\nthe Greek Doric order, and giving rise to the name _proto-Doric_\r\n(Fig. 6). Columns of this type are also found at Karnak, Kalabshé,\r\nAmada, and Abydos. A reminiscence of primitive wood construction is seen\r\nin the dentils over the plain architrave of the entrance, which in other\r\nrespects recalls the triple entrances to certain mastabas of the Old\r\nEmpire. These dentils are imitations of the ends of rafters, and to some\r\narchæologists suggest a wooden origin for the whole system of columnar\r\ndesign. But these rock-cut shafts and heavy architraves in no respect\r\nresemble wooden prototypes, but point rather to an imitation cut in the\r\nrock of a well-developed, pre-existing system of stone construction,\r\nsome of whose details, however, were undoubtedly derived from early\r\nmethods of building in wood. The vault was below the chapel and reached\r\nby a separate entrance. The serdab was replaced by a niche in which was\r\nthe figure of the defunct carved from the native rock. Some of the tombs\r\nemployed in the chapel-chamber columns of quatrefoil section with\r\ncapitals like clustered buds (Fig. 7), and this type became in the next\r\nperiod one of the most characteristic forms of Egyptian architecture.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--SECTION AND HALF-PLAN OF A TOMB AT\r\n  BENI-HASSAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+TEMPLES.+ Of the temples of this period only two have left any remains\r\nof importance. Both belong to the twelfth dynasty (cir. 2200 B.C.). Of\r\none of these many badly shattered fragments have been found in the ruins\r\nof Bubastis; these show the clustered type of lotus-bud column mentioned\r\nabove. The other, of which a few columns have been identified among the\r\nruins of the Great Temple at Karnak, constituted the oldest part of that\r\nvast agglomeration of religious edifices, and employed columns of the\r\nso-called proto-Doric type. From these remains it appears that\r\nstructural stone columns as well as those cut in the rock were used at\r\nthis early period (2200 B.C.). Indeed, it is probable that the whole\r\narchitectural system of the New Empire was based on models developed in\r\nthe age we are considering; that the use of multiplied columns of\r\nvarious types and the building of temples of complex plan adorned with\r\ncolossal statues, obelisks, and painted reliefs, were perfectly\r\nunderstood and practised in this period. But the works it produced have\r\nperished, having been most probably demolished to make way for the more\r\nsumptuous edifices of later times.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE NEW EMPIRE.+ This was the grand age of Egyptian architecture and\r\nhistory. An extraordinary series of mighty men ruled the empire during a\r\nlong period following the expulsion of the Hyksos usurpers. The names of\r\nThothmes, Amenophis, Hatasu, Seti, and Rameses made glorious the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth dynasties. Foreign conquests in Ethiopia,\r\nSyria, and Assyria enlarged the territory and increased the splendor of\r\nthe empire. The majority of the most impressive ruins of Egypt belong to\r\nthis period, and it was in these buildings that the characteristic\r\nelements of Egyptian architecture were brought to perfection and carried\r\nout on the grandest scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--PLAN OF THE RAMESSEUM.\r\n  a, _Sanctuary_; b, _Hypostyle Hall_; c, _Second court_;\r\n  d, _Entrance court_; e, _Pylons_.]\r\n\r\n+TOMBS OF THE NEW EMPIRE.+ Some of these are structural, others\r\nexcavated; both types displaying considerable variety in arrangement and\r\ndetail. The rock-cut tombs of Bab-el-Molouk, among which are twenty-five\r\nroyal sepulchres, are striking both by the simplicity of their openings\r\nand the depth and complexity of their shafts, tunnels, and chambers.\r\nFrom the pipe-like length of their tunnels they have since the time of\r\nHerodotus been known by the name _syrinx_. Every precaution was taken to\r\nlead astray and baffle the intending violator of their sanctity. They\r\npenetrated hundreds of feet into the rock; their chambers, often formed\r\nwith columns and vault-like roofs, were resplendent with colored reliefs\r\nand ornament destined to solace and sustain the shadowy Ka until the\r\nsoul itself, the Ba, should arrive before the tribunal of Osiris, the\r\nSun of Night. Most impressively do these brilliant pictures,[2] intended\r\nto be forever shut away from human eyes, attest the sincerity of the\r\nEgyptian belief and the conscientiousness of the art which it inspired.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: See Van Dyke’s _History of Painting_, Figure 1.]\r\n\r\nWhile the tomb of the private citizen was complete in itself, containing\r\nthe Ka-statues and often the chapel, as well as the mummy, the royal\r\ntomb demanded something more elaborate in scale and arrangement. In some\r\ncases external structures of temple-form took the place of the\r\nunderground chapel and serdab. The royal effigy, many times repeated in\r\npainting and sculpture throughout this temple-like edifice, and flanking\r\nits gateways with colossal seated figures, made buried Ka-statues\r\nunnecessary. Of these sepulchral temples three are of the first\r\nmagnitude. They are that of +Queen Hatasu+ (XVIIIth dynasty) at\r\nDeir-el-Bahari; that of +Rameses II.+ (XIXth dynasty), the +Ramesseum+,\r\nnear by to the southwest; and that of +Rameses III.+ (XXth dynasty) at\r\nMedinet Abou still further to the southwest. Like the tombs, these were\r\nall on the west side of the Nile; so also was the sepulchral temple of\r\nAmenophis III. (XVIIIth dynasty), the +Amenopheum+, of which hardly a\r\ntrace remains except the two seated colossi which, rising from the\r\nTheban plain, have astonished travellers from the times of Pausanias and\r\nStrabo down to our own. These mutilated figures, one of which has been\r\nknown ever since classic times as the “vocal Memnon,” are 56 feet high,\r\nand once flanked the entrance to the forecourt of the temple of\r\nAmenophis. The plan of the Ramesseum, with its sanctuary, hypostyle\r\nhall, and forecourts, its pylons and obelisks, is shown in Figure 8, and\r\nmay be compared with those of other temples given on pp. 17 and 18. That\r\nof Medinet Abou resembles it closely. The Ramesseum occupies a rectangle\r\nof 590 × 182 feet; the temple of Medinet Abou measures 500 × 160 feet,\r\nnot counting the extreme width of the entrance pylons. The temple of\r\nHatasu at Deir-el-Bahari is partly excavated and partly structural,\r\na model which is also followed on a smaller scale in several lesser\r\ntombs. Such an edifice is called a _hemispeos_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE--_Continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: Same as for Chapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\n+TEMPLES.+ The surpassing glory of the New Empire was its great temples.\r\nSome of them were among the most stupendous creations of structural art.\r\nTo temples rather than palaces were the resources and energies of the\r\nkings devoted, and successive monarchs found no more splendid outlet for\r\ntheir piety and ambition than the founding of new temples or the\r\nextension and adornment of those already existing. By the forced labor\r\nof thousands of fellaheen (the system is in force to this day and is\r\nknown as the _corvée_) architectural piles of vast extent could be\r\nerected within the lifetime of a monarch. As in the tombs the internal\r\nwalls bore pictures for the contemplation of the Ka, so in the temples\r\nthe external walls, for the glory of the king and the delectation of the\r\npeople, were covered with colored reliefs reciting the monarch’s\r\nglorious deeds. Internally the worship and attributes of the gods were\r\nrepresented in a similar manner, in endless iteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--TEMPLE OF EDFOU. PLAN.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--TEMPLE OF EDFOU. SECTION.]\r\n\r\n+THE TEMPLE SCHEME.+ This is admirably shown in the temple of Khonsu, at\r\nKarnak, built by Rameses III. (XXth dynasty), and in the temple of Edfou\r\n(Figs. 9 and 10), though this belongs to the Roman period. It comprised\r\na sanctuary or _sekos_, a hypostyle (columnar) hall, known as the “hall\r\nof assembly,” and a forecourt preceded by a double pylon or gateway.\r\nEach of these parts might be made more or less complex in different\r\ntemples, but the essential features are encountered everywhere under all\r\nchanges of form. The building of a temple began with the sanctuary,\r\nwhich contained the sacred chamber and the shrine of the god, with\r\nsubordinate rooms for the priests and for various rites and functions.\r\nThese chambers were low, dark, mysterious, accessible only to the\r\npriests and king. They were given a certain dignity by being raised upon\r\na sort of platform above the general level, and reached by a few steps.\r\nThey were sumptuously decorated internally with ritual pictures in\r\nrelief. The hall was sometimes loftier, but set on a slightly lower\r\nlevel; its massive columns supported a roof of stone lintels, and light\r\nwas admitted either through clearstory windows under the roof of a\r\ncentral portion higher than the sides, as at Karnak, or over a low\r\nscreen-wall built between the columns of the front row, as at Edfou and\r\nDenderah. This method was peculiar to the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.\r\nThe court was usually surrounded by a single or double colonnade;\r\nsometimes, however, this colonnade only flanked the sides or fronted the\r\nhall, or again was wholly wanting. The _pylons_ were twin buttress-like\r\nmasses flanking the entrance gate of the court. They were shaped like\r\noblong truncated pyramids, crowned by flaring cornices, and were\r\ndecorated on the outer face with masts carrying banners, with obelisks,\r\nor with seated colossal figures of the royal builder. An avenue of\r\nsphinxes formed the approach to the entrance, and the whole temple\r\nprecinct was surrounded by a wall, usually of crude brick, pierced by\r\none or more gates with or without pylons. The piety of successive\r\nmonarchs was displayed in the addition of new hypostyle halls, courts,\r\npylons, or obelisks, by which the temple was successively extended in\r\nlength, and sometimes also in width, by the increased dimensions of the\r\nnew courts. The great Temple of Karnak most strikingly illustrates this\r\ngrowth. Begun by Osourtesen (XIIth dynasty) more than 2000 years B.C.,\r\nit was not completed in its present form until the time of the\r\nPtolemies, when the last of the pylons and external gates were erected.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--TEMPLE OF KARNAK. PLAN.]\r\n\r\nThe variations in the details of this general type were numerous. Thus,\r\nat El Kab, the temple of Amenophis III. has the sekos and hall but no\r\nforecourt. At Deir-el-Medineh the hall of the Ptolemaic Hathor-temple is\r\na mere porch in two parts, while the enclosure within the circuit wall\r\ntakes the place of the forecourt. At Karnak all the parts were repeated\r\nseveral times, and under Amenophis III. (XVIIIth dynasty) a wing was\r\nbuilt at a nearly right angle to the main structure. At Luxor, to a\r\ncomplete typical temple were added three aisles of an unfinished\r\nhypostyle hall, and an elaborate forecourt, whose axis is inclined to\r\nthat of the other buildings, owing to a bend of the river at that point.\r\nAt Abydos a complex sanctuary of many chambers extends southeast at\r\nright angles to the general mass, and the first court is without\r\ncolumns. But in all these structures a certain unity of effect is\r\nproduced by the lofty pylons, the flat roofs diminishing in height over\r\nsuccessive portions from the front to the sanctuary, the sloping\r\nwindowless walls covered with carved and painted pictures, and the dim\r\nand massive interiors of the columnar halls.\r\n\r\n\r\n+TEMPLES OF KARNAK.+ Of these various temples that of +Amen-Ra+ is\r\nincomparably the largest and most imposing. Its construction extended\r\nthrough the whole duration of the New Empire, of whose architecture it\r\nis a splendid _résumé_ (Fig. 11). Its extreme length is 1,215 feet, and\r\nits greatest width 376 feet. The sanctuary and its accessories, mainly\r\nbuilt by Thothmes I. and Thothmes III., cover an area nearly 456 × 290\r\nfeet in extent, and comprise two hypostyle halls and countless smaller\r\nhalls and chambers. It is preceded by a narrow columnar vestibule and\r\ntwo pylons enclosing a columnar atrium and two obelisks. This is entered\r\nfrom the +Great Hypostyle Hall+ (h in Fig. 11; Fig. 12), the noblest\r\nsingle work of Egyptian architecture, measuring 340 × 170 feet, and\r\ncontaining 134 columns in sixteen rows, supporting a massive stone roof.\r\nThe central columns with bell-capitals are 70 feet high and nearly 12\r\nfeet in diameter; the others are smaller and lower, with lotus-bud\r\ncapitals, supporting a roof lower than that over the three central\r\naisles. A clearstory of stone-grated windows makes up the difference in\r\nheight between these two roofs. The interior, thus lighted, was splendid\r\nwith painted reliefs, which helped not only to adorn the hall but to\r\ngive scale to its massive parts. The whole stupendous creation was the\r\nwork of three kings--Rameses I., Seti I., and Rameses II. (XIXth\r\ndynasty).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--CENTRAL PORTION OF HYPOSTYLE HALL\r\n  AT KARNAK.\r\n  (From model in Metropolitan Museum, New York.)]\r\n\r\nIn front of it was the great court, flanked by columns, and still\r\nshowing the ruins of a central avenue of colossal pillars begun, but\r\nnever completed, by the Bubastid kings of the XXIId dynasty. One or two\r\nsmaller structures and the curious lateral wing built by Amenophis III.,\r\ninterrupt the otherwise orderly and symmetrical advance of this plan\r\nfrom the sanctuary to the huge first pylon (last in point of date)\r\nerected by the Ptolemies.\r\n\r\nThe smaller temple of Khonsu, south of that of Amen-Ra, has already been\r\nalluded to as a typical example of templar design. Next to Karnak in\r\nimportance comes the +Temple of Luxor+ in its immediate neighborhood. It\r\nhas two forecourts adorned with double-aisled colonnades and connected\r\nby what seems to be an unfinished hypostyle hall. The +Ramesseum+ and\r\nthe temples of +Medinet Abou+ and +Deir-El-Bahari+ have already been\r\nmentioned (p. 15). At Gournah and Abydos are the next most celebrated\r\ntemples of this period; the first famous for its rich clustered\r\nlotus-columns, the latter for its beautiful sanctuary chambers,\r\ndedicated each to a different deity, and covered with delicate painted\r\nreliefs of the time of Seti I.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--GREAT TEMPLE OF IPSAMBOUL.]\r\n\r\n+GROTTO TEMPLES.+ Two other styles of temple remain to be noticed. The\r\nfirst is the subterranean or grotto temple, of which the two most\r\nfamous, at Ipsamboul (Abou-simbel), were excavated by Rameses II. They\r\nare truly colossal conceptions, reproducing in the native rock the main\r\nfeatures of structural temples, the court being represented by the\r\nlarger of two chambers in the Greater Temple (Fig. 13) Their façades are\r\nadorned with colossal seated figures of the builder; the smaller has\r\nalso two effigies of Nefert-Ari, his consort. Nothing more striking and\r\nboldly impressive is to be met with in Egypt than these singular\r\nrock-cut façades. Other rock-cut temples of more modest dimensions are\r\nat Addeh, Feraig, Beni-Hassan (the “Speos Artemidos”), Beit-el-Wali, and\r\nSilsileh. At Gherf-Hossein, Asseboua, and Derri are temples partly\r\nexcavated and partly structural.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PERIPTERAL TEMPLES.+ The last type of temple to be noticed is\r\nrepresented by only three or four structures of moderate size; it is the\r\n_peripteral_, in which a small chamber is surrounded by columns, usually\r\nmounted on a terrace with vertical walls. They were mere chapels, but\r\nare among the most graceful of existing ruins. At Philæ are two\r\nstructures, one by Nectanebo, the other Ptolemaic, resembling peripteral\r\ntemples, but without cella-chambers or roofs. They may have been\r\nwaiting-courts for the adjoining temples. That at Elephantine (Amenophis\r\nIII.) has square piers at the sides, and columns only at the ends.\r\nAnother by Thothmes II., at Medinet Abou, formed only a part (the\r\nsekos?) of a larger plan. At Edfou is another, belonging to the\r\nPtolemaic period.\r\n\r\n\r\n+LATER TEMPLES.+ After the architectural inaction of the Decadence came\r\na marvellous recrudescence of splendor under the Ptolemies, whose\r\nHellenic origin and sympathies did not lead them into the mistaken\r\neffort to impose Greek models upon Egyptian art. The temples erected\r\nunder their dominion, and later under Roman rule, vied with the grandest\r\nworks of the Ramessidæ, and surpassed them in the rich elaboration and\r\nvariety of their architectural details. The temple at Edfou (Figs. 9,\r\n10, 14) is the most perfectly preserved, and conforms most closely to\r\nthe typical plan; that of Isis, at Philæ, is the most elaborate and\r\nornate. Denderah also possesses a group of admirably preserved temples\r\nof the same period. At Esneh, and at Kalabshé and Kardassy or Ghertashi\r\nin Nubia are others. In all these one notes innovations of detail and a\r\nstriving for effect quite different from the simpler majesty of the\r\npreceding age (Fig. 14). One peculiar feature is the use of screen walls\r\nbuilt into the front rows of columns of the hypostyle hall. Light was\r\nadmitted above these walls, which measured about half the height of the\r\ncolumns and were interrupted at the centre by a curious doorway cut\r\nthrough their whole height and without any lintel. Long disused types of\r\ncapital were revived and others greatly elaborated; and the wall-reliefs\r\nwere arranged in bands and panels with a regularity and symmetry rather\r\nGreek than Egyptian.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--EDFOU. FRONT OF HYPOSTYLE HALL.]\r\n\r\n+ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.+ With the exception of a few purely utilitarian\r\nvaulted structures, all Egyptian architecture was based on the principle\r\nof the lintel. Artistic splendor depended upon the use of painted and\r\ncarved pictures, and the decorative treatment of the very simple\r\nsupports employed. Piers and columns sustained the roofs of such\r\nchambers as were too wide for single lintels, and produced, in halls\r\nlike those of Karnak, of the Ramesseum, or of Denderah, a stupendous\r\neffect by their height, massiveness, number, and colored decoration. The\r\nsimplest piers were plain square shafts; others, more elaborate, had\r\nlotus stalks and flowers or heads of Hathor carved upon them. The most\r\nstriking were those against whose front faces were carved colossal\r\nfigures of Osiris, as at Luxor, Medmet Abou, and Karnak (Fig. 15). The\r\ncolumns, which were seldom over six diameters in height, were treated\r\nwith greater variety; the shafts, slightly tapering upward, were either\r\nround or clustered in section, and usually contracted at the base. The\r\ncapitals with which they were crowned were usually of one of the five\r\nchief types described below. Besides round and clustered shafts, the\r\nMiddle Empire and a few of the earlier monuments of the New Empire\r\nemployed polygonal or slightly fluted shafts (see p. 11), as at Beni\r\nHassan and Karnak; these had a plain square abacus, with sometimes a\r\ncushion-like echinus beneath it. A round plinth served as a base for\r\nmost of the columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--OSIRID PIER (MEDINET ABOU).]\r\n\r\n+CAPITALS.+ The five chief types of capital were: a, the plain lotus\r\nbud, as at Karnak (Great Hall); b, the clustered lotus bud (Beni-Hassan,\r\nKarnak, Luxor, Gournah, etc.); c, the _campaniform_ or inverted bell\r\n(central aisles at Karnak, Luxor, the Ramesseum); d, the palm-capital,\r\nfrequent in the later temples; and e, the Hathor-headed, in which heads\r\nof Hathor adorn the four faces of a cubical mass surmounted by a model\r\nof a shrine (Sedinga, Edfou, Denderah, Esneh). These types were richly\r\nembellished and varied by the Ptolemaic architects, who gave a clustered\r\nor quatrefoil plan to the bell-capital, or adorned its surface with palm\r\nleaves. A few other forms are met with as exceptions. The first four are\r\nshown in Fig. 16.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the column was richly decorated in color. Lotus-leaves or\r\npetals swathed the swelling lower part of the shaft, which was elsewhere\r\ncovered with successive bands of carved pictures and of hieroglyphics.\r\nThe capital was similarly covered with carved and painted ornament,\r\nusually of lotus-flowers or leaves, or alternate stalks of lotus and\r\npapyrus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--TYPES OF COLUMN.\r\n  a, _Campaniform_; b, _Clustered Lotus-Column_; c, _Simple\r\n  Lotus-Column_; d, _Palm-Column_.]\r\n\r\nThe lintels were plain and square in section, and often of prodigious\r\nsize. Where they appeared externally they were crowned with a simple\r\ncavetto cornice, its curved surface covered with colored flutings\r\nalternating with _cartouches_ of hieroglyphics. Sometimes, especially on\r\nthe screen walls of the Ptolemaic age, this was surmounted by a cresting\r\nof adders or uræi in closely serried rank. No other form of cornice or\r\ncresting is met with. Mouldings as a means of architectural effect were\r\nsingularly lacking in Egyptian architecture. The only moulding known is\r\nthe clustered torus (_torus_ = a convex moulding of semicircular\r\nprofile), which resembles a bundle of reeds tied together with cords or\r\nribbons. It forms an astragal under the cavetto cornice and runs down\r\nthe angles of the pylons and walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--EGYPTIAN FLORAL ORNAMENT-FORMS.]\r\n\r\n+POLYCHROMY AND ORNAMENT.+ Color was absolutely essential to the\r\ndecorative scheme. In the vast and dim interiors, as well as in the\r\nblinding glare of the sun, mere sculpture or relief would have been\r\nwasted. The application of brilliant color to pictorial forms cut in low\r\nrelief, or outlined by deep incision with the edges of the figures\r\ndelicately rounded (_intaglio rilievo_) was the most appropriate\r\ntreatment possible. The walls and columns were covered with pictures\r\ntreated in this way, and the ceilings and lintels were embellished with\r\nsymbolic forms in the same manner. All the ornaments, as distinguished\r\nfrom the paintings, were symbolical, at least in their origin. Over the\r\ngateway was the solar disk or globe with wide-spread wings, the symbol\r\nof the sun winging its way to the conquest of night; upon the ceiling\r\nwere sacred vultures, zodiacs, or stars spangled on a blue ground.\r\nExternally the temples presented only masses of unbroken wall; but\r\nthese, as well as the pylons, were covered with huge pictures of a\r\nhistorical character. Only in the tombs do we find painted ornament of a\r\npurely conventional sort (Fig. 17). Rosettes, diaper patterns, spirals,\r\nand checkers are to be met with in them; but many of these can be traced\r\nto symbolic origins.[3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: See Goodyear’s _Grammar of the Lotus_ for an\r\n    elaborate and ingenious presentation of the theory of a common\r\n    lotus-origin for all the conventional forms occurring in Egyptian\r\n    ornament.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.+ The only remains of palaces are the pavilion of\r\nRameses III. at Medinet Abou, and another at Semneh. The Royal Labyrinth\r\nhas so completely perished that even its site is uncertain. The\r\nEgyptians lived so much out of doors that the house was a less important\r\nedifice than in colder climates. Egyptian dwellings were probably in\r\nmost cases built of wood or crude brick, and their disappearance is thus\r\neasily explained. Relief pictures on the monuments indicate the use of\r\nwooden framing for the walls, which were probably filled in with crude\r\nbrick or panels of wood. The architecture was extremely simple. Gateways\r\nlike those of the temples on a smaller scale, the cavetto cornice on the\r\nwalls, and here and there a porch with carved columns of wood or stone,\r\nwere the only details pretending to elegance. The ground-plans of many\r\nhouses in ruined cities, as at Tel-el-Amarna and a nameless city of\r\nAmenophis IV., are discernible in the ruins; but the superstructures are\r\nwholly wanting. It was in religious and sepulchral architecture that the\r\nconstructive and artistic genius of the Egyptians was most fully\r\nmanifested.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS+: The principal necropolis regions of Egypt are centred\r\n  about Ghizeh and ancient Memphis for the Old Empire (pyramids and\r\n  mastabas), Thebes for the Middle Empire (Silsileh, Beni Hassan),\r\n  and Thebes (Vale of the Kings, Vale of the Queens) and Abydos for\r\n  the New Empire.\r\n\r\n  The Old Empire has also left us the Sphinx, Sphinx temple, and the\r\n  temple at Meidoum.\r\n\r\n  The most important temples of the New Empire were those of Karnak\r\n  (the great temple, the southern or temple of Khonsu), of Luxor,\r\n  Medinet Abou (great temple of Rameses III., lesser temples of\r\n  Thothmes II. and III. with peripteral sekos; also Pavilion of\r\n  Rameses III.); of Abydos; of Gournah; of Eilithyia (Amenophis\r\n  III.); of Soleb and Sesebi in Nubia; of Elephantine (peripteral);\r\n  the tomb temple of Deir-el-Bahari, the Ramesseum, the Amenopheum;\r\n  hemispeos at Gherf Hossein; two grotto temples at Ipsamboul.\r\n\r\n  At Meroë are pyramids of the Ethiopic kings of the Decadence.\r\n\r\n  Temples of the Ptolemaic period: Philæ, Denderah.\r\n\r\n  Temples of the Roman period: Koum Ombos, Edfou; Kalabshé, Kardassy\r\n  and Dandour in Nubia; Esneh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCHALDÆAN AND ASSYRIAN ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: As before, Reber.

The kingdoms of Chaldæa and Assyria\r\nwhich ruled in this valley, sometimes as rivals and sometimes as\r\nsubjects one of the other, differed considerably in character and\r\nculture. But the scarcity of timber and the lack of good building-stone\r\nexcept in the limestone table-lands and more distant mountains of upper\r\nMesopotamia, the abundance of clay, and the flatness of the country,\r\nimposed upon the builders of both nations similar restrictions of\r\nconception, form, and material. Both peoples, moreover, were probably,\r\nin part at least, of Semitic race.[4] The Chaldæans attained\r\ncivilization as early as 4000 B.C., and had for centuries maintained\r\nfixed institutions and practised the arts and sciences when the\r\nAssyrians began their career as a nation of conquerors by reducing\r\nChaldæa to subjection.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: This is denied by some recent writers, so far as\r\n    the Chaldæans are concerned, and is not intended here to apply\r\n    to the Accadians and Summerians of primitive Chaldæa.]\r\n\r\nThe history of Chaldæo-Assyrian art may be divided into three main\r\nperiods, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The EARLY CHALDÆAN, 4000 to 1250 B.C.\r\n\r\n2. The ASSYRIAN, 1250 to 606 B.C.\r\n\r\n3. The BABYLONIAN, 606 to 538 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn 538 the empire fell before the Persians.\r\n\r\n\r\n+GENERAL CHARACTER OF MONUMENTS.+ Recent excavations at Nippur (Niffer),\r\nthe sacred city of Chaldæa, have uncovered ruins older than the\r\nPyramids. Though of slight importance architecturally, they reveal the\r\nearly knowledge of the arch and the possession of an advanced culture.\r\nThe poverty of the building materials of this region afforded only the\r\nmost limited resources for architectural effect. Owing to the flatness\r\nof the country and the impracticability of building lofty structures\r\nwith sun-dried bricks, elevation above the plain could be secured only\r\nby erecting buildings of moderate height upon enormous mounds or\r\nterraces, built of crude brick and faced with hard brick or stone. This\r\nled to the development of the stepped pyramid as the typical form of\r\nChaldæo-Assyrian architecture. Thick walls were necessary both for\r\nstability and for protection from the burning heat of that climate. The\r\nlack of stone for columns and the difficulty of procuring heavy beams\r\nfor long spans made broad halls and chambers impossible. The plans of\r\nAssyrian palaces look like assemblages of long corridors and small cells\r\n(Fig. 18). Neither the wooden post nor the column played any part in\r\nthis architecture except for window-mullions and subordinate members.[5]\r\nIt is probable that the vault was used for roofing many of the halls;\r\nthe arch was certainly employed for doors and the barrel-vault for the\r\ndrainage-tunnels under the terraces, made necessary by the heavy\r\nrainfall. What these structures lacked in durability and height was made\r\nup in decorative magnificence. The interior walls were wainscoted to a\r\nheight of eight or nine feet with alabaster slabs covered with those\r\nlow-relief pictures of hunting scenes, battles, and gods, which now\r\nenrich the museums of London, Paris, and other modern cities. Elsewhere\r\npainted plaster or more durable enamelled tile in brilliant colors\r\nembellished the walls, and, doubtless, rugs and tapestries added their\r\nrichness to this architectural splendor.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: See Fergusson, _Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis_,\r\n    for an ingenious but unsubstantiated argument for the use of\r\n    columns in Assyrian palaces.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--PALACE OF SARGON AT KHORSABAD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHALDÆAN ARCHITECTURE.+ The ruins at Mugheir (the Biblical Ur), dating,\r\nperhaps, from 2200 B.C., belong to the two-storied terrace or platform\r\nof a temple to Sin or Hurki. The wall of sun-dried brick is faced with\r\nenamelled tile. The shrine, which was probably small, has wholly\r\ndisappeared from the summit of the mound. At Warka (the ancient Erech)\r\nare two terrace-walls of palaces, one of which is ornamented with convex\r\nflutings and with a species of mosaic in checker patterns and zigzags,\r\nformed by terra-cotta cones or spikes driven into the clay, their\r\nexposed bases being enamelled in the desired colors. The other shows a\r\nsystem of long, narrow panels, in a style suggesting the influence of\r\nEgyptian models through some as yet unknown channel. This panelling\r\nbecame a common feature of the later Assyrian art (see Fig. 19). At\r\nBirs-Nimroud are the ruins of a stepped pyramid surmounted by a small\r\nshrine. Its seven stages are said to have been originally faced with\r\nglazed tile of the seven planetary colors, gold, silver, yellow, red,\r\nblue, white, and black. The ruins at Nippur, which comprise temples,\r\naltars, and dwellings dating from 4000 B.C., have been alluded to.\r\nBabylon, the later capital of Chaldæa, to which the shapeless mounds of\r\nMujehbeh and Kasr seem to have belonged, has left no other recognizable\r\nvestige of its ancient magnificence.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ASSYRIAN ARCHITECTURE.+ Abundant ruins exist of Nineveh, the Assyrian\r\ncapital, and its adjacent palace-sites. Excavations at Koyunjik,\r\nKhorsabad, and Nimroud have laid bare a number of these royal dwellings.\r\nAmong them are the palace of Assur-nazir-pal (885 B.C.) and two palaces\r\nof Shalmaneser II. (850 B.C.) at Nimroud; the great palace of Sargon at\r\nKhorsabad (721 B.C.); that of Sennacherib at Koyunjik (704 B.C.); of\r\nEsarhaddon at Nimroud (650 B.C.); and of Assur-bani-pal at Koyunjik (660\r\nB.C.). All of these palaces are designed on the same general principle,\r\nbest shown by the plan (Fig. 18) of the palace of Sargon at Khorsabad,\r\nexcavated by Botta and Place.\r\n\r\nIn this palace two large and several smaller courts are surrounded by a\r\ncomplex series of long, narrow halls and small, square chambers. One\r\ncourt probably belonged to the harem, another to the king’s apartments,\r\nothers to dependents and to the service of the palace. The crude brick\r\nwalls are immensely thick and without windows, the only openings being\r\nfor doors. The absence of columns made wide halls impossible, and great\r\nsize could only be attained in the direction of length. A terraced\r\npyramid supported an altar or shrine to the southwest of the palace; at\r\nthe west corner was a temple, the substructure of which was crowned by a\r\ncavetto cornice showing plainly the influence of Egyptian models. The\r\nwhole palace stood upon a stupendous platform faced with cut stone, an\r\nunaccustomed extravagance in Assyria.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--GATE, KHORSABAD.]\r\n\r\n+ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.+ There is no evidence that the Assyrians ever\r\nused columnar supports except in minor or accessory details. There are\r\nfew halls in any of the ruins too wide to be spanned by good Syrian\r\ncedar beams or palm timbers, and these few cases seem to have had\r\nvaulted ceilings. So clumsy a feature as the central wall in the great\r\nhall of Esarhaddon’s palace at Nimroud would never have been resorted to\r\nfor the support of the ceiling, had the Assyrians been familiar with the\r\nuse of columns. That they understood the arch and vault is proved by\r\ntheir admirable terrace-drains and the fine arched gate in the walls of\r\nKhorsabad (Fig. 19), as well as by bas-reliefs representing dwellings\r\nwith domes of various forms. Moreover, a few vaulted chambers of\r\nmoderate size, and fallen fragments of crude brick vaulting of larger\r\nspan, have been found in several of the Assyrian ruins.\r\n\r\nThe construction was extremely simple. The heavy clay walls were faced\r\nwith alabaster, burned brick, or enamelled tiles. The roofs were\r\nprobably covered with stamped earth, and sometimes paved on top with\r\ntiles or slabs of alabaster to form terraces. Light was introduced most\r\nprobably through windows immediately under the roof and divided by small\r\ncolumns forming mullions, as suggested by certain relief pictures. No\r\nother system seems consistent with the windowless walls of the ruins. It\r\nis possible that many rooms depended wholly on artificial light or on\r\nthe scant rays coming through open doors. To this day, in the hot season\r\nthe population of Mosul takes refuge from the torrid heats of summer in\r\nwindowless basements lighted only by lamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ORNAMENT.+ The only structural decorations seem to have been the\r\npanelling of exterior walls in a manner resembling the Chaldæan\r\nterrace-walls, and a form of parapet like a stepped cresting. There were\r\nno characteristic mouldings, architraves, capitals, or cornices. Nearly\r\nall the ornament was of the sort called _applied_, _i.e._, added after\r\nthe completion of the structure itself. Pictures in low relief covered\r\nthe alabaster revetment. They depicted hunting-scenes, battles, deities,\r\nand other mythological subjects, and are interesting to the architect\r\nmainly for their occasional representations of buildings and details of\r\nconstruction. Above this wainscot were friezes of enamelled brick\r\nornamented with symbolic forms used as decorative motives; winged bulls,\r\nthe “sacred tree” and mythological monsters, with rosettes, palmettes,\r\nlotus-flowers, and _guilloches_ (ornaments of interlacing bands winding\r\nabout regularly spaced buttons or eyes). These ornaments were also used\r\non the archivolts around the great arches of palace gates. The most\r\nsingular adornments of these gates were the carved “portal guardians”\r\nset into the deep jambs--colossal monsters with the bodies of bulls, the\r\nwings of eagles, and human heads of terrible countenance. Of mighty\r\nbulk, they were yet minutely wrought in every detail of head-dress,\r\nbeard, feathers, curly hair, and anatomy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--ASSYRIAN ORNAMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe purely conventional ornaments mentioned above--the rosette,\r\nguilloche, and lotus-flower, and probably also the palmette, were\r\nderived from Egyptian originals. They were treated, however, in a quite\r\nnew spirit and adapted to the special materials and uses of their\r\nenvironment. Thus the form of the palmette, even if derived, as is not\r\nunlikely, from the Egyptian lotus-motive, was assimilated to the more\r\nfamiliar palm-forms of Assyria (Fig. 20).\r\n\r\nAssyrian architecture never rivalled the Egyptian in grandeur or\r\nconstructive power, in seriousness, or the higher artistic qualities. It\r\ndid, however, produce imposing results with the poorest resources, and\r\nin its use of the arch and its development of ornamental forms it\r\nfurnished prototypes for some of the most characteristic features of\r\nlater Asiatic art, which profoundly influenced both Greek and Byzantine\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS+: The most important Chaldæan and Assyrian monuments of\r\n  which there are extant remains, have already been enumerated in\r\n  the text. It is therefore unnecessary to duplicate the list here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPERSIAN, LYCIAN AND JEWISH ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: As before, Babelon; Bliss, _Excavations at\r\n  Jerusalem_.

Under the Achæmenidæ (536 to\r\n330 B.C.) palaces were built in Persepolis and Susa of a splendor and\r\nmajesty impossible in Mesopotamia, and rivalling the marvels in the Nile\r\nValley. The conquering nation of warriors who had overthrown the\r\nEgyptians and Assyrians was in turn conquered by the arts of its\r\nvanquished foes, and speedily became the most luxurious of all nations.\r\nThe Persians were not great innovators in art; but inhabiting a land of\r\nexcellent building resources, they were able to combine the Egyptian\r\nsystem of interior columns with details borrowed from Assyrian art, and\r\nsuggestions, derived most probably from the general use in Persia and\r\nCentral Asia, of wooden posts or columns as intermediate supports. Out\r\nof these elements they evolved an architecture which has only become\r\nfully known to us since the excavations of M. and Mme. Dieulafoy at Susa\r\nin 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ELEMENTS OF PERSIAN ARCHITECTURE.+ The Persians used both crude and\r\nbaked bricks, the latter far more freely than was practicable in\r\nAssyria, owing to the greater abundance of fuel. Walls when built of the\r\nweaker material were faced with baked brick enamelled in brilliant\r\ncolors, or both moulded and enamelled, to form colored pictures in\r\nrelief. Stone was employed for walls and columns, and, in conjunction\r\nwith brick, for the jambs and lintels of doors and windows. Architraves\r\nand ceiling-beams were of wood. The palaces were erected, as in Assyria,\r\nupon broad platforms, partly cut in the rock and partly structural,\r\napproached by imposing flights of steps. These palaces were composed of\r\ndetached buildings, propylæa or gates of honor, vast audience-halls open\r\non one or two sides, and chambers or dwellings partly enclosing or\r\nflanking these halls, or grouped in separate buildings. Temples appear\r\nto have been of small importance, perhaps owing to habits of out-of-door\r\nworship of fire and sun. There are few structural tombs, but there are a\r\nnumber of imposing royal sepulchres cut in the rock at Naksh-i-Roustam.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.+ The Persians, like the Egyptians, used the\r\ncolumn as an internal feature in hypostyle halls of great size, and\r\nexternally to form porches, and perhaps, also, open kiosks without\r\nwalls. The great +Hall of Xerxes+ at Persepolis covers 100,000 square\r\nfeet--more than double the area of the Hypostyle Hall at Karnak. But the\r\nPersian column was derived from wooden prototypes and used with wooden\r\narchitraves, permitting a wider spacing than is possible with stone. In\r\nthe present instance thirty-six columns sufficed for an area which in\r\nthe Karnak hall contained one hundred and thirty-four. The shafts being\r\nslender and finely fluted instead of painted or carved, the effect\r\nproduced was totally different from that sought by the Egyptians. The\r\nmost striking peculiarity of the column was the capital, which was\r\nforked (Fig. 21). In one of the two principal types the fork, formed by\r\nthe coupled fore-parts of bulls or symbolic monsters, rested directly on\r\nthe top of the shaft. In the other, two singular members were interposed\r\nbetween the fork and the shaft; the lower, a sort of double bell or\r\nbell-and-palm capital, and above it, just beneath the fork, a curious\r\ncombination of vertical scrolls or volutes, resembling certain ornaments\r\nseen in Assyrian furniture. The transverse architrave rested in the\r\nfork; the longitudinal architrave was supported on the heads of the\r\nmonsters. A rich moulded base, rather high and in some cases adorned\r\nwith carved leaves or flutings, supported the columns, which in the Hall\r\nof Xerxes were over 66 feet high and 6 feet in diameter. The architraves\r\nhave perished, but the rock-cut tomb of Darius at Naksh-i-Roustam\r\nreproduces in its façade a palace-front, showing a banded architrave\r\nwith dentils--an obvious imitation of the ends of wooden rafters on a\r\nlintel built up of several beams.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--COLUMN FROM PERSEPOLIS.]\r\n\r\nThese features of the architrave, as well as the fine flutings and\r\nmoulded bases of the columns, are found in Ionic architecture, and in\r\npart, at least, in Lycian tombs. As all these examples date from nearly\r\nthe same period, the origin of these forms and their mutual relations\r\nhave not been fully determined. The Persian capitals, however, are\r\nunique, and so far as known, without direct prototypes or derivatives.\r\nTheir constituent elements may have been borrowed from various sources.\r\nOne can hardly help seeing the Egyptian palm-capital in the lower member\r\nof the compound type (Fig. 21).\r\n\r\nThe doors and windows had banded architraves or trims and cavetto\r\ncornices very Egyptian in character. The portals were flanked, as in\r\nAssyria, by winged monsters; but these were built up in several courses\r\nof stone, not carved from single blocks like their prototypes. Plaster\r\nor, as at Susa, enamelled bricks, replaced as a wall-finish the Assyrian\r\nalabaster wainscot. These bricks, splendid in color, and moulded into\r\nrelief pictures covering large surfaces, are the oldest examples of the\r\nskill of the Persians in a branch of ceramic art in which they have\r\nalways excelled down to our own day.\r\n\r\n\r\n+LYCIAN ARCHITECTURE.+ The architecture of those Asiatic peoples which\r\nserved as intermediaries between the ancient civilizations of Egypt and\r\nAssyria on the one hand and of the Greeks on the other, need occupy us\r\nonly a moment in passing. None of them developed a complete and\r\nindependent style or produced monuments of the first rank. Those chiefly\r\nconcerned in the transmission of ideas were the Cypriotes, Phœnicians,\r\nand Lycians. The part played by other Asiatic nations is too slight to\r\nbe considered here. From Cyprus the Greeks could have learned little\r\nbeyond a few elementary notions regarding sculpture and pottery,\r\nalthough it is possible that the volute-form in Ionic architecture was\r\noriginally derived from patterns on Cypriote pottery and from certain\r\nCypriote steles, where it appears as a modified lotus motive. The\r\nPhœnicians were the world’s traders from a very early age down to the\r\nPersian conquest. They not only distributed through the Mediterranean\r\nlands the manufactures of Egypt and Assyria, but also counterfeited them\r\nand adopted their forms in decorating their own wares. But they have\r\nbequeathed us not a single architectural ruin of importance, either of\r\ntemples or palaces, nor are the few tombs still extant of sufficient\r\nartistic interest to deserve even brief mention in a work of this scope.\r\n\r\nIn Lycia, however, there arose a system of tomb-design which came near\r\ncreating a new architectural style, and which doubtless influenced both\r\nPersia and the Ionian colonies. The tombs were mostly cut in the rock,\r\nthough a few are free-standing monolithic monuments, resembling\r\nsarcophagi or small shrines mounted on a high base or pedestal.\r\n\r\nIn all of these tombs we recognize a manifest copying in stone of framed\r\nwooden structures. The walls are panelled, or imitate open structures\r\nframed of squared timbers. The roofs are often gabled, sometimes in the\r\nform of a pointed arch; they generally show a banded architrave,\r\ndentils, and a raking cornice, or else an imitation of broadly\r\nprojecting eaves with small round rafters. There are several with\r\nporches of Ionic columns; of these, some are of late date and evidently\r\ncopied from Asiatic Greek models. Others, and notably one at Telmissus,\r\nseem to be examples of a primitive Ionic, and may indeed have been early\r\nsteps in the development of that splendid style which the Ionic Greeks,\r\nboth in Asia Minor and in Attica, carried to such perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n+JEWISH ARCHITECTURE.+ The Hebrews borrowed from the art of every people\r\nwith whom they had relations, so that we encounter in the few extant\r\nremains of their architecture Egyptian, Assyrian, Phœnician, Greek,\r\nRoman, and Syro-Byzantine features, but nothing like an independent\r\nnational style. Among the most interesting of these remains are tombs of\r\nvarious periods, principally occurring in the valleys near Jerusalem,\r\nand erroneously ascribed by popular tradition to the judges, prophets,\r\nand kings of Israel. Some of them are structural, some cut in the rock;\r\nthe former (tomb of Absalom, of Zechariah) decorated with Doric and\r\nIonic engaged orders, were once supposed to be primitive types of these\r\norders and of great antiquity. They are now recognized to be debased\r\nimitations of late Greek work of the third or second century B.C. They\r\nhave Egyptian cavetto cornices and pyramidal roofs, like many Asiatic\r\ntombs. The openings of the rock-cut tombs have frames or pediments\r\ncarved with rich surface ornament showing a similar mixture of\r\ntypes--Roman triglyphs and garlands, Syrian-Greek acanthus leaves,\r\nconventional foliage of Byzantine character, and naturalistic carvings\r\nof grapes and local plant-life. The carved arches of two of the ancient\r\ncity gates (one the so-called Golden Gate) in Jerusalem display rich\r\nacanthus foliage somewhat like that of the tombs, but more vigorous and\r\nartistic. If of the time of Herod or even of Constantine, as claimed by\r\nsome, they would indicate that Greek artists in Syria created the\r\nprototypes of Byzantine ornament. They are more probably, however,\r\nByzantine restorations of the 6th century A.D.\r\n\r\nThe one great achievement of Jewish architecture was the national\r\n+Temple of Jehovah+, represented by three successive edifices on Mount\r\nMoriah, the site of the present so-called “Mosque of Omar.” The first,\r\nbuilt by Solomon (1012 B.C.) appears from the Biblical description[6] to\r\nhave combined Egyptian conceptions (successive courts, lofty\r\nentrance-pylons, the Sanctuary and the sekos or “Holy of Holies”) with\r\nPhœnician and Assyrian details and workmanship (cedar woodwork,\r\nempaistic decoration or overlaying with _repoussé_ metal work, the\r\nisolated brazen columns Jachin and Boaz). The whole stood on a mighty\r\nplatform built up with stupendous masonry and vaulted chambers from the\r\nvalley surrounding the rock on three sides. This precinct was nearly\r\ndoubled in size by Herod (18 B.C.) who extended it southward by a\r\nterrace-wall of still more colossal masonry. Some of the stones are\r\ntwenty-two feet long; one reaches the prodigious length of forty feet.\r\nThe “Wall of Lamentations” is a part of this terrace, upon which stood\r\nthe Temple on a raised platform. As rebuilt by Herod, the Temple\r\nreproduced in part the antique design, and retained the porch of Solomon\r\nalong the east side; but the whole was superbly reconstructed in white\r\nmarble with abundance of gilding. Defended by the Castle of Antonia on\r\nthe northwest, and embellished with a new and imposing triple colonnade\r\non the south, the whole edifice, a conglomerate of Egyptian, Assyrian,\r\nand Roman conceptions and forms, was one of the most singular and yet\r\nmagnificent creations of ancient art.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: 1 Kings vi.-vii.; 2 Chronicles iii.-iv.]\r\n\r\nThe temple of Zerubbabel (515 B.C.), intermediate between those above\r\ndescribed, was probably less a re-edification of the first, than a new\r\ndesign. While based on the scheme of the first temple, it appears to\r\nhave followed more closely the pattern described in the vision of\r\nEzekiel (chapters xl.-xlii.). It was far inferior to its predecessor in\r\nsplendor and costliness. No vestiges of it remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS.+ PERSIAN: at Murghab, the tomb of Cyrus, known as\r\n  Gabré-Madré-Soleiman--a gabled structure on a seven-stepped\r\n  pyramidal basement (525 B.C.). At Persepolis the palace of Darius\r\n  (521 B.C.); the Propylæa of Xerxes, his palace and his harem (?)\r\n  or throne-hall (480 B.C.). These splendid structures, several of\r\n  them of vast size, resplendent with color and majestic with their\r\n  singular and colossal columns, must have formed one of the most\r\n  imposing architectural groups in the world. At various points,\r\n  tower-like tombs, supposed erroneously by Fergusson to have been\r\n  fire altars. At Naksh-i-Roustam, the tomb of Darius, cut in the\r\n  rock. Other tombs near by at Persepolis proper and at Pasargadæ.\r\n  At the latter place remains of the palace of Cyrus. At Susa the\r\n  palace of Xerxes and Artaxerxes (480-405 B.C.).\r\n\r\n  There are no remains of private houses or temples.\r\n\r\n  LYCIAN: the principal Lycian monuments are found in Myra,\r\n  Antiphellus, and Telmissus. Some of the monolithic tombs have been\r\n  removed to the British and other European museums.\r\n\r\n  JEWISH: the temples have been mentioned above. The palace of\r\n  Solomon. The rock-cut monolithic tomb of Siloam. So-called tombs\r\n  of Absalom and Zechariah, structural; probably of Herod’s time or\r\n  later.

The Hellenic race gathered up influences and suggestions\r\nfrom both Asia and Africa and fused them with others, whose sources are\r\nunknown, into an art intensely national and original, which was to\r\ninfluence the arts of many races and nations long centuries after the\r\ndecay of the Hellenic states. The Greek mind, compared with the Egyptian\r\nor Assyrian, was more highly intellectual, more logical, more\r\nsymmetrical, and above all more inquiring and analytic. Living nowhere\r\nremote from the sea, the Greeks became sailors, merchants, and\r\ncolonizers. The Ionian kinsmen of the European Greeks, speaking a\r\ndialect of the same language, populated the coasts of Asia Minor and\r\nmany of the islands, so that through them the Greeks were open to the\r\ninfluences of the Assyrian, Phœnician, Persian, and Lycian\r\ncivilizations. In Cyprus they encountered Egyptian influences, and\r\nfinally, under Psammetichus, they established in Egypt itself the Greek\r\ncity of Naukratis. They were thus by geographical situation, by\r\ncharacter, and by circumstances, peculiarly fitted to receive, develop,\r\nand transmit the mingled influences of the East and the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 22.--LION GATE AT MYCENÆ.]\r\n\r\n+PREHISTORIC MONUMENTS.+[7] Authentic Greek history begins with the\r\nfirst Olympiad, 776 B.C. The earliest monuments of that historic\r\narchitecture which developed into the masterpieces of the Periclean and\r\nAlexandrian ages, date from the middle of the following century. But\r\nthere are a number of older buildings, belonging presumably to the\r\nso-called Heroic Age, which, though seemingly unconnected with the later\r\nhistoric development of Greek architecture, are still worthy of note.\r\nThey are the work of a people somewhat advanced in civilization,\r\nprobably the Pelasgi, who preceded the Dorians on Greek soil, and\r\nconsist mainly of fortifications, walls, gates, and tombs, the most\r\nimportant of which are at +Mycenæ+ and +Tiryns+. At the latter place is\r\na well-defined acropolis, with massive walls in which are passages\r\ncovered by stones successively overhanging or corbelled until they meet.\r\nThe masonry is of huge stones piled without cement. At Mycenæ the city\r\nwall is pierced by the remarkable +Lion Gate+ (Fig. 22), consisting of\r\ntwo jambs and a huge lintel, over which the weight is relieved by a\r\ntriangular opening. This is filled with a sculptured group, now much\r\ndefaced, representing two rampant lions flanking a singular column which\r\ntapers downward. This symbolic group has relations with Hittite and\r\nPhrygian sculptures, and with the symbolism of the worship of Rhea\r\nCybele. The masonry of the wall is carefully dressed but not regularly\r\ncoursed. Other primitive walls and gates showing openings and embryonic\r\narches of various forms, are found widely scattered, at Samos and Delos,\r\nat Phigaleia, Thoricus, Argos and many other points. The very earliest\r\nare hardly more than random piles of rough stone. Those which may fairly\r\nclaim notice for their artistic masonry are of a later date and of two\r\nkinds: the coursed, and the polygonal or Cyclopean, so called from the\r\ntradition that they were built by the Cyclopes. These Cyclopean walls\r\nwere composed of large, irregular polygonal blocks carefully fitted\r\ntogether and dressed to a fairly smooth face (Fig. 23). Both kinds were\r\nused contemporaneously, though in the course of time the regular coursed\r\nmasonry finally superseded the polygonal.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: For enlargement on this topic see Appendix A.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 23.--POLYGONAL MASONRY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+THOLOS OF ATREUS.+ All these structures present, however, only the\r\nrudiments of architectural art. The so-called +Tholos+ (or Treasury) of\r\n+Atreus+, at Mycenæ, on the other hand, shows the germs of truly\r\nartistic design (Fig. 24). It is in reality a tomb, and is one of a\r\nlarge class of prehistoric tombs found in almost every part of the\r\nglobe, consisting of a circular stone-walled and stone-roofed chamber\r\nburied under a tumulus of earth. This one is a beehive-shaped\r\nconstruction of horizontal courses of masonry, with a stone-walled\r\npassage, the _dromos_, leading to the entrance door. Though internally\r\nof domical form, its construction with horizontal beds in the masonry\r\nproves that the idea of the true dome with the beds of each course\r\npitched at an angle always normal to the curve of the vault, was not yet\r\ngrasped. A small sepulchral chamber opens from the great one, by a door\r\nwith the customary relieving triangle over it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 24.--THOLOS OF ATREUS. PLAN AND SECTION.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 25.--THOLOS OF ATREUS. DOORWAY.]\r\n\r\nTraces of a metal lining have been found on the inner surface of the\r\ndome and on the jambs of the entrance door. This entrance is the most\r\nartistic and elaborate part of the edifice (Fig. 25). The main opening\r\nis enclosed in a three-banded frame, and was once flanked by columns\r\nwhich, as shown by fragments still existing and by marks on either side\r\nthe door, tapered downward as in the sculptured column over the Lion\r\nGate. Shafts, bases, and capitals were covered with zig-zag bands or\r\nchevrons of fine spirals. This well-studied decoration, the banded\r\njambs, and the curiously inverted columns (of which several other\r\nexamples exist in or near Mycenæ), all point to a fairly developed art,\r\nderived partly from Egyptian and partly from Asiatic sources. That\r\nEgyptian influences had affected this early art is further proved by a\r\nfragment of carved and painted ornament on a ceiling in Orchomenos,\r\nimitating with remarkable closeness certain ceiling decorations in\r\nEgyptian tombs.\r\n\r\n\r\n+HISTORIC MONUMENTS; THE ORDERS.+ It was the Dorians and Ionians who\r\ndeveloped the architecture of classic Greece. This fact is perpetuated\r\nin the traditional names, Doric and Ionic, given to the two systems of\r\ncolumnar design which formed the most striking feature of that\r\narchitecture. While in Egypt the column was used almost exclusively as\r\nan internal support and decoration, in Greece it was chiefly employed to\r\nproduce an imposing exterior effect. It was the most important element\r\nin the temple architecture of the Greeks, and an almost indispensable\r\nadornment of their gateways, public squares, and temple enclosures. To\r\nthe column the two races named above gave each a special and radically\r\ndistinct development, and it was not until the Periclean age that the\r\ntwo forms came to be used in conjunction, even by the mixed Doric-Ionic\r\npeople of Attica. Each of the two types had its own special shaft,\r\ncapital, entablature, mouldings, and ornaments, although considerable\r\nvariation was allowed in the proportions and minor details. The general\r\ntype, however, remained substantially unchanged from first to last. The\r\nearliest examples known to us of either order show it complete in all\r\nits parts, its later development being restricted to the refining and\r\nperfecting of its proportions and details. The probable origin of these\r\norders will be separately considered later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE DORIC.+ The column of the Doric order (Figs. 26, 27) consists of a\r\ntapering shaft rising directly from the stylobate or platform and\r\nsurmounted by a capital of great simplicity and beauty. The shaft is\r\nfluted with sixteen to twenty shallow channellings of segmental or\r\nelliptical section, meeting in sharp edges or _arrises_. The capital is\r\nmade up of a circular cushion or _echinus_ adorned with fine grooves\r\ncalled _annulæ_, and a plain square _abacus_ or cap Upon this rests a\r\nplain architrave or _epistyle_, with a narrow fillet, the _tænia_,\r\nrunning along its upper edge. The frieze above it is divided into square\r\npanels, called the _metopes_, separated by vertical _triglyphs_ having\r\neach two vertical grooves and chamfered edges. There is a triglyph over\r\neach column and one over each intercolumniation, or two in rare\r\ninstances where the columns are widely spaced. The cornice consists of a\r\nbroadly projecting _corona_ resting on a _bed-mould_ of one or two\r\nsimple mouldings. Its under surface, called the _soffit_, is adorned\r\nwith _mutules_, square, flat projections having each eighteen _guttæ_\r\ndepending from its under side. Two or three small mouldings run along\r\nthe upper edge of the corona, which has in addition, over each slope of\r\nthe gable, a gutter-moulding or _cymatium_. The cornices along the\r\nhorizontal edges of the roof have instead of the cymatium a row of\r\n_antefixæ_, ornaments of terra-cotta or marble placed opposite the foot\r\nof each tile-ridge of the roofing. The enclosed triangular field of the\r\ngable, called the _tympanum_, was in the larger monuments adorned with\r\nsculptured groups resting on the shelf formed by the horizontal cornice\r\nbelow. Carved ornaments called _acroteria_ commonly embellished the\r\nthree angles of the gable or pediment.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 26.--GREEK DORIC ORDER.\r\n  A, _Crepidoma, or stylobate_; b, _Column_; c, _Architrave_;\r\n  d, _Tænia_; e, _Frieze_; f, _Horizontal cornice_; g, _Raking\r\n  cornice_; h, _Tympanum of pediment_; k, _Metope_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+POLYCHROMY.+ It has been fully proved, after a century of debate, that\r\nall this elaborate system of parts, severe and dignified in their\r\nsimplicity of form, received a rich decoration of color. While the\r\nprecise shades and tones employed cannot be predicated with certainty,\r\nit is well established that the triglyphs were painted blue and the\r\nmetopes red, and that all the mouldings were decorated with\r\nleaf-ornaments, “eggs-and-darts,” and frets, in red, green, blue, and\r\ngold. The walls and columns were also colored, probably with pale tints\r\nof yellow or buff, to reduce the glare of the fresh marble or the\r\nwhiteness of the fine stucco with which the surfaces of masonry of\r\ncoarser stone were primed. In the clear Greek atmosphere and outlined\r\nagainst the brilliant sky, the Greek temple must have presented an\r\naspect of rich, sparkling gayety.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 27.--DORIC ORDER OF THE PARTHENON.]\r\n\r\n+ORIGIN OF THE ORDER.+ It is generally believed that the details of the\r\nDoric frieze and cornice were reminiscences of a primitive wood\r\nconstruction. The triglyph suggests the chamfered ends of cross-beams\r\nmade up of three planks each; the mutules, the sheathing of the eaves;\r\nand the guttæ, the heads of the spikes or trenails by which the\r\nsheathing was secured. It is known that in early astylar temples the\r\nmetopes were left open like the spaces between the ends of\r\nceiling-rafters. In the earlier peripteral temples, as at Selinus, the\r\ntriglyph-frieze is retained around the cella-wall under the ceiling of\r\nthe colonnade, where it has no functional significance, as a survival\r\nfrom times antedating the adoption of the colonnade, when the tradition\r\nof a wooden roof-construction showing externally had not yet been\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nA similar wooden origin for the Doric column has been advocated by some,\r\nwho point to the assertion of Pausanias that in the Doric Heraion at\r\nOlympia the original wooden columns had with one exception been replaced\r\nby stone columns as fast as they decayed. (See p. 62.) This, however,\r\nonly proves that wooden columns were sometimes used in early buildings,\r\nnot that the Doric column was derived from them. Others would derive it\r\nfrom the Egyptian columns of Beni Hassan (p. 12), which it certainly\r\nresembles. But they do not explain how the Greeks could have been\r\nfamiliar with the Beni Hassan column long before the opening of Egypt to\r\nthem under Psammetichus; nor why, granting them some knowledge of\r\nEgyptian architecture, they should have passed over the splendors of\r\nKarnak and Luxor to copy these inconspicuous tombs perched high up on\r\nthe cliffs of the Nile. It would seem that the Greeks invented this form\r\nindependently, developing it in buildings which have perished; unless,\r\nindeed, they brought the idea with them from their primitive Aryan home\r\nin Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE IONIC ORDER+ was characterized by greater slenderness of proportion\r\nand elegance of detail than the Doric, and depended more on carving than\r\non color for the decoration of its members (Fig. 28). It was adopted in\r\nthe fifth century B.C. by the people of Attica, and used both for civic\r\nand religious buildings, sometimes alone and sometimes in conjunction\r\nwith the Doric. The column was from eight to ten diameters in height,\r\nagainst four and one-third to seven for the Doric. It stood on a base\r\nwhich was usually composed of two tori (see p. 25 for definition)\r\nseparated by a _scotia_ (a concave moulding of semicircular or\r\nsemi-elliptical profile), and was sometimes provided also with a square\r\nflat base-block, the _plinth_. There was much variety in the proportions\r\nand details of these mouldings, which were often enriched by flutings or\r\ncarved guilloches. The tall shaft bore twenty-four deep narrow flutings\r\nseparated by narrow fillets. The capital was the most peculiar feature\r\nof the order. It consisted of a bead or _astragal_ and echinus, over\r\nwhich was a horizontal band ending on either side in a scroll or volute,\r\nthe sides of which presented the aspect shown in Fig. 29. A thin moulded\r\nabacus was interposed between this member and the architrave.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 28.--GREEK IONIC ORDER. (MILETUS.)]\r\n\r\nThe Ionic capital was marked by two awkward features which all its\r\nrichness could not conceal. One was the protrusion of the echinus beyond\r\nthe face of the band above it, the other was the disparity between the\r\nside and front views of the capital, especially noticeable at the\r\ncorners of a colonnade. To obviate this, various contrivances were\r\ntried, none wholly successful. Ordinarily the two adjacent exterior\r\nsides of the corner capital were treated alike, the scrolls at their\r\nmeeting being bent out at an angle of 45°, while the two inner faces\r\nsimply intersected, cutting each other in halves.\r\n\r\nThe entablature comprised an architrave of two or three flat bands\r\ncrowned by fine mouldings; an uninterrupted frieze, frequently\r\nsculptured in relief; and a simple cornice of great beauty. In addition\r\nto the ordinary bed-mouldings there was in most examples a row of narrow\r\nblocks or _dentils_ under the corona, which was itself crowned by a high\r\ncymatium of extremely graceful profile, carved with the rich\r\n“honeysuckle” (_anthemion_) ornament. All the mouldings were carved with\r\nthe “egg-and-dart,” heart-leaf and anthemion ornaments, so designed as\r\nto recall by their outline the profile of the moulding itself. The\r\ndetails of this order were treated with much more freedom and variety\r\nthan those of the Doric. The pediments of Ionic buildings were rarely or\r\nnever adorned with groups of sculpture. The volutes and echinus of the\r\ncapital, the fluting of the shaft, the use of a moulded circular base,\r\nand in the cornice the high corona and cymatium, these were constant\r\nelements in every Ionic order, but all other details varied widely in\r\nthe different examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 29.--SIDE VIEW OF IONIC CAPITAL.]\r\n\r\n+ORIGIN OF THE IONIC ORDER.+ The origin of the Ionic order has given\r\nrise to almost as much controversy as that of the Doric. Its different\r\nelements were apparently derived from various sources. The Lycian tombs\r\nmay have contributed the denticular cornice and perhaps also the general\r\nform of the column and capital. In the Persian architecture of the sixth\r\ncentury B.C., the high moulded base, the narrow flutings of the shaft,\r\nthe carved bead-moulding and the use of scrolls in the capital are\r\ncharacteristic features, which may have been borrowed by the Ionians\r\nduring the same century, unless, indeed, they were themselves the work\r\nof Ionic or Lycian workmen in Persian employ. The banded architrave and\r\nthe use of the volute in the decoration of stele-caps (from στηλη =\r\na memorial stone or column standing isolated and upright), furniture,\r\nand minor structures are common features in Assyrian, Lycian, and other\r\nAsiatic architecture of early date. The volute or scroll itself as an\r\nindependent decorative motive may have originated in successive\r\nvariations of Egyptian lotus-patterns.[8] But the combination of these\r\ndiverse elements and their development into the final form of the order\r\nwas the work of the Ionian Greeks, and it was in the Ionian provinces of\r\nAsia Minor that the most splendid examples of its use are to be found\r\n(Halicarnassus, Miletus, Priene, Ephesus), while the most graceful and\r\nperfect are those of Doric-Ionic Attica.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: As contended by W. H. Goodyear in his _Grammar of\r\n    the Lotus_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 30.--GREEK CORINTHIAN ORDER.\r\n  (From the monument of Lysicrates.)]\r\n\r\n+THE CORINTHIAN ORDER.+ This was a late outgrowth of the Ionic rather\r\nthan a new order, and up to the time of the Roman conquest was only used\r\nfor monuments of small size (see Fig. 38). Its entablature in pure Greek\r\nexamples was identical with the Ionic; the shaft and base were only\r\nslightly changed in proportion and detail. The capital, however, was a\r\nnew departure, based probably on metallic embellishments of altars,\r\npedestals, etc., of Ionic style. It consisted in the best examples of a\r\nhigh bell-shaped core surrounded by one or two rows of acanthus leaves,\r\nabove which were pairs of branching scrolls meeting at the corners in\r\nspiral volutes. These served to support the angles of a moulded abacus\r\nwith concave sides (Fig. 30). One example, from the Tower of the Winds\r\n(the clepsydra of Andronicus Cyrrhestes) at Athens, has only smooth\r\npointed palm-leaves and no scrolls above a single row of acanthus\r\nleaves. Indeed, the variety and disparity among the different examples\r\nprove that we have here only the first steps toward the evolution of an\r\nindependent order, which it was reserved for the Romans to fully\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n\r\n+GREEK TEMPLES; THE TYPE.+ With the orders as their chief decorative\r\nelement the Greeks built up a splendid architecture of religious and\r\nsecular monuments. Their noblest works were temples, which they designed\r\nwith the utmost simplicity of general scheme, but carried out with a\r\nmastery of proportion and detail which has never been surpassed. Of\r\nmoderate size in most cases, they were intended primarily to enshrine\r\nthe simulacrum of the deity, and not, like Christian churches, to\r\naccommodate great throngs of worshippers. Nor were they, on the other\r\nhand, sanctuaries designed, like those of Egypt, to exclude all but a\r\nprivileged few from secret rites performed only by the priests and king.\r\nThe statue of the deity was enshrined in a chamber, the _naos_ (see\r\nplan, Fig. 31), often of considerable size, and accessible to the public\r\nthrough a columnar porch the _pronaos_. A smaller chamber, the\r\n_opisthodomus_, was sometimes added in the rear of the main sanctuary,\r\nto serve as a treasury or depository for votive offerings. Together\r\nthese formed a windowless structure called the _cella_, beyond which was\r\nthe rear porch, the _posticum_ or _epinaos_. This whole structure was in\r\nthe larger temples surrounded by a colonnade, the _peristyle_, which\r\nformed the most splendid feature of Greek architecture. The external\r\naisle on either side of the cella was called the _pteroma_. A single\r\ngabled roof covered the entire building.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 31.--TYPES OF GREEK TEMPLE PLANS.\r\n  a, _In Antis_; b, _Prostyle_; c, _Amphiprostyle_; d, _Peripteral_\r\n  (_The Parthenon_); N, _Naos_; O, _Opisthodomus_; S, _Statue_.]\r\n\r\nThe Greek colonnade was thus an exterior feature, surrounding the solid\r\ncella-wall instead of being enclosed by it as in Egypt. The temple was a\r\npublic, not a royal monument; and its builders aimed, not as in Egypt at\r\nsize and overwhelming sombre majesty, but rather at sunny beauty and the\r\nhighest perfection of proportion, execution, and detail (Fig. 34).\r\n\r\nThere were of course many variations of the general type just described.\r\nEach of these has received a special name, which is given below with\r\nexplanations and is illustrated in Fig. 31.\r\n\r\n_In antis_; with a porch having two or more columns enclosed between the\r\nprojecting side-walls of the cella.\r\n\r\n_Prostylar_ (or prostyle); with a columnar porch in front and no\r\nperistyle.\r\n\r\n_Amphiprostylar_ (or -style); with columnar porches at both ends but no\r\nperistyle.\r\n\r\n_Peripteral_; surrounded by columns.\r\n\r\n_Pseudoperipteral_; with false or engaged columns built into the walls\r\nof the cella, leaving no pteroma.\r\n\r\n_Dipteral_; with double lateral ranges of columns (see Fig. 39).\r\n\r\n_Pseudodipteral_; with a single row of columns on each side, whose\r\ndistance from the wall is equal to two intercolumniations of the front.\r\n\r\n_Tetrastyle_, _hexastyle_, _octastyle_, _decastyle_, etc.; with four,\r\nsix, eight, or ten columns in the end rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CONSTRUCTION.+ All the temples known to us are of stone, though it is\r\nevident from allusions in the ancient writers that wood was sometimes\r\nused in early times. (See p. 62.) The finest temples, especially those\r\nof Attica, Olympia, and Asia Minor, were of marble. In Magna Græcia, at\r\nAssos, and in other places where marble was wanting, limestone,\r\nsandstone, or lava was employed and finished with a thin, fine stucco.\r\nThe roof was almost invariably of wood and gabled, forming at the ends\r\npediments decorated in most cases with sculpture. The disappearance of\r\nthese inflammable and perishable roofs has given rise to endless\r\nspeculations as to the lighting of the cellas, which in all known ruins,\r\nexcept one at Agrigentum, are destitute of windows. It has been\r\nconjectured that light was admitted through openings in the roof, and\r\neven that the central part of the cella was wholly open to the sky. Such\r\nan arrangement is termed _hypæthral_, from an expression used in a\r\ndescription by Vitruvius;[9] but this description corresponds to no\r\nknown structure, and the weight of opinion now inclines against the use\r\nof the hypæthral opening, except possibly in one or two of the largest\r\ntemples, in which a part of the cella in front of the statue may have\r\nbeen thus left open. But even this partial _hypæthros_ is not\r\nsubstantiated by direct evidence. It hardly seems probable that the\r\nmagnificent chryselephantine statues of such temples were ever thus left\r\nexposed to the extremes of the climate, which are often severe even in\r\nGreece. In the model of the Parthenon designed by Ch. Chipiez for the\r\nMetropolitan Museum in New York, a small clerestory opening through the\r\nroof admits a moderate amount of light to the cella; but this ingenious\r\ndevice rests on no positive evidence (see Frontispiece). It seems on the\r\nwhole most probable that the cella was lighted entirely by artificial\r\nillumination; but the controversy in its present state is and must be\r\nwholly speculative.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Lib. III., Cap. I.]\r\n\r\nThe wooden roof was covered with tiles of terra-cotta or marble. It was\r\nprobably ceiled and panelled on the under side, and richly decorated\r\nwith color and gold. The pteroma had under the exterior roof a ceiling\r\nof stone or marble, deeply panelled between transverse architraves.\r\n\r\nThe naos and opisthodomus being in the larger temples too wide to be\r\nspanned by single beams, were furnished with interior columns to afford\r\nintermediate support. To avoid the extremes of too great massiveness and\r\nexcessive slenderness in these columns, they were built in two stages,\r\nand advantage was taken of this arrangement, in some cases, at least, to\r\nintroduce lateral galleries into the naos.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 32.--CARVED ANTHEMION ORNAMENT. ATHENS.]\r\n\r\n+SCULPTURE AND CARVING.+ All the architectural membering was treated\r\nwith the greatest refinement of design and execution, and the aid of\r\nsculpture, both in relief and in the round, was invoked to give splendor\r\nand significance to the monument. The statue of the deity was the focus\r\nof internal interest, while externally, groups of statues representing\r\nthe Olympian deities or the mythical exploits of gods, demigods, and\r\nheroes, adorned the gables. Relief carvings in the friezes and metopes\r\ncommemorated the favorite national myths. In these sculptures we have\r\nthe finest known adaptations of pure sculpture--_i.e._, sculpture\r\ntreated as such and complete in itself--to an architectural framework.\r\nThe noblest examples of this decorative sculpture are those of the\r\nParthenon, consisting of figures in the full round from the pediments,\r\ngroups in high relief from the metopes, and the beautiful frieze of the\r\nPanathenaic procession from the cella-wall under the pteroma ceiling.\r\nThe greater part of these splendid works are now in the British Museum,\r\nwhither they were removed by Lord Elgin in 1801. From Olympia, Ægina,\r\nand Phigaleia, other master-works of the same kind have been transferred\r\nto the museums of Europe. In the Doric style there was little carving\r\nother than the sculpture, the ornament being mainly polychromatic. Greek\r\nIonic and Corinthian monuments, however, as well as minor works such as\r\nsteles, altars, etc., were richly adorned with carved mouldings and\r\nfriezes, festoons, acroteria, and other embellishments executed with the\r\nchisel. The anthemion ornament, a form related to the Egyptian lotus and\r\nAssyrian palmette, most frequently figures in these. It was made into\r\ndesigns of wonderful vigor and beauty (Fig. 32).\r\n\r\n\r\n+DETAIL AND EXECUTION.+ In the handling and cutting of stone the Greeks\r\ndisplayed a surpassing skill and delicacy. While ordinarily they were\r\ncontent to use stones of moderate size, they never hesitated at any\r\ndimension necessary for proper effect or solid construction. The lower\r\ndrums of the Parthenon peristyle are 6 feet 6½ inches in diameter, and\r\n2 feet 10 inches high, cut from single blocks of Pentelic marble. The\r\narchitraves of the Propylæa at Athens are each made up of two lintels\r\nplaced side by side, the longest 17 feet 7 inches long, 3 feet 10 inches\r\nhigh, and 2 feet 4 inches thick. In the colossal temples of Asia Minor,\r\nwhere the taste for the vast and grandiose was more pronounced, blocks\r\nof much greater size were used. These enormous stones were cut and\r\nfitted with the most scrupulous exactness. The walls of all important\r\nstructures were built in regular courses throughout, every stone\r\ncarefully bedded with extremely close joints. The masonry was usually\r\nlaid up without cement and clamped with metal; there is no filling in\r\nwith rubble and concrete between mere facings of cut stone, as in most\r\nmodern work. When the only available stone was of coarse texture it was\r\nfinished with a coating of fine stucco, in which sharp edges and minute\r\ndetail could be worked.\r\n\r\nThe details were, in the best period, executed with the most\r\nextraordinary refinement and care. The profiles of capitals and\r\nmouldings, the carved ornament, the arrises of the flutings, were cut\r\nwith marvellous precision and delicacy. It has been rightly said that\r\nthe Greeks “built like Titans and finished like jewellers.” But this\r\nperfect finish was never petty nor wasted on unworthy or vulgar design.\r\nThe just relation of scale between the building and all its parts was\r\nadmirably maintained; the ornament was distributed with rare judgment,\r\nand the vigor of its design saved it from all appearance of triviality.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive taste of the Greeks led them into other refinements than\r\nthose of mere mechanical perfection. In the Parthenon especially, but\r\nalso in lesser degree in other temples, the seemingly straight lines of\r\nthe building were all slightly curved, and the vertical faces inclined.\r\nThis was done to correct the monotony and stiffness of absolutely\r\nstraight lines and right angles, and certain optical illusions which\r\ntheir acute observation had detected. The long horizontal lines of the\r\nstylobate and cornice were made convex upward; a similar convexity in\r\nthe horizontal corona of the pediment counteracted the seeming concavity\r\notherwise resulting from its meeting with the multiplied inclined lines\r\nof the raking cornice. The columns were almost imperceptibly inclined\r\ntoward the cella, and the corner intercolumniations made a trifle\r\nnarrower than the rest; while the vertical lines of the arrises of the\r\nflutings were made convex outward with a curve of the utmost beauty and\r\ndelicacy. By these and other like refinements there was imparted to the\r\nmonument an elasticity and vigor of aspect, an elusive and surprising\r\nbeauty impossible to describe and not to be explained by the mere\r\ncomposition and general proportions, yet manifest to every cultivated\r\neye.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: These refinements, first noticed by Allason in\r\n    1814, and later confirmed by Cockerell and Haller as to the\r\n    columns, were published to the world in 1838 by Hoffer, verified\r\n    by Penrose in 1846, and further developed by the investigations\r\n    of Ziller and later observers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGREEK ARCHITECTURE--_Continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: Same as for Chapter VI.

The oldest known temples of this period are the +Apollo\r\nTemple+ at Corinth (650 B.C.?), and the +Northern Temple+ on the\r\nacropolis at +Selinus+ in Sicily (cir. 610-590 B.C.). They are both of a\r\ncoarse limestone covered with stucco. The columns are low and massive\r\n(4⅓ to 4⅔ diameters in height), widely spaced, and carry a very high\r\nentablature. The triglyphs still appear around the cella wall under the\r\npteroma ceiling, an illogical detail destined to disappear in later\r\nbuildings. Other temples at Selinus date from the middle or latter part\r\nof the sixth century; they have higher columns and finer profiles than\r\nthose just mentioned. The great +Temple of Zeus+ at +Selinus+ was the\r\nearliest of five colossal Greek temples of very nearly identical\r\ndimensions; it measured 360 feet by 167 feet in plan, but was never\r\ncompleted. During the second half of the sixth century important Doric\r\ntemples were built at Pæstum in South Italy, and Agrigentum in Sicily;\r\nthe somewhat primitive temple at Assos in Asia Minor, with uncouth\r\ncarvings of centaurs and monsters on its architrave, belongs to this\r\nsame period. The +Temple of Zeus+ at +Agrigentum+ (Fig. 33) is another\r\nsingular and exceptional design, and was the second of the five colossal\r\ntemples mentioned above. The pteroma was entirely enclosed by walls with\r\nengaged columns showing externally, and was of extraordinary width. The\r\nwalls of the narrow cella were interrupted by heavy piers supporting\r\natlantes, or applied statues under the ceiling. There seem to have been\r\nwindows between these figures, but it is not clear whence they borrowed\r\ntheir light, unless it was admitted by the omission of the metopes\r\nbetween the external triglyphs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 33.--TEMPLE OF ZEUS. AGRIGENTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE TRANSITION.+ During the transitional period there was a marked\r\nimprovement in the proportions, detail, and workmanship of the temples.\r\nThe cella was made broader, the columns more slender, the entablature\r\nlighter. The triglyphs disappeared from the cella wall, and sculpture of\r\na higher order enhanced the architectural effect. The profiles of the\r\nmouldings and especially of the capitals became more subtle and refined\r\nin their curves, while the development of the Ionic order in important\r\nmonuments in Asia Minor was preparing the way for the splendors of the\r\nPericlean age. Three temples especially deserve notice: the +Athena\r\nTemple+ on the island of +Ægina+, the +Temple of Zeus+ at +Olympia+, and\r\nthe so-called +Theseum+--perhaps a temple of Heracles--in Athens. They\r\nbelong to the period 470-450 B.C.; they are all hexastyle and\r\nperipteral, and without triglyphs on the cella wall. Of the three the\r\nsecond in the list is interesting as the scene of those rites which\r\npreceded and accompanied the Panhellenic Olympian games, and as the\r\ncentral feature of the Altis, the most complete temple-group and\r\nenclosure among all Greek remains. It was built of a coarse\r\nconglomerate, finished with fine stucco, and embellished with sculpture\r\nby the greatest masters of the time. The adjacent +Heraion+ (temple of\r\nHera) was a highly venerated and ancient shrine, originally built with\r\nwooden columns which, according to Pausanias, were replaced one by one,\r\nas they decayed, by stone columns. The truth of this statement is\r\nattested by the discovery of a singular variety of capitals among its\r\nruins, corresponding to the various periods at which they were added.\r\nThe Theseum is the most perfectly preserved of all Greek temples, and in\r\nthe refinement of its forms is only surpassed by those of the Periclean\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 34.--RUINS OF THE PARTHENON.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 35.--PLAN OF ERECHTHEUM.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 36.--WEST END OF ERECHTHEUM, RESTORED.]\r\n\r\n+THE PERICLEAN AGE.+ The Persian wars may be taken as the dividing line\r\nbetween the Transition period and the Periclean age. The _élan_ of\r\nnational enthusiasm that followed the expulsion of the invader, and the\r\nglory and wealth which accrued to Athens as the champion of all Hellas,\r\nresulted in a splendid reconstruction of the Attic monuments as well as\r\na revival of building activity in Asia Minor. By the wise administration\r\nof Pericles and by the genius of Ictinus, Phidias, and other artists of\r\nsurpassing skill, the Acropolis at Athens was crowned with a group of\r\nbuildings and statues absolutely unrivalled. Chief among them was the\r\n+Parthenon+, the shrine of Athena Parthenos, which the critics of all\r\nschools have agreed in considering the most faultless in design and\r\nexecution of all buildings erected by man (Figs. 31, 34, and\r\nFrontispiece). It was an octastyle peripteral temple, with seventeen\r\ncolumns on the side, and measured 220 by 100 feet on the top of the\r\nstylobate. It was the work of Ictinus and Callicrates, built to enshrine\r\nthe noble statue of the goddess by Phidias, a standing chryselephantine\r\nfigure forty feet high. It was the masterpiece of Greek architecture not\r\nonly by reason of its refinements of detail, but also on account of the\r\nbeauty of its sculptural adornments. The frieze about the cella wall\r\nunder the pteroma ceiling, representing in low relief with masterly\r\nskill the Panathenaic procession; the sculptured groups in the metopes,\r\nand the superb assemblages of Olympic and symbolic figures of colossal\r\nsize in the pediments, added their majesty to the perfection of the\r\narchitecture. Here also the horizontal curvatures and other refinements\r\nare found in their highest development. Northward from it, upon the\r\nAcropolis, stood the +Erechtheum+, an excellent example of the\r\nAttic-Ionic style (Figs. 35, 36). Its singular irregularities of plan\r\nand level, and the variety of its detail, exhibit in a striking way the\r\nGreek indifference to mere formal symmetry when confronted by practical\r\nconsiderations. The motive in this case was the desire to include in one\r\ndesign several existing and venerated shrines to Attic deities and\r\nheroes--Athena Polias, Poseidon, Pandrosus, Erechtheus, Boutes, etc.\r\nBegun by unknown architects in 479 B.C., and not completed until 408\r\nB.C., it remains in its ruin still one of the most interesting and\r\nattractive of ancient buildings. Its two colonnades of differing design,\r\nits beautiful north doorway, and the unique and noble caryatid porch or\r\nbalcony on the south side are unsurpassed in delicate beauty combined\r\nwith vigor of design.[11] A smaller monument of the Ionic order, the\r\namphiprostyle temple to +Nike Apteros+--the Wingless Victory--stands on\r\na projecting spur of the Acropolis to the southwest. It measures only 27\r\nfeet by 18 feet in plan; the cella is nearly square; the columns are\r\nsturdier than those of the Erechtheum, and the execution of the monument\r\nis admirable. It was the first completed of the extant buildings of the\r\ngroup of the Acropolis and dates from 466 B.C.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: See Appendix, p. 427.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 37.--PROPYLÆA AT ATHENS. PLAN.]\r\n\r\nIn the +Propylæa+ (Fig. 37), the monumental gateway to the Acropolis,\r\nthe Doric and Ionic orders appear to have been combined for the first\r\ntime (437 to 432 B.C.). It was the master work of Mnesicles. The front\r\nand rear façades were Doric hexastyles; adjoining the front porch were\r\ntwo projecting lateral wings employing a smaller Doric order. The\r\ncentral passageway led between two rows of Ionic columns to the rear\r\nporch, entered by five doorways and crowned, like the front, with a\r\npediment. The whole was executed with the same splendor and perfection\r\nas the other buildings of the Acropolis, and was a worthy gateway to the\r\ngroup of noble monuments which crowned that citadel of the Attic\r\ncapital. The two orders were also combined in the temple of +Apollo\r\nEpicurius+ at +Phigalæa+ (Bassæ). This temple was erected in 430 B.C. by\r\nIctinus, who used the Ionic order internally to decorate a row of\r\nprojecting piers instead of free-standing columns in the naos, in which\r\nthere was also a single Corinthian column of rather archaic design,\r\nwhich may have been used as a support for a statue or votive offering.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ALEXANDRIAN AGE.+ A period of reaction followed the splendid\r\narchitectural activity of the Periclean age. A succession of disastrous\r\nwars--the Sicilian, Peloponnesian, and Corinthian--drained the energies\r\nand destroyed the peace of European Greece for seventy-five years,\r\nrobbing Athens of her supremacy and inflicting wounds from which she\r\nnever recovered. In the latter part of the fourth century, however, the\r\ntriumph of the Macedonian empire over all the Mediterranean lands\r\ninaugurated a new era of architectural magnificence, especially in Asia\r\nMinor. The keynote of the art of this time was splendor, as that of the\r\npreceding age was artistic perfection. The Corinthian order came into\r\nuse, as though the Ionic were not rich enough for the sumptuous taste of\r\nthe time, and capitals and bases of novel and elaborate design\r\nembellished the Ionic temples of Asia Minor. In the temple of +Apollo\r\nDidymæus+ at Miletus, the plinths of the bases were made octagonal and\r\npanelled with rich scroll-carvings; and the piers which buttressed the\r\ninterior faces of the cella-walls were given capitals of singular but\r\nelegant form, midway between the Ionic and Corinthian types. This temple\r\nbelongs to the list of colossal edifices already referred to; its\r\ndimensions were 366 by 163 feet, making it the largest of them all. The\r\nfamous +Artemisium+ (temple of Artemis or Diana) measured 342 by 163\r\nfeet. Several of the columns of the latter were enriched with sculptured\r\nfigures encircling the lower drums of the colossal shafts. The most\r\nlavish expenditure was bestowed upon small structures, shrines, and\r\nsarcophagi. The graceful monument still visible in Athens, erected by\r\nthe choragus Lysicrates in token of his victory in the choral\r\ncompetitions, belongs to this period (330 B.C.). It is circular, with a\r\nslightly domical imbricated roof, and is decorated with elegant engaged\r\nCorinthian columns (Fig. 38). In the Imperial Museum at Constantinople\r\nare several sarcophagi of this period found at Sidon, but executed by\r\nGreek artists, and of exceptional beauty. They are in the form of\r\ntemples or shrines; the finest of them, supposed by some to have been\r\nmade for Alexander’s favorite general Perdiccas, and by others for the\r\nPersian satrap who figures prominently on its sculptured reliefs, is the\r\nmost sumptuous work of the kind in existence. The exquisite polychromy\r\nof its beautiful reliefs and the perfection of its rich details of\r\ncornice, pediment, tiling, and crestings, make it an exceedingly\r\ninteresting and instructive example of the minor architecture of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 38.--CHORAGIC MONUMENT OF LYSICRATES.\r\n  (Restored model, N.Y.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE DECADENCE.+ After the decline of Alexandrian magnificence Greek art\r\nnever recovered its ancient glory, but the flame was not suddenly\r\nextinguished. While in Greece proper the works of the second and third\r\ncenturies B.C., are for the most part weak and lifeless, like the +Stoa\r\nof Attalus+ (175 B.C.) and the +Tower of the Winds+ (the Clepsydra of\r\nAndronicus Cyrrhestes, 100 B.C.) at Athens or the Portico of Philip in\r\nDelos, there were still a few worthy works built in Asia Minor. The\r\nsplendid +Altar+ erected at +Pergamon+ by Eumenes II. (circ. 180 B.C.)\r\nin the Ionic order, combined sculpture of extraordinary vigor with\r\nimposing architecture in masterly fashion. At +Aizanoi+ an Ionic +Temple\r\nto Zeus+, by some attributed to the Roman period, but showing rather the\r\ncharacter of good late Greek work, deserves mention for its elegant\r\ndetails, and especially for its frieze-decoration of acanthus leaves and\r\nscrolls resembling those of a Corinthian capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 39.--TEMPLE OF OLYMPIAN ZEUS. ATHENS.]\r\n\r\n+ROMAN PERIOD.+ During this period, _i.e._, throughout the second and\r\nfirst centuries B.C., the Roman dominion was spreading over Greek\r\nterritory, and the structures erected subsequent to the conquest partake\r\nof the Roman character and mingle Roman conceptions with Greek details\r\nand _vice versâ_. The temple of the +Olympian Zeus+ at Athens (Fig. 39),\r\na mighty dipteral Corinthian edifice measuring 354 by 171 feet, standing\r\non a vast terrace or temenos surrounded by a buttressed wall, was begun\r\nby Antiochus Epiphanes (170 B.C.) on the site of an earlier unfinished\r\nDoric temple of the time of Pisistratus, and carried out under the\r\ndirection of the Roman architect, Cossutius. It was not, however,\r\nfinally completed until the time of Hadrian, 130 A.D. Meanwhile Sulla\r\nhad despoiled it of several columns[12] which he carried to Rome (86\r\nB.C.), to use in the rebuilding of the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol,\r\nwhere they undoubtedly served as models in the development of the Roman\r\nCorinthian order. The columns were 57 feet high, with capitals of the\r\nmost perfect Corinthian type; fifteen are now standing, and one lies\r\nprostrate near by. To the Roman period also belong the +Agora Gate+\r\n(circ. 35 B.C.), the +Arch of Hadrian+ (117 A.D.), the +Odeon of\r\nRegilla+ or of Herodes Atticus (143 A.D.), at Athens, and many temples\r\nand tombs, theatres, arches, etc., in the Greek provinces.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: L. Bevier, in _Papers of the American Classical\r\n    School at Athens_ (vol. i., pp. 195, 196), contends that these\r\n    were columns left from the old Doric temple. This is untenable,\r\n    for Sulla would certainly not have taken the trouble to carry\r\n    away archaic Doric columns, with such splendid Corinthian columns\r\n    before him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+SECULAR MONUMENTS; PROPYLÆA.+ The stately gateway by which the\r\nAcropolis was entered has already been described. It was the noblest and\r\nmost perfect of a class of buildings whose prototype is found in the\r\nmonumental columnar porches of the palace-group at Persepolis. The\r\nGreeks never used the arch in these structures, nor did they attach to\r\nthem the same importance as did most of the other nations of antiquity.\r\nThe Altis of Olympia, the national shrine of Hellenism, appears to have\r\nhad no central gateway of imposing size, but a number of insignificant\r\nentrances disposed at random. The +Propylæa+ of +Sunium+, +Priene+ and\r\n+Eleusis+ are the most conspicuous, after those of the Athenian\r\nAcropolis. Of these the Ionic gateway at Priene is the finest, although\r\nthe later of the two at Eleusis is interesting for its anta-capitals.\r\n(_Anta_ = a flat pilaster decorating the end of a wing-wall and treated\r\nwith a base and capital usually differing from those of the adjacent\r\ncolumns.) These are of Corinthian type, adorned with winged horses,\r\nscrolls, and anthemions of an exuberant richness of design,\r\ncharacteristic of this late period.\r\n\r\n\r\n+COLONNADES, STOÆ.+ These were built to connect public monuments (as the\r\nDionysiac theatre and Odeon at Athens); or along the sides of great\r\npublic squares, as at Assos and Olympia (the so-called +Echo Hall+); or\r\nas independent open public halls, as the +Stoa Diple+ at Thoricus. They\r\nafforded shelter from sun and rain, places for promenading, meetings\r\nwith friends, public gatherings, and similar purposes. They were rarely\r\nof great size, and most of them are of rather late date, though the\r\narchaic structure at Pæstum, known as the +Basilica+, was probably in\r\nreality an open hall of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 40.--PLAN OF GREEK THEATRE.\r\n  o, _Orchestra_; l, _Logeion_; p, _Paraskenai_; _s, s_, _Stoa_.]\r\n\r\n+THEATRES, ODEONS.+ These were invariably cut out of the rocky\r\nhillsides, though in a few cases (Mantinæa, Myra, Antiphellus) a part of\r\nthe seats were sustained by a built-up substructure and walls to eke out\r\nthe deficiency of the hill-slope under them. The front of the excavation\r\nwas enclosed by a stage and a set scene or background, built up so as to\r\nleave somewhat over a semicircle for the _orchestra_ or space enclosed\r\nby the lower tier of seats (Fig. 40). An altar to Dionysus (Bacchus) was\r\nthe essential feature in the foreground of the orchestra, where the\r\nDionysiac choral dance was performed. The seats formed successive steps\r\nof stone or marble sweeping around the sloping excavation, with carved\r\nmarble thrones for the priests, archons, and other dignitaries. The only\r\narchitectural decoration of the theatre was that of the set scene or\r\n_skene_, which with its wing-walls (_paraskenai_) enclosing the stage\r\n(_logeion_) was a permanent structure of stone or marble adorned with\r\ndoors, cornices, pilasters, etc. This has perished in nearly every case;\r\nbut at Aspendus, in Asia Minor, there is one still fairly well\r\npreserved, with a rich architectural decoration on its inner face. The\r\nextreme diameter of the theatres varied greatly; thus at Aizanoi it is\r\n187 feet, and at Syracuse 495 feet. The theatre of Dionysus at Athens\r\n(finished 325 B.C.) could accommodate thirty thousand spectators.\r\n\r\nThe odeon differed from the theatre principally in being smaller and\r\nentirely covered in by a wooden roof. The +Odeon of Regilla+, built by\r\nHerodes Atticus in Athens (143 A.D.), is a well-preserved specimen of\r\nthis class, but all traces of its cedar ceiling and of its intermediate\r\nsupports have disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n+BUILDINGS FOR ATHLETIC CONTESTS.+ These comprised stadia and\r\nhippodromes for races, and gymnasia and palæstræ for individual\r\nexercise, bathing, and amusement. The _stadia_ and _hippodromes_ were\r\noblong enclosures surrounded by tiers of seats and without conspicuous\r\narchitectural features. The _palæstra_ or _gymnasium_--for the terms are\r\nnot clearly distinguished--was a combination of courts, chambers, tanks\r\n(_piscinæ_) for bathers and _exedræ_ or semicircular recesses provided\r\nwith tiers of seats for spectators and auditors, destined not merely for\r\nthe exercises of athletes preparing for the stadium, but also for the\r\ninstruction and diversion of the public by recitations, lectures, and\r\ndiscussions. It was the prototype of the Roman thermæ, but less\r\nimposing, more simple in plan and adornment. Every Greek city had one or\r\nmore of them, but they have almost wholly disappeared, and the brief\r\ndescription by Vitruvius and scanty remains at Alexandria Troas and\r\nEphesus furnish almost the only information we possess regarding their\r\nform and arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n+TOMBS.+ These are not numerous, and the most important are found in\r\nAsia Minor. The greatest of these is the famed +Mausoleum+ at\r\nHalicarnassus in Caria, the monument erected to the king Mausolus by his\r\nwidow Artemisia (354 B.C.; Fig. 41). It was designed by Satyrus and\r\nPythius in the Ionic style, and comprised a podium or base 50 feet high\r\nand measuring 80 feet by 100 feet, in which was the sepulchre. Upon this\r\nbase stood a cella surrounded by thirty-six Ionic columns; and crowned\r\nby a pyramidal roof, on the peak of which was a colossal marble quadriga\r\nat a height of 130 feet. It was superbly decorated by Scopas and other\r\ngreat sculptors with statues, marble lions, and a magnificent frieze.\r\nThe British Museum possesses fragments of this most imposing monument.\r\nAt Xanthus the +Nereid Monument+, so called from its sculptured figures\r\nof Nereides, was a somewhat similar design on a smaller scale, with\r\nsixteen Ionic columns. At Mylassa was another tomb with an open\r\nCorinthian colonnade supporting a roof formed in a stepped pyramid. Some\r\nof the later rock-cut tombs of Lycia at Myra and Antiphellus may also be\r\ncounted as Hellenic works.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 41.--MAUSOLEUM AT HALICARNASSUS.\r\n  (As restored by the author.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n+DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.+ This never attained great importance in Greece,\r\nand our knowledge of the typical Greek house is principally derived from\r\nliterary sources. Very few remains of Greek houses have been found\r\nsufficiently well preserved to permit of restoring even the plan. It is\r\nprobable that they resembled in general arrangement the houses of\r\nPompeii (see p. 107); but that they were generally insignificant in size\r\nand decoration. The exterior walls were pierced only by the entrance\r\ndoors, all light being derived from one or more interior courts. In the\r\nMacedonian epoch there must have been greater display and luxury in\r\ndomestic architecture, but no remains have come down to us of sufficient\r\nimportance or completeness to warrant further discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS.+ In addition to those already mentioned in the text\r\n  the following should be enumerated:\r\n\r\n  PREHISTORIC PERIOD. In the Islands about Santorin, remains of\r\n  houses antedating 1500 B.C.; at Tiryns the Acropolis, walls, and\r\n  miscellaneous ruins; the like also at Mycenæ, besides various\r\n  tombs; walls and gates at Samos, Thoricus, Menidi, Athens, etc.\r\n\r\n  ARCHAIC PERIOD. Doric Temples at Metapontium (by Durm assigned to\r\n  610 B.C.), Selinus, Agrigentum, Pæstum; at Athens the first\r\n  Parthenon; in Asia Minor the primitive Ionic Artemisium at Ephesus\r\n  and the Heraion at Samos, the latter the oldest of colossal Greek\r\n  temples.\r\n\r\n  TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. At Agrigentum, temples of Concord, Castor and\r\n  Pollux, Demeter, Æsculapius, all circ. 480 B.C.; temples at\r\n  Selinus and Segesta.\r\n\r\n  PERICLEAN PERIOD. In Athens the Ionic temple on the Illissus,\r\n  destroyed during the present century; on Cape Sunium the temple of\r\n  Athena, 430 B.C., partly standing; at Nemea, the temple of Zeus;\r\n  at Tegea, the temple of Athena Elea (400? B.C.); at Rhamnus, the\r\n  temples of Themis and of Nemesis; at Argos, two temples, stoa, and\r\n  other buildings; all these were Doric.\r\n\r\n  ALEXANDRIAN PERIOD. The temple of Dionysus at Teos; temple of\r\n  Artemis Leucophryne at Magnesia, both about 330 B.C. and of the\r\n  Ionic order.\r\n\r\n  DECADENCE AND ROMAN PERIOD. At Athens the Stoa of Eumenes, circ.\r\n  170 B.C.; the monument of Philopappus on the Museum hill, 110\r\n  A.D.; the Gymnasium of Hadrian, 114 to 137 A.D.; the last two of\r\n  the Corinthian order.\r\n\r\n  THEATRES. Besides those already mentioned there are important\r\n  remains of theatres at Epidaurus, Argos, Segesta, Iassus (400?\r\n  B.C.), Delos, Sicyon, and Thoricus; at Aizanoi, Myra, Telmissus,\r\n  and Patara, besides many others of less importance scattered\r\n  through the Hellenic world. At Taormina are extensive ruins of a\r\n  large Greek theatre rebuilt in the Roman period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nROMAN ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: As before, Anderson and Spiers, Baumeister,\r\n  Reber.

A scarcity of good harbors was the\r\nonly drawback amid the blessings of a glorious climate, fertile soil,\r\nvaried scenery, and rich material resources. From a remote antiquity\r\nDorian colonists had occupied the southern portion and the island of\r\nSicily, enriching them with splendid monuments of Doric art; and\r\nPhœnician commerce had brought thither the products of Oriental art and\r\nindustry. The foundation of Rome in 753 B.C. established the nucleus\r\nabout which the sundry populations of Italy were to crystallize into the\r\nRoman nation, under the dominating influence of the Latin element. Later\r\non, the absorption of the conquered Etruscans added to this composite\r\npeople a race of builders and engineers, as yet rude and uncouth in\r\ntheir art, but destined to become a powerful factor in developing the\r\nnew architecture that was to spring from the contact of the practical\r\nRomans with the noble art of the Greek centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n+GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS.+ While the Greeks bequeathed to posterity the\r\nmost perfect models of form in literary and plastic art, it was reserved\r\nfor the Romans to work out the applications of these to every-day\r\nmaterial life. The Romans were above all things a practical people.\r\nTheir consummate skill as organizers is manifest in the marvellous\r\nadministrative institutions of their government, under which they united\r\nthe most distant and diverse nationalities. Seemingly deficient in\r\nculture, they were yet able to recast the forms of Greek architecture in\r\nnew moulds, and to evolve therefrom a mighty architecture adapted to\r\nwholly novel conditions. They brought engineering into the service of\r\narchitecture, which they fitted to the varied requirements of\r\ngovernment, public amusement, private luxury, and the common comfort.\r\nThey covered the antique world with arches and amphitheatres, with\r\nvillas, baths, basilicas, and temples, all bearing the unmistakable\r\nimpress of Rome, though wrought by artists and artisans of divers races.\r\nOnly an extraordinary genius for organization could have accomplished\r\nsuch results.\r\n\r\nThe architects of Rome marvellously extended the range of their art, and\r\ngave it a flexibility by which it accommodated itself to the widest\r\nvariety of materials and conditions. They made the arch and vault the\r\nbasis of their system of design, employing them on a scale previously\r\nundreamed of, and in combinations of surpassing richness and majesty.\r\nThey systematized their methods of construction so that soldiers and\r\nbarbarians could execute the rough mass of their buildings, and\r\nformulated the designing of the decorative details so that artisans of\r\nmoderate skill could execute them with good effect. They carried the\r\nprinciple of repetition of motives to its utmost limit, and sought to\r\ncounteract any resulting monotony by the scale and splendor of the\r\ndesign. Above all they developed planning into a fine art, displaying\r\ntheir genius in a wonderful variety of combinations and in an unfailing\r\nsense of the demands of constructive propriety, practical convenience,\r\nand artistic effect. Where Egyptian or Greek architecture shows one type\r\nof plan, the Roman shows a score.\r\n\r\n\r\n+GREEK INFLUENCE.+ Previous to the closing years of the Republic the\r\nRomans had no art but the Etruscan. The few buildings of importance they\r\npossessed were of Etruscan design and workmanship, excepting a small\r\nnumber built by Greek hands. It was not until the Empire that Roman\r\narchitecture took on a truly national form. True Roman architecture is\r\nessentially imperial. The change from the primitive Etruscan style to\r\nthe splendors of the imperial age was due to the conquest of the Greek\r\nstates. Not only did the Greek campaigns enrich Rome with an\r\nunprecedented wealth of artistic spoils; they also brought into Italy\r\nhosts of Greek artists, and filled the minds of the campaigners with the\r\nambition to realize in their own dominions the marble colonnades, the\r\ntemples, theatres, and propylæa of the Greek cities they had pillaged.\r\nThe Greek orders were adopted, altered, and applied to arcaded designs\r\nas well as to peristyles and other open colonnades. The marriage of the\r\ncolumn and arch gave birth to a system of forms as characteristic of\r\nRoman architecture as the Doric or Ionic colonnade is of the Greek.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE ROMAN ORDERS.+ To meet the demands of Roman taste the Etruscan\r\ncolumn was retained with its simple entablature; the Doric and Ionic\r\nwere adopted in a modified form; the Corinthian was developed into a\r\ncomplete and independent order, and the Composite was added to the list.\r\nA regular system of proportions for all these five orders was gradually\r\nevolved, and the mouldings were profiled with arcs of circles instead of\r\nthe subtler Greek curves. In the building of many-storied structures the\r\norders were superposed, the more slender over the sturdier, in an\r\norderly and graded succession. The immense extent and number of the\r\nRoman buildings, the coarse materials often used, the relative scarcity\r\nof highly trained artisans, and above all, the necessity of making a\r\ngiven amount of artistic design serve for the largest possible amount of\r\narchitecture, combined to direct the designing of detail into uniform\r\nchannels. Thus in time was established a sort of canon of proportions,\r\nwhich was reduced to rules by Vitruvius, and revived in much more\r\ndetailed and precise form by Vignola in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 42.--ROMAN DORIC ORDER.\r\n  (THEATRE OF MARCELLUS).]\r\n\r\nIn each of the orders, including the Doric, the column was given a base\r\none half of a diameter in height (the unit of measurement being the\r\ndiameter of the lower part of the shaft, the _crassitudo_ of Vitruvius).\r\nThe shaft was made to contract about one-sixth in diameter toward the\r\ncapital, under which it was terminated by an _astragal_ or collar of\r\nsmall mouldings; at the base it ended in a slight flare and fillet\r\ncalled the _cincture_. The entablature was in all cases given not far\r\nfrom one quarter the height of the whole column. The +Tuscan+ order was\r\na rudimentary or Etruscan Doric with a column seven diameters high and a\r\nsimple entablature without triglyphs, mutules, or dentils. But few\r\nexamples of its use are known. The +Doric+ (Fig. 42) retained the\r\ntriglyphs and metopes, the mutules and guttæ of the Greek; but the\r\ncolumn was made eight diameters high, the shaft was smooth or had deep\r\nflutings separated by narrow fillets, and was usually provided with a\r\nsimple moulded base on a square plinth. Mutules were used only over the\r\ntriglyphs, and were even replaced in some cases by dentils; the corona\r\nwas made lighter than the Greek, and a cymatium replaced the antefixæ on\r\nthe lateral cornices. The Ionic underwent fewer changes, and these\r\nprincipally in the smaller mouldings and details of the capital. The\r\ncolumn was nine diameters high (Fig. 43). The +Corinthian+ was made into\r\nan independent order by the designing of a special base of small _tori_\r\nand _scotiæ_, and by sumptuously carved _modillions_ or brackets\r\nenriching the cornice and supporting the corona above a denticulated\r\nbed-mould (Fig. 44). Though the first designers of the modillion were\r\nprobably Greeks, it must, nevertheless, be taken as really a Roman\r\ndevice, worthily completing the essentially Roman Corinthian order. The\r\n+Composite+ was formed by combining into one capital portions of the\r\nIonic and Corinthian, and giving to it a simplified form of the\r\nCorinthian cornice. The Corinthian order remained, however, the favorite\r\norder of Roman architecture.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 43.--ROMAN IONIC ORDER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+USE OF THE ORDERS.+ The Romans introduced many innovations in the\r\ngeneral use and treatment of the orders. Monolithic shafts were\r\npreferred to those built up of superposed drums. The fluting was omitted\r\non these, and when hard and semi-precious stone like porphyry or\r\nverd-antique was the material, it was highly polished to bring out its\r\ncolor. These polished monoliths were often of great size, and they were\r\nused in almost incredible numbers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 44.--CORINTHIAN ORDER\r\n  (TEMPLE OF CASTOR AND POLLUX).]\r\n\r\nAnother radical departure from Greek usage was the mounting of columns\r\non pedestals to secure greater height without increasing the size of the\r\ncolumn and its entablature. The Greek _anta_ was developed into the\r\nRoman pilaster or flattened wall-column, and every free column, or range\r\nof columns perpendicular to the façade, had its corresponding pilaster\r\nto support the wall-end of the architrave. But the most radical\r\ninnovation was the general use of engaged columns as wall-decorations or\r\nbuttresses. The engaged column projected from the wall by more than half\r\nits diameter, and was built up with the wall as a part of its substance\r\n(Fig. 45). The entablature was in many cases advanced only over the\r\ncolumns, between which it was set back almost to the plane of the wall.\r\nThis practice is open to the obvious criticism that it makes the column\r\nappear superfluous by depriving it of its function of supporting the\r\ncontinuous entablature. The objection has less weight when the\r\nprojecting entablature over the column serves as a pedestal for a statue\r\nor similar object, which restores to the column its function as a\r\nsupport (see the Arch of Constantine, Fig. 63).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 45.--ROMAN ARCADE WITH ENGAGED COLUMNS\r\n  (From the Colosseum.)]\r\n\r\n+ARCADES.+ The orders, though probably at first used only as free\r\nsupports in porticos and colonnades, were early applied as decorations\r\nto arcaded structures. This practice became general with the\r\nmultiplication of many-storied arcades like those of the amphitheatres,\r\nthe engaged columns being set between the arches as buttresses,\r\nsupporting entablatures which marked the divisions into stories (Fig.\r\n45). This combination has been assailed as a false and illogical device,\r\nbut the criticism proceeds from a too narrow conception of architectural\r\npropriety. It is defensible upon both artistic and logical grounds; for\r\nit not only furnishes a most desirable play of light and shade and a\r\npleasing contrast of rectangular and curved lines, but by emphasizing\r\nthe constructive divisions and elements of the building and the vertical\r\nsupport of the piers, it also contributes to the expressiveness and\r\nvigor of the design.\r\n\r\n\r\n+VAULTING.+ The Romans substituted vaulting in brick, concrete, or\r\nmasonry for wooden ceilings wherever possible, both in public and\r\nprivate edifices. The Etruscans were the first vault-builders, and the\r\nCloaca Maxima, the great sewer of Republican Rome (about 500 B.C.) still\r\nremains as a monument of their engineering skill. Probably not only\r\nEtruscan engineers (whose traditions were perhaps derived from Asiatic\r\nsources in the remote past), but Asiatic builders also from conquered\r\neastern provinces, were engaged together in the development of the\r\nwonderful system of vaulted construction to which Roman architecture so\r\nlargely owed its grandeur. Three types of vault were commonly used: the\r\nbarrel-vault, the groined or four-part vault, and the dome.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 46.--BARREL VAULT.]\r\n\r\nThe barrel vault (Fig. 46) was generally semi-cylindrical in section,\r\nand was used to cover corridors and oblong halls, like the\r\ntemple-cellas, or was bent around a curve, as in amphitheatre passages.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 47.--GROINED VAULT.\r\n  _g, g_, _Groins._]\r\n\r\nThe groined vault is formed by the intersection of two barrel-vaults\r\n(Fig. 47). When several compartments of groined vaulting are placed\r\ntogether over an oblong plan, a double advantage is secured. Lateral\r\nwindows can be carried up to the full height of the vaulting instead of\r\nbeing stopped below its springing; and the weight and thrust of the\r\nvaulting are concentrated upon a number of isolated points instead of\r\nbeing exerted along the whole extent of the side walls, as with the\r\nbarrel-vault. The Romans saw that it was sufficient to dispose the\r\nmasonry at these points in masses at right angles to the length of the\r\nhall, to best resist the lateral thrust of the vault. This appears\r\nclearly in the plan of the Basilica of Constantine (Fig. 58).\r\n\r\nThe dome was in almost all Roman examples supported on a circular wall\r\nbuilt up from the ground, as in the Pantheon (Fig. 54). The pendentive\r\ndome, sustained by four or eight arches over a square or octagonal plan,\r\nis not found in true Roman buildings.\r\n\r\nThe Romans made of the vault something more than a mere constructive\r\ndevice. It became in their hands an element of interior effect at least\r\nequally important with the arch and column. No style of architecture has\r\never evolved nobler forms of ceiling than the groined vault and the\r\ndome. Moreover, the use of vaulting made possible effects of\r\nunencumbered spaciousness and amplitude which could never be compassed\r\nby any combination of piers and columns. It also assured to the Roman\r\nmonuments a duration and a freedom from danger of destruction by fire\r\nimpossible with any wooden-roofed architecture, however noble its form\r\nor careful its execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CONSTRUCTION.+ The constructive methods of the Romans varied with the\r\nconditions and resources of different provinces, but were everywhere\r\ndominated by the same practical spirit. Their vaulted architecture\r\ndemanded for the support of its enormous weights and for resistance to\r\nits disruptive thrusts, piers and buttresses of great mass. To construct\r\nthese wholly of cut stone appeared preposterous and wasteful to the\r\nRoman. Italy abounds in clay, lime, and a volcanic product, _pozzolana_\r\n(from Puteoli or Pozzuoli, where it has always been obtained in large\r\nquantities), which makes an admirable hydraulic cement. With these\r\nmaterials it was possible to employ unskilled labor for the great bulk\r\nof this massive masonry, and to erect with the greatest rapidity and in\r\nthe most economical manner those stupendous piles which, even in their\r\nruin, excite the admiration of every beholder.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 48.--ROMAN WALL MASONRY.\r\n  a, _Brickwork_; b, _Tufa ashlar_; r, _Opus reticulatum_;\r\n  i, _Opus incertum_.]\r\n\r\n+STONE, CONCRETE, AND BRICK MASONRY.+ For buildings of an externally\r\ndecorative character such as temples, arches of triumph, and\r\namphitheatres, as well as in all places where brick and concrete were\r\nnot easily obtained, stone was employed. The walls were built by laying\r\nup the inner and outer faces in _ashlar_ or cut stone, and filling in\r\nthe intermediate space with rubble (random masonry of uncut stone) laid\r\nup in cement, or with concrete of broken stone and cement dumped into\r\nthe space in successive layers. The cement converted the whole into a\r\nconglomerate closely united with the face-masonry. In Syria and Egypt\r\nthe local preference for stones of enormous size was gratified, and even\r\nsurpassed, as in Herod’s terrace-walls for the temple at Jerusalem\r\n(p. 41), and in the splendid structures of Palmyra and Baalbec. In\r\nItaly, however, stones of moderate size were preferred, and when blocks\r\nof unusual dimensions occur, they are in many cases marked with false\r\njoints, dividing them into apparently smaller blocks, lest they should\r\ndwarf the building by their large scale. The general use in the Augustan\r\nperiod of marble for a decorative lining or wainscot in interiors led in\r\ntime to the objectionable practice of coating buildings of concrete with\r\nan apparel of sham marble masonry, by carving false joints upon an\r\nexternal veneer of thin slabs of that material. Ordinary concrete walls\r\nwere frequently faced with small blocks of tufa, called, according to\r\nthe manner of its application, _opus reticulatum_, _opus incertum_,\r\n_opus spicatum_, etc. (Fig. 48). In most cases, however, the facing was\r\nof carefully executed brickwork, covered sometimes by a coating of\r\nstucco. The bricks were large, measuring from one to two feet square\r\nwhere used for quoins or arches, but triangular where they served only\r\nas facings. Bricks were also used in the construction of skeleton ribs\r\nfor concrete vaults of large span.\r\n\r\n\r\n+VAULTING.+ Here, as in the wall-masonry, economy and common sense\r\ndevised methods extremely simple for accomplishing vast designs. While\r\nthe smaller vaults were, so to speak, cast in concrete upon moulds made\r\nof rough boards, the enormous weight of the larger vaults precluded\r\ntheir being supported, while drying or “setting,” upon timber centrings\r\nbuilt up from the ground. Accordingly, a skeleton of light ribs was\r\nfirst built on wooden centrings, and these ribs, when firmly “set,”\r\nbecame themselves supports for intermediate centrings on which to cast\r\nthe concrete fillings between the ribs. The whole vault, once hardened,\r\nformed really a monolithic curved lintel, exerting no thrust whatever,\r\nso that the extraordinary precautions against lateral disruption\r\npractised by the Romans were, in fact, in many cases quite superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n+DECORATION.+ The temple of Castor and Pollux in the Forum (long\r\nmiscalled the temple of Jupiter Stator), is a typical example of Roman\r\narchitectural decoration, in which richness was preferred to the subtler\r\nrefinements of design (see Fig. 44). The splendid figure-sculpture which\r\nadorned the Greek monuments would have been inappropriate on the\r\ntheatres and thermæ of Rome or the provinces, even had there been the\r\ntaste or the skill to produce it. Conventional carved ornament was\r\nsubstituted in its place, and developed into a splendid system of highly\r\ndecorative forms. Two principal elements appear in this decoration--the\r\nacanthus-leaf, as the basis of a whole series of wonderfully varied\r\nmotives; and symbolism, represented principally by what are technically\r\ntermed _grotesques_--incongruous combinations of natural forms, as when\r\nan infant’s body terminates in a bunch of foliage (Fig. 49). Only to a\r\nlimited extent do we find true sculpture employed as decoration, and\r\nthat mainly for triumphal arches or memorial columns.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 49--ROMAN CARVED ORNAMENT.\r\n  (Lateran Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe architectural mouldings were nearly always carved, the Greek\r\nwater-leaf and egg-and-dart forming the basis of most of the\r\nenrichments; but these were greatly elaborated and treated with more\r\nminute detail than the Greek prototypes. Friezes and bands were commonly\r\nornamented with the foliated scroll or _rinceau_ (a convenient French\r\nterm for which we have no equivalent). This motive was as characteristic\r\nof Roman art as the anthemion was of the Greek. It consists of a\r\ncontinuous stem throwing out alternately on either side branches which\r\ncurl into spirals and are richly adorned with rosettes, acanthus-leaves,\r\nscrolls, tendrils, and blossoms. In the best examples the detail was\r\nmodelled with great care and minuteness, and the motive itself was\r\ntreated with extraordinary variety and fertility of invention. A derived\r\nand enriched form of the anthemion was sometimes used for bands and\r\nfriezes; and grotesques, dolphins, griffins, infant genii, wreaths,\r\nfestoons, ribbons, eagles, and masks are also common features in Roman\r\nrelief carving.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 50.--ROMAN CEILING PANELS.\r\n  (a, From Palmyra; b, Basilica of Constantine.)]\r\n\r\nThe Romans made great use of panelling and of moulded plaster in their\r\ninterior decoration, especially for ceilings. The panelling of domes and\r\nvaults was usually roughly shaped in their first construction and\r\nfinished afterward in stucco with rich moulding and rosettes. The panels\r\nwere not always square or rectangular, as in Greek ceilings, but of\r\nvarious geometric forms in pleasing combinations (Fig. 50). In works of\r\na small scale the panels and decorations were wrought in relief in a\r\nheavy coating of plaster applied to the finished structure, and these\r\nstucco reliefs are among the most refined and charming products of Roman\r\nart. (Baths of Titus; Baths at Pompeii; Palace of the Cæsars and tombs\r\nat Rome.)\r\n\r\n\r\n+COLOR DECORATION.+ Plaster was also used as a ground for painting,\r\nexecuted in distemper or by the encaustic process, wax liquefied by a\r\nhot iron being the medium for applying the color in the latter case.\r\nPompeii and Herculaneum furnish countless examples of brilliant\r\nwall-painting in which strong primary colors form the ground, and a\r\nsemi-naturalistic, semi-fantastic representation of figures,\r\narchitecture and landscape is mingled with festoons, vines, and purely\r\nconventional ornament. Mosaic was also employed to decorate floors and\r\nwall-spaces, and sometimes for ceilings.[13] The later imperial baths\r\nand palaces were especially rich in mosaic of the kind called opus\r\nGrecanicum, executed with numberless minute cubes of stone or glass, as\r\nin the Baths of Caracalla and the Villa of Hadrian at Tivoli.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: See Van Dyke’s _History of Paintings_, p. 33.]\r\n\r\nTo the walls of monumental interiors, such as temples, basilicas, and\r\nthermæ, splendor of color was given by veneering them with thin slabs of\r\nrare and richly colored marble. No limit seems to have been placed upon\r\nthe costliness or amount of these precious materials. Byzantine\r\narchitecture borrowed from this practice its system of interior color\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nROMAN ARCHITECTURE--_Continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: Same as for Chapter VIII.

Its monuments, consisting\r\nmainly of city walls, tombs, and temples, are all marked by a general\r\nuncouthness of detail, denoting a lack of artistic refinement, but they\r\ndisplay considerable constructive skill. In the Etruscan walls we meet\r\nwith both polygonal and regularly coursed masonry; in both kinds the\r\ntrue arch appears as the almost universal form for gates and openings.\r\nA famous example is the Augustan Gate at Perugia, a late work rebuilt\r\nabout 40 B.C., but thoroughly Etruscan in style. At Volaterræ (Volterra)\r\nis another arched gate, and in Perugia fragments of still another appear\r\nbuilt into the modern walls.\r\n\r\nThe Etruscans built both structural and excavated tombs; they consisted\r\nin general of a single chamber with a slightly arched or gabled roof,\r\nsupported in the larger tombs on heavy square piers. The interiors were\r\ncovered with pictures; externally there was little ornament except about\r\nthe gable and doorway. The latter had a stepped or moulded frame with\r\ncurious _crossettes_ or ears projecting laterally at the top. The gable\r\nrecalled the wooden roofs of Etruscan temples, but was coarse in detail,\r\nespecially in its mouldings. Sepulchral monuments of other types are\r\nalso met with, such as _cippi_ or memorial pillars, sometimes in groups\r\nof five on a single pedestal (tomb at Albano).\r\n\r\nAmong the temples of Etruscan style that of +Jupiter Capitolinus+ on the\r\nCapitol at Rome, destroyed by fire in 80 B.C., was the chief. Three\r\nnarrow chambers side by side formed a cella nearly square in plan,\r\npreceded by a hexastyle porch of huge Doric, or rather Tuscan, columns\r\narranged in three aisles, widely spaced and carrying ponderous wooden\r\narchitraves. The roof was of wood; the cymatium and ornaments, as well\r\nas the statues in the pediment, were of terra-cotta, painted and gilded.\r\nThe details in general showed acquaintance with Greek models, which\r\nappeared in debased and awkward imitations of triglyphs, cornices,\r\nantefixæ, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 51.--TEMPLE FORTUNA VIRILIS. PLAN.]\r\n\r\n+GREEK STYLE.+ The victories of Marcellus at Syracuse, 212 B.C., Fabius\r\nMaximus at Tarentum (209 B.C.), Flaminius (196 B.C.), Mummius (146\r\nB.C.), Sulla (86 B.C.), and others in the various Greek provinces,\r\nsteadily increased the vogue of Greek architecture and the number of\r\nGreek artists in Rome. The temples of the last two centuries B.C., and\r\nsome of earlier date, though still Etruscan in plan, were in many cases\r\nstrongly Greek in the character of their details. A few have remained to\r\nour time in tolerable preservation. The temple of +Fortuna Virilis+\r\n(really of Fors Fortuna), of the second century (?) B.C., is a\r\ntetrastyle prostyle pseudoperipteral temple with a high _podium_ or\r\nbase, a typical Etruscan cella, and a deep porch, now walled up, but\r\nthoroughly Greek in the elegant details of its Ionic order (Fig. 51).\r\nTwo circular temples, both called erroneously +Temples of Vesta+, one at\r\nRome near the Cloaca Maxima, the other at Tivoli, belong among the\r\nmonuments of Greek style. The first was probably dedicated to Hercules,\r\nthe second probably to the Sibyls; the latter being much the better\r\npreserved of the two. Both were surrounded by peristyles of eighteen\r\nCorinthian columns, and probably covered by domical roofs with gilded\r\nbronze tiles. The Corinthian order appears here complete with its\r\nmodillion cornice, but the crispness of the detail and the fineness of\r\nthe execution are Greek and not Roman. These temples date from about 72\r\nB.C., though the one at Rome was probably rebuilt in the first century\r\nA.D. (Fig. 52).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 52.--CIRCULAR TEMPLE. TIVOLI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+IMPERIAL ARCHITECTURE; AUGUSTAN AGE.+ Even in the temples of Greek\r\nstyle Roman conceptions of plan and composition are dominant. The Greek\r\narchitect was not free to reproduce textually Greek designs or details,\r\nhowever strongly he might impress with the Greek character whatever he\r\ntouched. The demands of imperial splendor and the building of great\r\nedifices of varied form and complex structure, like the thermæ and\r\namphitheatres, called for new adaptations and combinations of planning\r\nand engineering. The reign of Augustus (27 B.C.-14 A.D.) inaugurated the\r\nimperial epoch, but many works erected before and after his reign\r\nproperly belong to the Augustan age by right of style. In general, we\r\nfind in the works of this period the happiest combination of Greek\r\nrefinement with Roman splendor. It was in this period that Rome first\r\nassumed the aspect of an opulent and splendid metropolis, though the way\r\nhad been prepared for this by the regularization and adornment of the\r\nRoman Forum and the erection of many temples, basilicas, fora, arches,\r\nand theatres during the generation preceding the accession of Augustus.\r\nHis reign saw the inception or completion of the portico of Octavia, the\r\nAugustan forum, the Septa Julia, the first Pantheon, the adjoining\r\nThermæ of Agrippa, the theatre of Marcellus, the first of the imperial\r\npalaces on the Palatine, and a long list of temples, including those of\r\nthe Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux), of Mars Ultor, of Jupiter Tonans on\r\nthe Capitol, and others in the provinces; besides colonnades, statues,\r\narches, and other embellishments almost without number.\r\n\r\n\r\n+LATER IMPERIAL WORKS.+ With the successors of Augustus splendor\r\nincreased to almost fabulous limits, as, for instance, in the vast\r\nextent and the prodigality of ivory and gold in the famous Golden House\r\nof Nero. After the great fire in Rome, presumably kindled by the agents\r\nof this emperor, a more regular and monumental system of street-planning\r\nand building was introduced, and the first municipal building-law was\r\ndecreed by him. To the reign of Vespasian (68-79 A.D.) we owe the\r\nrebuilding in Roman style and with the Corinthian order of the temple of\r\nJupiter Capitolinus, the Baths of Titus, and the beginning of the\r\nFlavian amphitheatre or Colosseum. The two last-named edifices both\r\nstood on the site of Nero’s Golden House, of which the greater part was\r\ndemolished to make way for them. During the last years of the first\r\ncentury the arch of Titus was erected, the Colosseum finished,\r\namphitheatres built at Verona, Pola, Reggio, Tusculum, Nîmes (France),\r\nConstantine (Algiers), Pompeii and Herculanum (these last two cities and\r\nStabiæ rebuilt after the earthquake of 63 A.D.), and arches, bridges,\r\nand temples erected all over the Roman world.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the second century was distinguished by the splendid\r\narchitectural achievements of the reign of Hadrian (117-138 A.D.) in\r\nRome and the provinces, especially Athens. Nearly all his works were\r\nmarked by great dignity of conception as well as beauty of detail.\r\nDuring the latter part of the century a very interesting series of\r\nbuildings were erected in the Hauran (Syria), in which Greek and Arab\r\nworkmen under Roman direction produced examples of vigorous stone\r\narchitecture of a mingled Roman and Syrian character.\r\n\r\nThe most-remarkable thermæ of Rome belong to the third century--those of\r\nCaracalla (211-217 A.D.) and of Diocletian (284-305 A.D.)--their ruins\r\nto-day ranking among the most imposing remains of antiquity. In Syria\r\nthe temples of the Sun at Baalbec and Palmyra (273 A.D., under\r\nAurelian), and the great palace of Diocletian at Spalato, in Dalmatia\r\n(300 A.D.), are still the wonder of the few travellers who reach those\r\ndistant spots.\r\n\r\nWhile during the third and fourth centuries there was a marked decline\r\nin purity and refinement of detail, many of the later works of the\r\nperiod display a remarkable freedom and originality in conception. But\r\nthese works are really not Roman, they are foreign, that is, provincial\r\nproducts; and the transfer of the capital to Byzantium revealed the\r\nincreasing degree in which Rome was coming to look to the East for her\r\nstrength and her art.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 53.--TEMPLE OF VENUS AND ROME. PLAN.]\r\n\r\n+TEMPLES.+ The Romans built both rectangular and circular temples, and\r\nthere was much variety in their treatment. In the rectangular temples a\r\nhigh _podium_, or basement, was substituted for the Greek stepped\r\nstylobate, and the prostyle plan was more common than the peripteral.\r\nThe cella was relatively short and wide, the front porch inordinately\r\ndeep, and frequently divided by longitudinal rows of columns into three\r\naisles. In most cases the exterior of the cella in prostyle temples was\r\ndecorated by engaged columns. A barrel vault gave the interior an aspect\r\nof spaciousness impossible with the Greek system of a wooden ceiling\r\nsupported on double ranges of columns. In the place of these, free or\r\nengaged columns along the side-walls received the ribs of the vaulting.\r\nBetween these ribs the ceiling was richly panelled, or coffered and\r\nsumptuously gilded. The temples of +Fortuna Virilis+ and of +Faustina+\r\nat Rome (the latter built 141 A.D., and its ruins incorporated into the\r\nmodern church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda), and the beautiful and admirably\r\npreserved +Maison Carrée+, at Nîmes (France) (4 A.D.) are examples of\r\nthis type. The temple of +Concord+, of which only the podium remains,\r\nand the small temple of Julius (both of these in the Forum) illustrate\r\nanother form of prostyle temple in which the porch was on a long side of\r\nthe cella. Some of the larger temples were peripteral. The temple of the\r\n+Dioscuri+ (Castor and Pollux) in the Forum, was one of the most\r\nmagnificent of these, certainly the richest in detail (Fig. 44). Very\r\nremarkable was the double temple of +Venus and Rome+, east of the Forum,\r\ndesigned by the Emperor Hadrian about 130 A.D. (Fig. 53). It was a vast\r\npseudodipteral edifice containing two cellas in one structure, their\r\nstatue-niches or apses meeting back to back in the centre. The temple\r\nstood in the midst of an imposing columnar peribolus entered by\r\nmagnificent gateways. Other important temples have already been\r\nmentioned on p. 91.\r\n\r\nBesides the two circular temples already described, the temple of Vesta,\r\nadjoining the House of the Vestals, at the east end of the Forum should\r\nbe mentioned. At Baalbec is a circular temple whose entablature curves\r\ninward between the widely-spaced columns until it touches the cella in\r\nthe middle of each intercolumniation. It illustrates the caprices of\r\ndesign which sometimes resulted from the disregard of tradition and the\r\nstriving after originality (273 A.D.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 54.--PLAN OF THE PANTHEON.]\r\n\r\n+THE PANTHEON.+ The noblest of all circular temples of Rome and of the\r\nworld was the +Pantheon+. It was built by Hadrian, 117-138 A.D., on the\r\nsite of the earlier rectangular temple of the same name erected by\r\nAgrippa. It measures 142 feet in diameter internally; the wall is 20\r\nfeet thick and supports a hemispherical dome rising to a height of 140\r\nfeet (Figs. 54, 55). Light is admitted solely through a round opening 28\r\nfeet in diameter at the top of the dome, the simplest and most\r\nimpressive method of illumination conceivable. The rain and snow that\r\nenter produce no appreciable effect upon the temperature of the vast\r\nhall. There is a single entrance, with noble bronze doors, admitting\r\ndirectly to the interior, around which seven niches, alternately\r\nrectangular and semicircular in plan and fronted by Corinthian columns,\r\nlighten, without weakening, the mass of the encircling wall. This wall\r\nwas originally incrusted with rich marbles, and the great dome, adorned\r\nwith deep coffering in rectangular panels, was decorated with rosettes\r\nand mouldings in gilt stucco. The dome appears to have been composed of\r\nnumerous arches and ribs, filled in and finally coated with concrete.\r\nA recent examination of a denuded portion of its inner surface has\r\nconvinced the writer that the interior panelling was executed after, and\r\nnot during, its construction, by hewing the panels out of the mass of\r\nbrick and concrete, without regard to the form and position of the\r\norigin skeleton of ribs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 55.--INTERIOR OF THE PANTHEON.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 56.--EXTERIOR OF THE PANTHEON.\r\n  (From model in Metropolitan Museum, New York.)]\r\n\r\nThe exterior (Fig. 56) was less successful than the interior. The gabled\r\nporch of twelve superb granite columns 50 feet high, three-aisled in\r\nplan after the Etruscan mode, and covered originally by a ceiling of\r\nbronze, was a rebuilding with the materials and on the plan of the\r\noriginal pronaos of the Pantheon of Agrippa. The circular wall behind it\r\nis faced with fine brickwork, and displays, like the dome, many curious\r\narrangements of discharging arches, reminiscences of traditional\r\nconstructive precautions here wholly useless and fictitious because only\r\nskin-deep. A revetment of marble below and plaster above once concealed\r\nthis brick facing. The portico, in spite of its too steep gable (once\r\nfilled with a “gigantomachia” in gilt bronze) and its somewhat awkward\r\nassociation with a round building, is nevertheless a noble work, its\r\ncapitals in Pentelic marble ranking among the finest known examples of\r\nthe Roman Corinthian. Taken as a whole, the Pantheon is one of the great\r\nmasterpieces of the world’s architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 57.--FORUM AND BASILICA OF TRAJAN.]\r\n\r\n+FORA AND BASILICAS.+ The fora were the places for general public\r\nassemblage. The chief of those in Rome, the +Forum Magnum+, or +Forum\r\nRomanum+, was at first merely an irregular vacant space, about and in\r\nwhich, as the focus of the civic life, temples, halls, colonnades, and\r\nstatues gradually accumulated. These chance aggregations the systematic\r\nRoman mind reduced in time to orderly and monumental form; successive\r\nemperors extended them and added new fora at enormous cost and with\r\ngreat splendor of architecture. Those of Julius, Augustus, Vespasian,\r\nand Nerva (or Domitian), adjoining the Roman Forum, were magnificent\r\nenclosures surrounded by high walls and single or double colonnades.\r\nEach contained a temple or basilica, besides gateways, memorial columns\r\nor arches, and countless statues. The +Forum of Trajan+ surpassed all\r\nthe rest; it covered an area of thirty-five thousand square yards, and\r\nincluded, besides the main area, entered through a triumphal arch, the\r\nBasilica Ulpia, the temple of Trajan, and his colossal Doric column of\r\nVictory. Both in size and beauty it ranked as the chief architectural\r\nglory of the city (Fig. 57). The six fora together contained thirteen\r\ntemples, three basilicas, eight triumphal arches, a mile of porticos,\r\nand a number of other public edifices.[14] Besides these, a net-work of\r\ncolonnades covered large tracts of the city, affording sheltered\r\ncommunication in every direction, and here and there expanding into\r\nsquares or gardens surrounded by peristyles.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: Lanciani: _Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent\r\n    Discoveries_, p. 89.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 58.--BASILICA OF CONSTANTINE. PLAN.]\r\n\r\nThe public business of Rome, both judicial and commercial, was largely\r\ntransacted in the _basilicas_, large buildings consisting usually of a\r\nwide and lofty central nave flanked by lower side-aisles, and\r\nterminating at one or both ends in an apse or semicircular recess called\r\nthe _tribune_, in which were the seats for the magistrates. The\r\nside-aisles were separated from the nave by columns supporting a\r\nclearstory wall, pierced by windows above the roofs of the side-aisles.\r\nIn some cases the latter were two stories high, with galleries; in\r\nothers the central space was open to the sky, as at Pompeii, suggesting\r\nthe derivation of the basilica from the open square surrounded by\r\ncolonnades, or from the forum itself, with which we find it usually\r\nassociated. The most important basilicas in Rome were the +Sempronian+,\r\nthe +Æmilian+ (about 54 B.C.), the +Julian+ in the Forum Magnum (51\r\nB.C.), and the +Ulpian+ in the Forum of Trajan (113 A.D.). The last two\r\nwere probably open basilicas, only the side-aisles being roofed. The\r\nUlpian (Fig. 57) was the most magnificent of all, and in conjunction\r\nwith the Forum of Trajan formed one of the most imposing of those\r\nmonumental aggregations of columnar architecture which contributed so\r\nlargely to the splendor of the Roman capital.\r\n\r\nThese monuments frequently suffered from the burning of their wooden\r\nroofs. It was Constantine who completed the first vaulted and fireproof\r\nbasilica, begun by his predecessor and rival, Maxentius, on the site of\r\nthe former Temple of Peace (Figs. 58, 59). Its design reproduced on a\r\ngrand scale the plan of the tepidarium-halls of the thermæ, the\r\nside-recesses of which were converted into a continuous side-aisle by\r\npiercing arches through the buttress-walls that separated them. Above\r\nthe imposing vaults of these recesses and under the cross-vaults of the\r\nnave were windows admitting abundant light. A _narthex_, or porch,\r\npreceded the hall at one end; there were also a side entrance from the\r\nVia Sacra, and an apse or tribune for the magistrates opposite each of\r\nthese entrances. The dimensions of the main hall (325 × 85 feet), the\r\nheight of its vault (117 feet), and the splendor of its columns and\r\nincrustations excited universal admiration, and exercised a powerful\r\ninfluence on later architecture.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 59.--BASILICA OF CONSTANTINE. RUINS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 60.--THERMÆ OF CARACALLA.\r\n  PLAN OF CENTRAL BLOCK.\r\n  A, _Caldarium, or Hot Bath_; B, _Intermediate Chamber_;\r\n  C, _Tepidarium, or Warm Bath_; D, _Frigidarium, or Cold Bath_;\r\n  E, _Peristyles_; a, _Gymnastic Rooms_; b, _Dressing Rooms_;\r\n  c, _Cooling Rooms_; d, _Small Courts_; e, _Entrances_;\r\n  v, _Vestibules_.]\r\n\r\n+THERMÆ.+ The leisure of the Roman people was largely spent in the great\r\nbaths, or _thermæ_, which took the place substantially of the modern\r\nclub. The establishments erected by the emperors for this purpose were\r\nvast and complex congeries of large and small halls, courts, and\r\nchambers, combined with a masterly comprehension of artistic propriety\r\nand effect in the sequence of oblong, square, oval, and circular\r\napartments, and in the relation of the greater to the lesser masses.\r\nThey were a combination of the Greek _palæstra_ with the Roman _balnea_,\r\nand united in one harmonious design great public swimming-baths, private\r\nbaths for individuals and families, places for gymnastic exercises and\r\ngames, courts, peristyles, gardens, halls for literary entertainments,\r\nlounging-rooms, and all the complex accommodation required for the\r\nservice of the whole establishment. They were built with apparent\r\ndisregard of cost, and adorned with splendid extravagance. The earliest\r\nwere the +Baths of Agrippa+ (27 B.C.) behind the Pantheon; next may be\r\nmentioned those of +Titus+, built on the substructions of Nero’s Golden\r\nHouse. The remains of the +Thermæ of Caracalla+ (211 A.D.) form the most\r\nextensive mass of ruins in Rome, and clearly display the admirable\r\nplanning of this and similar establishments. A gigantic block of\r\nbuildings containing the three great halls for cold, warm, and hot\r\nbaths, stood in the centre of a vast enclosure surrounded by private\r\nbaths, _exedræ_, and halls for lecture-audiences and other gatherings.\r\nThe enclosure was adorned with statues, flower-gardens, and places for\r\nout-door games. The +Baths of Diocletian+ (302 A.D.) embodied this\r\narrangement on a still more extensive scale; they could accommodate\r\n3,500 bathers at once, and their ruins cover a broad territory near the\r\nrailway terminus of the modern city. The church of S. Maria degli Angeli\r\nwas formed by Michael Angelo out of the _tepidarium_ of these\r\nbaths--a colossal hall 340 × 87 feet, and 90 feet high. The original\r\nvaulting and columns are still intact, and the whole interior most\r\nimposing, in spite of later stucco disfigurements. The circular\r\n_laconicum_ (sweat-room) serves as the porch to the present church. It\r\nwas in the building of these great halls that Roman architecture reached\r\nits most original and characteristic expression. Wholly unrelated to any\r\nforeign model, they represent distinctively Roman ideals, both as to\r\nplan and construction.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 61.--ROMAN THEATRE. (HERCULANUM.)\r\n  (From model.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 62.--COLOSSEUM. HALF PLAN.]\r\n\r\n+PLACES OF AMUSEMENT.+ The earliest Roman theatres differed from the\r\nGreek in having a nearly semicircular plan, and in being built up from\r\nthe level ground, not excavated in a hillside (Fig. 61). The first\r\ntheatre was of wood, built by Mummius 145 B.C., and it was not until\r\nninety years later that stone was first substituted for the more\r\nperishable material, in the theatre of Pompey. The +Theatre of\r\nMarcellus+ (23-13 B.C.) is in part still extant, and later theatres in\r\nPompeii, Orange (France), and in the Asiatic provinces are in excellent\r\npreservation. The orchestra was not, as in the Greek theatre, reserved\r\nfor the choral dance, but was given up to spectators of rank; the stage\r\nwas adorned with a permanent architectural background of columns and\r\narches, and sometimes roofed with wood, and an arcade or colonnade\r\nsurrounded the upper tier of seats. The amphitheatre was a still more\r\ndistinctively Roman edifice. It was elliptical in plan, surrounding an\r\nelliptical arena, and built up with continuous encircling tiers of\r\nseats. The earliest stone amphitheatre was erected by Statilius Taurus\r\nin the time of Augustus. It was practically identical in design with the\r\nlater and much larger Flavian amphitheatre, commonly known as the\r\n+Colosseum+, begun by Vespasian and completed 82 A.D. (Fig. 62). This\r\nimmense structure measured 607 × 506 feet in plan and was 180 feet high;\r\nit could accommodate eighty-seven thousand spectators. Engaged columns\r\nof the Tuscan, Ionic, and Corinthian orders decorated three stories of\r\nthe exterior; the fourth was a nearly unbroken wall with slender\r\nCorinthian pilasters. Solidly constructed of travertine, concrete, and\r\ntufa, the Colosseum, with its imposing but monotonous exterior, almost\r\nsublime by its scale and seemingly endless repetition, but lacking in\r\nrefinement or originality of detail and dedicated to bloody and cruel\r\nsports, was a characteristic product of the Roman character and\r\ncivilization. At Verona, Pola, Capua, and many cities in the foreign\r\nprovinces there are well-preserved remains of similar structures.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the amphitheatre were the circus and the stadium. The\r\n+Circus Maximus+ between the Palatine and Aventine hills was the oldest\r\nof those in Rome. That erected by Caligula and Nero on the site\r\nafterward partly occupied by St. Peter’s, was more splendid, and is said\r\nto have been capable of accommodating over three hundred thousand\r\nspectators after its enlargement in the fourth century. The long, narrow\r\nrace-course was divided into two nearly equal parts by a low parapet,\r\nthe _spina_, on which were the goals (_metæ_) and many small decorative\r\nstructures and columns. One end of the circus, as of the stadium also,\r\nwas semicircular; the other was segmental in the circus, square in the\r\nstadium; a colonnade or arcade ran along the top of the building, and\r\nthe entrances and exits were adorned with monumental arches.\r\n\r\n\r\n+TRIUMPHAL ARCHES AND COLUMNS.+ Rome and the provincial cities abounded\r\nin monuments commemorative of victory, usually single or triple arches\r\nwith engaged columns and rich sculptural adornments, or single colossal\r\ncolumns supporting statues. The arches were characteristic products of\r\nRoman design, and some of them deserve high praise for the excellence of\r\ntheir proportions and the elegance of their details. There were in Rome\r\nin the second century A.D., thirty-eight of these monuments. The +Arch\r\nof Titus+ (71-82 A.D.) is the simplest and most perfect of those still\r\nextant in Rome; the arch of +Septimius Severus+ in the Forum (203 A.D.)\r\nand that of +Constantine+ (330 A.D.) near the Colosseum, are more\r\nsumptuous but less pure in detail. The last-named was in part enriched\r\nwith sculptures taken from the earlier arch of Trajan. The statues of\r\nDacian captives on the attic (_attic_ = a species of subordinate story\r\nadded above the main cornice) of this arch were a fortunate addition,\r\nfurnishing a _raison-d’être_ for the columns and broken entablatures on\r\nwhich they rest. Memorial columns of colossal size were erected by\r\nseveral emperors, both in Rome and abroad. Those of +Trajan+ and of\r\n+Marcus Aurelius+ are still standing in Rome in perfect preservation.\r\nThe first was 140 feet high including the pedestal and the statue which\r\nsurmounted it; its capital marked the height of the ridge levelled by\r\nthe emperor for the forum on which the column stands. Its most striking\r\npeculiarity is the spiral band of reliefs winding around the shaft from\r\nbottom to top and representing the Dacian campaigns of Trajan. The other\r\ncolumn is of similar design and dimensions, but greatly inferior to the\r\nfirst in execution. Both are really towers, with interior stair-cases\r\nleading to the top.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 63.--ARCH OF CONSTANTINE.\r\n  (From model in Metropolitan Museum, New York.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n+TOMBS.+ The Romans developed no special and national type of tomb, and\r\nfew of their sepulchral monuments were of large dimensions. The most\r\nimportant in Rome were the pyramid of +Caius Cestius+ (late first\r\ncentury B.C.), and the circular tombs of +Cecilia Metella+ (60 B.C.),\r\n+Augustus+ (14 A.D.) and +Hadrian+, now the Castle of S. Angelo (138\r\nA.D.). The latter was composed of a huge cone of marble supported on a\r\ncylindrical structure 230 feet in diameter standing on a square podium\r\n300 feet long and wide. The cone probably once terminated in the gilt\r\nbronze pine-cone now in the Giardino della Pigna of the Vatican. In the\r\nMausoleum of Augustus a mound of earth planted with trees crowned a\r\nsimilar circular base of marble on a podium 220 feet square, now buried.\r\n\r\nThe smaller tombs varied greatly in size and form. Some were vaulted\r\nchambers, with graceful internal painted decorations of figures and vine\r\npatterns combined with low-relief enrichments in stucco. Others were\r\ndesigned in the form of altars or sarcophagi, as at Pompeii; while\r\nothers again resembled ædiculæ, little temples, shrines, or small towers\r\nin several stories of arches and columns, as at St. Rémy (France).\r\n\r\n\r\n+PALACES AND DWELLINGS.+ Into their dwellings the Romans carried all\r\ntheir love of ostentation and personal luxury. They anticipated in many\r\ndetails the comforts of modern civilization in their furniture, their\r\nplumbing and heating, and their utensils. Their houses may be divided\r\ninto four classes: the palace, the villa, the _domus_ or ordinary house,\r\nand the _insula_ or many-storied tenement built in compact blocks. The\r\nfirst three alone concern us, and will be taken up in the above order.\r\n\r\nThe imperial +palaces+ on the Palatine Hill comprised a wide range in\r\nstyle and variety of buildings, beginning with the first simple house of\r\nAugustus (26 B.C.), burnt and rebuilt 3 A.D. Tiberius, Caligula, and\r\nNero added to the Augustan group; Domitian rebuilt a second time and\r\nenlarged the palace of Augustus, and Septimius Severus remodelled the\r\nwhole group, adding to it his own extraordinary seven-storied palace,\r\nthe Septizonium. The ruins of these successive buildings have been\r\ncarefully excavated, and reveal a remarkable combination of\r\ndwelling-rooms, courts, temples, libraries, basilicas, baths, gardens,\r\nperistyles, fountains, terraces, and covered passages. These were\r\nadorned with a profusion of precious marbles, mosaics, columns, and\r\nstatues. Parts of the demolished palace of Nero were incorporated in the\r\nsubstructions of the Baths of Titus. The beautiful arabesques and\r\nplaster reliefs which adorned them were the inspiration of much of the\r\nfresco and stucco decoration of the Italian Renaissance. At Spalato, in\r\nDalmatia, are the extensive ruins of the great +Palace of Diocletian+,\r\nwhich was laid out on the plan of a Roman camp, with two intersecting\r\navenues (Fig. 64). It comprised a temple, mausoleum, basilica, and other\r\nstructures besides those portions devoted to the purposes of a royal\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 64.--PALACE OF DIOCLETIAN. SPALATO.]\r\n\r\nThe +villa+ was in reality a country palace, arranged with special\r\nreference to the prevailing winds, exposure to the sun and shade, and\r\nthe enjoyment of a wide prospect. Baths, temples, _exedræ_, theatres,\r\ntennis-courts, sun-rooms, and shaded porticoes were connected with the\r\nhouse proper, which was built around two or three interior courts or\r\nperistyles. Statues, fountains, and colossal vases of marble adorned the\r\ngrounds, which were laid out in terraces and treated with all the\r\nfantastic arts of the Roman landscape-gardener. The most elaborate and\r\nextensive villa was that of +Hadrian+, at Tibur (Tivoli); its ruins,\r\ncovering hundreds of acres, form one of the most interesting spots to\r\nvisit in the neighborhood of Rome.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 65.--HOUSE OF PANSA, POMPEII.\r\n  s, _Shops_; v, _Vestibule_; f, _Family Rooms_; k, _Kitchen_;\r\n  l, _Lavarium_; _P, P, P_, _Peristyles_.]\r\n\r\nThere are few remains in Rome of the +domus+ or private house. Two,\r\nhowever, have left remarkably interesting ruins--the +Atrium Vestæ+, or\r\nHouse of the Vestal Virgins, east of the Forum, a well-planned and\r\nextensive house surrounding a cloister or court; and the +House of\r\nLivia+, so-called, on the Palatine Hill, the walls and decorations of\r\nwhich are excellently preserved. The typical Roman house in a provincial\r\ntown is best illustrated by the ruins of Pompeii and Herculanum, which,\r\nburied by an eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D., have been partially\r\nexcavated since 1721. The Pompeiian house (Fig. 65) consisted of several\r\ncourts or _atria_, some of which were surrounded by colonnades and\r\ncalled _peristyles_. The front portion was reserved for shops, or\r\npresented to the street a wall unbroken save by the entrance; all the\r\nrooms and chambers opened upon the interior courts, from which alone\r\nthey borrowed their light. In the brilliant climate of southern Italy\r\nwindows were little needed, as sufficient light was admitted by the\r\ndoor, closed only by portières for the most part; especially as the\r\nfamily life was passed mainly in the shaded courts, to which fountains,\r\nparterres of shrubbery, statues, and other adornments lent their\r\ninviting charm. The general plan of these houses seems to have been of\r\nGreek origin, as well as the system of decoration used on the walls.\r\nThese, when not wainscoted with marble, were covered with fantastic, but\r\noften artistic, painted decorations, in which an imaginary architecture\r\nas of metal, a fantastic and arbitrary perspective, illusory pictures,\r\nand highly finished figures were the chief elements. These were executed\r\nin brilliant colors with excellent effect. The houses were lightly\r\nbuilt, with wooden ceilings and roofs instead of vaulting, and usually\r\nwith but one story on account of the danger from earthquakes. That the\r\nworkmanship and decoration were in the capital often superior to what\r\nwas to be found in a provincial town like Pompeii, is evidenced by\r\nbeautiful wall-paintings and reliefs discovered in Rome in 1879 and now\r\npreserved in the Museo delle Terme. More or less fragmentary remains of\r\nRoman houses have been found in almost every corner of the Roman empire,\r\nbut nowhere exhibiting as completely as in Pompeii the typical Roman\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n+WORKS OF UTILITY.+ A word should be said about Roman engineering works,\r\nwhich in many cases were designed with an artistic sense of proportion\r\nand form which raises them into the domain of genuine art. Such were\r\nespecially the bridges, in which a remarkable effect of monumental\r\ngrandeur was often produced by the form and proportions of the arches\r\nand piers, and an appropriate use of rough and dressed masonry, as in\r\nthe Pons Ælius (Ponte S. Angelo), the great bridge at Alcantara (Spain),\r\nand the Pont du Gard, in southern France. The aqueducts are impressive\r\nrather by their length, scale, and simplicity, than by any special\r\nrefinements of design, except where their arches are treated with some\r\narchitectural decoration to form gates, as in the Porta Maggiore, at\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS:+ (Those which have no important extant remains are\r\n  given in italics.)

The new religion rapidly enlisted in its service for a common\r\npurpose and under a common impulse races as wide apart in blood and\r\nculture as those which had built up the art of imperial Rome. It was\r\nChristianity which reduced to civilization in the West the Germanic\r\nhordes that had overthrown Rome, bringing their fresh and hitherto\r\nuntamed vigor to the task of recreating architecture out of the decaying\r\nfragments of classic art. So in the East its life-giving influence awoke\r\nthe slumbering Greek art-instinct to new triumphs in the arts of\r\nbuilding, less refined and perfect indeed, but not less sublime than\r\nthose of the Periclean age. Long before the Constantinian edict, the\r\nChristians in the Eastern provinces had enjoyed substantial freedom of\r\nworship. Meeting often in the private basilicas of wealthy converts, and\r\nfinding these, and still more the great public basilicas, suited to the\r\nrequirements of their worship, they early began to build in imitation of\r\nthese edifices. There are many remains of these early churches in\r\nnorthern Africa and central Syria.\r\n\r\n\r\n+EARLY CHRISTIAN ART IN ROME.+ This was at first wholly sepulchral,\r\ndeveloping in the catacombs the symbols of the new faith. Once\r\nliberated, however, Christianity appropriated bodily for its public\r\nrites the basilica-type and the general substance of Roman architecture.\r\nShafts and capitals, architraves and rich linings of veined marble, even\r\nthe pagan Bacchic symbolism of the vine, it adapted to new uses in its\r\nown service. Constantine led the way in architecture, endowing Bethlehem\r\nand Jerusalem with splendid churches, and his new capital on the\r\nBosphorus with the first of the three historic basilicas dedicated to\r\nthe Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia). One of the greatest of innovators, he\r\nseems to have had a special predilection for circular buildings, and the\r\ntombs and baptisteries which he erected in this form, especially that\r\nfor his sister Constantia in Rome (known as Santa Costanza, Fig. 66),\r\nfurnished the prototype for numberless Italian baptisteries in later\r\nages.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 66.--STA. COSTANZA, ROME.]\r\n\r\nThe Christian basilica (see Figs. 67, 68) generally comprised a broad\r\nand lofty nave, separated by rows of columns from the single or double\r\nside-aisles. The aisles had usually about half the width and height of\r\nthe nave, and like it were covered with wooden roofs and ceilings. Above\r\nthe columns which flanked the nave rose the lofty clearstory wall,\r\npierced with windows above the side-aisle roofs and supporting the\r\nimmense trusses of the roof of the nave. The timbering of the latter was\r\nsometimes bare, sometimes concealed by a richly panelled ceiling,\r\ncarved, gilded, and painted. At the further end of the nave was the\r\nsanctuary or apse, with the seats for the clergy on a raised platform,\r\nthe _bema_, in front of which was the altar. Transepts sometimes\r\nexpanded to right and left before the altar, under which was the\r\n_confessio_ or shrine of the titular saint or martyr.\r\n\r\nAn _atrium_ or forecourt surrounded by a covered arcade preceded the\r\nbasilica proper, the arcade at the front of the church forming a porch\r\nor _narthex_, which, however, in some cases existed without the atrium.\r\nThe exterior was extremely plain; the interior, on the contrary, was\r\nresplendent with incrustations of veined marble and with sumptuous\r\ndecorations in glass mosaic (called _opus Grecanicum_) on a blue or\r\ngolden ground. Especially rich were the half-dome of the apse and the\r\nwall-space surrounding its arch and called the _triumphal arch_; next in\r\ndecorative importance came the broad band of wall beneath the clearstory\r\nwindows. Upon these surfaces the mosaic-workers wrought with minute\r\ncubes of colored glass pictures and symbols almost imperishable, in\r\nwhich the glow of color and a certain decorative grandeur of effect in\r\nthe composition went far to atone for the uncouth drawing. With growing\r\nwealth and an increasingly elaborate ritual, the furniture and\r\nequipments of the church assumed greater architectural importance.\r\nA large rectangular space was retained for the choir in front of the\r\nbema, and enclosed by a breast-high parapet of marble, richly inlaid. On\r\neither side were the pulpits or _ambones_ for the Gospel and Epistle.\r\nA lofty canopy was built over the altar, the _baldaquin_, supported on\r\nfour marble columns. A few basilicas were built with side-aisles, in two\r\nstories, as in S. Lorenzo and Sta. Agnese. Adjoining the basilica in the\r\nearlier examples were the baptistery and the tomb of the saint, circular\r\nor polygonal buildings usually; but in later times these were replaced\r\nby the font or baptismal chapel in the church and the _confessio_ under\r\nthe altar.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 67.--PLAN OF THE BASILICA OF ST. PAUL.]\r\n\r\nOf the two Constantinian basilicas in Rome, the one dedicated to +St.\r\nPeter+ was demolished in the fifteenth century; that of +St. John\r\nLateran+ has been so disfigured by modern alterations as to be\r\nunrecognizable. The former of the two adjoined the site of the martyrdom\r\nof St. Peter in the circus of Caligula and Nero; it was five-aisled, 380\r\nfeet in length by 212 feet in width. The nave was 80 feet wide and 100\r\nfeet high, and the disproportionately high clearstory wall rested on\r\nhorizontal architraves carried by columns. The impressive dimensions and\r\nsimple plan of this structure gave it a majesty worthy of its rank as\r\nthe first church of Christendom. +St. Paul beyond the Walls+ (S. Paolo\r\nfuori le mura), built in 386 by Theodosius, resembled St. Peter’s\r\nclosely in plan (Figs. 67, 68). Destroyed by fire in 1821, it has been\r\nrebuilt with almost its pristine splendor, and is, next to the modern\r\nSt. Peter’s and the Pantheon, the most impressive place of worship in\r\nRome. +Santa Maria Maggiore+,[15] though smaller in size, is more\r\ninteresting because it so largely retains its original aspect, its\r\nRenaissance ceiling happily harmonizing with its simple antique lines.\r\nIonic columns support architraves to carry the clearstory, as in St.\r\nPeter’s. In most other examples, St. Paul’s included, arches turned from\r\ncolumn to column perform this function. The first known case of such use\r\nof classic columns as arch-bearers was in the palace of Diocletian at\r\nSpalato; it also appears in Syrian buildings of the third and fourth\r\ncenturies A.D.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: Hereafter the abbreviation S. M. will be generally\r\n    used instead of the name Santa Maria.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 68.--ST. PAUL BEYOND THE WALLS. INTERIOR.]\r\n\r\nThe basilica remained the model for ecclesiastical architecture in Rome,\r\nwithout noticeable change either of plan or detail, until the time of\r\nthe Renaissance. All the earlier examples employed columns and capitals\r\ntaken from ancient ruins, often incongruous and ill-matched in size and\r\norder. +San Clemente+ (1084) has retained almost intact its early\r\naspect, its choir-enclosure, baldaquin, and ambones having been well\r\npreserved or carefully restored. Other important basilicas are mentioned\r\nin the list of monuments on pages 118, 119.\r\n\r\n\r\n+RAVENNA.+ The fifth and sixth centuries endowed Ravenna with a number\r\nof notable buildings which, with the exception of the cathedral,\r\ndemolished in the last century, have been preserved to our day. Subdued\r\nby the Byzantine emperor Justinian in 537, Ravenna became the\r\nmeeting-ground for Early Christian and Byzantine traditions and the\r\nbasilican and circular plans are both represented. The two churches\r\ndedicated to St. Apollinaris, +S. Apollinare Nuovo+ (520) in the city,\r\nand +S. Apollinare in Classe+ (538) three miles distant from the city,\r\nin what was formerly the port, are especially interesting for their fine\r\nmosaics, and for the impost-blocks interposed above the capitals of\r\ntheir columns to receive the springing of the pier-arches. These blocks\r\nappear to be somewhat crude modifications of the fragmentary architraves\r\nor entablatures employed in classic Roman architecture to receive the\r\nspringing of vaults sustained by columns, and became common in Byzantine\r\nstructures (Fig. 73). The use of external arcading to give some slight\r\nadornment to the walls of the second of the above-named churches, and\r\nthe round bell-towers of brick which adjoined both of them, were first\r\nsteps toward the development of the “wall-veil” or arcaded decoration,\r\nand of the campaniles, which in later centuries became so characteristic\r\nof north Italian churches (see Chapter XIII.). In Rome the campaniles\r\nwhich accompany many of the mediæval basilicas are square and pierced\r\nwith many windows.\r\n\r\nThe basilican form of church became general in Italy, a large proportion\r\nof whose churches continued to be built with wooden roofs and with but\r\nslight deviations from the original type, long after the appearance of\r\nthe Gothic style. The chief departures from early precedent were in the\r\nexterior, which was embellished with marble incrustations as in\r\nS. Miniato (Florence); or with successive stories of wall-arcades, as in\r\nmany churches in Pisa and Lucca (see Fig. 90); until finally the\r\nintroduction of clustered piers, pointed arches, and vaulting, gradually\r\ntransformed the basilican into the Italian Romanesque and Gothic styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n+SYRIA AND THE EAST.+ In Syria, particularly the central portion, the\r\nChristian architecture of the 3d to 8th centuries produced a number of\r\nvery interesting monuments. The churches built by Constantine in\r\nSyria--the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (nominally built by his\r\nmother), of the Ascension at Jerusalem, the magnificent octagonal church\r\non the site of the Temple, and finally the somewhat similar church at\r\nAntioch--were the most notable Christian monuments in Syria. The first\r\nthree on the list, still extant in part at least, have been so altered\r\nby later additions and restorations that their original forms are only\r\napproximately known from early descriptions. They were all of large\r\nsize, and the octagonal church on the Temple platform was of exceptional\r\nmagnificence.[16] The columns and a part of the marble incrustations of\r\nthe early design are still visible in the “Mosque of Omar,” but most of\r\nthe old work is concealed by the decoration of tiles applied by the\r\nMoslems, and the whole interior aspect altered by the wood-and-plaster\r\ndome with which they replaced the simpler roof of the original.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Fergusson (_History of Architecture_, vol. ii., pp.\r\n    408, 432) contends that this was the real Constantinian church of\r\n    the Holy Sepulchre, and that the one called to-day by that name\r\n    was erected by the Crusaders in the twelfth century. The more\r\n    general view is that the latter was originally built by\r\n    Constantine as the Church of the Sepulchre, though subsequently\r\n    much altered, and that the octagonal edifice was also his work,\r\n    but erected under some other name. Whether this church was later\r\n    incorporated in the “Mosque of Omar,” or merely furnished some of\r\n    the materials for its construction, is not quite clear.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 69.--CHURCH AT KALB LOUZEH.]\r\n\r\nChristian architecture in Syria soon, however, diverged from Roman\r\ntraditions. The abundance of hard stone, the total lack of clay or\r\nbrick, the remoteness from Rome, led to a peculiar independence and\r\noriginality in the forms and details of the ecclesiastical as well as of\r\nthe domestic architecture of central Syria. These innovations upon Roman\r\nmodels resulted in the development of distinct types which, but for the\r\narrest of progress by the Mohammedan conquest in the seventh century,\r\nwould doubtless have inaugurated a new and independent style of\r\narchitecture. Piers of masonry came to replace the classic column, as at\r\nTafkha (third or fourth century), Rouheiha and Kalb Louzeh (fifth\r\ncentury? Fig. 69); the ceilings in the smaller churches were often\r\nformed with stone slabs; the apse was at first confined within the main\r\nrectangle of the plan, and was sometimes square. The exterior assumed a\r\nstriking and picturesque variety of forms by means of turrets, porches,\r\nand gables. Singularly enough, vaulting hardly appears at all, though\r\nthe arch is used with fine effect. Conventional and monastic groups of\r\nbuildings appear early in Syria, and that of +St. Simeon Stylites+ at\r\nKelat Seman is an impressive and interesting monument. Four three-aisled\r\nwings form the arms of a cross, meeting in a central octagonal open\r\ncourt, in the midst of which stood the column of the saint. The eastern\r\narm of the cross forms a complete basilica of itself, and the whole\r\ncross measures 330 × 300 feet. Chapels, cloisters, and cells adjoin the\r\nmain edifice.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 70.--CATHEDRAL AT BOZRAH.]\r\n\r\nCircular and polygonal plans appear in a number of Syrian examples of\r\nthe early sixth century. Their most striking feature is the inscribing\r\nof the circle or polygon in a square which forms the exterior outline,\r\nand the use of four niches to fill out the corners. This occurs at Kelat\r\nSeman in a small double church, perhaps the tomb and chapel of a martyr;\r\nin the cathedral at +Bozrah+ (Fig. 70), and in the small domical church\r\nof +St. George+ at +Ezra+. These were probably the prototypes of many\r\nByzantine churches like St. Sergius at Constantinople, and San Vitale at\r\nRavenna (Fig. 74), though the exact dates of the Syrian churches are not\r\nknown. The one at Ezra is the only one of the three which has a dome,\r\nthe others having been roofed with wood.\r\n\r\nThe interesting domestic architecture of this period is preserved in\r\nwhole towns and villages in the Hauran, which, deserted at the Arab\r\nconquest, have never been reoccupied and remain almost intact but for\r\nthe decay of their wooden roofs. They are marked by dignity and\r\nsimplicity of design, and by the same picturesque massing of gables and\r\nroofs and porches which has already been remarked of the churches. The\r\narches are broad, the columns rather heavy, the mouldings few and\r\nsimple, and the scanty carving vigorous and effective, often strongly\r\nByzantine in type.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in the Eastern world are many early churches of which even the\r\nenumeration would exceed the limits of this work. Salonica counts a\r\nnumber of basilicas and several domical churches. The church of +St.\r\nGeorge+, now a mosque, is of early date and thoroughly Roman in plan and\r\nsection, of the same class with the Pantheon and the tomb of Helena, in\r\nboth of which a massive circular wall is lightened by eight niches. At\r\nAngora (Ancyra), Hierapolis, Pergamus, and other points in Asia Minor;\r\nin Egypt, Nubia, and Algiers, are many examples of both circular and\r\nbasilican edifices of the early centuries of Christianity. In\r\nConstantinople there remains but a single representative of the\r\nbasilican type, the church of +St. John Studius+, now the Emir Akhor\r\nmosque.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS+: ROME: 4th century: St. Peter’s, Sta.

Texier and Pullan, _Byzantine Architecture_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ORIGIN AND CHARACTER.+ The decline and fall of Rome arrested the\r\ndevelopment of the basilican style in the West, as did the Arab conquest\r\nlater in Syria. It was otherwise in the new Eastern capital founded by\r\nConstantine in the ancient Byzantium, which was rising in power and\r\nwealth while Rome lay in ruins. Situated at the strategic point of the\r\nnatural highway of commerce between East and West, salubrious and\r\nenchantingly beautiful in its surroundings, the new capital grew rapidly\r\nfrom provincial insignificance to metropolitan importance. Its founder\r\nhad embellished it with an extraordinary wealth of buildings, in which,\r\nowing to the scarcity of trained architects, quantity and cost doubtless\r\noutran quality. But at least the tameness of blindly followed precedent\r\nwas avoided, and this departure from traditional tenets contributed\r\nundoubtedly to the originality of Byzantine architecture. A large part\r\nof the artisans employed in building were then, as now, from Asia Minor\r\nand the Ægean Islands, Greek in race if not in name. An Oriental taste\r\nfor brilliant and harmonious color and for minute decoration spread over\r\nbroad surfaces must have been stimulated by trade with the Far East and\r\nby constant contact with Oriental peoples, costumes, and arts. An\r\nAsiatic origin may also be assigned to the methods of vaulting employed,\r\nfar more varied than the Roman, not only in form but also in materials\r\nand processes. From Roman architecture, however, the Byzantines borrowed\r\nthe fundamental notion of their structural art; that, namely, of\r\ndistributing the weights and strains of their vaulted structures upon\r\nisolated and massive points of support, strengthened by deep buttresses,\r\ninternal or external, as the case might be. Roman, likewise, was the use\r\nof polished monolithic columns, and the incrustation of the piers and\r\nwalls with panels of variegated marble, as well as the decoration of\r\nplastered surfaces by fresco and mosaic, and the use of _opus sectile_\r\nand _opus Alexandrinum_ for the production of sumptuous marble\r\npavements. In the first of these processes the color-figures of the\r\npattern are formed each of a single piece of marble cut to the shape\r\nrequired; in the second the pattern is compounded of minute squares,\r\ntriangles, and curved pieces of uniform size. Under these combined\r\ninfluences the artists of Constantinople wrought out new problems in\r\nconstruction and decoration, giving to all that they touched a new and\r\nstriking character.\r\n\r\nThere is no absolute line of demarcation, chronological, geographical,\r\nor structural, between Early Christian and Byzantine architecture. But\r\nthe former was especially characterized by the basilica with three or\r\nfive aisles, and the use of wooden roofs even in its circular edifices;\r\nthe vault and dome, though not unknown, being exceedingly rare.\r\nByzantine architecture, on the other hand, rarely produced the simple\r\nthree-aisled or five-aisled basilica, and nearly all its monuments were\r\nvaulted. The dome was especially frequent, and Byzantine architecture\r\nachieved its highest triumphs in the use of the _pendentive_, as the\r\ntriangular spherical surfaces are called, by the aid of which a dome can\r\nbe supported on the summits of four arches spanning the four sides of a\r\nsquare, as explained later. There is as little uniformity in the plans\r\nof Byzantine buildings as in the forms of the vaulting. A few types of\r\nchurch-plan, however, predominated locally in one or another centre; but\r\nthe controlling feature of the style was the dome and the constructive\r\nsystem with which it was associated. The dome, it is true, had long been\r\nused by the Romans, but always on a circular plan, as in the Pantheon.\r\nIt is also a fact that pendentives have been found in Syria and Asia\r\nMinor older than the oldest Byzantine examples. But the special feature\r\ncharacterizing the Byzantine dome on pendentives was its almost\r\nexclusive association with plans having piers and columns or aisles,\r\nwith the dome as the central and dominant feature of the complex design\r\n(see plans, Figs. 74, 75, 78). Another strictly Byzantine practice was\r\nthe piercing of the lower portion of the dome with windows forming a\r\ncircle or crown, and the final development of this feature into a high\r\ndrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CONSTRUCTION.+ Still another divergence from Roman methods was in the\r\nsubstitution of brick and stone masonry for concrete. Brick was used for\r\nthe mass as well as the facing of walls and piers, and for the vaulting\r\nin many buildings mainly built of stone. Stone was used either alone or\r\nin combination with brick, the latter appearing in bands of four or five\r\ncourses at intervals of three or four feet. In later work a regular\r\nalternation of the two materials, course for course, was not uncommon.\r\nIn piers intended to support unusually heavy loads the stone was very\r\ncarefully cut and fitted, and sometimes tied and clamped with iron.\r\n\r\nVaults were built sometimes of brick, sometimes of cut stone; in a few\r\ncases even of earthenware jars fitting into each other, and laid up in a\r\ncontinuous contracting spiral from the base to the crown of a dome, as\r\nin San Vitale at Ravenna. Ingenious processes for building vaults\r\nwithout centrings were made use of--processes inherited from the\r\ndrain-builders of ancient Assyria, and still in vogue in Armenia,\r\nPersia, and Asia Minor. The groined vault was common, but always\r\napproximated the form of a dome, by a longitudinal convexity upward in\r\nthe intersecting vaults. The aisles of Hagia Sophia[17] display a\r\nremarkable variety of forms in the vaulting.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: “St. Sophia,” the common name of this church, is a\r\n    misnomer. It was not dedicated to a saint at all, but to the\r\n    Divine Wisdom (Hagia Sophia), which name the Turks have retained\r\n    in the softened form “Aya Sofia.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 71.--DIAGRAM OF PENDENTIVES.]\r\n\r\n+DOMES.+ The dome, as we have seen, early became the most characteristic\r\nfeature of Byzantine architecture; and especially the dome on\r\npendentives. If a hemisphere be cut by five planes, four perpendicular\r\nto its base and bounding a square inscribed therein, and the fifth plane\r\nparallel to the base and tangent to the semicircular intersections made\r\nby the first four, there will remain of the original surface only four\r\ntriangular spaces bounded by arcs of circles. These are called\r\n_pendentives_ (Fig. 71 a). When these are built up of masonry, each\r\ncourse forms a species of arch, by virtue of its convexity. At the crown\r\nof the four arches on which they rest, these courses meet and form a\r\ncomplete circle, perfectly stable and capable of sustaining any\r\nsuperstructure that does not by excessive weight disrupt the whole\r\nfabric by overthrowing the four arches which support it. Upon these\r\npendentives, then, a new dome may be started of any desired curvature,\r\nor even a cylindrical drum to support a still loftier dome, as in the\r\nlater churches (Fig. 71 b). This method of covering a square is simpler\r\nthan the groined vault, having no sharp edges or intersections; it is at\r\nleast as effective architecturally, by reason of its greater height in\r\nthe centre; and is equally applicable to successive bays of an oblong,\r\ncruciform, and even columnar building. In the great cisterns at\r\nConstantinople vast areas are covered by rows of small domes supported\r\non ranges of columns.\r\n\r\nThe earlier domes were commonly pierced with windows at the base, this\r\napparent weakening of the vault being compensated for by strongly\r\nbuttressing the piers between the windows, as in Hagia Sophia. Here\r\nforty windows form a crown of light at the spring of the dome, producing\r\nan effect almost as striking as that of the simple _oculus_ of the\r\nPantheon, and celebrated by ancient writers in the most extravagant\r\nterms. In later and smaller churches a high drum was introduced beneath\r\nthe dome, in order to secure, by means of longer windows, more light\r\nthan could be obtained by merely piercing the diminutive domes.\r\n\r\nButtressing was well understood by the Byzantines, whose plans were\r\nskilfully devised to provide internal abutments, which were often\r\ncontinued above the roofs of the side-aisles to prop the main vaults,\r\nprecisely as was done by the Romans in their thermæ and similar halls.\r\nBut the Byzantines, while adhering less strictly than the Romans to\r\ntraditional forms and processes, and displaying much more ready\r\ncontrivance and special adaptation of means to ends, never worked out\r\nthis pregnant structural principle to its logical conclusion as did the\r\nGothic architects of Western Europe a few centuries later.\r\n\r\n\r\n+DECORATION+. The exteriors of Byzantine buildings (except in some of\r\nthe small churches of late date) were generally bare and lacking in\r\nbeauty. The interiors, on the contrary, were richly decorated, color\r\nplaying a much larger part than carving in the designs. Painting was\r\nresorted to only in the smaller buildings, the more durable and splendid\r\nmedium of mosaic being usually preferred. This was, as a rule, confined\r\nto the vaults and to those portions of the wall-surfaces embraced by the\r\nvaults above their springing. The colors were brilliant, the background\r\nbeing usually of gold, though sometimes of blue or a delicate green.\r\nBiblical scenes, symbolic and allegorical figures and groups of saints\r\nadorned the larger areas, particularly the half-dome of the apse, as in\r\nthe basilicas. The smaller vaults, the soffits of arches, borders of\r\npictures, and other minor surfaces, received a more conventional\r\ndecoration of crosses, monograms, and set patterns.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 72.--SPANDRIL. HAGIA SOPHIA.]\r\n\r\nThe walls throughout were sheathed with slabs of rare marble in panels\r\nso disposed that the veining should produce symmetrical figures. The\r\npanels were framed in billet-mouldings, derived perhaps from classic\r\ndentils; the billets or projections on one side the moulding coming\r\nopposite the spaces on the other. This seems to have been a purely\r\nByzantine feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CARVED DETAILS.+ Internally the different stories were marked by\r\nhorizontal bands and cornices of white or inlaid marble richly carved.\r\nThe arch-soffits, the archivolts or bands around the arches, and the\r\nspandrils between them were covered with minute and intricate incised\r\ncarving. The motives used, though based on the acanthus and anthemion,\r\nwere given a wholly new aspect. The relief was low and flat, the leaves\r\nsharp and crowded, and the effect rich and lacelike, rather than\r\nvigorous. It was, however, well adapted to the covering of large areas\r\nwhere general effect was more important than detail. Even the capitals\r\nwere treated in the same spirit. The impost-block was almost universal,\r\nexcept where its use was rendered unnecessary by giving to the capital\r\nitself the massive pyramidal form required to receive properly the\r\nspring of the arch or vault. In such cases (more frequent in\r\nConstantinople than elsewhere) the surface of the capital was simply\r\ncovered with incised carving of foliage, basketwork, monograms, etc.;\r\nrudimentary volutes in a few cases recalling classic traditions (Figs.\r\n72, 73). The mouldings were weak and poorly executed, and the vigorous\r\nprofiles of classic cornices were only remotely suggested by the\r\ncharacterless aggregations of mouldings which took their place.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 73.--CAPITAL WITH IMPOST BLOCK, S. VITALE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 74.--ST. SERGIUS, CONSTANTINOPLE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 75.--PLAN OF HAGIA SOPHIA.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 76.--SECTION OF HAGIA SOPHIA.]\r\n\r\n+PLANS.+ The remains of Byzantine architecture are almost exclusively of\r\nchurches and baptisteries, but the plans of these are exceedingly\r\nvaried. The first radical departure from the basilica-type seems to have\r\nbeen the adoption of circular or polygonal plans, such as had usually\r\nserved only for tombs and baptisteries. The Baptistery of St. John at\r\nRavenna (early fifth century) is classed by many authorities as a\r\nByzantine monument. In the early years of the sixth century the adoption\r\nof this model had become quite general, and with it the development of\r\ndomical design began to advance. The church of +St. Sergius+ at\r\nConstantinople (Fig. 74), originally joined to a short basilica\r\ndedicated to St. Bacchus (afterward destroyed by the Turks), as in the\r\ndouble church at Kelat Seman, was built about 520; that of +San Vitale+\r\nat Ravenna was begun a few years later; both are domical churches on an\r\noctagonal plan, with an exterior aisle. Semicircular niches--four in St.\r\nSergius and eight in San Vitale--projecting into the aisle, enlarge\r\nsomewhat the area of the central space and give variety to the internal\r\neffect. The origin of this characteristic feature may be traced to the\r\neight niches of the Pantheon, through such intermediate examples as the\r\ntemple of Minerva Medica at Rome. The true pendentive does not appear in\r\nthese two churches. Timidly employed up to that time in small\r\nstructures, it received a remarkable development in the magnificent\r\nchurch of +Hagia Sophia+, built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isodorus of\r\nMiletus, under Justinian, 532-538 A.D. In the plan of this marvellous\r\nedifice (Fig. 75) the dome rests upon four mighty arches bounding a\r\nsquare, into two of which open the half-domes of semicircular apses.\r\nThese apses are penetrated and extended each by two smaller niches and a\r\ncentral arch, and the whole vast nave, measuring over 200 × 100 feet, is\r\nflanked by enormously wide aisles connecting at the front with a\r\nmajestic narthex. Huge transverse buttresses, as in the Basilica of\r\nConstantine (with whose structural design this building shows striking\r\naffinities), divide the aisles each into three sections. The plan\r\nsuggests that of St. Sergius cut in two, with a lofty dome on\r\npendentives over a square plan inserted between the halves. Thus was\r\nsecured a noble and unobstructed hall of unrivalled proportions and\r\ngreat beauty, covered by a combination of half-domes increasing in span\r\nand height as they lead up successively to the stupendous central vault,\r\nwhich rises 180 feet into the air and fitly crowns the whole. The\r\nimposing effect of this low-curved but loftily-poised dome, resting as\r\nit does upon a crown of windows, and so disposed that its summit is\r\nvisible from every point of the nave (as may be easily seen from an\r\nexamination of the section, Fig. 76), is not surpassed in any interior\r\never erected.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 77.--INTERIOR OF HAGIA SOPHIA,\r\n  CONSTANTINOPLE.]\r\n\r\nThe two lateral arches under the dome are filled by clearstory walls\r\npierced by twelve windows, and resting on arcades in two stories carried\r\nby magnificent columns taken from ancient ruins. These separate the nave\r\nfrom the side-aisles, which are in two stories forming galleries, and\r\nare vaulted with a remarkable variety of groined vaults. All the masses\r\nare disposed with studied reference to the resistance required by the\r\nmany and complex thrusts exerted by the dome and other vaults. That the\r\nearthquakes of one thousand three hundred and fifty years have not\r\ndestroyed the church is the best evidence of the sufficiency of these\r\nprecautions.\r\n\r\nNot less remarkable than the noble planning and construction of this\r\nchurch was the treatment of scale and decoration in its interior design.\r\nIt was as conspicuously the masterpiece of Byzantine architecture as the\r\nParthenon was of the classic Greek. With little external beauty, it is\r\ninternally one of the most perfectly composed and beautifully decorated\r\nhalls of worship ever erected. Instead of the simplicity of the Pantheon\r\nit displays the complexity of an organism of admirably related parts.\r\nThe division of the interior height into two stories below the spring of\r\nthe four arches, reduces the component parts of the design to moderate\r\ndimensions, so that the scale of the whole is more easily grasped and\r\nits vast size emphasized by the contrast. The walls are incrusted with\r\nprecious marbles up to the spring of the vaulting; the capitals,\r\nspandrils, and soffits are richly and minutely carved with incised\r\nornament, and all the vaults covered with splendid mosaics. Dimmed by\r\nthe lapse of centuries and disfigured by the vandalism of the Moslems,\r\nthis noble interior, by the harmony of its coloring and its impressive\r\ngrandeur, is one of the masterpieces of all time (Fig. 77).\r\n\r\n\r\n+LATER CHURCHES.+ After the sixth century no monuments were built at all\r\nrivalling in scale the creations of the former period. The later\r\nchurches were, with few exceptions, relatively small and trivial.\r\nNeither the plan nor the general aspect of Hagia Sophia seems to have\r\nbeen imitated in these later works. The crown of dome-windows was\r\nreplaced by a cylindrical drum under the dome, which was usually of\r\ninsignificant size. The exterior was treated more decoratively than\r\nbefore, by means of bands and incrustations of colored marble, or\r\nalternations of stone and brick; and internally mosaic continued to be\r\nexecuted with great skill and of great beauty until the tenth century,\r\nwhen the art rapidly declined. These later churches, of which a number\r\nwere spared by the Turks, are, therefore, generally pleasing and elegant\r\nrather than striking or imposing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 78.--PLAN OF ST. MARK’S, VENICE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 79.--INTERIOR OF ST. MARK’S.]\r\n\r\n+FOREIGN MONUMENTS.+ The influence of Byzantine art was wide-spread,\r\nboth in Europe and Asia. The leading city of civilization through the\r\nDark Ages, Constantinople influenced Italy through her political and\r\ncommercial relations with Ravenna, Genoa, and Venice. The church of +St.\r\nMark+ in the latter city was one result of this influence (Figs. 78,\r\n79). Begun in 1063 to replace an earlier church destroyed by fire, it\r\nreceived through several centuries additions not always Byzantine in\r\ncharacter. Yet it was mainly the work of Byzantine builders, who copied\r\nmost probably the church of the Apostles at Constantinople, built by\r\nJustinian. The picturesque but wholly unstructural use of columns in the\r\nentrance porches, the upper parts of the façade, the wooden cupolas over\r\nthe five domes, and the pointed arches in the narthex, are deviations\r\nfrom Byzantine traditions dating in part from the later Middle Ages\r\nNothing could well be conceived more irrational, from a structural point\r\nof view, than the accumulation of columns in the entrance-arches; but\r\nthe total effect is so picturesque and so rich in color, that its\r\narchitectural defects are easily overlooked. The external veneering of\r\nwhite and colored marble occurs rarely in the East, but became a\r\nfavorite practice in Venice, where it continued in use for five hundred\r\nyears. The interior of St. Mark’s, in some respects better preserved\r\nthan that of Hagia Sophia, is especially fine in color, though not equal\r\nin scale and grandeur to the latter church. With its five domes it has\r\nless unity of effect than Hagia Sophia, but more of the charm of\r\npicturesqueness, and its less brilliant and simpler lighting enhances\r\nthe impressiveness of its more modest dimensions.\r\n\r\nIn Russia and Greece the Byzantine style has continued to be the\r\nofficial style of the Greek Church. The Russian monuments are for the\r\nmost part of a somewhat fantastic aspect, the Muscovite taste having\r\nintroduced many innovations in the form of bulbous domes and other\r\neccentric details. In Greece there are few large churches, and some of\r\nthe most interesting, like the Cathedral at Athens, are almost toy-like\r\nin their diminutiveness. On +Mt. Athos+ (Hagion Oros) is an ancient\r\nmonastery which still retains its Byzantine character and traditions. In\r\nArmenia (as at Ani, Etchmiadzin, etc.) are also interesting examples of\r\nlate Armeno-Byzantine architecture, showing applications to exterior\r\ncarved detail of elaborate interlaced ornament looking like a re-echo of\r\nCeltic MSS. illumination, itself, no doubt, originating in Byzantine\r\ntraditions. But the greatest and most prolific offspring of Byzantine\r\narchitecture appeared after the fall of Constantinople (1453) in the new\r\nmosque-architecture of the victorious Turks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS.+ CONSTANTINOPLE: St. Sergius, 520; Hagia Sophia,\r\n  532-538; Holy Apostles by Justinian (demolished); Holy Peace (St.\r\n  Irene) originally by Constantine, rebuilt by Justinian, and again\r\n  in 8th century by Leo the Isaurian; Hagia Theotokos, 12th century\r\n  (?); Monétes Choras (“Kahiré Djami”), 10th century; Pantokrator;\r\n  “Fetiyeh Djami.” Cisterns, especially the “Bin Bir Direk” (1,001\r\n  columns) and “Yere Batan Serai;” palaces, few vestiges except the\r\n  great hall of the Blachernæ palace.

The new\r\narchitectural styles which grew up in the wake of these conquests,\r\nthough differing widely in conception and detail in the several\r\ncountries, were yet marked by common characteristics which set them\r\nquite apart from the contemporary Christian styles. The predominance of\r\ndecorative over structural considerations, a predilection for minute\r\nsurface-ornament, the absence of pictures and sculpture, are found alike\r\nin Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian buildings, though in varying\r\ndegree. These new styles, however, were almost entirely the handiwork of\r\nartisans belonging to the conquered races, and many traces of Byzantine,\r\nand even after the Crusades, of Norman and Gothic design, are\r\nrecognizable in Moslem architecture. But the Orientalism of the\r\nconquerors and their common faith, tinged with the poetry and\r\nphilosophic mysticism of the Arab, stamped these works of Copts,\r\nSyrians, and Greeks with an unmistakable character of their own, neither\r\nByzantine nor Early Christian.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ARABIC ARCHITECTURE.+ In the building of mosques and tombs, especially\r\nat Cairo, this architecture reached a remarkable degree of decorative\r\nelegance, and sometimes of dignity. It developed slowly, the Arabs not\r\nbeing at the outset a race of builders. The early monuments of Syria and\r\nEgypt were insignificant, and the sacred _Kaabah_ at Mecca and the\r\nmosque at Medina hardly deserve to be called architectural monuments at\r\nall. The most important early works were the mosques of +’Amrou+ at\r\nCairo (642, rebuilt and enlarged early in the eighth century), of +El\r\nAksah+ on the Temple platform at Jerusalem (691, by Abd-el-Melek), and\r\nof +El Walid+ at Damascus (705-732, recently seriously injured by fire).\r\nAll these were simple one-storied structures, with flat wooden roofs\r\ncarried on parallel ranges of columns supporting pointed arches, the\r\narcades either closing one side of a square court, or surrounding it\r\ncompletely. The long perspectives of the aisles and the minute\r\ndecoration of the archivolts and ceilings alone gave them architectural\r\ncharacter. The beautiful +Dome of the Rock+ (Kubbet-es-Sakhrah,\r\nmiscalled the Mosque of Omar) on the Temple platform at Jerusalem is\r\neither a remodelled Constantinian edifice, or in large part composed of\r\nthe materials of one (see p. 116).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 80.--MOSQUE OF SULTAN HASSAN, CAIRO: SANCTUARY.\r\n  a, _Mihrâb_, b, _Mimber_.]\r\n\r\nThe splendid mosque of +Ibn Touloun+ (876-885) was built on the same\r\nplan as that of Amrou, but with cantoned piers instead of columns and a\r\ncorresponding increase in variety of perspective and richness of effect.\r\nWith the incoming of the Fatimite dynasty, however, and the foundation\r\nof the present city of Cairo (971), vaulting began to take the place of\r\nwooden ceilings, and then appeared the germs of those extraordinary\r\napplications of geometry to decorative design which were henceforth to\r\nbe the most striking feature of Arabic ornament. Under the Ayûb dynasty,\r\nwhich began with Salâh-ed-din (Saladin) in 1172, these elements, of\r\nwhich the great +Barkouk+ mosque (1149) is the most imposing early\r\nexample, developed slowly in the domical tombs of the _Karafah_ at\r\nCairo, and prepared the way for the increasing richness and splendor of\r\na long series of mosques, among which those of +Kalaoun+ (1284-1318),\r\n+Sultan Hassan+ (1356), +El Mu’ayyad+ (1415), and +Kaîd Bey+ (1463),\r\nwere the most conspicuous examples (Fig. 80). They mark, indeed,\r\nsuccessive advances in complexity of planning, ingenuity of\r\nconstruction, and elegance of decoration. Together they constitute an\r\nepoch in Arabic architecture, which coincides closely with the\r\ndevelopment of Gothic vaulted architecture in Europe, both in the stages\r\nand the duration of its advances.\r\n\r\nThe mosques of these three centuries are, like the mediæval monasteries,\r\nimpressive aggregations of buildings of various sorts about a central\r\ncourt of ablutions. The tomb of the founder, residences for the _imams_,\r\nor priests, schools (_madrassah_), and hospitals (_mâristân_) rival in\r\nimportance the prayer-chamber. This last is, however, the real focus of\r\ninterest and splendor; in some cases, as in Sultan Hassan, it is a\r\nsimple barrel-vaulted chamber open to the court; in others an oblong\r\narcaded hall with many small domes; or again, a square hall covered with\r\na high pointed dome on pendentives of intricately beautiful\r\nstalactite-work (see below). The ceremonial requirements of the mosque\r\nwere simple. The-court must have its fountain of ablutions in the\r\ncentre. The prayer-hall, or mosque proper, must have its _mihrâb_, or\r\nniche, to indicate the _kibleh_, the direction of Mecca; and its\r\n_mimber_, or high, slender pulpit for the reading of the Kôran. These\r\nwere the only absolutely indispensable features of a mosque, but as\r\nearly as the ninth century the _minaret_ was added, from which the call\r\nto prayer could be sounded over the city by the _mueddin_. Not until the\r\nAyubite period, however, did it begin to assume those forms of varied\r\nand picturesque grace which lend to Cairo so much of its architectural\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.+ While Arabic architecture, in Syria and Egypt\r\nalike, possesses more decorative than constructive originality, the\r\nbeautiful forms of its domes, pendentives, and minarets, the simple\r\nmajesty of the great pointed barrel-vaults of the Hassan mosque and\r\nsimilar monuments, and the graceful lines of the universally used\r\npointed arch, prove the Coptic builders and their later Arabic\r\nsuccessors to have been architects of great ability. The Arabic domes,\r\nas seen both in the mosques and in the remarkable group of tombs\r\ncommonly called “tombs of the Khalîfs,” are peculiar not only in their\r\npointed outlines and their rich external decoration of interlaced\r\ngeometric motives, but still more in the external and internal treatment\r\nof the pendentives, exquisitely decorated with stalactite ornament. This\r\nornament, derived, no doubt, from a combination of minute corbels with\r\nrows of small niches, and presumably of Persian origin, was finally\r\ndeveloped into a system of extraordinary intricacy, applicable alike to\r\nthe topping of a niche or panel, as in the great doorways of the\r\nmosques, and to the bracketing out of minaret galleries (Figs. 81, 82).\r\nIts applications show a bewildering variety of forms and an\r\nextraordinary aptitude for intricate geometrical design.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 81.--MOSQUE OF KAÎD BEY, CAIRO]\r\n\r\n\r\n+DECORATION.+ Geometry, indeed, vied with the love of color in its hold\r\non the Arabic taste. Ceiling-beams were carved into highly ornamental\r\nforms before receiving their rich color-decoration of red, green, blue,\r\nand gold. The doors and the _mimber_ were framed in geometric patterns\r\nwith slender intersecting bars forming complicated star-panelling. The\r\nvoussoirs of arches were cut into curious interlocking forms; doorways\r\nand niches were covered with stalactite corbelling, and pavements and\r\nwall-incrustations, whether of marble or tiling, combined brilliancy and\r\nharmony of color with the perplexing beauty of interlaced\r\nstar-and-polygon patterns of marvellous intricacy. Stained glass added\r\nto the interior color-effect, the patterns being perforated in plaster,\r\nwith a bit of colored glass set into each perforation--a device not very\r\ndurable, perhaps, but singularly decorative.\r\n\r\n\r\n+OTHER WORKS.+ Few of the mediæval Arabic palaces have remained to our\r\ntime. That they were adorned with a splendid prodigality appears from\r\ncontemporary accounts. This splendor was internal rather than external;\r\nthe palace, like all the larger and richer dwellings in the East,\r\nsurrounded one or more courts, and presented externally an almost\r\nunbroken wall. The fountain in the chief court, the _diwân_ (a great,\r\nvaulted reception-chamber opening upon the court and raised slightly\r\nabove it), the _dâr_, or men’s court, rigidly separated from the\r\n_hareem_ for the women, were and are universal elements in these great\r\ndwellings. The more common city-houses show as their most striking\r\nfeatures successively corbelled-out stories and broad wooden eaves, with\r\nlattice-screens covering single windows, or almost a whole façade,\r\ncomposed of turned work (_mashrabiyya_), in designs of great beauty.\r\n\r\nThe fountains, gates, and minor works of the Arabs display the same\r\nbeauty in decoration and color, the same general forms and details which\r\ncharacterize the larger works, but it is impossible here to\r\nparticularize further with regard to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n+MORESQUE.+ Elsewhere in Northern Africa the Arabs produced no such\r\nimportant works as in Egypt, nor is the architecture of the other Moslem\r\nstates so well preserved or so well known. Constructive design would\r\nappear to have been there even more completely subordinated to\r\ndecoration; tiling and plaster-relief took the place of more\r\narchitectural elements and materials, while horseshoe and cusped arches\r\nwere substituted for the simpler and more architectural pointed arch\r\n(Fig. 82). The courts of palaces and public buildings were surrounded by\r\nranges of horseshoe arches on slender columns; these last being provided\r\nwith capitals of a form rarely seen in Cairo. Towers were built of much\r\nmore massive design than the Cairo minarets, usually with a square,\r\nalmost solid shaft and a more open lantern at the top, sometimes in\r\nseveral diminishing stories.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 82.--MOORISH DETAIL, ALHAMBRA.\r\n  _Showing stalactite and perforated work, Moorish cusped arch,\r\n  Hispano-Moresque capitals, and decorative inscriptions._]\r\n\r\n\r\n+HISPANO-MORESQUE.+ The most splendid phase of this branch of Arabic\r\narchitecture is found not in Africa but in Spain, which was overrun in\r\n710-713 by the Moors, who established there the independent Khalifate of\r\nCordova. This was later split up into petty kingdoms, of which the most\r\nimportant were Granada, Seville, Toledo, and Valencia. This\r\ndismemberment of the Khalifate led in time to the loss of these cities,\r\nwhich were one by one recovered by the Christians during the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries; the capture of Granada, in 1492, finally\r\ndestroying the Moorish rule.\r\n\r\nThe dominion of the Moors in Spain was marked by a high civilization and\r\nan extraordinary activity in building. The style they introduced became\r\nthe national style in the regions they occupied, and even after the\r\nexpulsion of the Moors was used in buildings erected by Christians and\r\nby Jews. The “House of Pilate,” at Seville, is an example of this, and\r\nthe general use of the Moorish style in Jewish synagogues, down to our\r\nown day, both in Spain and abroad, originated in the erection of\r\nsynagogues for the Jews in Spain by Moorish artisans and in Moorish\r\nstyle, both during and after the period of Moslem supremacy.\r\n\r\nBesides innumerable mosques, castles, bridges, aqueducts, gates, and\r\nfountains, the Moors erected several monuments of remarkable size and\r\nmagnificence. Specially worthy of notice among them are the Great Mosque\r\nat Cordova, the Alcazars of Seville and Malaga, the Giralda at Seville,\r\nand the Alhambra at Granada.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 83.--INTERIOR OF THE GREAT MOSQUE AT CORDOVA.]\r\n\r\nThe +Mosque at Cordova+, begun in 786 by ‘Abd-er-Rahman, enlarged in\r\n876, and again by El Mansour in 976, is a vast arcaded hall 375 feet ×\r\n420 feet in extent, but only 30 feet high (Fig. 83). The rich wooden\r\nceiling rests upon seventeen rows of thirty to thirty-three columns\r\neach, and two intersecting rows of piers, all carrying horseshoe arches\r\nin two superposed ranges, a large portion of those about the sanctuary\r\nbeing cusped, the others plain, except for the alternation of color in\r\nthe voussoirs. The _mihrâb_ niche is particularly rich in its minutely\r\ncarved incrustations and mosaics, and a dome ingeniously formed by\r\nintersecting ribs covers the sanctuary before it. This form of dome\r\noccurs frequently in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe +Alcazars+ at Seville and Malaga, which have been restored in recent\r\nyears, present to-day a fairly correct counterpart of the castle-palaces\r\nof the thirteenth century. They display the same general conceptions and\r\ndecorative features as the Alhambra, which they antedate. The +Giralda+\r\nat Seville is, on the other hand, unique. It is a lofty rectangular\r\ntower, its exterior panelled and covered with a species of\r\nquarry-ornament in relief; it terminated originally in two or three\r\ndiminishing stages or lanterns, which were replaced in the sixteenth\r\ncentury by the present Renaissance belfry.\r\n\r\nThe +Alhambra+ is universally considered to be the masterpiece of\r\nHispano-Moresque art, partly no doubt on account of its excellent\r\npreservation. It is most interesting as an example of the splendid\r\ncitadel-palaces built by the Moorish conquerors, as well as for its\r\ngorgeous color-decoration of minute quarry-ornament stamped or moulded\r\nin the wet plaster wherever the walls are not wainscoted with tiles. It\r\nwas begun in 1248 by Mohammed-ben-Al-Hamar, enlarged in 1279 by his\r\nsuccessor, and again in 1306, when its mosque was built. Its plan (Fig.\r\n84) shows two large courts and a smaller one next the mosque, with three\r\ngreat square chambers and many of minor importance. Light arcades\r\nsurround the Court of the Lions with its fountain, and adorn the ends of\r\nthe other chief court; and the stalactite pendentive, rare in Moorish\r\nwork, appears in the “Hall of Ambassadors” and some other parts of the\r\nedifice. But its chief glory is its ornamentation, less durable, less\r\narchitectural than that of the Cairene buildings, but making up for this\r\nin delicacy and richness. Minute vine-patterns and Arabic inscriptions\r\nare interwoven with waving intersecting lines, forming a net-like\r\nframework, to all of which deep red, blue, black, and gold give an\r\nindescribable richness of effect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 84.--PLAN OF THE ALHAMBRA.\r\n  A, _Hall of Ambassadors_; a, _Mosque_; b, _Court of Mosque_;\r\n  c, _Sala della Barca_; _d, d_, _Baths_; e, _Hall of the\r\n  Two Sisters_; _f, f, f_, _Hall of the Tribunal_;\r\n  g, _Hall of the Abencerrages_.]\r\n\r\nThe Moors also overran Sicily in the eighth century, but while their\r\narchitecture there profoundly influenced that of the Christians who\r\nrecovered Sicily in 1090, and copied the style of the conquered Moslems,\r\nthere is too little of the original Moorish architecture remaining to\r\nclaim mention here.\r\n\r\n\r\n+SASSANIAN.+ The Sassanian empire, which during the four centuries from\r\n226 to 641 A.D. had withstood Rome and extended its own sway almost to\r\nIndia, left on Persian soil a number of interesting monuments which\r\npowerfully influenced the Mohammedan style of that region. The Sassanian\r\nbuildings appear to have been principally palaces, and were all vaulted.\r\nWith their long barrel-vaulted halls, combined with square domical\r\nchambers, as in Firouz-Abad and Serbistan, they exhibit reminiscences of\r\nantique Assyrian tradition. The ancient Persian use of columns was\r\nalmost entirely abandoned, but doors and windows were still treated with\r\nthe banded frames and cavetto-cornices of Persepolis and Susa. The\r\nSassanians employed with these exterior details others derived perhaps\r\nfrom Syrian and Byzantine sources. A sort of engaged buttress-column and\r\nblind arches repeated somewhat aimlessly over a whole façade were\r\ncharacteristic features; still more so the huge arches, elliptical or\r\nhorse-shoe shaped, which formed the entrances to these palaces, as in\r\nthe Tâk-Kesra at Ctesiphon. Ornamental details of a debased Roman type\r\nappear, mingled with more gracefully flowing leaf-patterns resembling\r\nearly Christian Syrian carving. The last great monument of this style\r\nwas the palace at Mashita in Moab, begun by the last Chosroes (627), but\r\nnever finished, an imposing and richly ornamented structure about 500 ×\r\n170 feet, occupying the centre of a great court.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PERSIAN-MOSLEM ARCHITECTURE.+ These Sassanian palaces must have\r\nstrongly influenced Persian architecture after the Arab conquest in 641.\r\nFor although the architecture of the first six centuries after that date\r\nsuffered almost absolute extinction at the hands of the Mongols under\r\nGenghis Khan, the traces of Sassanian influence are still perceptible in\r\nthe monuments that rose in the following centuries. The dome and vault,\r\nthe colossal portal-arches, and the use of brick and tile are evidences\r\nof this influence, bearing no resemblance to Byzantine or Arabic types.\r\nThe Moslem monuments of Persia, so far as their dates can be\r\nascertained, are all subsequent to 1200, unless tradition is correct in\r\nassigning to the time of Haroun Ar Rashid (786) certain curious tombs\r\nnear Bagdad with singular pyramidal roofs. The ruined mosque at Tabriz\r\n(1300), and the beautiful domical +Tomb+ at +Sultaniyeh+ (1313) belong\r\nto the Mogul period. They show all the essential features of the later\r\narchitecture of the Sufis (1499-1694), during whose dynastic period were\r\nbuilt the still more splendid and more celebrated +Meidan+ or square,\r\nthe great mosque of Mesjid Shah, the Bazaar and the College or Medress\r\nof Hussein Shah, all at Ispahan, and many other important monuments at\r\nIspahan, Bagdad, and Teheran. In these structures four elements\r\nespecially claim attention; the pointed bulbous dome, the round minaret,\r\nthe portal-arch rising above the adjacent portions of the building, and\r\nthe use of enamelled terra-cotta tiles as an external decoration. To\r\nthese may be added the ogee arch (_ogee_ = double-reversed curve), as an\r\noccasional feature. The vaulting is most ingenious and beautiful, and\r\nits forms, whether executed in brick or in plaster, are sufficiently\r\nvaried without resort to the perplexing complications of stalactite\r\nwork. In Persian decoration the most striking qualities are the harmony\r\nof blended color, broken up into minute patterns and more subdued in\r\ntone than in the Hispano-Moresque, and the preference of flowing lines\r\nand floral ornament to the geometric puzzles of Arabic design. Persian\r\narchitecture influenced both Turkish and Indo-Moslem art, which owe to\r\nit a large part of their decorative charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n+INDO-MOSLEM.+ The Mohammedan architecture of India is so distinct from\r\nall the native Indian styles and so related to the art of Persia, if not\r\nto that of the Arabs, that it properly belongs here rather than in the\r\nlater chapter on Oriental styles. It was in the eleventh century that\r\nthe states of India first began to fall before Mohammedan invaders, but\r\nnot until the end of the fifteenth century that the great Mogul dynasty\r\nwas established in Hindostan as the dominant power. During the\r\nintervening period local schools of Moslem architecture were developing\r\nin the Pathan country of Northern India (1193-1554), in Jaunpore and\r\nGujerat (1396-1572), in Scinde, where Persian influence predominated; in\r\nKalburgah and Bidar (1347-1426). These schools differed considerably in\r\nspirit and detail; but under the Moguls (1494-1706) there was less\r\ndiversity, and to this dynasty we owe many of the most magnificent\r\nmosques and tombs of India, among which those of Bijapur retain a marked\r\nand distinct style of their own.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 85.--TOMB OF MAHMUD, BIJAPUR. SECTION.]\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedan monuments of India are characterized by a grandeur and\r\namplitude of disposition, a symmetry and monumental dignity of design\r\nwhich distinguishes them widely from the picturesque but sometimes\r\ntrivial buildings of the Arabs and Moors. Less dependent on color than\r\nthe Moorish or Persian structures, they are usually built of marble, or\r\nof marble and sandstone, giving them an air of permanence and solidity\r\nwanting in other Moslem styles except the Turkish. The dome, the round\r\nminaret, the pointed arch, and the colossal portal-arch, are universal,\r\nas in Persia, and enamelled tiles are also used, but chiefly for\r\ninterior decoration. Externally the more dignified if less resplendent\r\ndecoration of surface carving is used, in patterns of minute and\r\ngraceful scrolls, leaf forms, and Arabic inscriptions covering large\r\nsurfaces. The Arabic stalactite pendentive star-panelling and\r\ngeometrical interlace are rarely if ever seen. The dome on the square\r\nplan is almost universal, but neither the Byzantine nor the Arabic\r\npendentive is used, striking and original combinations of vaulting\r\nsurfaces, of corner squinches, of corbelling and ribs, being used in its\r\nplace. Many of the Pathan domes and arches at Delhi, Ajmir, Ahmedabad,\r\nShepree, etc., are built in horizontal or corbelled courses supported on\r\nslender columns, and exert no thrust at all, so that they are vaults\r\nonly in form, like the dome of the Tholos of Atreus (Fig. 24). The most\r\nimposing and original of all Indian domes are those of the +Jumma\r\nMusjid+ and of the +Tomb of Mahmud+, both at Bijapur, the latter 137\r\nfeet in span (Fig. 85). These two monuments, indeed, with the Mogul Taj\r\nMahal at Agra, not only deserve the first rank among Indian monuments,\r\nbut in constructive science combined with noble proportions and\r\nexquisite beauty are hardly, if at all, surpassed by the greatest\r\ntriumphs of western art. The Indo-Moslem architects, moreover,\r\nespecially those of the Mogul period, excelled in providing artistic\r\nsettings for their monuments. Immense platforms, superb courts, imposing\r\nflights of steps, noble gateways, minarets to mark the angles of\r\nenclosures, and landscape gardening of a high order, enhance greatly the\r\neffect of the great mosques, tombs, and palaces of Agra, Delhi,\r\nFuttehpore Sikhri, Allahabad, Secundra, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most notable monuments of the Moguls are the +Mosque of Akbar+\r\n(1556-1605) at Futtehpore Sikhri, the tomb of that sultan at Secundra,\r\nand his palace at Allahabad; the +Pearl Mosque+ at Agra and the +Jumma\r\nMusjid+ at Delhi, one of the largest and noblest of Indian mosques, both\r\nbuilt by Shah Jehan about 1650; his immense but now ruined palace in the\r\nsame city; and finally the unrivalled mausoleum, the +Taj Mahal+ at\r\nAgra, built during his lifetime as a festal hall, to serve as his tomb\r\nafter death (Fig. 86). This last is the pearl of Indian architecture,\r\nthough it is said to have been designed by a European architect, French\r\nor Italian. It is a white marble structure 185 feet square, centred in a\r\ncourt 313 feet square, forming a platform 18 feet high. The corners of\r\nthis court are marked by elegant minarets, and the whole is dominated by\r\nthe exquisite white marble dome, 58 feet in diameter, 80 feet high,\r\ninternally rising over four domical corner chapels, and covered\r\nexternally by a lofty marble bulb-dome on a high drum. The rich\r\nmaterials, beautiful execution, and exquisite inlaying of this mausoleum\r\nare worthy of its majestic design. On the whole, in the architecture of\r\nthe Moguls in Bijapur, Agra, and Delhi, Mohammedan architecture reaches\r\nits highest expression in the totality and balance of its qualities of\r\nconstruction, composition, detail, ornament, and settings. The later\r\nmonuments show the decline of the style, and though often rich and\r\nimposing, are lacking in refinement and originality.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 86.--TAJ MAHAL, AGRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+TURKISH.+ The Ottoman Turks, who began their conquering career under\r\nOsman I. in Bithynia in 1299, had for a century been occupying the\r\nfairest portions of the Byzantine empire when, in 1453, they became\r\nmasters of Constantinople. Hagia Sophia was at once occupied as their\r\nchief mosque, and such of the other churches as were spared, were\r\ndivided between the victors and the vanquished. The conqueror, Mehmet\r\nII., at the same time set about the building of a new mosque, entrusting\r\nthe design to a Byzantine, Christodoulos, whom he directed to reproduce,\r\nwith some modifications, the design of the “Great Church”--Hagia Sophia.\r\nThe type thus officially adopted has ever since remained the controlling\r\nmodel of Turkish mosque design, so far, at least, as general plan and\r\nconstructive principles are concerned. Thus the conquering Turks,\r\neducated by a century of study and imitation of Byzantine models in\r\nBrusa, Nicomedia, Smyrna, Adrianople, and other cities earlier\r\nsubjugated, did what the Byzantines had, during nine centuries, failed\r\nto do. The noble idea first expressed by Anthemius and Isidorus in the\r\nChurch of Hagia Sophia had remained undeveloped, unimitated by later\r\narchitects. It was the Turk who first seized upon its possibilities, and\r\ndeveloped therefrom a style of architecture less sumptuous in color and\r\ndecoration than the sister styles of Persia, Cairo, or India, but of\r\ngreat nobility and dignity, notwithstanding. The low-curved dome with\r\nits crown of buttressed windows, the plain spherical pendentives, the\r\ngreat apses at each end, covered by half-domes and penetrated by smaller\r\nniches, the four massive piers with their projecting buttress-masses\r\nextending across the broad lateral aisles, the narthex and the arcaded\r\natrium in front--all these appear in the great Turkish mosques of\r\nConstantinople. In the Conqueror’s mosque, however, two apses with\r\nhalf-domes replace the lateral galleries and clearstory of Hagia Sophia,\r\nmaking a perfectly quadripartite plan, destitute of the emphasis and\r\nsignificance of a plan drawn on one main axis (Fig. 87). The same\r\ntreatment occurs in the mosque of Ahmed I., the +Ahmediyeh+ (1608; Fig.\r\n88), and the +Yeni Djami+ (“New Mosque”) at the port (1665). In the\r\nmosque of +Osman III.+ (1755) the reverse change was effected; the\r\nmosque has no great apses, four clearstories filling the four arches\r\nunder the dome, as also in several of the later and smaller mosques. The\r\ngreatest and noblest of the Turkish mosques, the +Suleimaniyeh+, built\r\nin 1553 by Soliman the Magnificent, returned to the Byzantine\r\ncombination of two half-domes with two clearstories (Fig. 89).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 87.--MOSQUE OF MEHMET II., CONSTANTINOPLE.\r\n  PLAN.\r\n  (The dimensions figured in metres.)]\r\n\r\nIn none of these monuments is there the internal magnificence of marble\r\nand mosaic of the Byzantine churches. These are only in a measure\r\nreplaced by Persian tile-wainscoting and stained-glass windows of the\r\nArabic type. The division into stories and the treatment of scale are\r\nless well managed than in the Hagia Sophia; on the other hand, the\r\nproportion of height to width is generally admirable. The exterior\r\ntreatment is unique and effective, far superior to the Byzantine\r\npractice. The massing of domes and half-domes and roofs is more\r\nartistically arranged; and while there is little of that minute carved\r\ndetail found in Egypt and India, the composition of the lateral arcades,\r\nthe simple but impressive domical peristyles of the courts, and the\r\ngraceful forms of the pointed arches, with alternating voussoirs of\r\nwhite and black marble, are artistic in a high degree. The minarets are,\r\nhowever, inferior to those of Indian, Persian, and Arabic art, though\r\ngraceful in their proportions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 88.--EXTERIOR AHMEDIYEH MOSQUE.]\r\n\r\nNearly all the great mosques are accompanied by the domical tombs\r\n(_turbeh_) of their imperial founders. Some of these are of noble size\r\nand great beauty of proportion and decoration. The +Tomb of Roxelana+\r\n(Khourrem), the favorite wife of Soliman the Magnificent (1553), is the\r\nmost beautiful of all, and perhaps the most perfect gem of Turkish\r\narchitecture, with its elegant arcade surrounding the octagonal domical\r\nmausoleum-chamber. The +monumental fountains+ of Constantinople also\r\ndeserve mention. Of these, the one erected by Ahmet III. (1710), near\r\nHagia Sophia, is the most beautiful. They usually consist of a\r\nrectangular marble reservoir with pagoda-like roof and broad eaves, the\r\nfour faces of the fountain adorned each with a niche and basin, and\r\ncovered with relief carving and gilded inscriptions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 89.--INTERIOR OF SULEIMANIYEH,\r\n  CONSTANTINOPLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+PALACES.+ In this department the Turks have done little of importance.\r\nThe buildings in the Seraglio gardens are low and insignificant. The\r\n+Tchinli Kiosque+, now the Imperial Museum, is however, a simple but\r\ngraceful two-storied edifice, consisting of four vaulted chambers in the\r\nangles of a fine cruciform hall, with domes treated like those of\r\nBijapur on a small scale; the tiling and the veranda in front are\r\nparticularly elegant; the design suggests Persian handiwork. The later\r\npalaces, designed by Armenians, are picturesque white marble and stucco\r\nbuildings on the water’s edge; they possess richly decorated halls, but\r\nthe details are of a debased European rococo style, quite unworthy of an\r\nOriental monarch.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS.+ ARABIAN: “Mosque of Omar,” or Dome of the Rock, 638;\r\n  El Aksah, by ’Abd-el-Melek, 691, both at Jerusalem; Mosque ’Amrou\r\n  at Cairo, 642; mosques at Cyrene, 665; great mosque of El Walîd,\r\n  Damascus, 705-717.

The so-called Dark Ages which followed this event\r\nconstituted the formative period of the new Western civilization, during\r\nwhich the Celtic and Germanic races were being Christianized and\r\nsubjected to the authority and to the educative influences of the\r\nChurch. Under these conditions a new architecture was developed, founded\r\nupon the traditions of the early Christian builders, modified in\r\ndifferent regions by Roman or Byzantine influences. For Rome recovered\r\nearly her antique prestige, and Roman monuments covering the soil of\r\nSouthern Europe, were a constant object lesson to the builders of that\r\ntime. To this new architecture of the West, which in the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries first began to achieve worthy and monumental results,\r\nthe generic name of +Romanesque+ has been commonly given, in spite of\r\nthe great diversity of its manifestations in different countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHARACTER OF THE ARCHITECTURE.+ Romanesque architecture was\r\npre-eminently ecclesiastical. Civilization and culture emanated from the\r\nChurch, and her requirements and discipline gave form to the builder’s\r\nart. But the basilican style, which had so well served her purposes in\r\nthe earlier centuries and on classic soil, was ill-suited to the new\r\nconditions. Corinthian columns, marble incrustations, and splendid\r\nmosaics were not to be had for the asking in the forests of Gaul or\r\nGermany, nor could the Lombards and Ostrogoths in Italy or their\r\ndescendants reproduce them. The basilican style was complete in itself,\r\npossessing no seeds of further growth. The priests and monks of Italy\r\nand Western Europe sought to rear with unskilled labor churches of stone\r\nin which the general dispositions of the basilica should reappear in\r\nsimpler, more massive dress, and, as far as possible, in a fireproof\r\nconstruction with vaults of stone. This problem underlies all the varied\r\nphases of Romanesque architecture; its final solution was not, however,\r\nreached until the Gothic period, to which the Romanesque forms the\r\ntransition and stepping-stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n+MEDIÆVAL ITALY.+ Italy in the Dark Ages stood midway between the\r\ncivilization of the Eastern Empire and the semi-barbarism of the West.\r\nRome, Ravenna, and Venice early became centres of culture and maintained\r\ncontinuous commercial relations with the East. Architecture did not lack\r\neither the inspiration or the means for advancing on new lines. But its\r\nadvance was by no means the same everywhere. The unifying influence of\r\nthe church was counterbalanced by the provincialism and the local\r\ndiversities of the various Italian states, resulting in a wide variety\r\nof styles. These, however, may be broadly grouped in four divisions: the\r\n+Lombard+, the +Tuscan-Romanesque+, the +Italo-Byzantine+, and the\r\nunchanged +Basilican+ or Early Christian, which last, as was shown in\r\nChapter X., continued to be practised in Rome throughout the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 90.--INTERIOR OF SAN AMBROGIO, MILAN.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 91.--WEST FRONT AND CAMPANILE OF CATHEDRAL,\r\n  PIACENZA.]\r\n\r\n+LOMBARD STYLE.+ Owing to the general rebuilding of ancient churches\r\nunder the more settled social conditions of the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies, little remains to us of the architecture of the three\r\npreceding centuries in Italy, except the Roman basilicas and a few\r\nbaptisteries and circular churches, already mentioned in Chapter X. The\r\nso-called Lombard monuments belong mainly to the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies. They are found not only in Lombardy, but also in Venetia and\r\nthe Æmilia. Milan, Pavia, Piacenza, Bologna, and Verona were important\r\ncentres of development of this style. The churches were nearly all\r\nvaulted, but the plans were basilican, with such variations as resulted\r\nfrom efforts to meet the exigencies of vaulted construction. The nave\r\nwas narrowed, and instead of rows of columns carrying a thin clearstory\r\nwall, a few massive piers of masonry, connected by broad pier-arches,\r\nsupported the heavy ribs of the groined vaulting, as in S. Ambrogio,\r\nMilan (Fig. 90). To resist the thrust of the main vault, the clearstory\r\nwas sometimes suppressed, the side aisle carried up in two stories\r\nforming galleries, and rows of chapels added at the sides, their\r\npartitions forming buttresses. The piers were often of clustered\r\nsection, the better to receive the various arches and ribs they\r\nsupported. The vaulting was in square divisions or _vaulting-bays_, each\r\nembracing two pier-arches which met upon an intermediate pier lighter\r\nthan the others. Thus the whole aspect of the interior was\r\nrevolutionized. The lightness, spaciousness, and decorative elegance of\r\nthe basilicas were here exchanged for a sombre and massive dignity\r\nsevere in its plainness. The Choir was sometimes raised a few feet above\r\nthe nave, to allow of a crypt and _confessio_ beneath, reached by broad\r\nflights of steps from the nave. Sta. Maria della Pieve at Arezzo\r\n(9th-11th century), +S. Michele+ at Pavia (late 11th century), the\r\n+Cathedral of Piacenza+ (1122), +S. Ambrogio+ at Milan (12th century),\r\nand +S. Zeno+ at Verona (1139) are notable monuments of this style.\r\n\r\n\r\n+LOMBARD EXTERIORS.+ The few architectural embellishments employed on\r\nthe simple exteriors of the Lombard churches were usually effective and\r\nwell composed. Slender columnettes or long pilasters, blind arcades, and\r\nopen arcaded galleries under the eaves gave light and shade to these\r\nexteriors. The façades were mere frontispieces with a single broad\r\ngable, the three aisles of the church being merely suggested by flat or\r\nround pilasters dividing the front (Fig 91). Gabled porches, with\r\ncolumns resting on the backs of lions or monsters, adorned the doorways.\r\nThe carving was often of a fierce and grotesque character. Detached\r\nbell-towers or _campaniles_ adjoined many of these churches; square and\r\nsimple in mass, but with well-distributed openings and well-proportioned\r\nbelfries (Piacenza S. Zeno at Verona, etc.).[18]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: See Appendix B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE TUSCAN ROMANESQUE.+ The churches of this style (sometimes called\r\nthe +Pisan+) were less vigorous but more elegant and artistic in design\r\nthan the Lombard. They were basilicas in plan, with timber ceilings and\r\nhigh clearstories on columnar arcades. In their decoration, both\r\ninternal and external, they betray the influence of Byzantine\r\ntraditions, especially in the use of white and colored marble in\r\nalternating bands or in panelled veneering. Still more striking is the\r\nexternal decorative application of wall-arcades, sometimes occupying the\r\nwhole height of the wall and carried on flat pilasters, sometimes in\r\nsuperposed stages of small arches on slender columns standing free of\r\nthe wall. In general the decorative element prevailed over the\r\nconstructive in the design of these picturesquely beautiful churches,\r\nsome of which are of noble size. The +Duomo+ (cathedral) of +Pisa+,\r\nbuilt 1063-1118, is the finest monument of the style (Figs. 92, 93). It\r\nis 312 feet long and 118 wide, with long transepts and an elliptical\r\ndome of later date over the _crossing_ (the intersection of nave and\r\ntransepts). Its richly arcaded front and banded flanks strikingly\r\nexemplify the illogical and unconstructive but highly decorative methods\r\nof the Tuscan Romanesque builders. The circular +Baptistery+ (1153),\r\nwith its lofty domical central hall surrounded by an aisle, an imposing\r\ndevelopment of the type established by Constantine (p. 111), and the\r\nfamous +Leaning Tower+ (1174), both designed with external arcading,\r\ncombine with the Duomo to form the most remarkable group of\r\necclesiastical buildings in Italy, if not in Europe (Fig. 92).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 92.--BAPTISTERY, CATHEDRAL,\r\n  AND LEANING TOWER, PISA.]\r\n\r\nThe same style appears in more flamboyant shape in some of the churches\r\nof Lucca. The cathedral +S. Martino+ (1060; façade, 1204; nave altered\r\nin fourteenth century) is the finest and largest of these; +S. Michele+\r\n(façade, 1288) and S. Frediano (twelfth century) have the most\r\nelaborately decorated façades. The same principles of design appear in\r\nthe cathedral and several other churches in Pistoia and Prato; but these\r\nbelong, for the most part, to the Gothic period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 93.--INTERIOR OF PISA CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+FLORENCE.+ The church of +S. Miniato+, in the suburbs of Florence, is a\r\nbeautiful example of a modification of the Pisan style. It is in plan a\r\nbasilica with two piers interrupting the colonnade on each side of the\r\nnave and supporting powerful transverse arches. The interior is\r\nembellished with bands and patterns in black and white, and the woodwork\r\nof the open-timber roof is elegantly decorated with fine patterns in\r\nred, green, blue, and gold--a treatment common in early mediæval\r\nchurches, as at Messina, Orvieto, etc. The exterior is adorned with\r\nwall-arches of classic design and with panelled veneering in white and\r\ndark marble, instead of the horizontal bands of the Pisan churches. This\r\nsystem of external decoration, a blending of Pisan and Italo-Byzantine\r\nmethods, became the established practice in Florence, lasting through\r\nthe whole Gothic period. The +Baptistery+ of Florence, originally the\r\ncathedral, an imposing polygonal domical edifice of the tenth century,\r\npresents externally one of the most admirable examples of this practice.\r\nIts marble veneering in black and white, with pilasters and arches of\r\nexcellent design, is attributed by Vasari to Arnolfo di Cambio, but is\r\nby many considered to be much older, although restored by that architect\r\nin 1294.\r\n\r\nSuggestions of the Pisan arcade system are found in widely scattered\r\nexamples in the east and south of Italy, mingled with features of\r\nLombard and Byzantine design. In Apulia, as at Bari, Caserta Vecchia\r\n(1100), Molfetta (1192), and in Sicily, the Byzantine influence is\r\nconspicuous in the use of domes and in many of the decorative details.\r\nParticularly is this the case at Palermo and Monreale, where the\r\nchurches erected after the Norman conquest--some of them domical, some\r\nbasilican--show a strange but picturesque and beautiful mixture of\r\nRomanesque, Byzantine, and Arabic forms. The +Cathedral+ of +Monreale+\r\nand the churches of the +Eremiti+ and +La Martorana+ at Palermo are the\r\nmost important.\r\n\r\nThe +Italo-Byzantine+ style has already found mention in the latter part\r\nof Chapter XI. Venice and Ravenna were its chief centres; while the\r\ninfluence, both of the parent style and of its Italian offshoot was, as\r\nwe have just shown, very widespread.\r\n\r\n\r\n+WESTERN ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE.+ In Western Europe the unrest and\r\nlawlessness which attended the unsettled relations of society under the\r\nfeudal system long retarded the establishment of that social order\r\nwithout which architectural progress is impossible. With the eleventh\r\ncentury there began, however, a great activity in building, principally\r\namong the monasteries, which represented all that there was of culture\r\nand stability amid the prevailing disorder. Undisturbed by war, the only\r\nabodes of peaceful labor, learning, and piety, they had become rich and\r\npowerful, both in men and land. Probably the more or less general\r\napprehension of the supposed impending end of the world in the year 1000\r\ncontributed to this result by driving unquiet consciences to seek refuge\r\nin the monasteries, or to endow them richly.\r\n\r\nThe monastic builders, with little technical training, but with plenty\r\nof willing hands, sought out new architectural paths to meet their\r\nspecial needs. Remote from classic and Byzantine models, and mainly\r\ndependent on their own resources, they often failed to realize the\r\nintended results. But skill came with experience, and with advancing\r\ncivilization and a surer mastery of construction came a finer taste and\r\ngreater elegance of design. Meanwhile military architecture developed a\r\nnew science of building, and covered Europe with imposing castles,\r\nadmirably constructed and often artistic in design as far as military\r\nexigencies would permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHARACTER OF THE STYLE.+ The Romanesque architecture of the eleventh\r\nand twelfth centuries in Western Europe (sometimes called the\r\n+Round-Arched Gothic+) was thus predominantly though not exclusively\r\nmonastic. This gave it a certain unity of character in spite of national\r\nand local variations. The problem which the wealthy orders set\r\nthemselves was, like that of the Lombard church-builders in Italy, to\r\nadapt the basilica plan to the exigencies of vaulted construction.\r\nMassive walls, round arches stepped or recessed to lighten their\r\nappearance, heavy mouldings richly carved, clustered piers and\r\njamb-shafts, capitals either of the _cushion_ type or imitated from the\r\nCorinthian, and strong and effective carving--all these are features\r\nalike of French, German, English, and Spanish Romanesque architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 94.--PLAN OF ST. FRONT.]\r\n\r\n+THE FRENCH ROMANESQUE.+ Though monasticism produced remarkable results\r\nin France, architecture there did not wholly depend upon the\r\nmonasteries. Southern Gaul (Provence) was full of classic remains and\r\nclassic traditions while at the same time it maintained close trade\r\nrelations with Venice and the East.[19] The church of +St. Front+ at\r\nPerigueux, built in 1120, reproduced the plan of St. Mark’s with\r\nsingular fidelity, but without its rich decoration, and with pointed\r\ninstead of round arches (Figs. 94, 95). The domical cathedral of\r\n+Cahors+ (1050-1100), an obvious imitation of S. Irene at\r\nConstantinople, and the later and more Gothic Cathedral of +Angoulême+\r\ndisplay a notable advance in architectural skill outside of the\r\nmonasteries. Among the abbeys, +Fontevrault+ (1101-1119) closely\r\nresembles Angoulême, but surpasses it in the elegance of its choir and\r\nchapels. In these and a number of other domical churches of the same\r\nFranco-Byzantine type in Aquitania, the substitution of the Latin cross\r\nin the plan for the Greek cross used in St. Front, evinces the Gallic\r\ntendency to work out to their logical end new ideas or new applications\r\nof old ones. These striking variations on Byzantine themes might have\r\ndeveloped into an independent local style but for the overwhelming tide\r\nof Gothic influence which later poured in from the North.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: See Viollet-le-Duc, _Dictionnaire raisonné_, article\r\n    ARCHITECTURE, vol. i., pp. 66 _et seq._; also de Verneilh,\r\n    _L’Architecture byzantine en France_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 95.--INTERIOR OF ST. FRONT, PERIGUEUX.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, farther south (at Arles, Avignon, etc.), classic models\r\nstrongly influenced the details, if not the plans, of an interesting\r\nseries of churches remarkable especially for their porches rich with\r\nfigure sculpture and for their elaborately carved details. The classic\r\narchivolt, the Corinthian capital, the Roman forms of enriched\r\nmouldings, are evident at a glance in the porches of Notre Dame des Doms\r\nat Avignon, of the church of St. Gilles, and of St. Trophime at Arles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 96.--PLAN OF NOTRE DAME DU PORT, CLERMONT.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 97.--SECTION OF NOTRE DAME DU PORT, CLERMONT.]\r\n\r\n+DEVELOPMENT OF VAULTING.+ It was in Central France, and mainly along\r\nthe Loire, that the systematic development of vaulted church\r\narchitecture began. Naves covered with barrel-vaults appear in a number\r\nof large churches built during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, with\r\napsidal and transeptal chapels and aisles carried around the apse, as in\r\nSt. Etienne, Nevers, +Notre Dame du Port+ at Clermont-Ferrand (Fig. 96),\r\nand +St. Paul+ at Issoire. The thrust of these ponderous vaults was\r\nclumsily resisted by half-barrel vaults over the side-aisles,\r\ntransmitting the strain to massive side-walls (Fig. 97), or by high\r\nside-aisles with transverse barrel or groined vaults over each bay. In\r\neither case the clearstory was suppressed--a fact which mattered little\r\nin the sunny southern provinces. In the more cloudy North, in Normandy,\r\nPicardy, and the Royal Domain, the nave-vault was raised higher to admit\r\nof clearstory windows, and its section was in some cases made like a\r\npointed arch, to diminish its thrust, as at +Autun+. But these\r\neleventh-century vaults nearly all fell in, and had to be reconstructed\r\non new principles. In this work the Clunisians seem to have led the way,\r\nas at +Cluny+ (1089) and +Vézelay+ (1100). In the latter church, one of\r\nthe finest and most interesting French edifices of the twelfth century,\r\na groined vault replaced the barrel-vault, though the oblong plan of the\r\nvaulting-bays, due to the nave being wider than the pier-arches, led to\r\nsomewhat awkward twisted surfaces in the vaulting. But even here the\r\nvaults had insufficient lateral buttressing, and began to crack and\r\nsettle; so that in the great ante-chapel, built thirty years later, the\r\nside-aisles were made in two stories, the better to resist the thrust,\r\nand the groined vaults themselves were constructed of pointed section.\r\nThese seem to be the earliest pointed groined vaults in France. It was\r\nnot till the second half of that century, however (1150-1200), that the\r\nflying buttress was combined with such vaults, so as to permit of high\r\nclearstories for the better lighting of the nave; and the problem of\r\nsatisfactorily vaulting an oblong space with a groined vault was not\r\nsolved until the following century.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ONE-AISLED CHURCHES.+ In the Franco-Byzantine churches already\r\ndescribed (p. 164) this difficulty of the oblong vaulting-bay did not\r\noccur, owing to the absence of side-aisles and pier-arches. Following\r\nthis conception of church-planning, a number of interesting parish\r\nchurches and a few cathedrals were built in various parts of France in\r\nwhich side-recesses or chapels took the place of side-aisles. The\r\npartitions separating them served as abutments for the groined or\r\nbarrel-vaults of the nave. The cathedrals of +Autun+ (1150) and\r\n+Langres+ (1160), and in the fourteenth century that of Alby, employed\r\nthis arrangement, common in many earlier Provençal churches which have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 98.--A SIX-PART RIBBED VAULT, SHOWING\r\n  TWO COMPARTMENTS WITH THE FILLINGS COMPLETE.\r\n  _a, a_, _Transverse ribs_ (_doubleaux_); _b, b_, _Wall-ribs_\r\n  (_formerets_); _c, c_, _Groin-ribs_ (_diagonaux_).\r\n  (All the ribs are semicircles.)]\r\n\r\n+SIX-PART VAULTING.+ In the Royal Domain great architectural activity\r\ndoes not appear to have begun until the beginning of the Gothic period\r\nin the middle of the twelfth century. But in Normandy, and especially at\r\nCaen and Mont St. Michel, there were produced, between 1046 and 1120,\r\nsome remarkable churches, in which a high clearstory was secured in\r\nconjunction with a vaulted nave, by the use of “six-part” vaulting (Fig.\r\n98). This was an awkward expedient, by which a square vaulting-bay was\r\ndivided into six parts by the groins and by a middle transverse rib,\r\nnecessitating two narrow skew vaults meeting at the centre. This\r\nunsatisfactory device was retained for over a century, and was common in\r\nearly Gothic churches both in France and Great Britain. It made it\r\npossible to resist the thrust by high side-aisles, and yet to open\r\nwindows above these under the cross-vaults. The abbey churches of +St.\r\nEtienne+ (the Abbaye aux Hommes) and +Ste. Trinité+ (Abbaye aux Dames),\r\nat Caen, built in the time of William the Conqueror, were among the most\r\nmagnificent churches of their time, both in size and in the excellence\r\nand ingenuity of their construction. The great abbey church of +Mont St.\r\nMichel+ (much altered in later times) should also be mentioned here. At\r\nthe same time these and other Norman churches showed a great advance in\r\ntheir internal composition. A well-developed triforium or subordinate\r\ngallery was introduced between the pier-arches and clearstory, and all\r\nthe structural membering of the edifice was better proportioned and more\r\nlogically expressed than in most contemporary work.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.+ The details of French Romanesque architecture\r\nvaried considerably in the several provinces, according as classic,\r\nByzantine, or local influences prevailed. Except in a few of the\r\nAquitanian churches, the round arch was universal. The walls were heavy\r\nand built of rubble between facings of stones of moderate size dressed\r\nwith the axe. Windows and doors were widely splayed to diminish the\r\nobstruction of the massive walls, and were treated with jamb-shafts and\r\nrecessed arches. These were usually formed with large cylindrical\r\nmouldings, richly carved with leaf ornaments, zigzags, billets, and\r\ngrotesques. Figure-sculpture was more generally used in the South than\r\nin the North. The interior piers were sometimes cylindrical, but more\r\noften clustered, and where square bays of four-part or six-part vaulting\r\nwere employed, the piers were alternately lighter and heavier. Each\r\nshaft had its independent capital either of the block type or of a form\r\nresembling somewhat that of the Corinthian order. During the eleventh\r\ncentury it became customary to carry up to the main vaulting one or more\r\nshafts of the compound pier to support the vaulting ribs. Thus the\r\ndivision of the nave into _bays_ was accentuated, while at the same time\r\nthe horizontal three-fold division of the height by a well-defined\r\ntriforium between the pier-arches and clearstory began to be likewise\r\nemphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\n+VAULTING.+ The vaulting was also divided into bays by transverse ribs,\r\nand where it was groined the groins themselves began in the twelfth\r\ncentury to be marked by groin-ribs. These were constructed independently\r\nof the vaulting, and the four or six compartments of each vaulting-bay\r\nwere then built in, the ribs serving, in part at least, to support the\r\ncentrings for this purpose. This far-reaching principle, already applied\r\nby the Romans in their concrete vaults (see p. 84), appears as a\r\nre-discovery, or rather an independent invention, of the builders of\r\nNormandy at the close of the eleventh century. The flying buttress was a\r\nlater invention; in the round-arched buildings of the eleventh and\r\ntwelfth centuries the buttressing was mainly internal, and was\r\nincomplete and timid in its arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n+EXTERIORS.+ The exteriors were on this account plain and flat. The\r\nwindows were small, the mouldings simple, and towers were rarely\r\ncombined with the body of the church until after the beginning of the\r\ntwelfth century. Then they appeared as mere belfries of moderate height,\r\nwith pyramidal roofs and effectively arranged openings, the germs of the\r\nnoble Gothic spires of later times. Externally the western porches and\r\nportals were the most important features of the design, producing an\r\nimposing effect by their massive arches, clustered piers, richly carved\r\nmouldings, and deep shadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CLOISTERS, ETC.+ Mention should be made of the other monastic buildings\r\nwhich were grouped around the abbey churches of this period. These\r\ncomprised refectories, chapter-halls, cloistered courts surrounded by\r\nthe conventual cells, and a large number of accessory structures for\r\nkitchens, infirmaries, stores, etc. The whole formed an elaborate and\r\ncomplex aggregation of connected buildings, often of great size and\r\nbeauty, especially the refectories and cloisters. Most of these\r\nconventual buildings have disappeared, many of them having been\r\ndemolished during the Gothic period to make way for more elegant\r\nstructures in the new style. There remain, however, a number of fine\r\ncloistered courts in their original form, especially in Southern France.\r\nAmong the most remarkable of these are those of +Moissac+, +Elne+, and\r\n+Montmajour+.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS.+ ITALY.

The early churches were of wood,\r\nand the substitution of stone for wood proceeded slowly. During the\r\nCarolingian epoch (800-919), however, a few important buildings were\r\nerected, embodying Byzantine and classic traditions. Among these the\r\nmost notable was the +Minster+ or palatine chapel of Charlemagne at\r\n+Aix-la-Chapelle+, an obvious imitation of San Vitale at Ravenna. It\r\nconsisted of an octagonal domed hall surrounded by a vaulted aisle in\r\ntwo stories, but without the eight niches of the Ravenna plan. It was\r\npreceded by a porch flanked by turrets. The Byzantine type thus\r\nintroduced was repeated in later churches, as in the Nuns’ Choir at\r\nEssen (947) and at Ottmarsheim (1050). In the great monastery at Fulda a\r\nbasilica with transepts and with an apsidal choir at either end was\r\nbuilt in 803. These choirs were raised above the level of the nave, to\r\nadmit of crypts beneath them, as in many Lombard churches; a practice\r\nwhich, with the reduplication of the choir and apse just mentioned,\r\nbecame very common in German Romanesque architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n+EARLY CHURCHES.+ It was in Saxony that this architecture first entered\r\nupon a truly national development. The early churches of this province\r\nand of Hildesheim (where architecture flourished under the favor of the\r\nbishops, as elsewhere under the royal influence) were of basilican plan\r\nand destitute of vaulting, except in the crypts. They were built with\r\nmassive piers, sometimes rectangular, sometimes clustered, the two kinds\r\noften alternating in the same nave. Short columns were, however,\r\nsometimes used instead of piers, either alone, as at Paulinzelle and\r\nLimburg-on-the-Hardt (1024-39), or alternating with piers, as at\r\nHecklingen, +Gernrode+ (958-1050), and +St. Godehard+ at Hildesheim\r\n(1133). A triple eastern apse, with apsidal chapels projecting eastward\r\nfrom the transepts, were common elements in the plans, and a second\r\napse, choir, and crypt at the west end were not infrequent. Externally\r\nthe most striking feature was the association of two, four, or even six\r\nsquare or circular towers with the mass of the church, and the elevation\r\nof square or polygonal turrets or cupolas over the crossing. These\r\nadjuncts gave a very picturesque aspect to edifices otherwise somewhat\r\nwanting in artistic interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 99.--PLAN OF MINSTER AT WORMS.]\r\n\r\n+RHENISH CHURCHES.+ It was in the Rhine provinces that vaulting was\r\nfirst applied to the naves of German churches, nearly a half century\r\nafter its general adoption in France. Cologne possesses an interesting\r\ntrio of churches in which the Byzantine dome on squinches or on\r\npendentives, with three apses or niches opening into the central area,\r\nwas associated with a long three aisled nave (+St. Mary-in-the-Capitol+,\r\nbegun in 9th century; +Great St. Martin’s+, 1150-70; +Apostles’ Church+,\r\n1160-99: the naves vaulted later). The double chapel at\r\n+Schwarz-Rheindorf+, near Bonn (1151), also has the crossing covered by\r\na dome on pendentives.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 100.--ONE BAY OF CATHEDRAL AT SPIRES.]\r\n\r\nThe vaulting of the nave itself was developed in another series of\r\nedifices of imposing size, the cathedrals of +Mayence+ (1036), +Spires+\r\n(Speyer), and +Worms+, and the +Abbey of Laach+, all built in the 11th\r\ncentury and vaulted early in the 12th. In the first three the main\r\nvaulting is in square bays, each covering two bays of the nave, the\r\npiers of which are alternately lighter and heavier (Figs. 99, 100). At\r\nLaach the vaulting-bays are oblong, both in nave and aisles. There was\r\nno triforium gallery, and stability was secured only by excessive\r\nthickness in the piers and clearstory walls, and by bringing down the\r\nmain vault as near to the side-aisle roofs as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n+RHENISH EXTERIORS.+ These great churches, together with those of +Bonn+\r\nand +Limburg-on-the-Lahn+ and the cathedral of +Treves+ (Trier, 1047),\r\nare interesting, not only by their size and dignity of plan and the\r\nsomewhat rude massiveness of their construction, but even more so by the\r\npicturesqueness of their external design (Fig. 101). Especially\r\nsuccessful is the massing of the large and small turrets with the lofty\r\nnave-roof and with the apses at one or both ends. The systematic use of\r\narcading to decorate the exterior walls, and the introduction of open\r\narcaded dwarf galleries under the cornices of the apses, gables, and\r\ndome-turrets, gave to these Rhenish churches an external beauty hardly\r\nequalled in other contemporary edifices. This method of exterior design,\r\nand the system of vaulting in square bays over double bays of the nave,\r\nwere probably derived from the Lombard churches of Northern Italy, with\r\nwhich the Hohenstauffen emperors had many political relations.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 101.--EAST END OF CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES,\r\n  COLOGNE.]\r\n\r\nThe Italian influence is also encountered in a number of circular\r\nchurches of early date, as at Fulda (9th-11th century), Drügelte, Bonn\r\n(baptistery, demolished), and in façades like that at Rosheim, which is\r\na copy in little of San Zeno at Verona.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in Germany architecture was in a backward state, especially in\r\nthe southern provinces. Outside of Saxony, Franconia, and the Rhine\r\nprovinces, very few works of importance were erected until the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n+SECULAR ARCHITECTURE.+ Little remains to us of the secular architecture\r\nof this period in Germany, if we except the great feudal castles,\r\nespecially those of the Rhine, which were, after all, rather works of\r\nmilitary engineering than of architectural art. The palace of\r\nCharlemagne at Aix (the chapel of which was mentioned on p. 172) is\r\nknown to have been a vast and splendid group of buildings, partly, at\r\nleast of marble; but hardly a vestige of it remains. Of the extensive\r\n+Palace of Henry III.+ at +Goslar+ there remain well-defined ruins of an\r\nimposing hall of assembly in two aisles with triple-arched windows. At\r\nBrunswick the east wing of the +Burg Dankwargerode+ displays, in spite\r\nof modern alterations, the arrangement of the chapel, great hall, two\r\nfortified towers, and part of the residence of Henry the Lion. The\r\n+Wartburg+ palace (Ludwig III., _cir._ 1150) is more generally\r\nknown--a rectangular hall in three stories, with windows effectively\r\ngrouped to form arcades; while at Gelnhausen and Münzenberg are ruins of\r\nsomewhat similar buildings. A few of the Romanesque monasteries of\r\nGermany have left partial remains, as at +Maulbronn+, which was almost\r\nentirely rebuilt in the Gothic period, and isolated buildings in Cologne\r\nand elsewhere. There remain also in Cologne a number of Romanesque\r\nprivate houses with coupled windows and stepped gables.\r\n\r\n\r\n+GREAT BRITAIN.+ Previous to the Norman conquest (1066) there was in the\r\nBritish Isles little or no architecture worthy of mention. The few\r\nextant remains of Saxon and Celtic buildings reveal a singular poverty\r\nof ideas and want of technical skill. These scanty remains are mostly of\r\ntowers (those in Ireland nearly all round and tapering, with conical\r\ntops, their use and date being the subjects of much controversy) and\r\ncrypts. The tower of Earl’s Barton is the most important and best\r\npreserved of those in England. With the Norman conquest, however, began\r\nan extraordinary activity in the building of churches and abbeys.\r\nWilliam the Conqueror himself founded a number of these, and his Norman\r\necclesiastics endeavored to surpass on British soil the contemporary\r\nchurches of Normandy. The new churches differed somewhat from their\r\nFrench prototypes; they were narrower and lower, but much longer,\r\nespecially as to the choir and transepts. The cathedrals of +Durham+\r\n(1096-1133) and +Norwich+ (same date) are important examples (Fig. 102).\r\nThey also differed from the French churches in two important particulars\r\nexternally; a huge tower rose usually over the crossing, and the western\r\nportals were small and insignificant. Lateral entrances near the west\r\nend were given greater importance and called _Galilees_. At Durham a\r\nGalilee chapel (not shown in the plan), takes the place of a porch at\r\nthe west end, like the ante-churches of St. Benoît-sur-Loire and\r\nVézelay.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 102.--PLAN OF DURHAM CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE NORMAN STYLE.+ The Anglo-Norman builders employed the same general\r\nfeatures as the Romanesque builders of Normandy, but with more of\r\npicturesqueness and less of refinement and technical elegance. Heavy\r\nwalls, recessed arches, round mouldings, cubic cushion-caps, clustered\r\npiers, and in doorways a jamb-shaft for each stepping of the arch were\r\ncommon to both styles. But in England the Corinthian form of capital is\r\nrare, its place being taken by simpler forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n+NORMAN INTERIORS.+ The interior design of the larger churches of this\r\nperiod shows a close general analogy to contemporaneous French Norman\r\nchurches, as appears by comparing the nave of Waltham or Peterboro’ with\r\nthat of Cérisy-la-Forêt, in Normandy. Although the massiveness of the\r\nAnglo-Norman piers and walls plainly suggests the intention of vaulting\r\nthe nave, this intention seems never to have been carried out except in\r\nsmall churches and crypts. All the existing abbeys and cathedrals of\r\nthis period had wooden ceilings or were, like Durham, Norwich, and\r\nGloucester, vaulted at a later date. Completed as they were with wooden\r\nnave-roofs, the clearstory was, without danger, made quite lofty and\r\nfurnished with windows of considerable size. These were placed near the\r\noutside of the thick wall, and a passage was left between them and\r\na triple arch on the inner face of the wall--a device imitated\r\nfrom the abbeys at Caen. The vaulted side-aisles were low, with\r\ndisproportionately wide pier-arches, above which was a high triforium\r\ngallery under the side-roofs. Thus a nearly equal height was assigned\r\nto each of the three stories of the bay, disregarding that subordination\r\nof minor to major parts which gives interest to an architectural\r\ncomposition. The piers were quite often round, as at Gloucester,\r\nHereford, and Bristol. Sometimes round piers alternated with clustered\r\npiers, as at Durham and Waltham; and in some cases clustered piers alone\r\nwere employed, as at Peterboro’ and in the transepts of Winchester (Fig.\r\n103).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 103.--ONE BAY OF TRANSEPT,\r\n  WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+FAÇADES AND DOORWAYS.+ All the details were of the simplest character,\r\nexcept in the doorways. These were richly adorned with clustered\r\njamb-shafts and elaborately carved mouldings, but there was little\r\nvariety in the details of this carving. The zigzag was the most common\r\nfeature, though birds’ heads with the beaks pointing toward the centre\r\nof the arch were not uncommon. In the smaller churches (Fig. 104) the\r\ndoorways were better proportioned to the whole façade than in the larger\r\nones, in which they appear as relatively insignificant features. Very\r\nfew examples remain of important Norman façades in their original form,\r\nnearly all of these having been altered after the round arch was\r\ndisplaced by the pointed arch in the latter part of the twelfth century.\r\nIffley church (Fig. 104) is a good example of the style.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 104.--FRONT OF IFFLEY CHURCH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+SPAIN.+ During the Romanesque period a large part of Spain was under\r\nMoorish dominion. The capture of Toledo, in 1062, by the Christians,\r\nbegan the gradual emancipation of the country from Moslem rule, and in\r\nthe northern provinces a number of important churches were erected under\r\nthe influence of French Romanesque models. The use of domical\r\npendentives (as in the +Panteon+ of +S. Isidoro+, at Leon, and in the\r\n_cimborio_ or dome over the choir at the intersection of nave and\r\ntransepts in old Salamanca cathedral) was probably derived from the\r\ndomical churches of Aquitania and Anjou. Elsewhere the northern\r\nRomanesque type prevailed under various modifications, with long nave\r\nand transepts, a short choir, and a complete _chevet_ with apsidal\r\nchapels. The church of +St. Iago+ at Compostella (1078) is the finest\r\nexample of this class. These churches nearly all had groined vaulting\r\nover the side-aisles and barrel-vaults over the nave, the constructive\r\nsystem being substantially that of the churches of Auvergne and the\r\nLoire Valley (p. 165). They differed, however, in the treatment of the\r\ncrossing of nave and transepts, over which was usually erected a dome or\r\ncupola or pendentives or squinches, covered externally by an imposing\r\nsquare lantern or tower, as in the +Old Cathedral+ at +Salamanca+,\r\nalready mentioned (1120-78) and the +Collegiate Church+ at +Toro+.\r\nOccasional exceptions to these types are met with, as in the basilican\r\nwooden-roofed church of S. Millan at Segovia; in +S. Isidoro+ at Leon,\r\nwith chapels and a later-added square eastern end, and the circular\r\nchurch of the Templars at Segovia.\r\n\r\nThe architectural details of these Spanish churches did not differ\r\nradically from contemporary French work. As in France and England, the\r\ndoorways were the most ornate parts of the design, the mouldings being\r\ncarved with extreme richness and the jambs frequently adorned with\r\nstatues, as in +S. Vincente+ at Avila. There was no such logical and\r\nreasoned-out system of external design as in France, and there is\r\nconsequently greater variety in the façades. Perhaps the most remarkable\r\nthing about the architecture of this period is its apparent exemption\r\nfrom the influence of the Moorish monuments which abounded on every\r\nhand. This may be explained by the hatred which was felt by the\r\nChristians for the Moslems and all their works.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS.+ GERMANY: Previous to 11th century: Circular churches\r\n  of Holy Cross at Münster, and of Fulda; palace chapel of\r\n  Charlemagne at Aix-la-Chapelle, 804; St. Stephen, Mayence, 990;\r\n  primitive nave and crypt of St. Gereon, Cologne, 10th century;\r\n  Lorsch.--11th century: Churches of Gernrode, Goslar, and Merseburg\r\n  in Saxony; cathedral of Bremen; first restoration of cathedral of\r\n  Treves (Trier), 1010, west front, 1047; Limburg-on-Hardt, 1024;\r\n  St. Willibrod, Echternach, 1031; east end of Mayence Cathedral,\r\n  1036; Church of Apostles and nave St. Mary-in-Capitol at Cologne,\r\n  1036; cathedral of Spires (Speyer) begun 1040; Cathedral\r\n  Hildesheim, 1061; St. Joseph, Bamberg, 1073; Abbey of Laach,\r\n  1093-1156; round churches of Bonn, Drügelte, Nimeguen; cathedrals\r\n  of Paderborn and Minden.--12th century: Churches of Klus,\r\n  Paulinzelle, Hamersleben, 1100-1110; Johannisberg, 1130; St.\r\n  Godehard.

This name has, however, become so fixed in common usage that it\r\nis hardly possible to substitute for it any more scientific designation.\r\nIn reality the architecture to which it is applied was nothing more than\r\nthe sequel and outgrowth of the Romanesque, which we have already\r\nstudied. Its fundamental principles were the same; it was concerned with\r\nthe same problems. These it took up where the Romanesque builders left\r\nthem, and worked out their solution under new conditions, until it had\r\ndeveloped out of the simple and massive models of the early twelfth\r\ncentury the splendid cathedrals of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies in England, France, Germany, the Low Countries and Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE CHURCH AND ARCHITECTURE.+ The twelfth century was an era of\r\ntransition in society, as in architecture. The ideas of Church and State\r\nwere becoming more clearly defined in the common mind. In the conflict\r\nbetween feudalism and royalty the monarchy was steadily gaining ground.\r\nThe problem of human right was beginning to present itself alongside of\r\nthe problem of human might. The relations between the crown, the feudal\r\nbarons, the pope, bishops, and abbots, differed widely in France,\r\nGermany, England, and other countries. The struggle among them for\r\nsupremacy presented itself, therefore, in varied aspects; but the\r\ngeneral outcome was essentially the same. The church began to appear as\r\nsomething behind and above abbots, bishops, kings, and barons. The\r\nsupremacy of the papal authority gained increasing recognition, and the\r\nepiscopacy began to overshadow the monastic institutions; the bishops\r\nappearing generally, but especially in France, as the champions of\r\npopular rights. The prerogatives of the crown became more firmly\r\nestablished, and thus the Church and the State emerged from the social\r\nconfusion as the two institutions divinely appointed for the government\r\nof men.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 105.--CONSTRUCTIVE SYSTEM OF GOTHIC CHURCH,\r\n  ILLUSTRATING PRINCIPLES OF ISOLATED SUPPORTS AND BUTTRESSING.]\r\n\r\nUnder these influences ecclesiastical architecture advanced with rapid\r\nstrides. No longer hampered by monastic restrictions, it called into its\r\nservice the laity, whose guilds of masons and builders carried from one\r\ndiocese to another their constantly increasing stores of constructive\r\nknowledge. By a wise division of labor, each man wrought only such parts\r\nas he was specially trained to undertake. The master-builder--bishop,\r\nabbot, or mason--seems to have planned only the general arrangement and\r\nscheme of the building, leaving the precise form of each detail to be\r\ndetermined as the work advanced, according to the skill and fancy of the\r\nartisan to whom it was intrusted. Thus was produced that remarkable\r\nvariety in unity of the Gothic cathedrals; thus, also, those singular\r\nirregularities and makeshifts, those discrepancies and alterations in\r\nthe design, which are found in every great work of mediæval\r\narchitecture. Gothic architecture was constantly changing, attacking new\r\nproblems or devising new solutions of old ones. In this character of\r\nconstant flux and development it contrasts strongly with the classic\r\nstyles, in which the scheme and the principles were easily fixed and\r\nremained substantially unchanged for centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 106.--PLAN OF SAINTE CHAPELLE, PARIS,\r\n  SHOWING SUPPRESSION OF SIDE-WALLS.]\r\n\r\n+STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES.+ The pointed arch, so commonly regarded as the\r\nmost characteristic feature of the Gothic styles, was merely an\r\nincidental feature of their development. What really distinguished them\r\nmost strikingly was the systematic application of two principles which\r\nthe Roman and Byzantine builders had recognized and applied, but which\r\nseem to have been afterward forgotten until they were revived by the\r\nlater Romanesque architects. The first of these was the _concentration\r\nof strains_ upon isolated points of support, made possible by the\r\nsubstitution of groined for barrel vaults. This led to a corresponding\r\nconcentration of the masses of masonry at these points; the building was\r\nconstructed as if upon legs (Fig. 105). The wall became a mere\r\nfilling-in between the piers or buttresses, and in time was, indeed,\r\npractically suppressed, immense windows filled with stained glass taking\r\nits place. This is well illustrated in the +Sainte Chapelle+ at Paris,\r\nbuilt 1242-47 (Figs. 106, 122). In this remarkable edifice, a series of\r\ngroined vaults spring from slender shafts built against deep buttresses\r\nwhich receive and resist all the thrusts. The wall-spaces between them\r\nare wholly occupied by superb windows filled with stone tracery and\r\nstained glass. It would be impossible to combine the materials used more\r\nscientifically or effectively. The cathedrals of Gerona (Spain) and of\r\nAlby (France; Fig. 123) illustrate the same principle, though in them\r\nthe buttresses are internal and serve to separate the flanking chapels.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 107.--EARLY GOTHIC FLYING BUTTRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe second distinctive principle of Gothic architecture was that of\r\n_balanced thrusts_. In Roman buildings the thrust of the vaulting was\r\nresisted wholly by the inertia of mass in the abutments. In Gothic\r\narchitecture thrusts were as far as possible resisted by\r\ncounter-thrusts, and the final resultant pressure was transmitted by\r\nflying half-arches across the intervening portions of the structure to\r\nexternal buttresses placed at convenient points. This combination of\r\nflying half-arches and buttresses is called the _flying-buttress_ (Fig.\r\n107). It reached its highest development in the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries in the cathedrals of central and northern France.\r\n\r\n\r\n+RIBBED VAULTING.+ These two principles formed the structural basis of\r\nthe Gothic styles. Their application led to the introduction of two\r\nother elements, second only to them in importance, _ribbed vaulting_ and\r\nthe _pointed arch_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 108.--RIBBED VAULT, ENGLISH TYPE,\r\n  WITH DIVIDED GROIN-RIBS AND RIDGE-RIBS.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these resulted from the effort to overcome certain\r\npractical difficulties encountered in the building of large groined\r\nvaults. As ordinarily constructed, a groined vault like that in Fig. 47,\r\nmust be built as one structure, upon wooden centrings supporting its\r\nwhole extent. The Romanesque architects conceived the idea of\r\nconstructing an independent skeleton of ribs. Two of these were built\r\nagainst the wall (_wall-ribs_), two across the nave (transverse ribs);\r\nand two others were made to coincide with the groins (Figs. 98, 108).\r\nThe _groin-ribs_, intersecting at the centre of the vault, divided each\r\nbay into four triangular portions, or _compartments_, each of which was\r\nreally an independent vault which could be separately constructed upon\r\nlight centrings supported by the groin-ribs themselves. This principle,\r\nthough identical in essence with the Roman system of brick skeleton-ribs\r\nfor concrete vaults, was, in application and detail, superior to it,\r\nboth from the scientific and artistic point of view. The ribs, richly\r\nmoulded, became, in the hands of the Gothic architects, important\r\ndecorative features. In practice the builder gave to each set of ribs\r\nindependently the curvature he desired. The vaulting-surfaces were then\r\neasily twisted or warped so as to fit the various ribs, which, being\r\nalready in place, served as guides for their construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 109.--PENETRATIONS AND INTERSECTIONS\r\n  OF VAULTS.\r\n  _a, a_, _Penetrations by small semi-circular vaults sprung from\r\n  same level_. b, _Intersection by small semi-circular vault sprung\r\n  from higher level; groins form wavy lines_. c, _Intersection by\r\n  narrow pointed vault sprung from same level; groins are plane\r\n  curves_.]\r\n\r\n+THE POINTED ARCH+ was adopted to remedy the difficulties encountered in\r\nthe construction of oblong vaults. It is obvious that where a narrow\r\nsemi-cylindrical vault intersects a wide one, it produces either what\r\nare called _penetrations_, as at a (Fig. 109), or intersections like\r\nthat at b, both of which are awkward in aspect and hard to construct.\r\nIf, however, one or both vaults be given a pointed section, the narrow\r\nvault may be made as high as the wide one. It is then possible, with but\r\nlittle warping of the vaulting surfaces, to make them intersect in\r\ngroins c, which are vertical plane curves instead of wavy loops like a\r\nand b.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic architects availed themselves to the full of these two\r\ndevices. They built their groin-ribs of semi-circular or pointed form,\r\nbut the wall-ribs and the transverse ribs were, without exception,\r\npointed arches of such curvature as would bring the apex of each nearly\r\nor quite to the level of the groin intersection. The pointed arch, thus\r\nintroduced as the most convenient form for the vaulting-ribs, was soon\r\napplied to other parts of the structure. This was a necessity with the\r\nwindows and pier-arches, which would not otherwise fit well the\r\nwall-spaces under the wall-ribs of the nave and aisle vaulting.\r\n\r\n\r\n+TRACERY AND GLASS.+ With the growth in the size of the windows and the\r\nprogressive suppression of the lateral walls of vaulted structures,\r\nstained glass came more and more generally into use. Its introduction\r\nnot only resulted in a notable heightening and enriching of the colors\r\nand scheme of the interior decoration, but reacted on the architecture,\r\nintensifying the very causes which led to its introduction. It\r\nstimulated the increase in the size of windows, and the suppression of\r\nthe walls, and contributed greatly to the development of _tracery_. This\r\nlatter feature was an absolute necessity for the support of the glass.\r\nIts evolution can be traced (Figs, 110, 111, 112) from the simple\r\ncoupling of twin windows under a single hood-mould, or discharging arch,\r\nto the florid net-work of the fifteenth century. In its earlier forms it\r\nconsisted merely of decorative openings, circles, and quatrefoils,\r\npierced through slabs of stone (_plate-tracery_), filling the\r\nwindow-heads over coupled windows. Later attention was bestowed upon the\r\nform of the stonework, which was made lighter and richly moulded\r\n(_bar-tracery_), rather than upon that of the openings (Fig. 111). Then\r\nthe circular and geometric patterns employed were abandoned for more\r\nflowing and capricious designs (_Flamboyant_ tracery, Fig. 112) or (in\r\nEngland) for more rigid and rectangular arrangements (_Perpendicular_,\r\nFig. 134). It will be shown later that the periods and styles of Gothic\r\narchitecture are more easily identified by the tracery than by any other\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 110.--PLATE TRACERY, CHARLTON-ON-OXMORE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHURCH PLANS.+ The original basilica-plan underwent radical\r\nmodifications during the 12th-15th centuries. These resulted in part\r\nfrom the changes in construction which have been described, and in part\r\nfrom altered ecclesiastical conditions and requirements. Gothic church\r\narchitecture was based on cathedral design; and the requirements of the\r\ncathedral differed in many respects from those of the monastic churches\r\nof the preceding period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 111--BAR TRACERY, ST. MICHAEL’S, WARFIELD.]\r\n\r\nThe most important alterations in the plan were in the choir and\r\ntransepts. The choir was greatly lengthened, the transepts often\r\nshortened. The choir was provided with two and often four side-aisles,\r\nand one or both of these was commonly carried entirely around the\r\napsidal termination of the choir, forming a single or double\r\n_ambulatory_. This combination of choir, apse, and ambulatory was\r\ncalled, in French churches, the _chevet_.\r\n\r\nAnother advance upon Romanesque models was the multiplication of\r\nchapels--a natural consequence of the more popular character of the\r\ncathedral as compared with the abbey. Frequently lateral chapels were\r\nbuilt at each bay of the side-aisles, filling up the space between the\r\ndeep buttresses, flanking the nave as well as the choir. They were also\r\ncarried around the _chevet_ in most of the French cathedrals (Paris,\r\nBourges, Reims, Amiens, Beauvais, and many others); in many of those in\r\nGermany (Magdeburg, Cologne, Frauenkirche at Treves), Spain (Toledo,\r\nLeon, Barcelona, Segovia, etc.), and Belgium (Tournay, Antwerp). In\r\nEngland the choir had more commonly a square eastward termination.\r\nSecondary transepts occur frequently, and these peculiarities, together\r\nwith the narrowness and great length of most of the plans, make of the\r\nEnglish cathedrals a class by themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 112.--ROSE WINDOW, CHURCH OF ST. OUEN, ROUEN.]\r\n\r\n+PROPORTIONS AND COMPOSITION.+ Along with these modifications of the\r\nbasilican plan should be noticed a great increase in the height and\r\nslenderness of all parts of the structure. The lofty clearstory, the\r\narcaded triforium-passage or gallery beneath it, the high pointed\r\npier-arches, the multiplication of slender clustered shafts, and the\r\nreduction in the area of the piers, gave to the Gothic churches an\r\ninterior aspect wholly different from that of the simpler, lower, and\r\nmore massive Romanesque edifices. The perspective effects of the plans\r\nthus modified, especially of the complex choir and _chevet_ with their\r\nlateral and radial chapels, were remarkably enriched and varied.\r\n\r\nThe exterior was even more radically transformed by these changes, and\r\nby the addition of towers and spires to the fronts, and sometimes to the\r\ntransepts and to their intersection with the nave. The deep buttresses,\r\nterminating in pinnacles, the rich traceries of the great lateral\r\nwindows, the triple portals profusely sculptured, rose-windows of great\r\nsize under the front and transept gables, combined to produce effects of\r\nmarvellously varied light and shadow, and of complex and elaborate\r\nstructural beauty, totally unlike the broad simplicity of the Romanesque\r\nexteriors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 113.--FLAMBOYANT DETAIL FROM PULPIT\r\n  IN STRASBURG CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 114.--EARLY GOTHIC CARVING.]\r\n\r\n+DECORATIVE DETAIL.+ The mediæval designers aimed to enrich every\r\nconstructive feature with the most effective play of lights and shades,\r\nand to embody in the decorative detail the greatest possible amount of\r\nallegory and symbolism, and sometimes of humor besides. The deep jambs\r\nand soffits of doors and pier-arches were moulded with a rich succession\r\nof hollow and convex members, and adorned with carvings of saints,\r\napostles, martyrs, and angels. Virtues and vices, allegories of reward\r\nand punishment, and an extraordinary world of monstrous and grotesque\r\nbeasts, devils, and goblins filled the capitals and door-arches, peeped\r\nover tower-parapets, or leered and grinned from gargoyles and corbels.\r\nAnother source of decorative detail was the application of tracery like\r\nthat of the windows to wall-panelling, to balustrades, to open-work\r\ngables, to spires, to choir-screens, and other features, especially in\r\nthe late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries (cathedrals of York, Rouen,\r\nCologne; Henry VII.’s Chapel, Westminster). And finally in the carving\r\nof capitals and the ornamentation of mouldings the artists of the\r\nthirteenth century and their successors abandoned completely the classic\r\nmodels and traditions which still survived in the early twelfth century.\r\nThe later monastic builders began to look directly to nature for\r\nsuggestions of decorative form. The lay builders who sculptured the\r\ncapitals and crockets and finials of the early Gothic cathedrals adopted\r\nand followed to its finality this principle of recourse to nature,\r\nespecially to plant life. At first the budding shoots of early spring\r\nwere freely imitated or skilfully conventionalized, as being by their\r\nthick and vigorous forms the best adapted for translation into stone\r\n(Fig. 114). During the thirteenth century the more advanced stages of\r\nplant growth, and leaves more complex and detailed, furnished the models\r\nfor the carver, who displayed his skill in a closer and more literal\r\nimitation of their minute veinings and indentations (Fig. 115). This\r\nartistic adaptation of natural forms to architectural decoration\r\ndegenerated later into a minutely realistic copying of natural foliage,\r\nin which cleverness of execution took the place of original invention.\r\nThe spirit of display is characteristic of all late Gothic work.\r\nSlenderness, minuteness of detail, extreme complexity and intricacy of\r\ndesign, an unrestrained profusion of decoration covering every surface,\r\na lack of largeness and vigor in the conceptions, are conspicuous traits\r\nof Gothic design in the fifteenth century, alike in France, England,\r\nGermany, Spain, and the Low Countries. Having worked out to their\r\nconclusion the structural principles bequeathed to them by the preceding\r\ncenturies, the authors of these later works seemed to have devoted\r\nthemselves to the elaboration of mere decorative detail, and in\r\ntechnical finish surpassed all that had gone before (Fig. 113).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 115.--CARVING, DECORATED PERIOD,\r\n  FROM SOUTHWELL MINSTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHARACTERISTICS SUMMARIZED.+ In the light of the preceding explanations\r\nGothic architecture may be defined as that system of structural design\r\nand decoration which grew up out of the effort to combine, in one\r\nharmonious and organic conception, the basilican plan with a complete\r\nand systematic construction of groined vaulting. Its development was\r\ncontrolled throughout by considerations of stability and structural\r\npropriety, but in the application of these considerations the artistic\r\nspirit was allowed full scope for its exercise. Refinement, good taste,\r\nand great fertility of imagination characterize the details and\r\nornaments of Gothic structures. While the Greeks in harmonizing the\r\nrequirements of utility and beauty in architecture approached the\r\nproblem from the æsthetic side, the Gothic architects did the same from\r\nthe structural side. Their admirably reasoned structures express as\r\nperfectly the idea of vastness, mystery, and complexity as do the Greek\r\ntemples that of simplicity and monumental repose.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of Gothic architecture lay not so much in its individual\r\ndetails as in its perfect adaptation to the purposes for which it was\r\ndeveloped--its triumphs were achieved in the building of cathedrals and\r\nlarge churches. In the domain of civil and domestic architecture it\r\nproduced nothing comparable with its ecclesiastical edifices, because it\r\nwas the requirements of the cathedral and not of the palace, town-hall,\r\nor dwelling, that gave it its form and character.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PERIODS.+ The history of Gothic architecture is commonly divided into\r\nthree periods, which are most readily distinguished by the character of\r\nthe window-tracery. These periods were not by any means synchronous in\r\nthe different countries; but the order of sequence was everywhere the\r\nsame. They are here given, with a summary of the characteristics of\r\neach.\r\n\r\nEARLY POINTED PERIOD. [_Early French_; _Early English_ or _Lancet_\r\nPeriod in England; _Early German_, etc.] Simple groined vaults; general\r\nsimplicity and vigor of design and detail; conventionalized foliage of\r\nsmall plants; plate tracery, and narrow windows coupled under pointed\r\narch with circular foiled openings in the window-head. (In France, 1160\r\nto 1275.)\r\n\r\nMIDDLE POINTED PERIOD. [_Rayonnant_ in France; _Decorated_ or\r\n_Geometric_ in England.] Vaults more perfect; in England multiple ribs\r\nand liernes; greater slenderness and loftiness of proportions;\r\ndecoration much richer, less vigorous; more naturalistic carving of\r\nmature foliage; walls nearly suppressed, windows of great size, bar\r\ntracery with slender moulded or columnar mullions and geometric\r\ncombinations (circles and cusps) in window-heads, circular (rose)\r\nwindows. (In France, 1275 to 1375.)\r\n\r\nFLORID GOTHIC PERIOD. [_Flamboyant_ in France; _Perpendicular_ in\r\nEngland.] Vaults of varied and richly decorated design; fan-vaulting and\r\npendants in England, vault-ribs curved into fanciful patterns in Germany\r\nand Spain; profuse and minute decoration and cleverness of technical\r\nexecution substituted for dignity of design; highly realistic carving\r\nand sculpture, flowing or flamboyant tracery in France; perpendicular\r\nbars with horizontal transoms and four-centred arches in England;\r\n“branch-tracery” in Germany.

They surpassed all their contemporaries in readiness of invention,\r\nin quickness and directness of reasoning, and in artistic refinement.\r\nThese qualities were especially manifested in the extraordinary\r\narchitectural activity which marked the second half of the twelfth\r\ncentury and the first half of the thirteenth. This was the great age of\r\ncathedral-building in France. The adhesion of the bishops to the royal\r\ncause, and their position in popular estimation as the champions of\r\njustice and human rights, led to the rapid advance of the episcopacy in\r\npower and influence. The cathedral, as the throne-church of the bishop,\r\nbecame a truly popular institution. New cathedrals were founded on every\r\nside, especially in the Royal Domain and the adjoining provinces of\r\nNormandy, Burgundy, and Champagne, and their construction was warmly\r\nseconded by the people, the communes, and the municipalities. “Nothing\r\nto-day,” says Viollet-le-Duc,[21] “unless it be the commercial movement\r\nwhich has covered Europe with railway lines, can give an idea of the\r\nzeal with which the urban populations set about building cathedrals; ...\r\na necessity at the end of the twelfth century because it was an\r\nenergetic protest against feudalism.” The collapse of the unscientific\r\nRomanesque vaulting of some of the earlier cathedrals and the\r\ndestruction by fire of others stimulated this movement by the necessity\r\nfor their immediate rebuilding. The entire reconstruction of the\r\ncathedrals of Bayeux, Bayonne, Cambray, Evreux, Laon, Lisieux, Le Mans,\r\nNoyon, Poitiers, Senlis, Soissons, and Troyes was begun between 1130 and\r\n1200.[22] The cathedrals of Bourges, Chartres, Paris, and Tours, and the\r\nabbey of St. Denis, all of the first importance, were begun during the\r\nsame period, and during the next quarter-century those of Amiens,\r\nAuxerre, Rouen, Reims, Séez, and many others. After 1250 the movement\r\nslackened and finally ceased. Few important cathedrals were erected\r\nduring the latter half of the thirteenth century, the chief among them\r\nbeing at Beauvais (actively begun 1247), Clermont, Coutances, Limoges,\r\nNarbonne, and Rodez. During this period, and through the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, French architecture was concerned rather with the\r\ncompletion and remodelling of existing cathedrals than the founding of\r\nnew ones. There were, however, many important parish churches and civil\r\nor domestic edifices erected within this period.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: _Dictionnaire raisonné de l’architecture française_,\r\n    vol. ii., pp. 280, 281.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: See Ferree, _Chronology of Cathedral Churches of\r\n    France_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT: VAULTING.+ By the middle of the twelfth century\r\nthe use of barrel-vaulting over the nave had been generally abandoned\r\nand groined vaulting with its isolated points of support and resistance\r\nhad taken its place. The timid experiments of the Clunisian architects\r\nat Vézelay in the use of the pointed arch and vault-ribs also led, in\r\nthe second half of the twelfth century, to far-reaching results. The\r\nbuilders of the great +Abbey Church+ of +St. Denis+, near Paris, begun\r\nin 1140 by the Abbot Suger, appear to have been the first to develop\r\nthese tentative devices into a system. In the original choir of this\r\nnoble church all the arches, alike of the vault-ribs (except the\r\ngroin-ribs, which were semi-circles) and of the openings, were pointed\r\nand the vaults were throughout constructed with cross-ribs, wall-ribs,\r\nand groin-ribs. Of this early work only the chapels remain. In other\r\ncontemporary monuments, as for instance in the cathedral of Sens, the\r\nadoption of these devices was only partial and hesitating.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 116--PLAN OF NOTRE DAME, PARIS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 117.--INTERIOR OF NOTRE DAME, PARIS.]\r\n\r\n+NOTRE DAME AT PARIS.+ The next great step in advance was taken in the\r\ncathedral of +Notre Dame+[23] at Paris (Figs. 116, 117, 125). This was\r\nbegun, under Maurice de Sully in 1163, on the site of the twin\r\ncathedrals of Ste. Marie and St. Étienne, and the choir was, as usual,\r\nthe first portion erected. By 1196 the choir, transepts, and one or two\r\nbays of the nave were substantially finished. The completeness, harmony,\r\nand vigor of conception of this remarkable church contrast strikingly\r\nwith the makeshifts and hesitancy displayed in many contemporary\r\nmonuments in other provinces. The difficult vaulting over the radiating\r\nbays of the double ambulatory was here treated with great elegance. By\r\ndoubling the number of supports in the exterior circuit of each aisle\r\n(Fig. 116) each trapezoidal bay of the vaulting was divided into three\r\neasily managed triangular compartments. Circular shafts were used\r\nbetween the central and side aisles. The side aisles were doubled and\r\nthose next the centre were built in two stories, providing ample\r\ngalleries behind a very open triforium. The nave was unusually lofty and\r\ncovered with six-part vaults of admirable execution. The vault-ribs were\r\nvigorously moulded and each made to spring from a distinct\r\nvaulting-shaft, of which three rested upon the cap of each of the\r\nmassive piers below (Fig. 117). The +Cathedral+ of +Bourges+, begun\r\n1190, closely resembled that of Paris in plan. Both were designed to\r\naccommodate vast throngs in their exceptionally broad central aisles and\r\ndouble side aisles, but Bourges has no side-aisle galleries, though the\r\ninner aisles are much loftier than the outer ones. Though later in date\r\nthe vaulting of Bourges is inferior to that of Notre Dame, especially in\r\nthe treatment of the trapezoidal bays of the ambulatory.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: This cathedral will be hereafter referred to, for\r\n    the sake of brevity, by the name of _Notre Dame_. Other cathedrals\r\n    having the same name will be distinguished by the addition of the\r\n    name of the city, as “Notre Dame at Clermont-Ferrand.”]\r\n\r\nThe masterly examples set by the vault-builders of St. Denis and Notre\r\nDame were not at once generally followed. Noyon, Senlis, and Soissons,\r\ncontemporary with these, are far less completely Gothic in style. At +Le\r\nMans+ the groined vaulting which in 1158 was substituted for the\r\noriginal barrel-vault of the cathedral is of very primitive design,\r\nsingularly heavy and awkward, although nearly contemporary with that of\r\nNotre Dame (Fig. 118).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 118.--LE MANS CATHEDRAL. NAVE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+DOMICAL GROINED VAULTING.+ The builders of the South and West,\r\ninfluenced by Aquitanian models, adhered to the square plan and domical\r\nform of vaulting-bay, even after they had begun to employ groin-ribs.\r\nThe latter, as at first used by them in imitation of Northern examples,\r\nhad no organic function in the vault, which was still built like a dome.\r\nAbout 1145-1160 the cathedral of +St. Maurice+ at +Angers+ was vaulted\r\nwith square, groin-ribbed vaults, domical in form but not in\r\nconstruction. The joints no longer described horizontal circles as in a\r\ndome, but oblique lines perpendicular to the groins and meeting in\r\nzigzag lines at the ridge (Fig. 119). This method became common in the\r\nWest and was afterward generally adopted by the English architects. The\r\n+Cathedrals+ of +Poitiers+ (1162) and +Laval+ (La Trinité, 1180-1185)\r\nare examples of this system, which at Le Mans met with the Northern\r\nsystem and produced in the cathedral the awkward compromise described\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 119.--GROINED VAULT WITH ZIG-ZAG RIDGE-JOINTS.\r\n  _a_ shows a small section of filling with courses parallel to\r\n  the ridge, for comparison with the other compartments.]\r\n\r\n+THIRTEENTH-CENTURY VAULTING.+ Early in the thirteenth century the\r\nchurch-builders of Northern France abandoned the use of square\r\nvaulting-bays and six-part vaults. By the adoption of groin-ribs and the\r\npointed arch, the building of vaults in oblong bays was greatly\r\nsimplified. Each bay of the nave could now be covered with its own\r\nvaulting-bay, thus doing away with all necessity for alternately light\r\nand heavy piers. It is not quite certain when and where this system was\r\nfirst adopted for the complete vaulting of a church. It is, however,\r\nprobable that the +Cathedral+ of +Chartres+, begun in 1194 and completed\r\nbefore 1240, deserves this distinction, although it is possible that the\r\nvaults of Soissons and Noyon may slightly antedate it. +Troyes+\r\n(1170-1267), +Rouen+ (1202-1220), +Reims+ (1212-1242), +Auxerre+\r\n(1215-1234, nave fourteenth century), +Amiens+ (1220-1288), and nearly\r\nall the great churches and chapels begun after 1200, employ the fully\r\ndeveloped oblong vault.\r\n\r\n\r\n+BUTTRESSING.+ Meanwhile the increasing height of the clearstories and\r\nthe use of double aisles compelled the bestowal of especial attention\r\nupon the buttressing. The nave and choir of Chartres, the choirs of\r\nNotre Dame, Bourges, Rouen, and Reims, the chevet and later the choir of\r\nSt. Denis, afford early examples of the flying-buttress (Fig. 107).\r\nThese were at first simple and of moderate height. Single half-arches\r\nspanned the side aisles; in Notre Dame they crossed the double aisles in\r\na single leap. Later the buttresses were given greater stability by the\r\nadded weight of lofty pinnacles. An intermediate range of buttresses and\r\npinnacles was built over the intermediate piers where double aisles\r\nflanked the nave and choir, thus dividing the single flying arch into\r\ntwo arches. At the same time a careful observation of statical defects\r\nin the earlier examples led to the introduction of subordinate arches\r\nand of other devices to stiffen and to beautify the whole system. At\r\n+Reims+ and +Amiens+ these features received their highest development,\r\nthough later examples are frequently much more ornate.\r\n\r\n\r\n+INTERIOR DESIGN.+ The progressive change outlined in the last chapter,\r\nby which the wall was practically suppressed, the windows\r\ncorrespondingly enlarged, and every part of the structure made loftier\r\nand more slender, resulted in the evolution of a system of interior\r\ndesign well represented by the nave of Amiens. The second story or\r\ngallery over the side aisle disappeared, but the aisle itself was very\r\nhigh. The triforium was no longer a gallery, but a richly arcaded\r\npassage in the thickness of the wall, corresponding to the roofing-space\r\nover the aisle, and generally treated like a lower stage of the\r\nclearstory. Nearly the whole space above it was occupied in each bay by\r\nthe vast clearstory window filled with simple but effective geometric\r\ntracery over slender mullions. The side aisles were lighted by windows\r\nwhich, like those in the clearstory, occupied nearly the whole available\r\nwall-space under the vaulting. The piers and shafts were all clustered\r\nand remarkably slender. The whole construction of this vast edifice,\r\nwhich covers nearly eighty thousand square feet, is a marvel of\r\nlightness, of scientific combinations, and of fine execution. Its great\r\nvault rises to a height of one hundred and forty feet. The nave of St.\r\nDenis, though less lofty, resembles it closely in style (Fig. 120).\r\nEarlier cathedrals show less of the harmony of proportion, the perfect\r\nworking out of the relation of all parts of the composition of each bay,\r\nso conspicuous in the Amiens type, which was followed in most of the\r\nlater churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 120.--ONE BAY, ABBEY OF ST. DENIS.]\r\n\r\n+WINDOWS: TRACERY.+ The clearstory windows of Noyon, Soissons, Sens, and\r\nthe choir of Vézelay (1200) were simple arched openings arranged singly,\r\nin pairs, or in threes. In the cathedral of Chartres (1194-1220) they\r\nconsist of two arched windows with a circle above them, forming a sort\r\nof plate tracery under a single arch. In the chapel windows of the choir\r\nat Reims (1215) the tracery of mullions and circles was moulded inside\r\nand out, and the intermediate triangular spaces all pierced and glazed.\r\nRose windows were early used in front and transept façades. During the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries they were made of vast size and\r\ngreat lightness of tracery, as in the transepts of Notre Dame (1257) and\r\nthe west front of Amiens (1288). From the design of these windows is\r\nderived the name _Rayonnant_, often applied to the French Gothic style\r\nof the period 1275-1375.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE SAINTE CHAPELLE.+ In this beautiful royal chapel at Paris, built\r\n1242-47, Gothic design was admirably exemplified in the noble windows 15\r\nby 50 feet in size, which perhaps furnished the models for those of\r\nAmiens and St. Denis. Each was divided by slender mullions into four\r\nlancet-like lights gathered under the rich tracery of the window-head.\r\nThey were filled with stained glass of the most brilliant but harmonious\r\nhues. They occupy the whole available wall-space, so that the ribbed\r\nvault internally seems almost to rest on walls of glass, so slender are\r\nthe visible supports and so effaced by the glow of color in the windows.\r\nCertainly lightness of construction and the suppression of the\r\nwall-masonry could hardly be carried further than here (Fig. 121). Among\r\nother chapels of the same type are those in the palace of St.\r\nGermain-en-Laye (1240), and a later example in the château of Vincennes,\r\nbegun by Charles VI., but not finished till 1525.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 121.--THE STE. CHAPELLE, PARIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+PLANS.+ The most radical change from the primitive basilican type was,\r\nas already explained in the last chapter, the continuation of the side\r\naisles around the apse to form a _chevet_; and later, the addition of\r\nchapels between the external buttresses. Radiating chapels, usually\r\nsemi-octagons or semi-decagons in plan, early appeared as additions to\r\nthe _chevet_ (Fig. 122). These may have originated in the apsidal\r\nchapels of Romanesque churches in Auvergne and the South, as at Issoire,\r\nClermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and Toulouse. They generally superseded the\r\ntransept-chapels of earlier churches, and added greatly to the beauty of\r\nthe interior perspective, especially when the encircling aisles of the\r\nchevet were doubled. Notre Dame, as at first erected, had a double\r\nambulatory, but no chapels. Bourges has only five very small\r\nsemicircular chapels. Chartres (choir 1220) and Le Mans, as\r\nreconstructed about the same date, have double ambulatories and radial\r\nchapels. After 1220 the second ambulatory no longer appears. Noyon,\r\nSoissons, Reims, Amiens, Troyes, and Beauvais, Tours, Bayeux, and\r\nCoutances, Clermont, Limoges, and Narbonne all have the single\r\nambulatory and radiating chevet-chapels. The Lady-chapel in the axis of\r\nthe church was often made longer and more important than the other\r\nchapels, as at Amiens, Le Mans, Rouen, Bayeux, and Coutances. Chapels\r\nalso flanked the choir in most of the cathedrals named above, and Notre\r\nDame and Tours also have side chapels to the nave. The only cathedrals\r\nwith complete double side aisles alike to nave, choir, and chevet, were\r\nNotre Dame and Bourges. It is somewhat singular that the German\r\ncathedral of Cologne is the only one in which all these various\r\ncharacteristic French features were united in one design (see Fig. 140).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 122.--PLAN OF AMIENS CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nLocal considerations had full sway in France, in spite of the tendency\r\ntoward unity of type. Thus Dol, Laon, and Poitiers have square eastward\r\nterminations; Châlons has no ambulatory; Bourges no transept. In Notre\r\nDame the transept was almost suppressed. At Soissons one transept, at\r\nNoyon both, had semicircular ends. +Alby+, a late cathedral of brick,\r\nfounded in 1280, but mostly built during the fourteenth century, has\r\nneither side aisles nor transepts, its wide nave being flanked by\r\nchapels separated by internal buttresses (Fig. 123).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 123.--PLAN OF CATHEDRAL OF ALBY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+SCALE.+ The French cathedrals were nearly all of imposing dimensions.\r\nNoyon, one of the smallest, is 333 feet long; Sens measures 354. Laon,\r\nBourges, Troyes, Notre Dame, Le Mans, Rouen, and Chartres vary from 396\r\nto 437 feet in extreme length; Reims measures 483, and Amiens, the\r\nlongest of all, 521 feet. Notre Dame is 124 feet wide across the five\r\naisles of the nave; Bourges, somewhat wider. The central aisles of these\r\ntwo cathedrals, and of Laon, Amiens, and Beauvais, have a span of not\r\nfar from 40 feet from centre to centre of the piers; while the ridge of\r\nthe vaulting, which in Notre Dame is 108 feet above the pavement, and in\r\nBourges 125, reaches in Amiens a height of 140 feet, and of nearly 160\r\nin Beauvais. This emphasis of the height, from 3 to 3½ times the clear\r\nwidth of the nave or choir, is one of the most striking features of the\r\nFrench cathedrals. It produces an impressive effect, but tends to dwarf\r\nthe great width of the central aisle.\r\n\r\n\r\n+EXTERIOR DESIGN.+ Here, as in the interior, every feature had its\r\nconstructive _raison d’être_, and the total effect was determined by the\r\nfundamental structural scheme. This was especially true of the lateral\r\nelevations, in which the pinnacled buttresses, the flying arches, and\r\nthe traceried windows of the side aisle and clearstory, repeated\r\nuniformly at each bay, were the principal elements of the design. The\r\ntransept façades and main front allowed greater scope for invention and\r\nfancy, but even here the interior membering gave the key to the\r\ncomposition. Strong buttresses marked the division of the aisles and\r\nresisted the thrust of the terminal pier arches, and rose windows filled\r\nthe greater part of the wall space under the end of the lofty vaulting.\r\nThe whole structure was crowned by a steep-pitched roof of wood, covered\r\nwith lead, copper, or tiles, to protect the vault from damage by snow\r\nand moisture. This roof occasioned the steep gables which crowned the\r\ntransept and main façades. The main front was frequently adorned, above\r\nthe triple portal, with a gallery of niches or tabernacles filled with\r\nstatues of kings. Different types of composition are represented by\r\nChartres, Notre Dame, Amiens, Reims, and Rouen, of which Notre Dame\r\n(Fig. 124) and Reims are perhaps the finest. Notre Dame is especially\r\nremarkable for its stately simplicity and the even balancing of\r\nhorizontal and vertical elements.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 124.--WEST FRONT OF NOTRE DAME, PARIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 125.--WEST FRONT OF ST. MACLOU, ROUEN.]\r\n\r\n+PORCHES.+ In most French church façades the porches were the most\r\nstriking features, with their deep shadows and sculptured arches. The\r\nRomanesque porches were usually limited in depth to the thickness of the\r\nfront wall. The Gothic builders secured increased depth by projecting\r\nthe portals out beyond the wall, and crowned them with elaborate gables.\r\nThe vast central door was divided in two by a pier adorned with a niche\r\nand statue. Over this the tympanum of the arch was carved with\r\nscriptural reliefs; the jambs and arches were profusely adorned with\r\nfigures of saints, apostles, martyrs, and angels, under elaborate\r\ncanopies. The porches of Laon, Bourges, Amiens, and Reims are especially\r\ndeep and majestic in effect, the last-named (built 1380) being the\r\nrichest of all. Some of the transept façades also had imposing portals.\r\nThose of +Chartres+ (1210-1245) rank among the finest works of Gothic\r\ndecorative architecture, the south porch in some respects surpassing\r\nthat of the north transept. The portals of the fifteenth and early\r\nsixteenth centuries were remarkable for the extraordinary richness and\r\nminuteness of their tracery and sculpture, as at Abbeville, Alençon, the\r\ncathedral and St. Maclou at Rouen (Fig. 125), Tours, Troyes, Vendôme,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n+TOWERS AND SPIRES.+ The emphasizing of vertical elements reached its\r\nfullest expression in the towers and spires of the churches. What had\r\nbeen at first merely a lofty belfry roof was rapidly developed into the\r\nspire, rising three hundred feet or more into the air. This development\r\nhad already made progress in the Romanesque period, and the south spire\r\nof Chartres is a notable example of late twelfth-century steeple design.\r\nThe transition from the square tower to the slender octagonal pyramid\r\nwas skilfully effected by means of corner pinnacles and dormers. During\r\nand after the thirteenth century the development was almost wholly in\r\nthe direction of richness and complexity of detail, not of radical\r\nconstructive modification. The northern spire of Chartres (1515) and the\r\nspires of Bordeaux, Coutances, Senlis, and the Flamboyant church of St.\r\nMaclou at Rouen, illustrate this development. In Normandy central spires\r\nwere common, rising over the crossing of nave and transepts. In some\r\ncases the designers of cathedrals contemplated a group of towers; this\r\nis evident at Chartres, Coutances, and Reims. This intention was,\r\nhowever, never realized; it demanded resources beyond even the\r\nenthusiasm of the thirteenth century. Only in rare instances were the\r\nspires of any of the towers completed, and the majority of the French\r\ntowers have square terminations, with low-pitched wooden roofs,\r\ngenerally invisible from below. In general, French towers are marked by\r\ntheir strong buttresses, solid lower stories, twin windows in each side\r\nof the belfry proper--these windows being usually of great size--and a\r\nskilful management of the transition to an octagonal plan for the belfry\r\nor the spire.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CARVING AND SCULPTURE.+ The general superiority of French Gothic work\r\nwas fully maintained in its decorative details. Especially fine is the\r\nfigure sculpture, which in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\r\nattained true nobility of expression, combined with great truthfulness\r\nand delicacy of execution. Some of its finest productions are found in\r\nthe great doorway jambs of the west portals of the cathedrals, and in\r\nthe ranks of throned and adoring angels which adorned their deep arches.\r\nThese reach their highest beauty in the portals of Reims (1380). The\r\n_tabernacles_ or carved niches in which such statues were set were\r\nimportant elements in the decoration of the exteriors of churches.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 126.--FRENCH GOTHIC CAPITALS.\r\n  _a_, From Sainte Chapelle, Paris, 13th century. _b_, 14th-century\r\n  capital from transept of Notre Dame, Paris. _c_, 15th-century\r\n  capital from north spire of Chartres.]\r\n\r\nFoliage forms were used for nearly all the minor carved ornaments,\r\nthough grotesque and human figures sometimes took their place. The\r\ngargoyles through which the roof-water was discharged clear of the\r\nbuilding, were almost always composed in the form of hideous monsters;\r\nand symbolic beasts, like the oxen in the towers of Laon, or monsters\r\nlike those which peer from the tower balustrades of Notre Dame, were\r\nemployed with some mystical significance in various parts of the\r\nbuilding. But the capitals corbels, crockets, and finials were mostly\r\ncomposed of floral or foliage forms. Those of the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies were for the most part simple in mass, and crisp and vigorous\r\nin design, imitating the strong shoots of early spring. The +capitals+\r\nwere tall and slender, concave in profile, with heavy square or\r\noctagonal abaci. With the close of the thirteenth century this simple\r\nand forcible style of detail disappeared. The carving became more\r\nrealistic; the leaves, larger and more mature, were treated as if\r\napplied to the capital or moulding, not as if they grew out of it. The\r\nexecution and detail were finer and more delicate, in harmony with the\r\nincreasing slenderness and lightness of the architecture (Fig. 126 a,\r\nb). +Tracery forms+ now began to be profusely applied to all manner of\r\nsurfaces, and open-work gables, wholly unnecessary from the structural\r\npoint of view, but highly effective as decorations, adorned the portals\r\nand crowned the windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n+LATE GOTHIC MONUMENTS.+ So far our attention has been mainly occupied\r\nwith the masterpieces erected previous to 1250. Among the cathedrals,\r\nrelatively few in number, whose construction is referable to the second\r\nhalf of the century, that of +Beauvais+ stands first in importance.\r\nDesigned on a colossal scale, its foundations were laid in 1225, but it\r\nwas never completed, and the portion built--the choir and\r\nchapels--belonged really to the second half of the century, having been\r\ncompleted in 1270. But the collapse in 1284 of the central tower and\r\nvaulting of this incomplete cathedral, owing to the excessive loftiness\r\nand slenderness of its supports, compelled its entire reconstruction,\r\nthe number of the piers being doubled and the span of the pier arches\r\ncorrespondingly reduced. As thus rebuilt, the cathedral aisle was 47\r\nfeet wide from centre to centre of opposite piers, and 163 feet high to\r\nthe top of the vault. Transepts were added after 1500. +Limoges+ and\r\n+Narbonne+, begun in 1272 on a large scale (though not equal in size to\r\nBeauvais), were likewise never completed. Both had choirs of admirable\r\nplan, with well-designed chevet-chapels. Many other cathedrals begun\r\nduring this period were completed only after long delays, as, for\r\ninstance, Meaux, Rodez (1277), Toulouse (1272), and Alby (1282),\r\nfinished in the sixteenth century, and Clermont (1248), completed under\r\nNapoleon III. But between 1260 or 1275 and 1350, work was actively\r\nprosecuted on many still incomplete cathedrals. The choirs of Beauvais\r\n(rebuilding), Limoges, and Narbonne were finished after 1330; and\r\ntowers, transept-façades, portals, and chapels added to many others of\r\nearlier date.\r\n\r\nThe style of this period is sometimes designated as +Rayonnant+, from\r\nthe characteristic wheel tracery of the rose-windows, and the prevalence\r\nof circular forms in the lateral arched windows, of the late thirteenth\r\nand early fourteenth centuries. The great rose windows in the transepts\r\nof Notre Dame, dating from 1257, are typical examples of the style.\r\nThose of Rouen cathedral belong to the same category, though of later\r\ndate. The façade of Amiens, completed by 1288, is one of the finest\r\nworks of this style, of which an early example is the elaborate parish\r\nchurch of +St. Urbain+ at Troyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE FLAMBOYANT STYLE.+ The geometric treatment of the tracery and the\r\nminute and profuse decoration of this period gradually merged into the\r\nfantastic and unrestrained extravagances of the +Flamboyant+ style,\r\nwhich prevailed until the advent of the Renaissance--say 1525. The\r\ncontinuous logical development of forms ceased, and in its place caprice\r\nand display controlled the arts of design. The finest monument of this\r\nlong period is the fifteenth-century nave and central tower of the\r\nchurch of +St. Ouen+ at Rouen, a parish church of the first rank, begun\r\nin 1318, but not finished until 1515. The tracery of the lateral windows\r\nis still chiefly geometric, but the western rose window (Fig. 112) and\r\nthe magnificent central tower or lantern, exhibit in their tracery the\r\nflorid decoration and wavy, flame-like lines of this style. Slenderness\r\nof supports and the suppression of horizontal lines are here carried to\r\nan extreme; and the church, in spite of its great elegance of detail,\r\nlacks the vital interest and charm of the earlier Gothic churches. The\r\ncathedral of Alençon and the church of +St. Maclou+ at Rouen, have\r\nportals with unusually elaborate detail of tracery and carving; while\r\nthe façade of Rouen cathedral (1509) surpasses all other examples in the\r\nlace-like minuteness of its open-work and its profusion of ornament. The\r\nchurches of +St. Jacques+ at Dieppe, and of +St. Wulfrand+ at Abbeville,\r\nthe façades of Tours and Troyes, are among the masterpieces of the\r\nstyle. The upper part of the façade of Reims (1380-1428) belongs to the\r\ntransition from the Rayonnant to the Flamboyant. While some works of\r\nthis period are conspicuous for the richness of their ornamentation,\r\nothers are noticeably bare and poor in design, like St. Merri and St.\r\nSéverin in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n+SECULAR AND MONASTIC ARCHITECTURE.+ The building of cathedrals did not\r\nabsorb all the architectural activity of the French during the Gothic\r\nperiod, nor did it by any means put an end to monastic building. While\r\nthere are few Gothic cloisters to equal the Romanesque cloisters of\r\nPuy-en-Vélay, Montmajour, Elne, and Moissac, many of the abbeys either\r\nrebuilt their churches in the Gothic style after 1150, or extended and\r\nremodelled their conventual buildings. The cloisters of Fontfroide,\r\nChaise-Dieu, and the Mont St. Michel rival those of Romanesque times,\r\nwhile many new refectories and chapels were built in the same style with\r\nthe cathedrals. The most complete of these Gothic monastic\r\nestablishments, that of the +Mont St. Michel+ in Normandy, presented a\r\nremarkable aggregation of buildings clustering around the steep isolated\r\nrock on which stands the abbey church. This was built in the eleventh\r\ncentury, and the choir and chapels remodelled in the sixteenth. The\r\ngreat refectory and dormitory, the cloisters, lodgings, and chapels,\r\nbuilt in several vaulted stories against the cliffs, are admirable\r\nexamples of the vigorous pointed-arch design of the early thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n+Hospitals+ like that of St. Jean at Angers (late twelfth century), or\r\nthose of Chartres, Ourscamps, Tonnerre, and Beaune, illustrate how\r\nskilfully the French could modify and adapt the details of their\r\narchitecture to the special requirements of civil architecture. Great\r\nnumbers of charitable institutions were built in the middle\r\nages--asylums, hospitals, refuges, and the like--but very few of those\r\nin France are now extant. Town halls were built in the fifteenth century\r\nin some places where a certain amount of popular independence had been\r\nsecured. The florid fifteenth-century +Palais de Justice+ at +Rouen+\r\n(1499-1508) is an example of another branch of secular Gothic\r\narchitecture. In all these monuments the adaptation of means to ends is\r\nadmirable. Wooden ceilings and roofs replaced stone, wherever required\r\nby great width of span or economy of construction. There was little\r\nsculpture; the wall-spaces were not suppressed in favor of stained glass\r\nand tracery; while the roofs were usually emphasized and adorned with\r\nelaborate crestings and finials in lead or terra-cotta.\r\n\r\n\r\n+DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.+ These same principles controlled the designing\r\nof houses, farm buildings, barns, granaries, and the like. The common\r\nclosely-built French city house of the twelfth and thirteenth century is\r\nillustrated by many extant examples at Cluny, Provins, and other towns.\r\nA shop opening on the street by a large arch, a narrow stairway, and two\r\nor three stories of rooms lighted by clustered, pointed-arched windows,\r\nconstituted the common type. The street front was usually gabled and the\r\nroof steep. In the fourteenth or fifteenth century half-timbered\r\nconstruction began to supersede stone for town houses, as it permitted\r\nof encroaching upon the street by projecting the upper stories. Many of\r\nthe half-timbered houses of the fifteenth century were of elaborate\r\ndesign. The heavy oaken uprights were carved with slender colonnettes;\r\nthe horizontal sills, bracketed out over the street, were richly\r\nmoulded; picturesque dormers broke the sky-line, and the masonry filling\r\nbetween the beams was frequently faced with enamelled tiles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 127.--HOUSE OF JACQUES CŒUR, BOURGES.\r\n  (After Viollet-le-Duc.)]\r\n\r\nThe more considerable houses or palaces of royalty, nobles, and wealthy\r\ncitizens rivalled, and in time surpassed, the monastic buildings in\r\nrichness and splendor. The earlier examples retain the military aspect,\r\nwith moat and donjon, as in the Louvre of Charles V., demolished in the\r\nsixteenth century. The finest palaces are of late date, and the type is\r\nwell represented by the Ducal Palace at Nancy (1476), the +Hotel de\r\nCluny+ (1485) at Paris, the +Hotel Jacques Cœur+ at Bourges (Fig. 127),\r\nand the east wing of Blois (1498-1515). These palaces are not only\r\nexcellently and liberally planned, with large halls, many staircases,\r\nand handsome courts; they are also extremely picturesque with their\r\nsquare and circular towers, slender turrets, elaborate dormers, and rich\r\ncarved detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS+: (C. = cathedral; A. = abbey; trans. = transept; each\r\n  edifice is given under the date of its commencement; subsequent\r\n  alterations in parentheses.)

Many of the\r\ncathedrals had monastic chapters, and not infrequently abbots were\r\ninvested with the episcopal rank.\r\n\r\nEnglish Gothic architecture was thus by no means predominantly an\r\narchitecture of cathedrals. If architectural activity in England was on\r\nthis account less intense and widespread in the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies than in France, it was not, on the other hand, so soon\r\nexhausted. Fewer new cathedrals were built, but the progressive\r\nrebuilding of those already existing seems not to have ceased until the\r\nmiddle or end of the fifteenth century. Architecture in England\r\ndeveloped more slowly, but more uniformly than in France. It contented\r\nitself with simpler problems; and if it failed to rival Amiens in\r\nboldness of construction and in lofty majesty, it at least never\r\nperpetrated a folly like Beauvais. In richness of internal decoration,\r\nespecially in the mouldings and ribbed vaulting, and in the picturesque\r\ngrouping of simple masses externally, the British builders went far\r\ntoward atoning for their structural timidity.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 128.--PLAN OF SALISBURY CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+EARLY GOTHIC BUILDINGS.+ The pointed arch and ribbed vault were\r\nimportations from France. Early examples appear in the Cistercian abbeys\r\nof Furness and Kirkstall, and in the Temple Church at London (1185). But\r\nit was in the +Choir of Canterbury+, as rebuilt by William of Sens,\r\nafter the destruction by fire in 1170 of Anselm’s Norman choir, that\r\nthese French Gothic features were first applied in a thoroughgoing\r\nmanner. In plan this choir resembled that of the cathedral of Sens; and\r\nits coupled round piers, with capitals carved with foliage, its pointed\r\narches, its six-part vaulting, and its _chevet_, were distinctly French.\r\nThe Gothic details thus introduced slowly supplanted the round arch and\r\nother Norman features. For fifty years the styles were more or less\r\nmingled in many buildings, though +Lincoln Cathedral+, as rebuilt in\r\n1185-1200, retained nothing of the earlier round-arched style. But the\r\nfirst church to be designed and built from the foundations in the new\r\nstyle was the cathedral of +Salisbury+ (1220-1258; Fig. 128).\r\nContemporary with Amiens, it is a homogeneous and typical example of the\r\nEarly English style. The predilection for great length observable in the\r\nAnglo-Norman churches (as at Norwich and Durham) still prevailed, as it\r\ncontinued to do throughout the Gothic period; Salisbury is 480 feet\r\nlong. The double transepts, the long choir, the square east end, the\r\nrelatively low vault (84 feet to the ridge), the narrow grouped windows,\r\nall are thoroughly English. Only the simple four-part vaulting recalls\r\nFrench models. +Westminster Abbey+ (1245-1269), on the other hand,\r\nbetrays in a marked manner the French influence in its internal\r\nloftiness (100 feet), its polygonal _chevet_ and chapels, and its\r\nstrongly accented exterior flying-buttresses (Fig. 137).\r\n\r\n\r\n+MIXTURE OF STYLES.+ Very few English cathedrals are as homogeneous as\r\nthe two just mentioned, nearly all having undergone repeated\r\nremodellings in successive periods. Durham, Norwich, and Oxford are\r\nwholly Norman but for their Gothic vaults. Ely, Rochester, Gloucester,\r\nand Hereford have Norman naves and Gothic choirs. Peterborough has an\r\nearly Gothic façade and late Gothic retro-choir added to an otherwise\r\ncompletely Norman structure. Winchester is a Norman church remodelled\r\nwith early Perpendicular details. The purely Gothic churches and\r\ncathedrals, except parish churches--in which England is very rich--are\r\nnot nearly as numerous in England as in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PERIODS.+ The development of English Gothic architecture followed the\r\nsame general sequence as the French, and like it the successive stages\r\nwere most conspicuously characterized by the forms of the tracery.\r\n\r\nThe EARLY ENGLISH or LANCET period extended roundly from 1175 or 1180 to\r\n1280, and was marked by simplicity, dignity, and purity of design.\r\n\r\nThe DECORATED or GEOMETRIC period covered another century, 1280 to 1380,\r\nand was characterized by its decorative richness and greater lightness\r\nof construction.\r\n\r\nThe PERPENDICULAR period extended from 1380, or thereabout, well into\r\nthe sixteenth century. Its salient features were the use of\r\nfan-vaulting, four-centred arches, and tracery of predominantly vertical\r\nand horizontal lines. The tardy introduction of Renaissance forms\r\nfinally put an end to the Gothic style in England, after a long period\r\nof mixed and transitional architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 129.--RIBBED VAULTING,\r\n  CHOIR OF EXETER CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n+VAULTING.+ The richness and variety of English vaulting contrast\r\nstrikingly with the persistent uniformity of the French. A few of the\r\nearly Gothic vaults, as in the aisles of Peterborough, and later the\r\nnaves of Durham, Salisbury, and Gloucester, were simple four-part,\r\nribbed vaults substantially like the French. But the English disliked\r\nand avoided the twisted and dome-like surfaces of the French vaults,\r\npreferring horizontal ridges, and, in the filling-masonry, straight\r\ncourses meeting at the ridge in zigzag lines, as in southwest France\r\n(see p. 200). This may be seen in Westminster Abbey. The idea of ribbed\r\nconstruction was then seized upon and given a new application. By\r\nspringing a large number of ribs from each point of support, the\r\nvaulting-surfaces were divided into long, narrow, triangles, the filling\r\nof which was comparatively easy (Fig. 129). The ridge was itself\r\nfurnished with a straight rib, decorated with carved rosettes or\r\n_bosses_ at each intersection with a vaulting-rib. The naves and choirs\r\nof Lincoln, Lichfield, Exeter, and the nave of Westminster illustrate\r\nthis method. The logical corollary of this practice was the introduction\r\nof minor ribs called _liernes_, connecting the main ribs and forming\r\ncomplex reticulated and star-shaped patterns. Vaults of this description\r\nare among the most beautiful in England. One of the richest is in the\r\nchoir of Gloucester (1337-1377). Less correct constructively is that\r\nover the choir of Wells, while the choir of Ely, the nave of Tewkesbury\r\nAbbey (Fig. 130), and all the vaulting of Winchester as rebuilt by\r\nWilliam of Wykeham (1390), illustrate the same system. Such vaults are\r\ncalled _lierne_ or _star_ vaults.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 130.--NET OR LIERNE VAULTING,\r\n  TEWKESBURY ABBEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+FAN-VAULTING.+ The next step in the process may be observed in the\r\nvaults of the choir of Oxford Cathedral (Christ Church), of the\r\nretro-choir of Peterborough, of the cloisters of Gloucester, and many\r\nother examples. The diverging ribs being made of uniform curvature, the\r\n_severeys_ (the inverted pyramidal vaulting-masses springing from each\r\nsupport) became a species of concave conoids, meeting at the ridge in\r\nsuch a way as to leave a series of flat lozenge-shaped spaces at the\r\nsummit of the vault (Fig. 136). The ribs were multiplied indefinitely,\r\nand losing thus in individual and structural importance became a mere\r\ndecorative pattern of tracery on the severeys. To conceal the awkward\r\nflat lozenges at the ridge, elaborate panelling was resorted to; or, in\r\nsome cases, long stone pendents were inserted at those points--a device\r\nhighly decorative but wholly unconstructive. At Cambridge, in +King’s\r\nCollege Chapel+, at Windsor, in +St. George’s Chapel+, and in the\r\n+Chapel of Henry VII.+ at Westminster, this sort of vaulting received\r\nits most elaborate development. The _fan-vault_, as it is called,\r\nillustrates the logical evolution of a decorative element from a\r\nstructural starting--point, leading to results far removed from the\r\noriginal conception. Rich and sumptuous as are these ceilings, they are\r\nwith all their ornament less satisfactory than the ribbed vaults of the\r\npreceding period.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 131.--VAULT OF CHAPTER-HOUSE, WELLS.]\r\n\r\n+CHAPTER-HOUSES.+ One of the most beautiful forms of ribbed vaulting was\r\ndeveloped in the polygonal halls erected for the deliberations of the\r\ncathedral chapters of Lincoln (1225), Westminster (1250), Salisbury\r\n(1250), and Wells (1292), in which the vault-ribs radiated from a\r\ncentral column to the sides and angles of the polygon (Fig. 131). If\r\nthese vaults were less majestic than domes of the same diameter, they\r\nwere far more decorative and picturesque, while the chapter-houses\r\nthemselves were the most original and striking products of English\r\nGothic art. Every feature was designed with strict regard for the\r\nstructural system determined by the admirable vaulting, and the Sainte\r\nChapelle was not more logical in its exemplification of Gothic\r\nprinciples. To the four above-mentioned examples should be added that of\r\nYork (1280-1330), which differs from them in having no central column:\r\nby some critics it is esteemed the finest of them all. Its ceiling is a\r\nGothic dome, 57 feet in diameter, but unfortunately executed in wood.\r\nIts geometrical window-tracery and richly canopied stalls are admirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n+OCTAGON AT ELY.+ The magnificent +Octagon+ of Ely Cathedral, at the\r\nintersection of the nave and transepts, belongs in the same category\r\nwith these polygonal chapter-house vaults. It was built by Alan of\r\nWalsingham in 1337, after the fall of the central tower and the\r\ndestruction of the adjacent bays of the choir. It occupies the full\r\nwidth of the three aisles, and covers the ample space thus enclosed with\r\na simple but beautiful groined and ribbed vault of wood reaching to a\r\ncentral octagonal lantern, which rises much higher and shows externally\r\nas well as internally. Unfortunately, this vault is of wood, and would\r\nrequire important modifications of detail if carried out in stone. But\r\nit is so noble in general design and total effect, that one wonders the\r\ntype was not universally adopted for the crossing in all cathedrals,\r\nuntil one observes that no cathedral of importance was built after\r\nWalsingham’s time, nor did any other central towers opportunely fall to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n+WINDOWS AND TRACERY.+ In the Early English Period (1200-1280 or 1300)\r\nthe windows were tall and narrow (_lancet_ windows), and generally\r\ngrouped by twos and threes, though sometimes four and even five are seen\r\ntogether (as the “Five Sisters” in the N. transept of York). In the nave\r\nof Salisbury and the retro-choir of Ely the side aisles are lighted by\r\ncoupled windows and the clearstory by triple windows, the central one\r\nhigher than the others--a surviving Norman practice. Plate-tracery was,\r\nas in France, an intermediate step leading to the development of\r\nbar-tracery (see Fig. 110). The English followed here the same reasoning\r\nas the French. At first the openings constituted the design, the\r\nintervening stonework being of secondary importance. Later the forms of\r\nthe openings were subordinated to the pattern of the stone framework of\r\nbars, arches, circles, and cusps. Bar-tracery of this description\r\nprevailed in England through the greater part of the Decorated Period\r\n(1280-1380), and somewhat resembled the contemporary French geometric\r\ntracery, though more varied and less rigidly constructive in design. An\r\nearly example of this tracery occurs in the cloisters of Salisbury (Fig.\r\n132); others in the clearstories of the choirs of Lichfield, Lincoln,\r\nand Ely, the nave of York, and the chapter-houses mentioned above,\r\nwhere, indeed, it seems to have received its earliest development. After\r\nthe middle of the fourteenth century lines of double curvature were\r\nintroduced, producing what is called _flowing_ tracery, somewhat\r\nresembling the French flamboyant, though earlier in date (Fig. 111).\r\nExamples of this style are found in Wells, in the side aisles and\r\ntriforium of the choir of Ely, and in the S. transept rose-window of\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 132.--CLOISTERS, SALISBURY CATHEDRAL\r\n  (SHOWING UPPER PART OF CHAPTER-HOUSE).]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 133.--PERPENDICULAR TRACERY,\r\n  WEST WINDOW OF ST. GEORGE’S, WINDSOR.]\r\n\r\n+THE PERPENDICULAR STYLE.+ Flowing tracery was, however, a transitional\r\nphase of design, and was soon superseded by _Perpendicular_ tracery, in\r\nwhich the mullions were carried through to the top of the arch and\r\nintersected by horizontal transoms. This formed a very rigid and\r\nmechanically correct system of stone framing, but lacked the grace and\r\ncharm of the two preceding periods. The earliest examples are seen in\r\nthe work of Edington and of Wykeham in the reconstructed cathedral of\r\nWinchester (1360-1394), where the tracery was thus made to harmonize\r\nwith the accentuated and multiplied vertical lines of the interior\r\ndesign. It was at this late date that the English seem first to have\r\nfully appropriated the Gothic ideas of emphasized vertical elements and\r\nwall surfaces reduced to a minimum. The development of fan-vaulting had\r\nled to the adoption of a new form of arch, the four-centred or _Tudor\r\narch_ (Fig. 133), to fit under the depressed apex of the vault. The\r\nwhole design internally and externally was thenceforward controlled by\r\nthe form of the vaulting and of the openings. The windows were made of\r\nenormous size, especially at the east end of the choir, which was square\r\nin nearly all English churches, and in the west windows over the\r\nentrance. These windows had already reached, in the Decorated Period, an\r\nenormous size, as at York; in the Perpendicular Period the two ends of\r\nthe church were as nearly as possible converted into walls of glass. The\r\nEast Window of Gloucester reaches the prodigious dimensions of 38 by 72\r\nfeet. The most complete examples of the Perpendicular tracery and of the\r\nstyle in general are the three chapels already mentioned (p. 223);\r\nthose, namely, of +King’s College+ at Cambridge, of +St. George+ at\r\nWindsor, and of +Henry VII.+ in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CONSTRUCTIVE DESIGN.+ The most striking peculiarity of English Gothic\r\ndesign was its studious avoidance of temerity or venturesomeness in\r\nconstruction. Both the height and width of the nave were kept within\r\nvery moderate bounds, and the supports were never reduced to extreme\r\nslenderness. While much impressiveness of effect was undoubtedly lost\r\nthereby, there was some gain in freedom of design, and there was less\r\nobtrusion of constructive elements in the exterior composition. The\r\nflying-buttress became a feature of minor importance where the\r\nclearstory was kept low, as in most English churches. In many cases the\r\nflying arches were hidden under the aisle roofs. The English cathedrals\r\nand larger churches are long and low, depending for effect mainly upon\r\nthe projecting masses of their transepts, the imposing square central\r\ntowers which commonly crown the crossing, and the grouping of the main\r\nstructure with chapter-houses, cloisters, and Lady-chapels.\r\n\r\n\r\n+FRONTS.+ The sides and east ends were, in most cases, more successful\r\nthan the west fronts. In these the English displayed a singular\r\nindifference or lack of creative power. They produced nothing to rival\r\nthe majestic façades of Notre Dame, Amiens, or Reims, and their portals\r\nare almost ridiculously small. The front of +York+ Cathedral is the most\r\nnotable in the list for its size and elaborate decoration. Those of\r\n+Lincoln+ and +Peterborough+ are, however, more interesting in the\r\npicturesqueness and singularity of their composition. The first-named\r\nforms a vast arcaded screen, masking the bases of the two western\r\ntowers, and pierced by three huge Norman arches, retained from the\r\noriginal façade. The west front of Peterborough is likewise a mask or\r\nscreen, mainly composed of three colossal recessed arches, whose vast\r\nscale completely dwarfs the little porches which give admittance to the\r\nchurch. Salisbury has a curiously illogical and ineffective façade.\r\nThose of +Lichfield+ and +Wells+ are, on the other hand, imposing and\r\nbeautiful designs, the first with its twin spires and rich arcading\r\n(Fig. 134), the second with its unusual wealth of figure-sculpture, and\r\nmassive square towers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 134.--WEST FRONT, LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+CENTRAL TOWERS.+ These are the most successful features of English\r\nexterior design. Most of them form lanterns internally over the\r\ncrossing, giving to that point a considerable increase of dignity.\r\nExternally they are usually massive and lofty square towers, and having\r\nbeen for the most part completed during the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies they are marked by great richness and elegance of detail.\r\nDurham, York, Ely, Canterbury, Lincoln, and Gloucester maybe mentioned\r\nas notable examples of such square towers; that of Canterbury is the\r\nfinest. Two or three have lofty spires over the lantern. Among these,\r\nthat of Salisbury is chief, rising 424 feet from the ground, admirably\r\ndesigned in every detail. It was not completed till the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century, but most fortunately carries out with great felicity\r\nthe spirit of the earlier style in which it was begun. Lichfield and\r\nChichester have somewhat similar central spires, but less happy in\r\nproportion and detail than the beautiful Salisbury example.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 135.--ONE BAY OF CHOIR, LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+INTERIOR DESIGN.+ In the Norman churches the pier-arches, triforium,\r\nand clearstory were practically equal. In the Gothic churches the\r\npier-arches generally occupy the lower half of the height, the upper\r\nhalf being divided nearly equally between the triforium and clearstory,\r\nas in Lincoln, Lichfield (nave), Ely (choir). In some cases, however (as\r\nat Salisbury, Westminster, Winchester, choir of Lichfield), the\r\nclearstory is magnified at the expense of the triforium (Fig. 135).\r\nThree peculiarities of design sharply distinguish the English treatment\r\nof these features from the French. The first is the multiplicity of fine\r\nmouldings in the pier-arches; the second is the decorative elaboration\r\nof design in the triforium; the third, the variety in the treatment of\r\nthe clearstory. In general the English interiors are much more ornate\r\nthan the French. Black Purbeck marble is frequently used for the shafts\r\nclustered around the central core of the pier, giving a striking and\r\nsomewhat singular effect of contrasted color. The rich vaulting, the\r\nhighly decorated triforium, the moulded pier-arches, and at the end of\r\nthe vista the great east window, produce an impression very different\r\nfrom the more simple and lofty stateliness of the French cathedrals. The\r\ngreat length and lowness of the English interiors combine with this\r\ndecorative richness to give the impression of repose and grace, rather\r\nthan of majesty and power. This tendency reached its highest expression\r\nin the Perpendicular churches and chapels, in which every surface was\r\ncovered with minute panelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CARVING.+ In the Early English Period the details were carved with a\r\ncombined delicacy and vigor deserving of the highest praise. In the\r\ncapitals and corbels, crockets and finials, the foliage was crisp and\r\nfine, curling into convex masses and seeming to spring from the surface\r\nwhich it decorated. Mouldings were frequently ornamented with foliage of\r\nthis character in the hollows, and another ornament, the _dog-tooth_ or\r\n_pyramid_, often served the same purpose, introducing repeated points of\r\nlight into the shadows of the mouldings. These were fine and complex,\r\ndeep hollows alternating with round mouldings (_bowtels_) sometimes made\r\npear-shaped in section by a fillet on one side. _Cusping_--the\r\ndecoration of an arch or circle by triangular projections on its inner\r\nedge--was introduced during this period, and became an important\r\ndecorative resource, especially in tracery design. In the Decorated\r\nPeriod the foliage was less crisp; sea-weed and oak-leaves, closely and\r\nconfusedly bunched, were used in the capitals, while crockets were\r\nlarger, double-curved, with leaves swelling into convexities like\r\noak-galls. Geometrical and flowing tracery were developed, and the\r\nmouldings of the tracery-bars, as of other features, lost somewhat in\r\nvigor and sharpness. The _ball-flower_ or button replaced the\r\ndog’s-tooth, and the hollows were less frequently adorned with foliage.\r\n\r\nIn the Perpendicular Period nearly all flat surfaces were panelled in\r\ndesigns resembling the tracery of the windows. The capitals were less\r\nimportant than those of the preceding periods, and the mouldings weaker\r\nand less effective. The Tudor rose appears as an ornament in square\r\npanels and on flat surfaces; and moulded battlements, which first\r\nappeared in Decorated work, now become a frequent crowning motive in\r\nplace of a cornice. There is less originality and variety in the\r\nornament, but a great increase in its amount (Fig. 136).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 136.--FAN-VAULTING, HENRY VII.’S CHAPEL,\r\n  WESTMINSTER ABBEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+PLANS.+ English church plans underwent, during the Gothic Period, but\r\nlittle change from the general types established previous to the\r\nthirteenth century. The Gothic cathedrals and abbeys, like the Norman,\r\nwere very long and narrow, with choirs often nearly as long as the nave,\r\nand almost invariably with square eastward terminations. There is no\r\nexample of double side aisles and side chapels, and apsidal chapels are\r\nvery rare. Canterbury and Westminster (Fig. 137) are the chief\r\nexceptions to this, and both show clearly the French influence. Another\r\nstriking peculiarity of the English plans is the frequent occurrence of\r\nsecondary transepts, adding greatly to the external picturesqueness.\r\nThese occur in rudimentary form in Canterbury, and at Durham the Chapel\r\nof the Nine Altars, added 1242-1290 to the eastern end, forms in reality\r\na secondary transept. This feature is most perfectly developed in the\r\ncathedral of Salisbury (Fig. 128), and appears also at Lincoln,\r\nWorcester, Wells, and a few other examples. The English cathedral plans\r\nare also distinguished by the retention or incorporation of many\r\nconventual features, such as cloisters, libraries, and halls, and by the\r\ngrouping of chapter-houses and Lady-chapels with the main edifice. Thus\r\nthe English cathedral plans and those of the great abbey churches\r\npresent a marked contrast with those of France and the Continent\r\ngenerally. While Amiens, the greatest of French cathedrals, is 521 feet\r\nlong, and internally 140 feet high, Ely measures 565 feet in length, and\r\nless than 75 feet in height. Notre Dame is 148 feet wide; the English\r\nnaves are usually under 80 feet in total width of the three aisles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 137.--EASTERN HALF OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY. PLAN.\r\n  a, _Henry VII.’s chapel._]\r\n\r\n\r\n+PARISH CHURCHES.+ Many of these were of exceptional beauty of\r\ncomposition and detail. They display the greatest variety of plan,\r\nchurches with two equal-gabled naves side by side being not uncommon.\r\nA considerable proportion of them date from the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies, and are chiefly interesting for their square, single, west\r\ntowers and their carved wooden ceilings (see below). The tower was\r\nusually built over the central western porch; broad and square, with\r\ncorner buttresses terminating in pinnacles, it was usually finished\r\nwithout spires. Crenelated battlements crowned the upper story. When\r\nspires were added the transition from the square tower to the octagonal\r\nspire was effected by _broaches_ or portions of a square pyramid\r\nintersecting the base of the spire, or by corner pinnacles and\r\nflying-buttresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 138.--ROOF OF NAVE, ST. MARY’S,\r\n  WESTONZOYLAND.]\r\n\r\n+WOODEN CEILINGS.+ The English treated woodwork with consummate skill.\r\nThey invented and developed a variety of forms of roof-truss in which\r\nthe proper distribution of the strains was combined with a highly\r\ndecorative treatment of the several parts by carving, moulding, and\r\narcading. The ceiling surfaces between the trusses were handled\r\ndecoratively, and the oaken open-timber ceilings of many of the English\r\nchurches and civic or academic halls (Christ Church Hall, Oxford;\r\nWestminster Hall, London) are such noble and beautiful works as quite to\r\njustify the substitution of wooden for vaulted ceilings (Fig. 138). The\r\n_hammer-beam_ truss was in its way as highly scientific, and\r\næsthetically as satisfactory, as any feature of French Gothic stone\r\nconstruction. Without the use of tie-rods to keep the rafters from\r\nspreading, it brought the strain of the roof upon internal brackets low\r\ndown on the wall, and produced a beautiful effect by the repetition of\r\nits graceful curves in each truss.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHAPELS AND HALLS.+ Many of these rival the cathedrals in beauty and\r\ndignity of design. The royal chapels at Windsor and Westminster have\r\nalready been mentioned, as well as King’s College Chapel at Cambridge,\r\nand Christ Church Hall at Oxford. To these college halls should be added\r\nthe chapel of Merton College at Oxford, and the beautiful chapel of St.\r\nStephen at Westminster, most unfortunately demolished when the present\r\nParliament House was erected. The Lady-chapels of Gloucester and Ely,\r\nthough connected with the cathedrals, are really independent designs of\r\nlate date, and remarkable for the richness of their decoration, their\r\ngreat windows, and elaborate ribbed vaulting. Some of the halls in\r\nmediæval castles and manor-houses are also worthy of note, especially\r\nfor their timber ceilings.\r\n\r\n\r\n+MINOR MONUMENTS.+ The student of Gothic architecture should also give\r\nattention to the choir-screens, tombs, and chantries which embellish\r\nmany of the abbeys and cathedrals. The rood-screen at York is a notable\r\nexample of the first; the tomb of De Gray in the same cathedral, and\r\ntombs and chantries in Canterbury, Winchester, Westminster Abbey, Ely,\r\nSt. Alban’s Abbey, and other churches are deservedly admired. In these\r\nthe English love for ornament, for minute carving, and for the contrast\r\nof white and colored marble, found unrestrained expression. To these\r\nshould be added the market-crosses of Salisbury and Winchester, and\r\nQueen Eleanor’s Cross at Waltham.\r\n\r\n\r\n+DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.+ The mediæval castles of Great Britain belong to\r\nthe domain of military engineering rather than of the history of art,\r\nthough occasionally presenting to view details of considerable\r\narchitectural beauty. The growth of peace and civic order is marked by\r\nthe erection of manor-houses, the residences of wealthy landowners. Some\r\nof these houses are of imposing size, and show the application to\r\ndomestic requirements, of the late Gothic style which prevailed in the\r\nperiod to which most of them belong. The windows are square or\r\nTudor-arched, with stone mullions and transoms of the Perpendicular\r\nstyle, and the walls terminate in merlons or crenelated parapets,\r\nrecalling the earlier military structures. The palace of the bishop or\r\narchbishop, adjoining the cathedral, and the residences of the dean,\r\ncanons, and clergy, together with the libraries, schools, and gates of\r\nthe cathedral enclosure, illustrate other phases of secular Gothic work.\r\nFew of these structures are of striking architectural merit, but they\r\npossess a picturesque charm which is very attractive.\r\n\r\nNot many stone houses of the smaller class remain from the Gothic period\r\nin England. But there is hardly an old town that does not retain many of\r\nthe half-timbered dwellings of the fifteenth or even fourteenth century,\r\nsome of them in excellent preservation. They are for the most part wider\r\nand lower than the French houses of the same class, but are built on the\r\nsame principle, and, like them, the woodwork is more or less richly\r\ncarved.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS+: (A. = abbey church; C. = cathedral; r. = ruined;\r\n  trans. = transept; each monument is given under the date of the\r\n  earliest extant Gothic work upon it, with additions of later\r\n  periods in parentheses.)\r\n\r\n  EARLY ENGLISH: Kirkstall A., 1152-82, first pointed arches;\r\n  Canterbury C., choir, 1175-84 (nave, 1378-1411; central tower,\r\n  1500); Lincoln C., choir, trans., 1192-1200 (vault, 1250; nave and\r\n  E. end, 1260-80); Lichfield C., 1200-50 (W. front, 1275;\r\n  presbytery, 1325); Worcester C., choir, 1203-18, nave partly\r\n  Norman (W. end, 1375-95); Chichester C., 1204-44 (spire rebuilt\r\n  17th century); Fountains A., 1205-46; Salisbury C., 1220-58\r\n  (cloister, chapter-h., 1263-84; spire, 1331); Elgin C., 1224-44;\r\n  Wells C., 1175-1206 (W. front 1225, choir later, chapter-h.,\r\n  1292); Rochester C., 1225-39 (nave Norman); York C., S. trans.,\r\n  1225; N. trans., 1260 (nave, chapter-h., 1291-1345; W. window,\r\n  1338; central tower, 1389-1407; E. window, 1407); Southwell\r\n  Minster, 1233-94 (nave Norman); Ripon C., 1233-94 (central tower,\r\n  1459); Ely C., choir, 1229-54 (nave Norman; octagon and\r\n  presbytery, 1323-62); Peterborough C., W. front, 1237 (nave\r\n  Norman; retro-choir, late 14th century); Netley A., 1239 (r.);\r\n  Durham C., “Nine Altars” and E. end choir, 1235-90 (nave, choir,\r\n  Norman; W. window, 1341; central tower finished, 1480);\r\n  Glasgow C., (with remarkable Early English crypt), 1242-77;\r\n  Gloucester C., nave vaulted, 1239-42 (nave mainly Norman; choir,\r\n  1337-51; cloisters, 1375-1412; W. end, 1420-37; central tower,\r\n  1450-57); Westminster A., 1245-69; St. Mary’s A., York, 1272-92\r\n  (r.).\r\n\r\n  DECORATED: Merton College Chapel, Oxford, 1274-1300; Hereford C.,\r\n  N. trans., chapter-h., cloisters, vaulting, 1275-92 (nave, choir,\r\n  Norman); Exeter C., choir, trans., 1279-91; nave, 1331-50 (E. end\r\n  remodelled, 1390); Lichfield C., Lady-chapel, 1310; Ely C.,\r\n  Lady-chapel, 1321-49; Melrose A., 1327-99 (nave, 1500; r.); St.\r\n  Stephen’s Chapel, Westminster, 1349-64 (demolished); Edington\r\n  church, 1352-61; Carlisle C., E. end and upper parts, 1352-95\r\n  (nave in part and S. trans.

The\r\nintroduction into Germany of the pointed style was tardy, and its\r\nprogress slow. Romanesque architecture had created imposing types of\r\necclesiastical architecture, which the conservative Teutons were slow to\r\nabandon. The result was a half-century of transition and a mingling of\r\nRomanesque and Gothic forms. St. Castor, at Coblentz, built as late as\r\n1208, is wholly Romanesque. Even when the pointed arch and vault had\r\nfinally come into general use, the plan and the constructive system\r\nstill remained predominantly Romanesque. The western apse and short\r\nsanctuary of the earlier plans were retained. There was no triforium,\r\nthe clearstory was insignificant, and the whole aspect low and massive.\r\nThe Germans avoided, at first, as did the English, the constructive\r\naudacities and difficulties of the French Gothic, but showed less of\r\ninvention and grace than their English neighbors. When, however, through\r\nthe influence of foreign models, especially of the great French\r\ncathedrals, and through the employment of foreign architects, the Gothic\r\nstyles were at last thoroughly domesticated, a spirit of ostentation\r\ntook the place of the earlier conservatism. Technical cleverness,\r\nexaggerated ingenuity of detail, and constructive _tours de force_\r\ncharacterize most of the German Gothic work of the late fourteenth and\r\nof the fifteenth century. This is exemplified in the slender mullions of\r\nUlm, the lofty and complicated spire of Strasburg, and the curious\r\ntraceries of churches and houses in Nuremberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PERIODS.+ The periods of German mediæval architecture corresponded in\r\nsequence, though not in date, with the movement elsewhere. The maturing\r\nof the true Gothic styles was preceded by more than a half-century of\r\ntransition. Chronologically the periods may be broadly stated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSITIONAL, 1170-1225.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY POINTED, 1225-1275.\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE OR DECORATED, 1275-1350.\r\n\r\nTHE FLORID, 1350-1530.\r\n\r\nThese divisions are, however, far less clearly defined than in France\r\nand England. The development of forms was less logical and\r\nconsequential, and less uniform in the different provinces, than in\r\nthose western lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CONSTRUCTION.+ As already remarked, a tenacious hold of Romanesque\r\nmethods is observable in many German Gothic monuments. Broad\r\nwall-surfaces with small windows and a general massiveness and lowness\r\nof proportions were long preferred to the more slender and lofty\r\nforms of true Gothic design. Square vaulting-bays were persistently\r\nadhered to, covering two aisle-bays. The six-part system was only\r\nrarely resorted to, as at Schlettstadt, and in St. George at\r\nLimburg-on-the-Lahn (Fig. 139). The ribbed vault was an imported idea,\r\nand was never systematically developed. Under the final dominance of\r\nFrench models in the second half of the thirteenth century, vaulting in\r\noblong bays became more general, powerfully influenced by buildings like\r\nFreiburg, Cologne, Oppenheim, and Ratisbon cathedrals. In the fourteenth\r\ncentury the growing taste for elaboration and rich detail led to the\r\nintroduction of multiplied decorative ribs. These, however, did not come\r\ninto use, as in England, through a logical development of constructive\r\nmethods, but purely as decorative features. The German multiple-ribbed\r\nvaulting is, therefore, less satisfying than the English, though often\r\nelegant. Conspicuous examples of its application are found in the\r\ncathedrals of Freiburg, Ulm, Prague, and Vienna; in St. Barbara at\r\nKuttenberg, and many other important churches. But with all the richness\r\nand complexity of these net-like vaults the Germans developed nothing\r\nlike the fan-vaulting or chapter-house ceilings of England.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 139.--ONE BAY OF CATHEDRAL OF ST. GEORGE,\r\n  LIMBURG.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+SIDE AISLES.+ The most notable structural innovation of the Germans was\r\nthe raising of the side aisles to the same height as the central aisle\r\nin a number of important churches. They thus created a distinctly new\r\ntype, to which German writers have given the name of _hall-church_. The\r\nresult of this innovation was to transform completely the internal\r\nperspective of the church, as well as its structural membering. The\r\nclearstory disappeared; the central aisle no longer dominated the\r\ninterior; the pier-arches and side-walls were greatly increased in\r\nheight, and flying buttresses were no longer required. The whole design\r\nappeared internally more spacious, but lost greatly in variety and in\r\ninterest. The cathedral of +St. Stephen+ at Vienna is the most imposing\r\ninstance of this treatment, which first appeared in the church of St.\r\nElizabeth at Marburg (1235-83; Fig. 140). St. Barbara at Kuttenberg, St.\r\nMartin’s at Landshut (1404), and the cathedral of Munich are others\r\namong many examples of this type.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 140.--SECTION OF ST. ELIZABETH, MARBURG.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+TOWERS AND SPIRES.+ The same fondness for spires which had been\r\ndisplayed in the Rhenish Romanesque churches produced in the Gothic\r\nperiod a number of strikingly beautiful church steeples, in which\r\nopenwork tracery was substituted for the solid stone pyramids of earlier\r\nexamples. The most remarkable of these spires are those of Freiburg\r\n(1300), Strasburg, and Cologne cathedrals, of the church at Esslingen,\r\nSt. Martin’s at Landshut, and the cathedral of Vienna. In these the\r\ntransition from the simple square tower below to the octagonal belfry\r\nand spire is generally managed with skill. In the remarkable tower of\r\nthe cathedral at Vienna (1433) the transition is too gradual, so that\r\nthe spire seems to start from the ground and lacks the vigor and accent\r\nof a simpler square lower portion. The over-elaborate spire of\r\n+Strasburg+ (1429, by Junckher of Cologne; lower parts and façade,\r\n1277-1365, by _Erwin von Steinbach_ and his sons) reaches a height of\r\n468 feet; the spires of Cologne, completed in 1883 from the original\r\nfourteenth-century drawings, long lost but recovered by a happy\r\naccident, are 500 feet high. The spires of +Ratisbon+ and +Ulm+\r\ncathedrals have also been recently completed in the original style.\r\n\r\n\r\n+DETAILS.+ German window tracery was best where it most closely followed\r\nFrench patterns, but it tended always towards the faults of mechanical\r\nstiffness and of technical display in over-slenderness of shafts and\r\nmullions. The windows, especially in the “hall-churches,” were apt to be\r\ntoo narrow for their height. In the fifteenth century ingenuity of\r\ngeometrical combinations took the place of grace of line, and later the\r\ntracery was often tortured into a stone caricature of rustic-work of\r\ninterlaced and twisted boughs and twigs, represented with all their bark\r\nand knots (_branch-tracery_). The execution was far superior to the\r\ndesign. The carving of foliage in capitals, finials, etc., calls for no\r\nspecial mention for its originality or its departure from French types.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PLANS.+ In these there was more variety than in any other part of\r\nEurope except Italy. Some churches, like Naumburg, retained the\r\nRomanesque system of a second western apse and short choir. The\r\nCistercian churches generally had square east ends, while the polygonal\r\neastern apse without ambulatory is seen in St. Elizabeth at Marburg, the\r\ncathedrals of Ratisbon, Ulm and Vienna, and many other churches. The\r\nintroduction of French ideas in the thirteenth century led to the\r\nadoption in a number of cases of the chevet with a single ambulatory and\r\na series of radiating apsidal chapels. +Magdeburg+ cathedral (1208-11)\r\nwas the first erected on this plan, which was later followed at\r\nAltenburg, Cologne, Freiburg, Lübeck, Prague and Zwettl, in St. Francis\r\nat Salzburg and some other churches. Side chapels to nave or choir\r\nappear in the cathedrals of Lübeck, Munich, Oppenheim, Prague and\r\nZwettl. +Cologne+ +Cathedral+, by far the largest and most magnificent\r\nof all, is completely French in plan, uniting in one design the leading\r\ncharacteristics of the most notable French churches (Fig. 141). It has\r\ncomplete double aisles in both nave and choir, three-aisled transepts,\r\nradial chevet-chapels and twin western towers. The ambulatory is,\r\nhowever, single, and there are no lateral chapels. A typical German\r\ntreatment was the eastward termination of the church by polygonal\r\nchapels, one in the axis of each aisle, the central one projecting\r\nbeyond its neighbors. Where there were five aisles, as at Xanten, the\r\neffect was particularly fine. The plan of the curious polygonal church\r\nof +Our Lady+ (Liebfrauenkirche; 1227-43) built on the site of the\r\nancient circular baptistery at Treves, would seem to have been produced\r\nby doubling such an arrangement on either side of the transverse axis\r\n(Fig. 142).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 141.--COLOGNE CATHEDRAL. PLAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 142.--CHURCH OF OUR LADY, TREVES.]\r\n\r\n+HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT.+ The so-called +Golden Portal+ of +Freiburg+ in\r\nthe Erzgebirge is perhaps the first distinctively Gothic work in\r\nGermany, dating from 1190. From that time on, Gothic details appeared\r\nwith increasing frequency, especially in the Rhine provinces, as shown\r\nin many transitional structures. +Gelnhausen+ and Aschaffenburg are\r\nearly 13th-century examples; pointed arches and vaults appear in the\r\nApostles’ and St. Martin’s churches at Cologne; and the great church of\r\n+St. Peter and St. Paul+ at Neuweiler in Alsace has an almost purely\r\nGothic nave of the same period. The churches of +Bamberg+, +Fritzlar+,\r\nand +Naumburg+, and in Westphalia those of +Münster+ and +Osnabrück+,\r\nare important examples of the transition. The French influence,\r\nespecially the Burgundian, appears as early as 1212 in the cathedral of\r\nMagdeburg, imitating the choir of Soissons, and in the structural design\r\nof the Liebfrauenkirche at Treves as already mentioned; it reached\r\ncomplete ascendancy in Alsace at +Strasburg+ (nave 1240-75), in Baden at\r\n+Freiburg+ (nave 1270) and in Prussia at +Cologne+ (1248-1320).\r\nStrasburg Cathedral is especially remarkable for its façade, the work of\r\nErwin von Steinbach and his sons (1277-1346), designed after French\r\nmodels, and its north spire, built in the fifteenth century. Cologne\r\nCathedral, begun in 1248 by _Gerhard of Riel_ in imitation of the newly\r\ncompleted choir of Amiens, was continued by Master _Arnold_ and his son\r\n_John_, and the choir was consecrated in 1322. The nave and W. front\r\nwere built during the first half of the 14th century, though the towers\r\nwere not completed till 1883. In spite of its vast size and slow\r\nconstruction, it is in style the most uniform of all great Gothic\r\ncathedrals, as it is the most lofty (excepting the choir of Beauvais)\r\nand the largest excepting Milan and Seville. Unfortunately its details,\r\nthough pure and correct, are singularly dry and mechanical, while its\r\nvery uniformity deprives it of the picturesque and varied charm which\r\nresults from a mixture of styles recording the labors of successive\r\ngenerations. The same criticism may be raised against the late cathedral\r\nof +Ulm+ (choir, 1377-1449; nave, 1477; Fig. 143). The Cologne influence\r\nis observable in the widely separated cathedrals of Utrecht in the\r\nNetherlands, Metz in the W., Minden and +Halberstadt+ (begun 1250;\r\nmainly built after 1327) in Saxony, and in the S. in the church of +St.\r\nCatherine+ at Oppenheim. To the E. and S., in the cathedrals of +Prague+\r\n(Bohemia) by _Matthew of Arras_ (1344-52) and +Ratisbon+ (or Regensburg,\r\n1275) the French influence predominates, at least in the details and\r\nconstruction. The last-named is one of the most dignified and beautiful\r\nof German Gothic churches--German in plan, French in execution. The\r\nFrench influence also manifests itself in the details of many of the\r\npeculiarly German churches with aisles of equal height (see p. 240).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 143.--PLAN OF ULM CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nMore peculiarly German are the brick churches of North Germany, where\r\nstone was almost wholly lacking. In these, flat walls, square towers,\r\nand decoration by colored tiles and bricks are characteristic, as at\r\nBrandenburg (St. Godehard and +St. Catherine+, 1346-1400), at\r\n+Prentzlau+, Tängermünde, Königsberg, &c. Lübeck possesses notable\r\nmonuments of brick architecture in the churches of +St. Mary+ and St.\r\nCatherine, both much alike in plan and in the flat and barren simplicity\r\nof their exteriors. +St. Martin’s+ at +Landshut+ in the South is also a\r\nnotable brick church.\r\n\r\n\r\n+LATE GOTHIC.+ As in France and England, the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies were mainly occupied with the completion of existing churches,\r\nmany of which, up to that time, were still without naves. The works of\r\nthis period show the exaggerated attenuation of detail already alluded\r\nto, though their richness and elegance sometimes atone for their\r\nmechanical character. The complicated ribbed vaults of this period are\r\namong its most striking features (see p. 239). Spire-building was as\r\ngeneral as was the erection of central square towers in England, during\r\nthe same period. To this time also belong the overloaded traceries and\r\nminute detail of the +St. Sebald+ and St. Lorenz churches and of several\r\nsecular buildings at Nuremberg, the façade of Chemnitz Cathedral, and\r\nsimilar works. The nave and tower of St. Stephen at Vienna (1359-1433),\r\nthe church of Sta. Maria in Gestade in the same city, and the cathedral\r\nof Kaschau in Hungary, are Austrian masterpieces of late Gothic design.\r\n\r\n\r\n+SECULAR BUILDINGS.+ Germany possesses a number of important examples of\r\nsecular Gothic work, chiefly municipal buildings (gates and town halls)\r\nand castles. The first completely Gothic castle or palace was not built\r\nuntil 1280, at +Marienburg+ (Prussia), and was completed a century\r\nlater. It consists of two courts, the earlier of the two forming a\r\nclosed square and containing the chapel and chapter-house of the Order\r\nof the German knights. The later and larger court is less regular, its\r\nchief feature being the +Great Hall+ of the Order, in two aisles. All\r\nthe vaulting is of the richest multiple-ribbed type. Other castles are\r\nat Marienwerder, Heilsberg (1350) in E. Prussia, Karlstein in Bohemia\r\n(1347), and the +Albrechtsburg+ at Meissen in Saxony (1471-83).\r\n\r\nAmong town halls, most of which date from the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies may be mentioned those of Ratisbon (Regensburg), Münster and\r\nHildesheim, Halberstadt, +Brunswick+, Lübeck, and Bremen--the last two\r\nof brick. These, and the city gates, such as the +Spahlenthor+ at Basle\r\n(Switzerland) and others at Lübeck and Wismar, are generally very\r\npicturesque edifices. Many fine guildhalls were also built during the\r\nlast two centuries of the Gothic style; and dwelling-houses of the same\r\nperiod, of quaint and effective design, with stepped or traceried\r\ngables, lofty roofs, openwork balconies and corner turrets, are to be\r\nfound in many cities. Nuremberg is especially rich in these.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE NETHERLANDS+, as might be expected from their position, underwent\r\nthe influences of both France and Germany. During the thirteenth\r\ncentury, largely through the intimate monastic relations between Tournay\r\nand Noyon, the French influence became paramount in what is now Belgium,\r\nwhile Holland remained more strongly German in style. Of the two\r\ncountries Belgium developed by far the most interesting architecture.\r\nSome of its cathedrals, notably those of Tournay, Antwerp, Brussels,\r\nMalines (Mechlin), Mons and Louvain, rank high among structures of their\r\nclass, both in scale and in artistic treatment. The Flemish town halls\r\nand guildhalls merit particular attention for their size and richness,\r\nexemplifying in a worthy manner the wealth, prosperity, and independence\r\nof the weavers and merchants of Antwerp, Ypres, Ghent (Gand), Louvain,\r\nand other cities in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CATHEDRALS AND CHURCHES.+ The earliest purely Gothic edifice in Belgium\r\nwas the choir of +Ste. Gudule+ (1225) at Brussels, followed in 1242 by\r\nthe choir and transepts of +Tournay+, designed with pointed vaults, side\r\nchapels, and a complete _chevet_. The transept-ends are round, as at\r\nNoyon. It was surpassed in splendor by the +Cathedral+ of +Antwerp+\r\n(1352-1422), remarkable for its seven-aisled nave and narrow transepts.\r\nIt covers some 70,000 square feet, but its great size is not as\r\neffective internally as it should be, owing to the poverty of the\r\ndetails and the lack of finely felt proportion in the various parts. The\r\nlate west front (1422-1518) displays the florid taste of the wealthy\r\nFlemish burgher population of that period, but is so rich and elegant,\r\nespecially its lofty and slender north spire, that its over-decoration\r\nis pardonable. The cathedral of +St. Rombaut+ at Malines (choir, 1366;\r\nnave, 1454-64) is a more satisfactory church, though smaller and with\r\nits western towers incomplete. The cathedral of +Louvain+ belongs to the\r\nsame period (1373-1433). +St. Wandru+ at Mons (1450-1528) and +St.\r\nJacques+ at Liège (1522-58) are interesting parish churches of the first\r\nrank, remarkable especially for the use of color in their internal\r\ndecoration, for their late tracery and ribbed vaulting, and for the\r\nabsence of Renaissance details at that late period.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 144.--TOWN HALL, LOUVAIN.]\r\n\r\n+TOWN HALLS: GUILDHALLS.+ These were really the most characteristic\r\nFlemish edifices, and are in most cases the most conspicuous monuments\r\nof their respective cities. The +Cloth Hall+ of +Ypres+ (1304) is the\r\nearliest and most imposing among them; similar halls were built not much\r\nlater at +Bruges+, +Louvain+, +Malines+ and +Ghent+. The town halls were\r\nmostly of later date, the earliest being that of +Bruges+ (1377). The\r\ntown halls of +Brussels+ with its imposing and graceful tower, of\r\n+Louvain+ (1448-63; Fig. 144) and of +Oudenärde+ (early 16th century)\r\nare conspicuous monuments of this class.\r\n\r\nIn general, the Gothic architecture of Belgium presents the traits of a\r\nborrowed style, which did not undergo at the hands of its borrowers any\r\nradically novel or fundamental development. The structural design is\r\nusually lacking in vigor and organic significance, but the details are\r\noften graceful and well designed, especially on the exterior. The\r\ntendency was often towards over-elaboration, particularly in the later\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic architecture of +Holland+ and of the +Scandinavian+ countries\r\noffers so little that is highly artistic or inspiring in character, that\r\nspace cannot well be given in this work, even to an enumeration of its\r\nchief monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n+SPAIN AND PORTUGAL.+ The beginnings of Gothic architecture in Spain\r\nfollowed close on the series of campaigns from 1217 to 1252, which began\r\nthe overthrow of the Moorish dominion. With the resulting spirit of\r\nexultation and the wealth accruing from booty, came a rapid development\r\nof architecture, mainly under French influence. Gothic architecture was\r\nat this date, under St. Louis, producing in France some of its noblest\r\nworks. The great cathedrals of +Toledo+ and +Burgos+, begun between 1220\r\nand 1230, were the earliest purely Gothic churches in Spain. +San\r\nVincente+ at Avila and the +Old Cathedral+ at Salamanca, of somewhat\r\nearlier date, present a mixture of round- and pointed-arched forms, with\r\nthe Romanesque elements predominant. +Toledo Cathedral+, planned in\r\nimitation of Notre Dame and Bourges, but exceeding them in width, covers\r\n75,000 square feet, and thus ranks among the largest of European\r\ncathedrals. Internally it is well proportioned and well detailed,\r\nrecalling the early French masterworks, but its exterior is less\r\ncommendable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 145.--FAÇADE OF BURGOS CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nIn the contemporary cathedral of Burgos the exterior is at least as\r\ninteresting as the interior. The west front, of German design, suggests\r\nCologne by its twin openwork spires (Fig. 145); while the crossing is\r\nembellished with a sumptuous dome and lantern or _cimborio_, added as\r\nlate as 1567. The chapels at the east end, especially that of the\r\nCondestabile (1487), are ornate to the point of overloading, a fault to\r\nwhich late Spanish Gothic work is peculiarly prone. Other\r\nthirteenth-century cathedrals are those of +Leon+ (1260), +Valencia+\r\n(1262), and +Barcelona+ (1298), all exhibiting strongly the French\r\ninfluence in the plan, vaulting, and vertical proportions. The models of\r\nBourges and Paris with their wide naves, lateral chapels and\r\nsemicircular chevets were followed in the cathedral of Barcelona, in a\r\nnumber of fourteenth-century churches both there and elsewhere, and in\r\nthe sixteenth-century cathedral of Segovia. In Sta. Maria del Pi at\r\nBarcelona, in the collegiate church at Manresa, and in the imposing nave\r\nof the +Cathedral+ of +Gerona+ (1416, added to choir of 1312, the latter\r\nby a Southern French architect, Henri de Narbonne), the influence of\r\nAlby in southern France (see p. 206) is discernible. These are\r\none-aisled churches with internal buttresses separating the lateral\r\nchapels. The nave of Gerona is 73 feet wide, or double the average clear\r\nwidth of French or English cathedral naves. The resulting effect is not\r\ncommensurate with the actual dimensions, and shows the inappropriateness\r\nof Gothic details for compositions so Roman in breadth and simplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n+SEVILLE.+ The largest single edifice in Spain, and the largest church\r\nbuilt during the Middle Ages in Europe, is the +Cathedral of Seville+,\r\nbegun in 1401 on the site of a Moorish mosque. It covers 124,000 square\r\nfeet, measuring 415 × 298 feet, and is a simple rectangle comprising\r\nfive aisles with lateral chapels. The central aisle is 56 ft. wide and\r\n145 high; the side aisles and chapels diminish gradually in height, and\r\nwith the uniform piers in six rows produce an imposing effect, in spite\r\nof the lack of transepts or chevet. The somewhat similar +New Cathedral+\r\nof Salamanca (1510-1560) shows the last struggles of the Gothic style\r\nagainst the incoming tide of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\n\r\n+LATER MONUMENTS.+ These all partake of the over-decoration which\r\ncharacterized the fifteenth century throughout Europe. In Spain this\r\ndecoration was even less constructive in character, and more purely\r\nfanciful and arbitrary, than in the northern lands; but this very\r\nrejection of all constructive pretense gives it a peculiar charm and\r\ngoes far to excuse its extravagance (Fig. 146). Decorative vaulting-ribs\r\nwere made to describe geometric patterns of great elegance. Some of the\r\nlate Gothic vaults by the very exuberance of imagination shown in their\r\ndesigns, almost disarm criticism. Instead of suppressing the walls as\r\nfar as possible, and emphasizing all the vertical lines, as was done in\r\nFrance and England, the later Gothic architects of Spain delighted in\r\nbroad wall-surfaces and multiplied horizontal lines. Upon these surfaces\r\nthey lavished carving without restraint and without any organic relation\r\nto the structure of the building. The arcades of cloisters and interior\r\ncourts (_patios_) were formed with arches of fantastic curves resting on\r\ntwisted columns; and internal chapels in the cathedrals were covered\r\nwith minute carving of exquisite workmanship, but wholly irrational\r\ndesign. Probably the influence of Moorish decorative art accounts in\r\npart for these extravagances. The eastern chapels in Burgos cathedral,\r\nthe votive church of +San Juan de los Reyes+ at Toledo and many portals\r\nof churches, convents and hospitals illustrate these tendencies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 146.--DETAIL, PORTAL S. GREGORIO, VALLADOLID.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+PORTUGAL+ is an almost unknown land architecturally. It seems to have\r\nadopted the Gothic styles very late in its history. Two monuments,\r\nhowever, are conspicuous, the convent churches of Batalha (1390-1520)\r\nand +Belem+, both marked by an extreme overloading of carved ornament.\r\nThe +Mausoleum of King Manoel+ in the rear of the church at Batalha is,\r\nhowever, a noble creation, possibly by an English master.

Street, _Brick and Marble\r\n  Architecture of Italy_. Willis, _Remarks on the Architecture of\r\n  the Middle Ages, especially of Italy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+GENERAL CHARACTER.+ The various Romanesque styles which had grown up in\r\nItaly before 1200 lacked that unity of principle out of which alone a\r\nnew and homogeneous national style could have been evolved. Each\r\nprovince practised its own style and methods of building, long after the\r\nRomanesque had given place to the Gothic in Western Europe. The Italians\r\nwere better decorators than builders, and cared little for Gothic\r\nstructural principles. Mosaic and carving, sumptuous altars and tombs,\r\nveneerings and inlays of colored marble, broad flat surfaces to be\r\ncovered with painting and ornament--to secure these they were content to\r\nbuild crudely, to tie their insufficiently buttressed vaults with\r\nunsightly iron tie-rods, and to make their church façades mere\r\nscreen-walls, in form wholly unrelated to the buildings behind them.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, under foreign influences pointed arches, tracery,\r\nclustered shafts, crockets and finials came into use, it was merely as\r\nan imported fashion. Even when foreign architects (usually Germans) were\r\nemployed, the composition, and in large measure the details, were still\r\nItalian and provincial. The church of St. Francis at Assisi (1228-53, by\r\n_Jacobus of Meruan_, a German, superseded later by an Italian,\r\nCampello), and the cathedral of Milan (begun 1389, perhaps by _Henry of\r\nGmund_), are conspicuous illustrations of this. Rome built basilicas all\r\nthrough the Middle Ages. Tuscany continued to prefer flat walls veneered\r\nwith marble to the broken surfaces and deep buttresses of France and\r\nGermany. Venice developed a Gothic style of façade-design wholly her own\r\n(see p. 267). Nowhere but in Italy could two such utterly diverse\r\nstructures as the Certosa at Pavia and the cathedral at Milan have been\r\nerected at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CLIMATE AND TRADITION.+ Two further causes militated against the\r\ndomestication of Gothic art in Italy. The first was the brilliant\r\natmosphere, which made the vast traceried windows of Gothic design, and\r\nits suppression of the wall-surfaces, wholly undesirable. Cool, dim\r\ninteriors, thick walls, small windows and the exclusion of sunlight, all\r\nnecessary to Italian comfort, were incompatible with Gothic ideals and\r\nmethods. The second obstacle was the persistence of classic traditions\r\nof form, both in construction and decoration. The spaciousness and\r\nbreadth of interior planning which characterized Roman design, and its\r\namplitude of scale in every feature, seem never to have lost their hold\r\non the Italians. The narrow lofty aisles, multiplied supports and minute\r\ndetail of the Gothic style were repugnant to the classic predilections\r\nof the Italian builders. The Roman acanthus and Corinthian capital were\r\nconstantly imitated in their Gothic buildings, and the round arch\r\ncontinued all through the Middle Ages to be used in conjunction with the\r\npointed arch (Figs. 149, 150).\r\n\r\n\r\n+EARLY BUILDINGS.+ It is hard to determine how and by whom Gothic forms\r\nwere first introduced into Italy, but it was most probably through the\r\nagency of the monastic orders. Cistercian churches like that at\r\nChiaravalle near Milan (1208-21), and most of those erected by the\r\nmendicant orders of the Franciscans (founded 1210) and Dominicans\r\n(1216), were built with ribbed vaults and pointed arches. The example\r\nset by these orders contributed greatly to the general adoption of the\r\nforeign style. +S. Francesco+ at +Assisi+, already mentioned, was the\r\nfirst completely Gothic Franciscan church, although +S. Francesco+ at\r\n+Bologna+, begun a few years later, was finished a little earlier. The\r\nDominican church of +SS. Giovanni e Paolo+ and the great Franciscan\r\nchurch of +Sta. Maria Gloriosa dei Frari+, both at Venice, were built a\r\nlittle later. +Sta. Maria Novella+ at Florence (1278), and +Sta. Maria\r\nsopra Minerva+ at Rome (1280), both by the brothers _Sisto_ and\r\n_Ristoro_, and +S. Anastasia+ at Verona (1261) are the masterpieces of\r\nthe Dominican builders. +S. Andrea+ at +Vercelli+ in North Italy, begun\r\nin 1219 under a foreign architect, is an isolated early example of lay\r\nGothic work. Though somewhat English in its plan, and (unlike most\r\nItalian churches) provided with two western spires in the English\r\nmanner, it is in all other respects thoroughly Italian in aspect. The\r\nchurch at Asti, begun in 1229, suggests German models by its high side\r\nwalls and narrow windows.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 147.--DUOMO AT FLORENCE. PLAN.\r\n  a, _Campanile_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+CATHEDRALS.+ The greatest monuments of Italian Gothic design are the\r\ncathedrals, in which, even more than was the case in France, the highly\r\ndeveloped civic pride of the municipalities expressed itself. Chief\r\namong these half civic, half religious monuments are the cathedrals of\r\n+Sienna+ (begun in 1243), +Arezzo+ (1278), +Orvieto+ (1290), +Florence+\r\n(the +Duomo+, Sta. Maria del Fiore, begun 1294 by Arnolfo di Cambio),\r\n+Lucca+ (S. Martino, 1350), +Milan+ (1389-1418), and +S. Petronio+ at\r\nBologna (1390). They are all of imposing size; Milan is the largest of\r\nall Gothic cathedrals except Seville. S. Petronio was planned to be 600\r\nfeet long, the present structure with its three broad aisles and\r\nflanking chapels being merely the nave of the intended edifice. The\r\nDuomo at Florence (Fig. 147) is 500 feet long and covers 82,000 square\r\nfeet, while the octagon at the crossing is 143 feet in diameter. The\r\neffect of these colossal dimensions is, however, as in a number of these\r\nlarge Italian interiors, singularly belittled by the bareness of the\r\nwalls, by the great size of the constituent parts of the composition,\r\nand by the lack of architectural subdivisions and multiplied detail to\r\nserve as a scale by which to gauge the scale of the _ensemble_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 148.--NAVE OF DUOMO AT FLORENCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+INTERIOR TREATMENT.+ It was doubtless intended to cover these large\r\nunbroken wall-surfaces and the vast expanse of the vaults over naves of\r\nextraordinary breadth, with paintings and color decoration. This would\r\nhave remedied their present nakedness and lack of interest, but it was\r\nonly in a very few instances carried out. The double church of\r\nS. Francesco at Assisi, decorated by Cimabue, Giotto, and other early\r\nTuscan painters, the Arena Chapel at Padua, painted by Giotto, the\r\n+Spanish Chapel+ of S. M. Novella, Florence, and the east end of\r\nS. Croce, Florence, are illustrations of the splendor of effect possible\r\nby this method of decoration. The bareness of effect in other, unpainted\r\ninteriors was emphasized by the plainness of the vaults destitute of\r\nminor ribs. The transverse ribs were usually broad arches with flat\r\nsoffits, and the vaulting was often sprung from so low a point as to\r\nleave no room for a triforium. Mere bull’s-eyes often served for\r\nclearstory windows, as in S. Anastasia at Verona, S. Petronio at\r\nBologna, and the Florentine Duomo. The cathedral of +S. Martino+ at\r\nLucca (Fig. 149) is one of the most complete and elegant of Italian\r\nGothic interiors, having a genuine triforium with traceried arches. Even\r\nhere, however, there are round arches without mouldings, flat pilasters,\r\nbroad transverse ribs recalling Roman arches, and insignificant\r\nbull’s-eyes in the clearstory.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 149.--ONE BAY, NAVE OF CATHEDRAL OF\r\n  SAN MARTINO, LUCCA.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 150.--INTERIOR OF SIENNA CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nThe failure to produce adequate results of scale in the interiors of the\r\nlarger Italian churches, has been already alluded to. It is strikingly\r\nexemplified in the Duomo at Florence, the nave of which is 72 feet wide,\r\nwith four pier-arches each over 55 feet in span. The immense vault, in\r\nsquare bays, starts from the level of the tops of these arches. The\r\ninterior (Fig. 148) is singularly naked and cold, giving no conception\r\nof its vast dimensions. The colossal dome is an early work of the\r\nRenaissance (see p. 276). It is not known how _Fr. Talenti_, who in 1357\r\nenlarged and vaulted the nave and planned the east end, proposed to\r\ncover the great octagon. The east end is the most effective part of the\r\ndesign both internally and externally, owing to the relatively moderate\r\nscale of the 15 chapels which surround the apsidal arms of the cross. In\r\nS. Petronio at Bologna, begun 1390 by _Master Antonio_, the scale is\r\nbetter handled. The nave, 300 feet long, is divided into six bays, each\r\nembracing two side chapels. It is 46 feet wide and 132 feet high,\r\nproportions which approximate those of the French cathedrals, and\r\nproduce an impression of size somewhat unusual in Italian churches.\r\n+Orvieto+ has internally little that suggests Gothic architecture; like\r\nmany Franciscan and Dominican churches it is really a timber-roofed\r\nbasilica with a few pointed windows. The mixed Gothic and Romanesque\r\ninterior of +Sienna Cathedral+ (Fig. 150), with its round arches and\r\nsix-sided dome, unsymmetrically placed over the crossing, is one of the\r\nmost impressive creations of Italian mediæval art. Alternate courses of\r\nblack and white marble add richness but not repose to the effect of this\r\ninterior: the same is true of Orvieto, and of some other churches. The\r\nbasement baptistery of +S. Giovanni+, under the east end of Sienna\r\nCathedral, is much more purely Gothic in detail.\r\n\r\nIn these, and indeed in most Italian interiors, the main interest\r\ncentres less in the excellence of the composition than in the\r\naccessories of pavements, pulpits, choir-stalls, and sepulchral\r\nmonuments. In these the decorative fancy and skill of the Italians found\r\nunrestrained exercise, and produced works of surpassing interest and\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\n\r\n+EXTERNAL DESIGN.+ The greatest possible disparity generally exists\r\nbetween the sides and west fronts of the Italian churches. With few\r\nexceptions the flanks present nothing like the variety of sky-line and\r\nof light and shade customary in northern and western lands. The side\r\nwalls are high and flat, plain, or striped with black and white masonry\r\n(Sienna, Orvieto), or veneered with marble (Duomo at Florence) or\r\ndecorated with surface-ornament of thin pilasters and arcades (Lucca).\r\nThe clearstory is low; the roof low--pitched and hardly visible from\r\nbelow. Color, rather than structural richness, is generally sought for:\r\nMilan Cathedral is almost the only exception, and goes to the other\r\nextreme, with its seemingly countless buttresses, pinnacles and statues.\r\n\r\nThe façades, on the other hand, were treated as independent decorative\r\ncompositions, and were in many cases remarkably beautiful works, though\r\nhaving little or no organic relation to the main structure. The most\r\ncelebrated are those of +Sienna+ (cathedral begun 1243; façade 1284 by\r\n_Giovanni Pisano_; Fig. 151) and +Orvieto+ (begun 1290 by _Lorenzo\r\nMaitani_; façade 1310). Both of these are sumptuous polychromatic\r\ncompositions in marble, designed on somewhat similar lines, with three\r\nhigh gables fronting the three aisles, with deeply recessed portals,\r\npinnacled turrets flanking nave and aisles, and a central circular\r\nwindow. That of Orvieto is furthermore embellished with mosaic pictures,\r\nand is the more brilliant in color of the two. The mediæval façades of\r\nthe Florentine Gothic churches were never completed; but the elegance of\r\nthe panelling and of the tracery with twisted shafts in the flanks of\r\nthe cathedral, and the florid beauty of its side doorways (late 14th\r\ncentury) would doubtless if realized with equal success on the façades,\r\nhave produced strikingly beautiful results. The modern façade of the\r\nDuomo, by the late _De Fabris_ (1887) is a correct if not highly\r\nimaginative version of the style so applied. The front of Milan\r\ncathedral (soon to be replaced by a new façade), shows a mixture of\r\nGothic and Renaissance forms. +Ferrara Cathedral+, although internally\r\ntransformed in the last century, retains its fine 13th-century\r\nthree-gabled and arcaded screen front; one of the most Gothic in spirit\r\nof all Italian façades. The +Cathedral+ of +Genoa+ presents Gothic\r\nwindows and deeply recessed portals in a façade built in black and white\r\nbands, like Sienna cathedral and many churches in Pistoia and Pisa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 151.--FAÇADE OF SIENNA CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nExternally the most important feature was frequently a cupola or dome\r\nover the crossing. That of Sienna has already been mentioned; that of\r\nMilan is a sumptuous many-pinnacled structure terminating in a spire 300\r\nfeet high. The +Certosa+ at Pavia (Fig. 152) and the earlier Carthusian\r\nchurch of Chiaravalle have internal cupolas or domes covered externally\r\nby many-storied structures ending in a tower dominating the whole\r\nedifice. These two churches, like many others in Lombardy, the Æmilia\r\nand Venetia, are built of brick, moulded terra-cotta being effectively\r\nused for the cornices, string-courses, jambs and ornaments of the\r\nexterior. The Certosa at Pavia is contemporary with the cathedral of\r\nMilan, to which it offers a surprising contrast, both in style and\r\nmaterial. It is wholly built of brick and terra-cotta, and, save for its\r\nribbed vaulting, possesses hardly a single Gothic feature or detail. Its\r\narches, mouldings, and cloisters suggest both the Romanesque and the\r\nRenaissance styles by their semi-classic character.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 152.--EXTERIOR OF THE CERTOSA, PAVIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+PLANS.+ The wide diversity of local styles in Italian architecture\r\nappears in the plans as strikingly as in the details In general one\r\nnotes a love of spaciousness which expresses itself in a sometimes\r\ndisproportionate breadth, and in the wide spacing of the piers. The\r\npolygonal chevet with its radial chapels is but rarely seen;\r\n+S. Lorenzo+ at Naples, Sta. Maria dei Servi and S. Francesco at Bologna\r\nare among the most important examples. More frequently the chapels form\r\na range along the east side of the transepts, especially in the\r\nFranciscan churches, which otherwise retain many basilican features.\r\nA comparison of the plans of S. Andrea at Vercelli, the Duomo at\r\nFlorence, the cathedrals of Sienna and Milan, S. Petronio at Bologna and\r\nthe Certosa at Pavia (Fig. 153), sufficiently illustrates the variety of\r\nItalian Gothic plan-types.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 153.--PLAN OF CERTOSA AT PAVIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+ORNAMENT.+ Applied decoration plays a large part in all Italian Gothic\r\ndesigns. Inlaid and mosaic patterns and panelled veneering in colored\r\nmarble are essential features of the exterior decoration of most Italian\r\nchurches. Florence offers a fine example of this treatment in the Duomo,\r\nand in its accompanying +Campanile+ or bell-tower, designed by _Giotto_\r\n(1335), and completed by _Gaddi_ and _Talenti_. This beautiful tower is\r\nan epitome of Italian Gothic art. Its inlays, mosaics, and veneering are\r\ntreated with consummate elegance, and combined with incrusted reliefs of\r\ngreat beauty. The tracery of this monument and of the side windows of\r\nthe adjoining cathedral is lighter and more graceful than is common in\r\nItaly. Its beauty consists, however, less in movement of line than in\r\nrichness and elegance of carved and inlaid ornament. In the +Or San\r\nMichele+--a combined chapel and granary in Florence dating from\r\n1330--the tracery is far less light and open. In general, except in\r\nchurches like the Cathedral of Milan, built under German influences, the\r\ntracery in secular monuments is more successful than in ecclesiastical\r\nstructures. Venice developed the designing of tracery to greater\r\nperfection in her palaces than any other Italian city (see below).\r\n\r\n\r\n+MINOR WORKS.+ Italian Gothic art found freer expression in\r\nsemi-decorative works, like tombs, altars and votive chapels, than in\r\nmore monumental structures. The fourteenth century was particularly rich\r\nin canopy tombs, mostly in churches, though some were erected in the\r\nopen air, like the celebrated +Tombs of the Scaligers+ in Verona\r\n(1329-1380). Many of those in churches in and near Rome, and others in\r\nsouth Italy, are especially rich in inlay of _opus Alexandrinum_ upon\r\ntheir twisted columns and panelled sarcophagi. The family of the\r\n_Cosmati_ acquired great fame for work of this kind during the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe little marble chapel of +Sta. Maria della Spina+, on the Arno, at\r\nPisa, is an instance of the successful decorative use of Gothic forms in\r\nminor buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n+TOWERS.+ The Italians always preferred the square tower to the spire,\r\nand in most cases treated it as an independent campanile. Following\r\nEarly Christian and Romanesque traditions, these square towers were\r\nusually built with plain sides unbroken by buttresses, and terminated in\r\na flat roof or a low and inconspicuous cone or pyramid. The Campanile at\r\nFlorence already mentioned is by far the most beautiful of these designs\r\n(Fig. 154). The campaniles of Sienna, Lucca, and Pistoia are built in\r\nalternate white and black courses, like the adjoining cathedrals. Verona\r\nand Mantua have towers with octagonal lanterns. In general, these Gothic\r\ntowers differ from the earlier Romanesque models only in the forms of\r\ntheir openings. Though dignified in their simplicity and size, and\r\nusually well proportioned, they lack the beauty and interest of the\r\nFrench, English, and German steeples and towers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 154.--UPPER PART OF CAMPANILE, FLORENCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+SECULAR MONUMENTS.+ In their public halls, open _loggias_, and domestic\r\narchitecture the Italians were able to develop the application of Gothic\r\nforms with greater freedom than in their church-building, because\r\nunfettered by traditional methods of design. The early and vigorous\r\ngrowth of municipal and popular institutions led, as in the Netherlands,\r\nto the building of two classes of public halls--the town hall proper or\r\n_Podestà_, and the council hall, variously called _Palazzo Communale_,\r\n_Pubblico_, or _del Consiglio_. The town halls, as the seat of\r\nauthority, usually have a severe and fortress-like character; the\r\n+Palazzo Vecchio+ at Florence is the most important example (1298, by\r\nArnolfo di Cambio; Fig. 155). It is especially remarkable for its tower,\r\nwhich, rising 308 feet in the air, overhangs the street nearly 6 feet,\r\nits front wall resting on the face of the powerfully corbelled cornice\r\nof the palace. The court and most of the interior were remodelled in the\r\nsixteenth century. At Sienna is a somewhat similar structure in brick,\r\nthe +Palazzo Pubblico+. At Pistoia the Podestà and the Communal Palace\r\nstand opposite each other; in both of these the courtyards still retain\r\ntheir original aspect. At Perugia, Bologna, and Viterbo are others of\r\nsome importance; while in Lombardy, Bergamo, Como, Cremona, Piacenza and\r\nother towns possess smaller halls with open arcades below, of a more\r\nelegant and pleasing aspect. More successful still are the open loggias\r\nor tribunes erected for the gatherings of public bodies. The +Loggia dei\r\nLanzi+ at Florence (1376, by _Benci di Cione_ and _Simone di Talenti_)\r\nis the largest and most famous of these open vaulted halls, of which\r\nseveral exist in Florence and Sienna. Gothic only in their minor\r\ndetails, they are Romanesque or semi-classic in their broad round arches\r\nand strong horizontal lines and cornices (Fig. 156).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 155.--UPPER PART OF PALAZZO VECCHIO,\r\n  FLORENCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+PALACES AND HOUSES: VENICE.+ The northern cities, especially Pisa,\r\nFlorence, Sienna, Bologna, and Venice, are rich in mediæval public and\r\nprivate palaces and dwellings in brick or marble, in which pointed\r\nwindows and open arcades are used with excellent effect. In Bologna and\r\nSienna brick is used, in conjunction with details executed in moulded\r\nterra-cotta, in a highly artistic and effective way. Viterbo, nearer\r\nRome, also possesses many interesting houses with street arcades and\r\nopen stairways or stoops leading to the main entrance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 156.--LOGGIA DEI LANZI, FLORENCE.]\r\n\r\nThe security and prosperity of Venice in the Middle Ages, and the ever\r\npresent influence of the sun-loving East, made the massive and\r\nfortress-like architecture of the inland cities unnecessary. Abundant\r\nopenings, large windows full of tracery of great lightness and elegance,\r\nprojecting balconies and the freest use of marble veneering and\r\ninlay--a survival of Byzantine traditions of the 12th century (see\r\np. 133)--give to the Venetian houses and palaces an air of gayety and\r\nelegance found nowhere else. While there are few Gothic churches of\r\nimportance in Venice, the number of mediæval houses and palaces is very\r\nlarge. Chief among these is the +Doge’s Palace+ (Fig. 157), adjoining\r\nthe church of St. Mark. The two-storied arcades of the west and south\r\nfronts date from 1354, and originally stood out from the main edifice,\r\nwhich was widened in the next century, when the present somewhat heavy\r\nwalls, laid up in red, white and black marble in a species of\r\nquarry-pattern, were built over the arcades. These arcades are beautiful\r\ndesigns, combining massive strength and grace in a manner quite foreign\r\nto Western Gothic ideas. Lighter and more ornate is the +Ca d’Oro+, on\r\nthe Grand Canal; while the Foscari, Contarini-Fasan, Cavalli, and Pisani\r\npalaces, among many others, are admirable examples of the style. In most\r\nof these a traceried loggia occupies the central part, flanked by walls\r\nincrusted with marble and pierced by Gothic windows with carved\r\nmouldings, borders, and balconies. The Venetian Gothic owes its success\r\nlargely to the absence of structural difficulties to interfere with the\r\npurely decorative development of Gothic details.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 157.--WEST FRONT VIEW OF DOGE’S PALACE,\r\n  VENICE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS.+ 13th Century: Cistercian abbeys Fossanova and\r\n  Casamari, _cir._ 1208; S. Andrea, Vercelli, 1209; S. Francesco,\r\n  Assisi, 1228-53; Church at Asti, 1229; Sienna C., 1243-59 (cupola\r\n  1259-64; façade 1284); S. M.

The Renaissance\r\nwas the result of a profound and universal intellectual movement, whose\r\nroots may be traced far back into the Middle Ages, and which manifested\r\nitself first in Italy simply because there the conditions were most\r\npropitious. It spread through Europe just as rapidly as similar\r\nconditions appearing in other countries prepared the way for it.\r\nThe essence of this far-reaching movement was the protest of the\r\nindividual reason against the trammels of external and arbitrary\r\nauthority--a protest which found its earliest organized expression in\r\nthe Humanists. In its assertion of the intellectual and moral rights\r\nof the individual, the Renaissance laid the foundations of modern\r\ncivilization. The same spirit, in rejecting the authority and teachings\r\nof the Church in matters of purely secular knowledge, led to the\r\nquestionings of the precursors of modern science and the discoveries of\r\nthe early navigators. But in nothing did the reaction against mediæval\r\nscholasticism and asceticism display itself more strikingly than in the\r\njoyful enthusiasm which marked the pursuit of classic studies. The\r\nlong-neglected treasures of classic literature were reopened, almost\r\nrediscovered, in the fourteenth century by the immortal trio--Dante,\r\nPetrarch, and Boccaccio. The joy of living, the hitherto forbidden\r\ndelight in beauty and pleasure for their own sakes, the exultant\r\nawakening to the sense of personal freedom, which came with the bursting\r\nof mediæval fetters, found in classic art and literature their most\r\nsympathetic expression. It was in Italy, where feudalism had never fully\r\nestablished itself, and where the municipalities and guilds had\r\ndeveloped, as nowhere else, the sense of civic and personal freedom,\r\nthat these symptoms first manifested themselves. In Italy, and above all\r\nin the Tuscan cities, they appeared throughout the fourteenth century in\r\nthe growing enthusiasm for all that recalled the antique culture, and in\r\nthe rapid advance of luxury and refinement in both public and private\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE RENAISSANCE OF THE ARTS.+ Classic Roman architecture had never lost\r\nits influence on the Italian taste. Gothic art, already declining in the\r\nWest, had never been in Italy more than a borrowed garb, clothing\r\narchitectural conceptions classic rather than Gothic in spirit. The\r\nantique monuments which abounded on every hand were ever present models\r\nfor the artist, and to the Florentines of the early fifteenth century\r\nthe civilization which had created them represented the highest ideal of\r\nhuman culture. They longed to revive in their own time the glories of\r\nancient Rome, and appropriated with uncritical and undiscriminating\r\nenthusiasm the good and the bad, the early and the late forms of Roman\r\nart, Naïvely unconscious of the disparity between their own\r\narchitectural conceptions and those they fancied they imitated, they\r\nwere, unknown to themselves, creating a new style, in which the details\r\nof Roman art were fitted in novel combinations to new requirements. In\r\nproportion as the Church lost its hold on the culture of the age, this\r\nnew architecture entered increasingly into the service of private luxury\r\nand public display. It created, it is true, striking types of church\r\ndesign, and made of the dome one of the most imposing of external\r\nfeatures; but its most characteristic products were palaces, villas,\r\ncouncil halls, and monuments to the great and the powerful. The personal\r\nelement in design asserted itself as never before in the growth of\r\nschools and the development of styles. Thenceforward the history of\r\nItalian architecture becomes the history of the achievements of\r\nindividual artists.\r\n\r\n\r\n+EARLY BEGINNINGS.+ Already in the 13th century the pulpits of Niccolo\r\nPisano at Sienna and Pisa had revealed that master’s direct recourse to\r\nantique monuments for inspiration and suggestion. In the frescoes of\r\nGiotto and his followers, and in the architectural details of many\r\nnominally Gothic buildings, classic forms had appeared with increasing\r\nfrequency during the fourteenth century. This was especially true in\r\nFlorence, which was then the artistic capital of Italy. Never, perhaps,\r\nsince the days of Pericles, had there been another community so\r\npermeated with the love of beauty in art, and so endowed with the\r\ncapacity to realize it. Nowhere else in Europe at that time was there\r\nsuch strenuous life, such intense feeling, or such free course for\r\nindividual genius as in Florence. Her artists, with unexampled\r\nversatility, addressed themselves with equal success to goldsmiths’\r\nwork, sculpture, architecture and engineering--often to painting and\r\npoetry as well; and they were quick to catch in their art the spirit of\r\nthe classic revival. The new movement achieved its first architectural\r\ntriumph in the dome of the cathedral of Florence (1420-64); and it was\r\nFlorentine--or at least Tuscan--artists who planted in other centres the\r\nseeds of the new art that were to spring up in the local and provincial\r\nschools of Sienna, Milan, Pavia, Bologna, and Venice, of Brescia, Lucca,\r\nPerugia, and Rimini, and many other North Italian cities. The movement\r\nasserted itself late in Rome and Naples, as an importation from Northern\r\nItaly, but it bore abundant fruit in these cities in its later stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PERIODS.+ The classic styles which grew up out of the Renaissance may\r\nbe divided for convenience into four periods.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY RENAISSANCE or FORMATIVE PERIOD, 1420-90; characterized by\r\nthe grace and freedom of the decorative detail, suggested by Roman\r\nprototypes and applied to compositions of great variety and originality.\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH RENAISSANCE or FORMALLY CLASSIC PERIOD, 1490-1550. During this\r\nperiod classic details were copied with increasing fidelity, the orders\r\nespecially appearing in almost all compositions; decoration meanwhile\r\nlosing somewhat in grace and freedom.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY BAROQUE (or BAROCO), 1550-1600; a period of classic formality\r\ncharacterized by the use of colossal orders, engaged columns and rather\r\nscanty decoration.\r\n\r\nTHE DECLINE or LATER BAROQUE, marked by poverty of invention in the\r\ncomposition and a predominance of vulgar sham and display in the\r\ndecoration. Broken pediments, huge scrolls, florid stucco-work and a\r\ngeneral disregard of architectural propriety were universal.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century there was a reaction from these\r\nextravagances, which showed itself in a return to the servile copying of\r\nclassic models, sometimes not without a certain dignity of composition\r\nand restraint in the decoration.\r\n\r\nBy many writers the name Renaissance is confined to the first period.\r\nThis is correct from the etymological point of view; but it is\r\nimpossible to dissociate the first period historically from those which\r\nfollowed it, down to the final exhaustion of the artistic movement to\r\nwhich it gave birth, in the heavy extravagances of the Rococo.\r\n\r\nAnother division is made by the Italians, who give the name of the\r\n_Quattrocento_ to the period which closed with the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, _Cinquecento_ to the sixteenth century, and _Seicento_ to the\r\nseventeenth century or Rococo. It has, however, become common to confine\r\nthe use of the term Cinquecento to the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CONSTRUCTION AND DETAIL.+ The architects of the Renaissance occupied\r\nthemselves more with form than with construction, and rarely set\r\nthemselves constructive problems of great difficulty. Although the new\r\narchitecture began with the colossal dome of the cathedral of Florence,\r\nand culminated in the stupendous church of St. Peter at Rome, it was\r\npre-eminently an architecture of palaces and villas, of façades and of\r\ndecorative display. Constructive difficulties were reduced to their\r\nlowest terms, and the constructive framework was concealed, not\r\nemphasized, by the decorative apparel of the design. Among the\r\nmasterpieces of the early Renaissance are many buildings of small\r\ndimensions, such as gates, chapels, tombs and fountains. In these the\r\nindividual fancy had full sway, and produced surprising results by the\r\nbeauty of enriched mouldings, of carved friezes with infant genii,\r\nwreaths of fruit, griffins, masks and scrolls; by pilasters covered with\r\narabesques as delicate in modelling as if wrought in silver; by inlays\r\nof marble, panels of glazed terra-cotta, marvellously carved doors, fine\r\nstucco-work in relief, capitals and cornices of wonderful richness and\r\nvariety. The Roman orders appeared only in free imitations, with\r\npanelled and carved pilasters for the most part instead of columns, and\r\ncapitals of fanciful design, recalling remotely the Corinthian by their\r\nvolutes and leaves (Fig. 158). Instead of the low-pitched classic\r\npediments, there appears frequently an arched cornice enclosing a\r\nsculptured lunette. Doors and windows were enclosed in richly carved\r\nframes, sometimes arched and sometimes square. Façades were flat and\r\nunbroken, depending mainly for effect upon the distribution and\r\nadornment of the openings, and the design of doorways, courtyards and\r\ncornices. Internally vaults and flat ceilings of wood and plaster were\r\nabout equally common, the barrel vault and dome occurring far more\r\nfrequently than the groined vault. Many of the ceilings of this period\r\nare of remarkable richness and beauty.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 158.--EARLY RENAISSANCE CAPITAL, PAL. ZORZI,\r\n  VENICE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE EARLY RENAISSANCE IN FLORENCE: THE DUOMO.+ In the year 1417 a\r\npublic competition was held for completing the cathedral of Florence by\r\na dome over the immense octagon, 143 feet in diameter. _Filippo\r\nBrunelleschi_, sculptor and architect (1377-1446), who with Donatello\r\nhad journeyed to Rome to study there the masterworks of ancient art,\r\nafter demonstrating the inadequacy of all the solutions proposed by the\r\ncompetitors, was finally permitted to undertake the gigantic task\r\naccording to his own plans. These provided for an octagonal dome in two\r\nshells, connected by eight major and sixteen minor ribs, and crowned by\r\na lantern at the top (Fig. 159). This wholly original conception, by\r\nwhich for the first time (outside of Moslem art) the dome was made an\r\nexternal feature fitly terminating in the light forms and upward\r\nmovement of a lantern, was carried out between the years 1420 and 1464.\r\nThough in no wise an imitation of Roman forms, it was classic in its\r\nspirit, in its vastness and its simplicity of line, and was made\r\npossible solely by Brunelleschi’s studies of Roman design and\r\nconstruction (Fig. 160).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 159.--SECTION OF DOME OF DUOMO, FLORENCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+OTHER CHURCHES.+ From Brunelleschi’s designs were also erected the\r\n+Pazzi Chapel+ in Sta. Croce, a charming design of a Greek cross covered\r\nwith a dome at the intersection, and preceded by a vestibule with a\r\nrichly decorated vault; and the two great churches of +S. Lorenzo+\r\n(1425) and +S. Spirito+ (1433-1476, Fig. 161). Both reproduced in a\r\nmeasure the plan of the Pisa Cathedral, having a three-aisled nave and\r\ntransepts, with a low dome over the crossing. The side aisles were\r\ncovered with domical vaults and the central aisles with flat wooden or\r\nplaster ceilings. All the details of columns, arches and mouldings were\r\nimitated from Roman models, and yet the result was something entirely\r\nnew. Consciously or unconsciously, Brunelleschi was reviving Byzantine\r\nrather than Roman conceptions in the planning and structural design of\r\nthese domical churches, but the garb in which he clothed them was Roman,\r\nat least in detail. The +Old Sacristy+ of S. Lorenzo was another domical\r\ndesign of great beauty.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on the new style was in general use for church designs.\r\n_L. B. Alberti_ (1404-73), who had in Rome mastered classic details more\r\nthoroughly than Brunelleschi, remodelled the church of +S. Francesco+ at\r\n+Rimini+ with Roman pilasters and arches, and with engaged orders in the\r\nfaçade, which, however, was never completed. His great work was the\r\nchurch of +S. Andrea+ at +Mantua+, a Latin cross in plan, with a dome at\r\nthe intersection (the present high dome dating however, only from the\r\n18th century) and a façade to which the conception of a Roman triumphal\r\narch was skilfully adapted. His façade of incrusted marbles for the\r\nchurch of S. M. Novella at Florence was a less successful work, though\r\nits flaring consoles over the side aisles established an unfortunate\r\nprecedent frequently imitated in later churches.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 160.--EXTERIOR OF DOME OF DUOMO, FLORENCE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 161.--INTERIOR OF S. SPIRITO, FLORENCE.]\r\n\r\nA great activity in church-building marked the period between 1475 and\r\n1490. The plans of the churches erected about this time throughout north\r\nItaly display an interesting variety of arrangements, in nearly all of\r\nwhich the dome is combined with the three-aisled cruciform plan, either\r\nas a central feature at the crossing or as a domical vault over each\r\nbay. Bologna and Ferrara possess a number of churches of this kind.\r\nOccasionally the basilican arrangement was followed, with columnar\r\narcades separating the aisles. More often, however, the pier-arches were\r\nof the Roman type, with engaged columns or pilasters between them. The\r\ninteriors, presumably intended to receive painted decorations, were in\r\nmost cases somewhat bare of ornament, pleasing rather by happy\r\nproportions and effective vaulting or rich flat ceilings, panelled,\r\npainted and gilded, than by elaborate architectural detail. A similar\r\nscantiness of ornament is to be remarked in the exteriors, excepting the\r\nfaçades, which were sometimes highly ornate; the doorways, with columns,\r\npediments, sculpture and carving, receiving especial attention. High\r\nexternal domes did not come into general use until the next period. In\r\nMilan, Pavia, and some other Lombard cities, the internal cupola over\r\nthe crossing was, however, covered externally by a lofty structure in\r\ndiminishing stages, like that of the Certosa at Pavia (Fig. 152), or\r\nthat erected by Bramante for the church of S. M. delle Grazie at Milan.\r\nAt Prato, in the church of the +Madonna delle Carceri+ (1495-1516), by\r\n_Giuliano da S. Gallo_, the type of the Pazzi chapel reappears in a\r\nlarger scale; the plan is cruciform, with equal or nearly equal arms\r\ncovered by barrel vaults, at whose intersection rises a dome of moderate\r\nheight on pendentives. This charming edifice, with its unfinished\r\nexterior of white marble, its simple and dignified lines, and internal\r\nembellishments in della-Robbia ware, is one of the masterpieces of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIn the designing of chapels and oratories the architects of the early\r\nRenaissance attained conspicuous success, these edifices presenting\r\nfewer structural limitations and being more purely decorative in\r\ncharacter than the larger churches. Such façades as that of\r\n+S. Bernardino+ at Perugia and of the +Frati di S. Spirito+ at Bologna\r\nare among the most delightful products of the decorative fancy of the\r\n15th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 162.--COURTYARD OF RICCARDI PALACE, FLORENCE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 163.--FAÇADE OF STROZZI PALACE, FLORENCE.]\r\n\r\n+FLORENTINE PALACES.+ While the architects of this period failed to\r\ndevelop any new and thoroughly satisfactory ecclesiastical type, they\r\nattained conspicuous success in palace-architecture. The +Riccardi+\r\npalace in Florence (1430) marks the first step of the Renaissance in\r\nthis direction. It was built for the great Cosimo di Medici by\r\n_Michelozzi_ (1397-1473), a contemporary of Brunelleschi and Alberti,\r\nand a man of great talent. Its imposing rectangular façade, with widely\r\nspaced mullioned windows in two stories over a massive basement, is\r\ncrowned with a classic cornice of unusual and perhaps excessive size. In\r\nspite of the bold and fortress-like character of the rusticated masonry\r\nof these façades, and the mediæval look they seem to present to modern\r\neyes, they marked a revolution in style and established a type\r\nfrequently imitated in later years. The courtyard, in contrast with this\r\nstern exterior, appears light and cheerful (Fig. 162). Its wall is\r\ncarried on round arches borne by columns with Corinthianesque capitals,\r\nand the arcade is enriched with sculptured medallions. +The Pitti\r\nPalace+, by Brunelleschi (1435), embodies the same ideas on a more\r\ncolossal scale, but lacks the grace of an adequate cornice. A lighter\r\nand more ornate style appeared in 1460 in the +P. Rucellai+, by Alberti,\r\nin which for the first time classical pilasters in superposed stages\r\nwere applied to a street façade. To avoid the dilemma of either\r\ninsufficiently crowning the edifice or making the cornice too heavy for\r\nthe upper range of pilasters, Alberti made use of brackets, occupying\r\nthe width of the upper frieze, and converting the whole upper\r\nentablature into a cornice. But this compromise was not quite\r\nsuccessful, and it remained for later architects in Venice, Verona, and\r\nRome to work out more satisfactory methods of applying the orders to\r\nmany-storied palace façades. In the great +P. Strozzi+ (Fig. 163),\r\nerected in 1490 by _Benedetto da Majano_ and _Cronaca_, the architects\r\nreverted to the earlier type of the P. Riccardi, treating it with\r\ngreater refinement and producing one of the noblest palaces of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n+COURTYARDS; ARCADES.+ These palaces were all built around interior\r\ncourts, whose walls rested on columnar arcades, as in the P. Riccardi\r\n(Fig. 162). The origin of these arcades may be found in the arcaded\r\ncloisters of mediæval monastic churches, which often suggest classic\r\nmodels, as in those of St. Paul-beyond-the-Walls and St. John Lateran at\r\nRome. Brunelleschi not only introduced columnar arcades into a number of\r\ncloisters and palace courts, but also used them effectively as exterior\r\nfeatures in the +Loggia S. Paolo+ and the Foundling Hospital (+Ospedale\r\ndegli Innocenti+) at Florence. The chief drawback in these light arcades\r\nwas their inability to withstand the thrust of the vaulting over the\r\nspace behind them, and the consequent recourse to iron tie-rods where\r\nvaulting was used. The Italians, however, seemed to care little about\r\nthis disfigurement.\r\n\r\n\r\n+MINOR WORKS.+ The details of the new style were developed quite as\r\nrapidly in purely decorative works as in monumental buildings. Altars,\r\nmural monuments, tabernacles, pulpits and _ciboria_ afforded scope for\r\nthe genius of the most distinguished artists. Among those who were\r\nspecially celebrated in works of this kind should be named _Lucca della\r\nRobbia_ (1400-82) and his successors, _Mino da Fiesole_ (1431-84) and\r\n_Benedetto da Majano_ (1442-97). Possessed of a wonderful fertility of\r\ninvention, they and their pupils multiplied their works in extraordinary\r\nnumber and variety, not only throughout north Italy, but also in Rome\r\nand Naples. Among the most famous examples of this branch of design may\r\nbe mentioned a pulpit in Sta. Croce by B. da Majano; a terra-cotta\r\nfountain in the sacristy of S. M. Novella, by the della Robbias; the\r\nMarsupini tomb in Sta. Croce, by _Desiderio da Settignano_ (all in\r\nFlorence); the della Rovere tomb in S. M. del Popolo, Rome, by Mino da\r\nFiesole, and in the Cathedral at Lucca the Noceto tomb and the\r\nTempietto, by _Matteo Civitali_. It was in works of this character that\r\nthe Renaissance oftenest made its first appearance in a new centre, as\r\nwas the case in Sienna, Pisa, Lucca, Naples, etc.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 164.--TOMB OF PIETRO DI NOCETO, LUCCA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+NORTH ITALY.+ Between 1450 and 1490 the Renaissance presented in\r\nSienna, in a number of important palaces, a sharp contrast to the\r\nprevalent Gothic style of that city. The +P. Piccolomini+--a somewhat\r\ncrude imitation of the P. Riccardi in Florence--dates from 1463; the\r\n+P. del Governo+ was built 1469, and the +Spannocchi Palace+ in 1470. In\r\n1463 _Ant. Federighi_ built there the +Loggia del Papa+. About the same\r\ntime _Bernardo di Lorenzo_ was building for Pope Pius II. (Æneas Sylvius\r\nPiccolomini) an entirely new city, +Pienza+, with a cathedral,\r\narchbishop’s palace, town hall and Papal residence (the\r\n+P. Piccolomini+), which are interesting if not strikingly original\r\nworks. Pisa possesses few early Renaissance structures, owing to the\r\nutter prostration of her fortunes in the 15th century, and the dominance\r\nof Pisan Gothic traditions. In Lucca, besides a wealth of minor\r\nmonuments (largely the work of Matteo Civitali, 1435-1501) in various\r\nchurches, a number of palaces date from this period, the most important\r\nbeing the +P. Pretorio+ and P. Bernardini. To Milan the Renaissance was\r\ncarried by the Florentine masters _Michelozzi_ and _Filarete_, to whom\r\nare respectively due the +Portinari Chapel+ in S. Eustorgio (1462) and\r\nthe earlier part of the great +Ospedale Maggiore+ (1457). In the latter,\r\nan edifice of brick with terra-cotta enrichments, the windows were\r\nGothic in outline--an unusual mixture of styles, even in Italy. The\r\nmunificence of the Sforzas, the hereditary tyrants of the province,\r\nembellished the semi-Gothic +Certosa+ of Pavia with a new marble façade,\r\nbegun 1476 or 1491, which in its fanciful and exuberant decoration, and\r\nthe small scale of its parts, belongs properly to the early Renaissance.\r\nExquisitely beautiful in detail, it resembles rather a magnified\r\naltar-piece than a work of architecture, properly speaking. Bologna and\r\nFerrara developed somewhat late in the century a strong local school of\r\narchitecture, remarkable especially for the beauty of its courtyards,\r\nits graceful street arcades, and its artistic treatment of brick and\r\nterra-cotta (+P. Bevilacqua+, +P. Fava+, at Bologna; +P. Scrofa+,\r\n+P. Roverella+, at Ferrara). About the same time palaces with interior\r\narcades and details in the new style were erected in Verona, Vicenza,\r\nMantua, and other cities.\r\n\r\n\r\n+VENICE.+ In this city of merchant princes and a wealthy _bourgeoisie_,\r\nthe architecture of the Renaissance took on a new aspect of splendor and\r\ndisplay. It was late in appearing, the Gothic style with its tinge of\r\nByzantine decorative traditions having here developed into a style well\r\nsuited to the needs of a rich and relatively tranquil community. These\r\ntraditions the architects of the new style appropriated in a measure, as\r\nin the marble incrustations of the exquisite little church of +S. M. dei\r\nMiracoli+ (1480-89), and the façade of the +Scuola di S. Marco+\r\n(1485-1533), both by _Pietro Lombardo_. Nowhere else, unless on the\r\ncontemporary façade of the Certosa at Pavia, were marble inlays and\r\ndelicate carving, combined with a framework of thin pilasters, finely\r\nprofiled entablatures and arched pediments, so lavishly bestowed upon\r\nthe street fronts of churches and palaces. The family of the _Lombardi_\r\n(Martino, his sons Moro and Pietro, and grandsons Antonio and Tullio),\r\nwith _Ant. Bregno_ and _Bart. Buon_, were the leaders in the\r\narchitectural Renaissance of this period, and to them Venice owes her\r\nchoicest masterpieces in the new style. Its first appearance is noted in\r\nthe later portions of the church of +S. Zaccaria+ (1456-1515), partly\r\nGothic internally, with a façade whose semicircular pediment and small\r\ndecorative arcades show a somewhat timid but interesting application of\r\nclassic details. In this church, and still more so in S. Giobbe\r\n(1451-93) and the Miracoli above mentioned, the decorative element\r\npredominates throughout. It is hard to imagine details more graceful in\r\ndesign, more effective in the swing of their movement, or more delicate\r\nin execution than the mouldings, reliefs, wreaths, scrolls, and capitals\r\none encounters in these buildings. Yet in structural interest, in scale\r\nand breadth of planning, these early Renaissance Venetian buildings hold\r\na relatively inferior rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PALACES.+ The great +Court+ of the +Doge’s Palace+, begun 1483 by _Ant.\r\nRizzio_, belongs only in part to the first period. It shows, however,\r\nthe lack of constructive principle and of largeness of composition just\r\nmentioned, but its decorative effect and picturesque variety elicit\r\nalmost universal admiration. Like the neighboring façade of St. Mark’s,\r\nit violates nearly every principle of correct composition, and yet in a\r\nmeasure atones for this capital defect by its charm of detail. Far more\r\nsatisfactory from the purely architectural point of view is the façade\r\nof the +P. Vendramini+ (Vendramin-Calergi), by Pietro Lombardo (1481).\r\nThe simple, stately lines of its composition, the dignity of its broad\r\narched and mullioned windows, separated by engaged columns--the earliest\r\nexample in Venice of this feature, and one of the earliest in Italy--its\r\nwell-proportioned basement and upper stories, crowned by an adequate but\r\nsomewhat heavy entablature, make this one of the finest palaces in Italy\r\n(Fig. 165) It established a type of large-windowed, vigorously modelled\r\nfaçades which later architects developed, but hardly surpassed. In the\r\nsmaller contemporary, P. Dario, another type appears, better suited for\r\nsmall buildings, depending for effect mainly upon well-ordered openings\r\nand incrusted panelling of colored marble.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 165.--VENDRAMINI PALACE, VENICE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+ROME.+ Internal disorders and the long exile of the popes had by the\r\nend of the fourteenth century reduced Rome to utter insignificance. Not\r\nuntil the second half of the fifteenth century did returning prosperity\r\nand wealth afford the Renaissance its opportunity in the Eternal City.\r\nPope Nicholas V. had, indeed, begun the rebuilding of St. Peter’s from\r\ndesigns by B. Rossellini, in 1450, but the project lapsed shortly after\r\nwith the death of the pope. The earliest Renaissance building in Rome\r\nwas the +P. di Venezia+, begun in 1455, together with the adjoining\r\nporch of S. Marco. In this palace and the adjoining unfinished\r\nPalazzetto we find the influence of the old Roman monuments clearly\r\nmanifested in the court arcades, built like those of the Colosseum, with\r\nsuperposed stages of massive piers and engaged columns carrying\r\nentablatures. The proportions are awkward, the details coarse; but the\r\nspirit of Roman classicism is here seen in the germ. The exterior of\r\nthis palace is, however, still Gothic in spirit. The architects are\r\nunknown; _Giuliano da Majano_ (1452-90), _Giacomo di Pietrasanta_, and\r\n_Meo del Caprino_ (1430-1501) are known to have worked upon it, but it\r\nis not certain in what capacity.\r\n\r\nThe new style, reaching, and in time overcoming, the conservatism of the\r\nChurch, overthrew the old basilican traditions. In +S. Agostino+\r\n(1479-83), by _Pietrasanta_, and +S. M. del Popolo+, by Pintelli (?),\r\npiers with pilasters or half-columns and massive arches separate the\r\naisles, and the crossing is crowned with a dome. To the same period\r\nbelong the Sistine chapel and parts of the Vatican palace, but the\r\ninterest of these lies rather in their later decorations than in their\r\nsomewhat scanty architectural merit.\r\n\r\nThe architectural renewal of Rome, thus begun, reached its culmination\r\nin the following period.\r\n\r\n\r\n+OTHER MONUMENTS.+ The complete enumeration of even the most important\r\nEarly Renaissance monuments of Italy is impossible within our limits.\r\nTwo or three only can here be singled out as suggesting types. Among\r\ntown halls of this period the first place belongs to the +P. del\r\nConsiglio+ at Verona, by _Fra Giocondo_ (1435-1515). In this beautiful\r\nedifice the façade consists of a light and graceful arcade supporting a\r\nwall pierced with four windows, and covered with elaborate frescoed\r\narabesques (recently restored). Its unfortunate division by pilasters\r\ninto four bays, with a pier in the centre, is a blemish avoided in the\r\ncontemporary +P. del Consiglio+ at Padua. The +Ducal Palace+ at Urbino,\r\nby _Luciano da Laurano_ (1468), is noteworthy for its fine arcaded\r\ncourt, and was highly famed in its day. At Brescia +S. M. dei Miracoli+\r\nis a remarkable example of a cruciform domical church dating from the\r\nclose of this period, and is especially celebrated for the exuberant\r\ndecoration of its porch and its elaborate detail. Few campaniles were\r\nbuilt in this period; the best of them are at Venice. Naples possesses\r\nseveral interesting Early Renaissance monuments, chief among which are\r\nthe +Porta Capuana+ (1484), by _Giul. da Majano_, the triumphal +Arch of\r\nAlphonso+ of Arragon, by _Pietro di Martino_, and the +P. Gravina+, by\r\n_Gab. d’Agnolo_. Naples is also very rich in minor works of the early\r\nRenaissance, in which it ranks with Florence, Venice, and Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nRENAISSANCE ARCHITECTURE IN ITALY--_Continued_.\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANCED RENAISSANCE AND DECLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: As before, Burckhardt, Cicognara, Fergusson,\r\n  Palustre.

Palladio_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHARACTER OF THE ADVANCED RENAISSANCE.+ It was inevitable that the\r\nstudy and imitation of Roman architecture should lead to an increasingly\r\nliteral rendering of classic details and a closer copying of antique\r\ncompositions. Toward the close of the fifteenth century the symptoms\r\nbegan to multiply of the approaching reign of formal classicism.\r\nCorrectness in the reproduction of old Roman forms came in time to be\r\nesteemed as one of the chief of architectural virtues, and in the\r\nfollowing period the orders became the principal resource of the\r\narchitect. During the so-called Cinquecento, that is, from the close of\r\nthe fifteenth century to nearly or quite 1550, architecture still\r\nretained much of the freedom and refinement of the Quattrocento. There\r\nwas meanwhile a notable advance in dignity and amplitude of design,\r\nespecially in the internal distribution of buildings. Externally the\r\norders were freely used as subordinate features in the decoration of\r\ndoors and windows, and in court arcades of the Roman type. The\r\nlantern-crowned dome upon a high drum was developed into one of the\r\nnoblest of architectural forms. Great attention was bestowed upon all\r\nsubordinate features; doors and windows were treated with frames and\r\npediments of extreme elegance and refinement; all the cornices and\r\nmouldings were proportioned and profiled with the utmost care, and the\r\nbalustrade was elaborated into a feature at once useful and highly\r\nornate. Interior decoration was even more splendid than before, if\r\nsomewhat less delicate and subtle; relief enrichments in stucco were\r\nused with admirable effect, and the greatest artists exercised their\r\ntalents in the painting of vaults and ceilings, as in P. del Té at\r\nMantua, by _Giulio Romano_ (1492-1546), and the Sistine Chapel at Rome,\r\nby Michael Angelo. This period is distinguished by an exceptional number\r\nof great architects and buildings. It was ushered in by _Bramante\r\nLazzari_, of Urbino (1444-1514), and closed during the career of\r\n_Michael Angelo Buonarotti_ (1475-1564); two names worthy to rank with\r\nthat of Brunelleschi. Inferior only to these in architectural genius\r\nwere _Raphael_ (1483-1520), _Baldassare Peruzzi_ (1481-1536), _Antonio\r\nda San Gallo the Younger_ (1485-1546), and _G. Barozzi da Vignola_\r\n(1507-1572), in Rome; _Giacopo Tatti Sansovino_ (1479-1570), in Venice,\r\nand others almost equally illustrious. This period witnessed the\r\nerection of an extraordinary series of palaces, villas, and churches,\r\nthe beginning and much of the construction of St. Peter’s at Rome, and a\r\ncomplete transformation in the aspect of that city.\r\n\r\n\r\n+BRAMANTE’S WORKS.+ While precise time limits cannot be set to\r\narchitectural styles, it is not irrational to date this period from the\r\nmaturing of Bramante’s genius. While his earlier works in Milan belong\r\nto the Quattrocento (S. M. delle Grazie, the sacristy of San Satiro, the\r\nextension of the Great Hospital), his later designs show the classic\r\ntendency very clearly. The charming +Tempietto+ in the court of\r\nS. Pietro in Montorio at Rome, a circular temple-like chapel (1502), is\r\ncomposed of purely classic elements. In the +P. Giraud+ (Fig. 166) and\r\nthe great +Cancelleria+ Palace, pilasters appear in the external\r\ncomposition, and all the details of doors and windows betray the results\r\nof classic study, as well as the refined taste of their designer.[24]\r\nThe beautiful courtyard of the Cancelleria combines the Florentine\r\nsystem of arches on columns with the Roman system of superposed arcades\r\nindependent of the court wall. In 1506 Bramante began the rebuilding of\r\nSt. Peter’s for Julius II. (see p. 294) and the construction of a new\r\nand imposing papal palace adjoining it on the Vatican hill. Of this\r\ncolossal group of edifices, commonly known as the +Vatican+, he executed\r\nthe greater Belvedere court (afterward divided in two by the Library and\r\nthe Braccio Nuovo), the lesser octagonal court of the Belvedere, and the\r\ncourt of San Damaso, with its arcades afterward frescoed by Raphael and\r\nhis school. Besides these, the cloister of S. M. della Pace, and many\r\nother works in and out of Rome, reveal the impress of Bramante’s genius,\r\nalike in their admirable plans and in the harmony and beauty of their\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: See Appendix C.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 166.--FAÇADE OF THE GIRAUD PALACE, ROME.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+FLORENTINE PALACES.+ The P. Riccardi long remained the accepted type of\r\npalace in Florence. As we have seen, it was imitated in the Strozzi\r\npalace, as late as 1489, with greater perfection of detail, but with no\r\nradical change of conception. In the +P. Gondi+, however, begun in the\r\nfollowing year by _Giuliano da San Gallo_ (1445-1516), a more pronounced\r\nclassic spirit appears, especially in the court and the interior design.\r\nEarly in the 16th century classic columns and pediments began to be used\r\nas decorations for doors and windows; the rustication was confined to\r\nbasements and corner-quoins, and niches, loggias, and porches gave\r\nvariety of light and shade to the façades (+P. Bartolini+, by _Baccio\r\nd’Agnolo_; +P. Larderel+, 1515, by _Dosio_; +P. Guadagni+, by _Cronaca_;\r\n+P. Pandolfini+, 1518, attributed to Raphael). In the +P. Serristori+,\r\nby Baccio d’Agnolo (1510), pilasters were applied to the composition of\r\nthe façade, but this example was not often followed in Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ROMAN PALACES.+ These followed a different type. They were usually of\r\ngreat size, and built around ample courts with arcades of classic model\r\nin two or three stories. The broad street façade in three stories with\r\nan attic or mezzanine was crowned with a rich cornice. The orders were\r\nsparingly used externally, and effect was sought principally in the\r\ncareful proportioning of the stories, in the form and distribution of\r\nthe square-headed and arched openings, and in the design of mouldings,\r\nstring-courses, cornices, and other details. The _piano nobile_, or\r\nfirst story above the basement, was given up to suites of sumptuous\r\nreception-rooms and halls, with magnificent ceilings and frescoes by the\r\ngreat painters of the day, while antique statues and reliefs adorned the\r\ncourts, vestibules, and niches of these princely dwellings. The\r\n+Massimi+ palace, by Peruzzi, is an interesting example of this type.\r\nThe Vatican, Cancelleria, and Giraud palaces have already been\r\nmentioned; other notable palaces are the Palma (1506) and Sacchetti\r\n(1540), by A. da San Gallo the Younger; the +Farnesina+, by Peruzzi,\r\nwith celebrated fresco decorations designed by Raphael; and the Lante\r\n(1520) and Altemps (1530), by Peruzzi. But the noblest creation of this\r\nperiod was the\r\n\r\n\r\n+FARNESE PALACE+, by many esteemed the finest in Italy. It was begun in\r\n1530 for Alex. Farnese (Paul III.) by A. da San Gallo the Younger, with\r\nVignola’s collaboration. The simple but admirable plan is shown in Fig.\r\n167, and the courtyard, the most imposing in Italy, in Fig. 168. The\r\nexterior is monotonous, but the noble cornice by Michael Angelo\r\nmeasurably redeems this defect. The fine vaulted columnar entrance\r\nvestibule, the court and the _salons_, make up an _ensemble_ worthy of\r\nthe great architects who designed it. The loggia toward the river was\r\nadded by _G. della Porta_ in 1580.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 167.--PLAN OF FARNESE PALACE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+VILLAS.+ The Italian villa of this pleasure-loving period afforded full\r\nscope for the most playful fancies of the architect, decorator, and\r\nlandscape gardener. It comprised usually a dwelling, a _casino_ or\r\namusement-house, and many minor edifices, summer-houses, arcades, etc.,\r\ndisposed in extensive grounds laid out with terraces, cascades, and\r\nshaded alleys. The style was graceful, sometimes trivial, but almost\r\nalways pleasing, making free use of stucco enrichments, both internally\r\nand externally, with abundance of gilding and frescoing. The +Villa\r\nMadama+ (1516), by Raphael, with stucco-decorations by Giulio Romano,\r\nthough incomplete and now dilapidated, is a noted example of the style.\r\nMore complete, the +Villa of Pope Julius+, by Vignola (1550), belongs by\r\nits purity of style to this period; its façade well exemplifies the\r\nsimplicity, dignity, and fine proportions of this master’s work. In\r\naddition to these Roman villas may be mentioned the +V. Medici+ (1540,\r\nby _Annibale Lippi_; now the French Academy of Rome); the +Casino del\r\nPapa+ in the Vatican Gardens, by _Pirro Ligorio_ (1560); the +V. Lante+,\r\nnear Viterbo, and the +V. d’Este+, at Tivoli, as displaying among almost\r\ncountless others the Italian skill in combining architecture and\r\ngardening.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 168.--ANGLE OF COURT OF FARNESE PALACE, ROME.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHURCHES AND CHAPELS.+ This period witnessed the building of a few\r\nchurches of the first rank, but it was especially prolific in memorial,\r\nvotive, and sepulchral chapels added to churches already existing, like\r\nthe +Chigi Chapel+ of S. M. del Popolo, by Raphael. The earlier churches\r\nof this period generally followed antecedent types, with the dome as the\r\ncentral feature dominating a cruciform plan, and simple, unostentatious\r\nand sometimes uninteresting exteriors. Among them may be mentioned: at\r\nPistoia, S. M. del Letto and +S. M. dell’ Umiltà+, the latter a fine\r\ndomical rotunda by _Ventura Vitoni_ (1509), with an imposing vestibule;\r\nat Venice, +S. Salvatore+, by _Tullio Lombardo_ (1530), an admirable\r\nedifice with alternating domical and barrel-vaulted bays; +S. Georgio\r\ndei Grechi+ (1536), by _Sansovino_, and S. M. Formosa; at Todi, the\r\n+Madonna della Consolazione+ (1510), by _Cola da Caprarola_, a charming\r\ndesign with a high dome and four apses; at Montefiascone, the +Madonna\r\ndelle Grazie+, by _Sammichele_ (1523), besides several churches at\r\nBologna, Ferrara, Prato, Sienna, and Rome of almost or quite equal\r\ninterest. In these churches one may trace the development of the dome as\r\nan external feature, while in +S. Biagio+, at Montepulciano, the effort\r\nwas made by _Ant. da San Gallo the Elder_ to combine with it the\r\ncontrasting lines of two campaniles, of which, however, but one was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 169.--ORIGINAL PLAN OF ST. PETER’S, ROME.]\r\n\r\n+ST. PETER’S.+ The culmination of Renaissance church architecture was\r\nreached in +St. Peter’s+, at Rome. The original project of Nicholas V.\r\nhaving lapsed with his death, it was the intention of Julius II. to\r\nerect on the same site a stupendous mausoleum over the monument he had\r\nordered of Michael Angelo. The design of Bramante, who began its\r\nerection in 1506, comprised a Greek cross with apsidal arms, the four\r\nangles occupied by domical chapels and loggias within a square outline\r\n(Fig. 169). The too hasty execution of this noble design led to the\r\ncollapse of two of the arches under the dome, and to long delays after\r\nBramante’s death in 1514. Raphael, Giuliano da San Gallo, Peruzzi, and\r\nA. da San Gallo the Younger successively supervised the works under the\r\npopes from Leo X. to Paul III., and devised a vast number of plans for\r\nits completion. Most of these involved fundamental alterations of the\r\noriginal scheme, and were motived by the abandonment of the proposed\r\nmonument of Julius II.; a church, and not a mausoleum, being in\r\nconsequence required. In 1546 Michael Angelo was assigned by Paul III.\r\nto the works, and gave final form to the general design in a simplified\r\nversion of Bramante’s plan with more massive supports, a square east\r\nfront with a portico for the chief entrance, and the unrivalled +Dome+,\r\nwhich is its most striking feature. This dome, slightly altered and\r\nimproved in curvature by della Porta after M. Angelo’s death in 1564,\r\nwas completed by _D. Fontana_ in 1604. It is the most majestic creation\r\nof the Renaissance, and one of the greatest architectural conceptions of\r\nall history. It measures 140 feet in internal diameter, and with its two\r\nshells rises from a lofty drum, buttressed by coupled Corinthian\r\ncolumns, to a height of 405 feet to the top of the lantern. The church,\r\nas left by Michael Angelo, was harmonious in its proportions, though the\r\nsingle order used internally and externally dwarfed by its colossal\r\nscale the vast dimensions of the edifice. Unfortunately in 1606 _C.\r\nMaderna_ was employed by Paul V. to lengthen the nave by two bays,\r\ndestroying the proportions of the whole, and hiding the dome from view\r\non a near approach. The present tasteless façade was Maderna’s work. The\r\nsplendid atrium or portico added (1629-67), by _Bernini_, as an\r\napproach, mitigates but does not cure the ugliness and pettiness of this\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 170.--PLAN OF ST. PETER’S, ROME,\r\n  AS NOW STANDING.\r\n  The portion below the line A, B, and the side chapels C, D, were\r\n  added by Maderna. The remainder represents Michael Angelo’s plan.]\r\n\r\nSt. Peter’s as thus completed (Fig. 170) is the largest church in\r\nexistence, and in many respects is architecturally worthy of its\r\npre-eminence. The central aisle, nearly 600 feet long, with its\r\nstupendous panelled and gilded vault, 83 feet in span, the vast central\r\narea and the majestic dome, belong to a conception unsurpassed in\r\nmajestic simplicity and effectiveness. The construction is almost\r\nexcessively massive, but admirably disposed. On the other hand the nave\r\nis too long, and the details not only lack originality and interest, but\r\nare also too large and coarse in scale, dwarfing the whole edifice. The\r\ninterior (Fig. 171) is wanting in the sobriety of color that befits so\r\nstately a design; it suggests rather a pagan temple than a Christian\r\nbasilica. These faults reveal the decline of taste which had already set\r\nin before Michael Angelo took charge of the work, and which appears even\r\nin the works of that master.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE PERIOD OF FORMAL CLASSICISM.+ With the middle of the 16th century\r\nthe classic orders began to dominate all architectural design. While\r\nVignola, who wrote a treatise upon the orders, employed them with\r\nunfailing refinement and judgment, his contemporaries showed less\r\ndiscernment and taste, making of them an end rather than a means. Too\r\noften mere classical correctness was substituted for the fundamental\r\nqualities of original invention and intrinsic beauty of composition. The\r\ninnovation of colossal orders extending through several stories, while\r\nit gave to exterior designs a certain grandeur of scale, tended to\r\ncoarseness and even vulgarity of detail. Sculpture and ornament began to\r\nlose their refinement; and while street-architecture gained in\r\nmonumental scale, and public squares received a more stately adornment\r\nthan ever before, the street-façades individually were too often bare\r\nand uninteresting in their correct formality. In the interiors of\r\nchurches and large halls there appears a struggle between a cold and\r\ndignified simplicity and a growing tendency toward pretentious sham. But\r\nthese pernicious tendencies did not fully mature till the latter part of\r\nthe century, and the half-century after 1540 or 1550 was prolific of\r\nnotable works in both ecclesiastical and secular architecture. The names\r\nof Michael Angelo and Vignola, whose careers began in the preceding\r\nperiod; of Palladio and della Porta (1541-1604) in Rome; of Sammichele\r\nand Sansovino in Verona and Venice, and of Galeazzo Alessi in Genoa,\r\nstand high in the ranks of architectural merit.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 171.--INTERIOR OF ST. PETER’S, ROME.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHURCHES.+ The type established by St. Peter’s was widely imitated\r\nthroughout Italy. The churches in which a Greek or Latin cross is\r\ndominated by a high dome rising from a drum and terminating in a\r\nlantern, and is treated both internally and externally with Roman\r\nCorinthian pilasters and arches, are almost numberless. Among the best\r\nchurches of this type is the +Gesù+ at Rome, by Vignola (1568), with a\r\nhighly ornate interior of excellent proportions and a less interesting\r\nexterior, the façade adorned with two stories of orders and great\r\nflanking volutes over the sides (see p. 277). Two churches at Venice, by\r\n_Palladio_--+S. Giorgio Maggiore+ (1560; façade by _Scamozzi_, 1575) and\r\nthe +Redentore+--offer a strong contrast to the Gesù, in their cold and\r\nalmost bare but pure and correct design. An imitation of Bramante’s plan\r\nfor St. Peter’s appears in +S. M. di Carignano+, at Genoa, by _Galeazzo\r\nAlessi_ (1500-72), begun 1552, a fine structure, though inferior in\r\nscale and detail to its original. Besides these and other important\r\nchurches there were many large domical chapels of great splendor added\r\nto earlier churches; of these the +Chapel of Sixtus V.+ in S. M.\r\nMaggiore, at Rome, by _D. Fontana_ (1543-1607), is an excellent example.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PALACES: ROME.+ The palaces on the Capitoline Hill, built at different\r\ndates (1540-1644) from designs by Michael Angelo, illustrate the palace\r\narchitecture of this period, and the imposing effect of a single\r\ncolossal order running through two stories. This treatment, though well\r\nadapted to produce monumental effects in large squares, was dangerous in\r\nits bareness and heaviness of scale, and was better suited for buildings\r\nof vast dimensions than for ordinary street-façades. In other Roman\r\npalaces of this time the traditions of the preceding period still\r\nprevailed, as in the +Sapienza+ (University), by della Porta (1575),\r\nwhich has a dignified court and a façade of great refinement without\r\ncolumns or pilasters. The +Papal palaces+ built by Domenico Fontana on\r\nthe Lateran, Quirinal, and Vatican hills, between 1574 and 1590,\r\nexternally copying the style of the Farnese, show a similar return to\r\nearlier models, but are less pure and refined in detail than the\r\nSapienza. The great pentagonal +Palace of Caprarola+, near Rome, by\r\nVignola, is perhaps the most successful and imposing production of the\r\nRoman classic school.\r\n\r\n\r\n+VERONA.+ Outside of Rome, palace-building took on various local and\r\nprovincial phases of style, of which the most important were the closely\r\nrelated styles of Verona, Venice, and Vicenza. _Michele Sammichele_\r\n(1484-1549), who built in Verona the +Bevilacqua+, +Canossa+, +Pompei+,\r\nand +Verzi+ palaces and the four chief city gates, and in Venice the\r\n+P. Grimani+, his masterpiece (1550), was a designer of great\r\noriginality and power. He introduced into his military architecture, as\r\nin the gates of Verona, the use of rusticated orders, which he treated\r\nwith skill and taste. The idea was copied by later architects and\r\napplied, with doubtful propriety, to palace-façades; though Ammanati’s\r\ngarden-façade for the Pitti palace, in Florence (cir. 1560), is an\r\nimpressive and successful design.\r\n\r\n\r\n+VENICE.+ Into the development of the maturing classic style _Giacopo\r\nTatti Sansovino_ (1477-1570) introduced in his Venetian buildings new\r\nelements of splendor. Coupled columns between arches themselves\r\nsupported on columns, and a profusion of figure sculpture, gave to his\r\npalace-façades a hitherto unknown magnificence of effect, as in the\r\n+Library of St. Mark+ (now the Royal Palace, Fig. 172), and the\r\n+Cornaro+ palace (P. Corner de Cà Grande), both dating from about\r\n1530-40. So strongly did he impress upon Venice these ornate and\r\nsumptuous variations on classic themes, that later architects adhered,\r\nin a very debased period, to the main features and spirit of his work.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 172.--LIBRARY OF ST. MARK, VENICE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+VICENZA.+ Of _Palladio’s_ churches in Venice we have already spoken;\r\nhis palaces are mainly to be found in his native city, Vicenza. In these\r\nstructures he displayed great fertility of invention and a profound\r\nfamiliarity with the classic orders, but the degenerate taste of the\r\nBaroque period already begins to show itself in his work. There is far\r\nless of architectural propriety and grace in these pretentious palaces,\r\nwith their colossal orders and their affectation of grandeur, than in\r\nthe designs of Vignola or Sammichele. Wood and plaster, used to mimic\r\nstone, indicate the approaching reign of sham in all design\r\n(+P. Barbarano+, 1570; +Chieregati+, 1560; +Tiene+, +Valmarano+, 1556;\r\n+Villa Capra+). His masterpiece is the two-storied arcade about the\r\nmediæval +Basilica+, in which the arches are supported on a minor order\r\nbetween engaged columns serving as buttresses. This treatment has in\r\nconsequence ever since been known as the _Palladian Motive_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+GENOA.+ During the second half of the sixteenth century a remarkable\r\nseries of palaces was erected in Genoa, especially notable for their\r\ngreat courts and imposing staircases. These last were given unusual\r\nprominence owing to differences of level in the courts, arising from the\r\nslope of their sites on the hillside. Many of these palaces were by\r\nGaleazzo Alessi (1502-72); others by architects of lesser note; but\r\nnearly all characterized by their effective planning, fine stairs and\r\nloggias, and strong and dignified, if sometimes uninteresting, detail\r\n(+P. Balbi+, +Brignole+, +Cambiasi+, +Doria-Tursi+ [or Municipio],\r\n+Durazzo+ [or Reale], +Pallavicini+, and +University+).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 173.--INTERIOR OF SAN SEVERO, NAPLES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE BAROQUE STYLE.+ A reaction from the cold _classicismo_ of the late\r\nsixteenth century showed itself in the following period, in the lawless\r\nand vulgar extravagances of the so-called _Baroque_ style. The wealthy\r\nJesuit order was a notorious contributor to the debasement of\r\narchitectural taste. Most of the Jesuit churches and many others not\r\nbelonging to the order, but following its pernicious example, are\r\nmonuments of bad taste and pretentious sham. Broken and contorted\r\npediments, huge scrolls, heavy mouldings, ill-applied sculpture in\r\nexaggerated attitudes, and a general disregard for architectural\r\npropriety characterized this period, especially in its church\r\narchitecture, to whose style the name _Jesuit_ is often applied. Sham\r\nmarble and heavy and excessive gilding were universal (Fig. 173). _C.\r\nMaderna_ (1556-1629), _Lorenzo Bernini_ (1589-1680), and _F. Borromini_\r\n(1599-1667) were the worst offenders of the period, though Bernini was\r\nan artist of undoubted ability, as proved by his colonnades or atrium in\r\nfront of St. Peter’s. There were, however, architects of purer taste\r\nwhose works even in that debased age were worthy of admiration.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 174.--CHURCH OF S. M. DELLA SALUTE, VENICE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+BAROQUE CHURCHES.+ The Baroque style prevailed in church architecture\r\nfor almost two centuries. The majority of the churches present varieties\r\nof the cruciform plan crowned by a high dome which is usually the best\r\npart of the design. Everywhere else the vices of the period appear in\r\nthese churches, especially in their façades and internal decoration.\r\n+S. M. della Vittoria+, by Maderna, and +Sta. Agnese+, by Borromini,\r\nboth at Rome, are examples of the style. Naples is particularly full of\r\nBaroque churches (Fig. 173), a few of which, like the +Gesù Nuovo+\r\n(1584), are dignified and creditable designs. The domical church of\r\n+S. M. della Salute+, at Venice (1631), by Longhena, is also a majestic\r\nedifice in excellent style (Fig. 174), and here and there other churches\r\noffer exceptions to the prevalent baseness of architecture. Particularly\r\nobjectionable was the wholesale disfigurement of existing monuments by\r\nruthless remodelling, as in S. John Lateran, at Rome, the cathedrals of\r\nFerrara and Ravenna, and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PALACES.+ These were generally superior to the churches, and not\r\ninfrequently impressive and dignified structures. The two best examples\r\nin Rome are the +P. Borghese+, by _Martino Lunghi the Elder_ (1590),\r\nwith a fine court arcade on coupled Doric and Ionic columns, and the\r\n+P. Barberini+, by Maderna and Borromini, with an elliptical staircase\r\nby Bernini, one of the few palaces in Italy with projecting lateral\r\nwings. In Venice, Longhena, in the +Rezzonico+ and +Pesaro+ palaces\r\n(1650-80), showed his freedom from the mannerisms of the age by\r\nreproducing successfully the ornate but dignified style of Sansovino\r\n(see p. 301). At Naples D. Fontana, whose works overlap the Baroque\r\nperiod, produced in the +Royal Palace+ (1600) and the +Royal Museum+\r\n(1586-1615) designs of considerable dignity, in some respects superior\r\nto his papal residences in Rome. In suburban villas, like the +Albani+\r\nand +Borghese+ villas near Rome, the ostentatious style of the Decline\r\nfound free and congenial expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n+LATER MONUMENTS.+ In the few eighteenth-century buildings which are\r\nworthy of mention there is noticeable a reaction from the extravagances\r\nof the seventeenth century, shown in the dignified correctness of the\r\nexteriors and the somewhat frigid splendor of the interiors. The most\r\nnotable work of this period is the +Royal Palace+ at +Caserta+, by _Van\r\nVitelli_ (1752), an architect of considerable taste and inventiveness,\r\nconsidering his time. This great palace, 800 feet square, encloses four\r\nfine courts, and is especially remarkable for the simple if monotonous\r\ndignity of the well proportioned exterior and the effective planning of\r\nits three octagonal vestibules, its ornate chapel and noble staircase.\r\nStaircases, indeed, were among the most successful features of late\r\nItalian architecture, as in the +Scala Regia+ of the Vatican, and in the\r\nCorsini, Braschi, and Barberini palaces at Rome, the Royal Palace at\r\nNaples, etc.\r\n\r\nIn church architecture the +east front+ of +S. John Lateran+ in Rome, by\r\n_Galilei_ (1734), and the whole +exterior+ of +S. M. Maggiore+, by\r\n_Ferd. Fuga_ (1743), are noteworthy designs: the former an especially\r\npowerful conception, combining a colossal order with two smaller orders\r\nin superposed _loggie_, but marred by the excessive scale of the statues\r\nwhich crown it. The +Fountain+ of +Trevi+, conceived in much the same\r\nspirit (1735, by _Niccola Salvi_), is a striking piece of decorative\r\narchitecture. The Sacristy of St. Peter’s, by _Marchionne_ (1775), also\r\ndeserves mention as a monumental and not uninteresting work. In the\r\nearly years of the present century the +Braccio Nuovo+ of the Vatican,\r\nby _Stern_, the imposing church of +S. Francesco di Paola+ at Naples, by\r\n_Bianchi_, designed in partial imitation of the Pantheon, and the great\r\n+S. Carlo Theatre+ at Naples, show the same coldly classical spirit, not\r\nwholly without merit, but lacking in true originality and freedom of\r\nconception.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CAMPANILES.+ The +campaniles+ of the Renaissance and Decline deserve at\r\nleast passing reference, though they are neither numerous nor often of\r\nconspicuous interest. That of the +Campidoglio+ (Capitol) at Rome, by\r\nMartino Lunghi, is a good example of the classical type. Venetia\r\npossesses a number of graceful and lofty bell-towers, generally of brick\r\nwith marble bell-stages, of which the upper part of the +Campanile+ of\r\n+St. Mark+ and the tower of S. Giorgio Maggiore are the finest examples.\r\n\r\nThe Decline attained what the early Renaissance aimed at--the revival of\r\nRoman forms. But it was no longer a Renaissance; it was a decrepit and\r\nunimaginative art, held in the fetters of a servile imitation, copying\r\nthe letter rather than the spirit of antique design. It was the mistaken\r\nand abject worship of precedent which started architecture upon its\r\ndownward path and led to the atrocious products of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS+ (mainly in addition to those mentioned in the text).\r\n  15TH CENTURY--FLORENCE: Foundling Hospital (Innocenti), 1421; Old\r\n  Sacristy and Cloister S. Lorenzo; P. Quaratesi, 1440; cloisters at\r\n  Sta.

When the Renaissance\r\nappeared, it came as a foreign importation, introduced from Italy by the\r\nking and the nobility. It underwent a protracted transitional phase,\r\nduring which the national Gothic forms and traditions were picturesquely\r\nmingled with those of the Renaissance. The campaigns of Charles VIII.\r\n(1489), Louis XII. (1499), and Francis I. (1515), in vindication of\r\ntheir claims to the thrones of Naples and Milan, brought these monarchs\r\nand their nobles into contact with the splendid material and artistic\r\ncivilization of Italy, then in the full tide of the maturing\r\nRenaissance. They returned to France, filled with the ambition to rival\r\nthe splendid palaces and gardens of Italy, taking with them Italian\r\nartists to teach their arts to the French. But while these Italians\r\nsuccessfully introduced many classic elements and details into French\r\narchitecture, they wholly failed to dominate the French master-masons\r\nand _tailleurs de pierre_ in matters of planning and general\r\ncomposition. The early Renaissance architecture of France is\r\nconsequently wholly unlike the Italian, from which it derived only minor\r\ndetails and a certain largeness and breadth of spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PERIODS.+ The French Renaissance and its sequent developments may be\r\nbroadly divided into three periods, with subdivisions coinciding more or\r\nless closely with various reigns, as follows:\r\n\r\nI. THE VALOIS PERIOD, or Renaissance proper, 1483-1589, subdivided into:\r\n\r\n_a._ THE TRANSITION, comprising the reigns of Charles VIII. and Louis\r\nXII. (1483-1515), and the early years of that of Francis I.;\r\ncharacterized by a picturesque mixture of classic details with Gothic\r\nconceptions.\r\n\r\n_b._ THE STYLE OF FRANCIS I., or Early Renaissance, from about 1520 to\r\nthat king’s death in 1547; distinguished by a remarkable variety and\r\ngrace of composition and beauty of detail.\r\n\r\n_c._ THE ADVANCED RENAISSANCE, comprising the reigns of Henry II.\r\n(1547), Francis II. (1559), Charles IX. (1560), and Henry III.\r\n(1574-89); marked by the gradual adoption of the classic orders and a\r\ndecline in the delicacy and richness of the ornament.\r\n\r\nII. THE BOURBON OR CLASSIC PERIOD (1589-1715):\r\n\r\n_a._ STYLE OF HENRY IV., covering his reign and partly that of Louis\r\nXIII. (1610-45), employing the orders and other classic forms with a\r\nsomewhat heavy, florid style of ornament.\r\n\r\n_b._ STYLE OF LOUIS XIV., beginning in the preceding reign and extending\r\nthrough that of Louis XIV. (1645-1715); the great age of classic\r\narchitecture in France, corresponding to the Palladian in Italy.\r\n\r\nIII. THE DECLINE OR ROCOCO PERIOD, corresponding with the reign of Louis\r\nXV. (1715-74); marked by pompous extravagance and capriciousness.\r\n\r\nDuring this period a reaction set in toward a severer classicism,\r\nleading to the styles of Louis XVI. and of the Empire, to be treated of\r\nin a later chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE TRANSITION.+ As early as 1475 the new style made its appearance in\r\naltars, tombs, and rood-screens wrought by French carvers with the\r\ncollaboration of Italian artificers. The tomb erected by Charles of\r\nAnjou to his father in Le Mans cathedral (1475, by _Francesco Laurana_),\r\nthe chapel of St. Lazare in the cathedral of Marseilles (1483), and the\r\ntomb of the children of Charles VIII. in Tours cathedral (1506), by\r\n_Michel Columbe_, the greatest artist of his time in France, are\r\nexamples. The schools of Rouen and Tours were especially prominent in\r\nworks of this kind, marked by exuberant fancy and great delicacy of\r\nexecution. In church architecture Gothic traditions were long dominant,\r\nin spite of the great numbers of Italian prelates in France. It was in\r\n_châteaux_, palaces, and dwellings that the new style achieved its most\r\nnotable triumphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n+EARLY CHÂTEAUX.+ The castle of Charles VIII., at Amboise on the Loire,\r\nshows little trace of Italian influence. It was under Louis XII. that\r\nthe transformation of French architecture really began. The +Château de\r\nGaillon+ (of which unfortunately only fragments remain in the École des\r\nBeaux-Arts at Paris), built for the Cardinal George of Amboise, between\r\n1497 and 1509, by _Pierre Fain_, was the masterwork of the Rouen school.\r\nIt presented a curious mixture of styles, with its irregular plan, its\r\nmoat, drawbridge, and round corner-towers, its high roofs, turrets, and\r\ndormers, which gave it, in spite of many Renaissance details, a mediæval\r\npicturesqueness. The +Château de Blois+ (the east and south wings of the\r\npresent group), begun for Louis XII. about 1500, was the first of a\r\nremarkable series of royal palaces which are the glory of French\r\narchitecture. It shows the new influences in its horizontal lines and\r\nflat, unbroken façades of brick and stone, rather than in its\r\narchitectural details (Fig. 175). The +Ducal Palace+ at Nancy and the\r\n+Hôtel de Ville+ at Orléans, by _Viart_, show a similar commingling of\r\nthe classic and mediæval styles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 175.--BLOIS, COURT FAÇADE OF WING\r\n  OF LOUIS XII.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+STYLE OF FRANCIS I.+ Early in the reign of this monarch, and partly\r\nunder the lead of Italian artists, like il Rosso, Serlio, and\r\nPrimaticcio, classic elements began to dominate the general composition\r\nand Gothic details rapidly disappeared. A simple and effective system of\r\nexterior design was adopted in the castles and palaces of this period.\r\nFinely moulded belt-courses at the sills and heads of the windows marked\r\nthe different stories, and were crossed by a system of almost equally\r\nimportant vertical lines, formed by superposed pilasters flanking the\r\nwindows continuously from basement to roof. The façade was crowned by a\r\nslight cornice and open balustrade, above which rose a steep and lofty\r\nroof, diversified by elaborate dormer windows which were adorned with\r\ngables and pinnacles (Fig. 178). Slender pilasters, treated like long\r\npanels ornamented with arabesques of great beauty, or with a species of\r\nbaluster shaft like a candelabrum, were preferred to columns, and were\r\nprovided with graceful capitals of the Corinthianesque type. The\r\nmouldings were minute and richly carved; pediments were replaced by\r\nsteep gables, and mullioned windows with stone crossbars were used in\r\npreference to the simpler Italian openings. In the earlier monuments\r\nGothic details were still used occasionally; and round corner-towers,\r\nhigh dormers, and numerous turrets and pinnacles appear even in the\r\nchâteaux of later date.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHURCHES.+ Ecclesiastical architecture received but scant attention\r\nunder Francis I., and, so far as it was practised, still clung\r\ntenaciously to Gothic principles. Among the few important churches of\r\nthis period may be mentioned +St. Etienne du Mont+, at Paris (1517-38),\r\nin which classic and Gothic features appear in nearly equal proportions;\r\nthe east end of +St. Pierre+, at Caen, with rich external carving; and\r\nthe great parish church of +St. Eustache+, at Paris (1532, by\r\n_Lemercier_), in which the plan and construction are purely Gothic,\r\nwhile the details throughout belong to the new style, though with little\r\nappreciation of the spirit and proportions of classic art. New façades\r\nwere also built for a number of already existing churches, among which\r\n+St. Michel+, at Dijon, is conspicuous, with its vast portal arch and\r\nimposing towers. The Gothic towers of Tours cathedral were completed\r\nwith Renaissance lanterns or belfries, the northern in 1507, the\r\nsouthern in 1547.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PALACES.+ To the palace at Blois begun by his predecessor, Francis I.\r\nadded a northern and a western wing, completing the court. The north\r\nwing is one of the masterpieces of the style, presenting toward the\r\ncourt a simple and effective composition, with a rich but slightly\r\nprojecting cornice and a high roof with elaborate dormers. This façade\r\nis divided into two unequal sections by the open +Staircase Tower+ (Fig.\r\n176), a _chef-d’œuvre_ in boldness of construction as well as in\r\ndelicacy and richness of carving. The outer façade of this wing is a\r\nless ornate but more vigorous design, crowned by a continuous open\r\nloggia under the roof. More extensive than Blois was +Fontainebleau+,\r\nthe favorite residence of the king and of many of his successors.\r\nFollowing in parts the irregular plan of the convent it replaced, its\r\nother portions were more symmetrically disposed, while the whole was\r\ntreated externally in a somewhat severe, semi-classic style, singularly\r\nlacking in ornament. Internally, however, this palace, begun in 1528 by\r\n_Gilles Le Breton_, was at that time the most splendid in France, the\r\ngallery of Francis I. being especially noted. The +Château+ of +St.\r\nGermain+, near Paris (1539, by _Pierre Chambiges_), is of a very\r\ndifferent character. Built largely of brick, with flat balustraded roof\r\nand deep buttresses carrying three ranges of arches, it is neither\r\nGothic nor classic, neither fortress nor palace in aspect, but a wholly\r\nunique conception.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 176.--STAIRCASE TOWER, BLOIS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 177.--PLAN OF CHAMBORD.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 178.--VIEW OF CHAMBORD.]\r\n\r\nThe rural châteaux and hunting-lodges erected by Francis I. display the\r\ngreatest diversity of plan and treatment, attesting the inventiveness of\r\nthe French genius, expressing itself in a new-found language, whose\r\nformal canons it disdained. Chief among them is the +Château of\r\nChambord+ (Figs. 177, 178)--“a Fata Morgana in the midst of a wild,\r\nwoody thicket,” to use Lübke’s language. This extraordinary edifice,\r\nresembling in plan a feudal castle with curtain-walls, bastions, moat,\r\nand donjon, is in its architectural treatment a palace with arcades,\r\nopen-stair towers, a noble double spiral staircase terminating in a\r\ngraceful lantern, and a roof of the most bewildering complexity of\r\ntowers, chimneys, and dormers (1526, by _Pierre le Nepveu_). The\r\nhunting-lodges of La Muette and Chalvau, and the so-called +Château de\r\nMadrid+--all three demolished during or since the Revolution--deserve\r\nmention, especially the last. This consisted of two rectangular\r\npavilions, connected by a lofty banquet-hall, and adorned externally\r\nwith arcades in Florentine style, and with medallions and reliefs of\r\ndella Robbia ware (1527, by _Gadyer_).\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE LOUVRE.+ By far the most important of all the architectural\r\nenterprises of this reign, in ultimate results, if not in original\r\nextent, was the beginning of a new palace to replace the old Gothic\r\nfortified palace of the Louvre. To this task Pierre Lescot was summoned\r\nin 1542, and the work of erection actually begun in 1546. The new\r\npalace, in a sumptuous and remarkably dignified classic style, was to\r\nhave covered precisely the area of the demolished fortress. Only the\r\nsouthwest half, comprising two sides of the court, was, however,\r\nundertaken at the outset (Fig. 179). It remained for later monarchs to\r\namplify the original scheme, and ultimately to complete, late in the\r\npresent century, the most extensive and beautiful of all the royal\r\nresidences of Europe. (See Figs. 181, 208, 209.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 179.--DETAIL OF COURT OF LOUVRE, PARIS.]\r\n\r\nWant of space forbids more than a passing reference to the rural castles\r\nof the nobility, rivalling those of the king. Among them Bury, La\r\nRochefoucauld, Bournazel, and especially +Azay-le-Rideau+ (1520) and\r\n+Chenonceaux+ (1515-23), may be mentioned, all displaying that love of\r\nrural pleasure, that hatred of the city and its confinement, which so\r\ndistinguish the French from the Italian Renaissance.\r\n\r\n\r\n+OTHER BUILDINGS.+ The +Hôtel-de-Ville+ (town hall), of Paris, begun\r\nduring this reign, from plans by _Domenico di Cortona_ (?), and\r\ncompleted under Henry IV., was the most important edifice of a class\r\nwhich in later periods numbered many interesting structures. The town\r\nhall of +Beaugency+ (1527) is one of the best of minor public buildings\r\nin France, and in its elegant treatment of a simple two-storied façade\r\nmay be classed with the +Maison François I.+, at Paris. This stood\r\nformerly at Moret, whence it was transported to Paris and re-erected\r\nabout 1830 in somewhat modified form. The large city houses of this\r\nperiod are legion; we can mention only the Hôtel Carnavalet at Paris;\r\nthe Hôtel Bourgtheroude at Rouen; the Hôtel d’Écoville at Caen; the\r\narchbishop’s palace at Sens, and a number of houses in Orléans. The\r\n+Tomb of Louis XII.+, at St. Denis, deserves especial mention for its\r\nfine proportions and beautiful arabesques.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE ADVANCED RENAISSANCE.+ By the middle of the sixteenth century the\r\nnew style had lost much of its earlier charm. The orders, used with\r\nincreasing frequency, were more and more conformed to antique\r\nprecedents. Façades were flatter and simpler, cornices more pronounced,\r\narches more Roman in treatment, and a heavier style of carving took the\r\nplace of the delicate arabesques of the preceding age. The reigns of\r\nHenry II. (1547-59) and Charles IX. (1560-74) were especially\r\ndistinguished by the labors of three celebrated architects: _Pierre\r\nLescot_ (1515-78), who continued the work on the southwest angle of the\r\nLouvre; _Jean Bullant_ (1515-78), to whom are due the right wing of\r\nEcouen and the porch of colossal Corinthian columns in the left wing of\r\nthe same, built under Francis I.; and, finally, _Philibert de l’Orme_\r\n(1515-70). _Jean Goujon_ (1510-72) also executed during this period most\r\nof the remarkable architectural sculptures which have made his name one\r\nof the most illustrious in the annals of French art. Chief among the\r\nworks of de l’Orme was the palace of the +Tuileries+, built under\r\nCharles IX. for Cathérine de Médicis, not far from the Louvre, with\r\nwhich it was ultimately connected by a long gallery. Of the vast plan\r\nconceived for this palace, and comprising a succession of courts and\r\nwings, only a part of one side was erected (1564-72). This consisted of\r\na domical pavilion, flanked by low wings only a story and a half high,\r\nto which were added two stories under Henry IV., to the great advantage\r\nof the design. Another masterpiece was the +Château d’Anet+, built in\r\n1552 by Henry II. for Diane de Poitiers, of which, unfortunately, only\r\nfragments survive. This beautiful edifice, while retaining the\r\nsemi-military moat and bastions of feudal tradition, was planned with\r\nclassic symmetry, adorned with superposed orders, court arcades, and\r\nrectangular corner-pavilions, and provided with a domical cruciform\r\nchapel, the earliest of its class in France. All the details were\r\nunusually pure and correct, with just enough of freedom and variety to\r\nlend a charm wanting in later works of the period. To the reign of Henry\r\nII. belong also the châteaux of Ancy-le-Franc, Verneuil, Chantilly (the\r\n“petit château,” by Bullant), the banquet-hall over the bridge at\r\nChenonceaux (1556), several notable residences at Toulouse, and the tomb\r\nof Francis I. at St. Denis. The châteaux of +Pailly+ and +Sully+,\r\ndistinguished by the sobriety and monumental quality of their\r\ncomposition, in which the orders are important elements, belong to the\r\nreign of Charles IX., together with the Tuileries, already mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 180.--THE LUXEMBURG, PARIS.]\r\n\r\n+THE CLASSIC PERIOD: HENRY IV.+ Under this energetic but capricious\r\nmonarch (1589-1610) and his Florentine queen, Marie de Médicis,\r\narchitecture entered upon a new period of activity and a new stage of\r\ndevelopment. Without the charm of the early Renaissance or the\r\nstateliness of the age of Louis XIV., it has a touch of the Baroque,\r\nattributable partly to the influence of Marie de Médicis and her Italian\r\nprelates, and partly to the Italian training of many of the French\r\narchitects. The great work of this period was the extension of the\r\nTuileries by _J. B. du Cerceau_, and the completion, by _Métézeau_ and\r\nothers, of the long gallery next the Seine, begun under Henry II., with\r\nthe view of connecting the Tuileries with the Louvre. In this part of\r\nthe work colossal orders were used with indifferent effect. Next in\r\nimportance was the addition to Fontainebleau of a great court to the\r\neastward, whose relatively quiet and dignified style offers less\r\ncontrast than one might expect to the other wings and courts dating from\r\nFrancis I. More successful architecturally than either of the above was\r\nthe +Luxemburg+ palace, built for the queen by _Salomon De Brosse_, in\r\n1616 (Fig. 180). Its plan presents the favorite French arrangement of a\r\nmain building separated from the street by a garden or court, the latter\r\nsurrounded on three sides by low wings containing the dependencies.\r\nExternally, rusticated orders recall the garden front of the Pitti at\r\nFlorence; but the scale is smaller, and the projecting pavilions and\r\nhigh roofs give it a grace and picturesqueness wanting in the Florentine\r\nmodel. The +Place Royale+, at Paris, and the château of Beaumesnil,\r\nillustrate a type of brick-and-stone architecture much in vogue at this\r\ntime, stone quoins decorating the windows and corners, and the orders\r\nbeing generally omitted.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XIII. the Tuileries were extended northward and the Louvre\r\nas built by Lescot was doubled in size by the architect _Lemercier_, the\r\nPavillon de l’Horloge being added to form the centre of the enlarged\r\ncourt façade.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHURCHES.+ To this reign belong also the most important churches of the\r\nperiod. The church of +St. Paul-St. Louis+, at Paris (1627, by\r\n_Derrand_), displays the worst faults of the time, in the overloaded and\r\nmeaningless decoration of its uninteresting front. Its internal dome is\r\nthe earliest in Paris. Far superior was the chapel of the +Sorbonne+,\r\na well-designed domical church by _Lemercier_, with a sober and\r\nappropriate exterior treated with superposed orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PERIOD OF LOUIS XIV.+ This was an age of remarkable literary and\r\nartistic activity, pompous and pedantic in many of its manifestations,\r\nbut distinguished also by productions of a very high order. Although\r\ncontemporary with the Italian Baroque--Bernini having been the guest of\r\nLouis XIV.--the architecture of this period was free from the wild\r\nextravagances of that style. In its often cold and correct dignity it\r\nresembled rather that of Palladio, making large use of the orders in\r\nexterior design, and tending rather to monotony than to overloaded\r\ndecoration. In interior design there was more of lightness and caprice.\r\nPapier-maché and stucco were freely used in a fanciful style of relief\r\nornamentation by scrolls, wreaths, shells, etc., and decorative\r\npanelling was much employed. The whole was saved from triviality only by\r\nthe controlling lines of the architecture which framed it. But it was\r\nbetter suited to cabinet-work or to the prettinesses of the boudoir than\r\nto monumental interiors. The +Galerie d’Apollon+, built during this\r\nreign over the Petite Galerie in the Louvre, escapes this reproach,\r\nhowever, by the sumptuous dignity of its interior treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n+VERSAILLES.+ This immense edifice, built about an already existing\r\nvilla of Louis XIII., was the work of _Levau_ and _J. H. Mansart_\r\n(1647-1708). Its erection, with the laying out of its marvellous park,\r\nalmost exhausted the resources of the realm, but with results quite\r\nincommensurate with the outlay. In spite of its vastness, its exterior\r\nis commonplace; the orders are used with singular monotony, which is not\r\nredeemed by the deep breaks and projections of the main front. There is\r\nno controlling or dominant feature; there is no adequate entrance or\r\napproach; the grand staircases are badly placed and unworthily treated,\r\nand the different elements of the plan are combined with singular lack\r\nof the usual French sense of monumental and rational arrangement. The\r\nchapel is by far the best single feature in the design.\r\n\r\nFar more successful was the completion of the Louvre, in 1688, from the\r\ndesigns of _Claude Perrault_, the court physician, whose plans were\r\nfortunately adopted in preference to those of Bernini. For the east\r\nfront he designed a magnificent Corinthian colonnade nearly 600 feet\r\nlong, with coupled columns upon a plain high basement, and with a\r\ncentral pediment and terminal pavilions (Fig. 181). The whole forms one\r\nof the most imposing façades in existence; but it is a mere decoration,\r\nhaving no practical relation to the building behind it. Its height\r\nrequired the addition of a third story to match it on the north and\r\nsouth sides of the court, which as thus completed quadrupled the\r\noriginal area proposed by Lescot. Fortunately the style of Lescot’s work\r\nwas retained throughout in the court façades, while externally the\r\ncolonnade was recalled on the south front by a colossal order of\r\npilasters. The Louvre as completed by Louis XIV. was a stately and noble\r\npalace, as remarkable for the surpassing excellence of the sculptures of\r\nJean Goujon as for the dignity and beauty of its architecture. Taken in\r\nconnection with the Tuileries, it was unrivalled by any palace in Europe\r\nexcept the Vatican.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 181.--COLONNADE OF LOUVRE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+OTHER BUILDINGS.+ To Louis XIV. is also due the vast but uninteresting\r\n+Hôtel des Invalides+ or veteran’s asylum, at Paris, by J. H. Mansart.\r\nTo the chapel of this institution was added, in 1680-1706, the\r\ncelebrated +Dome+ of the Invalides, a masterpiece by the same architect.\r\nIn plan it somewhat resembles Bramante’s scheme for St. Peter’s--a Greek\r\ncross with domical chapels in the four angles and a dome over the\r\ncentre. The exterior (Fig. 182), with the lofty gilded dome on a high\r\ndrum adorned with engaged columns, is somewhat high for its breadth, but\r\nis a harmonious and impressive design; and the interior, if somewhat\r\ncold, is elegant and well proportioned. The chief innovation in the\r\ndesign was the wide separation of the interior stone dome from the lofty\r\nexterior decorative cupola and lantern of wood, this separation being\r\ndesigned to meet the conflicting demands of internal and external\r\neffect. To the same architect is due the formal monotony of the +Place\r\nVendôme+, all the houses surrounding it being treated with a uniform\r\narchitecture of colossal pilasters, at once monumental and\r\ninappropriate. One of the most pleasing designs of the time is the\r\n+Château de Maisons+ (1658), by _F. Mansart_, uncle of J. H. Mansart. In\r\nthis the proportions of the central and terminal pavilions, the mass and\r\nlines of the steep roof _à la Mansarde_, the simple and effective use of\r\nthe orders, and the refinement of all the details impart a grace of\r\naspect rare in contemporary works. The same qualities appear also in the\r\n+Val-de-Grâce+, by F. Mansart and Lemercier, a domical church of\r\nexcellent proportions begun under Louis XIII. The want of space forbids\r\nmention of other buildings of this period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 182.--DOME OF THE INVALIDES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE DECLINE.+ Under Louis XV. the pedantry of the classic period gave\r\nplace to a protracted struggle between license and the severest\r\nclassical correctness. The exterior designs of this time were often even\r\nmore uninteresting and bare than under Louis XIV.; while, on the other\r\nhand, interior decoration tended to the extreme of extravagance and\r\ndisregard of constructive propriety. Contorted lines and crowded\r\nscrolls, shells, and palm-leaves adorned the mantelpieces, cornices, and\r\nceilings, to the almost complete suppression of straight lines.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 183.--FAÇADE OF ST. SULPICE, PARIS.]\r\n\r\nWhile these tendencies prevailed in many directions, a counter-current\r\nof severe classicism manifested itself in the designs of a number of\r\nimportant public buildings, in which it was sought to copy the grandeur\r\nof the old Roman colonnades and arcades. The important church of +St.\r\nSulpice+ at Paris (Fig. 183) is an excellent example of this. Its\r\ninterior, dating from the preceding century, is well designed, but in no\r\nwise a remarkable composition, following Italian models. The façade,\r\nadded in 1755 by _Servandoni_, is, on the other hand, one of the most\r\nstriking architectural objects in the city. It is a correct and well\r\nproportioned classic composition in two stories--an Ionic arcade over a\r\nDoric colonnade, surmounted by two lateral turrets. Other monuments of\r\nthis classic revival will be noticed in Chapter XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PUBLIC SQUARES.+ Much attention was given to the embellishment of open\r\nspaces in the cities, for which the classic style was admirably suited.\r\nThe most important work of this kind was that on the north side of the\r\nPlace de la Concorde, Paris. This splendid square, perhaps, on the\r\nwhole, the finest in Europe (though many of its best features belong to\r\na later date), was at this time adorned with the two monumental\r\ncolonnades by _Gabriel_. These colonnades, which form the decorative\r\nfronts for blocks of houses, deserve praise for the beauty of their\r\nproportions, as well as for the excellent treatment of the arcade on\r\nwhich they rest, and of the pavilions at the ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n+IN GENERAL.+ French Renaissance architecture is marked by good\r\nproportions and harmonious and appropriate detail. Its most interesting\r\nphase was unquestionably that of Francis I., so far, at least, as\r\nconcerns exterior design. It steadily progressed, however, in its\r\nmastery of planning; and in its use of projecting pavilions crowned by\r\ndominant masses of roof, it succeeded in preserving, even in severely\r\nclassic designs, a picturesqueness and variety otherwise impossible.\r\nRoofs, dormers, chimneys, and staircases it treated with especial\r\nsuccess; and in these matters, as well as in monumental dispositions of\r\nplan, the French have largely retained their pre-eminence to our own\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS.+ (Mainly supplementary to text.

In these seignorial residences a\r\ndegenerate form of the Gothic, known as the Tudor style, was employed\r\nduring the reigns of Henry VII. and Henry VIII., and they still retained\r\nmuch of the feudal aspect of the Middle Ages. This style, with its\r\nbroad, square windows and ample halls, was well suited to domestic\r\narchitecture, as well as to collegiate buildings, of which a\r\nconsiderable number were erected at this time. Among the more important\r\npalaces and manor-houses of this period are the earlier parts of Hampton\r\nCourt, Haddon and Hengreave Halls, and the now ruined castles of Raglan\r\nand Wolterton.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 184.--BURGHLEY HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n+ELIZABETHAN STYLE.+ Under Elizabeth (1558-1603) the progress of classic\r\nculture and the employment of Dutch and Italian artists led to a gradual\r\nintroduction of Renaissance forms, which, as in France, were at first\r\nmingled with others of Gothic origin. Among the foreign artists in\r\nEngland were the versatile Holbein, Trevigi and Torregiano from Italy,\r\nand Theodore Have, Bernard Jansen, and Gerard Chrismas from Holland. The\r\npointed arch disappeared, and the orders began to be used as subordinate\r\nfeatures in the decoration of doors, windows, chimneys, and mantels.\r\nOpen-work balustrades replaced externally the heavy Tudor battlements,\r\nand a peculiar style of carving in flat relief-patterns, resembling\r\n_appliqué_ designs cut out with the jigsaw and attached by nails or\r\nrivets, was applied with little judgment to all possible features.\r\nCeilings were commonly finished in plaster, with elaborate interlacing\r\npatterns in low relief; and this, with the increasing use of interior\r\nwoodwork, gave to the mansions of this time a more homelike but less\r\nmonumental aspect internally. English architects, like Smithson and\r\nThorpe, now began to win the patronage at first monopolized by\r\nforeigners. In +Wollaton Hall+ (1580), by Smithson, the orders were used\r\nfor the main composition with mullioned windows, much after the fashion\r\nof +Longleat House+, completed a year earlier by his master, John of\r\nPadua. During the following period, however (1590-1610), there was a\r\nreaction toward the Tudor practice, and the orders were again relegated\r\nto subordinate uses. Of their more monumental employment, the +Gate of\r\nHonor+ of Caius College, Cambridge, is one of the earliest examples.\r\nHardwicke and Charlton Halls, and Burghley, Hatfield, and Holland Houses\r\n(Fig. 184), are noteworthy monuments of the style.\r\n\r\n\r\n+JACOBEAN STYLE.+ During the reign of James I. (1603-25), details of\r\nclassic origin came into more general use, but caricatured almost beyond\r\nrecognition. The orders, though much employed, were treated without\r\ncorrectness or grace, and the ornament was unmeaning and heavy. It is\r\nnot worth while to dwell further upon this style, which produced no\r\nimportant public buildings, and soon gave way to a more rigid\r\nclassicism.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CLASSIC PERIOD.+ If the classic style was late in its appearance in\r\nEngland, its final sway was complete and long-lasting. It was _Inigo\r\nJones_ (1572-1652) who first introduced the correct and monumental style\r\nof the Italian masters of classic design. For Palladio, indeed, he seems\r\nto have entertained a sort of veneration, and the villa which he\r\ndesigned at Chiswick was a reduced copy of Palladio’s Villa Capra, near\r\nVicenza. This and other works of his show a failure to appreciate the\r\nunsuitability of Italian conceptions to the climate and tastes of Great\r\nBritain; his efforts to popularize Palladian architecture, without the\r\nresources which Palladio controlled in the way of decorative sculpture\r\nand painting, were consequently not always happy in their results. His\r\ngreatest work was the design for a new +Palace at Whitehall+, London. Of\r\nthis colossal scheme, which, if completed, would have ranked as the\r\ngrandest palace of the time, only the +Banqueting Hall+ (now used as a\r\nmuseum) was ever built (Fig. 185). It is an effective composition in two\r\nstories, rusticated throughout and adorned with columns and pilasters,\r\nand contains a fine vaulted hall in three aisles. The plan of the\r\npalace, which was to have measured 1,152 × 720 feet, was excellent,\r\nlargely conceived and carefully studied in its details, but it was\r\nwholly beyond the resources of the kingdom. The garden-front of\r\n+Somerset House+ (1632; demolished) had the same qualities of simplicity\r\nand dignity, recalling the works of Sammichele. Wilton House, Coleshill,\r\nthe Villa at Chiswick, and St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, are the best known\r\nof his works, showing him to have been a designer of ability, but hardly\r\nof the consummate genius which his admirers attribute to him.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 185.--BANQUETING HALL, WHITEHALL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 186.--PLAN OF ST. PAUL’S, LONDON.]\r\n\r\n+ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL.+ The greatest of Jones’s successors was _Sir\r\nChristopher Wren_ (1632-1723), principally known as the architect of\r\n+St. Paul’s Cathedral+, London, built to replace the earlier Gothic\r\ncathedral destroyed in the great fire of 1666. It was begun in 1675, and\r\nits designer had the rare good fortune to witness its completion in\r\n1710. The plan, as finally adopted, retained the general proportions of\r\nan English Gothic church, measuring 480 feet in length, with transepts\r\n250 feet long, and a grand rotunda 108 feet in diameter at the crossing\r\n(Fig. 186). The style was strictly Italian, treated with sobriety and\r\ndignity, if somewhat lacking in variety and inspiration. Externally two\r\nstories of the Corinthian order appear, the upper story being merely a\r\nscreen to hide the clearstory and its buttresses. This is an\r\narchitectural deception, not atoned for by any special beauty of detail.\r\nThe dominant feature of the design is the dome over the central area. It\r\nconsists of an inner shell, reaching a height of 216 feet, above which\r\nrises the exterior dome of wood, surmounted by a stone lantern, the\r\nsummit of which is 360 feet from the pavement (Fig. 187). This exterior\r\ndome, springing from a high drum surrounded by a magnificent peristyle,\r\ngives to the otherwise commonplace exterior of the cathedral a signal\r\nmajesty of effect. Next to the dome the most successful part of the\r\ndesign is the west front, with its two-storied porch and flanking\r\nbell-turrets. Internally the excessive relative length, especially that\r\nof the choir, detracts from the effect of the dome, and the poverty of\r\ndetail gives the whole a somewhat bare aspect. It is intended to relieve\r\nthis ultimately by a systematic use of mosaic decoration, especially in\r\nthe dome. The central area itself, in spite of the awkward treatment of\r\nthe four smaller arches of the eight which support the dome, is a noble\r\ndesign, occupying the whole width of the three aisles, like the Octagon\r\nat Ely, and producing a striking effect of amplitude and grandeur. The\r\ndome above it is constructively interesting from the employment of a\r\ncone of brick masonry to support the stone lantern which rises above the\r\nexterior wooden shell. The lower part of the cone forms the drum of the\r\ninner dome, its contraction upward being intended to produce a\r\nperspective illusion of increased height.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 187.--EXTERIOR OF ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nSt. Paul’s ranks among the five or six greatest domical buildings of\r\nEurope, and is the most imposing modern edifice in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n+WREN’S OTHER WORKS.+ Wren was conspicuously successful in the designing\r\nof parish churches in London. +St. Stephen’s+, Walbrook, is the most\r\nadmired of these, with a dome resting on eight columns. Wren may be\r\ncalled the inventor of the English Renaissance type of steeple, in which\r\na conical or pyramidal spire is harmoniously added to a belfry on a\r\nsquare tower with classic details. The steeple of +Bow Church+,\r\nCheapside, is the most successful example of the type. In secular\r\narchitecture Wren’s most important works were the plan for rebuilding\r\nLondon after the Great Fire; the new courtyard of Hampton Court, a quiet\r\nand dignified composition in brick and stone; the pavilions and\r\ncolonnade of +Greenwich Hospital+; the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford, and\r\nthe Trinity College Library at Cambridge. Without profound originality,\r\nthese works testify to the sound good taste and intelligence of their\r\ndesigner.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 188.--PLAN OF BLENHEIM.]\r\n\r\n+THE 18TH CENTURY.+ The Anglo-Italian style as used by Jones and Wren\r\ncontinued in use through the eighteenth century, during the first half\r\nof which a number of important country-seats and some churches were\r\nerected. _Van Brugh_ (1666-1726), _Hawksmoor_ (1666-1736), and _Gibbs_\r\n(1683-1751) were then the leading architects. Van Brugh was especially\r\nskilful in his dispositions of plan and mass, and produced in the\r\ndesigns of Blenheim and Castle Howard effects of grandeur and variety of\r\nperspective hardly equalled by any of his contemporaries in France or\r\nItaly. +Blenheim+, with its monumental plan and the sweeping curves of\r\nits front (Fig. 188), has an unusually palatial aspect, though the\r\nstriving for picturesqueness is carried too far. Castle Howard is\r\nsimpler, depending largely for effect on a somewhat inappropriate dome.\r\nTo Hawksmoor, his pupil, are due +St. Mary’s, Woolnoth+ (1715), at\r\nLondon, in which by a bold rustication of the whole exterior and by\r\nwindows set in large recessed arches he was enabled to dispense wholly\r\nwith the orders; St. George’s, Bloomsbury; the new quadrangle of All\r\nSouls at Oxford, and some minor works. The two most noted designs of\r\nJames Gibbs are +St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields+, at London (1726), and the\r\n+Radcliffe Library+, at Oxford (1747). In the former the use of a\r\nCorinthian portico--a practically uncalled-for but decorative\r\nappendage--and of a steeple mounted on the roof, with no visible lines\r\nof support from the ground, are open to criticism. But the excellence of\r\nthe proportions, and the dignity and appropriateness of the composition,\r\nboth internally and externally, go far to redeem these defects (Fig.\r\n189). The Radcliffe Library is a circular domical hall surrounded by a\r\nlower circuit of alcoves and rooms, the whole treated with\r\nstraightforward simplicity and excellent proportions. Colin Campbell,\r\nFlitcroft, Kent and Wood, contemporaries of Gibbs, may be dismissed with\r\npassing mention.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 189.--ST. MARTIN’S-IN-THE-FIELDS, LONDON.]\r\n\r\n_Sir William Chambers_ (1726-96) was the greatest of the later\r\n18th-century architects. His fame rests chiefly on his _Treatise on\r\nCivil Architecture_, and the extension and remodelling of +Somerset\r\nHouse+, in which he retained the general _ordonnance_ of Inigo Jones’s\r\ndesign, adapting it to a frontage of some 600 feet. _Robert Adams_, the\r\ndesigner of Keddlestone Hall, _Robert Taylor_ (1714-88), the architect\r\nof the Bank of England, and _George Dance_, who designed the Mansion\r\nHouse and Newgate Prison, at London--the latter a vigorous and\r\nappropriate composition without the orders--close the list of noted\r\narchitects of the eighteenth century. It was a period singularly wanting\r\nin artistic creativeness and spontaneity; its productions were nearly\r\nall dull and respectable, or at best dignified, but without charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n+BELGIUM.+ As in all other countries where the late Gothic style had\r\nbeen highly developed, Belgium was slow to accept the principles of the\r\nRenaissance in art. Long after the dawn of the sixteenth century the\r\nFlemish architects continued to employ their highly florid Gothic alike\r\nfor churches and town-halls, with which they chiefly had to do. The\r\nearliest Renaissance buildings date from 1530-40, among them being the\r\nHôtel du Saumon, at Malines, at Bruges the Ancien Greffe, by _Jean\r\nWallot_, and at Liège the +Archbishop’s Palace+, by _Borset_. The last\r\nnamed, in the singular and capricious form of the arches and\r\nbaluster-like columns of its court, reveals the taste of the age for\r\nwhat was _outré_ and odd; a taste partly due, no doubt, to Spanish\r\ninfluences, as Belgium was in reality from 1506 to 1712 a Spanish\r\nprovince, and there was more or less interchange of artists between the\r\ntwo countries. The +Hôtel de Ville+, at Antwerp, by _Cornelius de\r\nVriendt_ or _Floris_ (1518-75), erected in 1565, is the most important\r\nmonument of the Renaissance in Belgium. Its façade, 305 feet long and\r\n102 feet high, in four stories, is an impressive creation in spite of\r\nits somewhat monotonous fenestration and the inartistic repetition in\r\nthe third story of the composition and proportions of the second. The\r\nbasement story forms an open arcade, and an open colonnade or loggia\r\nruns along under the roof, thus imparting to the composition a\r\nconsiderable play of light and shade, enhanced by the picturesque\r\ncentral pavilion which rises to a height of six stories in diminishing\r\nstages. The style is almost Palladian in its severity, but in general\r\nthe Flemish architects disdained the restrictions of classic canons,\r\npreferring a more florid and fanciful effect than could be obtained by\r\nmere combinations of Roman columns, arches, and entablatures. De\r\nVriendt’s other works were mostly designs for altars, tabernacles and\r\nthe like; among them the rood screen in Tournay Cathedral. His influence\r\nmay be traced in the Hôtel de Ville at Flushing (1594).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 190.--RENAISSANCE HOUSES, BRUSSELS.]\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical architecture of the Flemish Renaissance is almost as\r\ndestitute of important monuments as is the secular. +Ste. Anne+, at\r\nBruges, fairly illustrates the type, which is characterized in general\r\nby heaviness of detail and a cold and bare aspect internally. The\r\nRenaissance in Belgium is best exemplified, after all, by minor works\r\nand ordinary dwellings, many of which have considerable artistic grace,\r\nthough they are quaint rather than monumental (Fig. 190). Stepped\r\ngables, high dormers, and volutes flanking each diminishing stage of the\r\ndesign, give a certain piquancy to the street architecture of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n+HOLLAND.+ Except in the domain of realistic painting, the Dutch have\r\nnever manifested pre-eminent artistic endowments, and the Renaissance\r\nproduced in Holland few monuments of consequence. It began there, as in\r\nmany other places, with minor works in the churches, due largely to\r\nFlemish or Italian artists. About the middle of the 16th century two\r\nnative architects, _Sebastian van Noye_ and _William van Noort_, first\r\npopularized the use of carved pilasters and of gables or steep pediments\r\nadorned with carved scallop-shells, in remote imitation of the style of\r\nFrancis I. The principal monuments of the age were town-halls, and,\r\nafter the war of independence in which the yoke of Spain was finally\r\nbroken (1566-79), local administrative buildings--mints, exchanges and\r\nthe like. The +Town Hall+ of +The Hague+ (1565), with its stepped gable\r\nor great dormer, its consoles, statues, and octagonal turrets, may be\r\nsaid to have inaugurated the style generally followed after the war.\r\nOwing to the lack of stone, brick was almost universally employed, and\r\nstone imported by sea was only used in edifices of exceptional cost and\r\nimportance. Of these the +Town Hall+ at Amsterdam holds the first place.\r\nIts façade is of about the same dimensions as the one at Antwerp, but\r\ncompares unfavorably with it in its monotony and want of interest. The\r\n+Leyden Town Hall+, by the Fleming, _Lieven de Key_ (1597), the Bourse\r\nor Exchange and the Hanse House at Amsterdam, by _Hendrik de Keyser_,\r\nare also worthy of mention, though many lesser buildings, built of brick\r\ncombined with enamelled terra-cotta and stone, possess quite as much\r\nartistic merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n+DENMARK.+ In Denmark the monuments of the Renaissance may almost be\r\nsaid to be confined to the reign of Christian IV. (1588-1648), and do\r\nnot include a single church of any importance. The royal castles of the\r\n+Rosenborg+ at Copenhagen (1610) and the +Fredericksborg+ (1580-1624),\r\nthe latter by a Dutch architect, are interesting and picturesque in\r\nmass, with their fanciful gables, mullioned windows and numerous\r\nturrets, but can hardly lay claim to beauty of detail or purity of\r\nstyle. The Exchange at Copenhagen, built of brick and stone in the same\r\ngeneral style (1619-40), is still less interesting both in mass and\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe only other important Scandinavian monument deserving of special\r\nmention in so brief a sketch as this is the +Royal Palace+ at\r\n+Stockholm+, Sweden (1698-1753), due to a foreign architect, _Nicodemus\r\nde Tessin_. It is of imposing dimensions, and although simple in\r\nexternal treatment, it merits praise for the excellent disposition of\r\nits plan, its noble court, imposing entrances, and the general dignity\r\nand appropriateness of its architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS+ (in addition to those mentioned in text).

The earliest appearance of the Renaissance in the\r\narchitecture of the German states was in the eastern provinces. Before\r\nthe close of the fifteenth century Florentine and Milanese architects\r\nwere employed in Austria, Bohemia, and the Tyrol, where there are a\r\nnumber of palaces and chapels in an unmixed Italian style. The portal of\r\nthe castle of Mahrisch-Trübau dates from 1492; while to the early years\r\nof the 16th century belong a cruciform chapel at Gran, the remodelling\r\nof the castle at Cracow, and the chapel of the Jagellons in the same\r\ncity--the earliest domical structure of the German Renaissance, though\r\nof Italian design. The +Schloss Porzia+ (1510), at Spital in Carinthia,\r\nis a fine quadrangular palace, surrounding a court with arcades on three\r\nsides, in which the open stairs form a picturesque interruption with\r\ntheir rampant arches. But for the massiveness of the details it might be\r\na Florentine palace. In addition to this, the famous +Arsenal+ at\r\nWiener-Neustadt (1524), the portal of the Imperial Palace (1552), and\r\nthe +Castle Schalaburg+ on the Danube (1530-1601), are attributed to\r\nItalian architects, to whom must also be ascribed a number of important\r\nworks at Prague. Chief among these the +Belvedere+ (1536, by _Paolo\r\ndella Stella_), a rectangular building surrounded by a graceful open\r\narcade, above which it rises with a second story crowned by a curved\r\nroof; the Waldstein Palace (1621-29), by _Giov. Marini_, with its\r\nimposing loggia; +Schloss Stern+, built on the plan of a six-pointed\r\nstar (1459-1565) and embellished by Italian artists with stucco\r\nornaments and frescoes; and parts of the palace on the Hradschin, by\r\n_Scamozzi_, attest the supremacy of Italian art in Bohemia. The same is\r\ntrue of Styria, Carinthia, and the Tyrol; _e.g._ +Schloss Ambras+ at\r\nInnsbrück (1570).\r\n\r\n\r\n+GERMANY: PERIODS.+ The earliest manifestation of the Renaissance in\r\nwhat is now the German Empire, appeared in the works of painters like\r\nDürer and Burkmair, and in occasional buildings previous to 1525. The\r\nreal transformation of German architecture, however, hardly began until\r\nafter the Peace of Augsburg, in 1555. From that time on its progress was\r\nrapid, its achievements being almost wholly in the domain of secular\r\narchitecture--princely and ducal castles, town halls or _Rathhäuser_,\r\nand houses of wealthy burghers or corporations. It is somewhat singular\r\nthat the German emperors should not have undertaken the construction of\r\na new imperial residence on a worthy scale, the palaces of Munich and\r\nBerlin being aggregations of buildings of various dates about a nucleus\r\nof mediæval origin, and with no single portion to compare with the\r\nstately châteaux of the French kings. Church architecture was neglected,\r\nowing to the Reformation, which turned to its own uses the existing\r\nchurches, while the Roman Catholics were too impoverished to replace the\r\nedifices they had lost.\r\n\r\nThe periods of the German Renaissance are less well marked than those of\r\nthe French; but its successive developments follow the same general\r\nprogression, divided into three stages:\r\n\r\nI. THE EARLY RENAISSANCE, 1525-1600, in which the orders were\r\ninfrequently used, mainly for porches and for gable decoration. The\r\nconceptions and spirit of most monuments were still strongly tinged with\r\nGothic feeling.\r\n\r\nII. THE LATE RENAISSANCE, 1600-1675, characterized by a dry, heavy\r\ntreatment, in which too often neither the fanciful gayety of the\r\nprevious period nor the simple and monumental dignity of classic design\r\nappears. Broken curves, large scrolls, obelisks, and a style of flat\r\nrelief carving resembling the Elizabethan are common. Occasional\r\nmonuments exhibit a more correct and classic treatment after Italian\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nIII. THE DECLINE OR BAROQUE PERIOD, 1675-1800, employing the orders in a\r\nstyle of composition oscillating between the extremes of bareness and of\r\nRococo over-decoration. The ornament partakes of the character of the\r\nLouis XV. and Italian Jesuit styles, being most successful in interior\r\ndecoration, but externally running to the extreme of unrestrained fancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 191.--SCHLOSS HÄMELSCHENBURG.]\r\n\r\n+CHARACTERISTICS.+ In none of these periods do we meet with the sober,\r\nmonumental treatment of the Florentine or Roman schools. A love of\r\npicturesque variety in masses and sky-lines, inherited from mediæval\r\ntimes, appears in the high roofs, stepped gables and lofty dormers which\r\nare universal. The roofs often comprise several stories, and are lighted\r\nby lofty gables at either end, and by dormers carried up from the side\r\nwalls through two or three stories. Gables and dormers alike are built\r\nin diminishing stages, each step adorned with a console or scroll, and\r\nthe whole treated with pilasters or colonnettes and entablatures\r\nbreaking over each support (Fig. 191). These roofs, dormers, and gables\r\ncontribute the most noticeable element to the general effect of most\r\nGerman Renaissance buildings, and are commonly the best-designed\r\nfeatures in them. The orders are scantily used and usually treated with\r\nutter disregard of classic canons, being generally far too massive and\r\noverloaded with ornament. Oriels, bay-windows, and turrets, starting\r\nfrom corbels or colonnettes, or rarely from the ground, diversify the\r\nfaçade, and spires of curious bulbous patterns give added piquancy to\r\nthe picturesque sky-line. The plans seldom had the monumental symmetry\r\nand largeness of Italian and French models; courtyards were often\r\nirregular in shape and diversified with balconies and spiral\r\nstaircase-turrets. The national leaning was always toward the quaint and\r\nfantastic, as well in the decoration as in the composition. Grotesques,\r\ncaryatids, _gaînes_ (half-figures terminating below in sheath-like\r\nsupports), fanciful rustication, and many other details give a touch of\r\nthe Baroque even to works of early date. The same principles were\r\napplied with better success to interior decoration, especially in the\r\nlarge halls of the castles and town-halls, and many of their ceilings\r\nwere sumptuous and well-considered designs, deeply panelled, painted and\r\ngilded in wood or plaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CASTLES.+ The _Schloss_ or _Burg_ of the German prince or duke retained\r\nthroughout the Renaissance many mediæval characteristics in plan and\r\naspect. A large proportion of these noble residences were built upon\r\nfoundations of demolished feudal castles, reproducing in a new dress the\r\nancient round towers and vaulted guard-rooms and halls, as in the\r\nHartenfels at Torgau, the Heldburg (both in Saxony), and the castle of\r\nTrausnitz, in Bavaria, among many others. The +Castle+ at +Torgau+\r\n(1540) is one of the most imposing of its class, with massive round and\r\nsquare towers showing externally, and court façades full of picturesque\r\nirregularities. In the great +Castle+ at +Dresden+ the plan is more\r\nsymmetrical, and the Renaissance appears more distinctly in the details\r\nof the Georgenflügel (1530-50), though at that early date the classic\r\norders were almost ignored. The portal of the Heldburg, however, built\r\nin 1562, is a composition quite in the contemporary French vein, with\r\nsuperposed orders and a crowning pediment over a massive basement.\r\n\r\nAnother important series of castles or palaces are of more regular\r\ndesign, in which the feudal traditions tend to disappear. The majority\r\nbelong to the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries. They\r\nare built around large rectangular courts with arcades in two or three\r\nstories on one or more sides, but rarely surrounding it entirely. In\r\nthese the segmental arch is more common than the semicircular, and\r\nsprings usually from short and stumpy Ionic or Corinthian columns. The\r\nrooms and halls are arranged _en suite_, without corridors, and a large\r\nand lofty banquet hall forms the dominant feature of the series. The\r\nearliest of these regularly planned palaces are of Italian design. Chief\r\namong them is the +Residenz+ at +Landshut+ (1536-43), with a thoroughly\r\nRoman plan, by pupils of Giulio Romano, and exterior and court façades\r\nof great dignity treated with the orders. More German in its details,\r\nbut equally interesting, is the +Fürstenhof+ at +Wismar+, in brick and\r\nterra-cotta, by _Valentino di Lira_ and _Van Aken_ (1553); while in the\r\n+Piastenschloss+ at Brieg (1547-72), by Italian architects, the\r\ntreatment in parts suggests the richest works of the style of Francis I.\r\nIn other castles the segmental arch and stumpy columns or piers show the\r\nGerman taste, as in the +Plassenburg+, by _Kaspar Vischer_ (1554-64),\r\nthe castle at Plagnitz, and the +Old Castle+ at +Stuttgart+, all dating\r\nfrom about 1550-55. +Heidelberg Castle+, in spite of its mediæval aspect\r\nfrom the river and its irregular plan, ranks as the highest achievement\r\nof the German Renaissance in palace design. The most interesting parts\r\namong its various wings built at different dates--the earlier portions\r\nstill Gothic in design--are the +Otto Heinrichsbau+ (1554) and the\r\n+Friedrichsbau+ (1601). The first of these appears somewhat simpler in\r\nits lines than the second, by reason of having lost its original\r\ndormer-gables. The orders, freely treated, are superposed in three\r\nstories, and twin windows, niches, statues, _gaînes_, medallions and\r\nprofuse carving produce an effect of great gayety and richness. The\r\nFriedrichsbau (Fig. 192), less quiet in its lines, and with high\r\nscroll-gabled and stepped dormers, is on the other hand more soberly\r\ndecorated and more characteristically German. The Schloss Hämelschenburg\r\n(Fig. 191) is designed in somewhat the same spirit, but with even\r\ngreater simplicity of detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 192.--THE FRIEDRICHSBAU, HEIDELBERG.]\r\n\r\n+TOWN HALLS.+ These constitute the most interesting class of Renaissance\r\nbuildings in Germany, presenting a considerable variety of types, but\r\nnearly all built in solid blocks without courts, and adorned with towers\r\nor spires. A high roof crowns the building, broken by one or more high\r\ngables or many-storied dormers. The majority of these town halls present\r\nfaçades much diversified by projecting wings, as at Lemgo and Paderborn,\r\nor by oriels and turrets, as at +Altenburg+ (1562-64); and the towers\r\nwhich dominate the whole terminate usually in bell-shaped cupolas, or in\r\nmore capricious forms with successive swellings and contractions, as at\r\nDantzic (1587). A few, however, are designed with monumental simplicity\r\nof mass; of these that at +Bremen+ (1612) is perhaps the finest, with\r\nits beautiful exterior arcade on strong Doric columns. The town hall of\r\nNuremberg is one of the few with a court, and presents a façade of\r\nalmost Roman simplicity (1613-19); that at +Augsburg+ (1615) is equally\r\nclassic and more pleasing; while at Schweinfurt, Rothenburg (1572),\r\nMülhausen, etc., are others worthy of mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHURCHES.+ +St. Michael’s+, at Munich, is almost the only important\r\nchurch of the first period in Germany (1582), but it is worthy to rank\r\nwith many of the most notable contemporary Italian churches. A wide nave\r\ncovered by a majestic barrel vault, is flanked by side chapels,\r\nseparated from each other by massive piers and forming a series of\r\ngallery bays above. There are short transepts and a choir, all in\r\nexcellent proportion and treated with details which, if somewhat heavy,\r\nare appropriate and reasonably correct. The +Marienkirche+ at\r\nWolfenbüttel (1608) is a fair sample of the parish churches of the\r\nsecond period. In the exterior of this church pointed arches and\r\nsemi-Gothic tracery are curiously associated with heavy rococo carving.\r\nThe simple rectangular mass, square tower, and portal with massive\r\norders and carving are characteristic features. Many of the\r\nchurch-towers are well proportioned and graceful structures in spite of\r\nthe fantastic outlines of their spires. One of the best and purest in\r\nstyle is that of the University Church at Würzburg (1587-1600).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 193.--ZWINGER PALACE, DRESDEN.]\r\n\r\n+HOUSES.+ Many of the German houses of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies would merit extended notice in a larger work, as among the\r\nmost interesting lesser monuments of the Renaissance. Nuremberg and\r\nHildesheim are particularly rich in such houses, built either for\r\nprivate citizens or for guilds and corporations. Not a few of the\r\nhalf-timbered houses of the time are genuine works of art, though\r\ninterest chiefly centres in the more monumental dwellings of stone. In\r\nthis domestic architecture the picturesque quality of German design\r\nappears to better advantage than in more monumental edifices, and their\r\nbroadly stepped gables, corbelled oriels, florid portals and want of\r\nformal symmetry imparting a peculiar and undeniable charm. The\r\nKaiserhaus and Wedekindsches Haus at Hildesheim; +Fürstenhaus+ at\r\nLeipzig; Peller, Hirschvogel, and Funk houses at Nuremberg; the Salt\r\nHouse at Frankfurt, and Ritter House at Heidelberg, are a few of the\r\nmost noted among these examples of domestic architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 194.--CHURCH OF ST. MARY (MARIENKIRCHE),\r\n  DRESDEN.]\r\n\r\n+LATER MONUMENTS.+ The +Zwinger Palace+ at Dresden (Fig. 193), is the\r\nmost elaborate and wayward example of the German palace architecture of\r\nthe third period. Its details are of the most exaggerated rococo type,\r\nlike confectioner’s work done in stone; and yet the building has an air\r\nof princely splendor which partly atones for its details. Besides this\r\npalace, Dresden possesses in the domical +Marienkirche+ (Fig. 194)\r\na very meritorious example of late design. The proportions are good, and\r\nthe detail, if not interesting, is at least inoffensive, while the whole\r\nis a dignified and rational piece of work. At Vienna are a number of\r\npalaces of the third period, more interesting for their beautiful\r\ngrounds and parks than for intrinsic architectural merit. As in Italy,\r\nthis was the period of stucco, and although in Vienna this cheap and\r\nperishable material was cleverly handled, and the ornament produced was\r\noften quaint and effective, the results lack the permanence and dignity\r\nof true building in stone or brick, and may be dismissed without further\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nIn minor works the Germans were far less prolific than the Italians or\r\nSpaniards. Few of their tombs were of the first importance, though one,\r\nthe +Sebald Shrine+, in Nuremberg, by _Peter Vischer_ (1506-19), is a\r\nsplendid work in bronze, in the transitional style; a richly decorated\r\ncanopy on slender metal colonnettes covering and enclosing the\r\nsarcophagus of the saint. There are a large number of fountains in the\r\nsquares of German and Swiss cities which display a high order of design,\r\nand are among the most characteristic minor products of German art.\r\n\r\n\r\n+SPAIN.+ The flamboyant Gothic style sufficed for a while to meet the\r\nrequirements of the arrogant and luxurious period which in Spain\r\nfollowed the overthrow of the Moors and the discovery of America. But it\r\nwas inevitable that the Renaissance should in time make its influence\r\nfelt in the arts of the Iberian peninsula, largely through the\r\nemployment of Flemish artists. In jewelry and silverwork, arts which\r\nreceived a great impulse from the importation of the precious metals\r\nfrom the New World, the forms of the Renaissance found special\r\nacceptance, so that the new style received the name of the _Plateresque_\r\n(from _platero_, silversmith). This was a not inept name for the\r\nminutely detailed and sumptuous decoration of the early Renaissance,\r\nwhich lasted from 1500 to the accession of Philip II. in 1556. It was\r\ncharacterized by surface-decoration spreading over broad areas,\r\nespecially around doors and windows, florid escutcheons and Gothic\r\ndetails mingling with delicately chiselled arabesques. Decorative\r\npilasters with broken entablatures and carved baluster-shafts were\r\nemployed with little reference to constructive lines, but with great\r\nrefinement of detail, in spite of the exuberant profusion of the\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nTo this style, after the artistic inaction of Philip II.’s reign,\r\nsucceeded the coldly classic style practised by _Berruguete_ and\r\n_Herrera_, and called the _Griego-Romano_. In spite of the attempt to\r\nproduce works of classical purity, the buildings of this period are for\r\nthe most part singularly devoid of originality and interest. This style\r\nlasted until the middle of the seventeenth century, and in the case of\r\ncertain works and artists, until its close. It was followed, at least in\r\necclesiastical architecture, by the so-called _Churrigueresque_, a name\r\nderived from an otherwise insignificant architect, _Churriguera_, who\r\nlike Maderna and Borromini in Italy, discarded all the proprieties of\r\narchitecture, and rejoiced in the wildest extravagances of an untrained\r\nfancy and debased taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n+EARLY MONUMENTS.+ The earliest ecclesiastical works of the Renaissance\r\nperiod, like the cathedrals of Salamanca, Toledo, and Segovia, were\r\nalmost purely Gothic in style. Not until 1525 did the new forms begin to\r\ndominate in cathedral design. The cathedral at +Jaen+, by _Valdelvira_\r\n(1525), an imposing structure with three aisles and side chapels, was\r\ntreated internally with the Corinthian order throughout. The Cathedral\r\nof +Granada+ (1529, by _Diego de Siloe_) is especially interesting for\r\nits great domical sanctuary 70 feet in diameter, and for the largeness\r\nand dignity of its conception and details. The cathedral of Malaga, the\r\nchurch of San Domingo at Salamanca, and the monastery of San Girolamo in\r\nthe same city are either wholly or in part Plateresque, and provided\r\nwith portals of especial richness of decoration. Indeed, the portal of\r\nS. Domingo practically forms the whole façade.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 195.--DOOR OF THE UNIVERSITY, SALAMANCA.]\r\n\r\nIn secular architecture the +Hospital+ of +Santa Cruz+ at Toledo, by\r\n_Enrique de Egaz_ (1504-16), is one of the earliest examples of the\r\nstyle. Here, as also in the +University+ at +Salamanca+ (Fig. 195), the\r\nportal is the most notable feature, suggesting both Italian and French\r\nmodels in its details. The great +College+ at +Alcala de Heñares+ is\r\nanother important early monument of the Renaissance (1500-17, by _Pedro\r\nGumiel_). In most designs the preference was for long façades of\r\nmoderate height, with a basement showing few openings, and a _bel étage_\r\nlighted by large windows widely spaced. Ornament was chiefly\r\nconcentrated about the doors and windows, except for the roof\r\nbalustrades, which were often exceedingly elaborate. Occasionally a\r\ndecorative motive is spread over the whole façade, as in the +Casa de\r\nlas Conchas+ at Salamanca, adorned with cockle-shells carved at\r\nintervals all over the front--a bold and effective device; or the\r\nInfantada palace with its spangling of carved diamonds. The courtyard or\r\n_patio_ was an indispensable feature of these buildings, as in all hot\r\ncountries, and was surrounded by arcades frequently of the most fanciful\r\ndesign overloaded with minute ornament, as in the +Infantado+ at\r\nGuadalajara, the +Casa de Zaporta+, formerly at Saragossa (now removed\r\nto Paris; Fig. 196), and the Lupiana monastery. The patios in the\r\n+Archbishop’s Palace+ at Alcala de Heñares and the +Collegio de los\r\nIrlandeses+ at Salamanca are of simpler design; that of the +Casa de\r\nPilatos+ at Seville is almost purely Moorish. Salamanca abounds in\r\nbuildings of this period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 196.--CASA DE ZAPORTA: COURTYARD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 197.--PALACE OF CHARLES V., GRANADA.]\r\n\r\n+THE GRIEGO-ROMANO.+ The more classic treatment of architectural designs\r\nby the use of the orders was introduced by _Alonzo Berruguete_\r\n(1480-1560?), who studied in Italy after 1503. The Archbishop’s Palace\r\nand the Doric +Gate+ of +San Martino+, both at Toledo, were his work, as\r\nwell as the first palace at Madrid. The Palladio of Spain was, however,\r\nby _Juan de Herrera_ (died 1597), the architect of +Valladolid\r\nCathedral+, built under Philip V. This vast edifice follows the general\r\nlines of the earlier cathedrals of Jaen and Granada, but in a style of\r\nclassical correctness almost severe in aspect, but well suited to the\r\ngrand scale of the church. The masterpiece of this period was the\r\nmonastery of the +Escurial+, begun by _Juan Battista_ of Toledo, in\r\n1563, but not completed until nearly one hundred and fifty years later.\r\nIts final architectural aspect was largely due to Herrera. It is a vast\r\nrectangle of 740 × 580 feet, comprising a complex of courts, halls, and\r\ncells, dominated by the huge mass of the chapel. This last is an\r\nimposing domical church covering 70,000 square feet, treated throughout\r\nwith the Doric order, and showing externally a lofty dome and campaniles\r\nwith domical lanterns, which serve to diversify the otherwise monotonous\r\nmass of the monastery. What the Escurial lacks in grace or splendor is\r\nat least in a measure redeemed by its majestic scale and varied\r\nsky-lines. The +Palace of Charles V.+ (Fig. 197), adjoining the Alhambra\r\nat Granada, though begun as early as 1527 by _Machuca_, was mainly due\r\nto Berruguete, and is an excellent example of the Spanish Palladian\r\nstyle. With its circular court, admirable proportions and well-studied\r\ndetails, this often maligned edifice deserves to be ranked among the\r\nmost successful examples of the style. During this period the cathedral\r\nof Seville received many alterations, and the upper part of the\r\nadjoining Moorish tower of the +Giralda+, burned in 1395, was rebuilt by\r\n_Fernando Ruiz_ in the prevalent style, and with considerable elegance\r\nand appropriateness of design.\r\n\r\nOf the +Palace+ at +Madrid+, rebuilt by Philip V. after the burning of\r\nthe earlier palace in 1734, and mainly the work of an Italian, _Ivara_;\r\nthe Aranjuez palace (1739, by _Francisco Herrera_), and the Palace at\r\n+San Ildefonso+, it need only be said that their chief merit lies in\r\ntheir size and the absence of those glaring violations of good taste\r\nwhich generally characterized the successors of Churriguera. In\r\necclesiastical design these violations of taste were particularly\r\nabundant and excessive, especially in the façades and in the\r\nsanctuary--huge aggregations of misplaced and vulgar detail, with hardly\r\nan unbroken pediment, column, or arch in the whole. Some extreme\r\nexamples of this abominable style are to be found in the\r\nSpanish-American churches of the 17th and 18th centuries, as at\r\nChihuahua (Mexico), Tucson (Arizona), and other places. The least\r\noffensive features of the churches of this period were the towers,\r\nusually in pairs at the west end, some of them showing excellent\r\nproportions and good composition in spite of their execrable details.\r\n\r\nMinor architectural works, such as the rood screens in the churches of\r\nAstorga and Medina de Rio Seco, and many tombs at Granada, Avila,\r\nAlcala, etc., give evidence of superior skill in decorative design,\r\nwhere constructive considerations did not limit the exercise of the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PORTUGAL.+ The Renaissance appears to have produced few notable works\r\nin Portugal. Among the chief of these are the +Tower+, the church, and\r\nthe +Cloister+, at Belem. These display a riotous profusion of minute\r\ncarved ornament, with a free commingling of late Gothic details,\r\nwearisome in the end in spite of the beauty of its execution (1500-40?).\r\nThe church of +Santa Cruz+ at Coimbra, and that of +Luz+, near Lisbon,\r\nare among the most noted of the religious monuments of the Renaissance,\r\nwhile in secular architecture the royal palace at +Mafra+ is worthy of\r\nmention.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +MONUMENTS.+ (Mainly supplementary to preceding text.)

(For the most part, however, recourse must be\r\n  had to the general histories of architecture, and to monographs on\r\n  special cities or buildings.)\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.+ By the end of the seventeenth century the\r\nRenaissance, properly speaking, had run its course in Europe. The\r\nincreasing servility of its imitation of antique models had exhausted\r\nits elasticity and originality. Taste rapidly declined before the growth\r\nof the industrial and commercial spirit in the eighteenth century. The\r\nferment of democracy and the disquiet of far-reaching political changes\r\nhad begun to preoccupy the minds of men to the detriment of the arts. By\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, however, the extravagances of the\r\nRococo, Jesuit, and Louis XV. styles had begun to pall upon the popular\r\ntaste. The creative spirit was dead, and nothing seemed more promising\r\nas a corrective for these extravagances than a return to classic models.\r\nBut the demand was for a literal copying of the arcades and porticos of\r\nRome, to serve as frontispieces for buildings in which modern\r\nrequirements should be accommodated to these antique exteriors, instead\r\nof controlling the design. The result was a manifest gain in the\r\nsplendor of the streets and squares adorned by these highly decorative\r\nfrontispieces, but at the expense of convenience and propriety in the\r\nbuildings themselves. While this academic spirit too often sacrificed\r\nlogic and originality to an arbitrary symmetry and to the supposed\r\ncanons of Roman design, it also, on the other hand, led to a stateliness\r\nand dignity in the planning, especially in the designing of vestibules,\r\nstairs, and halls, which render many of the public buildings it produced\r\nwell worthy of study. The architecture of the Roman Revival was pompous\r\nand artificial, but seldom trivial, and its somewhat affected grandeur\r\nwas a welcome relief from the dull extravagance of the styles it\r\nreplaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE GREEK REVIVAL.+ The Roman revival was, however, displaced in\r\nEngland and Germany by the Greek Revival, which set in near the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century. This was the result of a newly awakened interest\r\nin the long-neglected monuments of Attic art which the discoveries of\r\nStuart and Revett--sent out in 1732 by the London Society of\r\nDilettanti--had once more made known to the world. It led to a veritable\r\n_furore_ in England for Greek Doric and Ionic columns, which were\r\napplied indiscriminately to every class of buildings, with utter\r\ndisregard of propriety. The British taste was at this time at its lowest\r\nebb, and failed to perceive the poverty of Greek architecture when\r\ndeprived of its proper adornments of carving and sculpture, which were\r\nsingularly lacking in the British examples. Nevertheless the Greek style\r\nin England had a long run of popular favor, yielding only during the\r\nreign of the present sovereign to the so-called Victorian Gothic,\r\na revival of mediæval forms. In Germany the Greek Revival was\r\ncharacterized by a more cultivated taste and a more rational application\r\nof its forms, which were often freely modified to suit modern needs. In\r\nFrance, where the Roman Revival under Louis XV. had produced fairly\r\nsatisfactory results, and where the influence of the Royal School of\r\nFine Arts (_École des Beaux-Arts_) tended to perpetuate the principles\r\nof Roman design, the Greek Revival found no footing. The Greek forms\r\nwere seen to be too severe and intractable for present requirements.\r\nAbout 1830, however, a modified style of design, known since as the\r\n_Néo-Grec_, was introduced by the exertions of a small coterie of\r\ntalented architects; and though its own life was short, it profoundly\r\ninfluenced French art in the direction of freedom and refinement for a\r\nlong time afterward. In Italy there was hardly anything in the nature of\r\na true revival of either Roman or Greek forms. The few important works\r\nof the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were conceived in\r\nthe spirit of the late Renaissance, and took from the prevalent revival\r\nof classicism elsewhere merely a greater correctness of detail, not any\r\nradical change of form or spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 198.--BRITISH MUSEUM, LONDON.]\r\n\r\n+ENGLAND.+ There was, strictly speaking, no Roman revival in Great\r\nBritain. The modified Palladian style of Wren and Gibbs and their\r\nsuccessors continued until superseded by the Greek revival. The first\r\nfruit of the new movement seems to have been the +Bank of England+ at\r\nLondon, by _Sir John Soane_ (1788). In this edifice the Greco-Roman\r\norder of the round temple at Tivoli was closely copied, and applied to a\r\nlong façade, too low for its length and with no sufficient stylobate,\r\nbut fairly effective with its recessed colonnade and unpierced walls.\r\nThe +British Museum+, by _Robert Smirke_ (Fig. 198), was a more\r\nambitious essay in a more purely Greek style. Its colossal Ionic\r\ncolonnade was, however, a mere frontispiece, applied to a badly planned\r\nand commonplace building, from which it cut off needed light. The more\r\nmodest but appropriate columnar façade to the +Fitzwilliam Museum+ at\r\nCambridge, by _Bassevi_, was a more successful attempt in the same\r\ndirection, better proportioned and avoiding the incongruity of modern\r\nwindows in several stories. These have always been the stumbling-block\r\nof the revived Greek style. The difficulties they raise are avoided,\r\nhowever, in buildings presenting but two stories, the order being\r\napplied to the upper story, upon a high stylobate serving as a basement.\r\nThe +High School+ and the Royal Institution at Edinburgh, and the\r\nUniversity at London, by _Wilkins_, are for this reason, if for no\r\nother, superior to the British Museum and other many-storied Anglo-Greek\r\nedifices. In spite of all difficulties, however, the English extended\r\nthe applications of the style with doubtful success not only to all\r\nmanner of public buildings, but also to country residences. Carlton\r\nHouse, Bowden Park, and Grange House are instances of this\r\nmisapplication of Greek forms. Neither did it prove more tractable for\r\necclesiastical purposes. +St. Pancras’s+ Church at London, and several\r\nchurches by _Thomson_ (1817-75), in Glasgow, though interesting as\r\nexperiments in such adaptation, are not to be commended for imitation.\r\nThe most successful of all British Greek designs is perhaps +St.\r\nGeorge’s Hall+ at Liverpool (Fig. 199), whose imposing peristyle and\r\nporches are sufficiently Greek in spirit and detail to class it among\r\nthe works of the Greek Revival. But its great hall and its interior\r\ncomposition are really Roman and not Greek, emphasizing the teaching of\r\nexperience that Greek architecture does not lend itself to the\r\nexigencies of modern civilization to nearly the same extent as the\r\nRoman.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 199.--ST. GEORGE’S HALL, LIVERPOOL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 200.--THE OLD MUSEUM, BERLIN.]\r\n\r\n+GERMANY.+ During the eighteenth century the classic revival in Germany,\r\nwhich at first followed Roman precedents (as in the columns carved with\r\nspirally ascending reliefs in front of the church of +St. Charles\r\nBorromeo+, at Vienna), was directed into the channel of Greek imitation\r\nby the literary works of Winckelmann, Lessing, Goethe, and others, as\r\nwell as by the interest aroused by the discoveries of Stuart and Revett.\r\nThe +Brandenburg Gate+ at Berlin (1784, by Langhans) was an early\r\nexample of this Hellenism in architecture, and one of its most\r\nsuccessful applications to civic purposes. Without precisely copying any\r\nGreek structure, it was evidently inspired from the Athenian Propylæa,\r\nand nothing in its purpose is foreign to the style employed. The\r\ngreatest activity in the style came later, however, and was greatly\r\nstimulated by the achievements of _Fr. Schinkel_ (1771-1841), one of the\r\ngreatest of modern German architects. While in the domical church of St.\r\nNicholas at Potsdam, he employed Roman forms in a modernized Roman\r\nconception, and followed in one or two other buildings the principles of\r\nthe Renaissance, his predilections were for Greek architecture. His\r\nmasterpiece was the +Museum+ at Berlin, with an imposing portico of 18\r\nIonic columns (Fig. 200). This building with its fine rotunda was\r\nexcellently planned, and forms, in conjunction with the +New Museum+ by\r\n_Stuhler_ (1843-55), a noble palace of art, to whose monumental\r\nrequirements and artistic purpose the Greek colonnades and pediments\r\nwere not inappropriate. Schinkel’s greatest successor was _Leo von\r\nKlenze_ (1784-1864), whose more textual reproductions of Greek models\r\nwon him great favor and wide employment. The +Walhalla+ near Ratisbon is\r\na modernized Parthenon, internally vaulted with glass; elegant\r\nexternally, but too obvious a plagiarism to be greatly admired. The\r\n+Ruhmeshalle+ at Munich, a double +L+ partly enclosing a colossal\r\nstatue of Bavaria, and devoted to the commemoration of Bavaria’s great\r\nmen, is copied from no Greek building, though purely Greek in design and\r\ncorrect to the smallest detail. In the +Glyptothek+ (Sculpture Gallery),\r\nin the same city, the one distinctively Greek feature introduced by\r\nKlenze, an Ionic portico, is also the one inappropriate note in the\r\ndesign. The +Propylæa+ at Munich, by the same (Fig. 201), and the +Court\r\nTheatre+ at Berlin, by Schinkel, are other important examples of the\r\nstyle. The latter is externally one of the most beautiful theatres in\r\nEurope, though less ornate than many. Schinkel’s genius was here\r\nremarkably successful in adapting Greek details to the exigent\r\ndifficulties of theatre design, and there is no suggestion of copying\r\nany known Greek building.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 201.--THE PROPYLÆA, MUNICH.]\r\n\r\nIn Vienna the one notable monument of the Classic Revival is the\r\n+Reichsrathsgebäude+ or Parliament House, by _Th. Hansen_ (1843), an\r\nimposing two-storied composition with a lofty central colonnade and\r\nlower side-wings, harmonious in general proportions and pleasingly\r\nvaried in outline and mass.\r\n\r\nIn general, the Greek Revival in Germany presents the aspect of a\r\nsincere striving after beauty, on the part of a limited number of\r\nartists of great talent, misled by the idea that the forms of a dead\r\ncivilization could be galvanized into new life in the service of modern\r\nneeds. The result was disappointing, in spite of the excellent planning,\r\nadmirable construction and carefully studied detail of these buildings,\r\nand the movement here as elsewhere was foredoomed to failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 202.--PLAN OF PANTHÉON, PARIS.]\r\n\r\n+FRANCE.+ In France the Classic Revival, as we have seen, had made its\r\nappearance during the reign of Louis XV. in a number of important\r\nmonuments which expressed the protest of their authors against the\r\ncaprice of the Rococo style then in vogue. The colonnades of the\r\nGarde-Meuble, the façade of St. Sulpice, and the coldly beautiful\r\n+Panthéon+ (Figs. 202, 203) testified to the conviction in the most\r\ncultured minds of the time that Roman grandeur was to be attained only\r\nby copying the forms of Roman architecture with the closest possible\r\napproach to correctness. In the Panthéon, the greatest ecclesiastical\r\nmonument of its time in France (otherwise known as the church of Ste.\r\nGenéviève), the spirit of correct classicism dominates the interior as\r\nwell as the exterior. It is a Greek cross, measuring 362 × 267 feet,\r\nwith a dome 265 feet high, and internally 69 feet in diameter. The four\r\narms have domical vaulting and narrow aisles separated by Corinthian\r\ncolumns. The whole interior is a cold but extremely elegant composition.\r\nThe most notable features of the exterior are its imposing portico of\r\ncolossal Corinthian columns and the fine peristyle which surrounds the\r\ndrum of the dome, giving it great dignity and richness of effect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 203.--EXTERIOR OF PANTHÉON, PARIS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 204.--ARC DE L’ÉTOILE, PARIS.]\r\n\r\nThe dome, which is of stone throughout, has three shells, the\r\nintermediate shell serving to support the heavy stone lantern. The\r\narchitect was _Soufflot_ (1713-81). The +Grand Théâtre+, at Bordeaux\r\n(1773, by _Victor Louis_), one of the largest and finest theatres in\r\nEurope, was another product of this movement, its stately colonnade\r\nforming one of the chief ornaments of the city. Under Louis XVI. there\r\nwas a temporary reaction from this somewhat pompous affectation of\r\nantique grandeur; but there were few important buildings erected during\r\nthat unhappy reign, and the reaction showed itself mainly in a more\r\ndelicate and graceful style of interior decoration. It was reserved for\r\nthe Empire to set the seal of official approval on the Roman Revival.\r\nThe Arch of Triumph of the Carrousel, behind the Tuileries, by _Percier\r\nand Fontaine_, the magnificent Arc de l’Étoile, at the summit of the\r\nAvenue of the Champs Elysées, by _Chalgrin_; the wing begun by Napoleon\r\nto connect the Tuileries with the Louvre on the land side, and the\r\nchurch of the Madeleine, by _Vignon_, erected as a temple to the heroes\r\nof the Grande Armée, were all designed, in accordance with the expressed\r\nwill of the Emperor himself, in a style as Roman as the requirements of\r\neach case would permit. All these monuments, begun between 1806 and\r\n1809, were completed after the Restoration. The +Arch+ of the\r\n+Carrousel+ is a close copy of Roman models; that of the +Étoile+ (Fig.\r\n204) was a much more original design, of colossal dimensions. Its\r\nadmirable proportions, simple composition and striking sculptures give\r\nit a place among the noblest creations of its class. The +Madeleine+\r\n(Fig. 205), externally a Roman Corinthian temple of the largest size,\r\npresents internally an almost Byzantine conception with the three\r\npendentive domes that vault its vast nave, but all the details are\r\nRoman. However suitable for a pantheon or mausoleum, it seems strangely\r\ninappropriate as a design for a Christian church. To these monuments\r\nshould be added the +Bourse+ or Exchange, by _Brongniart_, heavy in\r\nspite of its Corinthian peristyle, and the river front of the +Corps\r\nLégislatif+ or Palais Bourbon, by _Poyet_, the only extant example of a\r\ndodecastyle portico with a pediment. All of these designs are\r\ncharacterized by great elegance of detail and excellence of execution,\r\nand however inappropriate in style to modern uses, they add immensely to\r\nthe splendor of the French capital. Unquestionably no feature can take\r\nthe place of a Greek or Roman colonnade as an embellishment for broad\r\navenues and open squares, or as the termination of an architectural\r\nvista.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 205.--THE MADELEINE, PARIS.]\r\n\r\nThe Greek revival took little hold of the Parisian imagination. Its\r\nforms were too cold, too precise and fixed, too intractable to modern\r\nrequirements to appeal to the French taste. It counts but one notable\r\nmonument, the church of +St. Vincent de Paul+, by _Hittorff_, who sought\r\nto apply to this design the principles of Greek external polychromy; but\r\nthe frescoes and ornaments failed to withstand the Parisian climate, and\r\nwere finally erased. The Néo-Grec movement already referred to,\r\ninitiated by Duc, Duban, and Labrouste about 1830, aimed only to\r\nintroduce into modern design the spirit and refinement, the purity and\r\ndelicacy of Greek art, not its forms (Fig. 206). Its chief monuments\r\nwere the remodelling, by _Duc_, of the +Palais de Justice+, of which the\r\nnew west façade is the most striking single feature; the beautiful\r\n+Library of the École des Beaux-Arts+, by _Duban_; the library of +Ste.\r\nGenéviève+, by _Labrouste_, in which a long façade is treated without a\r\npilaster or column, simple arches over a massive basement forming the\r\ndominant motive, while in the interior a system of iron construction\r\nwith glazed domes controls the design; and the commemorative +Colonne\r\nJuillet+, by Duc, the most elegant and appropriate of all modern\r\nmemorial columns. All these buildings, begun between 1830 and 1850 and\r\ncompleted at various dates, are distinguished by a remarkable purity and\r\nfreedom of conception and detail, quite unfettered by the artificial\r\ntrammels of the official academic style then prevalent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 206.--DOORWAY, ÉCOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS, PARIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE CLASSIC REVIVAL ELSEWHERE.+ The other countries of Europe have\r\nlittle to show in the way of imitations of classic monuments or\r\nreproductions of Roman colonnades. In Italy the church of +S. Francesco\r\ndi Paola+, at Naples, in quasi-imitation of the Pantheon at Rome, with\r\nwing-colonnades, and the +Superga+, at Turin (1706, by _Ivara_); the\r\nfaçade of the San Carlo Theatre, at Naples, and the Braccio Nuovo of the\r\nVatican (1817, by _Stern_) are the monuments which come the nearest to\r\nthe spirit and style of the Roman Revival. Yet in each of these there is\r\na large element of originality and freedom of treatment which renders\r\ndoubtful their classification as examples of that movement.\r\n\r\nA reflection of the Munich school is seen in the modern public buildings\r\nof Athens, designed in some cases by German architects, and in others by\r\nnative Greeks. The University, the Museum buildings, the Academy of Art\r\nand Science, and other edifices exemplify fairly successful efforts to\r\nadapt the severe details of classic Greek art to modern windowed\r\nstructures. They suffer somewhat from the too liberal use of stucco in\r\nplace of marble, and from the conscious affectation of an extinct style.\r\nBut they are for the most part pleasing and monumental designs, adding\r\ngreatly to the beauty of the modern city.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 207.--ST. ISAAC’S CATHEDRAL, ST. PETERSBURG.]\r\n\r\nIn Russia, during and after the reign of Peter the Great (1689-1725),\r\nthere appeared a curious mixture of styles. A style analogous to the\r\nJesuit in Italy and the Churrigueresque in Spain was generally\r\nprevalent, but it was in many cases modified by Muscovite traditions\r\ninto nondescript forms like those of the +Kremlin+, at Moscow, or the\r\nless extravagant Citadel Church and Smolnoy Monastery at St. Petersburg.\r\nAlong with this heavy and barbarous style, which prevails generally in\r\nthe numerous palaces of the capital, finished in stucco with atrocious\r\ndetails, a more severe and classical spirit is met with. The church of\r\nthe +Greek Rite+ at St. Petersburg combines a Roman domical interior\r\nwith an exterior of the Greek Doric order. The Church of +Our Lady of\r\nKazan+ has a semicircular colonnade projecting from its transept,\r\ncopying as nearly as may be the colonnades in front of St. Peter’s. But\r\nthe greatest classic monument in Russia is the +Cathedral of St. Isaac+\r\n(Fig. 207), at St. Petersburg, a vast rectangular edifice with four\r\nRoman Corinthian pedimental colonnades projecting from its faces, and a\r\ndome with a peristyle crowning the whole. Despite many defects of\r\ndetail, and the use of cast iron for the dome, which pretends to be of\r\nmarble, this is one of the most impressive churches of its size in\r\nEurope. Internally it displays the costliest materials in extraordinary\r\nprofusion, while externally its noble colonnades go far to redeem its\r\nbare attic and the material of its dome. The +Palace of the Grand Duke\r\nMichael+, which reproduces, with improvements, Gabriel’s colonnades of\r\nthe Garde Meuble at Paris on its garden front, is a nobly planned and\r\ncommendable design, agreeably contrasting with the debased architecture\r\nof many of the public buildings of the city. The Admiralty with its\r\nDoric pilasters, and the +New Museum+, by von Klenze of Munich, in a\r\nskilfully modified Greek style, with effective loggias, are the only\r\nother monuments of the classic revival in Russia which can find mention\r\nin a brief sketch like this. Both are notable and in many respects\r\nadmirable buildings, in part redeeming the vulgarity which is\r\nunfortunately so prevalent in the architecture of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe +MONUMENTS+ of the Classic Revival have been referred to in the\r\nforegoing text at sufficient length to preclude the necessity of further\r\nenumeration here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nRECENT ARCHITECTURE IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: As before, Chateau, Fergusson.

Its most striking advances have been along\r\nmechanical, scientific, and commercial lines. As a result of this\r\nmaterial progress the general conditions of mankind in civilized\r\ncountries have undoubtedly been greatly bettered. Popular education and\r\nthe printing-press have also raised the intellectual level of society,\r\nmaking learning the privilege of even the poorest. Intellectual,\r\nscientific, and commercial pursuits have thus largely absorbed those\r\nenergies which in other ages found exercise in the creation of artistic\r\nforms and objects. The critical and sceptical spirit, the spirit of\r\nutilitarianism and realism, has checked the free and general development\r\nof the creative imagination, at least in the plastic arts. While in\r\npoetry and music there have been great and noble achievements, the\r\nplastic arts, including architecture, have only of late years attained a\r\nposition at all worthy of the intellectual advancement of the times.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the artistic spirit has never been wholly crushed out by\r\nthe untoward pressure of realism and commercialism. Unfortunately it has\r\nrepeatedly been directed in wrong channels. Modern archæology and the\r\npublication of the forms of historic art by books and photographs have\r\ntoo exclusively fastened attention upon the details of extinct styles as\r\na source of inspiration in design. The whole range of historic art is\r\nbrought within our survey, and while this has on the one hand tended\r\ntoward the confusion and multiplication of styles in modern work, it has\r\non the other led to a slavish adherence to historic precedent or a\r\nliteral copying of historic forms. Modern architecture has thus\r\noscillated between the extremes of archæological servitude and of an\r\nunreasoning eclecticism. In the hands of men of inferior training the\r\nresults have been deplorable travesties of all styles, or meaningless\r\naggregations of ill-assorted forms.\r\n\r\nAn important factor in this demoralization of architectural design has\r\nbeen the development of new constructive methods, especially in the use\r\nof iron and steel. It has been impossible for modern designers, in their\r\ntreatment of style, to keep pace with the rapid changes in the\r\nstructural use of metal in architecture. The roofs of vast span, largely\r\ncomposed of glass, which modern methods of trussing have made possible\r\nfor railway stations, armories, and exhibition buildings; the immense\r\nunencumbered spaces which may be covered by them; the introduction and\r\ndevelopment, especially in the United States, of the post-and-girder\r\nsystem of construction for high buildings, in which the external walls\r\nare a mere screen or filling-in; these have revolutionized architecture\r\nso rapidly and completely that architects are still struggling and\r\ngroping to find the solution of many of the problems of style, scale,\r\nand composition which they have brought forward.\r\n\r\nWithin the last thirty years, however, architecture has, despite these\r\nnew conditions, made notable advances. The artistic emulation of\r\nrepeated international exhibitions, the multiplication of museums and\r\nschools of art, the general advance in intelligence and enlightenment,\r\nhave all contributed to this artistic progress. There appears to be more\r\nof the artistic and intellectual quality in the average architecture of\r\nthe present time, on both sides of the Atlantic, than at any previous\r\nperiod in this century. The futility of the archæological revival of\r\nextinct styles is generally recognized. New conditions are gradually\r\nprocuring the solution of the very problems they raise. Historic\r\nprecedent sits more lightly on the architect than formerly, and the\r\nessential unity of principle underlying all good design is coming to be\r\nbetter understood.[26]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: See Appendix D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+FRANCE.+ It is in France, Germany (including Austria), and England that\r\nthe architectural progress of this period in Europe has been most\r\nmarked. We have already noticed the results of the classic revivals in\r\nthese three countries. Speaking broadly, it may be said that in France\r\nthe influence of the _École des Beaux-Arts_, while it has tended to give\r\ngreater unity and consistency to the national architecture, and has\r\nexerted a powerful influence in behalf of refinement of taste and\r\ncorrectness of style, has also stood in the way of a free development of\r\nnew ideas. French architecture has throughout adhered to the principles\r\nof the Renaissance, though the style has during this century been\r\nmodified by various influences. The first of these was the Néo-Grec\r\nmovement, alluded to in the last chapter, which broke the grip of Roman\r\ntradition in matters of detail and gave greater elasticity to the\r\nnational style. Next should be mentioned the Gothic movement represented\r\nby Viollet-le-Duc, Lassus, Ballu, and their followers. Beginning about\r\n1845, it produced comparatively few notable buildings, but gave a great\r\nimpulse to the study of mediæval archæology and the restoration of\r\nmediæval monuments. The churches of Ste. Clothilde and of St. Jean de\r\nBelleville, at Paris, and the reconstruction of the Château de\r\nPierrefonds, were among its direct results. Indirectly it led to a freer\r\nand more rational treatment of constructive forms and materials than had\r\nprevailed with the academic designers. The church of +St. Augustin+, by\r\n_Baltard_, at Paris, illustrates this in its use of iron and brick for\r\nthe dome and vaulting, and the +College Chaptal+, by _E. Train_, in its\r\ndecorative treatment of brick and tile externally. The general adoption\r\nof iron for roof-trusses and for the construction of markets and similar\r\nbuildings tended further in the same direction, the +Halles Centrales+\r\nat Paris, by _Baltard_, being a notable example.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 208.--PLAN OF LOUVRE AND TUILERIES, PARIS.\r\n  A, A, _the Old Louvre, so called_; B, B, _the New Louvre._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 209.--PAVILION OF RICHELIEU, LOUVRE.]\r\n\r\n+THE SECOND EMPIRE.+ The reign of Napoleon III. (1852-70) was a period\r\nof exceptional activity, especially in Paris. The greatest monument of\r\nhis reign was the completion of the +Louvre+ and +Tuileries+, under\r\n_Visconti_ and _Lefuel_, including the remodelling of the pavilions de\r\nFlore and de Marsan. The new portions constitute the most notable\r\nexample of modern French architecture, and the manner in which the two\r\npalaces were united deserves high praise. In spite of certain defects,\r\nthis work is marked by a combination of dignity, richness, and\r\nrefinement, such as are rarely found in palace architecture (Figs. 208,\r\n209). The +New Opera+ (1863-75), by _Garnier_ (d.  1898), stands next to\r\nthe Louvre in importance as a national monument. It is by far the most\r\nsumptuous building for amusement in existence, but in purity of detail\r\nand in the balance and restraint of its design it is inferior to the\r\nwork of Visconti and Lefuel (Fig. 210). To this reign belong the Palais\r\nde l’Industrie, by _Viel_, built for the exhibition of 1855, and several\r\ngreat railway stations (Gare du Nord, by Hitorff, Gare de l’Est, Gare\r\nd’Orléans, etc.), in which the modern French version of the Renaissance\r\nwas applied with considerable skill to buildings largely constructed of\r\niron and glass. Town halls and theatres were erected in great numbers,\r\nand in decorative works like fountains and monuments the French were\r\nparticularly successful. The fountains of +St. Michel+, Cuvier, and\r\nMolière, at Paris, and of +Longchamps+, at Marseilles (Fig. 211),\r\nillustrate the fertility of resource and elegance of detailed treatment\r\nof the French in this department. Mention should also here be made of\r\nthe extensive enterprises carried out by Napoleon III., in rectifying\r\nand embellishing the street-plan of Paris by new avenues and squares on\r\na vast scale, adding greatly to the monumental splendor of the city.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 210.--GRAND STAIRCASE OF THE OPERA, PARIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 211.--FOUNTAIN OF LONGCHAMPS, MARSEILLES.]\r\n\r\n+THE REPUBLIC.+ Since the disasters of 1870 a number of important\r\nstructures have been erected, and French architecture has shown a\r\nremarkable vitality and flexibility under new conditions. Its\r\nproductions have in general been marked by a refined taste and a\r\nconspicuous absence of eccentricity and excess; but it has for the most\r\npart trodden in well-worn paths. The most notable recent monuments are,\r\nin church architecture, the +Sacré-Cœur+, at Montmartre, by _Abadie_,\r\na votive church inspired from the Franco-Byzantine style of Aquitania;\r\nin civil architecture the new +Hôtel de Ville+, at Paris, by _Ballu_ and\r\n_Déperthes_, recalling the original structure destroyed by the Commune,\r\nbut in reality an original creation of great merit; in scholastic\r\narchitecture the new École de Médecine, and the new +Sorbonne+, by\r\n_Nénot_, and in other branches of the art the metal-and-glass exhibition\r\nbuildings of 1878, 1889, and 1900. In the last of these the striving for\r\noriginality and the effort to discard traditional forms reached the\r\nextreme, although accompanied by much very clever detail and a masterly\r\nuse of color-decoration. To these should be added many noteworthy\r\ntheatres, town-halls, court-houses, and _préfectures_ in provincial\r\ncities, and commemorative columns and monuments almost without number.\r\nIn street architecture there is now much more variety and originality\r\nthan formerly, especially in private houses, and the reaction against\r\nthe orders and against traditional methods of design has of late been\r\ngrowing stronger. The chief excellence of modern French architecture\r\nlies in its rational planning, monumental spirit, and refinement of\r\ndetail (Fig. 212).\r\n\r\n\r\n+GERMANY AND AUSTRIA.+ German architecture has been more affected during\r\nthe past fifty years by the archæological spirit than has the French.\r\nA pronounced mediæval revival partly accompanied, partly followed the\r\nGreek revival in Germany, and produced a number of churches and a few\r\nsecular buildings in the basilican, Romanesque, and Gothic styles.These\r\nare less interesting than those in the Greek style, because mediæval\r\nforms are even more foreign to modern needs than the classic, being\r\ncompatible only with systems of design and construction which are no\r\nlonger practicable. At Munich the Auekirche, by _Ohlmuller_, in an\r\nattenuated Gothic style; the Byzantine Ludwigskirche, and _Ziebland’s_\r\nBasilica following Early Christian models; the Basilica by _Hübsch _, at\r\nBulach, and the Votive Church at Vienna (1856) by H. Von Ferstel\r\n(1828-1883) are notable neo-mediæval monuments. The last-named church\r\nmay be classed with Ste. Clothilde at Paris (see p. 371), and St.\r\nPatrick’s Cathedral at New York, all three being of approximately the\r\nsame size and general style, recalling St. Ouen at Rouen. They are\r\ncorrect and elaborate, but more or less cold and artificial.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 212.--MUSÉE GALLIÉRA, PARIS.]\r\n\r\nMore successful are many of the German theatres and concert halls, in\r\nwhich Renaissance and classic forms have been freely used. In several of\r\nthese the attempt has been made to express by the external form the\r\ncurvilinear plan of the auditorium, as in the +Dresden Theatre+, by\r\n_Semper_ (1841; Fig. 213), the theatre at Carlsruhe, by Hübsch, and the\r\ndouble winter-summer +Victoria Theatre+, at Berlin, by _Titz_. But the\r\npractical and æsthetic difficulties involved in this treatment have\r\ncaused its general abandonment. The +Opera House+ at Vienna, by\r\n_Siccardsburg_ and _Van der Null_ (1861-69), is rectangular in its\r\nmasses, and but for a certain triviality of detail would rank among the\r\nmost successful buildings of its kind. The new +Burgtheater+ in the same\r\ncity is a more elaborately ornate structure in Renaissance style,\r\nsomewhat florid and overdone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 213.--THEATRE AT DRESDEN.]\r\n\r\nModern German architecture is at its best in academic and residential\r\nbuildings. The +Bauschule+, at Berlin, by Schinkel, in which brick is\r\nused in a rational and dignified design without the orders; the\r\nPolytechnic School, at Zürich, by Semper; university buildings, and\r\nespecially buildings for technical instruction, at Carlsruhe, Stuttgart,\r\nStrasburg, Vienna, and other cities, show a monumental treatment of the\r\nexterior and of the general distribution, combined with a careful study\r\nof practical requirements. In administrative buildings the Germans have\r\nhardly been as successful; and the new +Parliament House+, at Berlin, by\r\n_Wallot_, in spite of its splendor and costliness, is heavy and\r\nunsatisfactory in detail. The larger cities, especially Berlin, contain\r\nmany excellent examples of house architecture, mostly in the Renaissance\r\nstyle, sufficiently monumental in design, though usually, like most\r\nGerman work, inclined to heaviness of detail. The too free use of stucco\r\nin imitation of stone is also open to criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 214.--BLOCK OF DWELLINGS (MARIE-THERESIENHOF),\r\n  VIENNA.]\r\n\r\n+VIENNA.+ During the last thirty years Vienna has undergone a\r\ntransformation which has made it the rival of Paris as a stately\r\ncapital. The remodelling of the central portion, the creation of a\r\nseries of magnificent boulevards and squares, and the grouping of the\r\nchief state and municipal buildings about these upon a monumental scheme\r\nof arrangement, have given the city an unusual aspect of splendor. Among\r\nthe most important monuments in this group are the +Parliament House+,\r\nby Hansen (see p. 360), and the +Town Hall+, by _Schmidt_. This latter\r\nis a Neo-Gothic edifice of great size and pretentiousness, but strangely\r\nthin and meagre in detail, and quite out of harmony with its\r\nsurroundings. The university and museums are massive piles in\r\nRenaissance style; and it is the Renaissance rather than the classic or\r\nGothic revival which prevails throughout the new city. The great blocks\r\nof residences and apartments (Fig. 214) which line its streets are\r\nhighly ornate in their architecture, but for the most part done in\r\nstucco, which fails after all to give the aspect of solidity and\r\ndurability which it seeks to counterfeit.\r\n\r\nThe city of +Buda-Pesth+ has also in recent years undergone a phenomenal\r\ntransformation of a similar nature to that effected in Vienna, but it\r\npossesses fewer monuments of conspicuous architectural interest. The\r\n+Synagogue+ is the most noted of these, a rich and pleasing edifice of\r\nbrick in a modified Hispano-Moresque style.\r\n\r\n\r\n+GREAT BRITAIN.+ During the closing years of the Anglo-Greek\r\nstyle a coterie of enthusiastic students of British mediæval\r\nmonuments--archæologists rather than architects--initiated a movement\r\nfor the revival of the national Gothic architecture. The first fruits\r\nof this movement, led by Pugin, Brandon, Rickman, and others (about\r\n1830-40), were seen in countless pseudo-Gothic structures in which\r\nthe pointed arches, buttresses, and clustered shafts of mediæval\r\narchitecture were imitated or parodied according to the designer’s\r\nability, with frequent misapprehension of their proper use or\r\nsignificance. This unintelligent misapplication of Gothic forms was,\r\nhowever, confined to the earlier stages of the movement. With increasing\r\nlight and experience came a more correct and consistent use of the\r\nmediæval styles, dominated by the same spirit of archæological\r\ncorrectness which had produced the _classicismo_ of the Late Renaissance\r\nin Italy. This spirit, stimulated by extensive enterprises in the\r\nrestoration of the great mediæval monuments of the United Kingdom, was\r\nfatal to any free and original development of the style along new lines.\r\nBut it rescued church architecture from the utter meanness and\r\ndebasement into which it had fallen, and established a standard of taste\r\nwhich reacted on all other branches of design.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 215.--HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, WESTMINSTER,\r\n  LONDON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 216.--ASSIZE COURTS, MANCHESTER. DETAIL.]\r\n\r\n+THE VICTORIAN GOTHIC.+ Between 1850 and 1870 the striving after\r\narchæological correctness gave place to the more rational effort to\r\nadapt Gothic principles to modern requirements, instead of merely\r\ncopying extinct styles. This effort, prosecuted by a number of\r\narchitects of great intelligence, culture, and earnestness (Sir Gilbert\r\nScott, George Edmund Street, William Burges, and others), resulted in a\r\nnumber of extremely interesting buildings. Chief among these in size and\r\ncost stand the +Parliament Houses+ at Westminster, by _Sir Charles\r\nBarry_ (begun 1839), in the Perpendicular style. This immense structure\r\n(Fig. 215), imposing in its simple masses and refined in its carefully\r\nstudied detail, is the most successful monument of the Victorian Gothic\r\nstyle. It suffers, however, from the want of proper relation of scale\r\nbetween its decorative elements and the vast proportions of the edifice,\r\nwhich belittle its component elements. It cannot, on the whole, be\r\nclaimed as a successful vindication of the claims of the promoters of\r\nthe style as to the adaptability of Gothic forms to structures planned\r\nand built after the modern fashion. The +Assize Courts+ at Manchester\r\n(Fig. 216), the +New Museum+ at Oxford, the gorgeous +Albert Memorial+\r\nat London, by _Scott_, and the +New Law Courts+ at London, by _Street_,\r\nare all conspicuous illustrations of the same truth. They are\r\nconscientious, carefully studied designs in good taste, and yet wholly\r\nunsuited in style to their purpose. They are like labored and scholarly\r\nverse in a foreign tongue, correct in form and language, but lacking the\r\nnaturalness and charm of true and unfettered inspiration. A later essay\r\nof the same sort in a slightly different field is the +Natural History\r\nMuseum+ at South Kensington, by _Waterhouse_ (1879), an imposing\r\nbuilding in a modified Romanesque style (Fig. 217).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 217.--NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, LONDON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+OTHER WORKS.+ The Victorian Gothic style responded to no deep and\r\ngeneral movement of the popular taste, and, like the Anglo-Greek style,\r\nwas doomed to failure from the inherent incongruity between modern needs\r\nand mediæval forms. Within the last twenty years there has been a quite\r\ngeneral return to Renaissance principles, and the result is seen in a\r\nlarge number of town-halls, exchanges, museums, and colleges, in which\r\nRenaissance forms, with and without the orders, have been treated with\r\nincreasing freedom and skilful adaptation to the materials and special\r\nrequirements of each case. The Albert Memorial Hall (1863, by General\r\nScott) may be taken as an early instance of this movement, and the\r\n+Imperial Institute+ (Colonial offices), by Collcutt, and Oxford Town\r\nHall, by Aston Webb, as among its latest manifestations. In domestic\r\narchitecture the so-called Queen Anne style has been much in vogue, as\r\npractised by Norman Shaw, Ernest George, and others. It is really a\r\nmodern style, originating in the imitation of the modified Palladian\r\nstyle as used in the brick architecture of Queen Anne’s time, but freely\r\nand often artistically altered to meet modern tastes and needs.\r\n\r\nIn its emancipation from the mistaken principles of archæological\r\nrevivals, and in its evidences of improved taste and awakened\r\noriginality, contemporary British architecture shows promise of good\r\nthings to come. It is still inferior to the French in the monumental\r\nquality, in technical resource and refinement of decorative detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE.+ In other European countries recent architecture\r\nshows in general increasing freedom and improved good taste, but both\r\nits opportunities and its performance have been nowhere else as\r\nconspicuous as in France, Germany, and England. The costly Bourse and\r\nthe vast but overloaded Palais de Justice at Brussels, by _Polaert_, are\r\nneither of them conspicuous for refined and cultivated taste. A few\r\nbuildings of note in Switzerland, Russia, and Greece might find mention\r\nin a more extended review of architecture, but cannot here even be\r\nenumerated. In Italy, especially at Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin,\r\nthere has been a great activity in building since 1870, but with the\r\nexception of the +Monument to Victor Emmanuel+ and the National Museum\r\nat Rome, monumental arcades and passages at Milan and Naples, and _Campi\r\nSanti_ or monumental cemeteries at Bologna, Genoa, and one or two other\r\nplaces, there has been almost nothing of real importance built in Italy\r\nof late years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: As before, Fergusson, Statham.

The colonizing nation, carrying into its new\r\n_habitat_ the tastes and practices of a long-established civilization,\r\nmodifies these only with the utmost reluctance, under the absolute\r\ncompulsion of new conditions. When the new home is virgin soil,\r\ndestitute of cultivation, government, or civilized inhabitants, the\r\naccompaniments and activities of civilization introduced by the\r\ncolonists manifest themselves at first in curious contrast to the\r\nprimitive surroundings. The struggle between organized life and chaos,\r\nthe laborious subjugation of nature to the requirements of our complex\r\nmodern life, for a considerable period absorb the energies of the\r\ncolonists. The amenities of culture, the higher intellectual life, the\r\nrefinements of art can, during this period, receive little attention.\r\nMeanwhile a new national character is being formed; the people are\r\nundergoing the moral training upon which their subsequent achievements\r\nmust depend. With the conquest of brute nature, however, and the gradual\r\nemergence of a more cultivated class, with the growth of commerce and\r\nwealth and the consequent increase of leisure, the humanities find more\r\nplace in the colonial life. The fine arts appear in scattered centres\r\ndetermined by peculiarly favorable conditions. For a long time they\r\nretain the impress, and seek to reproduce the forms, of the art of the\r\nmother country. But new conditions impose a new development. Maturing\r\ncommerce with other lands brings in foreign influences, to which the\r\nstill unformed colonial art is peculiarly susceptible. Only with\r\npolitical and commercial independence, fully developed internal\r\nresources, and a high national culture do the arts finally attain, as it\r\nwere, their majority, and enter upon a truly national growth.\r\n\r\nThese facts are abundantly illustrated by the architectural history of\r\nthe United States. The only one among the British colonies to attain\r\npolitical independence, it is the only one among them whose architecture\r\nhas as yet entered upon an independent course of development, and this\r\nonly within the last twenty-five or thirty years. Nor has even this\r\ndevelopment produced as yet a distinctive local style. It has, however,\r\noriginated new constructive methods, new types of buildings, and a\r\ndistinctively American treatment of the composition and the masses; the\r\ndecorative details being still, for the most part, derived from historic\r\nprecedents. The architecture of the other British colonies has retained\r\nits provincial character, though producing from time to time individual\r\nworks of merit. In South America and Mexico the only buildings of\r\nimportance are Spanish, French, or German in style, according to the\r\nnationality of the architects employed. The following sketch of American\r\narchitecture refers, therefore, exclusively to its development in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n+FORMATIVE PERIOD.+ Buildings in stone were not undertaken by the early\r\nEnglish colonists. The more important structures in the Southern and\r\nDutch colonies were of brick imported from Europe. Wood was, however,\r\nthe material most commonly employed, especially in New England, and its\r\nuse determined in large measure the form and style of the colonial\r\narchitecture. There was little or no striving for architectural elegance\r\nuntil well into the eighteenth century, when Wren’s influence asserted\r\nitself in a modest way in the Middle and Southern colonies. The very\r\nsimple and unpretentious town-hall at Williamsburg, Va., and St.\r\nMichael’s, Charleston, are attributed to him; but the most that can be\r\nsaid for these, as for the brick churches and manors of Virginia\r\nprevious to 1725, is that they are simple in design and pleasing in\r\nproportion, without special architectural elegance. The same is true of\r\nthe wooden houses and churches of New England of the period, except that\r\nthey are even simpler in design.\r\n\r\nFrom 1725 to 1775 increased population and wealth along the coast\r\nbrought about a great advance in architecture, especially in churches\r\nand in the dwellings of the wealthy. During this period was developed\r\nthe _Colonial style_, based on that of the reigns of Anne and the first\r\ntwo Georges in England, and in church architecture on the models set by\r\nWren and Gibbs. All the details were, however, freely modified by the\r\ngeneral employment of wood. The scarcity of architects trained in Old\r\nWorld traditions contributed to this departure from classic precision of\r\nform. The style, especially in interior design, reflected the cultured\r\ntaste of the colonial aristocracy in its refined treatment of the\r\nwoodwork. But there was little or no architecture of a truly monumental\r\ncharacter. Edifices of stone were singularly few, and administrative\r\nbuildings were small and modest, owing to insufficient grants from the\r\nCrown, as well as to the poverty of the colonies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 218.--CHRIST CHURCH, PHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\nThe churches of this period include a number of interesting designs,\r\nespecially pleasing in the forms of their steeples. The “+Old South+” at\r\nBoston (now a museum), Trinity at Newport, and +St. Paul’s+ at New\r\nYork--one of the few built of stone (1764)--are good examples of the\r\nstyle. +Christ Church+ at Philadelphia (1727-35, by Dr. Kearsley) is\r\nanother example, historically as well as architecturally interesting\r\n(Fig. 218); and there are scores of other churches almost equally\r\nnoteworthy, scattered through New England, Maryland, Virginia, and the\r\nMiddle States.\r\n\r\n\r\n+DWELLINGS.+ These reflect better than the churches the varying tastes\r\nof the different colonies. Maryland and Virginia abound in fine brick\r\nmanor-houses, set amid extensive grounds walled in and entered through\r\niron gates of artistic design. The interior finish of these houses was\r\noften elaborate in conception and admirably executed. Westover (1737),\r\nCarter’s Grove (1737) in Virginia, and the Harwood and Hammond Houses at\r\nAnnapolis, Md. (1770), are examples. The majority of the New England\r\nhouses were of wood, more compact in plan, more varied and picturesque\r\nin design than those of the South, but wanting somewhat of their\r\nstateliness. The interior finish of wainscot, cornices, stairs, and\r\nmantelpieces shows, however, the same general style, in a skilful and\r\nartistic adaptation of classic forms to the slender proportions of wood\r\nconstruction. Externally the orders appear in porches and in colossal\r\npilasters, with well designed entablatures, and windows of Italian\r\nmodel. The influence of the Adams and Sheraton furniture is doubtless to\r\nbe seen in these quaint and often charming versions of classic motives.\r\nThe Hancock House, Boston (of stone, demolished); the Sherburne House,\r\nPortsmouth (1730); Craigie House, Cambridge (1757, Fig. 219); and\r\nRumford House, North Woburn (Mass.), are typical examples.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 219.--CRAIGIE (LONGFELLOW) HOUSE, CAMBRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nIn the Middle States architectural activity was chiefly centred in\r\nPhiladelphia and New York, and one or two other towns, where a number of\r\nmanor-houses, still extant, attest the wealth and taste of the time. It\r\nis noticeable that the veranda or piazza was confined to the Southern\r\nStates, but that the climate seems to have had little influence on the\r\nforms of roofs. These were gambrelled, hipped, gabled, or flat, alike in\r\nthe North and South, according to individual taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PUBLIC BUILDINGS.+ Of public and monumental architecture this period\r\nhas little to show. Large cities did not exist; New York, Boston, and\r\nPhiladelphia were hardly more than overgrown villages. The public\r\nbuildings--court-houses and town-halls--were modest and inexpensive\r\nstructures. The Old State House and Faneuil Hall at Boston, the Town\r\nHall at Newport (R.I.), and Independence Hall at Philadelphia, the best\r\nknown of those now extant, are not striking architecturally. Monumental\r\ndesign was beyond the opportunities and means of the colonies. It was in\r\ntheir churches, all of moderate size, and in their dwellings that the\r\ncolonial builders achieved their greatest successes; and these works are\r\nquaint, charming, and refined, rather than impressive or imposing.\r\n\r\nTo the latter part of the colonial period belong a number of interesting\r\nbuildings which remain as monuments of Spanish rule in California,\r\nFlorida, and the Southwest. The old Fort S. Marco, now Fort Marion\r\n(1656-1756), and the Catholic cathedral (1793; after the fire of 1887\r\nrebuilt in its original form with the original façade uninjured), both\r\nat St. Augustine, Fla.; the picturesque buildings of the California\r\nmissions (mainly 1769-1800), the majority of them now in ruins;\r\nscattered Spanish churches in California, Arizona, and New Mexico, and a\r\nfew unimportant secular buildings, display among their modern and\r\nAmerican settings a picturesque and interesting Spanish aspect and\r\ncharacter, though from the point of view of architectural detail they\r\nrepresent merely a crude phase of the Churrigueresque style.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 220.--NATIONAL CAPITOL, WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\n+EARLY REPUBLICAN PERIOD.+ Between the Revolution and the War of 1812,\r\nunder the new conditions of independence and self-government,\r\narchitecture took on a more monumental character. Buildings for the\r\nState and National administrations were erected with the rapidly\r\nincreasing resources of the country. Stone was more generally used;\r\ncolonnades, domes, and cupolas or bell-towers, were adopted as\r\nindispensable features of civic architecture. In church-building the\r\nWren-Gibbs type continued to prevail, but with greater correctness of\r\nclassic forms. The gambrel roof tended to disappear from the houses of\r\nthis period, and there was some decline in the refinement and delicacy\r\nof the details of architecture. The influence of the Louis XVI. style is\r\ntraceable in many cases, as in the New York City Hall (1803-12, by\r\n_McComb_ and _Mangin_), one of the very best designs of the time, and in\r\nthe delicate stucco-work and interior finish of many houses, The\r\noriginal +Capitol+ at Washington--the central portion of the present\r\nedifice--by _Thornton_, _Hallet_, and _B. H. Latrobe_ (1793-1830; Fig.\r\n220), the +State House+ at Boston (1795, by _Bulfinch_), and the\r\nUniversity of Virginia, at Charlotteville, by _Thomas Jefferson_ (1817;\r\nrecently destroyed in part by fire), are the most interesting examples\r\nof the classic tendencies of this period. Their freedom from the rococo\r\nvulgarities generally prevalent at the time in Europe is noticeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 221.--CUSTOM HOUSE, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\n+THE CLASSIC REVIVAL.+ The influence of the classic revivals of Europe\r\nbegan to appear before the close of this period, and reached its\r\nculmination about 1830-40. It left its impress most strongly on our\r\nFederal architecture, although it invaded domestic architecture,\r\nproducing countless imitations, in brick and wooden houses, of Grecian\r\ncolonnades and porticos. One of its first-fruits was the White House, or\r\nExecutive Mansion, at Washington, by _Hoban_ (1792), recalling the large\r\nEnglish country houses of the time. The +Treasury+ and +Patent Office+\r\nbuildings at Washington, the Philadelphia Mint, the +Sub-treasury+ and\r\n+Custom House+ at New York (the latter erected originally for a bank;\r\nFig. 221), and the +Boston Custom House+ are among the important Federal\r\nbuildings of this period. Several State capitols were also erected under\r\nthe same influence; and the Marine Exchange and +Girard College+ at\r\nPhiladelphia should also be mentioned as conspicuous examples of the\r\npseudo-Greek style. The last-named building is a Corinthian dormitory,\r\nits tiers of small windows contrasting strangely with its white marble\r\ncolumns. These classic buildings were solidly and carefully constructed,\r\nbut lacked the grace, cheerfulness, and appropriateness of earlier\r\nbuildings. The Capitol at Washington was during this period greatly\r\nenlarged by terminal wings with fine Corinthian porticos, of Roman\r\nrather than Greek design. The +Dome+, by _Walters_, was not added until\r\n1858-73; it is a successful and harmonious composition, nobly completing\r\nthe building. Unfortunately, it is an afterthought, built of iron\r\npainted to simulate marble, the substructure being inadequate to support\r\na dome of masonry. The Italian or Roman style which it exemplified, in\r\ntime superseded the less tractable Greek style.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE WAR PERIOD.+ The period from 1850 to 1876 was one of intense\r\npolitical activity and rapid industrial progress. The former culminated\r\nin the terrible upheaval of the civil war; the latter in the completion\r\nof the Pacific Railroad (1869) and a remarkable development of the\r\nmining resources and manufactures of the country. It was a period of\r\nfeverish commercial activity, but of artistic stagnation, and witnessed\r\nthe erection of but few buildings of architectural importance. A number\r\nof State capitols, city halls and churches, of considerable size and\r\ncost but of inferior design, attest the decline of public taste and\r\narchitectural skill during these years. The huge Municipal Building at\r\nPhiladelphia and the still unfinished Capitol at Albany are full of\r\nerrors of planning and detail which twenty-five years of elaboration\r\nhave failed to correct. Next to the dome of the Capitol at Washington,\r\ncompleted during this period, of which it is the most signal\r\narchitectural achievement, its most notable monument was the +St.\r\nPatrick’s Cathedral+ at New York, by _Renwick_; a Gothic church which,\r\nif somewhat cold and mechanical in detail, is a stately and\r\nwell-considered design. Its west front and spires (completed 1886) are\r\nparticularly successful. Trinity Church (1843, by _Upjohn_) and Grace\r\nChurch (1840, by Renwick), though of earlier date, should be classed\r\nwith this cathedral as worthy examples of modern Gothic design. Indeed,\r\nthe churches designed in this style by a few thoroughly trained\r\narchitects during this period are the most creditable and worthy among\r\nits lesser productions. In general an undiscriminating eclecticism of\r\nstyle prevailed, unregulated by sober taste or technical training. The\r\nFederal buildings by _Mullett_ were monuments of perverted design in a\r\nheavy and inartistic rendering of French Renaissance motives. The New\r\nYork Post Office and the State, Army and Navy Department building at\r\nWashington are examples of this style.\r\n\r\n\r\n+THE ARTISTIC AWAKENING.+ Between 1870 and 1880 a remarkable series of\r\nevents exercised a powerful influence on the artistic life of the United\r\nStates. Two terrible conflagrations in Chicago (1871) and Boston (1872)\r\ngave unexampled opportunities for architectural improvement and greatly\r\nstimulated the public interest in the art. The feverish and abnormal\r\nindustrial activity which followed the war and the rapid growth of the\r\nparvenu spirit were checked by the disastrous “panic” of 1873. With the\r\ncompletion of the Pacific railways and the settlement of new communities\r\nin the West, industrial prosperity, when it returned, was established on\r\na firmer basis. An extraordinary expansion of travel to Europe began to\r\ndisseminate the seeds of artistic culture throughout the country. The\r\nsuccessful establishment of schools of architecture in Boston (1866) and\r\nother cities, and the opening or enlargement of art museums in New York,\r\nBoston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Detroit, Milwaukee, and elsewhere,\r\nstimulated the artistic awakening which now manifested itself. In\r\narchitecture the personal influence of two men, trained in the Paris\r\nÉcole des Beaux-Arts, was especially felt--of _R. M. Hunt_ (1827-95)\r\nthrough his words and deeds quite as much as through his works; and of\r\n_H. H. Richardson_ (1828-86) predominantly through his works. These two\r\nmen, with others of less fame but of high ideals and thorough culture,\r\ndid much to elevate architecture as an art in the public esteem. To all\r\nthese influences new force was added by the Centennial Exhibition at\r\nPhiladelphia (1876). Here for the first time the American people were\r\nbrought into contact, in their own land, with the products of European\r\nand Oriental art. It was to them an artistic revelation, whose results\r\nwere prompt and far-reaching. Beginning first in the domain of\r\nindustrial and decorative art, its stimulating influence rapidly\r\nextended to painting and architecture, and with permanent consequences.\r\nAmerican students began to throng the centres of Old World art, while\r\nthe setting of higher standards of artistic excellence at home, and the\r\ndevelopment of important art-industries, were other fruits of this\r\nartistic awakening. The recent Columbian Exhibition at Chicago (1893),\r\nits latest and most important manifestation, has added a new impulse to\r\nthe movement, especially in architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 222.--TRINITY CHURCH, BOSTON.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 223.--LIBRARY AT WOBURN, MASS.]\r\n\r\n+STYLE IN RECENT ARCHITECTURE.+ The rapid increase in the number of\r\nAmerican architects trained in Paris or under the indirect influence of\r\nthe École des Beaux-Arts has been an important factor in recent\r\narchitectural progress. Yet it has by no means imposed the French\r\nacademic formulæ upon American architecture. The conditions, materials,\r\nand constructive processes here prevailing, and above all the\r\neclecticism of the public taste, have prevented this. The French\r\ninfluence is perceived rather in a growing appreciation of monumental\r\ndesign in the planning, composition, and setting of buildings, than in\r\nany direct imitation of French models. The Gothic revival which\r\nprevailed more or less widely from 1840 to 1875, as already noticed, and\r\nof which the +State Capitol+ at Hartford (Conn.; 1875-78), and the +Fine\r\nArts Museum+ at Boston, were among the last important products, was\r\ngenerally confined to church architecture, for which Gothic forms are\r\nstill largely employed, as in the Protestant +Cathedral+ of +All Saints+\r\nnow building at Albany (N.Y.), by an English architect. For the most\r\npart the works of the last twenty years show a more or less judicious\r\neclecticism, the choice of style being determined partly by the person\r\nand training of the designer, partly by the nature of the building. The\r\npowerfully conceived works of Richardson, in a free version of the\r\nFrench Romanesque, for a time exercised a wide influence, especially\r\namong the younger architects. +Trinity Church+, Boston (Fig. 222), his\r\nearliest important work; many public libraries and business buildings,\r\nand finally the impressive +County Buildings+ at Pittsburgh (Pa.), all\r\ntreated in this style, are admirable rather for the strong individuality\r\nof their designer, displayed in their vigorous composition, than on\r\naccount of the historic style he employed (Fig. 223). Yet it appeared in\r\nhis hands so flexible and effective that it was widely imitated. But if\r\neasy to use, it is most difficult to use well; its forms are too massive\r\nfor ordinary purposes, and in the hands of inferior designers it was so\r\noften travestied that it has now lost its wide popularity. While a\r\nnumber of able architects have continued to use it effectively in\r\necclesiastical, civic, and even commercial architecture, it is being\r\ngenerally superseded by various forms of the Renaissance. Here also a\r\nwide eclecticism prevails, the works of the same architect often varying\r\nfrom the gayest Francis I. designs in domestic architecture, or free\r\nadaptations of Quattrocento details for theatres and street\r\narchitecture, to the most formal classicism in colossal\r\nexhibition-buildings, museums, libraries, and the like. Meanwhile there\r\nare many more or less successful ventures in other historic styles\r\napplied to public and private edifices. Underlying this apparent\r\nconfusion, almost anarchy in the use of historic styles, the careful\r\nobserver may detect certain tendencies crystallizing into definite form.\r\nNew materials and methods of construction, increased attention to\r\ndetail, a growing sense of monumental requirements, even the development\r\nof the elevator as a substitute for the grand staircase, are leaving\r\ntheir mark on the planning, the proportions, and the artistic\r\ncomposition of American buildings, irrespective of the styles used. The\r\nart is with us in a state of transition, and open to criticism in many\r\nrespects; but it appears to be full of life and promise for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 224.--“TIMES” BUILDING, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\n+COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS.+ This class of edifices has in our great cities\r\ndeveloped wholly new types, which have taken shape under four imperative\r\ninfluences. These are the demand for fire-proof construction, the demand\r\nfor well-lighted offices, the introduction of elevators, and the\r\nconcentration of business into limited areas, within which land has\r\nbecome inordinately costly. These causes have led to the erection of\r\nbuildings of excessive height (Fig. 224); the more recent among them\r\nconstructed with a framework of iron or steel columns and beams, the\r\nvisible walls being a mere filling-in. To render a building of twenty\r\nstories attractive to the eye, especially when built on an irregular\r\nsite, is a difficult problem, of which a wholly satisfactory solution\r\nhas yet to be found. There have been, however, some notable achievements\r\nin this line, in most of which the principle has been clearly recognized\r\nthat a lofty building should have a well-marked basement or pedestal and\r\na somewhat ornate crowning portion or capital, the intervening stories\r\nserving as a die or shaft and being treated with comparative simplicity.\r\nThe difficulties of scale and of handling one hundred and fifty to three\r\nhundred windows of uniform style have been surmounted with conspicuous\r\nskill (+American Surety Building+ and Broadway Chambers, New York; Ames\r\nBuilding, Boston; Carnegie Building, Pittsburgh; Union Trust, St.\r\nLouis). In some cases, especially in Chicago and the Middle West, the\r\nmetallic framework is suggested by slender piers between the windows,\r\nrising uninterrupted from the basement to the top story. In others,\r\nespecially in New York and the East, the walls are treated as in\r\nordinary masonry buildings. The Chicago school is marked by a more\r\nutilitarian and unconventional treatment, with results which are often\r\nextremely bold and effective, but rarely as pleasing to the eye as those\r\nattained by the more conservative Eastern school. In the details of\r\nAmerican office-buildings every variety of style is to be met with; but\r\nthe Romanesque and the Renaissance, freely modified, predominate. The\r\ntendency towards two or three well-marked types in the external\r\ncomposition of these buildings, as above suggested, promises, however,\r\nthe evolution of a style in which the historic origin of the details\r\nwill be a secondary matter. Certain Chicago architects have developed an\r\noriginal treatment of architectural forms by exaggerating some of the\r\nstructural lines, by suppressing the mouldings and more familiar\r\nhistoric forms, and by the free use of flat surface ornament. The\r\nSchiller, Auditorium, and Fisher Buildings, all at Chicago, Guaranty\r\nBuilding, Buffalo, and Majestic Building, Detroit, are examples of this\r\npersonal style, which illustrates the untrammelled freedom of the art in\r\na land without traditions.[27]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: See Appendix, D and E.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 225.--COUNTRY HOUSE, MASSACHUSETTS.]\r\n\r\n+DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.+ It is in this field that the most\r\ncharacteristic and original phases of American architecture are to be\r\nmet with, particularly in rural and suburban residences. In these the\r\npeculiar requirements of our varying climates and of American domestic\r\nlife have been studied and in large measure met with great frankness and\r\nartistic appreciation. The broad staircase-hall, serving often as a sort\r\nof family sitting-room, the piazza, and a picturesque massing of steep\r\nroofs, have been the controlling factors in the evolution of two or\r\nthree general types which appear in infinite variations. The material\r\nmost used is wood, but this has had less influence in the determination\r\nof form than might have been expected. The artlessness of the planning,\r\nwhich is arranged to afford the maximum of convenience rather than to\r\nconform to any traditional type, has been the element of greatest\r\nartistic success. It has resulted in exteriors which are the natural\r\noutgrowth of the interior arrangements, frankly expressed, without\r\naffectation of style (Fig. 225). The resulting picturesqueness has,\r\nhowever, in many cases been treated as an end instead of an incidental\r\nresult, and the affectation of picturesqueness has in such designs\r\nbecome as detrimental as any affectation of style. In the internal\r\ntreatment of American houses there has also been a notable artistic\r\nadvance, harmony of color and domestic comfort and luxury being sought\r\nafter rather than monumental effects. A number of large city and country\r\nhouses designed on a palatial scale have, however, given opportunity for\r\na more elaborate architecture; notably the Vanderbilt, Villard, and\r\nHuntington residences at New York, the great country-seat of +Biltmore+,\r\nnear Asheville (N.C.), in the Francis I. style (by R. M. Hunt), and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n+OTHER BUILDINGS.+ American architects have generally been less\r\nsuccessful in public, administrative, and ecclesiastical architecture\r\nthan in commercial and domestic work. The preference for small parish\r\nchurches, treated as audience-rooms rather than as places of worship,\r\nhas interfered with the development of noble types of church-buildings.\r\nYet there are signs of improvement; and the new +Cathedral+ of +St. John\r\nthe Divine+ at New York, in a modified Romanesque style, promises to be\r\na worthy and monumental building. In semi-public architecture, such as\r\nhotels, theatres, clubs, and libraries, there are many notable examples\r\nof successful design. The +Ponce de Leon Hotel+ at St. Augustine,\r\na sumptuous and imposing pile in a free version of the Spanish\r\nPlateresco; the Auditorium Theatre at Chicago, the Madison Square Garden\r\nand the Casino at New York, may be cited as excellent in general\r\nconception and well carried out in detail, externally and internally.\r\nThe Century and Metropolitan Clubs at New York, the +Boston Public\r\nLibrary+, the Carnegie Library at Pittsburgh, the +Congressional\r\nLibrary+ at Washington, and the recently completed Minnesota +State\r\nCapitol+ at St. Paul, exemplify in varying degrees of excellence the\r\nincreasing capacity of American architects for monumental design. This\r\nwas further shown in the buildings of the +Columbian Exposition+ at\r\nChicago in 1893. These, in spite of many faults of detail, constituted\r\nan aggregate of architectural splendor such as had never before been\r\nseen or been possible on this side the Atlantic. They further brought\r\narchitecture into closer union with the allied arts and formed an object\r\nlesson in the value of appropriate landscape gardening as a setting to\r\nmonumental structures.\r\n\r\nIt should be said, in conclusion, that with the advances of recent years\r\nin artistic design in the United States there has been at least as great\r\nimprovement in scientific construction. The sham and flimsiness of the\r\nCivil War period are passing away, and solid and durable building is\r\nbecoming more general throughout the country, but especially in the\r\nNortheast and in some of the great Western cities, notably in Chicago.\r\nIn this onward movement the Federal buildings--post-offices,\r\ncustom-houses, and other governmental edifices--have not, till lately,\r\ntaken high rank. Although solidly and carefully constructed, those built\r\nduring the period 1875-1895 were generally inferior to the best work\r\nproduced by private enterprise, or by State and municipal governments.\r\nThis was in large part due to enactments devolving upon the supervising\r\narchitect at Washington the planning of all Federal buildings, as well\r\nas a burden of supervisory and clerical duties incompatible with the\r\nhighest artistic results. Since 1898, however, a more enlightened policy\r\nhas prevailed, and a number of notable designs for Federal buildings\r\nhave been secured by carefully-conducted competitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nORIENTAL ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\nINDIA, CHINA, AND JAPAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOKS RECOMMENDED: Cole, _Monographs of Ancient Monuments of\r\n  India_.

Among\r\nthem all, India alone has produced monuments of great architectural\r\nimportance. The buildings of China and Japan, although interesting for\r\ntheir style, methods, and detail, and so deserving at least of brief\r\nmention, are for the most part of moderate size and of perishable\r\nmaterials. Outside of these three countries there is little to interest\r\nthe general student of architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n+INDIA: PERIODS.+ It is difficult to classify the non-Mohammedan styles\r\nof India, owing to their frequently overlapping, both geographically and\r\nartistically; while the lack of precise dates in Indian literature makes\r\nthe chronology of many of the monuments more or less doubtful. The\r\ndivisions given below are a modification of those first established by\r\nFergusson, and are primarily based on the three great religions, with\r\ngeographical subdivisions, as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE BUDDHIST STYLE, from the reign of Asoka, _cir._ 250 B.C., to the 7th\r\ncentury A.D. Its monuments occupy mainly a broad band running northeast\r\nand southwest, between the Indian Desert and the Dekkan. Offshoots of\r\nthe style are found as far north as Gandhara, and as far south as\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\nTHE JAINA STYLE, akin to the preceding if not derived from it, covering\r\nthe same territory as well as southern India; from 1000 A.D. to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nTHE BRAHMAN or HINDU STYLES, extending over the whole peninsula. They\r\nare sub-divided geographically into the NORTHERN BRAHMAN, the CHALUKYAN\r\nin the Dekkan, and the DRAVIDIAN in the south; this last style being\r\ncoterminous with the populations speaking the Tamil and cognate\r\nlanguages. The monuments of these styles are mainly subsequent to the\r\n10th century, though a few date as far back as the 7th.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of Indian monuments are religious--temples, shrines,\r\nand monasteries. Secular buildings do not appear until after the Moslem\r\nconquests, and most of them are quite modern.\r\n\r\n\r\n+GENERAL CHARACTER.+ All these styles possess certain traits in common.\r\nWhile stone and brick are both used, sandstone predominating, the\r\ndetails are in large measure derived from wooden prototypes. Structural\r\nlines are not followed in the exterior treatment, purely decorative\r\nconsiderations prevailing. Ornament is equally lavished on all parts of\r\nthe building, and is bewildering in its amount and complexity. Realistic\r\nand grotesque sculpture is freely used, forming multiplied horizontal\r\nbands of extraordinary richness and minuteness of execution. Spacious\r\nand lofty interiors are rarely attempted, but wonderful effects are\r\nproduced by seemingly endless repetition of columns in halls, and\r\ncorridors, and by external emphasis of important parts of the plan by\r\nlofty tower-like piles of masonry.\r\n\r\nThe source of the various Indian styles, the origin of the forms used,\r\nthe history of their development, are all wrapped in obscurity. All the\r\nmonuments show a fully developed style and great command of technical\r\nresources from the outset. When, where, and how these were attained is\r\nas yet an unsolved mystery. In all its phases previous to the Moslem\r\nconquest Indian architecture appears like an indigenous art, borrowing\r\nlittle from foreign styles, and having no affinities with the arts of\r\nOccidental nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n+BUDDHIST STYLE.+ Although Buddhism originated in the sixth century\r\nB.C., the earliest architectural remains of the style date from its wide\r\npromulgation in India under Asoka (272-236 B.C.). Buddhist monuments\r\ncomprise three chief classes of structures: the _stupas_ or _topes_,\r\nwhich are mounds more or less domical in shape, enclosing relic-shrines\r\nof Buddha, or built to mark some sacred spot; _chaityas_, or temple\r\nhalls, cut in the rock; and _viharas_, or monasteries. The style of the\r\ndetail varies considerably in these three classes, but is in general\r\nsimpler and more massive than in the other styles of India.\r\n\r\n\r\n+TOPES.+ These are found in groups, of which the most important are at\r\nor near Bhilsa in central India, at Manikyala in the northwest, at\r\nAmravati in the south, and in Ceylon at Ruanwalli and Tuparamaya. The\r\nbest known among them is the +Sanchi Tope+, near Bhilsa, 120 feet in\r\ndiameter and 56 feet high. It is surrounded by a richly carved stone\r\nrail or fence, with gateways of elaborate workmanship, having three\r\nsculptured lintels crossing the carved uprights. The tope at Manikyala\r\nis larger, and dates from the 7th century. It is exceeded in size by\r\nmany in Ceylon, that at Abayagiri measuring 360 feet in diameter. Few of\r\nthe topes retain the _tee_, or model of a shrine, which, like a lantern,\r\nonce crowned each of them.\r\n\r\nBesides the topes there are a few stupas of tower-like form, square in\r\nplan, of which the most famous is that at +Buddh Gaya+, near the sacred\r\nBodhi tree, where Buddha attained divine light in 588 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHAITYA HALLS.+ The Buddhist speos-temples--so far as known the only\r\nextant halls of worship of that religion, except one at Sanchi--are\r\nmostly in the Bombay Presidency, at Ellora, Karli, Ajunta, Nassick, and\r\nBhaja. The earliest, that at Karli, dates from 78 B.C., the latest (at\r\nEllora), _cir._ 600 A.D. They consist uniformly of a broad nave ending\r\nin an apse, and covered by a roof like a barrel vault, and two narrow\r\nside aisles. In the apse is the _dagoba_ or relic-shrine, shaped like a\r\nminiature tope. The front of the cave was originally adorned with an\r\nopen-work screen or frame of wood, while the face of the rock about the\r\nopening was carved into the semblance of a sumptuous structural façade.\r\nAmong the finest of these caverns is that at +Karli+, whose massive\r\ncolumns and impressive scale recall Egyptian models, though the\r\nresemblance is superficial and has no historic significance. More\r\nsuggestive is the affinity of many of the columns which stand before\r\nthese caves to Persian prototypes (see Fig. 21). It is not improbable\r\nthat both Persian and classic forms were introduced into India through\r\nthe Bactrian kingdom 250 years B.C. Otherwise we must seek for the\r\norigin of nearly all Buddhist forms in a pre-existing wooden\r\narchitecture, now wholly perished, though its traditions may survive in\r\nthe wooden screens in the fronts of the caves. While some of these\r\ncaverns are extremely simple, as at Bhaja, others, especially at\r\n+Nassick+ and +Ajunta+, are of great splendor and complexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n+VIHARAS.+ Except at Gandhara in the Punjab, the structural monasteries\r\nof the Buddhists were probably all of wood and have long ago perished.\r\nThe Gandhara monasteries of Jamalgiri and Takht-i-Bahi present in plan\r\nthree or four courts surrounded by cells. The centre of one court is in\r\nboth cases occupied by a platform for an altar or shrine. Among the\r\nruins there have been found a number of capitals whose strong\r\nresemblance to the Corinthian type is now generally attributed to\r\nByzantine rather than Bactrian influences. These viharas may therefore\r\nbe assigned to the 6th or 7th century A.D.\r\n\r\nThe rock-cut viharas are found in the neighborhood of the chaityas\r\nalready described. Architecturally, they are far more elaborate than the\r\nchaityas. Those at Salsette, Ajunta, and Bagh are particularly\r\ninteresting, with pillared halls or courts, cells, corridors, and\r\nshrines. The hall of the +Great Vihara+ at +Bagh+ is 96 feet square,\r\nwith 36 columns. Adjoining it is the school-room, and the whole is\r\nfronted by a sumptuous rock-cut colonnade 200 feet long. These caves\r\nwere mostly hewn between the 5th and 7th centuries, at which time\r\nsculpture was more prevalent in Buddhist works than previously, and some\r\nof them are richly adorned with figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n+JAINA STYLE.+ The religion and the architecture of the Jainas so\r\nclosely resemble those of the Buddhists, that recent authorities are\r\ndisposed to treat the Jaina style as a mere variation or continuation of\r\nthe Buddhist. Chronologically they are separated by an interval of some\r\nthree centuries, _cir._ 650-950 A.D., which have left us almost no\r\nmonuments of either style. The Jaina is moreover easily distinguished\r\nfrom the Buddhist architecture by the great number and elaborateness of\r\nits structural monuments. The multiplication of statues of Tirthankhar\r\nin the cells about the temple courts, the exuberance of sculpture, the\r\nuse of domes built in horizontal courses, and the imitation in stone of\r\nwooden braces or struts are among its distinguishing features.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 226.--PORCH OF TEMPLE ON MOUNT ABU.]\r\n\r\n+JAINA TEMPLES.+ The earliest examples are on +Mount Abu+ in the Indian\r\nDesert. Built by Vimalah Sah in 1032, the chief of these consists of a\r\ncourt measuring 140 × 90 feet, surrounded by cells and a double\r\ncolonnade. In the centre rises the shrine of the god, containing his\r\nstatue, and terminating in a lofty tower or _sikhra_. An imposing\r\ncolumnar porch, cruciform in plan, precedes this cell (Fig. 226). The\r\nintersection of the arms is covered by a dome supported on eight columns\r\nwith stone brackets or struts. The dome and columns are covered with\r\nprofuse carving and sculptured figures, and the total effect is one of\r\nremarkable dignity and splendor. The temple of +Sadri+ is much more\r\nextensive, twenty minor domes and one of larger size forming cruciform\r\nporches on all four sides of the central _sikhra_. The cells about the\r\ncourt are each covered by a small _sikhra_, and these, with the\r\ntwenty-one domes (four of which are built in three stories), all grouped\r\nabout the central tower and adorned with an astonishing variety of\r\ndetail, constitute a monument of the first importance. It was built by\r\nKhumbo Rana, about 1450. At +Girnar+ are several 12th-century temples\r\nwith enclosed instead of open vestibules. One of these, that of\r\n+Neminatha+, retains intact its court enclosure and cells, which in most\r\nother cases have perished. The temple at +Somnath+ resembles it, but is\r\nlarger; the dome of its porch, 33 feet in diameter, is the largest Jaina\r\ndome in India. Other notable temples are at Gwalior, Khajuraho, and\r\nParasnatha.\r\n\r\nIn all the Jaina temples the salient feature is the sikhra or _vimana_.\r\nThis is a tower of approximately square plan, tapering by a graceful\r\ncurve toward a peculiar terminal ornament shaped like a flattened melon.\r\nIts whole surface is variegated by horizontal bands and vertical breaks,\r\ncovered with sculpture and carving. Next in importance are the domes,\r\nbuilt wholly in horizontal courses and resting on stone lintels carried\r\nby bracketed columns. These same traits appear in relatively modern\r\nexamples, as at Delhi.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 227.--TOWER OF VICTORY, CHITTORE.]\r\n\r\n+TOWERS.+ A similar predilection for minutely broken surfaces marks the\r\ntowers which sometimes adjoin the temples, as at Chittore (tower of +Sri\r\nAllat+, 13th century), or were erected as trophies of victory, like that\r\nof +Khumbo Rana+ in the same town (Fig. 227). The combination of\r\nhorizontal and vertical lines, the distribution of the openings, and the\r\nrich ornamentation of these towers are very interesting, though lacking\r\nsomewhat in structural propriety of design.\r\n\r\n\r\n+HINDU STYLES: NORTHERN BRAHMAN.+ The origin of this style is as yet an\r\nunsolved problem. Its monuments were mainly built between 600 and 1200\r\nA.D., the oldest being in Orissa, at Bhuwanesevar, Kanaruk, and Puri. In\r\nnorthern India the temples are about equally divided between the two\r\nforms of Brahmanism--the worship of Vishnu or _Vaishnavism_, and that of\r\nSiva or _Shaivism_--and do not differ materially in style. As in the\r\nJaina style, the _vimana_ is their most striking feature, and this is in\r\nmost cases adorned with numerous reduced copies of its own form grouped\r\nin successive stages against its sides and angles. This curious system\r\nof design appears in nearly all the great temples, both of Vishnu and\r\nSiva. The Jaina melon ornament is universal, surmounted generally by an\r\nurn-shaped finial.\r\n\r\nIn plan the vimana shrine is preceded by two or three chambers, square\r\nor polygonal, some with and some without columns. The foremost of these\r\nis covered by a roof formed like a stepped pyramid set cornerwise. The\r\nfine porch of the ruined temple at +Bindrabun+ is cruciform in plan and\r\nforms the chief part of the building, the shrine at the further end\r\nbeing relatively small and its tower unfinished or ruined. In some\r\nmodern examples the antechamber is replaced by an open porch with a\r\nSaracenic dome, as at Benares; in others the old type is completely\r\nabandoned, as in the temple at +Kantonnuggur+ (1704-22). This is a\r\nsquare hall built of terra-cotta, with four three-arched porches and\r\nnine towers, more Saracenic than Brahman in general aspect.\r\n\r\nThe +Kandarya Mahadeo+, at Khajuraho, is the most noted example of the\r\nnorthern Brahman style, and one of the most splendid structures extant.\r\nA strong and lofty basement supports an extraordinary mass of roofs,\r\ncovering the six open porches and the antechamber and hypostyle hall,\r\nwhich precede the shrine, and rising in successive pyramidal masses\r\nuntil the vimana is reached which covers the shrine. This is 116 feet\r\nhigh, but seems much loftier, by reason of the small scale of its\r\nconstituent parts and the marvellously minute decoration which covers\r\nthe whole structure. The vigor of its masses and the grand stairways\r\nwhich lead up to it give it a dignity unusual for its size, 60 × 109\r\nfeet in plan (_cir._ 1000 A.D.).\r\n\r\nAt Puri, in Orissa, the +Temple+ of +Jugganat+, with its double\r\nenclosure and numerous subordinate shrines, the Teli-ka-Mandir at\r\nGwalior, and temples at +Udaipur+ near Bhilsa, at +Mukteswara+ in\r\nOrissa, at Chittore, Benares, and Barolli, are important examples. The\r\nfew tombs erected subsequent to the Moslem conquest, combining Jaina\r\nbracket columns with Saracenic domes, and picturesquely situated palaces\r\nat Chittore (1450), Oudeypore (1580), and Gwalior, should also be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHALUKYAN STYLE.+ Throughout a central zone crossing the peninsula from\r\nsea to sea about the Dekkan, and extending south to Mysore on the west,\r\nthe Brahmans developed a distinct style during the later centuries of\r\nthe Chalukyan dynasty. Its monuments are mainly comprised between 1050\r\nand the Mohammedan conquest in 1310. The most notable examples of the\r\nstyle are found along the southwest coast, at Hullabid, Baillur, and\r\nSomnathpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n+TEMPLES.+ Chalukyan architecture is exclusively religious and its\r\ntemples are easily recognized. The plans comprise the same elements as\r\nthose of the Jainas, but the Chalukyan shrine is always star-shaped\r\nexternally in plan, and the vimana takes the form of a stepped pyramid\r\ninstead of a curved outline. The Jaina dome is, moreover, wholly\r\nwanting. All the details are of extraordinary richness and beauty, and\r\nthe breaking up of the surfaces by rectangular projections is skilfully\r\nmanaged so as to produce an effect of great apparent size with very\r\nmoderate dimensions. All the known examples stand on raised platforms,\r\nadding materially to their dignity. Some are double temples, as at\r\nHullabid (Fig. 228); others are triple in plan. A noticeable feature of\r\nthe style is the deeply cut stratification of the lower part of the\r\ntemples, each band or stratum bearing a distinct frieze of animals,\r\nfigures or ornament, carved with masterly skill. Pierced stone slabs\r\nfilling the window openings are also not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe richest exemplars of the style are the temples at +Baillur+ and\r\nSomnathpur, and at Hullabîd the +Kait Iswara+ and the incomplete +Double\r\nTemple+. The Kurti Stambha, or gate at Worangul, and the Great Temple at\r\n+Hamoncondah+ should also be mentioned.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 228.--TEMPLE AT HULLABÎD. DETAIL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+DRAVIDIAN STYLE.+ The Brahman monuments of southern India exhibit a\r\nstyle almost as strongly marked as the Chalukyan. This appears less in\r\ntheir details than in their general plan and conception. The Dravidian\r\ntemples are not single structures, but aggregations of buildings of\r\nvaried size and form, covering extensive areas enclosed by walls and\r\nentered through gates made imposing by lofty pylons called _gopuras_. As\r\nif to emphasize these superficial resemblances to Egyptian models, the\r\nsanctuary is often low and insignificant. It is preceded by much more\r\nimposing porches (_mantapas_) and hypostyle halls or _choultries_, the\r\nlatter being sometimes of extraordinary extent, though seldom lofty. The\r\nchoultrie, sometimes called the Hall of 1,000 Columns, is in some cases\r\nreplaced by pillared corridors of great length and splendor, as at\r\n+Ramisseram+ and +Madura.+ The plans are in most cases wholly irregular,\r\nand the architecture, so far from resembling the Egyptian in its scale\r\nand massiveness, is marked by the utmost minuteness of ornament and\r\ntenuity of detail, suggesting wood and stucco rather than stone. The\r\n+Great Hall+ at Chillambaram is but 10 to 12 feet high, and the\r\ncorridors at Ramisseram, 700 feet long, are but 30 feet high. The effect\r\nof _ensemble_ of the Dravidian temples is disappointing. They lack the\r\nemphasis of dominant masses and the dignity of symmetrical and logical\r\narrangement. The very loftiness of the gopuras makes the buildings of\r\nthe group within seem low by contrast. In nearly every temple, however,\r\nsome one feature attracts merited admiration by its splendor, extent, or\r\nbeauty. Such are the +Choultrie+, built by Tirumalla Nayak at Madura\r\n(1623-45), measuring 333 × 105 feet; the corridors already mentioned at\r\nRamisseram and in the +Great Temple+ at Madura; the gopuras at\r\n+Tarputry+ and Vellore, and the +Mantapa+ of +Parvati+ at Chillambaram\r\n(1595-1685). Very noticeable are the compound columns of this style,\r\nconsisting of square piers with slender shafts coupled to them and\r\nsupporting brackets, as at Chillambaram, Peroor, and Vellore; the richly\r\nbanded square piers, the grotesques of rampant horses and monsters, and\r\nthe endless labor bestowed upon minute carving and ornament in\r\nsuperposed bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n+OTHER MONUMENTS.+ Other important temples are at Tiruvalur, Seringham,\r\nTinevelly, and Conjeveram, all alike in general scheme of design, with\r\nenclosures varying from 300 to 1,000 feet in length and width. At\r\n+Tanjore+ is a magnificent temple with two courts, in the larger of\r\nwhich stands a _pagoda_ or shrine with a pyramidal vimana, unusual in\r\nDravidian temples, and beside it the smaller +Shrine+ of +Soubramanya+\r\n(Fig. 229), a structure of unusual beauty of detail. In both, the\r\nvertical lower story with its pilasters and windows is curiously\r\nsuggestive of Renaissance design. The pagoda dates from the 14th, the\r\nsmaller temple from the 15th century.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 229.--SHRINE OF SOUBRAMANYA, TANJORE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+ROCK-CUT RATHS.+ All the above temples were built subsequently to the\r\n12th century. The rock-cut shrines date in some cases as far back as the\r\n7th century; they are called _kylas_ and _raths_, and are not caves, but\r\nisolated edifices, imitating structural designs, but hewn bodily from\r\nthe rock. Those at Mahavellipore are of diminutive size; but at\r\n+Purudkul+ there is an extensive temple with shrine, choultrie, and\r\ngopura surrounded by a court enclosure measuring 250 × 150 feet (9th\r\ncentury). More famous still is the elaborate +Kylas+ at +Ellora+, of\r\nabout the same size as the above, but more complex and complete in its\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\n+PALACES.+ At Madura, Tanjore, and Vijayanagar are Dravidian palaces,\r\nbuilt after the Mohammedan conquest and in a mixed style. The domical\r\noctagonal throne-room and the +Great Hall+ at Madura (17th century), the\r\nmost famous edifices of the kind, were evidently inspired from Gothic\r\nmodels, but how this came about is not known. The Great Hall with its\r\npointed arched barrel vault of 67 feet span, its cusped arches, round\r\npiers, vaulting shafts, and triforium, appears strangely foreign to its\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CAMBODIA.+ The subject of Indian architecture cannot be dismissed\r\nwithout at least brief mention of the immense temple of +Nakhon Wat+ in\r\nCambodia. This stupendous creation covers an area of a full square mile,\r\nwith its concentric courts, its encircling moat or lake, its causeways,\r\nporches, and shrines, dominated by a central structure 200 feet square\r\nwith nine pagoda-like towers. The corridors around the inner court have\r\nsquare piers of almost classic Roman type. The rich carving, the perfect\r\nmasonry, and the admirable composition of the whole leading up to the\r\ncentral mass, indicate architectural ability of a high order.\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHINESE ARCHITECTURE.+ No purely Mongolian nation appears ever to have\r\nerected buildings of first-rate importance. It cannot be denied,\r\nhowever, that the Chinese are possessed of considerable decorative skill\r\nand mechanical ingenuity; and these qualities are the most prominent\r\nelements in their buildings. Great size and splendor, massiveness and\r\noriginality of construction, they do not possess. Built in large measure\r\nof wood, cleverly framed and decorated with a certain richness of color\r\nand ornament, with a large element of the grotesque in the decoration,\r\nthe Chinese temples, pagodas, and palaces are interesting rather than\r\nimpressive. There is not a single architectural monument of imposing\r\nsize or of great antiquity, so far as we know. The celebrated +Porcelain\r\nTower+ of Nankin is no longer extant, having been destroyed in the\r\nTæping rebellion in 1850. It was a nine-storied polygonal pagoda 236\r\nfeet high, revetted with porcelain tiles, and was built in 1412. The\r\nlargest of Chinese temples, that of the +Great Dragon+ at Pekin, is a\r\ncircular structure of moderate size, though its enclosure is nearly a\r\nmile square. Pagodas with diminishing stories, elaborately carved\r\nentrance gates and successive terraces are mainly relied upon for\r\neffect. They show little structural art, but much clever ornament. Like\r\nthe monasteries and the vast _lamaseries_ of Thibet, they belong to the\r\nBuddhist religion.\r\n\r\nAside from the ingenious framing and bracketing of the carpentry, the\r\nmost striking peculiarity of Chinese buildings is their broad-spreading\r\ntiled roofs. These invariably slope downward in a curve, and the tiling,\r\nwith its hip-ridges, crestings, and finials in terra-cotta or metal,\r\nadds materially to the picturesqueness of the general effect. Color and\r\ngilding are freely used, and in some cases--as in a summer pavilion at\r\nPekin--porcelain tiling covers the walls, with brilliant effect. The\r\nchief wonder is that this resource of the architectural decorator has\r\nnot been further developed in China, where porcelain and earthenware are\r\notherwise treated with such remarkable skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n+JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE.+ Apparently associated in race with the Chinese\r\nand Koreans, the Japanese are far more artistic in temperament than\r\neither of their neighbors. The refinement and originality of their\r\ndecorative art have given it a wide reputation. Unfortunately the\r\nprevalence of earthquakes has combined with the influence of the\r\ntraditional habits of the people to prevent the maturing of a truly\r\nmonumental architecture. Except for the terraces, gates, and enclosures\r\nof their palaces and temples, wood is the predominant building material.\r\nIt is used substantially as in China, the framing, dovetailing,\r\nbracketing, broad eaves and tiled roofs of Japan closely resembling\r\nthose of China. The chief difference is in the greater refinement and\r\ndelicacy of the Japanese details and the more monumental disposition of\r\nthe temple terraces, the beauty of which is greatly enhanced by skillful\r\nlandscape gardening. The gateways recall somewhat those of the Sanchi\r\nTope in India (p. 403), but are commonly of wood. Owing to the danger\r\nfrom earthquakes, lofty towers and pagodas are rarely seen.\r\n\r\nThe domestic architecture of Japan, though interesting for its\r\narrangements, and for its sensible and artistic use of the most flimsy\r\nmaterials, is too trivial in scale, detail, and construction to receive\r\nmore than passing reference. Even the great palace at Tokio,[28]\r\ncovering an immense area, is almost entirely composed of one-storied\r\nbuildings of wood, with little of splendor or architectural dignity.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: See Transactions R.I.B.A., 52d year, 1886, article\r\n    by R.

They\r\nhave proved the existence of an active and flourishing commerce between\r\nEgypt and the Mediterranean shores and Aegean islands more than 2000\r\nB.C., and of a flourishing material civilization in those islands and on\r\nthe mainland of Greece, borrowing much, but not everything, from Egypt.\r\nWhile the origin of the Doric order in the structural methods of the\r\npre-Homeric architecture of Tiryns and Mycenæ, as set forth by Dörpfeld\r\nand by Perrot and Chipiez, can hardly be regarded as proved in all\r\ndetails, since much of the argument advanced for this derivation rests\r\non more or less conjectural restorations of the existing remains, it\r\nseems to be fairly well established that the Doric order, and historic\r\nGreek architecture in general, trace their genesis in large measure back\r\nin direct line to this prehistoric art. The remarkable feature of this\r\nearly architecture is the apparently complete absence of temples.\r\nFortifications, houses, palaces, and tombs make up the ruins thus far\r\ndiscovered, and seem to indicate clearly the derivation of the\r\ntemple-type of later Greek art from the primitive house, consisting of a\r\nhall or _megaron_ with four columns about the central hearth (whence no\r\ndoubt, the atrium and peristyle of Roman houses, through their Greek\r\nintermediary prototypes) and a porch or _aithousa_, with or without\r\ncolumns _in antis_, opening directly into the _megaron_, or indirectly\r\nthrough an ante-room called the _prodomos_. Here we have the prototypes\r\nof the Greek temple _in antis_, with its _naos_ having interior columns,\r\nwhether roofed over or hypæthral (see pp. 54, 55). It is probable also\r\nthat the evidently liberal use of timber for many of the structural\r\ndetails led in time to many of the forms later developed in stone in the\r\nentablature of the Doric order. But it is hard to discover, as Dörpfeld\r\nwould have it, in the slender Mycenæan columns with their inverted\r\ntaper, the prototype of the massive Doric column with its upward taper.\r\nThe Mycenæan column was evidently derived from wooden models; the sturdy\r\nDoric column--the earliest being the most massive--seems plainly derived\r\nfrom stone or rubble piers (see p. 50), and thus to have come from a\r\ndifferent source from the Mycenæan forms.\r\n\r\nThe _gynecæum_, or women’s apartments, the men’s apartments, and the\r\nbath were in these ancient palaces grouped in varying relations about\r\nthe _megaron_: their plan, purpose, and arrangement are clearly revealed\r\nin the ruins of Tiryns, where they are more complete and perfect than\r\neither at Troy or Mycenæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. +CAMPANILES IN ITALY.+--Reference is made on page 264 to the towers\r\nor campaniles of the Italian Gothic style and period, and six of these\r\nare specifically mentioned; and on page 305 mention is also made of\r\nthose of the Renaissance in Italy. The number and importance of the\r\nItalian campaniles and the interest attaching to their origin and\r\ndesign, warrant a more extended notice than has been assigned them in\r\nthe pages cited.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of these bell-towers appear to be those adjoining the two\r\nchurches of San Apollinare in and near Ravenna (see p. 114), and date\r\npresumably from the sixth century. They are plain circular towers with\r\nfew and small openings, except in the uppermost story, where larger\r\narched openings permit the issue of the sound of the bells. This type,\r\nwhich might have been developed into a very interesting form of tower,\r\ndoes not seem to have been imitated. It was at Rome, and not till the\r\nninth or tenth century, that the campanile became a recognized feature\r\nof church architecture. It was invariably treated as a structure\r\ndistinct from the church, and was built of brick upon a square plan,\r\nrising with little or no architectural adornment to a height usually of\r\na hundred feet or more, and furnished with but a few small openings\r\nbelow the belfry stage, where a pair of coupled arched windows separated\r\nby a simple column opened from each face of the tower. Above these\r\nwindows a pyramidal roof of low pitch terminated the tower. In spite of\r\ntheir simplicity of design these Roman bell-towers often possess a\r\nnoticeable grace of proportions, and furnish the prototype of many of\r\nthe more elaborate campaniles erected during the Middle Ages in other\r\ncentral and north Italian cities. The towers of Sta. Maria in Cosmedin,\r\nSta. Maria in Trastevere, and S. Giorgio in Velabro are examples of this\r\ntype. Most of the Roman examples date from the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIn other cities, the campanile was treated with some variety of form and\r\ndecoration, as well as of material. In Lombardy and Venetia the square\r\nred-brick shaft of the tower is often adorned with long, narrow pilaster\r\nstrips, as at Piacenza (p. 158, Fig. 91) and Venice, and an arcaded\r\ncornice not infrequently crowns the structure. The openings at the top\r\nmay be three or four in number on each face, and even the plan is\r\nsometimes octagonal or circular. The brick octagonal campanile of\r\n+S. Gottardo+ at Milan is one of the finest Lombard church towers. At\r\nVerona the brick tower on the Piazza dell’ Erbe and that of S. Zeno are\r\nconspicuous; but every important town of northern Italy possesses one or\r\nmore examples of these structures dating from the eleventh, twelfth, or\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the three most noted bell-towers in Italy are those of\r\nVenice, Pisa, and Florence. The great +Campanile+ of +St. Mark+ at\r\nVenice, first begun in 874, carried higher in the twelfth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, and finally completed in the sixteenth century with the\r\nmarble belvedere and wooden spire so familiar in pictures of Venice, was\r\nformerly the highest of all church campaniles in Italy, measuring\r\napproximately 325 feet to the summit. But this superb historic monument,\r\nweakened by causes not yet at this writing fully understood, fell in\r\nsudden ruin on the 14th of July, 1902, to the great loss not only of\r\nVenice, but of the world of art, though fortunately without injuring the\r\nneighboring buildings on the Piazza and Piazzetta of St. Mark. Since\r\nthen the campanile of S. Stefano, in the same city, has been demolished\r\nto forestall another like disaster. The +Leaning Tower+ of Pisa (see\r\np. 160, Fig. 92) dates from 1174, and is unique in its plan and its\r\nexterior treatment with superposed arcades. Begun apparently as a\r\nleaning tower, it seems to have increased this lean to a dangerous\r\npoint, by the settling of its foundations during construction, as its\r\nupper stages were made to deviate slightly towards the vertical from the\r\ninclination of the lower portion. It has always served rather as a\r\nwatch-tower and belvedere than as a bell-tower. The +Campanile+\r\nadjoining the Duomo at +Florence+ is described on p. 263 and illustrated\r\nin Fig. 154, and does not require further notice here. The\r\nblack-and-white banded towers of Sienna, Lucca, and Pistoia, and the\r\noctagonal lanterns crowning those of Verona and Mantua, also referred to\r\nin the text on p. 264, need here only be mentioned again as illustrating\r\nthe variety of treatment of these Italian towers.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance architects developed new types of campanile, and in such\r\nvariety that they can only be briefly referred to. Some, like a brick\r\ntower at Perugia, are simple square towers with pilasters; more often\r\nengaged columns and entablatures mark the several stories, and the upper\r\nportion is treated either with an octagonal lantern or with diminishing\r\nstages, and sometimes with a spire. Of the latter class the best example\r\nis that of S. Biagio, at Montepulciano,--one of the two designed to\r\nflank the façade of Ant. da S. Gallo’s beautiful church of that name.\r\nOne or two good late examples are to be found at Naples. Of the more\r\nmassive square type there are examples in the towers of S. Michele,\r\nVenice; of the cathedral at Ferrara, Sta. Chiara at Naples, and Sta.\r\nMaria dell’ Anima--one of the earliest--at Rome. The most complete and\r\nperfect of these square belfries of the Renaissance is that of the\r\n+Campidoglio+ at Rome, by Martino Lunghi, dating from the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, which groups so admirably with the palaces of the\r\nCapitol.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. +BRAMANTE’S WORKS.+--A more or less animated controversy has arisen\r\nregarding the authenticity of many of the works attributed to Bramante,\r\nand the tendency has of late been to deny him any part whatever in\r\nseveral of the most important of these works. The first of these to be\r\ngiven a changed assignment was the church of the Consolazione at Todi\r\n(p. 293), now believed to be by Cola di Caprarola; and it is now denied\r\nby many investigators that either the Cancelleria or the Giraud palace\r\n(p. 290) is his work, or any one of two or three smaller houses in Rome\r\nshowing a somewhat similar architectural treatment. The evidence adduced\r\nin support of this denial is rather speculative and critical than\r\ndocumentary, but is not without weight. The date 1495 carved on a\r\ndoorway of the Cancelleria palace is thought to forbid its attribution\r\nto Bramante, who is not known to have come to Rome till 1503; and there\r\nis a lack of positive evidence of his authorship of the Giraud palace\r\nand the other houses which seem to be by the same hand as the\r\nCancelleria. To the advocates of this view there is not enough\r\nresemblance in style between this group of buildings and his\r\nacknowledged work either in Milan or in the Vatican to warrant their\r\nbeing attributed to him.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remarked, that this notable group of works, stamped\r\nwith the marks and even the mannerisms of a strong personality, reveal\r\nin their unknown author gifts amounting to genius, and heretofore deemed\r\nnot unworthy of Bramante. It is almost inconceivable that they should\r\nhave been designed by a mere beginner previously utterly unknown and\r\nforgotten soon after. It is incumbent upon those who deny the\r\nattribution to Bramante to find another name, if possible, on which to\r\nfasten the credit of these works. Accordingly, they have been variously\r\nattributed to Alberti (who died in 1472) or his followers; to Bernardo\r\ndi Lorenzo, and to other later fifteenth-century artists. The difficulty\r\nhere is to discover any name that fits the conditions even as well as\r\nBramante’s; for the supposed author must have been in Rome between 1495\r\nand 1505, and his other works must be at least as much like these as\r\nwere Bramante’s. No name has thus far been found satisfactory to careful\r\ncritics; and the alternative theory, that there existed in Rome, before\r\nBramante’s coming, a group of architects unknown to later fame, working\r\nin a common style and capable of such a masterpiece as the Cancelleria,\r\ndoes not harmonize with the generally accepted facts of Renaissance art\r\nhistory. Moreover, the comparison of these works with Bramante’s\r\nMilanese work on the one hand and his great Court of the Belvedere in\r\nthe Vatican on the other, yields, to some critics, conclusions quite\r\nopposed to those of the advocates of another authorship than Bramante’s.\r\n\r\nThe controversy must be considered for the present as still open. There\r\nare manifest difficulties with either of the two opposed views, and\r\nthese can hardly be eliminated, except by the discovery of documents not\r\nnow known to exist, whose testimony will be recognized as unimpeachable.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. +L’ART NOUVEAU.+--Since 1896, and particularly since the Paris\r\nExposition of 1900, a movement has manifested itself in France and\r\nBelgium, and spread to Germany and Austria and even measurably to\r\nEngland, looking towards a more personal and original style of\r\ndecorative and architectural design, in which the traditions and\r\nhistoric styles of the past shall be ignored. This movement has received\r\nfrom its adherents and the public the name of “L’Art Nouveau,” or,\r\naccording to some, “L’Art Moderne”; but this name must not be held to\r\nconnote either a really new style or a fundamentally new principle in\r\nart. Indeed, it may be questioned whether any clearly-defined body of\r\nprinciples whatever underlies the movement, or would be acknowledged\r\nequally by all its adherents. It appears to be a reaction against a too\r\nslavish adherence to traditional forms and methods of design (see pp.\r\n370, 375), a striving to ignore or forget the past rather than a\r\nreaching out after any well-understood, positive end; as such, it\r\npossesses the negative strength of protest rather than the affirmative\r\nstrength of a vital principle. Its lack of cohesion is seen in the\r\ndivision of its adherents into groups, some looking to nature for\r\ninspiration, while others decry this as a mistaken quest; some seeking\r\nto emphasize structural lines, and others to ignore them altogether.\r\nAll, however, are united in the avoidance of commonplace forms and\r\nhistoric styles, and this preoccupation has developed an amazing amount\r\nof originality and individualism of style, frequently reaching the\r\nextreme of eccentricity. The results have therefore been, as might be\r\nexpected, extremely varied in merit, ranging from the most refined and\r\nreserved in style to the most harshly bizarre and extravagant. As a\r\nrule, they have been most successful in small and semi-decorative\r\nobjects--jewelry, silverware, vases, and small furniture; and one most\r\ndesirable feature of the movement has been the stimulus it has given\r\n(especially in France and England), to the organization and activity of\r\n“arts-and-crafts” societies which occupy themselves with the\r\nencouragement of the decorative and industrial arts and the diffusion of\r\nan improved taste. In the field of the larger objects of design, in\r\nwhich the dominance of traditional form and of structural considerations\r\nis proportionally more imperious, the struggle to evade these\r\nrestrictions becomes more difficult, and results usually in more obvious\r\nand disagreeable eccentricities, which the greater size and permanence\r\nof the object tend further to exaggerate. The least successful\r\nachievements of the movement have accordingly been in architecture. The\r\nbuildings designed by its most fervent disciples (_e.g._ the Pavillon\r\nBleu at the Exposition of 1900, the Castel Béranger, Paris, by _H.\r\nGuimard_, the houses of the artist colony at Darmstadt, and others) are\r\nfor the most part characterized by extreme stiffness, eccentricity, or\r\nugliness. The requirements of construction and of human habitation\r\ncannot easily be met without sometimes using the forms which past\r\nexperience has developed for the same ends; and the negation of\r\nprecedent is not the surest path to beauty or even reasonableness of\r\ndesign. It is interesting to notice that in the intermediate field of\r\nfurniture-design some of the best French productions recall the style of\r\nLouis XV., modified by Japanese ideas and spirit. This singular but not\r\nunpleasing combination is less surprising when we reflect that the style\r\nof Louis XV. was itself a protest against the formalism of the heavy\r\nclassic architecture of preceding reigns, and achieved its highest\r\nsuccesses in the domain of furniture and interior decoration.\r\n\r\nIt may be fair to credit the new movement with one positive\r\ncharacteristic in its prevalent regard for line, especially for the\r\neffect of long and swaying lines, whether in the contours or\r\nornamentation of an object. This is especially noticeable in the Belgian\r\nwork, and in that of the Viennese “Secessionists,” who have, however,\r\ncarried eccentricity to a further point of extravagance than any others.\r\n\r\nWhether “L’Art Nouveau” will ever produce permanent results time alone\r\ncan show. Its present vogue is probably evanescent and it cannot claim\r\nto have produced a style; but it seems likely to exert on European\r\narchitecture an influence, direct and indirect, not unlike that of the\r\nNéo-Grec movement of 1830 in France (p. 364), but even more lasting and\r\nbeneficial. It has already begun to break the hold of rigid classical\r\ntradition in design; and recent buildings, especially in Germany and\r\nAustria, like the works of the brilliant _Otto Wagner_ in Vienna, show a\r\npleasing freedom of personal touch without undue striving after\r\neccentric novelty. Doubtless in French and other European architecture\r\nthe same result will in time manifest itself.\r\n\r\nThe search for novelty and the desire to dispense wholly with historic\r\nforms of design which are the chief marks of the Art Nouveau, were\r\nemphatically displayed in many of the remarkable buildings of the Paris\r\n+Exhibition of 1900+, in which a striking fertility and facility of\r\ndesign in the decorative details made more conspicuous the failure to\r\nimprove upon the established precedents of architectural style in the\r\nmatters of proportion, scale, general composition, and contour. As usual\r\nthe metallic construction of these buildings was almost without\r\nexception admirable, and the decorative details, taken by themselves,\r\nextremely clever and often beautiful, but the combined result was not\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the movement has not found a firm foothold because\r\nthere has been no dominant, enslaving tradition to protest against. Not\r\na few of the ideas, not a little of the spirit of the movement may be\r\nrecognized in the work of individual architects and decorative artists\r\nin the United States, executed years before the movement took\r\nrecognizable form in Europe: and American decorative design has\r\ngenerally been, at least since 1880 or 1885, sufficiently free,\r\nindividual and personal, to render unnecessary and impossible any\r\nconcerted movement of artistic revolt against slavery to precedent.\r\n\r\n\r\nE. +RECENT AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE.+--Architectural activity in the United\r\nStates continues to share in the general prosperity which has marked the\r\nyears since 1898, and this activity has by no means been confined to\r\nindustrial and commercial architecture. Indeed, while the erection of\r\n“sky scrapers” or excessively lofty office-buildings has continued to be\r\na feature of this activity in the great commercial centres, the most\r\nnotable architectural enterprises of recent years have been in the field\r\nof educational buildings, both in the East and West. In 1898 a great\r\ninternational competition resulted in the selection of the design of Mr.\r\n_E. Bénard_ of Paris for a magnificent group of buildings for the\r\n+University of California+ on a scale of unexampled grandeur, and the\r\nerection of this colossal project has been begun. An almost equally\r\nambitious project, by a firm of Philadelphia architects, has been\r\nadopted for the Washington University at St. Louis; and many other\r\nuniversities and colleges have either added extensively to their\r\nexisting buildings or planned an entire rebuilding on new designs. Among\r\nthese the national military and naval academies at +West Point+ and\r\n+Annapolis+ take the first rank in the extent and splendor of the\r\nprojected improvements. Museums and libraries have also been erected or\r\nbegun in various cities, and the +New York Public Library+, now\r\nbuilding, will rank in cost and beauty with those already erected in\r\nBoston and Washington.\r\n\r\nIn other departments mention should be made of recent Federal buildings\r\n(custom-houses, post-offices, and court-houses) erected under the\r\nprovisions of the Tarsney act from designs secured by competition among\r\nthe leading architects of the country; among those the +New York Custom\r\nHouse+ is the most important, but other buildings, at Washington,\r\nIndianapolis, and elsewhere, are also conspicuous, and many of them\r\nworthy of high praise. The tendency to award the designing of important\r\npublic buildings, such as State capitols, county court houses, city\r\nhalls, libraries, and hospitals, by competition instead of by personal\r\nand political favor, has resulted in a marked improvement in the quality\r\nof American public architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nF. +THE ERECHTHEUM: RECENT INVESTIGATIONS.+--During the past two years,\r\nextensive repairs and partial restorations of the Erechtheum at Athens,\r\nundertaken by the Greek Archæological Society, have afforded\r\nopportunities for a new and thoroughgoing study of the existing portions\r\nof the building and of the surrounding ruins. In these investigations a\r\nprominent part has been borne by Mr. Gorham P. Stevens, representing the\r\nArchæological Institute of America, to whom must be credited, among\r\nother things, the demonstration of the existence, in the east wall of\r\nthe original structure, of two windows previously unknown. Other\r\npeculiarities of design and construction were also discovered, which add\r\ngreatly to the interest of the building. These investigations are\r\nreported in the _American Journal of Archæology_, Second Series;\r\n_Journal of the Archæological Institute of America_, Vol. X., No. 1, _et\r\nseq._ The illustrations, Figures 35 and 36, are, by Mr. Stevens’\r\ncourtesy, based upon, though not reproductions of, his original\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\nOF TERMS NOT DEFINED IN THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n\r\nALCAZAR (Span., from Arabic _Al Kasr_), a palace or castle, especially\r\nof a governing official.\r\n\r\nARCHIVOLT, a band or group of mouldings decorating the wall-face of an\r\narch; or a transverse arch projecting slightly from the surface of a\r\nbarrel or groined vault.\r\n\r\nASTYLAR, without columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALNEA, a Roman bathing establishment, less extensive than the _thermæ_.\r\n\r\nBEL ETAGE, the principal story of a building, containing the reception\r\nrooms and saloons; usually the second story (first above the ground\r\nstory).\r\n\r\nBROKEN ENTABLATURE, an entablature which projects forward over each\r\ncolumn or pilaster, returning back to the wall and running along with\r\ndiminished projection between the columns, as in the Arch of Constantine\r\n(Fig. 63).\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTONED PIERS, piers adorned with columns or pilasters at the corners\r\nor on the outer faces.\r\n\r\nCARTOUCHE (Fr.), an ornament shaped like a shield or oval.

The initial volume of a promising series ... seems a model of pith,\r\nlucidity, and practical convenience; and that it is sound and accurate\r\nthe author’s name is a sufficient guarantee. Essential historical and\r\nbiographical facts, together with brief critical estimates and\r\ncharacterizations of leading schools and painters, are given in a few\r\nwell-chosen words; and for students who wish to pursue the subject in\r\ndetail, a list of selected authorities at the head of each chapter\r\npoints the way. Serviceable lists are also provided of principal extant\r\nworks, together with the places where they are to be found. The text is\r\nliberally sprinkled with illustrations in half-tone.”--DIAL, CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n“Prof. Van Dyke has performed his task with great thoroughness and good\r\nsuccess.... He seems to us singularly happy in his characterization of\r\nvarious artists, and amazingly just in proportion. We have hardly found\r\nan instance in which the relative importance accorded a given artist\r\nseemed to us manifestly wrong, and hardly one in which the special\r\ncharacteristics of a style were not adequately presented.”--NATION, N.Y.\r\n\r\n“... Gives a good general view of the subject, avoiding as a rule all\r\nelaborate theories and disputed points, and aiming to distinguish the\r\nvarious historical schools from one another by their differences of\r\nsubject and technique ... we do not know of anybody who has, on the\r\nwhole, accomplished the task with as much success as has Mr. Van Dyke.\r\nThe book is modern in spirit and thoroughly up-to-date in point of\r\ninformation.”--ART AMATEUR.\r\n\r\n“Professor Van Dyke has made a radical departure in one respect, in\r\npurposely omitting the biographical details with which text-books on art\r\nare usually encumbered, and substituting short critical estimates of\r\nartists and of their rank among the painters of their time. This feature\r\nof the work is highly to be commended, as it affords means for\r\ncomparative study that cannot fail to be beneficial.... Altogether\r\nProfessor Van Dyke’s text-book is worthy of general adoption, and as a\r\nvolume of ready reference for the family library it will have a distinct\r\nusefulness. It is compact, comprehensive, and admirably\r\narranged.”--BEACON, BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGMANS, GREEN, & CO.,\r\n\r\n91 & 93 Fifth Avenue, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA History of Sculpture.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nALLAN MARQUAND, Ph.D., L.H.D.\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nARTHUR L. FROTHINGHAM, Jr., Ph.D.\r\n\r\nProfessors of Archæology and the History of Art in Princeton University.\r\n\r\n+With Frontispiece and 113 Illustrations in half-tone in the text,\r\nBibliographies, Addresses for Photographs and Casts, etc. Crown 8vo, 313\r\npages, $1.50.+\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY W. KENT, _Curator of the Seater Museum, Watkins, N.Y._\r\n\r\n“Like the other works in this series of yours, it is simply invaluable,\r\nfilling a long-felt want. The bibliographies and lists will be keenly\r\nappreciated by all who work with a class of students.”\r\n\r\nCHARLES H. MOORE, _Harvard University_.\r\n\r\n“The illustrations are especially good, avoiding the excessively black\r\nbackground which produce harsh contrasts and injure the outlines of so\r\nmany half-tone prints.”\r\n\r\nJ. M. HOPPIN, _Yale University_.\r\n\r\n“These names are sufficient guarantee for the excellence of the book and\r\nits fitness for the object it was designed for. I was especially\r\ninterested in the chapter on _Renaissance Sculpture in Italy_.”\r\n\r\nCRITIC, _New York_.\r\n\r\n“This history is a model of condensation.... Each period is treated in\r\nfull, with descriptions of its general characteristics and its\r\nindividual developments under various conditions, physical, political,\r\nreligious and the like.... A general history of sculpture has never\r\nbefore been written in English--never in any language in convenient\r\ntextbook form. This publication, then, should meet with an enthusiastic\r\nreception among students and amateurs of art, not so much, however,\r\nbecause it is the only book of its kind, as for its intrinsic merit and\r\nattractive form.”\r\n\r\nOUTLOOK, _New York_.\r\n\r\n“A concise survey of the history of sculpture is something needed\r\neverywhere.... A good feature of this book--and one which should be\r\nimitated--is the list indicating where casts and photographs may best be\r\nobtained. Of course such a volume is amply indexed.”\r\n\r\nNOTRE DAME SCHOLASTIC, _Notre Dame, Ind._\r\n\r\n“The work is orderly, the style lucid and easy. The illustrations,\r\nnumbering over a hundred, are sharply cut and well selected. Besides a\r\ngeneral bibliography, there is placed at the end of each period of style\r\na special list to which the student may refer, should he wish to pursue\r\nmore fully any particular school.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGMANS, GREEN & CO., Publishers,\r\n\r\n91 & 93 Fifth Avenue, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nERRORS AND INCONSISTENCIES:\r\n\r\nMissing or invisible punctuation has been silently supplied, as have\r\nmissing umlauts and line-end hyphens; errors of this type were assumed\r\nto be mechanical, introduced either in printing or scanning. Conversely,\r\n“Bauschule” (Berlin) was consistently misprinted as “Bauschüle”.\r\n\r\nHyphenization of some words was inconsistent: zigzag and zig-zag,\r\nsemicircular and semi-circular, staircase and stair-case. The plural of\r\n“portico” is regularly “porticos”, rarely “porticoes”. Both occurrences\r\nof “mantelpiece” are at line-break; the hyphen was omitted based on\r\nusage in the 8th edition.\r\n\r\nAlphabetization in the Index is as printed.\r\n\r\nNames:\r\n\r\n  The architect Robert Adam is consistently called “Adams”; the error\r\n    was corrected in the 8th edition. The name form “Michael Angelo”\r\n    is standard for the time.\r\n  Columbia College changed its name to Columbia University in 1896,\r\n    presumably after the book’s original preface (dated January 20,\r\n    1896) was written.\r\n  The French palace is variously Luxembourg and Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nSpelling of place names was unchanged except when there was an\r\nunambiguous error.

The\r\nEnglish city is Peterboro’ (with apostrophe) in its first few\r\nappearances, and then changes to Peterborough for the remainder of\r\nthe book. The Italian city was conventionally spelled “Sienna” (with\r\ntwo n’s) in English.\r\n\r\nMany names, especially non-European ones, differ significantly from\r\ntheir modern form. Some of the following are conjectural.\r\n\r\nNear East:\r\n\r\n  Ipsamboul: Abu Simbel\r\n  Bozrah: probably modern Bouseira, Jordan (not “Bosrah”, modern Basra)\r\n\r\nGreater India (including modern Pakistan and Bangladesh)\r\n\r\n  Tope: the form “stupa” is more common\r\n  Indian desert: Thar desert\r\n\r\n  Baillur: Belur\r\n  Chillambaram: probably Chidambaram; the author’s sources seem to\r\n    have had trouble with “l” in South Indian names\r\n  Conjeveram: Kanchipuram\r\n  Futtehpore Sikhri: Fatehpur Sikri\r\n  Hullabid: Halebid\r\n  Jaunpore: Janpur\r\n  Jugganat: the name of the deity is Jagannath; the English name-form\r\n    led to the word “juggernaut”\r\n  Kantonnuggur: Kantanagar\r\n  Oudeypore: the author seems not to have realized that this is the same\r\n    place as Udaipur, cited with that spelling in the same paragraph\r\n  Scinde: Sind\r\n  Shepree: could not be identified.\r\n    The author’s source is probably James Ferguson, who describes it\r\n    as “near Gualior” (Gwalior)\r\n  Tanjore: Thanjavur\r\n  Worangul: Varangal\r\n\r\nCambodia:\r\n\r\n  Nakhon Wat: better known as Angkor Wat",
