WINSTON CO.\r\n\r\nCHICAGO PHILADELPHIA TORONTO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work is strictly what its title page imports, a COMPILATION. Fox's\r\n\"Book of Martyrs\" has been made the basis of this volume. Liberty,\r\nhowever, has been taken to abridge wherever it was thought\r\nnecessary;--to alter the antiquated form of the phraseology; to\r\nintroduce additional information; and to correct any inaccuracy\r\nrespecting matters of fact, which had escaped the author of the original\r\nwork, or which has been found erroneous by the investigation of modern\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nThe object of this work, is to give a brief history of persecution since\r\nthe first introduction of christianity, till the present time. In doing\r\nthis, we have commenced with the martyrdom of Stephen, and following the\r\ncourse of events, have brought the History of persecution down to the\r\nyear 1830. In all ages, we find that a disposition to persecute for\r\nopinion's sake, has been manifested by wicked men, whatever may have\r\nbeen their opinions or sentiments on religious subjects. The intolerant\r\njew, and the bigoted pagan, have exhibited no more of a persecuting\r\nspirit, than the nominal professor of christianity, and the _infidel_\r\nand the avowed _atheist_. Indeed, it seems to be an \"inherent vice,\" in\r\nunsanctified nature to endeavour by the pressure of physical force, to\r\nrestrain obnoxious sentiments, and to propagate favourite opinions. It\r\nis only when the heart has been renewed and sanctified by divine grace,\r\nthat men have rightly understood and practised the true principles of\r\ntoleration. We do not say that none but real christians have adopted\r\ncorrect views respecting civil and religious liberty;--but we affirm\r\nthat these views owe their origin entirely to christianity and its\r\ngenuine disciples.\r\n\r\nThough nearly all sects have persecuted their opponents, during a brief\r\nseason, when men's passions were highly excited, and true religion had\r\nmournfully declined, yet no denomination except the papal hierarchy, has\r\nadopted as an article of religious belief, and a principle of practical\r\nobservance, the right to destroy heretics for opinion's sake. The\r\ndecrees of councils, and the bulls of popes, issued in conformity with\r\nthose decrees, place this matter beyond a doubt. Persecution, therefore,\r\nand popery, are inseparably connected; because claiming infallibility,\r\nwhat she has once done is right for her to do again; yea, must be done\r\nunder similar circumstances, or the claims of infallibility given up.\r\nThere is no escaping this conclusion. It is right, therefore, to charge\r\nupon popery, all the persecutions and horrid cruelties which have\r\nstained the annals of the papal church during her long and bloody career\r\nof darkness and crime. Every sigh which has been heaved in the dungeons\r\nof the Inquisition--every groan which has been extorted by the racks and\r\ninstruments of torture, which the malice of her bigoted votaries,\r\nstimulated by infernal wisdom, ever invented, has witnessed in the ear\r\nof God, against the \"Mother of Harlots;\" and those kings of the earth,\r\nwho giving their power to the \"Beast\" have aided her in the cruel work\r\nof desolation and death. The valleys of Piedmont, the mountains of\r\nSwitzerland, the vine crowned hills of Italy and France--and all parts\r\nof Germany and the low countries, have by turns, been lighted by the\r\nfires of burning victims, or crimsoned with the blood of those who have\r\nsuffered death at the hands of the cruel emissaries of popery. England\r\ntoo, has drunken deep of the \"wine of the fierceness of her wrath,\" as\r\nthe blood of Cobham, and the ashes of the Smithfield martyrs can\r\ntestify. Ireland and Scotland, likewise, have each been made the theatre\r\nof her atrocities. But no where has the system been exhibited in its\r\nnative unalleviated deformity, as in Spain, Portugal and their South\r\nAmerican dependencies. For centuries, such a system of police was\r\nestablished by the _Holy Inquisitors_, that these countries resembled a\r\nvast whispering gallery, where the slightest murmur of discontent could\r\nbe heard and punished. Such has been the effect of superstition and the\r\nterror of the Holy Office, upon the mind, as completely to break the\r\npride of the Castillian noble, and make him the unresisting victim of\r\nevery mendicant friar and \"hemp-sandaled monk.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, the papal system has opposed the march of civilization and\r\nliberty throughout the world, by denouncing the circulation of the\r\nBible, and the general diffusion of knowledge. Turn to every land where\r\npopery predominates, and you will find an ignorant and debased\r\npeasantry, a profligate nobility, and a priesthood, licentious,\r\navaricious, domineering and cruel.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, is popery the same system now as in the days of\r\nCardinal Bonner and the \"Bloody Mary.\" We answer yes. It is the boast of\r\nall catholics that their church never varies, either in spirit or in\r\npractice. For evidence of this, look at the demonstrations of her spirit\r\nin the persecutions in the south of France, for several years after the\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons, in 1814. All have witnessed with feelings\r\nof detestation, the recent efforts of the apostolicals in Spain and\r\nPortugal, to crush the friends of civil and religious liberty in those\r\nill-fated countries. The narrative of Asaad Shidiak, clearly indicates\r\nthat the spirit of popery, has lost none of its ferocity and\r\nbloodthirstiness since the Piedmontese war, and the Bartholomew\r\nmassacre. Where it has power, its victims are still crushed by the same\r\nmeans which filled the dungeons of the inquisition, and fed the fires of\r\nthe _auto de fe_.\r\n\r\nThis is the religion, to diffuse which, strenuous efforts are now making\r\nin this country. Already the papal church numbers more than half a\r\nmillion of communicants. This number is rapidly augmenting by emigration\r\nfrom catholic countries, and by the conversion of protestant children\r\nwho are placed in their schools for instruction. The recent events in\r\nEurope, will, no doubt, send to our shores hundreds of jesuit priests,\r\nwith a portion of that immense revenue which the papal church has\r\nhitherto enjoyed. Another thing, which will, no doubt, favour their\r\nviews, is the disposition manifested among some who style themselves\r\n_liberalists_, to aid catholics in the erection of mass houses,\r\ncolleges, convents and theological seminaries. This has been done in\r\nnumerous instances; and when a note of warning is raised by the true\r\nfriends of civil and religious liberty, they are treated as bigots by\r\nthose very men who are contributing of their substance to diffuse and\r\nfoster the most intolerant system of bigotry, and cruel, unrelenting\r\ndespotism, the world has ever seen. Other sects have persecuted during\r\nsome periods of their history; but all now deny the right, and reprobate\r\nthe practice except catholics. The right to destroy heretics, is a\r\nfundamental article in the creed of the papal church. And wherever her\r\npower is not cramped, she still exercises that power to the destruction\r\nof all who oppose her unrighteous usurpation. All the blood shed by all\r\nother christian sects, is no more in comparison to that shed by the\r\npapacy, than the short lived flow of a feeble rill, raised by the\r\npassing tempest, to the deep overwhelming tide of a mighty river, which\r\nreceives as tributaries, the waters of a thousand streams.\r\n\r\nWe trust the present work, therefore, will prove a salutary check to the\r\nprogress of that system whose practical effects have ever been, and ever\r\nmust be, licentiousness, cruelty, and blood.\r\n\r\nThe narratives of Asaad Shidiak, Mrs. Judson, the persecutions in the\r\nWest Indies, and in Switzerland, have never before been incorporated in\r\nany book of Martyrs. They serve to show the hideous nature of\r\npersecution, and the benefit of christian missions.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this volume will be found a sketch of the French\r\nrevolution of 1789, as connected with persecution. It has long been the\r\npractice of infidels to sneer at christianity, because some of its\r\nnominal followers have exhibited a persecuting spirit. And although they\r\nknew that christianity condemns persecution in the most pointed manner,\r\nyet they have never had the generosity to discriminate between the\r\nsystem, and the abuse of the system by wicked men. Infidelity on the\r\nother hand, has nothing to redeem it. It imposes no restraint on the\r\nviolent and lifelong passions of men. Coming to men with the Circean\r\ntorch of licentiousness in her hand, with fair promises of freedom, she\r\nfirst stupefies the conscience, and brutifies the affections; and then\r\nrenders her votaries the most abject slaves of guilt and crime. This was\r\nexemplified in the French revolution. For centuries, the bible had been\r\ntaken away, and the key of knowledge wrested from the people. For a\r\nlittle moment, France broke the chains which superstition had flung\r\naround her. Not content, however, with this, she attempted to break the\r\nyoke of God: she stamped the bible in the dust, and proclaimed the\r\njubilee of licentiousness, unvisited, either by present or future\r\nretribution. Mark the consequence. Anarchy broke in like a flood, from\r\nwhose boiling surge blood spouted up in living streams, and on whose\r\ntroubled waves floated the headless bodies of the learned, the good, the\r\nbeautiful and the brave. The most merciless proscription for opinion's\r\nsake, followed. A word, a sigh, or a look supposed inimical to the\r\nruling powers, was followed with instant death. The calm which\r\nsucceeded, was only the less dreaded, because it presented fewer objects\r\nof terrific interest, as the shock of the earthquake creates more\r\ninstant alarm, than the midnight pestilence, when it walks unseen,\r\nunknown amidst the habitations of a populous city.\r\n\r\nThe infidel persecutions in France and Switzerland, afford a solemn\r\nlesson to the people of this country. We have men among us now, most of\r\nthem it is true, vagabond foreigners, who are attempting to propagate\r\nthe same sentiments which produced such terrible consequences in France.\r\nUnder various names they are scattering their pestilent doctrines\r\nthrough the country. As in France, they have commenced their attacks\r\nupon the bible, the Sabbath, marriage, and all the social and domestic\r\nrelations of life. With flatteries and lies, they are attempting to sow\r\nthe seeds of discontent and future rebellion among the people. The\r\nferocity of their attacks upon those who differ from them, even while\r\nrestrained by public opinion, shews what they would do, provided they\r\ncould pull down our institutions and introduce disorder and wild\r\nmisrule. We trust, therefore, that the article on the revolution in\r\nFrance, will be found highly instructive and useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CHRISTIAN MARTYRS TO THE FIRST GENERAL PERSECUTIONS UNDER\r\nNERO.\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n Martyrdom of St. Stephen, James the Great, and Philip              16\r\n   Matthew, James the Less, Matthias, Andrew,\r\n     St. Mark and Peter                                             17\r\n   Paul, Jude, Bartholomew, Thomas, Luke, Simon,\r\n     John, and Barnabas                                             18\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE TEN PRIMITIVE PERSECUTIONS.\r\n\r\n The first persecution under Nero, A.

At one time, persecution, as waged against the friends of\r\nChrist, was confined to those without; at another, schisms and divisions\r\nhave arrayed brethren of the same name against each other, and scenes of\r\ncruelty and woe have been exhibited within the sanctuary, rivalling in\r\nhorror the direst cruelties ever inflicted by pagan or barbarian\r\nfanaticism. This, however, instead of implying any defect in the gospel\r\nsystem, which breathes peace and love; only pourtrays in darker colours\r\nthe deep and universal depravity of the human heart. Pure and\r\nunsophisticated morality, especially when attempted to be inculcated on\r\nmankind, as essential to their preserving an interest with their\r\nCreator, have constantly met with opposition. It was this which produced\r\nthe premature death of John the Baptist. It was the cutting charge of\r\nadultery and incest, which excited the resentment of Herodias, who never\r\nceased to persecute him, until she had accomplished his destruction. The\r\nsame observation is equally applicable to the Jewish doctors, in their\r\ntreatment of our blessed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. In the sudden\r\nmartyrdom of John the Baptist, and the crucifixion of our Lord, the\r\nhistory of christian martyrdom must be admitted to commence; and from\r\nthese, as a basis for the subsequent occurrences, we may fairly trace\r\nthe origin of that hostility, which produced so lavish an effusion of\r\nchristian blood, and led to so much slaughter in the progressive state\r\nof christianity.\r\n\r\nAs it is not our business to enlarge upon our Saviour's history, either\r\nbefore or after his crucifixion, we shall only find it necessary to\r\nremind our readers of the discomfiture of the Jews by his subsequent\r\nresurrection. Though one apostle had betrayed him; though another had\r\ndenied him, under the solemn sanction of an oath; and though the rest\r\nhad forsaken him, unless we may except \"the disciple who was known unto\r\nthe high-priest;\" the history of his resurrection gave a new direction\r\nto all their hearts, and, after the mission of the Holy Spirit, imparted\r\nnew confidence to their minds. The powers with which they were endued\r\nemboldened them to proclaim his name, to the confusion of the Jewish\r\nrulers, and the astonishment of Gentile proselytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I. St. Stephen_\r\n\r\nST. STEPHEN suffered the next in order. His death was occasioned by the\r\nfaithful manner in which he preached the gospel to the betrayers and\r\nmurderers of Christ. To such a degree of madness were they excited, that\r\nthey cast him out of the city and stoned him to death. The time when he\r\nsuffered is generally supposed to have been at the passover which\r\nsucceeded to that of our Lord's crucifixion, and to the aera of his\r\nascension, in the following spring.\r\n\r\nUpon this a great persecution was raised against all who professed their\r\nbelief in Christ as the Messiah, or as a prophet. We are immediately\r\ntold by St. Luke, that \"there was a great persecution against the\r\nchurch, which was at Jerusalem;\" and that \"they were all scattered\r\nabroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the\r\napostles.\"\r\n\r\nAbout two thousand christians, with Nicanor, one of the seven deacons,\r\nsuffered martyrdom during the \"persecution which arose about Stephen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_II. James the Great._\r\n\r\nThe next martyr we meet with, according to St. Luke, in the History of\r\nthe Apostles' Acts, was James the son of Zebedee, the elder brother of\r\nJohn, and a relative of our Lord; for his mother Salome was\r\ncousin-german to the Virgin Mary. It was not until ten years after the\r\ndeath of Stephen, that the second martyrdom took place; for no sooner\r\nhad Herod Agrippa been appointed governor of Judea, than, with a view to\r\ningratiate himself with them, he raised a sharp persecution against the\r\nchristians, and determined to make an effectual blow, by striking at\r\ntheir leaders. The account given us by an eminent primitive writer,\r\nClemens Alexandrinus, ought not to be overlooked; that, as James was led\r\nto the place of martyrdom, his accuser was brought to repent of his\r\nconduct by the apostle's extraordinary courage and undauntedness, and\r\nfell down at his feet to request his pardon, professing himself a\r\nchristian, and resolving that James should not receive the crown of\r\nmartyrdom alone. Hence they were both beheaded at the same time. Thus\r\ndid the first apostolic martyr cheerfully and resolutely receive that\r\ncup, which he had told our Saviour he was ready to drink. Timon and\r\nParmenas suffered martyrdom about the same time; the one at Phillippi,\r\nand the other in Macedonia. These events took place A. D. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III. Philip._\r\n\r\nWas born at Bethsaida, in Galilee, and was the first called by the name\r\nof \"Disciple.\" He laboured diligently in Upper Asia, and suffered\r\nmartyrdom at Heliopolis, in Phrygia. He was scourged, thrown into\r\nprison, and afterwards crucified, A. D. 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV. Matthew_,\r\n\r\nWhose occupation was that of a toll-gatherer, was born at Nazareth. He\r\nwrote his gospel in Hebrew, which was afterwards translated into Greek\r\nby James the Less. The scene of his labors was Parthia, and Ethiopia, in\r\nwhich latter country he suffered martyrdom, being slain with a halberd\r\nin the city of Nadabah, A. D. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\n_V. James the Less_,\r\n\r\nIs supposed by some to have been the brother of our Lord, by a former\r\nwife of Joseph. This is very doubtful, and accords too much with the\r\ncatholic superstition, that Mary never had any other children except our\r\nSaviour. He was elected to the oversight of the churches of Jerusalem;\r\nand was the author of the epistle ascribed to James in the sacred canon.\r\nAt the age of ninety-four, he was beat and stoned by the Jews; and\r\nfinally had his brains dashed out with a fuller's club.\r\n\r\n\r\n_VI. Matthias_,\r\n\r\nOf whom less is known than of most of the other disciples, was elected\r\nto fill the vacant place of Judas. He was stoned at Jerusalem and then\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_VII. Andrew_,\r\n\r\nWas the brother of Peter. He preached the gospel to many Asiatic\r\nnations; but on his arrival at Edessa, he was taken and crucified on a\r\ncross, the two ends of which were fixed transversely in the ground.\r\nHence the derivation of the term, St. Andrew's Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n_VIII. St. Mark_,\r\n\r\nWas born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He is supposed to have\r\nbeen converted to christianity by Peter, whom he served as an\r\namanuensis, and under whose inspection he wrote his gospel in the Greek\r\nlanguage. Mark was dragged to pieces by the people of Alexandria, at the\r\ngreat solemnity of Serapis their idol, ending his life under their\r\nmerciless hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IX. Peter_,\r\n\r\nWas born at Bethsaida, in Galilee. He was by occupation a fisherman.\r\nChrist gave him a name which in Syriac implies a rock. Peter is supposed\r\nto have suffered martyrdom at Rome, during the reign of the emperor\r\nNero, being crucified with his head downward, at his own request.\r\n\r\n[It is, however, very uncertain, whether Peter ever visited Rome at all.\r\nThe evidence rather favouring the supposition that he ended his days in\r\nsome other country.--_Ed._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_X. Paul_,\r\n\r\nThe great apostle of the Gentiles, was a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, a\r\nnative of Tarsus in Cilicia, and before his conversion was called Saul.\r\nAfter suffering various persecutions at Jerusalem, Iconium, Lystra,\r\nPhillippi and Thessalonica, he was carried prisoner to Rome, where he\r\ncontinued for two years, and was then released. He afterwards visited\r\nthe churches of Greece and Rome, and preached the gospel in Spain and\r\nFrance, but returning to Rome, he was apprehended by order of Nero, and\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_XI. Jude_,\r\n\r\nThe brother of James, was commonly called Thaddeus. He was crucified at\r\nEdessa, A. D. 72.\r\n\r\n\r\n_XII. Bartholomew_,\r\n\r\nPreached in several countries, and having translated the gospel of\r\nMatthew into the language of India, he propagated it in that country. He\r\nwas at length cruelly beaten and then crucified by the impatient\r\nidolaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_XIII. Thomas_,\r\n\r\nCalled Didymus, preached the gospel in Parthia and India, where exciting\r\nthe rage of the pagan priests, he was martyred by being thrust through\r\nwith a spear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_XIV. Luke_,\r\n\r\nThe evangelist, was the author of the gospel which goes under his name.\r\nHe travelled with Paul through various countries, and is supposed to\r\nhave been hanged on an olive tree, by the idolatrous priests of Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\n_XV. Simon_,\r\n\r\nSurnamed Zelotes, preached the gospel in Mauritania, Africa, and even in\r\nBritain, which latter country he was crucified, A. D. 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n_XVI. John_,\r\n\r\nThe \"beloved disciple,\" was brother to James the Great. The churches of\r\nSmyrna, Pergamos, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, and Thyatira, were\r\nfounded by him. From Ephesus he was ordered to be sent to Rome, where it\r\nis affirmed he was cast into a cauldron of boiling oil. He escaped by\r\nmiracle, without injury. Domitian afterwards banished him to the Isle of\r\nPatmos, where he wrote the Book of Revelation. Nerva, the successor of\r\nDomitian, recalled him. He was the only apostle who escaped a violent\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n_XVII. Barnabas_,\r\n\r\nWas of Cyprus, but of Jewish descent, his death is supposed to have\r\ntaken place about A. D. 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEN PRIMITIVE PERSECUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Persecution under Nero, A. D. 67._\r\n\r\nThe first persecution of the church took place in the year 67, under\r\nNero, the sixth emperor of Rome. This monarch reigned for the space of\r\nfive years, with tolerable credit to himself, but then gave way to the\r\ngreatest extravagancy of temper, and to the most atrocious barbarities.\r\nAmong other diabolical whims, he ordered that the city of Rome should be\r\nset on fire, which order was executed by his officers, guards, and\r\nservants. While the imperial city was in flames, he went up to the tower\r\nof Macaenas, played upon his harp, sung the song of the burning of Troy,\r\nand openly declared, \"That he wished the ruin of all things before his\r\ndeath.\" Besides the noble pile, called the circus, many other palaces\r\nand houses were consumed; several thousands perished in the flames, were\r\nsmothered in the smoke, or buried beneath the ruins.\r\n\r\nThis dreadful conflagration continued nine days; when Nero, finding that\r\nhis conduct was greatly blamed, and a severe odium cast upon him,\r\ndetermined to lay the whole upon the christians, at once to excuse\r\nhimself, and have an opportunity of glutting his sight with new\r\ncruelties. This was the occasion of the first persecution; and the\r\nbarbarities exercised on the christians were such as even excited the\r\ncommisseration of the Romans themselves. Nero even refined upon cruelty,\r\nand contrived all manner of punishments for the christians that the most\r\ninfernal imagination could design. In particular, he had some sewed up\r\nin the skins of wild beasts, and then worried by dogs till they expired;\r\nand others dressed in shirts made stiff with wax, fixed to axletrees,\r\nand set on fire in his gardens, in order to illuminate them. This\r\npersecution was general throughout the whole Roman empire; but it rather\r\nincreased than diminished the spirit of christianity. In the course of\r\nit, St. Paul and St. Peter were martyred.\r\n\r\nTo their names may be added, Erastus, chamberlain of Corinth;\r\nAristarchus, the Macedonian; and Trophimus, an Ephesian, converted by\r\nSt. Paul, and fellow-labourer with him; Joseph, commonly called\r\nBarsabas; and Ananias, bishop of Damascus; each of the seventy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Second Persecution, under Domitian, A. D. 81._\r\n\r\nThe emperor Domitian, who was naturally inclined to cruelty, first slew\r\nhis brother, and then raised the second persecution against the\r\nchristians. In his rage he put to death some of the Roman senators, some\r\nthrough malice; and others to confiscate their estates. He then\r\ncommanded all the lineage of David to be put to death.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous martyrs that suffered during this persecution was\r\nSimeon, bishop of Jerusalem, who was crucified; and St. John, who was\r\nboiled in oil, and afterward banished to Patmos. Flavia, the daughter of\r\na Roman senator, was likewise banished to Pontus; and a law was made,\r\n\"That no christian, once brought before the tribunal, should be exempted\r\nfrom punishment without renouncing his religion.\"\r\n\r\nA variety of fabricated tales were, during this reign, composed in order\r\nto injure the christians. Such was the infatuation of the pagans, that,\r\nif famine, pestilence, or earthquakes afflicted any of the Roman\r\nprovinces, it was laid upon the christians. These persecutions among the\r\nchristians increased the number of informers and many, for the sake of\r\ngain, swore away the lives of the innocent.\r\n\r\nAnother hardship was, that, when any christians were brought before the\r\nmagistrates, a test oath was proposed, when, if they refused to take it,\r\ndeath was pronounced against them; and if they confessed themselves\r\nchristians, the sentence was the same.\r\n\r\nThe following were the most remarkable among the numerous martyrs who\r\nsuffered during this persecution.\r\n\r\nDionysius, the Areopagite, was an Athenian by birth, and educated in all\r\nthe useful and ornamental literature of Greece. He then travelled to\r\nEgypt to study astronomy, and made very particular observations on the\r\ngreat and supernatural eclipse, which happened at the time of our\r\nSaviour's crucifixion.\r\n\r\nThe sanctity of his conversation, and the purity of his manners,\r\nrecommended him so strongly to the christians in general, that he was\r\nappointed bishop of Athens.\r\n\r\nNicodemus, a benevolent christian of some distinction, suffered at Rome\r\nduring the rage of Domitian's persecution.\r\n\r\nProtasius and Gervasius were martyred at Milan.\r\n\r\nTimothy was the celebrated disciple of St. Paul, and bishop of Ephesus,\r\nwhere he zealously governed the church till A. D. 97. At this period, as\r\nthe pagans were about to celebrate a feast called Catagogion, Timothy,\r\nmeeting the procession, severely reproved them for their ridiculous\r\nidolatry, which so exasperated the people, that they fell upon him with\r\ntheir clubs, and beat him in so dreadful a manner, that he expired of\r\nthe bruises two days after.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Third Persecution, under Trajan, A. D. 108._\r\n\r\nNerva, succeeding Domitian, gave a respite to the sufferings of the\r\nchristians; but reigning only thirteen months, his successor Trajan, in\r\nthe tenth year of his reign A. D. 108, began the third persecution\r\nagainst the christians. While the persecution raged, Pliny 2d, a heathen\r\nphilosopher wrote to the emperor in favor of the Christians; to whose\r\nepistle Trajan returned this indecisive answer: \"The christians ought\r\nnot to be sought after, but when brought before the magistracy, they\r\nshould be punished.\" Trajan, however, soon after wrote to Jerusalem, and\r\ngave orders to his officers to exterminate the stock of David; in\r\nconsequence of which, all that could be found of that race were put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nSymphorosa, a widow, and her seven sons, were commanded by the emperor\r\nto sacrifice to the heathen deities. She was carried to the temple of\r\nHercules, scourged, and hung up, for some time, by the hair of her head:\r\nthen being taken down, a large stone was fastened to her neck, and she\r\nwas thrown into the river, where she expired. With respect to the sons,\r\nthey were fastened to seven posts, and being drawn up by pullies, their\r\nlimbs were dislocated: these tortures, not affecting their resolution,\r\nthey were martyred by stabbing, except Eugenius, the youngest, who was\r\nsawed asunder.\r\n\r\nPhocas, bishop of Pontus, refusing to sacrifice to Neptune, was, by the\r\nimmediate order of Trajan, cast first into a hot lime-kiln, and then\r\nthrown into a scalding bath till he expired.\r\n\r\nTrajan likewise commanded the martyrdom of Ignatius, bishop of Antioch.\r\nThis holy man was the person whom, when an infant, Christ took into his\r\narms, and showed to his disciples, as one that would be a pattern of\r\nhumility and innocence. He received the gospel afterward from St. John\r\nthe Evangelist, and was exceedingly zealous in his mission. He boldly\r\nvindicated the faith of Christ before the emperor, for which he was cast\r\ninto prison, and tormented in a most cruel manner. After being\r\ndreadfully scourged, he was compelled to hold fire in his hands, and, at\r\nthe same time, papers clipped in oil were put to his sides, and set on\r\nfire. His flesh was then torn with red hot pincers, and at last he was\r\ndespatched by being torn to pieces by wild beasts.\r\n\r\nTrajan being succeeded by Adrian, the latter continued this third\r\npersecution with as much severity as his predecessor. About this time\r\nAlexander, bishop of Rome, with his two deacons, were martyred; as were\r\nQuirinus and Hernes, with their families; Zenon, a Roman nobleman, and\r\nabout ten thousand other christians.\r\n\r\nIn Mount Ararat many were crucified, crowned with thorns, and spears run\r\ninto their sides, in imitation of Christ's passion. Eustachius, a brave\r\nand successful Roman commander, was by the emperor ordered to join in an\r\nidolatrous sacrifice to celebrate some of his own victories; but his\r\nfaith (being a christian in his heart) was so much greater than his\r\nvanity, that he nobly refused it. Enraged at the denial, the ungrateful\r\nemperor forgot the service of this skilful commander, and ordered him\r\nand his whole family to be martyred.\r\n\r\nAt the martyrdom of Faustines and Jovita, brothers and citizens of\r\nBrescia, their torments were so many, and their patience so great, that\r\nCalocerius, a pagan, beholding them, was struck with admiration, and\r\nexclaimed in a kind of ecstacy, \"Great is the God of the christians!\"\r\nfor which he was apprehended, and suffered a similar fate.\r\n\r\nMany other similar cruelties and rigours were exercised against the\r\nchristians, until Quadratus, bishop of Athens, made a learned apology\r\nin their favour before the emperor, who happened to be there and\r\nAristides, a philosopher of the same city, wrote an elegant epistle,\r\nwhich caused Adrian to relax in his severities, and relent in their\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nAdrian dying A. D. 138, was succeeded by Antoninus Pius, one of the most\r\namiable monarchs that ever reigned, and who stayed the persecution\r\nagainst the Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The fourth persecution, under Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, A. D. 162._\r\n\r\nThis commenced A. D. 162, under Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Philosophus, a\r\nstrong pagan.\r\n\r\nThe cruelties used in this persecution were such, that many of the\r\nspectators shuddered with horror at the sight, and were astonished at\r\nthe intrepidity of the sufferers. Some of the martyrs were obliged to\r\npass, with their already wounded feet, over thorns, nails, sharp shells,\r\n&c. upon their points, others were scourged till their sinews and veins\r\nlay bare, and after suffering the most excruciating tortures that could\r\nbe devised, they were destroyed by the most terrible deaths.\r\n\r\nGermanicus, a young man, but a true christian, being delivered to the\r\nwild beasts on account of his faith, behaved with such astonishing\r\ncourage, that several pagans became converts to a faith which inspired\r\nsuch fortitude.\r\n\r\nPolycarp, the venerable bishop of Smyrna, hearing that persons were\r\nseeking for him, escaped, but was discovered by a child. After feasting\r\nthe guards who apprehended him, he desired an hour in prayer, which\r\nbeing allowed, he prayed with such fervency, that his guards repented\r\nthat they had been instrumental in taking him. He was, however, carried\r\nbefore the proconsul, condemned, and burnt in the market-place. Twelve\r\nother christians, who had been intimate with Polycarp, were soon after\r\nmartyred.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending the execution of this venerable old man, as\r\nthey were of no common nature, so it would be injurious to the credit of\r\nour professed history of martyrdom to pass them over in silence. It was\r\nobserved by the spectators, that, after finishing his prayer at the\r\nstake, to which he was only tied, but not nailed as usual, as he assured\r\nthem he should stand immoveable, the flames, on their kindling the\r\nfagots, encircled his body, like an arch, without touching him; and the\r\nexecutioner, on seeing this, was ordered to pierce him with a sword,\r\nwhen so great a quantity of blood flowed out as extinguished the fire.\r\nBut his body, at the instigation of the enemies of the gospel,\r\nespecially Jews, was ordered to be consumed in the pile, and the request\r\nof his friends, who wished to give it christian burial, rejected. They\r\nnevertheless collected his bones and as much of his remains as possible,\r\nand caused them to be decently interred.\r\n\r\nMetrodorus, a minister, who preached boldly; and Pionius, who made some\r\nexcellent apologies for the christian faith; were likewise burnt. Carpus\r\nand Papilus, two worthy christians, and Agathonica, a pious woman,\r\nsuffered martyrdom at Pergamopolis, in Asia.\r\n\r\nFelicitatis, an illustrious Roman lady, of a considerable family and\r\nthe most shining virtues, was a devout christian. She had seven sons,\r\nwhom she had educated with the most exemplary piety.\r\n\r\nJanuarius, the eldest, was scourged, and pressed to death with weights;\r\nFelix and Philip, the two next had their brains dashed out with clubs;\r\nSilvanus, the fourth, was murdered by being thrown from a precipice; and\r\nthe three younger sons, Alexander, Vitalis, and Martial, were beheaded.\r\nThe mother was beheaded with the same sword as the three latter.\r\n\r\nJustin, the celebrated philosopher, fell a martyr in this persecution.\r\nHe was a native of Neapolis, in Samaria, and was born A. D. 103. Justin\r\nwas a great lover of truth, and a universal scholar; he investigated the\r\nStoic and Peripatetic philosophy, and attempted the Pythagorean; but the\r\nbehaviour of one of its professors disgusting him, he applied himself to\r\nthe Platonic, in which he took great delight. About the year 133, when\r\nhe was thirty years of age, he became a convert to christianity, and\r\nthen, for the first time, perceived the real nature of truth.\r\n\r\nHe wrote an elegant epistle to the Gentiles, and employed his talents in\r\nconvincing the Jews of the truth of the christian rites; spending a\r\ngreat deal of time in travelling, till he took up his abode in Rome, and\r\nfixed his habitation upon the Viminal mount.\r\n\r\nHe kept a public school, taught many who afterward became great men, and\r\nwrote a treatise to confute heresies of all kinds. As the pagans began\r\nto treat the christians with great severity, Justin wrote his first\r\napology in their favour. This piece displays great learning and genius,\r\nand occasioned the emperor to publish an edict in favor of the\r\nchristians.\r\n\r\nSoon after, he entered into frequent contests with Crescens, a person of\r\na vicious life and conversation, but a celebrated cynic philosopher; and\r\nhis arguments appeared so powerful, yet disgusting to the cynic, that he\r\nresolved on, and in the sequel accomplished, his destruction.\r\n\r\nThe second apology of Justin, upon certain severities, gave Crescens the\r\ncynic an opportunity of prejudicing the emperor against the writer of\r\nit; upon which Justin, and six of his companions, were apprehended.\r\nBeing commanded to sacrifice to the pagan idols, they refused, and were\r\ncondemned to be scourged, and then beheaded; which sentence was executed\r\nwith all imaginable severity.\r\n\r\nSeveral were beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to the image of Jupiter;\r\nin particular Concordus, a deacon of the city of Spolito.\r\n\r\nSome of the restless northern nations having risen in arms against Rome,\r\nthe emperor marched to encounter them. He was, however, drawn into an\r\nambuscade, and dreaded the loss of his whole army. Enveloped with\r\nmountains, surrounded by enemies, and perishing with thirst, the pagan\r\ndeities were invoked in vain; when the men belonging to the militine, or\r\nthundering legion, who were all christians, were commanded to call upon\r\ntheir God for succour. A miraculous deliverance immediately ensued; a\r\nprodigious quantity of rain fell, which, being caught by the men, and\r\nfilling their dykes, afforded a sudden and astonishing relief. It\r\nappears, that the storm which miraculously flashed in the faces of the\r\nenemy, so intimidated them, that part deserted to the Roman army; the\r\nrest were defeated, and the revolted provinces entirely recovered.\r\n\r\nThis affair occasioned the persecution to subside for some time, at\r\nleast in those parts immediately under the inspection of the emperor;\r\nbut we find that it soon after raged in France, particularly at Lyons,\r\nwhere the tortures to which many of the christians were put, almost\r\nexceed the powers of description.\r\n\r\nThe principal of these martyrs were Vetius Agathus, a young man;\r\nBlandina, a christian lady, of a weak constitution; Sanctus, a deacon of\r\nVienna; red hot plates of brass were placed upon the tenderest parts of\r\nhis body; Biblias, a weak woman, once an apostate. Attalus, of Pergamus;\r\nand Pothinus, the venerable bishop of Lyons, who was ninety years of\r\nage. Blandina, on the day when she and the three other champions were\r\nfirst brought into the amphitheatre, she was suspended on a piece of\r\nwood fixed in the ground, and exposed as food for the wild beasts; at\r\nwhich time, by her earnest prayers, she encouraged others. But none of\r\nthe wild beasts would touch her, so that she was remanded to prison.\r\nWhen she was again produced for the third and last time, she was\r\naccompanied by Ponticus, a youth of fifteen and the constancy of their\r\nfaith so enraged the multitude, that neither the sex of the one nor the\r\nyouth of the other were respected, being exposed to all manner of\r\npunishments and tortures. Being strengthened by Blandina, he persevered\r\nunto death; and she, after enduring all the torments heretofore\r\nmentioned, was at length slain with the sword.\r\n\r\nWhen the christians, upon these occasions, received martyrdom, they were\r\nornamented, and crowned with garlands of flowers; for which they, in\r\nheaven, received eternal crowns of glory.\r\n\r\nThe torments were various; and, exclusive of those already mentioned,\r\nthe martyrs of Lyons were compelled to sit in red-hot iron chairs till\r\ntheir flesh broiled. This was inflicted with peculiar severity on\r\nSanctus, already mentioned, and some others. Some were sewed up in nets,\r\nand thrown on the horns of wild bulls; and the carcases of those who\r\ndied in prison, previous to the appointed time of execution, were thrown\r\nto dogs. Indeed, so far did the malice of the pagans proceed that they\r\nset guards over the bodies while the beasts were devouring them, lest\r\nthe friends of the deceased should get them away by stealth; and the\r\noffals left by the dogs were ordered to be burnt.\r\n\r\nThe martyrs of Lyons, according to the best accounts we could obtain,\r\nwho suffered for the gospel, were forty-eight in number, and their\r\nexecutions happened in the year of Christ 177.\r\n\r\nEpipodius and Alexander were celebrated for their great friendship, and\r\ntheir christian union with each other. The first was born at Lyons, the\r\nlatter at Greece. Epipodius, being compassionated by the governor of\r\nLyons, and exhorted to join in their festive pagan worship, replied,\r\n\"Your pretended tenderness is actually cruelty; and the agreeable life\r\nyou describe is replete with everlasting death Christ suffered for us,\r\nthat our pleasures should be immortal, and hath prepared for his\r\nfollowers an eternity of bliss. The frame of man being composed of two\r\nparts, body and soul, the first, as mean and perishable, should be\r\nrendered subservient to the interests of the last. Your idolatrous\r\nfeasts may gratify the mortal, but they injure the immortal part; that\r\ncannot therefore be enjoying life which destroys the most valuable\r\nmoiety of your frame. Your pleasures lead to eternal death, and our\r\npains to perpetual happiness.\" Epipodius was severely beaten, and then\r\nput to the rack, upon which being stretched, his flesh was torn with\r\niron hooks. Having borne his torments with incredible patience and\r\nunshaken fortitude, he was taken from the rack and beheaded.\r\n\r\nValerian and Marcellus, who were nearly related to each other, were\r\nimprisoned at Lyons, in the year 177, for being christians. The father\r\nwas fixed up to the waist in the ground; in which position, after\r\nremaining three days, he expired, A. D. 179. Valerian was beheaded.\r\n\r\nApollonius, a Roman senator, an accomplished gentleman, and a sincere\r\nchristian, suffered under Commodus, because he would not worship him as\r\nHercules.\r\n\r\nEusebius, Vincentius, Potentianus, Peregrinus, and Julius, a Roman\r\nsenator, were martyred on the same account.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fifth Persecution, commencing with Severus, A. D. 192._\r\n\r\nSeverus, having been recovered from a severe fit of sickness by a\r\nchristian, became a great favourer of the christians in general; but the\r\nprejudice and fury of the ignorant multitude prevailing, obsolete laws\r\nwere put in execution against the christians. The progress of\r\nchristianity alarmed the pagans, and they revived the stale calumny of\r\nplacing accidental misfortunes to the account of its professors, A. D.\r\n192.\r\n\r\nBut, though persecuting malice raged, yet the gospel shone with\r\nresplendent brightness; and, firm as an impregnable rock, withstood the\r\nattacks of its boisterous enemies with success. Turtullian, who lived in\r\nthis age, informs us, that if the christians had collectively withdrawn\r\nthemselves from the Roman territories, the empire would have been\r\ngreatly depopulated.\r\n\r\nVictor, bishop of Rome, suffered martyrdom in the first year of the\r\nthird century, A. D. 201. Leonidus, the father of the celebrated Origen,\r\nwas beheaded for being a christian. Many of Origen's hearers likewise\r\nsuffered martyrdom; particularly two brothers, named Plutarchus and\r\nSerenus; another Serenus, Heron, and Heraclides, were beheaded. Rhais\r\nhad boiled pitch poured upon her head, and was then burnt, as was\r\nMarcella her mother. Potamiena, the sister of Rhais, was executed in the\r\nsame manner as Rhais had been; but Basilides, an officer belonging to\r\nthe army, and ordered to attend her execution, became her convert.\r\n\r\nBasilides being, as an officer, required to take a certain oath,\r\nrefused, saying, that he could not swear by the Roman idols, as he was a\r\nchristian. Struck with surprise, the people could not, at first, believe\r\nwhat they heard; but he had no sooner confirmed the same, than he was\r\ndragged before the judge, committed to prison, and speedily afterward\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\nIrenaeus, bishop of Lyons, was born in Greece, and received both a polite\r\nand a christian education. It is generally supposed, that the account of\r\nthe persecutions at Lyons was written by himself. He succeeded the\r\nmartyr Pothinus as bishop of Lyons, and ruled his diocese with great\r\npropriety; he was a zealous opposer of heresies in general, and, about\r\nA. D. 187, he wrote a celebrated tract against heresy. Victor, the\r\nbishop of Rome, wanting to impose the keeping of Easter there, in\r\npreference to other places, it occasioned some disorders among the\r\nchristians. In particular, Irenaeus wrote him a synodical epistle, in the\r\nname of the Gallic churches. This zeal, in favour of christianity,\r\npointed him out as an object of resentment to the emperor; and in A. D.\r\n202, he was beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe persecutions now extending to Africa, many were martyred in that\r\nquarter of the globe; the most particular of whom we shall mention.\r\n\r\nPerpetua, a married lady, of about twenty-two years. Those who suffered\r\nwith her were, Felicitas, a married lady, big with child at the time of\r\nher being apprehended; and Revocatus, catechumen of Carthage, and a\r\nslave. The names of the other prisoners, destined to suffer upon this\r\noccasion, were Saturninus, Secundulus and Satur. On the day appointed\r\nfor their execution, they were led to the amphitheatre. Satur,\r\nSaturninus, and Revocatus, were ordered to run the gauntlet between the\r\nhunters, or such as had the care of the wild beasts. The hunters being\r\ndrawn up in two ranks, they ran between, and were severely lashed as\r\nthey passed. Felicitas and Perpetua were stripped, in order to be thrown\r\nto a mad bull, which made his first attack upon Perpetua, and stunned\r\nher; he then darted at Felicitas, and gored her dreadfully; but not\r\nkilling them, the executioner did that office with a sword. Revocatus\r\nand Satur were destroyed by wild beasts; Saturninus was beheaded; and\r\nSecundulus died in prison. These executions were in the year 205, on the\r\n8th day of March.\r\n\r\nSperatus, and twelve others, were likewise beheaded; as was Andocles in\r\nFrance. Asclepiades, bishop of Antioch, suffered many tortures, but his\r\nlife was spared.\r\n\r\nCecilia, a young lady of good family in Rome, was married to a gentleman\r\nnamed Valerian. She converted her husband and brother, who were\r\nbeheaded; and the maximus, or officer, who led them to execution,\r\nbecoming their convert, suffered the same fate. The lady was placed\r\nnaked in a scalding bath, and having continued there a considerable\r\ntime, her head was struck off with a sword, A. D. 222.\r\n\r\nCalistus, bishop of Rome, was martyred, A. D. 224; but the manner of\r\nhis death is not recorded; and Urban, bishop of Rome, met the same fate\r\nA. D. 232.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sixth Persecution, under Maximinus, A. D. 235._\r\n\r\nA. D. 235, was in the time of Maximinus. In Cappadocia, the president,\r\nSeremianus, did all he could to exterminate the christians from that\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe principal persons who perished under this reign were Pontianus,\r\nbishop of Rome; Anteros, a Grecian, his successor, who gave offence to\r\nthe government, by collecting the acts of the martyrs, Pammachius and\r\nQuiritus, Roman senators, with all their families, and many other\r\nchristians; Simplicius, senator; Calepodius, a christian minister,\r\nthrown into the Tyber; Martina, a noble and beautiful virgin; and\r\nHippolitus, a christian prelate, tied to a wild horse, and dragged till\r\nhe expired.\r\n\r\nDuring this persecution, raised by Maximinus, numberless christians were\r\nslain without trial, and buried indiscriminately in heaps, sometimes\r\nfifty or sixty being cast into a pit together, without the least\r\ndecency.\r\n\r\nThe tyrant Maximinus dying, A. D. 238, was succeeded by Gordian, during\r\nwhose reign, and that of his successor Philip, the church was free from\r\npersecution for the space of more than ten years; but A. D. 249, a\r\nviolent persecution broke out in Alexandria, at the instigation of a\r\npagan priest, without the knowledge of the emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Seventh Persecution, under Decius A. D. 249._\r\n\r\nThis was occasioned partly by the hatred he bore to his predecessor\r\nPhilip, who was deemed a christian, and partly to his jealousy\r\nconcerning the amazing increase of christianity; for the heathen temples\r\nbegan to be forsaken, and the christian churches thronged.\r\n\r\nThese reasons stimulated Decius to attempt the very extirpation of the\r\nname of christian; and it was unfortunate for the gospel, that many\r\nerrors had, about this time, crept into the church: the christians were\r\nat variance with each other; self-interest divided those whom social\r\nlove ought to have united; and the virulence of pride occasioned a\r\nvariety of factions.\r\n\r\nThe heathens in general were ambitious to enforce the imperial decrees\r\nupon this occasion, and looked upon the murder of a christian as a merit\r\nto themselves. The martyrs, upon this occasion, were innumerable; but\r\nthe principal we shall give some account of.\r\n\r\nFabian, the bishop of Rome, was the first person of eminence who felt\r\nthe severity of this persecution. The deceased emperor, Philip, had, on\r\naccount of his integrity, committed his treasure to the care of this\r\ngood man. But Decius, not finding as much as his avarice made him\r\nexpect, determined to wreak his vengeance on the good prelate. He was\r\naccordingly seized; and on the 20th of January, A. D. 250, he suffered\r\ndecapitation.\r\n\r\nJulian, a native of Cilicia, as we are informed by St. Chrysostom, was\r\nseized upon for being a christian. He was put into a leather bag,\r\ntogether with a number of serpents and scorpions, and in that condition\r\nthrown into the sea.\r\n\r\nPeter, a young man, amiable for the superior qualities of his body and\r\nmind, was beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to Venus. He said, \"I am\r\nastonished you should sacrifice to an infamous woman, whose debaucheries\r\neven your own historians record, and whose life consisted of such\r\nactions as your laws would punish.--No, I shall offer the true God the\r\nacceptable sacrifice of praises and prayers.\" Optimus, the proconsul of\r\nAsia, on hearing this, ordered the prisoner to be stretched upon a\r\nwheel, by which all his bones were broken, and then he was sent to be\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\nNichomachus, being brought before the proconsul as a christian, was\r\nordered to sacrifice to the pagan idols. Nichomachus replied, \"I cannot\r\npay that respect to devils, which is only due to the Almighty.\" This\r\nspeech so much enraged the proconsul, that Nichomachus was put to the\r\nrack. After enduring the torments for a time, he recanted; but scarcely\r\nhad he given this proof of his frailty, than he fell into the greatest\r\nagonies, dropped down on the ground, and expired immediately.\r\n\r\nDenisa, a young woman of only sixteen years of age, who beheld this\r\nterrible judgment, suddenly exclaimed, \"O unhappy wretch, why would you\r\nbuy a moment's ease at the expense of a miserable eternity!\" Optimus,\r\nhearing this, called to her, and Denisa avowing herself to be a\r\nchristian, she was beheaded, by his order, soon after.\r\n\r\nAndrew and Paul, two companions of Nichomachus the martyr, A. D. 251,\r\nsuffered martyrdom by stoning, and expired, calling on their blessed\r\nRedeemer.\r\n\r\nAlexander and Epimachus, of Alexandria, were apprehended for being\r\nchristians: and, confessing the accusation, were beat with staves, torn\r\nwith hooks, and at length burnt in the fire; and we are informed, in a\r\nfragment preserved by Eusebius, that four female martyrs suffered on the\r\nsame day, and at the same place, but not in the same manner; for these\r\nwere beheaded.\r\n\r\nLucian and Marcian, two wicked pagans, though skilful magicians,\r\nbecoming converts to christianity, to make amends for their former\r\nerrors, lived the lives of hermits, and subsisted upon bread and water\r\nonly. After some time spent in this manner, they became zealous\r\npreachers, and made many converts. The persecution, however, raging at\r\nthis time, they were seized upon, and carried before Sabinus, the\r\ngovernor of Bithynia. On being asked by what authority they took upon\r\nthemselves to preach, Lucian answered, \"That the laws of charity and\r\nhumanity obliged all men to endeavour the conversion of their\r\nneighbours, and to do every thing in their power to rescue them from the\r\nsnares of the devil.\"\r\n\r\nLucian having answered in this manner, Marcian said, that \"Then\r\nconversion was by the same grace which was given to St. Paul, who, from\r\na zealous persecutor of the church, became a preacher of the gospel.\"\r\n\r\nThe proconsul, finding that he could not prevail with them to renounce\r\ntheir faith, condemned them to be burnt alive, which sentence was soon\r\nafter executed.\r\n\r\nTrypho and Respicius, two eminent men, were seized as Christians, and\r\nimprisoned at Nice. Their feet were pierced with nails; they were\r\ndragged through the streets, scourged, torn with iron hooks, scorched\r\nwith lighted torches, and at length beheaded, February 1, A. D. 251.\r\n\r\nAgatha, a Sicilian lady, was not more remarkable for her personal and\r\nacquired endowments, than her piety: her beauty was such, that Quintian,\r\ngovernor of Sicily, became enamoured of her, and made many attempts upon\r\nher chastity without success.\r\n\r\nIn order to gratify his passions with the greater conveniency, he put\r\nthe virtuous lady into the hands of Aphrodica, a very infamous and\r\nlicentious woman. This wretch tried every artifice to win her to the\r\ndesired prostitution; but found all her efforts were vain; for her\r\nchastity was impregnable, and she well knew that virtue alone could\r\nprocure true happiness. Aphrodica acquainted Quintian with the\r\ninefficacy of her endeavours, who, enraged to be foiled in his designs,\r\nchanged his lust into resentment. On her confessing that she was a\r\nchristian, he determined to gratify his revenge, as he could not his\r\npassion. Pursuant to his orders, she was scourged, burnt with red-hot\r\nirons, and torn with sharp hooks. Having borne these torments with\r\nadmirable fortitude, she was next laid naked upon live coals,\r\nintermingled with glass, and then being carried back to prison, she\r\nthere expired on the 5th of Feb. 251.\r\n\r\nCyril, bishop of Gortyna, was seized by order of Lucius, the governor of\r\nthat place, who, nevertheless, exhorted him to obey the imperial\r\nmandate, perform the sacrifices, and save his venerable person from\r\ndestruction; for he was now eighty-four years of age. The good prelate\r\nreplied, that as he had long taught others to save their souls, he\r\nshould only think now of his own salvation. The worthy prelate heard his\r\nfiery sentence without emotion, walked cheerfully to the place of\r\nexecution, and underwent his martyrdom with great fortitude.\r\n\r\nThe persecution raged in no place more than the Island of Crete; for the\r\ngovernor, being exceedingly active in executing the imperial decrees,\r\nthat place streamed with pious blood.\r\n\r\nBabylas, a christian of a liberal education, became bishop of Antioch,\r\nA. D. 237, on the demise of Zebinus. He acted with inimitable zeal, and\r\ngoverned the church with admirable prudence during the most tempestuous\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe first misfortune that happened to Antioch during his mission, was\r\nthe siege of it by Sapor, king of Persia; who, having overrun all Syria,\r\ntook and plundered this city among others, and used the christian\r\ninhabitants with greater severity than the rest, but was soon totally\r\ndefeated by Gordian.\r\n\r\nAfter Gordian's death, in the reign of Decius, that emperor came to\r\nAntioch, where, having a desire to visit an assembly of christians,\r\nBabylas opposed him, and absolutely refused to let him come in. The\r\nemperor dissembled his anger at that time; but soon sending for the\r\nbishop, he sharply reproved him for his insolence, and then ordered him\r\nto sacrifice to the pagan deities as an expiation for his offence. This\r\nbeing refused, he was committed to prison, loaded with chains, treated\r\nwith great severities, and then beheaded, together with three young men\r\nwho had been his pupils. A. D. 251.\r\n\r\nAlexander, bishop of Jerusalem, about this time was cast into prison on\r\naccount of his religion, where he died through the severity of his\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nJulianus, an old man, lame with the gout, and Cronion, another\r\nchristian, were bound on the backs of camels, severely scourged, and\r\nthen thrown into a fire and consumed. Also forty virgins, at Antioch,\r\nafter being imprisoned and scourged, were burnt.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 251, the emperor Decius having erected a pagan\r\ntemple at Ephesus, he commanded all who were in that city to sacrifice\r\nto the idols. This order was nobly refused by seven of his own soldiers,\r\nviz. Maximianus, Martianus, Joannes, Malchus, Dionysius, Seraion, and\r\nConstantinus. The emperor wishing to win these soldiers to renounce\r\ntheir faith by his entreaties and lenity, gave them a considerable\r\nrespite till he returned from an expedition. During the emperor's\r\nabsence, they escaped, and hid themselves in a cavern; which the emperor\r\nbeing informed of at his return, the mouth of the cave was closed up,\r\nand they all perished with hunger.\r\n\r\nTheodora, a beautiful young lady of Antioch, on refusing to sacrifice to\r\nthe Roman idols, was condemned to the stews, that her virtue might be\r\nsacrificed to the brutality of lust. Didymus, a christian, disguised\r\nhimself in the habit of a Roman soldier, went to the house, informed\r\nTheodora who he was, and advised her to make her escape in his clothes.\r\nThis being effected, and a man found in the brothel instead of a\r\nbeautiful lady, Didymus was taken before the president, to whom\r\nconfessing the truth, and owning that he was a christian the sentence of\r\ndeath was immediately pronounced against him. Theodora, hearing that her\r\ndeliverer was likely to suffer, came to the judge, threw herself at his\r\nfeet, and begged that the sentence might fall on her as the guilty\r\nperson; but, deaf to the cries of the innocent, and insensible to the\r\ncalls of justice, the inflexible judge condemned both, when they were\r\nexecuted accordingly, being first beheaded, and their bodies afterward\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\nSecundianus, having been accused as a christian, was conveyed to prison\r\nby some soldiers. On the way, Verianus and Marcellinus said, \"Where are\r\nyou carrying the innocent?\" This interrogatory occasioned them to be\r\nseized, and all three, after having been tortured, were hanged and\r\ndecapitated.\r\n\r\nOrigen, the celebrated presbyter and catechist of Alexandria, at the age\r\nof sixty-four, was seized, thrown into a loathsome prison, laden with\r\nfetters, his feet placed in the stocks, and his legs extended to the\r\nutmost for several successive days. He was threatened with fire, and\r\ntormented by every lingering means the most infernal imaginations could\r\nsuggest. During thus cruel temporizing, the emperor Decius died, and\r\nGallus, who succeeded him, engaging in a war with the Goths, the\r\nchristians met with a respite. In this interim, Origen obtained his\r\nenlargement, and, retiring to Tyre, he there remained till his death,\r\nwhich happened when he was in the sixty-ninth year of his age.\r\n\r\nGallus, the emperor, having concluded his wars, a plague broke out in\r\nthe empire: sacrifices to the pagan deities were ordered by the emperor,\r\nand persecutions spread from the interior to the extreme parts of the\r\nempire, and many fell martyrs to the impetuosity of the rabble, as well\r\nas the prejudice of the magistrates. Among these were Cornelius, the\r\nchristian bishop of Rome, and Lucius, his successor, in 253.\r\n\r\nMost of the errors which crept into the church at this time, arose from\r\nplacing human reason in competition with revelation; but the fallacy of\r\nsuch arguments being proved by the most able divines, the opinions they\r\nhad created vanished away like the stars before the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Eighth Persecution, under Valerian, A. D. 257_,\r\n\r\nBegan under Valerian, in the month of April, 257, and continued for\r\nthree years and six months. The martyrs that fell in this persecution\r\nwere innumerable, and their tortures and deaths as various and painful.\r\nThe most eminent martyrs were the following, though neither rank, sex,\r\nor age were regarded.\r\n\r\nRufina and Secunda, two beautiful and accomplished ladies, daughters of\r\nAsterius, a gentleman of eminence in Rome. Rufina, the elder, was\r\ndesigned in marriage for Armentarius, a young nobleman; Secunda, the\r\nyounger, for Verinus a person of rank and opulence. The suitors, at the\r\ntime of the persecution's commencing, were both christians; but when\r\ndanger appeared, to save their fortunes, they renounced their faith.\r\nThey took great pains to persuade the ladies to do the same, but,\r\ndisappointed in their purpose, the lovers were base enough to inform\r\nagainst the ladies, who, being apprehended as christians, were brought\r\nbefore Junius Donatus, governor of Rome, where, A. D. 257, they sealed\r\ntheir martyrdom with their blood.\r\n\r\nStephen, bishop of Rome, was beheaded in the same year, and about that\r\ntime Saturnius, the pious orthodox bishop of Thoulouse, refusing to\r\nsacrifice to idols, was treated with all the barbarous indignities\r\nimaginable, and fastened by the feet to the tail of a bull. Upon a\r\nsignal given, the enraged animal was driven down the steps of the\r\ntemple, by which the worthy martyr's brains were dashed out.\r\n\r\nSextus succeeded Stephen as bishop of Rome. He is supposed to have been\r\na Greek by birth or by extraction, and had for some time served in the\r\ncapacity of a deacon under Stephen. His great fidelity, singular wisdom,\r\nand uncommon courage, distinguished him upon many occasions; and the\r\nhappy conclusion of a controversy with some heretics is generally\r\nascribed to his piety and prudence. In the year 258, Marcianus, who had\r\nthe management of the Roman government, procured an order from the\r\nemperor Valerian, to put to death all the christian clergy in Rome, and\r\nhence the bishop with six of his deacons, suffered martyrdom in 258.\r\n\r\nLaurentius, generally called St. Laurence, the principal of the deacons,\r\nwho taught and preached under Sextus, followed him to the place of\r\nexecution; when Sextus predicted, that he should, three days after, meet\r\nhim in heaven.\r\n\r\nLaurentius, looking upon this as a certain indication of his own\r\napproaching martyrdom, at his return gathered together all the christian\r\npoor, and distributed the treasures of the church, which had been\r\ncommitted to his care, among them.\r\n\r\nThis liberality alarmed the persecutors, who commanded him to give an\r\nimmediate account to the emperor of the church treasures. This he\r\npromised to do in three days, during which interval, he collected\r\ntogether a great number of aged, helpless, and impotent poor; he\r\nrepaired to the magistrate, and presenting them to him, said, \"These are\r\nthe true treasures of the church.\" Incensed at the disappointment, and\r\nfancying the matter meant in ridicule, the governor ordered him to be\r\nimmediately scourged. He was then beaten with iron rods, set upon a\r\nwooden horse, and had his limbs dislocated. These tortures he endured\r\nwith fortitude and perseverance; when he was ordered to be fastened to a\r\nlarge gridiron, with a slow fire under it, that his death might be the\r\nmore lingering. His astonishing constancy during these trials, and\r\nserenity of countenance while under such excruciating torments, gave the\r\nspectators so exalted an idea of the dignity and truth of the christian\r\nreligion, that many became converts upon the occasion, of whom was\r\nRomanus, a soldier.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the persecution raged with peculiar violence; many thousands\r\nreceived the crown of martyrdom, among whom the following were the most\r\ndistinguished characters:\r\n\r\nCyprian, bishop of Carthage, an eminent prelate, and a pious ornament of\r\nthe church. The brightness of his genius was tempered by the solidity of\r\nhis judgment; and with all the accomplishments of the gentleman, he\r\nblended the virtues of a christian. His doctrines were orthodox and\r\npure; his language easy and elegant; and his manners graceful and\r\nwinning: in fine, he was both the pious and polite preacher. In his\r\nyouth he was educated in the principles of Gentilism, and having a\r\nconsiderable fortune, he lived in the very extravagance of splendour,\r\nand all the dignity of pomp.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 246, Coecilius, a christian minister of Carthage became\r\nthe happy instrument of Cyprian's conversion: on which account, and for\r\nthe great love that he always afterward bore for the author of his\r\nconversion, he was termed Coecilius Cyprian. Previous to his baptism,\r\nhe studied the scriptures with care, and being struck with the beauties\r\nof the truths they contained, he determined to practise the virtues\r\ntherein recommended. Subsequent to his baptism, he sold his estate,\r\ndistributed the money among the poor, dressed himself in plain attire,\r\nand commenced a life of austerity. He was soon after made a presbyter;\r\nand, being greatly admired for his virtues and works, on the death of\r\nDonatus, in A. D. 248, he was almost unanimously elected bishop of\r\nCarthage.\r\n\r\nCyprian's care not only extended over Carthage, but to Numidia and\r\nMauritania. In all his transactions he took great care to ask the advice\r\nof his clergy, knowing, that unanimity alone could be of service to the\r\nchurch, this being one of his maxims, \"That the bishop was in the\r\nchurch, and the church in the bishop; so that unity can only be\r\npreserved by a close connexion between the pastor and his flock.\"\r\n\r\nA. D. 250, Cyprian was publicly proscribed by the emperor Decius, under\r\nthe appellation of Coecilius Cyprian, bishop of the christians; and\r\nthe universal cry of the pagans was, \"Cyprian to the lions, Cyprian to\r\nthe beasts.\" The bishop, however, withdrew from the rage of the\r\npopulace, and his effects were immediately confiscated. During his\r\nretirement, he wrote thirty pious and elegant letters to his flock; but\r\nseveral schisms that then crept into the church, gave him great\r\nuneasiness. The rigour of the persecution abating, he returned to\r\nCarthage, and did every thing in his power to expunge erroneous\r\nopinions. A terrible plague breaking out in Carthage, it was as usual,\r\nlaid to the charge of the christians; and the magistrates began to\r\npersecute accordingly, which occasioned an epistle from them to Cyprian,\r\nin answer to which he vindicates the cause of christianity. A. D. 257,\r\nCyprian was brought before the proconsul Aspasius Paturnus, who exiled\r\nhim to a little city on the Lybian sea. On the death of this proconsul,\r\nhe returned to Carthage, but was soon after seized, and carried before\r\nthe now governor, who condemned him to be beheaded; which sentence was\r\nexecuted on the 14th of September, A. D. 258.\r\n\r\nThe disciples of Cyprian, martyred in this persecution, were Lucius,\r\nFlavian, Victoricus, Remus, Montanus, Julian, Primelus, and Donatian.\r\n\r\nAt Utica, a most terrible tragedy was exhibited: 300 christians were, by\r\nthe orders of the proconsul, placed round a burning limekiln. A pan of\r\ncoals and incense being prepared, they were commanded either to\r\nsacrifice to Jupiter, or to be thrown into the kiln. Unanimously\r\nrefusing, they bravely jumped into the pit, and were immediately\r\nsuffocated.\r\n\r\nFructuosus, bishop of Tarragon, in Spain, and his two deacons, Augurius\r\nand Eulogius, were burnt for being christians.\r\n\r\nAlexander, Malchus, and Priscus, three christians of Palestine, with a\r\nwoman of the same place, voluntarily accused themselves of being\r\nchristians; on which account they were sentenced to be devoured by\r\ntigers, which sentence was executed accordingly.\r\n\r\nMaxima, Donatilla, and Secunda, three virgins of Tuburga, had gall and\r\nvinegar given them to drink, were then severely scourged, tormented on a\r\ngibbet, rubbed with lime, scorched on a gridiron, worried by wild\r\nbeasts, and at length beheaded.\r\n\r\nIt is here proper to take notice of the singular but miserable fate of\r\nthe emperor Valerian, who had so long and so terribly persecuted the\r\nchristians.\r\n\r\nThis tyrant, by a stratagem, was taken prisoner by Sapor, emperor of\r\nPersia, who carried him into his own country, and there treated him with\r\nthe most unexampled indignity, making him kneel down as the meanest\r\nslave, and treading upon him as a footstool when he mounted his horse.\r\n\r\nAfter having kept him for the space of seven years in this abject state\r\nof slavery, he caused his eyes to be put out, though he was then 83\r\nyears of age. This not satiating his desire of revenge, he soon after\r\nordered his body to be flayed alive, and rubbed with salt, under which\r\ntorments he expired; and thus fell one of the most tyrannical emperors\r\nof Rome, and one of the greatest persecutors of the christians.\r\n\r\nA. D. 260, Gallienus, the son of Valerian, succeeded him, and during his\r\nreign (a few martyrs excepted) the church enjoyed peace for some years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ninth Persecution under Aurelian, A. D. 274._\r\n\r\nThe principal sufferers were, Felix, bishop of Rome. This prelate was\r\nadvanced to the Roman see in 274. He was the first martyr to Aurelian's\r\npetulancy, being beheaded on the 22d of December, in the same year.\r\n\r\nAgapetus, a young gentleman, who sold his estate, and gave the money to\r\nthe poor, was seized as a christian, tortured, and then beheaded at\r\nPraeneste, a city within a day's journey of Rome.\r\n\r\nThese are the only martyrs left upon record during this reign, as it was\r\nsoon put a stop to by the emperor's being murdered by his own domestics,\r\nat Byzantium.\r\n\r\nAurelian was succeeded by Tacitus, who was followed by Probus, as the\r\nlatter was by Carus: this emperor being killed by a thunder storm, his\r\nsons, Carnious and Numerian, succeeded him, and during all these reigns\r\nthe church had peace.\r\n\r\nDiocletian mounted the imperial throne, A. D. 284; at first he showed\r\ngreat favour to the christians. In the year 286, he associated Maximian\r\nwith him in the empire; and some christians were put to death before any\r\ngeneral persecution broke out. Among these were Felician and Primus, two\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nMarcus and Marcellianus were twins, natives of Rome, and of noble\r\ndescent. Their parents were heathens, but the tutors, to whom the\r\neducation of the children was intrusted, brought them up as christians.\r\n\r\nTheir constancy at length subdued those who wished them to become\r\npagans, and their parents and whole family became converts to a faith\r\nthey had before reprobated. They were martyred by being tied to posts,\r\nand having their feet pierced with nails. After remaining in this\r\nsituation for a day and a night, their sufferings were put an end to by\r\nthrusting lances through their bodies.\r\n\r\nZoe, the wife of the jailer, who had the care of the before-mentioned\r\nmartyrs, was also converted by them, and hung upon a tree, with a fire\r\nof straw lighted under her. When her body was taken down, it was thrown\r\ninto a river, with a large stone tied to it, in order to sink it.\r\n\r\nIn the year of Christ 286, a most remarkable affair occurred; a legion\r\nof soldiers, consisting of 6666 men, contained none but christians. This\r\nlegion was called the Theban Legion, because the men had been raised in\r\nThebias: they were quartered in the east till the emperor Maximian\r\nordered them to march to Gaul, to assist him against the rebels of\r\nBurgundy. They passed the Alps into Gaul, under the command of\r\nMauritius, Candidus, and Exupernis, their worthy commanders, and at\r\nlength joined the emperor.\r\n\r\nMaximian, about this time, ordered a general sacrifice, at which the\r\nwhole army was to assist; and likewise he commanded, that they should\r\ntake the oath of allegiance and swear, at the same time, to assist in\r\nthe extirpation of christianity in Gaul.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at these orders, each individual of the Theban Legion absolutely\r\nrefused either to sacrifice or take the oaths prescribed. This so\r\ngreatly enraged Maximian, that he ordered the legion to be decimated,\r\nthat is, every tenth man to be selected from the rest, and put to the\r\nsword. This bloody order having been put in execution, those who\r\nremained alive were still inflexible, when a second decimation took\r\nplace, and every tenth man of those living were put to death.\r\n\r\nThis second severity made no more impression than the first had done;\r\nthe soldiers preserved their fortitude and their principles, but by the\r\nadvice of their officers they drew up a loyal remonstrance to the\r\nemperor. This, it might have been presumed, would have softened the\r\nemperor, but it had a contrary effect: for, enraged at their\r\nperseverance and unanimity, he commanded, that the whole legion should\r\nbe put to death, which was accordingly executed by the other troops, who\r\ncut them to pieces with their swords, 22d Sept. 286.\r\n\r\nAlban, from whom St. Alban's, in Hertfordshire, received its name, was\r\nthe first British martyr. Great Britain had received the gospel of\r\nChrist from Lucius, the first christian king, but did not suffer from\r\nthe rage of persecution for many years after. He was originally a pagan,\r\nbut converted by a christian ecclesiastic, named Amphibalus, whom he\r\nsheltered on account of his religion. The enemies of Amphibalus, having\r\nintelligence of the place where he was secreted, came to the house of\r\nAlban; in order to facilitate his escape, when the soldiers came, he\r\noffered himself up as the person they were seeking for. The deceit being\r\ndetected, the governor ordered him to be scourged, and then he was\r\nsentenced to be beheaded, June 22, A. D. 287.\r\n\r\nThe venerable Bede assures us, that, upon this occasion, the executioner\r\nsuddenly became a convert to christianity, and entreated permission to\r\ndie for Alban, or with him. Obtaining the latter request, they were\r\nbeheaded by a soldier, who voluntarily undertook the task of\r\nexecutioner. This happened on the 22d of June, A. D. 287, at Verulam,\r\nnow St. Albans, in Hertfordshire, where a magnificent church was erected\r\nto his memory about the time of Constantine the Great. This edifice,\r\nbeing destroyed in the Saxon wars, was rebuilt by Offa, king of Mercia,\r\nand a monastery erected adjoining to it, some remains of which are still\r\nvisible, and the church is a noble Gothic structure.\r\n\r\nFaith, a christian female, of Acquitain, in France, was ordered to be\r\nbroiled upon a gridiron, and then beheaded; A. D. 287.\r\n\r\nQuintin was a christian, and a native of Rome, but determined to attempt\r\nthe propagation of the gospel in Gaul, with one Lucian, they preached\r\ntogether in Amiens; after which Lucian went to Beaumaris, where he was\r\nmartyred. Quintin remained in Picardy, and was very zealous in his\r\nministry.\r\n\r\nBeing seized upon as a christian, he was stretched with pullies till his\r\njoints were dislocated: his body was then torn with wire scourges, and\r\nboiling oil and pitch poured on his naked flesh; lighted torches were\r\napplied to his sides and armpits; and after he had been thus tortured,\r\nhe was remanded back to prison, and died of the barbarities he had\r\nsuffered, October 31, A. D. 287. His body was sunk in the Somme.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tenth Persecution under Diocletian, A. D. 303_,\r\n\r\nUnder the Roman Emperors, commonly called the Era of the Martyrs, was\r\noccasioned partly by the increasing numbers and luxury of the\r\nchristians, and the hatred of Galerius, the adopted son of Diocletian,\r\nwho, being stimulated by his mother, a bigoted pagan, never ceased\r\npersuading the emperor to enter upon the persecution, till he had\r\naccomplished his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe fatal day fixed upon to commence the bloody work, was the 23d of\r\nFebruary, A. D. 303, that being the day in which the Terminalia were\r\ncelebrated, and on which, as the cruel pagans boasted, they hoped to put\r\na termination to christianity. On the appointed day, the persecution\r\nbegan in Nicomedia, on the morning of which the prefect of that city\r\nrepaired, with a great number of officers and assistants, to the church\r\nof the christians, where, having forced open the doors, they seized upon\r\nall the sacred books, and committed them to the flames.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this transaction was in the presence of Diocletian and\r\nGalerius, who, not contented with burning the books, had the church\r\nlevelled with the ground. This was followed by a severe edict,\r\ncommanding the destruction of all other christian churches and books;\r\nand an order soon succeeded, to render christians of all denominations\r\noutlaws.\r\n\r\nThe publication of this edict occasioned an immediate martyrdom for a\r\nbold christian not only tore it down from the place to which it was\r\naffixed, but execrated the name of the emperor for his injustice.\r\n\r\nA provocation like this was sufficient to call down pagan vengeance upon\r\nhis head; he was accordingly seized, severely tortured, and then burned\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nAll the christians were apprehended and imprisoned; and Galerius\r\nprivately ordered the imperial palace to be set on fire, that the\r\nchristians might be charged as the incendiaries, and a plausible\r\npretence given for carrying on the persecution with the greatest\r\nseverities. A general sacrifice was commenced, which occasioned various\r\nmartyrdoms. No distinction was made of age or sex; the name of Christian\r\nwas so obnoxious to the pagans, that all indiscriminately fell\r\nsacrifices to their opinions. Many houses were set on fire, and whole\r\nchristian families perished in the flames; and others had stones\r\nfastened about their necks, and being tied together were driven into the\r\nsea. The persecution became general in all the Roman provinces, but more\r\nparticularly in the east; and as it lasted ten years, it is impossible\r\nto ascertain the numbers martyred, or to enumerate the various modes of\r\nmartyrdom.\r\n\r\nRacks, scourges, swords, daggers, crosses, poison, and famine, were made\r\nuse of in various parts to despatch the christians; and invention was\r\nexhausted to devise tortures against such as had no crime, but thinking\r\ndifferently from the votaries of superstition.\r\n\r\nA city of Phrygia, consisting entirely of christians, was burnt, and all\r\nthe inhabitants perished in the flames.\r\n\r\nTired with slaughter, at length, several governors of provinces\r\nrepresented to the imperial court, the impropriety of such conduct.\r\nHence many were respited from execution, but, though they were not put\r\nto death, as much as possible was done to render their lives miserable,\r\nmany of them having their ears cut off, their noses slit, their right\r\neyes put out, their limbs rendered useless by dreadful dislocations, and\r\ntheir flesh seared in conspicuous places with red-hot irons.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary now to particularize the most conspicuous persons who\r\nlaid down their lives in martyrdom in this bloody persecution.\r\n\r\nSebastian, a celebrated martyr, was born at Narbonne, in Gaul,\r\ninstructed in the principles of christianity at Milan, and afterward\r\nbecame an officer of the emperor's guard at Rome. He remained a true\r\nchristian in the midst of idolatry; unallured by the splendours of a\r\ncourt, untainted by evil examples, and uncontaminated by the hopes of\r\npreferment. Refusing to be a pagan, the emperor ordered him to be taken\r\nto a field near the city, termed the Campus Martius, and there to be\r\nshot to death with arrows; which sentence was executed accordingly. Some\r\npious christians coming to the place of execution, in order to give his\r\nbody burial, perceived signs of life in him, and immediately moving him\r\nto a place of security, they, in a short time effected his recovery, and\r\nprepared him for a second martyrdom; for, as soon as he was able to go\r\nout, he placed himself intentionally in the emperor's way as he was\r\ngoing to the temple, and reprehended him for his various cruelties and\r\nunreasonable prejudices against christianity. As soon as Diocletian had\r\novercome his surprise, he ordered Sebastian to be seized, and carried to\r\na place near the palace, and beaten to death; and, that the christians\r\nshould not either use means again to recover or bury his body, he\r\nordered that it should be thrown into the common sewer. Nevertheless, a\r\nchristian lady, named Lucina, found means to remove it from the sewer,\r\nand bury it in the catacombs, or repositories of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe christians, about this time, upon mature consideration, thought it\r\nunlawful to bear arms under a heathen emperor. Maximilian, the son of\r\nFabius Victor, was the first beheaded under this regulation.\r\n\r\nVitus, a Sicilian of considerable family, was brought up a christian;\r\nwhen his virtues increased with his years, his constancy supported him\r\nunder all afflictions, and his faith was superior to the most dangerous\r\nperils. His father, Hylas, who was a pagan, finding that he had been\r\ninstructed in the principles of christianity by the nurse who brought\r\nhim up, used all his endeavours to bring him back to paganism and at\r\nlength sacrificed his son to the idols, June 14, A. D. 303.\r\n\r\nVictor was a Christian of a good family at Marseilles, in France; he\r\nspent a great part of the night in visiting the afflicted, and\r\nconfirming the weak; which pious work he could not, consistently with\r\nhis own safety, perform in the daytime; and his fortune he spent in\r\nrelieving the distresses of poor christians.\r\n\r\nHe was at length, however, seized by the emperor's Maximian's decree,\r\nwho ordered him to be bound, and dragged through the streets. During the\r\nexecution of this order, he was treated with all manner of cruelties and\r\nindignities by the enraged populace. Remaining still inflexible, his\r\ncourage was deemed obstinacy.\r\n\r\nBeing by order stretched upon the rack, he turned his eyes towards\r\nheaven, and prayed to God to endue him with patience, after which he\r\nunderwent the tortures with most admirable fortitude. After the\r\nexecutioners were tired with inflicting torments on him, he was conveyed\r\nto a dungeon. In his confinement, he converted his jailers, named\r\nAlexander, Felician, and Longinus. This affair coming to the ears of the\r\nemperor, he ordered them immediately to be put to death, and the jailers\r\nwere accordingly beheaded. Victor was then again put to the rack,\r\nunmercifully beaten with batons, and again sent to prison.\r\n\r\nBeing a third time examined concerning his religion, he persevered in\r\nhis principles; a small altar was then brought, and he was commanded to\r\noffer incense upon it immediately. Fired with indignation at the\r\nrequest, he boldly stepped forward, and with his foot overthrew both\r\naltar and idol. This so enraged the emperor Maximian, who was present,\r\nthat he ordered the foot with which he had kicked the altar to be\r\nimmediately cut off; and Victor was thrown into a mill, and crushed to\r\npieces with the stones, A. D. 303.\r\n\r\nMaximus, governor of Cilicia, being at Tarsus, three christians were\r\nbrought before him; their names were Tarachus, an aged man; Probus, and\r\nAndronicus. After repeated tortures and exhortations to recant, they, at\r\nlength, were ordered for execution.\r\n\r\nBeing brought to the amphitheatre, several beasts were let loose upon\r\nthem; but none of the animals, though hungry, would touch them. The\r\nkeeper then brought out a large bear, that had that very day destroyed\r\nthree men; but this voracious creature and a fierce lioness both refused\r\nto touch the prisoners. Finding the design of destroying them by the\r\nmeans of wild beasts ineffectual, Maximus ordered them to be slain by\r\nthe sword, on the 11th of October, A. D. 303.\r\n\r\nRomanus, a native of Palestine, was deacon of the church of Caesarea, at\r\nthe time of the commencement of Diocletian's persecution. Being\r\ncondemned for his faith at Antioch, he was scourged, put to the rack,\r\nhis body torn with hooks, his flesh cut with knives, his face scarified,\r\nhis teeth beaten from their sockets, and his hair plucked up by the\r\nroots. Soon after he was ordered to be strangled, Nov. 17, A. D. 303.\r\n\r\nSusanna, the niece of Caius, bishop of Rome, was pressed by the emperor\r\nDiocletian to marry a noble pagan, who was nearly related to him.\r\nRefusing the honour intended her, she was beheaded by the emperor's\r\norder.\r\n\r\nDorotheus, the high chamberlain of the household to Diocletian, was a\r\nchristian, and took great pains to make converts. In his religious\r\nlabours, he was joined by Gorgonius, another christian, and one\r\nbelonging to the palace. They were first tortured and then strangled.\r\n\r\nPeter, a eunuch belonging to the emperor, was a christian of singular\r\nmodesty and humility. He was laid on a gridiron, and broiled over a slow\r\nfire till he expired.\r\n\r\nCyprian, known by the title of the magician, to distinguish him from\r\nCyprian, bishop of Carthage, was a native of Antioch. He received a\r\nliberal education in his youth, and particularly applied himself to\r\nastrology; after which he travelled for improvement through Greece,\r\nEgypt, India, &c. In the course of time he became acquainted with\r\nJustina, a young lady of Antioch, whose birth, beauty, and\r\naccomplishments, rendered her the admiration of all who knew her.\r\n\r\nA pagan gentleman applied to Cyprian, to promote his suit with the\r\nbeautiful Justina; this he undertook, but soon himself became converted,\r\nburnt his books of astrology and magic, received baptism, and felt\r\nanimated with a powerful spirit of grace. The conversion of Cyprian had\r\na great effect on the pagan gentleman who paid his addresses to Justina,\r\nand he in a short time embraced christianity. During the persecution of\r\nDiocletian, Cyprian and Justina were seized upon as christians, when the\r\nformer was torn with pincers, and the later chastised and, after\r\nsuffering other torments, were beheaded.\r\n\r\nEulalia, a Spanish lady of a christian family, was remarkable in her\r\nyouth for sweetness of temper, and solidity of understanding seldom\r\nfound in the capriciousness of juvenile years. Being apprehended as a\r\nchristian, the magistrate attempted by the mildest means, to bring her\r\nover to paganism, but she ridiculed the pagan deities with such\r\nasperity, that the judge, incensed at her behaviour, ordered her to be\r\ntortured. Her sides were accordingly torn by hooks, and her breasts\r\nburnt in the most shocking manner, till she expired by the violence of\r\nthe flames, Dec. A. D. 303.\r\n\r\nIn the year 304, when the persecution reached Spain, Dacian, the\r\ngovernor of Terragona ordered Valerius the bishop, and Vincent the\r\ndeacon, to be seized, loaded with irons, and imprisoned. The prisoners\r\nbeing firm in their resolution, Valerius was banished, and Vincent was\r\nracked, and his limbs dislocated, his flesh torn with hooks, and was\r\nlaid on a gridiron, which had not only a fire placed under it, but\r\nspikes at the top, which ran into his flesh. These torments neither\r\ndestroying him, nor changing his resolutions, he was remanded to prison,\r\nand confined in a small, loathsome, dark dungeon, strewed with sharp\r\nflints, and pieces of broken glass, where he died, Jan. 22, 304.--His\r\nbody was thrown into the river.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of Diocletian began particularly to rage in A. D. 304,\r\nwhen many christians were put to cruel tortures, and the most painful\r\nand ignominious deaths; the most eminent and particular of whom we shall\r\nenumerate.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, a priest of Albitina, a town of Africa, after being\r\ntortured, was remanded to prison, and there starved to death. His four\r\nchildren, after being variously tormented, shared the same fate with\r\ntheir father.\r\n\r\nDativas, a noble Roman senator; Thelico, a pious Christian, Victoria, a\r\nyoung lady of considerable family and fortune, with some others of less\r\nconsideration, all auditors of Saturninus, were tortured in a similar\r\nmanner, and perished by the same means.\r\n\r\nAgrape, Chioma, and Irene, three sisters, were seized upon at\r\nThessalonica, when Diocletian's persecution reached Greece. They were\r\nburnt, and received the crown of martyrdom in the flames, March 25, A.\r\nD. 304. The governor, finding that he could make no impression on Irene,\r\nordered her to be exposed naked in the streets, which shameful order\r\nhaving been executed, she was burnt, April 1, A. D. 304, at the same\r\nplace where her sisters suffered.\r\n\r\nAgatho, a man of a pious turn of mind, with Cassice, Phillippa, and\r\nEutychia, were martyred about the same time; but the particulars have\r\nnot been transmitted to us.\r\n\r\nMarcellinus, bishop of Rome, who succeeded Caius in that see, having\r\nstrongly opposed paying divine honours to Diocletian, suffered\r\nmartyrdom, by a variety of tortures, in the year 321, comforting his\r\nsoul till he expired with the prospect of those glorious rewards it\r\nwould receive by the tortures suffered in the body.\r\n\r\nVictorius, Carpophorus, Severus, and Severianus, were brothers, and all\r\nfour employed in places of great trust and honour in the city of Rome.\r\nHaving exclaimed against the worship of idols, they were apprehended,\r\nand scourged, with the plumbetae, or scourges, to the ends of which were\r\nfastened leaden balls. This punishment was exercised with such excess of\r\ncruelty, that the pious brothers fell martyrs to its severity.\r\n\r\nTimothy, a deacon of Mauritania, and Maura his wife, had not been united\r\ntogether by the bands of wedlock above three weeks, when they were\r\nseparated from each other by the persecution.--Timothy, being\r\napprehended as a christian, was carried before Arrianus, the governor of\r\nThebais, who, knowing that he had the keeping of the Holy Scriptures,\r\ncommanded him to deliver them up to be burnt; to which he answered, \"Had\r\nI children, I would sooner deliver them up to be sacrificed, than part\r\nwith the word of God.\" The governor being much incensed at this reply,\r\nordered his eyes to be put out with red-hot irons, saying \"The books\r\nshall at least be useless to you, for you shall not see to read them.\"\r\nHis patience under the operation was so great, that the governor grew\r\nmore exasperated; he, therefore, in order, if possible, to overcome his\r\nfortitude, ordered him to be hung up by the feet, with a weight tied\r\nabout his neck, and a gag in his mouth. In this state, Maura, his wife,\r\ntenderly urged him for her sake to recant; but, when the gag was taken\r\nout of his mouth, instead of consenting to his wife's entreaties, he\r\ngreatly blamed her mistaken love, and declared his resolution of dying\r\nfor the faith. The consequence was, that Maura resolved to imitate his\r\ncourage and fidelity and either to accompany or follow him to glory. The\r\ngovernor, after trying in vain to alter her resolution, ordered her to\r\nbe tortured which was executed with great severity. After this, Timothy\r\nand Maura were crucified near each other, A. D. 304.\r\n\r\nSabinus, bishop of Assisium, refusing to sacrifice to Jupiter, and\r\npushing the idol from him, had his hand cut off by the order of the\r\ngovernor of Tuscany. While in prison, he converted the governor and his\r\nfamily, all of whom suffered martyrdom for the faith. Soon after their\r\nexecution, Sabinus himself was scourged to death. Dec.. A. D. 304.\r\n\r\nTired with the farce of state and public business, the emperor\r\nDiocletian resigned the imperial diadem, and was succeeded by\r\nConstantius and Galerius; the former a prince of the most mild and\r\nhumane disposition and the latter equally remarkable for his cruelty and\r\ntyranny. These divided the empire into two equal governments, Galerius\r\nruling in the east, and Constantius in the west; and the people in the\r\ntwo governments felt the effects of the dispositions of the two\r\nemperors; for those in the west were governed in the mildest manner, but\r\nsuch as resided in the east, felt all then miseries of oppression and\r\nlengthened tortures.\r\n\r\nAmong the many martyred by the order of Galerius, we shall enumerate the\r\nmost eminent.\r\n\r\nAmphianus was a gentleman of eminence in Lucia, and a scholar of\r\nEusebius; Julitta, a Lycaonian of royal descent, but more celebrated for\r\nher virtues than noble blood. While on the rack, her child was killed\r\nbefore her face. Julitta, of Cappadocia, was a lady of distinguished\r\ncapacity, great virtue, and uncommon courage.--To complete the\r\nexecution, Julitta had boiling pitch poured on her feet, her sides torn\r\nwith hooks, and received the conclusion of her martyrdom, by being\r\nbeheaded, April 16, A. D. 305.\r\n\r\nHermolaus, a venerable and pious christian, of a great age, and an\r\nintimate acquaintance of Panteleon's, suffered martyrdom for the faith\r\non the same day, and in the same manner as Panteleon.\r\n\r\nEustratius, secretary to the governor of Armina, was thrown into a fiery\r\nfurnace, for exhorting some christians who had been apprehended, to\r\npersevere in their faith.\r\n\r\nNicander and Marcian, two eminent Roman military officers, were\r\napprehended on account of their faith. As they were both men of great\r\nabilities in their profession, the utmost means were used to induce them\r\nto renounce christianity: but these endeavours being found ineffectual,\r\nthey were beheaded.\r\n\r\nIn the kingdom of Naples, several martyrdoms took place, in particular,\r\nJanuaries, bishop of Beneventum; Sosius, deacon of Misene Proculus,\r\nanother deacon; Eutyches and Acutius, two laymen: Festus, a deacon; and\r\nDesiderius, a reader; were all, on account of being christians,\r\ncondemned by the governor of Campania, to be devoured by the wild\r\nbeasts. The savage animals, however, not touching them, they were\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\nQuirinus, bishop of Siscia, being carried before Matenius, the governor,\r\nwas ordered to sacrifice to the pagan deities, agreeably to the edicts\r\nof various Roman emperors. The governor, perceiving his constancy, sent\r\nhim to jail, and ordered him to be heavily ironed; flattering himself,\r\nthat the hardships of a jail, some occasional tortures and the weight\r\nof chains, might overcome his resolution. Being decided in his\r\nprinciples, he was sent to Amantius, the principal governor of Pannonia,\r\nnow Hungary, who loaded him with chains, and carried him through the\r\nprincipal towns of the Danube, exposing him to ridicule wherever he\r\nwent. Arriving at length at Sabaria, and finding that Quirinus would not\r\nrenounce his faith, he ordered him to be cast into a river, with a stone\r\nfastened about his neck. This sentence being put into execution,\r\nQuirinus floated about for some time, and, exhorting the people in the\r\nmost pious terms, concluded his admonitions with this prayer: \"It is no\r\nnew thing, O all-powerful Jesus, for thee to stop the course of rivers,\r\nor to cause a man to walk upon the water as thou didst thy servant\r\nPeter; the people have already seen the proof of thy power in me; grant\r\nme now to lay down my life for thy sake, O my God.\" On pronouncing the\r\nlast words he immediately sank, and died, June 4, A. D. 308; his body\r\nwas afterwards taken up, and buried by some pious christians.\r\n\r\nPamphilus, a native of Phoenicia, of a considerable family, was a man\r\nof such extensive learning, that he was called a second Origen. He was\r\nreceived into the body of the clergy at Caesarea, where he established a\r\npublic library and spent his time in the practice of every christian\r\nvirtue. He copied the greatest part of the works of Origen with his own\r\nhand, and, assisted by Eusebius, gave a correct copy of the Old\r\nTestament, which had suffered greatly by the ignorance or negligence of\r\nfirmer transcribers. In the year 307, he was apprehended, and suffered\r\ntorture and martyrdom.\r\n\r\nMarcellus, bishop of Rome, being banished on account of his faith, fell\r\na martyr to the miseries he suffered in exile, 16th Jan. A. D. 310.\r\n\r\nPeter, the sixteenth bishop of Alexandria, was martyred Nov. 25, A. D.\r\n311, by order of Maximus Caesar, who reigned in the east.\r\n\r\nAgnes, a virgin of only thirteen years of age, was beheaded for being a\r\nchristian; as was Serene, the empress of Diocletian. Valentine, a\r\npriest, suffered the same fate at Rome; and Erasmus, a bishop, was\r\nmartyred in Campania.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the persecution abated in the middle parts of the\r\nempire, as well as in the west; and Providence at length began to\r\nmanifest vengeance on the persecutors. Maximian endeavoured to corrupt\r\nhis daughter Fausta to murder Constantine her husband; which she\r\ndiscovered, and Constantine forced him to choose his own death, when he\r\npreferred the ignominious death of hanging, after being an emperor near\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nGalerius was visited by an incurable and intolerable disease, which\r\nbegan with an ulcer in his secret parts and a fistula in ano, that\r\nspread progressively to his inmost bowels, and baffled all the skill of\r\nphysicians and surgeons. Untried medicines of some daring professors\r\ndrove the evil through his bones to the very marrow, and worms began to\r\nbreed in his entrails; and the stench was so preponderant as to be\r\nperceived in the city; all the passages separating the passages of the\r\nurine, and excrements being corroded and destroyed. The whole mass of\r\nhis body was turned unto universal rottenness; and, though living\r\ncreatures, and boiled animals, were applied with the design of drawing\r\nout the vermin by the heat, by which a vast hive was opened, a second\r\nimposthume discovered a more prodigious swarm, as if his whole body was\r\nresolved into worms. By a dropsy also his body was grossly disfigured;\r\nfor although his upper parts were exhausted, and dried to a skeleton,\r\ncovered only with dead skin; the lower parts were swelled up like\r\nbladders, and the shape of his feet could scarcely be perceived.\r\nTorments and pains insupportable, greater than those he had inflicted\r\nupon the christians, accompanied these visitations, and he bellowed out\r\nlike a wounded bull, often endeavouring to kill himself and destroying\r\nseveral physicians for the inefficacy of their medicines. These torments\r\nkept him in a languishing state a full year, and his conscience was\r\nawakened, at length, so that he was compelled to acknowledge the God of\r\nthe christians, and to promise, in the intervals of his paroxysms, that\r\nhe would rebuild the churches, and repair the mischief done to them. An\r\nedict in his last agonies, was published in his name, and the joint\r\nnames of Constantine and Licinius, to permit the christians to have the\r\nfree use of religion, and to supplicate their God for his health and the\r\ngood of the empire; on which many prisoners in Nicomedia were liberated,\r\nand amongst others Donatus.\r\n\r\nAt length, Constantine the Great, determined to redress the grievances\r\nof the christians, for which purpose he raised an army of 30,000 foot,\r\nand 8000 horse, which he marched towards Rome against Maxentius, the\r\nemperor; defeated him, and entered the city of Rome in triumph. A law\r\nwas now published in favour of the christians, in which Licinius was\r\njoined by Constantine, and a copy of it was sent to Maximus in the east.\r\nMaximus, who was a bigoted pagan, greatly disliked the edict, but being\r\nafraid of Constantine, did not openly avow his disapprobation. Maximus\r\nat length invaded the territories of Licinius, but, being defeated, put\r\nan end to his life by poison. Licinius afterwards persecuting the\r\nchristians, Constantine the Great marched against him, and defeated him:\r\nhe was afterwards slain by his own soldiers.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude our account of the tenth and last general persecution\r\nwith the death of St. George, the titular saint and patron of England.\r\nSt. George was born in Cappadocia, of christian parents; and giving\r\nproofs of his courage, was promoted in the army of the emperor\r\nDiocletian. During the persecution, St. George threw up his command,\r\nwent boldly to the senate house, and avowed his being a christian,\r\ntaking occasion at the same time to remonstrate against paganism, and\r\npoint out the absurdity of worshipping idols. This freedom so greatly\r\nprovoked the senate, that St. George was ordered to be tortured, and by\r\nthe emperor's orders was dragged through the streets, and beheaded the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPERSECUTIONS OF THE CHRISTIANS IN PERSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gospel having spread itself into Persia, the pagan priests, who\r\nworshipped the sun, were greatly alarmed, and dreaded the loss of that\r\ninfluence they had hitherto maintained over the people's minds and\r\nproperties. Hence they thought it expedient to complain to the emperor,\r\nthat the christians were enemies to the state, and held a treasonable\r\ncorrespondence with the Romans, the great enemies of Persia.\r\n\r\nThe emperor Sapores, being naturally averse to christianity, easily\r\nbelieved what was said against the christians, and gave orders to\r\npersecute them in all parts of his empire. On account of this mandate,\r\nmany eminent persons in the church and state fell martyrs to the\r\nignorance and ferocity of the pagans.\r\n\r\nConstantine the Great being informed of the persecutions in Persia,\r\nwrote a long letter to the Persian monarch, in which he recounts the\r\nvengeance that had fallen on persecutors, and the great success that had\r\nattended those who had refrained from persecuting the christians. The\r\npersecution by this means ended during the life of Sapores; but it was\r\nagain renewed under the lives of his successors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecutions under the Arian Heretics._\r\n\r\nThe author of the Arian heresy was Arius, a native of Lybia, and a\r\npriest of Alexandria, who, in A. D. 318, began to publish his errors. He\r\nwas condemned by a council of Lybian and Egyptian bishops, and that\r\nsentence was confirmed by the council of Nice, A. D. 325. After the\r\ndeath of Constantine the Great, the Arians found means to ingratiate\r\nthemselves into the favour of the emperor Constantinus, his son and\r\nsuccessor in the east; and hence a persecution was raised against the\r\northodox bishops and clergy. The celebrated Athanasius, and other\r\nbishops, were banished, and their sees filled with Arians.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt and Lybia, thirty bishops were martyred, and many other\r\nchristians cruelly tormented; and, A. D. 386, George, the Arian bishop\r\nof Alexandria, under the authority of the emperor, began a persecution\r\nin that city and its environs, and carried it on with the most infernal\r\nseverity. He was assisted in his diabolical malice by Catophonius,\r\ngovernor of Egypt; Sebastian, general of the Egyptian forces; Faustinus\r\nthe treasurer; and Herachus, a Roman officer.\r\n\r\nThe persecution now raged in such a manner, that the clergy were driven\r\nfrom Alexandria, their churches were shut, and the severities practised\r\nby the Arian heretics were as great as those that had been practised by\r\nthe pagan idolaters. If a man, accused of being a christian, made his\r\nescape, then his whole family were massacred, and his effects\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecution under Julian the Apostate._\r\n\r\nThis emperor was the son of Julius Constantius, and the nephew of\r\nConstantine the Great. He studied the rudiments of grammar under the\r\ninspection of Mardomus, a eunuch, and a heathen of Constantinople. His\r\nfather sent him some time after to Nicomedia, to be instructed in the\r\nchristian religion, by the bishop of Eusebius, his kinsman, but his\r\nprinciples were corrupted by the pernicious doctrines of Ecebolius the\r\nrhetorician, and Maximus the magician.\r\n\r\nConstantius dying in the year 361, Julian succeeded him, and had no\r\nsooner attained the imperial dignity, than he renounced Christianity and\r\nembraced paganism, which had for some years fallen into great disrepute.\r\nThough he restored the idolatrous worship, he made no public edicts\r\nagainst christianity. He recalled all banished pagans, allowed the free\r\nexercise of religion to every sect, but deprived all christians of\r\noffices at court, in the magistracy, or in the army. He was chaste,\r\ntemperate, vigilant, laborious, and pious; yet he prohibited any\r\nchristian from keeping a school or public seminary of learning, and\r\ndeprived all the christian clergy of the privileges granted them by\r\nConstantine the Great.\r\n\r\nBishop Basil made himself first famous by his opposition to Arianism,\r\nwhich brought upon him the vengeance of the Arian bishop of\r\nConstantinople; he equally opposed paganism. The emperor's agents in\r\nvain tampered with Basil by means of promises, threats, and racks, he\r\nwas firm in the faith, and remained in prison to undergo some other\r\nsufferings, when the emperor came accidentally to Ancyra. Julian\r\ndetermined to examine Basil himself, when that holy man being brought\r\nbefore him, the emperor did every thing in his power to dissuade him\r\nfrom persevering in the faith. Basil not only continued as firm as ever,\r\nbut, with a prophetic spirit foretold the death of the emperor, and that\r\nhe should be tormented in the other life. Enraged at what he heard,\r\nJulian commanded that the body of Basil should be torn every day in\r\nseven different parts, till his skin and flesh were entirely mangled.\r\nThis inhuman sentence was executed with rigour, and the martyr expired\r\nunder its severities, on the 28th day of June, A. D. 362.\r\n\r\nDonatus, bishop of Arezzo, and Hilarinus, a hermit, suffered about the\r\nsame time; also Gordian, a Roman magistrate. Artemius, commander in\r\nchief of the Roman forces in Egypt, being a christian, was deprived of\r\nhis commission, then of his estate, and lastly of his head.\r\n\r\nThe persecution raged dreadfully about the latter end of the year 363;\r\nbut, as many of the particulars have not been handed down to us, it is\r\nnecessary to remark in general, that in Palestine many were burnt alive,\r\nothers were dragged by their feet through the streets naked till they\r\nexpired; some were scalded to death, many stoned, and great numbers had\r\ntheir brains beaten out with clubs. In Alexandria, innumerable were the\r\nmartyrs who suffered by the sword, burning, crucifixion, and being\r\nstoned. In Arethusa, several were ripped open, and corn being put into\r\ntheir bellies, swine were brought to feed therein, which, in devouring\r\nthe grain, likewise devoured the entrails of the martyrs, and, in\r\nThrace, Emilianus was burnt at a stake; and Domitius murdered in a cave,\r\nwhither he had fled for refuge.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, Julian the apostate, died of a wound which he received in\r\nhis Persian expedition, A. D. 363, and even while expiring, uttered the\r\nmost horrid blasphemies. He was succeeded by Jovian, who restored peace\r\nto the church.\r\n\r\nAfter the decease of Jovian, Valentinian succeeded to the empire, and\r\nassociated to himself Valens, who had the command in the east, and was\r\nan Arian, of an unrelenting and persecuting disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecution of the Christians by the Goths and Vandals._\r\n\r\nMany Scythian Goths having embraced Christianity about the time of\r\nConstantine the Great, the light of the gospel spread itself\r\nconsiderably in Scythia, though the two kings who ruled that country,\r\nand the majority of the people continued pagans. Fritegern, king of the\r\nWest Goths, was an ally to the Romans, but Athanarick, king of the East\r\nGoths, was at war with them. The christians, in the dominions of the\r\nformer, lived unmolested, but the latter, having been defeated by the\r\nRomans, wreaked his vengeance on his christian subjects, commencing his\r\npagan injunctions in the year 370.\r\n\r\nEusebius, bishop of Samosata, makes a most distinguished figure in the\r\necclesiastical history, and was one of the most eminent champions of\r\nChrist against the Arian heresy. Eusebius, after being driven from his\r\nchurch, and wandering about through Syria and Palestine, encouraging the\r\northodox, was restored with other orthodox prelates to his see, which\r\nhowever he did not long enjoy, for an Arian woman threw a tile at him\r\nfrom the top of a house, which fractured his skull, and terminated his\r\nlife in the year 380.\r\n\r\nThe Vandals passing from Spain to Africa in the fifth century, under\r\ntheir leader Genseric, committed the most unheard-of cruelties. They\r\npersecuted the christians wherever they came, and even laid waste the\r\ncountry as they passed, that the christians left behind, who had escaped\r\nthem, might not be able to subsist. Sometimes they freighted a vessel\r\nwith martyrs, let it drift out to sea, or set fire to it, with the\r\nsufferers shackled on the decks.\r\n\r\nHaving seized and plundered the city of Carthage, they put the bishop,\r\nand the clergy, into a leaky ship, and committed it to the mercy of the\r\nwaves, thinking that they must all perish of course; but providentially\r\nthe vessel arrived safe at Naples. Innumerable orthodox christians were\r\nbeaten, scourged, and banished to Capsur, where it pleased God to make\r\nthem the means of converting many of the Moors to christianity; but this\r\ncoming to the ears of Genseric, he sent orders that they and their new\r\nconverts should be tied by the feet to chariots, and dragged about until\r\nthey were dashed to pieces Pampinian, the bishop of Mansuetes, was\r\ntortured to death with plates of hot iron; the bishop of Urice was\r\nburnt, and the bishop of Habensa was banished, for refusing to deliver\r\nup the sacred books which were in his possession.\r\n\r\nThe Vandalian tyrant Genseric, having made an expedition into Italy, and\r\nplundered the city of Rome, returned to Africa, flushed with the success\r\nof his arms. The Arians took this occasion to persuade him to persecute\r\nthe orthodox christians, as they assured him that they were friends to\r\nthe people of Rome.\r\n\r\nAfter the decease of Huneric, his successor recalled him, and the rest\r\nof the orthodox clergy; the Arians, taking the alarm, persuaded him to\r\nbanish them again, which he complied with, when Eugenius, exiled to\r\nLanguedoc in France, died there of the hardships he underwent on the 6th\r\nof September, A. D. 305.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecutions from about the Middle of the Fifth, to the Conclusion of\r\nthe Seventh Century._\r\n\r\nProterius was made a priest by Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, who was well\r\nacquainted with his virtues, before he appointed him to preach. On the\r\ndeath of Cyril, the see of Alexandria was filled by Discorus, an\r\ninveterate enemy to the memory and family of his predecessor. Being\r\ncondemned by the council of Chalcedon for having embraced the errors of\r\nEutyches, he was deposed, and Proterius chosen to fill the vacant see,\r\nwho was approved of by the emperor. This occasioned a dangerous\r\ninsurrection, for the city of Alexandria was divided into two factions;\r\nthe one to espouse the cause of the old, and the other of the new\r\nprelate. In one of the commotions, the Eutychians determined to wreak\r\ntheir vengeance on Proterius, who fled to the church for sanctuary: but\r\non Good Friday, A. D. 457, a large body of them rushed into the church,\r\nand barbarously murdered the prelate; after which they dragged the body\r\nthrough the streets, insulted it, cut it to pieces, burnt it, and\r\nscattered the ashes in the air.\r\n\r\nHermenigildus, a Gothic prince, was the eldest son of Leovigildus, a\r\nking of the Goths, in Spain. This prince, who was originally an Arian,\r\nbecame a convert to the orthodox faith, by means of his wife Ingonda.\r\nWhen the king heard that his son had changed his religious sentiments,\r\nhe stripped him of the command at Seville, where he was governor, and\r\nthreatened to put him to death unless he renounced the faith he had\r\nnewly embraced. The prince, in order to prevent the execution of his\r\nfather's menaces, began to put himself into a posture of defence; and\r\nmany of the orthodox persuasion in Spain declared for him. The king,\r\nexasperated at this act of rebellion, began to punish all the orthodox\r\nchristians who could be seized by his troops; and thus a very severe\r\npersecution commenced: he likewise marched against his son at the head\r\nof a very powerful army. The prince took refuge in Seville, from which\r\nhe fled, and was at length besieged and taken at Asieta. Loaded with\r\nchains, he was sent to Seville, and at the feast of Easter refusing to\r\nreceive the Eucharist from an Arian bishop, the enraged king ordered his\r\nguards to cut the prince to pieces, which they punctually performed,\r\nApril 13, A. D. 586.\r\n\r\nMartin, bishop of Rome, was born at Todi, in Italy. He was naturally\r\ninclined to virtue, and his parents bestowed on him an admirable\r\neducation. He opposed the heretics called Monothothelites, who were\r\npatronized by the emperor Heraclius. Martin was condemned at\r\nConstantinople, where he was exposed in the most public places to the\r\nridicule of the people, divested of all episcopal marks of distinction,\r\nand treated with the greatest scorn and severity. After lying some\r\nmonths in prison, Martin was sent to an island at some distance, and\r\nthere cut to pieces, A. D. 655.\r\n\r\nJohn, bishop of Bergamo, in Lombardy, was a learned man, and a good\r\nchristian. He did his utmost endeavours to clear the church from the\r\nerrors of Arianism, and joining in this holy work with John, bishop of\r\nMilan, he was very successful against the heretics, on which account he\r\nwas assassinated on July 11, A. D. 683.\r\n\r\nKillien was born in Ireland, and received from his parents a pious and\r\nchristian education. He obtained the Roman pontiff's license to preach\r\nto the pagans in Franconia, in Germany. At Wurtzburg he converted\r\nGozbert, the governor, whose example was followed by the greater part of\r\nthe people in two years after. Persuading Gozbert that his marriage with\r\nhis brother's widow was sinful, the latter had him beheaded, A. D. 689.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecutions from the early part of the Eighth, to near the Conclusion\r\nof the Tenth Century._\r\n\r\nBoniface, archbishop of Mentz, and father of the German church, was an\r\nEnglishmen, and is, in ecclesiastical history, looked upon as one of the\r\nbrightest ornaments of this nation. Originally, his name was Winfred, or\r\nWinfrith, and he was born at Kirton, in Devonshire, then part of the\r\nWest-Saxon kingdom. When he was only about six years of age, he began to\r\ndiscover a propensity to reflection, and seemed solicitous to gain\r\ninformation on religious subjects. Wolfrad, the abbot, finding that he\r\npossessed a bright genius, as well as a strong inclination to study, had\r\nhim removed to Nutscelle, a seminary of learning in the diocese of\r\nWinchester, where he would have a much greater opportunity of attaining\r\nimprovement than at Exeter.\r\n\r\nAfter due study, the abbot seeing him qualified for the priesthood,\r\nobliged him to receive that holy order when he was about thirty years\r\nold. From which time he began to preach and labour for the salvation of\r\nhis fellow-creatures; he was released to attend a synod of bishops in\r\nthe kingdom of West-Saxons. He afterwards, in 719, went to Rome, where\r\nGregory II. who then sat in Peter's chair, received him with great\r\nfriendship, and finding him full of all the virtues that compose the\r\ncharacter of an apostolic missionary, dismissed him with commission at\r\nlarge to preach the gospel to the pagans wherever he found them.\r\nPassing through Lombardy and Bavaria, he came to Thuringia, which\r\ncountry had before received the light of the gospel, he next visited\r\nUtrecht, and then proceeded to Saxony, where he converted some thousands\r\nto christianity.\r\n\r\nDuring the ministry of this meek prelate, Pepin was declared king of\r\nFrance. It was that prince's ambition to be crowned by the most holy\r\nprelate he could find, and Boniface was pitched on to perform that\r\nceremony, which he did at Soissons, in 752. The next year, his great age\r\nand many infirmities lay so heavy on him, that, with the consent of the\r\nnew king, the bishops, &c. of his diocese, he consecrated Lullus, his\r\ncountryman, and faithful disciple, and placed him in the see of Mentz.\r\nWhen he had thus eased himself of his charge, he recommended the church\r\nof Mentz to the care of the new bishop in very strong terms, desired he\r\nwould finish the church at Fuld, and see him buried in it, for his end\r\nwas near. Having left these orders, he took boat to the Rhine, and went\r\nto Friesland, where he converted and baptized several thousands of\r\nbarbarous natives, demolished the temples, and raised churches on the\r\nruins of those superstitious structures. A day being appointed for\r\nconfirming a great number of new converts, he ordered them to assemble\r\nin a new open plain, near the river Bourde. Thither he repaired the day\r\nbefore; and, pitching a tent, determined to remain on the spot all\r\nnight, in order to be ready early in the morning.\r\n\r\nSome pagans, who were his inveterate enemies, having intelligence of\r\nthis, poured down upon him and the companions of his mission in the\r\nnight, and killed him and fifty-two of his companions and attendants on\r\nJune 5, A. D. 755. Thus fell the great father of the Germanic church,\r\nthe honour of England, and the glory of the age in which he lived.\r\n\r\nForty-two persons of Armorian in Upper Phrygia, were martyred in the\r\nyear 845, by the Saracens, the circumstances of which transaction are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Theophilus, the Saracens ravaged many parts of the\r\neastern empire, gained several considerable advantages over the\r\nchristians, took the city of Armorian, and numbers suffered martyrdom.\r\n\r\nFlora and Mary, two ladies of distinction, suffered martyrdom at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nPerfectus was born at Corduba, in Spain, and brought up in the christian\r\nfaith. Having a quick genius, he made himself master of all the useful\r\nand polite literature of that age; and at the same time was not more\r\ncelebrated for his abilities than admired for his piety. At length he\r\ntook priest's orders, and performed the duties of his office with great\r\nassiduity and punctuality. Publicly declaring Mahomet an impostor, he\r\nwas sentenced to be beheaded, and was accordingly executed, A. D. 850;\r\nafter which his body was honourably interred by the christians.\r\n\r\nAdalbert, bishop of Prague, a Bohemian by birth, after being involved\r\nin many troubles, began to direct his thoughts to the conversion of the\r\ninfidels, to which end he repaired to Dantzic, where he converted and\r\nbaptised many, which so enraged the pagan priests, that they fell upon\r\nhim, and despatched him with darts, on the 23d of April, A. D. 997.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecutions in the Eleventh Century._\r\n\r\nAlphage, archbishop of Canterbury, was descended from a considerable\r\nfamily in Gloucestershire, and received an education suitable to his\r\nillustrious birth. His parents were worthy christians, and Alphage\r\nseemed to inherit their virtues.\r\n\r\nThe see of Winchester being vacant by the death of Ethelwold, Dunstan,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, as primate of all England, consecrated Alphage\r\nto the vacant bishopric, to the general satisfaction of all concerned in\r\nthe diocese.\r\n\r\nDunstan had an extraordinary veneration for Alphage, and, when at the\r\npoint of death, made it his ardent request to God, that he might succeed\r\nhim in the see of Canterbury; which accordingly happened, though not\r\ntill about eighteen years after Dunstan's death in 1006.\r\n\r\nAfter Alphage had governed the see of Canterbury about four years, with\r\ngreat reputation to himself, and benefit to his people, the Danes made\r\nan incursion into England, and laid siege to Canterbury. When the design\r\nof attacking this city was known, many of the principal people made a\r\nflight from it, and would have persuaded Alphage to follow their\r\nexample. But he, like a good pastor, would not listen to such a\r\nproposal. While he was employed in assisting and encouraging the people,\r\nCanterbury was taken by storm; the enemy poured into the town, and\r\ndestroyed all that came in their way by fire and sword. He had the\r\ncourage to address the enemy, and offer himself to their swords, as more\r\nworthy of their rage than the people: he begged they might be saved, and\r\nthat they would discharge their whole fury upon him. They accordingly\r\nseized him, tied his hands, insulted and abused him in a rude and\r\nbarbarous manner, and obliged him to remain on the spot until his church\r\nwas burnt, and the monks massacred. They then decimated all the\r\ninhabitants, both ecclesiastics and laymen, leaving only every tenth\r\nperson alive; so that they put 7236 persons to death, and left only four\r\nmonks and 800 laymen alive, after which they confined the archbishop in\r\na dungeon, where they kept him close prisoner for several months.\r\n\r\nDuring his confinement they proposed to him to redeem his liberty with\r\nthe sum of L3000, and to persuade the king to purchase their departure\r\nout of the kingdom, with a further sum of L10,000. As Alphage's\r\ncircumstances would not allow him to satisfy the exorbitant demand, they\r\nbound him, and put him to severe torments, to oblige him to discover the\r\ntreasure of the church; upon which they assured him of his life and\r\nliberty, but the prelate piously persisted in refusing to give the\r\npagans any account of it. They remanded him to prison again, confined\r\nhim six days longer, and then, taking him prisoner with them to\r\nGreenwich, brought him to trial there. He still remained inflexible with\r\nrespect to the church treasure; but exhorted them to forsake their\r\nidolatry, and embrace christianity. This so greatly incensed the Danes,\r\nthat the soldiers dragged him out of the camp, and beat him\r\nunmercifully. One of the soldiers, who had been converted by him,\r\nknowing that his pains would be lingering, as his death was determined\r\non, actuated by a kind of barbarous compassion, cut off his head, and\r\nthus put the finishing stroke to his martyrdom, April 19, A. D. 1012.\r\nThis transaction happened on the very spot where the church at\r\nGreenwich, which is dedicated to him, now stands. After his death his\r\nbody was thrown into the Thames, but being found the next day, it was\r\nburied in the cathedral of St. Paul's by the bishops of London and\r\nLincoln; from whence it was, in 1023, removed to Canterbury by\r\nEthelmoth, the archbishop of that province.\r\n\r\nGerard, a Venitian, devoted himself to the service of God from his\r\ntender years: entered into a religious house for some time, and then\r\ndetermined to visit the Holy Land. Going into Hungary, he became\r\nacquainted with Stephen, the king of that country, who made him bishop\r\nof Chonad.\r\n\r\nOuvo and Peter, successors of Stephen, being deposed, Andrew, son of\r\nLadislaus, cousin-german to Stephen, had then a tender of the crown made\r\nhim upon condition that he would employ his authority in extirpating the\r\nchristian religion out of Hungary. The ambitious prince came into the\r\nproposal, but Gerard being informed of his impious bargain, thought it\r\nhis duty to remonstrate against the enormity of Andrew's crime, and\r\npersuade him to withdraw his promise. In this view he undertook to go to\r\nthat prince, attended by three prelates, full of like zeal for religion.\r\nThe new king was at Alba Regalis, but, as the four bishops were going to\r\ncross the Danube, they were stopped by a party of soldiers posted there.\r\nThey bore an attack of a shower of stones patiently, when the soldiers\r\nbeat them unmercifully, and at length despatched them with lances. Their\r\nmartyrdoms happened in the year 1045.\r\n\r\nStanislaus, bishop of Cracow, was descended from an illustrious Polish\r\nfamily. The piety of his parents was equal to their opulence, and the\r\nlatter they rendered subservient to all the purposes of charity and\r\nbenevolence. Stanislaus remained for some time undetermined, whether he\r\nshould embrace a monastic life, or engage among the secular clergy. He\r\nwas at length persuaded to the latter by Lambert Zula, bishop of Cracow,\r\nwho gave him holy orders, and made him a canon of his cathedral. Lambert\r\ndied on November 25, 1071, when all concerned in the choice of a\r\nsuccessor declared for Stanislaus, and he succeeded to the prelacy.\r\n\r\nBolislaus, the second king of Poland, had, by nature, many good\r\nqualities, but giving away to his passions he ran into many enormities,\r\nand at length had the appellation of Cruel bestowed upon him.\r\nStanislaus alone had the courage to tell him of his faults, when, taking\r\na private opportunity, he freely displayed to him the enormities of his\r\ncrimes. The king, greatly exasperated at his repeated freedoms, at\r\nlength determined, at any rate, to get the better of a prelate who was\r\nso extremely faithful. Hearing one day that the bishop was by himself,\r\nin the chapel of St. Michael, at a small distance from the town, he\r\ndespatched some soldiers to murder him. The soldiers readily undertook\r\nthe bloody task; but, when they came into the presence of Stanislaus,\r\nthe venerable aspect of the prelate struck them with such awe, that they\r\ncould not perform what they had promised. On their return, the king,\r\nfinding that they had not obeyed his orders, stormed at them violently,\r\nsnatched a dagger from one of them, and ran furiously to the chapel,\r\nwhere, finding Stanislaus at the altar, he plunged the weapon into his\r\nheart. The prelate immediately expired on the 8th of May, A. D. 1079.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPAPAL PERSECUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far our history of persecution has been confined principally to the\r\npagan world. We come now to a period, when persecution under the guise\r\nof christianity, committed more enormities than ever disgraced the\r\nannals of paganism. Disregarding the maxims and the spirit of the\r\ngospel, the papal church, arming herself with the power of the sword,\r\nvexed the church of God and wasted it for several centuries, a period\r\nmost appropriately termed in history, the \"dark ages.\" The kings of the\r\nearth, gave their power to the \"beast,\" and submitted to be trodden on\r\nby the miserable vermin that often filled the papal chair, as in the\r\ncase of Henry, emperor of Germany. The storm of papal persecution first\r\nburst upon the Waldenses in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecution of the Waldenses in France._\r\n\r\nPopery having brought various innovations into the church, and\r\noverspread the christian world with darkness and superstition, some few,\r\nwho plainly perceived the pernicious tendency of such errors, determined\r\nto show the light of the gospel in its real purity, and to disperse\r\nthose clouds which artful priests had raised about it, in order to blind\r\nthe people, and obscure its real brightness.\r\n\r\nThe principal among these was Berengarius, who, about the year 1000,\r\nboldly preached gospel truths, according to their primitive purity.\r\nMany, from conviction, assented to his doctrine, and were, on that\r\naccount, called Berengarians. To Berengarius succeeded Peter Bruis, who\r\npreached at Thoulouse, under the protection of an earl, named\r\nHildephonsus; and the whole tenets of the reformers, with the reasons of\r\ntheir separation from the church of Rome, were published in a book\r\nwritten by Bruis, under the title of ANTI-CHRIST.\r\n\r\nBy the year of Christ 1140, the number of the reformed was very great,\r\nand the probability of its increasing alarmed the pope, who wrote to\r\nseveral princes to banish them from their dominions, and employed many\r\nlearned men to write against their doctrines.\r\n\r\nA. D. 1147, Henry of Thoulouse, being deemed their most eminent\r\npreacher, they were called Henericians; and as they would not admit of\r\nany proofs relative to religion, but what could be deduced from the\r\nscriptures themselves, the popish party gave them the name of\r\napostolics. At length, Peter Waldo, or Valdo, a native of Lyons, eminent\r\nfor his piety and learning, became a strenuous opposer of popery; and\r\nfrom him the reformed, at that time, received the appellation of\r\nWaldenses or Waldoys.\r\n\r\nPope Alexander III being informed by the bishop of Lyons of these\r\ntransactions, excommunicated Waldo and his adherents, and commanded the\r\nbishop to exterminate them, if possible, from the face of the earth; and\r\nhence began the papal persecutions against the Waldenses.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of Waldo and the reformed, occasioned the first rise of\r\nthe inquisitors; for pope Innocent III. authorized certain monks as\r\ninquisitors, to inquire for, and deliver over, the reformed to the\r\nsecular power. The process was short, as an accusation was deemed\r\nadequate to guilt, and a candid trial was never granted to the accused.\r\n\r\nThe pope, finding that these cruel means had not the intended effect,\r\nsent several learned monks to preach among the Waldenses, and to\r\nendeavour to argue them out of their opinions. Among these monks was one\r\nDominic, who appeared extremely zealous in the cause of popery. This\r\nDominic instituted an order, which, from him, was called the order of\r\nDominican friars; and the members of this order have ever since been the\r\nprincipal inquisitors in the various inquisitions in the world. The\r\npower of the inquisitors was unlimited; they proceeded against whom they\r\npleased, without any consideration of age, sex, or rank. Let the\r\naccusers be ever so infamous, the accusation was deemed valid; and even\r\nanonymous informations, sent by letter, were thought sufficient\r\nevidence. To be rich was a crime equal to heresy; therefore many who had\r\nmoney were accused of heresy, or of being favourers of heretics, that\r\nthey might be obliged to pay for their opinions. The dearest friends or\r\nnearest kindred could not, without danger, serve any one who was\r\nimprisoned on account of religion. To convey to those who were confined,\r\na little straw, or give them a cup of water, was called favouring of the\r\nheretics, and they were prosecuted accordingly. No lawyer dared to plead\r\nfor his own brother, and their malice even extended beyond the grave;\r\nhence the bones of many were dug up and burnt, as examples to the\r\nliving. If a man on his death-bed was accused of being a follower of\r\nWaldo, his estates were confiscated, and the heir to them defrauded of\r\nhis inheritance; and some were sent to the Holy Land, while the\r\nDominicans took possession of their houses and properties, and, when the\r\nowners returned, would often pretend not to know them. These\r\npersecutions were continued for several centuries under different popes\r\nand other great dignitaries of the catholic church.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecutions of the Albigenses._\r\n\r\nThe Albigenses were a people of the reformed religion, who inhabited the\r\ncountry of Albi. They were condemned on the score of religion, in the\r\ncouncil of Lateran, by order of Pope Alexander III. Nevertheless, they\r\nincreased so prodigiously, that many cities were inhabited by persons\r\nonly of their persuasion, and several eminent noblemen embraced their\r\ndoctrines. Among the latter were Raymond earl of Thoulouse, Raymond earl\r\nof Foix, the earl of Beziers, &c.\r\n\r\nA friar, named Peter, having been murdered in the dominions of the earl\r\nof Thoulouse, the pope made the murder a pretence to persecute that\r\nnobleman and his subjects. To effect this, he sent persons throughout\r\nall Europe, in order to raise forces to act coercively against the\r\nAlbigenses, and promised paradise to all that would come to this war,\r\nwhich he termed a Holy War, and bear arms for forty days. The same\r\nindulgences were likewise held out to all who entered themselves for the\r\npurpose as to such as engaged in crusades to the Holy Land. The brave\r\nearl defended Thoulouse and other places with the most heroic bravery\r\nand various success against the pope's legates and Simon earl of\r\nMontfort, a bigoted catholic nobleman. Unable to subdue the earl of\r\nThoulouse openly, the king of France, and queen mother, and three\r\narchbishops, raised another formidable army, and had the art to persuade\r\nthe earl of Thoulouse to come to a conference, when he was treacherously\r\nseized upon, made a prisoner, forced to appear bare-footed and\r\nbare-headed before his enemies, and compelled to subscribe an abject\r\nrecantation. This was followed by a severe persecution against the\r\nAlbigenses; and express orders that the laity should not be permitted to\r\nread the sacred scriptures. In the year 1620 also the persecution\r\nagainst the Albigenses was very severe. In 1648 a heavy persecution\r\nraged throughout Lithuania and Poland. The cruelty of the Cossacks was\r\nso excessive, that the Tartars themselves were ashamed of their\r\nbarbarities. Among others who suffered, was the Rev. Adrian Chalinski,\r\nwho was roasted alive by a slow fire, and whose sufferings and mode of\r\ndeath may depict the horrors which the professors of christianity have\r\nendured from the enemies of the Redeemer.\r\n\r\nThe reformation of papistical error very early was projected in France;\r\nfor in the third century a learned man, named Almericus, and six of his\r\ndisciples, were ordered to be burnt at Paris, for asserting that God was\r\nno otherwise present in the sacramental bread than in any other bread;\r\nthat it was idolatry to build altars or shrines to saints and that it\r\nwas ridiculous to offer incense to them.\r\n\r\nThe martyrdom of Almericus and his pupils did not, however, prevent many\r\nfrom acknowledging the justness of his notions, and seeing the purity of\r\nthe reformed religion, so that the truth of Christ continually\r\nincreased, and in time not only spread itself over many parts of France,\r\nbut diffused the light of the gospel over various other countries.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1524, at a town in France, called Melden, one John Clark set\r\nup a bill on the church door, wherein he called the pope Anti-christ.\r\nFor this offence he was repeatedly whipped, and then branded on the\r\nforehead. Going afterward to Mentz, in Lorraine, he demolished some\r\nimages, for which he had his right hand and nose cut off, and his arms\r\nand breasts torn with pincers. He sustained these cruelties with amazing\r\nfortitude, and was even sufficiently cool to sing the 115th psalm, which\r\nexpressly forbids idolatry; after which he was thrown into the fire, and\r\nburnt to ashes.\r\n\r\nMany persons of the reformed persuasion were, about this time, beaten,\r\nracked, scourged, and burnt to death, in several parts of France but\r\nmore particularly at Paris, Malda, and Limosin.\r\n\r\nA native of Malda was burnt by a slow fire, for saying that mass was a\r\nplain denial of the death and passion of Christ. At Limosin, John de\r\nCadurco, a clergyman of the reformed religion, was apprehended,\r\ndegraded, and ordered to be burnt.\r\n\r\nFrancis Bribard, secretary to cardinal de Pellay, for speaking in favour\r\nof the reformed, had his tongue cut out, and was then burnt, A. D. 1545.\r\nJames Cobard, a schoolmaster in the city of St. Michael, was burnt, A.\r\nD. 1545, for saying \"That mass was useless and absurd;\" and about the\r\nsame time, fourteen men were burnt at Malda, their wives being compelled\r\nto stand by and behold the execution.\r\n\r\nA. D. 1546, Peter Chapot brought a number of bibles in the French tongue\r\nto France, and publicly sold them there; for which he was brought to\r\ntrial, sentenced, and executed a few days afterward. Soon after, a\r\ncripple of Meaux, a schoolmaster of Fera, named Stephen Polliot, and a\r\nman named John English, were burnt for the faith.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Blondel, a rich jeweller, was, A. D. 1548, apprehended at\r\nLyons, and sent to Paris; where he was burnt for the faith, by order of\r\nthe court, A. D. 1549. Herbert, a youth of nineteen years of age, was\r\ncommitted to the flames at Dijon; as was Florent Venote, in the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1554, two men of the reformed religion, with the son and\r\ndaughter of one of them, were apprehended and committed to the castle of\r\nNiverne. On examination, they confessed their faith, and were ordered\r\nfor execution; being smeared with grease, brimstone, and gunpowder, they\r\ncried, \"Salt on, salt on this sinful and rotten flesh!\" Their tongues\r\nwere then cut out, and they were afterward committed to the flames,\r\nwhich soon consumed them, by means of the combustible matter with which\r\nthey were besmeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bartholomew Massacre at Paris, &c._\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of August, 1572, commenced this diabolical act of sanguinary\r\nbrutality. It was intended to destroy at one stroke the root of the\r\nprotestant tree, which had only before partially suffered in its\r\nbranches. The king of France had artfully proposed a marriage between\r\nhis sister and the prince of Navarre, the captain and prince of the\r\nprotestants. This imprudent marriage was publicly celebrated at Paris,\r\nAugust 18, by the cardinal of Bourbon, upon a high stage erected for the\r\npurpose. They dined in great pomp with the bishop, and supped with the\r\nking at Paris. Four days after this, the prince, as he was coming from\r\nthe council, was shot in both arms; he then said to Maure, his deceased\r\nmother's minister, \"O my brother, I do now perceive that I am indeed\r\nbeloved of my God, since for his most holy sake I am wounded.\" Although\r\nthe Vidam advised him to fly, yet he abode in Paris, and was soon after\r\nslain by Bemjus; who afterward declared he never saw a man meet death\r\nmore valiantly than the admiral. The soldiers were appointed at a\r\ncertain signal to burst out instantly to the slaughter in all parts of\r\nthe city. When they had killed the admiral, they threw him out at a\r\nwindow into the street, where his head was cut off, and sent to the\r\npope. The savage papists, still raging against him, cut off his arms and\r\nprivate members, and, after dragging him three days through the streets,\r\nhung him up by the heels without the city. After him they slew many\r\ngreat and honourable persons who were protestants; as count\r\nRochfoucault, Telinius, the admiral's son-in-law, Antonius, Clarimontus,\r\nmarquis of Ravely, Lewes Bussius, Bandineus, Pluvialius, Burneius, &c.\r\n&c. and falling upon the common people, they continued the slaughter for\r\nmany days; in the three first, they slew of all ranks and conditions to\r\nthe number of 10,000. The bodies were thrown into the rivers, and blood\r\nran through the streets with a strong current, and the river appeared\r\npresently like a stream of blood. So furious was their hellish rage,\r\nthat they slew all papists whom they suspected to be not very staunch to\r\ntheir diabolical religion. From Paris the destruction spread to all\r\nquarters of the realm.\r\n\r\nAt Orleans, a thousand were slain of men, women, and children, and 6000\r\nat Rouen.\r\n\r\nAt Meldith, two hundred were put into prison, and brought out by units,\r\nand cruelly murdered.\r\n\r\nAt Lyons, eight hundred were massacred. Here children hanging about\r\ntheir parents, and parents affectionately embracing their children, were\r\npleasant food for the swords and blood-thirsty minds of those who call\r\nthemselves the catholic church. Here 300 were slain only in the bishop's\r\nhouse; and the impious monks would suffer none to be buried.\r\n\r\nAt Augustobona, on the people hearing of the massacre at Paris, they\r\nshut their gates that no protestants might escape, and searching\r\ndiligently for every individual of the reformed church, imprisoned and\r\nthen barbarously murdered them. The same cruelty they practised at\r\nAvaricum, at Troys, at Thoulouse, Rouen and many other places, running\r\nfrom city to city, towns, and villages, through the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs a corroboration of this horrid carnage, the following interesting\r\nnarrative, written by a sensible and learned Roman catholic, appears in\r\nthis place, with peculiar propriety.\r\n\r\n\"The nuptials (says he) of the young king of Navarre with the French\r\nking's sister, was solemnized with pomp; and all the endearments, all\r\nthe assurances of friendship, all the oaths sacred among men, were\r\nprofusely lavished by Catharine, the queen-mother, and by the king;\r\nduring which, the rest of the court thought of nothing but festivities,\r\nplays, and masquerades. At last, at twelve o'clock at night, on the eve\r\nof St. Bartholomew, the signal was given. Immediately all the houses of\r\nthe protestants were forced open at once. Admiral Coligni, alarmed by\r\nthe uproar jumped out of bed; when a company of assassins rushed in his\r\nchamber. They were headed by one Besme, who had been bred up as a\r\ndomestic in the family of the Guises. This wretch thrust his sword into\r\nthe admiral's breast, and also cut him in the face. Besme was a German,\r\nand being afterwards taken by the protestants, the Rochellers would have\r\nbought him, in order to hang and quarter him; but he was killed by one\r\nBretanville. Henry, the young duke of Guise, who afterwards framed the\r\ncatholic league, and was murdered at Blois, standing at the door till\r\nthe horrid butchery should be completed, called aloud, 'Besme! is it\r\ndone?' Immediately after which, the ruffians threw the body out of the\r\nwindow, and Coligni expired at Guise's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Count de Teligny also fell a sacrifice. He had married, about ten\r\nmonths before, Coligni's daughter. His countenance was so engaging, that\r\nthe ruffians, when they advanced in order to kill him, were struck with\r\ncompassion; but others, more barbarous, rushing forward, murdered him.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime, all the friends of Coligni were assassinated\r\nthroughout Paris; men, women, and children, were promiscuously\r\nslaughtered; every street was strewed with expiring bodies. Some\r\npriests, holding up a crucifix in one hand, and a dagger in the other,\r\nran to the chiefs of the murderers, and strongly exhorted them to spare\r\nneither relations nor friends.\r\n\r\n\"Tavannes, marshal of France, an ignorant, superstitious soldier, who\r\njoined the fury of religion to the rage of party, rode on horseback\r\nthrough the streets of Paris, crying to his men, 'Let blood! let blood!\r\nbleeding is as wholesome in August as in May.' In the memoirs of the\r\nlife of this enthusiastic, written by his son, we are told, that the\r\nfather, being on his death-bed, and making a general confession of his\r\nactions, the priest said to him, with surprise, 'What! no mention of St.\r\nBartholomew's massacre?' to which Tavannes replied, 'I consider it as a\r\nmeritorious action, that will wash away all my sins.' Such horrid\r\nsentiments can a false spirit of religion inspire!\r\n\r\n\"The king's palace was one of the chief scenes of the butchery: the king\r\nof Navarre had his lodgings in the Louvre, and all his domestics were\r\nprotestants. Many of these were killed in bed with their wives; others,\r\nrunning away naked, were pursued by the soldiers through the several\r\nrooms of the palace, even to the king's antichamber. The young wife of\r\nHenry of Navarre, awaked by the dreadful uproar, being afraid for her\r\nconsort, and for her own life, seized with horror, and half dead, flew\r\nfrom her bed, in order to throw herself at the feet of the king her\r\nbrother. But scarce had she opened her chamber-door, when some of her\r\nprotestant domestics rushed in for refuge. The soldiers immediately\r\nfollowed, pursued them in sight of the princess, and killed one who had\r\ncrept under her bed. Two others, being wounded with halberds, fell at\r\nthe queen's feet, so that she was covered with blood.\r\n\r\n\"Count de la Rochefoucault, a young nobleman, greatly in the king's\r\nfavour for his comely air, his politeness, and a certain peculiar\r\nhappiness in the turn of his conversation, had spent the evening till\r\neleven o'clock with the monarch, in pleasant familiarity; and had given\r\na loose, with the utmost mirth, to the sallies of his imagination. The\r\nmonarch felt some remorse, and being touched with a kind of compassion,\r\nbid him, two or three times, not to go home, but lie in the Louvre. The\r\ncount said, he must go to his wife; upon which the king pressed him no\r\nfarther, but said, 'Let him go! I see God has decreed his death.' And in\r\ntwo hours after he was murdered.\r\n\r\n\"Very few of the protestants escaped the fury of their enthusiastic\r\npersecutors. Among these was young La Force (afterwards the famous\r\nMarshal de la Force) a child about ten years of age, whose deliverance\r\nwas exceedingly remarkable. His father, his elder brother, and himself\r\nwere seized together by the Duke of Anjou's soldiers. These murderers\r\nflew at all three, and struck them at random, when they all fell, and\r\nlay one upon another. The youngest did not receive a single blow, but\r\nappearing as if he was dead, escaped the next day; and his life, thus\r\nwonderfully preserved, lasted four score and five years.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the wretched victims fled to the water-side, and some swam over\r\nthe Seine to the suburbs of St. Germaine. The king saw them from his\r\nwindow, which looked upon the river, and fired upon them with a carbine\r\nthat had been loaded for that purpose by one of his pages; while the\r\nqueen-mother, undisturbed and serene in the midst of slaughter, looking\r\ndown from a balcony, encouraged the murderers and laughed at the dying\r\ngroans of the slaughtered. This barbarous queen was fired with a\r\nrestless ambition, and she perpetually shifted her party in order to\r\nsatiate it.\r\n\r\n\"Some days after this horrid transaction, the French court endeavoured\r\nto palliate it by forms of law. They pretended to justify the massacre\r\nby a calumny, and accused the admiral of a conspiracy, which no one\r\nbelieved. The parliament was commanded to proceed against the memory of\r\nColigni; and his dead body was hung in chains on Montfaucon gallows.\r\nThe king himself went to view this shocking spectacle; when one of his\r\ncourtiers advising him to retire, and complaining of the stench of the\r\ncorpse, he replied, 'A dead enemy smells well.'--The massacres on St.\r\nBartholomew's day are painted in the royal saloon of the Vatican at\r\nRome, with the following inscription: _Pontifex_ Coligni _necem probat_,\r\ni. e. 'The pope approves of Coligni's death.'\r\n\r\n\"The young king of Navarre was spared through policy, rather than from\r\nthe pity of the queen-mother, she keeping him prisoner till the king's\r\ndeath, in order that he might be as a security and pledge for the\r\nsubmission of such protestants as might effect their escape.\r\n\r\n\"This horrid butchery was not confined merely to the city of Paris. The\r\nlike orders were issued from court to the governors of all the provinces\r\nin France; so that, in a week's time, about one hundred thousand\r\nprotestants were cut to pieces in different parts of the kingdom! Two or\r\nthree governors only refused to obey the king's orders. One of these,\r\nnamed Montmorrin, governor of Auvergne, wrote the king the following\r\nletter, which deserves to be transmitted to the latest posterity.\r\n\r\n\"SIRE--I have received an order, under your majesty's seal, to put to\r\ndeath all the protestants in my province. I have too much respect for\r\nyour majesty, not to believe the letter a forgery; but if (which God\r\nforbid) the order should be genuine, I have too much respect for your\r\nmajesty to obey it.\"\r\n\r\nAt Rome the horrid joy was so great, that they appointed a day of high\r\nfestival, and a jubilee, with great indulgence to all who kept it and\r\nshowed every expression of gladness they could devise! and the man who\r\nfirst carried the news received 1000 crowns of the cardinal of Lorrain\r\nfor his ungodly message. The king also commanded the day to be kept with\r\nevery demonstration of joy, concluding now that the whole race of\r\nHuguenots was extinct.\r\n\r\nMany who gave great sums of money for their ransom were immediately\r\nafter slain; and several towns, which were under the king's promise of\r\nprotection and safety, were cut off as soon as they delivered themselves\r\nup, on those promises, to his generals or captains.\r\n\r\nAt Bordeaux, at the instigation of a villanous monk, who used to urge\r\nthe papists to slaughter in his sermons, 264 were cruelly murdered; some\r\nof them senators. Another of the same pious fraternity produced a\r\nsimilar slaughter at Agendicum, in Maine, where the populace at the holy\r\ninquisitors' satanical suggestion, ran upon the protestants, slew them,\r\nplundered their houses, and pulled down their church.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Guise, entering into Bloise, suffered his soldiers to fly\r\nupon the spoil, and slay or drown all the protestants they could find.\r\nIn this they spared neither age nor sex; defiling the women, and then\r\nmurdering them; from whence he went to Mere, and committed the same\r\noutrages for many days together. Here they found a minister named\r\nCassebonius, and threw him into the river.\r\n\r\nAt Anjou, they slew Albiacus, a minister; and many women were defiled\r\nand murdered there; among whom were two sisters, abused before their\r\nfather, whom the assassins bound to a wall to see them, and then slew\r\nthem and him.\r\n\r\nThe president of Turin, after giving a large sum for his life, was\r\ncruelly beaten with clubs, stripped of his clothes, and hung feet\r\nupwards, with his head and breast in the river: before he was dead, they\r\nopened his belly, plucked out his entrails, and threw them into the\r\nriver; and then carried his heart about the city upon a spear.\r\n\r\nAt Barre great cruelty was used, even to young children, whom they cut\r\nopen, pulled out their entrails, which through very rage they knawed\r\nwith their teeth. Those who had fled to the castle, when they yielded,\r\nwere almost all hanged. Thus they did at the city of Matiscon; counting\r\nit sport to cut off their arms and legs and afterward kill them; and for\r\nthe entertainment of their visiters, they often threw the protestants\r\nfrom a high bridge into the river, saying, \"Did you ever see men leap so\r\nwell?\"\r\n\r\nAt Penna, after promising them safety, 300 were inhumanly butchered; and\r\nfive and forty at Albin, on the Lord's day. At Nonne, though it yielded\r\non conditions of safeguard, the most horrid spectacles were exhibited.\r\nPersons of both sexes and conditions were indiscriminately murdered; the\r\nstreets ringing with doleful cries, and flowing with blood; and the\r\nhouses flaming with fire, which the abandoned soldiers had thrown in.\r\nOne woman, being dragged from her hiding place with her husband, was\r\nfirst abused by the brutal soldiers, and then with a sword which they\r\ncommanded her to draw, they forced it while in her hands into the bowels\r\nof her husband.\r\n\r\nAt Samarobridge, they murdered above 100 protestants, after promising\r\nthem peace; and at Antisidor, 100 were killed, and cast part into a\r\njakes, and part into a river. One hundred put into prison at Orleans,\r\nwere destroyed by the furious multitude.\r\n\r\nThe protestants at Rochelle, who were such as had miraculously escaped\r\nthe rage of hell, and fled there, seeing how ill they fared who\r\nsubmitted to those holy devils, stood for their lives; and some other\r\ncities, encouraged thereby, did the like. Against Rochelle, the king\r\nsent almost the whole power of France, which besieged it seven months,\r\nthough, by their assaults, they did very little execution on the\r\ninhabitants, yet, by famine, they destroyed eighteen thousand out of two\r\nand twenty. The dead being too numerous for the living to bury, became\r\nfood for vermin and carnivorous birds. Many taking their coffins into\r\nthe church yard, laid down in them, and breathed their last. Their diet\r\nhad long been what the minds of those in plenty shudder at; even human\r\nflesh entrails, dung, and the most loathsome things, became at last the\r\nonly food of those champions for that truth and liberty, of which the\r\nworld was not worthy. At every attack, the besiegers met with such an\r\nintrepid reception, that they left 132 captains, with a proportionate\r\nnumber of men, dead in the field. The siege at last was broken up at\r\nthe request of the duke of Anjou, the king's brother, who was proclaimed\r\nking of Poland, and the king, being wearied out, easily complied,\r\nwhereupon honourable conditions were granted them.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable interference of Providence, that, in all this\r\ndreadful massacre, not more than two ministers of the gospel were\r\ninvolved in it.\r\n\r\nThe tragical sufferings of the protestants are too numerous to detail;\r\nbut the treatment of Philip de Deux will give an idea of the rest. After\r\nthe miscreants had slain this martyr in his bed, they went to his wife,\r\nwho was then attended by the midwife, expecting every moment to be\r\ndelivered. The midwife entreated them to stay the murder, at least till\r\nthe child, which was the twentieth, should be born. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, they thrust a dagger up to the hilt into the poor woman. Anxious\r\nto be delivered, she ran into a corn loft; but hither they pursued her,\r\nstabbed her in the belly, and then threw her into the street. By the\r\nfall, the child came from the dying mother, and being caught up by one\r\nof the catholic ruffians, he stabbed the infant, and then threw it into\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, to the French Revolution in\r\n1789._\r\n\r\nThe persecutions occasioned by the revocation of the edict of Nantes,\r\ntook place under Louis XIV. This edict was made by Henry the Great of\r\nFrance in 1598, and secured to the protestants an equal right in every\r\nrespect, whether civil or religious, with the other subjects of the\r\nrealm. All those privileges Louis the XIII. confirmed to the protestants\r\nby another statute, called the edict of Nismes, and kept them inviolably\r\nto the end of his reign.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Louis XIV. the kingdom was almost ruined by civil\r\nwars. At this critical juncture, the protestants, heedless of our Lord's\r\nadmonition, \"They that take the sword, shall perish with the sword,\"\r\ntook such an active part in favour of the king, that he was constrained\r\nto acknowledge himself indebted to their arms for his establishment on\r\nthe throne. Instead of cherishing and rewarding that party who had\r\nfought for him, he reasoned, that the same power which had protected\r\ncould overturn him, and, listening to the popish machinations, he began\r\nto issue out proscriptions and restrictions, indicative of his final\r\ndetermination. Rochelle was presently fettered with an incredible number\r\nof denunciations. Montaban and Millau were sacked by soldiers. Popish\r\ncommissioners were appointed to preside over the affairs of the\r\nprotestants, and there was no appeal from their ordinance, except to the\r\nking's council. This struck at the root of their civil and religious\r\nexercises, and prevented them, being protestants, from suing a catholic\r\nin any court of law. This was followed by another injunction, to make an\r\ninquiry in all parishes into whatever the protestants had said or done\r\nfor twenty years past. This filled the prisons with innocent victims,\r\nand condemned others to the galleys or banishment. Protestants were\r\nexpelled from all offices, trades, privileges and employs; thereby\r\ndepriving them of the means of getting their bread: and they proceeded\r\nto such excess in their brutality, that they would not suffer even the\r\nmidwives to officiate, but compelled their women to submit themselves in\r\nthat crisis of nature to their enemies, the brutal catholics. Their\r\nchildren were taken from them to be educated by the catholics, and at\r\nseven years made to embrace popery. The reformed were prohibited from\r\nrelieving their own sick or poor, from all private worship, and divine\r\nservice was to be performed in the presence of a popish priest. To\r\nprevent the unfortunate victims from leaving the kingdom, all the\r\npassages on the frontiers were strictly guarded; yet, by the good hand\r\nof God, about 150,000 escaped their vigilance, and emigrated to\r\ndifferent countries to relate the dismal narrative.\r\n\r\nAll that has been related hitherto were only infringements on their\r\nestablished charter, the edict of Nantes. At length the diabolical\r\nrevocation of that edict passed on the 18th of October, 1685, and was\r\nregistered the 22d in the vacation, contrary to all form of law.\r\nInstantly the dragoons were quartered upon the protestants throughout\r\nthe realm, and filled all France with the like news, that the king would\r\nno longer suffer any Huguenots in his kingdom, and therefore they must\r\nresolve to change their religion. Hereupon the intendants in every\r\nparish (which were popish governors and spies set over the protestants)\r\nassembled the reformed inhabitants, and told them, they must without\r\ndelay turn catholics, either freely or by force. The protestants\r\nreplied, \"They were ready to sacrifice their lives and estates to the\r\nking, but their consciences being God's, they could not so dispose of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the troops seized the gates and avenues of the cities, and\r\nplacing guards in all the passages, entered with sword in hand, crying,\r\n\"Die, or be catholics!\" In short, they practised every wickedness and\r\nhorror they could devise, to force them to change their religion.\r\n\r\nThey hung both men and women by their hair or their feet, and smoked\r\nthem with hay till they were nearly dead; and if they still refused to\r\nsign a recantation, they hung them up again and repeated their\r\nbarbarities, till, wearied out with torments without death, they forced\r\nmany to yield to them.\r\n\r\nOthers, they plucked off all the hair of their heads and beards with\r\npincers. Others they threw on great fires, and pulled them out again,\r\nrepeating it till they extorted a promise to recant.\r\n\r\nSome they stripped naked, and after offering them the most infamous\r\ninsults, they stuck them with pins from head to foot, and lanced them\r\nwith penknives; and sometimes with red-hot pincers they dragged them by\r\nthe nose till they promised to turn. Sometimes they tied fathers and\r\nhusbands, while they ravished their wives and daughters before their\r\neyes. Multitudes they imprisoned in the most noisome dungeons, where\r\nthey practised all sorts of torments in secret. Their wives and children\r\nthey shut up in monasteries.\r\n\r\nSuch as endeavoured to escape by flight were pursued in the woods and\r\nhunted in the fields, and shot at like wild beasts; nor did any\r\ncondition or quality screen them from the ferocity of these infernal\r\ndragoons: even the members of parliament and military officers, though\r\non actual service, were ordered to quit their posts, and repair directly\r\nto their houses to suffer the like storm. Such as complained to the king\r\nwere sent to the Bastile, where they drank of the same cup. The bishops\r\nand the intendants marched at the head of the dragoons, with a troop of\r\nmissionaries, monks, and other ecclesiastics, to animate the soldiers to\r\nan execution so agreeable to their holy church, and so glorious to their\r\ndemon god and their tyrant king.\r\n\r\nIn forming the edict to repeal the edict of Nantes, the council were\r\ndivided; some would have all the ministers detained and forced into\r\npopery as well as the laity: others were for banishing them, because\r\ntheir presence would strengthen the protestants in perseverance: and if\r\nthey were forced to turn, they would ever be secret and powerful enemies\r\nin the bosom of the church, by their great knowledge and experience in\r\ncontroversial matters. This reason prevailing, they were sentenced to\r\nbanishment, and only fifteen days allowed them to depart the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe same day the edict for revoking the protestant's charter was\r\npublished, they demolished their churches, and banished their ministers,\r\nwhom they allowed but twenty-four hours to leave Paris. The papists\r\nwould not suffer them to dispose of their effects, and threw every\r\nobstacle in their way to delay their escape till the limited time was\r\nexpired which subjected them to condemnation for life to the galleys.\r\nThe guards were doubled at the seaports, and the prisons were filled\r\nwith the victims, who endured torments and wants at which human nature\r\nmust shudder.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the ministers and others, who were sent to the\r\ngalleys, seemed to exceed all. Chained to the oar, they were exposed to\r\nthe open air night and day, at all seasons, and in all weathers; and\r\nwhen through weakness of body they fainted under the oar, instead of a\r\ncordial to revive them, or viands to refresh them, they received only\r\nthe lashes of a scourge, or the blows of a cane or rope's end. For the\r\nwant of sufficient clothing and necessary cleanliness, they were most\r\ngrievously tormented with vermin, and cruelly pinched with the cold,\r\nwhich removed by night the executioners who beat and tormented them by\r\nday. Instead of a bed, they were allowed, sick or well, only a hard\r\nboard, eighteen inches broad, to sleep on, without any covering but\r\ntheir wretched apparel; which was a shirt of the coarsest canvass, a\r\nlittle jerkin of red serge, slit up each side up to the arm-holes, with\r\nopen sleeves that reached not to the elbow; and once in three years they\r\nhad a coarse frock, and a little cap to cover their heads, which were\r\nalways kept close shaved as a mark of their infamy. The allowance of\r\nprovision was as narrow as the sentiments of those who condemned them\r\nto such miseries, and their treatment when sick is too shocking to\r\nrelate, doomed to die upon the boards of a dark hold; covered with\r\nvermin, and without the least convenience for the calls of nature. Nor\r\nwas it among the least of the horrors they endured, that, as ministers\r\nof Christ, and honest men, they were chained side by side to felons and\r\nthe most execrable villains, whose blasphemous tongues were never idle.\r\nIf they refused to hear mass, they were sentenced to the bastinado, of\r\nwhich dreadful punishment the following is a description. Preparatory to\r\nit, the chains are taken off, and the victims delivered into the hands\r\nof the Turks that preside at the oars, who strip them quite naked, and\r\nstretching them upon a great gun, they are held so that they cannot\r\nstir; during which there reigns an awful silence throughout the galley.\r\nThe Turk who is appointed the executioner, and who thinks the sacrifice\r\nacceptable to his prophet Mahomet, most cruelly beats the wretched\r\nvictim with a rough cudgel, or knotty rope's end, till the skin is\r\nflayed off his bones, and he is near the point of expiring; then they\r\napply a most tormenting mixture of vinegar and salt, and consign him to\r\nthat most intolerable hospital where thousands under their cruelties\r\nhave expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Martyrdom of John Calas._\r\n\r\nWe pass over many other individual martyrdoms to insert that of John\r\nCalas, which took place so lately as 1761, and is an indubitable proof\r\nof the bigotry of popery, and shows that neither experience nor\r\nimprovement can root out the inveterate prejudices of the Roman\r\ncatholics, or render them less cruel or inexorable to protestants.\r\n\r\nJohn Calas was a merchant of the city of Thoulouse, where he had been\r\nsettled, and lived in good repute, and had married an English woman of\r\nFrench extraction. Calas and his wife were protestants, and had five\r\nsons, whom they educated in the same religion; but Lewis, one of the\r\nsons, became a Roman catholic, having been converted by a maid-servant,\r\nwho had lived in the family about thirty years. The father, however, did\r\nnot express any resentment or ill-will upon the occasion, but kept the\r\nmaid in the family and settled an annuity upon the son. In October,\r\n1761, the family consisted of John Calas and his wife, one woman\r\nservant, Mark Antony Calas, the eldest son, and Peter Calas, the second\r\nson. Mark Antony was bred to the law, but could not be admitted to\r\npractise, on account of his being a protestant; hence he grew\r\nmelancholy, read all the books he could procure relative to suicide, and\r\nseemed determined to destroy himself. To this may be added, that he led\r\na dissipated life, was greatly addicted to gaming, and did all which\r\ncould constitute the character of a libertine; on which account his\r\nfather frequently reprehended him and sometimes in terms of severity,\r\nwhich considerably added to the doom that seemed to oppress him.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of October, 1761, Mr. Gober la Vaisse, a young gentleman\r\nabout 19 years of age, the son of La Vaisse, a celebrated advocate of\r\nThoulouse, about five o'clock in the evening, was met by John Calas, the\r\nfather, and the eldest son Mark Antony, who was his friend. Calas, the\r\nfather, invited him to supper, and the family and their guest sat down\r\nin a room up one pair of stairs; the whole company, consisting of Calas\r\nthe father and his wife, Antony and Peter Calas, the sons, and La Vaisse\r\nthe guest, no other person being in the house, except the maid-servant\r\nwho has been already mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt was now about seven o'clock; the super was not long; but before it\r\nwas over, Antony left the table, and went into the kitchen, which was on\r\nthe same floor, as he was accustomed to do. The maid asked him if he was\r\ncold? He answered, \"Quite the contrary, I burn;\" and then left her. In\r\nthe mean time his friend and family left the room they had supped in,\r\nand went into a bed-chamber; the father and La Vaisse sat down together\r\non a sofa; the younger son Peter in an elbow chair; and the mother in\r\nanother chair; and, without making any inquiry after Antony, continued\r\nin conversation together till between nine and ten o'clock, when La\r\nVaisse took his leave, and Peter, who had fallen asleep, was awakened to\r\nattend him with a light.\r\n\r\nOn the ground floor of Calas's house was a shop and a ware-house, the\r\nlatter of which was divided from the shop by a pair of folding-doors.\r\nWhen Peter Calas and La Vaisse came down stairs into the shop, they were\r\nextremely shocked to see Antony hanging in his shirt, from a bar which\r\nhe had laid across the top of the two folding-doors, having half opened\r\nthem for that purpose. On discovery of this horrid spectacle, they\r\nshrieked out, which brought down Calas the father, the mother being\r\nseized with such terror as kept her trembling in the passage above. When\r\nthe maid discovered what had happened, she continued below, either\r\nbecause she feared to carry an account of it to her mistress, or because\r\nshe busied herself in doing some good office to her master, who was\r\nembracing the body of his son, and bathing it in his tears. The mother,\r\ntherefore, being thus left alone, went down and mixed in the scene that\r\nhas been already described, with such emotions as it must naturally\r\nproduce. In the mean time Peter had been sent for La Moire, a surgeon in\r\nthe neighbourhood. La Moire was not at home, but his apprentice, Mr.\r\nGrosle, came instantly. Upon examination, he found the body quite dead;\r\nand by this time a papistical crowd of people were gathered about the\r\nhouse, and, having by some means heard that Antony Calas was suddenly\r\ndead, and that the surgeon who had examined the body, declared that he\r\nhad been strangled, they took it into their heads he had been murdered;\r\nand as the family was protestant, they presently supposed that the young\r\nman was about to change his religion, and had been put to death for that\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThe poor father, overwhelmed with grief for the loss of his child, was\r\nadvised by his friends to send for the officers of justice to prevent\r\nhis being torn to pieces by the catholic multitude, who supposed he had\r\nmurdered his son. This was accordingly done, and David, the chief\r\nmagistrate, or capitoul, took the father, Peter the son, the mother, La\r\nVaisse, and the maid, all into custody, and set a guard over them. He\r\nsent for M. de la Tour, a physician, and MM. la Marque and Perronet,\r\nsurgeons, who examined the body for marks of violence, but found none\r\nexcept the mark of the ligature on the neck; they found also the hair of\r\nthe deceased done up in the usual manner, perfectly smooth, and without\r\nthe least disorder; his clothes were also regularly folded up, and laid\r\nupon the counter, nor was his shirt either torn or unbuttoned.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these innocent appearances, the capitoul thought proper\r\nto agree with the opinion of the mob, and took it into his head that old\r\nCalas had sent for La Vaisse, telling him that he had a son to be\r\nhanged; that La Vaisse had come to perform the office of executioner:\r\nand that he had received assistance from the father and brother.\r\n\r\nAs no proof of the supposed fact could be procured, the capitoul had\r\nrecourse to a monitory, or general information, in which the crime was\r\ntaken for granted, and persons were required to give such testimony\r\nagainst it as they were able. This recites, that La Vaisse was\r\ncommissioned by the protestants to be their executioner in ordinary,\r\nwhen any of their children were to be hanged for changing their\r\nreligion; it recites also, that, when the protestants thus hang their\r\nchildren, they compel them to kneel, and one of the interrogatories was\r\nwhether any person had seen Antony Calas kneel before his father when he\r\nstrangled him; it recites likewise, that Antony died a Roman catholic,\r\nand requires evidence of his catholicism.\r\n\r\nBut before this monitory was published, the mob had got a notion that\r\nAntony Calas was the next day to have entered into the fraternity of the\r\nWhite Penitents. The capitoul therefore caused his body to be buried in\r\nthe middle of St. Stephen's church. A few days after the interment of\r\nthe deceased, the White Penitents performed a solemn service for him in\r\ntheir chapel; the church was hung with white, and a tomb was raised in\r\nthe middle of it, on the top of which was placed a human skeleton,\r\nholding in one hand a paper, on which was written, \"Abjuration of\r\nheresy,\" and in the other a palm, the emblem of martyrdom. The next day\r\nthe Franciscans performed a service of the same kind for him.\r\n\r\nThe capitoul continued the persecution with unrelenting severity, and,\r\nwithout the least proof coming in, thought fit to condemn the unhappy\r\nfather, mother, brother, friend, and servant, to the torture, and put\r\nthem all into irons on the 18th of November.\r\n\r\nFrom these dreadful proceedings the sufferers appealed to the\r\nparliament, which immediately took cognizance of the affair, and\r\nannulled the sentence of the capitoul as irregular, but they continued\r\nthe prosecution, and, upon the hangman deposing it was impossible Antony\r\nshould hang himself as was pretended, the majority of the parliament\r\nwere of the opinion, that the prisoners were guilty, and therefore\r\nordered them to be tried by the criminal court of Thoulouse. One voted\r\nhim innocent, but after long debates the majority was for the torture\r\nand wheel, and probably condemned the father by way of experiment,\r\nwhether he was guilty or not, hoping he would, in the agony, confess the\r\ncrime, and accuse the other prisoners, whose fate therefore, they\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nPoor Calas, however, an old man of 68, was condemned to this dreadful\r\npunishment alone. He suffered the torture with great constancy, and was\r\nled to execution in a frame of mind which excited the admiration of all\r\nthat saw him, and particularly of the two Dominicans (father Bourges and\r\nfather Coldagues) who attended him in his last moments, and declared\r\nthat they thought him not only innocent of the crime laid to his charge,\r\nbut an exemplary instance of true christian patience, fortitude, and\r\ncharity. When he saw the executioner prepared to give him the last\r\nstroke, he made a fresh declaration to father Bourges, but while the\r\nwords were still in his mouth, the capitoul, the author of this\r\ncatastrophe, and who came upon the scaffold merely to gratify his desire\r\nof being a witness of his punishment and death, ran up to him, and\r\nbawled out, \"Wretch, there are the fagots which are to reduce your body\r\nto ashes! speak the truth.\" M. Calas made no reply, but turned his head\r\na little aside, and that moment the executioner did his office.\r\n\r\nThe popular outcry against this family was so violent in Languedoc, that\r\nevery body expected to see the children of Calas broke upon the wheel,\r\nand the mother burnt alive.\r\n\r\nYoung Donat Calas was advised to fly into Switzerland: he went, and\r\nfound a gentleman who, at first, could only pity and relieve him,\r\nwithout daring to judge of the rigour exercised against the father,\r\nmother, and brothers. Soon after, one of the brothers, who was only\r\nbanished, likewise threw himself into the arms of the same person, who,\r\nfor more than a month, took every possible precaution to be assured of\r\nthe innocence of the family. Once convinced, he thought himself obliged,\r\nin conscience, to employ his friends, his purse, his pen, and his\r\ncredit, to repair the fatal mistake of the seven judges of Thoulouse,\r\nand to have the proceedings revised by the king's council. This revision\r\nlasted three years, and it is well known what honour Messrs. de Grosne\r\nand Bacquancourt acquired by investigating this memorable cause. Fifty\r\nmasters of the Court of Requests unanimously declared the whole family\r\nof Calas innocent, and recommended them to the benevolent justice of his\r\nmajesty. The duke de Choiseul, who never let slip an opportunity of\r\nsignalizing the greatness of his character, not only assisted this\r\nunfortunate family with money, but obtained for them a gratuity of\r\n36,000 livres from the king.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of March, 1765, the arret was signed which justified the\r\nfamily of Calas, and changed their fate. The ninth of March, 1762, was\r\nthe very day on which the innocent and virtuous father of that family\r\nhad been executed. All Paris ran in crowds to see them come out of\r\nprison, and clapped their hands for joy while the tears streamed from\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\nThis dreadful example of bigotry employed the pen of Voltaire in\r\ndeprecation of the horrors of superstition; and though an infidel\r\nhimself, his essay on toleration does honour to his pen, and has been a\r\nblessed means of abating the rigour of persecution in most European\r\nstates. Gospel purity will equally shun superstition and cruelty, as the\r\nmildness of Christ's tenets teaches only to comfort in this world, and\r\nto procure salvation in the next. To persecute for being of a different\r\nopinion, is as absurd as to persecute for having a different\r\ncountenance: if we honour God, keep sacred the pure doctrines of Christ,\r\nput a full confidence in the promises contained in the holy scriptures,\r\nand obey the political laws of the state in which we reside, we have an\r\nundoubted right to protection instead of persecution, and to serve\r\nheaven as our consciences, regulated by the gospel rules, may direct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE INQUISITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the reformed religion began to diffuse the gospel light throughout\r\nchurch. He accordingly instituted a number of inquisitors, or persons\r\nwho were to make inquiry after, apprehend, and punish, heretics, as the\r\nreformed were called by the papists.\r\n\r\nAt the head of these inquisitors was one Dominic, who had been canonized\r\nby the pope, in order to render his authority the more respectable.\r\nDominic, and the other inquisitors, spread themselves into various Roman\r\ncatholic countries, and treated the protestants with the utmost\r\nseverity. In process of time, the pope, not finding these roving\r\ninquisitors so useful as he had imagined, resolved upon the\r\nestablishment of fixed and regular courts of inquisition. After the\r\norder for these regular courts, the first office of inquisition was\r\nestablished in the city of Thoulouse, and Dominic became the first\r\nregular inquisitor, as he had before been the first roving inquisitor.\r\n\r\nCourts of inquisition were now erected in several countries; but the\r\nSpanish inquisition became the most powerful, and the most dreaded of\r\nany. Even the kings of Spain themselves, though arbitrary in all other\r\nrespects, were taught to dread the power of the lords of the\r\ninquisition; and the horrid cruelties they exercised compelled\r\nmultitudes, who differed in opinion from the Roman catholics, carefully\r\nto conceal their sentiments.\r\n\r\nThe most zealous of all the popish monks, and those who most implicitly\r\nobeyed the church of Rome, were the Dominicans and Franciscans: these,\r\ntherefore, the pope thought proper to invest with an exclusive right of\r\npresiding over the different court of inquisition, and gave them the\r\nmost unlimited powers, as judges delegated by him, and immediately\r\nrepresenting his person: they were permitted to excommunicate, or\r\nsentence to death whom they thought proper, upon the most slight\r\ninformation of heresy. They were allowed to publish crusades against all\r\nwhom they deemed heretics, and enter into leagues with sovereign\r\nprinces, to join their crusades with their forces.\r\n\r\nIn 1244, their power was farther increased by the emperor Frederic the\r\nSecond, who declared himself the protector and friend of all the\r\ninquisitors, and published the cruel edicts, viz. 1. That all heretics\r\nwho continued obstinate, should be burnt. 2. That all heretics who\r\nrepented, should be imprisoned for life.\r\n\r\nThis zeal in the emperor, for the inquisitors of the Roman catholic\r\npersuasion, arose from a report which had been propagated throughout\r\nEurope, that he intended to renounce christianity, and turn Mahometan;\r\nthe emperor therefore, attempted, by the height of bigotry to contradict\r\nthe report, and to show his attachment to popery by cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the inquisition are three inquisitors, or judges, a\r\nfiscal proctor, two secretaries, a magistrate, a messenger, a receiver,\r\na jailer, an agent of confiscated possessions; several assessors,\r\ncounsellors, executioners, physicians, surgeons, door-keepers,\r\nfamiliars, and visiters, who are sworn to secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe principal accusation against those who are subject to this tribunal\r\nis heresy, which comprises all that is spoken, or written, against any\r\nof the articles of the creed, or the traditions of the Roman church. The\r\ninquisition likewise takes cognizance of such as are accused of being\r\nmagicians, and of such who read the bible in the common language, the\r\nTalmud of the Jews, or the Alcoran of the Mahometans.\r\n\r\nUpon all occasions the inquisitors carry on their processes with the\r\nutmost severity, and punish those who offend them with the most\r\nunparalleled cruelty. A protestant has seldom any mercy shown him, and a\r\nJew, who turns christian, is far from being secure.\r\n\r\nA defence in the inquisition is of little use to the prisoner, for a\r\nsuspicion only is deemed sufficient cause of condemnation, and the\r\ngreater his wealth the greater his danger. The principal part of the\r\ninquisitors' cruelties is owing to their rapacity: they destroy the life\r\nto possess the property; and, under the pretence of zeal, plunder each\r\nobnoxious individual.\r\n\r\nA prisoner in the inquisition is never allowed to see the face of his\r\naccuser, or of the witnesses against him, but every method is taken by\r\nthreats and tortures, to oblige him to accuse himself, and by that means\r\ncorroborate their evidence. If the jurisdiction of the inquisition is\r\nnot fully allowed, vengeance is denounced against such as call it in\r\nquestion for if any of its officers are opposed, those who oppose them\r\nare almost certain to be sufferers for their temerity; the maxim of the\r\ninquisition being to strike terror, and awe those who are the objects of\r\nits power into obedience. High birth, distinguished rank, great dignity,\r\nor eminent employments, are no protection from its severities; and the\r\nlowest officers of the inquisition can make the highest characters\r\ntremble.\r\n\r\nWhen the person impeached is condemned, he is either severely whipped,\r\nviolently tortured, sent to the galleys, or sentenced to death; and in\r\neither case the effects are confiscated. After judgment, a procession is\r\nperformed to the place of execution, which ceremony is called an AUTO DE\r\nFE, or act of faith.\r\n\r\nThe following is an account of an auto de fe, performed at Madrid in the\r\nyear 1682.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the inquisition, preceded by trumpets, kettle-drums, and\r\ntheir banner, marched on the 30th of May, in cavalcade, to the palace of\r\nthe great square, where they declared by proclamation, that, on the 30th\r\nof June, the sentence of the prisoners would be put in execution.\r\n\r\nOf these prisoners, twenty men and women, with one renegade Mahometan,\r\nwere ordered to be burned; fifty Jews and Jewesses, having never before\r\nbeen imprisoned, and repenting of their crimes were sentenced to a long\r\nconfinement, and to wear a yellow cap. The whole court of Spain was\r\npresent on this occasion. The grand inquisitor's chair was placed in a\r\nsort of tribunal far above that of the king.\r\n\r\nAmong those who were to suffer, was a young Jewess of exquisite beauty,\r\nand but seventeen years of age. Being on the same side of the scaffold\r\nwhere the queen was seated, she addressed her, in hopes of obtaining a\r\npardon, in the following pathetic speech: \"Great queen, will not your\r\nroyal presence be of some service to the in my miserable condition! Have\r\nregard to my youth; and, oh! consider, that I am about to die for\r\nprofessing a religion imbibed from my earliest infancy!\" Her majesty\r\nseemed greatly to pity her distress, but turned away her eyes, as she\r\ndid not dare to speak a word in behalf of a person who had been declared\r\na heretic.\r\n\r\nNow mass began, in the midst of which the priest came from the altar,\r\nplaced himself near the scaffold, and seated himself in a chair prepared\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe chief inquisitor then descended from the amphitheatre, dressed in\r\nhis cope, and having a mitre on his head. After having bowed to the\r\naltar, he advanced towards the king's balcony, and went up to it,\r\nattended by some of his officers, carrying a cross and the gospels, with\r\na book containing the oath by which the kings of Spain oblige themselves\r\nto protect the catholic faith, to extirpate heretics, and to support\r\nwith all their power and force the prosecutions and decrees of the\r\ninquisition: a like oath was administered to the counsellors and whole\r\nassembly. The mass was begun about twelve at noon, and did not end till\r\nnine in the evening, being protracted by a proclamation of the sentences\r\nof the several criminals, which were already separately rehearsed aloud\r\none after the other.\r\n\r\nAfter this, followed the burning of the twenty-one men and women, whose\r\nintrepidity in suffering that horrid death was truly astonishing. The\r\nking's near situation to the criminals rendered their dying groans very\r\naudible to him; he could not, however, be absent from this dreadful\r\nscene, as it is esteemed a religious one; and his coronation oath\r\nobliges him to give a sanction by his presence to all the acts of the\r\ntribunal.\r\n\r\nWhat we have already said may be applied to inquisitions in general, as\r\nwell as to that of Spain in particular. The inquisition belonging to\r\nPortugal is exactly upon a similar plan to that of Spain, having been\r\ninstituted much about the same time, and put under the same regulations.\r\nThe inquisitors allow the torture to be used only three times, but\r\nduring those times it is so severely inflicted, that the prisoner either\r\ndies under it, or continues always after a cripple, and suffers the\r\nseverest pains upon every change of weather. We shall give an ample\r\ndescription of the severe torments occasioned by the torture, from the\r\naccount of one who suffered it the three respective times, but happily\r\nsurvived the cruelties he underwent.\r\n\r\nAt the first time of torturing, six executioners entered, stripped him\r\nnaked to his drawers, and laid him upon his back on a kind of stand,\r\nelevated a few feet from the floor. The operation commenced by putting\r\nan iron collar round his neck, and a ring to each foot, which fastened\r\nhim to the stand. His limbs being thus stretched out, they wound two\r\nropes round each thigh; which ropes being passed under the scaffold,\r\nthrough holes made for that purpose, were all drawn tight at the same\r\ninstant of time, by four of the men, on a given signal.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive that the pains which immediately succeeded were\r\nintolerable; the ropes, which were of a small size, cut through the\r\nprisoner's flesh to the bone, making the blood to gush out at eight\r\ndifferent places thus bound at a time. As the prisoner persisted in not\r\nmaking any confession of what the inquisitors required, the ropes were\r\ndrawn in this manner four times successively.\r\n\r\nThe manner of inflicting the second torture was as follows: they forced\r\nhis arms backwards so that the palms of his hands were turned outward\r\nbehind him; when, by means of a rope that fastened them together at the\r\nwrists, and which was turned by an engine, they drew them by degrees\r\nnearer each other, in such a manner that the back of each hand touched,\r\nand stood exactly parallel to each other. In consequence of this violent\r\ncontortion, both his shoulders became dislocated, and a considerable\r\nquantity of blood issued from his mouth. This torture was repeated\r\nthrice; after which he was again taken to the dungeon, and the surgeon\r\nset the dislocated bones.\r\n\r\nTwo months after the second torture, the prisoner being a little\r\nrecovered, was again ordered to the torture-room, and there, for the\r\nlast time, made to undergo another kind of punishment, which was\r\ninflicted twice without any intermission. The executioners fastened a\r\nthick iron chain round his body, which crossing at the breast,\r\nterminated at the wrists. They then placed him with his back against a\r\nthick board, at each extremity whereof was a pulley, through which there\r\nran a rope that caught the end of the chain at his wrists. The\r\nexecutioner then, stretching the end of this rope by means of a roller,\r\nplaced at a distance behind him, pressed or bruised his stomach in\r\nproportion as the ends of the chains were drawn tighter. They tortured\r\nhim in this manner to such a degree, that his wrists, as well as his\r\nshoulders, were quite dislocated. They were, however, soon set by the\r\nsurgeons; but the barbarians, not yet satisfied with this species of\r\ncruelty, made him immediately undergo the like torture a second time,\r\nwhich he sustained (though, if possible, attended with keener pains,)\r\nwith equal constancy and resolution. After this, he was again remanded\r\nto his dungeon, attended by the surgeon to dress his bruises and adjust\r\nthe part dislocated, and here he continued till their Auto de Fe, or\r\njail delivery, when he was discharged, crippled and diseased for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An account of the cruel Handling and Burning of Nicholas Burton, an\r\nEnglish Merchant, in Spain._\r\n\r\nThe fifth day of November, about the year of our Lord 1560, Mr. Nicholas\r\nBurton, citizen sometime of London, and merchant, dwelling in the parish\r\nof Little St. Bartholomew, peaceably and quietly following his traffic in\r\nthe trade of merchandize, and being in the city of Cadiz, in the party\r\nof Andalusia, in Spain, there came into his lodging a Judas, or, as they\r\nterm them, a familiar of the fathers of the inquisition; who asking for\r\nthe said Nicholas Burton, feigned that he had a letter to deliver into\r\nhis own hands; by which means he spake with him immediately. And having\r\nno letter to deliver to him, then the said promoter, or familiar, at the\r\nmotion of the devil his master, whose messenger he was, invented another\r\nlie, and said, that he would take lading for London in such ships as the\r\nsaid Nicholas Burton had freighted to lade, if he would let any; which\r\nwas partly to know where he loaded his goods, that they might attach\r\nthem, and chiefly to protract the time until the sergeant of the\r\ninquisition might come and apprehend the body of the said Nicholas\r\nBurton; which they did incontinently.\r\n\r\nHe then well perceiving that they were not able to burden or charge him\r\nthat he had written, spoke, or done any thing there in that country\r\nagainst the ecclesiastical or temporal laws of the same realm, boldly\r\nasked them what they had to lay to his charge that they did so arrest\r\nhim, and bade them to declare the cause, and he would answer them.\r\nNotwithstanding they answered nothing, but commanded him with\r\nthreatening words to hold his peace, and not speak one word to them.\r\n\r\nAnd so they carried him to the filthy common prison of the town of\r\nCadiz, where he remained in irons fourteen days amongst thieves.\r\n\r\nAll which time he so instructed the poor prisoners in the word of God,\r\naccording to the good talent which God had given him in that behalf, and\r\nalso in the Spanish tongue to utter the same, that in that short space\r\nhe had well reclaimed several of those superstitious and ignorant\r\nSpaniards to embrace the word of God, and to reject their popish\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nWhich being known unto the officers of the inquisition, they conveyed\r\nhim laden with irons from thence to a city called Seville, into a more\r\ncruel and straiter prison called Triana, where the said fathers of the\r\ninquisition proceeded against him secretly according to their\r\naccustomable cruel tyranny, that never after he could be suffered to\r\nwrite or speak to any of his nation: so that to this day it is unknown\r\nwho was his accuser.\r\n\r\nAfterward, the 20th of December, they brought the said Nicholas Burton,\r\nwith a great number of other prisoners, for professing the true\r\nChristian religion, into the city of Seville, to a place where the said\r\ninquisitors sat in judgment which they called Auto, with a canvass coat,\r\nwhereupon in divers parts was painted the figure of a huge devil,\r\ntormenting a soul in a flame of fire, and on his head a copping tank of\r\nthe same work.\r\n\r\nHis tongue was forced out of his mouth with a cloven stick fastened upon\r\nit, that he should not utter his conscience and faith to the people, and\r\nso he was set with another Englishman of Southampton, and divers other\r\ncondemned men for religion, as well Frenchmen as Spaniards, upon a\r\nscaffold over against the said inquisition, where their sentences and\r\njudgments were read and pronounced against them.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately after the said sentences given, they were carried from\r\nthence to the place of execution without the city, where they most\r\ncruelly burned them, for whose constant faith, God be praised.\r\n\r\nThis Nicholas Burton by the way, and in the flames of fire, had so\r\ncheerful a countenance, embracing death with all patience and gladness,\r\nthat the tormentors and enemies which stood by, said, that the devil had\r\nhis soul before he came to the fire; and therefore they said his senses\r\nof feeling were past him.\r\n\r\nIt happened that after the arrest of Nicholas Burton aforesaid,\r\nimmediately all the goods and merchandize which he brought with him into\r\nSpain by the way of traffic, were (according to their common usage)\r\nseized, and taken into the sequester; among which they also rolled up\r\nmuch that appertained to another English merchant, wherewith he was\r\ncredited as factor. Whereof so soon as news was brought to the merchant\r\nas well of the imprisonment of his factor, as of the arrest made upon\r\nhis goods, he sent his attorney into Spain, with authority from him to\r\nmake claim to his goods, and to demand them; whose name was John\r\nFronton, citizen of Bristol.\r\n\r\nWhen his attorney was landed at Seville, and had shown all his letters\r\nand writings to the holy house, requiring them that such goods might be\r\ndelivered into his possession, answer was made to him that he must sue\r\nby bill, and retain an advocate (but all was doubtless to delay him,)\r\nand they forsooth of courtesy assigned him one to frame his supplication\r\nfor him, and other such bills of petition, as he had to exhibit into\r\ntheir holy court, demanding for each bill eight rials, albeit they stood\r\nhim in no more stead than if he had put up none at all. And for the\r\nspace of three or four months this fellow missed not twice a day\r\nattending every morning and afternoon at the inquisitors' palace, suing\r\nunto them upon his knees for his despatch, but especially to the bishop\r\nof Tarracon, who was at that very time chief in the inquisition at\r\nSeville, that he of his absolute authority would command restitution to\r\nbe made thereof; but the booty was so good and great, that it was very\r\nhard to come by it again.\r\n\r\nAt length, after he had spent four whole months in suits and requests,\r\nand also to no purpose, he received this answer from them, That he must\r\nshow better evidence, and bring more sufficient certificates out of\r\nEngland for proof of this matter, than those which he had already\r\npresented to the court. Whereupon the party forthwith posted to London,\r\nand with all speed returned to Seville again with more ample and large\r\nletters testimonial, and certificates, according to their requests, and\r\nexhibited them to the court.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the inquisitors still shifted him off, excusing\r\nthemselves by lack of leisure, and for that they were occupied in more\r\nweighty affairs, and with such answers put him off, four months after.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the party had well nigh spent all his money, and therefore\r\nsued the more earnestly for his despatch, they referred the matter\r\nwholly to the bishop. Of whom, when he repaired unto him, he made this\r\nanswer, That for himself, he knew what he had to do, howbeit he was but\r\none man, and the determination appertained to the other commissioners as\r\nwell as unto him; and thus by posting and passing it from one to\r\nanother, the party could obtain no end of his suit. Yet for his\r\nimportunity's sake, they were resolved to despatch him: it was on this\r\nsort: one of the inquisitors, called Gasco, a man very well experienced\r\nin these practices, willed the party to resort unto him after dinner.\r\n\r\nThe fellow being glad to hear this news, and supposing that his goods\r\nshould be restored unto him, and that he was called in for that purpose\r\nto talk with the other that was in prison to confer with him about their\r\naccounts, rather through a little misunderstanding, hearing the\r\ninquisitors cast out a word, that it should be needful for him to talk\r\nwith the prisoner, and being thereupon more than half persuaded, that at\r\nlength they meant good faith, did so, and repaired thither about the\r\nevening. Immediately upon his coming, the jailer was forthwith charged\r\nwith him, to shut him up close in such a prison where they appointed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe party, hoping at the first that he had been called for about some\r\nother matter, and seeing himself, contrary to his expectation, cast into\r\na dark dungeon, perceived at length that the world went with him far\r\notherwise than he supposed it would have done.\r\n\r\nBut within two or three days after, he was brought into the court where\r\nhe began to demand his goods: and because it was a device that well\r\nserved their turn without any more circumstance, they bid him say his\r\nAve Maria; \"Ave Maria gratia plena, Dominus tecum, benedicta tu in\r\nmulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui Jesus. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThe same was written word by word as he spake it, and without any more\r\ntalk of claiming his goods, because it was needless, they commanded him\r\nto prison again, and entered an action against him as a heretic,\r\nforasmuch as he did not say his Ave Maria after the Romish fashion, but\r\nended it very suspiciously, for he should have added moreover; \"Sancta\r\nMaria mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus:\" by abbreviating whereof,\r\nit was evident enough (said they) that he did not allow the mediation of\r\nsaints.\r\n\r\nThus they picked a quarrel to detain him in prison a longer season, and\r\nafterward brought him forth upon their stage disguised after their\r\nmanner; where sentence was given, that he should lose all the goods\r\nwhich he sued for, though they were not his own, and besides this,\r\nsuffer a year's imprisonment.\r\n\r\nMark Brughes, an Englishman, master of an English ship called the\r\nMinion, was burnt in a city in Portugal.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hoker, a young man about the age of sixteen years, being an\r\nEnglishman, was stoned to death by certain young men in the city of\r\nSeville, for the same righteous cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some private Enormities of the inquisition laid open, by a very\r\nsingular occurrence._\r\n\r\nWhen the crown of Spain was contested for in the beginning of the\r\npresent century, by two princes, who equally pretended to the\r\nsovereignty, France espoused the cause of one competitor, and England of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Berwick, a natural son of James II. who abdicated England,\r\ncommanded the Spanish and French forces, and defeated the English at the\r\ncelebrated battle of Almanza. The army was then divided into two parts;\r\nthe one consisting of Spaniards and French, headed by the duke of\r\nBerwick, advanced towards Catalonia; the other body, consisting of\r\nFrench troops only, commanded by the duke of Orleans, proceeded to the\r\nconquest of Arragon.\r\n\r\nAs the troops drew near to the city of Arragon, the magistrates came to\r\noffer the keys to the duke of Orleans; but he told them, haughtily, they\r\nwere rebels, and that he would not accept the keys, for he had orders to\r\nenter the city through a breach.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly made a breach in the walls with his cannon, and then\r\nentered the city through it, together with his whole army.--When he had\r\nmade every necessary regulation here, he departed to subdue other\r\nplaces, leaving a strong garrison at once to overawe and defend, under\r\nthe command of his lieutenant-general M. de Legal. This gentleman,\r\nthough brought up a Roman catholic, was totally free from superstition:\r\nhe united great talents with great bravery: and was, at once, the\r\nskilful officer, and accomplished gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe duke, before his departure, had ordered that heavy contributions\r\nshould be levied upon the city to the following manner:\r\n\r\n1. That the magistrates and principal inhabitants should pay a thousand\r\ncrowns per month for the duke's table.\r\n\r\n2. That every house should pay one pistole, which would monthly amount\r\nto 18,000 pistoles.\r\n\r\n3. That every convent and monastery should pay a donative,\r\nproportionable to its riches and rents.\r\n\r\nThe two last contributions to be appropriated to the maintenance of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThe money levied upon the magistrates and principal inhabitants, and\r\nupon every house, was paid as soon as demanded; but when the proper\r\npersons applied to the heads of convents and monasteries, they found\r\nthat the ecclesiastics were not so willing, as other people, to part\r\nwith their cash.\r\n\r\nOf the donatives to be raised by the clergy:\r\n\r\n        The college of Jesuits to pay     2000 pistoles\r\n                       Carmelites,        1000\r\n                       Augustins,         1000\r\n                       Dominicans         1000\r\n\r\nM. de Legal sent to the Jesuits a peremptory order to pay the money\r\nimmediately. The superior of the Jesuits returned for answer, that for\r\nthe clergy to pay money for the army was against all ecclesiastical\r\nimmunities; and that he knew of no argument which could authorize such a\r\nprocedure. M. de Legal then sent four companies of dragoons to quarter\r\nthemselves in the college, with this sarcastic message, \"To convince you\r\nof the necessity of paying the money, I have sent four substantial\r\narguments to your college, drawn from the system of military logic; and,\r\ntherefore, hope you will not need any further admonition to direct your\r\nconduct.\"\r\n\r\nThese proceedings greatly perplexed the Jesuits, who despatched an\r\nexpress to court to the king's confessor, who was of their order; but\r\nthe dragoons were much more expeditious in plundering and doing\r\nmischief, than the courier in his journey: so that the Jesuits, seeing\r\nevery thing going to wreck and ruin, thought proper to adjust the matter\r\namicably, and paid the money before the return of their messenger. The\r\nAugustins and Carmelites, taking warning by what had happened to the\r\nJesuits, prudently went and paid the money, and by that means escaped\r\nthe study of military arguments, and of being taught logic by dragoons.\r\n\r\nBut the Dominicans, who were all familiars of, or agents dependent on,\r\nthe inquisition, imagined, that that very circumstance would be their\r\nprotection; but they were mistaken, for M. de Legal neither feared nor\r\nrespected the inquisition. The chief of the Dominicans sent word to the\r\nmilitary commander that his order was poor, and had not any money\r\nwhatever to pay the donative; for, says he, the whole wealth of the\r\nDominicans consists only in the silver images of the apostles and\r\nsaints, as large as life, which are placed in our church, and which it\r\nwould be sacrilege to remove.\r\n\r\nThis insinuation was meant to terrify the French commander, whom the\r\ninquisitors imagined would not dare to be so profane as to wish for the\r\npossession of the precious idols.\r\n\r\nHe, however, sent word that the silver images would make admirable\r\nsubstitutes for money, and would be more in character in his possession,\r\nthan in that of the Dominicans themselves, \"For, (said he) while you\r\npossess them in the manner you do at present, they stand up in niches,\r\nuseless and motionless, without being of the least benefit to mankind in\r\ngeneral, or even to yourselves; but, when they come into my possession,\r\nthey shall be useful; I will put them in motion; for I intend to have\r\nthem coined, when they may travel like the apostles, be beneficial in\r\nvarious places, and circulate for the universal service of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe inquisitors were astonished at this treatment, which they never\r\nexpected to receive, even from crowned heads; they therefore determined\r\nto deliver their precious images in a solemn procession, that they might\r\nexcite the people to an insurrection. The Dominican friars were\r\naccordingly ordered to march to De Legal's house, with the silver\r\napostles and saints, in a mournful manner, having lighted tapers with\r\nthem, and bitterly crying all the way, heresy, heresy.\r\n\r\nM. de Legal, hearing these proceedings, ordered four companies of\r\ngrenadiers to line the street which led to his house; each grenadier was\r\nordered to have his loaded fuzee in one hand, and a lighted taper in the\r\nother; so that the troops might either repel force with force, or do\r\nhonour to the farcical solemnity.\r\n\r\nThe friars did all they could to raise the tumult, but the common people\r\nwere too much afraid of the troops under arms to obey them, the silver\r\nimages were, therefore, of necessity delivered up to M. de Legal, who\r\nsent them to the mint, and ordered them to be coined immediately.\r\n\r\nThe project of raising an insurrection having failed, the inquisitors\r\ndetermined to excommunicate M. de Legal, unless he would release their\r\nprecious silver saints from imprisonment in the mint, before they were\r\nmelted down, or otherwise mutilated. The French commander absolutely\r\nrefused to release the images, but said they should certainly travel and\r\ndo good; upon which the inquisitors drew up the form of excommunication,\r\nand ordered their secretary to go and read it to M. De Legal.\r\n\r\nThe secretary punctually performed his commission, and read the\r\nexcommunication deliberately and distinctly. The French commander heard\r\nit with great patience, and politely told the secretary he would answer\r\nit the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen the secretary of the inquisition was gone, M. De Legal ordered his\r\nown secretary to prepare a form of excommunication, exactly like that\r\nsent by the inquisition; but to make this alteration, instead of his\r\nname to put in those of the inquisitors.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he ordered four regiments under arms, and commanded\r\nthem to accompany his secretary, and act as he directed.\r\n\r\nThe secretary went to the inquisition, and insisted upon admittance,\r\nwhich, after a great deal of altercation, was granted. As soon as he\r\nentered, he read, in an audible voice, the excommunication sent by M. De\r\nLegal against the inquisitors. The inquisitors were all present, and\r\nheard it with astonishment, never having before met with any individual\r\nwho dared behave so boldly. They loudly cried out against De Legal, as a\r\nheretic; and said, this was a most daring insult against the catholic\r\nfaith. But, to surprise them still more, the French secretary told them,\r\nthey must remove from their present lodgings; for the French commander\r\nwanted to quarter the troops in the inquisition, as it was the most\r\ncommodious place in the whole city.\r\n\r\nThe inquisitors exclaimed loudly upon this occasion, when the secretary\r\nput them under a strong guard, and sent them to a place appointed by M.\r\nDe Legal to receive them. The inquisitors, finding how things went,\r\nbegged that they might be permitted to take their private property,\r\nwhich was granted, and they immediately set out for Madrid, where they\r\nmade the most bitter complaints to the king; but the monarch told them,\r\nhe could not grant them any redress, as the injuries they had received\r\nwere from his grandfather, the king of France's troops, by whose\r\nassistance alone he could be firmly established in his kingdom. \"Had it\r\nbeen my own troops, (said he) I would have punished them; but as it is,\r\nI cannot pretend to exert any authority.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, M. De Legal's secretary set open all the doors of the\r\ninquisition, and released the prisoners, who amounted in the whole to\r\n400; and among these were 60 beautiful young women, who appeared to form\r\na seraglio for the three principal inquisitors.\r\n\r\nThis discovery, which laid the enormity of the inquisitors so open,\r\ngreatly alarmed the archbishop, who desired M. De Legal to send the\r\nwomen to his palace, and he would take proper care of them; and at the\r\nsame time he published an ecclesiastical censure against all such as\r\nshould ridicule, or blame, the holy office of the inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe French commander sent word to the archbishop, that the prisoners had\r\neither run away, or were so securely concealed by their friends, or even\r\nby his own officers, that it was impossible for him to send them back\r\nagain; and, therefore, the inquisition having committed such atrocious\r\nactions, must now put up with their exposure.\r\n\r\nOne of the ladies thus happily delivered from captivity, was afterward\r\nmarried to the very French officer who opened the door of her dungeon,\r\nand released her from confinement. The lady related the following\r\ncircumstances to her husband, and to M. Gavin, (author of the Master Key\r\nto Popery) from the latter of whom we have selected the most material\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n\"I went one day (says the lady) with my mother, to visit the countess\r\nAttarass, and I met there Don Francisco Tirregon, her confessor and\r\nsecond inquisitor of the holy office.\r\n\r\nAfter we had drunk chocolate, he asked me my age, my confessor's name,\r\nand many intricate questions about religion. The severity of his\r\ncountenance frightened me, which he perceiving, told the countess to\r\ninform me, that he was not so severe as he looked for. He then caressed\r\nme in a most obliging manner, presented his hand, which I kissed with\r\ngreat reverence and modesty; and, as he went away, he made use of this\r\nremarkable expression. My dear child, I shall remember you till the next\r\ntime. I did not, at the time, mark the sense of the words; for I was\r\ninexperienced in matters of gallantry, being, at that time but fifteen\r\nyears old. Indeed, he unfortunately did remember me, for the very same\r\nnight, when our whole family were in bed, we heard a great knocking at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThe maid, who laid in the same room with me, went to the window, and\r\ninquired who was there. The answer was, THE HOLY INQUISITION. On hearing\r\nthis I screamed out, Father! father! dear father, I am ruined forever!\r\nMy father got up, and came to me to know the occasion of my crying out;\r\nI told him the inquisitors were at the door. On hearing this, instead of\r\nprotecting me, he hurried down stairs as fast as possible; and, lest the\r\nmaid should be too slow, opened the street door himself; under such\r\nabject and slavish fears, are bigoted minds! as soon as he knew they\r\ncame for me, he fetched me with great solemnity, and delivered me to the\r\nofficers with much submission.\r\n\r\nI was hurried into a coach, with no other clothing than a petticoat and\r\na mantle, for they would not let me stay to take any thing else. My\r\nfright was so great, I expected to die that very night; but judge my\r\nsurprise, when I was ushered into an apartment, decorated with all the\r\nelegance that taste, united with opulence, could bestow.\r\n\r\nSoon after the officers left me, a maid servant appeared with a silver\r\nsalver, on which were sweetmeats and cinnamon water. She desired me to\r\ntake some refreshment before I went to bed; I told her I could not, but\r\nshould be glad if she could inform me whether I was to be put to death\r\nthat night or not.\r\n\r\n\"To be put to death! (exclaimed she) you do not come here to be put to\r\ndeath, but to live like a princess, and you shall want for nothing in\r\nthe world, but the liberty of going out; so pray don't be afraid, but go\r\nto bed and sleep easy; for to-morrow you shall see wonders within this\r\nhouse; and as I am chosen to be your waiting-maid, I hope you'll be very\r\nkind to me.\"\r\n\r\nI was going to ask some questions, but she told me she must not answer\r\nany thing more till the next day, but assured me that nobody would come\r\nto disturb me. I am going, she said, about a little business but I will\r\ncome back presently, for my bed is in the closet next yours, so she left\r\nme for about a quarter of an hour, and then returned. She then said,\r\nmadam, pray let me know when you will be pleased have your chocolate\r\nready in the morning.\r\n\r\nThis greatly surprised me, so that without replying to her question, I\r\nasked her name;--she said, my name is Mary. Mary, then, said I, for\r\nheaven's sake, tell me whether I am brought here to die or not?--I have\r\ntold you already, replied she, that you came here to be one of the\r\nhappiest ladies in the world.\r\n\r\nWe went to bed, but the fear of death prevented me from sleeping the\r\nwhole night; Mary waked; she was surprised to find me up, but she soon\r\nrose, and after leaving me for about half an hour, she brought in two\r\ncups of chocolate, and some biscuit on a silver plate.\r\n\r\nI drank one cup of chocolate, and desired her to drink the other, which\r\nshe did: when we had done, I said, well, Mary, can you give me any\r\naccount of the reasons for my being brought here? To which she answered,\r\nnot yet, madam, you must have patience, and immediately slipped out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour after, she brought a great quantity of elegant\r\nclothes, suitable to a lady of the highest rank, and told me, I must\r\ndress myself. Among several trinkets which accompanied the clothes, I\r\nobserved, with surprise, a snuff box, in the lid of which was a picture\r\nof Don Francisco Tirregon. This unravelled to me the mystery of my\r\nconfinement, and at the same time roused my imagination to contrive how\r\nto evade receiving the present. If I absolutely refused it, I thought\r\nimmediate death must ensue; and to accept it, was giving him too much\r\nencouragement against my honour. At length I hit upon a medium, and said\r\nto Mary, pray present my respects to Don Francisco Tirregon, and tell\r\nhim, that, as I could not bring my clothes along with me last night,\r\nmodesty permits me to accept of these garments, which are requisite to\r\nkeep me decent; but since I do not take snuff, I hope his lordship will\r\nexcuse me in not accepting his box.\r\n\r\nMary went with my answer, and soon returned with Don Francisco's\r\nportrait elegantly set in gold, and richly embellished with diamonds.\r\nThis message accompanied it: \"That his lordship had made a mistake, his\r\nintent not being to send me a snuffbox, but his portrait.\" I was at a\r\ngreat loss what to do; when Mary said, pray, madam, take my poor advice;\r\naccept of the portrait, and every thing else that his lordship sends\r\nyou; for if you do not, he can compel you to do what he pleases, and put\r\nyou to death when he thinks proper, without any body being able to\r\ndefend you. But if you are obliging to him, continued she, he will be\r\nvery kind, and you will be as happy as a queen; you will have elegant\r\napartments to live in, beautiful gardens to range in, and agreeable\r\nladies to visit you: therefore, I advise you to send a civil answer, or\r\neven not to deny a visit from his lordship, or perhaps you may repent of\r\nyour disrespect.\r\n\r\nO, my God! exclaimed I, must I sacrifice my honour to my fears, and give\r\nup my virtue to his despotic power? Alas! what can I do? To resist, is\r\nvain. If I oppose his desires, force will obtain what chastity refuses.\r\nI now fell into the greatest agonies, and told Mary to return what\r\nanswer she thought proper.\r\n\r\nShe said she was glad of my humble submission, and ran to acquaint Don\r\nFrancisco with it. In a few minutes she returned, with joy in her\r\ncountenance, telling me his lordship would honour me with his company to\r\nsupper. \"And now give me leave, madam, (said she) to call you mistress,\r\nfor I am to wait upon you. I have been in a holy office fourteen years,\r\nand know all the customs perfectly well; but as silence is imposed upon\r\nme, under pain of death, I can only answer such questions as immediately\r\nrelate to your own person. But I would advise you never to oppose the\r\nholy father's will; or if you see any young ladies about, never ask them\r\nany questions. You may divert yourself sometimes among them, but must\r\nnever tell them any thing: three days hence you will dine with them; and\r\nat all times you may have music, and other recreations. In fine, you\r\nwill be so happy, that you will not wish to go abroad; and when your\r\ntime is expired, the holy fathers will send you out of this country, and\r\nmarry you to some nobleman.\" After saying these words she left me,\r\noverwhelmed with astonishment, and scarce knowing what to think. As soon\r\nas I recovered myself, I began to look about, and finding a closet, I\r\nopened it, and perceived that it was filled with books: they ware\r\nchiefly upon historical and profane subjects, but not any on religious\r\nmatter. I chose out a book of history, and so passed the interval with\r\nsome degree of satisfaction till dinner time.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was served up with the greatest elegance, and consisted of\r\nall that could gratify the most luxurious appetite. When dinner was\r\nover, Mary left me, and told me, if I wanted any thing I might ring a\r\nbell, which she pointed out to me.\r\n\r\nI read a book to amuse myself during the afternoon, and at seven in the\r\nevening, Don Francisco came to visit me in his night-gown and cap, not\r\nwith the gravity of an inquisitor, but with the gayety of a gallant.\r\n\r\nHe saluted me with great respect, and told me, that he came to see me in\r\norder to show the great respect he had for my family, and to inform me\r\nthat it was my lovers who had procured my confinement, having accused me\r\nin matters of religion; and that the informations were taken, and the\r\nsentence pronounced against me, to be burnt in a dry pan, with a gradual\r\nfire; but that he, out of pity and love to my family, had stopped the\r\nexecution of it.\r\n\r\nThese words were like daggers to my heart; I dropped at his feet, and\r\nsaid, \"Ah, my lord! have you stopped the execution for ever?\" He\r\nreplied, \"that belongs to yourself only,\" and abruptly wished me good\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was gone I burst into tears, when Mary came and asked me\r\nwhat could make me cry so bitterly. To which I answered, oh, Mary! what\r\nis the meaning of the dry pan and gradual fire? for I am to die by\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nMadam, said she, never fear, you shall see, ere long, the dry pan and\r\ngradual fire; but they are made for those who oppose the holy father's\r\nwill, not for you who are so good as to obey it. But pray, says she, was\r\nDon Francisco very obliging? I don't know, said I, for he frightened me\r\nout of my wits by his discourse; he saluted me with civility, but left\r\nme abruptly.\r\n\r\nWell, said Mary, you do not yet know his temper, he is extremely\r\nobliging to them that are kind to him; but if they are disobedient he is\r\nunmerciful as Nero; so, for your own sake, take care to oblige him in\r\nall respects: and now, dear madam, pray go to supper, and be easy. I\r\nwent to supper, indeed, and afterward to bed; but I could neither eat\r\nnor sleep, for the thoughts of the dry pan and gradual fire deprived me\r\nof appetite, and banished drowsiness.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Mary said, that as nobody was stirring, if I\r\nwould promise her secrecy, she would show me the dry pan and gradual\r\nfire; so taking me down stairs, she brought me to a large room, with a\r\nthick iron door, which she opened. Within it was an oven, with fire in\r\nit at the time, and a large brass upon it, with a cover of the same, and\r\na lock to it. In the next room there was a great wheel, covered on both\r\nsides with thick boards, opening a little window in the centre, Mary\r\ndesired me to look in with a candle; there I saw all the circumference\r\nof the wheel set with sharp razors, which made me shudder.\r\n\r\nShe then took me to a pit, which was full of venomous animals. On my\r\nexpressing great horror at the sight, she said, \"Now my good mistress,\r\nI'll tell you the use of these things. The dry pan is for heretics, and\r\nthose who oppose the holy father's will and pleasure; they are put alive\r\ninto the pan, being first stripped naked; and the cover being locked\r\ndown, the executioner begins to put a small fire into the oven, and by\r\ndegrees he augments it, till the body is reduced to ashes. The wheel is\r\ndesigned for those who speak against the pope, or the holy fathers of\r\nthe inquisition; for they are put into the machine through the little\r\nwheel, which is locked after them, and then the wheel is turned swiftly,\r\ntill they are cut to pieces. The pit is for those who contemn the\r\nimages, and refuse to give proper respect to ecclesiastical persons; for\r\nthey are thrown into the pit, and so become the food of poisonous\r\nanimals.\"\r\n\r\nWe went back again to my chamber, and Mary said, that another day she\r\nwould show me the torments designed for other transgressors, but I was\r\nin such agonies at what I had seen, that I begged to be terrified with\r\nno more such sights. She soon after left me, but not without enjoining\r\nmy strict obedience to Don Francisco; for if you do not comply with his\r\nwill, said she, the dry pan and gradual fire will be your fate.\r\n\r\nThe horrors which the sight of these things, and Mary's expressions,\r\nimpressed on my mind, almost bereaved me of my senses, and left me in\r\nsuch a state of stupefaction that I seemed to have no manner of will of\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mary said, now let me dress you as nice as possible,\r\nfor you must go and wish Don Francisco good-morrow, and breakfast with\r\nhim. When I was dressed, she conveyed me through a gallery into his\r\napartment, where I found that he was in bed. He ordered Mary to\r\nwithdraw, and to serve up breakfast in about two hours time. When Mary\r\nwas gone, he commanded me to undress myself and come to bed to him. The\r\nmanner in which he spoke, and the dreadful ideas with which my mind was\r\nfilled, so terribly frightened me, that I pulled off my cloths, without\r\nknowing what I did, and stepped into bed, insensible of the indecency I\r\nwas transacting: so totally had the care of self preservation absorbed\r\nall my other thoughts, and so entirely were the ideas of delicacy\r\nobliterated by the force of terror!\r\n\r\nThus, to avoid the dry pan, did I entail upon myself perpetual infamy;\r\nand to escape the so much dreaded gradual fire, give myself up to the\r\nflames of lust. Wretched alternative, where the only choice is an\r\nexcruciating death, or everlasting pollution!\r\n\r\nMary came at the expiration of two hours, and served us with chocolate\r\nin the most submissive manner; for she kneeled down by the bedside to\r\npresent it. When I was dressed, Mary took me into a very delightful\r\napartment, which I had never yet seen. It was furnished with the most\r\ncostly elegance; but what gave me the greatest astonishment was, the\r\nprospect from its windows, of a beautiful garden, and a fine meandering\r\nriver. Mary told me, that the young ladies she had mentioned would come\r\nto pay their compliments to me before dinner, and begged me to remember\r\nher advice in keeping a prudent guard over my tongue.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes a great number of very beautiful young ladies, richly\r\ndressed, entered my room, and successively embracing me, wished me joy.\r\nI was so surprised, that I was unable to answer their compliments: which\r\none of the ladies perceiving, said, \"Madam, the solitude of this place\r\nwill affect you in the beginning, but whenever you begin to feel the\r\npleasures and amusements you may enjoy, you will quit those pensive\r\nthoughts. We, at present, beg the honour of you to dine with us to-day,\r\nand henceforward three days in a week.\" I returned them suitable thanks\r\nin general terms, and so went to dinner, in which the most exquisite and\r\nsavoury dishes, of various kinds, were served up with the most delicate\r\nand pleasant fruits and sweetmeats. The room was long, with two tables\r\non each side, and a third in the front. I reckoned fifty-two young\r\nladies, the eldest not exceeding twenty-four years of age. There were\r\nfive maid-servants besides Mary, to wait upon us; but Mary confined her\r\nattention to me alone. After dinner we retired to a capacious gallery,\r\nwhere they played on musical instruments, a few diverted themselves with\r\ncards, and the rest amused themselves with walking about. Mary, at\r\nlength, entered the gallery, and said, ladies, this is a day of\r\nrecreation, and so you may go into whatever rooms you please till eight\r\no'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nThey unanimously agreed to adjourn to my apartment. Here we found a most\r\nelegant cold collation, of which all the ladies partook, and passed the\r\ntime in innocent conversation and harmless mirth; but none mentioned a\r\nword concerning the inquisition, or the holy fathers, or gave the least\r\ndistant hint concerning the cause of their confinement.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock Mary rang a bell, which was a signal for all to retire\r\nto their respective apartments, and I was conducted to the chamber of\r\nDon Francisco, where I slept. The next morning Mary brought me a richer\r\ndress than any I had yet had; and as soon as I retired to my apartment,\r\nall the ladies came to wish me good-morning, dressed much richer than\r\nthe preceding day. We passed the time till eight o'clock in the evening,\r\nin much the same manner as we had done the day before. At that time the\r\nbell rang, the separation took place, and I was conducted to Don\r\nFrancisco's chamber. The next morning I had a garment richer than the\r\nlast, and they accosted me in apparel still more sumptuous than before.\r\nThe transactions of the two former days were repeated on the third, and\r\nthe evening concluded in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth morning Mary came into Don Francisco's chamber and told me\r\nI must immediately rise, for a lady wanted me in her own chamber. She\r\nspoke with a kind of authority which surprised me; but as Don Francisco\r\ndid not speak a syllable, I got up and obeyed. Mary then conveyed me\r\ninto a dismal dungeon, not eight feet in length; and said sternly to me,\r\nThis is your room, and this lady your bed-fellow and companion. At which\r\nwords she bounced out of the room, and left me in the utmost\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining a considerable time in the most dreadful agonies tears\r\ncame to my relief, and I exclaimed, \"What is this place, dear lady! Is\r\nit a scene of enchantment, or is it a hell upon earth! Alas! I have lost\r\nmy honour and my soul forever!\"\r\n\r\nThe lady took me by the hand, and said in a sympathizing tone of voice,\r\n\"Dear sister, (for this is the name I shall henceforth give you) forbear\r\nto cry and grieve, for you can do nothing by such an extravagant\r\nbehaviour, but draw upon yourself a cruel death. Your misfortunes, and\r\nthose of all the ladies you have seen, are exactly of a piece, you\r\nsuffer nothing but what we have suffered before you; but we dare not\r\nshow our grief, for fear of greater evils. Pray take courage, and hope\r\nin God, for he will surely deliver us from this hellish place; but be\r\nsure you discover no uneasiness before Mary, who is the only instrument\r\neither of our torments or comfort. Have patience until we go to bed, and\r\nthen I will venture to tell you more of the matter.\"\r\n\r\nMy perplexity and vexation were inexpressible: but my new companion,\r\nwhose name was Leonora, prevailed on me to disguise my uneasiness from\r\nMary. I dissembled tolerably well when she came to bring our dinners,\r\nbut could not help remarking, in my own mind, the difference between\r\nthis repast, and those I had before partook of. This consisted only of\r\nplain, common food, and of that a scanty allowance, with one plate, and\r\none knife and fork for us both, which she took away as soon as we had\r\ndined.\r\n\r\nWhen we were in bed, Leonora was as good as her word; and upon my solemn\r\npromise of secrecy thus began to open her mind to me.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sister, you think your case very hard, but I assure you all the\r\nladies in the house have gone through the same. In time, you will know\r\nall their stories, as they hope to know yours. I suppose Mary has been\r\nthe chief instrument of your fright, as she has been of ours; and I\r\nwarrant she has shown you some horrible places, though not all; and\r\nthat, at the very thought of them you were so terrified, that you chose\r\nthe same way we have done to redeem yourself from death. By what hath\r\nhappened to us, we know that Don Francisco hath been your Nero, your\r\ntyrant; for the three colours of our clothes are the distinguishing\r\ntokens of the three holy fathers. The red silk belongs to Don Francisco,\r\nthe blue to Don Guerrero, and the green to Don Aliga; and they always\r\ngive those colours (after the farce of changing garments and the\r\nshort-lived recreations are over) to those ladies whom they bring here\r\nfor their respective uses.\r\n\r\n\"We are strictly commanded to express all the demonstrations of joy, and\r\nto be very merry for three days, when a young lady first comes amongst\r\nus, as we did with you, and as you must now do with others. But\r\nafterward we live like the most wretched prisoners, without seeing any\r\nbody but Mary, and the other maid-servants, over whom Mary hath a kind\r\nof superiority, for she acts as housekeeper. We all dine in the great\r\nhall three days in a week; and when any one of the inquisitors hath a\r\nmind for one of his slaves, Mary comes about nine o'clock, and leads her\r\nto his apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Some nights Mary leaves the doors of our chambers open, and that is a\r\ntoken that one of the inquisitors hath a mind to come that night; but he\r\ncomes so silent that we are ignorant whether he is our patron or not. If\r\none of us happens to be with child, she is removed into a better chamber\r\ntill she is delivered; but during the whole of her pregnancy, she never\r\nsees any body but the person appointed to attend her.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the child is born it is taken away, and carried we know not\r\nwhither; for we never hear a syllable mentioned about it afterward. I\r\nhave been in this house six years, was not fourteen when the officers\r\ntook me from my father's house, and have had one child. There are, at\r\nthis present time, fifty-two young ladies in the house; but we annually\r\nlose six or eight, though we know not what becomes of them, or whither\r\nthey are sent. This, however, does not diminish our number, for new ones\r\nare always brought in to supply the place of those who are removed from\r\nhence; and I remember, at one time, to have seen seventy-three ladies\r\nhere together. Our continual torment is to reflect that when they are\r\ntired of any of the ladies, they certainly put to death those they\r\npretend to send away; for it is natural to think, that they have too\r\nmuch policy to suffer their atrocious and infernal villanies to be\r\ndiscovered, by enlarging them. Hence our situation is miserable indeed,\r\nand we have only to pray that the Almighty will pardon those crimes\r\nwhich we are compelled to commit. Therefore, my dear sister, arm\r\nyourself with patience, for that is the only palliative to give you\r\ncomfort, and put a firm confidence in the providence of Almighty God.\"\r\n\r\nThis discourse of Leonora greatly affected me; but I found everything to\r\nbe as she told me, in the course of time, and I took care to appear as\r\ncheerful as possible before Mary. In this manner I continued eighteen\r\nmonths, during which time eleven ladies were taken from the house; but\r\nin lieu of them we got nineteen new ones, which made our number just\r\nsixty, at the time we were so happily relieved by the French officers,\r\nand providentially restored to the joys of society, and to the arms of\r\nour parents and friends. On that happy day, the door of my dungeon was\r\nopened by the gentleman who is now my husband, and who with the utmost\r\nexpedition, sent both Leonora and me to his father's; and (soon after\r\nthe campaign was over) when he returned home, he thought proper to make\r\nme his wife, in which situation I enjoy a recompense for all the\r\nmiseries I before suffered.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing narrative it is evident, that the inquisitors are a\r\nset of libidinous villains, lost to every just idea of religion, and\r\ntotally destitute of humanity. Those who possess wealth, beauty, or\r\nliberal sentiments, are sure to find enemies in them. Avarice, lust, and\r\nprejudice, are their ruling passions; and they sacrifice every law,\r\nhuman and divine, to gratify their predominant desire. Their supposed\r\npiety is affectation; their pretended compassion hypocrisy; their\r\njustice depends on their will: and their equitable punishments are\r\nfounded on their prejudices. None are secure from them, all ranks fall\r\nequally victims to their pride, their power, their avarice, or their\r\naversion.\r\n\r\nSome may suggest, that it is strange crowned heads and eminent nobles,\r\nhave not attempted to crush the power of the inquisition, and reduce the\r\nauthority of those ecclesiastical tyrants, from whose merciless fangs\r\nneither their families nor themselves are secure.\r\n\r\nBut astonishing as it is, superstition hath, in this case, always\r\novercome common sense, and custom operated against reason. One prince,\r\nindeed, intended to abolish the inquisition, but he lost his life before\r\nhe became king, and consequently before he had the power so to do; for\r\nthe very intimation of his design procured his destruction.\r\n\r\nThis was that amiable prince Don Carlos, son of Philip the Second, king\r\nof Spain, and grandson of the celebrated emperor Charles V. Don Carlos,\r\npossessed all the good qualities of his grandfather without any of the\r\nbad ones of his father; and was a prince of great vivacity, admirable\r\nlearning, and the most amiable disposition.--He had sense enough to see\r\ninto the errors of popery, and abhorred the very name of the\r\ninquisition. He inveighed publicly against the institution, ridiculed\r\nthe affected piety of the inquisitors, did all he could to expose their\r\natrocious deeds, end even declared, that if he ever came to the crown,\r\nhe would abolish the inquisition, and exterminate its agents.\r\n\r\nThese things were sufficient to irritate the inquisitors against the\r\nprince: they, accordingly, bent their minds to vengeance, and determined\r\non his destruction.\r\n\r\nThe inquisitors now employed all their agents and emissaries to spread\r\nabroad the most artful insinuations against the prince; and, at length,\r\nraised such a spirit of discontent among the people, that the king was\r\nunder the necessity of removing Don Carlos from court. Not content with\r\nthis, they pursued even his friends, and obliged the king likewise to\r\nbanish Don John, duke of Austria, his own brother, and consequently\r\nuncle to the prince; together with the prince of Parma, nephew to the\r\nking, and cousin to the prince, because they well knew that both the\r\nduke of Austria, and the prince of Parma, had a most sincere and\r\ninviolable attachment to Don Carlos.\r\n\r\nSome few years after, the prince having shown great lenity and favour to\r\nthe protestants in the Netherlands, the inquisition loudly exclaimed\r\nagainst him, declaring, that as the persons in question were heretics,\r\nthe prince himself must necessarily be one, since he gave them\r\ncountenance. In short, they gained so great an ascendency over the mind\r\nof the king, who was absolutely a slave to superstition, that, shocking\r\nto relate, he sacrificed the feelings of nature to the force of bigotry,\r\nand, for fear of incurring the anger of the inquisition, gave up his\r\nonly son, passing the sentence of death on him himself.\r\n\r\nThe prince, indeed, had what was termed an indulgence; that is, he was\r\npermitted to choose the manner of his death. Roman like, the unfortunate\r\nyoung hero chose bleeding and the hot bath; when the veins of his arms\r\nand legs being opened, he expired gradually, falling a martyr to the\r\nmalice of the inquisitors, and the stupid bigotry of his father.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Persecution of Dr. AEgidio._\r\n\r\nDr. AEgidio was educated at the university of Alcala, where he took his\r\nseveral degrees, and particularly applied himself to the study of the\r\nsacred scriptures and school divinity. The professor of theology dying,\r\nhe was elected into his place, and acted so much to the satisfaction of\r\nevery one, that his reputation for learning and piety was circulated\r\nthroughout Europe.\r\n\r\nAEgidio, however, had his enemies, and these laid a complaint against him\r\nto the inquisitors, who sent him a citation, and when he appeared to it,\r\ncast him into a dungeon.\r\n\r\nAs the greatest part of those who belonged to the cathedral church at\r\nSeville, and many persons belonging to the bishopric of Dortois highly\r\napproved of the doctrines of AEgidio, which they thought perfectly\r\nconsonant with true religion, they petitioned the emperor in his behalf.\r\nThough the monarch had been educated a Roman catholic, he had too much\r\nsense to be a bigot, and therefore sent an immediate order for his\r\nenlargement.\r\n\r\nHe soon after visited the church of Valladolid, did every thing he could\r\nto promote the cause of religion, and returning home he soon after fell\r\nsick, and died in an extreme old age.\r\n\r\nThe inquisitors having been disappointed of gratifying their malice\r\nagainst him while living, determined (as the emperor's whole thoughts\r\nwere engrossed by a military expedition) to wreak their vengeance on him\r\nwhen dead. Therefore, soon after he was buried, they ordered his remains\r\nto be dug out of the grave; and a legal process being carried on, they\r\nwere condemned to be burnt, which was executed accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Persecution of Dr. Constantine._\r\n\r\nDr. Constantine, an intimate acquaintance of the already mentioned Dr.\r\nAEgidio, was a man of uncommon natural abilities and profound learning;\r\nexclusive of several modern tongues, he was acquainted with the Latin,\r\nGreek, and Hebrew languages, and perfectly well knew not only the\r\nsciences called abstruse, but those arts which come under the\r\ndenomination of polite literature.\r\n\r\nHis eloquence rendered him pleasing, and the soundness of his doctrines\r\na profitable preacher; and he was so popular, that he never preached but\r\nto a crowded audience. He had many opportunities of rising in the\r\nchurch, but never would take advantage of them; for if a living of\r\ngreater value than his own was offered him, he would refuse it, saying,\r\nI am content with what I have; and he frequently preached so forcibly\r\nagainst simony, that many of his superiors, who were not so delicate\r\nupon the subject, took umbrage at his doctrines upon that head.\r\n\r\nHaving been fully confirmed in protestantism by Dr. AEgidio, he preached\r\nboldly such doctrines only as were agreeable to gospel purity, and\r\nuncontaminated by the errors which had at various times crept into the\r\nRomish church. For these reasons he had many enemies among the Roman\r\ncatholics, and some of them were fully determined on his destruction.\r\n\r\nA worthy gentleman named Scobaria, having erected a school for divinity\r\nlectures, appointed Dr. Constantine to be reader therein. He immediately\r\nundertook the task, and read lectures, by portions, on the Proverbs,\r\nEcclesiastes, and Canticles; and was beginning to expound the book of\r\nJob, when he was seized by the inquisitors.\r\n\r\nBeing brought to examination, he answered with such precaution that they\r\ncould not find any explicit charge against him, but remained doubtful in\r\nwhat manner to proceed, when the following circumstances occurred to\r\ndetermine them.\r\n\r\nDr. Constantine had deposited with a woman named Isabella Martin several\r\nbooks, which to him were very valuable, but which he knew, in the eyes\r\nof the inquisition, were exceptionable.\r\n\r\nThis woman having been informed against as a protestant, was\r\napprehended, and, after a small process, her goods were ordered to be\r\nconfiscated. Previous, however, to the officers coming to her house, the\r\nwoman's son had removed away several chests full of the most valuable\r\narticles; and among these were Dr. Constantine's books.\r\n\r\nA treacherous servant giving intelligence of this to the inquisitors, an\r\nofficer was despatched to the son to demand the chests. The son,\r\nsupposing the officer only came for Constantine's books, said, I know\r\nwhat you come for, and I will fetch them to you immediately. He then\r\nfetched Dr. Constantine's books and papers, when the officer was greatly\r\nsurprised to find what he did not look for. He, however, told the young\r\nman, that he was glad these books and papers were produced, but\r\nnevertheless he must fulfil the end of his commission, which was, to\r\ncarry him and the goods he had embezzled before the inquisitors, which\r\nhe did accordingly; for the young man knew it would be in vain to\r\nexpostulate, or resist, and therefore quietly submitted to his fate.\r\n\r\nThe inquisitors being thus possessed of Constantine's books and\r\nwritings, now found matter sufficient to form charges against him. When\r\nhe was brought to a re-examination, they presented one of his papers,\r\nand asked him if he knew the hand writing! Perceiving it was his own, he\r\nguessed the whole matter, confessed the writing, and justified the\r\ndoctrine it contained: saying, \"In that, and all my other writings, I\r\nhave never departed from the truth of the gospel, but have always kept\r\nin view the pure precepts of Christ, as he delivered them to mankind.\"\r\n\r\nAfter being detained upwards of two years in prison, Dr. Constantine was\r\nseized with a bloody flux, which put an end to his miseries in this\r\nworld. The process, however, was carried on against his body, which, at\r\nthe ensuing auto de fe, was publicly burnt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Life of William Gardiner._\r\n\r\nWilliam Gardiner was born at Bristol, received a tolerable education,\r\nand was, at a proper age, placed under the care of a merchant, named\r\nPaget.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-six years, he was, by his master, sent to Lisbon,\r\nto act as factor. Here he applied himself to the study of the Portuguese\r\nlanguage, executed his business with assiduity and despatch, and behaved\r\nwith the most engaging affability to all persons with whom he had the\r\nleast concern. He conversed privately with a few, whom he knew to be\r\nzealous protestants; and, at the same time cautiously avoided giving the\r\nleast offence to any who were Roman catholics; he had not, however,\r\nhitherto gone into any of the popish churches.\r\n\r\nA marriage being concluded between the king of Portugal's son, and the\r\nInfanta of Spain, upon the wedding-day the bride-groom, bride, and the\r\nwhole court went to the cathedral church, attended by multitudes of all\r\nranks of people, and among the rest William Gardiner who stayed during\r\nthe whole ceremony, and was greatly shocked at the superstitions he saw.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous worship which he had seen ran strongly in his mind, he was\r\nmiserable to see a whole country sunk into such idolatry, when the truth\r\nof the gospel might be so easily obtained. He, therefore, took the\r\ninconsiderate, though laudable design, into his head, of making a reform\r\nin Portugal, or perishing in the attempt; and determined to sacrifice\r\nhis prudence to his zeal, though he became a martyr upon the occasion.\r\n\r\nTo this end, he settled all his worldly affairs, paid his debts, closed\r\nhis books, and consigned over his merchandize. On the ensuing Sunday he\r\nwent again to the cathedral church, with a New Testament in his hand,\r\nand placed himself near the altar.\r\n\r\nThe king and the court soon appeared, and a cardinal began mass at that\r\npart of the ceremony in which the people adore the wafer, Gardiner could\r\nhold out no longer, but springing towards the cardinal, he snatched the\r\nhost from him, and trampled it under his feet.\r\n\r\nThis action amazed the whole congregation, and one person drawing a\r\ndagger, wounded Gardiner in the shoulder, and would, by repeating the\r\nblow, have finished him, had not the king called to him to desist.\r\n\r\nGardiner, being carried before the king, the monarch asked him what\r\ncountryman he was: to which he replied, I am an Englishman by birth, a\r\nprotestant by religion, and a merchant by occupation. What I have done\r\nis not out of contempt to your royal person, God forbid it should, but\r\nout of an honest indignation, to see the ridiculous superstitions and\r\ngross idolatries practised here.\r\n\r\nThe king, thinking that he had been stimulated by some other person to\r\nact as he had done, demanded who was his abetter, to which he replied,\r\nMy own conscience alone. I would not hazard what I have done for any man\r\nliving, but I owe that and all other services to God.\r\n\r\nGardiner was sent to prison, and a general order issued to apprehend all\r\nEnglishmen in Lisbon. This order was in a great measure put into\r\nexecution, (some few escaping) and many innocent persons were tortured\r\nto make them confess if they knew any thing of the matter; in\r\nparticular, a person who resided in the same house with Gardiner, was\r\ntreated with unparallelled barbarity to make him confess something which\r\nmight throw a light upon the affair.\r\n\r\nGardiner himself was then tormented in the most excruciating manner; but\r\nin the midst of all his torments he gloried in the deed. Being ordered\r\nfor death, a large fire was kindled near a gibbet, Gardiner was drawn up\r\nto the gibbet by pulleys, and then let down near the fire, but not so\r\nclose as to touch it; for they burnt or rather roasted him by slow\r\ndegrees. Yet he bore his sufferings patiently and resigned his soul to\r\nthe Lord cheerfully.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that some of the sparks were blown from the fire,\r\n(which consumed Gardiner) towards the haven, burnt one of the king's\r\nships of war, and did other considerable damage. The Englishmen who were\r\ntaken up on this occasion were, soon after Gardiner's death, all\r\ndischarged, except the person who resided in the same house with him,\r\nwho was detained two years before he could procure his liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An account of the Life and Sufferings of Mr. William Lithgow, a native\r\nof Scotland._\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was descended from a good family, and having a natural\r\npropensity for travelling, he rambled, when very young, over the\r\nnorthern and western islands; after which he visited France, Germany,\r\nSwitzerland and Spain. He set out on his travels in the month of March,\r\n1609, and the first place he went to was Paris, where he stayed for some\r\ntime. He then prosecuted his travels through Germany and other parts,\r\nand at length arrived at Malaga, in Spain, the seat of all his\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence here, he contracted with the master of a French\r\nship for his passage to Alexandria, but was prevented from going by the\r\nfollowing circumstances. In the evening of the 17th of October, 1620,\r\nthe English fleet, at that time on a cruise against the Algerine rovers,\r\ncame to anchor before Malaga, which threw the people of the town into\r\nthe greatest consternation, as they imagined them to be Turks. The\r\nmorning, however, discovered the mistake, and the governor of Malaga,\r\nperceiving the cross of England in their colours, went on board Sir\r\nRobert Mansell's ship, who commanded on that expedition, and after\r\nstaying some time returned, and silenced the fears of the people.\r\n\r\nThe next day many persons from on board the fleet came ashore. Among\r\nthese were several well known by Mr. Lithgow, who, after reciprocal\r\ncompliments, spent some days together in festivity and the amusements of\r\nthe town. They then invited Mr. Lithgow to go on board, and pay his\r\nrespects to the admiral. He accordingly accepted the invitation, was\r\nkindly received by him, and detained till the next day when the fleet\r\nsailed. The admiral would willingly have taken Mr. Lithgow with him to\r\nAlgiers; but having contracted for his passage to Alexandria, and his\r\nbaggage, &c. being in the town, he could not accept the offer.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mr. Lithgow got on shore, he proceeded towards his lodgings\r\nby a private way, (being to embark the same night for Alexandria) when,\r\nin passing through a narrow uninhabited street, he found himself\r\nsuddenly surrounded by nine sergeants, or officers, who threw a black\r\ncloak over him, and forcibly conducted him to the governor's house.\r\nAfter some little time the governor appeared when Mr. Lithgow earnestly\r\nbegged he might be informed of the cause of such violent treatment. The\r\ngovernor only answered by shaking his head, and gave orders that the\r\nprisoner should be strictly watched till he (the governor) returned from\r\nhis devotions; directing at the same time, that the captain of the town,\r\nthe alcade major, and town notary, should be summoned to appear at his\r\nexamination, and that all this should he done with the greatest secrecy,\r\nto prevent the knowledge thereof reaching the ears of the English\r\nmerchants then residing in the town.\r\n\r\nThese orders were strictly discharged, and on the governor's return, he,\r\nwith the officers, having seated themselves, Mr. Lithgow was brought\r\nbefore them for examination. The governor began by asking several\r\nquestions, namely, of what country he was, whither bound, and how long\r\nhe had been in Spain. The prisoner, after answering these and other\r\nquestions, was conducted to a closet, where, in a short space of time,\r\nhe was visited by the town-captain, who inquired whether he had ever\r\nbeen at Seville, or was lately come from thence; and patting his cheeks\r\nwith an air of friendship conjured him to tell the truth: \"For (said he)\r\nyour very countenance shows there is some hidden matter in your mind,\r\nwhich prudence should direct you to disclose.\" Finding himself, however,\r\nunable to extort anything from the prisoner, he left him, and reported\r\nthe same to the governor and the other officers; on which Mr. Lithgow\r\nwas again brought before them, a general accusation was laid against\r\nhim, and he was compelled to swear that he would give true answers to\r\nsuch questions as should be asked him.\r\n\r\nThe governor proceeded to inquire the quality of the English commander,\r\nand the prisoner's opinion what were the motives that prevented his\r\naccepting an invitation from him to come on shore. He demanded,\r\nlikewise, the names of the English captains in the squadron, and what\r\nknowledge he had of the embarkation, or preparation for it before his\r\ndeparture from England. The answers given to the several questions asked\r\nwere set down in writing by the notary; but the junto seemed surprised\r\nat his denying any knowledge of the fitting out of the fleet,\r\nparticularly the governor, who said he lied that he was a traitor and a\r\nspy, and came directly from England to favour and assist the designs\r\nthat were projected against Spain, and that he had been for that purpose\r\nnine months in Seville, in order to procure intelligence of the time the\r\nSpanish navy was expected from the Indies. They exclaimed against his\r\nfamiliarity with the officers of the fleet, and many other English\r\ngentlemen, between whom, they said, unusual civilities had passed, but\r\nall these transactions had been carefully noticed.\r\n\r\nBesides, to sum up the whole, and put the truth past all doubt, they\r\nsaid, he came from a council of war, held that morning on board the\r\nadmiral's ship, in order to put in execution the orders assigned him.\r\nThey upbraided him with being accessary to the burning of the island of\r\nSt. Thomas, in the West Indies. \"Wherefore, (said they) these\r\nLutherans, and sons of the devil, ought to have no credit given to what\r\nthey say or swear.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain did Mr. Lithgow, endeavour to obviate every accusation laid\r\nagainst him, and to obtain belief from his prejudiced judges. He begged\r\npermission to send for his cloak-bag, which contained his papers, and\r\nmight serve to show his innocence. This request they complied with,\r\nthinking it would discover some things of which they were ignorant. The\r\ncloak-bag was accordingly brought, and being opened, among other things,\r\nwas found a license from king James the First, under the sign manuel,\r\nsetting forth the bearer's intention to travel into Egypt; which was\r\ntreated by the haughty Spaniards with great contempt. The other papers\r\nconsisted of passports, testimonials, &c. of persons of quality. All\r\nthese credentials, however, seemed rather to confirm than abate the\r\nsuspicions of these prejudiced judges, who, after seizing all the\r\nprisoner's papers, ordered him again to withdraw.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time a consultation was held to fix the place where the\r\nprisoner should be confined. The alcade, or chief judge, was for putting\r\nhim into the town prison; but this was objected to, particularly by the\r\ncorregidor, who said, in Spanish, \"In order to prevent the knowledge of\r\nhis confinement from reaching his countrymen, I will take the matter on\r\nmyself, and be answerable for the consequences;\" upon which it was\r\nagreed, that he should be confined in the governor's house with the\r\ngreatest secrecy.\r\n\r\nThis matter being determined, one of the sergeants went to Mr. Lithgow,\r\nand begged his money, with liberty to search him. As it was needless to\r\nmake any resistance, the prisoner quietly complied, when the sergeant\r\n(after rifling his pockets of eleven ducatoons) stripped him to his\r\nshirt; and searching his breeches he found, enclosed in the waistband,\r\ntwo canvass bags, containing one hundred and thirty-seven pieces of\r\ngold. The sergeant immediately took the money to the corregidor, who,\r\nafter having told it over, ordered him to clothe the prisoner, and shut\r\nhim up close till after supper.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight, the sergeant and two Turkish slaves released Mr. Lithgow\r\nfrom his then confinement, but it was to introduce him to one much more\r\nhorrible. They conducted him through several passages, to a chamber in a\r\nremote part of the palace, towards the garden, where they loaded him\r\nwith irons, and extended his legs by means of an iron bar above a yard\r\nlong, the weight of which was so great that he could neither stand nor\r\nsit, but was obliged to lie continually on his back. They left him in\r\nthis condition for some time, when they returned with a refreshment of\r\nfood, consisting of a pound of boiled mutton and a loaf, together with a\r\nsmall quantity of wine; which was not only the first, but the best and\r\nlast of the kind, during his confinement in this place. After delivering\r\nthese articles, the sergeant locked the door, and left Mr. Lithgow to\r\nhis own private contemplations.\r\n\r\nThe next day he received a visit from the governor, who promised him his\r\nliberty, with many other advantages, if he would confess being a spy;\r\nbut on his protesting that he was entirely innocent, the governor left\r\nhim in a rage, saying, He should see him no more till farther torments\r\nconstrained him to confess, commanding the keeper, to whose care he was\r\ncommitted, that he should permit no person whatever to have access to,\r\nor commune with him; that his sustenance should not exceed three ounces\r\nof musty bread, and a pint of water every second day; that he shall be\r\nallowed neither bed, pillow, nor coverlid. \"Close up (said he) this\r\nwindow in his room with lime and stone, stop up the holes of the door\r\nwith double mats: let him have nothing that bears any likeness to\r\ncomfort.\" These, and several other orders of the like severity, were\r\ngiven to render it impossible for his condition to be known to those of\r\nthe English nation.\r\n\r\nIn this wretched and melancholy state did poor Lithgow continue without\r\nseeing any person for several days, in which time the governor received\r\nan answer to a letter he had written, relative to the prisoner from\r\nMadrid; and, pursuant to the instructions given him, began to put in\r\npractice the cruelties devised, which they hastened, because Christmas\r\nholy-days approached, it being then the forty-seventh day since his\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock in the morning, he heard the noise of a coach in the\r\nstreet, and some time after heard the opening of the prison doors, not\r\nhaving had any sleep for two nights; hunger, pain, and melancholy\r\nreflections having prevented him from taking any repose.\r\n\r\nSoon after the prison doors were opened, the nine sergeants, who had\r\nfirst seized him, entered the place where he lay, and without uttering a\r\nword, conducted him in his irons through the house into the street,\r\nwhere a coach waited, and into which they laid him at the bottom on his\r\nback, not being able to sit. Two of the sergeants rode with him, and the\r\nrest walked by the coach side, but all observed the most profound\r\nsilence. They drove him to a vinepress house, about a league from the\r\ntown, to which place a rack had been privately conveyed before; and here\r\nthey shut him up for that night.\r\n\r\nAt day-break the next morning, arrived the governor and the alcade, into\r\nwhose presence Mr. Lithgow was immediately brought to undergo another\r\nexamination. The prisoner desired he might have an interpreter, which\r\nwas allowed to strangers by the laws of that country, but this was\r\nrefused, nor would they permit him to appeal to Madrid, the superior\r\ncourt of judicature. After a long examination, which lasted from morning\r\ntill night, there appeared in all his answers so exact a conformity with\r\nwhat he had before said, that they declared he had learned them by\r\nheart, there not being the least prevarication. They, however, pressed\r\nhim again to make a full discovery; that is, to accuse himself of crimes\r\nnever committed, the governor adding, \"You are still in my power; I can\r\nset you free if you comply, if not, I must deliver you to the alcade.\"\r\nMr. Lithgow still persisting in his innocence, the governor ordered the\r\nnotary to draw up a warrant for delivering him to the alcade to be\r\ntortured.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this he was conducted by the sergeants to the end of a\r\nstone gallery, where the rack was placed. The encarouador or\r\nexecutioner, immediately struck off his irons, which put him to very\r\ngreat pains, the bolts being so close riveted, that the sledge hammer\r\ntore away half an inch of his heel, in forcing off the bolt; the anguish\r\nof which, together with his weak condition, (not having the least\r\nsustenance for three days) occasioned him to groan bitterly; upon which\r\nthe merciless alcade said, \"Villain, traitor, this is but the earnest of\r\nwhat you shall endure.\"\r\n\r\nWhen his irons were off he fell on his knees, uttering a short prayer,\r\nthat God would be pleased to enable him to be steadfast, and undergo\r\ncourageously the grievous trial he had to encounter. The alcade and\r\nnotary having placed themselves in chairs, he was stripped naked, and\r\nfixed upon the rack, the office of these gentlemen being to be witness\r\nof, and set down the confessions and tortures endured by the delinquent.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe all the various tortures inflicted upon\r\nhim. Suffice it to say, that he lay on the rack for above five hours,\r\nduring which time he received above sixty different tortures of the most\r\nhellish nature; and had they continued them a few minutes longer, he\r\nmust have inevitably perished.\r\n\r\nThese cruel persecutors being satisfied for the present, the prisoner\r\nwas taken from the rack, and his irons being again put on, he was\r\nconducted to his former dungeon, having received no other nourishment\r\nthan a little warm wine, which was given him rather to prevent his\r\ndying, and reserve him for future punishments, than from any principle\r\nof charity or compassion.\r\n\r\nAs a confirmation of this, orders were given for a coach to pass every\r\nmorning before day by the prison, that the noise made by it might give\r\nfresh terrors and alarms to the unhappy prisoner, and deprive him of all\r\npossibility of obtaining the least repose.\r\n\r\nHe continued in this horrid situation, almost starved for want of the\r\ncommon necessaries to preserve his wretched existence, till Christmas\r\nday, when he received some relief from Mariane, waiting-woman to the\r\ngovernor's lady. This woman having obtained leave to visit him, carried\r\nwith her some refreshments, consisting of honey, sugar, raisins, and\r\nother articles: and so affected was she at beholding his situation, that\r\nshe wept bitterly, and at her departure expressed the greatest concern\r\nat not being able to give him further assistance.\r\n\r\nIn this loathsome prison was poor Mr. Lithgow kept till he was almost\r\ndevoured by vermin. They crawled about his beard, lips, eye-brows, &c.\r\nso that he could scarce open his eyes; and his mortification was\r\nincreased by not having the use of his hands or legs to defend himself,\r\nfrom his being so miserably maimed by the tortures. So cruel was the\r\ngovernor, that he even ordered the vermin to be swept on him twice in\r\nevery eight days. He, however obtained some little mitigation of this\r\npart of his punishment, from the humanity of a Turkish slave that\r\nattended him, who, when he could do it with safety, destroyed the\r\nvermin, and contributed every refreshment to him that laid in his power.\r\n\r\nFrom this slave Mr. Lithgow at length received information which gave\r\nhim little hopes of ever being released, but, on the contrary, that he\r\nshould finish his life under new tortures. The substance of this\r\ninformation was, that an English seminary priest, and a Scotch cooper,\r\nhad been for some time employed by the governor to translate from the\r\nEnglish into the Spanish language, all his books and observations; and\r\nthat it was commonly said in the governor's house, that he was an arch\r\nheretic.\r\n\r\nThis information greatly alarmed him, and he began, not without reason,\r\nto fear that they would soon finish him, more especially as they could\r\nneither by torture or any other means, bring him to vary from what he\r\nhad all along said at his different examinations.\r\n\r\nTwo days after he had received the above information, the governor, an\r\ninquisitor, and a canonical priest, accompanied by two Jesuits, entered\r\nhis dungeon, and being seated, after several idle questions, the\r\ninquisitor asked Mr. Lithgow if he was a Roman catholic, and\r\nacknowledged the pope's supremacy? He answered, that he neither was the\r\none or did the other; adding, that he was surprised at being asked such\r\nquestions, since it was expressly stipulated by the articles of peace\r\nbetween England and Spain, that none of the English subjects should be\r\nliable to the inquisition, or any way molested by them on account of\r\ndiversity in religion, &c. In the bitterness of his soul he made use of\r\nsome warm expressions not suited to his circumstances: \"As you have\r\nalmost murdered me (said he) for pretended treason, so now you intend to\r\nmake a martyr of me for my religion.\" He also expostulated with the\r\ngovernor on the ill return he made to the king of England, (whose\r\nsubject he was) for the princely humanity exercised towards the\r\nSpaniards in 1588, when their armada was shipwrecked on the Scotch\r\ncoast, and thousands of the Spaniards found relief, who must otherwise\r\nhave miserably perished.\r\n\r\nThe governor admitted the truth of what Mr. Lithgow said, but replied\r\nwith a haughty air, that the king, who then only ruled Scotland, was\r\nactuated more by fear than love, and therefore did not deserve any\r\nthanks. One of the Jesuits said, there was no faith to be kept with\r\nheretics. The inquisitor then rising, addressed himself to Mr Lithgow in\r\nthe following words: \"You have been taken up as a spy, accused of\r\ntreachery, and tortured, as we acknowledge, innocently: (which appears\r\nby the account lately received from Madrid of the intentions of the\r\nEnglish) yet it was the divine power that brought those judgments upon\r\nyou, for presumptuously treating the blessed miracle of Loretto with\r\nridicule, and expressing yourself in your writings irreverently of his\r\nholiness, the great agent and Christ's vicar upon earth; therefore you\r\nare justly fallen into our hands by their special appointment: thy\r\nbooks and papers are miraculously translated by the assistance of\r\nProvidence influencing thy own countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nThis trumpery being ended, they gave the prisoner eight days to consider\r\nand resolve whether he would become a convert to their religion; during\r\nwhich time the inquisitor told him he, with other religious orders,\r\nwould attend, to give him such assistance thereto as he might want. One\r\nof the Jesuits said, (first making the sign of the cross upon his\r\nbreast) \"My son, behold, you deserve to be burnt alive; but by the grace\r\nof our lady of Loretto, whom you have blasphemed, we will both save your\r\nsoul and body.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning, the inquisitor with three other ecclesiastics returned,\r\nwhen the former asked the prisoner what difficulties he had on his\r\nconscience that retarded his conversion; to which he answered, \"he had\r\nnot any doubts in his mind, being confident in the promises of Christ,\r\nand assuredly believing his revealed will signified in the gospels, as\r\nprofessed in the reformed catholic church, being confirmed by grace, and\r\nhaving infallible assurance thereby of the christian faith.\" To these\r\nwords the inquisitor replied, \"Thou art no christian, but an absurd\r\nheretic, and without conversion a member of perdition.\" The prisoner\r\nthen told him, it was not consistent with the nature and essence of\r\nreligion and charity to convince by opprobrious speeches, racks, and\r\ntorments, but by arguments deduced from the scriptures; and that all\r\nother methods would with him be totally ineffectual.\r\n\r\nThe inquisitor was so enraged at the replies made by the prisoner, that\r\nhe struck him on the face, used many abusive speeches, and attempted to\r\nstab him, which he had certainly done had he not been prevented by the\r\nJesuits: and from this time he never again visited the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe next day the two Jesuits returned, and putting on a very grave\r\nsupercilious air, the superior asked him, what resolution he had taken?\r\nTo which Mr. Lithgow replied, that he was already resolved, unless he\r\ncould show substantial reasons to make him alter his opinion. The\r\nsuperior, after a pedantic display of their seven sacraments, the\r\nintercession of saints, transubstantiation, &c. boasted greatly of their\r\nchurch, her antiquity, universality, and uniformity; all which Mr.\r\nLithgow denied: \"For (said he) the profession of the faith I hold hath\r\nbeen ever since the first days of the apostles, and Christ had ever his\r\nown church (however obscure) in the greatest time of your darkness.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, finding their arguments had not the desired effect, that\r\ntorments could not shake his constancy, nor even the fear of the cruel\r\nsentence he had reason to expect would be pronounced and executed on\r\nhim, after severe menaces, left him. On the eighth day after being the\r\nlast of their inquisition, when sentence is pronounced, they returned\r\nagain, but quite altered both in their words and behaviour after\r\nrepeating much of the same kind of arguments as before, they with\r\nseeming tears in their eyes, pretended they were sorry from their heart\r\nhe must be obliged to undergo a terrible death, but above all, for the\r\nloss of his most precious soul; and falling on their knees, cried out,\r\n\"Convert, convert, O dear brother, for our blessed lady's sake convert!\"\r\nTo which he answered, \"I fear neither death nor fire, being prepared for\r\nboth.\"\r\n\r\nThe first effects Mr. Lithgow felt of the determination of this bloody\r\ntribunal was, a sentence to receive that night eleven different\r\ntortures, and if he did not die in the execution of them, (which might\r\nbe reasonably expected from the maimed and disjointed condition he was\r\nin) he was, after Easter holy-days, to be carried to Grenada, and there\r\nburnt to ashes. The first part of this sentence was executed with great\r\nbarbarity that night; and it pleased God to give him strength both of\r\nbody and mind, to stand fast to the truth, and to survive the horrid\r\npunishments inflicted on him.\r\n\r\nAfter these barbarians had glutted themselves for the present, with\r\nexercising on the unhappy prisoner the most distinguished cruelties,\r\nthey again put irons on, and conveyed him to his former dungeon. The\r\nnext morning he received some little comfort from the Turkish slave\r\nbefore mentioned, who secretly brought him, in his shirt sleeve, some\r\nraisins and figs, which he licked up in the best manner his strength\r\nwould permit with his tongue. It was to this slave Mr. Lithgow\r\nattributed his surviving so long in such a wretched situation; for he\r\nfound means to convey some of these fruits to him twice every week. It\r\nis very extraordinary, and worthy of note, that this poor slave, bred up\r\nfrom his infancy, according to the maxims of his prophet and parents, in\r\nthe greatest detestation of christians, should be so affected at the\r\nmiserable situation of Mr. Lithgow, that he fell ill, and continued so\r\nfor upwards of forty days. During this period Mr. Lithgow was attended\r\nby a negro woman, a slave, who found means to furnish him with\r\nrefreshments still more amply than the Turk, being conversant in the\r\nhouse and family. She brought him every day some victuals, and with it\r\nsome wine in a bottle.\r\n\r\nThe time was now so far elapsed, and the horrid situation so truly\r\nloathsome, that Mr. Lithgow waited with anxious expectation for the day,\r\nwhich, by putting an end to his life, would also end his torments. But\r\nhis melancholy expectations were, by the interposition of Providence,\r\nhappily rendered abortive, and his deliverance obtained from the\r\nfollowing circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Spanish gentleman of quality came from Grenada to\r\nMalaga, who being invited to an entertainment by the governor, he\r\ninformed him of what had befallen Mr. Lithgow from the time of his being\r\napprehended as a spy, and described the various sufferings he had\r\nendured. He likewise told him, that after it was known the prisoner was\r\ninnocent, it gave him great concern. That on this account he would\r\ngladly have released him, restored his money and papers, and made some\r\natonement for the injuries he had received but that, upon an inspection\r\ninto his writings, several were found of a very blasphemous nature,\r\nhighly reflecting on their religion. That on his refusing to abjure\r\nthese heretical opinions, he was turned over to the inquisition, by whom\r\nhe was finally condemned.\r\n\r\nWhile the governor was relating this tragical tale, a Flemish youth\r\n(servant to the Spanish gentleman) who waited at the table, was struck\r\nwith amazement and pity at the sufferings of the stranger described. On\r\nhis return to his master's lodgings he began to revolve in his mind what\r\nhe had heard, which made such an impression on him that he could not\r\nrest in his bed. In the short slumbers he had, his imagination painted\r\nto him the person described, on the rack, and burning in the fire. In\r\nthis anxiety he passed the night; and when the morning came, without\r\ndisclosing his intentions to any person whatever, he went into the town,\r\nand enquired for an English factor. He was directed to the house of a\r\nMr. Wild, to whom he related the whole of what he had heard pass, the\r\npreceding evening, between his master and the governor; but could not\r\ntell Mr. Lithgow's name. Mr. Wild, however, conjectured it was him, by\r\nthe servant's remembering the circumstance of his being a traveller, and\r\nhis having had some acquaintance with him.\r\n\r\nOn the departure of the Flemish servant, Mr. Wild immediately sent for\r\nthe other English factors, to whom he related all the particulars\r\nrelative to their unfortunate countryman. After a short consultation it\r\nwas agreed, that an information of the whole affair should be sent, by\r\nexpress, to Sir Walter Aston, the English ambassador to the king of\r\nSpain, then at Madrid. This was accordingly done, and the ambassador\r\nhaving presented a memorial to the king and council of Spain, he\r\nobtained an order for Mr. Lithgow's enlargement, and his delivery to the\r\nEnglish factory. This order was directed to the governor of Malaga; and\r\nwas received with great dislike and surprise by the whole assembly of\r\nthe bloody inquisition.\r\n\r\nMr. Lithgow was released from his confinement on the eve of Easter\r\nSunday, when he was carried from his dungeon on the back of the slave\r\nwho had attended him, to the house of one Mr. Bosbich, where all proper\r\ncomforts were given him. It fortunately happened, that there was at this\r\ntime a squadron of English ships in the road, commanded by Sir Richard\r\nHawkins, who being informed of the past sufferings and present situation\r\nof Mr. Lithgow, came the next day ashore, with a proper guard, and\r\nreceived him from the merchants. He was instantly carried in blankets on\r\nboard the Vanguard, and three days after was removed to another ship, by\r\ndirection of the general Sir Robert Mansel, who ordered that he should\r\nhave proper care taken of him. The factory presented him with clothes,\r\nand all necessary provisions, besides which they gave him 200 reals in\r\nsilver; and Sir Richard Hawkins sent him two double pistoles.\r\n\r\nBefore his departure from the Spanish coast, Sir Richard Hawkins\r\ndemanded the delivery of his papers, money, books, &c. but could not\r\nobtain any satisfactory answer on that head.\r\n\r\nWe cannot help making a pause here to reflect, how manifestly Providence\r\ninterfered in behalf of this poor man, when he was just on the brink of\r\ndestruction; for by his sentence, from which there was no appeal, he\r\nwould have been taken, in a few days, to Grenada, and burnt to ashes:\r\nand that a poor ordinary servant, who had not the least knowledge of\r\nhim, nor was any ways interested in his preservation, should risk the\r\ndispleasure of his master, and hazard his own life, to disclose a thing\r\nof so momentous and perilous a nature, to a strange gentleman, on whose\r\nsecrecy depended his own existence. By such secondary means does\r\nProvidence frequently interfere in behalf of the virtuous and oppressed;\r\nof which this is a most distinguished example.\r\n\r\nAfter lying twelve days in the road, the ship weighed anchor, and in\r\nabout two months arrived safe at Deptford. The next morning, Mr. Lithgow\r\nwas carried on a feather bed to Theobalds, in Hertfordshire, where at\r\nthat time was the king and royal family. His majesty happened to be that\r\nday engaged in hunting, but on his return in the evening, Mr. Lithgow\r\nwas presented to him, and related the particulars of his sufferings, and\r\nhis happy delivery. The king was so affected at the narrative, that he\r\nexpressed the deepest concern, and gave orders that he should be sent to\r\nBath, and his wants properly supplied from his royal munificence. By\r\nthese means, under God, after some time, Mr. Lithgow was restored, from\r\nthe most wretched spectacle, to a great share of health and strength;\r\nbut he lost the use of his left arm, and several of the smaller bones\r\nwere so crushed and broken, as to be ever after rendered useless.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding every effort was used, Mr. Lithgow could never obtain\r\nany part of his money or effects, though his majesty and the ministers\r\nof state, interested themselves in his behalf. Gondamore, the Spanish\r\nambassador, indeed, promised that all his effects should be restored,\r\nwith the addition of L1000 English money, as some atonement for the\r\ntortures he had undergone, which last was to be paid him by the governor\r\nof Malaga. These engagements, however, were but mere promises; and\r\nthough the king was a kind of guarantee for the well performance of\r\nthem, the cunning Spaniard found means to elude the same. He had,\r\nindeed, too great a share of influence in the English council during the\r\ntime of that pacific reign, when England suffered herself to be bullied\r\ninto slavish compliance by most of the states and kings in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Croly on the Inquisition._\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude this chapter with the subjoined extract from the New\r\nInterpretation of the Apocalypse by the Rev. George Croly.\r\n\r\nIn our fortunate country, the power of the Romish church has so long\r\nperished, that we find some difficulty in conceiving the nature, and\r\nstill more in believing the tyranny of its dominion. The influence of\r\nthe monks and the murders of the inquisition have passed into a nursery\r\ntale; and we turn with a generous, yet rash and most unjustifiable\r\nscepticism from the history of Romish authority.\r\n\r\nThrough almost the entire of Italy, through the Flemish dominions of\r\nGermany, through a large portion of France, and through the entire of\r\nSpain, a great monastic body was established, which, professing a\r\nsecondary and trivial obedience to the sovereign, gave its first and\r\nreal obedience to the pope. The name of spiritual homage cloaked the\r\nhigh treason of an oath of allegiance to a foreign monarch; and whoever\r\nmight be king of France, or Spain, the pope was king of the Dominicans.\r\nAll the other monastic orders were so many papal outposts. But the great\r\nDominican order, immensely opulent in its pretended poverty; formidably\r\npowerful in its hypocritical disdain of earthly influence; and\r\nremorselessly ambitious, turbulent, and cruel in its primitive zeal; was\r\nan actual lodgment and province of the papacy, an inferior Rome, in the\r\nchief European kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIn the closest imitation of Rome, this spiritual power had fiercely\r\nassumed the temporal sword; the inquisition was army, revenues, and\r\nthrone in one. With the racks and fires of a tribunal worthy of the gulf\r\nof darkness and guilt from which it rose, the Dominicans bore popery in\r\ntriumph through christendom, crushing every vestige of religion under\r\nthe wheels of its colossal idol. The subjugation of the Albigenses in\r\n1229 had scattered the church; the shock of the great military masses\r\nwas past; a subtler and more active force was required to destroy the\r\nwandering people of God; and the inquisition multiplied itself for the\r\nwork of death. This terrible tribunal set every principle, and even\r\nevery form of justice at defiance. Secrecy, that confounds innocence\r\nwith guilt, was the spirit of its whole proceeding. All its steps were\r\nin darkness. The suspected revolter from popery was seized in secret,\r\ntried in secret, never suffered to see the face of accuser, witness,\r\nadvocate, or friend, was kept unacquainted with the charge, was urged to\r\ncriminate himself; if tardy, was compelled to this self-murder by the\r\nrack; if terrified, was only the more speedily murdered for the sport of\r\nthe multitude. From the hour of his seizure he never saw the face of\r\nday, until he was brought out as a public show, a loyal and festal\r\nsacrifice, to do honor to the entrance of some travelling viceroy, some\r\nnew married princess, or, on more fortunate occasions, to the presence\r\nof the sovereign. The dungeons were then drained, the human wreck of the\r\ntorture and scourge were gathered out of darkness, groups of misery and\r\nexhaustion with wasted forms and broken limbs, and countenances subdued\r\nby pain and famine into idiotism, and despair, and madness; to feed the\r\nfires round which the Dominicans were chanting the glories of popery,\r\nand exulting in the destruction of the body for the good of the soul!\r\n\r\nIn the original establishment of the inquisition in 1198, it had raged\r\nagainst the Vaudois and their converts. But the victims were exhausted;\r\nor not worth the pursuit of a tribunal which looked to the wealth as\r\nkeenly as to the faith of the persecuted. Opulence and heresy were at\r\nlength to be found only to Spain, and there the inquisition turned with\r\na gigantic step. In the early disturbances of the Peninsula, the Jews,\r\nby those habits of trade, and mutual communion, which still make them\r\nthe lords of commerce, had acquired the chief wealth of the country. The\r\nclose of the Moorish war in the 15th century had left the Spanish\r\nmonarch at leisure for extortion; and he grasped at the Jewish gains in\r\nthe spirit of a robber, as he pursued his plunder with the cruelty of a\r\nbarbarian. The inquisition was the great machine, the comprehensive\r\ntorturer, ready to squeeze out alike the heart and the gold. In 1481, an\r\nedict was issued against the Jews; before the end of the year, in the\r\nsingle diocess of Cadiz, two thousand Jews were burnt alive! The fall of\r\nthe kingdom of Grenada, in 1492, threw the whole of the Spanish Moors\r\ninto the hands of the king. They were cast into the same furnace of\r\nplunder and torture. Desperate rebellions followed; they were defeated\r\nand, in 1609, were finally exiled. \"In the space of one hundred and\r\ntwenty nine years, the inquisition deprived Spain of three millions of\r\ninhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nOn the death of Leo X. in 1521, Adrian, the inquisitor general was\r\nelected pope. He had laid the foundation of his papal celebrity in\r\nSpain. \"It appears, according to the most moderate calculation, that\r\nduring the five years of the ministry of Adrian, 24,025 persons were\r\ncondemned by the inquisition, of whom one thousand six hundred and\r\ntwenty were burned alive.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the constant sophism of those who would cast christianity bound\r\nhand and foot at the mercy of her enemies, that the pope desires to\r\nexercise no interference in the internal concerns of kingdoms; that, if\r\nhe had the desire, he has not the power; and that, if he possessed the\r\npower, he would be resisted by the whole body of the national clergy.\r\nFor the exposure of this traitorous delusion, we are to look to the\r\ntimes, when it was the will of popery to put forth its strength; not to\r\nthe present, when it is its will to lull us into a belief of its\r\nconsistency with the constitution, in defiance of common sense, common\r\nexperience, the spirit of British law, and the loud warnings of insulted\r\nand hazarded religion.\r\n\r\nOf the multitudes who perished by the inquisition throughout the world,\r\nno authentic record is now discoverable. But wherever popery had power,\r\nthere was the tribunal. It had been planted even in the east, and the\r\nPortuguese inquisition of Goa was, till within these few years, fed with\r\nmany an agony. South America was partitioned into provinces of the\r\ninquisition; and with a ghastly mimickry of the crimes of the mother\r\nstate, the arrivals of viceroys, and the other popular celebrations were\r\nthought imperfect without an auto de fe. The Netherlands were one scene\r\nof slaughter from the time of the decree which planted the inquisition\r\namong them. In Spain the calculation is more attainable. Each of the\r\n_seventeen_ tribunals during a long period burned annually on an average\r\nten miserable beings! We are to recollect that this number was in a\r\ncountry where persecution had for ages abolished all religious\r\ndifferences, and where the difficulty was not to find the stake, but\r\nthe offering. Yet, even in Spain, thus gleaned of all heresy, the\r\ninquisition could still swell its list of murders to thirty-two\r\nthousand! The numbers burned in effigy, or condemned to penance,\r\npunishments generally equivalent to exile, confiscation, and taint of\r\nblood, to all ruin but the mere loss of worthless life amounted to three\r\nhundred and nine thousand. But the crowds who perished in dungeons, of\r\nthe torture, of confinement, and of broken hearts, the millions of\r\ndependent lives made utterly helpless, or hurried to the grave by the\r\ndeath of the victims, are beyond all register; or recorded only before\r\nHIM, who has sworn that \"He who leadeth into captivity, shall go into\r\ncaptivity: and he that killeth with the sword shall be killed by the\r\nsword.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the inquisition, declared by the Spirit of God to be at once\r\nthe offspring and the _image_ of the popedom. To feel the force of the\r\nparentage, we must look to the time. In the thirteenth century, the\r\npopedom was at the summit of mortal dominion; it was independent of all\r\nkingdoms; it ruled with a rank of influence never before or since\r\npossessed by a human sceptre; it was the acknowledged sovereign of body\r\nand soul; to all earthly intents its power was immeasurable for good or\r\nevil. It might have spread literature, peace, freedom, and christianity\r\nto the ends of Europe, or the world. But its nature was hostile; its\r\nfuller triumph only disclosed its fuller evil; and, to the shame of\r\nhuman reason, and the terror and suffering of human virtue, Rome, in the\r\nhour of its consummate grandeur, teemed with the monstrous and horrid\r\nbirth of the INQUISITION!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE PERSECUTION IN ITALY, UNDER THE PAPACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now enter on an account of the persecutions in Italy, a country\r\nwhich has been, and still is,\r\n\r\n1. The centre of popery.\r\n\r\n2. The seat of the pontiff.\r\n\r\n3. The source of the various errors which have spread themselves over\r\nother countries, deluded the minds of thousands, and diffused the clouds\r\nof superstition and bigotry over the human understanding.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing our narrative we shall include the most remarkable\r\npersecutions which have happened, and the cruelties which have been\r\npractised,\r\n\r\n1. By the immediate power of the pope.\r\n\r\n2. Through the power of the inquisition.\r\n\r\n3. At the instigation of particular orders of the clergy.\r\n\r\n4. By the bigotry of the Italian princes.\r\n\r\nIn the 12th century, the first persecutions under the papacy began in\r\nItaly, at the time that Adrian, an Englishman, was pope, being\r\noccasioned by the following circumstances:\r\n\r\nA learned man, and an excellent orator of Brixia, named Arnold came to\r\nRome, and boldly preached against the corruptions and innovations which\r\nhad crept into the church. His discourses were so clear, consistent, and\r\nbreathed forth such a pure spirit of piety, that the senators, and many\r\nof the people, highly approved of, and admired his doctrines.\r\n\r\nThis so greatly enraged Adrian, that he commanded Arnold instantly to\r\nleave the city, as a heretic. Arnold, however, did not comply, for the\r\nsenators, and some of the principal people, took his part, and resisted\r\nthe authority of the pope.\r\n\r\nAdrian now laid the city of Rome under an interdict, which caused the\r\nwhole body of clergy to interpose; and, at length, persuaded the\r\nsenators and people to give up the point, and suffer Arnold to be\r\nbanished. This being agreed to, he received the sentence of exile, and\r\nretired to Germany, where he continued to preach against the pope, and\r\nto expose the gross errors of the church of Rome.\r\n\r\nAdrian, on this account, thirsted for his blood, and made several\r\nattempts to get him into his hands; but Arnold, for a long time, avoided\r\nevery snare laid for him. At length, Frederic Barbarossa arriving at the\r\nimperial dignity, requested that the pope would crown him with his own\r\nhand. This Adrian complied with, and at the same time asked a favour of\r\nthe emperor, which was, to put Arnold into his hands. The emperor very\r\nreadily delivered up the unfortunate preacher, who soon fell a martyr to\r\nAdrian's vengeance, being hanged, and his body burnt to ashes, at\r\nApulia. The same fate attended several of his old friends and\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nEncenas, a Spaniard, was sent to Rome, to be brought up in the Roman\r\ncatholic faith; but having conversed with some of the reformed, and read\r\nseveral treatises which they had put into his hands, he became a\r\nprotestant. This, at length, being known, one of his own relations\r\ninformed against him, when he was burnt by order of the pope, and a\r\nconclave of cardinals. The brother of Encenas had been taken up much\r\nabout the same time, for having a New Testament, in the Spanish\r\nlanguage, in his possession; but before the time appointed for his\r\nexecution, he found means to escape out of prison, and retired to\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nFaninus, a learned layman, by reading controversial books, became of the\r\nreformed religion. An information being exhibited against him to the\r\npope, he was apprehended, and cast into prison. His wife, children,\r\nrelations and friends, visited him in his confinement, and so far\r\nwrought upon his mind, that he renounced his faith, and obtained his\r\nrelease. But he was no sooner free from confinement, than his mind felt\r\nthe heaviest of chains; the weight of a guilty conscience. His horrors\r\nwere so great, that he found them insupportable, till he had returned\r\nfrom his apostacy, and declared himself fully convinced of the errors\r\nof the church of Rome. To make amends for his falling off, he now openly\r\nand strenuously did all he could to make converts to protestantism, and\r\nwas pretty successful in his endeavours. These proceedings occasioned\r\nhis second imprisonment, but he had his life offered him if he would\r\nrecant again. This proposal he rejected with disdain, saying, that he\r\nscorned life upon such terms. Being asked why he would obstinately\r\npersist in his opinions and leave his wife and children in distress, he\r\nreplied, I shall not leave them in distress; I have recommended them to\r\nthe care of an excellent trustee. What trustee? said the person who had\r\nasked the question, with some surprise: to which Faninus answered, Jesus\r\nChrist is the trustee I mean, and I think I could not commit them to the\r\ncare of a better. On the day of execution he appeared remarkably\r\ncheerful, which one observing, said, it is strange you should appear so\r\nmerry upon such an occasion, when Jesus Christ himself, just before his\r\ndeath, was in such agonies, that he sweated blood and water. To which\r\nFaninus replied; Christ sustained all manner of pangs and conflicts,\r\nwith hell and death, on our accounts; and thus, by his sufferings, freed\r\nthose who really believe in him from the fear of them. He was then\r\nstrangled, and his body being burnt to ashes, they were scattered about\r\nby the wind.\r\n\r\nDominicus, a learned soldier, having read several controversial\r\nwritings, became a zealous protestant, and retiring to Placentia, he\r\npreached the gospel in its utmost purity, to a very considerable\r\ncongregation. At the conclusion of his sermon one day, he said, \"If the\r\ncongregation will attend to-morrow, I will give them a description of\r\nAnti-christ, and paint him out in his proper colours.\"\r\n\r\nA vast concourse of people attended the next day, but just as Dominicus\r\nwas beginning his sermon, a civil magistrate went up to the pulpit, and\r\ntook him into custody. He readily submitted; but as he went along with\r\nthe magistrate, made use of this expression: I wonder the devil hath let\r\nme alone so long. When he was brought to examination, this question was\r\nput to him: Will you renounce your doctrines? To which he replied: My\r\ndoctrines! I maintain no doctrines of my own; what I preach are the\r\ndoctrines of Christ, and for those I will forfeit my blood, and even\r\nthink myself happy to suffer for the sake of my Redeemer. Every method\r\nwas taken to make him recant from his faith, and embrace the errors of\r\nthe church of Rome; but when persuasions and menaces were found\r\nineffectual, he was sentenced to death, and hanged in the market-place.\r\n\r\nGaleacius, a protestant gentleman, who resided near the castle of St.\r\nAngelo, was apprehended on account of his faith. Great endeavours being\r\nused by his friends he recanted, and subscribed to several of the\r\nsuperstitious doctrines propagated by the church of Rome. Becoming,\r\nhowever, sensible of his error, he publicly renounced his recantation.\r\nBeing apprehended for this, he was condemned to be burnt, and agreeable\r\nto the order, was chained to a stake, where he was left several hours\r\nbefore the fire was put to the faggots, in order that his wife,\r\nrelations, and friends, who surrounded him, might induce him to give up\r\nhis opinions. Galeacius, however, retained his constancy of mind, and\r\nentreated the executioner to put fire to the wood that was to burn him.\r\nThis at length he did, and Galeacius was soon consumed in the flames,\r\nwhich burnt with amazing rapidity and deprived him of sensation in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nSoon after this gentleman's death, a great number of protestants were\r\nput to death in various parts of Italy, on account of their faith,\r\ngiving a sure proof of their sincerity in their martyrdoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An account of the Persecutions of Calabria._\r\n\r\nIn the 14th century, many of the Waldenses of Pragela and Dauphiny,\r\nemigrated to Calabria, and settling some waste lands, by the permission\r\nof the nobles of that country, they soon, by the most industrious\r\ncultivation, made several wild and barren spots appear with all the\r\nbeauties of verdure and fertility.\r\n\r\nThe Calabrian lords were highly pleased with their new subjects and\r\ntenants, as they were honest, quiet, and industrious; but the priests of\r\nthe country exhibited several negative complaints against them; for not\r\nbeing able to accuse them of anything bad which they did do, they\r\nfounded accusations on what they did not do, and charged them,\r\n\r\nWith not being Roman catholics.\r\n\r\nWith not making any of their boys priests.\r\n\r\nWith not making any of their girls nuns.\r\n\r\nWith not going to mass.\r\n\r\nWith not giving wax tapers to their priests as offerings.\r\n\r\nWith not going on pilgrimages.\r\n\r\nWith not bowing to images.\r\n\r\nThe Calabrian lords, however, quieted the priests, by telling them that\r\nthese people were extremely harmless; that they gave no offence to the\r\nRoman catholics, and cheerfully paid the tithes to the priests, whose\r\nrevenues were considerably increased by their coming into the country,\r\nand who, of consequence, ought to be the last persons to complain of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThings went on tolerably well after this for a few years, during which\r\nthe Waldenses formed themselves into two corporate towns, annexing\r\nseveral villages to the jurisdiction of them. At length, they sent to\r\nGeneva for two clergymen; one to preach in each town, as they determined\r\nto make a public profession of their faith. Intelligence of this affair\r\nbeing carried to the pope, Pius the Fourth, he determined to exterminate\r\nthem from Calabria.\r\n\r\nTo this end he sent cardinal Alexandrino, a man of very violent temper\r\nand a furious bigot, together with two monks, to Calabria, where they\r\nwere to act as inquisitors. These authorized persons came to St. Xist,\r\none of the towns built by the Waldenses, and having assembled the people\r\ntold them, that they should receive no injury or violence, if they would\r\naccept of preachers appointed by the pope; but if they would not, they\r\nshould be deprived both of their properties and lives; and that their\r\nintentions might be known, mass should be publicly said that afternoon,\r\nat which they were ordered to attend.\r\n\r\nThe people of St. Xist, instead of attending mass, fled into the woods,\r\nwith their families, and thus disappointed the cardinal and his\r\ncoadjutors. The cardinal then proceeded to La Garde, the other town\r\nbelonging to the Waldenses, where, not to be served as he had been at\r\nSt. Xist, he ordered the gates to be locked, and all avenues guarded.\r\nThe same proposals were then made to the inhabitants of La Garde, as had\r\npreviously been offered to those of St. Xist, but with this additional\r\npiece of artifice: the cardinal assured them that the inhabitants of St.\r\nXist had immediately come into his proposals, and agreed that the pope\r\nshould appoint them preachers. This falsehood succeeded; for the people\r\nof La Garde, thinking what the cardinal had told them to be the truth,\r\nsaid they would exactly follow the example of their brethren at St.\r\nXist.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal having gained his point by deluding the people of one town,\r\nsent for troops of soldiers, with a view to murder those of the other.\r\nHe, accordingly, despatched the soldiers into the woods, to hunt down\r\nthe inhabitants of St. Xist like wild beasts, and gave them strict\r\norders to spare neither age nor sex, but to kill all they came near. The\r\ntroops entered the woods, and many fell a prey to their ferocity, before\r\nthe Waldenses were properly apprised of their design. At length,\r\nhowever, they determined to sell their lives as dear as possible, when\r\nseveral conflicts happened, in which the half-armed Waldenses performed\r\nprodigies of valour, and many were slain on both sides. The greatest\r\npart of the troops being killed in the different rencontres, the rest\r\nwere compelled to retreat, which so enraged the cardinal, that he wrote\r\nto the viceroy of Naples for reinforcements.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy immediately ordered a proclamation to be made throughout all\r\nthe Neapolitan territories, that all outlaws, deserters, and other\r\nproscribed persons should be surely pardoned for their respective\r\noffences, on condition of making a campaign against the inhabitants of\r\nSt. Xist, and continuing under arms till those people were exterminated.\r\n\r\nMany persons of desperate fortunes, came in upon this proclamation, and\r\nbeing formed into light companies, were sent to scour the woods, and put\r\nto death all they could meet with of the reformed religion. The viceroy\r\nhimself likewise joined the cardinal, at the head of a body of regular\r\nforces; and, in conjunction, they did all they could to harass the poor\r\npeople in the woods. Some they caught and hanged up upon trees, cut down\r\nboughs and burnt them, or ripped them open and left their bodies to be\r\ndevoured by wild beasts, or birds of prey. Many they shot at a distance,\r\nbut the greatest number they hunted down by way of sport. A few hid\r\nthemselves in caves, but famine destroyed them in their retreat; and\r\nthus all these poor people perished, by various means, to glut the\r\nbigoted malice of their merciless persecutors.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of St. Xist were no sooner exterminated, than those of\r\nLa Garde engaged the attention of the cardinal and viceroy.\r\n\r\nIt was offered, that if they should embrace the Roman catholic\r\npersuasion, themselves and families should not be injured, but their\r\nhouses and properties should be restored, and none would be permitted to\r\nmolest them; but, on the contrary, if they refused this mercy, (as it\r\nwas termed) the utmost extremities would be used, and the most cruel\r\ndeaths the certain consequence of their non-compliance.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the promises on one side, and menaces on the other,\r\nthese worthy people unanimously refused to renounce their religion, or\r\nembrace the errors of popery. This exasperated the cardinal and viceroy\r\nso much, that 30 of them were ordered to be put immediately to the rack,\r\nas a terror to the rest.\r\n\r\nThose who were put to the rack were treated with such severity, that\r\nseveral died under the tortures; one Charlin, in particular, was so\r\ncruelly used, that his belly burst, his bowels came out, and he expired\r\nin the greatest agonies. These barbarities, however, did not answer the\r\npurposes for which they were intended; for those who remained alive\r\nafter the rack, and those who had not felt the rack, remained equally\r\nconstant in their faith, and boldly declared, that no tortures of body,\r\nor terrors of mind, should ever induce them to renounce their God, or\r\nworship images.\r\n\r\nSeveral were then, by the cardinal's order, stripped stark naked, and\r\nwhipped to death with iron rods; and some were hacked to pieces with\r\nlarge knives; others were thrown down from the top of a large tower, and\r\nmany were covered over with pitch, and burnt alive.\r\n\r\nOne of the monks who attended the cardinal, being naturally of a savage\r\nand cruel disposition, requested of him that he might shed some of the\r\nblood of these poor people with his own hands; when his request being\r\ngranted, the barbarous man took a large sharp knife, and cut the throats\r\nof fourscore men, women, and children, with as little remorse as a\r\nbutcher would have killed so many sheep. Every one of these bodies were\r\nthen ordered to be quartered, the quarters placed upon stakes, and then\r\nfixed in different parts of the country, within a circuit of 30 miles.\r\n\r\nThe four principal men of La Garde were hanged, and the clergyman was\r\nthrown from the top of his church steeple. He was terribly mangled, but\r\nnot quite killed by the fall; at which time the viceroy passing by,\r\nsaid, is the dog yet living? Take him up, and give him to the hogs,\r\nwhen, brutal as this sentence may appear, it was executed accordingly.\r\n\r\nSixty women were racked so violently, that the cords pierced their arms\r\nand legs quite to the bone; when, being remanded to prison, their wounds\r\nmortified, and they died in the most miserable manner. Many others were\r\nput to death by various cruel means; and if any Roman catholic, more\r\ncompassionate than the rest, interceded for any of the reformed, he was\r\nimmediately apprehended, and shared the same fate as a favourer of\r\nheretics.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy being obliged to march back to Naples, on some affairs of\r\nmoment which required his presence, and the cardinal being recalled to\r\nRome, the marquis of Butane was ordered to put the finishing stroke to\r\nwhat they had begun; which he at length effected, by acting with such\r\nbarbarous rigour, that there was not a single person of the reformed\r\nreligion left living in all Calabria.\r\n\r\nThus were a great number of inoffensive and harmless people deprived of\r\ntheir possessions, robbed of their property, driven from their homes,\r\nand, at length, murdered by various means, only because they would not\r\nsacrifice their consciences to the superstitions of others, embrace\r\nidolatrous doctrines which they abhorred, and accept of teachers whom\r\nthey could not believe. Tyranny is of three kinds, viz., that which\r\nenslaves the person, that which seizes the property, and that which\r\nprescribes and dictates to the mind. The two first sorts may be termed\r\ncivil tyranny, and have been practised by arbitrary sovereigns in all\r\nages, who have delighted in tormenting the persons, and stealing the\r\nproperties of their unhappy subjects. But the third sort, viz.\r\nprescribing and dictating to the mind, may be called ecclesiastical\r\ntyranny: and this is the worst kind of tyranny, as it includes the other\r\ntwo sorts; for the Romish clergy not only do torture the bodies and\r\nseize the effects of those they persecute, but take the lives, torment\r\nthe minds, and, if possible, would tyrannize over the souls of the\r\nunhappy victims.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Account of the Persecutions in the Valleys of Piedmont._\r\n\r\nMany of the Waldenses, to avoid the persecutions to which they were\r\ncontinually subjected in France, went and settled in the valleys of\r\nPiedmont, where they increased exceedingly, and flourished very much for\r\na considerable time.\r\n\r\nThough they were harmless in their behaviour, inoffensive in their\r\nconversation, and paid tithes to the Roman clergy, yet the latter could\r\nnot be contented, but wished to give them some disturbance; they,\r\naccordingly, complained to the archbishop of Turin, that the Waldenses\r\nof the valleys of Piedmont were heretics, for these reasons:\r\n\r\n1. That they did not believe in the doctrines of the church of Rome.\r\n\r\n2. That they made no offerings or prayers for the dead.\r\n\r\n3. That they did not go to mass.\r\n\r\n4. That they did not confess, and receive absolution.\r\n\r\n5. That they did not believe in purgatory, or pay money to get the souls\r\nof their friends out of it.\r\n\r\nUpon these charges the archbishop ordered a persecution to be commenced,\r\nand many fell martyrs to the superstitious rage of the priests and\r\nmonks.\r\n\r\nAt Turin, one of the reformed had his bowels torn out, and put in a\r\nbasin before his face, where they remained in his view till he expired.\r\nAt Revel, Catelin Girard being at the stake, desired the executioner to\r\ngive him a stone; which he refused, thinking that he meant to throw it\r\nat somebody; but Girard assuring him that he had no such design, the\r\nexecutioner complied; when Girard, looking earnestly at the stone, said,\r\nWhen it is in the power of a man to eat and digest this solid stone, the\r\nreligion for which I am about to suffer shall have an end, and not\r\nbefore. He then threw the stone on the ground, and submitted cheerfully\r\nto the flames. A great many more of the reformed were oppressed, or put\r\nto death, by various means, till the patience of the Waldenses being\r\ntired out, they flew to arms in their own defence, and formed themselves\r\ninto regular bodies.\r\n\r\nExasperated at this, the bishop of Turin procured a number of troops and\r\nsent against them; but in most of the skirmishes and engagements the\r\nWaldenses were successful, which partly arose from their being better\r\nacquainted with the passes of the valleys of Piedmont than their\r\nadversaries, and partly from the desperation with which they fought; for\r\nthey well knew, if they were taken, they should not be considered as\r\nprisoners of war, but tortured to death as heretics.\r\n\r\nAt length, Philip the seventh, duke of Savoy, and supreme lord of\r\nPiedmont, determined to interpose his authority, and stop these bloody\r\nwars, which so greatly disturbed his dominions. He was not willing to\r\ndisoblige the pope, or affront the archbishop of Turin; nevertheless, he\r\nsent them both messages, importing, that he could not any longer tamely\r\nsee his dominions overrun with troops, who were directed by priests\r\ninstead of officers, and commanded by prelates instead of generals; nor\r\nwould he suffer his country to be depopulated, while he himself had not\r\nbeen even consulted upon the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe priests, finding the resolution of the duke, did all they could to\r\nprejudice his mind against the Waldenses; but the duke told them, that\r\nthough he was unacquainted with the religious tenets of these people,\r\nyet he had always found them quiet, faithful, and obedient, and\r\ntherefore he determined they should be no longer persecuted.\r\n\r\nThe priests now had recourse to the most palpable and absurd falsehoods:\r\nthey assured the duke that he was mistaken in the Waldenses for they\r\nwere a wicked set of people, and highly addicted to intemperance,\r\nuncleanness, blasphemy, adultery, incest, and many other abominable\r\ncrimes; and that they were even monsters in nature, for their children\r\nwere born with black throats, with four rows of teeth, an bodies all\r\nover hairy.\r\n\r\nThe duke was not so devoid of common sense as to give credit to what the\r\npriests said, though they affirmed in the most solemn manner the truth\r\nof their assertions. He, however, sent twelve very learned and sensible\r\ngentlemen into the Piedmontese valleys, to examine into the real\r\ncharacters of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen, after travelling through all their towns and villages,\r\nand conversing with people of every rank among the Waldenses returned\r\nto the duke, and gave him the most favourable account of those people;\r\naffirming, before the faces of the priests who villified them, that they\r\nwere harmless, inoffensive, loyal, friendly, industrious, and pious:\r\nthat they abhorred the crimes of which they were accused; and that,\r\nshould an individual, through his depravity, fall into any of those\r\ncrimes, he would, by their laws, be punished in the most exemplary\r\nmanner. With respect to the children, the gentlemen said, the priests\r\nhad told the most gross and ridiculous falsities, for they were neither\r\nborn with black throats, teeth in their mouths, nor hair on their\r\nbodies, but were as fine children as could be seen. \"And to convince\r\nyour highness of what we have said, (continued one of the gentlemen), we\r\nhave brought twelve of the principal male inhabitants, who are come to\r\nask pardon in the name of the rest, for having taken up arms without\r\nyour leave, though even in their own defence, and to preserve their\r\nlives from their merciless enemies. And we have likewise brought several\r\nwomen, with children of various ages, that your highness may have an\r\nopportunity of personally examining them as much as you please.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke, after accepting the apology of the twelve delegates,\r\nconversing with the women, and examining the children, graciously\r\ndismissed them. He then commanded the priests, who had attempted to\r\nmislead him, immediately to leave the court; and gave strict orders,\r\nthat the persecution should cease throughout his dominions.\r\n\r\nThe Waldenses had enjoyed peace many years, when Philip, the seventh\r\nduke of Savoy, died, and his successor happened to be a very bigoted\r\npapist. About the same time, some of the principal Waldenses proposed,\r\nthat their clergy should preach in public, that every one might know the\r\npurity of their doctrines: for hitherto they had preached only in\r\nprivate, and to such congregations as they well knew to consist of none\r\nbut persons of the reformed religion.\r\n\r\nOn hearing these proceedings, the new duke was greatly exasperated, and\r\nsent a considerable body of troops into the valleys, swearing that if\r\nthe people would not change their religion, he would have them flayed\r\nalive. The commander of the troops soon found the impracticability of\r\nconquering them with the number of men he had with him, he, therefore,\r\nsent word to the duke, that the idea of subjugating the Waldenses, with\r\nso small a force, was ridiculous; that those people were better\r\nacquainted with the country than any that were with him; that they had\r\nsecured all the passes, were well armed, and resolutely determined to\r\ndefend themselves; and, with respect to flaying them alive, he said,\r\nthat every skin belonging to those people would cost him the lives of a\r\ndozen of his subjects.\r\n\r\nTerrified at this information, the duke withdrew the troops, determining\r\nto act not by force, but by stratagem. He, therefore, ordered rewards\r\nfor the taking of any of the Waldenses, who might be found straying from\r\ntheir places of security; and these, when taken, were either flayed\r\nalive, or burnt.\r\n\r\nThe Waldenses had hitherto only had the new Testament and a few books\r\nof the Old, in the Waldensian tongue; but they determined now to have\r\nthe sacred writings complete in their own language. They, therefore,\r\nemployed a Swiss printer to furnish them with a complete edition of the\r\nOld and New Testaments in the Waldensian tongue, which he did for the\r\nconsideration of fifteen hundred crowns of gold, paid him by those pious\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nPope Paul the third, a bigoted papist, ascending the pontifical chair,\r\nimmediately solicited the parliament of Turin to persecute the\r\nWaldenses, as the most pernicious of all heretics.\r\n\r\nThe parliament readily agreed, when several were suddenly apprehended\r\nand burnt by their order. Among these was Bartholomew Hector, a\r\nbookseller and stationer of Turin, who was brought up a Roman catholic,\r\nbut having read some treatises written by the reformed clergy, he was\r\nfully convinced of the errors of the church of Rome; yet his mind was,\r\nfor some time, wavering, and he hardly knew what persuasion to embrace.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, he fully embraced the reformed religion, and was\r\napprehended, as we have already mentioned, and burnt by order of the\r\nparliament of Turin.\r\n\r\nA consultation was now held by the parliament of Turin, in which it was\r\nagreed to send deputies to the valleys of Piedmont, with the following\r\npropositions:\r\n\r\n1. That if the Waldenses would come to the bosom of the church of Rome,\r\nand embrace the Roman catholic religion, they should enjoy their houses,\r\nproperties and lands, and live with their families, without the least\r\nmolestation.\r\n\r\n2. That to prove their obedience, they should send twelve of their\r\nprincipal persons, with all their ministers and schoolmasters, to Turin,\r\nto be dealt with at discretion.\r\n\r\n3. That the pope, the king of France, and the duke of Savoy, approved\r\nof, and authorized the proceedings of the parliament of Turin, upon this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n4. That if the Waldenses of the valleys of Piedmont, refused to comply\r\nwith these propositions, persecution should ensue, and certain death be\r\ntheir portion.\r\n\r\nTo each of these propositions the Waldenses nobly replied in the\r\nfollowing manner, answering them respectively:\r\n\r\n1. That no considerations whatever should make them renounce their\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n2. That they would never consent to commit their best and most\r\nrespectable friends, to the custody and discretion of their worst and\r\nmost inveterate enemies.\r\n\r\n3. That they valued the approbation of the King of kings, who reigns in\r\nheaven, more than any temporal authority.\r\n\r\n4. That their souls were more precious than their bodies.\r\n\r\nThese pointed and spirited replies greatly exasperated the parliament of\r\nTurin; they continued, with more avidity than ever, to kidnap such\r\nWaldenses as did not act with proper precaution, who were sure to\r\nsuffer the most cruel deaths. Among these, it unfortunately happened,\r\nthat they got hold of Jeffery Varnagle, minister of Angrogne, whom they\r\ncommitted to the flames as a heretic.\r\n\r\nThey then solicited a considerable body of troops of the king of France,\r\nin order to exterminate the reformed entirely from the valleys of\r\nPiedmont; but just as the troops were going to march, the protestant\r\nprinces of Germany interposed, and threatened to send troops to assist\r\nthe Waldenses, if they should be attacked. The king of France, not\r\ncaring to enter into a war, remanded the troops, and sent word to the\r\nparliament of Turin, that he could not spare any troops at present to\r\nact in Piedmont. The members of the parliament were greatly vexed at\r\nthis disappointment, and the persecution gradually ceased, for as they\r\ncould only put to death such of the reformed as they caught by chance,\r\nand as the Waldenses daily grew more cautious, their cruelty was obliged\r\nto subside, for want of objects on whom to exercise it.\r\n\r\nAfter the Waldenses had enjoyed a few years tranquility, they were again\r\ndisturbed by the following means: the pope's nuncio coming to Turin to\r\nthe duke of Savoy upon business, told that prince, he was astonished he\r\nhad not yet either rooted out the Waldenses from the valleys of Piedmont\r\nentirely, or compelled them to enter into the bosom of the church of\r\nRome. That he could not help looking upon such conduct with a suspicious\r\neye, and that he really thought him a favourer of those heretics, and\r\nshould report the affair accordingly to his holiness the pope.\r\n\r\nStung by this reflection, and unwilling to be misrepresented to the\r\npope, the duke determined to act with the greatest severity, in order to\r\nshow his zeal, and to make amends for former neglect by future cruelty.\r\nHe, accordingly, issued express orders for all the Waldenses to attend\r\nmass regularly on pain of death. This they absolutely refused to do, on\r\nwhich he entered the Piedmontese valleys, with a formidable body of\r\ntroops, and began a most furious persecution, in which great numbers\r\nwere hanged, drowned, ripped open, tied to trees, and pierced with\r\nprongs, thrown from precipices, burnt, stabbed, racked to death,\r\ncrucified with their heads downwards, worried by dogs, &c.\r\n\r\nThese who fled had their goods plundered, and their houses burnt to the\r\nground: they were particularly cruel when they caught a minister or a\r\nschoolmaster, whom they put to such exquisite tortures, as are almost\r\nincredible to conceive. If any whom they took seemed wavering in their\r\nfaith, they did not put them to death, but sent them to the galleys, to\r\nbe made converts by dint of hardships.\r\n\r\nThe most cruel persecutors, upon this occasion, that attended the duke,\r\nwere three in number, viz. 1. Thomas Incomel, an apostate, for he was\r\nbrought up in the reformed religion, but renounced his faith, embraced\r\nthe errors of popery, and turned monk. He was a great libertine, given\r\nto unnatural crimes, and sordidly solicitous for plunder of the\r\nWaldenses. 2. Corbis, a man of a very ferocious and cruel nature, whose\r\nbusiness was to examine the prisoners.--3. The provost of justice, who\r\nwas very anxious for the execution of the Waldenses, as every execution\r\nput money in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThese three persons were unmerciful to the last degree; and wherever\r\nthey came, the blood of the innocent was sure to flow. Exclusive of the\r\ncruelties exercised by the duke, by these three persons, and the army,\r\nin their different marches, many local barbarities were committed. At\r\nPignerol, a town in the valleys, was a monastery, the monks of which,\r\nfinding they might injure the reformed with impunity, began to plunder\r\nthe houses and pull down the churches of the Waldenses. Not meeting with\r\nany opposition, they seized upon the persons of those unhappy people,\r\nmurdering the men, confining the women, and putting the children to\r\nRoman catholic nurses.\r\n\r\nThe Roman catholic inhabitants of the valley in St. Martin, likewise,\r\ndid all they could to torment the neighbouring Waldenses: they destroyed\r\ntheir churches, burnt their houses, seized their properties, stole their\r\ncattle, converted their lands to their own use, committed their\r\nministers to the flames, and drove the Waldenses to the woods, where\r\nthey had nothing to subsist on but wild fruits, roots, the bark of\r\ntrees, &c.\r\n\r\nSome Roman catholic ruffians having seized a minister as he was going to\r\npreach, determined to take him to a convenient place, and burn him. His\r\nparishioners having intelligence of this affair, the men armed\r\nthemselves, pursued the ruffians, and seemed determined to rescue their\r\nminister; which the ruffians no sooner perceived than they stabbed the\r\npoor gentleman, and leaving him weltering in his blood, made a\r\nprecipitate retreat. The astonished parishioners did all they could to\r\nrecover him, but in vain; for the weapon had touched the vital parts,\r\nand he expired as they were carrying him home.\r\n\r\nThe monks of Pignerol having a great inclination to get the minister of\r\na town in the valleys, called St. Germain, into their power, hired a\r\nband of ruffians for the purpose of apprehending him. These fellows were\r\nconducted by a treacherous person, who had formerly been a servant to\r\nthe clergyman, and who perfectly well knew a secret way to the house, by\r\nwhich he could lead them without alarming the neighbourhood. The guide\r\nknocked at the door, and being asked who was there, answered in his own\r\nname. The clergyman, not expecting any injury from a person on whom he\r\nhad heaped favours, immediately opened the door; but perceiving the\r\nruffians, he started back, and fled to a back door; but they rushed in,\r\nfollowed, and seized him. Having murdered all his family, they made him\r\nproceed towards Pignerol, goading him all the way with pikes, lances,\r\nswords, &c. He was kept a considerable time in prison, and then fastened\r\nto the stake to be burnt; when two women of the Waldenses, who had\r\nrenounced their religion to save their lives, were ordered to carry\r\nfagots to the stake to burn him; and as they laid them down, to say,\r\nTake these, thou wicked heretic, in recompense for the pernicious\r\ndoctrines thou hast taught us. These words they both repeated to him to\r\nwhich he calmly replied, I formerly taught you well, but you have since\r\nlearned ill. The fire was then put to the fagots, and he was speedily\r\nconsumed, calling upon the name of the Lord as long as his voice\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nAs the troops of ruffians, belonging to the monks, did great mischief\r\nabout the town of St. Germain, murdering and plundering many of the\r\ninhabitants, the reformed of Lucerne and Angrogne, sent some bands of\r\narmed men to the assistance of their brethren of St. Germain. These\r\nbodies of armed men frequently attacked the ruffians, and often put them\r\nto the rout, which so terrified the monks, that they left the monastery\r\nof Pignerol for some time, till they could procure a body of regular\r\ntroops to guard them.\r\n\r\nThe duke not thinking himself so successful as he at first imagined he\r\nshould be, greatly augmented his forces; ordered the bands of ruffians,\r\nbelonging to the monks, should join him; and commanded, that a general\r\njail-delivery should take place, provided the persons released would\r\nbear arms, and form themselves into light companies, to assist in the\r\nextermination of the Waldenses.\r\n\r\nThe Waldenses, being informed of the proceedings, secured as much of\r\ntheir properties as they could, and quitting the valleys, retired to the\r\nrocks and caves among the Alps; for it is to be understood, that the\r\nvalleys of Piedmont are situated at the foot of those prodigious\r\nmountains called the Alps, or the Alpine hills.\r\n\r\nThe army now began to plunder and burn the towns and villages wherever\r\nthey came; but the troops could not force the passes to the Alps, which\r\nwere gallantly defended by the Waldenses, who always repulsed their\r\nenemies: but if any fell into the hands of the troops, they were sure to\r\nbe treated with the most barbarous severity.\r\n\r\nA soldier having caught one of the Waldenses, bit his right ear off,\r\nsaying, I will carry this member of that wicked heretic with me into my\r\nown country, and preserve it as a rarity. He then stabbed the man and\r\nthrew him into a ditch.\r\n\r\nA party of the troops found a venerable man, upwards of a hundred years\r\nof age, together with his grand-daughter, a maiden, of about eighteen,\r\nin a cave. They butchered the poor old man in the most inhuman manner,\r\nand then attempted to ravish the girl, when she started away and fled\r\nfrom them; but they pursuing her, she threw herself from a precipice and\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nThe Waldenses, in order the more effectually to be able to repel force\r\nby force, entered into a league with the protestant powers of Germany,\r\nand with the reformed of Dauphiny and Pragela. These were respectively\r\nto furnish bodies of troops; and the Waldenses determined, when thus\r\nreinforced, to quit the mountains of the Alps, (where they must soon\r\nhave perished, as the winter was coming on,) and to force the duke's\r\narmy to evacuate their native valleys.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Savoy was now tired of the war; it had cost him great\r\nfatigue and anxiety of mind, a vast number of men, and very\r\nconsiderable sums of money. It had been much more tedious and bloody\r\nthan he expected, as well as more expensive than he could at first have\r\nimagined, for he thought the plunder would have discharged the expenses\r\nof the expedition; but in this he was mistaken, for the pope's nuncio,\r\nthe bishops, monks, and other ecclesiastics, who attended the army and\r\nencouraged the war, sunk the greatest part of the wealth that was taken\r\nunder various pretences. For these reasons, and the death of his\r\nduchess, of which he had just received intelligence, and fearing that\r\nthe Waldenses, by the treaties they had entered into, would become more\r\npowerful than ever, he determined to return to Turin with his army, and\r\nto make peace with the Waldenses.\r\n\r\nThis resolution he executed, though greatly against the will of the\r\necclesiastics, who were the chief gainers, and the best pleased with\r\nrevenge. Before the articles of peace could be ratified, the duke\r\nhimself died, soon after his return to Turin; but on his death-bed he\r\nstrictly enjoined his son to perform what he intended, and to be as\r\nfavourable as possible to the Waldenses.\r\n\r\nThe duke's son, Charles Emmanuel, succeeded to the dominions of Savoy,\r\nand gave a full ratification of peace to the Waldenses, according to the\r\nlast injunctions of his father, though the ecclesiastics did all they\r\ncould to persuade him to the contrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An account of the Persecutions in Venice._\r\n\r\nWhile the state of Venice was free from inquisitors, a great number of\r\nprotestants fixed their residence there, and many converts were made by\r\nthe purity of the doctrines they professed, and the inoffensiveness of\r\nthe conversation they used.\r\n\r\nThe pope being informed of the great increase of protestantism, in the\r\nyear 1512 sent inquisitors to Venice to make an inquiry into the matter,\r\nand apprehend such as they might deem obnoxious persons. Hence a severe\r\npersecution began, and many worthy persons were martyred for serving God\r\nwith purity, and scorning the trappings of idolatry.\r\n\r\nVarious were the modes by which the protestants were deprived of life;\r\nbut one particular method, which was first invented upon this occasion,\r\nwe shall describe; as soon as sentence was passed, the prisoner had an\r\niron chain which ran through a great stone fastened to his body. He was\r\nthen laid flat upon a plank, with his face upwards, and rowed between\r\ntwo boats to a certain distance at sea, when the two boats separated,\r\nand he was sunk to the bottom by the weight of the stone.\r\n\r\nIf any denied the jurisdiction of the inquisitors at Venice, they were\r\nsent to Rome, where, being committed purposely to damp prisons, and\r\nnever called to a hearing, their flesh mortified, and they died\r\nmiserably in jail.\r\n\r\nA citizen of Venice, Anthony Ricetti, being apprehended as a\r\nprotestant, was sentenced to be drowned in the manner we have already\r\ndescribed. A few days previous to the time appointed for his execution,\r\nhis son went to see him, and begged him to recant, that his wife might\r\nbe saved, and himself not left fatherless. To which the father replied,\r\na good christian is bound to relinquish not only goods and children, but\r\nlife itself, for the glory of his Redeemer: therefore I am resolved to\r\nsacrifice every thing in this transitory world, for the sake of\r\nsalvation in a world that will last to eternity. The lords of Venice\r\nlikewise sent him word, that if he would embrace the Roman catholic\r\nreligion, they would not only give him his life, but redeem a\r\nconsiderable estate which he had mortgaged, and freely present him with\r\nit. This, however, he absolutely refused to comply with, sending word to\r\nthe nobles that he valued his soul beyond all other considerations; and\r\nbeing told that a fellow-prisoner, named Francis Sega, had recanted, he\r\nanswered, if he has forsaken God, I pity him; but I shall continue\r\nsteadfast in my duty. Finding all endeavours to persuade him to renounce\r\nhis faith ineffectual, he was executed according to his sentence, dying\r\ncheerfully, and recommending his soul fervently to the Almighty.\r\n\r\nWhat Ricetti had been told concerning the apostacy of Francis Sega, was\r\nabsolutely false, for he had never offered to recant, but steadfastly\r\npersisted in his faith, and was executed, a few days after Ricetti, in\r\nthe very same manner.\r\n\r\nFrancis Spinola, a protestant gentleman of very great learning, being\r\napprehended by order of the inquisitors, was carried before their\r\ntribunal. A treatise on the Lord's supper was then put into his hands\r\nand he was asked if he knew the author of it. To which he replied, I\r\nconfess myself to be the author of it, and at the same time solemnly\r\naffirm, that there is not a line in it but what is authorized by, and\r\nconsonant to, the holy scriptures. On this confession he was committed\r\nclose prisoner to a dungeon for several days.\r\n\r\nBeing brought to a second examination, he charged the pope's legate, and\r\nthe inquisitors, with being merciless barbarians, and then represented\r\nthe superstitions and idolatries practised by the church of Rome in so\r\nglaring a light, that not being able to refute his arguments, they sent\r\nhim back to his dungeon, to make him repent of what he had said.\r\n\r\nOn his third examination, they asked him if he would recant his errors!\r\nTo which he answered, that the doctrines he maintained were not\r\nerroneous, being purely the same as those which Christ and his apostles\r\nhad taught, and which were handed down to us in the sacred writings. The\r\ninquisitors then sentenced him to be drowned, which was executed in the\r\nmanner already described. He went to meet death with the utmost\r\nserenity, seemed to wish for dissolution, and declaring, that the\r\nprolongation of his life did but tend to retard that real happiness\r\nwhich could only be expected in the world to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An account of several remarkable individuals, who were martyred in\r\ndifferent parts of Italy, on account of their religion._\r\n\r\nJohn Mollius was born at Rome, of reputable parents. At twelve years of\r\nage they placed him in the monastery of Gray Friars, where he made such\r\na rapid progress in arts, sciences, and languages, that at eighteen\r\nyears of age he was permitted to take priest's orders.\r\n\r\nHe was then sent to Ferrara, where, after pursuing his studies six years\r\nlonger, he was made theological reader in the university of that city.\r\nHe now, unhappily, exerted his great talents to disguise the gospel\r\ntruths, and to varnish over the errors of the church of Rome. After some\r\nyears residence in Ferrara, he removed to the university of Bononia,\r\nwhere he became a professor. Having read some treatises written by\r\nministers of the reformed religion, he grew fully sensible of the errors\r\nof popery, and soon became a zealous protestant in his heart.\r\n\r\nHe now determined to expound, accordingly to the purity of the gospel,\r\nSt. Paul's epistle to the Romans, in a regular course of sermons. The\r\nconcourse of people that continually attended his preaching was\r\nsurprising, but when the priests found the tenor of his doctrines, they\r\ndespatched an account of the affair to Rome; when the pope sent a monk,\r\nnamed Cornelius, to Bononia, to expound the same epistle, according to\r\nthe tenets of the church of Rome. The people, however, found such a\r\ndisparity between the two preachers, that the audience of Mollius\r\nincreased, and Cornelius was forced to preach to empty benches.\r\n\r\nCornelius wrote an account of his bad success to the pope, who\r\nimmediately sent an order to apprehend Mollius, who was seized upon\r\naccordingly, and kept in close confinement. The bishop of Bononia sent\r\nhim word that he must recant, or be burnt; but he appealed to Rome, and\r\nwas removed thither.\r\n\r\nAt Rome he begged to have a public trial, but that the pope absolutely\r\ndenied him, and commanded him to give an account of his opinions in\r\nwriting, which he did under the following heads:\r\n\r\nOriginal sin. Free-will. The infallibility of the church of Rome. The\r\ninfallibility of the pope. Justification by faith. Purgatory.\r\nTransubstantiation. Mass. Auricular confession. Prayers for the dead.\r\nThe host. Prayers for saints. Going on pilgrimages. Extreme unction.\r\nPerforming service in an unknown tongue, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nAll these he confirmed from scripture authority. The pope, upon this\r\noccasion, for political reasons, spared him for the present, but soon\r\nafter had him apprehended, and put to death; he being first hanged, and\r\nhis body burnt to ashes, A. D. 1553.\r\n\r\nThe year after, Francis Gamba, a Lombard, of the protestant persuasion,\r\nwas apprehended, and condemned to death by the senate of Milan. At the\r\nplace of execution, a monk presented a cross to him, to whom he said, My\r\nmind is so full of the real merits and goodness of Christ, that I want\r\nnot a piece of senseless stick to put me in mind of him. For this\r\nexpression his tongue was bored through, and he was afterwards burnt.\r\n\r\nA. D. 1555, Algerius, a student in the university of Padua, and a man of\r\ngreat learning, having embraced the reformed religion, did all he could\r\nto convert others. For these proceedings he was accused of heresy to the\r\npope, and being apprehended, was committed to the prison at Venice.\r\n\r\nThe pope, being informed of Algerius's great learning, and surprising\r\nnatural abilities, thought it would be of infinite service to the church\r\nof Rome, if he could induce him to forsake the protestant cause. He,\r\ntherefore, sent for him to Rome, and tried, by the most profane\r\npromises, to win him to his purpose. But finding his endeavours\r\nineffectual, he ordered him to be burnt, which sentence was executed\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nA. D. 1559, John Alloysius, being sent from Geneva to preach in\r\nCalabria, was there apprehended as a protestant, carried to Rome, and\r\nburnt by order of the pope; and James Bovellus, for the same reason, was\r\nburnt at Messina.\r\n\r\nA. D. 1560, pope Pius the Fourth, ordered all the protestants to be\r\nseverely persecuted throughout the Italian states, when great numbers of\r\nevery age, sex, and condition, suffered martyrdom. Concerning the\r\ncruelties practised upon this occasion, a learned and humane Roman\r\ncatholic thus spoke of them, in a letter to a noble lord:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, my lord, forbear disclosing my sentiments, with respect to\r\nthe persecution now carrying on: I think it cruel and unnecessary; I\r\ntremble at the manner of putting to death, as it resembles more the\r\nslaughter of calves and sheep, than the execution of human beings. I\r\nwill relate to your lordship a dreadful scene, of which I was myself an\r\neye-witness: seventy protestants were cooped up in one filthy dungeon\r\ntogether; the executioner went in among them, picked out one from among\r\nthe rest, blindfolded him, led him out to an open place before the\r\nprison, and cut his throat with the greatest composure. He then calmly\r\nwalked into the prison again, bloody as he was, and with the knife in\r\nhis hand selected another, and despatched him in the same manner; and\r\nthis, my lord, he repeated till the whole number were put to death. I\r\nleave it to your lordship's feelings to judge of my sensations upon this\r\noccasion; my tears now wash the paper upon which I give you the recital.\r\nAnother thing I must mention--the patience with which they met death:\r\nthey seemed all resignation and piety, fervently praying to God, and\r\ncheerfully encountering their fate. I cannot reflect without shuddering,\r\nhow the executioner held the bloody knife between his teeth; what a\r\ndreadful figure he appeared, all covered with blood, and with what\r\nunconcern he executed his barbarous office.\"\r\n\r\nA young Englishman who happened to be at Rome, was one day passing by a\r\nchurch, when the procession of the host was just coming out. A bishop\r\ncarried the host, which the young man perceiving, he snatched it from\r\nhim, threw it upon the ground, and trampled it under his feet, crying\r\nout, Ye wretched idolaters, who neglect the true God, to adore a morsel\r\nof bread. This action so provoked the people, that they would have torn\r\nhim to pieces on the spot; but the priests persuaded them to let him\r\nabide by the sentence of the pope.\r\n\r\nWhen the affair was represented to the pope, he was so greatly\r\nexasperated that he ordered the prisoner to be burnt immediately; but a\r\ncardinal dissuaded him from this hasty sentence, saying, it was better\r\nto punish him by slow degrees, and to torture him, that they might find\r\nout if he had been instigated by any particular person to commit so\r\natrocious an act.\r\n\r\nThis being approved, he was tortured with the most exemplary severity,\r\nnotwithstanding which they could only get these words from him, It was\r\nthe will of God that I should do as I did.\r\n\r\nThe pope then passed this sentence upon him.\r\n\r\n1. That he should be led by the executioner, naked to the middle,\r\nthrough the streets of Rome.\r\n\r\n2. That he should wear the image of the devil upon his head.\r\n\r\n3. That his breeches should be painted with the representation of\r\nflames.\r\n\r\n4. That he should have his right hand cut off.\r\n\r\n5. That after having been carried about thus in procession, he should be\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard this sentence pronounced, he implored God to give him\r\nstrength and fortitude to go through it. As he passed through the\r\nstreets he was greatly derided by the people, to whom he said some\r\nsevere things respecting the Romish superstition. But a cardinal, who\r\nattended the procession, overhearing him, ordered him to be gagged.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the church door, where he trampled on the host, the\r\nhangman cut off his right hand, and fixed it on a pole. Then two\r\ntormentors, with flaming torches, scorched and burnt his flesh all the\r\nrest of the way. At the place of execution he kissed the chains that\r\nwere to bind him to the stake. A monk presenting the figure of a saint\r\nto him, he struck it aside, and then being chained to the stake, fire\r\nwas put to the fagots, and he was soon burnt to ashes.\r\n\r\nA little after the last mentioned execution, a venerable old man, who\r\nhad long been a prisoner in the inquisition, was condemned to be burnt,\r\nand brought out for execution. When he was fastened to the stake, a\r\npriest held a crucifix to him, on which he said \"If you do not take that\r\nidol from my sight, you will constrain me to spit upon it.\" The priest\r\nrebuked him for this with great severity; but he bade him remember the\r\nfirst and second commandments, and refrain from idolatry, as God himself\r\nhad commanded. He was then gagged, that he should not speak any more,\r\nand fire being put to the fagots, he suffered martyrdom in the flames.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Persecutions in the Marquisate of Saluces._\r\n\r\nThe Marquisate of Saluces, on the south side of the valleys of Piedmont,\r\nwas in A. D. 1561, principally inhabited by protestants, when the\r\nmarquis, who was proprietor of it, began a persecution against them at\r\nthe instigation of the then pope. He began by banishing the ministers,\r\nand if any of them refused to leave their flocks, they were sure to be\r\nimprisoned, and severely tortured; however, he did not proceed so far as\r\nto put any to death.\r\n\r\nSoon after the marquisate fell into the possession of the duke of Savoy,\r\nwho sent circular letters to all the towns and villages, that he\r\nexpected the people should all conform to go to mass.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Saluces, upon receiving this letter, returned a\r\ngeneral epistle, in answer.\r\n\r\nThe duke, after reading the letter, did not interrupt the protestants\r\nfor some time; but, at length, he sent them word, that they must either\r\nconform to the mass, or leave his dominions in fifteen days. The\r\nprotestants, upon this unexpected edict, sent a deputy to the duke to\r\nobtain its revocation, or at least to have it moderated. But their\r\nremonstrances were in vain, and they were given to understand that the\r\nedict was absolute.\r\n\r\nSome were weak enough to go to mass, in order to avoid banishment, and\r\npreserve their property; others removed, with all their effects, to\r\ndifferent countries; and many neglected the time so long, that they were\r\nobliged to abandon all they were worth, and leave the marquisate in\r\nhaste. Those, who unhappily staid behind, were seized, plundered, and\r\nput to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Persecutions in the Valleys of Piedmont, in the\r\nSeventeenth Century._\r\n\r\nPope Clement the eighth, sent missionaries into the valleys of Piedmont,\r\nto induce the protestants to renounce their religion; and these\r\nmissionaries having erected monasteries in several parts of the valleys,\r\nbecame exceedingly troublesome to those of the reformed, where the\r\nmonasteries appeared, not only as fortresses to curb, but as sanctuaries\r\nfor all such to fly to, as had any ways injured them.\r\n\r\nThe protestants petitioned the duke of Savoy against these missionaries,\r\nwhose insolence and ill-usage were become intolerable; but instead of\r\ngetting any redress, the interest of the missionaries so far prevailed,\r\nthat the duke published a decree, in which he declared, that one witness\r\nshould be sufficient in a court of law against a protestant, and that\r\nany witness, who convicted a protestant of any crime whatever, should be\r\nentitled to one hundred crowns.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily imagined, upon the publication of a decree of this\r\nnature, that many protestants fell martyrs to perjury and avarice; for\r\nseveral villanous papists would swear any thing against the protestants\r\nfor the sake of the reward, and then fly to their own priests for\r\nabsolution from their false oaths. If any Roman catholic, of more\r\nconscience than the rest, blamed these fellows for their atrocious\r\ncrimes, they themselves were in danger of being informed against and\r\npunished as favourers of heretics.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries did all they could to get the books of the protestants\r\ninto their hands, in order to burn them; when the protestants doing\r\ntheir utmost endeavours to conceal their books, the missionaries wrote\r\nto the duke of Savoy, who, for the heinous crime of not surrendering\r\ntheir bibles, prayer-books, and religious treatises, sent a number of\r\ntroops to be quartered on them. These military gentry did great mischief\r\nin the houses of the protestants, and destroyed such quantities of\r\nprovisions, that many families were thereby ruined.\r\n\r\nTo encourage, as much as possible, the apostacy of the protestants, the\r\nduke of Savoy published a proclamation wherein he said, \"To encourage\r\nthe heretics to turn catholics, it is our will and pleasure, and we do\r\nhereby expressly command, that all such as shall embrace the holy Roman\r\ncatholic faith, shall enjoy an exemption, from all and every tax for the\r\nspace of five years, commencing from the day of their conversion.\" The\r\nduke of Savoy likewise established a court, called the council for\r\nextirpating the heretics. This court was to enter into inquiries\r\nconcerning the ancient privileges of the protestant churches, and the\r\ndecrees which had been, from time to time, made in favour of the\r\nprotestants. But the investigation of these things was carried on with\r\nthe most manifest partiality; old charters were wrested to a wrong\r\nsense, and sophistry was used to pervert the meaning of every thing,\r\nwhich tended to favour the reformed.\r\n\r\nAs if these severities were not sufficient, the duke, soon after,\r\npublished another edict, in which he strictly commanded, that no\r\nprotestant should act as a schoolmaster, or tutor, either in public or\r\nprivate, or dare to teach any art, science, or language, directly or\r\nindirectly, to persons of any persuasion whatever.\r\n\r\nThis edict was immediately followed by another, which decreed, that no\r\nprotestant should hold any place of profit, trust, or honour; and to\r\nwind up the whole, the certain token of an approaching persecution came\r\nforth in a final edict, by which it was positively ordered, that all\r\nprotestants should diligently attend mass.\r\n\r\nThe publication of an edict, containing such an injunction, may be\r\ncompared to unfurling the bloody flag; for murder and rapine were sure\r\nto follow. One of the first objects that attracted the notice of the\r\npapists, was Mr. Sebastian Basan, a zealous protestant, who was seized\r\nby the missionaries, confined, tormented for fifteen months, and then\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the persecution, the missionaries employed kidnappers to\r\nsteal away the protestants' children, that they might privately be\r\nbrought up Roman catholics; but now they took away the children by open\r\nforce, and if they met with any resistance, murdered the parents.\r\n\r\nTo give greater vigour to the persecution, the duke of Savoy called a\r\ngeneral assembly of the Roman catholic nobility and gentry when a\r\nsolemn edict was published against the reformed, containing many heads,\r\nand including several reasons for extirpating the protestants among\r\nwhich were the following:\r\n\r\n1. For the preservation of the papal authority.\r\n\r\n2. That the church livings may be all under one mode of government.\r\n\r\n3. To make a union among all parties.\r\n\r\n4. In honour of all the saints, and of the ceremonies of the church of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nThis severe edict was followed by a most cruel order, published on\r\nJanuary 25, A. D. 1655, under the duke's sanction, by Andrew Gastaldo,\r\ndoctor of civil laws. This order set forth, \"That every head of a\r\nfamily, with the individuals of that family, of the reformed religion,\r\nof what rank, degree, or condition soevor, none excepted inhabiting and\r\npossessing estates in Lucerne, St. Giovanni, Bibiana, Campiglione, St.\r\nSecondo, Lucernetta, La Torre, Fenile, and Bricherassio, should, within\r\nthree days after the publication thereof, withdraw and depart, and be\r\nwithdrawn out of the said places, and translated into the places and\r\nlimits tolerated by his highness during his pleasure; particularly\r\nBobbio, Angrogna, Villaro, Rorata, and the county of Bonetti.\r\n\r\n\"And all this to be done on pain of death, and confiscation of house and\r\ngoods, unless within the limited time they turned Roman catholics.\"\r\n\r\nA flight with such speed, in the midst of winter, may be conceived as no\r\nagreeable task, especially in a country almost surrounded by mountains.\r\nThe sudden order affected all, and things, which would have been\r\nscarcely noticed at another time, now appeared in the most conspicuous\r\nlight. Women with child, or women just lain-in, were not objects of pity\r\non this order for sudden removal, for all were included in the command;\r\nand it unfortunately happened, that the winter was remarkably severe and\r\nrigourous.\r\n\r\nThe papists, however, drove the people from their habitations at the\r\ntime appointed, without even suffering them to have sufficient clothes\r\nto cover them; and many perished in the mountains through the severity\r\nof the weather, or for want of food. Some, however, who remained behind\r\nafter the decree was published, met with the severest treatment, being\r\nmurdered by the popish inhabitants, or shot by the troops who were\r\nquartered in the valleys. A particular description of these cruelties is\r\ngiven in a letter, written by a protestant, who was upon the spot, and\r\nwho happily escaped the carnage. \"The army (says he) having got footing,\r\nbecame very numerous, by the addition of a multitude of the neighbouring\r\npopish inhabitants, who finding we were the destined prey of the\r\nplunderers, fell upon us with an impetuous fury. Exclusive of the duke\r\nof Savoy's troops, and the popish inhabitants, there were several\r\nregiments of French auxiliaries, some companies belonging to the Irish\r\nbrigades, and several bands formed of outlaws, smugglers, and prisoners,\r\nwho had been promised pardon and liberty in this world, and absolution\r\nin the next, for assisting to exterminate the protestants from Piedmont.\r\n\r\n\"This armed multitude being encouraged by the Roman catholic bishops and\r\nmonks, fell upon the protestants in a most furious manner. Nothing now\r\nwas to be seen but the face of horror and despair, blood stained the\r\nfloors of the houses, dead bodies bestrewed the streets, groans and\r\ncries were heard from all parts. Some armed themselves, and skirmished\r\nwith the troops; and many, with their families, fled to the mountains.\r\nIn one village they cruelly tormented 150 women and children after the\r\nmen were fled, beheading the women, and dashing out the brains of the\r\nchildren. In the towns of Villaro and Bobbio, most of those who refused\r\nto go to mass, who were upwards of fifteen years of age, they crucified\r\nwith their heads downwards; and the greatest number of those who were\r\nunder that age were strangled.\"\r\n\r\nSarah Rastignole des Vignes, a woman of 60 years of age, being seized by\r\nsome soldiers, they ordered her to say a prayer to some saints, which\r\nshe refusing, they thrust a sickle into her belly, ripped her up, and\r\nthen cut off her head.\r\n\r\nMartha Constantine, a handsome young woman, was treated with great\r\nindecency and cruelty by several of the troops, who first ravished, and\r\nthen killed her, by cutting off her breasts. These they fried, and set\r\nbefore some of their comrades, who ate them without knowing what they\r\nwere. When they had done eating, the others told them what they had made\r\na meal of, in consequence of which a quarrel ensued, swords were drawn,\r\nand a battle took place. Several were killed in the fray, the greater\r\npart of whom were those concerned in the horrid massacre of the woman,\r\nand who had practised such an inhuman deception on their companions.\r\n\r\nSome of the soldiers seized a man of Thrassiniere, and ran the points of\r\ntheir swords through his ears, and through his feet. They then tore off\r\nthe nails of his fingers and toes with red-hot pincers, tied him to the\r\ntail of an ass, and dragged him about the streets; and, finally fastened\r\na cord round his head, which they twisted with a stick in so violent a\r\nmanner as to wring it from his body.\r\n\r\nPeter Symonds, a protestant, of about eighty years of age, was tied neck\r\nand heels, and then thrown down a precipice. In the fall the branch of a\r\ntree caught hold of the ropes that fastened him, and suspended him in\r\nthe midway, so that he languished for several days, and at length\r\nmiserably perished of hunger.\r\n\r\nEsay Garcino, refusing to renounce his religion, was cut into small\r\npieces; the soldiers, in ridicule, saying, they had minced him. A woman,\r\nnamed Armand, had every limb separated from each other, and then the\r\nrespective parts were hung upon a hedge. Two old women were ripped open,\r\nand then left in the fields upon the snow where they perished; and a\r\nvery old woman, who was deformed, had her nose and hands cut off, and\r\nwas left, to bleed to death in that manner.\r\n\r\nA great number of men, women, and children, were flung from the rocks,\r\nand dashed to pieces. Magdalen Bertino, a protestant woman of La Torre,\r\nwas stripped stark naked, her head tied between her legs, and thrown\r\ndown one of the precipices; and Mary Raymondet, of the same town, had\r\nthe flesh sliced from her bones till she expired.\r\n\r\nMagdalen Pilot, of Villaro, was cut to pieces in the cave of Castolus;\r\nAnn Charboniere had one end of a stake thrust up her body; and the other\r\nbeing fixed in the ground, she was left in that manner to perish, and\r\nJacob Perrin the elder, of the church of Villaro, and David, his\r\nbrother, were flayed alive.\r\n\r\nAn inhabitant of La Torre, named Giovanni Andrea Michialm, was\r\napprehended, with four of his children, three of them were hacked to\r\npieces before him, the soldiers asking him, at the death of every child,\r\nif he would renounce his religion which he constantly refused. One of\r\nthe soldiers then took up the last and youngest by the legs, and putting\r\nthe same question to the father he replied as before, when the inhuman\r\nbrute dashed out the child's brains. The father, however, at the same\r\nmoment started from them, and fled: the soldiers fired after him, but\r\nmissed him; and he, by the swiftness of his heels, escaped, and hid\r\nhimself in the Alps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Further Persecutions in the Valleys of Piedmont, in the seventeenth\r\nCentury._\r\n\r\nGiovanni Pelanchion, for refusing to turn papist, was tied by one leg to\r\nthe tail of a mule, and dragged through the streets of Lucerne, amidst\r\nthe acclamations of an inhuman mob, who kept stoning him, and crying\r\nout, He is possessed with the devil, so that, neither stoning, nor\r\ndragging him through the streets, will kill him, for the devil keeps him\r\nalive. They then took him to the river side, chopped off his head, and\r\nleft that and his body unburied, upon the bank of the stream.\r\n\r\nMagdalen, the daughter of Peter Fontaine, a beautiful child of ten years\r\nof age, was ravished and murdered by the soldiers. Another girl of about\r\nthe same age, they roasted alive at Villa Nova; and a poor woman,\r\nhearing the soldiers were coming toward her house, snatched up the\r\ncradle in which her infant son was asleep, and fled toward the woods.\r\nThe soldiers, however, saw and pursued her, when she lightened herself\r\nby putting down the cradle and child, which the soldiers no sooner came\r\nto, than they murdered the infant, and continuing the pursuit, found the\r\nmother in a cave, where they first ravished, and then cut her to pieces.\r\n\r\nJacob Michelino, chief elder of the church of Bobbio, and several other\r\nprotestants, were hung up by means of hooks fixed in their bellies and\r\nleft to expire in the most excruciating tortures.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Rostagnal, a venerable protestant, upwards of fourscore years\r\nof age, had his nose and ears cut off, and slices cut from the fleshy\r\nparts of his body, till he bled to death.\r\n\r\nSeven persons, viz. Daniel Seleagio and his wife, Giovanni Durant,\r\nLodwich Durant, Bartholomew Durant, Daniel Revel, and Paul Reynaud, had\r\ntheir mouths stuffed with gunpowder, which being set fire to, their\r\nheads were blown to pieces.\r\n\r\nJacob Birone, a schoolmaster of Rorata, for refusing to change his\r\nreligion, was stripped quite naked; and after having been very\r\nindecently exposed, had the nails of his toes and fingers torn off with\r\nred-hot pincers, and holes bored through his hands with the point of a\r\ndagger. He then had a cord tied round his middle, and was led through\r\nthe streets with a soldier on each side of him. At every turning the\r\nsoldier on his right hand side cut a gash in his flesh, and the soldier\r\non his left hand side struck him with a bludgeon, both saying, at the\r\nsame instant, Will you go to mass? will you go to mass? He still replied\r\nin the negative to these interrogatories, and being at length taken to\r\nthe bridge, they cut off his head on the balustrades, and threw both\r\nthat and his body into the river.\r\n\r\nPaul Garnier, a very pious protestant, had his eyes put out, was then\r\nflayed alive, and being divided into four parts, his quarters were\r\nplaced on four of the principal houses of Lucerne. He bore all his\r\nsufferings with the most exemplary patience, praised God as long as he\r\ncould speak, and plainly evinced, what confidence and resignation a good\r\nconscience can inspire.\r\n\r\nDaniel Cardon, of Rocappiata, being apprehended by some soldiers, they\r\ncut his head off, and having fried his brains, ate them. Two poor old\r\nblind women, of St. Giovanni, were burnt alive; and a widow of La Torre,\r\nwith her daughter, were driven into the river, and there stoned to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nPaul Giles, on attempting to run away from some soldiers, was shot in\r\nthe neck: they then slit his nose, sliced his chin, stabbed him, and\r\ngave his carcase to the dogs.\r\n\r\nSome of the Irish troops having taken eleven men of Garcigliana\r\nprisoners, they made a furnace red hot, and forced them to push each\r\nother in till they came to the last man, whom they pushed in themselves.\r\n\r\nMichael Gonet, a man of 90, was burnt to death; Baptista Oudri, another\r\nold man, was stabbed; and Bartholomew Frasche had holes made in his\r\nheels, through which ropes being put, he was dragged by them to the\r\njail, where his wounds mortified and killed him.\r\n\r\nMagdalene de la Piere being pursued by some of the soldiers, and taken,\r\nwas thrown down a precipice, and dashed to pieces. Margaret Revella, and\r\nMary Pravillerin, two very old women, were burnt alive; and Michael\r\nBellino, with Ann Bochardno, were beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe son and daughter of a counsellor of Giovanni were rolled down a\r\nsteep hill together, and suffered to perish in a deep pit at the bottom.\r\nA tradesman's family, viz: himself, his wife, and an infant in her arms,\r\nwere cast from a rock, and dashed to pieces; and Joseph Chairet, and\r\nPaul Carniero, were flayed alive.\r\n\r\nCypriania Bustia, being asked if he would renounce his religion and turn\r\nRoman catholic, replied, I would rather renounce life, or turn dog; to\r\nwhich a priest answered, For that expression you shall both renounce\r\nlife, and be given to the dogs. They, accordingly, dragged him to\r\nprison, where he continued a considerable time without food, till he was\r\nfamished; after which they threw his corpse into the street before the\r\nprison, and it was devoured by dogs in the most shocking manner.\r\n\r\nMargaret Saretta was stoned to death, and then thrown into the river;\r\nAntonio Bartina had his head cleft asunder; and Joseph Pont was cut\r\nthrough the middle of his body.\r\n\r\nDaniel Maria, and his whole family, being ill of a fever, several papist\r\nruffians broke into his house, telling him they were practical\r\nphysicians, and would give them all present ease, which they did by\r\nknocking the whole family on the head.\r\n\r\nThree infant children of a protestant, named Peter Fine, were covered\r\nwith snow, and stifled; an elderly widow, named Judith, was beheaded,\r\nand a beautiful young woman was stripped naked, and had a stake driven\r\nthrough her body, of which she expired.\r\n\r\nLucy, the wife of Peter Besson, a woman far gone in her pregnancy, who\r\nlived in one of the villages of the Piedmontese valleys, determined, if\r\npossible, to escape from such dreadful scenes as every where surrounded\r\nher: she, accordingly took two young children, one in each hand, and set\r\noff towards the Alps. But on the third day of the journey she was taken\r\nin labour among the mountains, and delivered of an infant, who perished\r\nthrough the extreme inclemency of the weather, as did the two other\r\nchildren; for all three were found dead by her, and herself just\r\nexpiring, by the person to whom she related the above particulars.\r\n\r\nFrancis Gros, the son of a clergyman, had his flesh slowly cut from his\r\nbody into small pieces, and put into a dish before him; two of his\r\nchildren were minced before his sight; and his wife was fastened to a\r\npost, that she might behold all these cruelties practised on her husband\r\nand offspring. The tormentors, at length, being tired of exercising\r\ntheir cruelties, cut off the heads of both husband and wife, and then\r\ngave the flesh of the whole family to the dogs.\r\n\r\nThe sieur Thomas Margher fled to a cave, when the soldiers shut up the\r\nmouth, and he perished with famine. Judith Revelin, with seven children,\r\nwere barbarously murdered in their beds; and a widow of near fourscore\r\nyears of age, was hewn to pieces by soldiers.\r\n\r\nJacob Roseno was ordered to pray to the saints, which he absolutely\r\nrefused to do: some of the soldiers beat him violently with bludgeons to\r\nmake him comply, but he still refusing, several of them fired at him and\r\nlodged a great many balls in his body. As he was almost expiring, they\r\ncried to him, Will you call upon the saints? Will you pray to the\r\nsaints? To which he answered, No! No! No! when one of the soldiers, with\r\na broad sword, clove his head asunder, and put an end to his sufferings\r\nin this world; for which undoubtedly, he is gloriously rewarded in the\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nA soldier, attempting to ravish a young woman, named Susanna Gacquin,\r\nshe made a stout resistance, and in the struggle pushed him over a\r\nprecipice, when he was dashed to pieces by the fall. His comrades,\r\ninstead of admiring the virtue of the young woman, and applauding her\r\nfor so nobly defending her chastity, fell upon her with their swords,\r\nand cut her to pieces.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Pulhus, a poor peasant of La Torre, being apprehended as a\r\nprotestant by the soldiers, was ordered, by the marquis of Pianesta, to\r\nbe executed in a place near the convent. When he came to the gallows,\r\nseveral monks attended, and did all they could to persuade him to\r\nrenounce his religion. But he told them he never would embrace idolatry,\r\nand that he was happy at being thought worthy to suffer for the name of\r\nChrist. They then put him in mind of what his wife and children, who\r\ndepended upon his labour, would suffer after his decease; to which he\r\nreplied, I would have my wife and children, as well as myself, to\r\nconsider their souls more than their bodies, and the next world before\r\nthis; and with respect to the distress I may leave them in, God is\r\nmerciful, and will provide for them while they are worthy of his\r\nprotection. Finding the inflexibility of this poor man, the monks\r\ncried,--Turn him off, turn him off, which the executioner did almost\r\nimmediately, and the body being afterward cut down, was flung into the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nPaul Clement, an elder of the church of Rossana, being apprehended by\r\nthe monks of a neighbouring monastery, was carried to the market-place\r\nof that town, where some protestants having just been executed by the\r\nsoldiers, he was shown the dead bodies, in order that the sight might\r\nintimidate him. On beholding the shocking subjects, he said, calmly, You\r\nmay kill the body, but you cannot prejudice the soul of a true believer;\r\nbut with respect to the dreadful spectacles which you have here shown\r\nme, you may rest assured, that God's vengeance will overtake the\r\nmurderers of those poor people, and punish them for the innocent blood\r\nthey have spilt. The monks were so exasperated at this reply, that they\r\nordered him to be hung up directly; and while he was hanging, the\r\nsoldiers amused themselves in standing at a distance, and shooting at\r\nthe body as at a mark.\r\n\r\nDaniel Rambaut, of Villaro, the father of a numerous family, was\r\napprehended, and, with several others, committed to prison, in the jail\r\nof Paysana. Here he was visited by several priests, who with continual\r\nimportunities did all they could to persuade him to renounce the\r\nprotestant religion, and turn papist; but this he peremptorily refused,\r\nand the priests finding his resolution, pretended to pity his numerous\r\nfamily, and told him that he might yet have his life, if he would\r\nsubscribe to the belief of the following articles:\r\n\r\n1. The real presence in the host.\r\n\r\n2. Transubstantiation.\r\n\r\n3. Purgatory.\r\n\r\n4. The pope's infallibility.\r\n\r\n5. That masses said for the dead will release souls from purgatory.\r\n\r\n6. That praying to saints will procure the remission of sins.\r\n\r\nM. Rambaut told the priests, that neither his religion, his\r\nunderstanding, nor his conscience, would suffer him to subscribe to any\r\nof the articles, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. That to believe the real presence in the host, is a shocking union of\r\nboth blasphemy and idolatry.\r\n\r\n2. That to fancy the words of consecration perform what the papists call\r\ntransubstantiation, by converting the wafer and wine into the real and\r\nidentical body and blood of Christ, which was crucified, and which\r\nafterward ascended into heaven, is too gross an absurdity for even a\r\nchild to believe, who was come to the least glimmering of reason; and\r\nthat nothing but the most blind superstition could make the Roman\r\ncatholics put a confidence in any thing so completely ridiculous.\r\n\r\n3. That the doctrine of purgatory was more inconsistent and absurd than\r\na fairy tale.\r\n\r\n4. That the pope's being infallible was an impossibility, and the pope\r\narrogantly laid claim to what could belong to God only, as a perfect\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n5. That saying masses for the dead was ridiculous, and only meant to\r\nkeep up a belief in the fable of purgatory, as the fate of all is\r\nfinally decided, on the departure of the soul from the body.\r\n\r\n6. That praying to saints for the remission of sins, is misplacing\r\nadoration; as the saints themselves have occasion for an intercessor in\r\nChrist. Therefore, as God only can pardon our errors, we ought to sue to\r\nhim alone for pardon.\r\n\r\nThe priests were so highly offended at M. Rambaut's answers to the\r\narticles to which they would have had him subscribe, that they\r\ndetermined to shake his resolution by the most cruel method imaginable:\r\nthey ordered one joint of his finger to be cut off every day, till all\r\nhis fingers were gone; they then proceeded in the same manner with his\r\ntoes; afterward they alternately cut off, daily, a hand and a foot; but\r\nfinding that he bore his sufferings with the most admirable patience,\r\nincreased both in fortitude and resignation, and maintained his faith\r\nwith steadfast resolution, and unshaken constancy, they stabbed him to\r\nthe heart, and then gave his body to be devoured by the dogs.\r\n\r\nPeter Gabriola, a protestant gentleman of considerable eminence, being\r\nseized by a troop of soldiers, and refusing to renounce his religion,\r\nthey hung a great number of little bags of gunpowder about his body, and\r\nthen setting fire to them, blew him up.\r\n\r\nAnthony, the son of Samuel Catieris, a poor dumb lad who was extremely\r\ninoffensive, was cut to pieces by a party of the troops; and soon after\r\nthe same ruffians entered the house of Peter Moniriat, and cut off the\r\nlegs of the whole family, leaving them to bleed to death, as they were\r\nunable to assist themselves, or to help each other.\r\n\r\nDaniel Benech being apprehended, had his nose slit, his ears cut off,\r\nand was then divided into quarters, each quarter being hung upon a\r\ntree, and Mary Monino, had her jaw bones broke and was then left to\r\nlanguish till she was famished.\r\n\r\nMary Pelanchion, a handsome widow, belonging to the town of Villaro, was\r\nseized by a party of the Irish brigades, who having beat her cruelly,\r\nand ravished her, dragged her to a high bridge which crossed the river,\r\nand stripped her naked in a most indecent manner, hung her by the legs\r\nto the bridge, with her head downwards towards the water, and then going\r\ninto boats, they fired at her till she expired.\r\n\r\nMary Nigrino, and her daughter who was an idiot, were cut to pieces in\r\nthe woods, and their bodies left to be devoured by wild beasts: Susanna\r\nBales, a widow of Villaro, was immured till she perished through hunger;\r\nand Susanna Calvio running away from some soldiers and hiding herself in\r\na barn, they set fire to the straw and burnt her.\r\n\r\nPaul Armand was hacked to pieces; a child named Daniel Bertino was\r\nburnt; Daniel Michialino had his tongue plucked out, and was left to\r\nperish in that condition; and Andreo Bertino, a very old man, who was\r\nlame, was mangled in a most shocking manner, and at length had his belly\r\nripped open, and his bowels carried about on the point of a halbert.\r\n\r\nConstantia Bellione, a protestant lady, being apprehended on account of\r\nher faith, was asked by a priest if she would renounce the devil and go\r\nto mass; to which she replied, \"I was brought up in a religion, by which\r\nI was always taught to renounce the devil; but should I comply with your\r\ndesire, and go to mass, I should be sure to meet him there in a variety\r\nof shapes.\" The priest was highly incensed at what she said, and told\r\nher to recant, or she should suffer cruelly. The lady, however, boldly\r\nanswered, that she valued not any sufferings he could inflict, and in\r\nspite of all the torments he could invent, she would keep her conscience\r\npure and her faith inviolate. The priest then ordered slices of her\r\nflesh to be cut off from several parts of her body, which cruelty she\r\nbore with the most singular patience, only saying to the priest, what\r\nhorrid and lasting torments will you suffer in hell, for the trifling\r\nand temporary pains which I now endure. Exasperated at this expression,\r\nand willing to stop her tongue, the priest ordered a file of musqueteers\r\nto draw up and fire upon her, by which she was soon despatched, and\r\nsealed her martyrdom with her blood.\r\n\r\nA young woman named Judith Mandon, for refusing to change her religion,\r\nand embrace popery, was fastened to a stake, and sticks thrown at her\r\nfrom a distance, in the very same manner as that barbarous custom which\r\nwas formerly practised on Shrove-Tuesday, of shying at rocks, as it was\r\ntermed. By this inhuman proceeding, the poor creature's limbs were beat\r\nand mangled in a terrible manner, and her brains were at last dashed out\r\nby one of the bludgeons.\r\n\r\nDavid Paglia and Paul Genre, attempting to escape to the Alps, with each\r\nhis son, were pursued and overtaken by the soldiers in a large plain.\r\nHere they hunted them for their diversion, goading them with their\r\nswords, and making them run about till they dropped down with fatigue.\r\nWhen they found that their spirits were quite exhausted, and that they\r\ncould not afford them any more barbarous sport by running, the soldiers\r\nhacked them to pieces, and left their mangled bodies on the spot.\r\n\r\nA young man of Bobbio, named Michael Greve, was apprehended to the town\r\nof La Torre, and being led to the bridge, was thrown over into the\r\nriver. As he could swim very well, he swam down the stream, thinking to\r\nescape, but the soldiers and mob followed on both sides the river, and\r\nkept stoning him, till receiving a blow on one of his temples, he was\r\nstunned, and consequently sunk and was drowned.\r\n\r\nDavid Armand was ordered to lay his head down on a block, when a\r\nsoldier, with a large hammer, beat out his brains. David Baridona being\r\napprehended at Villaro, was carried to La Torre, where, refusing to\r\nrenounce his religion, he was tormented by means of brimstone matches\r\nbeing tied between his fingers and toes, and set fire to; and afterward,\r\nby having his flesh plucked off with red-hot pincers, till he expired;\r\nand Giovanni Barolina, with his wife, were thrown into a pool of\r\nstagnant water, and compelled, by means of pitchforks and stones, to\r\nduck down their heads till they were suffocated.\r\n\r\nA number of soldiers went to the house of Joseph Garniero, and before\r\nthey entered, fired in at the window, to give notice of their approach.\r\nA musket ball entered one of Mrs. Garniero's breasts, as she was\r\nsuckling an infant with the other. On finding their intentions, she\r\nbegged hard that they would spare the life of the infant, which they\r\npromised to do, and sent it immediately to a Roman catholic nurse. They\r\nthen took the husband and hanged him at his own door, and having shot\r\nthe wife through the head, they left her body weltering in its blood,\r\nand her husband hanging on the gallows.\r\n\r\nIsaiah Mondon, an elderly man, and a pious protestant, fled from the\r\nmerciless persecutors to a cleft in a rock, where he suffered the most\r\ndreadful hardships; for, in the midst of the winter he was forced to lay\r\non the bare stone, without any covering; his food was the roots he could\r\nscratch up near his miserable habitation; and the only way by which he\r\ncould procure drink, was to put snow in his mouth till it melted. Here,\r\nhowever, some of the inhuman soldiers found him, and after having beaten\r\nhim unmercifully, they drove him towards Lucerne, goading him with the\r\npoints of their swords.--Being exceedingly weakened by his manner of\r\nliving, and his spirits exhausted by the blows he had received, he fell\r\ndown in the road. They again beat him to make him proceed: when on his\r\nknees, he implored them to put him out of his misery, by despatching\r\nhim. This they at last agreed to do; and one of them stepping up to him\r\nshot him through the head with a pistol, saying, there, heretic, take\r\nthy request.\r\n\r\nMary Revol, a worthy protestant, received a shot in her back, as she was\r\nwalking along the street. She dropped down with the wound, but\r\nrecovering sufficient strength, she raised herself upon her knees, and\r\nlifting her hands towards heaven, prayed in a most fervent manner to the\r\nAlmighty, when a number of soldiers, who were near at hand, fired a\r\nwhole volley of shot at her, many of which took effect, and put an end\r\nto her miseries in an instant.\r\n\r\nSeveral men, women, and children secreted themselves in a large cave,\r\nwhere they continued for some weeks in safety. It was the custom for two\r\nof the men to go when it was necessary, and by stealth procure\r\nprovisions. These were, however, one day watched, by which the cave was\r\ndiscovered, and soon after, a troop of Roman catholics appeared before\r\nit. The papists that assembled upon this occasion were neighbours and\r\nintimate acquaintances of the protestants in the cave; and some of them\r\nwere even related to each other. The protestants, therefore, came out,\r\nand implored them, by the ties of hospitality, by the ties of blood, and\r\nas old acquaintances and neighbours, not to murder them. But\r\nsuperstition overcomes every sensation of nature and humanity; so that\r\nthe papists, blinded by bigotry, told them they could not show any mercy\r\nto heretics, and, therefore, bade them prepare to die. Hearing this, and\r\nknowing the fatal obstinacy of the Roman catholics, the protestants all\r\nfell prostrate, lifted their hands and hearts to heaven, prayed with\r\ngreat sincerity and fervency, and then bowing down, put their faces\r\nclose to the ground, and patiently waited their fate, which was soon\r\ndecided, for the papists fell upon them with unremitting fury, and\r\nhaving cut them to pieces, left the mangled bodies and limbs in the\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Salvagiot, passing by a Roman catholic church, and not taking\r\noff his hat, was followed by some of the congregation, who fell upon and\r\nmurdered him; and Jacob Barrel and his wife, having been taken prisoners\r\nby the earl of St. Secondo, one of the duke of Savoy's officers, he\r\ndelivered them up to the soldiery, who cut off the woman's breasts, and\r\nthe man's nose, and then shot them both through the head.\r\n\r\nAnthony Guigo, a protestant, of a wavering disposition, went to Periero,\r\nwith an intent to renounce his religion and embrace popery. This design\r\nhe communicated to some priests, who highly commended it, and a day was\r\nfixed upon for his public recantation. In the mean time, Anthony grew\r\nfully sensible of his perfidy, and his conscience tormented him so much\r\nnight and day, that he determined not to recant, but to make his escape.\r\nThis he effected, but being soon missed and pursued, he was taken. The\r\ntroops on the way did all they could to bring him back to his design of\r\nrecantation; but finding their endeavours ineffectual, they beat him\r\nviolently on the road, when coming near a precipice, he took an\r\nopportunity of leaping down it, and was dashed to pieces.\r\n\r\nA protestant gentleman, of considerable fortune, at Bobbio, being\r\nnightly provoked by the insolence of a priest, retorted with great\r\nseverity; and among other things, said, that the pope was Antichrist,\r\nmass idolatry, purgatory a farce, and absolution a cheat. To be\r\nrevenged, the priest hired five desperate ruffians, who, the same\r\nevening, broke into the gentleman's house, and seized upon him in a\r\nviolent manner. The gentleman was terribly frightened, fell on his\r\nknees, and implored mercy; but the desperate ruffians despatched him\r\nwithout the least hesitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Narrative of the Piedmontese War._\r\n\r\nThe massacres and murders already mentioned to have been committed in\r\nthe valleys of Piedmont, nearly depopulated most of the towns and\r\nvillages. One place only had not been assaulted, and that was owing to\r\nthe difficulty of approaching it; this was the little commonalty of\r\nRoras, which was situated upon a rock.\r\n\r\nAs the work of blood grew slack in other places, the earl of Christople,\r\none of the duke of Savoy's officers, determined, if possible, to make\r\nhimself master of it; and, with that view, detached three hundred men to\r\nsurprise it secretly.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Roras, however, had intelligence of the approach of\r\nthese troops, when captain Joshua Gianavel, a brave protestant officer,\r\nput himself at the head of a small body of the citizens, and waited in\r\nambush to attack the enemy in a small defile.\r\n\r\nWhen the troops appeared, and had entered the defile, which was the only\r\nplace by which the town could be approached, the protestants kept up a\r\nsmart and well-directed fire against them, and still kept themselves\r\nconcealed behind bushes from the sight of the enemy. A great number of\r\nthe soldiers were killed, and the remainder receiving a continued fire,\r\nand not seeing any to whom they might return it, thought proper to\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nThe members of this little community then sent a memorial to the marquis\r\nof Pianessa, one of the duke's general officers, setting forth, \"That\r\nthey were sorry, upon any occasion, to be under the necessity of taking\r\nup arms; but that the secret approach of a body of troops, without any\r\nreason assigned, or any previous notice sent of the purpose of their\r\ncoming, had greatly alarmed them; that as it was their custom never to\r\nsuffer any of the military to enter their little community, they had\r\nrepelled force by force, and should do so again; but in all other\r\nrespects, they professed themselves dutiful, obedient, and loyal\r\nsubjects to their sovereign, the duke of Savoy.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis of Pianessa, that he might have the better opportunity of\r\ndeluding and surprising the protestants of Roras, sent them word in\r\nanswer, \"That he was perfectly satisfied with their behaviour, for they\r\nhad done right, and even rendered a service to their country, as the men\r\nwho had attempted to pass the defile were not his troops, or sent by\r\nhim, but a band of desperate robbers, who had, for some time, infested\r\nthose parts, and been a terror to the neighbouring country.\" To give a\r\ngreater colour to his treachery, he then published an ambiguous\r\nproclamation seemingly favourable to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nYet, the very day after this plausible proclamation, and specious\r\nconduct, the marquis sent 500 men to possess themselves of Roras, while\r\nthe people, as he thought, were lulled into perfect security by his\r\nspecious behaviour.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gianavel, however, was not to be deceived so easily: he,\r\ntherefore, laid an ambuscade for this body of troops, as he had for the\r\nformer, and compelled him to retire with very considerable loss.\r\n\r\nThough foiled in these, two attempts, the marquis Pianessa determined on\r\na third, which should be still more formidable; but first he imprudently\r\npublished another proclamation, disowning any knowledge of the second\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nSoon after, 700 chosen men were sent upon the expedition, who, in spite\r\nof the fire from the protestants, forced the defile, entered Roras, and\r\nbegan to murder every person they met with, without distinction of age\r\nor sex. The protestant captain Gianavel, at the head of a small body,\r\nthough he had lost the defile, determined to dispute their passage\r\nthrough a fortified pass that led to the richest and best part of the\r\ntown. Here he was successful, by keeping up a continual fire, and by\r\nmeans of his men being all complete marksmen. The Roman catholic\r\ncommander was greatly staggered at this opposition, as he imagined that\r\nhe had surmounted all difficulties. He, however, did his endeavours to\r\nforce the pass, but being able to bring up only twelve men in front at a\r\ntime, and the protestants being secured by a breastwork, he found he\r\nshould be baffled by the handful of men who opposed him.\r\n\r\nEnraged at the loss of so many of his troops, and fearful of disgrace if\r\nhe persisted in attempting what appeared so impracticable, he thought it\r\nthe wisest thing to retreat. Unwilling, however, to withdraw his men by\r\nthe defile at which he had entered, on account of the difficulty and\r\ndanger of the enterprise, he determined to retreat towards Villaro, by\r\nanother pass called Piampra, which, though hard of access, was easy of\r\ndescent. But in this he met with a disappointment, for captain Gianavel\r\nhaving posted his little band here, greatly annoyed the troops as they\r\npassed, and even pursued their rear till they entered the open country.\r\n\r\nThe marquis of Pianessa, finding that all his attempts were frustrated,\r\nand that every artifice he used was only an alarm-signal to the\r\ninhabitants of Roras, determined to act openly, and therefore\r\nproclaimed, that ample rewards should be given to any one who would bear\r\narms against the obstinate heretics of Roras, as he called them; and\r\nthat any officer who would exterminate them should be rewarded in a\r\nprincely manner.\r\n\r\nThis engaged captain Mario, a bigoted Roman catholic, and a desperate\r\nruffian, to undertake the enterprise. He, therefore, obtained leave to\r\nraise a regiment in the following six towns: Lucerne, Borges, Famolas,\r\nBobbio, Begnal, and Cavos.\r\n\r\nHaving completed his regiment, which consisted of 1000 men, he laid his\r\nplan not to go by the defiles or the passes, but to attempt gaining the\r\nsummit of a rock, from whence he imagined he could pour his troops into\r\nthe town without much difficulty or opposition.\r\n\r\nThe protestants suffered the Roman catholic troops to gain almost the\r\nsummit of the rock, without giving them any opposition, or ever\r\nappearing in their sight: but when they had almost reached the top they\r\nmade a most furious attack upon them; one party keeping up a\r\nwell-directed and constant fire, and another party rolling down huge\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThis stopped the career of the papist troops: many were killed by the\r\nmusketry, and more by the stones, which beat them down the precipices.\r\nSeveral fell sacrifices to their hurry, for by attempting a precipitate\r\nretreat, they fell down, and were dashed to pieces; and captain Mario\r\nhimself narrowly escaped with his life, for he fell from a craggy place\r\ninto a river which washed the foot of the rock. He was taken up\r\nsenseless, but afterwards recovered, though he was ill of the bruises\r\nfor a long time; and, at length, he fell into a decline at Lucerne,\r\nwhere he died.\r\n\r\nAnother body of troops was ordered from the camp at Villaro, to make an\r\nattempt upon Roras; but these were likewise defeated, by means of the\r\nprotestants' ambush-fighting, and compelled to retreat again to the camp\r\nat Villaro.\r\n\r\nAfter each of these signal victories, captain Gianavel made a suitable\r\ndiscourse to his men, causing them to kneel down, and return thanks to\r\nthe Almighty for his providential protection; and usually concluded with\r\nthe eleventh psalm, where the subject is placing confidence in God.\r\n\r\nThe marquis of Pianessa was greatly enraged at being so much baffled by\r\nthe few inhabitants of Roras: he, therefore, determined to attempt their\r\nexpulsion in such a manner as could hardly fail of success.\r\n\r\nWith this view he ordered all the Roman catholic militia of Piedmont to\r\nbe raised and disciplined. When these orders were completed, he joined\r\nto the militia eight thousand regular troops, and dividing the whole\r\ninto three distinct bodies, he designed that three formidable attacks\r\nshould be made at the same time, unless the people of Roras, to whom he\r\nsent an account of his great preparations, would comply with the\r\nfollowing conditions:\r\n\r\n1. To ask pardon for taking up arms. 2. To pay the expenses of all the\r\nexpeditions sent against them. 3. To acknowledge the infallibility of\r\nthe pope. 4. To go to mass. 5. To pray to the saints. 6. To wear beards.\r\n7. To deliver up their ministers. 8. To deliver up their schoolmasters.\r\n9. To go to confession. 10. To pay loans for the delivery of souls from\r\npurgatory. 11. To give up captain Gianavel at discretion. 12. To give up\r\nthe elders of their church at discretion.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Roras, on being acquainted with these conditions,\r\nwere filled with an honest indignation, and, in answer, sent word to the\r\nmarquis, that sooner than comply with them they would suffer three\r\nthings, which, of all others, were the most obnoxious to mankind, viz.\r\n\r\n1. Their estates to be seized. 2. Their houses to be burnt. 3.\r\nThemselves to be murdered.\r\n\r\nExasperated at this message, the marquis sent them this laconic epistle.\r\n\r\n        _To the obstinate Heretics inhabiting Roras._\r\n\r\n    You shall have your request, for the troops sent\r\n    against you have strict injunctions to plunder,\r\n    burn, and kill.\r\n\r\n                                          PIANESSA.\r\n\r\nThe three armies were then put in motion, and the attacks ordered to be\r\nmade thus: the first by the rocks of Villaro; the second by the pass of\r\nBagnol; and the third by the defile of Lucerne.\r\n\r\nThe troops forced their way by the superiority of numbers, and having\r\ngained the rocks, pass, and defile, began to make the most horrid\r\ndepredations, and exercise the greatest cruelties. Men they hanged,\r\nburnt, racked to death, or cut to pieces; women they ripped open,\r\ncrucified, drowned, or threw from the precipices; and children they\r\ntossed upon spears, minced, cut their throats, or dashed out their\r\nbrains. One hundred and twenty-six suffered in this manner, on the first\r\nday of their gaining the town.\r\n\r\nAgreeable to the marquis of Pianessa's orders, they likewise plundered\r\nthe estates, and burnt the houses of the people. Several protestants,\r\nhowever, made their escape, under the conduct of Captain Gianavel, whose\r\nwife and children were unfortunately made prisoners, and sent under a\r\nstrong guard to Turin.\r\n\r\nThe marquis of Pianessa wrote a letter to captain Gianavel, and released\r\na protestant prisoner that he might carry it him. The contents were,\r\nthat if the captain would embrace the Roman catholic religion, he should\r\nbe indemnified for all his losses since the commencement of the war; his\r\nwife and children should be immediately released, and himself honourably\r\npromoted in the duke of Savoy's army; but if he refused to accede to the\r\nproposals made him, his wife and children should be to put to death; and\r\nso large a reward should be given to take him, dead or alive, that even\r\nsome of his own confidential friends should be tempted to betray him,\r\nfrom the greatness of the sum.\r\n\r\nTo this epistle, the brave Gianavel sent the following answer.\r\n\r\n        My Lord Marquis,\r\n\r\n    There is no torment so great or death so cruel, but\r\n    what I would prefer to the abjuration of my\r\n    religion: so that promises lose their effects, and\r\n    menaces only strengthen me in my faith.\r\n\r\n    With respect to my wife and children, my lord,\r\n    nothing can be more afflicting to me than the\r\n    thoughts of their confinement, or more dreadful to\r\n    my imagination, than their suffering a violent and\r\n    cruel death. I keenly feel all the tender\r\n    sensations of husband and parent; my heart is\r\n    replete with every sentiment of humanity; I would\r\n    suffer any torment to rescue them from danger; I\r\n    would die to preserve them.\r\n\r\n    But having said thus much, my lord, I assure you\r\n    that the purchase of their lives must not be the\r\n    price of my salvation. You have them in your power\r\n    it is true; but my consolation is, that your power\r\n    is only a temporary authority over their bodies:\r\n    you may destroy the mortal part, but their immortal\r\n    souls are out of your reach, and will live\r\n    hereafter to bear testimony against you for your\r\n    cruelties. I therefore recommend them and myself to\r\n    God, and pray for a reformation in your heart.\r\n\r\n                                     JOSHUA GIANAVEL.\r\n\r\nThis brave protestant officer, after writing the above letter, retired\r\nto the Alps, with his followers; and being joined by a great number of\r\nother fugitive protestants, he harassed the enemy by continual\r\nskirmishes.\r\n\r\nMeeting one day with a body of papist troops near Bibiana, he, though\r\ninferior in numbers, attacked them with great fury, and put them to the\r\nrout without the loss of a man, though himself was shot through the leg\r\nin the engagement, by a soldier who had hid himself behind a tree; but\r\nGianavel perceiving from whence the shot came, pointed his gun to the\r\nplace, and despatched the person who had wounded him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gianavel hearing that a captain Jahier had collected together a\r\nconsiderable body of protestants, wrote him a letter, proposing a\r\njunction of their forces. Captain Jahier immediately agreed to the\r\nproposal, and marched directly to meet Gianavel.\r\n\r\nThe junction being formed, it was proposed to attack a town, (inhabited\r\nby Roman catholics) called Garcigliana. The assault was given with great\r\nspirit, but a reinforcement of horse and foot having lately entered the\r\ntown, which the protestants knew nothing of, they were repulsed; yet\r\nmade a masterly retreat, and only lost one man in the action.\r\n\r\nThe next attempt of the protestant forces was upon St. Secondo, which\r\nthey attacked with great vigour, but met with a strong resistance from\r\nthe Roman catholic troops, who had fortified the streets, and planted\r\nthemselves in the houses, from whence they poured musket balls in\r\nprodigious numbers. The protestants, however, advanced, under cover of a\r\ngreat number of planks, which some held over their heads, to secure them\r\nfrom the shots of the enemy from the houses, while others kept up a well\r\ndirected fire; so that the houses and entrenchments were soon forced,\r\nand the town taken.\r\n\r\nIn the town they found a prodigious quantity of plunder, which had been\r\ntaken from protestants at various times, and different places, and which\r\nwere stored up in the warehouses, churches, dwelling houses, &c. This\r\nthey removed to a place of safety, to be distributed, with as much\r\njustice as possible, among the sufferers.\r\n\r\nThis successful attack was made with such skill and spirit, that it cost\r\nvery little to the conquering party, the protestants having only 17\r\nkilled, and 26 wounded; while the papists suffered a loss of no less\r\nthan 450 killed and 511 wounded.\r\n\r\nFive protestant officers, viz. Gianavel, Jahier, Laurentio, Genolet, and\r\nBenet, laid a plan to surprise Biqueras. To this end they marched in\r\nfive respective bodies, and by agreement were to make the attack at the\r\nsame time. The captains Jahier and Laurentio passed through two defiles\r\nin the woods, and came to the place in safety, under covert; but the\r\nother three bodies made their approaches through an open country, and,\r\nconsequently, were more exposed to an attack.\r\n\r\nThe Roman catholics taking the alarm, a great number of troops were sent\r\nto relieve Biqueras from Cavors, Bibiana, Fenile, Campiglione, and some\r\nother neighbouring places. When these were united, they determined to\r\nattack the three protestant parties, that were marching through the open\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe protestant officers perceiving the intent of the enemy, and not\r\nbeing at a great distance from each other, joined their forces with the\r\nutmost expedition, and formed themselves in order of battle.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the captains Jahier and Laurentio had assaulted the\r\ntown of Biqueras, and burnt all the out houses, to make their approaches\r\nwith the greater ease; but not being supported as they expected by the\r\nother three protestant captains, they sent a messenger, on a swift\r\nhorse, towards the open country, to inquire the reason.\r\n\r\nThe messenger soon returned and informed them that it was not in the\r\npower of the three protestant captains to support their proceedings, as\r\nthey were themselves attacked by a very superior force in the plain, and\r\ncould scarce sustain the unequal conflict.\r\n\r\nThe captains Jahier and Laurentio, on receiving this intelligence,\r\ndetermined to discontinue the assault on Biqueras, and to proceed, with\r\nall possible expedition, to the relief of their friends on the plain.\r\nThis design proved to be of the most essential service, for just as they\r\narrived at the spot where the two armies were engaged, the papist troops\r\nbegan to prevail, and were on the point of flanking the left wing,\r\ncommanded by captain Gianavel. The arrival of these troops turned the\r\nscale in favour of the protestants; and the papist forces, though they\r\nfought with the most obstinate intrepidity, were totally defeated. A\r\ngreat number were killed and wounded on both sides, and the baggage,\r\nmilitary stores, &c. taken by the protestants were very considerable.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gianavel, having information that three hundred of the enemy\r\nwere to convoy a great quantity of stores, provisions, &c. from La Torre\r\nto the castle of Mirabac, determined to attack them on the way. He,\r\naccordingly, began the assault at Malbec, though with a very inadequate\r\nforce. The contest was long and bloody, but the protestants, at length,\r\nwere obliged to yield to the superiority of numbers, and compelled to\r\nmake a retreat, which they did with great regularity, and but little\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gianavel advanced to an advantageous post, situated near the\r\ntown of Villaro, and then sent the following information and commands to\r\nthe inhabitants.\r\n\r\n1. That he should attack the town in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n2. That with respect to the Roman catholics who had borne arms, whether\r\nthey belonged to the army or not, he should act by the law of\r\nretaliation, and put them to death, for the numerous depredations, and\r\nmany cruel murders, they had committed.\r\n\r\n3. That all women and children, whatever their religion might be, should\r\nbe safe.\r\n\r\n4. That he commanded all male protestants to leave the town and join\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n5. That all apostates, who had, through weakness, abjured their\r\nreligion, should be deemed enemies, unless they renounced their\r\nabjuration.\r\n\r\n6. That all who returned to their duty to God, and themselves, should be\r\nreceived as friends.\r\n\r\nThe protestants, in general, immediately left the town, and joined\r\ncaptain Gianavel with great satisfaction, and the few, who through\r\nweakness or fear, had abjured their faith, recanted their abjuration,\r\nand were received into the bosom of the church. As the marquis of\r\nPianessa had removed the army, and encamped in quite a different part of\r\nthe country, the Roman catholics of Villaro thought it would be folly to\r\nattempt to defend the place with the small force they had. They,\r\ntherefore, fled with the utmost precipitation, leaving the town and most\r\nof their property, to the discretion of the protestants.\r\n\r\nThe protestant commanders having called a council of war, resolved to\r\nmake an attempt upon the town of La Torre.\r\n\r\nThe papists being apprized of the design, detached some troops to defend\r\na defile, through which the protestants must make their approach; but\r\nthese were defeated, compelled to abandon the pass, and forced to\r\nretreat to La Torre.\r\n\r\nThe protestants proceeded on their march, and the troops of La Torre, on\r\ntheir approach, made a furious sally, were repulsed with great loss, and\r\ncompelled to seek shelter in the town. The governor now only thought of\r\ndefending the place, which the protestants began to attack in form; but\r\nafter many brave attempts, and furious assaults, the commanders\r\ndetermined to abandon the enterprise for several reasons, particularly,\r\nbecause they found the place itself too strong, their own number too\r\nweak, and their cannon not adequate to the task of battering down the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nThis resolution taken, the protestant commanders began a masterly\r\nretreat, and conducted it with such regularity, that the enemy did not\r\nchoose to pursue them, or molest their rear, which they might have done,\r\nas they passed the defiles.\r\n\r\nThe next day they mustered, reviewed the army, and found the whole to\r\namount to four hundred and ninety-five men. They then held a council of\r\nwar, and planned an easier enterprise: this was to make an attack on the\r\ncommonalty of Crusol, a place, inhabited by a number of the most bigoted\r\nRoman catholics, and who had exercised, during the persecutions, the\r\nmost unheard-of cruelties on the protestants.\r\n\r\nThe people of Crusol, hearing of the design against them, fled to a\r\nneighbouring fortress, situated on a rock, where the protestants could\r\nnot come to them, for a very few men could render it inaccessible to a\r\nnumerous army. Thus they secured their persons, but were in too much\r\nhurry to secure their property, the principal part of which, indeed, had\r\nbeen plundered from the protestants, and now luckily fell again to the\r\npossession of the right owners. It consisted of many rich and valuable\r\narticles, and what, at that time, was of much more consequence, viz. a\r\ngreat quantity of military stores.\r\n\r\nThe day after the protestants were gone with their booty, eight hundred\r\ntroops arrived to the assistance of the people of Crusol, having been\r\ndespatched from Lucerne, Biqueras, Cavors, &c. But finding themselves\r\ntoo late, and that pursuit would be vain, not to return empty handed,\r\nthey began to plunder the neighbouring villages, though what they took\r\nwas from their friends. After collecting a tolerable booty, they began\r\nto divide it, but disagreeing about the different shares, they fell from\r\nwords to blows, did a great deal of mischief, and then plundered each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOn the very same day in which the protestants were so successful at\r\nCrusol, some papists marched with a design to plunder and burn the\r\nlittle protestant village of Rocappiatta, but by the way they met with\r\nthe protestant forces belonging to the captains Jahier and Laurentio,\r\nwho were posted on the hill of Angrognia. A trivial engagement ensued,\r\nfor the Roman catholics, on the very first attack, retreated in great\r\nconfusion, and were pursued with much slaughter. After the pursuit was\r\nover, some straggling papist troops meeting with a poor peasant, who was\r\na protestant, tied a cord round his head, and strained it till his skull\r\nwas quite crushed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gianavel and captain Jahier concerted a design together to make\r\nan attack upon Lucerne; but captain Jahier not bringing up his forces at\r\nthe time appointed, captain Gianavel determined to attempt the\r\nenterprise himself.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, by a forced march, proceeded towards that place during\r\nthe whole night, and was close to it by break of day. His first care was\r\nto cut the pipes that conveyed water into the town, and then to break\r\ndown the bridge, by which alone provisions from the country could enter.\r\n\r\nHe then assaulted the places and speedily possessed himself of two of\r\nthe out posts; but finding he could not make himself master of the\r\nplace, he prudently retreated with very little loss, blaming, however\r\ncaptain Jahier, for the failure of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe papists being informed that captain Gianavel was at Angrognia with\r\nonly his own company, determined if possible to surprise him. With this\r\nview, a great number of troops were detached from La Torre and other\r\nplaces: one party of these got on top of a mountain, beneath which he\r\nwas posted; and the other party intended to possess themselves of the\r\ngate of St. Bartholomew.\r\n\r\nThe papists thought themselves sure of taking captain Gianavel and every\r\none of his men, as they consisted but of three hundred, and their own\r\nforce was two thousand five hundred. Their design, however, was\r\nprovidentially frustrated, for one of the popish soldiers imprudently\r\nblowing a trumpet before the signal for attack was given, captain\r\nGianavel took the alarm, and posted his little company so advantageously\r\nat the gate of St. Bartholomew, and at the defile by which the enemy\r\nmust descend from the mountains, that the Roman catholic troops failed\r\nin both attacks, and were repulsed with very considerable loss.\r\n\r\nSoon after, captain Jahier came to Angrognia, and joined his forces to\r\nthose of captain Gianavel, giving sufficient reasons to excuse his\r\nbefore-mentioned failure. Captain Jahier now made several secret\r\nexcursions with great success, always selecting the most active troops,\r\nbelonging both to Gianavel and himself. One day he had put himself at\r\nthe head of forty-four men, to proceed upon an expedition, when entering\r\na plain near Ossac, he was suddenly surrounded by a large body of horse.\r\nCaptain Jahier and his men fought desperately, though oppressed by odds,\r\nand killed the commander-in-chief, three captains, and fifty-seven\r\nprivate men, of the enemy. But captain Jahier himself being killed, with\r\nthirty-five of his men, the rest surrendered. One of the soldiers cut\r\noff captain Jahier's head, and carrying it to Turin, presented it to the\r\nduke of Savoy, who rewarded him with six hundred ducatoons.\r\n\r\nThe death of this gentleman was a signal loss to the protestants, as he\r\nwas a real friend to, and companion of, the reformed church. He\r\npossessed a most undaunted spirit, so that no difficulties could deter\r\nhim from undertaking an enterprise, or dangers terrify him in its\r\nexecution. He was pious without affectation, and humane without\r\nweakness; bold in a field, meek in a domestic life, of a penetrating\r\ngenius, active in spirit, and resolute in all his undertakings.\r\n\r\nTo add to the affliction of the protestants, captain Gianavel was, soon\r\nafter, wounded in such a manner that he was obliged to keep his bed.\r\nThey, however, took new courage from misfortunes, and determining not to\r\nlet their spirits droop, attacked a body of popish troops with great\r\nintrepidity; the protestants were much inferior in numbers, but fought\r\nwith more resolution than the papists, and at length routed them with\r\nconsiderable slaughter. During the action, a sergeant named Michael\r\nBertino was killed; when his son, who was close behind him, leaped into\r\nhis place, and said, I have lost my father; but courage, fellow\r\nsoldiers, God is a father to us all.\r\n\r\nSeveral skirmishes likewise happened between the troops of La Torre and\r\nTagliaretto, and the protestant forces, which in general terminated in\r\nfavour of the latter.\r\n\r\nA Protestant gentleman, named Andrion, raised a regiment of horse, and\r\ntook the command of it himself. The sieur John Leger persuaded a great\r\nnumber of protestants to form themselves into volunteer companies; and\r\nan excellent officer, named Michelin, instituted several bands of light\r\ntroops. These being all joined to the remains of the veteran protestant\r\ntroops, (for great numbers had been lost in the various battles,\r\nskirmishes, sieges, &c.) composed a respectable army, which the officers\r\nthought proper to encamp near St. Giovanni.\r\n\r\nThe Roman catholic commanders, alarmed at the formidable appearance, and\r\nincreased strength of the protestant forces, determined, if possible, to\r\ndislodge them from their encampment. With this view, they collected\r\ntogether a large force, consisting of the principal part of the\r\ngarrisons of the Roman catholic towns, the draft from the Irish\r\nbrigades, a great number of regulars sent by the marquis of Pianessa,\r\nthe auxiliary troops, and the independent companies.\r\n\r\nThese, having formed a junction, encamped near the protestants, and\r\nspent several days in calling councils of war, and disputing on the most\r\nproper mode of proceeding. Some were for plundering the country, in\r\norder to draw the protestants from their camp; others were for patiently\r\nwaiting till they were attacked; and a third party were for assaulting\r\nthe protestant camp, and trying to make themselves masters of every\r\nthing in it.\r\n\r\nThe last of them prevailed, and the morning after the resolution had\r\nbeen taken was appointed to put it into execution. The Roman catholic\r\ntroops were accordingly separated into four divisions, three of which\r\nwere to make an attack in different places; and the fourth to remain as\r\na body of reserve to act as occasion might require.\r\n\r\nOne of the Roman catholic officers, previous to the attack, thus\r\nharangued his men:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-soldiers, you are now going to enter upon a great action, which\r\nwill bring you fame and riches. The motives of your acting with spirit\r\nare likewise of the most important nature; namely, the honour of showing\r\nyour loyalty to your sovereign, the pleasure of spilling heretic blood,\r\nand the prospect of plundering the protestant camp. So, my brave\r\nfellows, fall on, give no quarter, kill all you meet, and take all you\r\ncome near.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this inhuman speech the engagement began, and the protestant camp\r\nwas attacked in three places with inconceivable fury. The fight was\r\nmaintained with great obstinacy and perseverance on both sides,\r\ncontinuing without intermission for the space of four hours; for the\r\nseveral companies on both sides relieved each other alternately, and by\r\nthat means kept up a continual fire during the whole action.\r\n\r\nDuring the engagement of the main armies, a detachment was sent from the\r\nbody of reserve to attack the post of Castelas, which, if the papists\r\nhad carried, it would have given them the command of the valleys of\r\nPerosa, St. Martino, and Lucerne; but they were repulsed with great\r\nloss, and compelled to return to the body of reserve, from whence they\r\nhad been detached.\r\n\r\nSoon after the return of this detachment, the Roman catholic troops,\r\nbeing hard pressed in the main battle, sent for the body of reserve to\r\ncome to their support. These immediately marched to their assistance,\r\nand for some time longer held the event doubtful, but at length the\r\nvalour of the protestants prevailed, and the papists were totally\r\ndefeated, with the loss of upwards of three hundred men killed, and many\r\nmore wounded.\r\n\r\nWhen the cyndic of Lucerne, who was indeed a papist, but not a bigoted\r\none, saw the great number of wounded men brought into that city, he\r\nexclaimed, ah! I thought the wolves used to devour the heretics, but now\r\nI see the heretics eat the wolves. This expression being reported to M.\r\nMarolles, the Roman catholic commander in chief at Lucerne, he sent a\r\nvery severe and threatening letter to the cyndic, who was so terrified,\r\nthat the fright threw him into a fever, and he died in a few days.\r\n\r\nThis great battle was fought just before the harvest was got in, when\r\nthe papists, exasperated at their disgrace, and resolved on any kind of\r\nrevenge, spread themselves by night in detached parties over the finest\r\ncorn-fields of the protestants, and set them on fire in sundry places.\r\nSome of these straggling parties, however, suffered for their conduct;\r\nfor the protestants, being alarmed in the night by the blazing of the\r\nfire among the corn, pursued the fugitives early in the morning, and\r\novertaking many, put them to death. The protestant captain Bellin,\r\nlikewise, by way of retaliation, went with a body of light troops, and\r\nburnt the suburbs of La Torre, making his retreat afterward with very\r\nlittle loss.\r\n\r\nA few days after, captain Bellin, with a much stronger body of troops,\r\nattacked the town of La Torre itself, and making a breach in the wall of\r\nthe convent, his men entered, driving the garrison into the citadel, and\r\nburning both town and convent. After having effected this, they made a\r\nregular retreat, as they could not reduce the citadel for want of\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Persecutions of Michael de Molinos, a Native of\r\nSpain._\r\n\r\nMichael de Molinos, a Spaniard of a rich and honourable family, entered,\r\nwhen young, into priest's orders, but would not accept of any preferment\r\nin the church. He possessed great natural abilities, which he dedicated\r\nto the service of his fellow-creatures, without any view of emolument to\r\nhimself. His course of life was pious and uniform; nor did he exercise\r\nthose austerities which are common among the religious orders of the\r\nchurch of Rome.\r\n\r\nBeing of a contemplative turn of mind, he pursued the track of the\r\nmystical divines, and having acquired great reputation in Spain, and\r\nbeing desirous of propagating his sublime mode of devotion, he left his\r\nown country, and settled at Rome. Here he soon connected himself with\r\nsome of the most distinguished among the literati, who so approved of\r\nhis religious maxims, that they concurred in assisting him to propagate\r\nthem; and, in a short time, he obtained a great number of followers,\r\nwho, from the sublime mode of their religion, were distinguished by the\r\nname of Quietists.\r\n\r\nIn 1675, Molinos published a book entitled \"Il Guida Spirituale,\" to\r\nwhich were subjoined recommendatory letters from several great\r\npersonages. One of these was by the archbishop of Reggio; a second by\r\nthe general of the Franciscans; and a third by father Martin de Esparsa,\r\na Jesuit, who had been divinity-professor both at Salamanca and Rome.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the book published, than it was greatly read, and highly\r\nesteemed, both in Italy and Spain; and this so raised the reputation of\r\nthe author, that his acquaintance was coveted by the most respectable\r\ncharacters. Letters were written to him from numbers of people, so that\r\na correspondence was settled between him, and those who approved of his\r\nmethod, in different parts of Europe. Some secular priests, both at Rome\r\nand Naples, declared themselves openly for it, and consulted him, as a\r\nsort of oracle, on many occasions. But those who attached themselves to\r\nhim with the greatest sincerity, were some of the fathers of the\r\nOratory; in particular three of the most eminent, namely, Caloredi,\r\nCiceri, and Petrucci. Many of the cardinals also courted his\r\nacquaintance, and thought themselves happy in being reckoned among the\r\nnumber of his friends. The most distinguished of them was the cardinal\r\nd'Estrees, a man of very great learning, who so highly approved of\r\nMolinos' maxims, that he entered into a close connexion with him. They\r\nconversed together daily, and notwithstanding the distrust a Spaniard\r\nhas naturally of a Frenchman, yet Molinos, who was sincere in his\r\nprinciples, opened his mind without reserve to the cardinal; and by this\r\nmeans a correspondence was settled between Molinos and some\r\ndistinguished characters in France.\r\n\r\nWhilst Molinos was thus labouring to propagate his religious mode,\r\nfather Petrucci wrote several treatises relative to a contemplative\r\nlife; but he mixed in them so many rules for the devotions of the Romish\r\nchurch, as mitigated that censure he might have otherwise incurred. They\r\nwere written chiefly for the use of the nuns, and therefore the sense\r\nwas expressed in the most easy and familiar style.\r\n\r\nMolinos had now acquired such reputation, that the Jesuits and\r\nDominicans began to be greatly alarmed, and determined to put a stop to\r\nthe progress of this method. To do this, it was necessary to decry the\r\nauthor of it; and as heresy is an imputation that makes the strongest\r\nimpression at Rome, Molinos and his followers were given out to be\r\nheretics. Books were also written by some of the Jesuits against Molinos\r\nand his method; but they were all answered with spirit by Molinos.\r\n\r\nThese disputes occasioned such disturbance in Rome, that the whole\r\naffair was taken notice of by the inquisition. Molinos and his book, and\r\nfather Petrucci, with his treatises and letters, were brought under a\r\nsevere examination; and the Jesuits were considered as the accusers. One\r\nof the society had, indeed, approved of Molinos' book but the rest took\r\ncare he should not be again seen at Rome. In the course of the\r\nexamination both Molinos and Petrucci acquitted themselves so well, that\r\ntheir books were again approved, and the answers which the Jesuits had\r\nwritten were censured as scandalous.\r\n\r\nPetrucci's conduct on this occasion was so highly approved, that it not\r\nonly raised the credit of the cause, but his own emolument; for he was\r\nsoon after made bishop of Jesis, which was a new declaration made by the\r\npope in their favour. Their books were now esteemed more than ever,\r\ntheir method was more followed, and the novelty of it, with the new\r\napprobation given after so vigorous an accusation by the Jesuits, all\r\ncontributed to raise the credit, and increase the number of the party.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of father Petrucci in his new dignity greatly contributed\r\nto increase his reputation, so that his enemies were unwilling to give\r\nhim any further disturbance; and, indeed, there was less occasion given\r\nfor censure by his writings than those of Molinos. Some passages in the\r\nlatter were not so cautiously expressed, but there was room to make\r\nexceptions to them; while, on the other hand, Petrucci so fully\r\nexplained himself, as easily to remove the objections made to some parts\r\nof his letter.\r\n\r\nThe great reputation acquired by Molinos and Petrucci, occasioned a\r\ndaily increase of the Quietists. All who were thought sincerely devout,\r\nor at least affected the reputation of it, were reckoned among the\r\nnumber. If these persons were observed to become more strict in their\r\nlives and mental devotions, yet there appeared less zeal in their whole\r\ndeportment as to the exterior parts of the church ceremonies. They were\r\nnot so assiduous at mass, nor so earnest to procure masses to be said\r\nfor their friends; nor were they so frequently either at confession, or\r\nin processions.\r\n\r\nThough the new approbation given to Molinos' book by the inquisition had\r\nchecked the proceedings of his enemies; yet they were still inveterate\r\nagainst him in their hearts, and determined if possible to ruin him.\r\nThey insinuated that he had ill designs, and was, in his heart, an enemy\r\nto the Christian religion: that under pretence of raising men to a\r\nsublime strain of devotion, he intended to erase from their minds a\r\nsense of the mysteries of christianity. And because he was a Spaniard,\r\nthey gave out that he was descended from a Jewish or Mahometan race, and\r\nthat he might carry in his blood, or in his first education, some seeds\r\nof those religions which he had since cultivated with no less art than\r\nzeal. This last calumny gained but little credit at Rome, though it was\r\nsaid an order was sent to examine the registers of the place where\r\nMolinos was baptised.\r\n\r\nMolinos finding himself attacked with great vigour, and the most\r\nunrelenting malice, took every necessary precaution to prevent these\r\nimputations being credited. He wrote a treatise, entitled Frequent and\r\nDaily Communion, which was likewise approved by some of the most learned\r\nof the Romish clergy. This was printed with his Spiritual Guide, in the\r\nyear 1675; and in the preface to it he declared, that he had not written\r\nit with any design to engage himself in matters of controversy, but that\r\nit was drawn from him by the earnest solicitations of many pious people.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, failing, in their attempts of crushing Molinos' power in\r\nRome, applied to the court of France, when, in a short time, they so far\r\nsucceeded, that an order was sent to cardinal d'Estrees, commanding him\r\nto prosecute Molinos with all possible rigour. The cardinal, though so\r\nstrongly attached to Molinos, resolved to sacrifice all that is sacred\r\nin friendship to the will of his master. Finding, however, there was not\r\nsufficient matter for an accusation against him, he determined to supply\r\nthat defect himself. He, therefore, went to the inquisitors, and\r\ninformed them of several particulars, not only relative to Molinos, but\r\nalso Petrucci, both of whom, together with several of their friends,\r\nwere put into the inquisition.\r\n\r\nWhen they were brought before the inquisitors, (which was the beginning\r\nof the year 1684) Petrucci answered the respective questions put to him\r\nwith so much judgment and temper, that he was soon dismissed; and though\r\nMolinos' examination was much longer, it was generally expected he would\r\nhave been likewise discharged: but this was not the case. Though the\r\ninquisitors had not any just accusation against him, yet they strained\r\nevery nerve to find him guilty of heresy. They first objected to his\r\nholding a correspondence in different parts of Europe; but of this he\r\nwas acquitted, as the matter of that correspondence could not be made\r\ncriminal. They then directed their attention to some suspicious papers\r\nfound in his chamber; but Molinos so clearly explained their meaning,\r\nthat nothing could be made of them to his prejudice. At length, cardinal\r\nd'Estrees, after producing the order sent him by the king of France for\r\nprosecuting Molinos, said, he could prove against him more than was\r\nnecessary to convince them he was guilty of heresy. To do this he\r\nperverted the meaning of some passages in Molinos' books and papers, and\r\nrelated many false and aggravating circumstances relative to the\r\nprisoner. He acknowledged he had lived with him under the appearance of\r\nfriendship, but that it was only to discover his principles and\r\nintentions: that he had found them to be of a bad nature, and that\r\ndangerous consequences were likely to ensue; but in order to make a full\r\ndiscovery, he had assented to several things, which, in his heart, he\r\ndetested; and that, by these means, he saw into the secrets of Molinos,\r\nbut determined not to take any notice, till a proper opportunity should\r\noffer of crushing him and his followers.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of d'Estrees' evidence, Molinos was closely confined by\r\nthe inquisition, where he continued for some time, during which period\r\nall was quiet, and his followers prosecuted their mode without\r\ninterruption. But on a sudden the Jesuits determined to extirpate them,\r\nand the storm broke out with the most inveterate vehemence.\r\n\r\nThe count Vespiniani and his lady, Don Paulo Rocchi, confessor to the\r\nprince Borghese, and some of his family, with several others, (in all\r\nseventy persons) were put into the inquisition, among whom many were\r\nhighly esteemed both for their learning and piety. The accusation laid\r\nagainst the clergy was, their neglecting to say the breviary; and the\r\nrest were accused of going to the communion without first attending\r\nconfession. In a word, it was said, they neglected all the exterior\r\nparts of religion, and gave themselves up wholly to solitude and inward\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nThe countess Vespiniani exerted herself in a very particular manner on\r\nher examination before the inquisitors. She said, she had never revealed\r\nher method of devotion to any mortal but her confessor, and that it was\r\nimpossible they should know it without his discovering the secret; that,\r\ntherefore it was time to give over going to confession, if priests made\r\nthis use of it, to discover the most secret thoughts intrusted to them;\r\nand that, for the future, she would only make her confession to God.\r\n\r\nFrom this spirited speech, and the great noise made in consequence of\r\nthe countess's situation, the inquisitors thought it most prudent to\r\ndismiss both her and her husband, lest the people might be incensed, and\r\nwhat she said might lessen the credit of confession. They were,\r\ntherefore, both discharged, but bound to appear whenever they should be\r\ncalled upon.\r\n\r\nBesides those already mentioned, such was the inveteracy of the Jesuits\r\nagainst the Quietists, that within the space of a month upwards of two\r\nhundred persons were put into the inquisition; and that method of\r\ndevotion which had passed in Italy as the most elevated to which mortals\r\ncould aspire, was deemed heretical, and the chief promoters of it\r\nconfined in a wretched dungeon.\r\n\r\nIn order, if possible, to extirpate Quietism, the inquisitors sent a\r\ncircular letter to cardinal Cibo, as the chief minister, to disperse it\r\nthrough Italy. It was addressed to all prelates, informing them, that\r\nwhereas many schools and fraternities were established in several parts\r\nof Italy, in which some persons, under a pretence of leading people into\r\nthe ways of the Spirit, and to the prayer of quietness, instilled into\r\nthem many abominable heresies, therefore a strict charge was given to\r\ndissolve all those societies, and to oblige the spiritual guide to tread\r\nin the known paths; and, in particular, to take care none of that sort\r\nshould be suffered to have the direction of the nunneries. Orders were\r\nlikewise given to proceed, in the way of justice, against those who\r\nshould be found guilty of these abominable errors.\r\n\r\nAfter this a strict inquiry was made into all the nunneries in Rome;\r\nwhen most of their directors and confessors were discovered to be\r\nengaged in this new method. It was found that the Carmelites, the nuns\r\nof the Conception, and those of several other convents, were wholly\r\ngiven up to prayer and contemplation, and that, instead of their beads,\r\nand the other devotions to saints, or images, they were much alone, and\r\noften in the exercise of mental prayer; that when they were asked why\r\nthey had laid aside the use of their beads, and their ancient forms,\r\ntheir answer was, their directors had advised them so to do. Information\r\nof this being given to the inquisition, they sent orders that all books\r\nwritten in the same strain with those of Molinos and Petrucci, should be\r\ntaken from them, and that they should be compelled to return to their\r\noriginal form of devotion.\r\n\r\nThe circular letter sent to cardinal Cibo, produced but little effect,\r\nfor most of the Italian bishops were inclined to Molinos' method. It was\r\nintended that this, as well as all other orders from the inquisitors,\r\nshould be kept secret; but notwithstanding all their care, copies of it\r\nwere printed, and dispersed in most of the principal towns in Italy.\r\nThis gave great uneasiness to the inquisitors, who use every method they\r\ncan to conceal their proceedings from the knowledge of the world. They\r\nblamed the cardinal, and accused him of being the cause of it; but he\r\nretorted on them, and his secretary laid the fault on both.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions, Molinos suffered great indignities from the\r\nofficers of the inquisition; and the only comfort he received was, from\r\nbeing sometimes visited by father Petrucci.\r\n\r\nThough he had lived in the highest reputation in Rome for some years, he\r\nwas now as much despised, as he had been admired, being generally\r\nconsidered as one of the worst of heretics.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Molinos' followers, who had been placed in the\r\ninquisition, having abjured his mode, were dismissed; but a harder fate\r\nawaited Molinos, their leader.\r\n\r\nAfter lying a considerable time in prison, he was at length brought\r\nagain before the inquisitors to answer to a number of articles exhibited\r\nagainst him from his writings. As soon as he appeared in court, a chain\r\nwas put round his body, and a wax-light in his hand, when two friars\r\nread aloud the articles of accusation. Molinos answered each with great\r\nsteadiness and resolution; and notwithstanding his arguments totally\r\ndefeated the force of all, yet he was found guilty of heresy, and\r\ncondemned to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nWhen he left the court he was attended by a priest, who had borne him\r\nthe greatest respect. On his arrival at the prison he entered the cell\r\nallotted for his confinement with great tranquility; and on taking leave\r\nof the priest, thus addressed him: Adieu, father, we shall meet again at\r\nthe day of judgment, and then it will appear on which side the truth is,\r\nwhether on my side, or on yours.\r\n\r\nDuring his confinement, he was several times tortured in the most cruel\r\nmanner, till, at length, the severity of the punishments overpowered his\r\nstrength, and finished his existence.\r\n\r\nThe death of Molinos struck such an impression on his followers, that\r\nthe greater part of them soon abjured his mode; and by the assiduity of\r\nthe Jesuits, Quietism was totally extirpated throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Persecutions in Bohemia under the Papacy._\r\n\r\nThe Roman pontiffs having usurped a power over several churches were\r\nparticularly severe on the Bohemians, which occasioned them to send two\r\nministers and four lay-brothers to Rome, in the year 977, to obtain\r\nredress of the pope. After some delay, their request was granted, and\r\ntheir grievances redressed. Two things in particular they were permitted\r\nto do, viz. to have divine service performed in their own language, and\r\nto give the cup to the laity in the sacrament.\r\n\r\nThe disputes, however, soon broke out again, the succeeding popes\r\nexerting their whole power to impose on the minds of the Bohemians; and\r\nthe latter, with great spirit, aiming to preserve their religious\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nA. D. 1375, some zealous friends of the gospel applied to Charles, king\r\nof Bohemia, to call an economical council, for an inquiry into the\r\nabuses that had crept into the church, and to make a full and thorough\r\nreformation. The king, not knowing how to proceed, sent to the pope for\r\ndirections how to act; but the pontiff was so incensed at this affair,\r\nthat his only reply was, severely punish those rash and profane\r\nheretics. The monarch, accordingly banished every one who had been\r\nconcerned in the application, and, to oblige the pope, laid a great\r\nnumber of additional restraints upon the religious liberties of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe victims of persecution, however, were not so numerous in Bohemia,\r\nuntil after the burning of John Huss and Jerom of Prague. These two\r\neminent reformers were condemned and executed at the instigation of the\r\npope and his emissaries, as the reader will perceive by the following\r\nshort sketch of their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Huss._\r\n\r\nJohn Huss was born at Hussenitz, a village in Bohemia, about the year\r\n1380. His parents gave him the best education their circumstances would\r\nadmit; and having acquired a tolerable knowledge of the classics at a\r\nprivate school, he was removed to the university of Prague, where he\r\nsoon gave strong proofs of his mental powers, and was remarkable for his\r\ndiligence and application to study.\r\n\r\nIn 1398, Huss commenced bachelor of divinity, and was after successively\r\nchosen pastor of the church of Bethlehem, in Prague, and dean and rector\r\nof the university. In these stations he discharged his duties with great\r\nfidelity; and became, at length, so conspicuous for his preaching, which\r\nwas in conformity with the doctrines of Wickliffe, that it was not\r\nlikely he could long escape the notice of the pope and his adherents,\r\nagainst whom he inveighed with no small degree of asperity.\r\n\r\nThe English reformist Wickliffe, had so kindled the light of\r\nreformation, that it began to illumine the darkest corners of popery and\r\nignorance. His doctrines spread into Bohemia, and were well received by\r\ngreat numbers of people, but by none so particularly as John Huss, and\r\nhis zealous friend and fellow-martyr, Jerom of Prague.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop of Prague, finding the reformists daily increasing,\r\nissued a decree to suppress the farther spreading of Wickliffe's\r\nwritings: but this had an effect quite different to what he expected,\r\nfor it stimulated the friends of those doctrines to greater zeal, and\r\nalmost the whole university united to propagate them.\r\n\r\nBeing strongly attached to the doctrines of Wickliffe, Huss opposed the\r\ndecree of the archbishop, who, however, at length, obtained a bull from\r\nthe pope, giving him commission to prevent the publishing of Wickliffe's\r\ndoctrines in his province. By virtue of this bull, the archbishop\r\ncondemned the writings of Wickliffe: he also proceeded against four\r\ndoctors, who had not delivered up the copies of that divine, and\r\nprohibited them, notwithstanding their privileges, to preach to any\r\ncongregation. Dr. Huss, with some other members of the university,\r\nprotested against these proceedings, and entered an appeal from the\r\nsentence of the archbishop.\r\n\r\nThe affair being made known to the pope, he granted a commission to\r\ncardinal Colonna, to cite John Huss to appear personally at the court of\r\nRome, to answer the accusations laid against him, of preaching both\r\nerrors and heresies. Dr. Huss desired to be excused from a personal\r\nappearance, and was so greatly favoured in Bohemia, that king\r\nWinceslaus, the queen, the nobility, and the university, desired the\r\npope to dispense with such an appearance; as also that he would not\r\nsuffer the kingdom of Bohemia to lie under the accusation of heresy, but\r\npermit them to preach the gospel with freedom in their places of\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nThree proctors appeared for Dr. Huss before cardinal Colonna. They\r\nendeavoured to excuse his absence, and said, they were ready to answer\r\nin his behalf. But, the cardinal declared Huss contumacious, and\r\nexcommunicated him accordingly. The proctors appealed to the pope, and\r\nappointed four cardinals to examine the process: these commissioners\r\nconfirmed the former sentence, and extended the excommunication not only\r\nto Huss but to all his friends and followers.\r\n\r\nFrom this unjust sentence Huss appealed to a future council, but without\r\nsuccess; and, notwithstanding so severe a decree, and an expulsion in\r\nconsequence from his church in Prague, he retired to Hussenitz, his\r\nnative place, where he continued to promulgate his new doctrine, both\r\nfrom the pulpit and with the pen.\r\n\r\nThe letters which he wrote at this time were very numerous; and he\r\ncompiled a treatise in which he maintained, that reading the book of\r\nprotestants could not be absolutely forbidden. He wrote in defence of\r\nWickliffe's book on the Trinity; and boldly declared against the vices\r\nof the pope, the cardinals, and clergy, of those corrupt times. He wrote\r\nalso many other books, all of which were penned with a strength of\r\nargument that greatly facilitated the spreading of his doctrines.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, 1414, a general council was assembled at\r\nConstance, in Germany, in order, as was pretended, for the sole purpose\r\nof determining a dispute then pending between three persons who\r\ncontended for the papacy; but the real motive was, to crush the progress\r\nof the reformation.\r\n\r\nJohn Huss was summoned to appear at this council; and, to encourage him,\r\nthe emperor sent him a safe-conduct: the civilities, and even reverence,\r\nwhich Huss met with on his journey, were beyond imagination. The\r\nstreets, and, sometimes the very roads, were lined with people, whom\r\nrespect, rather than curiosity, had brought together.\r\n\r\nHe was ushered into the town with great acclamations and it may be said,\r\nthat he passed through Germany in a kind of triumph. He could not help\r\nexpressing his surprise at the treatment he received: \"I thought (said\r\nhe) I had been an outcast. I now see my worst friends are in Bohemia.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Huss arrived at Constance, he immediately took lodgings in a\r\nremote part of the city. A short time after his arrival, came one\r\nStephen Paletz, who was employed by the clergy at Prague to manage the\r\nintended prosecution against him. Paletz was afterward joined by Michael\r\nde Cassis, on the part of the court of Rome. These two declared\r\nthemselves his accusers, and drew up a set of articles against him,\r\nwhich they presented to the pope and the prelates of the council.\r\n\r\nWhen it was known that he was in the city, he was immediately arrested,\r\nand committed prisoner to a chamber in the palace. This violation of\r\ncommon law and justice, was particularly noticed by one of Huss'\r\nfriends, who urged the imperial safe-conduct; but the pope replied, he\r\nnever granted any safe-conduct, nor was he bound by that of the emperor.\r\n\r\nWhile Huss was in confinement, the council acted the part of\r\ninquisitors. They condemned the doctrines of Wickliffe, and even ordered\r\nhis remains to be dug up and burnt to ashes; which orders were strictly\r\ncomplied with. In the mean time, the nobility of Bohemia and Poland\r\nstrongly interceded for Huss; and so far prevailed as to prevent his\r\nbeing condemned unheard, which had been resolved on by the commissioners\r\nappointed to try him.\r\n\r\nWhen he was brought before the council, the articles exhibited against\r\nhim were read: they were upwards of forty in number, and chiefly\r\nextracted from his writings.\r\n\r\nAfter his examination, he was taken from the court, and a resolution was\r\nformed by the council to burn him as a heretic if he would not retract.\r\nHe was then committed to a filthy prison, where, in the daytime, he was\r\nso laden with fetters on his legs, that he could hardly move, and every\r\nnight he was fastened by his hand to a ring against the walls of the\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nAfter continuing some days in this situation, many noblemen of Bohemia\r\ninterceded in his behalf. They drew up a petition for his release, which\r\nwas presented to the council by several of the most distinguished nobles\r\nof Bohemia; a few days after the petition was presented, four bishops\r\nand two lords were sent by the emperor to the prison, in order to\r\nprevail on Huss to make a recantation. But he called God to witness,\r\nwith tears in his eyes, that he was not conscious of having preached or\r\nwritten, against the truth of God, or the faith of his orthodox church.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, Dr. Huss was brought for the last time before the\r\ncouncil. After a long examination he was desired to abjure, which he\r\nrefused without the least hesitation. The bishop of Lodi then preached a\r\nsanguinary sermon, concerning the destruction of heretics, the prologue\r\nto his intended punishment. After the close of the sermon, his fate was\r\ndetermined, his vindication was disregarded, and judgment pronounced.\r\nHuss heard this sentence without the least emotion. At the close of it\r\nhe knelt down, with his eyes lifted towards heaven, and with all the\r\nmagnanimity of a primitive martyr, thus exclaimed: \"May thy infinite\r\nmercy, O my God! pardon this injustice of mine enemies. Thou knowest the\r\ninjustice of my accusations; how deformed with crimes I have been\r\nrepresented; how I have been oppressed with worthless witnesses, and a\r\nfalse condemnation; yet, O my God! let that mercy of thine, which no\r\ntongue can express, prevail with thee not to avenge my wrongs.\"\r\n\r\nThese excellent sentences were esteemed as so many expressions of\r\ntreason, and tended to inflame his adversaries. Accordingly, the bishops\r\nappointed by the council stripped him of his priestly garments, degraded\r\nhim, put a paper mitre on his head, on which was painted devils, with\r\nthis inscription, \"A ringleader of heretics.\" Our heroic martyr received\r\nthis mock mitre with an air of unconcern, which seemed to give him\r\ndignity rather than disgrace. A serenity, nay, even a joy appeared in\r\nhis looks, which indicated that his soul had cut off many stages of a\r\ntedious journey in her way to the realms of everlasting peace.\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony of degradation was over, the bishops delivered Dr.\r\nHuss to the emperor, who put him into the hands of the duke of Bavaria.\r\nHis books were burnt at the gates of the church; and on the 6th of July,\r\nhe was led to the suburbs of Constance, to be burnt alive. On his\r\narrival at the place of execution, he fell on his knees, sung several\r\nportions of the Psalms, looked steadfastly towards heaven, and repeated\r\nthese words: \"Into thy hands, O Lord! do I commit my spirit: thou hast\r\nredeemed me, O most good and merciful God!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the chain was put about him at the stake, he said, with a smiling\r\ncountenance, \"My Lord Jesus Christ was bound with a harder chain than\r\nthis for my sake, and why then should I be ashamed of this rusty one?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the fagots were piled up to his very neck, the duke of Bavaria was\r\nso officious as to desire him to abjure. \"No, (said Huss;) I never\r\npreached any doctrine of an evil tendency; and what I taught with my\r\nlips I now seal with my blood.\" He then said to the executioner, \"You\r\nare now going to burn a goose, (Huss signifying goose in the Bohemian\r\nlanguage;) but in a century you will have a swan whom you can neither\r\nroast nor boil.\" If he were prophetic, he must have meant Martin Luther,\r\nwho shone about a hundred years after, and who had a swan for his arms.\r\n\r\nThe flames were now applied to the fagots, when our martyr sung a hymn\r\nwith so loud and cheerful a voice, that he was heard through all the\r\ncracklings of the combustibles, and the noise of the multitude. At\r\nlength his voice was interrupted by the severity of the flames, which\r\nsoon closed his existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jerom of Prague._\r\n\r\nThis reformer, who was the companion of Dr. Huss, and may be said to be\r\na co-martyr with him, was born at Prague, and educated in that\r\nuniversity, where he particularly distinguished himself for his great\r\nabilities and learning. He likewise visited several other learned\r\nseminaries in Europe, particularly the universities of Paris,\r\nHeidelburg, Cologn, and Oxford. At the latter place he became acquainted\r\nwith the works of Wickliffe, and being a person of uncommon application,\r\nhe translated many of them into his native language, having with great\r\npains, made himself master of the English tongue.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Prague, he professed himself an open favourer of\r\nWickliffe, and finding that his doctrines had made considerable progress\r\nin Bohemia, and that Huss was the principal promoter of them, he became\r\nan assistant to him in the great work of reformation.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of April, 1415, Jerom arrived at Constance, about three\r\nmonths before the death of Huss. He entered the town privately, and\r\nconsulting with some of the leaders of his party, whom he found there,\r\nwas easily convinced he could not be of any service to his friends.\r\n\r\nFinding that his arrival in Constance was publicly known, and that the\r\ncouncil intended to seize him, he thought it most prudent to retire.\r\nAccordingly, the next day he went to Iberling, an imperial town, about a\r\nmile from Constance. From this place he wrote to the emperor, and\r\nproposed his readiness to appear before the council, if he would give\r\nhim a safe-conduct; but this was refused. He then applied to the\r\ncouncil, but met with an answer no less unfavourable than that from the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\nAfter this, he set out on his return to Bohemia. He had the precaution\r\nto take with him a certificate, signed by several of the Bohemian\r\nnobility, then at Constance, testifying that he had used all prudent\r\nmeans in his power to procure a hearing.\r\n\r\nJerom, however, did not thus escape. He was seized at Hirsaw, by an\r\nofficer belonging to the duke of Sultsbach, who, though unauthorized so\r\nto act, made little doubt of obtaining thanks from the council for so\r\nacceptable a service.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Sultsbach, having Jerom now in his power, wrote to the\r\ncouncil for directions how to proceed. The council, after expressing\r\ntheir obligations to the duke, desired him to send the prisoner\r\nimmediately to Constance. The elector palatine met him on the way, and\r\nconducted him into the city, himself riding on horseback, with a\r\nnumerous retinue, who led Jerom in fetters by a long chain; and\r\nimmediately on his arrival he was committed to a loathsome dungeon.\r\n\r\nJerom was treated nearly in the same manner as Huss had been, only that\r\nhe was much longer confined, and shifted from one prison to another. At\r\nlength, being brought before the council, he desired that he might plead\r\nhis own cause, and exculpate himself: which being refused him, he broke\r\nout into the following elegant exclamation:\r\n\r\n\"What barbarity is this! For three hundred and forty days have I been\r\nconfined in a variety of prisons. There is not a misery, there is not a\r\nwant, that I have not experienced. To my enemies you have allowed the\r\nfullest scope of accusation: to me, you deny, the least opportunity of\r\ndefence. Not an hour will you now indulge me in preparing for my trial.\r\nYou have swallowed the blackest calumnies against me. You have\r\nrepresented me as a heretic, without knowing my doctrine; as an enemy to\r\nthe faith, before you knew what faith I professed; as a persecutor of\r\npriests before you could have an opportunity of understanding my\r\nsentiments on that head. You are a general council: in you centre all\r\nthis world can communicate of gravity, wisdom, and sanctity: but still\r\nyou are men, and men are seducible by appearances. The higher your\r\ncharacter is for wisdom, the greater ought your care to be not to\r\ndeviate into folly. The cause I now plead is not my own cause: it is the\r\ncause of men, it is the cause of christians; it is a cause which is to\r\naffect the rights of posterity, however the experiment is to be made in\r\nmy person.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech had not the least effect; Jerom was obliged to hear the\r\ncharge read, which was reduced under the following heads:--1. That he\r\nwas a derider of the papal dignity;--2. An opposer of the pope;--3. An\r\nenemy to the cardinals;--4. A persecutor of the prelates;--and 5. A\r\nhater of the christian religion.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Jerom was brought on the third day after his accusation and\r\nwitnesses were examined in support of the charge. The prisoner was\r\nprepared for his defence, which appears almost incredible, when we\r\nconsider he had been three hundred and forty days shut up in loathsome\r\nprisons, deprived of daylight, and almost starved for want of common\r\nnecessaries. But his spirit soared above these disadvantages, under\r\nwhich a man less animated would have sunk; nor was he more at a loss for\r\nquotations from the fathers and ancient authors than if he had been\r\nfurnished with the finest library.\r\n\r\nThe most bigoted of the assembly were unwilling he should be heard,\r\nknowing what effect eloquence is apt to have on the minds of the most\r\nprejudiced. At length, however, it was carried by the majority, that he\r\nshould have liberty to proceed in his defence, which he began to such an\r\nexalted strain of moving elocution, that the heart of obdurate zeal was\r\nseen to melt, and the mind of superstition seemed to admit a ray of\r\nconviction. He made an admirable distinction between evidence as resting\r\nupon facts, and as supported by malice and calumny. He laid before the\r\nassembly the whole tenor of his life and conduct. He observed that the\r\ngreatest and most holy men had been known to differ in points of\r\nspeculation, with a view to distinguish truth, not to keep it concealed.\r\nHe expressed a noble contempt of all his enemies, who would have induced\r\nhim to retract the cause of virtue and truth. He entered upon a high\r\nencomium of Huss; and declared he was ready to follow him in the\r\nglorious track of martyrdom. He then touched upon the most defensible\r\ndoctrines of Wickliffe; and concluded with observing that it was far\r\nfrom his intention to advance any thing against the state of the church\r\nof God; that it was only against the abuse of the clergy he complained;\r\nand that he could not help saying, it was certainly impious that the\r\npatrimony of the church, which was originally intended for the purpose\r\nof charity and universal benevolence, should be prostituted to the pride\r\nof the eye, in feasts, foppish vestments, and other reproaches to the\r\nname and profession of christianity.\r\n\r\nThe trial being over, Jerom received the same sentence that had been\r\npassed upon his martyred countryman. In consequence of this he was, in\r\nthe usual style of popish affectation, delivered over to the civil\r\npower: but as he was a layman, he had not to undergo the ceremony of\r\ndegradation. They had prepared a cap of paper painted with red devils,\r\nwhich being put upon his head, he said, \"Our Lord Jesus Christ, when he\r\nsuffered death for me a most miserable sinner, did wear a crown of\r\nthorns upon his head, and for His sake will I wear this cap.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days were allowed him in hopes that he would recant; in which time\r\nthe cardinal of Florence used his utmost endeavours to bring him over.\r\nBut they all proved ineffectual. Jerom was resolved to seal the doctrine\r\nwith his blood; and he suffered death with the most distinguished\r\nmagnanimity.\r\n\r\nIn going to the place of execution he sung several hymns, and when he\r\ncame to the spot, which was the same where Huss had been burnt, he knelt\r\ndown, and prayed fervently. He embraced the stake with great\r\ncheerfulness, and when they went behind him to set fire to the fagots,\r\nhe said, \"Come here, and kindle it before my eyes; for if I had been\r\nafraid of it, I had not come to this place.\" The fire being kindled, he\r\nsung a hymn, but was soon interrupted by the flames; and the last words\r\nhe was heard to say these:--\"This soul in flames I offer.\"\r\n\r\nThe elegant Pogge, a learned gentleman of Florence, secretary to two\r\npopes, and a zealous but liberal catholic, in a letter to Leonard\r\nArotin, bore ample testimony of the extraordinary powers and virtues of\r\nJerom whom he emphatically styles, A prodigious man!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zisca._\r\n\r\nThe real name of this zealous servant of Christ was John de Trocznow,\r\nthat of Zisca is a Bohemian word, signifying one-eyed, as he had lost an\r\neye. He was a native of Bohemia, of a good family and left the court of\r\nWinceslaus, to enter into the service of the king of Poland against the\r\nTeutonic knights. Having obtained a badge of honour and a purse of\r\nducats for his gallantry, at the close of the war he returned to the\r\ncourt of Winceslaus, to whom he boldly avowed the deep interest he took\r\nin the bloody affront offered to his majesty's subjects at Constance in\r\nthe affair of Huss. Winceslaus lamented it was not in his power to\r\nrevenge it; and from this moment Zisca is said to have formed the idea\r\nof asserting the religious liberties of his country. In the year 1418,\r\nthe council was dissolved, having done more mischief than good, and in\r\nthe summer of that year a general meeting was held of the friends of\r\nreligious reformation, at the castle of Wilgrade, who, conducted by\r\nZisca, repaired to the emperor with arms in their hands, and offered to\r\ndefend him against his enemies. The king bid them use their arms\r\nproperly, and this stroke of policy first insured to Zisca the\r\nconfidence of his party.\r\n\r\nWinceslaus was succeeded by Sigismond, his brother, who rendered himself\r\nodious to the Reformers; and removed all such as were obnoxious to his\r\ngovernment. Zisca and his friends, upon this, immediately flew to arms,\r\ndeclared war against the emperor and the pope, and laid siege to Pilsen\r\nwith 40,000 men. They soon became masters of the fortress, and in a\r\nshort time all the south-west part of Bohemia submitted, which greatly\r\nincreased the army of the reformers. The latter having taken the pass of\r\nMuldaw, after a severe conflict of five days and nights, the emperor\r\nbecame alarmed, and withdrew his troops from the confines of Turkey, to\r\nmarch them into Bohemia. At Berne in Moravia, he halted, and sent\r\ndespatches to treat of peace, as a preliminary to which, Zisca gave up\r\nPilsen and all the fortresses he had taken. Sigismond proceeding in a\r\nmanner that clearly manifested he acted on the Roman doctrine, that no\r\nfaith was to be kept with heretics, and treating some of the authors of\r\nthe late disturbances with severity, the alarm-bell of revolt was\r\nsounded from one end of Bohemia to the other. Zisca took the castle of\r\nPrague by the power of money, and on the 19th of August, 1420, defeated\r\nthe small army the emperor had hastily got together to oppose him. He\r\nnext took Ausea by assault, and destroyed the town with a barbarity that\r\ndisgraced the cause in which he fought.\r\n\r\nWinter approaching, Zisca fortified his camp on a strong hill about\r\nforty miles from Prague, which he called Mount Tabor, from whence he\r\nsurprised a body of horse at midnight, and made a thousand men\r\nprisoners. Shortly after, the emperor obtained possession of the strong\r\nfortress of Prague, by the same means that Zisca had before done: it was\r\nsoon blockaded by the latter, and want began to threaten the emperor,\r\nwho saw the necessity of a retreat.\r\n\r\nDetermined to make a desperate effort, Sigismond attacked the fortified\r\ncamp of Zisca on Mount Tabor, and carried it with great slaughter. Many\r\nother fortresses also fell, and Zisca withdrew to a craggy hill, which\r\nhe strongly fortified, and whence he so annoyed the emperor in his\r\napproaches against the town of Prague, that he found he must either\r\nabandon the siege or defeat his enemy. The marquis of Misnia was deputed\r\nto effect this with a large body of troops, but the event was fatal to\r\nthe imperialists; they were defeated, and the emperor having lost nearly\r\none third of his army, retreated from the siege of Prague, harassed in\r\nhis rear by the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1421, Zisca commenced the campaign, as before, by\r\ndestroying all the monasteries in his way. He laid siege to the castle\r\nof Wisgrade, and the emperor coming to relieve it, fell into a snare,\r\nwas defeated with dreadful slaughter, and this important fortress was\r\ntaken. Our general had now leisure to attend to the work of reformation,\r\nbut he was much disgusted with the gross ignorance and superstition of\r\nthe Bohemian clergy, who rendered themselves contemptible in the eyes of\r\nthe whole army. When he saw any symptoms of uneasiness in his camp, he\r\nwould spread alarm in order to divert them, and draw his men into\r\naction. In one of these expeditions, he encamped before the town of\r\nRubi, and while pointing out the place for an assault, an arrow shot\r\nfrom the wall struck him in the eye. At Prague it was extracted, but,\r\nbeing barbed, it tore the eye out with it. A fever succeeded, and his\r\nlife was with difficulty preserved. He was now totally blind, but still\r\ndesirous of attending the army. The emperor having summoned the states\r\nof the empire to assist him, it was resolved, with their assistance, to\r\nattack Zisca in the winter, when many of his troops departed till the\r\nreturn of spring.\r\n\r\nThe confederate princes undertook the siege of Soisin, but at the\r\napproach merely of the Bohemian general, they retreated. Sigismond\r\nnevertheless advanced with his formidable army, consisting of 15,000\r\nHungarian horse and 25,000 infantry, well equipped for a winter\r\ncampaign. This army spread terror through all the east of Bohemia.\r\nWherever Sigismond marched, the magistrates laid their keys at his feet,\r\nand were treated with severity or favour, according to their merits in\r\nhis cause. Zisca, however, with speedy marches, approached, and the\r\nemperor resolved to try his fortune once more with that invincible\r\nchief. On the 13th of January, 1422, the two armies met on a spacious\r\nplain near Kamnitz. Zisca appeared in the centre of his front line,\r\nguarded, or rather conducted, by a horseman on each side, armed with a\r\npole-axe. His troops having sung a hymn with a determined coolness drew\r\ntheir swords, and waited for a signal. When his officers had informed\r\nhim that the ranks were all well closed, he waved his sabre round his\r\nhead, which was the sign of battle.\r\n\r\nThis battle is described as a most awful sight. The extent of the plain\r\nwas one continued scene of disorder. The imperial army fled towards the\r\nconfines of Moravia, the Taborites, without intermission, galling their\r\nrear. The river Igla, then frozen, opposed their flight. The enemy\r\npressing furiously, many of the infantry, and in a manner the whole body\r\nof the cavalry attempted the river. The ice gave way and not fewer than\r\n2000 were swalled up in the water. Zisca now returned to Tabor, laden\r\nwith all the spoils and trophies which the most complete victory could\r\ngive.\r\n\r\nZisca now began again to pay attention to the reformation; he forbid all\r\nthe prayers for the dead, images, sacerdotal vestments, fasts, and\r\nfestivals. Priests were to be preferred according to their merits, and\r\nno one to be persecuted for religious opinions. In every thing Zisca\r\nconsulted the liberal minded, and did nothing without general\r\nconcurrence. An alarming disagreement now arose at Prague between the\r\nmagistrates who were Calixtans, or receivers of the sacraments in both\r\nkinds, and the Taborites, nine of the chiefs of whom were privately\r\narraigned, and put to death. The populace, enraged, sacrificed the\r\nmagistrates, and the affair terminated without any particular\r\nconsequence. The Calixtans having sunk into contempt, Zisca was\r\nsolicited to assume the crown of Bohemia; but this he nobly refused, and\r\nprepared for the next campaign, in which Sigismond resolved to make his\r\nlast effort. While the marquis of Misnia penetrated into Upper Saxony,\r\nthe emperor proposed to enter Moravia, on the side of Hungary. Before\r\nthe marquis had taken the field, Zisca sat down before the strong town\r\nof Ausig, situate on the Elbe. The marquis flew to its relief with a\r\nsuperior army, and, after an obstinate engagement, was totally defeated\r\nand Ausig capitulated. Zisca then went to the assistance of Procop, a\r\nyoung general whom he had appointed to keep Sigismond in check, and whom\r\nhe compelled to abandon the siege of Pernitz, after laying eight weeks\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\nZisca, willing to give his troops some respite from fatigue, now entered\r\nPrague, hoping his presence would quell any uneasiness that might remain\r\nafter the late disturbance: but he was suddenly attacked by the people;\r\nand he and his troop having beaten off the citizens effected a retreat\r\nto his army, whom he acquainted with the treacherous conduct of the\r\nCalixtans. Every effort of address was necessary to appease their\r\nvengeful animosity, and at night, in a private interview between\r\nRoquesan, an ecclesiastic of great eminence in Prague, and Zisca, the\r\nlatter became reconciled, and the intended hostilities were done away.\r\n\r\nMutually tired of the war, Sigismond sent to Zisca, requesting him to\r\nsheath his sword, and name his conditions. A place of congress being\r\nappointed, Zisca, with his chief officers, set out to meet the emperor.\r\nCompelled to pass through a part of the country where the plague raged,\r\nhe was seized with it at the castle of Briscaw and departed this life,\r\nOctober 6, 1424. Like Moses, he died in view of the completion of his\r\nlabours, and was buried in the great church of Czaslow, in Bohemia,\r\nwhere a monument is erected to his memory, with this inscription on\r\nit--\"Here lies John Zisca, who, having defended his country against the\r\nencroachments of papal tyranny, rests in this hallowed place in despite\r\nof the pope.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Zisca, Procop was defeated, and fell with the\r\nliberties of his country.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Huss and Jerom, the pope, in conjunction with the\r\ncouncil of Constance, ordered the Roman clergy every where, to\r\nexcommunicate such as adopted their opinions, or commisserated their\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThese orders occasioned great contentions between the papists and\r\nreformed Bohemians, which was the cause of a violent persecution against\r\nthe latter. At Prague, the persecution was extremely severe, till, at\r\nlength, the reformed being driven to desperation, armed themselves,\r\nattacked the senate-house, and threw twelve senators, with the speaker,\r\nout of the senate-house windows, whose bodies fell upon spears, which\r\nwere held up by others of the reformed in the street, to receive them.\r\n\r\nBeing informed of these proceedings, the pope came to Florence, and\r\npublicly excommunicated the reformed Bohemians, exciting the emperor of\r\nGermany, and all kings, princes, dukes, &c. to take up arms, in order to\r\nextirpate the whole race; and promising, by way of encouragement, full\r\nremission of all sins whatever, to the most wicked person, if he did but\r\nkill one Bohemian protestant.\r\n\r\nThis occasioned a bloody war; for several popish princes undertook the\r\nextirpation, or at least expulsion, of the proscribed people; and the\r\nBohemians, arming themselves, prepared to repel force by force, in the\r\nmost vigorous and effectual manner. The popish army prevailing against\r\nthe protestant forces at the battle of Cuttenburgh, the prisoners of the\r\nreformed were taken to three deep mines near that town and several\r\nhundreds were cruelly thrown into each, where they miserably perished.\r\n\r\nA merchant of Prague, going to Breslaw, in Silesia, happened to lodge in\r\nthe same inn with several priests. Entering into conversation upon the\r\nsubject of religious controversy, he passed many encomiums upon the\r\nmartyred John Huss, and his doctrines. The priests taking umbrage at\r\nthis, laid an information against him the next morning, and he was\r\ncommitted to prison as a heretic. Many endeavours were used to persuade\r\nhim to embrace the Roman catholic faith, but he remained steadfast to\r\nthe pure doctrines of the reformed church. Soon after his imprisonment,\r\na student of the university was committed to the same jail; when, being\r\npermitted to converse with the merchant, they mutually comforted each\r\nother. On the day appointed for execution, when the jailer began to\r\nfasten ropes to their feet, by which they were to be dragged through the\r\nstreets, the student appeared quite terrified, and offered to abjure his\r\nfaith, and turn Roman catholic if he might be saved. The offer was\r\naccepted, his abjuration was taken by a priest, and he was set at\r\nliberty. A priest applying to the merchant to follow the example of the\r\nstudent, he nobly said, \"Lose no time in hopes of my recantation, your\r\nexpectations will be vain; I sincerely pity that poor wretch, who has\r\nmiserably sacrificed his soul for a few more uncertain years of a\r\ntroublesome life; and, so far from having the least idea of following\r\nhis example, I glory in the very thoughts of dying for the sake of\r\nChrist.\" On hearing these words, the priest ordered the executioner to\r\nproceed, and the merchant being drawn through the city was brought to\r\nthe place of execution, and there burnt.\r\n\r\nPichel, a bigoted popish magistrate, apprehended 24 protestants, among\r\nwhom was his daughter's husband. As they all owned they were of the\r\nreformed religion, he indiscriminately condemned them to be drowned in\r\nthe river Abbis. On the day appointed for the execution, a great\r\nconcourse of people attended, among whom was Pichel's daughter. This\r\nworthy wife threw herself at her father's feet, bedewed them with tears,\r\nand in the most pathetic manner, implored him to commisserate her\r\nsorrow, and pardon her husband. The obdurate magistrate sternly replied,\r\n\"Intercede not for him, child, he is a heretic, a vile heretic.\" To\r\nwhich she nobly answered, \"Whatever his faults may be, or however his\r\nopinions may differ from yours, he is still my husband, a name which, at\r\na time like this, should alone employ my whole consideration.\" Pichel\r\nflew into a violent passion and said, \"You are mad! cannot you, after\r\nthe death of this, have a much worthier husband?\" \"No, sir, (replied\r\nshe) my affections are fixed upon this, and death itself shall not\r\ndissolve my marriage vow.\" Pichel, however, continued inflexible, and\r\nordered the prisoners to be tied with their hands and feet behind them,\r\nand in that manner be thrown into the river. As soon as this was put\r\ninto execution, the young lady watched her opportunity, leaped into the\r\nwaves, and embracing the body of her husband, both sunk together into\r\none watery grave. An uncommon instance of conjugal love in a wife, and\r\nof an inviolable attachment to, and personal affection for, her husband.\r\n\r\nThe emperor Ferdinand, whose hatred to the Bohemian protestants was\r\nwithout bounds, not thinking he had sufficiently oppressed them,\r\ninstituted a high court of reformers, upon the plan of the inquisition,\r\nwith this difference, that the reformers were to remove from place to\r\nplace, and always to be attended by a body of troops.\r\n\r\nThese reformers consisted chiefly of Jesuits, and from their decision,\r\nthere was no appeal, by which it may be easily conjectured, that it was\r\na dreadful tribunal indeed.\r\n\r\nThis bloody court, attended by a body of troops, made the tour of\r\nBohemia, to which they seldom examined or saw a prisoner, suffering the\r\nsoldiers to murder the protestants as they pleased, and then to make a\r\nreport of the matter to them afterward.\r\n\r\nThe first victim of their cruelty was an aged minister whom they killed\r\nas he lay sick in his bed, the next day they robbed, and murdered\r\nanother, and soon after shot a third, as he was preaching in his pulpit.\r\n\r\nA nobleman and clergyman, who resided in a protestant village, hearing\r\nof the approach of the high court of reformers and the troops, fled from\r\nthe place, and secreted themselves. The soldiers, however, on their\r\narrival, seized upon a schoolmaster, asked him where the lord of that\r\nplace and the minister were concealed, and where they had hid their\r\ntreasures. The schoolmaster replied, he could not answer either of the\r\nquestions. They then stripped him naked, bound him with cords, and beat\r\nhim most unmercifully with cudgels. This cruelty not extorting any\r\nconfession from him, they scorched him in various parts of his body;\r\nwhen, to gain a respite from his torments, he promised to show them\r\nwhere the treasures were hid. The soldiers gave ear to this with\r\npleasure, and the schoolmaster led them to a ditch full of stones,\r\nsaying, Beneath these stones are the treasures ye seek for. Eager after\r\nmoney, they went to work, and soon removed those stones, but not finding\r\nwhat they sought after, beat the schoolmaster to death, buried him in\r\nthe ditch, and covered him with the very stones he had made them remove.\r\n\r\nSome of the soldiers ravished the daughters of a worthy protestant\r\nbefore his face, and then tortured him to death. A minister and his wife\r\nthey tied back to back and burnt. Another minister they hung upon a\r\ncross beam, and making a fire under him, broiled him to death. A\r\ngentleman they hacked into small pieces, and they filled a young man's\r\nmouth with gunpowder, and setting fire to it, blew his head to pieces.\r\n\r\nAs their principal rage was directed against the clergy, they took a\r\npious protestant minister, and tormented him daily for a month together,\r\nin the following manner, making their cruelty regular, systematic, and\r\nprogressive.\r\n\r\nThey placed him amidst them, and made him the subject of their derision\r\nand mockery, during a whole day's entertainment, trying to exhaust his\r\npatience, but in vain, for he bore the whole with true christian\r\nfortitude. They spit in his face, pulled his nose, and pinched him in\r\nmost parts of his body. He was hunted like a wild beast, till ready to\r\nexpire with fatigue. They made him run the gauntlet between two ranks of\r\nthem, each striking him with a twig. He was beat with their fists. He\r\nwas beat with ropes. They scourged him with wires. He was beat with\r\ncudgels. They tied him up by the heels with his head downwards, till the\r\nblood started out of his nose, mouth, &c. They hung him by the right arm\r\ntill it was dislocated, and then had it set again. The same was repeated\r\nwith his left arm. Burning papers dipped in oil, were placed between his\r\nfingers and toes. His flesh was torn with red-hot pincers. He was put to\r\nthe rack. They pulled off the nails of his right hand. The same repeated\r\nwith his left hand. He was bastinadoed on his feet. A slit was made in\r\nhis right ear. The same repeated on his left ear. His nose was slit.\r\nThey whipped him through the town upon an ass. They made several\r\nincisions in his flesh. They pulled off the toe nails of his right foot.\r\nThe same repeated with his left foot. He was tied up by the loins, and\r\nsuspended for a considerable time. The teeth of his upper jaw were\r\npulled out. The same was repeated with his lower jaw. Boiling lead was\r\npoured upon his fingers. The same repeated with his toes. A knotted cord\r\nwas twisted about his forehead in such a manner as to force out his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of these horrid cruelties, particular care was taken\r\nthat his wounds should not mortify, and not to injure him mortally till\r\nthe last day, when the forcing out of his eyes proved his death.\r\n\r\nInnumerable were the other murders and depredations committed by those\r\nunfeeling brutes, and shocking to humanity were the cruelties which they\r\ninflicted on the poor Bohemian protestants. The winter being far\r\nadvanced, however, the high court of reformers, with their infernal band\r\nof military ruffians, thought proper to return to Prague; but on their\r\nway, meeting with a protestant pastor, they could not resist the\r\ntemptation of feasting their barbarous eyes with a new kind of cruelty,\r\nwhich had just suggested itself to the diabolical imagination of one of\r\nthe soldiers. This was to strip the minister naked, and alternately to\r\ncover him with ice and burning coals. This novel mode of tormenting a\r\nfellow-creature was immediately put into practice, and the unhappy\r\nvictim expired beneath the torments, which seemed to delight his inhuman\r\npersecutors.\r\n\r\nA secret order was soon after issued by the emperor, for apprehending\r\nall noblemen and gentlemen, who had been principally concerned in\r\nsupporting the protestant cause, and in nominating Frederic elector\r\nPalatine of the Rhine, to be king of Bohemia. These, to the number of\r\nfifty, were apprehended in one night, and at one hour, and brought from\r\nthe places where they were taken, to the castle of Prague, and the\r\nestates of those who were absent from the kingdom were confiscated,\r\nthemselves were made outlaws, and their names fixed upon a gallows, as\r\nmarks of public ignominy.\r\n\r\nThe high court of reformers then proceeded to try the fifty, who had\r\nbeen apprehended, and two apostate protestants were appointed to examine\r\nthem. These examinants asked a great number of unnecessary and\r\nimpertinent questions, which so exasperated one of the noblemen, who was\r\nnaturally of a warm temper, that he exclaimed opening his breast at the\r\nsame time, \"Cut here, search my heart, you shall find nothing but the\r\nlove of religion and liberty; those were the motives for which I drew my\r\nsword, and for those I am willing to suffer death.\"\r\n\r\nAs none of the prisoners would change their religion, or acknowledge\r\nthey had been in error, they were all pronounced guilty; but the\r\nsentence was referred to the emperor. When that monarch had read their\r\nnames, and an account of the respective accusations against them, he\r\npassed judgment on all, but in a different manner, as his sentences\r\nwere of four kinds, viz. death, banishment, imprisonment for life, and\r\nimprisonment during pleasure.\r\n\r\nTwenty being ordered for execution, were informed they might send for\r\nJesuits, monks, or friars, to prepare for the awful change they were to\r\nundergo; but that no protestants should be permitted to come near them.\r\nThis proposal they rejected, and strove all they could to comfort and\r\ncheer each other upon the solemn occasion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day appointed for the execution, a cannon was\r\nfired as a signal to bring the prisoners from the castle to the\r\nprincipal market-place, in which scaffolds were erected, and a body of\r\ntroops were drawn up to attend the tragic scene.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners left the castle with as much cheerfulness as if they had\r\nbeen going to an agreeable entertainment, instead of a violent death.\r\n\r\nExclusive of soldiers, Jesuits, priests, executioners, attendants, &c. a\r\nprodigious concourse of people attended, to see the exit of these\r\ndevoted martyrs, who were executed in the following order.\r\n\r\nLord Schilik was about fifty years of age, and was possessed of great\r\nnatural and acquired abilities. When he was told he was to be quartered,\r\nand his parts scattered in different places, he smiled with great\r\nserenity, saying, The loss of a sepulchre is but a trifling\r\nconsideration. A gentleman who stood by, crying, courage, my lord; he\r\nreplied, I have God's favour, which is sufficient to inspire any one\r\nwith courage: the fear of death does not trouble me; formerly I have\r\nfaced him in fields of battle to oppose Antichrist; and now dare face\r\nhim on a scaffold, for the sake of Christ. Having said a short prayer,\r\nhe told the executioner he was ready, who cut off his right hand and his\r\nhead, and then quartered him. His hand and head were placed upon the\r\nhigh tower of Prague, and his quarters distributed in different parts of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nLord Viscount Winceslaus, who had attained the age of seventy years, was\r\nequally respectable for learning, piety, and hospitality. His temper was\r\nso remarkably patient, that when his house was broke open, his property\r\nseized, and his estates confiscated, he only said, with great composure,\r\nThe Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away. Being asked why he\r\ncould engage in so dangerous a cause as that of attempting to support\r\nthe elector Palatine Frederic against the power of the emperor, he\r\nreplied, I acted strictly according to the dictates of my conscience,\r\nand, to this day, deem him my king. I am now full of years, and wish to\r\nlay down life, that I may not be a witness of the farther evils which\r\nare to attend my country. You have long thirsted for my blood, take it,\r\nfor God will be my avenger. Then approaching the block, he stroked his\r\nlong grey beard, and said, Venerable hairs, the greater honour now\r\nattends ye, a crown of martyrdom is your portion. Then laying down his\r\nhead, it was severed from his body at one stroke, and placed upon a pole\r\nin a conspicuous part of the city.\r\n\r\nLord Harant was a man of good sense, great piety, and much experience\r\ngained by travel, as he had visited the principal places in Europe,\r\nAsia, and Africa. Hence he was free from national prejudices and had\r\ncollected much knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe accusations against this nobleman, were, his being a protestant and\r\nhaving taken an oath of allegiance to Frederic, elector Palatine of the\r\nRhine, as king of Bohemia. When he came upon the scaffold he said, \"I\r\nhave travelled through many countries, and traversed various barbarous\r\nnations, yet never found so much cruelty as at home. I have escaped\r\ninnumerable perils both by sea and land, and surmounted inconceivable\r\ndifficulties, to suffer innocently in my native place. My blood is\r\nlikewise sought by those for whom I, and my forefathers, have hazarded\r\nour estates; but, Almighty God! forgive them, for they know not what\r\nthey do.\" He then went to the block, kneeled down, and exclaimed with\r\ngreat energy, into thy hands, O Lord! I commend my spirit; in thee have\r\nI always trusted; receive me, therefore, my blessed Redeemer. The fatal\r\nstroke was then given, and a period put to the temporary pains of this\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLord Frederic de Bile suffered as a protestant, and a promoter of the\r\nlate war; he met his fate with serenity, and only said, he wished well\r\nto the friends whom he left behind, forgave the enemies who caused his\r\ndeath, denied the authority of the emperor in that country, acknowledged\r\nFrederic to be the only true king of Bohemia, and hoped for salvation in\r\nthe merits of his blessed Redeemer.\r\n\r\nLord Henry Otto, when he first came upon the scaffold, seemed greatly\r\nconfounded, and said, with some asperity, as if addressing himself to\r\nthe emperor, \"Thou tyrant Ferdinand, your throne is established in\r\nblood; but if you kill my body, and disperse my members, they shall\r\nstill rise up in judgment against you.\" He then was silent, and having\r\nwalked about for some time, seemed to recover his fortitude, and growing\r\ncalm, said to a gentleman who stood near, I was, a few minutes since,\r\ngreatly discomposed, but now I feel my spirits revive; God be praised\r\nfor affording me such comfort; death no longer appears as the king of\r\nterrors, but seems to invite me to participate of some unknown joys.\r\nKneeling before the block, he said, Almighty God! to thee I commend my\r\nsoul, receive it for the sake of Christ, and admit it to the glory of\r\nthy presence. The executioner put this nobleman to considerable pain, by\r\nmaking several strokes before he severed the head from the body.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Rugenia was distinguished for his superior abilities, and\r\nunaffected piety. On the scaffold he said, \"We who drew our swords,\r\nfought only to preserve the liberties of the people, and to keep our\r\nconsciences sacred: as we were overcome, I am better pleased at the\r\nsentence of death, than if the emperor had given me life; for I find\r\nthat it pleases God to have his truth defended, not by our swords, but\r\nby our blood.\" He then went boldly to the block, saying, I shall now be\r\nspeedily with Christ, and received the crown of martyrdom with great\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nSir Gaspar Kaplitz was 86 years of age. When he came to the place of\r\nexecution, he addressed the principal officer thus: \"Behold a miserable\r\nancient man, who hath often entreated God to take him out of this wicked\r\nworld, but could not until now obtain his desire, for God reserved me\r\ntill these years to be a spectacle to the world and a sacrifice to\r\nhimself; therefore God's will be done.\" One of the officers told him, in\r\nconsideration of his great age, that if he would only ask pardon, he\r\nwould immediately receive it. \"Ask pardon, (exclaimed he) I will ask\r\npardon of God, whom I have frequently offended; but not of the emperor,\r\nto whom I never gave any offence should I sue for pardon, it might be\r\njustly suspected I had committed some crime for which I deserved this\r\ncondemnation. No, no, as I die innocent, and with a clear conscience, I\r\nwould not be separated from this noble company of martyrs:\" so saying,\r\nhe cheerfully resigned his neck to the block.\r\n\r\nProcopius Dorzecki on the scaffold said, \"We are now under the emperor's\r\njudgment; but in time he shall be judged, and we shall appear as\r\nwitnesses against him.\" Then taking a gold medal from his neck, which\r\nwas struck when the elector Frederic was crowned king of Bohemia, he\r\npresented it to one of the officers, at the same time uttering these\r\nwords, \"As a dying man, I request, if ever king Frederic is restored to\r\nthe throne of Bohemia, that you will give him this medal. Tell him, for\r\nhis sake, I wore it till death, and that now I willingly lay down my\r\nlife for God and my king.\" He then cheerfully laid down his head and\r\nsubmitted to the fatal blow.\r\n\r\nDionysius Servius was brought up a Roman catholic, but had embraced the\r\nreformed religion for some years. When upon the scaffold the Jesuits\r\nused their utmost endeavours to make him recant, and return to his\r\nformer faith, but he paid not the least attention to their exhortations.\r\nKneeling down he said, they may destroy my body, but cannot injure my\r\nsoul, that I commend to my Redeemer; and then patiently submitted to\r\nmartyrdom, being at that time fifty-six years of age.\r\n\r\nValentine Cockan, was a person of considerable fortune and eminence,\r\nperfectly pious and honest, but of trifling abilities; yet his\r\nimagination seemed to grow bright, and his faculties to improve on\r\ndeath's approach, as if the impending danger refined the understanding.\r\nJust before he was beheaded, he expressed himself with such eloquence,\r\nenergy, and precision, as greatly amazed those who knew his former\r\ndeficiency in point of capacity.\r\n\r\nTobias Steffick was remarkable for his affability and serenity of\r\ntemper. He was perfectly resigned to his fate, and a few minutes before\r\nhis death spoke in this singular manner, \"I have received, during the\r\nwhole course of my life, many favours from God; ought I not therefore\r\ncheerfully to take one bitter cup, when he thinks proper to present it?\r\nOr rather, ought I not to rejoice, that it is his will I should give up\r\na corrupted life for that of immortality!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Jessenius, an able student of physic, was accused of having spoken\r\ndisrespectful words of the emperor, of treason in swearing allegiance to\r\nthe elector Frederic, and of heresy in being a protestant: for the first\r\naccusation he had his tongue cut out; for the second he was beheaded;\r\nand for the third, and last, he was quartered, and the respective parts\r\nexposed on poles.\r\n\r\nChristopher Chober, as soon as he stepped upon the scaffold said, 'I\r\ncome in the name of God, to die for his glory; I have fought the good\r\nfight, and finished my course; so, executioner, do your office.' The\r\nexecutioner obeyed, and he instantly received the crown of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nNo person ever lived more respected, or died more lamented, than John\r\nShultis. The only words he spoke, before receiving the fatal stroke,\r\nwere, \"The righteous seem to die in the eyes of fools, but they only go\r\nto rest. Lord Jesus! thou hast promised that those who come to thee\r\nshall not be cast off. Behold, I am come; look on me, pity me, pardon my\r\nsins, and receive my soul.\"\r\n\r\nMaximilian Hostialick was famed for his learning, piety, and humanity.\r\nWhen he first came on the scaffold, he seemed exceedingly terrified at\r\nthe approach of death. The officer taking notice of his agitation, he\r\nsaid, \"Ah! sir, now the sins of my youth crowd upon my mind; but I hope\r\nGod will enlighten me, lest I sleep the sleep of death, and lest mine\r\nenemies say, we have prevailed.\" Soon after he said, \"I hope my\r\nrepentance is sincere, and will be accepted, in which case the blood of\r\nChrist will wash me from my crimes.\" He then told the officer he should\r\nrepeat the song of Simeon; at the conclusion of which the executioner\r\nmight do his duty. He, accordingly, said, Lord! now lettest thou thy\r\nservant depart in peace, according to thy word, for mine eyes have seen\r\nthy salvation; at which words his head was struck off at one blow.\r\n\r\nWhen John Kutnaur came to the place of execution, a Jesuit said to him,\r\n\"Embrace the Roman catholic faith, which alone can save and arm you\r\nagainst the terrors of death.\" To which he replied, \"Your superstitious\r\nfaith I abhor, it leads to perdition, and I wish for no other arms\r\nagainst the terrors of death, than a good conscience.\" The Jesuit turned\r\naway, saying, sarcastically, The protestants are impenetrable rocks. You\r\nare mistaken, said Kutnaur, it is Christ that is the rock, and we are\r\nfirmly fixed upon him.\r\n\r\nThis person not being born independent, but having acquired a fortune by\r\na mechanical employment, was ordered to be hanged.--Just before he was\r\nturned off, he said, \"I die, not for having committed any crime, but for\r\nfollowing the dictates of my own conscience, and defending my country\r\nand religion.\"\r\n\r\nSimeon Sussickey was father-in-law to Kutnaur, and like him, was ordered\r\nto be executed on a gallows. He went cheerfully to death and appeared\r\nimpatient to be executed, saying, \"Every moment delays me from entering\r\ninto the kingdom of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nNathaniel Wodnianskey was hanged for having supported the protestant\r\ncause, and the election of Frederic to the crown of Bohemia. At the\r\ngallows, the Jesuits did all in their power to induce him to renounce\r\nhis faith. Finding their endeavours ineffectual, one of them said, If\r\nyou will not abjure your heresy, at least repent of your rebellion! To\r\nwhich Wodnianskey replied, \"You take away our lives under a pretended\r\ncharge of rebellion; and, not content with that, seek to destroy our\r\nsouls; glut yourselves with blood, and be satisfied; but tamper not with\r\nour consciences.\"\r\n\r\nWodnianskey's own son then approached the gallows, and said to his\r\nfather, \"Sir, if life should be offered to you on condition of apostacy,\r\nI entreat you to remember Christ, and reject such pernicious overtures.\"\r\nTo this the father replied, \"It is very acceptable, my son, to be\r\nexhorted to constancy by you; but suspect me not; rather endeavour to\r\nconfirm in their faith your brothers, sisters, and children, and teach\r\nthem to imitate that constancy of which I shall leave them an example.\"\r\nHe had no sooner concluded these words than he was turned off, receiving\r\nthe crown of martyrdom with great fortitude.\r\n\r\nWinceslaus Gisbitzkey, during his whole confinement, had great hopes of\r\nlife given him, which made his friends fear for the safety of his soul.\r\nHe, however, continued steadfast in his faith, prayed fervently at the\r\ngallows, and met his fate with singular resignation.\r\n\r\nMartin Foster was an ancient cripple; the accusations against whom were,\r\nbeing charitable to heretics, and lending money to the elector Frederic.\r\nHis great wealth, however, seems to have been his principal crime; and\r\nthat he might be plundered of his treasures, was the occasion of his\r\nbeing ranked in this illustrious list of martyrs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PERSECUTIONS IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\nThe general persecutions in Germany were principally occasioned by the\r\ndoctrines and ministry of Martin Luther. Indeed, the pope was so\r\nterrified at the success of that courageous reformer, that he determined\r\nto engage the emperor, Charles the Fifth, at any rate, in the scheme to\r\nattempt their extirpation.\r\n\r\nTo this end;\r\n\r\n1. He gave the emperor two hundred thousand crowns in ready money.\r\n\r\n2. He promised to maintain twelve thousand foot, and five thousand\r\nhorse, for the space of six months, or during a campaign.\r\n\r\n3. He allowed the emperor to receive one-half the revenues of the clergy\r\nof the empire during the war.\r\n\r\n4. He permitted the emperor to pledge the abbey lands for five hundred\r\nthousand crowns, to assist in carrying on hostilities against the\r\nprotestants.\r\n\r\nThus prompted and supported, the emperor undertook the extirpation of\r\nthe protestants, against whom, indeed, he was particularly enraged\r\nhimself; and, for this purpose, a formidable army was raised in Germany,\r\nSpain and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe protestant princes, in the mean time, formed a powerful confederacy,\r\nin order to repel the impending blow. A great army was raised, and the\r\ncommand given to the elector of Saxony, and the landgrave of Hesse. The\r\nimperial forces were commanded by the emperor of Germany in person, and\r\nthe eyes of all Europe were turned on the event of the war.\r\n\r\nAt length the armies met, and a desperate engagement ensued, in which\r\nthe protestants were defeated, and the elector of Saxony, and landgrave\r\nof Hesse, both taken prisoners. This fatal blow was succeeded by a\r\nhorrid persecution, the severities of which were such, that exile might\r\nbe deemed a mild fate, and concealment in a dismal wood pass for\r\nhappiness. In such times a cave is a palace, a rock a bed of down, and\r\nwild roots delicacies.\r\n\r\nThose who were taken experienced the most cruel tortures the infernal\r\nimaginations could invent; and, by their constancy evinced that a real\r\nchristian can surmount every difficulty, and despise ever danger to\r\nacquire a crown of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nHenry Voes and John Esch, being apprehended as protestants, were brought\r\nto examination; when Voes, answering for himself and the other, gave the\r\nfollowing answers to some questions asked by a priest, who examined them\r\nby order of the magistracy.\r\n\r\n_Priest._ Were you not both, some years ago, Augustine friars?\r\n\r\n_Voes._ Yes.\r\n\r\n_Priest._ How came you to quit the bosom of the church of Rome?\r\n\r\n_Voes._ On account of her abominations.\r\n\r\n_Priest._ In what do you believe?\r\n\r\n_Voes._ In the Old and New Testaments.\r\n\r\n_Priest._ Do you believe in the writings of the fathers, and the decrees\r\nof the councils?\r\n\r\n_Voes._ Yes, if they agree with Scripture.\r\n\r\n_Priest._ Did not Martin Luther seduce you both?\r\n\r\n_Voes._ He seduced us even in the very same manner as Christ seduced the\r\napostles; that is, he made us sensible of the frailty of our bodies, and\r\nthe value of our souls.\r\n\r\nThis examination was sufficient; they were both condemned to the flames,\r\nand soon after, suffered with that manly fortitude which becomes\r\nchristians, when they receive a crown of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nHenry Sutphen, an eloquent and pious preacher, was taken out of his bed\r\nin the middle of the night, and compelled to walk barefoot a\r\nconsiderable way, so that his feet were terribly cut. He desired a\r\nhorse, but his conductors said, in derision, A horse for a heretic! no\r\nno, heretics may go barefoot. When he arrived at the place of his\r\ndestination, he was condemned to be burnt; but, during the execution,\r\nmany indignities were offered him, as those who attended not content\r\nwith what he suffered in the flames, cut and slashed him in a most\r\nterrible manner.\r\n\r\nMany were murdered at Halle; Middleburg being taken by storm all the\r\nprotestants were put to the sword, and great numbers were burned at\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nAn officer being sent to put a minister to death, pretended, when he\r\ncame to the clergyman's house, that his intentions were only to pay him\r\na visit. The minister, not suspecting the intended cruelty, entertained\r\nhis supposed guest in a very cordial manner. As soon as dinner was over,\r\nthe officer said to some of his attendants, \"Take this clergyman, and\r\nhang him.\" The attendants themselves were so shocked, after the civility\r\nthey had seen, that they hesitated to perform the commands of their\r\nmaster; and the minister said, \"Think what a sting will remain on your\r\nconscience, for thus violating the laws of hospitality.\" The officer,\r\nhowever, insisted upon being obeyed, and the attendants, with\r\nreluctance, performed the execrable office of executioners.\r\n\r\nPeter Spengler, a pious divine, of the town of Schalet, was thrown into\r\nthe river, and drowned. Before he was taken to the banks of the stream\r\nwhich was to become his grave, they led him to the market-place, that\r\nhis crimes might be proclaimed; which were, not going to mass, not\r\nmaking confession, and not believing in transubstantiation. After this\r\nceremony was over, he made a most excellent discourse to the people, and\r\nconcluded with a kind of hymn, of a very edifying nature.\r\n\r\nA protestant gentleman being ordered to lose his head for not renouncing\r\nhis religion, went cheerfully to the place of execution. A friar came to\r\nhim, and said these words in a low tone of voice, \"As you have a great\r\nreluctance publicly to abjure your faith, whisper your confession in my\r\near, and I will absolve your sins.\" To this the gentleman loudly\r\nreplied, \"Trouble me not, friar, I have confessed my sins to God, and\r\nobtained absolution through the merits of Jesus Christ.\" Then turning to\r\nthe executioner, he said, \"Let me not be pestered with these men, but\r\nperform your duty.\" On which his head was struck off at a single blow.\r\n\r\nWolfgang Scuch, and John Huglin, two worthy ministers, were burned, as\r\nwas Leonard Keyser, a student of the university of Wertembergh; and\r\nGeorge Carpenter, a Bavarian, was hanged for refusing to recant\r\nprotestantism.\r\n\r\nThe persecutions in Germany having subsided many years, again broke out\r\nin 1630, on account of the war between the emperor and the king of\r\nSweden, for the latter was a protestant prince, and consequently the\r\nprotestants of Germany espoused his cause, which greatly exasperated the\r\nemperor against them.\r\n\r\nThe imperialists having laid siege to the town of Passewalk, (which was\r\ndefended by the Swedes) took it by storm, and committed the most horrid\r\ncruelties on the occasion. They pulled down the churches, burnt the\r\nhouses, pillaged the properties, massacred the ministers, put the\r\ngarrison to the sword, hanged the townsmen, ravished the women,\r\nsmothered the children, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nA most bloody tragedy was transacted at Magdeburg, in the year 1631. The\r\ngenerals Tilly and Pappenheim, having taken that protestant city by\r\nstorm, upwards of 20,000 persons, without distinction of rank, sex, or\r\nage, were slain during the carnage, and 6,000 were drowned in attempting\r\nto escape over the river Elbe. After this fury had subsided, the\r\nremaining inhabitants were stripped naked, severely scourged, had their\r\nears cropped, and being yoked together like oxen were turned adrift.\r\n\r\nThe town of Hoxter was taken by the popish army, and all the inhabitants\r\nas well as the garrison, were put to the sword; when the houses being\r\nset on fire, the bodies were consumed in the flames.\r\n\r\nAt Griphenburg, when the imperial forces prevailed, they shut up the\r\nsenators in the senate-chamber, and surrounding it by lighted straw\r\nsuffocated them.\r\n\r\nFranhendal surrendered upon articles of capitulation, yet the\r\ninhabitants were as cruelly used as at other places, and at Heidelburg,\r\nmany were shut up in prison and starved.\r\n\r\nThe cruelties used by the imperial troops, under count Tilly in Saxony,\r\nare thus enumerated.\r\n\r\nHalf strangling, and recovering the persons again repeatedly. Rolling\r\nsharp wheels over the fingers and toes. Pinching the thumbs in a vice.\r\nForcing the most filthy things down the throat, by which many were\r\nchoked. Tying cords round the head so tight that the blood gushed out of\r\nthe eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. Fastening burning matches to the\r\nfingers, toes, ears, arms, legs, and even tongue. Putting powder in the\r\nmouth and setting fire to it, by which the head was shattered to pieces.\r\nTying bags of powder to all parts of the body, by which the person was\r\nblown up. Drawing cords backwards and forwards through the fleshy parts.\r\nMaking incisions with bodkins and knives in the skin. Running wires\r\nthrough the nose, ears, lips, &c. Hanging protestants up by the legs,\r\nwith their heads over a fire, by which they were smoked dried. Hanging\r\nup by one arm till it was dislocated. Hanging upon hooks by the ribs.\r\nForcing people to drink till they burst. Baking many in hot ovens.\r\nFixing weights to the feet, and drawing up several with pulleys.\r\nHanging, stifling, roasting, stabbing, frying, racking, ravishing,\r\nripping open, breaking the bones, rasping off the flesh, tearing with\r\nwild horses, drowning, strangling, burning, broiling, crucifying,\r\nimmuring, poisoning, cutting off tongues, nose, ears, &c. sawing off the\r\nlimbs, hacking to pieces, and drawing by the heels through the streets.\r\n\r\nThe enormous cruelties will be a perpetual stain on the memory of count\r\nTilly, who not only permitted, but even commanded the troops to put them\r\nin practice. Wherever he came, the most horrid barbarities, and cruel\r\ndepredations ensued: famine and conflagration marked his progress: for\r\nhe destroyed all the provisions he could not take with him, and burnt\r\nall the towns before he left them; so that the full result of his\r\nconquests were murder, poverty, and desolation.\r\n\r\nAn aged and pious divine they stripped naked, tied him on his back upon\r\na table, and fastened a large fierce cat upon his belly. They then\r\npricked and tormented the cat in such a manner, that the creature with\r\nrage tore his belly open, and knawed his bowels.\r\n\r\nAnother minister, and his family, were seized by these inhuman monsters;\r\nwhen they ravished his wife and daughter before his face; stuck his\r\ninfant son upon the point of a lance, and then surrounding him with his\r\nwhole library of books, they set fire to them, and he was consumed in\r\nthe midst of the flames.\r\n\r\nIn Hesse-Cassel some of the troops entered an hospital, in which were\r\nprincipally mad women, when stripping all the poor wretches naked, they\r\nmade them run about the streets for their diversion, and then put them\r\nall to death.\r\n\r\nIn Pomerania, some of the imperial troops entering a small town, seized\r\nupon all the young women, and girls of upwards of ten years, and then\r\nplacing their parents in a circle, they ordered them to sing psalms,\r\nwhile they ravished their children, or else they swore they would cut\r\nthem to pieces afterward. They then took all the married women who had\r\nyoung children, and threatened, if they did not consent to the\r\ngratification of their lusts, to burn their children before their faces\r\nin a large fire, which they had kindled for that purpose.\r\n\r\nA band of count Tilly's soldiers meeting a company of merchants\r\nbelonging to Basil, who were returning from the great market of\r\nStrasburg, they attempted to surround them: all escaped, however, but\r\nten, leaving their properties behind. The ten who were taken begged hard\r\nfor their lives; but the soldiers murdered them saying, You must die\r\nbecause you are heretics, and have got no money.\r\n\r\nThe same soldiers met with two countesses, who, together with some young\r\nladies, the daughters of one of them, were taking an airing in a landau.\r\nThe soldiers spared their lives, but treated them with the greatest\r\nindecency, and having stripped them all stark naked, bade the coachman\r\ndrive on.\r\n\r\nBy means and mediation of Great Britain, peace was at length restored to\r\nGermany, and the protestants remained unmolested for several years, till\r\nsome new disturbances broke out in the Palatinate which were thus\r\noccasioned.\r\n\r\nThe great church of the Holy Ghost, at Heidelburg, had, for many years,\r\nbeen shared equally by the protestants and Roman catholics in this\r\nmanner: the protestants performed divine service in the nave or body of\r\nthe church; and the Roman catholics celebrated mass in the choir. Though\r\nthis had been the custom time immemorial, the elector Palatinate, at\r\nlength, took it into his head not to suffer it any longer, declaring,\r\nthat as Heidelburg was the place of his residence, and the church of the\r\nHoly Ghost the cathedral of his principal city, divine service ought to\r\nbe performed only according to the rites of the church of which he was a\r\nmember. He then forbade the protestants to enter the church, and put the\r\npapists in possession of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe aggrieved people applied to the protestant powers for redress, which\r\nso much exasperated the elector, that he suppressed the Heidelburg\r\ncatechism. The protestant powers, however, unanimously agreed to demand\r\nsatisfaction, as the elector, by this conduct, had broke an article of\r\nthe treaty of Westphalia; and the courts of Great Britain, Prussia,\r\nHolland, &c., sent deputies to the elector, to represent the injustice\r\nof his proceedings, and to threaten, unless he changed his behaviour to\r\nthe protestants in the Palatinate, that they would treat their Roman\r\ncatholic subjects with the greatest severity. Many violent disputes took\r\nplace between the Protestant powers and those of the elector, and these\r\nwere greatly augmented by the following incident; the coach of the Dutch\r\nminister standing before the door of the resident sent by the prince of\r\nHesse, the host was by chance carrying to a sick person; the coachman\r\ntook not the least notice, which those who attended the host observing,\r\npulled him from his box, and compelled him to kneel: this violence to\r\nthe domestic of a public minister, was highly resented by all the\r\nprotestant deputies; and still more to heighten these differences, the\r\nprotestants presented to the deputies three additional articles of\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n1. That military executions were ordered against all protestant\r\nshoemakers who should refuse to contribute to the masses of St. Crispin.\r\n\r\n2. That the protestants were forbid to work on popish holydays even in\r\nharvest time, under very heavy penalties, which occasioned great\r\ninconveniences, and considerably prejudiced public business.\r\n\r\n3. That several protestant ministers had been dispossessed of their\r\nchurches, under pretence of their having been originally founded and\r\nbuilt by Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe protestant deputies, at length became so serious, as to intimate to\r\nthe elector, that force of arms should compel him to do the justice he\r\ndenied to their representations. This menace brought him to reason, as\r\nhe well knew the impossibility of carrying on a war against the powerful\r\nstates who threatened him. He, therefore, agreed, that the body of the\r\nchurch of the Holy Ghost should be restored to the protestants. He\r\nrestored the Heidelburg catechism, put the protestant ministers again in\r\npossession of the churches of which they had been dispossessed, allowed\r\nthe protestants to work on popish holydays, and, ordered, that no person\r\nshould be molested for not kneeling when the host passed by.\r\n\r\nThese things he did through fear; but to show his resentment to his\r\nprotestant subjects, in other circumstances where protestant states had\r\nno right to interfere, he totally abandoned Heidelburg, removing all the\r\ncourts of justice to Manheim, which was entirely inhabited by Roman\r\ncatholics. He likewise built a new palace there, making it his place of\r\nresidence; and, being followed by the Roman catholics of Heidelburg,\r\nManheim became a flourishing place.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the protestants of Heidelburg sunk into poverty and\r\nmany of them became so distressed, as to quit their native country, and\r\nseek an asylum in protestant states. A great number of these coming into\r\nEngland, in the time of queen Anne, were cordially received there, and\r\nmet with a most humane assistance, both by public and private donations.\r\n\r\nIn 1732, above 30,000 protestants were, contrary to the treaty of\r\nWestphalia, driven from the archbishopric of Saltzburg. They went away\r\nto the depth of winter, with scarce clothes to cover them, and without\r\nprovisions, not having permission to take any thing with them. The cause\r\nof these poor people not being publicly espoused by such states as could\r\nobtain them redress, they emigrated to various protestant countries, and\r\nsettled in places where they could enjoy the free exercise of their\r\nreligion, without hurting their consciences, and live free from the\r\ntrammels of popish superstition, and the chains of papal tyranny.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Persecutions in the Netherlands._\r\n\r\nThe light of the gospel having successfully spread over the Netherlands,\r\nthe pope instigated the emperor to commence a persecution against the\r\nprotestants; when many thousand fell martyrs to superstitious malice and\r\nbarbarous bigotry, among whom the most remarkable were the following:\r\n\r\nWendelinuta, a pious protestant widow, was apprehended on account of her\r\nreligion, when several monks, unsuccessfully, endeavoured to persuade\r\nher to recant. As they could not prevail, a Roman catholic lady of her\r\nacquaintance desired to be admitted to the dungeon in which she was\r\nconfined, and promised to exert herself strenuously towards inducing the\r\nprisoner to abjure the reformed religion. When she was admitted to the\r\ndungeon, she did her utmost to perform the task she had undertaken; but\r\nfinding her endeavours ineffectual, she said, Dear Wendelinuta, if you\r\nwill not embrace our faith, at least keep the things which you profess\r\nsecret within your own bosom, and strive to prolong your life. To which\r\nthe widow replied, Madam you know not what you say; for with the heart\r\nwe believe to righteousness, but with the tongue confession is made unto\r\nsalvation. As she positively refused to recant, her goods were\r\nconfiscated, and she was condemned to be burnt. At the place of\r\nexecution a monk held a cross to her, and bade her kiss and worship God.\r\nTo which she answered, \"I worship no wooden god, but the eternal God who\r\nis in heaven.\" She was then executed, but through the before-mentioned\r\nRoman catholic lady, the favour was granted, that she should be\r\nstrangled before fire was put to the fagots.\r\n\r\nTwo protestant clergymen were burnt at Colen; a tradesman of Antwerp,\r\nnamed Nicholas, was tied up in a sack, thrown into the river, and\r\ndrowned; and Pistorius, a learned student, was carried to the market of\r\na Dutch village in a fool's coat, and committed to the flames.\r\n\r\nSixteen protestants having received sentence to be beheaded, a\r\nprotestant minister was ordered to attend the execution. This gentleman\r\nperformed the function of his office with great propriety, exhorted them\r\nto repentance, and gave them comfort in the mercies of their Redeemer.\r\nAs soon as the sixteen were beheaded, the magistrate cried out to the\r\nexecutioner, \"There is another stroke remaining yet; you must behead the\r\nminister; he can never die at a better time than with such excellent\r\nprecepts in his mouth, and such laudable examples before him.\" He was\r\naccordingly beheaded, though even many of the Roman catholics themselves\r\nreprobated this piece of treacherous and unnecessary cruelty.\r\n\r\nGeorge Scherter, a minister of Saltzburg, was apprehended and committed\r\nto prison for instructing his flock in the knowledge of the gospel.\r\nWhile he was in confinement he wrote a confession of his faith; soon\r\nafter which he was condemned, first to be beheaded, and afterward to be\r\nburnt to ashes. In his way to the place of execution he said to the\r\nspectators, \"That you may know I die a true christian, I will give you a\r\nsign.\" This was indeed verified in a most singular manner; for after his\r\nhead was cut off, the body lying a short space of time with the belly to\r\nthe ground, it suddenly turned upon the back, when the right foot\r\ncrossed over the left, as did also the right arm over the left: and in\r\nthis manner it remained till it was committed to the flames.\r\n\r\nIn Louviana, a learned man, named Percinal, was murdered in prison; and\r\nJustus Insparg was beheaded, for having Luther's sermons in his\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nGiles Tilleman, a cutler of Brussels, was a man of great humanity and\r\npiety. Among others he was apprehended as a protestant, and many\r\nendeavours were made by the monks to persuade him to recant. He had\r\nonce, by accident, a fair opportunity of escaping from prison and being\r\nasked why he did not avail himself of it, he replied, \"I would not do\r\nthe keepers so much injury, as they must have answered for my absence,\r\nhad I gone away.\" When he was sentenced to be burnt, he fervently\r\nthanked God for granting him an opportunity, by martyrdom, to glorify\r\nhis name. Perceiving, at the place of execution, a great quantity of\r\nfagots, he desired the principal part of them might be given to the\r\npoor, saying, a small quantity will suffice to consume me. The\r\nexecutioner offered to strangle him before the fire was lighted, but he\r\nwould not consent, telling him that he defied the flames and, indeed, he\r\ngave up the ghost with such composure amidst them that he hardly seemed\r\nsensible of their effects.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1543 and 1544, the persecution was carried on throughout all\r\nFlanders, in a most violent and cruel manner. Some were condemned to\r\nperpetual imprisonment, others to perpetual banishment but most were put\r\nto death either by hanging, drowning, immuring, burning, the rack, or\r\nburying alive.\r\n\r\nJohn de Boscane, a zealous protestant, was apprehended on account of his\r\nfaith, in the city of Antwerp. On his trial, he steadfastly professed\r\nhimself to be of the reformed religion, which occasioned his immediate\r\ncondemnation. The magistrate, however, was afraid to put him to death\r\npublicly, as he was popular through his great generosity, and almost\r\nuniversally beloved for his inoffensive life, and exemplary piety. A\r\nprivate execution being determined on, an order was given to drown him\r\nin prison. The executioner, accordingly, put him in a large tub; but\r\nBoscane struggling, and getting his head above the water, the\r\nexecutioner stabbed him with a dagger in several places, till he\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nJohn de Buisons, another protestant, was, about the same time, secretly\r\napprehended, and privately executed at Antwerp. The number of\r\nprotestants being great in that city, and the prisoner much respected,\r\nthe magistrates feared an insurrection, and for that reason ordered him\r\nto be beheaded in prison.\r\n\r\nA. D. 1568, three persons were apprehended in Antwerp, named Scoblant,\r\nHues, and Coomans. During their confinement they behaved with great\r\nfortitude and cheerfulness, confessing that the hand of God appeared in\r\nwhat had befallen them, and bowing down before the throne of his\r\nprovidence. In an epistle to some worthy protestants, they express\r\nthemselves in the following words; Since it is the will of the Almighty\r\nthat we should suffer for his name, and be persecuted for the sake of\r\nhis gospel, we patiently submit, and are joyful upon the occasion;\r\nthough the flesh may rebel against the spirit, and hearken to the\r\ncouncil of the old serpent, yet the truths of the gospel shall prevent\r\nsuch advice from being taken, and Christ shall bruise the serpent's\r\nhead. We are not comfortless to confinement, for we have faith; we fear\r\nnot affliction, for we have hope; and we forgive our enemies, for we\r\nhave charity. Be not under apprehensions for us, we are happy in\r\nconfinement through the promises of God, glory in our bonds, and exult\r\nin being thought worthy to suffer for the sake of Christ. We desire not\r\nto be released, but to be blessed with fortitude, we ask not liberty,\r\nbut the power of perseverance; and wish for no change in our condition,\r\nbut that which places a crown of martyrdom upon our heads.\r\n\r\nScoblant was first brought to his trial; when, persisting in the\r\nprofession of his faith, he received sentence of death. On his return to\r\nprison, he earnestly requested the jailer not to permit any friar to\r\ncome near him; saying, \"They can do me no good, but may greatly disturb\r\nme. I hope my salvation is already sealed in heaven, and that the blood\r\nof Christ, in which I firmly put my trust, hath washed me from my\r\niniquities. I am now going to throw off this mantle of clay, to be clad\r\nin robes of eternal glory, by whose celestial brightness I shall be\r\nfreed from all errors. I hope I may be the last martyr to papal tyranny,\r\nand the blood already spilt found sufficient to quench the thirst of\r\npopish cruelty; that the church of Christ may have rest here, as his\r\nservants will hereafter.\" On the day of execution, he took a pathetic\r\nleave of his fellow-prisoners. At the stake he fervently said the Lord's\r\nPrayer, and sung the fortieth psalm; then commending his soul to God, he\r\nwas burnt alive.\r\n\r\nHues, soon after, died in prison; upon which occasion Coomans wrote thus\r\nto his friends, \"I am now deprived of my friends and companions;\r\nScoblant is martyred, and Hues dead, by the visitation of the Lord; yet\r\nI am not alone, I have with me the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of\r\nJacob; he is my comfort, and shall be my reward. Pray unto God to\r\nstrengthen me to the end, as I expect every hour to be freed from this\r\ntenement of clay.\"\r\n\r\nOn his trial he freely confessed himself of the reformed religion,\r\nanswered with a manly fortitude to every charge against him, and proved\r\nthe scriptural part of his answers from the gospel. The judge told him\r\nthe only alternatives were, recantation or death; and concluded by\r\nsaying, \"Will you die for the faith you profess?\" To which Coomans\r\nreplied, \"I am not only willing to die, but to suffer the most\r\nexcruciating torments for it; after which my soul shall receive its\r\nconfirmation from God himself, in the midst of eternal glory.\" Being\r\ncondemned, he went cheerfully to the place of execution, and died with\r\nthe most manly fortitude, and christian resignation.\r\n\r\nWilliam Nassau fell a sacrifice to treachery, being assassinated in the\r\nfifty-first year of his age, by Beltazar Gerard, a native of Franche\r\nCompte, in the province of Burgundy. This murderer, in hopes of a reward\r\nhere and hereafter, for killing an enemy to the king of Spain and an\r\nenemy to the catholic religion, undertook to destroy the prince of\r\nOrange. Having procured fire arms, he watched him as he passed through\r\nthe great hall of his palace to dinner, and demanded a passport. The\r\nprincess of Orange, observing that the assassin spoke with a hollow and\r\nconfused voice, asked who he was? saying, she did not like his\r\ncountenance. The prince answered, it was one that demanded a passport,\r\nwhich he should presently have.\r\n\r\nNothing farther passed before dinner, but on the return of the prince\r\nand princess through the same hall, after dinner was over, the assassin,\r\nstanding concealed as much as possible by one of the pillars, fired at\r\nthe prince, the balls entering at the left side, and passing through the\r\nright, wounding in their passage the stomach and vital parts. On\r\nreceiving the wounds, the prince only said, Lord, have mercy upon my\r\nsoul, and upon these poor people, and then expired immediately.\r\n\r\nThe lamentations throughout the United Provinces were general, on\r\naccount of the death of the prince of Orange; and the assassin who was\r\nimmediately taken, received sentence to be put to death in the most\r\nexemplary manner, yet such was his enthusiasm, or folly that when his\r\nflesh was torn by red-hot pincers, he coolly said, If I was at liberty,\r\nI would commit such an action over again.\r\n\r\nThe prince of Orange's funeral was the grandest ever seen in the Low\r\nCountries, and perhaps the sorrow for his death the most sincere, as he\r\nleft behind him the character he honestly deserved, viz. that of Father\r\nof his people.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, multitudes were murdered in different parts of Flanders; in\r\nthe city of Valence, in particular, fifty-seven of the principal\r\ninhabitants were butchered in one day, for refusing to embrace the\r\nRomish superstition; and great numbers were suffered to languish in\r\nconfinement, till they perished through the inclemency of their\r\ndungeons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE PERSECUTIONS IN LITHUANIA AND POLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe persecutions in Lithuania began in 1648, and were carried on with\r\ngreat severity by the Cossacks and Tartars. The cruelty of the Cossacks\r\nwas much, that even the Tartars, at last, grew ashamed of it, and\r\nrescued some of the intended victims from their hands.\r\n\r\nThe barbarities exercised were these: skinning alive, cutting off hands,\r\ntaking out the bowels, cutting the flesh open, putting out the eyes,\r\nbeheading, scalping, cutting off feet, boring the shin bones, pouring\r\nmelted lead into the flesh, hanging, stabbing, and sending to perpetual\r\nbanishment.\r\n\r\nThe Russians, taking advantage of the devastations which had been made\r\nin the country, and of its incapability of defence, entered it with a\r\nconsiderable army, and, like a flood, bore down all before them. Every\r\nthing they met with was an object of destruction; they razed cities,\r\ndemolished castles, ruined fortresses, sacked towns, burnt villages, and\r\nmurdered people. The ministers of the gospel were peculiarly marked out\r\nas the objects of their displeasure, though every worthy christian was\r\nliable to the effects of their cruelty.\r\n\r\nAs Lithuania recovered itself after one persecution, succeeding enemies\r\nagain destroyed it. The Swedes, the Prussians, and the Courlanders,\r\ncarried fire and sword through it, and continual calamities, for some\r\nyears, attended that unhappy district. It was then attacked by the\r\nprince of Transylvania, who had in his army, exclusive of his own\r\nTransylvanians, Hungarians, Moldavians, Servians, Walachians, &c. These,\r\nas far as they penetrated, wasted the country, destroyed the churches,\r\nrifled the nobility, burnt the houses, enslaved the healthy, and\r\nmurdered the sick.\r\n\r\nA clergyman, who wrote an account of the misfortunes of Lithuania, in\r\nthe seventeenth century, says, \"In consideration of these extremities,\r\nwe cannot but adore the judgment of God poured upon us for our sins, and\r\ndeplore our sad condition. Let us hope for a deliverance from his mercy,\r\nand wish for restitution in his benevolence. Though we are brought low,\r\nthough we are wasted, troubled, and terrified, yet his compassion is\r\ngreater than our calamities, and his goodness superior to our\r\nafflictions. Our neighbours hate us at present, as much as our more\r\ndistant enemies did before; they persecute the remnant of us still\r\nremaining, deprive us of our few churches left, banish our preachers,\r\nabuse our schoolmasters, treat us with contempt, and oppress us in the\r\nmost opprobrious manner. In all our afflictions the truth of the gospel\r\nshone among us, and gave us comfort; and we only wished for the grace of\r\nJesus Christ, (not only to ourselves, but to soften the hearts of our\r\nenemies) and the sympathy of our fellow christians.\"\r\n\r\nThe protestants of Poland were persecuted in a dreadful manner. The\r\nministers in particular were treated with the most unexampled barbarity;\r\nsome having their tongues cut out, because they had preached the gospel\r\ntruths; others being deprived of their sight on account of their having\r\nread the bible; and great numbers were cut to pieces for not recanting.\r\n\r\nPrivate persons were put to death by various methods; the most cruel\r\nbeing usually preferred. Women were murdered without the least regard to\r\ntheir sex; and the persecutors even went so far as to cut off the heads\r\nof sucking babes, and fasten them to the breasts of the mothers.\r\n\r\nEven the solemnity of the grave did not exempt the bodies of protestants\r\nfrom the malice of persecutors; for they sacrilegiously dug up the\r\nbodies of many eminent persons, and either cut them to pieces, and\r\nexposed them to be devoured by birds and beasts, or hung them up in\r\nconspicuous or public places.\r\n\r\nThe city of Lesna particularly suffered in this persecution; for being\r\nbesieged and taken, the inhabitants were all put to the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE PERSECUTIONS IN CHINA AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristianity was first established in China by three Italian\r\nmissionaries, called Roger the Neapolitan, Pasis of Bologne, and Matthew\r\nRicci of Mazerata, in the marquisate of Ancona. These entered China\r\nabout the beginning of the sixteenth century, being well circumstanced\r\nto perform their important commission with success, as they had\r\npreviously studied the Chinese language.\r\n\r\nThese three missionaries were very assiduous to the discharge of their\r\nduty; but Roger and Pasis returning to Europe in a few years, the whole\r\nlabour fell upon Ricci, who aimed to establish christianity with a\r\ndegree of zeal that was indefatigable.\r\n\r\nRicci, though much disposed to indulge his converts as far as possible,\r\nmade great hesitation at their ceremonies, which seemed to amount to\r\nidolatry. At length, after eighteen years consideration, he began to\r\nsoften his opinion, and tolerated all the parts of those customs which\r\nwere ordered by the laws of the empire, but strictly enjoined his\r\nChinese christians to omit the rest.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of christianity in China, when the christian\r\nchurch established there was governed only by Ricci, who, by his\r\nmoderation, made innumerable converts. In 1630, however, his tranquility\r\nwas disturbed by the arrival of some new missionaries, these being\r\nunacquainted with the Chinese customs, manners, and language, and with\r\nthe arguments on which Ricci's toleration was founded, were astonished\r\nwhen they saw christian converts prostrate before Confucius and the\r\ntables of their ancestors, and condemned the custom accordingly.\r\n\r\nA warm controversy now ensued between Ricci, seconded by his converts,\r\nand the new missionaries; and the latter wrote an account of the whole\r\naffair to the pope, and the society for the propagation of the christian\r\nfaith. The society soon pronounced, that the ceremonies were idolatrous\r\nand intolerable, and the pope confirmed the sentence. In this both the\r\nsociety and the pope were excusable, as the matter had been\r\nmisrepresented to them; for the enemies of Ricci had affirmed the halls,\r\nin which the ceremonies were performed, to be temples, and the\r\nceremonies themselves idolatrous sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe sentence above mentioned was sent over to China, but treated with\r\ncontempt, and matters remained as they were for some time. At length, a\r\ntrue representation of the matter was sent over, setting forth, that the\r\nChinese customs and ceremonies alluded to were entirely free from\r\nidolatry, being merely political, and tending only to the peace and\r\nwelfare of the empire. The pope, finding that he had made himself\r\nridiculous, by confirming an absurd sentence upon a false report, wanted\r\nto get rid of the affair, and therefore referred the representation to\r\nthe inquisition, which reversed the sentence immediately, at the private\r\ndesire of the pope, as may be naturally supposed.\r\n\r\nThe christian church, for all these divisions, flourished in China till\r\nthe death of the first Tartar emperor, whose successor was a minor.\r\nDuring this minority of the young emperor Cang-hi, the regents and\r\nnobles conspired to extirpate the christian religion. The execution of\r\nthis design was begun with expedition, and carried on with severity, so\r\nthat every christian teacher in China, as well as those who professed\r\nthe faith, were struck with amazement. John Adam Schall, a German\r\necclesiastic, and one of the principals of the mission, was thrown into\r\na dungeon in the year 1664, being then in the seventy-fourth year of his\r\nage, and narrowly escaped with his life.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing year, viz. 1665, the ministers of state publicly and\r\nunanimously resolved, and made a decree specifying, viz.\r\n\r\n1. That the christian doctrines were false.\r\n\r\n2. That they were dangerous to the interest of the empire.\r\n\r\n3. That they should not be practised under pain of death.\r\n\r\nThe publication of this decree occasioned a furious general persecution,\r\nin which some were put to death, many were ruined, and all were, in some\r\nmanner, oppressed. This decree was general, and the persecution\r\nuniversal accordingly throughout the empire; for, previous to this, the\r\nchristians had been partially persecuted at different times, and in\r\ndifferent provinces.\r\n\r\nFour years after, viz. 1669, the young emperor was declared of age, and\r\ntook the reins of government upon himself, when the persecution\r\nimmediately ceased by his order.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An account of the Persecutions in Japan._\r\n\r\nChristianity was first introduced into the idolatrous empire of Japan by\r\nsome Portuguese missionaries in the year of our Lord 1552, and their\r\nendeavours in making converts to the light of the gospel met with a\r\ndegree of success equal to their most sanguine wishes.\r\n\r\nThis continued till the year 1616, when the missionaries being accused\r\nof having concerned themselves in politics, and formed a plan to subvert\r\nthe government, and dethrone the emperor, great jealousies subsisted\r\ntill 1622, when the court ordered a dreadful persecution to commence\r\nagainst both foreign and native christians. Such was the rage of this\r\npersecution, that, during the first four years, no less than 20,570\r\nchristians were massacred. The public profession of christianity was\r\nprohibited under pain of death, and the churches were shut up by an\r\nexpress edict.\r\n\r\nMany who were informed against, as privately professing christianity,\r\nsuffered martyrdom with great heroism. The persecution continued many\r\nyears, when the remnant of the innumerable christians, with which Japan\r\nabounded, to the number of 37,000 souls, retired to the town and castle\r\nof Siniabara, in the island of Xinio, where they determined to make a\r\nstand, to continue in their faith, and to defend themselves to the very\r\nlast extremity.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese army pursued the christians, and laid siege to the place.\r\nThe christians defended themselves with great bravery, and held out\r\nagainst the besiegers for the space of three months, but were at length\r\ncompelled to surrender, when men, women and children, were\r\nindiscriminately murdered; and christianity, in their martyrdoms,\r\nentirely extirpated from Japan.\r\n\r\nThis event took place on the 12th of April, 1638, since which period no\r\nchristians but the Dutch are allowed to land in the empire, and even\r\nthey are obliged to conduct themselves with the greatest precaution, and\r\nto carry on their commerce with the utmost circumspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An account of the Persecutions against the Christians in Abyssinia, or\r\nEthiopia._\r\n\r\nTowards the conclusion of the fifteenth century, and soon after the\r\ndiscovery of the Cape of Good Hope, some Portuguese missionaries made a\r\nvoyage to Abyssinia, and were indefatigable in propagating the Roman\r\ncatholic doctrine among the Abyssinians, who professed christianity\r\nbefore the arrival of the missionaries.\r\n\r\nThe priests, employed in this mission, gained such an influence at\r\ncourt, that the emperor consented to abolish the established rites of\r\nthe Ethiopian church, and to admit those of Rome. He soon after\r\nconsented to receive a patriarch from Rome, and to acknowledge the\r\npope's supremacy.\r\n\r\nMany of the most powerful lords, and a majority of the people who\r\nprofessed the primitive christianity, as first established in Abyssinia,\r\nopposed these innovations, and took up arms against the emperor.--Thus,\r\nby the artifices of the court of Rome, and its emissaries, a most\r\nfurious civil war was begun, and the whole empire thrown into commotion.\r\nThis war was carried on through several reigns, its continuance being\r\nabove 100 years, and the court constantly siding with the Roman\r\ncatholics, the primitive christians of Abyssinia were severely\r\npersecuted, and multitudes perished by the most inhuman means.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An account of the Persecutions against the Christians in Turkey._\r\n\r\nMahomet, (the impostor) in the infancy of his new religion, tolerated\r\nchristianity through a political motive, as he was sensible, that even\r\nin those early times it had several powerful espousers among the\r\nprinces, who were his cotemporaries. As a proof that this was his sole\r\nview, as soon as he found his doctrine was established on a more\r\npermanent situation, he altered his forbearance to a system of the most\r\nrigid and barbarous persecution; which diabolical plan he has\r\nparticularly recommended to his misguided followers, in that part of his\r\nAlcoran, entitled The Chapter of the Sword; and as proofs of the blind\r\nzeal his followers have adopted from his infernal tenets, the many\r\nbloody battles of the Turks with the whole of the professors of Christ's\r\ngospel, and their cruel massacres of them at various periods,\r\nsufficiently evince.\r\n\r\nConstantine was, in the year 1453, besieged in Constantinople, by\r\nMahomet the Second, with an army of 300,000 men, when, after a bloody\r\nsiege of about six week, on the 29th of May, 1453, it fell into the\r\nhands of the infidels, after being an imperial christian city for some\r\ncenturies; and the Turks have, to this day, retained possession of it,\r\nas well as of the adjoining suburb of Pera.\r\n\r\nOn entering Constantinople, the Turks exercised on the wretched\r\nchristians the most unremitting barbarity, destroying them by every\r\nmethod the most hellish cruelty could invent, or the most unfeeling\r\nheart could practise: some they roasted alive on spits, others they\r\nflayed alive, and in that horrid manner left to expire with hunger; many\r\nwere sawed asunder, and others torn to pieces by horses.--For full three\r\ndays and nights the Turks were striving to exceed each other in the\r\nexercise of their shocking carnage, and savage barbarity; murdering,\r\nwithout distinction of age or sex, all they met, and brutishly violating\r\nthe chastity of women, of every distinction and age.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1529, Solyman the First retook Buda from the christians,\r\nand showed the most horrible persecution of the inhabitants; some had\r\ntheir eyes torn out, others their hands, ears, and noses cut off, and\r\nthe children their privities, the virgins were deflowered, the matrons\r\nhad their breasts cut off, and such as were pregnant had their wombs\r\nripped open, and their unborn babes thrown into the flames. Not content\r\nwith this, he repeated these horrid examples all the way on his march to\r\nVienna, which he ineffectually besieged, during which, this diabolical\r\nbarbarian, having made a body of christians prisoners, he sent three of\r\nthem into the city to relate the great strength of his army, and the\r\nrest he ordered to be torn limb from limb by wild horses in sight of\r\ntheir christian brethren, who could only lament by their cries and tears\r\ntheir dreadful fate.\r\n\r\nIn many places the tender children were in sight of their wretched\r\nparents torn to pieces by beasts, others dragged at horses' heels, some\r\nfamished with hunger, and others buried up to their necks in earth, and\r\nin that manner left to perish. In short, were we to relate the\r\ninnumerable massacres and deplorable tragedies acted by the infidels,\r\nthe particulars would at least make a volume of themselves, and from\r\ntheir horrid similarity be not only shocking, but disgusting to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecutions and Oppressions in Georgia and Mingrelia._\r\n\r\nThe Georgians, are christians, and being very handsome people, the Turks\r\nand Persians persecute them by the most cruel mode of taxation ever\r\ninvented, namely, in lieu of money, they compel them to deliver up their\r\nchildren for the following purposes.\r\n\r\nThe females to increase the number of concubines in their seraglios, to\r\nserve as maids of honour to sultanas, the ladies of bashaws, &c., and to\r\nbe sold to merchants of different nations, by whom the price is\r\nproportioned to the beauty of the purchased fair one.\r\n\r\nThe males are used as mutes and eunuchs in the seraglio, as clerks in\r\nthe offices of state, and as soldiers in the army.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Georgia is Mingrelia, a country likewise inhabited by\r\nchristians, who are persecuted and oppressed in the same manner as the\r\nGeorgians by the Turks and Persians, their children being extorted from\r\nthem, or they murdered for refusing to consent to the sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Persecutions in the States of Barbary._\r\n\r\nIn Algiers the christians are treated with particular severity; as the\r\nAlgerines are some of the most perfidious, as well as the most cruel of\r\nall the inhabitants of Barbary. By paying a most exorbitant fine, some\r\nchristians are allowed the title of Free christians, and these are\r\npermitted to dress in the fashion of their respective countries, but the\r\nchristian slaves are obliged to wear a coarse gray suit and a seaman's\r\ncap.\r\n\r\nThe punishments among the Algerines are various, viz.\r\n\r\n1. If they join any of the natives in open rebellion, they are strangled\r\nwith a bowstring, or hanged on an iron hook.\r\n\r\n2. If they speak against Mahomet, they must either turn Mahometan, or be\r\nimpaled alive.\r\n\r\n3. If they turn christians again, after having changed to the Mahometan\r\npersuasion, they are roasted alive, or thrown from the city walls, and\r\ncaught upon large sharp hooks, where they hang in a miserable manner\r\nseveral days, and expire in the most exquisite tortures.\r\n\r\n4. If they kill a Turk, they are burnt.\r\n\r\n5. Those christians who attempt to escape from slavery, and are retaken,\r\nsuffer death in the following manner, which is equally singular and\r\nbrutal: the criminal is hung naked on a high gallows, by two hooks, the\r\none fastened quite through the palm of one hand, and the other through\r\nthe sole of the opposite foot, where he is left till death relieves him\r\nfrom his cruel sufferings.\r\n\r\nOther punishments, for trifling crimes committed by the christians, are\r\nleft to the discretion of the respective judges, who being usually of\r\nmalicious and vindictive dispositions, decree them in the most inhuman\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn Tunis, if a christian slave is caught in attempting to escape, his\r\nlimbs are all broken, and if he murders his master, he is fastened to\r\nthe tail of a horse, and dragged about the streets till he expires.\r\n\r\nMorocco and Fez conjointly form an empire, and are together the most\r\nconsiderable of the Barbary states. In this empire christian slaves are\r\ntreated with the greatest cruelty: the rich have exorbitant ransoms\r\nfixed upon them; the poor are hard worked, and half starved sometimes\r\nmurdered by the emperor, or their masters, for mere amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Persecutions in Spanish America._\r\n\r\nThe bloody tenets of the Roman catholic persuasion, and the cruel\r\ndisposition of the votaries of that church, cannot be more amply\r\ndisplayed or truly depicted, than by giving an authentic and simple\r\nnarrative of the horrid barbarities exercised by the Spaniards on the\r\ninnocent and unoffending natives of America. Indeed, the barbarities\r\nwere such, that they would scarce seen credible from their enormity, and\r\nthe victims so many, that they would startle belief by their numbers, if\r\nthe facts were not indisputably ascertained, and the circumstances\r\nadmitted by their own writers, some of whom have even gloried in their\r\ninhumanity, and, as Roman catholics, deemed these atrocious actions\r\nmeritorious, which would make a protestant shudder to relate.\r\n\r\nThe West Indies, and the vast continent of America, were discovered by\r\nthat celebrated navigator, Christopher Columbus, in 1492. This\r\ndistinguished commander landed first in the large island of St. Domingo,\r\nor Hispaniola, which was at that time exceedingly populous, but this\r\npopulation was of very little consequence, the inoffensive inhabitants\r\nbeing murdered by multitudes, as soon as the Spaniards gained a\r\npermanent footing on the island. Blind superstition, bloody bigotry, and\r\ncraving avarice, rendered that, in the course of years, a dismal desert,\r\nwhich, at the arrival of the Spaniards, seemed to appear as an earthly\r\nparadise; so that at present there is scarce a remnant of the ancient\r\nnatives remaining.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Guatemala, a country of America, were used with great\r\nbarbarity. They were formerly active and valiant, but from ill usage and\r\noppression, grew slothful, and so dispirited, that they not only\r\ntrembled at the sight of fire-arms, but even at the very looks of a\r\nSpaniard. Some were so plunged into despair, that after returning home\r\nfrom labouring hard for their cruel taskmasters, and receiving only\r\ncontemptuous language and stripes for their pains, they have sunk down\r\nin their cabins, with a full resolution to prefer death to such slavery;\r\nand, in the bitterness of their anguish, have refused all sustenance\r\ntill they perished.\r\n\r\nBy repeated barbarities, and the most execrable cruelties, the\r\nvindictive and merciless Spaniards not only depopulated Hispaniola,\r\nPorto-Rico, Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahama islands, but destroyed above\r\n12,000,000 of souls upon the continent of America, in the space of forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe cruel methods by which they massacred and butchered the poor\r\nnatives, were innumerable, and of the most diabolical nature.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards stripped a large and very populous town of all its\r\ninhabitants, whom they drove to the mines, leaving all the children\r\nbehind them, without the least idea of providing for their subsistence,\r\nby which inhuman proceeding six thousand helpless infants perished.\r\n\r\nWhenever the people of any town had the reputation of being rich, an\r\norder was immediately sent that every person in it should turn Roman\r\ncatholics: if this was not directly complied with, the town was\r\ninstantly plundered, and the inhabitants murdered; and if it was\r\ncomplied with, a pretence was soon after made to strip the inhabitants\r\nof their wealth.\r\n\r\nOne of the Spanish governors seized upon a very worthy and amiable\r\nIndian prince, and in order to extort from him where his treasures were\r\nconcealed, caused his feet to be burnt till the marrow dropped from his\r\nbones, and he expired through the extremity of the torments he\r\nunderwent.\r\n\r\nIn the interval, between the years 1514 and 1522, the governor of Terra\r\nFirma put to death, and destroyed, 800,000 of the inhabitants of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1523 and 1533, five hundred thousand natives of\r\nNicaragua were transported to Peru, where they all perished by incessant\r\nlabour in the mines.\r\n\r\nIn the space of twelve years, from the first landing of Cortez on the\r\ncontinent of America, to the entire reduction of the populous empire of\r\nMexico, the amazing number of 4,000,000 of Mexicans perished, through\r\nthe unparalleled barbarity of the Spaniards. To come to particulars, the\r\ncity of Cholula, consisted of 30,000 houses, by which its great\r\npopulation may be imagined. The Spaniards seized on all the inhabitants,\r\nwho refusing to turn Roman catholics, as they did not know the meaning\r\nof the religion they were ordered to embrace, the Spaniards put them all\r\nto death, cutting to pieces the lower sort of people, and burning those\r\nof distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE PERSECUTIONS IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND PRIOR TO THE\r\nREIGN OF QUEEN MARY I.\r\n\r\n\r\nGildas, the most ancient British writer extant, who lived about the time\r\nthat the Saxons left the island of Great Britain, has drawn a most\r\nshocking instance of the barbarity of those people.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons, on their arrival, being heathens like the Scots and Picts,\r\ndestroyed the churches and murdered the clergy wherever they came: but\r\nthey could not destroy christianity, for those who would not submit to\r\nthe Saxon yoke, went and resided beyond the Severn. Neither have we the\r\nnames of those christian sufferers transmitted to us, especially those\r\nof the clergy.\r\n\r\nThe most dreadful instance of barbarity under the Saxon government, was\r\nthe massacre of the monks of Bangor, A. D. 586. These monks were in all\r\nrespects different from those men who bear the same name at present.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth century, the Danes, a roving crew of barbarians, landed in\r\ndifferent parts of Britain, both in England and Scotland.\r\n\r\nAt first they were repulsed, but in A. D. 857, a party of them landed\r\nsomewhere near Southampton, and not only robbed the people, but burnt\r\ndown the churches, and murdered the clergy.\r\n\r\nIn A. D. 868, these barbarians penetrated into the centre of England,\r\nand took up their quarters at Nottingham; but the English, under their\r\nking Ethelfrid, drove them from their posts, and obliged them to retire\r\nto Northumberland.\r\n\r\nIn 870, another body of these barbarians landed at Norfolk, and engaged\r\nin battle with the English at Hertford. Victory declared in favour of\r\nthe pagans, who took Edmund, king of the East Angles, prisoner, and\r\nafter treating him with a thousand indignities, transfixed his body with\r\narrows, and then beheaded him.\r\n\r\nIn Fifeshire, in Scotland, they burnt many of the churches, and among\r\nthe rest that belonging to the Culdees, at St. Andrews. The piety of\r\nthese men made them objects of abhorrence to the Danes, who, wherever\r\nthey went singled out the christian priests for destruction, of whom no\r\nless than 200 were massacred in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIt was much the same in that part of Ireland now called Leinster, there\r\nthe Danes murdered and burnt the priests alive in their own churches;\r\nthey carried destruction along with them wherever they went, sparing\r\nneither age nor sex, but the clergy were the most obnoxious to them,\r\nbecause they ridiculed their idolatry, and persuaded their people to\r\nhave nothing to do with them.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward III. the church of England was extremely\r\ncorrupted with errors and superstition; and the light of the gospel of\r\nChrist was greatly eclipsed and darkened with human inventions,\r\nburthensome ceremonies, and gross idolatry.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Wickliffe, then called Lollards, were become extremely\r\nnumerous, and the clergy were so vexed to see them increase whatever\r\npower or influence they might have to molest them in an underhand\r\nmanner, they had no authority by law to put them to death. However, the\r\nclergy embraced the favourable opportunity, and prevailed upon the king\r\nto suffer a bill to be brought into parliament, by which all Lollards\r\nwho remained obstinate, should be delivered over to the secular power,\r\nand burnt as heretics. This act was the first in Britain for the burning\r\nof people for their religious sentiments; it passed in the year 1401,\r\nand was soon after put into execution.\r\n\r\nThe first person who suffered in consequence of this cruel act was\r\nWilliam Santree, or Sawtree, a priest, who was burnt to death in\r\nSmithfield.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, lord Cobham, in consequence of his attachment to the\r\ndoctrines of Wickliffe, was accused of heresy, and being condemned to be\r\nhanged and burnt, was accordingly executed in Loncoln's-Inn Fields, A.\r\nD. 1419.\r\n\r\nThe next man who suffered under this bloody statute was Thomas Bradley,\r\na tailor, and a layman; and a letter having been tendered him, which he\r\nrefused, he was declared an obstinate heretic, and tied to the stake in\r\nSmithfield; where he was burnt alive, rejoicing in the Lord his God.\r\n\r\nThe next person we read of who was tried upon this abominable statute,\r\nwas William Thorpe, a man of some knowledge, who adhered to all the\r\ndoctrines taught by Wickliffe. He was brought many times before\r\narchbishop Arundel, and at last committed a close prisoner, where he\r\ndied, but in what manner cannot now be ascertained.\r\n\r\nAbout this time 36 persons, denominated Lollards, suffered death in St.\r\nGiles', for no other reason than professing their attachment to the\r\ndoctrines of Wickliffe. They were hung on gibbets, and fagots being\r\nplaced under them, as soon as they were suspended, fire was set to them,\r\nso that they were burnt while hanging. Only one of their names has been\r\ntransmitted to us, which is that of Sir Roger Archer whom they\r\ndistinguished from the rest by stripping him stark naked, and executing\r\nhim in that indecent manner.\r\n\r\nMuch about the same time one Richard Turning was burnt alive in\r\nSmithfield, and suffered with all that constancy, fortitude, and\r\nresignation, which have so much distinguished the primitive christians.\r\n\r\nIn 1428, Abraham, a monk of Colchester, Milburn White, a priest and John\r\nWade, a priest, were all three apprehended on a charge of heresy.\r\n\r\nSoon after, father Abraham suffered at Colchester, and with him John\r\nWhaddon; both of whom died in a constant adherence to the truth of the\r\ngospel. Milburn White and John Wade suffered also about the same time in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1431, Richard Ilvedon, a wool-comber, and a citizen of\r\nLondon, was brought before the archbishop, and being declared an\r\nobstinate heretic, was burnt alive on Tower-hill, for no other reason\r\nthan that he embraced and professed the doctrines of Wickliffe.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1431, Thomas Bagley, a priest, who had a living near Malden,\r\nin Essex, was brought before the bishop of London, and being declared an\r\nobstinate heretic, was condemned and burnt alive in Smithfield.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1430, Richard Wick, a priest, was burnt alive on Tower-hill,\r\nfor preaching the doctrines of Wickliffe.\r\n\r\nIn 1440, some of the greatest persons in the kingdom were condemned to\r\nperpetual imprisonment for heresy, as being Lollards;--among whom was\r\nthe dutchess of Gloucester, who had long been a follower of Wickliffe.\r\nIt was otherwise, however, with Roger Only, a priest, who being\r\ncondemned as an obstinate heretic, was burnt alive in Smithfield.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1473, one Thomas Granter was apprehended to London; he was\r\naccused of professing the doctrines of Wickliffe, for which he was\r\ncondemned as an obstinate heretic. This pious man being brought to the\r\nsheriff's house, on the morning of the day appointed for his execution,\r\ndesired a little refreshment, and having ate some, he said to the people\r\npresent, \"I eat now a very good meal, for I have a strange conflict to\r\nengage with before I go to supper;\" and having eaten, he returned thanks\r\nto God for the bounties of his all-gracious providence, requesting that\r\nhe might be instantly led to the place of execution, to bear testimony\r\nto the truth of those principles which he had professed. Accordingly he\r\nwas chained to a stake on Tower-hill, where he was burnt alive,\r\nprofessing the truth with his last breath.\r\n\r\nApril 28th, 1494, Joan Boughton, a lady of considerable rank, was burnt\r\nin Smithfield for professing the doctrines of Wickliffe. This lady was a\r\nwidow, and no less than 80 years of age.\r\n\r\nIn 1498, the king being then at Canterbury, a priest was brought before\r\nhim, accused of heresy, who was immediately ordered to be burnt alive.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1499, one Badram, a pious man, was brought before the bishop\r\nof Norwich, having been accused by some of the priests, with holding the\r\ndoctrines of Wickliffe. He confessed he did believe every thing that was\r\nobjected against him. For this, he was condemned as an obstinate\r\nheretic, and a warrant was granted for his execution; accordingly he was\r\nbrought to the stake at Norwich, where he suffered with great constancy.\r\n\r\nIn 1506, one William Tilfrey, a pious man, was burnt alive at Amersham,\r\nin a close called Stoneyprat, and at the same time, his daughter, Joan\r\nClarke, a married woman, was obliged to light the fagots that were to\r\nburn her father.\r\n\r\nThis year also one father Roberts, a priest, was convicted of being a\r\nLollard before the bishop of Lincoln, and burnt alive at Buckingham.\r\n\r\nIn 1507, one Thomas Norris was burnt alive for the testimony of the\r\ntruth of the gospel, at Norwich. This man was a poor, inoffensive,\r\nharmless person, but his parish priest conversing with him one day\r\nconjectured he was a Lollard. In consequence of this supposition he gave\r\ninformation to the bishop, and Norris was apprehended.\r\n\r\nIn 1508, one Lawrence Guale, who had been kept in prison two years, was\r\nburnt alive at Salisbury, for denying the real presence in the\r\nsacrament. It appeared, that this man kept a shop in Salisbury and\r\nentertained some Lollards in his house; for which he was informed\r\nagainst to the bishop; but he abode by his first testimony, and was\r\ncondemned to suffer as a heretic.\r\n\r\nA pious woman was burnt at Chippen Sudburne, by order of the chancellor,\r\nDr. Whittenham. After she had been consumed in the flames, and the\r\npeople were returning home, a bull broke loose from a butcher and\r\nsingling out the chancellor from all the rest of the company, he gored\r\nhim through the body, and on his horns carried his entrails. This was\r\nseen by all the people, and it is remarkable, that the animal did not\r\nmeddle with any other person whatever.\r\n\r\nOctober 18, 1511, William Succling and John Bannister, who had formerly\r\nrecanted, returned again to the profession of the faith, and were burnt\r\nalive in Smithfield.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1517, one John Brown, (who had recanted before in the reign\r\nof Henry VII. and borne a fagot round St. Paul's,) was condemned by Dr.\r\nWonhaman, archbishop of Canterbury, and burnt alive at Ashford. Before\r\nhe was chained to the stake, the archbishop Wonhaman, and Yester, bishop\r\nof Rochester, caused his feet to be burnt in a fire till all the flesh\r\ncame off, even to the bones. This was done in order to make him again\r\nrecant, but he persisted in his attachment to the truth to the last.\r\n\r\nMuch about this time one Richard Hunn, a merchant tailor of the city of\r\nLondon, was apprehended, having refused to pay the priest his fees for\r\nthe funeral of a child; and being conveyed to the Lollards' Tower, in\r\nthe palace of Lambeth, was there privately murdered by some of the\r\nservants of the archbishop.\r\n\r\nSeptember 24, 1518, John Stilincen, who had before recanted, was\r\napprehended, brought before Richard Fitz-James, bishop of London, and on\r\nthe 25th of October was condemned as a heretic. He was chained to the\r\nstake in Smithfield amidst a vast crowd of spectators, and sealed his\r\ntestimony to the truth with his blood. He declared that he was a\r\nLollard, and that he had always believed the opinions of Wickliffe; and\r\nalthough he had been weak enough to recant his opinions, yet he was now\r\nwilling to convince the world that he was ready to die for the truth.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1519, Thomas Mann was burnt in London, as was one Robert\r\nCelin, a plain honest man for speaking against image worship and\r\npilgrimages.\r\n\r\nMuch about this time, was executed in Smithfield, in London, James\r\nBrewster, a native of Colchester. His sentiments were the same as the\r\nrest of the Lollards, or those who followed the doctrines of Wickliffe;\r\nbut notwithstanding the innocence of his life, and the regularity of his\r\nmanners, he was obliged to submit to papal revenge.\r\n\r\nDuring this year, one Christopher, a shoemaker, was burnt alive at\r\nNewbury, in Berkshire, for denying those popish articles which we have\r\nalready mentioned. This man had got some books in English, which were\r\nsufficient to render him obnoxious to the Romish clergy.\r\n\r\nIn 1521, Thomas Bernard was burnt alive at Norwich, for denying the real\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the year 1522, Mr. Wrigsham, a glover; Mr\r\nLangdale, a hosier; Thomas Bond, Robert Harchets, and William Archer,\r\nshoemaker, with Mrs. Smith, a widow, were apprehended on Ash Wednesday\r\nand committed to prison. After examination, the bishop of Litchfield\r\ndeclared them to be heretics, and they were all condemned and burnt\r\nalive at Coventry.\r\n\r\nRobert Silks, who had been condemned in the bishop's court as a heretic,\r\nmade his escape out of prison, but was taken two years afterward, and\r\nbrought back to Coventry, where he was burnt alive.--The sheriffs always\r\nseized the goods of the martyrs for their own use, so that their wives\r\nand children were left to starve.\r\n\r\nIn 1532, Thomas Harding, who with his wife, had been accused of heresy,\r\nwas brought before the bishop of Lincoln, and condemned for denying the\r\nreal presence in the sacrament. He was then chained to a stake, erected\r\nfor the purpose, at Chesham in the Pell, near Botely; and when they had\r\nset fire to the fagots, one of the spectators dashed out his brains with\r\na billet. The priests told the people, that whoever brought fagots to\r\nburn heretics would have an indulgence to commit sins for forty days.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter end of this year, Worham, archbishop of Canterbury,\r\napprehended one Hitten, a priest at Maidstone; and after he had been\r\nlong tortured in prison, and several times examined by the archbishop,\r\nand Fisher, bishop of Rochester, he was condemned as a heretic, and\r\nburnt alive before the door of his own parish church.\r\n\r\nThomas Bilney, professor of civil law at Cambridge, was brought before\r\nthe bishop of London, and several other bishops, in the Chapter house,\r\nWestminster, and being several times threatened with the stake and\r\nflames, he was weak enough to recant; but he repented severely\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nFor this he was brought before the bishop a second time, and condemned\r\nto death. Before he went to the stake he confessed his adherence to\r\nthose opinions which Luther held; and, when at it, he smiled, and said,\r\n\"I have had many storms in this world, but now my vessel will soon be on\r\nshore in heaven.\" He stood unmoved in the flames, crying out, \"Jesus, I\r\nbelieve;\" and these were the last words he was heard to utter.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after Bilney had suffered, Richard Byfield was cast into\r\nprison, and endured some whipping, for his adherence to the doctrines of\r\nLuther: this Mr. Byfield had been some time a monk, at Barnes, in Surry,\r\nbut was converted by reading Tindal's version of the New Testament. The\r\nsufferings this man underwent for the truth were so great, that it would\r\nrequire a volume to contain them. Sometimes he was shut up in a dungeon,\r\nwhere he was almost suffocated, by the offensive and horrid smell of\r\nfilth and stagnated water. At other times he was tied up by the arms,\r\ntill almost all his joints were dislocated. He was whipped at the post\r\nseveral times, till scarce any flesh was left on his back; and all this\r\nwas done to make him recant. He was then taken to the Lollard's Tower in\r\nLambeth palace, where he was chained by the neck to the wall, and once\r\nevery day beaten in the most cruel manner by the archbishop's servants.\r\nAt last he was condemned, degraded, and burnt in Smithfield.\r\n\r\nThe next person that suffered was John Tewkesbury. This was a plain\r\nsimple man, who had been guilty of no other offence against what was\r\ncalled the holy mother church, than that of reading Tindal's translation\r\nof the New Testament. At first he was weak enough to abjure, but\r\nafterwards repented, and acknowledged the truth. For this he was brought\r\nbefore the bishop of London, who condemned him as an obstinate heretic.\r\nHe suffered greatly during the time of his imprisonment, so that when\r\nthey brought him out to execution he was almost dead. He was conducted\r\nto the stake in Smithfield, where he was burned, declaring his utter\r\nabhorrence of popery, and professing a firm belief that his cause was\r\njust in the sight of God.\r\n\r\nMuch about this time Valentine Treest, and his wife, were apprehended in\r\nYorkshire, and having been examined by the archbishop, were deemed as\r\nobstinate heretics, and burnt.\r\n\r\nThe next person that suffered in this reign, was James Baynham, a\r\nreputable citizen in London, who had married the widow of a gentleman in\r\nthe Temple. When chained to the stake he embraced the fagots, and said\r\n\"Oh, ye papists, behold! ye look for miracles; here now may you see a\r\nmiracle; for in this fire I feel no more pain than if I were in bed; for\r\nit is as sweet to me as a bed of roses.\" Thus he resigned his soul into\r\nthe hands of his Redeemer.\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of this martyr, one Traxnal, an inoffensive\r\ncountryman, was burned alive at Bradford in Wiltshire, because he would\r\nnot acknowledge the real presence in the sacrament, nor own the papal\r\nsupremacy over the consciences of men.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1533, John Frith, a noted martyr, died for the truth. When\r\nbrought to the stake in Smithfield, he embraced the fagots, and exhorted\r\na young man named Andrew Hewit, who suffered with him, to trust his soul\r\nto that God who had redeemed it. Both these sufferers endured much\r\ntorment, for the wind blew the flames away from them, so that they were\r\nabove two hours in agony before they expired.\r\n\r\nAt the latter end of this year, Mr. Thomas Bennet, a school-master, was\r\napprehended at Exeter, and being brought before the bishop, refused to\r\nrecant his opinions, for which he was delivered over to the secular\r\npower, and burned alive near that city.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1538, one Collins, a madman, suffered death with his dog in\r\nSmithfield. The circumstances were as follow: Collins happened to be in\r\nchurch when the priest elevated the host; and Collins, in derision of\r\nthe sacrifice of the Mass, lifted up his dog above his head. For this\r\ncrime Collins, who ought to have been sent to a madhouse, or whipped at\r\nthe cart's tail, was brought before the bishop of London; and although\r\nhe was really mad, yet such was the force of popish power, such the\r\ncorruption in church and state, that the poor madman, and his dog, were\r\nboth carried to the stake in Smithfield, where they were burned to\r\nashes, amidst a vast crowd of spectators.\r\n\r\nThere were some other persons who suffered the same year, of whom we\r\nshall take notice in the order they lie before us.\r\n\r\nOne Cowbridge suffered at Oxford; and although he was reputed to be a\r\nmadman, yet he showed great signs of piety when he was fastened to the\r\nstake, and after the flames were kindled around him.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time one Purderve was put to death, for saying privately\r\nto a priest, after he had drunk the wine, \"He blessed the hungry people\r\nwith the empty chalice.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time was condemned William Letton, a monk of great age, in\r\nthe county of Suffolk, who was burned at Norwich for speaking against an\r\nidol that was carried in procession; and for asserting, that the\r\nsacrament should be administered in both kinds.\r\n\r\nSome time before the burning of these men, Nicholas Peke was executed at\r\nNorwich; and when the fire was lighted, he was so scorched that he was\r\nas black as pitch. Dr. Reading standing before him, with Dr. Hearne and\r\nDr. Spragwell, having a long white wand in his hand, struck him upon the\r\nright shoulder, and said, \"Peke, recant, and believe in the Sacrament.\"\r\nTo this he answered, \"I despise thee and it also;\" and with great\r\nviolence he spit blood, occasioned by the anguish of his sufferings. Dr.\r\nReading granted forty days indulgence for the sufferer, in order that he\r\nmight recant his opinions. But he persisted in his adherence to the\r\ntruth, without paying any regard to the malice of his enemies; and he\r\nwas burned alive, rejoicing that Christ had counted him worthy to\r\nsuffer for his name's sake.\r\n\r\nOn July 28, 1540, or 1541, (for the chronology differs) Thomas Cromwell,\r\nearl of Essex, was brought to a scaffold on Tower-hill, where he was\r\nexecuted with some striking instances of cruelty. He made a short speech\r\nto the people, and then meekly resigned himself to the axe.\r\n\r\nIt is, we think, with great propriety, that this nobleman is ranked\r\namong the martyrs; for although the accusations preferred against him\r\ndid not relate to any thing in religion, yet had it not been for his\r\nzeal to demolish popery, he might have to the last retained the king's\r\nfavour. To this may be added, that the papists plotted his destruction,\r\nfor he did more towards promoting the reformation, than any man in that\r\nage, except the good Dr. Cranmer.\r\n\r\nSoon after the execution of Cromwell, Dr. Cuthbert Barnes, Thomas\r\nGarnet, and William Jerome, were brought before the ecclesiastical court\r\nof the bishop of London, and accused of heresy.\r\n\r\nBeing before the bishop of London, Dr. Barnes was asked whether the\r\nsaints prayed for us? To this he answered, that he would leave that to\r\nGod; but (said he) I will pray for you.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of July, 1541, these men were brought from the Tower to\r\nSmithfield, where they were all chained to one stake; and there suffered\r\ndeath with a constancy that nothing less than a firm faith in Jesus\r\nChrist could inspire.\r\n\r\nOne Thomas Sommers, an honest merchant, with three others, was thrown\r\ninto prison, for reading some of Luther's books; and they were condemned\r\nto carry those books to a fire in Cheapside; there they were to throw\r\nthem in the flames; but Sommers threw his over, for which he was sent\r\nback to the Tower, where he was stoned to death.\r\n\r\nDreadful persecutions were at this time carried on at Lincoln, under Dr.\r\nLongland, the bishop of that diocess. At Buckingham, Thomas Bainard, and\r\nJames Moreton, the one for reading the Lord's prayer in English, and the\r\nother for reading St. James' epistles in English, were both condemned\r\nand burnt alive.\r\n\r\nAnthony Parsons, a priest, together with two others, were sent to\r\nWindsor, to be examined concerning heresy; and several articles were\r\ntendered to them to subscribe, which they refused. This was carried on\r\nby the bishop of Salisbury, who was the most violent persecutor of any\r\nin that age, except Bonner. When they were brought to the stake, Parsons\r\nasked for some drink, which being brought him, he drank to his\r\nfellow-sufferers, saying, \"Be merry, my brethren, and lift up your\r\nhearts to God; for after this sharp breakfast I trust we shall have a\r\ngood dinner in the kingdom of Christ, our Lord and Redeemer.\" At these\r\nwords Eastwood, one of the sufferers, lifted up his eyes and hands to\r\nheaven, desiring the Lord above to receive his spirit. Parsons pulled\r\nthe straw near to him, and then said to the spectators, This is God's\r\narmour, and now I am a christian soldier prepared for battle: I look for\r\nno mercy but through the merits of Christ; he is my only Saviour, in him\r\ndo I trust for salvation; and soon after the fires were lighted, which\r\nburned their bodies, but could not hurt their precious and immortal\r\nsouls. Their constancy triumphed over cruelty, and their sufferings will\r\nbe held in everlasting remembrance.\r\n\r\nIn 1546, one Saitees, a priest, was, by order of bishop Gardiner, hanged\r\nin Southwark, without a council process; and all that was alleged\r\nagainst him was, that of reading Tindal's New Testament.\r\n\r\nThis year one Kirby was burned in Ipswich, for the testimony of the\r\ntruth, for denying the real presence in the sacrament. When this martyr\r\nwas brought to the stake, he said to one Mr. Wingfield, who attended\r\nhim, \"Ah! Mr. Wingfield, be at my death, and you shall say, there\r\nstandeth a christian sufferer in the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE PERSECUTION IN SCOTLAND DURING THE REIGN OF KING HENRY\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first person we meet with who suffered in Scotland on the score of\r\nreligion, was one Patrick Hamilton, a gentleman of an independent\r\nfortune, and descended from a very ancient and honourable family.\r\n\r\nHaving acquired a liberal education, and being desirous of farther\r\nimproving himself in useful knowledge, he left Scotland, and went to the\r\nuniversity of Wirtemberg, in Germany, in order to finish his studies.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence here, he became intimately acquainted with those\r\neminent lights of the gospel, Martin Luther and Philip Melancthon; from\r\nwhose writings and doctrines he strongly attached himself to the\r\nprotestant religion.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop of St. Andrews (who was a rigid papist) hearing of Mr.\r\nHamilton's proceedings, caused him to be seized, and being brought\r\nbefore him, after a short examination relative to his religious\r\nprinciples, he committed him a prisoner to the castle, at the same time\r\nordering him to be confined in the most loathsome part of the prison.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mr. Hamilton was brought before the bishop, and several\r\nothers, for examination, when the principal articles exhibited against\r\nhim were, his publicly disapproving of pilgrimages, purgatory, prayers\r\nto saints, for the dead, &c.\r\n\r\nThese articles Mr. Hamilton acknowledged to be true, in consequence of\r\nwhich he was immediately condemned to be burnt; and that his\r\ncondemnation might have the greater authority, they caused it to be\r\nsubscribed by all those of any note who were present, and to make the\r\nnumber as considerable as possible, even admitted the subscription of\r\nboys who were sons of the nobility.\r\n\r\nSo anxious was this bigoted and persecuting prelate for the destruction\r\nof Mr. Hamilton, that he ordered his sentence to be put in execution on\r\nthe afternoon of the very day it was pronounced. He was accordingly led\r\nto the place appointed for the horrid tragedy, and was attended by a\r\nprodigious number of spectators. The greatest part of the multitude\r\nwould not believe it was intended he should be put to death, but that it\r\nwas only done to frighten him, and thereby bring him over to embrace the\r\nprinciples of the Romish religion. But they soon found themselves\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the stake, he kneeled down, and, for some time,\r\nprayed with great fervency. After this he was fastened to the stake, and\r\nthe fagots placed round him. A quantity of gunpowder having been placed\r\nunder his arms was first set on fire which scorched his left hand and\r\none side of his face, but did no material injury, neither did it\r\ncommunicate with the fagots. In consequence of this, more powder and\r\ncombustible matter were brought, which being set on fire took effect,\r\nand the fagots being kindled, he called out, with an audible voice,\r\n\"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit! How long shall darkness overwhelm this\r\nrealm? And how long wilt thou suffer the tyranny of these men?\"\r\n\r\nThe fire burning slow put him to great torment; but he bore it with\r\nchristian magnanimity. What gave him the greatest pain was, the clamour\r\nof some wicked men set on by the friars, who frequently cried, \"Turn,\r\nthou heretic; call upon our lady; say, Salve Regina, &c.\" To whom he\r\nreplied, \"Depart from me, and trouble me not, ye messengers of Satan.\"\r\nOne Campbell, a friar, who was the ringleader, still continuing to\r\ninterrupt him by opprobrious language; he said to him, \"Wicked man, God\r\nforgive thee.\" After which, being prevented from farther speech by the\r\nviolence of the smoke, and the rapidity of the flames, he resigned up\r\nhis soul into the hands of Him who gave it.\r\n\r\nThis steadfast believer in Christ suffered martyrdom in the year 1527.\r\n\r\nOne Henry Forest, a young inoffensive Benedictine, being charged with\r\nspeaking respectfully of the above Patrick Hamilton, was thrown into\r\nprison; and, in confessing himself to a friar, owned that he thought\r\nHamilton a good man; and that the articles for which he was sentenced to\r\ndie, might be defended. This being revealed by the friar, it was\r\nreceived as evidence; and the poor Benedictine was sentenced to be\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\nWhilst consultation was held, with regard to the manner of his\r\nexecution, John Lindsay, one of the archbishop's gentlemen, offered his\r\nadvice, to burn friar Forest in some cellar; for, said be, the smoke of\r\nPatrick Hamilton hath infected all those on whom it blew.\r\n\r\nThis advice was taken, and the poor victim was rather suffocated than\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\nThe next who fell victims for professing the truth of the gospel, were\r\nDavid Stratton and Norman Gourlay.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the fatal spot, they both kneeled down, and prayed\r\nfor some time with great fervency. They then arose, when Stratton,\r\naddressing himself to the spectators, exhorted them to lay aside their\r\nsuperstitious and idolatrous notions, and employ their time in seeking\r\nthe true light of the gospel. He would have said more, but was prevented\r\nby the officers who attended.\r\n\r\nTheir sentence was then put into execution, and they cheerfully resigned\r\nup their souls to that God who gave them, hoping, through the merits of\r\nthe great Redeemer, for a glorious resurrection to life immortal. They\r\nsuffered in the year 1534.\r\n\r\nThe martyrdoms of the two before-mentioned persons, were soon followed\r\nby that of Mr. Thomas Forret, who, for a considerable time, had been\r\ndean of the Romish church; Killor and Beverage, two blacksmiths; Duncan\r\nSimson, a priest; and Robert Forrester, a gentleman. They were all burnt\r\ntogether, on the Castle-hill at Edinburgh, the last day of February,\r\n1538.\r\n\r\nThe year following the martyrdoms of the before-mentioned persons, viz.\r\n1539, two others were apprehended on a suspicion of heresy; namely,\r\nJerom Russel, and Alexander Kennedy, a youth about eighteen years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThese two persons, after being some time confined in prison, were\r\nbrought before the archbishop for examination. In the course of which,\r\nRussel, being a very sensible man, reasoned learnedly against his\r\naccusers; while they in return made use of very opprobrious language.\r\n\r\nThe examination being over, and both of them deemed heretics, the\r\narchbishop pronounced the dreadful sentence of death, and they were\r\nimmediately delivered over to the secular power in order for execution.\r\n\r\nThe next day they were led to the place appointed for them to suffer; in\r\ntheir way to which, Russel, seeing his fellow-sufferer have the\r\nappearance of timidity in his countenance, thus addressed him: \"Brother,\r\nfear not; greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world. The\r\npain that we are to suffer is short, and shall be light; but our joy and\r\nconsolation shall never have an end. Let us, therefore, strive to enter\r\ninto our Master and Saviour's joy, by the same straight way which he\r\nhath taken before us. Death cannot hurt us, for it is already destroyed\r\nby Him, for whose sake we are now going to suffer.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the fatal spot, they both kneeled down and prayed\r\nfor some time; after which being fastened to the stake, and the fagots\r\nlighted, they cheerfully resigned their souls into the hands of Him who\r\ngave them, in full hopes of an everlasting reward in the heavenly\r\nmansions.\r\n\r\nIn 1543, the archbishop of St. Andrews made a visitation into various\r\nparts of his diocese, where several persons were informed against at\r\nPerth for heresy. Among these the following were condemned to die, viz.\r\nWilliam Anderson, Robert Lamb, James Finlayson, James Hunter, James\r\nRaveleson, and Helen Stark.\r\n\r\nThe accusations laid against these respective persons were as follow:\r\n\r\nThe four first were accused of having hung up the image of St. Francis,\r\nnailing ram's horns on his head, and fastening a cow's tail to his rump;\r\nbut the principal matter on which they were condemned was, having\r\nregaled themselves with a goose on fast day.\r\n\r\nJames Raveleson was accused of having ornamented his house with the\r\nthree crowned diadem of Peter, carved in wood, which the archbishop\r\nconceived to be done in mockery to his cardinal's cap.\r\n\r\nHelen Stark was accused of not having accustomed herself to pray to the\r\nVirgin Mary, more especially during the time she was in child bed.\r\n\r\nOn these respective accusations they were all found guilty, and\r\nimmediately received sentence of death; the four men for eating the\r\ngoose to be hanged; James Raveleson to be burnt; and the woman, with her\r\nsucking infant, to be put into a sack and drowned.\r\n\r\nThe four men, with the woman and child, suffered at the same time, but\r\nJames Raveleson was not executed till some days after.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-mentioned persons, many others were cruelly\r\npersecuted, some being banished, and others confined in loathsome\r\ndungeons. Among whom were Mr. John Knox, the celebrated Scottish\r\nreformist; and John Rogers, a pious and learned man, who was murdered in\r\nprison, and his body thrown over the walls into the street; after which\r\na report was spread, that he had met with his death in attempting to\r\nmake his escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Account of the Life, Sufferings, and death of Mr. George Wishart,\r\nwho was strangled and afterward burned, in Scotland, for professing the\r\nTruth of the Gospel._\r\n\r\nMr. George Wishart was born in Scotland, and after receiving a\r\ngrammatical education at a private school, he left that place, and\r\nfinished his studies at the university of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve himself as much as possible in the knowledge of\r\nliterature, he travelled into various parts abroad, where he\r\ndistinguished himself for his great learning and abilities, both in\r\nphilosophy and divinity.\r\n\r\nAfter being some time abroad he returned to England, and took up his\r\nresidence at Cambridge, where he was admitted a member of Bennet\r\ncollege. Having taken up his degrees, he entered into holy orders, and\r\nexpounded the gospel in so clear and intelligible a manner, as highly to\r\ndelight his numerous auditors.\r\n\r\nBeing desirous of propagating the true gospel in his own country he left\r\nCambridge in 1544, and on his arrival in Scotland he first preached at\r\nMontrose, and afterwards at Dundee. In this last place he made a public\r\nexposition of the epistle to the Romans, which he went through with such\r\ngrace and freedom, as greatly alarmed the papists.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, (at the instigation of cardinal Beaton, the\r\narchbishop of St. Andrews) one Robert Miln, a principal man at Dundee,\r\nwent to the church where Wishart preached, and in the middle of his\r\ndiscourse publicly told him not to trouble the town any more, for he was\r\ndetermined not to suffer it.\r\n\r\nThis sudden rebuff greatly surprised Wishart, who, after a short pause,\r\nlooking sorrowfully on the speaker and the audience, said, \"God is my\r\nwitness, that I never minded your trouble but your comfort; yea, your\r\ntrouble is more grievous to me than it is to yourselves: but I am\r\nassured, to refuse God's word, and to chase from you his messenger,\r\nshall not preserve you from trouble, but shall bring you into it: for\r\nGod shall send you ministers that shall fear neither burning nor\r\nbanishment. I have offered you the word of salvation. With the hazard of\r\nmy life, I have remained among you; now you yourselves refuse me; and I\r\nmust leave my innocence to be declared by my God. If it be long\r\nprosperous with you, I am not led by the spirit of truth: but if\r\nunlooked-for trouble come upon you, acknowledge the cause and turn to\r\nGod, who is gracious and merciful. But if you turn not at the first\r\nwarning, he will visit you with fire and sword.\" At the close of this\r\nspeech he left the pulpit, and retired.\r\n\r\nAfter this he went into the west of Scotland, where he preached God's\r\nword, which was gladly received by many.\r\n\r\nA short time after this, Mr. Wishart received intelligence, that the\r\nplague was broke out in Dundee. It began four days after he was\r\nprohibited from preaching there, and raged so extremely, that it was\r\nalmost beyond credit how many died in the space of twenty-four hours.\r\nThis being related to him, he, notwithstanding the importunity of his\r\nfriends to detain him, determined to go there, saying, \"They are now in\r\ntroubles, and need comfort. Perhaps this hand of God will make them now\r\nto magnify and reverence the word of God, which before they lightly\r\nesteemed.\"\r\n\r\nHere he was with joy received by the godly. He chose the eastgate for\r\nthe place of his preaching; so that the healthy were within, and the\r\nsick without the gate. He took his text from these words, He sent his\r\nword and healed them, &c. In this sermon he chiefly dwelt upon the\r\nadvantage and comfort of God's word, the judgments that ensue upon the\r\ncontempt or rejection of it, the freedom of God's grace to all his\r\npeople, and the happiness of those of his elect, whom he takes to\r\nhimself out of this miserable world. The hearts of his hearers were so\r\nraised by the divine force of this discourse, as not to regard death,\r\nbut to judge them the more happy who should then be called, not knowing\r\nwhether he should have such comfort again with them.\r\n\r\nAfter this the plague abated; though, in the midst of it, Wishart\r\nconstantly visited those that lay in the greatest extremity, and\r\ncomforted them by his exhortations.\r\n\r\nWhen he took his leave of the people of Dundee, he said, \"That God had\r\nalmost put an end to that plague, and that he was now called to another\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nHe went from thence to Montrose; where he sometimes preached, but spent\r\nmost of his time in private meditation and prayer.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that before he left Dundee, and while he was engaged in the\r\nlabours of love to the bodies, as well as to the souls, of those poor\r\nafflicted people, cardinal Beaton engaged a desperate popish priest,\r\ncalled John Weighton, to kill him; the attempt to execute which was as\r\nfollows: one day, after Wishart had finished his sermon, and the people\r\ndeparted, a priest stood waiting at the bottom of the stairs, with a\r\nnaked dagger in his hand under his gown.--But Mr. Wishart having a\r\nsharp, piercing eye, and seeing the priest as he came from the pulpit,\r\nsaid to him, \"My friend, what would you have?\" and immediately clapping\r\nhis hand upon the dagger, took it from him. The priest being terrified,\r\nfell on his knees, confessed his intention, and craved pardon. A noise\r\nbeing hereupon raised, and it coming to the ears of those who were sick,\r\nthey cried, \"Deliver the traitor to us, we will take him by force;\" and\r\nthey burst in at the gate. But Wishart, taking the priest in his arms,\r\nsaid, \"Whatsoever hurts him shall hurt me; for he hath done me no\r\nmischief, but much good, by teaching more heedfulness for the time to\r\ncome.\" By this conduct he appeased the people and saved the life of the\r\nwicked priest.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return to Montrose, the cardinal again conspired his\r\ndeath, causing a letter to be sent to him as if it had been from his\r\nfamiliar friend, the Laird of Kennier, in which he was desired with all\r\npossible speed to come to him, as he was taken with a sudden sickness.\r\nIn the mean time the cardinal had provided sixty men armed to lie in\r\nwait within a mile and a half of Montrose, in order to murder him as he\r\npassed that way.\r\n\r\nThe letter coming to Wishart's hand by a boy, who also brought him a\r\nhorse for the journey. Wishart, accompanied by some honest men, his\r\nfriends, set forward; but something particular striking his mind by the\r\nway, he returned back, which they wondering at, asked him the cause; to\r\nwhom he said, \"I will not go; I am forbidden of God; I am assured there\r\nis treason. Let some of you go to yonder place, and tell me what you\r\nfind.\" Which doing, they made the discovery; and hastily returning, they\r\ntold Mr. Wishart; whereupon he said, \"I know I shall end my life by that\r\nblood-thirsty man's hands, but it will not be in this manner.\"\r\n\r\nA short time after this he left Montrose, and proceeded to Edinburgh in\r\norder to propagate the gospel in that city. By the way he lodged with a\r\nfaithful brother, called James Watson of Inner-Goury. In the middle of\r\nthe night he got up, and went into the yard, which two men hearing they\r\nprivately followed him.\r\n\r\nWhile in the yard, he fell on his knees, and prayed for some time with\r\nthe greatest fervency, after which he arose, and returned to his bed.\r\nThose who attended him, appearing as though they were ignorant of all,\r\ncame and asked him where he had been? But he would not answer them. The\r\nnext day they importuned him to tell them, saying, \"Be plain with us,\r\nfor we heard your mourning, and saw your gestures.\"\r\n\r\nOn this he, with a dejected countenance, said, \"I had rather you had\r\nbeen in your beds.\" But they still pressing upon him to know something,\r\nhe said, \"I will tell you; I am assured that my warfare is near at an\r\nend, and therefore pray to God with me, that I shrink not when the\r\nbattle waxeth most hot.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after, cardinal Beaton, archbishop of St. Andrews, being informed\r\nthat Mr. Wishart was at the house of Mr. Cockburn, of Ormiston, in East\r\nLothian, he applied to the regent to cause him to be apprehended; with\r\nwhich, after great persuasion, and much against his will, he complied.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this the cardinal immediately proceeded to the trial\r\nof Wishart, against whom no less than eighteen articles were exhibited.\r\nMr. Wishart answered the respective articles with great composure of\r\nmind, and in so learned and clear a manner, as greatly surprised most of\r\nthose who were present.\r\n\r\nAfter the examination was finished, the archbishop endeavoured to\r\nprevail on Mr. Wishart to recant; but he was too firmly fixed in his\r\nreligious principles, and too much enlightened with the truth of the\r\ngospel, to be in the least moved.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of his execution there came to him two friars from the\r\ncardinal; one of whom put on him a black linen coat, and the other\r\nbrought several bags of gunpowder, which they tied about different parts\r\nof his body.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he arrived at the stake, the executioner put a rope round his\r\nneck, and a chain about his middle; upon which he fell on his knees and\r\nthus exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"O thou Saviour of the world, have mercy upon me! Father of heaven, I\r\ncommend my spirit into Thy holy hands.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this he prayed for his accusers, saying, \"I beseech thee, Father\r\nof heaven, forgive them that have, from ignorance or an evil mind,\r\nforged lies of me: I forgive them with all my heart. I beseech Christ to\r\nforgive them, that have ignorantly condemned me.\"\r\n\r\nHe was then fastened to the stake, and the fagots being lighted,\r\nimmediately set fire to the powder that was tied about him, and which\r\nblew into a flame and smoke.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the castle, who stood so near that he was singed with\r\nthe flame, exhorted our martyr, in a few words, to be of good cheer, and\r\nto ask the pardon of God for his offences. To which he replied, \"This\r\nflame occasions trouble to my body, indeed, but it hath in nowise\r\nbroken my spirit. But he who now so proudly looks down upon me from\r\nyonder lofty place (pointing to the cardinal) shall, ere long, be as\r\nignominiously thrown down, as now he proudly lolls at his ease.\" Which\r\nprediction was soon after fulfilled. The executioner then pulled the\r\nrope which was tied about his neck with great violence, so that he was\r\nsoon strangled; and the fire getting strength, burnt with such rapidity\r\nthat in less than an hour his body was totally consumed.\r\n\r\nThe next person who fell a martyr to popish bigotry, was one Adam\r\nWallace, of Winton, in East-Lothian, who having obtained a true\r\nknowledge of the gospel of Christ, spent the greater part of his time in\r\nendeavouring to propagate it among his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nHis conduct being noticed by some bigoted papists, an information was\r\nlaid against him for heresy, on which he was apprehended, and committed\r\nto prison.\r\n\r\nAfter examination, sentence of death was passed upon him as heretic; and\r\nhe was immediately delivered over to the secular power, in order for\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day, Wallace was visited by several Romish\r\npriests, who endeavoured to prevail on him to recant; but he stood so\r\nsteadfast in the faith he professed, and used such forcible arguments in\r\nvindication of the gospel, that they left him with some wrath, saying,\r\n\"He was too abandoned to receive any impression.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning he was conducted to the Castle-hill at Edinburgh, when,\r\nbeing chained to the stake, and the fagots lighted, he cheerfully\r\nresigned up his soul into the hands of him who gave it, in full\r\nassurance of receiving a crown of glory in the heavenly mansions.\r\n\r\nThe last who suffered martyrdom in Scotland, for the cause of Christ,\r\nwas one Walter Mill, who was burnt at Edinburgh in the year 1558.\r\n\r\nThis person, in his younger years, had travelled into Germany, and on\r\nhis return was installed a priest of the church of Lunan in Angus, but,\r\non an information of heresy, in the time of cardinal Beaton, he was\r\nforced to abandon his charge and abscond. But he was soon apprehended,\r\nand committed to prison.\r\n\r\nBeing interrogated by Sir Andrew Oliphant, whether he would recant his\r\nopinions, he answered in the negative, saying, He would sooner forfeit\r\nten thousand lives, than relinquish a particle of those heavenly\r\nprinciples he had received from the suffrages of his blessed Redeemer.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, sentence of condemnation was immediately passed\r\non him, and he was conducted to prison in order for execution the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nThis steadfast believer in Christ was eighty-two years of age, and\r\nexceedingly infirm; from whence it was supposed, that he could scarcely\r\nbe heard. However, when he was taken to the place of execution, he\r\nexpressed his religious sentiments with such courage, and at the same\r\ntime composure of mind, as astonished even his enemies. As soon as he\r\nwas fastened to the stake, and the fagots lighted, he addressed the\r\nspectators as follows:\r\n\r\nThe cause why I suffer this day is not for any crime, (though I\r\nacknowledge myself a miserable sinner) but only for the defence of the\r\ntruth as it is in Jesus Christ; and I praise God who hath called me, by\r\nhis mercy, to seal the truth with my life; which, as I received it from\r\nhim, so I willingly and joyfully offer it up to his glory. Therefore, as\r\nyou would escape eternal death, be no longer seduced by the lies of the\r\nseat of Antichrist: but depend solely on Jesus Christ, and his mercy,\r\nthat you may be delivered from condemnation. And then added, \"That he\r\ntrusted he should be the last who would suffer death in Scotland upon a\r\nreligious account.\"\r\n\r\nThus did this pious christian cheerfully give up his life, in defence of\r\nthe truth of Christ's gospel, not doubting but he should be made a\r\npartaker of his heavenly kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPERSECUTIONS IN ENGLAND DURING THE REIGN OF QUEEN MARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe premature death of that celebrated young monarch, Edward the Sixth,\r\noccasioned the most extraordinary and wonderful occurrences, which had\r\never existed from the times of our blessed Lord and Saviour's\r\nincarnation in human shape. This melancholy event became speedily a\r\nsubject of general regret. The succession to the British throne was soon\r\nmade a matter of contention; and the scenes which ensued were a\r\ndemonstration of the serious affliction which the kingdom was involved\r\nin. As his loss to the nation was more and more unfolded, the\r\nremembrance of his government was more and more the basis of grateful\r\nrecollection. The very awful prospect, which was soon presented to the\r\nfriends of Edward's administration, under the direction of his\r\ncounsellors and servants, was a contemplation which the reflecting mind\r\nwas compelled to regard with most alarming apprehensions. The rapid\r\napproaches which were made towards a total reversion of the proceedings\r\nof the young king's reign, denoted the advances which were thereby\r\nrepresented to an entire revolution in the management of public affairs\r\nboth in church and state.\r\n\r\nAlarmed for the condition in which the kingdom was likely to be involved\r\nby the king's death, an endeavour to prevent the consequences, which\r\nwere but too plainly foreseen, was productive of the most serious and\r\nfatal effects. The king, in his long and lingering affliction, was\r\ninduced to make a will, by which he bequeathed the English crown to lady\r\nJane, the daughter of the duke of Suffolk, who had been married to the\r\nlord Guilford, the son of the duke of Northumberland, and was the\r\ngrand-daughter of the second sister of king Henry, by Charles, duke of\r\nSuffolk. By this will, the succession of Mary and Elizabeth, his two\r\nsisters, was entirely superseded, from an apprehension of the returning\r\nsystem of popery; and the king's council, with the chief of the\r\nnobility, the lord-mayor of the city of London, and almost all the\r\njudges and the principal lawyers of the realm, subscribed their names to\r\nthis regulation, as a sanction to the measure. Lord chief justice Hale,\r\nthough a true protestant and an upright judge, alone declined to unite\r\nhis name in favour of the lady Jane, because he had already signified\r\nhis opinion, that Mary was entitled to assume the reins of government.\r\nOthers objected to Mary's being placed on the throne, on account of\r\ntheir fears that she might marry a foreigner, and thereby bring the\r\ncrown into considerable danger. Her partiality to popery also left\r\nlittle doubt on the minds of any, that she would be induced to revive\r\nthe dormant interests of the pope, and change the religion which had\r\nbeen used both in the days of her father, king Henry, and in those of\r\nher brother Edward: for in all his time she had manifested the greatest\r\nstubbornness and inflexibility of temper, as must be obvious from her\r\nletter to the lords of the council, whereby she put in her claim to the\r\ncrown, on her brother's decease.\r\n\r\nWhen this happened, the nobles, who had associated to prevent Mary's\r\nsuccession, and had been instrumental in promoting, and, perhaps,\r\nadvising the measures of Edward, speedily proceeded to proclaim lady\r\nJane Gray, to be queen of England, in the city of London and various\r\nother populous cities of the realm. Though young, she possessed talents\r\nof a very superior nature, and her improvements under a most excellent\r\ntutor had given her many very great advantages.\r\n\r\nHer reign was of only five days continuance, for Mary, having succeeded\r\nby false promises in obtaining the crown, speedily commenced the\r\nexecution of her avowed intention of extirpating and burning every\r\nprotestant. She was crowned at Westminister in the usual form, and her\r\nelevation was the signal for the commencement of the bloody persecution\r\nwhich followed.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the sword of authority, she was not sparing in its\r\nexercise. The supporters of Lady Jane Gray were destined to feel its\r\nforce. The duke of Northumberland was the first who experienced her\r\nsavage resentment. Within a month after his confinement in the Tower, he\r\nwas condemned, and brought to the scaffold, to suffer as a traitor. From\r\nhis various crimes, resulting out of a sordid and inordinate ambition,\r\nhe died unpitied and unlamented.\r\n\r\nThe changes, which followed with rapidity, unequivocally declared, that\r\nthe queen was disaffected to the present state of religion.--Dr. Poynet\r\nwas displaced to make room for Gardiner to be bishop of Winchester, to\r\nwhom she also gave the important office of lord-chancellor. Dr. Ridley\r\nwas dismissed from the see of London, and Bonne introduced. J. Story\r\nwas put out of the bishopric of Chichester, to admit Dr. Day. J. Hooper\r\nwas sent prisoner to the Fleet, and Dr. Heath put into the see of\r\nWorcester. Miles Coverdale was also excluded from Exeter, and Dr. Vesie\r\nplaced in that diocess. Dr. Tonstall was also promoted to the see of\r\nDurham. \"These things being marked and perceived, great heaviness and\r\ndiscomfort grew more and more to all good men's hearts; but to the\r\nwicked great rejoicing. They that could dissemble took no great care how\r\nthe matter went; but such, whose consciences were joined with the truth,\r\nperceived already coals to be kindled, which after should be the\r\ndestruction of many a true christian.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The words and behaviour of the lady Jane upon the Scaffold._\r\n\r\nThe next victim was the amiable lady Jane Gray, who, by her acceptance\r\nof the crown at the earnest solicitations of her friends, incurred the\r\nimplacable resentment of the bloody Mary. When she first mounted the\r\nscaffold, she spake to the spectators in this manner: Good people, I am\r\ncome hither to die, and by a law I am condemned to the same. The fact\r\nagainst the queen's highness was unlawful, and the consenting thereunto\r\nby me: but, touching the procurement and desire thereof by me, or on my\r\nbehalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocency before God, and the face\r\nof you, good christian people, this day: and therewith she wrung her\r\nhands, wherein she had her book. Then said she, I pray you all, good\r\nchristian people, to bear me witness, that I die a good christian woman,\r\nand that I do look to be saved by no other mean, but only by the mercy\r\nof God in the blood of his only Son Jesus Christ: and I confess, that\r\nwhen I did know the word of God, I neglected the same, loved myself and\r\nthe world, and therefore this plague and punishment is happily and\r\nworthily happened unto me for my sins; and yet I thank God, that of his\r\ngoodness he hath thus given me a time and a respite to repent and now,\r\ngood people, while I am alive, I pray you assist me with your prayers.\r\nAnd then, kneeling down, she turned to Feckenham, saying, Shall I say\r\nthis psalm? and he said, Yea. Then she said the psalm of Miserere mei\r\nDeus, in English, in a most devout manner throughout to the end; and\r\nthen she stood up, and gave her maid, Mrs. Ellen, her gloves and\r\nhandkerchief, and her book to Mr. Bruges; and then she untied her gown,\r\nand the executioner pressed upon her to help her off with it: but she,\r\ndesiring him to let her alone, turned towards her two gentlewomen, who\r\nhelped her off therewith, and also with her frowes, paaft, and\r\nneckerchief, giving to her a fair handkerchief to put about her eyes.\r\n\r\nThen the executioner kneeled down, and asked her forgiveness whom she\r\nforgave most willingly. Then he desired her to stand upon the straw,\r\nwhich doing, she saw the block. Then she said, I pray you despatch me\r\nquickly. Then she kneeled down, saying, Will you take it off before I\r\nlay me down? And the executioner said, No madam. Then she tied a\r\nhandkerchief about her eyes, and feeling for the block, she said, What\r\nshall I do? Where is it? Where is it? One of the standers-by guiding her\r\nthereunto, she laid her head upon the block, and then stretched forth\r\nher body, and said, Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit; and so\r\nfinished her life, in the year of our Lord 1554, the 12th day of\r\nFebruary, about the 17th year of her age.\r\n\r\nThus died the Lady Jane; and on the same day the lord Guilford, her\r\nhusband, one of the duke of Northumberland's sons, was likewise\r\nbeheaded, two innocents in comparison of them that sat upon them. For\r\nthey were both very young, and ignorantly accepted that which others had\r\ncontrived, and by open proclamation consented to take from others, and\r\ngive to them.\r\n\r\nTouching the condemnation of this pious lady, it is to be noted, that\r\nJudge Morgan, who gave sentence against her, soon after he had condemned\r\nher, fell mad, and in his raving cried out continually, to have the lady\r\nJane taken away from him, and so he ended his life.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st day of the same month, Henry, duke of Suffolk, was beheaded\r\non Tower-hill, the fourth day after his condemnation: about which time\r\nmany gentlemen and yeomen were condemned, whereof some were executed at\r\nLondon, and some in the country. In the number of whom was the lord\r\nThomas Gray, brother to the said duke, being apprehended not long after\r\nin North-Wales, and executed for the same. Sir Nicholas Throgmorton,\r\nalso, very narrowly escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Rogers, Vicar of St. Sepulchre's, and Reader of St. Paul's,\r\nLondon._\r\n\r\nJohn Rogers was educated at Cambridge, and was afterward many years\r\nchaplain to the merchants adventurers at Antwerp in Brabant. Here he met\r\nwith the celebrated martyr William Tindal, and Miles Coverdale, both\r\nvoluntary exiles from their country for their aversion to popish\r\nsuperstition and idolatry. They were the instruments of his conversion;\r\nand he united with them in that translation of the Bible into English,\r\nentitled \"The Translation of Thomas Matthew.\" From the scriptures he\r\nknew that unlawful vows may be lawfully broken; hence he married, and\r\nremoved to Wittenberg in Saxony, for the improvement of learning; and he\r\nthere learned the Dutch language, and received the charge of a\r\ncongregation, which he faithfully executed for many years. On king\r\nEdward's accession, he left Saxony, to promote the work of reformation\r\nin England; and, after some time, Nicholas Ridley, then bishop of\r\nLondon, gave him a prebend in St. Paul's Cathedral, and the dean and\r\nchapter appointed him reader of the divinity lesson there. Here he\r\ncontinued until queen Mary's succession to the throne, when the gospel\r\nand true religion were banished, and the Antichrist of Rome, with his\r\nsuperstition and idolatry, introduced.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after\r\nqueen Mary arrived at the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed\r\nin his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and\r\nexhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and\r\nsuperstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended\r\nhimself, that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the\r\nqueen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new\r\nhandle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and\r\ncommanded to keep his house. He did so, though he might have escaped;\r\nand though he perceived the state of the true religion to be desperate.\r\n\"He knew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget\r\na wife and ten children, and to seek means to succour them.\" But all\r\nthese things were insufficient to induce him to depart and, when once\r\ncalled to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded\r\nhis life for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter long imprisonment in his own house, the restless Bonner, bishop of\r\nLondon, caused him to be committed to Newgate, there to be lodged among\r\nthieves and murderers.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Rogers had been long and straitly imprisoned, and lodged in\r\nNewgate among thieves, often examined, and very uncharitably entreated,\r\nand at length unjustly and most cruelly condemned by Stephen Gardiner,\r\nbishop of Winchester: the 4th of February, in the year of our Lord 1555,\r\nbeing Monday in the morning, he was suddenly warned by the keeper of\r\nNewgates's wife, to prepare himself for the fire; who, being then sound\r\nasleep, could scarce be awaked. At length being raised and awaked, and\r\nbid to make haste, Then said he, if it be so, I need not tie my points.\r\nAnd so was had down, first to bishop Bonner to be degraded: which being\r\ndone, he craved of Bonner but one petition; and Bonner asking what that\r\nshould be? Mr. Rogers replied, that he might speak a few words with his\r\nwife before his burning. But that could not be obtained of him.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came, that he should be brought out of Newgate to\r\nSmithfield, the place of his execution, Mr. Woodroofe, one of the\r\nsheriffs, first came to Mr. Rogers, and asked him, if he would revoke\r\nhis abominable doctrine, and the evil opinion of the sacrament of the\r\naltar. Mr. Rogers answered that which I have preached I will seal with\r\nmy blood. Then Mr. Woodroofe said, Thou art an heretic. That shall be\r\nknown, quoth Mr. Rogers, at the day of judgment.--\"Well, said Mr.\r\nWoodroofe, I will never pray for thee. But I will pray for you, said Mr.\r\nRogers; and so was brought the same day, the 4th of February, by the\r\nsheriffs, towards Smithfield, saying the psalm Miserere by the way, all\r\nthe people wonderfully rejoicing at his constancy with great praises and\r\nthanks to God for the same. And here, in the presence of Mr. Rochester,\r\ncomptroller of the queen's household, sir Richard Southwell, both the\r\nsheriffs, and a great number of people he was burnt to ashes, washing\r\nhis hands in the flame as he was burning. A little before his burning,\r\nhis pardon was brought if he would have recanted; but he utterly refused\r\nit. He was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in\r\nQueen Mary's time that gave the first adventure upon the fire. His wife\r\nand children, being eleven in number, ten able to go, and one sucking at\r\nher breast, met him by the way, as he went towards Smithfield: this\r\nsorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him but\r\nthat he constantly and cheerfully took his death with wonderful\r\npatience, in the defence and quarrel of the gospel of Christ.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rev. Mr. Lawrence Saunders._\r\n\r\nMr. Saunders after passing some time in the school of Eaton, was chosen\r\nto go to King's college in Cambridge, where he continued three years,\r\nand profited in knowledge and learning very much for that time shortly\r\nafter he quitted the university, and went to his parents, but soon\r\nreturned to Cambridge again to his study, where he began to add to the\r\nknowledge of the Latin, the study of the Greek and Hebrew tongues, and\r\ngave himself up to the study of the holy scriptures, the better to\r\nqualify himself for the office of preacher.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of king Edward's reign, when God's true religion was\r\nintroduced, after license obtained, he began to preach, and was so well\r\nliked of them who then had authority, that they appointed him to read a\r\ndivinity lecture in the college of Fothringham. The college of\r\nFothringham being dissolved, he was placed to be a reader in the minster\r\nat Litchfield. After a certain space, he departed from Litchfield to a\r\nbenefice in Leicestershire, called Church-langton, where he held a\r\nresidence, taught diligently, and kept a liberal house. Thence he was\r\norderly called to take a benefice in the city of London, namely,\r\nAll-hallows in Bread-street.--After this he preached at Northampton,\r\nnothing meddling with the state, but boldly uttering his conscience\r\nagainst the popish doctrines which were likely to spring up again in\r\nEngland, as a just plague for the little love which the English nation\r\nthen bore to the blessed word of God, which had been so plentifully\r\noffered unto them.\r\n\r\nThe queen's party, who were there, and heard him, were highly displeased\r\nwith him for his sermon, and for it kept him among them as a prisoner.\r\nBut partly for love of his brethren and friends, who were chief actors\r\nfor the queen among them, partly because there was no law broken by his\r\npreaching, they dismissed him.\r\n\r\nSome of his friends, perceiving such fearful menacing, counselled him to\r\nfly out of the realm, which he refused to do. But seeing he was with\r\nviolence kept from doing good in that place, he returned towards London,\r\nto visit his flock.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of Sunday, Oct. 15, 1554, as he was reading in his\r\nchurch to exhort his people, the bishop of London interrupted him, by\r\nsending an officer for him.\r\n\r\nHis treason and sedition the bishop's charity was content to let slip\r\nuntil another time, but a heretic he meant to prove him, and all those,\r\nhe said, who taught and believed that the administration of the\r\nsacraments, and all orders of the church, are the most pure, which come\r\nthe nearest to the order of the primitive church.\r\n\r\nAfter much talk concerning this matter, the bishop desired him to write\r\nwhat he believed of transubstantiation. Laurence Saunders did so,\r\nsaying, \"My Lord, you seek my blood, and you shall have it: I pray God\r\nthat you may be so baptised in it that you may ever after loathe\r\nblood-sucking, and become a better man.\" Upon being closely charged with\r\ncontumacy, the severe replies of Mr. Saunders to the bishop, (who had\r\nbefore, to get the favour of Henry VIII. written and set forth in print,\r\na book of true obedience, wherein he had openly declared queen Mary to\r\nbe a bastard) so irritated him, that he exclaimed, Carry away this\r\nfrenzied fool to prison.\r\n\r\nAfter this good and faithful martyr had been kept in prison one year and\r\na quarter, the bishops at length called him, as they did his\r\nfellow-prisoners, openly to be examined before the queen's council.\r\n\r\nHis examination being ended, the officers led him out of the place, and\r\nstaid until the rest of his fellow-prisoners were likewise examined,\r\nthat they might lead them all together to prison.\r\n\r\nAfter his excommunication and delivery over to the secular power, he was\r\nbrought by the sheriff of London to the Compter, a prison in his own\r\nparish of Bread-street, at which he rejoiced greatly, both because he\r\nfound there a fellow-prisoner, Mr. Cardmaker, with whom he had much\r\nchristian and comfortable discourse; and because out of prison, as\r\nbefore in his pulpit, he might have an opportunity of preaching to his\r\nparishioners. The 4th of February, Bonner, bishop of London, came to the\r\nprison to degrade him; the day following, in the morning the sheriff of\r\nLondon delivered him to certain of the queen's guard, who were appointed\r\nto carry him to the city of Coventry, there to be burnt.\r\n\r\nWhen they had arrived at Coventry, a poor shoemaker, who used to serve\r\nhim with shoes, came to him, and said, O my good master, God strengthen\r\nand comfort you. Good shoemaker, Mr. Saunders replied, I desire thee to\r\npray for me, for I am the most unfit man for this high office, that ever\r\nwas appointed to it; but my gracious God and dear Father is able to make\r\nme strong enough. The next day, being the 8th of February, 1555, he was\r\nled to the place of execution, in the park, without the city; he went in\r\nan old gown and a shirt, bare-footed, and oftentimes fell flat on the\r\nground, and prayed. When he was come nigh to the place, the officer,\r\nappointed to see the execution done, said to Mr. Saunders, that he was\r\none of them who married the queen's realm, but if he would recant, there\r\nwas pardon for him. \"Not I,\" replied the holy martyr, \"but such as you\r\nhave injured the realm. The blessed gospel of Christ is what I hold;\r\nthat do I believe, that have I taught, and that will I never revoke!\"\r\nMr. Saunders then slowly moved towards the fire, sank to the earth and\r\nprayed; he then rose up, embraced the stake, and frequently said,\r\n\"Welcome, thou cross of Christ! welcome everlasting life!\" Fire was then\r\nput to the fagots, and, he was overwhelmed by the dreadful flames, and\r\nsweetly slept in the Lord Jesus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The history, imprisonment, and examinations, of Mr. John Hooper, Bishop\r\nof Worcester and Gloucester._\r\n\r\nJohn Hooper, student and graduate in the university of Oxford, was\r\nstirred with such fervent desire to the love and knowledge of the\r\nscriptures, that he was compelled to remove from thence, and was\r\nretained in the house of Sir Thomas Arundel, as his steward, till Sir\r\nThomas had intelligence of his opinions and religion, which he in no\r\ncase did favour, though he exceedingly favoured his person and\r\ncondition, and wished to be his friend. Mr. Hooper now prudently left\r\nSir Thomas' house and arrived at Paris, but in a short time returned\r\ninto England, and was retained by Mr. Sentlow, till the time that he was\r\nagain molested and sought for, when he passed through France to the\r\nhigher parts of Germany; where, commencing acquaintance with learned\r\nmen, he was by them free and lovingly entertained, both at Basil, and\r\nespecially at Zurich, by Mr. Bullinger, who was his singular friend;\r\nhere also he married his wife, who was a Burgonian, and applied very\r\nstudiously to the Hebrew tongue.\r\n\r\nAt length, when God saw it good to stay the bloody time of the six\r\narticles, and to give us king Edward to reign over this realm, with some\r\npeace and rest unto the church, amongst many other English exiles, who\r\nthen repaired homeward, Mr. Hooper also, moved in conscience, thought\r\nnot to absent himself, but seeing such a time and occasion, offered to\r\nhelp forward the Lord's work, to the uttermost of his ability.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hooper had taken his farewell of Mr. Bullinger, and his friends\r\nin Zurich, he repaired again into England in the reign of king Edward\r\nthe Sixth, and coming to London, used continually to preach, most times\r\ntwice, or at least once a day.\r\n\r\nIn his sermons, according to his accustomed manner, he corrected sin,\r\nand sharply inveighed against the iniquity of the world and the corrupt\r\nabuses of the church. The people in great flocks and companies daily\r\ncame to hear his voice, as the most melodious sound and tune of Orpheus'\r\nharp, insomuch, that oftentimes when he was preaching, the church would\r\nbe so full, that none could enter further than the doors thereof. In his\r\ndoctrine, he was earnest, in tongue eloquent, in the scriptures,\r\nperfect, in pains indefatigable, in his life exemplary.\r\n\r\nHaving preached before the king's majesty, he was soon after made bishop\r\nof Gloucester. In that office he continued two years, and behaved\r\nhimself so well, that his very enemies could find no fault with him, and\r\nafter that he was made bishop of Worcester.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooper executed the office of a most careful and vigilant pastor for\r\nthe space of two years and more, so long as the state of religion in\r\nking Edward's time was sound and flourishing.\r\n\r\nAfter he had been cited to appear before Bonner and Dr. Heath, he was\r\nled to the Council, accused falsely of owing the queen money, and in the\r\nnext year, 1554, he wrote an account of his severe treatment during\r\nnear eighteen months' confinement to the Fleet, and after his third\r\nexamination, January 28, 1555, at St. Mary Overy's, he, with the Rev.\r\nMr. Rogers, was conducted to the Compter in Southwark, there to remain\r\ntill the next day at nine o'clock, to see whether they would recant.\r\nCome, brother Rogers, said Dr. Hooper, must we two take this matter\r\nfirst in hand, and begin to fry in these fagots? Yes, Doctor, said Mr.\r\nRogers, by God's grace. Doubt not, said Dr. Hooper, but God will give us\r\nstrength; and the people so applauded their constancy, that they had\r\nmuch ado to pass.\r\n\r\nJanuary 29, bishop Hooper was degraded and condemned, and the Rev. Mr.\r\nRogers was treated in like manner. At dark, Dr. Hooper was led through\r\nthe city to Newgate; notwithstanding this secrecy, many people came\r\nforth to their doors with lights, and saluted him, praising God for his\r\nconstancy.\r\n\r\nDuring the few days he was in Newgate, he was frequently visited by\r\nBonner and others, but without avail. As Christ was tempted, so they\r\ntempted him, and then maliciously reported that he had recanted. The\r\nplace of his martyrdom being fixed at Gloucester, he rejoiced very much,\r\nlifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, and praising God that he saw it\r\ngood to send him among the people over whom he was pastor, there to\r\nconfirm with his death the truth which he had before taught them.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 7th, he came to Gloucester, about five o'clock, and lodged at\r\none Ingram's house. After his first sleep, he continued in prayer until\r\nmorning; and all the day, except a little time at his meals, and when\r\nconversing with such as the guard kindly permitted to speak to him, he\r\nspent in prayer.\r\n\r\nSir Anthony Kingston, at one time Doctor Hooper's good friend, was\r\nappointed by the queen's letters to attend at his execution. As soon as\r\nhe saw the bishop he burst into tears. With tender entreaties he\r\nexhorted him to live. \"True it is,\" said the bishop, \"that death is\r\nbitter, and life is sweet: but alas! consider that the death to come is\r\nmore bitter, and the life to come is more sweet.\"\r\n\r\nThe same day a blind boy obtained leave to be brought into Dr. Hooper's\r\npresence. The same boy, not long before, had suffered imprisonment at\r\nGloucester for confessing the truth. \"Ah! poor boy,\" said the bishop,\r\n\"though God hath taken from thee thy outward sight, for what reason he\r\nbest knoweth, yet he hath endued thy soul with the eye of knowledge and\r\nof faith. God give thee grace continually to pray unto him, that thou\r\nlose not that sight, for then wouldst thou indeed be blind both in body\r\nand soul.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the mayor waited upon him preparatory to his execution, he\r\nexpressed his perfect obedience, and only requested that a quick fire\r\nmight terminate his torments. After he had got up in the morning, he\r\ndesired that no man should be suffered to come into the chamber, that he\r\nmight be solitary till the hour of execution.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock, on February 9, 1555, he was led forth, and many\r\nthousand persons were collected, as it was market-day. All the way,\r\nbeing straitly charged not to speak, and beholding the people who\r\nmourned bitterly for him, he would sometimes lift up his eyes towards\r\nheaven, and look very cheerfully upon such as he knew: and he was never\r\nknown, during the time of his being among them, to look with so cheerful\r\nand ruddy a countenance as he did at that time. When he came to the\r\nplace appointed where he should die, he smilingly beheld the stake and\r\npreparation made for him, which was near unto the great elm-tree over\r\nagainst the college of priests, where he used to preach.\r\n\r\nNow, after he had entered into prayer, a box was brought and laid before\r\nhim upon a stool, with his pardon from the queen, if he would turn. At\r\nthe sight whereof he cried, If you love my soul away with it. The box\r\nbeing taken away, lord Chandois said, Seeing there is no remedy,\r\ndespatch him quickly.\r\n\r\nCommand was now given that the fire should be kindled. But because there\r\nwere not more green fagots than two horses could carry, it kindled not\r\nspeedily, and was a pretty while also before it took the reeds upon the\r\nfagots. At length it burned about him, but the wind having full strength\r\nat that place, and being a lowering cold morning, it blew the flame from\r\nhim, so that he was in a manner little more than touched by the fire.\r\n\r\nWithin a space after, a few dry fagots were brought, and a new fire\r\nkindled with fagots, (for there were no more reeds) and those burned at\r\nthe nether parts, but had small power above, because of the wind, saving\r\nthat it burnt his hair, and scorched his skin a little. In the time of\r\nwhich fire, even as at the first flame, he prayed, saying mildly, and\r\nnot very loud, but as one without pain, O Jesus, Son of David, have\r\nmercy upon me, and receive my soul! After the second fire was spent, he\r\nwiped both his eyes with his hands, and beholding the people, he said\r\nwith an indifferent loud voice, For God's love, good people, let me have\r\nmore fire! and all this while his nether parts did burn; but the fagots\r\nwere so few, that the flame only singed his upper parts.\r\n\r\nThe third fire was kindled within a while after, which was more extreme\r\nthan the other two. In this fire he prayed with a loud voice, Lord\r\nJesus, have mercy upon me! Lord Jesus receive my spirit! And these were\r\nthe last words he was heard to utter. But when he was black in the\r\nmouth, and his tongue so swollen that he could not speak, yet his lips\r\nwent till they were shrunk to the gums: and he knocked his breast with\r\nhis hands until one of his arms fell off, and then knocked still with\r\nthe other, while the fat, water, and blood dropped out at his fingers'\r\nends, until by renewing the fire, his strength was gone, and his hand\r\nclave fast in knocking to the iron upon his breast. Then immediately\r\nbowing forwards, he yielded up his spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The life and conduct of Dr. Rowland Taylor of Hadley._\r\n\r\nDr. Rowland Taylor, vicar of Hadley, in Suffolk, was a man of eminent\r\nlearning, and had been admitted to the degree of doctor of the civil and\r\ncanon law.\r\n\r\nHis attachment to the pure and uncorrupted principles of christianity\r\nrecommended him to the favour and friendship of Dr. Cranmer, archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, with whom he lived a considerable time, till through his\r\ninterest he obtained the living of Hadley.\r\n\r\nDr. Taylor promoted the interest of the great Redeemer, and the souls of\r\nmankind, both by his preaching and example, during the time of king\r\nEdward VI. but on his demise, and the succession of queen Mary to the\r\nthrone, he escaped not the cloud that burst on so many beside; for two\r\nof his parishioners, Foster, an attorney, and Clark, a tradesman, out of\r\nblind zeal, resolved that mass should be celebrated, in all its\r\nsuperstitious forms, in the parish church of Hadley, on Monday before\r\nEaster; this Dr. Taylor, entering the church, strictly forbade; but\r\nClark forced the Doctor out of the church, celebrated mass, and\r\nimmediately informed the lord-chancellor, bishop of Winchester of his\r\nbehaviour, who summoned him to appear, and answer the complaints that\r\nwere alleged against him.\r\n\r\nThe doctor upon the receipt of the summons, cheerfully prepared to obey\r\nthe same; and rejected the advice of his friends to fly beyond sea. When\r\nGardiner saw Dr. Taylor, he, according to his common custom, reviled\r\nhim. Dr. Taylor heard his abuse patiently, and when the bishop said, How\r\ndarest thou look me in the face! knowest thou not who I am? Dr. Taylor\r\nreplied, You are Dr. Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, and\r\nlord-chancellor, and yet but a mortal man. But if I should be afraid of\r\nyour lordly looks, why fear ye not God, the Lord of us all? With what\r\ncountenance will you appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, and\r\nanswer to your oath made first unto king Henry the Eighth, and afterward\r\nunto king Edward the Sixth, his son?\r\n\r\nA long conversation ensued, in which Dr. Taylor was so piously collected\r\nand severe upon his antagonist, that he exclaimed, Thou art a\r\nblasphemous heretic! Thou indeed blasphemist the blessed sacrament,\r\n(here he put off his cap) and speakest against the holy mass, which is\r\nmade a sacrifice for the quick and the dead. The bishop afterward\r\ncommitted him into the king's bench.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Taylor came there, he found the virtuous and vigilant preacher\r\nof God's word, Mr. Bradford; who equally thanked God that he had\r\nprovided him with such a comfortable fellow-prisoner; and they both\r\ntogether praised God, and continued in prayer, reading and exhorting one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAfter that Dr. Taylor had lain some time in prison, he was cited to\r\nappear in the arches of Bow-church.\r\n\r\nDr. Taylor being condemned, was committed to the Clink, and the keepers\r\nwere charged to treat him roughly; at night he was removed to the\r\nPoultry Compter.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Taylor had lain in the Compter about a week, on the 4th of\r\nFebruary, Bonner came to degrade him, bringing with him such ornaments\r\nas appertained to the massing mummery; but the Doctor refused these\r\ntrappings till they were forced upon him.\r\n\r\nThe night after he was degraded, his wife came with John Hull, his\r\nservant, and his son Thomas, and were by the gentleness of the keepers\r\npermitted to sup with him.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, walking up and down, he gave God thanks for his grace,\r\nthat had so called him and given him strength to abide by his holy word\r\nand turning to his son Thomas, he exhorted him to piety and filial\r\nobedience in the most earnest manner.\r\n\r\nDr. Taylor, about two o'clock in the morning, was conveyed to the\r\nWoolpack, Aldgate, and had an affecting interview with his wife and\r\ndaughter, and a female orphan he had brought up who had waited all night\r\nin St. Botolph's porch, to see him pass, before being delivered to the\r\nsheriff of Essex. On coming out of the gates, John Hull, his good\r\nservant, stood at the rails with Thomas, (Dr. Taylor's son.) This, said\r\nhe, is my own son. Then he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and prayed for\r\nhis son and blessed him.\r\n\r\nAt Chelmsford the sheriff of Suffolk met them, there to receive him, and\r\nto carry him into Suffolk. Being at supper, the sheriff of Essex very\r\nearnestly besought him to return to the popish religion, thinking with\r\nfair words to persuade him. When they had all drunk to him, and the cup\r\nwas come to him, he said, Mr. Sheriff, and my masters all, I heartily\r\nthank you for your good will. I have hearkened to your words, and marked\r\nwell your counsels. And to be plain with you, I perceive that I have\r\nbeen deceived myself, and am like to deceive a great many in Hadley of\r\ntheir expectations. At these words they all rejoiced, but the Doctor had\r\na meaning very remote from theirs. He alluded to the disappointment that\r\nthe worms would have in not being able to feast upon his portly and\r\ngoodly body, which they would have done if, instead of being burnt, he\r\nhad been buried.\r\n\r\nWhen the sheriff and his company heard him speak thus, they were amazed,\r\nmarvelling at the constant mind that could thus without fear make a jest\r\nof the cruel torments and death now at hand, prepared for him. At\r\nChelmsford he was delivered to the sheriff of Suffolk, and by him\r\nconducted to Hadley.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Taylor had arrived at Aldham-Common, the place where he should\r\nsuffer, seeing a great multitude of people, he asked, What place is\r\nthis, and what meaneth it that so much people are gathered hither? It\r\nwas answered, It is Aldham-Common, the place where you must suffer; and\r\nthe people are come to look upon you. Then he said, Thanked be God, I am\r\neven at home; and he alighted from his horse and with both hands rent\r\nthe hood from his head.\r\n\r\nHis head had been notched and clipped like as a man would clip a fool's;\r\nwhich cost the good bishop Bonner had bestowed upon him. But when the\r\npeople saw his reverend and ancient face, with a long white beard, they\r\nburst out with weeping tears, and cried, saying, God save thee, good Dr.\r\nTaylor! Jesus Christ strengthen thee, and help thee! the Holy Ghost\r\ncomfort thee! with such other like good wishes.\r\n\r\nWhen he had prayed, he went to the stake and kissed it, and set himself\r\ninto a pitch barrel, which they had put for him to stand in, and stood\r\nwith his back upright against the stake, with his hands folded together,\r\nand his eyes towards heaven, and continually prayed.\r\n\r\nThey then bound him with the chains, and having set up the fagots, one\r\nWarwick cruelly cast a fagot at him which struck him on his head, and\r\ncut his face, so that the blood ran down. Then said Dr. Taylor, O\r\nfriend, I have harm enough, what needed that?\r\n\r\nSir John Shelton standing by, as Dr. Taylor was speaking, and saying the\r\npsalm Miserere in English, struck him on the lips: You knave, said he,\r\nspeak Latin: I will make thee. At last they kindled the fire; and Dr.\r\nTaylor holding up both his hands, calling upon God, and said, Merciful\r\nFather of heaven! for Jesus Christ, my Saviour's sake, receive my soul\r\ninto thy hands! So he stood still without either crying or moving, with\r\nhis hands folded together, till Soyce, with a halberd struck him on the\r\nhead till his brains fell out, and the corpse fell down into the fire.\r\n\r\nThus rendered up this man of God his blessed soul into the hands of his\r\nmerciful Father, and to his most dear Saviour Jesus Christ, whom he most\r\nentirely loved, faithfully and earnestly preached, obediently followed\r\nin living, and constantly glorified in death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Martyrdom of Tomkins, Pygot, Knight, Lawrence, Hunter, and Higbed._\r\n\r\nThomas Tomkins was by trade a weaver in Shoreditch, till he was summoned\r\nbefore the inhuman Bonner, and confined with many others, who renounced\r\nthe errors of popery, in a prison in that tyrant's house at Fulham.\r\n\r\nUnder his confinement, he was treated by the bishop not only unbecoming\r\na prelate, but even a man; for the savage, because Tomkins would not\r\nassent to the doctrine of transubstantiation, bruised him in the face,\r\nand plucked off the greatest part of the hair of his beard.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, this scandal to humanity, in the presence of many\r\nwho came to visit at Fulham, took this poor honest man by the fingers,\r\nand held his hand directly over the flame of a wax candle having three\r\nor four wicks, supposing that, being terrified by the smart and pain of\r\nthe fire, he would leave off the defence of the doctrine which he had\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nTomkins thinking no otherwise, but there presently to die, began to\r\ncommend himself unto the Lord, saying, O Lord, into thy hands I commend\r\nmy spirit, &c. All the time that his hand was burning the same Tomkins\r\nafterward reported to one James Hinse, that his spirit was so rapt, that\r\nhe felt no pain. In which burning he never shrank till the veins\r\nshrank, and the sinews burst and the water spurted into Mr. Harpsfield's\r\nface: insomuch that Mr. Harpsfield, moved with pity, desired the bishop\r\nto stay, saying, that he had tried him enough.\r\n\r\nAfter undergoing two examinations, and refusing to swerve from his duty\r\nand belief, he was commanded to appear before the bishop.\r\n\r\nAgreeably to this mandate, being brought before the bloody tribunal of\r\nbishops, and pressed to recant his errors and return to the mother\r\nchurch, he maintained his fidelity, nor would swerve in the least from\r\nthe articles he had signed with his own hand. Having therefore declared\r\nhim an obstinate heretic, they delivered him up to the secular power,\r\nand he was burned in Smithfield, March 16th, 1555, triumphant in the\r\nmidst of the flames, and adding to the noble company of martyrs, who had\r\npreceded him through the path of the fiery trial to the realms of\r\nimmortal glory.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hunter had been trained to the doctrines of the reformation from\r\nhis earliest youth, being descended from religious parents, who\r\ncarefully instructed him in the principles of the true religion.\r\n\r\nHunter, then nineteen years of age, refusing to receive the communion at\r\nmass, was threatened to be brought before the bishop; to whom this\r\nvaliant young martyr was conducted by a constable.\r\n\r\nBonner caused William to be brought into a chamber, where he began to\r\nreason with him, promising him security and pardon if he would recant.\r\nNay, he would have been content if he would have gone only to receive\r\nand to confession, but William would not do so for all the world.\r\n\r\nUpon this the bishop commanded his men to put William in the stocks in\r\nhis gate-house, where he sat two days and nights, with a crust of brown\r\nbread and a cup of water only, which he did not touch.\r\n\r\nAt the two days' end, the bishop came to him, and finding him steadfast\r\nin the faith, sent him to the convict prison, and commanded the keeper\r\nto lay irons upon him as many as he could bear. He continued in prison\r\nthree quarters of a year, during which time he had been before the\r\nbishop five times, besides the time when he was condemned in the\r\nconsistory in St. Paul's, February 9th, at which time his brother,\r\nRobert Hunter, was present.\r\n\r\nThen the bishop, calling William, asked him if he would recant, and\r\nfinding he was unchangeable, he pronounced sentence upon him, that he\r\nshould go from that place to Newgate for a time, and thence to\r\nBrentwood, there to be burned.\r\n\r\nAbout a month afterward, William was sent down to Brentwood, where he\r\nwas to be executed. On coming to the stake, he knelt down and read the\r\n51st psalm, till he came to these words, \"The sacrifice of God is a\r\ncontrite spirit; a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not\r\ndespise.\" Steadfast in refusing the queen's pardon, if he would become\r\nan apostate, at length one Richard Ponde, a bailiff, came, and made the\r\nchain fast about him.\r\n\r\nWilliam now cast his psalter into his brother's hand, who said William,\r\nthink on the holy passion of Christ, and be not afraid of death. Behold,\r\nanswered William, I am not afraid. Then he lifted up his hands to\r\nheaven, and said, Lord, Lord, Lord, receive my spirit and casting down\r\nhis head again into the smothering smoke, he yielded up his life for the\r\ntruth, sealing it with his blood to the praise of God.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time William Pygot, Stephen Knight, and Rev. John\r\nLawrence, were burnt as heretics, by order of the infamous Bonner.\r\nThomas Higbed and Thomas Causton shared the same fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. Robert Farrar._\r\n\r\nThis worthy and learned prelate, the bishop of St. David's in Wales,\r\nhaving in the former reign, as well as since the accession of Mary, been\r\nremarkably zealous to promoting the reformed doctrines, and exploding\r\nthe errors of popish idolatry, was summoned, among others, before the\r\npersecuting bishop of Winchester, and other commissioners set apart for\r\nthe abominable work of devastation and massacre.\r\n\r\nHis principal accusers and persecutors, on a charge of praemunire in the\r\nreign of Edward VI. were George Constantine Walter, his servant; Thomas\r\nYoung, chanter of the cathedral, afterward bishop of Bangor, &c. Dr.\r\nFarrar ably replied to the copies of information laid against him,\r\nconsisting of fifty-six articles. The whole process of this trial was\r\nlong and tedious. Delay succeeded delay, and after that Dr. Farrar had\r\nbeen long unjustly detained in custody under sureties, in the reign of\r\nking Edward, because he had been promoted by the duke of Somerset,\r\nwhence after his fall he found fewer friends to support him against such\r\nas wanted his bishopric by the coming in of queen Mary, he was accused\r\nand examined not for any matter of praemunire, but for his faith and\r\ndoctrine; for which he was called before the Bishop of Winchester with\r\nbishop Hooper, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Bradford, Mr. Saunders and others, Feb.\r\n4, 1555; on which day he would also with them have been condemned, but\r\nhis condemnation was deferred, and he sent to prison again, where he\r\ncontinued till Feb. 14, and then was sent into Wales to receive\r\nsentence. He was six times brought up before Henry Morgan, bishop of St.\r\nDavid's, who demanded if he would abjure; from which he zealously\r\ndissented, and appealed to cardinal Pole; notwithstanding which, the\r\nbishop, proceeding in his rage, pronounced him a heretic excommunicate,\r\nand surrendered him to the secular power.\r\n\r\nDr. Farrar, being condemned and degraded, was not long after brought to\r\nthe place of execution in the town of Carmathen, in the market-place of\r\nwhich, on the south side of the market-cross, March 30, 1555, being\r\nSaturday next before Passion-Sunday, he most constantly sustained the\r\ntorments of the fire.\r\n\r\nConcerning his constancy, it is said that one Richard Jones, a knight's\r\nson, coming to Dr. Farrar a little before his death, seemed to lament\r\nthe painfulness of the death he had to suffer; to whom the bishop\r\nanswered, That if he saw him once stir in the pains of his burning, he\r\nought then give no credit to his doctrine; and as he said, so did he\r\nmaintain his promise, patiently standing without emotion, till one\r\nRichard Gravell with a staff struck him down.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rawlins White._\r\n\r\nRawlins White was by his calling and occupation a fisherman, living and\r\ncontinuing in the said trade for the space of twenty years at least, in\r\nthe town of Cardiff, where he bore a very good name amongst his\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nThough the good man was altogether unlearned, and withal very simple,\r\nyet it pleased God to remove him from error and idolatry to a knowledge\r\nof the truth, through the blessed reformation in Edward's reign. He had\r\nhis son taught to read English, and after the little boy could read\r\npretty well, his father every night after supper, summer and winter,\r\nmade the boy read a portion of the holy scriptures, and now and then a\r\npart of some other good book.\r\n\r\nWhen he had continued in his profession the space of five years, king\r\nEdward died, upon whose decease queen Mary succeeded and with her all\r\nkind of superstition crept in. White was taken by the officers of the\r\ntown, as a man suspected of heresy, brought before the bishop Llandaff,\r\nand committed to prison in Chepstow, and at last removed to the castle\r\nof Cardiff, where he continued for the space of one whole year. Being\r\nbrought before the bishop in his chapel, he counselled him by threats\r\nand promises. But as Rawlins would in nowise recant his opinions, the\r\nbishop told him plainly, that he must proceed against him by law, and\r\ncondemn him as a heretic.\r\n\r\nBefore they proceeded to this extremity, the bishop proposed that prayer\r\nshould be said for his conversion. \"This,\" said White, \"is like a godly\r\nbishop, and if your request be godly and right, and you pray as you\r\nought, no doubt God will hear you; pray you, therefore, to your God, and\r\nI will pray to my God.\" After the bishop and his party had done praying,\r\nhe asked Rawlins if he would now revoke. \"You find,\" said the latter,\r\n\"your prayer is not granted, for I remain the same; and God will\r\nstrengthen me in support of this truth.\" After this, the bishop tried\r\nwhat saying mass would do; but Rawlins called all the people to witness\r\nthat he did not bow down to the host. Mass being ended Rawlins was\r\ncalled for again; to whom the bishop used many persuasions; but the\r\nblessed man continued so steadfast to his former profession, that the\r\nbishop's discourse was to no purpose.--The bishop now caused the\r\ndefinitive sentence to be read, which being ended, Rawlins was carried\r\nagain to Cardiff, to a loathsome prison in the town, called Cockmarel,\r\nwhere he passed his time in prayer, and in singing of psalms. In about\r\nthree weeks, the order came from town for his execution.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the place, where his poor wife and children stood\r\nweeping, the sudden sight of them so pierced his heart, that the tears\r\ntrickled down his face. Being come to the altar of his sacrifice, in\r\ngoing towards the stake, he fell down upon his knees, and kissed the\r\nground; and in rising again, a little earth sticking on his face, he\r\nsaid these words, Earth unto earth, and dust unto dust; thou art my\r\nmother, and unto thee I shall return.\r\n\r\nWhen all things were ready, directly over against the stake, in the face\r\nof Rawlins White, there was a standing erected, whereon stept up a\r\npriest, addressing himself to the people, but, as he spoke of the Romish\r\ndoctrines of the sacraments, Rawlins cried out, Ah, thou wicked\r\nhypocrite, dost thou presume to prove thy false doctrine by scripture?\r\nLook in the text that followeth; did not Christ say, \"Do this in\r\nremembrance of me?\"\r\n\r\nThen some that stood by cried out, put fire! set on fire! which being\r\ndone, the straw and reeds cast up a great and sudden flame. In which\r\nflame this good man bathed his hands so long, until such time as the\r\nsinews shrank, and the fat dropped away, saving that once he did, as it\r\nwere, wipe his face with one of them. All this while, which was somewhat\r\nlong, he cried with a loud voice, O Lord, receive my spirit! until he\r\ncould not open his mouth. At last the extremity of the fire was so\r\nvehement against his legs, that they were consumed almost before the\r\nrest of his body was hurt, which made the whole body fall over the chain\r\ninto the fire sooner than it would have done. Thus died this good old\r\nman for his testimony of God's truth, and is now rewarded, no doubt,\r\nwith the crown of eternal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rev. Mr. George Marsh._\r\n\r\nGeorge Marsh, born in the parish of Deane, in the county of Lancaster,\r\nreceived a good education and trade from his parents; about his 25th\r\nyear he married, and lived, blessed with several children, on his farm\r\ntill his wife died. He then went to study at Cambridge, and became the\r\ncurate of the Rev. Mr. Lawrence Saunders, in which duty he constantly\r\nand zealously set forth the truth of God's word, and the false doctrines\r\nof the modern Antichrist.\r\n\r\nBeing confined by Dr. Coles, the bishop of Chester, within the precincts\r\nof his own house, he was kept from any intercourse with his friends\r\nduring four months: his friends and mother, earnestly wished him to have\r\nflown from \"the wrath to come;\" but Mr. Marsh thought that such a step\r\nwould ill agree with that profession he had during nine years openly\r\nmade. He, however, secreted himself, but he had much struggling, and in\r\nsecret prayer begged that God would direct him, through the advice of\r\nhis best friends, for his own glory and to what was best. At length,\r\ndetermined, by a letter he received, boldly to confess the faith of\r\nChrist, he took leave of his mother-in-law and other friends,\r\nrecommending his children to their care and departed for Smethehills,\r\nwhence he was, with others, conducted to Lathum, to undergo examination\r\nbefore the Earl of Derby, Sir William Nores Mr. Sherburn, the parson of\r\nGrapnal, and others. The various questions put to him he answered with a\r\ngood conscience, but when Mr. Sherburn interrogated him upon his belief\r\nof the sacrament of the altar, Mr. Marsh answered like a true\r\nProtestant, that the essence of the bread and wine was not at all\r\nchanged, hence, after receiving dreadful threats from some, and fair\r\nwords from others, for his opinions, he was remanded to ward, where he\r\nlay two nights without any bed.--On Palm Sunday he underwent a second\r\nexamination, and Mr. Marsh much lamented that his fear should at all\r\nhave induced him to prevaricate, and to seek his safety, so long as he\r\ndid not openly deny Christ; and he again cried more earnestly to God for\r\nstrength that he might not be overcome by the subtleties of those who\r\nstrove to overrule the purity of his faith. He underwent three\r\nexaminations before Dr. Coles, who, finding him steadfast in the\r\nProtestant faith, began to read his sentence; but he was interrupted by\r\nthe Chancellor, who prayed the bishop to stay before it was too late.\r\nThe priest then prayed for Mr. Marsh, but the latter, upon being again\r\nsolicited to recant, said he durst not deny his Saviour Christ, lest he\r\nlose his everlasting mercy, and so obtain eternal death. The bishop then\r\nproceeded in the sentence. He was committed to a dark dungeon, and lay\r\ndeprived of the consolation of any one, (for all were afraid to relieve\r\nor communicate with him) till the day appointed came that he should\r\nsuffer. The sheriffs of the city, Amry and Couper, with their officers,\r\nwent to the north gate, and took out Mr. George Marsh, who walked all\r\nthe way with the book in his hand, looking upon the same, whence the\r\npeople said, This man does not go to his death as a thief, nor as one\r\nthat deserveth to die.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the place of execution without the city, near\r\nSpittal-Boughton, Mr. Cawdry, deputy Chamberlain of Chester, showed Mr.\r\nMarsh a writing under a great seal, saying, that it was a pardon for him\r\nif he would recant. He answered, That he would gladly accept the same\r\ndid it not tend to pluck him from God.\r\n\r\nAfter that, he began to speak to the people, showing the cause of his\r\ndeath, and would have exhorted them to stick unto Christ, but one of the\r\nsheriffs prevented him. Kneeling down, he then said his prayers, put off\r\nhis clothes unto his shirt, and was chained to the post, having a number\r\nof fagots under him, and a thing made like a firkin, with pitch and tar\r\nin it, over his head. The fire being unskilfully made, and the wind\r\ndriving it in eddies, he suffered great extremity, which notwithstanding\r\nhe bore with Christian fortitude.\r\n\r\nWhen he had been a long time tormented in the fire without moving,\r\nhaving his flesh so broiled and puffed up, that they who stood before\r\nhim could not see the chain wherewith he was fastened, and therefore\r\nsupposed that he had been dead, suddenly he spread abroad his arms,\r\nsaying. Father of heaven have mercy upon me! and so yielded his spirit\r\ninto the hands of the Lord. Upon this, many of the people said he was a\r\nmartyr and died gloriously patient. This caused the bishop shortly after\r\nto make a sermon in the cathedral church, and therein he affirmed, that\r\nthe said Marsh was a heretic, burnt as such, and was a firebrand in\r\nhell.--Mr. Marsh suffered April 24, 1555.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. William Flower._\r\n\r\nWilliam Flower, otherwise Branch, was born at Snow-hill, in the county\r\nof Cambridge, where he went to school some years, and then came to the\r\nabbey of Ely. After he had remained a while he became a professed monk,\r\nwas made a priest in the same house, and there celebrated and sang mass.\r\nAfter that, by reason of a visitation, and certain injunctions by the\r\nauthority of Henry VIII he took upon him the habit of a secular priest,\r\nand returned to Snow-hill, where he was born, and taught children about\r\nhalf a year.\r\n\r\nHe then went to Ludgate, in Suffolk, and served as a secular priest\r\nabout a quarter of a year; from thence to Stoniland; at length to\r\nTewksbury, where he married a wife, with whom he ever after faithfully\r\nand honestly continued: after marriage he resided at Tewksbury about two\r\nyears, and from thence went to Brosley, where he practised physic and\r\nsurgery; but departing from those parts, he came to London, and finally\r\nsettled at Lambeth, where he and his wife dwelt together: however, he\r\nwas generally abroad, excepting once or twice in a month, to visit and\r\nsee his wife. Being at home upon Easter Sunday morning, he came over the\r\nwater from Lambeth into St. Margaret's church at Westminster; when\r\nseeing a priest, named John Celtham, administering and giving the\r\nsacrament of the altar to the people, and being greatly offended in his\r\nconscience with the priest for the same, he struck and wounded him upon\r\nthe head, and also upon the arm and hand, with his wood knife, the\r\npriest having at the same time in his hand a chalice with the\r\nconsecrated host therein, which became sprinkled with blood.\r\n\r\nMr. Flower, for this injudicious zeal, was heavily ironed, and put into\r\nthe gatehouse at Westminster; and afterward summoned before bishop\r\nBonner and his ordinary, where the bishop, after he had sworn him upon a\r\nbook, ministered articles and interrogations to him.\r\n\r\nAfter examination, the bishop began to exhort him again to return to the\r\nunity of his mother the catholic church, with many fair promises. These\r\nMr. Flower steadfastly rejecting, the bishop ordered him to appear in\r\nthe same place in the afternoon, and in the mean time to consider well\r\nhis former answer; but he, neither apologizing for having struck the\r\npriest, nor swerving from his faith, the bishop assigned him the next\r\nday, April 20th, to receive sentence, if he would not recant. The next\r\nmorning, the bishop accordingly proceeded to the sentence, condemning\r\nand excommunicating him for a heretic, and after pronouncing him to be\r\ndegraded, committed him to the secular power.\r\n\r\nApril 24, St. Mark's eve, he was brought to the place of martyrdom, in\r\nSt. Margaret's churchyard, Westminster, where the fact was committed:\r\nand there coming to the stake, he prayed to Almighty God, made a\r\nconfession of his faith, and forgave all the world.\r\n\r\nThis done, his hand was held up against the stake, and struck off, his\r\nleft hand being fastened behind him. Fire was then set to him and he\r\nburning therein, cried with it loud voice, O thou Son of God, have mercy\r\nupon me! O thou Son of God, receive my soul! three times; his speech\r\nbeing now taken from him, he spoke no more, but notwithstanding he\r\nlifted up the stump with his other arm as long as he could.\r\n\r\nThus he endured the extremity of the fire, and was cruelly tortured for\r\nthe few fagots that were brought being insufficient to burn him, they\r\nwere compelled to strike him down into the fire, where lying along upon\r\nthe ground, his lower part was consumed in the fire, whilst his upper\r\npart was little injured, his tongue moving in his mouth for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rev. John Cardmaker and John Warne._\r\n\r\nMay 30, 1555, the Rev. John Cardmaker, otherwise called Taylor,\r\nprebendary of the church of Wells, and John Warne, upholsterer, of St.\r\nJohn's, Walbrook, suffered together in Smithfield. Mr. Cardmaker, who\r\nfirst was an observant friar before the dissolution of the abbeys,\r\nafterward was a married minister, and in King Edward's time appointed to\r\nbe reader in St. Paul's; being apprehended in the beginning of Queen\r\nMary's reign, with Dr. Barlow, bishop of Bath, he was brought to London,\r\nand put in the Fleet prison, King Edward's laws being yet in force. In\r\nMary's reign, when brought before the bishop of Winchester, the latter\r\noffered them the queen's mercy, if they would recant.\r\n\r\nArticles having been preferred against Mr. John Warne, he was examined\r\nupon them by Bonner, who earnestly exhorted him to recant his opinions.\r\nTo whom he answered, I am persuaded that I am in the right opinion, and\r\nI see no cause to recant; for all the filthiness and idolatry lies in\r\nthe church of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe bishop then, seeing that all his fair promises and terrible\r\nthreatenings could not prevail, pronounced the definitive sentence of\r\ncondemnation, and ordered the 30th of May, 1555, for the execution of\r\nJohn Cardmaker and John Warne, who were brought by the sheriffs to\r\nSmithfield. Being come to the stake, the sheriffs called Mr. Cardmaker\r\naside, and talked with him secretly, during which Mr. Warne prayed, was\r\nchained to the stake, and had wood and reeds set about him.\r\n\r\nThe people were greatly afflicted, thinking that Mr. Cardmaker would\r\nrecant at the burning of Mr. Warne. At length Mr. Cardmaker departed\r\nfrom the sheriffs, and came towards the stake, knelt down, and made a\r\nlong prayer in silence to himself. He then arose up, put off his clothes\r\nto his shirt, and went with a bold courage unto the stake and kissed it;\r\nand taking Mr. Warne by the hand, he heartily comforted him, and was\r\nbound to the stake, rejoicing. The people seeing this so suddenly done,\r\ncontrary to their previous expectation, cried out, God be praised! the\r\nLord strengthen thee, Cardmaker! the Lord Jesus receive thy spirit! And\r\nthis continued while the executioner put fire to them, and both had\r\npassed through the fire to the blessed rest and peace among God's holy\r\nsaints and martyrs, to enjoy the crown of triumph and victory prepared\r\nfor the elect soldiers and warriors of Christ Jesus in his blessed\r\nkingdom, to whom be glory and majesty for ever. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Simpson and John Ardeley._\r\n\r\nJohn Simpson and John Ardeley were condemned on the same day with Mr.\r\nCardmaker and John Warne, which was the 25th of May. They were shortly\r\nafter sent down from London to Essex, where they were burnt in one day,\r\nJohn Simpson at Rochford, and John Ardeley at Railey, glorifying God in\r\nhis beloved Son, and rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Haukes, Thomas Watts, Thomas Osmond, William Bamford, and\r\nNicholas Chamberlain._\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Haukes, with six others, were condemned on the 9th of\r\nFebruary, 1555. In education he was erudite; in person, comely and of\r\ngood stature; in manners, a gentleman, and a sincere Christian. A little\r\nbefore death, several of Mr. H's. friends, terrified by the sharpness of\r\nthe punishment he was going to suffer, privately desired that in the\r\nmidst of the flames he would show them some token, whether the pains of\r\nburning were so great that a man might not collectedly endure it. This\r\nhe promised to do; and it was agreed, that if the rage of the pain might\r\nhe suffered, then he should lift up his hands above his head towards\r\nheaven, before he gave up the ghost.\r\n\r\nNot long after, Mr. Haukes was led away to the place appointed for\r\nslaughter, by lord Rich, and being come to the stake, mildly and\r\npatiently prepared himself for the fire, having a strong chain cast\r\nabout his middle, with a multitude of people on every side compassing\r\nhim about. Unto whom after he had spoken many things, and poured out his\r\nsoul unto God, the fire was kindled.\r\n\r\nWhen he had continued long in it, and his speech was taken away by\r\nviolence of the flame, his skin drawn together, and his fingers consumed\r\nwith the fire, so that it was thought that he was gone, suddenly and\r\ncontrary to all expectation, this good man being mindful of his promise,\r\nreached up his hands burning in flames over his head to the living God,\r\nand with great rejoicings as it seemed, struck or clapped them three\r\ntimes together. A great shout followed this wonderful circumstance, and\r\nthen this blessed martyr of Christ, sinking down in the fire, gave up\r\nhis spirit, June 10, 1555.\r\n\r\nThomas Watts, of Billericay, in Essex, of the diocess of London, was a\r\nlinen draper. He had daily expected to be taken by God's adversaries,\r\nand this came to pass on the 5th of April, 1555, when he was brought\r\nbefore lord Rich, and other commissioners at Chelmsford, and accused for\r\nnot coming to the church.\r\n\r\nBeing consigned over to the bloody bishop, who gave him several\r\nhearings, and, as usual, many arguments, with much entreaty, that he\r\nwould be a disciple of antichrist, but his preaching availed not, and he\r\nresorted to his last revenge--that of condemnation.\r\n\r\nAt the stake, after he had kissed it, he spake to lord Rich, charging\r\nhim to repent, for the Lord would revenge his death. Thus did this good\r\nmartyr offer his body to the fire, in defence of the true gospel of the\r\nSaviour.\r\n\r\nThomas Osmond, William Bamford, and Nicholas Chamberlain, all of the\r\ntown of Coxhall, being sent up to be examined, Bonner, after several\r\nhearings, pronounced them obstinate heretics, and delivered them to the\r\nsheriffs, in whose custody they remained till they were delivered to the\r\nsheriff of Essex county, and by him were executed. Chamberlain at\r\nColchester, the 14th of June; Thomas Osmond at Maningtree, and William\r\nBamford, alias Butler, at Harwich, the 15th of June, 1555; all dying\r\nfull of the glorious hope of immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rev. John Bradford, and John Leaf an apprentice._\r\n\r\nRev. John Bradford was born at Manchester, in Lancashire; he was a good\r\nLatin scholar, and afterward became a servant of Sir John Harrington,\r\nknight.\r\n\r\nHe continued several years in an honest and thriving way; but the Lord\r\nhad elected him to a better function. Hence he departed from his master,\r\nquitting the Temple, at London, for the university of Cambridge, to\r\nlearn, by God's law, how to further the building of the Lord's temple.\r\nIn a few years after, the university gave him the degree of master of\r\narts, and he became a fellow of Pembroke Hall.\r\n\r\nMartin Bucer first urged him to preach, and when he modestly doubted his\r\nability, Bucer was wont to reply, If thou hast not fine wheat bread, yet\r\ngive the poor people barley bread, or whatsoever else the Lord hath\r\ncommitted unto thee. Dr. Ridley, that worthy bishop of London, and\r\nglorious martyr of Christ, first called him to take the degree of a\r\ndeacon and gave him a prebend in his cathedral church of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nIn this preaching office Mr. Bradford diligently laboured for the space\r\nof three years. Sharply he reproved sin, sweetly he preached Christ\r\ncrucified, ably he disproved heresies and errors, earnestly he persuaded\r\nto godly life. After the death of blessed king Edward VI. Mr. Bradford\r\nstill continued diligent in preaching, till he was suppressed by queen\r\nMary. An act now followed of the blackest ingratitude, and at which a\r\nPagan would blush. It has been recited, that a tumult was occasioned by\r\nMr. Bourne's (then bishop of Bath) preaching at St. Paul's Cross; the\r\nindignation of the people placed his life in imminent danger; indeed a\r\ndagger was thrown at him. In this situation he entreated Mr. Bradford,\r\nwho stood behind him, to speak in his place, and assuage the tumult. The\r\npeople welcomed Mr. Bradford, and the latter afterward kept close to\r\nhim, that his presence might prevent the populace from renewing their\r\nassaults.\r\n\r\nThe same Sunday in the afternoon, Mr. Bradford preached at Bow church in\r\nCheapside, and reproved the people sharply for their seditious\r\nmisdemeanor. Notwithstanding this conduct, within three days after, he\r\nwas sent for to the tower of London, where the queen then was, to appear\r\nbefore the council. There he was charged with this act of saving Mr.\r\nBourne, which was called seditious, and they also objected against him\r\nfor preaching. Thus he was committed, first to the Tower, then to other\r\nprisons, and, after his condemnation, to the Poultry Compter, where he\r\npreached twice a day continually, unless sickness hindered him. Such was\r\nhis credit with the keeper of the king's Bench, that he permitted him in\r\nan evening to visit a poor, sick person near the Steel-yard, upon his\r\npromise to return in time, and in this he never failed.\r\n\r\nThe night before he was sent to Newgate, he was troubled in his sleep by\r\nforeboding dreams, that on Monday after he should be burned in\r\nSmithfield. In the afternoon the keeper's wife came up and announced\r\nthis dreadful news to him, but in him it excited only thankfulness to\r\nGod. At night, half a dozen friends came, with whom he spent all the\r\nevening in prayer and godly exercises.\r\n\r\nWhen he was removed to Newgate, a weeping crowd accompanied him, and a\r\nrumor having been spread that he was to suffer at four the next morning,\r\nan immense multitude attended. At nine o'clock Mr. Bradford was brought\r\ninto Smithfield. The cruelty of the sheriff deserves notice; for his\r\nbrother-in-law, Roger Beswick, having taken him by the hand as he\r\npassed, Mr. Woodroffe, with his staff, cut his head open.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradford, being come to the place, fell flat on the ground, secretly\r\nmaking his prayers to Almighty God. Then, rising again, and putting off\r\nhis clothes unto the shirt, he went to the stake, and there suffered\r\nwith a young man of twenty years of age, whose name was John Leaf, an\r\napprentice to Mr. Humphry Gaudy, tallow-chandler, of Christ-church,\r\nLondon. Upon Friday before Palm Sunday, he was committed to the Compter\r\nin Bread-street, and afterward examined and condemned by the bloody\r\nbishop.\r\n\r\nIt is reported of him, that, when the bill of his confession was read\r\nunto him, instead of pen, he took a pin, and pricking his hand,\r\nsprinkled the blood upon the said bill, desiring the reader thereof to\r\nshow the bishop that he had sealed the same bill with his blood already.\r\n\r\nThey both ended this mortal life, July 12th, 1555, like two lambs,\r\nwithout any alteration of their countenances, hoping to obtain that\r\nprize they had long run for; to which may Almighty God conduct us all,\r\nthrough the merits of Christ our Saviour! We shall conclude this article\r\nwith mentioning, that Mr. Sheriff Woodroffe, it is said, within half a\r\nyear after, was struck on the right side with a palsy and for the space\r\nof eight years after, (till his dying day) he was unable to turn\r\nhimself in his bed; thus he became at last a fearful object to behold.\r\n\r\nThe day after Mr. Bradford and John Leaf suffered in Smithfield, William\r\nMinge, priest, died in prison at Maidstone. With as great constancy and\r\nboldness he yielded up his life in prison, as if it had pleased God to\r\nhave called him to suffer by fire, as other godly men had done before at\r\nthe stake, and as he himself was ready to do, had it pleased God to have\r\ncalled him to this trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rev. John Bland, Rev. John Frankesh, Nicholas Shetterden, and Humphrey\r\nMiddleton._\r\n\r\nThese Christian persons were all burnt at Canterbury for the same cause.\r\nFrankesh and Bland were ministers and preachers of the word of God, the\r\none being parson of Adesham, and the other vicar of Rolvindon. Mr. Bland\r\nwas cited to answer for his opposition to antichristianism, and\r\nunderwent several examinations before Dr. Harpsfield, archdeacon of\r\nCanterbury, and finally on the 25th of June, 1555, again withstanding\r\nthe power of the pope, he was condemned, and delivered to the secular\r\narm. On the same day were condemned, John Frankesh, Nicholas Shetterden,\r\nHumphrey Middleton, Thacker, and Cocker, of whom Thacker only recanted.\r\n\r\nBeing delivered to the secular power, Mr. Bland, with the three former,\r\nwere all burnt together at Canterbury, July 12, 1555, at two several\r\nstakes, but in one fire, when they, in the sight of God and his angels,\r\nand before men, like true soldiers of Jesus Christ, gave a constant\r\ntestimony to the truth of his holy gospel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nicholas Hall and Christopher Waid._\r\n\r\nThe same month of July, Nicholas Hall, bricklayer, and Christopher Waid,\r\nlinendraper, of Dartford, suffered death, condemned by Maurice, bishop\r\nof Rochester, about the last day of June, 1555. At the same time three\r\nothers were condemned, whose names were Joan Beach, widow, John Harpol,\r\nof Rochester, and Margery Polley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dirick Carver and John Launder._\r\n\r\nThe 22d of July, 1555, Dirick Carver, brewer, of Brighthelmstone, aged\r\nforty, was burnt at Lewes. And the day following John Launder,\r\nhusbandman, aged twenty-five, of Godstone, Surry, was burnt at Stening.\r\n\r\nDirick Carver was a man whom the Lord had blessed as well with temporal\r\nriches as with his spiritual treasures. At his coming into the town of\r\nLewes to be burnt, the people called to him, beseeching God to\r\nstrengthen him in the faith of Jesus Christ; and, as he came to the\r\nstake, he knelt down, and prayed earnestly. Then his book was thrown\r\ninto the barrel, and when he had stripped himself, he went into it. As\r\nsoon as he was in, he took the book, and threw it among the people, upon\r\nwhich the sheriff commanded, in the name of the king and queen, on pain\r\nof death, to throw in the book again.--And immediately the holy martyr\r\nbegan to address the people. After he had prayed awhile, he said, \"O\r\nLord my God, thou hast written, he that will not forsake wife, children,\r\nhouse, and every thing that he hath, and take up thy cross and follow\r\nthee, is not worthy of thee!--but thou, Lord, knowest that I have\r\nforsaken all to come unto thee Lord have mercy upon me, for unto thee I\r\ncommend my spirit! and my soul doth rejoice in thee!\" These were the\r\nlast words of this faithful servant of Christ before enduring the fire.\r\nAnd when the fire came to him, he cried, \"O Lord have mercy upon me!\"\r\nand sprang up in the fire, calling upon the name of Jesus, till he gave\r\nup the ghost.\r\n\r\nThomas Iveson, of Godstone, in the county of Surry, carpenter, was burnt\r\nabout the same month at Chichester.\r\n\r\nJohn Aleworth, who died in prison at Reading, July, 1555, had been\r\nimprisoned for the sake of the truth of the gospel.\r\n\r\nJames Abbes. This young man wandered about to escape apprehension, but\r\nwas at last informed against, and brought before the bishop of Norwich,\r\nwho influenced him to recant; to secure him further in apostasy, the\r\nbishop afterward gave him a piece of money; but the interference of\r\nProvidence is here remarkable. This bribe lay so heavily upon his\r\nconscience, that he returned, threw back the money, and repented of his\r\nconduct. Like Peter, he was contrite, steadfast in the faith, and sealed\r\nit with his blood at Bury, August 2, 1555, praising and glorifying God.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Denley, Gent., John Newman, and Patrick Packingham._\r\n\r\nMr. Denley and Newman were returning one day to Maidstone, the place of\r\ntheir abode, when they were met by E. Tyrrel, Esq. a bigoted justice of\r\nthe peace in Essex, and a cruel persecutor of the protestants. He\r\napprehended them merely on suspicion. On the 5th of July, 1555, they\r\nwere condemned, and consigned to the sheriffs, who sent Mr. Denley to\r\nUxbridge, where he perished, August the 8th, 1555. While suffering in\r\nagony, and singing a psalm, Dr. Story inhumanly ordered one of the\r\ntormentors to throw a fagot at him, which cut his face severely, caused\r\nhim to cease singing, and to raise his hands to his face. Just as Dr.\r\nStory was remarking in jest that he had spoiled a good song, the pious\r\nmartyr again chanted, spread his hands abroad in the flames, and through\r\nChrist Jesus resigned his soul into the hands of his Maker.\r\n\r\nMr. Packingham suffered at the same town on the 28th of the same month.\r\n\r\nMr. Newman, pewterer, was burnt at Saffron Waldon, in Essex, Aug. 31,\r\nfor the same cause, and Richard Hook about the same time perished at\r\nChichester.\r\n\r\n\r\n_W. Coker, W. Hooper, H. Laurence, R. Colliar, R. Wright and W. Stere._\r\n\r\nThese persons all of Kent, were examined at the same time with Mr. Bland\r\nand Shetterden, by Thornton, bishop of Dover, Dr. Harpsfield, and\r\nothers. These six martyrs and witnesses of the truth were consigned to\r\nthe flames in Canterbury, at the end of August, 1555.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Warne, widow of John Warne, upholsterer, martyr, was burnt at\r\nStratford-le-bow, near London, at the end of August, 1555.\r\n\r\nGeorge Tankerfield, of London, cook, born at York, aged 27, in the reign\r\nof Edward VI. had been a papist; but the cruelty of bloody Mary made him\r\nsuspect the truth of those doctrines which were enforced by fire and\r\ntorture. Tankerfield was imprisoned in Newgate about the end of\r\nFebruary, 1555, and on Aug. 26, at St. Alban's, he braved the\r\nexcruciating fire, and joyfully died for the glory of his Redeemer.\r\n\r\nRev. Robert Smith was first in the service of Sir T. Smith, provost of\r\nEton; and was afterward removed to Windsor, where he had a clerkship of\r\nten pounds a year.\r\n\r\nHe was condemned, July 12, 1555, and suffered Aug. 8, at Uxbridge. He\r\ndoubted not but that God would give the spectators some token in support\r\nof his own cause; this actually happened; for, when he was nearly half\r\nburnt, and supposed to be dead, he suddenly rose up, moved the remaining\r\nparts of his arms and praised God; then, hanging over the fire, he\r\nsweetly slept in the Lord Jesus.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen Harwood and Mr. Thomas Fust suffered about the same time\r\nwith Smith and Tankerfield, with whom they were condemned. Mr. William\r\nHale, also, of Thorp, in Essex, was sent to Barnet, where about the same\r\ntime he joined the ever-blessed company of Martyrs.\r\n\r\nGeorge King, Thomas Leyes, and John Wade, falling sick in Lollard's\r\nTower, were removed to different houses, and died. Their bodies were\r\nthrown out in the common fields as unworthy of burial, and lay till the\r\nfaithful conveyed them away by night.\r\n\r\nJoan Lashford, daughter-in-law of John and Elizabeth Warne, martyr, was\r\nthe last of the ten condemned before alluded to; her martyrdom took\r\nplace in 1556, of which we shall speak in its date.\r\n\r\nMr. William Andrew of Horseley, Essex, was imprisoned in Newgate for\r\nheresy; but God chose to call him to himself by the severe treatment he\r\nendured in Newgate, and thus to mock the sanguinary expectations of his\r\nCatholic persecutors. His body was thrown into the open air, but his\r\nsoul was received into the everlasting mansions of his heavenly Creator.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rev. Robert Samuel._\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was minister of Bradford, Suffolk, where he industriously\r\ntaught the flock committed to his charge, while he was openly permitted\r\nto discharge his duty. He was first persecuted by Mr. Foster, of\r\nCopdock, near Ipswich, a severe and bigoted persecutor of the followers\r\nof Christ, according to the truth in the Gospel. Notwithstanding Mr.\r\nSamuel was ejected from his living, he continued to exhort and instruct\r\nprivately; nor would he obey the order for putting away his wife, whom\r\nhe had married in king Edward's reign; but kept her at Ipswich, where\r\nFoster, by warrant, surprised him by night with her. After being\r\nimprisoned in Ipswich jail, he was taken before Dr. Hopton, bishop of\r\nNorwich, and Dr. Dunnings, his chancellor, two of the most sanguinary\r\namong the bigots of those days. To intimidate the worthy pastor, he was\r\nin prison chained to a post in such a manner that the weight of his body\r\nwas supported by the points of his toes: added to this his allowance of\r\nprovision was reduced to a quantity so insufficient to sustain nature,\r\nthat he was almost ready to devour his own flesh. From this dreadful\r\nextremity there was even a degree of mercy in ordering him to the fire.\r\nMr. Samuel suffered August 31, 1555.\r\n\r\nWilliam Allen, a labouring servant to Mr. Houghton of Somerton suffered\r\nnot long after Mr. Samuel, at Walsingham.\r\n\r\nRoger Coo, was an aged man, and brought before the bishop of Norwich for\r\ncontumacy, by whom he was condemned Aug. 12, 1555, and suffered in the\r\nfollowing month at Yoxford, in Suffolk.\r\n\r\nThomas Cobb, was a butcher at Haverhill, and condemned by Dunnings, the\r\nfurious chancellor of Norwich. Mr. Cobb suffered at Thetford, Sept.\r\n1555.\r\n\r\n\r\n_G. Catmer, R. Streater, A. Burward, G. Brodbridge, and J. Tutty._\r\n\r\nThese five worthies, denying the real presence in the eucharist, were\r\nbrought before Dr. Thornton, bishop of Dover, and condemned as heretics.\r\nThey suffered in one fire, Sept. 6, 1555, at Canterbury, enduring all\r\nthings for their faith in Christ Jesus.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time William Glowd, Cornelius Bungey, William Wolsey, and\r\nRobert Pygot, suffered martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Ridley and Bishop Latimer._\r\n\r\nThese reverend prelates suffered October 17, 1555, at Oxford, on the\r\nsame day Wolsey and Pygot perished at Ely. Pillars of the church and\r\naccomplished ornaments of human nature, they were the admiration of the\r\nrealm, amiably conspicuous in their lives, and glorious in their deaths.\r\n\r\nDr. Ridley was born in Northumberland, was first taught grammar at\r\nNewcastle, and afterward removed to Cambridge, where his aptitude in\r\neducation raised him gradually till he came to be the head of Pembroke\r\ncollege, where he received the title of Doctor of Divinity. Having\r\nreturned from a trip to Paris, he was appointed Chaplain to Henry VIII.\r\nand Bishop of Rochester, and was afterwards translated to the see of\r\nLondon in the time of Edward VI.\r\n\r\nHis tenacious memory, extensive erudition, impressive oratory, and\r\nindefatigable zeal in preaching, drew after him not only his own flock,\r\nbut persons from all quarters, desirous of godly exhortation or reproof.\r\nHis tender treatment of Dr. Heath, who was a prisoner with him during\r\none year, in Edward's reign, evidently proves that he had no Catholic\r\ncruelty in his disposition. In person he was erect and well\r\nproportioned; in temper forgiving; in self-mortification severe. His\r\nfirst duty in the morning was private prayer: he remained in his study\r\ntill 10 o'clock, and then attended the daily prayer used in his house.\r\nDinner being done, he sat about an hour, conversing pleasantly, or\r\nplaying at chess. His study next engaged his attention, unless business\r\nor visits occurred; about five o'clock prayers followed; and after he\r\nwould recreate himself at chess for about an hour, then retire to his\r\nstudy till eleven o'clock, and pray on his knees as in the morning. In\r\nbrief, he was a pattern of godliness and virtue, and such he endeavored\r\nto make men wherever he came.\r\n\r\nHis attentive kindness was displayed particularly to old Mrs. Bonner,\r\nmother of Dr. Bonner, the cruel bishop of London. Dr. Ridley, when at\r\nhis manor at Fulham, always invited her to his house, placed her at the\r\nhead of his table, and treated her like his own mother; he did the same\r\nby Bonner's sister and other relatives; but when Dr. Ridley was under\r\npersecution, Bonner pursued a conduct diametrically opposite, and would\r\nhave sacrificed Dr. Ridley's sister and her husband, Mr. George\r\nShipside, had not Providence delivered him by the means of Dr. Heath,\r\nbishop of Worcester. Dr. Ridley was first in part converted by reading\r\nBertram's book on the sacrament, and by his conferences with archbishop\r\nCranmer and Peter Martyr. When Edward VI. was removed from the throne,\r\nand the bloody Mary succeeded, bishop Ridley was immediately marked as\r\nan object of slaughter. He was first sent to the Tower, and afterward,\r\nat Oxford, was consigned to the common prison of Bocardo, with\r\narchbishop Cranmer and Mr. Latimer. Being separated from them, he was\r\nplaced in the house of one Irish, where he remained till the day of his\r\nmartyrdom, from 1554, till October 16, 1555. It will easily be supposed\r\nthat the conversations of these chiefs of the martyrs were elaborate,\r\nlearned, and instructive. Such indeed they were, and equally beneficial\r\nto all their spiritual comforts. Bishop Ridley's letters to various\r\nChristian brethren in bonds in all parts, and his disputations with the\r\nmitred enemies of Christ, alike prove the clearness of his head and the\r\nintegrity of his heart. In a letter to Mr. Grindal, (afterward\r\narchbishop of Canterbury,) he mentions with affection those who had\r\npreceded him in dying for the faith, and those who were expected to\r\nsuffer; he regrets that popery is re-established in its full\r\nabomination, which he attributes to the wrath of God, made manifest in\r\nreturn for the lukewarmness of the clergy and the people in justly\r\nappreciating the blessed light of the reformation.\r\n\r\nBishop Latimer was the son of Hugh Latimer, of Turkelson, in\r\nLeicestershire, a husbandman of repute, with whom he remained till he\r\nwas four years old. His parents, finding him of acute parts, gave him a\r\ngood education, and then sent him at fourteen to the university of\r\nCambridge, where he entered into the study of the school divinity of\r\nthat day, and was from principle a zealous observer of the Romish\r\nsuperstitions of the time. In his oration when he commenced bachelor of\r\ndivinity, he inveighed against the reformer Melancthon, and openly\r\ndeclaimed against good Mr. Stafford, divinity lecturer in Cambridge.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Bilney, moved by a brotherly pity towards Mr. Latimer, begged\r\nto wait upon him in his study, and to explain to him the groundwork of\r\nhis (Mr. Bilney's) faith. This blessed interview effected his\r\nconversion: the persecutor of Christ became his zealous advocate, and\r\nbefore Dr. Stafford died he became reconciled to him.\r\n\r\nOnce converted, he became eager for the conversion of others, and\r\ncommenced public preacher, and private instructer in the university. His\r\nsermons were so pointed against the absurdity of praying in the Latin\r\ntongue, and withholding the oracles of salvation from the people who\r\nwere to be saved by belief in them, that he drew upon himself the pulpit\r\nanimadversions of several of the resident friars and heads of houses,\r\nwhom he subsequently silenced by his severe criticisms and eloquent\r\narguments. This was at Christmas, 1529. At length Dr. West preached\r\nagainst Mr. Latimer at Barwell Abbey, and prohibited him from preaching\r\nagain in the churches of the university, notwithstanding which, he\r\ncontinued during three years to advocate openly the cause of Christ, and\r\neven his enemies confessed the power of those talents he possessed. Mr.\r\nBilney remained here some time with Mr. Latimer, and thus the place\r\nwhere they frequently walked together obtained the name of Heretics'\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nMr. Latimer at this time traced out the innocence of a poor woman,\r\naccused by her husband of the murder of her child. Having preached\r\nbefore king Henry VIII. at Windsor, he obtained the unfortunate mother's\r\npardon. This, with many other benevolent acts, served only to excite the\r\nspleen of his adversaries. He was summoned before Cardinal Wolsey for\r\nheresy, but being a strenuous supporter of the king's supremacy, in\r\nopposition to the pope's, by favour of lord Cromwell and Dr. Buts, (the\r\nking's physician,) he obtained the living of West Kingston, in\r\nWiltshire. For his sermons here against purgatory, the immaculacy of the\r\nVirgin, and the worship of images, he was cited to appear before Warham,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, and John, bishop of London. He was required to\r\nsubscribe certain articles, expressive of his conformity to the\r\naccustomed usages; and there is reason to think, after repeated weekly\r\nexaminations, that he did subscribe, as they did not seem to involve any\r\nimportant article of belief. Guided by Providence, he escaped the subtle\r\nnets of his persecutors, and at length, through the powerful friends\r\nbefore mentioned, became bishop of Worcester, in which function he\r\nqualified or explained away most of the papal ceremonies he was for\r\nform's sake under the necessity of complying with. He continued in this\r\nactive and dignified employment some years, till the coming in of the\r\nSix Articles, when, to preserve an unsullied conscience, he, as well as\r\nDr. Shaxton, bishop of Salisbury, resigned. He remained a prisoner in\r\nthe Tower till the coronation of Edward VI. when he was again called to\r\nthe Lord's harvest in Stamford, and many other places: he also preached\r\nat London in the convocation house, and before the young king; indeed he\r\nlectured twice every Sunday, regardless of his great age (then above\r\nsixty-seven years,) and his weakness through a bruise received from the\r\nfall of a tree. Indefatigable in his private studies, he rose to them in\r\nwinter and in summer at two o'clock in the morning. By the strength of\r\nhis own mind, or of some inward light from above, he had a prophetic\r\nview of what was to happen to the church in Mary's reign, asserting that\r\nhe was doomed to suffer for the truth, and that Winchester, then in the\r\nTower, was preserved for that purpose. Soon after queen Mary was\r\nproclaimed, a messenger was sent to summon Mr. Latimer to town, and\r\nthere is reason to believe it was wished that he should make his escape.\r\nOn entering Smithfield, he jocosely said, that the place had long\r\ngroaned for him. After being examined by the council, he was committed\r\nto the Tower, where his cheerfulness is displayed in the following\r\nanecdote. Being kept without fire in severe frosty weather, his aged\r\nframe suffered so much, that he told the lieutenant's man, that if he\r\ndid not look better after him he should deceive his master. The\r\nlieutenant, thinking he meant to effect his escape, came to him, to know\r\nwhat he meant by this speech; which Mr. Latimer replied to, by saying,\r\n\"You, Mr. Lieutenant, doubtless suppose I shall _burn_; but, except you\r\nlet me have some fire, I shall deceive your expectation, for here it is\r\nlikely I shall be _starved with cold_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Latimer, after remaining a long time in the Tower, was transported\r\nto Oxford, with Cranmer and Ridley, the disputations at which place have\r\nbeen already mentioned in a former part of this work. He remained\r\nimprisoned till October, and the principal objects of all his prayers\r\nwere three--that he might stand faithful to the doctrine he had\r\nprofessed, that God would restore his gospel to England once again, and\r\npreserve the Lady Elizabeth to be queen; all which happened. When he\r\nstood at the stake without the Bocardo-gate, Oxford, with Dr. Ridley,\r\nand fire was putting to the pile of fagots, he raised his eyes\r\nbenignantly towards heaven, and said, \"God is faithful, who doth not\r\nsuffer us to be tempted above our strength.\" His body was forcibly\r\npenetrated by the fire, and the blood flowed abundantly from the heart;\r\nas if to verify his constant desire that his heart's blood might be shed\r\nin defence of the gospel. His polemical and friendly letters are lasting\r\nmonuments of his integrity and talents. It has been before said, that\r\npublic disputation took place in April, 1554, new examinations took\r\nplace in Oct. 1555, previous to the degradation and condemnation of\r\nCranmer, Ridley, and Latimer. We now draw to the conclusion of the lives\r\nof the two last.\r\n\r\nDr. Ridley, the night before execution, was very facetious, had himself\r\nshaved, and called his supper a marriage feast; he remarked upon seeing\r\nMrs. Irish (the keeper's wife) weep, \"though my breakfast will be\r\nsomewhat sharp, my supper will be more pleasant and sweet.\" The place of\r\ndeath was on the north side of the town opposite Baliol College:--Dr.\r\nRidley was dressed in a black gown furred, and Mr. Latimer had a long\r\nshroud on, hanging down to his feet. Dr. Ridley, as he passed Bocardo,\r\nlooked up to see Dr. Cranmer, but the latter was then engaged in\r\ndisputation with a friar.--When they came to the stake, Dr. Ridley\r\nembraced Latimer fervently, and bid him be of good heart. He then knelt\r\nby the stake, and after earnestly praying together, they had a short\r\nprivate conversation. Dr. Smith then preached a short sermon against the\r\nmartyrs, who would have answered him, but were prevented by Dr. Marshal,\r\nthe vice-chancellor. Dr. Ridley then took off his gown and tippet, and\r\ngave them to his brother-in-law, Mr. Shipside. He gave away also many\r\ntrifles to his weeping friends, and the populace were anxious to get\r\neven a fragment of his garments. Mr. Latimer gave nothing, and from the\r\npoverty of his garb, was soon stripped to his shroud, and stood\r\nvenerable and erect, fearless of death. Dr. Ridley being unclothed to\r\nhis shirt, the smith placed an iron chain about their waists, and Dr.\r\nRidley bid him fasten it securely; his brother having tied a bag of\r\ngunpowder about his neck, gave some also to Mr. Latimer. Dr. Ridley then\r\nrequested of Lord Williams, of Fame, to advocate with the queen the\r\ncause of some poor men to whom he had, when bishop, granted leases, but\r\nwhich the present bishop refused to confirm. A lighted fagot was now\r\nlaid at Dr. Ridley's feet, which caused Mr. Latimer to say, \"Be of good\r\ncheer, Ridley; and play the man. We shall this day, by God's grace,\r\nlight up such a candle in England, as, I trust, will never be put out.\"\r\nWhen Dr. Ridley saw the flame approaching him, he exclaimed, \"Into thy\r\nhands, O Lord, I commend my spirit!\" and repeated often, \"Lord receive\r\nmy spirit!\" Mr. Latimer, too, ceased not to say, \"O Father of heaven\r\nreceive my soul!\" Embracing the flame, he bathed his hands in it, and\r\nsoon died, apparently with little pain; but Dr. Ridley, by the\r\nill-adjustment of the fagots, which were green, and placed too high\r\nabove the furze was burnt much downwards. At this time, piteously\r\nentreating for more fire to come to him, his brother-in-law imprudently\r\nheaped the fagots up over him, which caused the fire more fiercely to\r\nburn his limbs, whence he literally leaped up and down under the fagots,\r\nexclaiming that he could not burn; indeed, his dreadful extremity was\r\nbut too plain, for after his legs were quite consumed, he showed his\r\nbody and shirt unsinged by the flame. Crying upon God for mercy, a man\r\nwith a bill pulled the fagots down, and when the flames arose, he bent\r\nhimself towards that side; at length the gunpowder was ignited, and then\r\nhe ceased to move, burning on the other side, and falling down at Mr.\r\nLatimer's feet over the chain that had hitherto supported him.\r\n\r\nEvery eye shed tears at the afflicting sight of these sufferers, who\r\nwere among the most distinguished persons of their time in dignity,\r\npiety, and public estimation. They suffered October 16, 1555.\r\n\r\nIn the following month died Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester and\r\nLord Chancellor of England. This papistical monster was born at Bury, in\r\nSuffolk, and partly educated at Cambridge. Ambitious, cruel, and\r\nbigoted, he served any cause; be first espoused the king's part in the\r\naffair of Anne Boleyn: upon the establishment of the Reformation, he\r\ndeclared the supremacy of the Pope an execrable tenet, and when queen\r\nMary came to the crown, he entered into all her papistical bigoted\r\nviews, and became a second time bishop of Winchester. It is conjectured\r\nit was his intention to have moved the sacrifice of Lady Elizabeth, but\r\nwhen he arrived at this point, it pleased God to remove him.\r\n\r\nIt was on the afternoon of the day when those faithful soldiers of\r\nChrist, Ridley and Latimer, perished, that Gardiner sat down with a\r\njoyful heart to dinner. Scarcely had he taken a few mouthfuls, when he\r\nwas seized with illness, and carried to his bed, where he lingered\r\nfifteen days in great torment, unable in any wise to evacuate, and burnt\r\nwith a devouring fever, that terminated in death. Execrated by all good\r\nChristians, we pray the Father of Mercies, that he may receive that\r\nmercy above he never imparted below.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Webb, George Roper, and Gregory Parker._\r\n\r\nThese martyrs, after being brought before the bishop of Dover and Dr.\r\nHarpsfield, were finally examined, October 3, 1555, adjudged to be\r\nheretics, and at Canterbury, terminated their existence.\r\n\r\nWm. Wiseman, clothworker of London, died in Lollard's Tower, Dec. 13,\r\n1555, not without suspicion of being made way with, for his love of the\r\ngospel. In December, died James Gore, at Colchester, imprisoned for the\r\nsame cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Philpot._\r\n\r\nThis martyr was the son of a knight, born in Hampshire, and brought up\r\nat New College, Oxford, where he several years studied the civil law,\r\nand became eminent in the Hebrew tongue. He was a scholar and a\r\ngentleman, zealous in religion, fearless in disposition, and a detester\r\nof flattery. After visiting Italy, he returned to England, affairs in\r\nKing Edward's days wearing a more promising aspect. During this reign he\r\ncontinued to be archdeacon of Winchester under Dr. Poinet, who succeeded\r\nGardiner. Upon the accession of Mary, a convocation was summoned, in\r\nwhich Mr. Philpot defended the Reformation against his ordinary,\r\nGardiner, (again made bishop of Winchester,) and soon was conducted to\r\nBonner and other commissioners for examination, Oct. 2, 1555, after\r\nbeing eighteen months imprisoned. Upon his demanding to see the\r\ncommission, Dr. Story cruelly observed, \"I will spend both my gown and\r\nmy coat, but I will burn thee! Let him be in Lollard's tower, (a\r\nwretched prison,) for I will sweep the King's Bench and all other\r\nprisons of these heretics!\" Upon Mr. Philpot's second examination, it\r\nwas intimated to him, that Dr. Story had said that the Lord Chancellor\r\nhad commanded that he should be made way with. It is easy to foretell\r\nthe result of this inquiry; he was committed to Bonner's coal-house,\r\nwhere he joined company with a zealous minister of Essex, who had been\r\ninduced to sign a bill of recantation; but afterward, stung by his\r\nconscience, he asked the bishop to let him see the instrument again,\r\nwhen he tore it to pieces; which induced Bonner in a fury to strike him\r\nrepeatedly, and tear away part of his beard. Mr. Philpot had a private\r\ninterview with Bonner the same night, and was then remanded to his bed\r\nof straw like other prisoners, in the coal-house. After seven\r\nexaminations, Bonner ordered him to be set in the stocks, and on the\r\nfollowing Sunday separated him from his fellow-prisoners as a sower of\r\nheresy, and ordered him up to a room near the battlements of St. Paul's,\r\neight feet by thirteen, on the other side of Lollard's tower, and which\r\ncould be overlooked by any one in the bishop's outer gallery. Here Mr.\r\nPhilpot was searched, but happily he was successful in secreting some\r\nletters containing his examinations. In the eleventh investigation\r\nbefore various bishops, and Mr. Morgan, of Oxford, the latter was so\r\ndriven into a corner by the close pressure of Mr. Philpot's arguments,\r\nthat he said to him, \"Instead of the spirit of the gospel which you\r\nboast to possess, I think it is the spirit of the buttery, which your\r\nfellows have had, who were drunk before their death, and went I believe\r\ndrunken to it.\" To this unfounded and brutish remark, Mr. Philpot\r\nindignantly replied, \"It appeareth by your communication, that you are\r\nbetter acquainted with that spirit than the spirit of God; wherefore I\r\ntell thee, thou painted wall and hypocrite, in the name of the living\r\nGod, whose truth I have told thee, that God shall rain fire and\r\nbrimstone upon such blasphemers as thou art!\" He was then remanded by\r\nBonner, with an order not to allow him his Bible nor candlelight.\r\nDecember 4th, Mr. Philpot had his next hearing, and this was followed by\r\ntwo more, making in all, fourteen conferences, previous to the final\r\nexamination in which he was condemned; such were the perseverance and\r\nanxiety of the Catholics, aided by the argumentative abilities of the\r\nmost distinguished of the papal bishops, to bring him into the pale of\r\ntheir church. Those examinations, which were very long and learned, were\r\nall written down by Mr. Philpot, and a stronger proof of the imbecility\r\nof the Catholic doctors, cannot, to an unbiassed mind, be exhibited.\r\nDecember 16th, in the consistory of St. Paul's bishop Bonner, after\r\nlaying some trifling accusations to his charge such as secreting powder\r\nto make ink, writing some private letters, &c. proceeded to pass the\r\nawful sentence upon him, after he and the other bishops had urged him by\r\nevery inducement to recant. He was afterward conducted to Newgate, where\r\nthe avaricious Catholic keeper loaded him with heavy irons, which by the\r\nhumanity of Mr. Macham were ordered to be taken off. December 17th, Mr.\r\nPhilpot received intimation that he was to die next day, and the next\r\nmorning about eight o'clock, he joyfully met the sheriffs, who were to\r\nattend him to the place of execution. Upon entering Smithfield the\r\nground was so muddy, that two officers offered to carry him to the\r\nstake, but he replied, \"Would you make me a pope? I am content to finish\r\nmy journey on foot.\" Arrived at the stake, he said, \"Shall I disdain to\r\nsuffer at the stake, when my Redeemer did not refuse to suffer the most\r\nvile death upon the Cross for me?\" He then meekly recited the cvii. and\r\ncviii. Psalms, and when he had finished his prayers, was bound to the\r\npost, and fire applied to the pile. On December 18th, 1555, perished\r\nthis illustrious martyr, reverenced by man, and glorified in heaven! His\r\nletters arising out of the cause for which he suffered, are elegant,\r\nnumerous, and elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rev. T. Whittle, B. Green, T. Brown, J. Tudson, J. Ent, Isabel Tooster,\r\nand Joan Lashford._\r\n\r\nThese seven persons were summoned before Bonner's consistory, and the\r\narticles of the Romish church tendered for their approbation. Their\r\nrefusal subjected them to the sentence of condemnation, and on January\r\n27, 1556, they underwent the dreadful sentence of blood in Smithfield.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartlet Green was condemned the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Brown, born at Histon, Ely, but afterward of St. Bride's,\r\nLondon, was presented by the parish constable to Bonner, for absenting\r\nhimself from church. This faithful soldier of Christ suffered on the\r\nsame day with the preceding.\r\n\r\nMr. John Tudson, of Ipswich by birth, was apprenticed in London to a Mr.\r\nGoodyear, of St. Mary Botolph. He was condemned January 15, 1556, and\r\nconsigned to the secular power, which completed the fiery tyranny of the\r\nlaw, January 27, to the glory of God, and the immortal salvation of the\r\nmeek sufferer.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, John Hunt, Isabella Forster, and Joan Warne, were\r\ncondemned and executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Lomas, Agnes Snoth, Anne Wright, Joan Sole, and Joan Catmer._\r\n\r\nThese five martyrs suffered together, January 31, 1556. John Lomas was a\r\nyoung man of Tenterden. He was cited to appear at Canterbury, and was\r\nexamined January 17. His answers being adverse to the idolatrous\r\ndoctrine of the papacy, he was condemned on the following day, and\r\nsuffered January 31.\r\n\r\nAgnes Snoth, widow, of Smarden Parish, was several times summoned before\r\nthe Catholic Pharisees, and rejecting absolution, indulgences,\r\ntransubstantiation, and auricular confession, she was adjudged worthy to\r\nsuffer death, and endured martyrdom, January 31, with Anne Wright and\r\nJoan Sole, who were placed in similar circumstances, and perished at the\r\nsame time, with equal resignation. Joan Catmer, the last of this\r\nheavenly company, of the parish Hithe, was the wife of the martyr George\r\nCatmer.\r\n\r\nSeldom in any country, for political controversy, have four women been\r\nled to execution, whose lives were irreproachable, and whom the pity of\r\nsavages would have spared. We cannot but remark here that, when the\r\nProtestant power first gained the ascendency over the Catholic\r\nsuperstition, and some degree of force in the laws was necessary to\r\nenforce uniformity, whence some bigoted people suffered privation in\r\ntheir person or goods, we read of few burnings, savage cruelties, or\r\npoor women brought to the stake, but it is the nature of error to resort\r\nto force instead of argument, and to silence truth by taking away\r\nexistence, of which the Redeemer himself is an instance. The above five\r\npersons were burnt at two stakes in one fire, singing hosannahs to the\r\nglorified Saviour, till the breath of life was extinct. Sir John Norton,\r\nwho was present, wept bitterly at their unmerited sufferings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Archbishop Cranmer._\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Cranmer was descended from an ancient family, and was born at\r\nthe village of Arselacton, in the county of Northampton. After the usual\r\nschool education he was sent to Cambridge, and was chosen fellow of\r\nJesus College. Here he married a gentleman's daughter, by which he\r\nforfeited his fellowship, and became a reader in Buckingham college,\r\nplacing his wife at the Dolphin inn, the landlady of which was a\r\nrelation of hers, whence arose the idle report that he was an ostler.\r\nHis lady shortly after dying in childbed, to his credit he was re-chosen\r\na fellow of the college before mentioned. In a few years after, he was\r\npromoted to be Divinity Lecturer, and appointed one of the examiners\r\nover those who were ripe to become Bachelors or Doctors in Divinity. It\r\nwas his principle to judge of their qualifications by the knowledge they\r\npossessed of the Scriptures, rather than of the ancient fathers, and\r\nhence many popish priests were rejected, and others rendered much\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nHe was strongly solicited by Dr. Capon to be one of the fellows on the\r\nfoundation of Cardinal Wolsey's college, Oxford, of which he hazarded\r\nthe refusal. While he continued in Cambridge, the question of Henry\r\nVIII.'s divorce with Catharine was agitated. At that time, on account of\r\nthe plague, Dr. Cranmer removed to the house of a Mr. Cressy, at Waltham\r\nAbbey, whose two sons were then educating under him. The affair of\r\ndivorce, contrary to the king's approbation, had remained undecided\r\nabove two or three years, from the intrigues of the canonists and\r\ncivilians, and though the cardinals Campeius and Wolsey were\r\ncommissioned from Rome to decide the question, they purposely protracted\r\nthe sentence. It happened that Dr. Gardiner (secretary) and Dr. Fox,\r\ndefenders of the king in the above suit, came to the house of Mr. Cressy\r\nto lodge, while the king removed to Greenwich. At supper, a conversation\r\nensued with Dr. Cranmer, who suggested that the question, whether a man\r\nmay marry his brother's wife or not, could be easily and speedily\r\ndecided by the word of God, and this as well in the English courts as\r\nin those of any foreign nation. The king, uneasy at the delay, sent for\r\nDr. Gardiner and Dr. Foxe, to consult them, regretting that a new\r\ncommission must be sent to Rome, and the suit be endlessly protracted.\r\nUpon relating to the king the conversation which had passed on the\r\nprevious evening with Dr. Cranmer, his majesty sent for him, and opened\r\nthe tenderness of conscience upon the near affinity of the queen. Dr.\r\nCranmer advised that the matter should be referred to the most learned\r\ndivines of Cambridge and Oxford, as he was unwilling to meddle in an\r\naffair of such weight; but the king enjoined him to deliver his\r\nsentiments in writing, and to repair for that purpose to the Earl of\r\nWiltshire's, who would accommodate him with books, and every thing\r\nrequisite for the occasion. This Dr. Cranmer immediately did, and in his\r\ndeclaration, not only quoted the authority of the Scriptures, of general\r\ncouncils and the ancient writers, but maintained that the bishop of Rome\r\nhad no authority whatever to dispense with the word of God. The king\r\nasked him if he would stand by this bold declaration; to which replying\r\nin the affirmative, he was deputed ambassador to Rome, in conjunction\r\nwith the Earl of Wiltshire, Dr. Stokesley, Dr. Carne, Dr. Bennet, and\r\nothers, previous to which, the marriage was discussed in most of the\r\nuniversities of Christendom and at Rome; when the pope presented his toe\r\nto be kissed, as customary, the Earl of Wiltshire and his party refused.\r\nIndeed, it is affirmed, that a spaniel of the Earl's, attracted by the\r\nglitter of the pope's toe, made a snap at it, whence his holiness drew\r\nin his sacred foot, and kicked at the offender with the other. Upon the\r\npope demanding the cause of their embassy, the Earl presented Dr.\r\nCranmer's book, declaring that his learned friends had come to defend\r\nit. The pope treated the embassy honourably, and appointed a day for the\r\ndiscussion, which he delayed, as if afraid of the issue of the\r\ninvestigation. The Earl returned, and Dr. Cranmer, by the king's desire,\r\nvisited the emperor, and was successful in bringing him over to his\r\nopinion. Upon the Doctor's return to England, Dr. Warham, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, having quitted this transitory life, Dr. Cranmer was\r\ndeservedly, and by Dr. Warham's desire, elevated to that eminent\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nIn this function, it may be said that he followed closely the charge of\r\nSt. Paul. Diligent in duty, he rose at five in the morning, and\r\ncontinued in study and prayer till nine: between then and dinner, he\r\ndevoted to temporal affairs. After dinner, if any suitors wanted\r\nhearing, he would determine their business with such an affability, that\r\neven the defaulters were scarcely displeased. Then he would play at\r\nchess for an hour, or see others play, and at five o'clock he heard the\r\nCommon Prayer read, and from this till supper he took the recreation of\r\nwalking. At supper his conversation was lively and entertaining; again\r\nhe walked or amused himself till nine o'clock, and then entered his\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nHe ranked high in favour with king Henry and ever had the purity and the\r\ninterest of the English church deeply at heart. His mild and forgiving\r\ndisposition is recorded in the following instance--An ignorant priest,\r\nin the country, had called Cranmer an ostler, and spoken very derogatory\r\nof his learning. Lord Cromwell receiving information of it, the man was\r\nsent to the fleet, and his case was told to the archbishop by a Mr.\r\nChertsey, a grocer, and a relation of the priest's. His grace, having\r\nsent for the offender, reasoned with him, and solicited the priest to\r\nquestion him on any learned subject. This the man, overcome by the\r\nbishop's good nature, and knowing his own glaring incapacity, declined,\r\nand entreated his forgiveness, which was immediately granted, with a\r\ncharge to employ his time better when he returned to his parish.\r\nCromwell was much vexed at the lenity displayed, but the bishop was ever\r\nmore ready to receive injury than to retaliate in any other manner than\r\nby good advice and good offices.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Cranmer was raised to be archbishop, he was king's\r\nchaplain, and archdeacon of Taunton; he was also constituted by the\r\npope, penitentiary general of England. It was considered by the king\r\nthat Cranmer would be obsequious; hence the latter married the king to\r\nAnne Boleyn, performed her coronation, stood godfather to Elizabeth, the\r\nfirst child, and divorced the king from Catharine. Though Cranmer\r\nreceived a confirmation of his dignity from the pope, he always\r\nprotested against acknowledging any other authority than the king's, and\r\nhe persisted in the same independent sentiments when before Mary's\r\ncommissioners in 1555. One of the first steps after the divorce was to\r\nprevent preaching throughout his diocess, but this narrow measure had\r\nrather a political view than a religious one, as there were many who\r\ninveighed against the king's conduct. In his new dignity Cranmer\r\nagitated the question of supremacy, and by his powerful and just\r\narguments induced the parliament to \"render to Caesar the things which\r\nare Caesar's.\" During Cranmer's residence in Germany, 1531, he became\r\nacquainted with Ossiander, at Nurenburgh, and married his niece, but\r\nleft her with him while on his return to England; after a season he sent\r\nfor her privately, and she remained with him till the year 1539, when\r\nthe Six Articles compelled him to return her to her friends for a time.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that Ossiander, having obtained the approbation\r\nof his friend Cranmer, published the laborious work of the Harmony of\r\nthe Gospels in 1537. In 1534 the archbishop completed the dearest wish\r\nof his heart, the removal of every obstacle to the perfection of the\r\nReformation, by the subscription of the nobles and bishops to the king's\r\nsole supremacy. Only bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More made objection;\r\nand their agreement not to oppose the succession, Cranmer was willing to\r\nconsider as sufficient, but the monarch would have no other than an\r\nentire concession. Not long after, Gardiner, in a private interview with\r\nthe king, spoke inimically of Cranmer, (whom he maliciously hated) for\r\nassuming the title of Primate of all England, as derogatory to the\r\nsupremacy of the king, this created much jealousy against Cranmer, and\r\nhis translation of the Bible was strongly opposed by Stokesley, bishop\r\nof London. It is said, upon the demise of queen Catharine, that her\r\nsuccessor Anne Boleyn rejoiced--a lesson this to show how shallow is the\r\nhuman judgment! since her own execution took place in the spring of the\r\nfollowing year, and the king, on the day following the beheading of this\r\nsacrificed lady, married the beautiful Jane Seymour, a maid of honour to\r\nthe late queen. Cranmer was ever the friend of Anne Boleyn, but it was\r\ndangerous to oppose the will of the carnal tyrannical monarch.\r\n\r\nIn 1538, the holy Scriptures were openly exposed to sale; and the places\r\nof worship overflowed every where to hear its holy doctrines expounded.\r\nUpon the king's passing into a law the famous Six Articles, which went\r\nnearly again to establish the essential tenets of the Romish creed,\r\nCranmer shone forth with all the lustre of a Christian patriot, in\r\nresisting the doctrines they contained, and in which he was supported by\r\nthe bishops of Sarum, Worcester, Ely, and Rochester, the two former of\r\nwhom resigned their bishoprics. The king, though now in opposition to\r\nCranmer, still revered the sincerity that marked his conduct. The death\r\nof Lord Cromwell in the Tower, in 1540, the good friend of Cranmer, was\r\na severe blow to the wavering protestant cause, but even now Cranmer,\r\nwhen he saw the tide directly adverse to the truth, boldly waited on the\r\nking in person, and by his manly and heartfelt pleading, caused the book\r\nof Articles to be passed on his side, to the great confusion of his\r\nenemies, who had contemplated his fall as inevitable.\r\n\r\nCranmer now lived in as secluded a manner as possible, till the rancour\r\nof Winchester preferred some articles against him, relative to the\r\ndangerous opinion he taught in his family, joined to other treasonable\r\ncharges. These the king delivered himself to Cranmer, and believing\r\nfirmly the fidelity and assertions of innocence of the accused prelate,\r\nhe caused the matter to be deeply investigated, and Winchester and Dr.\r\nLenden, with Thornton and Barber, of the bishop's household, were found\r\nby the papers to be the real conspirators. The mild forgiving Cranmer\r\nwould have interceded for all remission of punishment, had not Henry,\r\npleased with the subsidy voted by parliament, let them be discharged;\r\nthese nefarious men, however, again renewing their plots against\r\nCranmer, fell victims to Henry's resentment, and Gardiner forever lost\r\nhis confidence. Sir G. Gostwick soon after laid charges against the\r\narchbishop, which Henry quashed, and the primate was willing to forgive.\r\n\r\nIn 1544, the archbishop's palace at Canterbury was burnt, and his\r\nbrother-in-law with others perished in it. These various afflictions may\r\nserve to reconcile us to an humble state; for of what happiness could\r\nthis great and good man boast? since his life was constantly harassed\r\neither by political, religious, or natural crosses. Again the inveterate\r\nGardiner laid high charges against the meek archbishop and would have\r\nsent him to the tower; but the king was his friend, gave him his signet\r\nthat he would defend him, and in the council not only declared the\r\nbishop one of the best affected men in his realm, but sharply rebuked\r\nhis accusers for their calumny.\r\n\r\nA peace having been made, Henry, and the French king Henry the Great,\r\nwere unanimous to have the mass abolished in their kingdom, and Cranmer\r\nset about this great work; but the death of the English monarch, in\r\n1546, suspended the procedure, and king Edward his successor continued\r\nCranmer in the same functions, upon whose coronation he delivered a\r\ncharge that will ever honour his memory, for its purity, freedom, and\r\ntruth. During this reign he prosecuted the glorious reformation with\r\nunabated zeal, even in the year 1552, when he was seized with a severe\r\nague, from which it pleased God to restore him that he might testify by\r\nhis death the truth of that seed he had diligently sown.\r\n\r\nThe death of Edward, in 1553, exposed Cranmer to all the rage of his\r\nenemies. Though the archbishop was among those who supported Mary's\r\naccession, he was attainted at the meeting of parliament, and in\r\nNovember adjudged guilty of high treason at Guildhall, and degraded from\r\nhis dignities. He sent an humble letter to Mary, explaining the cause of\r\nhis signing the will in favor of Edward, and in 1554 he wrote to the\r\ncouncil, whom he pressed to obtain a pardon from the queen, by a letter\r\ndelivered to Dr. Weston, but which the latter opened, and on seeing its\r\ncontents, basely returned. Treason was a charge quite inapplicable to\r\nCranmer, who supported the queen's right; while others, who had favoured\r\nLady Jane, upon paying a small fine were dismissed. A calumny was now\r\nspread against Cranmer, that he complied with some of the popish\r\nceremonies to ingratiate himself with the queen, which he dared publicly\r\nto disavow, and justified his articles of faith. The active part which\r\nthe prelate had taken in the divorce of Mary's mother had ever rankled\r\ndeeply in the heart of the queen, and revenge formed a prominent feature\r\nin the death of Cranmer. We have in this work, noticed the public\r\ndisputations at Oxford, in which the talents of Cranmer, Ridley, and\r\nLatimer, shone so conspicuously, and tended to their condemnation.--The\r\nfirst sentence was illegal, inasmuch as the usurped power of the pope\r\nhad not yet been re-established by law. Being kept in prison till this\r\nwas effected, a commission was despatched from Rome, appointing Dr.\r\nBrooks to sit as the representative of his Holiness, and Drs. Story and\r\nMartin as those of the queen. Cranmer was willing to bow to the\r\nauthority of Drs. Story and Martin, but against that of Dr. Brooks he\r\nprotested. Such were the remarks and replies of Cranmer, after a long\r\nexamination, that Dr. Brooks observed, \"We come to examine you, and\r\nmethinks you examine us.\" Being sent back to confinement, he received a\r\ncitation to appear at Rome within eighteen days, but this was\r\nimpracticable, as he was imprisoned in England; and as he stated, even\r\nhad he been at liberty, he was too poor to employ an advocate. Absurd as\r\nit must appear, Cranmer was condemned at Rome, and February 14, 1556, a\r\nnew commission was appointed by which, Thirdly, bishop of Ely, and\r\nBonner, of London, were deputed to sit in judgment at Christ-church,\r\nOxford. By virtue of this instrument, Cranmer was gradually degraded, by\r\nputting mere rags on him to represent the dress of an archbishop; then\r\nstripping him of his attire, they took off his own gown, and put an old\r\nworn one upon him instead. This he bore unmoved, and his enemies,\r\nfinding that severity only rendered him more determined, tried the\r\nopposite course, and placed him in the house of the dean of\r\nChrist-church, where he was treated with every indulgence. This\r\npresented such a contrast to the three years hard imprisonment he had\r\nreceived, that it threw him off his guard. His open, generous nature was\r\nmore easily to be seduced by a liberal conduct than by threats and\r\nfetters. When satan finds the christian proof against one mode of\r\nattack, he tries another; and what form is so seductive as smiles,\r\nrewards, and power, after a long, painful imprisonment? Thus it was with\r\nCranmer: his enemies promised him his former greatness if he would but\r\nrecant, as well as the queen's favour, and this at the very time they\r\nknew that his death was determined in council. To soften the path to\r\napostacy, the first paper brought for his signature was conceived in\r\ngeneral terms; this one signed, five others were obtained as explanatory\r\nof the first, till finally he put his hand to the following detestable\r\ninstrument:--\r\n\r\n\"I, Thomas Cranmer, late archbishop of Canterbury, do renounce, abhor,\r\nand detest all manner of heresies and errors of Luther and Zuinglius,\r\nand all other teachings which are contrary to sound and true doctrine.\r\nAnd I believe most constantly in my heart, and with my mouth I confess\r\none holy and catholic church visible, without which there is no\r\nsalvation; and therefore I acknowledge the bishop of Rome to be supreme\r\nhead on earth, whom I acknowledge to be the highest bishop and pope, and\r\nChrist's vicar, unto whom all christian people ought to be subject.\r\n\r\n\"And as concerning the sacraments, I believe and worship in the\r\nsacrament of the altar the body and blood of Christ, being contained\r\nmost truly under the forms of bread and wine; the bread, through the\r\nmighty power of God being turned into the body of our Saviour Jesus\r\nChrist, and the wine into his blood.\r\n\r\n\"And in the other six sacraments, also, (alike as in this) I believe and\r\nhold as the universal church holdeth, and the church of Rome judgeth and\r\ndetermineth.\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, I believe that there is a place of purgatory, where souls\r\ndeparted be punished for a time, for whom the church doth godlily and\r\nwholesomely pray, like as it doth honour saints and make prayers to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, in all things I profess, that I do not otherwise believe than\r\nthe catholic church and the church of Rome holdeth and teacheth.--I am\r\nsorry that I ever held or thought otherwise. And I beseech Almighty God,\r\nthat of his mercy he will vouchsafe to forgive me whatsoever I have\r\noffended against God or his church, and also I desire and beseech all\r\nchristian people to pray for me.\r\n\r\n\"And all such as have been deceived either by mine example of doctrine,\r\nI require them by the blood of Jesus Christ that they will return to the\r\nunity of the church, that we may be all of one mind, without schism or\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n\"And to conclude, as I submit myself to the catholic church of Christ,\r\nand to the supreme head thereof, so I submit myself unto the most\r\nexcellent majesties of Philip and Mary, king and queen of this realm of\r\nEngland, &c. and to all other their laws and ordinances, being ready\r\nalways as a faithful subject ever to obey them. And God is my witness,\r\nthat I have not done this for favour or fear of any person, but\r\nwillingly and of mine own conscience, as to the instruction of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall!\" said the apostle, and\r\nhere was a falling off indeed! The papists now triumphed in their turn:\r\nthey had acquired all they wanted short of his life. His recantation was\r\nimmediately printed and dispersed, that it might have its due effect\r\nupon the astonished protestants; but God counter-worked all the designs\r\nof the catholics by the extent to which they carried the implacable\r\npersecution of their prey. Doubtless, the love of life induced Cranmer\r\nto sign the above declaration; yet death may be said to have been\r\npreferable to life to him who lay under the stings of a goaded\r\nconscience and the contempt of every gospel christian; this principle he\r\nstrongly felt in all its force and anguish.\r\n\r\nThe queen's revenge was only to be satiated in Cranmer's blood, and\r\ntherefore she wrote an order to Dr. Cole, to prepare a sermon to be\r\npreached March 21, directly before his martyrdom, at St. Mary's, Oxford;\r\nDr. Cole visited him the day previous, and was induced to believe that\r\nhe would publicly deliver his sentiments in confirmation of the articles\r\nto which he had subscribed. About nine in the morning of the day of\r\nsacrifice, the queen's commissioners, attended by the magistrates,\r\nconducted the amiable unfortunate to St. Mary's church. His torn, dirty\r\ngarb, the same in which they habited him upon his degradation, excited\r\nthe commisseration of the people. In the church he found a low, mean\r\nstage, erected opposite to the pulpit, on which being placed, he turned\r\nhis face, and fervently prayed to God. The church was crowded with\r\npersons of both persuasions, expecting to hear the justification of the\r\nlate apostacy: the catholics rejoicing, and the protestants deeply\r\nwounded in spirit at the deceit of the human heart. Dr. Cole, in his\r\nsermon, represented Cranmer as having been guilty of the most atrocious\r\ncrimes; encouraged the deluded sufferer not to fear death, not to doubt\r\nthe support of God in his torments, nor that masses would be said in all\r\nthe churches of Oxford for the repose of his soul. The Doctor then\r\nnoticed his conversion, and which he ascribed to the evident working of\r\nAlmighty Power, and in order that the people might be convinced of its\r\nreality, asked the prisoner to give them a sign. This Cranmer did, and\r\nbegged the congregation to pray for him, for he had committed many and\r\ngrievous sins; but, of all, there was one which awfully lay upon his\r\nmind, of which he would speak shortly.\r\n\r\nDuring the sermon Cranmer wept bitter tears: lifting up his hands and\r\neyes to heaven, and letting them fall, as if unworthy to live: his grief\r\nnow found vent in words: before his confession he fell upon his knees,\r\nand, in the following words unveiled the deep contrition and agitation\r\nwhich harrowed up his soul.\r\n\r\n\"O Father of heaven! O Son of God, Redeemer of the world! O Holy Ghost,\r\nthree persons and one God! have mercy on me, most wretched caitiff and\r\nmiserable sinner. I have offended both against heaven and earth, more\r\nthan my tongue can express. Whither then may I go, or whither may I\r\nflee? To heaven I may be ashamed to lift up mine eyes, and in earth I\r\nfind no place of refuge or succour. To thee, therefore, O Lord, do I\r\nrun; to thee do I humble myself, saying, O Lord, my God, my sins be\r\ngreat, but yet have mercy upon me for thy great mercy. The great mystery\r\nthat God became man, was not wrought for little or few offences. Thou\r\ndidst not give thy Son, O Heavenly Father, unto death for small sins\r\nonly, but for all the greatest sins of the world, so that the sinner\r\nreturn to thee with his whole heart, as I do at present. Wherefore, have\r\nmercy on me, O God, whose property is always to have mercy, have mercy\r\nupon me, O Lord, for thy great mercy. I crave nothing for my own merits,\r\nbut for thy name's sake, that it may be hallowed thereby, and for thy\r\ndear Son Jesus Christ's sake. And now therefore, O Father of Heaven,\r\nhallowed be thy name,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThen rising, he said he was desirous before his death to give them some\r\npious exhortations by which God might be glorified and themselves\r\nedified. He then descanted upon the danger of a love for the world, the\r\nduty of obedience to their majesties of love to one another and the\r\nnecessity of the rich administering to the wants of the poor. He quoted\r\nthe three verses of the fifth chapter of James, and then proceeded, \"Let\r\nthem that be rich ponder well these three sentences: for if they ever\r\nhad occasion to show their charity, they have it now at this present,\r\nthe poor people being so many, and victual so dear.\r\n\r\n\"And now forasmuch as I am come to the last end of my life, whereupon\r\nhangeth all my life past, and all my life to come, either to live with\r\nmy master Christ for ever in joy, or else to be in pain for ever with\r\nthe wicked in hell, and I see before mine eyes presently, either heaven\r\nready to receive me, or else hell ready to swallow me up; I shall\r\ntherefore declare unto you my very faith how I believe, without any\r\ncolour of dissimulation: for now is no time to dissemble, whatsoever I\r\nhave said or written in times past.\r\n\r\n\"First, I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth,\r\n&c. And I believe every article of the Catholic faith, every word and\r\nsentence taught by our Saviour Jesus Christ, his apostles and prophets,\r\nin the New and Old Testament.\r\n\r\n\"And now I come to the great thing which so much troubleth my\r\nconscience, more than any thing that ever I did or said in my whole\r\nlife, and that is the setting abroad of a writing contrary to the truth,\r\nwhich now here I renounce and refuse, as things written with my hand\r\ncontrary to the truth which I thought in my heart, and written for fear\r\nof death, and to save my life, if it might be; and that is, all such\r\nbills or papers which I have written or signed with my hand since my\r\ndegradation, wherein I have written many things untrue. And forasmuch as\r\nmy hand hath offended, writing contrary to my heart, therefore my hand\r\nshall first be punished; for when I come to the fire, it shall first be\r\nburned.\r\n\r\n\"And as for the Pope, I refuse him as Christ's enemy, and antichrist,\r\nwith all his false doctrine.\r\n\r\n\"And as for the sacrament, I believe as I have taught in my book against\r\nthe bishop of Winchester, which my book teacheth so true a doctrine of\r\nthe sacrament, that it shall stand in the last day before the judgment\r\nof God, where the papistical doctrines contrary thereto shall be ashamed\r\nto show their face.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the conclusion of this unexpected declaration, amazement and\r\nindignation were conspicuous in every part of the church. The catholics\r\nwere completely foiled, their object being frustrated; Cranmer, like\r\nSampson, having completed a greater ruin upon his enemies in the hour of\r\ndeath, than he did in his life.\r\n\r\nCranmer would have proceeded in the exposure of the popish doctrines,\r\nbut the murmurs of the idolaters drowned his voice, and the preacher\r\ngave an order to lead the heretic away! The savage command was directly\r\nobeyed, and the lamb about to suffer was torn from his stand to the\r\nplace of slaughter, insulted all the way by the revilings and taunts of\r\nthe pestilent monks and friars. With thoughts intent upon a far higher\r\nobject than the empty threats of man, he reached the spot dyed with the\r\nblood of Ridley and Latimer. There he knelt for a short time in earnest\r\ndevotion, and then arose, that he might undress and prepare for the\r\nfire. Two friars who had been parties in prevailing upon him to abjure,\r\nnow endeavoured to draw him off again from the truth, but he was\r\nsteadfast and immoveable in what he had just professed, and before\r\npublicly taught. A chain was provided to bind him to the stake, and\r\nafter it had tightly encircled him, fire was put to the fuel, and the\r\nflames began soon to ascend. Then were the glorious sentiments of the\r\nmartyr made manifest;--then it was, that stretching out his right hand,\r\nhe held it unshrinkingly in the fire till it was burnt to a cinder, even\r\nbefore his body was injured, frequently exclaiming, \"This unworthy right\r\nhand!\" Apparently insensible of pain, with a countenance of venerable\r\nresignation, and eyes directed to Him for whose cause he suffered, he\r\ncontinued, like St. Stephen, to say, \"Lord Jesus receive my spirit!\"\r\ntill the fury of the flames terminated his powers of utterance and\r\nexistence. He closed a life of high sublunary elevation, of constant\r\nuneasiness, and of glorious martyrdom, on March 21, 1556.\r\n\r\nThus perished the illustrious Cranmer, the man whom king Henry's\r\ncapricious soul esteemed for his virtues above all other men. Cranmer's\r\nexample is an endless testimony that fraud and cruelty are the leading\r\ncharacteristics of the catholic hierarchy. They first seduced him to\r\nlive by recantation, and then doomed him to perish, using perhaps the\r\nsophistical arguments, that, being brought again within the catholic\r\npale, he was then most fit to die. His gradual change from darkness to\r\nthe light of the truth, proved that he had a mind open to conviction.\r\nThough mild and forgiving in temper, he was severe in church discipline,\r\nand it is only on this ground that one act of cruelty of his can in any\r\nway be excused. A poor woman was in Edward's reign condemned to be burnt\r\nfor her religious opinions; the pious young monarch reasoned with the\r\narchbishop upon the impropriety of protestants resorting to the same\r\ncruel means they censured in papists, adding humanely, \"What! would you\r\nhave me send her quick to the devil in her error?\" The prelate however\r\nwas not to be softened, and the king signed the death warrant with eyes\r\nsteeped in tears. There is however a shade in the greatest characters,\r\nand few characters, whether political or religious, were greater than\r\nCranmer's.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agnes Potten and Joan Trunchfield._\r\n\r\nThese godly women (before mentioned) were both of Ipswich, and suffered\r\nabout the same time with Cranmer. When in prison together, Mrs.\r\nTrunchfield was less ardent and zealous than Mrs. Potten; but when at\r\nthe stake, her hope in glory was brighter even than that of her\r\nfellow-sufferer.\r\n\r\nJohn Maundrel, William Coberly, and John Spicer were burnt between\r\nSalisbury and Wilton, March 24, 1556. Two died without any particular\r\nretardation, but Coberly, from the current of wind as he stood, was a\r\nlong time in perishing. His left arm was visible to the bone, while the\r\nright, but little injured, beat upon his breast softly, and the\r\ndischarge from his mouth was considerable. Rising suddenly erect from\r\nhanging over the chain, as if dead, he gave up his mortal abode for one\r\nmade without hands, eternal in the heavens!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rev. Robert Drakes, Rev. William Tyms, Richard Spurge, Sheerman T.\r\nSpurge, Fuller; J. Cavel, Weaver; and G. Ambrose, Fuller._\r\n\r\nThese worthies were of Essex, and in the diocese of London.--They were\r\nall sent up to Gardiner, the chancellor, March 25, 1555; who imprisoned\r\nthem some in the king's bench, and others in the Marshalsea.\r\n\r\nMarch 28, the six were brought up for condemnation in the consistory of\r\nSt. Paul's; after which sentence, they were delivered to the sheriff, to\r\nbe sent to Newgate, where they remained, patiently waiting the Lord's\r\ntime for deliverance, which took place about the 23d of April, 1556, in\r\nSmithfield.\r\n\r\nIn the same month, perished John Harpole, of Rochester, and Joan Beach,\r\nwidow, (before mentioned) with Mr. N. Hall. They suffered under Maurice,\r\nbishop of Rochester, in whose diocess they lived.\r\n\r\nRev. John Hullier. This gentleman went from Eton school to king's\r\ncollege, Cambridge, and suffered under Dr. Thirlby, bishop of Ely. He\r\ndied the 2d of April, 1556.\r\n\r\nFrom Kent we now turn to Colchester in Essex, where six constant\r\nprofessors of the gospel were selected to witness the truth by the\r\nsacrifice of their lives. These were, C. Luyster, of Dagenham,\r\nhusbandman; John Mace, apothecary; John Spencer, weaver; Simon Joyne,\r\nlawyer; Richard Nichols, weaver, and John Hammond, tanner; five of\r\nColchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hugh Laverick and John Aprice._\r\n\r\nHere we perceive that neither the impotence of age nor the affliction of\r\nblindness, could turn aside the murdering fangs of these Babylonish\r\nmonsters. The first of these unfortunates was of the parish of Barking,\r\naged sixty-eight, a painter and a cripple. The other was blind,--dark\r\nindeed in his visual faculties, but intellectually illuminated with the\r\nradiance of the everlasting gospel of truth. Inoffensive objects like\r\nthese were informed against by some of the sons of bigotry, and dragged\r\nbefore the prelatical shark of London, where they underwent examination,\r\nand replied to the articles propounded to them, as other christian\r\nmartyrs had done before. On the 9th of May, in the consistory of St.\r\nPaul's, they were entreated to recant, and upon refusal, were sent to\r\nFulham, where Bonner, by way of a dessert after dinner, condemned them\r\nto the agonies of the fire. Being consigned to the secular officers, May\r\n15, 1556, they were taken in a cart from Newgate to Stratford-le-Bow,\r\nwhere they were fastened to the stake. When Hugh Laverick was secured by\r\nthe chain, having no farther occasion for his crutch, he threw it away\r\nsaying to his fellow-martyr, while consoling him, \"Be of good cheer my\r\nbrother; for my lord of London is our good physician; he will heal us\r\nboth shortly--thee of thy blindness, and me of my lameness.\" They sank\r\ndown in the fire, to rise to immortality!\r\n\r\nThe day after the above martyrdoms, Catharine Hut, of Bocking, widow;\r\nJoan Horns, spinster, of Billericay; Elizabeth Thackwel, spinster, of\r\nGreat Burstead; suffered death in Smithfield.\r\n\r\nThomas Dowry. We have again to record an act of unpitying cruelty,\r\nexercised on this lad, whom bishop Hooper, had confirmed in the Lord and\r\nthe knowledge of his word.\r\n\r\nHow long this poor sufferer remained in prison is uncertain. By the\r\ntestimony of one John Paylor, register of Gloucester, we learn, that\r\nwhen Dowry was brought before Dr. Williams, then chancellor of\r\nGloucester, the usual articles were presented him for subscription. From\r\nthese he dissented; and, upon the doctor's demanding of whom and where\r\nhe had learned his heresies, the youth replied, \"Indeed, Mr.\r\nChancellor, I learned from you in that very pulpit. On such a day\r\n(naming the day) you said, in preaching upon the sacrament, that it was\r\nto be exercised spiritually by faith, and not carnally and really, as\r\ntaught by the papists.\" Dr. Williams then bid him recant, as he had\r\ndone; but Dowry had not so learned his duty. \"Though you,\" said he, \"can\r\nso easily mock God, the world, and your own conscience, yet will I not\r\ndo so.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the above, the following three persons suffered at\r\nBeccles, in Suffolk, May 21, 1556. Thomas Spicer, of Winston, labourer;\r\nJohn Denny, and Edmund Poole.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preservation of George Crow and his Testament._\r\n\r\nThis poor man, of Malden, May 26, 1556, put to sea, to lade in Lent with\r\nFuller's earth, but the boat, being driven on land, filled with water,\r\nand every thing was washed out of her; Crow, however, saved his\r\nTestament, and coveted nothing else. With Crow was a man and a boy,\r\nwhose awful situation became every minute more alarming, as the boat was\r\nuseless, and they were ten miles from land, expecting the tide should in\r\na few hours set in upon them. After prayer to God, they got upon the\r\nmast, and hung there for the space of ten hours, when the poor boy,\r\novercome by cold and exhaustion, fell off, and was drowned. The tide\r\nhaving abated, Crow proposed to take down the masts, and float upon\r\nthem, which they did; and at ten o'clock at night they were borne away\r\nat the mercy of the waves. On Wednesday, in the night, Crow's companion\r\ndied through fatigue and hunger, and he was left alone, calling upon God\r\nfor succour. At length he was picked up by a Captain Morse, bound to\r\nAntwerp, who had nearly steered away, taking him for some fisherman's\r\nbuoy floating in the sea. As soon as Crow was got on board, he put his\r\nhand in his bosom, and drew out his Testament, which indeed was wet, but\r\nno otherwise injured. At Antwerp he was well received, and the money he\r\nhad lost was more than made good to him.\r\n\r\nJune 6, 1556, the following four martyrs suffered at Lewes, in Sussex:\r\nJ. Harland, of Woodmancote, carpenter; John Oswald, of the same place,\r\nhusbandmen; Thomas Avington, of Ardingly, turner; and Thomas Read.\r\n\r\nJune 20, at the same place, were burnt the Rev. Thomas Whood, and Thomas\r\nMills. June 24, the Rev. Wm. Alderhall; and June 28, John Clement,\r\nwheelright, died in the King's Bench prison, and were buried on the\r\ndunghill in the backyard. June 21, a young man, the servant of a\r\nmerchant, was burnt at Leicester.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Executions at Stratford-le-Bow._\r\n\r\nAt this sacrifice, which we are about to detail, no less than thirteen\r\nwere doomed to the fire.\r\n\r\nEach one refusing to subscribe contrary to conscience, they were\r\ncondemned, and the 27th of June, 1556, was appointed for their\r\nexecution at Stratford-le-Bow. Their constancy and faith glorified\r\ntheir Redeemer, equally in life and in death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_R. Bernard, A. Foster, and R. Lawson._\r\n\r\nThe first was a labourer, and a single man, of Framsden, Suffolk. He was\r\na shrewd, undaunted professor, and fearlessly replied to the bishop's\r\nquestions. Adam Foster was a husbandman, married, aged 26, of\r\nMendlesham, Suffolk. Refusing to go to church, he was sent by Sir J.\r\nTyrrel to Eye-Dungeon, and thence to bishop Hopton, who condemned him.\r\n\r\nR. Lawson, of Bury, linen-weaver, a single man, aged 30, was sent to\r\nEye-Dungeon, and after that to Bury, where they suffered in the same\r\nfire, praising God, and encouraging others to martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rev. Julius Palmer._\r\n\r\nThis gentleman's life presents a singular instance of error and\r\nconversion. In the time of Edward, he was a rigid and obstinate papist,\r\nso adverse to godly and sincere preaching, that he was even despised by\r\nhis own party; that this frame of mind should be changed, and he suffer\r\npersecution and death in queen Mary's reign, are among those events of\r\nomnipotence at which we wonder and admire.\r\n\r\nMr. Palmer was born at Coventry, where his father had been mayor. Being\r\nafterward removed to Oxford, he became, under Mr. Harley, of Magdalen\r\ncollege, an elegant Latin and Greek scholar. He was fond of useful\r\ndisputation, possessed of a lively wit, and a strong memory.\r\nIndefatigable in private study, he rose at four in the morning, and by\r\nthis practice qualified himself to become reader in logic in Magdalen\r\ncollege. The times of Edward, however, favouring the reformation, Mr.\r\nPalmer became frequently punished for his contempt of prayer and orderly\r\nbehaviour, and was at length expelled the house.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards embraced the doctrines of the reformation, which\r\noccasioned his arrest and final condemnation. He was tried on the 15th\r\nof July, 1556, together with one Thomas Askin, a fellow-prisoner. Askin\r\nand one John Guin had been sentenced the day before, and Mr. Palmer, on\r\nthe 15th, was brought up for final judgment.--Execution was ordered to\r\nfollow the sentence, and at five o'clock in the same afternoon, at a\r\nplace called the Sand-pits, these three martyrs were fastened to a\r\nstake. After devoutly praying together, they sung the 31st psalm. When\r\nthe fire was kindled, and it had seized their bodies, without an\r\nappearance of enduring pain, they continued to cry, Lord Jesus,\r\nstrengthen us! Lord Jesus receive our souls! till animation was\r\nsuspended and human suffering was past. It is remarkable, that, when\r\ntheir heads had fallen together in a mass as it were by the force of the\r\nflames, and the spectators thought Palmer was lifeless, his tongue and\r\nlips again moved, and were heard to pronounce the name of Jesus, to whom\r\nbe glory and honour forever!\r\n\r\nAbout this time, three women were burnt in the island of Guernsey, under\r\ncircumstances of aggravated cruelty, whose names were, Catherine\r\nCauches, and her two daughters, Mrs. Perotine Massey, and Guillemine\r\nGilbert.\r\n\r\nThe day of execution having arrived, three stakes were erected: the\r\nmiddle post was assigned to the mother, the eldest daughter on her right\r\nhand, and the younger on the left. They were strangled previous to\r\nburning, but the rope breaking before they were dead, the poor women\r\nfell into the fire. Perotine, at the time of her inhuman sentence, was\r\nlargely pregnant, and now, falling on her side upon the flaming fagots,\r\npresented a singular spectacle of horror!--Torn open by the tremendous\r\npangs she endured, she was delivered of a fine male child, who was\r\nrescued from its burning bed by the humanity of one W. House, who\r\ntenderly laid it on the grass. The infant was taken to the provost, and\r\nby him presented to the bailiff, when the inhuman monster decreed it to\r\nbe re-cast into the fire, that it might perish with its heretical\r\nmother! Thus was this innocent baptised in its own blood, to make up the\r\nvery climax of Romish barbarity; being born and dying at the same time a\r\nmartyr; and realizing again the days of Herodian cruelty, with\r\ncircumstances of bigoted malice unknown even to that execrable murderer.\r\n\r\nTheir execution took place, July 18, 1556. On the same day, were burnt\r\nat Grinstead, in Sussex, Thomas Dungate, John Foreman, and Mother Tree.\r\n\r\nJune 26, 1556, at Leicester, was executed Thomas Moor, a servant, aged\r\n24 years, who was taken up for saying that his Saviour was in Paradise,\r\nand not in the popish paste or wafer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joan Waste._\r\n\r\nThis poor honest woman, blind from her birth, and unmarried, aged 22,\r\nwas of the parish of Allhallows, Derby. Her father was a barber, and\r\nalso made ropes for a living: in which she assisted him, and also\r\nlearned to knit several articles of apparel. Refusing to communicate\r\nwith those who maintained doctrines contrary to those she had learned in\r\nthe days of the pious Edward, she was called before Dr. Draicot, the\r\nchancellor of bishop Blaine, and Peter Finch, official of Derby.\r\n\r\nWith sophistical arguments and threats they endeavoured to confound the\r\npoor girl; but she proffered to yield to the bishop's doctrine, if he\r\nwould answer for her at the day of judgment, (as pious Dr. Taylor had\r\ndone in his sermons) that his belief of the real presence of the\r\nsacrament was true. The bishop at first answered that he would; but Dr.\r\nDraicot reminding him that he might not in any way answer for a heretic,\r\nhe withdrew his confirmation of his own tenets; and she replied, that if\r\ntheir consciences would not permit them to answer at God's bar for that\r\ntruth they wished her to subscribe to, she would answer no more\r\nquestions. Sentence was then adjudged, and Dr. Draicot appointed to\r\npreach her condemned sermon, which took place August 1, 1556, the day of\r\nher martyrdom. His fulminating discourse being finished, the poor\r\nsightless object was taken to a place called Windmill Pit, near the\r\ntown, where she for a time held her brother by the hand, and then\r\nprepared herself for the fire, calling upon the pitying multitude to\r\npray with her, and upon Christ to have mercy upon her, till the glorious\r\nlight of the everlasting sun of righteousness beamed upon her departed\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nSeptember 8, 1556, Edward Sharp, aged 40, was condemned at Bristol.\r\nSeptember 24, Thomas Ravendale, a currier, and John Hart, suffered at\r\nMayfield, in Essex; and on the day following, a young man, a carpenter,\r\ndied at Bristol with joyous constancy. September 27, John Horn, and a\r\nfemale martyr suffered at Wooten-under-edge, Gloucestershire, professing\r\nabjurgation of popery.\r\n\r\nIn November, fifteen martyrs were imprisoned in Canterbury castle, of\r\nwhom all were either burnt or famished. Among the latter were J. Clark,\r\nD. Chittenden, W. Foster of Stone, Alice Potkins, and J. Archer, of\r\nCranbrooke, weaver. The two first of these had not received\r\ncondemnation, but the others were sentenced to the fire. Foster, at his\r\nexamination, observed upon the utility of carrying lighted candles about\r\non Candlemas-day, that he might as well carry a pitch fork; and that a\r\ngibbet would have as good an effect as the cross.\r\n\r\nWe have now brought to a close the sanguinary proscriptions of the\r\nmerciless Mary, in the year 1556, the number of which amounted to above\r\nEIGHTY-FOUR!\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the year 1557, was remarkable for the visit of Cardinal\r\nPole to the University of Cambridge, which seemed to stand in need of\r\nmuch cleansing from heretical preachers and reformed doctrines. One\r\nobject was also to play the popish farce of trying Martin Bucer and\r\nPaulus Phagius, who had been buried about three or four years; for which\r\npurpose the churches of St. Mary and St. Michael, where they lay, were\r\ninterdicted as vile and unholy places, unfit to worship God in, until\r\nthey were perfumed and washed with the Pope's holy water, &c. &c. The\r\ntrumpery act of citing these dead reformers to appear, not having had\r\nthe least effect upon them, on January 26, sentence of condemnation was\r\npassed, part of which ran in this manner, and may serve as a specimen of\r\nproceedings of this nature:--\"We therefore pronounce the said Martin\r\nBucer and Paulus Phagius excommunicated and anathematized, as well by\r\nthe common law, as by letters of process; and that their memory be\r\ncondemned, we also condemn their bodies and bones (which in that wicked\r\ntime of schism, and other heresies flourishing in this kingdom, were\r\nrashly buried in holy ground) to be dug up, and cast far from the bodies\r\nand bones of the faithful, according to the holy canons; and we command\r\nthat they and their writings, if any be there found, be publicly burnt;\r\nand we interdict all persons whatsoever of this university, town, or\r\nplaces adjacent, who shall read or conceal their heretical book, as\r\nwell by the common law, as by our letters of process!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the sentence thus read, the bishop commanded their bodies to be\r\ndug out of their graves, and being degraded from holy orders, delivered\r\nthem into the hands of the secular power; for it was not lawful for such\r\ninnocent persons as they were, abhorring all bloodshed, and detesting\r\nall desire of murder, to put any man to death.\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, the bodies, enclosed as they were in chests, were carried\r\ninto the midst of the market place at Cambridge, accompanied by a vast\r\nconcourse of people. A great post was set fast in the ground, to which\r\nthe chests were affixed with a large iron chain, and bound round their\r\ncentres, in the same manner as if the dead bodies had been alive. When\r\nthe fire began to ascend, and caught the coffins, a number of condemned\r\nbooks were also launched into the flames, and burnt. Justice, however,\r\nwas done to the memories of these pious and learned men in queen\r\nElizabeth's reign, when Mr. Ackworth, orator of the university, and Mr.\r\nJ. Pilkington, pronounced orations in honour of their memory, and in\r\nreprobation of their catholic persecutors.\r\n\r\nCardinal Cole also inflicted his harmless rage upon the dead body of\r\nPeter Martyr's wife, who, by his command, was dug out of her grave, and\r\nburied on a distant dunghill, partly because her bones lay near St.\r\nFridewide's relics, held once in great esteem in that college, and\r\npartly because he wished to purify Oxford of heretical remains as well\r\nas Cambridge. In the succeeding reign, however, her remains were\r\nrestored to their former cemetary, and even intermingled with those of\r\nthe catholic saint, to the utter astonishment and mortification of the\r\ndisciples of his holiness the pope.\r\n\r\nCardinal Cole published a list of fifty-four Articles, containing\r\ninstructions to the clergy of his diocess of Canterbury, some of which\r\nare too ludicrous and puerile to excite any other sentiment than\r\nlaughter in these days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecutions in the Diocess of Canterbury._\r\n\r\nIn the year 1557, fifteen were imprisoned in the castle of Canterbury,\r\nfive of whom perished of hunger. We now proceed to the account of the\r\nother ten; whose names were--J. Philpot, M. Bradbridge, N. Final, all of\r\nTenterden; W. Waterer and T. Stephens, of Beddington; J. Kempe, of\r\nNorgate; W. Hay, of Hithe; T. Hudson, of Salenge; W. Lowick, of\r\nCranbrooke; and W. Prowting, of Thornham. Of these Kempe, Waterer,\r\nProwting, Lowick, Hudson, and Hay, were burnt at Canterbury, January 15,\r\n1557: Stephens and Philpot at Wye, about the same time; and Final and\r\nBradbridge at Ashford, on the 16th. They were steadfast and immoveable\r\nin the faith.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February, the following persons were committed to\r\nprison:--R. Coleman, of Waldon, labourer; Joan Winseley, of Horsley\r\nMagna, spinster; S. Glover of Rayley; R. Clerk, of Much Holland,\r\nmariner; W. Munt, of Much Bentley, sawyer; Marg. Field, of Ramsey,\r\nspinster; R. Bongeor, currier; R. Jolley, mariner; Allen Simpson; Helen\r\nEwing; C. Pepper, widow; Alice Walley, (who recanted;) W. Bongeor,\r\nglazier; all of Colchester; R. Atkin, of Halstead, weaver; R. Barcock,\r\nof Wilton, carpenter; R. George, of Westbarhoalt, labourer; R. Debnam,\r\nof Debenham, weaver; C. Warren, of Cocksall, spinster; Agnes Whitlock,\r\nof Dover-court, spinster; Rose Allen, spinster; and T. Feresannes,\r\nminor; both of Colchester.\r\n\r\nThese persons were brought before Bonner, who would have immediately\r\nsent them to execution, but Cardinal Pole was for more merciful\r\nmeasures, and Bonner, in a letter of his to the cardinal, seems to be\r\nsensible that he had displeased him, for he has this expression,--\"I\r\nthought to have them all hither to Fulham, and to have given sentence\r\nagainst them; nevertheless, perceiving by my last doing that your grace\r\nwas offended, I thought it my duty, before I proceeded farther, to\r\ninform your grace.\" This circumstance verifies the account that the\r\ncardinal was a humane man; and though a zealous catholic, we, as\r\nprotestants, are willing to render him that honour which his merciful\r\ncharacter deserves. Some of the bitter persecutors denounced him to the\r\npope as a favourer of heretics, and he was summoned to Rome, but queen\r\nMary, by particular entreaty, procured his stay. However, before his\r\nlatter end, and a little before his last journey from Rome to England,\r\nhe was strongly suspected of favouring the doctrine of Luther.\r\n\r\n\r\n_T. Loseby, H. Ramsey, T. Thirtell, Margaret Hide, and Agnes Stanley._\r\n\r\nThese persons were successively called up, condemned, delivered over to\r\nthe sheriffs of London, in April 15, 1557, were conducted to Smithfield,\r\nthere to exchange a temporal life for a life eternal with him for whose\r\nsake and truth they perished.\r\n\r\nIn May following, W. Morant, S. Gratwick, and ---- King, suffered in St.\r\nGeorge's Field, Southwark.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Executions in Kent._\r\n\r\nThe following seven were arraigned for heresy: Joan Bainbridge, of\r\nStaplehurst; W. Appleby, Petronella his wife, and the wife of John\r\nManning, of Maidstone; B. Allin, and his wife Catherine, of Freytenden;\r\nand Elizabeth ----, a blind maiden. Allin was put in the stocks at\r\nnight, and some advised him to compromise a little, and go for the\r\nform's sake to mass, which he did next day, but, just before the\r\nsacring, as it is termed, he went into the churchyard, and so reasoned\r\nwith himself upon the absurdity of transubstantiation, that he staid\r\naway, and was soon after brought back again before Sir John Baker, and\r\ncondemned for heresy. He was burnt with the six before mentioned at\r\nMaidstone, the 18th of June, 1557.\r\n\r\nAs in the last sacrifice four women did honour to the truth, so in the\r\nfollowing auto-de-fe we have the like number of females and males, who\r\nsuffered June 30, 1557, at Canterbury, and were J. Fishcock, F. White,\r\nN. Pardue, Barbary Final, widow; Bradbridge's widow; Wilson's wife; and\r\nBenden's wife.\r\n\r\nOf this group we shall more particularly notice Alice Benden, wife of\r\nEdward Benden, of Staplehurst, Kent. She had been taken up in Oct. 1556,\r\nfor non-attendance, and released upon a strong injunction to mind her\r\nconduct. Her husband was a bigoted catholic, and publicly speaking of\r\nhis wife's contumacy, she was conveyed to Canterbury castle, where\r\nknowing, when she should be removed to the bishop's prison, she should\r\nbe almost starved upon three farthings a day, she endeavoured to prepare\r\nherself for this suffering by living upon two-pence halfpenny per day.\r\nJan. 22, 1557, her husband wrote to the bishop, that if his wife's\r\nbrother, Roger Hall, were to be kept from consoling and relieving her,\r\nshe might turn; on this account, she was moved to a prison called\r\nMonday's hole; her brother sought diligently for her, and at the end of\r\nfive weeks providentially heard her voice in the dungeon, but could no\r\notherwise relieve her, than by putting some money in a loaf, and\r\nsticking it on a long pole. Dreadful must have been the situation of\r\nthis poor victim, lying on straw, between stone walls, without a change\r\nof apparel, or the meanest requisites of cleanliness, during a period of\r\nnine weeks!\r\n\r\nMarch 25, she was summoned before the bishop, who, with rewards, offered\r\nher liberty if she would go home and be comfortable; but Mrs. Benden had\r\nbeen inured to suffering, and, showing him her contracted limbs and\r\nemaciated appearance, refused to swerve from the truth. She was however\r\nremoved from this Black Hole to the West gate, whence, about the end of\r\nApril, she was taken out to be condemned, and then committed to the\r\ncastle prison till the 19th of June, the day of her burning. At the\r\nstake, she gave her handkerchief to one John Banks, as a memorial; and\r\nfrom her waist she drew a white lace, desiring him to give it her\r\nbrother, and tell him, it was the last band that had bound her, except\r\nthe chain; and to her father she returned a shilling he had sent her.\r\n\r\nThe whole of these seven martyrs undressed themselves with alacrity,\r\nand, being prepared, knelt down, and prayed with an earnestness and\r\nChristian spirit that even the enemies of the Cross were affected. After\r\ninvocation made together, they were secured to the stake, and, being\r\nencompassed with the unsparing flames, they yielded their souls into the\r\nhands of the living Lord.\r\n\r\nMatthew Plaise, weaver, a sincere and shrewd Christian, of Stone, Kent,\r\nwas brought before Thomas, bishop of Dover, and other inquisitors, whom\r\nhe ingeniously teazed by his indirect answers, of which the following is\r\na specimen.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Harpsfield._ Christ called the bread his body; what dost thou say\r\nit is?\r\n\r\n_Plaise._ I do believe it was that which he gave them.\r\n\r\n_Dr. H._ What was that?\r\n\r\n_P._ That which he brake.\r\n\r\n_Dr. H._ What did he break?\r\n\r\n_P._ That which he took.\r\n\r\n_Dr. H._ What did he take?\r\n\r\n_P._ The text saith, \"He took bread.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. H._ Well, then, thou sayest it was but bread which the disciples\r\ndid eat.\r\n\r\n_P._ I say, what he gave them, that did they eat indeed.\r\n\r\nA very long disputation followed, in which Plaise was desired to humble\r\nhimself to the bishop; but this he refused. Whether this zealous person\r\ndied in prison, was executed, or delivered, history does not mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Execution of ten martyrs at Lewes._\r\n\r\nAgain we have to record the wholesale sacrifice of Christ's little\r\nflock, of whom five were women. On the 22d of June, 1557, the town of\r\nLewes beheld ten persons doomed to perish by fire and persecution. The\r\nnames of these worthies were, Richard Woodman; G. Stephens, W. Mainard,\r\nAlex. Hosman, and Thomasin Wood, servants; Margery Morris, and James\r\nMorris, her son; Dennis Burges, Ashdon's wife, and Grove's wife.\r\n\r\nThese nine persons were taken a few days only before their judgment, and\r\nsuffered at Lewes, in Sussex, June 22, 1557. Of these, eight were\r\nprematurely executed, inasmuch as the writ from London could not have\r\narrived for their burning. A person named Ambrose died in Maidstone\r\nprison about this time.\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. John Hullier was brought up at Eton college, and in process of\r\ntime became curate of Babram, three miles from Cambridge and went\r\nafterward to Lynn; where, opposing the superstition of the papists, he\r\nwas carried before Dr. Thirlby, bishop of Ely, and sent to Cambridge\r\ncastle: here he lay for a time, and was then sent to the Tolbooth\r\nprison, where, after three months, he was brought to St. Mary's church,\r\nand condemned by Dr. Fuller. On Maunday Thursday, he was brought to the\r\nstake: while undressing, he told the people to bear witness that he was\r\nabout to suffer in a just cause, and exhorted them to believe, that\r\nthere was no other rock than Jesus Christ to build upon. A priest, named\r\nBoyes, then desired the mayor to silence him. After praying, he went\r\nmeekly to the stake, and being bound with a chain, and placed in a pitch\r\nbarrel, fire was applied to the reeds and wood; but the wind drove the\r\nfire directly to his back, which caused him under the severe agony to\r\npray the more fervently. His friends directed the executioner to fire\r\nthe pile to windward of his face, which was immediately done.\r\n\r\nA quantity of books were now thrown into the fire, one of which (the\r\nCommunion Service) he caught, opened it, and joyfully continued to read\r\nit, until the fire and smoke deprived him of sight; then even, in\r\nearnest prayer, he pressed the book to his heart, thanking God for\r\nbestowing on him in his last moments this precious gift.--The day being\r\nhot, the fire burnt fiercely; and at a time when the spectators supposed\r\nhe was no more, he suddenly exclaimed, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!\r\nAnd meekly resigned his life. He was burnt on Jesus Green, not far from\r\nJesus College. He had gunpowder given him, but he was dead before it\r\nbecame ignited. This pious sufferer afforded a singular spectacle; for\r\nhis flesh was so burnt from the bones, which continued erect, that he\r\npresented the idea of a skeleton figure chained to the stake. His\r\nremains were eagerly seized by the multitude, and venerated by all who\r\nadmired his piety or detested inhuman bigotry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Simon Miller and Elizabeth Cooper,_\r\n\r\nIn the following month of July, received the crown of martyrdom. Miller\r\ndwelt at Lynn, and came to Norwich, where, planting himself at the door\r\nof one of the churches, as the people came out, he requested to know of\r\nthem where he could go to receive the communion. For this a priest\r\nbrought him before Dr. Dunning, who committed him to ward; but he was\r\nsuffered to go home, and arrange his affairs; after which he returned to\r\nthe bishop's house, and to his prison, where he remained till the 13th\r\nof July, the day of his burning.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Cooper, wife of a pewterer, of St. Andrews, Norwich, had\r\nrecanted; but, tortured for what she had done by the worm which dieth\r\nnot, she shortly after voluntarily entered her parish church during the\r\ntime of the popish service, and standing up, audibly proclaimed that she\r\nrevoked her former recantation, and cautioned the people to avoid her\r\nunworthy example. She was taken from her own house by Mr. Sutton the\r\nsheriff, who very reluctantly complied with the letter of the law, as\r\nthey had been servants and in friendship together. At the stake, the\r\npoor sufferer, feeling the fire, uttered the cry of Oh! upon which Mr.\r\nMiller, putting his hand behind him towards her, desired her to be of\r\ngood courage, \"for (said he) good sister, we shall have a joyful and a\r\nsweet supper.\" Encouraged by this example and exhortation, she stood the\r\nfiery ordeal without flinching, and, with him, proved the power of faith\r\nover the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Executions at Colchester._\r\n\r\nIt was before mentioned that twenty-two persons had been sent up from\r\nCholchester, who upon a slight submission, were afterward released. Of\r\nthese, Wm. Munt, of Much-Bentley, husbandman, with Alice, his wife, and\r\nRose Allin, her daughter, upon their return home, abstained from church,\r\nwhich induced the bigoted priest secretly to write to Bonner. For a\r\nshort time they absconded, but returning again, March 7th, one Mr.\r\nEdmund Tyrrel, (a relation of the Tyrrel who murdered king Edward V. and\r\nhis brother) with the officers, entered the house while Munt and his\r\nwife were in bed, and informed them that they must go to Colchester\r\nCastle. Mrs. Munt at that time very ill, requested her daughter to get\r\nher some drink; leave being permitted, Rose took a candle and a mug; and\r\nin returning through the house was met by Tyrrel, who cautioned her to\r\nadvise her parents to become good catholics. Rose briefly informed him\r\nthat they had the Holy Ghost for their adviser; and that she was ready\r\nto lay down her own life for the same cause. Turning to his company, he\r\nremarked that she was willing to burn; and one of them told him to prove\r\nher, and see what she would do by and by. The unfeeling wretch\r\nimmediately executed this project; and, seizing the young woman by the\r\nwrist, he held the lighted candle under her hand, burning it crosswise\r\non the back, till the tendons divided from the flesh, during which he\r\nloaded her with many opprobious epithets. She endured his rage unmoved,\r\nand then, when he had ceased the torture, she asked him to begin at her\r\nfeet or head, for he need not fear that his employer would one day repay\r\nhim. After this she took the drink to her mother.\r\n\r\nThis cruel act of torture does not stand alone on record. Bonner had\r\nserved a poor blind harper in nearly the same manner, who had steadily\r\nmaintained a hope that if every joint of him were to be burnt, he should\r\nnot fly from the faith. Bonner, upon this, privately made a signal to\r\nhis men, to bring a burning coal, which they placed in the poor man's\r\nhand, and then by force held it closed, till it burnt into the flesh\r\ndeeply. But to return.--\r\n\r\nIn searching Munt's house, John Thurston and Margaret his wife were\r\nfound, and conveyed to Colchester Castle; where lay J. Johnson, of\r\nThorp, Essex, aged 34, widower, with his three young children, all\r\nindicted for heresy.\r\n\r\nThe following lay in Mote-hall, or town prison: Wm. Bongeor, of St.\r\nNicholas, in Colchester; Thomas Penold, Colchester, tallow chandler; W.\r\nPucras, of Bocking, Essex, fuller, 20; Agnes Silversides, Colchester,\r\nwidow, 70; Helen Ewring, wife of John Ewring, miller, of Colchester, 45;\r\nand Eliz. Folks, a servant, Colchester.\r\n\r\nShortly after their condemnation, Bonner's writ arrived for their\r\nexecution, which was fixed for the 2d of August, 1557. About seven\r\no'clock in the morning, the town prisoners in the Mote-hall were brought\r\nto a plot of ground on the outside of the town wall, where the stake was\r\nerected, surrounded by fagots and fuel. Having prayed, and prepared\r\nthemselves for the fiery torment, Elizabeth Folks, as she was standing\r\nat the stake, received a dreadful blow on the shoulder from the stroke\r\nof a hammer, which was aimed at the staple that secured the chain. This,\r\nhowever, in no wise discomposed her, but turning her head round, she\r\ncontinued to pray and exhort the people. Fire being put to the pile,\r\nthese martyrs died amidst the prayers and commisseration of thousands\r\nwho came to be witnesses of their fortitude and their faith.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, in the afternoon, the county prisoners from\r\nColchester castle were brought out, and executed, at different stakes,\r\non the same spot; praising God, and exhorting the people to avoid\r\nidolatry and the church of Rome.\r\n\r\nJohn Thurston, of whom mention was made before, died in May, in\r\nColchester castle.\r\n\r\nGeorge Eagles, tailor, was indicted for having prayed that \"God would\r\nturn queen Mary's heart, or take her away;\" the ostensible cause of his\r\ndeath was his religion, for treason could hardly be imagined in praying\r\nfor the reformation of such an execrable soul as that of Mary. Being\r\ncondemned for this crime, he was drawn to the place of execution upon a\r\nsledge, with two robbers, who were executed with him. After Eagles had\r\nmounted the ladder, and been turned off a short time, he was cut down,\r\nbefore he was at all insensible; a bailiff, named Wm. Swallow, then\r\ndragged him to the sledge, and with a common blunt cleaver, hacked off\r\nthe head: in a manner equally clumsy and cruel, he opened his body and\r\ntore out the heart.\r\n\r\nIn all this suffering the poor martyr repined not, but to the last\r\ncalled upon his Saviour. The fury of these bigots did not end here; the\r\nintestines were burnt, and the body was quartered, the four parts being\r\nsent to Colchester, Harwich, Chelmsford, and St. Rouse's.--Chelmsford\r\nhad the honor of retaining his head, which was affixed to a long pole in\r\nthe market-place. In time it was blown down, and lay several days in the\r\nstreets, till it was buried at night in the church-yard. God's judgment\r\nnot long after fell upon Swallow, who in his old age became a beggar,\r\nand affected with a leprosy that made him obnoxious even to the animal\r\ncreation; nor did Richard Potts, who troubled Eagles in his dying\r\nmoments, escape the visiting hand of God.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Richard Crashfield, of Wymundham, suffered at Norwich.\r\n\r\nNearly about this time a person named Fryer, and the sister of George\r\nEagles, suffered martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Joyce Lewes._\r\n\r\nThis lady was the wife of Mr. T. Lewes, of Manchester. She had received\r\nthe Romish religion as true, till the burning of that pious martyr, the\r\nRev. Mr. Saunders, at Coventry. Understanding that his death arose from\r\na refusal to receive the mass, she began to inquire into the ground of\r\nhis refusal, and her conscience, as it began to be enlightened, became\r\nrestless and alarmed. In this inquietude, she resorted to Mr. John\r\nGlover, who lived near, and requested that he would unfold those rich\r\nsources of gospel knowledge he possessed, particularly upon the subject\r\nof transubstantiation. He easily succeeded in convincing her that the\r\nmummery of popery and the mass were at variance with God's most holy\r\nword, and honestly reproved her for following too much the vanities of a\r\nwicked world. It was to her indeed a word in season, for she soon become\r\nweary of her former sinful life, and resolved to abandon the mass and\r\nidolatrous worship. Though compelled by her husband's violence to go to\r\nchurch, her contempt of the holy water and other ceremonies were so\r\nmanifest, that she was accused before the bishop for despising the\r\nsacramentals.\r\n\r\nA citation, addressed to her, immediately followed, which was given to\r\nMr. Lewes, who, in a fit of passion, held a dagger to the throat of the\r\nofficer, and made him eat it, after which he caused him to drink it\r\ndown, and then sent him away. But for this the bishop summoned Mr. Lewes\r\nbefore him as well as his wife; the former readily submitted, but the\r\nlatter resolutely affirmed, that, in refusing holy water, she neither\r\noffended God, nor any part of his laws. She was sent home for a month,\r\nher husband being bound for her appearance, during which time Mr. Glover\r\nimpressed upon her the necessity of doing what she did, not from\r\nself-vanity, but for the honour and glory of God.\r\n\r\nMr. Glover and others earnestly exhorted Lewes to forfeit the money he\r\nwas bound in, rather than subject his wife to certain death; but he was\r\ndeaf to the voice of humanity, and delivered her over to the bishop, who\r\nsoon found a sufficient cause to consign her to a loathsome prison,\r\nwhence she was several times brought for examination. At the last time\r\nthe bishop reasoned with her upon the fitness of her coming to mass, and\r\nreceiving as sacred the sacrament and sacramentals of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\"If these things were in the word of God,\" said Mrs. Lewes, \"I would\r\nwith all my heart receive, believe, and esteem them.\" The bishop, with\r\nthe most ignorant and impious effrontery, replied, \"If thou wilt believe\r\nno more than what is warranted by scripture, thou art in a state of\r\ndamnation!\" Astonished at such a declaration, this worthy sufferer ably\r\nrejoined, \"that his words were as impure, as they were profane.\"\r\n\r\nAfter condemnation, she lay a twelvemonth in prison, the sheriff not\r\nbeing willing to put her to death in his time, though he had been but\r\njust chosen. When her death warrant came from London, she sent for some\r\nfriends, whom she consulted in what manner her death might be more\r\nglorious to the name of God, and injurious to the cause of God's\r\nenemies. Smilingly, she said, \"As for death, I think but lightly of.\r\nWhen I know that I shall behold the amiable countenance of Christ my\r\ndear Saviour, the ugly face of death does not much trouble me.\" The\r\nevening before she suffered, two priests were anxious to visit her, but\r\nshe refused both their confession and absolution, when she could hold a\r\nbetter communication with the High Priest of souls. About three o'clock\r\nin the morning, Satan began to shoot his fiery darts, by putting into\r\nher mind to doubt whether she was chosen to eternal life, and Christ\r\ndied for her. Her friends readily pointed out to her those consolatory\r\npassages of Scripture which comfort the fainting heart, and treat of the\r\nRedeemer who taketh away the sins of the world.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock the sheriff announced to her that she had but an\r\nhour to live; she was at first cast down, but this soon passed away, and\r\nshe thanked God that her life was about to be devoted to his service.\r\nThe sheriff granted permission for two friends to accompany her to the\r\nstake--an indulgence for which he was afterward severely handled. Mr.\r\nReniger and Mr. Bernher led her to the place of execution; in going to\r\nwhich, from its distance, her great weakness, and the press of the\r\npeople, she had nearly fainted. Three times she prayed fervently that\r\nGod would deliver the land from popery and the idolatrous mass; and the\r\npeople for the most part, as well as the sheriff, said Amen.\r\n\r\nWhen she had prayed, she took the cup, (which had been filled with water\r\nto refresh her,) and said, I drink to all them that unfeignedly love the\r\ngospel of Christ, and wish for the abolition of popery. Her friends, and\r\na great many women of the place, drank with her, for which most of them\r\nafterward were enjoined penance.\r\n\r\nWhen chained to the stake, her countenance was cheerful, and the roses\r\nof her cheeks were not abated. Her hands were extended towards heaven\r\ntill the fire rendered them powerless, when her soul was received into\r\nthe arms of the Creator. The duration of her agony was but short, as the\r\nunder-sheriff, at the request of her friends, had prepared such\r\nexcellent fuel that she was in a few minutes overwhelmed with smoke and\r\nflame. The case of this lady drew a tear of pity from every one who had\r\na heart not callous to humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Executions at Islington._\r\n\r\nAbout the 17th of Sept. suffered at Islington the following four\r\nprofessors of Christ: Ralph Allerton, James Austoo, Margery Austoo, and\r\nRichard Roth.\r\n\r\nJames Austoo and his wife, of St. Allhallows, Barking, London, were\r\nsentenced for not believing in the presence. Richard Roth rejected the\r\nseven sacraments, and was accused of comforting the heretics by the\r\nfollowing letter written in his own blood, and intended to have been\r\nsent to his friends at Colchester:--\r\n\r\n        \"O dear Brethren and Sisters,\r\n\r\n    \"How much reason have you to rejoice in God, that\r\n    he hath given you such faith to overcome this\r\n    blood-thirsty tyrant thus far! And no doubt he that\r\n    hath begun that good work in you, will fulfil it\r\n    unto the end. O dear hearts in Christ, what a crown\r\n    of glory shall ye receive with Christ in the\r\n    kingdom of God! O that it had been the good will of\r\n    God that I had been ready to have gone with you;\r\n    for I lie in my lord's Little-ease by day, and in\r\n    the night I lie in the Coal-house, apart from Ralph\r\n    Allerton, or any other; and we look every day when\r\n    we shall be condemned; for he said that I should be\r\n    burned within ten days before Easter; but I lie\r\n    still at the pool's brink, and every man goeth in\r\n    before me; but we abide patiently the Lord's\r\n    leisure, with many bonds, in fetters and stocks, by\r\n    which we have received great joy of God. And now\r\n    fare you well, dear brethren and sisters, in this\r\n    world, but I trust to see you in the heavens face\r\n    to face.\r\n\r\n    \"O brother Munt, with your wife and my sister Rose,\r\n    how blessed are you in the Lord, that God hath\r\n    found you worthy to suffer for his sake! with all\r\n    the rest of my dear brethren and sisters known and\r\n    unknown. O be joyful even unto death. Fear it not,\r\n    saith Christ, for I have overcome death. O dear\r\n    hearts, seeing that Jesus Christ will be our help,\r\n    O tarry you the Lord's leisure. Be strong, let your\r\n    hearts be of good comfort, and wait you still for\r\n    the Lord. He is at hand. Yea, the angel of the Lord\r\n    pitcheth his tent round about them that fear him,\r\n    and delivereth them which way he seeth best. For\r\n    our lives are in the Lord's hands; and they can do\r\n    nothing unto us before God suffer them. Therefore\r\n    give all thanks to God.\r\n\r\n    \"O dear hearts, you shall be clothed in long white\r\n    garments upon the mount of Sion, with the multitude\r\n    of saints, and with Jesus Christ our Saviour, who\r\n    will never forsake us. O blessed virgins, ye have\r\n    played the wise virgins' part, in that ye have\r\n    taken oil in your lamps that ye may go in with the\r\n    bridegroom, when he cometh, into the everlasting\r\n    joy with him. But as for the foolish, they shall be\r\n    shut out, because they made not themselves ready to\r\n    suffer with Christ, neither go about to take up his\r\n    cross. O dear hearts, how precious shall your death\r\n    be in the sight of the Lord! for dear is the death\r\n    of his saints. O fare you well, and pray. The grace\r\n    of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen,\r\n    Amen. Pray, pray, pray!\r\n\r\n        \"Written by me, with my own blood,\r\n                                       \"RICHARD ROTH.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter, so justly denominating Bonner the \"blood-thirsty tyrant,\"\r\nwas not likely to excite his compassion. Roth accused him of bringing\r\nthem to secret examination by night, because he was afraid of the people\r\nby day. Resisting every temptation to recant, he was condemned, and,\r\nSept. 17, 1557, these four martyrs perished at Islington, for the\r\ntestimony of the Lamb, who was slain that they might be of the redeemed\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nAgnes Bengeor and Margaret Thurston were doomed to the fire at\r\nColchester, Sept. 17, 1557. Humbly they knelt to pray, and joyfully they\r\narose to be chained to the stake, uttering invocations and hallelujahs,\r\ntill the surrounding flames mounted to the seat of life, and their\r\nspirits ascended to the Almighty Saviour of all who truly believe!\r\n\r\nAbout this time suffered, at Northampton, John Kurde, shoemaker of\r\nSyrsam, Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\nJohn Noyes, a shoemaker, of Laxfield, Suffolk, was taken to Eye and at\r\nmidnight, Sept. 21, 1557, he was brought from Eye to Laxfield to be\r\nburned. On the following morning he was led to the stake, prepared for\r\nthe horrid sacrifice. Mr. Noyes, on coming to the fatal spot, knelt\r\ndown, prayed, and rehearsed the 50th psalm. When the chain enveloped\r\nhim, he said, \"Fear not them that kill the body, but fear him that can\r\nkill both body and soul, and cast it into everlasting fire!\" As one\r\nCadman placed a fagot against him, he blessed the hour in which he was\r\nborn to die for the truth: and while trusting only upon the\r\nall-sufficient merits of the Redeemer, fire was set to the pile, and\r\nthe blazing fagots in a short time stifled his last words, Lord, have\r\nmercy on me!--Christ, have Mercy upon me!--The ashes of the body were\r\nburied in a pit, and with them one of his feet, whole to the ankle, with\r\nthe stocking on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Cicely Ormes._\r\n\r\nThis young martyr, aged twenty-two, was the wife of Mr. Edmund Ormes,\r\nworsted weaver of St. Lawrence, Norwich. At the death of Miller and\r\nElizabeth Cooper, before mentioned, she had said that she would pledge\r\nthem of the same cup they drank of. For these words she was brought to\r\nthe chancellor, who would have discharged her upon promising to go to\r\nchurch, and to keep her belief to herself. As she would not consent to\r\nthis, the chancellor urged that he had shown more lenity to her than any\r\nother person, and was unwilling to condemn her, because she was an\r\nignorant foolish woman; to this she replied, (perhaps with more\r\nshrewdness than he expected,) that, however great his desire might be to\r\nspare her sinful flesh, it could not equal her inclination to surrender\r\nit up in so great a quarrel. The chancellor then pronounced the fiery\r\nsentence, and, September 23, 1557, she was brought to the stake, at\r\neight o'clock in the morning. After declaring her faith to the people,\r\nshe laid her hand on the stake, and said, \"Welcome thou cross of\r\nChrist.\" Her hand was sooted in doing this, (for it was the same stake\r\nat which Miller and Cooper were burnt,) and she at first wiped it; but\r\ndirectly after again welcomed and embraced it as the \"sweet cross of\r\nChrist.\" After the tormentors had kindled the fire, she said, \"My soul\r\ndoth magnify the Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God my Saviour.\"\r\nThen crossing her hands upon her breast, and looking upwards with the\r\nutmost serenity, she stood the fiery furnace. Her hands continued\r\ngradually to rise till the sinews were dried, and then they fell. She\r\nuttered no sigh of pain, but yielded her life, an emblem of that\r\ncelestial paradise in which is the presence of God, blessed for ever.\r\n\r\nIt might be contended that this martyr voluntarily sought her own death,\r\nas the chancellor scarcely exacted any other penance of her than to keep\r\nher belief to herself; yet it should seem in this instance as if God had\r\nchosen her to be a shining light, for a twelve-month before she was\r\ntaken, she had recanted; but she was wretched till the chancellor was\r\ninformed, by letter, that she repented of her recantation from the\r\nbottom of her heart. As if to compensate for her former apostacy, and to\r\nconvince the catholics that she meant no more to compromise for her\r\npersonal security, she boldly refused his friendly offer of permitting\r\nher to temporize. Her courage in such a cause deserves commendation--the\r\ncause of Him who has said, Whoever is ashamed of me on earth, of such\r\nwill I be ashamed in heaven.\r\n\r\nIn November, Thomas Spurdance, one of queen Mary's servants, was brought\r\nbefore the chancellor of Norwich, who, among his interrogations, was\r\nseverely recriminated upon by the prisoner. This good man was taken by\r\ntwo of his fellow-servants, dwelling at Codman, in Suffolk. He was sent\r\nto Bury where he remained some time in prison, and in November, 1557,\r\nbraved the fiery indignation of the enemies of Christ with Christian\r\nfortitude and resignation.\r\n\r\nJ. Hallingdale, W. Sparrow, and R Gibson, suffered in Smithfield\r\nNovember 18th, 1557.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rev. John Rough._\r\n\r\nThis pious martyr was a Scotchman: at the age of 17, he entered himself\r\nas one of the order of Black Friars, at Stirling, in Scotland. He had\r\nbeen kept out of an inheritance by his friends, and he took this step in\r\nrevenge for their conduct to him. After being there sixteen years, Lord\r\nHamilton, Earl of Arran, taking a liking to him, the archbishop of St.\r\nAndrew's induced the provincial of the house to dispense with his habit\r\nand order; and he thus became the Earl's chaplain. He remained in this\r\nspiritual employment a year, and in that time God wrought in him a\r\nsaving knowledge of the truth; for which reason the Earl sent him to\r\npreach in the freedom of Ayr, where he remained four years; but finding\r\ndanger there from the religious complexion of the times, and learning\r\nthat there was much gospel freedom in England, he travelled up to the\r\nduke of Somerset, then Lord Protector of England, who gave him a yearly\r\nsalary of twenty pounds, and authorized him, to preach at Carlisle,\r\nBerwick, and Newcastle, where he married. He was afterward removed to a\r\nbenefice at Hull, in which he remained till the death of Edward VI.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the tide of persecution then setting in, he fled with\r\nhis wife to Friesland, and at Nordon they followed the occupation of\r\nknitting hose, caps, &c. for subsistence. Impeded in his business by the\r\nwant of yarn, he came over to England to procure a quantity, and on Nov.\r\n10th, arrived in London, where he soon heard of a secret society of the\r\nfaithful, to whom he joined himself, and was in a short time elected\r\ntheir minister, in which occupation he strengthened them in every good\r\nresolution. Dec. 12th, through the information of one Taylor, a member\r\nof the society, Mr. Rough, with Cuthbert Symson and others, was taken up\r\nin the Saracen's Head, Islington, where, under the pretext of coming to\r\nsee a play, their religious exercises were holden. The queen's\r\nvice-chamberlain conducted Rough and Symson before the council, in whose\r\npresence they were charged with meeting to celebrate the communion. The\r\ncouncil wrote to Bonner and he lost no time in this affair of blood. In\r\nthree days he had him up, and on the next (the 20th) resolved to condemn\r\nhim. The charges laid against him were, that he, being a priest, was\r\nmarried, and that he had rejected the service in the Latin tongue. Rough\r\nwanted not arguments to reply to these flimsy tenets. In short, he was\r\ndegraded and condemned.\r\n\r\nMr. Rough, it should be noticed, when in the north, in Edward the VIth's\r\nreign, had saved Dr. Watson's life, who afterward sat with bishop\r\nBonner on the bench. This ungrateful prelate, in return for the kind act\r\nhe had received, boldly accused Mr. Rough of being the most pernicious\r\nheretic in the country. The godly minister reproved him for his\r\nmalicious spirit; he affirmed that, during the thirty years he had\r\nlived, he had never bowed the knee to Baal; and that twice at Rome he\r\nhad seen the pope borne about on men's shoulders with the false-named\r\nsacrament carried before him, presenting a true picture of the very\r\nantichrist; yet was more reverence shown to him than to the wafer, which\r\nthey accounted to be their God. \"Ah?\" said Bonner, rising up, and making\r\ntowards him, as if he would have torn his garment, \"hast thou been at\r\nRome, and seen our holy father the pope, and dost thou blaspheme him\r\nafter this sort?\" This said, he fell upon him, tore off a piece of his\r\nbeard, and, that the day might begin to his own satisfaction, he ordered\r\nthe object of his rage to be burnt by half past five the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cuthbert Symson._\r\n\r\nFew professors of Christ possessed more activity and zeal than this\r\nexcellent person. He not only labored to preserve his friends from the\r\ncontagion of popery, but to guard them against the terrors of\r\npersecution. He was deacon of the little congregation over which Mr.\r\nRough presided as minister.\r\n\r\nMr. Symson has written an account of his own sufferings, which we cannot\r\ndetail better than in his own words:\r\n\r\n\"On the 13th of December, 1557, I was committed by the council to the\r\ntower of London. On the following Thursday, I was called into the\r\nware-room, before the constable of the tower, and the recorder of\r\nLondon, Mr. Cholmly, who commanded me to inform them of the names of\r\nthose who came to the English service. I answered, that I would declare\r\nnothing; in consequence of my refusal, I was set upon a rack of iron, as\r\nI judge for the space of three hours!\r\n\r\n\"They then asked me if I would confess: I answered as before. After\r\nbeing unbound, I was carried back to my lodging. The Sunday after I was\r\nbrought to the same place again, before the lieutenant and recorder of\r\nLondon, and they examined me. As I had answered before, so I answered\r\nnow. Then the lieutenant swore by God I should tell; after which my two\r\nfore-fingers were bound together, and a small arrow placed between them,\r\nthey drew it through so fast that the blood followed, and the arrow\r\nbrake.\r\n\r\n\"After enduring the rack twice again, I was retaken to my lodging, and\r\nten days after the lieutenant asked me if I would not now confess that\r\nwhich they had before asked of me. I answered, that I had already said\r\nas much as I would. Three weeks after I was sent to the priest, where I\r\nwas greatly assaulted, and at whose hand I received the pope's curse,\r\nfor bearing witness of the resurrection of Christ. And thus I commend\r\nyou to God, and to the word of his grace, with all those who unfeignedly\r\ncall upon the name of Jesus; desiring God of his endless mercy, through\r\nthe merits of his dear Son Jesus Christ, to bring us all to his\r\neverlasting kingdom, Amen. I praise God for his great mercy shown upon\r\nus. Sing Hosanna to the Highest with me, Cuthbert Symson. God forgive my\r\nsins! I ask forgiveness of all the world, and I forgive all the world,\r\nand thus I leave the world, in the hope of a joyful resurrection!\"\r\n\r\nIf this account be duly considered, what a picture of repeated tortures\r\ndoes it present! But, even the cruelty of the narration is exceeded by\r\nthe patient meekness with which it was endured. Here are no expressions\r\nof malice, no invocations even of God's retributive justice, not a\r\ncomplaint of suffering wrongfully! On the contrary, praise to God,\r\nforgiveness of sin, and a forgiving all the world, concludes this\r\nunaffected interesting narrative.\r\n\r\nBonner's admiration was excited by the steadfast coolness of this\r\nmartyr. Speaking of Mr. Symson in the consistory, he said, \"You see what\r\na personable man he is, and then of his patience, I affirm, that, if he\r\nwere not a heretic, he is a man of the greatest patience that ever came\r\nbefore me. Thrice in one day has he been racked in the tower: in my\r\nhouse also he has felt sorrow, and yet never have I seen his patience\r\nbroken.\"\r\n\r\nThe day before this pious deacon was to be condemned, while in the\r\nstocks in the bishop's coal-house, he had the vision of a glorified\r\nform, which much encouraged him. This he certainly attested to his wife,\r\nMr. Austen, and others, before his death; but Mr. Fox, in reciting this\r\narticle, leaves it to the reader's judgment, to consider it either as a\r\nnatural or supernatural circumstance.\r\n\r\nWith this ornament of the Christian reformation were apprehended Mr.\r\nHugh Foxe and John Devinish; the three were brought before Bonner, March\r\n19, 1558, and the papistical articles tendered. They rejected them, and\r\nwere all condemned. As they worshipped together in the same society, at\r\nIslington, so they suffered together in Smithfield, March 28; in whose\r\ndeath the God of Grace was glorified, and true believers confirmed!\r\n\r\nWm. Nichol, of Haverfordwest, Wales, was taken up for reprobating the\r\npractice of the worshippers of antichrist, and April 9, 1558, bore\r\ntestimony to the truth at Haverfordwest, in Wales, by enduring the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Hudson, Thomas Carman, and William Seamen,_\r\n\r\nWere condemned by a bigoted vicar of Aylesbury, named Berry. The spot of\r\nexecution was called Lollard's pit, without Bishopsgate, at Norwich.\r\nAfter joining together in humble petition to the throne of grace, they\r\nrose, went to the stake, and were encircled with their chains. To the\r\ngreat surprise of the spectators, Hudson slipped from under his chain,\r\nand came forward. A great opinion prevailed that he was about to recant;\r\nothers thought that he wanted further time. In the mean time, his\r\ncompanions at the stake urged every promise and exhortation to support\r\nhim. The hopes of the enemies of the cross, however, were disappointed:\r\nthe good man, far from fearing the smallest personal terror at the\r\napproaching pangs of death, was only alarmed that his Saviour's face\r\nseemed to be hidden from him. Falling upon his knees, his spirit\r\nwrestled with God and God verified the words of his Son, \"Ask, and it\r\nshall be given.\" The martyr rose in an ecstacy of joy, and exclaimed,\r\n\"Now, I thank God, I am strong! and care not what man can do to me!\"\r\nWith an unruffled countenance he replaced himself under the chain,\r\njoined his fellow-sufferers, and with them suffered death, to the\r\ncomfort of the godly, and the confusion of antichrist.\r\n\r\nBerry, unsatiated with this demoniacal act, summoned up two hundred\r\npersons in the town of Aylesham, whom he compelled to kneel to the cross\r\nat Pentecost, and inflicted other punishments. He struck a poor man for\r\na trifling word, with a flail, which proved fatal to the unoffending\r\nobject. He also gave a woman named Alice Oxes, so heavy a blow with his\r\nfist, as she met him entering the hall when he was in an ill-humour,\r\nthat she died with the violence. This priest was rich, and possessed\r\ngreat authority; he was a reprobate, and, like the priesthood, he\r\nabstained from marriage, to enjoy the more a debauched and licentious\r\nlife. The Sunday after the death of queen Mary, he was revelling with\r\none of his concubines, before vespers; he then went to church,\r\nadministered baptism, and in his return to his lascivious pastime, he\r\nwas smitten by the hand of God. Without a moment given for repentance,\r\nhe fell to the ground, and a groan was the only articulation permitted\r\nhim. In him we may behold the difference between the end of a martyr and\r\na persecutor.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, William Harris, Richard Day, and Christiana George,\r\nsuffered at Colchester, and there humbly made an offering of themselves\r\nto God.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apprehensions at Islington._\r\n\r\nIn a retired close, near a field, in Islington, a company of decent\r\npersons had assembled, to the number of forty. While they were\r\nreligiously engaged in praying and expounding the scripture,\r\ntwenty-seven of them were carried before Sir Roger Cholmly. Some of the\r\nwomen made their escape, twenty-two were committed to Newgate, who\r\ncontinued in prison seven weeks. Previous to their examination, they\r\nwere informed by the keeper, (Alexander,) that nothing more was\r\nrequisite to procure their discharge, than to hear mass. Easy as this\r\ncondition may seem, these martyrs valued their purity of conscience more\r\nthan loss of life or property; hence, thirteen were burnt, seven in\r\nSmithfield, and six at Brentford; two died in prison, and the other\r\nseven were providentially preserved. The names of the seven who suffered\r\nwere, H. Pond, R. Estland, R. Southain, M. Ricarby, J. Floyd, J.\r\nHoliday, and R. Holland. They were sent to Newgate June 16, 1558, and\r\nexecuted on the 27th.\r\n\r\nThe story of Roger Holland is the only one of these martyrs which has\r\nbeen handed down to us. He was first an apprentice to one Mr. Kempton,\r\nat the Black-Boy, Watling-street. He was, in every sense of the word,\r\nlicentious, a lover of bad company, and, more than all, a stubborn\r\ndetermined papist--one of whom it might be said, that a miracle only\r\ncould effect his conversion. Dissipated as he was, his master had the\r\nimprudent confidence to trust him with money; and, having received\r\nthirty pounds on his master's account, he lost it at the gaming table.\r\nKnowing it was impossible to regain his character, he determined to\r\nwithdraw to France or Flanders.--With this resolution, he called early\r\nin the morning on a discreet servant in the house, named Elizabeth, who\r\nprofessed the gospel, and lived a life that did honour to her\r\nprofession. To her he revealed the loss his folly had occasioned,\r\nregretted that he had not followed her advice, and begged her to give\r\nhis master a note of hand from him acknowledging the debt, which he\r\nwould repay if ever it were in his power; he also entreated his\r\ndisgraceful conduct might be kept secret, lest it would bring the grey\r\nhairs of his father with sorrow to a premature grave.\r\n\r\nThe maid, with a generosity and Christian principle rarely surpassed,\r\nconscious that his imprudence might be his ruin, brought him the thirty\r\npounds, which was part of a sum of money recently left her by legacy.\r\n\"Here,\" said she, \"is the sum requisite: you shall take the money, and I\r\nwill keep the note; but expressly on this condition, that you abandon\r\nall lewd and vicious company; that you neither swear nor talk\r\nimmodestly, and game no more; for, should I learn that you do, I will\r\nimmediately show this note to your master. I also require, that you\r\nshall promise me to attend the daily lecture at Allhallows, and the\r\nsermon at St. Paul's every Sunday; that you cast away all your books of\r\npopery, and in their place substitute the Testament and the Book of\r\nService, and that you read the Scriptures with reverence and fear,\r\ncalling upon God for his grace to direct you in his truth. Pray also\r\nfervently to God, to pardon your former offences, and not to remember\r\nthe sins of your youth, and would you obtain his favour, ever dread to\r\nbreak his laws or offend his majesty. So shall God have you in his\r\nkeeping, and grant you your heart's desire.\" We must honour the memory\r\nof this excellent domestic, whose pious endeavours were equally directed\r\nto benefit the thoughtless youth in this life and that which is to come.\r\nMay her example be followed by the present generation of servants, who\r\nseek rather to seduce by vain dress and loose manners the youth who are\r\nassociated in servitude with them! God did not suffer the wish of this\r\nexcellent domestic to be thrown upon a barren soil; within half a year\r\nafter the licentious Holland became a zealous professor of the gospel,\r\nand was an instrument of conversion to his father and others whom he\r\nvisited in Lancashire, to their spiritual comfort and reformation from\r\npopery.\r\n\r\nHis father, pleased with his change of conduct, gave him forty pounds\r\nto commence business with in London. Upon his return, like an honest\r\nman, he paid the debt of gratitude, and, rightly judging that she who\r\nhad proved so excellent a friend and counsellor, would be no less\r\namiable as a wife, he tendered her his hand. They were married in the\r\nfirst year of Mary, and a child was the fruit of their union, which Mr.\r\nHolland caused to be baptised by Mr. Ross in his own house. For this\r\noffence he was obliged to fly, and Bonner, with his accustomed\r\nimplacability, seized his goods, and ill-treated his wife. After this,\r\nhe remained secretly among the congregations of the faithful, till the\r\nlast year of queen Mary, when he, with six others was taken not far from\r\nSt. John's Wood, and brought to Newgate upon May-day, 1558.\r\n\r\nHe was called before the bishop, Dr. Chedsey, the Harpsfields, &c. Dr.\r\nChedsey expressed much affection for him, and promised he should not\r\nwant any favour that he or his friends could procure, if he would not\r\nfollow his conceit. This was seconded by squire Eaglestone, a gentleman\r\nof Lancashire, and a near kinsman of Holland's, who said, \"I am sure\r\nyour honour means good to my cousin. I beseech God he may have the grace\r\nto follow your counsel.\" Holland directly replied, \"Sir, you crave of\r\nGod you know not what. I beseech of God to open your eyes to see the\r\nlight of his blessed word.\" After some private communication among the\r\ncommissioners, Bonner said, \"I perceive, Roger, you will not be ruled by\r\nany counsel that I or my friends can give.\"\r\n\r\nThe following speech of Mr. Holland we are induced to give unabridged,\r\nas it contains a pointed charge, founded on the sins resulting from\r\nfalse doctrines; and, besides, is in itself a well-digested and just\r\nattack upon the tenets of popery.\r\n\r\n\"I may say to you, my lord, as Paul said to Felix and to the Jews, in\r\nthe 22d of the Acts, and in the 15th of the first epistle to the\r\nCorinthians. It is not unknown to my master, to whom I was apprenticed,\r\nthat I was of your blind religion--that which now is taught, and that I\r\nobstinately and wilfully remained in it, till the latter end of king\r\nEdward. Having liberty under your auricular confession, I made no\r\nconscience of sin, but trusted in the priests' absolution, who for money\r\ndid also some penance for me; which after I had given, I cared no\r\nfarther what offences I did, no more than he did after he had my money,\r\nwhether he tasted bread and water for me, or not: so that lechery,\r\nswearing, and all other vices, I accounted no offence of danger, so long\r\nas I could for money have them absolved. So straitly did I observe your\r\nrules of religion, that I would have ashes upon Ash Wednesday, though I\r\nhad used ever so much wickedness at night. Though I could not in\r\nconscience eat flesh upon the Friday, yet I made no conscience at all of\r\nswearing, drinking, or gaming all night long: thus I was brought up, and\r\nherein I have continued till now of late, when God hath opened the light\r\nof his word, and called me by his grace to repent of my former idolatry\r\nand wicked life; for in Lancashire their blindness and whoredom is much\r\nmore, than may with chaste ears be heard. Yet these my friends, who are\r\nnot clear in these notable crimes, think the priest with his mass can\r\nsave them, though they blaspheme God, and keep concubines besides their\r\nwives, as long as they live. Yea, I know some priests, very devout, my\r\nlord, yet such have six or seven children by four or five sundry women.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Doctor, as to your antiquity, unity, and universality, (for these\r\nDr. Chedsey alleged as notes and tokens of their religion,) I am\r\nunlearned. I have no sophistry to shift my reasons with; but the truth I\r\ntrust I have, which needs no painted colours to set her forth. The\r\nantiquity of our church is not from pope Nicholas, nor pope Joan, but\r\nour church is from the beginning, even from the time that God said unto\r\nAdam, that the seed of the woman should break the serpent's head; and so\r\nto faithful Noah; to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom it was promised,\r\nthat their seed should multiply as the stars in the sky; and so to\r\nMoses, David, and all the holy fathers that were from the beginning unto\r\nthe birth of our Saviour Christ. All who believed these promises were of\r\nthe church, though the number was oftentimes but few and small, as in\r\nElias' days, who thought he was the only one that had not bowed the knee\r\nto Baal, when God had reserved seven thousand that never had bowed their\r\nknees to that idol: as I trust there be seven hundred thousand more than\r\nI know of, that have not bowed their knee to that idol your mass, and\r\nyour God Maozim; in the upholding of which is your bloody cruelty while\r\nyou daily persecute Elias and the servants of God, forcing them (as\r\nDaniel was in his chamber) closely to serve the Lord their God; and even\r\nas we by this your cruelty are forced in the fields to pray unto God,\r\nthat his holy word may be once again truly preached amongst us, and that\r\nhe would mitigate and shorten these idolatrous and bloody days wherein\r\nall cruelty reigns. Moreover, of our church have been the apostles and\r\nevangelists, the martyrs and confessors of Christ, who have at all times\r\nand in all ages been persecuted for the testimony of the word of God.\r\nBut for the upholding of your church and religion, what antiquity can\r\nyou show? The mass indeed, that idol and chief pillar of your religion,\r\nis not yet four hundred years old, and some of your masses are younger,\r\nas that of St. Thomas a Becket, the traitor, wherein you pray, That you\r\nmay be saved by the blood of St. Thomas. And as for your Latin service,\r\nwhat are we of the laity the better for it? I think if any one were to\r\nhear your priests mumble up their service, although he well understood\r\nLatin, yet he would understand very few words of it, the priests so\r\nchamp them and chew them, and post so fast, that they neither understand\r\nwhat they say, nor they that hear them; and in the mean time the people,\r\nwhen they should pray with the priest, are set to their beads to pray\r\nour Lady's Psalter. So crafty is Satan to devise these his dreams,\r\n(which you defend with fagot and fire,) to quench the light of the word\r\nof God; which, as David saith, should be a lantern to our feet. And\r\nagain, Wherein shall a young man direct his way, but by the word of\r\nGod? and yet you will hide it from us in a tongue unknown. St. Paul had\r\nrather have five words spoken with understanding, than ten thousand in\r\nan unknown tongue, and yet will you have your Latin service and praying\r\nin a strange tongue, whereof the people are utterly ignorant, to be of\r\nsuch antiquity.\r\n\r\n\"The Greek church, and a good part of Christendom besides, never\r\nreceived your service in an unknown tongue, but in their own natural\r\nlanguage, which all the people understand; neither your\r\ntransubstantiation, your receiving in one kind, your purgatory, your\r\nimages, &c.\r\n\r\n\"As for the unity which is in your church, what is it but treason,\r\nmurder, poisoning one another, idolatry, superstition, and wickedness?\r\nWhat unity was in your church, when there were three popes at once?\r\nWhere was your head of unity when you had a woman pope?\" Here he was\r\ninterrupted, and was not suffered to proceed. The bishop said his words\r\nwere blasphemous, and ordered the keeper to take him away. Bonner\r\nobserving, on his second examination, that Holland said, he was willing\r\nto be instructed by the church, (meaning the true church,) he ordered\r\nthe keeper to let him want for nothing, not even for money, by which\r\nconduct he hoped to inveigle him from the truth. This, however, upon his\r\nlast examination did not produce the intended effect. Bonner spoke very\r\nhandsomely to him, and assured him his former hasty answers should not\r\noperate against him, as he himself (the bishop) was sometimes too hasty,\r\nbut it was soon over; he further said, that he should have consigned him\r\nto his own ordinary for examination, but for the particular interest he\r\ntook in his welfare, for his and his friends' sake. From this exordium\r\nhe proceeded to the touchstone question of the real presence in the\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not believe, that, after the priest hath spoken the words of\r\nconsecration, there remains the body of Christ, really and corporeally\r\nunder the forms of bread and wine? I mean the self-same body as was born\r\nof the Virgin Mary, that was crucified upon the cross, that rose again\r\nthe third day.\" Holland replied, \"Your lordship saith, the same body\r\nwhich was born of the Virgin Mary, which was crucified upon the cross,\r\nwhich rose again the third day: but you leave out 'which ascended into\r\nheaven;' and the Scripture saith, He shall remain until he come to judge\r\nthe quick and the dead. Then he is not contained under the forms of\r\nbread and wine, by Hoc est corpus meum, &c.\"\r\n\r\nBonner, finding no impression could be made upon his firmness, and that\r\nhe himself could not endure to hear the mass, transubstantiation, and\r\nthe worshipping the sacrament, denominated impious and horrid idolatry,\r\npronounced the condemnatory sentence, adjudging him to be burnt.\r\n\r\nDuring this fulmination, Holland stood very quiet, and when he was about\r\nto depart, he begged permission to speak a few words. The bishop would\r\nnot hear him, but, at the intercession of a friend, he was permitted.\r\nIn the following speech, there is a spirit of prophecy which entitles it\r\nto particular attention; they were not the words of a random enthusiast,\r\nbut of one to whom God seems to have given an assurance, that the\r\npresent abject state of his faithful people should shortly be altered.\r\n\r\n_Holland._ \"Even now I told you that your authority was from God, and by\r\nhis sufferance: and now I tell you God hath heard the voice of his\r\nservants, which hath been poured forth with tears for his afflicted\r\nsaints, whom you daily persecute, as now you do us. But this I dare be\r\nbold in God to say, (by whose Spirit I am moved,) that God will shorten\r\nyour hand of cruelty, that for a time you shall not molest his church.\r\nAnd this you shall in a short time well perceive, my dear brethren, to\r\nbe most true. For _after this day, in this place_, there shall not be\r\nany by him put to the trial of fire and fagot;\" and after that day there\r\nwere none that suffered in Smithfield for the truth of the gospel.\r\n\r\nIn reply, Bonner said, \"Roger, thou art, I perceive, as mad in these thy\r\nheresies as ever was Joan Butcher. In anger and fume thou would become a\r\nrailing prophet. Though thou and all the rest of you would see me\r\nhanged, yet I _shall_ live to burn, yea, and I _will_ burn all the sort\r\nof you that come into my hands, that will not worship the blessed\r\nsacrament of the altar, for all thy prattling;\" and so he went his way.\r\n\r\nThen Holland began to exhort his friends to repentance, and to think\r\nwell of them that suffered for the testimony of the gospel, upon which\r\nthe bishop came back, charging the keeper that no man should speak to\r\nthem without his license; if they did, they should be committed to\r\nprison. In the mean time, Henry Pond and Holland spake to the people,\r\nexhorting them to stand firm in the truth; adding, that God would\r\nshorten these cruel and evil days for his elect's sake.\r\n\r\nThe day they suffered, a proclamation was made, prohibiting every one\r\nfrom speaking or talking to, or receiving any thing from them, or\r\ntouching them, upon pain of imprisonment without either bail or\r\nmainprize. Notwithstanding, the people cried out, \"God strengthen them!\"\r\nThey also prayed for the people, and the restoration of his word.\r\nEmbracing the stake and the reeds, Holland said these words:\r\n\r\n\"Lord, I most humbly thank thy Majesty, that thou hast called me from\r\nthe state of death unto the light of thy heavenly word, and now unto the\r\nfellowship of thy saints, that I may sing and say, Holy, holy, holy,\r\nLord God of Hosts! And, Lord, into thy hands I commit my spirit! Lord,\r\nbless these, thy people, and save them from idolatry.\" Thus he ended his\r\nlife, looking towards heaven, praying to, and praising God, with the\r\nrest of his fellow saints. These seven martyrs were consumed, June 27,\r\n1558.\r\n\r\nThe names of the six martyrs taken in company with those who were\r\napprehended in the close, near Islington, were R. Mills, S. Cotton, R.\r\nDynes, S. Wright, J. Slade, and W. Pikes, tanner. They were condemned by\r\nBonner's chancellor in one day, and the next day a writ was sent to\r\nBrentford for their execution, which took place, July 14, 1558.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flagellations by Bonner._\r\n\r\nWhen this catholic hyena found that neither persuasions, threats, nor\r\nimprisonment, could produce any alteration in the mind of a youth named\r\nThomas Hinshaw, he sent him to Fulham, and during the first night set\r\nhim in the stocks, with no other allowance than bread and water. The\r\nfollowing morning he came to see if this punishment had worked any\r\nchange in his mind, and finding none, he sent Dr. Harpsfield, his\r\narchdeacon, to converse with him. The Doctor was soon out of humour at\r\nhis replies, called him peevish boy, and asked him if he thought he went\r\nabout to damn his soul? \"I am persuaded,\" said Thomas, \"that you labour\r\nto promote the dark kingdom of the devil, not for the love of the\r\ntruth.\" These words the doctor conveyed to the bishop, who, in a passion\r\nthat almost prevented articulation, came to Thomas, and said, \"Dost thou\r\nanswer my archdeacon thus, thou naughty boy? But I'll soon handle thee\r\nwell enough for it, be assured!\" Two willow twigs were then brought him,\r\nand causing the unresisting youth to kneel against a long bench, in an\r\narbour in his garden, he scourged him till he was compelled to cease for\r\nwant of breath and fatigue, being of a punchy and full-bellied make. One\r\nof the rods was worn quite away.\r\n\r\nMany other conflicts did Hinshaw undergo from the bishop; who, at\r\nlength, to remove him effectually, procured false witnesses to lay\r\narticles against him, all of which the young man denied, and, in short,\r\nrefused to answer to any interrogatories administered to him. A\r\nfortnight after this, the young man was attacked by a burning ague, and\r\nat the request of his master, Mr. Pugson, of St. Paul's church-yard, he\r\nwas removed, the bishop not doubting that he had given him his death in\r\nthe natural way; he however remained ill above a year, and in the mean\r\ntime queen Mary died, by which act of providence he escaped Bonner's\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nJohn Willes was another faithful person, on whom the scourging hand of\r\nBonner fell. He was the brother of Richard Willes, before mentioned,\r\nburnt at Brentford. Hinshaw and Willes were confined in Bonner's coal\r\nhouse together, and afterward removed to Fulham, where he and Hinshaw\r\nremained during eight or ten days, in the stocks. Bonner's persecuting\r\nspirit betrayed itself in his treatment of Willes during his\r\nexaminations, often striking him on the head with a stick, seizing him\r\nby the ears, and filipping him under the chin, saying he held down his\r\nhead like a thief. This producing no signs of recantation, he took him\r\ninto his orchard, and in a small arbour there he flogged him first with\r\na willow rod, and then with birch, till he was exhausted. This cruel\r\nferocity arose from the answer of the poor sufferer, who, upon being\r\nasked how long it was since he had crept to the cross, replied, \"Not\r\nsince he had come to years of discretion, nor would he, though he\r\nshould be torn to pieces by wild horses.\" Bonner then bade him make the\r\nsign of the cross on his forehead, which he refused to do, and thus was\r\nled to the orchard.\r\n\r\nThe communications that took place between Bonner and Willes are too\r\ntedious to give in detail. The reader would smile to read the infatuated\r\nsimple reasons with which the bishop endeavoured to delude the ignorant.\r\nHe strongly urged the impropriety of his meddling with matters of\r\nscripture; adding, \"If thou wilt believe Luther, Zuinglius, and other\r\nprotestant authors, thou canst not go right; but in believing me, there\r\ncan be no error!--and, if there be, thy blood will be required at our\r\nhands. In following Luther, and the heretics of latter days, now wilt\r\nthou come to the place thou askest for?--They will lead thee to\r\ndestruction, and burn thy body and soul in hell, like all those who have\r\nbeen burnt in Smithfield.\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop continued to afflict him in his examinations, in which, among\r\nother things, he said, \"They call me bloody Bonner!--A vengeance on you\r\nall! I would fain be rid of you, but you have a delight in burning.\r\nCould I have my will, I would sew up your mouths, put you in sacks, and\r\ndrown you!\"\r\n\r\nWhat a sanguinary speech was this, to proceed from the mouth of one who\r\nprofessed to be a minister of the gospel of peace, and a servant of the\r\nLamb of God!--Can we have an assurance that the same spirit does not\r\nreign now, which reigned in this mitred catholic?\r\n\r\nOne day, when in the stocks, Bonner asked him how he liked his lodging\r\nand fare. \"Well enough,\" said Willes, \"might I have a little straw to\r\nsit or lie upon.\" Just at this time came in Willes' wife, then largely\r\npregnant, and entreated the bishop for her husband, boldly declaring\r\nthat she would be delivered in the house, if he were not suffered to go\r\nwith her. To get rid of the good wife's importunity, and the trouble of\r\na lying-in woman in his palace, he bade Willes make the sign of the\r\ncross, and say, In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.\r\nWilles omitted the sign, and repeated the words, \"in the name of the\r\nFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.\" Bonner would have\r\nthe words repeated in Latin, to which Willes made no objection, knowing\r\nthe meaning of the words. He was then permitted to go home with his\r\nwife, his kinsman Robert Rouze being charged to bring him to St. Paul's\r\nthe next day, whither he himself went, and, subscribing to a Latin\r\ninstrument of little importance, was liberated. This is the last of the\r\ntwenty-two taken at Islington.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rev. Richard Yeoman._\r\n\r\nThis devout aged person was curate to Dr. Taylor, at Hadley, and\r\neminently qualified for his sacred function. Dr. Taylor left him the\r\ncuracy at his departure, but no sooner had Mr. Newall gotten the\r\nbenefice, than he removed Mr. Yeoman, and substituted a Romish priest.\r\nAfter this he wandered from place to place, exhorting all men to stand\r\nfaithfully to God's word, earnestly to give themselves unto prayer, with\r\npatience to bear the cross now laid upon them for their trial, with\r\nboldness to confess the truth before their adversaries, and with an\r\nundoubted hope to wait for the crown and reward of eternal felicity. But\r\nwhen he perceived his adversaries lay wait for him, he went into Kent,\r\nand with a little packet of laces, pins, points, &c. he travelled from\r\nvillage to village, selling such things, and in this manner subsisted\r\nhimself, his wife, and children.\r\n\r\nAt last Justice Moile, of Kent, took Mr. Yeoman, and set him in the\r\nstocks a day and a night; but, having no evident matter to charge him\r\nwith, he let him go again. Coming secretly again to Hadley, he tarried\r\nwith his poor wife, who kept him privately, in a chamber of the\r\ntown-house, commonly called the Guildhall, more than a year. During this\r\ntime the good old father abode in a chamber locked up all the day,\r\nspending his time in devout prayer, in reading the Scriptures, and in\r\ncarding the wool which his wife spun. His wife also begged bread for\r\nherself and her children, by which precarious means they supported\r\nthemselves. Thus the saints of God sustained hunger and misery, while\r\nthe prophets of Baal lived in festivity, and were costily pampered at\r\nJezebel's table.\r\n\r\nInformation being at length given to Newall, that Yeoman was secreted by\r\nhis wife, he came, attended by the constables, and broke into the room\r\nwhere the object of his search lay in bed with his wife. He reproached\r\nthe poor woman with being a whore, and would have indecently pulled the\r\nclothes off, but Yeoman resisted both this act of violence and the\r\nattack upon his wife's character, adding that he defied the pope and\r\npopery. He was then taken out, and set in the stocks till day.\r\n\r\nIn the cage also with him was an old man, named John Dale, who had sat\r\nthere three or four days, for exhorting the people during the time\r\nservice was performing by Newall and his curate. His words were, \"O\r\nmiserable and blind guides, will ye ever be blind leaders of the blind?\r\nwill ye never amend? will ye never see the truth of God's word? will\r\nneither God's threats nor promises enter into your hearts? will the\r\nblood of the martyrs nothing mollify your stony stomachs? O obdurate,\r\nhard-hearted, perverse, and crooked generation! to whom nothing can do\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nThese words he spake in fervency of spirit against the superstitious\r\nreligion of Rome; wherefore parson Newall caused him forthwith to be\r\nattached, and set in the stocks in a cage, where he was kept till Sir\r\nHenry Doile, a justice, came to Hadley.\r\n\r\nWhen Yeoman was taken, the parson called earnestly upon Sir Henry Doile\r\nto send them both to prison. Sir Henry Doile as earnestly entreated the\r\nparson to consider the age of the men, and their mean condition; they\r\nwere neither persons of note nor preachers; wherefore he proposed to let\r\nthem be punished a day or two and to dismiss them, at least John Dale,\r\nwho was no priest, and therefore, as he had so long sat in the cage, he\r\nthought it punishment enough for this time. When the parson heard this,\r\nhe was exceedingly mad, and in a great rage called them pestilent\r\nheretics, unfit to live in the commonwealth of Christians. Sir Henry,\r\nfearing to appear too merciful, Yeoman and Dale were pinioned, bound\r\nlike thieves with their legs under the horses' bellies, and carried to\r\nBury jail, where they were laid in irons; and because they continually\r\nrebuked popery, they were carried into the lowest dungeon, where John\r\nDale, through the jail-sickness and evil-keeping, died soon after: his\r\nbody was thrown out, and buried in the fields. He was a man of sixty-six\r\nyears of age, a weaver by occupation, well learned in the holy\r\nScriptures, steadfast in his confession of the true doctrines of Christ\r\nas set forth in king Edward's time; for which he joyfully suffered\r\nprison and chains, and from this worldly dungeon he departed in Christ\r\nto eternal glory, and the blessed paradise of everlasting felicity.\r\n\r\nAfter Dale's death, Yeoman was removed to Norwich prison, where, after\r\nstrait and evil keeping, he was examined upon his faith and religion,\r\nand required to submit himself to his holy father the pope. \"I defy him,\r\n(quoth he,) and all his detestable abomination: I will in no wise have\r\nto do with him.\" The chief articles objected to him, were his marriage\r\nand the mass sacrifice. Finding he continued steadfast in the truth, he\r\nwas condemned, degraded, and not only burnt, but most cruelly tormented\r\nin the fire. Thus he ended this poor and miserable life, and entered\r\ninto that blessed bosom of Abraham, enjoying with Lazarus that rest\r\nwhich God has prepared for his elect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Benbridge._\r\n\r\nMr. Benbridge was a single gentleman, in the diocese of Winchester. He\r\nmight have lived a gentleman's life, in the wealthy possessions of this\r\nworld; but he chose rather to enter through the strait gate of\r\npersecution to the heavenly possession of life in the Lord's kingdom,\r\nthan to enjoy present pleasure with disquietude of conscience. Manfully\r\nstanding against the papists for the defence of the sincere doctrine of\r\nChrist's gospel, he was apprehended as an adversary to the Romish\r\nreligion, and led for examination before the bishop of Winchester, where\r\nhe underwent several conflicts for the truth against the bishop and his\r\ncolleague; for which he was condemned, and some time after brought to\r\nthe place of martyrdom by Sir Richard Pecksal, sheriff.\r\n\r\nWhen standing at the stake he began to untie his points, and to prepare\r\nhimself; then he gave his gown to the keeper, by way of fee. His jerkin\r\nwas trimmed with gold lace, which he gave to Sir Richard Pecksal, the\r\nhigh sheriff. His cap of velvet he took from his head, and threw away.\r\nThen, lifting his mind to the Lord, he engaged in prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen fastened to the stake, Dr. Seaton begged him to recant, and he\r\nshould have his pardon; but when he saw that nothing availed, he told\r\nthe people not to pray for him unless he would recant, no more than they\r\nwould pray for a dog.\r\n\r\nMr. Benbridge, standing at the stake with his hands together in such a\r\nmanner as the priest holds his hands in his Memento, Dr. Seaton came to\r\nhim again, and exhorted him to recant, to whom he said, \"Away, Babylon,\r\naway!\" One that stood by said, Sir, cut his tongue out; another, a\r\ntemporal man, railed at him worse than Dr. Seaton had done.\r\n\r\nWhen they saw he would not yield, they bade the tormentors to light the\r\npile, before he was in any way covered with fagots. The fire first took\r\naway a piece of his beard, at which he did not shrink. Then it came on\r\nthe other side and took his legs, and the nether stockings of his hose\r\nbeing leather, they made the fire pierce the sharper, so that the\r\nintolerable heat made him exclaim, \"I recant!\" and suddenly he thrust\r\nthe fire from him. Two or three of his friends being by, wished to save\r\nhim; they stepped to the fire to help remove it, for which kindness they\r\nwere sent to jail. The sheriff also of his own authority took him from\r\nthe stake, and remitted him to prison, for which he was sent to the\r\nfleet, and lay there sometime. Before, however, he was taken from the\r\nstake, Dr. Seaton wrote articles for him to subscribe to. To these Mr.\r\nBenbridge made so many objections, that Dr. Seaton ordered them to set\r\nfire again to the pile. Then with much pain and grief of heart he\r\nsubscribed to them upon a man's back.\r\n\r\nThis done, his gown was given him again, and he was led to prison. While\r\nthere, he wrote a letter to Dr. Seaton, recanting those words he spake\r\nat the stake, and the articles which he had subscribed; for he was\r\ngrieved that he had ever signed them. The same day se'night he was again\r\nbrought to the stake, where the vile tormentors rather broiled than\r\nburnt him. The Lord give his enemies repentance!\r\n\r\nNot long before the sickness of queen Mary, in the beginning of August,\r\n1558, four inoffensive humble martyrs were burnt at St. Edmundsbury with\r\nvery little examination. Neglect in attending the popish service at\r\nmass, which in vain they pleaded as a matter of conscience, was the\r\ncause of their untimely sufferings and deaths. Their heroic names were\r\nJ. Crooke, sawyer; R. Miles, alias Plummer, sheerman; A. Lane,\r\nwheelright; and J. Ashley, a bachelor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alexander Gouch and Alice Driver._\r\n\r\nThese godly persons were apprehended by Mr. Noone, a justice in Suffolk.\r\n\r\nThey were brought to the stake at seven o'clock in the morning,\r\nnotwithstanding they had come from Melton jail, six miles off. The\r\nsheriff, Sir Henry Dowell, was much dissatisfied with the time they took\r\nin prayer, and sent one of his men to bid them make an end. Gouch\r\nearnestly entreated for a little time, urging that they had but a little\r\nwhile to live: but the sheriff would grant no indulgence, and ordered\r\nthe numerous friends who came to take the last farewell of them as they\r\nstood chained to the stake, to be forcibly torn away, and threatened\r\nthem with arrest; but the indignation of the spectators made him revoke\r\nthis order. They endured the terrific conflagration, and honoured God\r\nequally in their lives and deaths.\r\n\r\nIn the same month were executed at Bury, P. Humphrey, and J. and H.\r\nDavid, brothers. Sir Clement Higham, about a fortnight before the\r\nqueen's death, issued out a warrant for their sacrifice, notwithstanding\r\nthe queen's illness at that time rendered her incapable of signing the\r\norder for their execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Prest._\r\n\r\nFrom the number condemned in this fanatical reign, it is almost\r\nimpossible to obtain the name of every martyr, or to embellish the\r\nhistory of all with anecdotes and exemplifications of Christian conduct.\r\nThanks be to Providence, our cruel task begins to draw towards a\r\nconclusion, with the end of the reign of Papal terror and bloodshed.\r\nMonarchs, sit upon thrones possessed by hereditary right, should, of all\r\nothers, consider that the laws of nature are the laws of God, and hence\r\nthat the first law of nature is the preservation of their subjects.\r\nMaxims of persecutions, of torture, and of death, they should leave to\r\nthose who have effected sovereignty by fraud or the sword; but where,\r\nexcept among a few miscreant emperors of Rome, and the Roman pontiffs,\r\nshall we find one whose memory is so \"damned to everlasting fame\" as\r\nthat of queen Mary? Nations bewail the hour which separates them forever\r\nfrom a beloved governor, but, with respect to that of Mary, it was the\r\nmost blessed time of her whole reign. Heaven has ordained three great\r\nscourges for national sins--plague, pestilence, and famine. It was the\r\nwill of God in Mary's reign to bring a fourth upon this kingdom, under\r\nthe form of Papistical Persecution. It was sharp, but glorious; the fire\r\nwhich consumed the martyrs has undermined the Popedom; and the Catholic\r\nstates, at present the most bigoted and unenlightened, are those which\r\nare sunk lowest in the scale of moral dignity and political consequence.\r\nMay they remain so, till the pure light of the gospel shall dissipate\r\nthe darkness of fanaticism and superstition! But to return.\r\n\r\nMrs. Prest for some time lived about Cornwall, where she had a husband\r\nand children, whose bigotry compelled her to frequent the abominations\r\nof the church of Rome. Resolving to act as her conscience dictated, she\r\nquitted them, and made a living by spinning. After some time, returning\r\nhome, she was accused by her neighbours, and brought to Exeter, to be\r\nexamined before Dr. Troubleville, and his chancellor Blackston. As this\r\nmartyr was accounted of inferior intellects, we shall put her in\r\ncompetition with the bishop, and let the reader judge which had the most\r\nof that knowledge conducive to everlasting life. The bishop bringing the\r\nquestion to issue, respecting the bread and wine being flesh and blood,\r\nMrs. Prest said, \"I will demand of you whether you can deny your creed,\r\nwhich says, that Christ doth perpetually sit at the right hand of his\r\nFather, both body and soul, until he come again; or whether he be there\r\nin heaven our Advocate, and to make prayer for us unto God his Father?\r\nIf he be so, he is not here on earth in a piece of bread. If he be not\r\nhere, and if he do not dwell in temples made with hands, but in heaven,\r\nwhat! shall we seek him here? If he did not offer his body once for all,\r\nwhy make you a new offering? If with one offering he made all perfect,\r\nwhy do you with a false offering make all imperfect? If he be to be\r\nworshipped in spirit and in truth, why do you worship a piece of bread?\r\nIf he be eaten and drunken in faith and truth, if his flesh be not\r\nprofitable to be among us, why do you say you make his flesh and blood,\r\nand say it is profitable for body and soul? Alas! I am a poor woman, but\r\nrather than do as you do, I would live no longer. I have said, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n_Bishop._ I promise you, you are a jolly protestant. I pray you in what\r\nschool have you been brought up?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Prest._ I have upon the Sundays visited the sermons, and there\r\nhave I learned such things as are so fixed in my breast, that death\r\nshall not separate them.\r\n\r\n_B._ O foolish woman, who will waste his breath upon thee, or such as\r\nthou art? But how chanceth it that thou wentest away from thy husband?\r\nIf thou wert an honest woman, thou wouldst not have left thy husband and\r\nchildren, and run about the country like a fugitive.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. P._ Sir, I laboured for my living; and as my master Christ\r\ncounselleth me, when I was persecuted in one city, I fled into another.\r\n\r\n_B._ Who persecuted thee?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. P._ My husband and my children. For when I would have them to\r\nleave idolatry, and to worship God in heaven, he would not hear me, but\r\nhe with his children rebuked me, and troubled me. I fled not for\r\nwhoredom, nor for theft, but because I would be no partaker with him and\r\nhis of that foul idol the mass; and wheresoever I was, as oft as I\r\ncould, upon Sundays and holydays, I made excuses not to go to the popish\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n_B._ Belike then you are a good housewife, to fly from your husband and\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. P._ My housewifery is but small; but God gave me grace to go to\r\nthe true church.\r\n\r\n_B._ The true church, what dost thou mean?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. P._ Not your popish church, full of idols and abominations, but\r\nwhere two or three are gathered together in the name of God, to that\r\nchurch will I go as long as I live.\r\n\r\n_B._ Belike then you have a church of your own. Well, let this mad woman\r\nbe put down to prison till we send for her husband.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. P._ No, I have but one husband, who is here already in this city,\r\nand in prison with me, from whom I will never depart.\r\n\r\nSome persons present endeavouring to convince the bishop she was not in\r\nher right senses, she was permitted to depart. The keeper of the\r\nbishop's prisons took her into his house, where she either spun worked\r\nas a servant, or walked about the city, discoursing upon the sacrament\r\nof the altar. Her husband was sent for to take her home, but this she\r\nrefused while the cause of religion could be served. She was too active\r\nto be idle, and her conversation, simple as they affected to think her,\r\nexcited the attention of several catholic priests and friars. They\r\nteazed her with questions, till she answered them angrily, and this\r\nexcited a laugh at her warmth.\r\n\r\nNay, said she, you have more need to weep than to laugh, and to be sorry\r\nthat ever you were born, to be the chaplains of that whore of Babylon. I\r\ndefy him and all his falsehood; and get you away from me, you do but\r\ntrouble my conscience. You would have me follow your doings; I will\r\nfirst lose my life. I pray you depart.\r\n\r\nWhy, thou foolish woman, said they, we come to thee for thy profit and\r\nsoul's health. To which she replied, What profit ariseth by you, that\r\nteach nothing but lies for truth? how save you souls, when you preach\r\nnothing but lies, and destroy souls?\r\n\r\nHow provest thou that? said they.\r\n\r\nDo you not destroy your souls, when you teach the people to worship\r\nidols, stocks and stones, the works of men's hands? and to worship a\r\nfalse God of your own making of a piece of bread, and teach that the\r\npope is God's vicar, and hath power to forgive sins? and that there is a\r\npurgatory, when God's Son hath by his passion purged all? and say you\r\nmake God, and sacrifice him, when Christ's body was a sacrifice once for\r\nall? Do you not teach the people to number their sins in your ears, and\r\nsay they will be damned if they confess not all; when God's word saith,\r\nWho can number his sins? Do you not promise them trentals and dirges,\r\nand masses for souls, and sell your prayers for money, and make them buy\r\npardons, and trust to such foolish inventions of your imaginations? Do\r\nyou not altogether act against God? Do you not teach us to pray upon\r\nbeads, and to pray unto saints, and say they can pray for us? Do you not\r\nmake holy water and holy bread to fray devils? Do you not do a thousand\r\nmore abominations? And yet you say, you come for my profit, and to save\r\nmy soul. No, no, one hath saved me. Farewell, you with your salvation.\r\n\r\nDuring the liberty granted her by the bishop, before-mentioned, she went\r\ninto St. Peter's church, and there found a skilful Dutchman, who was\r\naffixing new noses to certain fine images which had been disfigured in\r\nking Edward's time; to whom she said, What a madman art thou, to make\r\nthem new noses, which within a few days shall all lose their heads? The\r\nDutchman accused her and laid it hard to her change. And she said unto\r\nhim, Thou are accursed, and so are thy images. He called her a whore.\r\nNay, said she, thy images are whores, and thou art a whore-hunter; for\r\ndoth not God say, You go a whoring after strange gods, figures of your\r\nown making? and thou art one of them. After this she was ordered to be\r\nconfined, and had no more liberty.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of her imprisonment, many visited her, some sent by the\r\nbishop, and some of their own will; among these was one Daniel, a great\r\npreacher of the gospel, in the days of king Edward, about Cornwall and\r\nDevonshire, but who, through the grievous persecution he had sustained,\r\nhad fallen off. Earnestly did she exhort him to repent with Peter, and\r\nto be more constant in his profession.\r\n\r\nMrs. Walter Rauley and Mr. Wm. and John Kede, persons of great\r\nrespectability, bore ample testimony of her godly conversation,\r\ndeclaring, that unless God were with her, it were impossible she could\r\nhave so ably defended the cause of Christ. Indeed, to sum up the\r\ncharacter of this poor woman, she united the serpent and the dove,\r\nabounding in the highest wisdom joined to the greatest simplicity. She\r\nendured imprisonment, threatenings, taunts, and the vilest epithets, but\r\nnothing could induce her to swerve; her heart was fixed; she had cast\r\nanchor; nor could all the wounds of persecution remove her from the rock\r\non which her hopes of felicity were built.\r\n\r\nSuch was her memory, that, without learning, she could tell in what\r\nchapter any text of scripture was contained: on account of this singular\r\nproperty, one Gregory Basset, a rank papist, said she was deranged, and\r\ntalked as a parrot, wild without meaning. At length, having tried every\r\nmanner without effect to make her nominally a catholic, they condemned\r\nher. After this, one exhorted her to leave her opinions, and go home to\r\nher family, as she was poor and illiterate. \"True, (said she) though I\r\nam not learned, I am content to be a witness of Christ's death, and I\r\npray you make no longer delay with me; for my heart is fixed, and I will\r\nnever say otherwise, nor turn to your superstitious doing.\"\r\n\r\nTo the disgrace of Mr. Blackston, treasurer of the church, he would\r\noften send for this poor martyr from prison, to make sport for him and a\r\nwoman whom he kept; putting religious questions to her, and turning her\r\nanswers into ridicule. This done, he sent her back to her wretched\r\ndungeon, while he battened upon the good things of this world.\r\n\r\nThere was perhaps something simply ludicrous in the form of Mrs. Prest,\r\nas she was of a very short stature, thick set, and about fifty-four\r\nyears of age; but her countenance was cheerful and lively, as if\r\nprepared for the day of her marriage with the Lamb. To mock at her form\r\nwas an indirect accusation of her Creator, who framed her after the\r\nfashion he liked best, and gave her a mind that far excelled the\r\ntransient endowments of perishable flesh. When she was offered money,\r\nshe rejected it, \"because (said she) I am going to a city where money\r\nbears no mastery, and while I am here God has promised to feed me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen sentence was read, condemning her to the flames, she lifted up her\r\nvoice and praised God, adding, \"This day have I found that which I have\r\nlong sought.\" When they tempted her to recant,--\"That will I not, (said\r\nshe) God forbid that I should lose the life eternal, for this carnal and\r\nshort life. I will never turn from my heavenly husband to my earthly\r\nhusband; from the fellowship of angels to mortal children; and if my\r\nhusband and children be faithful, then am I theirs. God is my father,\r\nGod is my mother, God is my sister, my brother, my kinsman; God is my\r\nfriend, most faithful.\"\r\n\r\nBeing delivered to the sheriff, she was led by the officer to the place\r\nof execution, without the walls of Exeter, called Sothenhey, where again\r\nthe superstitious priests assaulted her. While they were tying her to\r\nthe stake, she continued earnestly to exclaim \"God be merciful to me, a\r\nsinner!\" Patiently enduring the devouring conflagration, she was\r\nconsumed to ashes, and thus ended a life which in unshaken fidelity to\r\nthe cause of Christ, was not surpassed by that of any preceding martyr.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Richard Sharpe, Thomas Banion, and Thomas Hale._\r\n\r\nMr. Sharpe, weaver, of Bristol, was brought the 9th day of March, 1556,\r\nbefore Mr. Dalby, chancellor of the city of Bristol, and after\r\nexamination concerning the sacrament of the altar, was persuaded to\r\nrecant; and on the 29th, he was enjoined to make his recantation in the\r\nparish church. But, scarcely had he publicly avowed his backsliding,\r\nbefore he felt in his conscience such a tormenting fiend, that he was\r\nunable to work at his occupation; hence, shortly after, one Sunday, he\r\ncame into the parish church, called Temple, and after high mass, stood\r\nup in the choir door, and said with a loud voice, \"Neighbours, bear me\r\nrecord that yonder idol (pointing to the altar) is the greatest and most\r\nabominable that ever was; and I am sorry that ever I denied my Lord\r\nGod!\" Notwithstanding the constables were ordered to apprehend him, he\r\nwas suffered to go out of the church; but at night he was apprehended\r\nand carried to Newgate. Shortly after, before the chancellor, denying\r\nthe sacrament of the altar to be the body and blood of Christ, he was\r\ncondemned to be burned by Mr. Dalby. He was burnt the 7th of May, 1558,\r\nand died godly, patiently, and constantly, confessing the protestant\r\narticles of faith.\r\n\r\nWith him suffered Thomas Hale, shoemaker, of Bristol, who was condemned\r\nby chancellor Dalby. These martyrs were bound back to back.\r\n\r\nThomas Banion, a weaver, was burnt on August 27th, of the same year, and\r\ndied for the sake of the evangelical cause of his Saviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_J. Corneford, of Wortham; C. Browne, of Maidstone; J. Herst, of\r\nAshford; Alice Snoth, and Catharine Knight, an aged woman._\r\n\r\nWith pleasure we have to record that these five martyrs were the last\r\nwho suffered in the reign of Mary for the sake of the protestant cause;\r\nbut the malice of the papists was conspicuous in hastening their\r\nmartyrdom, which might have been delayed till the event of the queen's\r\nillness was decided. It is reported that the archdeacon of Canterbury,\r\njudging that the sudden death of the queen would suspend the execution,\r\ntravelled post from London, to have the satisfaction of adding another\r\npage to the black list of papistical sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe articles against them were, as usual, the sacramental elements and\r\nthe idolatry of bending to images. They quoted St. John's words, \"Beware\r\nof images!\" and respecting the real presence, they urged according to\r\nSt. Paul, \"the things that be seen are temporal.\" When sentence was\r\nabout to be read against them, and excommunication take place in the\r\nregular form, John Corneford, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, awfully\r\nturned the latter proceeding against themselves, and in a solemn\r\nimpressive manner, recriminated their excommunication in the following\r\nwords: \"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the most mighty\r\nGod, and by the power of his holy Spirit, and the authority of his holy\r\ncatholic and apostolic church, we do here give into the hands of Satan\r\nto be destroyed, the bodies of all those blasphemers and heretics that\r\nmaintain any error against his most holy word, or do condemn his most\r\nholy truth for heresy, to the maintenance of any false church or foreign\r\nreligion, so that by this thy just judgment, O most mighty God, against\r\nthy adversaries, thy true religion may be known to thy great glory and\r\nour comfort and to the edifying of all our nation. Good Lord, so be it.\r\nAmen.\"\r\n\r\nThis sentence was openly pronounced and registered, and, as if\r\nProvidence had awarded that it should not be delivered in vain, within\r\nsix days after, queen Mary died, detested by all good men and accursed\r\nof God! Though acquainted with these circumstances, the archdeacon's\r\nimplacability exceeded that of his great exemplary, Bonner, who, though\r\nhe had several persons at that time under his fiery grasp, did not urge\r\ntheir deaths hastily, by which delay he certainly afforded them an\r\nopportunity of escape. Father Lining and his wife, with several others,\r\nthus saved their lives, who, had they been under the barbarous\r\narchdeacon, must inevitably have perished. At the queen's decease, many\r\nwere in bonds: some just taken, some examined, and others condemned. The\r\nwrits indeed were issued for several burnings, but by the death of the\r\nthree instigators of protestant murder,--the chancellor, the bishop, and\r\nthe queen, who fell nearly together, the condemned sheep were liberated,\r\nand lived many years to praise God for their happy deliverance.\r\n\r\nThese five martyrs, when at the stake, earnestly prayed that their blood\r\nmight be the last shed, nor did they pray in vain. They died gloriously,\r\nand perfected the number God had selected to hear witness of the truth\r\nin this dreadful reign, whose names are recorded in the Book of\r\nLife;--though last, not least among the saints made meet for immortality\r\nthrough the redeeming blood of the Lamb!\r\n\r\nCatharine Finlay, alias Knight, was first converted by her son's\r\nexpounding the Scriptures to her, which wrought in her a perfect work\r\nthat terminated in martyrdom. Alice Snoth at the stake sent for her\r\ngrandmother and godfather, and rehearsed to them the articles of her\r\nfaith, and the commandments of God, thereby convincing the world that\r\nshe knew her duty. She died calling upon the spectators to bear witness\r\nthat she was a Christian woman, and suffered joyfully for the testimony\r\nof Christ's gospel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Fetty scourged to death._\r\n\r\nAmong the numberless enormities committed by the merciless and unfeeling\r\nBonner, the murder of this innocent and unoffending child may be ranked\r\nas the most horrid. His father, John Fetty, of the parish of\r\nClerkenwell, by trade a tailor, and only twenty-four years of age, had\r\nmade a blessed election; he was fixed secure in eternal hope, and\r\ndepended on Him who so builds his church that the gates of hell shall\r\nnot prevail against it. But alas! the very wife of his bosom, whose\r\nheart was hardened against the truth, and whose mind was influenced by\r\nthe teachers of false doctrine, became his accuser. Brokenbery, a\r\ncreature of the pope, and parson of the parish, received the information\r\nof this wedded Delilah, in consequence of which the poor man was\r\napprehended. But here the awful judgment of an ever-righteous God, \"who\r\nis of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,\" fell upon this stone-hearted\r\nand perfidious woman; for no sooner was the injured husband captured by\r\nher wicked contriving, than she also was suddenly seized with madness,\r\nand exhibited an awful and awakening instance of God's power to punish\r\nthe evil doer. This dreadful circumstance had some effect upon the\r\nhearts of the ungodly hunters who had eagerly grasped their prey; but,\r\nin a relenting moment, they suffered him to remain with his unworthy\r\nwife, to return her good for evil, and to comfort two children, who, on\r\nhis being sent to prison, would have been left without a protector, or\r\nhave become a burden to the parish. As bad men act from little motives,\r\nwe may place the indulgence shown him to the latter account.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed in the former part of our narratives of the martyrs,\r\nsome whose affection would have led them even to sacrifice their own\r\nlives, to preserve their husbands; but here, agreeable to Scripture\r\nlanguage, a mother proves, indeed, a monster in nature! Neither conjugal\r\nnor maternal affection could impress the heart of this disgraceful\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nAlthough our afflicted Christian had experienced so much cruelty and\r\nfalsehood from the woman who was bound to him by every tie, both human\r\nand divine, yet, with a mild and forbearing spirit, he overlooked her\r\nmisdeeds, during her calamity endeavouring all he could to procure\r\nrelief for her malady, and soothing her by every possible expression of\r\ntenderness: thus she became in a few weeks nearly restored to her\r\nsenses. But, alas! she returned again to her sin, \"as the dog returneth\r\nto his vomit.\" Malice against the saints of the Most High was seated in\r\nher heart too firmly to be removed; and as her strength returned, her\r\ninclination to work wickedness returned with it. Her heart was hardened\r\nby the prince of darkness; and to her may be applied these afflicting\r\nand soul-harrowing words, \"can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the\r\nleopard his spots? then will they do good who are accustomed to do\r\nevil.\" Weighing this text duly with another, \"I will have mercy on whom\r\nI will have mercy,\" how shall we presume to refine away the sovereignty\r\nof God, by arraigning Jehovah at the bar of human reason, which, in\r\nreligious matters, is too often opposed by infinite wisdom? \"Broad is\r\nthe way which leadeth to death, and many walk therein. Narrow is the way\r\nwhich leadeth to life, and few there be who find it.\" The ways of heaven\r\nare indeed inscrutable, and it is our bounden duty to walk ever\r\ndependent on God, looking up to him with humble confidence, and hope in\r\nhis goodness, and ever confess his justice; and where we \"cannot\r\nunravel, there learn to trust.\" This wretched woman, pursuing the horrid\r\ndictates of a heart hardened and depraved, was scarcely confirmed in her\r\nrecovery, when, stifling the dictates of honour, gratitude, and every\r\nnatural affection, she again accused her husband, who was once more\r\napprehended, and taken before Sir John Mordant, Knight, and one of queen\r\nMary's commissioners.\r\n\r\nUpon examination, his judge finding him fixed to opinions which\r\nmilitated against those nursed by superstition and maintained by cruelty\r\nhe was sentenced to confinement and torture in Lollard's Tower. \"Here\r\n(says honest Fox) he was put into the painful stocks, and had a dish of\r\nwater set by him, with a stone put into it, to what purpose God knoweth,\r\nexcept it were to show that he should look for little other subsistence:\r\nwhich is credible enough, if we consider their like practices upon\r\ndivers before mentioned in this history; as, among others, upon Richard\r\nSmith, who died through their cruel imprisonment; touching whom, when a\r\ngodly woman came to Dr. Story to have leave that she might bury him, he\r\nasked her if he had any straw or blood in his mouth; but what he means\r\nthereby, I leave to the judgment of the wise.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the third week of our martyr's sufferings, an object\r\npresented itself to his view, which made him indeed feel his tortures\r\nwith all their force, and to execrate, with bitterness only short of\r\ncursing, the author of his misery. To mark and punish the proceedings of\r\nhis tormentors, remained with the Most High, who noteth even the fall of\r\na sparrow, and in whose sacred word it is written, \"Vengeance is mine,\r\nand I will repay.\" This object was his own son, a child of the tender\r\nage of eight years. For fifteen days, had its hapless father been\r\nsuspended by his tormentor by the right arm and left leg, and sometimes\r\nby both, shifting his positions for the purpose of giving him strength\r\nto bear and to lengthen the date of his sufferings. When the unoffending\r\ninnocent, desirous of seeing and speaking to its parent, applied to\r\nBonner for permission so to do, the poor child being asked by the\r\nbishop's chaplain the purport of his errand, he replied, he wished to\r\nsee his father. \"Who is thy father?\" said the chaplain. \"John Fetty,\"\r\nreturned the boy, at the same time pointing to the place where he was\r\nconfined. The interrogating miscreant on this said, \"Why, thy father is\r\na heretic!\" The little champion again rejoined, with energy sufficient\r\nto raise admiration in any breast, except that of this unprincipled and\r\nunfeeling wretch--this miscreant, eager to execute the behests of a\r\nremorseless queen--\"My father is no heretic: for you have Balaam's\r\nmark.\"\r\n\r\nIrritated by reproach so aptly applied, the indignant and mortified\r\npriest concealed his resentment for a moment, and took the undaunted boy\r\ninto the house, where, having him secure, he presented him to others,\r\nwhose baseness and cruelty being equal to his own, they stripped him to\r\nthe skin, and applied their scourges to so violent a degree, that,\r\nfainting beneath the stripes inflicted on his tender frame, and covered\r\nwith the blood that flowed from them, the victim of their ungodly wrath\r\nwas ready to expire under his heavy and unmerited punishment.\r\n\r\nIn this bleeding and helpless state was the suffering infant, covered\r\nonly with his shirt, taken to his father by one of the actors in the\r\nhorrid tragedy, who, while he exhibited the heart-rending spectacle,\r\nmade use of the vilest taunts, and exulted in what he had done. The\r\ndutiful child, as if recovering strength at the sight of his father, on\r\nhis knees implored his blessing. \"Alas! Will,\" said the afflicted\r\nparent, in trembling amazement, \"who hath done this to thee!\" The\r\nartless innocent related the circumstances that led to the merciless\r\ncorrection which had been so basely inflicted on him; but when he\r\nrepeated the reproof bestowed on the chaplain, and which was prompted by\r\nan undaunted spirit, he was torn from his weeping parent, and conveyed\r\nagain to the house, where he remained a close prisoner.\r\n\r\nBonner, somewhat fearful that what had been done could not be justified\r\neven among the bloodhounds of his own voracious pack, concluded in his\r\ndark and wicked mind, to release John Fetty, for a time at least, from\r\nthe severities he was enduring in the glorious cause of everlasting\r\ntruth! whose bright rewards are fixed beyond the boundaries of time,\r\nwithin the confines of eternity; where the arrow of the wicked cannot\r\nwound, even \"where there shall be no more sorrowing for the blessed,\r\nwho, in the mansion of eternal bliss shall glorify the Lamb forever and\r\never.\" He was accordingly by order of Bonner, (how disgraceful to all\r\ndignity, to say bishop!) liberated from the painful bonds, and led from\r\nLollard's Tower, to the chamber of that ungodly and infamous butcher,\r\nwhere, says Fox, he found the bishop bathing himself before a great\r\nfire; and at his first entering the chamber, Fetty said, \"God be here\r\nand peace!\" \"God be here and peace, (said Bonner,) that is neither God\r\nspeed nor good morrow!\" \"If ye kick against this peace, (said Fetty,)\r\nthen this is not the place that I seek for.\"\r\n\r\nA chaplain of the bishop, standing by, turned the poor man about and\r\nthinking to abash him, said, in mocking wise, \"What have we here--a\r\nplayer!\" While Fetty was thus standing in the bishop's chamber, he\r\nespied, hanging about the bishop's bed, a pair of great black beads,\r\nwhereupon he said, \"My Lord, I think the hangman is not far off; for the\r\nhalter (pointing to the beads) is here already!\" At which words the\r\nbishop was in a marvellous rage. Then he immediately after espied also,\r\nstanding in the bishop's chamber, in the window, a little crucifix. Then\r\nhe asked the bishop what it was, and he answered, that it was Christ.\r\n\"Was he handled as cruelly as he is here pictured?\" said Fetty. \"Yea,\r\nthat he was,\" said the bishop. \"And even so cruelly will you handle such\r\nas come before you; for you are unto God's people as Caiaphas was unto\r\nChrist!\" The bishop, being in a great fury, said, \"Thou art a vile\r\nheretic, and I will burn thee, or else I will spend all I have, unto my\r\ngown.\" \"Nay, my Lord, (said Fetty) you were better to give it to some\r\npoor body, that he may pray for you.\" Bonner, notwithstanding his\r\npassion, which was raised to the utmost by the calm and pointed remarks\r\nof this observing Christian, thought it most prudent to dismiss the\r\nfather, on account of the nearly murdered child. His coward soul\r\ntrembled for the consequences which might ensue; fear is inseparable\r\nfrom little minds; and this dastardly pampered priest experienced its\r\neffects so far as to induce him to assume the appearance of that he was\r\nan utter stranger to, namely, MERCY.\r\n\r\nThe father, on being dismissed, by the tyrant Bonner, went home with a\r\nheavy heart, with his dying child, who did not survive many days the\r\ncruelties which had been inflicted on him. How contrary to the will of\r\nour great King and Prophet, who mildly taught his followers, was the\r\nconduct of this sanguinary and false teacher, this vile apostate from\r\nhis God to Satan! But the arch-fiend had taken entire possession of his\r\nheart, and guided every action of the sinner he had hardened: who, given\r\nup to terrible destruction, was running the race of the wicked, marking\r\nhis footsteps with the blood of the saints, as if eager to arrive at the\r\ngoal of eternal death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Deliverance of Dr. Sands._\r\n\r\nThis eminent prelate, vice-chancellor of Cambridge, at the request of\r\nthe duke of Northumberland, when he came down to Cambridge in support of\r\nLady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, undertook at a few hours notice,\r\nto preach before the duke and the university. The text he took was such\r\nas presented itself in opening the Bible, and a more appropriate one he\r\ncould not have chosen, namely, the three last verses of Joshua. As God\r\ngave him the text, so he gave him also such order and utterance, that it\r\nexcited the most lively emotions in his numerous auditors. The sermon\r\nwas about to be sent to London to be printed, when news arrived that the\r\nduke had returned and queen Mary was proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe duke was immediately arrested, and Dr. Sands was compelled by the\r\nuniversity to give up his office. He was arrested by the queen's order,\r\nand when Mr. Mildmay wondered that so learned a man could wilfully incur\r\ndanger, and speak against so good a princess as Mary, the doctor\r\nreplied, \"If I would do as Mr. Mildmay has done, I need not fear bonds.\r\nHe came down armed against queen Mary; before a traitor--now a great\r\nfriend. I cannot with one mouth blow hot and cold in this manner.\" A\r\ngeneral plunder of Dr. Sands' property ensued, and he was brought to\r\nLondon upon a wretched horse. Various insults he met on the way from the\r\nbigoted catholics, and as he passed through Bishopsgate-street, a stone\r\nstruck him to the ground. He was the first prisoner that entered the\r\ntower, in that day, on a religious account; his man was admitted with\r\nhis Bible, but his shirts and other articles were taken from him.\r\n\r\nOn Mary's coronation-day, the doors of the dungeon were so laxly\r\nguarded, that it was easy to escape. A Mr. Mitchell, like a true friend,\r\ncame to him, afforded him his own clothes as a disguise, and was willing\r\nto abide the consequence of being found in his place. This was a rare\r\nfriendship: but he refused the offer; saying, \"I know no cause why I\r\nshould be in prison. To do thus, were to make myself guilty. I will\r\nexpect God's good will, yet do I think myself much obliged to you:\" and\r\nso Mr. Mitchell departed.\r\n\r\nWith doctor Sands was imprisoned Mr. Bradford; they were kept close in\r\nprison twenty-nine weeks. John Fowler, their keeper, was a perverse\r\npapist, yet, by often persuading him, at length he began to favour the\r\ngospel, and was so persuaded in the true religion, that on a Sunday,\r\nwhen they had mass in the chapel, Dr. Sands administered the communion\r\nto Bradford and to Fowler. Thus Fowler was their son begotten in bonds.\r\nTo make room for Wyat and his accomplices, Dr. Sands and nine other\r\npreachers were sent to the Marshalsea.\r\n\r\nThe keeper of the Marshalsea appointed to every preacher a man to lead\r\nhim in the street; he caused them to go on before, and he and Dr. Sands\r\nfollowed conversing together. By this time popery began to be unsavoury.\r\nAfter they had passed the bridge, the keeper said to Dr. Sands, \"I\r\nperceive the vain people would set you forward to the fire. You are as\r\nvain as they, if you, being a young man, will stand in your own conceit,\r\nand prefer your own judgment before that of so many worthy prelates,\r\nancient, learned, and grave men as be in this realm. If you do so, you\r\nshall find me a severe keeper, and one that utterly dislikes your\r\nreligion.\" Dr. Sands answered, \"I know my years to be young, and my\r\nlearning but small; it is enough to know Christ crucified, and he hath\r\nlearned nothing who seeth not the great blasphemy that is in popery. I\r\nwill yield unto God, and not unto man; I have read in the Scriptures of\r\nmany godly and courteous keepers: may God make you one! if not, I trust\r\nhe will give me strength and patience to bear your hard usage.\" Then\r\nsaid the keeper, \"Are you resolved to stand to your religion?\" \"Yes,\"\r\nquoth the doctor, \"by God's grace!\" \"Truly,\" said the keeper, \"I love\r\nyou the better for it; I did but tempt you: what favour I can show you,\r\nyou shall be assured of; and I shall think myself happy if I might die\r\nat the stake with you.\" He was as good as his word, for he trusted the\r\ndoctor to walk in the fields alone, where he met with Mr. Bradford, who\r\nwas also a prisoner in the King's Bench, and had found the same favour\r\nfrom his keeper. At his request, he put Mr. Saunders in along with him,\r\nto be his bed-fellow, and the communion was administered to a great\r\nnumber of communicants.\r\n\r\nWhen Wyat with his army came to Southwark, he offered to liberate all\r\nthe imprisoned protestants, but Dr. Sands and the rest of the preachers\r\nrefused to accept freedom on such terms.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Sands had been nine weeks prisoner in the Marshalsea, by the\r\nmediation of Sir Thomas Holcroft, knight marshal, he was set at liberty.\r\nThough Mr. Holcroft had the queen's warrant, the bishop commanded him\r\nnot to set Dr. Sands at liberty, until he had taken sureties of two\r\ngentlemen with him, each one bound in L500, that Dr. Sands should not\r\ndepart out of the realm without license. Mr. Holcroft immediately after\r\nmet with two gentlemen of the north, friends and cousins to Dr. Sands,\r\nwho offered to be bound for him.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the same day, Sir Thomas Holcroft sent for Dr. Sands to\r\nhis lodging at Westminster, to communicate to him all he had done. Dr.\r\nSands answered, \"I give God thanks, who hath moved your heart to mind me\r\nso well, that I think myself most bound unto you. God shall requite you,\r\nnor shall I ever be found unthankful. But as you have dealt friendly\r\nwith me, I will also deal plainly with you. I came a freeman into\r\nprison; I will not go forth a bondman. As I cannot benefit my friends,\r\nso will I not hurt them. And if I be set at liberty, I will not tarry\r\nsix days in this realm, if I may get out. If therefore I may not get\r\nfree forth, send me to the Marshalsea again, and there you shall be sure\r\nof me.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer Mr. Holcroft much disapproved of; but like a true friend he\r\nreplied, \"Seeing you cannot be altered, I will change my purpose, and\r\nyield unto you. Come of it what will, I will set you at liberty; and\r\nseeing you have a mind to go over sea, get you gone as quick as you can.\r\nOne thing I require of you, that, while you are there, you write nothing\r\nto me hither, for this may undo me.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Sands having taken an affectionate farewell of him, and his other\r\nfriends in bonds, departed. He went by Winchester house, and there took\r\nboat, and came to a friend's house in London, called William Banks, and\r\ntarried there one night. The next night he went to another friend's\r\nhouse, and there he heard that strict search was making for him, by\r\nGardiner's express order.\r\n\r\nDr. Sands now conveyed himself by night to one Mr. Berty's house, a\r\nstranger who was in the Marshalsea prison with him a while; he was a\r\ngood protestant and dwelt in Mark-lake. There he was six days, and then\r\nremoved to one of his acquaintances in Cornhill; he caused his man\r\nQuinton to provide two geldings for him, resolved on the morrow to ride\r\ninto Essex, to Mr. Sands, his father-in-law, where his wife was, which\r\nafter a narrow escape, he effected. He had not been there two hours,\r\nbefore Mr. Sands was told that two of the guards would that night\r\napprehend Dr. Sands.\r\n\r\nThat night Dr. Sands was guided to an honest farmer's near the sea,\r\nwhere he tarried two days and two nights in a chamber without company.\r\nAfter that he removed to one James Mower's, a ship-master, who dwelt at\r\nMilton-Shore, where he waited for a wind to Flanders. While he was\r\nthere, James Mower brought to him forty or fifty mariners, to whom he\r\ngave an exhortation; they liked him so well, that they promised to die\r\nrather than he should be apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe sixth of May, Sunday, the wind served. In taking leave of his\r\nhostess, who had been married eight years without having a child, he\r\ngave her a fine handkerchief and an old royal of gold, and said, \"Be of\r\ngood comfort; before that one whole year be past, God shall give you a\r\nchild, a boy.\" This came to pass, for, that day twelvemonth, wanting one\r\nday, God gave her a son.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he arrived at Antwerp, when he learned that king Philip had\r\nsent to apprehend him. He next flew to Augsburgh, in Cleveland, where\r\nDr. Sands tarried fourteen days, and then travelled towards Strasburgh,\r\nwhere, after he had lived one year, his wife came to him. He was sick of\r\na flux nine months, and had a child which died of the plague. His\r\namiable wife at length fell into a consumption, and died in his arms.\r\nWhen his wife was dead, he went to Zurich, and there was in Peter\r\nMartyr's house for the space of five weeks. As they sat at dinner one\r\nday, word was suddenly brought that queen Mary was dead, and Dr. Sands\r\nwas sent for by his friends at Strasburgh, where he preached. Mr.\r\nGrindall and he came over to England, and arrived in London the same day\r\nthat queen Elizabeth was crowned. This faithful servant of Christ, under\r\nqueen Elizabeth, rose to the highest distinctions in the church, being\r\nsuccessively bishop of Worcester, bishop of London, and archbishop of\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Mary's treatment of her sister the Princess Elizabeth._\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the princess Elizabeth may be reckoned a remarkable\r\ninstance of the watchful eye which Christ had over his church. The\r\nbigotry of Mary regarded not the ties of consanguinity, of natural\r\naffection, of national succession. Her mind, physically morose was under\r\nthe dominion of men who possessed not the milk of human kindness, and\r\nwhose principles were sanctioned and enjoined by the idolatrous tenets\r\nof the Romish pontiff. Could they have foreseen the short date of Mary's\r\nreign, they would have imbrued their hands in the protestant blood of\r\nElizabeth, and, as a _sine qua non_ of the queen's salvation, have\r\ncompelled her to bequeath the kingdom to some catholic prince. The\r\ncontest might have been attended with the horrors incidental to a\r\nreligious civil war, and calamities might have been felt in England\r\nsimilar to those under Henry the Great in France, whom queen Elizabeth\r\nassisted in opposing his priest-ridden catholic subjects. As if\r\nProvidence had the perpetual establishment of the protestant faith in\r\nview, the difference of the durations of the two reigns is worthy of\r\nnotice. Mary might have reigned many years in the course of nature, but\r\nthe course of grace willed it otherwise. Five years and four months was\r\nthe time of persecution alloted to this weak, disgraceful reign, while\r\nthat of Elizabeth reckoned a number of years among the highest of those\r\nwho have sat on the English throne, almost nine times that of her\r\nmerciless sister!\r\n\r\nBefore Mary attained the crown, she treated her with a sisterly\r\nkindness, but from that period her conduct was altered, and the most\r\nimperious distance substituted. Though Elizabeth had no concern in the\r\nrebellion of Sir Thomas Wyat, yet she was apprehended, and treated as a\r\nculprit in that commotion. The manner too of her arrest was similar to\r\nthe mind that dictated it: the three cabinet members, whom she deputed\r\nto see the arrest executed, rudely entered the chamber at ten o'clock at\r\nnight, and, though she was extremely ill, they could scarcely be induced\r\nto let her remain till the following morning. Her enfeebled state\r\npermitted her to be moved only by short stages in a journey of such\r\nlength to London; but the princess, though afflicted in person, had a\r\nconsolation in mind which her sister never could purchase: the people,\r\nthrough whom she passed on her way, pitied her, and put up their prayers\r\nfor her preservation. Arrived at court, she was made a close prisoner\r\nfor a fortnight, without knowing who was her accuser, or seeing any one\r\nwho could console or advise her. The charge however was at length\r\nunmasked by Gardiner, who, with nineteen of the council, accused her of\r\nabetting Wyat's conspiracy, which she religiously affirmed to be false.\r\nFailing in this, they placed against her the transactions of Sir Peter\r\nCarew in the west in which they were as unsuccessful as in the former.\r\nThe queen now signified, it was her pleasure she should be committed to\r\nthe Tower, a step which overwhelmed the princess with the greatest alarm\r\nand uneasiness. In vain she hoped the queen's majesty would not commit\r\nher to such a place; but there was no lenity to be expected; her\r\nattendants were limited, and a hundred northern soldiers appointed to\r\nguard her day and night.\r\n\r\nOn Palm-Sunday she was conducted to the Tower. When she came to the\r\npalace garden, she cast her eyes towards the windows, eagerly anxious to\r\nmeet those of the queen, but she was disappointed. A strict order was\r\ngiven in London, that every one should go to church, and carry palms,\r\nthat she might be conveyed without clamour or commiseration to her\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nAt the time of passing under London-bridge the fall of the tide made it\r\nvery dangerous, and the barge some time stuck fast against the\r\nstarlings. To mortify her the more, she was landed at Traitors' Stairs.\r\nAs it rained fast, and she was obliged to step in the water to land, she\r\nhesitated; but this excited no complaisance in the lord in waiting. When\r\nshe set her foot on the steps, she exclaimed, \"Here lands as true a\r\nsubject, being prisoner, as ever landed at these stairs; and before\r\nthee, O God, I speak it, having no friend but thee alone!\"\r\n\r\nA large number of the wardens and servants of the Tower were arranged\r\nin order, between whom the princess had to pass. Upon inquiring the use\r\nof this parade, she was informed it was customary to do so. \"If,\" said\r\nshe, \"it is on account of me, I beseech you that they may be dismissed.\"\r\nOn this the poor men knelt down, and prayed that God would preserve her\r\ngrace, for which they were the next day turned out of their employments.\r\nThe tragic scene must have been deeply interesting, to see an amiable\r\nand irreproachable princess sent like a lamb to languish in expectation\r\nof cruelty and death; against whom there was no other charge than her\r\nsuperiority in Christian virtues and acquired endowments. Her attendants\r\nopenly wept as she proceeded with a dignified step to the frowning\r\nbattlements of her destination. \"Alas!\" said Elizabeth, \"what do you\r\nmean? I took you to comfort, not to dismay me; for my truth is such,\r\nthat no one shall have cause to weep for me.\"\r\n\r\nThe next step of her enemies was to procure evidence by means which, in\r\nthe present day, are accounted detestable. Many poor prisoners were\r\nracked, to extract, if possible, any matters of accusation which might\r\naffect her life, and thereby gratify Gardiner's sanguinary disposition.\r\nHe himself came to examine her, respecting her removal from her house at\r\nAshbridge to Dunnington castle a long while before. The princess had\r\nquite forgotten this trivial circumstance, and lord Arundel, after the\r\ninvestigation, kneeling down, apologized for having troubled her in such\r\na frivolous matter. \"You sift me narrowly,\" replied the princess, \"but\r\nof this I am assured, that God has appointed a limit to your\r\nproceedings; and so God forgive you all.\"\r\n\r\nHer own gentlemen, who ought to have been her purveyors, and served her\r\nprovision, were compelled to give place to the common soldiers, at the\r\ncommand of the constable of the Tower, who was in every respect a\r\nservile tool of Gardiner,--her grace's friends, however, procured an\r\norder of council which regulated this petty tyranny more to her\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAfter having been a whole month in close confinement, she sent for the\r\nlord Chamberlain and lord Chandois, to whom she represented the ill\r\nstate of her health from a want of proper air and exercise. Application\r\nbeing made to the council, Elizabeth was with some difficulty admitted\r\nto walk in the queen's lodgings, and afterwards in the garden, at which\r\ntime the prisoners on that side were attended by their keepers, and not\r\nsuffered to look down upon her. Their jealousy was excited by a child of\r\nfour years old, who daily brought flowers to the princess. The child was\r\nthreatened with a whipping, and the father ordered to keep him from the\r\nprincess' chambers.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of May the constable was discharged from his office, and Sir\r\nHenry Benifield appointed in his room, accompanied by a hundred\r\nruffian-looking soldiers in blue. This measure created considerable\r\nalarm in the mind of the princess, who imagined it was preparatory to\r\nher undergoing the same fate as lady Jane Gray, upon the same block.\r\nAssured that this project was not in agitation, she entertained an idea\r\nthat the new keeper of the Tower was commissioned to make away with her\r\nprivately, as his equivocal character was in conformity with the\r\nferocious inclination of those by whom he was appointed.\r\n\r\nA report now obtained that her grace was to be taken away by the new\r\nconstable and his soldiers, which in the sequel proved to be true. An\r\norder of council was made for her removal to the manor of Woodstock,\r\nwhich took place on Trinity Sunday, May 13, under the authority of Sir\r\nHenry Benifield and Lord Tame. The ostensible cause of her removal was\r\nto make room for other prisoners. Richmond was the first place they\r\nstopped at, and here the princess slept, not however without much alarm\r\nat first, as her own servants were superseded by the soldiers, who were\r\nplaced as guards at her chamber door. Upon representation, Lord Tame\r\noverruled this indecent stretch of power, and granted her perfect safety\r\nwhile under his custody.\r\n\r\nIn passing through Windsor, she saw several of her poor dejected\r\nservants waiting to see her. \"Go to them,\" said she, to one of her\r\nattendants, \"and say these words from me, tanquim ovis, that is, like a\r\nsheep to the slaughter.\"\r\n\r\nThe next night her grace lodged at the house of a Mr. Dormer, in her way\r\nto which the people manifested such tokens of loyal affection, that Sir\r\nHenry was indignant, and bestowed on them very liberally the names of\r\nrebels and traitors. In some villages they rang the bells for joy,\r\nimagining the princess's arrival among them was from a very different\r\ncause; but this harmless demonstration of gladness was sufficient with\r\nthe persecuting Benefield to order his soldiers to seize and set these\r\nhumble persons in the stocks.\r\n\r\nThe day following, her grace arrived at Lord Tame's house, where she\r\nstaid all night, and was most nobly entertained. This excited Sir\r\nHenry's indignation, and made him caution Lord Tame to look well to his\r\nproceedings; but the humanity of Lord Tame was not to be frightened, and\r\nhe returned a suitable reply. At another time, this official prodigal,\r\nto show his consequence and disregard of good manners, went up into a\r\nchamber, where was appointed for her grace a chair, two cushions, and a\r\nfoot carpet, wherein he presumptuously sat and called his man to pull\r\noff his boots. As soon as it was known to the ladies and gentlemen, they\r\nlaughed him to scorn. When supper was done, he called to his lordship,\r\nand directed that all gentlemen and ladies should withdraw home,\r\nmarvelling much that he would permit such a large company, considering\r\nthe great charge he had committed to him. \"Sir Henry,\" said his\r\nlordship, \"content yourself; all shall be avoided, your men and all.\"\r\n\"Nay, but my soldiers,\" replied Sir Henry, \"shall watch all night.\" Lord\r\nTame answered, \"There is no need.\" \"Well,\" said he, \"need or need not,\r\nthey shall so do.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day her grace took her journey from thence to Woodstock, where\r\nshe was enclosed, as before in the Tower of London, the soldiers\r\nkeeping guard within and without the walls, every day, to the number of\r\nsixty; and in the night, without the walls were forty during all the\r\ntime of her imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAt length she was permitted to walk in the gardens, but under the most\r\nsevere restrictions, Sir Henry keeping the keys himself, and placing her\r\nalways under many bolts and locks, whence she was induced to call him\r\nher jailer, at which he felt offended, and begged her to substitute the\r\nword officer. After much earnest entreaty to the council, she obtained\r\npermission to write to the queen; but the jailer, who brought her pen,\r\nink, and paper stood by her while she wrote, and, when she left off, he\r\ncarried the things away till they were wanted again. He also insisted\r\nupon carrying it himself to the queen, but Elizabeth would not suffer\r\nhim to be the bearer, and it was presented by one of her gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAfter the letter, doctors Owen and Wendy went to the princess, as the\r\nstate of her health rendered medical assistance necessary. They staid\r\nwith her five or six days, in which time she grew much better; they then\r\nreturned to the queen, and spoke flatteringly of the princess'\r\nsubmission and humility, at which the queen seemed moved; but the\r\nbishops wanted a concession that she had offended her majesty. Elizabeth\r\nspurned this indirect mode of acknowledging herself guilty. \"If I have\r\noffended,\" said she, \"and am guilty, I crave no mercy but the law, which\r\nI am certain I should have had ere this, if any thing could have been\r\nproved against me. I wish I were as clear from the peril of my enemies;\r\nthen should I not be thus bolted and locked up within walls and doors.\"\r\n\r\nMuch question arose at this time respecting the propriety of uniting the\r\nprincess to some foreigner, that she might quit the realm with a\r\nsuitable portion. One of the council had the brutality to urge the\r\nnecessity of beheading her, if the king (Philip) meant to keep the realm\r\nin peace; but the Spaniards, detesting such a base thought, replied,\r\n\"God forbid that our king and master should consent to such an infamous\r\nproceeding!\" Stimulated by a noble principle, the Spaniards from this\r\ntime repeatedly urged to the king that it would do him the highest\r\nhonour to liberate the lady Elizabeth, nor was the king impervious to\r\ntheir solicitation. He took her out of prison, and shortly after she was\r\nsent for to Hampton court. It may be remarked in this place, that the\r\nfallacy of human reasoning is shown in every moment. The barbarian who\r\nsuggested the policy of beheading Elizabeth little contemplated the\r\nchange of condition which his speech would bring about. In her journey\r\nfrom Woodstock, Benefield treated her with the same severity as before;\r\nremoving her on a stormy day, and not suffering her old servant, who had\r\ncome to Colnbrook, where she slept, to speak to her.\r\n\r\nShe remained a fortnight strictly guarded and watched, before any one\r\ndared to speak with her; at length the vile Gardiner with three more of\r\nthe council, came with great submission. Elizabeth saluted them,\r\nremarked that she had been for a long time kept in solitary\r\nconfinement, and begged they would intercede with the king and queen to\r\ndeliver her from prison. Gardiner's visit was to draw from the princess\r\na confession of her guilt; but she was guarded against his subtlety,\r\nadding, that, rather than admit she had done wrong, she would lie in\r\nprison all the rest of her life. The next day Gardiner came again, and\r\nkneeling down, declared that the queen was astonished she should persist\r\nin affirming that she was blameless--whence it would be inferred that\r\nthe queen had unjustly imprisoned her grace. Gardiner farther informed\r\nher that the queen had declared that she must tell another tale, before\r\nshe could be set at liberty. \"Then,\" replied the high-minded Elizabeth,\r\n\"I had rather be in prison with honesty and truth, than have my liberty,\r\nand be suspected by her majesty. What I have said, I will stand to; nor\r\nwill I ever speak falsehood!\" The bishop and his friends then departed,\r\nleaving her locked up as before.\r\n\r\nSeven days after the queen sent for Elizabeth at ten o'clock at night,\r\ntwo years had elapsed since they had seen each other. It created terror\r\nin the mind of the princess, who, at setting out, desired her gentlemen\r\nand ladies to pray for her, as her return to them again was uncertain.\r\n\r\nBeing conducted to the queen's bedchamber, upon entering it the princess\r\nknelt down, and having begged of God to preserve her majesty, she humbly\r\nassured her that her majesty had not a more loyal subject in the realm,\r\nwhatever reports might be circulated to the contrary. With a haughty\r\nungraciousness, the imperious queen replied, \"You will not confess your\r\noffence, but stand stoutly to your truth. I pray God it may so fall\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it do not,\" said Elizabeth, \"I request neither favour nor pardon at\r\nyour majesty's hands.\" \"Well,\" said the queen, \"you stiffly still\r\npersevere in your truth. Besides, you will not confess that you have not\r\nbeen wrongfully punished.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must not say so, if it please your majesty, to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" said the queen, \"belike you will to others.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, if it please your majesty: I have borne the burden, and must bear\r\nit. I humbly beseech your majesty to have a good opinion of me and to\r\nthink me to be your subject, not only from the beginning hitherto, but\r\nfor ever, as long as life lasteth.\" They departed without any heart-felt\r\nsatisfaction on either side; nor can we think the conduct of Elizabeth\r\ndisplayed that independence and fortitude which accompanies perfect\r\ninnocence. Elizabeth's admitting that she would not say neither to the\r\nqueen nor to others, that she had been unjustly punished, was in direct\r\ncontradiction to what she had told Gardiner, and must have arisen from\r\nsome motive at this time inexplicable.--King Philip is supposed to have\r\nbeen secretly concealed during the interview, and to have been friendly\r\nto the princess.\r\n\r\nIn seven days from the time of her return to imprisonment, her severe\r\njailer, and his men were discharged, and she was set at liberty, under\r\nthe constraint of being always attended and watched by some of the\r\nqueen's council. Four of her gentlemen were sent to the Tower without\r\nany other charge against them than being zealous servants of their\r\nmistress. This event was soon after followed by the happy news of\r\nGardiner's death, for which all good and merciful men glorified God,\r\ninasmuch as it had taken the chief tiger from the den, and rendered the\r\nlife of the protestant successor of Mary more secure.\r\n\r\nThis miscreant, while the princess was in the Tower, sent a secret writ,\r\nsigned by a few of the council, for her private execution, and, had Mr.\r\nBridges, lieutenant of the Tower, been as little scrupulous of dark\r\nassassination as this pious prelate was, she must have perished. The\r\nwarrant not having the queen's signature, Mr. Bridges hastened to her\r\nmajesty, to give her information of it, and to know her mind. This was a\r\nplot of Winchester's, who, to convict her of treasonable practices,\r\ncaused several prisoners to be racked; particularly Mr. Edmund Tremaine\r\nand Smithwicke were offered considerable bribes to accuse the guiltless\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\nHer life was several times in danger. While at Woodstock, fire was\r\napparently put between the boards and ceiling under which she lay. It\r\nwas also reported strongly, that one Paul Penny, the keeper of\r\nWoodstock, a notorious ruffian was appointed to assassinate her, but,\r\nhowever this might be, God counteracted in this point the nefarious\r\ndesigns of the enemies of the reformation. James Basset was another\r\nappointed to perform the same deed: he was a peculiar favourite of\r\nGardiner, and had come within a mile of Woodstock, intending to speak\r\nwith Benefield on the subject. The goodness of God however so ordered\r\nit, that while Basset was travelling to Woodstock, Benefield, by an\r\norder of council, was going to London; in consequence of which, he left\r\na positive order with his brother, that no man should be admitted to the\r\nprincess during his absence, not even with a note from the queen; his\r\nbrother met the murderer, but the latter's intention was frustrated, as\r\nno admission could be obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth quitted Woodstock, she left the following lines written\r\nwith her diamond on the window:--\r\n\r\n        Much suspected by me,\r\n        Nothing proved can be. Quoth Elizabeth, prisoner.\r\n\r\nWith the life of Winchester ceased the extreme danger of the princess,\r\nas many of her other secret enemies soon after followed him, and, last\r\nof all, her cruel sister, who outlived Gardiner but three years. The\r\ndeath of Mary was ascribed to several causes. The council endeavoured to\r\nconsole her in her last moments, imagining it was the absence of her\r\nhusband that lay heavy at her heart, but though his treatment had some\r\nweight, the loss of Calais, the last fortress possessed by the English\r\nin France, was the true source of her sorrow. \"Open my heart,\" said\r\nMary, \"when I am dead, and you shall find Calais written there.\"\r\nReligion caused her no alarm; the priests had lulled to rest every\r\nmisgiving of conscience, which might have obtruded, on account of the\r\naccusing spirits of the murdered martyrs. Not the blood she had spilled,\r\nbut the loss of a town, excited her emotions in dying, and this last\r\nstroke seemed to be awarded, that her fanatical persecution might be\r\nparalleled by her political imbecility. We earnestly pray that the\r\nannals of no country, catholic or pagan, may ever be stained with such a\r\nrepetition of human sacrifices to papal power, and that the detestation\r\nin which the character of Mary is holden, may be a beacon to succeeding\r\nmonarchs to avoid the rocks of fanaticism!\r\n\r\n\r\n_God's Punishments upon some of the Persecutors of his People in Mary's\r\nReign._\r\n\r\nAfter that arch-persecutor, Gardiner, was dead, others followed, of whom\r\nDr. Morgan, bishop of St. David's, who succeeded bishop Farrar, is to be\r\nnoticed. Not long after he was installed in his bishopric, he was\r\nstricken by the visitation of God; his food passed through the throat,\r\nbut rose again with great violence. In this manner, almost literally\r\nstarved to death, he terminated his existence.\r\n\r\nBishop Thornton, suffragan of Dover, was an indefatigable persecutor of\r\nthe true church. One day after he had exercised his cruel tyranny upon a\r\nnumber of pious persons at Canterbury, he came from the chapter-house to\r\nBorne, where as he stood on a Sunday looking at his men playing at\r\nbowls, he fell down in a fit of the palsy, and did not long survive.\r\n\r\nAfter the latter succeeded another bishop or suffragan, ordained by\r\nGardiner, who not long after he had been raised to the see of Dover,\r\nfell down a pair of stairs in the cardinal's chamber at Greenwich, and\r\nbroke his neck. He had just received the cardinal's blessing--he could\r\nreceive nothing worse.\r\n\r\nJohn Cooper, of Watsam, Suffolk, suffered by perjury; he was from\r\nprivate pique persecuted by one Fenning, who suborned two others to\r\nswear that they heard Cooper say, \"If God did not take away queen Mary,\r\nthe devil would.\" Cooper denied all such words, but Cooper was a\r\nprotestant and a heretic, and therefore he was hung, drawn and\r\nquartered, his property confiscated, and his wife and nine children\r\nreduced to beggary. The following harvest, however, Grimwood of Hitcham,\r\none of the witnesses before mentioned, was visited for his villany:\r\nwhile at work, stacking up corn, his bowels suddenly burst out, and\r\nbefore relief could be obtained he died. Thus was deliberate perjury\r\nrewarded by sudden death!\r\n\r\nIn the case of the martyr Mr. Bradford, the severity of Mr. Sheriff\r\nWoodroffe has been noticed--he rejoiced at the death of the saints, and\r\nat Mr. Rogers' execution, he broke the carman's head, because he stopped\r\nthe cart to let the martyr's children take a last farewell of him.\r\nScarcely had Mr. Woodroffe's sheriffalty expired a week, when he was\r\nstruck with a paralytic affection, and languished a few days in the most\r\npitiable and helpless condition, presenting a striking contrast to his\r\nformer activity in the cause of blood.\r\n\r\nRalph Lardyn, who betrayed the martyr George Eagles, is believed to have\r\nbeen afterward arraigned and hanged in consequence of accusing himself.\r\nAt the bar, he denounced himself in these words, \"This has most justly\r\nfallen upon me, for betraying the innocent blood of that just and good\r\nman George Eagles, who was here condemned in the time of Queen Mary by\r\nmy procurement, when I sold his blood for a little money.\"\r\n\r\nAs James Abbes was going to execution, and exhorting the pitying\r\nbystanders to adhere steadfastly to the truth, and like him to seal the\r\ncause of Christ with their blood, a servant of the sheriff's interrupted\r\nhim, and blasphemously called his religion heresy, and the good man a\r\nlunatic. Scarcely however had the flames reached the martyr, before the\r\nfearful stroke of God fell upon this hardened wretch, in the presence of\r\nhim he had so cruelly ridiculed. The man was suddenly seized with\r\nlunacy, cast off his clothes and shoes before the people, (as Abbes had\r\ndone just before, to distribute among some poor persons,) at the same\r\ntime exclaiming, \"Thus did James Abbes, the true servant of God, who is\r\nsaved but I am damned.\" Repeating this often, the sheriff had him\r\nsecured, and made him put his clothes on, but no sooner was he alone,\r\nthan he tore them off, and exclaimed as before. Being tied in a cart, he\r\nwas conveyed to his master's house, and in about half a year he died;\r\njust before which a priest came to attend him, with the crucifix, &c.\r\nbut the wretched man bade him take away such trumpery, and said that he\r\nand other priests had been the cause of his damnation, but that Abbes\r\nwas saved.\r\n\r\nOne Clark, an avowed enemy of the protestants in king Edward's reign,\r\nhung himself in the Tower of London.\r\n\r\nFroling, a priest of much celebrity, fell down in the street and died on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nDale, an indefatigable informer, was consumed by vermin, and died a\r\nmiserable spectacle.\r\n\r\nAlexander, the severe keeper of Newgate, died miserably, swelling to a\r\nprodigious size, and became so inwardly putrid, that none could come\r\nnear him. This cruel minister of the law would go to Bonner, Story, and\r\nothers, requesting them to rid his prison, he was so much pestered with\r\nheretics! The son of this keeper, in three years after his father's\r\ndeath, dissipated his great property, and died suddenly in Newgate\r\nmarket. \"The sins of the father,\" says the decalogue, \"shall be visited\r\non the children.\" John Peter, son-in-law of Alexander, a horrid\r\nblasphemer and persecutor, died wretchedly. When he affirmed any thing,\r\nhe would say, \"If it be not true, I pray I may rot ere I die.\" This\r\nawful state visited him in all its loathsomeness.\r\n\r\nSir Ralph Ellerker was eagerly desirous to see the heart taken out of\r\nAdam Damlip, who was wrongfully put to death. Shortly after Sir Ralph\r\nwas slain by the French, who mangled him dreadfully, cut off his limbs,\r\nand tore his heart out.\r\n\r\nWhen Gardiner heard of the miserable end of Judge Hales, he called the\r\nprofession of the gospel a doctrine of desperation; but he forgot that\r\nthe judge's despondency arose after he had consented to the papistry.\r\nBut with more reason may this be said of the catholic tenets, if we\r\nconsider the miserable end of Dr. Pendleton, Gardiner, and most of the\r\nleading persecutors. Gardiner, upon his death bed, was reminded by a\r\nbishop of Peter denying his master. \"Ah,\" said Gardiner, \"I have denied\r\nwith Peter, but never repented with Peter.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the accession of Elizabeth, most of the Catholic prelates were\r\nimprisoned in the Tower or the fleet; Bonner was put into the\r\nMarshalsea.\r\n\r\nOf the revilers of God's word, we detail, among many others, the\r\nfollowing occurrence. One William Maldon, living at Greenwich in\r\nservitude, was instructing himself profitably in reading an English\r\nprimer one winter's evening. A serving man, named John Powell, sat by,\r\nand ridiculed all that Maldon said, who cautioned him not to make a jest\r\nof the word of God. Powell nevertheless continued, till Maldon came to\r\ncertain English Prayers, and read aloud, Lord, have mercy upon us,\r\nChrist have mercy upon us, &c. Suddenly the reviler started, and\r\nexclaimed, Lord, have mercy upon us! He was struck with the utmost\r\nterror of mind, said the evil spirit could not abide that Christ should\r\nhave any mercy upon him, and sunk into madness. He was remitted to\r\nBedlam, and became an awful warning that God will not always be insulted\r\nwith impunity.\r\n\r\nHenry Smith, a student in the law, had a pious protestant father, of\r\nCamden, in Gloucestershire, by whom he was virtuously educated. While\r\nstudying law in the middle temple, he was induced to profess\r\ncatholicism, and, going to Louvain, in France, he returned with pardons,\r\ncrucifixes, and a great freight of popish toys. Not content with these\r\nthings, he openly reviled the gospel religion he had been brought up in;\r\nbut conscience one night reproached him so dreadfully, that in a fit of\r\ndespair he hung himself in his garters. He was buried in a lane, without\r\nthe Christian service being read over him.\r\n\r\nDr. Story, whose name has been so often mentioned in the preceding\r\npages, was reserved to be cut off by public execution, a practice in\r\nwhich he had taken great delight when in power. He is supposed to have\r\nhad a hand in most of the conflagrations in Mary's time, and was even\r\ningenious in his invention of new modes of inflicting torture. When\r\nElizabeth came to the throne, he was committed to prison, but\r\nunaccountably effected his escape to the continent, to carry fire and\r\nsword there among the protestant brethren. From the duke of Alva, at\r\nAntwerp, he received a special commission to search all ships for\r\ncontraband goods, and particularly for English heretical books.\r\n\r\nDr. Story gloried in a commission that was ordered by Providence to be\r\nhis ruin, and to preserve the faithful from his sanguinary cruelty. It\r\nwas contrived that one Parker, a merchant, should sail to Antwerp and\r\ninformation should be given to Dr. Story that he had a quantity of\r\nheretical books on board. The latter no sooner heard this, than he\r\nhastened to the vessel, sought every where above, and then went under\r\nthe hatches, which were fastened down upon him. A prosperous gale\r\nbrought the ship to England, and this traitorous, persecuting rebel was\r\ncommitted to prison, where he remained a considerable time, obstinately\r\nobjecting to recant his anti-christian spirit, or admit of queen\r\nElizabeth's supremacy. He alleged, though by birth and education an\r\nEnglishman, that he was a sworn subject of the king of Spain, in whose\r\nservice the famous duke of Alva was. The doctor being condemned, was\r\nlaid upon a hurdle, and drawn from the Tower to Tyburn, where after\r\nbeing suspended about half an hour, he was cut down, stripped, and the\r\nexecutioner displayed the heart of a traitor. Thus ended the existence\r\nof this Nimrod of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH ARMADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip, king of Spain, husband to the deceased queen Mary of England,\r\nwas no less an enemy than that princess to the protestants. He had\r\nalways disliked the English, and after her death, determined, if\r\npossible, to crown that infamous cruelty which had disgraced the whole\r\nprogress of her reign, by making a conquest of the island, and putting\r\nevery protestant to death.\r\n\r\nThe great warlike preparations made by this monarch, though the purpose\r\nwas unknown, gave a universal alarm to the English nation; as, though he\r\nhad not declared that intention, yet it appeared evident that he was\r\ntaking measures to seize the crown of England. Pope Sixtus V. not less\r\nambitious than himself, and equally desirous of persecuting the\r\nprotestants, urged him to the enterprise. He excommunicated the queen,\r\nand published a crusade against her, with the usual indulgences. All the\r\nports of Spain resounded with preparations for this alarming expedition;\r\nand the Spaniards seemed to threaten the English with a total\r\nannihilation.\r\n\r\nThree whole years had been spent by Philip in making the necessary\r\npreparations for this mighty undertaking; and his fleet, which on\r\naccount of its prodigious strength, was called the \"Invincible Armada,\"\r\nwas now completed. A consecrated banner was procured from the pope, and\r\nthe gold of Peru was lavished on the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Parma, by command of the Spaniards, built ships in Flanders,\r\nand a great company of small broad vessels, each one able to transport\r\nthirty horses, with bridges fitted for them severally; and hired\r\nmariners from the east part of Germany, and provided long pieces of wood\r\nsharpened at the end, and covered with iron, with hooks on one side; and\r\n20,000 vessels, with a huge number of fagots; and placed an army ready\r\nin Flanders, of 103 companies of foot and 4000 horsemen. Among these 700\r\nEnglish vagabonds, who were held of all others in most contempt. Neither\r\nwas Stanley respected or obeyed who was set over the English; nor\r\nWestmoreland, nor any other who offered their help, but for their\r\nunfaithfulness to their own country were shut out from all\r\nconsultations, and as men unanimously rejected with detestation. And\r\nbecause Pope Sixtus the Fifth in such a case would not be wanting, he\r\nsent Cardinal Allen into Flanders, and renewed the bulls declaratory of\r\nPope Pius the Fifth, and Gregory the Thirteenth.\r\n\r\nHe excommunicated and deposed queen Elizabeth, absolved her subjects\r\nfrom all allegiance, and, as if it had been against the Turks or\r\ninfidels, he set forth in print a conceit, wherein he bestowed plenary\r\nindulgences, out of the treasure of the church, besides a million of\r\ngold, or ten hundred thousand ducats, to be distributed (the one half in\r\nhand, the rest when either England, or some famous haven therein, should\r\nbe won) upon all them that would join their help against England. By\r\nwhich means the Marquis of Bergau, of the house of Austria, the duke of\r\nPastrana, Amadis, duke of Savoy, Vespasian, Gonzaga, John Medicis, and\r\ndivers other noblemen, were drawn into these wars.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth, that she might not be surprised unawares, prepared as\r\ngreat a navy as she could, and with singular care and providence, made\r\nall things ready necessary for war. And she herself, who was ever most\r\njudicious in discerning of men's wits and aptness, and most happy in\r\nmaking choice, when she made it out of her own judgment, and not at the\r\ndiscretion of others, designed the best and most serviceable to each\r\nseveral employment. Over the whole navy she appointed the Lord Admiral\r\nCharles Howard, in whom she reposed much trust; and sent him to the west\r\npart of England, where Captain Drake, whom she made vice-admiral, joined\r\nwith him. She commanded Henry Seimor, the second son to the duke of\r\nSomerset, to watch upon the Belgic shore, with forty English and Dutch\r\nships, that the duke of Parma might not come out with his forces;\r\nalthough some were of opinion, that the enemy was to be expected and set\r\nupon by land forces, accordingly as it was upon deliberation resolved,\r\nin the time of Henry the Eighth, when the French brought a great navy on\r\nthe English shore.\r\n\r\nFor the land fight, there were placed on the south shore twenty\r\nthousand; and two armies beside were mustered of the choicest men for\r\nwar. The one of these, which consisted of 1000 horse and twenty two\r\nthousand foot was commanded by the earl of Leicester, and encamped at\r\nTilbury, on the side of the Thames. For the enemy was resolved first to\r\nset upon London. The other army was commanded by the Lord Hunsdon,\r\nconsisting of thirty-four thousand foot, and two thousand horse, to\r\nguard the queen.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Gray, Sir Francis Knowles, Sir John Norris, Sir Richard\r\nBingham, Sir Roger Williams, men famously known for military experience,\r\nwere chosen to confer of the land-fight. These commanders thought fit\r\nthat all those places should be fortified, with men and ammunition,\r\nwhich were commodious to land in, either out of Spain or out of\r\nFlanders, as Milford-Haven, Falmouth, Plymouth, Portland, the Isle of\r\nWight, Portsmouth, the open side of Kent, called the Downs, the Thames'\r\nmouth, Harwich, Yarmouth, Hull, &c. That trained soldiers through all\r\nthe maratime provinces should meet upon warning given, to defend the\r\nplaces; that they should by their best means, hinder the enemy from\r\nlanding; and if they did happen to land, then they were to destroy the\r\nfruits of the country all about, and spoil every thing that might be of\r\nany use to the enemy, that so they might find no more victuals than what\r\nthey brought with them. And that, by continued alarms, the enemy should\r\nfind no rest day or night. But they should not try any battle until\r\ndivers captains were met together with their companies. That one captain\r\nmight be named in every shire which might command.\r\n\r\nTwo years before, the duke of Parma, considering how hard a matter it\r\nwas to end the Belgic war, so long as it was continually nourished and\r\nsupported with aid from the queen, he moved for a treaty of peace, by\r\nthe means of Sir James Croft, one of the privy council, a man desirous\r\nof peace, and Andrew Loe, a Dutchman, and professed that the Spaniard\r\nhad delegated authority to him for this purpose. But the queen fearing\r\nthat the friendship between her and the confederate princes might be\r\ndissolved, and that so they might secretly be drawn to the Spaniard, she\r\ndeferred that treaty for some time. But now, that the wars on both sides\r\nprepared might be turned away, she was content to treat for peace; but\r\nso as still holding the weapons in her hand.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, in February, delegates were sent into Flanders, the\r\nearl of Derby, the lord Cobham, Sir James Croft, Dr. Dale, and Dr.\r\nRogers. These were received with all humanity on the duke's behalf, and\r\na place appointed for their treating, that they might see the authority\r\ndelegated to him by the Spanish king. He appointed the place near to\r\nOstend, not in Ostend, which at that time was held by the English\r\nagainst the Spanish king. His authority delegated, he promised them to\r\nshow, when they were once met together. He wished them to make good\r\nspeed in the business, lest somewhat might fall out in the mean time,\r\nwhich might trouble the motions of peace. Richardotus, spoke somewhat\r\nmore plainly, That he knew not what in this interim should be done\r\nagainst England.\r\n\r\nNot long after, Dr. Rogers was sent to the prince, by an express\r\ncommandment from the queen, to know the truth, whether the Spaniards had\r\nresolved to invade England, which he and Richardotus seemed to signify.\r\nHe affirmed, that he did not so much as think of the invasion of\r\nEngland, when he wished that the business might proceed with speed; and\r\nwas in a manner offended with Richardotus, who denied that such words\r\nfell from him.\r\n\r\nThe 12th of April, the count Aremberg, Champigny, Richardotus, Doctor\r\nMaesius, and Garnier, delegated from the prince of Parma, met with the\r\nEnglish, and yielded to them the honour both in walking and sitting.\r\n\r\nThis conference, however, came to nothing; undertaken by, the queen, as\r\nthe wiser then thought, to avert the Spanish fleet; continued by the\r\nSpaniard that he might oppress the queen, being as he supposed\r\nunprovided, and not expecting the danger. So both of them tried to use\r\ntime to their best advantages.\r\n\r\nAt length the Spanish fleet, well furnished with men, ammunition,\r\nengines, and all warlike preparations, the best, indeed, that ever was\r\nseen upon the ocean, called by the arrogant title, The Invincible\r\nArmada, consisted of 130 ships, wherein there were in all, 19,290.\r\nMariners, 8,350. Chained rowers, 11,080. Great ordnance, 11,630. The\r\nchief commander was Perezius Guzmannus, duke of Medina Sidonia; and\r\nunder him Joannes Martinus Ricaldus, a man of great experience in sea\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe 30th of May they loosed out of the river Tagus, and bending their\r\ncourse to the Groin, in Gallicia, they were beaten and scattered by a\r\ntempest, three galleys, by the help of David Gwin, an English servant,\r\nand by the perfidiousness of the Turks which rowed, were carried away\r\ninto France. The fleet, with much ado, after some days came to the\r\nGroin, and other harbours near adjoining. The report was, that the fleet\r\nwas so shaken by this tempest, that the queen was persuaded, that she\r\nwas not to expect that fleet this year. And Sir Francis Walsingham,\r\nsec'y, wrote to the lord admiral, that he might send back four of the\r\ngreatest ships, as if the war had been ended. But the lord admiral did\r\nnot easily give credit to that report; yet with a gentle answer\r\nentreated him to believe nothing hastily in so important a matter: as\r\nalso that he might be permitted to keep those ships with him which he\r\nhad, though it were upon his own charges. And getting a favourable wind,\r\nmade sail towards Spain, to surprise the enemy's damaged ships in their\r\nharbours. When he was close in with the coast of Spain, the wind\r\nshifting, and he being charged to defend the English shore, fearing that\r\nthe enemy might unseen, by the same wind, sail for England, he returned\r\nunto Plymouth.\r\n\r\nNow with the same wind, the 12th of July, the duke of Medina with his\r\nfleet departed from the Groin. And after a few days he sent Rodericus\r\nTelius into Flanders, to advertise the duke of Parma, giving him warning\r\nthat the fleet was approaching, and therefore he was to make himself\r\nready. For Medina's commission was to join himself with the ships and\r\nsoldiers of Parma; and under the protection of his fleet to bring them\r\ninto England, and to land his forces upon the Thames side.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth, day, (saith the relator,) there was a great calm, and a\r\nthick cloud was upon the sea till noon; then the north wind blowing\r\nroughly; and again the west wind till midnight, and after that the east;\r\nthe Spanish navy was scattered, and hardly gathered together until they\r\ncame within sight of England the nineteenth day of July. Upon which day,\r\nthe lord admiral was certified by Fleming, (who had been a pirate) that\r\nthe Spanish fleet was entered into the English sea, which the mariners\r\ncall the Channel, and was descried near to the Lizard. The lord admiral\r\nbrought forth the English fleet into the sea, but not without great\r\ndifficulty, by the skill, labour, and alacrity of the soldiers and\r\nmariners, every one labouring; yea, the lord admiral himself putting his\r\nhand to this work.\r\n\r\nThe next day the English fleet viewed the Spanish fleet coming along\r\nlike the towering castles in height, her front crooked like the fashion\r\nof the moon, the wings of the fleet were extended one from the other\r\nabout seven miles, or as some say eight miles asunder, sailing with the\r\nlabour of the winds, the ocean as it were groaning under it, their sail\r\nwas but slow, and yet at full sail before the wind. The English were\r\nwilling to let them hold on their course, and when they were passed by,\r\ngot behind them, and so got to windward of them.\r\n\r\nUpon the 21st of July, the lord admiral of England sent a cutter before,\r\ncalled the Defiance, to denounce the battle by firing off pieces. And\r\nbeing himself in the Royal-Arch, (the English admiral ship) he began the\r\nengagement with a ship which he took to be the Spanish admiral, but\r\nwhich was the ship of Alfonsus Leva. Upon that he expended much shot.\r\nPresently Drake, Hawkins, and Forbisher, came in upon the rear of the\r\nSpaniards which Ricaldus commanded.--Upon these they thundered. Ricaldus\r\nendeavoured, as much as in him lay, to keep his men to their quarters,\r\nbut all in vain, until his ship, much beaten and battered with many\r\nshot, hardly recovered the fleet. Then the duke of Medina gathered\r\ntogether his scattered fleet, and setting more sail, held on his course.\r\nIndeed they could do no other, for the English had gotten the advantage\r\nof the wind, and their ships being much easier managed, and ready with\r\nincredible celerity to come upon the enemy with a full course, and then\r\nto tack and retack and be on every side at their pleasure. After a long\r\nfight, and each of them had taken a trial of their courage, the lord\r\nadmiral thought proper to continue the fight no longer, because there\r\nwere forty ships more, which were then absent, and at that very time\r\nwere coming out of Plymouth Sound.\r\n\r\nThe night following, the St. Catharine, a Spanish ship, being sadly torn\r\nin the battle, was taken into the midst of the fleet to be repaired.\r\nHere a great Cantabrian ship, of Oquenda, wherein was the treasurer of\r\nthe camp, by force of gunpowder took fire, yet it was quenched in time\r\nby the ships that came to help her. Of those which came to assist the\r\nfired ship, one was a galleon, commanded by one Petrus Waldez; the\r\nfore-yard of the galleon was caught in the rigging of another ship, and\r\ncarried away. This was taken by Drake, who sent Waldez to Dartmouth, and\r\na great sum of money, viz. 55,000 ducats, which he distributed among the\r\nsoldiers. This Waldez coming into Drake's presence, kissed his hand, and\r\ntold him they had all resolved to die, if they had not been so happy as\r\nto fall into his hands whom they knew to be noble. That night he was\r\nappointed to set forth a light, but neglected it; and some German\r\nmerchant ships coming by that night, he, thinking them to be enemies,\r\nfollowed them so far, that the English fleet lay to all night, because\r\nthey could see no light set forth. Neither did he nor the rest of the\r\nfleet find the admiral until the next evening. The admiral all the\r\nnight proceeding with the Bear and the Mary Rose, carefully followed the\r\nSpaniards with watchfulness. The duke was busied in ordering his\r\nsquadron. Alfonsus Leva was commanded to join the first and last\r\ndivisions. Every ship had its proper station assigned, according to that\r\nprescribed form which was appointed in Spain; it was present death to\r\nany one who forsook his station. This done, he sent Gliclius and Anceani\r\nto Parma, which might declare to them in what situation they were, and\r\nleft that Cantabrian ship, of Oquenda, to the wind and sea, having taken\r\nout the money and mariners, and put them on board of other ships. Yet it\r\nseemed that he had not care for all; for that ship the same day, with\r\nfifty mariners and soldiers wounded and half-burned, fell into the hands\r\nof the English, and was carried to Weymouth.\r\n\r\nThe 23d of the same month, the Spaniards having a favourable north wind,\r\ntacked towards the English; but they being more expert in the management\r\nof their ships, tacked likewise, and kept the advantage they had gained,\r\nkeeping the Spaniards to leeward, till at last the fight became general\r\non both sides. They fought awhile confusedly with variable success:\r\nwhilst on the one side the English with great courage delivered the\r\nLondon ships which were enclosed about by the Spaniards; and on the\r\nother side, the Spaniards by valour freed Ricaldus from the extreme\r\ndanger he was in; great and many were the explosions, which, by the\r\ncontinued firing of great guns, were heard this day. But the loss (by\r\nthe good providence of God,) fell upon the Spaniards, their ships being\r\nso high, that the shot went over our English ships, and the English,\r\nhaving such a fair mark at their large ships, never shot in vain. During\r\nthis engagement, Cock, an Englishman, being surrounded by the Spanish\r\nships, could not be recovered, but perished; however, with great honour\r\nhe revenged himself. Thus a long time the English ships with great\r\nagility were sometimes upon the Spaniards, giving them the fire of one\r\nside, and then of the other, and presently were off again, and still\r\nkept the sea, to make themselves ready to come in again. Whereas the\r\nSpanish ships, being of great burden, were troubled and hindered, and\r\nstood to be the marks for the English shot. For all that the English\r\nadmiral would not permit his people to board their ships, because they\r\nhad such a number of soldiers on board, which he had not; their ships\r\nwere many in number, and greater, and higher, that if they had come to\r\ngrapple, as many would have had it, the English being much lower than\r\nthe Spanish ships, must needs have had the worst of them that fought\r\nfrom the higher ships. And if the English had been overcome, the loss\r\nwould have been greater than the victory could have been; for our being\r\novercome would have put the kingdom in hazard.\r\n\r\nThe 24th day of July they gave over fighting on both sides. The admiral\r\nsent some small barks to the English shore for a supply of provisions,\r\nand divided his whole fleet into four squadrons; the first whereof he\r\ntook under his own command, the next was commanded by Drake, the third\r\nby Hawkins, and the last by Forbisher. And he appointed out of every\r\nsquadron certain little ships, which, on divers sides might set upon the\r\nSpaniards in the night, but a sudden calm took them so that expedition\r\nwas without effect.\r\n\r\nThe 25th, the St. Anne, a galleon of Portugal, not being able to keep up\r\nwith the rest, was attacked by some small English ships. To whose aid\r\ncame in Leva, and Didacus Telles Enriques, with three galeasses; which\r\nthe admiral, and the Lord Thomas Howard, espying, made all the sail they\r\ncould against the galeasses, but the calm continuing, they were obliged\r\nto be towed along with their boats; as soon as they reached the\r\ngaleasses, they began to play away so fiercely with their great guns,\r\nthat with much danger, and great loss, they hardly recovered their\r\ngalleon. The Spaniards reported that the Spanish admiral was that day in\r\nthe rear of their fleet, which, being come nearer to the English ships\r\nthan before, got terribly shattered with their great guns, many men were\r\nkilled aboard, and her masts laid over the side. The Spanish admiral,\r\nafter this, in company with Ricaldus, and others, attacked the English\r\nadmiral, who, having the advantage of the wind, suddenly tacked and\r\nescaped. The Spaniards holding on their course again, sent to the duke\r\nof Parma, that with all possible speed he should join his ships with the\r\nking's fleet. These things the English knew not, who write that they had\r\ncarried away the lantern from one of the Spanish ships, the stern from\r\nanother, and sore mauled the third very much disabling her. The\r\nNon-Parigly, and the Mary Rose, fought awhile with the Spaniards, and\r\nthe Triumph being in danger, other ships came in good time to help her.\r\n\r\nThe next day the lord admiral knighted the Lord Thomas Howard, the Lord\r\nSheffield, Roger Townsend, John Hawkins, and Martin Forbisher, for their\r\nvalour in the last engagement. After this, they agreed not to attack the\r\nenemy until they came into the straits of Calais, where Henry Seimor,\r\nand William Winter, waited for their coming. Thus with a fair gale the\r\nSpanish fleet went forward, and the English followed. This great Spanish\r\nArmada was so far from being esteemed invincible in the opinion of the\r\nEnglish, that many young men and gentlemen, in hope to be partakers of a\r\nfamous victory against the Spaniards, provided ships at their own\r\nexpense, and joined themselves to the English fleet; among whom were the\r\nearls of Essex, Northumberland, and Cumberland, Thomas and Robert Cecil,\r\nHenry Brooks, William Hatton, Robert Cary, Ambrose Willoughby, Thomas\r\nGerard, Arthur George, and other gentlemen of good note and quality.\r\n\r\nThe 27th day, at even, the Spaniards cast anchor near to Calais, being\r\nadmonished by their skilful seamen, that if they went any further they\r\nmight be in danger, through the force of the tide, to be driven into the\r\nNorth Ocean. Near to them lay the English admiral with his fleet, within\r\na great gun's shot. The admiral, Seimor and Winter, now join their\r\nships; so that now there were a hundred and forty ships in the English\r\nfleet, able, and well furnished for fighting, for sailing, and every\r\nthing else which was requisite; and yet there were but fifteen of these\r\nwhich bore the heat of the battle, and repulsed the enemy. The Spaniard,\r\nas often as he had done before, so now with great earnestness sent to\r\nthe duke of Parma, to send forty fly-boats, without which they could not\r\nfight with the English, because of the greatness and slowness of their\r\nships, and the agility of the English, entreating him by all means now\r\nto come to sea with his army, which army was now to be protected as it\r\nwere, under the wings of the Spanish Armada, until they should land in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBut the duke was unprovided, and could not come out in an instant. The\r\nbroad ships with flat bottoms being then full of chinks must be mended.\r\nVictuals wanted, and must be provided. The mariners being long kept\r\nagainst their wills, began to shrink away. The ports of Dunkirk and\r\nNewport, by which he must bring his army to the sea, were now so beset\r\nwith the strong ships of Holland and Zealand, which were furnished with\r\ngreat and small munition, that he was not able to come to sea, unless he\r\nwould come upon his own apparent destruction, and cast himself and his\r\nmen wilfully into a headlong danger. Yet he omitted nothing that might\r\nbe done, being a man eager and industrious, and inflamed with a desire\r\nof overcoming England.\r\n\r\nBut queen Elizabeth's providence and care prevented both the diligence\r\nof this man, and the credulous hope of the Spaniard; for by her command\r\nthe next day the admiral took eight of their worst ships, charging the\r\nordnance therein up to the mouth with small shot, nails, and stones, and\r\ndressed them with wild fire, pitch, and rosin, and filling them full of\r\nbrimstone, and some other matter fit for fire, and these being set on\r\nfire by the management of Young and Prowse, were secretly in the night,\r\nby the help of the wind, set full upon the Spanish fleet, which, on\r\nSunday, the seventh of August, they sent in among them as they lay at\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spanish saw them come near, the flames giving light all over\r\nthe sea, they supposing those ships, besides the danger of fire, to have\r\nbeen also furnished with deadly engines, to make horrible destruction\r\namong them; lifting up a most hideous cry, some pull up anchors, some\r\nfor haste cut their cables, they set up their sails, they apply their\r\noars, and stricken with extreme terror, in great haste they fled most\r\nconfusedly. Among them the Pretorian Galleass floating upon the seas,\r\nher rudder being broken, in great danger and fear drew towards Calais,\r\nand striking in the sand, was taken by Amias Preston, Thomas Gerard, and\r\nHarvey; Hugh Moncada the governor was slain, the soldiers and mariners\r\nwere either killed or drowned; in her there was found great store of\r\ngold, which fell to be the prey of the English. The ship and ordnance\r\nwent to the governor of Calais.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards report, that the duke, when he saw the fire ships coming,\r\ncommanded all the fleet to heave up their anchors, but so as the danger\r\nbeing past, every ship might return again to his own station; and he\r\nhimself returned, giving a sign to the rest by shooting off a gun; which\r\nwas heard but by a few, for they were far off scattered some into the\r\nopen ocean, some through fear were driven upon the shallows of the coast\r\nof Flanders.\r\n\r\nOver against Gravelling the Spanish fleet began to gather themselves\r\ntogether. But upon them came Drake and Fenner, and battered them with\r\ngreat ordnance: to these Fenton, Southwel, Beeston, Cross, Riman, and\r\npresently after the lord admiral, and Sheffield, came in. The Duke\r\nMedina, Leva, Oquenda, Ricaldus, and others, with much ado in getting\r\nthemselves out of the shallows, sustained the English ships as well as\r\nthey might, until most of their ships were pierced and torn; the galleon\r\nSt. Matthew, governed by Diego Pimentellas, coming to aid Francis\r\nToleton, being in the St. Philip, was pierced and shaken with the\r\nreiterated shots of Seimor and Winter, and driven to Ostend, and was at\r\nlast taken by the Flushingers. The St. Philip came to the like end; so\r\ndid the galleon of Biscay, and divers others.\r\n\r\nThe last day of this month, the Spanish fleet striving to recover the\r\nstraits again, were driven towards Zealand. The English left off\r\npursuing them, as the Spaniards thought, because they saw them in a\r\nmanner cast away; for they could not avoid the shallows of Zealand. But\r\nthe wind turning, they got them out of the shallows, and then began to\r\nconsult what were best for them to do. By common consent they resolved\r\nto return into Spain by the Northern Seas, for they wanted many\r\nnecessaries, especially shot; their ships were torn, and they had no\r\nhope that the duke of Parma could bring forth his forces. And so they\r\ntook the sea, and followed the course toward the north. The English navy\r\nfollowed, and sometimes the Spanish turned upon the English, insomuch\r\nthat it was thought by many that they would turn back again.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth caused an army to encamp at Tilbury. After the army had\r\ncome thither, her majesty went in person to visit the camp, which then\r\nlay between the city of London and the sea, under the charge of the earl\r\nof Leicester, where placing herself between the enemy and her city, she\r\nviewed her army, passing through it divers times, and lodging in the\r\nborders of it, returned again and dined in the army. Afterwards when\r\nthey were all reduced into battle, prepared as it were for fight, she\r\nrode round about with a leader's staff in her hand, only accompanied\r\nwith the general, and three or four others attending upon her.[A]\r\n\r\nI could enlarge the description hereof with many more particulars of\r\nmine own observation, (says the author,) for I wandered, as many others\r\ndid, from place to place, all the day, and never heard a word spoke of\r\nher, but in praising her for her stately person and princely behaviour,\r\nin praying for her long life, and earnestly desiring to venture their\r\nlives for her safety. In her presence they sung psalms of praise to\r\nAlmighty God, for which she greatly commended them, and devoutly praised\r\nGod with them. This that I write, you may be sure I do not with any\r\ncomfort, but to give you these manifest arguments that neither this\r\nqueen did discontent her people, nor her people show any discontent in\r\nany thing they were commanded to do for her service, as heretofore hath\r\nbeen imagined.\r\n\r\nThis account was related by a popish spy, in a letter written here in\r\nEngland to Mendea. The copy of which letter was found upon Richard\r\nLeigh, a seminary priest in French and English: which priest was\r\nexecuted for high treason while the Spanish Armada was at sea.\r\n\r\nThe same day whereon the last fight was, the duke of Parma, after his\r\nvows offered to the lady of Halla, came somewhat late to Dunkirk, and\r\nwas received with very opprobrious language by the Spaniards, as if in\r\nfavour of queen Elizabeth he had slipped the fairest opportunity that\r\ncould be to do the service. He, to make some satisfaction, punished the\r\npurveyors that had not made provision of beer, bread, &c. which was not\r\nyet ready nor embarked, secretly smiling at the insolence of the\r\nSpaniards, when he heard them bragging that what way soever they came\r\nupon England, they would have an undoubted victory; that the English\r\nwere not able to endure the sight of them. The English admiral appointed\r\nSeimor and the Hollanders to watch upon the coast of Flanders that the\r\nduke of Parma should not come out; whilst he himself close followed the\r\nSpaniards until they were past Edinburgh Frith.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, seeing all hopes fail, fled amain; and so this great\r\nnavy, being three years preparing with great expense, was within one\r\nmonth overthrown, and, after many were killed, being chased again, was\r\ndriven about all England, by Scotland, the Oreades, and Ireland, tossed\r\nand damaged with tempests, much diminished, and went home without glory.\r\nThere were not a hundred men of the English lost, and but one ship.\r\nWhereupon money was coined with a navy fleeing away in full sail, with\r\nthis inscription, _Venit, Vidit, Fugit_. Others were coined with the\r\nships on fire, the navy confounded, inscribed, in honour of the queen,\r\n_Dux Faemina Facti_. As they fled, it is certain that many of their ships\r\nwere cast away upon the shores of Scotland and Ireland. About seven\r\nhundred soldiers and mariners were cast away upon the Scottish shore,\r\nwho, at the duke of Parma's intercession with the Scotch king, the queen\r\nof England consenting, were after a year sent into Flanders. But they\r\nthat were cast upon the Irish shore came to more miserable fortunes, for\r\nsome were killed by the wild Irish, and others were destroyed for fear\r\nthey should join themselves with the wild Irish, (which cruelty queen\r\nElizabeth much condemned,) and the rest being afraid, sick and hungry,\r\nwith their disabled ships, committed themselves to the sea, and many\r\nwere drowned.\r\n\r\nThe queen went to public thanksgiving in St. Paul's church, accompanied\r\nby a glorious train of nobility, through the streets of London, which\r\nwere hung with blue cloth, the companies standing on both sides in their\r\nliveries; the banners that were taken from the enemies were spread; she\r\nheard the sermon, and public thanks were rendered unto God with great\r\njoy. This public joy was augmented when Sir Robert Sidney returned from\r\nScotland, and brought from the king assurances of his noble mind and\r\naffection to the queen, and to religion; which as in sincerity he had\r\nestablished, so he purposed to maintain with all his power. Sir Robert\r\nSidney was sent to him when the Spanish fleet was coming, to\r\ncongratulate and return thanks for his great affection towards the\r\nmaintenance of the common cause, and to declare how ready she would be\r\nto help him if the Spaniards should land in Scotland; and that he might\r\nrecal to memory with what strange ambition the Spaniards had gaped for\r\nall Britain, urging the pope to excommunicate him, to the end that he\r\nmight be thrust from the kingdom of Scotland, and from the succession in\r\nEngland: and to give him notice of the threatening of Mendoza, and the\r\npope's nuncio, who threatened his ruin if they could effect it: and\r\ntherefore warned him to take special heed to the Scottish papists.\r\n\r\nThe king pleasantly answered that he looked for no other benefit from\r\nthe Spaniards, than that which Polyphemus promised to Ulysses, to devour\r\nhim last after his fellows were devoured.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper here to subjoin a list of the different articles\r\ntaken on board the Spanish ships, designed for the tormenting of the\r\nprotestants, had their scheme taken effect.\r\n\r\n1. The common soldiers' pikes, eighteen feet long, pointed with long\r\nsharp spikes, and shod with iron, which were designed to keep off the\r\nhorse, to facilitate the landing of the infantry.\r\n\r\n2. A great number of lances used by the Spanish officers. These were\r\nformerly gilt, but the gold is almost worn off by cleaning.\r\n\r\n3. The Spanish ranceurs, made in different forms, which were intended\r\neither to kill the men on horseback, or pull them off their horses.\r\n\r\n4. A very singular piece of arms, being a pistol in a shield, so\r\ncontrived as to fire the pistol, and cover the body at the same time,\r\nwith the shield. It is to be fired by a match-lock, and the sight of the\r\nenemy is to be taken through a little grate in the shield, which is\r\npistol proof.\r\n\r\n5. The banner, with a crucifix upon it, which was to have been carried\r\nbefore the Spanish general. On it is engraved the pope's benediction\r\nbefore the Spanish fleet sailed: for the pope came to the water side,\r\nand, on seeing the fleet, blessed it, and styled it _invincible_.\r\n\r\n6. The Spanish cravats, as they are called. These are engines of\r\ntorture, made of iron, and put on board to lock together the feet, arms\r\nand heads of Englishmen.\r\n\r\n7. Spanish bilboes, made of iron likewise, to yoke the English prisoners\r\ntwo and two.\r\n\r\n8. Spanish shot, which are of four sorts: pike-shot, star-shot,\r\nchain-shot, and link-shot, all admirably contrived, as well for the\r\ndestruction of the masts and rigging of ships, as for sweeping the decks\r\nof their men.\r\n\r\n9. Spanish spadas poisoned at the points, so that if a man received the\r\nslightest wound with one of them, certain death was the consequence.\r\n\r\n10. A Spanish poll-axe, used in boarding of ships.\r\n\r\n11. Thumb-screws, of which there were several chests full on board the\r\nSpanish fleet. The use they were intended for is said to have been to\r\nextort confession from the English where their money was hid.\r\n\r\n12. The Spanish morning star; a destructive engine resembling the figure\r\nof a star, of which there were many thousands on board, and all of them\r\nwith poisoned points; and were designed to strike at the enemy as they\r\ncame on board, in case of a close attack.\r\n\r\n13. The Spanish general's halberd, covered with velvet. All the nails of\r\nthis weapon are double gilt with gold; and on its top is the pope's\r\nhead, curiously engraved.\r\n\r\n14. A Spanish battle-axe, so contrived, as to strike four holes in a\r\nman's head at once; and has besides a pistol in its handle, with a\r\nmatch-lock.\r\n\r\n15. The Spanish general's shield, carried before him as an ensign of\r\nhonour. On it are depicted, in most curious workmanship, the labours of\r\nHercules, and other expressive allegories.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spanish prisoners were asked by some of the English what their\r\nintentions were, had their expedition succeeded, they replied, \"To\r\nextirpate the whole from the island, at least all heretics (as they\r\ncalled the protestants,) and to send their souls to hell.\" Strange\r\ninfatuation! Ridiculous bigotry! How prejudiced must the minds of those\r\nmen be, who would wish to destroy their fellow-creatures, not only in\r\nthis world, but, if it were possible, in that which is to come, merely\r\nbecause they refused to believe on certain subjects as the Spaniards\r\nthemselves did.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A conspiracy by the Papists for the destruction of James I., the royal\r\nfamily, and both houses of Parliament; commonly known by the name of the\r\nGunpowder Plot._\r\n\r\nThe papists (of which there were great numbers in England at the time of\r\nthe intended Spanish invasion) were so irritated at the failure of that\r\nexpedition, that they were determined, if possible, to project a scheme\r\nat home, that might answer the purposes, to some degree, of their\r\nblood-thirsty competitors. The vigorous administration of Elizabeth,\r\nhowever, prevented their carrying any of their iniquitous designs into\r\nexecution, although they made many attempts with that view. The\r\ncommencement of the reign of her successor was destined to be the era of\r\na plot, the barbarity of which transcends every thing related in ancient\r\nor modern history.\r\n\r\nIn order to crush popery in the most effectual manner in this kingdom,\r\nJames soon after his succession, took proper measures for eclipsing the\r\npower of the Roman Catholics, by enforcing those laws which had been\r\nmade against them by his predecessors. This enraged the papists to such\r\na degree, that a conspiracy was formed, by some of the principal\r\nleaders, of the most daring and impious nature; namely, to blow up the\r\nking, royal family, and both houses of parliament, while in full\r\nsession, and thus to involve the nation in utter and inevitable ruin.\r\n\r\nThe cabal who formed the resolution of putting in practice this horrid\r\nscheme, consisted of the following persons:--Henry Garnet, an\r\nEnglishman, who, about the year 1586, had been sent to England as\r\nsuperior of the English Jesuits; Catesby, an English gentleman; Tesmond,\r\na Jesuit; Thomas Wright; two gentlemen of the name of Winter; Thomas\r\nPercy, a near relation of the earl of Northumberland; Guido Fawkes, a\r\nbold and enterprising soldier of fortune; Sir Edward Digby; John Grant,\r\nEsq.; Francis Tresham, Esq.; Robert Keyes and Thomas Bates, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMost of these were men both of birth and fortune; and Catesby, who had a\r\nlarge estate, had already expended two thousand pounds in several\r\nvoyages to the court of Spain, in order to introduce an army of\r\nSpaniards into England, for overturning the protestant government, and\r\nrestoring the Roman Catholic religion; but, being disappointed in this\r\nproject of an invasion, he took an opportunity of disclosing to Percy\r\n(who was his intimate friend, and who, in a sudden fit of passion, had\r\nhinted a design of assassinating the king) a nobler and more extensive\r\nplan of treason, such as would include a sure execution of vengeance,\r\nand, at one blow, consign over to destruction all their enemies.\r\n\r\nPercy assented to the project proposed by Catesby, and they resolved to\r\nimpart the matter to a few more, and, by degrees, to all the rest of\r\ntheir cabal, every man being bound by an oath, and taking the sacrament\r\n(the most sacred rite of their religion), not to disclose the least\r\nsyllable of the matter, or to withdraw from the association, without the\r\nconsent of all persons concerned.\r\n\r\nThese consultations were held in the spring and summer of the year 1604,\r\nand it was towards the close of that year that they began their\r\noperations; the manner of which, and the discovery, we shall relate with\r\nas much brevity as is consistent with perspicuity.\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed that a few of the conspirators should run a mine\r\nbelow the hall in which the parliament was to assemble, and that they\r\nshould choose the very moment when the king should deliver his speech to\r\nboth houses, for springing the mine, and thus, by one blow cut off the\r\nking, the royal family, lords, commons, and all the other enemies of the\r\ncatholic religion in that very spot where that religion has been most\r\noppressed. For this purpose, Percy, who was at that time a\r\ngentleman-pensioner undertook to hire a house adjoining to the upper\r\nhouse of parliament with all diligence. This was accordingly done, and\r\nthe conspirators expecting the parliament would meet on the 17th of\r\nFebruary following, began, on the 11th of December, to dig in the\r\ncellar, through the wall of partition, which was three yards thick.\r\nThere was seven in number joined in this labour: they went in by night,\r\nand never after appeared in sight, for, having supplied themselves with\r\nall necessary provisions, they had no occasion to go out. In case of\r\ndiscovery, they had provided themselves with powder, shot, and fire\r\narms, and formed a resolution rather to die than be taken.\r\n\r\nOn Candlemas-day, 1605, they had dug so far through the wall as to be\r\nable to hear a noise on the other side: upon which unexpected event,\r\nfearing a discovery, Guido Fawkes, (who personated Percy's footman,) was\r\ndespatched to know the occasion, and returned with the favourable\r\nreport, that the place from whence the noise came was a large cellar\r\nunder the upper house of parliament, full of sea-coal which was then on\r\nsale, and the cellar offered to be let.\r\n\r\nOn this information, Percy immediately hired the cellar, and bought the\r\nremainder of the coals: he then sent for thirty barrels of gunpowder\r\nfrom Holland, and landing them at Lambeth, conveyed them gradually by\r\nnight to this cellar, where they were covered with stones, iron bars, a\r\nthousand billets, and five hundred fagots; all which they did at their\r\nleisure, the parliament being prorogued to the 5th of November.\r\n\r\nThis being done, the conspirators next consulted how they should secure\r\nthe duke of York,[B] who was too young to be expected at the parliament\r\nhouse, and his sister, the Princess Elizabeth, educated at Lord\r\nHarrington's, in Warwickshire. It was resolved, that Percy and another\r\nshould enter into the duke's chamber, and a dozen more, properly\r\ndisposed at several doors, with two or three on horseback at the\r\ncourt-gate to receive him, should carry him safe away as soon as the\r\nparliament-house was blown up; or, if that could not be effected, that\r\nthey should kill him, and declare the princess Elizabeth queen, having\r\nsecured her, under pretence of a hunting-match, that day.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the conspirators proposed obtaining foreign aid previous to\r\nthe execution of their design; but this was over-ruled, and it was\r\nagreed only to apply to France, Spain, and other powers for assistance\r\nafter the plot had taken effect; they also resolved to proclaim the\r\nprincess Elizabeth queen, and to spread a report, after the blow was\r\ngiven, that the puritans were the perpetrators of so inhuman an action.\r\n\r\nAll matters being now prepared by the conspirators, they, without the\r\nleast remorse of conscience, and with the utmost impatience, expected\r\nthe 5th of November. But all their counsels were blasted by a happy and\r\nprovidential circumstance. One of the conspirators, having a desire to\r\nsave William Parker, Lord Monteagle, sent him the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"My Lord,\r\n\r\n    \"Out of the love I bear to some of your friends, I\r\n    have a care for your preservation; therefore I\r\n    advise you, as you tender your life, to devise you\r\n    some excuse to shift off your attendance at this\r\n    parliament; for God and man have concurred to\r\n    punish the wickedness of this time: and think not\r\n    slightly of this advertisement, but retire yourself\r\n    into the country, where you may expect the event\r\n    with safety, for though there be no appearance of\r\n    any stir, yet I say they shall receive a terrible\r\n    blow, this parliament, and yet they shall not see\r\n    who hurts them. This counsel is not to be\r\n    contemned, because it may do you good, and can do\r\n    you no harm; for the danger is past so soon (or as\r\n    quickly) as you burn this letter; and I hope God\r\n    will give you the grace to make good use of it, to\r\n    whose holy protection I commend you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord Monteagle was, for some time, at a loss what judgment to form\r\nof this letter, and unresolved whether he should slight the\r\nadvertisement or not; and fancying it a trick of his enemies to frighten\r\nhim into an absence from parliament, would have determined on the\r\nformer, had his own safety been only in question: but apprehending the\r\nking's life might be in danger, he took the letter at midnight to the\r\nearl of Salisbury, who was equally puzzled about the meaning of it; and\r\nthough he was inclined to think it merely a wild and waggish contrivance\r\nto alarm Monteagle, yet he thought proper to consult about it with the\r\nearl of Suffolk, lord chamberlain. The expression, \"that the blow should\r\ncome, without knowing who hurt them,\" made them imagine that it would\r\nnot be more proper than the time of parliament, nor by any other way\r\nlikely to be attempted than by gunpowder, while the king was sitting to\r\nthat assembly: the lord chamberlain thought this the more probable,\r\nbecause there was a great cellar under the parliament-chamber, (as\r\nalready mentioned,) never used for any thing but wood or coal, belonging\r\nto Wineyard, the keeper of the palace; and having communicated the\r\nletter to the earls of Nottingham, Worcester, and Northampton, they\r\nproceeded no farther till the king came from Royston, on the 1st of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nHis majesty being shown the letter by the earls, who, at the same time\r\nacquainted him with their suspicions, was of opinion that either nothing\r\nshould be done, or else enough to prevent the danger: and that a search\r\nshould be made on the day preceding that designed for this execution of\r\nthe diabolical enterprise.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on Monday, the 4th of November, in the afternoon, the lord\r\nchamberlain, whose office it was to see all things put in readiness for\r\nthe king's coming, accompanied by Monteagle, went to visit all places\r\nabout the parliament-house, and taking a slight occasion to see the\r\ncellar, observed only piles of billets and fagots, but in greater number\r\nthan he thought Wineyard could want for his own use. On his asking who\r\nowned the wood, and being told it belonged to one Mr. Percy, he began to\r\nhave some suspicions, knowing him to be a rigid papist, and so seldom\r\nthere, that he had no occasion for such a quantity of fuel; and\r\nMonteagle confirmed him therein, by observing that Percy had made him\r\ngreat professions of friendship.\r\n\r\nThough there was no other materials visible, yet Suffolk thought it was\r\nnecessary to make a further search; and, upon his return to the king, a\r\nresolution was taken that it should be made in such a manner as should\r\nbe effectual, without scandalizing any body, or giving any alarm.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Knevet, steward of Westminster, was accordingly ordered,\r\nunder the pretext of searching for stolen tapestry hangings in that\r\nplace, and other houses thereabouts, to remove the wood, and see if\r\nanything was concealed underneath. This gentleman going at midnight,\r\nwith several attendants, to the cellar, met Fawkes, just coming out of\r\nit, booted and spurred, with a tinder-box and three matches in his\r\npockets, and seizing him without any ceremony, or asking him any\r\nquestions, as soon as the removal of the wood discovered the barrels of\r\ngunpowder, he caused him to be bound, and properly secured.\r\n\r\nFawkes, who was a hardened and intrepid villain, made no hesitation of\r\navowing the design, and that it was to have been executed on the morrow.\r\nHe made the same acknowledgment at his examination before a committee of\r\nthe council; and though he did not deny having some associates in this\r\nconspiracy, yet no threats of torture could make him discover any of\r\nthem, he declaring that \"he was ready to die, and had rather suffer ten\r\nthousand deaths, than willingly accuse his master, or any other.\"\r\n\r\nBy repeated examinations, however, and assurances of his master's being\r\napprehended, he at length acknowledged, \"that whilst he was abroad,\r\nPercy had kept the keys of the cellar, had been in it since the powder\r\nhad been laid there, and, in effect, that he was one of the principal\r\nactors in the intended tragedy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time it was found out, that Percy had come post out of the\r\nnorth on Saturday night, the 2d of November, and had dined on Monday at\r\nSion-house, with the earl of Northumberland; that Fawkes had met him on\r\nthe road, and that, after the lord chamberlain had been that evening in\r\nthe cellar, he went, about six o'clock, to his master, who had fled\r\nimmediately, apprehending the plot was detected.\r\n\r\nThe news of the discovery immediately spreading, the conspirators fled\r\ndifferent ways, but chiefly into Warwickshire, where Sir Everard Digby\r\nhad appointed a hunting-match, near Dunchurch, to get a number of\r\nrecusants together, sufficient to seize the princess Elizabeth; but this\r\ndesign was prevented by her taking refuge in Coventry; and their whole\r\nparty, making about one hundred, retired to Holbeach, the seat of Sir\r\nStephen Littleton, on the borders of Staffordshire, having broken open\r\nstables, and taken horses from different people in the adjoining\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Walsh, high sheriff of Worcestershire, pursued them to\r\nHolbeach, where he invested them, and summoned them to surrender. In\r\npreparing for their defence, they put some moist powder before a fire to\r\ndry, and a spark from the coals setting it on fire, some of the\r\nconspirators were so burned in their faces, thighs, and arms, that they\r\nwere scarcely able to handle their weapons. Their case was desperate,\r\nand no means of escape appearing, unless by forcing their way through\r\nthe assailants, they made a furious sally for that purpose. Catesby (who\r\nfirst proposed the manner of the plot) and Percy were both killed.\r\nThomas Winter, Grant, Digby, Rockwood, and Bates, were taken and carried\r\nto London, were the first made a full discovery of the conspiracy.\r\nTresham, lurking about the city, and frequently shifting his quarters,\r\nwas apprehended soon after, and having confessed the whole matter, died\r\nof the strangury, in the Tower. The earl of Northumberland, suspected on\r\naccount of his being related to Thomas Percy, was, by way of precaution,\r\ncommitted to the custody of the archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth;\r\nand was afterwards fined thirty thousand pounds, and sent to the Tower,\r\nfor admitting Percy into the band of gentlemen pensioners, without\r\ntending him the oath of supremacy.\r\n\r\nSome escaped to Calais, and arriving there with others, who fled to\r\navoid a persecution which they apprehended on this occasion, were kindly\r\nreceived by the governor; but one of them declaring before him, that he\r\nwas not so much concerned at his exile, as that the powder plot did not\r\ntake effect, the governor was so much incensed at his glorying in such\r\nan execrable piece of iniquity, that, in a sudden impulse of\r\nindignation, he endeavoured to throw him into the sea.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of January, 1606, eight of the conspirators were tried and\r\nconvicted, among whom was Sir Everard Digby, the only one that pleaded\r\nguilty to the indictment, though all the rest had confessed their guilt\r\nbefore. Digby was executed on the 30th of the same month, with Robert\r\nWinter, Grant, and Bates, at the west end of St. Paul's churchyard;\r\nThomas Winter, Keyes, Rockwood, and Fawkes, were executed the following\r\nday in Old Palace yard.\r\n\r\nGarnet was tried on the 28th of March, \"for his knowledge and\r\nconcealment of the conspiracy; for administering an oath of secrecy to\r\nthe conspirators, for persuading them of the lawfulness of the treason,\r\nand for praying for the success of the great action in hand at the\r\nbeginning of the parliament.\" Being found guilty,[C] he received\r\nsentence of death, but was not executed till the 3d of May, when,\r\nconfessing his own guilt, and the iniquity of the enterprise, he\r\nexhorted all Roman Catholics to abstain from the like treasonable\r\npractices in future. Gerard and Hall, two Jesuits, got abroad; and\r\nLittleton, with several others, were executed in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Monteagle had a grant of two hundred pounds a year in land, and\r\na pension of five hundred pounds for life, as a reward for discovering\r\nthe letter which gave the first hint of the conspiracy; and the\r\nanniversary of this providential deliverance was ordered to be for ever\r\ncommemorated by prayer and thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nThus was this diabolical scheme happily rendered abortive, and the\r\nauthors of it brought to that condign punishment which their wickedness\r\nmerited. In this affair Providence manifestly interposed in behalf of\r\nthe protestants, and saved them from that destruction which must have\r\ntaken place had the scheme succeeded according to the wishes of a\r\nbigoted, superstitious, and blood-thirsty faction.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The queen made the following animated speech to the troops assembled\r\nat Tilbury:\r\n\r\n\"My loving people, we have been persuaded by some, that are careful of\r\nour safety, to take heed how we commit ourselves to armed multitudes,\r\nfor fear of treachery, but I assure you, I do not desire to live to\r\ndistrust my faithful and loving people.--Let tyrants fear: I have always\r\nso behaved myself, that under God, I have placed my chiefest strength\r\nand safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects. And\r\ntherefore I am come among you at this time, not as for my recreation or\r\nsport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of the battle, to live\r\nor die among you all, to lay down, for my God, and for my kingdom, and\r\nfor my people, my honour and my blood, even in the dust. I know I have\r\nbut the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart of a king,\r\nand of a king of England too; and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain,\r\nor any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realms:\r\nTo which rather than any dishonour should grow by me, I myself will take\r\nup arms; I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one\r\nof your virtues in the field. I know already, by your forwardness, that\r\nyou have deserved rewards and crowns; and I do assure you, on the word\r\nof a prince, they shall be duly paid you. In the mean time my\r\nlieutenant-general shall be in my stead, than whom never prince\r\ncommanded a more noble and worthy subject; not doubting by your\r\nobedience to my general, by your concord in the camp, and your valour in\r\nthe field, we shall shortly have a famous victory over those enemies of\r\nmy God, of my kingdom, and of my people.\"\r\n\r\n[B] Afterward Charles I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nRISE AND PROGRESS OF THE PROTESTANT RELIGION IN IRELAND; WITH AN ACCOUNT\r\nOF THE BARBAROUS MASSACRE OF 1641.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gloom of popery had overshadowed Ireland from its first\r\nestablishment there till the reign of Henry VIII. when the rays of the\r\ngospel began to dispel the darkness, and afford that light which till\r\nthen had been unknown in that island. The abject ignorance in which the\r\npeople were held, with the absurd and superstitious notions they\r\nentertained, were sufficiently evident to many; and the artifices of\r\ntheir priests were so conspicuous, that several persons of distinction,\r\nwho had hitherto been strenuous papists, would willingly have\r\nendeavoured to shake off the yoke, and embrace the protestant religion;\r\nbut the natural ferocity of the people, and their strong attachment to\r\nthe ridiculous doctrines which they had been taught, made the attempt\r\ndangerous. It was, however, at length undertaken, though attended with\r\nthe most horrid and disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the protestant religion into Ireland may be\r\nprincipally attributed to George Browne, an Englishman, who was\r\nconsecrated archbishop of Dublin on the 19th of March, 1535. He had\r\nformerly been an Augustine friar, and was promoted to the mitre on\r\naccount of his merit.\r\n\r\nAfter having enjoyed his dignity about five years, he, at the time that\r\nHenry VIII. was suppressing the religious houses in England, caused all\r\nthe relics and images to be removed out of the two cathedrals in Dublin,\r\nand the other churches in his diocese; in the place of which he caused\r\nto be put up the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the ten commandments.\r\n\r\nA short time after this he received a letter from Thomas Cromwell,\r\nlord-privy seal, informing him that Henry VIII. having thrown off the\r\npapal supremacy in England, was determined to do the like in Ireland;\r\nand that he thereupon had appointed him (archbishop Browne) one of the\r\ncommissioners for seeing this order put in execution. The archbishop\r\nanswered, that he had employed his utmost endeavours at the hazard of\r\nhis life, to cause the Irish nobility and gentry to acknowledge Henry as\r\ntheir supreme head, in matters both spiritual and temporal; but had met\r\nwith a most violent opposition, especially from George, archbishop of\r\nArmagh; that this prelate had, in a speech to his clergy, laid a curse\r\non all those who should own his highness'[D] supremacy: adding, that\r\ntheir isle, called in the Chronicles _Insula Sacra_, or the Holy Island,\r\nbelonged to none but the bishop of Rome, and that the king's progenitors\r\nhad received it from the pope. He observed likewise, that the archbishop\r\nand clergy of Armagh, had each despatched a courier to Rome; and that it\r\nwould be necessary for a parliament to be called in Ireland, to pass an\r\nact of supremacy, the people not regarding the king's commission without\r\nthe sanction of the legislative assembly. He concluded with observing,\r\nthat the popes had kept the people in the most profound ignorance; that\r\nthe clergy were exceedingly illiterate; that the common people were more\r\nzealous, in their blindness, than the saints and martyrs had been in the\r\ndefence of truth at the beginning of the gospel; and that it was to be\r\nfeared Shan O'Neal, a chieftain of great power in the northern part of\r\nthe island, was decidedly opposed to the king's commission.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this advice, the following year a parliament was\r\nsummoned to meet at Dublin, by order of Leonard Grey, at that time\r\nlord-lieutenant. At this assembly archbishop Browne made a speech in\r\nwhich he set forth, that the bishops of Rome used, anciently, to\r\nacknowledge emperors, kings, and princes, to be supreme in their own\r\ndominions, and, therefore, that he himself would vote king Henry VIII.\r\nas supreme in all matters, both ecclesiastical and temporal. He\r\nconcluded with saying, that whosoever should refuse to vote for this\r\nact, was not a true subject of the king. This speech greatly startled\r\nthe other bishops and lords; but at length, after violent debates, the\r\nking's supremacy was allowed.\r\n\r\nTwo years after this, the archbishop wrote a second letter to lord\r\nCromwell, complaining of the clergy, and hinting at the machinations\r\nwhich the pope was then carrying on against the advocates of the gospel.\r\nThis letter is dated from Dublin, in April, 1538; and among other\r\nmatters, the archbishop says, \"A bird may be taught to speak with as\r\nmuch sense as many of the clergy do in this country. These, though not\r\nscholars, yet are crafty to cozen the poor common people and to dissuade\r\nthem from following his highness' orders. The country folk here much\r\nhate your lordship, and despitefully call you, in their Irish tongue,\r\nthe Blacksmith's Son. As a friend, I desire your lordship to look well\r\nto your noble person. Rome hath a great kindness for the duke of\r\nNorfolk, and great favors for this nation, purposely to oppose his\r\nhighness.\"\r\n\r\nA short time after this, the pope sent over to Ireland (directed to the\r\nArchbishop of Armagh and his clergy) a bull of excommunication against\r\nall who had, or should own the king's supremacy within the Irish nation;\r\ndenouncing a curse on all of them, and theirs, who should not, within\r\nforty days, acknowledge to their confessors, that they had done amiss in\r\nso doing.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Browne gave notice of this in a letter, dated, Dublin, May,\r\n1538. Part of the form of confession, or vow, sent over to these Irish\r\npapists, ran as follows; \"I do farther declare him or her, father or\r\nmother, brother or sister, son or daughter, husband or wife, uncle or\r\naunt, nephew or niece, kinsman or kinswoman, master or mistress, and all\r\nothers, nearest or dearest relations, friend or acquaintance whatsoever,\r\naccursed, that either do or shall hold, for the time to come, any\r\necclesiastical or civil power above the authority of the mother church;\r\nor that do or shall obey, for the time to come, any of her the mother of\r\nchurches' opposers or enemies, or contrary to the same, of which I have\r\nhere sworn unto: so God, the Blessed Virgin, St. Peter, St. Paul, and\r\nthe Holy Evangelists, help me, &c.\" This is an exact agreement with the\r\ndoctrines promulgated by the councils of Lateran and Constance, which\r\nexpressly declare, that no favour should be shown to heretics, nor faith\r\nkept with them; that they ought to be excommunicated and condemned, and\r\ntheir estates confiscated; and that princes are obliged, by a solemn\r\noath, to root them out of their respective dominions.\r\n\r\nHow abominable a church must that be, which thus dares to trample upon\r\nall authority! how besotted the people who regard the injunctions of\r\nsuch a church!\r\n\r\nIn the archbishop's last-mentioned letter, dated May, 1538, he says,\r\n\"His highness' viceroy of this nation is of little or no power with the\r\nold natives. Now both English and Irish begin to oppose your lordship's\r\norders, and to lay aside their national quarrels, which I fear will (if\r\nany thing will) cause a foreigner to invade this nation.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after this, Archbishop Browne seized one Thady O'Brian, a\r\nFranciscan friar, who had in his possession a paper sent from Rome dated\r\nMay, 1538, and directed to O'Neal. In this letter were the following\r\nwords: \"His holiness, Paul, now pope, and the council of the fathers,\r\nhave lately found, in Rome, a prophecy of one St. Lacerianus, an Irish\r\nbishop of Cashel, in which he saith, that the mother church of Rome\r\nfalleth, when, in Ireland, the catholic faith is overcome. Therefore,\r\nfor the glory of the mother church, the honour of St. Peter, and your\r\nown secureness, suppress heresy, and his holiness' enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThis Thady O'Brian, after farther examination and search made, was\r\npilloried, and kept close prisoner, till the king's orders arrived in\r\nwhat manner he should be farther disposed of. But order coming over from\r\nEngland that he was to be hanged, he laid violent hands on himself in\r\nthe castle of Dublin. His body was afterwards carried to Gallows-green,\r\nwhere, after being hanged up for some time, it was interred.\r\n\r\nAfter the accession of Edward VI. to the throne of England, an order was\r\ndirected to Sir Anthony Leger, the lord-deputy of Ireland, commanding\r\nthat the liturgy in English be forthwith set up in Ireland, there to be\r\nobserved within the several bishoprics, cathedrals, and parish churches;\r\nand it was first read in Christ-church, Dublin, on Easter day, 1551,\r\nbefore the said Sir Anthony, Archbishop Browne, and others. Part of the\r\nroyal order for this purpose was as follows: \"Whereas, our gracious\r\nfather, King Henry VIII. taking into consideration the bondage and heavy\r\nyoke that his true and faithful subjects sustained, under the\r\njurisdiction of the bishop of Rome; how several fabulous stories and\r\nlying wonders misled our subjects; dispensing with the sins of our\r\nnations, by their indulgences and pardons, for gain; purposely to\r\ncherish all evil vices, as robberies, rebellions, theft, whoredoms,\r\nblasphemy, idolatry, &c. our gracious father hereupon dissolved all\r\npriories, monasteries, abbeys, and other pretended religious houses; as\r\nbeing but nurseries for vice or luxury, more than for sacred learning,\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the common-prayer was first used in Christ-church,\r\nDublin, the following wicked scheme was projected by the papists:\r\n\r\nIn the church was left a marble image of Christ, holding a reed in his\r\nhand, with a crown of thorns on his head. Whilst the English service\r\n(the Common Prayer) was being read before the lord-lieutenant, the\r\narchbishop of Dublin, the privy-council, the lord-mayor, and a great\r\ncongregation, blood was seen to run through the crevices of the crown of\r\nthorns, and to trickle down the face of the image. On this, some of the\r\ncontrivers of the imposture cried aloud: \"See how our Saviour's image\r\nsweats blood! But it must necessarily do this, since heresy is come into\r\nthe church.\" Immediately many of the lower order of people, indeed the\r\n_vulgar of all ranks_, were terrified at the sight of so _miraculous_\r\nand _undeniable_ an evidence of the divine displeasure; they hastened\r\nfrom the church, convinced that the doctrines of protestantism emanated\r\nfrom an infernal source, and that salvation was only to be found in the\r\nbosom of their own _infallible_ church.\r\n\r\nThis incident, however ludicrous it may appear to the enlightened\r\nreader, had great influence over the minds of the ignorant Irish, and\r\nanswered the ends of the impudent imposters who contrived it, so far as\r\nto check the progress of the reformed religion in Ireland very\r\nmaterially; many persons could not resist the conviction that there were\r\nmany errors and corruptions in the Romish church, but they were awed\r\ninto silence by this pretended manifestation of Divine wrath, which was\r\nmagnified beyond measure by the bigoted and interested priesthood.\r\n\r\nWe have very few particulars as to the state of religion in Ireland\r\nduring the remaining portion of the reign of Edward VI. and the greater\r\npart of that of Mary. Towards the conclusion of the barbarous sway of\r\nthat relentless bigot, she attempted to extend her inhuman persecutions\r\nto this island; but her diabolical intentions were happily frustrated in\r\nthe following providential manner, the particulars of which are related\r\nby historians of good authority.\r\n\r\nMary had appointed Dr. Cole (an agent of the blood-thirsty Bonner) one\r\nof the commissioners for carrying her barbarous intentions into effect.\r\nHe having arrived at Chester with his commission, the mayor of that\r\ncity, being a papist, waited upon him; when the doctor taking out of his\r\ncloak-bag a leathern case, said to him, \"Here is a commission that shall\r\nlash the heretics of Ireland.\" The good woman of the house being a\r\nprotestant, and having a brother in Dublin, named John Edmunds, was\r\ngreatly troubled at what she heard. But watching her opportunity, whilst\r\nthe mayor was taking his leave, and the doctor politely accompanying him\r\ndown stairs, she opened the box, took out the commission, and in its\r\nstead laid a sheet of paper, with a pack of cards, and the _knave of\r\nclubs_ at top. The doctor, not suspecting the trick that had been played\r\nhim, put up the box, and arrived with it in Dublin, in September, 1558.\r\n\r\nAnxious to accomplish the intentions of his \"_pious_\" mistress, he\r\nimmediately waited upon Lord Fitz-Walter, at that time viceroy, and\r\npresented the box to him; which being opened, nothing was found in it\r\nbut a pack of cards. This startling all the persons present, his\r\nlordship said, \"We must procure another commission; and in the mean time\r\nlet us shuffle the cards!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Cole, however, would have directly returned to England to get\r\nanother commission; but waiting for a favourable wind, news arrived that\r\nqueen Mary was dead, and by this means the protestants escaped a most\r\ncruel persecution. The above relation as we before observed, is\r\nconfirmed by historians of the greatest credit, who add, that queen\r\nElizabeth settled a pension of forty pounds per annum upon the above\r\nmentioned Elizabeth Edmunds, for having thus saved the lives of her\r\nprotestant subjects.\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. Ireland was almost\r\nconstantly agitated by rebellions and insurrections, which, although not\r\nalways taking their rise from the difference of religious opinions\r\nbetween the English and Irish, were aggravated and rendered more bitter\r\nand irreconcilable from that cause. The popish priests artfully\r\nexaggerated the faults of the English government, and continually urged\r\nto their ignorant and prejudiced hearers the lawfulness of killing the\r\nprotestants, assuring them that all catholics who were slain in the\r\nprosecution of so _pious_ an enterprise, would be immediately received\r\ninto everlasting felicity. The naturally ungovernable dispositions of\r\nthe Irish, acted upon by these designing men, drove them into continual\r\nacts of barbarous and unjustifiable violence; and it must be confessed\r\nthat the unsettled and arbitrary nature of the authority exercised by\r\nthe English governors, was but little calculated to gain their\r\naffections. The Spaniards, too, by landing forces in the south, and\r\ngiving every encouragement to the discontented natives to join their\r\nstandard, kept the island in a continual state of turbulence and\r\nwarfare. In 1601, they disembarked a body of 4000 men at Kinsale, and\r\ncommenced what they called \"_the holy war for the preservation of the\r\nfaith in Ireland_;\" they were assisted by great numbers of the Irish,\r\nbut were at length totally defeated by the deputy, lord Mountjoy, and\r\nhis officers.\r\n\r\nThis closed the transactions of Elizabeth's reign with respect to\r\nIreland; an interval of apparent tranquility followed, but the popish\r\npriesthood, ever restless and designing, sought to undermine by secret\r\nmachinations, that government and that faith which they durst no longer\r\nopenly attack. The pacific reign of James afforded them the opportunity\r\nof increasing their strength and maturing their schemes, and under his\r\nsuccessor, Charles I. their numbers were greatly increased by titular\r\nRomish archbishops, bishops, deans, vicars-general, abbots, priests, and\r\nfriars; for which reason, in 1629, the public exercise of the popish\r\nrites and ceremonies was forbidden.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding this, soon afterwards, the Romish clergy erected a\r\nnew popish university in the city of Dublin. They also proceeded to\r\nbuild monasteries and nunneries in various parts of the kingdom; in\r\nwhich places these very Romish clergy, and the chiefs of the Irish, held\r\nfrequent meetings; and from thence, used to pass to and fro, to France,\r\nSpain, Flanders, Lorrain, and Rome; where the detestable plot of 1641\r\nwas hatching by the family of the O'Neals and their followers.\r\n\r\nA short time before the horrid conspiracy broke out, which we are now\r\ngoing to relate, the papists in Ireland had presented a remonstrance to\r\nthe lords-justices of that kingdom, demanding the free exercise of their\r\nreligion, and a repeal of all laws to the contrary, to which both houses\r\nof parliament in England, solemnly answered, that they would never grant\r\nany toleration to the popish religion in that kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis farther irritated the papists to put in execution the diabolical\r\nplot concerted for the destruction of the protestants; and it failed not\r\nof the success wished for by its malicious and rancorous projectors.\r\n\r\nThe design of this horrid conspiracy was, that a general insurrection\r\nshould take place at the same time throughout the kingdom, and that all\r\nthe protestants, without exception, should be murdered. The day fixed\r\nfor this horrid massacre, was the 23d of October, 1641, the feast of\r\nIgnatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits; and the chief conspirators, in\r\nthe principal parts of the kingdom, made the necessary preparations for\r\nthe intended conflict.\r\n\r\nIn order that this detested scheme might the more infallibly succeed,\r\nthe most distinguished artifices were practised by the papists; and\r\ntheir behaviour in their visits to the protestants, at this time, was\r\nwith more seeming kindness than they had hitherto shown, which was done\r\nthe more completely to effect the inhuman and treacherous designs then\r\nmeditating against them.\r\n\r\nThe execution of this savage conspiracy was delayed till the approach of\r\nwinter, that sending troops from England might be attended with greater\r\ndifficulty. Cardinal Richelieu, the French minister, had promised the\r\nconspirators a considerable supply of men and money; and many Irish\r\nofficers had given the strongest assurances that they would heartily\r\nconcur with their catholic brethren, as soon as the insurrection took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe day preceding that appointed for carrying this horrid design into\r\nexecution, was now arrived, when, happily for the metropolis of the\r\nkingdom, the conspiracy was discovered by one Owen O'Connelly, an\r\nIrishman, for which most signal service the English parliament voted him\r\n500_l._ and a pension of 200_l._ during his life.\r\n\r\nSo very seasonably was this plot discovered, even but a few hours before\r\nthe city and castle of Dublin were to have been surprised, that the\r\nlords-justices had but just time to put themselves, and the city, in a\r\nproper posture of defence. The lord M'Guire, who was the principal\r\nleader here, with his accomplices, were seized the same evening in the\r\ncity; and in their lodgings were found swords, hatchets, pole-axes,\r\nhammers, and such other instruments of death as had been prepared for\r\nthe destruction and extirpation of the protestants in that part of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThus was the metropolis happily preserved; but the bloody part of the\r\nintended tragedy was past prevention. The conspirators were in arms all\r\nover the kingdom early in the morning of the day appointed, and every\r\nprotestant who fell in their way was immediately murdered. No age, no\r\nsex, no condition, was spared. The wife weeping for her butchered\r\nhusband, and embracing her helpless children, was pierced with them, and\r\nperished by the same stroke. The old, the young, the vigorous, and the\r\ninfirm, underwent the same fate, and were blended in one common ruin. In\r\nvain did flight save from the first assault, destruction was every where\r\nlet loose, and met the hunted victims at every turn. In vain was\r\nrecourse had to relations, to companions, to friends; all connexions\r\nwere dissolved; and death was dealt by that hand from which protection\r\nwas implored and expected. Without provocation, without opposition, the\r\nastonished English, living in profound peace, and, as they thought, full\r\nsecurity, were massacred by their nearest neighbours, with whom they had\r\nlong maintained a continued intercourse of kindness and good offices.\r\nNay, even death was the slightest punishment inflicted by these\r\nmonsters in human form; all the tortures which wanton cruelty could\r\ninvent, all the lingering pains of body, the anguish of mind, the\r\nagonies of despair, could not satiate revenge excited without injury,\r\nand cruelly derived from no just cause whatever. Depraved nature, even\r\nperverted religion, though encouraged by the utmost license, cannot\r\nreach to a greater pitch of ferocity than appeared in these merciless\r\nbarbarians. Even the weaker sex themselves, naturally tender to their\r\nown sufferings, and compassionate to those of others, have emulated\r\ntheir robust companions in the practice of every cruelty. The very\r\nchildren, taught by example, and encouraged by the exhortation of their\r\nparents, dealt their feeble blows on the dead carcasses of the\r\ndefenceless children of the English.\r\n\r\nNor was the avarice of the Irish sufficient to produce the least\r\nrestraint on their cruelty. Such was their frenzy, that the cattle they\r\nhad seized, and by rapine had made their own, were, because they bore\r\nthe name of English, wantonly slaughtered, or, when covered with wounds,\r\nturned loose into the woods, there to perish by slow and lingering\r\ntorments.\r\n\r\nThe commodious habitations of the planters were laid in ashes, or\r\nlevelled with the ground. And where the wretched owners had shut\r\nthemselves up in the houses, and were preparing for defence, they\r\nperished in the flames together with their wives and children.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general description of this unparalleled massacre; but it\r\nnow remains, from the nature of our work, that we proceed to\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nThe bigoted and merciless papists had no sooner begun to imbrue their\r\nhands in blood, than they repeated the horrid tragedy day after day, and\r\nthe protestants in all parts of the kingdom fell victims to their fury\r\nby deaths of the most unheard of cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant Irish were more strongly instigated to execute the infernal\r\nbusiness by the jesuits, priests, and friars, who, when the day for the\r\nexecution of the plot was agreed on, recommended in their prayers,\r\ndiligence in the great design, which they said would greatly tend to the\r\nprosperity of the kingdom, and to the advancement of the Catholic cause.\r\nThey every where declared to the common people, that the protestants\r\nwere heretics, and ought not to be suffered to live any longer among\r\nthem; adding, that it was no more sin to kill an Englishman than to kill\r\na dog; and that the relieving or protecting them was a crime of the most\r\nunpardonable nature.\r\n\r\nThe papists having besieged the town and castle of Longford, and the\r\ninhabitants of the latter, who were protestants, surrendering on\r\ncondition of being allowed quarter, the besiegers, the instant the\r\ntowns-people appeared, attacked them in a most unmerciful manner, their\r\npriest, as a signal for the rest to fall on, first ripping open the\r\nbelly of the English protestant minister; after which his followers\r\nmurdered all the rest, some of whom they hung, others were stabbed or\r\nshot and great numbers knocked on the head with axes provided for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe garrison at Sligo was treated in like manner by O'Connor Slygah;\r\nwho, upon the protestants quitting their holds, promised them quarter,\r\nand to convey them safe over the Curlew mountains, to Roscommon. But he\r\nfirst imprisoned them in a most loathsome jail, allowing them only\r\ngrains for their food. Afterward, when some papists were merry over\r\ntheir cups, who were come to congratulate their wicked brethren for\r\ntheir victory over these unhappy creatures, those protestants who\r\nsurvived were brought forth by the White-friars, and were either killed,\r\nor precipitated over the bridge into a swift river, where they were soon\r\ndestroyed. It is added, that this wicked company of White-friars went,\r\nsome time after, in solemn procession, with holy water in their hands,\r\nto sprinkle the river; on pretence of cleansing and purifying it from\r\nthe stains and pollution of the blood and dead bodies of the heretics,\r\nas they called the unfortunate protestants who were inhumanly\r\nslaughtered at this very time.\r\n\r\nAt Kilmore, Dr. Bedell, bishop of that see, had charitably settled and\r\nsupported a great number of distressed protestants, who had fled from\r\ntheir habitations to escape the diabolical cruelties committed by the\r\npapists. But they did not long enjoy the consolation of living together;\r\nthe good prelate was forcibly dragged from his episcopal residence,\r\nwhich was immediately occupied by Dr. Swiney, the popish titular bishop\r\nof Kilmore, who said mass in the church the Sunday following, and then\r\nseized on all the goods and effects belonging to the persecuted bishop.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, the papists forced Dr. Bedell, his two sons, and the\r\nrest of his family, with some of the chief of the protestants whom he\r\nhad protected, into a ruinous castle, called Lochwater, situated in a\r\nlake near the sea. Here he remained with his companions some weeks, all\r\nof them daily expecting to be put to death. The greatest part of them\r\nwere stripped naked, by which means, as the season was cold, (it being\r\nin the month of December) and the building in which they were confined\r\nopen at the top, they suffered the most severe hardships. They continued\r\nin this situation till the 7th of January, when they were all released.\r\nThe bishop was courteously received into the house of Dennis O'Sheridan,\r\none of his clergy, whom he had made a convert to the church of England;\r\nbut he did not long survive this kindness. During his residence here, he\r\nspent the whole of his time in religious exercises, the better to fit\r\nand prepare himself and his sorrowful companions, for their great change\r\nas not but certain death was perpetually before their eyes. He was at\r\nthis time in the 71st year of his age, and being afflicted with a\r\nviolent ague caught in his late cold and desolate habitation on the\r\nlake, it soon threw him into a fever of the most dangerous nature.\r\nFinding his dissolution at hand, he received it with joy, like one of\r\nthe primitive martyrs just hastening to his crown of glory. After\r\nhaving addressed his little flock, and exhorted them to patience, in the\r\nmost pathetic manner, as they saw their own last day approaching, after\r\nhaving solemnly blessed his people, his family, and his children, he\r\nfinished the course of his ministry and life together, on the 7th day of\r\nFebruary, 1642. His friends and relations applied to the intruding\r\nbishop for leave to bury him, which was with difficulty obtained; he, at\r\nfirst telling them that the churchyard was holy ground, and should be no\r\nlonger defiled with heretics: however, leave was at last granted, and\r\nthough the church funeral service was not used at the solemnity, (for\r\nfear of the Irish papists) yet some of the better sort, who had the\r\nhighest veneration for him while living, attended his remains to the\r\ngrave. At his interment, they discharged a volley of shot, crying out,\r\n\"Requiescat in pace ultimas Anglorum;\" that is, May the last of the\r\nEnglish rest in peace. Adding, that as he was one of the best so he\r\nshould be the last English bishop found among them. His learning was\r\nvery extensive; and he would have given the world a greater proof of it,\r\nhad he printed all he wrote. Scarce any of his writings were saved; the\r\npapists having destroyed most of his papers and his library. He had\r\ngathered a vast heap of critical expositions of scripture, all which\r\nwith a great trunk full of his manuscripts, fell into the hands of the\r\nIrish. Happily his great Hebrew MS. was preserved, and is now in the\r\nlibrary of Emanuel college, Oxford.\r\n\r\nIn the barony of Terawley, the papists, at the instigation of the\r\nfriars, compelled above forty English protestants, some of whom were\r\nwomen and children, to the hard fate either of falling by the sword, or\r\nof drowning in the sea. These choosing the latter, were accordingly\r\nforced, by the naked weapons of their inexorable persecutors, into the\r\ndeep, where, with their children in their arms, they first waded up to\r\ntheir chins, and afterwards sunk down and perished together.\r\n\r\nIn the castle of Lisgool upwards of one hundred and fifty men, women,\r\nand children, were all burnt together; and at the castle of Moneah not\r\nless than one hundred were all put to the sword.--Great numbers were\r\nalso murdered at the castle of Tullah, which was delivered up to M'Guire\r\non condition of having fair quarter; but no sooner had that base villain\r\ngot possession of the place, than he ordered his followers to murder the\r\npeople, which was immediately done with the greatest cruelty.\r\n\r\nMany others were put to deaths of the most horrid nature, and such as\r\ncould have been invented only by demons instead of men. Some of them\r\nwere laid with the centre of their backs on the axle-tree of a carriage,\r\nwith their legs resting on the ground on one side, and then arms and\r\nhead on the other. In this position one of the savages scourged the\r\nwretched object on the thighs, legs, &c. while another set on furious\r\ndogs, who tore to pieces the arms and upper parts of the body; and in\r\nthis dreadful manner were they deprived of their existence. Great\r\nnumbers were fastened to horses' tails, and the beasts being set on\r\nfull gallop by their riders, the wretched victims were dragged along\r\ntill they expired. Others were hung on lofty gibbets, and a fire being\r\nkindled under them, they finished their lives, partly by hanging, and\r\npartly by suffocation.\r\n\r\nNor did the more tender sex escape the least particle of cruelty that\r\ncould be projected by their merciless and furious persecutors. Many\r\nwomen, of all ages, were put to deaths of the most cruel nature. Some,\r\nin particular, were fastened with their backs to strong posts, and being\r\nstripped to their waists, the inhuman monsters cut off their right\r\nbreasts with shears, which, of course, put them to the most excruciating\r\ntorments; and in this position they were left, till, from the loss of\r\nblood, they expired.\r\n\r\nSuch was the savage ferocity of these barbarians, that even unborn\r\ninfants were dragged from the womb to become victims to their rage. Many\r\nunhappy mothers were hung naked on the branches of trees, and their\r\nbodies being cut open, the innocent offsprings were taken from them, and\r\nthrown to dogs and swine. And to increase the horrid scene, they would\r\noblige the husband to be a spectator before suffered himself.\r\n\r\nAt the town of Issenskeath they hanged above a hundred Scottish\r\nprotestants, showing them no more mercy than they did to the English.\r\nM'Guire, going to the castle of that town, desired to speak with the\r\ngovernor, when being admitted, he immediately burnt the records of the\r\ncounty, which were kept there. He then demanded L1000 of the governor,\r\nwhich having received, he immediately compelled him to hear mass, and to\r\nswear that he would continue so to do. And to complete his horrid\r\nbarbarities, he ordered the wife and children of the governor to be hung\r\nbefore his face; besides massacring at least one hundred of the\r\ninhabitants. Upwards of one thousand men, women and children, were\r\ndriven, in different companies, to Porterdown bridge, which was broken\r\nin the middle, and there compelled to throw themselves into the water,\r\nand such as attempted to reach the shore were knocked on the head.\r\n\r\nIn the same part of the country, at least four thousand persons were\r\ndrowned in different places. The inhuman papists, after first stripping\r\nthem, drove them like beasts to the spot fixed on for their destruction;\r\nand if any, through fatigue, or natural infirmities, were slack in their\r\npace, they pricked them with their swords and pikes; and to strike\r\nterror on the multitude, they murdered some by the way.--Many of these\r\npoor wretches, when thrown into the water, endeavoured to save\r\nthemselves by swimming to the shore; but their merciless persecutors\r\nprevented their endeavors taking effect by shooting them in the water.\r\n\r\nIn one place one hundred and forty English, after being driven for many\r\nmiles stark naked, and in the most severe weather, were all murdered on\r\nthe same spot, some being hanged, others burnt, some shot, and many of\r\nthem buried alive; and so cruel were their tormentors, that they would\r\nnot suffer them to pray before they robbed them of their miserable\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nOther companies they took under pretence of safe conduct, who, from that\r\nconsideration, proceeded cheerfully on their journey; but when the\r\ntreacherous papists had got them to a convenient spot, they butchered\r\nthem all in the most cruel manner.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifteen men, women, and children, were conducted, by\r\norder of Sir Phelim O'Neal, to Porterdown bridge, where they were all\r\nforced into the river, and drowned. One woman, named Campbell, finding\r\nno probability of escaping, suddenly clasped one of the chief of the\r\npapists in her arms, and held him so fast, that they were both drowned\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn Killoman they massacred forty-eight families, among whom twenty-two\r\nwere burnt together in one house. The rest were either hanged, shot, or\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nIn Kilmore the inhabitants, which consisted of about two hundred\r\nfamilies, all fell victims to their rage. Some of them sat in the stocks\r\ntill they confessed where their money was; after which they put them to\r\ndeath. The whole county was one common scene of butchery, and many\r\nthousands perished, in a short time, by sword, famine, fire, water, and\r\nother the most cruel deaths, that rage and malice could invent.\r\n\r\nThese bloody villains showed so much favour to some as to despatch them\r\nimmediately; but they would by no means suffer them to pray. Others they\r\nimprisoned in filthy dungeons, putting heavy bolts on their legs, and\r\nkeeping them there till they were starved to death.\r\n\r\nAt Casel they put all the protestants into a loathsome dungeon, where\r\nthey kept them together, for several weeks, in the greatest misery. At\r\nlength they were released, when some of them were barbarously mangled,\r\nand left on the highways to perish at leisure; others were hanged, and\r\nsome were buried in the ground upright, with their heads above the\r\nearth, and the papists, to increase their misery, treating them with\r\nderision during their sufferings. In the county of Antrim they murdered\r\nnine hundred and fifty-four protestants in one morning; and afterward\r\nabout twelve hundred more in that county.\r\n\r\nAt a town called Lisnegary, they forced twenty-four protestants into a\r\nhouse, and then setting fire to it, burned them together, counterfeiting\r\ntheir outcries in derision to the others.\r\n\r\nAmong other acts of cruelty they took two children belonging to an\r\nEnglish woman, and dashed out their brains before her face; after which\r\nthey threw the mother into a river, and she was drowned. They served\r\nmany other children in the like manner, to the great affliction of their\r\nparents, and the disgrace of human nature.\r\n\r\nIn Kilkenny all the protestants, without exception, were put to death;\r\nand some of them in so cruel a manner, as, perhaps, was never before\r\nthought of.\r\n\r\nThey beat an English woman with such savage barbarity, that she had\r\nscarce a whole bone left; after which they threw her into a ditch; but\r\nnot satisfied with this, they took her child, a girl about six years of\r\nage and after ripping up its belly, threw it to its mother, there to\r\nlanguish till it perished. They forced one man to go to mass, after\r\nwhich they ripped open his body, and in that manner left him. They sawed\r\nanother asunder, cut the throat of his wife, and after having dashed out\r\nthe brains of their child, an infant, threw it to the swine, who\r\ngreedily devoured it.\r\n\r\nAfter committing these, and several other horrid cruelties, they took\r\nthe heads of seven protestants, and among them that of a pious minister,\r\nall which they fixed up at the market cross. They put a gag into the\r\nminister's mouth, then slit his cheeks to his ears, and laying a leaf of\r\na Bible before it, bid him preach, for his mouth was wide enough. They\r\ndid several other things by way of derision, and expressed the greatest\r\nsatisfaction at having thus murdered and exposed the unhappy\r\nprotestants.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive the pleasure these monsters took in\r\nexercising their cruelty, and to increase the misery of those who fell\r\ninto their hands, when they butchered them they would say, \"Your soul to\r\nthe devil.\" One of these miscreants would come into a house with his\r\nhands imbued in blood, and boast that it was English blood, and that his\r\nsword had pricked the white skins of the protestants, even to the hilt.\r\nWhen any one of them had killed a protestant, others would come and\r\nreceive a gratification in cutting and mangling the body; after which\r\nthey left it exposed to be devoured by dogs; and when they had slain a\r\nnumber of them they would boast, that the devil was beholden to them for\r\nsending so many souls to hell. But it is no wonder they should thus\r\ntreat the innocent christians, when they hesitated not to commit\r\nblasphemy against God and his most holy word.\r\n\r\nIn one place they burnt two protestant Bibles, and then said they had\r\nburnt hell-fire. In the church at Powerscourt they burnt the pulpit,\r\npews, chests, and Bibles belonging to it. They took other Bibles, and\r\nafter wetting them with dirty water, dashed them in the faces of the\r\nprotestants, saying, \"We know you love a good lesson; here is an\r\nexcellent one for you; come to-morrow, and you shall have as good a\r\nsermon as this.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the protestants they dragged by the hair of their heads into the\r\nchurch, where they stripped and whipped them in the most cruel manner,\r\ntelling them, at the same time, \"That if they came to-morrow, they\r\nshould hear the like sermon.\"\r\n\r\nIn Munster they put to death several ministers in the most shocking\r\nmanner. One, in particular, they stripped stark naked, and driving him\r\nbefore them, pricked him with swords and darts till he fell down, and\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nIn some places they plucked out the eyes, and cut off the hands of the\r\nprotestants, and in that manner turned them into the fields, there to\r\nwander out their miserable existence. They obliged many young men to\r\nforce their aged parents to a river, where they were drowned; wives to\r\nassist in hanging their husbands; and mothers to cut the throats of\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\nIn one place they compelled a young man to kill his father, and then\r\nimmediately hanged him. In another they forced a woman to kill her\r\nhusband, then obliged the son to kill her, and afterward shot him\r\nthrough the head.\r\n\r\nAt a place called Glaslow, a popish priest, with some others, prevailed\r\non forty protestants to be reconciled to the church of Rome. They had no\r\nsooner done this, than they told them they were in good faith, and that\r\nthey would prevent their falling from it, and turning heretics, by\r\nsending them out of the world, which they did by immediately cutting\r\ntheir throats.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Tipperary upwards of thirty protestants, men, women,\r\nand children, fell into the hands of the papists, who, after stripping\r\nthem naked, murdered them with stones, pole-axes, swords, and other\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Mayo about sixty protestants, fifteen of whom were\r\nministers, were, upon covenant, to be safely conducted to Galway, by one\r\nEdmund Burke and his soldiers; but that inhuman monster by the way drew\r\nhis sword, as an intimation of his design to the rest, who immediately\r\nfollowed his example, and murdered the whole, some of whom they stabbed,\r\nothers were run through the body with pikes, and several were drowned.\r\n\r\nIn Queen's county great numbers of protestants were put to the most\r\nshocking deaths. Fifty or sixty were placed together in one house, which\r\nbeing set on fire, they all perished in the flames. Many were stripped\r\nnaked, and being fastened to horses by ropes placed round their middles,\r\nwere dragged through bogs till they expired. Some were hung by the feet\r\nto tenter-hooks driven into poles; and in that wretched posture left\r\ntill they perished. Others were fastened to the trunk of a tree, with a\r\nbranch at top. Over this branch hung one arm, which principally\r\nsupported the weight of the body; and one of the legs was turned up, and\r\nfastened to the trunk, while the other hung straight. In this dreadful\r\nand uneasy posture did they remain, as long as life would permit,\r\npleasing spectacles to their blood-thirsty persecutors.\r\n\r\nAt Clownes seventeen men were buried alive; and an Englishman, his wife,\r\nfive children, and a servant maid, were all hung together and afterward\r\nthrown into a ditch. They hung many by the arms to branches of trees,\r\nwith a weight to their feet; and others by the middle, in which postures\r\nthey left them till they expired. Several were hung on windmills, and\r\nbefore they were half dead, the barbarians cut them in pieces with their\r\nswords. Others, both men, women, and children, they cut and hacked in\r\nvarious parts of their bodies, and left them wallowing in their blood to\r\nperish where they fell. One poor woman they hung on a gibbet, with her\r\nchild, an infant about a twelve-month old, the latter of whom was hung\r\nby the neck with the hair of its mother's head, and in that manner\r\nfinished its short but miserable existence.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Tyrone no less than three hundred protestants were\r\ndrowned in one day; and many others were hanged, burned, and otherwise\r\nput to death. Dr. Maxwell, rector of Tyrone, lived at this time near\r\nArmagh, and suffered greatly from these merciless savages. This person,\r\nin his examination, taken upon oath before the king's commissioners,\r\ndeclared, that the Irish papists owned to him, that they, at several\r\ntimes, had destroyed, in one place, 12,000 protestants, whom they\r\ninhumanly slaughtered at Glynwood, in their flight from the county of\r\nArmagh.\r\n\r\nAs the river Bann was not fordable, and the bridge broken down, the\r\nIrish forced thither at different times, a great number of unarmed,\r\ndefenceless protestants, and with pikes and swords violently thrust\r\nabove one thousand into the river, where they miserably perished.\r\n\r\nNor did the cathedral of Armagh escape the fury of these barbarians, it\r\nbeing maliciously set on fire by their leaders, and burnt to the ground.\r\nAnd to extirpate, if possible, the very race of those unhappy\r\nprotestants, who lived in or near Armagh, the Irish first burnt all\r\ntheir houses, and then gathered together many hundreds of those innocent\r\npeople, young and old, on pretence of allowing them a guard and safe\r\nconduct to Colerain; when they treacherously fell on them by the way,\r\nand inhumanly murdered them.\r\n\r\nThe like horrid barbarities with those we have particularized, were\r\npractised on the wretched protestants in almost all parts of the\r\nkingdom; and, when an estimate was afterward made of the number who were\r\nsacrificed to gratify the diabolical souls of the papists, it amounted\r\nto one hundred and fifty thousand. But it now remains that we proceed to\r\nthe particulars that followed.\r\n\r\nThese desperate wretches, flushed and grown insolent with success,\r\n(though by methods attended with such excessive barbarities as perhaps\r\nnot to be equalled) soon got possession of the castle of Newry, where\r\nthe king's stores and ammunition were lodged; and, with as little\r\ndifficulty, made themselves masters of Dundalk. They afterward took the\r\ntown of Ardee, where they murdered all the protestants, and then\r\nproceeded to Drogheda. The garrison of Drogheda was in no condition to\r\nsustain a siege, notwithstanding which, as often as the Irish renewed\r\ntheir attacks they were vigorously repulsed by a very unequal number of\r\nthe king's forces, and a few faithful protestant citizens under sir\r\nHenry Tichborne, the governor, assisted by the lord viscount Moore. The\r\nsiege of Drogheda began on the 30th of November, 1641, and held till the\r\n4th of March, 1642, when sir Phelim O'Neal, and the Irish miscreants\r\nunder him were forced to retire.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time ten thousand troops were sent from Scotland to the\r\nremaining protestants in Ireland, which being properly divided in the\r\nmost capital parts of the kingdom, happily eclipsed the power of the\r\nIrish savages; and the protestants for a time lived in tranquility.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of king James II. they were again interrupted, for in a\r\nparliament held at Dublin in the year 1689, great numbers of the\r\nprotestant nobility, clergy, and gentry of Ireland, were attainted of\r\nhigh treason. The government of the kingdom was, at that time, invested\r\nin the earl of Tyrconnel, a bigoted papist, and an inveterate enemy to\r\nthe protestants. By his orders they were again persecuted in various\r\nparts of the kingdom. The revenues of the city of Dublin were seized,\r\nand most of the churches converted into prisons. And had it not been for\r\nthe resolution and uncommon bravery of the garrisons in the city of\r\nLondonderry, and the town of Inniskillin, there had not one place\r\nremained for refuge to the distressed protestants in the whole kingdom;\r\nbut all must have been given up to king James, and to the furious popish\r\nparty that governed him.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable siege of Londonderry was opened on the 18th of April,\r\n1689, by twenty thousand papists, the flower of the Irish army. The city\r\nwas not properly circumstanced to sustain a siege, the defenders\r\nconsisting of a body of raw undisciplined protestants, who had fled\r\nthither for shelter, and half a regiment of lord Mountjoy's disciplined\r\nsoldiers, with the principal part of the inhabitants, making in all only\r\nseven thousand three hundred and sixty-one fighting men.\r\n\r\nThe besieged hoped, at first, that their stores of corn, and other\r\nnecessaries, would be sufficient; but by the continuance of the siege\r\ntheir wants increased; and these became at last so heavy, that for a\r\nconsiderable time before the siege was raised, a pint of coarse barley,\r\na small quantity of greens, a few spoonfuls of starch, with a very\r\nmoderate proportion of horse flesh, were reckoned a week's provision for\r\na soldier. And they were, at length, reduced to such extremities, that\r\nthey ate dogs, cats, and mice.\r\n\r\nTheir miseries increasing with the siege, many, through mere hunger and\r\nwant, pined and languished away, or fell dead in the streets. And it is\r\nremarkable, that when their long expected succours arrived from England,\r\nthey were upon the point of being reduced to this alternative, either to\r\npreserve their existence by eating each other, or attempting to fight\r\ntheir way through the Irish, which must have infallibly produced their\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThese succours were most happily brought by the ship Mountjoy of Derry,\r\nand the Phoenix of Colerain, at which time they had only nine lean\r\nhorses left with a pint of meal to each man. By hunger, and the fatigues\r\nof war, their seven thousand three hundred and sixty-one fighting men,\r\nwere reduced to four thousand three hundred, one-fourth part of whom\r\nwere rendered unserviceable.\r\n\r\nAs the calamities of the besieged were great, so likewise were the\r\nterrors and sufferings of their protestant friends and relations; all of\r\nwhom (even women and children) were forcibly driven from the country\r\nthirty miles round, and inhumanly reduced to the sad necessity of\r\ncontinuing some days and nights without food or covering, before the\r\nwalls of the town; and were thus exposed to the continual fire both of\r\nthe Irish army from without, and the shot of their friends from within.\r\n\r\nBut the succours from England happily arriving put an end to their\r\naffliction; and the siege was raised on the 31st of July, having been\r\ncontinued upwards of three months.\r\n\r\nThe day before the siege of Londonderry was raised, the Inniskillers\r\nengaged a body of six thousand Irish Roman catholics, at Newton, Butler,\r\nor Crown-Castle, of whom near five thousand were slain. This, with the\r\ndefeat at Londonderry, dispirited the papists, and they gave up all\r\nfarther attempts to persecute the protestants.\r\n\r\nThe year following, viz. 1690; the Irish took up arms in favour of the\r\nabdicated prince, king James II. but they were totally defeated by his\r\nsuccessor king William the Third. That monarch, before he left the\r\ncountry, reduced them to a state of subjection, in which they have ever\r\nsince continued; and it is to be hoped will so remain as long as time\r\nshall be.\r\n\r\nBy a report made in Ireland, in the year 1731, it appeared that a great\r\nnumber of ecclesiastics had, in defiance of the laws, flocked into that\r\nkingdom: that several convents had been opened by jesuits, monks, and\r\nfriars; that many new and pompous mass-houses had been erected in some\r\nof the most conspicuous parts of their great cities, where there had not\r\nbeen any before; and that such swarms of vagrant, immoral Romish priests\r\nhad appeared, that the very papists themselves considered them as a\r\nburthen.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all this, the protestant interest at present stands\r\nupon a much stronger basis than it did a century ago. The Irish, who\r\nformerly led an unsettled and roving life, in the woods, bogs, and\r\nmountains, and lived on the depredation of their neighbours, they who,\r\nin the morning seized the prey, and at night divided the spoil, have,\r\nfor many years past, become quiet and civilized. They taste the sweets\r\nof English society, and the advantages of civil government. They trade\r\nin our cities, and are employed in our manufactories. They are received\r\nalso into English families; and treated with great humanity by the\r\nprotestants.\r\n\r\nThe heads of their clans, and the chiefs of the great Irish families,\r\nwho cruelly oppressed and tyrannized over their vassals, are now\r\ndwindled in a great measure to nothing; and most of the ancient popish\r\nnobility and gentry of Ireland have renounced the Romish religion.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be hoped, that inestimable benefits will arise from the\r\nestablishment of protestant schools in various parts of the kingdom, in\r\nwhich the children of the Roman catholics are instructed in religion and\r\nreading, whereby the mist of ignorance is dispelled from their eyes,\r\nwhich was the great source of the cruel transactions that have taken\r\nplace, at different periods, in that kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the protestant interest in Ireland upon a solid\r\nbasis, it behooves all in whom that power is invested, to discharge it\r\nwith the strictest assiduity and attention; for should it once again\r\nlose ground, there is no doubt but the papists would take those\r\nadvantages they have hitherto done, and thousands might yet fall victims\r\nto their malicious bigotry.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] Although Garnet was convicted for this horrible crime, yet the\r\nbigoted papists were so besotted as to look upon him as an object of\r\ndevotion; they fancied that miracles were wrought by his blood; and\r\nregarded him as a martyr! Such is the deadening and perverting influence\r\nof popery.\r\n\r\n[D] The king of England was at that time called _highness_, not\r\n_majesty_, as at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE RISE, PROGRESS, PERSECUTIONS, AND SUFFERINGS OF THE QUAKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn treating of these people in a historical manner, we are obliged to\r\nhave recourse to much tenderness. That they differ from the generality\r\nof protestants in some of the capital points of religion cannot be\r\ndenied, and yet, as protestant dissenters, they are included under the\r\ndescription of the toleration act. It is not our business to inquire\r\nwhether people of similar sentiments had any existence in the primitive\r\nages of Christianity: perhaps, in some respects, they had not, but we\r\nare to write of them not as what they were, but what they now are. That\r\nthey have been treated by several writers in a very contemptuous manner,\r\nis certain; that they did not deserve such treatment, is equally\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nThe appellation _Quakers_, was bestowed upon them as a term of reproach,\r\nin consequence of their apparent convulsions which they laboured under\r\nwhen they delivered their discourses, because they imagined they were\r\nthe effect of divine inspiration.\r\n\r\nIt is not our business, at present, to inquire whether the sentiments of\r\nthese people are agreeable to the gospel, but this much is certain, that\r\nthe first leader of them, as a separate body, was a man of obscure\r\nbirth, who had his first existence in Leicestershire, about the year\r\n1624. In speaking of this man we shall deliver our own sentiments in a\r\nhistorical manner, and joining these to what have been said by the\r\nFriends themselves, we shall endeavour to furnish out a complete\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nHe was descended of honest and respected parents, who brought him up in\r\nthe national religion: but from a child he appeared religious, still,\r\nsolid, and observing, beyond his years, and uncommonly knowing in divine\r\nthings. He was brought up to husbandry, and other country business, and\r\nwas particularly inclined to the solitary occupation of a shepherd; \"an\r\nemployment,\" says our author, \"that very well suited his mind in several\r\nrespects, both for its innocency and solitude; and was a just emblem of\r\nhis after ministry and service.\" In the year 1646, he entirely forsook\r\nthe national church, in whose tenets he had been brought up, as before\r\nobserved; and in 1647, he travelled into Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire,\r\nwithout any set purpose of visiting particular places, but in a solitary\r\nmanner he walked through several towns and villages, which way soever\r\nhis mind turned. \"He fasted much,\" said Sewell, \"and walked often in\r\nretired places, with no other companion than his Bible.\" \"He visited the\r\nmost retired and religious people in those parts,\" says Penn, \"and some\r\nthere were, short of few, if any, in this nation, who waited for the\r\nconsolation of Israel night and day; as Zacharias, Anna, and Simeon,\r\ndid of old time.\" To these he was sent, and these he sought out in the\r\nneighbouring counties, and among them he sojourned till his more ample\r\nministry came upon him. At this time he taught, and was an example of\r\nsilence, endeavouring to bring them from self-performances; testifying\r\nof, and turning them to the light of Christ within them, and encouraging\r\nthem to wait in patience, and to feel the power of it to stir in their\r\nhearts, that their knowledge and worship of God might stand in the power\r\nof an endless life which was to be found in the light, as it was obeyed\r\nin the manifestation of it in man: for in the word was life, and that\r\nlife is the light of men. Life in the word, light in men; and life in\r\nmen too, as the light is obeyed; the children of the light living by the\r\nlife of the word, by which the word begets them again to God, which is\r\nthe generation and new birth, without which there is no coming into the\r\nkingdom of God, and to which whoever comes is greater than John: that\r\nis, than John's dispensation, which was not that of the kingdom, but the\r\nconsummation of the legal, and forerunning of the gospel times, the time\r\nof the kingdom. Accordingly several meetings were gathering in those\r\nparts; and thus his time was employed for some years.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1652, \"he had a visitation of the great work of God in the\r\nearth, and of the way that he was to go forth, in a public ministry, to\r\nbegin it.\" He directed his course northward, \"and in every place where\r\nhe came, if not before he came to it, he had his particular exercise and\r\nservice shown to him, so that the Lord was his leader indeed.\" He made\r\ngreat numbers of converts to his opinions, and many pious and good men\r\njoined him in his ministry. These were drawn forth especially to visit\r\nthe public assemblies to reprove, reform, and exhort them; sometimes in\r\nmarkets, fairs, streets, and by the highway-side, \"calling people to\r\nrepentance, and to return to the Lord, with their hearts as well as\r\ntheir mouths; directing them to the light of Christ within them, to see,\r\nexamine, and to consider their ways by, and to eschew the evil, and to\r\ndo the good and acceptable will of God.\"\r\n\r\nThey were not without opposition in the work they imagined themselves\r\ncalled to, being often set in the stocks, stoned, beaten, whipped and\r\nimprisoned, though, as our author observes, honest men of good report,\r\nthat had left wives, children, houses, and lands, to visit them with a\r\nliving call to repentance. But these coercive methods rather forwarded\r\nthan abated their zeal, and in those parts they brought over many\r\nproselytes, and amongst them several magistrates, and others of the\r\nbetter sort. They apprehended the Lord had forbidden them to pull off\r\ntheir hats to any one, high or low, and required them to speak to the\r\npeople, without distinction, in the language of thou and thee. They\r\nscrupled bidding people good-morrow, or good-night, nor might they bend\r\nthe knee to any one, even in supreme authority. Both men and woman went\r\nin a plain and simple dress, different from the fashion of the times.\r\nThey neither gave nor accepted any titles of respect or honour, nor\r\nwould they call any man master on earth. Several texts of scripture they\r\nquoted in defence of these singularities; such as, Swear not at all. How\r\ncan ye believe who receive honour one of another, and seek not the\r\nhonour which comes from God only? &c. &c. They placed the basis of\r\nreligion in an inward light, and an extraordinary impulse of the Holy\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\nIn 1654, their first separate meeting in London was held in the house of\r\nRobert Dring, in Watling-street, for by that time they spread themselves\r\ninto all parts of the kingdom, and had in many places set up meetings or\r\nassemblies, particularly in Lancashire, and the adjacent parts, but they\r\nwere still exposed to great persecutions and trials of every kind. One\r\nof them in a letter to the protector, Oliver Cromwell, represents,\r\nthough there are no penal laws in force obliging men to comply with the\r\nestablished religion, yet the Quakers are exposed upon other accounts;\r\nthey are fined and imprisoned for refusing to take an oath; for not\r\npaying their tithes; for disturbing the public assemblies, and meeting\r\nin the streets, and places of public resort; some of them have been\r\nwhipped for vagabonds, and for their plain speeches to the magistrate.\r\n\r\nUnder favour of the then toleration, they opened their meetings at the\r\nBull and Mouth, in Aldersgate-street, where women, as well as men, were\r\nmoved to speak. Their zeal transported them to some extravagancies,\r\nwhich laid them still more open to the lash of their enemies, who\r\nexercised various severities upon them throughout the next reign. Upon\r\nthe suppression of Venner's mad insurrection, the government, having\r\npublished a proclamation, forbidding the Anabaptists, Quakers, and Fifth\r\nMonarchy Men, to assemble or meet together under pretence of worshipping\r\nGod, except it be in some parochial church, chapel, or in private\r\nhouses, by consent of the persons there inhabiting, all meetings in\r\nother places being declared to be unlawful and riotous, &c. &c. the\r\nQuakers thought it expedient to address the king thereon, which they did\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\n        \"_O king Charles!_\r\n\r\n\"Our desire is, that thou mayest live for ever in the fear of God, and\r\nthy council. We beseech thee and thy council, to read these following\r\nlines in tender bowels, and compassion for our souls, and for your good.\r\n\r\n\"And this consider, we are about four hundred imprisoned, in and about\r\nthis city, of men and women from their families, besides, in the county\r\njails, about ten hundred; we desire that our meetings may not be broken\r\nup, but that all may come to a fair trial, that our innocency may be\r\ncleared up.\r\n\r\n        \"London, 16th day, eleventh month, 1660.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of the same month, they published the declaration referred\r\nto in their address, entitled, \"A declaration from the harmless and\r\ninnocent people of God, called Quakers, against all sedition, plotters,\r\nand fighters in the world, for removing the ground of jealousy and\r\nsuspicion, from both magistrates and people in the kingdom, concerning\r\nwars and fightings.\" It was presented to the king the 21st day of the\r\neleventh month, 1660, and he promised them upon his royal word, that\r\nthey should not suffer for their opinions, as long as they lived\r\npeaceably; but his promises were very little regarded afterward.\r\n\r\nIn 1661, they assumed courage to petition the house of Lords for a\r\ntoleration of their religion, and for a dispensation from taking the\r\noaths, which they held unlawful, not from any disaffection to the\r\ngovernment, or a belief that they were less obliged by an affirmation,\r\nbut from a persuasion that all oaths were unlawful; and that swearing\r\nupon the most solemn occasions was forbidden in the New Testament. Their\r\npetition was rejected, and instead of granting them relief, an act was\r\npassed against them, the preamble to which set forth, \"That whereas\r\nseveral persons have taken up an opinion that an oath, even before a\r\nmagistrate, is unlawful, and contrary to the word of God: and whereas,\r\nunder pretence of religious worship, the said persons do assemble in\r\ngreat numbers in several parts of the kingdom, separating themselves\r\nfrom the rest of his majesty's subjects, and the public congregations\r\nand usual places of divine worship; be it therefore enacted, that if any\r\nsuch persons, after the 24th of March, 1661-2, shall refuse to take an\r\noath when lawfully tendered, or persuade others to do it, or maintain in\r\nwriting or otherwise, the unlawfulness of taking an oath; or if they\r\nshall assemble for religious worship, to the number of five or more, of\r\nthe age of fifteen, they shall for the first offence forfeit five\r\npounds; for the second, ten pounds; and for the third shall abjure the\r\nrealm, or be transported to the plantations: and the justices of peace\r\nat their open sessions may hear and finally determine in the affair.\"\r\n\r\nThis act had a most dreadful effect upon the Quakers, though it was well\r\nknown and notorious that these conscientious persons were far from\r\nsedition or disaffection to the government. George Fox, in his address\r\nto the king, acquaints him, that three thousand and sixty-eight of their\r\nfriends had been imprisoned since his majesty's restoration; that their\r\nmeetings were daily broken up by men with clubs and arms, and their\r\nfriends thrown into the water, and trampled under foot till the blood\r\ngushed out, which gave rise to their meeting in the open streets. A\r\nrelation was printed, signed by twelve witnesses, which says, that more\r\nthan four thousand two hundred Quakers were imprisoned; and of them five\r\nhundred were in and about London, and the suburbs; several of whom were\r\ndead in the jails.\r\n\r\nHowever, they even gloried in their sufferings, which increased every\r\nday; so that in 1665, and the intermediate years, they were harassed\r\nwithout example. As they persisted resolutely to assemble, openly, at\r\nthe Bull and Mouth, before mentioned, the soldiers, and other officers,\r\ndragged them from thence to prison, till Newgate was filled with them,\r\nand multitudes died of close confinement, in that and other jails.\r\n\r\nSix hundred of them, says an account published at this time, were in\r\nprison, merely for religion's sake, of whom several were banished to the\r\nplantations. In short, says Mr. Neale, the Quakers gave such full\r\nemployment to the informers, that they had less leisure to attend the\r\nmeetings of other dissenters.\r\n\r\nYet, under all these calamities, they behaved with patience and modesty\r\ntowards the government, and upon occasion of the Rye-house plot in 1682,\r\nthought proper to declare their innocence of that sham plot, in an\r\naddress to the king, wherein, appealing to the Searcher of all hearts,\r\nthey say, their principles do not allow them to take up defensive arms,\r\nmuch less to avenge themselves for the injuries they received from\r\nothers: that they continually pray for the king's safety and\r\npreservation; and therefore take this occasion humbly to beseech his\r\nmajesty to compassionate their suffering friends, with whom the jails\r\nare so filled, that they want air, to the apparent hazard of their\r\nlives, and to the endangering an infection in divers places. Besides,\r\nmany houses, shops, barns, and fields are ransacked, and the goods,\r\ncorn, and cattle swept away, to the discouraging trade and husbandry,\r\nand impoverishing great numbers of quiet and industrious people; and\r\nthis, for no other cause, but for the exercise of a tender conscience in\r\nthe worship of Almighty God, who is sovereign Lord and King of men's\r\nconsciences.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James II. they addressed that monarch honestly and\r\nplainly, telling him, \"We are come to testify our sorrow for the death\r\nof our good friend Charles, and our joy for thy being made our governor.\r\nWe are told thou art not of the persuasion of the church of England, no\r\nmore than we; therefore we hope thou wilt grant us the same liberty\r\nwhich thou allowest thyself, which doing, we wish thee all manner of\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\nWhen James, by his dispensing power, granted liberty to the dissenters,\r\nthey began to enjoy some rest from their troubles; and indeed it was\r\nhigh time, for they were swelled to an enormous amount. They, the year\r\nbefore this, to them one of glad release, in a petition to James for a\r\ncessation of their sufferings, set forth, \"that of late above one\r\nthousand five hundred of their friends, both men and women, and that now\r\nthere remain one thousand three hundred and eighty-three; of which two\r\nhundred are women, many under sentence of praemunire; and more than three\r\nhundred near it, for refusing the oath of allegiance, because they could\r\nnot swear. Three hundred and fifty have died in prison since the year\r\n1680; in London, the jail of Newgate has been crowded, within these two\r\nyears sometimes with near 20 in a room, whereby several have been\r\nsuffocated, and others, who have been taken out sick, have died of\r\nmalignant fevers within a few days. Great violences, outrageous\r\ndistresses, and woful havock and spoil, have been made upon people's\r\ngoods and estates, by a company of idle, extravagant, and merciless\r\ninformers, by persecutions on the conventicle-act, and others, also on\r\n_qui tam_ writs, and on other processes, for twenty pounds a month, and\r\ntwo-thirds of their estates seized for the king. Some had not a bed to\r\nrest on, others had no cattle to till the ground, nor corn for feed or\r\nbread, nor tools to work with, the said informers and bailiffs in some\r\nplaces breaking into houses, and making great waste and spoil, under\r\npretence of serving the king and the church. Our religious assemblies\r\nhave been charged at common law with being rioters and disturbers of the\r\npublic peace, whereby great numbers have been confined in prison without\r\nregard to age, and many confined in holes and dungeons. The seizing for\r\nL20 a month has amounted to many thousands, and several who have\r\nemployed some hundreds of poor people in manufactures, are disabled to\r\ndo so any more, by reason of long imprisonment. They spare neither widow\r\nnor fatherless, nor have they so much as a bed to lie on. The informers\r\nare both witnesses and prosecutors, to the ruin of great numbers of\r\nsober families; and justices of the peace have been threatened with the\r\nforfeiture of one hundred pounds, if they do not issue out warrants upon\r\ntheir informations.\" With this petition they presented a list of their\r\nfriends in prison, in the several counties, amounting to four hundred\r\nand sixty.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of king James II. these people were, through the\r\nintercession of their friend Mr. Penn, treated with greater indulgence\r\nthan ever they had been before. They were now become extremely numerous\r\nin many parts of the country, and the settlement of Pennsylvania taking\r\nplace soon after, many of them went over to America. There they enjoyed\r\nthe blessings of a peaceful government, and cultivated the arts of\r\nhonest industry.\r\n\r\nAs the whole colony was the property of Mr. Penn, so he invited people\r\nof all denominations to come and settle with him. A universal liberty of\r\nconscience took place; and in this new colony the natural rights of\r\nmankind were, for the first time, established.\r\n\r\nThese Friends are, in the present age, a very harmless, inoffensive body\r\nof people; but of that we shall take more notice hereafter. By their\r\nwise regulations, they not only do honour to themselves, but they are of\r\nvast service to the community.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary here to observe, that as the Friends, commonly\r\ncalled Quakers, will not take an oath in a court of justice, so their\r\naffirmation is permitted in all civil affairs; but they cannot prosecute\r\na criminal, because, in the English courts of justice, all evidence must\r\nbe upon oath.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An account of the persecution of Friends, commonly called Quakers in\r\nthe United States._\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the seventeenth century, much persecution and\r\nsuffering were inflicted on a sect of protestant dissenters, commonly\r\ncalled Quakers: a people which arose at that time in England some of\r\nwhom sealed their testimony with their blood.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the above people, see Sewell's, or Gough's history of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe principal points upon which their conscientious nonconformity\r\nrendered them obnoxious to the penalties of the law, were,\r\n\r\n1. The Christian resolution of assembling publicly for the worship of\r\nGod, in a manner most agreeable to their consciences.\r\n\r\n2. Their refusal to pay tithes, which they esteemed a Jewish ceremony,\r\nabrogated by the coming of Christ.\r\n\r\n3. Their testimony against wars and fighting, the practice of which they\r\njudged inconsistent with the command of Christ: \"Love your enemies,\" &c.\r\nMatt. v. 44.\r\n\r\n4. Their constant obedience to the command of Christ: \"Swear not at\r\nall,\" &c. Matt. v. 34.\r\n\r\n5. Their refusal to pay rates or assessments for building and repairing\r\nhouses for a worship which they did not approve.\r\n\r\n6. Their use of the proper and Scriptural language, \"thou,\" and \"thee,\"\r\nto a single person: and their disuse of the custom of uncovering their\r\nheads, or pulling off their hats, by way of homage to man.\r\n\r\n7. The necessity many found themselves under, of publishing what they\r\nbelieved to be the doctrine of truth; and sometimes even in the places\r\nappointed for the public national worship.\r\n\r\nTheir conscientious noncompliance in the preceding particulars, exposed\r\nthem to much persecution and suffering, which consisted in prosecutions,\r\nfines, cruel beatings, whippings, and other corporeal punishments;\r\nimprisonment, banishment, and even death.\r\n\r\nTo relate a particular account of their persecutions and sufferings,\r\nwould extend beyond the limits of this work: we shall therefore refer,\r\nfor that information, to the histories already mentioned, and more\r\nparticularly to Besse's Collection of their sufferings; and shall\r\nconfine our account here, mostly to those who sacrificed their lives,\r\nand evinced, by their disposition of mind, constancy, patience, and\r\nfaithful perseverance, that they were influenced by a sense of religious\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nNumerous and repeated were the persecutions against them; and sometimes\r\nfor transgressions or offences which the law did not contemplate or\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\nMany of the fines and penalties exacted of them, were not only\r\nunreasonable and exorbitant, but as they could not consistently pay\r\nthem, were sometimes distrained to several times the value of the\r\ndemand; whereby many poor families were greatly distressed, and obliged\r\nto depend on the assistance of their friends.\r\n\r\nNumbers were not only cruelly beaten and whipped in a public manner,\r\nlike criminals, but some were branded and others had their ears cut off.\r\n\r\nGreat numbers were long confined in loathsome prisons; in which some\r\nended their days in consequence thereof.\r\n\r\nMany were sentenced to banishment; and a considerable number were\r\ntransported. Some were banished on pain of death; and four were actually\r\nexecuted by the hands of the hangman, as we shall here relate, after\r\ninserting copies of some of the laws of the country where they suffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"At a General Court held at Boston, the 14th of October, 1656._\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, there is a cursed sect of heretics, lately risen up in the\r\nworld, which are commonly called Quakers, who take upon them to be\r\nimmediately sent from God, and infallibly assisted by the Spirit, to\r\nspeak and write blasphemous opinions, despising government, and the\r\norder of God, in the church and commonwealth, speaking evil of\r\ndignities, reproaching and reviling magistrates and ministers, seeking\r\nto turn the people from the faith, and gain proselytes to their\r\npernicious ways: this court taking into consideration the premises, and\r\nto prevent the like mischief, as by their means is wrought in our land,\r\ndoth hereby order, and by authority of this court, be it ordered and\r\nenacted, that what master or commander of any ship, bark, pink, or\r\nketch, shall henceforth bring into any harbour, creek, or cove, within\r\nthis jurisdiction, any Quaker or Quakers, or other blasphemous heretics,\r\nshall pay, or cause to be paid, the fine of one hundred pounds to the\r\ntreasurer of the country, except it appear he want true knowledge or\r\ninformation of their being such; and, in that case, he hath liberty to\r\nclear himself by his oath, when sufficient proof to the contrary is\r\nwanting: and, for default of good payment, or good security for it,\r\nshall be cast into prison, and there to continue till the said sum be\r\nsatisfied to the treasurer as aforesaid. And the commander of any ketch,\r\nship, or vessel, being legally convicted, shall give in sufficient\r\nsecurity to the governor, or any one or more of the magistrates, who\r\nhave power to determine the same, to carry them back to the place whence\r\nhe brought them; and, on his refusal so to do, the governor or one or\r\nmore of the magistrates, are hereby empowered to issue out his or their\r\nwarrants to commit such master or commander to prison, there to\r\ncontinue, till he give in sufficient security to the content of the\r\ngovernor, or any of the magistrates, as aforesaid. And it is hereby\r\nfurther ordered and enacted, that what Quaker soever shall arrive in\r\nthis country from foreign parts, or shall come into this jurisdiction\r\nfrom any parts adjacent, shall be forthwith committed to the house of\r\ncorrection; and, at their entrance, to be severely whipped, and by the\r\nmaster thereof be kept constantly to work, and none suffered to converse\r\nor speak with them, during the time of their imprisonment, which shall\r\nbe no longer than necessity requires. And it is ordered, if any person\r\nshall knowingly import into any harbour of this jurisdiction, any\r\nQuakers' books or writings, concerning their devilish opinions, shall\r\npay for such book or writing, being legally proved against him or them\r\nthe sum of five pounds; and whosoever shall disperse or conceal any such\r\nbook or writing, and it be found with him or her, or in his or her house\r\nand shall not immediately deliver the same to the next magistrate;\r\nshall forfeit or pay five pounds, for the dispersing or concealing of\r\nany such book or writing. And it is hereby further enacted, that if any\r\nperson within this colony, shall take upon them to defend the heretical\r\nopinions of the Quakers, or any of their books or papers, shall be fined\r\nfor the first time forty shillings; if they shall persist in the same,\r\nand shall again defend it the second time, four pounds; if\r\nnotwithstanding they again defend and maintain the said Quakers'\r\nheretical opinions, they shall be committed to the house of correction\r\ntill there be convenient passage to send them out of the land, being\r\nsentenced by the court of Assistants to banishment. Lastly, it is hereby\r\nordered, that what person or persons soever, shall revile the persons of\r\nthe magistrates or ministers, as is usual with the Quakers, such person\r\nor persons shall be severely whipped or pay the sum of five pounds.\r\n\r\n\"This is a true copy of the court's order, as attests\r\n\r\n\"EDWARD RAWSON, Sec.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_At a General Court held at Boston, the 14th of October, 1657._\r\n\r\n\"As an addition to the late order, in reference to the coming or\r\nbringing of any of the cursed sect of the Quakers into this\r\njurisdiction, it is ordered, that whosoever shall from henceforth bring,\r\nor cause to be brought, directly or indirectly, any known Quaker or\r\nQuakers, or other blasphemous heretics, into this jurisdiction, every\r\nsuch person shall forfeit the sum of one hundred pounds to the country,\r\nand shall by warrant from any magistrate be committed to prison, there\r\nto remain till the penalty be satisfied and paid; and if any person or\r\npersons within this jurisdiction, shall henceforth entertain and conceal\r\nany such Quaker or Quakers, or other blasphemous heretics, knowing them\r\nso to be, every such person shall forfeit to the country forty shillings\r\nfor every hours' entertainment and concealment of any Quaker or Quakers,\r\n&c. as aforesaid, and shall be committed to prison as aforesaid, till\r\nthe forfeiture be fully satisfied and paid. And it is further ordered,\r\nthat if any Quaker or Quakers shall presume, after they have once\r\nsuffered what the law requires, to come into this jurisdiction, every\r\nsuch male Quaker shall, for the first offence, have one of his ears cut\r\noff, and be kept at work in the house of correction, till he can be sent\r\naway at his own charge; and for the second offence, shall have his other\r\near cut off; and every woman Quaker, that has suffered the law here,\r\nthat shall presume to come into this jurisdiction, shall be severely\r\nwhipped, and kept at the house of correction at work, till she be sent\r\naway at her own charge, and so also for her coming again, she shall be\r\nalike used as aforesaid. And for every Quaker, he or she, that shall a\r\nthird time herein again offend, they shall have their tongues bored\r\nthrough with a hot iron, and be kept at the house of correction close to\r\nwork, till they be sent away at their own charge. And it is further\r\nordered, that all and every Quaker arising from among ourselves, shall\r\nbe dealt with, and suffer the like punishment as the law provides\r\nagainst foreign Quakers.\r\n\r\n        \"EDWARD RAWSON, Sec.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"An Act made at a General Court, held at Boston, the 20th of October,\r\n1658._\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, there is a pernicious sect, commonly called Quakers, lately\r\nrisen, who by word and writing have published and maintained many\r\ndangerous and horrid tenets, and do take upon them to change and alter\r\nthe received laudable customs of our nation, in giving civil respect to\r\nequals, or reverence to superiors; whose actions tend to undermine the\r\ncivil government, and also to destroy the order of the churches, by\r\ndenying all established forms of worship, and by withdrawing from\r\norderly church fellowship, allowed and approved by all orthodox\r\nprofessors of truth, and instead thereof, and in opposition thereunto,\r\nfrequently meeting by themselves, insinuating themselves into the minds\r\nof the simple, or such as are at least affected to the order and\r\ngovernment of church and commonwealth, whereby divers of our inhabitants\r\nhave been infected, notwithstanding all former laws, made upon the\r\nexperience of their arrogant and bold obtrusions, to disseminate their\r\nprinciples amongst us, prohibiting their coming into this jurisdiction,\r\nthey have not been deterred from their impious attempts to undermine our\r\npeace, and hazard our ruin.\r\n\r\n\"For prevention thereof, this court doth order and enact, that any\r\nperson or persons, of the cursed sect of the Quakers, who is not an\r\ninhabitant of, but is found within this jurisdiction, shall be\r\napprehended without warrant, where no magistrate is hand, by any\r\nconstable commissioner, or select-man, and conveyed from constable to\r\nconstable, to the next magistrate, who shall commit the said person to\r\nclose prison, there to remain (without bail) until the next court of\r\nAssistants, where they shall have legal trial. And being convicted to be\r\nof the sect of the Quakers, shall be sentenced to banishment, on pain of\r\ndeath. And that every inhabitant of this jurisdiction, being convicted\r\nto be of the aforesaid sect, either by taking up, publishing, or\r\ndefending the horrid opinions of the Quakers, or the stirring up mutiny,\r\nsedition, or rebellion against the government, or by taking up their\r\nabusive and destructive practices, viz. denying civil respect to equals\r\nand superiors, and withdrawing from the church assemblies; and instead\r\nthereof, frequenting meetings of their own, in opposition to our church\r\norder; adhering to, or approving of any known Quaker, and the tenets and\r\npractices of Quakers, that are opposite to the orthodox received\r\nopinions of the godly; and endeaving to disaffect others to civil\r\ngovernment and church order, or condemning the practice and proceedings\r\nof this court against the Quakers, manifesting thereby their complying\r\nwith those, whose design is to overthrow the order established in church\r\nand state: every such person, upon conviction before the said court of\r\nAssistants, in manner aforesaid, shall be committed to close prison for\r\none month, and then, unless they choose voluntarily to depart this\r\njurisdiction, shall give bond for their good behaviour and appear at the\r\nnext court, where, continuing obstinate, and refusing to retract and\r\nreform the aforesaid opinions, they shall be sentenced to banishment,\r\nupon pain of death. And any one magistrate, upon information given him\r\nof any such person, shall cause him to be apprehended, and shall commit\r\nany such person to prison, according to his discretion, until he come to\r\ntrial as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears there were also laws passed in both of the then colonies of\r\nNew-Plymouth and New-Haven, and in the Dutch settlement at\r\nNew-Amsterdam, now New-York, prohibiting the people called Quakers, from\r\ncoming into those places, under severe penalties; in consequence of\r\nwhich, some underwent considerable suffering.\r\n\r\nThe two first who were executed were William Robinson, merchant, of\r\nLondon, and Marmaduke Stevenson, a countryman, of Yorkshire. These\r\ncoming to Boston, in the beginning of September, were sent for by the\r\ncourt of Assistants, and there sentenced to banishment, on pain of\r\ndeath. This sentence was passed also on Mary Dyar, mentioned hereafter,\r\nand Nicholas Davis, who were both at Boston. But William Robinson, being\r\nlooked upon as a teacher, was also condemned to be whipped severely; and\r\nthe constable was commanded to get an able man to do it. Then Robinson\r\nwas brought into the street, and there stripped; and having his hands\r\nput through the holes of the carriage of a great gun, where the jailer\r\nheld him, the executioner gave him twenty stripes, with a three-fold\r\ncord-whip. Then he and the other prisoners were shortly after released,\r\nand banished, as appears from the following warrant:\r\n\r\n    \"You are required by these, presently to set at\r\n    liberty William Robinson, Marmaduke Stevenson, Mary\r\n    Dyar, and Nicholas Davis, who, by an order of the\r\n    court and council, had been imprisoned, because it\r\n    appeared by their own confession, words, and\r\n    actions, that they are Quakers: wherefore, a\r\n    sentence was pronounced against them, to depart\r\n    this jurisdiction, on pain of death; and that they\r\n    must answer it at their peril, if they, or any of\r\n    them, after the 14th of this present month,\r\n    September, are found within this jurisdiction, or\r\n    any part thereof.\r\n\r\n                                     \"EDWARD RAWSON\"\r\n\r\n    \"Boston, September 12, 1659.\"\r\n\r\nThough Mary Dyar and Nicholas Davis left that jurisdiction for that\r\ntime, yet Robinson and Stevenson, though they departed the town of\r\nBoston, could not yet resolve (not being free in mind) to depart that\r\njurisdiction, though their lives were at stake. And so they went to\r\nSalem, and some places thereabout, to visit and build up their friends\r\nin the faith. But it was not long before they were taken, and put again\r\ninto prison at Boston, and chains locked to their legs. In the next\r\nmonth, Mary Dyar returned also. And as she stood before the prison,\r\nspeaking with one Christopher Holden, who was come thither to inquire\r\nfor a ship bound for England, whither he intended to go, she was also\r\ntaken into custody. Thus, they had now three persons, who, according to\r\ntheir law, had forfeited their lives. And, on the 20th of October, these\r\nthree were brought into court, where John Endicot and others were\r\nassembled. And being called to the bar, Endicot commanded the keeper to\r\npull off their hats; and then said, that they had made several laws to\r\nkeep the Quakers from amongst them, and neither whipping, nor\r\nimprisoning, nor cutting off ears, nor banishing upon pain of death,\r\nwould keep them from amongst them. And further, he said, that he or they\r\ndesired not the death of any of them. Yet, notwithstanding, his\r\nfollowing words, without more ado, were, \"Give ear, and hearken to your\r\nsentence of death.\" Sentence of death was also passed upon Marmaduke\r\nStevenson, Mary Dyar, and William Edrid. Several others were imprisoned,\r\nwhipped, and fined. We have no disposition to justify the Pilgrims for\r\nthese proceedings, but we think, considering the circumstances of the\r\nage in which they lived, their conduct admits of much palliation. The\r\nfollowing remarks of Mr. Hawes, in his tribute to the memory of the\r\nPilgrims, are worthy of serious consideration.\r\n\r\n\"It is alleged that they enacted laws which were oppressive to other\r\ndenominations, and, moreover, that they were actually guilty of\r\npersecution. This, indeed, is a serious charge, and to some extent must\r\nbe admitted to be true. And yet whoever candidly examines the facts in\r\nthe case, will find abundant evidence that our fathers, in this respect,\r\nwere far from being sinners above all who have dwelt on the earth. Many\r\nof the laws that are complained of were enacted when there were few or\r\nnone of any other denomination in the land. They were designed to\r\nprotect and support their own ecclesiastical and civil order; and not to\r\noperate at all as persecuting or oppressive enactments against\r\nchristians belonging to other sects. It is also true that most of those\r\npersons who are said to have been persecuted and oppressed, suffered not\r\nso much for their religious opinions, as for their offences against the\r\nstate. Some of them outraged all decency and order, and committed such\r\nacts as would unquestionably, at the present day, subject a man to\r\nimprisonment, if not to severer punishment.\r\n\r\n\"This, according to Winthrop, was the ground of the sentence of\r\nbanishment, passed on Roger Williams. 'He broached and divulged divers\r\nnew opinions against the authority of magistrates, as also wrote letters\r\nof defamation both of the magistrates and churches.'\"--_Winthrop's Hist.\r\nof N. E. edit. by Savage, vol. 1, p. 167._\r\n\r\n\"For a particular account of the causes for which Mr. Williams was\r\nbanished, see Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts, vol. 1, p. 41;\r\nDwight's Travels, vol. 1, p. 142; Magnalia, vol. 2, p. 430. As for the\r\nlaws subsequently enacted against the Baptists and Quakers, no one most\r\ncertainly can justify them. They were oppressive and wrong. But let no\r\none reproach, too severely, the memory of our fathers, in this matter,\r\ntill he is certain, that _in similar circumstances_, he would have shown\r\na better temper.\r\n\r\n\"It is allowed that they were culpable; but we do not concede, that in\r\nthe present instance, they stood alone, or that they merited all the\r\ncensure bestowed on them. 'Laws similar to those of Massachusetts were\r\npassed elsewhere against the Quakers and also against the Baptists,\r\nparticularly in Virginia. If no execution took place here, it was not\r\nowing to the moderation of the church.'\"--_Jefferson Virg. Query,\r\nXVIII._\r\n\r\n\"The prevalent opinion among most sects of christians, at that day, that\r\ntoleration is sinful, ought to be remembered; nor should it be\r\nforgotten, that the first Quakers in New England, besides speaking and\r\nwriting what was deemed blasphemous, reviled magistrates and ministers,\r\nand disturbed religious assemblies; and that the tendency of their\r\nopinions and practices was to the subversion of the commonwealth in the\r\nperiod of its infancy.\"--_Holmes' Am. Annals. Hutch. vol. 1, p. 180-9._\r\n\r\n\"It should be added, that in Massachusetts the law which enacted that\r\nall Quakers returning into the state after banishment, should be\r\npunished with death, and under which four persons were executed, met\r\nwith great, and at first, successful opposition. The deputies, who\r\nconstituted the popular branch of the legislature, at first rejected it;\r\nbut afterwards, on reconsideration, concurred with the magistrates, (by\r\nwhom it was originally proposed,) by a majority of only one.\"--_Chr.\r\nSpect. 1830, p. 266._\r\n\r\n\"The fathers of New England, endured incredible hardships in providing\r\nfor themselves a home in the wilderness; and to protect themselves in\r\nthe undisturbed enjoyment of rights, which they had purchased at so dear\r\na rate, they sometimes adopted measures which, if tried by the more\r\nenlightened and liberal views of the present day, must at once be\r\npronounced altogether unjustifiable. But shall they be condemned without\r\nmercy for not acting up to principles which were unacknowledged and\r\nunknown throughout the whole of christendom? Shall they alone be held\r\nresponsible for opinions and conduct which had become sacred by\r\nantiquity, and which were common to christians of all other\r\ndenominations? Every government then in existence assumed to itself the\r\nright to legislate in matters of religion; and to restrain heresy by\r\npenal statutes. This right was claimed by rulers, admitted by subjects,\r\nand is sanctioned by the names of Lord Bacon and Montesquieu, and many\r\nothers equally famed for their talents and learning. It is unjust then,\r\nto 'press upon one poor persecuted sect, the sins of all christendom?'\r\nThe fault of our fathers was the fault of the age; and though this\r\ncannot justify, it certainly furnishes an extenuation of their conduct.\r\nAs well might you condemn them for not understanding the art of\r\nnavigating by steam, as for not understanding and acting up to the\r\nprinciples of religious toleration. At the same time, it is but just to\r\nsay, that imperfect as were their views of the rights of conscience,\r\nthey were nevertheless far in advance of the age to which they\r\nbelonged; and it is to them more than to any other class of men on\r\nearth, the world is indebted for the more rational views that now\r\nprevail on the subject of civil and religious liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nPERSECUTIONS OF THE FRENCH PROTESTANTS IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE, DURING\r\nTHE YEARS 1814 AND 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe persecution in this protestant part of France continued with very\r\nlittle intermission from the revocation of the edict of Nantes, by Louis\r\nXIV. till a very short period previous to the commencement of the late\r\nFrench revolution. In the year 1785, M. Rebaut St. Etienne and the\r\ncelebrated M. de la Fayette were among the first persons who interested\r\nthemselves with the court of Louis XVI., in removing the scourge of\r\npersecution from this injured people, the inhabitants of the south of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nSuch was the opposition on the part of the catholics and the courtiers,\r\nthat it was not till the end of the year 1790, that the protestants were\r\nfreed from their alarms. Previously to this, the catholics at Nismes in\r\nparticular, had taken up arms; Nismes then presented a frightful\r\nspectacle; armed men ran through the city, fired from the corners of the\r\nstreets, and attacked all they met with swords and forks. A man named\r\nAstuc was wounded and thrown into the aqueduct; Baudon fell under the\r\nrepeated strokes of bayonets and sabres, and his body was also thrown\r\ninto the water; Boucher, a young man only 17 years of age, was shot as\r\nhe was looking out of his window; three electors wounded, one\r\ndangerously; another elector wounded, only escaped death by repeatedly\r\ndeclaring he was a catholic; a third received four sabre wounds, and was\r\ntaken home dreadfully mangled. The citizens that fled were arrested by\r\nthe catholics upon the roads, and obliged to give proofs of their\r\nreligion before their lives were granted. M. and Madame Vogue, were at\r\ntheir country house, which the zealots broke open, where they massacred\r\nboth, and destroyed their dwelling. M. Blacher, a protestant seventy\r\nyears of age, was cut to pieces with a sickle; young Pyerre, carrying\r\nsome food to his brother, was asked, \"Catholic or protestant?\"\r\n\"Protestant,\" being the reply, a monster fired at the lad, and he fell.\r\nOne of the murderer's companions said, \"you might as well have killed a\r\nlamb.\" \"I have sworn,\" replied he, \"to kill four protestants for my\r\nshare, and this will count for one.\" However, as these atrocities\r\nprovoked the troops to unite in defence of the people, a terrible\r\nvengeance was retaliated upon the catholic party that had used arms,\r\nwhich with other circumstances, especially the toleration exercised by\r\nNapoleon Buonaparte, kept them down completely till the year 1814, when\r\nthe unexpected return of the ancient government rallied them all once\r\nmore round the old banners.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The arrival of King Louis XVIII. at Paris._\r\n\r\nThis was known at Nismes on the 13th of April, 1814. In a quarter of an\r\nhour, the white cockade was seen in every direction, the white flag\r\nfloated on the public buildings, on the splendid monuments of antiquity,\r\nand even on the tower of Mange, beyond the city walls. The protestants,\r\nwhose commerce had suffered materially during the war, were among the\r\nfirst to unite in the general joy, and to send in their adhesion to the\r\nsenate, and the legislative body; and several of the protestant\r\ndepartments sent addresses to the throne, but unfortunately, M. Froment\r\nwas again at Nismes at the moment when many bigots being ready to join\r\nhim, the blindness and fury of the sixteenth century rapidly succeeded\r\nthe intelligence and philanthropy of the nineteenth. A line of\r\ndistinction was instantly traced between men of different religious\r\nopinions; the spirit of the old catholic church was again to regulate\r\neach person's share of esteem and safety. The difference of religion was\r\nnow to govern every thing else; and even catholic domestics who had\r\nserved protestants with zeal and affection, began to neglect their\r\nduties, or to perform them ungraciously, and with reluctance. At the\r\nfetes and spectacles that were given at the public expense, the absence\r\nof the protestants was charged on them as a proof of their disloyalty;\r\nand in the midst of the cries of \"_Vive le Roi_,\" the discordant sounds\r\nof \"_A bas le Maire_,\" down with the mayor, were heard. M. Castletan was\r\na protestant; he appeared in public with the prefect M. Ruland, a\r\ncatholic, when potatoes were thrown at him, and the people declared that\r\nhe ought to resign his office. The bigots of Nismes even succeeded in\r\nprocuring an address to be presented to the king, stating that there\r\nought to be in France but one God, one king, and one faith. In this they\r\nwere imitated by the catholics of several towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The History of the Silver Child._\r\n\r\nAbout this time, M. Baron, counsellor of the Cour Royale of Nismes,\r\nformed the plan of dedicating to God a silver child, if the Duchess\r\nd'Angouleme would give a prince to France. This project was converted\r\ninto a public religious vow, which was the subject of conversation both\r\nin public and private, whilst persons, whose imaginations were inflamed\r\nby these proceedings, run about the streets crying _Vivent les\r\nBourbons_, or the Bourbons forever. In consequence of this superstitious\r\nfrenzy, it is said that, at Alais, women were advised and instigated to\r\npoison their protestant husbands, and at length it was found convenient\r\nto accuse them of political crimes. They could no longer appear in\r\npublic without insults and injuries. When the mobs met with protestants,\r\nthey seized them, and danced round them with barbarous joy, and amidst\r\nrepeated cries of _Vive le Roi_, they sung verses, the burden of which\r\nwas, \"We will wash our hands in protestant blood, and make black\r\npuddings of the blood of Calvin's children.\" The citizens who came to\r\nthe promenades for air and refreshment, from the close and dirty\r\nstreets, were chased with shouts of _Vive le Roi_, as if those shouts\r\nwere to justify every excess. If protestants referred to the charter,\r\nthey were directly assured it would be of no use to them, and that they\r\nhad only been managed to be more effectually destroyed. Persons of rank\r\nwere heard to say in the public streets, \"All the Huguenots must be\r\nkilled; this time their children must be killed, that none of the\r\naccursed race may remain.\" Still, it is true, they were not murdered,\r\nbut cruelly treated, protestant children could no longer mix in the\r\nsports of catholics, and were not even permitted to appear without their\r\nparents. At dark their families shut themselves up in their apartments;\r\nbut even then stones were thrown against their windows. When they arose\r\nin the morning, it was not uncommon to find gibbets drawn on their doors\r\nor walls; and in the streets the catholics held cords already soaped\r\nbefore their eyes, and pointed out the instruments by which they hoped\r\nand designed to exterminate them. Small gallows or models were handed\r\nabout, and a man who lived opposite to one of the pastors, exhibited one\r\nof these models in his window, and made signs sufficiently intelligible\r\nwhen the minister passed. A figure representing a protestant preacher\r\nwas also hung up on a public crossway, and the most atrocious songs were\r\nsung under his window. Towards the conclusion of the carnival, a plan\r\nhad even been formed to make a caricature of the four ministers of the\r\nplace, and burn them in effigy; but this was prevented by the mayor of\r\nNismes, a protestant. A dreadful song presented to the prefect, in the\r\ncountry dialect, with a false translation, was printed by his approval,\r\nand had a great run before he saw the extent of the error into which he\r\nhad been betrayed. The sixty-third regiment of the line was publicly\r\ncensured and insulted, for having, according to order, protected\r\nprotestants. In fact, the protestants seemed to be as sheep destined for\r\nthe slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Napoleon's Return from the Isle of Elba._\r\n\r\nSoon after this event, the duke d'Angouleme was at Nismes, and remained\r\nthere some time; but even his influence was insufficient to bring about\r\na reconciliation between the catholics and the protestants of that city.\r\nDuring the hundred days betwixt Napoleon's return from the Isle of Elba,\r\nand his final downfall, not a single life was lost in Nismes, not a\r\nsingle house was pillaged; only four of the most notorious disturbers of\r\nthe peace were punished, or rather prevented from doing mischief, and\r\neven this was not an act of the protestant but the _arrete_ of the\r\ncatholic prefect, announced every where with the utmost publicity. Some\r\ntime after, when M. Baron, who proposed the vow of the silver child in\r\nfavour of the Duchess d'Angouleme, who was considered as the chief of\r\nthe catholic royalists, was discovered at the bottom of an old wine tun,\r\nthe populace threw stones at his carriage, and vented their feelings in\r\nabusive language. The protestant officers protected him from injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Catholic arms at Beaucaire._\r\n\r\nIn May, 1815, a federative association, similar to those of Lyons,\r\nGrenoble, Paris, Avignon, and Montpelier, was desired by many persons at\r\nNismes; but this federation terminated here after an ephemeral and\r\nillusory existence of fourteen days. In the mean while a large party of\r\ncatholic zealots were in arms at Beaucaire, and who soon pushed their\r\npatroles so near the walls of Nismes, \"as to alarm the inhabitants.\"\r\nThese catholics applied to the English off Marseilles for assistance,\r\nand obtained the grant of 1000 muskets, 10,000 cartouches, &c. General\r\nGilly, however, was soon sent against these partizans, who prevented\r\nthem from coming to extremes, by granting them an armistice; and yet\r\nwhen Louis XVIII. had returned to Paris, after the expiration of\r\nNapoleon's reign of a hundred days, and peace and party spirit seemed to\r\nhave been subdued, even at Nismes, bands from Beaucaire joined\r\nTrestaillon in this city, to glut the vengeance they had so long\r\npremeditated. General Gilly had left the department several days: the\r\ntroops of the line left behind had taken the white cockade, and waited\r\nfarther orders, whilst the new commissioners had only to proclaim the\r\ncessation of hostilities, and the complete establishment of the king's\r\nauthority. In vain, no commissioners appeared, no despatches arrived to\r\ncalm and regulate the public mind; but towards evening the advanced\r\nguard of the banditti, to the amount of several hundreds, entered the\r\ncity, undesired but unopposed. As they marched without order or\r\ndiscipline, covered with clothes or rags of all colours, decorated with\r\ncockades not _white_, but _white_ and _green_, armed with muskets,\r\nsabres, forks, pistols and reaping hooks, intoxicated with wine, and\r\nstained with the blood of the protestants whom they had murdered on\r\ntheir route, they presented a most hideous and appalling spectacle. In\r\nthe open place in the front of the barracks, this banditti was joined by\r\nthe city armed mob, headed by Jaques Dupont, commonly called\r\nTrestaillon. To save the effusion of blood, this garrison of about 500\r\nmen consented to capitulate, and marched out sad and defenceless; but\r\nwhen about fifty had passed, the rabble commenced a tremendous fire on\r\ntheir confiding and unprotected victims; nearly all were killed or\r\nwounded, and but very few could re-enter the yard before the garrison\r\ngates were again closed. These were again forced in an instant, and all\r\nwere massacred who could not climb over roofs, or leap into the\r\nadjoining gardens. In a word, death met them in every place and in\r\nevery shape and this catholic massacre rivalled in cruelty, and\r\nsurpassed in treachery, the crimes of the September assassins of Paris\r\nand the Jacobinical butcheries of Lyons and Avignon. It was marked, not\r\nonly by the fervour of the revolution, but by the subtlety of the\r\nleague, and will long remain a blot upon the history of the second\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Massacre and Pillage at Nismes._\r\n\r\nNismes now exhibited a most awful scene of outrage and carnage, though\r\nmany of the protestants had fled to the Convennes and the Gardonenque.\r\nThe country houses of Messrs. Rey, Guiret, and several others, had been\r\npillaged, and the inhabitants treated with wanton barbarity. Two parties\r\nhad glutted their savage appetites on the farm of Madame Frat: the\r\nfirst, after eating, drinking, and breaking the furniture, and stealing\r\nwhat they thought proper, took leave by announcing the arrival of their\r\ncomrades, \"compared with whom,\" they said, \"they should be thought\r\nmerciful.\" Three men and an old woman were left on the premises: at the\r\nsight of the second company two of the men fled. \"Are you a catholic?\"\r\nsaid the banditti to the old woman. \"Yes.\" \"Repeat, then, your Pater and\r\nAve.\" Being terrified she hesitated, and was instantly knocked down with\r\na musket. On recovering her senses, she stole out of the house, but met\r\nLadet, the old _valet de ferme_, bringing in a salad which the\r\ndepredators had ordered him to cut. In vain she endeavoured to persuade\r\nhim to fly. \"Are you a protestant?\" they exclaimed; \"I am.\" A musket\r\nbeing discharged at him, he fell wounded, but not dead. To consummate\r\ntheir work, the monsters lighted a fire with straw and boards, threw\r\ntheir yet living victim into the flames, and suffered him to expire in\r\nthe most dreadful agonies. They then ate their salad, omelet, &c. The\r\nnext day, some labourers, seeing the house open and deserted, entered\r\nand discovered the half consumed body of Ladet. The prefect of the Gard,\r\nM. Darbaud Jouques, attempting to palliate the crimes of the catholics,\r\nhad the audacity to assert that Ladet was a catholic; but this was\r\npublicly contradicted by two of the pastors at Nismes.\r\n\r\nAnother party committed a dreadful murder at St. Cezaire, upon Imbert la\r\nPlume, the husband of Suzon Chivas. He was met on returning from work in\r\nthe fields. The chief promised him his life, but insisted that he must\r\nbe conducted to the prison at Nismes. Seeing, however, that the party\r\nwas determined to kill him, he resumed his natural character, and being\r\na powerful and courageous man advanced and exclaimed, \"You are\r\nbrigands--fire!\" Four of them fired, and he fell, but he was not dead;\r\nand while living they mutilated his body and then passing a cord round\r\nit, drew it along, attached to a cannon of which they had possession. It\r\nwas not till after eight days that his relatives were apprized of his\r\ndeath. Five individuals of the family of Chivas, all husbands and\r\nfathers, were massacred in the course of a few days.\r\n\r\nNear the barracks at Nismes is a large and handsome house, the property\r\nof M. Vitte, which he acquired by exertion and economy. Besides\r\ncomfortable lodgings for his own family, he let more than twenty\r\nchambers, mostly occupied by superior officers and commissaries of the\r\narmy. He never inquired the opinion of his tenants, and of course his\r\nguests were persons of all political parties; but, under pretence of\r\nsearching for concealed officers, his apartments were overrun, his\r\nfurniture broken, and his property carried off at pleasure. The houses\r\nof Messrs. Lagorce, most respectable merchants and manufacturers M.\r\nMatthieu, M. Negre, and others, shared the same fate: many only avoided\r\nby the owners paying large sums as commutation money, or escaping into\r\nthe country with their cash.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interference of Government against the Protestants._\r\n\r\nM. Bernis, extraordinary royal commissioner, in consequence of these\r\nabuses, issued a proclamation which reflects disgrace on the authority\r\nfrom whence it emanated. \"Considering,\" it said, \"that the residence of\r\ncitizens in places foreign to their domicile, can only be prejudicial to\r\nthe _communes_ they have left, and to those to which they have repaired,\r\nit is ordered, that those inhabitants who have quitted their residence\r\nsince the commandment of July, return home by the 28th at the latest,\r\notherwise they shall be deemed accomplices of the evil-disposed persons\r\nwho disturb the public tranquility, and their property shall be placed\r\nunder provisional _sequestration_.\"\r\n\r\nThe fugitives had sufficient inducements to return to their hearths,\r\nwithout the fear of sequestration. They were more anxious to embrace\r\ntheir fathers, mothers, wives, and children, and to resume their\r\nordinary occupations, than M. Bernis could be to insure their return.\r\nBut thus denouncing men as criminals who fled for safety from the sabres\r\nof assassins, was adding oil to the fire of persecution. Trestaillon,\r\none of the chiefs of the brigands, was dressed in complete uniform and\r\nepaulettes which he had stolen; he wore a sabre at his side, pistols in\r\nhis belt, a cockade of white and green, and a sash of the same colours\r\non his arm. He had under him, Truphemy, Servan, Aime, and many other\r\ndesperate characters. Some time after this M. Bernis ordered all parties\r\nand individuals, armed or unarmed, to abstain from searching houses,\r\nwithout either an order, or the presence of an officer. On suspicion of\r\narms being concealed, the commandant of the town was ordered to furnish\r\na patrol to make search and seizure; and all persons carrying arms in\r\nthe streets, without being on service, were to be arrested. Trestaillon,\r\nhowever, who still carried arms, was not arrested till some months\r\nafter, and then not by these authorities, but by General La Garde, who\r\nwas afterwards assassinated by one of his comrades. On this occasion it\r\nwas remarked, that \"the system of specious and deceptive proclamations\r\nwas perfectly understood, and had long been practised in Languedoc; it\r\nwas _not too late_ to persecute the protestants simply for their\r\nreligion. Even in the good times of Louis XIV. there was public opinion\r\nenough in Europe to make that arch tyrant have recourse to the meanest\r\nstratagems.\" The following single specimen of the plan pursued by the\r\nauthors of the Dragonades may serve as a key to all the plausible\r\nproclamations which, in 1815, covered the perpetration of the most\r\ndeliberate and extensive crimes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letters from Louvois to Marillac._\r\n\r\n\"The king rejoices to learn from your letters, that there are so many\r\nconversions in your department; and he desires that you would continue\r\nyour efforts, and employ the same means that have been hitherto so\r\nsuccessful. His majesty has ordered me to send a regiment of cavalry,\r\nthe greatest part of which he wishes to be quartered upon the\r\nprotestants, but he does not think it _prudent_ that they should be all\r\nlodged with them; that is to say, of twenty-six masters, of which a\r\ncompany is composed, if, by a judicious distribution, ten ought to be\r\nreceived by the protestants, give them twenty, and put them all on the\r\nrich, making this pretence, that when there are not soldiers enough in a\r\ntown for all to have some, the poor ought to be exempt, and the rich\r\nburdened. His majesty has also thought proper to order, that all\r\nconverts be exempted from lodging soldiers for two years. This will\r\noccasion numerous conversions if you take care that it is rigorously\r\nexecuted, and that in all the distributions and passage of troops, by\r\nfar the greatest number are quartered on the rich protestants. His\r\nmajesty particularly enjoins that your orders on this subject, either by\r\nyourself or your sub-delegates, be given by word of mouth to the mayors\r\nand sheriffs, without letting them know that his majesty intends by\r\nthese means to force to become converts, and only explaining to them,\r\nthat you give these orders on the information you have received, that in\r\nthese places the rich are excepted by their influence, to the prejudice\r\nof the poor.\"\r\n\r\nThe merciless treatment of the women, in this persecution at Nismes, was\r\nsuch as would have disgraced any savages ever heard of. The widows Rivet\r\nand Bernard, were forced to sacrifice enormous sums; and the house of\r\nMrs. Lecointe was ravaged, and her goods destroyed. Mrs. F. Didier had\r\nher dwelling sacked and nearly demolished to the foundation. A party of\r\nthese bigots visited the widow Perrin, who lived on a little farm at the\r\nwindmills; having committed every species of devastation, they attacked\r\neven the sanctuary of the dead, which contained the relics of her\r\nfamily. They dragged the coffins out, and scattered the contents over\r\nthe adjacent grounds. In vain this outraged widow collected the bones of\r\nher ancestors and replaced them: they were again dug up; and, after\r\nseveral useless efforts, they were reluctantly left spread over the\r\nsurface of the fields.\r\n\r\nTill the period announced for the sequestration of the property of the\r\nfugitives by _authority_, murder and plunder were the daily employment\r\nof what was called the army of Beaucaire, and the catholics of Nismes.\r\nM. Peyron, of Brossan, had all his property carried off; his wine, oil,\r\nseed, grain, several score of sheep, eight mules, three carts, his\r\nfurniture and effects, all the cash that could be found and he had only\r\nto congratulate himself that his habitation was not consumed, and his\r\nvineyards rooted up. A similar process against several other protestant\r\nfarmers, was also regularly carried on during several days. Many of the\r\nprotestants thus persecuted were well known as staunch royalists; but it\r\nwas enough for their enemies to know that they belonged to the reformed\r\ncommunion; these fanatics were determined not to find either royalists\r\nor citizens worthy the common protection of society. To accuse, condemn,\r\nand destroy a protestant, was a matter that required no hesitation. The\r\nhouse of M. Vitte, near the barracks at Nismes, was broken open, and\r\nevery thing within the walls demolished. A Jew family of lodgers was\r\ndriven out, and all their goods thrown out of the windows. M. Vitte was\r\nseized, robbed of his watch and money, severely wounded, and left for\r\ndead. After he had been fourteen hours in a state of insensibility, a\r\ncommissary of police, touched by his misfortunes, administered some\r\ncordials to revive him; and, as a measure of safety, conducted him to\r\nthe citadel, where he remained many days, whilst his family lamented him\r\nas dead. At length, as there was not the slightest charge against him,\r\nhe obtained his liberation from M. Vidal; but when the Austrians\r\narrived, one of the aids-de-camp, who heard of his sufferings and his\r\nrespectability, sought him out, and furnished an escort to conduct his\r\nfamily to a place of safety. Dalbos, the only city beadle who was a\r\nprotestant, was dragged from his home and led to prison. His niece threw\r\nherself on the neck of one of them and begged for mercy; the ruffian\r\ndashed her to the ground. His sister was driven away by the mob; and he\r\nbeing shot, his body remained a long time exposed to the insults of the\r\nrabble.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Royal Decree in favour of the Persecuted._\r\n\r\nAt length the decree of Louis XVIII., which annulled all the\r\nextraordinary powers conferred either by the king, the princes, or\r\nsubordinate agents, was received at Nismes, and the laws were now to be\r\nadministered by the regular organs, and a new prefect arrived to carry\r\nthem into effect; but in spite of proclamations, the work of\r\ndestruction, stopped for a moment, was not abandoned, but soon renewed\r\nwith fresh vigour and effect. On the 30th of July, Jacques Combe, the\r\nfather of a family, was killed by some of the national guards of Rusau,\r\nand the crime was so public, that the commander of the party restored to\r\nthe family the pocket-book and papers of the deceased. On the following\r\nday tumultuous crowds roamed about the city and suburbs, threatening the\r\nwretched peasants; and on the 1st of August they butchered them without\r\nopposition. About noon on the same day, six armed men, headed by\r\nTruphemy, the butcher, surrounded the house of Monot, a carpenter; two\r\nof the party, who were smiths, had been at work in the house the day\r\nbefore, and had seen a protestant who had taken refuge there, M.\r\nBourillon, who had been a lieutenant in the army, and had retired on a\r\npension. He was a man of an excellent character, peaceable and harmless,\r\nand had never served the emperor Napoleon. Truphemy not knowing him, he\r\nwas pointed out partaking of a frugal breakfast with the family.\r\nTruphemy ordered him to go along with him, adding, \"Your friend,\r\nSaussine, is already in the other world.\" Truphemy placed him in the\r\nmiddle of his troop, and artfully ordered him to cry _Vive l'Empereur_:\r\nhe refused, adding, he had never served the emperor. In vain did the\r\nwomen and children of the house intercede for his life, and praise his\r\namiable and virtuous qualities. He was marched to the Esplanade and\r\nshot, first by Truphemy and then by the others. Several persons\r\nattracted by the firing, approached, but were threatened with a similar\r\nfate. After some time the wretches departed, shouting _Vive le Roi_.\r\nSome women met them, and one of them appeared affected, said one, \"I\r\nhave killed seven to-day, for my share and if you say a word, you shall\r\nbe the eighth.\" Pierre Courbet, a stocking weaver, was torn from his\r\nloom by an armed band, and shot at his own door. His eldest daughter was\r\nknocked down with the butt end of a musket; and a poignard was held at\r\nthe breast of his wife while the mob plundered her apartments. Paul\r\nHeraut, a silk weaver, was literally cut in pieces, in the presence of a\r\nlarge crowd, and amidst the unavailing cries and tears of his wife and\r\nfour young children. The murderers only abandoned the corpse to return\r\nto Heraut's house and secure every thing valuable. The number of murders\r\non this day could not be ascertained. One person saw six bodies at the\r\n_Cours Neuf_, and nine were carried to the hospital.\r\n\r\nIf murder some time after, became less frequent for a few days, pillage\r\nand forced contributions were actively enforced. M. Salle d'Hombro, at\r\nseveral visits was robbed of 7000 francs; and on one occasion, when he\r\npleaded the sacrifices he had made, \"Look,\" said a bandit, pointing to\r\nhis pipe, \"this will set fire to your house; and this,\" brandishing his\r\nsword, \"will finish you.\" No reply could be made to these arguments. M.\r\nFeline, a silk manufacturer, was robbed of 32,000 francs in gold, 3000\r\nfrancs in silver, and several bales of silk.\r\n\r\nThe small shopkeepers were continually exposed to visits and demands of\r\nprovisions, drapery, or whatever they sold; and the same hands that set\r\nfire to the houses of the rich, and tore up the vines of the cultivator,\r\nbroke the looms of the weaver, and stole the tools of the artizan.\r\nDesolation reigned in the sanctuary and in the city. The armed bands,\r\ninstead of being reduced, were increased; the fugitives, instead of\r\nreturning received constant accessions, and their friends who sheltered\r\nthem were deemed rebellious. Those protestants who remained, were\r\ndeprived of all their civil and religious rights, and even the advocates\r\nand huissiers entered into a resolution to exclude all of \"the pretended\r\nreformed religion\" from their bodies. Those who were employed in\r\nselling tobacco were deprived of their licenses. The protestant deacons\r\nwho had the charge of the poor were all scattered. Of five pastors only\r\ntwo remained; one of these was obliged to change his residence, and\r\ncould only venture to administer the consolations of religion, or\r\nperform the functions of his ministry, under cover of the night.\r\n\r\nNot content with these modes of torment, calumnious and inflamatory\r\npublications charged the protestants with raising the proscribed\r\nstandard in the communes, and invoking the fallen Napoleon; and, of\r\ncourse, as unworthy the protection of the laws and the favour of the\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\nHundreds after this were dragged to prison without even so much as a\r\n_written order_; and though an official newspaper, bearing the title of\r\nthe _Journal du Gard_, was set up for five months, while it was\r\ninfluenced by the prefect, the mayor, and other functionaries, the word\r\n_charter_ was never once used in it. One of the first numbers, on the\r\ncontrary, represented the suffering protestants as \"Crocodiles only\r\nweeping from rage and regret that they had no more victims to devour; as\r\npersons who had surpassed Danton, Marat, and Robespierre, in doing\r\nmischief: and as having prostituted their daughters to the garrison to\r\ngain it over to Napoleon.\" An extract from this article, stamped with\r\nthe crown and the arms of the Bourbons, was hawked about the streets,\r\nand the vender was adorned with the medal of the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Petition of the Protestant Refugees._\r\n\r\nTo these reproaches it is proper to oppose the petition which the\r\nProtestant Refugees in Paris presented to Louis XVIII. in behalf of\r\ntheir brethren at Nismes.\r\n\r\n\"We lay at your feet, sire, our acute sufferings. In your name our\r\nfellow-citizens are slaughtered, and their property laid waste. Misled\r\npeasants, in pretended obedience to your orders, had assembled at the\r\ncommand of a commissioner appointed by your august nephew. Although\r\nready to attack us, they were received with the assurances of peace. On\r\nthe 15th of July, 1815, we learnt your majesty's entrance into Paris,\r\nand the white flag immediately waved on our edifices. The public\r\ntranquility had not been disturbed, when armed peasants introduced\r\nthemselves. The garrison capitulated, but were assailed on their\r\ndeparture, and almost totally massacred. Our national guard was\r\ndisarmed, the city filled with strangers, and the houses of the\r\nprincipal inhabitants, professing the reformed religion, were attacked\r\nand plundered. We subjoin the list. Terror has driven from our city the\r\nmost respectable inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty has been deceived if there has not been placed before you\r\nthe picture of the horrors which make a desert of your good city of\r\nNismes. Arrests and proscriptions are continually taking place, and\r\ndifference of _religious_ opinions is the real and only cause. The\r\ncalumniated protestants are the defenders of the throne. Your nephew has\r\nbeheld our children under his banners; our fortunes have been placed in\r\nhis hands. Attacked without reason, the protestants have not, even by a\r\njust resistance, afforded their enemies the fatal pretext for calumny.\r\nSave us, sire! extinguish the brand of civil war; a single act of your\r\nwill would restore to political existence a city interesting for its\r\npopulation and its manufactures. Demand an account of their conduct from\r\nthe chiefs who have brought our misfortunes upon us. We place before\r\nyour eyes all the documents that have reached us. Fear paralizes the\r\nhearts, and stifles the complaints of our fellow-citizens. Placed in a\r\nmore secure situation, we venture to raise our voice in their behalf,\"\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monstrous outrage upon Females._\r\n\r\nAt Nismes it is well known that the women wash their clothes either at\r\nthe fountains, or on the banks of streams. There is a large basin near\r\nthe fountain, where numbers of women may be seen every day, kneeling at\r\nthe edge of the water, and beating the clothes with heavy pieces of wood\r\nin the shape of battledoors. This spot became the scene of the most\r\nshameful and indecent practices. The catholic rabble turned the women's\r\npetticoats over their heads, and so fastened them as to continue their\r\nexposure, and their subjection to a newly invented species of\r\nchastisement; for nails being placed in the wood of the _battoirs_ in\r\nthe form of _fleur-de-lis_, they beat them till the blood streamed from\r\ntheir bodies, and their cries rent the air. Often was death demanded as\r\na commutation of this ignominious punishment, but refused with a\r\nmalignant joy. To carry their outrage to the highest possible degree,\r\nseveral who were in a state of pregnancy were assailed in this manner.\r\nThe scandalous nature of these outrages prevented many of the sufferers\r\nfrom making them public, and, especially, from relating the most\r\naggravating circumstances. \"I have seen,\" says M. Durand, \"a catholic\r\navocat, accompanying the assassins in the fauxbourg Bourgade, arm a\r\nbattoir with sharp nails in the form of _fleur-de-lis_; I have seen them\r\nraise the garments of females, and apply, with heavy blows, to the\r\nbleeding body this _battoir_ or battledoor, to which they gave a name\r\nwhich my pen refuses to record. The cries of the sufferers--the streams\r\nof blood--the murmurs of indignation which were suppressed by\r\nfear--nothing could move them. The surgeons who attended on those women\r\nwho are dead, can attest, by the marks of their wounds, the agonies\r\nwhich they must have endured, which, however horrible, is most strictly\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, during the progress of these horrors and obscenities, so\r\ndisgraceful to France and the catholic religion, the agents of\r\ngovernment had a powerful force under their command, and by honestly\r\nemploying it they might have restored tranquility. Murder and robbery,\r\nhowever, continued, and were winked at, by the catholic magistrates,\r\nwith very few exceptions; the administrative authorities, it is true,\r\nused words in their proclamations, &c. but never had recourse to actions\r\nto stop the enormities of the persecutors, who boldly declared that, on\r\nthe 24th, the anniversary of St. Bartholomew, they intended to make a\r\ngeneral massacre. The members of the reformed church were filled with\r\nterror, and, instead of taking part in the election of deputies, were\r\noccupied as well as they could in providing for their own personal\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrival of the Austrians at Nismes._\r\n\r\nAbout this time, a treaty between the French court and the allied\r\nsovereigns, prohibited the advance of the foreign troops beyond the line\r\nof territory already occupied, and traced by the course of the Loire,\r\nand by the Rhone, below the Ardeche. In violation of this treaty, 4000\r\nAustrians entered Nismes on the 24th of August; under pretence of making\r\nroom for them, French troops, bearing the _feudal_ title of Royal\r\nChasseurs, followed by the murdering bands of the Trestaillons and\r\nQuatretaillons, who continued their march to Alais, where a fair was to\r\nbe held, and carried disorder and alarm into all the communes on that\r\nroute. Nothing now was heard but denunciations of fusillading, burning,\r\nrazing, and annihilating; and while the catholics were feasting and\r\nmurdering at Nismes, the flames of the country houses of the\r\nprotestants, rising one hundred feet in the air, rendered the spectacle\r\nstill more awful and alarming. Unfortunately, some of the peasants,\r\nfalsely charged with the murder of two protestants, were brought to\r\nNismes while the prefect was celebrating the fete of St. Louis. At a\r\nsplendid dinner given to the Austrian commanders, and even without\r\nquitting the table, it appears, that the French prefect placed the fate\r\nand fortune of these unfortunate prisoners at the disposal of Count\r\nStahremberg, who, of course, believing the representations made to him\r\nordered the accused to be immediately shot. To mortify and exhaust the\r\nprotestant communes, the Austrians were directed to occupy them, where\r\nthey completely disarmed the inhabitants without the least opposition.\r\nIn fact, these foreigners were soon undeceived. They expected to meet\r\nthe most perfidious and brutal enemies in arms, and in open rebellion\r\nagainst their king; but, on the contrary, they found them all in peace,\r\nand experienced the most kind and respectful treatment; and though their\r\nduty was a most vexatious and oppressive one, they performed it in\r\ngeneral with moderation. On this account they could not refrain from\r\nexpressing their astonishment at the reports made to them by the\r\nauthorities at Nismes, declaring, \"They had found a population suffering\r\ngreat misfortunes, but no rebels; and that compassion was the only\r\nfeeling that prevailed in their minds.\" The commander himself was so\r\nconvinced of the good disposition of the people of the Cevennes, that he\r\nvisited those districts without an escort, desiring, he said, to travel\r\nin that country as he would in his own. Such confidence was a public\r\nreproach on the authorities at Nismes, and a sentence of condemnation on\r\nall their proceedings.\r\n\r\nAs the persecution of the protestants was spreading into other\r\ndepartments, strong and forcible representations were secretly printed\r\nand made to the king. All the ordinary modes of communication had been\r\nstopped; the secrecy of letters violated, and none circulated but those\r\nrelative to private affairs. Sometimes these letters bore the postmark\r\nof places very distant, and arrived without signatures, and enveloped in\r\nallegorical allusions. In fact, a powerful resistance on the part of the\r\noutraged protestants was at length apprehended, which, in the beginning\r\nof September excited the proclamation of the king, on which it was\r\nobserved, \"that if his majesty had been correctly and fully informed of\r\nall that had taken place, he surely would not have contented himself\r\nwith announcing his severe displeasure to a _misled people, who took\r\njustice into their own hands, and avenged the crimes committed against\r\nroyalty_.\" The proclamation was dictated as though there had not been a\r\nprotestant in the department; it assumed and affirmed throughout the\r\nguilt of the sufferers; and while it deplored the atrocious outrages\r\nendured by the followers of the duke d'Angouleme, (outrages which never\r\nexisted,) the plunder and massacre of the reformed were not even\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nStill disorders kept pace with the proclamations that made a show of\r\nsuppressing them, and the force of the catholic faction also continued\r\nto increase. The catholic populace, notwithstanding the decrees of the\r\nmagistrates, were allowed to retain the arms they had illegally seized,\r\nwhilst the protestants in the departments were disarmed. The members of\r\nthe reformed churches wished at this period to present another memorial\r\nto the government, descriptive of the evils they still suffered, but\r\nthis was not practicable. On the 26th of September, the president of the\r\nconsistory wrote as follows: \"I have only been able to assemble two or\r\nthree members of the consistory pastors or elders. It is impossible to\r\ndraw up a memoir, or to collect facts; so great is the terror, that\r\nevery one is afraid to speak of his own sufferings, or to mention those\r\nhe has been compelled to witness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Outrages committed in the Villages, &c._\r\n\r\nWe now quit Nismes to take a view of the conduct of the persecutors in\r\nthe surrounding country. After the re-establishment of the royal\r\ngovernment, the local authorities were distinguished for their zeal and\r\nforwardness in supporting their employers, and, under pretence of\r\nrebellion, concealment of arms, non-payment of contributions, &c.\r\ntroops, national guards, and armed mobs, were permitted to plunder,\r\narrest, and murder peaceable citizens, not merely with impunity, but\r\nwith encouragement and approbation. At the village of Milhaud, near\r\nNismes, the inhabitants were frequently forced to pay large sums to\r\navoid being pillaged. This, however, would not avail at Madame\r\nTeulon's: On Sunday, the 16th of July, her house and grounds were\r\nravaged; the valuable furniture removed or destroyed, the hay and wood\r\nburnt, and the corpse of a child, buried in the garden, taken up and\r\ndragged round a fire made by the populace. It was with great difficulty\r\nthat M. Teulon escaped with his life. M. Picherol, another protestant,\r\nhad deposited some of his effects with a catholic neighbour; this house\r\nwas attacked, and though all the property of the latter was respected,\r\nthat of his friend was seized and destroyed. At the same village, one of\r\na party doubting whether M. Hermet, a tailor, was the man they wanted,\r\nasked, \"Is he a protestant?\" this he acknowledged. \"Good,\" said they,\r\nand he was instantly murdered. In the Canton of Vauvert, where there was\r\na consistory church, 80,000 francs were extorted. In the communes of\r\nBeauvoisin and Generac similar excesses were committed by a handful of\r\nlicentious men, under the eye of the catholic mayor and to the cries of\r\n\"Vive le Roi.\" St. Gilles was the scene of the must unblushing villainy.\r\nThe protestants, the most wealthy of the inhabitants, were disarmed,\r\nwhilst their houses were pillaged. The mayor was appealed to:--the mayor\r\nlaughed and walked away. This officer had, at his disposal, a national\r\nguard of several hundred men, organised by his own orders. It would be\r\nwearisome to read the lists of the crimes that occurred during many\r\nmonths. At Clavisson the mayor prohibited the protestants the practice\r\nof singing the psalms commonly used in the temple, that, as he said, the\r\ncatholics might not be offended or disturbed.\r\n\r\nAt Sommieres, about ten miles from Nismes, the catholics made a splendid\r\nprocession through the town, which continued till evening and was\r\nsucceeded by the plunder of the protestants. On the arrival of foreign\r\ntroops at Sommieres, the pretended search for arms was resumed; those\r\nwho did not possess muskets were even compelled to buy them on purpose\r\nto surrender them up, and soldiers were quartered on them at six francs\r\nper day till they produced the articles in demand. The protestant church\r\nwhich had been closed, was converted into barracks for the Austrians.\r\nAfter divine service had been suspended for six months at Nismes, the\r\nchurch, by the protestants called the Temple, was re-opened, and public\r\nworship performed on the morning of the 24th of December. On examining\r\nthe belfry, it was discovered that some persons had carried off the\r\nclapper of the bell. As the hour of service approached, a number of men,\r\nwomen, and children, collected at the house of M. Ribot, the pastor, and\r\nthreatened to prevent the worship. At the appointed time, when he\r\nproceeded towards the church, he was surrounded; the most savage shouts\r\nwere raised against him; some of the women seized him by the collar; but\r\nnothing could disturb his firmness, or excite his impatience: he entered\r\nthe house of prayer, and ascended the pulpit; stones were thrown in and\r\nfell among the worshippers; still the congregation remained calm and\r\nattentive, and the service was concluded amidst noise, threats, and\r\noutrage. On retiring many would have been killed but for the chasseurs\r\nof the garrison, who honourably and zealously protected them. From the\r\ncaptain of these chasseurs, M. Ribot soon after received the following\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n                                 \"_January 2, 1816._\r\n\r\n    \"I deeply lament the prejudices of the catholics\r\n    against the _protestants_, who they pretend do not\r\n    love the king. Continue to act as you have hitherto\r\n    done, and time and your conduct will convince the\r\n    catholics to the contrary: should any tumult occur\r\n    similar to that of Saturday last inform me. I\r\n    preserve my reports of these acts, and if the\r\n    agitators prove incorrigible, and forget what they\r\n    owe to the best of kings and the _charter_, I will\r\n    do my duty and inform the government of their\r\n    proceedings. Adieu, my dear sir; assure the\r\n    consistory of my esteem, and of the sense I\r\n    entertain of the moderation with which they have\r\n    met the provocations of the evil-disposed at\r\n    Sommieres. I have the honor to salute you with\r\n    respect.\r\n\r\n        SUVAL DE LAINE.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter to this worthy pastor from the Marquis de Montlord, was\r\nreceived on the 6th of January, to encourage him to unite with all good\r\nmen who believe in God to obtain the punishment of the assassins,\r\nbrigands, and disturbers of public tranquility, and to read the\r\ninstructions he had received from government to this effect publicly.\r\nNotwithstanding this, on the 20th of January, 1816, when the service in\r\ncommemoration of the death of Louis XVI. was celebrated, a procession\r\nbeing formed, the National Guards fired at the white flag suspended from\r\nthe windows of the protestants, and concluded the day by plundering\r\ntheir houses. In the Commune of Angargues, matters were still worse; and\r\nin that of Fontanes, from the entry of the king in 1815, the catholics\r\nbroke all terms with the protestants; by day they insulted them, and in\r\nthe night broke open their doors, or marked them with chalk to be\r\nplundered or burnt. St. Mamert was repeatedly visited by these\r\nrobberies; and at Montmiral, as lately as the 16th of June, 1816, the\r\nprotestants were attacked, beaten, and imprisoned, for daring to\r\ncelebrate the return of a king who had sworn to preserve religious\r\nliberty and to maintain the charter. In fact, to continue the relation\r\nof the scenes that took place in the different departments of the south\r\nof France, would be little better than a repetition of those we have\r\nalready described, excepting a change of names: but the most sanguinary\r\nof all seems that which was perpetrated at Uzes, at the latter end of\r\nAugust, and the burning of several protestants places of worship. These\r\nshameful persecutions continued till after the dissolution of the\r\nChamber of Deputies at the close of the year 1816. After a review of\r\nthese anti-protestant proceedings, the British reader will not think of\r\ncomparing them with the riots of London in 1780, or with those of\r\nBirmingham about 1793; as it is evident that where governments possess\r\nabsolute power, such events could not have been prolonged for many\r\nmonths and even for years over a vast extent of country, had it not been\r\nfor the systematic and powerful support of the higher department of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Farther account of the proceedings of the Catholics at Nismes._\r\n\r\nThe excesses perpetrated in the country it seems did not by any means\r\ndivert the attention of the persecutors from Nismes. October, 1815,\r\ncommenced without any improvement in the principles or measures of the\r\ngovernment, and this was followed by corresponding presumption on the\r\npart of the people. Several houses in the Quartier St. Charles were\r\nsacked, and their wrecks burnt in the streets amidst songs, dances, and\r\nshouts of Vive le Roi. The mayor appeared, but the merry multitude\r\npretended not to know him, and when he ventured to remonstrate, they\r\ntold him, \"his presence was unnecessary, and that he might retire.\"\r\nDuring the 16th of October, every preparation seemed to announce a night\r\nof carnage; orders for assembling and signals for attack were circulated\r\nwith regularity and confidence; Trestaillon reviewed his satellites, and\r\nurged them on to the perpetration of crimes, holding with one of those\r\nwretches the following dialogue:\r\n\r\n_Satellite._ \"If all the protestants, without one exception, are to be\r\nkilled, I will cheerfully join; but as you have so often deceived me,\r\nunless they are all to go I will not stir.\"\r\n\r\n_Trestaillon._ \"Come along, then, for this time not a single man shall\r\nescape.\" This horrid purpose would have been executed had it not been\r\nfor General La Garde, the commandant of the department. It was not till\r\nten o'clock at night that he perceived the danger; he now felt that not\r\na moment could be lost. Crowds were advancing through the suburbs, and\r\nthe streets were filling with ruffians, uttering the most horrid\r\nimprecations. The generale sounded at eleven o'clock, and added to the\r\nconfusion that was now spreading through the city. A few troops rallied\r\nround the Count La Garde, who was wrung with distress at the sight of\r\nthe evil which had arrived at such a pitch. Of this M. Durand, a\r\ncatholic advocate, gave the following account:\r\n\r\n\"It was near midnight, my wife had just fallen asleep; I was writing by\r\nher side, when we were disturbed by a distant noise; drums seemed\r\ncrossing the town in every direction. What could all this mean! To quiet\r\nher alarm, I said it probably announced the arrival or departure of some\r\ntroops of the garrison. But firing and shouts were immediately audible;\r\nand on opening my window I distinguished horrible imprecations mingled\r\nwith cries of _vive le Roi!_ I roused an officer who lodged in the\r\nhouse, and M. Chancel, Director of the Public Works. We went out\r\ntogether, and gained the Boulevarde. The moon shone bright, and almost\r\nevery object was nearly as distinct as day; a furious crowd was pressing\r\non vowing extermination, and the greater part half naked, armed with\r\nknives, muskets, sticks, and sabres. In answer to my inquiries I was\r\ntold the massacre was general, that many had been already killed in the\r\nsuburbs. M. Chancel retired to put on his uniform as captain of the\r\n_Pompiers_; the officers retired to the barracks, and anxious for my\r\nwife I returned home. By the noise I was convinced that persons\r\nfollowed. I crept along in the shadow of the wall, opened my door,\r\nentered, and closed it, leaving a small aperture through which I could\r\nwatch the movements of the party whose arms shone in the moonlight. In a\r\nfew moments some armed men appeared conducting a prisoner to the very\r\nspot where I was concealed. They stopped, I shut my door gently, and\r\nmounted on an alder tree planted against the garden wall. What a scene!\r\na man on his knees imploring mercy from wretches who mocked his agony,\r\nand loaded him with abuse. In the name of my wife and children, he said,\r\nspare me! What have I done? Why would you murder me for nothing? I was\r\non the point of crying out and menacing the murderers with vengeance. I\r\nhad not long to deliberate, the discharge of several fusils terminated\r\nmy suspense; the unhappy supplicant, struck in the loins and the head,\r\nfell to rise no more. The backs of the assassins were towards the tree;\r\nthey retired immediately, reloading their pieces. I descended and\r\napproached the dying man, uttering some deep and dismal groans. Some\r\nNational Guards arrived at the moment, I again retired and shut the\r\ndoor. \"I see,\" said one, \"a dead man.\" \"He sings still,\" said another.\r\n\"It will be better,\" said a third, \"to finish him and put him out of his\r\nmisery.\" Five or six muskets were fired instantly, and the groans\r\nceased. On the following day crowds came to inspect and insult the\r\ndeceased. A day after a massacre was always observed as a sort of fete,\r\nand every occupation was left to go and gaze upon the victims. This was\r\nLouis Lichare, the father of four children; and four years after the\r\nevent, M. Durand verified this account by his oath upon the trial of one\r\nof the murderers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Attack upon the Protestant Churches._\r\n\r\nSome time before the death of general La Garde, the duke d'Angouleme had\r\nvisited Nismes, and other cities in the south, and at the former place\r\nhonoured the members of the protestant consistory with an interview,\r\npromising them protection, and encouraging them to reopen their temple\r\nso long shut up. They have two churches at Nismes, and it was agreed\r\nthat the small one should be preferred on this occasion, and that the\r\nringing of the bell should be omitted, general La Garde declared that he\r\nwould answer with his head for the safety of his congregation. The\r\nprotestants privately informed each other that worship was once more to\r\nbe celebrated at ten o'clock, and they began to assemble silently and\r\ncautiously. It was agreed that M. Juillerat Chasseur should perform the\r\nservice, though such was his conviction of danger that he entreated his\r\nwife, and some of his flock, to remain with their families. The temple\r\nbeing opened only as a matter of form, and in compliance with the orders\r\nof the duke d'Angouleme, this pastor wished to be the only victim. On\r\nhis way to the place he passed numerous groupes who regarded him with\r\nferocious looks. \"This is the time,\" said some, \"to give them the last\r\nblow.\" \"Yes,\" added others, \"and neither women nor children must be\r\nspared.\" One wretch, raising his voice above the rest, exclaimed, \"Ah, I\r\nwill go and get my musket, and ten for my share.\" Through these ominous\r\nsounds M. Juillerat pursued his course, but when he gained the temple\r\nthe sexton had not the courage to open the door, and he was obliged to\r\ndo it himself. As the worshippers arrived they found strange persons in\r\npossession of the adjacent streets, and upon the steps of the church,\r\nvowing their worship should not be performed, and crying, \"Down with the\r\nprotestants! kill them! kill them!\" At ten o'clock the church being\r\nnearly filled, M. J. Chasseur commenced the prayers; a calm that\r\nsucceeded was of short duration. On a sudden the minister was\r\ninterrupted by a violent noise, and a number of persons entered,\r\nuttering the most dreadful cries, mingled with _Vive le Roi!_ but the\r\ngens-d'armes succeeded in excluding these fanatics, and closing the\r\ndoors. The noise and tumult without now redoubled, and the blows of the\r\npopulace trying to break open the doors, caused the house to resound\r\nwith shrieks and groans. The voice of the pastors who endeavoured to\r\nconsole their flock, was inaudible; they attempted in vain to sing the\r\n42d psalm.\r\n\r\nThree quarters of an hour rolled heavily away. \"I placed myself,\" says\r\nMadame Juillerat, \"at the bottom of the pulpit, with my daughter in my\r\narms; my husband at length joined and sustained me; I remembered that it\r\nwas the anniversary of my marriage; after six years of happiness, I\r\nsaid, I am about to die with my husband and my daughter; we shall be\r\nslain at the altar of our God, the victims of a sacred duty, and heaven\r\nwill open to receive us and our unhappy brethren. I blessed the\r\nRedeemer, and without cursing our murderers, I awaited their approach.\"\r\n\r\nM. Oliver, son of a pastor, an officer in the royal troops of the line,\r\nattempted to leave the church, but the friendly sentinels at the door\r\nadvised him to remain besieged with the rest. The national guards\r\nrefused to act, and the fanatical crowd took every advantage of the\r\nabsence of general La Garde, and of their increasing numbers. At length\r\nthe sound of martial music was heard, and voices from without called to\r\nthe besieged, \"Open, open and save yourselves.\" Their first impression\r\nwas a fear of treachery, but they were soon assured that a detachment\r\nreturning from mass was drawn up in front of the church to favour the\r\nretreat of the protestants. The door was opened, and many of them\r\nescaped among the ranks of the soldiers, who had driven the mob before\r\nthem; but this street, as well as others through which the fugitives had\r\nto pass, was soon filled again. The venerable pastor, Olivier Desmond,\r\nbetween 70 and 80 years of age, was surrounded by murderers; they put\r\ntheir fists in his face, and cried, \"Kill the chief of brigands.\" He was\r\npreserved by the firmness of some officers, among whom was his own son;\r\nthey made a bulwark round him with their bodies, and amidst their naked\r\nsabres conducted him to his house. M. Juillerat, who had assisted at\r\ndivine service with his wife at his side and his child in his arms, was\r\npursued and assailed with stones, his mother received a blow on the\r\nhead, and her life was some time in danger. One woman was shamefully\r\nwhipped, and several wounded and dragged along the streets; the number\r\nof protestants more or less ill treated on this occasion amounted to\r\nbetween seventy and eighty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Murder of General La Garde._\r\n\r\nAt length a check was put to these excesses by the report of the murder\r\nof Count La Garde, who, receiving an account of this tumult, mounted his\r\nhorse, and entered one of the streets, to disperse a crowd. A villain\r\nseized his bridle; another presented the muzzle of a pistol close to his\r\nbody, and exclaimed, \"Wretch, you make me retire!\" He immediately fired.\r\nThe murderer was Louis Boissin, a serjeant in the national guard; but,\r\nthough known to every one, no person endeavoured to arrest him, and he\r\neffected his escape. As soon as the general found himself wounded, he\r\ngave orders to the gendarmerie to protect the protestants, and set off\r\non a gallop to his hotel; but fainted immediately on his arrival. On\r\nrecovering, he prevented the surgeon from searching his wound till he\r\nhad written a letter to the government, that, in case of his death, it\r\nmight be known from what quarter the blow came, and that none might dare\r\nto accuse the protestants of this crime. The probable death of this\r\ngeneral produced a small degree of relaxation on the part of their\r\nenemies, and some calm; but the mass of the people had been indulged in\r\nlicentiousness too long to be restrained even by the murder of the\r\nrepresentative of their king. In the evening they again repaired to the\r\ntemple, and with hatchets broke open the door; the dismal noise of their\r\nblows carried terror into the bosom of the protestant families sitting\r\nin their houses in tears. The contents of the poor's box, and the\r\nclothes prepared for distribution, were stolen; the minister's robes\r\nrent in pieces; the books torn up or carried away; the closets were\r\nransacked, but the rooms which contained the archives of the church, and\r\nthe synods, was providentially secured; and had it not been for the\r\nnumerous patrols on foot, the whole would have become the prey of the\r\nflames, and the edifice itself a heap of ruins. In the mean while, the\r\nfanatics openly ascribed the murder of the general to his own\r\nself-devotion, and said \"that it was the will of God.\" Three thousand\r\nfrancs were offered for the apprehension of Boissin; but it was well\r\nknown that the protestants dared not arrest him, and that the fanatics\r\nwould not. During these transactions, the systems of forced conversions\r\nto catholicism was making regular and fearful progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interference of the British Government._\r\n\r\nTo the credit of England, the reports of these cruel persecutions\r\ncarried on against our protestant brethren in France, produced such a\r\nsensation on the part of the government as determined them to interfere;\r\nand now the persecutors of the protestants made this spontaneous act of\r\nhumanity and religion the pretext for charging the sufferers with a\r\ntreasonable correspondence with England; but in this state of their\r\nproceedings, to their great dismay, a letter appeared, sent some time\r\nbefore to England by the duke of Wellington, stating \"that much\r\ninformation existed on the events of the south.\"\r\n\r\nThe ministers of the three denominations in London, anxious not to be\r\nmisled, requested one of their brethren to visit the scenes of\r\npersecution, and examine with impartiality the nature and extent of the\r\nevils they were desirous to relieve. The Rev. Clement Perot undertook\r\nthis difficult task, and fulfilled their wishes with a zeal, prudence,\r\nand devotedness, above all praise. His return furnished abundant and\r\nincontestible proof of a shameful persecution, materials for an appeal\r\nto the British Parliament, and a printed report which was circulated\r\nthrough the continent, and which first conveyed correct information to\r\nthe inhabitants of France.\r\n\r\nForeign interference was now found eminently useful; and the\r\ndeclarations of tolerance which it elicited from the French government,\r\nas well as the more cautious march of the catholic persecutors, operated\r\nas decisive and involuntary acknowledgments of the importance of that\r\ninterference, which some persons at first censured and despised but\r\nthough the stern voice of public opinion in England and elsewhere\r\nproduced a reluctant suspension of massacre and pillage, the murderers\r\nand plunderers were still left unpunished, and even caressed and\r\nrewarded for their crimes; and whilst protestants in France suffered the\r\nmost cruel and degrading pains and penalties for alleged trifling\r\ncrimes, _catholics_, covered with blood, and guilty of numerous and\r\nhorrid murders, were acquitted.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the virtuous indignation expressed by some of the more\r\nenlightened catholics against these abominable proceedings, had no small\r\nshare in restraining them. Many innocent protestants had been condemned\r\nto the galleys and otherwise punished, for supposed crimes, upon the\r\noaths of wretches the most unprincipled and abandoned. M. Madier de\r\nMontgau, judge of the _cour royale_ of Nismes, and president of the\r\n_cour d'assizes_ of the Gard and Vaucluse, upon one occasion felt\r\nhimself compelled to break up the court, rather than take the deposition\r\nof that notorious and sanguinary monster Truphemy: \"In a hall,\" says he,\r\n\"of the Palace of Justice, opposite that in which I sat, several\r\nunfortunate persons persecuted by the faction were upon trial, every\r\ndeposition tending to their crimination was applauded with the cries of\r\n'_Vive le Roi_.' Three times the explosion of this atrocious joy became\r\nso terrible, that it was necessary to send for reinforcements from the\r\nbarracks, and two hundred soldiers were often unable to restrain the\r\npeople. On a sudden the shouts and cries of '_Vive le Roi_' redoubled: a\r\nman arrives, caressed, applauded, borne in triumph--it is the horrible\r\nTruphemy; he approaches the tribunal--he comes to depose against the\r\nprisoners--he is admitted as a witness--he raises his hand to take the\r\noath! Seized with horror at the sight, I rush from my seat, and enter\r\nthe hall of council; my colleagues follow me; in vain they persuade me\r\nto resume my seat; 'No!' exclaimed I, 'I will not consent to see that\r\nwretch admitted to give evidence in a court of justice in the city which\r\nhe has filled with murders; in the palace, on the steps of which he has\r\nmurdered the unfortunate Bourillon. I cannot admit that he should kill\r\nhis victims by his testimonies no more than by his poignards. He an\r\naccuser! he a witness! No, never will I consent to see this monster\r\nrise, in the presence of magistrates, to take a sacrilegious oath, his\r\nhand still reeking with blood.' These words were repeated out of doors;\r\nthe witness trembled; the factious also trembled; the factious who\r\nguided the tongue of Truphemy as they had directed his arm, who dictated\r\ncalumny after they had taught him murder. These words penetrated the\r\ndungeons of the condemned, and inspired hope; they gave another\r\ncourageous advocate the resolution to espouse the cause of the\r\npersecuted; he carried the prayers of innocence and misery to the foot\r\nof the throne; there he asked if the evidence of a Truphemy was not\r\nsufficient to annul a sentence. The king granted a full and free\r\npardon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Perjury in the case of General Gilly, &c._\r\n\r\nThis catholic system of subornation and perjury was carried to such an\r\ninfamous degree, that twenty-six witnesses were found to sign and swear,\r\nthat on the 3d of April, 1815, general Gilly, with his own hand and\r\n_before their eyes_, took down the white flag at Nismes; though it was\r\nproved that at the time when the tri-coloured flag was raised in its\r\nroom, the general was fifteen leagues from Nismes, and that he did not\r\narrive there till _three_ days after that event. Before tribunals thus\r\nconstructed, even innocence had not the least chance for protection.\r\nGeneral Gilly knew better than to appear before them, and was condemned\r\nto death for contempt of court. But when he left Nismes, he thought\r\neither of passing into a foreign country, or of joining the army of the\r\nLoire; and it was long supposed that he had actually escaped. As it was\r\nimpossible to gain any point, or find any security, his only hope was in\r\nconcealment, and a friend found him an asylum in the cottage of a\r\npeasant; but that peasant was a protestant, and the general was a\r\ncatholic: however, he did not hesitate; he confided in this poor man's\r\nhonour. This cottage was in the canton of Anduze; the name of its\r\nkeeper, Perrier; he welcomed the fugitive, and did not even ask his\r\nname: it was a time of proscription, and his host would know nothing of\r\nhim, it was enough that he was unfortunate, and in danger. He was\r\ndisguised and he passed for Perrier's cousin. The general is naturally\r\namiable, and he made himself agreeable, sat by the fire, ate potatoes,\r\nand contented himself with miserable fare. Though subject to frequent\r\nand many painful alarms, he preserved his retreat several months, and\r\noften heard the visiters of his host boast of the concealment of general\r\nGilly, or of being acquainted with the place of his retreat. Patrols\r\nwere continually searching for arms in the houses of protestants; and\r\noften in the night the general was obliged to leave his mattress, half\r\nnaked, and hide himself in the fields. Perrier, to avoid these\r\ninconveniences, made an under-ground passage, by which his guest could\r\npass to an outhouse. The wife of Perrier could not endure that one who\r\nhad seen better days should live as her family did, on vegetables and\r\nbread, and occasionally bought meat to regale the melancholy stranger.\r\nThese unusual purchases excited attention; it was suspected that Perrier\r\nhad some one concealed; nightly visits were more frequent. In this state\r\nof anxiety he often complained of the hardness of his lot. Perrier one\r\nday returned from market in a serious mood; and after some inquiries\r\nfrom his guest, he replied, \"Why do you complain? you are fortunate\r\ncompared with the poor wretches whose heads were cried in the market\r\nto-day. Bruguier, the pastor, at 2400 francs; Bresse, the mayor, at the\r\nsame, and general Gilly at 10,000!\"--\"Is it possible?\" \"Aye, it is\r\ncertain.\" Gilly concealed his emotion, a momentary suspicion passed his\r\nmind; he appeared to reflect. \"Perrier,\" said he, \"I am weary of life;\r\nyou are poor and want money: I know Gilly and the place of his\r\nconcealment; let us denounce him; I shall, no doubt, obtain my liberty,\r\nand you shall have the 10,000 francs.\" The old man stood speechless, and\r\nas if petrified. His son, a gigantic peasant, 27 years of age, who had\r\nserved in the army, rose from his chair, in which he had listened to the\r\nconversation, and in a tone not to be described, said, \"Sir, hitherto we\r\nthought you unfortunate, but honest; we have respected your sorrow, and\r\nkept your secret; but since you are one of those wretched beings who\r\nwould inform of a fellow creature, and insure his death to save\r\nyourself, there is the door; and if you do not retire, I will throw you\r\nout of the window.\" Gilly hesitated; the peasant insisted; the general\r\nwished to explain, but he was seized by the collar. \"Suppose I should be\r\ngeneral Gilly,\" said the fugitive. The soldier paused. \"And it is even\r\nso,\" continued he, \"denounce me, and the 10,000 francs are yours.\" The\r\nsoldier threw himself on his neck; the family were dissolved in tears;\r\nthey kissed his hands, his clothes, protested they would never let him\r\nleave them, and that they would die rather than he should be arrested.\r\nIn their kindness he was more secure than ever; but their cottage was\r\nmore suspected, and he was ultimately obliged to seek another asylum.\r\nThe family refused any indemnity for the expense he had occasioned them,\r\nand it was not till long after that he could prevail upon them to accept\r\nan acknowledgement of their hospitality and fidelity. In 1820, when the\r\ncourse of justice was more free, general Gilly demanded a trial; there\r\nwas nothing against him; and the duke d'Angouleme conveyed to Madame\r\nGilly the permission of the king for the return of her husband to the\r\nbosom of his country.\r\n\r\nBut, even when the French government was resolved to bring the factions\r\nof the department of the Gard, under the laws, the same men continued to\r\nexercise the public functions. The society, called _Royale_, and its\r\nsecret committee, maintained a power superior to the laws. It was\r\nimpossible to procure the condemnation of an assassin though the\r\nevidence against him was incontestible, and for whom, in other times,\r\nthere would have been no hope. The Truphemys, and others of his stamp,\r\nappeared in public, wearing immense mustachios, and white cockades\r\nembroidered with green. Like the brigands of Calabria, they had two\r\npistols and a poignard at their waists. Their appearance diffused an air\r\nof melancholy mixed with indignation. Even amidst the bustle of the day\r\nthere was the silence of fear, and the night was disturbed by atrocious\r\nsongs, or vociferations like the sudden cry of ferocious wild beasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ultimate resolution of the Protestants at Nismes._\r\n\r\nWith respect to the conduct of the protestants, these highly outraged\r\ncitizens, pushed to extremities by their persecutors, felt at length\r\nthat they had only to choose the manner in which they were to perish.\r\nThey unanimously determined that they would die fighting in their own\r\ndefence. This firm attitude apprised their butchers that they could no\r\nlonger murder with impunity. Every thing was immediately changed. Those,\r\nwho for four years had filled others with terror, now felt it in their\r\nturn. They trembled at the force which men, so long resigned, found in\r\ndespair, and their alarm was heightened when they heard that the\r\ninhabitants of the Cavennes, persuaded of the danger of their brethren,\r\nwere marching to their assistance. But, without waiting for these\r\nreinforcements, the protestants appeared at night in the same order and\r\narmed in the same manner as their enemies. The others paraded the\r\nBoulevards, with their usual noise and fury, but the protestants\r\nremained silent and firm in the posts they had chosen. Three days these\r\ndangerous and ominous meetings continued; but the effusion of blood was\r\nprevented by the efforts of some worthy citizens distinguished by their\r\nrank and fortune. By sharing the dangers of the protestant population,\r\nthey obtained the pardon of an enemy who now trembled while he menaced.\r\n\r\nBut though the protestants were modest in their demands, only asking\r\npresent safety, and security for the future, they did not obtain above\r\nhalf of their requests. The dissolution of the National Guard at Nismes\r\nwas owing to the prudence and firmness of M. Laine. The re-organization\r\nof the _Cour Royale_ was effected by M. Pasquier, then Keeper of the\r\nSeals; and these measures certainly ensured them a present safety but no\r\nmore. M. Madier de Montgau, the generous champion of the protestants at\r\nNismes, was officially summoned before the Court of Cassation at Paris,\r\nover which M. de Serre, Keeper of the Seals, presided, to answer for an\r\nalleged impropriety of conduct as a magistrate, in making those public\r\nappeals to the Chamber which saved the protestants, and increased the\r\ndifficulties of renewing those persecutions of which he complained. The\r\nFrench attorney general demanded the erasure of his name from the list\r\nof magistrates, but this the court refused. Unfortunately since the law\r\nof elections in France has been changed, two of the bitterest enemies of\r\nthe protestants had been chosen Deputies at Nismes. The future,\r\ntherefore, is not without its dangers, and the condition of the\r\npersecuted may fluctuate with the slightest political alteration; but\r\nwhich, it is to be hoped, may be prevented from any acts that may again\r\ndisgrace the catholic religion, by the powerful expression of the public\r\nmind, actuated with better principles, or by the interference of the\r\nprotestant influence in this or other countries. Happily, since the year\r\n1820, no fresh complaints have issued from the south of France on the\r\nscore of religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nASAAD SHIDIAK.\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF THE CONVERSION, IMPRISONMENT, AND SUFFERINGS OF ASAAD\r\nSHIDIAK, A NATIVE OF PALESTINE, WHO HAS BEEN CONFINED FOR SEVERAL YEARS\r\nIN THE CONVENT OF MT. LEBANON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following narrative illustrates two points. 1st. The usefulness of\r\nChristian Missions. 2d. The unchanging persecuting spirit of the papal\r\nchurch. The subject of the following narrative has now been in\r\nconfinement about five years; during which time he has suffered almost\r\nevery indignity and vexation which the malice of his enemies could\r\nimpose upon him. Up to the present time, however, he has remained\r\nsteadfast in his adherence to the principles of the gospel. We give the\r\nnarrative of his trials and sufferings in the simple and affecting\r\nlanguage of the missionaries, which excited such powerful interest in\r\nthe bosoms of Christians, at the time of its first publication. The\r\nprincipal facts are taken from the Missionary Herald published by the\r\nAmerican Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Biographical Notices of Asaad Shidiak._\r\n\r\nThe following account of the remarkable convert from the Maronite Roman\r\nCatholic church, whose name has, of late, appeared frequently on the\r\npages of the Missionary Herald, is compiled chiefly from the journal of\r\nMr. Bird, American Missionary in Syria. The other matter which is\r\ninserted, is derived from authentic sources, and is designed to\r\nconnect, or to illustrate the extracts from the journal, or to render\r\nthe biography more complete and satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_His early History._\r\n\r\nAsaad Shidiak was born in the district north of Beyroot, called Kesruan,\r\nwhere, and at Hadet, a small village five miles south-east of Beyroot,\r\nhis family have ever since lived. This family now consists of the\r\nwidowed mother, five sons, (of whom Asaad is the third) and two or three\r\ndaughters. At about the age of 16, he entered the college of Ain Warka,\r\nand spent a year and a half in studying grammar, (Arabic and Syriac,)\r\nlogic and theology. After this he passed two years teaching theology to\r\nthe monks of a convent near Hadet.\r\n\r\nHe has also been some considerable time scribe to the bishop of Beyroot,\r\nand to the patriarch, the latter of whom was a teacher in the college\r\nwhen Asaad was a student. During the late rebellion, headed by the shekh\r\nBesir, a mere complimentary letter of Asaad's to one of the disaffected\r\nparty, being intercepted, and shown to the emir Beshir, his suspicion\r\nwas excited, and he wrote immediately to the patriarch, in whose employ\r\nhe then was, to dismiss him from his service. The letter of Asaad was\r\nproduced, and though it was seen to contain nothing exceptionable, the\r\npatriarch thought proper to dismiss him without ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Connexion with Mr. King._\r\n\r\nThe dispensations of Providence often seem afflictive when they happen,\r\nand most kind and benevolent afterwards, when their design is perceived.\r\nSo it was in the case of Asaad. Being thus cast out upon the world, by\r\nthose who ought to have befriended him, he applied to Mr. King for\r\nemployment as his instructer in Syriac, and was accepted. Though a young\r\nman, Mr. King pronounced him to be one of the most intelligent natives\r\nof the country, whom he had met with on Mount Lebanon. From morning\r\nuntil night, for several weeks, they were together, and hours were spent\r\nby them, almost every day, in discussing religious subjects, and upon a\r\nmind so candid, so shrewd, so powerful in its conceptions, and so\r\ncomprehensive in its surveys, as that of Asaad, an impression favorable\r\nto protestant christianity could not but be made.\r\n\r\nHaving completed his engagements with Mr. King, he, at the\r\nrecommendation of Mr. Fisk, set up a school in Beyroot, for teaching\r\nArabic grammatically, but soon found himself obliged to relinquish it,\r\nat the command of his patriarch. He was also forbidden, as is stated by\r\nMr. Bird, to give any further instruction to the _Bible-men_, as the\r\nmissionaries are called, because the patriarch \"had received fresh\r\ninstructions from Rome to _persecute_ these men _by every means in his\r\npower_, so long as one of them should remain in the country.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. King was about to leave Syria, he wrote the farewell letter to\r\nhis friends in that country. The letter was designed, by the writer, to\r\nshow the reasons which prevented his becoming a member of the Roman\r\ncatholic church. This letter Asaad attempted to answer but his answer,\r\nso far from being satisfactory to himself, was the occasion of raising\r\nstrong doubts in his mind, as to the general correctness of the Romish\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Connexion with Mr. Bird._\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these doubts, which seem to have distressed him\r\ngreatly, he entered the service of Mr. Bird as his instructer in Arabic.\r\nHis doubts continued to increase; for he now began in earnest the study\r\nof the Bible and of his own heart, and made constant progress in the\r\nknowledge of both. At length he became a protestant in faith, and, as\r\nthere is reason to believe, a truly pious man. Immediately he commenced\r\nreformer; and though young, his matured judgment, his vigorous\r\nintellect, his intrepidity, and his acquisitions, great for his age and\r\nhis nation, soon drew towards him the general attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Visits his Relations._\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of November, 1825,--says Mr. Bird--Shidiak received a letter\r\nfrom the patriarch, in which he threatens him, with his brother Tannoos\r\nand another Maronite youth, with immediate excommunication, unless they\r\ncease from all connexion with the Bible-men.\r\n\r\n15. After mature deliberation it was thought advisable, for the present,\r\nthat he should go home to his friends in Hadet, until the fever of alarm\r\nand opposition should subside a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n_His return to Mr. Bird._\r\n\r\n_Dec. 12._ Shidiak returned, after nearly a month's absence, to continue\r\nwith me for a year, risking whatever obloquy and violence might come\r\nupon him. He has just been obliged to give up an advantageous contract\r\nof marriage, into which he had some months ago entered, because, since\r\nsuspicions were afloat that he is heretical in his notions, the father\r\nof the girl required him to bring a letter from the patriarch,\r\nspecifying what office he would give him. He now gives up all intentions\r\nof marriage. For his greater security, I am to procure for him the usual\r\nwritten protection of the English consul, which shall insure to him,\r\nwhile in my immediate employ, all the safety and liberty of an English\r\nresident.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Progress of His Opinions._\r\n\r\n13. Spent most of the day in conversation with Asaad on the subject of\r\nreligion. He had lately been much in company with the emir Sulman, and\r\nobserved, that his prejudices against christianity were evidently much\r\nsoftened.\r\n\r\n14. Conversed with Asaad on the books of the Apocrypha.[E] He seemed\r\nsatisfied with the proofs that they were not given by inspiration of\r\nGod. He is now searching the scriptures with such an intensity of\r\ninterest, as to leave him neither time nor relish for any thing else.\r\n\r\nWe have a copy of the Arabic bible, printed at Rome, at the end of which\r\nis an appendix which he has discovered to contain a copious list of\r\npopish doctrines, with their appropriate references to scripture proofs.\r\nThese proofs he has found so weak, that he expresses his astonishment\r\nhow such doctrines could be inferred from them; and nothing has occurred\r\nof late, which has more strengthened his conviction that the church of\r\nRome is radically wrong. What seems to have affected him most sensibly,\r\nis, the expression he has found, \"We are under obligation to kill\r\nheretics.\"--Proof,--'False prophets God commanded to be slain. Jehu and\r\nElijah killed the worshippers and prophets of Baal.' This passage he\r\nshows to all who visit him, priests and people, and calls upon them to\r\njudge whether such sweeping destruction is according to the spirit of\r\nthe gospel.\r\n\r\nIn this country, where the pope cannot do all he could wish, the right\r\nof murdering every one who differs from him, has not been so publicly\r\nasserted of late, and some, when they hear it, are a little startled.\r\nBut most of the good children of \"the church\" are soon quieted again, by\r\nthe recollection, that their kind and compassionate \"mother\" _means_\r\nwell, even in murder. The common mode of reasoning, is, in this case,\r\ninverted. It is not said, \"the action is right, therefore the church\r\ndoes it;\" but, \"the church does it, therefore it is right.\"\r\n\r\n_Jan. 1, 1826._ Twelve or fourteen individuals were present at the\r\nArabic service at Mr. Goodell's. After this service, we questioned Asaad\r\nclosely with regard to the state of his heart, and were rather\r\ndisappointed at the readiness, with which he replied, that he thought he\r\nwas born again. For ourselves, we chose rather to suspend our opinion.\r\nHe can hardly be supposed to have acquired yet, even _speculatively_,\r\nvery clear notions of what is regeneration; and it would seem quite as\r\nconsistent with christian humility, and with a true knowledge of his\r\nsinfulness, if he should speak of himself with more doubt and caution.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, an acquaintance of his, one who has heretofore expressed\r\ngreat friendship to him, and to us; who had said that there was no true\r\nreligion to be found in the whole country, and pretended to lament very\r\nmuch that the patriarch and priests had so much sway; came to give Asaad\r\na last serious admonition.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said he, \"is the last time I intend ever to say a word to you on\r\nthe subject of religion. I wish, therefore, before you go any further,\r\nthat you would pause and think whether you can meet all the reproach of\r\nthe world, and all the opposition of the patriarch and priests.\"\r\n\r\nAsaad replied, that he had made up his mind to meet all these things.\r\n\"And now,\" said he, \"if, as you say, you intend never to hold any more\r\nconversation with me on the subject of religion, I have one request to\r\nmake of you, and that is, that you will go, and make the subject of\r\nreligion a matter of serious prayer and inquiry, and see where the path\r\nof life is; I then leave you with your conscience and with God.\"\r\n\r\nAfter relating the substance of this conversation to us, Asaad remarked,\r\nthat these people reminded him of the late patriarch such an one, who\r\nhad a moderate share of understanding, but was ambitious to appear very\r\nwell. This patriarch had a bishop who was really an acute and learned\r\nman, and whose opinions were always received with the greatest deference\r\non all matters relative to religion. The bishop being on a visit one day\r\nat the patriarch's, the latter called him to his presence, and proposed\r\nto him the interpretation of a passage of scripture. The bishop gave the\r\nexplanation according to the best of his judgment. \"No,\" said his\r\nholiness, \"that is not the meaning of the passage;\" and proposed to have\r\na second. When the bishop had again given his opinions and reasons, the\r\npatriarch answered as before, \"That is not the meaning of the passage.\"\r\nIn a third and fourth case, the bishop was equally unfortunate, all his\r\narguments being swept away by the single sage remark of his holiness,\r\n\"That is not the meaning of the passage.\" At last the bishop, in a fit\r\nof discouragement, said, \"Your holiness has put me upon the solution of\r\na number of questions, in all which, it seems, I have been _wrong_. I\r\nwould now thank your holiness to tell me what is _right_.\" The patriarch\r\nbeing startled at the new ground he was on, changed the conversation.\r\n\"So,\" said Asaad, \"these people can all tell me I am mistaken; but when\r\nI ask them what is _right_, they are silent.\"\r\n\r\nAsaad has often remarked, that he is full of anxiety, and finds no rest\r\nfor the sole of his foot. In many things he sees the Romish church to be\r\nwrong, and in some things he thinks _we_ are so. Our apparent\r\ntranquility of mind, as to our religious views, is a matter of surprise\r\nto him. This evening he conversed on the subject with more than usual\r\nfeeling. \"I seem,\" said he, \"to be alone among men. There is nobody like\r\nme, and I please nobody. I am not quite in harmony with the English in\r\nmy views, and therefore do not please _you_. My own countrymen are in so\r\nmuch error, I cannot please _them_. _God_ I have no reason to think I\r\nplease; nor do I please _myself_. What shall I do?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not altogether unpleasant to hear these professions of diffidence\r\nin himself, and I endeavoured to turn off his attention from all other\r\nsources of consolation than that of the \"Comforter, which is the Holy\r\nGhost.\"\r\n\r\nAsaad observed, that whatever might be said, and whatever might be true,\r\nof our _object_, in coming to this country he saw that the _doctrines_\r\nwe taught were according to truth, and he was more than ever determined\r\nto hold to them.\r\n\r\nAsaad says, that wherever he goes, and to whomsoever he addresses\r\nhimself on the subject of religion, people say, \"Ah, it is very well for\r\nyou to go about and talk in this manner: you have, no doubt, been well\r\npaid for it all.\" These insinuations wear upon his spirit, and he\r\nsometimes says, \"O that I were in some distant land, where nobody had\r\never known me, and I knew nobody, that I might be able to fasten men's\r\nattention to the truth, without the possibility of their flying off to\r\nthese horrid suspicions.\"\r\n\r\nHe wishes also to have another interview with the patriarch, that he may\r\ntell him his whole heart, and see what he will say. The patriarch is\r\nnot, he says, of a bad disposition by nature, and perhaps if he could be\r\npersuaded that he was neither acting from revenge nor from love of\r\nmoney, but simply from a conviction of the truth, he would be softened\r\nin his feelings, and something might be done with him to the benefit of\r\nreligion. He desired, among other things, to propose, that an edition of\r\nthe New Testament should be printed under the patriarch's inspection at\r\nSchooair, the expense of which, (if he chose) should be borne by the\r\nEnglish.[F]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Visits the Patriarch._\r\n\r\n6. For some time, we had been looking daily for a regular\r\nexcommunication to be published by the patriarch's order against Asaad;\r\nbut instead of this, a letter arrived from his holiness to-day, brought\r\nby his own brother, priest Nicholas, containing his apostolic blessing,\r\ninviting him to an interview, and promising him a situation in some\r\noffice. The messenger said, that the patriarch, his brother, had heard\r\nthat the English had given Asaad 40 purses, (2000 dollars) to unite him\r\nwith them, and that he had thought of giving Asaad the same sum, that no\r\nobstacle might remain to his leaving them. \"This money,\" said he, \"with\r\nwhich the English print books, and hire men into their service is but\r\nthe pelf of the man of sin, and could you but be present to hear what\r\nthe people say of you, through the whole country, for your associating\r\nwith the English, you would never be in their company again.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we were informed of what occurred between this priest and Asaad,\r\nand of Asaad's intention to go and see the patriarch, we all expressed\r\nour fears that he would be ill-treated, but he did not anticipate it. He\r\nsaid, he had known an instance of a vile infidel and blasphemer, who was\r\nsimply excommunicated, and that it was not the custom of the Maronites\r\nto kill, as we suggested, on account of religion. We assured him that he\r\nhad not yet learned how much men hate the truth, and that his church\r\nwould not feel herself half as much in danger from an open blasphemer,\r\nas from an active lover of the gospel. But he was so confident that\r\ngood would result from such a visit, that we ceased from urging our\r\nobjections, and commended him to the will of God.\r\n\r\nIt was during this visit, that most of the conversations happened which\r\nare so admirably narrated in the public statement made by himself, which\r\nwill be found in the sequel. He manifested throughout, as the reader\r\nwill discover, the spirit of the early christian confessors. He denied\r\nthe infallibility of popes and councils; asserted and defended the great\r\ndoctrines of the gospel, and besought, that the scriptures might be\r\ncirculated, and read, and be made the only standard of faith, and rule\r\nof practice, and that evangelists might be sent through the land.\r\n\r\nAgainst such a formidable innovator, the patriarch and his bishops rose\r\nup in wrath, and Asaad was threatened with imprisonment and death.\r\n\r\nTwo days after his departure, he thus wrote to Mr. Bird.\r\n\r\n\"I am now at Der Alma, (convent of Alma,) and thanks to God, I arrived\r\nin good health. But as yet I have not seen the patriarch. I pray God the\r\nFather, and his only Son Jesus Christ our Lord, that he would establish\r\nme in his love, that I may never exchange it for any created thing--that\r\nneither death, nor life, nor things present, nor things to come, nor\r\nheight, nor depth, nor riches, nor honour, nor dignity, nor office, nor\r\nany thing in creation, shall separate me from this love. I hope you will\r\npray to God for me; which request I also make to all the brethren and\r\nsisters, (all the saints,) after giving them, especially Mr. Goodell,\r\nabundant salutations.\"\r\n\r\n24. Heard that Asaad had been sent to the Armenian convent Bzumar, to\r\nconfess, and that he would probably be sent to Aleppo as a priest.\r\nAnother said, he was seen at the college of Ain Warka.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Is forcibly detained._\r\n\r\n_Feb. 22._ Fearing for the safety of Asaad, since hearing that he has\r\nnot written to his friends, we this morning sent a messenger with a\r\nshort note, to find him, and ascertain his state.\r\n\r\n23. The messenger returned, saying, that he yesterday went to the\r\nvillage, where he understood the patriarch was, and found that he had\r\njust gone with a train of twenty men, and Asaad in company, to Der Alma.\r\nIn the morning, he rose, went to that convent, and chanced to find Asaad\r\nalone. After some conversation, in which they were providentially not\r\ninterrupted, Asaad handed him a hasty line, and he returned. The line\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Much respected brother,--Your note has reached me, and has added\r\nanother proof to the many I have had already, of your kind regard to me.\r\nI now beseech you once more, to pray for me, that I may be delivered\r\nfrom the dark devices of men. I find myself reduced to quite an\r\nextremity. One or more of three things are before me; either to be\r\nthought mad, or to commit sin, or to offer up my life I call upon God\r\nfor deliverance. I cannot now write fully, but the bearer will tell you\r\nof all.\"\r\n\r\nThe messenger said, that the emir of that district had threatened to\r\nsend him to Bteddeen, to be imprisoned. Asaad replied, that he was ready\r\nto go to prison and to death. He was engaged in daily disputations with\r\nthe patriarch and others. His countenance wore a shade of melancholy,\r\nand his eyes were red with weeping.\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed by the messenger to interfere with English\r\nauthority for his rescue, he said such a course might exasperate his\r\nenemies, and cost him his life: it would be better to wait a while, and\r\nleave it for Providence to open a way for his escape.\r\n\r\nThis assurance of his steadfastness was like a cordial to our spirits,\r\nand was not without a good influence on some that are about us. By the\r\ngrace of God, he will witness a good confession before the dignitaries\r\nboth of church and state, and by the same grace, he may open the eyes of\r\nsome of them to the truth as it is in Jesus. To him that was with Daniel\r\nand with the three children in their dangers, we commend him.\r\n\r\n24. Called on the consul to inquire what could be done for the\r\nprotection or relief of Asaad. He recommended a course of moderation and\r\nforbearance, and said it was not customary to extend English protection\r\nto natives, when abroad on their own business.\r\n\r\n26. Two young emirs from Hadet called. I asked one of them \"Where is\r\nAsaad Shidiak at present?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"He is with the patriarch.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is he contented there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very well contented. But what should he do, poor fellow, necessity\r\nis laid upon him.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark proves to us, that it is not a secret among the priests and\r\nemirs, that Asaad is detained against his will.\r\n\r\n_March 1._ A youth called this morning, and said Asaad Shidiak sent me\r\nsalutation. He showed me a line he had received from Asaad the day\r\nbefore, saying, \"If you will pass this way about midnight, I will go\r\nwith you to Beyroot.\" Owing to some circumstance, the young man did not\r\ngo to the convent, and now he proposed to take a horse, by which Asaad\r\nmay escape to-night.\r\n\r\nAs we had not perfect confidence in the youth, we did nothing, but\r\nhaving ascertained his plan, left him to go on as he chose. In the\r\nevening, we had a season of prayer, particularly on his account.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Escapes and returns to Beyroot._\r\n\r\n2. Rose early, and repaired to the room, where Asaad would have been,\r\nhad he come; but there were no tidings from him. Little expectation\r\nremained of his coming to-day, and we were not without our fears that\r\nthe attempt had miscarried. It was not long, however, before it was\r\nannounced, that Asaad was at the door.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was one of great joy and thanksgiving to us all.--After a\r\nlittle rest and refreshment, he gave us a brief account of his escape.\r\n\r\nHe had not seen the youth, who had undertaken to befriend him, but\r\nfinding he did not call the night before, as he expected, he resolved\r\nnot to wait another day. Therefore, at about twelve o'clock last night,\r\nhaving written a paper and left it on his bed, with the quotation, \"Come\r\nout of her my people,\" &c. he set off on foot, committing himself to God\r\nfor strength and protection. The darkness was such, that he often found\r\nhimself out of his road, sometimes miring in mud, and sometimes wading\r\nin rivers. After some hours of weariness and anxiety, he came to the\r\nshore of the sea, where he found a large boat thrown up, under which he\r\ncast himself, and obtained a little rest. After this, he continued his\r\nwalk without interruption, till he reached Beyroot.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the forenoon, a messenger came from the neighbouring\r\nshekh, or sheriff, requesting Asaad to come and see him; adding, that if\r\nhe did not come, he would watch an opportunity to take his life. The\r\nmessenger came a second time, and returned without accomplishing his\r\nobject. We afterwards wrote a line to the shekh to say, that if he would\r\nfavour us with a call in person and take a cup of coffee, he could have\r\nthe privilege of an interview with Asaad. Just as the note was sent, the\r\nconsul providentially came in, and the shekh found him ready to give him\r\na seasonable reprimand for presuming to threaten a person under English\r\nprotection. The shekh declared, that he had never sent such a message;\r\nthat the man who brought it was but an ass, and said it from his own\r\nbrain; that having heard of Asaad's arrival, he merely wished to see\r\nwhether the reports respecting his insanity were true or false; that\r\nAsaad was his bosom friend, his own son, and that whatever he had was\r\nhis; and that as for church, and priests, and patriarch, he cared for\r\nnone of them.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, the youth already mentioned entered the house, ready to\r\nfaint with excessive fear and fatigue. He had fled from the mountains in\r\nall haste, under the absurd apprehension, that he should be suspected\r\nand taken up as an accomplice with Asaad. Having thrown himself upon a\r\nseat, and taken a little breath, he began to relate what had happened.\r\nHe was at the convent, when it was first discovered that Asaad had fled.\r\nThe patriarch and his train were occupied in the religious services of\r\nthe morning, so that no great sensation was at first apparent among\r\nthem. One individual spoke boldly in favour of Asaad, saying, \"Why\r\nshould he not leave you? What inducement had he to remain here? What had\r\nhe here to do? What had he to enjoy? Books he had none; friendly society\r\nnone; conversation against religion abundant; insults upon his opinions\r\nand his feelings abundant. Why should he not leave you?\"\r\n\r\nOthers, especially the great ones, pitied the poor maniac, (as they\r\ncalled him,) and sent in quest of him to every direction, lest\r\nperadventure, he might be found starving in some cavern, or floating in\r\nthe sea, or dashed in pieces at the bottom of a precipice.\r\n\r\nOn learning of Asaad all that had passed during his absence, we\r\nrequested him to write a statement of the facts somewhat in the form of\r\na journal. We wished this not only for our own information, but to\r\nproduce it to those who shall inquire on the subject of Asaad's lunacy\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Public Statement of Asaad Shidiak._\r\n\r\n        _Beyroot, March 1826._\r\n\r\nRespected Brethren and Friends,--Since many have heard a report, that I\r\nhave become insane; and others, that I have become a heretic; I have\r\nwished to write an account of myself in few words, and then let every\r\nreflecting man judge for himself, whether I am mad, or am slandered;\r\nwhether following after heresy, or after the truth of the orthodox\r\nfaith. Every serious man of understanding will concede, that true\r\nreligion is not that of compulsion, nor that which may be bought and\r\nsold; but that which proceeds from attending to the word of God,\r\nbelieving it, and endeavouring to walk according to it to the glory of\r\nGod, and that every one, whose object is solely contention, and who does\r\nnot obey the truth, but follows after unrighteousness, is far distant\r\nfrom the true religion. This is the standard, by which I would be judged\r\nby every one who reads this narrative.\r\n\r\nAbout eight or nine months ago, I was employed, by an American by the\r\nname of J. King, in teaching him the Syriac language. At that time, I\r\nwas very fond of engaging with him in disputatious conversations, to\r\nprove him to be in error; but with none but worldly motives, to display\r\nmy talents and knowledge, and acquire the praise of men. After this, I\r\napplied myself to reading of the word of God with intense interest. Now\r\nthis person wrote a farewell letter to his friends, in which he excuses\r\nhimself from uniting himself with the Roman Catholic church. After\r\nreading this letter, I found, in the Holy scriptures, many passages,\r\nwhich made against the opinions of the writer. These passages I\r\nselected, and from them and other evidences, composed a reply to him.\r\nBut when I was copying the first rough draught of the same, and had\r\narrived to the answer to the last of the objections, which he said\r\nprevented his becoming a member of the Roman Catholic church, viz: that\r\nthe Roman Catholic church teaches, that it is wrong for the common\r\npeople to possess or read the word of God but that they ought to learn\r\nfrom the popes and councils, I observed the writer brings a proof\r\nagainst the doctrine from the prophet Isaiah, viz: \"To the law and to\r\nthe testimony, if they speak not according to my word, it is because\r\nthere is no light in them.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I was endeavouring to explain this passage also, according to the\r\nviews of the Roman Catholic church, with no other object than the praise\r\nof men, and other worldly motives, I chanced to read the 29th chapter\r\nof Isaiah, from the 15th verse to the end. I read, and was afraid. I\r\nmeditated upon the chapter a long while, and feared that I was doing\r\nwhat I did, with a motive far different from the only proper one, viz.\r\nthe glory and the pleasure of God. I therefore threw by my paper without\r\nfinishing the copy, and applied myself diligently to the reading of the\r\nprophecy of Isaiah. I had wished to find, in the prophets, plain proofs,\r\nby which to establish, beyond contradiction, that Jesus Christ is the\r\nMessiah, so long expected from ancient days; proofs that might be made\r\nuse of in answer to Moslems and Jews. While I was thus searching, I\r\nfound various passages, that would _bear_ an explanation according to my\r\nviews, but did not find them sufficient to enforce conviction on others,\r\nuntil I finally came to the 52d chapter 14th verse, and onward to the\r\nend of the next chapter.\r\n\r\nOn finding this testimony, my heart rejoiced, and was exceeding glad,\r\nfor it removed many dark doubts from my _own_ mind also. From that time,\r\nmy desire to read the New Testament, that I might discover the best\r\nmeans of acting according to the doctrines of Jesus, was greatly\r\nincreased. I endeavoured to divest myself of all selfish bias, and loved\r\nmore and more to inquire into religious subjects. I saw, and continue to\r\nsee, many of the doctrines of the Roman Catholic church, which I could\r\nnot believe, and which I found opposed to the truths of the Gospel; and\r\nI wished much to find some of her best teachers to explain them to me,\r\nthat I might see how they proved them from the Holy scriptures. As I was\r\nreading an appendix to a copy of the sacred scriptures, printed at Rome\r\nby the Propaganda, and searching out the passages referred to, for\r\nproving the duty of worshipping saints, and other similar doctrines, I\r\nfound that these proofs failed altogether of establishing the points in\r\nquestion, and that to infer such doctrines from such premises, was even\r\nworthy of ridicule. Among other things, in this appendix, I found the\r\nvery horrible _Neronian_ doctrines, _that it is our duty to destroy\r\nheretics_. Now every one knows, that whoever does not believe that the\r\npope is infallible, is a heretic in his opinions.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is not merely that it is _allowable_ to kill heretics, but\r\nthat we are _bound_ to do it. From this I was the more established in my\r\nconvictions against the doctrines of the pope, and saw that they were\r\nthe doctrines of the ravenous beast, and not of the gentle lamb. After I\r\nhad read this, I asked one of the priests in Beyroot respecting this\r\ndoctrine, and he assured me, that it was even so as I had read. I then\r\nwished to go to some place, though it might be a distant country, that I\r\nmight find some man of the Roman Catholic church sufficiently learned to\r\nprove the doctrine above alluded to.\r\n\r\nAfter this, as I was at Beyroot teaching a few Greek youths the Arabic\r\ngrammar, I received a letter from his holiness the Maronite patriarch,\r\nsaying, that if I did not cease from all assistance whatever to the\r\nEnglish, and that if I did not leave them within one day, I should,\r\n_ipso facto_, fall under the heaviest excommunication.\r\n\r\nThinking, as I did, that obeying my superiors, in all things not\r\nsinful, was well and good, I did not delay to leave, and so went to my\r\nfriends at Hadet; but still thinking very much on the subject of\r\nreligion, so that some people thought me melancholy. I loved exceedingly\r\nto converse on religious subjects, indeed I took no pleasure in any\r\nworldly concerns, and found all worldly possessions vain. After this, I\r\nreceived a second letter from his holiness the patriarch, in which he\r\nsaid thus: \"After we had written you the first letter, we wrote you a\r\nsecond; see that you act according to it. And if you fulfil all that was\r\ncommanded in it, and come up to us when we come to Kesran, we will\r\nprovide you a situation.\" But I saw that nothing, in which I was\r\naccustomed to take delight, pleased me any longer. I returned again,\r\nafter some time, to Beyroot; and after I had been there no long time,\r\nHoory Nicolas arrived, brother to his holiness the rev. patriarch, with\r\na request from the latter, to come and see him, which I hastened to do.\r\nHoory Nicolas then began to converse with me, in the way of reprimand,\r\nfor being in connexion with the English. I replied that, as we ought not\r\nto deny the unity of God, because the Musselmans believe it, so we ought\r\nnot to hate the gospel because the English love it. He then began to\r\ntell me of the wish of his holiness, the rev. patriarch, that I should\r\ncome out to him, and of his great love to me; and said that he (the\r\npatriarch) had heard, that I had received thirty or forty purses of\r\nmoney from the English; and he assured me of their readiness not to\r\nsuffer this to be any hindrance to my coming out from them.\r\n\r\nNow if my object were money, as some seemed to think, I had then a fair\r\nopportunity to tell him a falsehood, and say, \"I indeed received from\r\nthe English that sum, but I have expended so and so, and cannot leave\r\nthem unless I restore the whole.\" In this way I might have contrived to\r\ntake what I wished. Yet I did not so answer him, but declared to him the\r\ntruth, how much wages I had received, and which was nothing\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nHe then gave me a paper from his holiness the patriarch, in which he\r\nsays, \"You will have received from us an answer, requesting that when we\r\ncome to Alma, you will come up and see us. We expect your presence, and,\r\nif God please, we will provide you some proper situation, with an income\r\nthat shall be sufficient for your sustenance. Delay not your coming,\r\nlest the present happy opportunity should pass by.\" Knowing, as I did,\r\nthat many people supposed my object, in continuing with the English, to\r\nbe gain, I did not delay fulfilling the request of his reverence, hoping\r\nto remove this suspicion, and to enjoy an opportunity of speaking the\r\ntruth without being hired to do it.\r\n\r\nSo, about the 7th of January, I left Beyroot, with Hoory Nicolas, and\r\narrived at Der Alma the same night. His holiness, the patriarch, was not\r\nthere. On the next day, when he came, I met him, and saluted him in the\r\nroad. In the evening he called me into his chamber, and began to ask me\r\nquestions, that he might discover what I was; and I answered him telling\r\nhim the whole truth, although this course was opposed to my personal\r\nconvenience. At this he seemed surprised, for he must have perceived it\r\nwas contrary to what he had been accustomed to see in me. Afterwards,\r\nwhen I declared to him, that I never had before been a believer,\r\naccording to the true living faith, he was probably still more\r\nastonished. He then asked me if I believed as the Romish church\r\nbelieved. I again told him the truth, that I did not. He asked then what\r\nwas my faith, and I answered to the following purport, \"True and living\r\nfaith must be divine, connected with hope, love and repentance, and that\r\nall these virtues are the gift of God &c.; that I believed the truth as\r\nGod had inspired it; and that it would be but a lie, if I should say\r\nthat I believed as the Romish church does, while in fact I do not. I\r\nmust have proofs.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some conversation like this, he told me that this doctrine of mine\r\nwas heretical, and that as long as I remained in this state of opinion,\r\nhe would suffer no one to have intercourse with me in buying and\r\nselling, &c. This prohibition of his brought to my mind the words in the\r\nRevelation, xiii, 17.[G] Then he gave me to understand, that if, after\r\nthree days, I did not get back out of this state, I must no more enter\r\nthe church. At other times, he wished me to swear by the eucharist and\r\nby the gospel, that my faith was like the faith of the Roman catholic\r\nchurch. He asked me if I was a Bible man; I replied, \"I do not follow\r\nthe opinions of the Bible men; but if you think me a Bible man on\r\naccount of the opinions I have advanced, very well.\"\r\n\r\nThe sum of what I said was, that without evidence I could not believe\r\nwhat the Romish church believes. From that time, after three days, I did\r\nnot enter the church for a space. Some time passed again, and the\r\npatriarch inquired of me my faith. I then explained to him what I\r\nbelieved respecting the unity and trinity of God, and that the Messiah\r\nwas one person with two natures, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from\r\nthe Father and Son. Then arose a disputation about, who is the Vicar\r\nthat Christ has appointed to explain his law. I answered in substance as\r\nI afterwards did in writing, that by reason, and learning, and prayer to\r\nGod, with purity of motive, we may know, from the holy scriptures, every\r\nthing necessary to our salvation. This was the purport of my reply,\r\nwhich perhaps was not expressed with sufficient clearness, or perhaps I\r\nwas not able to say it in the manner that was appropriate, for such a\r\ntumult and storm were excited in the company that they seemed to me to\r\nbe intent on overcoming me by dint of vociferation, rather than by\r\nargument, and to drown my voice, rather than to understand my opinions.\r\n\r\nWhen, after some days, came bishop Abdalla Blabul and Padre Bernardus of\r\nGzir, the patriarch one day called me to them in his chamber, and asked\r\nme what I wished, whether money or office, or whatever it might be,\r\npromising to gratify me, speaking of his love to me and of his great\r\ninterest in my welfare. These professions I know to be sincere, but\r\nthey are according to the world, and not according to the Gospel. I\r\nassured him that I wanted nothing of the things he had mentioned; that I\r\nwas submissive and obedient to him; and that if he thought of me, that I\r\nhad taken money of the English, he was welcome to shut me up in my\r\nchamber as to a prison, and take from me every thing that I possessed;\r\nthat I wished from them merely my necessary food and clothing, and that\r\nI would give them this assurance in writing. The bishop and priest then\r\nbegged me, in presence of the patriarch, to say that my faith was like\r\nthat of the Romish church. I replied, that I feared to tell a falsehood\r\nby saying a thing, while actually, in my reason, I did not believe it.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said they, \"the patriarch here will absolve you from the sin of\r\nthe falsehood.\" I turned to the Patriarch and put the question whether\r\nhe would so absolve me. He answered, that he would. I said, \"What the\r\nlaw of nature itself condemns, it is out of the power of any man to make\r\nlawful.\" He then again asked me what I wished to do. I said, I wish to\r\ngo and see the Armenian patriarch Gregory, and inquire of him what I\r\nought to do. He consented, and requested me, when I had done this, to\r\nreturn to him, to which I agreed. I was accompanied by a priest from the\r\nstation of the patriarch to the College of Ain Warka, where I found\r\nHoory Joseph Shaheen, with whom I conversed a considerable time, and\r\nwith great pleasure; for I found that for himself, he did not believe\r\nthat the pope was infallible in matters of faith, that is to say, unless\r\nin concert with the congregated church. I then began to confess to him:\r\nbut when I saw that he held steadfastly some opinions for no other\r\nreason than that the church so believed, and without bringing any proper\r\nevidence of the fact, viz. from councils or from the fathers, and burst\r\nout upon me with exceeding bitter words, saying, \"Know that the church\r\nneither deceives, nor is deceived, and be quiet;\" and when I wished him\r\nto instruct me according to the word of God, with the simple object of\r\nglorifying God and fulfilling his will, I saw that he was not disposed\r\nto support any opinion because it was according to the word of God, but\r\nbecause so thought the church; and I saw him also ready to retain these\r\nopinions, although I should bring the strongest evidences against them\r\nfrom the holy Scriptures. He told me that it was impossible for him to\r\nteach any thing contrary to the council of Trent. So I found I could not\r\nreceive his system, because, though you should shew him that it was\r\nwrong, he would not give it up, lest with it he should be obliged to\r\ngive up his office. I therefore told him, you are bound, i. e. shut up\r\nas between walls, by the doctrines of the pope and the council of Trent.\r\n\r\nIn conversation on the images, he would have proved their propriety from\r\nBaronius' church history. We found this author quoting the sacred\r\nscriptures to prove that our Saviour sent a picture of himself to the\r\nking of Abgar. I declared that it was false, in so far as he stated that\r\nthe _Gospel_ made any such statement, and on that account I could not\r\nbelieve the story. To this he gave me no answer. After this, as we were\r\nreading the book, and found a statement respecting the bishops collected\r\nin Constantinople, to the number of 313; that they decreed the abolition\r\nof the use of images, because it was idolatrous, and that in the\r\nclearest terms,--I asked him the question, \"If an assembly composed of\r\nthe bishops of the church were infallible, how is it that this council\r\nis said to have committed an error?\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time, I heard that a certain individual wished to converse\r\nwith me on the subject of religion, which rejoiced me exceedingly, and I\r\nwas impatient for an interview. He came on a Sabbath day to Ain Warka,\r\nfor the study of the Arabic grammar, according to his custom, and we had\r\na short conversation together on works unlawful on the Sabbath day, and\r\nother subjects. He then excused himself from further conversation for\r\nwant of time; but promised that when we should meet again, he hoped to\r\nhave a sufficient opportunity to dwell on these subjects at large. I\r\ncontinued at Ain Warka the whole week, reading with the rest at prayers\r\nand confessing to Hoory Joseph above mentioned; and on the next Lord's\r\nday, the Armenian priest aforesaid came again, and I fully expected to\r\nhave time and opportunity to ascertain his opinions; but I was\r\ndisappointed again; for he wished to have the dispute carried on in\r\nwriting, and to have an assistant with him, with other conditions.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances I failed of my object; but was on the whole more\r\ninclined than before to receive the doctrines of the Romish church;\r\nsince the priest had promised to bring his evidence, on all points, from\r\nthe word of God, that they (the papists) were walking in light and not\r\nin darkness.\r\n\r\nAt this time one informed me that his holiness, bishop Jacob, superior\r\nof the convent of Bzumar, wished to see me. And because Hoory Joseph, at\r\nfirst told me that this state in which I had fallen was a temptation of\r\nSatan, and at one time shewed me that it was usual for people, when they\r\ncame to the age of manhood, to be tempted on the subject of their\r\nreligion, and at another, assured me, that this was a state of\r\ndelirium:--and again, because I had heard formerly that this bishop\r\nJacob had himself been delirious, and that he was a man of information,\r\nI wished very much to see him; and on the same day I went to Hoory\r\nJoseph and declared to him plainly my opinions, and shewed him that the\r\nbeast mentioned in the Revelation was a figure, as the lamb evidently\r\nwas, and how dreadful must be the torments of those who worship the\r\nimage of the beast. I then disclosed to him my intention of going up to\r\nthe convent of Bzumar, where were the patriarch Gregory, bishop Jacob,\r\nand the Armenian priest already mentioned.\r\n\r\nI set off the same day, and on my arrival saluted the patriarch, and on\r\nthe same night reasoned on the subjects of faith, hope and love. It\r\nappeared that the patriarch's opinion was, that a man may be possessed\r\nof living faith, faith unto salvation, although he should feel nothing\r\nin his heart. I answered him with a quotation from St. Paul, \"With the\r\nheart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is\r\nmade unto salvation.\" But this did not convince him. He explained the\r\n_heart_ to mean the _will_. It then appeared to me that he was not a\r\ntrue believer, and from that time forward I could not believe him, as I\r\nwould believe a real Christian, but I wished to hear his worldly\r\narguments. On the following day, I asked him how it can he said, that\r\nthe pope was infallible if there were no proofs of the fact to be\r\nbrought. I asked him if this pretension of the pope was that of an\r\napostle, or a prophet? if an apostle, or a prophet, he could not be\r\nbelieved without miracles, and that we christians were not to believe\r\nany one, though he were to bring down fire from Heaven.[H] His replies\r\nto me were weak; and after considerable conversation on what is the\r\nchurch of Christ, on the ignorance that is pardonable, &c. he began to\r\nprove that if the pope is not infallible, then there is _no religion_,\r\n_no gospel_, and even _no God_. But I observed all his proofs so weak,\r\nthat I could not be convinced, and I fell into deep perplexity as to\r\nwhat I should do. For sometimes I greatly endeavoured to submit my\r\njudgment to his rules and opinions, and made these efforts until my very\r\nhead would ache. The next day I asked him what was that _great city_,\r\nruling over the kings of the earth, mentioned in the Rev. xvii, 18?\r\nAfter he had brought his book of commentaries, he answered that it was\r\nRome, which is also called spiritual Babylon, or Babel, and after\r\nwishing me to yield to his opinion or that of the book, he said nothing\r\nmore. From this time I was with the patriarch every day for three or\r\nfour hours, and his best advice to me was, to pray to St. Antony of\r\nPadua, together with one repetition of the Lord's prayer, and one of\r\nHail Mary, &c. every day for three days. When I was thus in doubt from\r\nthe weakness of their proofs, one of the monks said to me, \"If you wish\r\nto know _good tobacco_, ask the patriarch.\" I hoped that this priest\r\nwould explain to me those doctrines of the Romish church, which I could\r\nnot believe; so I went into his chamber and questioned him very\r\nparticularly on all points. He expressed his wish that we might discuss\r\ntogether all the points one by one, but on condition that the patriarch\r\nJoseph should appoint him to do so. He told me he had in his possession\r\na book refuting the opinions of Luther and Calvin. I begged permission\r\nto read it; but he refused, telling me that the doctrines of the church\r\nall remained unrefuted. He wished me to go down to the patriarch Joseph\r\non this business. So after a stay of four days from my arrival, I\r\ndeparted for Ain Warka according to my promise to Hoory Joseph.\r\n\r\nHere I found one of my friends of whom I had heard that he had been very\r\nmuch astonished at my connexion with the Bible men. After I had seen\r\nhim, and had conversed with him a little on some points, he would no\r\nlonger hear me, fearing among other things lest he should be crazed.\r\nWhen we touched on the subject of the great city above mentioned, he\r\ntold me that he had seen a book of commentaries on the Revelation, which\r\nmade the city clearly to be Rome. At this I wondered greatly, since the\r\nmeaning was so clear that not even the teachers of the Romish church\r\nherself could deny it. I then finished my confession to Hoory Joseph\r\nShaheen, and about sunset the same day, went down to the patriarch to\r\nthe convent Alma. He requested me again to write a paper stating that my\r\nfaith was according to the faith of the Romish church. From this I\r\nexcused myself, begging that such a thing might not be required of me,\r\nfor the council of Trent had added nothing to the rule of faith, which\r\nwas established by that of Nice, which begins, \"I believe in one God,\"\r\n&c. A short space after, I gave him my advice, with modest arguments,\r\nand mild suggestions, on his duty to cause the gospel to be preached in\r\nthe church among the Maronite people; and offered him the opinion that\r\nthis should be done by the priests in the vulgar language, every Sabbath\r\nday, for the space of one or two hours; and if this should appear too\r\nburthensome to the people, to take off from them some of the feast days.\r\nAfter this, I remained silent in my chamber near to his own; and as\r\nthere came to me a few of the deacons of the patriarch, and others, I\r\nread to them at their request in the New Testament printed in Rome. But\r\nin a little time after, I entered my room, and found in it none of all\r\nthe books that had been there, neither New Testament nor any other, and\r\nI knew that the patriarch had given the order for this purpose, for he\r\nreproved me for reading the gospel to them, but he could accuse me of no\r\nfalse or erroneous explanations, or that I taught them any thing\r\nheretical.\r\n\r\nOne day after this, he called me to his presence and began to threaten\r\nme in a most unusual manner. I said, \"What do you wish of me, your\r\nreverence? What have I done, and what would you have me do? What is my\r\nsin, except that I conversed with some individuals, shewing them the\r\nerrors of the church of Rome?\" Then he requested me again, to say, that\r\nI believed as did that church, and said, grasping me firmly by the chin,\r\n\"see how I will take you if you do not repent.\" I begged him to appoint\r\nsome one to shew me the truth, by way of discussion, but he would not,\r\nand continued expressing his own sentiment, that we are bound to hold\r\nfast to the church, even to such a length, that if she should even\r\nreject the gospel, we should reject it too.\r\n\r\nAnd here I wish to say a word to every reader that regards and loves the\r\ntruth; how does such doctrine appear to you? and how could I believe in\r\nall which the Romish church holds, without _knowing_ all of it? and how\r\ncould I say, without a lie, that I believe, when I do not believe?\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the patriarch breaking out with an exceeding loud and unusual\r\nvoice, I was afraid that I should be found among \"_the fearful_,\" (Rev.\r\nxxi. 8.) and rose to depart. When I reached the door, I turned and said\r\nto him, \"I will hold fast the religion of Jesus Christ, and I am ready\r\nfor the sake of it to shed my blood; and though you should all become\r\ninfidels, yet will not I;\" and so left the room.\r\n\r\nOne of my friends told me, that he had suggested to the patriarch the\r\ngrand reason why I did not believe in the pope, which was, that among\r\nother doctrines of his, he taught, that he could not commit an error,\r\nand that now, though a pope should see any one of his predecessors had\r\nerred, he could not say this, for fear that _he_ also should appear to\r\nbe an unbeliever. This friend also told me, that the patriarch wondered\r\nhow I should pretend that I held to the Christian religion, and still\r\nconverse in such abusive terms against it; and _I_ also wondered, that\r\nafter he saw this, he should not be willing so much as to ask me, in\r\nmildness, and self-possession, and forbearance, _for what reasons_ I was\r\nunwilling to receive the doctrines of the pope, or to say I believed as\r\nhe did; but he would not consent that the above mentioned Armenian\r\npriest should hold a discussion with me, and more than this, laid every\r\nperson, and even his own brother, under excommunication, if he should\r\npresume to dispute or converse with me on the subject of religion.\r\n\r\nUnder this prohibition from conversation, and this bereavement of books,\r\nfrom what quarter could I get the necessary evidence to believe in their\r\nopinion?\r\n\r\nAnother cause I had of wonder, which was, that not one of all with whom\r\nI conversed, after he saw me to be heretical and declining from the\r\ntruth, thought proper to advise me to use the only means of becoming\r\nstrong in the faith, viz. prayer to God the Most High, and searching his\r\nHoly Word, which a child may understand. I wondered, too, that they\r\nshould ridicule me, and report me abroad as one mad and after all this,\r\nbe so fearful to engage in a dispute with the madman, lest he should\r\nvanquish them in argument, or spoil their understandings, or turn them\r\naway from the truth.\r\n\r\nAfter some time came the bishop of Beyroot. I gave him the usual\r\nsalutation, and was greatly rejoiced to see him, as I knew the\r\nexcellency of his understanding, and his quickness of apprehension, and\r\nhoped that, after some discussion between us, he would explain the\r\ntruth, and that he would rest on clear evidence to support his views.\r\nBut in this case also, I was disappointed; for one day, when I asked him\r\na question, and during the whole short conversation which followed,\r\nwhenever I began to bring evidence against him, he was angry, and\r\nfinally drove me from my chamber in a fury, and that with no other\r\ncause, as he pretended, than that he did not wish to converse with a\r\nheretic.\r\n\r\nSome time after this, Hoory Joseph Shaheen came down to the convent of\r\nAlma, and I endeavoured to get him to unite with me in persuading the\r\npatriarch to send out among the people preachers of the gospel, or that\r\nthere should be preaching in the churches as before mentioned. But he\r\nwould not co-operate with me in this, and I was again disappointed.\r\n\r\nThen, when the patriarch and the bishop of Beyroot wished to dispute\r\nwith me, I expressed the hope that the discussion might be in meekness,\r\nand without anger. It was concluded that the discussion should be in\r\nwriting, that no one afterwards should be able to alter what he had once\r\nsaid. They then commenced by asking me questions; the first question\r\nwas, in amount, this, \"Has the Messiah given us a new law?\" At first, I\r\ndid not grant that he had, strictly speaking, given us a new law, and\r\nquoted the words of John, that \"the law was given by Moses, but grace\r\nand truth came by Jesus Christ;\" but when I afterwards saw that by \"_a\r\nnew law_,\" they meant merely the gospel, or the New Testament, I\r\nanswered in the affirmative. They then asked me if there was not to be\r\nfound in this new law some obscurities. I answered, \"Yes.\" They then\r\nasked me, Suppose any difference of sentiment should arise between the\r\nteachers of Christianity, how are we to distinguish the truth from the\r\nerror? I answered thus;--\"We have no other means of arriving at the\r\ntruth, than searching the word of God, with learning, and reason, and\r\ninquiry of learned spiritual teachers, with purity of motive, and with\r\ndisinterestedness of inclination. If the obscurities of the word of God\r\ncannot be understood by these means, our ignorance is excusable, and\r\nwill not prevent our salvation. If the passages, which still remain\r\nobscure, concern faith, it is sufficient for a man to say, I believe\r\naccording as the truth is in itself before God, or I believe in the\r\nthing as God inspired it to the writer. And if the obscurity respects\r\nour practice, after making use of the means above mentioned, if that\r\nbranch of our practice be forbidden, or under a doubt, desist from it,\r\nbut if it is not forbidden, do it, and _Blessed is he that condemneth\r\nnot himself in the thing which he alloweth._\"\r\n\r\nAfter I had given them this answer, they brought no evidence to prove\r\nany error in it, and moreover afterwards never put to me any question to\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nOnce, as I was walking with the bishop of Beyroot, he began to tell me\r\nhow much they all felt for me; and how unwilling they should be to put\r\nme in chains to die a lingering death; and that were it not for the\r\nsympathy and their love towards me, there were people who had conversed\r\nwith them, who were ready to take my life. Some further conversation\r\npassed, and I began to introduce the subject of religion, and to ask how\r\nwe could believe in the pope that he was infallible. He quoted for proof\r\nthe words of our Saviour, _Thou art Peter, &c._ I asked him if it was\r\nproper to suppose that all things bestowed on Peter, were also given to\r\nthe pope? If so, why does not the pope speak with tongues; and why is he\r\nnot secure from the evil effects of poison, &c.? He answered, that these\r\nlast things were not necessary. \"But how do you prove it necessary,\"\r\nsaid I, \"that the pope should not err? Is it not sufficient if any one\r\nhas doubts, to ask his teacher who is not infallible? if you say _yes_,\r\nthen the opinion of the fallible man will answer. But if you say _no_,\r\nand that we _must_ go to the pope, what must become of the man who dies\r\nbefore the answer of the pope can reach him?\"\r\n\r\nHe then resorted to another mode of proof, saying, \"Is it not desirable\r\nthat the pope should be infallible?\" I assured him I wished he might be\r\nso. \"Well, is not God able to render him so?\" \"Yes, He is able to do all\r\nthings.\" He wished to infer his point from these two premises. But I\r\nsaid, \"your reasoning with regard to the _pope_, may be applied to all\r\nthe bishops of the church; for it is desirable that they should all be\r\ninfallible, and God is able to make them so.\" He said, \"No, for the\r\nbishops feeling less their need of the pope, would not look to him, or\r\nsubmit to him as their head, and then there would be divisions and\r\ncontentions in the church.\" But why, said I, did not divisions and\r\ncontentions arise among the apostles? Were they not all infallible as\r\nwell as Peter? He would not say they _were_ infallible. I told him, that\r\nwas an opinion that could not be believed, that the pope was infallible,\r\nand the apostles not; for it was well known to all, that the Holy Spirit\r\ndescended upon the apostles in a peculiar manner. I asked him again, how\r\nit could be made to appear that divisions would be produced if all\r\nbishops were infallible, for if they were all of one opinion, as they of\r\ncourse would be, their union must be the more perfect. We conversed\r\nfarther at some length, when he concluded by saying, \"You are possessed\r\nof a devil.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, as the patriarch and the bishop of Beyroot were seated\r\nunder a tree without the convent, I went out to them, and said, \"Your\r\nholiness sent to me to come hither for employment, and I came, and have\r\nremained here a considerable time. What do you wish me to do for you,\r\nfor I cannot remain here in idleness?\" He said, \"What do you wish to\r\ndo?\" If your holiness pleases, that I teach in the school of Ain Warka,\r\nI will do that. \"No, I cannot have you go to Ain Warka, to corrupt the\r\nminds of those who are studying science, and to contradict my opinions.\"\r\nBut I will instruct in grammar. \"No, the youths of the college are now\r\nattending to _moral_ science.\" Well, I only beg you will let me know\r\nwhat I am to do, and if you have no employment for me, I wish to return\r\nhome. The bishop here broke in upon the conversation, saying, I will not\r\nsuffer you to go back among my flock to deceive them, and turn them away\r\nto heresy. Will you then debar me, said I, from my home? If so, let me\r\nknow where I shall go, what I shall do? The bishop then said to the\r\npatriarch, \"Indeed I will not suffer this man to go abroad among my\r\npeople, for he is even attempting to make heretics of us also.\" Yes\r\nreplied the patriarch, it will not do after this, to afford him a\r\nresidence in any part of the land. The bishop then turned to me, in the\r\nbitterest anger and rage, reviling me and saying, \"If you go among my\r\npeople again, I will send and take your life, though it be in the bosom\r\nof your own house.\" I said, \"Well, what would you have me to do, and\r\nwhat will you do with me? If you wish to kill me, or shut me up in\r\nprison, or give me up to the government, or whatever it may be, I wish\r\nto know it.\" \"You must wait here till spring or summer,\" said the\r\npatriarch, \"and then we shall see how you are.\" I answered him in the\r\nwords of that christian who was given by his judge ten days to\r\ndeliberate whether he would worship an image: \"_Consider the time\r\nalready past, and do what you please._\"\r\n\r\nI asked the bishop his reasons for wishing to kill me. What evil had I\r\ndone? He was filled with high and bitter indignation, saying, \"What,\r\nmiscreant! Shall we let you go forth to corrupt my flock for me? Is not\r\nwhat has passed enough?\" I rose and said to them, \"God at least is with\r\nme,\" and left them. The patriarch sent after me his nephew, requesting\r\nme, in soothing words to return, and saying that he would do what I\r\nwished.\r\n\r\nBut when I contemplated the hardness of heart manifested by the bishop,\r\nI could not restrain myself from reproving him, hoping that he would\r\ngrow mild. I said, therefore, \"Our Lord Jesus Christ said, _out of the\r\nabundance of the heart the mouth speaketh_, and that Satan, who was in\r\nhis heart, wished to kill me, for Satan was a murderer from the\r\nbeginning.\" I told him, moreover, that he was not a true disciple of\r\nChrist. And when I had left them a second time, the patriarch again sent\r\nhis nephew to enquire of me what I wished; whether it was money, or what\r\nelse, promising that he would answer my enquiries.\r\n\r\nI returned and told him, that I had a request to make of _one thing\r\nonly_, and that I hoped he would answer me, not as to a little child,\r\nwho would ask a childish thing. He asked me what it was. I said I have\r\nto ask of you the favour to send from your priests two faithful men to\r\npreach the gospel through the country, and I am ready, if necessary, to\r\nsell all that I possess to give to them as part of their wages. He\r\npromised me it should be done. But I had reason to expect that he would\r\nreceive such a request as from the mouth of one out of his reason. Now\r\nthere was at the convent a man called Hoory Gabriel, who was said to be\r\ninsane, and was known to all his acquaintance as a man that never would\r\nsay a word on the subject of religion, and he was a scribe of the\r\npatriarch, and from the time of my arrival until that day, had never\r\nasked me a single question about my faith, or opinions, nor had given me\r\nthe least word of advice about any of my errors. The same night, as this\r\npriest was passing the evening in company with the patriarch, bishop,\r\nand other individuals, as if they had been conversing on my idiocy in\r\nmaking the request of to-day, the patriarch sent for me to come and sit\r\nwith them. I came. The patriarch then asked this priest and the others\r\npresent, if two proper men could be found to go and preach the gospel.\r\nThey then answered one to another, such an one, and such an one, would\r\nbe the fittest persons, some mentioning one and some another, looking at\r\nme in the mean time laughing, to see what I would say.\r\n\r\nI smiled in a pleasant manner at all this, and when one asked me, why I\r\nlaughed? I said to the patriarch, \"Have you not perfect confidence in\r\nthe integrity of the priest Gabriel?\" He said, \"Yes.\" I then said, pray\r\nlet this priest then examine me for the space of a few days, and if he\r\ndoes not conclude that I am a heretic, I will for _one_, take upon\r\nmyself this duty of preaching. This remark put an immediate end to the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThe third day, when the bishop wished to mock me before the patriarch\r\nand a shekh of the country, I answered his questions according to his\r\nown manner; but in a little time he began to revile me, and rebuke me\r\nfor blasphemy against the eucharist, against the virgin Mary and the\r\npictures, and that because I had said before one of his deacons, that\r\nwere it not for fear of the patriarch, I would tear all the pictures to\r\npieces and burn them. I gave him answer to every particular by itself,\r\nand when he found that he could produce against me no accusation, he\r\nincreased in wrath. I then said, if this is your pleasure, I will say no\r\nmore. I told him that I had said, that pictures were not Gods; that such\r\nwas my opinion always; and that I wished to tell all the common people\r\nso, that they might understand it. But to this he would not consent. He\r\nthen began to accuse me of saying of the eucharist, \"Let them smell the\r\nscent of it, and know that it is but bread and wine still.\" I told him\r\nthat if he would give me leave to speak, or if he wished to hear my\r\nviews, I would speak; \"but how is it that you bring against me\r\naccusations, and do not suffer me to make my defence?\" Here again he was\r\nnot willing that I should speak, but the patriarch said to me,\r\n\"_Speak_.\" I then observed, that St. Ephraim says, \"Come, eat the fire\r\nof the bread, and drink the spirit of the wine;\" and began to say from\r\nthis, that our eating the body of Christ was not natural, but spiritual.\r\nThen again he fell into a rage against me. I said to him, \"It is\r\nwritten, _be ye angry and sin not_. I told you before, that I would keep\r\nsilence and not speak without your consent, and whatever you wish, tell\r\nme that I may act or refrain accordingly.\" At this the patriarch smiled.\r\nBut the bishop fell into a passion still more violent, against the\r\npatriarch as well as myself, and rose and went away. I also left the\r\nroom. In the evening, when were collected together the patriarch and\r\nbishop and all the monks, with priest Nicholas, whom they were about to\r\nordain bishop on the morrow, the patriarch began to ask me questions\r\nrespecting my faith. When I saw that their object was neither to benefit\r\nme, nor receive benefit, I gave them answers calculated to continue the\r\nconversation in a trifling strain, saying, \"My faith is the faith of\r\nPeter, and the faith of Peter is my faith. I believe all that God has\r\ngiven by inspiration to the one only holy catholic church.\" He asked me,\r\nWhat is the church? I answered, \"The church is the whole company of\r\nthose who believe in the Messiah and his law, on all the face of the\r\nearth.\" But where is the place of the church? \"The place of the church\r\nis the whole world, it is made up of every nation and people.\" \"What,\"\r\nsaid he \"the _English_ among the rest?\" \"Yes, of the English also.\"\r\nAfterwards, when he continued to question me, and I saw that he had no\r\nother object than to try me, I assured him, this is my faith, and to\r\nthis faith will I hold, whether it is worth any thing in your estimation\r\nor not. I then asked him if he was willing to hold a discussion on the\r\nsubject; but he would not permit it in any shape. He afterwards\r\nrequested me to tell my faith again without fear and without\r\nconcealment. I referred them to the priest that was about to be\r\nordained, saying, that I had conversed with him on all points\r\nparticularly, and that he was able to make answer for me. The priest\r\nthen bore testimony on the spot, that I had said before him that I\r\nbelieved the pope to be infallible, while I never said this to him at\r\nany time. Afterward, when I was in his company privately, I inquired how\r\nhe could bear such testimony as he had done. He confessed in the fullest\r\nterms, that he knew it was a falsehood, but that he said what he did,\r\nthat they might cease talking with me. The same night I had resolved on\r\nquitting them; so at about midnight I left the convent, committing\r\nmyself to the protection of God, who never deserts them who put their\r\ntrust in him, and arrived at Beyroot, on the morning of Thursday, March\r\n2, 1826.\r\n\r\nHere then I remain at present, not that I may take my views from the\r\nEnglish, or from the Bible men, nor that I may receive my religion from\r\nthem. No, by no means; for I hold to the word of God. This is beyond all\r\ndanger of error. In this I believe; in this is my faith; and according\r\nto it I desire to regulate my life, and enjoy all my consolations. By\r\nthis I wish to show what I believe and not to confer with flesh and\r\nblood, that I may not run now nor hereafter in vain; for I know and am\r\npersuaded, that the true religion is not according to the teaching of\r\nmen, but according to the inspiration of God: not according to the\r\ncustom of education, but according to the truth, which is made manifest\r\nby the word of God. I therefore say to myself now, as I did in the\r\nconvent with the patriarch, where I wrote thus:\r\n\r\n\"Far from me be all the commandments of men. Nothing is to come into\r\ncomparison with the teaching of Jesus by reading the New Testament. If\r\nour _hearts are not transformed_, there is the greatest danger that we\r\ndie in our sins. If any thing in the doctrine of Jesus seems burdensome,\r\nlet us pray that he may make it light; and if there is any thing that we\r\ndo not understand, let us pray that he would instruct us and reveal the\r\nobscurity to all who truly believe in Jesus. There is nothing more\r\ndelightful to the soul than he. O taste and see that the Lord is good!\r\nBlessed are all that put their trust in him! Cast thy burthen on the\r\nLord and he will sustain thee. Sweet is the sorrow produced by his word;\r\nfor it gives us an aversion to all the consolations of time. Let us\r\ntherefore seek refuge in God. Alas for thee, O thou that trustest to the\r\ndoctrines of men, especially if they give rest to your conscience, for\r\nthat rest is false and deceitful, proceeding from the thoughts of men,\r\nand preventing you from attaining that true rest, of which the Apostles\r\nspeak, saying, _We do rest from our labours._ Take heed lest there be in\r\nany of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.\r\nRead the word and it shall teach you all things necessary to your\r\nsalvation. If you say you do not understand it, behold the promise of\r\nSt. James, _If any may lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to\r\nall men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him._ The\r\ndivine word is a most precious treasure, from which all wise men are\r\nenriched. Drink from the fountain itself. Again, I say, vain is the\r\nphilosophy of men; for it recommends to us doctrines newly invented, and\r\nprevents our increase in virtue, rather than promotes it. Cast it far\r\nfrom you.\"\r\n\r\nThis is what I wrote some time since, and I would revolve these thoughts\r\nin my mind at all times. The object in all that I have done, or\r\nattempted, or written, in this late occurrence, is, that I may act as a\r\ndisciple and servant of Christ. I could not, therefore, receive any\r\nadvice, which should direct me to hide my religion under a bushel. I\r\ncannot regulate myself by any rules contrary to those of Christ; for I\r\nbelieve that all who follow his word in truth, are the good grain, and\r\nthat all those who add to his word, are the tares sown by the enemy,\r\nwhich shall soon be gathered in bundles and cast into the fire\r\nunquenchable. And I beg every member of my sect, i. e. of the Maronite\r\nchurch, who loves truth, if he sees me in an error to point it out to\r\nme, that I may leave it, and cleave to the truth. But I must request\r\nthose who would rectify my views, not to do as did a priest at Beyroot,\r\nwho after a considerable discussion, denied the inspiration of the New\r\nTestament. Men like him I do not wish to attempt to point out my errors;\r\nfor such men, it is evident, need rather to be preached to, than to\r\npreach; and to be guided, rather than to guide. But if any understanding\r\nman will take the word of God and prove to me from it any doctrine\r\nwhatever, I will respect him and honour him with all pleasure. But if a\r\ndoctrine cannot be established thus, it is not only opposed to the\r\ndoctrines of Christ, but to the views of the early christians, the\r\nfathers of the church; such as St. Ephraim and others. Such doctrines I\r\ncannot confess to be correct, although it should cost me the shedding of\r\nmy blood. Be it known, that I am not seeking money, nor office; nor do I\r\nfear any thing from contempt, nor from the cross, nor from the\r\npersecution of men, nor from their insults, nor their evil accusations,\r\nso far as they are false. For I am ready for the sake of Christ to die\r\ndaily, to be accounted as a sheep for the slaughter, for he, in that he\r\nsuffered being tempted, is able to succour those that are tempted. I\r\nconsider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be\r\ncompared with the glory that shall be revealed in us. I believe that\r\nJesus is our High Priest for ever and hath an unchangeable priesthood,\r\nwherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by\r\nhim, for he is the one Mediator between God and man, and he ever liveth\r\nto make intercession with the Father for us; and he is the propitiation\r\nfor our sins, and to him be glory with the Father and his Holy Spirit of\r\nlife for ever and ever--_Amen._\r\n\r\nI would only add, if there is any one, whoever he may be, that will shew\r\nme to be under a mistake, and that there is no salvation for me unless I\r\nsubmit to the pope, or at least shew me that it is lawful to do so, I am\r\nready to give up all my peculiar views and submit in the Lord. But\r\nwithout evidence that my views are thus mistaken, I cannot give them up,\r\nand yield a blind obedience, until it shall be not only _told_ that I am\r\nmad, but until I shall be so in _fact_, and all my understanding leaves\r\nme. Not until men shall have burned not only the Bibles printed by the\r\nEnglish, but all the Bibles of the world. But these two things,\r\nunderstanding and the Bible, I pray God to preserve both to me and to\r\nall the followers of Christ, and that he will preserve and save all you,\r\nmy friends, in the Lord.\r\n\r\n        ASAAD SHIDIAK.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interview with several of his Relatives._\r\n\r\n6. Among those who came to see Asaad to-day, were three of his brothers\r\nand an uncle. Mansoor, the oldest of the brothers, we had never before\r\nseen. He is a furious bigot, and perfectly ignorant and regardless of\r\nthe first principles of religion. The second, Tannoos, or Antony, has\r\nlived among us as a teacher, and has good native and acquired talents;\r\nbut, though he might be a protestant if he were left at liberty, he\r\nthinks it altogether preposterous to attempt to quarrel with bishops and\r\npatriarchs on the subject of religion.\r\n\r\nThese two brothers, and the uncle, (the last worse than the first,) came\r\nand conversed together with Asaad in his chamber a considerable time.\r\nHearing them very earnest, I took the liberty also to go in. They\r\ncontinued their rebukes and arguments, (especially the uncle,) in so\r\nharsh and unfeeling a manner, that it made me tremble to hear them. They\r\ncontradicted Asaad, scoffed at and threatened him, calling him\r\npossessed, mad, under the power of Satan, and so on. Asaad consented to\r\ngo home and leave the English, which was the great point they wished to\r\ngain, provided they would get an assurance from the patriarch in\r\nwriting, to say, on the faith of a christian, that he would not molest\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said they, \"then you must hold your tongue, and not broach your\r\nnew opinions among the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"What,\" replied Asaad, \"must I go and live like a _dumb_ man? No, that I\r\nwill never do. My religion binds me not to do it. I must love my\r\nneighbour as myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you not go,\" said they, \"to the Druses, and the Moslems, and\r\npreach the gospel to them? You answer, because there is danger. So there\r\nis danger in the present case; this is not a land of liberty, therefore\r\nbe silent.\"\r\n\r\n_Asaad._--\"Secure me but the free exercise of my conscience, and I will\r\ngo with you. My religion is my all, and I must be free in it.\"\r\n\r\n_They._--\"We can give you no such security. Nobody dares go to the\r\npatriarch with such a request. You cannot be permitted to publish your\r\nnotions abroad among the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Asaad, \"there is no more to be said;\"--rising, and with\r\nclasped hands walking the room;--\"_Religion unshackled--Religion\r\nunshackled_, is my doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nThey rose and left the room in an angry despair. Mansoor returned, and\r\nwished to speak a word with Asaad at the door. In a moment, Asaad\r\nreturned. \"Do you know what Mansoor has told me?\" said he. \"His last\r\nwords were, 'Even if the patriarch and the emir should do nothing; if\r\nthey make no attempts to take your life; be assured, _we ourselves_ will\r\ndo the work: so take heed to your self accordingly.'\"\r\n\r\nAsaad was much affected by the interview. As soon as he found himself at\r\nliberty, he stepped up into the loft where he sleeps, and threw himself\r\non his couch in prayer.\r\n\r\nWhile in this attitude his next younger brother, Galed, knocked at the\r\ndoor. I called to Asaad to inform him of the fact; but he gave me no\r\nanswer. I then invited Galed to another room, where Asaad soon joined us\r\nwith a full and heavy heart. The two brothers saluted each other with\r\nembarrassment. Asaad evidently wished to be alone, and the brother,\r\nafter a few mild, unmeaning inquiries, left him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Begins to converse more pointedly with the People._\r\n\r\n7. I yesterday advised Asaad to direct his conversations with the\r\npeople, as much as possible to their hearts, and say little or nothing\r\non the corruption of their church. He objected to the counsel. I\r\nreferred him to similar advice he gave me some months ago. \"Ah,\" said\r\nhe, \"I thought so then, but I now see that you cannot stir a step, but\r\nyou meet some of their corruptions.\" However, he to-day made the\r\nexperiment, and held an hour's conversation with two visiters on the\r\nsubject of regeneration. They both thought themselves renewed, but took\r\ntoo little interest in the subject to confine their attention to it.\r\n\"You see,\" said Asaad, after they had gone, \"how little they feel on\r\nsuch a subject. It is painful to talk with such men. I would rather see\r\nthem contradict, and dispute, and get angry, or any thing, than to\r\nappear so dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interview with a younger Brother._\r\n\r\nAsaad's brother Galed came again to-day, and discovered more feeling\r\nthan yesterday on the subject of his brother's leaving the English. He\r\nsaid he had brought an insupportable shame upon the family. Asaad\r\ninsisted, that such shame was no argument whatever for his leaving us;\r\nthat all the disciples of Christ were to expect it as a thing of course.\r\nGaled assured him, that nobody would think of molesting him, if he were\r\nat Hadet. I asked Galed if his brother Mansoor did not threaten\r\nyesterday to kill him. He turned away, colored, and muttered something\r\nthat I did not understand; but the whole was a full acknowledgment of\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\nAsaad said, \"I cannot confide in you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Galed, \"if any one were disposed to take your life, could\r\nthey not do it as well here, as at home?\"\r\n\r\nI answered, \"no; that the emir Beshir himself could not enter my house\r\nwithout my permission, and that if the relatives of Asaad did not cease\r\nfrom their threats, I should feel myself bound to shut them out of it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a long conversation, at the end of which he found Asaad as\r\ninflexible as ever, he rose abruptly, and was going out without a\r\ncompliment, when Asaad started up, and asked, \"Well, what do you\r\nconclude to do? Do you really intend to send some assassin to take my\r\nlife in my room?\" The youth, without deigning to look at him, closed the\r\ndoor in sullen grief, and departed.\r\n\r\nAsaad turning to me, said, \"I cannot please these people. Whatever I\r\nsay, they are sure to be angry. Soft words, or hard words, it makes no\r\ndifference to them. They come as if I were under their kingly authority.\r\nThey lay hold of my cloak, and say, 'Give me this.' If I say, 'I will\r\nnot give it,' they are angry; and if I reason with them with all the\r\nmildness of which I am capable, and say, 'Cannot you be accommodated\r\nelsewhere? Can you not wait upon me in a few days?' &c. they are equally\r\nangry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Correspondence with his family._\r\n\r\n8. A messenger called this morning with the following note.\r\n\r\n\"To our brother Asaad Esh Shidiak: May God bless you.--We beg you to\r\ncome home to-night, and not wait till Sunday. We have pledged our mother\r\nthat you shall come. If you fail to do so, you will trouble us all. Your\r\nbrother,\r\n\r\n                                                               GALED.\"\r\n\r\nTo this letter, Asaad sat down, and instantly wrote the following reply:\r\n\r\n\"To our much honoured and very dear brother Galed: God preserve\r\nhim.--Your note has reached us, in which you speak of our coming home\r\nto-night, and say, that if we do not come, we trouble you all.\r\n\r\n\"Now if we were in some distant land, your longing after us in this\r\nmanner might be very proper; but we are near you, and you have been\r\nhere, and seen us in all health, and we have seen you. Then quiet our\r\nmother, that we, through the bounty of God, are in perfect health, and\r\nthat we have great peace in the Lord Jesus Christ, peace above all that\r\nthe world can afford, and abundant joy in the Holy Ghost above all\r\nearthly joy. But as to our coming up this evening, we do not find it\r\nconvenient, not even though we had the strongest desire to see our\r\nmother and you.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you all to love God, and to serve him in our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\nThis is of all things the most important; for if we love God, if he but\r\nrenew our hearts by the holy Ghost, we shall enjoy each other's society\r\nfor ever and ever.\r\n\r\n\"And now we are prevented from coming to you, and you know we are not\r\nvoid of all desire to see you, but the hindrances to which we have\r\nalluded, are, we think, a sufficient apology. We beg you to accept our\r\nexcuse, and to apologize for us to our mother, and we pray God to pour\r\nout his grace richly on you all, and lengthen your days.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"Your brother, ASAAD.\r\n\r\n\"P. S. Tell our mother not to think so much of these earthly things but\r\nrather of God our Saviour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Is visited by his Mother._\r\n\r\nThis letter had been gone scarcely time sufficient to reach Hadet, when\r\nthe mother herself was announced at the door. We welcomed her with all\r\ncordiality, and treated her with all the respect and attention we could.\r\nBut all we could do or say did not alter her resolution to get her son\r\naway, if in her power. She besought him by the honour he owed her, by\r\nthe love he professed for her, by his regard for the reputation of her\r\nfamily, for religion itself, and for his own personal safety, that he\r\nwould immediately accompany her home; and when she found him inflexible,\r\nshe declared she would never stir out of the house unless he went with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTo all this Asaad replied, \"To what purpose would it be, that I should\r\ngo home? You wish me to go, you say, that people may be convinced that I\r\nam not mad. But you, who come hither, and see, and converse with me,\r\nsay, after all, that I _am_ mad. How can it be expected that I should\r\nconvince others that I am _not_ mad, when my own mother will not believe\r\nit. Or do you think that if I once get out among you, the air of Hadet\r\nwill change my opinions, or induce me to be silent? All these are vain\r\nexpectations. I see no object to be gained. If I should go to Hadet, and\r\nbe constantly disputing with the people, and telling them, that you are\r\nall going astray; that you are worshipping idols instead of the living\r\nGod; that I could wish to tear down every picture in your churches; that\r\nthe bread and wine of the Lord's Supper are not Jesus Christ; that I\r\nbelieve the pope to be the beast in the revelation,[I] whose business is\r\nto deceive the people and ruin their souls;--by all this, I should\r\ninjure your feelings, enrage the people, excite the opposition of the\r\nemirs, and bishops, and patriarchs, and then return here just in the\r\nstate I am in now.\"\r\n\r\nThe youngest brother, Phares, who accompanied his mother, conversed\r\nfreely and in good temper, and listened with attention to all Asaad's\r\narguments, by which he endeavoured to justify his views and\r\ndeterminations. But no argument or evidence could convince the\r\ndisconsolate mother. Asaad had repeated the name of Christ, and the word\r\nof God so often, that she, at last, in a fit of impatience exclaimed,\r\n\"Away, with Christ, and the word of God; what have we to do with them!\"\r\nand when we pointed out to Asaad some text of Scripture, which we\r\nthought applicable in any case, she would endeavour to close the book,\r\nor catch it from him, as if it taught paganism, or witchcraft. During\r\nher stay we dined, and as Asaad took the meat upon his plate, and ate it\r\nwithout a scruple, in this season of Lent, it was remarked with what a\r\ngaze of wonder she regarded him. She seemed to say in her heart, \"All is\r\nover--my son is lost!\"\r\n\r\nAfter some hours of troublesome expostulation and entreaty, during which\r\nAsaad once said he could bear it no longer, and rose, and shook my hand\r\nto go, it was finally settled that the mother should go home without\r\nhim, but that to save the family from the insupportable shame, which\r\nthreatened it, Asaad should give her a paper, stating, in effect, that\r\nhe was not a follower of the English. When the paper was finished,\r\n\"Now,\" said Asaad, \"go to your home in peace;\" and walked away; but\r\nsuddenly recollecting himself, he called his brother back, and said,\r\n\"Phares, I wish you fully to understand, that I love you, and I have one\r\nrequest to make of you, which is, that you will take the New Testament,\r\nand read it attentively.\"--\"Give me a New Testament,\" said Phares,\r\nquickly. We gave him the book, and he went his way, evidently affected\r\nand softened by the interview.\r\n\r\n9. The shekh before mentioned communicated to Asaad, through the medium\r\nof a priest, the offer of his daughter in marriage, on condition he\r\nshould leave the English.\r\n\r\n10. Set apart a day of fasting and prayer on Asaad's account. He was\r\nobserved not to be in a happy temper. Towards evening he spoke of going\r\nhome. I hoped he would finish writing the statement we had requested of\r\nhim, \"for,\" said I, \"if you go home I shall not see you again for\r\nmonths.\" \"No,\" said he, \"perhaps not for years.\" His manner was very\r\npeculiar. I knew not what was the matter, till, in the evening, after a\r\nlong conversation on the evidences of inspiration, he said, \"I have been\r\nin deep darkness to-day. My heart has been full of blasphemy, such as I\r\nhave scarcely ever known. I have even doubted the existence of God. But\r\nnow I am relieved, and I would just say, I shall not go home to-morrow,\r\nas I hinted.\"\r\n\r\nThis temptation seems to have arisen chiefly from a discrepancy in the\r\nscriptures, which I had shewed him, and which I knew not how to\r\nreconcile. He begged that, for the present, I would by no means shew him\r\nanother such.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suspects himself to have been poisoned._\r\n\r\n11. One of the neighbours brought Shidiak a letter, cautioning him, if\r\nhe went to the shekh's house, not to smoke or drink with him.\r\n\r\n12. Word came to Asaad, that the shekh was with the family below, and\r\nwould be glad to see him. Asaad went down, but in a few minutes came up,\r\npale and trembling, and said he was exceedingly dizzy and faint. He had\r\njust taken coffee below, attended with suspicious circumstances, and\r\nbegged to know if he might not be poisoned. We opened a medical book we\r\nhad, and explained to him, as rapidly as possible, the symptoms of a\r\npoisoned person. \"Oh! these are my feelings,\" said he, and fell upon his\r\nknees before his seat in silent prayer. We immediately gave him an\r\nemetic, which operated well, and before night he was relieved of every\r\nalarming symptom. The youth who gave the coffee, being sent for, gave\r\ngood evidence of having had no bad intentions; and notwithstanding many\r\nsuspicious circumstances, we did not think the evidence of an attempt at\r\npoison sufficiently strong, to prosecute any public inquiry into the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n16. A youth from Der el Kamer called to see Asaad. He remarked, that he\r\nonce saw a priest at his village tear in pieces five of these books of\r\nours, but he could not tell for what reasons. He had, apparently, never\r\nseen the ten commandments before, and was very much surprised to find\r\nimage-worship so expressly condemned in them. A letter was received by\r\nAsaad from the patriarch, written in very plausible terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Visits his Relatives at Hadet._\r\n\r\n17. Four of the relatives of Asaad came down, and succeeded in\r\npersuading him to accompany them home. He said he could not believe,\r\nafter all that has been said, that they would do him violence, and he\r\nstrongly expected that his visit to Hadet would do good. A majority of\r\nus opposed his going with all we could say; but he thinks he knows the\r\npeople here better than we do. He left us toward evening, expecting to\r\nbe absent only a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Their violence, and the consequent proceedings of Phares Shidiak._\r\n\r\n24. Phares Shidiak came to my house to day, and wished to speak with me\r\nin private.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday morning,\" said he, \"as I was in my room reading the New\r\nTestament, my brother Mansoor entered, drew a sword he had, and gave me\r\na blow upon the neck. I continued with the book in my hand, until one\r\nsnatched it from me. Mansoor afterwards drew up his musket, threatening\r\nto shoot me; but my mother interfered to prevent him. My brother Tannoos\r\nhearing a bustle, came in with a cane, and began cudgelling me, without\r\nstopping to inquire at all into the merits of the case, calling out,\r\n'Will you leave off your heresy, and go to church like other people, or\r\nnot?' Mansoor not finding Asaad present, as he seemed to have expected,\r\nwent to Asaad's chest which stood near me, seized all the books he had\r\nreceived of you, Hebrew, Syriac, Italian, and Arabic, tore them, one by\r\none, in pieces, and strewed them on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of the day, I came down near where the soldiers of the\r\nemir are encamped, and passed the night in company with my brother\r\nGaleb. This morning _he_ returned, with a line from me to Asaad, and _I_\r\ncame off to Beyroot, with the full determination never to go home\r\nagain. And now I will either go to some place in this country where I\r\ncan enjoy my liberty or I will take ship, and leave the country\r\naltogether.\"\r\n\r\nAs he wished my advice, I counselled him neither to go from the country,\r\nnor from his home, but to return, and at least make a further trial of\r\ndoing good to his relatives, and bearing their persecutions. He,\r\nhowever, continued inflexible.\r\n\r\nIn the space of a few hours, Galeb came in search of Phares, with a\r\nletter from Asaad, of which the following is a copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Asaad's letter to his brother Phares._\r\n\r\n\"To my beloved brother Phares; the Lord Most High preserve him. Your\r\ndeparture caused me great grief. _First_, because you were impatient\r\nwhen trial and persecution came upon you. It is a thing we are regularly\r\nto expect, that if we hope in God in this world, we shall give universal\r\noffence. But we have another city, for which we hope. Do not lose your\r\ncourage, for you have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.\r\nRemember, we cannot share in the glory of Christ, if we share not also\r\nin his sufferings. Therefore, rejoice whenever you are tried; rejoice,\r\nand never be sad; for our faith is sure.\r\n\r\n\"_Secondly_, I was grieved because you gave me no information where you\r\nwere going, and what you intended to do. Now, it is not becoming, that\r\nwe should do any thing rashly, that is, till we have prayed to God for\r\ndirection. Come home, then, and let us set apart a season of fasting and\r\nprayer to God, and do what is most agreeable to him. Perhaps it is best\r\nto let our works preach in silence, in these evil days.\r\n\r\n\"You must know, that if you fail to come home, you will give us great\r\npain, and this, you know, would be inconsistent with love. Jesus says,\r\n'By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love\r\none to another.' You well know how much joy and consolation it would\r\ngive us to see you; do not then deny us this pleasure, but come at all\r\nevents. If you do not come, it may be an injury both to yourself and me.\r\nI wish to see you, if it be only to say to you two words, and then act\r\nyour pleasure; for not every word can be said with paper and pen.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\"Your brother and companion in tribulation,\r\n\r\n                                                           ASAAD.\"\r\n\r\nGaleb took me aside, and begged me to urge his brother to go home. I\r\nsaid I had already advised him to do so, but that I could not force him\r\nto go--that if he found he could not enjoy liberty of conscience, and\r\nthe privilege of reading the word of God, in Hadet, he was welcome to\r\nstay with me as long as he pleased. \"You are a man,\" said Galeb, \"that\r\nspeaks the truth and acts uprightly, but Asaad and Phares are not like\r\nyou; they talk very improper things.\" Among these things, he mentioned a\r\nreport to which Asaad had given circulation, respecting the patriarch,\r\nto which I was obliged to reply, that instead of taking it for granted\r\nto be a _false_ report, he ought to believe it to be true, and that such\r\na report was not abroad respecting the patriarch alone, but respecting a\r\nmajority of patriarchs and bishops of the whole land.\r\n\r\nAfter some further conversation on the wickedness of treating brothers,\r\nas they had done Phares and Asaad, we went to Phares, and endeavoured to\r\npersuade him to go home with his brother. But it was all in vain. \"If I\r\nleave this house,\" said he, \"instead of going to Hadet, I will go in the\r\nopposite direction.\" The brother returned without him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conversation of Phares with the Bishop of Beyroot._\r\n\r\nAfter Galeb had gone, we put a great many questions to Phares, and he\r\ncommunicated some interesting particulars. Among others was the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"The day that Asaad and myself left you, (the 17th,) the bishop of\r\nBeyroot was at the next house, and I went to salute him.\r\n\r\n\"He said to me, 'I understand _you_ have become English, too. You\r\n_reason on the subject of religion_.'\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, \"is every one English, if he _reasons_ on that subject?\"\r\n\r\n_Bishop._--\"But you read in the Bibles of the English.\"\r\n\r\n_Phares._--\"Yes, and from whom is the Bible? is it from the English, or\r\nfrom God?\"\r\n\r\n_B._--\"But it is _printed_ by the English.\"\r\n\r\n_P._--\"Well, is it altered in any place?\"\r\n\r\n_B._--\"See, now you have begun again to argue on the subject of\r\nreligion. I tell you, young man, cease this heretical habit, or you are\r\nexcommunicated.\"\r\n\r\nPhares informed us of three or four Bibles and New Testaments, that we\r\nhad given at different times to individuals in Hadet, which had lately\r\nbeen destroyed by order of the bishop. This news, together with a\r\ndiscovery we yesterday made in the neighbouring house, of two covers of\r\nthe New Testament, whose contents had long ago been torn out, shews us\r\nanew, if new evidence were wanting, that if the Gospel is ever\r\nintroduced again in its power and purity into this country, it will be\r\nwith a desperate struggle.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers of Phares, Mansoor and Galeb, came to converse with him\r\nanew. We saw them seated together on the ground, at a little distance\r\nfrom the house, but afterwards saw them no more. It is singular that\r\nPhares should have left without coming either to take his cloak, or bid\r\nus farewell.[J]\r\n\r\n28. Having heard nothing particular directly from Asaad since he left,\r\nespecially since the affair of the books, I yesterday sent him a line,\r\nand to-day received the following reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Asaad to Mr. Bird._\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir,--After expressing imperfectly the love I\r\n    bear you, and the desire I have to see you in all\r\n    health, I have to say, that in due time your letter\r\n    came to hand, and I read and understood it. You ask\r\n    respecting our health. I answer, I am in a state of\r\n    anxiety, but not so great as some days ago.\r\n\r\n    \"On Thursday last, having come home from a visit to\r\n    the emir Sulman, I found the remnants of the Holy\r\n    Scriptures, torn in pieces, as there is reason to\r\n    believe, by order of the bishop. When I was told,\r\n    that my brother Mansoor had done this mischief, I\r\n    returned to the emir, and informed him of the\r\n    affair. He sent to call Mansoor, while I returned\r\n    again to our house. I now learned, that my brother\r\n    Phares had gone off. After searching for him some\r\n    time, I went down to the inn in quest of him, but\r\n    he was not to be found. As I was on my way\r\n    returning from the inn, where I had gone in search\r\n    of my brother, I prayed to God, that he would take\r\n    every thing from me, if necessary, only let faith\r\n    and love towards him remain in my heart.\r\n\r\n    \"As I proceeded on, a man came up, and gave me\r\n    information that all the consuls of Beyroot were\r\n    slain, and that you also were slain with them. The\r\n    report came from a man, who said he had deposited\r\n    goods with you for safety. In order to be the more\r\n    sure, I asked the man if it were really true, and\r\n    he again assured me, that it was. Ask me not the\r\n    state of my feelings at that moment.\r\n\r\n    \"On reaching home, I heard this terrible news\r\n    confirmed; at the same time looking out, and seeing\r\n    the heap of ashes near the house, all that remained\r\n    of the 11 copies of the holy scriptures which my\r\n    brothers had destroyed, I burst into tears, and\r\n    committed all my concerns into the hands of God,\r\n    saying, 'Blessed be his holy name: the Lord gave,\r\n    and the Lord hath taken away;'--and so I prayed on,\r\n    with tears and groanings, which I cannot describe.\r\n\r\n    \"I afterwards heard, that Phares was probably in\r\n    the neighbourhood, and set off to search after him\r\n    by night, but found him not. When I heard the news\r\n    of your death confirmed, I sent off a messenger,\r\n    that, wherever Phares might be found, he might\r\n    return; and when I received his letter, saying that\r\n    he had gone to your house, I could not yet believe\r\n    that the report respecting you was false.\r\n\r\n    \"But when the truth on this subject began to\r\n    appear, then I heard by a person who came to the\r\n    yesterday evening, that the patriarch and the emir\r\n    had made an agreement to kill _me_, and that they\r\n    had sent men to lie in wait for that purpose. I was\r\n    afterwards told, by another person, that some of\r\n    the servants of the emir were appointed to\r\n    accomplish this end.\r\n\r\n    \"Here I am, then, in a sort of imprisonment,\r\n    enemies within, and enemies without.\r\n\r\n    \"One of my brothers, the other day, advised me to\r\n    surrender my self entirely to the mercy of the\r\n    bishop, whereupon I wrote the bishop a letter, (of\r\n    which I send you the enclosed copy,) and gave it to\r\n    my brother Tannoos, begging him to carry it to the\r\n    bishop, and bring me his reply. Tannoos read the\r\n    letter, and without saying a word, threw it down in\r\n    contempt. I then gave it to my uncle with the same\r\n    request, but as yet I have got no reply.[K]\r\n\r\n    \"All my concerns I commit into the hands of God,\r\n    who created me. Through the blood of our Lord Jesus\r\n    Christ, I hope that all my distresses will be for\r\n    the best.\r\n\r\n    \"I accept with pleasure all your kind wishes, and\r\n    send you many salutations in the Lord, and pray for\r\n    you length of days.\r\n\r\n                                    \"Yours, &c. ASAAD.\"\r\n\r\n     \"March 27, 1826.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_His relatives deliver him up to the Patriarch._\r\n\r\n31. Information is received, that Asaad has been taken away against his\r\nwill, to the patriarch.\r\n\r\n_April 4._ Phares Shidiak arrived here in the evening direct from Der\r\nAlma, and said he had accompanied Asaad to that convent a week ago, that\r\nAsaad was still there, and that the patriarch, having in the morning set\r\noff for Cannobeen, would send down for Assad after a few days. He then\r\nhanded me the following line from Asaad.\r\n\r\n\"If you can find a vessel setting off for Malta, in the course of four\r\nor five days, send me word; if not, pray for your brother.\r\n\r\n                                                           ASAAD.\"\r\n\r\nWe were disposed to send off a messenger this very evening, but Phares\r\nsaid it would not be necessary.\r\n\r\nHad some serious conversation with Phares, in which I exhorted him to\r\ncontinue reading the New Testament, and take particular notice of the\r\ngeneral spirit of it; and then to judge, if all this deceit, confining,\r\nbeating, and threatening to kill, was consistent with that spirit. We\r\nobserved, that we supposed the patriarch and the bishop were well\r\npleased with all the violence that Mansoor had used in this affair.\r\n\"Yes,\" said Phares, \"priest Hanna Stambodi, at Ain Warka, told me\r\nyesterday, that none of us had any religion, except Mansoor.\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent part of his journal, Mr. Bird records the following\r\nparticulars respecting Asaad, during his last visit to Hadet, and when\r\nabout to be violently removed from thence. They were received from\r\nPhares.\r\n\r\nA neighbouring emir being sick, one day, Asaad carried him a paper of\r\nmedicine, on the outside of which he had written how it was to be taken.\r\nWhile Asaad stood without, a servant took in this medicine, and gave it\r\nto the prince, saying, \"This is from Asaad Esh Shidiak, and here he has\r\nwritten the directions on the paper.\" The prince, who is not remarkable\r\nfor mildness, and perhaps was not conscious that Asaad overheard him,\r\nspoke out angrily, \"A fig for the paper and writing; 'tis the medicine I\r\nwant.\" \"Your lordship is in the right,\" replied Asaad, \"the truth is\r\nwith you. The _medicine_ is the thing; the _paper_ that holds it, is\r\nnothing. So we ought to say of the gospel, the great medicine for the\r\nsoul. 'Tis the _pure gospel_ we want, and not the _church_ that holds\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Mansoor, in his catholic zeal, had torn up and burned all his\r\nBibles and Testaments, Asaad could not remain without the scriptures,\r\nbut sent and obtained a copy from the little church, which he daily\r\nread, marking the most striking and important passages.\r\n\r\nWhen his relatives, to the number of twenty or more, had assembled, and\r\nAsaad perceived they were come to take him to the patriarch by force, he\r\nbegan to expostulate with Tannoos, and besought him to desist from a\r\nstep so inconsistent with fraternal love. He besought in vain. Tannoos\r\nturned away from him with a cold indifference. Affected with his\r\nhardness, Asaad went aside, and wept and prayed aloud.\r\n\r\nThe evening before he was taken away, he said to those who had\r\nassembled, \"If I had not read the gospel, I should have been surprised\r\nat this new movement of yours. But now it is just what I might have\r\nexpected. In this blessed book, I am told, _the brother shall deliver up\r\nthe brother to death, and a man's foes shall be they of his own\r\nhousehold_. Here you see it is just so. You have come together to fulfil\r\nthis prophecy of the gospel. What have I done against you? What is my\r\ncrime? Allowing that I do take the Bible as my only and sufficient guide\r\nto heaven, what sin is there in this?\" During the evening, he laid\r\nhimself down to sleep, as he was to set off early in the morning. But he\r\nwas often interrupted; for, whenever he caught a word of false doctrine\r\nfrom the lips of those who continued their conversation, he would rise\r\nup, refute them, and again compose himself to rest. One of his uncles,\r\nspeaking of his going to the patriarch, said in a great rage, \"If you\r\ndon't go off with us peaceably, we will take your life.\" Asaad replied,\r\n\"Softly, softly, my dear uncle, don't be hasty. _Blessed are the meek._\"\r\n\r\nPhares wrote a letter this evening to Asaad, in a hand that had been\r\nagreed on between them, saying, that if he would come to Beyroot, he\r\nneed not fear, and that it might be a matter for further consideration\r\nwhether he should leave the country.\r\n\r\n5. The letter of Phares was sent off by a moslem, who returned at\r\nevening, saying that when he arrived at the convent, he was accosted by\r\ntwo or three men, inquiring his business, telling him he was a Greek,\r\nand had letters from the English. They then seized him, and took the\r\nletter by force, and, had he not shewn them that he was a moslem, would\r\nhave probably sent him to the emir of the district for further\r\nexamination. They then asked him some questions about the English, and\r\nassured him that after eight days Asaad would no longer be a living man.\r\nThus were our hopes of a second deliverance of this sufferer of\r\npersecution, for the present, blasted. After all the threats, which have\r\nbeen thrown out without being put in execution, we rather hope, that\r\nthis last will prove like the rest; yet we cannot tell how far their\r\nhatred of the truth may, with the divine forbearance, carry them. We\r\nleave all with him, in whose hands our life and breath are, and whose\r\nare all our ways, with the humble hope, that light may yet arise out of\r\ndarkness, and that much glory may be added to his name, from this\r\nevident work of Satan.\r\n\r\n6. Sent word, in a blind hand, on a torn scrap of paper, to Phares\r\nrespecting the fate of our message to his brother. He returns answer\r\nthat he is coming to Beyroot to-morrow.\r\n\r\n7. Phares came, according to his notice of yesterday, saying, that if\r\nthe patriarch should get his letter to Asaad, there would be danger in\r\nhis staying at Hadet. He should be glad to go to Malta, or almost any\r\nother place out of the Maronite influence, lest his brothers should\r\nseize him, and deliver him up to the fury of the patriarch, as they had\r\ndone his brother Asaad. Mansoor, the eldest and most violent of them,\r\nwhen he heard, yesterday, that a letter had arrived for Phares from\r\nBeyroot, breathed out threatenings and slaughter, not only against\r\nPhares, but against the innocent messenger himself.\r\n\r\n8. Wrote to ----, a friendly Maronite bishop, to give me whatever\r\ninformation he might be able to procure respecting Shidiak.\r\n\r\n_May_ 10. A messenger whom we sent to Cannobeen, returned with the\r\nreport that he was denied the privilege of seeing Asaad, under pretence\r\nthat he was going through a course of confession, during which the rule\r\nis, that the person so confessing, shall pass his time, for a number of\r\ndays, alone, and see no company.\r\n\r\n14. We were, to-day, credibly informed, that Shidiak is still firm in\r\nhis adherence to the gospel, but that he was kept under rigid\r\ninspection, not being permitted to step out of his room without an\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\n17. Phares Shidiak informed us to-day, that he had been told that his\r\nbrother Asaad had been at the college of Ain Warka. He thought it might\r\nbe true, as one object in delivering him up to the patriarch was, to\r\ngive the people the general impression, that he had no longer any thing\r\nto do with the English. He had now been a sufficient time absent from us\r\nto give general currency to the report, that he was no longer with us,\r\nand now, perhaps, the patriarch had let him go free.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Asaad is cruelly treated._\r\n\r\n27. The messenger, who went before to Cannobeen, had set out to go for\r\nus a second time, and this morning early returned with the following\r\nstory:--Being met by a man near Batroon, whom he suspected to be from\r\nCannobeen, he inquired him out, and found him to be a messenger sent by\r\nAsaad himself to his uncles and other connexions, to beg them to come\r\nand deliver him. Asaad saw the man, and gave him his commission from the\r\nwindow of the convent, without the knowledge of the patriarch, or the\r\nothers in his service. This messenger said, _that Asaad was in close\r\nconfinement, in chains, and was daily beaten_; and that the great cause\r\nof complaint against him was, that he refused to worship either the\r\npictures, or the virgin Mary.\r\n\r\nI had written a letter of mere salutation to Shidiak by my messenger,\r\nwhich letter he enclosed in one from himself, and sent it on by his\r\nbrother, returning himself with the messenger from Asaad. This brother\r\nof his, he is much afraid, may be ill-treated by the patriarch.\r\n\r\n28. J., the messenger, called, and said, that he himself should not go\r\nto Cannobeen, but twelve or fifteen of his other relatives would go and\r\nendeavour at least to save him from chains and stripes. J. had been to\r\nthe emir Beshir the less, who lives at Hadet, begging him, (with a\r\npresent) to save his brother, if it should prove that he had suffered by\r\nthe suspicion or the resentment of the patriarch. The emir promised to\r\ninterfere--\"But why,\" said he, \"should Asaad go and join the English?\r\nthey are a people I do not love.\"\r\n\r\n_June_ 2. A youth of the neighbourhood said it was reported that Asaad\r\nwas a complete maniac; that he rent his garments, raved, reviled, &c.\r\nand that he had been sent to the convent at Koshia, like other lunatics,\r\nfor a miraculous cure. This news was brought by priest Bernardus, of\r\nGzir, mentioned in Shidiak's statement.\r\n\r\n3. The brother of J. about whom he was so solicitous, returned last\r\nevening in safety, with the following letter in Asaad's own hand\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n\"To our respected brother J. ----. After expressing my love to you, I\r\nhave to say, that your letter by your brother ----, arrived in safety,\r\nand I have understood it. In it you and ----, inquire after my health.\r\nMay the Lord pour out his grace upon you, and follow you with his\r\nblessings. As to me, I am at present in health, with regard to my\r\n_body_, but as to other circumstances, your brother will give you\r\ninformation. Love to cousin ----, your wife. Pray send me word\r\nrespecting you every opportunity, and may the Lord lengthen your days.\r\nFrom your brother.\r\n\r\n                                                 \"ASAAD ESH SHIDIAK.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter is certainly genuine, and is a full proof of what nature the\r\ninsanity is, under which he labours. It has greatly relieved the anxiety\r\nwe felt from the report of yesterday.\r\n\r\nFrom the verbal account, given by the lad who brought the letter, the\r\nfollowing are selected as the most important particulars. He entered the\r\nconvent on his arrival, and seeing nobody but the keeper of the\r\nprison-room, obtained leave to go in, and see Asaad alone. He found him\r\nsitting on the bare floor, _with a heavy chain around his neck, and\r\nfirmly fastened at the other end into the wall_. His bed had been\r\nremoved together with all his books and writing materials, and (what is\r\nconsidered here the extreme of privation,) he was left without a pipe.\r\n\r\nThe lad continued with him an hour or two, without being discovered by\r\nany one but the keeper. During the conversation, Asaad observed, that\r\nnot long since he was sent to Koshia, as a man possessed of a devil, and\r\nthat he escaped from that place and had arrived near Tripoli, when he\r\nwas taken by a party of Maronites, and brought back to the patriarch. He\r\nhad, since that time, been kept regularly at Cannobeen, subject\r\noccasionally to beating and insult, from such as might call in to see\r\nthe heretic. We understood the man to say, that the patriarch even\r\ninstructed the common people to spit in his face, and call him by odious\r\nnames, in order to shame him into submission. Asaad gave his advice that\r\nwe should either send some one with a horse, and get him away by\r\nstealth, or get the consul to interfere by writing to the pasha. The\r\nletter written by Asaad was done through the contrivance of his keeper\r\nfor a small reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Attempts made to procure his release._\r\n\r\nAfter hearing all this, we went directly to the consul to inform him of\r\nthe case, and to urge him to an interference. He consented, that we\r\nshould first procure some one to write a firm and consistent letter to\r\nthe patriarch, demanding by what right he had taken a man from an\r\nEnglish employer, and under English protection, and imprisoned him\r\nunheard, &c. intimating, that if the man was not soon given up,\r\nsomething more would be done.\r\n\r\nToward evening, J. came again to inquire what we had concluded on. When\r\nhe found what step we had taken, he seemed much alarmed for his own\r\nsafety, and begged us not to proceed, for he should be immediately\r\nsuspected as the mediator of the affair, and should be in danger of\r\nbeing persecuted as such. He mentioned, as a justification of his fears,\r\nthat the keeper overheard Asaad when he recommended that course to his\r\nbrother, and that the keeper, when inquired of, would of course mention\r\nthe fact to the patriarch. Instead of the measure we were about taking,\r\nhe recommended to apply to the emir, through one of his relatives, who\r\nwas our mutual friend, and to this we consented. It is, however,\r\nprobable, that the object of J. is not so much to avoid danger, as to\r\nput his friend the emir in a way to get a small present.\r\n\r\n5. J. has been to see the emir, in order to persuade him to intercede\r\nwith his uncle, the emir Beshir, but the former was not at home, and\r\ntherefore the latter was not consulted. J. then went to the emir M. but\r\nfound him quite averse to do any thing, saying, that to liberate a man,\r\nwho had become English, would never do. He next saw Mansoor, the\r\nbrother, and asked him if he knew that Asaad was in close confinement.\r\n\"Yes,\" answered he, \"and he may end his days there, unless he can learn\r\nto behave himself better.\" One characteristic mark of a heathen is, that\r\nhe is \"_without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful_.\"\r\n\r\nJ. says, that his brother has told him in addition, that Asaad himself,\r\non the whole, wished not to have the consul interfere, but that some one\r\nmight, for the present, be sent every week or two, to see how he got\r\nalong, and in the mean time, he hoped to make his own escape, for that\r\nonly a few days before, he had loosed himself from his chains, and got\r\nout of the convent, but not understanding the path, he became afraid to\r\nproceed, and returned of his own accord.\r\n\r\n6. Went again to confer with the consul with regard to Asaad. When we\r\nmentioned the fact, that Asaad was under a sort of oath of obedience to\r\nthe patriarch, an agreement which all make who are educated from the\r\nfunds of the Ain Warka college, he seemed to think differently of the\r\ncase, because, though an oath to bind the conscience, as in this case,\r\ncan never be binding, and is neither acknowledged by Turks or English,\r\nyet, in the opinion of all Maronites, it justifies what the patriarch\r\nhas done. This English protection, they would say, is of no avail, since\r\nhe was under a previous engagement to serve the patriarch. The consul\r\nthinks the case, if presented to the chief emir, would be rejected\r\nwithout consideration, on the ground, that it was ecclesiastical, and\r\nnot civil; and if presented to the pasha, he would exact fines from many\r\ninnocent convents, and other wise oppress them, without perhaps, after\r\nall, procuring the release of the prisoner. He would prefer some secret\r\nmode of effecting the object.\r\n\r\nPriest Bernardus, of Gzir, already mentioned was on a visit to the\r\nfamily below, and sent up to beg the favour of a sight at Shidiak's\r\nstatement. I at first refused, but on a second application, and being\r\nassured that the priest was a friend of Shidiak, I consented, and\r\ninvited the man to come and take with me a cup of coffee, which he did.\r\nIt will be observed, that this Bernardus was one of those, who wished\r\nShidiak to say that his faith was like that of the Roman catholic\r\nchurch, although it should be a falsehood, saying that the patriarch\r\nwould bestow on him a pardon for the lie. The priest acknowledged to the\r\nfamily below, that Shidiak's statement of that affair was correct.\r\n\r\n14. Received a line from the friendly Maronite bishop, to whom I had\r\nwritten, (April 8,) who says that he has been assured, probably afresh,\r\nthat Shidiak is in prison, and suffers beating.\r\n\r\n15. The emir A. came and conversed a length of time on the case of\r\nShidiak. I offered to reward him well for his trouble, if he would\r\nprocure his release, which he has promised to attempt.\r\n\r\n21. J. came to say, that he had never seen the emir A. who had\r\nendeavoured to persuade his uncle to write to the patriarch. The uncle,\r\nhowever, refused, but added, \"_You_ may write in my name, and say, that\r\nit is my pleasure, that Shidiak should be liberated.\" The messenger has,\r\ntherefore, gone with such a letter.\r\n\r\n22. This morning, came Tannoos Shidiak, accompanied by a young emir,\r\nsaying, that they had knowledge of our attempt to liberate Asaad,\r\nthrough the medium of the emir A. \"It will not do,\" said he, \"you will\r\nnot accomplish your object so.\" They both said, that the emir A. was a\r\ngreat liar, had a little mind, and little, if any, influence with his\r\nuncle. In short, _they_ proposed _a more excellent way_, viz. that we\r\nshould give _them_ also a good reward to engage in this noble work of\r\nbrotherly love.\r\n\r\n24. The messenger from the emir A. arrived from Cannobeen, with the\r\nfollowing letter from the patriarch, in answer to his own.\r\n\r\n\"After kissing the hands of your honourable excellency, &c. &c. With\r\nregard to your slave, _Asaad Esh Shidiak_, the state into which he is\r\nfallen, is not unknown to your excellency. His understanding is\r\nsubverted. In some respects he is a demoniac, in others not. Every day\r\nhis malady increases upon him, until I have been obliged to take severe\r\nmeasures with him, and put him under keepers, lest he should escape from\r\nhere, and grow worse, and infuse his poison into others. Two days ago,\r\nhe succeeded in getting away in the night, and obliged me to send men to\r\nbind him and bring him back; and after he was come, he showed signs of\r\nreturning sanity, and begged to be forgiven. But he does not abide by\r\nhis word, for he is very fickle; and the most probable opinion\r\nrespecting him is, that he is possessed of the devil. However, as he\r\nwas, to appearance, disposed to yield me obedience, I treated him kindly\r\nand humanely, and used every means to promote his permanent cure. This\r\nis what I have to communicate to your excellency, and the bearer will\r\ninform you further. Whatever your excellency commands, I obey, and the\r\nLord lengthen your life.\r\n\r\n                                     JOSEPH, _Patriarch of Antioch._\"\r\n\r\n27. A youth from Ain Warka informed us, that he had seen a letter in\r\nAsaad's own hand-writing, saying, that he had yielded obedience to the\r\npatriarch, and professed again the faith of the Roman catholic church.\r\nThis report, excited great joy, he says, at the college. We are rather\r\npained by the news, because, if Asaad has done this, we are almost sure\r\nit has been done insincerely, and merely to escape the pains of his\r\npersecution. The same person says, that a relative of the patriarch at\r\nCannobeen, has been in the habit of writing, every week or two, to the\r\ncollege, to give the news of what was done with Asaad from time to time,\r\nin which he spoke of his _chains_ and _stripes_, and so on. He also\r\nobserves, that many people have boldly questioned the right of the\r\npatriarch to proceed to such extremities with the members of his church,\r\nsaying, they saw not, at this rate, which was chief governor of the\r\nmountains, the prince, or the patriarch.\r\n\r\n_July 1._ One who seemed certain of delivering Shidiak, if he should set\r\nabout it, went, with our recommendation to Tripoli, from which place he\r\nhopes to have a convenient communication with Cannobeen.\r\n\r\n14. The youth who went to Tripoli to attempt something, came back\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\n17. Application has been made by Phares to the emir M., but he refused\r\nto do any thing for Asaad, alleging that it is an affair of religion,\r\nand belongs exclusively to the patriarch. Phares says, that\r\nnotwithstanding the superstition and anger, which his mother exhibited\r\nwhen here, she has more than once said, that the English are better than\r\nthe Maronites, for they take an interest in the fate of Asaad, while the\r\nMaronites all seem to care nothing about him, whether he is dead or\r\nalive, happy or wretched.\r\n\r\nPhares, as well as others, says, that Tannoos is Asaad's enemy from\r\njealousy. Asaad is younger than Tannoos, but has been much more noticed.\r\nThis Tannoos could not bear, and has therefore been quite willing to see\r\nhim disgraced and punished.\r\n\r\nPhares observes, that Tannoos was quite as favourably disposed to\r\nprotestant principles as Asaad, but the moment Asaad took the start of\r\nhim, he fell back, and is a much firmer Maronite than ever. He seemed to\r\nbe affected at the death of Mr. Fisk, but inferred from it, that God did\r\nnot approve the efforts of the protestants in this country. The death of\r\nMr. Dalton, also, his former pupil, probably confirmed this feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great difficulties in the way of Asaad's release._\r\n\r\n18. Tannoos came to converse about his brother Asaad. He had just\r\nreceived a letter in Asaad's own hand-writing, saying, that he was\r\nreduced to a great extremity of distress, and perhaps had not long to\r\nlive, and begging Tannoos to come up and see if nothing could be done to\r\nend or mitigate his sufferings. Tannoos declares that he would be very\r\nglad to get him away from Cannobeen, if he could be safe, but that in\r\nany other place in the dominions of the emir Beshir, he would be killed.\r\nHe might be safe at the consul's, but with me, he would _not_ be. \"There\r\nare men in these mountains,\" said he, \"that can kill and _have_ killed\r\npatriarchs and emirs, and that in their own houses; and why could they\r\nnot kill Asaad with you, if they chose? Is your house more secure than\r\nthe convent of the patriarch, or the palace of the emir? A man in\r\nentering your house, would violate all law, but the English would not\r\nmake war for the killing of a single man.\"\r\n\r\nI observed, that an application would very possibly be made to the\r\npasha, by the consul, if Asaad was not soon delivered up. \"An\r\napplication of that sort,\" replied T. \"would be quite useless. The pasha\r\nwould send the application to the emir, and do you not think the emir\r\nwould arrange the affair as he pleased? He knows well this sort of\r\ndealing. He has known how to manage these mountains for forty years, and\r\ndo you think he would be at a loss about such a trifle as this? For\r\nexample, what would be more easy for the emir, if he chose to detain the\r\nman, than to say he had committed murder, and therefore could not be\r\ngiven up?\" \"But,\" said I, \"such a charge must be established by\r\ncompetent witnesses, and under the consul's inspection.\" \"True,\" replied\r\nhe, \"and where would be the difficulty in that? _The emir would bring\r\n500 witnesses to-morrow to establish any crime he was pleased to\r\nallege._ And as to his fearing the pasha, though he holds his office\r\nunder him, yet his power is even superior to the pasha's.\"----\"The\r\npatriarch,\" continued Tannoos, \"can do just what he chooses, in spite of\r\nthe English. You have brought books here, and the patriarch has burned\r\nthem in spite of you. He has issued to all denominations a proclamation\r\nfull of lies against you, and what have you been able to do? You have\r\nindeed written a reply to the proclamation, and hold it up to the\r\npeople, and say, 'Look how the patriarch lies about us;' but what does\r\nhe care for all that.\"\r\n\r\nSo talks a Lebanon mountaineer, of more sense, information and truth,\r\nthan most others, respecting the moral character and godly fear of his\r\npatriarch and prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n_His family attempt his liberation._\r\n\r\n19. Phares brought us a letter, which had just been received by the\r\nfamily at Hadet, from the patriarch, wishing them to come immediately to\r\nCannobeen. Tannoos and his mother have gone, and intend, if possible, to\r\nbring Asaad away, either to Kesroan, or to Hadet. The mother insisted on\r\ngoing, and wished to pass through Beyroot on her way, that she might\r\nconsult us before she went; but this was not permitted her.\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned letter, in English, runs thus:--\"After telling you\r\nhow much I desire to see you in all health and prosperity, I send you\r\nnews respecting the wretch Asaad Esh Shidiak, otherwise called _lord of\r\nhell_. His obduracy, with which you are acquainted, has exceedingly\r\nincreased. It is not unknown to you, how much care I have bestowed on\r\nhim for his good, how much I have laboured for his salvation, and under\r\nwhat severe discipline I have put him; and all to no effect. And now, as\r\nmight be expected, he has fallen ill, and therefore can no longer run\r\naway, according to his custom, and we have been thus constrained to take\r\noff the severity of our treatment. But fearing lest his disease should\r\nincrease upon him, I have sent you word, that you may come and see how\r\nhe is, and consult what is best to be done with him. Make no delay,\r\ntherefore, in coming, and the apostolic blessing be upon you.\"\r\n\r\nThis attempt of his family to effect his liberation failed, for some\r\nreason unknown; and he continued immured in prison, suffering\r\npersecution. He was confined in a small room with an iron collar round\r\nhis neck fastened to the wall with a strong chain. In October, 1826,\r\nanother attempt was made to effect the liberation of Asaad. The civil\r\nauthorities were consulted, but could not be prevailed upon to enlist in\r\nhis behalf. In November, 1826, however, he effected his escape, but was\r\nsoon arrested, and treated more cruelly than ever.\r\n\r\nIn the Herald for April, 1828, we find the following history of Asaad\r\nfrom the time he was betrayed into the hands of the patriarch till the\r\nspring of 1826. It is thus prefaced by Mr. Bird, one of the\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\n\"This account of our suffering friend, though by no means complete, may\r\nnevertheless be relied on as authentic, and is by far the most full and\r\nsatisfactory account which we have been able to obtain. It was sent us,\r\nas you will see in the journal, by the friendly young shekh, Naami\r\nLatoof, who, some time previous, spent a few weeks in our families, and\r\nwhose heart seems to have been touched with the truths of the gospel.\r\nThe priest, who has proved so great a benefactor to Asaad, is a relative\r\nof the shekh, and they have grown up together from childhood on the most\r\nintimate terms of familiarity and friendship. Many of the occurrences\r\nhere related, the priest found written among the monks, who pass their\r\ntime idly with the patriarch, and to many he was an eye-witness. The\r\naccount was drawn up under his own inspection. He seems a man unusually\r\nconscientious for an Arab, unusually open to conviction in argument, and\r\nhas promised to do his utmost to save Asaad from further abuse, and in\r\nthe end to deliver him from his state of confinement. Thus, while all\r\nour own efforts have failed of essentially benefitting the poor man, the\r\nLord, without any of our instrumentality, has raised up a friend from\r\nthe midst of his persecutors, who has already saved him from impending\r\ndeath, and we hope and pray, will soon open the way for his complete\r\ndeliverance from this Syrian Inquisition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brief history of Asaad Esh Shidiak, from the time of his being betrayed\r\ninto the hands of the Maronite Patriarch, in the spring of 1826._\r\n\r\n=Translated from the Arabic of Naami Latoof.=\r\n\r\nWhen the relatives of Asaad brought him to the convent of Alma in the\r\ndistrict of Kesroan, and gave him up to the patriarch, the latter began\r\nby way of flattery to promise him all the worldly advantages he could\r\nbestow; but withal demanding that he should put away all the heretical\r\nnotions, and all the corrupt knowledge, which the Bible-men, those\r\nenemies of the pope, had taught him. He replied, \"These things which you\r\nhold out to me, are to me of no value. I no longer trouble myself about\r\nthem, for they are vain and of short duration. Every christian is bound\r\nto think, and labour, and strive to be accounted worthy to hear that\r\nblessed welcome, 'Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom\r\nprepared for you from the foundation of the world.' As to rejecting from\r\nmy mind those things which I have learned from the Bible-men, I have to\r\nsay, that, for many years, I had read, occasionally, the holy\r\nscriptures, which are able to make us wise unto salvation, but could not\r\nlive according to them; for I was given to the indulgence of all wicked\r\npassions: but since my acquaintance with these men, I see myself,\r\nthrough the merits of my Saviour, possessed of a new heart, though it is\r\nnot yet, I confess, in all respects such as I could wish it to be.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the few days they remained in the Kesroan, the patriarch shewed\r\nhim every attention, and suffered no one to oppose his opinions saying,\r\n\"The protestants, by the great sums they have given him, have blinded\r\nhis eyes, and inclined him to join them, and diffuse their poisonous\r\nsentiments, so that he cannot, at once, be brought to leave them. Let\r\nhim alone for the present, do nothing to oppose or to offend him, until\r\nwe shall arrive at Cannobeen, where we may examine into his faith and\r\nstate at our leisure, and if we find that he still clings to his heresy,\r\nwe then can do with him as circumstances may require.\" After a short\r\ntime they proceeded with him to Cannobeen, and there began to use\r\narguments to convince him of his errors, and persuade him to confess and\r\nforsake them, and embrace whatever the councils and the church had\r\nenacted;--requiring that he should surrender his conscience to the holy\r\ncatholic church, and bless all whom she blessed, and curse all whom she\r\ncursed; and this they did in the most stern and threatening manner. He\r\nreplied, \"It has been said, by the mouth of the Holy One, _Bless and\r\ncurse not._\" They still pressed him to yield his opinions, but he said,\r\n\"I can give up nothing, nor can I believe any thing but as it is written\r\nin the holy scriptures; for in these is contained all doctrines\r\nnecessary to salvation.\"--\"But,\" said they, \"is every thing then,\r\nworthless, that has been ordained by the councils and the fathers?\" He\r\nanswered, \"The councils may have enacted laws good for themselves, but\r\nwe are not bound to follow them.\"\r\n\r\nAfter urging him, day after day, to no purpose, they finally asked in\r\ndespair, \"Are you then still of the same sentiment?\" \"Of the same\r\nsentiment,\" said he; \"I still believe and hold whatever is written in\r\nthe holy scriptures, and neither more nor less.\" \"Will every one, then,\r\nwho reads the gospel, be saved?\" \"By no means;--but as it is written,\r\n'he that hath my commands and _keepeth_ them, he it is that loveth me.'\"\r\n\"It is the duty of every person to possess the gospel, and read it?\"\r\n\"Yes, it is the duty of every one. 'For,' said Paul, 'if our gospel be\r\nhid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the god of this world hath\r\nblinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the\r\nglorious gospel should shine unto them.'\" They then reviled him, and\r\nspurned him away from their sight, and began to meditate measures of\r\nviolence against him. He was separated from all around him, and\r\ncompelled to take his meals by himself; and lest he should attempt to\r\nescape, a person was set over him to keep him under a constant watch. He\r\nwas made to feel himself in the lowest state of disgrace, all taking the\r\nfullest liberty to reproach and ridicule him.\r\n\r\nFrom this state of debasement he soon began to meditate his escape.\r\nAccordingly, one evening, just as the sun had set, and while his\r\nkeeper's eye was off him, he fled. An immediate and diligent search was\r\nmade for him, but he could not be found until the second day, when he\r\nwas discovered still hiding in a grove near by, for he was totally\r\nignorant of the way he ought to take. They brought him immediately to\r\nthe patriarch. When he arrived, he was met by reproaches and revilings,\r\nand the servants, by order of the patriarch beat him, and put him into\r\nconfinement. This was at Diman, a pleasant, airy situation belonging to\r\nCannobeen, and about an hour's distance from it. Soon after this, he was\r\ntaken up to the latter place, when he was left a little more at large,\r\nbut was always under the watch of a keeper.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when all had gone in the chapel for prayers, he lay as if\r\nhe had been asleep, and the monk, his keeper, thinking him really so,\r\nwent in with the rest, but took with him, as a precaution, Asaad's\r\nsilver inkhorn, supposing that if he should wake, and think of escaping,\r\nhe would not be willing to leave behind him so valuable an article. When\r\nAsaad saw that all were gone, knowing the length of their prayers, he at\r\nonce left the convent, and ran about an hour's distance. People were\r\ndespatched in search of him with all diligence, but they returned\r\nwithout finding him. On account of his ignorance of the way, he remained\r\nsecreted near the road till the day broke, when he continued his flight\r\nuntil he had reached the distance of three hours or more from his\r\nprison, when a couple of men in the service of the patriarch, having\r\nbeen apprized of his escape by the pursuers during the night, discovered\r\nhim, and called out, \"Who are you? Are you Asaad?\" He replied, \"I am\r\nAsaad.\" They at once took him into custody, and brought him back, but\r\nwithout any violence or indignity, to the patriarch. A different\r\ntreatment, however, awaited him at the convent. He had no sooner reached\r\nit, than they covered him with insult, beating him, and mocking him, and\r\nsaying, \"fool that you are, why did you answer to your name?\" He\r\nreplied, \"God has laid a curse upon the lying mouth, and therefore I\r\ncannot use it.\" They said, \"If you do not return to your faith, and hold\r\nto all that has been ordained by the church and the fathers, you are\r\nruined. You will die under your tortures, and go to perdition.\" He\r\nreplied, \"Whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. I\r\nam willing to expose myself to every indignity and suffering for the\r\nsake of Him who loved us, and shed his precious blood for our salvation.\r\nThese things I am bound to say and do, and I am bound to exhort you\r\nalso, as beloved friends.\" When he had said this, they all laughed him\r\nto scorn, called him a madman, and were about to beat him for\r\nattempting, as they pretended, to make heretics of them also. When he\r\nsaw their anger, he cried out, \"Why are you enraged at me, and what are\r\nyou about to do to me? I am a dying man like yourselves, and preach unto\r\nyou that you should turn from your vanities unto the living God, who\r\nmade heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that are therein.\" They\r\nthen renewed their cries that he was mad, and thrust him into his prison\r\nroom, and locked the door upon him, and strict orders were given that no\r\none should say any thing to him more or less. In this state he remained\r\nfor some days. The patriarch then sent to him to inquire after his\r\nfaith, especially respecting his trust in the images of the church,\r\ndeclaring to him that without faith in these, he could not be saved. He\r\nreplied, \"Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility\r\nand worshipping of angels.\" They brought him proofs from the councils,\r\nthat images were used by the fathers, and ought to be set up and\r\nworshipped in the churches, in honour of the saints, and to obtain their\r\nintercession. He answered, \"I will also bring you proof from the\r\ncouncils, that the worship of images, and all use of them in the\r\nchurches, was forbidden and reprobated by the fathers.\" Here they\r\ncontradicted him. \"Be it as it may,\" said he, \"it is impossible for me\r\nto follow the opinions of any man or set of men., and leave the word of\r\nGod behind me. This word tells me, that 'forasmuch as we are the\r\noffspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto\r\ngold, or silver, or stone, graven by art or man's device.'\" The\r\nmessengers then quit him, and made their report to the patriarch, who\r\nleft him in his prison for a considerable time, in the most abject and\r\nsuffering state.\r\n\r\nIn process of time, certain individuals, possessed of a little humanity,\r\nbecame interested in his situation, sympathized in his sufferings,\r\ninterceded for him, and procured liberty to open the prison door, so\r\nthat any one who chose could go in and see him without restraint. Again\r\nhe began to meditate an attempt to escape, and on a certain evening, set\r\noff from the convent. But, as before, his ignorance of the proper path\r\nto escape in, prevented the accomplishment of his purpose. He soon saw\r\nthe lighted torches streaming off in every direction in search of him,\r\nand to avoid his pursuers, turned aside a short distance, and climbed\r\ninto a tree. From this situation he did not dare to come down till the\r\nnight was fairly gone, when he shifted the position of his clothes,\r\nturning his cloak inside out, using his turban for a girdle and his\r\ngirdle for a turban, and took his way. He had, however, not proceeded\r\nfar, when one of the patriarch's men discovered him, and called out,\r\n\"Asaad is it you?\" He answered, \"it is I.\" The man immediately caught\r\nhim, like a greedy wolf, bound him, beat him, and drove him before him,\r\nas a slave, or a brute, to Cannobeen. On their way they were met by many\r\nothers who had been sent off in quest of him, who all united with the\r\ncaptor in his brutal treatment. On his arrival, the patriarch gave\r\nimmediate orders for his punishment, and they fell upon him with\r\nreproaches, caning him and smiting him with their hands; and so it was,\r\nthat as often as they struck him on one cheek, he turned to them the\r\nother also. \"This,\" said he, \"is a joyful day to me. My blessed Lord and\r\nMaster has said, 'Bless them that curse you, and if they strike you on\r\nthe right cheek turn to them the left also.' This I have been enabled to\r\ndo, and I am ready to suffer even more than this for him, who was\r\nbeaten, and spit upon, and led as a sheep to the slaughter, on our\r\naccount.\" When they heard this, they fell to beating him anew saying,\r\n\"Have we need of your preaching, thou deceiver? Of what avail are such\r\npretensions in one who is in the broad way to perdition?\" He replied,\r\n\"he that believeth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, hath eternal\r\nlife.\" \"Ah,\" said they, \"this is what blinds you. Your salvation is _by\r\nfaith alone in Christ_; thus you cast contempt on his mother, and his\r\nsaints; you deny the presence of his holy body on earth;\"--and they\r\nthrew him on the ground, overwhelmed with the multitude of their blows.\r\nFor three successive days, he was subjected to the bastinado, by order\r\nof the patriarch, who, after that, summoned him to his presence, and\r\ndemanded of him his faith. \"I am a Christian, a follower of Jesus of\r\nNazareth.\" Those present exhorted him to acknowledge the intercession of\r\nthe saints, and to repair to them for help in this hour of trial. But he\r\nrefused, saying, \"My help is in him who shed his blood for sinners.\"\r\n\"But have the saints,\" said they, \"no intercession, and is it vain to\r\nworship them, and pray to them?\" He said, \"We are not taught to seek\r\nhelp or protection from any, but from him who is the Great Shepherd, who\r\nhas said with his own blessed mouth, 'Come unto me, all ye that labour\r\nand are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' To any other than God,\r\nwe are not commanded to pray or seek for refuge.\"\r\n\r\nThey then returned him to his prison as before. Those who sympathized\r\nwith him, went and begged him to confess that the canons of the councils\r\nwere binding on all Christians, and that the images were very properly\r\nmade use of in the churches. He answered, \"Professing themselves to be\r\nwise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God\r\ninto an image made like unto corruptible man.\" At this they turned away\r\nfrom him in despair and disgust, and reported to the patriarch that he\r\nwas in the most settled state of obstinacy, and was doubtless possessed\r\nof a devil.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the patriarch ordered him to be put in chains, and the door\r\nto be barred upon him, as formerly, and his food to be given him in\r\nshort allowance. In this condition he remained till he was much reduced,\r\nand began to entreat them to have pity on him and take off the irons\r\nfrom his feet, and open the door of his prison. Some were moved by his\r\nsupplications, interceded for him, unbarred the door, took off his\r\nchains, and left him. He arose, walked out, and sat down with one of\r\nthem and conversed. He then begged the patriarch to give him some books\r\nto copy, to rid himself of the tedium of his idleness. But he refused,\r\nnor would he suffer any to hold conversation with him.\r\n\r\nAfter some days, there came into the convent two men, in the character\r\nof beggars, and wished to pass the night, but were turned away. That\r\nsame night Asaad made another attempt to escape. As soon as it was\r\ndiscovered that he was gone, a vigorous search was made to find him, but\r\nall to no purpose. The universal cry now was, that the two men already\r\nmentioned had been sent by the protestants to steal him away for a large\r\nreward. Immediately his holiness, the patriarch, sent letters to the\r\nemeer Abdallah informing him of Asaad's escape, and requesting him to\r\nguard the roads of the Kesroan, and search the neighbourhood, if\r\npossibly Asaad might still be found lurking in that district.\r\nAccordingly search was made, Asaad was discovered among his relatives by\r\na couple of soldiers, was bound, and taken off to the emeer, who sent\r\nhim direct to the patriarch.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival, he was loaded with chains, cast into a dark, filthy\r\nroom, and bastinadoed, every day, for eight days, sometimes fainting\r\nunder the operation, until he was near death. He was then left in his\r\nmisery, his bed a thin flag mat, his covering his common clothes. The\r\ndoor of his prison was filled up with stone and mortar, and his food was\r\nsix thin cakes of bread a day, and a scanty cup of water. In this\r\nloathsome dungeon, from which there was no access but a small loop hole,\r\nthrough which they passed his food, he lay for several days; and he\r\nwould lift up his voice, and cry, \"Love ye the Lord Jesus Christ\r\naccording as he hath loved us, and given himself to die for us. Think of\r\nme, O ye that pass by, have pity upon me, and deliver me from these\r\nsufferings.\"\r\n\r\nNow when his groans and cries were thus heard, a certain priest, who had\r\nbeen a former friend of Asaad, was touched with compassion. His former\r\nfriendship revived, his bowels yearned over his suffering brother, and\r\nhe besought every one who could speak with the patriarch, that they\r\nwould intercede and endeavour to soften his feelings towards his\r\nprisoner. By dint of perseverance, the priest at length succeeded, and\r\nobtained permission to open the prison door of his friend and take off\r\nhis irons. The first request he made of the priest on his entering, was,\r\nthat he would give him a little food, for he was famishing with hunger.\r\nThe priest immediately brought him a little bread and cooked victuals,\r\nwhich he ate, and said, \"The name of the Lord be blessed.\"\r\n\r\nThose present began to exhort him to turn to the mother of God, if,\r\nperadventure, she would have mercy upon him, and bring him back to the\r\nway of salvation. He answered, \"If she has the power of intercession,\r\nlet her intercede for us with her beloved Son.\" The priest was very\r\nassiduous in supplying him with every thing necessary for his comfort;\r\nin particular he obtained the return of his clothes, of which he had\r\nbeen partly stripped; for the snow was upon the ground, and the cold\r\nfilled him with pains.\r\n\r\nNow when the others saw the care and attention of the priest, they said,\r\n\"You have become a convert to his heretical opinions.\" But he replied,\r\n\"God has said, 'Blessed are the merciful;'\" and continued firm in his\r\npurpose. His assiduity was such, that whenever he left the convent for\r\nany time, he would give money to the cook to prevail on him to supply\r\nAsaad with proper food, and to attend upon him in whatever he might\r\nneed. The enemies of the priest accused him to the patriarch, but they\r\ncould not succeed in their object, for the priest is of blameless\r\nmorals, and has a good name among all.\r\n\r\nThe priest now passed much of his time in company with Asaad, and\r\nconversed with him freely. On a certain occasion they began to converse\r\non the subject of the cross, the priest saying it ought to be\r\nworshipped. Asaad replied, \"For what reason? and where is the use of\r\nit?\" The priest said, \"In memory of the Saviour.\" Asaad,--\"Why do you\r\nkiss the cross, and who has commanded it?\" Priest,--\"We kiss it in\r\nhonour of him who hung upon it.\" Asaad.--\"But why then do you not paint\r\nthe _ass_ also, and pay it all obeisance, and all honours, for our\r\nSaviour, when he rode upon the ass, was in all honour, and all paid him\r\nobeisance; but when he was on the cross, he was in sorrow and disgrace.\"\r\nThe priest reproved him gently for returning such an answer, and when he\r\nsaw that the priest was displeased, he said, \"On account of your love to\r\nme, and the favour you have done me, I wish to prove to you this point,\r\nthat all religious reverence and worship and service to any but God, is\r\nvain; for it is said, 'He that heareth my word, and believeth on him\r\nthat sent me, hath everlasting life,' and I have to beg of you, that you\r\nwill continually search the holy scriptures, and pray as David prayed,\r\n'Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within\r\nme.'\" During this time, one of their enemies was standing without the\r\ndoor, and listened to the whole conversation. This man went immediately,\r\nto the patriarch, and told him all that he had heard, and that the\r\npriest was conversing with Asaad in so gentle a manner, that he was\r\nlikely soon to be won over to heresy. His holiness was startled at the\r\nintelligence, and hastening down inquired the truth of the report. Asaad\r\nconcealed nothing. The patriarch, however, at first, repressed his own\r\nfeelings, and exhorted him in the most winning manner he could assume,\r\npromising that if he would but return to the holy church and fathers and\r\ncouncils, worship the images, and saints, and the mother of God, he\r\nwould again immediately make him his secretary. He replied, \"With regard\r\nto the opinions which I hold, I assure you I wish to hold none which are\r\nopposed to the word of God; and as to resorting to the virgin Mary, I\r\nsay, as I have before said, that if she has any power of intercession,\r\nlet her intercede for us. As to giving up my opinions to the church and\r\ncouncils, how can I do it, so long as I am possessed of satisfactory\r\nevidence that these councils are opposed to one another? We are in no\r\nneed of the councils, but have sufficient light without them to guide us\r\nin the way of salvation. Moreover I can say, that _I do_ surrender my\r\nopinions to the holy catholic church, for I profess the faith of the\r\nchurch of Christ, and unite my conscience with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe patriarch could no longer restrain his feelings, but broke out in\r\nthe language of reproach, saying, \"You are a worthless fellow,\r\nobstinately bent on maintaining your folly. I give you to understand\r\nthat I am clear of your guilt. You will not be taught, but love to shew\r\nyour contempt of the cross, and of the worship of the images, whose\r\nworship is only in honour of those to whose memory they are set up, and\r\nwho laboured and died in the service of Christ.\" Asaad replied, \"With\r\nregard to worshipping such things as these, it is said, 'Thou shalt\r\nworship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve;' and as to\r\nthose who laboured and shed their blood for the Saviour, they are above\r\nour honours, for they have gone to inherit unspeakable glory in their\r\nmaster's presence.\" The patriarch was more angry than ever, and taking\r\noff his slipper, beat both him and the priest, and drove the latter from\r\nthe room, and locked the door.\r\n\r\nAfter six days of additional confinement, the friendly priest again\r\nprocured his release from his prison, and obtained the favour of taking\r\nthe entire oversight of him. In this condition the persecuted man\r\nremains. May the Most High grant him speedy deliverance.\r\n\r\n  Feb. 15th, 1827.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe latest accounts from Palestine state that Asaad is still in\r\nconfinement, but remains firm to the principles he has embraced. In a\r\nletter from Mr. Goodell, dated April, 1830, we find the following\r\nsentence.--\"_Asaad Shidiak is still alive, and there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that he loves and obeys the truth, that he is sanctified by it,\r\nrooted and grounded in it, and ready to suffer for it._\" We take our\r\nleave of this interesting narrative, commending the suffering subject of\r\nit to God, and the word of his grace, accounting him more blessed if he\r\nperseveres steadfast unto the end, than if his brows were endowed with\r\nan imperial diadem.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[E] The Papists receive these books as of equal divine authority with\r\nthe books of the Old Testament.--ED.\r\n\r\n[F] This he actually proposed, but the patriarch would not listen to the\r\nproposal a moment.\r\n\r\n[G] \"He causeth all--to receive a mark,\" &c. \"and no man might buy or\r\nsell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast.\" The patriarch\r\nwas also clothed in scarlet, like the woman on the scarlet coloured\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\n[H] See Rev. xiii. 13\r\n\r\n[I] When he first came to Beyroot, this same sentence was dictated to\r\nhim, and it appeared in his eyes so much like blasphemy, that he refused\r\nto write it.\r\n\r\n[J] We afterwards ascertained, that he was decoyed off to a distance, as\r\nif for walk, and when he would have returned, was prevented by force.\r\n\r\n[K] This letter was a mere tissue of testimonies, brought from the\r\nfathers, and from the scriptures, condemning the worship of images.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPERSECUTIONS OF THE BAPTIST MISSIONARIES IN INDIA, DURING THE YEAR 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Account of the Scenes at Ava during the War._\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Judson were among the number of the first missionaries who\r\nleft this country for India. After labouring for some time in Hindostan\r\nthey finally established themselves at Rangoon in the Burman Empire, in\r\n1813. In 1824 war broke out between the British East India Company and\r\nthe emperor of Burmah. Mr. and Mrs. Judson and Dr. Price, who were at\r\nAva, the capital of the Burman Empire, when the war commenced, were\r\nimmediately arrested and confined for several months. The account of the\r\nsufferings of the missionaries was written by Mrs. Judson, and is given\r\nin her own words.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the missionaries, during this long and disastrous\r\nperiod, surpassed all that the most alarmed and fertile imagination had\r\nconceived. Of the dreadful scenes at Ava, a minute account was written\r\nby Mrs. Judson to Dr. Elnathan Judson. It will be read with strong and\r\npainful interest. Fiction itself has seldom invented a tale more replete\r\nwith terror.\r\n\r\n        \"_Rangoon, May 26, 1826._\r\n\r\n\"My beloved Brother,\r\n\r\n\"I commence this letter with the intention of giving you the particulars\r\nof our captivity and sufferings at Ava. How long my patience will allow\r\nmy reviewing scenes of disgust and horror, the conclusion of this\r\nletter will determine. I had kept a journal of every thing that had\r\ntranspired from our arrival at Ava, but destroyed it at the commencement\r\nof our difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"The first certain intelligence we received of the declaration of war by\r\nthe Burmese, was on our arrival at Tsenpyoo-kywon, about a hundred miles\r\nthis side of Ava, where part of the troops, under the command of the\r\ncelebrated Bandoola, had encamped. As we proceeded on our journey, we\r\nmet Bandoola himself, with the remainder of his troops, gaily equipped,\r\nseated on his golden barge, and surrounded by a fleet of gold war boats,\r\none of which was instantly despatched the other side of the river to\r\nhail us, and make all necessary inquiries. We were allowed to proceed\r\nquietly on, when he had informed the messenger that we were Americans,\r\n_not English_, and were going to Ava in obedience to the command of his\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\n\"On our arrival at the capital, we found that Dr. Price was out of\r\nfavour at court, and that suspicion rested on most of the foreigners\r\nthen at Ava. Your brother visited at the palace two or three times, but\r\nfound the king's manner toward him very different from what it formerly\r\nhad been; and the queen, who had hitherto expressed wishes for my speedy\r\narrival, now made no inquiries after me, nor intimated a wish to see me.\r\nConsequently, I made no effort to visit at the palace, though almost\r\ndaily invited to visit some of the branches of the royal family, who\r\nwere living in their own houses, out of the palace enclosure. Under\r\nthese circumstances, we thought our most prudent course lay in\r\nprosecuting our original intention of building a house, and commencing\r\nmissionary operations as occasion offered, thus endeavouring to convince\r\nthe government that we had really nothing to do with the present war.\r\n\r\n\"In two or three weeks after our arrival, the king, queen, all the\r\nmembers of the royal family, and most of the officers of government,\r\nreturned to Amarapora, in order to come and take possession of the new\r\npalace in the customary style. As there has been much misunderstanding\r\nrelative to Ava and Amarapora, both being called the capital of the\r\nBurmese Empire, I will here remark, that present Ava was formerly the\r\nseat of government; but soon after the old king had ascended the throne,\r\nit was forsaken, and a new palace built at Amarapora, about six miles\r\nfrom Ava, in which he remained during his life. In the fourth year of\r\nthe reign of the present king, Amarapora was in its turn forsaken, and a\r\nnew and beautiful palace built at Ava, which was _then_ in ruins, but is\r\n_now the capital_ of the Burmese Empire, and the residence of the\r\nEmperor. The king and royal family had been living in the temporary\r\nbuildings at Ava, during the completion of the new palace, which gave\r\noccasion for their returning to Amarapora.\r\n\r\n\"I dare not attempt a description of that splendid day, when majesty\r\nwith all its attendant glory entered the gates of the golden city, and\r\namid the acclamations of millions, I may say, took possession of the\r\npalace. The saupwars of the provinces bordering on China, all the\r\nViceroys and high officers of the kingdom, were assembled on the\r\noccasion, dressed in their robes of state, and ornamented with the\r\ninsignia of their office. The white elephant, richly adorned with gold\r\nand jewels, was one of the most beautiful objects in the procession. The\r\nking and queen alone were unadorned, dressed in the simple garb of the\r\ncountry; they, hand in hand, entered the garden in which we had taken\r\nour seats, and where a banquet was prepared for their refreshment. All\r\nthe riches and glory of the empire were on this day exhibited to view.\r\nThe number and immense size of the elephants, the numerous horses, and\r\ngreat variety of vehicles of all descriptions, far surpassed any thing I\r\nhave ever seen or imagined. Soon after his majesty had taken possession\r\nof the new palace, an order was issued that no foreigner should be\r\nallowed to enter, excepting Lansago. We were a little alarmed at this,\r\nbut concluded it was from political motives, and would not, perhaps,\r\nessentially affect us.\r\n\r\n\"For several weeks nothing took place to alarm us, and we went on with\r\nour school. Mr. J. preached every Sabbath, all the materials for\r\nbuilding a brick house were procured, and the masons had made\r\nconsiderable progress in raising the building.\r\n\r\n\"On the 23d of May, 1824, just as we had concluded worship at the\r\nDoctor's house, the other side of the river, a messenger came to inform\r\nus that Rangoon was taken by the English. The intelligence produced a\r\nshock, in which was a mixture of fear and joy. Mr. Gouger, a young\r\nmerchant residing at Ava, was then with us, and had much more reason to\r\nfear than the rest of us. We all, however, immediately returned to our\r\nhouse, and began to consider what was to be done. Mr. G. went to prince\r\nThar-yar-wa-dee, the king's most influential brother, who informed him\r\nhe need not give himself any uneasiness, as he had mentioned the subject\r\nto his majesty, who had replied, that 'the few foreigners residing at\r\nAva, had nothing to do with the war, and should not be molested.'\r\n\r\n\"The government were now all in motion. An army of ten or twelve\r\nthousand men, under the command of the Kyee-woon-gyee, were sent off in\r\nthree or four days, and were to be joined by the Sakyer-woon-gyee, who\r\nhad previously been appointed Viceroy of Rangoon, and who was on his way\r\nthither, when the news of its attack reached him. No doubt was\r\nentertained of the defeat of the English; the only fear of the king was,\r\nthat the foreigners hearing of the advance of the Burmese troops, would\r\nbe so alarmed, as to flee on board their ships and depart, before there\r\nwould be time to secure them as slaves. 'Bring for me,' said a wild\r\nyoung buck of the palace, 'six kala pyoo, (white strangers,) to row my\r\nboat;' and 'to me,' said the lady of a Woongyee, 'send four white\r\nstrangers to manage the affairs of my house, as I understand they are\r\ntrusty servants.' The war boats, in high glee, passed our house, the\r\nsoldiers singing and dancing, and exhibiting gestures of the most joyous\r\nkind. Poor fellows! said we, you will probably never dance again. And\r\nit so proved, for few if any ever saw again their native home.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the army were despatched, the government began to inquire\r\nthe cause of the arrival of the strangers at Rangoon. There must be\r\nspies in the country, suggested some, who have invited them over. And\r\nwho so likely to be spies, as the Englishmen residing at Ava? A report\r\nwas in circulation, that Captain Laird, lately arrived, had brought\r\nBengal papers which contained the intention of the English to take\r\nRangoon, and it was kept a secret from his Majesty. An inquiry was\r\ninstituted. The three Englishmen, Gouger, Laird, and Rogers, were called\r\nand examined. It was found they had seen the papers, and were put in\r\nconfinement, though not in prison. We now began to tremble for\r\nourselves, and were in daily expectation of some dreadful event.\r\n\r\n\"At length Mr. Judson and Dr. Price were summoned to a court of\r\nexamination, where strict inquiry was made relative to all they knew.\r\nThe great point seemed to be whether they had been in the habit of\r\nmaking communications to foreigners, of the state of the country, &c.\r\nThey answered, they had always written to their friends in America, but\r\nhad no correspondence with English officers, or the Bengal government.\r\nAfter their examination, they were not put in confinement as the\r\nEnglishmen had been, but were allowed to return to their houses. In\r\nexamining the accounts of Mr. G. it was found that Mr. J. and Dr. Price\r\nhad taken money of him to a considerable amount. Ignorant, as were the\r\nBurmese, of our mode of receiving money, by orders on Bengal, this\r\ncircumstance, to their suspicious minds, was a sufficient evidence, that\r\nthe missionaries were in the pay of the English, and very probably\r\nspies. It was thus represented to the king, who, in an angry tone,\r\nordered the immediate arrest of the 'two teachers.'\r\n\r\n\"On the 8th of June, just as we were preparing for dinner, in rushed an\r\nofficer, holding a black book, with a dozen Burmans, accompanied by\r\n_one_, whom, from his spotted face, we knew to be an executioner, and a\r\n'son of the prison.' 'Where is the teacher?' was the first inquiry. Mr.\r\nJudson presented himself. 'You are called by the king,' said the\r\nofficer; a form of speech always used when about to arrest a criminal.\r\nThe spotted man instantly seized Mr. Judson, threw him on the floor, and\r\nproduced the small cord, the instrument of torture. I caught hold of his\r\narm; 'Stay, (said I,) I will give you money.' 'Take her too,' said the\r\nofficer; 'she also is a foreigner.' Mr. Judson, with an imploring look,\r\nbegged they would let me remain till further orders. The scene was now\r\nshocking beyond description. The whole neighbourhood had collected--the\r\nmasons at work on the brick house threw down their tools, and ran--the\r\nlittle Burman children were screaming and crying--the Bengalee servants\r\nstood in amazement at the indignities offered their master--and the\r\nhardened executioner, with a hellish joy, drew tight the cords, bound\r\nMr. Judson fast, and dragged him off, I knew not whither. In vain I\r\nbegged and entreated the spotted face to take the silver, and loosen\r\nthe ropes, but he spurned my offers, and immediately departed. I gave\r\nthe money, however, to Moung Ing to follow after, to make some further\r\nattempt to mitigate the torture of Mr. Judson; but instead of\r\nsucceeding, when a few rods from the house, the unfeeling wretches again\r\nthrew their prisoner on the ground, and drew the cords still tighter, so\r\nas almost to prevent respiration.\r\n\r\n\"The officer and his gang proceeded on to the court house, where the\r\nGovernor of the city and officers were collected, one of whom read the\r\norder of the king, to commit Mr. Judson to the death prison, into which\r\nhe was soon hurled, the door closed--and Moung Ing saw no more. What a\r\nnight was now before me! I retired into my room, and endeavoured to\r\nobtain consolation from committing my case to God, and imploring\r\nfortitude and strength to suffer whatever awaited me. But the\r\nconsolation of retirement was not long allowed me, for the magistrate of\r\nthe place had come into the verandah, and continually called me to come\r\nout, and submit to his examination. But previously to going out, I\r\ndestroyed all my letters, journals, and writings of every kind, lest\r\nthey should disclose the fact that we had correspondents in England, and\r\nhad minuted down every occurrence since our arrival in the country. When\r\nthis work of destruction was finished, I went out and submitted to the\r\nexamination of the magistrate, who inquired very minutely of everything\r\nI knew; then ordered the gates of the compound to be shut, no person be\r\nallowed to go in or out, placed a guard of ten ruffians, to whom he gave\r\na strict charge to keep me safe, and departed.\r\n\r\n\"It was now dark. I retired to an inner room with my four little Burman\r\ngirls, and barred the doors. The guard instantly ordered me to unbar the\r\ndoors and come out, or they would break the house down. I obstinately\r\nrefused to obey, and endeavoured to intimidate them by threatening to\r\ncomplain of their conduct to higher authorities on the morrow. Finding\r\nme resolved in disregarding their orders, they took the two Bengalee\r\nservants, and confined them in the stocks in a very painful position. I\r\ncould not endure this; but called the head man to the window, and\r\npromised to make them all a present in the morning, if they would\r\nrelease the servants. After much debate, and many severe threatenings,\r\nthey consented, but seemed resolved to annoy me as much as possible. My\r\nunprotected, desolate state, my entire uncertainty of the fate of Mr.\r\nJudson, and the dreadful carousings and almost diabolical language of\r\nthe guard, all conspired to make it by far the most distressing night I\r\nhad ever passed. You may well imagine, my dear brother, that sleep was a\r\nstranger to my eyes, and peace and composure to my mind.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning, I sent Moung Ing to ascertain the situation of your\r\nbrother, and give him food, if still living. He soon returned, with the\r\nintelligence, that Mr. Judson, and all the white foreigners, were\r\nconfined in the _death prison_, with three pairs of iron fetters each,\r\nand fastened to a long pole, to prevent their moving! The point of my\r\nanguish now was, that I was a prisoner myself, and could make no efforts\r\nfor the release of the Missionaries. I begged and entreated the\r\nmagistrate to allow me to go to some member of government to state my\r\ncase; but he said he did not dare to consent, for fear I should make my\r\nescape. I next wrote a note to one of the king's sisters, with whom I\r\nhad been intimate, requesting her to use her influence for the release\r\nof the teachers. The note was returned with this message--She 'did not\r\nunderstand it,'--which was a polite refusal to interfere; though I\r\nafterwards ascertained, that she had an anxious desire to assist us, but\r\ndared not on account of the queen. The day dragged heavily away, and\r\nanother dreadful night was before me. I endeavoured to soften the\r\nfeelings of the guard by giving them tea and segars for the night; so\r\nthat they allowed me to remain inside of my room, without threatening as\r\nthey did the night before. But the idea of your brother being stretched\r\non the bare floor in irons and confinement, haunted my mind like a\r\nspectre, and prevented my obtaining any quiet sleep, though nature was\r\nalmost exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"On the third day, I sent a message to the governor of the city, who has\r\nthe entire direction of prison affairs, to allow me to visit him with a\r\npresent. This had the desired effect; and he immediately sent orders to\r\nthe guards, to permit my going into town. The governor received me\r\npleasantly, and asked me what I wanted. I stated to him the situation of\r\nthe foreigners, and particularly that of the teachers, who were\r\nAmericans, and had nothing to do with the war. He told me it was not in\r\nhis power to release them from prison or irons, but that he could make\r\ntheir situation more comfortable; there was his head officer, with whom\r\nI must consult, relative to the means. The officer, who proved to be one\r\nof the city writers, and whose countenance at the first glance presented\r\nthe most perfect assemblage of all the evil passions attached to human\r\nnature, took me aside, and endeavoured to convince me, that myself, as\r\nwell as the prisoners, was entirely at his disposal--that our future\r\ncomfort must depend on my liberality in regard to presents--and that\r\nthese must be made in a private way and unknown to any officer in the\r\ngovernment! What must I do, said I, to obtain a mitigation of the\r\npresent sufferings of the two teachers? 'Pay to me,' said he, 'two\r\nhundred tickals, (about a hundred dollars,) two pieces of fine cloth,\r\nand two pieces of handkerchiefs.' I had taken money with me in the\r\nmorning, our house being two miles from the prison--I could not easily\r\nreturn. This I offered to the writer, and begged he would not insist on\r\nthe other articles, as they were not in my possession. He hesitated for\r\nsome time, but fearing to lose the sight of so much money, he concluded\r\nto take it, promising to relieve the teachers from their most painful\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\"I then procured an order from the governor, for my admittance into\r\nprison; but the sensations, produced by meeting your brother in that\r\n_wretched, horrid_ situation, and the affecting scene which ensued, I\r\nwill not attempt to describe. Mr. Judson crawled to the door of the\r\nprison--for I was never allowed to enter--gave me some directions\r\nrelative to his release; but before we could make any arrangement, I was\r\nordered to depart, by those iron hearted jailers, who could not endure\r\nto see us enjoy the poor consolation of meeting in that miserable place.\r\nIn vain I pleaded the order of the governor for my admittance; they\r\nagain, harshly repeated, 'Depart, or we will pull you out.' The same\r\nevening, the missionaries, together with the other foreigners, who had\r\npaid an equal sum, were taken out of the common prison, and confined in\r\nan open shed in the prison enclosure. Here I was allowed to send them\r\nfood, and mats to sleep on; but was not permitted to enter again for\r\nseveral days.\r\n\r\n\"My next object was to get a petition presented to the queen; but no\r\nperson being admitted into the palace, who was in disgrace with his\r\nMajesty, I sought to present it through the medium of her brother's\r\nwife. I had visited her in better days, and received particular marks of\r\nher favour. But now times were altered: Mr. Judson was in prison, and I\r\nin distress, which was a sufficient reason for giving me a cold\r\nreception. I took a present of considerable value. She was lolling on\r\nher carpet as I entered, with her attendants around her. I waited not\r\nfor the usual question to a suppliant, 'What do you want?' but in a\r\nhold, earnest, yet respectful manner, stated our distresses and our\r\nwrongs, and begged her assistance. She partly raised her head, opened\r\nthe present I had brought, and coolly replied, 'Your case is not\r\nsingular; all the foreigners are treated alike.' 'But it is singular,'\r\nsaid I, 'the teachers are Americans; they are ministers of religion,\r\nhave nothing to do with war or politics, and came to Ava in obedience to\r\nthe king's command. They have never done any thing to deserve such\r\ntreatment; and is it right they should be treated thus?' 'The king does\r\nas he pleases,' said she; 'I am not the king, what can I do?' 'You can\r\nstate their case to the queen, and obtain their release,' replied I.\r\n'Place yourself in my situation,--were you in America, your husband,\r\ninnocent of crime, thrown into prison, in irons, and you a solitary,\r\nunprotected female--what would you do?' With a slight degree of feeling,\r\nshe said, 'I will present your petition,--come again to-morrow.' I\r\nreturned to the house, with considerable hope, that the speedy release\r\nof the missionaries was at hand. But the next day Mr. Gouger's property,\r\nto the amount of fifty thousand dollars, was taken and carried to the\r\npalace. The officers, on their return, politely informed me, they should\r\n_visit our house_ on the morrow. I felt obliged for this information,\r\nand accordingly made preparations to receive them, by secreting as many\r\nlittle articles as possible; together with considerable silver, as I\r\nknew, if the war should be protracted, we should be in a state of\r\nstarvation without it. But my mind was in a dreadful state of agitation,\r\nlest it should be discovered, and cause my being thrown into prison. And\r\nhad it been possible to procure money from any other quarter, I should\r\nnot have ventured on such a step.\r\n\r\n\"The following morning, the royal treasurer, prince Tharyawadees, chief\r\nWoon, and Koung-tone Myoo-tsa, who was in future our steady friend,\r\nattended by forty or fifty followers, came to take possession of all we\r\nhad. I treated them civilly, gave them chairs to sit on, tea and\r\nsweetmeats for their refreshment; and justice obliges me to say, that\r\nthey conducted the business of confiscation with more regard to my\r\nfeelings than I should have thought it possible for Burmese officers to\r\nexhibit. The three officers, with one of the royal secretaries, alone\r\nentered the house; their attendants were ordered to remain outside. They\r\nsaw I was deeply affected, and apologized for what they were about to\r\ndo, by saying, that it was painful for them to take possession of\r\nproperty not their own, but they were compelled thus to do by order of\r\nthe king. 'Where is your silver, gold, and jewels?' said the royal\r\ntreasurer. 'I have no gold or jewels; but here is the key of a trunk\r\nwhich contains the silver--do with it as you please.' The trunk was\r\nproduced, and the silver weighed. 'This money,' said I, 'was collected\r\nin America, by the disciples of Christ, and sent here for the purpose of\r\nbuilding a kyoung, (the name of a priest's dwelling) and for our support\r\nwhile teaching the religion of Christ. Is it suitable that you should\r\ntake it? (The Burmans are averse to taking what is offered in a\r\nreligious point of view, which was the cause of my making the inquiry.)\r\n'We will state this circumstance to the king,' said one of them, 'and\r\nperhaps he will restore it. But this is all the silver you have?' I\r\ncould not tell a falsehood: 'The house is in your possession,' I\r\nreplied, 'search for yourselves.' 'Have you not deposited silver with\r\nsome person of your acquaintance?' 'My acquaintances are all in prison,\r\nwith whom should I deposit silver? They next ordered my trunk and\r\ndrawers to be examined. The secretary only was allowed to accompany me\r\nin this search. Everything nice or curious, which met his view, was\r\npresented to the officers, for their decision, whether it should be\r\ntaken or retained. I begged they would not take our wearing apparel, as\r\nit would be disgraceful to take clothes partly worn, into the possession\r\nof his majesty, and to us they were of unspeakable value. They assented,\r\nand took a list only, and did the same with the books, medicines, &c. My\r\nlittle work table and rocking chair, presents from my beloved brother, I\r\nrescued from their grasp, partly by artifice, and partly through their\r\nignorance. They left also many articles, which were of inestimable\r\nvalue, during our long imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as they had finished their search and departed, I hastened to\r\nthe queen's brother, to hear what had been the fate of my petition;\r\nwhen, alas! all my hopes were dashed, by his wife's coolly saying, 'I\r\nstated your case to the queen; but her majesty replied,--'_The teachers\r\nwill not die: let them remain as they are._' My expectations had been so\r\nmuch excited, that this sentence was like a thunderbolt to my feelings.\r\nFor the truth at one glance assured me, that if the queen refused\r\nassistance, who would dare to intercede for me? With a heavy heart I\r\ndeparted, and on my way home, attempted to enter the prison gate, to\r\ncommunicate the sad tidings to your brother but was harshly refused\r\nadmittance: and for the ten days following notwithstanding my daily\r\nefforts, I was not allowed to enter. We attempted to communicate by\r\nwriting, and after being successful for a few days, it was discovered;\r\nthe poor fellow who carried the communications was beaten and put in the\r\nstocks; and the circumstance cost me about ten dollars, besides two or\r\nthree days of agony, for fear of the consequences.\r\n\r\n\"The officers who had taken possession of our property, presented it to\r\nhis majesty, saying, 'Judson is a true teacher; we found nothing in his\r\nhouse, but what belongs to priests. In addition to this money, there are\r\nan immense number of books, medicines, trunks of wearing apparel, &c. of\r\nwhich we have only taken a list. Shall we take them, or let them\r\nremain?' 'Let them remain,' said the king, 'and put this property by\r\nitself, for it shall be restored to him again, if he is found innocent.'\r\nThis was an allusion to the idea of his being a spy.\r\n\r\n\"For two or three months following, I was subject to continual\r\nharassments, partly through my ignorance of police management and partly\r\nthrough the insatiable desire of every petty officer to enrich himself\r\nthrough our misfortunes. When the officers came to our house, to\r\nconfiscate our property, they insisted on knowing how much I had given\r\nthe governor and prison officers, to release the teachers from the inner\r\nprison. I honestly told them, and they demanded the sum from the\r\ngovernor, which threw him into a dreadful rage, and he threatened to put\r\nall the prisoners back into their original place. I went to him the next\r\nmorning, and the first words with which he accosted me, were, 'You are\r\nvery bad; why did you tell the royal treasurer that you had given me so\r\nmuch money?' 'The treasurer inquired; what could I say!' I replied. 'Say\r\nthat you had given nothing,' said he, 'and I would have made the\r\nteachers comfortable in prison; but now I know not what will be their\r\nfate.' 'But I cannot tell a falsehood,' I replied. 'My religion differs\r\nfrom yours, it forbids prevarication; and had you stood by me with your\r\nknife raised, I could not have said what you suggested.' His wife, who\r\nsat by his side, and who always, from this time, continued my firm\r\nfriend, instantly said, 'Very true--what else could she have said? I\r\nlike such straight-forward conduct; you must not (turning to the\r\ngovernor) be angry with her.' I then presented the governor with a\r\nbeautiful opera glass, I had just received from England, and begged his\r\nanger at me would not influence him to treat the prisoners with\r\nunkindness, and I would endeavour, from time to time, to make him such\r\npresents, as would compensate for his loss. 'You may intercede for your\r\nhusband only; for your sake, he shall remain where he is; but let the\r\nother prisoners take care of themselves.' I pleaded hard for Dr. Price;\r\nbut he would not listen, and the same day had him returned to the inner\r\nprison, where he remained ten days. He was then taken out, in\r\nconsequence of the Doctor's promising a piece of broad cloth, and my\r\nsending two pieces of handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n\"About this period, I was one day summoned to the Tlowtdan, in an\r\nofficial way. What new evil was before me, I knew not, but was obliged\r\nto go. When arrived, I was allowed to _stand_ at the bottom of the\r\nstairs, as no female is permitted to ascend the steps, or even to stand,\r\nbut sit on the ground. Hundreds were collected around. The officer who\r\npresided, in an authoritative voice, began; 'Speak the truth in answer\r\nto the questions I shall ask. If you speak true, no evil will follow;\r\nbut if not, your life will not be spared. It is reported that you have\r\ncommitted to the care of a Burmese officer, a string of pearls, a pair\r\nof diamond ear-rings, and a silver tea-pot. Is it true? 'It is not,' I\r\nreplied; 'and if you or any other person can produce these articles, I\r\nrefuse not to die.' The officer again urged the necessity of 'speaking\r\ntrue.' I told him I had nothing more to say on this subject, but begged\r\nhe would use his influence to obtain the release of Mr. Judson from\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n\"I returned to the house, with a heart much lighter than I went, though\r\nconscious of my perpetual exposure to such harassments. Notwithstanding\r\nthe repulse I had met in my application to the queen, I could not remain\r\nwithout making continual effort for your brother's release, while there\r\nwas the least probability of success. Time after time my visits to the\r\nqueen's sister-in-law were repeated, till she refused to answer a\r\nquestion, and told me by her looks, I had better keep out of her\r\npresence. For the seven following months, hardly a day passed, that I\r\ndid not visit some one of the members of government, or branches of the\r\nroyal family, in order to gain their influence in our behalf; but the\r\nonly benefit resulting was, their encouraging promises preserved us from\r\ndespair, and induced a hope of the speedy termination of our\r\ndifficulties, which enabled us to bear our distresses better than we\r\notherwise should have done. I ought, however, to mention, that by my\r\nrepeated visits to the different members of government, I gained several\r\nfriends, who were ready to assist me with articles of food, though in a\r\nprivate manner, and who used their influence in the palace to destroy\r\nthe impression of our being in any way engaged in the present war. But\r\nno one dared to speak a word to the king or queen in favor of a\r\nforeigner, while there were such continual reports of the success of the\r\nEnglish arms.\r\n\r\n\"During these seven months, the continual extortions and oppressions to\r\nwhich your brother, and the other white prisoners were subject, are\r\nindescribable. Sometimes sums of money were demanded, sometimes pieces\r\nof cloth and handkerchiefs; at other times, an order would be issued,\r\nthat the white foreigners should not speak to each other, or have any\r\ncommunication with their friends without. Then again, the servants were\r\nforbidden to carry in their food, without an extra fee. Sometimes, for\r\ndays and days together, I could not go into the prison till after dark,\r\nwhen I had two miles to walk, in returning to the house. O how many,\r\nmany times, have I returned from that dreary prison at nine o'clock at\r\nnight, solitary and worn out with fatigue and anxiety, and thrown myself\r\ndown in that same rocking chair which you and Deacon L. provided for me\r\nin Boston and endeavoured to invent some new scheme for the release of\r\nthe prisoners. Sometimes, for a moment or two, my thoughts would glance\r\ntoward America, and my beloved friends there--but for nearly a year and\r\na half, so entirely engrossed was every thought with present scenes and\r\nsufferings, that I seldom reflected on a single occurrence of my former\r\nlife, or recollected that I had a friend in existence out of Ava.\r\n\r\n\"You, my dear brother, who know my strong attachment to my friends, and\r\nhow much pleasure I have hitherto experienced from retrospect, can judge\r\nfrom the above circumstances, how intense were my sufferings. But the\r\npoint, the acme of my distresses, consisted in the awful uncertainty of\r\nour final fate. My prevailing opinion was, that my husband would suffer\r\nviolent death; and that I should, of course, become a slave, and\r\nlanguish out a miserable though short existence, in the tyrannic hands\r\nof some unfeeling monster. But the consolations of religion, in these\r\ntrying circumstances, were neither 'few nor small.' It taught me to look\r\nbeyond this world, to that rest, that peaceful, happy rest, where Jesus\r\nreigns, and oppression never enters. But how have I digressed from my\r\nrelation. I will again return.\r\n\r\n\"The war was now prosecuted with all the energy the Burmese government\r\npossessed. New troops were continually raised and sent down the river,\r\nand as frequent reports returned of their being all cut off. But that\r\npart of the Burmese army stationed at Arracan, under the command of\r\nBandoola, had been more successful. Three hundred prisoners, at one\r\ntime, was sent to the capital, as an evidence of the victory that had\r\nbeen gained. The king began to think that none but Bandoola understood\r\nthe art of fighting with foreigners; consequently his majesty recalled\r\nhim with the design of his taking command of the army that had been sent\r\nto Rangoon. On his arrival at Ava, he was received at court in the most\r\nflattering manner, and was the recipient of every favour in the power of\r\nthe king and queen to bestow. He was, in fact, while at Ava, the acting\r\nking. I was resolved to apply to him for the release of the\r\nmissionaries, though some members of government advised me not, lest he,\r\nbeing reminded of their existence, should issue an immediate order for\r\ntheir execution. But it was my last hope, and as it proved, my last\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n\"Your brother wrote a petition privately, stating every circumstance\r\nthat would have a tendency to interest him in our behalf. With fear and\r\ntrembling I approached him, while surrounded by a crowd of flatterers,\r\nand one of his secretaries took the petition, and read it aloud. After\r\nhearing it, he spake to me in an obliging manner--asked several\r\nquestions relative to the teachers--said he would think of the\r\nsubject--and bade me come again. I ran to the prison to communicate the\r\nfavourable reception to Mr. Judson; and we both had sanguine hopes that\r\nhis release was at hand. But the governor of the city expressed his\r\namazement at my temerity, and said he doubted not it would be the means\r\nof destroying all the prisoners. In a day or two, however, I went\r\nagain, and took a present of considerable value. Bandoola was not at\r\nhome; but his _lady_, after ordering the present to be taken into\r\nanother room, modestly informed me that she was ordered by her husband\r\nto make the following communication--that he was now very busily\r\nemployed in making preparations for Rangoon; but that when he had\r\nre-taken that place and expelled the English, he would return and\r\nrelease all the prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"Thus again were all our hopes dashed; and we felt that we could do\r\nnothing more, but sit down and submit to our lot. From this time we gave\r\nup all idea of being released from prison, till the termination of the\r\nwar; but I was still obliged to visit constantly some of the members of\r\ngovernment, with little presents, particularly the governor of the city,\r\nfor the purpose of making the situation of the prisoners tolerable. I\r\ngenerally spent the greater part of every other day at the governor's\r\nhouse, giving him all the information relative to American manners,\r\ncustoms, government, &c. He used to be so much gratified with my\r\ncommunications, as to feel greatly disappointed, if any occurrence\r\nprevented my spending the usual hours at his house.\r\n\r\n\"Some months after your brother's imprisonment, I was permitted to make\r\na little bamboo room in the prison enclosures, where he could be much by\r\nhimself, and where I was sometimes allowed to spend two or three hours.\r\nIt so happened that the two months he occupied this place, was the\r\ncoldest part of the year, when he would have suffered much in the open\r\nshed he had previously occupied. After the birth of your little niece, I\r\nwas unable to visit the prison and the governor as before, and found I\r\nhad lost considerable influence, previously gained; for he was not so\r\nforward to hear my petitions when any difficulty occurred, as he\r\nformerly had been. When Maria was nearly two months old, her father one\r\nmorning sent me word that he and all the white prisoners were put into\r\nthe inner prison in five pairs of fetters each, that his little room had\r\nbeen torn down, and his mat, pillow, &c. been taken by the jailers. This\r\nwas to me a dreadful shock, as I thought at once it was only a prelude\r\nto greater evils.\r\n\r\n\"I should have mentioned before this, the defeat of Bandoola, his escape\r\nto Danooboo, the complete destruction of his army and loss of\r\nammunition, and the consternation this intelligence produced at court.\r\nThe English army had left Rangoon, and were advancing towards Prome,\r\nwhen these severe measures were taken with the prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"I went immediately to the governor's house. He was not at home, but had\r\nordered his wife to tell me, when I came, not to ask to have the\r\nadditional fetters taken off, or the prisoners released, for _it could\r\nnot be done_. I went to the prison gate, but was forbid to enter. All\r\nwas as still as death--not a white face to be seen, or a vestige of Mr.\r\nJ.'s little room remaining. I was determined to see the governor and\r\nknow the cause of this additional oppression; and for this purpose\r\nreturned to town the same evening, at an hour I knew he would be at\r\nhome. He was in his audience room, and, as I entered, looked up without\r\nspeaking, but exhibited a mixture of shame and affected anger in his\r\ncountenance. I began by saying--Your Lordship has hitherto treated us\r\nwith the kindness of a father. Our obligations to you are very great. We\r\nhave looked to you for protection from oppression and cruelty. You have\r\nin many instances mitigated the sufferings of those unfortunate, though\r\ninnocent beings, committed to your charge. You have promised me\r\nparticularly, that you would stand by me to the last, and though you\r\nshould receive an order from the king, you would not put Mr. J. to\r\ndeath. What crime has he committed to deserve such additional\r\npunishment? The old man's hard heart was melted, for he wept like a\r\nchild. 'I pity you, Tsa-yar-ga-dau, (a name by which he always called\r\nme) I knew you would make me feel; I therefore forbade your application.\r\nBut you must believe me when I say, I do not wish to increase the\r\nsufferings of the prisoners. When I am ordered to execute them, the\r\nleast that I can do is, to put them out of sight. I will now tell you\r\n(continued he) what I have never told you before, that three times I\r\nhave received intimations from the queen's brother, to assassinate all\r\nthe white prisoners privately; but I would not do it. And I now repeat\r\nit, though I execute all the others, I will never execute your husband.\r\nBut I cannot release him from his present confinement, and you must not\r\nask it.' I had never seen him manifest so much feeling, or so resolute\r\nin denying me a favour, which circumstance was an additional reason for\r\nthinking dreadful scenes were before us.\r\n\r\n\"The situation of the prisoners was now distressing beyond description.\r\nIt was at the commencement of the hot season. There were above a hundred\r\nprisoners shut up in one room, without a breath of air excepting from\r\nthe cracks in the boards. I sometimes obtained permission to go to the\r\ndoor for five minutes, when my heart sickened at the wretchedness\r\nexhibited. The white prisoners, from incessant perspiration and loss of\r\nappetite, looked more like the dead than the living. I made daily\r\napplications to the governor, offering him money, which he refused; but\r\nall that I gained, was permission for the foreigners to eat their food\r\noutside, and this continued but a short time.\r\n\r\n\"It was at this period that the death of Bandoola was announced in the\r\npalace. The king heard it with silent amazement, and the queen, in\r\neastern style, smote upon her breast, and cried, ama! ama! (alas, alas.)\r\nWho could be found to fill his place? who would venture since the\r\ninvincible Bandoola had been cut off? Such were the exclamations\r\nconstantly heard in the streets of Ava. The common people were speaking\r\n_low_ of a rebellion, in case more troops should be levied. For as yet\r\nthe common people had borne the weight of the war, not a tickal had been\r\ntaken from the royal treasury. At length the Pakan Woon, who a few\r\nmonths before had been so far disgraced by the king as to be thrown into\r\nprison and irons, now offered himself to head a new army that should be\r\nraised on a different plan from those which had been hitherto raised;\r\nand assured the king in the most confident manner, that he would conquer\r\nthe English, and restore those places that had been taken, in a very\r\nshort time. He proposed that every soldier should receive a hundred\r\ntickals in advance, and he would obtain security for each man, as the\r\nmoney was to pass through his hands. It was afterwards found that he had\r\ntaken, for his own use, ten tickals from every hundred. He was a man of\r\nenterprise and talents, though a violent enemy to all foreigners. His\r\noffers were accepted by the king and government, and all power\r\nimmediately committed to him. One of the first exercises of his power\r\nwas, to arrest Lansago and the Portuguese priest, who had hitherto\r\nremained unmolested, and cast them into prison, and to subject the\r\nnative Portuguese and Bengalees to the most menial occupations. The\r\nwhole town was in alarm, lest they should feel the effects of his power;\r\nand it was owing to the malignant representations of this man, that the\r\nwhite prisoners suffered such a change in their circumstances, as I\r\nshall soon relate.\r\n\r\n\"After continuing in the inner prison for more than a month, your\r\nbrother was taken with a fever. I felt assured he would not live long,\r\nunless removed from that noisome place. To effect this, and in order to\r\nbe near the prison, I removed from our house and put up a small bamboo\r\nroom in the governor's enclosure, which was nearly opposite the prison\r\ngate. Here I incessantly begged the governor to give me an order to take\r\nMr. J. out of the large prison, and place him in a more comfortable\r\nsituation; and the old man, being worn out with my entreaties, at length\r\ngave me the order in an official form; and also gave orders to the head\r\njailer, to allow me to go in and out, all times of the day, to\r\nadminister medicines, &c. I now felt happy indeed, and had Mr. J.\r\ninstantly removed into a little bamboo hovel, so low, that neither of us\r\ncould stand upright--but a palace in comparison with the place he had\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Removal of the prisoners to Oung-pen-la--Mrs. Judson follows them._\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the order the governor had given for my admittance into\r\nprison, it was with the greatest difficulty that I could persuade the\r\nunder jailer to open the gate. I used to carry Mr. J's. food myself, for\r\nthe sake of getting in, and would then remain an hour or two, unless\r\ndriven out. We had been in this comfortable situation but two or three\r\ndays, when one morning, having carried in Mr. Judson's breakfast, which,\r\nin consequence of fever, he was unable to take, I remained longer than\r\nusual, when the governor in great haste sent for me. I promised him to\r\nreturn as soon as I had ascertained the governor's will, he being much\r\nalarmed at this unusual message. I was very agreeably disappointed, when\r\nthe governor informed, that he only wished to consult me about his\r\nwatch, and seemed unusually pleasant and conversable. I found\r\nafterwards, that his only object was, to detain me until the dreadful\r\nscene, about to take place in the prison, was over. For when I left him\r\nto go to my room, one of the servants came running, and with a ghastly\r\ncountenance informed me, that all the white prisoners were carried away.\r\nI would not believe the report, but instantly went back to the governor,\r\nwho said he had just heard of it, but did not wish to tell me. I hastily\r\nran into the street, hoping to get a glimpse of them before they were\r\nout of sight, but in this was disappointed. I ran first into one street,\r\nthen another, inquiring of all I met, but none would answer me. At\r\nlength an old woman told me the white prisoners had gone towards the\r\nlittle river; for they were to be carried to Amarapora. I then ran to\r\nthe banks of the little river, about half a mile, but saw them not, and\r\nconcluded the old woman had deceived me. Some of the friends of the\r\nforeigners went to the place of execution, but found them not. I then\r\nreturned to the governor to try to discover the cause of their removal,\r\nand the probability of their future fate. The old man assured me that he\r\nwas ignorant of the intention of government to remove the foreigners\r\ntill that morning. That since I went out, he had learned that the\r\nprisoners were to be sent to Amarapora; but for what purpose, he knew\r\nnot. 'I will send off a man immediately,' said he, 'to see what is to be\r\ndone with them. You can do nothing more for your husband,' continued he,\r\n'_take care of yourself_.' With a heavy heart I went to my room, and\r\nhaving no hope to excite me to exertion, I sunk down almost in despair.\r\nFor several days previous, I had been actively engaged in building my\r\nown little room, and making our hovel comfortable. My thoughts had been\r\nalmost entirely occupied in contriving means to get into prison. But now\r\nI looked towards the gate with a kind of melancholy feeling, but no wish\r\nto enter. All was the stillness of death; no preparation of your\r\nbrother's food, no expectation of meeting him at the usual dinner hour,\r\nall my employment, all my occupations seemed to have ceased, and I had\r\nnothing left but the dreadful recollection that Mr. Judson was carried\r\noff, I knew not whither. It was one of the most insupportable days I\r\never passed. Towards night, however, I came to the determination to set\r\noff the next morning for Amarapora; and for this purpose was obliged to\r\ngo to our house out of town.\r\n\r\n\"Never before had I suffered so much from fear in traversing the streets\r\nof Ava. The last words of the governor, 'Take care of yourself,' made me\r\nsuspect there was some design with which I was unacquainted. I saw,\r\nalso, he was afraid to have me go into the streets, and advised me to\r\nwait till dark, when he would send me in a cart, and a man to open the\r\ngates. I took two or three trunks of the most valuable articles,\r\ntogether with the medicine chest, to deposit in the house of the\r\ngovernor; and after committing the house and premises to our faithful\r\nMoung Ing and a Bengalee servant, who continued with us, (though we were\r\nunable to pay his wages,) I took leave, as I then thought probable, of\r\nour house in Ava forever.\r\n\r\n\"On my return to the governor's, I found a servant of Mr. Gouges, who\r\nhappened to be near the prison when the foreigners were led out, and\r\nfollowed on to see the end, who informed me, that the prisoners had been\r\ncarried before the Lamine Woon, at Amarapora, and were to be sent the\r\nnext day to a village he knew not how far distant. My distress was a\r\nlittle relieved by the intelligence that our friend was yet alive, but\r\nstill I knew not what was to become of him. The next morning I obtained\r\na pass from government, and with my little Maria, who was then only\r\nthree months old, Mary and Abby Hasseltine, (two of the Burman children)\r\nand our Bengalee cook, who was the only one of the party who could\r\nafford me any assistance, I set off for Amarapora. The day was\r\ndreadfully hot; but we obtained a covered boat, in which we were\r\ntolerably comfortable, till within two miles of the government house. I\r\nthen procured a cart; but the violent motion, together with the dreadful\r\nheat and dust; made me almost distracted. But what was my disappointment\r\non my arriving at the court house, to find that the prisoners had been\r\nsent on two hours before, and that I must go in that uncomfortable mode\r\nfour miles further with little Maria in my arms, whom I held all the way\r\nfrom Ava. The cart man refused to go any further; and after waiting an\r\nhour in the burning sun, I procured another, and set off for that never\r\nto be forgotten place, Oung-pen-la. I obtained a guide from the governor\r\nand was conducted directly to the prison-yard. But what a scene of\r\nwretchedness was presented to my view! The prison was an old shattered\r\nbuilding, without a roof; the fence was entirely destroyed; eight or ten\r\nBurmese were on the top of the building, trying to make something like a\r\nshelter with the leaves; while under a little low projection outside of\r\nthe prison sat the foreigners, chained together two and two, almost dead\r\nwith suffering and fatigue. The first words of your brother were, 'Why\r\nhave you come? I hoped you would not follow, for you cannot live here.'\r\nIt was now dark. I had no refreshment for the suffering prisoners, or\r\nfor myself, as I had expected to procure all that was necessary at the\r\nmarket of Amarapora, and I had no shelter for the night. I asked one of\r\nthe jailers if I might put up a little bamboo house near the prisoners;\r\nhe said no, it was not customary. I then begged he would procure me a\r\nshelter for the night, when on the morrow I could find some place to\r\nlive in. He took me to his house, in which there were only two small\r\nrooms--one in which he and his family lived--the other, which was then\r\nhalf full of grain, he offered to me; and in that little filthy place, I\r\nspent the next six months of wretchedness. I procured some half boiled\r\nwater, instead of my tea, and, worn out with fatigue, laid myself down\r\non a mat spread over the paddy, and endeavoured to obtain a little\r\nrefreshment from sleep. The next morning your brother gave me the\r\nfollowing account of the brutal treatment he had received on being taken\r\nout of prison.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I had gone out at the call of the governor, one of the\r\njailers rushed into Mr. J's little room--roughly seized him by the\r\narm--pulled him out--stripped him of all his clothes, excepting shirt\r\nand pantaloons--took his shoes, hat, and all his bedding--tore off his\r\nchains--tied a rope round his waist, and dragged him to the court house,\r\nwhere the other prisoners had previously been taken. They were then tied\r\ntwo and two, and delivered into the hands of the Lamine Woon, who went\r\non before them on horseback, while his slaves drove the prisoners, one\r\nof the slaves holding the rope which connected two of them together. It\r\nwas in May, one of the hottest months in the year, and eleven o'clock in\r\nthe day, so that the sun was intolerable indeed. They had proceeded only\r\nhalf a mile, when your brother's feet became blistered, and so great was\r\nhis agony, even at this early period, that as they were crossing the\r\nlittle river, he longed to throw himself into the water to be free from\r\nmisery. But the sin attached to such an act alone prevented. They had\r\nthen eight miles to walk. The sand and gravel were like burning coals to\r\nthe feet of the prisoners, which soon became perfectly destitute of\r\nskin; and in this wretched state they were goaded on by their unfeeling\r\ndrivers. Mr. J.'s debilitated state, in consequence of fever, and having\r\ntaken no food that morning, rendered him less capable of bearing such\r\nhardships than the other prisoners. When about half way on their\r\njourney, as they stopped for water, your brother begged the Lamine Woon\r\nto allow him to ride his horse a mile or two, as he could proceed no\r\nfarther in that dreadful state. But a scornful, malignant look, was all\r\nthe reply that was made. He then requested captain Laird, who was tied\r\nwith him, and who was a strong, healthy man, to allow him to take hold\r\nof his shoulder, as he was fast sinking. This the kind-hearted man\r\ngranted for a mile or two, but then found the additional burden\r\ninsupportable. Just at that period, Mr. Gouger's Bengalee servant came\r\nup to them, and seeing the distresses of your brother, took off his head\r\ndress, which was made of cloth, tore it in two, gave half to his master,\r\nand half to Mr. Judson, which he instantly wrapt round his wounded feet,\r\nas they were not allowed to rest even for a moment. The servant then\r\noffered his shoulder to Mr. J. and was almost carried by him the\r\nremainder of the way. Had it not been for the support and assistance of\r\nthis man, your brother thinks he should have shared the fate of the poor\r\nGreek, who was one of their number, and when taken out of prison that\r\nmorning was in perfect health. But he was a corpulent man, and the sun\r\naffected him so much that he fell down on the way. His inhuman drivers\r\nbeat and dragged him until they themselves were wearied, when they\r\nprocured a cart, in which he was carried the remaining two miles. But\r\nthe poor creature expired in an hour or two after their arrival at the\r\ncourt house. The Lamine Woon seeing the distressing state of the\r\nprisoners, and that one of their number was dead, concluded they should\r\ngo no farther that night, otherwise they would have been driven on until\r\nthey reached Oung-pen-la the same day. An old shed was appointed for\r\ntheir abode during the night, but without even a mat or pillow, or any\r\nthing to cover them. The curiosity of the Lamine Woon's wife, induced\r\nher to make a visit to the prisoners, whose wretchedness considerably\r\nexcited her compassion, and she ordered some fruit, sugar, and\r\ntamarinds, for their refreshment; and the next morning rice was prepared\r\nfor them, and as poor as it was, it was refreshing to the prisoners, who\r\nhad been almost destitute of food the day before. Carts were also\r\nprovided for their conveyance, as none of them were able to walk. All\r\nthis time the foreigners were entirely ignorant of what was to become of\r\nthem; and when they arrived at Oung-pen-la, and saw the dilapidated\r\nstate of the prison, they immediately, all as one, concluded that they\r\nwere there to be burnt, agreeably to the report which had previously\r\nbeen in circulation at Ava. They all endeavoured to prepare themselves\r\nfor the awful scene anticipated, and it was not until they saw\r\npreparations making for repairing the prison, that they had the least\r\ndoubt that a cruel lingering death awaited them. My arrival was in an\r\nhour or two after this.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning I arose and endeavoured to find something like food.\r\nBut there was no market, and nothing to be procured. One of Dr. Price's\r\nfriends, however, brought some cold rice and vegetable curry, from\r\nAmarapora, which, together with a cup of tea from Mr. Lansago, answered\r\nfor the breakfast of the prisoners; and for dinner, we made a curry of\r\ndried salt fish, which a servant of Mr. Gouger had brought. All the\r\nmoney I could command in the world, I had brought with me, secreted\r\nabout my person; so you may judge what our prospects were, in case the\r\nwar should continue long. But our heavenly Father was better to us than\r\nour fears; for notwithstanding the constant extortions of the jailers,\r\nduring the whole six months we were at Oung-pen-la, and the frequent\r\nstraits to which we were brought, we never really suffered for the want\r\nof money, though frequently for want of provisions, which were not\r\nprocurable. Here at this place my personal bodily sufferings commenced.\r\nWhile your brother was confined in the city prison, I had been allowed\r\nto remain in our house, in which I had many conveniences left, and my\r\nhealth continued good beyond all expectations. But now I had not a\r\nsingle article of convenience--not even a chair or seat of any kind,\r\nexcepting a bamboo floor. The very morning after my arrival, Mary\r\nHasseltine was taken with the small pox, the natural way. She, though\r\nvery young, was the only assistant I had in taking care of little Maria.\r\nBut she now required all the time I could spare from Mr. Judson, whose\r\nfever still continued in prison, and whose feet were so dreadfully\r\nmangled, that for several days he was unable to move. I knew not what to\r\ndo, for I could procure no assistance from the neighbourhood, or\r\nmedicine for the sufferers, but was all day long going backwards and\r\nforwards from the house to the prison, with little Maria in my arms.\r\nSometimes I was greatly relieved by leaving her, for an hour, when\r\nasleep, by the side of her father, while I returned to the house to look\r\nafter Mary, whose fever ran so high as to produce delirium. She was so\r\ncompletely covered with the small pox, that there was no distinction in\r\nthe pustules. As she was in the same little room with myself, I knew\r\nMaria would take it; I therefore inoculated her from another child,\r\nbefore Mary's had arrived at such a state as to be infectious. At the\r\nsame time, I inoculated Abby, and the jailer's children, who all had it\r\nso lightly as hardly to interrupt their play. But the inoculation in the\r\narm of my poor little Maria did not take--she caught it of Mary, and had\r\nit the natural way. She was then only three months and a half old, and\r\nhad been a most healthy child; but it was above three months before she\r\nperfectly recovered from the effects of this dreadful disorder.\r\n\r\n\"You will recollect I never had the small pox, but was vaccinated\r\npreviously to leaving America. In consequence of being for so long a\r\ntime constantly exposed, I had nearly a hundred pustules formed, though\r\nno previous symptoms of fever, &c. The jailer's children having had the\r\nsmall pox so lightly, in consequence of inoculation, my fame was spread\r\nall over the village, and every child, young and old, who had not\r\npreviously had it, was brought for inoculation. And although I knew\r\nnothing about the disorder, or the mode of treating it, I inoculated\r\nthem all with a needle, and told them to take care of their diet,--all\r\nthe instructions I could give them. Mr. Judson's health was gradually\r\nrestored, and he found himself much more comfortably situated, than when\r\nin the city prison.\r\n\r\n\"The prisoners were at first chained two and two; but as soon as the\r\njailers could obtain chains sufficient, they were separated, and each\r\nprisoner had but one pair. The prison was repaired, a new fence made,\r\nand a large airy shed erected in front of the prison, where the\r\nprisoners were allowed to remain during the day, though locked up in the\r\nlittle close prison at night. All the children recovered from the small\r\npox; but my watchings and fatigue, together with my miserable food, and\r\nmore miserable lodgings, brought on one of the diseases of the country,\r\nwhich is almost always fatal to foreigners. My constitution seemed\r\ndestroyed, and in a few days I became so weak as to be hardly able to\r\nwalk to Mr. Judson's prison. In this debilitated state, I set off in a\r\ncart for Ava, to procure medicines, and some suitable food, leaving the\r\ncook to supply my place. I reached the house in safety, and for two or\r\nthree days the disorder seemed at a stand; after which it attacked me so\r\nviolently, that I had no hopes of recovery left--and my only anxiety now\r\nwas, to return to Oung-pen-la to die near the prison. It was with the\r\ngreatest difficulty that I obtained the medicine chest from the\r\ngovernor, and then had no one to administer medicine. I however got at\r\nthe laudanum, and by taking two drops at a time for several hours, it so\r\nfar checked the disorder, as to enable me to get on board a boat, though\r\nso weak that I could not stand, and again set off for Oung-pen-la. The\r\nlast four miles was in that painful conveyance, the cart, and in the\r\nmidst of the rainy season, when the mud almost buries the oxen. You may\r\nform some idea of a Burmese cart, when I tell you their wheels are not\r\nconstructed like ours; but are simply round thick planks with a hole in\r\nthe middle, through which a pole that supports the body is thrust.\r\n\r\n\"I just reached Oung-pen-la when my strength seemed entirely exhausted.\r\nThe good native cook came out to help me into the house but so altered\r\nand emaciated was my appearance, that the poor fellow burst into tears\r\nat the first sight. I crawled on to the mat in the little room, to which\r\nI was confined for more than two months, and never perfectly recovered,\r\nuntil I came to the English camp. At this period, when I was unable to\r\ntake care of myself, or look after Mr. Judson, we must both have died,\r\nhad it not been for the faithful and affectionate care of our Bengalee\r\ncook. A common Bengalee cook will do nothing but the simple business of\r\ncooking: But he seemed to forget his cast, and almost his own wants, in\r\nhis efforts to serve us. He would provide, cook, and carry your\r\nbrother's food, and then return and take care of me. I have frequently\r\nknown him not to taste of food till near night, in consequence of having\r\nto go so far for wood and water, and in order to have Mr. Judson's\r\ndinner ready at the usual hour. He never complained, never asked for his\r\nwages, and never for a moment hesitated to go any where, or to perform\r\nany act we required. I take great pleasure in speaking of the faithful\r\nconduct of this servant, who is still with us, and I trust has been well\r\nrewarded for his services.\r\n\r\n\"Our dear little Maria was the greatest sufferer at this time, my\r\nillness depriving her of her usual nourishment, and neither a nurse nor\r\na drop of milk could be procured in the village. By making presents to\r\nthe jailers, I obtained leave for Mr. Judson to come out of prison, and\r\ntake the emaciated creature around the village, to beg a little\r\nnourishment from those mothers who had young children. Her cries in the\r\nnight were heart-rending, when it was impossible to supply her wants. I\r\nnow began to think the very afflictions of Job had come upon me. When in\r\nhealth, I could bear the various trials and vicissitudes through which I\r\nwas called to pass. But to be confined with sickness, and unable to\r\nassist those who were so dear to me, when in distress, was almost too\r\nmuch for me to bear; and had it not been for the consolations of\r\nreligion, and an assured conviction that every additional trial was\r\nordered by infinite love and mercy, I must have sunk under my\r\naccumulated sufferings. Sometimes our jailers seemed a little softened\r\nat our distress, and for several days together allowed Mr. Judson to\r\ncome to the house, which was to me an unspeakable consolation. Then\r\nagain they would be as iron-hearted in their demands, as though we were\r\nfree from sufferings, and in affluent circumstances. The annoyance, the\r\nextortions, and oppressions, to which we were subject, during our six\r\nmonths residence in Oung-pen-la, are beyond enumeration or description.\r\n\r\n\"It was some time after our arrival at Oung-pen-la, that we heard of the\r\nexecution of the Pakan Woon, in consequence of which our lives were\r\nstill preserved. For we afterwards ascertained, that the white\r\nforeigners had been sent to Oung-pen-la, for the express purpose of\r\nsacrificing them, and that he himself intended witnessing the horrid\r\nscene. We had frequently heard of his intended arrival at Oung-pen-la;\r\nbut we had no idea of his diabolical purposes. He had raised an army of\r\nfifty thousand men, (a tenth part of whose advanced pay was found in his\r\nhouse,) and expected to march against the English army in a short time,\r\nwhen he was suspected of high treason, and instantly executed without\r\nthe least examination. Perhaps no death in Ava ever produced such\r\nuniversal rejoicings, as that of the Pakan Woon. We never, to this day,\r\nhear his name mentioned, but with an epithet of reproach or hatred.\r\nAnother brother of the king was appointed to the command of the army now\r\nin readiness, but with no very sanguine expectations of success. Some\r\nweeks after the departure of these troops, two of the Woongyees were\r\nsent down for the purpose of negotiating. But not being successful, the\r\nqueen's brother, the _acting king_ of the country, was prevailed on to\r\ngo. Great expectations were raised in consequence; but his cowardice\r\ninduced him to encamp his detachment of the army at a great distance\r\nfrom the English, and even at a distance from the main body of the\r\nBurmese army, whose head-quarters were then at Maloun. Thus he effected\r\nnothing, though reports were continually reaching us, that peace was\r\nnearly concluded.\r\n\r\n\"The time at length arrived for our release from that detested place,\r\nthe Oung-pen-la prison. A messenger from our friend, the governor of the\r\nnorth gate of the palace, who was formerly Koung-tone, Myoo-tsa,\r\ninformed us that an order had been given, the evening before, in the\r\npalace, for Mr. Judson's release. On the same evening an official order\r\narrived; and with a joyful heart I set about preparing for our departure\r\nearly the following morning. But an unexpected obstacle occurred, which\r\nmade us fear that _I_ should still be retained as a prisoner. The\r\navaricious jailers, unwilling to lose their prey, insisted, that as my\r\nname was not included in the order, I should not go. In vain I urged\r\nthat I was not sent there as a prisoner, and that they had no authority\r\nover me--they still determined I should not go, and forbade the\r\nvillagers from letting me a cart. Mr. Judson was then taken out of\r\nprison, and brought to the jailer's house, where, by promises and\r\nthreatenings, he finally gained their consent, on condition that we\r\nwould leave the remaining part of our provisions we had recently\r\nreceived from Ava. It was noon before we were allowed to depart. When we\r\nreached Amarapora, Mr. Judson was obliged to follow the guidance of the\r\njailer, who conducted him to the governor of the city. Having made all\r\nnecessary inquiries, the governor appointed another guard, which\r\nconveyed Mr. Judson to the court-house in Ava, to which place he arrived\r\nsome time in the night. I took my own course, procured a boat, and\r\nreached our house before dark.\r\n\r\n\"My first object the next morning, was to go in search of your brother,\r\nand I had the mortification to meet him again in prison, though not the\r\ndeath prison. I went immediately to my old friend the governor of the\r\ncity, who now was raised to the rank of a Woongyee. He informed me that\r\nMr. Judson was to be sent to the Burmese camp, to act as translator and\r\ninterpreter; and that he was put in confinement for a short time only,\r\ntill his affairs were settled. Early the following morning I went to\r\nthis officer again, who told me that Mr. Judson had that moment received\r\ntwenty tickals from government, with orders to go immediately on board a\r\nboat for Maloun, and that _he_ had given him permission to stop a few\r\nmoments at the house, it being on his way. I hastened back to the house,\r\nwhere Mr. Judson soon arrived; but was allowed to remain only a short\r\ntime, while I could prepare food and clothing for future use. He was\r\ncrowded into a little boat, where he had not room sufficient to lie\r\ndown, and where his exposure to the cold damp nights threw him into a\r\nviolent fever, which had nearly ended all his sufferings. He arrived at\r\nMaloun on the third day, where, ill as he was, he was obliged to enter\r\nimmediately on the work of translating. He remained at Maloun six weeks,\r\nsuffering as much as he had at any time in prison, excepting he was not\r\nin irons, nor exposed to the insults of those cruel jailers.\r\n\r\n\"For the first fortnight after his departure, my anxiety was less than\r\nit had been at any time previous, since the commencement of our\r\ndifficulties. I knew the Burmese officers at the camp would feel the\r\nvalue of Mr. Judson's services too much to allow their using any\r\nmeasures threatening his life. I thought his situation, also, would be\r\nmuch more comfortable than it really was--hence my anxiety was less. But\r\nmy health, which had never been restored, since that violent attack at\r\nOung-pen-la, now daily declined, till I was seized with the spotted\r\nfever, with all its attendant horrors. I knew the nature of the fever\r\nfrom its commencement; and from the shattered state of my constitution,\r\ntogether with the want of medical attendants, I concluded it must be\r\nfatal. The day I was taken, a Burmese nurse came and offered her\r\nservices for Maria. This circumstance filled me with gratitude and\r\nconfidence in God; for though I had so long and so constantly made\r\nefforts to obtain a person of this description, I had never been able;\r\nwhen at the very time I most needed one, and with out any exertion, a\r\nvoluntary offer was made. My fever raged violently and without any\r\nintermission. I began to think of settling my worldly affairs, and of\r\ncommitting my dear little Maria to the care of a Portuguese woman, when\r\nI lost my reason, and was insensible to all around me. At this dreadful\r\nperiod, Dr. Price was released from prison; and hearing of my illness,\r\nobtained permission to come and see me. He has since told me that my\r\nsituation was the most distressing he had ever witnessed, and that he\r\ndid not then think I should survive many hours. My hair was shaved, my\r\nhead and feet covered with blisters, and Dr. Price ordered the Bengalee\r\nservant who took care of me, to endeavour to persuade me to take a\r\nlittle nourishment, which I had obstinately refused for several days.\r\nOne of the first things I recollect was, seeing this faithful servant\r\nstanding by me, trying to induce me to take a little wine and water. I\r\nwas in fact so far gone, that the Burmese neighbours who had come in to\r\nsee me expire, said, 'She is dead; and if the king of angels should come\r\nin, he could not recover her.'\r\n\r\n\"The fever, I afterwards understood, had run seventeen days when the\r\nblisters were applied. I now began to recover slowly; but it was more\r\nthan a month after this before I had strength to stand. While in this\r\nweak, debilitated state, the servant who had followed your brother to\r\nthe Burmese camp, came in, and informed me that his master had arrived,\r\nand was conducted to the court-house in town. I sent off a Burman to\r\nwatch the movements of government, and to ascertain, if possible, in\r\nwhat way Mr. Judson was to be disposed of. He soon returned with the sad\r\nintelligence, that he saw Mr. Judson go out of the palace yard,\r\naccompanied by two or three Burmans, who conducted him to one of the\r\nprisons; and that it was reported in town, that he was to be sent back\r\nto the Oung-pen-la prison. I was too weak to bear ill tidings of any\r\nkind; but a shock so dreadful as this, almost annihilated me. For some\r\ntime, I could hardly breathe; but at last gained sufficient composure to\r\ndispatch Moung Ing to our friend, the governor of the north gate, and\r\nbegged him to make _one more effort_ for the release of Mr. Judson, and\r\nprevent his being sent back to the country prison, where I knew he must\r\nsuffer much, as I could not follow. Moung Ing then went in search of Mr.\r\nJudson; and it was nearly dark when he found him in the interior of an\r\nobscure prison. I had sent food early in the afternoon, but being unable\r\nto find him, the bearer had returned with it, which added another pang\r\nto my distresses, as I feared he was already sent to Oung-pen-la.\r\n\r\n\"If I ever felt the value and efficacy of prayer, I did at this time. I\r\ncould not rise from my couch; I could make no efforts to secure my\r\nhusband; I could only plead with that great and powerful Being who has\r\nsaid, 'Call upon me in the day of trouble, and _I will hear_, and thou\r\nshalt glorify me;'\" and who made me at this time feel so powerfully this\r\npromise, that I became quite composed, feeling assured that my prayers\r\nwould be answered.\r\n\r\n\"When Mr. Judson was sent from Maloun to Ava, it was within five\r\nminutes' notice, and without his knowledge of the cause. On his way up\r\nthe river, he accidently saw the communication made to government\r\nrespecting him, which was simply this: 'We have no further use for\r\nYoodathan, we therefore return him to the golden city.' On arriving at\r\nthe court-house, there happened to be no one present who was acquainted\r\nwith Mr. J. The presiding officer inquired from what place he had been\r\nsent to Maloun. He was answered from Oung-pen-la. Let him then, said the\r\nofficer, be returned thither--when he was delivered to a guard and\r\nconducted to the place above-mentioned, there to remain until he could\r\nbe conveyed to Oung-pen-la. In the mean time the governor of the north\r\ngate presented a petition to this high court of the empire, offered\r\nhimself as Mr. Judson's security, obtained his release, and took him to\r\nhis house, where he treated him with every possible kindness, and to\r\nwhich I was removed as soon as returning health would allow.\r\n\r\n\"The rapid strides of the English army towards the capital at this time,\r\nthrew the whole town into the greatest state of alarm, and convinced the\r\ngovernment that some speedy measures must be taken to save the golden\r\ncity. They had hitherto rejected all the overtures of Sir Archibald\r\nCampbell, imagining, until this late period, that they could in some way\r\nor other, drive the English from the country. Mr. Judson and Dr. Price\r\nwere daily called to the court-house and consulted; in fact, nothing was\r\ndone without their approbation. Two English officers, also, who had\r\nlately been brought to Ava as prisoners, were continually consulted, and\r\ntheir good offices requested in endeavouring to persuade the British\r\nGeneral to make peace on easier terms. It was finally concluded that Mr.\r\nJudson and one of the officers above-mentioned, should be sent\r\nimmediately to the English camp, in order to negotiate. The danger\r\nattached to a situation so responsible, under a government so fickle as\r\nthe Burmese, induced your brother to use every means possible to prevent\r\nhis being sent. Dr. Price was not only willing, but desirous of going;\r\nthis circumstance Mr. Judson represented to the members of government,\r\nand begged he might not be compelled to go, as Dr. Price could transact\r\nthis business equally as well as himself. After some hesitation and\r\ndeliberation, Dr. Price was appointed to accompany Dr. Sandford, one of\r\nthe English officers, on condition that Mr. Judson would stand security\r\nfor his return; while the other English officer, then in irons, should\r\nbe security for Dr. Sandford. The king gave them a hundred tickals each,\r\nto bear their expenses, (twenty-five of which Dr. Sandford generously\r\nsent to Mr. Gouger, still a prisoner at Oung-pen-la,) boats, men, and a\r\nBurmese officer, to accompany them, though he ventured no farther than\r\nthe Burman camp. With the most anxious solicitude the court waited the\r\narrival of the messengers, but did not in the least relax in their\r\nexertions to fortify the city. Men and beasts were at work night and\r\nday, making new stockades and strengthening old ones, and whatever\r\nbuildings were in their way were immediately torn down. Our house, with\r\nall that surrounded it, was levelled to the ground, and our beautiful\r\nlittle compound turned into a road and a place for the erection of\r\ncannon. All articles of value were conveyed out of town and safely\r\ndeposited in some other place.\r\n\r\n\"At length the boat in which the ambassadors had been sent was seen\r\napproaching a day earlier than was expected. As it advanced towards the\r\ncity, the banks were lined by thousands, anxiously inquiring their\r\nsuccess. But no answer was given--the government must first hear the\r\nnews. The palace gates were crowded, the officers at the Tlowtdau were\r\nseated, when Dr. Price made the following communication: 'The general\r\nand commissioners will make no alteration in their terms, except the\r\nhundred lacks (a lack is a hundred thousand) of rupees, may be paid at\r\nfour different times. The first twenty-five lacks to be paid within\r\ntwelve days, or the army will continue their march.' In addition to\r\nthis, the prisoners were to be given up immediately. The general had\r\ncommissioned Dr. Price to demand Mr. Judson and myself and little Maria.\r\nThis was communicated to the king, who replied, 'They are not English,\r\nthey are my people, and shall not go.' At this time, I had no idea that\r\nwe should ever be released from Ava. The government had learned the\r\nvalue of your brother's services, having employed him the last three\r\nmonths; and we both concluded they would never consent to our departure.\r\nThe foreigners were again called to a consultation, to see what could be\r\ndone. Dr. Price and Mr. Judson told them plainly that the English would\r\nnever make peace on any other terms than those offered, and that it was\r\nin vain to go down again without the money. It was then proposed that a\r\nthird part of the first sum demanded should he sent down immediately.\r\nMr. Judson objected, and still said it would be useless. Some of the\r\nmembers of government then intimated that it was probable the teachers\r\nwere on the side of the English, and did not try to make them take a\r\nsmaller sum; and also threatened if they did not make the English\r\ncomply, they and their families should suffer.\r\n\r\n\"In this interval, the fears of the government were considerably\r\nallayed, by the offers of a general, by name Layarthoo-yah, who desired\r\nto make one more attempt to conquer the English, and disperse them. He\r\nassured the king and government, that he could so fortify the ancient\r\ncity of Pagan, as to make it impregnable; and that he would there defeat\r\nand destroy the English. His offers were heard, he marched to Pagan with\r\na very considerable force, and made strong the fortifications. But the\r\nEnglish took the city with perfect ease, and dispersed the Burmese army;\r\nwhile the general fled to Ava, and had the presumption to appear in the\r\npresence of the king, and demand new troops. The king being enraged that\r\nhe had ever listened to him for a moment, in consequence of which the\r\nnegotiation had been delayed, the English general provoked, and the\r\ntroops daily advancing, that he ordered the general to be immediately\r\nexecuted! The poor fellow was soon hurled from the palace, and beat all\r\nthe way to the court-house--when he was stripped of his rich apparel,\r\nbound with cords, and made to kneel and bow towards the palace. He was\r\nthen delivered into the hands of the executioners, who, by their cruel\r\ntreatment, put an end to his existence, before they reached the place of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n\"The king caused it to be reported, that this general was executed, in\r\nconsequence of disobeying his commands, '_not to fight the English_.'\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Price was sent off the same night, with part of the prisoners, and\r\nwith instructions to persuade the general to take six lacks instead of\r\ntwenty-five. He returned in two or three days with the appalling\r\nintelligence, that the English general was very angry, refused to have\r\nany communication with him, and was now within a few days' march of the\r\ncapital. The queen was greatly alarmed, and said the money should be\r\nraised immediately, if the English would only stop their march. The\r\nwhole palace was in motion, gold and silver vessels were melted up, the\r\nking and queen superintended the weighing of a part of it, and were\r\ndetermined, if possible, to save their city. The silver was ready in the\r\nboats by the next evening; but they had so little confidence in the\r\nEnglish, that after all their alarm, they concluded to send down six\r\nlacks only, with the assurance that if the English would stop where they\r\nthen were, the remainder should be forthcoming immediately.\r\n\r\n\"The government now did not even ask Mr. Judson the question whether he\r\nwould go or not; but some officers took him by the arm as he was walking\r\nin the street, and told him he must go immediately on board the boat, to\r\naccompany two Burmese officers, a Woongyee and Woondouk, who were going\r\ndown to make peace. Most of the English prisoners were sent at the same\r\ntime. The general and commissioners would not receive the six lacks,\r\nneither would they stop their march; but promised, if the sum complete\r\nreached them before they should arrive at Ava, they would make peace.\r\nThe general also commissioned Mr. Judson to collect the remaining\r\nforeigners, of whatever country, and ask the question before the Burmese\r\ngovernment, whether they wished to go or stay. Those who expressed a\r\nwish to go should be delivered up immediately, or peace would not be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Judson reached Ava at midnight; had all the foreigners called the\r\nnext morning, and the question asked. Some of the members of government\r\nsaid to him, 'You will not leave us--you shall become a great man if you\r\nwill remain.' He then secured himself from the odium of saying that he\r\nwished to leave the service of his majesty by recurring to the order of\r\nSir Archibald, that whoever wished to leave Ava should be given up, and\r\nthat I had expressed a wish to go, so that he of course must follow. The\r\nremaining part of the twenty-five lacks was soon collected; the\r\nprisoners at Oung-pen-la were all released, and either sent to their\r\nhouses, or down the river to the English; and in two days from the time\r\nof Mr. Judson's return, we took an affectionate leave of the good\r\nnatured officer who had so long entertained us at his house, and who now\r\naccompanied us to the water side, and we then left forever the banks of\r\nAva.\r\n\r\nIt was on a cool, moonlight evening, in the month of March, that with\r\nhearts filled with gratitude to God, and overflowing with joy at our\r\nprospects, we passed down the Irrawaddy, surrounded by six or eight\r\ngolden boats, and accompanied by all we had on earth. The thought that\r\nwe had still to pass the Burman camp, would sometimes occur to damp our\r\njoy, for we feared that some obstacle might there arise to retard our\r\nprogress. Nor were we mistaken in our conjectures. We reached the camp\r\nabout midnight, where we were detained two hours; the Woongyee, and high\r\nofficers, insisting that _we_ should wait at the camp, while Dr. Price,\r\n(who did not return to Ava with your brother, but remained at the camp,)\r\nshould go on with the money and first ascertain whether peace would be\r\nmade. The Burmese government still entertained the idea, that as soon as\r\nthe English had received the money and prisoners, they would continue\r\ntheir march, and yet destroy the capital. We knew not but that some\r\ncircumstance might occur to break off the negotiations; Mr. Judson,\r\ntherefore strenuously insisted that he would not remain, but go on\r\nimmediately. The officers were finally prevailed on to consent, hoping\r\nmuch from Mr. Judson's assistance in making peace.\r\n\r\n\"We now, for the first time, for more than a year and a half, felt that\r\nwe were free, and no longer subject to the oppressive yoke of the\r\nBurmese. And with what sensations of delight, on the next morning, did I\r\nbehold the masts of the steam-boat, the sure presage of being within the\r\nbounds of civilized life. As soon as our boat reached the shore,\r\nbrigadier A. and another officer came on board, congratulated us on our\r\narrival, and invited us on board the steam-boat, where I passed the\r\nremainder of the day; while your brother went on to meet the general,\r\nwho, with a detachment of the army, had encamped at Yandaboo, a few\r\nmiles further down the river. Mr. Judson returned in the evening, with\r\nan invitation from Sir Archibald, to come immediately to his quarters,\r\nwhere I was the next morning introduced, and received with the greatest\r\nkindness by the general, who had a tent pitched for us near his\r\nown--took us to his own table, and treated us with the kindness of a\r\nfather, rather than as strangers of another country.\r\n\r\n\"We feel that our obligations to general Campbell can never be\r\ncancelled. Our final release from Ava, and our recovering all the\r\nproperty that had there been taken, was owing entirely to his efforts.\r\nThis subsequent hospitality and kind attention to the accommodations for\r\nour passage to Rangoon, have left an indelible impression on our minds,\r\nwhich can never be forgotten. We daily received the congratulation of\r\nthe British officers, whose conduct towards us formed a striking\r\ncontrast to that of the Burmese. I presume to say, that no persons on\r\nearth were ever happier than we were, during the fortnight we passed at\r\nthe English camp. For several days, this single idea wholly occupied my\r\nmind, that we were out of the power of the Burmese government, and once\r\nmore under the protection of the English. Our feelings continually\r\ndictated expressions like these: _What shall we render to the Lord for\r\nall his benefits towards us?_\r\n\r\n\"The treaty of peace was soon concluded, signed by both parties, and a\r\ntermination of hostilities publicly declared. We left Yandaboo, after a\r\nfortnight's residence, and safely reached the mission house in Rangoon,\r\nafter an absence of two years and three months.\r\n\r\n\"A review of our trip to, and adventures in, Ava, often, excites the\r\ninquiry, Why were we permitted to go? What good has been effected? Why\r\ndid I not listen to the advice of friends in Bengal, and remain there\r\ntill the war was concluded? But all that we can say is, _It is not in\r\nman that walketh to direct his steps._ So far as my going round to\r\nRangoon, at the time I did, was instrumental in bringing those heavy\r\nafflictions upon us, I can only say, that if I ever acted from a sense\r\nof duty in my life, it was at that time; for my conscience would not\r\nallow me any peace, when I thought of sending for your brother to come\r\nto Calcutta, in prospect of the approaching war. Our society at home\r\nhave lost no property in consequence of our difficulties; but two years\r\nof precious time have been lost to the mission, unless some future\r\nadvantage may be gained, in consequence of the severe discipline to\r\nwhich we ourselves have been subject. We are sometimes induced to think,\r\nthat the lesson we found so very hard to learn, will have a beneficial\r\neffect through our lives; and that the mission may, in the end, be\r\nadvanced rather than retarded.\r\n\r\n\"We should have had no hesitation about remaining in Ava, if no part of\r\nthe Burmese empire had been ceded to the British. But as it was, we felt\r\nit would be an unnecessary exposure, besides the missionary field being\r\nmuch more limited, in consequence of intoleration. We now consider our\r\nfuture missionary prospects as bright indeed; and our only anxiety is,\r\nto be once more in that situation where our time will be exclusively\r\ndevoted to the instruction of the heathen.\"\r\n\r\nIn a concluding paragraph, dated Amherst, July 27, she adds:\r\n\r\n\"From the date at the commencement of this long letter, you see, my dear\r\nbrother, that my patience has continued for two months. I have\r\nfrequently been induced to throw it aside altogether, but feeling\r\nassured that you and my other friends are expecting something of this\r\nkind I am induced to send it with all its imperfections. This letter,\r\ndreadful as are the scenes herein described, gives you but a faint idea\r\nof the awful reality. The anguish, the agony of mind, resulting from a\r\nthousand little circumstances impossible to delineate on paper, can be\r\nknown by those only who have been in similar situations. Pray for us, my\r\ndear brother and sister, that these heavy afflictions may not be in\r\nvain, but may be blessed to our spiritual good, and the advancement of\r\nChrist's church among the heathen.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of this long and melancholy narrative, we may appropriately\r\nintroduce the following tribute to the benevolence and talents of Mrs.\r\nJudson, written by one of the English prisoners, who were confined at\r\nAva with Mr. Judson. It was published in a Calcutta paper after the\r\nconclusion of the war:\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Judson was the author of those eloquent and forcible appeals to\r\nthe government, which prepared them by degrees for submission to terms\r\nof peace, never expected by any, who knew the hauteur and inflexible\r\npride of the Burman court.\r\n\r\n\"And while on this subject, the overflowing of grateful feelings, on\r\nbehalf of myself and fellow-prisoners, compel me to add a tribute of\r\npublic thanks to that amiable and humane female, who, though living at a\r\ndistance of two miles from our prison, without any means of conveyance,\r\nand very feeble in health, forgot her own comfort and infirmity, and\r\nalmost every day visited us, sought out and administered to our wants,\r\nand contributed in every way to alleviate our misery.\r\n\r\n\"While we were left by the government destitute of food, she, with\r\nunwearied perseverance, by some means or other, obtained for us a\r\nconstant supply.\r\n\r\n\"When the tattered state of our clothes evinced the extremity of our\r\ndistress, she was ever ready to replenish our scanty wardrobe.\r\n\r\n\"When the unfeeling avarice of our keepers confined us inside, or made\r\nour feet fast in the stocks, she, like a ministering angel, never ceased\r\nher applications to the government, until she was authorized to\r\ncommunicate to us the grateful news of our enlargement, or of a respite\r\nfrom our galling oppressions.\r\n\r\n\"Besides all this, it was unquestionably owing, in a chief degree, to\r\nthe repeated eloquence, and forcible appeals of Mrs. Judson, that the\r\nuntutored Burman was finally made willing to secure the welfare and\r\nhappiness of his country, by a sincere peace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nPERSECUTION OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARIES IN THE WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exertions of Christians to spread the truths of the gospel among the\r\nAfricans in the West Indies, have met with much opposition from the\r\nwhite population. Moravian missionaries, at first, sold themselves as\r\nslaves, and laboured with the negroes on the plantations for the purpose\r\nof preaching the gospel during the intervals of labour. The Methodist\r\nmissionaries have been treated with much indignity, and have had their\r\nlives endangered by the violence of the white mob. In 1816, the white\r\nrabble of Barbadoes, collected together, and totally destroyed the\r\nMethodist chapel. The destruction of the chapel occupied two successive\r\nnights, and so listless were the authorities, that no attempt was made\r\nto prevent it. And when the governor issued a proclamation, offering a\r\nreward to any person who should apprehend the leaders in this outrageous\r\nproceeding, the mob immediately issued a counter proclamation,\r\nthreatening with death any one who should dare to comply with the\r\ngovernor's orders.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1823, an insurrection took place at Demerara, among the\r\nnegroes, which was most unjustly attributed to the efforts of the\r\nmissionaries. The principal events in relation to this affair are\r\ndetailed in the subjoined account from the Missionary Herald.\r\n\r\nVarious accounts have, from time to time, appeared in the public prints,\r\nof the insurrection of the slaves in the colony of Demerara, and of the\r\ncondemnation of the Rev. Mr. Smith, a missionary from the London\r\nMissionary Society, on an accusation of having been accessary to the\r\nplot. We have collected and embodied such of the leading facts, relative\r\nto these transactions, as have come to our knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe slaves of many plantations on the eastern coast of Demerara had\r\nformed a conspiracy to obtain their freedom. The plot was disclosed by a\r\nservant to his master on the 18th of August; not till the conspiracy was\r\nthoroughly organized, and arrangements made to secure simultaneous\r\nmovements; and only a few hours before the time appointed for action.\r\nInformation was immediately communicated to the commander-in-chief, and\r\nthe most efficient measures taken; but before a sufficient force could\r\nbe assembled to resist a large body of negroes, who were immediately\r\nunder arms, the evening, which was the time for executing the first\r\ngrand enterprise, had arrived. This was simultaneously to seize upon the\r\nwhites at the different plantations, confine them in the stocks, and\r\ntake possession of their arms. This was effected on nearly fifty\r\nplantations, containing, inclusive of women and children, 10 or 12,000\r\nnegroes. The whites, to the number of about 250, were imprisoned. In\r\nsome places an ineffectual resistance was made, and several lives lost\r\non both sides.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 19th, the governor issued a proclamation,\r\ndeclaring the colony under martial law, and ordered all who were capable\r\nof bearing arms, without distinction, to be immediately enrolled. The\r\nmost vigorous measures were pursued; and in the course of a few days,\r\nafter several skirmishes, in which a considerable number of negroes lost\r\ntheir lives, the insurrection was subdued.\r\n\r\nA court martial was then constituted, and many of the negroes brought to\r\ntrial, condemned and executed. Subsequent accounts state that more than\r\n1000 had suffered death, in consequence of the insurrection, and that\r\nmany of their heads had been fixed up on poles in various parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe might easily be more particular in regard to the circumstances of the\r\ninsurrection, but our object is chiefly to relate what concerns the\r\nmissionary who was accused of having a part in the scheme, and the other\r\nmissionaries in the colony. On these points we have to regret that the\r\ninformation which has yet been received is very scanty and in many\r\nrespects indefinite.\r\n\r\nThe extract which follows is from the Missionary Chronicle, and was\r\npublished in the name of the Directors of the London Missionary Society.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection it should seem, manifested itself first in Mahaica, the\r\ndistrict to the east of that in which Mr. Smith resides. Its appearance\r\non the Le Ressouvenir estate, where Mr. Smith resides, was on Monday,\r\nthe 18th August, in consequence of an order to take into custody two\r\nslaves belonging to an adjoining plantation, whom the negroes of the Le\r\nRessouvenir, as the prisoners had to pass over it, rose to rescue. Mr.\r\nSmith was at home. He successfully used his endeavours, on perceiving\r\nthe tumult, to rescue the manager from the negroes, and continued his\r\nexertions to induce them to return to their duty, till he himself was\r\ndriven with violence, and with a weapon held to his body, from the\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith was taken into custody on the evening of the 21st August, and\r\nall his papers seized. He is kept a prisoner in the Colony-house, and\r\nhas, since the 24th of August, had a guard stationed over him.\r\n\r\nMr. Elliot, another missionary, who laboured about 20 miles from Mr.\r\nSmith, was also taken into custody, on the ground of disobedience of\r\norders, \"which he had not understood to be such,\" in visiting Mr. Smith\r\nin his confinement. He was kept about ten days, and then released. No\r\ncharge was preferred against him. The estates on which he labours had\r\nbeen quiet, and none of the negroes under his instructions were\r\nimplicated in the rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the Directors of the London Missionary Society, Mr Elliot\r\nwrites thus:\r\n\r\nNumerous false reports have been sent forth against Mr. Smith, but\r\nassure yourself and all the directors, that whatever reports you may\r\nhear, the only crime the missionaries have committed is their zeal for\r\nthe conversion of the negroes. _They have neither been so weak nor so\r\nwicked as to excite the negroes to rebellion._ The missionaries want\r\njustice only; they have no favour to ask; they have nothing to fear. The\r\nmissionaries have not degraded their holy calling, nor dishonoured the\r\nsociety of which they are members, by sowing the seeds of rebellion\r\ninstead of the Word of Life. The real causes of the rebellion are far,\r\nvery far from being the instructions given by the missionaries.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of October, Mr. Smith was brought to trial before a _court\r\nmartial_. All the accounts which we have yet seen of the charges brought\r\nagainst him are very obscure and imperfect. The January number of the\r\nMissionary Chronicle, from which we have already quoted, says,--\r\n\r\nThe public papers have stated four charges as forming the indictment\r\nagainst him, but of their accuracy the directors are not enabled to\r\njudge. They trust that, under the direction of Divine Providence, he has\r\nbeen able to prove himself _guiltless_ of them all.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, to be concealed, that he will have had much to\r\ncontend with from the violence of public prejudice in the Colony, and it\r\nis to be feared from the false assertions of some of the unhappy\r\nnegroes, whom the hope of favour towards themselves may have led to\r\nbring against him \"things that he knew not.\" Indeed, the directors are\r\ninformed, upon authority on which they can rely, that some of the\r\ncondemned negroes, finding the hope of life taken away, had in the most\r\nsolemn manner declared that they had been induced so to act; and that\r\nothers, on being questioned whether they had not been induced to\r\nrebellion by Mr. Smith, had in the strongest terms which their broken\r\nlanguage could supply, denied the imputation. It is stated by the writer\r\nof one letter, that he has often heard charges circulated against the\r\nmissionaries, as if spoken by the negroes at the time of their\r\nexecution, which he knew, (for he was a near spectator,) that they never\r\nhad uttered.\r\n\r\nWe can as yet learn little more respecting the evidence which was\r\nproduced before the court than that some of the negroes testified that\r\nthe instructions of Mr. Smith had a tendency to make them dissatisfied\r\nwith their condition, and that he knew of the plot before it was carried\r\ninto execution.\r\n\r\nHe was condemned, and sentenced to _death_. The sentence was however\r\ntransmitted by the governor, to England, for the consideration and\r\nultimate decision of the king. What we know of the decision will be seen\r\nin the following paragraph, copied from the New-York Observer of March\r\n27th.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the London papers, that \"the king has remitted the\r\nsentence of death of the court martial on Mr. Smith, the missionary of\r\nthe London Society in Demerara, (which sentence was accompanied by a\r\nrecommendation for mercy on the part of the court,) but has given orders\r\nthat he should be dismissed from the colony, and should come under\r\nobligations not to reside within any of his majesty's colonial\r\npossessions in the West Indies.\" The charges against Mr. Smith appear to\r\nhave originated in the perjury of some of the negroes engaged in the\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Mr. Smith was languishing under the influence of\r\ndisease, which rendered the stroke of the executioner unnecessary to\r\nremove him from the earth. He died in prison, before the intelligence\r\nhad arrived that his sentence was reversed. The following notice of his\r\ndeath appeared in the Demerara Courant.\r\n\r\n_Died,_--In the Colonial Jail, at Demerara, February 9th, where he had\r\nbeen confined, as a state prisoner since the 26th of November last, on\r\nthe termination of his trial by the general court martial, on a charge\r\nof high treason, sentence thereon having been transmitted to his majesty\r\nfor his final decision--JOHN SMITH, missionary; he had been in a poor\r\nstate of health, and had been attended regularly by skilful physicians.\r\nWe are happy to state, from personal inquiry and inspection, that this\r\nunhappy man had the utmost attention and kindness shewn to him, by the\r\nhumane keeper of the prison, (Mr. Padmore,) all the time of his\r\nconfinement. His apartment was airy and commodious, he had always at his\r\ncommand every comfort which his taste fancied or his necessities\r\nrequired. He has left a widow to deplore his fate, and deplore his loss.\r\n\r\nThe conviction which results from the present state of our information\r\non this subject, is that, through prejudice and exasperated feeling, Mr.\r\nSmith was condemned, being innocent. The directors of the society under\r\nwhich he laboured, have, however, given us reason to look for further\r\nintelligence in a future number of the Missionary Chronicler, which we\r\nhope will soon arrive.\r\n\r\nIt appears that none of the negroes under the instruction of any\r\nmissionary, either of the London or Wesleyan Missionary Society except\r\nMr. Smith, were implicated in the insurrection. Respecting the\r\nMethodists in the colony we quote the following statement from the\r\nWesleyan Methodist Magazine:\r\n\r\nWe stated in our last number, that Messrs. Mortier and Cheesewright, our\r\nmissionaries in Demerara were safe, and that _only_ two of the members\r\nof our society there had been apprehended on suspicion of being\r\nimplicated in the late revolt. We have received a second letter from Mr.\r\nMortier, dated Demerara, September seventeenth, which communicated the\r\ngratifying intelligence that these two persons, who were servants of the\r\ngovernor, had been liberated upon full conviction of their entire\r\ninnocence, and that _no one_ of the members of our large society of\r\ntwelve hundred and sixteen, chiefly slaves, had been in the least\r\nconcerned in the revolt: and that the slaves of another estate, under\r\nthe care of Mr. Cheesewright, had not only refused to join the rebels,\r\nbut had conducted their master to a vessel, by which he reached\r\nGeorgetown in safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Case of Rev. John Smith._\r\n\r\nThe London Missionary Chronicle for March contains a statement\r\nrespecting Mr. Smith's case, occupying, with accompanying documents\r\nnearly twelve pages, which confirms the impression that Mr. Smith was\r\ninnocent. The Directors of the London Missionary Society, after stating\r\nsome circumstances relative to his trial, says.\r\n\r\nThe Directors having stated these points of serious objection (and more\r\nmight easily be found,) to the proceedings on the trial, conclude that\r\nthe members of the society, and the candid beyond its circle, will\r\napprove of their declaring that they retain the conviction formerly\r\nexpressed, of the moral and legal innocence of their missionary, Smith;\r\nthat they do not withdraw from him their confidence; and that they are\r\n\"not ashamed of his bonds.\" They regard him as an unmerited sufferer, in\r\nthe diligent and faithful, and it may be added, useful discharge of his\r\nduties, as a missionary; and they earnestly wish the Divine forgiveness\r\nmay be extended to those who may have been instrumental in causing his\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Austin, a clergyman of the church of England, and Chaplain\r\nof the Colony, thus expresses his opinion in a private letter.\r\n\r\n\"I feel no hesitation in declaring, from the intimate knowledge which my\r\nmost anxious inquiries have obtained, that in the late scourge which the\r\nhand of an all-wise Creator has inflicted on this ill-fated country,\r\nnothing but those religious impressions which, under Providence, Mr.\r\nSmith has been instrumental in fixing--nothing but those principles of\r\nthe gospel of peace which he has been proclaiming--could have prevented\r\na dreadful effusion of blood here, and saved the lives of these very\r\npersons who are now (I shudder to write it,) seeking his.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract of a letter from William Arrindell, Esq. of\r\nDemerara, Mr. Smith's counsel, addressed to Mrs. Smith, after the trial,\r\nis also inserted.\r\n\r\n\"It is almost presumptuous in me to differ from the sentence of a Court,\r\nbut, before God, I do believe Mr. Smith to be innocent; nay, I will go\r\nfurther, and defy any minister, of any sect whatever, to have shewn a\r\nmore faithful attention to his sacred duties, than he has been proved,\r\nby the evidence on his trial, to have done.\"\r\n\r\nThe Directors had resolved to take further measures for obtaining, in\r\nEngland the reversal of his sentence.\r\n\r\nThis subject was brought before the English parliament, and after a full\r\nand fair discussion, the innocence of Mr. Smith was established beyond a\r\nquestion. The following from the London Christian Observer gives an\r\naccount of the proceedings in Parliament.\r\n\r\nA debate of two days' continuance on the case of the missionary Smith\r\nhas taken place in the House of Commons. A motion was made by Mr.\r\nBrougham, to express the serious alarm and deep sorrow with which the\r\nhouse contemplated the violation of law and justice, manifested in the\r\nunexampled proceedings against Mr. Smith in Demerara, and their sense of\r\nthe necessity of adopting measures to secure a just and humane\r\nadministration of law in that colony, and to protect the voluntary\r\ninstruction of the negroes, as well as the negroes themselves, and the\r\nrest of his Majesty's subjects from oppression. This motion was\r\nsupported by Mr. Brougham with a power of argument and eloquence which\r\nhas seldom been equalled; and he was followed on the same side by Sir\r\nJames Mackintosh, Dr. Lushington, Mr. J Williams, Mr. Wilberforce, Mr.\r\nDenman, and Sir Joseph Yorke. The motion was opposed by Mr. Horton, Mr.\r\nScarlett, Mr. Tindal, the Attorney General, and Mr. Canning, on the\r\nground, not of the legality of the proceedings, or of the justice of the\r\nsentence, but that the motion went to condemn unheard the governor of\r\nDemerara, and the court that tried Mr. Smith. On this ground the\r\nprevious question was moved and carried by 193 to 146, the largest\r\nminority in the present session. The division, under all the\r\ncircumstances of the case may be considered as a triumph. Not an\r\nindividual attempted to defend the proceedings. In short, nothing could\r\nhave been more decisive of the innocence of Mr. Smith, and the injustice\r\nof his condemnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecutions of the Wesleyan Methodists in St. Domingo._\r\n\r\nWe extract from the publications of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, the\r\nfollowing account of the aggressions committed upon the Protestant\r\npopulation of Hayti, by the Roman Catholics of that Island, during the\r\nyear 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecutions at Port au Prince._\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the journal of Mr. St. Denis, and letters of\r\nMr. Pressoir, members of the Methodist Society at Port au Prince, we\r\ncopied from the Wesleyan Magazine. The first extracts are from the\r\njournal of Mr. St. Denis.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, Feb. 2d, our assembly was held at Belair. During the morning\r\nservice several stones were thrown.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 4._ Whilst we were singing, a shower of stones was thrown, but no\r\none received any injury.\r\n\r\nThat evening (Feb. 7th) we had a small assembly of thirty-two persons. A\r\nplan had been laid for apprehending us, which was put in execution. We\r\nhad time to sing a hymn, read a chapter, and a homily; but whilst\r\nsinging the second hymn, the noise of the soldiers was so great in\r\napproaching our house of prayer, that we were obliged to cease singing.\r\nWishing, however, to continue our meeting, an officer of the police\r\nsaid, \"In the name of the law, leave off that prayer!\" Then we left off.\r\nNot finding J. C. Pressoir, they made me his second. We were taken to\r\ngeneral Thomas's, who pretended to be ignorant of the matter. Colonel\r\nVictor pretended to be ignorant also. When we reached the house of the\r\n_Juge de Paix_, we were ordered to halt for a moment. Colonel Victor\r\nknocked at his door, the _Juge de Paix_ asked who we were, and was\r\nanswered, \"A band of methodists.\" The _Juge de Paix_ said, \"Ha! ha! take\r\nthem to the jail!\" Col. Victor replied, \"Yes!\" We were led to prison,\r\nand each of our names was taken. The sisters were put in the debtor's\r\nplace, and the men were shut up in close confinement.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the person who keeps the keys of the prison under the\r\njailer told us, that the Juge de Paix would not allow our door to be\r\nopened; but the jailer went and spoke respecting it, and our door was\r\nopened about nine o'clock. A moment after the Juge de Paix came to visit\r\nus, and addressing himself to me in anger, I wished to reply: he would\r\nnot listen to me; but began to blaspheme religion, despising the Lord.\r\nHe withdrew in anger, without being able to do any thing with us. A\r\nmoment after he left us, we were taken into the debtor's prison, near to\r\nthe sisters, in a separate chamber.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pressoir heard of this event, he visited his brethren at the\r\nprison. The following extract is from one of his letters.\r\n\r\nI would not run into prison of my own accord, but having waited, and\r\nfinding nothing was said to us, I went to see my brethren and sisters. I\r\nfound there were thirty-two, and St. Denis preparing to write to the\r\npresident, which he did, and I carried this letter to his excellency, by\r\nwhich we requested him to cause us to be judged, and punished, if we\r\nwere found guilty by the law. When I arrived under the piazza of the\r\npalace, I asked an officer on duty if I could see the president, who\r\nanswered, Yes. I entered the hall, where I found the president seated,\r\nand surrounded by a circle, as well of officers as civilians. After\r\nsaluting them, I presented the letter to the president, who asked me\r\nfrom whence it came. I replied, \"From the methodists who are in prison.\"\r\nHis good humour was immediately changed. \"Methodists,\" said he, \"I did\r\nnot know that.\" Colonel Victor, who was present, thinking that through\r\nfear I would wish to conceal myself, addressed himself to the president,\r\nsaying, \"President, this is a methodist,\" as if the president did not\r\nknow it. Immediately the president replied, \"You are fanatics.\" \"Pardon\r\nme, president, we are not.\" \"Why, you have changed your religion.\" \"If I\r\nhave changed my religion, president, it is the government which has made\r\nme do it.\" \"How is that?\" said he. \"It was the late president who sent\r\nfor the missionaries. I heard the letter read, and saw the late\r\npresident's signature: this is what I can tell you.\" \"Enough, enough,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I will send an answer.\" I went to the prison and waited till\r\nit was late; but hearing nothing, and being ill of the fever, I returned\r\nto my mother's.\r\n\r\nThe next day orders were given for the brethren and sisters to appear\r\nbefore the chief judge. A dollar was demanded of each on leaving prison,\r\nand they were conducted by a single serjeant. On their arrival the chief\r\njudge forbade them, in the name of the president, to assemble together\r\nagain. \"No one can hinder you from worshipping God as you please; but\r\nlet every one abide at home, for as often as you are found assembled you\r\nshall be put in prison; and if you unhappily persist, I have received\r\norders to disperse you every where.\" Several wished to reply, but he\r\nrefused to listen, saying, \"It is not from me; it is not my fault; these\r\norders are given me.\" All our brethren and sisters went out, animated\r\nwith a holy zeal, determining not to abandon their assemblies. The next\r\nday we were assembled. After an exhortation we sung a hymn which being\r\nfinished, we kneeled down to pray: a shower of stones came, as if they\r\nwould have demolished the house, and have stoned us like Stephen. With\r\none accord we commended ourselves to our faithful Creator, and continued\r\nin prayer till they had ceased.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter, dated July 31st, he writes:--\r\n\r\nSince the Lord has granted us the favour of meeting again, we have\r\ncontinued our assemblies without intermission, although forbidden to do\r\nthis under pain of prison and exile. The only interruption we meet with\r\nis bad words, and a few stones now and then; and I am become so marked,\r\nthat I cannot go out without people crying after me, \"Methodist!\r\nParson!\"--with a contemptuous sneer, and a thousand other things not fit\r\nto write, but which serve only to strengthen my faith in the promises of\r\nHim who is faithful; till last Sunday some foolish young women came to\r\nrevile us; and on Tuesday evening, whilst reading, stones were thrown,\r\nand whilst we were at prayer a great number rushed in, armed with\r\nsabres, sticks, and, if I mistake not, with stones, crying out, \"In the\r\nname of the law,\" as if they had been authorized by the heads of the\r\npeople to arrest us. This band consisted of boys, led on to commit\r\ndisorders by a set of idle, good-for-nothing persons, of the worst\r\nclass, who had armed themselves with sabres, and were disguised with old\r\ncocked hats; trying thus to show their bravery over those who would make\r\nno resistance. But the hairs of our head are all numbered; nor have they\r\nbeen permitted to hurt any of us to the present. It would be useless for\r\nus to ask or hope for the protection of the law; and we are thus led to\r\nplace all our confidence in God, who can and will deliver us in his\r\ntime. And if the Lord is for me, of whom should I be afraid? He that\r\nspared not his own Son, but delivered him up for me, will he not with\r\nhim freely give me all things? I have already experienced that all my\r\nsufferings for his name are great blessings to me. All my care is about\r\nHis church; and what wisdom does it require to conduct so many persons\r\nof such different dispositions! I feel new wants daily.\r\n\r\nThe following brief view of the persecutions of the methodists, in\r\nHayti, is taken from \"Missionary Notices,\" published by the Wesleyan\r\nMissionary Society. This account gave some particulars in addition to\r\nthose narrated in the details inserted above:\r\n\r\nWe regret to find,--say the committee of that society,--from the\r\nfollowing letter received from Mr. Pressoir, that our poor persecuted\r\nsociety at Port-au-Prince, so long the object of popish rancour, has\r\nagain had to sustain the brutal outrages of an ignorant mob, incited it\r\nwould seem, in another place, by persons calling themselves\r\n\"respectable,\" and without experiencing any protection from the local\r\nauthorities. The committee have endeavoured to obtain for them the\r\ncommon protection of the laws of their own country, by applications\r\nthrough various quarters, and hope they may be ultimately successful. In\r\nthe mean time this excellent and suffering people are entitled to the\r\nspecial sympathies, and earnest prayers, of the friends of missions. We\r\ntrust that they may yet, by their meek and patient suffering, and heroic\r\nperseverance, obtain that liberty of worship which they so earnestly\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nThe letter from Mr. Pressoir is dated about a year since. The following\r\nextracts describe the violence of the mob:\r\n\r\nI have read of many instances of martyrdom for the testimony of Jesus\r\nChrist, but I have not yet read a passage which relates that the people\r\nof a city rose up like murderers, with a very few exceptions, to stone a\r\nfew persons met together in a house, as our fathers, mothers, brethren,\r\nand children have done unto us not long ago. O cruel people! They began\r\nto throw stones at us at five o'clock in the afternoon, and continued\r\ntheir assaults till ten o'clock, committing all kinds of violence. They\r\nbroke down the doors, broke open the windows, destroyed the first and\r\nsecond partitions in the upper chambers; in a word, every thing that was\r\nin the house, and beat with their cowskin-whips the brethren and sisters\r\nthere, without showing compassion for either age or youth or even\r\ninfancy. I believe I suffered the least of any. Only a great emissary of\r\nSatan, seized my left hand, and lifting up his whip declared he would\r\nknock me down, if I did not say \"Almighty God, the Virgin Mary.\" My only\r\nanswer was, turning my back. Several times he even brought his whip to\r\nmy neck, and afterwards laid it on my shoulder, raging and abusing me\r\nwith all the fury of Anti-christ. But he that numbered my hairs did not\r\nallow one of them to fall to the ground. Thanks be to him for confidence\r\nin his holy word, which is firmer than heaven on earth. When the\r\npopulace entered to knock down our sisters I was in the first chamber,\r\nand hearing their cries, I tried to force my way to them, to try if I\r\ncould render them any assistance; then the tyrant persecutor struck me\r\nseveral times on my hat, but I received no injury. But we were in great\r\ndanger; those who wished to go out were stoned, beaten, torn, outraged,\r\nand brought back to the house, where they exercised their dark cruelty.\r\nIt appeared as if Satan was unchained, and had come forth to make war\r\nagainst those whom the truth of the gospel had made free, and to crush\r\nthose who had believed the testimony of the Son of God.\r\n\r\nI ask, then, by whom have we been protected, and delivered unto this\r\nday? Was it by magistrates, judges, and police officers? Or by the other\r\nguards appointed to appease riots and defend the law? It is true, they\r\nwere present in great numbers, but it was rather to advise and direct\r\nothers. Some brought barrows full of stones, and others threw them, and\r\nsaid to the cruel populace, that, since we were so obstinate, the\r\ngovernment had given us into their hands, and they might do to us\r\nwhatever they pleased; and they did treat us with inhumanity and the\r\ngreatest violence.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to go out without being beaten, stoned, dragged,\r\nabused, and covered with dirt, and in the end we could neither buy nor\r\nsell without being dragged before a magistrate, beat, and covered with\r\nspitting and mud, and all kinds of outrages. They went beyond Porte\r\nMarchant to brother Floran's, sister Claire's, and J. P. J. Lusant's. At\r\nbrother Floran's they destroyed every thing in the garden, and treated\r\nhis wife, already broken with age, with the greatest inhumanity;\r\ndragging sister Claire by her feet out of the house, as also her\r\ngod-daughter. And at J. P. J. Lusant's what disorders have they not\r\ncommitted amongst those poor persons, who have fled from the town to\r\nhave some tranquility. I must tell you one circumstance which J. P. J.\r\nL. told me, to show you the cowardice of persecutors; five or six of\r\nthem entered his gate, concealing their swords, making up to him with\r\nloud vociferations; seeing them coming, he went into his house, took an\r\nold rusty musket without flint, and levelling it at them, they all\r\ninstantly fled with all speed, saying, \"The Quakers don't carry arms,\r\nand see this old Quaker hero intends killing us.\"\r\n\r\nAlluding to the letter of Mr. Pressoir, above noticed, and to other\r\ncommunications received about the same time, the Wesleyan Committee\r\nremark, in their publication for July, 1824.\r\n\r\nIn a recent number we laid before our readers some extracts of letters\r\nfrom our afflicted and persecuted society at Port-au-Prince, Hayti; from\r\nwhich it appeared that several of them had again been called to suffer\r\nbonds for the cause of Christ; that the house in which they were in the\r\nhabit of assembling for religious worship was demolished; and that they\r\nthemselves were delivered up to the will of a blind and infuriated\r\npopulace, the magistrates refusing to afford them any protection against\r\nthe outrages to which they were daily exposed. From later communications\r\nwe learn, that, on an appeal being made by letter to the president,\r\nthose in prison were set at liberty; and that a proclamation was made\r\nby his excellency's orders, forbidding any one to stone, injure, or\r\notherwise persecute the methodists, but at the same time prohibiting all\r\nmeetings of our society for religious worship; on pain of being\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above proclamation, our people have still to suffer,\r\nin various ways, the insults and persecutions of the rabble. They\r\ncontinue, as they are able, and can find opportunity, to meet together\r\nfor prayer, &c.\r\n\r\nThe letter to president Boyer shows very clearly the pacific character\r\nand object of these protestants. It is too important a part of these\r\ndocuments to be omitted.\r\n\r\nPresident,--You are acquainted with our society, formed here six years\r\nago. The end of our meeting together is, to invoke the blessing of God,\r\nnot only on ourselves, but also on the government, its magistrates, and\r\neven on those who evil entreat us without cause; for we do not hate\r\nthem, nor render evil for evil. This is what our religion commands. It\r\nis not that we wish by our meetings to disobey our president; but our\r\ndesire is to obey God our sovereign, and his law requires that we should\r\nlove the head that he has placed over us.\r\n\r\nWe know that your excellency will not approve the conduct of those who\r\nhave stoned and evil entreated us without cause. We have been treated as\r\nenemies to the government, yet are not such. Yesterday we were arrested\r\nand put in prison, by order of general Thomas, who at once without\r\nexamination, pronounced our sentence. And we know this was not by order\r\nof the president, which renders it our indisputable duty to give you\r\ninformation thereof.\r\n\r\nPresident, let our society be narrowly examined, and if fault is found\r\nin us, we are willing to suffer the punishment we merit.\r\n\r\nConfidently expecting your favourable reply, we have the honour of\r\nsaluting you most respectfully.\r\n\r\nTo this letter the president did not reply, but ordered those, who had\r\nbeen arrested, to be set at liberty. Ten days after the date of the\r\nletter to the president, a letter was written, from which the following\r\nparagraphs are taken. The concluding sentences open the way for putting\r\na favourable construction on the intentions of the president.\r\n\r\nA proclamation was made in the name of general Thomas, commandant of the\r\nplace, to prevent any one from throwing stones at the methodists,\r\nforbidding every one to evil entreat them, or to go before their houses\r\nto insult them. But by that proclamation we were also forbidden to meet\r\ntogether, and informed that should we meet, the police is ordered to\r\narrest us; but as for the people, they ought not to interfere, nor throw\r\nstones, because we are citizens of the republic. This is the substance\r\nof the proclamation.\r\n\r\nAlthough this proclamation was made, yet the people did not cease to ill\r\ntreat us, and cry after us, as we went along. General Thomas gets out of\r\nthat affair by saying, that they only made use of his name when he had\r\nnothing to do in it. \"But, take care,\" said he, \"if that continue, that\r\nit do not cost the life of some one.\"\r\n\r\nOne of our sisters visited the president, to whom she made her\r\ncomplaints, and informed him that it was said, that it was by his order\r\nthat these things were done. He received her very politely, assured her\r\nthat this was not so, but that he was exceedingly sorry that we should\r\nbe improperly treated, and that he had written to general Thomas to that\r\neffect, and if the general did not attend to his orders he could not\r\nhold any command in the republic. In consequence of this the general\r\nmade the above proclamation. The president also told her, that he could\r\nnot allow us to hold our meetings, because we were not in peace; that\r\nFrance was proposing to march upon us, &c. &c. Since the last\r\npersecution, we enjoy, by the grace of God, the means of praying, when\r\nseveral of us meet together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nPERSECUTIONS IN SWITZERLAND FROM 1813 TO 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information contained in the following account of the persecution in\r\nSwitzerland, is derived principally from the Christian Spectator and the\r\nLondon Christian Observer.\r\n\r\nScarcely any country of Continental Europe, has excited so deep an\r\ninterest in the minds of Americans, as Switzerland. Its valleys and\r\nlakes, its streams and cataracts, its lofty mountains and the seas of\r\nice and deserts of snow which crown their summits, have been the Ultima\r\nThule of the traveller, from whatever land. But _we_ have dwelt upon\r\nthem from the very days of boyhood, with an interest belonging to\r\nscarcely any thing earthly, because we regarded all this magnificent and\r\nbeautiful display, as the mere scenery and decoration of the stage, on\r\nwhich an important act in the great drama of liberty, was exhibited. In\r\nthe christian, these magnificent objects awaken emotions perhaps less\r\ntumultuous, but deeper and more elevating; for it is here that another\r\nscene of that great drama was early opened, involving interests\r\nincomparably more valuable, and a struggle far more deadly, not for the\r\ncivil liberty of Switzerland, but to free the world from a tyranny, in\r\ncomparison with which, that of Austrian dukes was paternal kindness,--a\r\ndespotism that held the soul itself chained to the papal throne, and\r\nassumed the triple crown of heaven and earth and hell, which its\r\nrepresentative still wears. To the christian, the names of Tell and\r\nWinkelreid, sink into insignificance beside those of Zuingle and Calvin;\r\nand the war of Swiss independence scarcely deserves a thought, in\r\ncomparison with that struggle for the moral reformation of the world,\r\nin which these men were such distinguished actors, and to whose\r\ninfluence we ourselves owe that religious liberty, which is the most\r\nprecious part of our birthright.\r\n\r\nBut it is an humbling reflection, that the palladium of liberty could\r\nnot be kept inviolate, even in the fastnesses of the Alps. A few years\r\nonly have elapsed, since some of the fairest portions of this \"land of\r\nthe free,\" were held as conquered tributaries by other cantons, and were\r\ngoverned by a bailiff residing in his castle, and exercising a power\r\nlike that of a feudal baron. A considerable portion of Switzerland is\r\nstill subject to an aristocracy, as absolute in its sway, and as much\r\nopposed to the extension of light and liberty, as any other branch of\r\nthe holy alliance. The press is, in many cantons, under severe\r\nrestrictions, and industry and enterprise are checked by the regulations\r\nof the incorporated _trades_, which place the rod of oppression in the\r\nhands of ignorance and self-interest; and which bring home its influence\r\nto the work-bench of the mechanic, and too often paralyze the arm of\r\nlaborious poverty. Within ten years, and in one of the most enlightened\r\ncantons, men and women have been arrested, and fined, and imprisoned, in\r\nthe most cruel manner, for assembling to read the word of God; have even\r\nbeen banished under pain of death, and without any passport to secure\r\nthem from imprisonment as vagrants in the neighbouring countries, merely\r\nfor preaching and hearing the gospel, out of the established church.\r\n\r\nIn the protestant churches of German Switzerland, the Helvetic\r\nconfession and the Heidelberg catechism, both in the strictest sense\r\northodox, are recognized as standards of faith. This, however, is the\r\n_only_ bond of union between the different portions of the Helvetic\r\nchurch. The spiritual concerns of each canton are under the direction of\r\nwhat is called the \"church council,\" established by the government, and\r\ncomposed of some of its members united with some of the clergy. This\r\nbody license, locate and pay the clergy; and form the court of appeal in\r\nthe affairs of the church. A congregation have no voice in the selection\r\nof their pastor. Baptism and confirmation, or admission to the Lord's\r\nsupper, in the established church, are required by law, as indispensable\r\nto the exercise of civil rights; and the latter ceremony is generally\r\nregarded as a mere introduction into life. In the canton of Berne, no\r\nperson can enter the most menial station as a domestic, without\r\nexhibiting his certificate of communion; and so far is this from being\r\nan obsolete law, that we have known a person incur its penalty, because\r\nhe delayed for a few days the exhibition of this certificate to the\r\npolice. In this canton, (and we believe in most others,) no person can\r\nbe excluded from the communion, except by government; and, as a\r\nnecessary consequence, no discipline exists in the church. The Lord's\r\nsupper is received with great regularity by the whole parish; and in\r\nsome districts at least, the opinion prevails, that this ordinance is a\r\nseal of the pardon of their sins.\r\n\r\nSuch is the external state of the church in German Switzerland. In\r\nregard to its spiritual condition, we have little encouraging to\r\npresent. The mercenary troops which Switzerland has so long been\r\naccustomed to sell to France, Spain and Italy, have usually brought back\r\ncorrupt principles and licentious habits; and the young men of patrician\r\nfamilies, from whom the rulers are ultimately chosen, have been\r\nprepared, by serving as officers to these troops, to exert a baneful\r\ninfluence upon their country. Those who were destined to the ministry,\r\nor to the learned professions, were accustomed to seek an education, if\r\npossible, in the German universities, where they would imbibe a taste\r\nfor any thing but evangelical principles. Rousseau, Voltaire, and\r\nGibbon, during their residence in Switzerland, contributed not a little\r\nto the increase of infidelity; and the French revolution seemed to sweep\r\naway the landmarks of religion and morality, and to banish whatever\r\nmight have remained, of the character of Switzerland, from the portions\r\nto which its emissaries had immediate access.\r\n\r\nIt will not be supposed that the church escaped untainted, amidst all\r\nthese causes of corruption. The feeling which we found extensively\r\nprevalent, that it was indecorous to inquire into the opinions of the\r\nclergy and the doctrines actually maintained in the church, and which\r\npresented a serious obstacle to investigation on this subject,\r\nsufficiently indicates, that there is something which will not bear a\r\ncomparison with the public standard. But more unequivocal evidence of\r\nthe change of opinion is found in the fact, that candidates for the\r\nministry are now only required to avow their belief in the new\r\ntestament, and these regulations are avowedly adopted, in order not to\r\nexclude those who are called \"liberal\" or \"rational\" in their opinions.\r\n\r\nWe trust indeed, that there are many thousands in Switzerland, who have\r\nnot bowed the knee to Baal, in any form. We believe especially, that in\r\nthe cantons of Basle, Zurich, Appenzell, and Schaffhausen, as well as\r\nGeneva and Vaud, there are many faithful ministers of the gospel. We\r\nknow that in the midst of decayed churches, there are little bands, who,\r\nwithout separating themselves, or exciting public attention, have\r\nadopted the principles and the devotional habits of the United Brethren,\r\nor Moravians. The missionary seminary at Basle is a radiating point,\r\nfrom which divine truth is going forth to the ends of the earth; and\r\nthere is a cluster of christian institutions around it, which are a\r\nmonument of love and zeal. Light is springing up in various directions\r\nin the midst of darkness and these first gleamings of the dawn are a\r\nsure and delightful presage, that the Sun of righteousness is about to\r\narise upon Switzerland, with healing in its beams.\r\n\r\nFor several years past, two or three of the clergy of the established\r\nchurch in the city of Berne, have preached the doctrines of the gospel,\r\nas exhibited in the standards of the church, with simplicity and\r\nfaithfulness. Much interest was thus excited in a small number of\r\npersons, several of whom were among the class of patricians, and the\r\nresult might be termed a little revival. Public attention was called to\r\nit, by the change of conduct in those who were its subjects. Their\r\nconsciences would no longer allow them to partake in those violations of\r\nthe Sabbath, and those questionable amusements which were customary in\r\nthe world around them; and they felt the need of assembling themselves\r\nfor social devotion and christian intercourse, during the week. Those\r\nwho felt reproved by such conduct, spared neither censure nor ridicule.\r\nThe names of \"_priest_,\" \"_methodist_,\" \"_mummer_,\" etc., were\r\nunsparingly applied to them; and in one instance, the windows of a\r\nperson who was obnoxious on this account, were broken. It is but justice\r\nto the government to state, that immediate and vigorous measures were\r\ntaken to repress all violence; and no one was suffered to interrupt\r\nthem, so long as they continued in connexion with the established\r\nchurch. Much hostility was indeed expressed against these private\r\nassemblies; but so much patrician influence was exerted in their favour,\r\nthat the government did not venture to execute the threats, sometimes\r\nthrown out, of prohibiting them. Pietism continued to increase, from the\r\nincreased action produced by these social meetings; and the flame was\r\nundoubtedly nourished by the conversation and correspondence of pious\r\nBritish travellers, whose influence may now be traced in every part of\r\nthe continent, from Calais to Naples, and exhibits one of these\r\nremarkable traits in the divine government, by which the seed of the\r\nword is scattered over the world, often by the consent of those who wish\r\nto destroy it. The wealth of the English gives them access every where.\r\nEven the court of Rome, rather than lose this source of revenue, allows\r\nheresy to rear its standard of rebellion on the banks of the Tiber; and\r\nthe efforts of such as are piously disposed to spread light around them,\r\nare winked at, to avoid offending or alarming the _national_ spirit,\r\neven of those who are devoted to the pleasures of the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1828, a small number of the persons who were thus\r\nawakened, felt it their duty to separate themselves entirely from the\r\nestablished church. Their consciences were wounded by the prostitution\r\nof the ordinance of the supper, in admitting all who chose to come;\r\nsince many of the openly vicious, and a multitude who had no apparent\r\ninterest in religion, belonged to the number. They urged the necessity\r\nof discipline from Matt. xvi. and xviii., 1 Cor. v., etc., and\r\nmaintained that that could not be deemed a church of Christ, which\r\ntolerated vice in its very bosom. They felt themselves bound by the\r\nprecept, 2 Thess. iii. 6, 14, 15, and 2 John 10, 11, to withdraw from a\r\nchurch in which the gospel was not generally preached; and which\r\ncherished in its bosom, so many who crucified Christ afresh, and whom\r\nthey considered themselves as recognizing as brethren, by partaking of\r\nthe same bread and the same cup. This measure was promoted by a person\r\nwho had been banished from the canton de Vaud; and who was received at\r\nBerne, under a pledge to the police, that he would not speak of\r\nseparation. The violation of this pledge led to his expulsion, which was\r\nthe first act of the government on this subject. This excited no serious\r\nopposition, since those who agreed with him in sentiment, did not\r\napprove of his violation of truth. It did not however prevent the\r\ncontinuance of the assemblies of separatists, and their distinct avowal\r\nof their sentiments; and they obtained from a member of the government\r\nbelonging to the established church, the use of a room to his own house,\r\non condition that nothing should be said there in direct promotion of\r\nseparatism.\r\n\r\nThis decided course of conduct, notwithstanding many hints and threats,\r\nplaced the government in an embarrassing situation. Eight years before,\r\nthe canton of Vaud had treated a similar sect (of which indeed, some of\r\nthese very individuals had been members) with great severity; but with\r\nso little effect, that their number had been constantly increasing, and\r\ntheir spirit had been diffused through a large number of the established\r\nchurches; to the great annoyance of those who did not love the gospel.\r\nThus warned of the danger of violent measures, and yet anxious to find\r\nreasons for expelling the leaders of the obnoxious party, they directed\r\nthe superintendent of the police to keep them and their assemblies under\r\nconstant and rigid inspection; and all who were concerned with them,\r\nwere watched with the same view. At the same time, one of the\r\nevangelical clergymen was sent for, and warned to alter his mode of\r\npreaching; and although he did not approve or preach separation, he was\r\naccused of contributing to the excitement of feeling, which gave rise to\r\nit, by his mode of exhibiting the doctrines of the bible. We need\r\nscarcely add, that the warning was without effect on this faithful\r\nminister of Christ.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1813, a few pious individuals began to meet in private, for\r\nthe purpose of seeking and cherishing that holy truth which was banished\r\nfrom the public assemblies. These persons were directed by some students\r\nof theology, among whom was M. Empaytaz. The venerable company of\r\npastors soon heard of these unauthorized proceedings, and lost no time\r\nin evincing their disapprobation respecting them. M. Empaytaz, was\r\nespecially marked out as the object of their displeasure; and they\r\nrefused to ordain him, unless he would avoid every religious assembly\r\nwhich had not their sanction. He chose rather to incur their anathema\r\nthan to wound his conscience, and departed from the city.\r\n\r\nBut the light had broke forth, and it was not easy again to extinguish\r\nit. The honourable company seem to have been extremely troubled as to\r\nthe course to be pursued. To sit still, however, was to yield to the\r\nrising spirit of reformation, and they determined to bestir themselves.\r\nAccordingly, after due deliberation, they issued certain regulations,\r\nbearing date May 3, 1817, which they hoped would be received as\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nThese articles however, did not produce the anticipated effect. The\r\ndoctrine of the divinity of Christ, and others equally offensive to\r\nUnitarians, continued to be preached. In 1818, M. Malan, a pious\r\northodox divine, was deprived of his place of regent of the college; and\r\nanother, M. Mejanel, was ordered to quit Geneva.\r\n\r\nFor some time, however, the individuals who retained their allegiance to\r\nthe Helvetic Confession, and remained at Geneva, still held their\r\nmeetings, with little other provocation than that of a few hard names,\r\nsuch as \"enthusiasts,\" \"Nazarenes,\" \"advocates for exploded doctrines,\"\r\n&c., which the Unitarians, in the exuberance of their wit, and the\r\noverflowing of their liberality, had the gratification to bespatter\r\nthem. These attacks produced very little impression upon the persons\r\nassailed. The arguments next adopted, were calculated to supply the\r\ndefect. About the beginning of July, 1818, the place of meeting being\r\nchanged, when the persons assembled, they found a large mob prepared to\r\ninsult them. These enlightened and worthy abettors of the reformed\r\nchurch of Geneva, and citizens of that free republic, assembled at the\r\nhouse of meeting, and vociferated amidst other expressions of\r\nhostility--we transcribe the words with shame and horror,--_A bas Jesus\r\nChrist! A bas les Moraves! A mort, a la lanterne_, &c. and pursued the\r\nobnoxious ministers as they came out, with similar cries. Neither did\r\nthey stop here: their valour and zeal, as is the case with all mobs,\r\nbecame more impetuous as they were not resisted. \"Our silence,\" says one\r\nwho was present, \"in the midst of these insults, did not satisfy them:\r\nwe had to suffer menaces, maledictions; stoning through the streets, and\r\nthe violation of our houses.\" Had not the police exerted themselves to\r\nsuppress these disorders, the consequences would probably have been\r\nstill more fearful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Persecution in the Pays de Vaud._\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1823, a letter was addressed by three young\r\nmen, ministers of that canton, and subsequently signed by a few others,\r\nto the council of state, intimating a determination to withdraw from the\r\nestablished church, and requesting permission to constitute places of\r\nworship independent of it. The cause assigned was, that the Helvetic\r\nConfession had been virtually set aside, both by pastors and people; and\r\nthat the discipline of the church was annihilated. Their plan was to\r\npreach according to that Confession, and to restore the discipline.\r\n\r\nThe petition to the council of state is dated Dec. 24, 1823. The\r\nofficial answer bears date Jan. 15, 1824; and has all the formalities\r\nwith which the spirit of intolerance and persecution generally invests\r\nitself, and is signed, Le Landamman en Charge, F. Clavel, Le Chandelier,\r\nBoisot. In this instrument, the ministers and their friends are called\r\n\"Momiers;\" and it is summarily decreed, that those who separate\r\nthemselves from the national church shall not be tolerated; that the\r\njustices of the peace, &c. are specially charged instantly to dissolve\r\ntheir meetings, and to report their proceedings to the council of state,\r\nand every person who attends these prohibited assemblies, and who has\r\ndisobeyed the orders to leave them, and rendered it necessary to employ\r\nforce, shall be imprisoned three days, besides the possible infliction\r\nof other pains and penalties; and that all persons whose measures shall\r\nhave tended to gain proselytes, shall be fined 600 livres, or imprisoned\r\ntwo years; the same punishment to be awarded to him who furnishes a\r\nplace of meeting, or who has called or directed a prohibited assembly,\r\nor who has taken any part whatever in quality of a chief or director.\r\nThe above decree was accompanied by a circular, dated Jan. 16, 1824,\r\nemanating from the same high quarter, addressed to the justices of the\r\npeace, municipalities, &c. and conceived in the same spirit with its\r\n_respectable_ associate.\r\n\r\nThis iniquitous and anti-christian enactment has been carried into\r\neffect in several instances. M. Charles Rochat, minister of the gospel,\r\nof the Canton de Vaud, of a respectable family, and whose brother is one\r\nof the national clergy, of the Canton, is the first on whom the severity\r\nof the law has fallen. Five persons were found seated round a table in\r\nhis own house, with the bible open before them: the wife of M. Rochat, a\r\ncommon friend, with two of his sisters, and a young person, a stranger.\r\nThis was the whole crime. M. Rochat was found guilty of reading in his\r\nown house, before his wife and four friends, a chapter of the New\r\nTestament! For this he was at first condemned to three year's\r\nbanishment, which, however, the tribunal of appeal reduced to one year.\r\n\r\nNext, M. Olivier was banished for two years, by the sentence of the same\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nLike judgments have been pronounced against M. M. Chavannes, Juvet, and\r\nFivas, of whom, the two former, were previously confined _ten weeks in\r\nprison_.\r\n\r\nTwo females also were banished by the judgment de premiere instant, of\r\nthe tribunal of Orbe and Yverden, on the charge of similar meetings\r\nbeing held at their houses; one of whom, however, has been since\r\nacquitted at Lausanne, as it was proved that she lived with her mother,\r\nand consequently that it was at her house, and not at hers, that some\r\nfriends, after dinner, read the bible together.\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely in the Canton de Vaud that these enormous instances\r\nof injustice have occurred: at Neufchatel, an act of arbitrary power has\r\njust been committed, almost incredible from its severity. An old law,\r\nlong obsolete, has been discovered, which, it seems, was passed two or\r\nthree hundred years back. An agriculturer has been made the first victim\r\nof its revived powers. He received into his house M. Juvet, one of the\r\ncondemned ministers of the Canton de Vaud, and allowed him to administer\r\nthe sacrament. For this crime he was thrown into prison for three\r\nmonths, and was then brought up in chains, and with a rope drawn tight\r\nround his neck, to receive sentence. Ten years banishment was the\r\npunishment pronounced; and that if he shall attempt to return before the\r\nexpiration of this term, he is to be marked with a hot iron for the\r\nfirst offence, and for the second to be _hanged_. No passport was given\r\nhim, so that he was left to be hunted about from place to place, like\r\nthe most degraded criminal. This worthy man, whose name was Maguin, has\r\na wife and three children, for whom he has now no means of procuring a\r\nsupport. [Wilson's Tour, 2d ed. page 325.]\r\n\r\nThese atrocities were practised by those who claim to be the only\r\nenlightened and liberal characters of our day--by Unitarians and\r\nSocinians--by men too, whose complaints respecting bigotry and\r\nintolerance, have been the burden of many a long article, expressly\r\ndesigned to represent orthodoxy as peculiarly relentless and cruel.\r\n\r\nA large number of Swiss pastors have been driven into banishment, by the\r\ninquisitorial proceedings of those who style themselves the _liberal_\r\nparty in Switzerland. Many of the exiles are now residing in different\r\nparts of France, mostly near the frontiers of their own country--others\r\nhave found a home in different parts of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nOne of them is now in that place where the wicked cease from\r\ntroubling--and another seems rapidly advancing to it. M. Juvet, who\r\nsigned, with two other ministers, the letter to the \"Council of State,\"\r\nhaving been banished from his own canton, sought an asylum in another\r\ncanton: this was refused. He then retired to Ferney Voltaire, and\r\npursued his labors. He was at that time weak from a pulmonary\r\nconsumption; but he ventured on an excursion to L'Isle of Mantrichen, to\r\nvisit those who were disposed to hear the word of God. \"He was insulted,\r\nattacked and pursued by the populace, from town to town; and at Le Isle,\r\nwhere he arrived quite exhausted, and in profuse perspiration, he was\r\nthrown into a cold dungeon, with only a chair and some chopped straw, on\r\nwhich to pass the night. His friends were not permitted to give him\r\neither food, fire, or clothing, and in this state he was detained\r\nfifteen hours.\" For two months he was confined in the prison of Yverden,\r\nunder circumstances of severe illness and medical attendance was denied\r\nhim. After leaving the prison, he was presently arrested and expelled\r\nthe commune. Under such accumulated sufferings, nature at length gave\r\nway: he slept in the Lord; and among his last prayers were petitions for\r\nhis persecutors whether the magistrates or the mob.\r\n\r\nRecent information from Geneva, and the other cantons of Switzerland,\r\ninform us that the spirit of persecution is still exhibited by the\r\n_liberal_ party in that country. Those who adhere to the Helvetic\r\nConfession, and preach conformably to the doctrines of the creed of the\r\nestablished church, are called \"Momiers,\" \"enthusiasts,\" and other terms\r\nequally, unkind and unchristian. The _liberal_, or infidel party, do not\r\nconfine themselves simply to reproaches. They disturb the places of\r\npublic worship--they stone the people as they return from their\r\ndevotions--they arraign them before civil tribunals for preaching Christ\r\nand him crucified--they impose fines upon them, subject them to\r\nimprisonment, banishment, and even death itself. All this is done too,\r\nin the 19th century, and by those who claim to be the only enlightened\r\nand liberal party on the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF THE LIVES OF SOME OF THE MOST EMINENT REFORMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will not be inappropriate to devote a few pages of this work to a\r\nbrief detail of the lives of some of those men who first stepped\r\nforward, regardless of the bigoted power which opposed all reformation,\r\nto stem the tide of papal corruption, and to seal the pure doctrines of\r\nthe gospel with their blood. Among these, Great Britain has the honor of\r\ntaking the lead, and first maintaining that freedom in religious\r\ncontroversy which astonished Europe, and demonstrated that political and\r\nreligious liberty are equally the growth of that favored island. Among\r\nthe earliest of these eminent persons was\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Wickliffe._\r\n\r\nThis celebrated reformer, denominated the Morning Star of the\r\nReformation, was born about the year 1324, in the reign of Edward II. Of\r\nhis extraction we have no certain account. His parents designing him for\r\nthe church, sent him to Queen's College, Oxford, about that period\r\nfounded by Robert Eaglesfield, confessor to queen Philippi. But not\r\nmeeting with the advantages for study in that newly established house\r\nwhich he expected, he removed to Merton College, which was then esteemed\r\none of the most learned societies in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which drew him into public notice, was his defence of\r\nthe University against the begging friars, who about this time, from\r\ntheir settlement in Oxford in 1230, had been troublesome neighbours to\r\nthe University. Feuds were continually fomented; the friars appealing to\r\nthe pope, the scholars to the civil power; and sometimes one party, and\r\nsometimes the other, prevailed. The friars became very fond of a notion\r\nthat Christ was a common beggar; that his disciples were beggars also;\r\nand that begging was of gospel institution. This doctrine they urged\r\nfrom the pulpit and wherever they had access.\r\n\r\nWickliffe had long held these religious friars in contempt for the\r\nlaziness of their lives, and had now a fair opportunity of exposing\r\nthem. He published a treatise against able beggary, in which he lashed\r\nthe friars, and proved that they were not only a reproach to religion,\r\nbut also to human society. The University began to consider him one of\r\nher first champions, and he was soon promoted to the mastership of\r\nBaliol College.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, archbishop Islip founded Canterbury Hall, in Oxford,\r\nwhere he established a warden and eleven scholars. To this wardenship\r\nWickliffe was elected by the archbishop, but upon his demise, he was\r\ndisplaced by his successor, Stephen Langham, bishop of Ely. As there\r\nwas a degree of flagrant injustice in the affair, Wickliffe appealed to\r\nthe pope, who subsequently gave it against him from the following cause:\r\nEdward the Third, then king of England, had withdrawn the tribute, which\r\nfrom the time of king John had been paid to the pope. The pope menaced;\r\nEdward called a parliament. The parliament resolved that king John had\r\ndone an illegal thing, and given up the rights of the nation, and\r\nadvised the king not to submit, whatever consequences might follow.\r\n\r\nThe clergy now began to write in favour of the pope, and a learned monk\r\npublished a spirited and plausible treatise, which had many advocates.\r\nWickliffe, irritated at seeing so bad a cause so well defended, opposed\r\nthe monk, and did it in so masterly a way, that he was considered no\r\nlonger as unanswerable. His suit at Rome was immediately determined\r\nagainst him; and nobody doubted but his opposition to the pope, at so\r\ncritical a period, was the true cause of his being non-suited at Rome.\r\n\r\nWickliffe was afterward elected to the chair of the divinity professor:\r\nand now fully convinced of the errors of the Romish church, and the\r\nvileness of its monastic agents, he determined to expose them. In public\r\nlectures he lashed their vices and opposed their follies. He unfolded a\r\nvariety of abuses covered by the darkness of superstition. At first he\r\nbegan to loosen the prejudices of the vulgar, and proceeded by slow\r\nadvances; with the metaphysical disquisitions of the age, he mingled\r\nopinions in divinity apparently novel. The usurpations of the court of\r\nRome was a favourite topic. On these he expatiated with all the keenness\r\nof argument, joined to logical reasoning. This soon procured him the\r\nclamour of the clergy, who, with the archbishop of Canterbury, deprived\r\nhim of his office.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the administration of affairs was in the hands of the duke\r\nof Lancaster, well known by the name of John of Gaunt. This prince had\r\nvery free notions of religion, and was at enmity with the clergy. The\r\nexactions of the court of Rome having become very burdensome, he\r\ndetermined to send the bishop of Bangor and Wickliffe to remonstrate\r\nagainst these abuses, and it was agreed that the pope should no longer\r\ndispose of any benifices belonging to the church of England. In this\r\nembassy, Wickliffe's observant mind penetrated into the constitution and\r\npolicy of Rome, and he returned more strongly than ever determined to\r\nexpose its avarice and ambition.\r\n\r\nHaving recovered his former situation, he inveighed, in his lectures,\r\nagainst the pope--his usurpation--his infallibility--his pride--his\r\navarice--and his tyranny. He was the first who termed the pope\r\nAntichrist. From the pope, he would turn to the pomp, the luxury and\r\ntrappings of the bishops, and compared them with the simplicity of\r\nprimitive bishops. Their superstitions and deceptions were topics that\r\nhe urged with energy of mind and logical precision.\r\n\r\nFrom the patronage of the duke of Lancaster, Wickliffe received a good\r\nbenefice; but he was no sooner settled in his parish, than his enemies\r\nand the bishops began to persecute him with renewed vigor. The duke of\r\nLancaster was his friend in this persecution, and by his presence and\r\nthat of Lord Percy, earl marshal of England, he so overawed the trial,\r\nthat the whole ended in disorder.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Edward III. his grandson Richard II. succeeded, in\r\nthe eleventh year of his age. The duke of Lancaster not obtaining to be\r\nthe sole regent, as he expected, his power began to decline, and the\r\nenemies of Wickliffe, taking advantage of this circumstance, renewed\r\ntheir articles of accusation against him. Five bulls were despatched in\r\nconsequence by the pope to the king and certain bishops, but the regency\r\nand the people manifested a spirit of contempt at the haughty\r\nproceedings of the pontiff, and the former at that time wanting money to\r\noppose an expected invasion of the French, proposed to apply a large\r\nsum, collected for the use of the pope to that purpose. The question was\r\nsubmitted to the decision of Wickliffe. The bishops, however, supported\r\nby the papal authority, insisted upon bringing Wickliffe to trial, and\r\nhe was actually undergoing examination at Lambeth, when, from the\r\nriotous behaviour of the populace without, and awed by the command of\r\nsir Lewis Clifford, a gentleman of the court, that they should not\r\nproceed to any definitive sentence, they terminated the whole affair in\r\na prohibition to Wickliffe, not to preach those doctrines which were\r\nobnoxious to the pope; but this was laughed at by our reformer, who,\r\ngoing about barefoot, and in a long frieze gown, preached more\r\nvehemently than before.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1378, a contest arose between two popes, Urban VI. and\r\nClement VII. which was the lawful pope, and true vicegerent of God. This\r\nwas a favourable period for the exertion of Wickliffe's talents: he soon\r\nproduced a tract against popery, which was eagerly read by all sorts of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of the year, Wickliffe was seized with a violent disorder,\r\nwhich it was feared might prove fatal. The begging friars, accompanied\r\nby four of the most eminent citizens of Oxford, gained admittance to his\r\nbed-chamber, and begged of him to retract, for his soul's sake, the\r\nunjust things he had asserted of their order. Wickliffe surprised at the\r\nsolemn message, raised himself in his bed, and with a stern countenance\r\nreplied, \"I shall not die, but live to declare the evil deeds of the\r\nfriars.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Wickliffe recovered, he set about a most important work, the\r\ntranslation of the bible into English. Before this work appeared, he\r\npublished a tract, wherein he showed the necessity of it. The zeal of\r\nthe bishops to suppress the scriptures, greatly promoted its sale, and\r\nthey who were not able to purchase copies, procured transcripts of\r\nparticular gospels or epistles. Afterward, when Lollardy increased, and\r\nthe flames kindled, it was a common practice to fasten about the neck of\r\nthe condemned heretic such of these scraps of scripture as were found in\r\nhis possession, which generally shared his fate.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this transaction, Wickliffe ventured a step further,\r\nand affected the doctrine of transubstantiation. This strange opinion\r\nwas invented by Paschade Radbert, and asserted with amazing boldness.\r\nWickliffe, in his lecture before the university of Oxford, 1381,\r\nattacked this doctrine, and published a treatise on the subject. Dr.\r\nBarton, at this time vice-chancellor of Oxford, calling together the\r\nheads of the university, condemned Wickliffe's doctrines as heretical,\r\nand threatened their author with excommunication. Wickliffe could now\r\nderive no support from the duke of Lancaster, and being cited to appear\r\nbefore his former adversary, William Courteney, now made archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, he sheltered himself under the plea, that, as a member of\r\nthe university, he was exempt from episcopal jurisdiction. This plea was\r\nadmitted, as the university were determined to support their member.\r\n\r\nThe court met at the appointed time, determined, at least to sit in\r\njudgment upon his opinions, and some they condemned as erroneous, others\r\nas heretical. The publication on this subject was immediately answered\r\nby Wickliffe, who had become a subject of the archbishop's determined\r\nmalice. The king, solicited by the archbishop, granted a license to\r\nimprison the teacher of heresy, but the commons made the king revoke\r\nthis act as illegal. The primate, however, obtained letters from the\r\nking, directing the head of the university of Oxford to search for all\r\nheresies and the books published by Wickliffe; in consequence of which\r\norder, the university became a scene of tumult. Wickliffe is supposed to\r\nhave retired from the storm, into an obscure part of the kingdom. The\r\nseeds, however, were scattered, and Wickliffe's opinions were so\r\nprevalent, that it was said, if you met two persons upon the road, you\r\nmight be sure that one was a Lollard. At this period, the disputes\r\nbetween the two popes continued. Urban published a bull, in which he\r\nearnestly called upon all who had any regard for religion, to exert\r\nthemselves in its cause; and to take up arms against Clement and his\r\nadherents in defence of the holy see.\r\n\r\nA war, in which the name of religion was so vilely prostituted, roused\r\nWickliffe's inclination, even in his declining years. He took up his pen\r\nonce more, and wrote against it with the greatest acrimony. He\r\nexpostulated with the pope in a very free manner, and asks him boldly,\r\n\"How he durst make the token of Christ on the cross (which is the token\r\nof peace, mercy and charity) a banner to lead us to slay christian men,\r\nfor the love of two false priests, and to oppress Christendom worse than\r\nChrist and his apostles were oppressed by the Jews? When, said he, will\r\nthe proud priest of Rome grant indulgences to mankind to live in peace\r\nand charity, as he now does to fight and slay one another?\"\r\n\r\nThis severe piece drew upon him the resentment of Urban; and was likely\r\nto have involved him in greater troubles than he had before experienced,\r\nbut providentially he was delivered out of their hands. He was struck\r\nwith the palsy, and though he lived some time yet in such a way, that\r\nhis enemies considered him as a person below their resentment. To the\r\nlast he attended divine worship, and received the fatal stroke of his\r\ndisorder in his church at Lutterworth, in the year 1384.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Martin Luther._\r\n\r\nThis illustrious German divine and reformer of the church, was the son\r\nof John Luther and Margaret Lindeman, and born at Isleben, a town of\r\nSaxony, in the county of Mansfield, November 10, 1483. His father's\r\nextraction and condition were originally but mean, and his occupation\r\nthat of a miner: it is probable, however, that by his application and\r\nindustry he improved the fortunes of his family, as he afterward became\r\na magistrate of rank and dignity. Luther was early initiated into\r\nletters, and at the age of thirteen was sent to school at Madgeburg, and\r\nthence to Eysenach, in Thuringia, where he remained four years,\r\nproducing the early indications of his future eminence.\r\n\r\nIn 1501 he was sent to the university of Erfurt, where he went through\r\nthe usual courses of logic and philosophy. When twenty, he took a\r\nmaster's degree, and then lectured on Aristotle's physics, ethics, and\r\nother parts of philosophy. Afterward, at the instigation of his parents,\r\nhe turned himself to the civil law, with a view of advancing himself to\r\nthe bar, but was diverted from this pursuit by the following accident.\r\nWalking out into the fields one day, he was struck by lightning so as to\r\nfall to the ground, while a companion was killed by his side; and this\r\naffected him so sensibly, that, without communicating his purpose to any\r\nof his friends, he withdrew himself from the world, and retired into the\r\norder of the hermits of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nHere he employed himself in reading St. Augustine and the school men;\r\nbut, in turning over the leaves of the library, he accidentally found a\r\ncopy of the Latin Bible, which he had never seen before. This raised his\r\ncuriosity to a high degree: he read it over very greedily, and was\r\namazed to find what a small portion of the scriptures was rehearsed to\r\nthe people. He made his profession in the monastery of Erfurt, after he\r\nhad been a novice one year; and he took priest's orders, and celebrated\r\nhis first mass in 1507. The year after, he was removed from the convent\r\nof Erfurt to the university of Wittemberg; for this university being\r\njust founded, nothing was thought more likely to bring it into immediate\r\nrepute and credit, than the authority and presence of a man so\r\ncelebrated, for his great parts and learning, as Luther. In 1512, seven\r\nconvents of his order having a quarrel with their vicar-general, Luther\r\nwas chosen to go to Rome to maintain their cause. At Rome he saw the\r\npope and the court, and had an opportunity of observing also the manners\r\nof the clergy, whose hasty, superficial, and impious way of celebrating\r\nmass, he has severely noted. As soon as he had adjusted the dispute\r\nwhich was the business of his journey, he returned to Wittemberg, and\r\nwas created doctor of divinity, at the expense of Frederic, elector of\r\nSaxony; who had often heard him preach, was perfectly acquainted with\r\nhis merit, and reverenced him highly. He continued in the university of\r\nWittemberg, where, as professor of divinity, he employed himself in the\r\nbusiness of his calling. Here then he began in the most earnest manner\r\nto read lectures upon the sacred books: he explained the epistle to the\r\nRomans, and the Psalms, which he cleared up and illustrated in a manner\r\nso entirely new, and so different from what had been pursued by former\r\ncommentators, that \"there seemed, after a long and dark night, a new day\r\nto arise, in the judgment of all pious and prudent men.\" The better to\r\nqualify himself for the task he had undertaken, he applied himself\r\nattentively to the Greek and Hebrew languages; and in this manner was he\r\nemployed, when the general indulgences were published in 1517. Leo X.\r\nwho succeeded Julius II. in March, 1513, formed a design of building the\r\nmagnificent church of St. Peter's at Rome, which was, indeed, begun by\r\nJulius, but still required very large sums to be finished. Leo,\r\ntherefore, 1517 published general indulgences throughout all Europe, in\r\nfavour of those who contribute any sum to the building of St. Peter's;\r\nand appointed persons in different countries to preach up these\r\nindulgences, and to receive money for them. These strange proceedings\r\ngave vast offence at Wittemberg, and particularly inflamed the pious\r\nzeal of Luther; who, being naturally warm and active, and in the present\r\ncase unable to contain himself, was determined to declare against them\r\nat all adventures. Upon the eve of All-saints, therefore, in 1517, he\r\npublicly fixed up, at the church next to the castle of that town, a\r\nthesis upon indulgences; in the beginning of which, he challenged any\r\none to oppose it either by writing or disputation. Luther's propositions\r\nabout indulgences, were no sooner published, than Tetzel, the Dominican\r\nfriar, and commissioner for selling them, maintained and published at\r\nFrancfort, a thesis, containing a set of propositions directly contrary\r\nto them. He did more; he stirred up the clergy of his order against\r\nLuther; anathematized him from the pulpit, as a most damnable heretic;\r\nand burnt his thesis publicly at Francfort. Tetzel's thesis was also\r\nburnt, in return, by the Lutherans at Wittemburg; but Luther himself\r\ndisowned having had any hand in that procedure. In 1518, Luther, though\r\ndissuaded from it by his friends, yet, to show obedience to authority,\r\nwent to the monastery of St. Augustine, at Heidelberg, while the chapter\r\nwas held; and here maintained, April 26, a dispute concerning\r\n\"justification by faith,\" which Bucer, who was present at, took down in\r\nwriting, and afterward communicated to Beatus Rhenanus, not without the\r\nhighest commendations. In the meantime, the zeal of his adversaries grew\r\nevery day more and more active against him; and he was at length accused\r\nto Leo X. as a heretic. As soon as he returned therefore from\r\nHeidelberg, he wrote a letter to that pope, in the most submissive\r\nterms; and sent him, at the same time, an explication of his\r\npropositions about indulgences. This letter is dated on Trinity-Sunday,\r\n1518, and was accompanied with a protestation, wherein he declared, that\r\n\"he did not pretend to advance or defend any thing contrary to the holy\r\nscriptures, or to the doctrine of the fathers, received and observed by\r\nthe church of Rome, or to the canons and decretals of the popes:\r\nnevertheless, he thought he had the liberty either to approve or\r\ndisapprove the opinions of St. Thomas, Bonaventure, and other school-men\r\nand canonists, which are not grounded upon any text.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor Maximilian was equally solicitous with the pope about\r\nputting a stop to the propagation of Luther's opinions in Saxony;\r\ntroublesome both to the church and empire. Maximilian, therefore,\r\napplied to Leo, in a letter dated August 5, 1518, and begged him to\r\nforbid, by his authority, these useless, rash, and dangerous disputes;\r\nassuring him also, that he would strictly execute in the empire whatever\r\nhis holiness should enjoin. In the meantime Luther, as soon an he\r\nunderstood what was transacting about him at Rome, used all imaginable\r\nmeans to prevent his being carried thither, and to obtain a hearing of\r\nhis cause in Germany. The elector was also against Luther's going to\r\nRome, and desired of cardinal Cajetan, that he might be heard before\r\nhim, as the pope's legate in Germany. Upon these addresses, the pope\r\nconsented that the cause should be tried before cardinal Cajetan, to\r\nwhom he had given power to decide it. Luther, therefore, set off\r\nimmediately for Augsburg, and carried with him letters from the elector.\r\nHe arrived here in October, 1518, and, upon an assurance of his safety,\r\nwas admitted into the cardinal's presence. But Luther was soon convinced\r\nthat he had more to fear from the cardinal's power, than from\r\ndisputations of any kind; and, therefore, apprehensive of being seized,\r\nif he did not submit, withdrew from Augsburg upon the 20th. But, before\r\nhis departure, he published a formal appeal to the pope, and finding\r\nhimself protected by the elector, continued to teach the same doctrines\r\nat Wittemberg, and sent a challenge to all the inquisitors to come and\r\ndispute with him.\r\n\r\nAs to Luther, Miltitius, the pope's chamberlain, had orders to require\r\nthe elector to oblige him to retract, or to deny him his protection; but\r\nthings were not now to be carried with so high a hand, Luther's credit\r\nbeing too firmly established. Besides, the emperor Maximilian happened\r\nto die upon the 12th of this month, whose death greatly altered the face\r\nof affairs, and made the elector more able to determine Luther's fate.\r\nMiltitius thought it best, therefore, to try what could be done by fair\r\nand gentle means, and to that end came to some conference with Luther.\r\nDuring all these treaties, the doctrine of Luther spread, and prevailed\r\ngreatly; and he himself received great encouragement at home and abroad.\r\nThe Bohemians about this time sent him a book of the celebrated John\r\nHuss, who had fallen a martyr in the work of reformation; and also\r\nletters, in which they exhorted him to constancy and perseverance,\r\nowning, that the divinity which he taught was the pure, sound, and\r\northodox divinity. Many great and learned men had joined themselves to\r\nhim. In 1519, he had a famous dispute at Leipsic with John Eccius. But\r\nthis dispute ended at length like all others, the parties not the least\r\nnearer in opinion, but more to enmity with each other's persons. About\r\nthe end of this year, Luther published a book, in which he contended for\r\nthe communion being celebrated in both kinds; which was condemned by the\r\nbishop of Misnia, January 24, 1520. While Luther was labouring to excuse\r\nhimself to the new emperor and the bishops of Germany, Eccius had gone\r\nto Rome, to solicit his condemnation; which, it may easily be conceived,\r\nwas now become not difficult to be attained. Indeed the continual\r\nimportunities of Luther's adversaries with Leo, caused him at length to\r\npublish a formal condemnation of him, and he did so accordingly, in a\r\nbull, dated June 15, 1520; this was carried into Germany, and published\r\nthere by Eccius, who had solicited it at Rome; and who, together with\r\nJerom Alexander, a person eminent for his learning and eloquence, was\r\nentrusted by the pope with the execution of it. In the meantime, Charles\r\nV. of Spain, after he had set things to rights in the Low Countries,\r\nwent into Germany, and was crowned emperor, October the 21st, at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle. The diet of Worms was held in the beginning of 1521;\r\nwhich ended at length in this single and peremptory declaration of\r\nLuther, that \"unless he was convinced by texts of scripture or evident\r\nreason (for he did not think himself obliged to submit to the pope or\r\nhis councils,) he neither could nor would retract any thing, because it\r\nwas not lawful for him to act against his conscience.\" Before the diet\r\nof Worms was dissolved, Charles V. caused an edict to be drawn up, which\r\nwas dated the 8th of May, and decreed that Martin Luther be, agreeably\r\nto the sentence of the pope, henceforward looked upon as a member\r\nseparated from the church, a schismatic, and an obstinate and notorious\r\nheretic. While the bull of Leo X. executed by Charles V. was thundering\r\nthroughout the empire, Luther was safely shut up in the castle of\r\nWittemberg; but weary at length of his retirement, he appeared publickly\r\nagain at Wittemberg, March 6, 1522, after he had been absent about ten\r\nmonths. Luther now made open war with the pope and bishops; and, that he\r\nmight make the people despise their authority as much as possible, he\r\nwrote one book against the pope's bull, and another against the order\r\nfalsely called \"the order of bishops.\" He published also, a translation\r\nof the \"New Testament\" in the German tongue, which was afterward\r\ncorrected by himself and Melancthon. Affairs were now in great confusion\r\nin Germany; and they were not less so in Italy, for a quarrel arose\r\nbetween the pope and the emperor, during which Rome was twice taken, and\r\nthe pope imprisoned. While the princes were thus employed in quarrelling\r\nwith each other, Luther persisted in carrying on the work of the\r\nreformation, as well by opposing the papists, as by combating the\r\nAnabaptists and other fanatical sects; which, having taken the advantage\r\nof his contest with the church of Rome, had sprung up and established\r\nthemselves in several places.\r\n\r\nIn 1527, Luther was suddenly seized with a coagulation of the blood\r\nabout the heart, which had like to have put an end to his life. The\r\ntroubles of Germany being not likely to have any end, the emperor was\r\nforced to call a diet at Spires, in 1529, to require the assistance of\r\nthe princes of the empire against the Turks. Fourteen cities, viz.\r\nStratsburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, Constance, Retlingen, Windsheim, Memmingen,\r\nLindow, Kempten, Hailbron, Isny, Weissemburg, Nortlingen, S. Gal, joined\r\nagainst the decree of the diet protestation, which was put into writing,\r\nand published the 19th of April, 1529. This was the famous protestation,\r\nwhich gave the name of Protestants to the reformers in Germany.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the protestant princes laboured to make a firm league and\r\nenjoined the elector of Saxony and his allies to approve of what the\r\ndiet had done; but the deputies drew up an appeal, and the protestants\r\nafterwards presented an apology for their \"Confession\"--that famous\r\nconfession which was drawn up by the temperate Melancthon, as also the\r\napology. These were signed by a variety of princes, and Luther had now\r\nnothing else to do, but to sit down and contemplate the mighty work he\r\nhad finished: for that a single monk should be able to give the church\r\nof Rome so rude a shock, that there needed but such another entirely to\r\noverthrow it, may be well esteemed a mighty work.\r\n\r\nIn 1533, Luther wrote a consolatory epistle to the citizens of Oschatz,\r\nwho had suffered some hardships for adhering to the Augsburg confession\r\nof faith: and in 1534, the Bible translated by him into German was first\r\nprinted, as the old privilege, dated at Bibliopolis, under the elector's\r\nown hand, shows; and it was published in the year after. He also\r\npublished this year a book \"against masses and the consecration of\r\npriests.\" In February, 1537, an assembly was held at Smalkald about\r\nmatters of religion, to which Luther and Melancthon were called. At this\r\nmeeting Luther was seized with so grievous an illness, that there was no\r\nhope of his recovery. As he was carried along he made his will, in which\r\nhe bequeathed his detestation of popery to his friends and brethren. In\r\nthis manner was he employed till his death, which happened in 1546. That\r\nyear, accompanied by Melancthon, he paid a visit to his own country,\r\nwhich he had not seen for many years, and returned again in safety. But\r\nsoon after, he was called thither again by the earls of Mansfelt, to\r\ncompose some differences which had arisen about their boundaries, where\r\nhe was received by 100 horsemen, or more, and conducted in a very\r\nhonourable manner; but was at the same time so very ill, that it was\r\nfeared he would die. He said, that these fits of sickness often came\r\nupon him, when he had any great business to undertake; of this, however,\r\nhe did not recover, but died February 18, in his 63d year. A little\r\nbefore he expired, he admonished those that were about him to pray to\r\nGod for the propagation of the gospel; \"because,\" said he, \"the council\r\nof Trent, which had sat once or twice, and the pope, will devise strange\r\nthings against it.\" Soon after, his body was put into a leaden coffin,\r\nand carried with funeral pomp to the church at Iselbein, when Dr. Jonas\r\npreached a sermon upon the occasion. The earls of Mansfelt desired that\r\nhis body should be interred in their territories; but the elector of\r\nSaxony insisted upon his being brought back to Wittemberg, which was\r\naccordingly done; and there he was buried with the greatest pomp that\r\nperhaps ever happened to any private man. Princes, earls, nobles, and\r\nstudents without number, attended the procession of this extraordinary\r\nreformer; and Melancthon made his funeral oration.\r\n\r\nWe will close this account of the great founder of the reformation, by\r\nsubjoining a few opinions, which have been passed upon him, by both\r\npapists and Protestants. \"Luther,\" says Father Simon, \"was the first\r\nProtestant who ventured to translate the Bible into the vulgar tongue\r\nfrom the Hebrew text, although he understood Hebrew but very\r\nindifferently. As he was of a free and bold spirit, he accuses St Jerom\r\nof ignorance in the Hebrew tongue; but he had more reason to accuse\r\nhimself of this fault, and for having so precipitately undertaken a work\r\nof this nature, which required more time than he employed about it.\r\nThere is nothing great or learned in his commentaries upon the Bible;\r\nevery thing low and mean: and though he had studied divinity, he has\r\nrather composed a rhapsody of theological questions, than a commentary\r\nupon the scripture text: to which we may add, that he wanted\r\nunderstanding, and usually followed his senses instead of his reason.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the language of those in the church of Rome who speak of Luther\r\nwith any degree of moderation; for the generality allow him neither\r\nparts, nor learning, nor any attainment intellectual or moral. But let\r\nus leave these impotent railers, and attend a little to more equitable\r\njudges. \"Luther,\" says Wharton, in his appendix to Cave's Historia\r\nLiteraria, \"was a man of prodigious sagacity and acuteness, very warm,\r\nand formed for great undertakings; being a man, if ever there was one,\r\nwhom nothing could daunt or intimidate. When the cause of religion was\r\nconcerned, he never regarded whose love he was likely to gain, or whose\r\ndispleasure to incur.\" He is also highly spoken of by Atterbury and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Calvin._\r\n\r\nThis reformer was born at Noyon in Picardy, July 10, 1409. He was\r\ninstructed in grammar learning at Paris under Maturinus Corderius, and\r\nstudied philosophy in the college of Montaign under a Spanish professor.\r\nHis father, who discovered many marks of his early piety, particularly\r\nin his reprehensions of the vices of his companions, designed him at\r\nfirst for the church, and got him presented, May 21, 1521, to the chapel\r\nof Notre Dame de la Gesine, in the church of Noyon. In 1527 he was\r\npresented to the rectory of Marieville, which he exchanged in 1529 for\r\nthe rectory of Pont l'Eveque, near Noyon. His father afterward changed\r\nhis resolution, and would have him study law; to which Calvin, who, by\r\nreading the scriptures, had conceived a dislike to the superstitions of\r\npopery, readily consented, and resigned the chapel of Gesine and the\r\nrectory of Pont l'Eveque, in 1534. He made a great progress in that\r\nscience, and improved no less in the knowledge of divinity by his\r\nprivate studies. At Bourges he applied to the Greek tongue, under the\r\ndirection of professor Wolmar. His father's death having called him back\r\nto Noyon, he stayed there a short time, and then went to Paris, where a\r\nspeech of Nicholas Cop, rector of the university of Paris, of which\r\nCalvin furnished the materials, having greatly displeased the Sarbonne\r\nand the parliament, gave rise to a persecution against the protestants,\r\nand Calvin, who narrowly escaped being taken in the college of Forteret,\r\nwas forced to retire to Xaintonge, after having had the honour to be\r\nintroduced to the queen of Navarre, who had raised this first storm\r\nagainst the protestants. Calvin returned to Paris in 1534. This year the\r\nreformed met with severe treatment, which determined him to leave\r\nFrance, after publishing a treatise against those who believe that\r\ndeparted souls are in a kind of sleep. He retired to Basil, where he\r\nstudied Hebrew: at this time he published his Institutions of the\r\nChristian religion; a work well adapted to spread his fame, though he\r\nhimself was desirous of living in obscurity. It is dedicated to the\r\nFrench king, Francis I. Calvin next wrote an apology for the protestants\r\nwho were burnt for their religion in France. After the publication of\r\nthis work, Calvin went to Italy to pay a visit to the duchess of\r\nFerrara, a lady of eminent piety, by whom he was very kindly received.\r\n\r\nFrom Italy he came back to France, and having settled his private\r\naffairs, he proposed to go to Strasbourg or Basil, in company with his\r\nsole surviving brother, Antony Calvin; but as the roads were not safe on\r\naccount of the war, except through the duke of Savoy's territories, he\r\nchose that road. \"This was a particular direction of Providence,\" says\r\nBayle; \"it was his destiny that he should settle at Geneva, and when he\r\nwas wholly intent upon going farther, he found himself detained by an\r\norder from heaven, if I may so speak.\" At Geneva, Calvin therefore was\r\nobliged to comply with the choice which the consistory and magistrates\r\nmade of him, with the consent of the people, to be one of their\r\nministers, and professor of divinity. He wanted to undertake only this\r\nlast office, and not the other; but in the end he was obliged to take\r\nboth upon him, in August, 1536. The year following, he made all the\r\npeople declare, upon oath, their assent to the confession of faith,\r\nwhich contained a renunciation of popery. He next intimated, that he\r\ncould not submit to a regulation which the canton of Berne had lately\r\nmade. Whereupon the syndics of Geneva, summoned an assembly of the\r\npeople; and it was ordered that Calvin, Farel, and another minister,\r\nshould leave the town in a few days, for refusing to administer the\r\nsacrament.\r\n\r\nCalvin retired to Strasbourg, and established a French church in that\r\ncity, of which he was the first minister: he was also appointed to be\r\nprofessor of divinity there. Meanwhile the people of Geneva entreated\r\nhim so earnestly to return to them, that at last he consented and\r\narrived September 13, 1541, to the great satisfaction both of the\r\npeople and the magistrates; and the first thing he did, after his\r\narrival, was to establish a form of church discipline, and a\r\nconsistorial jurisdiction, invested with power of inflicting censures\r\nand canonical punishments, as far as excommunication, inclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agency of Calvin in the death of Michael Servetus._\r\n\r\nIt has long been the delight of both infidels and some professed\r\nchristians, when they wish to bring odium upon the opinions of Calvin,\r\nto refer to his agency in the death of Michael Servetus. This action is\r\nused on all occasions by those who have been unable to overthrow his\r\nopinions, as a conclusive argument against his whole system. Calvin\r\nburnt Servetus!--Calvin burnt Servetus! is good proof with a certain\r\nclass of reasoners, that the doctrine of the Trinity is not true--that\r\ndivine sovereignty is anti-scriptural,--and christianity a cheat. We\r\nhave no wish to palliate any act of Calvin's which is manifestly wrong.\r\nAll his proceedings, in relation to the unhappy affair of Servetus, we\r\nthink, cannot be defended. Still it should be remembered that the true\r\nprinciples of religious toleration were very little understood in the\r\ntime of Calvin. All the other reformers then living, approved of\r\nCalvin's conduct. Even the gentle and amiable Melancthon expressed\r\nhimself in relation to this affair, in the following manner. In a letter\r\naddressed to Bullinger, he says, \"I have read your statement respecting\r\nthe blasphemy of Servetus, and praise your piety and judgment; and am\r\npersuaded that the Council of Geneva has done right in putting to death\r\nthis obstinate man, who would never have ceased his blasphemies. I am\r\nastonished, that any one can be found to disapprove of this proceeding.\"\r\nFarel expressly says, that \"Servetus deserved a capital punishment.\"\r\nBucer did not hesitate to declare, that \"Servetus deserved something\r\nworse than death.\" The truth is, although Calvin had some hand in the\r\narrest and imprisonment of Servetus, he was unwilling that he should be\r\nburnt at all. \"I desire,\" says he, \"that the severity of the punishment\r\nshould be remitted.\" \"We endeavoured to commute the kind of death, but\r\nin vain.\" \"By wishing to mitigate the severity of the punishment,\" says\r\nFarel to Calvin, \"you discharge the office of a friend towards your\r\ngreatest enemy.\" \"That Calvin was the instigator of the magistrates that\r\nServetus might be burned,\" says Turritine, \"historians neither any where\r\naffirm, nor does it appear from any considerations. Nay, it is certain,\r\nthat he, with the college of pastors, dissuaded from that kind of\r\npunishment.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been often asserted, that Calvin possessed so much influence with\r\nthe magistrates of Geneva, that he might have obtained the release of\r\nServetus, had he not been desirous of his destruction. This however, is\r\nnot true. So far from it, that Calvin was himself once banished from\r\nGeneva, by these very magistrates, and often opposed their arbitrary\r\nmeasures in vain. So little desirous was Calvin of procuring the death\r\nof Servetus, that he warned him of his danger and suffered him to\r\nremain several weeks at Geneva, before he was arrested. But his\r\nlanguage, which was then accounted blasphemous, was the cause of his\r\nimprisonment. When in prison, Calvin visited him, and used every\r\nargument to persuade him to retract his horrible blasphemies, without\r\nreference to his peculiar sentiments. This was the extent of Calvin's\r\nagency in this unhappy affair.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, however, be denied, that in this instance, Calvin acted\r\ncontrary to the benignant spirit of the gospel. It is better to drop a\r\ntear over the inconsistency of human nature, and to bewail those\r\ninfirmities which cannot be justified. He declares he acted\r\nconscientiously, and publicly justified the act. Cranmer acted the same\r\npart towards the poor Anabaptists in the reign of Edward VI. This\r\ndoctrine they had learned at Rome, and it is certain, that, with a very\r\nfew exceptions, it was at this time the opinion of all parties. The\r\nauthor of the Memoirs of Literature says, \"If the religion of\r\nprotestants depended on the doctrine and conduct of the reformers, he\r\nshould take care how he published his account of Servetus; but as the\r\nprotestant religion is entirely founded on Holy Scripture, so the\r\ndefaults of the reformers ought not to have any ill influence on the\r\nreformation. The doctrine of non-toleration, which obtained to the\r\nsixteenth century, among some protestants, was that pernicious error\r\nwhich they had imbibed in the Church of Rome; and I believe, I can say,\r\nwithout doing any injury to that church, that she is, in a great\r\nmeasure, answerable for the execution of Servetus. If the Roman\r\ncatholics had never put any person to death for the sake of religion, I\r\ndare say that Servetus had never been condemned to die in any protestant\r\ncity. Let us remember, that Calvin, and all the magistrates of Geneva,\r\nin the year 1553, were born and bred up in the church of Rome: this is\r\nthe best apology that can be made for them.\"--_Biographia Evangelica_,\r\nvol. II. p. 42.\r\n\r\nThe apostles John and James would have called down fire from heaven;\r\nCalvin and Cranmer kindled it on earth. This, however, is the only fault\r\nalleged against Calvin; but \"Let him that is without sin cast the first\r\nstone.\"\r\n\r\n\"It ought, however,\" says a sensible writer, \"to be acknowledged that\r\npersecution for religious principles was not at that time peculiar to\r\nany party of christians, but common to all, whenever they were invested\r\nwith civil power.\" It was a detestable error; but it was the error of\r\nthe age. They looked upon heresy in the same light as we look upon those\r\ncrimes which are inimical to the peace of civil society; and,\r\naccordingly, proceeded to punish heretics by the sword of the civil\r\nmagistrate. If Socinians did not persecute their adversaries so much as\r\nTrinitarians, it was because they were not equally invested with the\r\npower of doing so. Mr. Lindsay acknowledges, that Faustus Socinus\r\nhimself was not free from persecution in the case of Francis David,\r\nsuperintendent of the Unitarian churches in Transylvania. David had\r\ndisputed with Socinus on the invocation of Christ, and died in prison in\r\nconsequence of his opinion, and some offence taken at his supposed\r\nindiscreet propagation of it from the pulpit. \"I wish I could say,\" adds\r\nMr. Lindsay, \"that Socinus, or his friend Blandrata, had done all in\r\ntheir power to prevent his commitment, or procure his release\r\nafterwards.\" The difference between Socinus and David was very slight.\r\nThey both held Christ to be a mere man. The former, however, was for\r\npraying to him; which the latter, with much greater consistency,\r\ndisapproved. Considering this, the persecution to which Socinus was\r\naccessary was as great as that of Calvin; and there is no reason to\r\nthink, but that if David had differed as much from Socinus, as Servetus\r\ndid from Calvin, and if the civil magistrates had been for burning him,\r\nSocinus would have concurred with them. To this it might be added, that\r\nthe conduct of Socinus was marked with disingenuity: in that he\r\nconsidered the opinion of David in no very heinous point of light; but\r\nwas afraid of increasing the odium under which he and his party already\r\nlay, among other Christian churches.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion, that _erroneous religious principles are punishable\r\nby the civil magistrate_, that did the mischief, whether at Geneva, in\r\nTransylvania, or in Britain; and to this, rather than to Trinitarianism,\r\nor Unitarianism, it ought to be imputed.\r\n\r\nThe inflexible rigour with which Calvin asserted, on all occasions, the\r\nrights of his consistory, procured him many enemies: but nothing daunted\r\nhim; and one would hardly believe, if there were not unquestionable\r\nproofs of it, that, amidst all the commotions at home, he could take so\r\nmuch care as he did of the churches abroad, in France, Germany, England,\r\nand Poland, and write so many books and letters. He did more by his pen\r\nthan his presence; nevertheless on some occasions, he acted in person,\r\nparticularly at Frankfort, in 1556, whither he went to put an end to the\r\ndisputes which divided the French church in that city. He was always\r\nemployed, having almost constantly his pen in his hand, even when\r\nsickness confined him to his bed; and he continued the discharge of all\r\nthose duties, which his zeal for the general good of the churches\r\nimposed on him, till the day of his death, May 27, 1564. He was a man\r\nwhom God had endowed with very eminent talents; a clear understanding, a\r\nsolid judgment, and a happy memory: he was a judicious, elegant, and\r\nindefatigable writer, and possessed of very extensive learning and a\r\ngreat zeal for truth. Joseph Scaliger, who was not lavish of his praise,\r\ncould not forbear admiring Calvin; none of the commentators, he said,\r\nhad so well hit the sense of the prophets; and he particularly commended\r\nhim for not attempting to give a comment on the Revelation. We\r\nunderstand from Guy Patin, that many of the Roman catholics would do\r\njustice to Calvin's merit, if they dared to speak their minds. It must\r\nexcite a laugh at those who have been so stupid as to accuse him of\r\nbeing a lover of wine, good cheer, company, money, &c. Artful slanderers\r\nwould have owned that he was sober by constitution, and that he was not\r\nsolicitous to heap up riches.\r\n\r\nThat a men who had acquired so great a reputation and such an authority,\r\nshould yet have had but a salary of 100 crowns, and refuse to accept\r\nmore; and after living 55 years with the utmost frugality, should leave\r\nbut 300 crowns to his heirs, including the value of his library, which\r\nsold very dear, is something so heroical, that one must have lost all\r\nfeeling not to admire. When Calvin took his leave of Strasbourg, to\r\nreturn to Geneva, they wanted to continue to him the privileges of a\r\nfreeman of their town, and the revenues of a prebend, which had been\r\nassigned to him; the former he accepted, but absolutely refused the\r\nother. He carried one of the brothers with him to Geneva, but he never\r\ntook any pains to get him preferred to an honourable post, as any other\r\npossessed of his credit would have done. He took care indeed of the\r\nhonour of his brother's family, by getting him freed from an adultress,\r\nand obtaining leave for him to marry again; but even his enemies relate\r\nthat he made him learn the trade of a bookbinder, which he followed all\r\nhis life after.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calvin as a friend of civil liberty._\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Wisner, in his late discourse at Plymouth, on the\r\nanniversary of the landing of the pilgrims, makes the following\r\nassertion:--\"Much as the name of Calvin has been scoffed at and loaded\r\nwith reproach by many sons of freedom, there is not an historical\r\nproposition more susceptible of complete demonstration than this, that\r\n_no man has lived to whom the world is under greater obligations for the\r\nfreedom it now enjoys, than John Calvin_.\" In a note appended to the\r\nsermon, Dr. Wisner gives the following testimonies, from history, of the\r\ntruth of this proposition--testimonies which deserve the more attention,\r\nas they come from Calvin's opposers. We copy the note from the Boston\r\nRecorder.\r\n\r\n\"It may not be unacceptable to the reader, to add a few particulars in\r\nconfirmation of the statement in reference to the influence of Calvin in\r\nforming the opinions and character of the Puritans, and thus\r\ncontributing to the discovery and establishment of the principles of\r\nreligious and civil liberty.\r\n\r\n\"The peculiarities of the religious doctrines of the Puritans had an\r\nimportant influence in producing in them determined and persevering\r\nresistance to arbitrary power, and a successful vindication of their\r\nreligious and political rights. The fact is sufficiently illustrated in\r\nthe quotation in the sermon from the Edinburg Review. It is admitted by\r\nHume, and by all, whatever their religious opinions, who have thoroughly\r\ninvestigated the springs of action in those discoverers, and founders of\r\nreligious and civil freedom. But the doctrinal views of the Puritans\r\nwere derived from Calvin.\r\n\r\n\"Their disapprobation of the rites and ceremonies enjoined by the\r\nEnglish government was a prominent means of leading them to the\r\ndiscovery, and stimulating to the successful vindication of the\r\nprinciples of religious and civil liberty. And that disapprobation may\r\nbe directly traced to the influence of Calvin. With him many of the\r\nleading Puritan divines studied theology, and were taught the importance\r\nof laying aside the whole mass of popish additions to the simplicity of\r\napostolic worship. When the difficulties arose among the exiles at\r\nFrankfort, in Mary's reign, about the use of King Edward's Liturgy, they\r\nasked advice of Calvin, \"who having perused the English Liturgy, took\r\nnotice, 'that there were many tolerable weaknesses in it, which, because\r\nat first they could not be amended, were to be suffered; but that it\r\nbehooved the learned, grave, and godly ministers of Christ to enterprise\r\nfarther, and to set up something more filed from rust, and purer.' 'If\r\nreligion,' says he 'had flourished till this day in England, many of\r\nthese things would have been corrected. But since the reformation is\r\noverthrown and a church is to be set up in another place where you are\r\nat liberty to establish what order is most for edification, I cannot\r\ntell what they mean, who are so fond of the leavings of popish dregs.'\"\r\nWhen the conformist party had triumphed at Frankfort, they \"wrote to Mr.\r\nCalvin to countenance their proceedings; which that great divine could\r\nnot do; but after a modest excuse for intermeddling in their affairs,\r\ntold them, that, 'in his opinion, they were too much addicted to the\r\nEnglish ceremonies; nor could he see to what purpose it was to burden\r\nthe church with such hurtful and offensive things, when there was\r\nliberty to have simple and more pure order.'\" The puritan part of the\r\nexiles retired to Geneva, and there prepared and published a service\r\nbook, in the dedication of which they say, that \"they had set up such an\r\norder as, in the judgment of Mr. Calvin and other learned divines, was\r\nmost agreeable to scripture, and the best reformed churches. And when,\r\nsubsequently, the important step was taken, by several puritans in and\r\nabout London, of breaking off from the established churches and setting\r\nup a separate congregation, they adopted for use, (as they say in their\r\n'agreement' thus to separate) a book and order of preaching,\r\nadministration of sacraments and discipline, that the great Mr. Calvin\r\nhad approved of, and which was free from the superstitions of the\r\nEnglish service.\"--_Neal, i. 152, 153, 154, 155, 252._\r\n\r\nBut most important of all, in its influence on religious and civil\r\nliberty, was the attachment of the puritans to a popular church\r\ngovernment. And of the origin of this system, we have the following\r\naccount from 'the judicious Hooker,' prefixed to his famous work on\r\nEcclesiastical Polity, written expressly against it. \"A founder it had,\r\nwhom, for mine own part, I think incomparably the wisest man that ever\r\nthe French (protestant) church, did enjoy, since the hour it enjoyed\r\nhim. His bringing up was in the civil law. Divine knowledge he gathered,\r\nnot by hearing or reading, so much as by teaching others. For thousands\r\nwere debtors to him, as touching knowledge in that kind, yet he to none,\r\nbut only to God, the author of that most blessed fountain the Book of\r\nLife, and of the admirable dexterity of wit, together with the helps of\r\nother learning, which were his guides. Two things of principal moment\r\nthere are, which have deservedly procured him honour throughout the\r\nworld; the one, his exceeding pains in composing the institutions of the\r\nchristian religion; this other, his no less industrious travels for the\r\nexposition of holy scripture, according to the same institutions. In\r\nwhich two things, whosoever they were that after him bestowed their\r\nlabour, he gained the advantage, of prejudice against them if they\r\ngainsayed, and of glory above them if they consented. Of what account\r\nthe Master of Sentences was in the church of Rome, the same, and more,\r\namong the preachers of the reformed churches, Calvin had purchased; so\r\nthat the perfectest divines were judged they who were skilfulest in\r\nCalvin's writings; his books being almost the very canon to judge both\r\ndoctrine and discipline by.\"\r\n\r\n\"These statements are confirmed by abundant testimony from writers of\r\nauthority who had no good opinion of Calvin or his principles. Says\r\nHume, (History of England, iii. 57,) \"These disputes [about ceremonies,\r\n&c.] which had been started during the reign of Edward, were carried\r\nabroad by the protestants who fled from the persecutions of Mary; and as\r\nthe zeal of these men had received an increase from the pious zeal of\r\ntheir enemies, they were generally inclined to carry their opposition to\r\nthe utmost extremity against the practices of the church of Rome. Their\r\ncommunication with Calvin, and the other reformers who followed the\r\ndiscipline and worship of Geneva, confirmed them in this obstinate\r\nreluctance; and though some of the refugees, particularly those who were\r\nestablished at Frankfort, still adhered to king Edward's Liturgy, the\r\nprevailing spirit carried these confessors to seek a still further\r\nreformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The celebrated Dean Swift, in a sermon preached on what tories and high\r\nchurchmen in England, have styled, \"the martyrdom of king Charles I.\"\r\nmakes the following statements:--Upon the cruel persecution raised\r\nagainst the protestants under queen Mary, among great numbers who fled\r\nthe kingdom to seek for shelter, several went and resided at Geneva,\r\nwhich is a commonwealth, governed without a king, where the religion\r\ncontrived by Calvin is without the order of bishops. When the protestant\r\nfaith was restored by queen Elizabeth, those who fled to Geneva\r\nreturned, among the rest, home to England, and were grown so fond of the\r\ngovernment and religion of the place they had left, that they used all\r\npossible endeavours to introduce both into their own country; at the\r\nsame time continually preaching and railing against ceremonies and\r\ndistinct habits of the clergy, taxing whatever they disliked as a\r\nremnant of popery; and continued exceedingly troublesome to the church\r\nand state, under that great queen, as well as her successor, king James\r\nI. These people called themselves puritans, as pretending to a purer\r\nfaith than those of the established church. And these were the founders\r\nof our dissenters. They did not think it sufficient to leave all the\r\nerrors of popery; but threw off many laudable and edifying institutions\r\nof the primitive church, and at last even the government of bishops,\r\nwhich, having been ordained by the apostles themselves, had continued\r\nwithout interruption, in all christian churches, for above fifteen\r\nhundred years. And all this they did, not because those things were\r\nevil, but because they were kept by the papists. From hence they\r\nproceeded, by degrees, to quarrel with the kingly government, because,\r\nas I have already said, the city of Geneva, to which their fathers had\r\nflown for refuge, was a commonwealth, or government of the people.\"\r\nHaving thus stated the foundation and principles of puritanism, the Dean\r\nproceeds with an account of its growth till the breaking out of the\r\ncivil war, and concludes the narrative as follows: \"That odious\r\nparliament had early turned the bishops out of the House of Lords, in a\r\nfew years after they murdered their king; then immediately abolished the\r\nwhole House of Lords; and so, at last obtained their wishes of having a\r\ngovernment of the people, and a new religion, both after the manner of\r\nGeneva, without a king, a bishop, or a nobleman; and this they\r\nblasphemously called, 'The kingdom of Christ and His Saints.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In the same way, Dryden traced the origin of republicanism in England,\r\nas appears from his political poem called the _Hind and the Panther_; in\r\nwhich he characterizes the Romish church under the name of the Hind, the\r\nEnglish church under that of the Panther, and the Presbyterian under\r\nthat of the Wolf. In the following extract, the 'kennel' means the city\r\nof Geneva; the 'puddle' its lake, and the 'wall' its rampart.\r\n\r\n        \"The last of all the litter scap'd by chance,\r\n        And from Geneva first invested France.\r\n        Some authors thus his pedigree will trace;\r\n        But others write him of an upstart race,\r\n        Because of Wickliffe's brood no mark he brings\r\n        _But his innate antipathy to kings._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        What though your native kennel still be small,\r\n        Bounded betwixt a puddle and a wall?\r\n        Yet your victorious colonies are sent,\r\n        Where the north ocean girds the continent.\r\n        Quicken'd with fire below, your monster's breed,\r\n        In fenny Holland, and in fruitful Tweed;\r\n        And like the first, the last effects to be\r\n        Drawn to the dregs of a _democracy_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        But as the poisons of the deadliest kind\r\n        Are to their own unhappy coasts confined,\r\n        So Presbyt'ry and pestilential zeal,\r\n        _Can only flourish in a_ COMMONWEAL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Life of the Rev. John Fox._\r\n\r\nJohn Fox, was born at Boston, in Lincolnshire, in 1517, where his\r\nparents are stated to have lived in respectable circumstances. He was\r\ndeprived of his father at an early age; and notwithstanding his mother\r\nsoon married again, he still remained under the parental roof. From an\r\nearly display of talents and inclination to learning, his friends were\r\ninduced to send him to Oxford, in order to cultivate and bring them to\r\nmaturity. During his residence at this place, he was distinguished for\r\nthe excellence and acuteness of his intellect, which was improved by the\r\nemulation of his fellow-collegians, united to an indefatigable zeal and\r\nindustry on his part. These qualities soon gained him the admiration of\r\nall; and as a reward for his exertions and amiable conduct, he was\r\nchosen fellow of Magdalen college; which was accounted a great honour in\r\nthe university, and seldom bestowed unless in cases of great\r\ndistinction. It appears that the first display of his genius was in\r\npoetry; and that he composed some Latin comedies, which are still\r\nextant. But he soon directed his thoughts to a more serious subject, the\r\nstudy of the sacred scriptures: to divinity, indeed, he applied himself\r\nwith more fervency than circumspection, and discovered his partiality to\r\nthe reformation, which had then commenced, before he was known to its\r\nsupporters, or to those who protected them; a circumstance which proved\r\nto him the source of his first troubles.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have often affirmed, that the first matter which\r\noccasioned his search into the popish doctrine, was, that he saw divers\r\nthings, most repugnant in their nature to one another, forced upon men\r\nat the same time; upon this foundation his resolution and intended\r\nobedience to that church were somewhat shaken, and by degrees a dislike\r\nto the rest took place.\r\n\r\nHis first care was to look into both the ancient and modern history of\r\nthe church; to ascertain its beginning and progress; to consider the\r\ncauses of all those controversies which in the meantime had sprung up,\r\nand diligently to weigh their effects, solidity, infirmities, &c.\r\n\r\nBefore he had attained his thirtieth year, he had studied the Greek and\r\nLatin fathers, and other learned authors, the transactions of the\r\ncouncils, and decrees of the consistories, and had acquired a very\r\ncompetent skill in the Hebrew language. In these occupations, he\r\nfrequently spent a considerable part, or even the whole of the night,\r\nand in order to unbend his mind after such incessant study, he would\r\nresort to a grove near the college, a place much frequented by the\r\nstudents in the evening, on account of its sequestered gloominess. In\r\nthese solitary walks, he has been heard to ejaculate heavy sobs and\r\nsighs, and with tears to pour forth his prayers to God. These nightly\r\nretirements, in the sequel, gave rise to the first suspicion of his\r\nalienation from the church of Rome. Being pressed for an explanation of\r\nthis alteration in his conduct, he scorned to call in fiction to his\r\nexcuse; he stated his opinions; and was, by the sentence of the college\r\n_convicted, condemned as a heretic, and expelled_.\r\n\r\nHis friends, upon the report of this circumstance, were highly offended,\r\nand especially his father-in-law, who was now grown altogether\r\nimplacable, either through a real hatred conceived against him for this\r\ncause, or pretending himself aggrieved, that he might now, with more\r\nshow of justice, or at least with more security, withhold from Mr. Fox\r\nhis paternal estate; for he knew it could not be safe for one publicly\r\nhated, and in danger of the law, to seek a remedy for his injustice.\r\n\r\nWhen he was thus forsaken by his own friends, a refuge offered itself in\r\nthe house of Sir Thomas Lucy, of Warwickshire, by whom he was sent for\r\nto instruct his children. In this house he afterwards married. But the\r\nfear of the popish inquisitors hastened his departure thence; as they\r\nwere not contented to pursue public offences, but began also to dive\r\ninto the secrets of private families. He now began to consider what was\r\nbest to be done to free himself from further inconvenience, and resolved\r\neither to go to his wife's father or to his father in-law.\r\n\r\nHis wife's father was a citizen of Coventry, whose heart was not\r\nalienated from him, and he was more likely to be well entreated, for his\r\ndaughter's sake. He resolved first to go to him; and, in the meanwhile,\r\nby letters, to try whether his father-in-law would receive him or not.\r\nThis he accordingly did, and he received for answer, \"that it seemed to\r\nhim a hard condition to take one into his house whom he knew to be\r\nguilty and condemned for a capital offence; neither was he ignorant what\r\nhazard he should undergo in so doing; he would, however, show himself a\r\nkinsman, and neglect his own danger.\" If he would alter his mind, he\r\nmight come, on condition to stay as long as he himself desired; but if\r\nhe could not be persuaded to that, he must content himself with a\r\nshorter stay, and not bring him and his mother into danger.\r\n\r\nNo condition was to be refused; besides, he was secretly advised by his\r\nmother to come, and not to fear his father-in-law's severity; \"for that,\r\nperchance, it was needful to write as he did, but when occasion should\r\nbe offered, he would make recompense for his words with his actions.\" In\r\nfact he was better received by both of them than he had hoped for.\r\n\r\nBy these means he kept himself concealed for some time, and afterwards\r\nmade a journey to London, in the latter part of the reign of Henry,\r\nVIII. Here, being unknown, he was in much distress, and was even reduced\r\nto the danger of being starved to death, had not Providence interfered\r\nin his favour in the following manner:\r\n\r\nOne day as Mr. Fox was sitting in St. Paul's church, exhausted with long\r\nfasting, a stranger took a seat by his side, and courteously saluted\r\nhim, thrust a sum of money into his hand, and bade him cheer up his\r\nspirits; at the same time informing him, that in a few days new\r\nprospects would present themselves for his future subsistence. Who this\r\nstranger was, he could never learn, but at the end of three days he\r\nreceived an invitation from the dutchess of Richmond to undertake the\r\ntuition of the children of the earl of Surry who, together with his\r\nfather, the duke of Norfolk, was imprisoned in the Tower, by the\r\njealousy and ingratitude of the king. The children thus confided to his\r\ncare were, Thomas, who succeeded to the dukedom; Henry, afterwards earl\r\nof Northampton; and Jane who became countess to Westmoreland. In the\r\nperformance of his duties, he fully satisfied the expectations of the\r\ndutchess, their aunt.\r\n\r\nThese halcyon days continued during the latter part of the reign of\r\nHenry VIII. and the five years of the reign of Edward VI. till Mary came\r\nto the crown, who, soon after her accession, gave all power into the\r\nhands of the papists.\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. Fox, who was still under the protection of his noble\r\npupil, the duke, began to excite the envy and hatred of many,\r\nparticularly Dr. Gardiner, then bishop of Winchester, who in the sequel\r\nbecame his most violent enemy.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox, aware of this, and seeing the dreadful persecutions then\r\ncommencing, began to think of quitting the kingdom. As soon as the duke\r\nknew his intention, he endeavoured to persuade him to remain; and his\r\narguments were so powerful, and given with so much sincerity, that he\r\ngave up the thought of abandoning his asylum for the present.\r\n\r\nAt that time the bishop of Winchester was very intimate with the duke\r\n(by the patronage of whose family he had risen to the dignity he then\r\nenjoyed,) and frequently waited on him to present his service when he\r\nseveral times requested that he might see his old tutor. At first the\r\nduke denied his request, at one time alleging his absence, at another,\r\nindisposition. At length it happened that Mr. Fox, not knowing the\r\nbishop was in the house, entered the room where the duke and he were in\r\ndiscourse; and seeing the bishop, withdrew. Gardiner asked who that was;\r\nthe duke answered, \"his physician, who was somewhat uncourtly, as being\r\nnew come from the university.\" \"I like his countenance and aspect very\r\nwell,\" replied the bishop \"and when occasion offers, I will send for\r\nhim.\" The duke understood that speech as the messenger of some\r\napproaching danger; and now himself thought it high time for Mr. Fox to\r\nquit the city, and even the country. He accordingly caused every thing\r\nnecessary for his flight to be provided in silence, by sending one of\r\nhis servants to Ipswich to hire a bark, and prepare all the requisites\r\nfor his departure. He also fixed on the house of one of his servants,\r\nwho was a farmer, where he might lodge till the wind became favourable;\r\nand every thing being in readiness, Mr. Fox took leave of his noble\r\npatron, and with his wife, who was pregnant at the time, secretly\r\ndeparted for the ship.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was scarcely under sail, when a most violent storm came on,\r\nwhich lasted all day and night, and the next day drove them back to the\r\nport from which they had departed. During the time that the vessel had\r\nbeen at sea, an officer, despatched by the bishop of Winchester, had\r\nbroken open the house of the farmer with a warrant to apprehend Mr. Fox\r\nwherever he might be found, and bring him back to the city. On hearing\r\nthis news he hired a horse, under the pretence of leaving the town\r\nimmediately; but secretly returned the same night, and agreed with the\r\ncaptain of the vessel to sail for any place as soon as the wind should\r\nshift, only desiring him to proceed, and not to doubt that God would\r\nprosper his undertaking. The mariner suffered himself to be persuaded,\r\nand within two days landed his passengers in safety at Nieuport.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a few days in that place, Mr. Fox set out for Basle,\r\nwhere he found a number of English refugees, who had quitted their\r\ncountry to avoid the cruelty of the persecutors, with these he\r\nassociated, and began to write his \"History of the Acts and Monuments of\r\nthe Church,\" which was first published in Latin at Basle, and shortly\r\nafter in English.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the reformed religion began again to flourish in\r\nEngland, and the popish faction much to decline, by the death of Queen\r\nMary; which induced the greater number of the protestant exiles to\r\nreturn to their native country.\r\n\r\nAmong others, on the accession of Elizabeth to the throne, Mr. Fox\r\nreturned to England; where, on his arrival, he found a faithful and\r\nactive friend in his late pupil, the duke of Norfolk, till death\r\ndeprived him of his benefactor: after which event, Mr. Fox inherited a\r\npension bequeathed to him by the duke, and ratified by his son, the earl\r\nof Suffolk.\r\n\r\nNor did the good man's successes stop here. On being recommended to the\r\nqueen by her secretary of state, the great Cecil, her majesty granted\r\nhim the prebendary of Shipton, in the cathedral of Salisbury, which was\r\nin a manner forced upon him; for it was with difficulty that he could be\r\npersuaded to accept it.\r\n\r\nOn his resettlement in England, he employed himself in revising and\r\nenlarging his admirable Martyrology. With prodigious pains and constant\r\nstudy he completed that celebrated work in eleven years. For the sake of\r\ngreater correctness, he wrote every line of this vast book with his own\r\nhand, and transcribed all the records and papers himself. But, in\r\nconsequence of such excessive toil, leaving no part of his time free\r\nfrom study, nor affording himself either the repose or recreation which\r\nnature required, his health was so reduced, and his person became so\r\nemaciated and altered, that such of his friends and relations as only\r\nconversed with him occasionally, could scarcely recognise his person.\r\nYet, though he grew daily more exhausted, he proceeded in his studies as\r\nbriskly as ever, nor would he be persuaded to diminish his accustomed\r\nlabours. The papists, forseeing how detrimental his history of their\r\nerrors and cruelties would prove to their cause, had recourse to every\r\nartifice to lessen the reputation of his work; but their malice was of\r\nsignal service, both to Mr. Fox himself, and to the church of God at\r\nlarge, as it eventually made his book more intrinsically valuable, by\r\ninducing him to weigh, with the most scrupulous attention, the certainty\r\nof the facts which he recorded, and the validity of the authorities from\r\nwhich he drew his information.\r\n\r\nBut while he was thus indefatigably employed in promoting the cause of\r\ntruth, he did not neglect the other duties of his station; he was\r\ncharitable, humane, and attentive to the wants, both spiritual and\r\ntemporal, of his neighbours. With the view of being more extensively\r\nuseful, although he had no desire to cultivate the acquaintance of the\r\nrich and great on his own account, he did not decline the friendship of\r\nthose in a higher rank who proffered it, and never failed to employ his\r\ninfluence with them in behalf of the poor and needy. In consequence of\r\nhis well known probity and charity, he was frequently presented with\r\nsums of money by persons possessed of wealth, which he accepted and\r\ndistributed among those who were distressed. He would also occasionally\r\nattend the table of his friends, not so much for the sake of pleasure,\r\nas from civility, and to convince them that his absence was not\r\noccasioned by a fear of being exposed to the temptations of the\r\nappetite. In short, his character as a man and as a christian, was\r\nwithout reproach.\r\n\r\nOf the esteem in which he was held, the names of the following\r\nrespectable friends and noble patrons, will afford ample proof. It has\r\nbeen already mentioned that the attachment of the duke of Norfolk was so\r\ngreat to his tutor, that he granted him a pension for life; he also\r\nenjoyed the patronage of the earls of Bedford and Warwick, and the\r\nintimate friendship of Sir Francis Walsingham, (secretary of state,) Sir\r\nThomas, and Mr. Michael Hennage, of whom he was frequently heard to\r\nobserve, that Sir Thomas had every requisite for a complete courtier,\r\nbut that Mr. Michael possessed all the merits of his brother, besides\r\nhis own, still untainted by the court. He was on very intimate and\r\naffectionate terms with Sir Drue Drury, Sir Francis Drake, Dr. Grindal,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Elmar, bishop of London, Dr. Pilkington,\r\nbishop of Durham, and Dr. Nowell, dean of St. Paul's. Others of his most\r\nintimate acquaintances and friends were, Doctors Umphrey, Whitaker, and\r\nFulk, Mr. John Crowly, and Mr. Baldwin Collins. Among the eminent\r\ncitizens, we find he was much venerated by Sir Thomas Gresham, Sir\r\nThomas Roe, Alderman Bacchus, Mr. Smith, Mr. Dale, Mr. Sherrington, &c.\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\nAt length, having long served both the church and the world by his\r\nministry, by his pen, and by the unsullied lustre of a benevolent\r\nuseful, and holy life, he meekly resigned his soul to Christ, on the\r\n18th of April, 1587, being then in the seventieth year of his age. He\r\nwas interred in the chancel of St Giles', Cripplegate; of which parish\r\nhe had been, in the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, for some time\r\nvicar.\r\n\r\nThe Lord had given him a foresight of his departure; and so fully was he\r\nassured that the time was just at hand when his soul should quit the\r\nbody, that (probably to enjoy unmolested communion with God, and to have\r\nno worldly interruptions in his last hours) he purposely sent his two\r\nsons from home, though he loved them with great tenderness; and before\r\nthey returned, his spirit, as he had foreseen would be the case, had\r\nflown to heaven.\r\n\r\nHis death occasioned great lamentations throughout the city, and his\r\nfuneral was honoured with a great concourse of people, each of whom\r\nappeared to bewail the loss of a father or a brother.\r\n\r\nIn his able martyrology he has elaborately treated of the vices and\r\nabsurdities of papal hierarchy, of which the following is a brief\r\nenumeration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Errors, Rites, Ceremonies, and Superstitious Practices, of the Romish\r\nChurch._\r\n\r\nTRADITIONS.] The church of Rome having deprived the laity of the Bible,\r\nsubstitutes in its stead apostolic and ecclesiastical traditions; and\r\nobliges her disciples to admit for truth whatever she teaches them: but\r\nwhat do the holy scriptures say? \"Why do ye transgress the commandment\r\nof God by your tradition?\" Matt. xv. 3, 9, &c. They also command us \"to\r\ncall no man master (in spiritual concerns;) to try the spirit, and\r\nbeware of false teachers.\"\r\n\r\nPRAYERS AND DIVINE SERVICES IN LATIN.] The Roman Catholics will not\r\ninterpret the scriptures otherwise than according to the sense of holy\r\nmother church, and the pretended unanimous consent of the fathers: they\r\nassert also, that the scriptures ought not to be read publicly, nor\r\nindifferently by all; and, that the common people may be enslaved by\r\ngross ignorance, they perform public worship in an unknown tongue,\r\ncontrary to the rule laid down by the apostle, \"That all things should\r\nbe done to edification.\" St. Paul says, \"If I pray in an unknown tongue,\r\nmy spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.\"\r\n\r\nSEVEN SACRAMENTS.] Two only were instituted by Christ, to which the\r\nRomish church has added five more, making in all seven, necessary to\r\nsalvation, namely, the eucharist, baptism, confirmation, penance,\r\nextreme unction, orders, and matrimony. To those two which Christ\r\ninstituted, she has added a mixture of her own inventions; for in the\r\nsacrament of baptism, she uses, salt, oil, or spittle; and in the\r\nsacrament of the Lord's supper, the laity have only the bread\r\nadministered to them; and even that not after the manner ordained by\r\nChrist, who broke the bread and gave it to his disciples; instead of\r\nwhich the church of Rome administers to her members not bread, but a\r\nwafer, and the priests only drink the wine, though our blessed Lord\r\nsaid, \"Drink ye ALL of this.\" Matt. xxvi. 27.\r\n\r\nTHE MASS.] Roman catholics believe it to be a true, proper, and\r\npropitiatory sacrifice, and therefore call it the sacrament of the\r\naltar; whereas, the death of Christ was a full and complete sacrifice,\r\n\"in which he hath, by one suffering, perfected for ever them that are\r\nsanctified. He himself is a priest for ever; who, being raised from the\r\ndead, died no more; and who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself\r\nwithout spot to God.\" Paul's Epist. to the Hebrews, ch. ix. 10. It was\r\non account of this gross absurdity, and the irreligious application of\r\nit, that our first reformers suffered, and so many were put to death in\r\nthe reign of queen Mary.\r\n\r\nTRANSUBSTANTIATION.] Roman catholics profess, that in the most holy\r\nsacrament of the Lord's supper, there is really and substantially the\r\nbody and blood, together with the soul and divinity, of Christ, and that\r\nthe whole substance of the bread is turned into his body, and the whole\r\nsubstance of the wine into his blood; which conversion, so contradictory\r\nto our senses, they call transubstantiation, but at the same time they\r\naffirm, that, under either kind or species, only one whole entire\r\nChrist, and the true sacrament, is received. But why are those words,\r\n\"This is my body,\" to be taken in a literal sense, any more than those\r\nconcerning the cup? Our Saviour says, \"I am the true vine, I am the\r\ndoor.\" St. Paul says, \"Our fathers drank of the rock that followed them,\r\nand that rock was Christ;\" and writing to the Corinthians, he affirms,\r\nthat, \"he had fed them with milk.\" Can these passages be taken\r\nliterally? Why then must we be forced to interpret our Saviour's words\r\nin a literal sense, when the apostle has explained the intention of the\r\nsacrament to be \"to show forth the Lord's death till he come!\"\r\n\r\nPURGATORY.] This, they say, is a certain place, in which, as in a\r\nprison, after death, those souls, by the prayers of the faithful, are\r\npurged, which in this life could not be fully cleansed; no not by the\r\nblood of Christ: and notwithstanding it is asserted in the scriptures,\r\n\"if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us, and to\r\ncleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" 1 John i. 9. This place of\r\npurgatory is in the power of the pope, who dispenses the indulgences,\r\nand directs the treasury of his merits, by which the pains are\r\nmitigated, and the deliverance hastened. For the tormented sufferers, in\r\nthis ideal inquisition, his monks and friars say masses, all of whom\r\nmust be paid for their trouble; because, no penny, no pater-noster; by\r\nwhich bubble the church of Rome amasses great wealth.\r\n\r\nIDOLATRY AND CREATURE-WORSHIP.] In all the Romish worship the blessed\r\nvirgin is a principal object of adoration. She is styled the queen of\r\nHeaven, lady of the world, the only hope of sinners, queen of angels,\r\npatroness of men, advocate for sinners, mother of mercies, under which\r\ntitles they desire her, by the power of a mother, to command her Son. In\r\nsome prayers, they invoke God to bring them to heaven by the merits and\r\nmediation of the Virgin Mary and all her saints, and that they may enjoy\r\nperpetual soundness both of body and mind by her glorious intercession.\r\nHence it might be imagined by a papist, that the sacred writings were\r\nfull of encomiums on this pretended mother of God; whereas, on the\r\ncontrary, we do not find Christ in any part of scripture called the Son\r\nof Mary, nor that he at any time calls her mother; and when the woman\r\ncried, \"Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the paps that thou hast\r\nsucked.\" \"Yea, (returns our Lord) rather blessed are they that hear the\r\nword of God, and keep it.\" Nor does our Saviour own any relation but\r\nthat of a disciple; for when his mother and brethren stood without,\r\ndesiring to speak with him, Jesus answered, \"Who are my mother and\r\nbrethren?\" And looking round upon his disciples, he saith, \"Behold my\r\nmother and my brethren; for whosoever shalt do the will of my Father who\r\nis in heaven, the same is my brother, sister, and mother.\" Of the same\r\nnature are their prayers to other saints and angels, by which they\r\nderogate from the honour of our Christ, and transfer his offices to\r\nothers; though the scriptures expressly assert, there is but one\r\nmediator between God and man. Nor must we omit under this head the\r\nidolatry of the mass, in the elevation of the host. Thus is the second\r\ncommandment infringed, which the Romish church has endeavoured as much\r\nas possible to suppress, and in many of their little manuals it is\r\naltogether omitted.\r\n\r\nPAPAL SOVEREIGNTY.] This is politically supported by a pretended\r\ninfallibility; auricular confession, founded upon the priest's power to\r\nforgive sins; indulgences; pretended relics; penance; strings of beads\r\nfor Ave-Marys and pater-nosters; celibacy; merits and works of\r\nsupererogations; restrictions; monkish austerities; religious vows and\r\norders; palms; candles; decorated images; holy water; christening of\r\nbells; hallowed flowers and branches; agnus dei; oblations;\r\nconsecrations, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nLUDICROUS FORMS AND CEREMONIES.] At the feast of Christmas, the Roman\r\ncatholics have exhibited in their churches a cradle, with an image of an\r\ninfant in it, which is rocked with great seeming devotion; and on\r\nGood-Friday they have the figure of our Saviour on the cross, and then\r\nthey perform the service which they call the Tenebres; having abundance\r\nof lighted candles, all of which they extinguish one by one, after which\r\nthe body is taken down from the cross and put into a sepulchre, and men\r\nstand to watch it.\r\n\r\nCRUEL MAXIMS.] Papists hold that heretics may not be termed children and\r\nkindred; that no faith is to be kept with heretics; and that it is\r\nlawful to torture or kill them for the good of their souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1789, AS CONNECTED WITH THE HISTORY\r\nOF PERSECUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design of those who were the primary agents in originating the\r\ncauses of the French Revolution, was the utter subversion of the\r\nchristian religion. Voltaire, the leader in this crusade against\r\nreligion, boasted that \"with one hand he would pull down, what took\r\ntwelve Apostles to build up.\" The motto on the seal of his letters was,\r\n\"Crush the wretch,\" having reference to Jesus Christ, and the system of\r\nreligion, which he promulgated. To effect his object he wrote and\r\npublished a great variety of infidel tracts, containing the most\r\nlicentious sentiments and the most blasphemous attacks upon the religion\r\nof the Bible. Innumerable copies of these tracts were printed, and\r\ngratuitously circulated in France and other countries. As they were\r\nadapted to the capacity of all classes of persons, they were eagerly\r\nsought after, and read with avidity. The doctrines inculcated in them\r\nwere subversive of every principle of morality and religion. The\r\neverlasting distinctions between virtue and vice, were completely broken\r\ndown. Marriage was ridiculed--obedience to parents treated as the most\r\nabject slavery--subordination to civil government, the most odious\r\ndespotism--and the acknowledgement of a God, the height of folly and\r\nabsurdity. Deeply tinged with such sentiments, the revolution of 1789,\r\nfound the popular mind in France prepared for all the atrocities which\r\nfollowed. The public conscience had become so perverted, that scenes of\r\ntreachery, cruelty and blood were regarded with indifference, and\r\nsometimes excited the most unbounded applause in the spectators. Such a\r\nchange had been effected in the French character, by the propagation of\r\nInfidel and Atheistical opinions, \"that from being one of the most light\r\nhearted and kind tempered of nations,\" says Scott, \"the French seemed\r\nupon the revolution to have been animated, not merely with the courage,\r\nbut with the rabid fury of wild beasts.\" When the Bastile was stormed\r\n\"Fouton and Berthier, two individuals whom they considered as enemies of\r\nthe people, were put to death, with circumstances of cruelty and insult\r\nfitting only at the death stake of an Indian encampment; and in\r\nimitation of literal cannibals, there were men, or rather monsters\r\nfound, not only to tear asunder, the limbs of their victims, but to eat\r\ntheir hearts, and drink their blood.\"\r\n\r\nCroly, in his new interpretation of the Apocalypse, holds the following\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe primary cause of the French revolution was the exile of\r\nProtestantism.\r\n\r\nIts decency of manners had largely restrained the licentious tendencies\r\nof the higher orders; its learning had compelled the Romish\r\nEcclesiastics to similar labours; and while christianity could appeal to\r\nsuch a church in France, the progress of the infidel writers was checked\r\nby the living evidence of the purity, peacefulness and wisdom of the\r\nGospel. It is not even without sanction of scripture and history to\r\nconceive that, the presence of such a body of the servants of God was a\r\ndivine protection to their country.\r\n\r\nBut the fall of the church was followed by the most palpable, immediate,\r\nand ominous change. The great names of the Romish priesthood, the\r\nvigorous literature of Bossnett, the majestic oratory of Massillon, the\r\npathetic and classic elegance of Fenelon, the mildest of all\r\nenthusiasts; a race of men who towered above the genius of their country\r\nand of their religion; passed away without a successor. In the beginning\r\nof the 18th century, the most profligate man in France was an\r\necclesiastic, the Cardinal Dubois, prime minister to the most profligate\r\nprince in Europe, the Regent Orleans. The country was convulsed with\r\nbitter personal disputes between Jesuit and Jansenist, fighting even to\r\nmutual persecution upon points either beyond or beneath the human\r\nintellect. A third party stood by, unseen, occasionally stimulating\r\neach, but equally despising both, a potential fiend, sneering at the\r\nblind zealotry and miserable rage that were doing its unsuspected will.\r\nRome, that boasts of her freedom from schism should blot the 18th\r\ncentury from her page.\r\n\r\nThe French mind, subtle, satirical, and delighting to turn even matters\r\nof seriousness into ridicule, was immeasurably captivated by the true\r\nburlesque of those disputes, the childish virulence, the extravagant\r\npretensions, and the still more extravagant impostures fabricated in\r\nsupport of the rival pre-eminence in absurdity; the visions of half-mad\r\nnuns and friars; the Convulsionaries; the miracles at the tomb of the\r\nAbbe Paris, trespasses on the common sense of man, scarcely conceivable\r\nby us if they had not been renewed under our eyes by popery. All France\r\nwas in a burst of laughter.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this tempest of scorn an extraordinary man arose, to\r\nguide and deepen it into public ruin, VOLTAIRE; a personal profligate;\r\npossessing a vast variety of that superficial knowledge which gives\r\nimportance to folly; frantic for popularity, which he solicited at all\r\nhazards; and sufficiently opulent to relieve him from the necessity of\r\nany labours but those of national undoing. Holding but an inferior and\r\nstruggling rank in all the manlier provinces of the mind, in science,\r\npoetry, and philosophy; he was the prince of scorners. The splenetic\r\npleasantry which stimulates the wearied tastes of high life; the\r\ngrossness which half concealed captivates the loose, without offence to\r\ntheir feeble decorum; and the easy brilliancy which throws what colours\r\nit will on the darker features of its purpose; made Voltaire, the very\r\ngenius of France. But under this smooth and sparkling surface,\r\nreflecting like ice all the lights flung upon it, there was a dark\r\nfathomless depth of malignity. He hated government; he hated morals; he\r\nhated man, he hated religion. He sometimes bursts out into exclamations\r\nof rage and insane fury against all that we honour as best and holiest,\r\nthat sound less the voice of human lips than the echoes of the final\r\nplace of agony and despair.\r\n\r\nA tribe worthy of his succession, showy, ambitious, and malignant,\r\nfollowed; each with some vivid literary contribution, some powerful and\r\npopular work, a new despotic of combustion in that mighty mine on which\r\nstood in thin and fatal security the throne of France. Rousseau, the\r\nmost impassioned of all romancers, the great corrupter of the female\r\nmind. Buffon, a lofty and splendid speculator, who dazzled the whole\r\nmultitude of the minor philosophers, and fixed the creed of\r\nMaterialism. Moutesquieu, eminent for knowledge and sagacity in his\r\n\"Spirit of Laws\" striking all the establishments of his country into\r\ncontempt; and in his \"Persian Letters,\" levelling the same blow at her\r\nmorals. D'Alembert, the first mathematician of his day, an eloquent\r\nwriter, the declared pupil of Voltaire, and, by his secretary-ship of\r\nthe French academy, furnished with all the facilities for propagating\r\nhis master's opinions. And Diderot, the projector and chief conductor of\r\nthe Encyclopedia, a work justly exciting the admiration of Europe, by\r\nthe novelty and magnificence of its design, and by the comprehensive and\r\nsolid extent of its knowledge; but in its principles utterly evil, a\r\ncondensation of all the treasons of the school of anarchy, the _lex\r\nscripta_ of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAll those men were open infidels; and their attacks on religion, such as\r\nthey saw it before them, roused the Gallican church. But the warfare was\r\ntotally unequal. The priesthood came armed with the antiquated and\r\nunwieldy weapons of old controversy, forgotten traditions and exhausted\r\nlegends. They could have conquered them only by the bible; they fought\r\nthem only with the breviary. The histories of the saints, and the\r\nwonders of images were but fresh food for the most overwhelming scorn.\r\nThe bible itself, which popery has always laboured to close, was brought\r\ninto the contest, and used resistlessly against the priesthood. They\r\nwere contemptuously asked, in what part of the sacred volume had they\r\nfound the worship of the Virgin, of the Saints, or of the Host? where\r\nwas the privilege that conferred Saintship at the hands of the pope?\r\nwhere was the prohibition of the general use of scripture by every man\r\nwho had a soul to be saved? where was the revelation of that purgatory,\r\nfrom which a monk and a mass could extract a sinner? where was the\r\ncommand to imprison, torture, and slay men for their difference of\r\nopinion with an Italian priest and the college of cardinals? To those\r\nformidable questions the clerics answered by fragments from the fathers,\r\nangry harangues, and more legends of more miracles. They tried to enlist\r\nthe nobles and the court in a crusade. But the nobles were already among\r\nthe most zealous, though secret, converts to the Encyclopedia; and the\r\ngentle spirit of the monarch was not to be urged into a civil war. The\r\nthreat of force only inflamed contempt into vengeance. The populace of\r\nParis, like all mobs, licentious, restless, and fickle; but beyond all,\r\ntaking an interest in public matters, had not been neglected by the deep\r\ndesigners who saw in the quarrel of the pen the growing quarrel of the\r\nsword. The Fronde was not yet out of their minds; the barrier days of\r\nParis; the municipal council which in 1648, had levied war against the\r\ngovernment; the mob-army which had fought, and terrified that government\r\ninto forgiveness; were the strong memorials on which the anarchists of\r\n1793 founded their seduction. The perpetual ridicule of the national\r\nbelief was kept alive among them. The populace of the provinces, whose\r\nreligion was in their rosary, were prepared for rebellion by similar\r\nmeans and the terrible and fated visitation of France began.\r\n\r\nAfter passing through many scenes from the recital of which the mind\r\nturns away with loathing and disgust, the reign of terror commenced.\r\nPrevious to this, however, there had been dreadful riots, and disorders\r\nin Paris. The Swiss Guards had been cut to pieces, and the king and\r\nroyal family imprisoned. The priests had nearly all perished or been\r\nbanished from France. The national assembly was divided into desperate\r\nfactions, which often turned their arms against one another. When one\r\nparty triumphed, proscription followed, and the guillotine was put in\r\nrequisition, and blood flowed in torrents. The grossest irreligion\r\nlikewise prevailed. Leaders of the atheistical mob would extend their\r\narms to heaven and dare a God, if he existed, to vindicate his insulted\r\nmajesty, and crush them with his thunderbolts. Over the entrance of\r\ntheir grave yards was placed this inscription, \"DEATH AN ETERNAL SLEEP.\"\r\nMen who dared to think differently from the dominant faction, were\r\nimmediately executed, in mockery, often, of all the forms of justice.\r\nThe most ferocious of the bloody factions, were the jacobins, so called\r\nfrom their place of meeting. The leaders of this party were Danton,\r\nRobespierre, and Marat. They are thus described by Scott in his life of\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\nThree men of terror, whose names will long remain, we trust, unmatched\r\nin history by those of any similar miscreants, had now the unrivalled\r\nleading of the jacobins, and were called the Triumvirate.\r\n\r\nDanton deserves to be named first, as unrivalled by his colleagues in\r\ntalent and audacity. He was a man of gigantic size, and possessed a\r\nvoice of thunder. His countenance was that of an Ogre on the shoulders\r\nof a Hercules. He was as fond of the pleasures of vice as of the\r\npractice of cruelty; and it was said there were times when he became\r\nhumanized amidst his debauchery, laughed at the terror which his furious\r\ndeclamation excited, and might be approached with safety like the\r\nMaelstrom at the turn of tide. His profusion was indulged to an extent\r\nhazardous to his popularity, for the populace are jealous of a lavish\r\nexpenditure, as raising their favourites too much above their own\r\ndegree; and the charge of peculation finds always ready credit with\r\nthem, when brought against public men.\r\n\r\nRobespierre possessed this advantage over Danton, that he did not seem\r\nto seek for wealth, either for hoarding or expending, but lived in\r\nstrict and economical retirement, to justify the name of the\r\nIncorruptible, with which he was honoured by his partisans. He appears\r\nto have possessed little talent, saving a deep fund of hypocrisy,\r\nconsiderable powers of sophistry, and a cold exaggerated strain of\r\noratory, as foreign to good taste, as the measures he recommended were\r\nto ordinary humanity. It seemed wonderful, that even the seething and\r\nboiling of the revolutionary cauldron should have sent up from the\r\nbottom, and long supported on the surface, a thing so miserably void of\r\nclaims to public distinction; but Robespierre had to impose on the minds\r\nof the vulgar, and he knew how to beguile them, by accommodating his\r\nflattery to their passions and scale of understanding, and by acts of\r\ncunning and hypocrisy, which weigh more with the multitude than the\r\nwords of eloquence, or the arguments of wisdom. The people listened as\r\nto their Cicero, when he twanged out his apostrophes of _Pauvre Peuple,\r\nPeuple verteueux!_ and hastened to execute whatever came recommended by\r\nsuch honied phrases, though devised by the worst of men for the worst\r\nand most inhuman of purposes.\r\n\r\nVanity was Robespierre's ruling passion, and though his countenance was\r\nthe image of his mind, he was vain even of his personal appearance, and\r\nnever adopted the external habits of a sans culotte. Amongst his fellow\r\njacobins he was distinguished by the nicety with which his hair was\r\narranged and powdered; and the neatness of his dress was carefully\r\nattended to, so as to counterbalance, if possible, the vulgarity of his\r\nperson. His apartments, though small, were elegant, and vanity had\r\nfilled them with representations of the occupant. Robespierre's picture\r\nat length hung in one place, his miniature in another, his bust occupied\r\na niche, and on the table were disposed a few medallions exhibiting his\r\nhead in profile. The vanity which all this indicated was of the coldest\r\nand most selfish character, being such as considers neglect as insult,\r\nand receives homage merely as a tribute; so that, while praise is\r\nreceived without gratitude, it is withheld at the risk of mortal hate.\r\nSelf-love of this dangerous character is closely allied with envy, and\r\nRobespierre was one of the most envious and vindictive men that ever\r\nlived. He never was known to pardon any opposition, affront, or even\r\nrivalry; and to be marked in his tablets on such an account was a sure,\r\nthough perhaps not an immediate sentence of death. Danton was a hero,\r\ncompared with this cold, calculating, creeping miscreant; for his\r\npassions, though exaggerated, had at least some touch of humanity, and\r\nhis brutal ferocity was supported by brutal courage. Robespierre was a\r\ncoward, who signed death-warrants with a hand that shook, though his\r\nheart was relentless. He possessed no passions on which to charge his\r\ncrimes; they were perpetrated in cold blood, and upon mature\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\nMarat, the third of this infernal triumvirate, had attracted the\r\nattention of the lower orders, by the violence of his sentiments in the\r\njournal which he conducted from the commencement of the revolution, upon\r\nsuch principles that it took the lead in forwarding its successive\r\nchanges. His political exhortations began and ended like the howl of a\r\nblood-hound for murder; or, if a wolf could have written a journal, the\r\ngaunt and famished wretch could not have ravined more eagerly for\r\nslaughter. It was blood which was Marat's constant demand, not in drops\r\nfrom the breast of an individual, not in puny streams from the slaughter\r\nof families, but blood in the profusion of an ocean. His usual\r\ncalculation of the heads which he demanded amounted to two hundred and\r\nsixty thousand; and though he sometimes raised it as high as three\r\nhundred thousand, it never fell beneath the smaller number. It may be\r\nhoped, and, for the honour of human nature, we are inclined to believe,\r\nthere was a touch of insanity in this unnatural strain of ferocity; and\r\nthe wild and squalid features of the wretch appear to have intimated a\r\ndegree of alienation of mind. Marat was, like Robespierre, a coward.\r\nRepeatedly denounced in the Assembly, he skulked instead of defending\r\nhimself, and lay concealed in some obscure garret or cellar, among his\r\ncut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like a bird of ill omen, his\r\ndeath-screech was again heard. Such was the strange and fatal\r\ntriumvirate, in which the same degree of cannibal cruelty existed under\r\ndifferent aspects. Danton murdered to glut his rage; Robespierre to\r\navenge his injured vanity, or to remove a rival whom he envied! Marat,\r\nfrom the same instinctive love of blood, which induces a wolf to\r\ncontinue his ravage of the flocks long after his hunger is appeased.\r\n\r\nThese monsters ruled France for a time with the most despotic sway. The\r\nmost sanguinary laws were enacted--and the most vigilant system of\r\npolice maintained. Spies and informers were employed--and every murmur,\r\nand every expression unfavourable to the ruling powers was followed with\r\nthe sentence of death and its immediate execution.\r\n\r\n\"Men,\" says Scott, \"read Livy for the sake of discovering what degree of\r\nprivate crime might be committed under the mask of public virtue. The\r\ndeed of the younger Brutus, served any man as an apology to betray to\r\nruin and to death, a friend or a patron, whose patriotism might not be\r\nof the pitch which suited the time. Under the example of the elder\r\nBrutus, the nearest ties of blood were repeatedly made to give way\r\nbefore the ferocity of party zeal--a zeal too often assumed for the most\r\ninfamous and selfish purposes. As some fanatics of yore studied the old\r\ntestament for the purpose of finding examples of bad actions to\r\nvindicate those which themselves were tempted to commit, so the\r\nrepublicans of France, we mean the desperate and outrageous bigots of\r\nthe revolution, read history to justify, by classical instances, their\r\npublic and private crimes. Informers, those scourges of a state, were\r\nencouraged to a degree scarce known in ancient Rome in the time of the\r\nemperors, though Tacitus has hurled his thunders against them, as the\r\npoison and pest of his time. The duty of lodging such informations was\r\nunblushingly urged as indispensable. The safety of the republic being\r\nthe supreme charge of every citizen, he was on no account to hesitate in\r\n_denouncing_, as it was termed, any one whomsoever, or howsoever\r\nconnected with him,--the friend of his counsels, or the wife of his\r\nbosom,--providing he had reason to suspect the devoted individual of the\r\ncrime of _incivism_,--a crime the more mysteriously dreadful, as no one\r\nknew exactly its nature.\"\r\n\r\nIn this place we shall give an account of some of the scenes to which\r\nFrance was subject during this awful period. In order to render the\r\ntriumph complete, the leaders of the Jacobins determined upon a general\r\nmassacre of all the friends of the unfortunate Louis and the\r\nconstitution in the kingdom. For this purpose, suspected persons of all\r\nranks were collected in the prisons and jails, and on the 2d of\r\nSeptember, 1792, the work of death commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Massacre of Prisoners._\r\n\r\nThe number of individuals accumulated in the various prisons of Paris\r\nhad increased by the arrests and domiciliary visits subsequent to the\r\n10th of August, to about eight thousand persons. It was the object of\r\nthis infernal scheme to destroy the greater part of these under one\r\ngeneral system of murder, not to be executed by the sudden and furious\r\nimpulse of an armed multitude, but with a certain degree of cold blood\r\nand deliberate investigation. A force of armed banditti, Marsellois\r\npartly, and partly chosen ruffians of the Fauxbourgs, proceeded to the\r\nseveral prisons, into which they either forced their passage, or were\r\nadmitted by the jailers, most of whom had been apprised of what was to\r\ntake place, though some even of these steeled officials exerted\r\nthemselves to save those under their charge. A revolutionary tribunal\r\nwas formed from among the armed ruffians themselves, who examined the\r\nregisters of the prison, and summoned the captives individually to\r\nundergo the form of a trial. If the judges, as was almost always the\r\ncase, declared for death, their doom, to prevent the efforts of men in\r\ndespair, was expressed in the words \"Give the prisoner freedom.\" The\r\nvictim was then thrust out into the street, or yard; he was despatched\r\nby men and women, who, with sleeves tucked up, arms dyed elbow-deep in\r\nblood, hands holding axes, pikes, and sabres, were executioners of the\r\nsentence; and, by the manner in which they did their office on the\r\nliving, and mangled the bodies of the dead, showed that they occupied\r\nthe post as much from pleasure as from love of hire. They often\r\nexchanged places; the judges going out to take the executioners' duty,\r\nthe executioners, with reeking hands, sitting as judges in their turn.\r\nMailard, a ruffian alleged to have distinguished himself at the siege of\r\nthe Bastile, but better known by his exploits on the march to\r\nVersailles, presided during these brief and sanguinary investigations.\r\nHis companions on the bench were persons of the same stamp. Yet there\r\nwere occasions when they showed some transient gleams of humanity, and\r\nit is not unimportant to remark, that boldness had more influence on\r\nthem than any appeal to mercy or compassion. An avowed royalist was\r\noccasionally dismissed uninjured, while the constitutionalists were sure\r\nto be massacred. Another trait of a singular nature is, that two of the\r\nruffians who were appointed to guard one of these intended victims home\r\nin safety, as if they were acquitted, insisted on seeing his meeting\r\nwith his family, seemed to share in the transports of the moment, and on\r\ntaking leave, shook the hand of their late prisoner, while their own\r\nwere clotted with the gore of his friends, and had been just raised to\r\nshed his own. Few, indeed, and brief, were these symptoms of relenting.\r\nIn general, the doom of the prisoner was death, and that doom was\r\ninstantly accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the captives were penned up in their dungeons like\r\ncattle in a shambles, and in many instances might, from windows which\r\nlooked outwards, mark the fate of their comrades, hear their cries, and\r\nbehold their struggles, and learn from the horrible scene, how they\r\nmight best meet their own approaching fate. They observed, according to\r\nSt. Meard, who, in his well-named Agony of Thirty-Six Hours, has given\r\nthe account of this fearful scene, that those who intercepted the blows\r\nof the executioners, by holding up their hands, suffered protracted\r\ntorment, while those who offered no show of struggle were more easily\r\ndespatched; and they encouraged each other to submit to their fate, in\r\nthe manner least likely to prolong their sufferings.\r\n\r\nMany ladies, especially those belonging to the court, were thus\r\nmurdered. The Princess de Lamballe, whose only crime seems to have been\r\nher friendship for Marie Antoinette, was literally hewn to pieces, and\r\nher head, and that of others, paraded on pikes through the metropolis.\r\nIt was carried to the temple on that accursed weapon, the features yet\r\nbeautiful in death, and the long fair curls of the hair floating around\r\nthe spear. The murderers insisted that the King and Queen should be\r\ncompelled to come to the window to view this dreadful trophy. The\r\nmunicipal officers who were upon duty over the royal prisoners, had\r\ndifficulty, not merely in saving them from this horrible inhumanity, but\r\nalso in preventing their prison from being forced. Three-coloured\r\nribbons were extended across the street, and this frail barrier was\r\nfound sufficient to intimate that the Temple was under the safeguard of\r\nthe nation. We do not read that the efficiency of the three-coloured\r\nribbons was tried for the protection of any of the other prisoners. No\r\ndoubt the executioners had their instructions where and when they should\r\nbe respected.\r\n\r\nThe clergy, who had declined the constitutional oath from pious\r\nscruples, were, during the massacre, the peculiar objects of insult and\r\ncruelty, and their conduct was such as corresponded with their religious\r\nand conscientious professions. They were seen confessing themselves to\r\neach other, or receiving the confessions of their lay companions in\r\nmisfortune, and encouraging them to undergo the evil hour, with as much\r\ncalmness as if they had not been to share its bitterness. As\r\nprotestants, we cannot abstractedly approve of the doctrines which\r\nrender the established clergy of one country dependant upon the\r\nsovereign pontiff, the prince of an alien state. But these priests did\r\nnot make the laws for which they suffered; they only obeyed them; and as\r\nmen and christians we must regard them as martyrs, who preferred death\r\nto what they considered as apostacy.\r\n\r\nIn the brief intervals of this dreadful butchery, which lasted four\r\ndays, the judges and executioners ate, drank, and slept: and awoke from\r\nslumber, or arose from their meal, with fresh appetite for murder. There\r\nwere places arranged for the male, and for the female murderers, for the\r\nwork had been incomplete without the intervention of the latter. Prison\r\nafter prison was invested, entered, and under the same form of\r\nproceeding made the scene of the same inhuman butchery. The Jacobins had\r\nreckoned on making the massacre universal over France. But the example\r\nwas not generally followed. It required, as in the case of St.\r\nBartholomew, the only massacre which can be compared to this in\r\natrocity, the excitation of a large capital, in a violent crisis, to\r\nrender such horrors possible.\r\n\r\nThe community of Paris were not in fault for this. They did all they\r\ncould to extend the sphere of murder. Their warrant brought from Orleans\r\nnear sixty persons, including the Duke de Cosse-Brissac, De Lesart the\r\nlate minister, and other royalists of distinction, who were to have been\r\ntried before the high court of that department. A band of assassins met\r\nthem, by appointment of the community, at Versailles, who, uniting with\r\ntheir escort, murdered almost the whole of the unhappy men.\r\n\r\nFrom the 2d to the 6th of September, these infernal crimes proceeded\r\nuninterrupted, protracted by the actors for the sake of the daily pay of\r\na louis to each, openly distributed amongst them, by order of the\r\nCommune. It was either from a desire to continue as long as possible a\r\nlabour so well requited, or because these beings had acquired an\r\ninsatiable lust of murder, that, when the jails were emptied of state\r\ncriminals, the assassins attacked the Bicetre, a prison where ordinary\r\ndelinquents were confined. These unhappy wretches offered a degree of\r\nresistance which cost the assailants more dear than any they had\r\nexperienced from their proper victims. They were obliged to fire on them\r\nwith cannon, and many hundreds of the miserable creatures were in thus\r\nway exterminated, by wretches worse than themselves.\r\n\r\nNo exact account was ever made of the number of persons murdered during\r\nthis dreadful period; but not above two or three hundred of the\r\nprisoners arrested for state offences were known to escape, or be\r\ndischarged, and the most moderate computation raises the number of those\r\nwho fell to two or three thousand, though some carry it to twice the\r\nextent. Truchod announced to the Legislative Assembly, that four\r\nthousand had perished. Some exertion was made to save the lives of those\r\nimprisoned for debt, whose numbers, with those of common felons, may\r\nmake up the balance betwixt the number slain and eight thousand who were\r\nprisoners when the massacre began. The bodies were interred in heaps, in\r\nimmense trenches, prepared beforehand by order of the community of\r\nParis; but their bones have since been transferred to the subterranean\r\ncatacombs, which form the general charnel-house of the city. In those\r\nmelancholy regions, while other relics of mortality lie exposed all\r\naround, the remains of those who perished in the massacres of September,\r\nare alone secluded from the eye. The vault in which they repose is\r\nclosed with a screen of freestone, as if relating to crimes unfit to be\r\nthought of even in the proper abode of death; and which France would\r\nwillingly hide in oblivion.\r\n\r\nAfter this dreadful massacre, the Jacobins eagerly demanded the life of\r\nLouis XVI. He was accordingly tried by the convention and condemned to\r\nbe beheaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death of Louis XVI. and other Members of the Royal Family._\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of January, 1793, Louis XVI. was publicly beheaded in the\r\nmidst of his own metropolis, in the _Place Louis Quinze_, erected to the\r\nmemory of his grandfather. It is possible, for the critical eye of the\r\nhistorian, to discover much weakness in the conduct of this unhappy\r\nmonarch; for he had neither the determination to fight for his rights,\r\nnor the power of submitting with apparent indifference to circumstances\r\nwhere resistance inferred danger. He submitted, indeed, but with so bad\r\na grace, that he only made himself suspected of cowardice, without\r\ngetting credit for voluntary concession. But yet his behaviour on many\r\ntrying occasions effectually vindicate him from the charge of timidity,\r\nand showed that the unwillingness to shed blood, by which he was\r\npeculiarly distinguished, arose from benevolence, not from\r\npusillanimity.\r\n\r\nUpon the scaffold, he behaved with the firmness which became a noble\r\nspirit, and the patience beseeming one who was reconciled to heaven. As\r\none of the few marks of sympathy with which his sufferings were\r\nsoftened, the attendance of a confessor, who had not taken the\r\nconstitutional oath, was permitted to the dethroned monarch. He who\r\nundertook the honourable but dangerous office, was a gentleman of gifted\r\nfamily of Edgeworth of Edgeworthstown; and the devoted zeal with which\r\nhe rendered the last duties to Louis, had like in the issue to have\r\nproved fatal to himself. As the instrument of death descended, the\r\nconfessor pronounced the impressive words,--\"Son of Saint Louis, ascend\r\nto heaven!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a last will of Louis XVI. circulated upon good authority,\r\nbearing this remarkable passage:--\"I recommend to my son, should you\r\nhave the misfortune to become king, to recollect that his whole\r\nfaculties are due to the service of the public; that he ought to consult\r\nthe happiness of his people, by governing according to the laws,\r\nforgetting all injuries and misfortunes, and in particular those which I\r\nmay have sustained. But while I exhort him to govern under the authority\r\nof the laws, I cannot but add, that this will be only in his power, in\r\nso far as he shall be endowed with authority to cause right to be\r\nrespected, and wrong punished; and that without such authority, his\r\nsituation in the government must be more hurtful than advantageous to\r\nthe state.\"\r\n\r\nNot to mingle the fate of the illustrious victim of the royal family\r\nwith the general tale of the sufferers under the reign of terror, we\r\nmust here mention the deaths of the rest of that illustrious house,\r\nwhich closed for a time a monarchy, that existing through three\r\ndynasties, had given sixty-six kings to France.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be supposed, that the queen was to be long permitted to\r\nsurvive her husband. She had been even more than he the object of\r\nrevolutionary detestation; nay, many were disposed to throw on Marie\r\nAntoinette, almost exclusively, the blame of those measures which they\r\nconsidered as counter-revolutionary.\r\n\r\nThe terms of her accusation were too basely depraved to be even hinted\r\nat here. She scorned to reply to it, but appealed to all who had been\r\nmothers, against the very possibility of the horrors which were stated\r\nagainst her. The widow of a king, the sister of an emperor, was\r\ncondemned to death, dragged in an open tumbril to the place of\r\nexecution, and beheaded on the 16th October, 1793. She suffered death in\r\nher 39th year.\r\n\r\nThe princess Elizabeth, sister of Louis, of whom it might he said, in\r\nthe words of lord Clarendon, that she resembled a chapel in a king's\r\npalace, into which nothing but piety and morality enter, while all\r\naround is filled with sin, idleness, and folly, did not, by the most\r\nharmless demeanour and inoffensive character, escape the miserable fate\r\nin which the Jacobins had determined to involve the whole family of\r\nLouis XVI. Part of the accusation redounded to the honour of her\r\ncharacter. She was accused of having admitted to the apartments of the\r\nTuilleries some of the national guards, of the section of Filles de\r\nSaint Thomas, and causing the wounds to be looked to which they had\r\nreceived in a skirmish with the Marsellois, immediately before the 10th\r\nof August. The princess admitted her having done so, and it was exactly\r\nin consistence with her whole conduct. Another charge stated the\r\nridiculous accusation, that she had distributed bullets chewed by\r\nherself and her attendants, to render then more fatal, to the defenders\r\nof the castle of the Tuilleries; a ridiculous fable, of which there was\r\nno proof whatever. She was beheaded in May, 1794, and met her death as\r\nbecame the manner in which her life had been spent.\r\n\r\nWe are weary of recounting these atrocities, as others must be of\r\nreading them. Yet it is not useless that men should see how far human\r\nnature can be carried, in contradiction to every feeling the most\r\nsacred, to every pleading, whether of justice or of humanity. The\r\nDauphin we have already described as a promising child of seven years\r\nold, an age at which no offence could have been given, and from which no\r\ndanger could have been apprehended. Nevertheless, it was resolved to\r\ndestroy the innocent child, and by means to which ordinary murders seem\r\ndeeds of mercy.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy boy was put in charge of the most hard-hearted villain whom the\r\ncommunity of Paris, well acquainted where such agents were to be found, were\r\nable to select from their band of Jacobins. This wretch, a shoemaker called\r\nSimon, asked his employers, \"what was to be done with the young wolf-whelp;\r\nWas he to be slain?\"--\"No?\"--\"Poisoned?\"--\"No.\"--\"Starved to death?\"--\"No.\"\r\n\"What then?\"--\"He was to be got rid of.\" Accordingly, by a continuance of\r\nthe most severe treatment--by beating, cold, vigils, fasts, and ill usage\r\nof every kind, so frail a blossom was soon blighted. He died on the 8th\r\nJune, 1795.\r\n\r\nAfter this last horrible crime, there was a relaxation in favour of the\r\ndaughter, and now the sole child of this unhappy house. The princess\r\nroyal, whose qualities have honoured even her birth and blood,\r\nexperienced from this period a mitigated captivity. Finally, on the\r\n19th December, 1795, this last remaining relic of the family of Louis,\r\nwas permitted to leave her prison and her country, in exchange for La\r\nFayette and others, whom, on that condition, Austria delivered from\r\ncaptivity. She became afterwards the wife of her cousin, the duke\r\nd'Angouleme, eldest son of the reigning monarch of France, and obtained,\r\nby the manner in which she conducted herself at Bourdeaux in 1815, the\r\nhighest praise for gallantry and spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dreadful scenes in La Vendee._\r\n\r\nIn La Vendee, one of the departments of France, an insurrection broke\r\nout against the Jacobinical government, in 1793.\r\n\r\nUpwards of two hundred battles and skirmishes were fought in this\r\ndevoted country. The revolutionary fever was in its access; the shedding\r\nof blood seemed to have become positive pleasure to the perpetrators of\r\nslaughter, and was varied by each invention which cruelty could invent\r\nto give it new zest. The habitations of the Vendeans were destroyed,\r\ntheir families subjected to violation and massacre, their cattle houghed\r\nand slaughtered, and their crops burnt and wasted. One republican column\r\nassumed and merited the name of the Infernal, by the horrid atrocities\r\nwhich they committed. At Pilau, they roasted the women and children in a\r\nheated oven. Many similar horrors could be added, did not the heart and\r\nhand recoil from the task. Without quoting any more special instances of\r\nhorror, we use the words of a republican eye witness, to express the\r\ngeneral spectacle presented by the theatre of public conflict.\r\n\r\n\"I did not see a single male being at the towns of St. Hermand,\r\nChantonnay, or Herbiers. A few women alone had escaped the sword.\r\nCountry-seats, cottages, habitations of whichever kind, were burnt. The\r\nherds and flocks were wandering in terror around their usual places of\r\nshelter, now smoking in ruins. I was surprised by night, but the\r\nwavering and dismal blaze of conflagration afforded light over the\r\ncountry. To the bleating of the terrified flocks, and bellowing of the\r\nterrified cattle, was joined the deep hoarse notes of carrion crows, and\r\nthe yells of wild animals coming from the recesses of the woods to prey\r\nupon the carcasses of the slain. At length a distant colume of fire,\r\nwidening and increasing as I approached, served me as a beacon. It was\r\nthe town of Mortagne in flames. When I arrived there, no living\r\ncreatures were to be seen, save a few wretched women who were striving\r\nto save some remnants of their property from the general\r\nconflagration.\"--_Les Memoires d'un Ancien Administrateur des Armees\r\nRepublicaines._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scenes at Marseilles and Lyons._\r\n\r\nMarseilles, Toulon, and Lyons, had declared themselves against the\r\nJacobin supremacy. Rich from commerce and their maratime situation,\r\nand, in the case of Lyons, from their command of internal navigation,\r\nthe wealthy merchants and manufacturers of those cities foresaw the\r\ntotal insecurity of property, and in consequence of their own ruin, in\r\nthe system of arbitrary spoliation and murder upon which the government\r\nof the Jacobins was founded. But property, for which they were\r\nsolicitous, though, if its natural force is used in time, the most\r\npowerful barrier to withstand revolution, becomes, after a certain\r\nperiod of delay, its helpless victim. If the rich are in due season\r\nliberal of their means, they have the power of enlisting in their cause,\r\nand as adherents, those among the lower orders, who, if they see their\r\nsuperiors dejected and despairing, will be tempted to consider them as\r\nobjects of plunder. But this must be done early, or those who might be\r\nmade the most active defenders of property, will join with such as are\r\nprepared to make a prey of it.\r\n\r\nMarseilles showed at once her good will and her impotency of means. The\r\nutmost exertions of that wealthy city, whose revolutionary band had\r\ncontributed so much to the downfall of the monarchy in the attack on the\r\nTuilleries, were able to equip only a small and doubtful army of about\r\n3000 men, who were despatched to the relief of Lyons. This\r\ninconsiderable army threw themselves into Avignon, and were defeated\r\nwith the utmost ease, by the republican general Cartaux, despicable as a\r\nmilitary officer, and whose forces would not have stood a single\r\n_engaillement_ of Vendean sharp-shooters. Marseilles received the\r\nvictors, and bowed her head to the subsequent horrors which it pleased\r\nCartaux, with two formidable Jacobins, Barras and Ferron, to inflict on\r\nthat flourishing city. The place underwent the usual terrors of Jacobin\r\npurifaction, and was for a time affectedly called \"nameless commune.\"\r\n\r\nLyons made a more honourable stand. That noble city had been subjected\r\nfor some time to the domination of Chalier, one of the most ferocious,\r\nand at the same time one of the most extravagantly absurd, of the\r\nJacobins. He was at the head of a formidable club, which was worthy of\r\nbeing affiliated with the mother society, and ambitious of treading in\r\nits footsteps; and he was supported by a garrison of two revolutionary\r\nregiments, besides a numerous artillery, and a large addition of\r\nvolunteers, amounting in all to about ten thousand men, forming what was\r\ncalled a revolutionary army. This Chalier, was an apostate priest, an\r\natheist, and a thorough-paced pupil in the school of terror. He had been\r\nprocureur of the community, and had imposed on the wealthy citizens a\r\ntax, which was raised from six to thirty millions of livres. But blood\r\nas well as gold was his object. The massacre of a few priests and\r\naristocrats confined in the fortress of Pierre-Scixe, was a pitiful\r\nsacrifice; and Chalier, ambitious of deeds more decisive, caused a\r\ngeneral arrest of an hundred principal citizens, whom he destined as a\r\nhecatomb more worthy of the demon whom he served.\r\n\r\nThis sacrifice was prevented by the courage of the Lyonnois; a courage\r\nwhich, if assumed by the Parisians, might have prevented most of the\r\nhorrors which disgraced the revolution. The meditated slaughter was\r\nalready announced by Chalier to the Jacobin club. \"Three hundred heads,\"\r\nhe said, \"are marked for slaughter. Let us lose no time in seizing the\r\nmembers of the departmental office-bearers, the presidents and\r\nsecretaries of the sections, all the local authorities who obstruct our\r\nrevolutionary measures. Let us make one fagot of the whole, and deliver\r\nthem at once to the guillotine.\"\r\n\r\nBut ere he could execute his threat, terror was awakened into the\r\ncourage of despair. The citizens rose in arms and besieged the Hotel de\r\nVille, in which Chalier, with his revolutionary troops, made a\r\ndesperate, and for some time a successful, yet ultimately a vain\r\ndefence. But the Lyonnois unhappily knew not how to avail themselves of\r\ntheir triumph. They were not sufficiently aware of the nature of the\r\nvengeance which they had provoked, or of the necessity of supporting the\r\nbold step which they had taken, by measures which precluded a\r\ncompromise. Their resistance to the violence and atrocity of the\r\nJacobins had no political character, any more than that offered by the\r\ntraveller against robbers who threaten him with plunder and murder. They\r\nwere not sufficiently aware, that, having done so much, they must\r\nnecessarily do more. They ought, by declaring themselves royalists, to\r\nhave endeavoured to prevail on the troops of Savoy, if not on the Swiss,\r\n(who had embraced a species of neutrality, which, after the 10th of\r\nAugust, was dishonourable to their ancient reputation,) to send in all\r\nhaste, soldiery to the assistance of a city which had no fortifications\r\nor regular troops to defend it; but which possessed, nevertheless,\r\ntreasures to pay their auxiliaries, and strong hands and able officers\r\nto avail themselves of the localities of their situation, which, when\r\nwell defended, are sometimes as formidable as the regular protection\r\nerected by scientific engineers.\r\n\r\nThe people of Lyons vainly endeavoured to establish a revolutionary\r\ncharacter for themselves upon the system of Gironde; two of whose\r\nproscribed deputies tried to draw them over to their unpopular and\r\nhopeless cause: and they inconsistently sought protection by affecting a\r\nrepublican zeal, even while resisting the decrees, and defeating the\r\ntroops of the Jacobins. There were undoubtedly many of royalist\r\nprinciples among the insurgents, and some of their leaders were\r\ndecidedly such; but these were not numerous or influential enough to\r\nestablish the true principle of open resistance, and the ultimate chance\r\nof rescue, by a bold proclamation of the king's interest. They still\r\nappealed to the convention as their legitimate sovereign, in whose eyes\r\nthey endeavoured to vindicate themselves, and at the same time tried to\r\nsecure the interest of two Jacobin deputies, who had countenanced every\r\nviolation attempted by Chalier, that they might prevail upon them to\r\nrepresent their conduct favourably. Of course they had enough of\r\npromises to this effect, while Messrs. Guathier and Nioche, the deputies\r\nin question, remained in their power; promises, doubtless the more\r\nreadily given, that the Lyonnois, though desirous to conciliate the\r\nfavour of the convention, did not hesitate in proceeding to the\r\npunishment of the Jacobin Chalier. He was condemned and executed, along\r\nwith one of his principal associates, termed Reard.\r\n\r\nTo defend these vigourous proceedings, the unhappy insurgents placed\r\nthemselves under the interim government of a council, who, still\r\ndesirous to temporize and maintain the revolutionary character, termed\r\nthemselves \"the popular and republican commission of public safety of\r\nthe department of the Rhine and Loire;\" a title which, while it excited\r\nno popular enthusiasm, and attracted no foreign aid, no ways soothed,\r\nbut rather exasperated, the resentment of the convention, now under the\r\nabsolute domination of the Jacobins, by whom every thing short of\r\ncomplete fraternization was accounted presumptuous defiance. Those who\r\nwere not with them, it was their policy to hold as their most decided\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThe Lyonnois had indeed letters of encouragement, and promised\r\nconcurrence, from several departments; but no effectual support was ever\r\ndirected to their city, excepting the petty reinforcement from\r\nMarseilles, which we have seen was intercepted and dispersed with little\r\ntrouble by the Jacobin general, Cartaux.\r\n\r\nLyons had expected to become the patroness and focus of an Anti-Jacobin\r\nleague, formed by the great commercial towns, against Paris and the\r\npredominant part of the convention. She found herself isolated and\r\nunsupported, and left to oppose her own proper forces and means of\r\ndefence, to an army of sixty thousand men, and to the numerous Jacobins\r\ncontained within her own walls. About the end of July, after a lapse of\r\nan interval of two months, a regular blockade was formed around the\r\ncity, and in the first week of August, hostilities took place. The\r\nbesieging army was directed in its military character by general\r\nKellerman, who, with other distinguished soldiers, had now began to hold\r\nan eminent rank in the republican armies. But for the purpose of\r\nexecuting the vengeance for which they thirsted, the Jacobins relied\r\nchiefly on the exertions of the deputies they had sent along with the\r\ncommander, and especially of the representative, Dubois Crance, a man\r\nwhose sole merit appears to have been his frantic Jacobinism. General\r\nPercy, formerly an officer in the royal service, undertook the almost\r\nhopeless task of defence, and by forming redoubts on the most commanding\r\nsituations around the town, commenced a resistance against the immensely\r\nsuperior force of the besiegers, which was honourable if it could have\r\nbeen useful. The Lyonnois, at the same time, still endeavoured to make\r\nfair weather with the besieging army, by representing themselves as firm\r\nrepublicans. They celebrated as a public festival the anniversary of the\r\n10th of August, while Dubois Crance, to show the credit he gave them for\r\ntheir republican zeal, fixed the same day for commencing his fire on the\r\nplace, and caused the first gun to be discharged by his own concubine, a\r\nfemale born in Lyons. Bombs and red-hot bullets were next resorted to,\r\nagainst the second city of the French empire; while the besieged\r\nsustained the attack with a constancy, and on many parts repelled it\r\nwith a courage highly honourable to their character. But their fate was\r\ndetermined. The deputies announced to the convention their purpose of\r\npouring their instruments of havoc on every quarter of the town at once,\r\nand when it was on fire in several places, to attempt a general storm.\r\n\"The city,\" they said, \"must surrender, or there shall not remain one\r\nstone upon another, and this we hope to accomplish in spite of the\r\nsuggestions of false compassion. Do not then be surprised when you hear\r\nthat Lyons exists no longer.\" The fury of the attack threatened to make\r\ngood these promises.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the citizens became intolerable. Several quarters of\r\nthe city were on fire at the same time, immense magazines were burnt to\r\nthe ground, and a loss incurred, during two night's bombardment, which\r\nwas calculated at two hundred millions of livres. A black flag was\r\nhoisted by the besieged on the Great Hospital, as a sign that the fire\r\nof the assailants should not be directed on that asylum of hopeless\r\nmisery. The signal seemed only to draw the republican bombs to the spot\r\nwhere they could create the most frightful distresses, and outrage in\r\nthe highest degree the feelings of humanity. The devastations of famine\r\nwere soon added to those of slaughter; and after two months of such\r\nhorrors had been sustained, it became obvious that farther resistance\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\nThe parylitic Couthon, with Collot D'Herbois, and other deputies were\r\nsent to Lyons by the committee of public safety, to execute the\r\nvengeance which the Jacobins demanded; while Dubois Crance was recalled,\r\nfor having put, it was thought, less energy to his proceedings than the\r\nprosecution of the siege required. Collot D'Herbois had a personal\r\nmotive of a singular nature for delighting in the task intrusted to him\r\nand his colleagues. In his capacity of a play-actor, he had been hissed\r\nfrom the stage at Lyons, and the door to revenge was now open. The\r\ninstructions of this committee enjoined them to take the most\r\nsatisfactory revenge for the death of Chalier and the insurrection of\r\nLyons, not merely on the citizens, but on the town itself. The principal\r\nstreets and buildings were to be levelled with the ground, and a\r\nmonument erected where they stood, was to record the cause:--\"_Lyons\r\nrebelled against the Republic--Lyons is no more._\" Such fragments of the\r\ntown as might be permitted to remain, were to bear the name of Ville\r\nAffranchie. It will scarce be believed that a doom like that which might\r\nhave passed the lips of some eastern despot, in all the frantic madness\r\nof arbitrary power and utter ignorance, could have been seriously\r\npronounced, and as seriously enforced, in one of the most civilized\r\nnations in Europe; and that to the present enlightened age, men who\r\npretended to wisdom and philosophy, should have considered the labours\r\nof the architect as a proper subject of punishment. So it was, however;\r\nand to give the demolition more effect, the impotent Couthon was carried\r\nfrom house to house, devoting each to ruin, by striking the door with a\r\nsilver hammer, and pronouncing these words--\"House of a rebel. I condemn\r\nthee in the name of the law.\" Workmen followed in great multitudes, who\r\nexecuted the sentence by pulling the house down to the foundations. This\r\nwanton demolition continued for six months, and is said to have been\r\ncarried on at an expense equal to that which the superb military\r\nhospital, the Hotel des Invalides, cost its founder, Louis XIV. But\r\nrepublican vengeance did not waste itself exclusively upon senseless\r\nlime and stone--it sought out sentient victims.\r\n\r\nThe deserved death of Chalier had been atoned by an apotheosis executed\r\nafter Lyons had surrendered; but Collot D'Herbois declared that every\r\ndrop of that patriotic blood fell as if scalding his own heart, and that\r\nthe murder demanded atonement. All ordinary process, and every usual\r\nmode of execution, was thought too tardy to avenge the death of a\r\nJacobin proconsul. The judges of the revolutionary commission were worn\r\nout with fatigue--the arm of the executioner was weary--the very steel\r\nof the guillotine was blunted. Collot D'Herbois devised a more summary\r\nmode of slaughter. A number of from two to three hundred victims at once\r\nwere dragged from prison to the place de Baotteaux, one of the largest\r\nsquares in Lyons, and there subjected to a fire of grape-shot.\r\nEfficacious as this mode of execution may seem, it was neither speedy\r\nnor merciful. The sufferers fell to the ground like singed flies,\r\nmutilated but not slain, and imploring their executioners to despatch\r\nthem speedily. This was done with sabres and bayonets, and with such\r\nhaste and zeal, that some of the jailers and assistants were slain along\r\nwith those whom they had assisted in dragging to death; and the mistake\r\nwas not discerned, until, upon counting the dead bodies, the military\r\nmurderers found them to amount to more than the destined tale. The\r\nbodies of the dead were thrown into the Rhone, to carry news of the\r\nrepublican vengeance, as Collot D'Herbois expressed himself, to Toulon,\r\nthen also in a state of revolt. But the sullen stream rejected the\r\noffice imposed on it, and headed back the dead in heaps upon the banks;\r\nand the committee of Representatives was compelled at length to allow\r\nthe relics of their cruelty to be interred, to prevent the risk of\r\ncontagion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Installation of the Goddess of Reason._\r\n\r\nAt length the zeal of the infuriated Atheists in France hurried them to\r\nthe perpetration of one of the most ridiculous, and at the same time\r\nimpious transactions which ever disgraced the annals of any nation. It\r\nwas no less than a formal renunciation of the existence of a Supreme\r\nBeing, and the installation of the _Goddess of Reason_, in 1793.\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" says Scott, \"a fanaticism of atheism, as well as of\r\nsuperstitious belief; and a philosopher can harbour and express as much\r\nmalice against those who persevere in believing what he is pleased to\r\ndenounce as unworthy of credence, as an ignorant and bigoted priest can\r\nbear against a man who cannot yield faith to dogmata which he thinks\r\ninsufficiently proved.\" Accordingly, the throne being totally\r\nannihilated, it appeared to the philosophers of the school of Hebert,\r\n(who was author of the most gross and beastly periodical paper of the\r\ntime, called the _Pere du Chene_) that in totally destroying such\r\nvestiges of religion and public worship as were still retained by the\r\npeople of France, there was room for a splendid triumph of liberal\r\nopinions. It was not enough, they said, for a regenerate nation to have\r\ndethroned earthly kings, unless she stretched out the arm of defiance\r\ntowards those powers which superstition had represented as reigning over\r\nboundless space.\r\n\r\nAn unhappy man, named Gobet, constitutional bishop of Paris, was brought\r\nforward to play the principal part in the most impudent and scandalous\r\nfarce ever acted in the face of a national representation.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the leaders of the scene had some difficulty in inducing\r\nthe bishop to comply with the task assigned him, which, after all, he\r\nexecuted, not without present tears and subsequent remorse. But he did\r\nplay the part prescribed. He was brought forward in full procession, to\r\ndeclare to the convention, that the religion which he had taught so many\r\nyears, was, in every respect, a piece of priestcraft, which had no\r\nfoundation either in history or sacred truth. He disowned, in solemn and\r\nexplicit terms, the existence of the Deity to whose worship he had been\r\nconsecrated, and devoted himself in future to the homage of liberty,\r\nequality, virtue, and morality. He then laid on the table his episcopal\r\ndecorations, and received a fraternal embrace from the president of the\r\nconvention. Several apostate priests followed the example of this\r\nprelate.\r\n\r\nThe gold and silver plate of the churches was seized upon and\r\ndesecrated, processions entered the convention, travestied in priestly\r\ngarments, and singing the most profane hymns; while many of the chalices\r\nand sacred vessels were applied by Chaumette and Hebert to the\r\ncelebration of their own impious orgies. The world for the first time,\r\nheard an assembly of men, born and educated in civilization, and\r\nassuming the right to govern one of the finest of the European nations,\r\nuplift their united voice to deny the most solemn truth which man's soul\r\nreceives, and renounce unanimously the belief and worship of a Deity.\r\nFor a short time the same mad profanity continued to be acted upon.\r\n\r\nOne of the ceremonies of this insane time stands unrivalled for\r\nabsurdity, combined with impiety. The doors of the convention were\r\nthrown open to a band of musicians; preceded by whom, the members of the\r\nmunicipal body entered in solemn procession, singing a hymn in praise of\r\nliberty, and escorting, as the object of their future worship, a veiled\r\nfemale, whom they termed the Goddess of Reason. Being brought within the\r\nbar, she was unveiled with great form, and placed on the right hand of\r\nthe president; when she was generally recognized as a dancing-girl of\r\nthe opera, with whose charms most of the persons present were acquainted\r\nfrom her appearance on the stage, while the experience of individuals\r\nwas farther extended. To this person, as the fittest representative of\r\nthat reason whom they worshipped the national convention of France\r\nrendered public homage.\r\n\r\nThis impious and ridiculous mummery had a certain fashion; and the\r\ninstallation of the Goddess of reason was renewed and imitated\r\nthroughout the nation, in such places where the inhabitants desired to\r\nshow themselves equal to all the heights of the revolution. The churches\r\nwere, in most districts of France, closed against priests and\r\nworshippers--the bells were broken and cast into cannon--the whole\r\necclesiastical establishment destroyed--and the republican inscription\r\nover the cemeteries, declaring death to be perpetual sleep, announced to\r\nthose who lived under that dominion, that they were to hope no redress\r\neven in the next world.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with these laws affecting religion, was that which\r\nreduced the union of marriage, the most sacred engagement which human\r\nbeings can form, and the permanence of which leads most strongly to the\r\nconsolidation of society, to the state of a mere civil contract of a\r\ntransitory character, which any two persons might engage in, and cast\r\nloose at pleasure, when their taste was changed, or their appetite\r\ngratified. If fiends had set themselves to work, to discover a mode of\r\nmost effectually destroying whatever is venerable, graceful, or\r\npermanent in domestic life, and of obtaining at the same time an\r\nassurance that the mischief which it was their object to create should\r\nbe perpetuated from one generation to another, they could not have\r\ninvented a more effectual plan than the degradation of marriage into a\r\nstate of mere occasional co-habitation, or licensed concubinage. Sophie\r\nArnoult, an actress famous for the witty things she said, described the\r\nrepublican marriage as the sacrament of adultery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fall of Danton, Robespierre, Marat and other Jacobins._\r\n\r\nThese monsters fell victims by the same means they had used for the\r\ndestruction of others. Marat was poignarded in 1793, by Charlotte\r\nCorday, a young female, who had cherished in a feeling between lunacy\r\nand heroism, the ambition of ridding the world of a tyrant. Danton was\r\nguillotined in 1794. Robespierre followed soon after. His fall is thus\r\ndescribed by Scott in his life of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nAt length his fate urged him on to the encounter. Robespierre descended\r\nto the convention, where he had of late but rarely appeared, like the\r\nfar nobler dictator of Rome; and in his case also, a band of senators\r\nwas ready to poignard the tyrant on the spot, had they not been afraid\r\nof the popularity he was supposed to enjoy, and which they feared might\r\nrender them instant victims to the revenge of the Jacobins. The speech\r\nwhich Robespierre addressed to the convention was as menacing as the\r\nfirst distant rustle of the hurricane, and dark and lurid as the eclipse\r\nwhich announces its approach. Anxious murmurs had been heard among the\r\npopulace who filled the tribunes, or crowded the entrances of the hall\r\nof the convention, indicating that a second 31st of May (being the day\r\non which the Jacobins proscribed the Girondists) was about to witness a\r\nsimilar operation.\r\n\r\nThe first theme of the gloomy orator was the display of his own virtues\r\nand his services as a patriot, distinguishing as enemies to their\r\ncountry all whose opinions were contrary to his own. He then reviewed\r\nsuccessively the various departments of the government, and loaded them\r\nin turn with censure and contempt. He declaimed against the supineness\r\nof the committees of public safety and public security, as if the\r\nguillotine had never been in exercise; and he accused the committee of\r\nfinance of having _counter-revolutionized_ the revenues of the republic.\r\nHe enlarged with no less bitterness on withdrawing the artillery-men\r\n(always violent Jacobins) from Paris, and on the mode of management\r\nadopted in the conquered countries of Belgium. It seemed as if he wished\r\nto collect within the same lists all the functionaries of the state, and\r\nin the same breath to utter defiance to them all.\r\n\r\nThe usual honorary motion was made to print the discourse; but then the\r\nstorm of opposition broke forth, and many speakers vociferously\r\ndemanded, that before so far adopting the grave inculpations which it\r\ncontained, the discourse should be referred to the two committees.\r\nRobespierre in his turn, exclaimed, that this was subjecting his speech\r\nto the partial criticism and revision of the very parties whom he had\r\naccused. Exculpations and defences were heard on all sides against the\r\ncharges which had been thus sweepingly brought forward; and there were\r\nmany deputies who complained in no obscure terms of individual tyranny,\r\nand of a conspiracy on foot to outlaw and murder such part of the\r\nconvention as might be disposed to offer resistance. Robespierre was but\r\nfeebly supported, save by Saint Just, Couthon, and by his own brother.\r\nAfter a stormy debate, in which the convention were alternately swayed\r\nby their fear and their hatred of Robespierre, the discourse was finally\r\nreferred to the committees, instead of being printed; and the haughty\r\nand sullen dictator saw in the open slight, thus put on his measures and\r\nopinions, the sure mark of his approaching fall.\r\n\r\nHe carried his complaints to the Jacobin Club, to repose, as he\r\nexpressed it, his patriotic sorrows in their virtuous bosoms, where\r\nalone he hoped to find succour and sympathy. To this partial audience he\r\nrenewed, in a tone of yet greater audacity, the complaints with which he\r\nhad loaded every branch of the government, and the representative body\r\nitself. He reminded those around him of various heroic eras, when their\r\npresence and their pikes had decided the votes of the trembling\r\ndeputies. He reminded them of their pristine actions of revolutionary\r\nvigour--asked them if they had forgot the road to the convention, and\r\nconcluded by pathetically assuring them, that if they forsook him, \"he\r\nstood resigned to his fate; and they should behold with what courage he\r\nwould drink the fatal hemlock.\" The artist David, caught him by the hand\r\nas he closed, exclaiming, in rapture at his elocution, \"I will drink it\r\nwith thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinguished painter has been reproached, as having, on the\r\nsubsequent day, declined the pledge which he seemed so eagerly to\r\nembrace. But there were many of his original opinion, at the time he\r\nexpressed it so boldly; and had Robespierre possessed either military\r\ntalents, or even decided courage, there was nothing to have prevented\r\nhim from placing himself that very night at the head of a desperate\r\ninsurrection of the Jacobins and their followers.\r\n\r\nPayan, the successor of Hebert, actually proposed that the Jacobins\r\nshould instantly march against the two committees, which Robespierre\r\ncharged with being the focus of the anti-revolutionary machinations,\r\nsurprise their handful of guards, and stifle the evil with which the\r\nstate was menaced, even in the very cradle. This plan was deemed too\r\nhazardous to be adopted, although it was one of those sudden and master\r\nstrokes of policy which Machiavel would have recommended. The fire of\r\nthe Jacobins spent itself in tumult, and threatening, and in expelling\r\nfrom the bosom of their society Collot d'Herbois, Tallien, and about\r\nthirty other deputies of the mountain party, whom they considered as\r\nspecially leagued to effect the downfall of Robespierre, and whom they\r\ndrove from their society with execration and even blows.\r\n\r\nCollot d'Herbois, thus outraged, went straight from the meeting of the\r\nJacobins to the place where the committee of public safety was still\r\nsitting, in consultation on the report which they had to make to the\r\nconvention the next day upon the speech of Robespierre. Saint Just, one\r\nof their number, though warmly attached to the dictator, had been\r\nintrusted by the committee with the delicate task of drawing up that\r\nreport. It was a step towards reconciliation; but the entrance of Collot\r\nd'Herbois, frantic with the insults he had received, broke off all hope\r\nof accommodation betwixt the friends of Danton and those of Robespierre.\r\nD'Herbois exhausted himself in threats against Saint Just, Couthon, and\r\ntheir master, Robespierre, and they parted on terms of mortal and avowed\r\nenmity. Every exertion now was used by the associated conspirators\r\nagainst the power of Robespierre, to collect and combine against him the\r\nwhole forces of the convention, to alarm the deputies of the plain with\r\nfears for themselves, and to awaken the rage of the mountaineers,\r\nagainst whose throat the dictator now waved the sword, which their short\r\nsighted policy had placed in his hands. Lists of proscribed deputies\r\nwere handed around, said to have been copied from the tablets of the\r\ndictator; genuine or false, they obtained universal credit and currency;\r\nand these whose names stood on the fatal scrolls, engaged themselves for\r\nprotection in the league against their enemy. The opinion that his fall\r\ncould not be delayed now became general.\r\n\r\nThis sentiment was so commonly entertained in Paris on the 9th\r\nThermidor, or 27th July, that a herd of about eighty victims, who were\r\nin the act of being dragged to the guillotine, were nearly saved by\r\nmeans of it. The people, in a generous burst of compassion, began to\r\ngather in crowds, and interrupted the melancholy procession, as if the\r\npower which presided over these hideous exhibitions had already been\r\ndeprived of energy. But the hour was not come. The vile Henriot,\r\ncommandant of the national guards, came up with fresh forces also on\r\nthe day destined to be the last of his own life, proved the means of\r\ncarrying to execution this crowd of unhappy and doubtless innocent\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nOn this eventful day, Robespierre arrived in the convention, and beheld\r\nthe mountain in close array and completely manned, while, as in the case\r\nof Catiline, the bench on which he himself was accustomed to sit, seemed\r\npurposely deserted. Saint Just, Couthon, Le Bas (his brother-in-law,)\r\nand the younger Robespierre, were the only deputies of name who stood\r\nprepared to support him. But could he make an effectual struggle, he\r\nmight depend upon the aid of the servile Barrere, a sort of Belial in\r\nthe convention, the meanest, yet not the least able, amongst those\r\nfallen spirits, who, with great adroitness and ingenuity, as well as wit\r\nand eloquence, caught opportunities as they arose, and was eminently\r\ndexterous in being always strong upon the strongest, and safe upon the\r\nsafest side. There was a tolerably numerous party ready, in times so\r\ndangerous, to attach themselves to Barrere, as a leader who professed to\r\nguide them to safety if not to honour; and it was the existence of this\r\nvacillating and uncertain body, whose ultimate motions could never be\r\ncalculated upon, which rendered it impossible to presage with assurance\r\nthe event of any debate in the convention during this dangerous period.\r\n\r\nSaint Just arose, in the name of the committee of public safety, to\r\nmake, after his own manner, not theirs, a report on the discourse of\r\nRobespierre on the previous evening. He had begun a harangue in the tone\r\nof his patron, declaring that, were the tribune which he occupied the\r\nTarpeian rock itself, he would not the less, placed as he stood there,\r\ndischarge the duties of a patriot. \"I am about,\" he said, \"to lift the\r\nveil.\"--\"I tear it asunder,\" said Tallien, interrupting him. \"The public\r\ninterest is sacrificed by individuals, who come hither exclusively in\r\ntheir own name, and conduct themselves as superior to the whole\r\nconvention.\" He forced Saint Just from the tribune, and a violent debate\r\nensued.\r\n\r\nBillaud Varennes called the attention of the assembly to the sitting of\r\nthe Jacobin club on the preceding evening. He declared the military\r\nforce of Paris was placed under the command of Henriot, a traitor and a\r\nparricide, who was ready to march the soldiers whom he commanded,\r\nagainst the convention. He denounced Robespierre himself as a second\r\nCatiline, artful as well as ambitious, whose system it had been to nurse\r\njealousies and inflame dissentions in the convention, so as to disunite\r\nparties, and even individuals from each other, attack them in detail,\r\nand thus destroy those antagonists separately, upon whose combined and\r\nunited strength he dared not have looked.\r\n\r\nThe convention echoed with applause every violent expression of the\r\norator, and when Robespierre sprung to the tribune, his voice was\r\ndrowned by a general shout of \"down with the tyrant!\" Tallien moved the\r\ndenunciation of Robespierre, with the arrest of Henriot, his\r\nstaff-officers, and of others connected with the meditated violence on\r\nthe convention. He had undertaken to lead the attack upon the tyrant he\r\nsaid, and to poignard him in the convention itself, if the members did\r\nnot show courage enough to enforce the law against him. With these words\r\nhe brandished an unsheathed poignard, as if about to make his purpose\r\ngood. Robespierre still struggled hard to obtain audience, but the\r\ntribune was adjudged to Barrere; and the part taken against the fallen\r\ndictator by that versatile and self-interested statesman, was the most\r\nabsolute sign that his overthrow was irrecoverable. Torrents of\r\ninvective were now uttered from every quarter of the hall, against him\r\nwhose single word was wont to hush it into silence.\r\n\r\nThis scene was dreadful; yet not without its use to those who may be\r\ndisposed to look at it as an extraordinary crisis, in which human\r\npassions were brought so singularly into collision. While the vaults of\r\nthe hall echoed with exclamations from those who had hitherto been the\r\naccomplices, the flatterers, the followers, at least the timid and\r\noverawed assentors to the dethroned demagogue--he himself, breathless,\r\nfoaming, exhausted, like the hunter of classical antiquity when on the\r\npoint of being overpowered and torn to pieces by his own hounds, tried\r\nin vain to raise those screech-owl notes, by which the convention had\r\nformerly been terrified and put to silence. He appealed for a hearing\r\nfrom the president of the assembly, to the various parties of which it\r\nwas composed. Rejected by the mountaineers, his former associates, who\r\nnow headed the clamour against him, he applied to the Girondists, few\r\nand feeble as they were, and to the more numerous but equally helpless\r\ndeputies of the plain, with whom they sheltered. The former shook him\r\nfrom them with disgust, the last with horror. It was in vain he reminded\r\nindividuals that he had spared their lives, while at his mercy. This\r\nmight have been applied to every member in the house; to every man in\r\nFrance; for who was it during two years that had lived on other terms\r\nthan under Robespierre's permission? and deeply must he internally have\r\nregretted the clemency, as he might term it, which had left so many with\r\nungashed throats to bay at him. But his agitated and repeated appeals\r\nwere repulsed by some with indignation, by others with sullen, or\r\nembarrassed and timid silence.\r\n\r\nA British historian might say, that even Robespierre ought to have been\r\nheard in his defence; and that such calmness would have done honour to\r\nthe convention, and dignified their final sentence of condemnation. As\r\nit was, they no doubt treated the guilty individual according to his\r\ndeserts: but they fell short of that regularity and manly staidness of\r\nconduct which was due to themselves and to the law, and which would have\r\ngiven to the punishment of the demagogue the effect and weight of a\r\nsolemn and deliberate sentence, in place of its seeming the result of\r\nthe hasty and precipitate seizure of a temporary advantage.\r\n\r\nHaste was, however, necessary, and must have appeared more so at such a\r\ncrisis, than perhaps it really was. Much must be pardoned to the terrors\r\nof the moment, the horrid character of the culprit, and the necessity of\r\nhurrying to a decisive conclusion. We have been told that his last\r\naudible words, contending against the exclamations of hundreds, and the\r\nbell which the president was ringing incessantly, had uttered in the\r\nhighest tones which despair could give to a voice naturally shrill and\r\ndiscordant, dwelt long on the memory, and haunted the dreams of many who\r\nheard him:--\"President of assassins,\" he screamed, \"for the last time I\r\ndemand privilege of speech!\" After this exertion, his breath became\r\nshort and faint; and while he still uttered broken murmurs and hoarse\r\nejaculations, the members of the mountain called out, that the blood of\r\nDanton choked his voice.\r\n\r\nThe tumult was closed by a decree of arrest against Robespierre, his\r\nbrother, Couthon, and Saint Just; Le Bas was included on his own motion,\r\nand indeed could scarce have escaped the fate of his brother-in-law,\r\nthough his conduct then, and subsequently, showed more energy than that\r\nof the others. Couthon hugging in his bosom the spaniel upon which he\r\nwas wont to exhaust the overflowing of his affected sensibility,\r\nappealed to his decrepitude, and asked whether, maimed of proportion and\r\nactivity as he was, _he_ could be suspected of nourishing plans of\r\nviolence or ambition. \"Wretch,\" said Legendre, \"thou hast the strength\r\nof Hercules for the perpetration of crime.\" Dumas, president of the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal, with Henriot, commandant of the national guards,\r\nand other satellites of Robespierre, were included in the doom of\r\narrest.\r\n\r\nThe convention had declared their sitting permanent, and had taken all\r\nprecautions for appealing for protection to the large mass of citizens,\r\nwho, wearied out by the reign of terror, were desirous to close it at\r\nall hazards. They quickly had deputations from several of the\r\nneighbouring sections, declaring their adherence to the national\r\nrepresentatives, in whose defence they were arming, and (many\r\nundoubtedly prepared beforehand) were marching in all haste to the\r\nprotection of the convention. But they heard also the less pleasing\r\ntidings, that Henriot, having effected the dispersion of those citizens\r\nwho had obstructed, as elsewhere mentioned, the execution of the eighty\r\ncondemned persons, and consummated that final act of murder, was\r\napproaching the Tuilleries, where they had held their sitting, with a\r\nnumerous staff, and such of the Jacobinical forces as could hastily be\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nHappily for the convention, this commandant of the national guards, on\r\nwhose presence of mind and courage the fate of France perhaps for the\r\nmoment depended, was as stupid and cowardly as he was brutally\r\nferocious. He suffered himself without resistance, to be arrested by a\r\nfew gens d'armes, the immediate guards of the convention, headed by two\r\nof its members, who behaved in the emergency with equal prudence and\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nBut fortune, or the demon whom he had served, afforded Robespierre\r\nanother chance for safety, perhaps even for empire; for moments which a\r\nman of self-possession might have employed for escape, one of desperate\r\ncourage might have used for victory, which, considering the divided and\r\nextremely unsettled state of the capital, was likely to be gained by the\r\nboldest competitor.\r\n\r\nThe arrested deputies had been carried from one prison to another, all\r\nthe jailers refusing to receive under their official charge\r\nRobespierre, and those who had aided him in supplying their dark\r\nhabitations with such a tide of successive inhabitants. At length the\r\nprisoners were secured in the office of the committee of public safety.\r\nBut by this time all was in alarm amongst the commune of Paris, where\r\nFleuriot the mayor, and Payan the successor of Hebert, convoked the\r\ncivic body, despatched municipal officers to raise the city and the\r\nFauxbourgs in their name, and caused the tocsin to be rung. Payan\r\nspeedily assembled a force sufficient to liberate Henriot, Robespierre,\r\nand the other arrested deputies, and to carry them to the Hotel de\r\nVille, where about two thousand men were congregated, consisting chiefly\r\nof artillerymen, and of insurgents from the suburb of Saint Antoine, who\r\nalready expressed their resolution of marching against the convention.\r\nBut the selfish and cowardly character of Robespierre was unfit for such\r\na crisis. He appeared altogether confounded and overwhelmed with what\r\nhad passed and was passing around him; and not one of all the victims of\r\nthe reign of terror felt its disabling influence so completely as he,\r\nthe despot who had so long directed its sway. He had not, even though\r\nthe means must have been in his power, the presence of mind to disperse\r\nmoney in considerable sums, which of itself would not have failed to\r\ninsure the support of the revolutionary rabble.\r\n\r\nMeantime the convention continued to maintain the bold and commanding\r\nfront which they had so suddenly and critically assumed. Upon learning\r\nthe escape of the arrested deputies, and hearing of the insurrection at\r\nthe Hotel de Ville, they instantly passed a decree outlawing Robespierre\r\nand his associates, inflicting a similar doom upon the mayor of Paris,\r\nthe procureur, and other members of the commune, and charging twelve of\r\ntheir members, the boldest that could be selected, to proceed with the\r\narmed force to the execution of the sentence. The drums of the national\r\nguards now beat to arms in all the sections under authority of the\r\nconvention, while the tocsin continued to summon assistance with its\r\niron voice to Robespierre and the civic magistrates. Every thing\r\nappeared to threaten a violent catastrophe, until it was seen clearly\r\nthat the public voice, and especially amongst the national guards, was\r\ndeclaring itself generally against the terrorists.\r\n\r\nThe Hotel de Ville was surrounded by about fifteen hundred men, and\r\ncannon turned upon the doors. The force of the assailants was weakest in\r\npoint of number, but their leaders were men of spirit, and night\r\nconcealed their inferiority of force.\r\n\r\nThe deputies commissioned for the purpose read the decree of the\r\nassembly to those whom they found assembled in front of the city hall,\r\nand they shrunk from the attempt of defending it, some joining the\r\nassailants, others laying down their arms and dispersing. Meantime the\r\ndeserted group of terrorists within conducted themselves like scorpions,\r\nwhich, when surrounded by a circle of fire, are said to turn their\r\nstings on each other, and on themselves. Mutual and ferocious upbraiding\r\ntook place among these miserable men. \"Wretch, were these the means you\r\npromised to furnish?\" said Payan to Henriot, whom he found intoxicated\r\nand incapable of resolution or exertion; and seizing on him as he spoke,\r\nhe precipitated the revolutionary general from a window. Henriot\r\nsurvived the fall only to drag himself into a drain, in which he was\r\nafterwards discovered and brought out to execution. The younger\r\nRobespierre threw himself from the window, but had not the good fortune\r\nto perish on the spot. It seemed as if even the melancholy fate of\r\nsuicide, the last refuge of guilt and despair, was denied to men who had\r\nso long refused every species of mercy to their fellow-creatures. Le Bas\r\nalone had calmness enough to despatch himself with a pistol shot. Saint\r\nJust, after imploring his comrades to kill him, attempted his own life\r\nwith an irresolute hand, and failed. Couthon lay beneath the table\r\nbrandishing a knife, with which he repeatedly wounded his bosom, without\r\ndaring to add force enough to reach his heart. Their chief, Robespierre,\r\nin an unsuccessful attempt to shoot himself, had only inflicted a\r\nhorrible fracture on his under-jaw.\r\n\r\nIn this situation they were found like wolves in their lair, foul with\r\nblood, mutilated, despairing, and yet not able to die. Robespierre lay\r\non a table in an anti-room, his head supported by a deal box, and his\r\nhideous countenance half hidden by a bloody and dirty cloth bound round\r\nthe shattered chin.\r\n\r\nThe captives were carried in triumph to the convention, who, without\r\nadmitting them to the bar, ordered them, as outlaws, for instant\r\nexecution. As the fatal cars passed to the guillotine, those who filled\r\nthem, but especially Robespierre, were overwhelmed with execrations from\r\nthe friends and relatives of victims whom he had sent on the same\r\nmelancholy road. The nature of his previous wound, from which the cloth\r\nhad never been removed till the executioner tore it off, added to the\r\ntorture of the sufferer. The shattered jaw dropped, and the wretch\r\nyelled aloud to the horror of the spectators. A masque taken from that\r\ndreadful head was long exhibited in different nations of Europe, and\r\nappalled the spectator by its ugliness, and the mixture of fiendish\r\nexpression with that of bodily agony.\r\n\r\nThus fell Maximilian Robespierre, after having been the first person in\r\nthe French republic for nearly two years, during which time he governed\r\nit upon the principles of Nero or Caligula. His elevation to the\r\nsituation which he held, involved more contradictions than perhaps\r\nattach to any similar event in history. A low-born and low-minded tyrant\r\nwas permitted to rule with the rod of the most frightful despotism a\r\npeople, whose anxiety for liberty had shortly before rendered them\r\nunable to endure the rule of a humane and lawful sovereign. A dastardly\r\ncoward arose to the command of one of the bravest nations in the world;\r\nand it was under the auspices of a man who dared scarce fire a pistol,\r\nthat the greatest generals in France began their careers of conquest. He\r\nhad neither eloquence nor imagination; but substituted in their stead a\r\nmiserable, affected, bombastic style, which, until other circumstances\r\ngave him consequence, drew on him general ridicule. Yet against so poor\r\nan orator, all the eloquence of the philosophical Girondists, all the\r\nterrible powers of his associate Danton, employed in a popular\r\nassembly, could not enable them to make an effectual resistance. It may\r\nseem trifling to mention, that in a nation where a good deal of\r\nprepossession is excited by amiable manners and beauty of external\r\nappearance, the person who ascended to the highest power was not only\r\nill-looking, but singularly mean in person, awkward and constrained in\r\nhis address, ignorant how to set about pleasing even when he most\r\ndesired to give pleasure, and as tiresome nearly as he was odious and\r\nheartless.\r\n\r\nTo compensate all these deficiencies, Robespierre had but an insatiable\r\nambition, founded on a vanity which made him think himself capable of\r\nfilling the highest situation; and therefore gave him daring, when to\r\ndare is frequently to achieve. He mixed a false and overstrained, but\r\nrather fluent species of bombastic composition, with the grossest\r\nflattery to the lowest classes of the people; in consideration of which,\r\nthey could not but receive as genuine the praises which he always\r\nbestowed on himself. His prudent resolution to be satisfied with\r\npossessing the essence of power, without seeming to desire its rank and\r\ntrappings, formed another art of cajoling the multitude. His watchful\r\nenvy, his long-protracted but sure revenge, his craft, which to vulgar\r\nminds supplies the place of wisdom, were his only means of competing\r\nwith his distinguished antagonists. And it seems to have been a merited\r\npunishment of the extravagances and abuses of the French revolution,\r\nthat it engaged the country in a state of anarchy which permitted a\r\nwretch such as we have described, to be for a long period master of her\r\ndestiny. Blood was his element, like that of the other terrorists and he\r\nnever fastened with so much pleasure on a new victim; as when he was at\r\nthe same time an ancient associate. In an epitaph, of which the\r\nfollowing couplet may serve as a translation, his life was represented\r\nas incompatible with the existence of the human race:--\r\n\r\n        \"Here lies Robespierre--let no tear be shed:\r\n        Reader, if he had lived, thou hadst been dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe fall of Robespierre ended the \"_Reign of Terror_.\" Most of the\r\nleaders who had acted a conspicuous part in these horrid scenes, met a\r\ndoom similar to that of their leaders. It is impossible to convey to the\r\nreader any adequate conception of the atrocities committed in France\r\nduring this gloomy period, in the name of liberty. Men, women, and\r\nchildren were involved in the massacres which took place at the\r\ninstigation of the Jacobin chiefs. Hundreds of both sexes were thrown\r\ninto the Loire, and this was called republican marriage and republican\r\nbaptism. And it should never be forgotten, that it was not till France\r\nas a nation, had denied the existence of a Deity, and the validity of\r\nhis institutions, that she was visited by such terrible calamities. Let\r\nit be \"burnt in on the memory\" of every generation, that such is the\r\nlegitimate tendency of infidel opinions. They first destroy the\r\nconscience--blunt the moral sense--harden the heart, and wither up all\r\nthe social and kindly affections, and then their votaries are ripe for\r\nany deed of wickedness within the possibility of accomplishment by human\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nSays an eloquent writer--\"When the Sabbath was abolished in France, the\r\nMighty God whose being they had denied, and whose worship they\r\nabolished, stood aloof and gave them up,--and a scene of proscription,\r\nand assassination, and desolation, ensued, unparalleled in the annals of\r\nthe civilized world. In the city of Paris, there were in 1803, eight\r\nhundred and seven suicides and murders. Among the criminals executed,\r\nthere were seven fathers who had poisoned their children, ten husbands\r\nwho had murdered their wives, six wives who had poisoned their husbands,\r\nand fifteen children who had destroyed their parents.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be profitable here to record the end of several other Jacobin\r\nleaders who had been conspicuous during these scenes of atrocity and\r\nbloodshed. Public opinion demanded that some of the most obnoxious\r\nmembers should be condemned. After hesitating for some time, at length\r\nthe convention, pressed by shame on the one side and fear on the other,\r\nsaw the necessity of some active measure, and appointed a commission to\r\nconsider and report upon the conduct of the four most obnoxious Jacobin\r\nchiefs, Collot d'Herbois, Billaud Varennes, Vadier, and Barrere. The\r\nreport was of course unfavourable; yet upon the case being considered,\r\nthe convention were satisfied to condemn them to transportation to\r\nCayenne. Some resistance was offered to this sentence, so mild in\r\nproportion to what those who underwent it had been in the habit of\r\ninflicting; but it was borne down, and the sentence was carried into\r\nexecution. Collot d'Herbois, the demolisher and depopulator of Lyons, is\r\nsaid to have died in the common hospital, in consequence of drinking off\r\nat once a whole bottle of ardent spirits. Billaud Varennes spent his\r\ntime in teaching the innocent parrots of Guiana the frightful jargon of\r\nthe revolutionary committee; and finally perished in misery.\r\n\r\nThese men both belonged to that class of atheists, who, looking up\r\ntowards heaven, loudly and literally defied the Deity to make his\r\nexistence known by launching his thunderbolts. Miracles are not wrought\r\non the challenge of a blasphemer more than on the demand of a sceptic;\r\nbut both these unhappy men had probably before their death reason to\r\nconfess, that in abandoning the wicked to their own free will, a greater\r\npenalty results even in this life, than if Providence had been pleased\r\nto inflict the immediate doom which they had impiously defied.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the success of this decisive measure, the government\r\nproceeded against some of the terrorists whom they had hitherto spared,\r\nbut whose fate was now determined, in order to strike dismay into their\r\nparty. Six Jacobins, accounted among the most ferocious of the class,\r\nwere arrested and delivered up to be tried by a military commission.\r\nThey were all deputies of the mountain gang. Certain of their doom, they\r\nadopted a desperate resolution. Among the whole party, they possessed\r\nbut one knife, but they resolved it should serve them all for the\r\npurpose of suicide. The instant their sentence was pronounced, one\r\nstabbed himself with this weapon; another snatched the knife from his\r\ncompanion's dying hand, plunged it in his own bosom, and handed it to\r\nthe third, who imitated the dreadful example. Such was the consternation\r\nof the attendants, that no one arrested the fatal progress of the\r\nweapon--all fell either dead or desperately wounded--the last were\r\ndespatched by the guillotine.\r\n\r\nAfter this decisive victory, and last dreadful catastrophe, Jacobinism,\r\nconsidered as a pure and unmixed party, can scarce be said to have again\r\nraised its head in France, although its leaven has gone to qualify and\r\ncharacterize, in some degree, more than one of the different parties\r\nwhich have succeeded them. As a political sect, the Jacobins can be\r\ncompared to none that ever existed, for none but themselves ever thought\r\nof an organized, regular, and continued system of murdering and\r\nplundering the rich, that they might debauch the poor by the\r\ndistribution of their spoils. They bear, however, some resemblance to\r\nthe frantic followers of John of Leyden and Knipperdoling, who occupied\r\nMunster in the seventeenth century, and committed, in the name of\r\nreligion, the same frantic horrors which the French Jacobins did in that\r\nof freedom. In both cases, the courses adopted by these parties were\r\nmost foreign to, and inconsistent with, the alleged motives of their\r\nconduct. The Anabaptists practised every species of vice and cruelty, by\r\nthe dictates, they said, of inspiration--the Jacobins imprisoned three\r\nhundred thousand of their countrymen in the name of liberty, and put to\r\ndeath more than half the number, under the sanction of fraternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nObvious punctuation errors repaired except where noted below.\r\n\r\nPage vi, \"Vallie's\" changed to \"valleys\" (the valleys of Piedmont)\r\n\r\nPage vii, \"stupifies\" changed to \"stupefies (first stupefies the)\r\n\r\nPage xi, \"Hawkes\" changed to \"Haukes\" (Ardeley, Haukes, and)\r\n\r\nPage 18, \"Icunum\" changed to \"Iconium\" (Jerusalem, Iconium, Lystra)\r\n\r\nPage 23, \"northen\" changed to \"northern\" (restless northern nations)\r\n\r\nPage 26, \"catechhmun\" changed to \"catechumen\" (catechumen of Carthage)\r\n\r\nPage 33, \"i ine\" changed to \"in fine\" (in fine, he was)\r\n\r\nPage 39, \"batoons\" changed to \"batons\" (with batons, and)\r\n\r\nPage 42, \"martrydom\" changed to \"martyrdom\" (conclusion of her\r\nmartyrdom)\r\n\r\nPage 51, \"dioceas\" changed to \"diocese\" (in the diocese)\r\n\r\nPage 51, \"remand\" changed to \"remanded\" (They remanded him)\r\n\r\nPage 60, \"cardina\" changed to \"cardinal\" (crowns of the cardinal)\r\n\r\nPage 64, \"no\" changed to \"not\" (reached not to)\r\n\r\nPage 73, \"nflicted\" changed to \"inflicted\" (inflicted twice without)\r\n\r\nPage 73, \"quiety\" changed to \"quietly\" (peaceably and quietly)\r\n\r\nPage 73, \"hreatening\" changed to \"threatening\" (threatening words to)\r\n\r\nPage 75, \"erwise\" changed to \"otherwise\" (far otherwise than)\r\n\r\nPage 77, \"contributious\" changed to \"contributions\" (last contributions\r\nto)\r\n\r\nPage 77, word \"a\" was inferred and placed in text do to spacing and\r\ncontext (such a procedure)\r\n\r\nPage 80, inconsistent quotation marks were retained as original intent\r\ncould not be assertained.\r\n\r\nPage 91, \"iner\" changed to \"Gardiner\" (Gardiner was drawn)\r\n\r\nPage 91, \"ne\" changed to \"near\" (near the fire)\r\n\r\nPage 125, \"Vilaro\" changed to \"Villaro\" (of Villaro and Bobbio)\r\n\r\nPage 126, \"apprended\" changed to \"apprehended\" (Michialm, was\r\napprehended)\r\n\r\nPage 132, \"dorpped\" changed to \"dropped\" (till they dropped)\r\n\r\nPage 134, \"stil kep\" changed to \"still kept\" (and still kept)\r\n\r\nPage 136, \"s\" changed to \"his\" (completed his regiment)\r\n\r\nPage 136, \"retron\" changed to \"return\" (and return thanks)\r\n\r\nPage 137, \"Vilaro\" changed to \"Villaro\" (rocks of Villaro)\r\n\r\nPage 137, word \"to\" inserted into text (put to death)\r\n\r\nPage 138, \"that\" changed to \"than\" (than their suffering)\r\n\r\nPage 158, \"tr s\" changed to \"troops\" (of his troops)\r\n\r\nPage 158, \"un ook\" changed to \"undertook\" (princes undertook the)\r\n\r\nPage 158, \"wel\" changed to \"well\" (were all well)\r\n\r\nPage 159, \"w s\" changed to \"was\" (Zisca was solicited)\r\n\r\nPage 175, \"possesion\" changed to \"possession\" (his possession.)\r\n\r\nPage 179, \"ban- s hour\" changed to \"banish our\" (banish our preachers)\r\n\r\nPage 180, \"enj ned\" changed to \"enjoined\" (strictly enjoined his)\r\n\r\nPage 204, \"see\" changed to \"she\" (whom she forgave)\r\n\r\nPage 206, \"queen\" changed to \"Queen\" (in Queen Mary's)\r\n\r\nPage 207, \"Northhampton\" changed to \"Northampton\" (preached at\r\nNorthampton)\r\n\r\nPage 214, \"halbered\" changed to \"halberd\" (halberd struck him)\r\n\r\nPage 222, \"Osmand\" changed to \"Osmond\" (Thomas Watts, Thomas Osmond)\r\n\r\nPage 223, \"Was\" changed to \"was\" (he was brought)\r\n\r\nPage 224, \"sherif\" changed to \"sheriff\" (of the sheriff)\r\n\r\nPage 232, \"passsed\" changed to \"passed\" (he passed Bocardo)\r\n\r\nPage 232, word \"be\" deleted from text.
