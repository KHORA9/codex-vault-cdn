The\r\ngeneral arrangement of the book remains unchanged, but a certain\r\nnumber of statements have been modified, corrected, or suppressed.\r\nThe study of our surnames has been mostly left to the amateur\r\nphilologist, and many origins given by my predecessors as ascertained\r\nfacts turn out, on investigation, to be unsupported by a shred of\r\nevidence.  I cannot hope that this little book in its new form is free\r\nfrom error, but I feel that it has benefited by the years I have spent\r\nin research since its original publication.  I would ask reader to\r\naccept it, not as a comprehensive treatise containing full information\r\non any name that happens to occur in it, but as a general survey of\r\nthe subject, and an attempt to indicate and exemplify the various ways\r\nin which our surnames have come into existence.\r\n\r\nERNEST WEEKLEY.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY COLLEGE, NOTTINGHAM.  April 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\nThe early demand for a new edition of this little book is a gratifying\r\nproof of a widespread interest in its subject, rather than a testimony\r\nto the value of my small contribution to that subject.  Of the\r\nimperfections of this contribution no one can be more conscious than\r\nmyself, but I trust that the most palpable blemishes have been removed\r\nin this revised edition.  The student of etymology seldom passes a day\r\nwithout coming across some piece of evidence which throws new light on\r\na difficult problem (see Chapter XVI), or invalidates what had before\r\nseemed a reasonable conjecture.  I have to thank many correspondents\r\nfor sending me information of value and for indicating points in which\r\nconciseness has led to misunderstanding.  Some of my correspondents\r\nneed, however, to be reminded that etymology and genealogy are\r\nseparate sciences; so that, while offering every apology to that Mr.\r\nRobinson whose name is a corruption of Montmorency, I still adhere to\r\nmy belief that the other Robinsons derive from Robert.\r\n\r\nERNEST WEEKLEY.\r\n\r\nNOTTINGHAM    March 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of personal names has always had an attraction for\r\nthe learned and others, but the first attempts to classify and explain\r\nour English surnames date, so far as my knowledge goes, from 1605.  In\r\nthat year Verstegan published his Restitution of Decayed Intelligence,\r\nwhich contains chapters on both font-names and surnames, and about the\r\nsame time appeared Camden's Remains Concerning Britain, in which the\r\nsame subjects are treated much more fully.  Both of these learned\r\nantiquaries make excellent reading, and much curious information may\r\nbe gleaned from their pages, especially those of Camden, whose\r\nposition as Clarencieux King-at-Arms gave him exceptional\r\nopportunities for genealogical research.  From the philological point\r\nof view they are of course untrustworthy, though less so than most\r\nmodern writers on the same subject.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the nineteenth century, the period of Archbishop\r\nTrench and Canon Taylor, began a kind of boom in works of this kind,\r\nand books on surnames are now numerous.  But of all these industrious\r\ncompilers one only, Bardsley, can be taken seriously.  His Dictionary\r\nof English Surnames, published (Oxford Press, 1901) from his notes\r\nsome years after his death, is invaluable to students.  It represents\r\nthe results of twenty years' conscientious research among early rolls\r\nand registers, the explanations given being usually supported by\r\nmedieval instances.  But it cannot be used uncritically, for the\r\nauthor does not appear to have been either a linguist or a\r\nphilologist, and, although he usually refrains from etymological\r\nconjecture, he occasionally ventures with disastrous results.  Thus,\r\nto take a few instances, he identifies Prust with Priest, but the\r\nmedieval le prust is quite obviously the Norman form of Old Fr. le\r\nProust, the provost.  He attempts to connect pullen with the archaic\r\nEng. pullen, poultry; but his early examples, le pulein, polayn, etc.,\r\nare of course Fr. Poulain, i.e. Colt.  Under Fallows, explained as\r\n\"fallow lands,\" he quotes three examples of de la faleyse, i.e. Fr.\r\nFalaise, corresponding to our Cliff, Cleeve, etc; Pochin, explained as\r\nthe diminutive of some personal name, is the Norman form of the famous\r\nname Poussin, i.e. Chick.  Or, coming to native instances, le wenchel,\r\na medieval prototype of Winkle, is explained as for \"periwinkle,\"\r\nwhereas it is a common Middle-English word, existing now in the\r\nshortened form wench, and means Child.  The obsolete Swordslipper, now\r\nonly Slipper, which he interprets as a maker of \"sword-slips,\" or\r\nsheaths, was really a sword-sharpener, from Mid. Eng. slipen, cognate\r\nwith Old Du. slijpen, to polish, sharpen, and Ger. schleifen.\r\nSometimes a very simple problem is left unexplained, e.g. in the case\r\nof the name Tyas, where the medieval instances of le tyeis are to a\r\nstudent of Old French clearly le tieis or tiois, i.e. the German,\r\ncognate with Ger. deutsch and Ital. tedesco.\r\n\r\nThese examples are quoted, not in depreciation of conscientious\r\nstudent to whose work my own compilation is greatly indebted, but\r\nmerely to show that the etymological study of surnames has scarcely\r\nbeen touched at present, except by writers to whom philology is an\r\nunknown science.  I have inserted, as a specimen problem (ch.  xvi.),\r\na little disquisition on the name Rutter, a cursory perusal of which\r\nwill convince most readers that it is not much use making shots in\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nMy aim has been to steer a clear course between a too learned and a\r\ntoo superficial treatment, and rather to show how surnames are formed\r\nthan to adduce innumerable examples which the reader should be able to\r\nsolve for himself.  I have made no attempt to collect curious names,\r\nbut have taken those which occur in the London Directory (1908) or\r\nhave caught my eye in the newspaper or the streets.  To go into proofs\r\nwould have swelled the book beyond all reasonable proportions, but the\r\nreader may assume that, in the case of any derivation not expressly\r\nstated as a conjecture, the connecting links exist.  In the various\r\nclasses of names, I have intentionally omitted all that is obvious,\r\nexcept in the rather frequent case of the obvious being wrong.  The\r\nindex, which I have tried to make complete, is intended to replace to\r\nsome extent those cross-references which are useful to students but\r\nirritating to the general reader.  Hundreds of names are susceptible\r\nof two, three, or more explanations, and I do not profess to be\r\nexhaustive.\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter is divided into a number of rather short chapters,\r\ndealing with the various classes and subdivisions into which surnames\r\nfall; but the natural association which exists between names has often\r\nprevailed over rigid classification.  The quotations by which obsolete\r\nwords are illustrated are taken as far as possible from Chaucer, whose\r\nwritings date from the very period when our surnames were gradually\r\nbecoming hereditary.  I have also quoted extensively from the\r\nPromptorium Parvulorum, our earliest English-Latin Dictionary (1440).\r\n\r\nIn ch. vii, on Anglo-Saxon names, I have obtained some help from a\r\npaper by the late Professor Skeat (Transactions of the Philological\r\nSociety, 1907-10, pp. 57-85) and from the materials contained in\r\nSearle's valuable Onomasticon Anglo-Saxonicum (Cambridge, 1897).\r\nAmong several works which I have consulted on French and German family\r\nnames, the most useful have been Heintze's Deutsche Familiennamen, 3rd\r\ned.  (Halle a.  S., 1908) and Kremers' Beitraege zur Erforschung der\r\nfranzoesischen Familiennamen (Bonn, 1910).  The comparative method\r\nwhich I have adopted, especially in explaining nicknames (ch.  xxi),\r\nwill be found, I think, to clear up a good many dark points.  Of books\r\non names published in this country, only Bardsley's Dictionary has\r\nbeen of any considerable assistance, though I have gleaned some scraps\r\nof information here and there from other compilations.  My real\r\nsources have been the lists of medieval names found in Domesday Book,\r\nthe Pipe Rolls, the Hundred Rolls, and in the numerous historical\r\nrecords published by the Government and by various antiquarian\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nERNEST WEEKLEY.\r\n\r\nNottingham, September 1913\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following dictionaries are quoted without further reference:\r\n\r\nPromptorium Parvulorum (1440), ed.  Mayhew (E.E.T.S.; 1908).\r\n\r\nPALSGRAVE, L'Esclarcissement de la langue francoyse (1530), ed.

OF SURNAMES IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n\"The French and we termed them Surnames, not because they are the\r\nnames of the Sire, or the father, but because they are super-added to\r\nChristian names.\"\r\n\r\n(CAMDEN, Remains concerning Britain.)\r\n\r\nThe study of the origin of family names is at the same time quite\r\nsimple and very difficult.  Its simplicity consists in the fact that\r\nsurnames can only come into existence in certain well-understood ways.\r\nIts difficulty is due to the extraordinary perversions which names\r\nundergo in common speech, to the orthographic uncertainty of our\r\nancestors, to the frequent coalescence of two or more names of quite\r\ndifferent Origin, and to the multitudinous forms which one single name\r\ncan assume, such forms being due to local pronunciation, accidents of\r\nspelling, date of adoption, and many minor causes.  It must always\r\nremembered that the majority of our surnames from the various dialects\r\nof Middle English, i.e. of a language very different from our own in\r\nspelling and sound, full of words that are now obsolete, and of others\r\nwhich have completely changed their form and meaning.\r\n\r\nIf we take any medieval roll of names, we see almost at a glance that\r\nfour such individuals as--\r\n\r\nJohn filius Simon\r\n\r\nWilliam de la Moor\r\n\r\nRichard le Spicer\r\n\r\nRobert le Long\r\n\r\nexhaust the possibilities of English name-making--i.e. that every\r\nsurname must be (i) personal, from a sire or ancestor, (ii) local,\r\nfrom place of residence, [Footnote: This is by far the largest class,\r\ncounting by names, not individuals, and many names for which I give\r\nanother explanation have also a local origin.  Thus, when I say that\r\nEly is Old Fr. Élie, i.e. Elias, I assume that the reader will know\r\nwithout being told that it has an alternative explanation from Ely in\r\nCambridgeshire.]  (iii) occupative, from trade or office, (iv) a\r\nnickname, from bodily attributes, character, etc.\r\n\r\nThis can easily be illustrated from any list of names taken at random.\r\nThe Rugby team chosen to represent the East Midlands against Kent\r\n(January 22, 1913) consisted of the following fifteen names: Hancock;\r\nMobbs, Poulton, Hudson, Cook; Watson, Earl; Bull, Muddiman, Collins,\r\nTebbitt, Lacey, Hall, Osborne, Manton.  Some of these are simple, but\r\nothers require a little knowledge for their explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL NAMES\r\n\r\nThere are seven personal names, and the first of these, Hancock, is\r\nrather a problem.  This is usually explained as from Flemish Hanke,\r\nJohnny, while the origin of the suffix -cock has never been very\r\nclearly accounted for (see The suffix -cock, Chapter VI).  With\r\nHancock we may compare Hankin.  But, while the Flemish derivation is\r\npossible for these two names, it will not explain Hanson, which\r\nsometimes becomes Hansom (Epithesis And Assimilation, Chapter III).\r\nAccording to Camden, there is evidence that Han was also used as a\r\nrimed form of Ran, short for Ranolf and Randolf (cf. Hob from Robert,\r\nHick from Richard), very popular names in the north during the surname\r\nperiod.  In Hankin and Hancock this Han would naturally coalesce with\r\nthe Flemish Hanke.  This would also explain the names Hand for Rand,\r\nand Hands, Hance for Rands, Rance.  Mobbs is the same as Mabbs (cf.\r\nMoggy for Maggy), and Mabbs is the genitive of Mab, i.e. Mabel, for\r\nAmabel.  We have the diminutive in Mappin and the patronymic in\r\nMapleson.  [Footnote: Maple and Mapple, generally tree names (Chapter\r\nXII), are in some cases for Mabel.  Maplethorpe is from Mablethorpe\r\n(Line.), thorp of Madalbert (Maethelbeorht).]  Hudson is the son of\r\nHud, a very common medieval name, which seems to represent Anglo-Saxon\r\nHudda (Chapter VII), the vigorous survival of which into the surname\r\nperiod is a mystery.  Watson is the son of Wat, i.e. Walter, from the\r\nOld N.E. Fr. Vautier (Gautier), regularly pronounced and written Water\r\nat one time--\r\n\r\n\". . . My name is Walter Whitmore.\r\nHow now!  Why start'st thou?  What!  doth death affright?\r\n\r\nSuffolk.          Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.\r\nA cunning man did calculate my birth,\r\nAnd told me that by water I should die.\"\r\n\r\n(2 Henry VI, iv.1)\r\n\r\nHence the name Waters, which has not usually any connection with\r\nwater; while Waterman, though sometimes occupative, is also formed\r\nfrom Walter, like Hickman from Hick (Chapter VI).  Collins is from\r\nColin, a French diminutive of Col, i.e. Nicol or Nicolas.\r\n\r\nTebbitt is a diminutive of Theobald, a favourite medieval name which\r\nhad the shortened forms Teb, Tib, Tub, whence a number of derivatives.\r\nBut names in Teb- and Tib- may also come from Isabel  (Chapter X).\r\nOsborne is the Anglo-Saxon name Osbeorn.\r\n\r\nOf course, each of these personal names has a meaning, e.g. Amabel,\r\nultimately Latin, means lovable, and Walter, a Germanic name, means\r\n\"rule army\" (Modern Ger. walten and Heer), but the discussion of such\r\nmeanings lies outside our subject.  It is, in fact, sometimes\r\ndifficult to distinguish between the personal name and the nickname.\r\nThus Pagan, whence Payn, with its diminutives Pannell, Pennell, etc.,\r\nGold, Good, German, whence Jermyn, Jarman, and many other apparent\r\nnicknames, occur as personal names in the earliest records.  Their\r\netymological origin is in any case the same as if they were nicknames.\r\n\r\nTo return to our football team, Poulton, Lacey, Hall, and Manton are\r\nlocal.  There are several villages in Cheshire and Lancashire named\r\nPoulton, i.e. the town or homestead (Chapter XIII) by the pool.  Lacey\r\noccurs in Domesday Book as de Laci, from some small spot in Normandy,\r\nprobably the hamlet of Lassy (Calvados).  Hall is due to residence\r\nnear the great house of the neighbourhood.  If Hall's ancestor's name\r\nhad chanced to be put down in Anglo-French as de la sale, he might now\r\nbe known as Sale, or even as Saul.  Manton is the name of places in\r\nLincolnshire and Northamptonshire, so that this player, at any rate,\r\nhas an ancestral qualification for the East Midlands.\r\n\r\nThe only true occupative name in the list is Cook, for Earl is a\r\nnickname.  Cook was perhaps the last occupative title to hold its own\r\nagainst the inherited name.  Justice Shallow, welcoming Sir John\r\nFalstaff, says--\r\n\r\n\"Some pigeons, Davy; a couple of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton,\r\nand any pretty little tiny kickshaws.  Tell William Cook\" (2 Henry IV, v.\r\ni.).\r\n\r\nAnd students of the Ingoldsby Legends will remember that\r\n\r\n\"Ellen Bean ruled his cuisine.--He called her Nelly Cook.\"\r\n\r\n(Nell Cook, 1.  32.)\r\n\r\nThere are probably a goodly number of housewives of the present day\r\nwho would be at a loss if suddenly asked for \"cook's\" name in full.\r\nIt may be noted that Lequeux means exactly the same, and is of\r\nidentical origin, archaic Fr. le queux, Lat. coquus, while Kew is\r\nsometimes for Anglo-Fr. le keu, where keu is the accusative of queux\r\n(Alternative Origins, Chapter I).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNICKNAMES\r\n\r\nThe nicknames are Earl, Bull, and Muddiman.  Nicknames such as Earl\r\nmay have been acquired in various ways (Chapter XV).  Bull and\r\nMuddiman are singularly appropriate for Rugby scrummagers, though the\r\nfirst may be from an inn or shop sign, rather than from physique or\r\ncharacter.  It is equivalent to Thoreau, Old Fr. toreau (taureau).\r\nMuddiman is for Moodyman, where moody has its older meaning of\r\nvaliant; cf. its German cognate mutig.  The weather on the day in\r\nquestion gave a certain fitness both to the original meaning and the\r\nlater form.\r\n\r\nThe above names are, with the exception of Hancock, Hudson, and\r\nMuddiman, easy to solve; but it must not be concluded that every list\r\nis as simple, or that the obvious is always right.  The first page of\r\nBards Dictionary of Surnames might well serve as a danger-signal to\r\ncocksure writers on this subject.  The names Abbey and Abbott would\r\nnaturally seem to go back to an ancestor who lived in or near an and\r\nto another who had been nicknamed the abbot.\r\n\r\nBut Abbey is more often from the Anglo-French entry le abbé, the\r\nabbot, and Abbott may be a diminutive of Ab, standing for Abel, or\r\nAbraham, the first of which was a common medieval font-name.  Francis\r\nHolyoak describes himself on the title-page of his Latin Dictionary\r\n(1612) as Franciscus de Sacra Quercu, but his name also represents the\r\nholly oak, or holm oak (Tree Names, Chapter XII).  On the other hand,\r\nHolliman always occurs in early rolls as hali or holi man, i.e. holy\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYTHICAL ETYMOLOGIES\r\n\r\nIt may be stated here, once for all, that etymologies of names which\r\nare based on medieval latinizations, family mottoes, etc., are always\r\nto be regarded with suspicion, as they involve the reversing of\r\nchronology, or the explanation of a name by a pun which has been made\r\nfrom it.  We find Lilburne latinized as de insula tontis, as though it\r\nwere the impossible hybrid de l'isle burn, and Beautoy sometimes as de\r\nbella fide, whereas foy is the Old French for beech, from Lat. fagus.\r\nNapier of Merchiston had the motto n'a pier, \"has no equal,\" and\r\ndescribed himself on title-pages as the Nonpareil, but his ancestor\r\nwas a servant who looked after the napery.  With Holyoak's rendering\r\nof his own name we may compare Parkinson's \"latinization\" of his name\r\nin his famous book on gardening(1629), which bears the title Paradisi\r\nin Sole Paradisus Terrestris, i.e. the Earthly Paradise of \"Park in\r\nSun.\"\r\n\r\nMany noble names have an anecdotic \"explanation.\"  I learnt at school\r\nthat Percy came from \"pierce-eye,\" in allusion to a treacherous\r\nexploit at Alnwick.  The Lesleys claim descent from a hero who\r\noverthrew a Hungarian champion\r\n\r\n\"Between the less lee and the Mair\r\n He slew the knight and left him there.\"\r\n\r\n(Quentin Durward, ch. xxxvii.)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the great name of Courtenay, Courtney, of French local\r\norigin, is derived in an Old French epic from court nez, short nose,\r\nan epithet conferred on the famous Guillaume d'Orange, who, when the\r\nsword of a Saracen giant removed this important feature, exclaimed\r\nundauntedly--\r\n\r\n\"Mais que mon nés ai un poi acorcié,\r\nBien sai mes nons en sera alongié.\"\r\n\r\n(Li Coronemenz Looïs, 1.  1159.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote: \"Though I have my nose a little shortened, I know well that\r\nmy name will be thereby lengthened.\"]\r\n\r\nI read lately in some newspaper that the original Lockhart took the\r\n\"heart\" of the Bruce to the Holy Land in a \"locked\" casket.\r\nPractically every famous Scottish name has a yarn connected with it,\r\nthe gem perhaps being that which accounts for Guthrie.  A Scottish\r\nking, it is said, landed weary and hungry as the sole survivor of a\r\nshipwreck.  He approached a woman who was gutting fish, and asked her\r\nto prepare one for him.  The kindly fishwife at once replied, \"I'll\r\ngut three.\" Whereupon the king, dropping into rime with a readiness\r\nworthy of Mr. Wegg, said--\r\n\r\n\"Then gut three, Your name shall be,\" [Footnote added by scanner, who\r\nhas not read much of Dickens: Silas Wegg was a ready-witted character\r\nin \"Our Mutual Friend.\"]\r\n\r\nand conferred a suitable estate on his benefactress.\r\n\r\nAfter all, truth is stranger than fiction.  There is quite enough\r\nlegitimate cause for wonderment in the fact that Tyas is letter for\r\nletter the same name as Douch, or that Strangeways, from a district in\r\nManchester which, lying between the Irwell and the Irk, formerly\r\nsubject to floods, is etymologically strong-wash.  The Joannes Acutus\r\nwhose tomb stands in Florence is the great free-lance captain Sir John\r\nHawkwood, \"omitting the h in Latin as frivolous, and the k and w as\r\nunusual\" (Verstegan, Restitution of Decayed Intelligence, ch. ix),\r\nwhich makes him almost as unrecognizable as that Peter Gower, the\r\nsupposed founder of freemasonry, who turned out to be Pythagoras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE ORIGINS\r\n\r\nMany names are susceptible of two, three, or more explanations.  This\r\nis especially true of some of our commonest monosyllabic surnames.\r\nBell may be from Anglo-Fr. le bel (beau), or from a shop sign, or from\r\nresidence near the church or town bell.  It may even have been applied\r\nto the man who pulled the bell.  Finally, the ancestor may have been a\r\nlady called Isabel, a supposition which does not necessarily imply\r\nillegitimacy (Chapter X).  Ball is sometimes the shortened form of the\r\nonce favourite Baldwin.  It is also from a shop sign, and perhaps most\r\nfrequently of all is for bald.  The latter word is properly balled,\r\ni.e., marked with a ball, or white streak, a word of Celtic origin;\r\ncf. \"piebald,\" i.e., balled like a (mag)pie, and the \"bald-faced\r\nstag.\" [Footnote: Halliwell notes that the nickname Ball is the name\r\nof a horse in Chaucer and in Tusser, of a sheep in the Promptorium\r\nParvulorum, and of a dog in the Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VIII.\r\nIn each case the name alludes to a white mark, or what horsy people\r\ncall a star.  A cow thus marked is called in Scotland a boasand cow,\r\nand from the same word comes the obsolete bawson, badger.]  From the\r\nsame word we get the augmentative Ballard, used, according to Wyclif,\r\nby the little boys who unwisely called to an irritable prophet--\r\n\r\n\"Stey up ballard\" (2 Kings ii.  23).\r\n\r\nThe name may also be personal, Anglo-Sax. Beal-heard.  Rowe may be\r\nlocal, from residence in a row (cf. Fr. Delarue), or it may be an\r\naccidental spelling of the nickname Roe, which also survives in the\r\nMid. English form Ray (Beasts, Chapter XXIII).\r\n\r\nBut Row was also the shortened form of Rowland, or Roland.  Cobb is an\r\nAnglo-Saxon name, as in the local Cobham, but it is also from the\r\nfirst syllable of Cobbold (for either Cuthbeald or Godbeald) and the\r\nsecond of Jacob.  From Jacob come the diminutives Cobbin and Coppin.\r\n\r\nOr, to take some less common names, House not only represents the\r\nmedieval de la house, but also stands for Howes, which, in its turn,\r\nmay be the plural of how, a hill (Chapter XII), or the genitive of\r\nHow, one of the numerous medieval forms of Hugh (Chapter VI).  Hind\r\nmay be for Hine, a farm servant (Chapter III), or for Mid. Eng. hende,\r\ncourteous (cf. for the vowel change Ind, Chapter XIII), and is perhaps\r\nsometimes also an animal nickname (Beasts, Chapter XXIII).  Rouse is\r\ngenerally Fr. roux, i.e. the red, but it may also be the nominative\r\nform of Rou, i.e. of Rolf, or Rollo, the sea-king who conquered\r\nNormandy.  [Footnote: Old French had a declension in two cases.  The\r\nnominative, which has now almost disappeared, was usually\r\ndistinguished by -s.  This survives in a few words, e.g. fils, and\r\nproper names such as Charles, Jules, etc]  Was Holman the holy man,\r\nthe man who lived near a holm, i.e. holly (Chapter XII), on a holm, or\r\nriver island (Chapter XII), or in a hole, or hollow?  All these\r\norigins have equal claims.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, when an apparent nickname is also susceptible of another\r\nsolution, baptismal, local, or occupative, the alternative explanation\r\nis to be preferred, as the popular tendency has always been towards\r\ntwisting names into significant words.  Thus, to take an example of\r\neach class, Diamond is sometimes for an old name Daymond (Daegmund),\r\nPortwine is a corruption of Poitevin, the man from Poitou (Chapter\r\nXI), and Tipler, which now suggests alcoholic excess, was, as late as\r\nthe seventeenth century, the regular name for an alehouse keeper.\r\n\r\nIn a very large number of cases there is a considerable choice for the\r\nmodern bearer of a name.  Any Boon or Bone who wishes to assert that\r\n\r\n                                 Of Hereford's high blood he came,\r\n                                 A race renown'd for knightly fame\r\n                                         (Lord of the Isles, vi.  15),\r\n\r\ncan claim descent from de Bohun.  While, if he holds that kind hearts\r\nare more than coronets, he has an alternative descent from some\r\nmedieval le bon.  This adjective, used as a personal name, gave also\r\nBunn and Bunce; for the spelling of the latter name cf. Dance for\r\nDans, and Pearce for Piers, the nominative of Pierre (Alternative\r\nOrigins, Chapter I), which also survives in Pears and Pearson.  Swain\r\nmay go back to the father of Canute, or to some hoary-headed swain\r\nwho, possibly, tended the swine.  Not all the Seymours are St. Maurs.\r\nSome of them were once Seamers, i.e. tailors.  Gosling is rather\r\ntrivial, but it represents the romantic Jocelyn, in Normandy Gosselin,\r\na diminutive of the once very popular personal name Josse.  Goss is\r\nusually for goose, but any Goss, or Gossett, unwilling to trace his\r\nfamily back to John Goose, \"my lord of Yorkes fole,\" [Footnote: Privy\r\nPurse Expenses of Elizabeth of York (1502).] may likewise choose the\r\nFrench Josse or Gosse.  Goss may also be a dialect pronunciation of\r\ngorse, the older form of which has given the name Gorst.  Coward,\r\nthough humble, cow-herd, is no more timid than Craven, the name of a\r\ndistrict in the West Riding of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES DESIRABLE OR UNDESIRABLE\r\n\r\nMr. Chucks, when in good society, \"seldom bowed, Sir, to anything\r\nunder three syllables\" (Peter Simple, ch. xvii.).  But the length of a\r\nname is not necessarily an index of a noble meaning.  As will be seen\r\n(pp.  74, 5), a great number of our monosyllabic names belong to, the\r\noldest stratum of all.  The boatswain's own name, from Norman-Fr.\r\nchouque, a tree-stump, is identical with the rather aristocratic Zouch\r\nor Such, from the usual French form souche.  Stubbs, which has the\r\nsame meaning, may be compared with Curson, Curzon, Fr. courson, a\r\nstump, a derivative of court, short.  [Footnote: Curson is also a\r\ndialect variant of Christian.]  Pomeroy has a lordly ring, but is the\r\nOld French for Applegarth or Appleyard (Tree Names, Chapter XIV), and\r\nCamoys means flat-nosed, Fr. Camus--\r\n\r\n\"This wenche thikke and wel y-growen was,\r\n With kamuse nose, and eyen greye as glas.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 3973.)\r\n\r\nKingsley, speaking of the name assumed by John Briggs, says--\r\n\r\n\"Vavasour was a very pretty name, and one of those which is [sic]\r\nsupposed by novelists and young ladies to be aristocratic; why so is a\r\npuzzle; as its plain meaning is a tenant farmer and nothing more or\r\nless\" (Two Years Ago, ch. xi.).\r\n\r\nThe word is said to represent a Vulgar Lat. vassus vassorum, vassal of\r\nvassals.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many a homely name has a complimentary meaning.\r\nMr. Wegg did not like the name Boffin, but its oldest form is bon-fin,\r\ngood and fine.  In 1273 Mr. Bumble's name was spelt bon-bel, good and\r\nbeautiful.  With these we may group Bunker, of which the oldest form\r\nis bon-quer (bon coeur), and Boffey, which corresponds to the common\r\nFrench name Bonnefoy, good faith; while the much more assertive\r\nBeaufoy means simply fine beech (Chapter I).\r\n\r\nWith Bunker we may compare Goodhart and Cordeaux, the oldest form of\r\nthe latter being the French name Courdoux.  Momerie and Mummery are\r\nidentical with Mowbray, from Monbrai in Normandy.  Molyneux impresses\r\nmore than Mullins, of which it is merely the dim., Fr. moulins, mills.\r\nThe Yorkshire name Tankard is identical with Tancred.  Stiggins goes\r\nback to the illustrious Anglo-Saxon name Stigand, as Wiggins does to\r\nwigand, a champion.  Cadman represents Caedmon, the name of the\r\npoet-monk of Whitby.  Segar is an imitative form of the Anglo-Sax.\r\nSaegaer, of which the normal modern representative is Sayers.  Giblett\r\nis not a name one would covet, but it stands in the same relationship\r\nto Gilbert as Hamlet does to Hamo.\r\n\r\nA small difference in spelling makes a great difference in the look of\r\na name.  The aristocratic Coke is an archaic spelling of Cook, the\r\nstill more lordly Herries sometimes disguises Harris, while the modern\r\nBrassey is the same as de Bracy in Ivanhoe.  The rather grisly\r\nNightgall is a variant of Nightingale.  The accidental retention of\r\nparticles and articles is also effective, e.g. Delmar, Delamere,\r\nDelapole, impress more than Mears and Pool, and Larpent (Fr.\r\nI'arpent), Lemaitre, and Lestrange more than Acres, Masters, and\r\nStrange.  There are few names of less heroic sound than Spark and\r\nCodlin, yet the former is sometimes a contraction of the picturesque\r\nSparrow-hawk, used as a personal name by the Anglo-Saxons, while the\r\nlatter can be traced back via the earlier forms Quodling (still\r\nfound), Querdling, Querdelyoun to Coeur de Lion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. A MEDIEVAL ROLL\r\n\r\n\"Quelque diversité d'herbes qu'il y alt, tout s'enveloppe sous le nom\r\nde salade; de mesme, sous la considération des noms, je m'en voys\r\nfaire icy une galimafree de divers articles.\"  (Montaigne, Essais, i.\r\n46.)\r\n\r\nJust as, in studying a new language, the linguist finds it most\r\nhelpful to take a simple text and hammer out in detail every word and\r\ngrammatical form it contains, so the student of name-lore cannot do\r\nbetter than tackle a medieval roll and try to connect every name in it\r\nwith those of the present day.  I give here two lists of names from\r\nthe Hundred Rolls of 1273.  The first contains the names of London and\r\nMiddlesex jurymen, most of them, especially the Londoners, men of\r\nsubstance and position.  The second is a list of cottagers resident in\r\nthe village of Steeple Claydon in Bucks.  Even a cursory perusal of\r\nthese lists should Suffice to dispel all recollection of the nightmare\r\n\"philology\" which has been so much employed to obscure what is\r\nperfectly simple and obvious; while a very slight knowledge of Latin\r\nand French is all that is required to connect these names of men who\r\nwere dead and buried before the Battle of Crecy with those to be found\r\nin any modern directory.  The brief indications supplied under each\r\nname will be found in a fuller form in the various chapters of the\r\nbook to which references are given.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity I have given the modern English form of each Christian\r\nname and expanded the abbreviations used by the official compilers.\r\nIt will be noticed that English, Latin, and Anglo-French are used\r\nindifferently, that le is usually, though not always, put before the\r\ntrade-name or nickname, that de is put before place-names and at\r\nbefore spots which have no proper name.  The names in the right-hand\r\ncolumn are only specimens of the, often very numerous, modern\r\nequivalents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON JURYMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nHundred Rolls\r\n\r\nModern Form\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Dibel.\r\n\r\nDibble (Theobald).\r\n\r\nInitial t- and d- alternate (Dialectic Variants, Chapter III)\r\naccording to locality.  In Tennyson, for Denison, son of Denis, we\r\nhave the opposite change.  The forms assumed by Theobald are very\r\nnumerous (Chapter I).  Besides Dibble we have the shorter Dibb.  Other\r\nvariants are Dyball, Dipple, Tipple, Tidball, Tudball, and a number of\r\nnames in Teb-, Tib-, Tub-.  The reason for the great popularity of the\r\nname is obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaldwin le Bocher.\r\n\r\nButcher.\r\n\r\nOn the various forms of this name, see Chapter XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Hauteyn.\r\n\r\nHawtin\r\n\r\nThe Yorkshire name Auty is probably unconnected.  It seems rather to\r\nbe an altered form of a Scandinavian personal name cognate with Odo.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry le Wimpler.\r\n\r\nThe name has apparently disappeared with the garment.  But it is never\r\nsafe to assert that a surname is quite extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen le Peron\r\n\r\nFearon\r\n\r\nFrom Old Fr. feron, ferron, smith.  In a few cases French has -on as\r\nan agential suffix (Chapter XVIII).\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam de Paris.\r\n\r\nParis, Parris, Parish.\r\n\r\nThe commoner modern form Parish is seldom to be derived from our word\r\nparish.  This rarely occurs, while the entry de Paris is, on the other\r\nhand, very common.\r\n\r\n\r\nHundred Rolls\r\n\r\nModern Form\r\n\r\n\r\nRoger le Wyn.\r\n\r\nWynne.\r\n\r\nAnglo-Saxon wine, friend.  Also a Celtic nickname, Identical with\r\nGwynne (Chapter XXII).\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew de Pomfrait\r\n\r\nPomfret\r\n\r\nThe usual pronunciation of Pontefract, broken bridge, one of the few\r\nEnglish place-names of purely Latin origin (Chapter XIII).  The Old\r\nFrench form would be Pont-frait.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard le Paumer.\r\n\r\nPalmer.\r\n\r\nA man who had made pilgrimage to the Holy Land (Chapter XVII).  The\r\nmodern spelling is restored, but the _l_ remains mute.  It is just\r\npossible that this name sometimes means tennis-player, as tennis, Fr.\r\nle jeu de paume, once played with the palm of the hand, is of great\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter Poletar.\r\n\r\nPointer.\r\n\r\nA dealer in poults, i.e. fowls.  For the lengthened form poulterer,\r\ncf. fruiterer for fruiter, and see Chapter XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nReginald Aurifaber.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith.\r\n\r\nThe French form orfévre may have given the name Offer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Deubeneye.\r\n\r\nDaubeney, Dabney.\r\n\r\nFr. d'Aubigny.  One of the many cases in which the French preposition\r\nhas been incorporated in the name.  Cf. Danvers, for d'Anvers,\r\nAntwerp, and see Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHundred Rolls\r\n\r\nModern Form\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Knotte\r\n\r\nKnott\r\n\r\nFrom Scandinavian Cnut, Canute.  This name is also local, from knot, a\r\nhillock, and has of course become confused (Variant Spellings, Chapter\r\nIII) with the nickname Nott, with cropped hair (Chapter XXII)--\r\n\r\n\"Thou nott-pated fool.\"\r\n\r\n (1 Henry IV, ii.  4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter le Wyte.\r\n\r\nWhite\r\n\r\nThe large number of Whites is partly to be accounted for by their\r\nhaving absorbed the name Wight (Chapter XXII) from Mid. Eng. wiht,\r\nvaliant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam le Sutel.\r\n\r\nSuttle.\r\n\r\nBoth Eng. subtle and Fr. subtil are restored spellings, which do not\r\nappear in nomenclature (Chapter III).\r\n\r\n\r\nFulk de Sancto Edmundo.\r\n\r\nTedman.\r\n\r\nThe older form would be Tednam.  Bury St. Edmund's is sometimes\r\nreferred to as Tednambury.  For the mutilation of the word saint in\r\nplace-names, see Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam le Boteler.\r\n\r\nButler.\r\n\r\nMore probably a bottle-maker than what we understand by a butler, the\r\norigin being of course the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nGilbert Lupus\r\n\r\nWolf.\r\n\r\nWolf, and the Scandinavian Ulf, are both common as personal names\r\nbefore the Conquest, but a good many Modern bearers of the name are\r\nGerman Jews (Chapter IV).  Old Fr. lou (loup) is one source of Low.\r\n\r\n\r\nHundred Rolls\r\n\r\nModern Form\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Juvenis.\r\n\r\nYoung\r\n\r\nSenex is rarely found.  The natural tendency was to distinguish the\r\nyounger man from his father.  Senior is generally to be explained\r\ndifferently (Chapter XV).\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Braciator.\r\n\r\nBrewer.\r\n\r\nThe French form brasseur also survives as Bracher and Brasher, the\r\nlatter being also confused with Brazier, the worker in brass.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn de Cruce.\r\n\r\nCross, Crouch.\r\n\r\nA man who lived near some outdoor cross.  The form crouch survives in\r\n\"Crutched Friars.\" Hence also the name Croucher.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew le Candeler.\r\n\r\nCandler, Chandler.\r\n\r\nInitial c- for ch- shows Norman or Picard origin (Chapter III).\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Bernard.\r\n\r\nBarnard, Barnett.\r\n\r\nThe change from _er_ to _ar_ is regular; cf. Clark, and see Chapter\r\nIII.  The endings -ard, -ald, are generally changed to -ett; cf.\r\nEverett for Everard, Barrett for Berald, Garrett for Gerard, Garrard,\r\nwhence the imitative Garrison for Garretson.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam de Bosco.\r\n\r\nBush, Busk, Buss.\r\n\r\n\"For there is neither bush nor hay (Chapter XIII)\r\nIn May that it nyl shrouded bene.\"\r\n\r\n(Romaunt of the Rose, 54.)\r\n\r\nThe name might also be translated as Wood.  The corresponding name of\r\nFrench origin is Boyce or Boyes, Fr. bois (Chapter XIV).\r\n\r\n\r\nHundred Rolls\r\n\r\nModern Form\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry de Sancta Ositha.\r\n\r\nToosey.\r\n\r\nCf. Fulk de Sancto Edmundo (supra), and cf. Tooley St.\r\nfor St. Olave St. (Chapter III).\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter ate Stede.\r\n\r\nStead.\r\n\r\nIn this case the preposition has not coalesced, as in Adeane, at the\r\ndean, i.e. hollow, Agate, at gate, etc. (Chapter XII).\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam le Fevere.\r\n\r\nWright, Smith.\r\n\r\nThe French name survives as Feaver and Fevyer.  Cf. also the Lat.\r\nFaber, which is not always a modern German importation\r\n\r\n(Chapter XII).\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas de Cumbe.\r\n\r\nCombe, Coombes.\r\n\r\nA West-country name for a hollow in a hillside (Chapter XII).\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn State.\r\n\r\nState, Stacey.\r\n\r\nGenerally for Eustace, but sometimes perhaps for Anastasia, as we find\r\nStacey used as a female name (Chapter III).\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard le Teynturier.\r\n\r\nDyer, Dexter.\r\n\r\nDexter represents Mid. Eng. dighester, with the feminine agential\r\nsuffix (Chapter XV).\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry le Waleys.\r\n\r\nWallis, Walsh, Welch.\r\n\r\nLiterally the foreigner, but especially applied by the English to the\r\nWestern Celts.  Quelch represents the: Welsh pronunciation.  With\r\nWallis cf. Cornwallis, Mid. Eng. le cornwaleis (Chapter X).\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn le Bret.\r\n\r\nBrett, Britton.\r\n\r\nAn inhabitant of Brittany, perhaps resident in that Breton colony in\r\nLondon called Little Britain.

We now spell the common noun clerk by\r\netymological reaction, but educated people pronounce the word as it\r\nwas generally written up to the eighteenth century (Chapter III).\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen le Hatter\r\n\r\nHatter\r\n\r\nThe great rarity of this name is a curious problem (Chapter XV).  The\r\nname Capper exists, though it is not very common.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas le Batur.\r\n\r\nThresher.\r\n\r\nBut, being a Londoner, he was more probably a gold-beater, or perhaps\r\na beater of cloth.  The name Beater also survives.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander de Leycestre\r\n\r\nLeicester, Lester.\r\n\r\nFor the simpler spelling, once usual and still adopted by those who\r\nchalk the names on the mail-vans at St. Pancras, cf. such names as\r\nWorster, Wooster, Gloster, etc. (Chapter XI).\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert le Noreys.\r\n\r\nNorris, Nurse.\r\n\r\nOld Fr. noreis, the Northerner (Chapter XI), or norice (nourrice), the\r\nnurse, foster-mother (Chapter XX).\r\n\r\n\r\nReginald le Blond\r\n\r\nBlount, Blunt.\r\n\r\nFr. blond, fair.  We have also the dim. Blundell.  The corresponding\r\nEnglish name is Fairfax, from Mid.

Armour for armourer, and\r\nsee Chapter XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nGodfrey le Furmager.\r\n\r\nCheeseman, Firminger.\r\n\r\nFrom Old Fr. formage (fromage).  The intrusion of the n in Firminger\r\nis regular; cf.

The latter is more likely.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlan Allutarius.\r\n\r\nWhittier.\r\n\r\nLat. alutarius, a \"white-tawer\", Similarly, Mid. Eng. stan-heawere,\r\nstone-hewer, is contracted to Stanier, now almost swallowed up by\r\nStainer.  The simple tawer is also one origin of the name Tower.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter le Rus.\r\n\r\nRuss, Rush, Rouse.\r\n\r\nFr. roux, of red complexion.  Cf. the dim. Russell, Fr.

At the time of compilation they were not hereditary.\r\nThus the last man on the list is Simon Johnson, but his father was\r\nJohn Neilson, or Nelson (Chapter X), and his son would be ---- Simpson,\r\nSims, etc.  This would go on until, at a period varying with the\r\nlocality, the wealth and importance of the individual, one name in the\r\nline would become accidentally petrified and persist to the present\r\nday.  The chain could, of course, be broken at any time by the\r\nassumption of a name from one of the other three classes (Chapter I).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. SPELLING AND SOUND\r\n\r\n\"Do you spell it with a V or a W?\" inquired the judge.\r\n\r\n\"That depends upon the taste and fancy of the speller, my lord,\"\r\nreplied Sam.  \"I never had occasion to spell it more than once or\r\ntwice in my life, but I spells it with a V.\"\r\n\r\n(Pickwick, ch. xxxiv.)\r\n\r\nMany people are particular about the spelling of their names.  I am\r\nmyself, although, as a student of philology, I ought to know better.\r\nThe greatest of Englishmen was so careless in the matter as to sign\r\nhimself Shakspe, a fact usually emphasized by Baconian when speaking\r\nof the illiterate clown of Stratford-on-Avon.  Equally illiterate must\r\nhave been the learned Dr. Crown, who, in the various books he\r\npublished in the latter half of the seventeenth century, spelt his\r\nname, indifferently Cron, Croon, Croun, Crone, Croone, Croune.  The\r\nmodern spelling of any particular name Is a pure accident.  Before the\r\nElementary Education Act of 1870 a considerable proportion of English\r\npeople did not spell their names at all.  They trusted to the parson\r\nand the clerk, who did their best with unfamiliar names.  Even now old\r\npeople in rural districts may find half a dozen orthographic variants\r\nof their own names among the sparse documentary records of their\r\nlives.  Dugdale the antiquary is said to have found more than 130\r\nvariants of Mainwaring among the parchments of that family.  Bardsley\r\nquotes, under the name Blenkinsop--\r\n\r\n\"On April 2 3, 1470, Elizabeth Blynkkynesoppye, of Blynkkynsoppe,\r\nwidow of Thomas Blynkyensope, of Blynkkensope, received a general\r\npardon\"--\r\n\r\nfour variants in one sentence.  In the List of Foreign Protestants and\r\nAliens in England (1618) we have Andrian Medlor and Ellin Medler his\r\nwife, Johan Cosen and Abraham Cozen, brethren.  The death of Sarah\r\nInward, daughter of Richard Inwood, was registered in 1685.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIANT SPELLINGS\r\n\r\nMedieval spelling was roughly phonetic, i.e. it attempted to reproduce\r\nthe sound of the period and region, and even men of learning, as late\r\nas the eighteenth century, were very uncertain in matters of\r\northography.  The spelling of the language is now practically\r\nnormalized, although in conformity with no sort of principle; but the\r\nfamily name, as a private possession, has kept its freedom.  Thus, if\r\nwe wish to speak poetically of a meadow, I suppose we should call it a\r\nlea, but the same word is represented by the family names Lea, Lee,\r\nLey, Leigh, Legh, Legge, Lay, Lye, perhaps the largest group of local\r\nsurnames we possess.\r\n\r\nIn matters of spelling we observe various tendencies.  One is the\r\nretention of an archaic form, which does not necessarily affect\r\npronunciation.  Late Mid. English was fond of y for i, of double\r\nconsonants, and of final -e.  All these appear in the names Thynne\r\n(thin) and Wyllie (wily).  Therefore we should not deride the man who\r\nwrites himself Smythe.  But in some cases the pronunciation suffers,\r\ne.g. the name Fry represents Mid. Eng. fri, one of the forms of the\r\nadjective that is now written free.  Burt represents Anglo-Sax.\r\nbeorht, the normal result of which is Bright.  We now write subtle and\r\nperfect, artificial words, in the second of which the pronunciation\r\nhas been changed in accordance with the restored spelling; but the\r\nolder forms survive in the names Suttle and Parfitt--\r\n\r\n\"He was a verray parfit, gentil knyght.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 72.)\r\n\r\nThe usual English pronunciation of names like Mackenzie, Menzies,\r\nDalziel, is due to the substitution by the printer of a z for an\r\nobsolete letter that represented a soft palatal sound more like y.\r\n[Footnote: This substitution has led one writer on surnames, who\r\napparently confuses bells with beans, to derive the rare surname\r\nBilliter, whence Billiter's Lane in the City, from \"Belzetter, i.e.,\r\nthe Bell-setter.\" The Mid. Eng. \"bellezeter, campanarius\" (Prompt.\r\nParv.), was a bell-founder, from a verb related to geysir, ingot, and\r\nGer. giessen, to pour.  Robert le bellegeter was a freeman of York in\r\n1279.]\r\n\r\nWe have an archaic plural ending in Knollys (Knowles), the plural of\r\nknoll, and in Sandys, and an archaic spelling in Sclater for Slater or\r\nSlatter, for both slat and slate come from Old Fr. esclat (éclat), a\r\nsplinter.  With Knollys and Sandys we may put Pepys, for the existence\r\nof the dims.  Pipkin, Peppitt, and Peppiatt points to the medieval\r\nname Pipun, corresponding to the royal Pepin.  Streatfeild preserves\r\nvariant spellings of street and field.  In Gardiner we have the Old\r\nNorthern French word which now, as a common noun, gardener, is\r\nassimilated to garden, the normal French form of which appears in\r\nJardine.\r\n\r\nSuch orthographic variants as i and y, Simons, Symons, Ph and f,\r\nJephcott, Jeffcott, s and c, Pearce, Pearce, Rees, Reece, Sellars\r\n(cellars), ks and x, Dickson, Dixon, are a matter of taste or\r\naccident.  Initial letters which became mute often disappeared in\r\nspelling, e.g. Wray, a corner (Chapter XIII), has become hopelessly\r\nconfused with Ray, a roe, Knott, from Cnut, i.e. Canute, or from\r\ndialect knot, a hillock, with Noll, crop-haired.  Knowlson is the son\r\nof Nowell (Chapter IX) or of Noll, i.e. Oliver.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when Mr. X. asserts that his name has always been\r\nspelt in such and such a way, he is talking nonsense.  If his\r\ngreat-grandfather's will is accessible, he will probably find two or\r\nthree variants in that alone.  The great Duke of Wellington, as a\r\nyounger man, signed himself Arthur Wesley--\r\n\r\n\"He was colonel of Dad's regiment, the Thirty-third foot, after Dad\r\nleft the army, and then he changed his name from Wesley to Wellesley,\r\nor else the other way about\"\r\n\r\n(KIPLING, Marklake Witches);\r\n\r\nand I know two families the members of which disagree as to the\r\northography of their names.  We have a curious affectation in such\r\nspellings as ffrench, ffoulkes, etc., where the ff is merely the\r\nmethod of indicating the capital letter in early documents.\r\n\r\nThe telescoping of long names is a familiar phenomenon.  Well-known\r\nexamples are Cholmondeley, Chumley, Marjoribanks, Marchbanks,\r\nMainwaring, Mannering.  Less familiar are Auchinleck, Affleck,\r\nBoutevilain, Butlin, Postlethwaite, Posnett, Sudeley, Sully,\r\nWolstenholme, Woosnam.  Ensor is from the local Edensor, Cavendish was\r\nregularly Candish for the Elizabethans, while Cavenham in Suffolk has\r\ngiven the surname Canham.  Daventry has become Daintree, Dentry, and\r\nprobably the imitative Dainty, while Stepson is for Stevenson.  It is\r\nthis tendency which makes the connection between surnames and village\r\nnames so difficult to establish in many cases, for the artificial name\r\nas it occurs in the gazetteer often gives little clue to the local\r\npronunciation.  It is easy to recognize Bickenhall or Bickenhill in\r\nBicknell and Puttenham in Putnam, but the identity of Wyndham with\r\nWymondham is only clear when we know the local Pronunciation of the\r\nlatter name.  Milton and Melton are often telescoped forms of\r\nMiddleton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIALECTIC VARIANTS\r\n\r\nDialectic variants must also be taken into account.  Briggs and Rigg\r\nrepresent the Northern forms of Bridges and Ridge, and Philbrick is a\r\ndisguised Fellbrigg.  In Egg we have rather the survival of the Mid.\r\nEnglish spelling of Edge.  Braid, Lang, Strang, are Northern variants\r\nof Broad, Long, Strong.  Auld is for Old while Tamson is for Thompson\r\nand Dabbs for Dobbs (Robert).  We have the same change of vowel in\r\nRaper, for Roper.  Venner generally means hunter, Fr. veneur, but\r\nsometimes represents the West-country form of Fenner, the fen-dweller;\r\ncf. Vidler for fiddler, and Vanner for Fanner, the winnower.\r\n\r\nWe all the difficulty we have in catching a new and unfamiliar name,\r\nand the subterfuges we employ to find out what it really is.  In such\r\ncases we do not get the help from association and analogy which serves\r\nus in dealing with language in general, but find ourselves in the\r\nposition of a foreigner or child hearing unfamiliar word for the first\r\ntime.  We realize how many imperceptible shades there are between a\r\nshort i and a short e, or between a fully voiced g and a voiceless k,\r\nexamples suggested to me by my having lately understood a Mr. Riggs to\r\nbe a Mr. Rex.\r\n\r\nWe find occurring in surnames examples of those consonantal changes\r\nwhich do not violate the great Phonetic law that such changes can only\r\noccur regularly within the same group, i.e. that a labial cannot\r\nalternate with a palatal, or a dental with either.  It is thus that we\r\nfind b alternating with p, Hobbs and Hopps (Robert), Bollinger and\r\nPullinger, Fr. boulanger; g with k, Cutlack and Goodlake (Anglo-Sax.\r\nGuthlac), Diggs and Dix (Richard), Gipps and Kipps (Gilbert), Catlin\r\nand Galling (Catherine); j with ch, Jubb or Jupp and Chubb (Job); d\r\nwith t, Proud and Prout (Chapter XXII), Dyson and Tyson (Dionisia),\r\nand also with th, Carrodus and Carruthers (a hamlet in Dumfries).  The\r\nalternation of c and ch or g and j in names of French origin is\r\ndialectic, the c and g representing the Norman-Picard pronunciation,\r\ne.g. Campion for Champion, Gosling for Joslin.  In some cases we have\r\nshown a definite preference for one form, e.g. Chancellor and\r\nChappell, but Carpenter and Camp.  In English names c is northern, ch\r\nsouthern, e.g. Carlton, Charlton, Kirk, Church.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few very common vowel changes.  The sound er usually\r\nbecame ar, as in Barclay (Berkeley), Clark, Darby, Garrard (Gerard),\r\nJarrold (Gerald), Harbord (Herbert), Jarvis (Gervase), Marchant,\r\nSargent, etc., while Larned, our great-grandfathers' pronunciation of\r\n\"learned,\" corresponds to Fr. Littri.  Thus Parkins is the same name\r\nas Perkins.  (Peter), and these also give Parks and Perks, the former\r\nof which is usually not connected with Park.  To Peter, or rather to\r\nFr. Pierre, belong also Parr, Parry and Perry, though Parry is\r\ngenerally Welsh (Chapter VI).  The dims.  Parrott, Perrott, etc., were\r\nsometimes nicknames, the etymology being the same, for our word parrot\r\nis from Fr. pierrot.  To the freedom with which this sound is spelt,\r\ne.g. in Herd, Heard, Hird, Hurd, we also owe Purkiss for Perkins; cf.\r\nappurtenance for appartenance.\r\n\r\nThe letter l seems also to exercise a demoralizing influence on the\r\nadjacent vowel.  Juliana became Gillian, and from this, or from the\r\nmasculine form Julian, we get Jalland, Jolland, and the shortened\r\nGell, Gill (Chapter VI), and Jull.  Gallon, which Bardsley groups with\r\nthese, is more often a French name, from the Old German Walo, or a\r\ncorruption of the still commoner French name Galland, likewise of\r\nGermanic origin.\r\n\r\nWe find also such irregular vowel changes as Flinders for Flanders,\r\nand conversely Packard for Picard.  Pottinger (see below) sometimes\r\nbecomes Pettinger as Portugal gives Pettingall.  The general tendency\r\nis towards that thinning of the vowel that we get in mister for master\r\nand Miss Miggs's mim for ma'am.  Littimer for Lattimer is an example\r\nof this.  But in Royle for the local Ryle we find the same broadening\r\nwhich has given boil, a swelling, for earlier bile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHESIS\r\n\r\nAmong phonetic changes which occur with more or less regularity are\r\nthose called aphesis, epenthesis, epithesis, assimilation,\r\ndissimilation, and metathesis, convenient terms which are less learned\r\nthan they appear.  Aphesis is the loss of the unaccented first\r\nsyllable, as in 'baccy and 'later.  It occurs almost regularly in\r\nwords of French origin, e.g. squire and esquire, Prentice and\r\napprentice.  When such double forms exist, the surname invariably\r\nassumes the popular form, e.g. Prentice, Squire.  Other examples are\r\nBonner, i.e. debonair, Jenner, Jenoure, for Mid. Eng. engenour,\r\nengineer, Cator, Chaytor, Old Fr. acatour (acheteur), a buyer--\r\n\r\n\"A gentil maunciple was they of a temple,\r\n Of which achatours mighte take exemple\" (A. 567),\r\n\r\nSpencer, dispenser, a spender, Stacey for Eustace, Vick and Veck for\r\nLevick, i.e. l'évêque, the bishop, Pottinger for the obsolete potigar,\r\nan apothecary, etc.\r\n\r\nThe institution now known as the \"orspittle\" was called by our\r\nunlettered forefathers the \"spital,\" hence the names Spittle and\r\nSpittlehouse.  A well-known amateur goal-keeper has the appropriate\r\nname Fender, for defender.\r\n\r\nMany names beginning with n are due to aphesis, e.g. Nash for atten\r\nash, Nalder, Nelms, Nock, atten oak, Nokes, Nye, atten ey, at the\r\nisland, Nangle, atten angle, Nind or Nend, atten ind or end.  With\r\nthese we may compare Twells, at wells, and the numerous cases in which\r\nthe first part of a personal name is dropped, e.g. Tolley,\r\nBartholomew, Munn, Edmund, Pott, Philpot, dim. of Philip (see p.87),\r\nand the less common Facey, from Boniface, and Loney, from Apollonia,\r\nthe latter of which has also given Applin.\r\n\r\nWhen a name compounded with Saint begins with a vowel, we get such\r\nforms as Tedman, St. Edmund, Tobin, St. Aubyn, Toosey, St. Osith,\r\nToomey, St. Omer, Tooley, St. Olave; cf. Tooley St. for St. Olave St.\r\nand tawdry from St. Audrey.  When the saint's name begins with a\r\nconsonant, we get, instead of aphesis, a telescoped pronunciation,\r\ne.g. Selinger, St. Leger, Seymour, St. Maur, Sinclair, St. Clair,\r\nSemark, St. Mark, Semple, St. Paul, Simper, St. Pierre, Sidney,\r\nprobably for St. Denis, with which we may compare the educated\r\npronunciation of St. John.  These names are all of local origin, from\r\nchapelries in Normandy or England.\r\n\r\nEpenthesis is the insertion of a sound which facilitates\r\npronunciation, such as that of b in Fr. chambre, from Lat. camera.\r\nThe intrusive sound may be a vowel or a consonant, as in the names\r\nHenery, Hendry, perversions of Henry.  [Footnote: On the usual fate of\r\nthis name in English, see below.]\r\n\r\nTo Hendry we owe the northern Henderson, which has often coalesced\r\nwith Anderson, from Andrew.  These are contracted into Henson and\r\nAnson, the latter also from Ann and Agnes (Chapter IX).  Intrusion\r\nof a vowel is seen in Greenaway, Hathaway, heath way, Treadaway,\r\ntrade (i.e. trodden) way, etc., also in Horniman, Alabone, Alban,\r\nMinister, minster, etc.  But epenthesis of a consonant is more common,\r\nespecially b or p after m, and d after n.  Examples are Gamble for\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon name Gamel, Hamblin for Hamlin, a double diminutive\r\nof Hamo, Simpson, Thompson, etc., and Grindrod, green royd (see p. III).\r\nThere is also the special case of n before g in such names as Firminger\r\n(Chapter XV), Massinger (Chapter XX), Pottinger (Chapter XVIII), etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITHESIS AND ASSIMILATION\r\n\r\nEpithesis, or the addition of a final consonant, is common in\r\nuneducated speech, e.g. scholard, gownd, garding, etc.  I say\r\n\"uneducated,\" but many such forms have been adapted by the language,\r\ne.g. sound, Fr. son, and we have the name Kitching for kitchen.  The\r\nusual additions are -d, -t, or -g after n, e.g. Simmonds, Simon,\r\nHammond, Hammant, Fr. Hamon, Hind, a farm labourer, of which the older\r\nform is Hine (Chapter XVII), Collings for Collins, Jennings, Fr.\r\nJeannin, dim. of Jean, Aveling from the female name Avelina or Evelyn.\r\nNeill is for Neil, Nigel.  We have epithetic -b in Plumb, the man who\r\nlived by the plum-tree and epithetic -p in Crump (Chapter II).\r\n\r\nAssimilation is the tendency of a sound to imitate its neighbour.\r\nThus the d of Hud (Chapter I) sometimes becomes t in contact with the\r\nsharp s, hence Hutson; Tomkins tends to become Tonkin, whence Tonks,\r\nif the m and k are not separated by the epenthetic p, Tompkins.  In\r\nHopps and Hopkins we have the b of Hob assimilated to the sharp s and\r\nk, while in Hobbs we pronounce a final -z.  It is perhaps under the\r\ninfluence of the initial labial that Milson, son of Miles or Michael,\r\nsometimes becomes Milsom, and Branson, son of Brand, appears as\r\nBransom.\r\n\r\nThe same group of names is affected by dissimilation, i.e. the\r\ninstinct to avoid the recurrence of the same sound.  Thus Ranson, son\r\nof Ranolf or Randolf, becomes Ransom [Footnote: So also Fr, rançon\r\ngives Eng. ransom.  The French surname Rançon is probably aphetic for\r\nLaurançon.]  by dissimilation of one n, and Hanson, son of Han\r\n(Chapter I), becomes Hansom.  In Sansom we have Samson assimilated to\r\nSamson and then dissimilated.  Dissimilation especially affects the\r\nsounds l, n, r.  Bullivant is found earlier as bon enfaunt\r\n(Goodchild), just as a braggart Burgundian was called by Tudor\r\ndramatists a burgullian.  Bellinger is for Barringer, an Old French\r\nname of Teutonic origin.  [Footnote: \"When was Bobadil here, your\r\ncaptain?  that rogue, that foist, that fencing burgullian\" (Jonson,\r\nEvery Man in his Humour, iv. 2).]  Those people called Salisbury who\r\ndo not hail from Salesbury in Lancashire must have had an ancestor de\r\nSares-bury, for such was the earlier name of Salisbury (Sarum).  A\r\nnumber of occupative names have lost the last syllable by\r\ndissimilation, e.g. Pepper for pepperer, Armour for armourer.  For\r\nfurther examples see Chapter XV.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted here that, apart from dissimilation, the sounds l, n,\r\nr, have a general tendency to become confused, e.g. Phillimore is for\r\nFinamour (Dearlove), which also appears as Finnemore and Fenimore, the\r\nlatter also to be explained from fen and moor.  Catlin is from\r\nCatherine.  Balestier, a cross-bow man, gives Bannister, and Hamnet\r\nand Hamlet both occur as the name of one of Shakespeare's sons.\r\nJanico or Jenico, Fr. Janicot may be the origin of Jellicoe.\r\n\r\nWe also get the change of r to l in Hal, for Harry, whence Hallett,\r\nHawkins (Halkins), and the Cornish Hockin, Mal or Mol for Mary, whence\r\nMalleson, Mollison, etc., and Pell for Peregrine.  This confusion is\r\ncommon in infantile speech, e.g. I have heard a small child express\r\ngreat satisfaction at the presence on the table of \"blackbelly dam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETATHESIS\r\n\r\nMetathesis, or the transposition of sound, chiefly affects l and r,\r\nespecially the latter.  Our word cress is from Mid. Eng. kers, which\r\nappears in Karslake, Toulmin is for Tomlin, a double dim., -el-in, of\r\nTom, Grundy is for Gundry, from Anglo-Sax. Gundred, and Joe Gargery\r\ndescended from a Gregory.  Burnell is for Brunel, dim. of Fr. brun,\r\nbrown, and Thrupp is for Thorp, a village (Chapter XIII).  Strickland\r\nwas formerly Stirkland, Cripps is the same as Crisp, from Mid. Eng.\r\ncrisp, curly.  Prentis Jankin had--\r\n\r\n\"Crispe here, shynynge as gold so fyn\"\r\n\r\n(D. 304);\r\n\r\nand of Fame we are told that\r\n\r\n\"Her heer was oundie (wavy) and crips.\"\r\n\r\n(House of Fame, iii.  296.)\r\n\r\nBoth names may also be short for Crispin, the etymology being the same\r\nin any case.  Apps is sometimes for asp, the tree now called by the\r\nadjectival name aspen (cf. linden).  We find Thomas atte apse in the\r\nreign of Edward III.\r\n\r\nThe letters l, n, r also tend to disappear from no other cause than\r\nrapid or careless pronunciation.\r\n\r\nHence we get Home for Holme (Chapter XII), Ferris for Ferrers, a\r\nFrench local name, Batt for Bartholomew, Gatty for Gertrude, Dallison\r\nfor d'Alençon.  The loss of _r_ after a vowel is also exemplified by\r\nFoster for Forster, Pannell and Pennell for Parnell (sometimes), Gath\r\nfor Garth (Chapter XIII), and Mash for Marsh.  To the loss of n before\r\ns we owe such names as Pattison, Paterson, etc., son of Paton, the\r\ndim. of Patrick, and Robison for Robinson, and also a whole group of\r\nnames like Jenks and Jinks for Jenkins (John), Wilkes for Wilkins,\r\nGilkes, Danks, Perks, Hawkes, Jukes for Judkins (Chapter VI), etc.\r\nHere I should also include Biggs, which is not always connected with\r\nBigg, for we seldom find adjectival nicknames with -s.  It seems to\r\nrepresent Biggins, from obsolete biggin, a building (Chapter XIII).\r\n\r\nThe French nasal n often disappeared before r.  Thus denrée, lit.  a\r\npennyworth, appears in Anglo-French as darree.  Similarly Henry became\r\nHarry, except in Scotland, and the English Kings of that name were\r\nalways called Harry by their subjects.  It is to this pronunciation\r\nthat we owe the popularity of Harris and Harrison, and the frequency\r\nof Welsh Parry, ap, Harry, as compared with Penry.  A compromise\r\nbetween Henry and Harry is seen in Hanrott, from the French dim.\r\nHenriot.\r\n\r\nThe initial h-, which we regard with such veneration, is treated quite\r\narbitrarily in surnames.  We find a well-known medieval poet called\r\nindifferently Occleve and Hoccleve.  Harnett is the same as Arnett,\r\nfor Arnold, Ewens and Heavens are both from Ewan, and Heaven is an\r\nimitative form of Evan.  In Hoskins, from the medieval Osekin, a dim.\r\nof some Anglo-Saxon name such as Oswald (Chapter VII), the aspirate\r\nhas definitely prevailed.  The Devonshire name Hexter is for Exeter,\r\nArbuckle is a corruption of Harbottle, in Northumberland.  The Old\r\nFrench name Ancel appears as both Ansell and Hansell, and Earnshaw\r\nexists side by side with Hearnshaw (Chapter XII).\r\n\r\nThe loss of h is especially common when it is the initial letter of a\r\nsuffix, e.g. Barnum for Barnham, Haslam, (hazel), Blenkinsop for\r\nBlenkin's hope (see hope, Chapter XII), Newall for Newhall, Windle for\r\nWind Hill, Tickell for Tick Hill, in Yorkshire, etc.  But Barnum and\r\nHaslam may also represent the Anglo-Saxon dative plural of the words\r\nbarn and hazel.  A man who minded sheep was once called a Shepard, or\r\nSheppard, as he still is, though we spell it shepherd.  The letter w\r\ndisappears in the same way; thus Greenish is for Greenwich, Horridge\r\nfor Horwich, Aspinall for Aspinwall, Millard for Millward, the\r\nmill-keeper, Boxall for Boxwell, Caudle for Cauldwell (cold); and the\r\nAnglo-Saxon names in -win are often confused with those in -ing, e.g.\r\nGooding, Goodwin; Golding, Goldwin; Gunning, Gunwin, etc.  In this way\r\nHarding has prevailed over the once equally common Hardwin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBABY PHONETICS\r\n\r\nFinally, we have to consider what may be called baby phonetics, the\r\nsound-changes which seem rather to transgress general phonetic laws.\r\nYoung children habitually confuse dentals and palatals, thus a child\r\nmay be heard to say that he has \"dot a told.\" This tendency is,\r\nhowever, not confined to children.  My own name, which is a very\r\nuncommon one, is a stumbling-block to most people, and when I give it\r\nin a shop the scribe has generally got as far as Wheat- before he can\r\nbe stopped.\r\n\r\nWe find both Estill and Askell for the medieval Asketil, and Thurtle\r\nalternating with Thurkle, originally Thurketil (Chapter VII).\r\nBertenshave is found for Birkenshaw, birch wood, Bartley, sometimes\r\nfrom Bartholomew, is more often for Berkeley, and both Lord Bacon and\r\nHorace Walpole wrote Twitnam for Twickenham.  Jeffcock, dim. of\r\nGeoffrey, becomes Jeffcott, while Glascock is for the local Glascott.\r\nHere the palatal takes the place of the dental, as in Brangwin for\r\nAnglo-Sax. Brandwine.  Middleman is a dialect form of Michaelmas\r\n(Chapter IX).  We have the same change in tiddlebat for stickleback, a\r\nword which exemplifies another point in baby phonetics, viz. the loss\r\nof initial s-, as in the classic instance tummy.  To this loss of\r\ns- we owe Pick for Spick (Chapter XXIII), Pink for Spink, a dialect\r\nword for the chaffinch, and, I think, Tout for Stout.  The name Stacey\r\nis found as Tacey in old Notts registers.  On the other hand, an\r\ninorganic s- is sometimes prefixed, as in Sturgess for the older\r\nTurgis.  For the loss of s- we may compare Shakespeare's parmaceti (1\r\nHenry IV. i.  3), and for its addition the adjective spruce, from\r\nPruce, i.e. Prussia.\r\n\r\nWe also find the infantile confusion between th and f e.g. in Selfe,\r\nwhich appears to represent a personal name Seleth, probably from\r\nAnglo-Sax, saelth, bliss.  Perhaps also in Fripp for Thripp, a variant\r\nof Thrupp, for Thorp.  Bickerstaffe is the name of a place in\r\nLancashire, of which the older form appears in Bickersteth, and the\r\nlocal name Throgmorton is spelt by Camden Frogmorton, just as Pepys\r\ninvariably writes Queenhive for Queenhythe.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the commoner phenomena to be noticed in connection\r\nwith the spelling and sound of our names.  The student must always\r\nbear in mind that our surnames date from a period when nearly the\r\nwhole population was uneducated.  Their modern forms depend on all\r\nsorts of circumstances, such as local dialect, time of adoption,\r\nsuccessive fashions in pronunciation and the taste and fancy of the\r\nspeller.  They form part of our language, that is, of a living and\r\never-changing organism.  Some of us are old enough to remember the\r\nconfusion between initial v and w which prompted the judge's question\r\nto Mr. Weller.  The vulgar i for a, as in \"tike the kike,\" has been\r\nevolved within comparatively recent times, as well as the loss of\r\nfinal -g, \"shootin and huntin,\" in sporting circles.  In the word\r\nwarmint--\r\n\r\n\"What were you brought up to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"A warmint, dear boy\"\r\n\r\n(Great Expectations, ch. xl.),\r\n\r\nwe have three phonetic phenomena, all of which have influenced the\r\nform and sound of modern surnames, e.g. in Winter, sometimes for\r\nVinter, i.e. vintner, Clark for Clerk, and Bryant for Bryan; and\r\nsimilar changes have been in progress all through the history of our\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be remarked that the personal and accidental\r\nelement, which has so much to do with the development of surnames,\r\nreleases this branch of philology to some extent from the iron rule of\r\nthe phonetician.  Of this the preceding pages give examples.  The\r\nname, not being subject as other words are to a normalizing influence,\r\nis easily affected by the traditional or accidental spelling.\r\nOtherwise Fry would be pronounced Free.  The o is short in Robin and\r\nlong in Probyn, and yet the names are the same (Chapter VI).  Sloper\r\nand Smoker mean a maker of slops and smocks respectively, and Smale is\r\nan archaic spelling of Small, the modern vowel being in each case\r\nlengthened by the retention of an archaic spelling.  The late\r\nProfessor Skeat rejects Bardsley's identification of Waring with Old\r\nFr. Garin or Warin, because the original vowel and the suffix are both\r\ndifferent.  But Mainwaring, which is undoubtedly from mesnil-Warin\r\n(Chapter XIV), shows Bardsley to be right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. BROWN, JONES, AND ROBINSON\r\n\r\n\"Talbots and Stanleys, St. Maurs and such-like folk, have led armies\r\nand made laws time out of mind; but those noble families would be\r\nsomewhat astonished-if the accounts ever came to be fairly taken-to\r\nfind how small their work for England has been by the side of that of\r\nthe Browns.\"  (Tom Brown's Schooldays, ch. i.)\r\n\r\nBrown, Jones, and Robinson have usurped in popular speech positions\r\nproperly belonging to Smith, Jones and Williams.  But the high\r\nposition of Jones and Williams is due to the Welsh, who, replacing a\r\nstring of Aps by a simple genitive at a comparatively recent date,\r\nhave given undue prominence to a few very common names; cf. Davies,\r\nEvans, etc.  If we consider only purely English names, the triumvirate\r\nwould be Smith, Taylor, and Brown.  Thus, of our three commonest\r\nnames, the first two are occupative and the third is a nickname.\r\nFrench has no regular equivalent, though Dupont and Durand are\r\nsometimes used in this way--\r\n\r\n\"Si Chateaubriand avait eu nom Durand ou Dupont, qui sait si son Génie\r\ndu Christianisme n'eût point passé pour une capucinade?\"\r\n\r\n(F. Brunetiére.)\r\n\r\nThe Germans speak of Müller, Meyer and Schulze, all rural names, and\r\nit is perhaps characteristic that two of them are official.  Meyer is\r\nan early loan from Lat. major, and appears to have originally meant\r\nsomething like overseer.  Later on it acquired the meaning of farmer,\r\nin its proper sense of one who farms, i.e. manages on a profit-sharing\r\nsystem, the property of another.  It is etymologically the same as our\r\nMayor, Mair, etc.  Schulze, a village magistrate, is cognate with Ger.\r\nSchuld, debt, and our verb shall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIVE NAMES\r\n\r\nTaking the different classes of surnames separately, the six commonest\r\noccupative names are Smith, Taylor, Clark, Wright, Walker, Turner.  If\r\nwe exclude Clark, as being more often a nickname for the man who could\r\nread and write, the sixth will be Cooper, sometimes spelt Cowper.\r\n\r\nThe commanding position of Smith is due to the fact that it was\r\napplied to all workers in every kind of metal.  The modern Smiths no\r\ndoubt include descendants of medieval blacksmiths, whitesmiths,\r\nbladesmiths, locksmiths, and many others, but the compounds are not\r\ncommon as surnames.  We find, however, Shoosmith, Shearsmith, and\r\nNasmyth, the last being more probably for earlier Knysmith, i.e.\r\nknife-smith, than for nail-smith, which was supplanted by Naylor.\r\nGrossmith I guess to be an accommodated form of the Ger. Grobschmied,\r\nblacksmith, lit.  rough smith, and Goldsmith is very often a Jewish\r\nname for Ger. Goldschmid.\r\n\r\nWright, obsolete perhaps as a trade name, has given many compounds,\r\nincluding Arkwright, a maker of bins, or arks as they were once\r\ncalled, Tellwright, a tile maker, and many others which need no\r\ninterpretation.  The high position of Taylor is curious, for there\r\nwere other names for the trade, such as Seamen, Shapster, Parmenter\r\n(Chapter XVIII), and neither Tailleur nor Letailleur are particularly\r\ncommon in French.  The explanation is that this name has absorbed the\r\nmedieval Teler and Teller, weaver, ultimately belonging to Lat. tela,\r\na web;--cf. the very common Fr. Tellier and Letellier.  In some cases\r\nalso the Mid. Eng. teygheler, Tyler, has been swallowed up.  Walker,\r\ni.e. trampler, meant a cloth fuller, but another origin has helped to\r\nswell the numbers of the clan--\r\n\r\n\"Walkers are such as are otherwise called foresters.  They are\r\nforesters assigned by the King, who are walkers within a certain space\r\nof ground assigned to their care\" (Cowel's Interpreter).\r\n\r\nCooper, a derivative of Lat. cupa or cuppa, a vessel, is cognate with\r\nthe famous French name Cuvier, which has given our Cover, though this\r\nmay also be for coverer, i.e. tiler (Chapter XV).\r\n\r\nOf occupative names which have also an official meaning, the three\r\ncommonest are Ward, Bailey, and Marshall.  Ward, originally abstract,\r\nis the same word as Fr. garde.  Bailey, Old Fr. bailif (bailli),\r\nranges from a Scottish magistrate to a man in possession.  It is\r\nrelated to bail and to bailey, a ward in a fortress, as in Old Bailey.\r\nBayliss may come from the Old French nominative bailis (Chapter I), or\r\nmay be formed like Parsons, etc. (Chapter XV).  Marshall (Chapter XX)\r\nmay stand for a great commander or a shoeing-smith, still called\r\nfarrier-marshal in the army.  The first syllable is cognate with mare\r\nand the second means servant.  Constable, Lat. comes stabuli,\r\nstableman, has a similar history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF NAMES\r\n\r\nThe commonest local names naturally include none taken from particular\r\nplaces.  The three commonest are Hall, Wood and Green, from residence\r\nby the great house, the wood, and the village green.  Cf. the French\r\nnames Lasalle, Dubois, Dupré.  Hall is sometimes for Hale (Chapter\r\nII), and its Old French translation is one source of Sale.  Next to\r\nthese come Hill, Moore, and Shaw (Chapter XII); but Lee would probably\r\ncome among the first if all its variants were taken into account\r\n(Chapter III).\r\n\r\nOf baptismal names used unaltered as surnames the six commonest are\r\nThomas, Lewis, Martin, James, Morris, Morgan.  Here again the Welsh\r\nelement is strong, and four of these names, ending in -s, belong also\r\nto the next group, i.e. the class of surnames formed from the genitive\r\nof baptismal names.  The frequent occurrence of Lewis is partly due to\r\nits being adopted as a kind of translation of the Welsh Llewellyn, but\r\nthe name is often a disguised Jewish Levi, and has nearly absorbed the\r\nlocal Lewes.  Next to the above come Allen, Bennett, Mitchell, all of\r\nFrench introduction.  Mitchell may have been reinforced by Mickle, the\r\nnorthern for Bigg.  It is curious that these particularly common\r\nnames, Martin, Allen, Bennett (Benedict), Mitchell (Michael), have\r\nformed comparatively few derivatives and are generally found in their\r\nunaltered form.  Three of them are from famous saints' names, while\r\nAllen, a Breton name which came in with the Conquest, has probably\r\nabsorbed to some extent the Anglo-Saxon name Alwin (Chapter VII).\r\nMartin is in some cases an animal nickname, the marten.  Among the\r\ngenitives Jones, Williams, and Davi(e)s lead easily, followed by\r\nEvans, Roberts, and Hughes, all Welsh in the main.  Among the twelve\r\ncommonest names of this class those that are not preponderantly Welsh\r\nare Roberts, Edwards, Harris, Phillips, and Rogers.  Another Welsh\r\npatronymic, Price (Chapter VI), is among the fifty commonest English\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThe classification of names in -son raises the difficult question as\r\nto whether Jack represents Fr. Jacques, or whether it comes from\r\nJankin, Jenkin, dim. of John.  [Footnote: See E. B. Nicholson, The\r\nPedigree of Jack.]\r\n\r\nTaking Johnson and Jackson as separate names, we get the order\r\nJohnson, Robinson, Wilson, Thompson, Jackson, Harrison.  The variants\r\nof Thompson might put it a place or two higher.  Names in -kins\r\n(Distribution of names, Chapter IV), though very numerous in some\r\nregions, are not so common as those in the above classes.  It would be\r\nhard to say which English font-name has given the largest number of\r\nfamily names.  In Chapter V. will be found some idea of the\r\nbewildering and multitudinous forms they assume.  It has been\r\ncalculated, I need hardly say by a German professor, that the possible\r\nnumber of derivatives from one given name is 6, 000, but fortunately\r\nmost of the seeds are abortive.\r\n\r\nOf nicknames Brown, Clark, and White are by far the commonest.  Then\r\ncomes King, followed by the two adjectival nicknames Sharp and Young.\r\n\r\nThe growth of towns and facility of communication are now bringing\r\nabout such a general movement that most regions would accept Brown,\r\nJones and Robinson as fairly typical names.  But this was not always\r\nso.  Brown is still much commoner in the north than in the south, and\r\nat one time the northern Johnson and Robinson contrasted with the\r\nsouthern Jones and Roberts, the latter being of comparatively modern\r\norigin in Wales (Chapter IV).  Even now, if we take the farmer class,\r\nour nomenclature is largely regional, and the directories even of our\r\ngreat manufacturing towns represent to a great extent the medieval\r\npopulation of the rural district around them.  [Footnote: See Guppy,\r\nHomes of Family Names.] The names Daft and Turney, well known in\r\nNottingham, appear in the county in the Hundred Rolls.  Cheetham, the\r\nname of a place now absorbed in Manchester, is as a surname ten times\r\nmore numerous there than in London, and the same is true of many\r\ncharacteristic north-country names, such as the Barraclough,\r\nMurgatroyd, and Sugden of Charlotte Brontë's Shirley.  The\r\ntransference of Murgatroyd (Chapter XII) to Cornwall, in Gilbert and\r\nSullivan's Ruddigore, must have been part of the intentional\r\ntopsy-turvydom in which those two bright spirits delighted.\r\n\r\nDiminutives in -kin, from the Old Dutch suffix -ken, are still found\r\nin greatest number on the east coast that faces Holland, or in Wales,\r\nwhere they were introduced by the Flemish weavers who settled in\r\nPembrokeshire in the reign of Henry I.  It is in the border counties,\r\nCheshire, Shropshire, Hereford, and Monmouth, that we find the old\r\nWelsh names such as Gough, Lloyd, Onion (Enion), Vaughan (Chapter\r\nXXII).  The local Gape, an opening in the cliffs, is pretty well\r\nconfined to Norfolk, and Puddifoot belongs to Bucks and the adjacent\r\ncounties as it did in 1273.  The hall changes hands as one conquering\r\nrace succeeds another--\r\n\r\n\"Where is Bohun?  Where is de Vere?  The lawyer, the farmer, the silk\r\nmercer, lies perdu under the coronet, and winks to the antiquary to\r\nsay nothing\" (Emerson, English Traits),\r\n\r\nbut the hut keeps its ancient inhabitants.  The descendant of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon serf who cringed to Front de Boeuf now makes way\r\nrespectfully for Isaac of York's motor, perhaps on the very spot where\r\nhis own fierce ancestor first exchanged the sword for the ploughshare\r\nlong before Alfred's day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE ABSORPTION OF FOREIGN NAMES\r\n\r\n\"I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,\r\nthough not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who\r\nsettled first at Hull.  He got a good estate by merchandize, and\r\nleaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he\r\nmarried my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good\r\nfamily in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson\r\nKreutznaer; but by the usual corruption of words in English, we are\r\nnow called--nay, we call ourselves and write our name--Crusoe\" (Robinson\r\nCrusoe, ch. i.).\r\n\r\nAny student of our family nomenclature must be struck by the fact that\r\nthe number of foreign names now recognizable in England is out of all\r\nproportion to the immense number which must have been introduced at\r\nvarious periods of our history.  Even the expert, who is often able to\r\ndetect the foreign name in its apparently English garb, cannot rectify\r\nthis disproportion for us.  The number of names of which the present\r\nform can be traced back to a foreign origin is inconsiderable when\r\ncompared with the much larger number assimilated and absorbed by the\r\nAnglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOTS\r\n\r\nThe great mass of those names of French or Flemish origin which do not\r\ndate back to the Conquest or to medieval times are due to the\r\nimmigration of Protestant refugees in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies.  It is true that many names for which Huguenot ancestry is\r\nclaimed were known in England long before the Reformation.  Thus,\r\nBulteel is the name of a refugee family which came from Tournay about\r\nthe year 1600, but the same name is found in the Hundred Rolls Of\r\n1273.  The Grubbe family, according to Burke, came from Germany about\r\n1450, after the Hussite persecution; but we find the name in England\r\ntwo centuries earlier, \"without the assistance of a foreign\r\npersecution to make it respectable\" (Bardsley, Dictionary of English\r\nSurnames).  The Minet family is known to be of Huguenot origin, but\r\nthe same name also figures in the medieval Rolls.  The fact is that\r\nthere was all through the Middle Ages a steady immigration of\r\nforeigners, whether artisans, tradesmen, or adventurers, some of whose\r\nnames naturally reappear among the Huguenots.  On several occasions\r\nlarge bodies of Continental workmen, skilled in special trades, were\r\nbrought into the country by the wise policy of the Government.  Like\r\nthe Huguenots later on, they were protected by the State and\r\npersecuted by the populace, who resented their habits of industry and\r\nsobriety.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period of the religious troubles in France and\r\nFlanders, starting from the middle of the sixteenth century, refugees\r\nwere reaching this country in a steady stream; but after the\r\nRevocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) they arrived in thousands,\r\nand the task of providing for them and helping on their absorption\r\ninto the population became a serious problem.  Among the better class\r\nof these immigrants was to be found the flower of French intellect and\r\nenterprise, and one has only to look through an Army or Navy list, or\r\nto notice the names which are prominent in the Church, at the Bar, and\r\nin the higher walks of industry and commerce, to realize the madness\r\nof Louis XIV. and the wisdom of the English Government.\r\n\r\nHere are a few taken at random from Smiles's History of the\r\nHuguenots--Bosanquet, Casaubon, Chenevix Trench, Champion de Crespigny,\r\nDalbiac, Delane, Dollond, Durand, Fonblanque, Gambier, Garrick,\r\nLayard, Lefanu, Lefroy, Ligonier, Luard, Martineau, Palairet, Perowne,\r\nPlimsoll, Riou, Romilly--all respectable and many distinguished, even\r\ncricket being represented.  These more educated foreigners usually\r\nkept their names, sometimes with slight modifications which do not\r\nmake them unrecognizable.  Thus, Bouverie, literally \"ox-farm,\" is\r\ngenerally found in its unaltered form, though the London Directory has\r\nalso examples of the perverted Buffery.  But the majority of the\r\nimmigrants were of the artisan class and illiterate.  This explains\r\nthe extraordinary disappearance, in the course of two centuries, of\r\nthe thousands of French names which were introduced between 1550 and\r\n1700.\r\n\r\nWe have many official lists of these foreigners, and in these lists we\r\ncatch the foreign name in the very act of transforming itself into\r\nEnglish.  This happens sometimes by translation, e.g. Poulain became\r\nColt, Poisson was reincarnated as Fish, and a refugee bearing the\r\nsomewhat uncommon name Petitoeil transformed himself into Little-eye,\r\nwhich became in a few generations Lidley.  But comparatively few\r\nsurnames were susceptible of such simple treatment, and in the great\r\nmajority of cases the name underwent a more or less arbitrary\r\nperversion which gave it a more English physiognomy.  Especially\r\ninteresting from this point of view is the list of--\"Straungers\r\nresiding and dwellinge within the city of London and the liberties\r\nthereof,\" drawn up in 1618.  The names were probably taken down by the\r\nofficials of the different wards, who, differing themselves in\r\nintelligence and orthography, produced very curious results.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the Christian name is translated, while the surname is\r\neither assimilated to some English form or perverted according to the\r\ntaste and fancy of the individual constable.  Thus, John Garret, a\r\nDutchman, is probably Jan Gerard, and James Flower, a milliner, born\r\nin Rouen, is certainly Jaques Fleur, or Lafleur.  John de Cane and\r\nPeter le Cane are Jean Duquesne and Pierre Lequesne (Norman quêne,\r\noak), though the former may also have come from Caen.  John Buck, from\r\nRouen, is Jean Bouc, and Abraham Bushell, from Rochelle, was probably\r\na Roussel or Boissel.  James King and John Hill, both Dutchmen, are\r\nobvious translations of common Dutch names, while Henry Powell, a\r\nGerman, is Heinrich Paul.  Mary Peacock, from Dunkirk, and John\r\nBonner, a Frenchman, I take to be Marie Picot and Jean Bonheur, while\r\nNicholas Bellow is surely Nicolas Belleau.  Michael Leman, born in\r\nBrussels, may be French Leman or Lemoine, or perhaps German Lehmann.\r\n\r\nTo each alien's name is appended that of the monarch whose subject he\r\ncalls himself, but a republic is outside the experience of one\r\nconstable, who leaves an interrogative blank after Cristofer Switcher,\r\nborn at Swerick (Zürich) in Switcherland.  The surname so ingeniously\r\ncreated appears to have left no pedagogic descendants.  In some cases\r\nthe harassed Bumble has lost patience, and substituted a plain English\r\nname for foreign absurdity.  To the brain which christened Oliver\r\nTwist we owe Henry Price, a subject of the King of Poland, Lewis\r\nJackson, a \"Portingall,\" and Alexander Faith, a steward to the Venice\r\nAmbassador, born in the dukedom of Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERVERSIONS OF FOREIGN NAMES\r\n\r\nIn the returns made outside the bounds of the city proper the aliens\r\nhave added their own signatures, or in some cases made their marks.\r\nJacob Alburtt signs himself as Jacob Elbers, and Croft Castell as\r\nKraft Kassels.  Harman James is the official translation of Hermann\r\nJacobs, Mary Miller of Marija Moliner, and John Young of Jan le Jeune.\r\nGyllyam Spease, for Wilbert Spirs, seems to be due to a Welsh\r\nconstable, and Chrystyan Wyhelhames, for Cristian Welselm, looks like\r\na conscientious attempt at Williams.  One registrar, with a phonetic\r\nsystem of his own, has transformed the Dutch Moll into the more\r\nfamiliar Maule, and has enriched his list with Jannacay Yacopes for\r\nJantje Jacobs.  Lowe Luddow, who signs himself Louij Ledou, seems to\r\nbe Louis Ledoux.  An alien who writes himself Jann Eisankraott (Ger.\r\nEisenkraut?  ) cannot reasonably complain plain at being transformed\r\ninto John Isacrocke, but the substitution of John Johnson for Jansen\r\nVandrusen suggests that this individual's case was taken at the end of\r\na long day's work.\r\n\r\nThese examples, taken at random, show how the French and Flemish names\r\nof the humbler refugees lost their foreign appearance.  In many cases\r\nthe transformation was etymologically justified.  Thus, some of our\r\nDruitts and Drewetts may be descended from Martin Druett, the first\r\nname on the list.  But this is probably the common French name Drouet\r\nor Drouot, assimilated to the English Druitt, which we find in 1273.\r\nAnd both are diminutives of Drogo, which occurs in Domesday Book, and\r\nis, through Old French, the origin of our Drew.  But in many cases the\r\nname has been so deformed that one can only guess at the continental\r\noriginal.  I should conjecture, for instance, that the curious name\r\nShoppee is a corruption of Chappuis, the Old French for a carpenter,\r\nand that\r\n\r\nJacob Shophousey, registered as a German cutler, came from\r\nSchaffhausen.  In this particular region of English nomenclature a\r\nlittle guessing is almost excusable.  The law of probabilities makes\r\nit mathematically certain that the horde of immigrants included\r\nrepresentatives of all the very common French family names, and it\r\nwould be strange if Chappuis were absent.\r\n\r\nThis process of transformation is still going on in a small way,\r\nespecially in our provincial manufacturing towns, in which most large\r\ncommercial undertakings have slipped from the nerveless grasp of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon into the more capable and prehensile fingers of the\r\nforeigner--\r\n\r\n\"Hilda then learnt that Mrs.  Gailey had married a French modeller\r\nnamed Canonges. . .  and that in course of time the modeller had\r\ninformally changed the name to Cannon, because no one in the five\r\ntowns could pronounce the true name rightly.\"\r\n\r\n(Arnold Bennett, Hilda Lessways, i.  5.)\r\n\r\nThis occurs most frequently in the case of Jewish names of German\r\norigin.  Thus, Löwe becomes Lowe or Lyons, Meyer is transformed into\r\nMyers, Goldschmid into Goldsmith, Kohn into Cowan, Levy into Lee or\r\nLewis, Salamon into Salmon, Hirsch or Hertz into Hart, and so on.\r\nSometimes a bolder flight is attempted--\r\n\r\n\"Leopold Norfolk Gordon had a house in Park Lane, and ever so many\r\npeople's money to keep it up with.  As may be guessed from his name,\r\nhe was a Jew.\"\r\n\r\n(Morley Roberts, Lady Penelope, ch. ii.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWISH NAMES\r\n\r\nThe Jewish names of German origin which are now so common in England\r\nmostly date from the beginning of the nineteenth century, when laws\r\nwere passed in Austria, Prussia and Bavaria to compel all Jewish\r\nfamilies to adopt a fixed surname.  Many of them chose personal names,\r\ne.g. Jakobs, Levy, Moses, for this purpose, while others named\r\nthemselves from their place of residence, e.g. Cassel, Speyer\r\n(Spires), Hamburg, often with the addition of the syllable -er, e.g.\r\nDarmesteter, Homburger.  Some families preferred descriptive names\r\nsuch as Selig (Chapter XXII), Sonnenschein, Goldmann, or invented\r\npoetic and gorgeous place-names such as Rosenberg, Blumenthal,\r\nGoldberg, Lilienfeld.  The oriental fancy also showed itself in such\r\nnames as Edelstein, jewel, Glueckstein, luck stone, Rubinstein, ruby,\r\nGoldenkranz, golden wreath, etc. [Footnote: Our Touchstone would seem\r\nalso to be a nickname.  The obituary of a Mr. Touchstone appeared in\r\nthe Manchester Guardian, December 12, 1912.] It is owing to the\r\nexistence of the last two groups that our fashionable intelligence is\r\nnow often so suggestive of a wine-list.  Among animal names adopted\r\nthe favourites were Adler, eagle, Hirsch, hart, Löwe, lion, and Wolf,\r\neach of which is used with symbolic significance in the Old Testament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. TOM, DICK AND HARRY\r\n\r\n\"Watte vocat, cui Thomme venit, neque Symme retardat,\r\n  Betteque, Gibbe simul, Hykke venire jubent;\r\nColle furit, quem Geffe juvat nocumenta parantes,\r\n  Cum quibus ad dampnum Wille coire vovet.\r\nGrigge rapit, dum Dawe strepit, comes est quibus Hobbe,\r\n  Lorkyn et in medio non minor esse putat:\r\nHudde ferit, quem Judde terit, dum Tebbe minatur,\r\n  Jakke domosque viros vellit et ense necat.\"\r\n\r\n(GOWER, On Wat Tyler's Rebellion.)\r\n\r\nGower's lines on the peasant rebels give us some idea of the names\r\nwhich were most popular in the fourteenth century, and which have\r\nconsequently impressed themselves most strongly on our modern\r\nsurnames.  It will be noticed that one member of the modern\r\ntriumvirate, Harry, or Hal, is absent.  [Footnote: The three names\r\nwere not definitely established till the nineteenth century.  Before\r\nthat period they had rivals.  French says Pierre et Paul, and German\r\nHeinz and Kunz, i.e. Heinrich and Conrad.] The great popularity of\r\nthis name probably dates from a rather later period and is connected\r\nwith the exploits of Henry V. Moreover, all the names, with the\r\npossible exception of Hud, are of French introduction and occur rarely\r\nbefore the Conquest.  The old Anglo-Saxon names did survive,\r\nespecially in the remoter parts of the country, and have given us many\r\nsurnames (see ch. vii.), but even in the Middle Ages people had a\r\npreference for anything that came over with the Conqueror.  French\r\nnames are nearly all of German origin, the Celtic names and the Latin\r\nnames which encroached on them having been swept away by the Frankish\r\ninvasion, a parallel to the wholesale adoption of Norman names in\r\nEngland.  Thus our name Harvey, no longer usual as a font-name, is Fr.\r\nHerod, which represents the heroic German name Herewig, to the second\r\nsyllable of which belongs such an apparently insignificant name as\r\nWigg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL FONT-NAMES\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of Latin names is not to be regretted, for the Latin\r\nnomenclature was of the most unimaginative description, while the Old\r\nGerman names are more like those of Greece; e.g. Ger. Ludwig, which\r\nhas passed into most of the European languages (Louis, Lewis,\r\nLudovico, etc), is from Old High Ger. hlut-wig, renowned in fight,\r\nequivalent to the Greek Clytomachus, with one-half of which it is\r\netymologically cognate.\r\n\r\nSome of the names in Gower's list, e.g. Watte (Chapter I), Thomme,\r\nSymme, Geffe (Chapter VI), Wille, Jakke, are easily recognized.  Bette\r\nis for Bat, Bartholomew, a name, which has given Batty, Batten, Bates,\r\nBartle (cf. Bartlemas), Bartlett, Badcock, Batcock.  But this group of\r\nnames belongs also to the Bert- or -bent, which is so common in\r\nTeutonic names, such as Bertrand, Bertram, Herbert, Hubert, many of\r\nwhich reached us in an Old French form.  For the loss of the _r_, cf.\r\nMatty from Martha.  Gibe is for Gilbert.  Hick is rimed on Dick:\r\n(Chapter VI).  Colle is for Nicolas.  Grig is for Gregory, whence\r\nGregson and Scottish Grier.  Dawe, for David, alternated with Day and\r\nDow, which appear as first element in many surnames, though Day has\r\nanother origin (Chapter XIX) and Dowson sometimes belongs to the\r\nfemale name Douce, sweet.  Hobbe is a rimed form from Robert.  Lorkyn,\r\nor Larkin, is for Lawrence, for which we also find Law, Lay, and Low,\r\nwhence Lawson, Lakin, Lowson, Locock, etc.  For Hudde see Chapters I,\r\nVII.  Judde, from the very popular Jordan, has given Judson, Judkins,\r\nand the contracted Jukes.  Jordan (Fr. Jourdain, Ital. Giordano) seems\r\nto have been adopted as a personal name in honour of John the Baptist.\r\nTebbe is for Theobald (Chapter I).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMONEST FONT-NAMES\r\n\r\nMany people, in addressing a small boy with whom they are\r\nunacquainted, are in the habit of using Tommy as a name to which any\r\nsmall boy should naturally answer.  In some parts of Polynesia the\r\nnatives speak of a white Mary or a black Mary, i.e. woman, just as the\r\nWalloons round Mons speak of Marie bon bec, a shrew, Marie grognon, a\r\nMrs.  Gummidge, Marie quatre langues, a chatterbox, and several other\r\nMaries still less politely described.  We have the modern silly Johnny\r\nfor the older silly Billy, while Jack Pudding is in German Hans Wurst,\r\nJohn Sausage.  Only the very commonest names are used in this way,\r\nand, if we had no further evidence, the rustic Dicky bird, Robin\r\nredbreast, Hob goblin, Tom tit, Will o' the Wisp, Jack o' lantern,\r\netc., would tell us which have been in the past the most popular\r\nEnglish font-names.  During the Middle Ages there was a kind of race\r\namong half a dozen favourite names, the prevailing order being John,\r\nWilliam, Thomas, Richard, Robert, with perhaps Hugh as sixth.\r\n\r\nNow, for each of these there is a reason.  John, a favourite name in\r\nso many languages (Jean, Johann, Giovanni, Juan, Ian, Ivan, etc.), as\r\nthe name of the Baptist and of the favoured disciple, defied even the\r\nunpopularity of our one King of that name.  The special circumstances\r\nattending the birth and naming of the Baptist probably supplied the\r\nchief factor in its triumph.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the Conquest William led easily.  We usually\r\nadopted the W- form from the north-east of France, but Guillaume has\r\nalso supplied a large number of surnames in Gil-, which have got\r\ninextricably mixed up with those derived from Gilbert, Gillian\r\n(Juliana), and Giles.  Gilman represents the French dim. Guillemin,\r\nthe local-looking Gilliam is simply Guillaume, and Wilmot corresponds\r\nto Fr. Guillemot.\r\n\r\nThe doubting disciple held a very insignificant place until the shrine\r\nof St. Thomas of Canterbury became one of the holy places of\r\nChristendom.  To Thomas belong Macey, Massie, and Masson, dims.  of\r\nFrench aphetic forms, but the first two are also from Old French forms\r\nof Matthew, and Masson is sometimes an alternative form of Mason.\r\n\r\nRobert and Richard were both popular Norman names.  The first was\r\ngreatly helped by Robin Hood and the second by the Lion-Heart.\r\n\r\nThe name Hugh was borne by several saints, the most famous of whom in\r\nEngland was the child-martyr, St. Hugh of Lincoln, said to have been\r\nmurdered by the Jews C. 1250.  It had a dim. Huggin and also the forms\r\nHew and How, whence Hewett, Hewlett, Howitt, Howlett, etc., while from\r\nthe French dim. Huchon we get Hutchin and its derivatives, and also\r\nHouchin.  Hugh also appears in the rather small class of names\r\nrepresented by Littlejohn, Meiklejohn, etc. [Footnote: This formation\r\nseems to be much commoner in French.  In the \"Bottin\" I find\r\nGrandblaise, Grandcollot (Nicolas), Grandgeorge, Grandgérard,\r\nGrandguillaume, Grandguillot, Grandjacques, Grand-jean, Grandperrin\r\n(Pierre), Grandpierre, Grandremy, Grandvincent, and Petitcolin,\r\nPetitdemange (Dominique), Petitdidier (Desiderius), Petit-Durand,\r\nPetit-Etienne (Stephen), Petit-Gérard, Petit-Huguenin, Petitjean,\r\nPetitperrin, Petit-Richard.]  We find Goodhew, Goodhue.  Cf.\r\nGaukroger, i.e. awkward Roger, and Goodwillie.  But the more usual\r\norigin of Goodhew, Goodhue is from Middle Eng. heave, servant, hind.\r\nCf. Goodhind.\r\n\r\nMost of the other names in Gower's list have been prolific.  We might\r\nadd to them Roger, whence Hodge and Dodge, Humfrey, which did not lend\r\nitself to many variations, and Peter, from the French form of which we\r\nhave many derivatives (Chapter III), including perhaps the Huguenot\r\nPerowne, Fr. Perron, but this can also be local, du Perron, the\r\netymology, Lat. Petra, rock, remaining the same.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the great names Alfred [Footnote: The name Alured is\r\ndue to misreading of the older Alvred, v being written u in old MSS.\r\nAllfrey is from the Old French form of the name.]  and Edward is not\r\nsurprising, as they belonged to the conquered race.  Though Edward was\r\nrevived as the name of a long line of Kings, its contribution to\r\nsurnames has been small, most names in Ed-, Ead-, e.g. Ede, Eden,\r\nEdison, Edkins, Eady, etc., belonging rather to the once popular\r\nfemale name Eda or to Edith, though in some cases they are from Edward\r\nor other Anglo-Saxon names having the same initial syllable.  James is\r\na rare name in medieval rolls, being represented by Jacob, and no\r\ndoubt partly by Jack (Chapter IV).  It is--\r\n\r\n\"Wrested from Jacob, the same as Jago [Footnote: Jago is found, with\r\nother Spanish names, in Cornwall; cf. Bastian or Baste, for\r\nSebastian.]  in Spanish, Jaques in French; which some Frenchified\r\nEnglish, to their disgrace, have too much affected\" (Camden).\r\n\r\nIt appears in Gimson, Jemmett, and the odd-looking Gem, while its\r\nFrench form is somewhat disguised in Jeakes and Jex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFASHIONS IN FONT-NAMES\r\n\r\nThe force of royal example is seen in the popularity under the Angevin\r\nkings of Henry, or Harry, Geoffrey and Fulk, the three favourite names\r\nin that family.  For Harry see Chapter III.  Geoffrey, from Ger.\r\nGottfried, Godfrey, has given us a large number of names in Geff-,\r\nJeff-, and Giff-, Jiff-, and probably also Jebb, Gepp and Jepson,\r\nwhile to Fulk we owe Fewkes, Foakes, Fowkes, Vokes, etc., and perhaps\r\nin some cases Fox.  But it is impossible to catalogue all the popular\r\nmedieval font-names.  Many others will be found scattered through this\r\nbook as occasion or association suggests them.\r\n\r\nThree names whose poor representation is surprising are Arthur,\r\nCharles and George, the two great Kings of medieval romance and the\r\npatron saint of Merrie England.  All three are fairly common in their\r\nunaltered form, and we find also Arter for Arthur.  But they have\r\ngiven few derivatives, though Atkins, generally from Ad-, i.e. Adam,\r\nmay sometimes be from Arthur (cf. Bat for Bart, Matty for Martha,\r\netc.).  Arthur is a rare medieval font-name, a fact no doubt due to\r\nthe sad fate of King John's nephew.  Its modern popularity dates from\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, while Charles and George were raised from\r\nobscurity by the Stuarts and the Brunswicks.  To these might be added\r\nthe German name Frederick, the spread of which was due to the fame of\r\nFrederick the Great.  It gave, however, in French the dissimilated\r\nFerry, one source of our surnames Ferry, Ferris, though the former is\r\ngenerally local.  [Footnote: \"For Frideric, the English have commonly\r\nused Frery and Fery, which hath been now a long time a Christian name\r\nin the ancient family of Tilney, and lucky to their house, as they\r\nreport.\" (Camden.)]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we take from Gower's list a name which is\r\nto-day comparatively rare, e.g. Gilbert, we find it represented by a\r\nwhole string of surnames, e.g. Gilbart, Gibbs, Gibson, Gibbon,\r\nGibbins, Gipps, Gipson, to mention only the most familiar.  From the\r\nFrench dim. Gibelot we get the rather rare Giblett; cf. Hewlett for\r\nHew-el-et, Hamlet for Ham-el-et (Hamo), etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDERIVATIVES OF FONT-NAMES\r\n\r\nIn forming patronymics from personal names, it is not always the first\r\nsyllable that is selected.  In Toll, Tolley, Tollett, from\r\nBartholomew, the second has survived, while Philpot, dim. of Philip,\r\nhas given Potts.  From Alexander we get Sanders and Saunders.  But,\r\ntaking, for simplicity, two instances in which the first syllable has\r\nsurvived, we shall find plenty of instruction in those two pretty men\r\nRobert and Richard.  We have seen (Chapter VI) that Roger gave Hodge\r\nand Dodge, which, in the derivatives Hodson and Dodson, have coalesced\r\nwith names derived from Odo and the Anglo-Sax. Dodda (Chapter VII).\r\nSimilarly Robert gave Rob, Hob and Dob, and Richard gave Rick, Hick\r\nand Dick.  [Footnote: I believe, however, that Hob is in some cases\r\nfrom Hubert, whence Hubbard, Hibbert, Hobart, etc.] Hob, whence Hobbs,\r\nwas sharpened into Hop, whence Hopps.  The diminutive Hopkin, passing\r\ninto Wales, gave Popkin, just as ap-Robin became Probyn, ap-Hugh Pugh,\r\nap-Owen Bowen, etc.  In the north Dobbs became Dabbs (p. A. Hob also\r\ndeveloped another rimed form Nob cf. to \"hob-nob\" with anyone),\r\nwhence Nobbs and Nabbs, the latter, of course, being sometimes rimed\r\non Abbs, from Abel or Abraham.  Bob is the latest variant and has not\r\nformed many surnames.  Richard has a larger family than Robert, for,\r\nbesides Rick, Hick and Dick, we have Rich and Hitch, Higg and Digg.\r\nThe reader will be able to continue this genealogical tree for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe full or the shortened name can become a surname, either without\r\nchange, or with the addition of the genitive -s or the word -son, the\r\nformer more usual in the south, the latter in the north.  To take a\r\nsimple case, we find as surnames William, Will, Williams, Wills,\r\nWilliamson, Wilson.  [Footnote: This suffix has squeezed out all the\r\nothers, though Alice Johnson is theoretically absurd.  In Mid. English\r\nwe find daughter, father, mother, brother and other terms of\r\nrelationship used in this way, e.g. in 1379, Agnes Dyconwyfdowson, the\r\nwife of Dow's son Dick.  Dawbarn, child of David, is still found.  See\r\nalso Chapter XXI]\r\n\r\nFrom the short form we get diminutives by means of the English\r\nsuffixes -ie or -y (these especially in the north), -kin (Chapter IV),\r\nand the French suffixes -et, -ot (often becoming -at in English), -in,\r\n-on (often becoming -en in English).  Thus Willy, Wilkie, Willett.  I\r\ngive a few examples of surnames formed from each class\r\n\r\nRitchie (Richard), Oddy (Odo, whence also Oates), Lambie (Lambert),\r\nJelley (Julian); [Footnote: Lamb is also, of course, a nickname cf.\r\nAgnew, Fr. agneau]\r\n\r\nDawkins, Dawkes (David), Hawkins, Hawkes (Hal), Gilkins (Geoffrey),\r\nPerkins, Perks (Peter), Rankin (Randolf);\r\n\r\nGillett (Gil, Chapter VI), Collett (Nicholas), Bartlett (Bartholomew),\r\nRicketts (Richard), Marriott, Marryat (Mary), Elliott (Elias, see\r\nChapter IX), Wyatt (Guy), Perrott (Peter);\r\n\r\nCollins (Nicholas), Jennings (John, see Chapter X), Copping (Jacob,\r\nsee Chapter I), Rawlin (Raoul, the French form of Radolf, whence Roll,\r\nRalph, Relf), Paton (Patrick), Sisson (Sirs, i.e. Cecilia), Gibbons\r\n(Gilbert), Beaton (Beatrice).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the suffixes and diminutives already mentioned, we have\r\nthe two rather puzzling endings -man and -cock.  Man occurs as an\r\nending in several Germanic names which are older than the Conquest,\r\ne.g. Ashman, Harman, Coleman; and the simple Mann is also an\r\nAnglo-Saxon personal name.  It is sometimes to be taken literally,\r\ne.g. in Goodman, i.e. master of the house (Matt.  xx. ii), Longman,\r\nYoungman, etc.  In Hickman, Homan (How, Hugh), etc., it may mean\r\nservant of, as in Ladyman, Priestman, or may be merely an augmentative\r\nsuffix.  In Coltman, Runciman, it is occupative, the man in charge of\r\nthe colts, rouncies or nags.  Chaucer's Shipman--\r\n\r\n\"Rood upon a rouncy as he kouthe\" (A. 390).\r\n\r\nIn Bridgeman, Pullman, it means the man who lived near, or had some\r\noffice in connection with, the bridge or pool.  But it is often due to\r\nthe imitative instinct.  Dedman is for the local Debenham, and Lakeman\r\nfor Lakenham, while Wyman represents the old name Wymond, and Bowman\r\nand Beeman are sometimes for the local Beaumont (cf. the pronunciation\r\nof Belvoir).  But the existence in German of the name Bienemann shows\r\nthat Beeman may have meant bee-keeper.  Sloman may be a nickname, but\r\nalso means the man in the slough (Chapter XII), and Godliman is an old\r\nfamiliar spelling of Godalming.  We of course get doubtful cases, e.g.\r\nSandeman may be, as explained by Bardsley, the servant of Alexander\r\n(Chapter VI), but it may equally well represent Mid. Eng. sandeman, a\r\nmessenger, and Lawman, Layman, are rather to be regarded as\r\nderivatives of Lawrence (Chapter VI) than what they appear to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUFFIX -COCK\r\n\r\nMany explanations have been given of the suffix -cock, but I cannot\r\nsay that any of them have convinced me.  Both Cock and the patronymic\r\nCocking are found as early personal names.  The suffix was added to\r\nthe shortened form of font-names, e.g. Alcock (Allen), Hitchcock\r\n(Richard), was apparently felt as a mere diminutive, and took an -s\r\nlike the diminutives in -kin, e.g. Willcocks, Simcox.  In Hedgecock,\r\n'Woodcock, etc., it is of course a nickname.  The modern Cox is one of\r\nour very common names, and the spelling Cock, Cocks, Cox, can be found\r\nrepresenting three generations in the churchyard of Invergowrie, near\r\nDundee.\r\n\r\nThe two names Bawcock and Meacock had once a special significance.\r\nPistol, urged to the breach by Fluellen, replies\r\n\r\n\"Good bawcock, bate thy rage!  use lenity, sweet chuck\"\r\n\r\n(Henry V., iii, 2);\r\n\r\nand Petruchio, pretending that his first interview with Katherine has\r\nbeen most satisfactory, says--\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a world to see\r\nHow tame, when men and women are alone,\r\nA meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.\"\r\n\r\n(Taming of the Shrew, ii.1.)\r\n\r\nThese have been explained as Fr. beau coq, which is possible, and meek\r\ncock, which is absurd.  As both words are found as surnames before\r\nShakespeare's time, it is probable that they are diminutives which\r\nwere felt as suited to receive a special connotation, just as a man\r\nwho treats his thirst generously is vulgarly called a Lushington.\r\nBawcock can easily be connected with Baldwin, while Meacock, Maycock,\r\nbelong to the personal name May or Mee, shortened from the Old Fr.\r\nMahieu (Chapter IX).\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not dealing with Celtic names, a few words as to the\r\nScottish, Irish, and Welsh surnames which we find in our directories\r\nmay be useful.  Those of Celtic origin are almost invariably\r\npatronymics.  The Scottish and Irish Mac, son, used like the Anglo-Fr.\r\nFitz-, ultimately means kin, and is related to the -mough of Watmough\r\n(Chapter XXI) and to the word maid.  In MacNab, son of the abbot, and\r\nMacPherson, son of the parson, we have curious hybrids.  In Manx\r\nnames, such as Quilliam (Mac William), Killip (Mac Philip), Clucas\r\n(Mac Lucas), we have aphetic forms of Mac.  The Irish 0', grandson,\r\ndescendant, has etymologically the same meaning as Mac, and is related\r\nto the first part of Ger. Oheim, uncle, of Anglo-Sax. eam (see Eames,\r\nChapter XXI), and of Lat. avus, grandfather.  Oe or oye is still used\r\nfor grandchild in Scottish--\r\n\r\n\"There was my daughter's wean, little Eppie Daidle, my oe, ye ken\"\r\n(Heart of Midlothian, ch. iv.).\r\n\r\nThe names of the Lowlands of Scotland are pretty much the same as\r\nthose of northern England, with the addition of a very large French\r\nelement, due to the close historical connection between the two\r\ncountries.  Examples of French names, often much corrupted, are\r\nBethune (Pas de Calais), often corrupted into Beaton, the name of one\r\nof the Queen's Maries, Boswell (Bosville, Seine Inf.), Bruce (Brieux,\r\nOrne), Comyn, Cumming (Comines, Nord), Grant (le grand), Rennie\r\n(René), etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELTIC NAMES\r\n\r\nWelsh Ap or Ab, reduced from an older Map, ultimately cognate with\r\nMac, gives us such names as Probyn, Powell (Howell, Hoel), Price\r\n(Rhys), Pritchard, Prosser (Rosser), Prothero (Roderick), Bedward,\r\nBeddoes (Eddowe), Blood (Lud, Lloyd), Bethell (Ithel), Benyon (Enion),\r\nwhence also Binyon and the local-looking Baynham.  Onion and Onions\r\nare imitative forms of Enion.  Applejohn and Upjohn are corruptions of\r\nAp-john.  The name Floyd, sometimes Flood, is due to the English\r\ninability to grapple with the Welsh Ll--\r\n\r\n\"I am a gentylman and come of Brutes [Brutus'] blood,\r\n My name is ap Ryce, ap Davy, ap Flood.\"\r\n\r\n(Andrew Boorde, Book of the Introduction of Knowledge, ii 7.)\r\n\r\nWhile Welsh names are almost entirely patronymic, Cornish names are\r\nvery largely local.  They are distinguished by the following prefixes\r\nand others of less common occurrence: Caer-, fort, Lan-, church, Pen-,\r\nhill, Pol-, pool, Ros-, heath, Tre-, settlement, e.g. Carthew, Lanyon,\r\nPenruddock, Polwarth, Rosevear, Trethewy.  Sometimes these elements\r\nare found combined, e.g. in Penrose.\r\n\r\nA certain number of Celtic nicknames and occupative names which are\r\nfrequently found in England will be mentioned elsewhere (pp.  173,\r\n216).  In Gilchrist, Christ's servant, Gildea, servant of God,\r\nGillies, servant of Jesus, Gillespie, bishop's servant, Gilmour,\r\nMary's servant, Gilroy, red servant, we have the Highland \"gillie.\"\r\nSuch names were originally preceded by Mac-, e.g. Gilroy is the same\r\nas MacIlroy; cf. MacLean, for Mac-gil-Ian, son of the servant of John.\r\nTo the same class of formation belong Scottish names in Mal-, e.g.\r\nMalcolm, and Irish names in Mul-, e.g. Mulholland, in which the first\r\nelement means tonsured servant, shaveling, and the second is the name\r\nof a saint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. GODERIC AND GODIVA\r\n\r\n\"England had now once more (A.D. 1100) a King born on her own soil, a\r\nQueen of the blood of the hero Eadmund, a King and Queen whose\r\nchildren would trace to AElfred by two descents.  Norman insolence\r\nmocked at the English King and his English Lady under the English\r\nnames of Godric and Godgifu.\" [Footnote: \"Godricum eum, et comparem\r\nGodgivam appellantes\" (William of Malmesbury, Gesta Regum Anglorum).]\r\n\r\n(FREEMAN, Norman Conquest, v. 170.)\r\n\r\nIn dealing with surnames we begin after the Conquest, for the simple\r\nreason that there were no surnames before.  Occasionally an important\r\nperson has come down in history with a nickname, e.g. Edmund\r\nIron-side, Harold Harefoot, Edward the Confessor; but this is\r\nexceptional, and the Anglo-Saxon, as a rule, was satisfied with one\r\nname.  It is probable that very many of the names in use before the\r\nConquest, whether of English or Scandinavian origin, were chosen\r\nbecause of their etymological meaning, e.g. that the name Beornheard\r\n(Bernard, Barnard, Barnett) was given to a boy in the hope that he\r\nwould grow up a warrior strong, just as his sister might be called\r\nAEthelgifu, noble gift.  The formation of these old names is both\r\ninteresting and, like all Germanic nomenclature, poetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF ANGLO-SAXON NAMES\r\n\r\nAs a rule the name consists of two elements, and the number of those\r\nelements which appear with great frequency is rather limited.  Some\r\nthemes occur only in the first half of the name, e.g. Aethel-, whence\r\nAethelstan, later Alston; AElf-, whence AElfgar, now Elgar and Agar\r\n(AEthel- and AElf- soon got confused, so that Allvey, Elvey may\r\nrepresent both AEthelwig and AElfwig, or perhaps in some cases\r\nEaldwig); Cuth-, whence Cuthbeald, now Cobbold [Footnote: This is also\r\nthe origin of Cupples, and probably of Keble and Nibbles.  It shares\r\nCobbett and Cubitt with Cuthbeorht.]; Cyne-, whence Cynebeald now\r\nKimball and Kemble, both of which are also local, Folc-, whence\r\nFolcheard and Folchere, now Folkard and Fulcher; Gund-, whence\r\nGundred, now Gundry and Grundy (Metathesis, Chapter III); Os-, whence\r\nOsbert, Osborn,\r\n\r\nOther themes only occur as the second half of the name.  Such are\r\n-gifu, in Godgifu, i.e. Godiva, whence Goodeve; -lac in Guthlac, now\r\nGoodlake and Goodluck (Chapter XXI); -laf in Deorlaf, now Dearlove;\r\n-wacer in Eoforwacer, now Earwaker.\r\n\r\nOther themes, and perhaps the greater number, may occur indifferently\r\nfirst and second, e.g. beald, god, here, sige, weald, win, wulf or\r\nulf.  Thus we have complete reversals in Beald-wine, whence Baldwin,\r\nand Wine-beald, whence Winbolt, Here-weald, whence Herald, Harold,\r\nHarrod, and Weald-here, whence Walter (Chapter I).  With these we may\r\ncompare Gold-man and Man-gold, the latter of which has given Mangles.\r\nSo also we have Sige-heard, whence Siggers, and Wulf-sige, now Wolsey,\r\nWulf-noth, now the imitative Wallnutt, and Beorht-wulf, later Bardolph\r\nand Bardell.  The famous name Havelock was borne by the hero of a\r\nmedieval epic, \"Havelock the Dane,\" but Dunstan is usually for the\r\nlocal Dunston.  On the other hand, Winston is a personal name,\r\nWine-stan, whence Winstanley.\r\n\r\nThese examples show that the pre-Norman names are by no means\r\nunrepresented in the twentieth century, but, in this matter, one must\r\nproceed with caution.  To take as examples the two names that head\r\nthis chapter, there is no doubt that Goderic and Godiva are now\r\nrepresented by Goodrich and Goodeve, but these may also belong to the\r\nsmall group mentioned in Chapter VI, and stand for good Richard and\r\ngood Eve.  Also Goodrich comes in some cases from Goodrich, formerly\r\nGotheridge, in Hereford, which has also given Gutteridge.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it must not be forgotten that our medieval nomenclature is\r\npreponderantly French, as the early rolls show beyond dispute, so\r\nthat, even where a modern name appears susceptible of an Anglo-Saxon\r\nexplanation, it is often safer to refer it to the Old French cognate;\r\nfor the Germanic names introduced into France by the Frankish\r\nconquerors, and the Scandinavian names which passed into Normandy,\r\ncontained very much the same elements as our own native names, but\r\nunderwent a different phonetic development.  Thus I would rather\r\nexplain Bawden, Bowden, Boulders, Boden, and the dims.  Body and\r\nBodkin, as Old French variants from the Old Ger. Baldawin than as\r\ncoming directly from Anglo-Saxon.  Boyden undoubtedly goes back to Old\r\nFr. Baudouin.\r\n\r\nPractically all the names given in Gower's lines (Chapter V), and many\r\nothers to which I have ascribed a continental origin, are found\r\noccasionally in England before the Conquest, but the weight of\r\nevidence shows that they were either adopted in England as French\r\nnames or were corrupted in form by the Norman scribes and officials.\r\nTo take other examples, our Tibbald, Tibbles, Tibbs suggest the Fr.\r\nThibaut rather than the natural development of Anglo-Sax. Thiudbeald,\r\ni.e. Theobald; and Ralph, Relf, Roff, etc., show the regular Old\r\nFrench development of Raedwulf, Radolf.  Tibaut Wauter, i.e. Theobald\r\nWalter, who lived in Lancashire in 1242, had both his names in an old\r\nFrench form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON NICKNAMES\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the various ways of forming nicknames or\r\ndescriptive names, are all used in the pre-Conquest personal names.\r\nWe find Orme, i.e. serpent or dragon (cf. Great Orme's Head), Wulf,\r\ni.e. Wolf, Hwita, i.e. White, and its derivative Hwiting, now Whiting,\r\nSaemann, i.e. Seaman, Bonda, i.e. Bond, Leofcild, dear child, now Leif\r\nchild, etc.  But, except the case of Orme, so common as the first\r\nelement of place-names, I doubt the survival of these as purely\r\npersonal names into the surname period and regard White, Seaman, Bond,\r\nLeif child rather as new epithets of Mid. English formation.  Whiting\r\nis of course Anglo-Saxon, -ing being the regular patronymic suffix.\r\nCf. Browning, Benning, Dering, Dunning, Gunning, Hemming, Kipping,\r\nManning, and many others which occur in place-names.  But not all\r\nnames in -ing are Anglo-Saxon, e.g. Baring is German; cf. Behring, of\r\nthe Straits; and Jobling is Fr. Jobelin, a double dim. of Job.\r\n\r\nI will now give a few examples of undoubted survival of these\r\nAnglo-Saxon compounds, showing how the suffixes have been corrupted\r\nand simplified.  Among the commonest of these suffixes are -beald,\r\n-beorht, -cytel (Chapter VII.), -god, -heard, -here, -man, -mund,\r\n-raed, -ric, -weald, -weard, -wine, [Footnote: Bold, bright, kettle,\r\ngod, strong, army, man, protection, counsel, powerful, ruling, guard,\r\nfriend.] which survive in Rumball and Rumbold (Rumbeald), Allbright\r\n[Footnote: AIbert is of modern German introduction.] and Allbutt\r\n(Ealdbeorht, i.e. Albert), Arkle (Earncytel), Allgood and Elgood\r\n(AElfgod), Everett (Eoforheard, i.e. Everard), Gunter (Gundhere),\r\nHarman (Hereman), Redmond (Raedmund), [Footnote: Pure Anglo-Saxon,\r\nlike the names of so many opponents of English tyranny.  Parnell is of\r\ncourse not Irish (Chapter X).] Aldred, Eldred (AEthelraed or\r\nEaldraed), Aldridge, Alderick, Eldridge (AEthelric or Ealdric),\r\nThorold (Thurweald), and, through Fr. Turold, Turrell, Terrell, and\r\nTyrrell, Harward and Harvard (Hereweard), Lewin (Leofwine).\r\n\r\nIn popular use some of these endings got confused, e.g. Rumbold\r\nprobably sometimes represents Rumweald, while Kennard no doubt stands\r\nfor Coenweard as well as for Coenheard.  Man and round were often\r\ninterchanged (Chapter VI), so that from Eastmund come both Esmond and\r\nEastman.  Gorman represents Gormund, and Almond (Chapter XI) is so\r\ncommon in the Middle Ages that it must sometimes be from AEthelmund.\r\n\r\nSometimes the modern forms are imitative.  Thus Allchin is for\r\nEalhwine (Alcuin), and Goodyear, Goodier and Goodair may represent\r\nGodhere.  [Footnote: This may, however, be taken literally.  There is\r\na German name Gutjahr and a Norfolk name Feaveryear.] Good-beer,\r\nGodbehere, Gotobed are classed by Bardsley under Godbeorht, whence\r\nGodber.  But in these three names the face value of the words may well\r\nbe accepted (pp.  156, 203, 206).  Wisgar or Wisgeard has given the\r\nimitative Whisker and Vizard, and, through French, the Scottish\r\nWishart, which is thus the same as the famous Norman Guiscard.\r\nGarment and Rayment are for Garmund and Regenmund, i.e. Raymond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON SURVIVALS\r\n\r\nOther names which can be traced directly to the group of Anglo-Saxon\r\nnames dealt with above are Elphick (AElfheah), which in Norman French\r\ngave Alphege, Elmer (AElfmaer), Allnutt (AElfnoth), Alwin, Elwin,\r\nElvin (AElfwine), Aylmer (AEthelmaer), Aylward (AEthelweard), Kenrick\r\n(Coenric), Collard (Ceolheard), Colvin (Ceolwine), Darwin (Deorwine),\r\nEdridge (Eadric), Aldwin, Auden (Ealdwine), Baldry (Bealdred or\r\nBealdric), Falstaff (Fastwulf), Filmer (Filumaer), Frewin eowine),\r\nGarrard, Garrett, Jarrold (Gaerheard, Gaerweald), but probably these\r\nare through French, Garbett (Garbeald, with which cf. the Italian\r\nGaribaldi), Gatliffe (Geatleof), Goddard (Godheard), Goodliffe\r\n(Godleof), Gunnell (Gunhild), Gunner (Gunhere), [Footnote: It is\r\nunlikely that this name is connected with gun, a word of too late\r\nappearance.  It may be seen over a shop in Brentford, perhaps kept by\r\na descendant of the thane of the adjacent Gunnersbury.] Haines\r\n(Hagene), Haldane (Haelfdene), Hastings (Haesten, the Danish chief who\r\ngave his name to Hastings, formerly Haestinga-ceaster), Herbert\r\n(Herebeorht), Herrick Hereric), Hildyard (Hildegeard), Hubert,\r\nHubbard, Hobart, Hibbert (Hygebeorht), Ingram (Ingelram), Lambert\r\n(Landbeorht), Livesey (Leofsige), Lemon (Leofman), Leveridge\r\n(Leofric), Loveridge (Luferic), Maynard (Maegenheard), Manfrey\r\n(Maegenfrith),  Rayner (Regenhere), Raymond (Regenmund), Reynolds\r\n(Regenweald), Seabright (Sigebeorht or Saebeorht), Sayers (Saegaer),\r\n[Footnote: The simple Sayer is also for \"assayer,\" either of metals or\r\nof meat and drink--\"essayeur, an essayer; one that tasts, or takes an\r\nessay; and particularly, an officer in the mint, who touches every\r\nkind of new Coyne before it be delivered out\" (Cotgrave).  Robert le\r\nsayer, goldsmith, was a London citizen c. 1300.]  Sewell (Saeweald or\r\nSigeweald), Seward (Sigeweard), Turbot (Thurbeorht), Thoroughgood\r\n(Thurgod), Walthew (Waltheof), Warman (Waermund), Wyberd (Wigbeorht),\r\nWyman (Wigmund), Willard (Wilheard), Winfrey (Winefrith), Ulyett and\r\nWoollett (Wulfgeat), Wolmer (Wulfmaer), Woodridge (Wulfric).\r\n\r\nIn several of these, e.g. Fulcher, Hibbert, Lambert, Reynolds, the\r\nprobability is that the name came through French.  Where an\r\nalternative explanation is possible, the direct Anglo-Saxon origin is\r\ngenerally the less probable.  Thus, although Coning occurs as an\r\nAnglo-Saxon name, Collings is generally a variant of Collins (cf.\r\nJennings for Jennins), and though Hammond is etymologically Haganmund,\r\nit is better to connect it with the very popular French name Hamon.\r\nSimmonds might come from Sigemund, but is more likely from Simon with\r\nexcrescent -d (Epithesis, Chapter III).\r\n\r\nIn many cases the Anglo-Saxon name was a simplex instead of a\r\ncompound.  The simple Cytel survives as Chettle, Kettle.  [Footnote:\r\nConnected with the kettle or cauldron of Norse mythology.  The\r\nrenowned Captain Kettle, described by his creator as a Welshman, must\r\nhave descended from some hardy Norse pirate.  Many names in this\r\nchapter are Scandinavian.]  Beorn is one of the origins of Barnes.\r\nBrand also appears as Braund, Grim is common in place-names, and from\r\nGrima we have Grimes.  Cola gives Cole, the name of a monarch of\r\nancient legend, but this name is more usually from Nicolas (Chapter\r\nVI).  Gonna is now Gunn, Serl has given the very common Searle, and\r\nWicga is Wigg.  From Hacun we have Hack and the dim. Hackett.\r\n\r\nTo these might be added many examples of pure adjectives, such as\r\nFreo, Free, Froda, (prudent), Froude, Gods, Good, Leof (dear), Leif,\r\nLeaf, Read (red), Read, Reid, Reed, Rica, Rich, Rudda (ruddy), Rudd\r\nand Rodd, Snel (swift, valiant), Snell, Swet, Sweet, etc., or epithets\r\nsuch as Boda (messenger), Bode, Cempa (warrior), Kemp, Cyta, Kite,\r\nDreng (warrior), Dring, Eorl, Earl, Godcild, Goodchild, Nunna, Nunn,\r\nOter, Otter, Puttoc (kite), Puttock, Saemann, Seaman, Spearhafoc,\r\nSparhawk, Spark (Chapter I), Tryggr (true), Triggs, Unwine (unfriend),\r\nUnwin, etc.  But many of these had died out as personal names and, in\r\nmedieval use, were nicknames pure and simple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOSYLLABIC NAMES\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a very large group of Anglo-Saxon dissyllabic names,\r\nusually ending in -a, which appear to be pet forms of the longer\r\nnames, though it is not always possible to establish the connection.\r\nMany of them have double forms with a long and short vowel\r\nrespectively.  It is to this class that we must refer the large number\r\nof our monosyllabic surnames, which would otherwise defy\r\ninterpretation.  Anglo-Sax. Dodds gave Dodd, while Dodson's partner\r\nFogg had an ancestor Focga.  Other examples are Bacga, Bagg, Benna,\r\nBenn, Bota, Boot and dim. Booty, Botts, Bolt, whence Bolting, Bubba,\r\nBubb, Budda, Budd, Bynna, Binns, Cada, Cade, Cobbs, Cobb, Coda, Coad,\r\nCodda, Codd, Cuffs, Cuff, Deda, Deedes, Duda, Dowd, Duna, Down, Donna,\r\nDunn, Dutta, Dull, Eada, Eade, Edes, etc., Ebba, Ebbs; Eppa, Epps,\r\nHudda, Hud, whence Hudson, Inga, Inge, Sibba, Sibbs, Sicga, Siggs,\r\nTata, Tate and Tait, Tidda, Tidd, Tigga, Tigg, Toca, Tooke, Tucca,\r\nTuck, Wada, Wade, Wadda, Waddy, etc.  Similarly French took from\r\nGerman a number of surnames formed from shortened names in -o, with an\r\naccusative in -on, e.g. Old Ger. Bodo has given Fr. Bout and Bouton,\r\nwhence perhaps our Butt and Button.\r\n\r\nBut the names exemplified above are very thinly represented in early\r\nrecords, and, though their existence in surnames derived from\r\nplace-names (Dodsley, Bagshaw, Bensted, Bedworth, Cobham, Ebbsworth,\r\netc.) would vouch for them even if they were not recorded, their\r\ncomparative insignificance is attested by the fact that they form very\r\nfew derivatives.\r\n\r\nCompare, for instance, the multitudinous surnames which go back to\r\nmonosyllables of the later type of name, such as John and Hugh, with\r\nthe complete sterility of the names above.  Therefore, when an\r\nalternative derivation for a surname is possible, it is usually ten to\r\none that this alternative is right.  Dodson is a simplified Dodgson,\r\nfrom Roger (Chapter VI); Benson belongs to Benedict, sometimes to\r\nBenjamin; Cobbett is a disguised Cuthbert or Cobbold (cf. Garrett,\r\nChapter II); Down is usually local, at the down or dune; Dunn is\r\nmedieval le dun, a colour nickname; names in Ead-, Ed-, are usually\r\nfrom the medieval female name Eda (Chapter VI); Sibbs generally\r\nbelongs to Sibilla or Sebastian; Tait must sometimes be for Fr. Tête,\r\nwith which cf. Eng. Head; Tidd is an old pet form of Theodore; and\r\nWade is more frequently atte wade, i.e. ford.  Even Ebbs and Epps are\r\nmore likely to be shortened forms of Isabella, usually reduced to Ib,\r\nor Ibbot (Chapter X), or of the once popular Euphemia.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we may say that the Anglo-Saxon element in our surnames is\r\nmuch larger than one would imagine from Bardsley's Dictionary, and\r\nthat it accounts, not only for names which have a distinctly\r\nAnglo-Saxon suffix or a disguised form of one, but also for a very\r\nlarge number of monosyllabic names which survive in isolation and\r\nwithout kindred.  In this chapter I have only given sets of\r\ncharacteristic examples, to which many more might be added.  It would\r\nbe comparatively easy, with some imagination and a conscientious\r\nneglect of evidence, to connect the greater number of our surnames\r\nwith the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\nThus Honeyball might very well represent the Anglo-Sax. Hunbeald, but,\r\nin the absence of links, it is better to regard it as a popular\r\nperversion of Hannibal (Chapter VIII).  In dealing with this subject,\r\nthe via media is the safe one, and one cannot pass in one stride from\r\nHengist and Horsa to the Reformation period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HIDEOUS NAMES\"\r\n\r\nMatthew Arnold, in his essay on the Function of Criticism at the\r\nPresent Time, is moved by the case of Poor Wragg, who was \"in\r\ncustody,\" to the following wail--\r\n\r\n\"What a touch of grossness in our race, what an original shortcoming\r\nin the more delicate spiritual perceptions, is shown by the natural\r\ngrowth amongst us of such hideous names-Higginbottom, Stiggins, Bugg!\"\r\n\r\nBut this is the poet's point of view.  Though there may have been \"no\r\nWragg by the Ilissus,\" it is not a bad name, for, in its original form\r\nRagg, it is the first element of the heroic Ragnar, and probably\r\nunrelated to Raggett, which is the medieval le ragged.  Bugg, which\r\none family exchanged for Norfolk Howard, is the Anglo-Saxon Bucgo, a\r\nname no doubt borne by many a valiant warrior.  Stiggins, as we have\r\nseen (Chapter XIII), goes back to a name great in history, and\r\nHigginbottom (Chapter XII) is purely geographical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. PALADINS AND HEROES\r\n\r\n\"Morz est Rollanz, Deus en ad l'anme es ciels.\r\n Li Emperere en Rencesvals parvient...\r\n Carles escriet: 'U estes vus, bels niés?\r\n U l'Arcevesques e li quens Oliviers?\r\n U est Gerins e sis cumpainz Geriers?\r\n Otes u est e Ii quens Berengiers?\r\n Ives e Ivories que j'aveie tant chiers?\r\n Qu'est devenuz li Guascuinz Engeliers,\r\n Sansun li dux e Anseïs li fiers?\r\n U est Gerarz de Russillun li vielz,\r\n Li duze per que j'aveie laissiet?'\"\r\n\r\n(Chanson de Roland, 1.  2397.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote: \"Dead is Roland, God has his soul in heaven.  The Emperor\r\narrives at Roncevaux... Charles cries: 'Where are you, fair nephew?\r\nWhere the archbishop (Turpin) and Count Oliver?  Where is Gerin and\r\nhis comrade Gerier?  Where is Odo and count Berenger?  Ivo and Ivory\r\nwhom I held so dear?  What has become of the Gascon Engelier?  Samson\r\nthe duke and Anseis the proud?  Where is Gerard of Roussillon the old,\r\nthe twelve peers whom I had left?' \"]\r\n\r\nIt is natural that many favourite names should be taken from those of\r\nheroes of romance whose exploits were sung all over Europe by\r\nwandering minstrels.  Such names, including those taken from the Round\r\nTable legends, usually came to us through French, though a few names\r\nof the British heroes are Welsh, e.g. Cradock from Caradoc\r\n(Caractacus) and Maddox from Madoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROUND TABLE\r\n\r\nBut the Round Table stories were versified much later than the true\r\nOld French Chansons de Geste, which had a basis in the national\r\nhistory, and not many of Arthur's knights are immortalized as\r\nsurnames.  We have Tristram, Lancelot, whence Lance, Percival, Gawain\r\nin Gavin, and Kay.  But the last named is, like Key, more usually from\r\nthe word we now spell \"quay,\" though Key and Keys can also be\r\nshop-signs, as of course Crosskeys is.  Linnell is sometimes for\r\nLionel, as Neil, [Footnote: But the Scottish Neil is a Gaelic name\r\noften exchanged for the unrelated Nigel.]  Neal for Nigel.  The ladies\r\nhave fared better.  Vivian, which is sometimes from the masculine\r\nVivien, is found in Dorset as Vye, and Isolt and Guinevere, which long\r\nsurvived as font-names in Cornwall, have given several names.  From\r\nIsolt come Isard, Isitt, Izzard, Izod, and many other forms, while\r\nGuinever appears as Genever, Jennifer, Gaynor, Gilliver, Gulliver,\r\n[Footnote: There is also an Old Fr. Gulafre which will account for\r\nsome of the Gullivers.]  and perhaps also as Juniper.  It is probably\r\nalso the source of Genn and Ginn, though these may come also from\r\nEugenia or from Jane.  The later prose versions of the Arthurian\r\nstories, such as those of Malory, are full of musical and picturesque\r\nnames like those used by Mr. Maurice Hewlett, but this artificial\r\nnomenclature has left no traces in our surnames.\r\n\r\nOf the paladins the most popular was Roland or Rowland, who survives\r\nas Rowe, Rowlinson, Rolls, Rollit, etc., sometimes coalescing with the\r\nderivations of Raoul, another epic hero.  Gerin or Geri gave Jeary,\r\nand Oates is the nominative (Chapter VIII) of Odo, an important Norman\r\nname.  Berenger appears as Barringer and Bellinger (Chapter III).  The\r\nsimple Oliver is fairly common, but it also became the Cornish Olver.\r\nBut perhaps the largest surname family connected with the paladins is\r\nderived from the Breton Ives or Ivon [Footnote: A number of Old French\r\nnames had an accusative in -on or -ain.  Thus we find Otes, Oton,\r\nIves, Ivain, and feminines such as Ide, Idain, all of which survive as\r\nEnglish surnames.] whose name appears in that of two English towns.\r\nIt is the same as Welsh Evan, and the Yvain of the Arthurian legends,\r\nand has given us Ives, Ivison, Ivatts, etc.  The modern surname Ivory\r\nis usually an imitative form of Every or Avery (p, 82).  Gerard has a\r\nvariety of forms in Ger- and Gar-, Jerand Jar- (see p.32).  The others\r\ndo not seem to have survived, except the redoubtable Archbishop\r\nTurpin, whose fame is probably less than that of his namesake Dick.\r\n\r\nBesides the paladins, there are many heroes of Old French epic whose\r\nnames were popular during the two centuries that followed the\r\nConquest.  Ogier le Danois, who also fought at Roncevaux, has given us\r\nOdgers; Fierabras occasionally crops up as Fairbrass, Firebrace;\r\nAimeri de Narbonne, from Almaric, [Footnote: A metathesis of Amalric,\r\nwhich is found in Anglo-Saxon.]  whence Ital. Amerigo, is in English\r\nAmery, Emery, Imray, etc.; Renaud de Montauban is represented by\r\nReynolds (Chapter VII) and Reynell.\r\n\r\nThe famous Doon de Mayence may have been an ancestor of Lorna, and the\r\nequally famous Garin, or Warin, de Monglane has given us Gearing,\r\nGearing, Waring, sometimes Warren, and the diminutives Garnett and\r\nWarnett.  Milo, of Greek origin, became Miles, with dim. Millett, but\r\nthe chief origin of the surname Miles is a contracted form of the\r\ncommon font-name Michael.  Amis and Amiles were the David and Jonathan\r\nof Old French epic and the former survives as Ames, Amies, and Amos,\r\nthe last an imitative form.\r\n\r\nWe have also Berner from Bernier, Bartram from Bertran, Farrant from\r\nFernand, Terry and Terriss from Thierry, the French form of Ger.\r\nDietrich (Theodoric), which, through Dutch, has given also Derrick.\r\nGarner, from Ger. Werner, is our Garner and Warner, though these have\r\nother origins (pp.  154, 185).  Dru, from Drogo, has given Drew, with\r\ndim. Druitt (Chapter V), and Druce, though the latter may also come\r\nfrom the town of Dreux.  Walrond and Waldron are for Waleran, usually\r\nGaleran, and King Pippin had a retainer named Morant.  Saint Leger, or\r\nLeodigarius, appears as Ledger, Ledgard, etc., and sometimes in the\r\nshortened Legg.  Among the heroines we have Orbell from Orable, while\r\nBlancheflour may have suggested Lillywhite; but the part played by\r\nwomen in the Chansons de Geste was insignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANSONS DE GESTE\r\n\r\nAs this element in our nomenclature has hitherto received no\r\nattention, it may be well to add a few more examples of names which\r\noccur very frequently in the Chansons de Geste and which have\r\nundoubted representatives in modern English.  Allard was one of the\r\nFour Sons of Aymon.  The name is etymologically identical with Aylward\r\n(Chapter VII), but in the above form has reached us through French.\r\nAcard or Achard is represented by Haggard, Haggett, and Hatchard,\r\nHatchett, though Haggard probably has another origin (Chapter XXIII).\r\nHarness is imitative for Harnais, Herneis.  Clarabutt is for\r\nClarembaut; cf. Archbutt for Archembaut, the Old French form of\r\nArchibald, Archbold.  Durrant is Durand, still a very common French\r\nsurname.  Ely is Old Fr. Élie, i.e. Elias (Chapter IX), which had the\r\ndim. Elyot.  [Footnote: For other names belonging to this group see\r\nChapter IX.]  We also find Old Fr. Helye, whence our Healey.\r\nEnguerrand is telescoped to Ingram, though this may also come from the\r\nEnglish form Ingelram.  Fawkes is the Old Fr. Fauques, nominative\r\n(Chapter VIII) of Faucon, i.e. falcon.  Galpin is contracted from\r\nGalopin, a famous epic thief, but it may also come from the common\r\nnoun galopin--\r\n\r\n\"Galloppins, under cookes, or scullions in monasteries.\"\r\n\r\n(Cotgrave.)\r\n\r\nIn either case it means a \"runner.\" Henfrey is from Heinfrei or\r\nHainfroi, identical with Anglo-Sax. Haganfrith, and Manser from\r\nManesier.  Neame (Chapter XXI) may sometimes represent Naime, the\r\nNestor of Old French epic and the sage counsellor of Charlemagne.\r\nRicher, from Old Fr. Richier, has generally been absorbed by the\r\ncognate Richard.  Aubrey and Avery are from Alberic, cognate with\r\nAnglo-Sax. AElfric.  An unheroic name like Siggins may be connected\r\nwith several heroes called Seguin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUE NAMES\r\n\r\nNor are the heroes of antiquity altogether absent.  Along with Old\r\nFrench national and Arthurian epics there were a number of romances\r\nbased on the legends of Alexander, Caesar, and the tale of Troy.\r\nAlexander, or Saunder, was the favourite among this class of names,\r\nespecially in Scotland.  Cayzer was generally a nickname (Chapter\r\nXIII), its later form Cesar being due to Italian influence, [Footnote:\r\nJulius Cesar, physician to Queen Elizabeth, was a Venetian\r\n(Bardsley).] and the same applies to Hannibal, [Footnote: But the\r\nfrequent occurrence of this name and its corruptions in Cornwall\r\nsuggests that it may really have been introduced by Carthaginian\r\nsailors.] when it is not an imitative form of the female name Annabel,\r\nalso corrupted into Honeyball.  Both Dionisius and Dionisia were once\r\ncommon, and have survived as Dennis, Dennett, Denny, and from the\r\nshortened Dye we get Dyson.  But this Dionisius was the patron saint\r\nof France.  Apparent names of heathen gods and goddesses are almost\r\nalways due to folk-etymology, e.g. Bacchus is for back-house or\r\nbake-house, and the ancestors of Mr. Wegg's friend Venus came from\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE BIBLE AND THE CALENDAR\r\n\r\n\" 'O Now you see, brother Toby,' he would say, looking up, 'that\r\nChristian names are not such indifferent things;--had Luther here been\r\ncalled by any other name but Martin, he would have been damn'd to all\r\neternity' \"\r\n\r\n (Tristram Shandy, ch. xxxv).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD TESTAMENT NAMES\r\n\r\nThe use of biblical names as font-names does not date from the\r\nPuritans, nor are surnames derived from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\r\nnecessarily Jewish.  The Old Testament names which were most popular\r\namong the medieval peasants from whom we nearly all spring were\r\nnaturally those connected with the most picturesque episodes of sacred\r\nhistory.  Taking as an example the father of all men, we find derived\r\nfrom the name Adam the following: Adams, Adamson, Adcock, Addis,\r\nAddison, Adds, Addy, Ade, Ades, Adey, Adis, Ady, Addey, Aday, Adee,\r\nAddyman, Adkin, Adkins, Adkinson, Adnett, [Footnote: Adenet (little\r\nAdam) le Roi was an Old French epic hero.] Adnitt, Adnet, Adnot,\r\nAtkin, Atkins, Atkinson, and the northern Aitken, etc.  This list,\r\ncompiled from Bardsley's Dictionary of Surnames, is certainly not\r\nexhaustive.  Probably Taddy is rimed on Addy as Taggy is on Aggy\r\n(Agnes).  To put together all the derivatives of John or Thomas would\r\nbe a task almost beyond the wit of man.  Names in Abb-, App-, may come\r\nfrom either Abraham or Abel, and from Abbs we also have Nabbs.  Cain\r\nwas of course unpopular.  Cain, Cane, Kain, when not Manx, is from the\r\ntown of Caen or from Norman quêne, an oak.\r\n\r\nMoses appears in the French form Moyes (Moïse) as early as 1273, and\r\nstill earlier as Moss.  Of the patriarchs the favourites were perhaps\r\nJacob and Joseph, the name Jessop from the latter having been\r\ninfluenced by Ital. Giuseppe.  Benjamin has sometimes given Benson and\r\nBennett, but these are generally for Benedict (Chapter IV).  The\r\nJudges are poorly represented, except Samson, a name which has\r\nobviously coalesced with the derivatives of Samuel.  David had, of\r\ncourse, an immense vogue, especially in Wales (for some of its\r\nderivatives see Chapter VI), and Solomon was also popular, the modern\r\nSalmon not always being a Jewish name.\r\n\r\nBut almost the favourite Old Testament name was Elijah, Elias, which,\r\nusually through its Old French form Élie, whence Ely, is the parent of\r\nEllis, Elliot, and many other names in El-, some of which, however,\r\nhave to be shared with Ellen and Alice (Chapter X).  Job was also\r\npopular, and is easily recognized in Jobson, Jobling, etc., but less\r\neasily in Chubb (Chapter III) and Jupp.  The intermediate form was the\r\nobsolete Joppe.  Among the prophetic writers Daniel was an easy\r\nwinner, Dann, Dance (Chapter I), Dannatt, Dancock, etc.  Balaam is an\r\nimitative spelling of the local Baylham.\r\n\r\nIn considering these Old Testament names it must be remembered that\r\nthe people did not possess the Bible in the vernacular.  The teaching\r\nof the parish priests made them familiar with selected episodes, from\r\nwhich they naturally took the names which appeared to contain the\r\ngreatest element of holiness or of warlike renown.  It is probable\r\nthat the mystery plays were not without influence; for the personal\r\nname was not always a fixed quantity, and many of the names mentioned\r\nin the preceding paragraph may have been acquired rather on the\r\nmedieval stage than at the font.\r\n\r\nThis would apply with still more force to names taken from the legends\r\nof saints and martyrs on which the miracle plays were based.  We even\r\nfind the names Saint, Martyr and Postill, the regular aphetic form of\r\napostle (Chapter III), just as we find King and Pope.  Camden,\r\nspeaking of the freedom with which English names are formed, quotes a\r\nDutchman, who--\r\n\r\n\"When he heard of English men called God and Devil, said, that the\r\nEnglish borrowed names from all things whatsoever, good or bad.\"\r\n\r\nThe medieval name Godde may of course be for Good, Anglo-Sax. Goda,\r\nbut Ledieu is common enough in France.  The name seems to be obsolete,\r\nunless it is disguised as Goad.  The occurrence in medieval rolls of\r\nDiabolus and le Diable shows that Deville need not always be for de\r\nEyville.  There was probably much competition for this important part,\r\nand the name would not be always felt as uncomplimentary.  Among\r\nGerman surnames we find not only Teufel, but also the compounds\r\nManteufel and Teufelskind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW TESTAMENT NAMES\r\n\r\nComing to the New Testament, we find the four Evangelists strongly\r\nrepresented, especially the first and last.  Matthew appears not only\r\nin an easily recognizable form, e.g. in Matheson, but also as Mayhew\r\nand Mayo, Old Fr. Mahieu.  From the latter form we have the shortened\r\nMay and Mee, whence Mayes, Makins, Meakin, Meeson, [Footnote: One\r\nfamily of Meeson claims descent from Malvoisin.]  and sometimes Mason.\r\nMark is one of the sources of March (p, 90), as Luke is of Luck,\r\nwhence Lucock, Luckett, etc, though we more often find the learned\r\nform Lucas.\r\n\r\nOf John there is no need to speak.  Of the apostles the great\r\nfavourites, Simon, or Peter, John, and Bartholomew have already been\r\nmentioned.  Almost equally popular was Philip, whence Philp, Phipps,\r\nPhelps, and the dim. Philpot, whence the aphetic Pott, Potts.  Andrew\r\nflourished naturally in Scotland, its commonest derivative being\r\nAnderson, while Dendy is for the rimed form Dandy.  Paul has of course\r\nhad a great influence and is responsible for Pawson or Porson,\r\nPawling, Polson, Pollett, and most names in Pol-. [Footnote: This does\r\nnot of course apply to Cornish names in Pol- (Chapter VI)]  It is\r\nalso, in the form Powell, assimilated to the Welsh Ap Howel.  Paul is\r\nregularly spelt Poule by Chaucer, and St. Paul's Cathedral is often\r\ncalled Powles in Tudor documents.  Paul's companions are poorly\r\nrepresented, for Barnby is local, while names in Sil- and Sel- come\r\nfrom shortened form of Cecil, Cecilia, and Silvester.  Another great\r\nname from the Acts of the Apostles is that of the protomartyr Stephen,\r\namong the numerous derivatives of which we must include Stennett and\r\nStimpson.\r\n\r\nMany non-biblical saints whose names occur very frequently have\r\nalready been mentioned, e.g. Antony, Bernard, Gregory, Martin,\r\nLawrence, Nicholas, etc To these may be added Augustine, or Austin,\r\nChristopher, or Kit, with the dim. Christie and the patronymic Kitson,\r\nClement, whence a large family of names in Clem-, Gervase or Jarvis,\r\nJerome, sometimes represented by Jerram, and Theodore or Tidd (cf.\r\nTibb fron Theobald), who becomes in Welsh Tudor.  Vincent has  given\r\nVince, Vincey and Vincett, and Baseley, Blazey are from Basil and\r\nBlaine.  The Anglo-Saxon saints are poorly represented, though\r\nprobably most of them survive in a disguised form, e.g. Price is\r\nsometimes for Brice, Cuthbert has sometimes given Cubitt and Cobbett,\r\nand also Cutts.  Bottle sometimes represents Botolf, Neate may be for\r\nNeot, and Chad (Ceadda) survives as Chatt and in many local names.\r\nThe Cornish Tangye is from the Breton St. Tanneguy.  The Archangel\r\nMichael has given one of our commonest names, Mitchell (Chapter IV).\r\nThis is through French, but we have also the contracted Miall--\r\n\r\n\"At Michael's term had many a trial,\r\nWorse than the dragon and St. Michael.\"\r\n\r\n(Hudibras, III. ii. 51.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Cf. Vialls from Vitalis, also a saint's name.]\r\n\r\nThis name exists in several other forms, e.g. Mihell, Myhill, Mighill,\r\nand most frequently of all as Miles (Chapter VIII).  The reader will\r\nremember the famous salient of Saint-Mihiel, on the Meuse, held by the\r\nGermans for so long a period of the war.  From Gabriel we have Gabb,\r\nGabbett, etc.  The common rustic pronunciation Gable has given Cable\r\n(Chapter III).\r\n\r\nAmong female saints we find Agnes, pronounced Annis, the derivatives\r\nof which have become confused with those of Anne, or Nan, Catherine,\r\nwhence Call, Catlin, etc., Cecilia, Cicely, whence Sisley, and of\r\ncourse Mary and Margaret.  For these see Chapter X.  St. Bride, or\r\nBridget, survives in Kirkbride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEAST-DAYS\r\n\r\nA very interesting group of surnames are derived from font-names taken\r\nfrom the great feasts of the Church, date of birth or baptism, etc.\r\n[Footnote: Names of this class were no doubt also sometimes given to\r\nfoundlings.]  These are more often French or Greco-Latin than English,\r\na fact to be explained by priestly influence.  Thus Christmas is much\r\nless common than Noel or Nowell, but we also find Midwinter (Chapter\r\nII) and Yule.  Easter has a local origin (from a place in Essex) and\r\nalso represents Mid. Eng. estre, a word of very vague meaning for part\r\nof a building, originally the exterior, from Lat. extra.  It survives\r\nin Fr. les êtres d'une maison.  Hester, to which Bardsley gives the\r\nsame origin, I should rather connect with Old Fr. hestre (hêtre), a\r\nbeech.  However that may be, the Easter festival is represented in our\r\nsurnames by Pascall, Cornish Pascoe, and Pask, Pash, Pace, Pack.\r\n\r\nPatch, formerly a nickname for a jester (Chapter XX), from his motley\r\nclothes, is also sometimes a variant of Pash.  And the dim. Patchett\r\nhas become confused with Padgett, from Padge, a rimed form of Madge.\r\nPentecost is recorded as a personal name in Anglo-Saxon times.\r\nMichaelmas is now Middleman (Chapter III), and Tiffany is an old name\r\nfor Epiphany.  It comes from Greco-Latin theophania (while Epiphany\r\nrepresents epiphania), which gave the French female name Tiphaine,\r\nwhence our Tiffin.  Lammas (loaf mass) is also found as a personal\r\nname, but there is a place called Lammas in Norfolk.  We have\r\ncompounds of day in Halliday or Holiday, Hay-day, for high day,\r\nLoveday, a day appointed for reconciliations, and Hockaday, for a\r\nchild born during Hocktide, which begins on the 15th day after Easter.\r\nIt was also called Hobday, though it is hard to say why; hence the\r\nname Hobday, unless this is to be taken as the day, or servant\r\n(Chapter XIX), in the service of Hob; cf. Hobman.\r\n\r\nThe days of the week are puzzling, the only one at all common being\r\nMunday, though most of the others are found in earlier nomenclature.\r\nWe should rather expect special attention to be given to Sunday and\r\nFriday, and, in fact, Sonntag and Freytag are by far the most usual in\r\nGerman, while Dimanche and its perversions are common in France, and\r\nVendredi also occurs.  This makes me suspect some other origin,\r\nprobably local, for Munday, the more so as Fr. Dimanche, Demange,\r\netc., is often for the personal name Dominicus, the etymology\r\nremaining the same as that of the day-name, the Lord's day.  Parts of\r\nthe day seem to survive in Noon, Eve, and Morrow, but Noon is local,\r\nFr. Noyon (cf. Moon, earlier Mohun, from Moyon), Eve is the mother of\r\nmankind, and Morrow is for moor-wro, the second element being Mid.\r\nEng. wra, comer, whence Wray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTH NAMES\r\n\r\nWe find the same difficulty with the names of the months.  Several of\r\nthese are represented in French, but our March has four other origins,\r\nfrom March in Cambridgeshire, from march, a boundary, from marsh, or\r\nfrom Mark; while May means in Mid. English a maiden (Chapter XXI), and\r\nis also a dim. of Matthew (Chapter IX).  The names of the seasons also\r\npresent difficulty.  Spring usually corresponds to Fr. La Fontaine\r\n(Chapter II), but we find also Lent, the old name for the season, and\r\nFrench has Printemps. [Footnote: The cognate Ger. Lenz is fairly\r\ncommon, hence the frequency of Lent in America.]  Summer and Winter\r\n[Footnote: Winter was one of Hereward's most faithful comrades.]  are\r\nfound very early as nicknames, as are also Frost and Snow; but why\r\nalways Summers or Somers with s and Winter without? [Footnote: Two\r\nother common nicknames were Flint and Steel.]  The latter has no doubt\r\nin many cases absorbed Vinter, vintner (Chapter III) but this will not\r\naccount for the complete absence of genitive forms.  And what has\r\nbecome of the other season?  We should not expect to find the learned\r\nword \"autumn,\" but neither Fall nor Harvest, the true English\r\nequivalents, are at all common as surnames.\r\n\r\nI regard this group, viz. days, months, seasons, as one of the least\r\nclearly accounted for in our nomenclature, and cannot help thinking\r\nthat the more copious examples which we find in French and German are\r\nlargely distorted forms due to the imitative instinct, or are\r\nsusceptible of other explanations.  This is certainly true in some\r\ncases, e.g. Fr. Mars is the regular French development of Medardus, a\r\nsaint to whom a well-known Parisian church is dedicated; and the\r\nrelationship of Janvier to Janus may be via the Late Lat. januarius,\r\nfor janitor, a doorkeeper.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Medardus was the saint who, according to Ingoldsby, lived\r\nlargely on oysters obtained by the Red Sea shore.  At his church in\r\nParis were performed the 'miracles' of the Quietists in the\r\nseventeenth century.  When the scenes that took place became a\r\nscandal, the government intervened, with the result that a wag adorned\r\nthe church door with the following:\r\n\r\n\"De par le Roi, défense à Dieu\r\nDe faire miracle en ce lieu.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. METRONYMICS\r\n\r\n\"During the whole evening Mr. Jellyby sat in a corner with his head\r\nagainst the wall, as if he were subject to low spirits.\"\r\n\r\n(Bleak House, ch. iv.)\r\n\r\nBardsley first drew attention to the very large number of surnames\r\nderived from an ancestress.  His views have been subjected to much\r\nignorant criticism by writers who, taking upon themselves the task of\r\ndefending medieval virtue, have been unwilling to accept this terrible\r\npicture of the moral condition of England, etc.  This anxiety is\r\nmisplaced.  There are many reasons, besides illegitimacy, for the\r\nadoption of the mother's name.  In medieval times the children of a\r\nwidow, especially posthumous children, would often assume the mother's\r\nname.  Widdowson itself is sufficiently common.  In the case of second\r\nmarriages the two families might sometimes be distinguished by their\r\nmothers' names.  Orphans would be adopted by female relatives, and a\r\nmedieval Mrs.  Joe Gargery would probably have impressed her own name\r\nrather than that of her husband on a medieval Pip.  In a village which\r\ncounted two Johns or Williams, and few villages did not, the children\r\nof one might assume, or rather would be given by the public voice, the\r\nmother's name.  Finally, metronymics can be collected in hundreds by\r\nanyone who cares to work through a few early registers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEMALE FONT-NAMES\r\n\r\nThus, in the Lancashire Inquests 205-1307 occur plenty of people\r\ndescribed as the sons of Alice, Beatrice, Christiana, Eda, Eva,\r\nMariot, Matilda, Quenilda, [Footnote: An Anglo-Saxon name, Cynehild,\r\nwhence Quennell.]  Sibilla, Ysolt.  Even if illegitimacy were the only\r\nreason, that would not concern the philologist.\r\n\r\nFemale names undergo the same course of treatment as male names.  Mary\r\ngave the diminutives Marion and Mariot, whence Marriott.  It was\r\npopularly shortened into Mal (cf. Hal for Harry), which had the\r\ndiminutive Mally.  From these we have Mawson and Malleson, the former\r\nalso belonging to Maud.  Mal and Mally became Mol and Molly, hence\r\nMollison.  The rimed forms Pol, Polly are later, and names in\r\nPol- usually belong to Paul (Chapter IX).  The name Morris has three\r\nother origins (the font-name Maurice, the nickname Moorish, and the local\r\nmarsh), but both Morris and Morrison are sometimes to be referred to\r\nMary.  Similarly Margaret, popularly Mar-get, became Mag, Meg, Mog,\r\nwhence Meggitt, Moxon, etc.  The rarity of Maggot is easily\r\nunderstood, but Poll Maggot was one of Jack Sheppard's accomplices and\r\nShakespeare uses maggot-pie for magpie (Macbeth, iii, 4).  Meg was\r\nrimed into Peg, whence Peggs, Mog into Pog, whence Pogson, and Madge\r\ninto Padge, whence Padgett, when this is not for Patchett (Chapter\r\nIX), or for the Fr. Paget, usually explained as Smallpage.  The royal\r\nname Matilda appears in the contracted Maud, Mould, Moule, Mott,\r\nMahood (Old Fr. Maheut).  Its middle syllable Till gave Tilly, Tillson\r\nand the dim. Tillet, Tillot, whence Tillotson.  From Beatrice we have\r\nBee, Beaton and Betts, and the northern Beattie, which are not\r\nconnected with the great name Elizabeth.  This is in medieval rolls\r\nrepresented by its cognate Isabel, of which the shortened form was\r\nBell (Chapter I), or Ib, the latter giving Ibbot, Ibbotson, and the\r\nrimed forms Tib-, Nib-, Bib-, Lib-.  Here also belong Ebbs and Epps\r\nrather than to the Anglo-Sax. Ebba (Chapter VII).\r\n\r\nMany names which would now sound somewhat ambitious were common among\r\nthe medieval peasantry and are still found in the outlying parts of\r\nEngland, especially Devon and Cornwall.  Among the characters in Mr.\r\nEden Phillpotts's Widecombe Fair are two sisters named Sibley and\r\nPetronell.  From Sibilla, now Sibyl, come most names in Sib-, though\r\nthis was used also as a dim. of Sebastian (see also Chapter VII),\r\nwhile Petronilla, has given Parnell, Purnell.  As a female name it\r\nsuffered the eclipse to which certain names are accidentally subject,\r\nand became equivalent to wench.  References to a \"prattling Parnel\"\r\nare common in old writers, and the same fate overtook it in French--\r\n\r\n\"Taisez-vous, péronnelle\" (Tartufe, i.  1).\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the survival of Guinevere (Chapter\r\nVIII).  From Cassandra we have Cash, Cass, Case, and Casson, from\r\nIdonia, Ide, Iddins, Iddison; these were no doubt confused with the\r\nderivatives of Ida.  William filius Idae is in the Fine Rolls of\r\nJohn's reign, and John Idonyesone occurs there, temp. Edward I.  Pim,\r\nas a female font-name, may be from Euphemia, and Siddons appears to\r\nbelong to Sidonia, while the pretty name Avice appears as Avis and\r\nHaweis.  From Lettice, Lat. laetitia, joy, we have Letts, Lettson,\r\nwhile the corresponding Joyce, Lat. jocosa, merry, has become confused\r\nwith Fr. Josse (Chapter I).  Anstey, Antis, is from Anastasia,\r\nPrecious from Preciosa, and Royce from Rohesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBTFUL CASES\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to separate patronymics from metronymics.  We\r\nhave already seen (Chapter VI) that names in Ed- may be from Eda or\r\nfrom Edward, while names in Gil- must be shared between Julian,\r\nJuliana, Guillaume, Gilbert, and Giles.  There are many other cases\r\nlike Julian and Juliana, e.g. Custance is for Constance, but Cust may\r\nalso represent the masculine Constant, while among the derivatives of\r\nPhilip we must not forget the warlike Philippa.  Or, to take pairs\r\nwhich are unrelated, Kitson may be from Christopher or from Catherine,\r\nand Mattison from Matthew or from Martha, which became Matty and\r\nPatty, the derivatives of the latter coalescing with those of Patrick\r\n(Chapter VI).  It is obvious that the derivatives of Alice would be\r\nconfused with those of Allen, while names in El- may represent Elias\r\nor Eleanor.  Also names in Al- and El- are sometimes themselves\r\nconfused, e.g. the Anglo-Saxon AElfgod appears both as Allgood and\r\nElgood.  More Nelsons are derived from Neil, i.e. Nigel, than from\r\nNell, the rimed dim. of Ellen.  Emmett is a dim. of Emma, but Empson\r\nmay be a shortened Emerson from Emery (Chapter VIII).  The rather\r\ncommonplace Tibbles stands for both Theobald and Isabella, and the\r\nsame is true of all names in Tib- and some in Teb-.  Lastly, the\r\ncoalescence of John, the commonest English font-name, with Joan, the\r\nearlier form of Jane, was inevitable, while the French forms Jean and\r\nJeanne would be undistinguishable in their derivatives.  These names\r\nbetween them have given an immense number of surnames, the masculine\r\nor feminine interpretation of which must be left to the reader's\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. LOCAL SURNAMES\r\n\r\n\"Now as men have always first given names unto places, so hath it\r\nafterwards grown usuall that men have taken their names from places\"\r\n\r\n(VERSTEGAN, Restitution of Decayed Intelligence).\r\n\r\nThere is an idea cherished by some people that the possession of a\r\nsurname which is that of a village or other locality points to\r\nancestral ownership of that region.  This is a delusion.  In the case\r\nof quite small features of the landscape, e.g. Bridge, Hill, the name\r\nwas given from place of residence.  But in the case of counties, towns\r\nand villages, the name was usually acquired when the locality was\r\nleft.  Thus John Tiler leaving Acton, perhaps for Acton's good, would\r\nbe known in his new surroundings as John Acton.  A moment's reflection\r\nwill show that this must be so.  Scott is an English name, the\r\naristocratic Scotts beyond the border representing a Norman family\r\nEscot, originally of Scottish origin.  English, early spelt Inglis, is\r\na Scottish name.  The names Cornish and Cornwallis first became common\r\nin Devonshire, as Devenish did outside that county.  French and\r\nFrancis, Old Fr. le franceis, are English names, just as  Langlois\r\n(l'Anglais) is common in France.  For the same reason Cutler is a rare\r\nname in Sheffield, where all are cutlers.  By exception the name\r\nCurnow, which is Cornish for a Cornishman, is fairly common in its\r\nnative county, but it was perhaps applied especially to those\r\ninhabitants who could only speak the old Cornish language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSES OF LOCAL NAMES\r\n\r\nThe local name may range in origin from a country to a plant (France,\r\nDarbishire, Lankester, Ashby, Street, House, Pound, Plumptre, Daisy),\r\nand, mathematically stated, the size of the locality will vary in\r\ndirect proportion to the distance from which the immigrant has come.\r\nTerentius Afer was named from a continent.  I cannot find a parallel\r\nin England, but names such as the nouns France, Ireland, Pettingell\r\n(Portugal), or the adjectives Dench, Mid. Eng. dense, Danish, Norman,\r\nWelsh, (Walsh, Wallis, etc.), Allman (Allemand), often perverted to\r\nAlmond, were considered a sufficient mark of identification for men\r\nwho came from foreign parts.  But the untravelled inhabitant, if\r\ndistinguished by a local name, would often receive it from some very\r\nminute feature of the landscape, e.g. Solomon Daisy may have been\r\ndescended from a Robert Dayeseye, who lived in Hunts in 1273.  It is\r\nnot very easy to see how such very trifling surnames as this last came\r\ninto existence, but its exiguity is surpassed in the case of a\r\nprominent French airman who bears the appropriately buoyant name of\r\nBrindejonc, perhaps from some ancestor who habitually chewed a straw.\r\n\r\nAn immense number of our countrymen are simply named from the points\r\nof the compass, slightly disguised in Norris, Anglo-Fr. le noreis,\r\n[Footnote: The corresponding le surreis is now represented by\r\nSurridge.] Sotheran, the southron, and Sterling, for Easterling, a\r\nname given to the Hanse merchants.  Westray was formerly le westreis.\r\nA German was to our ancestors, as he still is to sailors, a Dutchman,\r\nwhence our name Douch, Ger. deutsch, Old High Ger. tiutisc, which,\r\nthrough Old French tieis, has given Tyas.  [Footnote: Tyars, or Tyers,\r\nwhich Bardsley puts with this, seems to be rather Fr. Thiers, Lat.\r\ntertius.]\r\n\r\nBut not every local name is to be taken at its face value.  Holland is\r\nusually from one of the Lancashire Hollands, and England may be for\r\nMid. Eng. ing-land, the land of Ing (cf. Ingulf, Ingold, etc.), a\r\npersonal name which is the first element in many place-names, or from\r\ning, a meadow by a stream.  Holyland is not Palestine, but the\r\nholly-land.  Hampshire is often for Hallamshire, a district in\r\nYorkshire.  Dane is a variant of Mid. Eng. dene, a valley, the\r\ninhabitant of Denmark having given us Dench (Chapter XI) and Dennis\r\n(le daneis).  Visitors to Margate will remember the valley called the\r\nDane, which stretches from the harbour to St. Peters.  Saxon is not\r\nracial, but a perversion of sexton (Chapter XVII).  Mr. Birdofredum\r\nSawin, commenting on the methods employed in carrying out the great\r\nmission of the Anglo-Saxon race, remarks that--\r\n\r\n\"Saxons would be handy\r\nTo du the buryin' down here upon the Rio Grandy\"\r\n\r\n(Lowell, Biglow Papers).\r\n\r\nThe name Cockayne was perhaps first given derisively to a sybarite--\r\n\r\n\"Paris est pour le riche un pays de Cocagne\" (Boileau),\r\n\r\nbut it may be an imitative form of Coken in Durham.\r\n\r\nNames such as Morris, i.e. Moorish, or Sarson, i.e. Saracen (but also\r\nfor Sara-son), are rather nicknames, due to complexion or to an\r\nancestor who was mine host of the Saracen's Head.  Moor is sometimes\r\nof similar origin.  Russ, like Rush, is one of the many forms of Fr.\r\nroux, red-complexioned (Chapter II).  Pole is for Pool, the native of\r\nPoland being called Polack--\r\n\r\n\"He smote the sledded Polack on the ice\" (Hamlet, I. i).\r\n\r\nBut the name Pollock is local (Renfrewshire).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTIES AND TOWNS\r\n\r\nAs a rule it will be found that, while most of our counties have given\r\nfamily names, sometimes corrupted, e.g. Lankshear, Willsher, Cant,\r\nChant, for Kent, with which we may compare Anguish for Angus, the\r\nlarger towns are rather poorly represented, the movement having always\r\nbeen from country to town, and the smaller spot serving for more exact\r\ndescription.  An exception is Bristow (Bristol), Mid. Eng. brig-stow,\r\nthe place on the bridge, the great commercial city of the west from\r\nwhich so many medieval seamen hailed; but the name is sometimes from\r\nBurstow (Surrey), and there were possibly smaller places called by so\r\nnatural a name, just as the name Bradford, i.e. broad ford, may come\r\nfrom a great many other places than the Yorkshire wool town.  Rossiter\r\nis generally for Rochester, but also for Wroxeter (Salop); Coggeshall\r\nis well disguised as Coxall, Barnstaple as Bastable, Maidstone as\r\nMayston, Stockport as Stopford.  On the other hand, there is not a\r\nvillage of any antiquity but has, or once had, a representative among\r\nsurnames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES PRECEDED BY DE\r\n\r\nThe provinces and towns of France and Flanders have given us many\r\ncommon surnames.  From names of provinces we have Burgoyne and Burgin,\r\nChampain and Champneys (Chapter II), Gascoyne and Gaskin, Mayne,\r\nMansell, Old Fr. Mancel (manceau), an inhabitant of Maine or of its\r\ncapital Le Mans, Brett and Britton, Fr. le Bret and le Breton,\r\nPickard, Power, sometimes from Old Fr. Pohier, a Picard, Peto,\r\nformerly Peitow, from Poitou, Poidevin and Puddifin, for\r\n\r\nPoitevin, Loring, Old Fr. le Lohereng, the man from Lorraine,\r\nassimilated to Fleming, Hammy, an old name for Hainault, Brabazon, le\r\nBrabançon, and Brebner, formerly le Brabaner, Angwin, for Angevin,\r\nFlinders, a perversion of Flanders, Barry, which is sometimes for\r\nBerri, and others which can be identified by everybody.\r\n\r\nAmong towns we have Allenson, Alençon, Amyas, Amiens, Ainger, Angers,\r\nAris, Arras, Bevis, Beauvais, Bullen, Boulogne, Bloss, Blois, Bursell,\r\nBrussels, Callis and Challis, Calais, Challen, from one of the French\r\ntowns called Chalon or Chalons, Chaworth, Cahors, Druce, Dreux, Gaunt,\r\nGand (Ghent), Luck, Luick (Liege), Loving, Louvain, Malins, Malines\r\n(Mechlin), Raynes, Rennes and Rheims, Roan, Rouen, Sessions, Soissons,\r\nStamp, Old Fr. Estampes (ttampes), Turney, Tournay, etc.  The name de\r\nVerdun is common enough in old records for us to connect with it both\r\nthe fascinating Dolly and the illustrious Harry. [Footnote added by\r\nscanner: Some modern readers might not realise that Weekley was\r\nreferring to Harry Vardon, a famous golfer of the late nineteenth and\r\nearly twentieth century.  Dolly Varden was a character in Dickens'\r\n\"Barnaby Rudge\", a pretty girl in flowered hats and skirts.  Her name\r\nwas borrowed for various clothing styles, breeds of flowers, shows,\r\ntheatres and even angling fishes among other things.  There seem to\r\nhave been several references to \"the fascinating Dolly Varden\", though\r\nthe expression does not occur in the book.]  To the above may be\r\nadded, among German towns, Cullen, Cologne, and Lubbock, Luebeck, and,\r\nfrom Italy, Janes, Gênes (Genoa), Janaway or Janways, i.e. Genoese,\r\nand Lombard or Lombard.  Familiar names of foreign towns were often\r\nanglicized.  Thus we find Hamburg called Hamborough, Bruges Bridges,\r\nand Tours Towers.\r\n\r\nTo the town of Angers we sometimes owe, besides Ainger, the forbidding\r\nnames Anger and Danger.  In many local names of foreign origin the\r\npreposition de has been incorporated, e.g. Dalmain, d'Allemagne,\r\nsometimes corrupted into Dallman and Dollman, though these are also\r\nfor Doleman, from the East Anglian dole, a boundary, Dallison, d'Alenç\r\non, Danvers, d'Anvers, Antwerp, Devereux, d'Évreux, Daubeney,  Dabney,\r\nd'Aubigny, Disney, d'Isigny, etc.  Doyle is a later form of Doyley, or\r\nDolley, for d'Ouilli, and Darcy and Durfey were once d'Arcy and\r\nd'Urfé.  Dew is sometimes for de Eu.  Sir John de Grey, justice of\r\nChester, had in 1246 two Alice in Wonderland clerks named Henry de Eu\r\nand William de Ho.  A familiar example, which has been much disputed,\r\nis the Cambridgeshire name Death, which some of its possessors prefer\r\nto write D'Aeth or De Ath.  Bardsley rejects this, without, I think,\r\nsufficient reason.  It is true that it occurs as de Dethe in the\r\nHundred Rolls, but this is not a serious argument, for we find also de\r\nDaubeney (Chapter XI), the original de having already been absorbed at\r\nthe time the Rolls were compiled.  This retention of the de is also\r\ncommon in names derived from spots which have not become recognized\r\nplace-names; see Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\nBut to derive a name of obviously native origin from a place in France\r\nis a snobbish, if harmless, delusion.  There are quite enough moor\r\nleys in England without explaining Morley by Morlaix.  To connect the\r\nMid. English nickname Longfellow with Longueville, or the patronymic\r\nHansom (Chapter III) with Anceaumville, betrays the same belief in\r\nphonetic epilepsy that inspires the derivation of Barber from the\r\nchapelry of Sainte-Barbe.  The fact that there are at least three\r\nplaces, in England called Carrington has not prevented one writer from\r\nseeking the origin of that name in the appropriate locality of\r\nCharenton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. SPOT NAMES\r\n\r\n\"In ford, in ham, in ley and tun\r\nThe most of English surnames run\"\r\n\r\n(VERSTEGAN).\r\n\r\nVerstegan's couplet, even if it be not strictly true, makes a very\r\ngood text for a discourse on our local names.  The ham, or home, and\r\nthe ton, or town, originally an enclosure (cf. Ger. Zaun, hedge),\r\nwere, at any rate in a great part of England, the regular nucleus of\r\nthe village, which in some cases has become the great town and in\r\nothers has decayed away and disappeared from the map.  In an age when\r\nwool was our great export, flock keeping was naturally a most\r\nimportant calling, and the ley, or meadow land, would be quickly taken\r\nup and associated with human activity.  When bridges were scarce,\r\nfords were important, and it is easy to see how the inn, the smithy,\r\nthe cartwright's booth, etc., would naturally plant themselves at such\r\na spot and form the commencement of a hamlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENTS OF PLACE-NAMES\r\n\r\nEach of these four words exists by itself as a specific place-name and\r\nalso as a surname.  In fact Lee and Ford are among our commonest local\r\nsurnames.  In the same way the local origin of such names as Clay and\r\nChalk may be specific as well as general.  But I do not propose to\r\ndeal here with the vast subject of our English village names, but only\r\nwith the essential elements of which they are composed, elements which\r\nwere often used for surnominal purposes long before the spot itself\r\nhad developed into a village.  [Footnote: A good general account of\r\nour village names will be found in the Appendix to Isaac Taylor's\r\nNames and their Histories.  It is reprinted as chapter xi of the same\r\nauthor's Words and Places (Everyman Library).  See also Johnston's\r\nPlace-names of England and Wales, a glossary of selected names with a\r\ncomprehensive introduction.  There are many modern books on the\r\nvillage names of various counties, e.g. Bedfordshire, Berkshire,\r\nCambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Suffolk (Skeat),\r\nOxfordshire (Alexander), Lancashire (Wyld and Hirst), West Riding of\r\nYorkshire (Moorman), Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire\r\n(Duignan), Nottinghamshire (Mutschmann), Gloucestershire (Baddeley),\r\nHerefordshire (Bannister), Wiltshire (Elsblom), S.W. Yorkshire\r\n(Goodall), Sussex (Roberts), Lancashire (Sephton), Derbyshire\r\n(Walker), Northumberland and Durham (Mawer).]  Thus the name Oakley\r\nmust generally have been borne by a man who lived on meadow land which\r\nwas surrounded or dotted with oak-trees.  But I should be shy of\r\nexplaining a given village called Oakley in the same way, because the\r\nstudent of place-names might be able to show from early records that\r\nthe place was originally an ey, or island, and that the first syllable\r\nis the disguised name of a medieval churl.  These four simple etymons\r\nthemselves may also become perverted.  Thus -ham is sometimes confused\r\nwith -holm (Chapter XII), -ley, as I have just suggested, may in some\r\ncases contain -ey, -ton occasionally interchanges with -don and\r\n-stone, and -lord with the French -fort (Chapter XIV).\r\n\r\nIn this chapter will be found a summary of the various words applied\r\nby our ancestors to the natural features of the land they lived on.\r\nTo avoid too lengthy a catalogue, I have classified them under the\r\nthree headings--\r\n\r\n(1) Hill and Dale,\r\n\r\n(2) Plain and Woodland,\r\n\r\n(3) Water and Waterside,\r\n\r\nreserving for the next chapter the names due to man's interference\r\nwith the scenery, e.g. roads, buildings, enclosures, etc.\r\n\r\nThey are mostly Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian, the Celtic name remaining\r\nas the appellation of the individual hill, stream, etc. (Helvellyn,\r\nAvon, etc.).  The simple word has in almost all cases given a fairly\r\ncommon surname, but compounds are of course numerous, the first\r\nelement being descriptive of the second, e.g. Bradley, broad lea,\r\nRadley and Ridley, red lea, Brockley, brook lea or badger lea (Chapter\r\nXXIII), Beverley, beaver lea, Cleverley, clover lea, Hawley, hedge\r\nlea, Rawnsley, raven's lea, and so ad infinitum.  In the oldest\r\nrecords spot names are generally preceded by the preposition at,\r\nwhence such names as Attewell, Atwood, but other prepositions occur,\r\nas in Bythesea, Underwood and the hybrid Suttees, on Tees.  Cf. such\r\nFrench names as Doutrepont, from beyond the bridge.\r\n\r\nOne curious phenomenon, of which I can offer no explanation, is that\r\nwhile many spot names occur indifferently with or without -s, e.g.\r\nBridge, Bridges; Brook, Brooks; Platt, Plaits, in others we find a\r\nregular preference either for the singular or plural form.  [Footnote:\r\nIn some cases no doubt a plural, in others a kind of genitive due to\r\nthe influence of personal names, such as Wills, Perkins, etc.]\r\nCompare the following couples:\r\n\r\nField    Meadows\r\n\r\nLake     Rivers\r\n\r\nPool     Mears (metes)\r\n\r\nSpying   Wells\r\n\r\nHouse    Coates (P, 133)\r\n\r\nMarsh    Myers   (mires)\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Myers is very often a Jewish name, from the very common\r\nGer. Meyer, for which see Chapter IV.]\r\n\r\nto which many more might be added.  So we find regularly Nokes but\r\nNash (Chapter III), Beech but Willows.  The general tendency is\r\ncertainly towards the -s forms in the case of monosyllables, e.g.\r\nBanks, Foulds, Hayes, Stubbs, Thwaites, etc., but we naturally find\r\nthe singular in compounds, e.g. Windebank (winding), Nettlefold,\r\nRoundhay, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is also a further problem offered by names in -er.  We know that\r\na Waller was a mason or wall-builder, but was a Bridger really a\r\nPontifex, [Footnote: An example of a Latinized name.  Cf. Sutor,\r\nFaber, and the barbarous Sartorius, for sartor, a tailor.  Pontifex\r\nmay also be the latinized form of Pope or Bishop.  It is not known why\r\nthis title, bridge-builder, was given to high-priests.]  did he merely\r\nlive near the bridge, or was he the same as a Bridgman, and what was\r\nthe latter?  Did Sam Weller's ancestor sink wells, possess a well, or\r\nlive near someone else's well?  Probably all explanations may be\r\ncorrect, for the suffix may have differed in meaning according to\r\nlocality, but I fancy that in most cases proximity alone is implied.\r\nThe same applies to many cases of names in -man, such as Hillman,\r\nDickman (dyke), Parkman.\r\n\r\nMany of the words in the following paragraphs are obsolete or survive\r\nonly in local usage.  Some of them also vary considerably in meaning,\r\naccording to the region in which they are found.  I have included many\r\nwhich, in their simple form, seem too obvious to need explanation,\r\nbecause the compounds are not always equally clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHILL AND DALE\r\n\r\nWe have a fair number of Celtic words connected with natural scenery,\r\nbut they do not as a rule form compounds, and as surnames are usually\r\nfound in their simple form.  Such are Cairn, a stony hill, Crag,\r\nCraig, and the related Carrick and Creagh, Glen or Glynn, and Lynn, a\r\ncascade.  Two words, however, of Celtic origin, don, or down, a hill,\r\nand combe, a hollow in the hills, were adopted by the Anglo-Saxons and\r\nenter into many compounds.  Thus we find Kingdon, whence the imitative\r\nKingdom, Brandon, from the name Brand (Chapter VII), Ashdown, etc.\r\nThe simple Donne or Dunne is sometimes the Anglo-Saxon name Dunna,\r\nwhence Dunning, or a colour nickname, while Down and Downing may\r\nrepresent the Anglo-Sax. Duna and Duning (Chapter VII).  From Combe,\r\nused especially in the west of England, we have Compton, and such\r\ncompounds as Acomb, at combe, Addiscombe, Battiscombe, etc.  But\r\nNewcomb is for Newcome (Chapter II).  See also Slocomb (Chapter XXI).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHILLS\r\n\r\nThe simple Hill and Dale are among our common surnames.  Hill also\r\nappears as Hull and is easily disguised in compounds, e.g. Brummel for\r\nbroom-hill, Tootell and Tuttle for Toothill, a name found in many\r\nlocalities and meaning a hill on which a watch was kept.  It is\r\nconnected with the verb to tout, originally to look out\r\n\r\n\"David dwellide in the tote hil\" (Wyc, 2 Sam. v. 9).\r\n\r\nWe have Dale and its cognate Dell in Swindell (swine), Tindall (Tyne),\r\nTwaddell, Tweddell (Tweed), etc.--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. H. T. Twaddle announced the change of his name to Tweeddale in\r\nthe Times, January 4, 1890\" (Bardsley).\r\n\r\nOther names for a hill are Fell (Scand.), found in the lake country,\r\nwhence Grenfell; and Hough or How (Scand.), as in the north country\r\nnames Greenhow, Birchenough.\r\n\r\nThis is often reduced to -o, as in Clitheroe, Shafto, and is easily\r\nconfused with scough, a wood (Scand.), as in Briscoe (birch), Ayscough\r\n(ash).\r\n\r\nIn the north hills were also called Law and Low, with such compounds\r\nas Bradlaugh, Whitelaw, and Harlow.  To these must be added Barrow,\r\noften confused with the related borough (Chapter XIII).  Both belong\r\nto the Anglo-Sax. beorgan, to protect, cover.  The name Leatherbarrow\r\nmeans the hill, perhaps the burial mound, of Leather, Anglo-Sax.\r\nHlothere, cognate with Lothair and Luther.\r\n\r\nA hill-top was Cope or Copp.  Chaucer uses it of the tip of the\r\nMiller's nose\r\n\r\n\"Upon the cope right of his nose he hade\r\nA werte, and thereon stood a toft of herys.\"\r\n\r\n(A. 554.)\r\n\r\nAnother name for a hill-top appears in Peak, Pike, Peck, or Pick, but\r\nthe many compounds in Pick-, e.g. Pickbourne, Pickford, Pickwick,\r\netc., suggest a personal name Pick of which we have the dim. in\r\nPickett (cf. Fr. Picot) and the softened Piggot.  Peak may be in some\r\ncases from the Derbyshire Peak, which has, however, no connection with\r\nthe common noun peak.  A mere hillock or knoll has given the names\r\nKnapp, Knollys or Knowles, Knock, and Knott.  But Knapp may also be\r\nfor Mid. Eng. nape, cognate with knave and with Low Ger. Knappe,\r\nsquire--\r\n\r\n\"Wer wagt es, Rittersmann oder Knapp'.\r\nZu tauchen in diesen Schlund?\"\r\n\r\n(Schiller, Der Taucher, 1.  I.)\r\n\r\nRedknap, the name of a Richmond boat-builder, is probably a nickname,\r\nlike Redhead.  A Knapper may have lived on a \"knap,\" or may have been\r\none of the Suffolk flint-knappers, who still prepare gun-flints for\r\nweapons to be retailed to the heathen.\r\n\r\nKnock and Knocker are both Kentish names, and there is a reef off\r\nMargate known as the Kentish Knock.  We have the plural Knox (cf. Bax,\r\nSettlements and Enclosures, Chapter XIII).  Knott is sometimes for\r\nCnut, or Canute, which generally becomes Nutt.  Both have got mixed\r\nwith the nickname Nott.\r\n\r\nA green knoll was also called Toft (Scand.), whence Langtoft, and the\r\nname was used later for a homestead.  From Cliff we have Clift,\r\n[Footnote: This may also be from Mid. Eng, clift, a cleft.] with\r\nexcrescent -t, and the cognates Cleeve and Clive.  Compounds of\r\nCliff are Radcliffe (red), Sutcliffe (south), Wyclif (white).  The\r\nc- sometimes disappears in compounds, e.g. Cunliffe, earlier Cunde-clive,\r\nand Topliff; but Ayliffe is for AElfgifu or AEthelgifu and Goodliffe\r\nfrom Godleof (cf. Ger. Gottlieb).  The older form of Stone appears in\r\nStaines, Stanhope, Stanton, etc.  Wheatstone is either for \"white\r\nstone\" or for the local Whetstone (Middlesex).  In Balderstone,\r\nJohnston, Edmondstone, Livingstone, the suffix is -ton, though the\r\nfrequence of Johnston points to corruption from Johnson, just as in\r\nNottingham we have the converse case of Beeson from the local Beeston.\r\nIn Hailstone the first element may be Mid. Eng, half, holy.  Another\r\nMid. English name for a stone appears in Hone, now used only of a\r\nwhetstone.\r\n\r\nA hollow or valley in the hillside was called in the north Clough,\r\nalso spelt Clow, Cleugh (Clim o' the Cleugh), and Clew.  The compound\r\nFairclough is found corrupted into Faircloth.  Another obscure\r\nnorthern name for a glen was Hope, whence Allsop, Blenkinsop, the\r\nfirst element in each being perhaps the name of the first settler, and\r\nBurnup, Hartopp, (hart), Harrap (hare), Heslop (hazel).\r\n\r\nGill (Scand.), a ravine, has given Fothergill, Pickersgill, and\r\nGaskell, from Gaisgill (Westmorland).  These, like most of our names\r\nconnected with mountain scenery, are naturally found almost\r\nexclusively in the north.  Other surnames which belong more or less to\r\nthe hill country are Hole, found also as Holl, Hoole, and Hoyle, but\r\nperhaps meaning merely a depression in the land, Ridge, and its\r\nnorthern form Rigg, with their compounds Doddridge, Langridge,\r\nBrownrigg, Hazelrigg, etc.  Ridge, Rigg, also appear as Rudge, Rugg.\r\nFrom Mid. Eng. raike, a path, a sheep-track (Scand.), we get Raikes\r\nand perhaps Greatorex, found earlier as Greatrakes, the name of a\r\nfamous faith-healer of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODLAND AND PLAIN\r\n\r\nThe compounds of Wood itself are very numerous, e.g. Braidwood,\r\nHarwood, Norwood, Sherrard and Sherratt (Sherwood).  But, in\r\nconsidering the frequency of the simple Wood, it must be remembered\r\nthat we find people described as le wode, i.e. mad (cf. Ger. Wut,\r\nfrenzy), and that mad and madman are found as medieval names\r\n\r\n\"Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;\r\n And here am I, and wode within this wood,\r\n Because I cannot meet my Hermia.\"\r\n\r\n(Midsummer Night's Dream, ii. 1.)\r\n\r\nAs a suffix -wood is sometimes a corruption of -ward, e.g. Haywood is\r\noccasionally for Hayward, and Allwood, Elwood are for Aylward,\r\nAnglo-Sax. AEthelweard.  Another name for a wood was Holt, cognate\r\nwith Ger. Holz--\r\n\r\n\"But right so as thise holtes and thise hayis,\r\n That han in winter dede ben and dreye,\r\n Revesten hem in grene whan that May is.\"\r\n\r\n(Troilus and Criseyde, iii.  351.)\r\n\r\nHurst or Hirst means a wooded hill (cf. Ger. Horst), and Shaw was once\r\nalmost as common a word as wood itself--\r\n\r\n\"Wher rydestow under this grene-wode shawe?\"\r\n\r\n(D, 1386.)\r\n\r\nHurst belongs especially to the south and west, though Hirst is very\r\ncommon in Yorkshire; Shaw is found in the north and Holt in the east\r\nand south.  We have compounds of Shaw in Bradshaw, Crashaw (crow),\r\nHearnshaw (heron), Earnshaw (Mid.  Eng, earn, eagle), Renshaw (raven)\r\n[Footnote: It is obvious that this may also be for raven's haw\r\n(Chapter XIII).  Raven was a common personal name and is the first\r\nelement in Ramsbottom (Chapter XII), Ramsden.], etc., of Hurst in\r\nBuckhurst (beech), Brockhurst (badger), and of Holt in Oakshott.\r\n\r\nWe have earlier forms of Grove in Greaves--\r\n\r\n\"And with his stremes dryeth in the greves\r\n The silver dropes, hangynge on the leves\"\r\n\r\n(A. 1495)--\r\n\r\nand Graves, the latter being thus no more funereal than Tombs, from\r\nThomas (cf. Timbs from Timothy).  But Greaves and Graves may also be\r\nvariants of the official Grieves (Chapter XIX), or may come from Mid.\r\nEng. graefe, a trench, quarry.  Compounds are Hargreave (hare),\r\nRedgrave, Stangrave, the two latter probably referring to an\r\nexcavation.  From Mid. Eng, strope, a small wood, appear to come\r\nStrode and Stroud, compound Bulstrode, while Struthers is the cognate\r\nstrother, marsh, still in dialect use.  Weald and wold, the cognates\r\nof Ger. Wald, were applied rather to wild country in general than to\r\nland covered with trees.  They are probably connected with wild.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the Late Lat. foresta, whence our forest, means only what is\r\noutside, Lat, foris, the town jurisdiction.  From the Mid. Eng. waeld\r\nwe have the names Weld and Weale, the latter with the not uncommon\r\nloss of final -d.  Scroggs (Scand.) and Scrubbs suggest their meaning\r\nof brushwood.  Scroggins, from its form, is a patronymic, and probably\r\nrepresents Scoggins with intrusive _r_.  This is perhaps from Scogin,\r\na name borne by a poet who was contemporary with Chaucer and by a\r\ncourt-fool of the fifteenth century--\r\n\r\n\"The same Sir John, the very same.  I saw him break Skogan's head at\r\nthe court gate, when he was a crack, not thus high.\" (2 Henry IV.,\r\niii.  2.)\r\n\r\nWith Scrubb of cloudy ammonia fame we may compare Wormwood Scrubbs.\r\nShrubb is the same word, and Shropshire is for Anglo-Sax. scrob-scire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST CLEARINGS\r\n\r\nThe two northern names for a clearing in the wood were Royd and\r\nThwaite (Scand.).  The former is cognate with the second part of\r\nBaireut and Wernigerode, and with the Rütli, the small plateau on\r\nwhich the Swiss patriots took their famous oath.  It was so called--\r\n\r\n\"Weil dort die Waldung ausgerodet ward.\"\r\n\r\n(SCHILLER, Wilhelm Tell.)\r\n\r\nAmong its compounds are Ackroyd (oak), Grindrod (green), Murgatroyd\r\n(Margaret), Learoyd (lea), Ormerod, etc.  We also find the name Rodd,\r\nwhich may belong here or to Rudd (Chapter VII), and both these names\r\nmay also be for Rood, equivalent to Cross or Crouch (Chapter II), as\r\nin Holyrood.  Ridding is also related to Royd.  Hacking may be a dim.\r\nof Hack (Chapter VII), but we find also de le hacking, which suggests\r\na forest clearing.\r\n\r\nThwaite,  from Anglo-Sax. þwitan, to cut, is found chiefly in\r\nCumberland and the adjacent region in such compounds as Braithwaite\r\n(broad), Hebbelthwaite, Postlethwaite, Satterthwaite.  The second of\r\nthese is sometimes corrupted into Ablewhite as Cowperthwaite is into\r\nCopperwheat, for \"this suffix has ever been too big a mouthful in the\r\nsouth\" (Bardsley).  A glade or valley in the wood was called a Dean,\r\nDene, Denne, cognate with den.  The compounds are numerous, e.g.\r\nBorden (boar), Dibden (deep), Sugden (Mid.  Eng. suge, sow), Hazeldean\r\nor Heseltine.  From the fact that swine were pastured in these glades\r\nthe names Denman and Denyer have been explained as equivalent to\r\nswineherd.  As a suffix -den is often confused with -don (Chapter\r\nXII).  At the foot of Horsenden Hill, near Harrow, two boards announce\r\nHorsendon Farm and Horsenden Golf-links.  An opening in the wood was\r\nalso called Slade--\r\n\r\n\"And when he came to Barnesdale,\r\n Great heavinesse there hee hadd;\r\n He found two of his fellowes\r\n Were slain both in a Slade.\"\r\n\r\n(Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne.)\r\n\r\nThe maps still show Pond Slade in Richmond Park, The compound Hertslet\r\nmay be for hart-Slade.\r\n\r\nAcre, a field, cognate with, but not derived from, Lat. ager, occurs\r\nin Goodacre, Hardacre, Linacre, Whittaker, etc., and Field itself\r\ngives numerous compounds, including Butterfield (bittern, Chapter\r\nXXIII), Schofield (school), Streatfeild (street), Whitfield.\r\n\r\nPasture-land is represented above all by Lea, for which see Chapter\r\nIII.  It is cognate with Hohenlohe and Waterloo, while Mead and Medd\r\nare cognate with Zermatt (at the mead).  Brinsmead thus means the same\r\nas Brinsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSHES\r\n\r\nMarshy land has given the names Carr or Kerr (Scand.) and Marsh,\r\noriginally an adjective, merisc, from mer, mere.  The doublet Marris\r\nhas usually become Morris.  The compounds Tidmarsh and Titchmarsh\r\ncontain the Anglo-Saxon names Tidda and Ticca.  Moor also originally\r\nhad the meaning morass (e.g. in Sedgemoor), as Ger. Moor still has, so\r\nthat Fenimore is pleonastic.  The northern form is Muir, as in\r\nMuirhead.  Moss was similarly used in the north; cf. moss-trooper and\r\nSolway Moss, but the surname Moss is generally for Moses (Chapter IX).\r\nFrom slough we get the names Slow, Slowley, and Sloman (also perhaps a\r\nnickname), with which we may compare Moorman and Mossman.  This seems\r\nto be also the most usual meaning of Slack or Slagg, also used of a\r\ngap in the hills\r\n\r\n\"The first horse that he rode upon,\r\nFor he was raven black,\r\nHe bore him far, and very far,\r\nBut failed in a slack.\"\r\n\r\n(Ballad of Lady Maisry.)\r\n\r\nTye means common land.  Platt is a piece, or plot, of level country--\r\n\r\n\"Oft on a plat of rising ground\r\n I hear the far-off curfew sound\"\r\n\r\n(Penseroso, 1.  73);\r\n\r\nand shape is expressed by Gore, a triangular piece of land (cf.\r\nKensington Gore), of which the older form Gare, Geare, also survives.\r\nIn Lowndes we have laund or lound--\r\n\r\n\"And to the laund he rideth hym ful right,\r\n For thider was the hart wont have his flight\r\n\r\n(A. 1691)--\r\n\r\na piece of heath land, the origin of the modern word lawn.  In Lund\r\nand Lunn it has become confused with the Old Norse lundr, a sacred\r\ngrove.\r\n\r\nLaund itself is of French origin--\r\n\r\n\"Lande, a land, or laund; a wild, untilled, shrubbie, or bushie\r\nplaine\"\r\n\r\n(Cotgrave).\r\n\r\nIts relation to land is uncertain, and it is not possible to\r\ndistinguish them in such compounds as Acland (Chapter XII), Buckland,\r\nCleveland, etc.  The name Lander or Launder is unconnected with these\r\n(see p.186).  Flack is Mid. Eng. flagge, turf.  Snape is a dialect\r\nword for boggy ground, and Wong means a meadow.\r\n\r\nA rather uncouth-looking set of names, which occur chiefly on the\r\nborder of Cheshire and Lancashire, are compounded from bottom or\r\nbotham, a wide shallow valley suited for agriculture.  Hotspur,\r\ndissatisfied with his fellow-conspirators' map-drawing, expresses his\r\nintention of damming the Trent so that\r\n\r\n\"It shall not wind with such a deep indent\r\n To rob me of so rich a bottom here.\"\r\n\r\n(1 Henry IV, iii.  1.)\r\n\r\nFamiliar compounds are Higginbottom, Rowbotham, Sidebottom.  The first\r\nelement of Shufflebotham is, in the Lancashire Assize Rolls\r\n(1176-1285), spelt Schyppewalle- and Schyppewelle-, where schyppe is\r\nfor sheep, still so pronounced in dialect.  Tarbottom, earlier\r\nTarbutton, is corrupted from Tarbolton (Ayrshire).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER AND WATERSIDE\r\n\r\nRIVERS\r\n\r\nVery few surnames are taken, in any language, from the names of\r\nrivers.  This is quite natural, for just as the man who lived on a\r\nhill became known as Hill, Peake, etc., and not as Skiddaw or Wrekin,\r\nso the man who lived by the waterside would be known as Bywater,\r\nRivers, etc.  No Londoner talks of going on the Thames, and the\r\ncountry-dweller also usually refers to his local stream as the river\r\nor the water, and not by its geographical name.  Another reason for\r\nthe absence of such surnames is probably to be found in the fact that\r\nour river (and mountain) names are almost exclusively Celtic, and had\r\nno connotation for the English population.  We have many apparent\r\nriver names, but most of them are susceptible of another explanation.\r\nDee may be for Day as Deakin is for Dakin, i.e. David, Derwent looks\r\nlike Darwin (Chapter VII) or the local Darwen with excrescent -t\r\n(Chapter III), Humber is Humbert, a French name corresponding to the\r\nAnglo-Sax, Hunbeorht, Medway may be merely \"mid-way,\" and Trent is a\r\nplace in Somerset.  This view as to river surnames is supported by the\r\nfact that we do not appear to have a single mountain surname, the\r\napparent exception, Snowdon, being for Snowden (see den, Dean, Dene,\r\nDenne).  [Footnote: But see my Surnames, Chapter XVI.]\r\n\r\nAmong names for streams we have Beck, [Footnote: The simple Beck is\r\ngenerally a German name of modern introduction (see pecch).]  cognate\r\nwith Ger. Bach; Bourne, [Footnote: Distinct from bourne, a boundary,\r\nFr. borne.] or Burn, cognate with Ger. Brunnen; Brook, related to\r\nbreak; Crick, a creek; Fleet, a creek, cognate with Flood; and Syke, a\r\ntrench or rill.  In Beckett and Brockett the suffix is head (Chapter\r\nXIII).  Troutbeck, Birkbeck explain themselves.  In Colbeck we have\r\ncold, and Holbrook contains hollow, but in some names -brook has been\r\nsubstituted for -borough, -burgh.  We find Brook latinized as Torrens.\r\nAborn is for atte bourne, and there are probably many places called\r\nBlackburn and Otterburn.\r\n\r\nFirth, an estuary, cognate with fjord, often becomes Frith, but this\r\nsurname usually comes from frith, a park or game preserve (Chapter\r\nXIII).\r\n\r\nAnother word for a creek, wick or wick (Scand.), cannot be\r\ndistinguished from wick, a settlement.  Pond, a doublet of Pound\r\n(Chapter XIII), means a piece of water enclosed by a dam, while\r\nnatural sheets of water are Lake, or Lack, not limited originally to a\r\nlarge expanse, Mere, whence Mears and such compounds as Cranmer\r\n(crane), Bulmer (bull), etc., and Pool, also spelt Pull and Pole.  We\r\nhave compounds of the latter in Poulton (Chapter I), Claypole, and\r\nGlasspool.\r\n\r\nIn Kent a small pond is called Sole, whence Nethersole.  The bank of a\r\nriver or lake was called Over, cognate with Ger. Ufer, whence Overend,\r\nOverall (see below), Overbury, Overland.  The surname Shore, for atte\r\nshore, may refer to the sea-shore, but the word sewer was once\r\nregularly so pronounced and the name was applied to large drains in\r\nthe fen country (cf. Gott, Water, Chapter XIII).  Beach is a word of\r\nlate appearance and doubtful origin, and as a surname is usually\r\nidentical with Beech.\r\n\r\nSpits of land by the waterside were called Hook  (cf. Hook of Holland\r\nand Sandy Hook) and Hoe or Hoo, as in Plymouth Hoe, or the Hundred of\r\nHoo, between the Thames and the Medway.  From Hook comes Hooker, where\r\nit does not mean a maker of hooks, while Homan and Hooman sometimes\r\nbelong to the second.  Alluvial land by a stream was called halgh,\r\nhaugh, whence sometimes Hawes.  Its dative case gives Hale and Heal.\r\nThese often become -hall, -all, in place-names.  Compounds are\r\nGreenhalgh, Greenall and Featherstonehaugh, perhaps our longest\r\nsurname.\r\n\r\nIng, a low-lying meadow, Mid. Eng. eng, survives in Greening, Fenning,\r\nWilding, and probably sometimes in England (Chapter XI).  But Inge and\r\nIngs, the latter the name of one of the Cato Street conspirators, also\r\nrepresent an Anglo-Saxon personal name.  Cf. Ingall and Ingle, from\r\nIngwulf, or Ingold, whence Ingoldsby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISLANDS\r\n\r\nEy, an island, [Footnote: Isle of Sheppey, Mersea Island, etc, are\r\npleonasms.]survives as the last element of many names, and is not\r\nalways to be distinguished from hey (hay, Settlements, Chapter III)\r\nand ley.  Bill Nye's ancestor lived atten ey (Chapter III).  Dowdney\r\nor Dudeney has been explained from the Anglo-Saxon name Duda, but it\r\nmore probably represents the very common French name Dieudonné,\r\ncorresponding to Lat. Deodatus.  In the north a river island was\r\ncommonly called Holm (Scand.), also pronounced Home, Hulme, and Hume,\r\nin compounds easily confused with -ham, e.g. Durham was once\r\nDun-holmr, hill island.  The very common Holmes is probably in most\r\ncases a tree-name (Chapter XII).  In Chisholm the first element may\r\nmean pebble; cf. Chesil Beach.  The names Bent, whence Broadbent, and\r\nCrook probably also belong sometimes to the river, but may have arisen\r\nfrom a turn in a road or valley.  But Bent was also applied to a tract\r\ncovered with bents, or rushes, and Crook is generally a nickname\r\n(Chapter XXII).  Lastly, the crossing of the unbridged stream has\r\ngiven us Ford or Forth whence Stratford, Strafford (street), Stanford,\r\nStamford, Staniforth (stone), etc.  The alternative name was Wade,\r\nwhence the compound Grimwade.  The cognate wath (Scand.) has been\r\nconfused with with (Scand.), a wood, whence the name Wythe and the\r\ncompound Askwith or Asquith.  Both -wath and -with have been often\r\nreplaced by -worth and -wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE NAMES\r\n\r\nIn conclusion a few words must be said about tree names, so common in\r\ntheir simple form and in topographical compounds.  Here, as in the\r\ncase of most of the etymons already mentioned in this chapter, the\r\norigin of the surname may be specific as well as general, i.e. the\r\nname Ash may come from Ash in Kent rather than from any particular\r\ntree, the etymology remaining the same.  Many of our surnames have\r\npreserved the older forms of tree names, e.g. the lime was once the\r\nline, hence Lines, Lynes, and earlier still the Lind, as in the\r\ncompounds Lyndhurst, Lindley, etc.  The older form of Oak appears in\r\nAcland, Acton, and variants in Ogden and Braddock, broad oak.  We have\r\nash in Aston, Ascham.  The holly was once the hollin, whence Hollins,\r\nHollis, Hollings; cf. Hollings-head, Holinshed.  But hollin became\r\ncolloquially holm, whence generally Holmes.  Homewood is for\r\nholm-wood.  The holm oak, ilex, is so called from its holly-like\r\nleaves.  For Birch we also find Birk, a northern form.  Beech often\r\nappears in compounds as Buck-; cf. buckwheat, so called because the\r\ngrains are of the shape of beech-mast.  In Poppleton, Popplewell we\r\nhave the dialect popple, a poplar.  Yeo sometimes represents yew,\r\nspelt yowe by Palsgrave.  [Footnote: The yeo of yeoman, which is\r\nconjectured to have meant district, cognate with Ger. Gau in Breisgau,\r\nRheingau, etc., is not found by itself.]\r\n\r\nIn Sallows we have a provincial name for the willow, cognate with Fr,\r\nsaule and Lat. salix.  Rowntree is the rowan, or mountain ash, and\r\nBawtry or Bawtree is a northern name for the elder.  The older forms\r\nof Alder and Elder, in both of which the _d_ is intrusive (Chapter\r\nIII), appear in Allerton and Ellershaw.  Maple is sometimes Mapple and\r\nsycamore is corrupted into Sicklemore.\r\n\r\nTree-names are common in all languages.  Beerbohm Tree is pleonastic,\r\nfrom Ger. Bierbaum, for Birnbaum, pear-tree.  A few years ago a\r\nprominent Belgian statesman bore the name Vandenpereboom, rather\r\nterrifying till decomposed into \"van den pereboom.\" Its Mid. English\r\nequivalent appears in Pirie, originally a collection of pear-trees,\r\nbut used by Chaucer for the single tree\r\n\r\n\"And thus I lete hym sitte upon the pyrie.\"\r\n\r\n(E. 2217.)\r\n\r\nFrom trees we may descend gradually, via Thorne, Bush, Furze, Gorst\r\n(Chapter I), Ling, etc., until we come finally to Grace, which in some\r\ncases represents grass, for we find William atte grase in 1327, while\r\nthe name Poorgrass, in Mr. Hardy's Far from the Madding Crowd, seems\r\nto be certified by the famous French names Malherbe and Malesherbes.\r\nBut Savory is the French personal name Savary.\r\n\r\nThe following list of trees is given by Chaucer in the Knight's tale--\r\n\r\n\"The names that the trees highte,--\r\n As ook, firre, birch, aspe, alder, holm, popeler,\r\n Wylugh, elm, plane, assh, box, chasteyn, lynde, laurer,\r\n Mapul, thorn, beck, hasel, ew, whippeltre.\"  (A. 2920.)\r\n\r\nThey are all represented in modern directories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. THE HAUNTS OF MAN\r\n\r\n\"One fels downs firs, another of the same\r\n With crossed poles a little lodge doth frame:\r\n Another mounds it with dry wall about,\r\n And leaves a breach for passage in and out:\r\n With turfs and furze some others yet more gross\r\n Their homely sties in stead of walls inclose:\r\n Some, like the swallow, mud and hay doe mixe\r\n And that about their silly [p.  209] cotes they fixe\r\n Some heals [thatch] their roofer with fearn, or reeds, or rushes,\r\n And some with hides, with oase, with boughs, and bushes,\"\r\n\r\n(SYLVESTER, The Devine Weekes, )\r\n\r\nIn almost every case where man has interfered with nature the\r\nresulting local name is naturally of Anglo-Saxon or, in some parts of\r\nEngland, of Scandinavian origin.  The Roman and French elements in our\r\ntopographical names are scanty in number, though the former are of\r\nfrequent occurrence.  The chief Latin contributions are -Chester,\r\n-cester, -caster, Lat. castrum, a fort, or plural castra, a camp;\r\n-street, Lat. via strata, a levelled way; -minster, Lat. monasterium;\r\nand -church or -kirk, Greco-Lat. kuriakon, belonging to the Lord.\r\nEccles, Greco-Lat. ecclesia, probably goes back to Celtic\r\nChristianity.  Street was the high-road, hence Greenstreet.  Minster\r\nis curiously corrupted in Buckmaster for Buckminster and Kittermaster\r\nfor Kidderminster, while in its simple form it appears as Minister\r\n(Chapter III).\r\n\r\nWe have a few French place-names, e.g. Beamish (Chapter XIV),\r\nBeaumont, Richmond, Richemont, and Malpas (Cheshire), the evil pass,\r\nwith which we may compare Maltravers.  We have the apparent opposite\r\nin Bompas, Bumpus, Fr. bon pas, but this was a nickname.  Of late\r\nthere has been a tendency to introduce the French ville, e.g.\r\nBournville, near Birmingham.  That part of Margate which ought to be\r\ncalled Northdown is known as Cliftonville, and the inhabitants of the\r\nopposite end of the town, dissatisfied with such good names as\r\nWestbrook and Rancorn, hanker after Westonville.  But these\r\nphilological atrocities are fortunately too late to be perpetuated as\r\nsurnames.\r\n\r\nI have divided the names in this chapter into those that are connected\r\nwith\r\n\r\n(1)  Settlements and Enclosures,\r\n\r\n(2)  Highways and Byways,\r\n\r\n(3)  Watercourses,\r\n\r\n(4)  Buildings,\r\n\r\n(5)  Shop Signs.\r\n\r\nAnd here, as before, names which neither in their simple nor compound\r\nform present any difficulty are omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENTS AND ENCLOSURES\r\n\r\nThe words which occur most commonly in the names of the modern towns\r\nwhich have sprung from early homesteads are borough or bury,\r\n[Footnote: Originally the dative of borough.]  by, ham, stoke, stow,\r\nthorp, tun or ton, wick, and worth.  These names are all of native\r\norigin, except by, which indicates a Danish settlement, and wick,\r\nwhich is supposed to be a very early loan from Lat. vicus, cognate\r\nwith Greek oikos, house.  Nearly all of them are common, in their\r\nsimple form, both as specific place-names and as surnames.  Borough,\r\ncognate with Ger. Burg, castle, and related to Barrow (Chapter XII),\r\nhas many variants, Bury, Brough, Borrow, Berry, whence Berryman, and\r\nBurgh, the last of which has become Burke in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn Atterbury the preposition and article have both remained, while in\r\nThornber the suffix is almost unrecognizable.  By, related to byre and\r\nto the preposition by, is especially common in Yorkshire and\r\nLincolnshire.  It is sometimes spelt bee, e.g. Ashbee for Ashby.  The\r\nsimple Bye is not uncommon.  Ham is cognate with home.  In compounds\r\nit is sometimes reduced to -um, e.g. Barnum, Holtum, Warnum.  But in\r\nsome such names the -um is the original form, representing an old\r\ndative plural (Chapter III).  Allum represents the usual Midland\r\npronunciation of Hallam.  Cullum, generally for Culham, may also\r\nrepresent the missionary Saint Colomb.  In Newnham the adjective is\r\ndative, as in Ger. Neuenheim, at the new home.  In Bonham, Frankham,\r\nand Pridham the suffix -ham has been substituted for the French homme\r\nof bonhomme, franc homme, prudhomme, while Jerningham is a perversion\r\nof the personal name Jernegan or Gernegan, as Garnham is of Gernon,\r\nOld French for Beard (Chapter XXI).  Stead is cognate with Ger. Stadt,\r\nplace, town, and with staith, as in Bickersteth(Chapter III).\r\nArmstead means the dwelling of the hermit, Bensted the stead of Benna\r\n(Chapter VII) or Bennet.\r\n\r\nStoke is originally distinct from Stock, a stump, with which it has\r\nbecome fused in the compounds Bostock, Brigstocke.  Stow appears in\r\nthe compound Bristol (Chapter XI) and in Plaistow, play-ground (cf.\r\nPlaysted).  Thorp, cognate with Ger. Dorf, village, is especially\r\ncommon in the eastern counties\r\n\r\n\"By twenty thorps, a little town,\r\n And half a hundred bridges.\"\r\n\r\n(Tennyson, The Brook, 1.  5.)\r\n\r\nIt has also given Thrupp and probably Thripp, whence Calthrop,\r\nWinthrop, Westrupp, etc.\r\n\r\nTon, later Town, gave also the northern Toon, still used in Scotland\r\nwith something of its original sense (Chapter XII).  Boston is\r\nBotolf's town, Gunston Gunolf's town.  So also Tarleton (Thurweald),\r\nMonkton (monk), Preston (priest).  Barton meant originally a\r\nbarley-field, and is still used in the west of England for a paddock.\r\nWick appears also as Wych, Weech.  Its compounds cannot be separated\r\nfrom those of wick, a creek (Chapter XII).  Bromage is for Bromwich,\r\nGreenidge for Greenwich, Prestage for Prestwich; cf. the place-name\r\nSwanage (Dorset), earlier Swanewic.\r\n\r\nWorth was perhaps originally applied to land by a river or to a holm\r\n(Chapter XII); cf. Ger. Donauwert, Nonnenwert, etc.  Harmsworth is for\r\nHarmondsworth; cf. Ebbsworth (Ebba), Shuttleworth (Sceotweald),\r\nWadsworth (Wada).  Sometimes we find a lengthened form, e.g.\r\nAllworthy, from ald, old (cf. Aldworth), Langworthy.  Rickworth,\r\nfurther corrupted to Record, is the Anglo-Saxon name Ricweard.\r\nLittleworth may belong to this class, but may also be a nickname.\r\nThis would make it equivalent to the imitative Little-proud, formerly\r\nLittleprow, from Old French and Mid. Eng. prou, worth, value.\r\n\r\nTo this group may be added two more, which signify a mart, viz. Cheap\r\nor Chipp (cf. Chepstow, Chipping Barnet) and Staple, whence Huxtable,\r\nStapleton, etc.  Liberty, that part of a city which, though outside\r\nthe walls, shares in the city privileges, and Parish also occur as\r\nsurnames, but the latter is usually for Paris.\r\n\r\nMany other words connected with the delimitation of property occur\r\ncommonly in surnames.  Croft or Craft, a small field, is common in\r\ncompounds such as Beecroft or Bearcroft (barley), Haycraft (see hay,\r\nbelow),  Oscroft(ox), Rycroft, Meadowcroft. [Footnote: I remember\r\nreading in some story of a socially ambitious lady who adopted this\r\ncommonplace name instead of Gubbins.  The latter name came over, as\r\nGobin, with the Conqueror, and goes back to Old Ger. Godberaht, whence\r\nOld Fr. Godibert.] Fold occurs usually as Foulds, but we have\r\ncompounds such as Nettlefold, Penfold or Pinfold (Chapter XIII).  Sty,\r\nnot originally limited to pigs, has given Hardisty, the sty of\r\nHeardwulf.  Frith, a park or game preserve, is probably more often the\r\norigin of a surname than the other frith (Chapter XII).  It is cognate\r\nwith Ger. Friedhof, cemetery.  Chase is still used of a park and Game\r\nonce meant rabbit-warren.  Warren is Fr. garenne.  Garth, the\r\nScandinavian doublet of Yard, and cognate with Garden, has given the\r\ncompounds Garside, Garfield, Hogarth (from a place in Westmorland),\r\nand Applegarth, of which Applegate is a corruption.  We have a\r\ncompound of yard in Wynyard, Anglo-Sax. win, vine.  We have also the\r\nname Close and its derivative Clowser.  Gate, a barrier or opening,\r\nAnglo-Sax. geat, is distinct from the Scandinavian gate, a street\r\n(Chapter XIII), though of course confused with it in surnames.  From\r\nthe northern form we have Yates, Yeats, and Yeatman, and the compounds\r\nByatt, by gate, Hyatt, high gate.  Agate is for atte gate, and\r\nLidgate, whence Lidgett, means a swing gate, shutting like a lid.\r\nFladgate is for flood-gate.  Here also belongs Barr.  Hatch, the gate\r\nat the entrance to a chase, survives in Colney Hatch.  The apparent\r\ndim. Hatchett is for Hatchard (Chapter VIII); cf. Everett for Everard\r\n(Chapter II).  Hay, also Haig, Haigh, Haw, Hey, is cognate with Hedge.\r\nLike most monosyllabic local surnames, it is commonly found in the\r\nplural, Hayes, Hawes.  The bird nickname Hedgecock exists also as\r\nHaycock.  The curious-looking patronymics Townson and Orchardson are\r\nof course corrupt.  The former is for Tomlinson and the latter perhaps\r\nfrom Achard (Chapter VIII).\r\n\r\nSeveral places and families in England are named Hide or Hyde, which\r\nmeant a certain measure of land.  The popular connection between this\r\nword and hide, a skin, as in the story of the first Jutish settlement,\r\nis a fable.  It is connected with an Anglo-Saxon word meaning\r\nhousehold, which appears also in Huish, Anglo-Sax. hi-wisc.  Dike, or\r\nDyke, and Moat, also Mott, both have, or had, a double meaning.  We\r\nstill use dike, which belongs to dig and ditch, both of a trench and a\r\nmound, and the latter was the earlier meaning of Fr. motte, now a\r\nclod, In Anglo-French we find moat used of a mound fortress in a\r\nmarsh.  Now it is applied to the surrounding water.  From dike come\r\nthe names Dicker, Dickman, Grimsdick, etc.  Sometimes the name Dykes\r\nmay imply residence near some historic earthwork, such as Offa's Dyke,\r\njust as Wall, for which Waugh was used in the north, may show\r\nconnection with the Roman wall.  With these may be mentioned the\r\nFrench name Fosse, whence the apparently pleonastic Fosdyke and the\r\nname of Verdant Green's friend, Mr. Four-in-hand Fosbrooke.  Delves is\r\nfrom Mid. Eng. dell, ditch.  Jury is for Jewry, the quarter allotted\r\nto the Jews, but Jewsbury is no doubt for Dewsbury; cf. Jewhurst for\r\nDewhurst.\r\n\r\nHere may be mentioned a few local surnames which are hard to classify.\r\nWe have the apparently anatomical Back, Foot, Head, and, in compounds,\r\n-side.  Back seems to have been used of the region behind a building\r\nor dwelling, as it still is at Cambridge.  Its plural has given Bax.\r\nBut it was also a personal name connected with Bacon (Chapter XXIII).\r\n\r\nWe should expect Foot to mean the base of a hill, but it always occurs\r\nin early rolls without a preposition.  It may represent in some cases\r\nan old personal name of obscure origin, but it is also a nickname with\r\ncompounds such as Barfoot, Lightfoot.  The simple Head, found as Mid.\r\nEng. del heved, is perhaps generally from a shop sign.  Fr. Tête, one\r\norigin of Tait, Tate, and Ger. Haupt, Kopf, also occur as surnames.\r\nAs a local suffix -head appears to mean top-end and is generally\r\nshortened to -ett, e.g. Birkett (cf. Birkenhead), [Footnote: No doubt\r\nsometimes, like Burchett, Burkett, for the personal name Burchard,\r\nAnglo-Sax. Burgheard]  Brockett (brook), Bromet, Bromhead (broom),\r\nHazlitt (hazel).  The same suffix appears to be present in Fossett,\r\nfrom fosse, and Forcett from force, a waterfall (Scand.).  Broadhead\r\nis a nickname, like Fr. Grossetête and Ger. Breitkopf.  The face-value\r\nof Evershed is boar's head.  Morshead may be the nickname of mine host\r\nof the Saracen's Head or may mean the end of the moor.  So the names\r\nAked (oak), Blackett, Woodhead may be explained anatomically or\r\ngeographically according to the choice of the bearer.  Perrett,\r\nusually a dim. of Peter, may sometimes represent the rather effective\r\nold nickname \"pear-head.\"\r\n\r\nSide is local in the uncomfortable sounding Akenside (oak), Fearenside\r\n(fern), but Heaviside appears to be a nickname.  Handyside may mean\r\n\"gracious manner,\" from Mid. Eng. side, cognate with Ger. Sitte,\r\ncustom.  See Hendy (Chapter XXII).  The simple end survives as Ind or\r\nNind (Chapter III) and in Overend (Chapter XII), Townsend.  Edge\r\nappears also in the older form Egg, but the frequency of place-names\r\nbeginning with Edge, e.g. Edgeley, Edgington, Edgworth, etc., suggests\r\nthat it was also a personal name.\r\n\r\nLynch, a boundary, is cognate with golf-links.  The following sounds\r\nmodern, but refers to people sitting in a hollow among the\r\nsand-ridges--\r\n\r\n\"And are ye in the wont of drawing up wi' a' the gangrel bodies that\r\nye find cowering in a sand-bunker upon the links?\"\r\n\r\n(Redgauntlet, ch. xi.)\r\n\r\nPitt is found in the compound Bulpitt, no doubt the place where the\r\ntown bull was kept.  It is also the origin of the Kentish names Pett\r\nand Pettman (Chapter XVII).  Arch refers generally to a bridge.\r\nLastly, there are three words for a corner, viz. Hearne, Herne, Hurne,\r\nHorn; Wyke, the same word as Wick, a creek (Chapter XII); and Wray\r\n(Scand.).  The franklin tell us that \"yonge clerkes\" desirous of\r\nknowledge--\r\n\r\n\"Seken in every halke and every herne\r\n Particular sciences for to lerne\"\r\n\r\n(F, 1119).\r\n\r\nWray has become confused with Ray (Chapter III).  Its compound\r\nthack-wray, the corner where the thatch was stored, has given\r\nThackeray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS\r\n\r\nThe word road was not used in its current sense during the surname\r\nperiod, but meant the art of riding, and specifically a raid or\r\ninroad.  Therefore the name Roades is unconnected with it and\r\nrepresents merely a variant of Royds (Chapter XII).  This name and its\r\ncompounds belong essentially to the north, the prevailing spelling,\r\nRhodes, being artificial.  It has no connection with the island of\r\nRhodes.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of Street has changed considerably since the days when\r\nIcknield Street and Watling Street were great national roads.  It is\r\nnow used exclusively of town thoroughfares, and has become such a mere\r\nsuffix that, while we speak of the Oxford Róad, we try to suppress the\r\nsecond word in Ox'ford Street.  To street belong our place-names and\r\nsurnames in Strat-, Stret-, etc., e.g. Stratton, Stretton, Stredwick.\r\nWay has a number of compounds with intrusive _a_, e.g. Challaway,\r\nDallaway (dale), Greenaway, Hathaway (heath), Westaway.  But Hanway is\r\nthe name of a country (Chapter XI), and Otway, Ottoway, is Old Fr.\r\nOtouet, a dim. of Odo.  Shipway is for sheep-way.  In the north of\r\nEngland the streets in a town are often called gates (Scand.).  It is\r\nimpossible to distinguish the compounds of this gate from those of the\r\nnative gate, a barrier (Chapter XIII), e.g. Norgate may mean North\r\nStreet or North Gate.\r\n\r\nAlley and Court both exist as surnames, but the former is for a'lee,\r\ni.e. Atlee (Chapter XII), and the latter is from court in the sense of\r\nmansion, country house.  The curious spelling Caught may be seen over\r\na shop in Chiswick.  Rowe (Chapter I) sometimes means row of houses,\r\nbut in Townroe the second element is identical with Wray (Chapter\r\nXIII).  Cosway, Cossey, is from causeway, Fr. chaussée; and Twitchers,\r\nTwitchell represent dialect words used of a narrow passage and\r\nconnected with the Mid. English verb twiselen, to fork, or divide;\r\nTwiss must be of similar origin, for we find Robert del twysse in\r\n1367.  Cf. Birtwistle and Entwistle.  With the above may be classed\r\nthe west-country Shute, a narrow street; Vennell, a north-country word\r\nfor alley, Fr. venelle, dim. of Lat. versa, vein; Wynd, a court, also\r\na north-country word, probably from the verb wind, to twist; and the\r\ncognate Went, a passage--\r\n\r\n\"Thorugh a goter, by a prive wente.\"\r\n\r\n(Troilus and Criseyde, iii.  788.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER\r\n\r\nNames derived from artificial watercourses are Channell, now replaced\r\nas a common noun by the learned form canal; Condy or Cundy, for the\r\nearlier Cunditt, conduit; Gott, cognate with gut, used in Yorkshire\r\nfor the channel from a mill-dam, and in Lincolnshire for a water-drain\r\non the coast; Lade, Leete, connected with the verb to lead; and\r\nsometimes Shore (Chapter XII), which was my grandfather's\r\npronunciation of sewer.  From weir, lit.  a protection, precaution,\r\ncognate with beware and Ger. wehren, to protect, we have not only\r\nWeir, but also Ware, Warr, Wear, and the more pretentious Delawarr.\r\nThe latter name passed from an Earl Delawarr to a region in North\r\nAmerica, and thus to Fenimore Cooper's noble red men.  But this group\r\nof names must sometimes be referred to the Domesday wars, an outlying\r\npotion of a manor.  Lock is more often a land name, to be classed with\r\nHatch (Chapter XIII), but was also used of a water-gate.  Key was once\r\nthe usual spelling of quay.  The curious name Keylock is a perversion\r\nof Kellogg, Mid. Eng. Kill-hog.  Port seldom belongs here, as the Mid.\r\nEnglish is almost always de la Porte, i.e. Gates.  From well we have a\r\nvery large number of compounds, e.g. Cauldwell (cold), Halliwell, the\r\nvariants of which, Holliwell, Hollowell, probably all represent Mid.\r\nEng. hali, holy.  Here belongs also Winch, from the device used for\r\ndrawing water from deep wells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDINGS\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the words to be dealt with under this heading\r\nenter into the composition of specific place-names.  A considerable\r\nnumber of surnames are derived from the names of religious buildings,\r\nusually from proximity rather than actual habitation.  Such names are\r\nnaturally of Greco-Latin origin, and were either introduced directly\r\ninto Anglo-Saxon by the missionaries, or were adopted later in a\r\nFrench form after the Conquest.  It has already been noted (Chapter I)\r\nthat Abbey is not always what it seems; but in some cases it is local,\r\nfrom Fr, abbaye, of which the Provençal form Abadie was introduced by\r\nthe Huguenots.  We find much earlier Abdy, taken straight from the\r\nGreco-Lat. abbatia.  The famous name Chantrey is for chantry, Armitage\r\nwas once the regular pronunciation of Hermitage, and Chappell a common\r\nspelling of Chapel--\r\n\r\n\"Also if you finde not the word you seeke for presently after one sort\r\nof spelling, condemne me not forthwith, but consider how it is used to\r\nbe spelled, whether with double or single letters, as Chappell, or\r\nChapell\" (Holyoak, Latin Dict., 1612).\r\n\r\nWe have also the Norman form Capel, but this may be a nickname from\r\nMid. Eng. capel, nag--\r\n\r\n\"Why nadstow (hast thou not) pit the capul in the lathe (barn)?\" (A,\r\n4088.)\r\n\r\nA Galilee was a chapel or porch devoted to special purposes--\r\n\r\n\"Those they pursued had taken refuge in the galilee of the church\"\r\n\r\n(Fair Maid of Perth, ch. ix.).\r\n\r\nThe tomb of the Venerable Bede is in the Galilee of Durham Cathedral.\r\nI had a schoolfellow with this uncommon name, now generally perverted\r\nto Galley.  In a play now running (Feb.  1913) in London, there is a\r\ncharacter named Sanctuary, a name found also in Crockford and the\r\nLondon Directory.\r\n\r\nI have only once come across the contracted form Sentry [Footnote: On\r\nthe development in meaning of this word, first occurring in the phrase\r\n\"to take sentrie,\" i.e. refuge, see my Romance of Words, ch. vii.]\r\n(Daily Telegraph, Dec.  26, 1912), and then under circumstances which\r\nmight make quotation actionable.  Purvis is Mid. Eng. parvis, a porch,\r\nGreco-Lat. paradises.  It may be the same as Provis, the name selected\r\nby Mr. Magwitch on his return from the Antipodes (Great Expectations,\r\nch. xl.), unless this is for Provost.  Porch and Portch both occur as\r\nsurnames, but Porcher is Fr. porcher, a swineherd, and Portal is a\r\nHuguenot name.  Churcher and Kirker, Churchman and Kirkman, are\r\nusually local; cf. Bridges and Bridgman.\r\n\r\nThe names Temple and Templeman were acquired from residence near one\r\nof the preceptories of the Knights Templars, and Spittlehouse (Chapter\r\nIII) is sometimes to be accounted for in a similar way (Knights of the\r\nHospital).  We even find the surname Tabernacle.  Musters is Old Fr.\r\nmoustiers (moutiers), common in French place-names, from Lat.\r\nmonasterium.  The word bow, still used for an arch in some old towns,\r\nhas given the names Bow and Bowes.  A medieval statute, recently\r\nrevived to baffle the suffragettes, was originally directed against\r\nrobbers and \"pillers,\" i.e. plunderers, but the name Piller is also\r\nfor pillar; cf. the French name Colonise.  With these may be mentioned\r\nButtress and Carvell, the latter from Old Fr. carnet (créneau), a\r\nbattlement.\r\n\r\nAs general terms for larger dwellings we find Hall, House, also\r\nwritten Hose, and Seal, the last-named from the Teutonic original\r\nwhich has given Fr. Lasalle, whence our surname Sale.  To the same\r\nclass belong Place, Plaice, as in Cumnor Place.\r\n\r\nThe possession of such surnames does not imply ancestral possession of\r\nHaddon Hall, Stafford House, etc., but merely that the founder of the\r\nfamily lived under the shadow of greatness.  In compounds -house is\r\ngenerally treated as in \"workus,\" e.g. Bacchus (Chapter VIII),\r\nBellows, Brewis, Duffus (dove), Kirkus, Loftus, Malthus, Windus (wynd,\r\nChapter XIII).  In connection with Woodhouse it must be remembered\r\nthat this name was given to the man who played the part of a \"wild man\r\nof the woods\" in processions and festivities.  William Power, skinner,\r\ncalled \"Wodehous,\" died in London in 1391.  Of similar origin is\r\nGreenman.  The tavern sign of the Green Man is sometimes explained as\r\nrepresenting a forester in green, but it was probably at first\r\nequivalent to the German sign \"Zum wilden Mann.\" Cassell is sometimes\r\nfor Castle, but is more often a local German name of recent\r\nintroduction.  The northern Peel, a castle, as in the Isle of Man, was\r\noriginally applied to a stockade, Old Fr. pel (pieu), a stake, Lat.\r\nPalos.  Hence also Peall, Peile.  Keep comes from the central tower of\r\nthe castle, where the baron and his family kept, i.e. lived.  A moated\r\nGrange is a poetic figment, for the word comes from Fr, grange, a barn\r\n(to Lat. granum); hence Granger.\r\n\r\nWith Mill and the older Milne (Chapter II) we may compare Mullins, Fr.\r\nDesmoulins.  Barnes is sometimes, but not always, what it seems\r\n(Chapter XXI).  With it we may put Leathes, from an obsolete\r\nScandinavian word for barn (see quot. Chapter XIII), to which we owe\r\nalso the names Leatham and Latham.  Mr. Oldbuck's \"ecstatic\r\ndescription\" of the Roman camp with its praetorium was spoilt by Edie\r\nOchiltree's disastrous interruption\r\n\r\n\"Praetorian here, praetorian there, I mind the bigging o't.\"\r\n(Antiquary, ch. iv.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDWELLINGS\r\n\r\nThe obsolete verb to big, i.e. build, whence Biggar, a builder, has\r\ngiven us Biggins, Biggs (Chapter III), and Newbigging, while from to\r\nbuild we have Newbould and Newbolt.  Cazenove, Ital. casa nuova, means\r\nexactly the same.  Probably related to build is the obsolete Bottle, a\r\nbuilding, whence Harbottle.  A humble dwelling was called a Board--\r\n\r\nBorde, a little house, lodging, or cottage of timber (Cotgrave)--\r\n\r\nwhence Boardman, Border.  Other names were Booth, Lodge, and Folley,\r\nFr. feuillée, a hut made of branches--\r\n\r\n\"Feuillée, an arbor, or bower, framed of leav'd plants, or branches\"\r\n(Cotgrave).\r\n\r\nScale, possibly connected with shealing, is a Scandinavian word used\r\nin the north for a shepherd's hut, hence the surname Scales.  Bower,\r\nwhich now suggests a leafy arbour, had no such sense in Mid. English.\r\nChaucer says of the poor widow--\r\n\r\n\"Ful sooty was hir bour and eek hire halle.\"\r\n\r\n(B, 4022.)\r\n\r\nHence the names Bowerman, Boorman, Burman.\r\n\r\nBut the commonest of names for a humble dwelling was cot or cote\r\n\r\nBorn and fed in rudenesse\r\n\r\nAs in a cote or in an oxe stalle\r\n\r\n(E, 397)\r\n\r\nthe inhabitant of which was a Colman, Cotter, or, diminutively,\r\nCottrell, Cotterill.  Hence the frequent occurrence of the name\r\nCoates.\r\n\r\nThere are also numerous compounds, e.g. Alcott (old), Norcott,\r\nKingscote, and the many variants of Caldecott, Calcott, the cold\r\ndwelling, especially common as a village name in the vicinity of the\r\nRoman roads.  It is supposed to have been applied, like Coldharbour,\r\nto deserted posts.  The name Cotton is sometimes from the dative\r\nplural of the same word, though, when of French origin, it represents\r\nColon, dim. of Cot, aphetic for Jacot.\r\n\r\nNames such as Kitchin, Spence, a north-country word for pantry\r\n(Chapter XX), and Mews, originally applied to the hawk-coops (see\r\nMewer, Chapter XV), point to domestic employment.  The simple Mew,\r\ncommon in Hampshire, is a bird nickname.  Scammell preserves an older\r\nform of shamble(s), originally the benches on which meat was exposed\r\nfor sale.  The name Currie, or Curry, is too common to be referred\r\nentirely to the Scot.  Corrie, a mountain glen, or to Curry in\r\nSomerset, and I conjecture that it sometimes represents Old French and\r\nMid. Eng. curie, a kitchen, which is the origin of Petty Cury in\r\nCambridge and of the famous French name Curie.  Nor can Furness be\r\nderived exclusively from the Furness district of Lancashire.  It must\r\nsometimes correspond to the common French name Dufour, from four,\r\noven.  We also have the name Ovens.  Stables, when not identical with\r\nStaples (Chapter XIII), belongs to the same class as Mews.  Chambers,\r\nfound in Scotland as Chalmers, is official, the medieval de la Chambre\r\noften referring to the Exchequer Chamber of the City of London.\r\nBellchambers has probably no connection with this word.  It appears to\r\nbe an imitative spelling of Belencombre, a place near Dieppe, for the\r\nentry de Belencumbre is of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nPlaces of confinement are represented by Gale, gaol (Chapter III),\r\nPenn, whence Inkpen (Berkshire), Pond, Pound, and Penfold or Pinfold.\r\nBut Gales is also for Anglo-Fr. Galles, Wales.  Butts may come from\r\nthe archery ground, while Butt is generally to be referred to the\r\nFrench name Bout (Chapter VII) or to Budd (Chapter VII).  Cordery, for\r\nde la corderie, of the rope-walk, has been confused with the much more\r\npicturesque Corderoy, i.e. coeur de roi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOP SIGNS\r\n\r\nAs is well known, medieval shops had signs instead of numbers, and\r\ntraces of this custom are still to be seen in country towns.  It is\r\nquite obvious that town surnames would readily spring into existence\r\nfrom such signs.  The famous name Rothschild, always mispronounced in\r\nEnglish, goes back to the \"red shield\" over Nathan Rothschild's shop\r\nin the Jewry of Frankfurt; and within the writer's memory two brothers\r\nnamed Grainge in the little town of Uxbridge were familiarly known as\r\nBible Grainge and Gridiron Grainge.  Many animal surnames are to be\r\nreferred partly to this source, e.g. Bull, Hart, Lamb, Lyon, Ram,\r\nRoebuck, Stagg; Cock, Falcon, Peacock, Raven, Swann, etc., all still\r\ncommon as tavern signs.  The popinjay, or parrot, is still\r\noccasionally found as Pobgee, Popjoy.  These surnames all have, of\r\ncourse, an alternative explanation (ch.  xxiii.).  Here also usually\r\nbelong Angel and Virgin.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of such names probably consist of those taken\r\nfrom figures used in heraldry or from objects which indicated the\r\ncraft practised, or the special commodity in which the tradesman\r\ndealt.  Such are Arrow, Bell, Buckle, Crosskeys, Crowne, Gauntlett,\r\nHatt, Horne, Image, Key, Lilley, Meatyard, measuring wand--\r\n\r\n\"Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight,\r\nor in measure\" (Lev. xix. 35)--\r\n\r\nMullett, [Footnote: A five-pointed star, Old Fr. molette, rowel of a\r\nspur.]  Rose, Shears, and perhaps Blades, Shipp, Spurr, Starr, Sword.\r\nThomas Palle, called \"Sheres,\" died in London, 1376.\r\n\r\nBut here again we must walk delicately.  The Germanic name Hatto,\r\nborne by the wicked bishop who perished in the Mäuseturm, gave the\r\nFrench name Hatt with the accusative form Hatton, [Footnote: In Old\r\nFrench a certain number of names, mostly of Germanic origin, had an\r\naccusative in -on, e.g. Guy, Guyon, Hugues, Hugon.  From Lat. Pontius\r\ncame Poinz, Poinson, whence our Poyntz, less pleasingly Punch, and\r\nPunshon.  In the Pipe Rolls these are also spelt Pin-, whence Pinch,\r\nPinchin, and Pinches.] Horn is an old personal name, as in the\r\nmedieval romance of King Horn, Shipp is a common provincialism for\r\nsheep, [Footnote: Hence the connection between the ship and the\r\n\"ha'porth of tar.\"]  Starr has another explanation (see Starling) and\r\nBell has several (chapter 1).  I should guess that Porteous was the\r\nsign used by some medieval writer of mass-books and breviaries.  Its\r\noldest form is the Anglo-Fr. Porte-hors, corresponding to medieval\r\nLat. portiforium, a breviary, lit.  what one carries outside, a\r\nportable prayer-book--\r\n\r\n\"For on my porthors here I make an oath.\" (B, 1321.)\r\n\r\nBut as the name is found without prefix in the Hundred Rolls, it may\r\nhave been a nickname conferred on some clericus who was proud of so\r\nrare a possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. NORMAN BLOOD\r\n\r\n\"Such, however, is the illusion of antiquity and wealth that decent\r\nand dignified men now existing boast their descent from these filthy\r\nthieves\"\r\n\r\n(EMERSON, English Traits, ch. iv.).\r\n\r\nNot every Norman or Old French name need be included in the group\r\ndescribed by Emerson when talking down to an uneducated audience.  In\r\nfact, it is probable that the majority of genuine French names belong\r\nto a later period; for, although the baron who accompanied the\r\nConqueror would in many cases keep his old territorial designation,\r\nthe minor ruffian would, as a rule, drop the name of the obscure\r\nhamlet from which he came and assume some surname more convenient in\r\nhis new surroundings.  Local names of Old French origin are usually\r\ntaken from the provinces and larger towns which had a meaning for\r\nEnglish ears.  I have given examples of such in chapter xi.  Of course\r\nit is easy to take a detailed map of Northern France and say, without\r\noffering any proof, that \"Avery (Chapter VIII) is from Evreux, Belcher\r\n(Chapter XXI) from Bellecourt, Custance (Chapter X) from Coutances,\"\r\nand so on.  But any serious student knows this to be idiotic nonsense.\r\nThe fact that, except in the small minority composed of the senior\r\nbranches of the noblest houses, the surname was not hereditary till\r\ncenturies after the Conquest, justifies any bearer of a Norman name\r\ntaken from a village or smaller locality in repudiating all connection\r\nwith the \"filthy thieves\" and conjecturing descent from some decent\r\nartisan belonging to one of the later immigrations.\r\n\r\nThat a considerable number of aristocratic families, and others, bear\r\nan easily recognizable French town or village name is of course well\r\nknown, but it will usually be found that such names are derived from\r\nplaces which are as plentiful in France as our own Ashleys, Barton,\r\nBurton, Langleys, Newtons, Suttons, etc., are in England.  In some\r\ncases a local French name has spread in an exceptional manner.\r\nExamples are Baines (Gains, 2 [Footnote: The figures in brackets\r\nindicate the number of times that the French local name occurs in the\r\nPostal Directory.  The above is the usual explanation of Baines.\r\nfound with de in the Hundred Rolls.  But I think it was sometimes a\r\nnickname, bones, applied to a thin man.  I find William Banes in\r\nLancashire in 1252; cf. Langbain.] ), Gurney (Gournai, 6), Vernon (3).\r\nBut usually in such cases we find a large number of spots which may\r\nhave given rise to the surname, e.g. Beaumont (46, without counting\r\nBelmont), Dampier (Dampierre, i.e. St. Peter's, 28), Daubeney, Dabney\r\n(Aubigné, 4, Aubigny, 17), Ferrers (Ferriéres, 22), Nevill (Neuville,\r\n58), Nugent (Nogent, 17), Villiers (58).  This last name, representing\r\nVulgar Lat. villarium, is the origin of Ger. -weiler, so common in\r\nGerman village names along the old Roman roads, e.g. Badenweiler,\r\nFroschweiler, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to those surnames of this class which have remained\r\nsomewhat more exclusive, we generally find that the place-name is also\r\ncomparatively rare.  Thus Hawtrey is from Hauterive (7), Pinpoint from\r\nPierrepont (5), Furneaux from Fourneaux (5), Vipont and Vipan from\r\nVieux-Pont (3), and there are three places called Percy.\r\n\r\nThe following have two possible birthplaces each-Bellew or Pellew\r\n(Belleau), Cantelo (Canteloup [Footnote: But the doublet Chanteloup is\r\ncommon.]), Mauleverer (Maulévrier), Mompesson (Mont Pinçon or\r\nPinchon), Montmorency, Mortimer (Morte-mer).  The following are\r\nunique--Carteret, Doll [Footnote: This may also be a metronymic, from\r\nDorothy.]  (Dol), Fiennes, Furnival (Fournival), Greville, Harcourt,\r\nMelville (Meleville), Montresor, Mowbray (Monbrai), Sackville\r\n(Sacquenville), Venables.  These names are taken at random, but the\r\nsame line of investigation can be followed up by any reader who thinks\r\nit worth while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRUPT FORMS\r\n\r\nApart from aristocratic questions, it is interesting to notice the\r\ncontamination which has occurred between English and French surnames\r\nof local origin.  The very common French suffix -ville is regularly\r\nconfounded with our -field.  Thus Summerfield is the same name as\r\nSomerville, Dangerfield is for d'Angerville, Belfield for Belleville,\r\nBlomfield for Blonville, and Stutfield for Estouteville, while\r\nGrenville, Granvillehave certainly become confused with our Grenfell,\r\ngreen fell, and Greenfield.  Camden notes that Turberville became\r\nTroublefield, and I have found the intermediate Trubleville in the\r\ntwelfth century.  The case of Tess Durbeyfield will occur to every\r\nreader.  The suffix -fort has been confused with our -ford and -forth,\r\nso that Rochford is in some cases for Rochefort and Beeforth for\r\nBeaufort or Belfort.  With the first syllable of Beeforth we may\r\ncompare Beevor for Beauvoir, Belvoir, Beecham  for Beauchamp, and\r\nBeamish for Beaumais.\r\n\r\nThe name Beamish actually occurs as that of village in Durham, the\r\nearlier form of which points Old French origin, from beau mes, Lat.\r\nbellum mansum, a fair manse, i.e. dwelling.  Otherwise it would be\r\ntempting to derive the surname Beamish from Ger, böhmisch, earlier\r\nbehmisch, Bohemian.\r\n\r\nA brief survey of French spot-names which have passed into English\r\nwill show that they were acquired in exactly the same way as the\r\ncorresponding English names.  Norman ancestry, is, however, not always\r\nto be assumed in this case.  Until the end of the fourteenth century a\r\nlarge proportion of our population was bi-lingual, and names\r\naccidentally recorded in Anglo-French may occasionally have stuck.\r\nThus the name Boyes or Boyce may spring from a man of pure English\r\ndescent who happened to be described as del boil instead of atte wood,\r\njust as Capron (Chapter XXI) means Hood.  While English spot-names\r\nhave as a rule shed both the preposition and the article (Chapter\r\nXII), French usually keeps one or both, though these were more often\r\nlost when the name passed into England.  Thus our Roach is not a\r\nfish-name, but corresponds to Fr. Laroche or Delaroche; and the blind\r\npirate Pew, if not a Welshman, ap Hugh, was of the race of Dupuy, from\r\nOld Fr. Puy, a hill, Lat. podium, a height, gallery, etc., whence also\r\nour Pew, once a raised platform.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the prefix has passed into English; e.g. Diprose is from\r\ndes préaux, of the meadows, a name assumed by Boileau among others.\r\nThere are, of course, plenty of places in France called Les Préaux,\r\nbut in the case of such a name we need not go further than possession\r\nof, or residence by, a piece of grass-land--\r\n\r\n\"Je sais un paysan qu'on appelait Gros-Pierre,\r\n Qui, n'ayant pour tout bien qu'un seul quartier de terre,\r\n Y fit tout alentour faire un fossé bourbeux,\r\n Et de monsieur de l'Isle en prit le nom pompeux.\"\r\n\r\n(Molière L'Ecole des Femmes, i. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe Old French singular préal is perhaps the origin of Prall, Prawle.\r\nSimilarly Preece, Prees, usually for Price, may sometimes be for des\r\nPres.  With Boyes (Chapter XIV) we may compare Tallis from Fr.\r\ntaillis, a copse (tailler, to cut).  Garrick, a Huguenot name, is Fr,\r\ngangue, an old word for heath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE NAMES\r\n\r\nTrees have in all countries a strong influence on topographical names,\r\nand hence on surnames.  Frean, though usually from the Scandinavian\r\nname Fraena, is sometimes for Fr. frêne, ash, Lat. fraxinus, while\r\nCain and Kaines [Footnote: There is one family of Keynes derived\r\nspecifically from Chahaignes (Sarthe).]  are Norm.  quêne (chêne),\r\noak.  The modern French for beech is hêtre, Du. heester, but Lat.\r\nfagus has given a great many dialect forms which have supplied us with\r\nthe surnames Fay, Foy, and the plural dim. Failes.  Here also I should\r\nput the name Defoe, assumed by the writer whose father was satisfied\r\nwith Foe.  With Quatrefages, four beeches, we may compare such English\r\nnames as Fiveash, Twelvetrees, and Snooks, for \"seven oaks.\"\r\n\r\nIn Latin the suffix -etum was used to designate a grove or plantation.\r\nThis suffix, or its plural -eta, is very common in France, becoming\r\nsuccessively -ei(e), -oi(e), -ai(e).  The name Dobree is a Guernsey\r\nspelling of d'Aubray, Lat. arboretum, which was dissimilated (Chapter\r\nIII) into arboretum.  Darblay, the name of Fanny Burney's husband, is\r\na variant.  From au(l)ne, alder, we have aunai, whence our Dawnay.  So\r\nalso frênai has given Freeney, chênai, Chaney, and the Norm.  quênai\r\nis one origin of Kenney, while the older chesnai appears in Chesney.\r\nHoussaie, from hoax, holly, gives Hussey; chastenai, chestnut grove,\r\nexists in Nottingham as Chastener; coudrai, hazel copse, gives Cowdrey\r\nand Cowdery; Verney and Varney are from vernai, grove of alders, of\r\nCeltic origin, and Viney corresponds to the French name Vinoy, Lat.\r\nvinetum.\r\n\r\nWe have also Chinnery, Chenerey from the extended chênerai, and\r\nPomeroy from pommerai.  Here again the name offers no clue as to the\r\nexact place of origin.  There are in the French Postal Directory eight\r\nplaces called Épinay, from épine, thorn, but these do not exhaust the\r\nnumber of \"spinnies\" in France.  Also connected with tree-names are\r\nConyers, Old Fr, coigniers, quince-trees, and Pirie, Perry, Anglo-Fr.\r\npérie, a collective from peire (poire).\r\n\r\nAmong Norman names for a homestead the favourite is mesnil, from\r\nVulgar Lat. mansionile, which enters into a great number of local\r\nnames.  It has given our Meynell, and is also the first element of\r\nMainwaring, Mannering, from mesnil-Warin.  The simple mes, a southern\r\nform of which appears in Dumas, has given us Mees and Meese, which are\r\nthus etymological doublets of the word manse.  With Beamish (Chapter\r\nXIV) we may compare Bellasis, from bel-assis, fairly situated.  Poyntz\r\nis sometimes for des ponts; cf. Pierpoint for Pierrepont.\r\n\r\nEven Norman names which were undoubtedly borne by leaders among the\r\nConqueror's companions are now rarely found among the noble, and many\r\na descendant of these once mighty families cobbles the shoes of more\r\nrecent invaders.  Even so the descendants of the Spanish nobles who\r\nconquered California are glad to peddle vegetables at the doors of San\r\nFrancisco magnates whose fathers dealt in old clothes in some German\r\nJudengasse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. OF OCCUPATIVE NAMES\r\n\r\n\"When Adam delved and Eve span,\r\n Who was then the gentleman?\"\r\n\r\nChant of Wat Tyler's followers.\r\n\r\nThe occupative name would, especially in villages, tend to become a\r\nvery natural surname.  It is not therefore surprising to find so large\r\na number of this class among our commonest surnames, e.g. Smith,\r\nTaylor, Wright, Walker, Turner, Clark, Cooper, etc.  And, as the same\r\ncraft often persisted in a family for generations, it was probably\r\nthis type of surname which first became hereditary.  On the other\r\nhand, such names as Cook, Gardiner, Carter, etc., have no doubt in\r\nsome cases prevailed over another surname lawfully acquired (Chapter\r\nI).  It is impossible to fix an approximate date for the definite\r\nadoption of surnames of this class.  It occurred earlier in towns than\r\nin the country, and by the middle of the fourteenth century we often\r\nfind in the names of London citizens a contradiction between the\r\nsurname and the trade-name; e.g. Walter Ussher, tanner, John Botoner,\r\ngirdler, Roger Carpenter, pepperer, Richard le Hunte, chaundeler,\r\noccur 1336-52.\r\n\r\nThe number of surnames belonging to this group is immense, for every\r\nmedieval trade and craft was highly specialized and its privileges\r\nwere jealously guarded.  The general public, which now, like Issachar,\r\ncrouches between the trusts and the trades unions, was in the middle\r\nages similarly victimized by the guilds of merchants and craftsmen.\r\n\r\nThen, as now, it grumblingly recognized that, \"Plus ça change, plus ça\r\nreste la même chose,\" and went on enduring.  [Footnote: If a student\r\nof philology were allowed to touch on such high matters as\r\nlegislation, I would moralize on the word kiddle, meaning an illegal\r\nkind of weir used for fish-poaching, whence perhaps the surname\r\nKiddell.  From investigations made with a view to discovering the\r\norigin of the word, I came to the conclusion that all the legislative\r\npowers in England spent three centuries in passing enactments against\r\nthese devices, with the inevitable consequence that they became ever\r\nmore numerous.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL GRADES\r\n\r\nBy dealing with a few essential points at the outset we shall clear\r\nthe ground for considering the various groups of surnames connected\r\nwith trade, craft, profession or office.  To begin with, it is certain\r\nthat such names as Pope, Cayzer, King, Earl, Bishop are nicknames,\r\nvery often conferred on performers in religious plays or acquired in\r\nconnection with popular festivals and processions--\r\n\r\n\"Names also have been taken of civil honours, dignities and estate, as\r\nKing, Duke, Prince, Lord, Baron, Knight, Valvasor or Vavasor, Squire,\r\nCastellon, partly for that their ancestours were such, served such,\r\nacted such parts; or were Kings of the Bean, Christmas-Lords, etc.\"\r\n(Camden).\r\n\r\nWe find corresponding names in other languages, and some of the French\r\nnames, usually preceded by the definite article, have passed into\r\nEnglish, e.g. Lempriere, a Huguenot name, and Levêque, whence our\r\nLevick, Vick, Veck (Chapter III).  Baron generally appears as Barron,\r\nand Duke, used in Mid. English of any leader, is often degraded to\r\nDuck, whence the dim. Duckett.  But all three of these names can also\r\nbe referred to Marmaduke.\r\n\r\nIt would be tempting to put Palsgrave in this class.  Prince Rupert,\r\nthe Pfalzgraf, i.e. Count Palatine, was known as the Palsgrave in his\r\nday, but I have not found the title recorded early enough.\r\n\r\nWith Lord we must put the northern Laird, and, in my opinion, Senior;\r\nfor, if we notice how much commoner Young is than Old, and Fr. Lejeune\r\nthan Levieux, we must conclude that junior, a very rare surname, ought\r\nto be of much more frequent occurrence than Senior, Synyer, a fairly\r\ncommon name.  There can be little doubt that Senior is usually a\r\nlatinization of the medieval le seigneur, whence also Saynor.  Knight\r\nis not always knightly, for Anglo-Sax. cniht means servant; cf. Ger.\r\nKnecht.  The word got on in the world, with the consequence that the\r\nname is very popular, while its medieval compeers, knave, varlet,\r\nvillain, have, even when adorned with the adj.  good, dropped out of\r\nthe surname list, Bonvalet, Bonvarlet, Bonvillain are still common\r\nsurnames in France.  From Knight we have the compound Road-night, a\r\nmounted servitor.  Thus Knight is more often a true occupative name,\r\nand the same applies to Dring or Dreng, a Scandinavian name of similar\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nOther names from the middle rungs of the social ladder are also to be\r\ntaken literally, e.g. Franklin, a freeholder, Anglo-Fr. frankelein--\r\n\r\n\"How called you your franklin, Prior Aylmer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cedric,\" answered the Prior, \"Cedric the Saxon\"\r\n\r\n(Ivanhoe, ch. i.)--\r\n\r\nBurgess, Freeman, Freeborn.  The latter is sometimes for Freebairn and\r\nexists already as the Anglo-Saxon personal name Freobeorn.  Denison\r\n(Chapter II) is occasionally an accommodated form of denizen,\r\nAnglo-Fr. deinzein, a burgess enjoying the privileges belonging to\r\nthose who lived \"deinz (in) la cité.\" In 1483 a certain Edward\r\nJhonson--\r\n\r\n\"Sued to be mayde Denison for fer of ye payment of ye subsedy.\"\r\n\r\n(Letter to Sir William Stonor, June 9, 1483.)\r\n\r\nBond is from Anglo-Sax, bonda, which means simply agriculturist.  The\r\nword is of Icelandic origin and related to Boor, another word which\r\nhas deteriorated and is rare as a surname, though the cognate Bauer is\r\ncommon enough in Germany.  Holder is translated by Tennant.  For some\r\nother names applied to the humbler peasantry see Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\nTo return to the social summit, we have Kingson, often confused with\r\nthe local Kingston, and its Anglo-French equivalent Fauntleroy.\r\nFaunt, aphetic for Anglo-Fr. enfaunt, is common in Mid. English.  When\r\nthe mother of Moses had made the ark of bulrushes, or, as Wyclif calls\r\nit, the \"junket of resshen,\" she--\r\n\r\n\"Putte the litil faunt with ynne\"\r\n\r\n(Exodus ii. 3)\r\n\r\nThe Old French accusative (Chapter I) was also used as a genitive, as\r\nin Bourg-le-roi, Bourg-la-rein, corresponding to our Kingsbury and\r\nQueensborough.  We have a genitive also in Flowerdew, found in French\r\nas Flourdieu.  Lower, in his Patronymics Britannica (1860), the first\r\nattempt at a dictionary of English surnames, conjectures Fauntleroy to\r\nbe from an ancient French war-cry Défendez le roi!  for \"in course of\r\ntime, the meaning of the name being forgotten, the de would be\r\ndropped, and the remaining syllables would easily glide into\r\nFauntleroy.\" [Footnote: I have quoted this \"etymology\" because it is\r\ntoo funny to be lost; but a good deal of useful information can be\r\nfound in Lower, especially with regard to the habitat of well-known\r\nnames.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECCLESIASTICAL NAMES\r\n\r\nNames of ecclesiastics must usually be nicknames, because medieval\r\nchurchmen were not entitled to have descendants.  This appears clearly\r\nin such an entry as \"Bishop the crossbowman,\" or \"Johannes Monacus et\r\nuxor ejus Emma,\" living in Kent in the twelfth century.  But these\r\nnames are so numerous that I have put them with the Canterbury\r\nPilgrims (ch.  xvii.).  Three of them may be mentioned here in\r\nconnection with a small group of occupative surnames of puzzling form.\r\nWe have noticed (Chapter XII) that monosyllabic, and some other,\r\nsurnames of local origin frequently take an -s, partly by analogy with\r\nnames like Wills, Watts, etc.  We rarely find this -s in the case of\r\noccupative names, but Parsons, Vicars or Vickers, and Monks are\r\ncommon, and in fact the first two are scarcely found without the -s.\r\nTo these we may add Reeves (Chapter XVII), Grieves (Chapter XIX), and\r\nthe well-known Nottingham name Mellers (Chapter XVII).  The\r\nexplanation seems to be that these names are true genitives, and that\r\nJohn Parsons was John the Parson's man, while John Monks was employed\r\nby the monastery.  This is confirmed by such entries as \"Walter atte\r\nParsons,\" \"John del Parsons,\" \"Allen atte Prestes,\" \"William del\r\nFreres,\" \"Thomas de la Vicars,\" all from the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nAnother exceptional group is that of names formed by adding -son to\r\nthe occupative names, the commonest being perhaps Clarkson, Cookson,\r\nSmithson, and Wrightson.  To this class belongs Grayson, which\r\nBardsley shows to be equivalent to the grieve's son.\r\n\r\nOur occupative names are both English and French, [Footnote: We have\r\nalso a few Latinizations, e.g. Faber (wright), Messer (mower).  This\r\ntype of name is much commoner in Germany, e.g. Avenarius, oat man,\r\nFabricius, smith, Textor, weaver, etc.  Mercator, of map projection\r\nfame, was a Fleming named Kremer, i.e. dealer.]  the two languages\r\nbeing represented by those important tradesmen Baker and Butcher.  The\r\nformer is reinforced by Bollinger, Fr. boulanger, Pester, Old Fr.\r\npestour (Lat. piston), and Furner--\r\n\r\n\"Fournier, a baker, or one that keeps, or governs a common oven\"\r\n(Cotgrave).\r\n\r\nThe English and French names for the same trade also survive in\r\nCheeseman and Firminger, Old Fr. formagier (fromage).\r\n\r\nWe have as endings -er, -ier, the latter often made into -yer, -ger,\r\nas in Lockyer, Sawyer, Kidger (Chapter XIX), Woodger, [Footnote:\r\nWoodyer, Woodger, may also be for wood-hewer.  See Stanier] and -or,\r\n-our, as in Taylor, Jenoure (Chapter III).  The latter ending,\r\ncorresponding to Modern Fr. -eur, represents Lat. -or, -orem, but we\r\ntack it onto English words as in \"sailor,\" or substitute it for -er,\r\n-ier, as in Fermor, for Farmer, Fr. fermier.  In the Privy Purse\r\nExpenses of that careful monarch Henry VII. occurs the item--\r\n\r\n\"To bere drunken at a fermors house . . .  1s.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same way we replace the Fr. -our, -eur by -er, as in Turner,\r\nFr. tourneur, Ginner, Jenner for Jenoure.\r\n\r\nThe ending -er, -ier represents the Lat. -arius.  It passed not only\r\ninto French, but also into the Germanic languages, replacing the\r\nTeutonic agential suffix which consisted of a single vowel.  We have a\r\nfew traces of this oldest group of occupative names, e.g. Webb, Mid.\r\nEng. webbe, Anglo-Sax. webb-a, and Hunt, Mid. Eng. hunte, Anglo-Sax.\r\nhunt-a--\r\n\r\n\"With hunte and horne and houndes hym bisyde\"\r\n\r\n(A, 1678)--\r\n\r\nwhich still hold the field easily against Webber and Hunter.\r\n\r\nSo also, the German name Beck represents Old High Ger. pecch-o, baker.\r\nTo these must be added Kemp, a champion, a very early loan-word\r\nconnected with Lat. campus, field, and Wright, originally the worker,\r\nAnglo-Sax. wyrht-a.  Camp is sometimes for Kemp, but is also from the\r\nPicard form of Fr, champ, i.e. Field.  Of similar formation to Webb,\r\netc., is Clapp, from an Anglo-Sax. nickname, the clapper--\r\n\r\n\"Osgod Clapa, King Edward Confessor's staller, was cast upon the\r\npavement of the Church by a demon's hand for his insolent pride in\r\npresence of the relics (of St. Edmund, King and Martyr).\"\r\n\r\n(W. H. Hutton, Bampton Lectures, 1903.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES IN -STER\r\n\r\nThe ending -ster was originally feminine, and applied to trades\r\nchiefly carried on by women, e.g. Baxter, Bagster, baker, Brewster,\r\nSimister, sempster, Webster, etc., but in process of time the\r\ndistinction was lost, so that we find Blaxter and Whitster for\r\nBlacker, Blakey, and Whiter, both of which, curiously enough, have the\r\nsame meaning--\r\n\r\n\"Bleykester or whytster, candidarius\" (Prompt.  Parv.)--\r\n\r\nfor this black represents Mid. Eng. bla-c, related to bleak and\r\nbleach, and meaning pale--\r\n\r\n\"Blake, wan of colour, blesme (blême)\" (Palsgrave).\r\n\r\nOccupative names of French origin are apt to vary according to the\r\nperiod and dialect of their adoption.  For Butcher we find also\r\nBooker, Bowker, and sometimes the later Bosher, Busher, with the same\r\nsound for the ch as in Labouchère, the lady butcher.  But Booker may\r\nalso mean what it appears to mean, as Mid. Eng. bokere is used by\r\nWyclif for the Latin scriba.\r\n\r\nButcher, originally a dealer in goat's flesh, Fr. bouc, has ousted\r\nflesher.  German still has half a dozen surnames derived from names\r\nfor this trade, e.g. Fleischer, Fleischmann, [Footnote: Hellenized as\r\nSarkander.  This was a favourite trick of German scholars at the\r\nRenaissance period.  Well-known examples are Melancthon (Schwarzerd),\r\nNeander (Neumann).]  Metzger, Schlechter; but our flesher has been\r\nabsorbed by Fletcher, a maker of arrows, Fr. flêche.  Fletcher Gate at\r\nNottingham was formerly Flesher Gate.  The undue extension of Taylor\r\nhas already been mentioned (Chapter IV).  Another example is Barker,\r\nwhich has swallowed up the Anglo-Fr. berquier, a shepherd, Fr. berger,\r\nwith the result that the Barkers outnumber the Tanners by three to one\r\n\r\n\"'What craftsman are you?' said our King,\r\n'I pray you, tell me now.'\r\n'I am a barker,' quoth the tanner;\r\n'What craftsman art thou?'\"\r\n\r\n(Edward IV. and the Tanner of Tamworth.)\r\n\r\nThe name seems to have been applied also to the man who barked trees\r\nfor the tanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSING TRADESMEN\r\n\r\nWith Barker it seems natural to mention Mewer, of which I find one\r\nrepresentative in the London Directory.  The medieval le muur had\r\ncharge of the mews in which the hawks were kept while moulting (Fr.\r\nmuer, Lat. mutare).  Hence the phrase \"mewed up.\" The word seems to\r\nhave been used for any kind of coop.  Chaucer tells us of the\r\nFranklin--\r\n\r\n\"Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in muw\" (A, 349).\r\n\r\nI suspect that some of the Muirs (Chapter XII) spring from this\r\nimportant office.  Similarly Clayer has been absorbed by the local\r\nClare, Kayer, the man who made keys, by Care, and Blower, whether of\r\nhorn or bellows, has paid tribute to the local Bloor, Blore.\r\n\r\nSewer, an attendant at table, aphetic for Old Fr. asseour, a setter,\r\nis now a very rare name.  As we know that sewer, a drain, became\r\nshore, it is probable that the surname Shore sometimes represents this\r\nofficial or servile title.  And this same name Shore, though not\r\nparticularly common, and susceptible of a simple local origin, labours\r\nunder grave suspicion of having also enriched itself at the expense of\r\nthe medieval le suur, the shoemaker, Lat. sutor-em, whence Fr.\r\nLesueur.  This would inevitably become Sewer and then Shore, as above.\r\nPerhaps, in the final reckoning, Shaw is not altogether guiltless, for\r\nI know of one family in which this has replaced earlier Shore.\r\n\r\nThe medieval le suur brings us to another problem, viz. the poor show\r\nmade by the craftsmen who clothed the upper and lower extremities of\r\nour ancestors.  The name Hatter, once frequent enough, is almost\r\nextinct, and Capper is not very common.  The name Shoemaker has met\r\nwith the same fate, though the trade is represented by the Lat. Sutor,\r\nwhence Scot.  Souter.  Here belong also Cordner, Codner, [Footnote:\r\nConfused, of course, with the local Codnor (Derbyshire)]  Old Fr.\r\ncordouanier (cordonnier), a cordwainer, a worker in Cordovan leather,\r\nand Corser, Cosser, earlier corviser, corresponding to the French name\r\nCourvoisier, also derived from Cordova.  Chaucer, in describing the\r\nequipment of Sir Thopas, mentions\r\n\r\n\"His shoon of cordewane\" (B, 1922).\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of Groser, grocer, is not surprising, for the word,\r\naphetic for engrosser, originally meaning a wholesale dealer, one who\r\nsold en gros, is of comparatively late occurrence.  His medieval\r\nrepresentative was Spicer.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many occupative titles which are now obsolete, or\r\npractically so, still survive strongly as surnames.  Examples of these\r\nwill be found in chapters xvii.-xx.\r\n\r\nSome occupative names are rather deceptive.  Kisser, which is said\r\nstill to exist, means a maker of cuishes, thigh-armour, Fr, cuisses--\r\n\r\n\"Helm, cuish, and breastplate streamed with gore.\"\r\n\r\n(Lord of the Isles, iv. 33.)\r\n\r\nCorker is for caulker, i.e. one who stopped the chinks of ships and\r\ncasks, originally with lime (Lat. calx)--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulk'd and bitumed ready\"\r\n(Pericles iii.  1).\r\n\r\nCleaver represents Old Fr, clavier, a mace-bearer, Lat. clava, a club,\r\nor a door-keeper, Lat. clavis, a key.  Perhaps even clavus, a nail,\r\nmust also be considered, for a Latin vocabulary of the fifteenth\r\ncentury tells us--\r\n\r\n\"Claves, -vos vet -vas qui fert sit claviger.\"\r\n\r\nNeither Bowler nor Scorer are connected with cricket.  The former made\r\nwooden bowls, and the latter was sometimes a scourer, or scout, Mid.\r\nEng. scurrour, a word of rather complicated origin, but perhaps more\r\nfrequently a peaceful scullion, from Fr. écurer, to scour, Lat.\r\nex-curare--\r\n\r\n\"Escureur, a scourer, cleanser, feyer\" (Cotgrave).\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Feyer: A sweeper, now perhaps represented by Fayer.]\r\n\r\nA Leaper did not always leap (Chapter XVII).  The verb had also in\r\nMid. English the sense of running away, so that the name may mean\r\nfugitive.  In some cases it may represent a maker of leaps, i.e. fish\r\nbaskets, or perhaps a man who hawked fish in such a basket.\r\n\r\nA Slayer made slays, part of a weaver's loom, and a Bloomer worked in\r\na bloom-smithy, from Anglo-Sax. blo-ma, a mass of hammered iron.\r\nWeightman and Warman represent Mid. Eng, waþeman, hunter; cf. the\r\ncommon German surname Weidemann, of cognate origin.  Reader and Booker\r\nare not always literary.  The former is for Reeder, a thatcher--\r\n\r\n\"Redare of howsys, calamator, arundinarius\" (Prompt.  Parv.)--\r\n\r\nand the latter is a Norman variant of Butcher, as already mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPELLING OF TRADE-NAMES\r\n\r\nThe spelling of occupative surnames often differs from that now\r\nassociated with the trade itself.  In Naylor, Taylor, and Tyler we\r\nhave the archaic preference for y.  [Footnote: It may be noted here\r\nthat John Tiler of Dartford, who killed a tax-gatherer for insulting\r\nhis daughter, was not Wat Tiler, who was killed at Smithfield for\r\ninsulting the King.  The confusion between the two has led to much\r\nsympathy being wasted on a ruffian.]  Our ancestors thought sope as\r\ngood a spelling as soap, hence the name Soper.  A Plummer, i.e. a man\r\nwho worked in lead, Lat. plumbum, is now written, by etymological\r\nreaction, plumber, though the restored letter is not sounded.  A man\r\nwho dealt in 'arbs originated the name Arber, which we should now\r\nreplace by herbalist.  We have a restored spelling in clerk, though\r\neducated people pronounce the word as it was once written\r\n\r\n\"Clarke, or he that readeth distinctly, clericus.\" (Holyoak's Lat.\r\nDict., 1612.)\r\n\r\nIn many cases we are unable to say exactly what is the ocpupation\r\nindicated.  We may assume that a Setter and a Tipper did setting and\r\ntipping, and both are said to have been concerned in the arrow\r\nindustry.  If this is true, I should say that Setter might represent\r\nthe Old Fr, saieteur, arrow-maker, from saiete, an arrow, Lat.\r\nsagitta.  But in a medieval vocabulary we find \"setter of mes,\r\ndapifer,\" which would make it the same as Sewer (Chapter XV).\r\nSimilarly, when we consider the number of objects that can be tipped,\r\nwe shall be shy of defining the activity of the Tipper too closely.\r\nTrinder, earlier trenden, is from Mid. Eng. trender, to roll (cf.\r\nRoller).  In the west country trinder now means specifically a\r\nwool-winder--\r\n\r\n\"Lat hym rollen and trenden withynne hymself the lyght of his ynwarde\r\nsighte\" (Boece, 1043).\r\n\r\nThere are also some names of this class to which we can with certainty\r\nattribute two or more origins.  Boulter means a maker of bolts for\r\ncrossbows, [Footnote: How many people who use the expression \"bolt\r\nupright,\" associate it with \"straight as a dart\"?]  but also a sifter,\r\nfrom the obsolete verb to bolt--\r\n\r\n\"The fanned snow, that's bolted\r\n By the northern blasts twice o'er.\"\r\n\r\n(Winter's Tale, iv. 3.)\r\n\r\nCorner means horn-blower, Fr, cor, horn, and is also a contraction of\r\ncoroner, but its commonest origin is local, in angulo, in the corner.\r\nCurren and Curryer are generally connected with leather, but Henry\r\nVII. bestowed £3 on the Curren that brought tidings of Perkin\r\nWar-beck.  Garner has five possible origins: (i) a contraction of\r\ngardener, (ii) from the French personal name Garner, Ger. Werner,\r\n(iii) Old Fr. grenier, grain-keeper, (iv) Old Fr, garennier, warren\r\nkeeper, (v) local, from garner, Fr. grenier, Lat. granarium.  In the\r\nnext chapter will be found, as a specimen problem, an investigation of\r\nthe name Rutter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHONETIC CHANGES\r\n\r\nTwo phonetic phenomena should also be noticed.  One is the regular\r\ninsertion of n before the ending -ger, as in Firminger (Chapter XV),\r\nMassinger (Chapter XX), Pottinger (Chapter XVIII), and in Arminger,\r\nClavinger, from the latinized armiger, esquire, and claviger,\r\nmace-bearer, etc.  (Chapter XV).  The other is the fact that many\r\noccupative names ending in -rer lose the -er by dissimilation (Chapter\r\nIII).  Examples are Armour for armourer, Barter for barterer, Buckler\r\nfor bucklerer, but also for buckle-maker, Callender for calenderer,\r\none who calendered, i.e. pressed, cloth\r\n\r\n\"And my good friend the Callender\r\n Will lend his horse to go.\"\r\n\r\n(John Gilpin, 1.  22)--\r\n\r\nCoffer, for cofferer, a treasurer, Cover, for coverer, i.e. tiler, Fr.\r\ncouvreur, when it does not correspond to Fr. cuvier, i.e. a maker of\r\ncoves, vats, Ginger, Grammer, for grammarer, Paternoster, maker of\r\npaternosters or rosaries, Pepper, Sellar, for cellarer (Chapter III),\r\nTabor, for Taberer, player on the taber.  Here also belongs Treasure,\r\nfor treasurer.  Salter is sometimes for sautrier, a player on the\r\npsaltery.  We have the opposite process in poulterer for Pointer\r\n(Chapter II), and caterer for Cator (Chapter III).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES FROM WARES\r\n\r\nSuch names as Ginger, Pepper, may however belong to the class of\r\nnicknames conferred on dealers in certain commodities; cf. Pescod,\r\nPeskett, from pease-cod.  Of this we have several examples which can\r\nbe confirmed by foreign parallels, e.g. Garlick, found in German as\r\nKnoblauch, [Footnote: The cognate Eng. Clove-leek occurs as a surname\r\nin the Ramsey Chartulary.]  Straw, represented in German by the\r\ncognate name Stroh, and Pease, which is certified by Fr. Despois.  We\r\nfind Witepease in the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nEspecially common are those names which deal with the two staple foods\r\nof the country, bread and beer.  In German we find several compounds\r\nof Brot, bread, and one of the greatest of chess-players bore the\r\namazing name Zuckertort, sugar-tart.  In French we have such names as\r\nPainchaud, Painlevê, Pain-tendre--\r\n\r\n\"Eugene Aram was usher, in 1744, to the Rev. Mr. Painblanc, in\r\nPiccadilly\"\r\n\r\n (Bardsley).\r\n\r\nHence our Cakebread and Whitbread were probably names given to bakers.\r\nSimnel is explained in the same way, and Lambert Simnel is understood\r\nto have been a baker's lad, but the name could equally well be from\r\nFr. Simonel, dim. of Simon.  Wastall is found in the Hundred Rolls as\r\nWasted, Old Fr. gastel (gâteau).  Here also belongs Cracknell--\r\n\r\n\"Craquelin, a cracknell; made of the yolks of egges, water, and\r\nflower; and fashioned like a hollow trendle\" (Cotgrave).\r\n\r\nGoodbeer is explained by Bardsley as a perversion of Godber (Chapter\r\nVII), which may be true, but the name is also to be taken literally.\r\nWe have Ger. Gutbier, and the existence of Sourale in the Hundred\r\nRolls and Sowerbutts at the present day justifies us in accepting both\r\nGoodbeer and Goodale at their face-value.  But Rice is an imitative\r\nform of Welsh Rhys, Reece, and Salt, when not derived from Salt in\r\nStafford, is from Old Fr. sault, a wood, Lat. saltus.  [Footnote: This\r\nis common in place-names, and I should suggest, as a guess, that\r\nSacheverell is from the village of Sault-Chevreuil-du-Tronchet\r\n(Manche).]  It is doubtful whether the name Cheese is to be included\r\nhere.  Jan Kees, for John Cornelius, said to have been a nickname for\r\na Hollander, may easily have reached the Eastern counties.  Bardsley's\r\nearliest instance for the name is John Chese, who was living in\r\nNorfolk in 1273.  But still I find Furmage as a medieval surname.\r\n\r\nWe also have the dealer in meat represented by the classical example\r\nof Hogsflesh, with which we may compare Mutton and Veal, two names\r\nwhich may be seen fairly near each other in Hammersmith Road (but for\r\nthese see also Chapter XXIII), and I have known a German named\r\nKalbfleisch.  Names of this kind would sometimes come into existence\r\nthrough the practice of crying wares; though if Mr. Rottenherring, who\r\nwas a freeman of York in 1332, obtained his in this way, he must have\r\ndeliberately ignored an ancient piece of wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. A SPECIMEN PROBLEM: RUTTER\r\n\r\n\"Howe sayst thou, man?  am not I a joly rutter?\"\r\n\r\n(Skelton, Magnyfycence, 1.  762.)\r\n\r\nThe fairly common name Rutter is a good example of the difficulty of\r\nexplaining a surname derived from a trade or calling no longer\r\npractised.  Even so careful an authority as Bardsley has gone\r\nhopelessly astray over this name.  He says, \"German ritter, a rider,\r\ni.e. a trooper,\" and quotes from Halliwell, \"rutter, a rider, a\r\ntrooper, from the German; a name given to mercenary soldiers engaged\r\nfrom Brabant, etc.\"  Now this statement is altogether opposed to\r\nchronology.  The name occurs as le roter, rotour, ruter in the Hundred\r\nRolls of 1273, i.e. more than two centuries before any German name for\r\ntrooper could possibly have become familiar in England.  Any stray\r\nMid. High Ger. Riter would have been assimilated to the cognate Eng.\r\nRider.  It is possible that some German Reuters have become English\r\nRutters in comparatively modern times, but the German surname Reuter\r\nhas nothing to do with a trooper.  It represents Mid. High Ger.\r\nriutaere, a clearer of land, from the verb riuten (reuten),\r\ncorresponding to Low Ger. roden, and related to our royd, a clearing\r\n(Chapter XII).  This word is apparently not connected with our root,\r\nthough it means to root out, but ultimately belongs to a root ru which\r\nappears in Lat. rutrum, a spade, rutabulum, a rake, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is another Ger. Reuter, a trooper, which has given the\r\nsixteenth-century Eng. rutter, but not as a surname.  The word appears\r\nin German about 1500, i.e. rather late for the surname period, and\r\ncomes from Du. ruiter, a mercenary trooper.  The German for trooper is\r\nReiter, really the same word as Ritter, a knight, the two forms having\r\nbeen differentiated in meaning; cf. Fr. cavalier, a trooper, and\r\nchevalier, a knight.  In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Ger.\r\nReiter was confused with, and supplanted by, this borrowed word\r\nReuter, which was taken to mean rider, and we find the cavalry called\r\nReuterei well into the eighteenth century.  As a matter of fact the\r\ntwo words are quite unrelated, though the origin of Du. ruiter is\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\nThe New English Dictionary gives, from the year 1506, rutter (var.\r\nruter, ruiter), a cavalry soldier, especially German, from Du. ruiter,\r\nwhence Ger. Reuter, as above.  It connects the Dutch word with\r\nmedieval Lat. rutarius, i.e. ruptarius, which is also Kluge's view.\r\n[Footnote: Deutsches Etymologisches Wrterbuch.]  But Franck [Footnote:\r\nEtymologisch Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal.]  sees phonetic\r\ndifficulties and prefers to regard ruiter as belonging rather to\r\nruiten, to uproot.  The application of the name up-rooter to a lawless\r\nmercenary is not unnatural.\r\n\r\nBut whatever be the ultimate origin of this Dutch and German military\r\nword, it is sufficiently obvious that it cannot have given an English\r\nsurname which is already common in the thirteenth century.  There is a\r\nmuch earlier claimant in the field.\r\n\r\nThe New English Dictionary has roter (1297), var. rotour, rotor, and\r\nrouter (1379), a lawless person, robber, ruffian, from Old Fr. rotier\r\n(routier), and also the form rutar, used by Philemon Holland, who, in\r\nhis translation of Camden's Britannia (1610), says \"That age called\r\nforaine and willing souldiours rutars.\"  The reference is to King\r\nJohn's mercenaries, c. 1215.  Fr, routier, a mercenary, is usually\r\nderived from route, a band, Lat. rupta, a piece broken off, a\r\ndetachment.  References to the grander routes, the great mercenary\r\nbands which overran France in the fourteenth century, are common in\r\nFrench history.  But the word was popularly, and naturally, connected\r\nwith route, Lat. (via) rupta, a highway, so that Godefroy [Footnote:\r\nDictionnaire de rancien Français.]  separates routier, a vagabond,\r\nfrom routier, a bandit soldier.  Cotgrave has--\r\n\r\n\"Routier, an old traveller, one that by much trotting up and down is\r\ngrown acquainted with most waies; and hence, an old beaten souldier;\r\none whom a long practise hath made experienced in, or absolute master\r\nof, his profession; and (in evill part) an old crafty fox, notable\r\nbeguiler, ordinary deceiver, subtill knave; also, a purse-taker, or a\r\nrobber by the high way side.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine the relative shares of route, a band,\r\nand route, a highway, in this definition, but there has probably been\r\nnatural confusion between two words, separate in meaning, though\r\netymologically identical.\r\n\r\nNow our thirteenth-century rotors and rulers may represent Old Fr.\r\nroutier, and have been names applied to a mercenary soldier or a\r\nvagabond.  But this cannot be considered certain.  If we consult du\r\nCange, [Footnote: Glossarium ad Scriptures medics et inflows\r\nLatinitatis.]  we find, s.v. rumpere, \"ruptarii, pro ruptuarii, quidam\r\npraedones sub xi saeculum, ex rusticis. . .  collecti ac conflati,\"\r\nwhich suggests connection with \"ruptuarius, colonus qui agrum seu\r\nterram rumpit, proscindit, colic,\" i.e. that the ruptarii, also called\r\nrutarii, rutharii, rotharii, rotarii, etc., were so named because they\r\nwere revolting peasants, i.e. men connected with the roture, or\r\nbreaking of the soil, from which we get roturier, a plebeian.  That\r\nwould still connect our Rutters with Lat. rumpere, but by a third\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nFinally, Old French has one more word which seems to me quite as good\r\na candidate as any of the others, viz. roteur, a player on the rote,\r\ni.e. the fiddle used by the medieval minstrels, Chaucer says of his\r\nFrere--\r\n\r\n\"Wel koude he synge and playen on a rote.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 236.)\r\n\r\nThe word is possibly of Celtic origin (Welsh crwth) and a doublet of\r\nthe archaic crowd, or crowth, a fiddle.  Both rote and crowth are used\r\nby Spenser.  Crowd is perhaps not yet obsolete in dialect, and the\r\nfiddler in Hudibras is called Crowdero.  Thus Rutter may be a doublet\r\nof Crowther.  There may be other possible etymologies for Rutter, but\r\nthose discussed will suffice to show that the origin of occupative\r\nnames is not always easily guessed.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written I have found strong evidence for the\r\n\"fiddler\" derivation of the name.  In 1266 it was decided by a\r\nLancashire jury that Richard le Harper killed William le Roter, or\r\nRuter, in self-defence.  I think there can be little doubt that some,\r\nif not all, of our Rutters owe their names to the profession\r\nrepresented by this enraged musician.  William le Citolur and William\r\nle Piper also appear from the same record (Patent Rolls) to have\r\nindulged in homicide in the course of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. THE CANTERBURY PILGRIMS\r\n\r\n\"In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay,\r\n Redy to wenden on my pilgrymage,\r\n To Caunterbury with ful devout corage,\r\n At nyght were come into that hostelrye\r\n Wel nyne and twenty in a compaignye\r\n Of sondry folk, by aventure y-falle\r\n In felaweshipe, and pilgrimes were they alle,\r\n That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde.\"\r\n\r\n(Prologue, 1.  20.)\r\n\r\nThis famous band of wayfarers includes representatives of all classes,\r\nsave the highest and the lowest, just at the period when our surnames\r\nwere becoming fixed.  It seems natural to distinguish the following\r\ngroups.  The leisured class is represented by the Knight (Chapter XV)\r\nand his son the Squire, also found as Swire or Swyer, Old Fr. escuyer\r\n(écuyer), a shield-bearer (Lat. Scutum), with their attendant Yeoman,\r\na name that originally meant a small landowner and later a trusted\r\nattendant of the warlike kind--\r\n\r\n\"And in his hand he baar a myghty bow\"\r\n\r\n(A, 108.)\r\n\r\nWith these goes the Franklin (Chapter XV), who had been Sherriff, i.e.\r\nshire-reeve.  He is also described as a Vavasour (p. ii)--\r\n\r\n\"Was nowher such a worthy vavasour\" (A, 360.)\r\n\r\nFrom the Church and the professions we have the Nunn, her attendant\r\npriests, whence the names Press, Prest, the Monk, the Frere, or Fryer,\r\n\"a wantowne and a merye,\" the Clark of Oxenforde, the Sargent of the\r\nlawe, the Sumner, i.e. summoner or apparitor, the doctor of physic,\r\ni.e. the Leech or Leach--\r\n\r\n\"Make war breed peace; make peace stint war; make each\r\n Prescribe to other, as each other's leech\"\r\n\r\n(Timon of Athens, v. 4)--\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The same word as the worm leech, from an Anglo-Saxon word\r\nfor healer.]\r\n\r\nand the poor parson.  Le surgien and le fisicien were once common\r\nsurnames, but the former is almost swallowed up by Sargent, and the\r\nlatter seems to have died out.  The name Leach has been reinforced by\r\nthe dialect lache, a bog, whence also the compounds Blackleach,\r\nDepledge.  Loosely attached to the church is the Pardoner, with his\r\nwallet--\r\n\r\n\"Bret-ful of pardon, comen from Rome al hoot.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 687.)\r\n\r\nHis name still survives as Pardner, and perhaps as Partner, though\r\nboth are very rare.\r\n\r\nCommerce is represented by the Marchant, depicted as a character of\r\nweight and dignity, and the humbler trades and crafts by--\r\n\r\n\"An haberdasher, and a Carpenter,\r\n A Webbe, a deyer (Dyer), and a tapiser.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 361.)\r\n\r\nTo these may be added the Wife of Bath, whose comfortable means were\r\ndrawn from the cloth trade, then our staple industry.\r\n\r\nFrom rural surroundings come the Miller and the Plowman, as kindly a\r\nman as the poor parson his brother, for--\r\n\r\n\"He wolde threshe, and therto dyke and delve,\r\n For Cristes sake, for every poure wight,\r\n Withouten hire, if it lay in his myght.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 536.)\r\n\r\nThe Miller is the same as the Meller or Mellor--\r\n\r\n\"Upon the whiche brook ther stant a melle;\r\n And this is verray sooth, that I yow tell.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 3923.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Melle is a Kentish form, used by Chaucer for the rime; cf.\r\npet for pit (Chapter XIII).]\r\n\r\nThe oldest form of the name is Milner, from Anglo-Sax. myln, Lat.\r\nmolina; cf. Kilner from kiln, Lat. culina, kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe official or servile class includes the manciple, or buyer for a\r\nfraternity of templars, otherwise called an achatour, whence Cator,\r\nChaytor, Chater (Chapter III), [Footnote: Chater, Chaytor may be also\r\nfrom escheatour, an official who has given us the word cheat.]  the\r\nReeve, an estate steward, so crafty that--\r\n\r\n\"Ther nas baillif (Chapter IV), ne herde (Chapter III), nor oother\r\n hyne (Chapter III),\r\n That he ne knew his sleights and his covyne\"\r\n\r\n(A, 603);\r\n\r\nand finally the Cook, or Coke (Chapter I)--\r\n\r\n\"To boylle the chicknes and the marybones.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 380.)\r\n\r\nIn a class by himself stands the grimmest figure of all, the Shipman,\r\nof whom we are told\r\n\r\n\"If that he faught, and hadde the hyer hond,\r\n By water he sente hem hoom to every lond.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 399.)\r\n\r\nThe same occupation has given the name Marner, for mariner, and\r\nSeaman, but the medieval forms of the rare name Saylor show that it is\r\nfrom Fr. sailleur, a dancer, an artist who also survives as Hopper and\r\nLeaper--\r\n\r\n\"To one that leped at Chestre, 6s.  8d.\"\r\n\r\n(Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VII,  1495.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote: He was usually more generous to the high arts, e.g. \"To a\r\nSpaynarde that pleyed the fole, £2,\" \"To the young damoysell that\r\ndaunceth, £30.\" With which cf. \"To Carter for writing of a boke, 7s.\r\n4d.\"]\r\n\r\nThe pilgrims were accompanied by the host of the Tabard Inn, whose\r\noccupation has given us the names Inman and Hostler, Oastler, Old Fr.\r\nhostelier (hôtelier), now applied to the inn servant who looks after\r\nthe 'osses.  Another form is the modern-looking Hustler.  Distinct\r\nfrom these is Oster, Fr. oiseleur, a bird-catcher; cf. Fowler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECCLESIASTICAL NAMES\r\n\r\nIf we deal here with ecclesiastical names, as being really nicknames\r\n(Chapter XV), that will leave the trader and craftsman, the peasant,\r\nand the official or servile class to be treated in separate chapters.\r\nSocial, as distinguished from occupative, surnames have already been\r\ntouched on, and the names, not very numerous, connected with warfare\r\nhave also been mentioned in various connections.\r\n\r\nAmong ecclesiastical names Monk has the largest number of variants.\r\nIts Anglo-French form is sometimes represented by Munn and Moon, while\r\nMoney is the oldest Fr. monie; cf. Vicary from Old Fr. vicarie.  But\r\nthe French names La Monnaie, de la Monnaie, are local, from residence\r\nnear the mint.  The canon appears as Cannon, Channen, and Shannon, Fr.\r\nchanoine--\r\n\r\n\"With this chanoun I dwelt have seven yere\"\r\n\r\n(G, 720);\r\n\r\nbut Dean is also local sometimes (Chapter XII) and Deacon is an\r\nimitative form of Dakin or Deakin, from David (Chapter VI).  Charter\r\nwas used of a monk of the Charter-house, a popular corruption of\r\nChartreuse\r\n\r\n\"With a company dyde I mete,\r\n As ermytes, monkes, and freres,\r\n Chanons, chartores . . .\"\r\n\r\n(Cock Lorelles Bote.)\r\n\r\nCharter also comes from archaic Fr. chartier (charretier), a carter,\r\nand perhaps sometimes from Old Fr. chartrier, \"a jaylor; also, a\r\nprisoner\" (Cotg.), which belongs to Lat. carcer, prison.  [Footnote:\r\nThe sense development of these two words is curious.]\r\n\r\nCharters may be from the French town Chartres, but is more likely a\r\nperversion of Charterhouse, as Childers is of the obsolete\r\n\"childer-house,\" orphanage.\r\n\r\nAmong lower orders of the church we have Lister, a reader, [Footnote:\r\nFound in Late Latin as legista, from Lat. Legere, to read.]  Bennet,\r\nan exorcist, and Collet, aphetic for acolyte.  But each of these is\r\nsusceptible of another origin which is generally to be preferred.\r\nChaplin is of course for chaplain, Fr. chapelain.  The legate appears\r\nas Leggatt.  Crosier or Crozier means cross-bearer.  At the funeral of\r\nAnne of Cleves (1557) the mass was executed--\r\n\r\n\"By thabbott in pontificalibus wthis croysyer, deacon and subdeacon.\"\r\n\r\nCanter, Caunter is for chanter, and has an apparent dim. Cantrell,\r\ncorresponding to the French name Chantereau.  The practice, unknown in\r\nEnglish, of forming dims.  from occupative names is very common in\r\nFrench, e.g. from Mercier we have Mercerot, from Berger, i.e.\r\nShepherd, a number of derivatives such as Bergerat, Bergeret,\r\nBergerot, etc.  Sanger and Sangster were not necessarily\r\necclesiastical Singers.  Converse meant a lay-brother employed as a\r\ndrudge in a monastery.  Sacristan, the man in charge of the sacristy,\r\nfrom which we have Secretan, is contracted into Saxton and Sexton, a\r\nname now usually associated with grave-digging and bell-ringing,\r\nthough the latter task once belonged to the Knowler--\r\n\r\n\"Carilloneur, a chymer, or knowler of bells\" (Cotgrave).\r\n\r\nThis is of course connected with \"knell,\" though the only Kneller who\r\nhas become famous was a German named Kniller.\r\n\r\nMarillier, probably a Huguenot name, is an Old French form of\r\nmarguillier, a churchwarden, Lat. matricularius.  The hermit survives\r\nas Armatt, Armitt, with which cf. the Huguenot Lermitte (l'ermite),\r\nand the name of his dwelling is common (Chapter XIII); Anker, now\r\nanchorite, is also extant.  Fals-Semblant says--\r\n\r\n\"Somtyme I am religious,\r\n Now lyk an anker in an hous.\"\r\n\r\n(Romaunt of the Rose, 6348.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPILGRIMS\r\n\r\nWhile a Pilgrim acquired his name by a journey to any shrine, a Palmer\r\nmust originally have been to the Holy Land, and a Romer to Rome.  But\r\nthe frequent occurrence of Palmer suggests that it was often a\r\nnickname for a pious fraud.  We have a doublet of Pilgrim in Pegram,\r\nthough this may come from the name Peregrine, the etymology being the\r\nsame, viz. Lat. peregrines, a foreigner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. TRADES AND CRAFTS\r\n\r\n\"What d'ye lack, noble sir?--What d'ye lack, beauteous madam?\"\r\n\r\n(Fortunes of Nigel, ch. i.)\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages there was no great class of retail dealers distinct\r\nfrom the craftsmen who fashioned objects.  The same man made and sold\r\nin almost every case.  There were of course general dealers, such as\r\nthe French Marchant or his English equivalent the Chapman (Chapter\r\nII), the Dutch form of which has given us the Norfolk name Copeman.\r\nThe Broker is now generally absorbed by the local Brooker.  There were\r\nalso the itinerant merchants, of whom more anon; but in the great\r\nmajority of cases the craftsman made and sold one article, and was, in\r\nfact, strictly forbidden to wander outside his special line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHERY\r\n\r\nFuller tells us that--\r\n\r\n\"England were but a fling,\r\n Save for the crooked stick and the gray-goose-wing,\"\r\n\r\nand the importance of the bow and arrow is shown by the number of\r\nsurnames connected with their manufacture.  We find the Bowyer, Bower\r\nor Bowmaker, who trimmed and shaped the wand of yew, [Footnote: This\r\nis also one source of Boyer, but the very common French surname Boyer\r\nmeans ox-herd.]  the Fletcher (Chapter XV), Arrowsmith, or Flower, who\r\nprepared the arrow--\r\n\r\n\"His bowe he bente and sette therinne a flo\" (H, 264)--\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The true English word for arrow, Anglo-Sax. fla.]\r\n\r\nand the Tipper, Stringer, and Horner, who attended to smaller details,\r\nthough the Tipper and Stringer probably tipped and strung other\r\nthings, and the Horner, though he made the horn nocks of the long-bow,\r\nalso made horn cups and other objects.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which specialization was carried is shown by the trade\r\ndescription of John Darks, longbowstringemaker, who died in 1600.  The\r\nArblaster may have either made or used the arblast or cross-bow,\r\nmedieval Lat. arcubalista, bow-sling.  His name has given the\r\nimitative Alabaster.  We also find the shortened Ballister and\r\nBalestier, from which we have Bannister (Chapter III).  Or, to take an\r\nexample from comestibles, a Flanner limited his activity to the making\r\nof flat cakes called flans or flawns, from Old Fr. flaon (flan), a\r\nword of Germanic origin, ultimately related to flat\r\n\r\n\"He that is hanged in May will eat no flannes in Midsummer.\"\r\n\r\n(The Abbot, ch. xxxiii.)\r\n\r\nSome names have become strangely restricted in meaning, e.g. Mercer,\r\nnow almost limited to silk, was a name for a dealer in any kind of\r\nmerchandise (Lat. merx); in Old French it meant pedlar--\r\n\r\n\"Mercier, a good pedler, or meane haberdasher of small wares\"\r\n(Cotgrave).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Chandler, properly a candle-maker, is now used in\r\nthe compounds corn-chandler and ship's chandler.  Of all the -mongers\r\nthe only common survival is Ironmonger or Iremonger, with the variant\r\nIsemonger, from Mid. Eng. isen, iron.  Ironmonger is also dealer in\r\neggs, Mid. Eng. eiren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTHIERS\r\n\r\nThe wool trade occupied a very large number of workers and has given a\r\ngood many surnames.  The Shearer was distinct from the Shearman or\r\nSherman, the former operating on the sheep and the latter on the nap\r\nof the cloth.  For Comber we also have the older Kempster, and\r\nprobably Kimber, from the Mid. Eng. kemben, to comb, which survives in\r\n\"unkempt\".  The Walker, Fuller, and Tucker, all did very much the same\r\nwork of \"waulking,\" or trampling, the cloth.  All three words are used\r\nin Wyclif's Bible in variant renderings of Mark ix. 3.  Fuller is from\r\nFr. fouler, to trample, and Tucker is of uncertain origin.  Fuller is\r\nfound in the south and south-east, Tucker in the west, and Walker in\r\nthe north.  A Dyer was also called Dyster, and the same trade is the\r\norigin of the Latin-looking Dexter (Chapter II).  From Mid. Eng.\r\nlitster, a dyer, a word of Scandinavian origin, comes Lister, as in\r\nLister Gate, Nottingham.  With these goes the Wadman, who dealt in, or\r\ngrew, the dye-plant called woad; cf. Flaxman.  A beater of flax was\r\ncalled Swingler--\r\n\r\n\"Fleyl, swyngyl, verga, tribulum\"  (Prompt.  Parv.).\r\n\r\nA Tozer teased the cloth with a teasel.  In Mid. English the verb is\r\ntaesen or tosen, so that the names Teaser and Towser, sometimes given\r\nto bull-terriers, are doublets.  Secker means sack-maker.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the predominance of Taylor.  This is the more\r\nremarkable when we consider that the name has as rivals the native\r\nSeamer and Shapster and the imported Parmenter, Old Fr. parmentier, a\r\nmaker of parements, now used chiefly of facings on clothes.  But\r\nanother, and more usual, origin of Parmenter, Parminter, Parmiter, is\r\nparchmenter, a very important medieval trade.  The word would\r\ncorrespond to a Lat. pergamentarius, which has given also the German\r\nsurname Berminter.  Several old German cities had a Permentergasse,\r\ni.e. parchment-makers' street.  A Pilcher made pilches, i.e. fur\r\ncloaks, an early loan-word from Vulgar Lat. pellicia (pellis, skin).\r\nChaucer's version of\r\n\r\n\"Till May is out, ne'er cast a clout\"\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\"After greet heet cometh colde;\r\n No man caste his pilche away.\"\r\n\r\nAnother name connected with clothes is Chaucer, Old Fr. chaussier, a\r\nhosier (Lat. calceus, boot), while Admiral Hozier's Ghost reminds us\r\nof the native word.  The oldest meaning of hose seems to have been\r\ngaiters.  It ascended in Tudor times to the dignity of breeches (cf.\r\ntrunk-hose), the meaning it has in modern German.  Now it has become a\r\ntradesman's euphemism for the improper word stocking, a fact which led\r\na friend of the writer's, imperfectly acquainted with German, to ask a\r\ngifted lady of that nationality if she were a Blauhose.  A Chaloner or\r\nChawner dealt in shalloon, Mid. Eng. chalons, a material supposed to\r\nhave been made at Châlons-sur-Marne--\r\n\r\n\"And in his owene chambre hem made a bed,\r\n With sheetes and with chalons faire y-spred.\"\r\n\r\n(A. 4139.)\r\n\r\nGanter or Gaunter is Fr. gantier, glove-maker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAL WORKERS\r\n\r\nSome metal-workers have already been mentioned in connection with\r\nSmith (Chapter IV), and elsewhere.  The French Fèvre, from Lat. faber,\r\nis found as Feaver.  Fearon comes from Old Fr, feron, ferron, smith.\r\nFace le ferrun, i.e. Boniface (Chapter III) the smith, lived in\r\nNorthampton in the twelfth century.  This is an example of the French\r\nuse of -on as an agential suffix.  Another example is Old Fr. charton,\r\nor charreton, a waggoner, from the Norman form of which we have\r\nCarton.  In Scriven, from Old Fr. escrivain (écrivain), we have an\r\nisolated agential suffix.  The English form is usually lengthened to\r\nScrivener.  In Ferrier, for farrier, the traditional spelling has\r\nprevailed over the pronunciation, but we have the latter in Farrar.\r\nFerrier sometimes means ferryman, and Farrar has absorbed the common\r\nMid. English nickname Fayrhayr.  Aguilar means needle-maker, Fr.\r\naiguille, but Pinner is more often official (Chapter XIX).  Culler,\r\nFr. coutelier, Old Fr. coutel, knife, and Spooner go together, but the\r\nfork is a modern fad.  Poynter is another good example of the\r\nspecialization of medieval crafts: the points were the metal tags by\r\nwhich the doublet and hose were connected.  Hence, the play on words\r\nwhen Falstaff is recounting his adventure with the men in buckram--\r\n\r\nFal.  \"Their points being broken--\"\r\n\r\nPoins.  \"Down fell their hose.\"\r\n\r\n(I Henry IV., ii, 4.)\r\n\r\nLatimer, Latner sometimes means a worker in latten, a mixed metal of\r\nwhich the etymological origin is unknown.  The Pardoner--\r\n\r\n\"Hadde a croys of latoun ful of stones\" (A, 699).\r\n\r\nFor the change from -n to -m we may compare Lorimer for Loriner, a\r\nbridle-maker, belonging ultimately to Lat. lorum, \"the reyne of a\r\nbrydle\" (Cooper).  But Latimer comes also from Latiner, a man skilled\r\nin Latin, hence an interpreter, Sir John Mandeville tells us that, on\r\nthe way to Sinai--\r\n\r\n\"Men alleweys fynden Latyneres to go with hem in the contrees.\"\r\n\r\nThe immortal Bowdler is usually said to take his name from the art of\r\npuddling, or buddling, iron ore.  But, as this process is\r\ncomparatively modern, it is more likely that the name comes from the\r\nsame verb in its older meaning of making impervious to water by means\r\nof clay.  Monier and Minter are both connected with coining, the\r\nformer through French and the latter from Anglo-Saxon, both going back\r\nto Lat. moneta, [Footnote: On the curiously accidental history of this\r\nword see the Romance of Words, ch. x.]  mint.  Conner, i.e. coiner, is\r\nnow generally swallowed up by the Irish Connor.\r\n\r\nLeadbitter is for Leadbeater.  The name Hamper is a contraction of\r\nhanapier, a maker of hanaps, i.e. goblets.  Fr. hanap is from Old High\r\nGer. hnapf (Napf), and shows the inability of French to pronounce\r\ninitial hn- without inserting a vowel: cf. harangue from Old High Ger.\r\nhring.  There is also a Mid. Eng. nap, cup, representing the cognate\r\nAnglo-Sax. hnaep, so that the name Napper may sometimes be a doublet\r\nof Hamper, though it is more probably for Napier (Chapter I) or\r\nKnapper (Chapter XII).  The common noun hamper is from hanapier in a\r\nsense something like plate-basket.  With metal-workers we may also put\r\nFurber or Frobisher, i.e. furbisher, of armour, etc.  Poyser, from\r\npoise, scales, is official.  Two occupative names of Celtic origin are\r\nGow, a smith, as in The Fair Maid of Perth, and Caird, a tinker--\r\n\r\n\"The fellow had been originally a tinker or caird.\"\r\n\r\n(Heart of Midlothian, ch. xlix.)\r\n\r\nA few more names, which fall into no particular category, may conclude\r\nthe chapter.  Hillyer or Hellier is an old name for a Thacker, or\r\nthatcher, of which we have the Dutch form in Dekker.  It comes from\r\nMid. Eng. helen, to cover up.  In Hillard, Hillyard we sometimes have\r\nthe same name (cf. the vulgar scholard), but these are more often\r\nlocal (Chapter XIII).  Hellier also meant tiler, for the famous Wat is\r\ndescribed as tiler, tegheler, and hellier.\r\n\r\nAn Ashburner prepared wood-ash for the Bloomer (Chapter XV), and\r\nperhaps also for the Glaisher, or glass-maker, and Asher is best\r\nexplained in the same way, for we do not, I think, add -er to\r\ntree-names.  Apparent exceptions can be easily accounted for, e.g.\r\nElmer is Anglo-Sax. AElfmaer, and Beecher is Anglo-Fr. bechur, digger\r\n(Fr. bêche, spade).  Neither Pitman nor Collier had their modern\r\nmeaning of coal-miner.  Pitman is local, of the same class as\r\nBridgeman, Pullman, etc., and Collier meant a charcoal-burner, as in\r\nthe famous ballad of Rauf Colyear.  Not much coal was dug in the\r\nMiddle Ages.  Even in 1610 Camden speaks with disapproval, in his\r\nBritannia, of the inhabitants of Sherwood Forest who, with plenty of\r\nwood around them, persist in digging up \"stinking pit-cole.\"\r\n\r\nCroker is for Crocker, a maker of crocks or pitchers.  The Miller's\r\nguests only retired to bed--\r\n\r\n\"Whan that dronken al was in the crowke\" (A, 4158)\r\n\r\nThe spelling has affected the pronunciation, as in Sloper and Smoker\r\n(Chapter III).  Tinker is sometimes found as the frequentative\r\nTinkler, a name traditionally due to his approach being heralded by\r\nthe clatter of metal utensils--\r\n\r\n\"My bonny lass, I work on brass,\r\n A tinkler is my station.\"\r\n\r\n(BURNS, Jolly Beggars, Air 6.)\r\n\r\nThe maker of saddle-trees was called Fewster, from Old Fr. fust (fût),\r\nLat. fustis.  This has sometimes given Foster, but the latter is more\r\noften for Forster, i.e. Forester--\r\n\r\n\"An horn he bar, the bawdryk was of grene,\r\n A forster was he soothly as I gesse,\"\r\n\r\n(A, 116.)\r\n\r\nThe saddler himself was often called by his French name sellier,\r\nwhence Sella', but both this and Sellars are also local, at the\r\ncellars (Chapter III).  Pargeter means dauber, plasterer, from Old Fr.\r\nparjeter, to throw over.  A Straker made the strakes, or tires, of\r\nwheels.  A Stanger made stangs, i.e. poles, shafts, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fine arts are represented by Limmer, for limner, a painter, an\r\naphetic form of illumines, and Tickner is perhaps from Dutch tekener,\r\ndraughtsman, cognate with Eng, token, while the art of self-defence\r\nhas given us the name Scrimgeoure, with a number of corruptions,\r\nincluding the local-looking Skrimshire.  It is related to scrimmage\r\nand skirmish, and ultimately to Ger. schirmen, to fence, lit.  to\r\nprotect.  The name was applied to a professional swordplayer--\r\n\r\n\"Qe nul teigne escole de eskermerye ne de bokeler deins la citee.\"\r\n\r\n(Liber Albus.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURNOMINAL SNOBBISHNESS\r\n\r\nA particularly idiotic form of snobbishness has sometimes led people\r\nto advance strange theories as to the origin of their names.  Thus\r\nTurner has been explained as from la tour noire.  Dr. Brewer, in his\r\nDictionary of Phrase and Fable, [Footnote: Thirteenth edition, revised\r\nand corrected.]  apparently desirous of dissociating himself from malt\r\nliquor, observes that--\r\n\r\n\"Very few ancient names are the names of trades. . .  A few examples\r\nof a more scientific derivation will suffice for a hint:--\r\n\r\nBrewer.  This name, which exists in France as Bruhière and Brugère, is\r\nnot derived from the Saxon briwan (to brew), but the French bruyère\r\n(heath), and is about tantamount to the German Plantagenet (broom\r\nplant).  Miller is the old Norse melia, our mill and maul, and means a\r\nmauler or fighter.\r\n\r\nRinger is the Anglo-Saxon hring-gar (the mailed warrior).  Tanner,\r\nGerman Thanger, Old German Dane-gaud, is the Dane-Goth...\r\n\r\nThis list might easily be extended.\"\r\n\r\nThere is of course no reason why such a list should not be\r\nindefinitely extended, but the above excerpt is probably quite long\r\nenough to make the reader feel dizzy.  The fact is that there is no\r\ngetting away from a surname of this class, and the bearer must try to\r\nlook on the brighter side of the tragedy.  Brewer is occasionally an\r\naccommodated form of the French name Bruyère or Labruyère, but is\r\nusually derived from an occupation which is the high-road to the House\r\nof Lords.  The ancestor of any modern Barber may, like Salvation Yeo's\r\nfather, have \"exercised the mystery of a barber-surgeon,\" which is\r\ngetting near the learned professions.  A Pottinger (Chapter XV) looked\r\nafter the soups, Fr. potage, but the name also represents Pothecary\r\n(apothecary), which had in early Scottish the aphetic forms Poticar,\r\npotigar--\r\n\r\n\"'Pardon me,' said he, 'I am but a poor pottingar.  Nevertheless, I\r\nhave been bred in Paris and learnt my humanities and my cursus\r\nmedendi'\"\r\n\r\n(Fair Maid of Perth, ch. vii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. HODGE AND HIS FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\"Jacque, il me faut troubler ton Somme;\r\n Dans le village, un gros huissier\r\n Rôde et court, suivi du messier.\r\n C'est pour l'impôt, las!  mon pauvre homme.\r\n Lève-toi, Jacque, lève-toi:\r\n Voici venir I'huissier du roi.\"\r\n\r\nBÉRANGER.\r\n\r\nGeneral terms for what we now usually call a farmer are preserved in\r\nthe surnames Bond (Chapter XV), whence the compound Husband, used both\r\nfor the goodman of the house and in the modern sense, and Tillman.\r\nThe labouring man was Day, from the same root as Ger. Dienen, to\r\nserve.  It persists in \"dairy\" and perhaps in the puzzling name\r\nDoubleday (?  doing two men's work).  A similar meaning is contained\r\nin the names Swain, Hind, for earlier Hine (Chapter III), Tasker,\r\nMann.  But a Wager was a mercenary soldier.  The mower has given us\r\nthe names Mather (cf. aftermath), and Mawer, while Fenner is sometimes\r\nfor Old Fr. feneur, haymaker (Lat. foenum, hay).  For mower we also\r\nfind the latinized messor, whence Messer.  Whether the Ridler and the\r\nSivier made, or used, riddles and sieves can hardly be decided.\r\n[Footnote: Riddle is the usual word for sieve in the Midlands.  Hence\r\nthe phrase \"riddled with holes, or wounds.\"]\r\n\r\nWith the Wenman, who drove the wain, we may mention the Leader or\r\nLoader.  The verbs \"lead\" and \"load\" are etymologically the same, and\r\nin the Midlands people talk of \"leading,\" i.e. carting, coal.  But\r\nthese names could also come from residence near an artificial\r\nwatercourse (Chapter XIII).  Beecher has already been explained, and\r\nShoveler is formed in the same way from dialect showl, a shovel--\r\n\r\n\" 'I,' said the owl,\r\n\r\n  'With my spade and showl.' \"\r\n\r\nTo the variants of the Miller (Chapter XXIII) may be added Mulliner,\r\nfrom Old French.  Tedder means a man who teds, i.e. spreads, hay, the\r\norigin of the word being Scandinavian\r\n\r\n\"I teede hey, I tourne it afore it is made in cockes, je fene.\"\r\n(Palsgrave.)\r\n\r\nBut the greater number of surnames drawn from rural occupations are\r\nconnected with the care of animals.  We find names of this class in\r\nthree forms, exemplified by Coltman, Goater, Shepherd, and it seems\r\nlikely that the endings -er and -erd have sometimes been interchanged,\r\ne.g. that Goater may stand for goat-herd, Calver for calf-herd, and\r\nNutter sometimes for northern nowt-herd, representing the dialect\r\nneat-herd.  The compounds of herd include Bullard, Calvert, Coltard,\r\nCoward, for cow-herd, not of course to be confused with the common\r\nnoun coward (Fr. couard, a derivative of Lat. cauda, tail), Evart,\r\newe-herd, but also a Norman spelling of Edward, Geldard, Goddard,\r\nsometimes for goat-herd, Hoggart, often confused with the local\r\nHogarth (Chapter XIII), Seward, for sow-herd, or for the historic\r\nSiward, Stobart, dialect stob, a bull, Stodart, Mid. Eng. stot,\r\nmeaning both a bullock and a nag.  Chaucer tells us that--\r\n\r\n\"This reve sat upon a ful good stot\" (A, 615 ).\r\n\r\nStoddart is naturally confused with Studdart, stud-herd, stud being\r\ncognate with Ger. Stute, mare.  We also have Swinnert, and lastly\r\nWeatherhead, sometimes a perversion of wether-herd, though usually a\r\nnickname, sheep's head.  The man in charge of the tups, or rams, was\r\ncalled Tupman or Tupper, the latter standing sometimes for tup-herd,\r\njust as we have the imitative Stutter for Stodart or Studdart.  We\r\nhave also Tripper from trip, a dialect word for flock, probably\r\nrelated to troop.  Another general term for a herdsman was Looker,\r\nwhence Luker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUMBLEDOM\r\n\r\nI have headed this chapter \"Hodge and his Friends,\" but as, a matter\r\nof strict truth he had none, except the \"poure Persons,\" the most\r\nradiant figure in Chaucer's pageant.  But his enemies were\r\ninnumerable.  Béranger's lines impress one less than the uncouth \"Song\r\nof the Husbandman\" (temp.  Edward I.), in which we find the woes of\r\npoor Hodge incorporated in the persons of the hayward, the bailif, the\r\nwodeward, the budel and his cachereles (catchpoles)--\r\n\r\n\"For ever the furthe peni mot (must) to the kynge.\"\r\n\r\nThe bailiff has already been mentioned (Chapter IV).  The budel, or\r\nbeadle, has given us several surnames.  We have the word in two forms,\r\nfrom Anglo-Sax. bytel, belonging to the verb to bid, whence the names\r\nBiddle and Buddle, and from Old Fr. bedel (bedeau), whence Beadle and\r\nits variants.  The animal is probably extinct under his original name,\r\nbut modern democracy is doing its best to provide him with an army of\r\nsuccessors.  The \"beadle\" group of names has been confused with\r\nBithell, Welsh Ap Ithel.\r\n\r\nNames in -ward are rather numerous, and, as they mostly come from the\r\ntitles of rural officials and are often confused with compounds of\r\n-herd, they are all put together here.  The simple Ward, cognate with\r\nFr. garde, is one of our commonest surnames.  Like its derivative\r\nWarden it had a very wide range of meanings.  The antiquity of the\r\noffice of church-warden is shown by the existence of the surname\r\nChurchward.  Sometimes the surname comes from the abstract or local\r\nsense, de la warde.  As the suffix -weard occurs very frequently in\r\nAnglo-Saxon personal names, it is not always possible to say whether a\r\nsurname is essentially occupative or not, e.g. whether Durward is\r\nrather \"door-ward\" or for Anglo-Sax. Deorweard.  Howard, which is\r\nphonetically Old Fr. Huard, is sometimes also for Hayward or Haward\r\n(Hereward), or for Hayward.  It has no doubt interchanged with the\r\nlocal Howarth, Haworth.\r\n\r\nOwing to the loss of w- in the second part of a word (Chapter III),\r\n-ward and -herd often fall together, e.g. Millard for Milward, and\r\nWoodard found in Mid. English as both wode-ward and wode-hird.\r\nHayward belongs to hay, hedge, enclosure (Chapter XIII), from which we\r\nalso get Hayman.  The same functionary has given the name Haybittle, a\r\ncompound of beadle.  Burward and Burrard may represent the once\r\nfamiliar office of bear-ward; cf. Berman.  I had a schoolfellow called\r\nLateward, apparently the man in charge of the lade or leet (Chapter\r\nXIII).  Medward is for mead-ward.\r\n\r\nThe name Stewart or Stuart became royal with Walter the Steward of\r\nScotland, who married Marjorie Bruce in 1315.  It stands for sty-ward,\r\nwhere sty means pen, not necessarily limited to pigs.  Like most\r\nofficial titles, it has had its ups and downs, with the result that\r\nits present meaning ranges from a high officer of the crown to the\r\nsympathetic concomitant of a rough crossing.\r\n\r\nThe Reeve, Anglo-Sax. ge-refa, was in Chaucer a kind of land agent,\r\nbut the name was also applied to local officials, as in port-reeve,\r\nshire-reeve.  It is the same as Grieve, also originally official, but\r\nused in Scotland of a land steward--\r\n\r\n\"He has got a ploughman from Scotland who acts as grieve.\"\r\n\r\n(Scott, Diary, 1814.)\r\n\r\nThis may be one source of the names Graves and Greaves.  The name\r\nWoodruff, Woodroffe is too common to be referred to the plant\r\nwoodruff, and the fact that the male and female of a species of\r\nsand-piper are called the ruff and reeve suggests that Woodruff may\r\nhave some relation to wood-reeve.  It is at any rate a curious\r\ncoincidence that the German name for the plant is Waldmeister,\r\nwood-master.  Another official surname especially connected with\r\ncountry life is Pinder, also found as Pinner, Pender, Penner, Ponder\r\nand Poynder, the man in charge of the pound or pinfold; cf. Parker,\r\nthe custodian of a park, of which the Palliser or Pallister made the\r\npalings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITINERANT MERCHANTS\r\n\r\nThe itinerant dealer was usually called by a name suggesting the pack\r\nwhich he carried.  Thus Badger, Kidder, Kiddier, Pedder, now pedlar,\r\nare from bag, kid, related to kit, and the obsolete ped, basket; cf.\r\nLeaper, Chapter XV.  The badger, who dealt especially in corn, was\r\nunpopular with the rural population, and it is possible that his name\r\nwas given to the stealthy animal formerly called the bawson (Chapter\r\nI.), brock or gray (Chapter XXIII).  That Badger is a nickname taken\r\nfrom the animal is chronologically improbable, as the word is first\r\nrecorded in 1523 (New English Dictionary).\r\n\r\nTo the above names may be added Cremer, Cramer, a huckster with a\r\nstall in the market, but this surname is sometimes of modern\r\nintroduction, from its German cognate Krämer, now generally used for a\r\ngrocer.  Packman, Pakeman, and Paxman belong more probably to the\r\nfont-name Pack (Chapter IX), which also appears in Paxon, either\r\nPack's son, or for the local Paxton.\r\n\r\nThe name Hawker does not belong to this group.  Nowadays a hawker is a\r\npedlar, and it has been assumed, without sufficient evidence, that the\r\nword is of the same origin as huckster.  The Mid. Eng. le haueker or\r\nhaukere (1273) is quite plainly connected with hawk, and the name may\r\nhave been applied either to a Falconer, Faulkner, or to a dealer in\r\nhawks.  As we know that itinerant vendors of hawks travelled from\r\ncastle to castle, it is quite possible that our modern hawker is an\r\nextended use of the same name.\r\n\r\nNor is the name Coster to be referred to costermonger, originally a\r\ndealer in costards, i.e. apples.  It is sometimes for Mid. Eng.\r\ncostard (cf. such names as Cherry and Plumb), but may also represent\r\nPort.  da Costa and Ger. Köster, both of which are found in early\r\nlists of Protestant refugees.\r\n\r\nJagger was a north-country name for a man who worked draught-horses\r\nfor hire.  Mr. Hardy's novel Under the Greenwood Tree opens with \"the\r\nTranter's party.\" A carrier is still a \"tranter\" in Wessex.  In\r\nMedieval Latin he was called travetarius, a word apparently connected\r\nwith Lat. transvehere, to transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. OFFICIAL AND DOMESTIC\r\n\r\n\"Big fleas have little fleas\r\n Upon their backs to bite 'em\r\n Little fleas have smaller fleas,\r\n And so ad infinitum.\"\r\n\r\nAnon.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that official nomenclature largely reflects\r\nthe simple housekeeping of early times, and that many titles, now of\r\ngreat dignity, were originally associated with rather lowly duties.\r\nWe have seen an example in Stewart.  Another is Chamberlain.  Hence\r\nsurnames drawn from this class are susceptible of very varied\r\ninterpretation.  A Chancellor was originally a man in charge of a\r\nchancel, or grating, Lat. cancelli.  In Mid. English it is usually\r\nglossed scriba, while it is now limited to very high judicial or\r\npolitical office.  Bailey, as we have seen (Chapter IV), has also a\r\nwide range of meanings, the ground idea being that of care-taker.\r\nCotgrave explains Old Fr. mareschal maréchal as--\r\n\r\n\"A marshall of a kingdoms, or of a camp (an honourable place); also, a\r\nblacksmith; also, a farrier, horse-leech, or horse-smith; also, a\r\nharbinger,\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: i.e. a quartermaster.  See Romance of Words, ch. vii.]\r\n\r\nwhich gives a considerable choice of origins to any modern Marshall or\r\nMaskell.\r\n\r\nAnother very vague term is sergeant, whence our Sargent.  Its oldest\r\nmeaning is servant, Lat. serviens, servient--.  Cotgrave defines\r\nsergent as--\r\n\r\n\"A sergeant, officer, catchpole, pursuyvant, apparitor; also (in Old\r\nFr.) a footman, or souldier that serves on foot.\" I\r\n\r\nProbably catchpole was the commonest meaning--\r\n\r\n\"Sargeauntes, katche pollys, and somners\" (Cocke Lorelles Bote).\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice occupied a horde of officials, from the\r\nJustice down to the Catchpole.  The official title Judge is rarely\r\nfound, and this surname is usually from the female name Judge, which,\r\nlike Jug, was used for Judith, and later for Jane--\r\n\r\n\"Jannette, Judge, Jennie; a woman's name\" (Cotgrave).\r\n\r\nThe names Judson and Juxon sometimes belong to these.  Catchpole has\r\nnothing to do with poles or polls.  It is a Picard cache-poule\r\n(chasse-poule), collector of poultry in default of money.  Another\r\nname for judge was Dempster, the pronouncer of doom, a title which\r\nstill exists in the Isle of Man.  We also find Deemer--\r\n\r\n\"Demar, judicator\" (Prompt.  Parv.).\r\n\r\nMayor is a learned spelling of Mair, Fr. maire, Lat. major, but Major,\r\nwhich looks like its latinized form, is perhaps imitative for the Old\r\nFrench personal name Mauger.  Bishop Mauger of Worcester pronounced\r\nthe interdict in 1208, and the surname still exists.\r\n\r\nGaylor, Galer, is the Norman pronunciation of gaoler--\r\n\r\n\"And Palamon, this woful prisoner,\r\n As was his wone, bi leve of his gayler,\r\n Was risen\"  (A, 1064).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSEHOLD\r\n\r\nUsher is Fr. huissier, door-keeper, Fr. huis, door, Lat. ostium.  I\r\nconjecture that Lusher is the French name Lhuissier, and that Lush is\r\nlocal, for Old Fr. le huis; cf. Laporte.  Wait, corruptly Weight, now\r\nused only of a Christmas minstrel, was once a watchman.  It is a\r\ndialect form of Old Fr. gaite, cognate with watch.  The older sense\r\nsurvives in the expression \"to lie in wait.\"  Gate is the same name,\r\nwhen not local (Chapter XIII).\r\n\r\nThe Todhunter, or fox-hunter (Chapter XXIII), was an official whose\r\nduty was to exterminate the animal now so carefully preserved.  Warner\r\nis often for Warrener.  The Grosvenor (gros veneur), great hunter, was\r\na royal servant.  Bannerman is found latinized as Penninger (Chapter\r\nXV).  Herald may be official or from Harold (Chapter VII), the\r\nderivation being in any case the same.  Toller means a collector of\r\ntolls.  Cocke Lorelle speaks of these officials as \"false Towlers.\"\r\nConnected with administration is the name Mainprice, lit.  taken by\r\nhand, used both for a surety and a man out on bail--\r\n\r\n\"Maynprysyd, or memprysyd, manucaptus, fideijussus\" (Prompt.  Parv.);\r\n\r\nand Shurety also exists.\r\n\r\nThe individual bigwig had a very large retinue, the members of which\r\nappear to have held very strongly to the theory of one man, one job.\r\nThe Nurse, or Norris, Fr. nourrice, was apparently debarred from\r\nrocking the cradle.  This was the duty of the rocker--\r\n\r\n\"To the norice and rokker of the same lord, 25s.  8d.\"\r\n\r\n(Household Accounts of Elizabeth of York, March, 1503),\r\n\r\nfrom whom Mr. Roker, chief turnkey at the Fleet in Mr. Pickwick's\r\ntime, may have sprung The Cook was assisted by the Baster and Hasler,\r\nor turnspit, the latter from Old Fr. hastille, spit, dim. of Lat.\r\nhasta, spear.  The Chandler was a servant as well as a manufacturer.\r\n\r\nA Trotter and a Massinger, i.e. messenger, were perhaps much the same\r\nthing.  Wardroper is of course wardrobe keeper, but Chaucer uses\r\nwardrope (B. 1762) in the sense which Fr. garde-robe now usually has.\r\nThe Lavender, Launder or Lander saw to the washing.  Napier, from Fr.\r\nnappe, cloth, meant the servant who looked after the napery.  The\r\nmartial sound with which this distinguished name strikes a modern ear\r\nis due to historical association, assisted, as I have somewhere read,\r\nby its riming with rapier!  The water-supply was in charge of the\r\nEwer.\r\n\r\nThe provisioning of the great house was the work of the Lardner, Fr.\r\nlard, bacon, the Panter, or Pantler, who was, at least etymologically,\r\nresponsible for bread, and the Cator (Chapter III) and Spencer\r\n(Chapter III), whose names, though of opposite meaning, buyer and\r\nspender, come to very much the same thing.  Spence is still the\r\nnorth-country word for pantry, and is used by Tennyson in the sense of\r\nrefectory--\r\n\r\n\"Bluff Harry broke into the Spence\r\n And turn'd the cowls adrift.\"\r\n\r\n(The Talking Oak, 1.  47.)\r\n\r\nPurser, now used in connection with ships only, was also a medieval\r\nform of bursar, and every castle and monastery had its almoner, now\r\nAmner.  Here also belongs Carver.  In Ivey Church (Bucks) is a tablet\r\nto Lady Mary Salter with a poetic tribute to her husband--\r\n\r\n\"Full forty years a carver to two kings.\"\r\n\r\nAs the importance of the horse led to the social elevation of the\r\nmarshal and constable (Chapter IV), so the hengstman, now henchman,\r\nbecame his master's right-hand man.  The first element is Anglo-Sax.\r\nhengest, stallion, and its most usual surnominal forms are Hensman and\r\nHinxman.  Historians now regard Hengist and Horsa, stallion and mare,\r\nas nicknames assumed by Jutish braves on the war-path.  Sumpter, Old\r\nFr. sommetier, from Somme, burden, was used both of a packhorse and\r\nits driver, its interpretation in King Lear being a matter of dispute--\r\n\r\n\"Return with her?\r\n Persuade me rather to be slave and Sumpter\r\n To this detested groom\" (Lear, ii, 4).\r\n\r\nAs a surname it probably means the driver, Medieval Lat. sumetarius.\r\n\r\nAmong those who ministered to the great man's pleasures we must\r\nprobably reckon Spelman, Speller, Spillman, Spiller, from Mid. Eng.\r\nspel, a speech, narrative, but proof of this is lacking\r\n\r\n\"Now holde your mouth, par charitee,\r\n Bothe knyght and lady free,\r\n And herkneth to my spelle\" (B, 2081).\r\n\r\nThe cognate Spielmann, lit.  Player, was used in Medieval German of a\r\nwandering minstrel.\r\n\r\nThe poet is now Rymer or Rimmer, while Trover, Fr. trouvère, a poet,\r\nminstrel, lit.  finder, has been confused with Trower, for Thrower, a\r\nname connected with weaving.  Even the jester has come down to us as\r\nPatch, a name given regularly to this member of the household in\r\nallusion to his motley attire.  Shylock applies it, to Launcelot--\r\n\r\n\"The patch is kind enough; but a huge feeder.\"\r\n\r\n(Merchant of Venice, ii.  5.)\r\n\r\nBut the name has another origin (Chapter IX).  Buller and Cocker are\r\nnames taken from the fine old English sports of bull-baiting and\r\ncock-fighting.\r\n\r\nTwo very humble members of the parasitic class have given the names\r\nBidder and Maunder, both meaning beggar.  The first comes from Mid.\r\nEng. bidden, to ask.  Piers Plowman speaks of \"bidderes and beggers.\"\r\nMaunder is perhaps connected with Old Fr. quemander--\r\n\r\n\"Quemander, or caimander, to beg; or goe a begging; to beg from doore\r\nto doore\" (Cotgrave),\r\n\r\nbut it may mean a maker of \"maunds,\" i.e. baskets.\r\n\r\nA Beadman spent his time in praying for his benefactor.  A medieval\r\nunderling writing to his superior often signs himself \"your servant\r\nand bedesman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. OF NICKNAMES IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n\"Here is Wyll Wyly the myl pecker,\r\n And Patrick Pevysshe heerbeter,\r\n With lusty Hary Hangeman,\r\n Nexte house to Robyn Renawaye;\r\n Also Hycke Crokenec the rope maker,\r\n And Steven Mesyllmouthe muskyll taker.\"\r\n\r\n(Cocke Lorelles Bote.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote: This humorous poem, inspired by Sebastian Brandt's\r\nNarrenschiff, known in England in Barclay's translation, was printed\r\nearly in the reign of Henry VIII.  It contains the fullest list we\r\nhave of old trade-names.]\r\n\r\nEvery family name is etymologically a nickname, i.e. an eke-name,\r\nintended to give that auxiliary information which helps in\r\nidentification.  But writers on surnames have generally made a special\r\nclass of those epithets which were originally conferred on the bearer\r\nin connection with some characteristic feature, physical or moral, or\r\nsome adjunct, often of the most trifling description, with which his\r\npersonality was associated.  Of nicknames, as of other things, it may\r\nbe said that there is nothing new under the sun.  Ovidius Naso might\r\nhave received his as a schoolboy, and Moss cum nano, whom we find in\r\nSuffolk in 1184, lives on as \"Nosey Moss\" in Whitechapel.  Some of our\r\nnicknames occur as personal names in Anglo-Saxon times (Chapter VII),\r\nbut as surnames they are seldom to be traced back to that period, for\r\nthe simple reason that such names were not hereditary.  An Anglo-Saxon\r\nmight be named Wulf, but his son would bear another name, while our\r\nmodern Wolfe does not usually go farther back than some Ranulf le wolf\r\nof the thirteenth or fourteenth century.  This is of course stating\r\nthe case broadly, because the personal name Wolf also persisted and\r\nbecame in some cases a surname.  In this and the following chapters I\r\ndo not generally attempt to distinguish between such double origins.\r\n\r\nNicknames are formed in very many ways, but the two largest classes\r\nare sobriquets taken from the names of animals, e.g. Hogg, or from\r\nadjectives, either alone or accompanied by a noun, e.g. Dear,\r\nGoodfellow.  Each of these classes requires a chapter to itself, while\r\nhere we may deal with the smaller groups.\r\n\r\nSome writers have attempted to explain all apparent nicknames as\r\npopular perversions of surnames belonging to the other three classes.\r\nAs the reader will already have noticed, such perversions are\r\nextremely common, but it is a mistake to try to account for obvious\r\nnicknames in this way.  Any of us who retain a vivid recollection of\r\nearly days can call to mind nicknames of the most fantastic kind, and\r\nin some cases of the most apparently impossible formation, which stuck\r\nto their possessors all through school-life.  A very simple test for\r\nthe genuineness of a nickname is a comparison with other languages.\r\nCamden says that Drinkwater is a corruption of Derwentwater.  The\r\nincorrectness of this guess is shown by the existence as surnames of\r\nFr. Boileau, It.  Bevilacqua, and Ger. Trinkwasser.  It is in fact a\r\nperfectly natural nickname for a medieval eccentric, the more normal\r\nattitude being represented by Roger Beyvin (boi-vin), who died in\r\nLondon in 1277.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN NICKNAMES\r\n\r\nCorresponding to our Goodday, we find Ger. Gutentag and Fr. Bonjour.\r\nThe latter has been explained as from a popular form of George, but\r\nthe English and German names show that the explanation is.\r\nunnecessary.  With Dry we may compare Fr. Lesec and Ger. Dürr, with\r\nGarlick Ger. Knoblauch (Chapter XV), and with Shakespeare Ger.\r\nSchüttespeer.  Luck is both for Luke and Luick (Liège, Chapter XI),\r\nbut Rosa Bonheur and the composer Gluck certify it also as a nickname.\r\nMerryweather is like Fr. Bontemps, and Littleboy appears in the Paris\r\nDirectory as Petitgas, gas being the same as gars, the old nominative\r\n(Chapter I) of garçon--\r\n\r\n\"Gars, a lad, boy, stripling, youth, yonker\" (Cotgrave).\r\n\r\nBardsley explains Twentyman as an imitative corruption of twinter-man,\r\nthe man in charge of the twinters, two-year-old colts.  This may be\r\nso, but there is a German confectioner in Hampstead called Zwanziger,\r\nand there are Parisians named Vingtain.  Lover is confirmed by the\r\nFrench surnames Amant and Lamoureux, and Wellbeloved by Bienaimé.\r\nAllways may be the literal equivalent of the French name Partout.  On\r\nthe other hand, the name Praisegod Barebones has been wrongly fixed on\r\nan individual whose real name was Barbon or Barborne.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that the nickname, conferred essentially on the\r\nindividual, and often of a very offensive character, should have\r\npersisted and become hereditary.  But schoolboys know that, in the\r\ncase of an unpleasant nickname, the more you try to pull it off, the\r\nmore it sticks the faster.  Malapert and Lehideux are still well\r\nrepresented in the Paris Directory.  Many objectionable nicknames\r\nhave, however, disappeared, or have been so modified as to become\r\ninoffensive.\r\n\r\nSometimes such disappearance has resulted from the depreciation in the\r\nmeaning of a word, e.g. le lewd, the layman, the unlettered, was once\r\nas common as its opposite le learned, whence the name Larned.  But\r\nmany uncomplimentary names are no longer objected to because their\r\nowners do not know their earlier meanings.  A famous hymn-writer of\r\nthe eighteenth century bore all unconsciously a surname that would\r\nalmost have made Rabelais blush.  Drinkdregs, Drunkard, Sourale,\r\nSparewater, Sweatinbed, etc. have gone, but we still have Lusk--\r\n\r\n\"Falourdin, a luske, loot, lurden, a lubberlie sloven, heavie sot,\r\nlumpish hoydon\" (Cotgrave)--\r\n\r\nand many other names which can hardly have gratified their original\r\npossessors.\r\n\r\nA very interesting group of surnames consists of those which indicate\r\ndegrees of kinship or have to do with the relations existing between\r\nindividuals.  We find both Master and Mann, united in Masterman,\r\nmeaning the man in the service of one locally known as the master.\r\nWith this we may compare Ladyman, Priestman, etc. But Mann is often of\r\nlocal origin, from the Isle of Man.  In some cases such names are\r\nusually found with the patronymic -s, e.g. Masters, Fellows, while in\r\nothers this is regularly absent, e.g. Guest, Friend.  The latter name\r\nis sometimes a corruption of Mid. Eng. fremed, stranger, cognate with\r\nGer. fremd, so that opposite terms, which we find regularly contrasted\r\nin Mid. Eng. \"frend and fremed,\" have become absorbed in one surname.\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of Fellows is due to its being sometimes for\r\nthe local Fallows.  From Mid. Eng. fere, a companion, connected with\r\nfaren, to travel, we get Littlefair and Playfair.  In Wyclif's Bible\r\nwe read that Jephthah's daughter--\r\n\r\n\"Whanne sche hadde go with hir felowis and pleiferis, sche biwept hir\r\nmaydynhed in the hillis\" (Judges xi.  38).\r\n\r\nSpringett is for springald, and Arlett is Mid. Eng. harlot, fellow,\r\nrascal, a word which has changed its gender and meaning--\r\n\r\n\"He was a gentil harlot and a kynde,\r\n A betre felawe sholde men noght fynde.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 647.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKINSHIP\r\n\r\nIn surnames taken from words indicating family relationship we come\r\nacross some survivals of terms no longer used, or occurring only in\r\nrustic dialect.  The Mid. Eng. eme, uncle, cognate with Ger. Oheim,\r\nhas given Eames.  In Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, the heroine\r\naddresses Pandarus as \"uncle dere\" and \"uncle mine,\" but also uses the\r\nolder word--\r\n\r\n\"'In good feith, em,' quod she, 'that liketh me'\" (ii.  162);\r\n\r\nand the word is used more than once by Scott--\r\n\r\n\"Didna his eme die. . .  wi' the name of the Bluidy Mackenzie?\"\r\n\r\n(Heart of Midlothian, ch. xii.)\r\n\r\nIt is also one of the sources of Empson, which thus corresponds to\r\nCousins or Cozens.  In Neame we have a prosthetic n- due to the\r\nfrequent occurrence of min eme (cf. the Shakespearean nuncle, Lear, i.\r\n4).  The names derived from cousin have been reinforced by those from\r\nCuss, i.e. Constant or Constance (Chapter X).  Thus Cussens is from\r\nthe Mid. English dim. Cussin.  Anglo-Sax. nefa, whence Mid. Eng. neve,\r\nneave, is cognate with, but not derived from, Lat. nepos.  [Footnote:\r\nIn all books on surnames that I have come across this is referred to\r\nOld Fr. le neve.  There is no such word in old French, which has nom.\r\nniés, acc.  neveu.]\r\n\r\nThis is now replaced as a common noun by the French word nephew, but\r\nit survives in the surname Neave.  It also meant in Mid. English a\r\nprodigal or parasite, as did also Lat. nepos--\r\n\r\n\"Neve, neverthryfte, or wastowre\"  (Prompt.  Parv.).\r\n\r\nIt is likely that Nevison and Nevinson are sometimes derivatives of\r\nthis word.\r\n\r\nChild was sometimes used in the special sense of youth of gentle\r\nblood, or young knight; cf. Childe Harold and Childe Rowland (Lear,\r\niii.  4).  But the more general meaning may be assumed in its\r\ncompounds, of which the most interesting is Leifchild, dear-child, a\r\nfairly common name in Anglo-Saxon.  The corresponding Faunt, whence\r\nFauntleroy (Chapter XV), is now rare.  Another word, now only used in\r\ndialect or by affectation, is \"bairn,\" a frequent source of the very\r\ncommon surname Barnes; cf. Fairbairn and Goodbairn, often perverted to\r\nFairburn, Goodburn, Goodban.  Barnfather is about equivalent to Lat.\r\npaterfamilias, but Pennefather is an old nickname for a miser--\r\n\r\n\"Caqueduc, a niggard, micher, miser, scrape-good, pinch-penny,\r\npenny-father; a covetous and greedy wretch\" (Cotgrave).\r\n\r\nThe name Bastard was once considered no disgrace if the dishonour came\r\nfrom a noble source, and several great medieval warriors bore this\r\nsobriquet.  With this we may compare Leman or Lemon, Mid. Eng.\r\nleof-man, dear man, beloved, and Paramor, Fr. par amour, an example of\r\nan adverbial phrase that has become a noun.  This expression, used of\r\nlawful love in Old French, in the stock phrase \"aimer une belle dame\r\npar amour,\" had already an evil meaning by Chaucer's time--\r\n\r\n\"My fourthe housbonde was a revelour,\r\n This is to seyn, he hadde a paramour\" (D, 453).\r\n\r\nWith these names we may put Drewry or Drury, sweetheart, from the Old\r\nFrench abstract druerie, of Germanic origin and cognate with true--\r\n\r\n\"For certeynly no such beeste\r\n To be loved is not worthy,\r\n Or bere the name of druerie.\"\r\n\r\n(Romaunt of the Rose, 5062.)\r\n\r\nSuckling is a nickname applied to a helpless person; cf. Littlechild\r\nand \"milksop,\" which still exists, though rare, in the forms Milsopp\r\nand Mellsop.  The heir survives as Ayre and Eyre.  Batchelor, the\r\norigin of which is one of the etymological problems yet unsolved, had\r\nin Old French and Mid. English also the meaning of young warrior or\r\nsquire.  Chaucer's Squier is described as--\r\n\r\n\"A lovyere and a lusty bacheler\" (A, 80).\r\n\r\nMay, maiden, whence Mildmay, is used by Chaucer for the Holy Virgin\r\n\r\n\"Now, lady bright, to whom alle woful cryen,\r\n Thow glorie of wommanhede, thow faire may,\r\n Thow haven of refut, brighte sterre of day\" (B, 850).\r\n\r\nThis is the same word as Mid. Eng. mai, relative, cognate with maid\r\nand Gaelic Mac- (Chapter VI).  A form of it survives in the Nottingham\r\nname Watmough and perhaps in Hickmott--\r\n\r\n\"Mow, housbandys sister or syster in law\" (Prompt.  Parv.).\r\n\r\nI imagine that William Echemannesmai, who owed the Treasury a mark in\r\n1182, was one of the sponging fraternity.\r\n\r\nVirgoe, a latinization of Virgin, is perhaps due to a shop-sign.\r\nRigmaiden, explained by Lower as \"a romping girl,\" is local, from a\r\nplace in Westmorland.  Richard de Riggemayden was living in Lancashire\r\nin 1307.  With this group of names we may put Gossip, originally a\r\ngod-parent, lit.  related in God, from Mid. Eng. sib, kin.\r\n\r\nWith names like Farebrother, Goodfellow, we may compare some of French\r\norigin such as Bonser (bon sire), Bonamy, and Bellamy\r\n\r\n\"Thou beel amy, thou pardoner, he sayde,\r\n Telle us som myrth, or japes, right anon.\"\r\n\r\n(B, 318.)\r\n\r\nBeldam (belle dame), originally a complimentary name for grandmother\r\nor grandam, has become uncomplimentary in meaning--\r\n\r\nFirst Witch.  \"Why, how now, Hecate!  you look angerly.\"\r\n\r\nHecate.  \"Have I not reason, beldams as you are,\r\nSaucy and overbold?\" (Macbeth, iii.  5).\r\n\r\nFrom the corresponding Old Fr. bel-sire, beau-sire, we have Bewsher,\r\nBowser, and the Picard form Belcher\r\n\r\n\"The great belsire, the grandsire, sire, and sonne,\r\n Lie here interred under this grave stone.\"\r\n\r\n(Weever, Ancient Funeral Monuments.)\r\n\r\nRelationship was often expressed by the use of French words, so that\r\nfor son-in-law we find Gender, Ginder, corresponding to Fr. Legendre.\r\nFitch, usually an animal nickname (Chapter XXIII), is occasionally for\r\nle fiz, the son, which also survives as Fitz.  Goodson, from the\r\npersonal name Good (Chapter I), is sometimes registered as Fiz Deu.\r\nCf. Fr. Lefilleul, i.e. the godson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACTS\r\n\r\nA possible derivative of the name May (Chapter XXI) is Ivimey.  Holly\r\nand Ivy were the names of characters in Christmas games, and an old\r\nrime says\r\n\r\n\"Holy and his mery men, they dawnsyn and they syng,\r\n Ivy and hur maydins, they wepen and they wryng.\"\r\n\r\nIf Ivimey is from this source, the same origin must sometimes be\r\nallowed to Holliman (Chapter I).  This conjecture [Footnote: Probably\r\na myth.  See my Surnames, p. 197.]  has in its favour the fact that\r\nmany of our surnames are undoubtedly derived from characters assumed\r\nin dramatic performances and popular festivities.  To this class\r\nbelong many surnames which have the form of abstract nouns, e.g.\r\nCharity, Verity, Virtue, Vice.  Of similar origin are perhaps Bliss,\r\nChance, Luck, and Goodluck; cf. Bonaventure.  Love, Luff, occurs\r\ngenerally as a personal name, hence the dim. Lufkins, but it is\r\nsometimes a nickname.  Lovell, Lovett, more often mean little wolf.\r\nBoth Louvet and Louveau are common French surnames.  The name Lovell,\r\nin the wolf sense, was often applied to a dog, as in the famous\r\ncouplet\r\n\r\n\"The ratte, the catte, and Lovell, our dogge\r\n Rule all England under the hogge,\"\r\n\r\nfor which William Collingborne was executed in 1484.  Lowell is a\r\nvariant of Lovell.\r\n\r\nBut many apparent abstract names are due to folk-etymology, e.g.\r\nMarriage is local, Old Fr. marage, marsh, and Wedlock is imitative for\r\nWedlake; cf. Mortlock for Mortlake and perhaps Diplock for deep-lake.\r\nCreed is the Anglo-Saxon personal name Creda.  Revel, a common French\r\nsurname, is a personal name of obscure origin.  Want is the Mid. Eng.\r\nwont, mole, whence Wontner, mole-catcher.  It is difficult to see how\r\nsuch names as Warr, Battle, and Conquest came into existence.  The\r\nformer, found as de la warre, is no doubt sometimes local (Chapter\r\nXIII), and Battle is a dim. of Bat (Chapter VI).  But de la batayle is\r\nalso a common entry, and Laguerre and Labataille are common French\r\nsurnames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTUME\r\n\r\nA nickname was often conferred in connection with some external object\r\nregularly associated with the individual.  Names taken from shop-signs\r\nreally belong to this class.  Corresponding to our Hood  [Footnote:\r\nHood may also be for Hud (Chapter I), but the garment is made into a\r\npersonal name in Little Red Ridinghood, who is called in French le\r\npetit Chaperon Rouge.]  we have Fr. Capron (chaperon).  Burdon, Fr.\r\nbourdon, meant a staff, especially a pilgrim's staff.  Daunger is\r\ndescribed as having--\r\n\r\n\"In his honde a gret burdoun\"\r\n\r\n(Romaunt of the Rose, 3401).\r\n\r\nBut the name Burdon is also local.  Bracegirdle, i.e. breeks-girdle,\r\nmust have been the nickname of one who wore a gorgeous belt.  It is a\r\ncurious fact that this name is chiefly found in the same region\r\n(Cheshire) as the somewhat similar Broadbelt.  The Sussex name Quaile\r\nrepresents the Norman pronunciation of coif.  More usually an\r\nadjective enters into such combinations.  With the historic Curthose,\r\nLongsword, Strongbow we may compare Shorthouse, a perversion of\r\nshorthose, Longstaff, Horlock (hoar), Silverlock, Whitlock, etc.\r\nWhitehouse is usually of local origin, but has also absorbed the\r\nmedieval names Whitehose and White-hawse, the latter from Mid. Eng.\r\nhawse, neck.  Woollard may be the Anglo-Saxon personal name Wulfweard,\r\nbut is more probably from woolward, i.e. without linen, a costume\r\nassumed as a sign of penitence\r\n\r\n\"Wolwarde, without any lynnen nexte ones body, sans chemyse.\"\r\n(Palsgrave.)\r\n\r\nThe three names Medley, Medlicott, and Motley go together, though all\r\nthree of them may be local (the mid-lea, the middle-cot, and the\r\nmoat-lea).  Medley mixed, is the Anglo-French past participle of Old\r\nFr. mesler (mêler).  Motley is of unknown origin, but it was not\r\nnecessarily a fool's dress--\r\n\r\n\"A marchant was ther with a forked berd,\r\n In mottelye, and hye on horse he sat,\r\n Upon his heed a Flaundryssh bevere hat\" (A, 270).\r\n\r\nSo also the Serjeant of the Law was distinguished his, for the period,\r\nplain dress--\r\n\r\n\"He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote\" (A, 328).\r\n\r\nGildersleeve is now rare in England, though it still flourishes in the\r\nUnited States.  [Footnote: We have several instances of this\r\nphenomenon.  A familiar example is Lippincott, a surname of local\r\norigin (Devonshire).  But Bardsley's inclusion of American statistics\r\nis often misleading.  It is a well-known fact that the foreign names\r\nof immigrants are regularly assimilated to English forms in the United\r\nStates.  In some cases, such as Cook for Koch, Cope (Chapter XII) for\r\nKopf, Stout (Chapter XXII) for Stolz or Stultz, the change is\r\netymologically justified.  But in other cases, such as Tallman for\r\nThalmann, dale-man, Trout for Traut, faithful, the resemblance is\r\naccidental.  Beam and Chestnut, common in the States but very rare in\r\nEngland, represent an imitative form of Böhm or Behm, Bohemian, and a\r\ntranslation of Kestenbaum, chestnut tree, both Jewish names.  The\r\nBecks and Bowmans of New York outnumber those of London by about five\r\nto one, the first being for Beck, baker (Chapter XV), and the second\r\nfor Baumann, equivalent to Bauer, farmer.  Bardsley explains the\r\ncommon American name Arrison by the fact that there are Cockneys in\r\nAmerica.  It comes of course from Arend, a Dutch name related to\r\nArnold.\r\n\r\n\"A remarkable record in changes of surname was cited some years ago by\r\nan American correspondent of Notes and Queries.  'The changes which\r\nbefell a resident of New Orleans were that when he moved from an\r\nAmerican quarter to a German neighbourhood his name of Flint became\r\nFeuerstein, which for convenience was shortened to Stein.  Upon his\r\nremoval to a French district he was re-christened Pierre.  Hence upon\r\nhis return to an English neighbourhood he was translated into Peters,\r\nand his first neighbours were surprised and puzzled to find Flint\r\nturned Peters.'\"\r\n\r\n(Daily Chronicle, April 4, 1913.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nNames like Beard, Chinn, Tooth were conferred because of some\r\nprominent feature.  In Anglo-French we find Gernon, moustache, now\r\ncorrupted to Garnham, and also al gernon, with the moustache, which\r\nhas become Algernon.  But we have already seen (Chapter XIII) that\r\nsome names which appear to belong to this class are of local origin.\r\nSo also Tongue is derived from one of several places named Tong or\r\nTonge, though the ultimate origin is perhaps in some cases the same, a\r\n\"tongue\" of land.  Quartermain is for Quatre-mains, perhaps bestowed\r\non a very acquisitive person; Joscius Quatre-buches, four mouths, and\r\nRoger Tunekes, two necks, were alive in the twelfth century; and there\r\nis record of a Saracen champion named Quinze-paumes, though this is\r\nperhaps rather a measure of height.  Cheek I conjecture to be for\r\nChick.  The odd-looking Kidney is apparently Irish.  There is a rare\r\nname Poindexter, appearing in French as Poingdestre, \"right fist.\"\r\n[Footnote: President Poincaré's name appears to mean \"square fist.\"]\r\nI have seen it explained as from the heraldic term point dexter, but\r\nit is rather to be taken literally.  I find Johannes cum pugno in\r\n1184, and we can imagine that such a name may have been conferred on a\r\nmedieval bruiser.  There is also the possibility, considering the\r\nbrutality of many old nicknames, that the bearer of the name had been\r\njudicially deprived of his right hand, a very common punishment,\r\nespecially for striking a feudal superior.  Thus Renaut de Montauban,\r\nfinding that his unknown opponent is Charlemagne, exclaims--\r\n\r\n\"J'ai forfait le poing destre dont je l'ai adesé (struck).\"\r\n\r\nWe have some nicknames describing gait, e.g. Ambler and Shaylor--\r\n\r\n\"I shayle, as a man or horse dothe that gothe croked with his leggs,\r\nje vas eschays\" (Palsgrave)--\r\n\r\nand perhaps sometimes Trotter.  If George Eliot had been a student of\r\nsurnames she would hardly have named a heroine Nancy Lammiter, i.e.\r\ncripple--\r\n\r\n\"Though ye may think him a lamiter, yet, grippie for grippie, he'll\r\nmake the bluid spin frae under your nails\" (Black Dwarf, ch. xvii.).\r\n\r\nPettigrew and Pettifer are of French origin, pied de grue (crane) and\r\npied de fer.  The former is the origin of the word pedigree, from a\r\nsign used in drawing genealogical trees.  The Buckinghamshire name\r\nPuddifoot or Puddephatt (Podefat, 1273) and the aristocratic\r\nPauncefote are unsolved.  The former may be a corruption of Pettifer,\r\nwhich occurs commonly, along with the intermediate Puddifer, in the\r\nsame county.  But the English Dialect Dictionary gives as an obsolete\r\nNorthants word the adjective puddy, stumpy, pudgy, applied especially\r\nto hands, fingers, etc., and Pudito (puddy toe) occurs as a surname in\r\nthe Hundred Rolls.  As for Pauncefote, I believe it simply means what\r\nit appears to, viz. \"belly-foot,\" a curious formation, though not\r\nwithout parallels, among obsolete rustic nicknames.  If these two\r\nconjectures are correct, both Puddifoot and Pauncefote may be almost\r\nliteral equivalents of the Greek OEdipus, i.e. \"swell-foot.\"\r\n\r\nIn other languages as well as English we find money nicknames.  It is\r\neasy to understand how some of these come into existence, e.g. that\r\nPierce.  Pennilesse was the opposite of Thomas Thousandpound, whose\r\nname occurs c. 1300.  With the latter we may compare Fr. Centlivre,\r\nthe name of an English lady dramatist of the eighteenth century.\r\nMoneypenny is found in 1273 as Manipeni, and a Londoner named Manypeny\r\ndied in 1348.  The Money- is partly north country, partly imitative.\r\n\r\nMoney itself is usually occupative or local (Chapter XVII), and\r\nShilling is the Anglo-Saxon name Scilling.  The oldest and commonest\r\nof such nicknames is the simple Penny, with which we may compare the\r\nGerman surname Pfennig and its compounds Barpfennig, Weisspfennig,\r\netc.  The early adoption of this coin-name as a personal name is due\r\nto the fact that the word was taken in the sense of money in general.\r\nWe still speak of a rich man as \"worth a pretty penny.\" Hallmark is\r\nfolk-etymology for the medieval Half-mark.  Such medieval names as\r\nFour-pence, Twenty-mark, etc., probably now obsolete, are paralleled\r\nby Fr. Quatresous and Sixdenier, still to be found in the Paris\r\nDirectory.  It would be easy to form conjectures as to the various\r\nways in which such names may have come into existence.  To the same\r\nclass must belong Besant, the name of a coin from Byzantium, its\r\nforeign origin giving it a dignity which is absent from the native\r\nFarthing and Halfpenny, though the latter, in one instance, was\r\nimproved beyond recognition into MacAlpine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRECATIONS\r\n\r\nThere is also a small group of surnames derived from oaths or\r\nexclamations which by habitual use became associated with certain\r\nindividuals.  We know that monarchs had a special tendency to indulge\r\nin a favourite expletive.  To Roger de Collerye we owe some\r\ninformation as to the imprecations preferred by four French kings--\r\n\r\n\"Quand la Pasque-Dieu (Louis XI.) décéda,\r\n Le Bon Jour Dieu (Charles VIII.) luy succéda,\r\n Au Bon Jour Dieu deffunct et mort\r\n Succéda le Dyable m'emport (Louis XII).\r\n Luy décédé, nous voyons comme\r\n Nous duist (governs) la Foy de Gentilhomme (Francis I.).\"\r\n\r\nSo important was this branch of linguistics once considered that\r\nPalsgrave, the French tutor of Princess Mary Tudor, includes in his\r\nEsclarcissement de la Langue Francoyse a section on \"The Maners of\r\nCursyng.\" Among the examples are \"Le grant diable luy rompe le col et\r\nles deux jambes,\" \"Le diable l'emporte, corps et ame, tripes et\r\nboyaux,\" which were unfortunately too long for surname purposes, but\r\nan abridged form of \"Le feu Saint Anthoyne l'arde\" [Footnote: Saint\r\nAnthony's fire, i.e. erysipelas, burn him!] has given the French name\r\nFeulard.  Such names, usually containing the name of God, e.g.\r\nGodmefetch, Helpusgod, have mostly disappeared in this country; but\r\nDieuleveut and Dieumegard are still found in Paris, and Gottbehüt, God\r\nforbid, and Gotthelf, God help, occur in German.  Godbehere still\r\nexists, and there is not the slightest reason why it should not be of\r\nthe origin which its form indicates.  In Gracedieu, thanks to God, the\r\nsecond element is an Old French dative.  Pardoe, Purdue, whence\r\nPurdey, is for par Dieu--\r\n\r\n\"I have a wyf pardee, as wel as thow\" (A, 3158).\r\n\r\nThere is a well-known professional footballer named Mordue ('sdeath),\r\nand a French composer named Boieldieu (God's bowels).  The French\r\nnickname for an Englishman, goddam--\r\n\r\n\"Those syllables intense,\r\n Nucleus of England's native eloquence\"\r\n\r\n(Byron, The Island, iii. 5)--\r\n\r\ngoes back to the fifteenth century, in which invective references to\r\nthe godons are numerous.  [Footnote: \"Les Anglais en vérité ajoutent\r\npar-ci, par-là quelques autres mots en conversant; mais il est bien\r\naisé de voir que goddam est le fond de la langue\" (Beaumarchais,\r\nMariage de Figaro, iii.  5).]\r\n\r\nSuch nicknames are still in common use in some parts of France--\r\n\r\n\"Les Berrichons se désignent souvent par le juron qui leur est\r\nfamilier.  Ainsi ils diront: 'Diable me brûle est bien malade.  Nom\r\nd'un rat est à la foire.  La femme à Diable m'estrangouille est morte.\r\nLe garçon à Bon You (Dieu) se marie avec la fille à Dieu me confonde.'\"\r\n\r\n(Nyrop, Grammaire historique de la langue française, iv. 209).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHRASE-NAMES\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting group of nicknames is that of which we\r\nmay take Shakespeare as the type.  Incidentally we should be thankful\r\nthat our greatest poet bore a name so much more picturesque than\r\nCorneille, crow, or Racine, root.  It is agreed among all competent\r\nscholars that in compounds of this formation the verb was originally\r\nan imperative.  This is shown by the form; cf. ne'er-do-well, Fr.\r\nvaurien, Ger. Taugenichts, good-for-naught.  Thus Hasluck cannot\r\nbelong to this class, but must be an imitative form of the personal\r\nname Aslac, which we find in Aslockton.\r\n\r\nAs Bardsley well says, it is impossible to retail all the nonsense\r\nthat has been written about the name Shakespeare--\"never a name in\r\nEnglish nomenclature so simple or so certain in its origin; it is\r\nexactly what it looks--shake-spear.\"  The equivalent Schüttespeer is\r\nfound in German, and we have also in English Shakeshaft, Waghorn,\r\nWagstaff, Breakspear, Winspear.  \"Winship the mariner\" was a freeman\r\nof York in the fourteenth century.  Cf. Benbow (bend-bow), Hurlbatt,\r\nand the less athletic Lovejoy, Makepeace.  Gathergood and its opposite\r\nScattergood are of similar origin, good having here the sense of\r\ngoods.  Dogood is sometimes for Toogood, and the latter may be, like\r\nThoroughgood, an imitative form of Thurgod (Chapter VII); but both\r\nnames may also be taken literally, for we find Ger. Thunichtgut, do no\r\ngood, and Fr. Trodoux (trop doux).\r\n\r\nAs a pendant to Dolittle we find a medieval Hack-little, no doubt a\r\nlazy wood-cutter, while virtue is represented by a twelfth-century\r\nTire-little.  Sherwin represents the medieval Schere-wynd, applied to\r\na swift runner; cf. Ger. Schneidewind, cut wind, and Fr. Tranchevent.\r\nA nurseryman at Highgate has the appropriate name Cutbush, the French\r\nequivalent of which, Taillebois, has given us Tallboys; and a famous\r\nherbalist was named Culpepper.  In Gathercole the second element may\r\nmean cabbage or charcoal.  In one case, Horniblow for horn-blow, the\r\nverb comes after its object.\r\n\r\nNames of this formation are very common in Mid. English as in Old\r\nFrench, and often bear witness to a violent or brutal nature.  Thus\r\nScorch-beef, which is found in the Hundred Rolls, has no connection\r\nwith careless cookery; it is Old Fr. escorche (écorche) -buef, flay\r\nox, a name given to some medieval \"Skin-the-goat.\"  Catchpole (Chapter\r\nXX) is formed in the same way, and in French we find, applied to law\r\nofficials, the surnames Baillehart, give halter, [Footnote: Bailler,\r\nthe usual Old French for to give, is still used colloquially and in\r\ndialect.]  and Baillehache, give axe, the latter still appropriately\r\nborne, as Bailhache, by an English judge.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been assumed that most names of this class are due to\r\nfolk-etymology.  The frequency of their occurrence in Mid. English and\r\nin continental languages makes it certain that the contrary is the\r\ncase and that many surnames of obscure origin are perversions of this\r\nvery large and popular class.  I have seen it stated somewhere that\r\nShakespeare is a corruption of an Old French name Sacquespée,\r\n[Footnote: Of common occurrence in Mid. English records.]  the\r\ntheorist being apparently unable to see that this latter, meaning\r\ndraw-sword, is merely an additional argument, if such were needed, for\r\nthe literal interpretation of the English name.  [Footnote: In one\r\nday's reading I came across the following Mid. English names:\r\nBaillebien (give good), Baysedame (kiss lady), Esveillechien (wake\r\ndog), Lievelance (raise lance), Metlefrein (put the bridle),\r\nTracepurcel (track hog), Turnecotel (turn coat), together with the\r\nnative Cachehare and Hoppeschort.]\r\n\r\nTredgold seems to have been conferred on some medieval stoic, for we\r\nfind also Spurnegold.  Without pinning our faith to any particular\r\nanecdote, we need have no hesitation in accepting Turnbull as a\r\nsobriquet conferred for some feat of strength and daring on a stalwart\r\nBorderer.  We find the corresponding Tornebeuf in Old French, and\r\nTurnbuck also occurs.  Trumbull and Trumble are variants due to\r\nmetathesis followed by assimilation (Chapter III), while Tremble is a\r\nvery degenerate form.  In Knatchbull we have the obsolete verb knatch,\r\nwhich in Mid. English meant to strike on the head, fell.  Crawcour is\r\nFr. Crèvecoeur, breakheart, which has also become a local name in\r\nFrance.  With Shacklock, shake-lock, and Sherlock, Shurlock,\r\nshear-lock, we may compare Robin Hood's comrade Scathelock, though the\r\nprecise interpretation of all three names is difficult.  Rackstraw,\r\nrake-straw, corresponds to Fr. Grattepaille.  Golightly means much the\r\nsame as Lightfoot (Chapter XIII), nor need we hesitate to regard the\r\nJohn Gotobed  who lived in Cambridgeshire in 1273 as a notorious\r\nsluggard compared with whom his neighbour Serl Gotokirke was a shining\r\nexample.  [Footnote: The name is still found in the same county.\r\nUndergraduates contemporary with the author occasionally slaked their\r\nthirst at a riverside inn kept by Bathsheba Gotobed.]\r\n\r\nTelfer is Fr. Taillefer, the iron cleaver, and Henry II.'s yacht\r\ncaptain was Alan Trenchemer, the sea cleaver.  He had a contemporary\r\nnamed Ventados, wind abaft.\r\n\r\nSlocomb has assumed a local aspect, but may very well correspond to\r\nFr. Tardif or Ger. Mühsam, applied to some Weary Willie of the Middle\r\nAges.  Doubtfire is a misspelling of Dout-fire, from the dialect dout,\r\nto extinguish (do out), formed like don and doff.  Fullalove, which\r\ndoes not belong to the same formation, is also found as Plein d'amour--\r\n\r\n\"Of Sir Lybeux and Pleyndamour\" (B, 2090)--\r\n\r\nand corresponds to Ger. Liebevoll.  Waddilove actually occurs in the\r\nHundred Rolls as Wade-in-love, presumably a nickname conferred on some\r\nmedieval Don Juan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\nThere is one curious little group of nicknames which seem to\r\ncorrespond to such Latin names as Piso, from pisum, a pea, and Cicero,\r\nfrom cicer--\r\n\r\n\"Cicer, a small pulse, lesse than pease\" (Cooper).\r\n\r\nSuch are Barleycorn and Peppercorn, the former found in French as\r\nGraindorge.  The rather romantic names Avenel and Peverel seem to be\r\nof similar formation, from Lat. avena, oats, and piper, pepper.  In\r\nfact Peverel is found in Domesday as Piperellus, and Pepperell still\r\nexists.  With these may be mentioned Carbonel, corresponding to the\r\nFrench surname Charbonneau, a little coal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. ADJECTIVAL NICKNAMES\r\n\r\n\"The man replied that he did not know the object of the building; and\r\nto make it quite manifest that he really did not know, he put an\r\nadjective before the word 'object,' and another--that is, the\r\nsame--before the word 'building.' With that he passed on his way, and\r\nLord Jocelyn was left marvelling at the slender resources of our\r\nlanguage, which makes one adjective do duty for so many\r\nqualifications.\"\r\n\r\n(BESANT, All Sorts and Conditions of Men, ch. xxxviii.)\r\n\r\nThe rejection by the British workman of all adjectives but one is due\r\nto the same imaginative poverty which makes the adjective \"nice\"\r\nsupreme in refined circles, and which limits the schoolgirl to\r\n\"ripping\" and her more self-conscious brother to the tempered\r\n\"decent.\" But dozens of useful adjectives, now either obsolete or\r\nbanished to rustic dialect, are found among our surnames.  The\r\ntendency to accompany every noun by an adjective seems to belong to\r\nsome deep-rooted human instinct.  To this is partly due the Protean\r\ncharacter of this part of speech, for the word, like the coin, becomes\r\ndulled and worn in circulation and needs periodically to be withdrawn\r\nand replaced.  An epithet which is complimentary in one generation is\r\nironical in the next and eventually offensive.  Moody, with its\r\nnorthern form Mudie, which now means morose, was once valiant (Chapter\r\nI); and pert, surviving in the name Peart, meant active, brisk, etc.--\r\n\r\n\"Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.\"\r\n\r\n(Midsummer Night's Dream, i. 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHAIC MEANINGS\r\n\r\nTo interpret an adjectival nickname we must go to its meaning in\r\nChaucer and his contemporaries.  Silly, Seeley, Seely\r\n\r\n\"This sely, innocent Custance\" (B, 682)--\r\n\r\nstill means innocent when we speak of the \"silly sheep,\" and happy in\r\nthe phrase \"silly Suffolk.\" It is cognate with Ger. selig, blessed,\r\noften used in speaking of the dead.  We have compounds in Sillilant,\r\nsimple child (Chapter X), and Selibarn.  Seely was also used for Cecil\r\nor Cecilia.  Sadd was once sedate and steadfast\r\n\r\n\"But thogh this mayde tendre were of age,\r\n Yet in the brest of hire virginitee\r\n Ther was enclosed rype and sad corage\"\r\n\r\n(E, 218);\r\n\r\nand as late as 1660 we find a book in defence of Charles I. described\r\nas--\r\n\r\n\"A sad and impartial inquiry whether the King or Parliament began the\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\nStout, valiant, now used euphemistically for fat, is cognate with Ger.\r\nstolz, proud, and possibly with Lat. stultus, foolish.  The three\r\nideas are not incompatible, for fools are notoriously proud of their\r\nfolly and are said to be less subject to fear than the angels.\r\nSturdy, Sturdee, once meant rebellious, pig-headed--\r\n\r\n\"Sturdy, unbuxum, rebellis, contumax, inobediens.\"  (Prompt.  Parv.)\r\n\r\nCotgrave offers a much wider choice for the French original--\r\n\r\n\"Estourdi (étourdi), dulled, amazed, astonished, dizzie-headed, or\r\nwhose head seemes very much troubled; (hence) also, heedlesse,\r\ninconsiderate, unadvised, witlesse, uncircumspect, rash, retchlesse,\r\nor carelesse; and sottish, blockish, lumpish, lusk-like, without life,\r\nmetall, spirit\"\r\n\r\nSly and its variant Sleigh have degenerated in the same way as crafty\r\nand cunning, both of which once meant skilled.  Chaucer calls the\r\nwings of Daedalus \"his playes slye,\" i.e. his ingenious contrivances.\r\nQuick meant alert, lively, as in \"the quick and the dead.\" Slight,\r\ncognate with Ger. schlecht, bad, once meant plain or simple.\r\n\r\nMany adjectives which are quite obsolete in literary English survive\r\nas surnames.  Mid. Eng. Lyle has been supplanted by its derivative\r\nLittle, the opposite pair surviving as Mutch and Mickle.  The poor\r\nparson did not fail--\r\n\r\n\"In siknesse nor in meschief to visite\r\n The ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lyte.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 493.)\r\n\r\nWe have for Lyte also the imitative Light; cf. Lightwood.  With Little\r\nmay be mentioned Murch, an obsolete word for dwarf--\r\n\r\n\"Murch, lytyl man, nanus.\"\r\n\r\n(Prompt.  Parv.)\r\n\r\nLenain is a fairly common name in France.  Snell, swift or valiant,\r\nhad become a personal name in Anglo-Saxon, but we find le snel in the\r\nMiddle Ages.  Freake, Frick, also meant valiant or warrior--\r\n\r\n\"Ther was no freke that ther wolde flye\"\r\n\r\n(Chevy Chase);\r\n\r\nbut the Promptorium Parvulorum makes it equivalent to Craske (Chapter\r\nXXII)--\r\n\r\n\"Fryke, or craske, in grete helth, crassus.\"\r\n\r\nIt is cognate with Ger. frech, which now means impudent.  Nott has\r\nalready been mentioned (Chapter II).  Of the Yeoman we are told--\r\n\r\n\"A not hed hadde he, with a broun visage.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 109.)\r\n\r\nStark, cognate with starch, now usually means stiff, rather than\r\nstrong--\r\n\r\n\"I feele my lymes stark and suffisaunt\r\n To do al that a man bilongeth to.\"\r\n\r\n(E, 1458.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISGUISED SPELLINGS\r\n\r\nBut Stark is also for an earlier Sterk (cf. Clark and Clerk), which\r\nrepresents Mid. Eng. stirk, a heifer.  In the cow with the crumpled\r\nhorn we have a derivative of Mid. Eng. crum, crooked, whence the names\r\nCrum and Crump.  Ludwig's German Dict. (1715) explains krumm as\r\n\"crump, crooked, wry.\" The name Crook generally has the same meaning,\r\nthe Ger. Krummbein corresponding to our Cruikshank or Crookshanks.  It\r\nis possible that Glegg and Gleig are Mid. Eng. gleg, skilful, of\r\nScand. origin.\r\n\r\nThere are some adjectival surnames which are not immediately\r\nrecognizable.  Bolt, when not local (Chapter XIII) is for bold, Leaf\r\nis imitative for lief, i.e. dear.  Dear itself is of course hopelessly\r\nmixed up with Deer...  The timorous-looking Fear is Fr. le fier, the\r\nproud or fierce.  Skey is an old form of shy; Bligh is for Blyth;\r\nHendy and Henty are related to handy, and had in Mid. English the\r\nsense of helpful, courteous--\r\n\r\n\"Oure hoost tho spak, 'A, sire, ye sholde be hende\r\n And curteys, as a man of youre estat.'\"\r\n\r\n(D, 1286.)\r\n\r\nFor Savage we find also the archaic spelling Salvage (Lat.\r\nsilvaticus).  Curtis is Norman Fr. curteis (courtois).  The adjective\r\ngarish, now only poetical, but once commonly applied to gaudiness in\r\ndress, has given Gerrish.  Quaint, which has so many meanings\r\nintermediate between its etymological sense of known or familiar (Lat.\r\ncognitus) and its present sense of unusual or unfamiliar, survives as\r\nQuint.  But Coy is usually local, from Quy (Cambridgeshire).\r\n\r\nOrpwood is a corruption of Mid. Eng. orped, bold, warlike.  Craske is\r\nan East Anglian word for fat, and Crouse is used in the north for\r\nsprightly, confident.  To these we may add Ketch, Kedge, Gedge, from\r\nan East Anglian adjective meaning lively--\r\n\r\n\"Kygge, or joly, jocundus\" (Prompt.  Parv.)--\r\n\r\nand Spragg, etymologically akin to Spry.  Bragg was once used for bold\r\nor brave, without any uncomplimentary suggestion.  The New English\r\nDictionary quotes (c. 1310) from a lyric poem--\r\n\r\n\"That maketh us so brag and bolde\r\n And biddeth us ben blythe.\"\r\n\r\nCrease is a West-country word for squeamish, but the East Anglian name\r\nCreasey, Cressy, is usually for the local Kersey (Suffolk).  The only\r\nsolution of Pratt is that it is Anglo-Sax. praett, cunning, adopted\r\nearly as a personal name, while Storr, of Scandinavian origin, means\r\nbig, strong.  It is cognate with Steer, a bull.  Devey and Dombey seem\r\nto be diminutive forms of deaf and dumb, still used in dialect in\r\nreference to persons thus afflicted.  We find in French and German\r\nsurnames corresponding to these very natural nicknames.  Cf. Crombie\r\nfrom Crum (Chapter XXII).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH ADJECTIVES\r\n\r\nA large proportion of our adjectival nicknames are of French origin.\r\nLe bel appears not only as Bell but also, through Picard, as Beal.\r\nOther examples are Boon, Bone, Bunn (bon), Grant (grand), Bass (bas)\r\nand its derivative Bassett, Dasent (décent), Follett and Folliott,\r\ndim. of fol (fou), mad, which also appears in the compound Foljambe,\r\nFulljames.\r\n\r\nMordaunt means biting.  Power is generally Anglo-Fr. le poure (le\r\npauvre) and Grace is for le gras, the fat.  Jolige represents the Old\r\nFrench form of joli--\r\n\r\n\"This Absolon, that jolif was and gay,\r\n Gooth with a sencer (censer) on the haliday.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 3339.)\r\n\r\nPrynne, now Pring, is Anglo-Fr. le prin, the first, from the Old\r\nFrench adjective which survives in printemps.  Cf. our name Prime and\r\nthe French name Premier.  The Old French adjective Gent, now replaced\r\nby gentil, generally means slender in Mid. English--\r\n\r\n\"Fair was this yonge wyf, and therwithal\r\n As any wezele hir body gent and smal.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 3233)\r\n\r\nPetty and Pettit are variant forms of Fr. petit, small.  In Prowse and\r\nProut we have the nominative and objective (Chapter I) of an Old\r\nFrench adjective now represented by preux and prude, generally thought\r\nto be related in some way to Lat. pro in prosum, and perhaps also the\r\nsource of our Proud.\r\n\r\nGross is of course Fr. le gros, but Grote represents Du. groot, great,\r\nprobably unconnected with the French word.  The Devonshire name\r\nCoffin, which is found in that county in the twelfth century, is the\r\nsame as Caffyn, perhaps representing Fr. Chauvin, bald, the name of\r\nthe theologian whom we know better in the latinized form Calvin.  Here\r\nbelongs probably Shovel, Fr. Chauvel.  We also have the simple Chaffe,\r\nOld Fr. chauf (chauve), bald.  Gaylard, sometimes made into the\r\nimitative Gaylord, is Fr. gaillard, brisk, lively\r\n\r\n\"Gaillard he was as goldfynch in the shawe.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 4367.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOUR NAMES\r\n\r\nEspecially common are colour nicknames, generally due to the\r\ncomplexion, but sometimes to the garb.  As we have already seen\r\n(Chapter XV), Black and its variant Blake sometimes mean pale.  Blagg\r\nis the same word; cf. Jagg for Jack.  White has no doubt been\r\nreinforced by wight, valiant\r\n\r\n\"Oh for one hour of Wallace wight\r\n Or well-skilled Bruce to rule the fight.\"\r\n\r\n(Marmion, vi.  20.)\r\n\r\nAs an epithet applied to the hair we often find Hoar; cf. Horlock.\r\nRedd is rare, the usual forms being the northern Reid, Reed, Read; but\r\nwe also have Rudd from Anglo-Sax. rud, whence ruddy and the name\r\nRuddock, really a bird nickname, the redbreast.  To these must be\r\nadded Rudge, Fr. rouge, Rouse, Rush and Russ, Fr, roux, and Russell or\r\nRowsell, Old Fr. roussel (Rousseau).  The commonest nickname for a\r\nfair-haired person was Blunt, Blount, Fr. blond, with its dim.\r\nBlundell, but the true English name is Fairfax, from Anglo-Sax. feax,\r\nhair.  The New English Dictionary quotes from the fifteenth century\r\n\r\n\"Then they lowsyd hur feyre faxe,\r\n That was yelowe as the waxe.\"\r\n\r\nThe adjective dun was once a regular name, like Dobbin or Dapple, for\r\na cart-horse; hence the name of the old rural sport \"Dun in the mire\"--\r\n\r\n\"If thou art dun we'll draw thee from the mire.\" (Romeo and Juliet, i.\r\n4.)\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the name Dunn is sometimes due to this specific\r\napplication of the word.  The colour blue appears as Blew--\r\n\r\n\"At last he rose, and twitch'd his mantle blew:\r\n To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new\"\r\n\r\n(Lycidas, 1.  192)--\r\n\r\nand earlier still as Blow--\r\n\r\n\"Blak, blo, grenysh, swartysh, reed.\"\r\n\r\n(House of Fame, iii.  557.)\r\n\r\nOther colour names of French origin are Morel, swarthy, like a Moor,\r\nalso found as Murrell [Footnote: This, like Merrill, is sometimes from\r\nMuriel.]; and Burnell, Burnett, dims.  of brun, brown.  Chaucer speaks\r\nof--\r\n\r\n\"Daun Burnet the asse\" (B, 4502);\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Lat. dominus; the masculine form of dame in Old French.]\r\n\r\n\"Daun Russel the fox\" (B, 4524.)\r\n\r\nBut both Burnell and Burnett may also be local from places ending in\r\n-hill and -head (), and Burnett is sometimes for Burnard.  The same\r\napplies to Burrell, usually taken to be from Mid. Eng. borel, a rough\r\nmaterial, Old Fr. burel (bureau), also used metaphorically in the\r\nsense of plain, uneducated\r\n\r\n\"And moore we seen of Cristes secree thynges\r\n Than burel folk, al though they weren kynges.\"\r\n\r\n(D, 1871.)\r\n\r\nThe name can equally well be the local Burhill or Burwell.\r\n\r\nMurray is too common to be referred entirely to the Scottish name and\r\nis sometimes for murrey, dark red (Fr. mûre, mulberry).  It may also\r\nrepresent merry, in its variant form murie, which is Mid. English, and\r\nnot, as might appear, Amurrican--\r\n\r\n\"His murie men comanded he\r\n To make hym bothe game and glee.\"\r\n\r\n(B, 2029.)\r\n\r\nPook, of uncertain origin, is supposed to have been a dark russet\r\ncolour.  Bayard, a derivative of bay, was the name of several famous\r\nwar-horses.  Cf. Blank and Blanchard.  The name Soar is from the Old\r\nFrench adjective sor, bright yellow.  It is of Germanic origin and\r\ncognate with sere.\r\n\r\nThe dim. Sorrel may be a colour name, but it was applied in venery to\r\na buck in the third year, of course in reference to colour; and some\r\nof our names, e.g. Brocket and Prickett, [Footnote: Both words are\r\nconnected with the spiky young horns, Fr. broche, spit, being applied\r\nin venery to the pointed horns of the second year.]  both applied to a\r\ntwo-year-old stag, must sometimes be referred to this important\r\ndepartment of medieval language.  Holofernes uses some of these terms\r\nin his idiotic verses\r\n\r\n\"The preyful princess pierc'd and prick'd a pretty pleasing priket;\r\n Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made sore with shooting.\r\n The dogs did yell; put l to sore, then sorel jumps from thicket.\"\r\n\r\n(Love's Labour's Lost, iv. 2.)\r\n\r\nA few adjective nicknames of Celtic origin are so common in England\r\nthat they may be included here.  Such are the Welsh Gough, Goff,\r\nGooch, Gutch, red, Gwynn and Wynne, white, Lloyd, grey, Sayce, Saxon,\r\nforeigner, Vaughan, small, and the Gaelic Bain, Bean, white, Boyd,\r\nBowie, yellow-haired, Dow, Duff, black, Finn, fair, Glass, grey, Roy,\r\nRoe, red.  From Cornish come Coad, old, and Couch, [Footnote: Cognate\r\nwith Welsh Gough.]  red, while Bean is the Cornish for small, and\r\nTyacke means a farmer.  It is likely that both Begg and Moore owe\r\nsomething to the Gaelic adjectives for little and big, as in the\r\nwell-known names of Callum Beg, Edward Waverley's gillie, and McCallum\r\nMore.  The Gaelic Begg is cognate with the Welsh Vaughan.  Two other\r\nfamous Highland nicknames which are very familiar in England are\r\nCameron, crooked nose, and Campbell, wry mouth.  With these may be\r\nmentioned the Irish Kennedy, ugly head, the name of the father of\r\nBrian Boru.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. BIRDS, BEASTS, AND FISHES\r\n\r\n\"As I think I have already said, one of Umslopogaas'\r\n Zulu names was The Woodpecker.\"\r\n\r\n(HAGGARD, Allan Quatermain, ch. vii.)\r\n\r\nThe great majority of nicknames coming under the headings typified by\r\nBird and Fowell, Best, and Fish or Fisk (Scand.) are easily\r\nidentified.  But here, as everywhere in the subject, pitfalls abound.\r\nThe name Best itself is an example of a now misleading spelling\r\nretained for obvious reasons--\r\n\r\n\"First, on the wal was peynted a forest,\r\n In which ther dwelleth neither man nor best.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 1976.)\r\n\r\nWe do not find exotic animals, nor even the beasts of heraldry, at all\r\nfrequently.  Leppard, leopard, is in some cases for the Ger. Liebhart;\r\nand Griffin, when not Welsh, should no doubt be included among\r\ninn-signs.  Oliphant, i.e. elephant--\r\n\r\n\"For maystow surmounten thise olifauntes in gretnesse or weighte of\r\nbody\" (Boece, 782)--\r\n\r\nmay be a genuine nickname, but Roland's ivory horn was also called by\r\nthis name, and the surname may go back to some legendary connection of\r\nthe same kind.  Bear is not uncommon, captive bears being familiar to\r\na period in which the title bear-ward is frequently met with.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Drake may sometimes represent Anglo-Sax. draca,\r\ndragon, rather than the bird, but the latter is unmistakable in\r\nSheldrick, for sheldrake.  As a rule, animal nicknames were taken\r\nrather from the domestic species with which the peasantry were\r\nfamiliar and whose habits would readily suggest comparisons, generally\r\ndisparaging, with those of their neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS\r\n\r\nBird names are especially common, and it does not need much\r\nimagination to see how readily and naturally a man might be nicknamed\r\nHawke for his fierceness, Crowe from a gloomy aspect, or Nightingale\r\nfor the gift of sweet song.  Many of these surnames go back to words\r\nwhich are now either obsolete or found only in dialect.  The peacock\r\nwas once the Poe, an early loan from Lat. pavo, or, more fully, Pocock\r\n\r\n\"A sheaf of pocok arwes, bright and kene,\r\n Under his belt he bar ful thriftily.\"\r\n\r\n(A, 104.)\r\n\r\nThe name Pay is another form of the same word.  Coe, whence Hedgecoe,\r\nis an old name for the jackdaw--\r\n\r\n\"Cadow, or coo, or chogh (chough), monedula\" (Prompt. Parv.)--\r\n\r\nbut may also stand for cow, as we find, in defiance of gender and sex,\r\nsuch entries as Robert le cow, William le vache.  Those birds which\r\nhave now assumed a font-name, such as Jack daw, Mag pie, of course\r\noccur without it as surnames, e.g. Daw and Pye--\r\n\r\n\"The thief the chough, and eek the jangelyng pye\" (Parliament of\r\nFowls, 305).\r\n\r\nThe latter has a dim. Pyatt.\r\n\r\nRainbird is a local name for the green woodpecker, but as an\r\nEast-Anglian name it is most likely an imitative form of Fr. Rimbaud\r\nor Raimbaud, identical with Anglo-Sax. Regenbeald.  Knott is the name\r\nof a bird which frequents the sea-shore and, mindful of Cnut's wisdom,\r\nretreats nimbly before the advancing surf--\r\n\r\n\"The knot that called was Canutus' bird of old.\"\r\n\r\n(Drayton, Polyolbion, xxv. 368.)\r\n\r\nThis historical connection is most probably due to folk-etymology.\r\nTitmus is of course for tit-mouse.  Dialect names for the woodpecker\r\nsurvive in Speight, Speke, and Spick, Pick (Chapter III).  The same\r\nbird was also called woodwall--\r\n\r\n\"In many places were nyghtyngales,\r\n Alpes, fynches, and wodewales\"\r\n\r\n(Romaunt of the Rose, 567)--\r\n\r\nhence, in some cases, the name Woodall.  The Alpe, or bullfinch,\r\nmentioned in the above lines, also survives as a surname.  Dunnock and\r\nPinnock are dialect names for the sparrow.  It was called in\r\nAnglo-Norman muisson, whence Musson.  Starling is a dim. of Mid. Eng.\r\nstare, which has itself given the surname Starr\r\n\r\n\"The stare, that the counseyl can be-wrye.\" (Parliament of Fowls,\r\n348.)\r\n\r\nHeron is the French form of the bird-name which was in English Herne--\r\n\r\n\"I come from haunts of coot and hern.\" (Tennyson, The Brook, 1.  1.)\r\n\r\nThe Old French dim. heronceau also passed into English--\r\n\r\n\"I wol nat tellen of hir strange sewes (courses),\r\n Ne of hir swannes, ne of hire heronsewes.\"\r\n\r\n(F, 67.)\r\n\r\nAs a surname it has been assimilated to the local, and partly\r\nidentical, Hearnshaw (Chapter XII).  Some commentators go to this word\r\nto explain Hamlet's use of handsaw--\r\n\r\n\"I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly,\r\n I know a hawk from a handsaw\" (Hamlet, ii.  2).\r\n\r\nWhen the author's father was a boy in Suffolk eighty years ago, the\r\nlocal name for the bird was pronounced exactly like answer.  Grew is\r\nFr. grue, crane, Lat. grus, gru-.  Butter, Fr. butor, \"a bittor\"\r\n(Cotgrave), is a dialect name for the bittern, called a \"butter-bump\"\r\nby Tennyson's Northern Farmer (1.  31).  Culver is Anglo-Sax. culfre,\r\na pigeon--\r\n\r\n\"Columba, a culver, a dove\"\r\n\r\n(Cooper)--\r\n\r\nhence the local Culverhouse.  Dove often becomes Duff.  Gaunt is\r\nsometimes a dialect form of gannet, used in Lincolnshire of the\r\ncrested grebe.  Popjoy may have been applied to the successful archer\r\nwho became king of the popinjay for the year.  The derivation of the\r\nword, Old Fr. papegai, whence Mid. Eng. papejay--\r\n\r\n\"The briddes synge, it is no nay,\r\n The sparhawk and the papejay,\r\nThat joye it was to heere\"\r\n\r\n(B, 1956)--\r\n\r\nis obscure, though various forms of it are found in most of the\r\nEuropean languages.  In English it was applied not only to the parrot,\r\nbut also to the green woodpecker.  The London Directory form is\r\nPobgee.\r\n\r\nWith bird nicknames may be mentioned Callow, unfledged, cognate with\r\nLat. calvus, bald.  Its opposite also survives as Fleck and Flick--\r\n\r\n\"Flygge, as byrdis, maturus, volabilis.\"\r\n\r\n(Prompt.  Parv.)\r\n\r\nMargaret Paston, writing (1460) of the revived hopes of Henry VI.,\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n\"Now he and alle his olde felawship put owt their fynnes, and arn\r\nryght flygge and mery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWK NAMES\r\n\r\nWe have naturally a set of names taken from the various species of\r\nfalcons.  To this class belongs Haggard, probably related to\r\nAnglo-Sax. haga, hedge, and used of a hawk which had acquired\r\nincurable habits of wildness by preying for itself.  But Haggard is\r\nalso a personal name (Chapter VIII).  Spark, earlier Sparhawk, is the\r\nsparrow-hawk.  It is found already in Anglo-Saxon as a personal name,\r\nand the full Sparrowhawk also exists.  Tassell is a corruption of\r\ntiercel, a name given to the male peregrine, so termed, according to\r\nthe legendary lore of venery--\r\n\r\n\"Because he is, commonly, a third part lesse than the female.\"\r\n(Cotgrave, )\r\n\r\nJuliet calls Romeo her \"tassell gentle\" (ii.  2).  Muskett was a name\r\ngiven to the male sparrow-hawk.\r\n\r\n\"Musket, a lytell hauke, mouchet.\"  (Palsgrave.)\r\n\r\nMushet is the same name.  It comes from Ital. moschetto, a little fly.\r\nFor its later application to a firearm cf. falconet.  Other names of\r\nthe hawk class are Buzzard and Puttock, i.e. kite--\r\n\r\n\"Milan, a kite, puttock, glead\"\r\n\r\n(Cotgrave);\r\n\r\nand to the same bird we owe the name Gleed, from a Scandinavian name\r\nfor the bird\r\n\r\n\"And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind.\" (Deut.\r\nxiv. 13.)\r\n\r\nTo this class also belongs Ramage--\r\n\r\n\"Ramage, of, or belonging to, branches; also, ramage, hagard, wild,\r\nhomely, rude\"\r\n\r\n(Cotgrave)--\r\n\r\nand sometimes Lennard, an imitative form of \"lanner,\" the name of an\r\ninferior hawk--\r\n\r\n\"Falcunculus, a leonard.\"\r\n\r\n(Holyoak, Lat. Dict., 1612.)\r\n\r\nPovey is a dialect name for the owl, a bird otherwise absent from the\r\nsurname list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEASTS\r\n\r\nAmong beast nicknames we find special attention given, as in modern\r\nvituperation, to the swine, although we do not find this true English\r\nword, unless it be occasionally disguised as Swain.  Hogg does not\r\nbelong exclusively to this class, as it is used in dialect both of a\r\nyoung sheep and a yearling colt.  Anglo-Sax. sugu, sow, survives in\r\nSugg.  Purcell is Old Fr. pourcel (pourceau), dim. of Lat. porcus, and\r\nI take Pockett to be a disguised form of the obsolete porket--\r\n\r\n\"Porculus, a pygg: a shoote: a porkes.\"\r\n\r\n(Cooper.)\r\n\r\nThe word shoote in the above gloss is now the dialect shot, a young\r\npig, which may have given the surname Shott.  But Scutt is from a Mid.\r\nEnglish adjective meaning short--\r\n\r\n\"Scute, or shorte, curtus, brevis\"\r\n\r\n(Prompt.  Parv.)--\r\n\r\nand is also an old name for the hare.  Two other names for the pig are\r\nthe northern Galt and the Lincolnshire Grice--\r\n\r\n\"Marcassin, a young wild boare; a shoot or grice.\" (Cotgrave.)\r\n\r\nGrice also represents le gris, the grey; cf. Grace for le gras\r\n(Chapter XXII).  Bacon looks like a nickname, but is invariably found\r\nwithout the article.  As it is common in French, it would appear to be\r\nan Old French accusative to Back, going back to Germanic Bacco\r\n(Chapter XIII).  Hinks is Mid. Eng. hengst, a stallion, and is thus\r\nidentical with Hengist (Chapter XX).  Stott means both a bullock and a\r\nnag (Chapter XIX).\r\n\r\nEveryone remembers Wamba's sage disquisition on the names of animals\r\nin the first chapter of Ivanhoe.  Like much of Scott's archaeology it\r\nis somewhat anachronistic, for the live animals were also called veals\r\nand muttons for centuries after Wamba's death\r\n\r\n\"Mouton, a mutton, a weather\"; \"veau, a calfe, or veale.\" (Cotgrave.)\r\n\r\nCalf has become very rare as a surname, though Kalb is still common in\r\nGermany.  Bardsley regards Duncalf and Metcalf as perverted from\r\ndun-croft and meadow-croft.  It seems possible that they may be for\r\ndown-calf and mead-calf, from the locality of the pasture, but this is\r\na pure guess on my part.  It is curious that beef does not appear to\r\nhave survived, though Leboeuf is common in French, and bullocks are\r\nstill called \"beeves\" in Scotland.  Tegg is still used by butchers for\r\na two-year-old sheep.  Palsgrave gives it another meaning--\r\n\r\n\"Tegg, or pricket (Chapter XXII), saillant.\"\r\n\r\nRoe is also found in the older forms Rae and Ray, of course confused\r\nwith Wray (Chapter XIII), as Roe itself is with Rowe (Chapter I).  Doe\r\noften becomes Dowe.  Hind is usually occupative (Chapter III), but Fr.\r\nLabiche suggests that it must sometimes be a nickname--\r\n\r\n\"Biche, a hind; the female of a stagge.\" (Cotgrave.)\r\n\r\nPollard was applied to a beast or stag that had lost its horns--\r\n\r\n\"He has no horns, sir, has he?\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, he's a pollard.\"\r\n\r\n(Beaumont and Fletcher, Philaster, v. 4.)\r\n\r\nLeverett is certified by the French surname Levrault.  Derivation from\r\nLever, Anglo-Sax. Leofhere, whence Levers, Leverson, or Leveson, is\r\nmuch less probable, as these Anglo-Saxon names rarely form dims.\r\n(Chapter VII).  Luttrel is in French Loutrel, perhaps a dim. of\r\nloutre, otter, Lat. lutra.  From the medieval lutrer or lutrarius,\r\notter hunter, we get Lutterer, no doubt confused with the musical\r\nLuter.\r\n\r\nWhile Catt is fairly common in the eastern counties, Robertus le chien\r\nand Willelmus le curre, who were living about the end of the twelfth\r\ncentury, are now completely disguised as Ken and Kerr.  Modern French\r\nhas both Lechien and the Norman Lequien.  [Footnote: Lekain, the name\r\nof a famous French actor, has the same origin.]  We owe a few other\r\nsurnames to the friend of man.  Kennett, from a Norman dim. of chien,\r\nmeant greyhound--\r\n\r\n\"Kenette, hounde, leporarius.\" (Prompt.  Parv.)\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name Talbot is unknown, and it is uncertain whether\r\nthe hound or the family should have precedence; but Chaucer seems to\r\nuse it as the proper name of a hound\r\n\r\n\"Ran Colle our dogge, and Talbot, and Gerland,\r\n And Malkyn, with a dystaf in hir hand.\"\r\n\r\n(B, 4573.)\r\n\r\nThe great Earl of Shrewsbury is affectionately called \"Talbot, our\r\ngood dogge\" in political rimes of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn early dictionaries may be found long lists of the fanciful names,\r\nsuch as Bright, Lightfoot, Ranger, Ringwood, Swift, Tempest, given to\r\nhounds.  This practice seems to throw some light on such surnames as\r\nTempest, with which we may compare the German names Storm and Sturm.\r\nIn the Pipe Rolls the name le esturmi, the stormy, occurs several\r\ntimes.  To the same class belongs Thunder, found in the Pipe Rolls as\r\nTonitruus, and not therefore necessarily a perversion of Tunder, i.e.\r\nSherman (Chapter XVIII)--\r\n\r\n\"Tondeur de draps, a shearman, or clothworker.\" (Cotgrave.)\r\n\r\nGarland, used by Chaucer as a dog's name, was earlier graland, and, as\r\nle garlaund is also found, it may be referred to Old Fr. grailler, to\r\ntrumpet.  It no doubt has other origins.\r\n\r\nWe should expect Fox to be strongly represented, and we find the\r\ncompounds Colfox and Stelfox.  The first means black fox--\r\n\r\n\"A colfox ful of sly iniquitee\"\r\n\r\n(B, 4405)--\r\n\r\nand I conjecture that the first part of Stelfox is connected with\r\nstealing, as in the medieval name Stele-cat--\r\n\r\n\"The two constables made a thorough search and found John Stelfox\r\nhiding behind some bushes.  Some of the jewellery was found upon him\"\r\n\r\n(Daily Chronicle, June 3, 1913).\r\n\r\nIn the north a fox is called Tod, whence Todhunter.  This Tod is\r\nprobably a personal name, like the French Renard and the Scottish\r\nLawrie or Lowrie, applied to the same animal.  Allan Ramsay calls him\r\n\"slee Tod Lowrie.\" From the badger we have Brock and sometimes Gray--\r\n\r\nBlaireau, a badger, gray, boason, brock (Cotgrave)--\r\n\r\nbut Badger itself is occupative (Chapter XIX).  The polecat survives\r\nas Fitch, Fitchett, and Fitchew--\r\n\r\n\"Fissau, a filch, or fulmart.\"\r\n\r\n(Cotgrave.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHES\r\n\r\nOn fish-names Bardsley remarks, \"We may quote the famous chapter on\r\n'Snakes in Iceland': 'There are no snakes in Iceland,' and say there\r\nare no fish-names in England.\" This is almost true.  The absence of\r\nmarked traits of character in the, usually invisible, fish would\r\nmilitate against the adoption of such names.  We should not expect to\r\nfind the shark to be represented, for the word is of too late\r\noccurrence.  But Whale is fairly common.  Whale the mariner received\r\ntwo pounds from Henry VII's privy purse in 1498.  The story of Jonah,\r\nor very generous proportions, may have originated the name Whalebelly,\r\n\"borne by a respectable family in south-east England\"  (Bardsley).\r\n\r\nBut there would obviously be no great temptation to go fishing for\r\nnicknames when the beasts of the farmyard and the forest, the birds of\r\nthe marshes and the air, offered on every side easily understood\r\ncomparisons.  At the same time Bardsley's statement goes a little too\r\nfar.  He explains Gudgeon as a corruption of Goodison.  But this, true\r\nthough it may be in some cases, will not explain the very common\r\nFrench surname Goujon.  The phrase \"greedy gudgeon\" suggests that in\r\nthis case a certain amount of character had been noticed in the fish.\r\nSturgeon also seems to be a genuine fish-name.  We find Fr. Lesturgeon\r\nand Ger. Stoer, both meaning the same.  We have also Smelt and the\r\nsynonymous Spurling.  In French and German we find other surnames\r\nwhich undoubtedly belong to this class, but they are not numerous and\r\nprobably at first occurred only in regions where fishing or\r\nfish-curing were important industries.\r\n\r\nA few examples will show that apparent fish-names are usually not\r\ngenuine.  Chubb is for Job (Chapter III), Eeles is one of the numerous\r\nderivatives of Elias (Chapter IX), Hake is, like Hack, from the\r\nScandinavian Hacun, Haddock is sometimes a perversion of the local\r\nHaydock, Lamprey comes via Old French from Old High Ger. Landprecht,\r\nwhich has usually given Lambert.\r\n\r\nPike is local (Chapter XII), Pilchard is for Pilcher (Chapter XVIII),\r\nRoach is Fr. Laroche, Salmon is for Salomon, and Turbot is the\r\nAnglo-Sax. Thurbeorht, which has also given Tarbut, as Thurgod has\r\ngiven Targett.  But in few of the above examples is the possibility of\r\nfish origin absolutely excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nWe have also many surnames due to physical resemblances not extending\r\nbeyond one feature.  Birdseye may be sometimes of local origin, from\r\ney, island (Chapter XII), but as a genuine nickname it is as natural\r\nas the sobriquet of Hawkeye which Natty Bumppo received from the\r\nHurons.  German has the much less pleasing Gansauge, goose-eye; and\r\nAlan Oil de larrun, thief's eye, was fined for very reprehensible\r\nconduct in 1183.  To explain Crowfoot as an imitative variant of\r\nCrawford is absurd when we find a dozen German surnames of the same\r\nclass and formation and as many in Old or Modern French beginning with\r\npied de.  Cf. Pettigrew (Chapter XXI) and Sheepshanks.  We find in the\r\nParis Directory not only Piedeleu (Old Fr. leu, wolf) and Piedoie\r\n(oie, goose), but even the full Pied-de-Lièvre, Professeur à la\r\nFaculté de droit.  The name Bulleid was spelt in the sixteenth century\r\nbul-hed, i.e. bull-head, a literal rendering of Front de Boeuf.\r\nWeatherhead (Chapter XIX) is perhaps usually a nickname\r\n\r\n\"For that old weather-headed fool, I know how to laugh at him.\"\r\n\r\n(Congreve, Love for Love, ii.  7.)\r\n\r\nCoxhead is another obvious nickname.  A careful analysis of some of\r\nthe most important medieval name-lists would furnish hundreds of\r\nfurther examples, some too outspoken to have survived into our\r\ndegenerate age, and others which are now so corrupted that their\r\noriginal vigour is quite lost.\r\n\r\nPuns and jokes upon proper names are, pace Gregory the Great and\r\nShakespeare, usually very inept and stupid; but the following lines by\r\nJames Smith, which may be new to some of my readers, are really\r\nclever--\r\n\r\nMen once were surnamed from their shape or estate\r\n   (You all may from History worm it);\r\nThere was Lewis the Bulky, and Henry the Great,\r\n   John Lackland, and Peter the Hermit.\r\nBut now, when the door-plates of Misters and Dames\r\n   Are read, each so constantly varies\r\nFrom the owner's trade, figure, and calling, Surnames\r\n   Seem given by the rule of contraries.\r\n\r\nMr. Box, though provoked, never doubles his fist,\r\n   Mr. Burns, in his grate, has no fuel;\r\nMr. Playfair won't catch me at hazard or whist,\r\n   Mr. Coward was wing'd in a duel.\r\nMr. Wise is a dunce, Mr. King is a whig,\r\n   Mr. Coffin's uncommonly sprightly,\r\nAnd huge Mr. Little broke down in a gig,\r\n   While driving fat Mrs. Golightly.\r\n\r\nMrs.  Drinkwater's apt to indulge in a dram,\r\n   Mrs.  Angel's an absolute fury,\r\nAnd meek Mr. Lyon let fierce Mr. Lamb\r\n   Tweak his nose in the lobby of Drury.\r\nAt Bath, where the feeble go more than the stout,\r\n   (A conduct well worthy of Nero),\r\nOver poor Mr. Lightfoot, confined with the gout,\r\n   Mr. Heaviside danced a Bolero.\r\n\r\nMiss Joy, wretched maid, when she chose Mr. Love,\r\n   Found nothing but sorrow await her;\r\nShe now holds in wedlock, as true as a dove,\r\n   That fondest of mates, Mr. Hayter.\r\nMr. Oldcastle dwells in a modern-built hut,\r\n   Miss Sage is of madcaps the archest;\r\nOf all the queer bachelors Cupid e'er cut,\r\n   Old Mr. Younghusband's the starchest.\r\n\r\nMr. Child, in a passion, knock'd down Mr. Rock,\r\n   Mr. Stone like an aspen-leaf shivers;\r\nMiss Poole used to dance, but she stands like a stock\r\n   Ever since she became Mrs.  Rivers;\r\nMr. Swift hobbles onward, no mortal knows how,\r\n   He moves as though cords had entwin'd him;\r\nMr. Metcalfe ran off, upon meeting a cow,\r\n   With pale Mr. Turnbull behind him.\r\n\r\nMr. Barker's as mute as a fish in the sea,\r\n   Mr. Miles never moves on a journey;\r\nMr. Gotobed sits up till half-after three,\r\n   Mr. Makepeace was bred an attorney.\r\nMr. Gardiner can't tell a flower from a root,\r\n   Mr. Wilde with timidity draws back,\r\nMr. Ryder performs all his journeys on foot,\r\n   Mr. Foote all his journeys on horseback.\r\n\r\nMr. Penny, whose father was rolling in wealth,\r\n   Kick'd down all his fortune his dad won;\r\nLarge Mr. Le Fever's the picture of health,\r\n   Mr. Goodenough is but a bad one.\r\nMr. Cruickshank stept into three thousand a year,\r\n   By showing his leg to an heiress:--\r\nNow I hope you'll acknowledge I've made it quite clear\r\n   That surnames ever go by contraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted by Hazell, Watson & Viney, Ld., London and Aylesbury, England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertising material from the end of the book\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Ernest Weekley, M.A.\r\n\r\nProfessor of French and Head of the Modern Language Department\r\n\r\nat University College, Nottingham.\r\n\r\nAN ETYMOLOGICAL DICTIONARY OF MODERN ENGLISH\r\n\r\nCrown 4to.

The origin and cognates of each\r\nword are given as concisely as possible, but \"etymology\" has been\r\ntaken in its widest sense as a science dealing not only with the\r\nphonetic elements of which words are composed, but also with the\r\nadventures which they have met with during their life in the language\r\nand the strange paths that many of them have followed in reaching a\r\ncurrent sense or use often widely remote from the original.  So far as\r\npossible, the date or epoch of the first appearance of each word is\r\nnoted, and the book will be found to contain much curious information\r\nfor which earlier etymological dictionaries would be ransacked in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF WORDS\r\n\r\nLarge Crown 8vo.

In fact I consider it to be very rewarding, informative,\r\nand entertaining.  I hope you also find it rewarding, and I present it\r\nin much the same mood that I assume it was written in: not that it is\r\nfully correct or definitive, but that both the material and the lines\r\nof thought that the book comprises, are useful, thoughtful, and\r\nenjoyable, taken for what they are worth.  The book certainly is based\r\non a formidable level of erudition, however cheerful the author's\r\nstyle may be.\r\n\r\n* For the most part I have tried to remain true to the source, but\r\nthis is not an attempt to reproduce the volume I scanned; my objective\r\nwas to render its content available.  Accordingly, I did not hesitate\r\nto correct minor, obvious errors, or to adopt my preferences for\r\nspacing and the like.  Also, the means that I employed in preparing\r\nthis material did not lend themselves satisfactorily to preservation\r\nof the original pagination or of numbering and cross reference of pages.\r\nHowever, as the product is machine readable, search is easier than\r\nworking from an index, and I tried to support the use of such\r\nfacilities.  Anyone who feels strongly that an index remains necessary,\r\nis welcome to add an index to the version that I have presented here,\r\nwithout crediting me for the body of the work.\r\n\r\n* I have however, substituted cross-reference between sections or\r\nchapters for  the (now meaningless) cross-references between pages.\r\nAlso, like many books of that day, the original had many page headings\r\nsuch as \"MYTHICAL ETYMOLOGIES\" or \"HILL AND DALE\", without\r\nincorporating them in the table of contents or the text, or even\r\nmaking it clear just where those page headings fitted into the text.\r\nI have changed such page headings to sub-headings within the text,\r\nwhere they are more useful, given that they no longer are necessary\r\nfor the original purpose of aiding the process of flipping through the\r\npages of a paper book.\r\n\r\n* I have relocated footnotes from the feet of the pages to just after\r\nthe text that they qualified.  Apart from thereby rendering the text\r\nless dependent of changes of format, this arguably renders the\r\nfootnotes more useful and less disruptive to the reader.  Footnotes\r\nare marked as such, so as to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\n* I have of course tried to produce as clean a product as possible,\r\nbut I apologetically assure you that some errors remain in the text.\r\nYou accordingly must treat the content with appropriate caution.",
