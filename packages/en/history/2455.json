The English nation, weakened by the Wars of\r\nthe Roses and tired of a contest that possessed little interest for\r\nthe masses, was not unwilling to submit itself without reserve to the\r\nguidance of a strong ruler provided he could guarantee peace both at\r\nhome and abroad. Practically speaking, hitherto absolutism had been\r\nunknown. The rights that had been won by the barons on the plains of\r\nRunnymede were guarded jealously by their descendants, and as a result\r\nthe power of the king, more especially in regard to taxation, was\r\nhedged round by several restrictions. But during the long struggle\r\nbetween the houses of Lancaster and York many of the great feudal\r\nbarons had fallen on the field of battle or by the hands of the\r\nexecutioner, and the power of the nobles as a body had been\r\nundermined. While the Lords could muster their own retainers under\r\ntheir standard and put into the field a strong army almost at a\r\nmoment's notice, it was impossible for the sovereign to rule as an\r\nabsolute monarch. It was because he recognised this fact that Henry\r\nVII. took steps to enforce the Statute of Liveries passed by one of\r\nhis predecessors, and to provide that armies could be levied only in\r\nthe king's name.\r\n\r\nThe day of government by the aristocracy had passed for ever to be\r\nsucceeded by the rule of the people, but in the interval between the\r\nsinking of one and the rise of the other Tudor absolutism was\r\nestablished firmly in England. In selecting his ministers Henry VII.\r\npassed over the nobles in favour of the middle classes, which were\r\ngaining ground rapidly in the country, but which had not yet realised\r\ntheir strength as they did later in the days of the Stuarts. He\r\nobtained grants of tonnage and poundage enjoyed by some of his Yorkist\r\npredecessors, had recourse to the system of forced grants known as\r\nbenevolences, set up the Star Chamber nominally to preserve order but\r\nin reality to repress his most dangerous opponents, and treated\r\nParliament as a mere machine, whose only work was to register the\r\nwishes of the sovereign. In brief, Henry VII., acting according to the\r\nspirit of the age, removed the elements that might make for national\r\ndisunion, consolidated his own power at the expense of the nobility,\r\nwon over to his side the middle and lower classes whose interests were\r\npromoted and from whom no danger was to be feared, and laid the\r\nfoundations of that absolute government, which was carried to its\r\nlogical conclusions by his son and successor, Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nBy nature Henry VII. was neither overbearing nor devoid of tact, and\r\nfrom the doubtful character of his title to the throne he was obliged\r\nto be circumspect in his dealings with the nation. It was not so,\r\nhowever, with Henry VIII. He was a young, impulsive, self-willed\r\nruler, freed from nearly all the dangers that had acted as a restraint\r\nupon his father, surrounded for the most part by upstarts who had no\r\nwill except to please their master, and intensely popular with the\r\nmerchants, farmers, and labourers, whose welfare was consulted, and\r\nwho were removed so far from court that they knew little of royal\r\npolicy or royal oppression. The House of Lords, comprising as it did\r\nrepresentatives of the clergy and nobles, felt itself entirely at the\r\nmercy of the king, and its members, alarmed by the fate of all those\r\nwho had ventured to oppose his wishes, would have decreed the\r\nabolition of their privileges rather than incur his displeasure, had\r\nthey been called upon to do so. The House of Commons was composed to a\r\ngreat extent of the nominees of the Crown, whose names were forwarded\r\nto the sheriffs for formal confirmation. The Parliament of 1523 did\r\nshow some resistance to the financial demands necessitated by the war\r\nwith France, but the king's answer was to dissolve it, and to govern\r\nEngland by royal decrees for a space of six years. Fearing for the\r\nresults of the divorce proceedings and anxious to carry the country\r\nwith him in his campaign against the Pope, Henry VIII. convoked\r\nanother Parliament (1529), but he took careful measures to ensure that\r\nthe new House of Commons would not run counter to his wishes. Lists of\r\npersons who were known to be jealous of the powers of the Church and\r\nto be sympathetic towards any movement that might limit the\r\npretensions of the clergy were forwarded to the sheriffs, and in due\r\ncourse reliable men were returned. That the majority of the members of\r\nthe lower House were hostile to the privileges of the Church is clear\r\nenough, but there is no evidence that any important section desired a\r\nreformation which would involve a change of doctrine or separation\r\nfrom Rome. The legislation directed against the rights of the Pope\r\nsanctioned by this Parliament was accepted solely through the\r\ninfluence of royal threats and blandishments, and because the\r\nParliament had no will of its own. Were the members free to speak and\r\nact according to their own sentiments it is impossible to believe that\r\nthey would have confirmed and annulled the successive marriages of the\r\nking, altered and realtered the succession to meet every new\r\nmatrimonial fancy of his, and proved themselves such negligent\r\nguardians of the rights of the English nation as to allow him to\r\ndispose of the crown of England by will as he might dispose of his\r\nprivate possessions. Henry VIII. was undisputed master of England, of\r\nits nobles, clergy, and people, of its Convocation, and Parliament.\r\nHis will was the law. Unless this outstanding fact, royal absolutism\r\nand dictatorship be realised, it is impossible to understand how a\r\nwhole nation, which till that time had accepted the Pope as the Head\r\nof the Church, could have been torn against its will from the centre\r\nof unity, separated from the rest of the Catholic world, and subjected\r\nto the spiritual jurisdiction of a sovereign, whose primary motive in\r\neffecting such a revolution was the gratification of his own unbridled\r\npassions.\r\n\r\nIt is not true to assert, as some writers have asserted, that before\r\nthe Reformation England was a land shrouded in the mists of ignorance;\r\nthat there were no schools or colleges for imparting secular education\r\ntill the days of Edward VI.; that apart from practices such as\r\npilgrimages, indulgences, and invocation of the saints, there was no\r\nreal religion among the masses; that both secular and regular clergy\r\nlived after a manner more likely to scandalise than to edify the\r\nfaithful; that the people were up in arms against the exactions and\r\nprivileges of the clergy, and that all parties only awaited the advent\r\nof a strong leader to throw off the yoke of Rome. These are sweeping\r\ngeneralisations based upon isolated abuses put forward merely to\r\ndiscredit the English mediaeval Church, but wholly unacceptable to\r\nthose who are best acquainted with the history of the period. On the\r\nother side it would be equally wrong to state that everything was so\r\nperfect in England that no reforms were required. Many abuses,\r\nundoubtedly, had arisen in various departments of religious life, but\r\nthese abuses were of such a kind that they might have been removed had\r\nthe Convocations of the clergy been free to pursue their course, nor\r\ndo they justify an indiscriminate condemnation of the entire\r\necclesiastical body.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Renaissance movement had made great progress on\r\nthe other side of the Alps before its influence could be felt even in\r\neducated circles in England, but once the attention of the English\r\nscholars was drawn to the revival of classical studies many of them\r\nmade their way to the great masters of Italy, and returned to utilise\r\nthe knowledge they had acquired for the improvement of the educational\r\nsystem of their country. Selling and Hadley, both monks, Linacre, one\r\nof the leaders of medical science in his own time, Dean Colet of\r\nWestminster whose direction of St. Paul's College did so much to\r\nimprove the curriculum of the schools,[1] Bishop Fisher of Rochester\r\ndescribed by Erasmus as \"a man without equal at this time both as to\r\nintegrity of life, learning, or broadminded sympathies\" with the\r\npossible exception of Archbishop Warham of Canterbury,[2] and Sir\r\nThomas More, Lord Chancellor of England and one of the earliest\r\nmartyrs for the faith in the reign of Henry VIII., were but a few of\r\nthe prominent men in a movement that made itself felt throughout the\r\nentire country. Nowhere did Erasmus find a more enthusiastic welcome\r\nor more generous patrons and nowhere were his writings more thoroughly\r\nappreciated than in England.\r\n\r\nNor is it true to say that the advocates of classical learning were\r\nanimated by hostility to the Catholic Church in their demand for an\r\nimprovement in educational methods. Some murmurs were, indeed, heard\r\nin certain quarters, and charges of unorthodoxy were formulated\r\nvaguely against Colet and others of his party, but these were but the\r\ncriticisms levelled in all ages against those who are in advance of\r\ntheir time, nor do they require serious refutation. The English\r\nHumanists had nothing in common with the neo-pagan writers of the\r\nItalian Renaissance as regards religion, and they gave no indication\r\nof hostility to Rome. Whatever other influences may have contributed\r\nto bring about the religious revolution in England, it was certainly\r\nnot due to the Renaissance, for to a man its disciples were as loyal\r\nto the Catholic Church as were their two greatest leaders Fisher and\r\nMore, who laid down their lives rather than prove disloyal to the\r\nsuccessor of St. Peter.\r\n\r\nNor was education generally neglected in the country. The lists of\r\nstudents attending Oxford and Cambridge[3] in so far as they have been\r\npreserved point to the fact that in the days immediately preceding the\r\nReformation these great seats of learning were in a most flourishing\r\ncondition, and that for them the religious revolt fell little short of\r\nproving disastrous. The explanation of the sudden drop in the number\r\nof students attending the universities is to be found partially at\r\nleast in the disturbed condition of the country, but more particularly\r\nin the destruction of the religious houses, which sent up many of\r\ntheir members to Oxford and Cambridge, and which prepared a great\r\nnumber of pupils in their schools for university matriculation, as\r\nwell as in the confiscation of the funds out of which bishops,\r\nchapters, monasteries, religious confraternities, and religious\r\nguilds, presented exhibitions to enable the children of the poor to\r\navail themselves of the advantages of higher education. Nor was\r\nEngland of the fifteenth century without a good system of secondary\r\nschools. It is a common belief that Edward VI. was the founder of\r\nEnglish secondary colleges, and that during the first fifty years\r\nafter the Reformation more was done for this department of education\r\nthan had been done in the preceding three hundred years. That such a\r\nbelief is entirely erroneous may be proved from the records of the\r\ncommissions held in the reigns of Henry VIII. and Edward VI., from\r\nwhich it appears that there were close on three hundred secondary\r\nschools in England before 1549, and that Henry VIII. and particularly\r\nEdward VI. ought to be regarded as the despoilers rather than as the\r\npatrons of the English colleges. Distinct from the universities and\r\nfrom the mere primary schools there were in existence at the beginning\r\nof the reign of Henry VIII. seven classes of educational\r\nestablishments, namely, cathedral, collegiate, and monastic colleges,\r\ncolleges in connexion with hospitals, guilds, chantries, and\r\nindependent institutions. These were worked in perfect co-ordination\r\nwith the universities, and in most cases exhibitions were provided for\r\nthe poorer scholars. \"The Grammar Schools which existed,\" says a\r\nreliable authority, \"were not mere monkish schools or choristers'\r\nschools or elementary schools. Many of them were the same schools\r\nwhich now live and thrive. All were schools of exactly the same type,\r\nand performing precisely the same sort of functions as the public\r\nschools and grammar schools of to-day. There were indeed also\r\nchoristers' schools and elementary schools. There were scholarships at\r\nschools and exhibitions thence to the universities, and the whole\r\nparaphernalia of secondary education. Nor was secondary education\r\nunderstood in any different sense to that in which it was understood\r\nup to fifty years ago. It was conducted on the same lines and in the\r\nmain by instruments of the same kind, if not identically the same, as\r\nthose in use till the present generation.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said with justice that the English people at the time\r\nwere either badly instructed in the principles of their religion or\r\nindifferent to the practices of the Church to which they belonged. The\r\ndecrees of the Synod of Oxford (1281), commanding the clergy who had\r\ncare of souls to explain regularly in simple language, intelligible to\r\ntheir hearers the articles of the creed, the commandments, the\r\nsacraments, the seven deadly sins and the seven works of mercy, were\r\nrenewed more than once, and presumably were enforced by the bishops.\r\nThe books published for the instruction of the faithful as for\r\nexample, /The Work for Householders/, /Dives et Pauper/, /The\r\nInterpretation and Signification of the Mass/, /The Art of Good\r\nLiving/, etc., emphasise very strongly the duty of attending the\r\nreligious instruction given by the clergy, while the manuals written\r\nfor the guidance of the clergy make it very clear that preaching was a\r\nportion of their duties that should not be neglected. The fact that\r\nreligious books of this kind were multiplied so quickly, once the art\r\nof printing had been discovered, affords strong evidence that neither\r\npriests nor people were unmindful of the need for a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the truths of their religion. The visitations of the\r\nparishes, during which some of the prominent parishioners were\r\nsummoned to give evidence about the manner in which the priests\r\nperformed their duty of instructing the people, were in themselves a\r\ngreat safeguard against pastoral negligence, and so far as they have\r\nbeen published they afford no grounds for the statement that the\r\npeople were left in ignorance regarding the doctrines and practices of\r\ntheir religion. Apart entirely from the work done by the clergy in the\r\npulpits and churches, it should be remembered that in the cities and\r\neven in the most remote of the rural parishes religious dramas were\r\nstaged at regular intervals, and were of the greatest assistance in\r\nbringing before the minds even of the most uneducated the leading\r\nevents of biblical history and the principal truths of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThat the people of England as a body hearkened to the instructions of\r\ntheir pastors is clear enough from the testimony of foreign visitors,\r\nfrom the records of the episcopal visitations, the pilgrimages to\r\nshrines of devotion at home and abroad, from the anxiety for God's\r\nhonour and glory as shown in the zeal which dictated the building or\r\ndecoration of so many beautiful cathedrals and churches, the funds for\r\nwhich were provided by rich and poor alike, and from the spirit of\r\ncharity displayed in the numerous bequests for the relief of the poor\r\nand the suffering. The people of England at the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century were neither idol-worshippers nor victims of a blind\r\nsuperstition. They understood just as well as Catholics understand at\r\nthe present day devotions to Our Lady and to the Saints; Images,\r\nPictures and Statues, Purgatory, Indulgences and the effects of the\r\nMass. Nor were they so ignorant of the Sacred Scriptures as is\r\ncommonly supposed. The sermons were based upon some Scripture text\r\ntaken as a rule from the epistle and gospel proper to the Sunday or\r\nfestival, and were illustrated with a wealth of references and\r\nallusions drawn from both the Old and New Testament sufficient to make\r\nit clear that the Bible was not a sealed book either for the clergy or\r\nlaity. The fact that there was such a demand for commentaries on and\r\nconcordances to the Scriptures makes it clear that the clergy realised\r\nsufficiently the importance of Scriptural teaching from the pulpits,\r\nand the abundant quotations to be found in the books of popular\r\ndevotion, not to speak of the religious dramas based upon events in\r\nbiblical history, go far to show that the needs of the laity in this\r\nrespect were not overlooked.[5]\r\n\r\nIt is said, however, that the use of the Scriptures in the vernacular\r\nwas forbidden to the English people, and a decree of a Synod held at\r\nOxford in 1408 is cited in proof of this statement. The Synod of\r\nOxford did not forbid the use of vernacular versions. It forbade the\r\npublication or use of unauthorised translations,[6] and in the\r\ncircumstances of the time, when the Lollard heretics were strong and\r\nwere endeavouring to win over the people to their views by\r\ndisseminating corrupt versions of the Scripture, such a prohibition is\r\nnot unintelligible. It should be borne in mind that French was the\r\nlanguage of the educated and was the official language of the English\r\nlaw courts and of the Parliament till after 1360. The French or Latin\r\nversions then current were, therefore, amply sufficient for those who\r\nwere likely to derive any advantage from the study of the Bible, while\r\nat the same time the metrical paraphrases of the important books of\r\nthe Old Testament and of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, and the\r\nEnglish prose translation of the Psalms, went far to meet the wants of\r\nthe masses. From the clear evidence of writers like Sir Thomas More,\r\nLord Chancellor of England and one of the best informed men of his\r\ntime, of Cranmer, the first Protestant Archbishop of Canterbury, and\r\nof Foxe the author of the so-called Martyrology, it can be established\r\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt that prior to the Reformation there\r\nexisted an English Catholic version of the Scriptures, which was\r\napproved for use by the ecclesiastical authorities.[7] It is true,\r\nindeed, that the bishops of England made extraordinary efforts to\r\nprevent the circulation of the versions made by Tyndale and Coverdale,\r\nbut considering the glosses, the corruptions, and the mis-translations\r\nwith which these abound no fair-minded person could expect them to\r\nhave acted otherwise. Their action was not dictated by hostility to\r\nthe reading of the Scriptures but by their opposition to heretical\r\ndoctrines, which it was sought to disseminate among the people by\r\nmeans of dishonest versions of the Scriptures. The English bishops\r\nwere not content merely with prohibiting the use of these works. They\r\nwere most anxious to bring out a correct translation of the Scriptures\r\nfor general use, and were prevented from doing so only by the action\r\nof Henry VIII. and of the heretical advisers, who urged him to make it\r\nimpossible for the bishops to carry out their design.[8]\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be far from the truth to assert that everything was\r\nfaultless during the years preceding the Reformation, or that all the\r\nclergy were as perfect as they might have been. England, like every\r\nother country at the same period, was afflicted with the terrible\r\nevils resulting from the appropriation of parishes by laymen and by\r\nreligious establishments, a system which made it impossible for a\r\nbishop to govern his diocese properly, from the non-residence of both\r\nbishops and higher clergy, and from the plurality of benefices, which\r\nmeant that a person might be permitted to hold two or more benefices\r\nto which the care of souls was attached, thereby rending impossible\r\nthe proper discharge of pastoral duties. More priests, too, were\r\nordained than could be provided with appointments, and consequently\r\nmany of the clergy were forced to act as chaplains and tutors in\r\nprivate families, where they were treated as servants rather than as\r\nequals, and where it was only too easy for them to lose the sense of\r\nrespect for their dignity and for themselves, and to sink to the level\r\nof those with whom they were obliged to consort. It is not to be\r\nwondered at if evidence is forthcoming that in particular cases, more\r\nespecially in Wales, clerical celibacy was not observed as it should\r\nhave been, or that in several instances the duty of preaching and\r\ninstructing the people was not discharged, nor is it surprising to\r\nfind that men who were comparatively unlearned were promoted over the\r\nheads of their more educated companions to the disgust of the\r\nuniversities and of those interested in the better education of the\r\nclergy. Considering the fact that so many of the bishops were engaged\r\nin the service of the State to the neglect of their duties in their\r\ndioceses, and bearing also in mind the selfish use made too frequently\r\nof the rights of lay patronage and the disorganisation to which even\r\nthe most enlightened use of such patronage was likely to lead, it is\r\nlittle less than marvellous that the great body of the clergy were as\r\neducated, zealous, and irreproachable as they can be proved to have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the disorganisation wrought by the Black Plague, the\r\ncivil strife which disturbed the peace of the country, and the\r\nconstant interference of the crown and lay patrons, many of the\r\nreligious houses, influenced to some extent by the general spirit of\r\nlaxity peculiar to the age, fell far short of the standard of severity\r\nand discipline that had been set in better days. While on the one hand\r\nit should be admitted freely that some of the monastic and conventual\r\nestablishments stood in urgent need of reform, there is, on the other\r\nside, no sufficient evidence to support the wild charges of wholesale\r\ncorruption and immorality levelled against the monks and nuns of\r\nEngland by those who thirsted for their destruction. The main\r\nfoundation for such an accusation is to be sought for in the letters\r\nand reports (/Comperta/) of the commissioners sent out to examine into\r\nthe condition of the monasteries and convents in 1535. Even if these\r\ndocuments could be relied upon as perfectly trustworthy they affect\r\nonly a very small percentage of the religious houses, since not more\r\nthan one-third of these establishments were visited by the\r\ncommissioners during their hurried tour through the country, and as\r\nregards the houses visited serious crimes were preferred against at\r\nmost two hundred and fifty monks and nuns.\r\n\r\nBut there are many solid grounds for rejecting the reliability of\r\nthese documents. The commissioners were appointed by Cromwell with the\r\nprofessed object of preparing the public mind for the suppression of\r\nthe monasteries and convents. They showed themselves to be his most\r\nobsequious agents, always ready to accept as testimony popular rumours\r\nand suspicions founded in many cases on personal dislikes, and, like\r\ntheir master, more anxious to extract money bribes from the religious\r\nthan to arrive at the truth about their lives or the condition of\r\ntheir establishments. That they were prejudiced witnesses, arrogant\r\nand cruel towards the monks and nuns, and willing to do anything that\r\nmight win them the approval of Cromwell and the king is evident from\r\ntheir own letters and reports, while if we are to credit the\r\nstatements of contemporaries, backed by a tradition, which survived\r\nfor centuries amongst the Catholic body in England, they were most\r\nunscrupulous and immoral in their attitude towards the unfortunate\r\nnuns who were placed at their mercy. Indeed the charges which they\r\nmake are so filthy and repulsive, and the delight with which they\r\nrevel in such abominations is so apparent, that one is forced to the\r\nconviction that they must have been men of depraved tastes quite\r\ncapable of committing or of attempting to commit the crimes laid to\r\ntheir charge. Even if it had been otherwise, had the two commissioners\r\nbeen unprejudiced and fair in their proceedings, it is impossible to\r\nunderstand how they could have had an opportunity of making a really\r\nsearching investigation into the condition of the monasteries and\r\nconvents during the short time assigned for the work. They began only\r\nin July 1535 and their work was completed in February 1536.\r\n\r\nIn favour of the reliability of these reports the fact is urged that\r\nthey were placed before Parliament, and that the members of both\r\nHouses were so impressed by the tale of corruption and wickedness\r\nwhich they disclosed that they decided on the immediate suppression of\r\nthe monasteries. If this were true and if Parliament in the days of\r\nHenry VIII. enjoyed the same rights and privileges as it enjoys to-day\r\nsuch action would be in itself a strong corroboration of the veracity\r\nof the commissioners. But there is no sufficient evidence to prove\r\nthat the reports or compilations made from them were ever submitted to\r\nParliament. The king and Cromwell informed the Houses of the charges\r\nmade by the commissioners, and demanded their consent to the bill of\r\nsuppression. The whole measure was passed in a few days (11th to 18th\r\nMarch, 1536) and there is no proof that the /Comperta/ or a \"Black\r\nBook\" were presented to the members. On the contrary, it is clear from\r\nthe preamble to the Act that in the larger monasteries \"religion was\r\nright well kept and observed,\" and that it was only in the smaller\r\nhouses with less than twelve members that disorder and corruption\r\nexisted, whereas in the reports of the commissioners no such\r\ndistinction is observed, the charges being levelled just as strongly\r\nagainst the larger as against the smaller communities. Had Parliament\r\nbeen in possession of the reports or had there been any adequate\r\ndiscussion, it is difficult to see how such an arbitrary distinction,\r\nfounded neither on the nature of things, nor on the findings of the\r\ncommissioners, could have been allowed to pass. It is noteworthy too\r\nthat many of the individuals, whose names were associated in the\r\n/Comperta/ with very serious crimes, were placed in the possession of\r\npensions on the dissolution of the monasteries, and some of them were\r\npromoted to the highest ecclesiastical offices in the gift of the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nBesides, if the reports of Leigh and Leyton be compared with the\r\nepiscopal visitations of the same houses or with those of the royal\r\nvisitors appointed in 1536 to carry out the suppression of the smaller\r\nmonasteries, it will be found that in regard to the very same houses\r\nthere exists a very open contradiction between their findings.\r\nUnfortunately the accounts of the visitations have disappeared to a\r\ngreat extent except in case of the diocese of Norwich. In this diocese\r\nthe visitations were carried out very strictly and very minutely, and\r\nalthough some abuses were detected the bishop could find nothing of\r\nthe wholesale corruption and immorality discovered a few years later\r\nby the minions of Cromwell. Similarly the commission appointed in 1536\r\nto superintend the suppression decreed in that year, the members of\r\nwhich were drawn from the leading men in each county, report in the\r\nhighest terms of houses which were spoken of as hot-beds of iniquity\r\nonly a few months before. Finally, if the monasteries and convents\r\nwere really so bad as they are painted, it is a curious fact that\r\nalthough Leigh and Leyton were empowered by Cromwell to open the doors\r\nto many of the monks and nuns they could find in the thirteen counties\r\nwhich they visited only two nuns and fifty-three monks willing to\r\navail themselves of the liberty which they offered.[9]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the monasteries were regarded with kindly feelings\r\nby the great body of the people on account of their charity and\r\nhospitality towards the poor and the wayfarer, their leniency and\r\ngenerosity as compared with other employers and landlords, their\r\nschools which did so much for the education of the district, and their\r\norphanages and hospitals. Many of them were exceedingly wealthy, while\r\nsome of them found it difficult to procure the means of existence, and\r\nall of them suffered greatly from the financial burdens imposed upon\r\nthem in the shape of pensions, etc., by the king or by the family by\r\nwhom their endowments were provided originally. For this reason some\r\nof the religious houses, imitating the example of the landowners\r\ngenerally, began to form grazing enclosures[10] out of their estates\r\nwhich had been hitherto under cultivation, a step that led in some\r\ncases to eviction and in all cases to a great reduction in the number\r\nof labourers employed. Others of them set up tanneries and such like\r\nindustries that had been best left to the laymen. These measures led\r\nto ill-feeling and to a certain amount of hostility, but that the\r\nreligious houses were not hated by the people is proved to\r\ndemonstration by the rebellions which their suppression evoked in so\r\nmany different parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in a general way that the relations between priests and\r\npeople were neither particularly close nor particularly strained. The\r\nrights and privileges claimed by the clergy did indeed give rise to\r\nmurmurings and complaints in certain quarters, but these were neither\r\nso serious nor so general as to indicate anything like a deep-rooted\r\nand sharp division between priests and people. The question of the\r\nrights of sanctuary, according to which criminals who escaped into the\r\nenclosures of monasteries and churches were guaranteed protection from\r\narrest, led to a sharp conflict between the ecclesiastical and secular\r\njurisdictions, but with a little moderation on both sides it was not a\r\nmatter that could have excited permanent ill-feeling. In the days when\r\nmight was right the privileges of sanctuary served a useful purpose.\r\nThat in later times they occasioned serious abuses could not be\r\ndenied, and on the accession of Henry VII. the Pope restricted the\r\nrights of sanctuary very considerably, thereby setting an example\r\nwhich it was to be expected would have been followed by his\r\nsuccessors. The /privilegium fori/, by which clerics were exempted\r\nfrom punishment by a secular tribunal, was another cause of\r\nconsiderable friction. In 1512 Parliament passed a law abolishing this\r\nprivilege in case of clerics accused of murder, etc., and though it\r\nwas to have force only for two years it excited the apprehension of\r\nthe clergy more on account of what it heralded than of what it\r\nactually enacted. When it came up again for discussion in 1515 even\r\nthose of the clergy who were most remarkable for their subservience to\r\nthe king protested vehemently against it. In a discussion that took\r\nplace in the presence of Henry VII. one of the friars brought forward\r\nmany arguments to prove that such a law was not outside the competence\r\nof the state, much to the disgust of the bishops and of Cardinal\r\nWolsey. The king was most emphatic in his declaration that he intended\r\nto take such action as would vindicate and safeguard his rights as\r\nsupreme lord of England, but notwithstanding this sharp reproof to his\r\nopponents the measure was allowed to drop.\r\n\r\nThe excessive fees charged in the episcopal courts for the probate of\r\nwills, the gifts known as mortuaries claimed on occasions of death,\r\nthe absence of the bishops and the clergy from their dioceses and\r\nparishes to the consequent neglect of their duties to the people, the\r\nbestowal of benefices oftentimes on poorly qualified clerics to the\r\nexclusion of learned and zealous priests, the appointment of clerics\r\nto positions that should have been filled by laymen on the lands of\r\nthe bishops and monasteries, and the interference of some of the\r\nclergy both secular and regular in purely secular pursuits were the\r\nprincipal grievances brought forward in 1529 by the House of Commons\r\nagainst the spirituality. But in determining the value of such a\r\ndocument it should be remembered that it was inspired by the king, and\r\nin fact drafted by Thomas Cromwell, at a time when both king and\r\nminister were determined to crush the power of the Church, and that,\r\ntherefore, it is not unreasonable to expect that it is exaggerated and\r\nunfair. According to the express statement of Sir Thomas More, Lord\r\nChancellor of England, who was in a position to know and appreciate\r\nthe relations between clergy and people, the division was neither so\r\nacute nor so serious as it was painted by those who wished to favour\r\nreligious innovations or to ingratiate themselves with the king and\r\nhis advisers.[11]\r\n\r\nBut, even though there existed some differences of opinion about\r\nmatters concerned with the temporalities of the Church or the\r\nprivileges of the clergy, there is no indication during the thirty\r\nyears preceding the revolt of any marked hostility to the doctrines\r\nand practices of the Church. In an earlier age the Lollards, as the\r\nfollowers of Wycliff were called, put forward doctrines closely akin\r\nto those advocated by the early Reformers, notably in regard to the\r\nconstitution of the Church, the Papacy, the Scriptures,\r\nTransubstantiation, Purgatory, and Tradition, but the severe measures\r\nadopted by both Church and State had succeeded in breaking the\r\ninfluence of Lollardy in England. Very few if any followers of this\r\nsect remained to disturb the peace of the community in the early years\r\nof the reign of Henry VIII., though it is quite possible that the\r\nmemory of their teaching and of the sturdy struggle which they had\r\nwaged did not fail to produce its effects at a later period. It is\r\ntrue that in 1512 the statement is attributed to the Bishop of London\r\nin connexion with the trial of an ecclesiastic, that on account of\r\ntheir leaning towards heresy any twelve men of the city would bring in\r\na verdict of guilty against a cleric placed on his trial before\r\nthem,[12] but it is impossible to believe that such a statement\r\nconveys an accurate view of the state of affairs. It is out of harmony\r\nwith the results of the episcopal visitations, with the records of the\r\nfew trials for heresy which took place, most of which resulted in the\r\nrepentance of the alleged culprits, and with the considered judgment\r\nof such a well qualified contemporary authority as Sir Thomas More.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that during the first quarter of the sixteenth century\r\nthe student of history will search in vain for any evidence of\r\nopposition among the clergy and people of England to the spiritual\r\nsupremacy of the Holy See. Disputes there had been, some of which were\r\npeculiarly bitter in their tone, between the English sovereigns and\r\nthe Pope. Complaints had been made by the clergy against what they\r\nconsidered the unwarranted interferences of the Roman Curia in\r\ndomestic affairs; but these disputes and complaints were concerned\r\neither with purely secular matters, as for example the annual tribute\r\nclaimed by the Holy See since the famous surrender of the kingdom made\r\nby King John, or with the temporal side of the spiritual jurisdiction.\r\nThe clergy and people resented generally the wholesale rights of\r\nreservation exercised by the Pope in regard to English benefices, the\r\nappointment of foreigners to offices in England, the heavy taxes\r\nlevied by the Roman Curia directly or indirectly in the shape of\r\nAnnats or First Fruits, the withdrawal of comparatively trivial cases\r\nfrom the local courts, and the exercise of jurisdiction over the\r\nhighest dignitaries of England by the legates commissioned by the Holy\r\nSee. But it is one thing to criticise the actual working of papal\r\nsupremacy as interpreted by Roman officials, or to seek to limit its\r\nexercise in the every-day life of any particular church, and another\r\nto call in question the supremacy itself. The English clergy and\r\npeople did, indeed, object to allow papal supremacy to be pushed too\r\nfar in what they regarded as purely domestic affairs, but even in the\r\nmost prolonged and heated discussions they never once questioned the\r\nfact that the Pope was Supreme Head of the Church in England, or that\r\nhe was Supreme Head of the Catholic Church throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe Statute of Provisors (1350-1), by which all appointments to\r\nEnglish benefices were to be made by canonical election or by the\r\nnomination of lay patrons to the exclusion of papal provisions, is\r\ncited sometimes as a proof that the English nation disregarded the\r\nclaims of the Holy See, but with equal justice and for a similar\r\nreason it might be maintained that the Council of Trent rejected the\r\nSupremacy of the Pope (Session xxiv., chap. 19). The Statute was\r\ncalled for, owing to the spiritual and economic losses inflicted on\r\nthe country by the appointment of foreigners, and its passage was\r\nsecured mainly by the lay patrons, whose rights of patronage were\r\ninfringed by the constant stream of papal provisions. It was neither\r\ninspired by hostility to the Holy See, nor by any doubt about the\r\nsupremacy of the Pope, and in itself it was a piece of legislation\r\nthat might have merited the approval of the most loyal supporters of\r\nRome. But as a matter of fact, lest their acceptance of such a measure\r\nmight be misunderstood, the English bishops offered the most strenuous\r\nopposition to the Statute of Provisors and insisted that their\r\nprotests against it should be registered, a policy which, it might be\r\nadded, was followed by the University of Oxford. The bishops demanded\r\nlater on that it should be repealed. Their request was not granted,\r\nbut from the numerous provisions made to bishoprics in England and\r\nfrom the appointments made to English benefices during the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries it is evident that the Statute was allowed to\r\nfall into abeyance. Similarly the Statute of Praemunire (1353) by\r\nwhich it was forbidden under the penalty of forfeiture and outlawry to\r\nbring cases cognizable in the English courts before foreign courts, or\r\nto introduce into the realm provisions, reservations, or letters\r\ncontrary to the rights of the king or his subjects, was passed to\r\nprevent an undoubted abuse at the time, and was enforced rarely as the\r\nfrequent appeals to Rome amply prove.\r\n\r\nThese measures serve to indicate at most only the attitude of the\r\nCrown towards the Pope, not the attitude of the English clergy and\r\npeople. The loyal submission of the latter is evidenced from the papal\r\nappointments to bishoprics and benefices, from the First Fruits paid\r\nwillingly to the Holy See by those who were called upon to pay them,\r\nby the constant interference of the Holy See in regard to the division\r\nand boundaries of parishes, the visitation of monasteries, the rights\r\nof bishops, etc., as well as by the courts held in England in virtue\r\nof the jurisdiction of the Pope. That the Pope was above the law and\r\nthat to dispute the authority of a papal decree was to be guilty of\r\nheresy was a principle recognised by the English ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities and accepted also in practice by English jurists. The\r\noaths of loyalty to the Holy See taken by all the archbishops and\r\nbishops, the tone and form of the letters addressed to the Pope, the\r\nassertion of papal rights against the errors and attacks of Wycliff\r\nand Luther, the full admission of papal supremacy contained in Henry\r\nVIII.'s /Assertio Septem Sacramentorum/, and in the formal dying\r\ndeclaration of Archbishop Warham of Canterbury (1533), and the\r\nresolute attitude of two such learned representatives of the English\r\nclergy and laity as Bishop Fisher of Rochester and Sir Thomas More,\r\nare in themselves sufficient to establish the fact that in the days of\r\nHenry VIII. England joined with the rest of the Catholic world in\r\nrecognising the supreme spiritual jurisdiction of the Bishop of\r\nRome.[13]\r\n\r\nThe controversies which had raged were not concerned with spiritual\r\nsupremacy nor were they peculiar to England. Much worse ones had\r\narisen to disturb the friendly relations that should exist between the\r\nHoly See and France or Spain, and yet nobody would care to deny that\r\nboth of these nations acknowledged their subjection to Rome. Neither\r\nwere they between the English clergy or the English people and the\r\nPope; they were waged rather between the Crown and the Holy See. As\r\nroyal absolutism began to develop in Europe the policy of kings was to\r\nincrease their power over the ecclesiastical organisation in their\r\ndominions by lessening the authority of the Pope. This tendency is\r\nbrought out clearly in the concessions wrung from the Pope by\r\nFerdinand I. of Spain and Louis XII. of France, but more especially in\r\nthe Concordat negotiated between Leo X. and Francis I. (1516),\r\naccording to which all appointments in the French Church were vested\r\npractically in the hands of the king. Henry VIII. was a careful\r\nobserver of Continental affairs and was as anxious as Francis I. to\r\nstrengthen his own position by grasping the authority of the Church.\r\nHe secured a /de facto/ headship of the Church in England when he\r\nsucceeded in getting Cardinal Wolsey invested with permanent legatine\r\npowers. Through Wolsey he governed ecclesiastical affairs in England\r\nfor years, and on the fall of Wolsey he took into his own hands the\r\ncontrol that he had exercised already through his favourite and\r\nminister. Had Leo X. consented to a concordat similar to that\r\nconcluded with France, whereby the royal demands would have been\r\nconceded frankly and occasions of dispute removed, or else had he\r\ntaken the strong step of refusing to delegate his authority\r\nindefinitely to a minister of the king, he would have prevented\r\ntrouble and misunderstanding, and would have made the battle for royal\r\nsupremacy much more difficult than it proved to be in reality.\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] Lupton, /Life of Dean Colet/, 1887.\r\n\r\n[2] Gasquet, /Eve of the Reformation/, 142.\r\n\r\n[3] Chalmers, /History of the College ... of Oxford/.

(1509-47) was hailed with joy by all\r\nclasses in England. Young, handsome, well-developed both in mind and\r\nbody, fond of outdoor games and amusements, affable and generous with\r\nwhomsoever he came into contact, he was to all appearances qualified\r\nperfectly for the high office to which he had succeeded. With the\r\nexception of Empson and Dudley, who were sacrificed for their share in\r\nthe execution of his father, most of the old advisers were retained at\r\nthe royal court; but the chief confidants on whose advice he relied\r\nprincipally were his Chancellor Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury and\r\nLord Chancellor of England, Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester and Lord\r\nPrivy Seal, and Thomas Howard, afterwards Duke of Norfolk, Lord\r\nTreasurer of the kingdom. Soon, however, these trusted and loyal\r\nadvisers were obliged to make way for a young and rising\r\necclesiastical courtier, Thomas Wolsey[1] (1471-1530), who for close\r\non twenty years retained the first place in the affections of his\r\nsovereign and the chief voice in the direction of English affairs. As\r\na youth, Wolsey's marvellous abilities astonished his teachers at\r\nMagdalen College, where the boy bachelor, as he was called because he\r\nobtained the B.A. degree at the age of fifteen, was regarded as a\r\nprodigy. As a young man he was pushed forward by his patrons, the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Winchester, and won favour\r\nat court by the successful accomplishment of a delicate mission\r\nentrusted to him by Henry VII., till at last in 1511 he was honoured\r\nby a seat in the privy council. New dignities were heaped upon him by\r\nPope and sovereign in turn. He was appointed Bishop of Lincoln and\r\nArchbishop of York (1514), was created a cardinal of the Roman Church\r\n(1515), and in a short time he accepted the offices of Lord Chancellor\r\nand papal legate for England. If he did not succeed in reaching the\r\npapal throne, a dignity to which he was induced to aspire by the\r\npromise of Charles V., his position as legate made him at least\r\nvirtual head of the English Church. Instead of being annoyed, Henry\r\nVIII. was delighted at the honours showered upon his Lord Chancellor\r\nby the Roman court. With Wolsey as his obedient minister and at the\r\nsame time an ecclesiastical dictator, he felt that he had more\r\nauthority in ecclesiastical affairs than was granted to Francis I. by\r\nthe Concordat of 1516, and, though possibly at the time he did not\r\nadvert to it, he was thus preparing the way for exercising in his own\r\nname the control that he had exercised for years through his chief\r\nminister in the name of the Pope.\r\n\r\nThe dream of reconquering the English possessions in France induced\r\nHenry VIII., during the early years of his reign, to side with the\r\nEmperor Maximilian and Ferdinand of Spain against Louis XII.; but the\r\ncomparative failure of the expeditions undertaken against France, the\r\nresentment of the people who were burdened with taxation, and the\r\nadvice of Cardinal Wolsey, led him to forego his schemes of conquest\r\nfor a time in favour of a policy of neutrality. The election of\r\nCharles V. in 1519 changed the whole aspect of affairs on the\r\nContinent, and raised new hopes both in the minds of Henry VIII. and\r\nof his faithful minister. An alliance with Charles V. might mean for\r\nEngland the complete subjugation of France, and for Cardinal Wolsey\r\nthe votes of the cardinals at the approaching conclave. While\r\npretending to act the part of mediator between the rival sovereigns,\r\nHenry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor in 1521, and\r\nprepared to make war on France. The failure of the forces dispatched\r\nunder the Earl of Surrey, the disappointment of Wolsey when he found\r\nhimself deceived by Charles V. at the conclaves of 1521 and 1523, and\r\nthe outcry raised in Parliament and throughout the country against the\r\nFrench war, induced Henry VIII. to reconsider his foreign policy. The\r\ndefeat and capture of Francis I. at Pavia (1525) placed France at the\r\nmercy of the Emperor, and made it necessary for Henry to come to the\r\nrelief of his old enemy unless he wished to see England sink to the\r\nlevel of an imperial province. Overtures for peace were made to\r\nFrance, and in April 1527 Grammont, Bishop of Tarbes, arrived in\r\nEngland to discuss the terms of an alliance. The position of Cardinal\r\nWolsey, which had been rendered critical by the hatred of the nobles,\r\nwho resented his rule as the rule of an upstart, and by the enmity of\r\nthe people, who regarded him as the author of the French war and of\r\nthe increased taxation, was now threatened seriously by the public\r\ndiscussion of difficulties that had arisen in the mind of the king\r\nregarding the validity of his marriage.\r\n\r\nThe Lutheran movement that broke out in Germany two years after\r\nCardinal Wolsey's acceptance of the twofold office of papal legate and\r\nroyal chancellor, found little favour in England. Here and there, at\r\nOxford, at Cambridge, and in London, individuals were found to\r\nsubscribe to portion of Luther's programme; but the great body of the\r\npeople remained unmoved by the tirades of the German reformers against\r\nRome. Henry VIII., whose attention to religion was noted as one of his\r\ncharacteristics by the observant Ambassador of Venice, did not\r\nhesitate to take the field against the enemies of the Holy See and\r\nmore especially against Luther himself. In a work entitled /Assertio\r\nSeptem Sacramentorum/ (Defence of the Seven Sacraments)[2] published\r\nagainst Luther in 1521, he defended in no uncertain terms the rights\r\nand privileges of the Holy See, and in return for the very valuable\r\nservices that he rendered to religion he was honoured by Leo X. with\r\nthe title /Fidei Defensor/ (Defender of the Faith, 1521).[3] The\r\nexample of the king, and the activity of Cardinal Wolsey and of the\r\nbishops, made it impossible for the few individuals who favoured the\r\nGerman movement to spread their views.\r\n\r\nWere it not for Henry's eagerness to secure a separation from his\r\nwife, Catharine of Aragon, it is highly improbable that the anti-Roman\r\nagitation would have made any considerable progress in England.[4] In\r\n1499 Henry's wife, Catharine of Aragon, had been betrothed by proxy to\r\nhis brother Prince Arthur, heir-apparent to the English throne. She\r\narrived in England two years later, and the marriage was solemnised at\r\nSt. Paul's on the 14th November, 1501. Prince Arthur was then only a\r\nboy of fifteen years of age, and of so delicate a constitution that\r\nfears were entertained by many that his wife must soon don the widow's\r\nweeds. Unfortunately these fears were speedily justified. In April\r\n1502 the Prince fell a victim to a pestilence that raged in the\r\ndistrict round Ludlow Castle to which he and his wife had retired. To\r\nprevent quarrels between Ferdinand and Henry VII. regarding\r\nCatharine's dowry, a marriage was arranged between Catharine and\r\nPrince Henry. The necessary dispensation for a marriage with a\r\ndeceased brother's wife was granted by Julius II. (December 1503), and\r\naccording to the agreement between the courts of England and of Spain,\r\nthe marriage should have taken place as soon as Henry reached the age\r\nof puberty; but owing to certain political changes in Spain, and the\r\nprospect of securing a better match for the heir presumptive to the\r\nEnglish throne, Henry VII. arranged that Prince Henry should appear\r\nbefore Fox, Bishop of Winchester, and lodge a formal protest against a\r\nmarriage agreement that had been concluded during his minority and\r\nwhich he now declared to be null and void (17th June, 1505). This\r\nprotest was kept secret, but for years Catharine was treated with\r\nneglect and left in doubt regarding her ultimate fate. As soon,\r\nhowever, as Henry was free to act for himself on the death of his\r\nfather, the marriage between himself and Catharine was solemnised\r\npublicly (1509), and on the 24th June of the same year the king and\r\nqueen were crowned at Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nFor years Henry and Catharine lived happily together as man and wife.\r\nSeveral children were born to them, all of whom unfortunately died in\r\ntheir infancy except the Princess Mary, afterwards Queen Mary of\r\nEngland. Even before there was any question of separation from his\r\nwife, Henry's relations with some of the ladies at court were not\r\nabove suspicion. By one, Elizabeth Blount, he had a son whom he\r\ncreated Duke of Richmond and to whom at one time he thought of\r\nbequeathing the crown of England. In a short time Mary, the eldest\r\nsister of Anne Boleyn, succeeded to Elizabeth in the affections of the\r\nking. The fact that Catharine was some years older than her husband,\r\nthat infirmity and sorrow for the death of her children had dimmed her\r\ncharms, and that there could be no longer any hope for the birth of an\r\nheir to the throne, preyed on Henry's mind and made him not unwilling\r\nto rid himself of a wife, whom, however, he could not but admire even\r\nthough she had forfeited his love. Were he to die there was no one to\r\nsucceed him but the Princess Mary, and her right to the throne might\r\nbe contested. Even though she succeeded, her marriage must inevitably\r\ncreate great difficulties. Were she to marry a foreign prince, he\r\nfeared that England might become a province; were she to accept the\r\nhand of an English nobleman, a disputed succession ending in civil war\r\nwas far from being improbable. His gloomy anticipations were shared in\r\nby many of his advisers; and Wolsey, who had set his heart on uniting\r\nthe forces of England and France against the Emperor, was not\r\nunwilling to set a seal on the new French anti-imperial alliance by\r\nrepudiating Henry's marriage with the Emperor's aunt, if such a\r\ndissolution could be brought about without infringing the laws of God.\r\n\r\nThough it would seem that doubts had long since arisen in Henry's mind\r\nregarding the lawfulness of his marriage to his deceased brother's\r\nwife, and that questions of policy may have influenced the attitude of\r\nhis advisers towards the projected separation, yet it is certain that\r\nit was the charms of the young and accomplished Anne Boleyn, that\r\nbrought matters to a crisis. With her experience of the gay and\r\ncorrupt court of France, she was not likely to be mistaken about the\r\ninfluence of her charms or the violence of the king's passion. She\r\nwould be the king's wife if he wished; but she would not be, like her\r\nsister, the king's mistress. Overcome by the force of his desires, he\r\ndetermined to rid himself of a wife of whom he was tired, in favour of\r\nher young and more attractive rival. The fact that Catharine had been\r\nmarried to his brother Arthur was seized upon by him to furnish a\r\ndecent pretext for the projected separation. His conscience, he\r\naverred, reproached him for such an incestuous alliance, and for his\r\nown peace of mind it was necessary, he maintained, to submit the\r\nvalidity of his marriage to the decision of the Church.\r\n\r\nThere is no convincing evidence that the idea of a separation from\r\nCatharine originated with Cardinal Wolsey, though the latter, longing\r\nfor a matrimonial alliance of his king with a French princess, and not\r\naware of Henry's intention with regard to Anne, was probably not sorry\r\nwhen he learned of Henry's scruples; and it is not true to say that\r\nthe first doubts regarding the illegitimacy of the Princess Mary were\r\nraised by the French Ambassador in 1527. The whole story of the\r\nnegotiations with France regarding Mary's marriage at the time, makes\r\nit perfectly clear that her legitimacy was assumed. The divorce\r\nproceedings originated in Henry's own mind, and the plan of marrying\r\nAnne Boleyn was kept a secret from Wolsey and from most of the royal\r\nadvisers. When exactly the question of a separation from Catharine was\r\nfirst mooted is uncertain; but there can be no doubt that early in\r\n1527 active steps were taken to secure a condemnation of the marriage.\r\nWolsey entered warmly into the project, but most of the bishops whom\r\nhe consulted were not anxious to assist him; and what was still more\r\nserious Fisher, the learned and saintly Bishop of Rochester, declared\r\nhimself from the beginning a determined opponent. The capture of Rome\r\nby imperial troops (1527) made it imperative that the terms of the\r\nFrench alliance should be completed at once, and Cardinal Wolsey set\r\nout for Paris as the representative of England. While Wolsey was\r\nabsent in France arranging the terms of the alliance, Anne Boleyn took\r\noccasion to warn Henry that his great minister was unreliable, that in\r\nhis heart he was opposed to the separation, and that without his\r\nknowledge or consent negotiations should be opened directly with the\r\nRoman court. An agent was dispatched to Rome and succeeded in securing\r\nan interview with Clement VII., after the latter had made his escape\r\nfrom Rome to Orvieto (December 1527). It was contended on behalf of\r\nthe king that the dispensation granted by Julius II. was null and\r\nvoid. In proof of this it was contended: that in the Bull it had been\r\nstated that Henry desired to marry Catharine, and that the marriage\r\nwas necessary for preserving peace between England and Spain, both of\r\nwhich statements, it was alleged, were false; that at the time the\r\ndisposition was granted Henry was only twelve years of age and\r\ntherefore incapable of accepting it; that several persons mentioned in\r\nthe Bull, as for example, Queen Isabella and Henry VII., had died\r\nbefore the marriage took place; and lastly that when Henry reached the\r\nage of puberty he had protested against the marriage, thereby\r\nrenouncing for himself the favours granted in the Bull of\r\ndispensation.[5] Later on it was contended, by those who favoured the\r\nseparation, that the dispensation was issued by the Pope on the\r\nsupposition that the marriage between Arthur and Catharine had not\r\nbeen consummated, and that therefore, since this condition was not\r\nverified, the dispensation was invalid. But here they were faced with\r\nthe difficulty that the great weight of evidence favoured the view\r\nthat the marriage had not been consummated; that in any case the\r\ndispensation was ample enough to cover both the impediment of affinity\r\nand public honesty; and that, whatever might be said against the Bull\r\nof dispensation, no such objection could be urged against the brief\r\nsaid to have been forwarded by the Pope to the court of Spain.[6] As\r\nthe English agents had been instructed to seek not merely the\r\nappointment of a commission to declare the invalidity of the\r\ndispensation, and consequently of the marriage, but also for a\r\ndispensation which would permit the king to marry a woman related to\r\nhim in the first degree of affinity, whether the affinity had been\r\ncontracted by a lawful or unlawful connexion, it was thought prudent\r\nnot to lay stress on the argument that marriage with the deceased\r\nbrother's wife was prohibited by the divine law, and that, therefore,\r\nthe Pope could not grant a dispensation such as had been issued by\r\nJulius II. At a later date great stress was laid upon this argument.\r\n\r\nClement VII., while not unwilling to grant the dispensation\r\nrequested,[7] did not think it consistent with his own honour or that\r\nof the king, to grant the commission according to the terms drawn up\r\nfor him in England. A new embassy, consisting of Edward Foxe, and Dr.\r\nStephen Gardiner, Wolsey's secretary, was dispatched, and arrived at\r\nOrvieto in March 1528. The victorious progress of the French armies in\r\nItaly (1527-28), by relieving Clement VII. from the pressure of the\r\nimperial party, favoured the petition of Henry VIII. Arguments drawn\r\nfrom canon law and from theology were driven home by Gardiner with a\r\nfluency and wealth of knowledge that astonished the papal advisers,\r\nand when arguments failed, recourse was had to threats of an appeal to\r\na general council, and of the complete separation of England from the\r\nHoly See. The decretal commission demanded by the English ambassadors\r\nwas, however, refused; but, in its place, a decree was issued\r\nempowering Cardinal Wolsey and Cardinal Campeggio to try the case in\r\nEngland and to pronounce a verdict in accordance with the evidence\r\nsubmitted to them. As this fell very far short of what had been\r\ndemanded by the English envoys, new demands were made for a more ample\r\nauthority for the commission, and in view of the danger that\r\nthreatened the Catholic Church in England, Clement VII. yielded so far\r\nas to promise that he would not revoke the jurisdiction of those whom\r\nhe had entrusted with the trial of the case (July 1528).[8]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile news of what was in contemplation was noised abroad. Many of\r\nthe English merchants, fearing that hostility to the empire would lead\r\nto an interruption of their trade especially with the Netherlands,\r\ndetested the new foreign policy of the king, while the great body of\r\nthe people were so strongly on the side of Catharine that were a\r\nverdict to be given against her a popular rebellion seemed inevitable.\r\nSo pronounced was this feeling even in the city of London itself, that\r\nHenry felt it necessary to summon the Lord Mayor and the Corporation\r\nto the royal palace, where he addressed them on the question that was\r\nthen uppermost in men's minds. He spoke of Catharine in terms of the\r\nhighest praise, assured them that the separation proceedings were\r\nbegun, not because he was anxious to rid himself of a wife whom he\r\nstill loved, but because his conscience was troubled with scruples\r\nregarding the validity of his marriage, and that the safety of the\r\nkingdom was endangered by doubts which had been raised by the French\r\nambassador regarding the legitimacy of Princess Mary. To put an end to\r\nthese doubts, and to save the country from the horror of a disputed\r\nsuccession, the Pope had appointed a commission to examine the\r\nvalidity of the marriage; and to the judgment of that commission\r\nwhatever it might be he was prepared to yield a ready submission. He\r\nwarned his hearers, however, that if any person failed to speak of him\r\notherwise than became a loyal subject towards his sovereign condign\r\npunishment would await him. To give effect to these words a search was\r\nmade for arms in the city, and strangers were commanded to depart from\r\nLondon.[9]\r\n\r\nThough the commission had been granted in April, Cardinal Campeggio\r\nwas in no hurry to undertake the work that was assigned to him. He did\r\nnot leave Rome till June, and he proceeded so leisurely on his journey\r\nthrough France that it was only in the first week of October that he\r\narrived in London. In accordance with his instructions, he endeavoured\r\nto dissuade the king from proceeding further with the separation, but\r\nas Henry was determined to marry the lady of his choice even though it\r\nshould prove the ruin of his kingdom, all the efforts of Campeggio in\r\nthis direction were in vain. He next turned his attention to\r\nCatharine, in the hope of persuading her to enter a convent, only to\r\ndiscover that her refusal to take any step likely to cast doubts upon\r\nher own marriage and the legitimacy of her daughter was fixed and\r\nunalterable. At the queen's demand counsel was assigned to her to\r\nplead her cause. The situation was complicated by the fact that Julius\r\nII. appears to have issued two dispensations for Henry's marriage, one\r\ncontained in the Bull sent to England, the other in a brief forwarded\r\nto Ferdinand in Spain. The queen produced a copy of the brief, which\r\nwas drawn up in such a way as to elude most of the objections that\r\nwere urged against the Bull on the ground that the marriage had been\r\nconsummated. The original of the brief was in the hands of the\r\nEmperor, and various attempts were made to secure the original or to\r\nhave it pronounced a forgery by the Pope; but the Emperor was too wily\r\na diplomatist to be caught so easily, and the Pope refused either to\r\norder its production or to condemn it without evidence as a\r\nforgery.[10] This question of the brief was seized upon by Cardinal\r\nCampeggio as a good opportunity for delaying the trial. At last on the\r\n31st May 1529, the legates Wolsey and Campeggio opened the court at\r\nBlackfriars, and summoned Henry and Catharine to appear before them in\r\nperson or by proxy on the 18th June. Both king and queen answered the\r\nsummons, the latter, however, merely to demand justice publicly from\r\nthe king, to protest against the competence and impartiality of the\r\ntribunal, and to lodge a formal appeal to Rome. Her appeal was\r\ndisallowed, and on her refusal to take any further part in the trial\r\nshe was condemned as contumacious; but even still she was not without\r\nbrave and able defenders. Bishop Fisher of Rochester spoke out\r\nmanfully against the unnatural and unlawful proceedings,[11] and his\r\nprotest found an echo not merely in the court itself but throughout\r\nthe country. The friends of Henry, fearing that the Pope might revoke\r\nthe power of the legates, clamoured for an immediate verdict; but this\r\nCampeggio was determined to prevent at all costs. By insisting upon\r\nall the formalities of law he took care to delay the proceedings till\r\nthe 23rd July, when he announced that the legatine court should follow\r\nthe rules of the Roman court, and should, therefore, adjourn to\r\nOctober. Already he was aware of the fact that Clement VII., yielding\r\nto the entreaties of Catharine and the demands of the Emperor, had\r\nreserved the decision of the case to Rome (19th July), and that the\r\nsummons to the king and queen to proceed there to plead their cause\r\nwas already on its way to England.[12]\r\n\r\nHenry, disguising his real feelings, pretended to be satisfied; but in\r\nreality his disappointment was extreme. Anne Boleyn and her friends\r\nthrew the blame entirely on Wolsey. They suggested that the cardinal\r\nhad acted a double part throughout the entire proceedings. For a time\r\nthere was a conflict in the king's mind between the suggestions of his\r\nfriends and the memory of Wolsey's years of loyal service; but at last\r\nHenry was won over to the party of Anne, and Wolsey was doomed to\r\ndestruction. He was deprived of the office of Lord Chancellor which\r\nwas entrusted to Sir Thomas More (Oct. 1529), accused of violating the\r\nstatute of Praemunire by exercising legatine powers, a charge to which\r\nhe pleaded guilty though he might have alleged in his defence the\r\npermission and authority of the king, indicted before Parliament as\r\nguilty of high treason, from the penalty of which he was saved by the\r\nspirited defence of his able follower Thomas Cromwell (Dec.), and\r\nordered to withdraw to his diocese of York (1530). His conduct in\r\nthese trying times soon won the admiration of both friends and foes.\r\nThe deep piety and religion of the man, however much they might have\r\nbeen concealed by his fondness for pomp and display during the days of\r\nhis glory, helped him to withstand manfully the onslaughts of his\r\nopponents. His time was spent in prayer and in the faithful discharge\r\nof his episcopal duties, but the enemies who had secured his downfall\r\nat court were not satisfied. They knew that he had still a strong hold\r\non the affections of the king, and they feared that were any foreign\r\ncomplications to ensue he might be recalled to court and restored to\r\nhis former dignities. They determined therefore to bring about his\r\ndeath. An order for his arrest and committal to the Tower was issued,\r\nbut death intervened and saved him from the fate that was in store for\r\nhim. Before reaching London he took suddenly ill, and died after\r\nhaving received the last consolations of religion (Nov. 1530).\r\n\r\nHenry, having failed to obtain a favourable verdict from the legatine\r\ncommission, determined to frighten the Pope into compliance with his\r\nwishes by showing him that behind the King of England stood the\r\nEnglish Parliament. The most elaborate precautions were taken to\r\nsecure that members likely to be friendly were elected. In many cases\r\ntogether with the writs the names of those whose return the court\r\ndesired were forwarded to the sheriffs.[13] The Parliament that was\r\ndestined to play such a momentous part in English affairs met in 1529.\r\nIt was opened by the king in person attended by Sir Thomas More as\r\nLord Chancellor. At a hint from the proper quarter it directed its\r\nattention immediately to the alleged abuses of the clergy. The\r\nprincipal complaints put forward were the excessive fees and delays in\r\nconnection with the probate of wills, plurality of benefices, and the\r\nagricultural and commercial activity of priests, bishops, and\r\nreligious houses, an activity that was detrimental to themselves and\r\nunfair to their lay competitors. Measures were taken in the House of\r\nCommons to put an end to these exactions and abuses, but when the\r\nbills reached the House of Lords Bishop Fisher lodged an emphatic\r\nprotest for which he was called to account by the king. When\r\nParliament had done enough to show the bishops and the Roman court\r\nwhat might be expected in case Henry's wishes were not complied with\r\nit was prorogued (Dec. 1529), and in the following month a solemn\r\nembassy headed by the Earl of Wiltshire, Anne Boleyn's father, was\r\ndispatched to interview the Pope and Charles V. at Bologna. The envoys\r\nwere instructed to endeavour to win over the Emperor to the king's\r\nplans, but Charles V. regarded their advances with indignation and\r\nrefused to sacrifice the honour of his aunt to the friendship of\r\nEngland. The only result of the embassy was that a formal citation of\r\nHenry to appear at Rome was served on the Earl of Wiltshire, but at\r\nthe request of the latter a delay of some weeks was granted. Unless\r\nsome serious measures were taken immediately, Henry had every reason\r\nto expect that judgment might be given against him at Rome, and that\r\nhe would find himself obliged either to submit unconditionally or to\r\ndefend himself against the combined forces of the Emperor and the King\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nTo prevent or at least to delay such a result and to strengthen the\r\nhands of the English agents at Rome, he determined to follow the\r\nadvice that had been given him by Thomas Cranmer, namely, to obtain\r\nfor the separation from Catharine the approval of the universities and\r\nlearned canonists of the world. Agents were dispatched to Cambridge\r\nand Oxford to obtain a verdict in favour of the king. Finding it\r\nimpossible to secure a favourable verdict from the universities, the\r\nagents succeeded in having the case submitted to a small committee\r\nboth in Cambridge and Oxford, and the judgment of the committees,\r\nthough by no means unanimous, was registered as the judgment of the\r\nuniversities.[14] Francis I. of France, who for political reasons was\r\non Henry's side throughout the whole proceedings, brought pressure to\r\nbear upon the French universities, many of which declared that Henry's\r\nmarriage to Catharine was null and void. In Italy the number of\r\nopinions obtained in favour of the king's desires depended entirely\r\nupon the amount of money at the disposal of his agents.[15] To support\r\nthe verdict of the learned world Henry determined to show Rome that\r\nthe nobility and clergy of his kingdom were in complete sympathy with\r\nhis action. A petition signed by a large number of laymen and a few of\r\nthe bishops and abbots was forwarded to Clement VII. (13th July,\r\n1530).[16] It declared that the question of separation, involving as\r\nit did the freedom of the king to marry, was of supreme importance for\r\nthe welfare of the English nation, that the learned world had\r\npronounced already in the king's favour, and that if the Pope did not\r\ncomply with this request England might be driven to adopt other means\r\nof securing redress even though it should be necessary to summon a\r\nGeneral Council. To this Clement VII. sent a dignified reply (Sept.),\r\nin which he pointed out that throughout the whole proceedings he had\r\nshown the greatest regard for Henry, and that any delay that had\r\noccurred at arriving at a verdict was due to the fact that the king\r\nhad appointed no legal representatives at the Roman courts.[17] The\r\nFrench ambassador also took energetic measures to support the English\r\nagents threatening that his master might be forced to join hands with\r\nHenry if necessary; but even this threat was without result, and the\r\nking's agents were obliged to report that his case at Rome was\r\npractically hopeless, and that at any moment the Pope might insist in\r\nproceeding with the trial.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry realised that marriage with Anne Boleyn meant defiance of\r\nRome he was inclined to hesitate. Both from the point of view of\r\nreligion and of public policy separation from the Holy See was\r\ndecidedly objectionable. While he was in this frame of mind, a prey to\r\npassion and anxiety, it was suggested to him, probably by Thomas\r\nCromwell, the former disciple of the fallen cardinal, that he should\r\nseize this opportunity to strengthen the royal power in England by\r\nchallenging the authority of the Pope, and by taking into his own\r\nhands the control of the wealth and patronage of the Church. The\r\nprospect thus held out to him was so enticing that Henry determined to\r\nfollow the advice, not indeed as yet with the intention of involving\r\nhis kingdom in open schism, but in the hope that the Pope might be\r\nforced to yield to his demands. In December 1530 he addressed a strong\r\nletter to Clement VII. He demanded once more that the validity of his\r\nmarriage should be submitted to an English tribunal, and warned the\r\nPope to abstain from interfering with the rights of the king, if he\r\nwished that the prerogatives of the Holy See should be respected in\r\nEngland.[18]\r\n\r\nThis letter of Henry VIII. was clearly an ultimatum, non-compliance\r\nwith which meant open war. At the beginning of 1531 steps were taken\r\nto prepare the way for royal supremacy. For exercising legatine powers\r\nin England Cardinal Wolsey had been indicted and found guilty of the\r\nviolation of the stature of Praemunire, and as the clergy had\r\nsubmitted to his legatine authority they were charged as a body with\r\nbeing participators in his guilt. The attorney-general filed an\r\ninformation against them to the court of King's Bench, but when\r\nConvocation met it was intimated to the clergy that they might procure\r\npardon for the offence by granting a large contribution to the royal\r\ntreasury and by due submission to the king. The Convocation of\r\nCanterbury offered a sum of £100,000, but the offer was refused unless\r\nthe clergy were prepared to recognise the king as the sole protector\r\nand supreme head of the church and clergy in England. To such a novel\r\nproposal Convocation showed itself decidedly hostile, but at last\r\nafter many consultations had been held Warham, the aged Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, proposed that they should acknowledge the king as \"their\r\nsingular protector only, and supreme lord, and as far as the law of\r\nChrist allows even supreme head.\" \"Whoever is silent,\" said the\r\narchbishop, \"may be taken to consent,\" and in this way by the silence\r\nof the assembly the new formula was passed.[19] At the Convocation of\r\nYork, Bishop Tunstall of Durham, while agreeing to a money payment,\r\nmade a spirited protest against the new title, to which protest Henry\r\nfound it necessary to forward a reassuring reply. Parliament then\r\nratified the pardon for which the clergy had paid so dearly, and to\r\nset at rest the fears of the laity a free pardon was issued to all\r\nthose who had been involved in the guilt of the papal legate.\r\n\r\nClement VII. issued a brief in January 1531, forbidding Henry to marry\r\nagain and warning the universities and the law courts against giving a\r\ndecision in a case that had been reserved for the decision of the Holy\r\nSee. When the case was opened at the Rota in the same month an\r\nexcusator appeared to plead, but as he had no formal authority from\r\nthe king he was not admitted. The case, however, was postponed from\r\ntime to time in the hope that Henry might relent. In the meantime at\r\nthe king's suggestion several deputations waited upon Catharine to\r\ninduce her to recall her appeal to Rome. Annoyed by her obstinacy\r\nHenry sent her away from court, and separated from her her daughter.\r\nAfter November 1531, the king and queen never met again. Popular\r\nfeeling in London and throughout England was running high against the\r\ndivorce, and against any breach with the Emperor, who might close the\r\nFlemish markets to the English merchants. The clergy, who were\r\nindignant that their representatives should have paid such an immense\r\nsum to secure pardon for an offence of which they had not been more\r\nguilty than the king himself, remonstrated warmly against the taxation\r\nthat had been levied on their revenues. Unmindful of the popular\r\ncommotion, Henry proceeded to usurp the power of the Pope and of the\r\nbishops, and though he was outwardly stern in the repression of\r\nheresy, the friends of the Lutheran movement in England boasted\r\npublicly that the king was on their side.\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met again (Jan. 1532), the attacks on the clergy were\r\nrenewed. A petition against the bishops, drawn up by Thomas Cromwell\r\nat the suggestion of Henry,[20] was presented in the name of the House\r\nof Commons to the king. In this petition the members were made to\r\ncomplain that the clergy enacted laws and statutes in Convocation\r\nwithout consulting the king or the Commons, that suitors were treated\r\nharshly before the ecclesiastical courts, that in regard to probates\r\nthe people were worried by excessive fees and unnecessary delays, and\r\nthat the number of holidays was injurious to trade and agriculture.\r\nThis complaint was forwarded to Convocation for a reply. The bishops,\r\nwhile vindicating for the clergy the right to make their own laws and\r\nstatutes, showed themselves not unwilling to accept a compromise, but\r\nParliament at the instigation of Henry refused to accept their\r\nproposals. The king, who was determined to crush the power of the\r\nclergy, insisted that Convocation should abandon its right to make\r\nconstitutions or ordinances without royal permission, and that the\r\nordinances passed already should be submitted to a mixed commission\r\nappointed by the authority of the crown. Such proposals, so contrary\r\nto the customs of the realm and so destructive of the independence of\r\nthe Church, could not fail to be extremely disagreeable to the\r\nbishops; but in face of the uncompromising attitude of the king they\r\nwere forced to give way, and in a document known as the /Submission of\r\nthe Clergy/ they sacrificed the legislative rights of Convocation (May\r\n1532). They agreed to enact no new canons, constitutions or ordinances\r\nwithout the king's consent, that those already passed should be\r\nsubmitted to a committee consisting of clergy and laymen nominated by\r\nthe king, and that the laws adopted by this committee and approved by\r\nthe king should continue in full force. Sir Thomas More, who had\r\nworked hard in defence of the Church, promptly resigned his office of\r\nLord Chancellor that he might have a freer hand in the crisis that had\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nIn March 1532 another step was taken to overawe the Roman court and\r\nforce the Pope to yield to Henry's demands. An Act was passed\r\nabolishing the Annats or First Fruits paid to Rome by all bishops on\r\ntheir appointment to vacant Sees. If the Pope should refuse to appoint\r\nwithout such payments, it was enacted that the consecration should be\r\ncarried out by the archbishop of the province without further recourse\r\nto Rome. Such a measure, tending so directly towards schism, met with\r\nstrong opposition in the House of Lords from the bishops, abbots, and\r\nmany of the lay lords, as it did also in the House of Commons. In the\r\nend, it was passed only on the understanding that it should not take\r\neffect for a year, and that in the meantime if an agreement could be\r\narrived at with the Pope, the king might by letters patent repeal it.\r\nHenry instructed his ambassador at Rome to inform Clement VII. that\r\nthis legislation against Annats was entirely the work of the\r\nParliament, and that if the Pope wished for its withdrawal he must\r\nshow a more conciliatory spirit towards the king and people of\r\nEngland.[21]\r\n\r\nThe Pope, however, refused to yield to such intimidation. When news\r\narrived at Rome that Henry had sent away Catharine from court, the\r\nquestion of excommunication was considered, but as the excommunication\r\nof a king was likely to be fraught with such serious consequences for\r\nthe English Church, Clement VII. hesitated to publish it in the hope\r\nthat Henry might see the error of his ways. The trial was delayed from\r\ntime to time until at last in November 1532 the Pope addressed a\r\nstrong letter to the king, warning him under threat of excommunication\r\nto put away Anne Boleyn, and not to attempt to divorce Catharine or to\r\nmarry another until a decision had been given in Rome.[22] By this\r\ntime the king had given up all hope of securing the approval of Rome\r\nfor the step he contemplated. Even in England the divorce from\r\nCatharine found much opposition from both clergy and laity. Sir Thomas\r\nMore and many of the nobles were on the side of Catharine, as were\r\nalso Bishop Fisher of Rochester and Bishop Tunstall of Durham. Even\r\nReginald Pole, the king's own cousin, who had been educated at Henry's\r\nexpense, and for whom the Archbishopric of York had been kept vacant,\r\nrefused the tempting offers that were made to him on condition that he\r\nwould espouse the cause of separation. He preferred instead to leave\r\nEngland rather than act against his conscience by supporting\r\nCatherine's divorce.[23] Fortunately for Henry at this moment Warham,\r\nthe aged Archbishop of Canterbury, who was a stout defender of the\r\nHoly See,[24] passed away (Aug. 1532). The king determined to secure\r\nthe appointment of an archbishop upon whom he could rely for the\r\naccomplishment of his designs, and accordingly Thomas Cranmer was\r\nselected and presented to Rome. After much hesitation, and merely as\r\nthe lesser of two evils, his appointment was confirmed.\r\n\r\nThomas Cranmer was born in Nottingham, and educated in Cambridge. He\r\nmarried early in life, but his wife having died within a few months,\r\nhe determined to take holy orders. His suggestion to submit the\r\nvalidity of Henry's marriage to the judgment of the universities,\r\ncoming as it did at a time when Henry was at his wits' end, showed him\r\nto be a man of resource whose services should be secured by the court.\r\nHe was appointed accordingly chaplain to Anne Boleyn's father, and was\r\none of those sent on the embassy to meet the Pope and Charles V. at\r\nBologna. During his wanderings in Germany he was brought into close\r\nrelationship with many of the leading Reformers, and following their\r\nteaching and example he took to himself a wife in the person of the\r\nwell-known Lutheran divine, Osiander. Such a step, so highly\r\nobjectionable to the Church authorities and likely to be displeasing\r\nto Henry, who in spite of his own weakness insisted on clerical\r\ncelibacy, was kept a secret, though it is not at all improbable that\r\nthe secret had reached the ears of the king. At the time when the\r\nlatter had made up his mind to set Rome at defiance, he knew how\r\nimportant it was for him to sacrifice his own personal predilections,\r\nfor the sake of having a man of Cranmer's pliability as Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, and head of the clergy in England. On the 30th March,\r\n1533, Cranmer was consecrated archbishop, and took the usual oath of\r\nobedience and loyalty to the Pope; but immediately before the\r\nceremony, he registered a formal protest that he considered the oath a\r\nmere form, and that he wished to hold himself free to provide for the\r\nreformation of the Church in England.[25] Such a step indicates\r\nclearly enough the character of the first archbishop of the\r\nReformation in England.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the way for the sentence that might be published at any\r\nmoment by the Pope a bill was introduced forbidding appeals to Rome\r\nunder penalty of Praemunire, and declaring that all matrimonial suits\r\nshould be decided in England, and that the clergy should continue\r\ntheir ministrations in spite of any censures or interdicts that might\r\nbe promulgated by the Pope. The bill was accepted by the House of\r\nLords, but met with serious opposition in the Commons. An offer was\r\nmade to raise £200,000 for the king's use if only he would refer the\r\nwhole question to a General Council, but in the end, partly by threats\r\nand partly by deception regarding the attitude of the Pope and the\r\nEmperor, the opposition was induced to give way and the bill became\r\nlaw. By this Act it was declared that the realm of England should be\r\ngoverned by one supreme head and king, to whom both spirituality and\r\ntemporality were bound to yield, \"next to God a natural and humble\r\nobedience,\" that the English Church was competent to manage its own\r\naffairs without the interference of foreigners, and that all spiritual\r\ncases should be heard and determined by the king's jurisdiction and\r\nauthority.[26] The question of the divorce was brought before the\r\nConvocation in March 1533, and though Fisher spoke out boldly in\r\ndefence of Catharine's marriage, his brethren failed to support him,\r\nand Convocation declared against the legitimacy of the marriage.\r\n\r\nHenry was now free to throw off the mask. He could point to the\r\nverdict given in his favour by both Parliament and Convocation, and\r\ncould rely on Cranmer as Archbishop of Canterbury to carry out his\r\nwishes. In order to provide for the legitimacy of the child that was\r\nsoon to be born, he had married Anne Boleyn privately in January 1533.\r\nIn April Cranmer requested permission to be allowed to hold a court to\r\nconsider Henry's marriage with Catharine, to which request, inspired\r\nas it had been by himself, the king graciously assented. The court sat\r\nat Dunstable, where Catharine was cited to appear. On her refusal to\r\nplead she was condemned as contumacious. Sentence was given by the\r\narchbishop that her marriage with Henry was invalid (23rd April,\r\n1533). Cranmer next turned his attention to Henry's marriage with\r\nAnne, and as might be expected, this pliant minister had no difficulty\r\nin pronouncing in its favour. On Whit Sunday (1533) Anne was crowned\r\nas queen in Westminster Abbey. The popular feeling in London and\r\nthroughout the kingdom was decidedly hostile to the new queen and to\r\nthe French ambassador, who was blamed for taking sides against\r\nCatharine, but Henry was so confident of his own power that he was\r\nunmoved by the conduct of the London mob. In September, to the great\r\ndisappointment of the king who had been led by the astrologers and\r\nsorcerers to believe that he might expect the advent of an heir, a\r\ndaughter was born to whom was given the name Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe Pope, acting on the request of the French and English ambassadors,\r\nhad delayed to pronounce a definitive sentence, but the news of\r\nHenry's marriage with Anne and of the verdict that had been\r\npromulgated by the Archbishop of Canterbury made it imperative that\r\ndecisive measures should be taken. On the 11th July it was decreed\r\nthat Henry's divorce from Catharine and his marriage with Anne were\r\nnull and void.[27] Sentence of excommunication against him was\r\nprepared, but its publication was postponed till September, when an\r\ninterview had been arranged to take place between the Pope and Francis\r\nI. Francis I. was not without hope even still that an amicable\r\nsettlement could be arranged. Throughout the whole proceedings he had\r\nespoused warmly Henry's cause, in the belief that England, having\r\nbroken completely with Catharine's nephew Charles V., might be forced\r\nto conclude an alliance with France; but he never wished that Henry\r\nVIII. should set the Holy See at defiance, or that England should be\r\nseparated from the Catholic Church. To the Pope and to Henry he had\r\naddressed his remonstrances and petitions in turn, but events had\r\nreached such a climax that mediation was almost an impossibility. The\r\ninterview arranged between the Pope and Francis I. took place at\r\nMarseilles in October 1533. Regardless of all the rules of diplomatic\r\ncourtesy and of good manners, Henry's representative forced his way\r\ninto the presence of the Pope, and announced to him that the King of\r\nEngland had appealed from the verdict of Rome to the judgment of a\r\nGeneral Council. Notices of this appeal were posted up in London, and\r\npreachers were ordered to declaim against the authority of the Pope,\r\nwho was to be styled henceforth Bishop of Rome, and whose sentences\r\nand excommunications, the people were to be informed, were of no\r\ngreater importance than those of any other foreign bishop. The way was\r\nnow open for the final act of separation.\r\n\r\nParliament met in January 1534. The law passed the previous year\r\nagainst the payment of annats was now promulgated. According to this\r\nAct the Pope was not to be consulted for the future regarding\r\nappointments to English Sees. When a bishopric became vacant, the\r\nchapter having received the /Congé d'élire/ should proceed to elect\r\nthe person named in the royal letters accompanying the /Congé/, and\r\nthe person so elected should be presented to the metropolitan for\r\nconsecration. In case of a metropolitan See, the archbishop-elect\r\nshould be consecrated by another metropolitan and two bishops or by\r\nfour bishops appointed by the crown. Another Act was passed forbidding\r\nthe payment of Peter's Pence and all other fees and pensions paid\r\nformerly to Rome. The Archbishop of Canterbury was empowered to grant\r\ndispensations, and the penalties of Praemunire were levelled against\r\nall persons who should apply for faculties to the Pope. By a third Act\r\na prohibition against appeals to Rome was renewed, although it was\r\npermitted to appeal from the court of the Archbishop of Canterbury to\r\nthe king's Court of Chancery. Convocation was forbidden to enact any\r\nnew ordinances without the consent of the king, and those passed\r\nalready were to be subject to revision by a royal commission. Finally,\r\nan Act was passed vesting the succession in the children of Henry and\r\nAnne to the exclusion of the Princess Mary. The marriage with\r\nCatharine was declared null and void by Parliament on the ground\r\nprincipally that no man could dispense with God's law, and to prevent\r\nsuch incestuous unions in the future a list of the forbidden degrees\r\nwas drawn up, and ordered to be exhibited in the public churches. To\r\nquestion the marriage of Henry with Anne Boleyn by writing, word,\r\ndeed, or act was declared to be high treason, and all persons should\r\ntake an oath acknowledging the succession under pain of misprision of\r\ntreason. That the Parliament was forced to adopt these measures\r\nagainst its own better judgment is clear from the small number of\r\nmembers who took their seats in the House of Lords, as well as from\r\nthe fact that some of the Commoners assured the imperial ambassador\r\nthat were his master to invade England he might count on considerable\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIn Rome the agents of Francis I., fearing that an alliance between\r\nFrance and England would be impossible were Henry to throw off his\r\nallegiance to the Church, moved heaven and earth to prevent a\r\ndefinitive sentence. The fact that the Emperor was both unable and\r\nunwilling to enforce the decision of the Pope, and that instead of\r\ndesiring the excommunication and deposition of Henry he was opposed to\r\nsuch a step, made it more difficult for the Pope to take decisive\r\nmeasures. Finally after various consultations with the cardinals,\r\nsentence was given declaring the marriage with Catharine valid and the\r\nchildren born of that marriage legitimate (23rd March, 1534). When the\r\nnews of this decision reached England Henry was alarmed. He feared\r\nthat the Emperor might declare war at any moment, that an imperial\r\narmy might be landed on the English shores, and that Francis I.\r\nyielding to the entreaties of the Pope might make common cause with\r\nthe imperialists. Orders were given to strengthen the fortifications,\r\nand to hold the fleet in readiness. Agents were dispatched to secure\r\nthe neutrality of France, and preachers were commanded to denounce the\r\nBishop of Rome. As matters stood, however, there was no need for such\r\nalarm. The Emperor had enough to engage his attention in Spain and\r\nGermany, and the enmity between Charles V. and the King of France was\r\ntoo acute to prevent them from acting together even in defence of\r\ntheir common religion.\r\n\r\nMeantime it was clear to Henry that popular feeling was strong against\r\nhis policy, but instead of being deterred by this, he became more\r\nobstinate and determined to show the people that his wishes must be\r\nobeyed. A nun named Elizabeth Barton, generally known as the \"Nun of\r\nKent,\" claimed to have been favoured with special visions from on\r\nhigh. She denounced the king's marriage with Anne, and bewailed the\r\nspread of heresy in the kingdom. People flocked from all parts to\r\ninterview her, and even Cranmer pretended to be impressed by her\r\nstatements. She and many of her principal supporters were arrested and\r\ncondemned to death (Nov. 1534). It was hoped that by her confession it\r\nmight be possible to placate Bishop Fisher, who was specially hated by\r\nHenry on account of the stand he had made on the question of the\r\nmarriage, and the late Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More. Both had met\r\nthe nun, but had been careful to avoid everything that could be\r\nconstrued even remotely as treason. In the Act of Attainder introduced\r\ninto Parliament against Elizabeth Barton and her confederates, the\r\nnames of Fisher and More were included, but so strong was the feeling\r\nin More's favour that his name was erased. Fisher, although able to\r\nclear himself from all reasonable grounds of suspicion, was found\r\nguilty of misprision of treason and condemned to pay a fine of £300.\r\nFisher and More were then called upon to take the oath of succession,\r\nwhich, as drawn up, included, together with an acknowledgement of the\r\nlegitimacy of the children born of Henry and Anne, a repudiation of\r\nthe primacy of the Pope, and of the validity of Henry's marriage with\r\nCatharine. Both were willing to accept the succession as fixed by Act\r\nof Parliament, but neither of them could accept the other\r\npropositions. They were arrested therefore and lodged in the Tower\r\n(April 1534).\r\n\r\nCommissions were appointed to minister the oath to the clergy and\r\nlaity, most of whom accepted it, some through fear of the consequences\r\nof refusal and others in the hope of receiving a share of the monastic\r\nlands, which, it was rumoured, would soon be at the disposal of the\r\nking. A royal commission consisting of George Brown, Prior of the\r\nAugustinian Hermits, and Dr. Hilsey, Provincial of the Dominicans, was\r\nappointed to visit the religious houses and to obtain the submission\r\nof the members (April 1534). By threats of dissolution and\r\nconfiscation they secured the submission of most of the monastic\r\nestablishments with the exception of the Observants of Richmond and\r\nGreenwich and the Carthusians of the Charterhouse, London. Many of the\r\nmembers of these communities were arrested and lodged in the Tower,\r\nand the decree went forth that the seven houses belonging to the\r\nObservants, who had offered a strenuous opposition to the divorce,\r\nshould be suppressed.[28] The Convocations of Canterbury and York\r\nsubmitted, as did also the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met again in November 1534 a bill was introduced\r\nproclaiming the king supreme head of the Church in England. The\r\nmeasure was based upon the recognition of royal supremacy extracted\r\nfrom Convocation three years before, but with the omission of the\r\nsaving clause \"as far as the law of Christ allows.\" According to this\r\nAct it was declared that the king \"justly and rightly is and ought to\r\nbe the supreme head of the Church in England, and to enjoy all the\r\nhonours, dignities, pre-eminences, jurisdictions, privileges,\r\nauthorities, immunities, profits and commodities\" appertaining to the\r\ndignity of the supreme head of the Church.[29] An Act of Attainder was\r\npassed against Fisher, More, and all others who had refused\r\nsubmission. The First Fruits, formerly paid to the Pope, were to be\r\npaid to the king, and bishops were allowed to appoint men approved by\r\nthe crown to be their assistants.\r\n\r\nBy these measures the constitution of the Church, as it had been\r\naccepted for centuries by the English clergy and laity, was\r\noverturned. The authority of the Pope was rejected in favour of the\r\nauthority of the king, who was to be regarded in the future as the\r\nsource of all ecclesiastical jurisdiction. This great religious\r\nrevolution was carried out without the consent of the bishops and\r\nclergy. With the single exception of Cranmer the bishops to a man\r\nopposed the change, and if they and the great body of the clergy made\r\ntheir submission in the end, they did so not because they were\r\nconvinced by the royal arguments, but because they feared the royal\r\ndispleasure. Neither was the change favoured by any considerable\r\nsection of the nobles and people. The former were won over partly by\r\nfear, partly by hope of securing a share in the plunder of the Church;\r\nthe latter, dismayed by the cowardly attitude shown by their spiritual\r\nand lay leaders, saw no hope of successful resistance. Had there been\r\nany strong feeling in England against the Holy See, some of the\r\nbishops and clergy would have spoken out clearly against the Pope, at\r\na time when such a step would have merited the approval of the king.\r\nThe fact that the measure could have been passed in such circumstances\r\nis in itself the best example of what is meant by Tudor despotism, in\r\nthe days when an English Parliament was only a machine for registering\r\nthe wishes of the king.\r\n\r\nIn January 1535 an order was made that the king should be styled\r\nsupreme head of the Church of England. Thomas Cromwell, who had risen\r\nrapidly at court in spite of the disgrace of his patron, Cardinal\r\nWolsey, was entrusted with the work of forcing the clergy and laity to\r\nrenounce the authority of the Pope. The bishops were commanded to\r\nsurrender the Bulls of appointment they had received from Rome, and to\r\nacknowledge expressly that they recognised the royal supremacy.\r\nCromwell was appointed the king's vicar-general, from whom the bishops\r\nand archbishops were obliged to take their directions. Severe measures\r\nwere to be used against anybody who spoke even in private in favour of\r\nRome. The Prior of the London Charterhouse and some other Carthusians\r\nwere brought to trial for refusing to accept the royal supremacy\r\n(April, 1535). After an able and uncompromising defence they were\r\nfound guilty of treason and were put to death with the most revolting\r\ncruelty.[30] Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More, who were prisoners in\r\nthe Tower, were allowed some time to consider their course of conduct.\r\nFisher declared that he could not acknowledge the king as supreme head\r\nof the Church. While he lay in prison awaiting his trial, Paul III.,\r\nin acknowledgment of his loyal services to the Church, conferred on\r\nhim a cardinal's hat. This honour, however well merited, served only\r\nto arouse the ire of the king. He declared that by the time the hat\r\nshould arrive Fisher should have no head on which to wear it, and to\r\nshow that this was no idle threat a peremptory order was dispatched\r\nthat unless Fisher and More took the oath before the feast of St. John\r\nthey should suffer the penalty prescribed for traitors. Fisher,\r\ntogether with some monks of the Carthusians, was brought to trial\r\n(June 1535), and was found guilty of treason for having declared that\r\nthe king was not supreme head of the Church. The prisoners were\r\ncondemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. In the case of the\r\nCarthusians the sentence was carried out to the letter, but as it was\r\nfeared that Fisher might die before he reached Tyburn he was beheaded\r\nin the Tower (22nd June), and his head was impaled on London\r\nbridge.[31]\r\n\r\nSir Thomas More was placed on his trial in Westminster Hall before a\r\nspecial commission (1st July). Able lawyer as he was, he had no\r\ndifficulty in showing that by silence he had committed no crime and\r\nbroken no Act of Parliament, but no defence could avail him against\r\nthe wishes of the king. The jury promptly returned a verdict of\r\nguilty. Before sentence was passed the prisoner spoke out manfully\r\nagainst royal supremacy, and in defence of the authority of Rome. He\r\ndeclared that the Act of Parliament, which conferred on the king the\r\ntitle of supreme head of the Church, was opposed both to the laws of\r\nGod and man, that it was in flagrant contradiction to the Magna\r\nCharta, and that the king of England could no more refuse obedience to\r\nthe Holy See than a child could refuse obedience to his father. Even\r\nafter his trial and condemnation another attempt was made to induce\r\nhim to submit, but he refused, and on the 6th July he finished his\r\ncareer as a martyr for Rome.[32]\r\n\r\nThe execution of Fisher and More showed plainly to all that the breach\r\nwith Rome was not likely to be healed. When news of what had taken\r\nplace in England reached Rome Paul III. was anxious to issue a decree\r\nof deposition against Henry. Had he done so, and had he been supported\r\nby the Emperor and Francis I. there is no doubt that many of the\r\nEnglish noblemen would have joined the standard of the invaders, but\r\nthe hostility between France and the Emperor saved Henry. Neither\r\nparty was willing to aid the Pope lest the other should form an\r\nalliance with England. Fearing such a union, however, between Francis\r\nI. and Charles V. Henry hastened to seek the aid of the Protestant\r\nprinces of Germany. From 1531 he had been in communication with them\r\nurging them to be careful about introducing religious innovations, but\r\nhe was now so alarmed lest the Emperor and the King of France might\r\njoin hands to assist the Pope in convoking a General Council, that\r\nEnglish envoys were directed to meet the Protestant princes at\r\nSchmalkald (1535), to arrange for common action. A close union between\r\nEngland and the Protestant states of Germany could not be effected,\r\nbecause the Protestant princes insisted that Henry should accept the\r\nConfession of Augsburg, and Henry refused to permit such interference\r\nin the religious affairs of England. Still, English divines were\r\ninstructed to remain at Wittenberg, and Lutheran theologians were\r\ninvited to come to England for the discussion of religious\r\ndifferences.[33]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cromwell was engaged in a visitation of the monasteries of\r\nEngland (1535). To bring home to the minds of the bishops the meaning\r\nof royal supremacy, he suspended their visitations while the royal\r\nvisitors were at work. Cromwell, unable to undertake the duty himself,\r\nappointed delegates, and supplied them with the list of questions that\r\nshould be administered. His principal delegates were Richard Leyton\r\nand Thomas Leigh, both men, as is evident from their own letters, who\r\nwere not likely to be over scrupulous about the methods they employed.\r\nThey were harsh, rude, and brutal in their treatment of both monks and\r\nnuns, especially in houses where they suspected hostility to the\r\nrecent laws. They used every means in their power to break up the\r\nharmony of religious life, and to unsettle the minds of the younger\r\nmembers of the communities. In a few months the visitations were\r\nfinished, and the reports of the visitors were presented to Cromwell.\r\nAccording to these reports most of the monasteries and convents were\r\nhomes of sin and vice, and many of the monks and nuns were guilty of\r\nheinous crimes, but, though in particular instances there may have\r\nbeen some grounds for these charges, there is good reason for not\r\naccepting as trustworthy this account of monastic discipline. In the\r\nfirst place the royal visitors traversed the country with such\r\nlightning-like rapidity that it would have been impossible for them to\r\narrive at a correct judgment even had they been impartial and honest\r\nmen. That they were neither honest nor impartial is clear enough from\r\ntheir own correspondence. They were sent out by Cromwell to collect\r\nevidence that might furnish a decent pretext for suppressing the\r\nmonasteries and for confiscating the monastic possessions, and they\r\ntook pains to show their master that his confidence in them had not\r\nbeen misplaced. Their only mistake was that in their eagerness to\r\nblack the character of the unfortunate religious they exceeded the\r\nlimits of human credulity. They positively revelled in sin, and the\r\nscandals they reported were of such a gross and hideous kind that it\r\nis impossible to believe that they could have been true, else the\r\npeople, instead of taking up arms to defend the religious houses,\r\nwould have risen in revolt to suppress such abominations. Nor is it\r\ncorrect to say that the /Comperta/ were submitted to Parliament for\r\ndiscussion, and that the members were so shocked by the tale they\r\nunfolded that they clamoured for the suppression of these iniquitous\r\ninstitutions. There is abundant evidence to prove that Parliament was\r\nreluctant to take any action against the religious houses, that it was\r\nonly by the personal intervention of the king that the bill for the\r\nsuppression of the lesser monasteries was allowed to pass, and that it\r\nis at least doubtful if any but general statements founded on the\r\n/Comperta/ were brought before Parliament. The story of the production\r\nof the \"Black Book\" supposed to contain the reports is of a much later\r\ndate, and comes from sources that could not be regarded as\r\nunprejudiced. It had its origin probably in a misunderstanding of the\r\nnature of the /Compendium Compertorum/, which dealt only with parishes\r\nof the northern province. It is strange that though the commissioners\r\nmade no distinction between the condition of the larger and the\r\nsmaller monasteries, the Act of Parliament based upon these reports\r\ndecreed only the suppression of the smaller monasteries, as if vice\r\nand neglect of discipline were more likely to reign in the small\r\nrather than in the larger communities; and it is equally strange that\r\nthe superiors of many of the houses, about which unfavourable reports\r\nhad been presented, were promoted to high ecclesiastical offices by\r\nthe king and by his vicar-general, who should have been convinced of\r\nthe guilt and unworthiness of such ministers, had they trusted their\r\nown commissioners. In the case of some of the dioceses, as for example\r\nNorwich, it is possible to compare the results of an episcopal\r\nvisitation held some years previously with the reports of Cromwell's\r\ncommissioners, and though it is sufficiently clear from these earlier\r\nreports that all was not well with discipline, the discrepancy between\r\nthe accounts of the bishops and the royal commissioners is so\r\nstriking, that it is difficult to believe that the houses could have\r\ndegenerated so rapidly in so short a space of time as to justify the\r\n/Comperta/ of the commissioners. But what is still more striking is\r\nthe fact that after the decree of suppression had gone forth, other\r\ncommissioners, drawn largely from the local gentry, many of whom were\r\nto share in the plunder of the monastic lands, visited several of the\r\nhouses against which serious charges had been made, and found nothing\r\nworthy of special blame. These men were not likely to be prejudiced in\r\nfavour of the monks and nuns. They were well acquainted with the\r\npeople of the district, and had every opportunity of learning the\r\nverdict of the masses about the discipline of the religious\r\ncommunities. They were, therefore, in a much better position to arrive\r\nat the truth than the royal commissioners who could only pay a flying\r\nvisit of a few hours or at most of a few days.[34]\r\n\r\nThe real object of the visitation and of the scandalous reports to\r\nwhich it gave rise, was to secure some specious pretext that would\r\njustify the king in the eyes of the nation in suppressing the\r\nmonasteries and in confiscating their possessions. The idea that the\r\nmonastic establishments enjoyed only the administration of their lands\r\nand goods, and that these might be seized upon at any moment for the\r\npublic weal, was not entirely a new one either in the history of\r\nEngland or in that of some of the Continental countries. Years before,\r\nCardinal Wolsey, for example, had dissolved more than twenty\r\nmonasteries in order to raise funds for his colleges at Ipswich and\r\nOxford, while not unfrequently the kings of England rewarded their\r\nfavourites and servants by granting them a pension to be paid by a\r\nparticular monastery. With the rise of the middle classes to power and\r\nthe gradual awakening of greater agricultural and commercial activity,\r\ngreedy eyes were turned to the monasteries and the farms owned by the\r\nreligious institutions. Unlike the property of private individuals\r\nthese lands were never likely to be in the market, and humanly\r\nspeaking a transfer of ownership could be effected only by a violent\r\nrevolution. Many people, therefore, though not unfriendly to the monks\r\nand nuns as such, were not disinclined to entertain the proposals of\r\nthe king for the confiscation of religious property, particularly as\r\nhopes were held out to the nobles, wealthy merchants, and the\r\ncorporations of cities and towns that the property so acquired could\r\ntake the place of the taxes that otherwise must be raised to meet\r\nlocal and national expenditure.\r\n\r\nFor months before Parliament met (Feb. 1536) everything that could be\r\ndone by means of violent pamphlets and sermons against the monks and\r\nthe Papacy was done to prepare the country for the extreme measures\r\nthat were in contemplation. The king came in person to warn the House\r\nof Commons that the reports of the royal commissioners, showing as\r\nthey did the wretched condition of the monasteries and convents called\r\nfor nothing less than the total dissolution of such institutions. The\r\nmembers do not appear, however, to have been satisfied with the king's\r\nrecommendations, and it was probably owing to their feared opposition\r\nto a wholesale sacrifice of the monasteries that, though the\r\ncommissioners had made no distinction between the larger and the\r\nsmaller establishments the measure introduced by the government dealt\r\nonly with the houses possessing a yearly revenue of less than £200.\r\nEven in this mild form great pressure was required to secure the\r\npassage of the Act, for though here and there complaints might have\r\nbeen heard against the enclosures of monastic lands or about the\r\ncompetition of the clerics in secular pursuits, the great body of the\r\npeople were still warmly attached to the monasteries. Once the decree\r\nof dissolution had been passed the work of suppression was begun.\r\nClose on four hundred religious houses were dissolved, and their lands\r\nand property confiscated to the crown. The monks and nuns to the\r\nnumber of about 2,000 were left homeless and dependent merely on the\r\nmiserable pensions, which not unfrequently remained unpaid. Their\r\ngoods and valuables including the church plate and libraries were\r\nseized. Their houses were dismantled, and the roofless walls were left\r\nstanding or disposed of as quarries for the sale of stones.[35] Such\r\ncruel measures were resented by the masses of the people, who were\r\nattached to the monasteries, and who had always found the monks and\r\nnuns obliging neighbours, generous to their servants and their\r\ntenants, charitable to the poor and the wayfarer, good instructors of\r\nthe youth, and deeply interested in the temporal as well as in the\r\nspiritual welfare of those around them. In London and the south-\r\neastern counties, where the new tendencies had taken a firmer root, a\r\nstrong minority supported the policy of the king and Cromwell, but\r\nthroughout England generally, from Cornwall and Devon to the Scottish\r\nborders, the vast majority of the English people objected to the\r\nreligious innovations, detested Cromwell and Cranmer as heretics,\r\nlooked to Mary as the lawful heir to the throne in spite of the\r\ndecision of the court of Dunstable, and denounced the attacks on the\r\nmonasteries as robbery and sacrilege. The excitement spread quickly,\r\nespecially amongst the peasants, and soon news reached London that a\r\nformidable rebellion had begun in the north.\r\n\r\nIn October 1536 the men of Lincoln took up arms in defence of their\r\nreligion. Many of the noblemen were forced to take part in the\r\nmovement, with which they sympathised, but which they feared to join\r\nlest they should be exposed to the merciless vengeance of the king.\r\nThe leaders proclaimed their loyalty to the crown, and announced their\r\nintention of sending agents to London to present their petitions. They\r\ndemanded the restoration of the monasteries, the removal of heretical\r\nbishops such as Cranmer and Latimer, and the dismissal of evil\r\nadvisers like Cromwell and Rich. Henry VIII. returned a determined\r\nrefusal to their demands, and dispatched the Earl of Shrewsbury and\r\nthe Duke of Suffolk to suppress the rebellion. The people were quite\r\nprepared to fight, but the noblemen opened negotiations with the\r\nking's commanders, and advised the insurgents to disperse. The Duke of\r\nSuffolk entered the city of Lincoln amidst every sign of popular\r\ndispleasure, although since the leaders had grown fainthearted no\r\nresistance was offered. Those who had taken a prominent part in the\r\nrebellion were arrested and put to death; the oath of supremacy was\r\ntendered to every adult; and by the beginning of April 1537, all\r\ntraces of the rebellion had been removed.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrimage of Grace in the north was destined to prove a much more\r\ndangerous movement. Early in October 1536 the people of York,\r\ndetermined to resist, and by the middle of the month the whole country\r\nwas up in arms under the leadership of Robert Aske, a country\r\ngentleman and a lawyer well-known in legal services in London. Soon\r\nthe movement spread through most of the counties of the north. York\r\nwas surrendered to the insurgents without a struggle. Pomfret Castle,\r\nwhere the Archbishop of York and many of the nobles had fled for\r\nrefuge, was obliged to capitulate, and Lord Darcy, the most loyal\r\nsupporter of the king in the north, agreed to join the party of Aske.\r\nHull opened its gates to the rebels, and before the end of October a\r\nwell trained army of close on 40,000 men led by the principal\r\ngentlemen of the north lay encamped four miles north of Doncaster,\r\nwhere the Duke of Norfolk at the head of 8,000 of the king's troops\r\nawaited the attack. The Duke, fully conscious of the inferiority of\r\nhis forces and well aware that he could not count on the loyalty of\r\nhis own soldiers, many of whom favoured the demands of the rebels,\r\ndetermined to gain time by opening negotiations for a peaceful\r\nsettlement (27th Oct.). Two messengers were dispatched to submit their\r\ngrievances to the king, and it was agreed that until an answer should\r\nbe received both parties should observe the truce. The king met the\r\ndemands for the maintenance of the old faith, the restoration of the\r\nliberties of the Church, and the dismissal of ministers like Cromwell\r\nby a long explanation and defence of his political and religious\r\npolicy, and the messengers returned to announce that the Duke of\r\nNorfolk was coming for another conference. Many of the leaders argued\r\nthat the time for peaceful remonstrances had passed, and that the\r\nissue could be decided now only by the sword. Had their advice been\r\nacted upon the results might have been disastrous for the king, but\r\nthe extreme loyalty of both the leaders and people, and the fear that\r\ncivil war in England would lead to a new Scottish invasion, determined\r\nthe majority to exhaust peaceful means before having recourse to\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nAn interview between the leaders and the Duke of Norfolk, representing\r\nthe king, was arranged to take place at Doncaster (5th Dec.). In the\r\nmeantime a convocation of the clergy was called to meet at Pomfret to\r\nformulate the religious grievances, and a lay assembly to draw up the\r\ndemands of the people. Both clergy and people insisted on the\r\nacceptance of papal supremacy, the restoration of all clergy who had\r\nbeen deposed for resisting royal supremacy, the destruction of\r\nheretical books, such as those written by Luther, Hus, Melanchthon,\r\nTundale, Barnes, and St. German, the dismissal of heretical bishops\r\nand advisers such as Cromwell, and the re-establishment of religious\r\nhouses. Face to face with such demands, backed as they were by an army\r\nof 40,000 men, Norfolk, fearing that resistance was impossible, had\r\nrecourse to a dishonest strategy. He promised the rebels that a free\r\nParliament would be held at York to discuss their grievances, that a\r\nfull pardon would be granted to all who had taken up arms, and that in\r\nthe meantime the monks and nuns would be supported from the revenues\r\nof the surrendered monasteries and convents. Aske, whose weak point\r\nhad always been his extreme loyalty, agreed to these terms, and\r\nordered his followers to disband. He was invited to attend in London\r\nfor a conference with the king, and returned home to announce that\r\nHenry was coming to open the Parliament at York, and that the people\r\nmight rely with confidence on the royal promises. But signs were not\r\nwanting to show that the insurgents had been betrayed, and that they\r\nmust expect vengeance rather than redress. Soon it was rumoured that\r\nHull and Scarborough were being strengthened, and that in both cities\r\nHenry intended to place royal garrisons. The people, alarmed by the\r\ndangers that threatened them, attempted vainly to seize these two\r\ntowns, and throughout the north various risings took place. The Duke\r\nof Norfolk, taking advantage of this violation of the truce, and\r\nhaving no longer any strong forces to contend with, promptly\r\nsuppressed these rebellions, proclaimed martial law, and began a\r\ncampaign of wholesale butchery. Hundreds of the rebels, including\r\nabbots and priests, who were suspected of favouring the insurgents,\r\nwere put to death. The leaders, Aske, Lord Darcy, Lord Hussey, Sir\r\nThomas Percy, Sir Francis Bigod, together with the abbots of Jervaux\r\nand of Fountains, and the Prior of Bidlington were arrested. Some of\r\nthem suffered the penalty of death in London, while others were sent\r\nback to be executed in their own districts. By these measures the\r\nrebellion was suppressed in the north, and the rest of the counties\r\nwere intimidated into submission.[36]\r\n\r\nHad the Emperor decided upon supporting the people of the north the\r\ncourse of English history might have been different, but as war had\r\nbroken out once more between France and the empire, both nations,\r\nanxious to maintain good relations with England, abstained from active\r\ninterference in English affairs. Pope Paul III., deeply interested as\r\nhe was in the English revolution, summoned to his assistance one who\r\nunderstood better than most of his contemporaries the character of the\r\nking and the condition of the country, namely, Reginald Pole. The\r\nlatter, turning his back on the favour of the king and the offer of\r\nthe Archbishopric of York, had left England rather than approve of the\r\nking's separation from Catharine. Henry, however, hoping to induce him\r\nto return to England, maintained friendly relations with Pole, and\r\nrequested him to state frankly his views on royal supremacy. Pole\r\nreplied in a long treatise afterwards published under the title /Pro\r\necclesiasticae unitatis Defensione/ (1536), in which he reproved the\r\nconduct of the king, and warned him of the dangers that his religious\r\npolicy might involve. Henry, though deeply mortified by the substance\r\nand tone of this work, pretended not to be displeased, and in the hope\r\nof silencing his distinguished kinsman whom he now both feared and\r\nhated he urged him to come back to England. Pole's mother and brothers\r\nbesought him to yield to the royal wishes, or else he should prove the\r\nruin of all those who were dear to him. Though deeply affected by\r\ntheir appeals, he preferred duty to family affection. He went to Rome\r\nwhere he was created a cardinal (1536), and appointed to assist in\r\ndrawing up a scheme of ecclesiastical reforms in preparation for the\r\nGeneral Council. Soon news arrived in Rome that a rebellion had broken\r\nout in England, that the people were ready to die in defence of their\r\nreligion, and that the king might be forced to adopt a more\r\nconciliatory attitude towards Rome. It was decided to appoint Cardinal\r\nPole papal legate, and to send him to England. Such an appointment\r\ncoming at such a time filled Henry with alarm. He feared that James V.\r\nof Scotland might be induced to lead an army across the borders to the\r\nassistance of the northern rebels, and that France and the Emperor\r\nmight unite their forces against one who was regarded by both as\r\nlittle less than a heretic. He induced the privy council to address a\r\nletter to the cardinal (Jan. 1537) reproaching him for his ingratitude\r\nand disloyalty to the king, and inviting him to come to Flanders for a\r\nfriendly discussion with the English agents. Before the legate could\r\nleave Italy the Pilgrimage of Grace had been suppressed, and all hope\r\nof a successful mission in England was lost. He passed through France\r\nand Flanders, where he received a very cool reception from Francis I.\r\nand the regent of the Netherlands, both of whom had been requested to\r\ndeliver him to Henry VIII. After a short stay in the territory of the\r\nPrince-bishop of Liège he returned to Rome in August 1537.[37]\r\n\r\nBut though the rebellion in the north had been suppressed, it was\r\nsufficiently grave to show Henry the danger incurred at home by\r\nreligious innovations, while the legatine mission of Cardinal Pole\r\nmade it advisable to prove to the Catholic rulers of Europe that\r\nEngland had not gone over to the Lutheran camp. The greatest\r\nobjection taken by the conservative party in England to the /Ten\r\nArticles/, drawn up by the king and accepted by Convocation in the\r\nprevious year (1536), was the absence of express reference to any\r\nSacrament except Baptism, Penance, and the Eucharist. At the meeting\r\nof Convocation (1537) the battle was waged between the Catholic-minded\r\nbishops let by Tunstall of Durham and the Lutheran party let by\r\nCranmer. At last the other four Sacraments were \"found again,\" and a\r\nsettlement agreeable to both parties arrived at and embodied in a\r\ntreatise known as /The Institution of a Christian Man/. It consisted\r\nof four parts, the Apostle's Creed, the Seven Sacraments, the Ten\r\nCommandments, and the Our Father and Hail Mary. Two separate articles\r\ndealing with justification and purgatory taken from the Ten Articles\r\npreviously issued were appended. The bishops submitted /The\r\nInstitution/ to the judgment of the king, inviting him as supreme head\r\nof the Church to correct whatever was amiss with their doctrine, but\r\nHenry, anxious to hold himself free to bargain with the Lutheran\r\nprinces if necessary, refused to take any responsibility for the work\r\nbeyond ordering that it might be read in the churches for three years.\r\nHence it was called the /Bishop's Book/.[38]\r\n\r\nAgainst this and as a concession to the reforming party in England\r\nHenry was pleased to approve of a translation of the Bible presented\r\nto him by Cranmer, and to order copies of it to be provided for the\r\nuse of the faithful in every parish church (1537-38). William Tyndale,\r\nwho had fled from England to Wittenberg, set himself to complete a\r\ntranslation of the Bible, which translation was published and smuggled\r\ninto England in 1526. The translation was in itself bristling with\r\nerrors, and the marginal notes were stupidly offensive. The bishops\r\nmade desperate attempts to secure its suppression, but despite their\r\nefforts the obnoxious translation and even many of the more\r\nobjectionable works written by the same author continued to find their\r\nway into England. The king, though nominally supporting the bishops,\r\nwas not sorry that such works should be spread amongst the people, as\r\na warning to the Pope of the consequences of a refusal to comply with\r\nthe royal wishes. In 1530, however, he took counsel with the bishops\r\nand learned men to see what might be done to procure a good English\r\ntranslation of the Bible. They agreed that the reading of an English\r\nversion of the Bible was not necessary for salvation, that, though the\r\nScriptures in the vulgar tongue might be useful in certain\r\ncircumstances and for certain people, they were more likely to be\r\nharmful at a time when erroneous books and heretical books were being\r\npropagated. Furthermore they advised that a proper correct translation\r\nshould be made and placed in the king's hands, so that he might order\r\nits publication whenever he thought that a favourable moment had\r\narrived for such a work.\r\n\r\nCromwell was, however, determined to push forward the new religious\r\nteachings. He was in close correspondence with an apostate Augustinian\r\nfriar named Coverdale, who had been obliged to leave the country on\r\naccount of his heretical opinions. At Cromwell's instigation Coverdale\r\nset himself to prepare a new translation of the Bible, and it was\r\ncompleted and published about 1535. Unlike that of Tyndale, who had\r\ngone to the Greek and Hebrew originals, Coverdale's Bible was made\r\nfrom the Vulgate with the aid of the German Lutheran translation. It\r\nwas if anything even more objectionable than Tyndale's, but Cromwell\r\nintended to force it upon the clergy in the /Injunctions/ drawn up for\r\ntheir guidance in 1536, though apparently on further consideration he\r\ndoubted the prudence of such a step, and the clause regarding the\r\nEnglish Bible was omitted.[39] In 1537 Cranmer presented the English\r\nBible to Cromwell for approval. It was supposed to contain \"the Old\r\nand New Testament, truly and purely translated into English by Thomas\r\nMatthew,\" but in reality it was only a compilation of the works of\r\nTyndale and Coverdale made by one John Rogers. Though very\r\nobjectionable from the point of view of Catholic doctrine it was\r\napproved by Cromwell as vicar-general, and copies were ordered to be\r\nplaced in every church (1538). Nearly two years later Coverdale's\r\n\"Great Bible\" with a preface by Cranmer was published.[40]\r\n\r\nThe results of the free use of such translations were soon apparent in\r\nthe religious discussions that took place in many parts of England.\r\nHenry began to fear that he had acted unwisely in allowing the people\r\nto make their religion for themselves, and besides, as Cromwell had\r\nfallen, the conservative bishops like Gardiner of Winchester were in\r\nthe ascendant. In the Convocation of 1542 grave objections were raised\r\nagainst these various translations, and with the approval of the king\r\nit was resolved to undertake a revision of them; but while the\r\ncommittee appointed for this revision was at work, a messenger arrived\r\nfrom the king forbidding Convocation to proceed further, as His\r\nMajesty had decided to take the matter out of the hands of the bishops\r\nand submit it to the universities. The bishops protested against this\r\norder, but their protests were unheeded, and an English Bible, that\r\nhad been condemned by Convocation, was forced on the clergy and people\r\nagainst the advice of the ecclesiastical authorities. In 1543,\r\nhowever, an Act was passed in Parliament at the request of the king\r\nforbidding private individuals to take it upon themselves to interpret\r\nthe Bible in any public assembly; noblemen, gentlemen householders,\r\nand even merchants might retain the English translation and read it,\r\nbut this favour was denied to the lower classes \"unless the king\r\nperceiving their lives to be amended by the doctrines he had set forth\r\nthought fit to give them liberty to read it.\"[41]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1536 Queen Catharine died. Her heart had been broken by the\r\nconduct of the king and by separation from her daughter the Princess\r\nMary. Time and again she had been commanded under threat of the\r\nseverest punishment to accept the sentence of Cranmer's court, but\r\nboth herself and the Princess refused steadfastly to subscribe to such\r\na dishonourable verdict. After Catharine's death and merely to save\r\nher life Mary signed a document agreeing to the abolition of papal\r\nsupremacy and the invalidity of her mother's marriage, though nobody\r\nattached any importance to a submission that was obtained in such\r\ncircumstances. The death of Catharine was a great relief to Henry and\r\nAnne, more especially to the latter, who had some reason for believing\r\nthat she herself had lost her hold on the affections of the king.\r\nHenry had already grown weary of the woman for whose sake he had put\r\nhis lawful wife away and separated his kingdom from the Catholic\r\nChurch, and the disappointment of his hopes for the birth of an heir\r\nto the throne confirmed his intention of ridding himself of a partner,\r\nwho was regarded by his own subjects and the nations of Europe only as\r\nhis concubine. She was arrested on a charge of misconduct with her\r\nbrother and other gentlemen of the court, was tried before a body of\r\nthe peers, and was put to death at Tyburn (17th May, 1536). Cranmer,\r\nwho in his heart was convinced of her innocence, promptly held a court\r\nand pronounced her marriage with Henry null and void. On the very day\r\nof her execution he issued a license for the king to marry Jane\r\nSeymour, one of Anne's maids of honour, and before the end of the\r\nmonth the marriage was celebrated. In June Parliament confirmed\r\nCranmer's sentence by declaring the invalidity of Henry's previous\r\nmarriages, and the illegitimacy of Mary and Elizabeth, and by fixing\r\nthe succession on the heirs of the king and Jane Seymour. Furthermore,\r\nin case there might be no children it empowered the king to determine\r\nby his will who should succeed. The object of this was to enable him\r\nto appoint as his heir his bastard son, the Duke of Richmond, but this\r\nintention was frustrated by the death of the Duke (July 1537).\r\n\r\nWhile Parliament was in session Convocation assembled once more.\r\nCromwell, as the king's vicar-general in spirituals, claimed the right\r\nto preside either in person or by proxy. Many of the new bishops who\r\nhad been appointed since 1533 were distinctly Lutheran in their ideas\r\nand tendencies. Latimer of Worcester, who was well known to favour\r\nGerman theology, was supported by five others, Shaxton, Goodrich,\r\nEdward Foxe, Hilsey, and Barlow. Though Latimer on a former occasion\r\nhad been censured by Convocation he was selected to deliver the\r\nopening sermon, in which he inveighed against Purgatory, images,\r\naltars, relics, pilgrimages, the carelessness of the clergy, and the\r\nabuses of the spiritual courts. Convocation having approved of\r\nCranmer's verdict regarding Henry's marriage with Anne Boleyn, a\r\npetition was sent up from the lower house to the bishops complaining\r\nof the erroneous views propagated by various preachers in the province\r\nof Canterbury. The vast body of the older bishops were determined to\r\ncondemn these heretical views, which were little less than the renewal\r\nof the Lollard teaching with a slight admixture of Lutheran theology,\r\nbut Cranmer, Latimer, and Foxe were equally determined to prevent such\r\na condemnation. The dispute promised to be both warm and protracted.\r\nCromwell, however, appeared in the assembly with a book of /Ten\r\nArticles/ drawn up by the king for securing religious unanimity, and\r\ninsisted that the prelates should accept them. The Articles were\r\nmoderate in tone, and generally were not in opposition to the old\r\ntheology. They approved of Transubstantiation, emphasised the\r\nimportance and necessity of Baptism, Penance, and the Eucharist\r\nwithout affirming that these were the only three Sacraments, declared\r\nthat good works were necessary for justification, that prayers might\r\nbe offered for those who were dead, that the use of the word Purgatory\r\nwas not to be recommended, that reverence should be shown to images\r\nand pictures, and that the older ceremonies should be retained. The\r\ngreat objection to these Articles was not the doctrine they set forth,\r\nbut the fact that they were issued by the king's authority. That the\r\nKing of England could revise the beliefs and ceremonies of the\r\nCatholic Church was in itself a revolution, and should have opened the\r\neyes of the Catholic-minded bishops to the full meaning of royal\r\nsupremacy. Furthermore, Convocation declared that the Bishop of Rome\r\ncould not convene a General Council without the permission and\r\nco-operation of the Christian princes. A few weeks later Cromwell\r\nissued a set of /Injunctions/ to be observed by the clergy charged\r\nwith the care of souls. They were to set forth the Articles drawn up\r\nby the king, to discourage pilgrimages and the observation of holidays\r\nthat had not been abrogated, not to lay too much stress upon images\r\nand relics, and to warn the people to teach their children in English\r\nthe Our Father, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments; they were to give\r\none-fortieth of their incomes to the poor, one-fifth to the repair of\r\nthe churches, and those who held the richer benefices were commanded\r\nto spend their surplus revenue in maintaining a student or students at\r\nOxford and Cambridge.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1536 three sets of royal commissioners were at work,\r\none superintending the suppression of the lesser monasteries, a second\r\ncharged with communicating Cromwell's instructions to the clergy, and\r\nremoving those priests who were unwilling to accept them, and a third\r\nentrusted with the collection of royal taxation on ecclesiastical\r\nbenefices. By these commissions the entire face of the country was\r\nchanged. The monastic institutions were suppressed and the servants\r\nand labourers in their employment were turned adrift, the relief to\r\nthe poor and the wayfarer was discontinued, and the tenants awaited\r\nwith nervousness the arrival of the new grandees. The possessions of\r\nthe religious houses, instead of being spent on the development of\r\neducation and the relief of the taxes, found their way for the most\r\npart into the royal treasury, or into the pockets of the officials\r\ncharged with the work of suppression. Oxford and Cambridge were\r\nreduced to sullen submission, and obliged to accept a new set of\r\nstatutes, to abolish the study of canon law in favour of civil law, to\r\nconfine the divinity courses to lectures on the Scriptures, and to\r\nplace in the hands of the students the classical authors together with\r\nthe Humanist commentaries thereon, instead of the tomes of Duns Scotus\r\nor St. Thomas. Such changes, as has been shown, led to rebellion in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, but especially in the north, where\r\nloyalty to Rome was still regarded as compatible with loyalty to the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nAfter the suppression of the rebellions in the north and the failure\r\nof Cardinal Pole to bring about an European coalition against Henry,\r\nthe war against the greater monasteries was begun (1537). Those\r\nsituated in the northern counties were charged with having been\r\nimplicated in the rebellion. Many of the abbots were put to death or\r\nimprisoned, and the goods of the communities were confiscated. Several\r\nothers in order to escape punishment were induced to surrender their\r\nproperty to the king's commissioners. In some cases the abbots were\r\nbribed by promises of special favours for themselves, in others they\r\nwere forced to yield up their titles to avoid charges of treason on\r\naccount of documents supposed to have been discovered in their houses\r\nor evidence that had been extracted from some of their monks or\r\nretainers. During the years 1538 and 1539 the monasteries fell one by\r\none, while during the same period war was carried on against shrines\r\nand pilgrimages. The images of Our Lady of Ipswich and of Our Lady of\r\nWalsingham were destroyed; the tomb of St. Thomas à Becket was rifled\r\nof its precious treasures, and the bones and relics of the saint were\r\ntreated with the greatest dishonour. Everywhere throughout the country\r\npreachers inspired by Cromwell and Cranmer, the latter of whom aimed\r\nat nothing less than a Lutheran revolution in England, were at work\r\ndenouncing images, pilgrimages, invocation of saints, and Purgatory.\r\nSo long as money poured into the royal treasury from the sale of\r\nsurrendered monastical property and of the ecclesiastical goods, or so\r\nlong as a blow could be struck at the Papacy by desecrating the tomb\r\nof a saint who had died as a martyr in defence of the Holy See, Henry\r\nlooked on with indifference if not with pleasure.\r\n\r\nBut the news of such outrages could not fail to horrify the Catholic\r\nworld, and to prove to Paul III. that there was little hope of any\r\nfavourable change in Henry's religious policy. It was determined to\r\ngive effect to the Bull of excommunication that had been prepared for\r\nyears, and to call upon the Catholic powers of Europe to put it into\r\nexecution either by a joint declaration of war, or by an interruption\r\nof commercial relations with England. The time seemed specially\r\nfavourable for the publication of such a sentence. After years of\r\nactive or smouldering hostility the two great rivals Charles V. and\r\nFrancis I. had arranged a ten years truce (June 1538), and Cardinal\r\nPole was sent as legate to Spain and France to induce the Emperor and\r\nFrancis I. to take common action. James V. of Scotland promised his\r\nassistance, and a papal envoy was dispatched to Scotland to bear the\r\ncardinal's hat to Archbishop Beaton, and to encourage the king to\r\nco-operate with the Catholic rulers of the Continent.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of these preparations reached England Henry was\r\nthoroughly alarmed for the safety of his kingdom. The brothers of\r\nCardinal Pole, Sir Geoffrey Pole and Lord Montague, his mother, the\r\nCountess of Salisbury, Henry Courtenay, Marquis of Exeter, Lord\r\nDelawarr, Sir Edward Neville, Sir Nicholas Carew, and others were\r\narrested, nominally on the charge of treason, but in reality because\r\nthe Poles and the Courtenays were regarded as dangerous claimants to\r\nthe English throne. With the exception of Sir Geoffrey Pole, who\r\nturned king's evidence, and the Countess of Salisbury who was kept in\r\nconfinement for years, the others were put to death, and commissioners\r\nwere sent into Cornwall to suppress all attempts at rebellion. During\r\nthe spring of 1539 preparations for repelling an invasion were pushed\r\nforward with feverish activity, and so great was the loyalty of the\r\nvast body of the English people, and so hateful to them was the idea\r\nof a foreign invasion that many, who detested Henry's religious\r\npolicy, came forward with their assistance. The fortresses along the\r\ncoast and on the Scottish borders were strengthened, and replenished;\r\nthe fleet was held in readiness in the Thames; and a volunteer army\r\ntrained and equipped was raised to contest the progress of the\r\ninvaders or at least to defend the capital. Negotiations with the\r\nProtestant princes of Germany for the conclusion of an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance were opened, and to prevent a commercial boycott a\r\nproclamation was issued that except in case of wool foreigners trading\r\nin England should be obliged to pay only the duties and customs\r\nimposed upon Englishmen. But as events showed there was no necessity\r\nfor these warlike preparations. Francis I. could not dare to forward\r\nan ultimatum to England unless aided by the Emperor, and Charles V.,\r\nconfronted with a Turkish invasion and a Protestant rebellion in\r\nGermany, found it impossible to undertake an expedition against\r\nEngland. Nor was the project of a commercial boycott likely to be more\r\nsuccessful. The Flemish merchants in the Netherlands were too deeply\r\ninterested in English trade to permit them to look favourably upon a\r\nscheme that was likely to prove as ruinous to their own country as to\r\nEngland, particularly as the recent proclamation in favour of foreign\r\nmerchants offered them a special opportunity for pushing their wares\r\nbeyond the Channel.\r\n\r\nA new Parliament was summoned to meet in April 1539. Cromwell, who was\r\na past master in the art of selecting and managing such assemblies,\r\ntook care that men should be returned who were likely to favour the\r\nprojects of the king, and in this action he succeeded beyond\r\nexpectation. An Act of Attainder was passed against Cardinal Pole and\r\nagainst the Countess of Salisbury, as well as against those who had\r\nbeen executed a short time before. As the /Ten Articles/ on religion\r\npublished by the king and the improved version of these Articles known\r\nas the /Bishop's Book/ had not proved sufficient to suppress religious\r\ncontroversy in the kingdom or to prevent England from being regarded\r\nas a heretical nation on the Continent, Henry determined to lay down a\r\nfixed rule of faith, that should be accepted by all his subjects, and\r\nthat should prove to the Emperor and to France that England, though\r\nseparated from Rome, was still loyal to the Catholic religion. A\r\ncommission of bishops was appointed to prepare a report on the\r\nprincipal points of faith that had been called in question, but the\r\nbishops were divided into two hostile camps. While Cranmer, Latimer,\r\nShaxton, Goodrich, and Barlow were strongly Lutheran in their\r\ntendencies, Archbishop Lee of York, Gardiner of Winchester, Tunstall\r\nof Durham, and Aldrich of Carlisle were opposed to all dogmatic\r\ninnovations. Though Cromwell supported secretly the reforming party it\r\nsoon became known that Henry VIII. favoured the conservatives. As no\r\nagreement could be arrived at by the bishops, the Duke of Norfolk, who\r\nwas rising rapidly at court as the champion of conservative interests,\r\ntook the matter out of the hands of the bishops, by proposing to the\r\nHouse of Lords Six Articles dealing with the main points of difference\r\nbetween the Catholics and the Lutherans of the Continent. On these\r\nArticles the laymen did not venture to express any opinion, but\r\nCranmer, Latimer and their friends held out till at last Henry\r\nappeared himself and \"confounded them all with God's learning.\"\r\n\r\nThe decision was embodied in an Act of Parliament entitled \"An Act\r\nabolishing diversity of Opinions,\" which having received the royal\r\nassent was placed upon the Statute Book (1539). The Articles agreed\r\nupon by Convocation and Parliament and published by the king's\r\nauthority were: (1) that in the Eucharist the substance of the bread\r\nand wine is changed into the Body and Blood of Christ; (2) that\r\nCommunion under both kinds is not necessary for salvation; (3) that\r\nclerical celibacy should be observed; (4) that vows of chastity should\r\nbe observed; (5) that private Masses ought to be retained; and (6)\r\nthat auricular confession is expedient. Denial of the first article,\r\nnamely, that regarding Transubstantiation, was to be deemed heresy\r\npunishable by death at the stake, and denial of the others was felony\r\npunishable by forfeiture for the first and by death for the second\r\noffence. Priests who had taken to themselves wives were commanded to\r\nput them away under threat of punishment for felony, and people, who\r\nrefused to confess and receive the Eucharist at the usual times, were\r\nto be imprisoned or fined for the first offence, and to be judged\r\nguilty of felony for the second offence. The Act of Six Articles, as\r\nit is commonly known, or \"the whip with six strings,\" as it was\r\nnicknamed contemptuously by the Reformers, marked a distinct triumph\r\nfor the conservative party, led by the Duke of Norfolk among the peers\r\nand by Gardiner and Tunstall amongst the bishops. Cranmer made his\r\nsubmission and concealed his wife, but Latimer and Shaxton with\r\ngreater honesty resigned their Sees rather than accept the Act. The\r\nvast body of the clergy and people hailed it with delight as a\r\ncrushing blow delivered against heresy, and as proof that Henry was\r\ndetermined to maintain the old religion in England.[42]\r\n\r\nBut if Cromwell had received a check on the question of dogma, he\r\ndetermined to curry favour with the king and at the same time to\r\nadvance the cause he had at heart, by securing the suppression of the\r\nremaining monasteries. An Act was passed through all its stages in one\r\nday vesting in the king the property of all monasteries that had been\r\nsuppressed or that were to be suppressed. This was done under the\r\npretence that the monks, being ungodly and slothful, should be\r\ndeprived of their wealth, which if handed over to the king could be\r\ndevoted to the relief of poverty, the education of youth, the\r\nimprovement of roads, and the erection of new bishoprics. Under threat\r\nof penalties nearly all the great monasteries surrendered their titles\r\nand lands except the abbots of Glastonbury, Reading, and Colchester,\r\nall of whom were arrested and put to death (1539). This punishment\r\nstruck terror into the hearts of the others, and by the surrender of\r\nWaltham Abbey (March 1540) the last of the great English monasteries\r\ndisappeared. Finally, to show the state of complete subserviency to\r\nwhich the English Parliament was reduced, it passed an Act giving to\r\nthe royal proclamation with certain ill-defined limits the force of\r\nlaw (1539).\r\n\r\nIt was evident to all that the position of Cromwell at court had\r\nbecome very insecure. While England was threatened with an European\r\ncoalition he had suggested an alliance with the Protestant princes of\r\nGermany, and as Henry's third wife Jane Seymour had died (1537), after\r\nhaving given birth to a son (later on Edward VI.), he determined to\r\ncement the bond of friendship by a new matrimonial alliance. The Duke\r\nof Cleves was brother-in-law to the Elector of Saxony and one of the\r\nguiding spirits of the Schmalkaldic League, and as he had given mortal\r\noffence to the Emperor by his acceptance of the Duchy of Guelders,\r\nCromwell decided that a marriage between the Duke's sister, Anne, and\r\nHenry VIII. would secure for England both the alliance of the League\r\nof Schmalkald and at least the neutrality of France. Though Henry\r\ndetested the Elector of Saxony and his friends as heretics, and though\r\nthe Six Articles aroused considerable resentment in the Lutheran camp,\r\nthe close union between Charles V. and Francis I. and the uncertainty\r\nof what steps they might take made it imperative to push forward\r\nHenry's marriage. The marriage treaty was signed in October 1539, and\r\nin December Anne of Cleves landed at Deal. Henry, who had been led to\r\nbelieve that Anne was both accomplished and moderately beautiful,\r\ncould not conceal his disappointment when he met his prospective\r\nbride; but, as his trusted counsellors could devise no plan of escape,\r\nhe consented with bad grace to go through the ceremony of marriage\r\n(6th Jan., 1540). Henry was displeased and made no secret of his\r\ndispleasure. Cromwell, whom he blamed specially for this matrimonial\r\nmisfortune, felt himself in considerable danger, though at the same\r\ntime he resolved not to yield without a struggle. The contest between\r\nCranmer, backed by the Lutheran party in the council, and Gardiner,\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, and the conservatives was sharp though by no\r\nmeans decisive. The king appeared at one time to favour one side, at\r\nanother the other side, unwilling to commit himself definitely to\r\neither, especially as Cromwell was still reaping a rich harvest from\r\nthe suppression of the Knights of St. John and from the taxes imposed\r\non the clergy.\r\n\r\nParliament met again in April 1540. To the surprise of many Cromwell\r\nwas created Earl of Essex (17th April), while a little later Bishop\r\nSampson was arrested as a supporter of the Pope. The hopes of Cromwell\r\nand of the reforming party rose rapidly, and they believed that\r\nvictory was within their grasp. The committee of bishops was at work\r\nconsidering the sacraments, but as both the old and the new clung\r\ntenaciously to their opinions no progress could be made. Suddenly on\r\nthe 10th June an officer appeared in the council chamber and placed\r\nCromwell under arrest. The long struggle was at last ended, and the\r\nmen who had followed Gardiner had won the day. The war clouds, that\r\nhad driven Henry to negotiate with the heretical princes of Germany,\r\nhad blown over, and Cromwell, who had taken a leading part in the\r\nGerman negotiations, must be sacrificed to satisfy his enemies at home\r\nand Catholic opinion on the Continent. He was committed to the Tower\r\nto await the sentence of death which he knew to be inevitable, but,\r\nbefore handing him over to the executioner, Henry insisted that he\r\nshould perform for him one last service. As Cromwell had involved him\r\nin an undesirable marriage with Anne of Cleves, he should provide\r\nevidence that might set his master free to seek for a more congenial\r\npartner. At the command of the king Cromwell wrote a long letter, in\r\nwhich he showed that Henry never really consented to the marriage with\r\nAnne, against which marriage the existence of a pre-nuptial contract\r\nwas also adduced. On the strength of this, Parliament demanded an\r\ninvestigation, and a commission was issued empowering the Archbishops\r\nof Canterbury and York and others of the clergy to examine into the\r\nvalidity of the marriage. Convocation decided that it was null and\r\nvoid (July 1540), a decision with which Anne expressed her complete\r\nsatisfaction. She was assigned a residence and a pension of £4,000 a\r\nyear. On the 28th July, 1540, Cromwell was led to execution at Tyburn,\r\nwhere he expressed publicly his adherence to the ancient faith, for\r\nthe destruction of which in England he had contributed more than any\r\nsingle individual with the exception possibly of the king.[43] A few\r\ndays later Henry was married to Catharine Howard, a niece of the Duke\r\nof Norfolk, the recognised lay head of the conservative party in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe penalties prescribed in the Statute of the Six Articles were\r\nenforced with great vigour, and at the same time those who maintained\r\npapal supremacy were treated with equal severity. While the men who\r\ndenied Transubstantiation were burned as heretics at Smithfield, their\r\nopponents, who dared to express views derogatory to royal supremacy,\r\nwere hanged, drawn, and quartered as traitors. Latimer retired into\r\nprivate life; Cranmer showed no signs of open opposition to the king's\r\nreligious policy, and, practically speaking, all traces of the new\r\nteachings that had disturbed England for years disappeared. The aged\r\nCountess of Salisbury, mother of Cardinal Pole, was put to death in\r\n1541, two years after sentence of attainder had been passed against\r\nher by Parliament, as were, also, a large number of priests and laymen\r\nsuspected of having been implicated in an attempt to bring about\r\nanother rebellion in the north. In consequence of this plot Henry\r\ndetermined to undertake a journey to York (1541) with the hope of\r\nstrengthening his hold upon the people, and possibly also of securing\r\nthe friendship of his nephew, James V. of Scotland, who had remained\r\nloyal to Rome and to France. The Archbishop of York made his\r\nsubmission on bended knees, presenting the king with a gift of £600 as\r\na sign of the repentance of the people for their recent disobedience,\r\nan example that was followed in many of the cities and towns; but\r\nJames V., unwilling to trust his life and liberty to the king, refused\r\nto cross the English border.\r\n\r\nHenry returned to London only to find that serious charges of\r\nimmorality were being brought against his wife, Catharine Howard. She\r\nwas arrested and put to death with her chief accomplices (1542).\r\nThough the king could not conceal his joy at finding himself free once\r\nmore, he hesitated for some time before choosing another wife; but at\r\nlast in 1543, his choice fell upon Catharine Parr, a young widow\r\ntwenty years his junior, who was believed to favour royal supremacy,\r\nthough she had been married previously to one of the leaders of the\r\nPilgrimage of Grace. It is said that once at least she stood in\r\nserious risk because she ventured to disagree with her husband's\r\ntheological views, but, however that may be, it is certain that she\r\nhad the good fortune to survive the king.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between the old principles and the new continued,\r\nnotwithstanding all Henry's attempts to secure unanimity. As early as\r\n1540 a set of questions had been circulated amongst the bishops, and\r\nas a result of the replies received and of the discussions that took\r\nplace in Convocation a book was issued, entitled /A Necessary Doctrine\r\nand an Erudition for any Christian Man/ (1543). It was issued by order\r\nof the king, and for this reason is known as the /King's Book/ in\r\ncontradistinction to the /Bishop's Book/, published with his\r\npermission but not by his authorisation. Just as the /Bishop's Book/\r\nrepresented a revision of the Ten Articles, so the /King's Book/ was\r\nan extension or completion of the /Bishop's Book/, in many respects\r\neven more Catholic in its tone than the original. The king was now\r\nnearing his end rapidly, and both parties in the royal council strove\r\nhard for mastery. Gardiner and Bonner, Bishop of London, stood firm in\r\ndefence of Catholic doctrine, and once or twice it seemed as if they\r\nwere about to succeed in displacing Cranmer from the favour of the\r\nking; but the danger of an attack from the united forces of France and\r\nthe Emperor, especially after the peace of Crépy had been concluded\r\n(1544), made it necessary for Henry not to close the door against an\r\nalliance with the Protestant princes of Germany by an attack on\r\nCranmer, who was regarded by them as an active sympathiser. Once\r\nindeed Henry ordered that the archbishop should be arrested, but a\r\nsudden change of mind took place, and the order for the arrest was\r\ncancelled.\r\n\r\nA new Parliament met in 1545. The royal exchequer had been emptied by\r\nthe war with France and Scotland, and to replenish it an Act was\r\npassed empowering the king to dissolve chantries, hospitals, and free\r\nchapels, and to appropriate their revenues for his own use. Henry\r\naddressed the Parliament on Christmas Eve 1545 in a speech in which he\r\ndeplored the religious differences that divided his people,\r\ndifferences which were due, he said, partly to the obstinacy of the\r\nclergy, some of whom wished to cling to all the old ways, while others\r\nof them would be content with nothing less than a complete renewal;\r\npartly to the fault of the people who spoke scandalously of their\r\nclergy, and abused the Scriptures they had been permitted to read. In\r\nitself this speech was a sad commentary on Henry's religious campaign,\r\ncontaining as it did a confession that despite all his violence and\r\npersecution, religious formularies imposed by royal authority were not\r\nsufficient to preserve religious unity. During the year 1546, though\r\nmany persons were still sent to the stake for denying\r\nTransubstantiation, the power of Cranmer and his party was on the\r\nincrease. The Earl of Hertford, uncle of the young Prince Edward and\r\nCranmer secured the upper hand in the council, and the Duke of\r\nNorfolk, together with his son the Earl of Surrey, was imprisoned in\r\nthe Tower (Dec. 1546). Surrey was tried and executed, and a similar\r\nfate was in store for the Duke, were it not that before the death-\r\nsentence could be carried out, Henry himself had been summoned before\r\nthe judgment-seat of God (28th Jan. 1547). For some weeks before his\r\ndeath the condition of the king had been serious, but the Earl of\r\nHertford and his party kept the sickness and even the death a secret\r\nuntil all their plans had been matured. On the 31st January Edward VI.\r\nwas proclaimed king, and the triumph of the Lutheran party seemed\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Henry VIII. all parties looked forward to a complete\r\nchange in the religious condition of England. On the one hand, those,\r\nwho longed for a return to Roman obedience, believed that royal\r\nsupremacy must of necessity prove both unintelligible and\r\nimpracticable in the case of a mere child like Edward VI. (1547-53);\r\nwhile, on the other hand, those, who favoured a closer approximation\r\nto the theology and practices of Wittenberg or of Geneva, saw in the\r\ndeath of Henry and the succession of a helpless young king an\r\nexceptional opportunity for carrying out designs against which Henry\r\nhad erected such formidable barriers. To both parties it was evident\r\nthat at best Edward VI. could be but a tool in the hands of his\r\nadvisers, and that whichever section could capture the king and the\r\nmachinery of government might hope to mould the religious beliefs of\r\nthe English people.\r\n\r\nFor more than a year before the death of Henry VIII., Edward Seymour,\r\nEarl of Hertford and uncle of Edward VI., the Earl of Essex, brother\r\nof Catharine Parr, Viscount Lisle, Lord Admiral and afterwards Earl of\r\nWarwick, all of whom were in favour of religious innovations, had been\r\nadvancing steadily in power, to the discomfiture of the conservative\r\nsection led by Bishop Gardiner, the Duke of Norfolk, and the Lord\r\nChancellor Wriothesley. The death of Henry VIII. had been kept a\r\nsecret until the Earl of Hertford had all his plans matured for\r\nsecuring control, and for the proclamation of Edward VI.[44] (31st\r\nJan. 1547), then a boy of ten years. Henry VIII. had bequeathed the\r\ncrown to his son, and on his death without heirs to his daughters in\r\nturn, the Princess Mary daughter of Catharine of Aragon, and Elizabeth\r\ndaughter of Anne Boleyn. By his will also he appointed a council the\r\nmembers of which were to govern the kingdom as a body till the king\r\nshould attain his eighteenth year, but he sought to provide against\r\nany serious innovations by authorising the king to repeal all changes\r\nthat might have been made by the council during his minority. If one\r\nmay judge from the terms of his will Henry's religious views at his\r\ndeath were evidently what they had been when in 1539 he passed the\r\nStatute of Six Articles, but, at the same time, it is a noteworthy\r\nfact that he excluded Bishop Gardiner from the list of executors of\r\nhis will, and appointed two divines well known for their leaning\r\ntowards German theology as tutors to the young king.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every particular the council of executors failed to carry\r\nout the wishes of the late king. The Earl of Hertford, created later\r\non Duke of Somerset, became Protector with almost royal powers, and\r\ninstead of defending the religious settlement the majority of the\r\ncouncil set themselves from the very beginning to initiate a more\r\nadvanced policy. Cranmer as Archbishop of Canterbury could be relied\r\nupon to support such a course of action, while, of the principal men\r\nwho might be expected to oppose it, the Duke of Norfolk was a prisoner\r\nin the Tower and the Lord Chancellor Wriothesley was dismissed to make\r\nway for a more pliable successor. The bishops, who were regarded\r\nmerely as state officials, were commanded to take out new commissions.\r\nCranmer obeyed without protest, as did all the others except Gardiner,\r\nwho questioned the authority of the council to issue such a command at\r\nleast until the supreme head of the Church should have reached his\r\nmajority.[45]\r\n\r\nThose who had been held in check by the repressive legislation of\r\nHenry VIII. felt themselves free to renew the attacks on the practices\r\nand doctrines of the Church. The royal preachers who had been\r\nappointed for the Lenten sermons, Dr. Barlow, Bishop of St. David's,\r\nRidley one of Cranmer's chaplains, and others, not content with\r\nabusing the Bishop of Rome, declared war on images, relics, and even\r\non the Lenten fasts and abstinences. Against such novelties Gardiner\r\naddressed an indignant protest to the Protector and council, warning\r\nthem that during the minority of the king there was no power in\r\nEngland competent to change the religious settlement that had been\r\naccomplished by Henry VIII. But his protest fell on deaf ears. The war\r\nagainst images was carried on vigorously, though legally only those\r\nimages that had been abused were forbidden, and even in Bishop\r\nGardiner's own diocese he was powerless to resist those who knew they\r\ncould count on the support of the Protector.\r\n\r\nIn July 1547 two important publications were issued, one, /The\r\nInjunctions of Edward VI./, the other, /The Book of Homilies/,\r\ncomposed by Cranmer, and issued by the authority of the council. The\r\nformer of these commanded that sermons should be delivered at fixed\r\nintervals against the Bishop of Rome, that images which had been\r\nabused, shrines, pictures, and other monuments of superstition should\r\nbe destroyed, that the Gospels and Epistles should be read in English,\r\nthat alms boxes should be set up in all churches, and that the clergy\r\nshould inform their people that the money spent on pardons,\r\npilgrimages, candles, and other blind devotions should now be devoted\r\nto the support of the poor.[46] The /Book of Homilies/[47] was to\r\nserve as a guide for preachers in their public services. A royal\r\ncommission was appointed to insist upon the observance of these\r\nInjunctions, but in London Bishop Bonner refused at first to accept\r\nthe commands of the visitors, and though later on he weakened in his\r\nresistance, he was committed to prison as a warning to others.\r\nGardiner boldly denounced the visitation as illegal and unwarrantable,\r\nbut the council instead of meeting his arguments and remonstrances\r\nordered his arrest (September 1547). In many places the proclamation\r\nfor the removal of images led to violent disturbances, and free fights\r\nwithin the churches were not uncommon. To put an end to any\r\nmisunderstanding on this subject for the future the council ordered\r\nthe removal of all images from the churches (Feb. 1548).\r\n\r\nFor various reasons the Protector and council delayed assembling\r\nParliament as long as possible, but at last it was convoked to meet in\r\nNovember 1547. As happened in the case of all the Parliaments in the\r\nTudor period, careful steps were taken to ensure that only men who\r\ncould be relied upon were returned by the sheriffs. Neither from the\r\nlay members in the House of Lords, many of whom had been enriched by\r\nthe plunder of the monasteries, nor from the spiritual peers lately\r\nappointed, could any effective resistance be expected, while the\r\nbishops who were still strongly Catholic in tone were deprived of a\r\ncapable leader by the imprisonment of Gardiner. It was significant\r\nthat in the Mass celebrated at the opening of Parliament the /Gloria/,\r\nCreed, and /Agnus Dei/ were sung in English. The bishops had been\r\ntaught a lesson already by being forced to take out new commissions\r\nlike other officers of the crown, by having their jurisdiction\r\nsuspended during the progress of the royal visitation, and by being\r\nprohibited from preaching outside their own cathedrals. But, lest they\r\nmight have any lingering doubts about the source or extent of their\r\njurisdiction, Parliament enacted that for the future bishops should be\r\nappointed not by election but by royal letters patent, and that all\r\ntheir official documents should be issued in the king's name and under\r\nhis seal or some other seal authorised by him.[48] All the Acts\r\nagainst heresy that had been passed since the days of Richard II.,\r\nincluding the Statute of Six Articles, were repealed; most of the new\r\ntreason-felonies created during the previous reign were abolished;\r\nand, though denial of royal supremacy was accounted still as treason,\r\nit was enacted that by merely speaking against it one did not merit\r\nthe punishment of death unless for the third offence.\r\n\r\nThe question of the Blessed Eucharist had come to the front rapidly\r\nowing to the violent and abusive sermons of some of the new preachers,\r\nand the irreverent and sacrilegious conduct of those who accepted\r\ntheir teaching. The bishops of the old school demanded that measures\r\nshould be taken to prevent such attacks on the very centre point of\r\nChristian worship, while Cranmer and his supporters were determined to\r\ninsist upon Communion under both kinds. Apparently two different\r\nmeasures were introduced, which were merged ultimately into one Act,\r\nwhereby it was decreed that all who spoke irreverently against the\r\nBlessed Eucharist should be punished by fines and imprisonment, and\r\nthat Communion should be administered under both kinds except\r\nnecessity otherwise required. The linking together of these two Acts\r\nwas a clever move to ensure the support of the bishops who desired to\r\nput down irreverence against the Eucharist, and it is noteworthy that\r\nout of the eleven bishops present five voted against the measure even\r\nin its improved form.[49]\r\n\r\nAlready an Act had been passed in the previous reign against colleges,\r\nchantries, guilds, etc., but since most of these remained as yet\r\nundisturbed, it was determined to replenish the royal treasury by\r\ndecreeing their immediate dissolution, and by vesting their property\r\nin the king. This was done with the avowed object of diverting the\r\nfunds from superstitious uses to the erection of grammar schools, the\r\nmaintenance of students at the universities, and the relief of the\r\npoor; but in reality the property of the guilds, and of the free\r\nschools and chantry schools, was confiscated, and little if anything\r\nwas done for the improvement of education or for the relief of the\r\npoor. Edward VI. is represented generally as the founder of the\r\nEnglish grammar schools and colleges, but it would be much more\r\ncorrect to say that through his greedy ministers he was their\r\ndestroyer. True, indeed, he established a few colleges and hospitals,\r\nbut such beneficence was only a poor return for the wholesale\r\noverthrow of more than four hundred flourishing educational\r\nestablishments, and for the confiscation of thousands of pounds\r\nbequeathed by generous benefactors for the education of the poor.[50]\r\n\r\nConvocation had met on the day after the assembly of Parliament. The\r\nlower house presented four petitions to the bishops, the most\r\nimportant of which was that the proctors of the clergy should be\r\nadmitted to Parliament, or at least that ecclesiastical legislation\r\nshould not pass until the clergy had been consulted, but the bishops\r\nwere too conscious of their helplessness to support such an appeal. It\r\nis doubtful if the bill regarding Communion under both kinds was ever\r\nsubmitted regularly to Convocation, though later on a proposal to\r\nabolish the canons enforcing clerical celibacy was carried by a\r\nmajority. It is asserted, and apparently on good authority, that the\r\nhigher and more learned of the clergy consented to this proposal only\r\nunder pressure.\r\n\r\nThe year 1548 opened ominously for the Catholic party. Preachers,\r\nlicensed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and protected openly by the\r\ncourt, delivered wild harangues against Catholic doctrines and\r\npractices. Pamphlets, for the most part translations of heretical\r\nworks published in Germany or Switzerland attacking the Mass,\r\nTransubstantiation, and the Real Presence, were sold publicly in the\r\nmarket places without any interference from the authorities. In\r\nJanuary a royal proclamation was issued enjoining the observance of\r\nthe Lenten fasts, but ten days later an order was made forbidding the\r\nuse of candles on Candlemas Day, of ashes on Ash Wednesday, or of\r\npalms on Palm Sunday. This was followed quickly by a command for the\r\nremoval of all statues, images, pictures, etc. from the churches. The\r\nuse of Communion under both kinds was to come into force at Easter\r\n1548, and to prepare for this a royal proclamation was set forth\r\nmaking obligatory the English /Order for Communion/. As the new rite\r\nregarded only the Communion of the laity, the Latin Mass was to remain\r\nin use as heretofore \"without any varying of any rite or\r\nceremony.\"[51] The clergy were commanded to announce the Sunday on\r\nwhich they proposed to distribute Communion to their flocks. After the\r\npriest had himself communicated, the communicants, who did not wish to\r\ngo to confession, should make a general confession, and should receive\r\nCommunion under both kinds, the whole service being completed by the\r\nusual blessing. This was a clever trick to prepare the way for still\r\ngreater changes. Owing to the retention of the Latin Mass it was\r\nexpected that the new Communion service would not lead to serious\r\ntrouble, while at the same time it would accustom the people to\r\nportions of the Mass being read in English, and would imply both that\r\nauricular confession was unnecessary and that Mass without Communion\r\nof the laity was of no particular importance. The council anticipated\r\nthat the Communion service would prove unacceptable to many of the\r\nclergy, and their anticipations were fulfilled, though, as shall be\r\nseen, they adopted a novel method of allaying the trouble.\r\n\r\nBishop Gardiner, who had been kept in prison while Parliament was in\r\nsession lest his presence in the Upper House might lead to trouble,\r\nwas released in January 1548, but in May a peremptory summons was\r\nissued commanding him to come to London without delay. He obeyed, and\r\nfor some time negotiations were carried on, until at last he was\r\nordered to preach against the Pope, monasteries, confession, and in\r\nfavour of the English Communion service (29th June). He was urged not\r\nto treat of the sacrifice of the Mass, or of Transubstantiation, and\r\nwarned of the serious consequences that might ensue in case he\r\ndisobeyed; but Gardiner was a man who could not be deterred by such\r\nmeans from speaking his mind, and as a consequence he was again placed\r\nunder arrest, and sent as a prisoner to the Tower. Cranmer, who had\r\nrejected the authority of the Pope because he was a foreigner, finding\r\nthat he could get no support from the clergy or the universities--for\r\nin spite of everything that had taken place the theology of Oxford and\r\nCambridge was still frankly conservative--invited preachers to come\r\nfrom abroad to assist in weaning the English nation from the Catholic\r\nfaith. The men who responded to his call formed a motley crowd. They\r\nwere Germans like Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius, Italian apostate\r\nfriars like Peter Martyr (Pietro Martire Vermigli) and Ochino,\r\nFrenchmen like Jean Véron, Poles like John à Lasco, Belgians like\r\nCharles Utenhove, à Lasco's disciple, and Jews like Emmanuel\r\nTremellius.[52] The order for the total removal of images and for the\r\nCommunion service in English led to serious disturbances even in the\r\nLondon churches, where the new opinions should have found the\r\nstrongest support, and confusion reigned throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe Communion service in England was, however, only the prelude to the\r\ntotal abolition of the Mass. Early in 1548 a series of questions had\r\nbeen addressed by Cranmer to the bishops regarding the value of the\r\nMass as a religious service apart from the Communion.[53] The bishops\r\nwere asked to say also whether private Masses offered for the living\r\nand the dead should continue to be celebrated, and what language\r\nshould be used. In their replies Cranmer and Ridley favoured\r\ninnovation, and were supported generally by Holbeach, Barlow, Cox, and\r\nTaylor. One, Bishop Goodrich of Ely, expressed his willingness to\r\naccept whatever might be enjoined, while the rest of the bishops\r\nadopted a conservative attitude. But whatever might be the opinions of\r\nthe bishops generally the Protector and Cranmer were determined to\r\nprocure the abolition of the Mass. Later in the year an assembly of\r\nthe bishops was held to discuss the new English service to be\r\nsubstituted in its place. It is difficult to determine what precisely\r\nwas done at this meeting. From the discussions which took place\r\nafterwards in the House of Lords it is clear that the bishops could\r\nnot agree upon the Eucharist, that all with one exception signed their\r\nnames to a rough draft drawn up on the understanding that they did not\r\ncommit themselves thereby to Cranmer's views, and that the episcopal\r\nreport was changed by some authority before it was presented to\r\nParliament, especially by the omission of the word \"oblation\" in\r\nregard to the Mass. That the Book of Common Prayer as such was ever\r\nsubmitted to or approved by a formal convocation of the clergy cannot\r\nbe shown.[54]\r\n\r\nParliament met in November 1548. To put an end to the religious\r\nconfusion that had arisen an Act of Uniformity enjoining on all clergy\r\nthe use of the Book of Common Prayer was introduced.[55] The main\r\ndiscussion centred around the Eucharist and the Mass. Bishop Tunstall\r\nof Durham objected that by the omission of the Adoration it was\r\nimplied that there was nothing in the Sacrament except bread and wine,\r\na contention that he could not accept, as he believed in the Real\r\nPresence of the Body and Blood of Christ both spiritual and carnal.\r\nBishop Thirlby of Westminster maintained that the bishops had never\r\nagreed to the doctrine contained in the Book regarding the Eucharist\r\nbut had allowed it merely to go forward for discussion. The Protector\r\nreproved him warmly for his tone and statement, but Thirlby stood\r\nfirmly by his point of view, adding the interesting item of\r\ninformation that when the Book left the hands of the bishops it\r\ncontained the word \"oblation\" in reference to the Mass, which word had\r\nsince been omitted. Bonner of London pointed out that the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer, embodying as it did statements condemned abroad and in\r\nEngland as heresy, should not be accepted. Cranmer and Ridley defended\r\nstrongly the Eucharistic doctrine it contained. When the disputation\r\nbetween the bishops had been closed (19th Dec., 1548) the Bill for\r\nUniformity was brought down and read in the Commons. Of the bishops\r\npresent in the House of Lords ten voted in favour of the measure and\r\neight against it. Gardiner was still in prison, the Bishop of\r\nLlandaff, who had spoken against Cranmer, was absent from the\r\ndivision, and some others are not accounted for.[56]\r\n\r\nThe first Act of Uniformity (1548), as it is called, displaced the\r\nMass as it had been celebrated for centuries in the English Church,\r\nand substituted in its place the new liturgy contained in the /Book of\r\nCommon Prayer/.[57] This latter while differing completely from any\r\nrite that had been followed in the Catholic Church, had a close\r\naffinity both in regard to the rites themselves and the ceremonies for\r\nthe administration of the Sacraments to the liturgy introduced by the\r\nGerman Lutherans. According to the Act of Parliament it was to come\r\ninto force on Whit Sunday the 9th June (1549). That it was expected to\r\nmeet with strong opposition is evident from the prohibition against\r\nplays, songs, rhymes, etc., holding it up to ridicule, as well as by\r\nthe heavy fines prescribed against those who might endeavour to\r\nprevent clergymen from following it. Forfeiture of a year's revenue\r\ntogether with imprisonment for six months was the penalty to be\r\ninflicted on any clergyman who refused to follow the new liturgy.\r\nComplete deprivation and imprisonment were prescribed for the second\r\noffence, and the third offence was to be punished by life-long\r\nimprisonment. For preventing any clergyman from adopting the new\r\nliturgy the penalties were for the first offence a fine of £10, for\r\nthe second £20, and for the third forfeiture and perpetual\r\nimprisonment. Finally Parliament satisfied Cranmer's scruples by\r\npermitting clergy to contract marriages.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to abolish the Mass and to force the new liturgy on the\r\nEnglish people led to risings and disturbances throughout the country.\r\nIn London, where it might have been expected that the influence of the\r\ncourt should have secured its ready acceptance, many of the churches\r\nmaintained the old service in spite of the frantic efforts of Cranmer\r\nand his subordinates. Bishop Bonner was reproved sharply for\r\nencouraging the disobedience of his clergy, and as he failed to give\r\nsatisfaction to the government he was committed to prison. In\r\nDevonshire and Cornwall[58] the peasants and country gentlemen rose in\r\narms to protest against the new service which they had likened to a\r\nChristmas game, and to demand the restoration of the Mass, Communion\r\nunder one kind, holy water, palms, ashes, images, and pictures. They\r\ninsisted that the Six Articles of Henry VIII. should be enforced once\r\nmore and that Cardinal Pole should be recalled from Rome, and honoured\r\nwith a seat at the council. In the Universities of Oxford and\r\nCambridge, where royal visitors and hired foreigners like Peter\r\nMartyr, Bucer, and Ochino were doing their best to decatholicise these\r\nseats of learning, violent commotions took place, that served to\r\narouse both students and people, and soon the country around Oxford\r\nwas in a blaze. The religious disturbances encouraged those who\r\npreferred small farms and sturdy labourers to grazing inclosures and\r\nsheep to raise the standard of revolt against the new economical\r\ntendencies, and to accept the leadership of the Norfolk tanner,\r\nWilliam Kett.[59] By the strenuous exertions of the Protector and the\r\ncouncil, backed as they were by foreign mercenaries raised in Italy\r\nand Germany to fight against Scotland, these rebellions were put down\r\nby force, and the leaders, both lay and clerical, were punished with\r\nmerciless severity. The disturbed condition of the country, however,\r\nthe open dissatisfaction of the Catholic party, the compromises that\r\nwere offered to those who fought against inclosures, and the\r\nunfortunate war with France into which the country had been plunged,\r\npointed to Somerset's unfitness for the office of Protector. A\r\ncombination was formed against him by the Earl of Warwick, assisted by\r\nthe leaders of the Catholic party. He was arrested, found guilty, and\r\ndeprived of all his offices (Dec. 1549), and the Earl of Warwick,\r\ncreated later Duke of Northumberland, secured the principal share in\r\nthe new government.\r\n\r\nCranmer and his foreign assistants were filled with alarm for the\r\nfuture of their cause. They feared that the new administration would\r\nbe controlled by Wriothesley, ex-Chancellor, the Arundels, Southwell\r\nand other prominent Catholics, that Gardiner and Bonner might be\r\nreleased from imprisonment, and that the demands of many of the\r\ninsurgents for the abolition of the Book of Common Prayer and the\r\nrestoration of the Mass might be conceded. The Catholic party were\r\nfilled with new hope; in Oxford and throughout the country the old\r\nmissals and vestments that had been hidden away were brought forth\r\nagain, and the offices and Mass were sung as they had been for\r\ncenturies.[60] But Warwick soon showed that the change of rulers meant\r\nno change in the religious policy of the government. Gardiner and\r\nBonner were still kept in confinement; Wriothesley was dismissed from\r\nthe council; many of the other Catholic noblemen were imprisoned, and\r\nSomerset who was supposed to have fallen a victim to the hatred of the\r\nCatholics was released from his prison and re-admitted to the privy\r\ncouncil (1550). By the inglorious war with France and by the still\r\nmore inglorious peace of Boulogne the government felt itself free to\r\ndevote its energies to the religious situation at home. Warwick went\r\nover completely to the camp of the reforming party and determined in\r\nconsultation with them to push forward the anti-Catholic campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament that assembled in November 1549 was distinctly radical\r\nin its tendencies. In the House of Lords the bishops complained that\r\ntheir authority had been destroyed, and that their orders were set at\r\nnaught. In reply they were requested to formulate a proposal for\r\nredress, but on such a proposal having been submitted, their demands\r\nwere regarded by the laymen as exorbitant. A commission was appointed\r\nagainst the wishes of a strong minority of the bishops to draw up a\r\nnew Ordinal as a complement to the Book of Common Prayer. The\r\ncommittee was appointed on the 2nd February 1550, and it appears to\r\nhave finished its work within a week. In the new /Ordinal/[61] (1550)\r\nthe ceremonies for the conferring of tonsure, minor orders, and sub-\r\ndeaconship were omitted entirely, while the ordination rites for\r\ndeacons, priests, and bishops were considerably modified. Just as the\r\nsacrificial character of the Mass had been dropped out of the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer, so too the notion of a real priesthood disappeared from\r\nthe forms for ordination. In spite of the opposition of a large body\r\nof the bishops, an Act was passed ordering the destruction of all\r\nmissals, antiphonals, processionals, manuals, ordinals, etc., used\r\nformerly in the service of the Church and not approved of by the\r\nking's majesty, as well as for the removal of all images \"except any\r\nimage or picture set or graven upon any tomb in any church, chapel or\r\nchurchyard only for a monument of any king, prince, nobleman or other\r\ndead person who had not been commonly reputed and taken for a\r\nsaint.\"[62] As a result of this measure a wholesale destruction of\r\nvaluable books and manuscripts took place in the king's own library at\r\nWestminster and throughout the country. The royal visitors, entrusted\r\nwith the difficult work of Protestantising Oxford, acting under the\r\nguidance of Dr. Cox, chancellor of the University or \"cancellor\" as he\r\nwas called, ransacked the college libraries, tore up and burned\r\npriceless manuscripts or sold them as waste paper, and even went so\r\nfar as to demand the destruction of the chapel windows, lest these\r\nbeautiful specimens of art might encourage loyalty to the old religion\r\nthat had inspired their artists and donors.\r\n\r\nAs it had been determined to abandon completely the religious\r\nconservatism of the former reign it was felt absolutely necessary to\r\nremove the Catholic-minded bishops, to make way for men of the new\r\nschool on whom the government could rely with confidence. Gardiner of\r\nWinchester and Bonner of London were already in prison. Heath of\r\nWorcester, who had refused to agree to the new Ordinal, was arrested\r\nin March 1550, as was also Day of Chichester in October. Tunstall of\r\nDurham, whose conservative views were well known to all, was placed\r\nunder surveillance in May 1551, and thrown into prison together with\r\nhis dean in the following November. In a short time a sentence of\r\ndeprivation was issued against Bonner, Heath, Day and Gardiner. Bishop\r\nThirlby of Westminster, who had given great offence by his\r\nuncompromising attitude regarding the Blessed Eucharist, was removed\r\nfrom Westminster, where his presence was highly inconvenient, to\r\nNorwich, and the aged Bishop Voysey was forced to resign the See of\r\nExeter to make way for a more reliable and more active man. At the\r\nsame time steps were taken in the universities to drive out the men\r\nwhose influence might be used against the government's plans. The Sees\r\nof Westminster and London were combined and handed over to Ridley of\r\nRochester, one of Cranmer's ablest and most advanced lieutenants.\r\nHooper, who looked to Zwingli as his religious guide, was appointed to\r\nGloucester; but as he objected to the episcopal oath, and episcopal\r\nvestments, and as he insisted on his rights of private judgment so far\r\nas to write publicly against those things that had been sanctioned by\r\nthe supreme head of the Church, it was necessary to imprison him[63]\r\nbefore he could be reduced to a proper frame of mind for the\r\nimposition of Cranmer's hands (March 1551). Ponet was appointed to\r\nRochester, and on the deprivation of Gardiner, to Winchester, where\r\nhis scandalous and public connexion with the wife of a Nottingham\r\nburgher[64] was not calculated to influence the longing of his flock\r\nfor the new teaching. Scory was appointed to Rochester and afterwards\r\nto Chichester, and Miles Coverdale to Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe zeal of the new bishops in seeking out the suppression of\r\npapistical practices and their readiness to place the property of the\r\nchurches at Northumberland's disposal soon showed that those who\r\nselected them had made no mistake. On Ridley's arrival in London he\r\nheld a conference for the purpose of compelling the clergy to adopt\r\nthe new liturgy in place of the Mass. He issued an order for the\r\nremoval of altars, and for the erection in their places of \"honest\r\ntables decently covered,\" whereon Communion might be celebrated. The\r\nhigh altar in the Cathedral of St. Paul was pulled down, and a plain\r\nCommunion table set up in its stead. As such a sacrilegious innovation\r\nwas resented by a great body of both clergy and people, the council\r\nfelt it necessary to instruct the sheriff of Middlesex to enforce the\r\ncommands of the bishop. The example thus set in the capital was to be\r\nfollowed throughout the country. In November 1550 letters were sent\r\nout to all the bishops in the name of the youthful head of the Church,\r\ncommanding them to pull down the altars in their dioceses, and for\r\ndisobedience to this order Bishop Day was arrested. Hooper, once his\r\nscruples regarding the episcopal oath and vestments had been removed,\r\nthrew himself with ardour into the work of reforming the clergy of his\r\ndioceses of Worcester and Gloucester, but only to find that nothing\r\nless than a royal decree could serve to detach them from their old\r\n\"superstitions\" (1552). While the wholesale work of destruction was\r\nbeing pushed forward care was taken that none of the spoils derived\r\nfrom the plunder of the churches should go to private individuals.\r\nWarwick insisted on the new bishops handing over large portions of\r\nepiscopal estates to be conferred on his favourites, and royal\r\ncommissions were issued to take inventories of ecclesiastical\r\nproperty. During the years 1551 and 1552 the churches were stripped of\r\ntheir valuables, and the church plate, chalices, copes, vestments, and\r\naltar cloths, were disposed of to provide money for the impecunious\r\nmembers of the council.\r\n\r\nViolent measures such as these were not likely to win popularity for\r\nthe new religion, nor to bring about dogmatic unity. Risings took\r\nplace in Leicester, Northampton, Rutland, and Berkshire, and free\r\nfights were witnessed even in the churches of London. Rumours of\r\nconspiracy, especially in the north, where the Earls of Shrewsbury and\r\nDerby still clung to the Catholic faith, were circulated, and fears of\r\na French invasion were not entirely without foundation. A new Act of\r\nUniformity[65] was decreed (1552) threatening spiritual and temporal\r\npunishments against laymen who neglected to attend common prayer on\r\nSundays and holidays. Acts were passed for the relief of the poor who\r\nhad been rendered destitute by the suppression of the monasteries and\r\nthe wholesale inclosures, and to comfort the married clergy, whose\r\nchildren were still regarded commonly as illegitimate, a second\r\nmeasure was passed legalising such unions. Fighting in churches and\r\nchurchyards was to be put down with a heavy hand. If spiritual\r\npunishments could not suffice for the maintenance of order offenders\r\nwere to be deprived of an ear or branded on the cheek with a red hot\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThough according to some the Book of Common Prayer had been compiled\r\nunder the guidance of the Holy Ghost, soon it came to be regarded by\r\nmany as unsatisfactory. The men, who had rejected the authority of the\r\nPope because he was a foreigner to follow the teaching of apostate\r\nfriars from Switzerland, Italy, Poland, and Germany, clamoured for its\r\nrevision on the ground that it seemed to uphold the Real and Corporeal\r\nPresence of Christ in the Eucharist. Cranmer, who had accepted\r\nTransubstantiation in the days of Henry VIII., and had defended a kind\r\nof Real Presence in 1549, veered gradually towards Calvin's teaching\r\non the Eucharist. In order to remove the ambiguities and difficulties\r\nof the old Prayer Book, it was determined to subject it to a complete\r\nrevision by which everything that implied a real objective presence of\r\nChrist in the Eucharist should be omitted. The second Book of Common\r\nPrayer was submitted and approved by Parliament (1552), and its use\r\nwas authorised by royal proclamation. It was to come into force in\r\nNovember 1552, but late in September, when some copies of the Book\r\nwere already printed, the council issued a command that the work\r\nshould be stopped until further corrections had been made. It seems\r\nthat by a new rubric inserted by Cranmer communicants were enjoined to\r\nreceive the communion on bended knees, and John Knox, who had arrived\r\nlately in England and was high in the favour of the council, objected\r\nstrongly to such an injunction as flavouring of papistry.\r\nNotwithstanding the spirited remonstrances of Cranmer, the council\r\nwithout authority from Parliament or Convocation obliged him to insert\r\non a fly leaf the famous \"Black Rubric\" which remains in the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer till the present day, except that in the time of Charles\r\nII. a change was made, by which \"corporeal presence\" was inserted in\r\nplace of the \"real and essential presence\" repudiated in the first\r\nform of the rubric.[66]\r\n\r\nOne other matter was considered by Cranmer as necessary for the\r\nsuccess of the new religious settlement, namely, the publication of an\r\nauthoritative creed for the English Church. The great diversity of\r\nopinion in the country, the frantic appeals of men like Hooper who had\r\ntried in vain to make an unwilling clergy accept their own dogmatic\r\nstandard, and the striking success of the Council of Trent in\r\nvindicating Catholic doctrine, made it necessary to show the English\r\npeople what could be done by the supreme head of the Church at home\r\neven though he was only a helpless boy. In 1549 Cranmer drew up a\r\nseries of Articles to be accepted by all preachers in his diocese.\r\nThese he submitted to the body of the bishops in 1551, and later at\r\nthe request of the privy council to a commission of six amongst whom\r\nwas John Knox. They were returned with annotations to Cranmer, who\r\nhaving revised them besought the council to authorise their\r\npublication. Finally in June 1553 Edward VI., four weeks before his\r\ndeath, approved them, and commanded that they should be accepted by\r\nall his subjects. The /Forty-two Articles/ represented the first\r\nattempt to provide the English Church with a distinct dogmatic creed.\r\nIn the title page it was stated that the Articles had been agreed upon\r\n\"by the bishops and other learned and godly men in the last\r\nConvocation held in London in the year of Our Lord 1552\"; but\r\nnotwithstanding this very explicit statement, it is now practically\r\ncertain that the Articles were never submitted to or approved by\r\nConvocation. In other words, as Gairdner puts it,[67] the title page\r\nis \"nothing but a shameful piece of official mendacity\" resorted to in\r\norder to deceive the people, and to prevent them from being influenced\r\nby the successful work accomplished by the Fathers of Trent.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Northumberland, who had scrambled into power on the\r\nshoulders of the Catholic party, deserted his former allies, and went\r\nover completely to the party of Cranmer, Ridley, and Hooper. Taking\r\nadvantage of England's peaceful relations with France and Scotland and\r\nof the difficulties of the Emperor in Germany, he had risked\r\neverything to make England a Protestant nation. He had removed the\r\nbishops whose influence he feared, and had packed the episcopal bench\r\nwith his own nominees. He had destroyed the altars and burned the\r\nmissals to show his contempt for the Mass, and his firm resolve to\r\nuproot the religious beliefs of the English people. So determined were\r\nhe and his friends to enforce the new religious service that even the\r\nPrincess Mary was forbidden to have Mass celebrated in her presence,\r\nand her chaplains were prosecuted for disobeying the king's law. Once\r\nindeed the Emperor felt it necessary to intervene in defence of his\r\nkinswoman, and to warn the council that if any attempt were made to\r\nprevent her from worshipping as she pleased, he would feel it\r\nnecessary to recall his ambassador and to declare war (1551). The\r\nsituation was decidedly embarrassing, and the council resolved to seek\r\nthe advice of Cranmer, Ridley, and Hooper. The bishops replied that\r\nthough to give licence to sin was sinful Mary's disobedience might be\r\nwinked at for the time.[68] The suggestion was followed by the\r\ncouncil, but later on when the Emperor's hands were tied by the\r\ntroubles in Germany, the attempt to overawe the princess was renewed.\r\nMary, however, showed the true Tudor spirit of independence, and, as\r\nit would have been dangerous to imprison her or to behead her, she was\r\nnot pushed to extremes.\r\n\r\nIn 1553 it was clear to Northumberland that Edward VI. could not long\r\nsurvive, and that with his death and the succession of Mary, his own\r\nfuture and the future of the religious settlement for which he had\r\nstriven would be gravely imperilled. In defiance therefore of the late\r\nking's will, and of what he knew to be the wishes of the English\r\npeople, for all through Edward's reign the Princess Mary was a great\r\nfavourite with the nation, he determined to secure the succession for\r\nLady Jane Grey, the grand-daughter of Henry VIII.'s sister Mary. Such\r\na succession, he imagined, would guarantee his own safety and the\r\ntriumph of Protestantism, more especially as he took care to bring\r\nabout a marriage between the prospective queen and his son, Lord\r\nGuildford Dudley. When everything had been arranged the Chief Justice\r\nand the two leading law officers of the crown were summoned to the\r\nbedside of the dying king, and instructed to draw up a deed altering\r\nthe succession. They implored the king to abandon such a project, and\r\npointed out that it was illegal and would involve everyone concerned\r\nin it in the guilt of treason, but Northumberland's violence overcame\r\ntheir scruples, particularly as their own safety was assured by a\r\ncommission under the great seal and a promise of pardon. When the\r\ndocument was drawn up it was signed by the king, the judges, and the\r\nmembers of the council. Cranmer hesitated on the ground that he had\r\nsworn to uphold the will of Henry VIII., but as the situation was a\r\ndesperate one, he agreed finally to follow the example that had been\r\nset (June 1553). The preachers were instructed to prepare the people\r\nfor the change by denouncing both Mary and Elizabeth as bastards. On\r\nthe 6th July Edward VI. died at Greenwich, but his death was kept a\r\nsecret until Northumberland's plans could be matured. Four days later\r\nLady Jane Grey arrived in London, and the proclamation of her\r\naccession to the throne was received with ominous silence in the\r\nstreets of the capital.\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] /The Life and Death of Thomas Wolsey, written by one of his\r\n    Servants/; ed. by Simpson, 1901.

Efforts had been made to induce her to come to London, but\r\nwarned by secret messages dispatched by her London friends, she fled\r\nfrom her residence in Hundon to a castle in Suffolk, from which she\r\naddressed letters to the council and to the prominent noblemen of\r\nEngland asserting her rights to the throne. From all parts of the\r\ncountry thousands flocked to join her standard, while the frantic\r\nappeals of Northumberland and his colleagues failed to awaken any\r\ngenuine response even in London itself. Northumberland, much against\r\nhis will, consented to lead the army against Mary, who was advancing\r\ntowards the capital, but after his departure, the members of the\r\ncouncil, convinced that their cause was hopeless, deserted their\r\nleader, and permitted Mary to be proclaimed (19th July).\r\nNorthumberland surrendered himself to the mercy of the new queen, and\r\nwas committed to the Tower together with his principal adherents. On\r\nthe 3rd August Mary made her formal entrance into London where she\r\nreceived an enthusiastic welcome from the citizens. Her first care was\r\nto liberate some of those who had been arrested during the previous\r\nreign, Bishops Gardiner, Bonner, Heath, and Day, the Duke of Norfolk,\r\nand Lord Courtenay, the latter of whom had been in confinement for\r\nfifteen years. As a fervent Catholic, who had upheld the Mass in the\r\ndays of Edward VI. even at the risk of her life, there could be no\r\ndoubt about the new queen's religious views, and in many of the\r\nchurches in London and throughout the country the English service gave\r\nplace immediately to the Mass. In an interview with the lord mayor of\r\nLondon, and afterwards in the public proclamation addressed to all her\r\nsubjects, she announced that, though it was her intention to follow\r\nthe Catholic religion, she had no desire of resorting to compulsion to\r\nforce it on her people against their will, and she exhorted them to\r\nlive together in Christian harmony, avoiding the \"new found devilish\r\nterms of papist and heretic.\" As a sign that vengeance and cruelty\r\nwere no part of her programme she exercised great mercy towards those\r\nwho had conspired to deprive her of the throne, only a few of whom,\r\nincluding the Earl of Northumberland, were put to death. Possibly in\r\nthe hope of playing upon the feelings of the queen and of securing a\r\npardon Northumberland announced publicly his return to the old faith\r\nand his acceptance of the Catholic doctrine on the Eucharist.\r\n\r\nCharles V., on whose counsel Mary relied, advised her to proceed\r\ncautiously with the restoration of religion in England. Many of the\r\nyounger generation had been taught to regard papal supremacy as an\r\nunwarrantable interference with English independence, while those who\r\nhad been enriched by the plunder of the Church had every reason for\r\nupholding the Edwardine settlement. For their part in promoting the\r\nconspiracy against the queen as well as for various other offences\r\nlaid to their charge Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, Latimer, and Coverdale\r\nwere committed to prison; Bishop Ponet went into hiding, and Barlow\r\nmade his escape from the country. Later on all these were deprived of\r\ntheir Sees. Gardiner was restored to his See of Winchester, and\r\nappointed Lord Chancellor, Tunstall to Durham, Heath to Worcester, Day\r\nto Chichester, and Voysey to Exeter. Foreign scholars like Peter\r\nMartyr, John à Lasco and their friends, whom Cranmer had brought over\r\nto teach the English people the new religion, were granted passports\r\nand permitted to leave the kingdom. Their example was followed by John\r\nKnox, and by many others of the married clergy.\r\n\r\nIn her heart Mary detested the title supreme head of the Church, and\r\nwas most anxious to bring about a reconciliation with Rome. When the\r\nnews of her accession reached Rome it brought joy to the heart of\r\nJulius III. He determined at once to send a legate to England, and he\r\nselected for this office the great English Cardinal, whose devotion to\r\nhis country was equalled only by his loyalty to the Church. Cardinal\r\nPole was appointed legate with full powers, and was entrusted also\r\nwith the work of effecting a reconciliation between the Emperor and\r\nHenry II. of France. Charles V. had no desire to see Pole in England\r\ninstalled as Queen Mary's chief adviser. He had planned a marriage\r\nbetween Mary and his eldest son, afterwards Philip II. of Spain, and\r\nfully conscious that Pole might oppose such an alliance as dangerous\r\nboth for England and for religion, he was determined to delay the\r\narrival of the legate until the negotiations for the marriage had been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nIn October 1553 Mary was crowned solemnly by Bishop Gardiner at\r\nWestminster Abbey. She bound herself by oath to preserve the liberties\r\nof her kingdom, and to maintain the rights of the Holy See. Four days\r\nlater she attended the Mass of the Holy Ghost at the opening of\r\nParliament, and listened to the address in which her Lord Chancellor\r\nexhorted the members to show their repentance for and detestation of\r\nthe heresy and schism of which he and they had been guilty, by\r\nreturning to the unity of the Catholic Church. All the new treasons,\r\nfelonies, and praemunire penalties of the previous reigns were\r\nabolished on the ground, it was declared, that Mary hoped to win the\r\nobedience of her subjects through love rather than through fear. The\r\nmarriage of Henry VIII. with Catharine of Aragon was declared valid,\r\nand consequently Mary was acknowledged as the lawful successor to the\r\nthrone. The Edwardine religious settlement, including the Acts of\r\nUniformity, the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal, the Forty-two\r\nArticles and the permission for clergymen to marry, was swept away,\r\nand an Act was passed against disturbing religious services or\r\nexhibiting irreverence towards the Eucharist. All this legislation was\r\nin perfect conformity with the wishes of Convocation, which had met\r\nshortly after the meeting of Parliament, and which with only a few\r\ndissentients condemned the Book of Common Prayer, and re-affirmed the\r\nbelief of the English clergy in the doctrine of Transubstantiation.\r\nThough the queen announced her dissatisfaction with the title of\r\nsupreme head, and granted full freedom of discussion regarding it,\r\nParliament showed itself decidedly unwilling to restore the\r\njurisdiction of the Pope. It was not that the members had any real\r\nobjection to the change from the doctrinal point of view, but, fearing\r\nthat a return to Roman obedience might involve a restoration of the\r\necclesiastical property seized or alienated during the previous reign,\r\nthey wished to secure their property before they made their submission\r\nto the Pope.\r\n\r\nFor so far Mary had acted with considerable mildness and prudence in\r\ncarrying out her religious programme, against which as yet no serious\r\nopposition had been manifested. The question of her marriage, however,\r\nwas destined to create dissension between herself and her subjects.\r\nThe Emperor and the imperial ambassador urged her to accept the hand\r\nof Philip, on the ground that by such a marriage internal jealousies\r\nand dissensions might be avoided, and the triumph of Catholicism might\r\nbe assured. Many of the members of the council and the vast majority\r\nof the English people were opposed to such a union. They feared that\r\nwere a foreign ruler to become the husband of their queen he must have\r\nof necessity the chief voice in English affairs. They believed,\r\ntherefore, that England would be involved in all the wars of Spain,\r\nand that were an heir to be born of such a union, England, instead of\r\nbeing an independent nation, might become a mere Spanish province. The\r\nenemies of Mary's religious programme thought they saw in the Spanish\r\nmarriage an opportunity of overturning her government, and of\r\nre-establishing Protestantism in the country. Taking advantage of the\r\nunpopularity of this proposal they appealed to the patriotism and love\r\nof independence of the English people, and succeeded in winning to\r\ntheir side many who were at least neutral in regard to her religious\r\nproposals. It was planned by some to bring about a marriage between\r\nthe Princess Elizabeth and Edward Courtenay, both of whom had claims\r\nto the throne, and to set them up as rivals to Queen Mary. The French\r\nambassador, alarmed at the prospect of Mary's marriage with the\r\nhereditary enemy of France, encouraged the conspirators with promises\r\nof assistance, not, indeed, because France desired the accession of\r\nElizabeth, but in the hope that during the confusion that would ensue\r\nit might be possible to assert the claims of Mary Queen of Scotland,\r\nthe prospective wife of the Dauphin of France.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the petition presented against the Spanish marriage by\r\nParliament, Mary persisted in the policy suggested to her by the\r\nEmperor. Flemish envoys arrived on New Year's Day 1554 to arrange the\r\npreliminaries. The marriage treaty was signed and two days later it\r\nwas announced to the mayor and the chief citizens of London. This was\r\nthe signal for the conspirators, who had been working secretly for\r\nmonths, to bring their designs to a head. News soon arrived in London\r\nthat Sir Peter Carew had risen in Devon and had captured Exeter, that\r\nSir Thomas Wyatt was rousing the men of Kent, and that Sir James\r\nCrofts had gone to Wales and the Duke of Suffolk to the midlands to\r\nrally the forces of disloyalty. But the great body of the English\r\npeople were too deeply attached to their sovereign to respond to the\r\nappeal of the rebel leaders. Wyatt's movement alone threatened to be\r\ndangerous. As his forces advanced to the gates of London, Mary, who\r\nhad shown the greatest courage throughout the crisis, went in person\r\nto the Guildhall to call upon the citizens of London to defend their\r\nsovereign. Her invitation was responded to with enthusiasm, and when\r\nWyatt had succeeded in forcing his way as far as Ludgate Circus, he\r\nwas obliged to retire and to surrender himself a prisoner to the\r\nqueen's forces. Mary, who for so far had followed a policy of extreme\r\nmildness, felt that she could do so no longer, and that she must make\r\nit clear to her subjects that to declare war on the throne was a\r\nserious crime. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, father of Lady Jane Grey,\r\nand several of the leaders were tried and put to death. Already in\r\nNovember Lady Jane Grey, her husband and Cranmer had been condemned to\r\ndeath as traitors. The sentence was not, however, carried out, nor was\r\nit likely to have been, had not the rebellion shown that Mary's\r\nenemies might utilise such dangerous claimants to the throne for\r\nstirring up new disaffection. Lady Jane Grey[1] and her husband were\r\nput to death on Tower Hill (Feb. 1554); several of the other\r\nconspirators were punished only by imprisonment, and a general pardon\r\nwas published for the great body of the insurgents. Mary's treatment\r\nof the offenders, however the execution of Lady Jane Grey may be\r\nregarded, was in striking contrast to what might have been expected to\r\nhave taken place in similar circumstances had the throne been occupied\r\nby her father or even by her sister Elizabeth. From the confessions of\r\nsome of the rebels as well as from the correspondence of the French\r\nambassador serious evidence was furnished to show that Elizabeth was\r\nimplicated in the rebellion. She was summoned to London to answer the\r\ncharges brought against her, and though she protested her innocence\r\nshe was committed to the Tower. Many members of the council were\r\nconvinced of her guilt, but Mary, refusing to believe that her sister\r\nwas privy to the designs of the conspirators, ordered her release.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the marriage treaty having been confirmed by Parliament\r\n(April 1554) Philip arrived in England, and on the 25th July the\r\nmarriage was celebrated in Westminster Abbey. Philip and Mary were\r\nproclaimed \"by the grace of God King and Queen of England, France,\r\nNaples, Jerusalem, and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Princes of\r\nSpain and Sicily, Arch-Dukes of Austria, Dukes of Milan, Burgundy and\r\nBrabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders, and Tyrol.\" The Emperor had at\r\nlast carried his point, and, as the presence of Cardinal Pole in\r\nEngland could no longer prove a danger to his designs, the latter was\r\nnow free to come to England. During the early portions of the year\r\nsteps had been taken to prepare England for the worthy reception of\r\nthe papal legate. In March four of the reforming bishops were deprived\r\nof their Sees on the ground that they were married, and three others\r\nwho held their appointments only by letters patent of Edward VI. were\r\nremoved. On the 1st April six new bishops were consecrated by Gardiner\r\nto fill the vacant Sees. Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley were sent down\r\nto Oxford to defend their views in a public discussion, arranged\r\nundoubtedly with the object of forwarding the national reconciliation\r\nwith Rome. There were still, however, difficulties that must be\r\nremoved before Cardinal Pole could be allowed to land on English soil.\r\nThe real objection to the return of England to the Roman obedience was\r\nthe ownership of the Church lands, and from what had happened in the\r\ntwo previous sessions it was perfectly clear that those who had\r\nbenefited by the plunder of the Church lands were determined to refuse\r\nto make restoration. After prolonged negotiations Pole agreed that,\r\nwhile the Pope could not approve of what had been done, he would not\r\ninsist on the restoration of ecclesiastical property.\r\n\r\nWhen everything had been arranged Parliament was summoned to meet in\r\nNovember 1554. The sheriffs were instructed to see that men \"of the\r\nwise, grave and Catholic sort\" should be returned. An Act was passed\r\nimmediately reversing the sentence of Attainder against Cardinal Pole.\r\nThe legate hastened on his way to London where he was welcomed by the\r\nKing and Queen and Parliament. A supplication was adopted unanimously\r\nin the House of Lords, and with but one dissentient in the House of\r\nCommons, requesting the King and Queen to procure from the legate\r\nabsolution from heresy and schism for the English people and a\r\nreconciliation of the nation with the Pope. Cardinal Pole attended\r\nParliament on the 30th to pronounce the sentence of absolution, which\r\nwas received by the King, Queen, Lords, and Commons on bended knees.\r\nThis happy event was celebrated by a procession through the streets of\r\nLondon in which the clergymen, aldermen, and citizens took part.\r\nParliament petitioned that the old jurisdiction of the clergy should\r\nbe restored, that the liberty granted to the Church by the Magna\r\nCharta should be confirmed, and that the English religious service-\r\nbooks of the previous reign should be delivered to the flames. Once it\r\nwas made clear that the owners of ecclesiastical property should not\r\nbe disturbed there was no difficulty in procuring a complete reversal\r\nof all the laws that had been passed against the apostolic See of Rome\r\nsince the twentieth year of Henry VIII. (3rd January 1555).[2]\r\n\r\nThe close connexion of the leaders of the Reformers with the late\r\nrebellion, the ugly pamphlets that made their way into England from\r\nFrankfurt and Geneva, the fact that prayers were offered in secret for\r\nthe speedy death of the queen, that a shot had been fired at one of\r\nthe royal preachers while he was in the pulpit, and that a violent\r\ncommotion was being stirred up, that led later on to a priest being\r\nstruck down at the altar by one who is designated by Foxe as \"a\r\nfaithful servant of God,\"[3] made it necessary for the safety of the\r\ncrown and the advancement of religion to deal harshly with those who\r\nthemselves had relied on persecution for the promotion of their\r\ndesigns. Mary herself, Philip, and Cardinal Pole did not favour a\r\nrecourse to violent measures, but they were overruled by the judgment\r\nof those who should have known best the character of the opponents\r\nwith whom they had to deal. An Act was passed renewing the legislation\r\nthat had been made in the reigns of Richard II., Henry IV., and Henry\r\nV. for the suppression of the Lollard heresy.\r\n\r\nParliament was dissolved in January 1555, and several of the political\r\nprisoners were released from the Tower. The heretical leaders, who\r\nthough under arrest had been treated with great mildness and allowed\r\nsuch liberty that they were able to meet together and to publish\r\nwritings and challenges against Mary's religious policy,[4] were\r\nbrought to trial before a commission presided over by Gardiner. A few\r\nconsented to sign a formula of recantation, but the majority,\r\npersisting in their opposition, were degraded and handed over for\r\npunishment to the civil authorities. On the 4th February the long\r\nseries of burnings began. John Rogers was committed to the flames in\r\nSmithfield, Bishop Hooper in Gloucester, Taylor in Suffolk, Saunders\r\nin Coventry, and before the year had elapsed about seventy prisoners\r\nhad met a similar fate. In September 1555 a commission was sent down\r\nto Oxford to examine Latimer and Ridley. Both refused to admit\r\nTransubstantiation, the sacrificial character of the Mass, or Roman\r\nsupremacy. They were condemned, and it must be said of them that they\r\nmet their fate like men. Judges were appointed by the Pope to take\r\nevidence against Cranmer. He was charged with perjury because he had\r\nbroken his oath to the Pope, with heresy on account of his teaching\r\nagainst the Eucharist, and with adultery. The minutes of the trial\r\nwere forwarded to Rome for the final decision, and after careful\r\nconsideration the Pope deposed him from the Archbishopric of\r\nCanterbury, and excommunicated him. Meanwhile Cranmer's theological\r\nviews had been undergoing another revision. On the question of prayers\r\nfor the dead, Purgatory, and the Mass, he was willing to admit that he\r\nmight have been mistaken, and even on the question of papal supremacy\r\nhe professed himself ready to listen to argument. In his eagerness to\r\nescape punishment he signed recantation after recantation, each of\r\nthem more comprehensive and more submissive than its predecessor,\r\nacknowledging his guilt as a persecutor of the Church and a disturber\r\nof the faith of the English nation, and praying for pardon from the\r\nsovereigns, the Pope, and God. But in the end, when he realised that\r\nhis recantations could not save him and that he was face to face with\r\ndeath, he deceived his chaplains at the last moment as he had deceived\r\nmany others, by withdrawing his previous admissions and announcing\r\nthat he still clung to his heretical views[5] (21st March 1556).\r\n\r\nAn embassy had been sent to Rome to inform the Pope that England had\r\nreturned to the Holy See. The envoys reported, too, that though Mary\r\nhad failed to secure a restoration of the ecclesiastical lands, she\r\nhad at least set a good example to the lay usurpers by returning the\r\npossessions of the Church still held by the crown. The synod summoned\r\nby Cardinal Pole to restore the discipline of the Church in England,\r\nmet in November 1555. It was agreed in the synod that the 30th\r\nNovember should be kept as a national holiday in memory of the\r\nreconciliation of England to the Church, that the decrees binding in\r\nEngland before the troubles began under Henry VIII. should be\r\nenforced, that the clergy should be mindful of their duties of\r\nresidence and preaching, that seminaries should be set up in each\r\ndiocese for the education of the clergy, that bishops should hold\r\nfrequent visitations, that a set of homilies should be compiled for\r\nthe guidance of preachers, and that an English version of the\r\nScriptures should be published without delay.[6] This new code of\r\nconstitutions issued under the title /Reformatio Angliae ex decretis\r\nReginaldi Pole/ is in itself a testimony to the ability, moderation,\r\nand prudence of the papal legate. Some months later he was\r\nconsecrated bishop and took possession of the See of Canterbury to\r\nwhich he had been appointed on the deposition of Cranmer. In pursuance\r\nof her plans for the complete re-establishment of the Catholic\r\nreligion the queen took steps to ensure that the monastic\r\ninstitutions, which had been suppressed during the previous reigns,\r\nshould begin to make their appearance once more in England. The\r\nCarthusians returned to London, the Grey Friars occupied a house at\r\nGreenwich, the Dominicans took possession of St. Bartholomew's, and\r\nthe Benedictines were installed in Westminster (1556).\r\n\r\nThe queen, who two years before had been full of courage and hope,\r\nbegan to lose confidence in the success of her work. The Spanish\r\nmarriage was the beginning of her misfortunes, and the apparent\r\ndependence of Catholicism on Spanish help proved to be the undoing of\r\nthe Catholic religion in England. Disappointed in the birth of an\r\nheir, deserted by her husband who found enough to engage his attention\r\nin Spain and the Netherlands, confronted with conspiracies promoted by\r\nheretics and encouraged for its own selfish purpose by France,\r\ndoubtful of the real sentiments of Elizabeth, and with hardly any\r\nfriends upon whose advice she could rely with confidence, it is not to\r\nbe wondered at that Mary felt inclined to despair. She was determined,\r\nhowever, to continue the work she had begun, and to see that at least\r\nduring her life heresy should be put down with a heavy hand.\r\nUnfortunately for the success of her projects she was involved in\r\ndifficulties with Rome. Paul IV. (1555-59) was a man of stern,\r\nunbending character, firmly resolved to maintain the rights and\r\nliberties of the Holy See. Annoyed at the domineering policy of\r\nCharles V., and of his son Philip II., he was anxious to put an end to\r\nSpanish rule in Naples. The relations became so embittered that a\r\nSpanish force under the command of the Duke of Alva crossed the\r\nfrontiers of the Papal States, and Paul IV. recalled his agents from\r\nPhilip's territories (1557). France decided to support the Pope, and\r\nsoon active hostilities began. Philip, for whose return to England\r\nMary had so often appealed in vain, came back early in 1557, but only\r\nto request that England should join with him in a war with France.\r\n\r\nMary's position was a particularly cruel one. She could not well\r\nresist the demands of her husband, particularly as France had lent its\r\npatronage and assistance to the conspiracies plotted for her\r\noverthrow. The position of Cardinal Pole was even more cruel. He had\r\ndone all that man could do to prevent the outbreak of war, and when\r\nall his efforts proved unavailing, he retired from court lest he, a\r\nlegate of the Holy See, should be obliged to meet Philip who was at\r\nwar with the Pope. By the papal order (1557) recalling all his agents\r\nfrom the Spanish territories the Cardinal found himself deprived of\r\nthe office of legate, to the astonishment of his friends and the grief\r\nof the queen. Agents were dispatched to Rome to induce Paul IV. to\r\ncancel the legate's recall. The Pope, however, having taken some time\r\nfor consideration refused to accede to the request, but agreed to send\r\na new legate in the person of the Observant, Friar William Peto (14\r\nJune 1557), who had preached so manfully against Henry's divorce, and\r\nwho was now created cardinal to prepare him for his new position. The\r\nmessenger dispatched to announce these tidings was refused admission\r\ninto England, although Pole who had learned of what had taken place in\r\nRome refused to act any longer as legate, and addressed a strong but\r\nrespectful letter of remonstrance to the Pope. Both from the point of\r\nview of religion and of politics the French war, in which Mary's\r\nhusband had succeeded in involving England, proved disastrous. It led\r\nto the loss of Calais and Guisnes (1558) the last of the English\r\npossessions in France, to increased taxation, and to a strong feeling\r\nagainst Mary and all her counsellors. Distrust of the Spanish alliance\r\nled to distrust of the religion of which Philip had constituted\r\nhimself the champion, and helped to forward the schemes of those who\r\nsought to identify patriotism with Protestantism. Though the great\r\nbody of the people had accepted the Catholic religion, and though to\r\nall appearances its restoration was complete, Mary's last days were\r\nembittered by the thought that under the reign of her successor the\r\nreligious settlement that had been effected might be overturned.\r\nAlready courtiers and diplomatists were abandoning her presence to win\r\nfavour with Elizabeth, who professed to be a sincere Catholic, but on\r\nwhose professions too much reliance could not be placed. On November\r\n17th 1558 Mary passed away, and a few hours later her great counsellor\r\nand friend Cardinal Pole was called to his reward.\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] Taylor, /Life of Lady Jane Grey/, 1908.\r\n\r\n[2] Dodd-Tierney, ii., App. xxv.\r\n\r\n[3] Gairdner, /Heretics Painted mostly by Themselves/, op. cit., iv.,\r\n    305 sqq.\r\n\r\n[4] Gairdner, /Hist. of Eng.

During the reign of her brother her relations with Thomas\r\nSeymour nearly led to a secret marriage and the loss of her rights to\r\nthe throne, while during the lifetime of her sister the disclosures of\r\nWyatt and his followers and the correspondence of the French\r\nambassador brought her to the Tower on suspicion of treason. Mary was,\r\nhowever, averse to severe measures, more especially as Elizabeth\r\nexpressed her devotion to the Catholic religion and her willingness to\r\naccept the new religious settlement. But in secret she treasured other\r\nviews, not because she was hostile to the Catholic religion, but\r\nbecause opposition to Catholicism seemed to be the best means of\r\nmaintaining her claim to the crown and of resisting Mary Queen of\r\nScots, who from the Catholic point of view was the nearest legitimate\r\nheir to the throne. Already, before the death of Mary, Elizabeth was\r\nin close correspondence with those who were unfriendly to Catholicism\r\nand to the Spanish connexion, and she had selected William Cecil,\r\nwhose religious views and practices during Mary's reign coincided with\r\nher own, to be her secretary. Her accession was hailed with joy\r\nthroughout England, for Englishmen were glad to have a ruler of their\r\nown so as to be rid of the Spanish domination, that had led to\r\ntaxation at home and disaster abroad. The official announcement of\r\nElizabeth's accession was as welcome to Philip II., who was still\r\nEngland's ally, as it was distasteful to France, which regarded Mary\r\nQueen of Scots as the lawful claimant to England's throne. It is\r\nnoteworthy, as affording a clue to Elizabeth's future policy, that no\r\nofficial notice of her accession was forwarded to the Pope, nor were\r\nthe credentials of the English ambassador at Rome either confirmed or\r\nrevoked. Paul IV., notwithstanding the efforts of the French, was\r\nunwilling to create any difficulties for England's new ruler by\r\ndeclaring her illegitimate or by treating her otherwise than as a\r\nrightful sovereign.[1]\r\n\r\nThough many of Mary's old councillors were retained it is remarked by\r\nmany interested observers that the new members selected by the queen\r\nbelonged to the party likely to favour religious innovations, and that\r\nher real advisers were not the privy council but a select coterie, the\r\nprincipal of which were William Cecil, Secretary of State, and his\r\nbrother-in-law, Nicholas Bacon, appointed Lord Keeper of the Seal,\r\nboth of whom, while outwardly professing their devotion to the old\r\nreligion under Queen Mary, were well known to sympathise with the\r\nEdwardian régime. The men who had fled to Frankfurt or Geneva began to\r\nreturn and to preach their doctrines to the crowd, and the Italian\r\nchurch in London was attacked by a mob. Outwardly no change took place\r\nin the religious ceremonial. A royal proclamation was issued (27th\r\nDec., 1558) forbidding preaching or the use of other public prayers,\r\nrites, or ceremonies save those approved by law until Parliament\r\nshould have determined otherwise, except in regard to the recitation\r\nin English, of the Litany, the Commandments, the Creed, together with\r\nthe Epistles and Gospels.[2] Still the anti-Catholic party boasted\r\nthat the new ruler was on their side. The queen's own inclinations\r\nwere soon made clear by her prohibition addressed to Bishop Oglethorp\r\nof Carlisle against the elevation of the Host in the Mass celebrated\r\nin her presence on Christmas Day (1558), and by her withdrawal from\r\nthe church when he refused to obey her instructions. Bishop\r\nChristopherson of Chichester was arrested for his sermon preached on\r\nthe occasion of the late queen's funeral, and Archbishop Heath of York\r\nresigned the Chancellorship.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of the queen was fixed for the 25th January (1559), and\r\nas her title to the throne might be questioned on so many points, it\r\nwas obviously of the greatest importance that the ceremony should be\r\ncarried out in the orthodox fashion so as to elude all the objections\r\nof her rivals. The Archbishop of York and the bishops generally, well\r\naware of the religious changes that were in contemplation, refused to\r\ntake part in the coronation, though in the end Bishop Oglethorp of\r\nCarlisle was induced to undertake the task, probably in the hope of\r\naverting still greater evil. The bishops attended at Westminster to\r\nwelcome the queen on her arrival and to take the oath of allegiance,\r\nbut declined to be present at the Mass, as did also the Spanish\r\nambassador. The rite was carried out with punctilious attention to the\r\nold rubrics, and the sermon was preached by Dr. Cox, a Frankfurt\r\nexile, who regaled his hearers with a wild tirade against the monks,\r\nclergy, and the existing idolatry.[3]\r\n\r\nParliament was summoned to meet in January 1559. In the House of Lords\r\nthe government was confronted with the fact that the bishops to a man\r\nwould oppose the religious changes that were to be introduced, but it\r\nwas hoped that by careful directions to the sheriffs a House of\r\nCommons might be returned that could be trusted.[4] There was no\r\ndifficulty in procuring acts confirming Elizabeth's title to the\r\nthrone, more especially as the legitimacy of her mother's marriage\r\nthough implied was not directly affirmed, but the bill for the\r\nrestoration of First Fruits to the crown met with considerable\r\nopposition and delay, especially at the hands of the spiritual peers,\r\nand another for the restoration of those clergymen who had been\r\ndeprived in the previous reign on account of their non-observance of\r\ncelibacy was abandoned. The two great measures however on which\r\nElizabeth's ministers had set their hearts were royal supremacy and\r\nthe re-introduction of the Book of Common Prayer in place of the Latin\r\nMass, but from the first the bishops offered to these measures the\r\nmost determined opposition, and though the bishops were not supported\r\nby a very large number of the lay peers, the idea of forcing such\r\nmomentous changes on the country against the wishes of the united\r\nepiscopate was so repugnant to the religious instincts of the nation\r\nthat the ministers found themselves again and again compelled to\r\nwithdraw or modify their proposals.\r\n\r\nTo add to their confusion Convocation met in February (1559) and\r\nforwarded to the bishops for presentation to the queen a strong\r\ndocument, in which the clergy without a dissentient voice affirmed\r\ntheir belief in the Real Presence, Transubstantiation, the sacrificial\r\ncharacter of the Mass, Roman supremacy and the inability of laymen to\r\nlegislate regarding the doctrines, discipline, or sacraments of the\r\nChurch.[5] This judgment of Convocation though hardly unexpected was a\r\ndeadly blow struck against the government measures, showing as it did\r\nthat if Parliament undertook a new religious settlement it must do so\r\non its own responsibility and against the wishes of the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities. The difficulties against the two bills were so great that\r\nwhen Easter arrived the work upon which the queen and her advisers had\r\nset their hearts was still incomplete. The Bill of Uniformity of\r\nbelief had been rejected, and though the Royal Supremacy Bill had\r\npassed the two Houses in modified form it had not yet reached the\r\nstatute book. The inconvenience of according the title of supreme head\r\nof the Church to a woman was disliked by many, and was distasteful\r\neven to Elizabeth herself.\r\n\r\nParliament was prorogued for a few weeks at Easter, and recourse was\r\nhad to a clever expedient to win popular sympathy for the measures. A\r\ndisputation was arranged to take place between the bishops and the\r\nProtestant exiles. Cecil took care that both in regard to the subjects\r\nto be discussed and the manner of procedure the latter party should\r\nhave every advantage. The questions were the use of English or Latin\r\nin the religious services, the authority of particular churches to\r\nchange their rites and ceremonies, and the propitiatory character of\r\nthe Mass. The Catholic representatives were to open the discussion\r\neach day, but the last word was always reserved for the Reformers.\r\nFrom the very beginning it was clear that the dice had been loaded\r\nagainst the defenders of the old faith, and on the second day the\r\nCatholic party refused to continue the discussion.[6] Their refusal,\r\nhowever justified it may have been in the circumstances, could not\r\nfail to make a bad impression. It was seized upon by their opponents\r\nto show that the supporters of Rome had disobeyed the queen, had\r\nquailed before the apostles of the new religion, and that, therefore,\r\neven though they were bishops, they could not be regarded as\r\ntrustworthy guides in matters of religion. The Bishops of Winchester\r\nand Lincoln were arrested because they refused to continue the\r\ndisputation, and by their arrest the Catholic peers were deprived of\r\ntwo votes in the House of Lords at a time when the fate of the old\r\nreligion was trembling in the balance.\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament re-assembled the queen announced her intention of\r\nrefusing the title of supreme head of the Church, and requested the\r\nHouse \"would devise some other form with regard to the primacy or\r\nsupremacy.\" A new bill conceding to the sovereign the title \"supreme\r\ngovernor\" was introduced, but met with as strong opposition from the\r\nbishops as its predecessors, and was passed against their unanimous\r\nwishes. The Act of Uniformity, commanding the use of the Second Book\r\nof Common Prayer with a few alterations, met with even a worse\r\nreception, as several of the laymen joined the bishops in their\r\nresistance, and in the end it was carried only by a majority of three.\r\nHad the imprisoned bishops been free to cast their votes against the\r\nmeasure, or had the lay peers who disliked it had the courage to be\r\npresent in their places at the division the whole course of English\r\nhistory might have been altered.[7] As it was a religious revolution\r\nhad been effected. The Mass, Transubstantiation, the Real Presence and\r\nRoman supremacy, all of which had been accepted without contradiction\r\nfrom the days of St. Augustine till the reign of Henry VIII., were\r\nabolished and a new church established that bore but a faint\r\nresemblance to the old. And what was more extraordinary still, all\r\nthis was done solely by an assembly of laymen, against the wishes and\r\nappeals of the united episcopate and against the practically unanimous\r\njudgment of Convocation. \"The Church of England as by law established\"\r\nis a parliamentary institution set up and shaped by Parliament in the\r\nbeginning, and dependent upon Parliament ever since for guidance and\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of Supremacy the queen was declared to be supreme governor\r\nof the Church in England; all foreign jurisdiction was abolished; a\r\nbody of commissioners was to be appointed to administer the oath of\r\nsupremacy and to carry on ecclesiastical functions in the name of the\r\nqueen; officials who refused to take the oath were to be deprived, and\r\npenalties varying from fines to death were to be imposed on those who\r\nwere unwilling to accept the law. By the Act of Uniformity the English\r\nservice, as contained in the Second Book of Common Prayer with some\r\nslight alterations, was made obligatory on all clergymen, as was\r\nattendance at this service on all laymen. The Act was to be enforced\r\nby the spiritual authorities under threat of excommunication against\r\noffenders, and by the civil authorities by the infliction of fines or\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nA royal commission was appointed (1559) to administer the oath of\r\nsupremacy to the clergy, and to enforce the provisions of the Act of\r\nUniformity. As was to be expected, the attention of the commissioners\r\nwas directed immediately to the bishops. If some of them could be\r\ninduced to submit--and the government was not without hope in this\r\ndirection--their submission would produce a good impression on the\r\ncountry; but if on the contrary they persisted in their attachment to\r\nthe Mass and their obedience to the Pope, they must be removed to make\r\nway for more trustworthy men. To their credit be it said, when the\r\noath of supremacy was tendered to the bishops they refused with one\r\nexception to abandon the views they had defended with such skill and\r\nbravery in the House of Lords, and preferred to suffer imprisonment\r\nand deprivation rather than lead their people into error by\r\nsubmission. Bishop Kitchin of Llandaff had opposed royal supremacy for\r\na time. The Spanish ambassador reported to his master that he was\r\nabout to follow the example of his brethren, but in the end he\r\nsubmitted and consented to administer the oath to his clergy.[8] The\r\nreligious communities, the Observants, the Carthusians, the\r\nDominicans, the Benedictines, and the few communities of nuns that had\r\nre-established houses in England during the reign of Queen Mary, were\r\nsuppressed; their property was seized according to an Act passed in\r\nthe late Parliament, and many of the monks and nuns were obliged to\r\ndepart from the kingdom. The commissioners proceeded through England\r\nadministering the oath to the clergy, a large percentage of whom seems\r\nto have submitted. From the returns preserved it is difficult to\r\nestimate accurately what number of the clergy consented to acknowledge\r\nthe supremacy of the queen or to abandon the Mass, but it is certainly\r\nnot true to say that out of 9,000 beneficed clergymen in England at\r\nthe time only about 200 refused the oath. On the one hand, the\r\ndisturbances during the reigns of Henry VIII. and Edward VI. had\r\nreduced considerably the number of priests in England, while on the\r\nother, the fact that several clergymen did not put in an appearance\r\nbefore the commission, that others were allowed time to reconsider\r\ntheir views, and that not even all those who obstinately refused the\r\noath were deprived, shows clearly that the lists of deprivations\r\nafford no sure clue to the number of those who were unwilling to\r\naccept the change. It is noteworthy that the greatest number of\r\nrefusals were met with amongst the higher officials or dignitaries of\r\nthe Church, the deans, archdeacons, and canons, who might be expected\r\nto represent the best educated and most exemplary of the clergy of\r\ntheir time in England. In the universities, too, the commissioners met\r\nwith the strongest resistance. Several of the heads of the colleges,\r\nboth in Cambridge and Oxford, the fellows and the office-bearers,\r\neither were deprived or fled, and men of the new school were appointed\r\nto take their places. But notwithstanding all the government could do,\r\nthe universities, and particularly Oxford, continued during the\r\ngreater part of the reign of Elizabeth to be centres of\r\ndisaffection.[9]\r\n\r\nThe complete extinction of the old hierarchy by death, deprivation and\r\nimprisonment, left the way open for the appointment of bishops\r\nfavourable to the religion. Matthew Parker, who had been chaplain to\r\nAnne Boleyn and who had lived privately since he was removed from the\r\ndeanship of Lincoln on account of his marriage, was selected to fill\r\nthe Archbishopric of Canterbury, left vacant since the death of\r\nCardinal Pole. The royal letters of approval were issued in September,\r\nand the mandate for his consecration was addressed to Tunstall of\r\nDurham, Bourne of Bath and Wells, Poole of Peterborough, Kitchin of\r\nLlandaff, together with Barlow and Scory. The three former, however,\r\nrefused to act, and apparently even Kitchin was unwilling to take any\r\npart in the ceremony. New men were then sought, and found in the\r\npersons of Barlow, Coverdale, Scory, and Hodgkin. But even still grave\r\nlegal difficulties barred the way. The conditions for the consecration\r\nof an archbishop laid down by the 25th of Henry VIII., which had not\r\nbeen repealed, could not be complied with owing to the refusal of the\r\nold bishops, and besides the use of the new Ordinal of Edward VI.\r\nwithout a special Act of Parliament for its revival was distinctly\r\nillegal; but the situation was so serious that Elizabeth's advisers\r\nurged her to make good the illegalities by an exercise of her royal\r\nauthority. In the end the consecration of Parker was carried out in\r\nthe chapel of Lambeth Palace on the morning of the 17th December,\r\n1559. The story of the Nag's Head is a pure legend used by\r\ncontroversialists for impugning the validity of Anglican Orders. As a\r\nmatter of fact the main argument against these Orders is drawn neither\r\nfrom the fable of the Nag's Head nor from the want of episcopal orders\r\nin the case of Barlow, the consecrator of Parker, though his\r\nconsecration has not been proved, but from the use of a corrupt form,\r\nwhich was then as it is now rejected as insufficient by the Catholic\r\nChurch, and from the want of the proper intention implied both by the\r\ncorruption of the form and by the teaching of those who corrupted\r\nit.[10] Once the difficulty about Parker's consecration had been\r\nsettled other bishops were appointed by the queen, and consecrated by\r\nthe new archbishop, so that before March 1560 good progress had been\r\nmade in the establishment of the new hierarchy in England.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the ecclesiastical commission (1559) to\r\nsearch out and punish heresy and generally to carry out the provisions\r\nof the Supremacy Act, and with the appointment of new bishops (1559-\r\n60) the work of reforming the faith of England was well under way.\r\nStill the new bishops were confronted with grave difficulties. From\r\nthe reports of the Spanish ambassador, who had exceptional\r\nopportunities of knowing the facts but whose opinions for obvious\r\nreasons cannot always be accepted, the great majority of the people\r\noutside London were still Catholic, and even in London itself the\r\nadherents of the old faith could not be despised. Quite apart,\r\nhowever, from his reports, sufficient evidence can be adduced from the\r\nepiscopal and official letters and documents to show that the change\r\nwas not welcomed by a great body in the country. As the best means of\r\nenforcing the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity a visitation\r\nof both provinces was arranged. In London Masses were still\r\ncelebrated, and attended by great multitudes; in Canterbury itself\r\nwithin sight of the archiepiscopal palace public religious processions\r\nwere carried out. In Winchester, where the memory of Gardiner was\r\nstill cherished, many of the clergy refused to attend the visitation;\r\nthe laymen were discreetly absent when their assent was required; the\r\nchurches were deserted and even the people attending the cathedral\r\n\"were corrupted by the clergy.\" In Hereford Bishop Scory described his\r\ncathedral, \"as a very nest of blasphemy, whoredom, pride,\r\nsuperstition, and ignorance;\" the justices threw every obstacle in the\r\nway of his reforms; fasts and feasts were observed as of old; and even\r\nthe very butchers seemed leagued against him, for they refused to sell\r\nmeat on Thursdays. In Bath and Wells many of the justices were openly\r\ndisobedient, and even the people who conformed outwardly could not be\r\nrelied upon. In Norwich, Ely, Salisbury and Chichester \"Popery\" was\r\nstill strong amongst the clergy, people, and officials. At Eton it was\r\nnecessary to expel the provost and all the teachers except three\r\nbefore the college could be reduced to subjection, and at Oxford the\r\nvisitors were driven to admit, that if they expelled the fellows who\r\nrefused to subscribe, and the students who would have no religious\r\nservice except the Mass, the houses would be deserted. In the northern\r\nprovinces where the visitation did not begin till some time later it\r\nwas discovered that matters were still worse. The principal noblemen\r\nwere openly Catholic, and many of the magistrates denied that they had\r\never heard of the Act of Supremacy, while others of them \"winked and\r\nlooked through their fingers.\" In York the diocese was in a state of\r\nanarchy; in Carlisle the bishop confessed that he could not prevent\r\nthe public celebration of the Mass; in Durham the bishop wrote that he\r\nfound himself engaged in a conflict with wild beasts even more savage\r\nthan those which had confronted St. Paul at Ephesus. To make matters\r\nworse it was reported that public sympathy was on the side of the\r\nrecusants, and that hopes were being expressed by many that the\r\npresent advisers of her Majesty might soon be displaced, even though\r\nit were necessary to have recourse to France or Spain.[11]\r\n\r\nNor was it merely from the side of the Catholics that the bishops and\r\nthe government anticipated serious danger. The men, who, like Hooper,\r\nobjected to the Edwardine settlement as not being sufficiently\r\nextreme, had approached more closely to Calvinism in doctrine and in\r\nritual during their enforced sojourn at Frankfurt and Geneva. They\r\nwere enthusiastic in their praise of Elizabeth for her attacks upon\r\nRome, but they found fault with her religious programme as flavouring\r\ntoo much of idolatry and papistry. They objected to crosses, candles,\r\nvestments, copes, blessings, and much of the old ritual that had been\r\nretained in the Book of Common prayer, and insisted that, until\r\nreligion had been brought back to a state of scriptural purity, the\r\nEnglish people should not rest satisfied. Whatever sympathy some of\r\nthe English political advisers may have had with the Puritans in\r\ntheory they had no intention of yielding to their demands, as such a\r\npolicy would have stirred up all the latent Catholicity in the\r\ncountry. The official church \"as by law established\" was to be a\r\nchurch for the nation, standing midway between Rome and Puritanism, a\r\nkind of compromise between both extremes. Elizabeth was determined to\r\nput down Puritanism, irreverence, and unlicensed preaching with a\r\nheavy hand. As a foretaste of what the champions of innovation might\r\nexpect, much to the disgust of the archbishop, she struck a blow at\r\nthe married clergy by ordering the removal of women and children from\r\nthe enclosures of colleges and cathedrals (1561).\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that it was the opposition of Rome to her accession\r\nthat forced Elizabeth to establish a national church. Paul IV., whose\r\nundiplomatic and imprudent proceedings had caused such grave\r\nembarrassment to her predecessor, made no protest against the\r\nrecognition of Elizabeth's claims, although he was urged to do so by\r\nFrance. The same attitude of friendly reserve was maintained by his\r\nsuccessor Pius IV. (1559-65).[12] Shortly after his consecration he\r\naddressed a kindly letter to Elizabeth exhorting her to return to the\r\nbosom of the Church.[13] His envoy was not allowed, however, to enter\r\nEngland, nor had another envoy, dispatched in 1561 to invite the queen\r\nand the English bishops to take part in the Council of Trent, any\r\nbetter success. Though Elizabeth discussed the matter with the Spanish\r\nambassador and even made preparations for the reception of the papal\r\nenvoy, the necessary safe conducts were not forwarded to Flanders, and\r\nin the end a notification was sent that the papal messenger could not\r\nbe received, nor would the English bishops attend the Council of\r\nTrent. Possibly owing to the friendly attitude of the Pope, rumours\r\nwere put in circulation that he was not unwilling to accept the new\r\nEnglish Book of Common Prayer if Elizabeth would consent to\r\nacknowledge the supremacy of Rome. That there was never the least\r\nfoundation for such a statement is now generally admitted, but at the\r\ntime it helped to confirm many Catholics in the view that to escape\r\nfines and punishment it was lawful for them to attend the English\r\nservice, particularly as they took care to assist at Mass in secret\r\nand made it clear both by their actions and demeanour that their\r\npresence at the new religious rite was not voluntary. Others, however,\r\nrefused to follow this opinion, and in order to put an end to the\r\ndissensions that had arisen a petition was drawn up and forwarded to\r\nthe Pope requesting him for permission to attend Common Prayer, but,\r\nthough the request was supported by the Spanish ambassador, the\r\npermission was refused (1562).\r\n\r\nElizabeth's second Parliament (1563) met at a time when the downfall\r\nof the Huguenots to whom England had furnished assistance, the failure\r\nof a plot entered into by the nephews of Cardinal Pole for the\r\noverthrow of Elizabeth's government, and the reports from the\r\necclesiastical commissioners and the bishops, showing as they did that\r\ncontempt for the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity was still strong,\r\nmade it necessary to undertake more repressive measures against the\r\nCatholics. An Act was passed entitled, \"an Act for the assurance of\r\nthe queen's royal power\" commanding that the oath of supremacy should\r\nbe administered to members of the House of Commons, schoolmasters,\r\ntutors, attorneys, and all who had held any ecclesiastical office\r\nduring the reigns of Elizabeth, Mary, Edward VI. or Henry VIII., and\r\nto all who manifested their hostility to the established religion by\r\ncelebrating Mass or assisting at its celebration. Refusal to take the\r\noath when first tendered was to be punished by forfeiture and life\r\nimprisonment, and on the second refusal the penalty was to be a\r\ntraitor's death. Had such an Act been enforced strictly it would have\r\nmeant the complete extirpation of the Catholics of England, but\r\nElizabeth, having secured a weapon by which she might terrorise them,\r\ntook care to prevent her bishops from driving them to extremes by a\r\nclose investigation of their opinions regarding royal supremacy. Fines\r\nand imprisonment were at this stage deemed more expedient than death.\r\n\r\nConvocation met at the same time, but Convocation had changed much\r\nsince 1559 when it declared bravely in favour of the Real Presence,\r\nTransubstantiation, the Mass, Papal supremacy, and the independence of\r\nthe Church. The effects of the deprivation of the bishops, deans,\r\narchdeacons, canons, and clergy, and of the wholesale ordinations \"of\r\nartificers unlearned and some even of base occupations\" by Parker and\r\nGrindal and others were plainly visible.[14] Convocation was no longer\r\nCatholic in tone. It was distinctly Puritan. A proposal was made that\r\nall holidays and feasts should be abolished except Sundays and \"the\r\nprincipal feasts of Christ,\" that there should be no kneeling at\r\nCommunion, no vestments in the celebration of Common Service except\r\nthe surplice, no organs in the churches, no sign of the cross in\r\nbaptism, and that the minister should be compelled to read divine\r\nservice facing the people. The proposal was debated warmly and in the\r\nend was defeated only by one vote.[15] One of the principal objects\r\nfor which Convocation had been called was to draft a new dogmatic\r\ncreed for the Church \"as by law established.\" This was a matter of\r\nsupreme importance. But as it was necessary to affirm nothing that\r\nwould offend the Huguenots of France and the theologians of\r\nSwitzerland and Germany, or rouse the latent Catholic sentiments of\r\nthe English people, it was also a work of supreme difficulty. In other\r\nwords the creed of the established Church must be in the nature of a\r\ncompromise, and a compromise it really was. The Forty Two Articles of\r\nEdward VI. were taken as the basis of discussion. As a result of the\r\ndeliberations they were reduced to Thirty Nine,[16] in which form they\r\nwere signed by the bishops and clergy, before being presented to\r\nElizabeth and her ministers for approval. As an indication to the\r\nclergy that the office of supreme governor was no sinecure Elizabeth\r\nwould not authorise the publication of the Articles until a very\r\nimportant one dealing with the Eucharist had been omitted, and until\r\nanother one regarding the authority of the Church to change rites and\r\nceremonies had been modified. That influences other than doctrinal\r\nwere at work in shaping the Thirty Nine Articles is evident from the\r\nfact that the particular Eucharistic Article referred to was omitted\r\nin 1563 lest it should drive away Catholics who were wavering, and\r\ninserted again in 1570 when the government, then in open war with\r\nRome, was determined to give back blow for blow. The catechism drawn\r\nup by Convocation for the use of the laity was promptly suppressed by\r\nCecil.\r\n\r\nBy the adoption of the Thirty Nine Articles as its official creed the\r\nEnglish Church \"by law established,\" cut itself adrift from the\r\nCatholic Church and from the faith that had been delivered to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon people by Rome's great missionary St. Augustine. However\r\nambiguous might be the wording to which the authors of the Articles\r\nhad recourse in order to win followers, there could be no longer any\r\ndoubt that on some of the principal points of doctrine the new creed\r\nstood in flagrant contradiction to the doctrines received by the\r\nCatholic world. The Pope, whose spiritual powers had never been called\r\ninto question till the days of Henry VIII., was declared to have no\r\njurisdiction in England. The Sacrifices of the Masses (as it is put)\r\nwere denounced as blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits;\r\nTransubstantiation was regarded as unscriptural and opening the way to\r\nsuperstition; the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence of Christ\r\nwas implicitly condemned; the summoning of a General Council was made\r\ndependent on the will of the secular princes; the fact that such\r\nassemblies could err and did err in the past was emphasised; five of\r\nthe Sacraments, namely, Confirmation, Penance, Holy Orders, Matrimony\r\nand Extreme Unction were declared not to be Sacraments of the Gospel,\r\nand the Roman doctrine concerning Purgatory, Indulgences, the\r\ninvocation of saints, and veneration of images and relics was\r\npronounced to be a foolish and vain invention, contradictory to the\r\nWord of God.[17]\r\n\r\nThe new repressive legislation, at least in regard to fines and\r\nimprisonment, was enforced strictly against Catholics who were still a\r\nstrong body, especially in the north. On the accession of Pius V.\r\n(1566-72) the friendly attitude hitherto maintained by Rome was\r\nchanged. There could no longer be any hope that Elizabeth would modify\r\nher religious policy, as even her former ally and supporter Philip II.\r\nwas forced to admit, and there was grave danger that the opinion\r\nentertained by some, that Catholics should be permitted to attend\r\nCommon Prayer was a purely legal function, might do considerable harm.\r\nHence a strong condemnation of the English service was published by\r\nthe Pope, and a commission was granted to two English priests, Sanders\r\nand Harding, empowering them to absolve all those who had incurred the\r\nguilt of schism (1566). As even this was not sufficient to put an end\r\nto all doubts, and as the authority of the papal agent Laurence Vaux\r\nwas questioned by certain individuals, a formal Bull of reconciliation\r\nwas issued in 1567, authorising the absolution of those who had\r\nincurred the guilt of heresy or schism by their obedience to the Acts\r\nof Supremacy and Uniformity.\r\n\r\nApart from other considerations, this clear and definite statement of\r\nthe attitude of the Pope towards attendance at the English service\r\nhelped to stiffen the backs of the English Catholics, and to determine\r\neven the waverers to stand firm; but in addition to this the question\r\nof the succession to the throne raised considerable discussion.\r\nElizabeth was still without a husband, and for reasons probably best\r\nknown to herself she refused to allow her Parliament to drive her into\r\nmarriage, although partly through vanity, partly through motives of\r\npolicy she was not unwilling to dally with the advances of several\r\nsuitors both native and foreign. In the eyes of Catholics Elizabeth\r\nwas illegitimate, and except for her father's will and the\r\nparliamentary confirmation of that will, as an illegitimate she had no\r\nright to the throne. Mary Queen of Scotland, the grand-daughter of\r\nHenry VIII.'s eldest sister Margaret, was from the legal point of view\r\nthe lawful heir; but as she was the wife of the Dauphin of France at\r\nthe time of Elizabeth's accession, Englishmen generally did not wish\r\nto recognise her claim for precisely the same reasons that drove them\r\nto oppose Queen Mary's marriage with Philip II. of Spain. After the\r\ndeath of her French husband and her return to Scotland opinion began\r\nto change in her favour, and this grew stronger in Catholic circles,\r\nwhen she fled into England to claim the support of her cousin Queen\r\nElizabeth against the Scottish rebels (1568). A strong body even in\r\nthe council favoured the plan of a marriage between Mary and the Duke\r\nof Norfolk, and the recognition of their rights and the rights of\r\ntheir children to the throne on the death of Elizabeth, as the best\r\nmeans of avoiding civil war and of escaping from the delicate position\r\ncreated by the presence of Scotland's Queen in England. Norfolk was\r\nregarded as a kind of Protestant and was backed by a very considerable\r\nbody of the council, but his communications with Philip II. of Spain,\r\nwho favoured the marriage, and with the Catholic lords of the north,\r\nwho, driven to extremes by religious persecution and by the treatment\r\naccorded to Mary in England, were not unwilling to depose Elizabeth,\r\nhe professed his intention of becoming a Catholic. Elizabeth, however,\r\nwas strong against the marriage, and Cecil, though he pretended to\r\nfavour it, supported the views of his sovereign. Rumours of\r\nconspiracies especially in the north were afloat. The noblemen of\r\nLancashire had met and pledged themselves not to attend the English\r\nservice; the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland declared openly\r\ntheir attachment to the Catholic Church; the attitude of Wales and\r\nCornwall was more than doubtful, and the Spanish ambassador was well\r\nknown to be moving heaven and earth to induce his master to lend his\r\naid.[18]\r\n\r\nElizabeth determined to strike at once before the plans of the\r\nconspirators could be matured. The Duke of Norfolk was commanded to\r\nappear at court and was soon lodged safely in the Tower (11th Oct.,\r\n1569). A peremptory order was issued to the Earls of Northumberland\r\nand Westmoreland to come immediately to London, and as they knew well\r\nthe fate that was in store for them they determined to stake their\r\nfortunes on the chance of a successful rising. They appealed to the\r\nCatholic lords of Scotland, to the Duke of Alva, and to Spain for\r\nsupport, and mustered their forces for war. They entered Durham (10th\r\nNov. 1569), where they swept out from the cathedral both the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer and the communion table, set up the altar once more, and\r\nhad Mass celebrated publicly. They marched southwards with the object\r\nof getting possession of the Queen of Scotland who was imprisoned at\r\nTutbury, but their design having been suspected Mary was removed\r\nsuddenly to Coventry. A strong force was sent to prevent their march\r\nsouthward, while Moray, the regent of Scotland and Elizabeth's\r\nfaithful ally, assembled his troops on the border to prevent the\r\nScottish Catholic lords from rallying to the assistance of their\r\nco-religionists. The insurgents, caught between the two fires, were\r\nrouted completely, and the leaders hastened to make their escape.\r\nWestmoreland to the Netherlands, where he lived for thirty years in\r\nexile, and Northumberland to Scotland only to be sold again to\r\nElizabeth for £2,000 and executed. Martial law was proclaimed and\r\nhundreds \"of the poorer sort\" were put to death. The trouble seemed to\r\nbe over for the time, but suddenly in January 1570, encouraged by the\r\nassassination of Moray and by the raids of the Catholic borderers,\r\nLord Dacre rose in revolt, and threw himself upon the queen's forces\r\non their march from Naworth to Carlisle. He was defeated and barely\r\nsucceeded in escaping with his life. All resistance was now at an end,\r\nand more than eight hundred of the insurgents were executed. The\r\nfailure of the Northern Rebellion served only to strengthen\r\nElizabeth's power, and to secure for Protestantism a firm footing in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWhile preparations were being made in England for the rebellion,\r\nCatholic representatives in Rome, both lay and clerical, pressed Pius\r\nV. to issue a decree of excommunication and of deposition against\r\nElizabeth. Such a decree, it was thought, would strengthen the hands\r\nof those who were working in the interests of Mary Queen of Scotland,\r\nand would open the eyes of a large body of Catholics who stood firmly\r\nby Elizabeth solely from motives of extreme loyalty. Philip II. was\r\nnot acquainted with the step that was in contemplation, though\r\napparently the French authorities were warned that Rome was about to\r\ntake action.[19] Had the advice of the King of Spain been sought he\r\nmight have warned the Pope against proceeding to extremes with\r\nElizabeth, and in doing so he would have had the support of those at\r\nhome who were acquainted most intimately with English affairs. In\r\nFebruary (1570) the process against Elizabeth was begun in Rome, and\r\non the 25th of the same month the Bull, /Regnans in Excelsis/,[20]\r\nannouncing the excommunication and deposition of Elizabeth was given\r\nto the world. Had it come five or six months earlier, and had there\r\nbeen an able leader capable of uniting the English Catholic body, a\r\nwork that could not be accomplished either by the Duke of Norfolk or\r\nthe Northern Earls, the result might have been at least doubtful; but\r\nits publication, at a time when the northern rebellion had been\r\nsuppressed, and when Spain, France, and the Netherlands were unwilling\r\nto execute it, served only to make wider the breach between England\r\nand Rome, and to expose the English Catholics to still fiercer\r\npersecution.[21] For so far Catholics had been free to combine with\r\nmoderate Protestants to secure the peaceful succession of Mary Queen\r\nof Scotland without any suspicion of disloyalty to Elizabeth, but from\r\nthis time forward they were placed in the cruel position of being\r\ntraitors either to the Pope or to Elizabeth, and every move made by\r\nthem in favour of Mary Queen of Scotland must necessarily be construed\r\nas disloyalty to their sovereign. Copies of the Bull were smuggled\r\ninto England, and one man, John Fenton, was found brave enough to risk\r\nhis life by affixing a copy to the gates of the palace of the Bishop\r\nof London. He was taken prisoner immediately, and subjected to the\r\nterrible death reserved for traitors (8th August 1570).\r\n\r\nWhile anti-Catholic feeling was running high, Elizabeth summoned\r\nParliament to meet in April 1571. As danger was to be feared both from\r\nthe Catholics and the Puritans special care was taken to ensure that\r\nreliable men should be returned. Several measures were introduced\r\nagainst the Catholic recusants, who had few sympathisers in the House\r\nof Commons, but in the House of Lords, where the Duke of Norfolk, who\r\nhad been released, pleaded for moderation, and was supported by a\r\nsmall but determined body of the Lords, the feeling was less violent.\r\nBills were both framed and passed making it treason to obtain Bulls,\r\nbriefs, or documents from Rome. The penalty of Praemunire was levelled\r\nagainst all aiders and abettors of those offenders mentioned above,\r\ntogether with all who received beads, crosses, pictures, etc., blessed\r\nby the Bishop of Rome, or by any one acting with his authority;[22]\r\nwhile those who had fled from the kingdom were commanded to return\r\nwithin six months under penalty of forfeiture of their goods and\r\nproperty. It was proposed too that all adults should be forced to\r\nattend the Protestant service and to receive Communion at stated\r\ntimes, but the latter portion was dropped probably at the request of\r\nthe Catholic lords. However subservient Parliament might be in regard\r\nto the Catholics it was not inclined to strengthen the hands of the\r\nbishops against the Puritans. Notwithstanding Elizabeth's refusal to\r\nallow discussion of the Thirty Nine Articles, or to permit them to be\r\npublished under parliamentary sanction, the members succeeded in\r\nattaining their object indirectly by imposing them on recusants.\r\nElizabeth was determined, however, to show her faithful Commons that\r\nshe and not the Parliament was the supreme governor of the Church.[23]\r\nShe took Convocation and the bishops under her protection and\r\nempowered them to issue the Articles in a revised form, so that there\r\nwere then really two versions of the Thirty Nine Articles in force,\r\none imposed by Convocation and the queen and the other by Parliament.\r\n\r\nTo secure aid against Spain as well as to draw away the French from\r\nsupporting the Queen of Scotland Elizabeth made overtures for marriage\r\nto the Duke of Anjou, and at the same time the party in favour of Mary\r\ndetermined to make a new effort to bring about a marriage between Mary\r\nand the Duke of Norfolk. Ridolfi[24] was the life and soul of the\r\nconspiracy, assisted by the Duke of Norfolk and by the Bishop of Ross,\r\nMary's ambassador in London. It was hoped to enlist the sympathy of\r\nthe Duke of Alva, Philip II. and the Pope, none of whom were unwilling\r\nto aid in overthrowing Elizabeth's rule, but before anything definite\r\ncould be done Cecil's spies brought him news of the steps that were\r\nbeing taken. The Duke of Norfolk was arrested in September 1571, and\r\nplaced on his trial in the following January. He was condemned to\r\ndeath, but as Elizabeth did not wish to take the responsibility of his\r\nexecution on herself she waited until it had been confirmed by\r\nParliament, after which he was led to the block (2nd June 1572).\r\nParliament also petitioned for the execution of the Queen of Scotland,\r\nbut for various reasons Elizabeth refused to accede to their request.\r\n\r\nThough the new laws were enforced strictly it is clear from the\r\nepiscopal reports that in London itself, in Norwich, Winchester, Ely,\r\nWorcester, in the diocese and province of York, and indeed throughout\r\nthe entire country Catholicism had still a strong hold.[25] The old\r\nMarian priests were, however, dying out rapidly. The monasteries and\r\nuniversities, that had supplied priests for the English mission, were\r\neither destroyed or passed into other hands, so that it became clear\r\nto both friends and foes that unless something could be done to keep\r\nup the supply of clergy the Catholic religion was doomed ultimately to\r\nextinction. This difficulty had occurred to the minds of many of the\r\nEnglish scholars who had fled from Oxford to the Continent, but it was\r\nreserved for Dr. William Allen,[26] formerly a Fellow of Oriel\r\nCollege, and Principal of St. Mary's Hall, Oxford, and later in 1587 a\r\nCardinal of the Roman Church, to take practical measures to meet the\r\nwants of his co-religionists in England. He determined to found a\r\ncollege on the Continent for the education of priests for the English\r\nmission, and as Douay had a new university, in which many of the\r\nformer Oxford men had found a home, he opened a college at Douay in\r\n1568.[27] Depending on his own private resources, the contributions of\r\nhis friends, and the pensions guaranteed by the King of Spain and the\r\nPope, he succeeded beyond expectation. Students flocked from England\r\nto the new college, whence they returned on the completion of their\r\nstudies to strengthen and console their co-religionists at home. Could\r\nDouay College boast only of the 160 martyrs whom it trained and sent\r\ninto England Cardinal Allen would have had good reason to be proud of\r\nhis work, but in addition to this the numerous controversial tracts of\r\nreal merit that were issued from the Douay printing-press, and\r\nscattered throughout England, helped to keep alive Catholic sentiment\r\nin the country. In Douay too was begun the translation of the\r\nScriptures into English, the New Testament being published at Rheims\r\n(1582) whither the college had been removed in 1578, and the old\r\nTestament in 1609. In 1576 Allen visited Rome and persuaded Gregory\r\nXIII. to found a college in Rome for the education of English\r\npriests.[28] Students were sent in 1576 and 1577, and a hospice was\r\ngranted in 1578 as an English seminary, over which the Jesuits were\r\nplaced in the following year. A college was established at Valladolid\r\nby Father Persons (1589), another at Seville in 1592, and one at St.\r\nOmers in 1594.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the northern rebellion, the repressive measures adopted\r\nby Parliament in 1571, and the betrayal of Ridolfi's fantastic\r\nschemes, did not mean the extinction of Catholicism in England. On the\r\ncontrary there was a distinct reaction in its favour, partly through\r\nthe failure of the Protestant bishops and clergy to maintain a\r\nconsistent religious service such as that which they had overthrown,\r\npartly to the revulsion created by the fanatical vapourings of the\r\nPuritans, but above all to the efforts of the \"seminary priests,\" as\r\nthe men who returned from Douay and the other colleges abroad were\r\ncalled. The older generation of clergy who had been deprived on\r\nElizabeth's accession were content to minister to their flocks in\r\nsecret, and were happy so long as they could escape the meshes of the\r\nlaw; but the new men who returned from Douay were determined to make\r\nthe country Catholic once more or to die in the attempt. They went\r\nboldly from place to place exhorting the Catholics to stand firm, and\r\nthey seemed to have no dread of imprisonment, exile or death. Many of\r\nthem were arrested and kept in close confinement, while others, like\r\nThomas Woodhouse (1573), Cuthbert Mayne (1577), John Nelson, and\r\nThomas Sherwood (1578), gloried in being thought worthy of dying as\r\ntheir Master had died.[29]\r\n\r\nNor did their fate deter others from following in their footsteps. It\r\nwas reported in 1579 that a hundred students had been ordained and\r\nsent into England from Rome and Rheims. The result of the labours of\r\nthese apostolic men was soon evident. The government, alarmed at the\r\nsudden resurrection of Popery, urged the bishops and officials to make\r\nnew efforts for its suppression. Throughout the various dioceses\r\ninquiries were begun which served only to show that recusancy was no\r\nlonger confined to Lancashire or the north. The bishops were obliged\r\nto admit (1577) with sorrow that papists \"did increase in numbers and\r\nin obstinacy.\" They recommended the infliction of fines, and furnished\r\nthe authorities with a list of recusants and the value of their\r\nproperty. In York the archbishop reported that \"a more stiff-necked or\r\nwilful people I never knew or heard of, doubtless they are reconciled\r\nwith Rome and sworn to the Pope,\" and what was worse they preferred to\r\nbe imprisoned than to listen to the archbishop's harangues. From\r\nHereford it was announced that \"rebellion is rampant, attendance at\r\nchurch is contemptuous, and John Hareley read so loudly on his latin\r\npopish primer (that he understands not) that he troubles both minister\r\nand people.\" In Oxford and amongst the lawyers in the Inns of Court\r\nand in the Inns of Chancery popery and superstition were still\r\nflourishing.[30]\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse it was soon bruited about that the Jesuits,\r\nwhose very name was sufficient to instil terror, were preparing for an\r\ninvasion of England. The invading force it was true was small, but it\r\nwas select. Persons and Campion,[31] both Oxford men, who having gone\r\ninto exile joined themselves to the Society of St. Ignatius, were\r\nentrusted with the difficult undertaking. The government, warned by\r\nits spies of their mission, had the ports watched to capture them on\r\ntheir arrival, but the two priests contrived to elude the vigilance of\r\ntheir enemies, and succeeded in arriving safely in London (1580). The\r\nnews of their arrival could not be kept a secret, and hence they\r\ndetermined to leave London. Before they separated for the different\r\nfields they had selected, to prevent future misrepresentation of their\r\naims, Campion wrote an open letter addressed to the lords of the privy\r\ncouncil in defence of his views, which letter having been published\r\nwas known as \"Campion's challenge.\" Persons went through the country\r\nfrom Northampton to Gloucester, while Campion preached from Oxford to\r\nNorthampton. They took pains to set up a small printing press, which\r\nwas removed from place to place, and from which was issued sufficient\r\nliterature to disconcert their opponents. Probably the most remarkable\r\nvolume published from the Jesuit printing-press was Campion's /Ten\r\nReasons/,[32] addressed particularly to the Oxford students amongst\r\nwhom it created a great sensation. At last after many hair-breadth\r\nescapes Campion was captured at Lyford and committed to the Tower. He\r\nhad challenged his opponents to meet him in a public disputation, and\r\nnow that he was in their hands, worn out by his labours and\r\nimprisonment, they determined to take up the challenge in the hope\r\nthat by overthrowing him they might shake the faith of his followers.\r\nBut despite his weakness and infirmity they found in him so dangerous\r\nand so learned an adversary that the government thought it wiser to\r\nbring the controversy to an end, or rather to transfer it to the law\r\ncourts. Even here the captive Jesuit showed that he was quite able to\r\nhold his own with the lawyers. He had been guilty of no treason, he\r\naverred; he acknowledged the queen to be his lawful sovereign; but he\r\nrefused to disown the Bull of Deposition. He was found guilty,\r\ncondemned to death as a traitor, and was executed with two other\r\npriests in December 1581.[33]\r\n\r\nDuring the wild start of alarm and vexation caused by the reports of\r\nthe rising strength of the recusants, the invasion of seminary priests\r\nand of Jesuits, and the help given by Gregory XIII. to the Desmond\r\nrebellion, Parliament met (Jan. 1581). An Act was passed immediately\r\nmaking it high treason to possess or to exercise the power of\r\nabsolving or withdrawing anybody from the established church, and a\r\nsimilar penalty was levelled against those who permitted themselves to\r\nbe reconciled or withdrawn, together with all aiders or abettors. The\r\npunishment decreed for celebrating or assisting at Mass was a fine of\r\n100 marks and one year's imprisonment. Fines of £20 per lunar month\r\nwere to be inflicted upon all those who absented themselves from\r\nCommon Prayer, and if their absence lasted for an entire year the\r\ndelinquents should be obliged to provide heavy securities for their\r\ngood behaviour. All schoolmasters or tutors not licensed by the bishop\r\nof the diocese were declared liable to a year's imprisonment, and the\r\nperson who employed them to a fine of not less than £10 per month. The\r\nAct was enforced with merciless severity. Fathers Campion, Sherwin,\r\nand Briant were hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn (Dec. 1581);\r\neleven other priests met a similar fate before the end of the\r\nfollowing year, and two priests and two school-masters were hanged,\r\ndrawn and quartered in 1583.[34] The news of the execution of Campion\r\nand his fellow labourers created a profound impression on the country.\r\nIn reply to the protests that were raised Elizabeth thought at first\r\nof issuing an official statement, but in the end the idea was\r\nabandoned and Cecil, now Lord Burghley, published anonymously two\r\npamphlets to justify the action of the government. The jails were so\r\nfilled with popish recusants that in order to escape the expense of\r\nsupporting them, a plan was formed to convey them to North America,\r\nbut it could not be executed owing to the opposition of the Spanish\r\nGovernment. The seminary priests did not, however, allow themselves to\r\nbe drawn away from their work either by the terrors of treason or by\r\nthe echoes of the wordy war, that was being carried on between Lord\r\nBurghley and his friends on one side, and Dr. Allen and his friends on\r\nthe other. A catechism introduced by them was bought up so rapidly\r\nthat in a few months it was out of print. A great body of the English\r\nnoblemen still held the old faith. In the north Catholics were\r\nnumerous and active, and even in the southern and western counties and\r\nin Wales opinion was veering rapidly towards Rome. Had the seminary\r\npriests been left free to continue their work, unimpeded by foreign or\r\nEnglish political plots on the Continent, it is difficult to say what\r\nmight have been the result. Unfortunately new plots were hatched under\r\nthe protection of France or Spain for the release of Mary Queen of\r\nScotland, and for her proclamation as Queen of England. Throckmorton,\r\nwho had taken the principal part in this affair, was arrested and put\r\nto death; the principal conspirators, men like the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland and the Earl of Arundel were sent to the Tower; the\r\njails were filled with Catholics, and five priests were put to death\r\nat Tyburn (1584).[35]\r\n\r\nParliament met (1585) at a time when the discovery of the plot against\r\nElizabeth and the news of the assassination of William of Orange had\r\ncreated great excitement through the country. An association that had\r\nbeen formed to defend the life of the queen or to revenge her death\r\nwas granted statutory powers by Parliament. The queen was authorised\r\nto create a special commission with authority to deal with all\r\nplotters and to exclude from succession to the throne everyone in\r\nwhose interest she herself might be assassinated. An Act was passed by\r\nwhich all Jesuits and seminary priests were commanded to leave England\r\nwithin forty days under penalty of treason; all persons not in holy\r\norders studying in any foreign seminary or college were ordered to\r\nreturn within six months and to take the oath of supremacy within two\r\ndays of their arrival if they did not wish to be punished as traitors;\r\nall persons harbouring or assisting a priest were to be adjudged\r\nguilty of felony; all who sent their children abroad except by special\r\npermission were to be fined £100 for each offence, and all who had\r\nknowledge of the presence of a priest in England, and who did not\r\nreport it to a magistrate within twelve days were liable to be fined\r\nand imprisoned at the queen's pleasure.[36] This Act was designed to\r\nsecure the banishment or death of all the seminary priests, and if any\r\nof them survived it was due neither to the want of vigilance nor to\r\nthe mildness of the government. Spies were let loose into every part\r\nof England to report the doings of the clergy and laity. Wholesale\r\narrests were effected, and great numbers of the clergy put to death\r\nmerely because they were priests, and of the laymen merely because\r\nthey harboured priests. Three were executed in 1585, thirteen in 1586,\r\nand seven in 1587. To secure the conviction of the prisoners, though\r\nthe law had made the conviction sufficiently certain, but more\r\nespecially to create popular prejudice against them in the minds of\r\nloyal Englishmen, a series of questions were administered to them\r\nknown as the \"bloody\" or \"cut-throat\" questions, as for example,\r\n\"whose part would you take if the Pope or any other by his authority\r\nshould make war on the queen.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThe dismissal of the Spanish ambassador after the discovery of the\r\nThrockmorton plot and the assistance given by England to the rebels in\r\nthe Netherlands helped to increase the hostility between England and\r\nSpain, and to induce Philip II. to make renewed efforts for the\r\noverthrow of Elizabeth's government, while at the same time the\r\nmerciless persecution of the Catholics in England drove many of them\r\nwho wished to remain loyal to co-operate with their brethren abroad\r\nand to assist Philip's schemes. This unfortunate combination of\r\nEnglish Catholics with Spanish politicians did more to mar the work of\r\nthe seminary priests, and to set back the rising Catholic tide than\r\nall that could have been accomplished by Elizabeth's penal laws or\r\nmerciless persecution. The large and increasing body of English people\r\nwho began to look with a friendly eye towards the old faith were\r\nshocked by the adoption of such means, and when they found themselves\r\nface to face with the necessity of selecting between an Anglo-Spanish\r\nparty and Elizabeth, they decided to throw in their lot with the\r\nlatter. The discovery of the Babington plot for the rescue of\r\nScotland's queen led to the death of its author and the execution of\r\nthe lady in whose favour it had been planned (1587). The news of\r\nMary's execution created a great sensation both at home and abroad. To\r\nprevent hostilities on the part of Mary's son, James VI. of Scotland,\r\nor of the Catholic sovereigns on the Continent, Elizabeth, pretending\r\nto be displeased with her ministers for carrying out the sentence,\r\nordered the arrest of Davison the secretary to the council, and had\r\nhim punished by a fine of £10,000 and imprisonment in the Tower.\r\nPhilip II. was not, however, deceived by such conduct, or influenced\r\nby the overtures made for peace. Elizabeth's interference in the\r\naffairs of the Netherlands, the attacks made by her sailors on Spanish\r\nterritories and Spanish treasure-ships, and the execution of Mary\r\nQueen of Scotland determined him to make a final effort for the\r\noverthrow of the English government. The great Armada was got ready\r\nfor the invasion of England (1588). But the Spanish ships were not\r\ndestined to reach the English harbours, nor the Spanish soldiers whom\r\nthey carried on board to test their bravery and skill in conflict with\r\nElizabeth's forces on English soil.\r\n\r\nThough there is no evidence either from English or Spanish reports\r\nthat Catholics in England welcomed the Armada, since both Lord\r\nBurghley[38] and Philip II. were convinced that Spain could not rely\r\non their co-operation, and though in many parts of the country\r\nCatholics volunteered for service to fight the invader, the government\r\ndetermined to wreak its vengeance on the helpless victims in prison.\r\nWithin three days six priests and eight laymen were executed near\r\nLondon (August); nine priests and three laymen were put to death in\r\nOctober, and before the end of the year thirty-one had suffered the\r\nterrible punishment reserved for traitors, merely because they refused\r\nto conform. The prisons were so full of recusants that new houses were\r\nopened for their detention. The government reaped a rich harvest by\r\nthe heavy fines inflicted on the wealthy Catholics and took pains,\r\nbesides, to annoy them at every turn by domiciliary visits in search\r\nof concealed priests. Yet the reports from the country, especially\r\nfrom such places as Lancashire and Cheshire, showed that the Papists\r\nwere still dangerously strong. A new proclamation was issued against\r\nseminary priests and Jesuits (1591). Nine priests and two laymen had\r\nbeen put to death in the previous year (1590), and in 1591 fifteen\r\nwere martyred, seven of whom were priests and the rest laymen.\r\nThroughout the remainder of Queen Elizabeth's reign Catholics in\r\nEngland were not allowed to enjoy peace or respite. If priests, they\r\nwere by that very fact liable to be hunted down and condemned as\r\ntraitors; if they were laymen of substance, they were beggared by\r\nheavy fines imposed for non-attendance at the English service, or\r\npunished by imprisonment, and if they were too poor to pay a fine they\r\ncould be driven from the kingdom for refusing to conform. Apart\r\naltogether from the immense sums levied on Catholics by fines and\r\nforfeitures, and from the number of people who died in prison either\r\nfrom confinement or torture, one hundred and eighty-nine were put to\r\ndeath for the faith under Elizabeth, one hundred and twenty-eight of\r\nwhom were priests; and yet, notwithstanding this persecution,\r\nCatholics were still comparatively strong at the death of Elizabeth,\r\nand the supply of clergy showed no signs of being exhausted. Over\r\nthree hundred and sixty priests were in England attending to the wants\r\nof their co-religionists in 1603.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the dissensions among the Catholic party in England and\r\non the Continent did more harm to their cause than Elizabeth's\r\npersecutions. The close co-operation of Allen and Persons with Spanish\r\npolitical designs for the overthrow of Elizabeth and the invasion of\r\nEngland was as distasteful to a large body of the lay Catholics in\r\nEngland as it was to many of the clergy.[39] Though serious disputes\r\nhad broken out long before, it was only after the death of Cardinal\r\nAllen in 1594 that the crisis reached a head. Many of the secular\r\nclergy objected warmly to the influence of the Jesuits, and ugly\r\ncontroversies broke out in England and in the English colleges abroad.\r\nPersons and his friends were supposed to be plotting in favour of the\r\nsuccession of a Catholic to the throne on the death of Elizabeth,\r\nwhile most of their opponents favoured the succession of James VI. of\r\nScotland, from whom they expected at least toleration. To put an end\r\nto what the latter regarded as the excessive authority of the Jesuits\r\nthey insisted on the appointment of a bishop who would take charge of\r\nEnglish affairs, but for various reasons the Holy See refused to yield\r\nto their request. As a compromise, however, George Blackwell was\r\nappointed archpriest (1598) with secret instructions, it was said, to\r\nconsult Garnet, the Jesuit superior in England. The selection was\r\nsingularly unfortunate, as neither from the point of view of prudence\r\nnor of reliability was Blackwell fitted for the extremely delicate\r\nposition which he was called upon to fill. The seculars refused at\r\nfirst to obey his authority and appealed again to the Pope, who\r\nconfirmed the appointment. As many of the seculars were still\r\nunwilling to yield some of the leaders were censured by the\r\narchpriest. A new appeal was forwarded to Rome. In 1602 Clement VIII.\r\nissued a document upholding the authority of the archpriest, and,\r\nwhile firmly defending the Jesuits against the charges that had been\r\nmade against them, warned Blackwell that he should not take his\r\ninstructions from any person except from the Pope or the Cardinal\r\nProtector of England.[40] This controversy could not be kept a secret.\r\nIt was known to the entire Catholic body, and it was used with great\r\nforce and success by their opponents. The government took sides with\r\nthe secular clergy and offered them facilities for carrying their\r\nappeals to Rome, but news of the secret negotiations between the\r\nseculars and the authorities having been divulged Elizabeth issued a\r\nnew proclamation (1602) in which she announced that she had never any\r\nintention of tolerating two religions in England.[41] The Jesuits and\r\ntheir adherents were commanded to quit the kingdom within thirty days,\r\nand their opponents within three months under penalty of treason. To\r\ngive effect to this proclamation a new commission with extraordinary\r\npowers was appointed to secure the banishment of the Catholic clergy.\r\nThe seculars, who had opposed the archpriest, encouraged by the\r\ndistinction drawn in the proclamation between the two classes of\r\nEnglish priests, the loyal and the disloyal, determined to draw up an\r\naddress to the queen proclaiming their civil allegiance,[42] but\r\nbefore it was considered Elizabeth had passed away, and the fate in\r\nstore for them was to be determined by a new ruler.\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] Cf.

(1603-25) Catholics expected if not a\r\nrepeal at least a suspension of the penal laws. As a son of Mary Queen\r\nof Scots for whose rescue Catholics in England and on the Continent\r\nhad risked so much, and as one whose religious views were thought to\r\napproximate more closely to Catholicism than to Nonconformity, it was\r\nhoped that he would put an end to the persecution that had been\r\ncarried on so bitterly during the reign of his predecessor. But\r\nwhatever might be the sentiments he entertained secretly or gave\r\nexpression to while he was yet only King of Scotland, his opinions\r\nunderwent a sudden change when he saw an opportunity of strengthening\r\nhis hold upon the English people, and of providing for the penniless\r\nfollowers who accompanied him to his new kingdom. Unfortunately a\r\nbrainless plot, the \"Bye Plot,\" as it is called, organised to capture\r\nthe king and to force him to yield to the demands of the conspirators,\r\nafforded the more bigoted officials a splendid chance of inducing\r\nJames to continue the former policy of repression. Two priests named\r\nWatson and Clarke joined hands with a number of malcontents, some of\r\nwhom were Protestants, others Puritans anxious to secure more liberty\r\nfor their co-religionists; but news of the plot having come to the\r\nears of the archpriest and of Garnet the provincial of the Jesuits,\r\ninformation was conveyed to the council, and measures were taken for\r\nthe safety of the king, and for the arrest of the conspirators. James\r\nrecognised fully that the Catholic body was not to blame for the\r\nviolent undertakings of individuals, especially as he knew or was soon\r\nto know that the Pope had warned the archpriest and the Jesuits to\r\ndiscourage attempts against the government, and had offered to\r\nwithdraw any clergyman from England who might be regarded as disloyal.\r\nJames admitted frankly his indebtedness to the Catholics for the\r\ndiscovery of the plot, and promised a deputation of laymen who waited\r\non him that the fines imposed on those who refused to attend the\r\nProtestant service should not be exacted. For a time it was expected\r\nthat the policy of toleration was about to win the day, and the hopes\r\nof Catholics rose high; but in autumn (1603) when the episcopal\r\nreturns came in showing that Catholics were still strong, and when\r\nalarming reports began to spread about the arrival of additional\r\npriests, the wonderful success of their efforts, and the increasing\r\nboldness of the recusants, an outcry was raised by the Protestant\r\nparty, and a demand was made that the government should enforce the\r\nlaw with firmness.[1]\r\n\r\nShortly before the meeting of Parliament in March (1604) James\r\ndetermined to show the country that his attitude towards Catholicism\r\nwas in no wise different from that of his predecessor. In a\r\nproclamation (Feb. 1604) he deplored the increasing number and\r\nactivity of priests and Jesuits, denounced their efforts to win\r\nrecruits for Rome, declared that he had never intended to grant\r\ntoleration, and ended up by commanding all Jesuits and seminary\r\npriests to depart from the kingdom before the 19th March, unless they\r\nwished to incur the penalties that had been levelled against them in\r\nthe previous reign.[2] In his speech at the opening of Parliament\r\n(March 1604) after announcing his adhesion to the religion \"by law\r\nestablished\" he outlined at length his attitude towards Rome. \"I\r\nacknowledge\" he said \"the Roman Church to be our mother church\r\nalthough defiled with some infirmities and corruptions as the Jews\r\nwere when they crucified Christ;\" for the \"quiet and well-minded\"\r\nlaymen who had been brought up in the Catholic faith he entertained\r\nfeelings of pity rather than of anger, but in case of those who had\r\n\"changed their coats\" or were \"factious stirrers of sedition\" he was\r\ndetermined if necessary to take measures whereby their obstinacy might\r\nbe corrected. The clergy, however, stood on a different footing. So\r\nlong as they maintained \"that arrogant and impossible supremacy of\r\ntheir head the Pope, whereby he not only claims to be the spiritual\r\nhead of all Christians, but also to have an imperial civil power over\r\nall kings and emperors, dethroning and decrowning princes with his\r\nfoot as pleaseth him, and dispensing and disposing of all kingdoms and\r\nempires at his appetite,\" and so long as the clergy showed by their\r\npractices that they considered it meritorious rather than sinful to\r\nrebel against or to assassinate their lawful sovereign if he be\r\nexcommunicated by the Pope, they need expect no toleration.[3]\r\nParliament soon showed that it was guided by the old Elizabethan\r\nspirit. An Act was passed ordering that the laws framed during the\r\nlate reign against Jesuits, seminary priests, and recusants should be\r\nrigidly enforced; all persons studying in foreign colleges who did not\r\nreturn and conform within one year, as well as all students who should\r\ngo abroad for instruction in future should be declared incapable of\r\ninheriting, purchasing, or enjoying any lands, chattels, or annuities\r\nin England; all owners or masters of vessels who should convey such\r\npassengers from the country were to be punished by confiscation of\r\ntheir vessel and imprisonment, and if any person should dare to act as\r\ntutor in a Catholic family without having got a licence from the\r\nbishop of the diocese, both the teacher and his employer should be\r\nfined £2 for every day he violated the law.[4] Lord Montague, having\r\nventured to speak his mind openly in the House of Lords against such a\r\nmeasure, was arrested for his \"scandalous and offensive speech,\" and\r\nwas committed to the Fleet. The old penal laws and the new ones were\r\nenforced with unusual severity. Courts were everywhere at work drawing\r\nup lists of recusants and assessing fines. Never before, even in the\r\nworst days of Elizabeth, were the wealthy Catholics called upon to pay\r\nso much. Numbers of priests were seized and conveyed to the coasts for\r\nbanishment abroad; one priest was put to death simply because he was a\r\npriest, and two laymen underwent a like punishment because they had\r\nharboured or assisted priests.\r\n\r\nEnglish Catholics were incensed at such pitiless persecution. Had it\r\nbeen inflicted by Elizabeth from whom they expected no mercy, it would\r\nhave been cruel enough; but coming from a king, to whom they had good\r\nreason to look for toleration, and who before he left Scotland and\r\nafter his arrival in London had promised an improvement of their\r\ncondition, it was calculated to stir up very bitter feeling. Forgetful\r\nof the warnings of the Pope conveyed to the archpriest and the\r\nsuperior of the Jesuits, some of the more extreme men undertook a new\r\nplot against the king. The leading spirit in the enterprise was Robert\r\nCatesby, a gentleman of Warwickshire, whose father had suffered for\r\nhis adhesion to the old faith. He planned to blow up the Parliament\r\nHouse at the opening of the session of Parliament when king, lords,\r\nand commons would be assembled. Hence his plot is known as the\r\nGunpowder Plot. His followers had to be ready to rise when the results\r\nof this awful crime would have thrown the government into confusion.\r\nThey were to seize the children of the king and to assume control of\r\nthe kingdom. The scheme was so utterly wicked and impracticable, that\r\nit is difficult to understand how any man could have conceived it or\r\ninduced others to join in its execution. Unfortunately, however,\r\nCatesby secured the assistance of Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, an\r\nEnglishman who had served in the Spanish army, John Wright, Thomas\r\nPercy, cousin of the Earl of Northumberland, Sir Everard Digby, and\r\nFrancis Tresham. A mine was to be run under the House of Commons\r\ncharged with gunpowder, which Fawkes undertook to explode. An\r\nadjoining house was secured, and the cellar stretching under the\r\nParliament buildings was leased. Everything was arranged for the\r\ndestruction of the king, lords and commons at the opening of\r\nParliament fixed finally for the 5th November 1605, but Tresham,\r\nanxious to save his brother-in-law, Lord Monteagle, sent him a letter\r\nwarning him to absent himself on the occasion. By means of this letter\r\nthe plot was discovered, and Guy Fawkes was arrested. The other\r\nconspirators fled to Wales, where they hoped to stir up an\r\ninsurrection, but at Holbeche where they halted they were surrounded\r\nby the forces of the sheriff of Worcester. In the struggle that ensued\r\nCatesby and several of his followers, who defended themselves with\r\ndesperate courage, were killed, and the remainder were put to death\r\nbefore the end of the month (Nov. 1605).\r\n\r\nWhether the plot had not its origin in the minds of some of the\r\nministers, who in their desire for the wholesale destruction of\r\nCatholics had employed agents to spur on Catesby and his companions,\r\nor, at least had allowed them to continue their operations long after\r\nthe designs had been reported it is difficult to determine; but\r\nimmediately an outcry was raised that the plot had been organised by\r\nthe Jesuits Garnet, Gerard, and Greenway, for whose arrest a\r\nproclamation was issued. Garnet had undoubtedly done much to persuade\r\nCatesby from having recourse to outrage or violence, and had never\r\nbeen consulted except in such a vague way that he could not possibly\r\nhave suspected what was in contemplation. He had even secured from\r\nRome a condemnation of violent measures, and had communicated this to\r\nCatesby. Greenway was consulted after the plot had been arranged, but\r\napparently under the seal of confession with permission, however, to\r\nreveal it to none but Garnet, and according to Greenway's own\r\nstatement he had done his best to persuade Catesby to abandon his\r\ndesign. Garnet was then consulted by his Jesuit companion, from whom\r\nhe obtained permission to speak about the secret in case of grave\r\nnecessity and after it had become public. When Garnet and Oldcorn had\r\nbeen arrested they were permitted to hold a conversation with spies\r\nplaced in such a position that all they said could be overheard.\r\nGarnet, when informed of this, told his story plainly and frankly. He\r\nwas condemned and put to death, as was also Father Oldcorn. There is\r\nno evidence to show that the Jesuits urged on the conspirators to\r\ncommit such a crime. On the contrary, both from the statements of the\r\nconspirators and of the Jesuits, it is perfectly clear that the\r\nJesuits had used every effort to persuade the plotters to abandon\r\ntheir design, and the worst that could be said of Garnet is that he\r\nfailed to take the steps he should have taken when he found that his\r\nadvice had fallen on deaf ears.[5]\r\n\r\nThough Blackwell, the official head of the Catholic body in England,\r\nhastened to issue a letter urging his co-religionists to abstain from\r\nall attempts against the government (7th Nov. 1605), Parliament,\r\nwithout attempting to distinguish between the innocent and the guilty,\r\ndetermined to punish Catholics generally. Recusants who had conformed\r\nwere commanded to receive the Sacrament at least once a year under\r\npenalty of a heavy fine. In place of the £20 per month levied off\r\nthose Catholics who refused to attend Protestant service, the king was\r\nempowered to seize two-thirds of their estates. Catholics were\r\nforbidden to attend at court, to remain in London or within ten miles\r\nof London unless they practised some trade and had no residence\r\nelsewhere, or to move more than five miles from their homes unless\r\nthey got the permission of two magistrates, confirmed by the bishop or\r\ndeputy-lieutenant of the county. They could not practise as lawyers or\r\ndoctors, hold any commissions in the army or navy, act as executors,\r\nguardians, or administrators, appoint to benefices or schools, or\r\nappear as suitors before the courts. Fines of £10 per month were to be\r\npaid by anyone who harboured a servant or visitor who did not attend\r\nthe English service. In order to test the loyalty of his Majesty's\r\nsubjects it was enacted that a bishop or two justices of the peace\r\nmight summon any person who was suspected of recusancy, and require\r\nhim to take a special oath of loyalty embodied in the Act. If any\r\npersons not of noble birth refused to take the oath they should be\r\ncommitted to prison till the next quarter sessions or assizes, and if\r\nin these assemblies they persisted in their refusal they incurred\r\nthereby the penalty of Praemunire.[6]\r\n\r\nBoth in its substance and particularly in its form the oath of\r\nallegiance was objectionable, and whether or not it was designed with\r\nthe intention of dividing the Catholic body, it succeeded in producing\r\nthat effect. Many Catholics thought that, as they were called upon to\r\nrenounce merely the authority of the Pope to depose princes or to make\r\nwar on them, they could take it as a sign of civil allegiance without\r\nabandoning their obedience to the Pope as their spiritual superior.\r\nOthers thought differently, however, and as a consequence a violent\r\ncontroversy broke out which disturbed the England Catholics for close\r\non a century. The archpriest Blackwell condemned the oath at first,\r\nbut in a conference with the clergy held in July 1606 he declared in\r\nits favour. Acting on this opinion the lay peers and many of the\r\nclergy consented to take the oath. The other side appealed to Rome for\r\na decision, and a brief was issued on the 22nd September 1606, by\r\nwhich the oath was condemned as unlawful. Blackwell neglected to\r\npublish the brief probably from motives of prudence, though other\r\ngrounds were alleged, and in the following year a new condemnation was\r\nforwarded from Rome (Aug. 1607). Meanwhile Blackwell had taken the\r\noath himself, and had published letters permitting Catholics to act\r\nsimilarly. As he was unwilling to recede from his position\r\nnotwithstanding the appeals of Father Persons and Cardinal Bellarmine,\r\nhe was deposed from his office and George Birkhead or Birket was\r\nappointed archpriest (1608). The controversy now became general. James\r\nI. entered the lists with a book entitled /Apologie for the Oath of\r\nAllegiance/, in which he sought to meet the reasons contained in the\r\npapal documents and in the letters of Father Persons and Cardinal\r\nBellarmine. Both writers replied to the royal challenge, and soon\r\nhosts of others, both Catholic and Protestant hastened to take part in\r\na wordy war, the only result of which was to disedify the faithful, to\r\nturn away waverers from the Church, and to cause rejoicings to the\r\nenemies of the Catholic cause. Birkhead, who had been empowered to\r\nsuspend all priests who did not show some signs of repentance for\r\nhaving taken the oath, acted with great moderation in the hope of\r\navoiding a schism, but at last he was obliged to make use of the\r\npowers with which he was entrusted (1611).[7]\r\n\r\nThe old controversies between the Jesuits and a large section of the\r\nseminary priests were renewed both at home and on the Continent. The\r\nseculars objecting to the control exercised by the Jesuits in England,\r\nin regard to English affairs at Rome, and in the foreign colleges,\r\ncontinued to petition for the appointment of a bishop. Ugly disputes\r\nensued and many things were done by both sides during the heat of the\r\nstrife that could not be defended. The Holy See found it difficult to\r\ndecide between the various plans put forward, but at last in 1623 Dr.\r\nBishop was appointed Bishop of Calcedon /in partibus infidelium/, and\r\nentrusted with the government of the English mission. During these\r\nyears of strife one important work, destined to have a great effect on\r\nthe future of Catholicism in England, was accomplished, namely the\r\nre-establishment of the English congregation of the Benedictines. The\r\nBenedictine community had been re-established at Westminster in 1556\r\nwith the Abbot Feckenham as superior, but they were expelled three\r\nyears later. Of the monks who had belonged to this community only one,\r\nDom Buckley, was alive in 1607. Before his death he affiliated two\r\nEnglish Benedictines belonging to an Italian house to the English\r\ncongregation, and in 1619 the English Benedictines on the Continent\r\nwere united with the English congregation by papal authority.[8] The\r\nhouses of the English Benedictines on the Continent were situated at\r\nDouay (1605), at Dieulouard (1606), at Paris (1611), Saint-Malo (1611)\r\nand Lambspring in Germany (1643). The members bound themselves by oath\r\nto labour for the re-conversion of their country, and the list of\r\nBenedictine martyrs who died for the faith in England bears testimony\r\nto the fact that their oath was faithfully observed.\r\n\r\nWhile these unfortunate controversies were weakening and disheartening\r\nthe Catholics the penal laws were enforced with great severity. One\r\nmartyr suffered in 1607, three in 1608, five in 1610, two in 1616, and\r\nfive in 1618. Great numbers of priests were confined in prison or\r\ntransported abroad. Laymen were ruined by imprisonment, and especially\r\nby the high fines required by the king to meet his own expenses.\r\nAccording to his own statement he received from the fines of Popish\r\nrecusants a net income of £36,000 a year. Parliament and the\r\nProtestant party generally were anxious about the marriage of Prince\r\nCharles, the heir to the throne, and of the princess Elizabeth his\r\nsister. If they were married into Protestant families the religious\r\ndifficulty, it was thought, might disappear; but, if, on the contrary,\r\nthey were united to the royal houses of France or Spain the old battle\r\nmight be renewed. Hence the marriage of Elizabeth to the Elector\r\nFrederick of the Palatinate, one of the foremost champions of\r\nProtestantism in Germany, gave great satisfaction at the time, though\r\nlater on it led to serious trouble between the king and Parliament,\r\nwhen Elizabeth's husband was driven from his kingdom during the Thirty\r\nYears' War.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the wishes of his Parliament the king was anxious to\r\nprocure for Prince Charles the hand of the Infanta Maria, second\r\ndaughter of Philip III. of Spain. To prepare the way for such a step\r\nboth in Spain and at Rome, where it might be necessary to sue for a\r\ndispensation, something must be done to render less odious the working\r\nof the penal laws. Once news began to leak out of the intended\r\nmarriage with Spain and of the possibility of toleration for Catholics\r\nParliament petitioned (1620) the king to break off friendly relations\r\nwith Spain, to throw himself into the war in Germany on the side of\r\nhis son-in-law, and to enforce strictly all the laws against\r\nrecusants. But the king refused to accept the advice of his Parliament\r\nor to allow it to interfere in what, he considered, were his own\r\nprivate affairs. The marriage arrangements were pushed forward, and at\r\nthe same time care was taken to inform the magistrates and judges that\r\nthe laws against Catholics should be interpreted leniently. In a few\r\nweeks, it is said that about four thousand prisoners were set at\r\nliberty. The articles of marriage were arranged satisfactorily (1623),\r\ndue provision being made for the religious freedom of the Infanta, and\r\na guarantee being given that the religious persecution should cease,\r\nbut for various reasons the marriage never took place. Parliament\r\npromised the king to provide the funds necessary for war if only he\r\nwould end the negotiations for a Spanish alliance, and this time James\r\nmuch against his will followed the advice of his Parliament (1624). A\r\nnew petition was presented for the strict enforcement of the penal\r\nlaws against priests and recusants, to which petition the king was\r\nobliged to yield. But hardly had the negotiations with Spain ended\r\nthan proposals were made to France for a marriage between the prince\r\nand Henrietta Maria, sister of Louis XIII., and once more it was\r\nnecessary to be careful about offending Catholic feeling. By a secret\r\narticle of the agreement with France James promised to grant even\r\ngreater freedom to Catholics than had been promised them in his\r\ndealings with the Spanish court, and as a pledge of his good faith he\r\nreleased many prisoners who had been convicted on account of their\r\nreligion, returned some of the fines that had been levied, and gave a\r\nhint to those charged with the administration of the law that the\r\npenal enactments should not be enforced. Application was made to Rome\r\nfor a dispensation, which though granted, was to be delivered by the\r\npapal nuncio at Paris only on condition that James signed a more\r\nexplicit statement of his future policy towards his Catholic subjects.\r\nLouis XIII., annoyed by the delays interposed by the Roman court, was\r\nnot unwilling to proceed with the marriage without the dispensation,\r\nbut for obvious reasons James refused to agree to such a course.\r\nFinally all difficulties were surmounted, though not before James had\r\npassed away leaving it to his son and successor to ratify the\r\nagreement. In May 1625, Charles was married by proxy to Henrietta\r\nMaria, and in the following month the new queen arrived in London.[9]\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of the reign of James I. the foreign policy of\r\nthe king rendered a relaxation of the penal code absolutely necessary.\r\nIn the course of the marriage negotiations with France James I. had\r\npledged himself by a secret agreement to adopt a policy of toleration,\r\nand on his death the agreement was ratified more than once by his son\r\nand successor Charles I. (1625-1649). But Charles, though personally\r\nwell disposed towards the Catholics, was not a man to consider himself\r\nbound by any obligations if the fulfilment of them should involve him\r\nin serious difficulties. At the time of his accession public opinion\r\nin England as reflected by Parliament was intensely hostile to\r\ntoleration. On the one hand the Puritan party, who had grown\r\nconsiderably despite the repressive measures of Elizabeth and James\r\nI., was determined to bring the Church into line with Calvinism, while\r\non the other hand a body of able and learned men within the Anglican\r\nChurch itself longed for a closer approximation towards Catholic\r\nbeliefs and practices. With both the Bible was still in a sense the\r\nsole rule of faith, but the Puritan party would have the Bible and\r\nnothing but the Bible, while the High Church men insisted that the\r\nScriptures must be interpreted in the light of the traditional usages\r\nof the Christian world, and that in matters of doctrine and practices\r\nsome jurisdiction must be conceded to the teaching authorities of the\r\nChurch. The opponents of the latter stirred the people against them by\r\nraising the cry of Arminianism and Papistry, and by representing them\r\nas abettors of Rome and as hostile to the religious settlement that\r\nhad been accomplished. As a result of this controversy, in which the\r\nking sided with Laud and the High Church party against the\r\nPresbyterians and Calvinists,[10] Parliament, which supported the\r\nPuritans, clamoured incessantly for the execution of the penal laws.\r\n\r\nIn the first Parliament, opened the day after Queen Henrietta's\r\narrival in England (1625) a petition was presented to the king praying\r\nfor the strict enforcement of the penal laws. Yielding to this\r\npetition Charles issued a proclamation ordering the bishops and\r\nofficials to see that the laws were put into execution, but at the\r\nsame time he took care to let it be known that the extraction of fines\r\nfrom the wealthy laymen and the imprisonment or transportation of\r\npriests would be more agreeable to him than the infliction of the\r\ndeath penalty. Louis XIII. and the Pope protested warmly against this\r\nbreach of a solemn agreement. Charles replied that he had bound\r\nhimself not to enforce the penal laws merely as a means of lulling the\r\nsuspicions of Rome and of securing a dispensation for his\r\nmarriage.[11] Still, though the queen's French household was\r\ndismissed, the king did everything he could to prevent the shedding of\r\nblood. The Parliamentarians, who were fighting for civil liberty for\r\nthemselves, were annoyed that any measure of liberty should be\r\nconceded to their Catholic fellow-countrymen. They presented a\r\npetition to Charles at the very time they were safeguarding their own\r\nposition by the Petition of Rights (1628) demanding that priests who\r\nreturned to England should be put to death, and that the children of\r\nCatholic parents should be taken from their natural guardians and\r\nreared in the Protestant religion.[12] Charles defended his own policy\r\nof toleration on the ground that it was calculated to secure better\r\ntreatment for Protestant minorities in other countries, yet at the\r\nsame time he so far abandoned his policy of not shedding blood as to\r\nallow the death penalty to be inflicted on a Jesuit and a layman\r\n(1628).[13] So long however as he could secure money from the\r\nCatholics he was not particularly anxious about their religious\r\nopinions. Instead of the fines to which they had been accustomed, he\r\ncompounded with them by agreeing not to enforce their presence at the\r\nProtestant service on condition that they paid an annual sum to be\r\nfixed by his commissioners according to the means of the individual\r\nrecusants.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a bishop to take charge of the English Mission\r\n(1623) did not unfortunately put an end to the regrettable\r\ncontroversies that divided the Catholic party. On the death of Dr.\r\nBishop, Dr. Richard Smith was appointed to succeed him (1625), and was\r\nconsecrated in France. For a time after his arrival affairs moved\r\nsmoothly enough, but soon a more violent controversy broke out\r\nregarding the respective rights and privileges of seculars and\r\nregulars, and the obligation on confessors of obtaining episcopal\r\napprobation. The dispute became public, and in a short time numerous\r\npamphlets were published in England and in France by the literary\r\nchampions of both parties. As the Puritans resented strongly the\r\npresence of a bishop in England, Dr. Smith was obliged to go into\r\nhiding, and ultimately made his escape to France, where he died in\r\n1665. The Pope found it difficult to apportion the blame or to put an\r\nend to the strife, but an opportunity was afforded him of learning the\r\nfacts of the case when an English agent deputed by the queen arrived\r\nin Rome (1633). In return Urban VIII. determined to send an envoy into\r\nEngland mainly to settle the controversy between the regulars and the\r\nseculars, but also to discover the real sentiments of the court and\r\nthe country towards Rome. The person selected for this difficult work\r\nwas Gregory Panzani,[14] an Oratorian, who arrived in England in 1634\r\nand had several interviews with the king and queen. Whatever might\r\nhave been the hopes of inducing Laud and some of the leading bishops\r\nto consider the question of returning to the Roman allegiance, the\r\nmain object the king had in view in permitting the residence of a\r\npapal envoy in London and in sending English agents to Rome was to\r\nsecure the help of Urban VIII. for his nephew of the Palatinate, and\r\nespecially to induce the Pope to favour a marriage between this nephew\r\nand the daughter of the King of Poland. Very little was obtained on\r\neither side by these negotiations, nor did the papal agents in England\r\nsucceed in composing the differences between the clergy.\r\n\r\nIn 1640 Laud published the canons framed by Convocation for the\r\ngovernment of the English Church. With the object of clearing himself\r\nof the charge of Papistry he ordered a new persecution to be begun,\r\nbut the king intervened to prevent the execution of this measure. At a\r\ntime when Charles was receiving large sums of money by way of\r\ncompensation for non-attendance at the Protestant services, and when\r\nhe foresaw that in the conflict that was to come he could rely on the\r\nCatholic noblemen to stand loyally by him, he had no wish to\r\nexasperate the Catholics in England, or to outrage Catholic feeling in\r\nFrance and at Rome. In 1640, however, Parliament returned to the\r\ncharge. The presence of papal agents in England, the payment of\r\n£10,000 by the Catholic noblemen to help the king in his expedition\r\nagainst the Scots, and the enrolment of a Catholic army in Ireland by\r\nStrafford, were urged as arguments to prove that the king's failure to\r\ncarry out the laws against Catholics was due to causes other than had\r\nbeen alleged. Indeed both before and after the outbreak of the Civil\r\nWar (1642) the king's cause was damaged badly by his secret alliance\r\nwith Rome. As a matter of fact the Catholics did rally to the standard\r\nof the king, but the persecution to which they had been subjected\r\nwherever the Parliament had control made it impossible for them to act\r\ndifferently. During the years that elapsed between 1642 and 1651,\r\ntwenty-one victims, including priests, both secular and regular, and\r\nlaymen, were put to death for their religion.[15] When at last\r\nParliament had triumphed a new persecution was begun. An Act was\r\npassed in 1650 offering for the apprehension of priests rewards\r\nsimilar to those paid for securing the arrest of highway robbers.\r\nInformers and spies were set at work, and as a result of their labours\r\nmany priests were captured and confined in prison or transported. Yet,\r\nthough the opponents of the king made it one of their main charges\r\nagainst him that he refused to shed the blood of the clergy, they\r\nadopted a similar policy when they themselves were in power. During\r\nthe whole Protectorate of Cromwell only one priest was put to death in\r\nEngland. But recourse was had to other methods for the extirpation of\r\nthe Catholic religion, imprisonment, transportation, and above all\r\nheavy fines exacted off those Catholics who held property in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFrom Charles II. (1660-1685) Catholics had some reason to expect an\r\namelioration of their sad condition. They had fought loyally for his\r\nfather and had suffered for their loyalty even more than the\r\nProtestant loyalists. In the hour of defeat they had shielded the life\r\nof the young prince, and had aided him in escaping from enemies who\r\nwould have dealt with him as they had dealt with the king. Mindful of\r\ntheir services and of promises Charles had made in exile, and well\r\naware that he had inherited from his mother, Queen Henrietta, a strong\r\nleaning towards the Catholic Church, they hoped to profit by the\r\nDeclaration of Breda, which promised liberty of conscience to all his\r\nsubjects. But Charles, though secretly in favour of the Catholics on\r\naccount of their loyalty to his father and to himself, was not a man\r\nto endanger his throne for the sake of past services, more especially\r\nas his trusted minister, the Earl of Clarendon, was determined to\r\nsuppress Dissenters no matter what creed they might profess. A number\r\nof Catholics, lay and cleric, met at Arundel House to prepare a\r\npetition to the House of Lords (1661) for the relaxation of the Penal\r\nLaws. The petition was received favourably, and as there was nobody in\r\nthe House of Lords willing to defend the infliction of the death\r\npenalty on account of religion, it was thought that the laws whereby\r\nit was considered treason to be a priest or to shelter a priest might\r\nbe abolished. But dissensions soon arose, even in the Catholic\r\ncommittee itself. The kind of oath of allegiance that might be taken,\r\nthe extension of the proposed relaxations so as to include the\r\nJesuits, and the anxiety of the laymen to get rid of the fines levied\r\non rich recusants rather than of the penalties meted out to the\r\nclergy, led to the dissolution of the committee, and to the\r\nabandonment of their suggested measures of redress.[16]\r\n\r\nClarendon was determined to crush the Nonconformist party\r\nnotwithstanding the promises that had been held out to them in the\r\nDeclaration of Breda. He secured the enactment of a number of laws,\r\nthe Act of Uniformity (1662), the Conventicle Act (1664) and the Five\r\nMile Act (1665) known as the Clarendon Code, which, though directed\r\nprincipally against the Dissenters, helped to increase the hardships\r\nof the Catholic body. Once, indeed, in 1662-63, Charles made a feeble\r\nattempt to redeem his promise to both Catholics and Nonconformists by\r\nannouncing his intention of applying to Parliament to allow him to\r\nexercise the dispensing power in regard to the Act of Uniformity and\r\nother such laws, but the opposition was so strong that the proposed\r\ndeclaration of indulgence was abandoned. The terrible fire that broke\r\nout in London (September 1666) and which raged for five days,\r\ndestroying during that time a great part of the city, led to a new\r\noutburst of anti-Catholic feeling. Without the slightest evidence the\r\nfire was attributed to the Papists, and an inscription to this effect\r\nplaced upon the monument erected to commemorate the conflagration\r\nremained unchanged until 1830. When Parliament met a committee was\r\nappointed to inquire into the increase of popery, and a demand was\r\nmade that proclamations should be issued for the banishment of all\r\npriests and Jesuits.\r\n\r\nOn the fall of Clarendon (1667) the Cabal ministers succeeded to\r\npower. These were Clifford, who was a convinced Catholic, Arlington\r\nwho if not a Catholic at this time had at least Catholic tendencies,\r\nBuckingham, Ashley, a man of no fixed religious opinions, and\r\nLauderdale, a Scotch Presbyterian (1670).[17] The contest for the\r\nsuccession to the Spanish throne was at hand, and Louis XIV. was as\r\nanxious to secure the support of England as was Charles to escape from\r\nthe Triple Alliance and the domination of Parliament. Besides, his\r\nbrother James, Duke of York, and heir-presumptive to the English\r\nthrone, had announced his adhesion to the Catholic Church, and his\r\nexample produced such an effect upon the king's mind that he\r\ndetermined to imitate it if only France would promise support. It was\r\nresolved to conclude a secret treaty with France by which Charles\r\nshould pledge himself to profess openly the Catholic religion and to\r\nassist Louis in his schemes against Holland and Belgium, provided that\r\nLouis would supply both money and men to suppress the disturbance to\r\nwhich the king's change of religion might give rise in England. The\r\ntreaty was signed in May 1670, but as Charles was more anxious about\r\nthe subsidies than about the change of religion, and as Louis XIV.\r\npreferred that the religious question should not be raised till the\r\nwar against Holland had been completed, very little, if anything, was\r\ndone, except to publish a Declaration of Indulgence (1672) in which\r\nCharles by virtue of his \"supreme power in ecclesiastical matters\"\r\nsuspended \"all manner of penal laws against whatsoever sort of\r\nNonconformists and Recusants.\" By this document liberty of public\r\nworship was granted to Dissenters, while Catholics were allowed to\r\nmeet for religious service only in private houses.\r\n\r\nA strong Protestant feeling had been aroused in the country by the\r\nrumour of the conversion of the Duke of York, by the certainty that\r\nhis first wife, the daughter of the Earl of Clarendon, had become a\r\nCatholic on her death-bed, and by the suspicion of some secret\r\nnegotiations with France. When Parliament met (1673) a demand was made\r\nthat the Declaration of Indulgence should be withdrawn. The Duke of\r\nYork urged the king to stand firm in the defence of his prerogatives,\r\nbut as neither Charles nor his ally Louis XIV. wished to precipitate a\r\nconflict with the Parliament at that particular period, the king\r\nyielded to the storm by revoking his original declaration. Immediately\r\nthe Test Act was introduced and passed through both houses despite the\r\nwarm opposition of the Duke of York and of Lord Clifford of Chudleigh.\r\nAccording to the terms of this measure it was enacted that all civil\r\nor military officials should be obliged to take the oath of supremacy\r\nand allegiance, to receive Communion according to the English service,\r\nand to make a declaration \"that there is not any Transubstantiation in\r\nthe sacrament of the Lord's Supper, or in the elements of bread and\r\nwine at or after the consecration thereof by any persons whatsoever.\"\r\nJames, Duke of York, resigned his office of Lord High-Admiral and his\r\nexample was followed by Clifford and most of the Catholic noblemen\r\n(1673).\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the Protestant party concentrated their efforts\r\non securing the exclusion of the Duke of York from the English throne.\r\nCharles II. had married Catharine of Braganza, by whom there was no\r\nissue, and consequently his brother was the lawful heir. At the same\r\ntime it was clear to everybody, that James was so firmly attached to\r\nthe Catholic Church that neither the fear of losing the crown nor the\r\nzealous efforts of Stillingfleet and other distinguished ecclesiastics\r\nwere likely to bring about his re-conversion to Protestantism. The\r\nnews, too, of his projected marriage with Mary the daughter of the\r\nDuke of Modena, opening as it did the prospect of a long line of\r\nCatholic rulers in England, was not calculated to allay the fears of\r\nthe Protestants. After he had been dismissed from office the Earl of\r\nShaftesbury set himself deliberately to fan the flames of religious\r\nbigotry, in the hope of securing the exclusion of the Duke of York\r\nfrom the throne. With this object in view it was proposed either that\r\nCharles should procure a divorce from Catharine of Braganza, so as to\r\nbe free to marry some younger lady by whom an heir might be born, or\r\nelse that with the consent of Parliament he should vest the succession\r\nin his illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth. Just then, when feeling\r\nwas running high in England, a wretch named Titus Oates came forward\r\nwith a story of a Popish Plot. Oates, formerly a preacher and minister\r\nof the Established Church, had feigned conversion to Catholicism, and\r\nhad gained admission to the English colleges at Valladolid and St.\r\nOmer from which he was dismissed. Acting in conjunction with Israel\r\nTonge he concocted the details of a plot, according to which the Pope\r\nand the Jesuits were to bring about the murder of the king and the\r\noverthrow of the Protestant religion. His story was so full of\r\ncontradictions and absurdities that it is difficult to understand how\r\nit could have obtained credence among sane men, but in the state of\r\nopinion at the time, it was seized upon by Shaftesbury and others as\r\nthe best means of stirring up a great anti-Catholic agitation that\r\nwould bar the way to the accession of the Duke of York. The mysterious\r\ndeath of Sir Edmund Godfrey, a London magistrate to whom Oates had\r\nentrusted a copy of his depositions, and the discovery of some French\r\ncorrespondence amongst the documents of Father Coleman, the private\r\nsecretary of the Duchess of York, helped to strengthen public belief\r\nin the existence of the plot. When Parliament met in 1678 both houses\r\nprofessed their belief in the existence of a \"damnable and hellish\r\nplot,\" voted a salary to Oates, ordered all Catholics to leave London\r\nand Westminster, procured the arrest of a number of Catholic peers,\r\nand decreed the exclusion of Catholics from the House of Commons and\r\nthe House of Lords by exacting a declaration against the Mass,\r\nTransubstantiation and the invocation of the Blessed Virgin (1678). It\r\nwas only with the greatest difficulty that the king succeeded in\r\nsecuring an exemption in favour of the Duke of York. A number of\r\npriests and laymen were arrested, one of whom was put to death in\r\n1678, eleven in 1679, two in 1680 and one, the Venerable Oliver\r\nPlunket, Archbishop of Armagh, the last victim put to death for\r\nreligion upon English soil, in 1681. In addition to this eight priests\r\nwere put to death during the agitation merely because they were\r\npriests.[18]\r\n\r\nThree times the Exclusion Bill was introduced, but it failed to become\r\nlaw owing to the determination of Charles II. to uphold the rights of\r\nhis brother. At last the storm of passion began to die away, and the\r\nabsurd statements of Oates, even though supported by the testimonies\r\nof infamous hirelings like Bedloe and Dangerfield, were no longer\r\naccepted as trustworthy. Shaftsebury was obliged to make his escape\r\nfrom England; the Duke of York returned from exile to take up his\r\nresidence at court, and for the remainder of the reign of Charles II.\r\nCatholics enjoyed a comparative calm. In February 1685 Charles II.\r\nbecame seriously ill, and died in a short time, after having been\r\nreconciled to the Catholic Church by the ministrations of Father\r\nHudleston, who had helped to save his life years before, and who had\r\nenjoyed the special protection of the king.\r\n\r\nThe accession of James II. (1685-88)[19] was welcomed by the vast\r\nmajority of the English people, who had come to admire his honesty and\r\ncourage, as well as to sympathise with him on account of the violent\r\npersecution to which he had been subjected by his unscrupulous\r\nadversaries. He had made no secret of his religion and of his desire\r\nto abolish the penal laws from which his co-religionists suffered, but\r\nat the same time he declared his intention of maintaining the Church\r\nof England as by law established. The Tory landowners and the cities\r\nwere equally loyal to him, and the first Parliament he called was not\r\nunwilling to do everything to gratify his wishes, provided, however,\r\nhe left religion untouched. When the Duke of Monmouth arrived in\r\nEngland to stir up a rebellion (1685) the country in the main rallied\r\nto the king, although the cry of \"Protestantism in danger\" had been\r\nutilised to stir up discontent.\r\n\r\nThe violent persecution that followed the rebellion, and above all the\r\n\"bloody circuit\" of Judge Jeffreys, whose conduct was unworthy of his\r\njudicial position, helped to dull the edge of the king's popularity.\r\nThe selection of advisers like the unprincipled Earl of Sutherland,\r\nthe position occupied at Court by Father Edmund Petre,[20] the public\r\ncelebration of Mass at which the king assisted in state, and the\r\nopening of direct negotiations with Rome, were calculated to stir up\r\nstrong Protestant opposition. During the rebellion the king had found\r\nit necessary to dispense with the Test Act in the appointment of\r\nofficers, and to raise a well equipped standing army, and people began\r\nto be alarmed lest he should ally himself with Louis XIV., and by\r\nmeans of French subsidies attempt to make himself absolute ruler of\r\nEngland. Parliament met once more in November 1685. The king had set\r\nhis heart on securing a modification of the Test Act, so as to be free\r\nto appoint Catholics to positions of trust, and had dismissed the Earl\r\nof Halifax from the council because he refused to agree to the\r\nproposal. But on the two questions, the maintenance of the Test Act\r\nand of a standing army, Parliament was unbending in its refusal to\r\nmeet the wishes of James II., and was on this account prorogued (Nov.\r\n1685).\r\n\r\nMost of the prominent opponents were dismissed immediately from their\r\noffices. The fact that the late king had embraced the Catholic\r\nreligion before his death was made known officially, and two papers,\r\nin which Charles II. explained the motives which induced him to take\r\nthis step, were given to the public. The papal nuncio at London was\r\nreceived at court, and Lord Castlemaine was dispatched to Rome to act\r\nas the agent of James II. Dr. Leyburn arrived in England as vicar\r\napostolic, to be followed by another in the person of Dr. Giffard, and\r\na little later England was divided into four vicarates, over which\r\nwere placed four vicars with full episcopal orders and jurisdiction.\r\nSeveral of the Protestant ministers, alarmed by these measures, opened\r\na violent campaign against Popery, particularly in London where anti-\r\nCatholic feeling was easily aroused. The king appealed to the Bishop\r\nof London to moderate the fanaticism of his clergy, and as the bishop\r\nwas unable or unwilling to comply with this request, the king\r\nestablished once more a king of High Commission Court, to be presided\r\nover by a number of bishops and laymen, with the avowed object of\r\nkeeping the clergy in subjection.\r\n\r\nAs Parliament had refused to abolish the Test Act James II. determined\r\nto make use of the dispensing powers which he claimed to have as king.\r\nTo compensate for the absence of parliamentary confirmation, it was\r\ndecided to secure the approval of the judges. For this purpose Sir\r\nEdward Hales, a recent convert to Catholicism, was brought into court\r\nfor having accepted and retained a commission in the army without\r\nhaving made the necessary declarations. Hales pleaded as his excuse\r\nthat he had received a dispensation from the king, and that\r\nconsequently he was not obliged to comply with the terms of the Test\r\nAct. The plea was accepted by the judges and the case against the\r\ndefendant was dismissed. As a result of this decision James II. felt\r\nfree to confer civil and military offices on Catholics. Four Catholic\r\npeers, Lord Bellasis, Powys, Arundell of Wardour and Lord Dover, were\r\nsworn in members of the privy council (1687), and later on Father\r\nPetre, a Jesuit, took a seat at the council board. For the latter the\r\nking sought to obtain a bishopric and a cardinal's hat, but Innocent\r\nXI., who was not an admirer of the imprudent haste shown by James II.\r\nfor the conversion of the English nation, nor of his alliance with\r\nLouis XIV., refused to grant either request. By virtue of royal\r\ndispensations a Catholic master and three fellows were appointed to\r\nsome of the Oxford colleges.\r\n\r\nThe Tory party that had been so loyal to the king hitherto, took\r\noffence at the favour shown to the Catholic body, and as there could\r\nbe no hope of winning their approval for the measures he had in\r\ncontemplation, James II. determined to appeal to the Dissenters. The\r\nEarl of Rochester was dismissed from his office, and the Earl of\r\nClarendon was recalled from Ireland. In April 1687 a Declaration of\r\nIndulgence was published, granting freedom of worship to Dissenters\r\nand Catholics, and abolishing all religious tests as necessary\r\nqualifications for office. For a time it seemed as if the king were\r\nlikely to secure the support of the Nonconformists, particularly as\r\nmeasures were taken through the lords-lieutenant of the various\r\ncounties to influence public opinion in their districts. But the\r\nhatred entertained by the Dissenters for Rome overcame their gratitude\r\nto the king for the liberty he had granted them, and they preferred to\r\nlive in bondage rather than allow the Catholics to share with them the\r\nadvantages of religious toleration. The appointment of several\r\nCatholic lords to the very highest offices of state, the public\r\nwelcome given to the papal nuncio, and the attempt to force a Catholic\r\npresident on the fellows of Magdalen College helped to increase the\r\nfeeling of dissatisfaction. Dangerous riots broke out in London, and\r\nto prevent still more dangerous manifestations a force of 16,000 was\r\nconcentrated on Hounslow Heath. In April 1688 a second Declaration of\r\nIndulgence was published. By a order in council, published some days\r\nlater, the clergy were commanded to read this declaration on two\r\nconsecutive Sundays in all their churches.\r\n\r\nA petition was presented to the king by Archbishop Sancroft of\r\nCanterbury and six of his episcopal colleagues requesting him to\r\nwithdraw this command to the clergy (18 May 1688). To make matters\r\nworse thousands of copies of the petition were printed immediately and\r\ncirculated throughout the country. Annoyed by such opposition the king\r\nsummoned the bishops before the council, and as they refused to give\r\nsecurities for their attendance at the trial, they were committed to\r\nprison. The trial opened on the 29th June 1688, and ended with a\r\nverdict of acquittal to the great delight of the vast body of the\r\nEnglish people.\r\n\r\nSo long as James II. had no heir many Protestants were inclined to\r\nkeep silent on the ground that at his death the succession of a\r\nProtestant ruler was assured. But during the popular excitement\r\nfollowing upon the arrest of the bishops the news spread rapidly that\r\nthe queen had given birth to a son. Already negotiations had been\r\nopened up with William of Orange to induce him to take up the cause of\r\nProtestantism in England, but the fact that an heir was born to the\r\nthrone gave a new impetus to the insurrectionary movement. The state\r\nof affairs on the Continent favoured the designs of William of Orange.\r\nLouis XIV. was at war with the Emperor and with the Pope, and as James\r\nII. was regarded as an ally of France no opposition might be expected\r\nfrom the imperial forces in case William determined to make a descent\r\nupon England. Had James II. taken the bold course of inviting Louis\r\nXIV. to assist him, the invasion of England from Holland would have\r\nbeen attended with much more serious difficulties, but till the last\r\nmoment James affected to regard such an invasion as an impossibility.\r\nWhen at last he realised the gravity of the situation he was willing\r\nto make some concessions, but soon, finding himself deserted by a\r\ngreat many of the men on whom he had relied, by some of his own\r\nrelatives, and even by his own daughter, he determined to make his\r\nescape from England (Dec. 1688).\r\n\r\nDuring the weeks that preceded the withdrawal of James II. to France\r\nviolent riots had taken place in London, where several of the Catholic\r\nchapels were attacked, and in many of the other leading cities.\r\nWilliam III. was not personally in favour of a policy of religious\r\npersecution, particularly as he had promised his imperial ally to deal\r\ngently with his Catholic subjects. But the popular prejudice against\r\nthem was so strong that a policy of toleration was almost an\r\nimpossibility. The Catholics were excluded specially from enjoying the\r\nconcessions made in favour of the Dissenters, and in the Bill of\r\nRights (1689) it was provided that no member of the reigning family\r\nwho was a Catholic or had married a Catholic could succeed to the\r\nthrone, and that any sovereign of England who became a Catholic or\r\nmarried a Catholic thereby forfeited the crown. Catholics were\r\nprohibited from residing within ten miles of London; magistrates were\r\nempowered to administer the objectionable oath of allegiance to all\r\nsuspected Papists; Catholics were forbidden to keep arms, ammunition,\r\nor a horse valued for more than ten pounds; they were debarred from\r\npractising as counsellors, barristers, or attorneys; if they refused\r\nto take the oath they were not allowed to vote at parliamentary\r\nelections; they were incapacitated from inheriting or purchasing land;\r\nand prohibited from sending their children abroad for education; while\r\npriests were to be punished with imprisonment for life for celebrating\r\nMass, and spies who secured the conviction of priests were offered\r\n£100 as a reward.[21]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Anne (1702-14) and during the early portion of the\r\nreign of George I. the persecution continued, especially after the\r\nunsuccessful rebellion of 1715 in which many Catholics were accused of\r\ntaking part.[22] After 1722 the violence of the persecution began to\r\nabate, and Catholics began to open schools, and to draw together again\r\ntheir shattered forces. Fortunately at the time there was one amongst\r\nthem in the person of Richard Challoner, who was capable of infusing\r\nnew life into the Catholic ranks and of winning for the Church the\r\nrespect even of its bitterest opponents. Richard Challoner (1691-1781)\r\nwas born in London, and was converted to Catholicism at the age of\r\nthirteen. He entered Douay College, in which he remained twenty-five\r\nyears, first as a student and afterwards as a professor, and vice-\r\npresident. He returned to London in 1730, and threw himself into the\r\nwork of strengthening the faith of his co-religionists in all parts of\r\nthe city. He went about disguised as a layman, visiting the poorest\r\nquarters, and celebrating Mass wherever he could find a place of\r\nsecurity. Already he had published a book of meditations under the\r\ntitle /Think Well On't/ (1728), and a little later he found time to\r\nprepare for the press /The Christian Instructed in the Sacraments,\r\netc/. In 1740, much against his own will, he was appointed coadjutor\r\nto Dr. Petre, vicar-apostolic of the London district. As coadjutor he\r\nundertook to make a visitation of the entire district as far as it was\r\nsituated in England. But his work as bishop did not interfere with his\r\nliterary activity. In quick succession he published /The Gardin of the\r\nSoul/, /The Memoirs of Missionary Priests/, containing the Lives of\r\nthe English Martyrs (1577-1681), the /Britannia Sacra/, or a short\r\naccount of the English, Scottish and Irish Saints, an edition of the\r\nNew Testament (1749), of the old Testament (1750), together with a\r\nrevised edition (1752).\r\n\r\nBesides all this he founded two schools for boys, one at Standon\r\nLordship, the other at Sedgley Park, and one for poor girls at\r\nHammersmith. Though more than once he stood in the gravest danger of\r\nhaving his career cut short by the activity of the priest-hunters, he\r\nhad the good fortune to survive the storm and to see the First Relief\r\nAct of 1778 placed upon the statute book.[23]\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] Frere, op. cit., 289-90.\r\n\r\n[2] Dodd-Tierney, iv., app. no. iv.\r\n\r\n[3] Id., iv., 10-13.\r\n\r\n[4] /Statutes/, 1 James, c. 4.\r\n\r\n[5] On the Gunpowder Plot, cf.

The\r\nking or regent had no standing army at his disposal, nor were the\r\nresources of the royal treasury sufficient to allow the ruler to\r\ninvoke the assistance of foreign mercenaries. As a result the king was\r\ndependent more or less on the lords, who were prepared to support him\r\nif their own demands were conceded, or to form private confederations\r\nor \"bands\" against him if they felt that they themselves were\r\naggrieved. Parliament, which included the spiritual and lay lords,\r\ntogether with representatives of the lower nobility and of the cities,\r\ndid not play a very important part in the government of the country.\r\nFor years Scotland had been the close ally of France and the enemy of\r\nEngland. Such an alliance was at once the best pledge for Scotland's\r\nindependence, and the best guarantee against England's successful\r\ninvasion of France.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to the controversies regarding the primatial rights\r\nclaimed by the Archbishop of York over the Scottish Church, Clement\r\nIII. issued a Bull in 1188 declaring the Church of Scotland subject\r\ndirectly only to the Apostolic See.[1] A further step was taken by\r\nSixtus IV. in 1472, when St. Andrew's was erected into a metropolitan\r\nSee, under which were placed as suffragans the twelve dioceses,\r\nGlasgow, Dunkeld, Aberdeen, Moray, Brechin, Dunblane, Ross, Caithness,\r\nCandida Casa, Argyll, the Isles, and Orkney.[2] This measure was\r\nresented by many of the bishops, but more especially by the Bishops of\r\nGlasgow, who were unwilling to submit to the jurisdiction of St.\r\nAndrew's even after it had been declared that the latter in virtue of\r\nits office enjoyed primatial and legatine powers over Scotland (1487).\r\nIn the hope of putting an end to the controversy Glasgow was erected\r\ninto a metropolitan See with four suffragan dioceses, Dunkeld,\r\nDunblane, Galloway and Argyll (1492). The bishops of Scotland were\r\nsupposed to be elected by the chapters, but in reality the king or\r\nregent enjoyed a decisive voice in the selection of candidates\r\nespecially during the greater part of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this enslavement of the Church, men were appointed to\r\nbishoprics without reference to their fitness for this sacred office,\r\nand solely with the intention of providing themselves and their\r\nrelatives with a decent income. Thus for example, James, Duke of Ross,\r\nbrother of James IV., was appointed to the See of St. Andrew's at the\r\nage of twenty-one, and he was succeeded by Alexander Stuart, the\r\nillegitimate son of James IV., when he had reached only his ninth\r\nyear. What is true of St. Andrew's is almost equally true of many of\r\nthe other dioceses of Scotland, though it would be very wrong to\r\nassume that all the bishops of Scotland during the latter half of the\r\nfifteenth or the first half of the sixteenth centuries were unworthy\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe religious orders of men were well represented by the Benedictines,\r\nCistercians, Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians, etc., while in\r\nmost of the large cities and towns flourishing convents had been\r\nfounded. The state of discipline in these various institutions varied\r\nconsiderably according to circumstances, but although serious attempts\r\nwere made to introduce reforms especially in the houses of the\r\nCistercians, Franciscans, and Dominicans, it cannot be contended for a\r\nmoment that the Scottish monasteries and convents were free from the\r\ngravest abuses. Possibly the erection of such a multitude of\r\ncollegiate churches in Scotland during the fifteenth century was due\r\nto the sad condition of so many of the religious houses, but if it\r\nwas, the remedy was almost as bad as the disease. In connexion with\r\nthe monasteries, the chapters, and the collegiate churches, schools\r\nwere carried on with a fair amount of success, sufficient at least to\r\nprepare students for the higher education given at the Universities of\r\nSt. Andrew's founded by Benedict XIII. (1410), of Glasgow, founded by\r\nNicholas V. (1451), and of Aberdeen established through the exertions\r\nof the learned and holy Bishop Elphinstone with the approval of\r\nAlexander VI. (1495) and of James IV. Owing to the close connexion\r\nwith France many of the Scottish ecclesiastics pursued their studies\r\nat Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Church in Scotland was comparatively wealthy at the beginning of\r\nthe Reformation movement, though it should be remembered that out of\r\nits resources it was obliged to maintain the schools, hospitals, and\r\ninstitutes of charity. Still the wealth of the Church in Scotland\r\ninstead of being a source of strength was in reality a source of\r\nweakness, and in the end it proved to be one of the main causes of its\r\noverthrow. It excited the cupidity of the hungry nobles, and made them\r\nanxious to share in the plunder of religious houses, particularly\r\nafter the example had been set across the border by Henry VIII.'s\r\nattack on the English monasteries. But before any steps were taken to\r\nbring about the forcible seizure of the ecclesiastical property the\r\nrulers and lords of Scotland adopted other means of controlling the\r\nwealth of the Church and of the monasteries. Members of the royal\r\nfamily or sons of the nobles were introduced into the bishoprics\r\nirrespective of their merits, and were induced to enrich their\r\nrelatives by bestowing on them portions of the diocesan property. Many\r\nothers of a similar class were appointed as commendatory abbots of\r\nreligious houses solely for the purpose of controlling the revenue of\r\nthese establishments. In some cases those so appointed were only\r\nchildren, in nearly all cases they were laymen, and in no case did\r\nthey do anything for the maintenance of discipline, for the\r\ncultivation of a good religious spirit, or for the promotion of the\r\nwishes of the founders and endowers of the monastic institutions. What\r\nwas true of the monasteries was equally true of the convents, in many\r\nof which discipline was completely relaxed. Several attempts were made\r\nto bring about a reformation, but on account of the exemptions and\r\nspecial privileges claimed by the religious houses, such attempts were\r\ndoomed to failure, whether they were made by the bishops or by the\r\nregular superiors. Nothing less than a papal visitation, in which the\r\nvisitors could have relied upon the full power of the Church and\r\nState, would have sufficed to put an end to the evil, and\r\nunfortunately no such step was taken in time to avert the calamity.\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere, so too in Scotland, it was no uncommon thing to find one\r\nman holding several benefices to which the care of souls was attached,\r\nnotwithstanding all the canons that had been passed against such a\r\nglaring abuse. The clergy, following the example of so many of their\r\nsuperiors, showed themselves entirely unworthy of their position. Many\r\nof them were quite negligent about preaching and instructing their\r\nflock, completely regardless of clerical celibacy, and oftentimes they\r\ndevoted more attention to their farms and to their cattle than to\r\ntheir religious obligations. One has only to refer to the decrees of\r\nthe diocesan synods held by Archbishop Forman of St. Andrew's (1515-\r\n22),[3] to the national synods of 1549-1552, and to the letter of\r\nCardinal Sermoneta to the Pope in 1557[4] to see how grievous were the\r\nabuses flourishing in all departments of the Church in Scotland at the\r\ntime when the very existence of Catholicism in the kingdom was\r\ntrembling in the balance. The root of all this evil was the\r\ndestruction of the independence of the Church, and its complete\r\nsubjugation to the crown and to the lords. As a result, when the\r\ncrisis came and when most of the lords went over to the party of Knox,\r\nthey found but little resistance from their unworthy relatives, whom\r\nthey had introduced into positions of trust, not that they might\r\npromote religion, but that they might live by it, and in the end\r\nbetray it.\r\n\r\nIt was during the reign of James V. (1513-42) that the religious\r\nrevolution began on the Continent and in England. Henry VIII. of\r\nEngland was his uncle, and he left no stone unturned to detach his\r\nnephew from his alliance with France and from his submission to Rome;\r\nbut despite Henry's endeavours James V. refused to join in Henry's\r\nattacks on the Pope, or to listen to the proposals for a closer union\r\nwith England. The Scottish Parliament held in 1525 forbade the\r\nintroduction of Lutheran books into the kingdom or the preaching of\r\nLuther's doctrine, and a papal envoy was dispatched to the Scottish\r\ncourt to exhort the king to stand firm in the defence of the Church.\r\nThe reply of James V. was reassuring. Soon however the new heresy\r\nbegan to make its appearance in the kingdom. Patrick Hamilton,\r\ncommendatory abbot of Ferne and closely related to some of the most\r\npowerful families in Scotland, had come into contact with Luther and\r\nMelanchthon during his wanderings on the Continent, and on his return\r\nhome he set himself to spread their teachings amongst his countrymen.\r\nHe was arrested, tried for heresy, and handed over to the secular\r\nauthorities who inflicted the death penalty (1528). His execution did\r\nnot put an end to the movement in Scotland. In 1533 the Benedictine,\r\nHenry Forest, was condemned to death for heresy; in the following year\r\na priest and a layman met a similar fate, and before the death of\r\nJames V. several others including Dominicans and Franciscans, laymen\r\nand clerics, were either burned or obliged to seek safety in flight.\r\nJames V. set himself resolutely to the task of suppressing heresy, and\r\nwas supported by Parliament, which forbade all discussion on Luther's\r\nerrors except in so far as it might be necessary for their refutation,\r\nand ordered all who had Lutheran writings in their possession to\r\ndeliver them to the bishops within a period of fourteen days.\r\n\r\nPolitical influences, however, favoured the spread of the new\r\ndoctrine. It had been the dream of Henry VII., as it was also the\r\ndream of his son and successor, to strengthen England at the expense\r\nof France, by bringing about an alliance and if possible a union\r\nbetween England and Scotland. It was in furtherance of this design\r\nthat Henry VII. had given his eldest daughter in marriage to James\r\nIV., who was slain with most of his nobles in a battle with the\r\nEnglish on the fatal field of Flodden (1513). The schemes for a union\r\nwith Scotland were continued by Henry VIII., particularly after his\r\nrupture with Rome had shown him the danger that might be anticipated\r\nfrom the north in case the French or the Emperor should declare war in\r\ndefence of the Church. A regular contest began at the Scottish court\r\nbetween the friends of Rome and of France and the agents of Henry\r\nVIII., the latter of whom took care to encourage those who favoured\r\nreligious innovations. The queen-mother, sister of Henry VIII., and\r\nmany of the nobles favoured the plans of Henry, who sought to induce\r\nthe King of Scotland to join him in the struggle against Rome, and who\r\npromised him in return for this service the hand of his daughter the\r\nPrincess Mary and the friendship of the English nation. James V.,\r\nbacked by the bishops and encouraged by messengers from Rome, refused\r\nto come south for a conference with Henry VIII., or to give any\r\ncountenance to the schismatical policy of his uncle. As a sign that\r\nScotland was still true to France he married the daughter of Francis\r\nI. of France (1537), and on her death shortly after her arrival in\r\nScotland, he took as his second wife (1538) Mary of Guise, daughter of\r\nthe Duke of Guise and sister of the Cardinal of Lorraine.[5]\r\n\r\nHe was ably assisted in his struggle against heresy and English\r\ninterference by David Beaton, Archbishop of St. Andrew's (1539-46) and\r\na cardinal of the Roman Church. The latter was at once a churchman and\r\na politician, loyal to Rome and to France, earnest in his defence of\r\nScottish independence, and determined to defeat the English schemes\r\nagainst both the religion and liberty of Scotland. As friendly\r\nremonstrances and invitations failed to produce any effect, Henry\r\nVIII. determined to have recourse to war. He felt that he could rely\r\nupon the assistance or the neutrality of many of the Scottish nobles\r\nwhom he had won over to his side, and soon events showed that this\r\nconfidence was not misplaced. The Scottish army was put to a shameful\r\nflight at Solway Moss, probably more by treachery than by the\r\ncowardice of the Scottish nobles, and James V. was so heartbroken by\r\nthe news of this disaster that he died in a few weeks (Dec. 1542)\r\nleaving behind him an infant daughter, to be known later as Mary Queen\r\nof Scots.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of James V. the Earl of Arran, who as one of the\r\nHamiltons was next after the king's daughter the heir-presumptive to\r\nthe throne, and who favoured the new religion and English influence,\r\nwas appointed regent despite the resistance of Cardinal Beaton and of\r\nthe clergy. Henry VIII. believed that the favourable moment had come\r\nfor carrying out his plans. He hoped to be able to imprison his old\r\nenemy Cardinal Beaton, to seize the person of the young princess, to\r\narrange for a marriage between her and his own son Prince Edward, and\r\nto make himself virtual sovereign of Scotland. To their shame be it\r\nsaid he induced a number of the Scottish nobles, the Douglasses, the\r\nEarls of Cassilis, Glencairn, Bothwell, and Angus, together with many\r\nothers, to agree to his designs and to promise their assistance.\r\nUnmindful of their duty to Scotland they consented to sell both their\r\ncountry and their religion for English gold. The regent was only too\r\nwilling to lend his aid, and before the end of January the English\r\nagents were able to announce to \"their Sovereign Lord\" that the\r\ncardinal was a prisoner. Everything seemed to favour the religious\r\nchange and the plans of union with England. Parliament met in March\r\n1543. It decreed liberty to all to read or to have in their possession\r\na copy of the Bible in the English or the Scottish tongue, and\r\nappointed commissioners to treat with Henry for the marriage of Mary\r\nto his son. But popular opinion in Scotland supported strongly the\r\nreligious and political policy of Cardinal Beaton. The clergy of the\r\ndiocese of St. Andrew's refused to continue their ministrations until\r\ntheir archbishop was released. The people supported them in their\r\ndemands, as did several of the nobles, and in the end, despite the\r\nprotests of the English party, among the lords, the cardinal was set\r\nat liberty. The regent, the Earl of Arran, deserted his former\r\nfriends, became reconciled with the Catholic Church, joined himself to\r\nthe party of the cardinal and of the queen dowager, and welcomed the\r\narrival of the French forces that had come to defend the kingdom\r\nagainst an English invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish nobles in the pay of Henry VIII. were convinced, as was\r\nHenry VIII. himself, that so long as Cardinal Beaton was alive to\r\nguide affairs in Scotland no advance could be made in the work of\r\ndestroying both the religion and the independence of the kingdom.\r\nSeveral of the Scottish enemies of the cardinal entered into\r\ncommunication with Henry himself or with his agents. They offered to\r\nmurder the cardinal if only Henry promised a sufficient reward, and\r\nHenry expressed his approval of the step that was in contemplation.[6]\r\nMeanwhile the cardinal was busy preparing schemes for a genuine reform\r\nof the Church to be submitted to a national synod called for January\r\n1546, and in making a visitation of his diocese for the purpose of\r\nsuppressing heresy. George Wishart, formerly a Greek master at\r\nMontrose, had returned from the Continent, and had begun to stir up\r\nreligious dissension in several cities of Scotland. He was the close\r\nally of the Scottish lords who were in the pay of Henry VIII., and he\r\nhimself was the trusted messenger employed by Crichton, Lord of\r\nBrunston, to communicate to the English court the projected murder of\r\nCardinal Beaton and the destruction of certain religious houses in\r\nScotland.[7] The cardinal, who was probably aware of his plots as well\r\nas of his preachings, secured his arrest, and brought him to St.\r\nAndrew's, where he was tried and executed for heresy (1546). The news\r\nof the execution created considerable commotion especially in those\r\ncentres where Wishart had preached, and gave new impetus to the\r\nmovement for the assassination of the cardinal. In May 1546 some of\r\nthe family of Leslie, who had grievances of their own to revenge, with\r\na number of other accomplices secured an entrance to the palace of the\r\nArchbishop of St. Andrew's, put his servants and attendants to flight,\r\nand murdered him before any help could be summoned. The murder of\r\nCardinal Beaton was an irreparable misfortune for the Catholic Church\r\nin Scotland. He was at once an able churchman and a patriot,\r\ndetermined to maintain the independence of his country against the\r\ngroup of pro-English traitors, who were determined to change the\r\nreligion of Scotland at the bidding of Scotland's greatest enemy. John\r\nKnox, a fanatical priest, who had gone over to the new religion,\r\nwelcomed the murder of the cardinal as a veritable triumph for the\r\ngospel and as a \"godly act.\" He hastened to join the murderers who had\r\ntaken possession of the castle of St. Andrew's, and to whom he\r\npreached as the first reformed congregation in Scotland.[8] Henry\r\nVIII., no less jubilant for the disappearance of his strongest\r\nopponent, was not slow to assist the murderers.\r\n\r\nBut the assassination of the cardinal did not mean the triumph of the\r\nEnglish party. It served only to embitter the feelings of the vast\r\nmajority of the people, and to force the regent and queen-dowager to\r\nthrow themselves more unreservedly into the arms of France. A French\r\nfleet arrived at Leith and forced the murderers assembled in the\r\ncastle of St. Andrew's to surrender. Those of them who were not\r\nfortunate enough to make their escape were taken prisoners and\r\ncondemned to the French galleys. An English army led by the Duke of\r\nSomerset marched into Scotland to enforce the English demands, and\r\nespecially to secure the person of the infant queen. But though it\r\ninflicted considerable havoc on Scotland, particularly on several of\r\nthe religious houses, and though it overthrew the forces of the regent\r\nin the battle of Pinkie (1547), it was obliged to re-cross the borders\r\nwithout having secured the submission of the nation. In the following\r\nyear (1548) a new French force arrived in England to assist the Scotch\r\nin their struggle against England. A Scottish Parliament renewed the\r\nalliance with France, approved of the betrothal of the young queen to\r\nthe Dauphin of France, and determined to provide for the safety of her\r\nperson by sending her into France. After several fruitless attempts\r\nmade by the English to secure a foothold in Scotland they were obliged\r\nto give up the contest in despair, and to conclude a nine years'\r\npeace. For so far the alliance between Catholicism and independence\r\nhad won the victory against heresy and English influence (1550).\r\n\r\nThe murder of Cardinal Beaton helped to force the bishops and clergy\r\nto realise the danger of their position. They urged the regent to take\r\nstern measures in defence of the church, and what was of much more\r\nimportance they attempted to set their own house in order as the best\r\npreparation for the conflict. John Hamilton, brother of the regent,\r\nwas appointed Archbishop of St. Andrew's in succession to Cardinal\r\nBeaton (1547). He assembled a national synod at Edinburgh (1549) which\r\nwas attended by the bishops, abbots, and representatives of the\r\nchapters, religious houses, and collegiate churches.[9] Though the\r\npresence of men like Lord James Stuart, the illegitimate son of James\r\nV., as commendatory prior of St. Andrew's was not calculated to\r\ninspire confidence in the decrees of the assembly, a very wholesome\r\nscheme of reform was carried through, which, had it been enforced,\r\nmight have gone far to save Catholicism in Scotland. Severe laws were\r\npassed against concubinage of the clergy, their neglect of their\r\nprimary duties of preaching and instructing their flocks, and against\r\nthe alienation of ecclesiastical property. Measures were taken to\r\nensure that priests should explain the principal points of Catholic\r\ndoctrine and the Scriptures regularly in their principal churches.\r\nAnother synod held in 1552 continued the work of reform. Its\r\nreferences to the question of marriage and to the non-attendance of\r\nthe people at their religious duties seem to indicate that religion\r\nwas not then in a flourishing condition. The synods ordered the\r\npublication of a catechism, and enjoined all priests who had care of\r\nsouls to explain a portion of it every Sunday before the principal\r\nMass. In accordance with this decree an excellent catechism[10]\r\ncontaining a very full exposition of Catholic doctrine was published.\r\nHad it come earlier, or had the clergy even then been able and willing\r\nto explain it to their people, Knox and his companions might have\r\nfound themselves confronted with a much more difficult task.\r\n\r\nMary of Guise had shown great abilities during the contest with Henry\r\nVIII. and the Protector. Though the Earl of Arran was nominally regent\r\nit was she who guided his counsels and inspired his policy. The French\r\ngovernment, distrustful of the regent who was also the next claimant\r\nfor the Scottish throne, induced him to resign his office, for which\r\nhe received in return the empty title of Duke of Châtelherault, and\r\nMary of Guise undertook the government of Scotland for her infant\r\ndaughter. About the ability of the new regent or her devotion to the\r\nCatholic Church there could be no difference of opinion, but\r\nunfortunately she was more anxious to strengthen the French hold upon\r\nScotland than to take the necessary measures for the peace of the\r\nkingdom and the suppression of heresy. She filled her fortresses with\r\nFrench subjects, showing thereby that in her opinion Scotchmen could\r\nnot be trusted. As a result she gave great offence to the native\r\nlords, aroused Scottish patriotism against France as it had been\r\naroused against England by the aggressive policy of Henry VIII., and\r\nprepared the way for the dissolution of the alliance between\r\npatriotism and Catholicism, an alliance that had hitherto been the\r\nmain barrier against the success of the reforming English party.\r\n\r\nThe Scots began to fear that with their young queen united in marriage\r\nto the King of France Scotland stood in danger of becoming a French\r\nprovince, and though the Scottish Parliament took care to safeguard\r\nthe independence of the country in the marriage settlement drawn up in\r\n1558, the leading men had grave suspicions that the agreement would\r\nhave little effect. Besides, Mary of Guise had no longer anything to\r\nfear from English Protestantism, which was rendered powerless after\r\nthe accession of Queen Mary. England was now united to Spain, the\r\nmortal enemy of France, and French political interests would best be\r\nserved by maintaining an attitude of friendly neutrality towards\r\nEnglish Protestants, who were likely to prove more dangerous to\r\nSpanish designs than to France. Such a policy of neutrality might\r\nresult, too, it was thought, in securing the throne of England for the\r\nyoung Scottish queen, whose claims as the nearest legitimate heir\r\ncould not be questioned. For these reasons the regent was not\r\nunwilling to allow Protestant refugees to take up their residence in\r\nScotland, and to permit the followers of the new religion to continue\r\ntheir campaign so long as they did not disturb the public peace. In\r\nher correspondence with the Pope she paid little attention to the\r\nreligious danger that was threatening the kingdom, and seemed to be\r\nmore anxious to obtain permission to tax the clergy than to secure an\r\nenergetic reform of the abuses that she painted in such dark\r\ncolours.[11] The Scottish lords, many of whom were offended by the\r\npreponderance of French soldiers and French officials, were only too\r\nwilling to assist the new preachers, and what was worse, to stir up\r\ntheir clansmen against the old religion by holding up the bishops and\r\nclergy as the friends of France and the enemies of Scottish\r\nindependence. National patriotism was now utilised to help forward the\r\ncause of Protestantism, by the very men who a few years before had\r\nagreed to betray their country for English gold, and had striven with\r\nall their might to make Henry VIII. the protector of Scotland.\r\n\r\nSome Protestant refugees from England were soon at work in different\r\ncentres of the country, and encouraged by the regent's policy of\r\nneutrality, the man, who was destined to be the apostle of the\r\nReformation, returned to his native land (1555). John Knox,[12] who\r\nhad shown his devotion to the Gospel by applauding the murder of\r\nCardinal Beaton as a \"godly act,\" and who had founded the first\r\nreformed congregation among the murderers gathered in the castle of\r\nSt. Andrew's, having been released from the French galleys, became a\r\npensioner of Edward VI., and took up his residence in some of the\r\nnorthern towns of England. In a short time he was appointed royal\r\nchaplain, and might have had the Bishopric of Rochester had he not\r\nexpressed the view that such an office was incompatible with devotion\r\nto the true evangelical religion. On the accession of Queen Mary he\r\nfled from England to Geneva, from which he returned to Scotland in\r\n1555. His violent and overbearing manner, his extravagant\r\ndenunciations of his opponents, his misrepresentations of their\r\nactions and policy, and his readiness both as a speaker and as a\r\nwriter, qualified him perfectly for the leadership of a revolutionary\r\nparty, were it not that at certain critical moments his anxiety to\r\navoid personal danger was calculated to shake the confidence of his\r\nfollowers. He was welcomed by many of the discontented nobles, amongst\r\nothers by Lord Erskine afterwards Earl of Mar, Lord Lorne and his\r\nfather the Earl of Argyll, Maitland Lord of Lethington, the Earl of\r\nGlencairn, and Lord James Stuart prior of St. Andrew's, who as Earl of\r\nMoray was soon to betray his sister, Mary Queen of Scots.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the protection of such powerful patrons he preached\r\nfreely and with great success in several districts of Scotland. The\r\nclansmen were so united to their lords that they were prepared to\r\nfollow their example even in matters of religion. The bishops and the\r\nregent, to whom these proceedings must have been known, were strangely\r\noblivious to their duties, and when at last they mustered up\r\nsufficient courage to summon Knox to appear at Edinburgh (1556), they\r\nwere so alarmed by the strength of his following that they abandoned\r\nthe trial. Knox, encouraged by their cowardice, preached openly in the\r\ncapital, and even went so far as to address a letter to the regent\r\ncalling upon her to open her mind for the reception of the truth.[13]\r\nBy this public challenge, however, he overshot the mark, and not being\r\ngifted with any particular desire to suffer martyrdom for the faith,\r\nhe left Scotland suddenly and retired to the Continent (1556). For\r\nyears he was the leading spirit in many of the fierce and unseemly\r\ndisputes between the English Protestant exiles in Geneva and\r\nFrankfurt. Although summoned more than once by his followers to\r\nreturn, he contented himself with sending them written exhortations to\r\nstand firm in the faith, or by publishing violent pamphlets such as\r\n/The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of\r\nWomen/, in which he undertook to prove that the rule of women is\r\nrepugnant to nature, contrary to God's ordinances, and subversive of\r\ngood order, equity, and justice. Though this document was aimed\r\nprincipally against Catharine de' Medici, Queen Mary of England, and\r\nMary of Guise regent of Scotland, it rankled in the mind of Queen\r\nElizabeth after her accession, and did not serve to raise the apostle\r\nof Scotland in her estimation.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant lords, undeterred by the absence of Knox, decided to go\r\nforward with their programme. In December 1557 the Earl of Argyll, his\r\nson Lord Lorne, Glencairn, Morton, Erskine of Dun, and others, met at\r\nEdinburgh and signed a bond or covenant, by which they bound\r\nthemselves solemnly to establish the \"Blessed Word of God,\" to\r\nencourage preachers, to defend the new doctrines even with their\r\nlives, and to maintain the Congregation of Christ in opposition to the\r\nCongregation of Satan. They pledged themselves to introduce the Book\r\nof Common Prayer, to insist on the reading of portions of the\r\nScriptures in the vulgar tongue on Sundays and holidays, and to\r\nappoint preachers wherever the Catholic clergy were unable or\r\nunwilling to undertake this work.[14] In many districts, where the\r\nlords of the Congregation held sway, measures were taken at once to\r\nenforce these resolutions. Confronted with this revolutionary step,\r\nthe regent and the bishops should have had recourse to strong action,\r\nbut the former was so interested in the approaching marriage of her\r\ndaughter to the Dauphin of France (1558) that she did not wish to\r\noffend the lords, while the primate, as one of the Hamiltons, disliked\r\nthe regent because she had supplanted his brother, and contented\r\nhimself with gentle admonitions. The lords, confident in their\r\nstrength, met in November 1558, and presented a petition to the\r\nregent, in which they demanded that the members of the Congregation\r\nshould be allowed to meet in the churches, and to follow their own\r\nritual in the vulgar tongue, that Communion should be administered\r\nunder both kinds, that private individuals should be at liberty to\r\nexplain difficult passages of the Sacred Scriptures, and that the\r\nclergy should be reformed. The regent after consultation with the\r\nprimate consented to these requests, at least in regard to private\r\nreligious assemblies, but refused to yield to another petition\r\ndemanding the abolition of all laws against heresy.[15]\r\n\r\nThe religious controversies became more and more embittered during the\r\nyear 1559. The lords of the Congregation denounced the abuses of the\r\nclergy, demanded permission to use the vulgar tongue in all public\r\nreligious services as well as in the administration of the sacraments,\r\nand insisted on the admission of the lower nobles and of the people to\r\na voice in the appointment of bishops and of pastors. To put an end to\r\nthe abuses that were proving such a useful weapon in the hands of the\r\nadversaries of the Church, and at the same time to give public and\r\nformal expression to the faith of the Scottish nation, a national\r\nsynod[16] met at Edinburgh (April 1559). It denounced once again the\r\nawful scandal of concubinage among the clergy, laid down useful\r\nregulations regarding preaching and the appointment of bishops,\r\ncondemned plurality of benefices, nonresidence, and demands on the\r\npart of the clergy for excessive fees. To raise the standard of\r\neducation among the clergy it ordained that those presented to\r\nbenefices should be examined, and that each monastery should maintain\r\nsome of its members at the universities. In its profession of faith\r\nthe synod emphasised the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist,\r\nTransubstantiation, the propitiatory character of the sacrifice of the\r\nMass, the sufficiency of Communion in one kind, the existence of a\r\nreal priesthood, and purgatory, prayers for the dead, invocation of\r\nthe saints, fasting, and holidays. In response to the demands of the\r\nCongregation the synod pointed out that it had not the power to change\r\nthe rites and ceremonies that had been handed down for centuries, that\r\nas the Church was the definitely appointed guardian and interpreter of\r\nthe Scriptures private individuals were not permitted to expound them\r\nat their will, and that in the appointment of bishops and pastors the\r\nrules laid down in canon law were quite sufficient to prevent abuses\r\nif only they were followed.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Quintin Kennedy, Benedictine Abbot of Crossraguel,\r\nconferred an immense service on religion by his written apology[17]\r\nfor the Catholic Church. Starting with the Bible and its relation to\r\necclesiastical authority, he undertook to show that from the very\r\nnature of the case such a book required the presence of a divinely\r\nappointed official interpreter, that the reading of the Scriptures was\r\nnot necessary for salvation though in many cases it might be useful,\r\nand that the authority of the Church should not be overthrown even\r\nthough the existence of scandals among churchmen could not be denied.\r\nTurning to his adversaries, he demanded what was the source of all the\r\nabuses and scandals which they charged against the Church? Was it not,\r\nhe asked, the unwarrantable interference of the nobles in the\r\nnominations to ecclesiastical benefices, an interference that was\r\nresponsible for having even children who were too young to hold an\r\napple in their hands appointed to the charge of populous parishes, in\r\norder that the relatives of these children might grow rich on the\r\nrevenues, and was it not the very men who were guilty of such conduct\r\nwho were loudest in their denunciation of the Church? On the nobles he\r\nlaid the blame for oppressing the Church, for introducing unworthy\r\necclesiastics into offices of trust, for depriving the poor of\r\ninstruction and education, and for promoting thereby heresy and\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nAs the year (1559) advanced the state of affairs in Scotland became\r\ndaily more alarming. Preachers were everywhere at work under the\r\nprotection of the lords. The regent and the French authorities, who\r\nhad shown a fatal apathy in their dealings with Scottish heretics,\r\nbegan to wake up to the political danger involved in such a movement.\r\nA French agent, M. Béthencourt,[18] arrived in Scotland in April 1559,\r\nand, whether it was due to his advice or not, the regent forbade the\r\npreachers to continue their disturbances. On their refusal to submit\r\nshe summoned them to appear at Stirling for trial (10th May).\r\nEncouraged by the return of Knox who had landed at Leith early in the\r\nsame month, and by the armed forces placed at their disposal by some\r\nof their principal patrons, they refused to attend and were outlawed.\r\nA number of the reforming lords immediately took possession of Perth,\r\nand destroyed several Catholic churches in the city. When news of this\r\nrising reached the regent she assembled her forces and marched against\r\nPerth, but as neither side was anxious for civil war at the time, a\r\ntruce was agreed upon, and the forces of the regent were allowed to\r\noccupy the town. From Perth the reforming lords retreated to St.\r\nAndrew's, where they burned and destroyed the altars, pictures,\r\nstatues, and even the sacred vessels used for religious worship. The\r\nabbey church of Scone, in which a long line of Scottish kings had been\r\ncrowned, was destroyed; Perth and Stirling were seized, and before the\r\nend of June 1559 Edinburgh was in the hands of the lords of the\r\nCongregation. The regent issued an appeal in the name of the king and\r\nqueen of Scotland calling upon all loyal subjects to defend the\r\ngovernment against the revolutionary Congregation, but her unfortunate\r\npreference for French soldiers and officials gave the Protestant lords\r\nthe advantage of enabling them to pose as patriots engaged in the\r\ndefence of their country against foreigners. They were forced,\r\nhowever, to capitulate and to surrender Edinburgh to the regent (26th\r\nJuly).\r\n\r\nEarly in this same month (1559) Henry II. of France died, and was\r\nsucceeded by Francis II., the husband of Mary Queen of Scots.\r\nElizabeth and her advisers were alarmed at the prospect that opened\r\nbefore them. Mary Queen of Scots, as the nearest legitimate heir to\r\nthe English throne, was a dangerous neighbour, especially at a time\r\nwhen England was thrown into confusion by a new religious revolution,\r\nand when English Catholics might rally to her standard with the\r\nblessing of the Pope and of the Kings of France and Spain. Even though\r\nthe Queen of Scotland did not resort to extremes, the very existence\r\nof a Catholic kingdom in Scotland, united by bonds of friendship and\r\ninterest to France, constituted a grave danger for England; whereas if\r\nScotland could be induced to accept the Protestant religion and to\r\nthrow in its lot with its southern neighbour, the enemies of England\r\non the Continent might rage in vain. The rebellion of the lords of the\r\nCongregation was, therefore, very welcome to Elizabeth and to Cecil.\r\nIt gave them an opportunity of interfering in Scottish affairs, not,\r\nindeed, in the untactful manner in which Henry VIII. had interfered,\r\nbut as the apparent defenders of Scottish independence against a\r\nFrench protectorate. On this occasion Scottish patriotism was to be\r\nmade subservient to English political aims and at the same time to\r\nProtestant interests.\r\n\r\nThe lords of the Congregation, realising that without assistance they\r\ncould never hope to overcome the regent, turned to England for\r\nsupport. Their petitions were welcomed by Cecil and the leading\r\ncounsellors of Elizabeth, but the queen herself distrusted Knox, and\r\ndisliked allying herself with open rebels. To give the movement an\r\nappearance of constitutionalism the young Earl of Arran, who had been\r\nbrought to France and who had secretly embraced Calvinism, was induced\r\nto make his escape into England. As a near claimant to the Scottish\r\nthrone he was welcomed at the English court, and was led to believe\r\nthat if he acted prudently he might become the husband of Elizabeth,\r\nand the king of a united England and Scotland. He was dispatched into\r\nScotland, where he succeeded in detaching his father, the Duke of\r\nChâtelherault, and several other nobles from the side of the regent.\r\nRelying on the protection of England, from which a plentiful supply of\r\nmoney was dispatched to the rebels, and on the new accessions to their\r\nranks, the lords of the Congregation announced the suspension of the\r\nregent from her office (Oct. 1559) though they hesitated to take the\r\nfurther step of proclaiming the Earl of Arran or Lord James Stuart\r\nsovereign of Scotland. The regent replied to this act of rebellion by\r\nmarching on Edinburgh, forcing the rebels to retreat to Stirling\r\n(Nov.), while the Earl of Bothwell seized large sums of money that\r\nwere being forwarded to the rebel camp from England. The English\r\nadvisers began to realise that money and secret assistance were not\r\nenough to secure the triumph of the Congregation in Scotland, and that\r\nthe time had come when more decisive measures must be taken.\r\n\r\nIn December 1559 and January 1560, an armed force was dispatched to\r\nthe north, and Admiral Winter was commanded to blockade the Forth\r\nagainst a French fleet. A little later a formal agreement was\r\nconcluded between the Duke of Norfolk representing Elizabeth, and Lord\r\nJames Stuart the commissioner for the Congregation. At first it was\r\nproposed to act in common for \"the maintenance of the Christian\r\nreligion,\" but as these words might have given rise to serious\r\ncomplications on the Continent, it was decided that an alliance should\r\nbe concluded for the defence of the ancient rights and liberties of\r\nScotland. An English army of eight thousand men marched into Scotland,\r\nand the English fleet blockaded the fortress of Leith which was the\r\nkey to the capital. Owing to the Huguenot risings in France the\r\nassistance that had been promised could not be sent, but nevertheless\r\nthe invaders were thrown back in their first assault. In June 1560,\r\nhowever, Mary of Guise, worn out by the anxieties and cares of her\r\ndifficult office, passed away, and three weeks later the garrison was\r\nobliged to surrender. English and French plenipotentiaries met to\r\narrange the terms of peace. It was agreed that the French soldiers,\r\nwith the exception of about one hundred and twenty men, should be\r\ndrafted from Scotland, that no foreigners should be promoted to any\r\noffice in the kingdom, that until the arrival of the king and queen\r\nthe country should be governed by a council of twelve, seven of whom\r\nwere to be selected by Mary and Francis and five by the Parliament,\r\nthat the entire question of religion should be submitted to a Scottish\r\nParliament convoked to meet on the 1st August (1560), and that, in the\r\nmeantime, a kind of religious truce should be observed by both sides.\r\nIt was agreed, furthermore, that the spiritual peers should hold their\r\nseats in Parliament as before, and that they should not be disturbed\r\nin their ecclesiastical possessions.\r\n\r\nThe successful invasion of Scotland by the English troops had turned\r\nthe scales in favour of the lords of the Congregation. They were now\r\nmasters in Scotland, but, had the bishops and clergy been zealous men\r\nworthy of their sacred office, the cause of the old Church in Scotland\r\nwould not have been even then hopeless. While Knox and his friends\r\nwere straining every nerve to consolidate their work by the\r\nappointment of preachers and superintendents for the rising\r\ncongregation, many of the Catholic bishops and abbots, several of whom\r\nwere allied by blood and friendship with the lay lords, either\r\ncontented themselves with doing nothing, or went over to the enemies\r\nof the Church for the sake of securing for themselves and their\r\ndescendants the ecclesiastical property that they administered. The\r\nArchbishop of St. Andrew's and Primate of Scotland was the brother of\r\nthe Earl of Arran. Though a convinced Catholic himself, he was not the\r\nman either to make a struggle or to inspire confidence at such a\r\ncrisis. Archbishop Beaton of Glasgow had fled already from the\r\nkingdom; the Bishop of Argyll, another illegitimate scion of the house\r\nof Hamilton, was a Protestant or was soon to become one; Adam\r\nBothwell,[19] whom the Pope had appointed the previous year to the See\r\nof Orkney on the petition of the king and queen of Scotland, could not\r\nbe trusted, as his subsequent conduct showed; Alexander Gordon, who\r\nclaimed to be Bishop of Galloway, though he was never consecrated, had\r\ngone over openly to the enemies of the Church, as had also the\r\nprovincial of the Dominicans, the sub-prior of the chapter of St.\r\nAndrew's, and John Rowe a former agent of the Scottish bishops at the\r\nRoman Court. With men such as these to guard the interests of\r\nCatholicism in Scotland there could be little doubt about the result.\r\n\r\nIn August 1560 the Parliament met at Edinburgh. In addition to the lay\r\nlords and representatives of the lesser nobles and of the cities,\r\nthere were present a number of bishops and abbots. Amongst these\r\nlatter it is interesting and instructive to note the presence of Lord\r\nJames Stuart, the bastard brother of the queen and one of the leaders\r\nof the Congregation, as prior of St. Andrew's, of Lord James Hamilton\r\nson of the Earl of Arran and a follower of Knox as abbot of Arbroath,\r\nof John Stuart abbot of Coldingham, of the son of the Duke of Argyll\r\nas bishop-elect of Brechin, together with a number of other laymen,\r\nwho, though holding high office in the Church, were determined to\r\npromote the new movement for the sake of the property that they hoped\r\nto obtain. The discussion opened under the presidency of Maitland,\r\nLord of Lethington, the Scottish Cecil, a double dealer who was even\r\nmore dangerous than an open enemy. A petition was presented\r\nimmediately on the part of Knox and his friends that doctrines such as\r\nTransubstantiation, the sacrificial character of the Mass, Purgatory,\r\nprayers for the dead, meritorious works, etc., which had been forced\r\nupon the people by the clergy should be rejected. A confession of\r\nfaith was drafted and submitted to the assembly. The Primate and the\r\nCatholic bishops present protested against the discussion of such a\r\ndocument on the ground that according to the terms of the Treaty of\r\n1560 the religious question should have been submitted previously to\r\nthe king and queen, and also because the treaty had never been\r\nconfirmed owing to the fact that the French commissioners had exceeded\r\ntheir instructions. It was no doubt for this reason that a large\r\nnumber of the ecclesiastical and lay lords who were strongly Catholic\r\nhad refused to attend the Parliament. Indeed the supporters of the old\r\nreligion, relying on the help of the queen, seemed to think that any\r\nreligious settlement made by Parliament was of no importance. Their\r\nrefusal to discuss the confession of faith was taken, however, as a\r\nsign of their inability to refute it, and the confession was passed\r\nwith but few dissentients. Later on (24th August) three other acts\r\nwere formulated with the object of uprooting Catholicism in Scotland.\r\nThe jurisdiction of the Pope was abolished, and the bishops were\r\nforbidden to act under his instructions; all previous Acts of\r\nParliament contrary to God's word or to the confession of faith as now\r\napproved were declared null and void; and all persons were forbidden\r\nto celebrate or to hear Mass under pain of confiscation of their goods\r\nfor the first offence, banishment for the second, and death for the\r\nthird.[20]\r\n\r\n/The Book of Discipline/ which contained an exposition of the\r\necclesiastical policy of the Scottish Reformers was compiled by Knox\r\nand his companions. It dealt with the preaching of the Scriptures, the\r\ntwo sacraments Baptism and the Eucharist, the suppression of religious\r\nhouses of all kinds, the election and appointment of ministers, elders\r\nand deacons, and with the means to be provided for their support and\r\nfor the maintenance of education. Though the separate congregations\r\nwere left more or less free regarding the kind of religious service\r\nthat should be followed, the Book of Common Prayer formerly accepted\r\nin Scotland was abolished to make way for the Calvinistic Book of\r\nCommon Order. In the general assemblies of the reformed Church\r\n(December 1560-May 1561) decrees were issued for the destruction of\r\nthe religious houses and of all signs of idolatry, and individuals\r\nwere appointed to see that these decrees were put into immediate\r\nexecution.[21]\r\n\r\nBoth parties in Scotland turned instinctively to their queen. Mary had\r\nbeen married in 1558, and in 1559 her husband succeeded to the throne\r\nof France under the title of Francis II. A minister was dispatched to\r\ninform her of the proceedings in Parliament, but she refused to\r\nconfirm the terms of the treaty with England, or to sanction the\r\nchanges that had been decreed. The death of her husband Francis II.\r\n(1560) threw her into great grief and forced her to consider the\r\nquestion of returning at once to her kingdom. She believed that many\r\nof those who opposed her previously, lest Scotland should become a\r\nFrench province, might now abandon their league with Elizabeth, and\r\nwelcome home their own lawful sovereign. Nor was there anything at\r\nthis time to indicate that Mary had any intention of playing the part\r\nof a champion of Catholicism,[22] or of running the risk of forfeiting\r\nher throne in Scotland or her claims to the English crown by\r\nundertaking a campaign against the new religion. Her years of\r\nresidence at the French court, where religious interests were only too\r\noften sacrificed to political designs, could not fail to have produced\r\ntheir natural effect. In February 1561 she sent commissioners to\r\nassure the lords of her forgiveness for what they had done, and to\r\nempower the Duke of Châtelherault and others to convoke a Parliament\r\nin her name. At a meeting of the nobles held in January 1561 her\r\nnatural brother, Lord James Stuart, was deputed by the lords to offer\r\nMary their allegiance, while the Catholic party including the Earls of\r\nHuntly, Atholl, Crawford, Sutherland, and some bishops, dispatched a\r\nmessenger to warn her against the Congregation, and to place at her\r\ndisposal a strong force in case she decided to land in the north. But\r\nMary, distrusting the motives of Huntly and his friends, treated their\r\noffers of assistance with neglect, and welcomed as her saviour and\r\nfriend the man who even then was not unwilling to act as a spy on his\r\nsister and his queen at the bidding of Elizabeth. Mary's selection of\r\nhim as her trusted adviser boded ill for the future of her reign.\r\n\r\nAt last with a heavy heart Mary determined to leave the country of her\r\nadoption. As she was unwilling to confirm the treaty with England in\r\nits entirety and to renounce her claims to the English throne,\r\nElizabeth refused to grant passports through England, but under the\r\nshelter of a thick mist Mary succeeded in eluding all danger of\r\ncapture and landed safely at Leith (Aug. 1561). From the people\r\ngenerally she received an enthusiastic welcome, but, when on the\r\nfollowing Sunday she insisted that Mass should be celebrated in the\r\nprivate chapel of Holyrood, it required all the efforts of her brother\r\nto prevent a riot. Knox and his brethren denounced such idolatrous\r\nconduct as intolerable, and bewailed the misfortunes that God must\r\ninevitably pour out upon the country in punishment for so grievous a\r\ncrime. A few days later Mary issued a proclamation announcing that no\r\nchange would be made in the religious settlement without the consent\r\nof Parliament, but that in the meantime no attempt should be made to\r\ninterfere with her household. A new privy council was appointed, in\r\nwhich the two principal members were Lord James Stuart and Maitland,\r\nLord of Lethington, both equally untrustworthy. None of the Catholic\r\nbishops was offered a seat at the council board, and the Catholic\r\nlords were represented only by the Earls of Huntly and Argyll. A\r\ngeneral assembly of the Reformers was held at Edinburgh (1561), which\r\nsucceeded in securing a share of the ecclesiastical endowments, and\r\nanother in 1562, which appointed John Craig as the assistant of Knox\r\nin Edinburgh. For so far Mary could do little for her co-religionists\r\nin Scotland, nor indeed does it appear that any serious effort was\r\nmade in that direction. Still her own example was not without its\r\neffect. Several of the waverers especially in Edinburgh seem to have\r\nreturned to the Church. Pius IV., who was anxious to learn the true\r\nstate of affairs, commissioned the Jesuit Nicholas de Gouda (Goudanus)\r\nto visit Scotland for the purpose of encouraging the queen and of\r\ninviting the bishops to assist at the Council of Trent. He arrived in\r\nScotland (June 1561). After waiting six weeks in the house of a\r\nCatholic nobleman he secured a secret interview with the queen at\r\nHolyrood. With most of the bishops he was not even so successful.\r\nThough he reported that they were for the greater part Catholics and\r\nmen of good intentions, some of them like Sinclair of Ross refused to\r\nsee him, from others he got no reply to his letters, and it was only\r\nwith the greatest difficulty he contrived to have a short conversation\r\nwith Bishop Crichton at Dunkeld.[23] There is no doubt that the\r\nbishops were surrounded by powerful and watchful enemies, but it seems\r\nstrange that they should have effaced themselves so completely, at a\r\ntime when Knox and his opponents by means of general assemblies and\r\nother such bodies were impressing the country with their strength and\r\nactivity. Even though the bishops were silent the old religion was not\r\nwithout some able and energetic defenders in the person of Leslie,\r\nsoon to be the Bishop of Ross, Quintin Kennedy whose services have\r\nbeen referred to already, and Ninian Winzet, who caused Knox\r\nconsiderable embarrassment by his tracts, letters, and public\r\ndisputations.\r\n\r\nIn his report Father de Gouda alluded to the imminent peril in which\r\nthe queen stood owing to her complete reliance on her unworthy\r\nministers. Her brother Lord James Stuart, and Maitland, both hostile\r\nto the Catholic religion, were her principal advisers. Although the\r\nEarl of Huntly had not played a very noble part in the disputes\r\nbetween the regent and the Congregation, he was the recognised head of\r\nthe Catholic party. He had offered his services to the queen while she\r\nwas still in France, but at the instigation of her brother she had\r\nrefused to accept them. After her return to Scotland Huntly found that\r\nhe was treated with coldness, and the earldom of Moray that belonged\r\nto his family was taken from him and conferred on his old rival, Lord\r\nJames Stuart. During the queen's journey to the north (August 1562)\r\nshe refused to visit Huntly. A dispute having broken out regarding the\r\nexecution of one of his followers, who was unwilling to open the gates\r\nof a Gordon castle to the queen, Huntly took up arms. He was\r\noverthrown and slain at Corrichie by the Earl of Moray (1562). In a\r\nParliament held in May 1563 the Earls of Huntly and Sutherland and\r\neleven nobles of the house of Gordon were attainted, and their goods\r\nconfiscated. The overthrow of this nobleman, on whom the bishops had\r\ncounted for support, helped to strengthen the Congregation in\r\nScotland, and to encourage it to persecute more rigorously the\r\nfollowers of the old religion. During the spring of 1563 some of the\r\nCatholic clergy seem to have adopted a more forward policy, but they\r\nwere accused of violation of the law. The primate and close on fifty\r\nothers were tried before the courts in Edinburgh for celebrating or\r\nhearing Mass, and were committed to custody by the queen. To show that\r\nshe was still Catholic, however, Mary dispatched a letter to the\r\nCouncil of Trent. It was read to the assembled Fathers in May 1563,\r\nand it gave entire satisfaction if we may judge by the answer that was\r\nprepared. The papal legates were not unwilling that the council should\r\ndeclare sentence of excommunication against Queen Elizabeth, thereby\r\npreparing the way for Mary's claims to the throne, but the opposition\r\nof the Emperor and of Philip II. of Spain put an end to the\r\nscheme.[24]\r\n\r\nThe question of Mary's marriage was of paramount importance,\r\nparticularly as it was probable that the issue of the marriage would\r\nsucceed to the thrones of Scotland and of England. The Pope and the\r\nFrench favoured the Archduke Charles of Austria who was disliked by\r\nthe Scottish nobles as being too poor; Philip II., more for the\r\npurpose of defeating a proposed marriage of the Queen of Scotland to\r\nCharles IX. of France, suggested his own son Don Carlos as a probable\r\nsuitor, but he showed little real earnestness in pushing forward the\r\nproject, while Elizabeth was inclined to support her own former lover,\r\nDudley, who was created Earl of Leicester, as it is said, to prepare\r\nthe way for his marriage with the Scottish queen. But Mary, bewildered\r\nand annoyed by the varying counsels of her friends, put an end to the\r\nintrigues by marrying her cousin Lord Darnley, who as the son of the\r\nEarl of Lennox and of Margaret Douglas, granddaughter of Henry VII.,\r\nhad very strong claims on the English and Scottish thrones. A papal\r\ndispensation from the impediment of consanguinity was sought, but it\r\nwould appear that the marriage was solemnised (29th July 1565) before\r\nthe dispensation was granted.[25] Darnley was a young man of\r\nprepossessing appearance, and as a Catholic he was the idol of his\r\nco-religionists in England. His marriage with the Queen of Scotland\r\nwas agreeable to the Pope and to Philip II. of Spain, who hastened to\r\nsend Mary financial assistance as well as congratulations. Such a\r\nunion was, as might be expected, distasteful to the Protestant party\r\nin England, and particularly distasteful to Elizabeth, who foresaw the\r\ndisastrous consequences that might ensue to England from the union of\r\ntwo such formidable Catholic claimants to the English throne.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Moray and the other reforming lords, realising that the\r\nmarriage was likely to destroy their influence, determined to take up\r\narms. Encouraged by Elizabeth, the Earls of Moray, Glencairn, the Duke\r\nof Châtelherault and others rose in rebellion, nominally in defence of\r\nProtestantism but in reality to maintain their own supremacy at court.\r\nMary, displaying more courage than she had displayed hitherto,\r\nassembled her forces, overthrew the lords, and forced Moray and his\r\nconfederates to escape across the borders into England (Oct. 1565).\r\nThis victory gave new hopes to the Catholics in Scotland. Darnley\r\nbegan to attend Mass openly, as did several of the nobles, while the\r\nqueen took steps to secure appointments to some of the vacant\r\nbishoprics.\r\n\r\nBut soon a new danger appeared from an unexpected quarter. Darnley was\r\na vain and foolish youth who treated his wife with but scanty respect.\r\nHe wished to be sovereign of Scotland, to secure the crown for the\r\nfamily of Lennox to the exclusion of the Hamiltons, and to force the\r\nqueen to follow his counsels in all matters of state. As his wishes\r\nwere not granted he determined to revenge himself on Mary's secretary,\r\nDavid Riccio, whom he pretended to regard as Mary's secret adviser.\r\nFor this purpose he turned for assistance to the reformed party whose\r\nfears had been aroused by Mary's religious policy. A confederation was\r\nformed consisting of Darnley, the Earl of Morton, Lord Ruthven, and\r\nLindsay for the murder of Riccio. The Earl of Lennox Darnley's father,\r\nMoray, Argyll, and Maitland of Lethington, the English ambassador, and\r\napparently John Knox, were aware of the design and approved of it.[26]\r\nWhen everything was ready for the opening of Parliament the murderers\r\nforced their way into the presence of the queen, and slew her\r\nsecretary almost in her presence (9 March 1566). On the next day\r\nDarnley issued a proclamation ordering those who had assembled for the\r\nParliament to leave Edinburgh, and on the same evening the Earl of\r\nMoray arrived in the capital.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators had agreed to proclaim Darnley king of Scotland. For\r\nthis purpose the queen was to be held a prisoner or to be slain if she\r\nattempted to make her escape, but she succeeded in eluding the\r\nvigilance of her captors and in making her way to Dunbar, where she\r\nwas joined by Archbishop Hamilton, the Earls of Huntly, Atholl, and\r\nBothwell. She advanced on Edinburgh without meeting any resistance,\r\nwhile the murderers of Riccio were obliged to make their escape into\r\nEngland. Darnley deserted his fellow conspirators by communicating to\r\nthe queen the details of the plot. His desertion did not, however,\r\ngain him the dictatorship he desired, as Mary pardoned Moray and\r\nArgyll, and received them together with Huntly, Atholl, and Bothwell\r\ninto her councils. The birth of an heir to the throne would, it was\r\nthought, lead to a better understanding between Mary and her husband,\r\nbut unfortunately it had no result. Though the baptism of the prince\r\nwas carried out in the chapel-royal of Stirling Castle with all the\r\npomp and splendour of Catholic ceremonial (December 1566) Darnley\r\nrefused to be present or to take any part in the festivities. A few\r\ndays later Morton and the other murderers of Riccio were pardoned, and\r\nallowed to return to Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Earls of Moray and Argyll and the other leading conspirators were\r\nincensed against Darnley for having communicated to the queen their\r\nshare in the plot that led to Riccio's murder. Bothwell, who had done\r\nso much to frustrate the conspiracy, detested Darnley almost as\r\nfiercely as he himself was detested by both Darnley and the Earl of\r\nLennox. During the latter half of the year 1566 nearly all the great\r\nlords of Scotland entered into a confederation or \"band\" against\r\nDarnley. Whether they meant merely to assist the queen to procure a\r\nlegal separation from her husband with the support and approval of\r\nParliament, or whether they intended to bring about Darnley's death by\r\nlegal or illegal means is not sufficiently clear.[27]\r\n\r\nSoon after the baptism of the prince, Darnley fell ill in Glasgow of\r\nsmall-pox. The queen sent her physician to attend him, went herself to\r\nvisit him, and when he began to improve had him removed to a lonely\r\nhouse outside Edinburgh, where she frequently spent hours in his\r\ncompany. To all appearances a complete reconciliation had been\r\neffected, and Darnley in his letters expressed his entire satisfaction\r\nwith the kindness and attention of his wife. Suddenly on the night of\r\nthe 11th February 1567 the house was blown up, and Darnley was killed.\r\nSuspicion pointed to Bothwell as the author of the crime, and no doubt\r\nthe case against him was strong, though how far he was assisted and\r\nencouraged by some of the other lords must for ever remain a mystery.\r\nMary's concurrence or implication in the design is not proved by any\r\nreliable evidence, and were it not for her subsequent conduct it is\r\nnot likely that complicity in the murder of her husband would have\r\nbeen laid to her charge. At the privy council on the day following the\r\nmurder an explanation was drawn up and forwarded to France, declaring\r\nthat a plot against the lives of the queen, king, and principal nobles\r\nhad been discovered, and that it was only by a happy accident that the\r\nqueen's life had been saved.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Lennox, Darnley's father, charged Bothwell publicly with\r\nthe murder of the king and demanded that he should be brought to\r\njustice. A day was fixed for the trial, but as Bothwell was powerful\r\nin the councils of the queen and was both able and willing to resort\r\nto force if force were necessary, it was very difficult to procure\r\nevidence against him. Lennox pleaded unsuccessfully for a delay, and\r\nas no one was prepared to come forward to prove the charges, Bothwell\r\nwas acquitted (12th April 1567). A few days later most of the lords\r\nwho had assembled in Edinburgh for the meeting of Parliament met at\r\nAinslie's tavern and signed an agreement (Ainslie's Band) pledging\r\nthemselves before God to defend Bothwell who had been declared\r\ninnocent of the murder, and, stranger still, to procure his marriage\r\nwith the queen. Various and contradictory lists of the signatories\r\nhave been published, but from an examination of these different lists\r\nit is sufficiently clear that most of the great lords were attached to\r\nthe confederation.[28] As usually happened when a serious crisis was\r\napproaching, Moray was absent from the country.\r\n\r\nBothwell, under pretence of punishing some of the robber bands,\r\nmustered his forces, overcame the small guard that accompanied the\r\nqueen on her journey from Stirling to Edinburgh, and carried off\r\nherself and Maitland as prisoners to Dunbar (19 April). That Bothwell\r\nacted in collusion with Mary is not proved, but despite the advice of\r\nher confessor, of the French representative, and of her best friends\r\nMary agreed to go through a form of marriage with Bothwell. Her new\r\nhusband was a Protestant, married already to the Earl of Huntly's\r\nsister from whom he had obtained a separation. The marriage ceremony\r\nwas performed by the apostate Bishop of the Orkneys, who was soon to\r\nprove as disloyal to his queen as he had proved dishonest towards the\r\nPope. Such a marriage celebrated under such circumstances created a\r\nmost painful impression amongst the Catholics at home as well as in\r\nFrance and at Rome. It served to confirm their worst suspicions, and\r\nmade them fear that Mary was about to desert the religion of her\r\nfathers. \"With this act,\" wrote the papal ambassador who had been\r\ndeputed to come to Scotland but who remained at Paris, \"so\r\ndishonourable to herself, the propriety of sending any sort of envoy\r\nceases unless indeed her Majesty, in order to amend her error and\r\ninspired by God, convert the Earl to the Catholic faith.\"[29]\r\n\r\nMany of the lords, who had signed the bond to promote the marriage of\r\nBothwell and Mary, professed to be shocked when they learned that the\r\nmarriage had taken place. Relying upon the active intervention of\r\nElizabeth they took up arms to avenge the murder of their king. The\r\narmies of the queen and of the lords met at Carbery Hill, where after\r\nsome discussion Mary surrendered herself to the lords, and Bothwell\r\nwas allowed to make his escape. The queen surrendered on the\r\nunderstanding that she was to be treated as queen, but she soon\r\ndiscovered that her captors intended to deprive her of her kingdom and\r\npossibly of her life. As a first step in the proceedings she was\r\nremoved from Holyrood to Loch Leven (16th June). A document was drawn\r\nup embodying her abdication of the Scottish throne in favour of her\r\ninfant son, and the appointment of her brother the Earl of Moray as\r\nregent during the minority. Until Moray's return the government was to\r\nbe entrusted to a commission consisting of the Duke of Châtelherault,\r\nLennox, Argyll, Atholl, Morton, Glencairn and Moray. Lord Lindsay and\r\nSir Robert Melville were deputed to obtain the queen's signature,\r\nwhich they succeeded in obtaining only by threats and violence (24th\r\nJuly 1567). The young prince was crowned a few days later, John Knox\r\nacting as preacher on the occasion, and the apostate Bishop of the\r\nOrkneys as the chief minister. Steps were taken to ensure that Mary\r\nshould not make her escape from imprisonment, and Bothwell who had\r\nfled to the Orkneys was forced to escape to Denmark, where he died in\r\n1578. Moray hastened back from France, interviewed the queen at Loch\r\nLeven, accepted the office to which he had been appointed, and was\r\nproclaimed regent in Scotland. Severe measures were taken against the\r\nCatholic clergy many of whom fled from the kingdom. The queen's chapel\r\nat Holyrood was destroyed, and care was taken that the young king\r\nshould be reared in the Protestant religion.\r\n\r\nThe lords of Scotland had taken up arms to avenge the murder of\r\nDarnley, but once they established themselves in power they took no\r\nsteps to bring the murderers to justice, for the obvious reason that\r\nany judicial investigation must necessarily result in establishing\r\ntheir own guilt. Sir James Balfour, who had been involved deeply in\r\nthe affair, was forgiven, on condition that he should surrender\r\nEdinburgh Castle into the hands of the regent. Parliament met in\r\nDecember 1567. It confirmed the abdication of the queen and the\r\nappointment of Moray. The laws passed against the Catholic Church in\r\n1560 were renewed. It was enacted furthermore that for the future the\r\nkings and rulers of Scotland should swear to uphold the reformed\r\nreligion and to extirpate heresy. The queen had demanded that she\r\nshould be allowed to defend herself before Parliament against the\r\nattacks of her enemies, but the regent and council refused to comply\r\nwith her request. Some of her friends, however, endeavoured to uphold\r\nher good name, and when they were defeated in Parliament they appealed\r\nto the people by publishing a defence of their sovereign.\r\n\r\nThough every precaution was taken to ensure the safe-keeping of the\r\nqueen, she succeeded in escaping from Loch Leven (2 May 1568). She was\r\nwelcomed at Dunbar by the Primate of Scotland, the Hamiltons, Huntly,\r\nArgyll, Seaton, Cassillis, and others, and soon found herself at the\r\nhead of an army of eight thousand men. She declared that her\r\nabdication having been secured by violence was worthless, and that the\r\nacts of the recent Parliament were null and void. She called upon all\r\nher loyal subjects to flock to her standard. The regent, aware that\r\nunless a sudden blow could be struck help would come to Mary from the\r\nCatholics of the north as well as from France and Spain, determined to\r\ntake the field at once. The armies met at Langside, near Glasgow (13th\r\nMay), where the forces of the queen were overthrown. Mary accompanied\r\nby a few faithful followers made her way south towards Galloway, and\r\nat last against the advice of her best friends she determined to cross\r\nthe border to throw herself on the protection of the Queen of England.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Mary in England created a great difficulty for\r\nElizabeth. If she were allowed to escape to France, both France and\r\nSpain might join hands to enforce her claims to the English\r\nsuccession, and if she were restored to the throne of Scotland, Moray\r\nand his friends could expect no mercy. It was determined, therefore,\r\nthat Elizabeth should act as umpire between the queen and her\r\nrebellious subjects, so that by inducing both sides to submit their\r\ngrievances to Elizabeth feeling between them might be embittered, and\r\nthat in the meantime a divided Scotland might be kept in bondage. In\r\nher reply to the letter received from the Queen of Scotland Elizabeth\r\ninformed her that she could not be received at court nor could any\r\nhelp be given to her unless she had cleared herself of the charges\r\nbrought against her. Both parties in Scotland were commanded to cease\r\nhostilities, but at the same time Cecil took care to inform Moray\r\nsecretly that he should take steps to enforce his authority throughout\r\nScotland.[30]\r\n\r\nMary, while repudiating Elizabeth's right to sit in judgment on her\r\nconduct, consented that a conference should be held between her\r\ncommissioners and those appointed by Elizabeth and by the rebel lords.\r\nThe Dukes of Norfolk, Sussex, and Sir Ralph Sadler were the English\r\ncommissioners; Bishop Leslie, Lord Livingstone, and Lord Herries\r\nrepresented Mary; while Moray, Morton, and Maitland of Lethington\r\nappeared to present the case of the rebel lords. The conference opened\r\nat York (October 1568). Several days were wasted in attempts made by\r\nMaitland to effect a compromise so that the production of charges and\r\ncounter-charges might be unnecessary, and in considering inquiries put\r\nforward by the Earl of Moray regarding Elizabeth's attitude in case\r\nthe charges against the Scottish queen were proved. Some of the\r\nletters supposed to have been written by Mary to Bothwell were shown\r\nsecretly to the English commissioners, but they do not seem to have\r\nproduced any great effect on the Duke of Norfolk or even on the Duke\r\nof Sussex who was certainly not prejudiced in Mary's favour. The\r\nlatter reported that Moray could produce no proofs except certain\r\nletters the authorship of which the Queen of Scots would deny. In\r\nfact, Sussex believed that were the affair to come to trial it would\r\ngo hard with the queen's accusers.[31] In a short time Elizabeth\r\nordered that the venue should be changed from York to London, and\r\nMary, believing that she would be allowed an opportunity to defend\r\nherself before the peers and representatives of foreign governments,\r\naccepted the change. She sent Bishop Leslie and Lord Herries to\r\nrepresent her in London, but on their arrival they found that Mary\r\nwould not be allowed to appear in person, though her accusers were\r\nreceived by the queen, nor would the foreign ambassadors be admitted\r\nto hear the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe new commission opened at Westminster (4th Dec. 1568). The lords\r\nbrought forward their charges against the queen accusing her of\r\ncomplicity in the murder of her husband. In proof of this they\r\nproduced a number of letters that were supposed to have been contained\r\nin a casket left behind him by Bothwell in Edinburgh, when he fled\r\nfrom that city in June 1567. This casket contained eight letters and\r\nsome sonnets, which, if really written by Mary, proved beyond doubt\r\nthat she was hand in glove with Bothwell in bringing about the murder\r\nof Darnley. The Casket Letters considered in the light of her own\r\nconduct furnished damaging evidence of Mary's guilt. Whether these\r\nletters were genuine or forged is never likely to be established with\r\ncertainty,[32] but considering the character of Mary's opponents,\r\ntheir well-known genius for duplicity, the contradictory statements\r\nput forward by their witnesses and the indecent haste with which the\r\nwhole enquiry was brought to a close, it is difficult to believe that\r\nthe evidence of Mary's authorship was convincing. The commissioners\r\nacting on Mary's behalf laboured under grave disadvantages from the\r\nfact that their mistress was not at hand for consultation. As a\r\nconsequence they made many mistakes in their pleadings, but they were\r\non sure ground when they demanded that copies of the incriminating\r\nletters should be forwarded to Mary for examination. This demand,\r\nthough supported by the French ambassador, was refused, and Mary was\r\nnever allowed an opportunity to reply to the main charge brought\r\nagainst her. An offer was made that proceedings should be dropped if\r\nMary would consent to resign the throne of Scotland in favour of her\r\nson, and when she refused this offer the conference was brought to a\r\nsudden termination. Moray and his friends were informed that \"nothing\r\nhad been produced against them as yet that might impair their honour\r\nand allegiance; and on the other part there had been nothing\r\nsufficiently produced or shown by them against the queen their\r\nsovereign, whereby the Queen of England should conceive or take any\r\nevil opinion of the queen her good sister for anything yet seen\" (Jan.\r\n1569).[33] The Earl of Moray and his companions were allowed to return\r\nto Scotland, and nothing more was done either to establish the\r\ninnocence or the guilt of the Queen of Scotland. The object of\r\nElizabeth and her advisers had been attained. They had blackened the\r\ncharacter of Mary; they had driven a wedge between herself and her\r\nnobles, and had allowed Moray to return to Scotland to rule as an\r\nEnglish dependent.\r\n\r\nTo prevent Queen Mary from falling into the hands of the Catholic\r\nlords of the north she was removed from Tutbury to Coventry (26th\r\nJanuary 1569). Whatever might be said of Mary's conduct during her\r\nearly years in Scotland, or whatever doubt might have been entertained\r\nabout her orthodoxy by the Pope and by the Catholic powers of the\r\nContinent, everything unfavourable to her was forgotten by them in\r\ntheir sympathy for her sufferings, and in their admiration for her\r\nfortitude and sincere attachment to her religion. Pius V. and Philip\r\nII. were as deeply interested in her fate as were the Catholics of\r\nScotland and of England. A scheme was arranged to promote her marriage\r\nto the Duke of Norfolk and to secure her succession to the English\r\nthrone, but Elizabeth anticipated the design by imprisoning the Duke,\r\nsuppressing the rebellion of the northern lords (1569), and by braving\r\nthe terrors of the papal excommunication levelled against her the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nWhen later on a new plot was discovered with the same object in view\r\nNorfolk was put to death (1572). While Mary was alive in England she\r\nwas a source of constant danger to Elizabeth's throne. English\r\nCatholics driven to desperation by the penal laws were certain to turn\r\nto her as their lawful sovereign, while the Catholic nations on the\r\nContinent could fall back on the imprisoned queen whenever they chose\r\nto stir up disorder, or possibly to attempt an invasion. Dangerous as\r\nshe was in prison, she might be still more dangerous if she were free\r\nto effect her escape either to Scotland or to France. In her death lay\r\nElizabeth's best hope of peace, and as the rigour of her confinement\r\nfailed to kill her, an attempt was made to induce the Scots to\r\nundertake a work that the English feared to undertake.[34] At last an\r\nopportunity was given of bringing about her execution and of covering\r\nthe measure with an appearance of legality. A scheme for her release\r\nwas undertaken by Babington,[35] with every detail of which the spies\r\nof Cecil were intimately acquainted, if they did not actually help to\r\narrange them. Babington's letters to Mary and her replies were\r\nbetrayed and copied. It is certain that Mary knew what was intended,\r\nbut there is no evidence to show that she approved of the murder of\r\nElizabeth. When the proper time came Babington and his accomplices\r\nwere arrested and put to death (October 1586), and Mary's fate was\r\nsubmitted to the decision of Parliament. Both houses petitioned that\r\nthe Queen of Scotland should be executed, but Elizabeth, fearful of\r\nthe consequences and hoping that Mary's jailer Paulet, would relieve\r\nher of the responsibility, hesitated to sign the death warrant. At\r\nlast, however, she overcame her scruples, and on the 8th February\r\n1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded at Fotheringay. Her attitude to\r\nthe last was worthy of praise. She died a martyr for her religion, and\r\nby her death she expiated fully the imprudences and waverings of her\r\nyouth. Elizabeth pretended to be horrified by the action of her\r\nministers. Her secretary was imprisoned and fined to prove to\r\nScotland, France, and Spain that the Queen of England had no\r\nresponsibility for the tragedy of Fotheringay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile how fared it with Catholicism in Scotland? The Regent Moray\r\nreturned from England early in 1569. Acting on the repeated requests\r\nof the General Assembly he undertook new measures against the Catholic\r\nChurch. Catholic officials and professors were removed from Aberdeen\r\nUniversity; several priests were arrested and punished though the\r\nregent was unwilling to inflict the death penalty, and many\r\ndistinguished clerics and laymen, including the Primate and Bishop\r\nLeslie, were outlawed and their goods confiscated. The regent was not\r\ndestined however to enjoy long the fruits of his treachery against his\r\nsister. In 1570, at the very time when he was plotting with the\r\nEnglish government to get the Queen of Scotland into his power, he was\r\nshot in Linlithgow by one of the Hamiltons, the hereditary enemies of\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\nOn his death there were two strong parties in Scotland. The majority\r\nof the nobles, including the Duke of Châtelherault, Argyll, Huntly,\r\nAtholl, and even Kirkcaldy and Maitland of Lethington, two former\r\nsupporters of Moray, ranged themselves on the side of their imprisoned\r\nqueen, and might have succeeded in re-establishing her authority had\r\nnot Elizabeth espoused the cause of Morton, Mar, Glencairn and\r\nRuthven, backed as these were by Knox and the preachers. Two English\r\narmies were dispatched into Scotland, and with the help of the English\r\nforces the Earl of Lennox, Darnley's father, was appointed regent\r\n(July 1570). It was not the first time that he had sought to destroy\r\nthe independence of his country by invoking the assistance of the\r\nEnglish, and as he had gone over to Protestantism he was determined to\r\nthrow himself into the arms of the Reformers. The castle of Dunbarton\r\nwas still in the possession of the queen's supporters. He laid siege\r\nto it, and captured it in April 1571. Here he seized the Primate of\r\nScotland, and had him put to death after a summary trial. The chapter\r\nmet and elected Robert Hay, but he was never consecrated, and for more\r\nthan three hundred years St. Andrew's was without a Catholic bishop.\r\nIn September 1571 Lennox was slain, and the Earl of Mar was elected\r\nregent. During his short reign he was unable to enforce his authority\r\nin the country. Negotiations were opened with him by Cecil's agents to\r\ninduce him to undertake the execution of the Queen of Scotland, who\r\nwas to be sent back from England for the purpose, but his sudden death\r\nin 1572 put an end to the scheme.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by the Earl of Morton, another of Elizabeth's agents.\r\nAt first Morton was not unfavourable to the Catholics owing to the\r\ndisputes that arose between himself and the preachers about the\r\nre-establishment of the episcopal form of government, but later on he\r\nadopted a policy of violent opposition to the old religion. Some of\r\nthe priests were put to death; others were arrested or banished; a\r\nlist of Catholics including Beaton the Archbishop of Glasgow, Leslie\r\nBishop of Ross, and Chisholm Bishop of Dunblane was drawn up for\r\nproscription, and steps were taken to suppress Catholic holidays and\r\nto remove from the churches everything that called to mind Catholic\r\ndevotions.\r\n\r\nIn 1578 the young king demanded Morton's resignation. A council of\r\ntwelve was appointed in his place, at the head of which stood the\r\nEarls of Argyll and Atholl. Elizabeth was annoyed at the fall of her\r\nminion, and took no pains to conceal her annoyance from the young\r\nking. It looked as if friendly relations between the two courts might\r\nbe broken, and the Catholic party both at home and on the Continent\r\nwere filled with new hopes. In 1579 Esmé Stuart, Lord d'Aubigny, a\r\nnephew of the former Earl of Lennox, arrived from France, where he had\r\nbeen educated as a Catholic. He was welcomed at court by the king and\r\ncreated Earl of Lennox. James fell completely under his sway, though\r\nthe preachers regarded d'Aubigny as a Catholic spy. Regardless of\r\nElizabeth's friendship, James was induced to open communications with\r\nhis mother, and when the Earl of Morton rose in rebellion against such\r\na policy he was arrested and put to death (1582). Though apparently\r\nLennox made profession of accepting the established religion in\r\nScotland, he was endeavouring secretly to bring about an understanding\r\nbetween Mary and her son, to secure the release of the former from\r\ncaptivity, and to assist the Catholic cause. The preachers took alarm\r\nat the sudden and unexpected increase of Popery. \"Before this French\r\ncourt came to Scotland,\" said Walter Belcanqual in one of his sermons\r\nin 1580 \"there were either few or none that durst avow themselves\r\nPapists, neither yet publicly in the country, neither in the reformed\r\ncities, neither in the king's palace. But since that time, not only\r\nbegin the Papists within the realm to lift up their heads, but also\r\nour Scottish Papists that were outside the realm swarm home from all\r\nplaces like locusts, and have taken such hardihood unto them that not\r\nonly have they access to the French court, but also in the king's\r\npalace, in the particular sessions of our kirks, and general\r\nassemblies thereof, durst plainly avow their Papistry, and impugn the\r\ntruth, both against the laws of the realm and discipline of the\r\nChurch, contrary to all practice that we have had before.\"[36]\r\n\r\nThe members of the General Assembly, annoyed at the attempt of the\r\nking to support the episcopal system of government, were determined to\r\nremove Lennox, whom they regarded as an emissary of Rome. Elizabeth's\r\nagents, too, were busy stirring up discontent. A plot formed by\r\nRuthven Earl of Gowrie, the Earl of Mar, and others, for the capture\r\nof the king, was carried out successfully during a visit paid by James\r\nto Ruthven's castle at Gowrie (The Gowrie Plot). He was seized and\r\nlodged safely in Stirling. The Earl of Arran who attempted to rescue\r\nhis sovereign was made prisoner, and Lennox was obliged to flee to\r\nFrance (1582).\r\n\r\nFor a time Melville and the preachers, who gloried in Gowrie's\r\nsuccessful machinations, held the king in bondage. The General\r\nAssembly of 1582 expressed its approval of what had been done,[37] and\r\nrenewed its attacks upon the episcopal system. James, however,\r\nsucceeded in making his escape from confinement; the Earl of Arran was\r\nrecalled to court; Ruthven was declared a traitor and was beheaded,\r\nand the other conspirators were obliged to make their escape to\r\nEngland. James entered into close correspondence with some of the\r\nCatholic powers abroad, and even went so far as to appeal to the Pope\r\nfor assistance against the enemies who surrounded him (1584). For a\r\ntime it seemed as if a great Catholic reaction was about to set in.\r\nPriests who had escaped from England were labouring with success in\r\nthe Scottish mission-fields; a few Jesuits had arrived from the\r\nContinent, and France, Spain, and the Pope were in correspondence\r\nregarding the assistance that might be given to James and his mother.\r\nBut the spies of Elizabeth soon obtained knowledge of what was in\r\ncontemplation. France and Spain were too jealous of one another to\r\nundertake an armed expedition, without which success was impossible.\r\nNegotiations were opened up with a view of detaching James from the\r\nCatholic party, and of inspiring him with distrust for his mother. As\r\nhe was always more anxious to secure his accession to the English\r\nthrone than to defend either his mother's life or her religion, he\r\nsuccumbed completely to English influence.\r\n\r\nNot even the execution of his mother in 1587 was sufficient to rouse\r\nhim to take serious action. Though he was urged by many of the\r\nScottish nobles to declare war he contented himself with angry\r\nspeeches and protests that passed unheeded. Even many of the\r\nPresbyterian lords were ready to support him had he declared war, and\r\nCatholic noblemen like the Earls of Huntly, Erroll, and Crawford, Lord\r\nMaxwell, and Lord Hamilton, offered their assistance. It was well-\r\nknown, too, that Philip II. was preparing at the time for an invasion\r\nof England. Had Scotland declared war the results might have been\r\ndisastrous for England, but James, instead of taking the offensive,\r\naccepted a pension from Elizabeth and offered to assist in the defence\r\nof the kingdom. He endeavoured at first to conciliate the Catholic\r\nparty by restoring John Leslie Bishop of Ross, who had been for years\r\na most zealous defender of Mary Queen of Scots, to his See and his\r\npossessions, and by appointing the exiled Archbishop of Glasgow to be\r\nhis ambassador at the French court. The General Assemblies, however,\r\nbacked up by Elizabeth forced him to take strong measures against the\r\nadherents of the old religion. In 1593 a proclamation was issued\r\nordering all Jesuits and seminary priests to leave Edinburgh within\r\ntwo hours under pain of death, and a violent campaign was begun in\r\nnearly every part of Scotland against the Catholic nobles and clergy.\r\nThe Catholic lords who were in close communication with Spain were\r\nforced to take up arms. Their forces were mustered under the Earls of\r\nHuntly and Erroll, and gained a complete victory at Glenlivet over the\r\nEarl of Argyll who was dispatched against them. When the news of this\r\ndefeat reached the king at Dundee he displayed unwonted activity. He\r\nassembled a large army to punish his rebellious subjects, and the\r\nCatholic lords were at last forced to make their escape from the\r\ncountry. With the flight of Huntly and Erroll (1595) and the dispersal\r\nof their troops the triumph of Protestantism in Scotland was assured.\r\n\r\nThe great leader in the attack on the Catholic Church in Scotland was\r\nJohn Knox who belonged to the Geneva school, and who worked hard for\r\nthe introduction of the Calvinist system of Church government. The\r\nstate of affairs in Scotland at the time was very favourable to his\r\ndesigns. Obviously there could be no question of royal supremacy or of\r\na State Church being established after the English model, since the\r\nQueen of Scotland was a staunch supporter of the Roman Church. Neither\r\ncould the principle of parliamentary control be accepted since the\r\nScottish Parliament was comparatively powerless. Had the revenues and\r\npossessions of the Scottish bishoprics and ecclesiastical benefices\r\nbeen left untouched the democratic form of government would have been\r\nimpossible, but as the hungry lords of Scotland had appropriated\r\nalready the wealth of the Church they had no special interest in the\r\necclesiastical appointments. The result was that the General\r\nAssemblies, composed of both preachers and laymen, became the\r\nrecognised governing body of the new religion, and they arrogated to\r\nthemselves full control of ecclesiastical affairs. The bishops who\r\nwere willing to conform were not, however, removed from office. They\r\nwere subjected to the control of the General Assembly, and were placed\r\non the same level as the recently named superintendents.\r\n\r\nBut the regents who governed Scotland during the minority of James VI.\r\nwere not inclined to receive with favour the idea of ecclesiastical\r\nindependence. In 1571 the Earl of Mar insisted on appointing an\r\narchbishop to St. Andrew's without reference to the General Assembly,\r\nand immediately the preachers were up in arms. They were handicapped\r\nin their resistance by the fact that their great leader Knox was too\r\nill to afford them much assistance, and at last they were forced to\r\naccept a compromise according to which the old system of\r\necclesiastical government was left practically untouched. Archbishops,\r\nbishops, deans and chapters were retained; the bishops were to be\r\nelected by the chapters with the permission and approval of the king\r\nand were to receive the temporalities by royal grant; and all persons\r\nadmitted to benefices were to promise obedience to their bishops. At\r\nthe same time it was agreed that the bishops should be subject to the\r\nGeneral Assemblies in spiritual matters, as they were subject to the\r\nking in temporals. It was hoped that by means of this compromise peace\r\nmight be secured, but in a short time the attack on episcopal\r\ngovernment was renewed with still greater vigour. A new leader had\r\nappeared in the person of Andrew Melville, the Principal of the\r\nCollege of Glasgow, and the friend of the great Swiss Reformer, Beza.\r\nDespite the fact that the regent espoused the cause of episcopacy the\r\nGeneral Assemblies were determined to continue the struggle for its\r\noverthrow. The adoption in 1580 of the /Second Book of Discipline/,\r\ninvolving as it did the overthrow of episcopal authority, the\r\nrejection of state interference and the assertion that spiritual\r\nauthority was derived only from the people, was a severe blow to the\r\nyoung king and his advisers; but they found some consolation in the\r\nfact that the Scottish Parliament re-asserted the principle of royal\r\nsupremacy and recognised the authority of the bishops (1584).\r\n\r\nA form of declaration was drawn up which all preachers were required\r\nto sign under threat of dismissal. During the years 1585 and 1586\r\nserious attempts were made by the government to reduce them to\r\nsubjection, but without any important result. In fact, at the\r\nsuggestion of Melville, the General Assembly pronounced sentence of\r\nexcommunication against Archbishop Adamson (1586), and the archbishop\r\nwas obliged to submit himself to the judgment of that body. From that\r\ntime things went from bad to worse till in 1592 Parliament gave its\r\nformal sanction to Presbyterianism, though the /Second Book of\r\nDiscipline/ was not approved, nor were the bishops deprived of their\r\ncivil positions. Hardly had James been seated on the English throne\r\nthan he determined to make another effort to force episcopacy and\r\nroyal supremacy on the Scottish Church. He appointed several new\r\nbishops to the vacant Sees (1603). As the preachers still offered a\r\nstrong opposition Melville was invited to a conference at Hampton\r\nCourt (1606) where a warm debate took place between the\r\nrepresentatives of the Presbyterians and their opponents. Melville and\r\nhis friends refused to yield, and when the former was summoned to\r\nappear before the privy council to answer for certain verses he had\r\ncomposed, he seized the Archbishop of Canterbury by the sleeves of his\r\nrochet, denounced him as an enemy of the gospel truth, and assured him\r\nthat he would oppose his schemes to the last drop of blood. He was\r\narrested and thrown into prison. Parliament supported the king (1609);\r\na High Commission Court was established in 1610 to deal with the\r\npreachers, and in the same year the nominees of James were consecrated\r\nby English prelates. But despite the efforts of James and of his\r\nsuccessor Charles I., Presbyterianism still continued to flourish in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThough the flight of the Earls of Huntly and Erroll (1595) had assured\r\nthe triumph of Presbyterianism many of the people of Scotland,\r\nparticularly of those in the north, still remained devoted to the old\r\nreligion. The Jesuit Fathers had been untiring in their efforts, and\r\nthe labours of men like Fathers Creighton, Hay, Gordon, and Abercromby\r\nwere far from being unfruitful. Still the ecclesiastical organisation\r\nhad broken down; the supply of priests was likely to become exhausted,\r\nand, unless some attempt was made to maintain unity and authority, as\r\nwell as provide means of education for clerical students, there was\r\ngrave danger that Catholicism might soon be extinguished. In 1598\r\nGeorge Blackwell received faculties as archpriest or superior of the\r\nScotch mission, and was provided with a number of consultors to assist\r\nhim in his difficult task. A Scotch college was established at Rome by\r\nClement VIII. to supply Scotland with priests (1600). Another college\r\nof a similar kind was founded at Tournai in 1576 by Dr. James Cheyne.\r\nLater on it was removed to Pont-à-Mousson and placed under the control\r\nof the Jesuits, and finally it was brought to Douay. The old Irish\r\nfoundations at Würzburg and Regensburg were taken over by the Scotch,\r\nand utilised for the education of priests. Scottish colleges were also\r\nestablished at Paris and at Madrid (transferred to Valladolid).\r\n\r\nThe Catholics of Scotland expected some toleration from James I., but\r\nthey were doomed to disappointment. The king was unable and unwilling\r\nto put an end to the violent persecution carried on by the kirk, which\r\naimed at wiping out every trace of Catholicity by directing its\r\nattackings against the Catholic nobility of the north and against the\r\nJesuits, one of whom, Father Ogilvie was put to death (1516).\r\nSimilarly under Charles I. the persecution continued unabated, but,\r\nnotwithstanding all the penalties levelled against the clergy, many\r\npriests were found willing and ready to help their co-religionists in\r\nScotland. Jesuits, Benedictines, Franciscans from Ireland, Capuchins,\r\nand Vincentians[38] vied with each other in their efforts to confirm\r\nthe faith of those who remained true and to win back those who had\r\nfallen away. During the Protectorate the Catholics could hope for no\r\nmercy, nor did the accession of Charles II. make much change in their\r\nsad condition. Under James II. they enjoyed a brief spell of liberty.\r\nThe chapel at Holyrood was opened once again, and some provision was\r\nmade from the private resources of the king for the support of the\r\nmissions, and of the foreign colleges.\r\n\r\nBut the favour of James II. led to still greater persecutions once he\r\nhad been overthrown to make way for William of Orange. During the\r\nreigns of William and Mary, of Anne and of George I. the position of\r\nthe Scotch Catholics was even worse than that of their brethren in\r\nEngland or Ireland. In his anxiety to encourage both the priests and\r\nthe laity Innocent XII. appointed Bishop Thomas Nicholson as vicar-\r\napostolic of Scotland in 1694, and, as it was impossible for him to\r\ngive sufficient attention to the districts in the north and west where\r\nCatholics were still fairly numerous, Dr. Hugh MacDonald was appointed\r\nvicar-apostolic of the Highlands in 1726. When the Pretender arrived\r\nin Scotland the Catholics flocked to his standard, and when he was\r\ndefeated at Culloden (1746) they were obliged to pay a heavy penalty\r\nfor their loyalty to the old rulers. The Highland clans were either\r\ncut up in battle or deported; the Catholic chapels were closed, and so\r\nviolent was the persecution that ensued that it seemed as if the\r\nwishes of the kirk were about to be realised. But events soon showed\r\nthat those who imagined they had seen the extinction of Catholicism in\r\nScotland were doomed to disappointment.\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] Theiner, /Vet. Mon.

Wilson, /The Beginnings of\r\n  Modern Ireland/, 1912.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the fourteenth century English power in Ireland\r\nwas on the decline. The Irish princes, driven to desperation by the\r\nexactions and cruelties of the officials, adopted generally a more\r\nhostile attitude, while the great Norman nobles, who had obtained\r\ngrants of land in various parts of Ireland, began to intermarry with\r\nthe Irish, adopted their language, their laws, their dress, and their\r\ncustoms, and for all practical purposes renounced their allegiance to\r\nthe sovereign of England.\r\n\r\nOwing to the civil war that raged in England during the latter portion\r\nof the fifteenth century the English colonists were left entirely\r\nwithout support, and being divided among themselves, the Geraldines\r\nfavouring the House of York, and the Ormonds, the House of Lancaster,\r\nthey were almost powerless to resist the encroachments of the native\r\nprinces. Nor did the accession of Henry VII. lead to a combined effort\r\nfor the restoration of English authority. The welcome given by so many\r\nof the Anglo-Irish, both laymen and clerics, to the two pretenders,\r\nSimnel and Warbeck, and the efforts the king was obliged to make to\r\ndefend his throne against these claimants, made it impossible for him\r\nto undertake the conquest of the country. As a result, the sphere of\r\nEnglish influence in Ireland, or the Pale, as it was called, became\r\ngradually more restricted. The frantic efforts made by the Parliament\r\nheld at Drogheda (1494, Poynings' Parliament) to protect the English\r\nterritory from invasion by the erection \"of a double ditch six feet\r\nhigh\" is the best evidence that the conquest of the country still\r\nawaited completion.[1] In the early years of the reign of Henry VIII.\r\nthe Pale embraced only portions of the present counties of Dublin,\r\nLouth, Meath and Kildare, or to be more accurate, it was bounded by a\r\nline drawn from Dundalk through Ardee, Kells, Kilcock, Clane, Naas,\r\nKilcullen, Ballymore-Eustace, Rathcoole, Tallaght, and Dalkey. Within\r\nthis limited area the inhabitants were not safe from invasion and\r\nspoliation unless they agreed to purchase their security by the\r\npayment of an annual tribute to the neighbouring Irish princes; and\r\noutside it, even in the cities held by Norman settlers and in the\r\nterritories owned by Norman barons, the king's writ did not run.[2]\r\n\r\nRecourse was had to legislative measures to preserve the English\r\ncolonists from being merged completely into the native population.\r\nAccording to the Statutes of Kilkenny (1367) the colonists were\r\nforbidden to intermarry with the Irish, to adopt their language,\r\ndress, or customs, or to hold any business relations with them, and\r\nwhat was worse, the line of division was to be recognised even within\r\nthe sanctuary. No Irishman was to be admitted into cathedral or\r\ncollegiate chapters or into any benefice situated in English\r\nterritory, and religious houses were warned against admitting any\r\nIrish novices, although they were quite free to accept English\r\nsubjects born in Ireland[3] (1367). This statute did not represent a\r\nchange of policy in regard to Irish ecclesiastics. From the very\r\nbeginning of the Norman attempt at colonisation the relations between\r\nthe two bodies of ecclesiastics had been very strained. Thus, in the\r\nyear 1217 Henry III. wrote to his Justiciary in Ireland calling his\r\nattention to the fact that the election of Irishmen to episcopal Sees\r\nhad caused already considerable trouble, and that consequently, care\r\nshould be taken in future that none but Englishmen should be elected\r\nor promoted to cathedral chapters. The Irish clerics objected strongly\r\nto such a policy of exclusion, and carried their remonstrances to\r\nHonorius III. who declared on two occasions (1220, 1224) that this\r\niniquitous decree was null and void.[4] As the papal condemnations did\r\nnot produce the desired effect, the archbishops, bishops, and chapters\r\nseem to have taken steps to protect themselves against aggression by\r\nordaining that no Englishman should be admitted into the cathedral\r\nchapters, but Innocent IV., following the example of Honorius III.,\r\ncondemned this measure.[5]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its solemn condemnation by the Holy See this policy of\r\nexclusion was carried out by both parties, and the line of division\r\nbecame more marked according as the English power began to decline.\r\nThe petition addressed to John XXII. (1317) by the Irish chieftains\r\nwho supported the invasion of Bruce bears witness to the fact that the\r\nStatutes of Kilkenny did not constitute an innovation, and more than\r\nonce during the fifteenth century the legislation against Irish\r\necclesiastics was renewed. The permission given to the Archbishop of\r\nDublin to confer benefices situated in the Irish districts of his\r\ndiocese on Irish clerics (1485, 1493) serves only to emphasise the\r\ngeneral trend of policy.[6] Similarly the action of the Dominican\r\nauthorities in allowing two superiors in Ireland, one of the houses in\r\nthe English Pale, the other for the houses in the territories of the\r\nIrish princes[7] (1484), the refusal of the Irish Cistercians to\r\nacknowledge the jurisdiction of their English superiors, the boast of\r\nWalter Wellesley, Bishop of Kildare and prior of the monastery of Old\r\nConnal (1539) that no Irishman had been admitted into this institution\r\nsince the day of its foundation,[8] prove clearly enough that the\r\nrelations between the Irish and English ecclesiastics during the\r\nfifteenth century were far from being harmonious.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, as has been shown, the Holy See interfered to\r\nexpress its disapproval of the policy of exclusion whether adopted by\r\nthe Normans or the Irish, but later on, when it was found that a\r\nreconciliation was impossible, the Pope deemed it the lesser of two\r\nevils to allow both parties to live apart. Hence the Norman community\r\nof Galway was permitted to separate itself from the Irish population\r\nimmediately adjoining, and to be governed in spirituals by its own\r\nwarden (1484); and Leo X. approved of the demand made by the chapter\r\nof St. Patrick's, Dublin, that no Irishman should be appointed a canon\r\nof that church (1515).[9] But though the Holy See, following the\r\nadvice of those who were in a position to know what was best for the\r\ninterests of religion, consented to tolerate a policy of exclusion, it\r\nis clear that it had no sympathy with such a course of procedure. In\r\nDublin, for example, where English influence might be supposed to make\r\nitself felt most distinctly, out of forty-four appointments to\r\nbenefices made in Rome (1421-1520) more than half were given to\r\nIrishmen; in the diocese of Kildare forty-six out of fifty-eight\r\nappointments fell to Irishmen (1413-1521), and for the period 1431-\r\n1535, fifty-three benefices out of eighty-one were awarded in Meath to\r\nclerics bearing unmistakably Irish names.[10] Again in 1290 Nicholas\r\nIV. insisted that none but an Irishman should be appointed by the\r\nArchbishop of Dublin to the archdeaconry of Glendalough, and in 1482\r\nSixtus IV. upheld the cause of Nicholas O'Henisa whom the Anglo-Irish\r\nof Waterford refused to receive as their bishop on the ground that he\r\ncould not speak English.[11]\r\n\r\nBut though attempts were made by legislation to keep the Irish and\r\nEnglish apart, and though as a rule feeling between both parties ran\r\nhigh, there was one point on which both were in agreement, and that\r\nwas loyalty and submission to the Pope. That the Irish Church as such,\r\nlike the rest of the Christian world, accepted fully the supremacy of\r\nthe Pope at the period of the Norman invasion is evident from the\r\npresence and activity of the papal legates, Gillebert of Limerick, St.\r\nMalachy of Armagh, Christian, Bishop of Lismore, and St. Laurence\r\nO'Toole, from the frequent pilgrimages of Irish laymen and\r\necclesiastics to Rome, from the close relations with the Roman Court\r\nmaintained by St. Malachy during his campaign for reform, and from the\r\naction of the Pope in sending Cardinal Paparo to the national synod at\r\nKells (1152) to bestow the palliums on the Archbishops of Armagh,\r\nDublin, Cashel, and Tuam. Had there been any room for doubt about the\r\nprinciples and action of the Irish Church the question must\r\nnecessarily have been discussed at the Synod of Cashel convoked by\r\nHenry II. to put an end to the supposed abuses existing in the Irish\r\nChurch (1172), and yet, though it was laid down that in its liturgy\r\nand practices the Irish Church should conform to English customs, not\r\na word was said that could by any possibility imply that the Irish\r\npeople were less submissive to the Pope than any other nation at this\r\nperiod.[12]\r\n\r\nAfter the Normans had succeeded in securing a foothold in the country,\r\nboth Irish and Normans were at one in accepting the Roman supremacy.\r\nThe Pope appointed to all bishoprics whether situated within or\r\nwithout the Pale; he deposed bishops, accepted their resignations,\r\ntransferred them from one See to another, cited them before his\r\ntribunals, censured them at times, and granted them special faculties\r\nfor dispensing in matrimonial and other causes. He appointed to many\r\nof the abbeys and priories in all parts of the country, named\r\necclesiastics to rectories and vicarages in Raphoe, Derry, Tuam,\r\nKilmacduagh, and Kerry, with exactly the same freedom as he did in\r\ncase of Dublin, Kildare or Meath, and tried cases involving the rights\r\nof laymen and ecclesiastics in Rome or appointed judges to take\r\ncognisance of such cases in Ireland. He sent special legates into\r\nIreland, levied taxes on all benefices, appointed collectors to\r\nenforce the payment of these taxes, and issued dispensations in\r\nirregularities and impediments.\r\n\r\nThe fiction of two churches in Ireland, one the Anglo-Irish\r\nacknowledging the authority of the Pope, the other the Irish fighting\r\nsullenly against papal aggression, has been laid to rest by the\r\npublication of Theiner's /Vetera Monumenta Hibernorum et Scotorum/,\r\nthe /Calendars of Papal Letters/, the /Calendars of Documents\r\n(Ireland)/ and the /Annats/. If any writer, regardless of such\r\nstriking evidence, should be inclined to revive such a theory he\r\nshould find himself faced with the further disagreeable fact that,\r\nwhen the English nation and a considerable body of the Anglo-Irish\r\nnobles fell away from their obedience to Rome, the Irish people, who\r\nwere supposed to be hostile to the Pope, preferred to risk everything\r\nrather than allow themselves to be separated from the centre of unity.\r\nSuch a complete and instantaneous change of front, if historical,\r\nwould be as inexplicable as it would be unparalleled.\r\n\r\nNor is there any evidence to show that Lollardy or any other heresy\r\nfound any support in Ireland during the fourteenth or fifteenth\r\ncenturies. During the episcopate of Bishop Ledrede in Ossory (1317-\r\n60), it would appear both from the constitutions enacted in a diocesan\r\nsynod held in 1317 as well as from the measures he felt it necessary\r\nto take, that in the city of Kilkenny a few individuals called in\r\nquestion the Incarnation, and the Virginity of the Blessed Virgin, but\r\nit is clear that such opinions were confined to a very limited circle\r\nand did not affect the body of the people.[13] About the same time,\r\ntoo, the dispute that was being waged between John XXII. and a section\r\nof the Franciscans found an echo in the province of Cashel, though\r\nthere is no proof that the movement ever assumed any considerable\r\ndimensions.[14] Similarly at a later period, when the Christian world\r\nwas disturbed by the presence of several claimants to the Papacy and\r\nby the theories to which the Great Western Schism gave rise, news was\r\nforwarded to Rome that some of the Irish prelates, amongst them being\r\nthe Archbishop of Dublin and the Bishop of Ferns, were inclined to set\r\nat nought the instructions of Martin V. (1424), but the latter pontiff\r\ntook energetic measures to put an end to a phenomenon that was quite\r\nintelligible considering the general disorder of the period. The\r\nappeal of Philip Norris, Dean of Dublin, during his dispute with the\r\nMendicants, to a General Council against the decision of the Pope only\r\nserves to emphasise the fact that throughout the controversy between\r\nthe Pope and the Council of Basle Ireland remained unshaken in its\r\nattachment to the Holy See.[15] Although the first measure passed by\r\nthe Parliament at Kilkenny (1367) and by nearly every such assembly\r\nheld in Ireland in the fifteenth century was one for safeguarding the\r\nrights and liberties of the Church, yet the root of the evils that\r\nafflicted the Church at this period can be traced to the interference\r\nof kings and princes in ecclesiastical affairs. The struggle waged by\r\nGregory VII. in defence of free canonical election to bishoprics,\r\nabbacies, and priories seemed to have been completely successful, but\r\nin reality it led only to a change of front on the part of the secular\r\nauthorities. Instead of claiming directly the right of nomination they\r\nhad recourse to other measures for securing the appointment of their\r\nown favourites. In theory the election of bishops in Ireland rested\r\nwith the canons of the cathedral chapters, but they were not supposed\r\nto proceed with the election until they had received the /congé\r\nd'élite/ from the king or his deputy, who usually forwarded an\r\ninstruction as to the most suitable candidate. As a further safeguard\r\nit was maintained that, even after the appointment of the bishop-elect\r\nhad been confirmed by the Pope, he must still seek the approval of the\r\nking before being allowed to take possession of the temporalities of\r\nhis See. As a result even in the thirteenth century, when capitular\r\nelection was still the rule, the English sovereigns sought to exercise\r\na controlling influence on episcopal elections in Ireland, but they\r\nmet at times with a vigorous resistance from the chapters, the\r\nbishops, the Irish princes, and from Rome.[16]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fourteenth century, however, and in the\r\nfifteenth century, though the right of election was still enjoyed\r\nnominally by the chapters, in the majority of cases either their\r\nopinions were not sought, or else the capitular vote was taken as\r\nbeing only an expression of opinion about the merits of the different\r\ncandidates. Indirectly by means of the chancery rules regarding\r\nreservations, or by the direct reservation of the appointment of a\r\nparticular bishopric on the occasion of a particular vacancy, the Pope\r\nkept in his own hands the appointments. Owing to the encroachments of\r\nthe civil power and the pressure that was brought to bear upon the\r\nchapters such a policy was defensible enough, and had it been possible\r\nfor the Roman advisers to have had a close acquaintance with the\r\nmerits of the clergy, and to have had a free hand in their\r\nrecommendations, direct appointment might have been attended with good\r\nresults. But the officials at Rome were oftentimes dependent on\r\nuntrustworthy sources for their information, and they were still\r\nfurther handicapped by the fact that if they acted contrary to the\r\nking's wishes the latter might create serious trouble by refusing to\r\nrestore the temporalities of the See. Instances, however, are not\r\nwanting even in England itself to show that the Popes did not always\r\nallow themselves to be dictated to by the civil authorities, nor did\r\nthey recognise in theory the claim of the king to dispose of the\r\ntemporalities.[17]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine how far the English kings succeeded in\r\ninfluencing appointments to Irish bishoprics. About Dublin, Meath, and\r\nKildare there can be no doubt that their efforts were attended with\r\nsuccess. In Armagh, too, they secured the appointment of Englishmen as\r\na general rule, and in Cashel, Waterford, Limerick, and Cork their\r\nrecommendations, or rather the recommendations of the Anglo-Irish\r\nnobles, were followed in many instances. Outside the sphere of English\r\ninfluence it does not seem that their suggestions were adopted at\r\nRome. At any rate it is certain that if they sought for the exclusion\r\nof Irishmen their petitions produced little effect. During the early\r\nyears of the reign of Henry VIII. more active measures seem to have\r\nbeen taken by the king to assert his claims to a voice in episcopal\r\nappointments. In the appointments at this period to Armagh, Dublin,\r\nMeath, Leighlin, Kilmore, Clogher, and Ross it is stated expressly in\r\nthe papal Bulls that they were made /ad supplicationem regis/.[18]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately several of the ecclesiastics on whom bishoprics were\r\nconferred in Ireland during the fifteenth century had but slender\r\nqualifications for such a high office. On the one hand it was\r\nimpossible for Rome in many cases to have a close acquaintance with\r\nthe various candidates, and on the other the influence of the English\r\nkings, of the Irish princes, and of the Anglo-Irish nobles was used to\r\npromote their own dependents without reference to the effects of such\r\nappointments on the progress of religion. The Archbishops of Dublin\r\nand Armagh, and the Bishops of Kildare and Meath were more interested\r\nas a rule in political and religious affairs than in their duties as\r\nspiritual rulers. They held on many occasions the highest offices in\r\nthe state, and had little time to devote their attention to the\r\ngovernment of their dioceses. Absenteeism was as remarkable a\r\ncharacteristic of the Church in the fifteenth century as it was of the\r\nEstablished Church in the eighteenth, and in this direction the\r\nbishops were the worst offenders. Very often, too, Sees were left\r\nvacant for years during which time the king's officials or the Irish\r\nprinces, as the case might be, wasted the property of the diocese\r\neither with the connivance or against the wishes of the diocesan\r\nchapters. Of the archbishops of Ireland about the time of the\r\nReformation, George Cromer, a royal chaplain, was appointed because he\r\nwas likely to favour English designs in Ireland, and for that purpose\r\nwas named Chancellor of Ireland; John Alen, another Englishman, was\r\nrecommended by Cardinal Wolsey to Dublin mainly for the purpose of\r\noverthrowing the domination of the Earl of Kildare; Edmund Butler, the\r\nillegitimate son of Sir Piers Butler, owed his elevation to the See of\r\nCashel to the influence of powerful patrons, and Thomas O'Mullaly of\r\nTuam, a Franciscan friar, passed to his reward a few days before the\r\nmeeting of the Parliament that was to acknowledge Royal Supremacy, to\r\nbe succeeded by Christopher Bodkin, who allowed himself to be\r\nintroduced into the See by the authority of Henry VIII. against the\r\nwishes of the Pope.\r\n\r\nBut, even though the bishops as a body had been as zealous as\r\nindividuals amongst them undoubtedly were, they had no power to put\r\ndown abuses. The patronage of Church livings, including rectories,\r\nvicarages, and chaplaincies enjoyed by laymen, as well as by chapters,\r\nmonasteries, convents, hospitals, etc., made it impossible for a\r\nbishop to exercise control over the clergy of his diocese. Both Norman\r\nand Irish nobles were generous in their gifts to the Church, but\r\nwhenever they granted endowments to a parish they insisted on getting\r\nin return the full rights of patronage. Thus, for example, the Earl of\r\nKildare was recognised as the legal patron of close on forty rectories\r\nand vicarages situated in the dioceses of Dublin, Kildare, Meath,\r\nLimerick, and Cork, and he held, besides, the tithes of a vast number\r\nof parishes scattered over a great part of Leinster.[19] The Earl of\r\nOrmond enjoyed similar rights in Kilkenny and Tipperary, as did the\r\nDesmond family in the South, and the De Burgos in Connaught. The\r\nO'Neills,[20] O'Donnells, O'Connors, McCarthys, O'Byrnes, and a host\r\nof minor chieftains, exercised ecclesiastical patronage in their\r\nrespective territories. Very often these noblemen in their desire to\r\nbenefit some religious or charitable institution transferred to it the\r\nrights of patronage enjoyed by themselves. Thus the monastery of Old\r\nor Great Connal in Kildare controlled twenty-one rectories in Kildare,\r\nnineteen in Carlow, one in Meath and one in Tipperary,[21] while the\r\ncelebrated convent of Grace-Dieu had many ecclesiastical livings in\r\nits gift.\r\n\r\nOwing to these encroachments the bishop was obliged frequently to\r\napprove of the appointment of pastors who were in no way qualified for\r\ntheir position. The lay patrons nominated their own dependents and\r\nfavourites, while both ecclesiastical and lay patrons were more\r\nanxious about securing the revenues than about the zeal and activity\r\nof the pastors and vicars. Once the system of papal reservation of\r\nminor benefices was established fully in the fifteenth century, the\r\nauthority of the bishop in making appointments in his diocese became\r\nstill more restricted. Ecclesiastics who sought preferment turned\r\ntheir eyes towards Rome. If they could not go there themselves, they\r\nemployed a procurator to sue on their behalf, and armed with a papal\r\ndocument, they presented themselves before a bishop merely to demand\r\ncanonical institution. Though, in theory, therefore, the bishop was\r\nsupposed to be the chief pastor of a diocese, in practice he had very\r\nlittle voice in the nomination of his subordinates, and very little\r\neffective control over their qualifications or their conduct.\r\n\r\nVery often benefices were conferred on boys who had not reached the\r\ncanonical age for the reception of orders, sometimes to provide them\r\nwith the means of pursuing their studies, but sometimes also to enrich\r\ntheir relatives from the revenues of the Church. In such cases the\r\nentire work was committed to the charge of an underpaid vicar who\r\nadopted various devices to supplement his miserable income. Frequently\r\nmen living in England were appointed to parishes or canonries within\r\nthe Pale, and, as they could not take personal charge themselves, they\r\nsecured the services of a substitute. In defiance of the various\r\ncanons levelled against plurality of benefices, dispensations were\r\ngiven freely at Rome, permitting individuals to hold two, three, four,\r\nor more benefices, to nearly all of which the care of souls was\r\nattached. In proof of this one might refer to the case of Thomas\r\nRussel, a special favourite of the Roman Court, who held a canonry in\r\nthe diocese of Lincoln, the prebends of Clonmethan and Swords in\r\nDublin, the archdeaconry of Kells, the church of Nobber, the perpetual\r\nvicarship of St. Peter's, Drogheda, and the church of St. Patrick in\r\nTrim.[22]\r\n\r\nThis extravagant application of patronage and reservations to\r\necclesiastical appointments produced results in Ireland similar to\r\nthose it produced in other countries. It tended to kill learning and\r\nzeal amongst the clergy, to make them careless about their personal\r\nconduct, the proper observance of the canons, and the due discharge of\r\ntheir duties as pastors and teachers. Some of them were openly\r\nimmoral, and many of them had not sufficient learning to enable them\r\nto preach or to instruct their flocks. It ought to be remembered also\r\nthat in these days there were no special seminaries for the education\r\nof the clergy. Candidates for the priesthood received whatever\r\ntraining they got from some member of the cathedral chapter, or in the\r\nschools of the Mendicant Friars, or possibly from some of those\r\nlearned ecclesiastics, whose deaths are recorded specially in our\r\nAnnals. Before ordination they were subjected to an examination, but\r\nthe severity of the test depended on many extrinsic considerations.\r\nSome of the more distinguished youths were helped by generous patrons,\r\nor from the revenues of ecclesiastical benefices to pursue a higher\r\ncourse of studies in theology and canon law. As the various attempts\r\nmade to found a university in Ireland during the fourteen and\r\nfifteenth centuries[23] proved a failure, students who wished to\r\nobtain a degree were obliged to go to Oxford, from which various\r\nattempts were made to exclude \"the mere Irish\" by legislation,[24] to\r\nCambridge, Paris, or some of the other great schools on the Continent.\r\nIf one may judge from the large number of clerics who are mentioned in\r\nthe papal documents as having obtained a degree, a fair proportion of\r\nclerics during the fifteenth century both from within and without the\r\nPale must have received their education abroad. Still, the want of a\r\nproper training during which unworthy candidates might be weeded out,\r\ncoupled with the unfortunate system of patronage then prevalent in\r\nIreland, helped to lower the whole tone of clerical life, and to\r\nproduce the sad conditions of which sufficient evidence is at hand in\r\nthe dispensations from irregularities mentioned in the /Papal\r\nLetters/.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected in such circumstances, the cathedrals and\r\nchurches in some districts showed signs of great neglect both on the\r\npart of the ecclesiastics and of the lay patrons. Reports to Rome on\r\nthe condition of the cathedrals of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise[25]\r\nindicate a sad condition of affairs, but they were probably overdrawn\r\nin the hope of securing a reduction in the fees paid usually on\r\nepiscopal appointments, just as the account given by the Jesuit Father\r\nWolf about the cathedral of Tuam[26] was certainly overdrawn by\r\nArchbishop Bodkin with the object of obtaining papal recognition for\r\nhis appointment to that diocese. The Earl of Kildare represented the\r\nchurches of Tipperary and Kilkenny as in ruins owing to the exactions\r\nof his rival, the Earl of Ormond, while the latter, having determined\r\nfor political reasons to accept royal supremacy, endeavoured to throw\r\nthe whole blame on the Pope. Both statements may be regarded as\r\nexaggerated. But the occupation of the diocesan property during the\r\nvacancy of the Sees by the king or the nobles, the frequent wars\r\nduring which the churches were used as store-houses and as places of\r\nrefuge and defence, the neglect of the lay patrons to contribute their\r\nshare to the upkeep of the ecclesiastical buildings, and the\r\ncarelessness of the men appointed to major and minor benefices, so\r\nmany of whom were removed during the fifteenth century for alienation\r\nand dilapidation of ecclesiastical property, must have been productive\r\nof disastrous effects on the cathedrals and parish churches in many\r\ndistricts. Yet it would be a mistake to suppose that such neglect was\r\ngeneral throughout the country. The latter half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury and particularly the fifteenth century witnessed a great\r\narchitectural revival in Ireland, during which the pure Gothic of an\r\nearlier period was transformed into the vernacular or national\r\ncomposite style. Many beautiful churches, especially monastic\r\nchurches, were built, others were completely remodelled, and \"on the\r\nwhole it would not be too much to say that it is the exception to find\r\na monastery or a parish church in Ireland which does not show some\r\nwork executed at this period.\"[27]\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of canonical election, the interference of lay\r\npatrons, the too frequent use of papal reservations, and the\r\nappointment of commendatory abbots and priors, led to a general\r\ndownfall of discipline in the older religious orders, though there is\r\nno evidence to prove that the abuses were as general or as serious as\r\nthey have been painted. Even at the time when the agents of Henry\r\nVIII. were at work preparing the ground for the suppression of the\r\nmonasteries, and when any individual who would bring forward charges\r\nagainst them could count upon the king's favour, it was only against a\r\nfew members in less than half a dozen houses that grave accusations\r\nwere alleged. Even if these accusations were justified, and the\r\ncircumstances in which they were made are sufficient to arouse\r\nsuspicions about their historical value, it would not be fair to hold\r\nthe entire body of religious in Ireland responsible for abuses that\r\nare alleged only against the superiors or members of a small number of\r\nhouses situated in Waterford or Tipperary. Long before the question of\r\nseparation from his lawful wife had induced Henry VIII. to begin a\r\ncampaign in Ireland against Rome, the Mendicant Friars had undertaken\r\na definite programme of reform. In 1460 the Bishop of Killala in\r\nconjunction with the Franciscan Friar, Nehemias O'Donohoe, determined\r\nto introduce the Strict Observance into the Franciscan Houses,[28] and\r\nfrom that time forward in spite of obstacles from many quarters the\r\nObservants succeeded in getting possession of many of the old\r\nConventual Houses, and in establishing several new monasteries in all\r\nparts of Ireland, but particularly in the purely Irish districts. The\r\nDominicans, too, took steps to see that the original rules and\r\nconstitutions of the order should be observed. In 1484 Ireland was\r\nrecognised as a separate province, though the houses within the Pale\r\nwere allowed to continue under the authority of a vicar of the English\r\nprovincial, while at the same time a great reform of the order was\r\ninitiated. Several houses submitted immediately both within and\r\nwithout the Pale, amongst the earliest of them being Coleraine,\r\nDrogheda, Cork, and Youghal. The various religious orders of men did\r\nexcellent work in preaching, instructing the people, in establishing\r\nschools both for the education of clerics and laymen, and in tending\r\nto the wants of the poor and the infirm. In the report on the state of\r\nIreland presented to Henry VIII. it is admitted that, though the\r\nbishops and rectors and vicars neglected their duty, the \"poor friars\r\nbeggers\" preached the word of God.[29] That the people and nobles,\r\nboth Irish and Anglo-Irish, appreciated fully the labours and services\r\nof the Friars is evident from the number of new houses which they\r\nestablished for their reception during the fifteenth century. The\r\nconvents of Longford, Portumna, Tulsk, Burishool, Thomastown, and Gola\r\nwere established for the Dominicans; Kilconnell, Askeaton,\r\nEnniscorthy, Moyne, Adare, Monaghan, Donegal, and Dungannon for the\r\nFranciscans; Dunmore, Naas, Murrisk and Callan for the Augustinians,\r\nand Rathmullen, Frankfort, Castle-Lyons and Galway for the Carmelites.\r\n\r\nThe abuses that existed in the Irish Church at this period arose\r\nmainly from the enslavement of the Church, and they could have been\r\nremedied from within even had there been no unconstitutional\r\nrevolution. As a matter of fact those who styled themselves Reformers\r\nsucceeded only in transferring to their own sect the main sources of\r\nall previous abuses, namely, royal interference in ecclesiastical\r\naffairs and lay patronage, and by doing so they made it possible for\r\nthe Catholic Church in Ireland to pursue its mission unhampered by\r\noutside control. It ought to be borne in mind that the faults of\r\ncertain individuals or institutions do not prove that the whole\r\norganisation was corrupt, and that if there were careless and unworthy\r\nbishops, there were also worthy men like the Blessed Thaddeus\r\nMacCarthy of Cloyne, who though driven from his diocese by the\r\naggression of the nobles, was venerated as a saint both in Ireland and\r\nabroad. The great number of provincial and diocesan synods held in\r\nIreland during the period between 1450 and 1530 makes it clear that\r\nthe bishops were more attentive to their duties than is generally\r\nsupposed, while the collections of sermons in manuscript, the use of\r\ncommentaries on the Sacred Scriptures and of concordances, the\r\nattention paid to the Scriptures in the great Irish collections that\r\nhave come down to us, and the homilies in Irish on the main truths of\r\nreligion, on the primary duties of Christians, and on the Lives of the\r\nIrish Saints, afford some evidence that the clergy were not entirely\r\nnegligent of the obligations of their office. Had the clergy been so\r\nignorant and immoral, as a few of those foisted into Irish benefices\r\nundoubtedly were, the people would have risen up against them. And\r\nyet, though here and there some ill-feeling was aroused regarding the\r\ntemporalities, probates, fees, rents, rights of fishing, wills, etc.,\r\nthere is no evidence of any widespread hostility against the clergy,\r\nsecular or regular, or against Rome. The generous grants made to\r\nreligious establishments, the endowment of hospitals for the poor and\r\nthe infirm, the frequent pilgrimages to celebrated shrines in Ireland\r\nand on the Continent, the charitable and religious character of the\r\ncity guilds, and above all the adherence of the great body of the\r\npeople to the religion of their fathers in spite of the serious\r\nattempts that were made to seduce them, prove conclusively enough that\r\nthe alleged demoralisation of the Irish Church is devoid of historical\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nNor could it be said that the Irish people at this period were\r\nentirely rude and uncultured. Though most of their great schools had\r\ngone down, and though the attempts at founding a university had\r\nfailed, learning had certainly not disappeared from the country.\r\nClerics and laymen could still obtain facilities for education at the\r\nreligious houses, the cathedral and collegiate churches, at the\r\nschools of Irish law and poetry, and from some of the learned teachers\r\nwhose names are recorded in our Annals during this period. Many of the\r\nclerics, at least, frequented the English universities or the\r\nuniversities on the Continent. During the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies one can point to several distinguished Irish scholars such\r\nas O'Fihely, the Archbishop of Tuam, who was recognised as one of the\r\nleading theological writers of his day, Cathal Maguire the author of\r\nthe Annals of Ulster, Bishop Colby of Waterford, the author of several\r\ncommentaries on Sacred Scripture, the well-known Carmelite preacher\r\nand writer Thomas Scrope, Patrick Cullen Bishop of Clogher, and his\r\narch-deacon Roderick O'Cassidy, and Philip Norris, the determined\r\nopponent of the Mendicants, and the Dominicans John Barley, Joannes\r\nHibernicus, and Richard Winchelsey.[30] The catalogue of the books\r\ncontained in the library of the Franciscan convent at Youghal about\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century affords some indication of the\r\nattitude of the monastic bodies generally towards education and\r\nlearning. In addition to the missals, psalteries, antiphonies, and\r\nmartyrologies, the convent at Youghal had several copies of the Bible\r\ntogether with some of the principal commentaries thereon, collections\r\nof sermons by well-known authors, several of the works of the early\r\nFathers and of the principal theologians of the Middle Ages, the\r\nDecrees of Gratian, the Decretals and various works on Canon Law,\r\nspiritual reading-books, including the life of Christ, and works on\r\nascetic theology, the works of Boetius and various treatises on\r\nphilosophy, grammar, and music, and some histories of the Irish\r\nprovince of the Franciscans.[31]\r\n\r\nSimilarly the library of the Earl of Kildare about 1534 contained over\r\ntwenty books in Irish, thirty-four works in Latin, twenty-two in\r\nEnglish and thirty-six in French,[32] while the fact that Manus\r\nO'Donnell, Prince of Tyrconnell, could find time to compose a Life of\r\nSt. Columba in 1532, and that at a still later period Shane O'Neill\r\ncould carry on his correspondence with foreigners in elegant Latin\r\nbears testimony to the fact that at this period learning was not\r\nconfined to the Pale. Again it should be remembered that it was\r\nbetween the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries that the great Irish\r\ncollections such as the Book of Lecan, the Book of Ballymote, the\r\nLeabhar Breac, the Book of Lismore, etc., were compiled, and that it\r\nwas about the same time many of the more important Irish Annals were\r\ncompiled or completed, as were also translations of well-known Latin,\r\nFrench, and English works.[33]\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] Hardiman, /A Statute of the 40th Year of Edw.

Outside the very\r\nlimited area of the Pale English sheriffs or judges dare not appear to\r\nadminister English law; no taxes were paid to the crown; no levies of\r\ntroops could be raised, and the colonists could only hope for\r\ncomparative peace by paying an annual tribute to the most powerful of\r\ntheir Irish neighbours. The barony of Lecale in Down paid £40 a year\r\nto O'Neill of Clandeboy, Louth paid a similar sum to O'Neill of\r\nTyrone, Meath paid £300 a year to O'Connor of Offaly, Kildare £20 to\r\nO'Connor, Wexford £40 to the McMurroughs, Kilkenny and Tipperary £40\r\nto O'Carroll of Ely, Limerick city and county £80 to the O'Briens,\r\nCork £40 to the McCarthys, and so low had the government fallen that\r\nit consented to pay eighty marks yearly from the royal treasury to\r\nMcMurrough.[1]\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of his reign Henry VIII. was so deeply\r\ninterested in his schemes for subduing France and in continental\r\naffairs generally that he could give little attention to his dominions\r\nin Ireland. Sometimes the Earl of Kildare was superseded by the\r\nappointment of the Earl of Surrey (1520), and of Sir Piers Butler, the\r\nclaimant to the Earldom of Ormond (1521), and of Sir William\r\nSkeffington (1529), but as a general rule Kildare, whether as Deputy\r\nor as a private citizen, succeeded in dictating the policy of the\r\ngovernment. By his matrimonial alliances with the Irish chieftains,\r\nthe O'Neills, the MacCarthys, O'Carroll of Ely, and O'Connor of\r\nOffaly, his bargains with many of the other Irish and Anglo-Irish\r\nnobles, and by his well-known prowess in the field, he had succeeded\r\nin making himself much more powerful in Ireland than the English\r\nsovereign. But his very success had raised up against him a host of\r\nenemies, led by his old rival the Earl of Ormond, and supported by a\r\nlarge body of ecclesiastics, including Allen, the Archbishop of\r\nDublin, and of lay nobles. Various charges against him were forwarded\r\nto England, and in 1534 he was summoned to London to answer for his\r\nconduct. Before setting out on his last journey to London he appointed\r\nhis son, Lord Thomas Fitzgerald (Silken Thomas), then a youth of\r\ntwenty-one, to take charge of the government. The latter had neither\r\nthe wisdom nor the experience of his father. Rumours of his father's\r\nexecution, spread by the enemies of the Geraldines, having reached his\r\nears, despite the earnest entreaties of Archbishop Cromer of Armagh,\r\nhe resigned the sword of state, and called upon his retainers to\r\navenge the death of the Earl of Kildare (1534).\r\n\r\nThe rebellion of Silken Thomas forced Henry VIII. to undertake a\r\ndetermined campaign for the conquest of Ireland. His hopes of winning\r\nglory and territory in France had long since disappeared. He was about\r\nto break completely with Rome, and there was some reason to fear that\r\nCharles V. might make a descent upon the English coasts with or\r\nwithout the aid of the King of France. Were an invasion from the\r\nContinent undertaken before the conquest of Ireland had been finished\r\nit might result in the complete separation of that kingdom from\r\nEngland, and its transference to some foreign power. It was well known\r\nthat some of the Irish princes were in close correspondence with\r\nFrance and Scotland, that Silken Thomas was hoping for the assistance\r\nof the Emperor, and that once England had separated herself definitely\r\nfrom the Holy See, many of the Irish and Anglo-Irish nobles might be\r\ninduced to make common cause with the Pope against a heretical king.\r\nHitherto the king's only legal title to the Lordship of Ireland was\r\nthe supposed grant of Adrian IV., and as such a grant must necessarily\r\nlapse on account of heresy and schism a new title must be sought for\r\nin the complete conquest of the country. The circumstances were\r\nparticularly favourable for undertaking such a work. The royal\r\ntreasury was well supplied; England had little to fear for the time\r\nbeing from Francis I. or Charles V., as the energies of both were\r\nrequired for the terrible struggle between France and the Empire; the\r\nfriends of Ormond and the enemies of Kildare, both Irish and Anglo-\r\nIrish, could be relied upon to lend their aid, and even the Irish\r\nprinces friendly to Kildare might be conciliated by fair promises of\r\nreward. Relying upon all these considerations Henry VIII. determined\r\nto reduce Ireland to submission, and at the same time to put an end to\r\nits religious and political dependence on the Holy See.\r\n\r\nWilliam Skeffington was re-appointed Deputy and sent over to quell the\r\nrebellion, together with Sir Piers Butler who, in consideration of the\r\nbestowal upon him of the territories of the former Earls of Ormond,\r\nagreed to resist the usurped jurisdiction of the Pope especially in\r\nregard to appointments to benefices[2] (1534). The campaign opened\r\nearly in 1535, but as the new deputy was physically unable to command\r\na great military expedition, Lord Leonard Grey, the brother-in-law of\r\nthe Earl of Kildare, was soon entrusted with the conduct of the war.\r\nThough in the beginning Silken Thomas had met with success, the news\r\nthat the rumoured execution of the Earl was untrue, the murder of the\r\nArchbishop of Dublin by some of the Geraldine followers, and the\r\nexcommunication that such a deed involved, disheartened his army and\r\ncaused many of those upon whom he relied to desert him. At last in\r\nAugust 1535 he surrendered to Lord Grey who seems to have given him a\r\npromise of his life, but Henry VIII. was not the man to allow any\r\nobligations of honour to interfere with his policy. After having been\r\nkept in close confinement in the Tower for months he and his five\r\nuncles were hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn (1537). The king's\r\nonly regret was that the young heir to the Earldom of Kildare was\r\nallowed to escape, and the failure to capture his own sister's son was\r\none of the gravest charges brought afterwards against Lord Leonard\r\nGrey. As it was, the rebellion was suppressed; O'More of Leix,\r\nO'Carroll of Ely, O'Connor of Offaly, and the other Irish adherents of\r\nthe Geraldines were reduced to submission, and thereby the work of\r\nconquest was well begun.\r\n\r\nIn 1536, as a reward for the services he had rendered and in the hope\r\nthat he would carry the work of subjugation to a successful\r\nconclusion, Leonard Grey was appointed Deputy. Henry VIII. had\r\nseparated himself definitely from the Catholic Church and had induced\r\na large number of English bishops, ecclesiastics, and nobles to reject\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Pope in favour of royal supremacy. In England\r\nhe owed much of his success to the presence of Cranmer in the\r\nmetropolitan See of Canterbury, and to the skill with which his clever\r\ncouncillors manipulated Parliament so as to ensure its compliance with\r\nthe royal wishes. Hence, when he determined to detach Ireland from its\r\nallegiance to Rome, he resolved to utilise the Archbishop of Dublin\r\nand the Irish Parliament. Fortunately for him Dublin was then vacant\r\nowing to the murder of Archbishop Alen during the Geraldine rebellion\r\n(1534). After careful consideration he determined to confer the\r\narchbishopric on George Browne, an Augustinian friar, who had merited\r\nthe royal favour by preaching so strongly against Henry's marriage\r\nwith Catharine of Aragon that most of the congregation rose in a body\r\nand left the church. According to the imperial ambassador it was\r\nBrowne who officiated at the secret marriage of the king to Anne\r\nBoleyn, and it was on that account he was created provincial of the\r\nEnglish Augustinians and joined in a commission with Dr. Hilsey, the\r\nprovincial of the Dominicans, for a visitation of the religious houses\r\nin England.[3] The new archbishop received his commission from the\r\nking without reference to the Pope, and his consecration from Cranmer\r\n(1536). Browne was in every way a worthy representative of the new\r\nspiritual dictator and of the \"new learning.\" His nomination to Dublin\r\nwas condemned by the people of Lincoln because he had abandoned the\r\nChristian faith. Hardly had he arrived in Dublin when he found himself\r\nat loggerheads with Lord Grey, who treated him with studied contempt\r\nand took very violent measures to cool his religious ardour. He was\r\nassailed by his royal spiritual head for his arrogance and\r\ninefficiency, and warned to take heed lest he who had made him a\r\nbishop might unmake him. By his fellow-labourers and associates in the\r\nwork of spreading the gospel, Staples of Meath and Bale of Ossory, he\r\nwas denounced as a heretic, an avaricious dissembler, a drunkard, and\r\na profligate, who preached only two sermons with which the people\r\nbecame so familiar that they knew what to expect once he had announced\r\nhis text.[4]\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of Browne in Ireland careful steps were taken by\r\nthe deputy and the Earl of Ormond to ensure that only trustworthy men\r\nshould be elected as \"knights of the shire,\" while the lawyers were\r\nhard at work both in England and Ireland drafting the laws that\r\nParliament was expected to ratify. The assembly opened on Monday, 1st\r\nMay, at Dublin, was adjourned (31 May) to Kilkenny, then to Cashel (28\r\nJuly), then to Limerick (2 Aug.), from which place it returned once\r\nmore to Dublin. The next session opened in September (1536), and after\r\nseveral short sessions and long adjournments it was prorogued finally\r\nin December 1537. As far as can be seen no representatives attended\r\nthis parliament except from the Pale and from the territories under\r\nthe influence of the Earl of Ormond and his adherents. It was in no\r\nsense an Irish Parliament, as not a single Irish layman took part in\r\nit, nor could it be described accurately even as a Parliament of\r\nLeinster. It is generally assumed that together with the Act of\r\nAttainder against the party of Kildare all the legislation passed\r\nalready in England, including the Act of Succession and of Royal\r\nSupremacy, the Acts against the authority of the Bishop of Rome,\r\nagainst appeals to Rome, and transferring to the king the First\r\nFruits, etc., were passed always immediately and with very little\r\nopposition except a strong protest lodged by Archbishop Cromer of\r\nArmagh. But an examination of the correspondence that passed between\r\nthe authorities in Dublin and in London reveals a very different\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nIt is true that on the 17th May Brabazon informed Cromwell that the\r\nAct of Attainder against Kildare, the Acts of Succession, of Royal\r\nSupremacy and of First Fruits had already passed the Commons, and that\r\non the 1st June the Deputy wrote that all these, including the Act\r\nagainst Appeals to Rome, had passed the Parliament, and that in the\r\nsame month Cromwell expressed his thanks to some of the Irish\r\nofficials for having secured the assent of Parliament to all these\r\nmeasures. But in spite of these assurances of victory secured before\r\nParliament had been a month in session, there must have occurred some\r\nvery serious hitch in the programme. In October 1536, Robert Cowley\r\nwrote to Cromwell to complain that certain acts had been rejected\r\nowing to the action of some \"ringleaders or bellwethers,\" who had\r\ndecided to send a deputation to England to argue stiffly against them,\r\nthat Patrick Barnewall, the king's sergeant was on the side of the\r\ndiscontents, and that he declared in the House of Commons that \"he\r\nwould not grant that the king had as much spiritual power as the\r\nBishop of Rome, or that he could dissolve religious houses.\" As\r\nnothing could be done, the session was adjourned till February (1537),\r\nwhen the Deputy announced that owing to the confusion caused in the\r\nCommons by the reported return of Silken Thomas, and to the boldness\r\nof the spirituality on account of the religious rebellion which had\r\ntaken place in England, no measures could be passed, and a further\r\nadjournment was necessary. When Parliament met again matters were\r\nstill going badly for the king. The Deputy informed Cromwell that the\r\nspirituality was still obstinate; that the spiritual peers refused to\r\ndebate any bill till they should receive satisfactory assurances that\r\nthe spiritual proctors or representatives of the clergy should be\r\nallowed to vote, and that as the Parliament had refused to pass the\r\nbill imposing a tax of one-twentieth of their annual revenues on the\r\nholders of benefices, he was obliged to adjourn till July. He warned\r\nCromwell that as the proctors and the bishops had formed a combination\r\nlittle could be passed until the proctors were deprived of their\r\nvotes, and he suggested that as a means of overcoming the resistance\r\nof the spirituality the king should send over a special commissioner\r\nto be present at the opening of the next session.\r\n\r\nActing on this suggestion a royal commission, consisting of Anthony\r\nSt. Leger, George Poulet, Thomas Moyle, and William Berners, was\r\ndispatched to Ireland (July 1537) to deliver the following acts to be\r\npassed by Parliament, namely, acts depriving the spiritual proctors of\r\ntheir right to vote, and against the power of the Bishop of Rome,\r\ntogether with acts giving to the king the tax of one-twentieth on\r\nbenefices, enforcing the use of the English language and dress, and\r\nprohibiting alliances with the \"wild Irish.\" At the same time Henry\r\nwrote to the Deputy and council warning them to obey the instructions\r\nof the commissioners, and to the House of Lords ordering them to\r\nratify the bills to be submitted, and telling them that if any member\r\nbe unwilling to do so, \"we shall look upon him with our princely eye\r\nas his ingratitude therein shall be little to his comfort.\" When\r\nParliament met again in October the spiritual proctors were deprived\r\nof their votes, and it was only then that the Act against the Bishop\r\nof Rome could be carried. The threats of royal vengeance seem to have\r\nproduced the same effects in the Dublin assembly as in the English\r\nParliament. Probably, as happened in England, those who could not\r\nagree with the measures were content to absent themselves during the\r\ndiscussions.[5] The truth is, therefore, that Archbishop Cromer was\r\nsupported in his attitude by the bishops and the representatives of\r\nthe clergy, and that the acts against the jurisdiction of the Pope\r\nwere carried against the wishes of the spirituality.\r\n\r\nBut the placing of the acts upon the statute book did not mean that\r\nthe cause of the king had triumphed. Steps must be taken to enforce\r\nthe laws against the jurisdiction of the Pope. Already in October 1537\r\nthe royal commissioners, who had been sent over by the king to overawe\r\nthe Parliament, undertook a judicial tour through the south-eastern\r\nportion of Ireland to inquire into the grievances of the people, and\r\nespecially to secure grounds of complaint against the ecclesiastics,\r\nso as to enable the government to overcome the opposition of their\r\nrepresentatives in Parliament. During their journey they held sessions\r\nat Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford, New Ross, Clonmel, and Tipperary. In\r\nthe circumstances it is not difficult to understand how easy it was\r\nfor them to find individuals ready to come forward with accusations\r\nboth against the lay lords and the clergy, especially as the\r\ncommissioners in some cases at least suggested the points of\r\ncomplaint. In Wexford, for example, the crime alleged against the Dean\r\nof Ferns and three other priests of having \"pursued\" Bulls from Rome\r\nhas a very suspicious ring. Against many individual clerics, including\r\nthe Archbishop of Cashel and the Bishop of Waterford, the priors and\r\nheads of several religious houses and certain rectors and vicars, it\r\nwas alleged that they levied various exactions like the lay lords,\r\nthat they demanded excessive fees on the occasion of their\r\nministrations, and that they asserted claims to fishing weirs, etc.,\r\nto which they were not entitled. If it be borne in mind that the\r\nbishops, priors, and heads of religious houses were also landlords\r\nlike the lay lords, against whom charges of almost similar exactions\r\nwere lodged, the presentments of grievances at least in this respect\r\nwere not very convincing. For the same reason the fact that the\r\nArchbishop of Cashel was said to have been in a boat which robbed a\r\nboat from Clonmel and that he caused a riot in the latter city, that\r\nthe Bishop of Waterford and Lismore took bribes, or that Purcell, the\r\nBishop of Ferns, joined with O'Kavanagh in an attack upon Fethard need\r\nnot cause any surprise. It was only against James Butler, the\r\nCistercian abbot of Inislonagh and his monks, the Augustinian monks of\r\nAthassel, the Carmelite priors of Lady Abbey near Clonmel and\r\nKnocktopher, and the abbot of Duisk that grave charges of immorality\r\nwere made. Even if these charges were true, and the evidence is by no\r\nmeans convincing, they serve only to emphasise the downfall of\r\ndiscipline caused in the individual religious houses by the\r\ninterference with canonical election, and the intrusion oftentimes by\r\nfamily influence of unworthy men as abbots or commendatory abbots.[6]\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. was anxious to complete the conquest of Ireland even\r\nbefore he had broken with the Pope, but after the separation of\r\nEngland from Rome he realised more clearly the dangers that might\r\nensue unless the Irish and Anglo-Irish princes were reduced to\r\nsubmission. As things stood, Ireland instead of contributing anything\r\nwas a constant source of loss to the royal treasury, and, were an\r\ninvasion attempted by some of his Continental rivals, Ireland might\r\nbecome a serious menace to England's independence. The complete\r\noverthrow of the Geraldine rebellion (1535) had prepared the way for a\r\nmore general advance, but the failure of the Deputy to capture the\r\nyoung heir to the Earldom of Kildare was as displeasing to the king\r\npersonally as it was dangerous to his plans. The boy was conveyed away\r\nsecretly by his tutor, a priest named Leverous, who was advanced\r\nafterwards to the See of Kildare, and was brought for safety to the\r\nterritory of O'Brien of Thomond. When Thomond was threatened by the\r\nrapid advance of the Deputy, the young Earl of Kildare was conveyed to\r\nhis aunt, Lady Eleanor MacCarthy of Cork, who on her marriage to Manus\r\nO'Donnell, Prince of Tyrconnell, brought the boy with her to Donegal\r\n(1538).\r\n\r\nO'Connor of Offaly and O'Carroll had been compelled to sue for peace\r\n(1535). In the following year Lord Grey made a tour of the south-\r\neastern parts of Leinster, proceeded through Tipperary, and directed\r\nhis march against the strongholds of O'Brien of Thomond. Partly by his\r\nown skill and boldness, partly also by the treachery of one of the\r\nO'Briens, he succeeded in capturing some of the principal fortresses\r\nincluding O'Brien's Bridge. Had it not been for a mutiny that broke\r\nout among his soldiers Lord Grey might have succeeded in forcing\r\nO'Brien to make terms, but, as it was, he was obliged to desist from\r\nfurther attack and to retreat hastily to Dublin. O'Brien soon\r\nrecaptured the positions he had lost; O'Connor of Offaly took the\r\nfield once more, and the unfortunate Deputy, harassed by his enemies\r\non the privy council and blamed by the king for his failure to get\r\npossession of the hope of the Geraldines, found himself in the\r\ngreatest difficulties. But he was a man of wonderful military\r\nresource, and knowing well that failure must mean his own recall and\r\npossibly his execution, he determined to put forth all his energies in\r\nanother great effort. So long as the Irish in the Leinster districts\r\nwere active it was little use for him to undertake dangerous\r\nexpeditions towards the more remote districts, and for this reason he\r\nturned his attention to O'Connor of Offaly. Before many months elapsed\r\nhe forced the MacMurroughs, the Kavanaghs, the O'Moores, the\r\nO'Carrolls, MacGillapatrick of Ossory, and O'Connor to sue humbly for\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nBut many difficulties still remained to be overcome before he could\r\nboast of final victory. Con O'Neill, Manus O'Donnell, and many of\r\ntheir adherents were still threatening; Desmond, O'Brien of Thomond\r\nand the nobles of Munster generally could not be relied upon; while\r\nthe Irish and Anglo-Irish of Connaught paid but scanty respect to the\r\nking or his deputy. Rumours, too, were in circulation that North and\r\nSouth were about to unite in defence of the heir of the Geraldines,\r\nthat secret communications were carried on with Scotland, France, and\r\nthe Empire, and that the Pope was in full sympathy with the\r\nmovement.[7] Surrounded by discontented subordinates, who forwarded\r\ncomplaints almost weekly to England in the hope of securing his\r\ndisgrace, Lord Grey was resolved to push forward rapidly even though\r\nthe campaign might prove risky. In 1538 he marched south and west,\r\npassing by Limerick through the territories of O'Brien and Clanrickard\r\nto Galway, having received everywhere the submission of the princes\r\nexcept of O'Brien and the Earl of Desmond. In the following year\r\n(1539) he directed his attention towards the North, but O'Neill and\r\nO'Donnell, having composed their differences, and having strengthened\r\nthemselves by an understanding with the Earl of Desmond and the\r\nadherents of the Geraldines, marched south in the hope of joining\r\nhands with their allies. Having learned when in the neighbourhood of\r\nTara that the Deputy was on the march against them, they retreated\r\ntowards the confines of Monaghan, where they were overtaken and routed\r\nat Bellahoe near Carrickmacross (1539). Their defeat seems to have\r\ndestroyed the spirit of the Irish princes. One by one they began to\r\nbeg for terms, so that before Lord Grey was recalled in 1540 he had\r\nthe satisfaction of knowing that he had vindicated English authority\r\nin the country. Instead of rewarding his deputy for all that he had\r\ndone, Henry VIII., giving credence to the stories circulated by\r\nArchbishop Browne and others that Lord Grey had connived at the escape\r\nof the young Kildare and had supported the cause of Rome, committed\r\nhim to the Tower, and later on he handed him over to the executioner\r\n(1541).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile how fared it with the new archbishop who had been sent over\r\nto enlighten the Irish nation? In July 1537 Henry felt it necessary to\r\nreprove his spiritual representative for his lightness of behaviour,\r\nhis vain-glory, and his remissness in preaching the pure word of God,\r\nand to warn him that if he did not show himself more active both in\r\nreligious matters and in advancing the king's cause he should be\r\nobliged to put a man of more honesty in his place.[8] The archbishop\r\nissued a form of prayer in English to be read in all the churches,\r\nextolling royal supremacy and denouncing the Pope, but it produced no\r\neffect. Once, when the archbishop attended High Mass in St. Andrew's,\r\nthe rector mounted the pulpit to read the prayer, but immediately one\r\nof the canons gave a signal to the choir to proceed, and the\r\narchiepiscopal message was lost to the congregation. In January 1538\r\nhe acknowledged that though the influence of the king ought to be\r\ngreatest within the city and province of Dublin, yet, notwithstanding\r\nhis gentle exhortation, his evangelical instruction, his insistence on\r\noaths of obedience, and his threats of sharp correction, he could not\r\ninduce any one to preach the word of God or the just title of the\r\nking; that men who preached formerly till Christians were tired of\r\nthem, would not open their lips except in secret, when they gave full\r\nvent to their opinions and thereby destroyed the fruits of the labour\r\nof their archbishop; that the Observant Friars were the worst\r\noffenders of all, refusing to take the oath and showing open contempt\r\nfor his authority; that he could not persuade the clergy to erase the\r\nname of the Pope from the Canon of the Mass and was obliged to send\r\nhis own servants to carry out this work; that a papal indulgence had\r\nbeen published in Ireland of which many had hastened to take advantage\r\nby fulfilling the conditions laid down, namely, fasting on Wednesday,\r\nFriday, and Saturday and receiving Holy Communion, and that all\r\nbishops \"made by the king\" except himself were repelled to make way\r\nfor these appointed by Rome.[9] Although the chapter in Dublin had\r\nbeen packed carefully to prepare the way for the election of Browne,\r\nthe archbishop was forced to complain that he had been withstood to\r\nhis face by one of the prebendaries, James Humfrey, and that of the\r\nstaff of the cathedral, twenty-eight in number, there was scarce one\r\n\"that favoured the word of God.\"[10]\r\n\r\nIn a letter sent to Cromwell (1538) Agarde informed him that the power\r\nof the Bishop of Rome was still strong, that the Observant Friars\r\nupheld it boldly, that nobody dared to say anything against them as\r\nnearly all in authority were in favour of the Pope except Browne,\r\nAlen, Master of the Rolls, Brabazon the Vice-Treasurer, and one or two\r\nothers of no importance, and that the temporal lawyers who drew the\r\nking's fees could not be trusted.[11] Everywhere throughout the\r\ncountry it was the same story. Those who should set an example to\r\nothers resorted to the Friars for confession, and were encouraged in\r\ntheir boldness; Nangle, who had been intruded into the See of Clonfert\r\nby the king, was driven out by Roland de Burgo, the papal bishop, and\r\ndared not show himself in his diocese; never was there so much \"Rome-\r\nrunning\" in the country, four or five bishops together with several\r\npriors and abbots having been appointed lately by the Pope, while a\r\nfriar and a bishop, probably Rory O'Donnell of Derry, who had been\r\narrested, were tried and acquitted at Trim,[12] because the people in\r\nauthority were hypocrites and worshippers of idols.[13]\r\n\r\nFrom 1536 therefore till 1538 the new gospel had made small progress\r\nin Ireland. Had the men entrusted with its propagation been of one\r\nmind they might have used the king's power with some effect, but the\r\nDeputy, the Archbishop of Dublin, and the Bishop of Meath were at each\r\nothers throats almost continually. The Deputy treated the archbishop\r\nwith studied contempt, spoke of him as a \"poll-shorn\" friar and\r\nobstructed his plans. According to Browne and his friends Alen and\r\nBrabazon, the Deputy befriended the papists and the friars, knelt in\r\nprayer before the shrine of Our Lady of Trim, and supported a bishop\r\nappointed by Rome against one appointed by the king. Edward Staples, a\r\nformer protégé of Cardinal Wolsey, by whom he was recommended to Rome,\r\nwas appointed by the Pope to Meath in 1530, but being a steady\r\nopponent of the Geraldines he was obliged to escape to his own country\r\nin 1534. There he took the side of the king against Clement VII., and\r\non his return to Ireland, after he had received a sharp admonition\r\nfrom the king, he undertook to preach in favour of royal supremacy.\r\nBut his views did not coincide with those of the Archbishop of Dublin.\r\nThe latter was obliged to complain that Staples denounced him as \"a\r\nheretic and a beggar with other rabulous revilings,\" and that not\r\ncontent with this, he preached in the church at Kilmainham where \"the\r\nstations and pardons\" were used as freely as ever, and attacked the\r\narchbishop before his face with \"such a stomach as I think the three-\r\nmouthed Cerberus of hell could not have uttered it more viperously.\"\r\nHe glossed every sentence (of the archbishops sermons) after such\r\nopprobrious fashion that every honest ear glowed to hear it, and \"he\r\nexhorted them all, yea, and so much as in him lay he adjured them, to\r\ngive no credence to (their spiritual guide) whatsoever he might say,\r\nfor before God he would not.\"[14] The Bishop of Meath replied that the\r\narchbishop had given himself such airs that every honest man was weary\r\nof him and that he (the bishop) had come to the conclusion that \"pride\r\nand arrogance hath ravished him from the right remembrance of\r\nhimself.\" In reply to Browne's covert hint that Staples was conniving\r\nat the authority of the Pope, the latter charged the archbishop, whom\r\nhe described as his purgatory, with abhorring the Mass, and prayed\r\nthat an inquiry should be held.[15] An attempt was made to patch up\r\nthe quarrel, but the archbishop was far from content that his\r\nauthority had not been upheld.[16]\r\n\r\nFor so far the Reformation had made little or no progress in Ireland,\r\nand apparently bishops, clergy and people were still strong on the\r\nside of Rome. But during the successful military expedition undertaken\r\nby Lord Grey into the centre, south, and west of Ireland in 1538, he\r\nclaimed to have achieved great success. In March 1538 O'Connor of\r\nOffaly made his submission, promising at the same time not to admit\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Roman Pontiff or to allow others to admit\r\nit.[17] The Earl of Ormond and the Butler family generally were\r\nattached to the king's cause on account of their opposition to the\r\nGeraldines. O'Carroll of Ely agreed to accept the king's peace, but\r\nthere is no evidence that he agreed to the king's religious programme.\r\nAt Limerick, according to the Deputy's own story, the mayor and\r\ncorporation took the oath of Royal Supremacy, and renounced the\r\nauthority of the Pope, as did also the bishop, who promised\r\nfurthermore to induce his clergy to follow this example. Similarly in\r\nGalway, he assured the king, he had sworn the mayor, corporation and\r\nbishop to resist the usurped jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome.[18]\r\nBut as against the trustworthiness of this report it should be\r\nremembered that it is contradicted in very important particulars by\r\nanother official account of the proceedings written by eye-witnesses,\r\nthat the Deputy's doings on this occasion were belittled and\r\ndisparaged by the privy council, that Browne charged Grey with having\r\ndeposed, while he was in the neighbourhood of Limerick, a bishop\r\nappointed by the king to make room for a Franciscan friar provided by\r\nthe Pope,[19] and with having supported the Mayor of Limerick, who was\r\na strong adherent of the Geraldines, that according to the same\r\nauthority, while Grey was in Galway he entertained right royally a\r\nbishop, probably Roland de Burgo, \"who had expelled the king's\r\npresentee from the Bishopric of Clonfert,\" and that, finally, in\r\nRobert Cowley's opinion Grey's expedition had for its object not so\r\nmuch the extension of the king's territory as the formation of a\r\nGeraldine League amongst the Irish and Anglo-Irish of the South and\r\nWest to support O'Neill and O'Donnell.[20]\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear in mind that the highest English officials in\r\nIreland at this period were divided into two factions, one favouring\r\nthe Deputy, and another attempting to secure his downfall by charging\r\nhim with being too friendly towards the Papists and the Geraldines.\r\nThe leaders of the latter section, and, according to a trustworthy\r\nwitness, the only men in authority who favoured the campaign against\r\nthe Pope were Browne, Alen, the Master of the Rolls, Brabazon, the\r\nVice-Treasurer, and one or two others, amongst whom might be reckoned\r\nAylmer the Chief Justice.[21] They were annoyed at the reported\r\nsuccess of Lord Grey in 1538, and however much they tried to disparage\r\nit, they felt that unless they could accomplish something remarkable\r\nfor the king's cause the triumph of the Deputy was assured. Early in\r\nDecember 1538 a message had been received containing \"an advertisement\r\nfor the setting forth of the Word of God, abolishing of the Bishop of\r\nRome's usurped authority, and extinguishing of idolatry.\"[22]\r\nImmediately the members of the council hostile to Lord Grey saw their\r\nopportunity of scoring a signal victory. If they could not penetrate\r\ninto the North or West they determined to make an excursion into the\r\n\"four shires above the Barrow\" to assert the king's supremacy, \"but\r\nalso to levy the first fruits and twentieth part with other of the\r\nking's revenue.\" Leaving Dublin towards the end of December they\r\nproceeded first to Carlow, where they were entertained by Lord James\r\nButler, and thence to Kilkenny, where they were welcomed by the Earl\r\nof Ormond. On New Year's Day the archbishop preached to a large\r\naudience setting forth the royal (or rather Cromwell's) Injunctions\r\n(1536), several copies of which were supplied to the bishops and\r\ndignitaries of the diocese for the use of the clergy. Something\r\nsimilar was done in Ross, Wexford, and Waterford, except that in the\r\nlatter place they hanged a friar in his habit, and ordered that his\r\ncorpse should be left on the gallows \"for a mirror to all others of\r\nhis brethren to live truly.\" Next they visited Clonmel, in which town\r\naccording to their own story they achieved their greatest success. \"At\r\nClonmel was with us two archbishops and eight bishops, in whose\r\npresence my Lord of Dublin preached in advancing the King's Supremacy,\r\nand the extinguishment of the Bishop of Rome. And, his sermon\r\nfinished, all the said bishops, in all the open audience, took the\r\noath mentioned in the Acts of Parliament, both touching the king's\r\nsuccession and supremacy, before me, the king's chancellor; and divers\r\nothers present did the like.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThough, as shall be seen, there was probably some foundation for this\r\nreport, there are many things about it which would seem to indicate\r\nthat its authors were guilty of gross exaggeration. In the first place\r\nit should be noted that though it is headed \"The Council of Ireland to\r\nCromwell,\" it is signed only by Browne, Alen, Brabazon, and Aylmer,\r\nthe sworn enemies of the Deputy, and the very men who had denounced\r\nhim for magnifying his success in the previous year. Secondly, it\r\ndeals only in generalities, giving no particulars about the names of\r\nthe archbishops or bishops who were alleged to have been present,\r\nthough such details would have been of the highest importance.\r\nThirdly, as can be seen from the correspondence of the period, Browne\r\nwas not accustomed to hide his merits or his services, and yet in a\r\npersonal letter written to Cromwell a week later he merely states that\r\nduring the month he spent in Munster \"he did not only preach and set\r\nforth the word of God, but also my master, the King's Highness most\r\ngoodly purpose.\"[24] Lastly, it should not be forgotten that, though\r\nBrowne and his friends claim to have been honoured with the presence\r\nof the bishops from the entire province of Munster, yet at that time\r\nthe Earl of Desmond and his adherents, O'Brien of Thomond, the\r\nMacCarthys and nearly all the Irish and Anglo-Irish nobles of the\r\nprovince, with the exception of the Ormond faction which controlled\r\nonly a portion of south-eastern Munster, were still loyal to Rome. The\r\nobject of the report, then, seems to have been to destroy the\r\ninfluence of the Deputy and the effect of his victory, by showing what\r\nhis opponents had effected and could effect if only their hands were\r\nnot tied by the action of a superior who was leagued with the Papists\r\nand the enemies of the crown. Any one acquainted with the miserable\r\nintrigues and petty jealousies revealed by the official correspondence\r\nof the period can have no difficulty in believing that the authors of\r\nthis report would have had little scruple in departing from the truth.\r\n\r\nThough Browne, like his masters Cromwell and Cranmer, was inclined to\r\npush forward rapidly with his radical schemes of reform, yet, well\r\naware of the state of feeling in Dublin and throughout the country, he\r\nfeared to give offence by proceeding at once to extremes. At first he\r\ncontented himself with issuing the \"bedes\" or a form of prayer for the\r\nking as supreme head of the church, for Prince Edward, for the Deputy,\r\ncouncil, and nobles, and for the faithful departed. Encouraged,\r\nhowever, by the wholesale attack on images and pilgrimage shrines\r\nbegun in England (1538), he determined to undertake a similar work in\r\nIreland in the same year. But such a work proved to be so distasteful\r\nto the people that he was obliged to deny that he had any intention of\r\npulling down the image of Our Lady of Trim or the Holy Cross in\r\nTipperary, though in his letter to Cromwell he admitted that \"his\r\nconscience would right well serve him to oppress such idols.\"[25] In\r\nAugust of the same year Lord Butler reported to Cromwell that the\r\nvicar of Chester announced in the presence of the Deputy, the\r\narchbishop, and several members of the council that the king had\r\ncommanded that images should be set up again and worshipped as before,\r\nwhereupon the Deputy remained silent, but some of the others answered,\r\nthat if the vicar were not protected by the presence of the Deputy\r\nthey \"would put him fast by the heels,\" as he deserved grievous\r\npunishment.[26] In October Lord Grey, the Archbishop of Dublin, and\r\nothers attended the sessions at Trim for the trial of a bishop and of\r\na Franciscan friar, and, to the no small indignation of the\r\narchbishop, Lord Grey visited the shrine of Our Lady of Trim to pray\r\nbefore the image.[27] The encouragement given to Browne and his\r\nfriends by Cromwell's instructions (Dec. 1538) strengthened them to\r\ncontinue their campaign \"for the plucking down of idols and the\r\nextinguishing of idolatry.\" The shrine of Our Lady at Trim was\r\ndestroyed; the Staff of Jesus was burned publicly; the Cross of\r\nBallybogan was broken, and a special commission was established to\r\nsearch for and to destroy images, pictures, and relics.[28] Even the\r\nDeputy, who was accused of favouring idols and papistry, had already\r\ndespoiled the Cathedral of Down, the monastery of Killeigh and the\r\ncollegiate church of Galway, though in all probability this action was\r\ntaken not so much out of contempt for the practices of the Church as\r\nwith the hope of raising money to pay his troops, and of securing the\r\nfavour of the king.\r\n\r\nIn England Henry VIII. had turned his attention almost immediately\r\nafter the separation from Rome to the suppression of the monasteries\r\nand religious houses. This step was undertaken by him, partly because\r\nthe religious orders were the strongest and most energetic supporters\r\nof the Pope, and partly, also, because he wished to enrich the royal\r\ntreasury by the plunder of the goods and possessions of the\r\nmonasteries. In England, however, some form of justice was observed;\r\nbut in Ireland no commission was appointed to report on the condition\r\nof the monasteries or convents, and no opportunity was given them to\r\ndefend themselves against the slanderous statements of officials, who\r\nwere thirsting to get possession of their lands and their revenues.\r\nAccording to the estimate given by De Burgo, there were in Ireland at\r\nthe time of Henry VIII. two hundred and thirty-one houses of the\r\nCanons Regular of St. Augustine, thirty-six houses belonging to the\r\nPremonstratensians, twenty-two of the Knights of St. John, fourteen to\r\nthe Trinitarians or Crouched Friars, nine to the Benedictines, forty-\r\ntwo to the Cistercians, forty-three to the Dominicans, sixty-five to\r\nthe Franciscans, twenty-six to the Hermits of St. Augustine, twenty-\r\nfive to the Carmelites, and forty-three belonging to various\r\ncommunities of Nuns.[29] Though in many particulars this summary is\r\nfar from being accurate, it may be taken as giving a fairly correct\r\nidea of the number of religious houses at the period. Many of these\r\ninstitutions were possessed of immense wealth, derived for the most\r\npart from lands and church patronage. According to a return drawn up\r\nin 1536 the annual revenue of the religious houses in Meath was set\r\ndown at £900 Irish money, in Dublin at £900, in Louth at £600, and in\r\nKildare at £255. If steps were taken to suppress immediately the\r\nhouses within these four shires it was reckoned that the king might\r\nsecure an annual revenue of £3,000, but if the communities concerned\r\ngot warning of the danger it was thought that the king would lose\r\n£1,000 of this.[30]\r\n\r\nBy Henry's orders steps were taken in 1536 to secure the approval of\r\nParliament for the suppression of the monasteries, but though the\r\nAbbey of St. Wolstan near Leixlip, belonging to the Canons Regular of\r\nSt. Victor was suppressed, both the spiritual and the lay peers\r\ntogether with the proctors of the clergy offered a strenuous\r\nopposition to the attack on the religious establishments. They knew\r\nbetter than the English officials the work that was being done by many\r\nof these institutions for religion, education, and hospitality, as\r\nwell as for the comfort of the poor and the infirm. In October 1537,\r\nhowever, an act was passed for the suppression of Bective, St. Peter's\r\nbeside Trime, Duisk, Duleek, Holmpatrick, Baltinglass, Taghmolin,\r\nDunbrody, Tintern, and Ballybogan. Their lands, houses and possessions\r\ngenerally were to be vested in the king, and a pension was to be\r\nsecured to the abbots and priors.[31] Together with these, eight\r\nabbies mentioned in a special commission under the great seal were\r\nsuppressed.[32]\r\n\r\nThe other religious houses, alarmed by the course of proceedings both\r\nin England and at home, began to cut down the timber on their\r\nproperties, to dispose of their goods, to hide their valuable church\r\nplate, and to lease their farms. Urgent appeals were sent to Cromwell\r\nfrom Archbishop Browne and others, requesting that a commission should\r\nbe issued instantly for the suppression of the monasteries and\r\nconvents. Henry VIII. and Cromwell were nothing loath to accede to\r\nthese demands, particularly as some of the Mendicants had been very\r\nzealous in defence of the rights of the Pope; and accordingly a royal\r\ncommission was addressed to the Archbishop of Dublin, John Alen\r\nChancellor, William Brabazon Vice-Treasurer, Robert Cowley Master of\r\nthe Rolls, and Thomas Cusake empowering them to undertake the work of\r\nsuppression (April 1539). \"From information of trustworthy persons,\"\r\nit was stated, \"it being manifestly apparent that the monasteries,\r\nabbies, priories and other places of religious or regulars in Ireland,\r\nare at present in such a state that in them the praise of God and the\r\nwelfare of man are next to nothing regarded; the regulars and nuns\r\ndwelling there being so addicted, partly to their own superstitious\r\nceremonies, partly to the pernicious worship of idols, and to the\r\npestiferous doctrines of the Romish Pontiff, that, unless an effective\r\nremedy be promptly provided, not only the weak lower order, but the\r\nwhole Irish people, may be speedily infected, to their total\r\ndestruction by such persons.\" To prevent such a calamity the king\r\nresolved to take into his hands the religious houses and to disband\r\nthe monks and nuns, for which purpose he commanded the commissioners\r\nto notify his wishes to the heads of the religious houses, to receive\r\ntheir resignations and surrender of their property, to offer to those\r\nwho surrendered willingly a benefice or a pension, and \"to apprehend\r\nand punish such as adhere to the usurped authority of the Romish\r\nPontiff and contumaciously refuse to surrender their houses.\"[33] It\r\nshould be noted that from the terms of this commission it is clear\r\nthat no serious abuses or irregularities could have been charged\r\nagainst the religious houses, else in the decree condemning them to\r\nextinction something more serious would have been alleged to their\r\ncharge than adherence to their own superstitious ceremonies, to the\r\nworship of idols, and to the Roman Pontiff. A month later Alen,\r\nBrabazon, and Cowley were appointed to survey and value the rents and\r\nrevenues of the dissolved monasteries, to issue leases for twenty-one\r\nyears of both their spiritualities and temporalities, to reserve for\r\nthe king the plate, jewels, and ornaments, and to grant to the monks\r\nand nuns pensions for their maintenance.[34]\r\n\r\nAlthough many members of the privy council in Ireland had petitioned\r\nmore than once for such a commission, yet when rumours reached Dublin\r\nthat it had been granted, a request was forwarded from the council to\r\nCromwell begging him to spare St. Mary's Abbey Dublin, Christ's\r\nChurch, Grace-Dieu, Conall, Kells (Co. Kilkenny), and Jerpoint, on the\r\nground amongst others that \"in them young men and children, both\r\ngentlemen children and others both of man kind and woman kind, be\r\nbrought up in virtue, learning and in the English tongue and\r\nbehaviour, to the great charge of the said houses; that is to say, the\r\nwoman kind of the whole Englishry of this land, for the more part, in\r\nthe said nunnery, and the man kind in the other said houses.\"[35] This\r\npetition received but scant consideration, and no wonder; because,\r\nalthough the Archbishop of Dublin had agreed to it, he wrote on the\r\nsame day to Cromwell asking him for the lands of Grace-Dieu,[36] and,\r\naccording to a letter addressed to Cromwell by another prominent Irish\r\nofficial, the Deputy at that very time \"had obtained from the abbot of\r\nSt. Mary's leases of all the good lodgings in the monastery, and of\r\nthe farms of Ballyboghill and Portmarnock on an agreement evidently\r\nmeant to defraud the king.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had the commission been received than Browne and his companions\r\nwent to work in good earnest to carry out the task entrusted to them.\r\nThe superiors of most of the monasteries and convents situated within\r\nthe Pale or in the territories dominated by the Ormond faction\r\nsurrendered their houses at the first summons. Not even the Abbey of\r\nSt. Mary's, which petitioned for mercy on the ground that it kept open\r\nhouse for poor men, scholars, and orphans, was spared,[37] nor the\r\npriory of Conall, which boasted that though it lay among the wild\r\nIrish it had never any brethren unless they belonged to the \"very\r\nEnglish nation.\"[38] During the years 1539, 1540, and 1541 nearly all\r\nthe monasteries and convents in the territories within the\r\njurisdiction of the king were suppressed. Amongst the communities and\r\ninstitutions that suffered were St. Mary's and the Abbey of St. Thomas\r\nthe Martyr, the Carmelite, Dominican and Franciscan houses of Dublin;\r\nthe Hospital of St. John and the Augustinians and Franciscans of Naas,\r\nthe Priories of Conall and Clane, the Hospital of Castledermott, the\r\nDominicans of Athy; the Franciscans of New Abbey, the Carmelites of\r\nCloncurry, the Abbey of Baltinglass, and the College of Maynooth, the\r\nPriory of St. John in Kilkenny together with the houses of the\r\nFranciscans, and Dominicans, and the Hospital for Lepers near the same\r\ncity, Jerpoint, Inistoge, Kells (Co. Kilkenny), the Carmelites of\r\nLeighlin Bridge, Knocktopher, Thurles, Clonmel, the Augustinians of\r\nCallan, Tipperary and Fethard, the Franciscans of Cashel and Clonmel,\r\nthe monastery of Duisk, Hore Abbey, Kilcool and Inislonagh, Mellifont,\r\nthe Abbey of the Blessed Virgin Mary near Trim, and of Kells, the\r\nPriories of St. Fechin at Fore, and of Mullingar, the Hospital of St.\r\nJohn of Jerusalem at Kilmainham, together with several other religious\r\nhouses at Louth, Dundalk, Drogheda, Waterford, and Carlow. At the same\r\ntime most of the convents within the English sphere of influence\r\nsurrendered their houses and possessions, amongst the last to do so\r\nbeing the celebrated convent of Grace-Dieu.[39]\r\n\r\nAs a rule whenever a house was suppressed a pension was assigned to\r\nthe superior, to be paid out of the tithes of some of the\r\necclesiastical livings in the gift of the monastery or priory. The\r\namount of the pension depended to some extent upon the value of the\r\nproperty which was owned by the particular house. The Abbot of St.\r\nThomas the Martyr's, Dublin, received £42 Irish, the Abbot of\r\nMellifont £40, the Prior of Fore £50, the Abbot of Jerpoint £10, the\r\nPrioress of Grace-Dieu £6, the Abbess of Grane £4, and the Prioress of\r\nTermonfechin £1 6s. 8d., etc. Grants were also made to the members of\r\nthe suppressed communities, but very frequently these were very small.\r\nOf the community of Mellifont one received £4, two £3 6s. 8d., two £2\r\n13s. 4d., six £2, and two £1, while five of the community at Granard\r\nreceived 13s. 4d., and some from other institutions received only 4s.\r\nMany of the superiors and religious merely threw off the habit of\r\ntheir order to become secular clergymen, and to accept a rectory or\r\nvicarage in some of the churches over which their community had\r\nenjoyed the rights of patronage.[40]\r\n\r\nLong before the commission for suppression arrived the scramble for a\r\nshare in the plunder had begun. In this contest the Deputy, Archbishop\r\nBrowne, and the principal members of the privy council led the way.\r\nJohn Alen, Master of the Rolls, was the first to profit by the\r\nspoliation of the religious houses by getting possession of the\r\nproperty of St. Wolstan's (1536), Lord Grey secured for himself the\r\ngoods and possessions of the Convent of Grane. The Earl of Ormond and\r\nthe Butler family generally enriched themselves out of the lands of\r\nthe monasteries situated in the south-eastern portion of Ireland, as\r\ndid also a host of hungry officials and gentlemen in different parts\r\nof Ireland, such as the Cowleys, Alens, St. Legers, Lutrells,\r\nPlunketts, Dillons, Nugents, Prestons, Berminghams, Townleys, Aylmers,\r\nFlemings, Wyses, Eustaces, Brabazons, etc.[41] Even Patrick Barnewall,\r\nwho had resisted so strenuously the suppression of the monasteries in\r\n1536, could not resist the temptation of sharing in the plunder. He\r\nsecured for himself a large portion of the lands and advowsons of the\r\nConvent of Grace-Dieu. In this way the Anglo-Irish nobles were bribed\r\ninto acquiescence with the king's religious policy, and were enabled\r\nto transmit to their descendants immense territories over which they\r\nwere to rule as hereditary landlords long after the origin of their\r\ntitle had been forgotten. Similarly, in order to put an end to the\r\nopposition of the city authorities, which had good ground to complain\r\nof the suppressions of houses that were doing so much in the cause of\r\ncharity and education, large grants were made to the corporations of\r\nDublin, Waterford, Limerick, Clonmel, etc. Wealthy merchants who had\r\nmoney to invest were not slow in coming forward to secure leases of\r\nportions of the monastic land and thereby to lay the foundations of a\r\nnew so-called aristocracy. The gold and silver ornaments, the sacred\r\nvessels, the bells, and the church plate generally were sold for the\r\nbenefit of the king, but the officials were never particularly careful\r\nabout making the proper returns. From a partial account given by the\r\ncommissioners in 1541 it appeared that from the sales of the jewels,\r\nreliquaries, pictures, and goods of the monasteries they had received\r\nover £2,500 (Irish) of which they had given close on £500 to the\r\nsuperiors, servants, etc., and retained £375 as travelling\r\nexpenses.[42] With the submission of the Earl of Desmond, O'Brien of\r\nThomond, O'Donnell, etc., a more determined campaign was initiated for\r\nthe total destruction of the religious houses, and particularly of\r\nthose belonging to the Mendicants, not merely in the Pale but\r\nthroughout Ireland. A special commission was issued (Aug. 1541) to the\r\nEarl of Desmond and others \"to take inventories of, to dissolve, and\r\nto put in safe custody, all religious houses in Limerick, Cork, Kerry,\r\nand Desmond.\" In return for his activity the Earl of Desmond was\r\nrewarded with several grants of monastic land, and even O'Brien did\r\nnot think it beneath him to share in the plunder. In some places, as\r\nfor instance in Monaghan, the Franciscan Friars were put to death. But\r\nin the Irish districts generally the decree of suppression was not\r\nenforced, and even in the English portions of the country the\r\nsuppression of the monasteries did not mean the extinction of the\r\nmonks. The Franciscans and Dominicans in particular seem to have been\r\nalmost as numerous at the end of the reign of Henry VIII. as they had\r\nbeen before he undertook his campaign against Rome.\r\n\r\nThe whole story of these sad years is summarised in a striking if\r\nslightly exaggerated fashion by the Four Masters. \"A heresy and new\r\nerror,\" they say, \"sprang up in England through pride, vain-glory,\r\navarice, and list, and through many strange sciences, so that the men\r\nof England went into opposition to the Pope and to Rome. . . . They\r\nstyled the king the chief head of the Church of God in his own\r\nkingdom. New laws and statutes were enacted by the king and council\r\naccording to their own will. They destroyed the orders to whom worldly\r\npossessions were allowed, namely, the Monks, Canons, Nuns, the\r\nCrouched Friars, and the four Mendicant Orders, namely the Friars\r\nMinor, the Friars Preachers, the Carmelites, and the Augustinians, and\r\nthe lordships and livings of all these were seized for the king. They\r\nbroke down the monasteries and sold their roofs and their bells, so\r\nthat from Aran of the Saints to the Iccian See there was not one\r\nmonastery that was not broken and shattered, with the exception of a\r\nfew in Ireland, of which the English took no notice or heed. They\r\nafterward burned the images, shrines, and relics of the saints of\r\nIreland and England; they likewise burned the celebrated image of Mary\r\nat Trim, which used to perform wonders and miracles, to heal the\r\nblind, the deaf, the crippled, and persons affected with all kinds of\r\ndisease; they burned the Staff of Jesus, which was in Dublin, and\r\nwhich wrought miracles from the time of St. Patrick, and had been in\r\nthe hands of Christ while He was among men. They also appointed\r\narchbishops and bishops for themselves, and though great was the\r\npersecution of the Roman emperors against the Church, scarcely had\r\nthere ever come so great a persecution from Rome as this, so that it\r\nis impossible to narrate or tell its description unless it should be\r\nnarrated by one who saw it.\"[43] The Annalists might have added a fact\r\nnoticed by a distinguished Protestant historian that \"instead of\r\nbestowing their [of the monasteries] incomes on the amelioration of\r\nthe Church, or expending them in providing for the religious or\r\nsecular improvement of the people in any other way, caring little\r\napparently for the impoverishment of the Church, he [Henry VIII.]\r\nmisapplied those revenues for the purposes of promoting his own\r\ngratification or enriching his favourites.\"[44]\r\n\r\nVery early in his reign Henry VIII. had dreamt of the complete\r\nsubjugation of Ireland, but it was only after the successful overthrow\r\nof the Geraldine Rebellion (1534-5) that the realisation of these\r\ndreams seemed to be within measurable reach. The boldness and military\r\ngenius of Lord Leonard Grey bade fair to bring all Ireland within the\r\nsphere of English jurisdiction, until the religious crisis arose to\r\ncomplicate the issues. Many of the Irish princes took offence at the\r\ndoctrine of royal supremacy, the attack on images, pictures,\r\npilgrimages, relics, etc., and at the desperate efforts that were\r\nbeing made to drive out entirely the monks and nuns. During the years\r\n1537 and 1538 rumours of a great confederation reached the ears of the\r\nEnglish officials. It was represented that Con O'Neill, Manus\r\nO'Donnell, O'Brien of Thomond, the De Burgos of Connaught, and the\r\nEarl of Desmond had joined hands to protect the young Garrett\r\nFitzgerald and to defend the authority of the Pope. Messengers, it was\r\nsaid, were passing constantly from Ireland to Scotland, and from\r\nScotland to Rome. It was reported in 1539 that the Irish princes\r\nregarded Henry VIII. as a heretic, who had forfeited all title to the\r\nLordship of Ireland, that they were determined to uphold the authority\r\nof the Pope, that they expected help from the Emperor, from France,\r\nand from Scotland, and that if an invasion were attempted not even the\r\nAnglo-Irish of the Pale could be relied upon on account of their\r\nattachment to the Pope and to the Geraldines.[45]\r\n\r\nBut the successful expeditions against both the North and South\r\nundertaken by the Deputy in 1539 seems to have put an end to all\r\nconcerted defence, and to have reduced the Irish princes to a state of\r\nutter helplessness. One after another they hastened to make their\r\nsubmission, to accept titles and honours and money from the king, and\r\nto consent to hold their territories by royal patent. Already in 1534\r\nthe Earl of Ormond had accepted the religious policy of Henry VIII. in\r\nthe hope of scoring a triumph over his old rivals, the Geraldines.\r\nThree years later (1537) MacGillapatrick of Ossory promised faithfully\r\nto abolish the usurped jurisdiction of the Pope, to have the English\r\nlanguage spoken in his territories, and to send his son to be brought\r\nup with a knowledge of the English language and customs. In return for\r\nthis he received a royal grant of his land and possessions, was\r\ncreated Baron of Colthill and Castleton, and was promised a seat in\r\nthe House of Lords, a favour which he obtained in 1543, when he was\r\nappointed a peer[46] with the title of Baron of Upper Ossory. Brian\r\nO'Connor of Offaly and his rival Cahir made their submission in March\r\n1538. They renounced the jurisdiction of the Pope, agreed to hold\r\ntheir lands from the king, and to abandon all claims to tribute or\r\nblack rent from their neighbours of the Pale. Brian O'Connor was\r\ncreated Baron of Offaly. He was followed in his submission by the Earl\r\nof Desmond (1541), MacWilliam Burke, O'Brien of Thomond, Manus\r\nO'Donnell (Aug. 1541) and finally by Con O'Neill (1542). All these,\r\ntogether with a host of minor chieftains and dependents, renounced the\r\nauthority of the Pope, accepted re-grants of their lands from the\r\nking, begged for English titles, and did not think it beneath their\r\ndignity to accept gifts of money and robes. Con O'Neill became Earl of\r\nTyrone, his son Matthew Baron of Dungannon, O'Brien Earl of Thomond,\r\nhis nephew Donogh Baron of Ibricken, MacWilliam Burke Earl of\r\nClanrickard, while knighthoods were distributed freely among the\r\nlesser nobles.[47] Although there may have existed in the minds of the\r\nIrish chieftains a certain amount of confusion about the temporal and\r\nspiritual jurisdiction of the Pope, especially as the Popes seem to\r\nhave claimed a peculiar sovereignty in Ireland, yet it is impossible\r\nto suppose that they could have acted in good faith in signing the\r\ndocuments of submission to which they attached their signatures. That\r\nthey recognised the dangerous and heretical tendencies of Henry's\r\nreligious policy is evident enough from the correspondence of the\r\nyears 1537-39, and that they never made any serious efforts to carry\r\nout the terms of these agreements must be admitted. It is quite\r\npossible that like the noblemen of England they were personally\r\nwilling to acquiesce in Henry VIII.'s religious policy for the sake of\r\nsecuring good terms for themselves, but that they found it impossible\r\nto do anything on account of the opposition of the vast body of the\r\npeople. Henry VIII. recognised that he was not in a position to\r\nenforce his authority in case of O'Brien, O'Donnell, O'Neill,\r\nMacWilliam Burke, etc., and hence he advised his officials to seek to\r\nwin these over by kindness and persuasion rather than by force. In\r\nparticular they were to endeavour \"to persuade them discreetly\" to\r\nsuppress the religious houses in their territories, but at the same\r\ntime no attempt was to be made \"to press them overmuch in any vigorous\r\nsort.\"[48] O'Brien of Thomond and Desmond were not unwilling to share\r\nin the plunder of the monasteries, but as a rule the condition of\r\naffairs as regards religion was but slightly affected by the\r\nsubmissions of the chieftains.\r\n\r\nThe new Deputy, Anthony St. Leger (1540), was well fitted to profit by\r\nthe military successes of Lord Grey. As a royal commissioner three\r\nyears before he had ample opportunity of knowing the condition of\r\nIreland, the characters of the principal leaders, and the inducements\r\nby which they might be tempted to acknowledge the authority of the\r\nKing of England. He relied upon diplomatic rather than military\r\npressure, and he was so completely successful that the privy council\r\ncould report in 1542 that Ireland was at peace. Already in 1537, Alen,\r\nthe Master of the Rolls, had called the attention of the royal\r\ncommissioners to the fact that many of the Irish regarded the Pope as\r\nthe temporal sovereign of Ireland and the King of England only as Lord\r\nof Ireland by virtue of the Papal authority, and advised them that\r\nHenry should be proclaimed King of Ireland by an Act of Parliament.\r\nThis advice was approved warmly by Staples, Bishop of Meath (1538),\r\nand was endorsed by the Deputy and council in a letter addressed to\r\nHenry VIII. in December 1540.[49] The suggestion was accepted by the\r\nking, who empowered St. Leger to summon a Parliament to give it effect\r\n(1541).\r\n\r\nParliament met in June 1541. How many members attended the House of\r\nCommons or what particular districts were represented is not known for\r\ncertain; but in all probability it was only from the eastern and\r\nsouthern counties and cities that deputies were appointed. In the\r\nHouse of Lords there were present two archbishops together with twelve\r\nbishops, the Earls of Ormond and Desmond, and a number of viscounts,\r\nlords and barons, nearly all of whom belonged to the Anglo-Irish\r\nfaction. O'Brien of Thomond did not attend, but he sent deputies to\r\nrepresent him; O'Donnell and O'Neill held themselves aloof from the\r\nproceedings; and Donogh O'Brien, MacWilliam Burke, Cahir MacArt\r\nKavanagh, O'Reilly, Phelim Roe O'Neill of Clandeboy, and Kedagh O'More\r\nattended in person, but were not allowed to take an active part in the\r\nproceedings or to vote.[50] A bill was introduced by St. Leger\r\nbestowing on Henry VIII. the title of King of Ireland, and was read\r\nthree times in the House of Lords in one day. The next day it was\r\npassed by the House of Commons. It was agreed that the monarch should\r\nbe styled \"Henry VIII. by the Grace of God King of England, France,\r\nand Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of England, and\r\nalso of Ireland, on earth the Supreme Head.\" The proclamation, it was\r\nreported, was received with joyous acclamation in Dublin, where a\r\nmodified general amnesty was declared in honour of the happy event.\r\nThe report of what had taken place produced undoubtedly a great effect\r\non those princes who still held aloof, so that before the end of the\r\nyear 1542 even Con O'Neill had made an ignominious peace with the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhile the questions of royal supremacy and the jurisdiction of the\r\nPope were being debated in Parliament (1536-7) the bishops and\r\nproctors of the clergy incurred the wrath of Browne and the English\r\nofficials generally by their courageous resistance to the new\r\nproposals, showing thereby that they had no sympathy with the anti-\r\nRoman measures. Nor is there any reason to suppose that any\r\nconsiderable body of them adopted a different attitude, though the\r\nsubmission of their English brethren could not have failed to produce\r\nsome effect on them, particularly as some of them were Englishmen\r\nthemselves, and many of them must have received their education at\r\nsome of the English universities. In addition to Browne, who boasted\r\nof being only \"a king's bishop,\" the only men who can be proved to\r\nhave taken an active part in propagating the new views were Edmund\r\nStaples of Meath and Richard Nangle, the bishop whom Henry VIII.\r\nendeavoured to intrude into Clonfert (1536). The former of these was\r\nan Englishman appointed by the Pope (1529) at the request of Henry\r\nVIII. As might have been expected he took the side of the king against\r\nthe Earl of Kildare, and when the struggle began in Ireland between\r\nthe friends and the opponents of royal supremacy in Ireland he joined\r\nthe former. Like so many of the other Reformers he showed his anxiety\r\nfor the gospel by taking to himself a wife and by appropriating for\r\nhis own use the goods of the Church, but there is no evidence that his\r\nefforts produced any effect on the great body of his clergy. Richard\r\nNangle of Clonfert found himself opposed by Roland de Burgo, the\r\nbishop provided by the Pope to the See of Clonfert (Feb. 1539) Browne\r\nannounced that he intended personally to carry the light of the gospel\r\nwherever English was understood, and that he had secured a suffragan\r\nin the person of Dr. Nangle, Bishop of Clonfert, to set forth God's\r\nWord and the king's cause in the Irish tongue.[51] Owing to the state\r\nof open hostility existing between Browne and Staples the archbishop\r\ndid not regard the latter as a fellow-labourer. But evidently at this\r\nperiod these were the only three bishops on whom any reliance could be\r\nplaced by Henry VIII. Similarly in a document drawn up in 1542\r\nentitled /Certain Devices for the Reformation of Ireland/, Browne and\r\nStaples alone were mentioned as favouring the gospel or as capable of\r\n\"instructing the Irish bishops of this realm, causing them to\r\nrelinquish and renounce all popish or papistical doctrine, and to set\r\nforth within each of their dioceses the true Word of God.\"[52]\r\n\r\nBut though none of the Irish bishops appointed by the Pope, with the\r\nsingle exception of Staples of Meath, took any active steps to assist\r\nthe king, few of them entered the lists boldly in defence of the Roman\r\nSee, and many of them, like their English brethren, tried to temporise\r\nin the hope that the storm might soon blow past.[53] Edmund Butler,\r\nthe illegitimate son of Sir Piers Butler, afterwards Earl of Ormond,\r\nseems to have joined with the rest of his family in acknowledging\r\nroyal supremacy. He took a seat in the privy council, acted as\r\nintermediary between the government and the Earl of Desmond, signed as\r\na witness the document by which the latter renounced the authority of\r\nthe Pope, accepted for himself portions of the property of the\r\nsuppressed Franciscan Friary at Cashel, and was present at the\r\nParliament of 1541.[54] Hugh O'Cervallen of Clogher was appointed by\r\nthe Pope in 1535, but he went to London in 1542 as chaplain to Con\r\nO'Neill, surrendered his Bulls of appointment, took the oath\r\nproscribed by Henry VIII., and accepted a grant by royal patent of his\r\ndiocese, together with a pension of £40 a year.[55] Needless to say he\r\nwas repudiated by the Pope, who appointed another to take his place,\r\nand was driven from his See. John Quinn of Limerick was reported by\r\nLord Grey to have taken the oath of royal supremacy in 1538,[56] but\r\nthe Deputy's leanings towards Rome even on this journey were\r\nproclaimed so frequently by his opponents on the council that it would\r\nbe difficult to believe him, did not the name of the Bishop of\r\nLimerick appear amongst the witnesses to the submission of the Earl of\r\nDesmond.[57] Though his attitude at this period was at least doubtful,\r\nit is certain that he stood loyal to Rome once he discovered the\r\nschismatical tendency of the new movement, since it was found\r\nnecessary by the government to attempt to displace him in 1551 by the\r\nappointment of one who was likely to be more pliable.\r\n\r\nThe fact that some of the bishops surrendered the religious houses of\r\nwhich they were commendatory priors, as for example, Edmund Nugent of\r\nKilmore, Milo Baron of Ossory, and Walter Wellesley of Kildare,[58]\r\nand accepted pensions from the king as a compensation for the loss\r\nthey sustained by the suppression of the monasteries, creates a grave\r\nsuspicion of their orthodoxy, though it does not prove that they\r\naccepted royal supremacy. Baron was undoubtedly in close communication\r\nwith the government officials, and Nugent seems to have been removed\r\nby the Pope. Again, several of the bishops, Roland de Burgo of\r\nClonfert, Florence Kirwan of Clonmacnoise, Eugene MacGuinness of Down\r\nand Connor, and Thady Reynolds of Kildare[59] surrendered the Bulls\r\nthey had received from Rome, and accepted grants of their dioceses\r\nfrom the king. Such a step, however, affords no decisive evidence of\r\ndisloyalty to the Holy See. For years a sharp controversy had been\r\nwaged between the Kings of England and the Pope regarding the\r\ntemporalities of bishoprics. The Popes claimed to have the right of\r\nappointment to both the spiritualities and the temporalities, and gave\r\nexpression to these claims in the Bulls of appointment. The kings on\r\ntheir part asserted their jurisdiction over the temporalities, and to\r\nsafeguard their rights they insisted that the bishop-elect should\r\nsurrender the papal grant in return for a royal grant. Such a custom\r\nwas well known before any schismatical tendencies had made themselves\r\nfelt in England, and compliance with it would not prove that the\r\nbishops involved looked upon the king as the source of their spiritual\r\njurisdiction. The main point to be considered in case of the bishops\r\nwho surrendered their monasteries or their Bulls is what kind of oath,\r\nif any, were they obliged to take. If they consented to swear the form\r\nof renunciation prescribed for Irish bishops by the king their\r\northodoxy could not well be defended, but it is possible that, as\r\nHenry VIII. did not wish to press matters to extremes with the Irish\r\nprinces, he may have adopted an equally prudent policy in case of the\r\nbishops, and contented himself with the oath of allegiance.\r\n\r\nFully cognisant of the importance of winning the bishops to his side,\r\nHenry VIII. took care to appoint his own nominees as soon as a vacancy\r\noccurred. By doing so he hoped to secure the submission of the clergy\r\nand people, and to obtain for himself the fees paid formerly to Rome.\r\nDuring the ten years, between 1536 and 1546, he appointed Dominic\r\nTirrey to Cork, Richard Nangle to Clonfert, Christopher Bodkin,\r\nalready Bishop of Kilmacduagh to Tuam, Alexander Devereux to Ferns,\r\nWilliam Meagh to Kildare, Richard O'Ferral, late prior of Granard to\r\nArdagh, Aeneas O'Hernan (or O'Heffernan), late preceptor of Aney, to\r\nEmly, George Dowdall, late prior of Ardee, to Armagh, Conat\r\nO'Siaghail, a chaplain of Manus O'Donnell to Elphin, and Cornelius\r\nO'Dea, a chaplain of O'Brien of Thomond, to Killaloe. Though there can\r\nbe little doubt that some of these received their appointments as a\r\nreward for their acceptance of royal supremacy, it is difficult to\r\ndetermine how far they were committed to the religious policy of Henry\r\nVIII. It is certain that none of them, with the possible exception of\r\nNangle, took an active part in favouring the cause of the Reformation\r\nin Ireland once they understood the real issues at stake, and that the\r\nfact of their being opposed in every single case by a lawful bishop\r\nappointed by the Pope rendered it impossible for them to do much,\r\nhowever willing they might have been to comply with the wishes of the\r\nking.[60]\r\n\r\nDuring this critical period in Irish history Pope Paul III. was in\r\nclose correspondence with several of the Irish bishops and lay\r\nprinces. Time and again the officials in Ireland complain of the\r\n\"Rome-runners,\" of the provisions made by the Pope to Irish\r\nbishoprics, of the messengers passing to and fro between Ireland and\r\nRome, and of the Pope's co-operation in organising the Geraldine\r\nLeague in 1538 and 1539. It should be noted, however, that the silly\r\nletter attributed by Robert Ware to Paul III., wherein he is supposed\r\nto have warned O'Neill that he and his councillors in Rome had\r\ndiscovered from a prophecy of St. Laserian that whenever the Church in\r\nIreland should fall the Church of Rome should fall also, is a pure\r\nforgery published merely to discredit the Pope and the Roman See.[61]\r\nUndoubtedly Paul III. was gravely concerned about the progress of a\r\nmovement that threatened to involve Ireland in the English schism, and\r\nwas anxious to encourage the bishops and princes to stand firm in\r\ntheir resistance to royal supremacy. In 1539 reports reached Rome that\r\nGeorge Cromer, the Archbishop of Armagh, who had resisted the measures\r\ndirected against the Pope during the years 1536-38, had yielded, and\r\nas a result the administration of the See was committed (1539) to\r\nRobert Wauchope, a distinguished Scotch theologian then resident in\r\nRome. What proofs were adduced in favour of Cromer's guilt are not\r\nknown, but it is certain that the official correspondence of the\r\nperiod will be searched in vain for any evidence to show that Cromer\r\naccepted either in theory or in practice the ecclesiastical headship\r\nof Henry VIII. He held aloof from the meetings of the privy council,\r\nnever showed the slightest sympathy with the action of the Archbishop\r\nof Dublin, and though his name appears on some of the lists of the\r\nspiritual peers in the Parliament of 1541, the official report of St.\r\nLeger makes it certain that he did not attend.[62] It is quite\r\npossible that the Archbishop did not find himself in agreement with\r\nthe political schemes whereby the Irish princes and the King of\r\nScotland were to join hands for the overthrow of English authority in\r\nIreland, and on this account the King of Scotland was desirous of\r\nhaving him removed to make way for his agent at the Roman Court.\r\n\r\nThe new administrator of Armagh, Robert Wauchope, though suffering\r\nfrom weak sight, was recognised as one of the ablest theologians of\r\nhis day. He took a prominent part in the religious conference at Worms\r\n(1540) and at the Diet of Ratisbon (1541). He attended the Council of\r\nTrent during its earlier sessions, and rendered very valuable\r\nassistance, particularly in connexion with the decrees on\r\nJustification. The date of his consecration cannot be determined with\r\ncertainty. Probably he was not consecrated until news of the death of\r\nCromer (1543) reached Rome. In 1549 he set out for Scotland, and\r\napparently landed on the coast of Donegal in the hope of inducing\r\nO'Neill and O'Donnell to co-operate with the French and the Scots. His\r\nefforts were not, however, crowned with success. Finding himself\r\ndenounced to the government by O'Neill and by George Dowdall, who had\r\nbeen appointed to the See of Armagh by the king, he returned to Rome\r\nwhere he was granted faculties as legate to Ireland, but he died in a\r\nfew months before he could make any attempt to regain possession of\r\nhis diocese.[63] Before the death of Cromer Henry VIII., against the\r\nwishes of some members of his council in Ireland, who favoured the\r\nnomination of the son of Lord Delvin, had selected George Dowdall,\r\nlate prior of Ardee, to succeed him in Armagh. Dowdall went to London,\r\nin company with Con O'Neill, and received from the king a yearly\r\npension of £20 together with the promise of the Archbishopric of\r\nArmagh.[64] Though he must have given satisfactory assurances to the\r\nking on the question of royal supremacy, Dowdall was still in his\r\nheart a supporter of Rome, and as shall be seen, he left Ireland for a\r\ntime rather than agree to the abolition of the Mass and the other\r\nsweeping religious innovations that were undertaken in the reign of\r\nEdward VI.[65]\r\n\r\nAt the urgent request of Robert Wauchope Paul III. determined to send\r\nsome of the disciples of St. Ignatius to Ireland to encourage the\r\nclergy and people to stand firm in defence of their religion. St.\r\nIgnatius himself drew up a set of special instructions for the\r\nguidance of those who were selected for this important mission. The\r\ntwo priests appointed for the work, Paschasius Broet and Alphonsus\r\nSalmeron, together with Franciscus Zapata who offered to accompany\r\nthem, reached Scotland early in February 1541, and, having fortified\r\nthemselves by letters of recommendation from the King of Scotland\r\naddressed to O'Neill and others, they landed in Ireland about the\r\nbeginning of Lent. Their report speaks badly for the religious\r\ncondition of the country at the period. They could not help noting the\r\nfact that all the great princes, with one exception, had renounced the\r\nauthority of the Pope and had refused to hold any communications with\r\nthem, that the pastors had neglected their duty, and that the people\r\nwere rude and ignorant, though at the same time not unwilling to\r\nlisten to their instructions. In many particulars this unfavourable\r\nreport was well founded, especially in regard to the nobles, but it\r\nshould be remembered that these Jesuits remained only a few weeks in\r\nthe country, that they were utterly unacquainted with the manners and\r\ncustoms of the people, and that it would have been impossible for them\r\nto have obtained reliable information about the religious condition of\r\nIreland in the course of such a short visit. It should be noted, too,\r\nthat they placed the responsibility for the failure of their mission\r\non the King of Scotland who failed to stand by his promises.[66]\r\n\r\nDuring the last years of Henry VIII.'s reign St. Leger continued his\r\nefforts to reduce the country to subjection not by force but by\r\npersuasion. The religious issue was not put forward prominently, and\r\nwith the exception of grants of monastic lands and possessions very\r\nlittle seems to have been done. The Deputy's letters contain glowing\r\nreports of his successes. In the course of the warm controversy that\r\nraged between him and John Alen, the Chancellor, during the years 1546\r\nand 1547, the various reports forwarded to England are sufficient to\r\nshow that outside the Pale the English authorities had made little\r\nprogress. Although St. Leger was able to furnish a striking testimony\r\nfrom the council as to his success, and although a letter was sent by\r\nthe Irish princes in praise of Henry VIII.[67] (1546), proofs are not\r\nwanting that Henry's policy had met with only partial success.\r\nAccording to a letter sent by Archbishop Browne in 1546 the Irish\r\npeople were not reconciled to English methods of government, and\r\naccording to the chancellor, the king's writ did not run in the Irish\r\ndistricts. The Irishmen who pretended to submit did not keep to their\r\nsolemn promises. They still followed their own native laws regardless\r\nof English statutes, and the king could not get possession of the\r\nabbeys or abbey lands situated within their territories. Even the\r\ncouncil, which sought to defend the Deputy against these attacks, was\r\nforced to admit that his Majesty's laws were not current in the Irish\r\ndistricts.[68] One of the last steps taken by the council at the\r\nsuggestion of Henry VIII. was the appointment of a vice-regent in\r\nspirituals for the clergy, to grant dispensations as they were granted\r\nin England by Cranmer, so as to prevent the Irish from having recourse\r\nto Rome for such grants.[69]\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. died with the knowledge that he had done more than any of\r\nhis predecessors for the subjugation of Ireland. \"The policy that was\r\ndevised,\" writes Cusacke, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, \"for the sending\r\nof the Earls of Desmond, Thomond, Clanrickard, and Tyrone, and the\r\nBaron of Upper Ossory, O'Carroll, MacGennis, and others into England,\r\nwas a great help of bringing those countries to good order; for none\r\nof them who went into England committed harm upon the King's Majesty's\r\nsubjects. The winning of the Earl of Desmond was the winning of the\r\nrest of Munster with small charges. The making of O'Brien an Earl made\r\nall that country obedient. The making of MacWilliam Earl of\r\nClanrickard made all that country during his time obedient as it is\r\nnow. The making of MacGillapatrick Baron of Upper Ossory hath made his\r\ncountry obedient; and the having their lands by Dublin is such a gage\r\nupon them as they will not forfeit the same through wilful folly.\"[70]\r\nAs far as religion was concerned, however, there was very little\r\nchange. The Mass was celebrated and the Sacraments were administered\r\nas before. Here and there some of the bishops and clergy might have\r\nbeen inclined to temporise on the question of royal supremacy, but\r\nwhatever documents they might have signed, or whatever appointments\r\nthey might have accepted from Henry's agents, the vast body of the\r\nprinces, bishops, clergy, and people had no desire to separate\r\nthemselves from the universal Church. Henry VIII. had, however,\r\nrendered unintentionally an immense service to religion in Ireland by\r\npreparing the way for the destruction of royal interference in\r\nepiscopal and other ecclesiastical appointments and of the terrible\r\nabuse of lay patronage that had been the curse of the Catholic Church\r\nin Ireland for centuries. All these abuses having been transferred to\r\nthe small knot of English officials and Anglo-English residents, who\r\ncoalesced to form the Protestant sect, the Catholic Church was at last\r\nfree to pursue her peaceful mission without let or hindrance from\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Edward VI. made no notable change in Irish affairs.\r\nThe Deputy, St. Leger, was retained in office, as were also most of\r\nthe old officials. Some new members, including George Dowdall,\r\nArchbishop of Armagh, were added to the council, and arrangements were\r\nmade for the collection of the revenues from the suppressed\r\nmonasteries and religious houses. A royal commission was issued to the\r\nDeputy, the Lord Chancellor, and the Bishop of Meath to grant\r\nfaculties and dispensations in as ample a manner as the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. From the terms of this commission it is clear that the\r\nroyal advisers were determined to derive some financial profit from\r\nthe royal supremacy. The fee for dispensations for solemnising\r\nmarriage without the proclamation of the banns was fixed at 6s. 8d.\r\n(about £3 4s.), for marriage within the prohibited times at 10s., for\r\nmarriage within the prohibited times and without banns at 13s. 4d.,\r\nand for marriages to be celebrated without the parish church of the\r\ncontracting parties at 5s.[71] Similarly, an order was sent that the\r\nplate and ornaments of St. Patrick's Cathedral should be dispatched by\r\nsome trustworthy messenger to Bristol, there to be delivered to the\r\ntreasurer of the mint. This command must not have been carried out\r\ncompletely, because seven months later (Jan. 1548) the Dean of St.\r\nPatrick's was requested to deliver over for the use of the mint the\r\n\"one thousand ounces of plate of crosses and such like things\" that\r\nremained in his hands.[72]\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of Edward's reign the Protector set himself to\r\noverthrow the Catholic Church in Ireland by suppressing the Mass and\r\nenforcing the Lutheran or rather the Calvinist teaching regarding\r\nTransubstantiation and the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.\r\nThe /Injunctions/ of Edward VI. and the /Homilies/ of Cranmer were\r\ndispatched for the guidance of the Archbishop of Dublin, and of those\r\nwho, like him, were supposed to favour religious innovations. In like\r\nmanner the English Communion service (1548) and the First Book of\r\nCommon Prayer (1549) were made obligatory in those districts where the\r\nEnglish language was spoken or understood. As in England, the great\r\nsubject of controversy in Ireland during the early years of Edward's\r\nreign was the Blessed Eucharist. A Scotch preacher had been sent into\r\nIreland during the year 1548 to prepare the way for the abolition of\r\nthe Mass by attacking the Real Presence of Christ in the Sacrament of\r\nthe Altar. The Archbishop of Dublin, who had been noted previously for\r\nhis radical tendencies, objected to such doctrines, and complaints\r\nwere forwarded against him to the council. He was charged with having\r\nleased or otherwise disposed of the greater portion of the property of\r\nhis diocese to his children and favourites, with having failed to set\r\nforth his Majesty's /Injunctions/ and /Homilies/, with having\r\ncalumniated the Deputy and held secret communications with the Earl of\r\nDesmond and other Irish princes, and with having neglected to preach a\r\nsingle sermon between November 1547 and September 1548, when he took\r\noccasion to inveigh against the Scotch preacher who condemned \"the\r\nabuse of the Bishop of Rome's masses and ceremonies.\"[73] About the\r\nsame time the Deputy felt obliged to reprove the Treasurer of Christ's\r\nChurch for having refused to allow the English Communion Service to be\r\nfollowed in that church, and to warn him of the punishment in store\r\nfor him if he persisted in his obstinacy.\r\n\r\nBut if Browne were somewhat backward in adapting himself to the new\r\ntheories, his rival, Staples of Meath, who had prided himself hitherto\r\non his conservative tendencies, hastened to the relief of the\r\ngovernment. He went to Dublin to support the Scotch preacher in his\r\nattack on the Mass and the Blessed Eucharist, but if we are to believe\r\nhis own story his stay in Dublin was hardly less agreeable than was\r\nthe welcome that awaited him on his return to Meath. His friends\r\nassured him that the country was up in arms against him. A lady, whose\r\nchild he had baptised and named after himself, sought to change the\r\nname of her baby, for she \"would not have him bear the name of a\r\nheretic.\" A gentleman would not permit his child to be confirmed by\r\none who had denied the Sacrament of the Altar. Many people who heard\r\nthat the bishop was going to preach at Navan the following Sunday\r\ndeclared their intention of absenting themselves lest they should\r\nlearn heresy. A clergyman of his own promotion came to him in tears,\r\nand having asked permission to speak his mind freely, informed him\r\nthat he was detested by the people since he had taken the side of the\r\nheretics and preached against the Eucharist and Saints, that the\r\ncurses poured out upon him were more numerous than the hairs of his\r\nhead, and that he would do well to take heed as his life was in\r\ndanger.[74]\r\n\r\nSir Edward Bellingham succeeded St. Leger as Deputy, and arrived in\r\nMay 1548. During the early months of his term of office he was busily\r\nengaged against the O'Connors of Offaly, the O'Carrolls, and others,\r\nwho threatened the Pale once more. His efforts were crowned with\r\nconsiderable success, and during the year 1549 he found himself in a\r\nposition to push forward with the religious campaign. From inquiries\r\nmade he learned that in all Munster, Thomond, Connaught, and Ulster\r\nthe monasteries and other religious establishments remained, and that\r\nthey followed still the old religious practices.[75] He wrote to the\r\nsecretary of the Protector asking him to inform his master of the lack\r\nof good shepherds in Ireland \"to illuminate the hearts of the flock of\r\nChrist with His most true and infallible word,\" taking care at the\r\nsame time to recommend the Protector to appoint the clergymen who had\r\nbeen brought over from England to vacant bishoprics, so that the\r\npublic funds might be relieved by the withdrawal of their pensions.\r\nThe mayor and corporation of Kilkenny were ordered to see that the\r\npriests of the city should assemble to meet the Deputy and members of\r\nthe council. They promised that all the clergy should be present\r\nwithout fail, but, as shall be seen, the instructions of Sir Edward\r\nBellingham and his colleagues produced but little effect even in the\r\nvery stronghold of the Ormonds (1549). Walter Cowley was sent on a\r\ncommission into the diocese of Cashel to \"abolish idolatry, papistry,\r\nthe Mass Sacrament and the like,\" but he complained that the\r\narchbishop, instead of being present to assist him, tarried in Dublin\r\nalthough he had been warned that his presence was required.[76] The\r\ntruth is that, though the archbishop, as one of the Butlers, was\r\nwilling to go to great lengths in upholding the policy of Edward VI.,\r\nhe had no intention of taking part in a campaign against the Mass or\r\nthe Blessed Eucharist.[77] The latter written by this prelate (Feb.\r\n1548), in which he praised highly the conduct of Walter Cowley, who\r\nplayed such a prominent part in the suppression of the monasteries and\r\nthe seizure of ecclesiastical property, is often quoted as a proof\r\nthat he was strongly in favour of the Reformation, but such a\r\nstatement could be made only by one who has failed to understand the\r\ndifference between Ormondism and Protestantism, and the relations of\r\nboth Cowley and the archbishop to the former.\r\n\r\nBellingham was recalled to England in 1549, and soon after his\r\ndeparture new disturbances broke out in Ireland. Desmond and O'Brien\r\nwere regarded as unreliable; a union between the two great rival\r\nfamilies of the Ormonds and the Desmonds was not improbable, and to\r\nmake matters worse, news arrived in Dublin that Robert Wauchope, the\r\npapal Archbishop of Armagh, had arrived in the North to bring about a\r\nleague between O'Donnell, O'Neill, the Scotch, and the French (1550).\r\nDowdall, who had been introduced into Armagh by royal authority,\r\nreported the presence of his rival in Innishowen, and O'Neill and\r\nManus O'Donnell pledged themselves to resist the invaders. The council\r\nhastened to thank the northern chieftains for their refusal to hold\r\ncorrespondence with the French emissaries, who had accompanied\r\nWauchope, and warned them that the French intended to reduce the Irish\r\nto a state of slavery, and that the French nobility were so savage and\r\nferocious that it would be much better to live under the Turkish yoke\r\nthan under the rule of France.[78]\r\n\r\nIn July 1550 St. Leger was sent once more as Deputy to Ireland. He was\r\ninstructed \"to set forth God's service according to our (the king's)\r\nordinances in English, in all places where the inhabitants, or a\r\nconvenient number of them, understand that tongue; where the\r\ninhabitants did not understand it, the English is to be translated\r\ntruly into the Irish tongue, till such time as the people might be\r\nbrought to understand English.\" But as usual the financial side of the\r\nReformation was not forgotten. The Deputy was commanded to give order\r\nthat no sale or alienation be made of any church goods, bells, or\r\nchantry and free chapel lands without the royal assent, and that\r\ninventories were to be made in every parish of such goods, ornaments,\r\njewels, and bells, of chantry or free chapel lands, and of all other\r\nlands given to any church, \"lest some lewd persons might embezzle the\r\nsame.\"[79] On his arrival in Dublin St. Leger found affairs in a very\r\nunsatisfactory condition. \"I never saw the land,\" he wrote, \"so far\r\nout of good order, for in the forts [there] are as many harlots as\r\nsoldiers, and [there was during] these three years no kind of divine\r\nservice, neither communion, nor yet other service, having but one\r\nsermon made in that space, which the Bishop of Meath made, who had so\r\nlittle reverence at that time, as he had no great haste since to\r\npreach there.\"[80] Rumours were once more afloat that the French and\r\nScotch were about to create a diversion in Ireland. A large French\r\nfleet was partially wrecked off the Irish coast, and some of the\r\nGeraldine agents in Paris boasted openly that the Irish princes were\r\ndetermined to \"either stand or die for the maintenance of religion and\r\nfor the continuance of God's service in such sort as they had received\r\nit from their fathers.\"[81]\r\n\r\nWhile St. Leger was not slow in taking measures to resist a foreign\r\ninvasion, he did not neglect the instructions he had received about\r\nintroducing the Book of Common Prayer in place of the Mass. He\r\nprocured several copies of the English service and sent them to\r\ndifferent parts of the country, but instead of having it translated\r\ninto Irish he had it rendered into Latin for the use of those\r\ndistricts which did not understand English, in the hope possibly that\r\nhe might thereby deceive the people by making them believe that it was\r\nstill the Mass to which they had been accustomed. Apparently, however,\r\nthe new liturgy met with a stubborn resistance. In Limerick, although\r\nthe city authorities were reported to be favourable, the Bishop, John\r\nQuinn, refused to give his consent to the proposed change, and\r\nthroughout the country generally the Deputy was forced to confess that\r\nit was hard to plant the new religion in men's minds. He requested\r\nthat an express royal command should be addressed to the people\r\ngenerally to accept the change, and that a special commission should\r\nbe given to himself to enforce the liturgy.[82]\r\n\r\nThe formal order for the introduction of the English service was\r\nforwarded to St. Leger in February 1551, and was promulgated in the\r\nbeginning of March. Bishop Quinn of Limerick was forced to resign the\r\ntemporalities of his See to make way for William Casey, who was\r\nexpected to be more compliant. A number of bishops and clergy were\r\nsummoned to meet in conference in Dublin to consider the change. At\r\nthis conference the reforming party met with the strongest opposition\r\nfrom the Primate of Armagh. Although George Dowdall had accepted the\r\nprimatial See from the hands of the king and had tried to unite\r\nloyalty to Rome and to Henry VIII., he had no intention of supporting\r\nan heretical movement having for its object the abolition of the Mass.\r\nFrom the very beginning of the Protector's rule he had adopted an\r\nattitude of hostility to the proposed changes, as is evident from the\r\nfriendly letter of warning addressed to him by the Lord Deputy\r\nBellingham.[83] The Primate defended steadfastly the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Bishop of Rome, and refused to admit that the king had any\r\nauthority to introduce such sweeping reforms by virtue of his office.\r\nFinding that his words failed to produce any effect on the Deputy he\r\nleft the conference, together with his suffragans, except Staples of\r\nMeath, and repaired to his own diocese to encourage the people and\r\nclergy to stand firm. St. Leger then handed the royal commission to\r\nBrowne, who declared that he submitted to the king \"as Jesus Christ\r\ndid to Caesar, in all things just and lawful, making no question why\r\nor wherefore, as we own him our true and lawful king.\"[84]\r\n\r\nThough St. Leger pretended to be a strong supporter of the new\r\nreligion, yet, according to Archbishop Browne, he contented himself\r\nwith the formal promulgation of the royal orders. He himself on his\r\narrival in Ireland assisted publicly at Mass in Christ's Church, \"to\r\nthe comfort of his too many like Papists, and to the discouragement of\r\nthe professors of God's word.\" He allowed the celebration of Mass,\r\nholy water, Candlemas candles, and such like to continue in the\r\ndiocese of the Primate and elsewhere without protest or punishment. He\r\nseemed, even, to take the side of the Primate at the council board,\r\nand sent a message to the Earl of Tyrone \"to follow the counsell and\r\nadvice of that good father, sage senator and godly bishop, my lord\r\nPrimate in everything.\" He went so far as to present the Archbishop of\r\nDublin with a number of books written in defence of the Mass and\r\nTransubstantiation, and when the archbishop ventured to remonstrate\r\nwith him on his want of zeal for God's word the only reply he received\r\nwas, \"Go to, go to, your matters of religion will mar all.\"[85] St.\r\nLeger's main object was the pacification of the country and the\r\nextension of English power, both of which, he well knew, would be\r\nendangered by any active campaign against the Mass.\r\n\r\nSt. Leger was recalled, and Sir James Crofts, who had been sent on a\r\nspecial commission to Ireland a few months earlier, was appointed\r\nDeputy in his place (April 1551). His instructions in regard to the\r\nBook of Common Prayer and the inventory of the confiscated church\r\nplate were couched in terms similar to those given to his\r\npredecessor.[86] Anxious from the beginning to conciliate Primate\r\nDowdall, he forwarded to him a respectful letter (June 1551) calling\r\nhis attention to the respect paid by Christ Himself and St. Peter to\r\nthe imperial authority, offering his services as mediator between the\r\nPrimate and his opponents, Browne and Staples, and warning him of the\r\nlikelihood of much more serious changes, which he (the Deputy) pledged\r\nhimself if possible to resist.[87] To this communication the Primate\r\nsent an immediate reply, in which he offered to meet his opponents in\r\nconference, though he could hold out no hope of agreement, as their\r\n\"judgments, opinions, and consciences were different.\"[88]\r\n\r\nThe conference took place at St. Mary's Abbey in the presence of the\r\nDeputy. The Archbishop of Dublin, Staples of Meath, and Thomas\r\nLancaster, who had been intruded into the See of Kildare by royal\r\nauthority, attended to defend the new teaching against the Primate.\r\nThe subjects discussed were the Mass and the Blessed Virgin. Staples\r\ntook the leading part on the side of the Reformers, and, as Dowdall\r\nhad anticipated, no agreement could be arrived at. The Primate\r\nappealed to the terms of the oath of loyalty to the Pope taken by both\r\nhimself and his opponents at their consecration, but Staples had no\r\ndifficulty in proclaiming that he refused to consider himself bound by\r\nthis oath. The meeting broke up without any result.[89] Dowdall,\r\nhaving forwarded a declaration to the Lord Chancellor that he could\r\nnever be bishop where the Holy Mass was abolished, fled from Ireland.\r\nBrowne wrote immediately to the Earl of Warwick beseeching him to\r\nconfer on Dublin all the primatial rights enjoyed hitherto by Armagh,\r\nwhile the Deputy sought for instructions about the vacant See of\r\nArmagh (Nov. 1551).[90] Dowdall was deprived of his diocese, and the\r\nPrimacy was transferred to Dublin (1551).\r\n\r\nStill Crofts was forced to admit that the Reformation was making but\r\nlittle progress in Ireland. The bishops and clergy gave him no\r\nsupport, and in spite of all he could do \"the old ceremonies\" were\r\ncontinued. He besought his friends in England to send over reliable\r\nmen from England to fill the vacant bishoprics and to set forth the\r\n\"king's proceeding,\" or if they could not do that, to send some\r\nlearned men to remain with him by whose counsel he might better direct\r\n\"the blind and obstinate bishops.\" The Sees of Armagh, Cashel, and\r\nOssory were then vacant, and, as the Deputy pointed out, it was of\r\nvital importance to the Reformers that reliable priests should be\r\nappointed. Cranmer nominated four clerics for the See of Armagh, from\r\nwhom the king selected Richard Turner, a vicar in Kent. But he\r\ndeclined the honour, preferring to run the risk of being hanged by\r\nrebels than to go to Armagh, where he should be obliged to \"preach to\r\nthe walls and the stalls, for the people understand no English.\"\r\nCranmer tried to re-assure him by reminding him \"that if he wilt take\r\nthe pains to learn the Irish tongue (which with diligence he may do in\r\na year or two) then both his doctrine shall be more acceptable not\r\nonly unto his diocese, but also throughout all Ireland.\"\r\nNotwithstanding this glorious prospect Turner remained obdurate in his\r\nrefusal, and at last Armagh was offered to and accepted by one Hugh\r\nGoodacre.[91] Cashel was, apparently, considered still more hopeless,\r\nand as nobody upon whom the government could rely was willing to take\r\nthe risk, the See was left vacant during the remainder of Edward VI.'s\r\nreign. Though Crofts was strongly in favour of the new religion, he\r\nhad the temerity to suggest that Thomas Leverous, the tutor and former\r\nprotector of the young heir of Kildare, should be appointed to Cashel\r\nor Ossory. \"For learning, discretion, and good living,\" he wrote, \"he\r\nis the meekest man in this realm, and best able to preach both in the\r\nEnglish and the Irish tongue. I heard him preach such a sermon as in\r\nmy simple opinion, I heard not in many years.\"[92]\r\n\r\nBut as Leverous was well known to be not only a Geraldine but also a\r\nstrong Papist the Deputy's recommendation was set at nought, and the\r\nSee of Ossory was conferred on John Bale. The latter was an\r\nex-Carmelite friar, who, according to himself, was won from the\r\nignorance and blindness of papistry by a temporal lord, although\r\naccording to others, \"his wife Dorothy had as great a hand in that\r\nhappy work as the Lord.\" On account of his violent and seditious\r\nsermons he was thrown into prison, from which he was released by\r\nCromwell, with whom he gained great favour by his scurrilous and\r\nabusive plays directed against the doctrines and practices of the\r\nChurch. On the fall of his patron in 1540 Bale found it necessary to\r\nescape with his wife and children to Germany, whence he returned to\r\nEngland after the death of Henry VIII. He was a man of considerable\r\nability, \"with little regard for truth if he could but increase the\r\nenemies of Popery,\" and so coarse and vulgar in his language and ideas\r\nthat his works have been justly described by one whose Protestantism\r\ncannot be questioned as a \"dunghill.\"[93]\r\n\r\nThe consecration of Goodacre and Bale was fixed for February 1553, and\r\nthe consecrating prelates were to be Browne, Lancaster, who had been\r\nintruded by the king into Kildare, and Eugene Magennis of Down. At the\r\nconsecration ceremony itself a peculiar difficulty arose. Although the\r\nFirst Book of Common Prayer had been legalised in Ireland by royal\r\nproclamation, the Ordinal and the Second Book of Common Prayer had\r\nnever been enforced by similar warrant, and their use was neither\r\nobligatory nor lawful. Bale demanded, however, that they should be\r\nfollowed. When the dean of Christ's Church insisted on the use of the\r\nRoman Ordinal, he was denounced by the bishop-elect as \"an ass-headed\r\ndean and a blockhead who cared only for his belly,\" and when Browne\r\nventured to suggest that the ceremony should be delayed until a\r\ndecision could be sought, he was attacked as \"an apicure,\" whose only\r\nobject was \"to take up the proxies of any bishopric to his own\r\ngluttonous use.\" The violence of Bale carried all before it even to\r\nthe concession of common bread for the Communion Service.[94]\r\n\r\nGoodacre was by English law the Archbishop of Armagh, but the\r\nthreatening attitude of Shane O'Neill prevented him from ever having\r\nthe pleasure of seeing his own cathedral. Bale was, however, more\r\nfortunate. He made his way to Kilkenny where he proceeded to destroy\r\nthe images and pictures in St. Canice's, and to rail against the Mass\r\nand the Blessed Eucharist, but only to find that his own chapter, the\r\nclergy, and the vast majority of the people were united in their\r\nopposition to him.\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] /State Papers Hen.

(6 July 1553) and the accession of Queen Mary\r\nput an end for the time being to the campaign against the Catholic\r\nChurch. The party of the Earl of Northumberland made a feeble attempt\r\nin Ireland, as they had done in England, to secure the succession for\r\nLady Jane Grey, but their efforts produced no effect. On the 20th July\r\nthe privy council in England sent a formal order for the proclamation\r\nof Queen Mary, together with an announcement that she had been\r\nproclaimed already in London as Queen of England, France, and Ireland,\r\nDefender of the Faith, and on earth Supreme Head of the Churches of\r\nEngland and Ireland.[1] This command was obeyed promptly in Dublin and\r\nin the chief cities in Ireland. In Kilkenny Lord Mountgarret and Sir\r\nRichard Howth ordered that a Mass of thanksgiving should be\r\ncelebrated, and when Bale refused to allow such idolatry they informed\r\nthe clergy that they were no longer bound to obey the bishop. Mary was\r\nproclaimed in Kilkenny (20 Aug.), and on the following day the clergy\r\nand people took possession of the Cathedral of St. Canice. Crowds of\r\nthe citizens proceeded to attack the palace of the bishop, so that it\r\nwas only with the greatest difficulty that the Mayor of Kilkenny was\r\nable to save his life by sending him to Dublin at night under the\r\nprotection of an armed escort. From Dublin Bale succeeded in making\r\nhis escape to Holland, from which he proceeded to Basle, where he\r\nspent his time in libelling the Catholic religion and the Irish clergy\r\nand people.\r\n\r\nShortly after the coronation of Queen Mary Sir Thomas St. Leger was\r\nsent over to Ireland as Deputy with instructions that he was to take\r\nsteps immediately for the complete restoration of the Catholic\r\nreligion. Primate Dowdall was recalled from exile, and restored to his\r\nSee of Armagh; the primacy, which had been taken from Armagh in the\r\nprevious reign owing to the hostile attitude adopted by Dowdall\r\ntowards the religious innovations, was restored, and various grants\r\nwere made to him to compensate him for the losses he had sustained.[2]\r\nIn April 1554 a royal commission was issued to Dowdall and William\r\nWalsh, formerly prior of the Cistercian Abbey of Bective, to remove\r\nthe clergy who had married from their benefices. In virtue of this\r\ncommission Browne of Dublin, Staples of Meath, Thomas Lancaster of\r\nKildare, and Travers, who had been intruded into the See of Leighlin,\r\nwere removed. Bale of Ossory had fled already, and Casey of Limerick\r\nalso succeeded in making his escape. O'Cervallen of Clogher, who had\r\nbeen deposed by the Pope, was driven from his diocese, and an inquiry\r\nwas set on foot at Lambeth Palace before Cardinal Pole to determine\r\nwho was the lawful Archbishop of Tuam. Christopher Bodkin, Bishop of\r\nKilmacduagh, had been appointed to Tuam by the king in 1536, while two\r\nyears later Arthur O'Frigil, a canon of Raphoe, received the same See\r\nby papal provision. At the inquiry before Cardinal Pole it was proved\r\nthat though Bodkin had contracted the guilt of schism he had done so\r\nmore from fear than from conviction, that he had been always a stern\r\nopponent of heresy, and that in the city and diocese of Tuam the new\r\nopinions had made no progress. Apparently, as a result of the inquiry,\r\nan agreement was arranged whereby Bodkin was allowed to retain\r\npossession of Tuam.[3] The other bishops were allowed to retain their\r\nSees without objection, a clear proof that their orthodoxy was\r\nunquestionable.\r\n\r\nIn place of those who had been deposed, Hugh Curwen, an Englishman,\r\nwas appointed to Dublin, William Walsh, one of the royal\r\ncommissioners, to Meath, Thomas Leverous, the former tutor of the\r\nyoung Garrett Fitzgerald, to Kildare, Thomas O'Fihil, an Augustinian\r\nHermit, to Leighlin, and John O'Tonory, a Canon Regular of St.\r\nAugustine, to Ossory, while John Quinn of Limerick, who had been\r\nforced to resign the See of Limerick during the reign of Edward VI.,\r\nwas apparently restored. The selection of Curwen to fill the\r\narchiepiscopal See of Dublin was particularly unfortunate. However\r\nlearned he might have been, or however distinguished his ancestry, he\r\nwas not remarkable for the fixity of his religious principles. During\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII. he had acquired notoriety by his public\r\ndefence of the royal divorce, as well as by his attacks on papal\r\nsupremacy, though, like Henry, he was a strong upholder of the Real\r\nPresence of Christ in the Eucharist, and of Transubstantiation. Like a\r\ntrue courtier he changed his opinions immediately on the accession of\r\nQueen Mary, and he was rewarded by being promoted to Dublin and\r\nappointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland (1555). The Cathedral Chapter of\r\nSt. Patrick's that had been suppressed was restored to \"its pristine\r\nstate;\" new dignitaries and canons were appointed, and much of the\r\npossessions that had been seized were returned.[4]\r\n\r\nThe Mass and Catholic ceremonies were restored without any opposition\r\nin those churches in Dublin and Leinster into which the English\r\nservice had been introduced. A provincial synod was held in Dublin by\r\nthe new archbishop (1556) to wipe out all traces of heresy and schism.\r\nPrimate Dowdall had convoked previously a synod of the Northern\r\nProvinces at Drogheda to undertake a similar work. In this assembly it\r\nwas laid down that all priests who had attempted to marry during the\r\ntroubles of the previous reign should be deprived of their benefices\r\nand suspended; that the clergy who had adopted the heretical rites in\r\nthe religious celebrations and in the administration of the Sacraments\r\nshould be admitted to pardon in case they repented of their crimes and\r\ncould prove that their fall was due to fear rather than conviction;\r\nthat all the ancient rites and ceremonies of the Church in regard to\r\ncrosses, images, candles, thuribles, canonical hours, Mass, the\r\nadministration of the sacraments, fast days, holidays, holy water, and\r\nblessed bread should be restored; that the Book of Common Prayer,\r\netc., should be burned, and that the Primate and the bishops of the\r\nprovince should appoint inquisitors in each diocese, to whom the\r\nclergy should denounce those who refused to follow the Catholic\r\nworship and ceremonies. Arrangements were also made to put an end to\r\nabuses in connexion with the bestowal of benefices on laymen and\r\nchildren, with the appointment of clerics to parishes and dignities by\r\nthe Holy See on the untrustworthy recommendation of local noblemen,\r\nwith the excessive fees charged by some of the clergy, with the\r\nneglect of those whose duty it was to contribute to the repairs of the\r\nparish churches, and with the failure of some priests to wear a\r\nbecoming clerical dress.[5]\r\n\r\nIn July 1556 Lord Fitzwalter was sent to Ireland as Deputy. \"Our said\r\nDeputy and Council,\" according to the royal instructions, \"shall by\r\ntheir own good example and all other good means to them possible,\r\nadvance the honour of Almighty God, the true Catholic faith and\r\nreligion, now by God's great goodness and special grace recovered in\r\nour realms of England and Ireland, and namely they shall set forth the\r\nhonour and dignity of the Pope's Holiness and Apostolic See of Rome,\r\nand from time to time be ready with our aid and secular force, at the\r\nrequest of all spiritual ministers and ordinaries there, to punish and\r\nrepress all heretics and Lollards, and their damnable sects, opinions,\r\nand errors.\" They were commanded, too, to assist the commissioners and\r\nofficials whom Cardinal Pole as papal legate intended to send shortly\r\nto make a visitation of the clergy and people of Ireland.[6] On the\r\narrival of the new Deputy in Dublin he went in state to Christ's\r\nChurch to assist at Mass, after the celebration of which he received\r\nthe sword of state from his predecessor before the altar, and took the\r\noath in presence of the archbishop. \"That done, the trumpets sounded\r\nand drums beat, and then the Lord Deputy kneeled down before the altar\r\nuntil the /Te Deum/ was ended.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe new Deputy was instructed to take measures for summoning a meeting\r\nof Parliament in the following year to give legal sanction to the\r\nrestoration of the Catholic religion, and to deal with the\r\necclesiastical property that had been seized. Possibly in the hope of\r\nsecuring some of these again for the Church a commission was issued to\r\nthe Archbishop of Dublin, the Bishop of Kildare, and a number of\r\nclerics and laymen \"to inquire concerning the chalices, crosses,\r\nornaments, bells, and other property belonging to the parish churches\r\nor chapels in the county of the city and county of Dublin and of sales\r\nmade thereof to any person or persons, the price, in whose hands they\r\nthen remained, and also in whose possession were the houses, lands,\r\nand tenements, belonging to those churches.\" Similar commissions were\r\nissued to others for the counties of Drogheda and Louth, Kildare,\r\nCarlow, Wexford, Kilkenny, Meath, Westmeath, Waterford, Tipperary,\r\nLimerick, Cork, and \"for the county of Connaught.\"[8]\r\n\r\nIn June 1557 the Irish Parliament met. A Bull of absolution from the\r\npenalties of heresy and schism was read by the Archbishop of Dublin on\r\nbended knees, while the Lord Deputy, officials, and members, both\r\nPeers and Commoners, knelt around him. When this ceremony was finished\r\nall retired to the cathedral, where the /Te Deum/ was sung in\r\nthanksgiving, and all pledged themselves as a sign of their sincere\r\nrepentance to abolish all the laws that had been passed against the\r\nHoly See. The acts prejudicial to the rights of the Pope enacted since\r\nthe year 1529 were abolished. The title of supreme head of the church,\r\nit was declared, \"never was or could be justly or lawfully attributed\r\nor acknowledged to any king or sovereign governor, nor in any wise\r\ncould or might rightfully, justly, or lawfully, by the king or\r\nsovereign governor of the same realms, be claimed, challenged, or\r\nused.\" \"All Bulls, dispensations, and privileges obtained before the\r\nyear 1529 or at any time since, or which shall hereafter be obtained\r\nfrom the See of Rome, not containing matter contrary or prejudicial to\r\nthe authority, dignity, or pre-eminence royal or imperial of these\r\nsaid realms or to the laws of this realm\" were allowed to be \"put in\r\nexecution, used, and alleged in any civil court in Ireland and\r\nelsewhere.\" The jurisdiction of the bishops was restored, the laws\r\nagainst heresy passed in the reign of Richard II. and Henry IV. were\r\nrenewed, and the payment of First Fruits was suppressed. Care was\r\ntaken, however, to avail of the dispensation granted by the Holy See,\r\nwhereby those who had obtained possession of the property of churches\r\nand monasteries should not be disturbed, although it was enacted that\r\nnone of the laymen who had obtained such grants could plead the rights\r\nof exemption enjoyed by some of their former owners against the\r\njurisdiction of the bishops, and that notwithstanding the Statutes of\r\nMortmain those who then held \"manors, tenements, parsonages, tithes,\r\npensions or other hereditaments\" might bequeath or devise them to any\r\nspiritual body corporate in the kingdom, such clause to have the force\r\nof law for twenty years.[9]\r\n\r\nFrom no quarter was the slightest opposition offered to the\r\nrestoration of Catholic worship, and consequently there was no need to\r\nhave recourse to persecution. There was no persecution of the\r\nProtestants of Ireland by fire or torture during this reign. \"In\r\ntruth, the Reformation, not having been sown in Ireland, there was no\r\noccasion to water it by the blood of martyrs; insomuch that several\r\nEnglish families, friends to the Reformation, withdrew into Ireland as\r\ninto a secure asylum; where they enjoyed their opinions and worship in\r\nprivacy without notice or molestation.\"[10] Yet in spite of this\r\ntolerant attitude of both the officials and people of Ireland an\r\nabsurd story, first mentioned in a pamphlet printed in 1681, is still\r\nto be found in many books dealing with Mary's reign. According to this\r\nstory the queen appointed a body of commissioners to undertake a\r\nwholesale persecution in Ireland, and she entrusted this document to\r\none of the commissioners, a certain Dr. Cole. On his way to Ireland\r\nthe latter tarried at Chester, where he was waited upon by the mayor,\r\nto whom he confided the object of his mission. The landlady of the\r\ninn, having overheard the conversation, succeeded in stealing the\r\ncommission and replacing it by a pack of cards. Dr. Cole reached\r\nDublin and hastened to meet the Lord Deputy and council. \"After he had\r\nmade a speech relating upon what account he came over, he presents the\r\nbox unto the Lord Deputy, who causing it to be opened, that the\r\nsecretary might read the commission, there was nothing but a pack of\r\ncards with the knave of clubs uppermost.\" Dr. Cole assured them that\r\n\"he had a commission, but knew not how it was gone.\" Then the Lord\r\nDeputy made answer, \"Let us have another commission and we will\r\nshuffle the cards in the meanwhile.\" The messenger returned promptly\r\nto England, \"and coming to the court, obtained another commission, but\r\nstaying for a wind at the waterside, news came unto him that the queen\r\nwas dead. And thus God preserved the Protestants of Ireland.\"[11] This\r\nridiculous fabrication was first referred to in a pamphlet written by\r\nthat well-known forger, Robert Ware, in 1681, and was reprinted in his\r\n\"Life\" of Archbishop Browne (1705). Its acceptance by later writers,\r\nin spite of its obvious silliness, and unsupported as it is by the\r\nofficial documents of the period, or by any contemporary authority,\r\ncan be explained only by their religious prejudices.[12]\r\n\r\nBut though Mary restored the Mass and re-asserted the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Pope, her political policy in Ireland differed little from that of\r\nher father or her brother. She was as determined as had been Henry\r\nVIII. to bring the country under English law, and to increase thereby\r\nthe resources of the Treasury. It is true that she allowed the young\r\nGarrett Fitzgerald, who had found a refuge in Rome, to return to the\r\ncountry, that she restored to him his estates and honoured him with a\r\nseat at the privy council. Brian O'Connor of Offaly was also released\r\nfrom prison and allowed to revisit his territories. During the time\r\nSt. Leger held office he followed the old policy of strengthening\r\nEnglish influence by conciliation rather than by force. But the Earl\r\nof Sussex was of a different mind. He marshalled his forces and made\r\nraids into the Irish districts, for the princes and inhabitants of\r\nwhich he entertained the most supreme contempt. It was during the\r\nreign of Mary that the plan of the English Plantations was first put\r\ninto force by the removal of the native Irish from large portions of\r\nLeix and Offaly to make room for English settlers. And yet, in spite\r\nof the warlike expeditions of Sussex, the country went from bad to\r\nworse, so that Primate Dowdall could write to the privy council in\r\nEngland (1557) that \"this poor realm was never in my remembrance in\r\nworse case than it is now, except the time only that O'Neill and\r\nO'Donnell invaded the English Pale and burned a great piece of it. The\r\nNorth is as far out of frame as it was before, for the Scots beareth\r\nas great rule as they do wish, not only in such lands as they did\r\nlately usurp, but also in Clandeboy. The O'Moores and O'Connors have\r\ndestroyed and burned Leix and Offaly saving certain forts.\"[13]\r\n\r\nOn the death of Queen Mary in November 1558, her sister Elizabeth\r\nsucceeded to the English throne. Although she had concealed carefully\r\nher Protestant sympathies, and had even professed her sincere\r\nattachment to the old religion during the reign of her predecessor,\r\nmost people believed that important changes were pending. As soon as\r\nnews of her proclamation reached Ireland early in December, the small\r\nknot of officials, who had fallen into disgrace during the reign of\r\nthe late queen, hastened to offer their congratulations and to put\r\nforward their claims for preferment. Sir John Alen, formerly Lord\r\nChancellor and Chief Commissioner for the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries, wrote to Cecil to express his joy at the latter's\r\npromotion, enclosed \"a token,\" and reminded him of what he (Alen) had\r\nsuffered during the previous five years. Sir John Bagenall,\r\nex-governor of Leix and Offaly, recalled the fact that he had lost\r\nheavily, and had been obliged to escape to France for resisting papal\r\nsupremacy. He petitioned for a free farm worth £50 a year. Bishop\r\nStaples, in a letter to Cecil, took pains to point out that he had\r\nbeen deprived of his See on account of his marriage, and had incurred\r\nthe personal enmity of Cardinal Pole because he presumed to pray \"for\r\nhis old master's (Henry VIII.) soul.\"[14] For some time, however, no\r\nchange was made, and Catholic worship continued even in Dublin as in\r\nthe days of Queen Mary. The Lord Deputy Sussex went to England in\r\nDecember 1559, and entrusted the sword of state to the Archbishop of\r\nDublin and Sir Henry Sidney, both of whom took the oath of office\r\nbefore the high altar in Christ's Church after Mass had been\r\ncelebrated in their presence.\r\n\r\nBut the strong anti-Catholic policy of the new government soon made\r\nitself felt in England, and though the ministers were more guarded as\r\nfar as Ireland was concerned, it was felt that something should be\r\ndone there to lessen the influence of Rome. In the instructions issued\r\nto the Lord Deputy (July 1559) he was told that \"the Deputy and\r\nCouncil shall set the service of Almighty God before their eyes, and\r\nthe said Deputy and all others of that council, who be native born\r\nsubjects of this realm of England, do use the rites and ceremonies\r\nwhich are by law appointed, at least in their own houses.\"[15] In the\r\ndraft instructions as first prepared a further clause was added \"that\r\nothers native of that country be not otherwise moved to use the same\r\nthan with their own contentment they shall be disposed, neither\r\ntherein doth her Majesty mean to judge otherwise of them than well,\r\nand yet for the better example and edification of prayer in the\r\nChurch, it shall be well done, if the said councillors being of that\r\ncountry born, shall at times convenient cause either in their own\r\nhouses or in the churches the litany in the English tongue to be used\r\nwith the reading of the epistle and gospel in the same tongue and the\r\nten commandments.\"[16] Although Cecil struck out this clause with his\r\nown hand, it helps to show that the government feared to push things\r\nto extremes in Ireland.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Earl of Sussex he paid the usual official visit\r\nin state to Christ's Church, where apparently the English Litany\r\n(probably that prescribed by Henry VIII.) was sung after the Mass. In\r\nconnexion with this celebration a story was put in circulation by\r\nRobert Ware in 1683 that the clergy, dissatisfied with the change in\r\nliturgy, determined to have recourse to a disgraceful imposture to\r\nprevent further innovations. On the following Sunday when the\r\nArchbishop and Deputy assisted at Mass, one of their number having\r\ninserted a sponge soaked in blood into the head of the celebrated\r\nstatue of the Redeemer, blood began to trickle over the face of the\r\nimage. Suddenly during the service a cry was raised by the trickster\r\nand his associates, \"Behold Our Saviour's image sweats blood.\" Several\r\nof the common people wondering at it, fell down with their beads in\r\ntheir hands, and prayed to the image, while Leigh who was guilty of\r\nthe deception kept crying out all the time, \"How can He choose but\r\nsweat blood whilst heresy is now come into the Church?\" Amidst scenes\r\nof the greatest excitement the archbishop caused an examination to be\r\nmade; the trick was discovered; Leigh and his accomplices were\r\npunished by being made \"to stand upon a table with their legs and\r\nhands tied for three Sundays, with the crime written upon paper and\r\npinned to their breasts\"; and to complete the story, a recent writer\r\nadds, \"the Protestants were triumphant, the Roman party confounded,\r\nand Curwen's orders to have the statue broken up were obeyed without\r\ndemur.\"[17] Needless to say there is no foundation for such a tale. It\r\nfirst saw the light in that collection of gross inventions, /The\r\nHunting of the Romish Fox/, published by Robert Ware in 1683, and is\r\nunsupported by any contemporary witnesses. It was not known to Sir\r\nRobert Ware, from whose papers the author pretended to borrow it; it\r\nwas not known to Sir Dudley Loftus who devoted himself to the study of\r\nIrish history, and who, as nephew of Elizabeth's Archbishop of Dublin,\r\nwould have had exceptional opportunities of learning the facts, nor\r\nwas it known to Archbishop Parker, to whom, according to Ware, a full\r\naccount was forwarded immediately.[18] The author of it was employed\r\nto stir up feeling in England and Ireland so as to prevent the\r\naccession of James II., and as a cover for his forgeries he pretended\r\nto be using the manuscripts of his father.\r\n\r\nFor so far the Catholic religion was the only one recognised by law in\r\nIreland, and consequently when Elizabeth instructed the Deputy to see\r\nthat her English born subjects in Ireland should use the English\r\nservice in their private houses, she took care to promise that none of\r\nthem should be impeached or molested for carrying out her\r\ncommands.[19] But her Deputy was instructed to summon a Parliament in\r\nIreland \"to make such statutes as were lately made in England /mutatis\r\nmutandis/.\"[20] The Parliament met in Dublin on the 11th of January\r\n1560. According to the returns[21] seventy-six members representing\r\nseveral counties and boroughs were elected. Dublin, Meath, Westmeath,\r\nLouth, Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford, and Tipperary\r\nwere the only counties represented, each of them having returned two\r\nmembers. Of the boroughs represented seventeen were situated in\r\nLeinster, eight in Munster, two, Athenry and Galway, in Connaught, and\r\none only, namely, Carrickfergus, was situated in Ulster. Twenty-three\r\ntemporal peers were summoned to take their seats, all of whom belonged\r\nto Anglo-Irish families except O'Brien of Thomond and MacGillapatrick\r\nof Upper Ossory. According to the record preserved in the Rolls'\r\nOffice, three archbishops and seventeen bishops took their seats, the\r\nonly absentees being Clogher, Derry, Raphoe, Kilmore, Dromore,\r\nClonmacnoise, Achonry, Kilmacduagh, Kilfenora, and Mayo. Armagh was\r\nvacant, Primate Dowdall having died in August 1558, and his successor\r\nnot having been appointed by Rome till February 1560. But for many\r\nreasons it is impossible to believe that the twenty bishops mentioned\r\nin this list were present at the Dublin Parliament. At best it is only\r\na rather inaccurate account of those who were summoned to take their\r\nseats, as is shown by the fact that for seven of the Sees no names of\r\nthe bishops are returned; and that Down and Connor are represented as\r\nhaving sent two bishops although both Sees were united for more than a\r\ncentury. If it be borne in mind that according to the returns in the\r\nState Paper Office four archbishops and nineteen bishops are\r\nrepresented as having attended the Parliament of 1541,[22] although,\r\nin his official report to the king, the Deputy stated expressly that\r\nonly two archbishops and twelve bishops were present;[23] and also\r\nthat gross errors have been detected in the lists of spiritual peers\r\nsupposed to have been in attendance at the Parliaments of 1569[24] and\r\n1585,[25] it will be obvious to any unprejudiced mind that the return\r\nfor the Parliament of 1560 cannot be accepted as accurate.\r\n\r\nNo reliable account of the proceedings of the Parliament of 1560 has\r\nas yet been discovered. It met on the 11th January, was adjourned on\r\nthe following day till the 1st of February, when it was dissolved.[26]\r\nIt is more probable, however, that it lasted till the 12th February.\r\nAccording to the Loftus manuscripts the Parliament was dissolved \"by\r\nreason of [its] aversion to the Protestant religion, and their\r\necclesiastical government.\" \"At the very beginning of this\r\nParliament,\" according to another distinguished authority, \"Her\r\nMajesty's well wishers found that most of the nobility and Commons\r\nwere divided in opinion about the ecclesiastical government, which\r\ncaused the Earl of Sussex to dissolve them, and to go over to England\r\nto consult Her Majesty about the affairs of this kingdom.\"[27] This\r\nlatter statement is confirmed by the fact that the Earl of Sussex\r\ncertainly left Ireland in February 1560. And yet, according to the\r\naccounts that have come down to us, it was this assembly that gave\r\nProtestantism its first legal sanction in Ireland. It abolished papal\r\nsupremacy, restored to the queen the full exercise of spiritual\r\njurisdiction as enjoyed by Henry VIII. and Edward VI., enjoined on all\r\npersons holding ecclesiastical or secular offices the oath of royal\r\nsupremacy under pain of deprivation, imposed the penalty of forfeiture\r\nof all goods for the first offence on those who spoke in favour of the\r\nPope, the punishment laid down for /praemunire/ in case of a second\r\nsuch offence, and death for the third offence, and enjoined the use of\r\nthe Book of Common Prayer in all the churches of the kingdom. Any\r\nclergyman who refused to follow the prescribed form of worship was\r\nliable to forfeit one year's revenue and to be sent to prison for the\r\nfirst offence, to total deprivation and imprisonment at will for the\r\nsecond, and for the third to perpetual imprisonment. The laity were\r\nobliged to attend the service under threat of excommunication and of a\r\nfine of twelve pence to be levied off their goods and chattels by the\r\nchurch-wardens. The First Fruits were restored to the crown, and the\r\nformality of canonical election of bishops was abolished. For the\r\nfuture in case of a vacancy the right of appointment was vested\r\ndirectly in the sovereign.[28]\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the cities and counties from which the\r\nmembers were returned resisted stubbornly the introduction of the\r\nEnglish service, that most of the lay peers clung tenaciously to the\r\nMass, some of them, like the Earl of Kildare, being charged with this\r\ncrime a few months after the dissolution of Parliament, and that the\r\nbishops with one or two exceptions, opposed the change, the wonder is\r\nhow such measures could have received the sanction of Parliament.\r\nAccording to a well-supported tradition they reached the statute book\r\nonly by fraud, having been rushed through on a holiday, on which most\r\nof the members thought that no session would be held. Later on, when\r\nobjection was taken to such a method, the Deputy, it is said, silenced\r\nthe resisters by assuring them that they were mere formalities which\r\nmust remain a dead letter.[29]\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that the Irish bishops of the period acknowledged\r\nElizabeth's title of \"supreme governor in spirituals,\" and abandoned\r\nthe Mass for the Book of Common Prayer. Nothing, however, could be\r\nfarther from the truth. With the single exception of Curwen, from whom\r\nnothing better could have been expected considering his past\r\nvariations, it cannot be proved for certain that any of the bishops\r\nproved disloyal to their trust. There is some ground for suspicion in\r\ncase of Christopher Bodkin of Tuam and Thomas O'Fihil, both of whom\r\nwere represented as having taken the oath, but the strong\r\nrecommendation of the former to the Holy See by the Jesuit, Father\r\nDavid Wolf, and the fact that the latter is consistently passed over\r\nby contemporary writers in their enumeration of the Protestant\r\nbishops, show clearly that their lapse, if lapse there might have\r\nbeen, was more or less involuntary. The fact that some of the bishops,\r\nas for example Roland Fitzgerald of Cashel, Lacy of Limerick, Walsh of\r\nWaterford, De Burgo of Clonfert, Devereux of Ferns, O'Fihil of\r\nLeighlin, and Bodkin of Tuam, were appointed on government commissions\r\ndoes not prove that they had ceased to be Catholics, just as the\r\nappointment of Browne on a similar commission during the reign of\r\nQueen Mary[30] does not prove that he had ceased to be a Protestant.\r\nThat the Irish bishops remained true to the faith is clear from some\r\nof the official papers of the period. In 1564 two of the\r\ncommissioners, who had been appointed to enforce the Acts of Royal\r\nSupremacy and Uniformity of Worship, reported that there were only two\r\nworthy bishops in Ireland, namely, Adam Loftus, who had been intruded\r\ninto Armagh but who dare not visit his diocese, and Brady, who had\r\nbeen appointed by the queen to Meath. \"The rest of the bishops,\" they\r\nsay, \"are all Irish, we need say no more.\" In the following year it\r\nwas announced that Curwen of Dublin, Loftus, and Brady were the only\r\nbishops zealous \"in setting forth God's glory and the true Christian\r\nreligion\"; and in 1566 Sir Henry Sidney reported that, with the\r\nexception of Loftus and Brady, he found none others \"willing to reform\r\ntheir clergy, or to teach any wholesome doctrine, or to serve their\r\ncountry or common-wealth as magistrates.\"[31] In a document[32] drawn\r\nup by one of Cecil's spies in 1571 the bishops of the province of\r\nArmagh, Cashel, and Tuam are all described as /Catholici et\r\nConfoederati/, while in the province of Dublin, Loftus, Daly,\r\nCavenagh, and Gafney, the three latter of whom had been intruded by\r\nthe queen into Kildare, Leighlin, and Ossory, are described as\r\nProtestants, as is also Devereux of Ferns, about whose orthodoxy there\r\nmay be some doubt, though unfortunately there can be very little about\r\nhis evil life.\r\n\r\nHardly had the Acts of Royal Supremacy and Uniformity been passed when\r\na commission was addressed to a number of judges and officials to\r\nadminister the oath of supremacy. Of the bishops within the sphere of\r\nEnglish jurisdiction at this period Curwen had already given his\r\nadhesion to these measures, William Walsh of Meath promptly refused,\r\nas did also Thomas Leverous of Kildare (Feb. 1560).[33] Later on, when\r\nthe Lord Deputy returned from London, another attempt was made to\r\ninduce these bishops to change their minds, but without success. In\r\nreply to the Deputy the Bishop of Kildare declared that all\r\njurisdiction was derived from Christ, \"and since Christ did not deem\r\nit right to confer spiritual authority on women, not even on His own\r\nBlessed Mother, how, he asked, could it be believed that the Queen of\r\nEngland was the supreme governor of the Church?\" Thereupon the Deputy\r\nthreatened him with deprivation and the consequent loss of his\r\nrevenues unless he made his submission, but the bishop reminded him of\r\nthe words of Sacred Scripture, \"What shall it profit a man to gain the\r\nwhole world if he suffer the loss of his own soul?\"[34] He was driven\r\nfrom the See, and for a time taught a private school in the County\r\nLimerick, but he returned to his diocese, where he died near Nass\r\n(1577).[35] The Bishop of Meath continued to oppose the religious\r\npolicy of the government. In 1565 he was summoned once more by the\r\ncommissioners, but \"he openly protested before all the people the same\r\nday that he would never communicate or be present where the service\r\nshould be ministered, for it was against his conscience and against\r\nGod's word.\" As he was a man \"of great credit among his countrymen,\r\nupon whom in causes of religion they wholly depend,\" he was thrown\r\ninto prison,[36] where he languished in great suffering till 1572,\r\nwhen he contrived to make his escape to France. Later on funds were\r\nsupplied by the Holy See to enable him to continue his journey to\r\nSpain. He died amongst his brethren, the Cistercians, at Alcalá in\r\n1577. John O'Tonory, too, who had been appointed to Ossory after the\r\nprecipitate flight of Bale, seems to have given offence to the\r\ngovernment. Though the latter preferred to devote himself to\r\nhistorical studies after the accession of Elizabeth rather than to\r\nentrust himself to the tender mercies of the people of Kilkenny, his\r\nrival does not seem to have been regarded by the government as the\r\nlawful Bishop of Ossory. His name does appear on a list of\r\necclesiastical commissioners appointed in 1564,[37] but this seems to\r\nhave been a mistake on the part of the officials or possibly a bait\r\nthrown out to induce O'Tonory to make his submission. At any rate it\r\nis certain that in 1561 the Bishopric of Ossory was returned as\r\nvacant, and it was suggested that the appointment should be conferred\r\non the Dean of Kilkenny,[38] and in July 1565, before the death of\r\nO'Tonory, in the instructions drawn up for Sir Henry Sidney and\r\ncorrected by Cecil, her Majesty is made to say that the \"Bishopric of\r\nOssory has been long vacant.\"[39] As this can refer only to the death\r\nof Bale, who died in 1563, it is clear that O'Tonory was bracketed\r\nwith Walsh and Leverous as far as Elizabeth's ministers were\r\nconcerned. Had it been possible for the government to do so, similar\r\nmeasures would have been taken against the bishops in the other parts\r\nof Ireland, but, faced as it was with Shane O'Neill in the North and a\r\nthreatened confederation of the whole Geraldine forces in the South,\r\nit was deemed prudent not to precipitate a crisis by a violent\r\nanti-Catholic propaganda in those parts of the country not yet subject\r\nto English influence.[40]\r\n\r\nCommissioners were appointed to administer the oath of supremacy to\r\nthe bishops, the judges, and higher officials, to the justices of the\r\npeace, etc., in Kildare (1560), and to the officials in Westmeath.[41]\r\nBut unless bishops could be found willing to take the place of those\r\nwho refused to accept the new laws, no progress could be made. Curwen\r\nof Dublin, following his old rule of accepting the sovereign's\r\nreligion as the true one, submitted to the Act of Supremacy and the\r\nAct of Uniformity. In accordance with the queen's instructions he\r\nremoved the pictures and statues from Christ's Church and St.\r\nPatrick's, blotted out the paintings and frescos on the walls, so as\r\nto cover up all signs of \"idolatry\" and to prepare a back-ground for\r\ncarefully assorted Scriptural texts. He was not, however, happy in his\r\nnew position. He petitioned to be transferred from Dublin to Hereford,\r\nbasing his claim on the fact that \"he was the man that of his coat\r\nhath surlyest stood to the crown either in England or Ireland.\"[42]\r\nBut his petition was not granted. Two years later Adam Loftus, who\r\nthough nominally Archbishop of Armagh feared to visit his diocese,\r\ncharged Curwen with serious crimes which he was ashamed to\r\nparticularise, and probably as a result of this the queen instructed\r\nher Deputy to induce him to resign on the promise of an annual pension\r\nof £200 (1563).[43] But Curwen, fearing that \"the leaving of the\r\narchbishopric and not receiving another\" might lead people to believe\r\nthat he was deprived, stood out boldly for better terms. Hugh Brady,\r\nthe queen's Bishop of Meath, then proceeded to attack him. According\r\nto him everybody in Dublin from the archbishop to the petty canons\r\nwere \"dumb dogs,\" \"living enemies to the truth,\" \"neither teaching nor\r\nfeeding any save themselves,\" and \"disguised dissemblers.\"[44] As this\r\ndid not produce any effect, he wrote once more, demanding that the\r\nauthorities should \"call home the old unprofitable workman,\" a\r\npetition in which he was supported by Adam Loftus.[45] Their prayers\r\nwere heard at last, and Curwen was translated to Oxford. When the news\r\nof his recall was announced to him he merely expressed the wish that\r\nhe could get \"the last half-year's rent of the Bishopric of Oxford,\"\r\nand that he should be allowed to change quickly so that \"he might\r\nprovide fire for the winter and hay for his horses.\"[46]\r\n\r\nThe See of Armagh which was vacant by the death of Primate Dowdall was\r\nconferred by the Pope on Donat O'Teige (Feb. 1560). The latter was\r\nconsecrated at Rome, and arrived in Ireland probably towards the end\r\nof the same year. In the summer of 1561 he was present at Armagh with\r\nthe army of Shane O'Neill whom he encouraged to go forward boldly\r\nagainst the forces of the Deputy. Needless to say such a primate was\r\nnot acceptable to Elizabeth who determined to appoint one Adam Loftus,\r\nthen a chaplain to the Earl of Sussex. Loftus was a young man only\r\ntwenty-eight years of age, who had made a favourable impression on the\r\nqueen as well by his beauty as by his learning. Letters were\r\ndispatched immediately to the Chapter of Armagh commanding the canons\r\nto elect him, but as they refused to obey the order, nothing remained\r\nexcept to appoint him by letters patent (1562). As he dare not visit\r\nthe greater part of his diocese he applied for and received the\r\nDeanship of St. Patrick's, Dublin, and about the same time he became a\r\nsuitor for his brother that he might get the rectory of Dunboyne. In\r\n1563 Elizabeth thought of changing him to Kildare, and in 1566 the\r\nDeputy recommended him for Meath, believing that \"he would thankfully\r\nreceive the exchange, and willingly embase his estate to increase so\r\nmuch his revenue.\" But Loftus had set his heart on securing the\r\nArchbishop of Dublin. Time and again he made the most damaging charges\r\nagainst Curwen so as to secure his removal, although when the removal\r\nwas arranged he learned to his surprise that the authorities intended\r\nto promote not himself, but his fellow-labourer, Hugh Brady of Meath.\r\nIn April 1566, when he thought that Brady had no chance of succeeding\r\nto Dublin, he had recommended him for the appointment, but in\r\nSeptember, when he learned that there was danger of his recommendation\r\nbeing followed, he wrote to warn Cecil that \"if it would please his\r\nhonour to pause a while he could show such matter as he would, except\r\nit were for the Church of God's sake, be loath to utter by any means,\r\nbut least of all by writing, upon knowledge whereof the matter, he\r\nknows, should go no further.\" Brady having learned that Loftus had\r\ngone to England wrote to Cecil to put him on his guard against\r\nbelieving any charges against him that might be made by the Primate.\r\nHe returned in November without having succeeded, only to find that\r\nShane O'Neill had overrun his diocese so that it was not worth more\r\nthan £20 a year. He petitioned to be allowed to resign, \"for,\" he\r\nsaid, \"neither is it [Armagh] worth anything to me, nor [am] I able to\r\ndo any good in it, for that altogether it lieth among the Irish.\" At\r\nlast in 1567 his wishes were granted, and he became Archbishop of\r\nDublin. But he was still dissatisfied. As the diocese, according to\r\nhim, was worth only £400 (Irish) a year (over £30,000) and had only\r\ntwo hundred and forty acres of mensal land, he insisted that he should\r\nbe allowed to hold with it the Deanship of St. Patrick's, a request,\r\nhowever, that was refused peremptorily by the queen.[47] In Dublin he\r\ncontinued the same policy of grabbing everything for himself, his\r\nrelatives and dependents until at last the chapter, weary of his\r\nimportunities, obliged him to promise not to ask for anything more.\r\nFortunately his guarantee was entered in the records, as he appeared\r\nsoon again to solicit one last favour.\r\n\r\nIn place of Dr. Walsh of Meath, who refused to take the oath of\r\nsupremacy, Hugh Brady was appointed (1563). In his letters to Cecil he\r\ncomplained that the payment of his fees and the expenses of the\r\nconsecration would beggar him, that he was opposed by both the clergy\r\nand laity of his diocese in such a stubborn way that he would \"rather\r\nbe a stipendiary priest in England than Bishop of Meath in Ireland,\"\r\nand that unless her Majesty pardoned the debts she was claiming he\r\nmust lose all hope, as he was very poor and obliged to entertain right\r\nroyally, \"for these people,\" he wrote, \"will have the one or the\r\nother, I mean they will either eat my meat and drink or else myself.\"\r\nThe relations existing between Loftus of Armagh and the Bishop of\r\nMeath were of the most strained kind. When Brady learned that Loftus\r\nhad been made Dean of St. Patrick's he addressed an indignant protest\r\nto Cecil, but as both Loftus and himself aspired to become Archbishop\r\nof Dublin, both united to attack Curwen so as to secure his removal.\r\nGrave charges were made by Loftus against Brady in 1566, but once he\r\nhad attained the object of his desires, namely his promotion to\r\nDublin, he had no scruple in attaching his name to a very laudatory\r\ncommendation of Brady's labours and qualifications (1567).[48]\r\n\r\nA certain Dr. Craik was appointed by Elizabeth to Kildare in\r\nopposition to Dr. Leverous. The new bishop was far from being content\r\nwith the honour that had been conferred upon him. Writing to his\r\npatron, Lord Robert Dudley, he complained that he was in continual and\r\ndaily torment owing to the fact that he was bishop in a diocese where\r\nhe could neither preach to the people nor could the people understand,\r\nand where he had no one to assist him. He succeeded in securing for\r\nhimself the Deanship of St. Patrick's in Dublin, and was a strong\r\nsuitor for the Bishopric of Meath. Not content with his revenues, he\r\nsold most of the episcopal lands in Kildare so that he reduced the\r\ndiocese \"to a most shameful state of poverty.\"[49] Finally, he went\r\nover to England to petition the queen for a remission of his fees, but\r\nhe was thrown into the Marshalsea prison from which he was released\r\nonly a few months before his death.[50] Donald Cavenagh was appointed\r\nby the queen to Leighlin (1567), where he devoted himself principally\r\nto enriching himself by disposing of the diocesan property; and John\r\nDevereux, who, according to Loftus, was most unfit owing to the fact\r\nthat he had been deprived of the Deanship of Ferns \"for confessed\r\nwhoredom,\"[51] was appointed Bishop of Ferns (1566).\r\n\r\nWith men such as these in charge of the new religious movement it was\r\nalmost impossible that it could succeed. In spite of the various royal\r\ncommissions appointed between the years 1560 and 1564 to secure\r\nsubmission to the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity, the people still\r\nclung tenaciously to the old faith. Though Elizabeth and her advisers\r\nwere anxious to destroy the Catholic religion in Ireland they deemed\r\nit imprudent to do so immediately in view of the threatening attitude\r\nof O'Neill and of several of the other Irish and Anglo-Irish nobles.\r\nIn case of the Act of Uniformity it had been laid down expressly that\r\nin places where the people did not understand Irish the service might\r\nbe read in Latin, and as not even the people in Kildare knew English\r\nat this time,[52] it followed that outside of Dublin the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer was not obligatory. Indeed outside Dublin, Meath,\r\nKildare, and portion of Armagh very little attempt seems to have been\r\nmade to put these laws into execution. From the draft instructions\r\ndrawn up for Sir Henry Sidney in 1565 it is perfectly clear that\r\noutside the Pale territory zealous measures had not been taken to\r\nenforce the new doctrines, and that even within the Pale the\r\nauthorities were not inclined to press matters to extremes. In the\r\nvarious agreements concluded between Shane O'Neill and Elizabeth,\r\nO'Neill was not called upon to renounce the Pope. It was thought to be\r\nmuch more prudent to pursue a policy of toleration until the English\r\npower could be placed upon a sound footing, and that if this were once\r\naccomplished the religious question could be settled without much\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lord Deputy was empowered to punish those who refused to\r\nattend the English service by imprisonment (1561),[53] he was obliged\r\nto report in the following year that the people were \"without\r\ndiscipline,\" and \"utterly devoid of religion,\" that they came \"to\r\ndivine service as to a May game,\" that the ministers were held in\r\ncontempt on account of their greediness and want of qualifications,\r\nthat \"the wise fear more the impiety of the licentious professors than\r\nthe superstition of the erroneous Papists,\" and that nothing less than\r\na Parliamentary decree rigorously enforced could remedy the evil.[54]\r\nThe commissioners who had been appointed to enforce the religious\r\ninnovations reported in 1564 that the people were so addicted to their\r\nold superstitions that they could not be induced to hear the new\r\ngospel, that the judges and lawyers, however, had promised to enforce\r\nthe laws, that they had cautioned them not to interfere with the\r\nsimple multitude at first but only \"with one or two boasting Mass men\r\nin every shire,\" and that with the exception of Curwen, Loftus, and\r\nBrady, all the rest of the bishops were Irish about whom it was not\r\nnecessary to say anything more.\"[55] In a document presented to the\r\nprivy council in England by the Lord Deputy and council of Ireland\r\n(1566) a good account is given of the progress and results of the so-\r\ncalled Reformation. They reported that Curwen, Loftus, and Brady were\r\ndiligent in their pastoral office, but that \"howbeit it [the work]\r\ngoeth slowly forward within their said three dioceses by reason of the\r\nformer errors and superstitions inveterated and leavened in the\r\npeople's hearts, and in [on account of] want of livings sufficient for\r\nfit entertainment of well-chosen and learned curates amongst them, for\r\nthat these livings of cure, being most part appropriated benefices in\r\nthe queen's majesty's possession, are let by leases to farmers with\r\nallowance or reservation of very small stipends or entertainments for\r\nthe vicars or curates, besides the decay of the chancels, and also of\r\nthe churches universally in ruins, and some wholly down. And out of\r\ntheir said dioceses, the remote parts of Munster, Connaught, and other\r\nIrish countries and borders thereof order cannot yet so well be taken\r\nwith the residue till the countries be first brought into more civil\r\nand dutiful obedience.\"[56]\r\n\r\nIn Dublin, where it might be expected that the government could\r\nenforce its decrees, the people refused to conform, and even in 1565,\r\nafter several commissions had finished their labours, it was admitted\r\nthat the canons and clergy of St. Patrick's were still Papists. From\r\nMeath the queen's bishop received such a bad reception that he\r\ndeclared he would much rather have been a stipendiary priest in\r\nEngland than Bishop of Meath. \"Oh what a sea of trouble,\" he wrote,\r\n\"have I entered into, storms rising on every side; the ungodly lawyers\r\nare not only sworn enemies to the truth, but also for the lack of due\r\nexecution of law, the overthrowers of the country; the ragged clergy\r\nare stubborn and ignorantly blind, so as there is left little hope of\r\ntheir amendment; the simple multitude is through continual ignorance\r\nhardly to be won so as I find /angustiae undique/.\" But while Brady\r\nwas involved in a sea of difficulties, the Catholics of Meath rallied\r\nround their lawful bishop, Dr. Walsh. According to the report of\r\nLoftus, who ordered his arrest (1565), \"he was one of great credit\r\namongst his countrymen, and upon whom as touching causes of religion\r\nthey wholly depended.\" Loftus petitioned to be recalled from Armagh\r\nbecause it was not worth anything to him nor was he able to do any\r\ngood in it, since it lay among the Irish; and Craik, who was appointed\r\nto Kildare, announced that he could not address the people because\r\nthey were not acquainted with the English language, nor had he any\r\nIrish clergymen who would assist him in spreading the new gospel.[57]\r\n\r\nIn 1564 several bodies of commissioners were appointed to visit\r\ncertain portions of Leinster, Munster, and Connaught to enforce the\r\nActs of Supremacy and Uniformity, and about the same time a royal\r\nproclamation was issued enforcing the fine of twelve pence for each\r\noffence on those who refused to attend Protestant service on Sundays\r\nand holidays. Whether these commissioners acted or not is not clear,\r\nbut undoubtedly the commissioners appointed for the Pale made a\r\nserious attempt to carry out their instructions. They brought together\r\njuries chosen out of the parishes situated within the sphere of\r\nEnglish influence \"and upon the return of their several verdicts they\r\nfound many and great offences committed against her Majesty's laws and\r\nproceedings. But among all their presentments they brought nothing\r\nagainst the nobility and chief gentlemen, who yet have contemned her\r\nMajesty's most godly laws and proceedings more manifestly than any of\r\nthe rest, and therefore they determined to call them before them, and\r\nto minister to them certain articles, unto which they required the\r\nnobility to answer upon their honours and duty without oath. The rest\r\nof the gentlemen answered upon their oaths. And when they brought\r\ntheir several answers, they found by their own confession, that the\r\nmost part of them had continually, since the last Parliament,\r\nfrequented the Mass and other services and ceremonies inhibited by her\r\nMajesty's laws and injunctions, and that very few of them ever\r\nreceived the Holy Communion, or used such kind of public prayer and\r\nservice as is presently established by law.\" \"Whereupon,\" Loftus\r\nadded, \"I was once in mind (for that they be so linked together in\r\nfriendship and alliance one with another, that we shall never be able\r\nto correct them by the ordinary course of the statute) to cess upon\r\nevery one of them, according to the quality of their several offences,\r\na good round sum of money, to be paid to your Majesty's use, and to\r\nbind them in sure bonds and recognisances ever hereafter dutifully to\r\nobserve your Majesty's most godly laws and injunctions. But for that\r\nthey be the nobility and chief gentlemen of the English Pale, and the\r\ngreatest number too; I thought fit not to deal any further with them\r\nuntil your Majesty's pleasure were therein specially known.\"[58] So\r\nlong as her Majesty required the noblemen of the Pale to fight against\r\nShane O'Neill and the other Irish chieftains she was too prudent to\r\ninsist on strict acceptance of her religious innovations.\r\n\r\nIn 1560 Pius IV. determined to send a special commissary into Ireland\r\nin the person of the Irish Jesuit, Father David Wolf, who was a native\r\nof Limerick, highly recommended to the Holy See by the general of the\r\nSociety. The commissary was instructed to visit and encourage the\r\nbishops, clergy, and chief noblemen of the country to stand firm; he\r\nwas to draw up lists of suitable candidates for bishoprics, to\r\nre-organise some of the religious houses and hospitals, and to\r\nestablish grammar schools where the youth of the country might receive\r\na sound education. He left Rome in August 1560, and arrived in Cork in\r\nJanuary 1561. According to his report the people flocked to him in\r\nthousands to listen to his sermons, to get absolution, and to procure\r\nthe re-validation of invalid marriages. For so far, he was able to\r\nassure the Roman authorities, heresy had made no progress among the\r\nmasses. From Cork he went to Limerick, and from Limerick he journeyed\r\nthrough Connaught. During the course of this journey he learned a\r\ngreat deal that was favourable about Bodkin the Archbishop of Tuam and\r\nRoland De Burgo of Clonfert. He visited the greater part of the\r\ncountry with the exception of the Pale, and, as he found it impossible\r\nto go there, he empowered one of the priests to absolve from reserved\r\ncases, particularly from the crimes of heresy and schism. In 1568 he\r\nwas arrested and thrown into prison together with Archbishop Creagh of\r\nArmagh. Pius V. instructed his nuncio in Spain to request the good\r\noffices of Philip II. to procure their release, but apparently the\r\nrepresentations of the Spanish government were without effect. In\r\n1572, however, Father Wolf succeeded in making his escape from prison,\r\nand before setting sail for Spain he had the happiness of receiving\r\nthe humble submission of William Casey, who had been promoted to the\r\nSee of Limerick by Edward VI. From Tarbet the papal commissary sailed\r\nfor Spain. Later on he returned once more to Ireland, and was active\r\nin assisting James Fitzmaurice. He is supposed to have died in Spain\r\nin 1578 or 1579.[59]\r\n\r\nFather Wolf had been instructed specially to recommend to the Holy See\r\nthose priests whom he deemed qualified for appointment to vacant\r\nbishoprics. This was a matter of essential importance, and as such he\r\ndevoted to it his particular care. Thomas O'Herlihy was appointed to\r\nRoss (1561); Donald McCongail or Magongail, the companion of his\r\njourneys, was appointed to Raphoe (1562); the Dominicans O'Harte and\r\nO'Crean were provided to the Sees of Achonry and Elphin in the same\r\nyear at his request, and during the time he remained in Ireland his\r\nadvice with regard to episcopal nominations was followed as a rule. He\r\nwas instructed also to establish grammar schools throughout the\r\ncountry, and he was not long in Ireland till he realised the necessity\r\nof doing something for education, and above all for the education of\r\ncandidates for the priesthood. In 1564 he obtained from Pius IV. the\r\nBull, /Dum exquisita/,[60] empowering himself and the Archbishop of\r\nArmagh to erect colleges and universities in Ireland on the model and\r\nwith all the privileges of the Universities of Paris and Louvain. For\r\nthis purpose they were empowered to apply the revenues of monasteries,\r\nand of benefices, and to make use of the ecclesiastical property\r\ngenerally. Unfortunately owing to the disturbed condition of the\r\ncountry, and the subsequent arrest of both the archbishop and the\r\npapal commissary, it was impossible to carry out this scheme.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier sessions of the Council of Trent the Archbishop of\r\nArmagh had taken a leading part. When the Council opened for its final\r\nsessions in January 1562 Ireland was represented by O'Herlihy of Ross,\r\nMcCongail of Raphoe, and O'Harte of Achonry. Nor were these mere idle\r\nspectators of the proceedings. They joined in the warm discussions\r\nthat took place regarding the Sacrifice of the Mass, Communion under\r\nboth kinds, the source of episcopal jurisdiction and of the episcopal\r\nobligation of residence, the erection of seminaries, and the\r\nmatrimonial impediments. It is said that it was mainly owing to their\r\nexertions that the impediment of spiritual relationship was\r\nretained.[61] After their return attempts were made to convoke\r\nprovincial synods to promulgate the decrees of the Council of Trent.\r\nIn 1566 apparently some of the prelates of Connaught assembled and\r\nproclaimed them in the province of Tuam; in 1587 the Bishops of\r\nClogher, Derry, Raphoe, Down and Connor, Ardagh, Kilmore, and Achonry,\r\ntogether with a large number of clergy met in the diocese of Clogher\r\nfor a similar purpose, and in 1614 they were proclaimed for the\r\nprovince of Dublin by a synod convoked at Kilkenny.[62]\r\n\r\nIn 1560, and for several years after, the state of affairs in Ireland\r\nwas so threatening that Elizabeth and her advisers were more concerned\r\nabout maintaining a foothold in the country than about the abolition\r\nof the Mass. In the North Shane O'Neill had succeeded on the death of\r\nhis father (1559), and seemed determined to vindicate for himself to\r\nthe fullest the rights of the O'Neill over the entire province of\r\nUlster. The Earl of Kildare refused to abandon the Mass, and was in\r\nclose correspondence both with his kinsman the Earl of Desmond, and\r\nwith several of the Irish chieftains. It was feared that a great\r\nCatholic confederation might be formed against Elizabeth, and that\r\nScotland, France, Spain, and the Pope might be induced to lend their\r\naid.[63] Instructions were therefore issued to the Lord Deputy to\r\ninduce the Earl of Kildare to come to London where he could be\r\ndetained, and to stir up the minor princes of Ulster to weaken the\r\npower of O'Neill. By detaining men like the Earls of Kildare, Desmond,\r\nand Ormond in London, by stirring up rivalries and dissensions amongst\r\nIrishmen, and above all by getting possession of the children of both\r\nthe Anglo-Irish and Irish nobles and bringing them to England for\r\ntheir education, it was hoped that Ireland might be both Anglicised\r\nand Protestantised.[64]\r\n\r\nThe most urgent question, however, was the reduction of Shane O'Neill.\r\nAt first Elizabeth was inclined to come to terms with him, but the\r\nEarl of Sussex in the hope of overcoming him by force had him\r\nproclaimed a traitor, and advanced against him with a large force\r\n(1561). He seized Armagh, took possession of the cathedral, and\r\nconverted it into a strong fortress. O'Neill soon appeared accompanied\r\nby the lawful archbishop, who exhorted the Irish troops to withstand\r\nthe invader. The English army suffered a bad defeat, and after the\r\nfailure of several attempts to reduce O'Neill by force, the Deputy\r\ndetermined to try other methods. He hired an individual named Neil\r\nGray to murder O'Neill and acquainted Elizabeth with what he had\r\ndone,[65] but O'Neill was fortunate enough to elude the assassin. At\r\nlength O'Neill was induced to go to England (1562), where he was\r\nforced to agree to certain terms; but, as he discovered that he had\r\nbeen deceived throughout the entire negotiations, he felt free on his\r\nreturn to assert his claims to Ulster. Elizabeth was not unwilling to\r\nyield to nearly all his demands, even to the extent of removing Loftus\r\nfrom the Archbishopric of Armagh and allowing the appointment of\r\nO'Neill's own nominee. The Earl of Sussex, however, was opposed to\r\npeace. Having been forced, against his will, to come to terms with\r\nO'Neill (1563), he determined to have recourse once more to the method\r\nof assassination. A present of poisoned wine was sent to O'Neill by\r\nthe Deputy as a token of his good will,[66] and it was only by a happy\r\nchance that O'Neill and his friends were not done to death. The new\r\nDeputy, Sir Henry Sidney, succeeded in stirring up O'Donnell and the\r\nother Ulster princes against O'Neill by promising them the protection\r\nof England. Having been defeated in battle by O'Donnell in 1567, Shane\r\nfled for aid to the Scots of Antrim, on whom he had inflicted more\r\nthan one severe defeat, and while with them he was set upon and slain.\r\nBy his disappearance the power of the Irish in Ulster was broken, and\r\nthe way was at last prepared for subduing the northern portion of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nIn the South of Ireland the young Earl of Desmond was in a\r\nparticularly strong position, but, unfortunately, he was personally\r\nweak and vacillating, and by playing off the Earl of Ormond against\r\nhim Elizabeth was able to keep him in subjection to England, to use\r\nhim against Shane O'Neill, and to prevent him from taking part in a\r\nnational or religious confederation. In 1567 the Earl was arrested and\r\nsent to London, where he was detained as a prisoner. Although the Lord\r\nDeputy allowed himself to be received at Limerick by Bishop Lacy with\r\nfull Catholic ceremonial, still the appointment of Protestant\r\ncommissioners to administer the territories of Desmond, and the\r\nintrusion of a queen's archbishop into the See of Cashel (1567) made\r\nit clear that the government was determined to force the new religion\r\non the people. About the same time the Pope took steps to strengthen\r\nthe Catholics of Munster by appointing Maurice Fitzgibbon,\r\ncommendatory abbot of a Cistercian monastery in Mayo, to the vacant\r\nSee of Cashel. The new archbishop was in close correspondence with the\r\nDesmond party in Ireland, and with Philip II. of Spain. On his arrival\r\nin Ireland (1569) he found that James Fitzmaurice, the cousin of the\r\nEarl of Desmond, was organising a confederation to defend the Catholic\r\nreligion. MacCarthy Mor, the O'Briens of Thomond, the sons of the Earl\r\nof Clanrickard, and Sir Edmund Butler had promised their assistance.\r\nThe new archbishop came to Cashel, took possession of his cathedral in\r\nspite of the presence of the royal intruder, and even went so far as\r\nto force the latter to attend a solemn Mass in the cathedral. This is\r\nthe only foundation for the story that he suffered personal violence\r\nto MacCaghwell or that he captured him and brought him a prisoner to\r\nSpain.[67]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Sidney mustered his forces to proceed against the rebels,\r\nand the Earl of Ormond was sent over from England to detach his\r\nbrother Sir Edmund Butler from his alliance with the Desmonds. The\r\nArchbishop of Cashel was dispatched into Spain to seek the assistance\r\nof Philip II. (1569), and he brought with him a document purporting to\r\nbe signed by thirteen archbishops and bishops, and by most of the\r\nleading Irish and Anglo-Irish nobles in Leinster, Munster, and\r\nConnaught, asking the King of Spain to assist them in their defence of\r\nthe Catholic religion, and offering to accept as their sovereign any\r\nSpanish or Burgundian prince whom Philip II. might wish to\r\nnominate.[68] The fact that the Pope had published in February 1570\r\nthe Bull, /Regnans in excelsis/ announcing the excommunication and\r\ndeposition of Queen Elizabeth served to encourage the Catholics of\r\nMunster, but notwithstanding this sentence the archbishop failed to\r\nobtain any effective assistance either from Spain or from the Pope.\r\nUndaunted by the ill-success of his agent, Fitzmaurice issued a\r\nproclamation addressed to the prelates, princes, and lords of Ireland,\r\nannouncing that he had taken up arms against a heretical ruler who had\r\nbeen excommunicated and deposed by the Pope, that a large body of\r\nEnglish Catholics were in rebellion or were ready to rise, that he had\r\nbeen appointed by the Pope captain-general of the Irish Catholic\r\nforces, and that it behoved them to rally to his standard to defend\r\nthe Catholic faith, to suppress all false teachers and schismatical\r\nservices, and to deliver their country from heresy and tyranny.[69]\r\nFitzmaurice was, however, disappointed in his hopes. The Earl of\r\nOrmond hastened over to Ireland to hold the Butler territories for the\r\nqueen. Many of his confederates deserted him or were overthrown, and\r\nafter a long struggle he was overcome and obliged to make his\r\nsubmission (1573-74).\r\n\r\nIn 1575 James Fitzmaurice fled from Ireland to seek assistance from\r\nsome of the Catholic rulers of the Continent. His petitions met,\r\nhowever, with scant success in Paris, Lisbon, and Madrid, and it was\r\nonly from Pope Gregory XIII. that he received any promise of men and\r\narms. Already an English adventurer named Stukely had been intriguing\r\nwith the Pope to obtain a small army and fleet for a descent upon\r\nIreland, and the celebrated English theologian and controversialist,\r\nNicholas Sander,[70] who was working at the Roman Court on behalf of\r\nthe English exiles, also favoured the attempt. The expedition started\r\nin 1578, but when Stukely, who was in supreme command, reached Lisbon,\r\nhe joined his forces with those of the King of Portugal in an attack\r\non the Moors, in the course of which he was killed, and his army was\r\ndestroyed. By the exertions of Sander and of the nuncio at Madrid,\r\nFitzmaurice was enabled to fit out a small ship, and in 1579,\r\naccompanied by Sander as papal representative, he arrived in Dingle.\r\nAt once he addressed an appeal to the people to join him in fighting\r\nfor the faith against a heretical sovereign. So terrified were the\r\nvast body of the noblemen by the punishments inflicted on them already\r\nand by the fear of losing all their property in case of another defeat\r\nthat the proclamation met with only a poor response. Ormond joined Sir\r\nWilliam Pelham against the rebels, as did also several of the old\r\nenemies of the Geraldines. Fitzmaurice himself was killed early in the\r\ncampaign by the Burkes of Castleconnell, and although the Earl of\r\nDesmond at last decided to take up arms, there was no longer any hope\r\nof success. For years the way was carried on with relentless cruelty\r\nby Pelham and afterwards by Lord Grey de Wilton; the crops and the\r\ncattle were destroyed in a hope of starving out the scattered\r\nfollowers of Desmond, and a force composed of Spaniards and Italians\r\nwere butchered after they agreed to surrender the fortress of\r\nDunanore. Viscount Baltinglass hastened to take up arms against the\r\nDeputy, and with the assistance of Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne he inflicted\r\na severe defeat on Lord Grey at Glenmalure (1580). But in the end the\r\nrebellion was completely suppressed, and the Earl of Desmond was taken\r\nand murdered (1583). Two years before, Nicholas Sander, the papal\r\nrepresentative, died in a wood near Limerick after having received the\r\nlast sacraments at the hands of the Bishop of Killaloe.[71]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Shane O'Neill Elizabeth's ministers deemed it\r\nadvisable to summon a second Parliament (1569). Unfortunately no list\r\nof the members returned for the boroughs and counties has been\r\npreserved, but from the account that has come down to us of the\r\nopening debates it is clear that the most elaborate precautions were\r\ntaken to pack the assembly. New boroughs, which had not been\r\nrecognised hitherto as corporations, were created; the sheriffs and\r\ndeputies appointed by the government returned themselves as fit and\r\nproper persons to sit in Parliament, and in a large number of cases\r\nEnglish officials and lawyers, who had never seen the constituencies\r\nthey were supposed to represent, were returned by the sheriffs at the\r\ninstigation of the Deputy and his agents.[72] From the list of peers\r\nit would seem as if twenty-three archbishops and bishops took their\r\nseats, but the list is so full of glaring inaccuracies that it cannot\r\nbe relied upon. At best it represents merely the number who were\r\nentitled to sit, and was based entirely on the list drawn up for the\r\nParliaments of 1541 and 1560.[73]\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met James Stanihurst, Recorder of Dublin, was\r\nappointed speaker. From the beginning it was evident that in spite of\r\nall his efforts the government party was likely to meet with serious\r\nopposition. Sir Christopher Barnewall took strong exception to the\r\nmethods that had been adopted to pack the assembly, but though the\r\njudges when appealed to upheld his objections on two counts they\r\ndecided against him on the vital question, namely, the selection of\r\nEnglish officials who had never seen the constituencies they were\r\nsupposed to represent. Backed by the decision of the judges, the Lord\r\nDeputy and the Speaker bore down all opposition. An act was passed for\r\nthe attainder of Shane O'Neill, for the suppression of the title The\r\nO'Neill, and for securing to her Majesty the County Tyrone and other\r\ncounties and territories in Ulster. The spiritual peers resisted\r\nstrongly a proposal for the erection of schools to be supported out of\r\nthe ecclesiastical property, but in the end the measure was passed. It\r\nenacted that a free school should be established in each diocese at\r\nthe expense of the diocese, that the salary should be paid by the\r\nbishops and clergy, that the schoolmasters should be Englishmen or at\r\nleast of English extraction, and that their appointment should be\r\nvested in the Lord Deputy except in the Dioceses of Armagh, Dublin,\r\nMeath, and Kildare, in which the nomination of the teachers should\r\nrest in the hands of the archbishop or bishop. The exceptions clearly\r\nindicate that only the royal bishops could be relied upon to carry out\r\nthe educational policy of the government, and this was brought out\r\neven more explicitly by the act empowering the Deputy to appoint to\r\nall ecclesiastical dignities in Munster and Connaught. A bill for the\r\nrepair of the churches at the public expense was thrown out in the\r\nHouse of Commons.[74]\r\n\r\nThe gradual extension of English influence in both the North and the\r\nSouth enabled Elizabeth and her advisers to throw off the mask of\r\ntoleration, and to take more active measures for enforcing the new\r\nreligion. Already Bishop Walsh of Meath had been thrown into prison\r\n(1565), from which he escaped in 1572 and fled to Spain; Bishop\r\nLeverous had been driven from his See in Kildare, though on account of\r\nthe influence of his patron, the Earl of Kildare, he was permitted to\r\nend his days in his own diocese; Bishop Lacy of Limerick was reported\r\nby the Lord Deputy (1562) as \"a stubborn and disobedient man in causes\r\nof religion\" and as having committed offences whereby he had forfeited\r\nhis bishopric by the laws of the realm. For some time Limerick was\r\nregarded as vacant, but the threatening attitude of the Geraldines\r\nmade it impossible to interfere with its bishop, and when the Lord\r\nDeputy visited the city in 1567 he even allowed himself to be received\r\nby the bishop with full Catholic ceremonial. When, however, the power\r\nof the Southern confederation was broken Bishop Lacy was deprived of\r\nhis See as far as royal letters patent could do it, and William Casey,\r\nthe nominee of Edward VI. was placed in possession. The latter had\r\nmade his submission to the Pope and had declared his sorrow for his\r\ncrimes in the presence of David Wolf. Though apparently he had fallen\r\nonce again, he was distrusted by those who had appointed him as is\r\nshown by the fact that a Scotchman named Campbell was set over him in\r\n1585 to attend \"to the spiritual functions of the bishopric.\"[75]\r\n\r\nThe Pope appointed Donat O'Teige Archbishop of Armagh in 1560, and on\r\nhis death Richard Creagh was designated as his successor. The latter\r\nwas a native of Limerick, who had graduated at Louvain, and at the\r\ntime he was nominated by David Wolf for an Irish archbishopric he kept\r\na school in his native diocese. Having been consecrated in Rome in\r\n1564 he arrived in Ireland towards the end of that year only to be\r\narrested and thrown into prison, from which he managed to make his\r\nescape at Easter (1565). He returned to his diocese, but he soon found\r\nhimself in conflict with Shane O'Neill. The archbishop was an Anglo-\r\nIrishman, who stood for loyalty to the queen, and who regarded O'Neill\r\nand his followers as both rebels, and, in a sense, savages. Instead of\r\nencouraging O'Neill's men to maintain their struggle he preached on\r\nthe duty of obedience, whereat O'Neill was so enraged that he was at\r\nfirst inclined to drive the Primate from Armagh. He burned the\r\ncathedral of Armagh not, however, as is sometimes represented, in\r\nhatred of the archbishop, but because it had been used as a fortress\r\nby the English. The relations between the spiritual and temporal ruler\r\nof Ulster improved, and Creagh addressed a petition to the Deputy to\r\nbe allowed to continue the Catholic services in the churches (1566).\r\nHe was captured once again early in 1567, and put upon his trial. The\r\njury having refused to find a verdict against him, both they and the\r\naccused were committed to prison in Dublin Castle. The archbishop\r\neluded his guards once again, and it was only after the Earl of\r\nKildare had promised that his life should be spared that his\r\nwhereabouts were discovered. In December 1567 he was lodged in the\r\nTower of London, in which he was kept a close prisoner, though he\r\nstill contrived to communicate with Rome and with his diocese. Despite\r\nthe intercession of the Spanish ambassador, and notwithstanding the\r\nfact that he suffered from grievous bodily infirmities, he remained a\r\nprisoner till his death in October 1585. As a guarantee had been given\r\nby the Earl of Kildare that his life would be spared, it was not\r\ndeemed prudent to execute him, but according to well authenticated\r\nevidence his death was brought about by poison.[76]\r\n\r\nThomas O'Herlihy was appointed Bishop of Ross on the recommendation of\r\nFather Wolf in 1561, and after having been consecrated he attended the\r\nCouncil of Trent. On his return to Ireland he took an active part in\r\nencouraging James Fitzmaurice, and was deputed to accompany the\r\nArchbishop of Cashel to seek for aid from Philip II. of Spain. He was\r\ncaptured in 1571 and sent to the Tower of London, where he was kept\r\nprisoner for about three years and a half. He came back once again to\r\nhis diocese, and laboured strenuously, not merely in Ross, but in\r\nvarious districts in the South till his death in 1579 or 1580.[77]\r\nMaurice Fitzgibbon, Archbishop of Cashel, went to Spain as the\r\nrepresentative of the Southern Geraldines and their allies. Having\r\nfailed to get any help from Philip II., he endeavoured at various\r\ntimes to interest the King of France, the Duke of Anjou, and the Duke\r\nof Alva in Irish affairs. Though he was certainly in Scotland, where\r\nhe was arrested in 1572, it is doubtful if he ever returned to his\r\ndiocese. According to one authority he was captured in Munster and\r\nkept a prisoner in Cork till his death in 1578, but it is more\r\nprobable that he died at Oporto.[78]\r\n\r\nAfter the suppression of the Geraldine uprising and after the decree\r\nof excommunication had been issued against Elizabeth still more\r\nviolent measures were taken against the bishops and clergy. The\r\nFranciscan, Bishop O'Hely, was taken, together with another member of\r\nhis order, at Kilmallock, and both were put to death (1578 or 1579).\r\nEdmund Tanner, who had been appointed to Cork in 1574, and entrusted\r\nwith special faculties for the provinces of Dublin and Cashel, was\r\narrested shortly after his arrival in Ireland and was thrown into\r\nprison. He succeeded, however, in escaping, and he continued his\r\nlabours in various parts of Munster and Leinster till his death in\r\n1578 or 1579. Nicholas Skerrett, a graduate of the /Collegium\r\nGermanicum/ in Rome, was appointed to Tuam in October 1580. He was\r\nthrown into prison after his arrival in Ireland, and, having succeeded\r\nin escaping from his captors, he made his way into Spain. He died at\r\nLisbon in 1583 or 1584. Maurice MacBrien was appointed to Emly in 1567\r\non the recommendation of Father Wolf. During the earlier stages of the\r\nDesmond rebellion he took active steps to promote the Catholic\r\nconfederation. At this period it is not improbable that he went to\r\nSpain to solicit the co-operation of Philip II., but he returned to\r\nIreland, was captured in 1584, and two years later he died in prison\r\nin Dublin. Peter Power or de la Poer was provided to Ferns by the Pope\r\nin 1582. He was arrested and while in prison was induced to make his\r\nsubmission, but on his release, stricken with sorrow for the weakness\r\nhe had shown, he boldly confessed his error and was arrested once\r\nmore. How long he was detained is not certain, but it is clear from a\r\nletter of the Bishop of Killaloe that he was treated with the utmost\r\nseverity. He died in Spain in 1587.[79]\r\n\r\nIn 1581 Dermot O'Hurley was appointed to the Archbishopric of Cashel.\r\nHe had been a distinguished student of Louvain, and was then a\r\nprofessor of Canon Law at Rheims. Hardly had he reached Ireland when\r\nthe government spies were on his track. For some time he remained in\r\nthe vicinity of Drogheda, and then he withdrew to the castle of the\r\nBaron of Slane, from which he proceeded through Cavan and Longford to\r\nhis diocese. Having learned, however, that the Baron of Slane was in\r\ndanger for having afforded him assistance he surrendered himself to\r\nhis persecutors. He was brought to Dublin, in the course of which he\r\nadmitted that he was an archbishop appointed by the Pope, but he\r\ndenied that he had come to Ireland to stir up strife or to encourage\r\ntreasonable conspiracies. On one occasion at least he was subjected to\r\nhorrible torture to extract from him some damaging admissions. At the\r\nadvice of Walsingham his feet and legs were encased in tin boots and\r\nhe was held over a fire. As he still refused to submit he was tried by\r\ncourt-martial and condemned. In June 1584 he was hanged in Dublin.[80]\r\nEdmund McGauran, who was translated from Ardagh to Armagh in 1587,\r\ndevoted himself earnestly to the task of inducing the Catholic princes\r\nof Ulster to defend their religion and their territories. He was slain\r\nduring a battle between Maguire of Fermanagh and the English in\r\n1593.[81] Redmond O'Gallagher, Bishop of Derry, was specially active\r\nthroughout the whole province of Ulster, and so powerful were his\r\nprotectors that for years the government agents were afraid to arrest\r\nhim, but in the end he was slain together with three of his priests by\r\nsoldiers from the Lough Foyle garrison (1601).[82]\r\n\r\nIn the early years of Elizabeth's reign the government from motives of\r\nprudence abstained from adopting violent measures to promote the\r\nchange of religion. But after 1570 there was a decided change, and\r\nparticularly after 1580 the persecution was carried on with great\r\nbitterness. Many of the clergy, both secular and regular, were put to\r\ndeath. Amongst the latter the few Jesuits who had come into the\r\ncountry to help to carry on the work begun by Father David Wolf, the\r\nFranciscans, and the Dominicans, were pursued with relentless\r\nseverity. Sometimes they were put to death by the soldiers without any\r\nform of trial, sometimes they were executed according to the\r\nproclamations of martial law, and sometimes they were allowed a form\r\nof trial. But the fact that they were priests was sufficient to secure\r\ntheir conviction. Several laymen were put to death for refusing to\r\nchange their religion, for harbouring priests, or for having studied\r\nin some of the Catholic colleges on the Continent. Although Henry\r\nVIII. had succeeded in destroying many of the religious houses, still\r\nin a great part of the North, West, and South of Ireland the law had\r\nnot been enforced, and even in the districts where the English held\r\nsway several of the monasteries enjoyed a precarious existence, partly\r\nowing to the kindness of certain noblemen, partly also to royal\r\nexemptions. But with the gradual subjugation of the country during the\r\nreign of Elizabeth more determined measures were taken for the\r\nsuppression of such institutions. According to a return presented to\r\nthe authorities in London (1578) \"thirty-four abbeys and religious\r\nhouses with very good lands belonging to them, never surveyed before\r\n1569,\" were seized, as were also \"seventy-two abbeys and priories\r\nconcealed from her Majesty.\"[83] From a revenue return presented in\r\n1593 it can be seen that the suppression of these houses and the\r\nseizure of their property helped considerably to strengthen the royal\r\nexchequer. From the possessions in Ireland that belonged formerly to\r\nreligious houses in England the queen received annually in round\r\nnumbers £538, from the lands belonging to St. John of Jerusalem £776,\r\nfrom those of the monastery of Thomastown £551, from the possessions\r\nof St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin, £329, and from the monasteries and other\r\nreligious houses in Ireland £4,716.[84] The destruction of the\r\nmonasteries did not, however, mean the extinction of the Mendicant\r\nOrders. They still continued to maintain themselves in the country, so\r\nthat during the worst days of the seventeenth century the Franciscans\r\nand Dominicans were to be reckoned with as the most dangerous\r\nopponents of the religious policy of the English government.\r\n\r\nOnly in case of one bishop, the notorious Miler Magrath, was Elizabeth\r\nable to secure submission. He was a Franciscan friar, who, having been\r\nsent to Rome to petition that the vacant See of Down and Connor should\r\nbe conferred on Shane O'Neill's brother, took steps to secure the\r\nappointment for himself (1565). Finding on his return that he could\r\nnot hope to get any revenue from his diocese on account of the\r\nopposition of O'Neill, he made his submission to the queen (1567) and\r\nreceived as his reward the diocese of Clogher, and later on the\r\nArchbishopric of Cashel (1570). For the greater part of his term of\r\noffice as archbishop he held the Sees of Waterford and Lismore, and\r\nwhen he resigned them in 1607 he obtained a grant of Achonry and\r\nKillala. While pretending to be scandalised by the toleration shown to\r\nCatholics, and especially to Catholic officials, and to be anxious\r\nthat the laws should be enforced with the utmost rigour he took\r\nmeasures to warn the clergy whenever there was danger of arrest. On\r\none occasion when he was in London, having learned that a raid was\r\ncontemplated against the priests, he wrote to his wife to warn Bishop\r\nMacCragh of Cork to go into hiding at once, and to send away the\r\npriests who had taken refuge in his own palace at Cashel lest he\r\nshould get into trouble. He was denounced by the officials in Dublin\r\nas a traitor, a drunkard, and a despoiler of the goods of the Church.\r\nHe sold or leased the property of his dioceses, kept a large number of\r\nbenefices in his own hands solely for the sake of the revenue,\r\nappointed his own sons, his daughter, and his daughter-in-law to\r\nparishes to provide them with an income, built no schools, and allowed\r\nthe churches to go into ruins. His children made no secret of the fact\r\nthat they were Catholics, and the archbishop himself seemed to think\r\nthat though Protestantism had been useful to him in life, the old\r\nreligion would be preferable at death. In 1608 faculties had been\r\ngranted to Archbishop Kearney of Cashel for absolving Magrath from the\r\nguilt of heresy and schism. Some years later he besought a Franciscan\r\nfriar to procure his reconciliation with Rome, promising that for his\r\npart, if the Pope required it, he would make a public renunciation of\r\nProtestantism. This request of his was recommended warmly to the Holy\r\nSee by Mgr. Bentivoglio, inter-nuncio at Brussels, but the love of the\r\narchbishop for the revenues of Cashel and of his other bishoprics and\r\nbenefices seems to have proved stronger than his desire for pardon,\r\nfor he continued to enrich himself and his friends at the expense of\r\nthe State Church till his death in 1622. It was believed by his\r\ncontemporaries that on his death-bed he abjured his errors, and was\r\nreconciled with the Church by one of his former religious\r\nbrethren.[85]\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the religious houses and collegiate churches during\r\nthe reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Elizabeth dealt a heavy\r\nblow to Irish education. Here and there through the country, clergy\r\nand laymen contrived to teach schools and to give their pupils a sound\r\nknowledge of the classics as well as of the language, literature, and\r\nhistory of their country. But the theological colleges were closed;\r\nOxford and Cambridge were no longer safe training-places for Irish\r\necclesiastics, and unless something could be done at once there was\r\ngrave danger that when the bishops and clergy, who were then at work,\r\npassed away, they would leave none behind them to take their places.\r\nFortunately the close and direct communication between Ireland and the\r\nCatholic nations of the Continent suggested a possible method of\r\npreventing such a calamity, by the establishment, namely, of Irish\r\ncolleges in Rome, France, Spain, and the Netherlands. These\r\ninstitutions owed their existence to the efforts of Irish bishops and\r\npriests, and to the generous assistance of the Popes, and the\r\nsovereigns of Spain and France. They were supported by the donations\r\nof individual benefactors, by grants from the papal treasury or the\r\nroyal treasuries of Spain and France, and by the fees paid by\r\nstudents, some of whom were wealthy enough to bear their own expenses,\r\nwhile others of them were ordained priests before they left Ireland so\r\nthat they might be able to maintain themselves from their /honoraria/\r\nfor Masses.\r\n\r\nIn Spain Irish colleges were established at Salamanca, Seville,\r\nAlcalá, Santiago de Compostella, and Madrid. The college at Salamanca\r\nwas founded by Father Thomas White, S.J., a native of Clonmel, with\r\nthe approval of Philip II., in 1592 under the title of /El Real\r\nColegio de Nobles Irlandeses/. The King of Spain provided a generous\r\nendowment, and the control of the college was entrusted to the\r\nJesuits. Shortly after its foundation complaints were made in the\r\nnames of O'Neill and O'Donnell that the administrators of the college\r\nshowed but scanty attention to the claims of students from Ulster and\r\nConnaught (1602), a complaint which seems to be justified by the rolls\r\nof matriculation, on which the names of very few students from these\r\nprovinces are to be found. Those who presented themselves at Salamanca\r\ntook an oath to return to labour in the Irish mission after the\r\ncompletion of their studies, and to enable them to do this a certain\r\nsum of money was granted to them from the royal treasury of Spain to\r\ncover the expenses of the journey to Ireland. Many of the most\r\ndistinguished of the Irish bishops and priests during the seventeenth\r\ncentury were men who had graduated at Salamanca.[86] The college at\r\nCompostella was founded in 1605, was endowed partly by Philip III.,\r\nand was placed in charge of the Jesuits. It served as an auxiliary to\r\nSalamanca, and its students were sent there for their theological\r\ntraining. The College of the Immaculate Conception at Seville owed its\r\norigin (1612) to some of the Irish secular clergy. It was endowed very\r\ngenerously by Philip III. who placed the Jesuits in control of it in\r\n1619. To help to provide for the support of the students the Irish\r\nmerchants, who carried on a brisk trade with Seville and Cadiz at this\r\nperiod, bound themselves to bestow on the college a certain percentage\r\non every cask of wine they shipped, while Paul V. granted permission\r\nto the fishermen of the province of Andalusia to fish on six Sundays\r\nor holidays on condition that they devoted the results of their\r\nlabours to the support of the Irish College. The college at Madrid was\r\nfounded by Father Theobold Stapleton (1629), and was used principally\r\nas a hospice for the reception of Irish priests who had completed\r\ntheir studies, and who came to the Spanish capital to receive the\r\nmoney guaranteed by the king to enable them to return to Ireland. In\r\n1657 George de Paz y Silveira, who was related on his mother's side to\r\nthe MacDonnells of Antrim, founded a college at Alcalá principally for\r\nstudents from the North of Ireland. According to the directions of the\r\nfounder the election of the rector was vested in the hands of the\r\nstudent body, a regulation that led to grave disorders, and finally to\r\nthe closing of the college. The Irish college at Lisbon owed its\r\nexistence to the activity of the Jesuits, notably of Father John\r\nHoling. It was opened in 1593, but it was only two years later that\r\nowing to the kindness of a Spanish nobleman a permanent residence was\r\nacquired, over which Father White, S.J., was placed as rector. A\r\ncommunity of Irish Dominican Fathers was opened at Lisbon, as was also\r\na convent of Dominican Nuns.\r\n\r\nIrish students received a friendly welcome not merely in Spain, but\r\nalso in the Spanish Netherlands. From the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury several ecclesiastical students from Ireland fled to Louvain\r\nfor their education, but it was only in 1623 that Archbishop MacMahon\r\nof Dublin succeeded in founding a separate institution, the celebrated\r\n/Collegium Pastorale/ for the training of secular priests for the\r\nIrish mission. Out of his own private resources he founded six burses\r\nin the college, and at his earnest request six others were endowed by\r\nthe Propaganda. The college was formally approved by Urban VIII. in\r\n1624, and Nicholas Aylmer was placed over it as its first rector.\r\nThough many of the ablest of the Irish bishops and priests of the\r\npenal times were educated in the Pastoral College, still Ireland is\r\neven more indebted to another Irish establishment at Louvain, the\r\nIrish Franciscan College of St. Anthony of Padua. At the petition of\r\nFlorence Conry, Archbishop of Tuam, himself a Franciscan and a devoted\r\nsupporter of the Northern Chiefs, Philip III. recommended the project\r\nof an Irish Franciscan College to his representative in the\r\nNetherlands, and conferred on the institution a generous endowment.\r\nWith the blessing and approval of Paul V. the college was opened\r\nformally in 1609, and so great was its success that it soon became the\r\nleading centre of Irish missionary activity. Here Irish scholars like\r\nJohn Colgan, Hugh Ward, Father Mooney, Bonaventure O'Hussey, Hugh\r\nMacCaghwell, etc., found a home, and from the Louvain Irish printing-\r\npress were issued a large number of catechisms, religious treatises,\r\nand historical works, that did incalculable service for religion and\r\nfor Ireland. Another very important institution at Louvain was the\r\nIrish Dominican Priory known as the Holy Cross founded in 1608. A\r\nseminary for the education of secular priests was opened at Antwerp in\r\n1629 as a result of the exertions and generosity of Father Laurence\r\nSedgrave and his nephew Father James Talbot. It was supported from the\r\nrevenues bestowed upon it by its founders, from the grants of the\r\npapal nuncio at Brussels, and from the donations of Irishmen, laymen\r\nas well as clerics. At Tournai a seminary for Irish priests was\r\nfounded by Father Christopher Cusack, and its students attended\r\nlectures in the college belonging to the Jesuits. Nearly all the Irish\r\nestablishments in the Netherlands continued their work until they were\r\ndestroyed during the troubled period that followed on the outbreak of\r\nthe French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn France, too, Irish students found a welcome and a home. Colleges\r\nset apart entirely for their use were opened in Paris, Douay, Lille,\r\nBordeaux, Toulouse, and Nantes. The Irish College in Paris may be said\r\nto date from the year 1578, when Father John Lee and a few companions\r\nfrom Ireland took up their residence in the Collège Montaigu. Later on\r\na friendly nobleman, John de l'Escalopier, placed a special house at\r\ntheir disposal, and Father Lee became the first rector of the new\r\nseminary, which was recognised officially by the University of Paris\r\nin 1624. Later on the Collège des Lombards was acquired, as was also\r\nthe present house in the Rue des Irlandais. The college in Paris was\r\nfavoured specially by the Irish bishops, as is evident from the fact\r\nthat in the year 1795 more than one-third of the Irish clerical\r\nstudents on the Continent were receiving their training in the French\r\ncapital. The seminary in Douay was founded by Father Ralph Cusack in\r\n1577. At that time Douay belonged to the Spanish Netherlands, and the\r\nIrish seminary participated in the boundless generosity of the Kings\r\nof Spain. The Irish seminary at Lille was founded also by Father\r\nCusack, and was placed under the control of the Capuchins. Though it\r\nwas intended principally for the use of students from the province of\r\nLeinster, special attention was devoted to the Irish language, without\r\na knowledge of which no person could be appointed rector. The seminary\r\nat Bordeaux was founded (1603) by Father Diarmuid MacCarthy, a priest\r\nof the diocese of Cork, and later on it received special grants and\r\nprivileges from the queen-regent, Anne of Austria. The same kind\r\nbenefactress provided a home for the Irish students at Toulouse\r\n(1659), while a few years later a seminary for Irish students was\r\nestablished at Nantes.\r\n\r\nVery early in Elizabeth's reign the question of providing priests for\r\nthe Irish mission engaged the earnest attention of the Roman\r\nauthorities. Gregory XIII. had arranged for the establishment of an\r\nIrish college in Rome, and had provided the means for its support, but\r\nas an expedition was then being prepared to aid James Fitzmaurice in\r\nhis struggle in Ireland, the project was postponed, and the money was\r\ndevoted to the purposes of the war. In 1625 the Irish bishops\r\naddressed a petition to the Holy See praying for the establishment of\r\nan Irish college in Rome. Cardinal Ludovisi, then Cardinal Protector\r\nof Ireland, supported strongly this petition. He secured a house for\r\nthe accommodation of a few students, and in 1628 the college was\r\nopened. In his will the Cardinal provided generously for the endowment\r\nof the college, and he also expressed a wish that it should be\r\nentrusted to the care of the Jesuits. They entered into control in\r\n1635, and directed the affairs of the college till a short time before\r\nthe suppression of the Society.[87]\r\n\r\nElizabeth and her advisers were not slow to see the danger of allowing\r\nIrish youths to be educated in Rome, France, or in the territories of\r\nthe King of Spain. For years the English government had been advised\r\nto take measures for the establishment of a good system of English\r\nschools as the best means of conquering the country. It was suggested\r\nthat with the suppression of the monasteries and the wholesale\r\nconfiscation of their possessions something might be done by Henry\r\nVIII. or Edward VI. for the cause of education.[88] But these hopes\r\nwere doomed to speedy disappointment. The revenues of the religious\r\nhouses, which had provided centres of learning for the boys and girls\r\nof the country, found their way into the royal treasury or into the\r\npockets of the dishonest commissioners, and no educational\r\nestablishments were erected in their place. The Deputy did, indeed,\r\ninform the canons of St. Patrick's, Dublin, that their church should\r\nbe converted to a better use, namely, a university, but the promise\r\nwas made only to induce them to surrender without a struggle. The\r\nvaluable church plate, crosses, etc., were melted down and handed over\r\nto the mint.[89]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth a proposal was made to\r\ncarry out the promise of Henry VIII. by converting St. Patrick's into\r\na university. Archbishop Curwen objected strongly to such a\r\nsuggestion, nominally on the ground that a university would only serve\r\nas an excuse for the Irish rebels to send their sons to the capital to\r\nlearn the secrets of the Pale, but in reality because he feared that\r\nthe project would interfere with his own income. At various times and\r\nin various forms the plan was brought forward once more. Sir John\r\nPerrott was anxious to signalise his term of office as Lord Deputy by\r\nthe establishment of a university in Dublin, but Archbishop Loftus,\r\nwho as Archbishop of Armagh had supported the conversion of St.\r\nPatrick's into a university, having changed his mind once he had\r\nsecured his own transference to Dublin, opposed warmly the project of\r\nthe Deputy. When, however, he had succeeded in saving St. Patrick's\r\nfor his relatives and dependents he brought forward another proposal,\r\nnamely, that the Corporation of Dublin should hand over the site of\r\nthe old monastery of All Hallows for the establishment of a\r\nuniversity. The corporation agreed to this proposal, and in 1592 a\r\ncharter was granted by Elizabeth. An appeal was then issued for\r\nsubscriptions, and in a short time about £2,000 was collected, many of\r\nthe Anglo-Irish Catholics being amongst the subscribers. In 1593\r\nTrinity College was opened for the reception of students. Though care\r\nhad been taken by the archbishop when discussing the subject with the\r\nCorporation of Dublin, most of the members of which were still\r\nCatholic, and by the Deputy when appealing for funds for the erection\r\nof the buildings, not to raise the question of religion, yet Trinity\r\nCollege was intended from the beginning to be a bulwark of\r\nProtestantism as well as of English power in Ireland. Elizabeth had\r\nalready done much to forward the cause of the new religion by getting\r\npossession of the children of the Anglo-Irish or Irish nobles and\r\nbringing them to England to be reared up as Protestants and as\r\nEnglishmen,[90] and it was hoped that Trinity College, supported by\r\nthe diocesan schools, would do for the better class of the nation what\r\nOxford and Cambridge were doing for the unfortunate children of the\r\nchiefs who were kidnapped in the name of religion and statesmanship.\r\nThe new college set itself to carry out exactly the wishes of its\r\nfounders, and in return from its compliancy it received large\r\nendowments from the English crown mainly by grants of confiscated\r\nterritories in different parts of Ireland.[91]\r\n\r\nYet in spite of all the measures that were taken, commissions, fines,\r\nexecutions, bestowal of honours and appointments, diocesan schools,\r\nand kidnapping of children, the Reformation made but little progress.\r\nThe truth is that Elizabeth's representatives in Ireland had not the\r\npower to enforce her wishes in regard to religion, nor did Elizabeth\r\nherself desire to stir up a general insurrection by attempting to\r\npunish the lay nobles for their flagrant disregard of her ordinances.\r\nThus in 1585 Walsingham sent over express instructions to the\r\nProtestant Archbishop of Armagh (Long) that the gentlemen of the Pale\r\nwere to be excused from taking the oath of allegiance,[92] and in 1591\r\nSir George Carew informed Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam that the queen was\r\ndispleased with him because \"she feared that he was too forward in\r\ndealing with matters of religion,\" and that he (Carew) had attempted\r\nto excuse the Deputy by pointing out that on account of the\r\nforbearance of the government, \"they of the Pale were grown insolent.\"\r\nAt one time Elizabeth wrote to the Deputy and council blaming them for\r\nneglecting to push forward the interests of the new religion (1599),\r\nwhile the very next year she instructed Lord Mountjoy not to interfere\r\nby any severity or violence in matters of religion, until the power of\r\nEngland was established so firmly that such interference could be\r\neffective. The reason for this wavering attitude is not difficult to\r\nunderstand. Elizabeth feared that a general attack upon religion as\r\nsuch would be the best means of inducing all the Catholic noblemen to\r\nforget their personal rivalries and unite in one great national\r\nconfederation. Such a turn of events might have proved disastrous to\r\nEnglish interests in Ireland, and hence care was taken to allow a\r\ncertain measure of toleration to the noblemen, and to explain away the\r\npunishments inflicted on the clergy as having been imposed not on\r\naccount of religion, but on account of their traitorous designs. This\r\nis brought out very clearly in a letter of Sir George Carew to the\r\nprivy council in 1600. The citizens of Waterford had been reported for\r\ntheir complete and open disregard of the new religion, and Carew was\r\ncharged with the work of punishing such disobedience. He wrote that he\r\nwould \"handle the matter of religion as nicely as he could,\" and that\r\nhe would endeavour to convict the leaders of the movement of treason\r\nbecause, he added, \"if it do appear in the least that any part of\r\ntheir punishment proceeds for matter of religion, it will kindle a\r\ngreat fire in this kingdom.\"[93]\r\n\r\nIn 1576 Hugh Brady, the Protestant Bishop of Meath, reported to the\r\nLord Deputy that the condition of the Established Church was\r\nlamentable, that the priests, though deprived of their livings,\r\ncontinued to maintain themselves on the voluntary offerings of the\r\npeople, that the churches had fallen into a state of decay, that no\r\nministers were at hand who could address the people in their own\r\nlanguage, and that to remedy this state of affairs Englishmen should\r\nbe sent over as bishops to organise the new religious body, and\r\nScotchmen should be requested to act as preachers.[94] When such a\r\nstate of affairs existed in the Pale districts it is easy to see that\r\nProtestantism had as yet made little progress among the Irish people.\r\nTwo years later Lord Justice Drury and Sir Edward Fyton, Treasurer,\r\nannounced to the privy council that on their arrival in Kilkenny the\r\nProtestant Bishop of Ossory reported to them \"that not only the\r\nchiefest men of that town (as for the most part they are bent to\r\nPopery) refused obstinately to come to the church, and that they could\r\nby no means be brought to hear the divine service there with their\r\nwives and families (as by her Majesty's injunctions they are bound to\r\ndo), but that almost all the churches and chapels or chancels within\r\nhis diocese were utterly ruined and decayed, and that neither the\r\nparishioners nor others that are bound to repair them and set them up\r\ncould by any means be won or induced to do so.\" The Lord Justice and\r\nhis companion called the chief men of Kilkenny before them, and bound\r\nthem in recognisances of £40 each \"that they and their wives should\r\nduly every Sunday and holiday frequent the church, and hear the divine\r\nservice.\"[95]\r\n\r\nWaterford was equally bad. In 1579 Sir William Pelham reported that\r\nMarmaduke Middleton, who had been appointed bishop by Elizabeth, had\r\nmet with a bad reception in Waterford, \"partly through the\r\ncontemptuous and obstinate behaviour of the mayor and his brethren of\r\nthat city, and partly by the clergy of that church.\" The Dean of\r\nWaterford had made himself particularly disagreeable, and on account\r\nof his behaviour Pelham recommended that he ought to be deprived of\r\nhis dignity as an example to the citizens who were \"the most arrogant\r\nPapists that live within this state.\" Bishop Middleton was most\r\nanxious to get himself removed from Waterford, where he feared that\r\nhis life was in danger. He reported that Waterford was given over to\r\n\"Rome-runners and friars,\" that clergy and people were united to\r\nprevent her Majesty's most godly proceedings, that \"Rome itself held\r\nno more superstition\" than the city over which he ruled, and that most\r\nof the Protestant incumbents were little better than \"wood-kerne.\"[96]\r\nEven towards the end of Elizabeth's reign Waterford was still, as it\r\nhad been when she ascended the throne, strongly Catholic. The privy\r\ncouncil in England warned Sir George Carew that though \"the evil\r\ndisposition of the Irish people in most places of that kingdom, and\r\nespecially of the inhabitants of Waterford, in matters of religion\"\r\nwas perfectly well known, and though great toleration had been shown\r\nthem lest they should have an excuse to rise in rebellion, \"yet\r\nsomething must be done to repress the presumption and insolency of the\r\npeople.\" For it had been announced by the Archbishop of Cashel\r\n(Magrath) \"that in Waterford there are certain buildings, erected\r\nunder colour and pretence of almshouses or hospitals, but that the\r\nsame are in very deed intended and publicly professed to be used for\r\nmonasteries and such like houses of religion, and that friars and\r\npopish priests are openly received and maintained in them . . . and\r\nexercise their service of the Mass openly and usually in many places,\r\nas if they were in no awe or fear of any exception to be taken\r\nthereunto.\" It is noteworthy, however, as indicating the extent of\r\nEnglish influence at that time in Ireland, that the members of the\r\nprivy council warned the President of Munster that they \"do not think\r\nit convenient that any extraordinary course should be taken or any\r\ndisturbance made to inquire after or to punish them for their Masses\r\nor any other popish superstitions, unless they show thereby openly to\r\nthe world an insolent contempt for her Majesty's authority.\"[97]\r\n\r\nIn 1597, when Lord Borough was sent over as Lord Deputy, Elizabeth\r\ninstructed him to discreetly inquire of the state of religion, whereof\r\nwe are informed,\" she wrote, \"there hath been notorious negligence, in\r\nthat the orders of religion are in few parts of our realm there\r\nobserved; and that which is to be lamented, even in our very English\r\nPale multitudes of parishes are destitute of incumbents and teachers,\r\nand in the very great towns of assembly, numbers not only forbear to\r\ncome to the church or divine service, but [are] even willingly winked\r\nat to use all manner of popish ceremonies.\" She ordered him to examine\r\ninto the causes of \"this general defection,\" to see what have the\r\nEcclesiastical Commissioners been doing all these years, and to\r\nforward his views as to how \"this general defection might be reformed,\r\nin some convenient sort, and not thus carelessly suffered as though\r\nshe had granted toleration of Popery.\"[98] Three years later (1600)\r\nSir George Carew furnished a very gloomy report on the progress of the\r\nnew religion. \"If the Spaniards do come hither,\" he wrote, \"I know no\r\npart of the kingdom that will hold for the queen, and the cities\r\nthemselves will revolt with the first. For it is incredible to see how\r\nour nation and religion is maligned, and the awful obedience that all\r\nthe kingdom stands in unto the Romish priests, whose excommunications\r\nare of greater terror unto them than any earthly horror whatsoever.\r\nUntil of late, although the townsmen have ever been obstinate Papists,\r\nyet /pro forma/ the mayors and aldermen would go to the church. But\r\nnow not so much as the mayors will show any such external obedience,\r\nand by that means the queen's sword is a recusant, which in my\r\njudgment is intolerable. Nevertheless I do not think it good to insist\r\nmuch upon it in this troublesome time. As for Masses and such slight\r\nerrants here, they are of no great estimation. I am not over-curious\r\nto understand them, so as they be not used contemptuously and publicly\r\nin derogation of the queen's laws. But the mayors of the cities and\r\ncorporate towns to be let run in so manifest contempts I do not\r\nwish.\"[99]\r\n\r\nNor is it strange that the new religion had made such little progress\r\nin Ireland. Apart from the fact that the Irish people were thoroughly\r\nCatholic at heart, the means adopted to bring about their apostasy was\r\nnot of such a kind as to ensure success. The English sovereigns, their\r\nofficials in Dublin, and a section of the Anglo-Irish nobles aimed at\r\ngetting possession of the ecclesiastical property and patronage, and\r\nonce they had attained their object they had but scant regard for the\r\nclaims of religion. Englishmen were sent over as archbishops or\r\nbishops, who could not preach in a language that the people could\r\nunderstand, and who had no other desire than to enrich themselves,\r\ntheir children, and their relatives. Archbishop Browne had set an\r\nexample in this direction, which example was not lost on his\r\nsuccessor, Adam Loftus, who was so greedy in petitioning for\r\nappointments that his chapter was forced to demand from him a pledge\r\nthat he would look for nothing more. Archbishop Long of Armagh (1584-\r\n89) wasted the property of the diocese to such an extent that his\r\nsuccessor had barely an income of £120 a year and not a house to give\r\nhim shelter. Miler Magrath enriched himself out of Cashel, Emly,\r\nWaterford and Lismore, Killala, and Achonry. Twenty of the parishes of\r\nEmly were held by himself; twenty-six by his sons, daughters, and near\r\nrelations; nineteen were left vacant; men \"fitter to keep hogs than to\r\nserve in church\" were appointed to some livings, and \"in the two\r\ndioceses (Cashel and Emly) there was not one preacher or good minister\r\nto teach the subjects their duties to God and His Majesty.\" Craik of\r\nKildare, Cavenagh of Ossory, and Allen of Ferns were accused of\r\nalienating the diocesan property of their respective Sees. With the\r\nsingle exception of Brady, the Protestant Bishop of Meath, against\r\nwhom Loftus declared he could bring such charges as he would be loath\r\nto utter, hardly one of the men appointed by Elizabeth to Irish\r\nbishoprics was worthy of his position. Loftus was an impecunious\r\ncourtier; Magrath had no religion except to make money and indulge his\r\npassion for strong drink; Knight the Scotchman, who was sent to Cashel\r\nto watch him, was removed on account of public drunkenness; Devereux\r\nwas appointed to Ferns, although, according to Loftus, he had been\r\ndeprived of his deanship on account of confessed immorality; Richard\r\nDixon was deprived of his See within one year after his appointment by\r\nthe queen for manifest adultery, and Marmaduke Middleton of Waterford\r\nhaving been translated to St. David's was accused of \"grave\r\nmisdemeanours,\" the most serious of which was the publication of a\r\nforged will, and was degraded by the High Commission Court. With such\r\nmen in charge of the work of \"reforming\" the clergy and people of\r\nIreland, it is no wonder that the Reformation made so little\r\nprogress.[100]\r\n\r\nThe men into whose hands the property and patronage of the Church had\r\npassed took no steps to look after the repair of the church buildings\r\nor to provide clergy to preach the new religion. In some cases their\r\nneglect was due to the fact that they themselves were Catholic in\r\ntheir sympathies, and in other cases because they did not want to\r\nincur any expenses. As a consequence, the churches were in ruins and\r\nroofless, and no religious service of any kind was provided. Few\r\nEnglish ministers of good standing in their own country cared to come\r\nto Ireland except possibly in the hope of securing a bishopric in the\r\nPale districts, and as a consequence, the men who came were \"of some\r\nbad note,\" on account of which they were obliged to leave their own\r\ncountry. Hence, in order to provide ministers to spread the new gospel\r\nit was necessary to ordain those who were willing to receive orders as\r\na means of making their living. It is no wonder, therefore, that\r\nEdmund Spenser described the Irish Protestant clergy of the period as\r\n\"bad, licentious, and most disordered.\" \"Whatever disorders,\" he\r\nwrites, \"you see in the Church of England, you may find in Ireland,\r\nand many more, namely, gross simony, greedy covetousness,\r\nincontinence, careless sloth, and generally all disordered life in the\r\ncommon clergyman. And, besides all these, they have their particular\r\nenormities; for all Irish ministers that now enjoy church livings are\r\nin a manner mere laymen, saving that they have taken holy orders, but\r\notherwise they go and live like laymen, follow all kinds of husbandry,\r\nand other worldly affairs as other Irishmen do. They neither read the\r\nScriptures, nor preach to the people, nor administer the communion.\" A\r\ngood account of the motley crowd who had been enlisted to carry out\r\nthe work of reform is given by Andrew Trollope, himself an English\r\nlawyer and a Protestant. Although he referred particularly to Munster\r\nhis account may be taken as substantially correct for the rest of\r\nIreland. \"In truth,\" he wrote, \"such they [the clergy] are as deserve\r\nnot living or to live. For they will not be accounted ministers but\r\npriests. They will have no wives. If they would stay there it were\r\nwell; but they will have harlots . . . And with long experience and\r\nsome extraordinary trail of those fellows, I cannot find whether the\r\nmost of them love lewd women, cards, dice, or drink best. And when\r\nthey must of necessity go to church, they carry with them a book of\r\nLatin of the Common Prayer set forth and allowed by her Majesty. But\r\nthey read little or nothing of it, or can well read it, but they tell\r\nthe people a tale of Our Lady or St. Patrick, or some other saint,\r\nhorrible to be spoken or heard, and intolerable to be suffered, and do\r\nall they may to allure the people from God and their prince, and their\r\ndue obedience to them both, and persuade them to the devil and the\r\nPope.\" The Lord Deputy sent a report to England in 1576 \"on the\r\nlamentable state of the Church\" in Ireland. \"There are,\" he wrote,\r\n\"within this diocese [Meath] two hundred and twenty-four parish\r\nchurches, of which number one hundred and five are impropriated to\r\nsundry possessions; no parson or vicar resident upon any of them, and\r\na very simple or sorry curate for the most part appointed to serve\r\nthem; among which number of curates only eighteen were found able to\r\nspeak English, the rest being Irish ministers, or rather Irish rogues,\r\nhaving very little Latin, and less learning and civility. . . . In\r\nmany places the very walls of the churches are thrown down; very few\r\nchancels covered; windows or doors ruined or spoiled. . . . If this be\r\nthe state of the church in the best-peopled diocese, and best governed\r\ncountry of this your realm, as in truth it is, easy is it for your\r\nMajesty to conjecture in what case the rest is, where little or no\r\nreformation either of religion or manners hath yet been planted and\r\ncontinued among them. . . . If I should write unto your Majesty what\r\nspoil hath been, and is of the archbishoprics, of which there are\r\nfour, and of the bishoprics, whereof there are above thirty, partly by\r\nthe prelates themselves, partly by the potentates, their noisome\r\nneighbours, I should make too long a libel of this my letter. But your\r\nMajesty may believe it, upon the face of the earth where Christ is\r\nprofessed, there is not a Church in so miserable a case.\"\r\n\r\nSpenser drew a sharp contrast between the Catholic clergy and the\r\nministers of the new gospel. \"It is great wonder,\" he wrote, \"to see\r\nthe odds which are between the zeal of the Popish priests and the\r\nministers of the gospel. For they spare not to come out of Spain, from\r\nRome, and from Rheims, by long toil and dangerous travelling hither,\r\nwhere they know peril of death awaiteth them, and no reward or riches\r\nare to be found, only to draw the people unto the Church of Rome;\r\nwhereas some of our idle ministers, having a way for credit and\r\nestimation thereby opened unto them, and having the livings of the\r\ncountry offered unto them without pains and without peril, will\r\nneither for the same, nor any love of God, nor zeal of religion, nor\r\nfor all the good they may do by winning souls to God, be drawn forth\r\nfrom their warm nests to look out into God's harvest.\"[101]\r\n\r\nBut though the attempts to seduce Ireland from the Catholic faith had\r\nfailed to produce any substantial results, yet there could be no\r\ndenying the fact that Elizabeth had gone further to reduce the country\r\nto subjection than had any of her predecessors. The overthrow of the\r\nGeraldines and their allies in the South, the plantation of English\r\nUndertakers in the lands of the Earl of Desmond, the seizure of\r\nMacMahon's country, and the attempted plantation of Clandeboy, the\r\nappointments of presidents of Munster and Connaught, the reduction of\r\nseveral counties to shire-lands, the nomination of sheriffs to enforce\r\nEnglish law, and the establishment of garrisons in several parts of\r\nthe country, made it clear to any thoughtful Irishman that unless some\r\nsteps were taken at once, the complete reduction of their country was\r\nonly a matter of a few years. In the North Hugh O'Neill, son of\r\nMatthew O'Neill, was looked upon as the most powerful nobleman of the\r\nprovince. Like his father he had been in his youth an English O'Neill,\r\nand for that reason he was created Earl of Tyrone (1585), and was\r\ngranted most of the territories of Shane the Proud. But he distrusted\r\nthe English, as he was distrusted by them. The treacherous seizure of\r\nHugh O'Donnell, the planting of an English garrison at Portmore along\r\nthe Blackwater, and the warlike preparations begun by Sir Henry\r\nBagenal made it evident to him that the government aimed at the\r\ncomplete overthrow of the Irish chieftains.\r\n\r\nHaving strengthened himself by alliances with Hugh O'Donnell, Maguire,\r\nand the principal nobles of the North, he rose in arms, seized the\r\nfortress of Portmore, laid siege to Monaghan, and inflicted a very\r\nsevere defeat on the English forces at Clontibret (1595). Whatever\r\nmight have been his ulterior object, O'Neill put the question of\r\nreligion in the forefront. Already it had been noted by the English\r\nofficials that O'Neill, though brought up in England, was attached to\r\nthe \"Romish Church.\" In their negotiations with the government after\r\nthe defeat of the English forces at Clontibret, both O'Neill and\r\nO'Donnell demanded that \"all persons have free liberty of conscience.\"\r\nSimilar demands were made by the other chieftains of Ulster, and later\r\non by all the Irish nobles in Connaught, Leinster, and Munster. In\r\nreply to these demands the commissioners announced that in the past\r\nthe queen had tolerated the practice of the Catholic religion, and \"so\r\nin likelihood she will continue the same.\" When the report of these\r\nnegotiations reached England Elizabeth was displeased. The request for\r\nliberty of conscience was characterised as \"disloyal.\" O'Neill was to\r\nbe informed that \"this had been a later disloyal compact made betwixt\r\nhim and the other rebels without any reasonable ground or cause to\r\nmove them thereunto, especially considering there hath been no\r\nproceeding against any of them to move so unreasonable and disloyal a\r\nrequest as to have liberty to break laws, which her Majesty will never\r\ngrant to any subject.\"[102]\r\n\r\nThough the negotiations were continued for some time neither side was\r\nanxious for peace. Elizabeth and her officials strove to secure the\r\nsupport of the Anglo-Irish of the Pale and of a certain section of the\r\nIrish nobles. Unfortunately she was only too successful. Most of the\r\nAnglo-Irish nobles, though still devoted to the Catholic faith,\r\npreferred to accept toleration at the hands of Elizabeth rather than\r\nto fight side by side with O'Neill for the complete restoration of\r\ntheir religion.[103] O'Neill and O'Donnell turned to Spain and Rome\r\nfor support. From Spain they asked for arms, soldiers, and money to\r\nenable them to continue the struggle. From the Pope they asked also\r\nfor material assistance, but in addition they demanded that he should\r\nre-publish the Bull of excommunication and deposition issued against\r\nElizabeth by Gregory XIII., that he should declare their war to be a\r\nreligious war in which all Catholics should take the side of the Irish\r\nchiefs, that he should excommunicate the Catholic noblemen who had\r\ntaken up arms in defence of the queen, that he should grant them the\r\nfull rights of patronage enjoyed in Ulster by their predecessors, and\r\nthat he should appoint no ecclesiastics to vacant Sees without their\r\napproval.[104]\r\n\r\nThese requests were supported strongly at Rome by Peter Lombard\r\n(1601), who was appointed later on Archbishop of Armagh, and as a\r\nresult Clement VIII. determined to send a nuncio to Ireland in the\r\nperson of Ludovico Mansoni (1601). Philip III. of Spain at last\r\nconsented to dispatch a force into Ireland, but instead of landing in\r\nthe North where O'Neill and O'Donnell were all-powerful, the Spanish\r\nexhibition under command of Don Juan del Aquila arrived off Kinsale,\r\nand took possession of the town (Sept. 1601). For the three years\r\npreceding the arrival of the Spaniards the Northern chiefs had been\r\nwonderfully successful. They had defeated Marshal Bagenal at the\r\nYellow Ford (1598), had overthrown the forces of Sir Conyers Clifford\r\nat the Curlieu Mountains (1599), and had upset all the plans of the\r\nEarl of Essex, who was sent over specially by Elizabeth to reduce them\r\nto subjection. Hardly, however, had the Spaniards occupied Kinsale\r\nwhen they were besieged by the new Deputy, Lord Mountjoy, and by\r\nCarew, the President of Munster. An urgent message was dispatched by\r\nthem requesting O'Neill and O'Donnell to march to their assistance,\r\nand against their own better judgment they determined to march South\r\nto the relief of their allies. Even still, had they been satisfied\r\nwith hemming in the English forces, as O'Neill advised, they might\r\nhave succeeded, but instead of adopting a waiting policy, they\r\ndetermined to make an attack in conjunction with the Spanish force. As\r\na result they suffered a complete defeat (1602). O'Neill conducted the\r\nremnant of his army towards Ulster; O'Donnell was dispatched to seek\r\nfor further help to Spain from which he never returned, and Aquila\r\nsurrendered Kinsale and other fortresses garrisoned by Spaniards.\r\nCarew laid waste the entire province of Connaught, while Mountjoy\r\nmarched to Ulster to subdue the Northern rebels. The news of the death\r\nof O'Donnell in Spain, the desertion of many of his companions in\r\narms, and the total destruction of the cattle and crops by Mountjoy\r\nforced O'Neill to make overtures for peace. An offer of terms was made\r\nto him, and good care was taken to conceal from him the death of Queen\r\nElizabeth. He decided to meet Mountjoy and to make his submission\r\n(1603).\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] /Calendar of Patent Rolls/, i., 304.\r\n\r\n[2] Id., i., 315.\r\n\r\n[3] Moran, /History of the Archbishops of Dublin/, 52-54.

As the son of Mary Queen of Scots, and in a sense, the\r\ndescendant of the Irish Kings of Scotland[1] he was regarded with\r\nfavour both within and without the Pale. While King of Scotland he had\r\nbeen in communication with the Pope, with the Catholic sovereigns of\r\nthe Continent, and with O'Neill, and even after he had been proclaimed\r\nin London he promised some of the leading Catholic lords that they\r\nmight expect at least toleration. Without, however, waiting for any\r\nsuch promises the Catholics in the leading cities of the East and\r\nSouth made open profession of their religion. In Kilkenny, Thomastown,\r\nWaterford, Wexford, Cashel, Cork, Limerick, etc., they took possession\r\nof the churches, abolished the Protestant service wherever it had been\r\nintroduced, and restored the Mass. James White, Vicar-general of\r\nWaterford, made himself especially conspicuous as the leader in this\r\nmovement in the south-eastern portion of Ireland.[2]\r\n\r\nLord Mountjoy was in a difficult position. He was uncertain as to the\r\nreligious policy of the king, but in the end he determined to suppress\r\nthe Catholic movement by force. He marched South to Kilkenny and\r\nthence to Waterford, where he had an interview with Dr. White.\r\nEverywhere the churches were restored to the Protestants, though it\r\nwas hinted that the Mass might still be celebrated privately as in the\r\ndays of Elizabeth. In Cork the condition of affairs was much more\r\nserious, and it was necessary to bring up the guns from Haulbowline\r\nbefore the mayor and citizens could be induced to submit. Reports came\r\nin from all sides that the country was swarming with Jesuits and\r\nseminary priests, that they were stirring up the people to join hands\r\nwith the King of Spain, and to throw off their allegiance to James I.\r\nThese rumours were without foundation, as is shown by the fact that\r\nmost of the towns and cities in Leinster and Munster which were noted\r\nas specially Catholic, had not stirred a finger to help O'Neill in his\r\nwar against Elizabeth. But they were put in circulation to prejudice\r\nthe mind of King James against his Irish Catholic subjects, and to\r\nwean him away from the policy of toleration which he was said to\r\nfavour. Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin, and Jones, Bishop of Meath,\r\nhastened to warn the king against a policy of toleration. They threw\r\nthe whole blame of the late war on the Jesuits and seminary priests,\r\nand cast doubts upon the loyalty of the Catholic noblemen of the Pale.\r\nThey called upon his Majesty to make it clear \"even in the morning of\r\nhis reign,\" that he was ready \"to maintain the true worship and\r\nreligion of Jesus Christ,\" to let the people understand that \"he will\r\nnever permit and suffer that which in his godly zeal he so much\r\nabhors, to devise some means of preventing the plots and aims of\r\nJesuits and seminary priests, who \"come daily from beyond the seas,\r\nteaching openly that a king wanting the Pope's confirmation is not a\r\nlawful king,\" to send over some \"learned and discreet preachers\" to\r\nthe principal cities and towns, and to compel the people \"by some\r\nmoderate co-actions to come to church to hear their sermons and\r\nexhortations.\"[3]\r\n\r\nAs a means of spreading the new gospel amongst the Irish people it was\r\nrecommended that \"a learned ministry be planted, and that the abuses\r\nof the clergy be reformed;\" that all bishops, Jesuits, seminary\r\npriests, and friars should be banished from the kingdom, that no\r\nlawyers be admitted to the bar or to the privy council unless they\r\nattended the Protestant service, and that all sheriffs, mayors,\r\njustices of the peace, recorders, judges, and officials be forced to\r\ntake the oath of supremacy. Loftus and Jones insisted, furthermore,\r\nthat Catholic parents should be forbidden to send their children to\r\nDouay and Rheims, and should be compelled to send them to the\r\nProtestant diocesan schools. They reported that although the Bishop of\r\nMeath had opened a school in Trim at great expense to himself, only\r\nsix scholars attended, and that when the teachers began to use prayers\r\nin the school and to show themselves desirous of bringing their pupils\r\nto church, the pupils departed, and the teachers, though graduates of\r\nthe University, were left without any work to do.[4]\r\n\r\nAs James showed great reluctance to take any active measures against\r\nthe Catholics, Brouncker, the President of Munster, Lyons, Protestant\r\nBishop of Cork, and the other members of the Council of Munster issued\r\na proclamation (14 Aug. 1604) ordering \"all Jesuits, seminaries, and\r\nmassing priests of what sort soever as are remaining within one of the\r\ncorporate towns of the province\" to leave before the last day of\r\nSeptember, and not to return for seven years. Any persons receiving or\r\nrelieving any such criminals were threatened with imprisonment during\r\nhis Majesty's pleasure and with a fine of £40 for every such offence,\r\nand \"whosoever should bring to the Lord President and Council the\r\nbodies of any Jesuits, seminaries, or massing priests\" were promised a\r\nreward of £40 for every Jesuit, £6 3s. 4d. for every seminary priest,\r\nand £5 for every massing priest. Fearing, however, that his action\r\nmight be displeasing to the king, Brouncker took care to write to\r\nCecil that the cities of the South were crowded with seminary priests\r\nwho said Mass publicly in the best houses \"even in the hearing of all\r\nmen,\" and that he had delayed taking action till they began to declare\r\nboldly that his Majesty was pleased \"to tolerate their idolatry.\"[5]\r\n\r\nSir John Davies, a native of Wiltshire, who was made Solicitor-General\r\nfor Ireland on account of his poetical talent, was not opposed to the\r\npolicy of repression, but at the same time he held firmly that until\r\nthe Protestant Church in Ireland was itself reformed there could be no\r\nhope of converting the Irish people. Writing to Cecil (Feb. 1604) \"he\r\nis informed,\" he says, \"that the churchmen for the most part\r\nthroughout the kingdom are mere idols and ciphers, and such as cannot\r\nread, if they should stand in need of the benefit of their clergy; and\r\nyet the most of those whereof many be serving men and some horseboys,\r\nare not without two or three benefices apiece, for the Court of\r\nFaculties doth qualify all manner of persons, and dispense with all\r\nmanner of non-residences and pluralities. . . . The churches are\r\nruined and fallen to the ground in all parts of the kingdom. There is\r\nno divine service, no christening of children, no receiving of the\r\nsacraments, no Christian meeting or assembly, no, not once in a year;\r\nin a word, no more demonstration of religion than among Tartars or\r\ncannibals.\" In his opinion there was no use in asking the bishops of\r\nthe Pale to hold an inquiry into the abuses, for they themselves were\r\nprivy to them. \"But if the business is to be really performed, let\r\nvisitors be sent out of England, such as never heard a cow speak and\r\nunderstand not that language, that they may examine the abuses of the\r\nCourt of Faculties, of the simoniacal contracts, of the dilapidations\r\nand dishersion of the churches; that they may find the true value of\r\nthe benefices, and who takes the profits and to whose uses; to deprive\r\nthese serving men and unlettered kern that are now incumbents, and to\r\nplace some of the poor scholars of the College who are learned and\r\nzealous Protestants; to bring others out of that part of Scotland that\r\nborders on the North of Ireland, who can preach the Irish tongue, and\r\nto transplant others out of England and to place them within the\r\nEnglish Pale.\"[6]\r\n\r\nAt last, yielding to the advices that poured in on him from all sides,\r\nJames I. determined to banish the Jesuits and seminary priests in the\r\nhope that when they were removed the people might be induced to\r\nsubmit, and to insist on compliance with the terms of the Act of\r\nUniformity. He issued a proclamation (4 July 1605) denying the rumour\r\nthat he intended \"to give liberty of conscience or toleration of\r\nreligion\" to his Irish subjects, and denouncing such a report as a\r\nlibel on himself, \"as if he were more remiss or less careful in the\r\ngovernment of the Church of Ireland than of those other churches\r\nwhereof he has supreme charge.\" He commanded \"all Jesuits, seminary\r\npriests, or other priests whatsoever, made and ordained by any\r\nauthority derived or pretended to be derived from the See of Rome,\" to\r\ndepart from the kingdom before the end of December. All priests who\r\nrefused to obey or who ventured to come into Ireland after that date,\r\nand all who received or assisted such persons were to be arrested and\r\npunished according to the laws and statutes of that realm, and all the\r\npeople were exhorted \"to come to their several parish churches or\r\nchapels, to hear divine service every Sunday and holiday\" under threat\r\nof being punished for disobedience.[7]\r\n\r\nThe royal proclamation produced little or no effect. The Jesuits and\r\nseminary priests remained and even increased in numbers by new\r\narrivals from the Continental colleges and from England where the law\r\nwas more strictly enforced. Nor could the leading citizens, the mayors\r\nand the aldermen of the principal cities, be forced to come to church,\r\nbecause they preferred to pay the fine of twelve pence prescribed in\r\nthe Act of Uniformity for each offence. The government officials\r\ndetermined, therefore, to have recourse to more severe if less legal\r\nremedies. They selected a certain number of wealthy citizens of\r\nDublin, addressed to each of them an individual mandate in the king's\r\nname ordering them to go to church on a certain specified Sunday, and\r\ntreated disobedience to such an order as an offence punishable by\r\ncommon law. Six of the aldermen were condemned to pay a fine of £100,\r\nand three citizens £50, one half of the fine to be devoted to the\r\n\"reparing of decayed churches or chapels, or other charitable use,\"\r\nthe other half to go to the royal treasury. In addition to this, they\r\nwere condemned to imprisonment at the will of the Lord Deputy, and\r\ndeclared incapable of holding any office in the city of Dublin, or in\r\nany other part of the kingdom (22 Nov. 1605). A few days later other\r\naldermen and citizens of Dublin were brought before the Irish Star\r\nChamber, and having been interrogated \"why they did not repair to\r\ntheir parish churches,\" they replied \"that their consciences led them\r\nto the contrary.\" They were punished in a similar manner. Thus, two\r\nmethods were adopted for enforcing obedience to the Act of Uniformity,\r\none the infliction on the poor of the fine of twelve pence prescribed\r\nfor each offence by the law of 1560, the other, the promulgation of\r\nindividual mandates, disobedience to which was to be punished by the\r\nCourt of Star Chamber. The noblemen of the Pale, alarmed by such high-\r\nhanded action, presented a petition against the measures taken for the\r\nsuppression of their religion, praying that the toleration extended to\r\nthem hitherto should be continued. In reply to their petition the\r\nViscount Gormanston, Sir James Dillon, Sir Patrick Barnewall, and\r\nothers were committed as prisoners to the Castle, and others of the\r\npetitioners were confined to their houses in the country, and bound to\r\nappear before the Star Chamber at the opening of the next term (Dec.\r\n1605). Sir Patrick Barnewall, \"the first gentleman's son of quality\r\nthat was ever put out of Ireland to be brought up in learning beyond\r\nthe seas\" was the ablest of the Catholic Palesmen, and was sent into\r\nEngland at the request of the English authorities.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of these Catholic lords, backed[8] as it was by the danger\r\nof a new and more general rebellion, was not without its effects in\r\nEngland. In January 1607 the privy council in England wrote to Sir\r\nArthur Chichester, Lord Deputy, that although \"the reformation of the\r\npeople of Ireland, extremely addicted to Popish superstition by the\r\ninstigation of the seminary priests and Jesuits, is greatly to be\r\nwished and by all means endeavoured, still, a temperate course ought\r\nto be preserved.\" There should be no question of granting toleration,\r\nbut at the same time there should be no \"startling of the multitude by\r\nany general or rigorous compulsion.\" The principal men in the cities\r\nwho show themselves to be the greatest offenders should be punished;\r\nthe priests and friars should be banished, but no \"curious or\r\nparticular search\" should be made for them; Viscount Gormanston and\r\nhis companions should be released under recognisances, except Sir\r\nPatrick Barnewall who was to be sent into England; the Dublin aldermen\r\nshould be treated in a similar manner but should be obliged to pay the\r\nfines, and the Protestant clergy should be exhorted to take special\r\npains to plant the new religion \"where the people have been least\r\ncivil.\"[9]\r\n\r\nBut Chichester, Davies, Brouncker, and their companions had no\r\nintention of listening to the counsels of moderation. They continued\r\nto indict the poorer classes according to the clauses of the Act of\r\nUniformity and to cite the wealthier citizens before the Star Chamber\r\nfor disobedience to the royal mandates.[10] In Waterford Sir John\r\nDavies reported \"we proceeded against the principal aldermen by way of\r\ncensure at the council table of the province for their several\r\ncontempts against the king's proclamations and the special\r\ncommandments of the Lord President under the council seal of Munster.\r\nAgainst the multitude we proceeded by way of indictment upon the\r\nStatute of 2 Elizabeth, which giveth only twelve pence for absence\r\nfrom church every Sunday and holiday. The fines imposed at the table\r\nwere not heavy, being upon some £50 apiece, upon others £40, so that\r\nthe total sum came but to £400; but there were so many of the\r\ncommoners indicted that the penalty given by the statute (twelve\r\npence) came to £240 or thereabouts.\"[11] Punishments of a similar kind\r\nwere inflicted in New Ross, Wexford, Clonmel, Cashel, Youghal,\r\nLimerick, Cork, and in all the smaller towns throughout Munster. In\r\nCork the mayor was fined £100, and in Limerick more than two hundred\r\nof the burgesses were indicted, the fines paid by these being given\r\nfor the repair of the cathedral.[12] Steps were also taken in\r\nConnaught to enforce attendance at the Protestant service. Five of the\r\nprincipal citizens of Galway were summoned before the court and fined\r\nin sums varying from £40 to £20, and punishments of a lesser kind were\r\ninflicted in other portions of the province. In Drogheda \"the greatest\r\nnumber of the householders together with their wives, children, and\r\nservants,\" were summoned and fined for non-attendance at church. In\r\nMeath, Westmeath, Longford, King's County, and Queen's County the\r\ngovernment officials were particularly busy.\r\n\r\nBut though here and there a few of the prominent citizens and of the\r\npoorer classes were driven into public conformity by fear of\r\npunishment, the work of winning over the people to Protestantism made\r\nlittle progress. In Cashel the Commissioners reported (1606) that they\r\nfound only one inhabitant who came to church, and even \"the\r\nArchbishop's (Magrath) own sons and sons-in-law dwelling there\" were\r\nnoted as obstinate recusants.\"[13] Brouncker, President of Munster,\r\nwas particularly severe in his repressive measures, so much so that on\r\nhis death (1606) his successors were able to announce \"that almost all\r\nthe men of the towns are either prisoners or upon bonds and other\r\ncontempts,\" but they added the further information that many of those\r\nwho had been conformable in his time had again relapsed. The\r\nProtestant Bishop of Cork complained (1607) that in Cork, Kinsale,\r\nYoughal, and in all the country over which he had charge no marriages,\r\nchristenings, etc., were done except by Popish priests for seven\r\nyears, that the country was over-run by friars and priests who are\r\ncalled Fathers, that every gentleman and lord of the country had his\r\nchaplains, that \"massing is in every place, idolatry is publicly\r\nmaintained, God's word and his truth is trodden down under foot,\r\ndespised, railed at, and contemned of all, the ministers not esteemed\r\n--no not with them that should reverence and countenance them.\" \"The\r\nprofessors of the gospel,\" he added, \"may learn of these idolators to\r\nregard their pastors.\"[14] Sir John Davies with his usual keen insight\r\nplaced the blame for the comparative failure of the Protestant clergy.\r\n\"If our bishops, and others that have care of souls,\" he wrote (1606),\r\n\"were but half as diligent in their several charges as these men [the\r\nJesuits and seminary priests] are in the places where they haunt, the\r\npeople would not receive and nourish them as now they do. But it is\r\nthe extreme negligence and remissness of our clergy here which was\r\nfirst the cause of the general desertion and apostasy, and is now\r\nagain the impediment of reformation.\"[15] The Catholics had protested\r\ncontinually against the proceedings under royal mandates as illegal,\r\nand their protests were brought before the English privy council by\r\nSir Patrick Barnewall, who had been sent over to London as a prisoner.\r\nThe judges in England condemned the proceedings in Ireland as\r\nunwarrantable and without precedent. Barnewall was allowed to return\r\nto Ireland in 1607, and the new method of beggaring or Protestantising\r\nthe wealthier class of Irish Catholics was dropped for the time.\r\n\r\nThe king had been advised, too, to enforce the oath of supremacy in\r\ncase of all officials of the crown. Though in the beginning of the\r\nreign of Elizabeth something had been done in that direction, yet, in\r\nlater times, owing to the dangerous condition of the country Catholic\r\nofficials were not called upon to renounce the Pope. As a result, when\r\nJames ascended the throne many of the judges were Catholic, as were,\r\nalso, the great body of the lawyers. In response to the advice from\r\nIreland that judges who refused to attend church and to take the oath\r\nshould be dismissed, and that \"recusant\" lawyers should be debarred\r\nfrom practising in the courts, James instructed the council to induce\r\nJohn Everard, a Justice of the Common Pleas, to resign or conform. The\r\nmayors and aldermen of the cities, too, had never taken the oath of\r\nsupremacy. In 1607 the Lord Deputy and council of Ireland informed the\r\nprivy council in England that, \"most of the mayors and principal\r\nofficers of cities and corporate towns, and justices of the peace of\r\nthis country birth refuse to take the oath of supremacy, as is\r\nrequisite by the statute, and for an instance, the party that should\r\nthis year have been Mayor of Dublin, avoided it to his very great\r\ncharges, only because he would not take the oath.\" The contention\r\napparently was that the mayors not being crown officials were not\r\nbound to take the oath, but the lawyers decided against such a view,\r\nand steps were taken to imprison those mayors who refused, and to\r\ndestroy the charts of recusant corporations. Still in spite of the\r\nattempted banishment of the clergy, the enforcement of attendance at\r\nchurch by fines, and the punishment inflicted on the officials who\r\nrefused to take the oath, the Deputy and council were forced to admit\r\nthat they had made no progress. \"The people,\" they wrote (1607), \"in\r\nmany places resort to Mass now in greater multitudes, both in town and\r\ncountry, than for many years past; and if it chance that any priest\r\nknown to be factious and working be apprehended, both men and women\r\nwill not stick to rescue the party. In no less multitudes do these\r\npriests hold general councils and conventicles together many times\r\nabout their affairs; and, to be short, they have so far withdrawn the\r\npeople from all reverence and fear of the laws and loyalty towards his\r\nMajesty, and brought their business already to this pass, that such as\r\nare conformed and go to church are everywhere derided, scorned, and\r\noppressed by the multitude, to their great discouragement, and to the\r\nscandal of all good men.\"[16]\r\n\r\nAlthough the persecution of James I. was violent the Catholics were\r\nwell prepared to meet the storm. The Jesuits had sent some of their\r\nbest men to Ireland, including Henry Fitzsimon, who was thrown into\r\nprison, and after a long detention sent into exile, Christopher\r\nHolywood, James Archer, Andrew Morony, Barnabas Kearney, etc., and,\r\nalthough there were complaints that their college in Salamanca showed\r\nundue favour to the Anglo-Irish, this college as well as the other\r\ncolleges abroad continued to pour priests into Ireland both able and\r\nwilling to sustain the Catholic religion. The Dominicans and\r\nFranciscans received great help from their colleges on the Continent\r\nso that their numbers increased rapidly, and they were able to devote\r\nmore attention to instructing the people. As in England, the young\r\ngeneration of priests both secular and regular, sent out from the\r\ncolleges in France, Spain, and the Netherlands were much more active\r\nand more determined to hold their own than those who had preceded\r\nthem. They were in close touch with Rome where their agents kept the\r\nPapal Court informed of what was going on in Ireland. Clement VIII.\r\nhastened to send his congratulations to James I. on his accession to\r\nthe throne, and to plead with him for toleration for his Catholic\r\nsubjects. James White, Vicar-general of Waterford, wrote (1605) to\r\ninform Cardinal Baronius of the measures that had been taken to\r\nsuppress the Catholic religion and to offer his good wishes to Paul V.\r\nThe latter forwarded a very touching letter in which he expressed his\r\nsympathy with the Irish Church, commended the fidelity of the Irish\r\npeople, and exhorted them to stand firm in the face of\r\npersecution.[17] The only weak point that might be noted at this\r\nperiod was the almost complete destruction of the Irish hierarchy.\r\nO'Devany of Down and Connor, Brady the Franciscan Bishop of Kilmore,\r\nand O'Boyle of Raphoe were the only bishops remaining in the province\r\nof Ulster since the murder of Redmond O'Gallagher of Derry. Peter\r\nLombard had been appointed Archbishop of Armagh (1601), but he never\r\nvisited his diocese. In the province of Leinster Matthew de Oviedo, a\r\nSpanish Franciscan, had been appointed to Dublin (1600), and had come\r\nto Kinsale with the forces of Spain. He returned to plead for a new\r\nexpedition to Ireland. Another Spanish Franciscan, Francis de Ribera,\r\nhad been appointed to Leighlin (1587), but he died in 1604 without\r\nhaving done any work in his diocese. The rest of the Sees in Leinster\r\nwere vacant. In Munster, David O'Kearney was named Archbishop of\r\nCashel (1603), and soon showed himself to be a man of great activity\r\nand fearlessness. Dermod McCragh of Cork had been for years the only\r\nbishop in the province, and had exercised the functions of his office\r\nnot merely in the South, but throughout the province of Leinster. In\r\nthe province of Tuam all the Sees were vacant. Wherever there was no\r\nbishop in residence care was taken to appoint vicars. In Dublin\r\nBernard Moriarty who acted as vicar was arrested in the Franciscan\r\nconvent at Multifernan in 1601, and died in prison from the wounds he\r\nreceived from the soldiers. Robert Lalor who acted in the same\r\ncapacity was arrested, tried, and banished in 1606.[18]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Earl of Tyrone had been restored to his estates and had\r\nbeen received graciously by the king (1603), he was both distrusted\r\nand feared by the government. Sir Arthur Chichester, who had come to\r\nact as Lord Mountjoy's deputy in 1605, and who was appointed Lord\r\nLieutenant on the death of the latter (1607), was determined to get\r\npossession of Ulster either by driving O'Neill into rebellion or by\r\nbringing against him some charge of conspiracy. New and insulting\r\ndemands were made upon O'Neill; the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh\r\nand the Protestant Bishop of Derry and Raphoe claimed large portions\r\nof his territories as belonging to their churches, and some of the\r\nminor chieftains were urged on to appeal against him to the English\r\nauthorities. Having learned in 1607 that he stood in danger of arrest,\r\nhe and Rory O'Donnell determined to leave Ireland. In September 1607\r\nthey sailed from Rathmullen, and on the 4th October they landed in\r\nFrance. After many wanderings they made their way to Rome, where they\r\nreceived a generous welcome from Paul V. O'Donnell died in 1608, and\r\nO'Neill, who had cherished till the last a hope of returning to\r\nIreland, died in 1616.[19] Both chieftains were laid to rest in the\r\nChurch of St. Pietro di Montorio. Although the flight of the Earls\r\ncaused a great sensation both in England and Ireland, and although\r\nJames I. was said to have been pained by their departure and even to\r\nhave thought for a time of granting religious toleration, Chichester\r\nand his companions were delighted at the result of their work. The\r\nflight of Tyrone and Tyrconnell, the attempted rebellion of Sir Cahir\r\nO'Doherty, and the trumped-up charges brought against some of the\r\nother noblemen in the North opened up the prospect of a new and\r\ngreater plantation than had ever been attempted before. Tyrone,\r\nFermanagh, Donegal, Derry, Armagh, and Cavan were confiscated to the\r\ncrown at one stroke, and preparations were made to carry out the\r\nplantation in a scientific manner. The greater portion of the\r\nterritory was divided into lots of two thousand, one thousand five\r\nhundred, and one thousand acres. The Undertakers who were to get the\r\nlargest grants were to be English or Scotch Protestants and were to\r\nhave none but English or Scotch Protestant tenants, those who were to\r\nget the one thousand five hundred acres were to be Protestants\r\nthemselves and were to have none but Protestant tenants, while the\r\nportions of one thousand acres each might be parcelled out amongst\r\nEnglish, Scotch, or Irish, and from these Catholics were not excluded.\r\nThousands of acres were appropriated for the support of the Protestant\r\nreligion, for the maintenance of Protestant schools, and for the\r\nupkeep of Trinity College. A small portion was kept for a few of the\r\nold Catholic proprietors, and the remainder of the population were\r\nordered to leave these districts before the 1st May 1609. Many of them\r\nremained, however, preferring to take small tracts of the mountain and\r\nbog land from the new proprietors than to trust themselves among\r\nstrangers; but a great number of the able-bodied amongst them were\r\ncaught and shipped to serve as soldiers in the army of Sweden.[20]\r\n\r\nFor some time after the flight of the Earls there seems to have been a\r\nslight lull in the persecution, the king and his advisers fearing\r\nperhaps that their action was only a prelude to a more general\r\nrebellion in the course of which O'Neill might return at the head of a\r\nSpanish force. But once it was clear that no danger was to be\r\napprehended the Irish officials began to urge once more recourse to\r\nextreme measures. Fines were levied on Catholic towns, some of which,\r\nhowever, were remitted by the king. It was represented to Salisbury\r\n(1609) that the Catholics had grown much more bold even in Dublin,\r\nthat in the country they drew thousands to \"their idolatrous\r\nsacrifices, and that the Jesuits stir up the forces of disloyalty.\"\r\nThe writer of this letter recommended that the fine of twelve pence\r\nshould be exacted off the poor every time they absented themselves\r\nfrom religious services, that so much should be levied off the rich as\r\nwould suffice to repair all the churches and build free schools in\r\nevery county, and he himself undertook to pay £4,000 a year for the\r\nright to collect the fines of the \"Recusants\" in Munster, Leinster,\r\nand Connaught, provided only that he could count on the support of the\r\necclesiastical and civil authorities.[21] In the following year\r\nChichester informed the authorities in England that \"the mayors of\r\ncities and towns for the most part refused to take the oath of\r\nsupremacy, as did also the sheriffs, bailiffs, etc.,\" and he inquired\r\nin what manner he should act towards them. To put an end to this state\r\nof affairs Andrew Knox was sent over to Ireland as Bishop of Raphoe,\r\nand was commissioned to take measures to stir up the Protestant\r\nbishops and to suppress Popery. On his arrival he found that he had a\r\nheavy task before him. In a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\n(1611) he wrote that there were only four men in the ministry \"who\r\nhave knowledge or care to propagate the Evangell.\" \"The defection,\" he\r\nwrote, \"is so great of those who sometime professed the truth, that\r\nwhere hundreds came to several churches before, there resort now\r\nscarce six; the gathering and flocking in great numbers of Jesuits,\r\nseminary priests, friars, and gidding Papists of all sorts are so\r\nfrequent from Rome and all parts beyond the seas, that it seems to him\r\nthe greatest lading the ships bring to this country are burdens of\r\nthem, their books, clothes, crosses, and ceremonies; natives and\r\nothers in corporate towns publicly profess themselves their\r\nmaintainers. There is no diocese but it has a bishop appointed and\r\nconsecrated by the Pope, nor province that wants an archbishop, nor\r\nparish without a priest, all actually serving their time and the\r\nPope's direction and plenteously maintained by the people, so that the\r\nfew ministers that are, and bishops that profess to do any good,\r\nprofit no more than Lot did in Sodom. And sure it may be expected that\r\nif God, the king, and his Grace prevent not this unnatural growth of\r\nsuperstition, the face of the kingdom will be shortly clad with this\r\ndarkness.\"[22]\r\n\r\nHe lost no time in summoning a meeting of the bishops (1611), most of\r\nwhom, according to him, were not very reliable. The Archbishop of\r\nDublin (Jones) was \"burdened with the cares of state;\" the Archbishop\r\nof Armagh was \"somewhat old and unable;\" the Archbishop of Cashel\r\n(Magrath) was \"old and unable, whose wife and children would not\r\naccompany him to the church;\" the Archbishop of Tuam was \"well willed\r\nand best learned, but wanted maintainers and helpers,\" and the Bishops\r\nof Waterford and Limerick were described as \"having no credit.\" In\r\naccordance with the instructions that had been forwarded to them by\r\nthe king, they agreed that they would take common action for \"the\r\nsuppression of papistry and the plantation of religion;\" that they\r\nwould observe the law of residence in their several dioceses; that\r\nthey would make visitations every year of their parishes, and inquire\r\ninto the condition of the churches and the behaviour of their\r\nministers; that by authority of his Majesty's commission they would\r\n\"carefully tender the oath of allegiance to every nobleman, knight,\r\njustice of the peace, and other officers of corporate towns,\" and make\r\na return to the Lord Deputy of those who took the oath as well as of\r\nthose who refused it; that they would admit no cleric \"to any\r\nspiritual promotion\" who would not willingly take the oath of\r\nsupremacy, and that they would inquire in every deanery \"what persons\r\nreceive or harbour trafficking priests, Jesuits, seminaries and\r\nmassing priests, and friars, and will present their names together\r\nwith the names of the said priests and Jesuits to the Lord\r\nDeputy.\"[23]\r\n\r\nA royal proclamation was issued (1661) ordering all Jesuits and\r\npriests to depart from the kingdom immediately; the laity were\r\ncommanded to attend the Protestant service under threat of severe\r\npenalties, students in foreign colleges were ordered to return at\r\nonce, and Catholic schoolmasters were forbidden to teach within the\r\nkingdom. Backed by all the powers of the crown, Knox and his fellow\r\nbishops set up a terrible inquisition in every part of the country,\r\nand spared no pains to hound down the clergy and those who entertained\r\nthem, to drive the poorer classes by brute force into the church, to\r\nharass the better classes by threats and examinations, and to wipe out\r\nevery vestige of the Catholic religion. Cornelius O'Devany, a\r\nFranciscan, who had been appointed Bishop of Down and Connor (1582),\r\nwas arrested together with a priest who accompanied him, was tried in\r\nDublin, and was hanged, drawn, and quartered (1612).[24] Almost at the\r\nsame time the Protestant Bishop of Down and Connor was accused of\r\n\"incontinence, the turning away of his wife, and taking the wife of\r\nhis man-servant in her room, subornation of witnesses,\" and alienation\r\nof the diocesan property. He fled from his diocese, was arrested,\r\ndegraded, and died in prison. The Archbishop of Glasgow and Bishop\r\nKnox of Raphoe, himself a Scotchman, hastened to London to secure the\r\nappointment of one of their countrymen as his successor; but\r\nChichester wrote that though he would not say that Scotchmen were not\r\ngood men, he could aver that they were \"hot-spirited and very griping\"\r\nand \"such as were not fit for these parts.\"[25] Several attempts were\r\nmade to arrest Dr. Eugene Matthews or MacMahon, who had been\r\ntransferred (1611) by the Pope from Clogher to the Archbishopric of\r\nDublin. He was detested especially by the government, because it was\r\nthought that he owed his promotion to the influence of O'Neill, who\r\nwas also suspected of having had a voice in the appointment of the\r\nlearned Franciscan, Florence Conry to Tuam (1609).[26] During the\r\ncourse of these years jurors were threatened by the crown lawyers with\r\nthe Star Chamber unless they found a verdict of guilty, and were sent\r\nto prison for not returning a proper verdict against those accused by\r\nthe Protestant ministers of not attending church; wards of court\r\nthough Catholic were committed to the guardianship of Protestants, and\r\nin every grant a special clause was inserted \"that the ward shall be\r\nbrought up at the college near Dublin (Trinity College) in English\r\nhabit and religion;\" the Irish were excluded from all offices; men of\r\nno property were appointed as sheriffs; and the fines for non-\r\nattendance at church were levied strictly. Instead of being applied to\r\nthe relief of the poor they found their way, according to the Catholic\r\nLords of the Pale, into the pockets of the ministers. In reply to this\r\nlast charge Chichester asserted that they were not given to the poor,\r\nbecause all the poor were recusants, but they were employed \"in the\r\nrebuilding of churches, bridges, and like charitable purposes.\"[27]\r\n\r\nYet Knox did not succeed in uprooting the Catholic faith in Ireland.\r\nAccording to a report furnished (1613) to the Holy See by Mgr.\r\nBentivoglio, Internuncio at Brussels, whose duty it was to superintend\r\naffairs in Ireland, heresy had made little progress even in the\r\ncities, while the nobility and gentry were nearly all Catholic. There\r\nwere then in Ireland about eight hundred secular priests, one hundred\r\nand thirty Franciscans, twenty Jesuits, and a few Benedictines and\r\nDominicans, of whom the Franciscans were held in special esteem. The\r\nbest of the secular clergy were those who came from Douay, Bordeaux,\r\nLisbon, and Salamanca.[28] In the following year (1614) Archbishop\r\nMatthews of Dublin held a provincial synod at Kilkenny at which many\r\nuseful regulations were made regarding the conduct of the clergy,\r\npreaching, catechising, the celebration of Mass, the administration of\r\nthe sacraments, the relations between the secular and regular clergy,\r\nthe reading of controversial literature, and the observance and number\r\nof fast-days and holidays.[29] In the province of Armagh Dr. Rothe,\r\nacting under authority received from Peter Lombard, convoked a\r\nprovincial synod at Drogheda (1614). It was attended by vicars from\r\nthe several dioceses and by representatives of the various religious\r\norders, and passed regulations somewhat similar to those enacted at\r\nKilkenny. In both synods the clergy were warned to abstain from the\r\ndiscussion of state affairs and from disobedience to the civil rulers\r\nin temporal matters. At Drogheda the new Oath of Allegiance framed by\r\nJames I. was condemned as being opposed to faith and religion;\r\nCatholics were commanded not to have recourse to prevarication or\r\nwavering in regard to it, but to reject it openly, and were warned\r\nagainst attendance at divine worship in Protestant churches even\r\nthough they had previously made a declaration that they meant only to\r\npay a mark of respect to the civil rulers.[30] At the same period the\r\nFranciscans and Dominicans founded new colleges on the Continent, at\r\nDouay and Lisbon, to supply priests for their missions in Ireland.\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of Elizabeth's reign the disturbed condition of\r\nthe country made it impossible to convene a Parliament, and after the\r\naccession of James I. his advisers feared to summon such a body lest\r\nthey might be unable to control it. Still, they never lost sight of\r\nthe advantage it would be to their cause could they secure\r\nparliamentary sanction for the confiscation and plantation of Ulster,\r\nand for the new methods employed for the punishment of recusants.\r\nThese for so far had behind them only the force of royal\r\nproclamations, and their legality was open to the gravest doubt. The\r\ngreat obstacle that must be overcome before a Parliament could be\r\nconvoked was the fact that both in the House of Commons and in the\r\nHouse of Lords the Catholics might find themselves in a majority. To\r\nprevent such a dire catastrophe it was determined to create a number\r\nof new parliamentary boroughs so that many places \"that could scarcely\r\npass the rank of the poorest villages in the poorest country in\r\nChristendom\" were allowed to return members, provided only that it was\r\ncertain they would return Protestants. Nineteen of the thirty-nine new\r\nboroughs were situated in Ulster, where the plantations had given the\r\nEnglish and Scotch settlers a preponderance. In the House of Lords the\r\nsituation was also critical, but it was hoped that by summoning all\r\nthe Protestant bishops and also certain peers of England who had got\r\ngrants of territory in Ireland the government could count on a\r\nmajority, especially as some of the Catholic lords were minors, and as\r\nsuch not entitled to sit. For months the plans for packing the\r\nParliament and for preparing a scheme of anti-Catholic legislation\r\nwere being concocted, and the Catholic lords, knowing well what was\r\ngoing on, felt so alarmed that they lodged a solemn protest with the\r\nking against the erection of towns and corporations \"consisting of\r\nsome few poor and beggarly cottages\" into parliamentary boroughs,\r\nagainst the wholesale exclusion of Catholics from office on account of\r\ntheir religion, and conjured the king \"to give order that the\r\nproceedings of Parliament may be conducted with moderation and\r\nindifferency.\" In spite of this protest the new boroughs were created,\r\nand the elections were carried out in the most high-handed manner, the\r\nsheriffs hesitating at nothing so long as they could secure the\r\nnomination of Protestant representatives.\r\n\r\nOn the day preceding the opening of Parliament (fixed for 18th May\r\n1613) the Catholic Lords of the Pale addressed a protest to the Lord\r\nDeputy. They asserted that while several of the Irish Catholic nobles\r\nentitled to sit in the House of Lords were not summoned, English and\r\nScotch lords \"already parliant in other kingdoms\" had been invited to\r\nattend, that new corporations had been created, many of them since\r\nParliament was summoned, without any right or title except to assure a\r\nProtestant majority, that the sheriffs and returning officers had\r\nacted most unfairly during the election, and that a Parliament sitting\r\n\"in the principal fort and castle of the kingdom,\" surrounded by\r\n\"numbers of armed men,\" could not be regarded as a free assembly. When\r\nthe House of Commons met on the following day the Catholics proposed\r\nthat Sir John Everard, who had been dismissed from his office of judge\r\nbecause he refused the oath of supremacy, should be elected speaker,\r\nwhile the Protestants proposed Sir John Davies for this position. The\r\nCatholics, knowing well that if the returns of the sheriffs were\r\naccepted they would find themselves in the minority, maintained that\r\nthe members against whose return objection had been lodged should not\r\nbe allowed to vote. On this being refused, they tried to prevent a\r\nvote being taken, and when the supporters of Davies left the chamber\r\nto take a count, the Catholics installed Sir John Everard in the\r\nchair. The Protestants, claiming that they had a clear majority, one\r\nhundred and twenty-seven out of a possible two hundred and thirty-two,\r\nremoved Sir John Everard by force, and adopted Sir John Davies as\r\nspeaker. The Catholics then left the chamber, and both Lords and\r\nCommoners refused to attend any further sessions until they should\r\nhave laid their grievances before the king. In consequence of their\r\nrefusal it was necessary to suspend the parliamentary session, and\r\nboth parties directed all their attention to an appeal to the king.\r\nThe Catholics sent to London as their representatives, Lords\r\nGormanston and Dunboyne, Sir James Gough and Sir Christopher Plunkett,\r\nWilliam Talbot and Edward FitzHarris, and a general levy was made\r\nthroughout the kingdom to raise money to pay their expenses. A great\r\ndeal of time was wasted in inquiries in London and in Ireland. James\r\nfound it difficult to decide against the Lord Deputy, while at the\r\nsame time he could not shut his eyes to the justice of several of the\r\nclaimants brought under his notice by the Catholics. At one time he\r\npromised their delegates that he would not interfere with the free\r\nexercise of their religion provided they admitted it was not lawful to\r\ndeprive him of his crown or to offer violence to his person, but when\r\nthe Lord Deputy wrote warning him of the effect this speech had\r\nproduced in Ireland, James, while not denying that he had used the\r\nwords attributed to him, issued a proclamation announcing that he\r\nwould never grant religious toleration, and ordering all bishops,\r\nJesuits, friars, and priests to depart from the kingdom before the\r\n30th of September (1614). In April 1614 the king decided to annul\r\nthirteen of the returns impeached by the Catholics, but in regard to\r\nthe other matters of complaint he gave judgment in favour of the Lord\r\nDeputy. In a personal interview with the Catholic lords he pointed out\r\nthat it was his privilege to create as many peers and parliamentary\r\nboroughs as he liked. \"The more the merrier, the fewer the better\r\ncheer.\" He informed them, too, that they were only half subjects so\r\nlong as they acknowledged the Pope, and could, therefore, expect to\r\nhave only half privileges, and expressed the hope that by their future\r\ngood behaviour in Parliament they might merit not only his pardon but\r\n\"his favour and cherishing.\"\r\n\r\nIn October 1614 Parliament was at last ready to proceed with its\r\nbusiness. During the course of the negotiations it would appear that\r\nthe plan of passing new penal legislation against Catholics was\r\nabandoned. It was intended at first to enact a very severe measure for\r\nthe expulsion of Jesuits and seminary priests, and another framed with\r\nthe intention of making the laws against Catholics in England binding\r\nin Ireland. But these clauses were struck out, probably as a result of\r\na bargain between the Catholic lords and the king. In return for this\r\ntoleration the Catholic lords agreed to support the Act of Attainder\r\npassed against O'Neill and O'Donnell, together with their aiders and\r\nabettors, and to approve of the wholesale confiscation that had taken\r\nplace in Ulster. In vain did Florence Conry, Archbishop of Tuam, call\r\nupon the Catholic members to stand firm against such injustice. His\r\nwarning, that if they consented to the robbery of their\r\nco-religionists of the North their own turn to be robbed would surely\r\ncome, fell upon deaf ears. Their loyalty to England had nerved them to\r\ndraw their swords against O'Neill, and it nerved them also to assist\r\nChichester and Davies to carry on the Ulster Plantations. Well might\r\nthe latter boast in his letter to the Earl of Somerset that the\r\nservice performed by this Parliament was \"of such importance, as\r\ngreater has not been effected in any Parliament of Ireland these\r\nhundred years. For, first, the new erected boroughs have taken place,\r\nwhich will be perpetual seminaries of Protestant burgesses, since it\r\nis provided in the charters that the provost and twelve chief\r\nburgesses, who are to elect all the rest, must always be such as will\r\ntake the Oath of Supremacy. Next, all the states of the kingdom have\r\nattainted Tyrone, the most notorious and dangerous traitor that ever\r\nwas in Ireland, whereof foreign nations will take notice, because it\r\nhas been given out that Tyrone had left many friends behind him, and\r\nthat only the Protestants wished his utter ruin. Besides, this\r\nattainder settles the Plantation of Ulster.\"[31]\r\n\r\nChichester, who had planned the Plantation of Ulster, and who had\r\nenriched himself out of the spoils of the Northern princes, was\r\nremoved from office in 1615, and was succeeded by Sir Oliver St. John,\r\nwho came to Ireland determined to support the anti-Catholic campaign.\r\nIn a short time more than eighty of the best citizens of Dublin were\r\nin prison because they refused the oath of supremacy, and throughout\r\nthe country, jurors who refused to convict the Catholics were\r\nthemselves held prisoners, so that the jails were soon full to\r\noverflowing. Immense sums were levied off both poor and rich for non-\r\nattendance at Protestant religious service. In the County Cavan, for\r\nexample, the fines for one year amounted to about £8,000,[32] while\r\nlarge sums were paid by the Catholic noblemen for protection from the\r\nProtestant inquisitors. New plantations were undertaken, on the lines\r\nof the Ulster Plantation, in Wexford, Longford, King's County, and\r\nLeitrim, though, not having been carried out so thoroughly or so\r\nsystematically as the former, they had not the same measure of\r\nsuccess. All Catholic noblemen succeeding to property were obliged to\r\ntake the oath of supremacy, though apparently they could procure\r\nexemption from this test by the payment of a fine, but the Court of\r\nWards took care that minors should be entrusted to Protestant\r\nguardians, and should be sent if possible to Trinity College. By means\r\nsuch as these Elizabeth and James succeeded in Protestantising a\r\ncertain number of the heirs to Irish estates. Proclamations were\r\nissued once more against the clergy, both secular and regular, and so\r\nviolent was the persecution that the Bishops of Ireland addressed a\r\npetition to the Catholic rulers of Europe, and especially to the King\r\nof Spain, asking them to intercede with James on behalf of his Irish\r\nCatholic subjects (1617).[33]\r\n\r\nThe negotiations for the marriage of Prince Charles to a Spanish\r\nprincess made it necessary for the king to be more guarded in his\r\nreligious policy in Ireland. Oliver St. John, who had shown himself to\r\nbe such a bitter enemy of the Catholics, was removed from office, and\r\nLord Falkland was sent over as Deputy in 1622. Rumours were afloat on\r\nall sides that his policy was to be one of toleration. The Protestants\r\nwere alarmed and at the installation of the new Deputy (Sept. 1622)\r\nJames Ussher, then Protestant Bishop of Meath, taking as his text, \"He\r\nbeareth not the sword in vain,\" preached a violent sermon in favour of\r\nreligious persecution. Primate Hampton wrote immediately to the\r\npreacher, reproving him for his imprudence, asking him to explain away\r\nwhat he had said about the sword, and advising him to spend more of\r\nhis time in his own diocese of Meath, where matters were far from\r\nbeing satisfactory.[34] On the return of Charles from Spain a new\r\nproclamation was issued (1624) ordering all \"titulary popish\r\narchbishops, bishops, vicars-general, abbots, priors, deans, Jesuits,\r\nfriars, seminary priests, and others of that sect, made or ordained by\r\nauthority derived from the See of Rome or other foreign parts to\r\ndepart from the kingdom within forty days under pain of his Majesty's\r\nindignation and penalties. If any of these dared to remain, or if any\r\npersons dared to receive them, the offenders were to be lodged in\r\nprison, \"to the end such further order may be taken for their\r\npunishment as by us shall be thought fit.\"[35]\r\n\r\nA full account of the position of the Catholics of Ireland is given in\r\na letter written from Dublin in 1623. Catholic minors were compelled\r\nto accept the oath of supremacy before they could get letters of\r\nfreedom from the Court of Wards (established 1617); all mayors,\r\nmagistrates, officials, etc., of corporate towns were commanded to\r\ntake the oath under penalty of having their towns disenfranchised;\r\npriests were arrested and kept in prison; laymen were punished by\r\nsentences of excommunication and by fines for non-attendance at\r\nProtestant worship; they were summoned before the consistorial courts\r\nfor having had their children baptised by the priests and were\r\npunished with the greatest indignities; Catholics were forbidden to\r\nteach school and Catholic parents were forbidden to send their\r\nchildren abroad; the Catholic inhabitants of Drogheda were indicted\r\nbefore a Protestant jury, and having been found guilty of recusancy,\r\nthey stood in danger of having all their property forfeited; in Louth\r\nthe juries were ordered to draw up a list of Recusants; when three\r\nCatholic jurors refused they were thrown into prison and obliged to\r\ngive security to appear before the Dublin Star Chamber; and in Cavan\r\nproceedings of a similar kind were taken.[36]\r\n\r\nAmongst the distinguished bishops of the Irish Church at this period\r\nwere Peter Lombard, Archbishop of Armagh (1601-25), a native of\r\nWaterford, who studied at Oxford and Louvain, was appointed a\r\nprofessor at the latter seat of learning, took a very prominent part\r\nin the /Congregatio de Auxiliis/, published some theological treatises\r\ntogether with an ecclesiastical history of Ireland, entitled, /De\r\nRegno Hiberniae, Sanctorum insula, Commentarius/,[37] but who on\r\naccount of the danger of stirring up still greater persecution never\r\nvisited his diocese; Eugene Matthews or MacMahon, Bishop of Clogher\r\n(1609) and Archbishop of Dublin (1611) who did splendid work for the\r\nIrish Church by the decrees passed in the provincial synod at Kilkenny\r\n(1614) as well as by his successful efforts for the foundation of the\r\nPastoral College at Louvain; David O'Kearney, appointed to Cashel\r\n(1603) as successor to the martyred Archbishop O'Hurley, who though\r\nhunted from place to place continued to fill the duties of his office\r\ntill about the year 1618, when he went to Rome; and Florence Conry,\r\nArchbishop of Tuam, a Franciscan, who served with the army of the\r\nNorthern Princes, and who was specially detested by the English\r\ngovernment on account of his loyal defence of O'Neill. Not being\r\nallowed to return to Ireland, he devoted himself to the study of\r\ntheology, and was the author of several very important works, some of\r\nwhich were not, however, free from the suspicion of something akin to\r\nJansenism. By far the most useful book he composed was his celebrated\r\nIrish Catechism published at Louvain in 1626.[38]\r\n\r\nDuring the opening years of the reign of Charles I. (1625-49) the\r\npersecution was much less violent, and as Charles was married to a\r\nFrench Catholic princess and as he had promised solemnly not to\r\nenforce the laws against Catholics, it was hoped that at long last\r\nthey might expect toleration. The distinguished Franciscan Thomas\r\nFleming, son of the Baron of Slane, who had received his education in\r\nthe Irish Franciscan College at Louvain, was appointed Archbishop of\r\nDublin (1623), and arrived in Ireland two years later. He was able to\r\nreport that the conduct of the Catholics not only in Dublin but\r\nthroughout Ireland was worthy of every praise, and to point to the\r\nfact that many who made the pilgrimage to St. Patrick's Purgatory in\r\nLough Derg were obliged to return without satisfying their pious\r\ndesires because the island was so crowded that there was no room for\r\nthem to land. Chapels were opened in some of the less pretentious\r\nstreets in Dublin; communities of religious orders took up fixed\r\nresidences in the capital; and the Jesuits summoned home some of their\r\nablest teachers to man a Catholic University which they opened in Back\r\nLane (1627). The government stood in need of money to equip and\r\nsupport a new army, then considered necessary on account of the\r\nthreatening attitude of France, and in order to obtain funds a large\r\nbody both of the Protestant and Catholic nobility were invited to come\r\nto Dublin for discussion. They were offered certain concessions or\r\n\"Graces\" in return for a subsidy, and to placate the Catholic peers it\r\nwas said that the fines for non-attendance at church would not be\r\nlevied, and that they might expect tacit toleration.\r\n\r\nThe very mention of toleration filled the Protestant bishops with\r\nalarm, and, considering the fact that they were dependent upon\r\ncoercion for whatever congregations they had, their rage is not\r\nunintelligible. James Ussher, who had become Protestant Primate of\r\nArmagh, convoked an assembly of the bishops. They declared that: \"The\r\nreligion of the Papists is superstitious and idolatrous, their church\r\nin respect of both, apostatical. To give them, therefore, a\r\ntoleration, or to consent that they may freely exercise their\r\nreligion, and profess their faith and doctrine is a grievous sin, and\r\nthat in two respects. For it is to make ourselves accessory, not only\r\nto their superstitions, idolatries, and heresies, and in a word, to\r\nall the abominations of Popery; but also, which is a consequent of the\r\nformer, to the perdition of the seduced people, which perish in the\r\ndeluge of Catholic apostacy. To grant them toleration, in respect of\r\nany money to be given, or contribution to be made by them, is to set\r\nreligion to sale, and with it, the souls of the people, whom Christ\r\nour Saviour hath redeemed with His most precious blood.\"[39] The Irish\r\ndeputies arrived in London to seek a confirmation of the \"Graces\" at\r\nthe very time that the third Parliament of Charles (1627) was\r\npetitioning him to put in force the laws against the Recusants. The\r\nmembers of the English House of Commons complained that religious\r\ncommunities of men and women had been set up in Dublin and in several\r\nof the larger cities, that Ireland was swarming with Jesuits, friars,\r\nand priests, that the people who attended formerly the Protestant\r\nservice had ceased to attend, that in Dublin there were thirteen mass-\r\nhouses, and that Papists were allowed to act as army officers, and\r\nPapists were being trained as soldiers.\"[40] In these circumstances\r\nthe Catholic members of the deputation consented to abandon their\r\nclaims for full toleration, though it was understood that the fines\r\nlevied on account of absence from Protestant service would not be\r\nenforced, but they were promised that Catholic lawyers would be\r\nallowed to practise without being obliged to take the oath of\r\nsupremacy. In return for the promised \"Graces,\" which were to be\r\nratified immediately in Parliament, the Irish nobles promised to pay a\r\nsum of £120,000 for the support of the new army.\r\n\r\nThe promised Parliament was not held, nor were the \"Graces\" conceded\r\neither to the Irish generally or to the Catholics. Still, there was no\r\nactive persecution for some time. The provincial of the Carmelites in\r\nDublin was able to report to the Propaganda (1629) that \"all the\r\necclesiastics now publicly perform their sacred functions, and prepare\r\nsuitable places for offering the holy sacrifice, and that with open\r\ndoors; they now preach to the people, say Mass, and discharge all\r\ntheir other duties without being molested by any one.\" The Carmelites,\r\nhe wrote, \"had a large church, but not sufficient to contain one-sixth\r\nof the congregation; the people flocked in crowds to Confession, and\r\nHoly Communion; the Franciscans, Dominicans, Capuchins, and Jesuits\r\nwere hard at work; and the parishes were supplied with parish priests\r\nwho resided in their districts and were supported by the voluntary\r\nofferings of the people.\"[41] From a report of the year 1627, it is\r\nclear that the Dominicans had over fifty priests of their Order in\r\nIreland, together with several novices and students.[42]\r\n\r\nBut already the enemies of the Catholic religion were at work, and, as\r\na result, a proclamation was issued by Lord Falkland in 1629\r\ncommanding that all monasteries, convents, colleges, and religious\r\nhouses should be dissolved, that all religious and priests should\r\ncease to teach or to perform any religious service in any public\r\nchapel or oratory, or to teach in any place whatsoever in the kingdom,\r\nand that all owners of religious houses and schools should apply them\r\nto other uses without delay (1629). At first no notice was taken of\r\nthis proclamation in Dublin or in any of the cities of Ireland. Ussher\r\nwrote to complain of the \"unreverend manner\" in which the proclamation\r\nwas made in Drogheda. \"It was done in scornful and contemptuous sort,\r\na drunken soldier being first set up to read it, and then a drunken\r\nsergeant of the town, making the same to seem like a May-game.\" The\r\npriests and friars merely closed the front doors of the churches, he\r\nsaid, but the people flocked to the churches as usual by private\r\npassages.[43] Lord Falkland does not seem to have made any determined\r\neffort to carry out the royal proclamation in Dublin, but\r\nunfortunately he was recalled in 1629, and in the interval from his\r\ndeparture till the arrival of Sir Thomas Wentworth (1632) Loftus,\r\nViscount of Ely, and Lord Cork were appointed as Lords Justices.\r\nImmediately the persecution began. The Protestant Archbishop of\r\nDublin, accompanied by a body of soldiers, made a raid upon the\r\nCarmelite Church in Cook Street while Mass was being celebrated on St.\r\nStephen's Day, destroyed the altar and statues, and seized two of the\r\npriests; but the people set upon the archbishop and the soldiers, and\r\nrescued the prisoners. The troops were called out at once, and several\r\nof the Dublin aldermen were lodged in prison. Most of the churches\r\nwere seized, and the Jesuit University was given over to Trinity\r\nCollege. Attacks of a similar kind were made on the houses and\r\nchurches of the regular clergy in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, and in\r\nvarious other parts of the country. An order was issued by the Lords\r\nJustices that St. Patrick's Purgatory together \"with St. Patrick's bed\r\nand all the vaults, cells, and all other houses and buildings should\r\nbe demolished, and that the superstitious stones and material should\r\nbe cast into the lough.\" Catholic deputies hastened to London to lay\r\ntheir grievances before the king, but, though he was not unwilling to\r\nhelp them, he found it difficult to do much for them on account of the\r\nstrong anti-Catholic feeling in England. Queen Henrietta Maria did\r\nappeal to the new Deputy to restore St. Patrick's Purgatory, but, as\r\nit was situated \"in the midst of the great Scottish Plantation,\" he\r\nfeared to grant her request at the time. Lord Cork reported that \"he\r\nhad set up two houses of correction in dissolved friaries, in which\r\nthe beggarly youths are taught trades.\" But soon the king and\r\nWentworth grew alarmed about the storm that the justices were creating\r\nin Ireland. The Catholic lords threatened that unless an end were put\r\nto the persecution, which was contrary to the \"Graces\" that had been\r\npromised, they would refuse to pay the subsidy they had promised, and\r\nletters were sent both by the king and Wentworth throwing the blame on\r\nLoftus and Lord Cork, and reproving them for what they had done.[44]\r\n\r\nIn 1632 Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, arrived in\r\nIreland as Lord Deputy. He was a strong man, intensely devoted to the\r\nking, and determined to reduce all parties in Ireland to subjection.\r\nIn religion he was a High Churchman of the school of Laud, and opposed\r\nto the Scotch Presbyterians of the North of Island almost as much as\r\nto the Irish Catholics. From the beginning he was determined to raise\r\nthe revenues of the crown in Ireland, to establish a strong standing\r\narmy, and to secure the future peace of the country by carrying out a\r\nscheme of plantations in Connaught and Munster along the lines\r\nfollowed by the advisers of James I. in case of Ulster. One of his\r\nfirst acts after his arrival in Ireland was to commission Dr. John\r\nBramhall, afterwards Protestant Bishop of Derry and Primate, to hold\r\nan inquiry into the state of the Protestant Church. The latter, after\r\nhaving made some investigations, informed Archbishop Laud that he\r\nfound it difficult to say \"whether the churches were more ruinous and\r\nsordid or the people irreverent in Dublin,\" that one parochial church\r\nin Dublin had been converted into a stable, another had become a\r\nnobleman's mansion, while a third was being used as a tennis-court, of\r\nwhich the vicar acted as keeper. The vaults of Christ's Church had\r\nbeen leased to Papists \"as tippling rooms for beer, wine, and\r\ntobacco,\" so that the congregation stood in danger of being poisoned\r\nby the fumes, and the table for the administration of Holy Communion\r\nwas made \"an ordinary seat for maids and apprentices.\" \"The inferior\r\nsorts of ministers were below all degrees of contempt, in respect of\r\ntheir poverty and their ignorance,\" and it was told him that one\r\nbishop held three and twenty benefices with care of souls.[45]\r\n\r\nWentworth lost no time in trying to raise money for the army, but many\r\nof the lords, both Catholic and Protestant, were so annoyed at the\r\nrefusal to confirm the \"Graces\" and at the delay in calling the\r\nParliament that had been promised, that Wentworth was forced to make\r\nsome concession. Parliament was convoked to meet in 1634, and the Lord\r\nDeputy nominated his own supporters in the boroughs, so as to counter-\r\nbalance the representation from the counties, which representation he\r\ncould not in all cases control. The Catholics were strong in the Lower\r\nHouse particularly, but care was taken that they should be in a\r\nminority. The main question was the granting of subsidies, but several\r\nof the Protestants and all the Catholics demanded that the \"Graces\"\r\nshould first be confirmed. Both Protestant and Catholic landowners\r\nwere interested in safeguarding the titles to their property by having\r\nit enacted that sixty years' possession should be regarded as a\r\nsufficient proof of ownership. As such an enactment would have upset\r\nall Wentworth's plans for a wholesale plantation, he succeeded in\r\nresisting such a measure, and partly by threats, partly by underhand\r\ndealings with particular individuals he obtained a grant of generous\r\nsubsidies without any confirmation of the \"Graces.\" In April 1635\r\nParliament was dissolved, and almost immediately the Lord Deputy made\r\npreparations for acting under the commission for inquiring into\r\ndefective titles granted to him by the king. \"All the Protestants are\r\nfor plantations,\" he wrote, \"and all the others are against them. If\r\nthe Catholic juries refuse to find a verdict in favour of the king,\r\nthen recourse must be had to Parliament, where a Protestant majority\r\nis assured.\" Portions of Tipperary, Clare, and Kilkenny were secured\r\nwithout much difficulty, but nothing less than the whole of Connaught\r\nwould satisfy the Deputy. Roscommon was the first county selected, and\r\nthe Commissioners, including the Lord Deputy, arrived in Boyle to hold\r\nthe inquiry (July 1635). The jury, having been informed by Wentworth\r\nthat, whether they found in his favour or not, the king was determined\r\nto assert his claims to their county, and that their only hope of\r\nmercy was their prompt obedience, delivered the required verdict.\r\nSligo and Mayo also made their submission. In Galway, however, the\r\njury found against the king. In consequence of this the sheriff was\r\nfined £1,000 and placed under bail to appear before the Star Chamber,\r\nand the jurymen were threatened with severe punishment. They were\r\nfined £4,000 each and ordered to be imprisoned till they should pay\r\nthe full amount. In this way the whole of Connaught, with the\r\nexception of Leitrim which was planted already, together with a great\r\npart of Clare, Tipperary, and Kilkenny was confiscated to the crown.\r\nBut Wentworth postponed the plantation of Connaught to a more\r\nfavourable period, and before any such period arrived he had lost both\r\nhis office and his head. The danger to Charles I. from the Scotch\r\nCovenanters was already apparent, and Charles urged his Deputy to\r\nraise an army in Ireland. During the years 1639 and 1640 the work of\r\ntraining the army, many of the officers of which and most of the\r\nsoldiers, were Catholics, was pushed forward, but the triumph of the\r\nScots and the execution of the Earl of Strafford in April 1641 made it\r\nimpossible to use it for the purpose for which it was designed. Acting\r\non the instigation of the English Parliament, Charles sent an order\r\nthat the Irish troops should be disbanded, and added that he had\r\nlicensed certain officers to transport eight thousand troops to the\r\naid of any of the sovereigns of Europe friendly to England. For one\r\nreason or another very few of the soldiers left Ireland, as both their\r\nown leaders and the king knew well that their services would be soon\r\nrequired at home. Parliament had met in Ireland in March 1640,[46]\r\nand, having voted several subsidies to aid the king, it adjourned.\r\nWhen it met again in 1641 the Catholics were actually in the majority,\r\nand seemed determined to hold their own. The king wrote to confirm the\r\n\"Graces,\" and to suggest that a bill should be introduced to confirm\r\ndefective titles in Tipperary, Clare, and Connaught, but the\r\nobstructive tactics of the Earl of Ormond, and the unfavourable\r\nattitude of the Lords Justices, Sir William Parsons and Sir William\r\nBorlase, towards Catholic claims, prevented anything being done.\r\nParliament was adjourned till the 9th November, but before that date\r\narrived the issues had been transferred to another and a different\r\ncourt.[47]\r\n\r\nFrom 1632 till 1640, though the Deputy was doing his best to rob a\r\nlarge portion of the Catholic owners of their property on the ground\r\nof defective titles, and though in many districts the Protestant\r\nbishops and ministers created considerable difficulties for their\r\nCatholic neighbours, still the religious persecution was carried out\r\nonly in a half-hearted manner. The king was shrewd enough to recognise\r\nthe important part that might be played by the Irish Catholics in the\r\ncivil struggle that he foresaw, and he was anxious not to antagonise\r\ntheir leaders. This period of comparative calm was providential for\r\nthe Church in Ireland, by enabling it to organise its forces and to\r\nprepare for the terrible days that were soon to come. In accordance\r\nwith the advice given by Archbishop Lombard years before, Rome decided\r\nto fill several of the Sees that had been left vacant. Hugh\r\nMacCaghwell (/Cavellus/), a distinguished Irish Franciscan, who had\r\nbeen instrumental in founding the College of St. Anthony at Louvain,\r\nand whose theological works caused him to be regarded by his\r\ncontemporaries as the ablest theologian of the Scotish school in\r\nEurope, was appointed Archbishop of Armagh (1626), but he died in Rome\r\na few weeks after his consecration. Less than two years later it was\r\ndecided to transfer Hugh O'Reilly from Kilmore to the primatial See\r\n(1628). Thomas Fleming had been appointed to Dublin in 1623, and\r\ndespite the efforts of his enemies he succeeded in eluding the\r\nvigilance of those who wished to drive him from Ireland. Malachy\r\nO'Queely, who had acted for years as vicar-apostolic of his native\r\ndiocese of Killaloe, was appointed to Tuam (1630) in succession to\r\nFlorence Conry, and Thomas Walsh, a native of Waterford, was promoted\r\nto the See of Cashel (1626). Amongst the distinguished ecclesiastics\r\nwho were promoted to Irish dioceses during the reign of James I. and\r\nCharles, were the learned David Rothe (Ossory, 1618), Roche MacGeoghan\r\n(/Roccus de Cruce/), who had done so much for the restoration of the\r\nDominican houses in Ireland (Kildare, 1629), and Heber MacMahon (Down,\r\n1642, Clogher, 1643). As a result of the long persecution and of the\r\nabsence of bishops from so many dioceses a certain amount of\r\ndisorganisation might be detected in several departments, and to\r\nremedy this provincial synods were held to lay down new regulations,\r\nand to adjust the position of the Church to the altered circumstances\r\nof the country. A synod was held at Kilkenny (1627) which was attended\r\nby bishops from Leinster and Munster; another very important one, the\r\ndecrees of which were confirmed by the Holy See, was held for the\r\nprovince of Tuam in 1632, and a third attended by the Leinster bishops\r\nwas held in the County Kilkenny in 1640.[48] The Irish colleges on the\r\nContinent continued to pour able and zealous young priests into the\r\ncountry, while the colleges for the education of the Franciscans,\r\nDominicans, and Jesuits supplied new recruits to replenish the ranks\r\nof the religious orders. The Capuchin founded Irish colleges on the\r\nContinent, at Lille, Antwerp, and at Sedan, and so earnestly did they\r\nwork in Ireland that a special letter in praise of the Capuchins was\r\nforwarded to Rome by a number of the Bishops in 1642. The results of\r\nthis renewed activity were soon apparent in every part of the country.\r\nThus, for example, in a report presented (1631) from the diocese of\r\nElphin, then ruled by Bishop Boetius Egan, it can be seen that\r\nalthough all the churches, including the cathedral, had been destroyed\r\nor taken possession of by the Protestants, there were at the time\r\nforty priests at work in the diocese; the decrees of the Council of\r\nTrent had been promulgated; the parishes had been re-arranged, and the\r\nlearning of the parish priests appointed had been tested by\r\nexamination; regular synods, visitations, and conferences of the\r\nclergy were being held, and steps had been taken to ensure that the\r\npeople should be instructed fully in their religion.[49]\r\n\r\nIn the Parliament of 1641 the Catholics were in the majority, and they\r\ninsisted that the \"Graces\" must be confirmed. The king granted their\r\ndemands, and the bill was actually on its way to Ireland when the\r\nLords Justices, Parsons and Borlase, who administered the government\r\nof the country prorogued the session. They wished for no settlement\r\nwith the Catholics lest a settlement might put an end to their hopes\r\nof a plantation, and the Earl of Ormond tried also to block the\r\npassage of the bill in the hope of saving the king from the odium\r\nwhich he would incur in England and Scotland by granting toleration to\r\nthe Irish Catholics. The Catholic noblemen of Ireland, whether Irish\r\nor Anglo-Irish, had good reason to complain. They had seen the\r\nCatholics driven out of the good lands of Ulster to make way for\r\nEnglish and Scottish planters, and they well knew that the danger of\r\nsimilar transactions in Connaught, Munster, and Leinster had not\r\npassed away with the death of Strafford. They had seen the operation\r\nof the Court of Wards, and they could not fail to realise that as a\r\nresult of its work the landowners of Ireland would soon be\r\ndispossessed or Protestantised. They knew something of the Protestant\r\nInquisition courts as run by the ministers and bishops, of the\r\npersecution of their clergy, the fees and fines levied on the\r\nunfortunate Catholic peasantry, and of the still graver danger that\r\nlay before them in case the Covenanters and the Puritans were to\r\noverthrow Charles I., or to succeed in forcing him to accept their\r\npolicy. Were they to remain passive, they believed, they could have no\r\nhope of redress or even of safety, and hence many of them made up\r\ntheir minds that the time for negotiations had passed, and that they\r\ncould rely only on force. Never again were they likely to get such a\r\nfavourable opportunity. England was torn by internal dissensions; the\r\ndisbanded Irish soldiers, who had been trained for service against the\r\nScots, were still in the country; and with so many distinguished\r\nIrishmen scattered through the countries of Europe there was good hope\r\nthat they might get assistance from their co-religionists on the\r\nContinent. The distinguished Waterford Franciscan, Father Luke\r\nWadding, who had founded the College of St. Isidore in Rome and had\r\ntaken such a prominent part in the foundation of the Irish College,\r\nwas in Rome ready to plead the cause of his countrymen at the Papal\r\nCourt. His fame as a scholar was known throughout Europe, and his\r\nactive support could not fail to produce its effect in Europe, and\r\nparticularly in Spain where he was esteemed so highly by Philip IV.\r\nOwen Roe O'Neill, who had achieved a remarkable distinction in the\r\narmy of Spain by his gallant defence of Arras against the French,\r\nColonel Preston, uncle of Lord Gormanston, and a host of others, who\r\nhad learned the art of war in France, Spain, and the Netherlands, were\r\nwilling to return to Ireland and to place their swords at the disposal\r\nof their country.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1641[50] Rory O'More, who was closely connected with both the\r\nIrish and the Anglo-Irish nobles, suggested to Lord Maguire of\r\nEnniskillen the idea of an appeal to arms, and hinted at the\r\npossibility of a union between the Irish nobles and the Lords of the\r\nPale. In a short time most of the important leaders of the North, Sir\r\nPhelim O'Neill, Turlogh O'Neill, Lord Maguire, Hugh MacMahon, Arthur\r\nMacGennis of Down, Philip and Miles O'Reilly of Cavan had come to an\r\nunderstanding. The war was to begin in Ulster on the night of the 23rd\r\nOctober 1641, and on the same night an attempt was made to seize\r\nDublin Castle. The latter portion of the programme could not be\r\ncarried out owing to the action of an informer who betrayed Maguire\r\nand Hugh MacMahon to the Lords Justices; but at the appointed time the\r\nIrish Catholics of Ulster rose almost to a man, and in a very short\r\ntime most of the strong places in the province were in their hands. In\r\nsuch a movement it was almost impossible for the leaders to prevent\r\nsome excesses, particularly as many of the men who took part in it had\r\nbeen driven from their lands to make way for the Planters, and had\r\nsuffered terribly from the harshness and cruelty to which they and\r\ntheir families had been subjected. Naturally they seized their own\r\nagain, and in some cases they may have used more violence than the\r\nsituation required, but it is now admitted by impartial historians[51]\r\nthat the wild stories of a wholesale massacre of Protestants are\r\nwithout any more solid foundation than the fact that the Protestants\r\nwere for the most part driven out of Ulster in much the same way as\r\nthe Catholics had been driven to the mountains thirty years before.\r\nMost of the few who were killed were probably struck down while\r\nattempting to defend their homes, and in no case is there evidence to\r\nprove that the leaders countenanced unnecessary violence or murder. If\r\nthe historian wishes to look for organised lawlessness and murder he\r\ncan find it much more easily in the campaign of the infamous Sir\r\nCharles Coote or in the raids carried out by the forces of the Scotch\r\nCovenanters of the North. The Catholic Lords of the Pale hastened to\r\nDublin Castle to offer their services against the Northern rebels, but\r\nthey were received so discourteously by the Lords Justices that they\r\nrecognised the absolute necessity of joining with the Catholics of\r\nUlster. In announcing their defection the Lords Justices positively\r\ngloated over the splendid prospect of having the province of Leinster\r\nplanted with English settlers (Dec. 1641).[52] The action of the\r\nEnglish Parliament in decreeing that for the future there should be no\r\ntoleration allowed to Irish Catholics (Dec. 1641) and in putting up\r\nfor sale two million five hundred thousand acres of fertile land in\r\nIreland, the proceeds to be expended in a war of extermination,\r\nstrengthened the hands of the Irish leaders, and helped to bring over\r\nthe waverers to their side.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic clergy had sympathised with the movement from the\r\nbeginning, but they had exerted themselves particularly in moderating\r\nthe fury of their countrymen, and in protecting the Protestants, both\r\nlaymen and clerics, from unnecessary violence.[53] But, as there was a\r\ndanger that the movement would break up and that the Irish forces\r\nwould be divided, it was necessary for the bishops to take action.\r\nReligion was nearly the only bond that was likely to unite the Irish\r\nand the Anglo-Irish nobles, and the Church was the only institution\r\nthat could give the movement unity and permanency. A meeting of the\r\nbishops and vicars of the Northern province was held at Kells (May\r\n1642) under the presidency of Dr. Hugh O'Reilly, Archbishop of Armagh.\r\nThey prescribed a three days' fast, the public recitation of the\r\nRosary and the Litanies, and a general Communion for the success of\r\nthe war, issued a sentence of excommunication against murderers,\r\nmutilators, thieves, robbers, etc., together with all their aiders and\r\nabettors, denounced the Catholic Irishmen who refused to make common\r\ncause with their countrymen, and ordered all bishops, vicars-general,\r\nparish priests, and heads of religious houses to spare no pains to\r\nraise funds immediately for the support of the soldiers.[54] In May\r\n(1642) a national synod was held at Kilkenny. It was attended by the\r\nPrimate of Armagh, the Archbishops of Tuam and Cashel, by most of the\r\nbishops either personally or by procurators, and by representatives of\r\nthe religious orders and of the secular clergy. They declared that the\r\nwar was being waged for the defence of the Catholic religion, for the\r\npreservation of the rights and prerogatives of the king, for the just\r\nand lawful immunities, liberties, and rights of Ireland, for the\r\nprotection of the lives, fortunes, goods, and possessions of the\r\nCatholics of Ireland, and that it was a just war in which all\r\nCatholics should join. They condemned murder, robbery, and violence,\r\nadvised all their countrymen to lay aside racial and provincial\r\ndifferences, took measures for the restoration of the cathedrals and\r\nchurches to their owners, exhorted all, both clergy and laymen, to\r\npreserve unity, and called upon the priests to offer up Mass at least\r\nonce a week for the success of the war.[55]\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1642 the war had spread into all parts of Ireland, and\r\nmost of the prominent nobles, with the exception of the Earl of\r\nClanrickard, had taken the field. Owen Row O'Neill and Colonel Preston\r\nhad arrived with some of the Irish veterans from the Continent, and\r\nhad brought with them supplies of arms and ammunition. Urban VIII. had\r\nforwarded a touching letter addressed to the clergy and people of\r\nIreland (Feb. 1642) and had contrived to send large supplies of\r\nweapons and powder. A general assembly of Irish Catholics was called\r\nto meet at Kilkenny in October 1642. There were present, eleven\r\nspiritual peers, fourteen lay peers, and two hundred and twenty-six\r\nrepresentatives from the cities and counties of Ireland, under the\r\npresidency of Lord Mountgarrett. Generals were appointed to lead the\r\nforces in the different provinces, as unfortunately owing to the\r\njealousy between the Anglo-Irish and the Irish nobles Owen Roe O'Neill\r\ncould not be appointed commander of the national army. Arrangements\r\nwere made for sending ambassadors to the principal courts of Europe,\r\nfor the establishment of a printing-press, for raising money, and for\r\nthe promotion of education. The Irish Franciscans of Louvain were\r\nasked to transfer their press and library to Ireland to help in the\r\ncreation of a great school of Irish learning. Father Luke Wadding was\r\nappointed the Irish representative at the Papal Court, and agents were\r\ndispatched to France, Spain, the Netherlands, and to several of the\r\nGerman States. Urban VIII., yielding to the entreaties of the Irish\r\nambassador gave generous assistance, and wrote to nearly all the\r\nCatholic rulers of Europe recommending them to assist their\r\nco-religionists in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn 1643 the well-known Oratorian, Father Francesco Scarampi, landed in\r\nWexford as the accredited agent of the Pope, bringing with him\r\nsupplies of money and arms. Hardly, however, had he arrived, when he\r\ndiscovered that though the Irish armies had met with considerable\r\nsuccess both against the Royalist forces in Dublin and the Scotch\r\nCovenanters in the North, negotiations had been opened up for an\r\nextended truce. The Anglo-Irish nobles had never been enthusiastic for\r\nthe war as an Irish war. They fought merely to preserve their estates\r\nand to secure a certain degree of liberty of worship, but in their\r\nhearts they were more anxious about the cause of the king than about\r\nthe cause of Ireland. The Marquis of Ormond, whom the king had created\r\nhis Lord Lieutenant in Ireland, had many friends amongst the Lords of\r\nthe Pale, and by means of his agents he succeeded in bringing about a\r\ncessation (Sept. 1643). The Irish Catholics were to send agents to the\r\nking for a full discussion of their grievances, and were to help him\r\nwith supplies. Anxious to secure the help of the Irish Catholics, and\r\nfearing to give a handle to his parliamentary opponents by granting\r\nreligious toleration, Charles was in a very difficult position, and to\r\nmake matters worse Ormond was determined not to yield to the demands\r\nof the Catholics. He was prepared to make a conditional promise that\r\nthe laws against them would not be enforced, but beyond that he was\r\nresolved not to go.\r\n\r\nAfter long and fruitless negotiations with Ormond the war was renewed\r\n(1644). Representatives from France and Spain had arrived in Kilkenny,\r\nand it was thought that if the Pope could be induced to send a nuncio\r\nsuch a measure would strengthen the hands of the Irish ambassadors on\r\nthe Continent. At the request of Sir Richard Bellings, Secretary to\r\nthe Supreme Council, Innocent X. consented to send Giovanni Battista\r\nRinuccini as his representative to Ireland (1645). The latter landed\r\nat Kenmare in October, and proceeded almost immediately to Kilkenny.\r\nIn the meantime Charles I. was being hard pressed in England, and as\r\nhe could have no hope of inducing Ormond to agree to such terms as\r\nwould satisfy the Catholics of Ireland, he commissioned the Earl of\r\nGlamorgan, himself a Catholic, and closely connected with some of the\r\nIrish families by marriage, to go to Kilkenny and to procure\r\nassistance from the Catholic Confederation at all costs. Shortly after\r\nhis arrival he concluded a treaty in the name of the king (Aug. 1645)\r\nin which he guaranteed \"the free and public exercise of the Roman\r\nCatholic religion.\" All churches possessed by the Irish Catholics at\r\nany time since October 1641 were to be left in their hands, and \"all\r\nchurches in Ireland other than such as are now actually enjoyed by his\r\nMajesty's Protestant subjects\" were to be given back to the Catholics.\r\nAll jurisdiction claimed by Protestant bishops or ministers over Irish\r\nCatholics was to be abolished, and all temporalities, possessed by the\r\nCatholic clergy since October 1641, were to be retained by them, two-\r\nthirds of the income, however, to be paid to the king during the\r\ncontinuance of the war. Charles had already addressed a letter to the\r\nnuncio promising to carry out whatever terms Glamorgan would concede,\r\nand adding the hope that though this was the first letter he had ever\r\nwritten to any minister of the Pope it would not be the last.[56] The\r\nterms were to be kept a secret, but in October 1645 Archbishop\r\nO'Queely of Tuam was killed near Sligo in a skirmish between the\r\nConfederate and Parliamentary forces, and a copy of the treaty which\r\nhe had in his possession fell into the hands of the enemy. As soon as\r\nit was published it created a great sensation in England, and Charles\r\nimmediately repudiated it. Glamorgan was arrested in Dublin by Ormond,\r\nbut was released after a few weeks, and returned coolly to Kilkenny to\r\nconduct further negotiations.\r\n\r\nSince his arrival in Kilkenny (1645) the nuncio was anxious to break\r\noff negotiations with Ormond, and to devote all the energies of the\r\ncountry to the prosecution of the war. But the Anglo-Irish of the Pale\r\nwere bent upon accepting any terms that Ormond might offer; and soon\r\nthe Supreme Council was divided into two sections, one favouring the\r\nnuncio, the other supporting Ormond. Negotiations had been opened\r\ndirectly with Rome by Queen Henrietta through her agent Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby. In return for promises of men and money the latter signed a\r\ntreaty even much more favourable to the Irish Catholics than that\r\nwhich had been concluded with Glamorgan (1645), but as the original of\r\nthis treaty had not come to hand, and as it was feared that there was\r\nlittle hope of its being put in force, the Supreme Council patched up\r\nan agreement with Ormond (March 1646). Although the latter had got a\r\nfree hand from the king he granted very little to the Catholics. The\r\noath of supremacy was to be abolished in the next Parliament, as were\r\nto be also all statutory penalties and disabilities; \"his Majesty's\r\nCatholic subjects were to be recommended to his Majesty's favour for\r\nfurther concessions;\" all educational disabilities of Catholics were\r\nto be removed, and all offices, civil and military, were to be thrown\r\nopen to them. Even this treaty was kept a secret, but in the meantime\r\nthe Confederation should send troops to the assistance of the king.\r\nBut before the troops could be sent Charles was driven to take refuge\r\nwith the Scots at Newcastle (May 1646), from which place he wrote\r\nforbidding Ormond \"to proceed further in treaty with the rebels or to\r\nmake any conditions with them.\"[57]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Rinuccini's earnest entreaties the majority of the\r\nSupreme Council insisted on accepting Ormond's terms. The\r\nConfederation had been so weakened by dissensions that General Monro\r\nthought he could march south and capture Kilkenny, but at Benburb he\r\nfound his way barred by the forces of O'Neill, and he was obliged to\r\nretreat to Coleraine, having left a great portion of his army dead on\r\nthe field, and his standards, guns, and supplies in the hands of\r\nO'Neill (5 June 1646). The news of the great victory was brought to\r\nthe nuncio at Limerick, where the captured banners were carried in\r\nprocession through the streets and deposited in the cathedral. General\r\nPreston had also scored some successes in Connaught, so that once\r\nagain the tide seemed to have turned in favour of the Confederates.\r\nRinuccini was more than ever determined to refuse half measures, such\r\nas were being offered by the terms of Ormond's treaty. He summoned a\r\nmeeting of the bishops in Waterford (Aug. 1646), and after long\r\ndiscussion it was agreed that those who accepted Ormond's terms were\r\nguilty of perjury, because they had thereby broken the terms of the\r\noath of confederation. According to this oath the members had pledged\r\nthemselves to be content with nothing less than the free and public\r\nexercise of their religion, while Ormond left nearly everything to the\r\ngood-will of the king, from whom nothing could be expected considering\r\nthe state of affairs in England. In spite of all remonstrances the\r\nSupreme Council published the Peace in Kilkenny, but their messengers\r\nwere refused admittance into several of the cities of the South.\r\nOrmond was invited to Kilkenny, where he received a royal reception\r\nfrom his friends. But O'Neill marched south and compelled Ormond to\r\nbeat a hasty retreat towards Dublin. Rinucinni returned to Kilkenny,\r\nand some of the prominent adherents of Ormond were arrested. A new\r\nSupreme Council was chosen, and O'Neill and Preston were commissioned\r\nto march on Dublin, but, though they brought their armies close to the\r\ncity, yet, owing to underhand communications carried on between\r\nOrmond's agent, the Earl of Clanrickard, and Preston, and the jealousy\r\nbetween the generals, the attack was not made.\r\n\r\nA new General Assembly had been elected and met at Kilkenny (10 Jan.\r\n1647). After a long discussion the Ormond Peace was condemned, and a\r\nnew form of oath was drawn up to be taken by all the Confederates.\r\nOrmond, who could have done so much for his master had he obeyed his\r\ninstructions and made some satisfactory offers to the Irish Catholics,\r\nsurrendered Dublin into the hands of the Parliamentarians, and fled to\r\nFrance. To make matters worse Preston was defeated by the\r\nParliamentarians at Summerhill (Aug. 1647), and Lord Inchiquin was\r\ncarrying all before him in the South. Everywhere he went he had acted\r\nwith great savagery, and was especially violent in his opposition to\r\nthe Catholic religion. But early in 1648 he changed his politics, and\r\ndeclared for the king against the Parliament. Immediately the former\r\nfriends of Ormond on the Supreme Council insisted on making terms with\r\nLord Inchiquin. Rinuccini opposed such a step as a betrayal, and his\r\naction was approved by a majority of the bishops. The nuncio left the\r\ncity and went towards Maryborough, where O'Neill was encamped. In May\r\n1648 the truce with Lord Inchiquin was proclaimed, and in a few days\r\nRinuccini issued a sentence of excommunication against all who would\r\nreceive it, and of interdict against the towns which recognised it.\r\nThe Supreme Council replied by appealing to the Pope. The only result\r\nwas that the division and confusion became more general. Several of\r\nthe bishops and clergy were to be found on both sides. The Supreme\r\nCouncil dismissed O'Neill from his office, and afterwards declared him\r\na traitor. The nuncio went to Galway, from which port he sailed in\r\n1649. Though it is difficult to entertain anything but the greatest\r\ncontempt for the Ormond faction on the Supreme Council, and though\r\nRinuccini was an honest man who did his best to carry out his\r\ninstructions, still he did not understand perfectly the situation. He\r\nallowed himself to show too openly his preference for O'Neill, and\r\ndisplayed too great an inclination to have recourse to high-handed\r\nmethods. His arrest of the Ormondist faction on the Supreme Council\r\nand the censures which he levelled against his opponents, however\r\njustifiable these things might have been in themselves, were not\r\ncalculated to restore unity and confidence.[58]\r\n\r\nOrmond returned to Ireland in 1648 and received a great welcome from\r\nthose of the Supreme Council who were opposed to Rinuccini and\r\nO'Neill. In January 1649 he concluded a peace with them by which he\r\nguaranteed that in the next Parliament to be held in Ireland the free\r\nexercise of the Catholic religion should be conceded; that the Act of\r\nUniformity and the Act of Royal Supremacy should be abolished; that\r\nall offices, civil and military, should be thrown open to Catholics\r\nprovided they were willing to take a simple oath of allegiance; that\r\nall plans for any further plantations in Munster, Leinster, and\r\nConnaught should be abandoned, that all Acts of Attainder, etc.,\r\npassed against Irish Catholics since October 1641 should be treated as\r\nnull and void; that the clergy should not be molested in regard to the\r\nchurches, church-livings, etc., until his Majesty upon full\r\nconsideration of the desires of the Catholics, formulated in a free\r\nParliament, should express his further pleasure; and that the regular\r\nclergy who would accept this peace should be allowed to continue to\r\nhold their houses and possessions. Further concessions were to be\r\ndependent on the king's wishes.[59] The Catholic Confederation as such\r\nwas dissolved, and Ormond was installed as Lord Lieutenant to govern\r\nthe country in conjunction with twelve Commissioners of Trust\r\nappointed by the Confederates. But O'Neill and his army still held out\r\nagainst any terms with Ormond, and a large number of the cities\r\nrefused to hold any communications with him. Still he hoped to capture\r\nDublin from the Parliamentarians before help could arrive from\r\nEngland, but he suffered a terrible defeat at Rathmines (2 Aug. 1649).\r\nLess than a fortnight later Oliver Cromwell[60] arrived in Dublin with\r\na large force to crush both the Royalists and the Catholics.\r\n\r\nCromwell, having taken a little time for his troops to recruit,\r\nmarched on Drogheda, then held for the king by Sir Arthur Aston, and\r\nso earnestly did he push forward the siege that in a short time he\r\ncarried the city by assault, and put most of the garrison and a large\r\nnumber of the citizens to death. Over a thousand were slaughtered in\r\nSt. Peter's Church to which they had fled for refuge, and special\r\nvengeance was meted out to the clergy, none of them who were\r\nrecognised being spared. Similar scenes of wholesale butchery took\r\nplace at Wexford, into which his army gained admission by\r\ntreachery.[61] Ormond was unable to make headway against such a\r\ncommander, and frightened at last by the prospect that opened out\r\nbefore him, he made overtures to O'Neill for a reconciliation. O'Neill\r\nagreed to lend his aid against Cromwell. He sent a portion of his army\r\nsouth, and he himself, though ill, was already on the march when he\r\ndied at Cloughoughter (6 Nov. 1649). His death at such a time was an\r\nirreparable loss both to the Catholic religion and to Ireland. Had he\r\nlived, and had Ormond and his faction co-operated with him, the\r\ncampaign of Cromwell might have had a very different termination.\r\nDuring the closing months of 1649 the situation in Ireland seemed\r\nhopeless. Though as an unscrupulous diplomatist Ormond had few equals,\r\nhe was utterly worthless as a soldier, and to make matters worse he\r\nwas still distrusted by the great mass of the Irish people. In the\r\nhope of restoring unity and of encouraging the people to continue the\r\nstruggle a synod of the bishops and clergy assembled at Clonmacnoise\r\n(Dec. 1649). They issued a declaration warning the people that they\r\ncould expect no mercy from the English Parliament, that the wholesale\r\nextirpation of Catholicism was intended, as was evidenced by the\r\nactions of Cromwell, and that the lands of the Irish Catholics were to\r\nbe handed over to English adventurers. They called upon them to forget\r\npast differences, to sink racial and personal jealousies, and to unite\r\nagainst the common enemy.[62] But the country distrusted Ormond, and\r\nrefused to rally to his standard. Another meeting consisting of the\r\nbishops and of the Commissioners of Trust was held at Loughrea, in\r\nwhich it was agreed that there should be a general levy of all men fit\r\nto bear arms, and the monastery of Kilbegan was fixed as the place of\r\nrendezvous. Several of the cities and leading men refused, however, to\r\ntake any part in a movement controlled by Ormond, and as a last\r\ndesperate resort, at the meeting of the bishops held at Jamestown (12\r\nAug. 1650) the bishops declared that there could be no hope of unity\r\nunless Ormond surrendered his trust to some person in whom the entire\r\ncountry had confidence.[63] Very reluctantly Ormond agreed to this\r\nrequest and left Ireland in December, having appointed the Earl of\r\nClanrickard as his successor. The latter was a Catholic who had played\r\na very ignoble part throughout the war. Had he displayed years before\r\nbut half the energy he displayed in its later stages things might\r\nnever have come to such a pass.\r\n\r\nAs it was, Cromwell made great progress in the South, though he was\r\nforced to raise the siege of Waterford, and suffered a bad defeat at\r\nClonmel from the nephew of O'Neill. He left Ireland in May 1650, and\r\nentrusted the command to Ireton. Owing to the state of disunion Ireton\r\nwas enabled to take city after city. Limerick was taken in 1651, and\r\nTerence O'Brien, Bishop of Emly, was put to death. Bishop MacMahon of\r\nClogher, who had assumed the leadership of the army of Owen Row\r\nO'Neill after the latter's death was defeated at Scarrifhollis (1650).\r\nLater on he was captured, and put to death, his head being impaled on\r\nthe gates of Enniskillen as a warning to his co-religionists. The\r\nsubmission of Clanrickard in 1652 practically put an end to the war,\r\nand before another year had elapsed all effective resistance had\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nDuring the Kilkenny Confederation the Catholic Church was restored to\r\nits original position. In the districts controlled by the Confederates\r\nthe bishops and clergy were allowed to occupy once more their houses\r\nand churches wherever these had not been destroyed, and religious\r\ncommunities of both men and women were set up again close to their\r\nformer monasteries and convents, though at the same time the Catholic\r\nLords of the Pale were alert lest they should be asked to return any\r\nof the ecclesiastical or monastic lands that had been granted to them\r\nby royal patent. In Dublin and wherever Ormond and the Royalists had\r\nauthority, both clergy and people enjoyed complete toleration, but in\r\ncertain portions of the North, and wherever the Puritans and\r\nParliamentarians held sway, persecution was still the order of the\r\nday. When Dublin was surrendered to the Parliamentarians (1647) the\r\npriests, and later on, all Catholics, were expelled from the city. In\r\nthe South of Ireland Lord Inchiquin acted in the most savage manner in\r\nCashel and generally in the cities which he conquered, while the\r\nParliamentarian party in the North showed no mercy to the Catholics\r\nwho fell into their hands. After the arrival of Cromwell the prospect\r\nbecame even more gloomy. Though he announced that he would interfere\r\nwith no man's religion, he declared that on no account could he\r\ntolerate the celebration of Mass.[64] The clergy were put to the sword\r\nin Drogheda and Wexford. The Archbishop of Tuam was killed during the\r\nwar (1645); Boetius Egan, Bishop of Ross, fell into the hands of Lord\r\nBroghill and was put to a cruel death because, instead of advising the\r\ngarrison of Carrigdrohid to surrender, he encouraged them to continue\r\nthe struggle (1650); Terence Albert O'Brien, Bishop of Emly, was\r\ncaptured by Ireton after the siege of Limerick, and was hanged; Heber\r\nMacMahon, Bishop of Clogher, was put to death by the orders of Coote\r\n(1650); Bishop Rothe of Ossory died as a result of the sufferings he\r\nendured, and Bishop French of Ferns, after undergoing terrible trials\r\nin Ireland, was obliged to make his escape to the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn arranging the terms of surrender the Cromwellian generals sometimes\r\nexcluded the bishops and clergy from protection, and at best they\r\ngranted them only a short time to prepare for leaving the country. The\r\npresence of the priests was regarded as a danger for the projected\r\nsettlement of Ireland, and hence the order was given (1650) that they\r\nshould be arrested. In 1650 a reward of £20 was offered to any one who\r\nwould betray the hiding place of any Jesuits, priests, friars, monks,\r\nor nuns. At first those clergy who were captured were sent into France\r\nand Spain, but later on large numbers of them were shipped to the\r\nBarbadoes. Thus, for example, in 1655 an instruction was sent to Sir\r\nCharles Coote that the priests and friars then captive in Galway who\r\nwere over forty years of age should be banished to Portugal or France,\r\nwhile those under that age were to \"be shipped away for the Barbadoes\r\nor other American plantations.\" For those who returned death was the\r\npenalty that was laid down. Since the priests still contrived to elude\r\ntheir pursuers by disguising themselves as labourers, peasants,\r\nbeggars, gardeners, etc., an order was issued in 1655 that a general\r\nsearch should be made throughout Ireland for the capture of all\r\npriests. Five pounds was to be paid to any one who would arrest a\r\npriest, and more might be awarded if the individual taken were of\r\nspecial importance. When the jails were well filled, another\r\ninstruction was issued that the priests should be brought together at\r\nCarrickfergus for transportation. Here it was claimed that some\r\noffered to submit to the terms of the government rather than allow\r\nthemselves to be sent away, but as the statement comes from an\r\nunreliable source it should be received with caution. In 1657 Major\r\nMorgan, representative of Wicklow in the United Parliament of England\r\nand Ireland, declared: \"We have three beasts to destroy that lay heavy\r\nburthens upon us. The first is the wolf, on whom we lay five pounds a\r\nhead of a dog, and ten pounds if a bitch. The second beast is a\r\npriest, on whose head we lay ten pounds, and if he be eminent, more.\r\nThe third beast is a Tory, on whose head, if he be a public Tory we\r\nlay twenty pounds, and forty shillings on a private Tory.\" Towards the\r\nend of the Protectorate the government, instead of transporting the\r\npriests abroad, sent them in crowds to the Island of Aran and to\r\nInnisbofin. \"The Lord Deputy and Council,\" wrote Colonel Thomas\r\nHerbert (1658), \"did in July last give order for payment of £100 upon\r\naccount to Colonel Sadleir, to be issued as he should conceive fit for\r\nmaintenance of such Popish priests as are or should be confined to the\r\nIsle of Boffin, according to six-pence daily allowing, building cabins\r\nand the like. It is not doubted but care was taken accordingly, and\r\nfor that the judges in their respective circuits may probably find\r\ncause for sending much more priests to that island, I am commanded to\r\nsignify thus much unto you that you may not be wanting to take such\r\ncare in this business as according to former directions and provision\r\nis made.\"[65]\r\n\r\nAlready in 1642 the English Parliament had passed measures for the\r\nwholesale confiscation of Catholic Ireland, and had pledged the land\r\nto these \"adventurers\" who subscribed money to carry on the war. In\r\n1652, when the reduction of Ireland was practically complete, it was\r\ndeemed prudent to undertake the work of clearing Leinster and Munster\r\nof its old owners to prepare the way for the adventurers and for the\r\nsoldiers, whose arrears were paid by grants of farms or estates.\r\nAccording to the terms of the Act and of the Instructions issued in\r\nconnexion with it all Irish Catholics were commanded to transplant\r\nthemselves to Connaught before the 1st May 1654 under pain of being\r\nput to death by court-martial if they were found after that date east\r\nof the Shannon. Exceptions were indeed made in the case of those women\r\nwho were married to English Protestants before December 1650, provided\r\nthat they themselves had become Protestant; in case of boys under\r\nfourteen and girls under twelve in Protestant service and who would be\r\nbrought up Protestants, and lastly in case of those who could prove\r\nthat for the previous ten years they had maintained \"a constant good\r\naffection\" towards the Parliament. The order to transplant was\r\nnotified throughout Ireland, and a commission was set up at Loughrea\r\nto consider claims and to make assignments of land in Connaught, all\r\nof which was to be at the disposal of the Irish except a prescribed\r\nterritory along the sea-board. Even the inhabitants of Galway, who had\r\nsubmitted only on the express condition of retaining their lands, were\r\ndriven out of the city, and the city itself was handed over to the\r\ncorporations of Gloucester and Liverpool to recoup them for the losses\r\nthey had suffered during the Civil War. Petitions began to pour in for\r\nmercy or at least for an extension to the time-limit, but though on\r\nthe latter point some concessions were made, few individuals were\r\nallowed any reprieve. The landowners were marked men, and they were\r\nobliged to go. It would be impossible to describe the hardship and\r\nmiseries suffered by those who were forced to leave their own homes,\r\nand to seek a refuge in what was to them a strange country. To ease\r\nthe situation large numbers of the men capable of bearing arms were\r\nshipped to Spain, or to others of the Continental countries, but soon\r\nit was thought that this was bad policy likely only to serve some of\r\nEngland's rivals. It was then determined to transport large numbers to\r\nthe West Indies, the Barbadoes, Jamaica, and the Caribee Islands.\r\nShip-loads of boys and girls were seized according to orders from\r\nEngland, and were sent out of the country under the most awful\r\nconditions to a land where a fate awaited many of them that was worse\r\nthan death.[66] The magistrates had no scruple in committing all\r\nCatholics who remained east of the Shannon and who were brought before\r\nthem, as vagrants, and then they were hurried off to the coast.\r\n\r\nAt first the idea was to remove the native population entirely from\r\nLeinster and Munster lest the soldiers and \"adventurers\" might be\r\ncontaminated, and stern measures were taken to prevent any of the\r\nofficers or men from taking Irish wives. Ireton laid it down that any\r\nofficer or soldier who dared to marry an Irish girl until she had been\r\nexamined by a competent board to see whether her conversion flowed\r\n\"from a real work of God upon her heart,\" should be punished\r\nseverely.[67] But later on petitions poured in from the new Protestant\r\nlandowners to be allowed to keep Catholics as servants and labourers,\r\nand on the understanding that the masters would utilise this\r\nopportunity to spread the true religion, their requests were granted.\r\nSome obtained dispensations or at least managed to secure delays;\r\nothers probably were able to come to terms with the soldiers to whom\r\ntheir farms had fallen in the general lottery, and others still\r\npreferred to risk the danger of transportation by remaining in their\r\nown district rather than to seek a new home. Had the Protectorate\r\nlasted long enough the policy of transplanting might have succeeded,\r\nbut as it was the Cromwellian planters soon disappeared or became\r\nmerged into the native population, and in spite of all the bloodshed\r\nand robbery, the people of Ireland generally were as devoted to the\r\nCatholic religion in 1659 as they had been ten years before.[68]\r\n\r\nWhen it became clear from the course of events in England that Charles\r\nII. was about to be restored to the throne Lord Broghill and Sir\r\nCharles Coote, both of whom had helped to crush the Irish Royalists\r\nand had profited largely by the Revolution, hastened to show their\r\nzeal for the king's cause. The Catholics who had fought so loyally for\r\nhis father hoped that at last justice would be done to them by\r\nre-instating them in the lands from which they had been driven by the\r\nenemies of the king. But Charles was determined to take no risks. He\r\nsent over the Duke of Ormond, the most dangerous enemy of the Catholic\r\nreligion in Ireland, as Lord Lieutenant (1660). A Parliament was\r\ncalled in 1661, and as the Catholics had been driven from the\r\ncorporate towns during the Cromwellian régime and as the Cromwellian\r\nplanters were still in possession, the House of Commons was to all\r\nintents and purposes Protestant. An Act of Settlement was passed\r\nwhereby Catholics who could prove their \"innocence\" of the rebellion\r\nwere to be restored, but the definition of innocence in the case was\r\nso complicated that it was hoped few Catholics, if any, would succeed\r\nin establishing their claims (1661). A Court of Claims composed of\r\nfive Protestant Commissioners, was set up to examine the individual\r\ncases, but in a short time, when it was discovered that a large number\r\nof Catholics were succeeding in satisfying the conditions laid down by\r\nlaw for restoration to their property, an outcry was raised by the\r\nplanters, and the Court of Claims was suspended (1664). The Act of\r\nExplanation was then passed to simplify the proceedings, as a result\r\nof which act two-thirds of the land of Ireland was left in the hands\r\nof the Protestant settlers. Close on sixty of the Catholic nobility\r\nwere restored as a special favour by the king, but a large body of\r\nthose who had been driven out by Cromwell were left without any\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the Cromwellian persecution nearly all the bishops\r\nand a large body of the clergy, both secular and regular, had been\r\ndriven from Ireland, but after the accession of Charles, who was known\r\nto be personally friendly to the Catholics, many of them began to\r\nreturn. It would be a mistake, however, to imagine that the\r\npersecution had ceased, or that the laws against the clergy were not\r\nput in force in several districts. Ormond returned to Ireland as\r\nhostile to Catholicity as he had been before he was driven into exile;\r\nand as he thought that he had a particular grievance against the Irish\r\nbishops he was determined to stir up the clergy against them, to\r\ndivide the Catholics into warring factions, and by favouring one side\r\nto create a royalist Catholic party as distinct from the ultramontane\r\nor papal party. For this work he had at hand a useful instrument in\r\nthe person of Father Peter Walsh, a Franciscan friar, who had\r\ndistinguished himself as a bitter opponent of the nuncio and as a\r\nleader of the Ormondist faction in the Supreme Council. In 1661 it was\r\ndetermined by some leading members, both lay and clerical, to present\r\nan address of welcome to Charles II., but by the influence of Walsh\r\nand others the address, instead of being a mere protestation of\r\nloyalty, was framed on the model of the Oath of Allegiance (1605),\r\nwhich had been condemned more than once by the Pope. Many of the\r\nCatholic lords indicated their agreement with this address or\r\nRemonstrance, as it was called, and some of the clergy, deceived by\r\nthe counsels of Father Walsh, expressed their willingness to adhere to\r\nits terms. Ormond, who spent money freely in subsidising Walsh and his\r\nsupporters,[69] had good reason to be delighted with the success of\r\nhis schemes. Grave disputes broke out among the clergy, which the\r\ngovernment took care to foment by patronising the Remonstrants and by\r\nwreaking its vengeance on the anti-Remonstrants on the grounds of\r\ntheir alleged disloyalty. To bring matters to a crisis it was arranged\r\nby Walsh and Ormond that a meeting of the bishops, vicars, and heads\r\nof religious orders should be held in Dublin (June 1666). In addition\r\nto Dr. O'Reilly, Archbishop of Armagh, Bishops Plunkett of Ardagh, and\r\nLynch of Kilfenora, there were present a number of vicars of vacant\r\ndioceses together with representatives of the Franciscans, Dominicans,\r\nAugustinians, Capuchins, and Jesuits.[70] Dr. O'Reilly spoke strongly\r\nagainst the terms of the Remonstrance as being highly disrespectful to\r\nthe Pope, and the majority of those present supported his contention.\r\nThey expressed their willingness to present an address of loyalty from\r\nwhich the objectionable clauses should be omitted. But Walsh,\r\ndissatisfied with anything but a complete submission, shifted the\r\nground of the debate, by endeavouring to secure the acceptance of the\r\nassembly of the pro-Gallican declaration of the Sorbonne (1663). Even\r\nstill his efforts were far from being successful, and the meeting was\r\ndissolved by Ormond. The primate was kept a prisoner in Dublin for\r\nsome months, and then transported to the Continent, while the other\r\nmembers present were obliged to make their escape from Ireland or to\r\ngo into hiding. By orders of Ormond close watch was kept upon the\r\nclergy who sided against the Remonstrance, and many of them were\r\nthrown into prison.[71]\r\n\r\nIn 1669 Ormond was recalled, and after a short time Lord Berkeley was\r\nsent over as Lord Lieutenant. Though he was instructed to \"execute the\r\nlaws against the titular archbishops, bishops, and vicar-generals,\r\nthat have threatened or excommunicated the Remonstrants,\"[72] yet, as\r\nthe personal friend of the Duke of York, and as one who knew\r\nintimately the king's own views, he acted in as tolerant a manner\r\ntowards Catholics as it was possible for him to do considering the\r\nstate of mind of the officials and of the Protestant bishops and\r\nclergy. From 1670 till the arrival of Ormond once more in 1677, though\r\nseveral proclamations were issued and though here and there individual\r\npriests were persecuted, Catholics as a body enjoyed comparative calm.\r\nThe Holy See took advantage of this to appoint to several of the\r\nvacant Sees. Amongst those appointed at this time were Oliver Plunket\r\nto Armagh (1669), Peter Talbot to Dublin, which had not been filled\r\nsince the death of Dr. Fleming in 1655, William Burgat to Cashel\r\n(1669), and James Lynch to Tuam. Dr. Plunket had accompanied Scarampi\r\nto Rome (1645), where he read a particularly brilliant course as a\r\nstudent of the Irish College, and afterwards acted as a professor in\r\nthe Propaganda till his nomination to Armagh. Dr. Talbot was born at\r\nMalahide, joined the Society of Jesus, was a close personal friend of\r\nCharles II. during the latter's exile on the Continent, and after the\r\nRestoration enjoyed a pension from the king. Shortly after his\r\nappointment an outcry was raised against him because he and his\r\nbrother, Colonel Talbot, were supposed to be urging a re-examination\r\nof the Act of Settlement, and Charles II. was weak enough to sign a\r\ndecree banishing him from the kingdom. He returned to Ireland only in\r\n1677, the year in which Ormond arrived for his last term of office as\r\nLord Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nAlready Shaftesbury's two subordinates, Titus Oates and Tonge, were\r\nconcocting the infamous story of the Popish Plot in the hope of\r\nsecuring the exclusion of the Duke of York from the throne. In this\r\nplot, according to the account of its lying authors, the Catholics of\r\nIreland were to play an important part, the Jesuits and the\r\nArchbishops of Dublin and Tuam being supposed to be particularly\r\nactive. In October 1678 a proclamation was issued ordering all\r\narchbishops, bishops, vicars, abbots, and other dignitaries of the\r\nChurch of Rome, and all others exercising jurisdiction by authority of\r\nthe Pope, together with all Jesuits and regular priests, to depart\r\nfrom the kingdom before the 20th November, and all Popish societies,\r\nconvents, seminaries, and schools were to be dissolved at once.[73]\r\nThis was followed by a number of others couched in a similar strain,\r\nand large numbers of priests were sent to the coast for\r\ntransportation. The chapels opened in Dublin and in the principal\r\ncities were closed, and the clergy who remained were obliged to have\r\nrecourse to various devices to escape their pursuers. Dr. Talbot was\r\narrested and thrown into prison (1678), where he remained till death\r\nput an end to his sufferings in November 1680. Though both the king\r\nand Ormond were convinced of his innocence, yet such was the state of\r\nProtestant frenzy at the time that they dare not move a hand to assist\r\nhim. Dr. Plunket, after eluding the vigilance of his pursuers for some\r\ntime, was arrested in 1679. He was brought to trial at Dundalk, but\r\nhis accusers feared to trust an Irish court, the case was postponed,\r\nand in the meantime his enemies arranged that he should be brought to\r\nLondon for trial. Every care was taken to obtain a verdict. The judges\r\nrefused a delay to bring over witnesses for the defence, and made no\r\nattempt to conceal their bias and their hatred for the Catholic\r\nreligion, the very profession of which was sufficient to condemn him\r\nin their eyes. He was executed at Tyburn (1681), and he was the last\r\nvictim to suffer death in England on account of the plot of Oates and\r\nhis perjured accomplices.[74] But in Ireland Ormond had no intention\r\nof dropping the persecution. Several of the bishops and vicars-general\r\nwere arrested and either held as prisoners or banished, and spies were\r\nsent through the country to track down those who defied the\r\nproclamation of banishment by remaining to watch over their dioceses.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James II. (Feb. 1685) the Catholics of Ireland had\r\nreason to hope for an improvement of their position, and this time at\r\nleast they were not disappointed. The Duke of Ormond was recalled, and\r\nthe Earl of Clarendon was sent over as Lord Lieutenant. He was\r\ninstructed to maintain the Act of Settlement, but at the same time to\r\nallow Catholics full freedom of worship, and to consider them eligible\r\nfor civil and military appointment. With him was associated as\r\nmilitary commander Colonel Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnell, brother\r\nof the late Archbishop of Dublin. In accordance with the well-known\r\nwishes of the king, Catholic officers were appointed in the army,\r\nCatholics were allowed once more to act as sheriffs, magistrates, and\r\njudges, and steps were taken to see that the corporations, which had\r\nbeen closed against Catholics for years, should be no longer safe\r\nProtestant boroughs. The Irish bishops hastened to present an address\r\nof welcome to the king, and they were assured of his Majesty's favour\r\nand protection. Religious communities of both men and women were\r\nre-opened in Dublin, and in the principal cities throughout Ireland,\r\nand synods of the clergy were held to restore order and\r\ndiscipline.[75] Irish Catholics as a body were delighted with the\r\nroyal edicts in favour of religious toleration, but the small\r\nProtestant minority in the country were alarmed at seeing Catholics\r\ntreated as equals, and particularly at the prospect of seeing the Act\r\nof Settlement upset, and their titles to their estates questioned by\r\nthe real owners whom they had despoiled twenty years before. Their\r\nfears were increased when the Earl of Clarendon, whom they regarded as\r\nin some sort their protector, was recalled (1687) to make way for the\r\nEarl of Tyrconnell as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The new Lord\r\nLieutenant was far from being perfect, nor was he always prudent in\r\nhis policy or his actions, but if his conduct towards the small body\r\nof Protestants in Ireland be compared with that of his predecessors\r\nfor more than a century, or with that of his successors, towards the\r\nIrish people, he ought to be regarded as one of the most enlightened\r\nadministrators of his age.\r\n\r\nThe revolution that broke out in England (1688), the arrival of\r\nWilliam of Orange (1688), and the flight of King James to France were\r\ncalculated to stir up strife in Ireland, though it is remarkable as\r\nshowing the fair treatment they had received that a great body of the\r\nIrish Protestant bishops were in favour of supporting James against\r\nthe usurper, and that it was necessary to have recourse to lying\r\nstories of an intended general massacre to stir up opposition to the\r\nking. Tyrconnell, who had long foreseen such a course of events, had\r\nmade wonderful preparations, considering the situation of the country\r\nand the constitution of his council. Had James II. contented himself\r\nwith inducing Louis XIV. to send arms and ammunition to Ireland and to\r\nutilise to the fullest the splendid French navy, Tyrconnell, aided by\r\nthe able Irish officers who flocked to his standard from all parts of\r\nEurope, might have bidden defiance to all invaders.\r\n\r\nBut James insisted on returning to Ireland. He landed in March 1689\r\nand proceeded to Dublin, where a national Parliament was summoned to\r\nmeet in May. As a result of allowing the majority of the people to\r\nhave some voice in the selection of the members, the House of Commons\r\nin 1689 was almost as Catholic as that of 1662 had been Protestant. In\r\nthe House of Lords the Protestants might have been in the majority had\r\nall the spiritual and temporal peers taken their seats, but as several\r\nof the bishops were absent from the country, and as many of the lay\r\nlords had either joined the party of William or were waiting to see\r\nhow events would go, few of them put in an appearance. From the\r\nbeginning it was clear that the ideals of James were not the ideals of\r\nthe Irish Parliament. He wished merely to make Ireland the stepping-\r\nstone to secure his own return to England, while the representatives\r\nof Ireland were determined to provide for the welfare and independence\r\nof their own country. They began by laying down the principle that no\r\nlaws passed in England had any binding force in Ireland unless they\r\nwere approved by the king, lords, and commons of Ireland. They next\r\naffirmed the principle of liberty of conscience for all, whether\r\nCatholic or Protestant, thereby setting an example which unfortunately\r\nwas not followed either in England or in later parliamentary\r\nassemblies in Ireland. They decreed further that for the future\r\nCatholics should not be obliged to pay tithes for the support of the\r\nProtestant ministers, but rather that both Catholics and Protestants\r\nshould contribute to the support of their respective pastors, a system\r\nwhich no impartial man could condemn as unfair. They repealed the Acts\r\nof Settlement and Explanation, and declared that those who held\r\nestates in Ireland in October 1641 should be restored to them, or if\r\nthey were dead that their heirs should enter into possession. The\r\nsoldiers and adventurers were deprived thereby of the property which\r\nthey had acquired by legalised robbery and had held for over twenty\r\nyears, but it was provided that those who had purchased lands from the\r\nCromwellian grantees should be compensated from the estates of those\r\nwho were then in rebellion against the king. In view of what had taken\r\nplace in Ulster under James I., of what the Earl of Wentworth had in\r\ncontemplation for portions of Munster and Connaught had his plants not\r\nmiscarried, and of what had been done by Cromwell in nearly all parts\r\nof Catholic Ireland, the action of the Parliament of 1689 was not\r\nmerely justifiable. It was extremely moderate. An Act of Attainder was\r\nalso passed against those persons who had either declared for William\r\nof Orange, or who had left the country lest they should be regarded as\r\ntaking sides with James II. Such men were called upon to return within\r\na certain time unless they wished to incur the penalty of being\r\nregarded as traitors and punished as such. It is not true to say that\r\nthere was any secrecy observed in regard to this act, or that\r\nknowledge of it was kept from the parties concerned till the time-\r\nlimit had expired. It was discussed publicly in the presence of the\r\nProtestant bishops and Protestant representatives, and its provisions\r\nwere well known in a short time in England and Ireland.[76]\r\n\r\nDerry and Enniskillen had declared against King James towards the end\r\nof 1688, and all efforts to capture these two cities had failed. In\r\nAugust 1689 the Duke of Schomberg arrived at Bangor with an army of\r\nabout fifteen thousand men, but little was done till the arrival of\r\nWilliam of Orange in June 1690. Had the Irish and French military\r\nadvisers had a free hand they might easily have held their own, even\r\nthough William's army was composed largely of veteran troops drawn\r\nfrom nearly every country of Europe. Had James taken their advice and\r\nplayed a waiting game, by retiring behind the Shannon so as to allow\r\ntime to have his own raw levies trained, and to hold William in\r\nIreland when his presence on the Continent against Louis XIV. was so\r\nurgently required, the situation would have been awkward for his\r\nopponent; and even when James decided to advance had he gone forward\r\nboldly, as was suggested to him, and insisted upon giving battle north\r\nof Dundalk in the narrow pass between the mountains and the sea where\r\nWilliam's cavalry would have been useless, the issue might have been\r\ndifferent. But with a leader who could not make up his mind whether to\r\ngive battle or to retreat, and who, having at last decided to fight in\r\nthe worst place he could have selected, sent away his heavy guns\r\ntowards Dublin with the intention of ordering a retirement almost when\r\nthe decisive struggle had begun, it was impossible for his followers\r\nto expect any other result but defeat. In the battle of the Boyne the\r\nbrunt of the fighting fell upon the Irish recruits, and both the Irish\r\ncavalry and infantry offered a stubborn resistance. James fled to\r\nDublin, and in a short time left Ireland (1690). The Irish and French\r\ncommanders then fell back on the line of the Shannon, according to\r\ntheir original scheme. They defended Limerick so bravely that William\r\nwas obliged to raise the siege, but the capture of Athlone (1691) and\r\nthe defeat of the Irish forces at Aughrim turned the scales in favour\r\nof William. Towards the end of August 1691 the second siege of\r\nLimerick began. Sarsfield, who was in supreme command, made a vigorous\r\ndefence, but, as it was impossible to hold out indefinitely, and as\r\nthere seemed to be no longer any hope of French assistance, he opened\r\nup negotiations with General Ginkle for a surrender of the city. As a\r\nresult of these negotiations the Treaty of Limerick was signed on the\r\n3rd October 1691.[77]\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] /Cambrensis Eversus/, iii., 53. /Arch.

The situation of\r\nthe besiegers was rendered difficult by the approach of winter, and\r\nthere was a danger that the city might be relieved at any moment by\r\nthe appearance of a French fleet in the Shannon. Hence to avoid the\r\nrisks attendant on the prolongation of the siege and to set free his\r\ntroops for service on the Continent, where their presence was required\r\nso urgently, General Ginkle was willing to make many concessions.\r\nBefore the battle of Aughrim William had offered to grant the\r\nCatholics the free exercise of their religion, half the churches in\r\nthe kingdom, and the moiety of the ecclesiastical revenues.[1] But the\r\nposition of both parties had changed considerably since then, and\r\nSarsfield and his companions could hardly expect so favourable terms.\r\nThey insisted, however, on toleration, and though the first clause of\r\nthe treaty dealing expressly with that subject was drafted badly, they\r\ncertainly expected they had secured it. In addition to the military\r\narticles the Peace of Limerick contained thirteen articles, the most\r\nimportant of which were the first, and the ninth. By these it was\r\nprovided that the Catholics should enjoy such privileges in the\r\nexercise of their religion as is consistent with the laws of Ireland,\r\nand as they did enjoy in the reign of Charles II.; that their\r\nMajesties as soon as their affairs should permit them to summon a\r\nParliament would endeavour to procure for Irish Catholics \"such\r\nfurther security in that particular as may preserve them from any\r\ndisturbance upon account of their religion;\" and that the oath to be\r\nadministered to Catholics should be the simple oath of allegiance to\r\nWilliam and Mary. \"Those who signed it [the Treaty],\" writes Lecky,\r\n\"undertook that the Catholics of Ireland should not be in a worse\r\nposition, in respect to the exercise of their religion, than they had\r\nbeen in during the reign of Charles II., and they also undertook that\r\nthe influence of the government should be promptly exerted to obtain\r\nsuch an amelioration of their condition as would secure them from the\r\npossibility of disturbance. Construed in its plain and natural sense,\r\ninterpreted as every treaty should be by men of honour, the Treaty of\r\nLimerick amounted to no less than this.\"[2] The Treaty was ratified by\r\nthe sovereigns in April 1692, and its contents were communicated to\r\nWilliam's Catholic ally, the Emperor Leopold I. (1657-1705) as a proof\r\nthat the campaign in Ireland was not a campaign directed against the\r\nCatholic religion.\r\n\r\nThe king was, therefore, pledged to carry out the agreement, and by\r\nmeans of the royal veto and the control exercised by the English privy\r\ncouncil he could have done so notwithstanding the bigoted fanaticism\r\nof the Protestant minority in Ireland. Nor can it be said that the\r\nconduct of the Irish Catholics afforded any pretext for denying them\r\nthe rights to which they were entitled. Once their military leaders\r\nand the best of their soldiers had passed into the service of France\r\nthere was little danger of a Catholic rebellion, and during the years\r\nbetween 1692 and 1760, even at times when the Jacobite forces created\r\nserious troubles in Scotland and England, the historian will search in\r\nvain for any evidence of an Irish conspiracy in favour of the exiled\r\nStuarts. The penal laws were due solely to the desire of the\r\nProtestant minority to wreak a terrible vengeance on their Catholic\r\ncountrymen, to get possession of their estates, to drive them out of\r\npublic life, by excluding them from the learned professions and from\r\nall civil and military offices, to reduce them to a condition of\r\npermanent inferiority by depriving them of all means of education at\r\nhome and abroad, to uproot their religion by banishing the bishops and\r\nclergy, both regular and secular, and in a word to reduce them to the\r\nsame position as the native population of the English plantations in\r\nthe West Indies.\r\n\r\nFor some years, however, after the overthrow of the Irish forces, it\r\nwas deemed imprudent by the king and his advisers to give the Irish\r\nProtestants a free hand. Louis XIV. was a dangerous opponent, and till\r\nthe issue of the great European contest was decided it was necessary\r\nto move with caution at home. Besides, Leopold I., William's faithful\r\nally, could not afford, even from the point of view of politics, to\r\nlook on as a disinterested spectator at a terrible persecution of his\r\nown co-religionists in Ireland. But once the fall of Namur (1695) had\r\nmade it clear that Louis XIV. was not destined to become the dictator\r\nof Europe, and above all once the Peace of Ryswick (1697) had set\r\nWilliam free from a very embarrassing alliance, the Protestant\r\nofficials in Ireland were allowed a free hand. Parliament was convoked\r\nto meet in 1692. The Earl of Sydney was sent over as Lord Lieutenant,\r\nand in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Limerick Parliament\r\nshould have confirmed the articles. But men like Dopping, the\r\nProtestant Bishop of Meath, took care to inflame passion and bigotry\r\nby declaring that no faith should be kept with heretics, and when\r\nParliament met it was in no mood to make any concessions. The few\r\nCatholic members who presented themselves were called upon to\r\nsubscribe a Declaration against Transubstantiation prescribed by the\r\nEnglish Parliament, but which had no binding force in Ireland. Having\r\nin this way excluded all Catholics from Parliament, an exclusion which\r\nlasted from 1692 till the days of the Union, the Houses passed a bill\r\nrecognising the new sovereigns, and another for encouraging foreign\r\nProtestants to settle in Ireland,[3] but they refused absolutely to\r\nconfirm the Treaty of Limerick. After Parliament had been prorogued\r\nthe privy council endeavoured to induce the Earl of Sydney to issue a\r\nproclamation ordering the bishops and clergy to depart from the\r\nkingdom, but under pretence of consulting the authorities in England\r\nhe succeeded in eluding the would-be-persecutors, who were obliged to\r\ncontent themselves with indirect methods of striking at the priests,\r\nuntil Sydney was recalled, and until Lord Capel, a man after their own\r\nheart, arrived as Lord Lieutenant in 1695.\r\n\r\nIn August of that year Parliament met once more. In his opening speech\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant struck a note likely to win the approval of his\r\naudience. \"My Lords and Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I must inform you that\r\nthe Lords Justices of England have, with great application and\r\ndispatch, considered and re-transmitted all the bills sent to them;\r\nthat some of these bills have more effectually provided for your\r\nfuture security than hath ever hitherto been done; and, in my opinion,\r\nthe want of such laws has been one of the greatest causes of your past\r\nmiseries; and it will be your fault, as well as misfortune, if you\r\nneglect to lay hold of the opportunity, now put into your hands by\r\nyour great and gracious king, of making such a lasting settlement,\r\nthat it may never more be in the power of your enemies to bring the\r\nlike calamities again upon you, or to put England to that vast expense\r\nof blood and treasure it hath so often been at for securing this\r\nkingdom to the crown of England.\"[4] The measures taken to secure the\r\nProtestant settlement will repay study. It was enacted that no parent\r\nshould send his children beyond seas for education under penalty, both\r\nfor the sender and the person sent, of being disqualified \"to sue,\r\nbring, or prosecute any action, bill, plaint, or information in course\r\nof law, or to prosecute any suit in a court of equity, or to be\r\nguardian or executor, or administrator to any person, or capable of\r\nany legacy, or deed of gift, or to bear any office within the realm.\"\r\nIn addition such persons were to be deprived of all their property,\r\nboth real and personal. Any magistrate, who suspected that a child had\r\nbeen sent away could summon the parents or guardians and question them\r\nunder oath, but failing any proof the mere absence of the child was to\r\nbe taken as sufficient evidence of guilt. Popish schoolmasters in\r\nIreland were forbidden to teach school under threat of a penalty of\r\n£20 and imprisonment for three months. But lest the Catholics might\r\nobject that they had no means of education, it was enacted that every\r\nProtestant minister should open a school in his parish, and every\r\nProtestant bishop should see that a \"public Latin free-school\" was\r\nmaintained in his diocese. Having fortified Protestantism sufficiently\r\non one flank, the members next proceeded to forbid Papists to keep\r\n\"arms, armour, or ammunition,\" empowered magistrates to search the\r\nhouses of all suspected persons, threatened severe penalties against\r\nall offenders, forbade the reception of Popish apprentices by\r\nmanufacturers of war materials, prohibited all Catholics from having\r\nin their possession a horse over the value of £5, and empowered\r\nProtestant \"discoverers\" of infringements of this measure to become\r\nowners of their Catholic neighbour's horse by tendering him five\r\npounds. Lest these laws might become a dead letter it was enacted that\r\nif any judge, mayor, magistrate, or bailiff neglected to enforce them\r\nhe should pay a fine of £50, half of which was to go to the informer,\r\nand besides, he should be declared incapable of holding such an office\r\nfor ever. To prevent any misconception it was explained that all\r\npersons, who, when called upon, refused to make the Declaration\r\nagainst Transubstantiation, should be regarded as Papists.[5]\r\n\r\nFor so far, however, the opportune moment for a formal rejection of\r\nthe Limerick Treaty had not arrived. But when Parliament met in 1697\r\nit was deemed prudent to carry out the instruction of the Bishop of\r\nMeath, that no faith should be kept with Catholics. The Articles of\r\nLimerick were confirmed with most of the important clauses omitted or\r\naltered. The first clause guaranteeing toleration was deemed unfit to\r\nbe mentioned in the bill. It is clear that in the House of Lords grave\r\ndifficulties were urged against such a wholesale neglect of the terms\r\nof the treaty, and that it was necessary to invoke the authority of\r\nthe king and of the English privy council before the measure was\r\npassed. Seven of the lay lords, and six of the Protestant bishops\r\nlodged a solemn protest against what had been done. Amongst the\r\nreasons which they assigned for their disagreement with the majority\r\nwere: \"(1) Because we think the title of the Bill doth not agree with\r\nthe body thereof, the title being, An Act for the Confirmation of\r\nArticles made at the Surrender of Limerick, whereas no one of the said\r\narticles is therein, as we conceive, fully confirmed; (2) because the\r\nsaid Articles were to be confirmed in favour of them, to whom they\r\nwere granted, but the confirmation of them by the Bill is such, that\r\nit puts them in a worse condition than they were before, as we\r\nconceive; . . . (4) because several words are inserted in the bill,\r\nwhich are not in the Articles, and others omitted, which alter both\r\nthe sense and meaning, as we conceive.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe way was now clear for beginning the attack upon the clergy. An Act\r\nwas passed ordering \"all Popish archbishops, bishops, vicars-general,\r\ndeans, Jesuits, monks, friars, and all other regular Popish clergy,\r\nand all Papists exercising any ecclesiastical jurisdiction\" to depart\r\nfrom the kingdom before the 1st May 1698, under threat for those who\r\nremained beyond the specified time, of being arrested and kept in\r\nprison till they could be transported beyond the seas. They were\r\ncommanded to assemble before the 1st May at the ports of Dublin, Cork,\r\nKinsale, Youghal, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, or Carrickfergus,\r\nregister themselves at the office of the mayor, and await till\r\nprovision could be made for transporting them. All such ecclesiastics\r\nwere forbidden to come into the kingdom after the 29th December 1697,\r\nunder pain of imprisonment for twelve months, and if any such person\r\nventured to return after having been transported he should be adjudged\r\nguilty of high treason. If any person knowingly harboured, relieved,\r\nconcealed, or entertained any popish ecclesiastic after the dates\r\nmentioned he was to forfeit £20 for the first offence, £40 for the\r\nsecond, and all his lands and property for the third offence, half to\r\ngo (if not exceeding £100) to the informer. Justices of the peace were\r\nempowered to summon all persons charged upon oath with having aided or\r\nreceived ecclesiastics and to levy these fines, or to commit the\r\naccused person to the county jail till the fines should be paid. All\r\npersons whatsoever were forbidden after the 29th December 1697, to\r\nbury any deceased person \"in any suppressed monastery, abbey, or\r\nconvent, that is not made use of for celebrating divine service,\r\naccording to the liturgy of the Church of Ireland as by law\r\nestablished, or within the precincts thereof, under pain of forfeiting\r\nthe sum of ten pounds,\" which sum might be recovered off any person\r\nattending a burial in such circumstances. Justices of the peace were\r\nempowered to issue warrants for the arrest of ecclesiastics who came\r\ninto Ireland, or remained there in defiance of these statutes, and\r\nwere commanded to give an account of their work in this respect at the\r\nnext quarter sessions held in their counties. Finally, it was provided\r\nthat any justice of the peace or mayor who neglected to enforce this\r\nlaw should pay a fine for every such offence of £100, half of which\r\nwas to be paid to the informer, and should be disqualified for serving\r\nas a justice of the peace. An Act was also passed \"to prevent\r\nProtestants intermarrying with Papists.\" If any Protestant woman, heir\r\nto real estate or to personal estate value £500 or upwards, married a\r\nhusband without having first got \"a certificate in writing under the\r\nhand of the minister of the parish, bishop of the diocese, and some\r\njustice of the peace,\" and attested by two witnesses that her intended\r\nhusband was a Protestant, the estates or property devolved immediately\r\non the next of kin if a Protestant; and if any man married without\r\nhaving got a similar certificate that the lady of his choice was a\r\nProtestant he became thereby disqualified to act as a guardian or\r\nexecutor, to sit in the House of Commons, or to hold any civil or\r\nmilitary office, unless he could prove that within one year he had\r\nconverted his wife to the Protestant religion. Any clergyman assisting\r\nat such marriages was liable to a penalty of £20, half of which was to\r\nbe paid to the informer.[7]\r\n\r\nIn order to secure that none of the bishops or regular clergy should\r\nescape, the revenue officers in the different districts were\r\ninstructed to make a return of the names and abodes of all priests on\r\nthe 27th July 1697. According to the digest compiled from these\r\nreturns there were then in Ireland eight hundred and ninety-two\r\nsecular priests and four hundred and ninety-five regulars. The houses\r\nof the regular clergy were broken up; their property was disposed of\r\nor handed over in trust to some reliable neighbour, and the priests\r\nprepared to go into exile. During the year 1698 four hundred and\r\nforty-four of them were shipped from various Irish ports, several\r\nothers were arrested and thrown into prison, and a few escaped by\r\npassing as secular priests. Many of the unfortunate exiles made their\r\nway to Paris, where they were dependent upon the charity of the French\r\npeople and of the Pope. Similar vigorous action was taken to secure\r\nthe banishment of the bishops and vicars, in the hope that if these\r\ncould be driven from the country the whole machinery of the Catholic\r\nChurch in Ireland would become so disorganised that its total\r\ndisappearance in a short time might be expected. Several of the\r\nbishops had been declared traitors for having supported the cause of\r\nJames I., and had been obliged to flee to the Continent. Two others\r\nwere shipped in accordance with the law of 1697; three were discovered\r\nby the revenue officials, of whom the Bishop of Clonfert was arrested,\r\nrescued, and died; the Bishop of Waterford made his escape after a few\r\nyears of hiding, and the Bishop of Cork was arrested and transported\r\n(1703). So that there remained in Ireland only the Archbishop of\r\nCashel and the Bishop of Dromore. News of what was taking place in\r\nIreland was conveyed to the Emperor, who instructed his ambassador to\r\nlodge a strong protest, but the ambassador was put off with empty\r\npromises or with a bold denial of the truth of his information. Nor\r\nwere these acts allowed to remain a dead letter. The revenue\r\nofficials, the magistrates, sheriffs, judges, Protestant bishops, and\r\nProtestant ministers joined in the hunt for regulars, bishops, vicars,\r\ndeans, etc., and generous rewards were offered to all informers.[8]\r\n\r\nThe accession of Queen Anne (1702-14) led only to a still more violent\r\npersecution. Parliament met in September 1703, and proceeded almost\r\nimmediately to attack both priests and lay Catholics. Most of the\r\nbishops were dead or had been driven from the country. The regulars,\r\nit was thought, could not survive. It was determined, therefore, to\r\nattack the remaining secular clergy in two ways, first by enforcing\r\nstrictly the laws against Catholic education in Ireland, and by making\r\nmore severe the laws against going to colleges abroad,[9] as well as\r\nby enacting that any priest who entered Ireland after 1st January 1704\r\nshould be punished in accordance with the terms of the law laid down\r\npreviously against bishops and regulars,[10] so that by these means\r\nthe supply of clergy might be cut off; and second, by obliging all the\r\npriests in Ireland to register themselves so that the government could\r\nlay hold of them whenever it wished to do so. According to this latter\r\nmeasure all priests were commanded to give an account to the clerks of\r\nthe peace of their district, of their place of abode, their parishes,\r\ntogether with the time and place of their ordination, and were to\r\nprovide two securities of £50 for their future good behaviour; those\r\nwho neglected to make this return were to be imprisoned and\r\ntransported; and it was provided later on that no parish priest could\r\nhave an assistant or curate.[11] To crush the Catholic laymen it was\r\nenacted that in case the eldest son became a Protestant his father\r\ncould not sell, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of the family property;\r\nthat no Catholic could act as guardian to orphans or minors, but that\r\nthese should be handed over to the custody of some Protestant who was\r\nrequired to bring them up in the Protestant religion; that no Catholic\r\ncould purchase any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, or any profits\r\nor rents from such possessions, or acquire leases for a term exceeding\r\nthirty-one years or inherit as nearest of kin to any Protestant; the\r\nestates of a Catholic landowner dying without a Protestant heir were\r\nto be divided equally among his sons; no person could hold any office,\r\ncivil or military, without subscribing to the Declaration against\r\nTransubstantiation, and the oath of abjuration, and receiving the\r\nsacrament; no Catholics, unless under very exceptional circumstances,\r\ncould be allowed to live in Galway and Limerick, and no person could\r\nvote at any election without taking the oaths of allegiance and\r\nabjuration. Sir Theobald Butler appeared at the bar of the House of\r\nCommons to plead against these measures, and to point out that as no\r\nlaws of the king were in force in the days of Charles II. the proposed\r\nbill was in direct opposition to the terms of the Treaty of\r\nLimerick,[12] but his protest produced no effect in England or in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe whole army of government officials, Protestant ministers, and\r\nspies were set to work to discover what persons had left Ireland to go\r\nabroad for education, to seize all priests found entering the country,\r\nand to take measures against those in the country who neglected to\r\nregister themselves as they had been commanded to do. One hundred and\r\neighty-nine priests were registered in Ulster, three hundred and\r\nfifty-two in Leinster, two hundred and eighty-nine in Munster, and two\r\nhundred and fifty-nine in Connaught.[13] Against the laity, too, the\r\nfull penalties of the law were enforced, but yet it is satisfactory to\r\nnote that in the year 1703 only four certificates of conformity were\r\nfiled, sixteen in 1704, three in 1705, five in 1706, two in 1707, and\r\nseven in 1708.[14] It was clear, therefore, that if the Catholic\r\nreligion was to be suppressed recourse must be had to even more\r\nextreme measures. In 1709 an act was passed ordering all priests to\r\ntake the Oath of Abjuration before the 25th March 1710, unless they\r\nwished to incur all the pains and penalties levelled against the\r\nregular clergy.[15] By the Oath of Abjuration they were supposed to\r\ndeclare that the Pretender \"hath not any right or title whatsoever to\r\nthe crown of this realm or any other the dominions thereunto\r\nbelonging,\" that they would uphold the Protestant succession, and that\r\nthey made this declaration \"heartily, willingly, and truly.\" Rewards\r\nwere laid down for the encouragement of informers, £50 being allowed\r\nfor discovering an archbishop, bishop, vicar, or any person exercising\r\nforeign jurisdiction, £20 for the discovery of a regular or a non-\r\nregistered secular priest, and £10 for the discovery of a Popish\r\nschoolmaster. To facilitate the arrest of the clergy it was provided\r\nthat any two justices of the peace might summon Catholics before them\r\nand interrogate them under oath when and where they heard Mass last,\r\nwhat priest officiated, and who were present at the ceremony. Failure\r\nto give the required information about Mass, priests, or school-\r\nmasters was to be punished by imprisonment for twelve months or until\r\nthe guilty person paid a fine of £20. A pension of £20 a year,\r\nincreased afterwards to £40, was provided for those priests who left\r\nthe Catholic Church.[16] As regards lay Catholics further measures\r\nwere taken to encourage the children of Catholic parents to become\r\nProtestant by ordaining that in such a case the Court of Chancery\r\ncould interfere and dictate to the father what provision he must make\r\nfor such children. Similarly wives of Catholics were encouraged to\r\nsubmit by the promise that the Court of Chancery would interfere to\r\nsafeguard their interests. Stringent regulations were made to ensure\r\nthat all pretended converts engaged in the professions and in public\r\noffices should rear their children in the Protestant faith, and to\r\nensure that no Catholic could teach school publicly or privately or\r\neven act as usher in a Protestant school.\r\n\r\nThe priests, though not unwilling to take a simple oath of allegiance,\r\nrefused as a body to take the Oath of Abjuration, and immediately they\r\nbecame liable to all the punishments directed against the bishops and\r\nregulars. Wholesale arrests took place over the country; spies were\r\nemployed to track them down; the men who had gone security for their\r\ngood behaviour in 1704 were commanded to bring them in under threat of\r\nhaving the recognisances estreated; judges were ordered to make\r\ninquiries at the assizes; and Catholics were called upon to discover\r\non their clergy by giving information about the priests who celebrated\r\nMass. The search was carried on even more vigorously in Munster and\r\nConnaught than in Ulster and Leinster, so that during the remainder of\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne no priest in any part of Ireland could\r\nofficiate publicly with safety.[17] Petitions were drawn up and\r\nforwarded to all the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, asking them to\r\nintercede for their co-religionists in Ireland, but though many of\r\nthem did instruct their representatives in London to take action,\r\ntheir appeals and remonstrances produced very little effect.[18] At\r\nthe same time the laws in regard to Catholic property, and Catholic\r\neducation were enforced with great severity, particular care being\r\ntaken that only Protestants should be recognised as guardians of\r\nCatholic minors or orphans, and that the guardians should rear the\r\nchildren as Protestants. Against the law, the wishes or even the last\r\ntestament of a dying father were of no avail.[19]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of George I. (1714-27) there was very little\r\nimprovement in the condition of the Catholics of Ireland. Indeed, in\r\nregard to legal enactments their condition was rendered much worse.\r\nThey were obliged to pay double the contribution of their Protestant\r\nneighbours for the support of the militia; their horses could be\r\nseized for the use of the militia; they were prevented from acting as\r\npetty constables or from having any voice in determining the amount to\r\nbe levied off them for the building and repairing of Protestant\r\nchurches or for the maintenance of Protestant worship. In 1719 a new\r\nand more violent measure was passed by the House of Commons, according\r\nto one of the clauses of which all unregistered priests caught in\r\nIreland were to be branded with a red-hot iron upon the cheek. The\r\nIrish privy council changed this penalty into mutilation, but when the\r\nbill was sent to England for approval the original clause was\r\nrestored. For purely technical reasons the bill never became law.[20]\r\nIn 1742 another bill was introduced and passed by both Houses in\r\nDublin by which all unregistered priests who did not depart out of\r\nIreland before March 1724 were to be punished as guilty of high\r\ntreason unless they consented to take the Oath of Abjuration; a\r\nsimilar punishment was decreed against bishops, vicars, deans, and\r\nmonks without allowing them any alternative; all persons adjudged\r\nguilty of receiving or affording assistance to priests were to be put\r\nto death as felons \"without benefit of clergy;\" Popish schoolmasters\r\nand tutors were to undergo a like punishment, and to ensure that the\r\nlaw would be enforced ample rewards were given to all informers. But\r\nwhen the bill was sent to England it failed to receive the sanction of\r\nthe king and privy council, and was therefore allowed to lapse.[21]\r\n\r\nThe results of these laws made to secure the extirpation of the\r\nCatholic religion were to be seen in 1731 when a systematic inquiry\r\nwas conducted by the Protestant ministers and bishops into the\r\ncondition of the Catholics in every single parish in Ireland. In\r\nArmagh there were only twenty-five \"Mass-houses,\" some of them being\r\nmere cabins; in Meath there were one hundred and eight; in Clogher\r\nonly nine although in addition it was reported that there were forty-\r\nsix altars where the people heard Mass in the open air; in Raphoe one\r\n\"old Mass-house,\" one recently erected, \"one cabin, and two sheds;\" in\r\nDerry there were nine Mass-houses, all \"mean, inconsiderable\r\nbuildings,\" but Mass was said in most parts of the diocese in open\r\nfields, or under some shed set up occasionally for shelter; in Dromore\r\nthere were two Mass-houses, and \"two old forts were Masses are\r\nconstantly said;\" and in Down there were five Mass-houses, but in\r\naddition the priests celebrated \"in private houses or on the\r\nmountains.\" In the diocese of Dublin it was reported that the number\r\nof Mass-houses amounted to fifty-eight, sixteen of which were situated\r\nwithin the city; in Ferns there were thirty-one together with eleven\r\n\"moveable altars in the fields;\" in Leighlin, twenty-eight, besides\r\nthree altars in the fields and three private chapels, and in Ossory\r\ntheir were thirty-two \"old Mass-houses\" and eighteen built since the\r\nreign of George I. In Cashel there were forty \"Mass-houses,\" and it\r\nwas noted particularly that one was being built at Tipperary, \"in the\r\nform of a cross, ninety-two feet by seventy-two;\" in Cloyne there were\r\nseventy Mass-houses. In Tuam the Protestant archbishop reported that\r\nthere were Mass-houses in most parishes; in Elphin it was reckoned\r\nthat there were forty-seven \"Mass-houses,\" a few of them being huts;\r\nin Killala there were four, in Achonry thirteen, in Clonfert forty,\r\nand in Kilmacduagh there were thirteen. But in a remarkable fact that\r\nin spite of all the legal penalties directed against the priests, and\r\nof all the work that was being done by the government officials, the\r\n\"priest-catchers,\" whose profession according to the Irish House of\r\nCommons was an honourable one, and by the magistrates, and ministers,\r\nthere was a very large number of secular priests still ministering to\r\nthe people and also of friars, who were reported as being active in\r\npreaching to the people sometimes in private houses and sometimes in\r\nthe open fields. And it is even still more remarkable that despite the\r\nvigilance of the Protestant bishops there were even then over five\r\nhundred \"popish schools\" in some of which the classics were taught,\r\nand there were besides several schoolmasters who moved from place to\r\nplace. The Protestant Bishop of Derry announced with a considerable\r\namount of pride that there were not any popish schools in his diocese.\r\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"a straggling schoolmaster sets up in some of\r\nthe mountainous parts of some parishes, but upon being threatened, as\r\nthey constantly are, with a warrant, or a presentment by the church-\r\nwardens, they generally think proper to withdraw.\"[22]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of George II. (1727-60) the persecution began to\r\nabate, though more than one new measure was added to the penal laws.\r\nPrimate Boulter, who was practically speaking ruler of the country\r\nduring his term of office, was alarmed at the large number of Papists\r\nstill in the country--five to one was his estimate--and at the\r\npresence of close on three thousand priests, and suggested new schemes\r\nfor the overthrow of Popery. The Catholics were deprived of their\r\nvotes at parliamentary or municipal elections lest Protestant members\r\nmight be inclined to curry favour with them by opposing the penal\r\ncode; barristers, clerks, attornies, solicitors, etc., were not to be\r\nadmitted to practice unless they had taken the oaths and declarations\r\nwhich no Catholic could take; converts to Protestantism were to be\r\ntreated similarly unless they could produce reliable evidence that\r\nthey had lived as Protestants for two years, and that they were\r\nrearing their children as Protestants. Very severe laws had been laid\r\ndown already against marriages between Catholics and Protestants, but\r\nas such marriages still took place, it was declared that the priest\r\nwho celebrated such marriages was to be reputed guilty of felony, that\r\nafter the 1st May 1746 all marriages between Catholics and persons who\r\nhad been Protestants within the twelve months preceding the marriage,\r\nshould be null and void, as should also all marriages between\r\nProtestants if celebrated in the presence of a priest. Later on the\r\ndeath penalty was decreed against priests who assisted at such\r\nunions.[23] Finally, through the exertions of Primate Boulter and\r\nBishop Marsh, the Charter Schools were established. They were\r\nintended, as was explained in the prospectus, \"to rescue the souls of\r\nthousands of poor children from the dangers of Popish superstition and\r\nidolatry, and their bodies from the miseries of idleness and beggary.\"\r\nThe schools were entirely Protestant in management, and the children\r\nwere reared as Protestants. Once a Catholic parent surrendered his\r\nchildren he could never claim them again. In 1745 the Irish Parliament\r\nappropriated the fees derived from the licences required by all\r\nhawkers and pedlars to the support of the Charter Schools, and it is\r\ncomputed that between the years 1745 and 1767 these same institutions\r\nreceived about £112,000 from the public funds.[24] Though emancipation\r\nwas still a long way off, yet after 1760 it began to be recognised\r\nthat the penal code had failed to achieve the object for which it had\r\nbeen designed.\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[1] Lecky, op. cit., i., 140.\r\n\r\n[2] Lecky, op. cit., i., 140.\r\n\r\n[3] /Irish Statutes/, iii., 241 sqq.\r\n\r\n[4] /The Journals of the House of Commons/ (Ireland) ii., 44-5.\r\n\r\n[5] /Irish Statutes/, ii., 249-67.\r\n\r\n[6] /Journals of the House of Lords/ (Ireland), i., 635-6.\r\n\r\n[7] /Irish Statutes/, ii., 339 sqq.\r\n\r\n[8] Cf.
