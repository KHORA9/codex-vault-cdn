And yet, even worse than this\r\nlanguorous inanition is the active policy of those who despise\r\neverything contemporary or native, and substitute sciolism for\r\ncatholicity, contempt for analysis.\r\n\r\nWhile the greater part of the world has stayed aloof, the problem of a\r\nnational American music has been solving itself. Aside from\r\noccasional attentions evoked by chance performances, it may be said in\r\ngeneral that the growth of our music has been unloved and unheeded by\r\nanybody except a few plodding composers, their wives, and a retainer\r\nor two. The only thing that inclines me to invade the privacy of the\r\nAmerican composer and publish his secrets, is my hearty belief, lo,\r\nthese many years! that some of the best music in the world is being\r\nwritten here at home, and that it only needs the light to win its meed\r\nof praise.\r\n\r\nOwing to the scarcity of printed matter relating to native composers,\r\nand the utter incompleteness and bias of what exists, I have based\r\nthis book almost altogether on my own research. I studied the\r\ncatalogues of all the respectable music publishers, and selected such\r\ncomposers as seemed to have any serious intentions. When I heard of a\r\ncomposer whose work, though earnest, had not been able to find a\r\npublisher, I sought him out and read his manuscripts (a hideous task\r\nwhich might be substituted for the comparative pastime of breaking\r\nrocks, as punishment for misdemeanors). In every case I secured as\r\nmany of each composer's works as could be had in print or in\r\nmanuscript, and endeavored to digest them. Thousands of pieces of\r\nmusic, from short songs to operatic and orchestral scores, I studied\r\nwith all available conscience. The fact that after going through at\r\nleast a ton of American compositions, I am still an enthusiast, is\r\nsurely a proof of some virtue in native music.\r\n\r\nA portion of the result of this study was published _au courant_ in a\r\nmagazine, awakening so much attention that I have at length decided to\r\nyield to constant requests and publish the articles in more accessible\r\nform. The necessity for revising many of the opinions formed hastily\r\nand published immediately, the possibility now of taking the work of\r\nour musicians in some perspective, and the opportunity of bringing my\r\ninformation up to date, have meant so much revision, excision, and\r\naddition, that this book is really a new work.\r\n\r\nThe biographical data have been furnished in practically every case by\r\nthe composers themselves, and are, therefore, reliable in everything\r\nexcept possibly the date of birth. The critical opinions gain their\r\npossibly dogmatic tone rather from a desire for brevity than from any\r\nhope--or wish--that they should be swallowed whole. No attempt to set\r\nup a standard of comparative merit or precedence has been made, though\r\nit is inevitable that certain music-makers should interest one more\r\nthan certain others even more worthy in the eyes of eminent judges.\r\n\r\nIt may be that some inspectors of this book will complain of the\r\nomission of names they had expected to find here. Others will feel a\r\nsense of disproportion. To them there is no reply but a pathetic\r\nallusion to the inevitable incompleteness and asymmetry of all things\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nMany will look with skepticism at the large number of composers I have\r\nthought worthy of inclusion. I can only say that the fact that an\r\nartist has created one work of high merit makes him a good composer in\r\nmy opinion, whether or no he has ever written another, and whether or\r\nno he has afterward fallen into the sere and yellow school of trash.\r\nSo Gray's fame is perennial,--one poem among many banalities.\r\n\r\nBesides, I do not concur in that most commonplace fallacy of\r\ncriticism, the belief that not more than one genius is vouchsafed to\r\nany one period of an art, though this opinion can be justified, of\r\ncourse, by a very exclusive definition of the word genius. To the\r\naverage mind, for instance, the whole literary achievement of the\r\nElizabethan era is condensed into the name of Shakespeare.\r\nContemporary with him, however, there were, of course, thirty or forty\r\nwriters whose best works the scholar would be most unwilling to let\r\ndie. There were, for instance, a dozen playwrights, like Jonson,\r\nFletcher, Ford, Marlowe, and Greene, in whose works can be found\r\nliterary and dramatic touches of the very highest order. There were\r\npoets less prolific than Spenser, and yet to be credited with a few\r\nworks of the utmost beauty, minor geniuses like Ralegh, Sidney, Lodge,\r\nShirley, Lyly, Wotton, Wither, John Donne, Bishop Hall, Drayton,\r\nDrummond, Herbert, Carew, Herrick, Breton, Allison, Byrd, Dowland,\r\nCampion--so one might run on without naming one man who had not\r\nwritten something the world was better for.\r\n\r\nAll periods of great art activity are similarly marked by a large\r\nnumber of geniuses whose ability is not disproved, because\r\novershadowed by the presence of some titanic contemporary. It would be\r\na mere impertinence to state such an axiom of art as this, were it not\r\nthe plain truth that almost all criticism of contemporaries is based\r\nupon an arrant neglect of it; and if it were not for the fact that I\r\nam about to string out a long, long list of American music-makers\r\nwhose ability I think noteworthy,--a list whose length may lead many a\r\nwiseacre to pull a longer face.\r\n\r\nParts of this book have been reprinted from _Godey's Magazine_, the\r\n_Century Magazine_, and the _Criterion_, to whose publishers I am\r\nindebted for permission. For the music reproduced here I have to\r\nthank the publishers whose copyrights were loaned for the occasion.\r\n\r\nIf the book shall only succeed in arousing in some minds an interest\r\nor a curiosity that shall set them to the study of American music (as\r\nI have studied it, with infinite pleasure), then this fine white paper\r\nand this beautiful black ink will not have been wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\nFOREWORD                                                           vii\r\n\r\nA GENERAL SURVEY                                                    11\r\n\r\nTHE INNOVATORS                                                      34\r\n\r\nTHE ACADEMICS                                                      145\r\n\r\nTHE COLONISTS                                                      267\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN COMPOSERS                                                423\r\n\r\nTHE FOREIGN COMPOSERS                                              442\r\n\r\nPOSTLUDE                                                           447\r\n\r\nINDEX                                                              449\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\nAUTOGRAPH OF EDWARD MACDOWELL                                       34\r\n\r\n\"CLAIR DE LUNE,\" BY EDWARD MACDOWELL                                46\r\n\r\nAUTOGRAPH OF EDGAR STILLMAN KELLEY                                  58\r\n\r\n\"ISRAFEL\" (fragment), BY EDGAR STILLMAN KELLEY                      74\r\n\r\nAUTOGRAPH OF HARVEY WORTHINGTON LOOMIS                              77\r\n\r\n\"SANDALPHON\" (fragment), BY H.W.

While\r\nhe still wants encouragement in his good tendencies,--much more\r\nencouragement than he gets, too,--he is now strong enough to profit by\r\nthe discouragement of his evil tendencies.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the American composer is ready for criticism.\r\n\r\nThe first and most vital flaw of which his work will be accused is the\r\nlack of nationalism. This I should like to combat after the sophistic\r\nfashion of Zeno,--showing, first, why we lack that desideratum, a\r\nstrictly national school; secondly, that a strictly national school is\r\nnot desirable; and thirdly, that we most assuredly have a national\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nIn building a national individuality, as in building a personal\r\nindividuality, there is always a period of discipleship under some\r\nolder power. When the rudiments and the essentials are once thoroughly\r\nmastered, the shackles of discipleship are thrown off, and personal\r\nexpression in an original way begins. This is the story of every\r\nmaster in every art: The younger Raphael was only Perugino junior.\r\nBeethoven's first sonatas were more completely Haydn's than the word\r\n\"gewidmet\" would declare. The youthful Canova was swept off his feet\r\nby the unearthing of old Greek masterpieces. Stevenson confesses\r\nfrankly his early efforts to copy the mannerisms of Scott and others.\r\nNations are only clusters of individuals, and subject to the same\r\nrules. Italy borrowed its beginnings from Byzantium; Germany and\r\nFrance took theirs from Italy; we, ours, from them.\r\n\r\nIt was inconceivable that America should produce an autocthonous art.\r\nThe race is one great mixture of more or less digested foreign\r\nelements; and it is not possible to draw a declaration of artistic, as\r\nof political, independence, and thenceforward be truly free.\r\n\r\nCenturies of differentiated environment (in all the senses of the word\r\nenvironment) are needed to produce a new language or a new art; and it\r\nwas inevitable that American music should for long be only a more or\r\nless successful employment of European methods. And there was little\r\npossibility, according to all precedents in art history, that any\r\nstriking individuality should rise suddenly to found a school based\r\nupon his own mannerism.\r\n\r\nEspecially was this improbable, since we are in a large sense of\r\nEnglish lineage. As the co-heirs, with those who remain in the British\r\nIsles, of the magnificent prose and poetry of England, it was possible\r\nfor us to produce early in our own history a Hawthorne and a Poe and\r\nan Emerson and a Whitman. But we have had more hindrance than help\r\nfrom our heritage of English music, in which there has never been a\r\nmaster of the first rank, Purcell and the rest being, after all,\r\nbrilliants of the lesser magnitude (with the permission of that\r\nelectric Englishman, Mr. John F. Runciman).\r\n\r\nA further hindrance was the creed of the Puritan fathers of our\r\ncivilization; they had a granite heart, and a suspicious eye for\r\nmusic. Here is a cheerful example of congregational lyricism, and a\r\nlofty inspiration for musical treatment (the hymn refers to the fate\r\nof unbaptized infants):\r\n\r\n    \"A crime it is! Therefore in Bliss\r\n      You may not hope to dwell;\r\n    But unto you I shall allow\r\n      The easiest room in Hell.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only at the end of the seventeenth century that singing by\r\nnote began to supplant the \"lining-out\" barbarism, and to provoke such\r\nfierce opposition as this:\r\n\r\n    \"First, it is a new way--an unknown tongue; 2d, it is not so\r\n    melodious as the old way; 3d, there are so many tunes that\r\n    nobody can learn them; 4th, the new way makes a disturbance\r\n    in churches, grieves good men, exasperates them, and causes\r\n    them to behave disorderly; 5th, it is popish; 6th, it will\r\n    introduce instruments; 7th, the names of the notes are\r\n    blasphemous; 8th, it is needless, the old way being good\r\n    enough; 9th, it requires too much time to learn it; 10th, it\r\n    makes the young disorderly.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time when such puerility was disturbing this cradle of freedom\r\nand cacophony, Bach and Haendel were at work in their contrapuntal\r\nwebs, the Scarlattis, Corelli and Tartini and Porpora were alive.\r\nPeri, Josquin and Willaert and Lassus were dead, and the church had\r\nhad its last mass from the most famous citizen of the town of\r\nPalestrina. Monteverde was no longer inventing like an Edison; Lulli\r\nhad gone to France and died; and Rameau and Couperin were alive.\r\n\r\nAt this time in the world's art, the Americans were squabbling over\r\nthe blasphemy of instruments and of notation! This is not the place to\r\ntreat the history of our music. The curious can find enlightenment at\r\nsuch sources as Mr. Louis C. Elson's \"National Music of America.\" It\r\nmust be enough for me to say that the throttling hands of Puritanism\r\nare only now fully loosened. Some of our living composers recall the\r\nparental opposition that met their first inclinations to a musical\r\ncareer, opposition based upon the disgracefulness, the heathenishness,\r\nof music as a profession.\r\n\r\nThe youthfulness of our school of music can be emphasized further by a\r\nsimple statement that, with the exception of a few names like Lowell\r\nMason, Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Stephen A. Emery (a graceful writer as\r\nwell as a theorist), and George F. Bristow, practically every American\r\ncomposer of even the faintest importance is now living.\r\n\r\nThe influences that finally made American music are chiefly German.\r\nAlmost all of our composers have studied in Germany, or from teachers\r\ntrained there; very few of them turning aside to Paris, and almost\r\nnone to Italy. The prominent teachers, too, that have come from\r\nabroad have been trained in the German school, whatever their\r\nnationality. The growth of a national school has been necessarily\r\nslow, therefore, for its necessary and complete submission to German\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nIt has been further delayed by the meagre native encouragement to\r\neffort of the better sort. The populace has been largely\r\nindifferent,--the inertia of all large bodies would explain that. A\r\nnational, a constructive, and collaborative criticism has been\r\nconspicuously absent.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of orchestras have also offered an almost insurmountable\r\nobstacle to the production of any work from an American hand until\r\nvery recently. The Boston Symphony Orchestra has been a noble\r\nexception to this rule, and has given about the only opening possible\r\nto the native writer. The Chicago Orchestra, in eight seasons under\r\nTheodore Thomas, devoted, out of a total of 925 numbers, only\r\neighteen, or something less than two per cent., to native music. Yet\r\ntime shows a gradual improvement, and in 1899, out of twenty-seven\r\norchestral numbers performed, three were by Americans, which makes a\r\nliberal tithe. The Boston Symphony has played the compositions of John\r\nKnowles Paine alone more than eighteen times, and those of George W.\r\nChadwick the same number, while E.A. MacDowell and Arthur Foote each\r\nappeared on the programs fourteen times. The Kaltenborn Orchestra has\r\nmade an active effort at the promulgation of our music, and especial\r\nhonor is due to Frank Van der Stucken, himself a composer of marked\r\nabilities; he was among the first to give orchestral production to\r\nAmerican works, and he was, perhaps, the very first to introduce\r\nAmerican orchestral work abroad. Like his offices, in spirit and\r\neffect, have been the invaluable services of our most eminent pianist,\r\nWm. H. Sherwood, who was for many years the only prominent performer\r\nof American piano compositions.\r\n\r\nPublic singers also have been most unpatriotic in preferring endless\r\nrepetition of dry foreign arias to fresh compositions from home. The\r\nlittle encore song, which generally appeared anonymously, was the\r\nopening wedge for the American lyrist.\r\n\r\nUpon the horizon of this gloom, however, there is a tremor of a\r\ndawning interest in national music. Large vocal societies are giving\r\nan increasing number of native part songs and cantatas; prizes are\r\nbeing awarded in various places, and composers find some financial\r\nencouragement for appearing in concerts of their own work. Manuscript\r\nsocieties are organized in many of the larger cities, and these clubs\r\noffer hearing to novelty. There have latterly appeared, from various\r\npublishers, special catalogues vaunting the large number of American\r\ncomposers represented on their lists.\r\n\r\nAnother, and a most important sign of the growing influence of music\r\nupon American life, is seen in the place it is gaining in the college\r\ncurriculum; new chairs have been established, and prominent composers\r\ncalled to fill them, or old professorships that held merely nominal\r\nplaces in the catalogue have been enlarged in scope. In this way music\r\nis reestablishing itself in something like its ancient glory; for the\r\nGreeks not only grouped all culture under the general term of\r\n\"Music,\" but gave voice and instrument a vital place in education.\r\nThree of our most prominent composers fill the chairs at three of the\r\nmost important universities. In all these cases, however, music is an\r\nelective study, while the rudiments of the art should, I am convinced,\r\nbe a required study in every college curriculum, and in the common\r\nschools as well.\r\n\r\nAssuming then, for the nonce, the birth--we are too new a country to\r\nspeak of a Renascence--of a large interest in national music, there is\r\nlarge disappointment in many quarters, because our American music is\r\nnot more American. I have argued above that a race transplanted from\r\nother soils must still retain most of the old modes of expression, or,\r\nvarying them, change slowly. But many who excuse us for the present\r\nlack of a natural nationalism, are so eager for such a differentiation\r\nthat they would have us borrow what we cannot breed.\r\n\r\nThe folk-music of the negro slaves is most frequently mentioned as the\r\nright foundation for a strictly American school. A somewhat\r\nmisunderstood statement advanced by Dr. Antonin Dvorak, brought this\r\nidea into general prominence, though it had been discussed by American\r\ncomposers, and made use of in compositions of all grades long before\r\nhe came here.\r\n\r\nThe vital objection, however, to the general adoption of negro music\r\nas a base for an American school of composition is that it is in no\r\nsense a national expression. It is not even a sectional expression,\r\nfor the white Southerners among whose slaves this music grew, as well\r\nas the people of the North, have always looked upon negro music as an\r\nexotic and curious thing. Familiar as it is to us, it is yet as\r\nforeign a music as any Tyrolean jodel or Hungarian czardas.\r\n\r\nThe music of the American Indian, often strangely beautiful and\r\nimpressive, would be as reasonably chosen as that of these imported\r\nAfrics. E.A. MacDowell had, indeed, written a picturesque and\r\nimpressive Indian suite, some time before the Dvorakian invasion. He\r\nasserts that the Indian music is preferable to the Ethiopian, because\r\nits sturdiness and force are more congenial with the national mood.\r\n\r\nBut the true hope for a national spirit in American music surely lies,\r\nnot in the arbitrary seizure of some musical dialect, but in the\r\ndevelopment of just such a quality as gives us an individuality among\r\nthe nations of the world in respect to our character as a people; and\r\nthat is a Cosmopolitanism made up of elements from all the world, and\r\nyet, in its unified qualities, unlike any one element. Thus our music\r\nshould, and undoubtedly will, be the gathering into the spirit of the\r\nvoices of all the nations, and the use of all their expressions in an\r\nassimilated, a personal, a spontaneous manner. This need not, by any\r\nmeans, be a dry, academic eclecticism. The Yankee, a composite of all\r\npeoples, yet differs from them all, and owns a sturdy individuality.\r\nHis music must follow the same fate.\r\n\r\nAs our governmental theories are the outgrowth of the experiments and\r\nexperiences of all previous history, why should not our music, voicing\r\nas it must the passions of a cosmopolitan people, use cosmopolitan\r\nexpressions? The main thing is the individuality of each artist. To be\r\na citizen of the world, provided one is yet spontaneous and sincere\r\nand original, is the best thing. The whole is greater than any of its\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nAlong just these lines of individualized cosmopolitanism the American\r\nschool is working out its identity. Some of our composers have shown\r\nthemselves the heirs of European lore by work of true excellence in\r\nthe larger classic and romantic forms.\r\n\r\nThe complaint might be made, indeed, that the empty, incorrect period\r\nof previous American music has given place to too much correctness and\r\ntoo close formation on the old models. This is undoubtedly the result\r\nof the long and faithful discipleship under German methods, and need\r\nnot be made much of in view of the tendency among a few masters toward\r\noriginal expression. For, after all, even in the heyday of the\r\ngreatest art periods, only a handful of artists have ever stood out as\r\nstrongly individual; the rest have done good work as faithful\r\nimitators and past masters in technic. It is, then, fortunate that\r\nthere is any tendency at all among any of our composers to forsake\r\nacademic content with classical forms and text-book development of\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nTwo things, however, are matters for very serious disappointment: the\r\nsurprising paucity of musical composition displaying the national\r\nsense of humor, and the surprising abundance of purest namby-pamby.\r\nThe presence of the latter class might be explained by the absence of\r\nthe former, for namby-pamby cannot exist along with a healthy sense\r\nof the ludicrous. There has been a persistent craze among native\r\nsong-writers for little flower-dramas and bird-tragedies, which,\r\naiming at exquisiteness, fall far short of that dangerous goal and\r\nland in flagrant silliness. This weakness, however, will surely\r\ndisappear in time, or at least diminish, until it holds no more\r\nprominent place than it does in all the foreign schools, where it\r\nexists to a certain extent.\r\n\r\nThe scherzo, however, must grow in favor. It is impossible that the\r\nmost jocose of races, a nation that has given the world an original\r\nschool of humor, should not carry this spirit over into its music. And\r\nyet almost none of the comparatively few scherzos that have been\r\nwritten here have had any sense of the hilarious jollity that makes\r\nBeethoven's wit side-shaking. They have been rather of the Chopinesque\r\nsort, mere fantasy. To the composers deserving this generalization I\r\nrecall only two important exceptions, Edgar S. Kelley and Harvey\r\nWorthington Loomis.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities before the American composer are enormous, and only\r\nhalf appreciated. Whereas, in other arts, the text-book claims only to\r\nbe a chronicle of what has been done before, in music the text-book is\r\nset up as the very gospel and decalogue of the art. The theorists have\r\nso thoroughly mapped out the legitimate resources of the composer, and\r\nhave so prescribed his course in nearly every possible position, that\r\nmusic is made almost more of a mathematical problem than the free\r\nexpression of emotions and aesthetics. \"Correct\" music has now hardly\r\nmore liberty than Egyptian sculpture or Byzantine painting once had.\r\nCertain dissonances are permitted, and certain others, no more\r\ndissonant, forbidden, quite arbitrarily, or on hair-splitting\r\ntheories. It is as if one should write down in a book a number of\r\ncharts, giving every scheme of color and every juxtaposition of values\r\npermissible to a painter. The music of certain Oriental nations, in\r\nwhich the religious orders are the art censors, has stuck fast in its\r\nrut because of the observance of rules purely arbitrary. Many of the\r\nconventions of modern European music are no more scientific or\r\noriginal or consistent; most of them are based upon the principle that\r\nthe whim of a great dead composer is worthy to be the law of any\r\nliving composer. These Blue Laws of music are constantly assailed\r\nsurreptitiously and in detail; and yet they are too little attacked as\r\na whole. But music should be a democracy and not an aristocracy, or,\r\nstill less, a hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThere is a great opportunity for America to carry its political\r\nprinciples into this youngest of the arts. It is a gratifying sign\r\nthat one of the most prominent theorists of the time, an American\r\nscholar, A.J. Goodrich, is adopting some such attitude toward music.\r\nHe carries dogma to the minimum, and accepts success in the individual\r\ninstance as sufficient authority for overstepping any general\r\nprinciple. He refers to a contemporary American composer for authority\r\nand example of some successful unconventionality with the same respect\r\nwith which he would quote a European's disregard of convention. His\r\npioneering is watched with interest abroad as well as here.\r\n\r\nWorthy of mention along with Mr. Goodrich' original work is the effort\r\nof Homer A. Norris to instil French ideas of musical theory. As a\r\ncounterweight to the German monopoly of our attention, his influence\r\nis to be cordially welcomed.\r\n\r\nNow that Americanism is rife in the land, some of the glowing interest\r\nin things national might well be turned toward an art that has been\r\ntoo much and too long neglected among us.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to take American music seriously. The day for\r\nboasting is not yet here,--if indeed it ever comes; but the day of\r\npenitent humility is surely past.\r\n\r\nA student of the times, Mr. E.S. Martin, shortly before the Spanish\r\nWar, commented on the radical change that had come over the spirit of\r\nAmerican self-regard. We were notorious in the earlier half of the\r\ncentury for boasting, not only of the virtues we indubitably had, but\r\nof qualities that existed solely in our own imagination. We sounded\r\nour barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. A century of almost\r\nunanimous European disapproval, particularly of our artistic estate,\r\nfinally converted us from this attitude to one of deprecation almost\r\nabject. Having learned the habit of modesty, it has clung to us even\r\nnow, when some of the foremost artists in the world are Americans.\r\n\r\nModesty, is, of course, one of the most beautiful of the virtues, but\r\nexcess is possible and dangerous. As Shakespeare's Florio's Montaigne\r\nhas it: \"We may so seize on vertue, that if we embrace it with an\r\nover-greedy and violent desire, it may become vitious.\" In the case of\r\nthe American composer it is certainly true that we \"excessively\r\ndemeane ourselves in a good action.\" If, then, the glory of our late\r\nsuccesses in the field of battle shall bring about a recrudescence of\r\nour old vanity, it will at least have its compensations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the American artist, having long ago ceased to credit\r\nhimself with all the virtues, has been for years earnestly working out\r\nhis own salvation in that spirit of solemn determination which makes\r\nit proverbial for the American to get anything he sets his heart on.\r\nHe has submitted himself to a devout study of the Old Masters and the\r\nNew; he has made pilgrimage after pilgrimage to the ancient temples of\r\nart, and has brought home influences that cannot but work for good.\r\nThe American painter has won more European acceptance than any of our\r\nother artists, though this is partly due to his persistence in\r\nknocking at the doors of the Paris salons, and gaining the universal\r\nprestige of admission there. There is, unfortunately, no such place\r\nto focus the attention of the world on a musician. Yet, through the\r\nsuccess of American musical students among their rivals abroad;\r\nthrough the concerts they are giving more and more frequently in\r\nforeign countries; through the fact that a number of European music\r\nhouses are publishing increasing quantities of American compositions,\r\nhe is making his way to foreign esteem almost more rapidly than at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nA prominent German critic, indeed, has recently put himself on record\r\nas accepting the founding of an American school of music as a _fait\r\naccompli_. And no student of the times, who will take the trouble to\r\nseek the sources of our art, and observe its actual vitality, need be\r\nashamed of looking at the present state of music in America with a\r\nsubstantial pride and a greater hope for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE INNOVATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edward Alexander MacDowell._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Edward MacDowell]\r\n\r\nThe matter of precedence in creative art is as hopeless of solution as\r\nit is unimportant. And yet it seems appropriate to say, in writing of\r\nE.A. MacDowell, that an almost unanimous vote would grant him rank as\r\nthe greatest of American composers, while not a few ballots would\r\nindicate him as the best of living music writers.\r\n\r\nBut this, to repeat, is not vital, the main thing being that MacDowell\r\nhas a distinct and impressive individuality, and uses his profound\r\nscholarship in the pursuit of novelty that is not cheaply sensational,\r\nand is yet novelty. He has, for instance, theories as to the textures\r\nof sounds, and his chord-formations and progressions are quite his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nHis compositions are superb processions, in which each participant is\r\ngot up with the utmost personal splendor. His generalship is great\r\nenough to preserve the unity and the progress of the pageant. With him\r\nno note in the melody is allowed to go neglected, ill-mounted on\r\ncommon chords in the bass, or cheap-garbed in trite triads. Each tone\r\nis made to suggest something of its multitudinous possibilities.\r\nThrough any geometrical point, an infinite number of lines can be\r\ndrawn. This is almost the case with any note of a melody. It is the\r\nrecognition and the practice of this truth that gives the latter-day\r\nschools of music such a lusciousness and warmth of harmony. No one is\r\na more earnest student of these effects than MacDowell.\r\n\r\nHe believes that it is necessary, at this late day, if you would have\r\na chord \"bite,\" to put a trace of acid in its sweetness. With this\r\nclue in mind, his unusual procedures become more explicable without\r\nlosing their charm.\r\n\r\nNew York is rather the Mecca than the birthplace of artists, but it\r\ncan boast the nativity of MacDowell, who improvised his first songs\r\nhere December 18, 1861. He began the study of the piano at an early\r\nage. One of his teachers was Mme. Teresa Carreno, to whom he has\r\ndedicated his second concerto for the piano.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 he went to Paris and entered the Conservatoire, where he\r\nstudied theory under Savard, and the piano under Marmontel. He went to\r\nWiesbaden to study with Ehlert in 1879, and then to Frankfort, where\r\nCarl Heyman taught him piano and Joachim Raff composition. The\r\ninfluence of Raff is of the utmost importance in MacDowell's music,\r\nand I have been told that the great romancist made a _protege_ of him,\r\nand would lock him in a room for hours till he had worked out the most\r\nappalling musical problems. Through Raff's influence he became first\r\npiano teacher at the Darmstadt Conservatorium in 1881. The next year\r\nRaff introduced him to Liszt, who became so enthusiastic over his\r\ncompositions that he got him the honor of playing his first piano\r\nsuite before the formidable _Allgemeiner Deutscher Musik Verein_,\r\nwhich accorded him a warm reception. The following years were spent in\r\nsuccessful concert work, till 1884, when MacDowell settled down to\r\nteaching and composing in Wiesbaden. Four years later he came to\r\nBoston, writing, teaching, and giving occasional concerts. Thence he\r\nreturned to New York, where he was called to the professorship of\r\nmusic at Columbia University. Princeton University has given him that\r\nunmusical degree, Mus. Doc.\r\n\r\nMacDowell has met little or none of that critical recalcitrance that\r\nblocked the early success of so many masters. His works succeeded from\r\nthe first in winning serious favor; they have been much played in\r\nGermany, in Vienna, St. Petersburg, Amsterdam, and Paris, one of them\r\nhaving been performed three times in a single season at Breslau.\r\n\r\nMacDowell's Scotch ancestry is always telling tales on him. The\r\n\"Scotch snap\" is a constant rhythmic device, the old scale and the old\r\nScottish cadences seem to be native to his heart. Perhaps one might\r\nfind some kinship between MacDowell and the contemporary Glasgow\r\nschool of painters, that clique so isolated, so daring, and yet so\r\nearnest and solid. Says James Huneker in a monograph published some\r\nyears ago: \"His coloring reminds me at times of Grieg, but when I\r\ntracked the resemblance to its lair, I found only Scotch, as Grieg's\r\ngrand-folk were Greggs, and from Scotland. It is all Northern music\r\nwith something elemental in it, and absolutely free from the heavy,\r\nlanguorous odors of the South or the morbidezza of Poland.\"\r\n\r\nSome of MacDowell's most direct writing has been in the setting of the\r\npoems of Burns, such as \"Deserted\" (\"Ye banks and braes o' bonnie\r\nDoon,\" op. 9), \"Menie,\" and \"My Jean\" (op. 34). These are strongly\r\nmarked by that ineffably fine melodic flavor characteristic of\r\nScottish music, while in the accompaniments they admit a touch of the\r\ncomposer's own individuality. In his accompaniments it is noteworthy\r\nthat he is almost never strictly contramelodic.\r\n\r\nThe songs of opera 11 and 12 have a decided Teutonism, but he has\r\nfound himself by opus 40, a volume of \"Six Love Songs,\" containing\r\nhalf a dozen flawless gems it is a pity the public should not know\r\nmore widely. A later book, \"Eight Songs\" (op. 47), is also a cluster\r\nof worthies. The lilt and sympathy of \"The Robin Sings in the\r\nApple-tree,\" and its unobtrusive new harmonies and novel effects, in\r\nstrange accord with truth of expression, mark all the other songs,\r\nparticularly the \"Midsummer Lullaby,\" with its accompaniment as\r\ndelicately tinted as summer clouds. Especially noble is \"The Sea,\"\r\nwhich has all the boom and roll of the deep-brooding ocean.\r\n\r\nHis collections of flower-songs (op. 26) I confess not liking. Though\r\nthey are not without a certain exquisiteness, they seem overdainty\r\nand wastefully frail, excepting, possibly, the \"Clover\" and the\r\n\"Blue-bell.\" It is not at all their brevity, but their triviality,\r\nthat vexes an admirer of the large ability that labored over them.\r\nThey are dedicated to Emilio Agramonte, one of MacDowell's first\r\nprophets, and one of the earliest and most active agents for the\r\nrecognition of the American composer.\r\n\r\nIn the lyrics in opus 56 and opus 58 MacDowell has turned song to the\r\nunusual purposes of a landscape impressionism of places and moods\r\nrather than people.\r\n\r\nFor men's voices there are some deftly composed numbers curiously\r\ndevoted to lullaby subjects. The barcarolle for mixed chorus and\r\naccompaniment on the piano for four hands obtains a wealth of color,\r\nenhanced by the constant division of the voices.\r\n\r\nStudying as he did with Raff, it is but natural that MacDowell should\r\nhave been influenced strongly toward the poetic and fantastic and\r\nprogrammatic elements that mark the \"Forest Symphony\" and the \"Lenore\r\nOverture\" of his master.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say just how far this descriptive music can go. The\r\nskill of each composer must dictate his own limits. As an example of\r\nsuccessful pieces of this kind, consider MacDowell's \"The Eagle.\" It\r\nis the musical realization of Tennyson's well-known poem:\r\n\r\n    \"He clasps the crag with crooked hands;\r\n    Close to the sun in lonely lands,\r\n    Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.\r\n    The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;\r\n    He watches from his mountain walls,\r\n    And like a thunderbolt he falls.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the crag and the crooked hands and the azure world must be\r\ngranted the composer, but general exaltation and loneliness are\r\nexpressed in the severe melody of the opening. The wrinkling and\r\ncrawling of the sea far below are splendidly achieved in the soft,\r\nshimmering liquidity of the music. Then there are two abrupt, but\r\nsoft, short chords that will represent, to the imaginative, the quick\r\nfixing of the eagle's heart on some prey beneath; and there follows a\r\nsudden precipitation down the keyboard, _fortississimo_, that\r\nrepresents the thunderous swoop of the eagle with startling effect.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the \"Moonshine\" seems to be attempting too much.\r\n\"Winter\" does better, for it has a freezing stream, a mill-wheel, and\r\na \"widow bird.\" These \"four little poems\" of opus 32 had been preceded\r\nby six fine \"Idylls\" based on lyrics of Goethe's. The first, a forest\r\nscene, has a distinct flavor of the woods, the second is all laziness\r\nand drowsiness, and the third is moonlight mystery. The fourth is as\r\nintense in its suppressed spring ecstasy as the radiant poem itself\r\nsinging how\r\n\r\n    \"Soft the ripples spill and hurry\r\n    To the opulent embankment.\"\r\n\r\nThe six short \"Poems\" (op. 31) based on poems of Heine's are\r\nparticularly successful, especially in the excellent opportunity of\r\nthe lyric describing the wail of the Scottish woman who plays her harp\r\non the cliff, and sings above the raging of sea and wind. The third\r\ncatches most happily the whimsicality of the poet's reminiscences of\r\nchildhood, but hardly, I think, the contrasting depth and wildness of\r\nhis complaint that, along with childhood's games, have vanished Faith\r\nand Love and Truth. In the last, however, the cheery majesty that\r\nrealizes Heine's likening of Death to a cool night after the sultry\r\nday of Life, is superb.\r\n\r\nThen there are some four-hand pieces, two collections, that leave no\r\nexcuse for clinging to the hackneyed classics or modern trash. They\r\nare not at all difficult, and the second player has something to\r\nemploy his mind besides accompanying chords. They are meaty, and\r\neffective almost to the point of catchiness. The \"Tale of the Knights\"\r\nis full of chivalric fire and martial swing, while the \"Ballad\" is as\r\nexquisitely dainty as a peach-blossom. The \"Hindoo Maiden\" has a deal\r\nof the thoroughly Oriental color and feeling that distinguish the\r\nthree solos of \"Les Orientales,\" of which \"Clair de Lune\" is one of\r\nhis most original and graceful writings. The duet, \"In Tyrol,\" has a\r\nwonderful crystal carillon and a quaint shepherd piping a faint\r\nreminiscence of the Wagnerian school of shepherds. This is one of a\r\nseries of \"Moon Pictures\" for four hands, based on Hans Christian\r\nAndersen's lore. Two concertos for piano and orchestra are dazzling\r\nfeats of virtuosity; one of them is reviewed at length in A.J.\r\nGoodrich' book, \"Musical Analysis.\" He has written also a book of\r\nartistic moment called \"Twelve Virtuoso-Studies,\" and two books of\r\nactual gymnastics for piano practice.\r\n\r\n[Music: CLAIR DE LUNE.\r\n\r\n    La lune etait sereine et jouait sur les flots.\r\n    La fenetre enfin libre est ouverte a la brise;\r\n    La sultane regarde, et la mer qui se brise,\r\n    La-bas, d'un flot d'argent brode les noir ilots.\r\n                 (Victor Hugo, \"Les Orientales.\")\r\n\r\nE.A. MACDOWELL, Op. 37, No. 1.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1889, Arthur P. Schmidt.]\r\n\r\nBut MacDowell did not reach his freedom without a struggle against\r\nacademia. His opus 10 is a piano suite published at the age of\r\ntwenty-two, and opus 14 is another; both contain such obsolescences as\r\na presto, fugue, scherzino, and the like. But for all the classic\r\ngarb, the hands are the hands of Esau. In one of the pieces there is\r\neven a motto tucked, \"All hope leave ye behind who enter here!\" Can he\r\nhave referred to the limbo of classicism?\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry from these to the liberality that inspired the new\r\nimpressionism of \"Woodland Sketches\" (op. 51) and \"Sea Pieces\" (op.\r\n55), in which he gives a legitimate musical presentation of a faintly\r\nperfumed \"Wild Rose\" or \"Water Lily,\" but goes farther, and paints,\r\nwith wonderful tone, the moods inspired by reverie upon the uncouth\r\ndignity and stoic savagery of \"An Indian Lodge,\" the lonely New\r\nEngland twilight of \"A Deserted Farm,\" and all the changing humors of\r\nthe sea, majesty of sunset or star-rise, and even the lucent emerald\r\nof an iceberg. His \"From Uncle Remus\" is not so successful; indeed,\r\nMacDowell is not sympathetic with negro music, and thinks that if we\r\nare to found a national school on some local manner, we should find\r\nthe Indian more congenial than the lazy, sensual slave.\r\n\r\nHe has carried this belief into action, not only by his scientific\r\ninterest in the collection and compilation of the folk-music of our\r\nprairies, but by his artistic use of actual Indian themes in one of\r\nhis most important works, his \"Indian Suite\" for full orchestra, a\r\nwork that has been often performed, and always with the effect of a\r\nnew and profound sensation, particularly in the case of the deeply\r\nimpressive dirge.\r\n\r\nA proof of the success of MacDowell as a writer in the large forms is\r\nthe fact that practically all of his orchestral works are published\r\nin Germany and here, not only in full score, but in arrangement for\r\nfour hands. They include \"Hamlet;\" \"Ophelia\" (op. 22); \"Launcelot and\r\nElaine\" (op. 26), with its strangely mellow and varied use of horns\r\nfor Launcelot, and the entrusting of the plaintive fate of \"the lily\r\nmaid of Astolat\" to the string and wood-wind choirs; \"The Saracens\"\r\nand \"The Lovely Alda\" (op. 30), two fragments from the Song of Roland;\r\nand the Suite (op. 42), which has been played at least eight times in\r\nGermany and eleven times here.\r\n\r\nThe first movement of this last is called \"In a Haunted Forest.\" You\r\nare reminded of Siegfried by the very name of the thing, and the music\r\nenforces the remembrance somewhat, though very slightly.\r\n\r\nEverything reminds one of Wagner nowadays,--even his predecessors.\r\nRudyard Kipling has by his individuality so copyrighted one of the\r\noldest verse-forms, the ballad, that even \"Chevy Chace\" looks like an\r\nadvance plagiarism. So it is with Wagner. Almost all later music, and\r\nmuch of the earlier, sounds Wagnerian. But MacDowell has been reminded\r\nof Bayreuth very infrequently in this work. The opening movement\r\nbegins with a _sotto voce_ syncopation that is very presentative of\r\nthe curious audible silence of a forest. The wilder moments are\r\nsuperbly instrumented.\r\n\r\nThe second movement, \"Summer Idyl,\" is delicious, particularly in the\r\nchances it gives the flautist. There is a fragmentary cantilena which\r\nwould make the fortune of a comic opera. The third number, \"In\r\nOctober,\" is particularly welcome in our music, which is strangely and\r\nsadly lacking in humor. There is fascinating wit throughout this\r\nharvest revel. \"The Shepherdess' Song\" is the fourth movement. It is\r\nnot precieuse, and it is not banal; but its simplicity of pathos is a\r\nwhit too simple. The final number, \"Forest Spirits,\" is a brilliant\r\nclimax. The Suite as a whole is an important work. It has detail of\r\nthe most charming art. Best of all, it is staunchly individual. It is\r\nMacDowellian.\r\n\r\nWhile the modern piano sonata is to me anathema as a rule, there are\r\nnone of MacDowell's works that I like better than his writings in this\r\nform. They are to me far the best since Beethoven, not excepting even\r\nChopin's (_pace_ his greatest prophet, Huneker). They seem to me to be\r\nof such stuff as Beethoven would have woven had he known in fact the\r\nmodern piano he saw in fancy.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sonata Tragica\" (op. 45) begins in G minor, with a bigly\r\npassionate, slow introduction (metronomed in the composer's copy,\r\n[quarter-note]-50). The first subject is marked in the same copy,\r\nthough not in the printed book, [half-note]-69, and the appealingly\r\npathetic second subject is a little slower. The free fantasy is full\r\nof storm and stress, with a fierce pedal-point on the trilled\r\nleading-tone. In the reprise the second subject, which was at first in\r\nthe dominant major, is now in the tonic major, though the key of the\r\nsonata is G minor. The allegro is metronomed [quarter-note]-138, and\r\nit is very short and very wild. Throughout, the grief is the grief of\r\na strong soul; it never degenerates into whine. Its largo is like the\r\ntread of an AEschylean _choros_, its allegro movements are wild with\r\nanguish, and the occasional uplifting into the major only emphasizes\r\nthe sombre whole, like the little rifts of clearer harmony in\r\nBeethoven's \"Funeral March on the Death of a Hero.\"\r\n\r\nThe last movement begins with a ringing _pomposo_, and I cannot\r\nexplain its meaning better than by quoting Mrs. MacDowell's words:\r\n\"Mr. MacDowell's idea was, so to speak, as follows: He wished to\r\nheighten the darkness of tragedy by making it follow closely on the\r\nheels of triumph. Therefore, he attempted to make the last movement a\r\nsteadily progressive triumph, which, at its climax, is utterly broken\r\nand shattered. In doing this he has tried to epitomize the whole work.\r\nWhile in the other movements he aimed at expressing tragic details,\r\nin the last he has tried to generalize; thinking that the most\r\npoignant tragedy is that of catastrophe in the hour of triumph.\"\r\n\r\nThe third sonata (op. 57) is dedicated to Grieg and to the musical\r\nexploitation of an old-time Skald reciting glorious battles, loves,\r\nand deaths in an ancient castle. The atmosphere of mystery and\r\nbarbaric grandeur is obtained and sustained by means new to piano\r\nliterature and potent in color and vigor. The sonata formula is warped\r\nto the purpose of the poet, but the themes have the classic ideal of\r\nkinship. The battle-power of the work is tremendous. Huneker calls it\r\n\"an epic of rainbow and thunder,\" and Henry T. Finck, who has for many\r\nyears devoted a part of his large ardor to MacDowell's cause, says of\r\nthe work: \"It is MacDowellish,--more MacDowellish than anything he has\r\nyet written. It is the work of a musical thinker. There are harmonies\r\nas novel as those we encounter in Schubert, Chopin, or Grieg, yet with\r\na stamp of their own.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Sonata Eroica\" (op. 50) bears the legend \"Flos regum Arthurus.\"\r\nIt is also in G minor. The spirit of King Arthur dominates the work\r\nideally, and justifies not only the ferocious and warlike first\r\nsubject with its peculiar and influential rhythm, but the\r\nold-fashioned and unadorned folk-tone of the second subject. In the\r\nworking out there is much bustle and much business of trumpets. In the\r\nreprise the folk-song appears in the tonic minor, taken most\r\nunconventionally in the bass under elaborate arpeggiations in the\r\nright hand. The coda, as in the other sonata, is simply a strong\r\npassage of climax. Arthur's supernatural nature doubtless suggested\r\nthe second movement, with its elfin airs, its flibbertigibbet\r\nvirtuosity, and its magic of color. The third movement might have been\r\ninspired by Tennyson's version of Arthur's farewell to Guinevere, it\r\nis such a rich fabric of grief. The finale seems to me to picture the\r\nMorte d'Arthur, beginning with the fury of a storm along the coast,\r\nand the battle \"on the waste sand by the waste sea.\" Moments of fire\r\nare succeeded by exquisite deeps of quietude, and the death and\r\napotheosis of Arthur are hinted with daring and complete equivalence\r\nof art with need.\r\n\r\nHere is no longer the tinkle and swirl of the elf dances; here is no\r\nmore of the tireless search for novelty in movement and color. This is\r\n\"a flash of the soul that can.\" Here is Beethoven _redivivus_. For\r\nhalf a century we have had so much pioneering and scientific\r\nexploration after piano color and tenderness and fire, that men have\r\nneglected its might and its tragic powers. Where is the piano-piece\r\nsince Beethoven that has the depth, the breadth, the height of this\r\nhuge solemnity? Chopin's sensuous wailing does not afford it.\r\nSchumann's complex eccentricities have not given it out. Brahms is too\r\npassionless. Wagner neglected the piano. It remained for a Yankee to\r\nfind the austere peak again! and that, too, when the sonata was\r\nsupposed to be a form as exhausted as the epic poem. But all this is\r\nthe praise that one is laughed at for bestowing except on the graves\r\nof genius.\r\n\r\nThe cautious Ben Jonson, when his erstwhile taproom roisterer, Will\r\nShakespeare, was dead, defied \"insolent Greece or haughty Rome\" to\r\nshow his superior. With such authority, I feel safe in at least\r\ndefying the contemporary schools of insolent Russia or haughty Germany\r\nto send forth a better musicwright than our fellow townsman, Edward\r\nMacDowell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar Stillman Kelley._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDGAR STILLMAN KELLEY.]\r\n\r\nWhile his name is known wherever American music is known in its better\r\naspects, yet, like many another American, his real art can be\r\ndiscovered only from his manuscripts. In these he shows a very\r\nmunificence of enthusiasm, scholarship, invention, humor, and\r\noriginality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Edgar Stillman Kelley]\r\n\r\nKelley is as thorough an American by descent as one could ask for, his\r\nmaternal ancestors having settled in this country in 1630, his\r\npaternal progenitors in 1640, A.D. Indeed, one of the ancestors of\r\nhis father made the dies for the pine-tree shilling, and a\r\ngreat-great-grandfather fought in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nKelley began his terrestrial career April 14, 1857, in Wisconsin. His\r\nfather was a revenue officer; his mother a skilled musician, who\r\ntaught him the piano from his eighth year to his seventeenth, when he\r\nwent to Chicago and studied harmony and counterpoint under Clarence\r\nEddy, and the piano under Ledochowski. It is interesting to note that\r\nKelley was diverted into music from painting by hearing \"Blind Tom\"\r\nplay Liszt's transcription of Mendelssohn's \"Midsummer Night's Dream\"\r\nmusic. I imagine that this idiot-genius had very little other\r\ninfluence of this sort in his picturesque career.\r\n\r\nAfter two years in Chicago, Kelley went to Germany, where, in\r\nStuttgart, he studied the piano with Kruger and Speidel, organ with\r\nFinck, composition and orchestration with Seiffritz. While in Germany,\r\nKelley wrote a brilliant and highly successful concert polonaise for\r\nfour hands, and a composition for strings.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 he was back in America and settled in San Francisco, with\r\nwhose musical life he was long and prominently identified as a\r\nteacher and critic. Here he wrote his first large work, the well-known\r\nmelodramatic music to \"Macbeth.\" A local benefactor, John Parrot, paid\r\nthe expenses of a public performance, the great success of which\r\npersuaded McKee Rankin, the actor, to make an elaborate production of\r\nboth play and music. This ran for three weeks in San Francisco to\r\ncrowded houses, which is a remarkable record for many reasons. A\r\nshabby New York production at an ill-chosen theatre failed to give the\r\nwork an advantageous hearing; but it has been played by orchestras\r\nseveral times since, and William H. Sherwood has made transcriptions\r\nof parts of it for piano solo.\r\n\r\nThe \"Macbeth\" music is of such solid value that it reaches the dignity\r\nof a flowing commentary. Beyond and above this it is an interpretation,\r\nmaking vivid and awesome the deep import of the play, till even the\r\nleast imaginative auditor must feel its thrill.\r\n\r\nThus the gathering of the witches begins with a slow horror, which is\r\nsurely Shakespeare's idea, and not the comic-opera _can-can_ it is\r\nfrequently made. As various other elfs and terrors appear, they are\r\nappropriately characterized in the music, which also adds mightily to\r\nthe terror of the murder scene. Throughout, the work is that of a\r\nthinker. Like much of Kelley's other music, it is also the work of a\r\nfearless and skilled programmatist, especially in the battle-scenes,\r\nwhere it suggests the crash of maces and swords, and the blare of\r\nhorns, the galloping of horses, and the general din of huge battle.\r\nLeading-motives are much used, too, with good effect and most\r\ningenious elaboration, notably the _Banquo_ motive. A certain amount\r\nof Gaelic color also adds interest to the work, particularly a\r\nstirring Gaelic march. The orchestration shows both scholarship and\r\ndaring.\r\n\r\nAn interesting subject is suggested by Kelley's experience in hunting\r\nout a good motif for the galloping horses of \"Macbeth.\" He could find\r\nnothing suitably representative of storm-hoofed chargers till his\r\ndreams came to the rescue with a genuinely inspired theme. Several\r\nother exquisite ideas have come to him in his sleep in this way; one\r\nof them is set down in the facsimile reproduced herewith. On one\r\noccasion he even dreamed an original German poem and a fitting musical\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nDr. Wm. A. Hammond, in his book on \"Sleep and Its Derangements,\" is\r\ninclined to scout the possibility of a really valuable inspiration in\r\nsleep. He finds no satisfactory explanation for Tartini's famous\r\n\"Devil's Sonata\" or Coleridge' proverbial \"Kubla Khan.\" He takes\r\nrefuge in saying that at least the result could not be equal to the\r\ndreamer's capabilities when awake; but Kelley's \"Macbeth\" music was\r\ncertainly an improvement on what he could invent out of the land of\r\nNod.\r\n\r\nAfter composing a comic opera, which was refused by the man for whom\r\nit was written because it was too good, he drifted into journalism,\r\nand wrote reviews and critiques which show a very liberal mind capable\r\nof appreciating things both modern and classic.\r\n\r\nKelley was again persuaded to write a comic opera to the artistic\r\nlibretto, \"Puritania,\" by C.M.S. McLellan, a brilliant satirist,\r\nwho has since won fortune by his highly successful and frequently\r\nartistic burlesquery. The work won excellent praise in Boston, where\r\nit had one hundred performances. The work musically was not only\r\nconscientious, but really graceful and captivating. It received the\r\nmost glowing encomiums from people of musical culture, and largely\r\nenhanced Kelley's musical reputation in its run of something over a\r\nyear. On its tour Kelley was also the musical conductor, in which\r\ncapacity he has frequently served elsewhere.\r\n\r\nKelley plainly deserves preeminence among American composers for his\r\ndevotion to, and skill in, the finer sorts of humorous music. No other\r\nAmerican has written so artfully, so happily, or so ambitiously in\r\nthis field. A humorous symphony and a Chinese suite are his largest\r\nworks on this order.\r\n\r\nThe symphony follows the life of \"Gulliver in Lilliput.\" In\r\ndevelopment and intertwining of themes and in brilliance of\r\norchestration, it maintains symphonic dignity, while in play of fancy,\r\nsuggestive programmaticism, and rollicking enthusiasm it is infectious\r\nwith wit. Gulliver himself is richly characterized with a burly,\r\nblustering English theme. The storm that throws him on the shores of\r\nLilliput is handled with complete mastery, certain phrases picturing\r\nthe toss of the billows, another the great roll of the boat, others\r\nthe rattle of the rigging and the panic of the crew; and all wrought\r\nup to a demoniac climax at the wreck. As the stranded Gulliver falls\r\nasleep, the music hints his nodding off graphically. The entrance of\r\nthe Lilliputians is perhaps the happiest bit of the whole delicious\r\nwork. By adroit devices in instrumentation, their tiny band toots a\r\nminute national hymn of irresistible drollery. The sound of their wee\r\nhammers and the rest of the ludicrous adventures are carried off in\r\nunfailing good humor. The scene finally changes to the rescuing ship.\r\nHere a most hilarious hornpipe is interrupted by the distant call of\r\nGulliver's aria, and the rescue is consummated delightfully.\r\n\r\nIn nothing has Kelley showed such wanton scholarship and such\r\nfree-reined fancy as in his Chinese suite for orchestra, \"Aladdin.\" It\r\nis certainly one of the most brilliant musical feats of the\r\ngeneration, and rivals Richard Strauss in orchestral virtuosity.\r\n\r\nWhile in San Francisco, where, as every one knows, there is a\r\ntransplanted corner of China, Kelley sat at the feet of certain\r\nCelestial cacophonists, and made himself adept. He fathomed the, to\r\nus, obscure laws of their theory, and for this work made a careful\r\nselection of Chinese musical ideas, and used what little harmony they\r\napprove of with most quaint and suggestive effect upon a splendid\r\nbackground of his own. The result has not been, as is usual in such\r\nalien mimicries, a mere success of curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe work had its first accolade of genius in the wild protests of the\r\nmusic copyists, and in the downright mutiny of orchestral performers.\r\n\r\nOn the first page of the score is this note: \"This should be played\r\nwith a bow unscrewed, so that the hairs hang loose--thus the bow never\r\nleaves the string.\" This direction is evidently meant to secure the\r\neffect of the Chinese violin, in which the string passes between the\r\nhair and the wood of the bow, and is played upon the under side. But\r\nwhat self-respecting violinist could endure such profanation without\r\nstriking a blow for his fanes?\r\n\r\nThe first movement of the suite is made up of themes actually learned\r\nfrom Chinese musicians. It represents the \"Wedding of Aladdin and the\r\nPrincess,\" a sort of sublimated \"shivaree\" in which oboes quawk, muted\r\ntrumpets bray, pizzicato strings flutter, and mandolins (loved of\r\nBerlioz) twitter hilariously.\r\n\r\nThe second movement, \"A Serenade in the Royal Pear Garden,\" begins\r\nwith a luxurious tone-poem of moonlight and shadow, out of which,\r\nafter a preliminary tuning of the Chinese lute (or sam-yin), wails a\r\nlyric caterwaul (alternately in 2-4 and 3-4 tempo) which the Chinese\r\ntranslate as a love-song. Its amorous grotesque at length subsides\r\ninto the majestic night. A part of this altogether fascinating\r\nmovement came to Kelley in a dream.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter is devoted to the \"Flight of the Genie with the\r\nPalace,\" and there is a wonderfully vivid suggestion of his struggle\r\nto wrest loose the foundations of the building. At length he heaves it\r\nslowly in the air, and wings majestically away with it.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me that the purest stroke of genius in\r\ninstrumentation ever evinced was Wagner's conceit of using tinkling\r\nbells to suggest leaping flames. And yet quite comparable with this\r\nseems Kelley's device to indicate the oarage of the genie's mighty\r\nwings as he disappears into the sky: liquid _glissandos_ on the upper\r\nharp-strings, with chromatic runs upon the elaborately divided\r\nviolins, at length changed to sustained and most ethereally fluty\r\nharmonics. It is very ravishment.\r\n\r\nThe last movement, \"The Return and Feast of the Lanterns,\" is on the\r\nsonata formula. After an introduction typifying the opening of the\r\ntemple gates (a gong giving the music further locale), the first theme\r\nis announced by harp and mandolin. It is an ancient Chinese air for\r\nthe yong-kim (a dulcimer-like instrument). The second subject is\r\nadapted from the serenade theme. With these two smuggled themes\r\neverything contrapuntal (a fugue included) and instrumental is done\r\nthat technical bravado could suggest or true art license. The result\r\nis a carnival of technic that compels the layman to wonder and the\r\nscholar to homage.\r\n\r\nA transcription for a piano duet has been made of this last movement.\r\n\r\nIn Chinese-tone also is Kelley's most popular song, \"The Lady Picking\r\nMulberries,\" which brought him not only the enthusiasm of Americans\r\nbut the high commendation of the Chinese themselves. It is written in\r\nthe limited Chinese scale, with harmonies of our school; and is a\r\nhumoresque of such catchiness that it has pervaded even London and\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThis song is one of a series of six lyrics called \"The Phases of\r\nLove,\" with this motive from the \"Anatomy of Melancholy\": \"I am\r\nresolved, therefore, in this tragi-comedy of love, to act several\r\nparts, some satirically, some comically, some in a mixed tone.\" The\r\npoems are all by American poets, and the group, opus 6, is an\r\ninvaluable addition to our musical literature. The first of the\r\nseries, \"My Silent Song,\" is a radiantly beautiful work, with a\r\nwondrous tender air to a rapturous accompaniment. The second is a\r\nsetting of Edward Rowland Sill's perfect little poem, \"Love's Fillet.\"\r\nThe song is as full of art as it is of feeling and influence. \"What\r\nthe Man in the Moon Saw\" is an engaging satire, \"Love and Sleep\" is\r\nsombre, and \"In a Garden\" is pathetic.\r\n\r\nBesides two small sketches, a waltz and a gavotte, and his own\r\narrangements, for two and for four hands, of the Gaelic March in\r\n\"Macbeth,\" Kelley has published only three piano pieces: opus 2, \"The\r\nFlower Seekers,\" superb with grace, warm harmony, and May ecstasies;\r\n\"Confluentia,\" whose threads of liquidity are eruditely, yet\r\nromantically, intertangled to represent the confluence of the Rhine\r\nand the Moselle; and \"The Headless Horseman,\" a masterpiece of\r\nburlesque weirdness, representing the wild pursuit of Ichabod Crane\r\nand the final hurling of the awful head,--a pumpkin, some say. It is\r\nrelieved by Ichabod's tender reminiscences of Katrina Van Tassel at\r\nthe spinning-wheel, and is dedicated to Joseffy, the pianist, who\r\nlives in the region about Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nTo supplement his successful, humorously melodramatic setting of \"The\r\nLittle Old Woman who Went to the Market her Eggs for to Sell,\" Kelley\r\nis preparing a series of similar pieces called \"Tales Retold for\r\nMusical Children.\" It will include \"Gulliver,\" \"Aladdin,\" and \"Beauty\r\nand the Beast.\"\r\n\r\nKelley once wrote music for an adaptation of \"Prometheus Bound,\" made\r\nby the late George Parsons Lathrop for that ill-starred experiment,\r\nthe Theatre of Arts and Letters. The same thoroughness of research\r\nthat gave Kelley such a command of Chinese theories equipped him in\r\nwhat knowledge we have of Greek and the other ancient music. He has\r\ndelivered a course of lectures on these subjects, and this learning\r\nwas put to good and public use in his share in the staging of the\r\nnovel \"Ben Hur.\" His music had a vital part in carrying the play over\r\nthe thin ice of sacrilege; it was so reverent and so appealing that\r\nthe scrubwomen in the theatre were actually moved to tears during its\r\nrehearsal, and it gave the scene of the miraculous cure of the lepers\r\na dignity that saved it from either ridicule or reproach.\r\n\r\nIn the first act there is a suggestion of the slow, soft march of a\r\ncaravan across the sand, the eleven-toned Greek and Egyptian scale\r\nbeing used. In the tent of the Sheik, an old Arabian scale is\r\nemployed. In the elaborate ballets and revels in the \"Grove of Daphne\"\r\nthe use of Greek scales, Greek progressions (such as descending\r\nparallel fourths long forbidden by the doctors of our era), a\r\ntrimetrical grouping of measures (instead of our customary fourfold\r\nbasis), and a suggestion of Hellenic instruments,--all this lore has\r\nnot robbed the scene in any sense of an irresistible brilliance and\r\nspontaneity. The weaving of Arachne's web is pictured with especial\r\npower. Greek traditions have, of course, been used only for\r\noccasional impressionisms, and not as manacles. Elaborately colored\r\nmodern instrumentation and all the established devices from canon up\r\nare employed. A piano transcription of part of the music is promised.\r\nThe \"Song of Iras\" has been published. It is full of home-sickness,\r\nand the accompaniment (not used in the production) is a wonderwork of\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n    Tottering above\r\n    In her highest noon\r\n    The enamoured moon blushes with love\r\n    While to listen\r\n    The red levin\r\n    With the rapid pleiads even\r\n    Which were seven\r\n    Pauses in heaven!\r\n    Pauses in heaven!\r\n    And they say the starry choir\r\n    And the other listening things,\r\n    That Israfel's fire is owing to that lyre\r\n    By which he sits and sings\r\n    The trembling living wire\r\n    Of those unusual strings\r\n    Of those unusual strings.\r\n\r\nBy permission.\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF \"ISRAFEL,\" BY EDGAR S. KELLEY.]\r\n\r\nKelley has two unpublished songs that show him at his best, both\r\nsettings of verse by Poe,--\"Eldorado,\" which vividly develops the\r\npersistence of the knight, and \"Israfel.\" This latter poem, as you\r\nknow, concerns the angel \"whose heart-strings are a lute.\" After a\r\nrhapsody upon the cosmic spell of the angel's singing, Poe, with a\r\nbrave defiance, flings an implied challenge to him. The verse marks\r\none of the highest reaches of a genius honored abroad as a world-great\r\nlyrist. It is, perhaps, praise enough, then, to say that Kelley's\r\nmusic flags in no wise behind the divine progress of the words. The\r\nlute idea dictates an arpeggiated accompaniment, whose harmonic beauty\r\nand courage is beyond description and beyond the grasp of the mind at\r\nthe first hearing. The bravery of the climax follows the weird and\r\nopiate harmonies of the middle part with tremendous effect. The song\r\nis, in my fervent belief, a masterwork of absolute genius, one of the\r\nvery greatest lyrics in the world's music.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvey Worthington Loomis._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARVEY WORTHINGTON LOOMIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Harvey Worthington Loomis]\r\n\r\nIn the band of pupils that gathered to the standard of the invader,\r\nAntonin Dvorak, when, in 1892, he came over here from Macedonia to\r\nhelp us, some of the future's best composers will probably be found.\r\n\r\nOf this band was Harvey Worthington Loomis, who won a three years'\r\nscholarship in Doctor Dvorak's composition class at the National\r\nConservatory, by submitting an excellent, but rather uncharacteristic,\r\nsetting of Eichendorff's \"Fruehlingsnacht.\" Loomis evidently won\r\nDoctor Dvorak's confidence, for among the tasks imposed on him was a\r\npiano concerto to be built on the lines of so elaborate a model as\r\nRubinstein's in D minor. When Loomis' first sketches showed an\r\nelaboration even beyond the complex pattern, Dvorak still advised him\r\nto go on. To any one that knows the ways of harmony teachers this will\r\nmean much.\r\n\r\nLoomis (who was born in Brooklyn, February 5, 1865, and is now a\r\nresident of New York) pursued studies in harmony and piano in a\r\ndesultory way until he entered Doctor Dvorak's class. For his musical\r\ntastes he was indebted to the artistic atmosphere of his home.\r\n\r\nThough Loomis has written something over five hundred compositions,\r\nonly a few works have been published, the most important of which are\r\n\"Fairy Hill,\" a cantatilla for children, published in 1896 (it was\r\nwritten on a commission that fortunately allowed him liberty for not a\r\nlittle elaboration and individuality), \"Sandalphon,\" and a few songs\r\nand piano pieces.\r\n\r\nA field of his art that has won his especial interest is the use of\r\nmusic as an atmosphere for dramatic expression. Of this sort are a\r\nnumber of pantomimes, produced with much applause in New York by the\r\nAcademy of Dramatic Arts; and several musical backgrounds. The 27th of\r\nApril, 1896, a concert of his works was given by a number of\r\nwell-known artists.\r\n\r\nThese musical backgrounds are played in accompaniment to dramatic\r\nrecitations. Properly managed, the effect is most impressive. Feval's\r\npoem, \"The Song of the Pear-tree,\" is a typically handled work. The\r\npoem tells the story of a young French fellow, an orphan, who goes to\r\nthe wars as substitute for his friend Jean. After rising from rank to\r\nrank by bravery, he returns to his home just as his sweetheart,\r\nPerrine, enters the church to wed Jean. The girl had been his one\r\nambition, and now in his despair he reenlists and begs to be placed in\r\nthe thickest of danger. When he falls, they find on his breast a\r\nwithered spray from the pear-tree under which Perrine had first\r\nplighted troth. On these simple lines the music builds up a drama.\r\nFrom the opening shimmer and rustle of the garden, through the\r\nGregorian chant that solemnizes the drawing of the lots, and is\r\ninterrupted by the youth's start of joy at his own luck (an abrupt\r\n_glissando_); through his sturdy resolve to go to war in his friend's\r\nplace, on through many battles to his death, all is on a high plane\r\nthat commands sympathy for the emotion, and enforces unbounded\r\nadmiration for the art. There is a brief hint of the Marseillaise\r\nwoven into the finely varied tapestry of martial music, and when the\r\nlover comes trudging home, his joy, his sudden knowledge of Perrine's\r\nfaithlessness, and his overwhelming grief are all built over a long\r\norgan-point of three clangorous bride-bells. The _leit-motif_ idea is\r\nused with suggestive clearness throughout the work.\r\n\r\nThe background to Longfellow's \"Sandalphon\" is so fine an arras that\r\nit gives the poet a splendor not usual to his bourgeois lays. The\r\nmusic runs through so many phases of emotion, and approves itself so\r\noriginal and exaltedly vivid in each that I put it well to the fore\r\nof American compositions.\r\n\r\nHardly less large is the--Loomis calls it \"Musical Symbolism,\" for\r\nAdelaide Ann Proctor's \"The Story of the Faithful Soul.\" Of the\r\ngreatest delicacy imaginable is the music (for piano, violin, and\r\nvoice) to William Sharp's \"Coming of the Prince.\" The \"Watteau\r\nPictures\" are poems of Verlaine's variously treated: one as a\r\nhead-piece to a wayward piano caprice, one to be recited during a\r\npicturesque waltz, the last a song with mandolin effects in the\r\naccompaniment.\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n    How, erect, at the outermost gates of the City\r\n    Celestial he waits,\r\n    With his feet on the ladder of light,\r\n    That, crowded with angels unnumbered,\r\n    By Jacob was seen as he slumbered\r\n    Alone in the desert at night?\r\n    The Angels of Wind and of Fire\r\n    Chant only one hymn, and expire\r\n    With the song's irresistible stress,\r\n    Expire in their rapture and wonder,\r\n    As harp-strings are broken asunder\r\n    By music they throb to express.\r\n    But serene in the rapturous throng,\r\n    Unmoved by the rush of the song,\r\n    With eyes unimpassioned and slow,\r\n    Among the dead angels, the deathless\r\n    Sandalphon stands listening, breathless,\r\n    To sounds that ascend from below,...\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1896, by Edgar S. Werner.\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT OF \"SANDALPHON,\" BY H.W. LOOMIS.]\r\n\r\nThe pantomimes range from grave to gay, most of the librettos in this\r\ndifficult form being from the clever hand of Edwin Starr Belknap.\r\n\"The Traitor Mandolin,\" \"In Old New Amsterdam,\" \"Put to the Test,\"\r\n\"Blanc et Noir,\" \"The Enchanted Fountain,\" \"Her Revenge,\" \"Love and\r\nWitchcraft\" are their names. The music is full of wit, a quality\r\nLoomis possesses in unusual degree. The music mimics everything from\r\nthe busy feather-duster of the maid to her eavesdropping. Pouring\r\nwine, clinking glasses, moving a chair, tearing up a letter, and a\r\nrollicking wine-song in pantomime are all hinted with the drollest and\r\nmost graphic programmism imaginable.\r\n\r\nLoomis has also written two burlesque operas, \"The Maid of Athens\" and\r\n\"The Burglar's Bride,\" the libretto of the latter by his brother,\r\nCharles Battell Loomis, the well-known humorist. This latter contains\r\nsome skilful parody on old fogyism.\r\n\r\nIn the Violin Sonata the piano, while granting precedence to the\r\nviolin, approaches almost to the dignity of a duet. The finale is\r\ncaptivating and brilliant, and develops some big climaxes. The work as\r\na whole is really superb, and ought to be much played. There are,\r\nbesides, a \"Lyric Finale\" to a sonata not yet written, and several\r\nsongs for violin, voice, and piano.\r\n\r\nA suite for four hands, \"In Summer Fields,\" contains some happy\r\nmanifestations of ability, such as \"A June Roundelay,\" \"The Dryad's\r\nGrove,\" and, especially, a humoresque \"Junketing,\" which is surely\r\ndestined to become a classic. From some of his pantomimes Loomis has\r\nmade excerpts, and remade them with new elaboration for two pianos,\r\nunder the name of \"Exotics.\" These are full of variety and of actual\r\nnovelty, now of startling discord, now of revelatory beauty. A\r\nso-called \"Norland Epic,\" freely constructed on the sonata formula, is\r\none of Loomis' most brilliant and personal achievements.\r\n\r\nLoomis has an especial aptitude for writing artistic ballet-music, and\r\nfor composing in the tone of different nationalities, particularly the\r\nSpanish. His pantomimes contain many irresistible dances, one of them\r\nincluding a Chinese dance alternating 4-4 with 3-4 time. His\r\nstrikingly fleet \"Harlequin\" has been published.\r\n\r\nThe gift of adding art to catchiness is a great one. This Loomis\r\nseems to have to an unusual degree, as is evidenced by the dances in\r\nhis pantomimes and his series of six pieces \"In Ballet Costume,\" all\r\nof them rich with the finest art along with a Strauss-like\r\nspontaneity. These include \"L'Amazone,\" \"Pirouette,\" \"Un Pas Seul,\"\r\n\"La Coryphee,\" \"The Odalisque,\" and \"The Magyar.\" One of his largest\r\nworks is a concert waltz, \"Mi-Careme,\" for two pianos, with elaborate\r\nand extended introduction and coda.\r\n\r\nA series of Genre Pictures contains such lusciousness of felicity as\r\n\"At an Italian Festival,\" and there are a number of musical moments of\r\nengaging charm, for instance, \"N'Importe Quoi,\" \"From a Conservatory\r\nProgram,\" \"A Tropical Night,\" a fascinating \"Valsette,\" a nameless\r\nvalse, and \"Another Scandal,\" which will prove a gilt-edged\r\nspeculation for some tardy publisher. It is brimming with the\r\ndelicious horror of excited gossipry. An example of how thoroughly\r\nLoomis is invested with music--how he thinks in it--is his audacious\r\nscherzo, \"The Town Crier,\" printed herewith.\r\n\r\nIn songs Loomis has been most prolific. He has set twenty-two of\r\nShakespeare's lyrics to music of the old English school, such as his\r\nuproarious \"Let me the cannikin clink,\" and his dainty \"Tell me where\r\nis fancy bred.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lark\" is written in the pentatonic scale, with accompaniment for\r\ntwo flutes and a harp.\r\n\r\nIn the same vein are various songs of Herrick, a lyrist whose verse\r\nis not usually congenial to the modern music-maker. Loomis' \"Epitaph\r\non a Virgin\" must be classed as a success. Indeed, it reaches positive\r\ngrandeur at its climax, wherein is woven the grim persistence of a\r\ntolling bell. In the same style is a clever setting of Ben Jonson's\r\nmuch music'd \"To Celia.\"\r\n\r\nIn German-tone are his veritably magnificent \"Herbstnacht\" and his \"At\r\nMidnight,\" two studies after Franz. Heine's \"Des Waldes Kapellmeister\"\r\nhas been made into a most hilarious humoresque.\r\n\r\n\"Bergerie\" is a dozen of Norman Gale's lyrics. \"Andalusia\" is a\r\nflamboyant duet.\r\n\r\nIn Scotch songs there is a positive embarrassment of riches, Loomis'\r\nfancies finding especial food and freedom in this school. I find in\r\nthese settings far more art and grace than I see even in Schumann's\r\nmany Scotch songs, or those of any other of the Germans. \"Oh, for Ane\r\nand Twenty\" has bagpipe effects. Such flights of ecstasy as \"My Wife's\r\na Winsome Wee Thing,\" and \"Bonnie Wee Thing,\" are simply tyrannical in\r\ntheir appeal. Then there is an irresistible \"Polly Stewart;\" and \"My\r\nPeggy's Heart\" is fairly ambrosial. These and several others, like\r\n\"There Was a Bonnie Lass,\" could be made into an album of songs that\r\nwould delight a whole suite of generations.\r\n\r\nA number of his songs are published: they include a \"John Anderson, My\r\nJo,\" that has no particular right to live; a ballad, \"Molly,\" with a\r\ntouch of art tucked into it; the beautiful \"Sylvan Slumbers,\" and the\r\nquaint and fascinating \"Dutch Garden.\"\r\n\r\nAside from an occasional song like \"Thistledown,\" with its brilliantly\r\nfleecy accompaniment, and the setting of Browning's famous \"The Year'\r\nat the Spring,\" for which Loomis has struck out a superb frenzy, and a\r\ngroup of songs by John Vance Cheney, Loomis has found some of his most\r\npowerful inspirations in the work of our lyrist, Aldrich,--such as\r\nthe rich carillon of \"Wedded,\" and his \"Discipline,\" one of the best\r\nof all humorous songs, a gruesome scherzo all about dead monks, in\r\nwhich the music furnishes out the grim irreverence of the words with\r\nthe utmost waggery.\r\n\r\nChief among the lyrics by Cheney are three \"Spring Songs,\" in which\r\nLoomis has caught the zest of spring with such rapture that, once they\r\nare heard, the world seems poor without them in print. Loomis'\r\nliterary culture is shown in the sure taste of his selection of lyrics\r\nfor his music. He has marked aptitudes, too, in creative literature,\r\nand has an excellent idea of the arts kindred to his own, particularly\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nLike Chopin, Loomis is largely occupied in mixing rich new colors on\r\nthe inexhaustible palette of the piano. Like Chopin, he is not\r\nespecially called to the orchestra. What the future may hold for him\r\nin this field (by no means so indispensable to classic repute as\r\ncertain pedants assume) it is impossible to say. In the meantime he is\r\ngiving most of his time to work in larger forms.\r\n\r\nIf in his restless hunt for novelty, always novelty, he grows too\r\noriginal, too unconventional, this sin is unusual enough to approach\r\nthe estate of a virtue. But his oddity is not mere sensation-mongering.\r\nIt is his individuality. He could make the same reply to such\r\ncriticism that Schumann made; he thinks in strange rhythms and hunts\r\ncurious effects, because his tastes are irrevocably so ordained.\r\n\r\nBut we ought to show a new genius the same generosity toward flaws\r\nthat we extend toward the masters whose fame is won beyond the\r\npatronage of our petty forgiveness. And, all in all, I am impelled to\r\nprophesy to Loomis a place very high among the inspired makers of new\r\nmusic. His harmonies, so indefatigably searched out and polished to\r\nsplendor, so potent in enlarging the color-scale of the piano; his\r\npatient building up, through long neglect and through long silence, of\r\na monumental group of works and of a distinct individuality, must\r\nprove at some late day a source of lasting pride to his country,\r\nneglectful now in spite of itself. But better than his patience, than\r\nhis courage, than his sincerity, better than that insufficient\r\ndefinition of genius,--the capacity for taking infinite pains,--is his\r\ninspired felicity. His genius is the very essence of felicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ethelbert Nevin._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ETHELBERT NEVIN.]\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to be able to chronicle the achievements of a\r\ncomposer who has become financially successful without destroying his\r\nclaim on the respect of the learned and severe, or sacrificing his own\r\nartistic conscience and individuality. Such a composer is Ethelbert\r\nNevin.\r\n\r\nHis published writings have been altogether along the smaller lines of\r\ncomposition, and he has won an enviable place as a fervent worker in\r\ndiamonds. None of his gems are paste, and a few have a perfection, a\r\nsolidity, and a fire that fit them for a place in that coronet one\r\nmight fancy made up of the richest of the jewels of the world's\r\nmusic-makers, and fashioned for the very brows of the Muse herself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Ethelbert Nevin]\r\n\r\nNevin was born in 1862, at Vineacre, on the banks of the Ohio, a few\r\nmiles from Pittsburgh. There he spent the first sixteen years of his\r\nlife, and received all his schooling, most of it from his father,\r\nRobert P. Nevin, editor and proprietor of a Pittsburgh newspaper, and\r\na contributor to many magazines. It is interesting to note that he\r\nalso composed several campaign songs, among them the popular \"Our\r\nNominee,\" used in the day of James K. Polk's candidacy. The first\r\ngrand piano ever taken across the Allegheny Mountains was carted over\r\nfor Nevin's mother.\r\n\r\nFrom his earliest infancy Nevin was musically inclined, and, at the\r\nage of four, was often taken from his cradle to play for admiring\r\nvisitors. To make up for the deficiency of his little legs, he used to\r\npile cushions on the pedals so that he might manipulate them from\r\nafar.\r\n\r\nNevin's father provided for his son both vocal and instrumental\r\ninstruction, even taking him abroad for two years of travel and music\r\nstudy in Dresden under Von Boehme. Later he studied the piano for two\r\nyears at Boston, under B.J. Lang, and composition under Stephen A.\r\nEmery, whose little primer on harmony has been to American music\r\nalmost what Webster's spelling-book was to our letters.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two years he went to Pittsburgh, where he gave lessons,\r\nand saved money enough to take him to Berlin. There he spent the\r\nyears 1884, 1885, and 1886, placing himself in the hands of Karl\r\nKlindworth. Of him Nevin says: \"To Herr Klindworth I owe everything\r\nthat has come to me in my musical life. He was a devoted teacher, and\r\nhis patience was tireless. His endeavor was not only to develop the\r\nstudent from a musical standpoint, but to enlarge his soul in every\r\nway. To do this, he tried to teach one to appreciate and to feel the\r\ninfluence of such great minds of literature as Goethe, Schiller, and\r\nShakespeare. He used to insist that a man does not become a musician\r\nby practising so many hours a day at the piano, but by absorbing an\r\ninfluence from all the arts and all the interests of life, from\r\narchitecture, painting, and even politics.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of such broad training--enjoyed rarely enough by music\r\nstudents--is very evident in Nevin's compositions. They are never\r\nnarrow or provincial. They are the outpourings of a soul that is not\r\nonly intense in its activities, but is refined and cultivated in its\r\nexpressions. This effect is seen, too, in the poems Nevin chooses to\r\nset to music,--they are almost without exception verses of literary\r\nfinish and value. His cosmopolitanism is also remarkable, his songs in\r\nFrench, German, and Italian having no trace of Yankee accent and a\r\ngreat fidelity to their several races.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, Hans von Buelow incorporated the best four pupils of his\r\nfriend, Klindworth, into an artist class, which he drilled personally.\r\nNevin was one of the honored four, and appeared at the unique public\r\n_Zuhoeren_ of that year, devoted exclusively to the works of Brahms,\r\nLiszt, and Raff. Among the forty or fifty studious listeners at these\r\nrecitals, Frau Cosima Wagner, the violinist Joachim, and many other\r\ncelebrities were frequently present.\r\n\r\nNevin returned to America in 1887, and took up his residence in\r\nBoston, where he taught and played at occasional concerts.\r\n\r\nEighteen hundred and ninety-two found him in Paris, where he taught,\r\nwinning more pupils than here. He was especially happy in imparting to\r\nsingers the proper _Auffassung_ (grasp, interpretation, finish) of\r\nsongs, and coached many American and French artists for the operatic\r\nstage. In 1893 the restless troubadour moved on to Berlin, where he\r\ndevoted himself so ardently to composition that his health collapsed,\r\nand he was exiled a year to Algiers. The early months of 1895 he\r\nspent in concert tours through this country. As Klindworth said of\r\nhim, \"he has a touch that brings tears,\" and it is in interpretation\r\nrather than in bravura that he excels. He plays with that unusual\r\ncombination of elegance and fervor that so individualizes his\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nDesirous of finding solitude and atmosphere for composition, he took\r\nup his residence in Florence, where he composed his suite, \"May in\r\nTuscany\" (op. 21). The \"Arlecchino\" of this work has much\r\nsprightliness, and shows the influence of Schumann, who made the\r\nharlequin particularly his own; but there is none of Chopin's\r\nnocturnity in the \"Notturno,\" which presents the sussurus and the\r\nmoonlit, amorous company of \"Boccaccio's Villa.\" The suite includes a\r\n\"Misericordia\" depicting a midnight cortege along the Arno, and\r\nmodelled on Chopin's funeral march in structure with its hoarse dirge\r\nand its rich cantilena. The best number of the suite is surely the\r\n\"Rusignuolo,\" an exceedingly fluty bird-song.\r\n\r\nFrom Florence, Nevin went to Venice, where he lived in an old _casa_\r\non the Grand Canal, opposite the Browning palazzo, and near the house\r\nwhere Wagner wrote \"Tristan und Isolde.\" One day his man, Guido, took\r\na day off, and brought to Venice an Italian sweetheart, who had lived\r\na few miles from the old dream-city and had never visited it. The day\r\nthese two spent gondoliering through the waterways, where romance\r\nhides in every nook, is imaginatively narrated in tone in Nevin's\r\nsuite, \"Un Giorno in Venezia,\" a book more handsomely published even\r\nthan the others of his works, which have been among the earliest to\r\nthrow off the disgraceful weeds of type and design formerly worn by\r\nnative compositions.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian suite gains a distinctly Italian color from its\r\ningenuously sweet harmonies in thirds and sixths, and its frankly\r\nlyric nature, and \"The Day in Venice\" begins logically with the dawn,\r\nwhich is ushered in with pink and stealthy harmonies, then \"The\r\nGondoliers\" have a morning mood of gaiety that makes a charming\r\ncomposition. There is a \"Canzone Amorosa\" of deep fervor, with\r\ninterjections of \"Io t'amo!\" and \"Amore\" (which has the excellent\r\nauthority of Beethoven's Sonata, op. 81, with its \"Lebe wohl\"). The\r\nsuite ends deliciously with a night scene in Venice, beginning with a\r\nchoral \"Ave Maria,\" and ending with a campanella of the utmost\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nAfter a year in Venice Nevin made Paris his home for a year,\r\nreturning to America then, where he has since remained.\r\n\r\nThough he has dabbled somewhat in orchestration, he has been wisely\r\ndevoting his genius, with an almost Chopin-like singleness of mind, to\r\nsongs and piano pieces. His piano works are what would be called\r\n_morceaux_. He has never written a sonata, or anything approaching the\r\nclassical forms, nearer than a gavotte or two. He is very modern in\r\nhis harmonies, the favorite colors on his palette being the warmer\r\nkeys, which are constantly blended enharmonically. He \"swims in a sea\r\nof tone,\" being particularly fond of those suspensions and inversions\r\nin which the intervals of the second clash passionately, strongly\r\ncompelling resolution. For all his gracefulness and lyricism, he makes\r\na sturdy and constant use of dissonance; in his song \"Herbstgefuehl\"\r\nthe dissonance is fearlessly defiant of conventions.\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n    ... Rose\r\n    Loeset lebenssatt.\r\n    Sich, das letzte lose,\r\n    Bleiche Blumenblatt.\r\n    Goldenes entfaerben,\r\n    Schleicht sich durch den Hain,\r\n    Auch vergeh'n und sterben,\r\n    Daeucht mir suess zu sein.\r\n\r\n    ... failing,\r\n    From the rose unbound,\r\n    Falls, its life exhaling,\r\n    Dead upon the ground.\r\n    Golden colors flying,\r\n    Slant from tree to tree;\r\n    Such release and dying,\r\n    Sweet would seem to me.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1889, by G. Schirmer, Jr.\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT FROM \"HERBSTGEFUeHL.\"]\r\n\r\nNevin's songs, whose only littleness is in their length, though\r\ntreated with notable individuality, are founded in principle on the\r\n_Lieder_ of Schumann and Franz. That is to say, they are written with\r\na high poetical feeling inspired by the verses they sing, and, while\r\nmelodious enough to justify them as lyrics, yet are near enough to\r\nimpassioned recitative to do justice to the words on which they are\r\nbuilt. Nevin is also an enthusiastic devotee of the position these\r\nmasters, after Schubert, took on the question of the accompaniment.\r\nThis is no longer a slavish thumping of a few chords, now and then,\r\nto keep the voice on the key, with outbursts of real expression only\r\nat the interludes; but it is a free instrumental composition with a\r\nmeaning of its own and an integral value, truly accompanying, not\r\nmerely supporting and serving, the voice. Indeed, one of Nevin's best\r\nsongs,--\"Lehn deine Wang an meine Wang,\"--is actually little more than\r\na vocal accompaniment to a piano solo. His accompaniments are always\r\nrichly colored and generally individualized with a strong\r\ncontramelody, a descending chromatic scale in octaves making an\r\nespecially frequent appearance. Design, though not classical, is\r\nalways present and distinct.\r\n\r\nNevin's first published work was a modest \"Serenade,\" with a neat\r\ntouch of syncopation, which he wrote at the age of eighteen. His\r\n\"Sketch-Book,\" a collection of thirteen songs and piano pieces found\r\nan immediate and remarkable sale that has removed the ban formerly\r\nexisting over books of native compositions.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the \"Sketch-Book\" display unusual versatility. It\r\nopens with a bright gavotte, in which adherence to the classic spirit\r\ncompels a certain reminiscence of tone. The second piece, a song, \"I'\r\nthe Wondrous Month o' May,\" has such a springtide fire and frenzy in\r\nthe turbulent accompaniment, and such a fervent reiterance, that it\r\nbecomes, in my opinion, the best of all the settings of this poem of\r\nHeine's, not excluding even Schumann's or that of Franz. The \"Love\r\nSong,\" though a piano solo, is in reality a duet between two lovers.\r\nIt is to me finer than Henselt's perfect \"Liebeslied,\" possibly\r\nbecause the ravishing sweetness of the woman's voice answering the\r\nsombre plea of the man gives it a double claim on the heart. The\r\nsetting of \"Du bist wie eine Blume,\" however, hardly does justice\r\neither to Heine's poem, or to Nevin's art. The \"Serenade\" is an\r\noriginal bit of work, but the song, \"Oh, that We Two were Maying!\"\r\nwith a voice in the accompaniment making it the duet it should\r\nbe,--that song can have no higher praise than this, that it is the\r\ncomplete, the final musical fulfilment of one of the rarest lyrics in\r\nour language. A striking contrast to the keen white regret of this\r\nsong is the setting of a group of \"Children's Songs,\" by Robert Louis\r\nStevenson. Nevin's child-songs have a peculiar and charming place. He\r\nhas not been stingy of either his abundant art or his abundant\r\nhumanity in writing them. They include four of Stevenson's, the best\r\nbeing the captivating \"In Winter I get up at Night,\" and a setting of\r\nEugene Field's \"Little Boy Blue,\" in which a trumpet figure is used\r\nwith delicate pathos.\r\n\r\nNevin's third opus included three exquisite songs of a pastoral\r\nnature, Goethe's rollicking \"One Spring Morning\" having an immense\r\nsale. Opus 5 contained five songs, of which the ecstatic \"'Twas April\"\r\nreached the largest popularity. Possibly the smallest sale was enjoyed\r\nby \"Herbstgefuehl.\" Many years have not availed to shake my allegiance\r\nto this song, as one of the noblest songs in the world's music. It is\r\nto me, in all soberness, as great as the greatest of the _Lieder_ of\r\nSchubert, Schumann or Franz. In \"Herbstgefuehl\" (or \"Autumn-mood\")\r\nGerok's superb poem bewails the death of the leaves and the failing of\r\nthe year, and cries out in sympathy:\r\n\r\n    \"Such release and dying\r\n    Sweet would seem to me!\"\r\n\r\nDeeper passion and wilder despair could not be crowded into so short a\r\nsong, and the whole brief tragedy is wrought with a grandeur and\r\nclimax positively epic. It is a flash of sheer genius.\r\n\r\nThree piano duets make up opus 6; and other charming works, songs,\r\npiano pieces, and violin solos, kept pouring from a pen whose apparent\r\nease concealed a vast deal of studious labor, until the lucky 13, the\r\nopus-number of a bundle of \"Water Scenes,\" brought Nevin the greatest\r\npopularity of all, thanks largely to \"Narcissus,\" which has been as\r\nmuch thrummed and whistled as any topical song.\r\n\r\nOf the other \"Water Scenes,\" there is a shimmering \"Dragon Fly,\" a\r\nmonody, \"Ophelia,\" with a pedal-point of two periods on the tonic, and\r\na fluent \"Barcarolle\" with a deal of high-colored virtuosity.\r\n\r\nHis book \"In Arcady\" (1892) contains pastoral scenes, notably an\r\ninfectious romp that deserves its legend, \"They danced as though they\r\nnever would grow old.\" The next year his opus 20, \"A Book of Songs,\"\r\nwas published. It contains, among other things of merit, a lullaby,\r\ncalled \"Sleep, Little Tulip,\" with a remarkably artistic and effective\r\npedal-point on two notes (the submediant and the dominant) sustained\r\nthrough the entire song with a fine fidelity to the words and the\r\nlullaby spirit; a \"Nocturne\" in which Nevin has revealed an\r\nunsuspected voluptuousness in Mr. Aldrich' little lyric, and has\r\nwritten a song of irresistible climaxes. The two songs, \"Dites-Moi\"\r\nand \"In der Nacht,\" each so completely true to the idiom of the\r\nlanguage of its poem, are typical of Nevin's cosmopolitanism, referred\r\nto before. This same unusual ability is seen in his piano pieces as\r\nwell as in his songs. He knows the difference between a _chanson_ and\r\na _Lied_, and in \"Rechte Zeit\" has written with truth to German\r\nsoldierliness as he has been sympathetic with French nuance in \"Le\r\nVase Brise,\" the effective song \"Mon Desire,\" which in profile\r\nsuggests Saint-Saens' familiar Delilah-song, the striking \"Chanson des\r\nLavandieres\" and \"Rapelle-Toi,\" one of Nevin's most elaborate works,\r\nin which Alfred De Musset's verse is splendidly set with much\r\nenharmonious color. Very Italian, too, is the \"Serenade\" with\r\naccompaniment a la mandolin, which is the most fetching number in the\r\nsuite \"Captive Memories,\" published in 1899.\r\n\r\nNevin has also put many an English song to music, notably the deeply\r\nsincere \"At Twilight,\" the strenuous lilt \"In a Bower,\" Bourdillon's\r\nbeautiful lyric, \"Before the Daybreak,\" the smooth and unhackneyed\r\ntreatment of the difficult stanza of \"'Twas April,\" that popular song,\r\n\"One Spring Morning,\" which has not yet had all the charm sung out of\r\nit, and two songs with obbligati for violin and 'cello, \"Deep in the\r\nRose's Glowing Heart\" and \"Doris,\" a song with a finely studied\r\naccompaniment and an aroma of Theokritos.\r\n\r\nA suite for the piano is \"En Passant,\" published in 1899; it ranges\r\nfrom a stately old dance, \"At Fontainebleau,\" to \"Napoli,\" a furious\r\ntarantelle with effective _glissandi_; \"In Dreamland\" is a most\r\ndelicious revery with an odd repetition that is not preludatory, but\r\nthematic. The suite ends with the most poetic scene of all, \"At Home,\"\r\nwhich makes a tone poem of Richard Hovey's word-picture of a June\r\nnight in Washington. The depicting of the Southern moonlight-balm,\r\nwith its interlude of a distant and drowsy negro quartette, reminds\r\none pleasantly of Chopin's Nocturne (op. 37, No. 1), with its\r\nintermezzo of choric monks, though the composition is Nevin's very own\r\nin spirit and treatment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the works catalogued, Nevin has written a pantomime for\r\npiano and orchestra to the libretto of that virtuoso in English, Vance\r\nThompson; it was called \"Lady Floriane's Dream,\" and was given in New\r\nYork in 1898. Nevin has also a cantata in making.\r\n\r\nIt needs no very intimate acquaintance with Nevin's music to see that\r\nit is not based on an adoration for counterpoint as an end. He\r\nbelieves that true music must come from the emotions--the intelligent\r\nemotions--and that when it cannot appeal to the emotions it has lost\r\nits power. He says: \"Above everything we need melody--melody and\r\nrhythm. Rhythm is the great thing. We have it in Nature. The trees\r\nsway, and our steps keep time, and our very souls respond.\" In\r\nWagner's \"Meistersinger,\" which he calls \"a symphonic poem with\r\naction,\" Nevin finds his musical creed and his model.\r\n\r\nAnd now, if authority is needed for all this frankly enthusiastic\r\nadmiration, let it be found in and echoed from Karl Klindworth, who\r\nsaid of Nevin: \"His talent is _ungeheures_ [one of the strongest\r\nadjectives in the German language]. If he works hard and is\r\nconscientious, he can say for the musical world something that no one\r\nelse can say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Philip Sousa._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of John Philip Sousa]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN PHILIP SOUSA.]\r\n\r\nIn common with most of those that pretend to love serious music, a\r\ncertain person was for long guilty of the pitiful snobbery of rating\r\nmarch-tunes as the lowest form of the art. But one day he joined a\r\nNational Guard regiment, and his first long march was that\r\nheart-breaking dress-parade of about fifteen miles through the wind\r\nand dust of the day Grant's monument was dedicated. Most of the music\r\nplayed by the band was merely rhythmical embroidery, chiefly in bugle\r\nfigures, as helpful as a Clementi sonatina; but now and then there\r\nwould break forth a magic elixir of tune that fairly plucked his feet\r\nup for him, put marrow in unwilling bones, and replaced the dreary\r\ndoggedness of the heart with a great zest for progress, a stout\r\nmartial fire, and a fierce _esprit de corps_; with patriotism indeed.\r\nIn almost every case, that march belonged to one John Philip Sousa.\r\n\r\nIt came upon this wretch then, that, if it is a worthy ambition in a\r\ncomposer to give voice to passionate love-ditties, or vague\r\ncontemplation, or the deep despair of a funeral cortege, it is also a\r\nvery great thing to instil courage, and furnish an inspiration that\r\nwill send men gladly, proudly, and gloriously through hardships into\r\nbattle and death. This last has been the office of the march-tune, and\r\nit is as susceptible of structural logic or embellishments as the\r\nfugue, rondo, or what not. These architectural qualities Sousa's\r\nmarches have in high degree, as any one will find that examines their\r\nscores or listens analytically. They have the further merit of\r\ndistinct individuality, and the supreme merit of founding a school.\r\n\r\nIt is only the plain truth to say that Sousa's marches have founded a\r\nschool; that he has indeed revolutionized march-music. His career\r\nresembles that of Johann Strauss in many ways. A certain body of old\r\nfogies has always presumed to deride the rapturous waltzes of\r\nStrauss, though they have won enthusiastic praise from even the\r\nesoteric Brahms, and gained from Wagner such words as these: \"One\r\nStrauss waltz overshadows, in respect to animation, finesse, and real\r\nmusical worth, most of the mechanical, borrowed, factory-made products\r\nof the present time.\" The same words might be applied to Sousa's\r\nmarches with equal justice. They have served also for dance music, and\r\nthe two-step, borne into vogue by Sousa's music, has driven the waltz\r\nalmost into desuetude.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no composer in the world with a popularity equal to\r\nthat of Sousa. Though he sold his \"Washington Post\" march outright for\r\n$35, his \"Liberty Bell\" march is said to have brought him $35,000. It\r\nis found that his music has been sold to eighteen thousand bands in\r\nthe United States alone. The amazing thing is to learn that there are\r\nso many bands in the country. Sousa's marches have appeared on\r\nprograms in all parts of the civilized world. At the Queen's Jubilee,\r\nwhen the Queen stepped forward to begin the grand review of the\r\ntroops, the combined bands of the household brigade struck up the\r\n\"Washington Post.\" On other important occasions it appeared constantly\r\nas the chief march of the week. General Miles heard the marches played\r\nin Turkey by the military bands in the reviews.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this overwhelming appeal to the hearts of a planet is\r\nnot far to seek. The music is conceived in a spirit of high martial\r\nzest. It is proud and gay and fierce, thrilled and thrilling with\r\ntriumph. Like all great music it is made up of simple elements, woven\r\ntogether by a strong personality. It is not difficult now to write\r\nsomething that sounds more or less like a Sousa march, any more than\r\nit is difficult to write parodies, serious or otherwise, on Beethoven,\r\nMozart, or Chopin. The glory of Sousa is that he was the first to\r\nwrite in this style; that he has made himself a style; that he has so\r\nstirred the musical world that countless imitations have sprung up\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nThe individuality of the Sousa march is this, that, unlike most of the\r\nother influential marches, it is not so much a musical exhortation\r\nfrom without, as a distillation of the essences of soldiering from\r\nwithin. Sousa's marches are not based upon music-room enthusiasms, but\r\non his own wide experiences of the feelings of men who march together\r\nin the open field.\r\n\r\nAnd so his band music expresses all the nuances of the military\r\npsychology: the exhilaration of the long unisonal stride, the grip on\r\nthe musket, the pride in the regimentals and the regiment,--_esprit de\r\ncorps_. He expresses the inevitable foppery of the severest soldier,\r\nthe tease and the taunt of the evolutions, the fierce wish that all\r\nthis ploying and deploying were in the face of an actual enemy, the\r\nmania to reek upon a tangible foe all the joyous energy, the\r\nblood-thirst of the warrior.\r\n\r\nThese things Sousa embodies in his music as no other music writer ever\r\nhas. To approach Sousa's work in the right mood, the music critic must\r\nleave his stuffy concert hall and his sober black; he must flee from\r\nthe press, don a uniform, and march. After his legs and spirits have\r\ngrown aweary under the metronomic tunes of others, let him note the\r\nsurge of blood in his heart and the rejuvenation of all his muscles\r\nwhen the brasses flare into a barbaric Sousa march. No man that\r\nmarches can ever feel anything but gratitude and homage for Sousa.\r\n\r\nOf course he is a trickster at times; admitted that he stoops to\r\nconquer at times, yet in his field he is supreme. He is worthy of\r\nserious consideration, because his thematic material is almost always\r\nnovel and forceful, and his instrumentation full of contrast and\r\nclimax. He is not to be judged by the piano versions of his works,\r\nbecause they are abominably thin and inadequate, and they are not\r\n_klaviermaessig_. There should be a Liszt or a Taussig to transcribe\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen all's said and done, Sousa is the pulse of the nation, and in\r\nwar of more inspiration and power to our armies than ten colonels with\r\nten braw regiments behind them.\r\n\r\nLike Strauss', Mr. Sousa's father was a musician who forbade his son\r\nto devote himself to dance music. As Strauss' mother enabled him\r\nsecretly to work out his own salvation, so did Sousa's mother help\r\nhim. Sousa's father was a political exile from Spain, and earned a\r\nprecarious livelihood by playing a trombone in the very band at\r\nWashington which later became his son's stepping-stone to fame. Sousa\r\nwas born at Washington in 1859. His mother is German, and Sousa's\r\nmusic shows the effect of Spanish yeast in sturdy German rye bread.\r\nSousa's teachers were John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. The latter\r\nMr. Sousa considers one of the most complete musicians this country\r\nhas ever known. He put him through such a thorough theoretical\r\ntraining, that at fifteen Sousa was teaching harmony. At eight he had\r\nbegun to earn his own living as a violin player at a dancing-school,\r\nand at ten he was a public soloist. At sixteen he was the conductor of\r\nan orchestra in a variety theatre. Two years later he was musical\r\ndirector of a travelling company in Mr. Milton Nobles' well-known\r\nplay, \"The Phoenix,\" for which he composed the incidental music.\r\nAmong other incidents in a career of growing importance was a position\r\nin the orchestra with which Offenbach toured this country. At the age\r\nof twenty-six, after having played, with face blacked, as a negro\r\nminstrel, after travelling with the late Matt Morgan's Living Picture\r\nCompany, and working his way through and above other such experiences\r\nin the struggle for life, Sousa became the leader of the United States\r\nMarine Band. In the twelve years of his leadership he developed this\r\nunimportant organization into one of the best military bands in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 his leadership had given him such fame that he withdrew from\r\nthe government service to take the leadership of the band carrying his\r\nown name.\r\n\r\nA work of enormous industry was his collection and arrangement, by\r\ngovernmental order, of the national and typical tunes of all nations\r\ninto one volume, an invaluable book of reference.\r\n\r\nOut of the more than two hundred published compositions by Sousa, it\r\nis not possible to mention many here. Though some of the names are not\r\nhappily chosen, they call up many episodes of parade gaiety and\r\njauntiness, or warlike fire. The \"Liberty Bell,\" \"Directorate,\" \"High\r\nSchool Cadets,\" \"King Cotton,\" \"Manhattan Beach,\" \"'Sound Off!'\"\r\n\"Washington Post,\" \"Picador,\" and others, are all stirring works; his\r\nbest, I think, is a deeply patriotic march, \"The Stars and Stripes\r\nForever.\" The second part of this has some brass work of particular\r\noriginality and vim.\r\n\r\nIn manuscript are a few works of larger form: a symphonic poem, \"The\r\nChariot Race,\" an historical scene, \"Sheridan's Ride,\" and two suites,\r\n\"Three Quotations\" and \"The Last Days of Pompeii.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Three Quotations\" are:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) \"The King of France, with twenty thousand men,\r\n          Marched up a hill and then marched down again,\"\r\n\r\nwhich is the motive for a delightful scherzo-march of much humor in\r\ninstrumentation;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) \"And I, too, was born in Arcadia,\"\r\n\r\nwhich is a pastorale with delicious touches of extreme delicacy;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) \"In Darkest Africa,\"\r\n\r\nwhich has a stunning beginning and is a stirring grotesque in the\r\nnegro manner Dvorak advised Americans to cultivate. All three are well\r\narranged for the piano.\r\n\r\nThe second suite is based on \"The Last Days of Pompeii.\" It opens with\r\na drunken revel, \"In the House of Burbo and Stratonice;\" the bulky\r\nbrutishness of the gladiators clamoring for wine, a jolly\r\ndrinking-song, and a dance by a jingling clown make up a superbly\r\nwritten number. The second movement is named \"Nydia,\" and represents\r\nthe pathetic reveries of the blind girl; it is tender and quiet\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nThe third movement is at once daring and masterly. It boldly attacks\r\n\"The Destruction,\" and attains real heights of graphic suggestion. A\r\nlong, almost inaudible roll on the drums, with occasional thuds,\r\nheralds the coming of the earthquake; subterranean rumblings, sharp\r\nrushes of tremor, toppling stones, and wild panic are insinuated\r\nvividly, with no cheap attempts at actual imitation. The roaring of\r\nthe terrified lion is heard, and, best touch of all, under the fury of\r\nthe scene persists the calm chant of the Nazarenes, written in one of\r\nthe ancient modes. The rout gives way to the sea-voyage of Glaucus and\r\nIone, and Nydia's swan-song dies away in the gentle splash of ripples.\r\nThe work is altogether one of superb imagination and scholarly\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nSousa, appealing as he does to an audience chiefly of the popular\r\nsort, makes frequent use of devices shocking to the conventional. But\r\neven in this he is impelled by the enthusiasm of an experimenter and a\r\ndeveloper. Almost every unconventional novelty is hooted at in the\r\narts. But the sensationalism of to-day is the conservatism of\r\nto-morrow, and the chief difference between a touch of high art and a\r\ntrick is that the former succeeds and the latter does not. Both are\r\nlikely to have a common origin.\r\n\r\nThe good thing is that Sousa is actuated by the spirit of progress and\r\nexperiment, and has carried on the development of the military band\r\nbegun by the late Patrick S. Gilmore. Sousa's concert programs devote\r\nwhat is in fact the greater part of their space to music by the very\r\nbest composers. These, of course, lose something in being translated\r\nover to the military band, but their effect in raising the popular\r\nstandard of musical culture cannot but be immense. Through such\r\ninstrumentality much of Wagner is as truly popular as any music\r\nplayed. The active agents of such a result should receive the\r\nheartiest support from every one sincerely interested in turning the\r\npeople toward the best things in music. Incidentally, it is well to\r\nadmit that while a cheap march-tune is almost as trashy as an\r\nuninspired symphony, a good march-tune is one of the best things in\r\nthe best music.\r\n\r\nThough chiefly known as a writer of marches, in which he has won glory\r\nenough for the average human ambition, Sousa has also taken a large\r\nplace in American comic opera. His first piece, \"The Smugglers,\" was\r\nproduced in 1879, and scored the usual failure of a first work. His\r\n\"Katherine\" was never produced, his \"Desiree\" was brought out in 1884\r\nby the McCaull Opera Company, and his \"Queen of Hearts,\" a one-act\r\npiece, was given two years later. He forsook opera then for ten years;\r\nbut in 1896 De Wolf Hopper produced his \"El Capitan\" with great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe chief tune of the piece was a march used with Meyerbeerian\r\neffectiveness to bring down the curtain. The stout verve of this \"El\r\nCapitan\" march gave it a large vogue outside the opera. Hopper next\r\nproduced \"The Charlatan,\" a work bordering upon opera comique in its\r\nfirst version. Both of these works scored even larger success in\r\nLondon than at home.\r\n\r\n[Music: Used by permission of the John Church Company, owners of the\r\ncopyright.\r\n\r\nA PAGE FROM \"EL CAPITAN,\" BY JOHN PHILIP SOUSA.]\r\n\r\nIn \"The Bride Elect,\" Sousa wrote his own libretto, and while there\r\nwas the usual stirring march as the piece de resistance, the work as a\r\nwhole was less clangorous of the cymbal than the operas of many a\r\ntamer composer. In \"Chris and the Wonderful Lamp,\" an extravaganza,\r\nthe chief ensemble was worked up from a previous march, \"Hands Across\r\nthe Sea.\"\r\n\r\nBut Sousa can write other things than marches, and his scoring is full\r\nof variety, freedom, and contrapuntal brilliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Schoenefeld._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY SCHOENEFELD.]\r\n\r\nLong before Dvorak discovered America, we aboriginals had been trying\r\nto invent a national musical dialect which should identify us as\r\ncompletely to the foreigner as our nasal intonation and our fondness\r\nfor the correct and venerable use of the word \"guess.\" But Dvorak is\r\nto credit for taking the problem off the shelf, and persuading our\r\ncomposers to think. I cannot coax myself into the enthusiasm some have\r\nfelt for Dvorak's own explorations in darkest Africa. His quartette\r\n(op. 96) and his \"New World\" symphony are about as full of accent and\r\ninfidelity as Mlle. Yvette Guilbert's picturesque efforts to sing in\r\nEnglish. But almost anything is better than the phlegm that says, \"The\r\nold ways are good enough for all time;\" and the Bohemian missionary\r\nmust always hold a place in the chronicle of American music.\r\n\r\nA disciple of Dvorak's, both in advance and in retrospect, is Henry\r\nSchoenefeld, who wrote a characteristic suite (op. 15) before the\r\nDvorakian invasion, and an overture, \"In the Sunny South,\" afterward.\r\nThe suite, which has been played frequently abroad, winning the\r\npraises of Hanslick, Nicode, and Rubinstein, is scored for string\r\norchestra. It opens with an overly reminiscent waltz-tune, and ends\r\nconventionally, but it contains a movement in negro-tone that gives it\r\nimportance. In this the strings are abetted by a tambourine, a\r\ntriangle, and a gong. It is in march-time, and, after a staccato\r\nprelude, begins with a catchy air taken by the second violins, while\r\nthe firsts, divided, fill up the chords. A slower theme follows in the\r\ntonic major; it is a jollificational air, dancing from the first\r\nviolins with a bright use of harmonics. Two periods of loud chorale\r\nappear with the gong clanging (to hint a church-bell, perhaps). The\r\nfirst two themes return and end the picture.\r\n\r\nThe overture (op. 22) has won the high esteem of A.J. Goodrich, and\r\nit seems to me to be one of the most important of native works, not\r\nbecause of its nigrescence, but because of its spontaneity therein. It\r\nadds to the usual instruments only the piccolo, the English horn, the\r\ntambourine, and triangle and cymbals. The slow introduction gives\r\nforth an original theme in the most approved and most fetching darky\r\npattern. The strings announce it, and the wood replies. The flutes and\r\nclarinets toss it in a blanket furnished by an interesting passage in\r\nthe 'cellos and contrabasses. There is a choral moment from the English\r\nhorn, the bassoons, and a clarinet. This solemn thought keeps\r\nrecurring parenthetically through the general gaiety. The first\r\nsubject clatters in, the second is even more jubilant. In the\r\ndevelopment a dance _misterioso_ is used with faithful screaming\r\nrepetitions, and the work ends regularly and brilliantly. There is\r\nmuch syncopation, though nothing that is strictly in \"rag-time;\"\r\nbanjo-figurations are freely and ingeniously employed, and the whole\r\nis a splendid fiction in local color. Schoenefeld's negroes do not\r\nspeak Bohemian.\r\n\r\nHis determined nationalism is responsible for his festival overture,\r\n\"The American Flag,\" based on his own setting of Rodman Drake's\r\nfamiliar poem. The work opens with the hymn blaring loudly from the\r\nantiphonal brass and wood. The subjects are taken from it with much\r\nthematic skill, and handled artfully, but the hymn, which appears in\r\nfull force for coda, is as trite as the most of its kith.\r\n\r\nSchoenefeld was born in Milwaukee, in 1857. His father was a musician,\r\nand his teacher for some years. At the age of seventeen Schoenefeld\r\nwent to Leipzig, where he spent three years, studying under Reinecke,\r\nCoccius, Papperitz, and Grill. A large choral and orchestral work was\r\nawarded a prize over many competitors, and performed at the Gewandhaus\r\nconcerts, the composer conducting. Thereafter he went to Weimar, where\r\nhe studied under Edward Lassen.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 he came back to America, and took up his residence in Chicago,\r\nwhere he has since lived as a teacher, orchestra leader, and composer.\r\nHe has for many years directed the Germania Maennerchor.\r\n\r\nSchoenefeld's \"Rural Symphony\" was awarded the $500 prize offered by\r\nthe National Conservatory. Dvorak was the chairman of the Committee on\r\nAward, and gave Schoenefeld hearty compliments. Later works are: \"Die\r\ndrei Indianer,\" an ode for male chorus, solo, and orchestra; a most\r\nbeautiful \"Air\" for orchestra (the air being taken by most of the\r\nstrings,--the first violins haunting the G string,--while a harp and\r\nthree flutes carry the burden of the accompaniment gracefully); a\r\npleasant \"Reverie\" for string orchestra, harp, and organ; and two\r\nimpromptus for string orchestra, a \"Meditation\" representing Cordelia\r\nbrooding tenderly over the slumbering King Lear,--art ministering very\r\ntenderly to the mood,--and a cleverly woven \"Valse Noble.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a few of Schoenefeld's works are published, all of them piano\r\npieces. It is no slur upon his orchestral glory to say that these are\r\nfor the most part unimportant, except the excellent \"Impromptu\" and\r\n\"Prelude.\" Of the eight numbers in \"The Festival,\" for children, only\r\nthe \"Mazurka\" is likely to make even the smallest child think. The\r\n\"Kleine Tanz Suite\" is better. The six children's pieces of opus 41,\r\n\"Mysteries of the Wood,\" make considerable appeal to the fancy and\r\nimagination, and are highly interesting. They show Grieg's influence\r\nvery plainly, and are quite worth recommending. This cannot be said of\r\nhis most inelegant \"Valse Elegante,\" or of his numerous dances,\r\nexcept, perhaps, his \"Valse Caprice.\"\r\n\r\nHe won in July, 1899, the prize offered to American composers by Henri\r\nMarteau, for a sonata for violin and piano. The jury was composed of\r\nsuch men as Dubois, Pierne, Diemer, and Pugno. The sonata is _quasi\r\nfantasia_, and begins strongly with an evident intention to make use\r\nof negro-tone. The first subject is so vigorously declared that one is\r\nsurprised to find that it is elastic enough to express a sweet pathos\r\nand a deep gloom. It is rather fully developed before the second\r\nsubject enters; this, on the other hand, is hardly insinuated in its\r\nrelative major before the rather inelaborate elaboration begins. In\r\nthe romanza, syncopation and imitation are much relied on, though the\r\ngeneral atmosphere is that of a nocturne, a trio of dance-like manner\r\nbreaking in. The final rondo combines a clog with a choral intermezzo.\r\nThe work is noteworthy for its deep sincerity and great lyric beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Maurice Arnold._\r\n\r\nThe plantation dances of Maurice Arnold have an intrinsic interest\r\nquite aside from their intrinsic value. Arnold, whose full name is\r\nMaurice Arnold-Strothotte, was born in St. Louis in 1865. His mother\r\nwas a prominent pianist and gave him his first lessons in music. At\r\nthe age of fifteen he went to Cincinnati, studying at the College of\r\nMusic for three years. In 1883 he went to Germany to study\r\ncounterpoint and composition with Vierling and Urban in Berlin. The\r\nlatter discouraged him when he attempted to imbue a suite with a negro\r\nplantation spirit.\r\n\r\nArnold now went upon a tramping tour in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey.\r\nSome of his compositions show the influence of his journey. He then\r\nentered the Cologne Conservatory, studying under Wuellner, Neitzel,\r\nand G. Jensen. His first piano sonata was performed there at a public\r\nconcert. He next went to Breslau, where, under the instruction of Max\r\nBruch, he wrote his cantata, \"The Wild Chase,\" and gave public\r\nperformance to other orchestral work. Returning now to St. Louis, he\r\nbusied himself as solo violinist and teacher, travelling also as a\r\nconductor of opera companies. When Dvorak came here Arnold wrote his\r\n\"Plantation Dances,\" which were produced in a concert under the\r\nauspices of the Bohemian composer. Arnold was instructor of harmony at\r\nthe National Conservatory under Dvorak.\r\n\r\nThe \"Plantation Dances\" are Arnold's thirty-third opus, and they have\r\nbeen much played by orchestras; they are also published as a piano\r\nduet; the second dance also as a solo. Arnold has not made direct use\r\nof Ethiopian themes, but has sought the African spirit. The first of\r\nthe dances is very nigresque; the second hardly at all, though it is a\r\ndelicious piece of music; the third dance uses banjo figures and\r\nrealizes darky hilarity in fine style; the fourth is a cake walk and\r\nhits off the droll humor of that pompous ceremony fascinatingly.\r\n\r\nArnold's \"Dramatic Overture\" shows a fire and rush very characteristic\r\nof him and likely to be kept up without sufficient contrast. So also\r\ndoes his cantata, \"The Wild Chase.\" Arnold has written two comic\r\noperas. I have heard parts of the first and noted moments of much\r\nbeauty and humor. The Aragonaise, which opens the third act, is\r\nparticularly delightful. The orchestration throughout displays\r\nArnold's characteristic studiousness in picturesque effect.\r\n\r\nFor piano there is a czardas, and a \"Valse Elegante\" for eight hands;\r\nit is more Viennese than Chopinesque. It might indeed be called a\r\npracticable waltz lavishly adorned. The fruits of Arnold's Oriental\r\njourney are seen in his impressionistic \"Danse de la Midway\r\nPlaisance;\" a very clever reminiscence of a Turkish minstrel; and a\r\nTurkish march, which has been played by many German orchestras. There\r\nis a \"Caprice Espagnol,\" which is delightful, and a \"Banjoenne,\" which\r\ntreats banjo music so captivatingly that Arnold may be said to have\r\ninvented a new and fertile and musical form. Besides these there are a\r\nfugue for eight hands, a \"Minstrel Serenade\" for violin and piano, and\r\nsix duets for violin and viola.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few part songs and some solos, among which mention\r\nshould be made of \"Ein Maerlein,\" in the old German style, an\r\nexquisitely tender \"Barcarolle,\" and a setting of the poem, \"I Think\r\nof Thee in Silent Night,\" which makes use of a particularly beautiful\r\nphrase for pre-, inter-, and postlude. Arnold has also written some\r\nballet music, a tarantelle for string orchestra, and is at work upon a\r\nsymphony, and a book, \"Some Points in Modern Orchestration.\" His\r\nviolin sonata (now in MS.) shows his original talent at its best. In\r\nthe first movement, the first subject is a snappy and taking example\r\nof negro-tone, the second has the perfume of moonlit magnolia in its\r\nlyricism. (In the reprise this subject, which had originally appeared\r\nin the dominant major, recurs in the tonic major, the key of the\r\nsonata being E minor.) The second movement is also in the darky\r\nspirit, but full of melancholy. For finale the composer has flown to\r\nIreland and written a bully jig full of dash and spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_N. Clifford Page._\r\n\r\nThe influence of Japanese and Chinese art upon our world of decoration\r\nhas long been realized. After considering the amount of interest shown\r\nin the Celestial music by American composers, one is tempted to\r\nprophesy a decided influence in this line, and a considerable spread\r\nof Japanese influence in the world of music also. Japanese music has a\r\ndecorative effect that is sometimes almost as captivating as in\r\npainting.\r\n\r\nThe city of San Francisco is the natural gateway for any such impulse,\r\nand not a little of it has already passed the custom house. In this\r\nfield Edgar S. Kelley's influence is predominating, and it is not\r\nsurprising that he should pass the contagion on to his pupil,\r\nNathaniel Clifford Page, who was born in San Francisco, October 26,\r\n1866. His ancestors were American for many years prior to the\r\nRevolution. He composed operas at the age of twelve, and has used many\r\nof these immature ideas with advantage in the later years. He began\r\nthe serious study of music at the age of sixteen, Kelley being his\r\nprincipal teacher. His first opera, composed and orchestrated before\r\nhe became of age, was entitled \"The First Lieutenant.\" It was produced\r\nin 1889 at the Tivoli Opera House in San Francisco, where most of the\r\ncritics spoke highly of its instrumental and Oriental color, some of\r\nthe scenes being laid in Morocco.\r\n\r\nIn instrumentation, which is considered Page's forte, he has never\r\nhad any instruction further than his own reading and investigation. He\r\nbegan to conduct in opera and concert early in life, and has had much\r\nexperience. He has also been active as a teacher in harmony and\r\norchestration.\r\n\r\nAn important phase of Page's writing has been incidental music for\r\nplays, his greatest success having been achieved by the music for the\r\n\"Moonlight Blossom,\" a play based upon Japanese life and produced in\r\nLondon in 1898. The overture was written entirely on actual Japanese\r\nthemes, including the national anthem of Japan. Page was three weeks\r\nwriting these twelve measures. He had a Japanese fiddle arranged with\r\na violin finger-board, but thanks to the highly characteristic\r\nstubbornness of orchestral players, he was compelled to have this\r\npart played by a mandolin. Two Japanese drums, a whistle used by a\r\nJapanese shampooer, and a Japanese guitar were somehow permitted to\r\nadd their accent. The national air is used in augmentation later as\r\nthe bass for a Japanese song called \"K Honen.\" The fidelity of the\r\nmusic is proved by the fact that Sir Edwin Arnold's Japanese wife\r\nrecognized the various airs and was carried away by the national\r\nanthem.\r\n\r\nAlthough the play was not a success, the music was given a cordial\r\nreception, and brought Page contracts for other work in England,\r\nincluding a play of Indian life by Mrs. Flora Annie Steel.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the writing of the \"Moonlight Blossom\" music, Page had\r\narranged the incidental music for the same author's play, \"The Cat\r\nand the Cherub.\" Edgar S. Kelley's \"Aladdin\" music was the source from\r\nwhich most of the incidental music was drawn; but Page added some\r\nthings of his own, among them being one of the most effective and\r\nunexpected devices for producing a sense of horror and dread I have\r\never listened to: simply the sounding at long intervals of two gruff\r\nsingle tones in the extreme low register of the double basses and\r\nbassoons. The grimness of this effect is indescribable.\r\n\r\nAn unnamed Oriental opera, and an opera called \"Villiers,\" in which\r\nold English color is employed (including a grotesque dance of the\r\nclumsy Ironsides), show the cosmopolitan restlessness of Page's muse.\r\nAn appalling scheme of self-amusement is seen in his \"Caprice,\" in\r\nwhich a theme of eight measures' length is instrumented with almost\r\nevery contrapuntal device known, and with psychological variety that\r\nruns through five movements, scherzando, vigoroso, con sentimento,\r\nreligioso, and a marcia fantastico. The suite called \"Village Fete\" is\r\nan experiment in French local color. It contains five scenes: The\r\nPeasants Going to Chapel; The Flower Girls; The Vagabonds; The Tryst;\r\nThe Sabot Dance; and the Entrance of the Mayor, which is a pompous\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a performance of this, Louis Arthur Russell wrote:\r\n\"His orchestra is surely French, and as modern as you please. The\r\nidiom is Berlioz's rather than Wagner's.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ACADEMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Knowles Paine._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN KNOWLES PAINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of John K. Paine]\r\n\r\nThere is one thing better than modernity,--it is immortality. So while\r\nI am a most ardent devotee of modern movements, because they are at\r\nworst experiments, and motion is necessary to life, I fail to see why\r\nit is necessary in picking up something new always to drop something\r\nold, as if one were an awkward, butter-fingered parcel-carrier.\r\n\r\nIf a composer writes empty stuff in the latest styles, he is one\r\ndegree better than the purveyor of trite stuff in the old styles; but\r\nhe is nobody before the high thinker who finds himself suited by the\r\ngeneral methods of the classic writers.\r\n\r\nThe most classic of our composers is their venerable dean, John\r\nKnowles Paine. It is an interesting proof of the youth of our native\r\nschool of music, that the principal symphony, \"Spring,\" of our first\r\ncomposer of importance, was written only twenty-one years ago. Before\r\nMr. Paine there had never been an American music writer worthy of\r\nserious consideration in the larger forms.\r\n\r\nBy a mere coincidence Joachim Raff had written a symphony called\r\n\"Spring\" in 1878, just a year before Paine finished his in America.\r\nThe first movement in both is called \"Nature's Awakening;\" such an\r\nidea is inevitable in any spring composition, from poetry up--or down.\r\nFor a second movement Raff has a wild \"Walpurgis Night Revel,\" while\r\nPaine has a scherzo called \"May Night Fantasy.\" Where Raff is uncanny\r\nand fiendish, Paine is cheerful and elfin. The third movement of\r\nRaff's symphony is called \"First Blossoms of Spring,\" and the last is\r\ncalled \"The Joys of Wandering.\" The latter two movements of Mr.\r\nPaine's symphony are \"A Promise of Spring\" and \"The Glory of Nature.\"\r\nThe beginning of both symphonies is, of course, a slow introduction\r\nrepresenting the torpid gloom of winter, out of which spring aspires\r\nand ascends.\r\n\r\nPaine's symphony, though aiming to shape the molten gold of April\r\nfervor in the rigid mold of the symphonic form, has escaped every\r\nappearance of mechanism and restraint. It is program music of the most\r\nlegitimate sort, in full accord with Beethoven's canon, \"Mehr Ausdruck\r\nder Empfindung als Malerei.\" It has no aim of imitating springtime\r\nnoises, but seeks to stimulate by suggestion the hearer's creative\r\nimagination, and provoke by a musical telepathy the emotions that\r\nswayed the nympholept composer.\r\n\r\n    The first movement of the symphony has an introduction\r\n    containing two motives distinct from the two subjects of the\r\n    movement. These motives represent Winter and the Awakening.\r\n    The Winter motive may be again divided into a chill and icy\r\n    motif and a rushing wind-motif. Through these the timid\r\n    Awakening spirit lifts its head like the first trillium of\r\n    the year. There is a silence and a stealthy flutter of the\r\n    violins as if a cloud of birds were playing courier to the\r\n    Spring.\r\n\r\n    Suddenly, after a little prelude, as if a bluebird were\r\n    tuning his throat, we are enveloped in the key of the\r\n    symphony (A major) and the Spring runs lilting up the 'cellos\r\n    to the violins (which are divided in the naif archaic\r\n    interval of the tenth, too much ignored in our over-colored\r\n    harmonies). The second subject is propounded by the oboes\r\n    (in the rather unusual related key of the submediant). This\r\n    is a lyrical and dancing idea, and it does battle with the\r\n    underground resistance of the Winter motives. There is an\r\n    elaborate conclusion of fiercest joy. Its ecstasy droops, and\r\n    after a little flutter as of little wings, the elaboration\r\n    opens with the Spring motive in the minor. In this part,\r\n    scholarship revels in its own luxury, the birds quiver about\r\n    our heads again, and the reprise begins (in A major of\r\n    course) with new exultance, the dancing second subject\r\n    appears (in the tonic), overwhelming the failing strength of\r\n    the Winter with a cascade of delight. Then the conclusion\r\n    rushes in; this I consider one of the most joyous themes ever\r\n    inspired.\r\n\r\n    There is a coda of vanishing bird-wings and throats, a\r\n    pizzicato chord on the strings--and Spring has had her\r\n    coronation.\r\n\r\n    \"The May Night Fantasy\" is a moonlit revel of elves caught by\r\n    a musical reporter, a surreptitious \"chiel amang 'em takin'\r\n    notes.\" A single hobgoblin bassoon croaks ludicrously away,\r\n    the pixies darkle and flirt and dance their hearts out of\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    The Romance is in rondo form with love-lorn iteration of\r\n    themes and intermezzo, and deftest broidery, the whole\r\n    ending, after a graceful Recollection, in a bliss of harmony.\r\n\r\n    The Finale is a halleluiah. It is on the sonata formula,\r\n    without introduction (the second subject being not in the\r\n    dominant of A major, but in C major, that chaste, frank key\r\n    which one of the popes strangely dubbed \"lascivious\"). The\r\n    elaboration is frenetic with strife, but the reprise is a\r\n    many-hued rainbow after storm, and the coda in A major\r\n    (ending a symphony begun in A minor) is swift with delight.\r\n\r\nThis symphony has been played much, but not half enough. It should\r\nresist the weariness of time as immortally as Fletcher's play, \"The\r\nTwo Noble Kinsmen\" (in which Shakespeare's hand is glorious), for it\r\nis, to quote that drama, \"fresher than May, sweeter than her gold\r\nbuttons on the bough, or all th'enamell'd knacks o' the mead or\r\ngarden.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Knowles Paine is a name that has been held in long and high\r\nhonor among American composers. He was about the earliest of native\r\nwriters to convince foreign musicians that some good could come out of\r\nNazareth.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Portland, Me., January 9, 1839. He studied music first\r\nunder a local teacher, Kotzschmar, making his debut as organist at the\r\nage of eighteen. A year later he was in Berlin, where for three years\r\nhe studied the organ, composition, instrumentation, and singing under\r\nHaupt, Wieprecht, and others. He gave several organ concerts in\r\nGermany, and made a tour in 1865-1866. In February, 1867, his \"Mass\"\r\nwas given at the Berlin Singakademie, Paine conducting. Then he came\r\nback to the States, and in 1872 was appointed to an instructorship of\r\nmusic at Harvard, whence he was promoted in 1876 to a full\r\nprofessorship, a chair created for him and occupied by him ever since\r\nwith distinguished success.\r\n\r\nHis first symphony was brought out by Theodore Thomas in 1876. This\r\nand his other orchestral works have been frequently performed at\r\nvarious places in this country and abroad.\r\n\r\nHis only oratorio, \"St. Peter,\" was first produced at Portland in\r\n1873, and in Boston a year later. It is a work of great power and much\r\ndramatic strength. Upton, in his valuable work, \"Standard Oratorios,\"\r\ncalls it \"from the highest standpoint the only oratorio yet produced\r\nin this country.\"\r\n\r\nThis oratorio, while containing much of the floridity and repetition\r\nof Haendel at his worst, is also marked with the erudition and\r\nlargeness of Haendel at his best. The aria for St. Peter, \"O God, My\r\nGod, Forsake Me Not,\" is especially fine.\r\n\r\nA much-played symphonic poem is Paine's \"The Tempest,\" which develops\r\nmusically the chief episodes of Shakespeare's play. He has also\r\nwritten a valuable overture to \"As You Like It;\" he has set Keats'\r\n\"Realm of Fancy\" exquisitely, and Milton's \"Nativity.\" And he has\r\nwritten a grand opera on a mediaeval theme to his own libretto. This is\r\na three-act work called \"Azara;\" the libretto has been published by\r\nthe Riverside Press, and is to be translated into German. This has not\r\nyet been performed. Being, unfortunately, an American grand opera, it\r\ntakes very little acuteness of foresight to predict a long wait before\r\nit is ever heard. In it Paine has shown himself more a romanticist\r\nthan a classicist, and the work is said to be full of modernity.\r\n\r\nPaine wrote the music for Whittier's \"Hymn,\" used to open the\r\nCentennial Exposition at Philadelphia, and was fitly chosen to write\r\nthe Columbus March and Hymn for the opening ceremonies of the World's\r\nFair, at Chicago, October 21, 1892. This was given by several thousand\r\nperformers under the direction of Theodore Thomas.\r\n\r\nA most original and interesting work is the chorus, \"Phoebus, Arise.\"\r\nIt seems good to hark back for words to old William Drummond \"of\r\nHawthornden.\" The exquisite flavor of long-since that marks the poetry\r\nis conserved in the tune. While markedly original, it smacks agreeably\r\nof the music of Harry Lawes, that nightingale of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, whose fancies are too much neglected nowadays.\r\n\r\nPaine's strong point is his climaxes, which are never timid, and are\r\noften positively titanic, thrilling. The climax of this chorus is\r\nnotably superb, and the voices hold for two measures after the\r\norchestra finishes. The power of this effect can be easily imagined.\r\nThis work is marked, to an unusual extent, with a sensuousness of\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThe year eighteen hundred eighty-one saw the first production of what\r\nis generally considered Paine's most important composition, and by\r\nsome called the best work by an American,--his setting of the choruses\r\nof the \"Oedipus Tyrannos\" of Sophokles. It was written for the\r\npresentation by Harvard University, and has been sung, in whole or in\r\npart, very frequently since. This masterpiece of Grecian genius is so\r\nmighty in conception and so mighty in execution that it has not lost\r\npower at all in the long centuries since it first thrilled the Greeks.\r\nTo realize its possibilities musically is to give proof enough of the\r\nvery highest order of genius,--a genius akin to that of Sophokles. It\r\nmay be said that in general Paine has completely fulfilled his\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn also set two Greek tragedies to music, Sophokles' \"Oedipus\r\nin Kolonos\" and his \"Antigone.\" Mendelssohn is reported to have made a\r\nfirst attempt at writing Grecian music, or what we suppose it to be,\r\nmainly a matter of unison and meagre instrumentation. He was soon\r\ndissuaded from such a step, however, and wisely. The Greek tragedians,\r\nreally writers of grand opera, made undoubted use of the best musical\r\nimplements and knowledge they had. Creative emotion has its\r\nprosperity in the minds of its audience, not in the accuracy of its\r\nmechanism. To secure the effect on us that the Greek tragedians\r\nproduced on contemporary audiences, it is necessary that our music be\r\na sublimation along the lines we are accustomed to, as theirs was\r\nalong lines familiar to them and effective with them. Otherwise,\r\ninstead of being moved by the miseries of Oedipus, we should be\r\nchiefly occupied with amusement at the oddity of the music, and soon\r\nbored unendurably by its monotony and thinness.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn decided then to use unison frequently for suggestion's\r\nsake, but not to carry it to a fault. His experiments along these\r\nlines have been of evident advantage to Paine, who has, however, kept\r\nstrictly to his own individuality, and produced a work that, at its\r\nhighest, reaches a higher plane, in my opinion, than anything in\r\nMendelssohn's noble tragedies,--and I am not, at that, one of those\r\nthat affect to look down upon the achievements of the genius that\r\nbuilt \"Elijah.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's prelude is an immense piece of work, in every way larger and\r\nmore elaborate than that to Mendelssohn's \"Antigone\" (the \"Oedipus\r\nin Kolonos\" begins strongly with only one period of thirteen\r\nmeasures). The opening chorus of Paine's \"Oedipus\" is the weakest\r\nthing in the work. The second strophe has a few good moments, but soon\r\nfalls back into what is impudent enough to be actually catchy!--and\r\nthat, too, of a Lowell Mason, Moody and Sankey catchiness. Curiously\r\nenough, Mendelssohn's \"Antigone\" begins with a chorus more like a\r\ndrinking-song than anything else, and the first solo is pure\r\n_Volkslied_; both of them imbued with a Teutonic flavor that could be\r\ncut with a knife. In Mendelssohn's \"Oedipus in Kolonos,\" however,\r\nthe music expresses emotion rather than German emotion, and abounds in\r\nsplendors of harmony that are strikingly Wagnerian--in advance.\r\n\r\n[Music: Copyright, 1895, by Arthur P. Schmidt.\r\n\r\nPOSTLUDE TO \"OEDIPUS TYRANNUS,\" BY J.K. PAINE.]\r\n\r\nPaine's second chorus describes the imaginary pursuit by Fate of the\r\nmurderer of King Laius. It is full of grim fire, and the second\r\nstrophe is at first simply terrible with awe. Then it degenerates\r\nsomewhat into an arioso, almost Italian. The fourth chorus defends the\r\noracles from Jocasta's incredulity. It is written almost in march\r\nmeasure, and is full of robor.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the tragedy, where it begins to transpire to\r\nOedipus that he himself was the unwitting murderer and the\r\nincestuous wretch whose exile the oracle demands before dispelling the\r\nplague,--here the divine genius of Sophokles introduces a chorus of\r\ngeneral merriment, somewhat as Shakespeare uses the maundering fool as\r\na foil to heighten King Lear's fate. No praise can be too high for\r\nPaine's music here. Its choric structure is masterly, its spirit is\r\nrunning fire. Note, as an instance, the effect at the words \"To save\r\nour land thou didst rise as a tower!\" where the music itself is\r\nsuddenly uplift with most effective suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe sixth chorus shows the effect of Oedipus' divulged guilt and the\r\nmisery of this fool of Fate. The music is an outburst of sheer genius.\r\nIt is overpowering, frightening. The postlude is orchestral, with the\r\nchorus speaking above the music. Jocasta has hanged herself, Oedipus\r\nhas torn out his own eyes with her brooch. The music is a fitting\r\nreverie on the great play, and after a wild tumult it subsides in a\r\nresigned quietude.\r\n\r\nFrom Greek tragedy to Yankee patriotism is a long cry, yet I think\r\nPaine has not wasted his abilities on his \"Song of Promise,\" written\r\nfor the Cincinnati May Festival of 1888. Though the poem by Mr. George\r\nE. Woodberry is the very apotheosis of American brag, it has a\r\nredeeming technic. The music, for soprano solo, mixed chorus, and\r\norchestra, reaches the very peaks of inspiration. I doubt if any\r\nliving composer or many dead masters could grow so epic, as most of\r\nthis. In a way it is academic. It shows a little of the influence of\r\nWagner,--as any decent music should nowadays. But it is not Wagner's\r\nmusic, and it is not trite academia. There is no finicky tinsel and no\r\ncheap oddity.\r\n\r\nConsidering the heights at which both words and music aimed, it is\r\namazing that they did not fall into utter wreck and nauseating bathos.\r\nThat they have proved so effective shows the sure-footedness of\r\ngenius. It is all good, especially the soprano solo.\r\n\r\nThis music is exquisite, wondrously exquisite, and it is followed by a\r\nmaestoso e solenne movement of unsurpassable majesty. I have never\r\nread anything more purely what music should be for grandeur. And it\r\npraises our ain countree! It might well be taken up by some of our\r\ncountless vocal societies to give a much needed respite to Haendel's\r\nthreadbare \"Messiah.\"\r\n\r\nWhen one considers the largeness of the works to which Paine has\r\ndevoted himself chiefly, he can be excused for the meagreness and\r\ncomparative unimportance of his smaller works for piano and vocal\r\nsolo. The only song of his I care for particularly is \"A Bird upon a\r\nRosy Bough\" (op. 40), which is old-fashioned, especially in\r\naccompaniment, yet at times delicious. The song \"Early Spring-time\" is\r\nmost curiously original.\r\n\r\nOf piano pieces there are a sprightly \"Birthday Impromptu\" and a fuga\r\ngiocosa, which deals wittily with that theme known generally by the\r\nwords \"Over the Fence Is Out!\" The \"Nocturne\" begins like Schumann,\r\nfalls into the style of his second Novellette, thence to the largo of\r\nBeethoven's Sonata (op. 10, No. 3), thence to Chopinism, wherein it\r\nends, an interesting assemblage withal!\r\n\r\nA long \"Romance\" for the piano is marked by some excellent incidents\r\nand much passion, but it lacks unity. It is the last work in \"An Album\r\nof Pianoforte Pieces,\" which is otherwise full of rare delights. It is\r\nmade up of opera 25, 26, and 39. Opus 25 contains four characteristic\r\npieces,--a \"Dance\" full of dance-rapture, a most original \"Impromptu,\"\r\nand a \"Rondo Giocoso,\" which is just the kind of brilliantly witty\r\nscherzo whose infrequency in American music is so lamentable and so\r\nsurprising. Opus 26 includes ten sketches, all good, especially\r\n\"Woodnotes,\" a charming tone-poem, the deliciously simple \"Wayside\r\nFlowers,\" \"Under the Lindens,\" which is a masterpiece of beautiful\r\nsyncopation, a refreshingly interesting bit in the hackneyed\r\n\"Millstream\" form, and a \"Village Dance,\" which has much of that\r\nquaint flavor that makes Heller's etudes a perennial delight.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are a number of motets, organ preludes, string\r\nquartettes, concert pieces for violin, 'cello, piano, and the like, all\r\ncontributing to the furtherance of an august fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dudley Buck._\r\n\r\nMusic follows the laws of supply and demand just as the other\r\nnecessities of life do. But before a demand could exist for it in its\r\nmore austere and unadulterated forms, the general taste for it must be\r\nimproved. For this purpose the offices of skilful compromisers were\r\nrequired, composers who could at the same time please the popular\r\ntaste and teach it discrimination. Among these invaluable workers, a\r\nhigh place belongs, in point both of priority and achievement, to\r\nDudley Buck. He has been a powerful agent, or reagent, in converting\r\nthe stagnant ferment into a live and wholesome ebullition, or as the\r\nold Greek evolutionists would say, starting the first progress in the\r\nprimeval ooze of American Philistinism.\r\n\r\nA more thoroughly New England ancestry it would be hard to find. The\r\nfounder of the family came over from England soon after the\r\n_Mayflower_ landed. Buck was named after Governor Dudley of the\r\nPlymouth Colony. He was born at Hartford, March 10, 1839. His father\r\nwas a prosperous shipping merchant, one of whose boats, during the\r\nCivil War, towed the _Monitor_ from New York to Fortress Monroe on the\r\nmomentous voyage that destroyed the _Merrimac's_ usefulness.\r\n\r\nBuck, though intended for commercial life, borrowed a work on\r\nthorough-bass and a flute and proceeded to try the wings of his muse.\r\nA melodeon supplanted the flute, and when he was sixteen he attained\r\nthe glory of a piano, a rare possession in those times. (Would that it\r\nwere rarer now!) He took a few lessons and played a church-organ for a\r\nsalary,--a small thing, but his own.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching the junior year in Trinity College, he prevailed upon\r\nhis parents to surrender him to music, an almost scandalous career in\r\nthe New England mind of that day, still unbleached of its Blue Laws.\r\n\r\nAt the age of nineteen he went to Leipzig and entered the Conservatory\r\nthere, studying composition under Hauptmann and E.F. Richter,\r\norchestration under Rietz, and the piano under Moscheles and Plaidy.\r\nLater he went to Dresden and studied the organ with Schneider.\r\n\r\nAfter three years in Germany, he studied for a year in Paris, and came\r\nhome, settling down in Hartford as church-organist and teacher. He\r\nbegan a series of organ-concert tours lasting fifteen years. He played\r\nin almost every important city and in many small towns, popularizing\r\nthe best music by that happy fervor of interpretation which alone is\r\nneeded to bring classical compositions home to the public heart. In\r\n1869 he was called to the \"mother-church\" of Chicago. In the Chicago\r\nfire he lost many valuable manuscripts, including a concert overture\r\non Drake's exquisite poem, \"The Culprit Fay,\" which must be especially\r\nregretted. He moved his family to Boston, assuming in ten days the\r\nposition of organist at St. Paul's; and later he accepted charge of\r\n\"the great organ\" at Music Hall,--that organ of which Artemus Ward\r\nwrote so deliciously.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Theodore Thomas, whose orchestra had performed many of Buck's\r\ncompositions, invited him to become his assistant conductor at the\r\nCincinnati Music Festival and at the last series of concerts at the\r\nCentral Park Garden in New York. Buck accepted and made his home in\r\nBrooklyn, where he has since remained as organist of the Holy Trinity\r\nChurch, and conductor of the Apollo Club, which he founded and brought\r\nto a high state of efficiency, writing for it many of his numerous\r\ncompositions for male voices.\r\n\r\nBuck's close association with church work has naturally led him\r\nchiefly into sacred music, and in this class of composition he is by\r\nmany authorities accorded the very highest place among American\r\ncomposers. He has also written many organ solos, sonatas, marches, a\r\npastorale, a rondo caprice, and many concert transcriptions, as well\r\nas a group of etudes for pedal phrasing, and several important\r\ntreatises on various musical topics. His two \"Motett Collections\" were\r\na refreshing relief and inspiration to church choirs thirsty for\r\nreligious Protestant music of some depth and warmth.\r\n\r\nIn the cantata form Buck also holds a foremost place. In 1876 he was\r\nhonored with a commission to set to music \"The Centennial Meditation\r\nof Columbia,\" a poem written for the occasion by the Southern poet,\r\nSidney Lanier. This was performed at the opening of the Philadelphia\r\nExhibition by a chorus of one thousand voices, an organ, and an\r\norchestra of two hundred pieces under the direction of Theodore\r\nThomas. In 1874 he made a metrical version of \"The Legend of Don\r\nMunio\" from Irving's \"Alhambra,\" and set it to music for a small\r\norchestra and chorus. Its adaptability to the resources of the vocal\r\nsocieties of smaller cities has made it one of his most popular works.\r\n\r\nAnother bit of Washington Irving is found in Buck's cantata, \"The\r\nVoyage of Columbus,\" the libretto for which he has taken from Irving's\r\n\"Life of Columbus.\" It consists of six night-scenes,--\"The Chapel of\r\nSt. George at Palos,\" \"On the Deck of the _Santa Maria_,\" \"The Vesper\r\nHymn,\" \"Mutiny,\" \"In Distant Andalusia,\" and \"Land and Thanksgiving.\"\r\nThe opportunities here for Buck's skilful handling of choruses and his\r\ndramatic feeling in solos are obvious, and the work has been\r\nfrequently used both in this country and in Germany with much success.\r\nBuck, in fact, made the German libretto as well as the English, and\r\nhas written the words for many of his compositions. His largest work\r\nwas \"The Light of Asia,\" composed in 1885 and based on Sir Edwin\r\nArnold's epic. It requires two and one-half hours for performance and\r\nhas met the usual success of Buck's music; it was produced in London\r\nwith such soloists as Nordica, Lloyd, and Santley. It has been\r\noccasionally given here.\r\n\r\nHe has found the greater part of his texts in American poetry,\r\nparticularly in Lanier, Stedman, and Longfellow, whose \"King Olaf's\r\nChristmas\" and \"Nun of Nidaros\" he has set to music, as well as his\r\n\"Golden Legend,\" which won a prize of one thousand dollars at the\r\nCincinnati Festival in a large competition. His work is analyzed very\r\nfully in A.J. Goodrich' \"Musical Analysis.\"\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n    High in the purer air,\r\n    High as the heart's desire,\r\n    In a passion of longing and fire,\r\n    A bird sings sweet and fair;\r\n    While a sunbeam, cheery and strong,\r\n    Answers the joy of the song,\r\n    And Spring, fair Spring is coming!\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1893, by G. Schirmer.\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT FROM \"SPRING'S AWAKENING,\" BY MR. BUCK.]\r\n\r\nHere, as in his symphonic overture to Scott's \"Marmion,\" Buck has\r\nadopted the Wagnerian idea of the _leit-motif_ as a vivid means of\r\ndistinguishing musically the various characters and their varying\r\nemotions. His music is not markedly Wagnerian, however, in other\r\nways, but seems to show, back of his individuality, an assimilation of\r\nthe good old school of canon and fugue, with an Italian tendency to\r\nthe declamatory and well-rounded melodic period.\r\n\r\nIt might be wished that in his occasional secular songs Buck had\r\nfollowed less in the steps of the Italian aria and the English ballad\r\nand adopted more of the newer, nobler spirit of the _Lied_ as Schumann\r\nand Franz represent it, and as many of our younger Americans have done\r\nwith thorough success and not a little of exaltation. Note for\r\ninstance the inadequacy of the old-style balladry to both its own\r\nopportunity and the otherwise-smothered fire of such a poem as Sidney\r\nLanier's \"Sunset,\" which is positively Shakespearean in its passionate\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nIn religious music, however, Mr. Buck has made a niche of its own for\r\nhis music, which it occupies with grace and dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Horatio W. Parker._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Horatio W. Parker]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORATIO W. PARKER.]\r\n\r\nWhen one considers the enormous space occupied by the hymn-tune in New\r\nEngland musical activity, it is small wonder that most of its\r\ncomposers should display hymnal proclivities. Both Buck and Parker\r\nare natives of New England.\r\n\r\nParker was born, September 15, 1863, at Auburndale, Mass. His mother\r\nwas his first teacher of music. She was an organist, and gave him a\r\nthorough technical schooling which won the highest commendation later\r\nfrom Rheinberger, who entrusted to him the first performance of a new\r\norgan concerto. After some study in Boston under Stephen A. Emery,\r\nJohn Orth, and G.W. Chadwick, Parker went to Munich at the age of\r\neighteen, where he came under the special favor of Rheinberger, and\r\nwhere various compositions were performed by the Royal Music School\r\norchestra. After three years of Europe, he returned to America and\r\nassumed the direction of the music at St. Paul's school. He has held\r\nvarious posts since, and has been, since 1894, the Battell Professor\r\nof Music at Yale.\r\n\r\nHis rather imposing list of works includes a symphony (1885), an\r\noperetta, a concert overture (1884), an overture, \"Regulus\" (1885),\r\nperformed in Munich and in London, and an overture, \"Count Robert of\r\nParis\" (1890), performed in New York, a ballad for chorus and\r\norchestra, \"King Trojan,\" presented in Munich in 1885, the\r\nTwenty-third Psalm for female chorus and orchestra (1884), an \"Idylle\"\r\n(1891); \"The Normans,\" \"The Kobolds,\" and \"Harold Harfager,\" all for\r\nchorus and orchestra, and all dated 1891; an oratorio, three or more\r\ncantatas, and various bits of chamber-music. His opus number has\r\nalready reached forty-three, and it is eked out to a very small degree\r\nby such imponderous works as organ and piano solos, hymns, and songs.\r\nIn 1893, Parker won the National Conservatory prize for a cantata, and\r\nin 1898 the McCagg prize for an a cappella chorus.\r\n\r\nParker's piano compositions and secular songs are not numerous. They\r\nseem rather the incidental byplays and recreations of a fanry chiefly\r\nturned to sacred music of the larger forms.\r\n\r\nOpus 19 consists of \"Four Sketches,\" of which the \"Etude Melodieuse\"\r\nis as good as is necessary in that overworked style, wherein a thin\r\nmelody is set about with a thinner ripple of arpeggios. The \"Romanza\"\r\nis lyric and delightful, while the \"Scherzino\" is delicious and crisp\r\nas celery; it is worthy of Schumann, whom it suggests, and many of\r\nwhose cool tones and mannerisms it borrows.\r\n\r\nThe \"5 Morceaux Characteristiques\" are on the whole better. The\r\n\"Scherzo\" is shimmering with playfulness, and, in the Beethoven\r\nfashion, has a tender intermezzo amoroso. This seriousness is enforced\r\nwith an ending of a most plaintive nature. The \"Caprice\" is brilliant\r\nand whimsical, with some odd effects in accent. The \"Gavotte\" makes\r\nunusual employment of triplets, but lacks the precious yeast of\r\nenthusiasm necessary to a prime gavotte.\r\n\r\nThis enthusiasm is not lacking however from his \"Impromptu,\" and it\r\nmakes his \"Elegie\" a masterly work, possibly his best in the smaller\r\nlines. This piece is altogether elegiac in spirit, intense in its\r\nsombrest depths, impatient with wild outcries,--like Chopin's \"Funeral\r\nMarch,\"--and working up to an immense passion at the end. This\r\nsubsides in ravishingly liquid arpeggios,--\"melodious tears\"?--which\r\nobtain the kindred effect of Chopin's tinkling \"Berceuse\" in a\r\nslightly different way. This notable work is marred by an interlude in\r\nwhich the left hand mumbles harshness in the bass, while the right\r\nhand is busy with airy fioriture. It is too close a copy of the finish\r\nof the first movement of Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" sonata. The\r\nlengthening skips of the left hand are also Beethovenesque trademarks.\r\n\r\nParker is rather old-fashioned in his forms of musical speech. That\r\nis, he has what you might call the narrative style. He follows his\r\ntheme as an absorbing plot, engaging enough in itself, without\r\ngorgeous digressions and pendent pictures. His work has something of\r\nthe Italian method. A melody or a theme, he seems to think, is only\r\nmarred by abstruse harmony, and is endangered by diversions. One might\r\nalmost say that a uniform lack of attention to color-possibilities and\r\na monotonous fidelity to a cool, gray tone characterize him. His\r\nfondness for the plain, cold octave is notable. It is emphasized by\r\nthe ill-success of his \"Six Lyrics for Piano, without octaves.\" They\r\nare all of thin value, and the \"Novelette\" is dangerously\r\nSchumannesque.\r\n\r\nThe \"Three Love Songs\" are happy, \"Love's Chase\" keeping up the arch\r\nraillery and whim of Beddoe's verse. \"Orsame's Song\" is smooth and\r\ngraceful, ending with a well-blurted, abrupt \"The devil take her!\" The\r\n\"Night-piece to Julia\" is notable. We have no poet whose lyrics are\r\nharder to set to music than good Robin Herrick's. They have a lilt of\r\ntheir own that is incompatible with ordinary music. Parker has,\r\nhowever, been completely successful in this instance. A mysterious,\r\nnight-like carillon accompaniment, delicate as harebells, gives sudden\r\nway to a superb support of a powerful outburst at the end of the song.\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n    The stars of the night\r\n    Will lend thee their light,\r\n    Like tapers without number.\r\n    Then, Julia let me woo thee,\r\n    Thus to come unto me;\r\n    And when I shall meet\r\n    Thy silvery feet\r\n    My soul I'll pour into thee,\r\n    My soul I'll pour into thee, into thee.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1886, by Arthur P. Schmidt & Co.\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF MR. PARKER'S SONG, \"NIGHT-PIECE TO JULIA.\"]\r\n\r\nThe \"Six Songs\" show not a little of that modernity and opulent color\r\nI have denied to the most of Mr. Parker's work. \"Oh, Ask Me Not\" is\r\nnothing less than inspiration, rapturously beautiful, with a rich use\r\nof unexpected intervals. The \"Egyptian Serenade\" is both novel and\r\nbeautiful. The other songs are good; even the comic-operatic flavor of\r\nthe \"Cavalry Song\" is redeemed by its catchy sweep.\r\n\r\nAmong a large number of works for the pipe-organ, few are so marked by\r\nthat purposeless rambling organists are so prone to, as the\r\n\"Fantaisie.\" The \"Melody and Intermezzo\" of opus 20 makes a sprightly\r\nhumoresque. The \"Andante Religioso\" of opus 17 has really an\r\nallegretto effect, and is much better as a gay pastorale than as a\r\ndevotional exercise. It is much more shepherdly than the avowed\r\n\"Pastorale\" (opus 20), and almost as much so as the \"Eclogue,\"\r\ndelicious with the organ's possibilities for reed and pipe effects.\r\nThe \"Romanza\" is a gem of the first water. A charming quaint effect\r\nis got by the accompaniment of the air, played legato on the swell,\r\nwith an echo, staccato, of its own chords on the great. The interlude\r\nis a tender melody, beautifully managed. The two \"Concert Pieces\" are\r\nmarked by a large simplicity in treatment, and have this rare merit,\r\nthat they are less gymnastic exercises than expressions of feeling. A\r\nfiery \"Triumphal March,\" a delightful \"Canzonetta,\" and a noble\r\n\"Larghetto,\" of sombre, yet rich and well-modulated, colors, complete\r\nthe list of his works for the organ. None of these are registered with\r\nover-elaboration.\r\n\r\nTo sacred music Parker has made important contributions. Besides a\r\ndignified, yet impassioned, complete \"Morning and Evening Service for\r\nthe Holy Communion,\" he has written several single songs and anthems.\r\n\r\nIt is the masterwork, \"Hora Novissima,\" however, which lifts him above\r\ngolden mediocrity. From the three thousand lines of Bernard of Cluny's\r\npoem, \"De Contemptu Mundi,\" famous since the twelfth century, and made\r\nmusic with the mellowness of its own Latin rhyme, Mrs. Isabella G.\r\nParker, the composer's mother, has translated 210 lines. The English\r\nis hardly more than a loose paraphrase, as this random parallel\r\nproves:\r\n\r\n    Pars mea, Rex meus,    Most Mighty, most Holy,\r\n    In proprio Deus,       How great is the glory,\r\n      Ipse decore.           Thy throne enfolding.\r\n\r\nOr this skilful evasion:\r\n\r\n    Tunc Jacob, Israel,    All the long history,\r\n    Et Lia, tunc Rachel    All the deep mystery\r\n      Efficietur.            Through ages hidden.\r\n\r\nBut it is perhaps better for avoiding the Charybdis of literalness.\r\n\r\nThose who accuse Rossini's \"Stabat Mater\" of a fervor more theatric\r\nthan religious, will find the same faults in Parker's work, along with\r\nmuch that is purely ecclesiastical. Though his sorrow is apt to become\r\npetulance, there is much that is as big in spirit as in handling. The\r\nwork is frequently Mendelssohnian in treatment. An archaism that might\r\nhave been spared, since so little of the poem was retained, is the sad\r\nold Haendelian style of repeating the same words indefinitely, to all\r\nneglect of emptiness of meaning and triteness. Thus the words \"_Pars\r\nmea, Rex meus_\" are repeated by the alto exactly thirteen times!\r\nwhich, any one will admit, is an unlucky number, especially since the\r\nother voices keep tossing the same unlucky words in a musical\r\nbattledore.\r\n\r\nThe especially good numbers of the work (which was composed in 1892,\r\nand first produced, with almost sensational success, in 1893) are: the\r\nmagnificent opening chorus; the solo for the soprano; the large and\r\nfiery finale to Part I.; the superb tenor solo, \"Golden Jerusalem,\"\r\nwhich is possibly the most original and thrilling of all the numbers,\r\nis, in every way, well varied, elaborated, and intensified, and\r\nprepares well for the massive and effective double chorus, \"Stant Syon\r\nAtria,\" an imposing structure whose ambition found skill sufficing; an\r\nalto solo of original qualities; and a finale, tremendous, though\r\nsomewhat long drawn out. Of this work, so careful a critic as W.J.\r\nHenderson was moved to write:\r\n\r\n    \"His melodic ideas are not only plentiful, but they are\r\n    beautiful, ... graceful and sometimes splendidly vigorous....\r\n    There is an a cappella chorus which is one of the finest\r\n    specimens of pure church polyphony that has been produced in\r\n    recent years.... It might have been written by Hobrecht,\r\n    Brumel, or even Josquin des Pres. It is impossible to write\r\n    higher praise than this.... The orchestration is\r\n    extraordinarily ... rich. As a whole ... the composition\r\n    ... may be set down as one of the finest achievements of the\r\n    present day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Philip Hale, a most discriminant musical enthusiast, described the\r\nchorus \"Pars Mea\" as:\r\n\r\n    \"A masterpiece, true music of the church,\" to which \"any\r\n    acknowledged master of composition in Europe would gladly\r\n    sign his name.... For the a cappella chorus there is nothing\r\n    but unbounded praise.... Weighing words as counters, I do not\r\n    hesitate to say that I know of no one in the country or in\r\n    England who could by nature and by student's sweat have\r\n    written those eleven pages.... I have spoken of Mr. Parker's\r\n    quasi-operatic tendency. Now he is a modern. He has shown in\r\n    this very work his appreciation and his mastery of antique\r\n    religious musical art. But as a modern he is compelled to\r\n    feel the force of the dramatic in religious music.... But his\r\n    most far-reaching, his most exalted and rapt conception of\r\n    the bliss beyond compare is expressed in the language of\r\n    Palestrina and Bach.\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1899, the work was produced with decisive success in\r\nLondon, Parker conducting.\r\n\r\nBesides this, there are several secular cantatas, particularly \"King\r\nTrojan,\" which contains a singable tune for Trojan with many delicate\r\nnuances in the accompaniment, and a harp-accompanied page's song that\r\nis simply ambrosial. Then there is Arlo Bates' poem, \"The Kobolds,\"\r\nwhich Parker has blessed with music as delicate as the laces of\r\ngossamer-spiders.\r\n\r\nHis latest work is devoted to the legend of St. Christopher, and\r\ndisplays the same abilities for massive and complex scoring whenever\r\nthe opportunity offers. On the other hand, the work discloses Parker's\r\nweaknesses as well, for the libretto drags in certain love episodes\r\nevidently thought desirable for the sake of contrast and yet\r\nmanifestly unnecessary to the story. The character of the queen, for\r\ninstance, is quite useless, and, in fact, disconcerting. The love\r\nscene between the king and queen reminds one uncomfortably of Tristan\r\nand Isolde, while a descending scale constantly used throughout the\r\nwork in the accompaniment incessantly suggests the \"Samson and\r\nDelilah\" of Saint-Saens.\r\n\r\nIn spite of flaws, however,--flaws are to be had everywhere for the\r\nlooking,--Parker's work has its fine points. The struggle between the\r\ndemons and the singers of the sacred Latin Hymn has made excellent use\r\nof the Tannhaeuser effect. The Cathedral scene shows Parker's resources\r\nin the massive use of choruses to be very large. The barcarolling\r\nbillows of the river are ravishingly written, and the voice of the\r\nchild crying out is effectively introduced. The song the giant\r\nChristopher sings through the storm is particularly superb.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank van der Stucken._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANK VAN DER STUCKEN.]\r\n\r\nOn the bead-roll of those who have had both the ability and the\r\ncourage to take a stand for our music, the name of Frank van der\r\nStucken must stand high. His Americanism is very frail, so far as\r\nbirth and breeding count, but he has won his naturalization by his\r\nardor for native music.\r\n\r\nVan der Stucken's life has been full of labors and honors. He was born\r\nat Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1858, of a Belgian father and a German\r\nmother. After the Civil War, in which the father served in the\r\nConfederate army as a captain of the Texan cavalry, the family\r\nreturned to Belgium, where, at Antwerp, Van der Stucken studied under\r\nBenoit. Here some of his music was played in the churches, and a\r\nballet at the Royal Theatre.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 he began studies in Leipzig, making important acquaintances,\r\nsuch as Reinecke, Grieg, and Sinding. His first male chorus was sung\r\nthere, with great success. Of his fifth opus, consisting of nine\r\nsongs, Edvard Grieg wrote an enthusiastic criticism. After travelling\r\nfor some time, Van der Stucken was appointed kapellmeister at the\r\nBreslau Stadt-Theatre. This was his debut as conductor. Here he\r\ncomposed his well-known suite on Shakespeare's \"Tempest,\" which has\r\nbeen performed abroad and here. Here, also, he wrote a \"Festzug,\" an\r\nimportant work in Wagnerian style, and his passionate \"Pagina\r\nd'Amore,\" which, with the published portions of his lyric drama,\r\n\"Vlasda,\" has been performed by many great orchestras.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, Van der Stucken met Liszt, at Weimar, and under his auspices\r\ngave a concert of his own compositions, winning the congratulations of\r\nGrieg, Lassen, Liszt, and many other celebrated musicians. A prominent\r\nGerman critic headed his review of the performance: \"A new star on the\r\nmusical firmament.\"\r\n\r\nVan der Stucken was now called to the directorship of the famous Arion\r\nMale Chorus in New York, a position which he held for eleven years\r\nwith remarkable results. In 1892 he took his chorus on a tour in\r\nEurope and won superlative praises everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 and successive years Van der Stucken conducted orchestral\r\n\"Novelty Concerts,\" which have an historical importance as giving the\r\nfirst hearing to symphonic works by American composers. In Berlin and\r\nin Paris he also gave our musicians the privilege of public\r\nperformance. From 1891 to 1894 he devoted himself to reforming the\r\nNortheastern Saeengerbund, achieving the enormous task of making five\r\nthousand male voices sing difficult music artistically. Since 1895 Van\r\nder Stucken has been conductor of the newly formed Cincinnati Symphony\r\nOrchestra, as well as dean of the faculty of the College of Music in\r\nthat city. The influence of this man, who is certainly one of the most\r\nimportant musicians of his time, is bringing Cincinnati back to its\r\nold musical prestige.\r\n\r\nAs a composer, Van der Stucken shows the same originality and power\r\nthat characterize him as an organizer. His prelude to the opera\r\n\"Vlasda\" (op. 9) is one long rapture of passionate sweetness, superbly\r\ninstrumented. An arrangement of it has been made for the piano for\r\nfour hands by Horatio W. Parker.\r\n\r\nVan der Stucken's music to \"The Tempest\" (op. 8) is published in three\r\nforms. Besides the orchestral score, there is an arrangement for piano\r\nsolo, by A. Siloti, of the \"Dance of the Gnomes,\" \"Dance of the\r\nNymphs,\" and \"Dance of the Reapers,\" the first and third being\r\nespecially well transcribed. For four hands, Hans Sitt has arranged\r\nthese three dances, as well as a short but rich \"Exorcism,\" some\r\nsplendid melodramatic music, and the rattling grotesque, \"The\r\nHound-chase after Caliban.\" All these pieces are finely imagined and\r\nartistically handled.\r\n\r\nFor piano solo, there is a group of three Miniatures (op. 7). The\r\nfirst is an Albumblatt of curious dun colors; the second is a\r\nCapriccietto, a strange whim; the third is a beautiful bit called \"May\r\nBlossom.\"\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n    Der Stunde sei geflucht,\r\n    wo ich dein Herz gesucht,\r\n    wenn in dir diese Liebe\r\n    statt milder Freudentriebe\r\n    soll tragen herbe Frucht!\r\n    Gesegnet ist die Stunde,\r\n    sprach sie mit suessem Munde,\r\n    mir ist kein Leid geschehn\r\n    den Himmel fuehl' ich stehn\r\n    in meines Herzens Grunde.\r\n\r\n    That hour with curse be fraught,\r\n    In which thy heart I sought,\r\n    If I, in love bestowing,\r\n    Instead of gladness knowing,\r\n    A bitter grief have bought:\r\n    \"My soul that hour e'er blesses,\"\r\n    A rosy mouth confesses,\r\n    \"Thy love is all I crave,\r\n    Then heav'n itself I have\r\n    Within my heart's recesses.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1892, by Friedrich Luckhardt, Berlin.\r\n\r\nBy permission of Luckhardt & Belder, New York.\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF MR. VAN DER STUCKEN'S \"DIE STUNDE SEI GESEGNET.\"]\r\n\r\nOf Van der Stucken's songs I have seen two groups, the first a setting\r\nof five love lyrics by Rueckert. None of these are over two pages long,\r\nexcept the last. They are written in the best modern _Lied_ style, and\r\nare quite unhackneyed. It is always the unexpected that happens,\r\nthough this unexpected thing almost always proves to be a right thing.\r\nWithout any sense of strain or bombast he reaches superb climaxes;\r\nwithout eccentricity he is individual; and his songs are truly\r\ninterpreters of the words they express. Of these five, \"Wann die Rosen\r\naufgeblueht\" is a wonderfully fine and fiery work; \"Die Stunde sei\r\ngesegnet\" has one of the most beautiful endings imaginable; \"Mir ist,\r\nnun ich die habe\" has a deep significance in much simplicity, and its\r\nending, by breaking the rule against consecutive octaves, attains, as\r\nrule-breakings have an unpleasant habit of doing, an excellent effect.\r\n\"Liebste, nur dich seh'n\" is a passionate lyric; and \"Wenn die\r\nVoeglein sich gepaart\" is florid and trilly, but legitimately so; it\r\nshould find much concert use. These songs, indeed, are all more than\r\nmelodies; they are expressions.\r\n\r\nOf the second group of eight songs for low voice, \"O Jugendlust\" is\r\nathrill with young ecstasy; \"Einsame Thraene\" has superb coloring, all\r\nsombre, and a tremendous climax; \"Seeligkeit\" is big with emotion and\r\nravishing in harmony, \"Ein Schaeferlied\" is exquisite, \"Von schoen\r\nSicilien war mein Traum\" begins in the style of Lassen, but ends with\r\na strength and vigor far beyond that tender melodist. Besides these\r\ngroups, there is a rich lyric \"Moonlight;\" and there are many part\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\nA work of considerable importance written many years before and\r\npresented by Franz Liszt at Weimar had its first American production\r\nin 1899, at Cincinnati and New York. It is a symphonic prologue to\r\nHeine's tragedy, \"William Ratcliff.\" The different psychological\r\nphases of the tragedy are presented by characteristic motives which\r\nwar among themselves. The Scottish locale is indicated vividly, and\r\nthe despair of the lovers presented in one place by the distortion and\r\nrending of all the principal motives. A dirge with bells and a final\r\nmusing upon, and resignation before, implacable Fate give a dignified\r\nclose to a work in which passion is exploited with erudition and\r\nmodernity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_W.W. Gilchrist._\r\n\r\nThe prize competition has its evils, unquestionably; and, in a place\r\nof settled status, perhaps, they outnumber its benefits. But in\r\nAmerican music it has been of material encouragement to the production\r\nof large works. In the first place, those who do not win have been\r\nstimulated to action, and have at least their effort for their pains.\r\nIn the second place, those who manage to win are several hundred\r\ndollars the richer, and may offer the wolf at the door a more\r\neffective bribe than empty-stomached song.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Philadelphia lives a composer of unusual luck in\r\nprize-winning. That large and ancient town is not noteworthy for its\r\nactivity in the manufacture of original music. In fact, some one has\r\nspoken of it as \"a town where the greatest reproach to a musician is\r\nresidence there.\" The city's one prominent music-writer is William\r\nWallace Gilchrist; but he stands among the first of our composers. He\r\nis especially interesting as a purely native product, having never\r\nstudied abroad, and yet having won among our composers a foremost\r\nplace in the larger forms of composition. He was born in Jersey City,\r\nJanuary 8, 1846; his father was a Canadian, his mother a native of\r\nthis country; both were skilled in music, and his home life was full\r\nof it, especially of the old church music. After a youth of the usual\r\nschool life he tried various pursuits,--photography, law, business;\r\nbut music kept calling him. A good barytone voice led him to join\r\nvocal societies, and at length he made music his profession, after\r\nstudying voice, organ, and composition with Dr. H.A. Clarke, of\r\nPhiladelphia. He was a successful soloist in oratorio for some years,\r\nbut gradually devoted himself to church work and conducting, and to\r\ncomposition, though none of his music was published till he was\r\nthirty-two, when he took two prizes offered by the Abt Male Singing\r\nSociety of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nShortly after taking the Abt Society prize, he won three offered by\r\nthe Mendelssohn Glee Club of New York, and in 1884 he took the $1,000\r\nprize offered by the Cincinnati Festival Association.\r\n\r\nThis last was gained by his setting of the Forty-sixth Psalm for\r\nsoprano solo, chorus, and orchestra. The overture opens with a noble\r\nandante contemplatif, which deserves its epithet, but falls after a\r\ntime into rather uninteresting moods, whence it breaks only at the\r\nlast period. The opening chorus, \"God Is Our Refuge and Strength,\"\r\nseems to me to be built on a rather trite and empty subject, which it\r\nplays battledore and shuttlecock with in the brave old pompous and\r\ncanonic style, which stands for little beyond science and labor. It is\r\nonly fair to say, however, that A.J. Goodrich, in his \"Musical\r\nAnalysis,\" praises \"the strength and dignity\" of this chorus; and\r\ngives a minute analysis of the whole work with liberal thematic\r\nquotation. The psalm, as a whole, though built on old lines, is built\r\nwell on those lines, and the solo \"God Is in the Midst of Her\" is\r\ntaken up with especially fine effect by the chorus. \"The Heathen\r\nRaged\" is a most ingeniously complicated chorus also.\r\n\r\nThe cantata, \"Prayer and Praise,\" is similarly conventional, and\r\nsuffers from the sin of repetition, but contains much that is strong.\r\n\r\nOf the three prize male choruses written for the Mendelssohn Glee\r\nClub, the \"Ode to the Sun\" is the least successful. It is written to\r\nthe bombast of Mrs. Hemans, and is fittingly hysterical; occasionally\r\nit fairly shrieks itself out. \"In Autumn\" is quieter; a sombre work\r\nwith a fine outburst at the end. \"The Journey of Life\" is an andante\r\nmisterioso that catches the gloom of Bryant's verse, and offers a good\r\nplay for that art of interweaving voices in which Gilchrist is an\r\nadept.\r\n\r\n\"The Uplifted Gates\" is a chorus for mixed voices with solos for\r\nsopranos and altos; it is elaborate, warm, and brilliant. In lighter\r\ntone are the \"Spring Song,\" a trio with cheap words, but bright music\r\nand a rich ending, and \"The Sea Fairies,\" a chorus of delightful\r\ndelicacy for women's voices. It has a piano accompaniment for four\r\nhands. In this same difficult medium of women's voices is \"The\r\nFountain,\" a surpassingly beautiful work, graceful and silvery as a\r\ncascade. It reminds one, not by its manner at all, but by its success,\r\nof that supreme achievement, Wagner's song of the \"Rhinemaidens.\"\r\nThe piano accompaniment to Gilchrist's chorus aids the general\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nA thoroughly charming work is the setting of Lowell's poem, \"The\r\nRose,\" for solos and chorus. The dreariness of the lonely poet and the\r\nlonely maid contrasts strongly with the rapture of their meeting. As\r\nthe first half of the poem is morose yet melodious, the latter is\r\nbright with ecstasy; the ending is of the deepest tenderness.\r\n\r\nBy all odds the best of these choruses, however, is \"The Legend of the\r\nBended Bow,\" a fine war-chant by Mrs. Hemans. Tradition tells that in\r\nancient Britain the people were summoned to war by messengers who\r\ncarried a bended bow; the poem tells of the various patriots\r\napproached. The reaper is bidden to leave his standing corn, the\r\nhuntsman to turn from the chase; the chieftain, the prince, mothers,\r\nsisters, sweethearts, and the bards are all approached and counselled\r\nto bravery. After each episode follow the words \"And the bow passed\r\non,\" but the music has been so well managed that the danger of such a\r\nrepetition is turned into grim force. The only prelude is five great\r\nblasts of the horns. A brawny vigor is got by a frequent use of\r\nimitation and unison in the voices. The choric work is marked\r\nthroughout with the most intense and epic power, almost savagery; a\r\nmagnificent martial zest. The climax is big. It is certainly one of\r\nthe best things of its kind ever done over here.\r\n\r\nAnother work of fine quality throughout is \"A Christmas Idyl,\" for\r\nsolos, chorus, and orchestra. A terrible sombreness is achieved in its\r\nformer half by a notable simplicity. The latter part is in brighter\r\ntone; the solo, \"And Thou, Bethlehem,\" is especially exultant. In\r\nmanuscript is \"An Easter Idyl,\" of large proportions, for solos,\r\nchorus, and orchestra, or organ.\r\n\r\nIn the single songs the influence of Gilchrist's early training in\r\nhymns is patent. In only a few instances do they follow the latter-day\r\nmethods of Schumann and Franz. \"A Song of Doubt and a Song of Faith\"\r\nis possibly his best vocal solo. It begins with a plaint, that is full\r\nof cynic despair; thence it breaks suddenly into a cheerful andante.\r\n\"The Two Villages\" is a strong piece of work on the conventional\r\nlines of what might be called the Sunday ballad. \"A Dirge for Summer\"\r\nhas a marked originality, and is of that deep brooding which is\r\nparticularly congenial to Gilchrist's muse. The Scotch songs are\r\ncharming: \"My Heart is Sair\" is full of fine feeling, and must be\r\nclassed among the very best of the many settings of this lyric of\r\nBurns'.\r\n\r\nMost modern in feeling of all Gilchrist's vocal solos is the group of\r\n\"Eight Songs.\" They interpret the text faithfully and the\r\naccompaniment is in accord with the song, but yet possessed of its own\r\nindividuality. \"A Love Song\" is tender and has a well-woven\r\naccompaniment; \"The Voice of the Sea\" is effective, but hardly attains\r\nthe large simplicity of Aldrich' poem; \"Autumn\" is exquisitely cheery;\r\n\"Goldenrod\" is ornately graceful, while \"The Dear Long Ago\" is quaint;\r\n\"Lullaby\" is of an exquisitely novel rhythm in this overworked form.\r\n\r\n[Music: A LOVE SONG.\r\n\r\nBy Barry Cornwall.\r\n\r\nMusic by W.W. Gilchrist.\r\n\r\n    Love me if I live,\r\n    Love me if I die.\r\n    What to me is life or death,\r\n    So that thou, that thou be near.\r\n    What to me is life or death,\r\n    So that thou be near,\r\n    So that thou be near.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1885, by Arthur P. Schmidt & Co.\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT.]\r\n\r\nThere is much contrast between the lightness of his book, \"Songs for\r\nthe Children,\" and his ponderous setting of Kipling's \"Recessional.\"\r\nThe treatment of Paul Laurence Dunbar's \"Southern Lullaby\" is unusual,\r\nand the songs, \"My Ladye\" and \"The Ideal,\" both in MS., are\r\nnoteworthy.\r\n\r\nGilchrist has written a vast amount of religious music, including\r\nseveral \"Te Deums,\" of which the one in C and that in A flat are the\r\nbest, to my thinking. He has written little for the piano except a\r\nseries of duets, of which the charming \"Melodie\" and the fetching\r\n\"Styrienne\" are the best.\r\n\r\nIt is by his orchestral works, however, that he gains the highest\r\nconsideration. These include a symphony for full orchestra, which has\r\nbeen frequently performed with success; a suite for orchestra; a suite\r\nfor piano and orchestra; as well as a nonet, a quintet, and a trio,\r\nfor strings and wind. None of these have been published, but I have\r\nhad the privilege of examining some of the manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe spirit and the treatment of these works is strongly classical.\r\nWhile the orchestration is scholarly and mellow, it is not in the\r\nleast Wagnerian, either in manipulation or in lusciousness. The\r\nsymphony is not at all programmatic. The Scherzo is of most exuberant\r\ngaiety. Its accentuation is much like that in Beethoven's piano\r\nsonata (op. 14, No. 2). Imitation is liberally used in the scoring,\r\nwith a delightfully comic effect as of an altercation. The symphony\r\nends with a dashing finale that is stormy with cheer. Gilchrist is at\r\nwork upon a second symphony of more modernity.\r\n\r\nThe \"Nonet\" is in G minor, and begins with an Allegro in which a most\r\noriginal and severe subject is developed with infinite grace and\r\nan unusually rich color. The Andante is religioso, and is fervent\r\nrather than sombre. The ending is especially beautiful. A sprightly\r\nScherzo follows. It is most ingeniously contrived, and the effects are\r\ndivided with unusual impartiality among the instruments. A curious and\r\nelaborate allegro molto furnishes the finale, and ends the \"Nonet\"\r\nsurprisingly with an abrupt major chord.\r\n\r\nThe opening Allegro of the \"Quintet\" begins with a 'cello solo of\r\nscherzesque quality, but as the other voices join in, it takes on a\r\nmore passionate tone, whence it works into rapturously beautiful moods\r\nand ends magnificently. The piano part has a strong value, and even\r\nwhere it merely ornaments the theme carried by the strings, it is\r\nfascinating. The Scherzo is again of the Beethoven order in its\r\ncontagious comicality. The piano has the lion's share of it at first,\r\nbut toward the last the other instruments leave off embroidery and\r\ntake to cracking jokes for themselves. The Andante is a genuinely fine\r\npiece of work. It ranges from melting tenderness to impassioned rage\r\nand a purified nobility. The piano part is highly elaborated, but the\r\nother instruments have a scholarly, a vocal, individuality. I was\r\nshocked to see a cadenza for the piano just before the close, but its\r\ntender brilliance was in thorough accord with the sincerity of the\r\nmovement. The \"Quintet\" ends with a splendid Allegro.\r\n\r\nIn MS. are three interesting works for the violin, a Rhapsody, a\r\nPerpetual Motion, and a Fantasie.\r\n\r\nThis last has a piano accompaniment of much ingenuity. The fantasial\r\nnature of the work lies principally in its development, which is\r\nremarkably lyrical, various melodies being built up beautifully on\r\nfractions of the main subjects. There is nothing perfunctory, and the\r\nwork is full of art and appeal. Gilchrist is one of our most polished\r\ncomposers contrapuntally, but has been here in a very lyric mood.\r\n\r\nHe is the founder and conductor of the Mendelssohn Club of\r\nPhiladelphia, an unusually effective organization; one of the founders\r\nof the local Manuscript Club; the conductor of a choral society of two\r\nhundred voices, at Harrisburg, and the director of two church choirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_G.W. Chadwick._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of G.W. Chadwick]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE WHITEFIELD CHADWICK.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most sophisticated, and, at the same time, most eclectic of\r\nnative music-makers, is George W. Chadwick, to whom the general\r\nconsent of authorities would grant a place among the very foremost of\r\nthe foremost American composers.\r\n\r\nHis reputation rests chiefly on his two symphonies, a number of\r\nconcert overtures, and many pieces of chamber-music, which are much\r\npraised. Chadwick was born at Lowell, Mass., November 13, 1854. His\r\nparents were American, and it was not till 1877, after studying with\r\nEugene Thayer in Boston, and teaching music in the college at Olivet,\r\nMich., that Chadwick studied for two years at Leipzig, under Jadassohn\r\nand Reinecke, and later at Munich for a year under Rheinberger. In\r\n1880 he returned to America and settled in Boston, where he has since\r\nlived, as organist, teacher, and conductor, an important figure in\r\nthe town's musical life.\r\n\r\nAmong his few works for the piano, are \"Six Characteristic Pieces\"\r\n(op. 7). The \"Reminiscence of Chopin\" is an interesting and skilful\r\nchain of partial themes and suggestions from Chopin. The \"Etude\" is a\r\nmonotonous study in a somewhat Schumannesque manner, with a graceful\r\nfinish. The \"Congratulation\" is a cheerful bagatelle; the \"Irish\r\nMelody\" is sturdy, simple, and fetching; but the \"Scherzino\" is a hard\r\nbit of humor with Beethoven mannerisms lacking all the master's\r\nunction.\r\n\r\nThe opus ends with an unfortunate composition inexcusably titled\r\n\"Please Do!\"\r\n\r\nThere are two bright \"Caprices\" and three excellent waltzes, of which\r\nthe third is the best. It is a dreamy, tender work on a theme by\r\n\"B.J.L.,\" which refers, I presume, to Mr. B.J. Lang.\r\n\r\nChadwick has done a vast amount of part-song writing. His \"Lovely\r\nRosabelle\" is for chorus and orchestra, and is marked with many\r\noriginal effects. His \"Reiterlied\" is superbly joyful. A setting of\r\nLewis Carroll's immortal \"Jabberwocky\" shows much rich humor of the\r\ncollege glee-club sort. There is an irresistibly humorous episode\r\nwhere the instrument of destruction goes \"snicker snack,\" and a fine\r\nhilarity at\r\n\r\n    \"'O frabjous day\r\n    Callooh, callay,'\r\n    He chortled in his joy.\"\r\n\r\nWhat would part-song writers do if the Vikings had never been\r\ninvented? Where would they get their wild choruses for men, with a\r\nprize to the singer that makes the most noise? Chadwick falls into\r\nline with \"The Viking's Last Voyage\" (1881), for barytone solo, male\r\nchorus, and orchestra, which gives him a very high place among writers\r\nin this form. He has also a robustious \"Song of the Viking,\" and an\r\nexcellent Dedication Ode (1884), for solo, chorus, and orchestra, to\r\nthe pregnant words of Rev. H.B. Carpenter, besides two cantatas for\r\nmixed voices, \"Phoenix Expirans\" and \"The Pilgrims.\" In 1889 was\r\npublished his \"Lovely Rosabelle,\" a ballad for chorus and orchestra;\r\nit contains some interesting dissonantial work in the storm-passages.\r\nAnd his comic opera, \"Tabasco,\" must be mentioned, as well as an\r\nenormous mass of sacred music, which, I confess, I had not the\r\npatience to study. The flesh was willing, but the spirit was weak.\r\n\r\nAmong Chadwick's songs is a volume of Breton melodies harmonized with\r\nextreme simplicity. Others are \"Gay Little Dandelion,\" which is good\r\nenough of its everlasting flower-song sort; \"In Bygone Days\" and\r\n\"Request,\" which, aside from one or two flecks of art, are trashy; and\r\ntwo childish namby-pambies, \"Adelaide\" and \"The Mill.\" \"A Bonny Curl\"\r\ncatches the Scotch-ton faithfully.\r\n\r\nChadwick usually succeeds, however, in catching foreign flavors. His\r\n\"Song from the Persian\" is one of his best works, and possibly the\r\nvery best is his \"Sorais' Song,\" to Rider Haggard's splendid words.\r\nIt has an epic power and a wild despair. Up to the flippancy of its\r\nlast measures, it is quite inspired, and one of the strongest of\r\nAmerican songs. The \"Danza\" is captivating and full of novelty. \"Green\r\nGrows the Willow\" is a burden of charming pathos and quaintness,\r\nthough principally a study in theme-management. \"Allah,\" however, is\r\nrather Ethiopian than Mahommedan. His \"Bedouin Love Song\" has little\r\nOriental color, but is full of rush and fire, with a superb ending. It\r\nis the best of the countless settings of this song. I wish I could say\r\nthe same of his \"Thou Art so Like a Flower,\" but he has missed the\r\nintense repression of Heine.\r\n\r\n[Music: _To Mrs. G.H. Stoddard._\r\n\r\nTWO FOLK SONGS.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nG.W. Chadwick\r\n\r\n    O love and joy are for a day,\r\n    Then tears and sorrow after,\r\n    O love is for a summer's day,\r\n    And then farewell to laughter.\r\n    If love and joy are for a day\r\n    And then farewell to laughter,\r\n    To live with love give me one day\r\n    Though tears forever after.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1892, by Arthur P. Schmidt.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Serenade\" displays an interesting rhythm; \"The Miller's Daughter\"\r\nis tender, and \"A Warning\" is delightfully witty. One regrets,\r\nhowever, that its best points were previously used in Schumann's\r\nperfect folk-song, \"Wenn ich frueh in den Garten geh'.\" Chadwick has\r\ntwo folk-songs of his own, however, which are superb. \"He Loves Me\" is\r\na tender, cradle-song-like bit of delicious color. The \"Lullaby\" is a\r\ngenuinely interesting study in this overworked form. \"The Lily\" has\r\nthe passionate lyricism of Chaminade, and \"Sweet Wind that Blows\" is a\r\nfine frenzy. The \"Nocturne\" is dainty and has its one good climax.\r\n\"Before the Dawn\" has some of Chadwick's best work; it is especially\r\nmarked by a daring harmonic--you might say--_impasto_.\r\n\r\nHis principal works, besides those mentioned, may be catalogued (I am\r\nunable to do more than catalogue most of them, having seen only one of\r\nthem, \"The Lily Nymph,\" performed, and having read the score of only\r\nthe \"Melpomene\" overture): Concert overtures, \"Rip Van Winkle\"\r\n(written in Leipzig, 1879, and played there the same year), \"Thalia\"\r\n(1883), \"Melpomene\" (1887), \"The Miller's Daughter\" (1887), and\r\n\"Adonais\" (in memory of a friend, 1899); Symphonies, in C (1882), in B\r\n(1885); an Andante for string orchestra (1884), and numerous pieces of\r\nchamber-music. In the case of the cantata, \"The Lily Nymph,\"\r\nChadwick's art was quite futilized by the superb inanities of the book\r\nhe used. The \"Melpomene\" is a work of infinitely more specific\r\ngravity. It is one of the most important of American orchestral works.\r\n\r\nAs his \"Thalia\" was an \"overture to an imaginary comedy,\" so this, to\r\nan imaginary tragedy. It has been played by the Boston Symphony and\r\nmany other orchestras. It has that definiteness of mood with that\r\nindefiniteness of circumstance in which music wins its most dignified\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n    It opens with the solitary voice of the English horn, which\r\n    gives a notable pathos (read Berlioz on this despairful\r\n    elegist, and remember its haunting wail in the last act of\r\n    \"Tristan und Isolde\"). The woeful plaint of this voice\r\n    breathing above a low sinister roll of the tympanum\r\n    establishes at once the atmosphere of melancholy. Other\r\n    instruments join the wail, which breaks out wildly from the\r\n    whole orchestra. Over a waving accompaniment of clarinets,\r\n    the other wood-winds strike up a more lyric and hopeful\r\n    strain, and a soliloquy from the 'cello ends the slow\r\n    introduction, the materials of which are taken from the two\r\n    principal subjects of the overture, which is built on the\r\n    classic sonata formula. The first subject is announced by the\r\n    first violins against the full orchestra; the subsidiary\r\n    theme is given to the flutes and oboes; after a powerful\r\n    climax, and a beautiful subsidence of the storm in the lower\r\n    strings, the second subject appears in the relative major\r\n    with honeyed lyricism. The conclusion, which is made rather\r\n    elaborate by the latter-day symphonists, is reduced to a\r\n    brief modulation by Mr. Chadwick, and almost before one knows\r\n    it, he is in the midst of the elaboration. It is hard to say\r\n    whether the composer's emotion or his counterpoint is given\r\n    freer rein here, for the work is remarkable both for the\r\n    display of every technical resource and for the irresistible\r\n    tempest of its passion. In the reprise there is a climax that\r\n    thrills one even as he tamely reads the score, and must be\r\n    overpowering in actual performance: the cheerful consolation\r\n    of the second subject provokes a cyclonic outburst of grief;\r\n    there is a furious climax of thrilling flutes and violins\r\n    over a mad blare of brass, the while the cymbals shiver\r\n    beneath the blows of the kettledrum-sticks. An abrupt silence\r\n    prepares for a fierce thunderous clamor from the tympani and\r\n    the great drum (beaten with the sticks of the side-drum).\r\n    This subsides to a single thud of a kettledrum; there is\r\n    another eloquent silence; the English horn returns to its\r\n    first plaint; but grief has died of very exercise, and the\r\n    work ends in a coda that establishes a major harmony and\r\n    leaves the hearer with a heart purged white and clean.\r\n\r\nThe \"Melpomene\" overture is a work of such inspiration and such\r\nscholarship that it must surely find a long youth in the chronicle of\r\nour music.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arthur Foote._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARTHUR FOOTE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Arthur Foote]\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach Americans make to the enthusiastic German\r\n_Maennerchor_ is in the college glee clubs. The dignity of their\r\nselections is not always up to that of the Teutonic chorus, but they\r\ndevelop a salutary fondness for color and shading, exaggerating both a\r\nlittle perhaps, yet aiming at the right warmth and variety withal.\r\nEven those elaborate paraphrases and circumlocutions of Mother Goose\r\nrhymes, to which they are so prone, show a striving after dramatic\r\neffect and richness of harmony, as well as a keen sense of wit and\r\nhumor that are by no means incompatible with real value in music.\r\n\r\nAmong their other good deeds must be counted the fostering of the\r\nmusical ambitions of Arthur Foote, who was for two years the leader of\r\nthe Glee Club of Harvard University. Though he has by no means been\r\ncontent to delve no deeper into music than glee-club depths, I think\r\nthe training has been of value, and its peculiar character is patent\r\nin his works. He is especially fond of writing for men's voices, and\r\nis remarkably at home in their management, and he strives rather for\r\ncolor-masses than for separate individualities in the voices.\r\n\r\nAmong his larger works for men's voices is an elaborate setting of\r\nLongfellow's poem, \"The Skeleton in Armor,\" which is full of vigor and\r\ngenerally sturdy in treatment, especially in its descriptions of\r\nViking war and seafaring. The storm-scenes, as in Mr. Foote's \"Wreck\r\nof the Hesperus,\" seem faintly to suggest Wagnerian _Donner und\r\nBlitzen_, but in general Mr. Foote has resisted the universal tendency\r\nto copy the mannerisms so many take to be the real essence of the\r\nBayreuthian. A pretty bit of fancy is the use of a spinning-wheel\r\naccompaniment to the love-song, although the spindle is nowhere\r\nsuggested by the poem. Indeed, the spinning is treated as a\r\ncharacteristic motif for the Norseman's bride, somewhat as it is\r\nSenta's motif in \"The Flying Dutchman.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief fault with the \"Skeleton\" chorus is that it is always\r\nchoric. There are no solos, and the different registers are never used\r\nseparately for more than a bar or two, before the whole mass chimes\r\nin. Even the instrumental interludes are short, and the general effect\r\nmust be rather undiversified, one of sympathy, too, for the unrested\r\nchorus.\r\n\r\n\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\" is an ambitious work, built on large\r\nlines, but hardly represents Mr. Foote at his best. It is for mixed\r\nvoices, and is pitched in a most lugubrious key, being always either\r\nvociferous with panic or dismal with minor woe. A worse trouble yet is\r\nthe attempt to make a short poem fit a long composition. The\r\nProcrustean operation strains even Longfellow sadly.\r\n\r\nThis blemish is lacking in \"The Farewell of Hiawatha,\" which is\r\nwritten for men's voices. Though it, too, is of a sad tone, its sombre\r\nhues are rich and varied as a tapestry. Its effects, though potent,\r\nseem more sincere and less labored. It is altogether noble.\r\n\r\nA larger body of sacred music for mixed voices than many other\r\nAmericans can boast, also swells Foote's opus-score. Here he shows the\r\nsame facility with the quartette as in his other works. In fact, I\r\nthink the effect of glee-club training on his young mind has strongly\r\ninfluenced his whole life-work. And, by the way, the most talented of\r\nall the great Sebastian Bach's twenty-one children--every one a\r\nmusical opus, too--was diverted from the philosopher's career for\r\nwhich he was intended, and into professional musicianship, by just\r\nsuch a glee-club training in the universities at Leipzig and\r\nFrankfort.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of Foote's compositions are written in the close harmony\r\nand limited range of vocal music, and he very rarely sweeps the\r\nkeyboard in his piano compositions, or hunts out startling novelties\r\nin strictly pianistic effect. He is not fond of the cloudy regions of\r\nthe upper notes, and though he may dart brilliantly skyward now and\r\nthen just to show that his wings are good for lighter air, he is soon\r\nback again, drifting along the middle ether.\r\n\r\nHe has won his high place by faithful adherence to his own sober,\r\nserene ideals, and by his genuine culture and seriousness. He is\r\nthoroughly American by birth and training, though his direct English\r\ndescent accounts for his decided leaning toward the better impulses of\r\nthe English school of music. He was born at Salem, Mass., March 5,\r\n1853, and though he played the piano a good deal as a boy, and made a\r\nbeginning in the study of composition with Emery, he did not study\r\nseriously until he graduated from Harvard in 1874. He then took up the\r\nhigher branches of composition under the tuition of John Knowles\r\nPaine, and obtained in 1875 the degree of A.M. in the special\r\ndepartment of music. He also studied the organ and the piano with B.J.\r\nLang at Boston, and has since made that city his home, teaching and\r\nplaying the organ.\r\n\r\nHis overture, \"In the Mountains,\" has been much played from the\r\nmanuscript by orchestras, among them the Boston Symphony. Besides a\r\nconsiderable amount of highly valuable contributions to American\r\nchamber-music, and two fine piano suites, he has written a great many\r\npiano pieces and songs which deserve even greater popularity than they\r\nhave won, because, while not bristling with technical difficulties,\r\nthey are yet of permanent worth.\r\n\r\nI know of no modern composer who has come nearer to relighting the\r\nfires that beam in the old gavottes and fugues and preludes. His two\r\ngavottes are to me among the best since Bach. They are an example of\r\nwhat it is to be academic without being only a-rattle with dry bones.\r\nHe has written a Nocturne that gets farther from being a mere\r\nimitation of Chopin than almost any night-piece written since the Pole\r\nappropriated that form bodily from John Field and made it his own.\r\n\r\nOne of his most original pieces is the Capriccio of his D minor Suite,\r\nwhich is also unusually brilliant in color at times; and he has an\r\nAllegretto that is a scherzo of the good old whole-souled humor.\r\nFoote, in fact, is never sickly in sentiment.\r\n\r\nOf his rather numerous songs, the older English poets, like Marlowe,\r\nSidney, Shakespeare, Suckling, and Herrick, have given him much\r\ninspiration. The song \"It Was a Lover and his Lass\" is especially\r\ntaking. His three songs, \"When You Become a Nun, Dear,\" \"The Road to\r\nKew,\" and \"Ho, Pretty Page!\" written by modern poets in a half-archaic\r\nway, display a most delicious fund of subtile and ironic musical\r\nhumor. \"The Hawthorn Wins the Damask Rose\" shows how really fine a\r\nwell conducted English ballad can be. Among his sadder songs, the\r\n\"Irish Folksong,\" \"I'm Wearing Awa',\" and the weird \"In a Bower\" are\r\nheavy with deepest pathos, while \"Sweet Is True Love\" is as wildly\r\nintense and as haunting in its woe as the fate of the poor Elaine,\r\nwhose despair it sings. This I count one of the most appealing of\r\nmodern songs.\r\n\r\n[Music: IT WAS A LOVER AND HIS LASS\r\n\r\nARTHUR FOOTE, Op. 10, No. 1.\r\n\r\n    1.

Without being\r\ninformed upon the subject, I fancy a certain programmism in the\r\nprologue that is not indicated in the quotation at the beginning of\r\nthe work:\r\n\r\n             \"Nessun maggior dolore,\r\n     Che ricordarsi del tempo felice\r\n     Nella miseria.\"\r\n\r\nThe prologue, however, seems to me to contain more than the\r\npsychological content of these lines from the fifth canto of the\r\n\"Inferno.\"\r\n\r\n    The slow introduction in C minor begins with a long, deep\r\n    sigh, followed by a downward passage in the violas and\r\n    'cellos that seems to indicate the steps that bring Dante and\r\n    Vergil down to the edge of the precipice past which the\r\n    cyclone of the damned rolls eternally. There is some\r\n    shrieking and shuddering, and ominous thudding of the\r\n    tympani (which are tuned to unusual notes), then follows a\r\n    short recitative which might represent Dante's query to\r\n    Francesca how she came to yield to love. Suddenly out of the\r\n    swirling strings the first subject is caught up; it is a\r\n    frenzy passionately sung by the first violins, reenforced by\r\n    the flutes at the crises. The second subject appears after a\r\n    sudden prelude by the brass; it is a very lyric waltz-tune in\r\n    the relative major, and doubtless depicts the joy recalled in\r\n    sorrow. The conclusion is quite lengthy; it is also in waltz\r\n    form, and is first announced by a single flute over the\r\n    violins and violas, the first violins keeping to the gloomy\r\n    G string. This air is now given to a solo horn, and a fierce\r\n    and irresistible dance fervor is worked up. The elaboration\r\n    begins with the first subject in F sharp minor, caught up\r\n    fiercely from a downward rush. The reprise is not long\r\n    delayed, and the second subject appears, contrary to custom,\r\n    in the tonic major instead of the tonic minor. The coda is\r\n    deliciously tender and beautiful, possibly because, being a\r\n    prologue, the work must prepare for a drama that begins\r\n    cheerfully; possibly because after all there is comfort in\r\n    bliss remembered in sorrow.\r\n\r\nTschaikowski has written a symphonic poem on the same subject, which\r\nhas been also the inspiration of numberless dramas, and is one of the\r\nmost pathetic pages in all literature; even the stern old Dante says\r\nthat when he heard Francesca tell her story he almost died of pity,\r\nand fell to the ground as one dead.\r\n\r\nA Serenade for string orchestra (op. 25) contains a Prelude, a tender\r\nAir, a luscious Intermezzo in the rich key of B major with soli for\r\nviolin and 'cello, a Romance with a good climax, and a gallant Gavotte\r\nwith special attention to the too much slighted violas.\r\n\r\nOpus 36 is a suite for full orchestra. It has been played by the\r\nBoston Symphony, and consists of a brilliant Allegro; an Adagio of\r\ndeep sincerity and beautifully varied color, a period wherein the\r\nbrass choir, heavily scored, chants alone, and the division of the\r\ntheme among the wood-wind over the rushing strings is especially\r\neffective; a very whimsical Andante with frequent changes of tempo,\r\nand soli for the English horn in antiphony with the first oboe; and a\r\nmadcap Presto that whisks itself out in the first violins.\r\n\r\nTwo other published works are a string quartette (op. 4) and a\r\nquintette for piano and strings (op. 36). This begins in A minor with\r\na well woven and well derived set of themes, and ends in a scherzo in\r\nA major with spinning-song characteristics. Between these two\r\nmovements comes an intermezzo of strongly marked Scotch tone. This has\r\nbeen performed by the Kneisel Quartette.\r\n\r\n\r\n_S.G. Pratt._\r\n\r\nAlmost every musician has heard of Christopher Columbus, and holds\r\nhim in a certain esteem as a man without whose push the invention of\r\nAmerica would have been long deferred; but few American musicians have\r\nfelt under a sufficient debt of gratitude to make his troubles and\r\ntriumphs the foundation of an appropriate musical work. Silas G. Pratt\r\nwas bold enough to undertake the monumental task; and he expended upon\r\nit large resources of scholarship, research, and enthusiasm. The work\r\nwas performed at New York during the Quadricentennial of the discovery\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nIf Pratt had been born in old Egypt, he would have found his chief\r\ndiversion in the building of pyramids, so undismayed is he by the size\r\nof a task. His patriotism is a sharp spur to him, and has enabled him\r\nto write an orchestral composition devoted to Paul Revere's Ride; a\r\nfantasy descriptive of a battle between the Northern and Southern\r\narmies; \"The Battle of Manila;\" \"The Anniversary Overture,\" in\r\ncommemoration of the centennial of American Independence, performed in\r\nBerlin twice, and in London at the Crystal Palace, during Grant's\r\nvisit there; and a march called by the curious name of \"Homage to\r\nChicago.\" Besides these works Pratt has written the \"Magdalen's\r\nLament,\" his first orchestral composition, suggested by Murillo's\r\npicture; the lyric opera, \"Antonio;\" a first symphony, of which the\r\nadagio was performed in Berlin, the other movements being produced in\r\nBoston and Chicago; a second symphony, \"The Prodigal Son;\" a romantic\r\nopera, \"Zenobia,\" produced in Chicago; a lyric opera, \"Lucille,\" which\r\nran for three weeks in Chicago; a symphonic suite based on the\r\n\"Tempest;\" a canon for a string quartette; a serenade for string\r\norchestra; a grotesque suite, \"The Brownies,\" produced in New York\r\nand at Brighton Beach by Anton Seidl. Besides these works of musical\r\ncomposition, Pratt has delivered various musical lectures, ingeniously\r\ncontrived to entertain the great public and at the same time inform\r\nit. He has been active also in the organization of various musical\r\nenterprises, among them the Apollo Club of Chicago.\r\n\r\nPratt was born in Addison, Vermont, August 4, 1846. At the age of\r\ntwelve, he was thrown on his own resources, and connected himself with\r\nmusic publishing houses in Chicago. After various public performances,\r\nhe went to Germany in 1868, to study the piano under Bendel and\r\nKullak, and counterpoint under Kiel. In 1872 he returned to Chicago\r\nand gave a concert of his own works. But the phoenix city had not\r\nentirely preened its wings after the great fire of 1871, and Pratt\r\nfound no support for his ambitions. After teaching and giving\r\nconcerts, he returned to Germany in 1875, where he attended the\r\nrehearsals of Wagner's Trilogy at Bayreuth, met Liszt here, and gave a\r\nrecital of his own compositions at Weimar. His \"Anniversary Overture\"\r\nwas cordially received by the press of both Berlin and London. A third\r\nvisit to Europe was made in 1885 for the production of the \"Prodigal\r\nSon\" at the Crystal Palace, on the occasion of which, Berthold Tours\r\nwrote that both the symphony and the \"Anniversary Overture\" were\r\n\"grandly conceived works, full of striking originality, modern\r\nharmony, flowing melody, and beautiful, as well as imposing effects.\"\r\n\r\nActivity along such lines has left Pratt little time for the smaller\r\nforms of composition; a few have been published, among them the song,\r\n\"Dream Vision,\" in which Schumann's \"Traeumerei\" is used for violin\r\nobbligato; and a few piano pieces, such as \"Six Soliloquies,\" with\r\npoetic text. In these each chord shows careful effort at color, and\r\nthe work is chromatic enough to convince one that he has studied his\r\nBach thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAmong his massive compositions there are two that seem likely to win,\r\nas they surely deserve, a long life. These are the symphonic suite,\r\n\"The Tempest,\" and the \"Prodigal Son.\" To the latter splendid\r\nachievement, A.J. Goodrich devotes several pages of his \"Musical\r\nAnalysis,\" to which I can do no better than to refer the reader. The\r\n\"Tempest\" is based, of course, on Shakespeare's play, and is described\r\nas follows by the composer:\r\n\r\n    \"It is intended, in the first movement, Adagio, to typify the\r\n    sorrow of Prospero, and his soul's protest against the\r\n    ingratitude and persecution of his enemies. His willing\r\n    attendant Ariel is briefly indicated in the closing measures.\r\n    The Pastoral furnishes an atmosphere or stage setting for the\r\n    lovers, Miranda and Ferdinand, whose responsive love-song\r\n    follows the droning of a shepherd's pipe in the distance.\r\n    Prospero's interruption to their passionate assurances of\r\n    devotion, and the imposition of the unpleasant task, are\r\n    briefly touched upon, and the movement closes with a repeat\r\n    of the pastoral, and alternate reiteration of the lover's\r\n    song. The Finale, after a short introduction, in most sombre\r\n    vein, indicates the flitting about of Ariel and his companion\r\n    sprites as they gather for revelry. The presence of the\r\n    master is soon made apparent by the recurrence, in a\r\n    subdued manner, of Prospero's first theme from the Adagio,\r\n    the fantastic tripping of the elves continuing, as though the\r\n    controlling spirit were conjuring up the fete for the\r\n    amusement of the lovers and himself.\r\n\r\n        \"'Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves;\r\n        And ye that on the sand, with printless foot\r\n        Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him\r\n        When he comes back.'\r\n\r\n    \"The dance then begins, and continues in a fantastic, at\r\n    times grotesque and furious manner, the theme of the lovers\r\n    being interwoven at times, in an unobtrusive way. At length,\r\n    Caliban is heard approaching, singing his drunken song.\r\n\r\n        \"''Ban, 'Ban, Ca-caliban\r\n        Has a new master: get a new man.'\r\n\r\n    \"Ariel and his companions flit about, ridiculing, mocking,\r\n    and laughing at him; eventually prodding and pinching him\r\n    until, shivering, with aching joints, he staggers away. The\r\n    revelry then continues, the song of the lovers becoming more\r\n    and more prominent until, somewhat broadened out, it asserts\r\n    itself triumphantly above all, Ariel and his companions\r\n    flitting about, Prospero happy, and Caliban subjugated, all\r\n    the chief themes being united to form the climax and close of\r\n    the work.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Pratt intentionally omitted the English horn and the bass\r\nclarinet, the scoring is remarkable for its color and faery. The work\r\nis highly lyrical in effect, and the woodsiness is beautifully\r\nestablished. The solemnity of Prospero, the adroitness of the lovers\r\nand the contrasting natures of the volatile Ariel and the sprawling\r\nCaliban, make up a cast of characters in the development of which\r\nmusic is peculiarly competent. The stertorous monologue of Caliban and\r\nhis hobbling dance, and the taunting and pinching torment he is\r\nsubmitted to, make excellent humor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry K. Hadley._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY K. HADLEY.]\r\n\r\nThe word symphony has a terrifying sound, particularly when it is\r\napplied to a modern work; for latter-day music is essentially romantic\r\nin nature, and it is only a very rare composer that has the\r\ninclination or the ability to force the classic form to meet his new\r\nideas. The result is that such a work usually lacks spontaneity,\r\nconviction. The modern writer does much better with the symphonic\r\npoem.\r\n\r\nThe number of American symphonies worth listening to, could be counted\r\non the fingers with several digits to spare. A new finger has been\r\npreempted by Henry K. Hadley's symphony called \"Youth and Life.\" The\r\ntitle is doubly happy. Psychologically it is a study of the intense\r\nemotional life of youth, written by an American youth,--a young man\r\nwho, by the way, strangely reminds one, in his appearance, of\r\nMacmonnies' American type, as represented by his ideal statue of\r\nNathan Hale.\r\n\r\nAnd musically the work is imbued with both youth and life. It has\r\nblood and heart in it. The first movement is a conflict between good\r\nand evil motives struggling like the mediaeval angels for the soul of\r\nthe hero. The better power wins triumphantly. The second movement,\r\nhowever, shows doubt and despair, remorse and deep spiritual\r\ndepression. The climax of this feeling is a death-knell, which,\r\nsmitten softly, gives an indescribably dismal effect, and thrills\r\nwithout starting. Angelus bells in pedal-point continue through a\r\nperiod of hope and prayer; but remorse again takes sway. The ability\r\nto obtain this fine solemnity, and follow it with a scherzo of\r\nextraordinary gaiety, proves that a genius is at large among us. The\r\nScherzo displays a thigh-slapping, song-singing _abandon_ that\r\ntypifies youthful frivolity fascinatingly. A fugue is used\r\nincidentally with a burlesque effect that reminds one of Berlioz'\r\n\"Amen\" parody in the \"Damnation of Faust.\" The Finale exploits motives\r\nof ambition and heroism, with a moment of love. The climax is\r\nvigorous. Without being at all ariose, the symphony is full of melody.\r\nIts melodies are not counterpoint, but expression; and each instrument\r\nor choir of instruments is an individuality.\r\n\r\nHadley is galvanic with energy and optimism, dextrous to a remarkable\r\ndegree in the mechanism of composition. His scoring is mature,\r\nfervent, and certain. His symphony is legitimately programmatic and\r\nalive with brains, biceps, and blood,--all three,--the three great B's\r\nof composition.\r\n\r\nHadley was born at Somerville, Mass., in 1871. His father was a\r\nteacher of music and gave him immediate advantages. He studied harmony\r\nwith Stephen A. Emery, counterpoint with G.W. Chadwick, and the\r\nviolin with Henry Heindl and Charles N. Allen of Boston. Before\r\nattaining his majority, he had completed a dramatic overture, a string\r\nquartette, a trio, and many songs and choruses. In 1894 he went to\r\nVienna and studied composition with Mandyczewski. Here he composed his\r\nthird suite for the orchestra. In 1896 he returned to America and took\r\ncharge of the music department of St. Paul's school at Garden City,\r\nL.I. He has had some experience as a conductor and has been very\r\nprolific in composition. His first symphony was produced under the\r\ndirection of Anton Seidl, in December, 1897; and at a concert of his\r\nown compositions, again, in January, 1900, Hadley conducted this\r\nsymphony, and also two movements from his second symphony, \"The\r\nSeasons.\" These two movements show a mellower technic, perhaps, but\r\nare less vital. He has written three ballet suites with pronounced\r\nsuccess, the work being musical and yet full of the ecstasy of the\r\ndance. His third ballet suite, which is the best, was produced at a\r\nconcert of the American Symphony Orchestra, under Sam Franko.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a festival march, a concert overture, \"Hector and\r\nAndromache,\" two comic operas, and six songs for chorus and orchestra,\r\nbesides a number of part songs and piano pieces, and over one hundred\r\nsongs, forty of which are published, gives proof of the restless\r\nenergy of the man. The high average of scholarship is a proof of his\r\nright to serious acceptance.\r\n\r\nA cantata for orchestra, \"Lelewala,\" a legend of Niagara, is published\r\nfor piano accompaniment. Now, Niagara is a dangerous subject for the\r\nfrail skiffs of rhyme, prose, or music to launch out upon. Barrel\r\nstaves may carry one through the whirlpool, but music staves cannot\r\nstand the stress. Of all the comments upon the Falls of Niagara that I\r\nhave ever read, or heard of, there has been only one that seemed\r\nanything but ridiculously inappropriate; that one was the tribute of a\r\nyoung boy who, on standing face to face with the falls, simply\r\nexclaimed, in an awe-smothered whisper, \"Well, by gosh!\" But it must\r\nbe admitted that these words would baffle the music-making\r\npropensities even of the composer of Haendel's \"Hallelujah Chorus.\"\r\nThat learned composer, George F. Bristow, now dead, made the mistake\r\nof attempting to compass Niagara in a work for chorus and orchestra.\r\nHadley is not exactly guilty of the same fatal attempt in his\r\n\"Lelewala,\" for the poem is chiefly a story of love and sacrifice; but\r\nNiagara comes in as a programmatic incident, and the author of the\r\ntext has fallen lamentably short of his subject in certain instances.\r\nIn other moments, he has written with genuine charm, and the music has\r\nmuch that is worth while.\r\n\r\nAmong his published songs are to be noted the unusually good setting\r\nof Heine's \"Wenn ich in deine Augen seh'\" and of his less often heard\r\n\"Sapphire sind die Augen dein,\" and \"Der Schmetterling ist in die Rose\r\nverliebt.\" A deservedly popular work is \"I Plucked a Quill from\r\nCupid's Wing.\" Among so many morose or school-bound composers, Hadley\r\nis especially important for the fact that he is thrilled with a sane\r\nand jubilant music.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adolph M. Foerster._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADOLPH M. FOERSTER.]\r\n\r\nIt has been fortunate for American song that it forsook the narrow,\r\nroystering school of English ballad and took for its national model\r\nthe _Lied_ of the later German school. It is true that the earlier\r\nEnglish had its poetry-respecting music in the work of such a man as\r\nHenry Lawes, or Purcell, just as it had its composers who far preceded\r\nBach in the key-roving idea of the \"Well-tempered Clavier;\" but that\r\nspirit died out of England, and found its latest avatar in such men\r\nas Robert Franz, who confessed that he had his first and fullest\r\nrecognition from this country.\r\n\r\nA correspondence with Franz was carried on for eighteen years by one\r\nof the solidest of American composers, Adolph M. Foerster, who gives\r\ndistinction to the musical life of Pittsburg. He knew Franz\r\npersonally, and has written an important appreciation of him for the\r\nmagazine _Music_. Foerster was born at Pittsburg in 1854. After three\r\nyears of commercial life, he took up music seriously, and spent the\r\nyears from 1872 to 1875 at Leipzig,--studying the piano under Coccius\r\nand Wenzel, singing under Grill and Schimon, and theory under E.F.\r\nRichter and Papperitz. Returning to America, he connected himself with\r\nthe Fort Wayne (Ind.) Conservatory of Music, then under the direction\r\nof the beneficent inventor of the Virgil Clavier. A year later he\r\nreturned to Pittsburg, where he has since remained. For awhile he was\r\nconductor of a symphonic society and a choral union, which are no\r\nlonger extant. Since, he has devoted himself to teaching and\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nOf Foerster's piano compositions opus 11 is a \"Valse Brillante,\" warm\r\nand melodious. Opus 13 is a \"Sonnet,\" based, after the plan of Liszt,\r\nupon a lyric of Petrarch's, a beautiful translation from his \"Gli\r\nocchi di ch'io parlai si caldamente.\" It is full of passion, and shows\r\na fine variety in the handling of persistent repetition. Opus 18\r\ncouples two sonatinas. The second has the more merit, but both, like\r\nmost sonatinas, are too trivial of psychology and too formal even to\r\nbe recommended for children's exercises. \"Eros\" is a fluent melody,\r\nwith a scherzesque second part.\r\n\r\nOpus 37 contains two concert etudes, both superb works. The first,\r\n\"Exaltation,\" is very original, though neither the beginning nor the\r\nending is particularly striking. The music between, however, has a\r\nfervor that justifies the title. This etude is, like those of Chopin,\r\nat the same time a technical study and a mood. The second, a\r\n\"Lamentation,\" begins with a most sonorous downward harmony, with\r\nrushes up from the bass like the lessening onsets of a retreating\r\ntide. Throughout, the harmonies and emotions are remarkably profound\r\nand the climaxes wild. I should call it one of the best modern piano\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nTwelve \"Fantasy Pieces\" are included in opus 38. They are short\r\ntone-poems. The second, \"Sylvan Spirits,\" is fascinating, and \"Pretty\r\nMarie\" has an irresistibly gay melody. He has dedicated the six songs\r\nof opus 6 to Robert Franz. These are written in a close unarpeggiated\r\nstyle chiefly, but they are very interesting in their pregnant\r\nsimplicity. In two cases they are even impressive: the well-known\r\nlyric, \"Im Rhein, im heiligen Strome,\" and \"Meeresstille.\" Opus 12 is\r\na notable group of three songs: \"Mists\" is superbly harmonious. Opus\r\n25 includes \"Ask Thou Not the Heather Gray,\" a rhapsody of the utmost\r\ningenuity in melody and accompaniment. It has a catching blissfulness\r\nand a verve that make it one of the best American songs. Opus 28 is a\r\nbook called \"Among Flowers.\" The music is in every case good, and\r\nespecially satisfactory in its emancipation from the Teutonism of\r\nFoerster's earlier songs. The song \"Among the Roses\" has a beautiful\r\npoem, which deserves the superb music. It ends hauntingly with an\r\nunresolved major ninth chord on the dominant of the dominant. So the\r\nfrenzy of \"In Blossom Time\" is emotion of a human, rather than a\r\nbotanical sort. \"The Cradle Song\" adapts the Siegfried Idyl, and the\r\n\"Old Proverb\" is rollicking. The two songs of opus 34 are fitted with\r\nwords by Byron. The three songs of opus 44 also make use of this poet,\r\nnow so little in vogue with composers. There are three songs in opus\r\n42: a pathetic \"Little Wild Rose,\" and \"By the Seaside,\" which is full\r\nof solemnity. \"The Shepherd's Lament\" is one of his best lyrics, with\r\na strange accompaniment containing an inverted pedal-point in octaves.\r\nThere are also several part songs.\r\n\r\nIn larger forms, Mr. Foerster is even more successful. Opus 10 is a\r\nCharacter-piece for full orchestra, based on Karl Schaefer's poem,\r\n\"Thusnelda.\" It is short but vigorous, and well unified. Opus 15 is a\r\nFantasie for violin and piano, the piano having really the better of\r\nit. The treatment is very original, and the strong idea well\r\npreserved. Opus 21 is a Quartette for violin, viola, 'cello, and\r\npiano. The first movement begins solemnly, but breaks into an\r\nappassionato. All four instruments have an equal voice in the parley,\r\nand all the outbursts are emotional rather than contrapuntal. A climax\r\nof tremendous power is attained. The second movement omits the piano\r\nfor a beautiful adagio. The third is an hilarious allegro, and the\r\nfinale is an even gayer presto, with movements of sudden sobriety,\r\nsuddenly swept away. Foerster calls this Quartette \"far inferior\" to a\r\nsecond one, opus 40. This, however, I have not seen; but I do not\r\nhesitate to call opus 21 a masterly work.\r\n\r\nOpus 24 is an \"Albumblatt\" for 'cello and piano. It is a wonderwork\r\nof feeling and deep richness of harmony, of absolute sincerity and\r\ninspiration. Opus 29 is a Trio for violin, 'cello, and piano. The\r\nthree begin in unison, andante, whence the 'cello breaks away,\r\nfollowed soon by the others, into the joviality of a drinking bout.\r\nThere is a military moment, a lyric of more seriousness, and a finish\r\nagitato. The second movement is a larghetto highly embroidered. The\r\nthird movement is a vivace with the spirit of a Beethoven presto.\r\n\r\nOpus 36 is a suite for violin and piano, beginning with a most\r\nengaging and most skilful Novelette.\r\n\r\nIn MS. are: an elaborate ballad, \"Hero and Leander,\" which, in spite\r\nof an unworthy postlude and certain \"Tristan und Isolde\" memories, is\r\nardent and vivid with passion; \"Verzweifelung,\" which is bitter and\r\nwild with despair; a suite for piano (op. 46) containing a waltz as\r\ningenious as it is captivating; and a finale called \"Homage to\r\nBrahms.\" This is a remarkably clever piece of writing, which, while it\r\nlacks the Brahmsian trade-mark of thirds in the bass, has much of that\r\ncomposer's best manner, less in his tricks of speech than in his\r\ntireless development and his substitution of monumental thematicism\r\nfor lyric emotion. In MS. is also a prelude to Goethe's \"Faust\" for\r\nfull orchestra. It has very definite leading motives, which include\r\n\"Faust's Meditations,\" \"Visions of Margarethe,\" \"Evil\" and \"Love\"\r\n(almost inversions of each other), \"Mephistopheles,\" and the like. The\r\nstrife of these elements is managed with great cleverness, ending\r\nbeatifically with the motive of Gretchen dying away in the wood-wind.\r\n\r\nAn orchestral score that has been published is the Dedication March\r\nfor Carnegie Hall in Pittsburg. It begins with a long fanfare of horns\r\nheard behind the scenes. Suddenly enters a jubilant theme beginning\r\nwith Andrew Carnegie's initials, a worthy tribute to one to whom\r\nAmerican music owes much.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charles Crozat Converse._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES CROZAT CONVERSE.]\r\n\r\nMusicians are not, as a class, prone to a various erudition (a\r\ncompliment fully returned by the learned in other directions, who are\r\nalmost always profoundly ignorant of the actual art of music). One of\r\nthe rule-proving exceptions is Charles Crozat Converse, who has delved\r\ninto many philosophies. An example of his versatility of interest is\r\nhis coining of the word \"thon\" (a useful substitute for the ubiquitous\r\nawkwardness of \"he or she\" and \"his or her\"), which has been adopted\r\nby the Standard Dictionary.\r\n\r\nConverse' ancestry is American as far back as 1630. Converse was born\r\nat Warren, Mass., October 7, 1832. After being well grounded in\r\nEnglish and the classics, he went, in 1855, to Germany. Here he\r\nstudied law and philosophy, and music at the Conservatorium in\r\nLeipzig. He enjoyed the instruction of Richter, Hauptmann, Plaidy, and\r\nHaupt, and made the acquaintance of Liszt and Spohr. Spohr was\r\nespecially interested in, and influential in, his work, and confident\r\nof its success.\r\n\r\nReturning to America, he graduated from the Law Department of Albany\r\nUniversity in 1860, with the degree of LL.B. The B has since been\r\ndignified into a D, as a tribute to his unusual accomplishments.\r\nConverse declined the honor of a Doctorship of Music from the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, offered him by its professor, the well-known\r\nEnglish composer, Sterndale Bennett, in recognition of his mastery of\r\nlore as evinced in a five-voiced double fugue that ends his\r\nPsalm-Cantata on the 126th Psalm.\r\n\r\nThis scholarly work was performed under the direction of Theodore\r\nThomas in 1888, at Chicago.\r\n\r\nA widely known contribution to religious music is Converse' hymn,\r\n\"What a Friend We Have in Jesus,\" which has been printed, so they say,\r\nin all the tongues of Christendom, and sold to the extent of fifty\r\nmillions of copies. This tune occupied a warm place in my\r\nSunday-schoolboy heart, along with other singable airs of the Moody\r\nand Sankey type, but as I hum it over in memory now, it tastes\r\nsweetish and thin. Its popularity is appalling, musically at least.\r\nConverse has written many other hymn-tunes, which have taken their\r\nplace among ecclesiastical soporifics. Besides, he has recently\r\ncompiled a collection of the world's best hymns into the \"Standard\r\nHymnal.\" In this field Converse, though conventional,--and\r\nconventionality may be considered inevitable here,--is mellow of\r\nharmony and sincere in sentiment.\r\n\r\nNumberless attempts are made to supply our uncomfortable lack of a\r\ndistinctly national air, but few of them have that first requisite, a\r\nfiery catchiness, and most of them have been so bombastic as to pall\r\neven upon palates that can endure Fourth of July glorification.\r\nRecognizing that the trouble with \"America\" was not at all due to the\r\nnoble words written by the man whom \"fate tried to conceal by naming\r\nhim Smith,\" Converse has written a new air to this poem.\r\nUnfortunately, however, his method of varying the much-borrowed\r\noriginal tune is too transparent. He has not discarded the idea at\r\nall, or changed the rhythm or the spirit. He has only taken his tune\r\nupward where \"God Save the Queen\" moves down, and bent his melody down\r\nwhere the British soars up. This, I fancy, is the chief reason why his\r\nnational hymn has gone over to the great majority, and has been\r\nconspicuously absent from such public occasions as torchlight parades\r\nand ratifications.\r\n\r\nExcept the work issued under the alias \"Karl Redan,\" or the anagrams,\r\n\"C.O. Nevers\" and \"C.E. Revons,\" his only secular musics that have\r\nbeen put into print are his American Overture, published in Paris, and\r\na book of six songs, published in Germany.\r\n\r\nMusic is called the universal language, but it has strongly marked\r\ndialects, and sometimes a national flavor untranslatable to foreign\r\npeoples. So with these six songs, not the words alone are German. They\r\nare based on a Teutonic, and they modulate only from Berlin to\r\nBraunschweig and around to Leipzig. While the songs repay study, they\r\nare rather marked by a pianistic meditation than a strictly lyric\r\nemotion. \"Aufmunterung zur Freude\" is a tame allegretto; \"Wehmuth\" is\r\nbetter; \"Taeuschung\" is a short elegy of passion and depth; \"Ruhe in\r\nder Geliebten\" is best in its middle strain where it is full of rich\r\nfeeling and harmony. The ending is cheap. \"Der gefangene Saenger\" is\r\nonly a slight variant at first on the \"Adieu\" credited to Schubert; it\r\nis thereafter excellent.\r\n\r\nConverse has a large body of music in manuscript, none of which I had\r\nthe pleasure of examining save a tender sacred lullaby. There are two\r\nsymphonies, ten suites, and concert overture, three symphonic poems,\r\nan oratorio, \"The Captivity,\" six string quartettes, and a mass of\r\npsalmodic and other vocal writing.\r\n\r\nOf these works three have been produced with marked success: the\r\n\"Christmas Overture,\" at one of the public concerts of the Manuscript\r\nSociety, under the direction of Walter Damrosch; the overture \"Im\r\nFruehling,\" at concerts in Brooklyn and New York, under the baton of\r\nTheodore Thomas; and the American overture, \"Hail Columbia!\" at the\r\nBoston Peace Jubilee under Patrick Gilmore, at the Columbian\r\nExposition under Thomas, and in New York under Anton Seidl.\r\n\r\nThis last overture received the distinction of publication at Paris,\r\nby Schott et Cie. It is built on the rousing air of \"Hail, Columbia!\"\r\nThis is suggested in the slow minor introduction; the air itself is\r\nindicated thematically as one of the subjects later appearing in full\r\nswing in a coda. The instrumentation is brilliant and the climax\r\noverwhelming.\r\n\r\nAltogether the work is more than adroit musical composition. It is a\r\nprairie-fire of patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n_L.A. Coerne._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS ADOLPHE COERNE.]\r\n\r\nA grand opera by an American on an American subject is an achievement\r\nto look forward to. Though I have not seen this opera, called \"A\r\nWoman of Marblehead,\" it is safe to predict, from a study of its\r\ncomposer's other works, that it is a thing of merit.\r\n\r\nLouis Adolphe Coerne, who wrote the music for this opera, was born in\r\nNewark, N.J., in 1870, and spent the years from six to ten in music\r\nstudy abroad, at Stuttgart and Paris. Returning to America, he entered\r\nHarvard College and studied harmony and composition under John Knowles\r\nPaine. He studied the violin under Kneisel. In 1890 he went to Munich,\r\nwhere he studied the organ and composition at the Royal Academy of\r\nMusic, under Rheinberger, and the violin under Hieber. He now decided\r\nto give up the career of a violinist for that of composer, conductor,\r\nand organist. In 1893 he returned to Boston and acted as organist. A\r\nyear later he went to Buffalo, where for three years he directed the\r\nLiedertafel.\r\n\r\nWhile in Harvard, Coerne had composed and produced a concerto for\r\nviolin and 'cello with string orchestra accompaniment, a fantasy for\r\nfull orchestra, and a number of anthems which were performed at the\r\nuniversity chapel. While in Munich and Stuttgart he wrote and produced\r\na string suite, an organ concerto with accompaniment of strings,\r\nhorns, and harps, three choral works, and a ballet, \"Evadne,\" on a\r\nsubject of his own. His symphonic poem on Longfellow's \"Hiawatha\" was\r\nalso produced there with much success under his personal direction,\r\nand later by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was invited then by\r\nTheodore Thomas to attend the World's Fair at Chicago, to give\r\nrecitals on the great organ in Festival Hall.\r\n\r\nIt has been my misfortune not to have heard or seen hardly any of his\r\nwritings except the published \"Character Pieces\" from the ballet\r\n\"Evadne\" (op. 155). A \"Clown's Dance\" in bolero rhythm is delightful.\r\nThe \"Introduction to Act II.\" contains many varied ideas and one\r\npassage of peculiar harmonic beauty. A \"Valse de Salon\" has its good\r\nbits, but is rather overwrought. A \"Devil's Dance\" introduces some\r\nexcellent harmonic effects, but the \"Waltz with Chorus and Finale\" is\r\nthe best number of the opus. It begins in the orchestra with a most\r\nirresistible waltz movement that is just what a waltz should be. A\r\nchorus is then superimposed on this rhapsody, and a climax of superb\r\nrichness attained.\r\n\r\nFor the organ Coerne has written much and well. There is an adaptation\r\nof three pieces from the string quartette (op. 19); a graceful Minuet,\r\na quaint Aria, and a Fugue. Then there are three Marches, which, like\r\nmost marches written by contemplative musicians, are rather thematic\r\nthan spirited, and marked by a restless and elaborate preparation for\r\nsome great chant that is longed for, but never comes. Besides these,\r\nthere are a very pleasant Pastoral, a good Elevation, and a Nocturne.\r\n\r\nCoerne's symphonic poem, \"Hiawatha,\" has been arranged for the piano\r\nfor four hands, and there is also an arrangement for violin or\r\nvioloncello and piano, but I have not seen these. The thing we are all\r\nwaiting for is that American grand opera, \"A Woman of Marblehead.\" It\r\nis to be predicted that she will not receive the marble heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE COLONISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt does not prosper as hermit. Of course, every great creator has a\r\ncertain aloofness of soul, and an inner isolation; but he must at\r\ntimes submit his work to the comparison of his fellow artists; he must\r\nprofit by their discoveries as well as their errors; he must grow\r\noverheated in those passionate musical arguments that never convince\r\nany one out of his former belief, and serve salutarily to raise the\r\ntemper, cultivate caloric, and deepen convictions previously held; he\r\nmust exchange criticisms and discuss standards with others, else he\r\nwill be eternally making discoveries that are stale and unprofitable\r\nto the rest of the world; he will seek to reach men's souls through\r\nchannels long dammed up, and his achievements will be marred by naive\r\ntriteness and primitive crudeness.\r\n\r\nSo, while the artistic tendency may be a universal nervous system,\r\nartists are inclined to ganglionate. The nerve-knots vary in size and\r\nimportance, and one chief ganglion may serve as a feeding brain, but\r\nit cannot monopolize the activity. In America, particularly, these\r\nganglia, or colonies, are an interesting and vital phase of our\r\ndevelopment. For a country in which the different federated states\r\nare, many of them, as large as old-world kingdoms, it is manifestly\r\nimpossible for any one capital to dominate. Furthermore, the national\r\nspirit is too insubordinate to accept any centre as an oracle.\r\n\r\nNew York, which has certainly drawn to itself a preponderance of\r\nrespectable composers, has yet been unable to gather in many of the\r\nmost important, and like the French Academy, must always suffer in\r\nprestige because of its conspicuous absentees. In the second place,\r\nNew York is the least serious and most fickle city in the country, and\r\nis regarded with mingled envy and patronage by other cities.\r\n\r\nBoston is even more unpopular with the rest of the country. And New\r\nYork and other cities have enticed away so many of the leading spirits\r\nof her musical colony, that she cannot claim her once overwhelming\r\nsuperiority. And yet, Boston has been, and is, the highest American\r\nrepresentative of that much abused term, culture. Of all the arts,\r\nmusic doubtless gets her highest favor.\r\n\r\nThe aid Boston has been to American music is vital, and far outweighs\r\nthat of any other city. That so magnificent an organization as its\r\nSymphony Orchestra could be so popular, shows the solidity of its\r\ngeneral art appreciations. The orchestra has been remarkably willing,\r\ntoo, to give the American composer a chance to be heard. Boston has\r\nbeen not only the promulgator, but in a great measure the tutor, of\r\nAmerican music.\r\n\r\nIn Boston-town, folk take things seriously and studiously. In New York\r\nthey take them fiercely, whimsically. Like most generalizations, this\r\none has possibly more exceptions than inclusions. But it is\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient, too, to group together such of the residents of\r\nthese two towns, as I have not discussed elsewhere. The Chicago\r\ncoterie makes another busy community; and St. Louis and Cleveland have\r\ntheir activities of more than intramural worth; Cincinnati, which was\r\nonce as musically thriving as its strongly German qualities\r\nnecessitated, but which had a swift and strange decline, seems to be\r\nplucking up heart again. For this, the energy of Frank van der Stucken\r\nis largely to credit. Aside from the foreign-born composers there, one\r\nshould mention the work of Richard Kieserling, Jr., and Emil Wiegand.\r\nThe former went to Europe in 1891 and studied at the Leipzig\r\nConservatory, under Reinecke, Homeyer, Rust, Schreck and Jadassohn. He\r\nalso studied conducting under Sitt. At his graduation, he conducted a\r\nperformance of his own composition, \"Jeanne d'Arc.\" He returned to his\r\nnative city, Cincinnati, in 1895, where he has since remained,\r\nteaching and conducting. Among his works, besides piano pieces and\r\nsongs, are: \"A May Song,\" for women's chorus and piano; six pieces for\r\nviolin and piano; \"Harold,\" a ballad for male chorus, barytone solo,\r\nand orchestra; \"Were It Not For Love,\" composed for male chorus;\r\nseveral sets of male choruses; a motet for mixed chorus a cappella; a\r\nberceuse for string orchestra, an introduction and rondo for violin\r\nand orchestra; and a \"Marche Nuptiale,\" for grand orchestra.\r\n\r\nEmil Wiegand was also born in Cincinnati, and had his first tuition on\r\nthe violin from his father. His theoretical studies have been received\r\nentirely in Cincinnati. He is a member of the local Symphonic\r\nOrchestra, and has composed an overture for grand orchestra, a string\r\nquartette, and various pieces for the violin, piano, and voice.\r\n\r\nIn San Francisco there is less important musical composition than\r\nthere was in the days when Kelley and Page were active there. The work\r\nof H.B. Pasmore is highly commended by _cognoscenti_, as are also the\r\nworks of Frederick Zeck, Jr., who was born in San Francisco, studied\r\nin Germany, and has composed symphonies, a symphonic poem, \"Lamia,\" a\r\nromantic opera, and other works; Samuel Fleischmann, born in\r\nCalifornia and educated abroad, a concert pianist, who has written,\r\namong other things, an overture, \"Hero and Leander,\" which was\r\nperformed in New York; and P.C. Allen, who studied in Europe, and has\r\nwritten well.\r\n\r\nBut the larger cities do not by any means contain all the worthy\r\ncomposition. In many smaller cities, and in a few villages even, can\r\nbe found men of high culture and earnest endeavor.\r\n\r\nIn Yonkers, New York, is Frederick R. Burton, who has written a\r\ndramatic cantata on Longfellow's \"Hiawatha,\" which has been frequently\r\nperformed. In this work use is made of an actual Indian theme, which\r\nwas jotted down by H.E. Krehbiel, and is worked up delightfully in\r\nthe cantata, an incessant thudding of a drum in an incommensurate\r\nrhythm giving it a decidedly barbaric tone. The cantata contains also\r\na quaint and touching contralto aria, and a pathetic setting of the\r\ndeath-song of Minnehaha. Burton is a graduate of Harvard, and a writer\r\nas well as a composer. He organized, in 1896, the Yonkers Choral\r\nSociety, of which he is conductor.\r\n\r\nAt Hartford, Conn., is Nathan H. Allen, who was born in Marion, Mass.,\r\nin 1848. In 1867 he went to Berlin, where he was a pupil of Haupt for\r\nthree years. In this country he has been active as an organist and\r\nteacher. Many of his compositions of sacred music have been published,\r\nincluding a cantata, \"The Apotheosis of St. Dorothy.\"\r\n\r\nAt Providence, R.I., a prominent figure is Jules Jordan, who was born\r\nat Willimantic, Conn., November 10, 1850, of colonial ancestry. Though\r\nchiefly interested in oratorio singing, in which he has been\r\nprominent, he has written a number of songs, some of which have been\r\nvery popular. The best of these are a rapturous \"Love's Philosophy,\" a\r\ndelicious \"Dutch Lullaby,\" \"An Old Song,\" and \"Stay By and Sing.\" He\r\nhas written some religious songs, part songs, and three works for\r\nsoli, chorus, and orchestra, \"Windswept Wheat,\" \"A Night Service,\" and\r\n\"Barbara Frietchie;\" also \"Joel,\" a dramatic scene for soprano and\r\norchestra, sung at the Worcester Musical Festival by Mme. Nordica.\r\nThis I have not seen, nor his romantic opera, \"Rip Van Winkle.\" In\r\nJune, 1895, Brown University conferred on him the degree of Doctor of\r\nMusic. Two albums of his songs are published.\r\n\r\nA writer of many religious solos and part songs is E.W. Hanscom, who\r\nlives in Auburn, Me. He was born at Durham, in the same State,\r\nDecember 28, 1848. He has made two extended visits to London, Berlin\r\nand Vienna, for special work under eminent teachers, but has chiefly\r\nstudied in Maine. Besides his sacred songs Hanscom has published a\r\ngroup of six songs, all written intelligently, and an especially good\r\nlyric, \"Go, Rose, and in Her Golden Hair,\" a very richly harmonized\r\n\"Lullaby,\" and two \"Christmas Songs,\" with violin obbligato.\r\n\r\nIn Delaware, Ohio, at the Ohio Wesleyan University, is a composer,\r\nWillard J. Baltzell, who has found inspiration for many worthy\r\ncompositions, but publishers for only two, both of these part songs,\r\n\"Dreamland\" and \"Life is a Flower,\" of which the latter is very\r\nexcellent writing.\r\n\r\nBaltzell was for some years a victim of the musical lassitude of\r\nPhiladelphia. He had his musical training there. He has written in the\r\nlarge forms a suite founded on Rossetti's \"Love's Nocturne,\" an\r\noverture, \"Three Guardsmen,\" a \"Novelette\" for orchestra, a cantata,\r\n\"The Mystery of Life,\" and an unfinished setting of Psalm xvii. with\r\nbarytone solo. These are all scored for orchestra, and the manuscript\r\nthat I have seen shows notable psychological power. Other works are: a\r\nstring quartette, a trio, \"Lilith,\" based on Rossetti's poem, \"Eden\r\nBower,\" a nonet, and a violin sonata. He has also written for the\r\npiano and organ fugues and other works. These I have not seen; but I\r\nhave read many of his songs in manuscript, and they reveal a\r\nremarkable strenuousness, and a fine understanding of the poetry. His\r\nsong, \"Desire,\" is full of high-colored flecks of harmony that dance\r\nlike the golden motes in a sunbeam. His \"Madrigal\" has much style and\r\nhumor. He has set to music a deal of the verse of Langdon E. Mitchell,\r\nbesides a song cycle, \"The Journey,\" which is an interesting\r\nfailure,--a failure because it cannot interest any public singer, and\r\ninteresting because of its artistic musical landscape suggestion; and\r\nthere are the songs, \"Fallen Leaf,\" which is deeply morose, and\r\n\"Loss,\" which has some remarkable details and a strange, but\r\neffective, ambiguous ending. Other songs are a superbly rapturous\r\nsetting of E.C. Stedman's \"Thou Art Mine,\" and a series of songs to\r\nthe words of Richard Watson Gilder, a poet who is singularly\r\ninteresting to composers: \"Thistledown\" is irresistibly volatile;\r\n\"Because the Rose Must Fade\" has a nobility of mood; \"The Winter\r\nHeart\" is a powerful short song, and \"Woman's Thought,\" aside from one\r\nor two dangerous moments, is stirring and intense. Baltzell writes\r\nelaborate accompaniments, for which his skill is sufficient, and he is\r\nnot afraid of his effects.\r\n\r\nIn the far Xanadu of Colorado lives Rubin Goldmark, a nephew of the\r\nfamous Carl Goldmark. He was born in New York in 1872. He attended the\r\npublic schools and the College of the City of New York. At the age of\r\nseven he began the study of the piano with Alfred M. Livonius, with\r\nwhom he went to Vienna at the age of seventeen. There he studied the\r\npiano with Anton Door, and composition with Fuchs, completing in two\r\nyears a three years' course in harmony and counterpoint. Returning to\r\nNew York, he studied with Rafael Joseffy and with Doctor Dvorak for\r\none year. In 1892 he went to Colorado Springs for his health. Having\r\nestablished a successful College of Music there, he has remained as\r\nits director and as a lecturer on musical topics.\r\n\r\nAt the age of nineteen he wrote his \"Theme and Variations\" for\r\norchestra. They were performed under Mr. Seidl's leadership in 1895\r\nwith much success. Their harmonies are singularly clear and sweet, of\r\nthe good old school. At the age of twenty Goldmark wrote a trio for\r\npiano, violin, and 'cello. After the first performance of this work at\r\none of the conservatory concerts, Doctor Dvorak exclaimed, \"There are\r\nnow two Goldmarks.\" The work has also had performance at the concerts\r\nof the Kaltenborn Quartette, and has been published. It begins with a\r\ntentative questioning, from which a serious allegro is led forth. It\r\nis lyrical and sane, though not particularly modern, and certainly not\r\nrevolutionary in spirit. The second movement, a romanza, shows more\r\ncontrapuntal resource, and is full of a deep yearning and appeal,--an\r\nextremely beautiful movement. The scherzo evinces a taking jocosity\r\nwith a serious interval. The piano part is especially humorous. The\r\nfinale begins with a touch of Ethiopianism that is perhaps\r\nunconscious. The whole movement is very original and quaint.\r\n\r\nGoldmark's music shows a steady development from a conservative\r\nsimplicity to a modern elaborateness, a development thoroughly to be\r\ncommended if it does not lead into obscurity. This danger seems to\r\nthreaten Goldmark's career, judging from his cantata for chorus and\r\norchestra, the \"Pilgrimage to Kevlaar,\" which, while highly\r\ninteresting in places, and distinctly resourceful, is too abstruse and\r\ngloomy to stand much chance of public understanding.\r\n\r\nMany of the works that I have had the privilege of examining in MS.\r\nhave since been published; there is much originality, much attainment,\r\nand more promise in a number of his songs. His setting of Marlowe's\r\n\"Come Live with Me,\" in spite of a few eccentricities, shows, on the\r\nwhole, a great fluency of melody over an elaborately beautiful\r\naccompaniment. His solemn and mysterious \"Forest Song\" could deserve\r\nthe advertisement of being \"drawn from the wood.\" \"Die erste Liebe\"\r\nshows a contemplative originality in harmony, and ends with a curious\r\ndissonance and resolution. \"O'er the Woods' Brow\" is very strange and\r\ninteresting, though somewhat abstruse. Less so is a song, \"An den\r\nAbendsstern;\" it has a comparison-forcing name, but is a delightful\r\nsong. \"Es muss ein Wunderbares sein\" is notable for novel effects in\r\nharmonies of crystal with light dissonances to edge the facets. A\r\nsonata for piano and violin and a romanza for 'cello have been\r\npublished, and his \"Hiawatha\" overture has been played by the Boston\r\nSymphony Orchestra. On this occasion the always quoteworthy\r\nmezzotintist, James Huneker, wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"The nephew of a very remarkable composer,--for Carl Goldmark\r\n    outranks to-day all the Griegs, Massenets, Mascagnis,\r\n    Saint-Saens, and Dvoraks you can gather,--he needs must fear\r\n    the presence in his scores of the avuncular apparition. His\r\n    'Hiawatha' overture was played by Mr. Gericke and the Boston\r\n    Symphony Orchestra Wednesday of last week. At the first\r\n    cantilena on the strings I nearly jumped out of my seat. It\r\n    was bewilderingly luscious and Goldmarkian,--a young Goldmark\r\n    come to judgment. The family gifts are color and rhythm. This\r\n    youth has them, and he also has brains. Original invention is\r\n     yet to come, but I have hopes. The overture, which is not\r\n    Indian, is full of good things, withal too lengthy in the\r\n    free fantasia. There is life, and while there's life there's\r\n    rhythm, and a nice variety there is. The allegro has one\r\n    stout tune, and the rush and dynamic glow lasts. He lasts,\r\n    does Rubin Goldmark, and I could have heard the piece through\r\n    twice. The young American composer has not been idle lately.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The New York Colony._\r\n\r\nIn every period where art is alive there must be violent faction, and\r\nwherever there is violent faction there is sure to be a _tertium quid_\r\nthat endeavors to bridge the quarrel. The Daniel Websters call forth\r\nthe Robert Haynes, and the two together evoke the compromisers, the\r\nHenry Clays.\r\n\r\nIn the struggle between modernity and classicism that always rages\r\nwhen music is in vitality, one always finds certain ardent spirits who\r\nendeavor to reconcile the conflicting theories of the different\r\nschools, and to materialize the reconciliation in their own work. An\r\ninteresting example of this is to be found in the anatomical\r\nconstruction of one of the best American piano compositions, the\r\nfantasy for piano and orchestra by Arthur Whiting.\r\n\r\nThe composer has aimed to pay his respects to the classic sonata\r\nformula, and at the same time to warp it to more romantic and modern\r\nusages. The result of his experiment is a form that should interest\r\nevery composer. As Whiting phrases it, he has \"telescoped\" the sonata\r\nform. The slow introduction prepares for the first and second\r\nsubjects, which appear, as usual, except that they are somewhat\r\ndeveloped as they appear. Now, in place of the regular development,\r\nthe pastoral movement is brought forward. This is followed by the\r\nreprise of the first and second subjects. Then the finale appears. All\r\nof these movements are performed without pause, and the result is so\r\nsuccessful that Whiting is using the same plan for a quintette.\r\n\r\nHandwriting experts are fond of referring to the \"picture effect\" of a\r\npage of writing. It is sometimes startling to see the resemblance in\r\n\"picture effect\" between the music pages of different composers. The\r\nhandsomely abused Perosi, for instance, writes many a page, which, if\r\nheld at arm's length, you would swear was one of Palestrina's. Some of\r\nMr. Whiting's music has a decidedly Brahmsic picture effect. This\r\nfeeling is emphasized when one remembers the enthusiasm shown for\r\nBrahms in Whiting's concerts, where the works of the Ursus Minor of\r\nVienna hold the place of honor. The resemblance is only skin deep,\r\nhowever, and Whiting's music has a mind of its own.\r\n\r\nThe fantasy in question (op. 11) is full of individuality and\r\nbrilliance. The first subject is announced appassionato by the\r\nstrings, the piano joining with arabesquery that follows the general\r\noutlines. After this is somewhat developed, the second subject comes\r\nin whimsically in the relative major. This is written with great\r\nchromatic lusciousness, and is quite liberally developed. It suddenly\r\ndisappears into what is ordinarily called the second movement, a\r\npastoral, in which the piano is answered by the oboe, flute, clarinet,\r\nand finally the horn. This is gradually appassionated until it is\r\nmerged into the reprise of the first movement proper. During this\r\nreprise little glints of reminiscence of the pastoral are seen. A coda\r\nof great bravery leads to the last movement, which is marked\r\n\"scherzando,\" but is rather martial in tone. The decidedly noble\r\ncomposition ends with great brilliancy and strength. It is published\r\nfor orchestral score and for two pianos.\r\n\r\nWhiting was born in Cambridge, Mass., June 20, 1861. He studied the\r\npiano with William H. Sherwood, and has made a successful career in\r\nconcert playing with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Kneisel\r\nQuartette, both of which organizations have performed works of his. In\r\n1883 he went to Munich for two years, where he studied counterpoint\r\nand composition with Rheinberger. He is now living in New York as a\r\nconcert pianist and teacher.\r\n\r\n[Music: Idylle.\r\n\r\nArthur Whiting.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1895, by G. Schirmer.\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT.]\r\n\r\nFour works of his for the piano are: \"Six Bagatelles,\" of which the\r\n\"Caprice\" has a charming infectious coda, while the \"Humoreske\" is\r\nless simple, and also less amusing. The \"Album Leaf\" is a pleasing\r\nwhimsy, and the \"Idylle\" is as delicate as fleece. Of the three\r\n\"Characteristic Waltzes,\" the \"Valse Sentimentale\" is by far the most\r\ninteresting. It manages to develop a sort of harmonic haze that is\r\nvery romantic.\r\n\r\nFor the voice, Whiting has written little. Church music interests him\r\ngreatly, and he has written various anthems, a morning and evening\r\nservice, which keeps largely to the traditional colors of the\r\nEpiscopal ecclesiastical manner, yet manages to be fervent without\r\nbeing theatrical. A trio, a violin sonata, and a piano quintette, a\r\nsuite for strings, and a concert overture for orchestra complete the\r\nlist of his writings.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a performance of Whiting's \"Fantasy,\" Philip Hale\r\nthus picturesquely summed him up:\r\n\r\n    \"In times past I have been inclined to the opinion that when\r\n    Mr. Whiting first pondered the question of a calling he must\r\n    have hesitated between chess and music. His music seemed to\r\n    me full of openings and gambits and queer things contrived as\r\n    in a game. He was the player, and the audience was his\r\n    antagonist. Mr. Whiting was generally the easy conqueror. The\r\n    audience gave up the contest and admired the skill of the\r\n    musician.\r\n\r\n    \"You respected the music of Mr. Whiting, but you did not feel\r\n    for it any personal affection. The music lacked humanity. Mr.\r\n    Whiting had, and no doubt has, high ideals. Sensuousness in\r\n    music seemed to him as something intolerable, something\r\n    against public morals, something that should be suppressed\r\n    by the selectmen. Perhaps he never went so far as to petition\r\n    for an injunction against sex in music; but rigorous\r\n    intellectuality was his one aim. He might have written A\r\n    Serious Call to Devout and Holy Composition, or A Practical\r\n    Treatise upon Musical Perfection, to which is now added, by\r\n    the same author, The Absolute Unlawfulness of the Stage\r\n    Entertainment Fully Demonstrated.\r\n\r\n    \"There was almost intolerance in Mr. Whiting's musical\r\n    attitude. He himself is a man of wit rather than humor, a man\r\n    with a very pretty knack at sarcasm. He is industrious,\r\n    fastidious, a severe judge of his own works. As a musician he\r\n    was even in his dryest days worthy of sincere respect.\r\n\r\n    \"Now this fantasia is the outward and sure expression of a\r\n    change in Mr. Whiting's way of musical thinking, and the\r\n    change is decidedly for the better. There is still a display\r\n    of pure intellectuality; there is still a solving of\r\n    self-imposed problems; but Mr. Whiting's musical enjoyment is\r\n    no longer strictly selfish. Here is a fantasia in the true\r\n    sense of the term; form is here subservient to fancy. The\r\n    first movement, if you wish to observe traditional\r\n    terminology, is conspicuous chiefly for the skill, yes,\r\n    fancy, with which thematic material of no marked apparent\r\n    inherent value is treated. The pastorale is fresh and\r\n    suggestive. The ordinary pastorale is a bore. There is the\r\n    familiar recipe: take an oboe the size of an egg, stir it\r\n    with a flute, add a little piano, throw in a handful of\r\n    muted strings, and let the whole gently simmer in a 9-8\r\n    stew-pan. But Mr. Whiting has treated his landscape and\r\n    animal kingdom with rare discretion. The music gave pleasure;\r\n    it soothed by its quiet untortured beauty, its simplicity,\r\n    its discretion. And in like manner, without receiving or\r\n    desiring to receive any definite, precise impression, the\r\n    finale interested because it was not a hackneyed form of\r\n    brilliant talk. The finale is something more than clever, to\r\n    use a hideous term that I heard applied to it. It is\r\n    individual, and this praise may be awarded the whole work.\r\n    Remember, too, that although this is a fantasia, there is not\r\n    merely a succession of unregulated, uncontrolled, incoherent\r\n    sleep-chasings.\r\n\r\n    \"In this work there is a warmer spirit than that which\r\n    animated or kept alive Mr. Whiting's former creations. There\r\n    is no deep emotion, there is no sensuousness, there is no\r\n    glowing color, no 'color of deciduous days.' These might be\r\n    incongruous in the present scheme. But there is a more\r\n    pronounced vitality, there is a more decided sympathy with\r\n    the world and men and women; there is more humanity.\r\n\r\n    \"The piano is here an orchestral instrument, and as such it\r\n    was played admirably by Mr. Whiting. His style of playing is\r\n    his own, even his tone seems peculiarly his own, with a\r\n    crispness that is not metallic, with a quality that deceives\r\n    at first in its carrying power. His performance was\r\n    singularly clean and elastic, its personality was refreshing.\r\n    He played the thoughts of Mr. Whiting in Mr. Whiting's way.\r\n    And thus by piece and performance did he win a legitimate\r\n    success.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY HOLDEN HUSS.]\r\n\r\nMany American composers have had their first tuition from their\r\nmothers; few from their fathers. Mr. Huss is one of the latter few.\r\nThe solidity of his musical foundation bespeaks a very correct\r\nbeginning. He was born in Newark, N.J., June 21, 1862. His first\r\nteacher in the theory of music was Otis B. Boise, who has been for the\r\nlast twenty years a teacher of theory in Berlin, though he was born in\r\nthis country. Huss went to Munich in 1883 and remained three years. He\r\nstudied counterpoint under Rheinberger, and won public mention for\r\nproficiency. At his second examination his idyl for small orchestra,\r\n\"In the Forest,\" was produced; and at his graduation he performed his\r\n\"Rhapsody\" in C major for piano and orchestra. A year after his return\r\nto America this work was given by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. A\r\nyear later Van der Stucken gave it at the first of his concerts of\r\nAmerican compositions. The next year Huss' \"Ave Maria,\" for women's\r\nvoices, string orchestra, harp, and organ, was given a public hearing.\r\nThe next year he gave a concert of his own works, and the same year,\r\n1889, Van der Stucken produced his violin romance and polonaise for\r\nviolin and orchestra at the Paris Exposition.\r\n\r\nHis piano concerto for piano and orchestra he played first with the\r\nBoston Symphony Orchestra in 1894, and has given it on numerous\r\noccasions since.\r\n\r\nOther works, most of which have also been published, are: \"The\r\nFountain,\" for women's voices a cappella; a festival \"Sanctus,\" for\r\nchorus and orchestra; an \"Easter Theme,\" for chorus, organ, and\r\norchestra; \"The Winds,\" for chorus and orchestra, with soprano and\r\nalto solos; a \"Festival March,\" for organ and orchestra; a concerto\r\nfor violin, and orchestra; a trio for piano, violin, and 'cello; a\r\n\"Prelude Appassionata,\" for the piano, dedicated to and played by Miss\r\nAdele aus der Ohe, to whom the concerto is also dedicated.\r\n\r\nThis concerto, which is in D major, is a good example of the\r\ncompleteness of Huss' armory of resources. The first movement has the\r\nmartial pomp and hauteur and the Sardanapalian opulence and color that\r\nmark a barbaric triumph. Chopin has been the evident model, and the\r\nresult is always pianistic even at its most riotous point. Huss has\r\nransacked the piano and pillaged almost every imaginable fabric of\r\nhigh color. The great technical difficulties of the work are entirely\r\nincidental to the desire for splendor. The result is gorgeous and\r\npurple. The andante is hardly less elaborate than the first movement,\r\nbut in the finale there is some laying off of the _impedimenta_ of the\r\npageant, as if the paraders had put aside the magnificence for a\r\nperiod of more informal festivity. The spirit is that of the scherzo,\r\nand the main theme is the catchiest imaginable, the rhythm curious and\r\nirresistible, and the entire mood saturnalian. In the coda there is a\r\nreminder of the first movement, and the whole thing ends in a blaze of\r\nfireworks.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of its first performance in Cincinnati, in 1889,\r\nRobert I. Carter wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"It is preeminently a symphonic work, in which the piano is\r\n    used as a voice in the orchestra, and used with consummate\r\n    skill. The charm of the work lies in its simplicity. The\r\n    pianist will tell you at once that it is essentially\r\n    pianistic, a term that is much abused and means little. The\r\n    traditional cadenza is there, but it is not allowed to step\r\n    out of the frame, and so perfect is the relation to what\r\n    precedes and follows, that the average listener might claim\r\n    that it does not exist. Without wishing to venture upon any\r\n    odious grounds of comparison, I want to state frankly that it\r\n    is, to me, emphatically the best American concerto.\"\r\n\r\nHuss is essentially a dramatic and lyric composer, though he seems to\r\nbe determined to show himself also a thematic composer of the old\r\nschool. In his trio, which I heard played by the Kaltenborn Quartette,\r\nboth phases of his activity were seen. There was much odor of the lamp\r\nabout the greater part of the trio, which seemed generally lacking\r\nthat necessary capillarity of energy which sometimes saturates with\r\nlife-sap the most formal and elaborate counterpoint of the\r\npre-romantic strata. The andante of the trio, however, displayed Huss'\r\nsingularly appealing gift of song. It abounded in emotion, and was--to\r\nuse the impossible word Keats coined--\"yearnful.\" Huss should write\r\nmore of this sort of music. We need its rare spontaneity and truth, as\r\nwe do not need the all too frequent mathematics of those who compose,\r\nas Tybalt fought, \"by the book.\"\r\n\r\nFor the piano there are \"Three Bagatelles:\" an \"Etude Melodique,\"\r\nwhich is rather harmonic than melodic; an \"Albumblatt,\" a graceful\r\nmovement woven like a Schumann arabesque; and a \"Pastoral,\" in which\r\nthe gracefulness of the music given to the right hand is annulled by\r\nthe inexplicable harshness of that given to the left.\r\n\r\nFor the voice, there is, of course, a setting of \"Du bist wie eine\r\nBlume,\" which, save for the fact that it looks as if the accompaniment\r\nwere written first, is a very pure piece of writing. The \"Song of the\r\nSyrens\" is a strong composition with a big climax, the \"Jessamine Bud\"\r\nis extremely delicate, and \"They that Sow in Tears\" has much dignity.\r\nThere are two songs from Tennyson, \"There is Sweet Music Here\" and\r\n\"Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead,\" with orchestral accompaniment.\r\n\r\nBy all odds the most important, and a genuinely improved composition\r\nis the aria for soprano and orchestra, \"The Death of Cleopatra.\" The\r\nwords are taken from Shakespeare's play and make use of the great\r\nlines given to the dying Egypt, \"Give me my robe, put on my crown, I\r\nhave immortal longings in me,\" and the rest. The music not only pays\r\nall due reverence to the sacred text, but is inspired by it, and\r\nreaches great heights of fervor and tragedy. From Shakespeare, Huss\r\ndrew the afflation for another aria of great interest, a setting for\r\nbarytone voice of the \"Seven Ages of Man.\" The problems attending the\r\nputting to music of Shakespeare's text are severe; but the plays are\r\ngold mines of treasure for the properly equipped musician.\r\n\r\nA vivid example of the difficulties in the way of American composers'\r\nsecuring an orchestral hearing is seen in the experience of Howard\r\nBrockway, who had a symphony performed in 1895 by the Berlin\r\nPhilharmonic Orchestra, and has been unable to get a hearing or get\r\nthe work performed in America during the five years following, in\r\nspite of the brilliancy of the composition. The scoring of the work is\r\nso mature that one can see its skill by a mere glance at the page from\r\na distance. When the work was performed in Germany, it was received\r\nwith pronounced favor by the Berlin critics, who found in it a\r\nconspicuous absence of all those qualities which the youth of the\r\ncomposer would have made natural.\r\n\r\nBrockway was born in Brooklyn, November 22, 1870, and studied piano\r\nwith H.O.C. Kortheuer from 1887 to 1889. He went to Berlin at the\r\nage of twenty and studied the piano with Barth, and composition with\r\nO.B. Boise, the transplanted American. Boise gave Brockway so\r\nthorough a training that he may be counted one of the most fluent and\r\ncompletely equipped American composers. At the age of twenty-four he\r\nhad finished his symphony (op. 12), a ballade for orchestra (op. 11),\r\nand a violin and piano sonata (op. 9), as well as a cavatina for\r\nviolin and orchestra. These, with certain piano solos, were given at a\r\nconcert of Brockway's own works in February, 1895, at the\r\nSing-Akademie. His works were accepted as singularly mature, and\r\npromising as well. A few months later, Brockway returned to New York,\r\nwhere he has since lived as a teacher and performer.\r\n\r\nHis symphony, which is in D major, is so ebullient with life that its\r\ndashing first subject cannot brook more than a few measures of slow\r\nintroduction. The second subject is simpler, but no less joyous. The\r\nthematic work is scholarly and enthusiastic at the same time. The\r\ndifferent movements of the symphony are, however, not thematically\r\nrelated, save that the coda of the last movement is a reminiscence of\r\nthe auxiliary theme of the first movement. The andante, in which the\r\n'cellos are very lyrical, is a tender and musing mood. The presto is\r\nflashing with life and has a trio of rollicking, even whooping,\r\njubilation. The finale begins gloomily and martially, and it is\r\nsucceeded by a period of beauty and grace. This movement, in fact, is\r\na remarkable combination of the exquisitest beauty and most\r\nunrestrained prowess.\r\n\r\nAnother orchestral work of great importance in American music is the\r\n\"Sylvan Suite\" (op. 19), which is also arranged for the piano. In this\r\nwork the composer has shown a fine discretion and conservation in the\r\nuse of the instruments, making liberal employment of small choirs for\r\nlong periods. The work is programmatic in psychology only. It begins\r\nwith a \"Midsummer Idyl,\" which embodies the drowsy petulance of hot\r\nnoon. The second number is \"Will o' the Wisps.\" In this a three-voiced\r\nfugue for the strings, wood, and one horn has been used with\r\nlegitimate effect and most teasing, fleeting whimsicality. The third\r\nmovement is a slow waltz, called \"The Dance of the Sylphs,\" a very\r\ncatchy air, swaying delicately in the bassoons and 'cello; a short\r\n\"Evening Song\" is followed by \"Midnight.\" This is a parade that\r\nreminds one strongly of Gottschalk's \"Marche de Nuit.\" The march\r\nmovement is followed by an interlude depicting the mystery of night,\r\nas Virgil says, \"_tremulo sub lumine_.\" The composer has endeavored to\r\nindicate the chill gray of dawn by the ending of this movement: a\r\nchord taken by two flutes and the strings shivering _sul ponticello_.\r\nThe last movement is \"At Daybreak.\" Out of the gloom of the bassoons\r\ngrows a broad and general luminous song followed by an interlude of\r\nthe busy hum of life; this is succeeded by the return of the sunrise\r\ntheme with a tremendously vivacious accompaniment.\r\n\r\nOther works of Brockway's are: a cantata, a set of variations, a\r\nballade, a nocturne, a Characterstueck, a Fantasiestueck, a set of four\r\npiano pieces (op. 21), and two piano pieces (op. 25). All of these,\r\nexcept the cantata, have been published. Two part songs and two songs\r\nwith piano accompaniment have also been published; a violin sonata, a\r\nMoment Musicale, and a romanza for violin and orchestra have been\r\npublished in Berlin.\r\n\r\nThese works all show a decided tendency to write brilliant and\r\ndifficult music, but the difficulties are legitimate to the effect and\r\nthe occasion. The Ballade works up a very powerful climax; the\r\nScherzino swishes fascinatingly; and the Romanza for piano is a\r\nnotably mature and serious work.\r\n\r\n[Music: Copyright, 1894, by Schlesinger'sche Buch und Musikhandlung\r\n(Rob. Lienau), Berlin.\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF A \"BALLADE\" BY HOWARD BROCKWAY.]\r\n\r\nTwo ballads have made the so romantic name of Harry Rowe Shelley a\r\nhousehold word in America. They are the setting of Tom Moore's fiery\r\n\"Minstrel Boy,\" and a strange jargon of words called \"Love's Sorrow.\"\r\nIn both cases the music is intense and full of fervor, and quick\r\npopularity rarely goes out to more worthy songs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Harry Rowe Shelley]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRY ROWE SHELLEY.]\r\n\r\nBut Shelley would doubtless prefer to be judged by work to which he\r\nhas given more of his art and his interest than to the many songs that\r\nhe has tossed off in the light name of popularity.\r\n\r\nShelley's life has been largely devoted to church work. Born in New\r\nHaven, Conn., June 8, 1858, and taught music by Gustav J. Stoeckel, he\r\ncame under the tuition of Dudley Buck for seven years. His twentieth\r\nyear found him an organist at New Haven. Three years later he went to\r\nBrooklyn in the same capacity. He was the organist at Plymouth Church\r\nfor some time before Henry Ward Beecher's death. Since 1887 he has\r\nbeen at the Church of the Pilgrims. He visited Europe in 1887 and\r\nstudied under Dvorak when the Bohemian master was here.\r\n\r\nShelley's largest works have been an opera, \"Leila,\" still in\r\nmanuscript, a symphonic poem, \"The Crusaders,\" a dramatic overture,\r\n\"Francesca da Rimini,\" a sacred oratorio, \"The Inheritance Divine,\" a\r\nsuite for orchestra, a fantasy for piano and orchestra (written for\r\nRafael Joseffy), a one-act musical extravaganza, a three-act lyric\r\ndrama, and a virile symphony. The suite is called \"Souvenir de\r\nBaden-Baden.\" It is a series of highly elaborated trifles of much\r\ngaiety, and includes a lively \"Morning Promenade,\" a dreamy \"Siesta,\"\r\na \"Conversationshaus Ball,\" and a quaint \"Serenade Orientale\" that\r\nshows the influence of Mozart's and Beethoven's marches alla turca.\r\nThe orchestration of this work I have never heard nor seen. Its\r\narrangement for four hands, however, is excellently done, with\r\ncommendable attention to the interests of the _secondo_ player.\r\n\r\nThe cantata is called \"The Inheritance Divine,\" and it is much the\r\nbest thing Shelley has done. It begins with a long, slow crescendo on\r\nthe word \"Jerusalem,\" which is very forceful. Shelley responds to an\r\nimaginary encore, however, and the word becomes little more than an\r\nexpletive.\r\n\r\nPage 7--to refer more conveniently than technically--is marked by\r\nsonorous harmonies of especial nobility. Now begins a new idea worked\r\nup with increased richness and growing fervor to a sudden magnificence\r\nof climax in the second measure on page 11. The final phrase,\r\nstrengthened by an organ-point on two notes, is fairly thrilling. A\r\ntenor solo follows, its introductory recitative containing many fine\r\nthings, its aria being smoothly melodious. A chorus, of warm harmonies\r\nand a remarkably beautiful and unexpected ending, is next; after which\r\nis a sombre, but impressive alto solo. The two successive choruses,\r\nthe quartette, and the soprano solo catch the composer nodding. The\r\nbass solo is better; the final chorus brings us back to the high\r\nplane. Page 62 is particularly big of spirit, and from here on the\r\nchorus climbs fiery heights. In spite of Berlioz' famous parody on the\r\n\"Amen\" fugues, in the \"Damnation of Faust,\" Shelley has used the word\r\nover a score of times in succession to finish his work. But altogether\r\nthe work is one of maturity of feeling and expression, and it is a\r\nnotable contribution to American sacred music.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 \"Death and Life\" was published. It opens with a dramatic\r\nchorus sung by the mob before the cross, and it ends daringly with a\r\nunisonal descent of the voices that carries even the sopranos down to\r\nA natural. In the duet between Christ and Mary, seeking where they\r\nhave laid her Son, the librettist has given Christ a versified\r\nparaphrase which is questionable both as to taste and grammar. The\r\nfinal chorus, however, has a stir of spring fire that makes the work\r\nespecially appropriate for Easter services.\r\n\r\nThe cantata \"Vexilla Regis\" is notable for its martial opening chorus,\r\nthe bass solo, \"Where deep for us the spear was dyed,\" and its\r\nscholarly and effective ending.\r\n\r\nA lapidary's skill and delight for working in small forms belongs to\r\nGerrit Smith. His \"Aquarelles\" are a good example of his art in\r\nbijouterie. This collection includes eight songs and eight piano\r\nsketches. The first, \"A Lullaby,\" begins with the unusual skip of a\r\nninth for the voice. A subdued accentuation is got by the syncopation\r\nof the bass, and the yearning tenderness of the ending finishes an\r\nexquisite song. \"Dream-wings\" is a graceful fantasy that fittingly\r\npresents the delicate sentiment of Coleridge' lyrics. The setting of\r\nHeine's \"Fir-tree\" is entirely worthy to stand high among the numerous\r\nsettings of this lyric. Smith gets the air of desolation of the bleak\r\nhome of the fir-tree by a cold scale of harmony, and a bold simplicity\r\nof accompaniment. The home of the equally lonely palm-tree is strongly\r\ncontrasted by a tropical luxuriance of interlude and accompaniment.\r\n\r\nThe sixth song is a delightful bit of brilliant music, but it is quite\r\nout of keeping with the poem. Thus on the words, \"Margery's only\r\nthree,\" there is a fierce climax fitting an Oriental declaration of\r\ndespair. The last of these songs, \"Put by the Lute,\" is possibly\r\nSmith's best work. It is superb from beginning to end. It opens with a\r\nmost unhackneyed series of preludizing arpeggios, whence it breaks\r\ninto a swinging lyric, strengthened into passion by a vigorous\r\ncontramelody in the bass. Throughout, the harmonies are most\r\noriginal, effective, and surprising.\r\n\r\nOf the eight instrumental pieces in this book, the exquisite and\r\nfluent \"Impromptu\" is the best after the \"Cradle Song,\" which is\r\ndrowsy with luscious harmony and contains a passage come organo of\r\nsuch noble sonority as to put it a whit out of keeping with a child's\r\nlullaby.\r\n\r\nSmith was born December 11, 1859, at Hagerstown, Md. His first\r\ninstruction was gained in Geneva, N.Y., from a pupil of Moscheles. He\r\nbegan composition early, and works of his written at the age of\r\nfourteen were performed at his boarding-school. He graduated at Hobart\r\nCollege in 1876, whence he went to Stuttgart to study music and\r\narchitecture. A year later he was in New York studying the organ with\r\nSamuel P. Warren. He was appointed organist at St. Paul's, Buffalo,\r\nand studied during the summer with Eugene Thayer, and William H.\r\nSherwood. In 1880 he went again to Germany, and studied organ under\r\nHaupt, and theory under Rohde, at Berlin. On his return to America he\r\ntook the organ at St. Peter's, in Albany. Later he came to New York,\r\nwhere he has since remained continuously, except for concert tours and\r\njourneys abroad. He has played the organ in the most important English\r\nand Continental towns, and must be considered one of our most\r\nprominent concert organists. He is both a Master of Arts and a Doctor\r\nof Music. As one of the founders, and for many years the president, of\r\nthe Manuscript Society, he was active in obtaining a hearing for much\r\nnative music otherwise mute.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a goodly number of Easter carols, Christmas anthems, Te\r\nDeums, and such smaller forms of religious music, Smith has written a\r\nsacred cantata, \"King David.\" Aside from this work, which in\r\norchestration and in general treatment shows undoubted skill for large\r\neffort, Doctor Smith's composition has been altogether along the\r\nsmaller lines.\r\n\r\nThe five-song'd opus 14 shows well matured lyric power, and an\r\nincrease in fervor of emotion. Bourdillon's \"The Night Has a Thousand\r\nEyes,\" which can never be too much set to music, receives here a truly\r\nsuperb treatment. The interlude, which also serves for finale, is\r\nespecially ravishing. \"Heart Longings\" is one of Mr. Smith's very best\r\nsuccesses. It shows a free passion and a dramatic fire unusual for his\r\nrather quiet muse. The setting of Bourdillon's fine lyric is indeed so\r\nstirring that it deserves a high place among modern songs. \"Melody\"\r\nis a lyric not without feeling, but yet inclusive of most of Smith's\r\nfaults. Thus the prelude, which is a tritely flowing allegro, serves\r\nalso for interlude as well as postlude, and the air and accompaniment\r\nof both stanzas are unvaried, save at the cadence of the latter\r\nstanza. The intense poesy of Anna Reeve Aldrich, a poetess cut short\r\nat the very budding of unlimited promise, deserved better care than\r\nthis from a musician. Two of Smith's works were published in Millet's\r\n\"Half-hours with the Best Composers,\"--one of the first substantial\r\nrecognitions of the American music-writer. A \"Romance,\" however, is\r\nthe best and most elaborate of his piano pieces, and is altogether an\r\nexquisite fancy. His latest work, a cycle of ten pieces for the piano,\r\n\"A Colorado Summer,\" is most interesting. The pieces are all lyrical\r\nand simple, but they are full of grace and new colors.\r\n\r\n[Music: Spring.\r\n\r\nWords by Alfred Tennyson.\r\n\r\nGERRIT SMITH, OP. 13, NO. 4.\r\n\r\n    Bird's love and bird's song,\r\n    Flying here and there,\r\n    Bird's song and bird's love,\r\n    And you with gold for hair.\r\n    Bird's song and bird's love,\r\n    Passing with the weather,\r\n    Men's song and men's love,\r\n    To love once and forever.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1894, by Arthur P. Schmidt.\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT.]\r\n\r\nBut Smith's most individual work is his set of songs for children,\r\nwhich are much compared, and favorably, with Reinecke's work along the\r\nsame lines. These are veritable masterpieces of their sort, and they\r\nare mainly grouped into opus 12, called \"Twenty-five Song Vignettes.\"\r\n\r\nSo well are they written that they are a safe guide, and worthy that\r\nsupreme trust, the first formation of a child's taste. Even\r\ndissonances are used, sparingly but bravely enough to give an idea of\r\nthe different elements that make music something more than a sweetish\r\nimpotence. They are vastly different from the horrible trash children\r\nare usually brought up on, especially in our American schools, to the\r\nalmost incurable perversion of their musical tastes. They are also so\r\nfull of refinement, and of that humor without which children cannot\r\nlong be held, that they are of complete interest also to \"grown-ups,\"\r\nto whom alone the real artistic value of these songs can entirely\r\ntranspire. Worthy of especial mention are the delicious \"Stars and\r\nAngels;\" the delightful \"A Carriage to Ride In;\" \"Good King Arthur,\" a\r\ncaptivating melody, well built on an accompaniment of \"God Save the\r\nKing;\" \"Birdie's Burial,\" an elegy of the most sincere pathos, quite\r\nworthy of a larger cause,--if, indeed, any grief is greater than the\r\nfirst sorrows of childhood; the surprisingly droll \"Barley Romance;\"\r\n\"The Broom and the Rod,\" with its programmatic _glissandos_ to give\r\nthings a clean sweep; and other delights like the \"Rain Song,\" \"The\r\nTomtit Gray,\" \"Mamma's Birthday,\" and \"Christmas at the Door.\" To have\r\ngiven these works their present value and perfection, is to have\r\naccomplished a far greater thing than the writing of a dozen tawdry\r\nsymphonies.\r\n\r\nOne of the most outrageously popular piano pieces ever published in\r\nAmerica was Homer N. Bartlett's \"Grande Polka de Concert.\" It was his\r\nopus 1, written years ago, and he tells me that he recently refused a\r\nlucrative commission to write fantasies on \"Nearer My God to Thee\" and\r\n\"The Old Oaken Bucket\"! So now that he has reformed, grown wise and\r\nsigned the musical pledge, one must forgive him those wild oats from\r\nwhich he reaped royalties, and look to the genuine and sincere work he\r\nhas latterly done. Let us begin, say, with opus 38, a \"Polonaise\" that\r\nout-Herods Chopin in bravura, but is full of vigor and well held\r\ntogether. A \"Dance of the Gnomes,\" for piano, is also arranged for a\r\nsextet, the arrangement being a development, not a bare transcription.\r\nThere are two mazurkas (op. 71), the first very original and happy.\r\n\"AEolian Murmurings\" is a superb study in high color. A \"Caprice\r\nEspanol\" is a bravura realization of Spanish frenzy. It has also been\r\nbrilliantly orchestrated. Two songs without words make up opus 96:\r\nwhile \"Meditation\" shows too evident meditation on Wagner, \"A Love\r\nSong\" gets quite away from musical bourgeoisery. It is free, spirited,\r\neven daring. It is patently less devoted to theme-development than to\r\nthe expression of an emotion. This \"Love Song\" is one of the very best\r\nof American morceaux, and is altogether commendable.\r\n\r\nOpus 107 includes three \"characteristic pieces.\" \"The Zephyr\" is\r\ndangerously like Chopin's fifteenth Prelude, with a throbbing\r\norgan-point on the same A flat. On this alien foundation, however,\r\nBartlett has built with rich harmony. The \"Harlequin\" is graceful and\r\ncheery. It ends with Rubinstein's sign and seal, an arpeggio in\r\nsixths, which is as trite a musical finis as fiction's \"They lived\r\nhappily ever afterward, surrounded by a large circle of admiring\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\nThree mazurkas constitute opus 125. They are closely modelled on\r\nChopin, and naturally lack the first-handedness of these works, in\r\nwhich, almost alone, the Pole was witty. But Bartlett has made as\r\noriginal an imitation as possible. The second is particularly\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\nIn manuscript is a Prelude developed interestingly on well-understood\r\nlines. There is a superb \"Reverie Poetique.\" It is that climax of\r\nsuccess, a scholarly inspiration. To the meagre body of American\r\nscherzos, Bartlett's scherzo will be very welcome. It is very festive\r\nand very original. Its richly harmonized interlude shows a complete\r\nemancipation from the overpowering influence of Chopin, and a great\r\ngain in strength as well as individuality.\r\n\r\nIn his songs Bartlett attains a quality uniformly higher than that of\r\nhis piano pieces. \"Moonbeams\" has many delicacies of harmony.\r\n\"Laughing Eyes\" is a fitting setting of Mr. \"Nym Crinkle\" Wheeler's\r\nexquisite lyric. \"Come to Me, Dearest,\" while cheap in general design,\r\nhas fine details.\r\n\r\nIt makes me great dole to have to praise a song about a brooklet; but\r\nthe truth is, that Bartlett's \"I Hear the Brooklet's Murmur\" is\r\nsuperbly beautiful, wild with regret,--a noble song. It represents the\r\nlate German type of _Lied_, as the earlier heavy style is exemplified\r\nin \"Good Night, Dear One.\" Very Teutonic also is the airiness and\r\ngrace of \"Rosebud.\"\r\n\r\nTo that delightful collection of children's songs, \"The St. Nicholas\r\nSong Book,\" Bartlett contributed largely. All of his lyrics are\r\ndelicious, and \"I Had a Little Pony\" should become a nursery classic.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Lord God, Hear My Prayer,\" Bartlett throws down the gauntlet\r\nto the Bach-Gounod \"Ave Maria,\" with results rather disastrous. He\r\nchooses a Cramer etude, and adds to it parts for voice, violin, and\r\norgan. While Gounod seems passionate and unrestrained, Bartlett shows\r\nhis caution and his cage at every step. A Cramer etude is among the\r\nmost melancholy things of earth anyway. \"Jehovah Nissi\" is an\r\nexcellent sacred march chorus that won a prize, and there is a\r\ncantata, \"The Last Chieftain.\" Bartlett's cantata is without efforts\r\nat Indian color, but is a solid work with much dignity, barbaric\r\nseverity, and fire.\r\n\r\nBartlett was born at Olive, N.Y., December 28, 1846. His ancestry\r\nruns far back into New England, his mother being a descendant of John\r\nRogers, the martyr. Bartlett is said to have \"lisped in numbers,\"\r\nsinging correctly before he could articulate words. The violin was his\r\nfirst love, and at the age of eight he was playing in public. He took\r\nup the piano and organ also, and in his fourteenth year was a church\r\norganist. He studied the piano with S.B. Mills, Emil Guyon (a pupil\r\nof Thalberg), and Alfred Pease. The organ and composition he studied\r\nwith O.F. Jacobsen and Max Braun. With the exception of a musical\r\npilgrimage in 1887, Bartlett has not come nearer the advantages of\r\nEurope than study here under men who studied there. He has resided for\r\nmany years in New York as organist and teacher. As a composer he has\r\nbeen one of our most prolific music-makers. His work shows a steady\r\ndevelopment in value, and the best is doubtless yet to come.\r\n\r\nHe finds a congenial field in the orchestra. Seidl played his\r\ninstrumentation of Chopin's \"Military Polonaise\" several times. As the\r\nwork seemed to need a finale in its larger form, Bartlett took a\r\nliberty whose success was its justification, and added a finish made\r\nup of the three principal themes interwoven. A recent work is his\r\n\"Concertstueck,\" for violin and orchestra. It is not pianistic in\r\ninstrumentation, and will appeal to violinists. While not marked with\r\n_recherches_ violin tricks, or violent attempts at bravura, it has\r\nboth brilliance and solidity, and is delightfully colored in\r\norchestration. There are no pauses between the movements, but they are\r\nwell varied in their unity.\r\n\r\nThere is an unfinished oratorio, \"Samuel,\" an incomplete opera,\r\n\"Hinotito,\" and a cantata of which only the tenor solo, \"Khamsin,\" is\r\ndone. This is by far the best work Bartlett has written, and displays\r\nunexpected dramatic powers. The variation of the episodes of the\r\nvarious phases of the awful drought to the climax in \"The Plague,\"\r\nmake up a piece of most impressive strength. The orchestration is\r\nremarkably fine with effect, color, and variety. If the cantata is\r\nfinished on this scale, its production will be a national event.\r\n\r\nThe New England farmer is usually taken as a type of sturdy\r\nPhilistinism in artistic matters. It was a most exceptional good\r\nfortune that gave C.B. Hawley a father who added to the dignity of\r\nbeing a tiller of the soil the refinements of great musical taste and\r\nskill. His house at Brookfield, Conn., contained not only a grand\r\npiano, but a pipe organ as well; and Hawley's mother was blessed with\r\na beautiful and cultivated voice.\r\n\r\nAt the age of thirteen (he was born St. Valentine's Day, 1858) Hawley\r\nwas a church organist and the conductor of musical affairs in the\r\nCheshire Military Academy, from which he graduated. He went to New\r\nYork at the age of seventeen, studying the voice with George James\r\nWebb, Rivarde, Foederlein, and others, and composition with Dudley\r\nBuck, Joseph Mosenthal, and Rutenber.\r\n\r\nHis voice brought him the position of soloist at the Calvary Episcopal\r\nChurch, at the age of eighteen. Later he became assistant organist at\r\nSt. Thomas' Episcopal Church, under George William Warren. For the\r\nlast fourteen years he has had charge of the summer music at St. James\r\nChapel, in Elberon, the chapel attended by Presidents Grant and\r\nGarfield. For seventeen years he has been one of the leading spirits\r\nof the Mendelssohn Glee Club, and for ten years a member of the\r\nMendelssohn Quartet Club. Most of his part songs were written for the\r\nclub and first sung at its concerts. He is also a successful teacher\r\nof the voice, and has been too busy to write a very large volume of\r\ncompositions. But those published show the authentic fire.\r\n\r\nNotable features of Hawley's compositions are the taking quality of\r\nthe melody, its warm sincerity, and the unobtrusive opulence in color\r\nof the accompaniment. This is less like an answering, independent\r\nvoice than like a many-hued, velvety tapestry, backgrounding a\r\nbeautiful statue. It is only on second thought and closer study that\r\none sees how well concealed is the careful and laborious polish _ad\r\nunguem_ of every chord. This is the true art of song, where the lyrics\r\nshould seem to gush spontaneously forth from a full heart and yet\r\nrepay the closer dissection that shows the intellect perfecting the\r\nvoice of emotion.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, his \"Lady Mine,\" a brilliant rhapsody, full of the\r\nspring, and enriched with a wealth of color in the accompaniment till\r\nthe melody is half hidden in a shower of roses. It required courage to\r\nmake a setting of \"Ah, 'Tis a Dream!\" so famous through Lassen's\r\nmelody; but Hawley has said it in his own way in an air thrilled with\r\nlonging and an accompaniment as full of shifting colors as one of the\r\nnative sunsets. I can't forbear one obiter dictum on this poem. It has\r\nnever been so translated as to reproduce its neatest bit of fancy. In\r\nthe original the poet speaks of meeting in dreams a fair-eyed maiden\r\nwho greeted him \"auf Deutsch\" and kissed him \"auf Deutsch,\" but the\r\ntranslations all evade the kiss in German.\r\n\r\n\"The Ring,\" bounding with the glad frenzy of a betrothed lover, has a\r\nsoaring finale, and is better endowed with a well polished\r\naccompaniment than the song, \"Because I Love You, Dear,\" which is not\r\nwithout its good points in spite of its manifest appeal to a more\r\npopular taste. \"My Little Love,\" \"An Echo,\" \"Spring's Awakening,\" and\r\n\"Where Love Doth Build His Nest,\" are conceived in Hawley's own vein.\r\n\r\nThe song, \"Oh, Haste Thee, Sweet,\" has some moments of banality, but\r\nmore of novelty; the harmonic work being unusual at times, especially\r\nin the rich garb of the words, \"It groweth late.\" In \"I Only Can Love\r\nThee,\" Hawley has succeeded in conquering the incommensurateness of\r\nMrs. Browning's sonnet by alternating 6-8 and 9-8 rhythms. His \"Were I\r\na Star,\" is quite a perfect lyric.\r\n\r\nOf his part songs, all are good, some are masterly. Here he colors\r\nwith the same lavish but softly blending touch as in his solos. \"My\r\nLuve's Like a Red, Red Rose\" is altogether delightful, containing as\r\nit does a suggestion of the old formalities and courtly graces of the\r\nmusic of Lawes, whose songs Milton sonneted. I had always thought that\r\nno musician could do other than paint the lily in attempting to add\r\nmusic to the music of Tennyson's \"Bugle Song,\" but Hawley has come\r\ndangerously near satisfaction in the elfland faintness and dying\r\nclearness of his voices.\r\n\r\nHe has written two comic glees, one of which, \"They Kissed! I Saw Them\r\nDo It,\" has put thousands of people into the keenest mirth. It is a\r\nvocal scherzo for men's voices. It begins with a criminally lugubrious\r\nand thin colloquy, in which the bass dolefully informs the others:\r\n\"Beneath a shady tree they sat,\" to which the rest agree; \"He held\r\nher hand, she held his hat,\" which meets with general consent. Now we\r\nare told in stealthy gasps, \"I held my breath and lay right flat.\"\r\nSuddenly out of this thinness bursts a peal of richest harmony: \"They\r\nkissed! I saw them do it.\" It is repeated more lusciously still, and\r\nthen the basses and barytones mouth the gossip disapprovingly, and the\r\npoem continues with delicious raillery till it ends abruptly and\r\narchly: \"And they thought no one knew it!\"\r\n\r\nBesides these scherzos, Hawley has written a few religious part songs\r\nof a high order, particularly the noble \"Trisagion and Sanctus,\" with\r\nits \"Holy, Holy!\" now hushed in reverential awe and now pealing in\r\nexultant worship. But of all his songs, I like best his \"When Love is\r\nGone,\" fraught with calm intensity, and closing in beauty as\r\nineffable as a last glimmer of dying day.\r\n\r\nTo the stencil-plate chivalry of the lyrics of the ubiquitous F.E.\r\nWeatherby and John Oxenford, the song-status of England can blame a\r\ndeal of its stagnation. It is not often that these word-wringers have\r\nenticed American composers. One of the few victims is John Hyatt\r\nBrewer, who was born in Brooklyn, in 1856, and has lived there ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n[Music: When Love is gone.\r\n\r\n(_Soprano, or Tenor._)\r\n\r\nC.B. HAWLEY.\r\n\r\n    The mind has a thousand eyes,\r\n    The heart but one;\r\n    Yet the light of a whole life dies\r\n    When love is gone, when love is gone.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1894, by G. Schirmer.]\r\n\r\nBrewer made his debut as a six-year-old singer, and sang till his\r\nfourteenth year. A year later he was an organist in Brooklyn, where he\r\nhas held various positions in the same capacity ever since,\r\nadditionally busying himself as a teacher of voice, piano, organ, and\r\nharmony. His studies in piano and harmony were pursued under Rafael\r\nNavarro. Counterpoint, fugue, and composition he studied under Dudley\r\nBuck.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Brewer became the second tenor and accompanist of the Apollo\r\nClub, of which Mr. Buck is the director. He has conducted numerous\r\nvocal societies and an amateur orchestra.\r\n\r\nOf his cantatas, \"Hesperus\" is a work of the greatest promise and\r\nlarge performance.\r\n\r\nFor male voices Brewer has written a cantata called \"The Birth of\r\nLove.\" Its fiery ending is uncharacteristic, but the beautiful tenor\r\nsolo and an excellent bass song prove his forte to lie in the realm\r\nof tenderness. Brewer's music has little fondness for climaxes, but in\r\na tender pathos that is not tragedy, but a sort of lotos-eater's\r\ndreaminess and regret, he is congenially placed. Smoothness is one of\r\nhis best qualities.\r\n\r\nOut of a number of part songs for men, one should mark a vigorous\r\n\"Fisher's Song,\" a \"May Song,\" which has an effective \"barber's\r\nchord,\" and \"The Katydid,\" a witty realization of Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes' captivating poem. His \"Sensible Serenade\" has also an\r\nexcellent flow of wit. Both these songs should please glee clubs and\r\ntheir audiences.\r\n\r\nFor women's voices Brewer has written not a little. The best of these\r\nare \"Sea Shine,\" which is particularly mellow, and \"Treachery,\" a\r\nlove-scherzo.\r\n\r\nFor the violin there are two pieces: one, in the key of D, is a duet\r\nbetween the violin and the soprano voice of the piano. It is full of\r\ncharacteristic tenderness, full even of tears. It should find a good\r\nplace among those violin ballads of which Raff's Cavatina is the\r\nbest-known example. Another violin solo in A is more florid, but is\r\nwell managed. The two show a natural aptitude for composition for this\r\nfavorite of all instruments.\r\n\r\nFor full orchestra there is a suite, \"The Lady of the Lake,\" also\r\narranged, for piano and organ. It is smooth and well-tinted. A sextet\r\nfor strings and flute has been played with favor.\r\n\r\nBrewer's chief success lies along lines of least resistance, one might\r\nsay. His Album of Songs (op. 27) is a case in point. Of the subtle and\r\ninevitable \"Du bist wie eine Blume,\" he makes nothing, and \"The\r\nViolet\" forces an unfortunate contrast with Mozart's idyl to the same\r\nwords. But \"Meadow Sweet\" is simply iridescent with cheer, a most\r\nunusually sweet song, and \"The Heart's Rest\" is of equal perfection.\r\n\r\nThe best-abused composer in America is doubtless Reginald de Koven.\r\nHis great popularity has attracted the search-light of minute\r\ncriticism to him, and his accomplishments are such as do not well\r\nendure the fierce white light that beats upon the throne. The sin of\r\nover-vivid reminiscence is the one most persistently imputed to him,\r\nand not without cause. While I see no reason to accuse him of\r\ndeliberate imitation, I think he is a little too loth to excise from\r\nhis music those things of his that prove on consideration to have been\r\nsaid or sung before him. Instead of crying, \"_Pereant qui ante nos\r\nnostra cantaverunt_,\" he believes in a live-and-let-live policy. But\r\nah, if De Koven were the only composer whose eraser does not evict all\r\nthat his memory installs!\r\n\r\nDe Koven was born at Middletown, Conn., in 1859, and enjoyed unusual\r\nadvantages for musical study abroad. At the age of eleven, he was\r\ntaken to Europe, where he lived for twelve years. At Oxford he earned\r\na degree with honors. His musical instructors include Speidel, Lebert,\r\nand Pruckner, at Stuttgart, Huff the contrapuntist at Frankfort, and\r\nVannucini, who taught him singing, at Florence. He made also a\r\nspecial study of light opera under Genee and Von Suppe. He made\r\nChicago his home in 1882, afterward moving to New York, where he\r\nserved as a musical critic on one of the daily papers for many years.\r\n\r\nDe Koven has been chief purveyor of comic opera to his generation, and\r\nfor so ideal a work as \"Robin Hood,\" and such pleasing constructions\r\nas parts of his other operas (\"Don Quixote,\" \"The Fencing Master,\"\r\n\"The Highwayman,\" for instance), one ought to be grateful, especially\r\nas his music has always a certain elegance and freedom from vulgarity.\r\n\r\nOf his ballads, \"Oh, Promise Me\" has a few opening notes that remind\r\none of \"Musica Proibita,\" but it was a taking lyric that stuck in the\r\npublic heart. His setting of Eugene Field's \"Little Boy Blue\" is a\r\nwork of purest pathos and directness. His version of \"My Love is Like\r\na Red, Red Rose\" is among the best of its countless settings, and \"The\r\nFool of Pamperlune,\" the \"Indian Love Song,\" \"In June,\" and a few\r\nothers, are excellent ballad-writing.\r\n\r\nVictor Harris is one of the few that selected New York for a\r\nbirthplace. He was born here April 27, 1869, and attended the College\r\nof the City of New York, class of 1888. For several of his early years\r\nhe was well known as a boy-soprano, whence he graduated into what he\r\ncalls the \"usual career\" of organist, pianist, and teacher of the\r\nvoice. In 1895 and 1896 he acted as the assistant conductor to Anton\r\nSeidl in the Brighton Beach summer concerts. He learned harmony of\r\nFrederick Schilling.\r\n\r\nHarris is most widely known as an accompanist, and is one of the best\r\nin the country. But while the accompaniments he writes to his own\r\nsongs are carefully polished and well colored, they lack the show of\r\nindependence that one might expect from so unusual a master of their\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nExcept for an unpublished one-act operetta, \"Mlle. Maie et M. de\r\nSembre,\" and a few piano pieces, Harris has confined himself to the\r\nwriting of short songs. In his twenty-first year two of unequal merits\r\nwere published, \"The Fountains Mingle with the River\" being a taking\r\nmelody, but without distinction or originality, while \"Sweetheart\" has\r\nmuch more freedom from conventionality and inevitableness.\r\n\r\n[Music: To N.N.H.\r\n\r\nSong from Omar Khayyam.\r\n\r\nVICTOR HARRIS, Op. 16, No. 3.\r\n\r\n    Oh! threats of Hell and hopes of Paradise!\r\n    One thing at least is certain--\r\n    _This_ Life flies,\r\n    One thing is certain, and the rest is Lies!\r\n    The Flower that once has blown for ever, for ever dies.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1898, by Edward Schuberth & Co.]\r\n\r\nA later song, \"My Guest,\" shows an increase in elaboration, but\r\nfollows the florid school of Harrison Millard's once so popular\r\nrhapsody, \"Waiting.\" Five songs are grouped into opus 12, and they\r\nreach a much higher finish and a better tendency to make excursions\r\ninto other keys. They also show two of Harris' mannerisms, a constant\r\nrepetition of verbal phrases and a fondness for writing close,\r\nunbroken chords, in triplets or quartoles. \"A Melody\" is beautiful;\r\n\"Butterflies and Buttercups\" is the perfection of grace; \"I Know not\r\nif Moonlight or Starlight\" is a fine rapture, and \"A Disappointment\"\r\nis a dire tragedy, all about some young toadstools that thought they\r\nwere going to be mushrooms. For postlude two measures from the\r\ncantabile of Chopin's \"Funeral March\" are used with droll effect.\r\n\"Love, Hallo!\" is a headlong springtime passion. Two of his latest\r\nsongs are \"Forever and a Day,\" with many original touches, and a\r\n\"Song from Omar Khayyam,\" which is made of some of the most cynical of\r\nthe tent-maker's quatrains. Harris has given them all their power and\r\nbitterness till the last line, \"The flower that once has blown forever\r\ndies,\" which is written with rare beauty. \"A Night-song\" is possibly\r\nhis best work; it is full of colors, originalities, and lyric\r\nqualities. Opus 13 contains six songs: \"Music when Soft Voices Die\"\r\nhas many uncommon and effective intervals; \"The Flower of Oblivion\" is\r\nmore dramatic than usual, employs discords boldly, and gives the\r\naccompaniment more individuality than before; \"A Song of Four\r\nSeasons\" is a delicious morsel of gaiety, and \"Love within the Lover's\r\nBreast\" is a superb song. Harris has written some choric works for men\r\nand women also. They show commendable attention to all the voice\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent figures in American musical history has been\r\nDr. William Mason. He was born in Boston, January 24, 1829, and was\r\nthe son of Lowell Mason, that pioneer in American composition. Dr.\r\nWilliam Mason studied in Boston, and in Germany under Moscheles,\r\nHauptmann, Richter, and Liszt. His success in concerts abroad and here\r\ngave prestige to his philosophy of technic, and his books on method\r\nhave taken the very highest rank.\r\n\r\nHis pedagogical attainments have overshadowed his composition, but he\r\nhas written some excellent music. As he has been an educational force\r\nin classical music, so his compositions show the severe pursuit of\r\nclassic forms and ideas. His work is, therefore, rather ingenious than\r\ninspired, and intellectual rather than emotional. Yale made him Doctor\r\nof Music in 1872.\r\n\r\nAnother composer whose studies in technic have left him only a little\r\ninclination for creation is Albert Ross Parsons, who was born at\r\nSandusky, O., September 16, 1847. He studied in Buffalo, and in New\r\nYork under Ritter. Then he went to Germany, where he had a remarkably\r\nthorough schooling under Moscheles, Reinecke, Richter, Paul, Taussig,\r\nKullak, and others. Returning to this country, he has busied himself\r\nas organist, teacher, and an editor of musical works. What little\r\nmusic he has composed shows the fruit of his erudition in its\r\ncorrectness.\r\n\r\nSuch men as Doctor Mason and Mr. Parsons, though they add little to\r\nthe volume of composition,--a thing for which any one should be\r\nthanked on some considerations,--yet add great dignity to their\r\nprofession in this country.\r\n\r\nArthur, a younger brother of Ethelbert Nevin, shows many of the\r\nNevinian traits of lyric energy and harmonic color in his songs. He\r\nwas born at Sewickley, Pa., in 1871. Until he was eighteen he had\r\nneither interest nor knowledge in music. In 1891 he began a four\r\nyears' course in Boston, going thence to Berlin, where his masters\r\nwere Klindworth and Boise. A book of four graceful \"May Sketches\" has\r\nbeen published, \"Pierrot's Guitar\" being especially ingenious. There\r\nare two published songs, \"Were I a Tone\" and \"In Dreams,\" both\r\nemotionally rich. In manuscript are a fine song, \"Free as the Tossing\r\nSea,\" and a well-devised trio.\r\n\r\nA successful writer of songs is C. Whitney Coombs. He was born in\r\nMaine, in 1864, and went abroad at the age of fourteen. He studied the\r\npiano with Speidel, and composition with Seiffritz, in Stuttgart, for\r\nfive years, and pursued his studies later in Dresden under Draessecke,\r\nJanssen, and John. In 1887 he became organist at the American Church\r\nin that city, returning to America in 1891, since which time he has\r\nbeen an organist in New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 his publication begins with \"My Love,\" an excellent lilt on\r\nlines from the Arabian. Among his many songs a few should be noted:\r\nthe \"Song of a Summer Night\" is brilliant and poetic, and \"Alone\" is\r\nmarked by some beautiful contramelodic effects; his \"Indian Serenade\"\r\nis a gracious work.\r\n\r\nJ. Remington Fairlamb has been a prolific composer. He was born at\r\nPhiladelphia, and at fourteen was a church organist. He studied at the\r\nParis Conservatoire and in Italy; was appointed consul at Zurich by\r\nPresident Lincoln, and while in Stuttgart was decorated by the King of\r\nWurtemburg with the \"Great Gold Medal of Art and Science\" for a Te\r\nDeum for double chorus and orchestra. Of Fairlamb's compositions, some\r\ntwo hundred have been published, including much sacred music and parts\r\nof two operas. A grand opera, \"Leonello,\" in five acts, and a mass are\r\nin manuscript.\r\n\r\nFrank Seymour Hastings has found in music a pleasant avocation from\r\nfinance, and written various graceful songs. He has been active, too,\r\nin the effort to secure a proper production of grand opera in English.\r\n\r\nDr. John M. Loretz, of Brooklyn, is a veteran composer, and has passed\r\nhis opus 200. He has written much sacred music and several comic\r\noperas.\r\n\r\nA prominent figure in New York music, though only an occasional\r\ncomposer, is Louis Raphael Dressler, one of the six charter members of\r\nthe Manuscript Society, and long its treasurer. His father was William\r\nDressler, one of the leading musicians of the earlier New York, where\r\nMr. Dressler was born, in 1861. Dressier studied with his father, and\r\ninherited his ability as a professional accompanist and conductor. He\r\nwas the first to produce amateur performances of opera in New York.\r\nHis songs are marked with sincerity and spontaneity.\r\n\r\nRichard Henry Warren has been the organist at St. Bartholomew's since\r\n1886, and the composer of much religious music in which both skill and\r\nfeeling are present. Among his more important works are two complete\r\nservices, a scene for barytone solo, male chorus, and orchestra,\r\ncalled \"Ticonderoga,\" and a powerful Christmas anthem. Warren has\r\nwritten also various operettas, in which he shows a particular grasp\r\nof instrumentation, and an ability to give new turns of expression to\r\nhis songs, while keeping them smooth and singable. An unpublished\r\nshort song of his, \"When the Birds Go North,\" is a remarkably\r\nbeautiful work, showing an aptitude that should be more cultivated.\r\n\r\nWarren was born at Albany, September 17, 1859. He is a son and pupil\r\nof George W. Warren, the distinguished organist. He went to Europe in\r\n1880, and again in 1886, for study and observation. He was the\r\norganizer and conductor of the Church Choral Society, which gave\r\nvarious important religious works their first production in New York,\r\nand, in some cases, their first hearing in America, notably, Dvorak's\r\nRequiem Mass, Gounod's \"Mors et Vita,\" Liszt's Thirteenth Psalm,\r\nSaint-Saens' \"The Heavens Declare,\" Villiers Stanford's \"God is Our\r\nHope and Strength,\" and Mackenzie's \"Veni, Creator Spiritus.\" Horatio\r\nParker's \"Hora Novissima\" was composed for this society, and\r\nChadwick's \"Phoenix Expirans\" given its first New York performance.\r\n\r\nA prominent organist and teacher is Smith N. Penfield, who has also\r\nfound time for the composition of numerous scholarly works, notably,\r\nan overture for full orchestra, an orchestral setting of the\r\neighteenth psalm, a string quartette, and many pieces for the organ,\r\nvoice, and piano. His tuition has been remarkably thorough. Born in\r\nOberlin, Ohio, April 4, 1837, he studied the piano in Germany with\r\nMoscheles, Papperitz, and Reinecke, the organ with Richter,\r\ncomposition, counterpoint, and fugue with Reinecke and Hauptmann. He\r\nhad also a period of study in Paris.\r\n\r\nAnother organist of distinction is Frank Taft, who is also a conductor\r\nand a composer. His most important work is a \"Marche Symphonique,\"\r\nwhich was performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was born in\r\nEast Bloomfield, New York, and had his education entirely in this\r\ncountry, studying the organ with Clarence Eddy, and theory with\r\nFrederic Grant Gleason.\r\n\r\nA young composer of many graceful songs is Charles Fonteyn Manney, who\r\nwas born in Brooklyn in 1872, and studied theory with William Arms\r\nFisher in New York, and later with J. Wallace Goodrich at Boston. His\r\nmost original song is \"Orpheus with His Lute,\" which reproduces the\r\nquaint and fascinating gaucheries of the text with singular charm. He\r\nhas also set various songs of Heine's to music, and a short cantata\r\nfor Easter, \"The Resurrection.\"\r\n\r\nAn ability that is strongly individual is that of Arthur Farwell,\r\nwhose first teacher in theory was Homer A. Norris, and who later\r\nstudied under Humperdinck in Germany. Among his works are an elaborate\r\nballade for piano and violin, a setting of Shelley's \"Indian\r\nSerenade,\" and four folk-songs to words by Johanna Ambrosius, the\r\npeasant genius of Germany. Among others of his published songs is\r\n\"Strow Poppy Buds,\" a strikingly original composition.\r\n\r\nA writer of numerous elegant trifles and of a serious symphony is\r\nHarry Patterson Hopkins, who was born in Baltimore, and graduated at\r\nthe Peabody Institute in 1896, receiving the diploma for distinguished\r\nmusicianship. The same year he went to Bohemia, and studied with\r\nDvorak. He returned to America to assist in the production of one of\r\nhis compositions by Anton Seidl.\r\n\r\nVery thorough was the foreign training of Carl V. Lachmund, whose\r\n\"Japanese Overture\" has been produced under the direction of Thomas\r\nand Seidl, in the former case at a concert of that society at which\r\nmany important native works have had their only hearing, the Music\r\nTeachers' National Association. Lachmund was born at Booneville, Mo.,\r\nin 1854. At the age of thirteen he began his tuition at Cologne, under\r\nHeller, Jensen, and Seiss; later he went to Berlin to study with the\r\nScharwenkas, Kiel, and Moskowski. He had also four years of Liszt's\r\ntraining at Weimar. A trio for harp, violin, and 'cello was played by\r\nthe Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and a concert prelude for the piano\r\nwas much played in concerts in Germany. Before returning to America,\r\nLachmund was for a time connected with the opera at Cologne.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Boston Colony._\r\n\r\nTo the composer potentially a writer of grand operas, but barred out\r\nby the absolute lack of opening here, the dramatic ballad should offer\r\nan attractive form. Such works as Schubert's \"Erl-King\" show what can\r\nbe done. Henry Holden Huss has made some interesting experiments, and\r\nFred. Field Bullard has tried the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK FIELD BULLARD.]\r\n\r\nBullard's setting of Tennyson's almost lurid melodrama in six stanzas,\r\n\"The Sisters,\" has caught the bitter mixture of love and hate, and\r\navoided claptrap climaxes most impressively.\r\n\r\n[Music: HYMN OF PAN.\r\n\r\nWords by\r\nPERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY.\r\n\r\nMusic by\r\nFRED.

Bullard has set some of\r\nShelley's lyrics for voice and harp or piano, in opus 17. \"From Dreams\r\nof Thee\" gets a delicious quaintness of accompaniment, while the \"Hymn\r\nof Pan\" shows a tremendous savagery and uncouthness, with strange and\r\nstubborn harmonies. Full of the same roborific virility are his\r\nsettings to the songs of Richard Hovey's writing, \"Here's a Health to\r\nThee, Roberts,\" \"Barney McGee,\" and the \"Stein Song.\" These songs have\r\nan exuberance of the roistering spirit, along with a competence of\r\nmusicianship that lifts them above any comparison with the average\r\nballadry. Similarly \"The Sword of Ferrara,\" with its hidalgic pride,\r\nand \"The Indifferent Mariner,\" and the drinking-song, \"The Best of All\r\nGood Company,\" are all what Horace Greeley would have called \"mighty\r\ninteresting.\" Not long ago I would have wagered my head against a\r\nhand-saw, that no writer of this time could write a canon with\r\nspontaneity. But then I had not seen Bullard's three duets in canon\r\nform. He has chosen his words so happily and expressed them so easily,\r\nand with such arch raillery, that the duets are delicious. Of equal\r\ngaiety is \"The Lass of Norwich Town,\" which, with its violin\r\nobbligato, won a prize in the _Musical Record_ competition of 1899.\r\n\r\nBullard was born at Boston, in 1864. He studied chemistry at first,\r\nbut the claims of music on his interest were too great, and in 1888 he\r\nwent to Munich, where he studied with Josef Rheinberger. After four\r\nyears of European life he returned to Boston, where he has taught\r\nharmony and counterpoint along rather original lines. He is a writer\r\nwith ideas and resources that give promise of a large future. His\r\nscholarship has not led him away from individuality. He is especially\r\nlikely to give unexpected turns of expression, little bits of\r\nprogrammism rather incompatible with the ballad form most of his songs\r\ntake. The chief fault with his work is the prevailing dun-ness of his\r\nharmonies. They have not felt the impressionistic revolt from the old\r\nbituminous school. But in partial compensation for this bleakness is a\r\nfine ruggedness.\r\n\r\nOf his other published songs, \"At Daybreak\" shows a beautiful fervor\r\nof repression. \"On the Way\" is redeemed by a particularly stirring\r\nfinish. In opus 8, \"A Prayer\" is begun in D minor and ended in D\r\nmajor, with a strong effect of sudden exaltation from gloom. \"The\r\nSinger\" begins also in sombre style with unusual and abrupt\r\nmodulations, and ends in a bright major. \"The Hermit\" is likewise\r\ngrim, but is broad and deep. It uses a hint of \"Old Hundred\" in the\r\naccompaniment.\r\n\r\nOpus 11 couples two dramatic ballads. In this form of condensed drama\r\nis a too-little occupied field of composition, and Bullard has written\r\nsome part songs, of which \"In the Merry Month of May,\" \"Her Scuttle\r\nHat,\" and \"The Water Song\" are worth mentioning. \"O Stern Old Land\" is\r\na rather bathetic candidate for the national hymnship. But his \"War\r\nSong of Gamelbar,\" for male voices, is really a masterwork.\r\nHarmonists insist on so much closer compliance with rules for\r\nsmoothness in vocal compositions than in instrumental work, that the\r\nusual composer gives himself very little liberty here. Bullard,\r\nhowever, has found the right occasion for wild dissonances, and has\r\ndared to use them. The effect is one of terrific power. This, his\r\n\"Song of Pan\" and \"The Sisters\" give him a place apart from the rest\r\nof native song-writers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOMER A. NORRIS.]\r\n\r\nWith all reverence for German music, it has been too much inclined of\r\nlate to domineer the rest of the world, especially America. A useful\r\ncounter-influence is that of Homer A. Norris, who has stepped out of\r\nthe crowd flying to Munich and neighboring places, and profited by\r\nParisian harmonic methods.\r\n\r\nHis book, \"Practical Harmony,\" imparts a, to us, novel method of\r\ndisarming the bugaboo of altered chords of many of its notorious\r\nterrors. He also attacks the pedantry of music \"so constructed that it\r\nappeals to the eye rather than the ear,--paper-work,\" a most\r\npraiseworthy assault on what is possibly the heaviest incubus on\r\ninspiration. In a later work on \"Counterpoint\" he used for chapter\r\nheadings Greek vases and other decorative designs, to stimulate the\r\nideal of counterpoint as a unified complexity of graceful contours.\r\n\r\nNorris was born in Wayne, Me., and became an organist at an early\r\nage. His chief interest has been, however, in the theory of music, and\r\nhe studied with G.W. Marston, F.W. Hale, and G.W. Chadwick, as well\r\nas Emery. In deciding upon foreign study he was inspired to choose\r\nFrance instead of Germany. This has given him a distinct place.\r\n\r\nAfter studying in Paris for four years under Dubois, Godard, Guilmant,\r\nand Gigout, he made his home in Boston, where he has since confined\r\nhimself to the teaching of composition.\r\n\r\nAs yet Mr. Norris has composed little, and that little is done on\r\nsimple lines, but the simplicity is deep, and the harmonies, without\r\nbeing bizarre, are wonderfully mellow.\r\n\r\nHis first song, \"Rock-a-bye, Baby,\" he sold for twelve printed copies,\r\nand it is said to have had a larger sale than any cradle-song ever\r\npublished in this country. His song, \"Protestations,\" is tender, and\r\nhas a violin obbligato that is really more important than the voice\r\npart. The song, \"Parting,\" is wild with passion, and bases a superb\r\nmelody on a fitting harmonic structure. I consider \"Twilight\" one of\r\nthe best American songs. It gets some unusual effects with intervals\r\nof tenths and ninths, and shows a remarkable depth of emotion.\r\n\r\nIn the larger forms he has done a concert overture, \"Zoroaster\"\r\n(which, judging from an outline, promises many striking effects), and\r\na cantata, \"Nain,\" which has the sin of over-repetition of words, but\r\nis otherwise marked with telling pathos and occasional outbursts of\r\nintensely dramatic feeling.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his most original work is seen in his book of \"Four Songs for\r\nMezzo-Voice.\" The first is Kipling's \"O Mother Mine,\" with harshnesses\r\nfollowed by tenderest musings; the second is a noble song, \"Peace,\"\r\nwith an accompaniment consisting entirely of the slowly descending\r\nscale of C major; a high-colored lilt, \"The World and a Day,\" is\r\nfollowed by a Maeterlinckian recitative of the most melting pathos.\r\nThis book is another substantiation of my belief that America is\r\nwriting the best of the songs of to-day.\r\n\r\nOne of the best-esteemed musicians in Boston, G.E. Whiting has\r\ndevoted more of his interest to his career as virtuoso on the organ\r\nthan to composition. Not many of such works as he has found time to\r\nwrite have been printed. These include an organ sonata, a number of\r\norgan pieces, a book of studies for the organ, six songs, and three\r\ncantatas for solos, chorus, and orchestra, \"A Tale of the Viking,\"\r\n\"Dream Pictures,\" and \"A Midnight Cantata.\"\r\n\r\nWhiting was born at Holliston, Mass., September 14, 1842. At the age\r\nof five, he began the study of music with his brother. At the age of\r\nfifteen, he moved to Hartford, Conn., where he succeeded Dudley Buck\r\nas organist of one of the churches. Here he founded the Beethoven\r\nSociety. At the age of twenty he went to Boston, and after studying\r\nwith Morgan, went to Liverpool, and studied the organ under William\r\nThomas Best. Later he made a second pilgrimage to Europe, and studied\r\nunder Radeck.\r\n\r\nFor many years he has lived in Boston as a teacher of music and\r\nperformer upon the organ. In manuscript are a number of works which I\r\nhave not had the privilege of seeing: two masses for chorus,\r\norchestra, and organ, a concert overture, a concerto, a sonata, a\r\nfantasy and fugue, a fantasy and three etudes, a suite for 'cello and\r\npiano, and a setting of Longfellow's \"Golden Legend,\" which won two\r\nvotes out of five in the thousand dollar musical festival of 1897, the\r\nprize being awarded to Dudley Buck.\r\n\r\n[Music: Peace.\r\n\r\nEDWARD ROWLAND SILL.\r\n\r\nHOMER A.

Krehbiel in 1892 recorded the opinion that\r\nthey \"entitled him to a position among the foremost musicians in this\r\ncountry.\" He is an uncle of Arthur Whiting.\r\n\r\nG.W. Marston's setting of the omnipresent \"Du bist wie eine Blume\" is\r\nreally one of the very best Heine's poem has ever had. Possibly it is\r\nthe best of all the American settings. His \"There Was an Aged Monarch\"\r\nis seriously deserving of the frankest comparison with Grieg's\r\ntreatment of the same _Lied_. It is interesting to note the radical\r\ndifference of their attitudes toward it. Grieg writes in a folk-tone\r\nthat is severe to the point of grimness. He is right because it is\r\n_ein altes Liedchen_, and Heine's handling of it is also kept\r\noutwardly cold. But Marston has rendered the song into music of the\r\nrichest harmony and fullest pathos. He is right, also, because he has\r\ninterpreted the undercurrent of the story.\r\n\r\nBodenstedt's ubiquitous lyric, \"Wenn der Fruehling auf die Berge\r\nsteigt,\" which rivals \"Du bist wie eine Blume\" in the favor of\r\ncomposers, has gathered Marston also into its net. He gives it a\r\nclimax that fairly sweeps one off his feet, though one might wish that\r\nthe following and final phrase had not forsaken the rich harmonies of\r\nthe climax so completely.\r\n\r\nThis song is the first of a \"Song Album\" for sopranos, published in\r\n1890. In this group the accompaniments all receive an attention that\r\ngives them meaning without obtrusiveness. \"The Duet\" is a delicious\r\nmarriage of the song of a girl and the accompanying rapture of a bird.\r\n\r\nA captivating little florid figure in the accompaniment of a setting\r\nof \"Im wunderschoenen Monat Mai\" gives the song worth. \"On the Water\"\r\nis profound with sombreness and big simplicity. \"The Boat of My Lover\"\r\nis quaintly delightful.\r\n\r\nMarston was born in Massachusetts, at the little town of Sandwich, in\r\n1840. He studied there, and later at Portland, Me., with John W.\r\nTufts, and has made two pilgrimages to Europe for instruction. He\r\nplayed the organ in his native town at the age of fifteen, and since\r\nfinishing his studies has lived at Portland, teaching the piano,\r\norgan, and harmony. From the start his songs caught popularity, and\r\nwere much sung in concert.\r\n\r\nMarston has written a sacred dramatic cantata, \"David,\" and a large\r\namount of church music that is very widely used. He has written also a\r\nset of quartettes and trios for women's voices, and quartettes for\r\nmen's voices.\r\n\r\nPossibly his best-known song has been his \"Could Ye Come Back to Me,\r\nDouglas,\" which Mrs. Craik called the best of all her poem's many\r\nsettings.\r\n\r\nOnly Marston's later piano pieces are really _klaviermaessig_. So fine\r\na work as his \"Gavotte in B Minor\" has no need to consider the\r\nresources of the modern instrument. It has a color scheme of much\r\noriginality, though it is marred by over-repetition. \"A Night in\r\nSpain\" is a dashing reminiscence, not without Spanish spirit, and an\r\n\"Album Leaf\" is a divertissement of contagious enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of G.W. Marston]\r\n\r\nAriel's songs, from \"The Tempest,\" are given a piano interpretation\r\nthat reaches a high plane. There is a storm prologue which suggests,\r\nin excellent harmonies, the distant mutter of the storm rather than a\r\npiano-gutting tornado. \"Full Fathoms Five Thy Father Lies\" is a\r\nreverie of wonderful depth and originality, with a delicious variation\r\non the good old-fashioned cadence. Thence it works up into an\r\nimmensely powerful close. A dance, \"Foot it Featly,\" follows. It is\r\nsprightly, and contains a fetching cadenza.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prolific writers of American song is Clayton Johns. He\r\nis almost always pleasing and polished. While he is not at all\r\nrevolutionary, he has a certain individuality of ease, and lyric\r\nquality without storm or stress of passion. Thus his settings of seven\r\n\"Wanderlieder\" by Uhland have all the spirit of the road except\r\nruggedness.\r\n\r\nHis setting of \"Du bist wie eine Blume\" is extremely tender and sweet.\r\n\r\nTwo of Johns' best successes have been settings of Egyptian subjects:\r\n\"Were I a Prince Egyptian\" and Arlo Bates' fine lyric, \"No Lotus\r\nFlower on Ganges Borne.\" The latter is a superb song of unusual fire,\r\nwith a strong effect at the end, the voice ceasing at a deceptive\r\ncadence, while the accompaniment sweeps on to its destiny in the\r\noriginal key. He has also found a congenial subject in Austin Dobson's\r\n\"The Rose and the Gardener.\" He gets for a moment far from its florid\r\ngrace in \"I Looked within My Soul,\" which has an unwonted bigness, and\r\nis a genuine _Lied_.\r\n\r\nIn later years Johns' songs have been brought out in little albums,\r\nvery artistically got up, especially for music (which has been\r\nheinously printed, as a rule, in this country). These albums include\r\nthree skilfully written \"English Songs,\" and three \"French Songs,\"\r\n\"Soupir\" taking the form of melodic recitative. Opus 19 is a group of\r\n\"Wonder Songs,\" which interpret Oliver Herford's quaint conceits\r\ncapitally.\r\n\r\nOpus 26 collects nine songs, of which \"Princess Pretty Eyes\" is\r\nfascinatingly archaic. It is good to see him setting two such remotely\r\nkindred spirits as Herrick and Emily Dickinson. The latter has hardly\r\nbeen discovered by composers, and the former is too much neglected.\r\n\r\nJohns has also written a few part songs and some instrumental works,\r\nwhich maintain his characteristics. A delightful \"Canzone,\" a happy\r\n\"Promenade,\" and \"Mazurka\" are to be mentioned, and a number of pieces\r\nfor violin and piano, among them a finely built intermezzo, a\r\nberceuse, a romanza that should be highly effective, and a witty\r\nscherzino. He has written for strings a berceuse and a scherzino,\r\nwhich have been played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and certain\r\npart songs, as well as a chorus for female voices and string\r\norchestra, have been sung in London.\r\n\r\nJohns was born at New Castle, Del., November 24, 1857, of American\r\nparents. Though at first a student of architecture, he gave this up\r\nfor music, and studied at Boston under Wm. F. Apthorp, J.K. Paine,\r\nand W.H. Sherwood, after which he went to Berlin, where he studied\r\nunder Kiel, Grabau, Raif, and Franz Rummel. In 1884 he made Boston his\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nIf San Francisco had found some way of retaining the composers she has\r\nproduced, she would have a very respectable colony. Among the others\r\nwho have come east to grow up with music is William Arms Fisher, who\r\nwas born in San Francisco, April 27, 1861. The two composers from whom\r\nhe derives his name, Joshua Fisher and William Arms, settled in\r\nMassachusetts colony in the seventeenth century. He studied harmony,\r\norgan, and piano with John P. Morgan. After devoting some years to\r\nbusiness, he committed his life to music, and in 1890 came to New\r\nYork, where he studied singing. Later he went to London to continue\r\nhis vocal studies. Returning to New York, he took up counterpoint and\r\nfugue with Horatio W. Parker, and composition and instrumentation with\r\nDvorak. After teaching harmony for several years, he went to Boston,\r\nwhere he now lives. His work has been almost altogether the\r\ncomposition of songs. A notable feature of his numerous publications\r\nis their agreeable diversion from the usual practice of composers,\r\nwhich is to write lyrics of wide range and high pitch. Nearly all his\r\nsongs are written for the average voice.\r\n\r\nHis first opus contains a setting of \"Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt,\"\r\nwhich I like better than the banal version Tschaikowski made of the\r\nsame words. The third opus contains three songs to Shelley's words.\r\nThey show something of the intellectual emotion of the poet. The first\r\nwork, \"A Widow Bird Sate Mourning,\" is hardly lyrical; \"My Coursers\r\nAre Fed with the Lightning\" is a stout piece of writing, but the\r\ninspired highfalutin of the words would be trying upon one who arose\r\nto sing the song before an audience. This, by the way, is a point\r\nrarely considered by the unsuccessful composers, and the words which\r\nthe singer is expected to declare to an ordinary audience are\r\nsometimes astounding. The third Shelley setting, \"The World's\r\nWanderer,\" is more congenial to song.\r\n\r\nOpus 5 is entitled \"Songs without Tears.\" These are for a bass voice,\r\nand by all odds the best of his songs. An appropriate setting is\r\nEdmund Clarence Stedman's \"Falstaff's Song,\" a noteworthy lyric of\r\ntoss-pot moralization on death. His song of \"Joy\" is exuberant with\r\nspring gaiety, and some of his best manner is seen in his \"Elegie,\"\r\nfor violin and piano. He has also written a deal of church song.\r\n\r\nA venerable and distinguished teacher and composer is James C.D.\r\nParker, who was born at Boston, in 1828, and graduated from Harvard in\r\n1848. He at first studied law, but was soon turned to music, and\r\nstudied for three years in Europe under Richter, Plaidy, Hauptmann,\r\nMoscheles, Rietz, and Becker. He graduated from the conservatory at\r\nLeipzig, and returned to Boston in 1845.\r\n\r\nHis \"Redemption Hymn\" is one of his most important works, and was\r\nproduced in Boston by the Haendel and Haydn Society in 1877. He also\r\ncomposed other works for orchestra and chorus, and many brilliant\r\npiano compositions.\r\n\r\nAn interesting method of writing duets is that employed in the\r\n\"Children's Festival,\" by Charles Dennee. The pupil plays in some\r\nplaces the primo, and in others the secondo, his part being written\r\nvery simply, while the part to be played by the teacher is written\r\nwith considerable elaboration, so that the general effect is not so\r\nnarcotic as usual with duets for children. Dennee has written, among\r\nmany works of little specific gravity, a \"Suite Moderne\" of much\r\nskill, a suite for string orchestra, an overture and sonatas for the\r\npiano and for the violin and piano, as well as various comic operas.\r\nHe was born in Oswego, N.Y., September 1, 1863, and studied\r\ncomposition with Stephen A. Emery.\r\n\r\nA composer of a genial gaiety, one who has written a good minuet and\r\nan \"Evening Song\" that is not morose, is Benjamin Lincoln Whelpley,\r\nwho was born at Eastport, Me., October 23, 1863, and studied the piano\r\nat Boston with B.J. Lang, and composition with Sidney Homer and\r\nothers. He also studied in Paris for a time in 1890. He has written a\r\n\"Dance of the Gnomes,\" that is characteristic and brilliantly droll,\r\nand a piano piece, called \"Under Bright Skies,\" which has the panoply\r\nand progress of a sunlit cavalcade.\r\n\r\nErnest Osgood Hiler has written some good music for the violin, a\r\nbook of songs for children, \"Cloud, Field, and Flower,\" and some\r\nsacred music. He studied in Germany for two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chicago Colony._\r\n\r\nMost prominent among Chicago's composers is doubtless Frederic Grant\r\nGleason, who has written in the large forms with distinguished\r\nsuccess. The Thomas Orchestra has performed a number of his works,\r\nwhich is an excellent praise, because Thomas, who has done so much for\r\nAmerican audiences, has worried himself little about the American\r\ncomposer. At the World's Fair, which was, in some ways, the artistic\r\nbirthday of Chicago, and possibly the most important artistic event in\r\nour national history, some of Gleason's works were performed by\r\nThomas' organization, among them the _Vorspiel_ to an opera, \"Otho\r\nVisconti\" (op. 7), for which Gleason wrote both words and music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERIC GRANT GLEASON.]\r\n\r\nThis _Vorspiel_, like that to \"Lohengrin,\" is short and delicate. It\r\nbegins ravishingly with flutes and clarinets and four violins,\r\npianissimo, followed by a blare of brass. After this introductory\r\nperiod the work runs through tenderly contemplative musing to the end,\r\nin which, again, the only strings are the four violins, though here\r\nthey are accompanied by the brass and wood-winds and tympani, the\r\ncymbals being gently tapped with drumsticks. The introduction to the\r\nthird act of the opera is more lyrical, but not so fine. Another opera\r\nis \"Montezuma\" (op. 16). Gleason is again his own librettist. Of this\r\nopera I have been privileged to see the complete piano score, and\r\nmuch of the orchestral.\r\n\r\n[Music: Montezuma, Act III, Introduction\r\n\r\nFrederic Grant Gleason\r\n\r\nEXCERPT FROM AN ORCHESTRAL SCORE BY MR. GLEASON.]\r\n\r\nIn the first act Guatemozin, who has been exiled by Montezuma, appears\r\ndisguised as an ancient minstrel and sings prophetically of the coming\r\nof a god of peace and love to supplant the terrible idol that demands\r\nhuman sacrifice. This superbly written aria provokes from the\r\nterrified idolaters a chorus of fear and reproach that is strongly\r\neffective. The next act begins with an elaborate aria followed by a\r\nlove duet of much beauty. A heavily scored priests' march is one of\r\nthe chief numbers, and like most marches written by the unco'\r\nlearned, it is a grain of martial melody in a bushel of trumpet\r\nfigures and preparation. The Wagnerian _leit-motif_ idea is adopted in\r\nthis and other works of his, and the chief objection to his writing is\r\nits too great fidelity to the Wagnerian manner,--notably in the use of\r\nsuspensions and passing-notes,--otherwise he is a very powerful\r\nharmonist and an instrumenter of rare sophistication. A soprano aria\r\nwith orchestral accompaniment has been taken from the opera and sung\r\nin concert with strong effect.\r\n\r\nAnother work played at the World's Fair by Thomas, is a \"Processional\r\nof the Holy Grail.\" It is scored elaborately, but is rather brilliant\r\nthan large. It complimentarily introduces a hint or two of Wagner's\r\nGrail motif.\r\n\r\nThe symphonic poem, \"Edris,\" was also performed by the Thomas\r\nOrchestra. It is based upon Marie Corelli's novel, \"Ardath,\" which\r\ngives opportunity for much programmism, but of a mystical highly\r\ncolored sort for which music is especially competent. It makes use of\r\na number of remarkably beautiful motives. One effect much commented\r\nupon was a succession of fifths in the bass, used legitimately enough\r\nto express a dreariness of earth.\r\n\r\nThis provoked from that conservative of conservatives, the music\r\ncopyist, a patronizing annotation, \"Quinten!\" to which Gleason added\r\n\"Gewiss!\" A series of augmented triads, smoothly manipulated, was\r\nanother curiosity of the score.\r\n\r\nPossibly Gleason's happiest work is his exquisite music for that most\r\nexquisite of American poems, \"The Culprit Fay.\" It is described in\r\ndetail in Upton's \"Standard Cantatas,\" and liberally quoted from in\r\nGoodrich' \"Musical Analysis.\" While I have seen both the piano and\r\norchestral scores of this work (op. 15), and have seen much beauty in\r\nthem, my space compels me to refer the curious reader to either of\r\nthese most recommendable books.\r\n\r\nGleason has had an unusual schooling. He was born in Middletown,\r\nConn., in 1848. His parents were musical, and when at sixteen he wrote\r\na small matter of two oratorios without previous instruction, they put\r\nhim to study under Dudley Buck. From his tuition he graduated to\r\nGermany, and to such teachers as Moscheles, Richter, Plaidy, Lobe,\r\nRaif, Taussig, and Weitzmann. He studied in England after that, and\r\nreturned again to Germany. When he re-appeared in America he remained\r\na while at Hartford, Conn., whence he went to Chicago in 1876. He has\r\nlived there since, working at teaching and composition, and acting as\r\nmusical critic of the Chicago _Tribune_. An unusually gifted body of\r\ncritics, dramatic, musical, and literary, has worked upon the Chicago\r\nnewspapers, and Gleason has been prominent among them.\r\n\r\nAmong other important compositions of his are a symphonic cantata,\r\n\"The Auditorium Festival Ode,\" sung at the dedication of the Chicago\r\nAuditorium by a chorus of five hundred; sketches for orchestra, a\r\npiano concerto, organ music, and songs.\r\n\r\nAs is shown by the two or three vocal works of his that I have seen,\r\nGleason is less successful as a melodist than as a harmonist. But in\r\nthis latter capacity he is gifted indeed, and is peculiarly fitted to\r\nfurnish forth with music Ebling's \"Lobgesang auf die Harmonie.\" In his\r\nsetting of this poem he has used a soprano and a barytone solo with male\r\nchorus and orchestra. The harmonic structure throughout is superb in all\r\nthe various virtues ascribed to harmony. The ending is magnificent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM H. SHERWOOD.]\r\n\r\nA work completed December, 1899, for production by the Thomas\r\nOrchestra, is a symphonic poem called \"The Song of Life,\" with this\r\nmotto from Swinburne:\r\n\r\n    \"They have the night, who had, like us, the day;\r\n    We whom the day binds shall have night as they;\r\n    We, from the fetters of the light unbound,\r\n    Healed of our wound of living, shall sleep sound.\"\r\n\r\nThe first prominent musician to give a certain portion of his program\r\nregularly to the American composer, was William H. Sherwood. This\r\nrecognition from so distinguished a performer could not but interest\r\nmany who had previously turned a deaf ear to all the musical efforts\r\nof the Eagle. In addition to playing their piano works, he has\r\ntranscribed numerous of their orchestral works to the piano, and\r\nplayed them. In short, he has been so indefatigable a laborer for the\r\ncause of other American composers, that he has found little time to\r\nwrite his own ideas.\r\n\r\nSherwood will be chiefly remembered as a pianist, but he has written a\r\ncertain amount of music of an excellent quality. Opera 1-4 were\r\npublished abroad. Opus 5 is a suite, the second number of which is an\r\n\"Idylle\" that deserves its name. It is as blissfully clear and ringing\r\nas anything could well be, and drips with a Theokritan honey. The\r\nthird number of the suite is called \"Greetings.\" It has only one or\r\ntwo unusual touches. Number 4 bears the suggestive title, \"Regrets for\r\nthe Pianoforte.\" It was possibly written after some of his less\r\npromising pupils had finished a lesson. The last number of the suite\r\nis a quaint Novelette.\r\n\r\n[Music: IDYLLE.\r\n\r\nWM. H. SHERWOOD, OP. 5, NO. 2.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1883, by G. Schirmer.\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT.]\r\n\r\nSherwood's sixth opus is made up of a brace of mazurkas. The former,\r\nin C minor, contains some of his best work. It is original and moody,\r\nand ends strongly. The second, in A major, is still better. It not\r\nonly keeps up a high standard throughout, but shows occasional touches\r\nof the most fascinating art.\r\n\r\nA scherzo (op. 7) cracks a few good jokes, but is mostly elaboration.\r\nOpus 8 is a fiery romanza appassionata. Opus 9 is a Scherzo-Caprice.\r\nThis is probably his best work. It is dedicated to Liszt, and though\r\nextremely brilliant, is full of meaning. It has an interlude of tender\r\nromance. \"Coy Maiden\" is a graceful thing, but hardly deserves the\r\npunishment of so horrible a name. \"A Gypsy Dance\" is too long, but it\r\nis of good material. It has an interesting metre, three-quarter time\r\nwith the first note dotted. There is a good effect gained by\r\nsustaining certain notes over several measures, though few pianists\r\nget a real sostenuto. An \"Allegro Patetico\" (op. 12), \"Medea\" (op.\r\n13), and a set of small pieces (one of them a burlesque called \"A\r\nCaudle Lecture,\" with a garrulous \"said she\" and a somnolent \"said\r\nhe\") make up his rather short list of compositions.\r\n\r\nSherwood was born at Lyons, New York, of good American stock. His\r\nfather was his teacher until the age of seventeen, when he studied\r\nwith Heimberger, Pychowski, and Dr. William Mason. He studied in\r\nEurope with Kullak and Deppe, Scotson Clark, Weitzmann, Doppler,\r\nWuerst, and Richter. He was for a time organist in Stuttgart and later\r\nin Berlin. He was one of those favorite pupils of Liszt, and played in\r\nconcerts abroad with remarkable success, winning at the age of\r\neighteen high critical enthusiasm. He has been more cordially\r\nrecognized abroad than here, but is assuredly one of the greatest\r\nliving pianists. It is fortunate that his patriotism keeps him at\r\nhome, where he is needed in the constant battle against the\r\nindecencies of apathy and Philistinism.\r\n\r\nThe Yankee spirit of constructive irreverence extends to music, and in\r\nrecent years a number of unusually modern-minded theorists have worked\r\nat the very foundations: Dr. Percy Goetschius (born here, and for long\r\na teacher at Stuttgart); O.B. Boise (born here, and teaching now in\r\nBerlin); Edwin Bruce, the author of a very radical work; Homer A.\r\nNorris; and last, and first, A.J. Goodrich, who has made himself one\r\nof the most advanced of living writers on the theory of music, and has\r\nmade so large a contribution to the solidity of our attainments, that\r\nhe is recognized among scholars abroad as one of the leading spirits\r\nof his time. His success is the more pleasing since he was not only\r\nborn but educated in this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.J. GOODRICH.]\r\n\r\nThe town of Chilo, Ohio, was Goodrich' birthplace. He was born there\r\nin 1847, of American parentage. His father taught him the rudiments of\r\nmusic and the piano for one year, after which he became his own\r\nteacher. He has had both a thorough and an independent instructor. The\r\nfact that he has been enabled to follow his own conscience without\r\ndanger of being convinced into error by the prestige of some\r\ninfluential master, is doubtless to be credited with much of the\r\nnovelty and courage of his work.\r\n\r\nHis most important book is undoubtedly his \"Analytical Harmony,\"\r\nthough his \"Musical Analysis\" and other works are serious and\r\nimportant. This is not the place to discuss his technicalities, but\r\none must mention the real bravery it took to discard the old practice\r\nof a figured bass, and to attack many of the theoretical fetiches\r\nwithout hesitation. Almost all of the old theorists have confessed,\r\nusually in a foot-note to the preface or in modest disclaimer lost\r\nsomewhere in the book, that the great masters would occasionally be\r\nfound violating certain of their rules. But this did not lead them to\r\ndeducing their rules from the great masters. Goodrich, however, has,\r\nin this matter, begun where Marx ended, and has gone further even than\r\nProut. He has gone to melody as the groundwork of his harmonic system,\r\nand to the practice of great masters, old and new, for the tests of\r\nall his theories. The result is a book which can be unreservedly\r\ncommended for self-instruction to the ignorant and to the too learned.\r\nIt is to be followed by a book on \"Synthetic Counterpoint,\" of which\r\nGoodrich says, \"It is almost totally at variance with the standard\r\nbooks in counterpoint.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"Musical Analysis\" he quoted freely from American composers,\r\nand analyzed many important native works. He has carried out this plan\r\nalso in his book on \"Interpretation,\" a work aiming to bring more\r\ndefiniteness into the fields of performance and terminology.\r\n\r\nGoodrich' composition is \"a thing of the past,\" he says. In his youth\r\nhe wrote a score or more of fugues, two string quartettes, a trio that\r\nwas played in New York and Chicago, a sonata, two concert overtures, a\r\nhymn for soprano (in English), invisible chorus (in Latin), and\r\norchestra, a volume of songs, and numerous piano pieces. He writes:\r\n\"In truth, I believed at one time that I was a real composer, but\r\nafter listening to Tschaikowski's Fifth Symphony that illusion was\r\ndispelled. Had not Mrs. Goodrich rescued from the flames a few MSS. I\r\nwould have destroyed every note.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a piano suite is left, and this leads one to regret that\r\nTschaikowski should have served as a deterrent instead of an\r\ninspiration. The suite has an inelaborate prelude, which begins\r\nstrongly and ends gracefully, showing unusual handling throughout. A\r\nminuet, taken scherzando, is also most original and happy. There is a\r\nquaint sarabande, and a gavotte written on simple lines, but superbly.\r\nIts musette is simply captivating. All these little pieces indeed show\r\nsterling originality and unusual resources in a small compass.\r\n\r\nW.H. Neidlinger's first three songs were kept in his desk for a year\r\nand then kept by a publisher for a year longer, and finally brought\r\nout in 1889. To his great surprise, the \"Serenade,\" which he calls\r\n\"just a little bit of commonplace melody,\" had an immense sale and\r\ncreated a demand for more of his work. The absolute simplicity of this\r\nexquisite gem is misleading. It is not cheap in its lack of ornament,\r\nbut it eminently deserves that high-praising epithet (so pitilessly\r\nabused), \"chaste.\" It has the daintiness and minute completeness of a\r\nTanagra figurine.\r\n\r\nMr. Neidlinger was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1863, and was compelled\r\nto earn the money for his own education and for his musical studies.\r\nFrom Dudley Buck and, later, C.C. Muller, of New York, he has had his\r\nonly musical instruction. He lived abroad for some time, teaching the\r\nvoice in Paris, then returned to live in Chicago. He has written two\r\noperas, one of them having been produced by the Bostonians.\r\n\r\nMr. Neidlinger builds his songs upon one guiding principle, that is,\r\nfaithfulness to elocutionary accent and intonation. As he neatly\r\nphrases it, his songs are \"colored sketches on a poet's engravings.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual simplicity of Mr. Neidlinger's songs does not forbid a\r\ndramatic outburst at the proper time, as in the fine mood, \"A Leaf;\"\r\nor the sombre depth of \"Night,\" \"Nocturne,\" and \"Solitude;\" or yet the\r\nsustainedly poignant anguish of \"The Pine-tree.\" Occasionally the\r\naccompaniment is developed with elaborateness, as in the bird-flutings\r\nof \"The Robin,\" and \"Memories,\" an extremely rich work, with its\r\nmellow brook-music and a hint of nightingale complaint in the minor.\r\n\"Evening Song,\" a bit of inspired tenderness, is one of Mr.\r\nNeidlinger's best works. Almost better is \"Sunshine,\" a streak of\r\nbrilliant fire quenched with a sudden cloud at the end. Other valuable\r\nworks are \"Messages,\" the happy little Scotch song, \"Laddie,\" and\r\n\"Dreaming,\" which is now sombre, now fierce with outbursts of agony,\r\nbut always a melody, always ariose.\r\n\r\nMr. Neidlinger has made a special study of music for children, his\r\nbook, \"Small Songs for Small Children,\" being much used in\r\nkindergarten work. A book of his, devoted to a synthetic philosophy of\r\nsong, is completed for publication; he calls it \"Spenser, Darwin,\r\nTyndall, etc., in sugar-coated pills; geography, electricity, and\r\nhundreds of other things in song.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cleveland Colony._\r\n\r\nThe city of Cleveland contains a musical colony which is certainly\r\nmore important than that of any town of its size. About the tenth of\r\nour cities in population, it is at least fourth, and possibly third,\r\nin productiveness in valuable composition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILSON G. SMITH.]\r\n\r\nThe most widely known of Cleveland composers is Wilson G. Smith. He\r\nhas been especially fortunate in hitting the golden mean between\r\nforbidding abstruseness and trivial popularity, and consequently\r\nenjoys the esteem of those learned in music as well as of those merely\r\nhappy in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of Wilson G. Smith]\r\n\r\nHis erudition has persuaded him to a large simplicity; his nature\r\nturns him to a musical optimism that gives many of his works a\r\nMozartian cheer. Graciousness is his key.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Elyria, O., and educated in the public schools of\r\nCleveland, where he graduated. Prevented by delicate health from a\r\ncollege education, he has nevertheless, by wide reading, broadened\r\nhimself into culture, and is an essayist of much skill. His musical\r\neducation began in 1876, at Cincinnati, where his teacher, Otto\r\nSinger, encouraged him to make music his profession. In 1880 he was in\r\nBerlin, where he studied for several years under Kiel, Scharwenka,\r\nMoskowski, and Oscar Raif. He then returned to Cleveland, where he\r\ntook up the teaching of organ, piano, voice, and composition.\r\n\r\nThe most important of Smith's earlier works was a series of five\r\npieces called \"Hommage a Edvard Grieg,\" which brought warmest\r\ncommendation from the Scandinavian master. One of the most striking\r\ncharacteristics of Smith's genius is his ability to catch the exact\r\nspirit of other composers. He has paid \"homage\" to Schumann, Chopin,\r\nSchubert, and Grieg, and in all he has achieved remarkable success,\r\nfor he has done more than copy their little tricks of expression,\r\noddities of manner, and pet weaknesses. He has caught the\r\nindividuality and the spirit of each man.\r\n\r\nIn his compositions in Grieg-ton Smith has seized the fascinating\r\nlooseness of the Griegorian tonality and its whimsicality. The\r\n\"Humoresque\" is a bit of titanic merriment; the \"Mazurka\" is most\r\ndeftly built and is full of dance-fire; the \"Arietta\" is highly\r\noriginal, and the \"Capricietto\" shows such ingenious management of\r\ntriplets, and has altogether such a crisp, brisk flavor, that it\r\nreminds one of Lamb's rhapsody on roast pig, where he exclaims, \"I\r\ntasted _crackling_!\" The \"Romance,\" superb in gloom and largeness of\r\ntreatment, is worthy of the composer of \"The Death of Asra.\" A later\r\nwork, \"Caprice Norwegienne,\" is also a strong brew of Scandinavian\r\nessence.\r\n\r\nA \"Schumannesque\" is written closely on the lines of Schumann's\r\n\"Arabesque.\" A later \"Hommage a Schumann\" is equally faithful to\r\nanother style of the master, and dashes forth with characteristic and\r\nun-naive gaiety and challenging thinness of harmony, occasionally\r\nbursting out into great rare chords, just to show what can be done\r\nwhen one tries.\r\n\r\nThe man that could write both this work and the highly faithful\r\n\"Hommage a Schubert,\" and then whirl forth the rich-colored, sensuous\r\nfall and purr of the \"Hommage a Chopin,\" must be granted at least an\r\nunusual command over pianistic materials, and a most unusual acuteness\r\nof observation.\r\n\r\nHe can write _a la_ Smith, too, and has a vein quite his own, even\r\nthough he prefers to build his work on well-established lines, and fit\r\nhis palette with colors well tempered and toned by the masters.\r\n\r\nIn this line is opus 21, a group of four pieces called \"Echoes of Ye\r\nOlden Time.\" The \"Pastorale\" is rather Smithian than olden, with its\r\nmellow harmony, but the \"Minuetto\" is the perfection of chivalric\r\nfoppery and pompous gaiety. The \"Gavotte\" suggests the contagious good\r\nhumor of Bach, and the \"Minuetto Grazioso,\" the best of the series,\r\nhas a touch of the goodly old intervals, tenths and sixths, that taste\r\nlike a draught of spring water in the midst of our modern liqueurs.\r\n\r\nThe musical world in convention assembled has covenanted that certain\r\nharmonies shall be set apart for pasturage. Just why these arbitrary\r\npastorales should suggest meads and syrinxes, and dancing shepherds,\r\nit would be hard to tell. But this effect they certainly have, and a\r\ngood pastorale is a better antidote for the blues and other civic ills\r\nthan anything I know, except the actual green and blue of fields and\r\nskies. Among the best of the best pastoral music, I should place\r\nSmith's \"Gavotte Pastorale.\" It is one of the five pieces in his book\r\nof \"Romantic Studies\" (op. 57).\r\n\r\nThis same volume contains a \"Scherzo alla Tarantella,\" which is full\r\nof reckless wit. But the _abandon_ is so happy as to seem misplaced in\r\na tarantella, that dance whose traditional origin is the maniacal\r\nfrenzy produced by the bite of the tarantula. An earlier Tarantella\r\n(op. 34) is far truer to the meaning of the dance, and fairly raves\r\nwith shrieking fury and shuddering horror. This is better, to me, than\r\nHeller's familiar piece.\r\n\r\nThe \"Second Gavotte\" is a noble work, the naive gaiety of classicism\r\nbeing enriched with many of the great, pealing chords the modern piano\r\nis so fertile in. I count it as one of the most spontaneous gavottes\r\nof modern times, one that is buoyant with the afflation of the olden\r\ndays. It carries a musette of which old Father Bach need not have felt\r\nashamed,--one of the most ingenious examples of a drone-bass ever\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nThe \"Menuet Moderne\" is musical champagne. A very neat series of\r\nlittle variations is sheafed together, and called \"Mosaics.\" Mr. Smith\r\nhas written two pieces well styled \"Mazurka Poetique;\" the later (opus\r\n48) is the more original, but the sweet geniality and rapturously\r\nbeautiful ending of opus 38 is purer music. \"Les Papillons\" is marked\r\nwith a strange touch of negro color; it is, as it were, an Ethiopiano\r\npiece. Its best point is its cadenza. Smith has a great fondness for\r\nthese brilliant precipitations. They not only give further evidence\r\nof his fondness for older schools, but they also partially explain the\r\nfondness of concert performers for his works. His fervid \"Love\r\nSonnet,\" his \"Polonaise de Concert,\" full of virility as well as\r\nvirtuosity, and his delicious \"Mill-wheel Song,\" and a late\r\ncomposition, a brilliant \"Papillon,\" rich as a butterfly's wing, are\r\nnotable among his numerous works. Possibly his largest achievement is\r\nthe three concert-transcriptions for two pianos. He has taken pieces\r\nby Grieg, Raff, and Bachmann, and enlarged, enforced, decorated, and\r\nin every way ennobled them. But to me his most fascinatingly original\r\nwork is his \"Arabesque,\" an entirely unhackneyed and memorable\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nSmith's experience in teaching has crystallized into several pedagogic\r\nworks. His \"Scale Playing with particular reference to the\r\ndevelopment of the third, fourth, and fifth fingers of each hand;\" his\r\n\"Eight Measure,\" \"Octave,\" and \"Five Minute\" studies, have brought the\r\nmost unreserved commendation from the most important of our teachers.\r\nA late and most happy scheme has been the use of a set of variations\r\nfor technical and interpretative instruction. For this purpose he\r\nwrote his \"Themes Arabesques,\" of which numbers one and eighteen not\r\nonly have emotional and artistic interest, but lie in the fingers in a\r\nstrangely tickling way.\r\n\r\nWhat might be called a professorial simplicity is seen in many of\r\nSmith's songs. The almost unadorned, strictly essential beauty of his\r\nmelodies and accompaniments is neither neglect nor cheapness; it is\r\nrestraint to the point of classicism, and romanticism all the intenser\r\nfor repression. Take, for example, that perfect song, \"If I but\r\nKnew,\" which would be one of a score of the world's best short songs,\r\nto my thinking. Note the open fifths, horrifying if you thump them\r\nacademically, but very brave and straightforward, fitly touched.\r\n\r\nThere is something of Haydn at his best in this and in the fluty\r\n\"Shadow Song,\" in \"The Kiss in the Rain,\" and \"A Sailor's Lassie,\" for\r\nthey are as crystalline and direct as \"Papa's\" own immortal\r\n\"Schaeferlied.\"\r\n\r\n[Music: To Mr. Constantin Sternberg.\r\n\r\nARABESQUE.\r\n\r\nWilson G. Smith, Op. 39.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1889, by O. Ditson & Co.]\r\n\r\nSmith has gone over to the great majority,--the composers who have set\r\n\"Du bist wie eine Blume;\" but he has joined those at the top. Two of\r\nSmith's songs have a quality of their own, an appeal that is\r\nbewitching: \"Entreaty,\" a perfect melody, and \"The Dimple in Her\r\nCheek,\" which is fairly peachy in color and flavor.\r\n\r\nA strange place in the world of music is that held by Johann H. Beck,\r\nwhom some have not feared to call the greatest of American composers.\r\nYet none of his music has ever been printed. In this he resembles B.J.\r\nLang, of Boston, who keeps his work persistently in the dark, even\r\nthe sacred oratorio he has written.\r\n\r\nAll of Beck's works, except eight songs, are built on very large\r\nlines, and though they have enjoyed a not infrequent public\r\nperformance, their dimensions would add panic to the usual timidity\r\nof publishers. Believing in the grand orchestra, with its complex\r\npossibilities, as the logical climax of music, Beck has devoted\r\nhimself chiefly to it. He feels that the activity of the modern artist\r\nshould lie in the line of \"amplifying, illustrating, dissecting, and\r\nfilling in the outlines left by the great creators of music and the\r\ndrama.\" He foresees that the most complicated scores of to-day will be\r\nHaydnesque in simplicity to the beginning of the next century, and he\r\nis willing to elaborate his best and deepest learning as far as in him\r\nlies, and wait till the popular audience grows up to him, rather than\r\nwrite down to the level of the present appreciation.\r\n\r\nThe resolve and the patient isolation of such a devotee is nothing\r\nshort of heroic; but I doubt that the truest mission of the artist is\r\nto consider the future too closely. Even the dictionaries and\r\nencyclopaedias of one decade, are of small use to the next. The tiny\r\nlyrics of Herrick, though, have no quarrel with time, nor has time any\r\ngrudge against the intimate figurines of Tanagra. The burdened\r\ntrellises of Richard Strauss may feel the frost long before the\r\nslender ivy of Boccherini's minuet.\r\n\r\n[Music: A FRAGMENT OF THE SCORE OF \"SALAMMBO,\" BY JOHANN H. BECK.]\r\n\r\nScience falls speedily out of date, and philosophy is soon out of\r\nfashion. Art that uses both, is neither. When it makes crutches of\r\nthem and leans its whole weight on them, it will fall with them in\r\nthe period of their inevitable decay.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is evolution here as well as in science. The artist\r\nmust hunt out new forms of expressing his world-old emotions, or he\r\nwill not impress his hearers, and there is no gainsaying Beck's thesis\r\nthat the Chinese puzzle of to-day will be the antique simplicity of a\r\nlater epoch. But it must never be forgotten, that art should be\r\ncomplex only to avoid the greater evils of inadequacy and triteness. A\r\nhigh simplicity of plan and an ultimate popularity of appeal are\r\nessentials to immortal art.\r\n\r\nIt is my great misfortune never to have heard one of Beck's works\r\nperformed, but, judging from a fragment of a deliciously dreamy\r\nmoonlight scene from his unfinished music drama, \"Salammbo,\" which he\r\nkindly sent me, and from the enthusiasm of the severest critics, he\r\nmust be granted a most unusual poetic gift, solidity and whimsicality,\r\nand a hardly excelled erudition. His orchestration shows a hand lavish\r\nwith color and cunning in novel effects. Several of his works have\r\nbeen performed with great applause in Germany, where Beck spent many\r\nyears in study. He was born at Cleveland, in 1856, and is a graduate\r\nof the Leipzig Conservatorium.\r\n\r\nIn art, quality is everything; quantity is only a secondary\r\nconsideration. It is on account of the quality of his work that James\r\nH. Rogers must be placed among the very best of modern song-writers,\r\nthough his published works are not many. When one considers his\r\ntuition, it is small wonder that his music should show the finish of\r\nlong mastery. Born in 1857, at Fair Haven, Conn., he took up the study\r\nof the piano at the age of twelve, and at eighteen was in Berlin,\r\nstudying there for more than two years with Loeschorn, Rohde, Haupt,\r\nand Ehrlich, and then in Paris for two years under Guilmant, Fissot,\r\nand Widor. Since then he has been in Cleveland as organist, concert\r\npianist, and teacher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph of James H. Rogers]\r\n\r\nHis songs are written usually in a characteristic form of dramatic,\r\nyet lyric recitative. His \"Album of Five Songs\" contains notable\r\nexamples of this style, particularly the \"Good-Night,\" \"Come to Me in\r\nMy Dreams,\" and the supremely tragic climax of \"Jealousy.\" The song,\r\n\"Evening,\" with its bell-like accompaniment, is more purely lyric,\r\nlike the enchanting \"At Parting,\" which was too delicately and\r\nfragrantly perfect to escape the wide popularity it has had. His\r\n\"Declaration\" is ravishingly exquisite, and offers a strange contrast\r\nto the \"Requiescat,\" which is a dirge of the utmost largeness and\r\ngrandeur. His graceful \"Fly, White Butterflies,\" and \"In Harbor,\" and\r\nthe dramatic setting of \"The Loreley,\" the jovial \"Gather Ye Rosebuds\"\r\nof jaunty Rob Herrick, the foppish tragedy of \"La Vie est Vaine\" (in\r\nwhich the composer's French prosody is a whit askew), that gallant,\r\nsweet song, \"My True Love Hath My Heart,\" and a gracious setting of\r\nHeine's flower-song, are all noteworthy lyrics. He has set some of\r\nTolstoi's words to music, the sinister love of \"Doubt Not, O Friend,\"\r\nand the hurry and glow of \"The First Spring Days,\" making unusually\r\npowerful songs. In the \"Look Off, Dear Love,\" he did not catch up\r\nwith Lanier's great lyric, but he handled his material most\r\neffectively in Aldrich' \"Song from the Persian,\" with its Oriental\r\nwail followed by a martial joy. The high verve that marks his work\r\nlifts his \"Sing, O Heavens,\" out of the rut of Christmas anthems.\r\n\r\nOf instrumental work, there is only one small book, \"Scenes du Bal,\" a\r\nseries of nine pieces with lyric characterization in the spirit, but\r\nnot the manner of Schumann's \"Carneval.\" The most striking numbers are\r\n\"Les Bavardes,\" \"Blonde et Brune,\" and a fire-eating polonaise.\r\n\r\nThese close the lamentably small number of manifestations of a most\r\ndecisive ability.\r\n\r\nAnother Cleveland composer well spoken of is Charles Sommer.\r\n\r\nA young woman of genuine ability, who has been too busy with teaching\r\nand concert pianism to find as much leisure as she deserves for\r\ncomposition, is Patty Stair, a prominent musical figure in Cleveland.\r\nHer theoretical studies were received entirely at Cleveland, under F.\r\nBassett. Her published works include a book of \"Six Songs,\" all of\r\nthem interesting and artistic, and the \"Madrigal\" particularly\r\ningenious; and a comic glee of the most irresistible humor, called \"An\r\nInterrupted Serenade;\" in manuscript are a most original song,\r\n\"Flirtation,\" a jovial part song for male voices, \"Jenny Kissed Me,\" a\r\nberceuse for violin and piano, a graceful song, \"Were I a Brook,\" a\r\nsetting of Thomas Campion's \"Petition,\" and another deeply stirring\r\nreligious song for contralto, \"O Lamb of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The St. Louis Colony._\r\n\r\nThe most original and important contribution to American music that\r\nSt. Louis has made, is, to my mind, the book of songs written by\r\nWilliam Schuyler. The words were chosen from Stephen Crane's book of\r\npoems, \"The Black Riders.\" The genius of Crane, concomitant with\r\neccentricity as it was, is one of the most distinctive among American\r\nwriters. The book called \"The Black Riders\" contains a number of\r\nmoods that are unique in their suggestiveness and originality. Being\r\nwithout rime or meter, the lines oppose almost as many difficulties to\r\na musician as the works of Walt Whitman; and yet, as Alfred Bruneau\r\nhas set Zola's prose to music, so some brave American composer will\r\nfind inspiration abundant in the works of Walt Whitman and Emily\r\nDickinson.\r\n\r\n[Music: III.\r\n\r\n_WILLIAM SCHUYLER._\r\n\r\n    There was, before me,\r\n    Mile upon mile of snow, ice, burning sand.\r\n    And yet I could look beyond all this,\r\n    To a place of infinite beauty;\r\n    And I could see the loveliness of her\r\n    Who walked in the shade of the trees.\r\n    When I gazed,\r\n    All was lost\r\n    But this place of beauty and her\r\n    When I gazed,\r\n    And in my gazing, desired\r\n    Then came again\r\n    Mile upon mile,\r\n    Of snow, ice, burning sand, burning sand.\r\n\r\nWords used by permission of Copeland and Day.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1897, by Wm. Schuyler.\r\n\r\nFROM WM. SCHUYLER'S \"BLACK RIDERS.\"]\r\n\r\nSchuyler was born in St. Louis, May 4, 1855, and music has been his\r\nlivelihood. He is largely self-taught, and has composed some fifty\r\npieces for the piano, a hundred and fifty songs, a few works for\r\nviolin, viola, and 'cello, and two short trios.\r\n\r\nIn his setting of these lines of Crane's, Schuyler has attacked a\r\ndifficult problem in an ideal manner. To three of the short poems he\r\nhas given a sense of epic vastitude, and to two of them he has given a\r\ntantalizing mysticism. The songs, which have been published privately,\r\nshould be reproduced for the wide circulation they deserve.\r\n\r\nAnother writer of small songs displaying unusual individuality is\r\nGeorge Clifford Vieh, who was born in St. Louis and studied there\r\nunder Victor Ehling. In 1889, he went to Vienna for three years,\r\nstudying under Bruckner, Robert Fuchs, and Dachs. He graduated with\r\nthe silver medal there, and returned to St. Louis, where he has since\r\nlived as a teacher and pianist.\r\n\r\nAlfred George Robyn is the most popular composer St. Louis has\r\ndeveloped. He was born in 1860, his father being William Robyn, who\r\norganized the first symphonic orchestra west of Pittsburg. Robyn was a\r\nyouthful prodigy as a pianist; and, at the age of ten, he succeeded\r\nhis father as organist at St. John's Church, then equipped with the\r\nbest choir in the city. It was necessary for the pedals of the organ\r\nto be raised to his feet. At the age of sixteen he became solo pianist\r\nwith Emma Abbott's company. As a composer Robyn has written some three\r\nhundred compositions, some of them reaching a tremendous sale. A few\r\nof them have been serious and worth while, notably a piano concerto, a\r\nquintette, four string quartettes, a mass, and several orchestral\r\nsuites.\r\n\r\nThere are not many American composers that have had a fugue published,\r\nor have written fugues that deserve publication. It is the distinction\r\nof Ernest Richard Kroeger that he has written one that deserved, and\r\nsecured, publication. This was his 41st opus. It is preceded by a\r\nprelude which, curiously enough, is thoroughly Cuban in spirit and is\r\na downright Habanera, though not so announced. This fiery composition\r\nis followed by a four-voiced \"real\" fugue. The subject is genuinely\r\ninteresting, though the counter-subject is as perfunctory as most\r\ncounter-subjects. The middle-section, the stretto-work, and the\r\npowerful ending, give the fugue the right to exist.\r\n\r\nAmong other publications are a suite for piano (op. 33), in which a\r\nscherzo has life, and a sonata for violin and piano, in which,\r\ncuriously enough, the violin has not one instance of double-stopping,\r\nand the elaborating begins, not with the first subject taken\r\nvigorously, but with the second subject sung out softly. The last\r\nmovement is the best, a quaint and lively rondo. A set of twelve\r\nconcert etudes show the influence of Chopin upon a composer who writes\r\nwith a strong German accent. The etude called \"Castor and Pollux\" is a\r\nvigorous number with the chords of the left hand exactly doubled in\r\nthe right; another etude, \"A Romanze,\" is noteworthy for the practice\r\nit gives in a point which is too much ignored even by the best\r\npianists; that is, the distinction between the importance of the tones\r\nof the same chord struck by the same hand. A work of broad\r\nscholarship, which shows the combined influence of Beethoven and\r\nChopin, who have chiefly affected Kroeger, is his sonata (op. 40). A\r\ndominant pedal-point of fifty-eight measures, in the last movement, is\r\nworth mentioning. In a \"Danse Negre\" and a \"Caprice Negre,\" he has\r\nevidently gone, for his Ethiopian color, not to the actual negro\r\nmusic, but to the similar compositions of Gottschalk. Kroeger was born\r\nin St. Louis, August 10, 1862. At the age of five he took up the study\r\nof the piano and violin. His theoretical tuition was all had in this\r\ncountry. He has written many songs, a piano concerto, sonatas for\r\npiano and viola, and piano and 'cello, two trios, a quintette, and\r\nthree string quartettes, as well as a symphony, a suite, and overtures\r\nbased on \"Endymion,\" \"Thanatopsis,\" \"Sardanapalus\" (produced by Anton\r\nSeidl, in New York), \"Hiawatha,\" and \"Atala.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN COMPOSERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to take up cudgels for a contest on the problem\r\nof woman's right to respect in the creative arts. There are some, it\r\nis true, who deny fervently that the feminine half of mankind ever has\r\nor can or ever will do original and important work there. If you press\r\nthem too hard they will take refuge up this tree, that all women who\r\never have had success have been actually mannish of mind,--a dodge in\r\nquestion-begging that is one of the most ingenious ever devised; a\r\npiece of masculine logic that puts to shame all historic examples of\r\nwomanly fallacy and sophistry. It seems to me that the question is\r\neasily settled on this wise: it is impossible for a rational mind to\r\ndeny that the best work done in the arts by women is of better\r\nquality than the average work done by men. This lets the cat's head\r\nout of the bag, and her whole body follows pell-mell.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances it seems to me that the best things done by women\r\nequal the best things done by men in those lines. The best verses of\r\nSappho, the best sonnets of Mrs. Browning, the best chapters of George\r\nEliot, the best animal paintings of Rosa Bonheur, do not seem to me\r\nsurpassed by their rivals in masculine work. If anything in verse of\r\nits sort is nobler than Mrs. Howe's \"Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" it\r\nis still in manuscript. If there is any poet of more complete\r\nindividuality than Emily Dickinson, I have not run across his books.\r\nIn music I place two or three of Miss Lang's small songs among the\r\nchief of their manner.\r\n\r\nAll over the world the woman-mind is taking up music. The ban that led\r\nFanny Mendelssohn to publish her music under her brother's name, has\r\ngone where the puritanic theory of the disgracefulness of the musical\r\nprofession now twineth its choking coils. A publisher informs me that\r\nwhere compositions by women were only one-tenth of his manuscripts a\r\nfew years ago, they now form more than two-thirds. From such activity,\r\nmuch that is worth while is bound to spring. Art knows no sex, and\r\neven what the women write in man-tone is often surprisingly strong,\r\nthough it is wrongly aimed. But this effort is like the bombast of a\r\nyoung people or a juvenile literature; the directness and repose of\r\nfidelity to nature come later. The American woman is in the habit of\r\ngetting what she sets her heart on. She has determined to write\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nWith an ardor that was ominous of success, Miss Amy Marcy Cheney,\r\nafter a short preliminary course in harmony, resolved to finish her\r\ntuition independently. As an example of the thoroughness that has\r\ngiven her such unimpeachable knowledge of her subject, may be\r\nmentioned the fact that she made her own translation of Berlioz and\r\nGavaert. She was born in New Hampshire, of descent American back to\r\ncolonial times. At the age of four she wrote her opus 1. She is a\r\nconcert pianist as well as a frequent composer in the largest forms.\r\nShe is now Mrs. H.H.A. Beach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. H.H.A. BEACH.]\r\n\r\nNot many living men can point to a composition of more maturity and\r\nmore dignity than Mrs. Beach' \"Jubilate,\" for the dedication of the\r\nWoman's Building at the Columbian Exposition. The work is as big as\r\nits name; it is the best possible answer to skeptics of woman's\r\nmusical ability. It may be too sustainedly loud, and the infrequent\r\nand short passages piano are rather breathing-spells than contrasting\r\nawe, but frequently this work shows a very magnificence of power and\r\nexaltation. And the ending is simply superb, though I could wish that\r\nsome of the terrific dissonances in the accompaniment had been put\r\ninto the unisonal voices to widen the effect and strengthen the final\r\ngrandeur. But as it is, it rings like a clarion of triumph,--the cry\r\nof a Balboa discovering a new sea of opportunity and emotion.\r\n\r\nAnother work of force and daring is the mass in E flat (op. 5), for\r\norgan and small orchestra. It is conventionally ecclesiastic as a\r\nrule, and suffers from Mrs. Beach' besetting sin of over-elaboration,\r\nbut it proclaims a great ripeness of technic. The \"Qui Tollis\" is\r\nespecially perfect in its sombre depth and richness. The \"Credo\" works\r\nup the cry of \"crucifixus\" with a thrilling rage of grief and a\r\ndramatic feeling rare in Mrs. Beach' work. This work was begun at the\r\nage of nineteen and finished three years later. It was given with\r\nnotable effect in 1892 by the Haendel and Haydn Society of Boston.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beach' \"Valse Caprice\" has just one motive,--to reach the maximum\r\nof technical trickiness and difficulty. There is such a thing as\r\nhiding one's light under a bushel, and there is such a thing as\r\nemptying a bushel of chaff upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Fireflies\" is a shimmering and flitting caprice of much ingenuity,\r\nbut it keeps in the field of dissonance almost interminably, and clear\r\nharmony is not so much the homing-place of its dissonance, as an\r\ninfrequent glint through an inadvertent chink. This neat composition\r\nis one of four \"Sketches for the Piano,\" of which \"Phantoms\" is\r\ndelightful with ghostliness. \"In Autumn\" is a most excellent\r\ntone-poem, and \"Dreaming\" is a well-varied lyric. As a colorist Mrs.\r\nBeach is most original and studious. Her tireless hunt for new tints\r\noften diverts her indeed from the direct forthright of her meaning,\r\nbut the \"Danse des Fleurs\" is rich in its gorgeousness. The flowing\r\ngrace of the \"Menuet Italien\" makes it an uncharacteristic but\r\ncharming work.\r\n\r\n[Music: PHANTOMS.\r\n\r\n    \"Toute fragiles fleurs, sitot mortes que nees.\"\r\n                                  Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\nMrs. H.H.A. Beach.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1892, by Arthur P. Schmidt.\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT.]\r\n\r\nHorace, you know, promises to write so that any one will think him\r\neasy to equal, though much sweat will be shed in the effort. It is the\r\ntransparency of her studiousness, and the conspicuous labor in\r\npolishing off effects and mining opportunity to the core, that chiefly\r\nmars the work of Mrs. Beach, in my opinion. One or two of the little\r\npieces that make up the half-dozen of the \"Children's Carnival\" are\r\namong her best work, for the very cheery ease of their look.\r\n\"Pantalon,\" \"Harlequin,\" \"Columbine,\" and \"Secrets\" are infinitely\r\nbetter art than a dozen valse-caprices.\r\n\r\nBoth the defects and effects of her qualities haunt Mrs. Beach' songs.\r\nWhen she is sparing in her erudition she is delightful. Fourteen of\r\nher songs are gathered into a \"Cyclus.\" The first is an \"Ariette,\"\r\nwith an accompaniment imitating the guitar. It is both tender and\r\ngraceful. Probably her best song is the setting of W.E. Henley's fine\r\npoem, \"Dark is the Night.\" It is of the \"Erl-King\" style, but highly\r\noriginal and tremendously fierce and eerie. The same poet's \"Western\r\nWind\" is given a setting contrastingly dainty and serene. \"The\r\nBlackbird\" is delicious and quite unhackneyed. \"A Secret\" is bizarre,\r\nand \"Empress of the Night\" is brilliant. With the exception of a\r\ncertain excess of dissonance for a love-song, \"Wilt Thou Be My\r\nDearie?\" is perfect with amorous tenderness. \"Just for This!\" is a\r\ndelightful vocal scherzo of complete originality and entire success.\r\n\"A Song of Love\" is passionate and yet lyric, ornamented but not\r\nfettered. \"Across the World\" has been one of Mrs. Beach' most popular\r\nsongs; it is intense and singable. \"My Star\" is tender, and the\r\naccompaniment is richly worked out on simple lines. Three Vocal Duets\r\nare well-handled, but the long \"Eilende Wolken\" has a jerky recitative\r\nof Haendelian _naivete_, to which the aria is a welcome relief. Her\r\nsonata for piano and violin has been played here by Mr. Kneisel, and\r\nin Berlin by Mme. Carreno and Carl Halir.\r\n\r\nBesides these, Mrs. Beach has done not a little for the orchestra. Her\r\n\"Gaelic Symphony\" is her largest work, and it has been often played by\r\nthe Boston Symphony, the Thomas, and other orchestras. It is\r\ncharacterized by all her exuberant scholarship and unwearying energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARGARET RUTHVEN LANG.]\r\n\r\nMargaret Ruthven Lang, the daughter of B.J. Lang, is American by birth\r\nand training. She was born in Boston, November 27, 1867. She has\r\nwritten large works, such as three concert overtures, two of which\r\nhave been performed by the Thomas and the Boston Symphony Orchestras,\r\nthough none of them are published. Other unpublished works are a\r\ncantata, two arias with orchestral accompaniment, and a rhapsody for\r\nthe piano. One rhapsody has been published, that in E minor; in spite\r\nof its good details, it is curiously unsatisfying,--it seems all\r\nprelude, interlude, and postlude, with the actual rhapsody\r\naccidentally overlooked. A \"Meditation\" is bleak, with a strong, free\r\nuse of dissonance.\r\n\r\n\"The Jumblies\" is a setting of Edward Lear's elusive nonsense, as full\r\nof the flavor of subtile humor as its original. It is for male chorus,\r\nwith an accompaniment for two pianos, well individualized and erudite.\r\nIt is in her solo songs, however, that her best success is reaped.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that Mrs. Beach' work is markedly virile, I do not mean it\r\nas compliment unalloyed; when I find Miss Lang's work supremely\r\nwomanly, I would not deny it great strength, any more than I would\r\ndeny that quality to the sex of which Joan of Arc and Jael were not\r\nuncharacteristic members.\r\n\r\nSuch a work as the \"Maiden and the Butterfly\" is as fragile and rich\r\nas a butterfly's wing. \"My Lady Jacqueminot\" is exquisitely,\r\ndelicately passionate. \"Eros\" is frail, rare, ecstatic. \"Ghosts\" is\r\nelfin and dainty as snowflakes. The \"Spinning Song\" is inexpressibly\r\nsad, and such music as women best understand, and therefore ought to\r\nmake best. But womanliness equally marks \"The Grief of Love,\" which is\r\nin every sense big in quality; marks the bitterness of \"Oh, What Comes\r\nover the Sea,\" the wailing Gaelic sweetness of the \"Irish Love Song,\"\r\nand the fiery passion of \"Betrayed,\" highly dramatic until its rather\r\ntrite ending. \"Nameless Pain\" is superb. Her \"Lament\" I consider one\r\nof the greatest of songs, and proof positive of woman's high\r\ncapabilities for composition. Miss Lang has a harmonic individuality,\r\ntoo, and finds out new effects that are strange without strain.\r\n\r\n[Music: GHOSTS.\r\n\r\nWords by Munkittrick.\r\n\r\nMARGARET RUTHVEN LANG.\r\n\r\n    Out in the misty moonlight, the first snow flakes I see,\r\n    As they frolic among the leafless boughs of the apple tree.\r\n    Faintly they seem to whisper, as round the boughs they wing;\r\n    \"We are the ghosts of the flowers who died in the early spring,\r\n    Who died in the early spring.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1889, by Arthur P. Schmidt & Co.]\r\n\r\n\"My Turtle Dove,\" among the \"Five Norman Songs,\" in fearlessness and\r\nharmonic exploration shows two of the strongest of Miss Lang's traits.\r\nHer _recherches_ harmonies are no pale lunar reflection of masculine\r\nwork. Better yet, they have the appearance of spontaneous ease, and\r\nthe elaborateness never obtrudes itself upon the coherence of the\r\nwork, except in a few such rare cases as \"My Native Land,\" \"Christmas\r\nLullaby,\" and \"Before My Lady's Window.\" They are singable to a degree\r\nunusual in scholarly compositions. To perfect the result Miss Lang\r\nchooses her poems with taste all too rare among musicians, who seem\r\nusually to rate gush as feeling and gilt as gold. Her \"Oriental\r\nSerenade\" is an example of weird and original intervals, and \"A Spring\r\nSong,\" by Charlotte Pendleton, a proof of her taste in choosing words.\r\n\r\nHer opus 32 is made up of two songs, both full of fire and\r\noriginality. Opus 33 is a captivating \"Spring Idyl\" for the piano, for\r\nwhich she has also written a \"Revery,\" of which the exquisiteness of\r\nsleep is the theme. The music is delicious, and the ending is a rare\r\nproof of the beautiful possibilities of dissonance.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I see in Miss Lang's compositions such a depth of\r\npsychology that I place the general quality of her work above that of\r\nany other woman composer. It is devoid of meretriciousness and of any\r\nsuspicion of seeking after virility; it is so sincere, so true to the\r\nunderlying thought, that it seems to me to have an unusual chance of\r\ninteresting attention and stirring emotions increasingly with the\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and genuine individuality will transpire through the\r\nmost limited amount of creative art. This has been the case with the\r\nfew published works of a writer, whose compositions, though\r\nunpretentious in size and sentiment, yet reveal a graceful fancy, and\r\na marked contemplation upon the details of the moods.\r\n\r\nIrene Baumgras was born at Syracuse, New York, and studied the piano\r\nat the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, where she took the Springer\r\ngold medal in 1881. She studied in Berlin with Moszkowski and Oscar\r\nRaif. She was married in Berlin, in 1884, to Philip Hale, the\r\ndistinguished Boston musical critic.\r\n\r\nHer devotion to her art was so great that her health broke down from\r\noverwork, and she was compelled to give up piano playing. Some of her\r\ncompositions have been published under the name of \"Victor Rene.\" Her\r\n15th opus is made up of three \"Morceaux de Genre,\" of which the\r\n\"Pantomime\" is a most volatile harlequinade, with moods as changeful\r\nas the key; a remarkably interesting composition. Four \"Pensees\r\nPoetiques\" make up opus 16. They include a blithe \"Chansonette\" and a\r\n\"Valse Impromptu,\" which, unlike the usual impromptu, has the _ex\r\ntempore_ spirit. Of her songs, \"Mystery\" is a charming lyric; \"Maisie\"\r\nis faithful to the ghoulish merriment of the words; and \"An Opal\r\nHeart\" is striking for interesting dissonances that do not mar the\r\nfluency of the lyric.\r\n\r\nOf much refinement are the fluent lyrics of Mrs. Mary Knight Wood.\r\nThey show a breadth in little, and a fondness for unexpected harmonies\r\nthat do not disturb the coherence of her songs. They possess also a\r\nmarked spontaneity. An unexpected effect is gained by the brave E flat\r\nin her \"Serenade.\" Her popular \"Ashes of Roses\" also has a rich\r\nharmonic structure. Among other songs, one with an effective obbligato\r\nfor the violoncello deserves special praise. She has written also for\r\nthe violin and piano, and trios for 'cello, violin, and piano.\r\n\r\nOther women who have written certain works of serious intention and\r\nworthy art, are Mrs. Clara A. Korn, Laura Sedgwick Collins, the\r\ncomposer of an ingenious male quartette, \"Love is a Sickness,\" and\r\nmany excellent songs, among them, \"Be Like That Bird,\" which is\r\nideally graceful; Fanny M. Spencer, who has written a collection of\r\nthirty-two original hymn tunes, a good anthem, and a Magnificat and\r\nNunc Dimittis of real strength; Julie Rive-King, the author of many\r\nconcert pieces; Patty Stair, of Cleveland; Harriet P. Sawyer, Mrs.\r\nJessie L. Gaynor, Constance Maud, Jenny Prince Black, Charlotte M.\r\nCrane, and Helen Hood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FOREIGN COMPOSERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOurs is so young, and so cosmopolite, a country, that our art shows\r\nthe same brevity of lineage as our society. Immigration has played a\r\nlarge part in the musical life of the United States, as it has in the\r\nmake-up of the population; and yet for all the multiplexity of his\r\nancestry, the American citizen has been assimilated into a distinctive\r\nindividuality that has all the traits of his different forbears, and\r\nis yet not closely like any of them. So, American music, taking its\r\nscale and most of its forms from the old country, is yet developing an\r\nintegrity that the future will make much of. As with the federation of\r\nthe States, so will one great music ascend polyphonically,--_e\r\npluribus unum_.\r\n\r\nIn compiling this directory of American composers, it has been\r\nnecessary to discuss the works only of the composers who were born in\r\nthis country. It is interesting to see how few of these names are\r\nun-American, how few of them are Germanic (though so many of them have\r\nstudied in Germany). Comment has often been made upon the Teutonic\r\nnature of the make-up of our orchestras. It is pleasant to find that a\r\nvery respectable list of composers can be made up without a\r\npreponderance of German names.\r\n\r\nThe music life of our country, however, has been so strongly\r\ninfluenced and enlivened and corrected by the presence of men who were\r\nborn abroad that some recognition of their importance should somewhere\r\nbe found. Many of them have become naturalized and have brought with\r\nthem so much enthusiasm for our institutions that they are actually\r\nmore American than many of the Americans; than those, particularly,\r\nwho, having had a little study abroad, have gone quite mad upon the\r\nsuperstition of \"atmosphere,\" and have brought home nothing but\r\nforeign mannerisms and discontent.\r\n\r\nAmong the foreign born who have made their home in America, I must\r\nmention with respect, and without attempting to suggest order of\r\nprecedence, the following names:\r\n\r\nC.M. Loeffler, Bruno Oscar Klein, Leopold Godowski, Victor Herbert,\r\nWalter Damrosch, Julius Eichberg, Dr. Hugh A. Clarke, Louis V. Saar,\r\nAsgar Hamerik, Otto Singer, August Hyllested, Xavier Scharwenka,\r\nRafael Joseffy, Constantin von Sternberg, Adolph Koelling, August\r\nSpanuth, Aime Lachaume, Max Vogrich, W.C. Seeboeck, Julian Edwards,\r\nRobert Coverley, William Furst, Gustave Kerker, Henry Waller, P.A.\r\nSchnecker, Clement R. Gale, Edmund Severn, Platon Brounoff, Richard\r\nBurmeister, Augusto Rotoli, Emil Liebling, Carl Busch, John Orth,\r\nErnst Perabo, Ferdinand Dunkley, Mrs. Clara Kathleen Rogers, Miss\r\nAdele Lewing, Mrs. Elisa Mazzucato Young.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps quibbling to rule out some of these names from\r\nAmericanism, and include certain of those whom I have counted American\r\nbecause they were born here, in spite of the fact that their whole\r\ntuition and tendency is alien. But the line must be drawn somewhere.\r\nThe problem is still more trying in the case of certain composers who,\r\nhaving been born here, have expatriated themselves, and joined that\r\nsmall colony of notables whom America has given to Europe as a first\r\ninstalment in payment of the numerous loans we have borrowed from the\r\nold country.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of formally acknowledging this debt, I will not endeavor\r\nto discuss here the careers of George Templeton Strong, Arthur Bird,\r\nor O.B. Boise, all three of whom were born in this country, but have\r\nelected to live in Berlin. Their distinction in that city at least\r\npalely reflects some credit upon the country that gave them birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTLUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century Iceland was the musical center of the world;\r\nstudents went there from all Europe as to an artistic Mecca. Iceland\r\nhas long lost her musical crown. And Welsh music in its turn has\r\nceased to be the chief on earth. Russia is sending up a strong and\r\ngrowing harmony marred with much discord. Some visionaries look to her\r\nfor the new song. But I do not hesitate to match against the serfs of\r\nthe steppes the high-hearted, electric-minded free people of our\r\nprairies; and to prophesy that in the coming century the musical\r\nsupremacy and inspiration of the world will rest here overseas, in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: Misspellings in the original Index have been\r\ncorrected, and the entries have been placed in the proper order.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbt Society, 198.\r\n\r\nAcademy of Dramatic Arts, 79.\r\n\r\nAEschylean Chorus, 53.\r\n\r\nAgramonte, Emilio, 41.\r\n\r\nAldrich, Anna Reeve, 313.\r\n\r\nAldrich, T.B., 89, 108, 204.\r\n\r\nAllen, C.N., 244.\r\n\r\nAllen, N.H., 273.\r\n\r\nAllen, P.C., 272.\r\n\r\nAllison, XIII.\r\n\r\nAmbrosius, Johanna, 349.\r\n\r\nAmericanism in Music, 12, 33, 58.\r\n\r\nApollo Club, 168, 236, 331.\r\n\r\nApthorp, W.F., 370.\r\n\r\nArion Society, 190.\r\n\r\nArnold, Maurice, 135, 139.\r\n\r\nArnold, Sir Edwin, 171.\r\n\r\nAus der Ohe, Adele, 293.\r\n\r\n\r\nBach, J.S., 15, 225, 227, 248, 399, 400.\r\n\r\nBaltzell, Willard J., 275.\r\n\r\nBartlett, H.N., 317, 327.\r\n\r\nBassett, F., 415.\r\n\r\nBates, Arlo, 187, 368.\r\n\r\nBaumgras, Irene, 439.\r\n\r\nBeach, Mrs. H.H.A., 426, 432, 433.\r\n\r\nBeck, Johann H., 406, 411.\r\n\r\nBeethoven, 12, 52, 56, 100, 116, 148, 163, 178, 208, 306.\r\n\r\nBendel, 237.\r\n\r\n\"Ben Hur,\" 72.\r\n\r\nBenkert, G.F., 119.\r\n\r\nBennett, Sterndale, 257.\r\n\r\nBerlioz, 144, 219, 243, 307, 426.\r\n\r\nBernard of Cluny's, 183.\r\n\r\nBest, W.T., 361.\r\n\r\nBird, Arthur, 446.\r\n\r\nBlack, Jennie Prince, 441.\r\n\r\n\"Blind Tom,\" 59.\r\n\r\nBoccherini, 407.\r\n\r\nBodenstedt, 364.\r\n\r\nBoise, O.B., 292, 299, 388, 446.\r\n\r\nBoston Colony, 269, 350, 371.\r\n\r\nBoston Symphony Orchestra, 18, 219, 233, 269, 281, 282, 286, 292, 432.\r\n\r\nBourdillon's, 109, 312.\r\n\r\nBrahms, 56, 97, 114, 255, 284.\r\n\r\nBreton, XIII.\r\n\r\nBrewer, J.H., 331, 334.\r\n\r\nBristow, George F., 246.\r\n\r\nBrockway, Howard, 298, 304.\r\n\r\nBrounoff, Platon, 445.\r\n\r\nBrowning, E.B., 424.\r\n\r\nBrowning, Robt., 89, 99.\r\n\r\nBruce, Edwin, 388.\r\n\r\nBruch, Max, 136.\r\n\r\nBruckner, 419.\r\n\r\nBruneau, Alfred, 418.\r\n\r\nBuck, Dudley, 165, 173, 174, 305, 324, 331, 361, 381, 392.\r\n\r\nBullard, F.F., 351, 357.\r\n\r\nBurmeister, Richard, 445.\r\n\r\nBurns, 204.\r\n\r\nBurton, F.R., 273.\r\n\r\nBusch, Carl, 445.\r\n\r\nByrd, XIII.\r\n\r\nByron, 252.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanova, 12.\r\n\r\nCarew, XIII.\r\n\r\nCarnegie, A., 256.\r\n\r\nCarpenter, H.B., 213.\r\n\r\nCarreno, 36.\r\n\r\nCarroll, Lewis, 212.\r\n\r\nCarter, R.I., 294.\r\n\r\nChadwick, Geo.
