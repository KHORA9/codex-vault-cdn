JOHNSON’S OPINIONS OF LONDON.--“It is not in the showy evolution of\r\nbuildings, but in the multiplicity of human habitations, that the\r\nwonderful immensity of London consists.... The happiness of London is not\r\nto be conceived but by those who have been in it. I will venture to say\r\nthere is more learning and science within the circumference of where we\r\nnow sit than in all the rest of the kingdom.... A man stores his mind [in\r\nLondon] better than anywhere else.... No place cures a man’s vanity or\r\narrogance so well as London, for no man is either great or good, _per se_,\r\nbut as compared with others, not so good or great, and he is sure to find\r\nin the metropolis many his equals and some his superiors.... No man of\r\nletters leaves London without regret.... By seeing London I have seen as\r\nmuch of life as the world can show.... When a man is tired of London he is\r\ntired of life, for there is in London all life can afford, and [London] is\r\nthe fountain of intelligence and pleasure.”--_Boswell’s Life of Johnson._\r\n\r\nBOSWELL’S OPINION OF LONDON.--“I have often amused myself with thinking\r\nhow different a place London is to different people. They whose narrow\r\nminds are contracted to the consideration of some one particular pursuit,\r\nview it only through that medium, a politician thinks of it merely as the\r\nseat of government, etc.; but the intellectual man is struck with it _as\r\ncomprehending the whole of human life in all its variety, the\r\ncontemplation of which is inexhaustible_.”--_Boswell’s Life of Johnson_\r\n(Croker, 1848), p. 144.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  HAUNTED LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n  BY WALTER THORNBURY\r\n\r\n  EDITED BY EDWARD WALFORD, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TEMPLE BAR, 1761.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _ILLUSTRATED BY F. W. FAIRHOLT, F.S.A._\r\n\r\n\r\n  London\r\n  CHATTO & WINDUS, PICCADILLY\r\n  1880\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book deals less with the London of the ghost-stories, the scratching\r\nimpostor in Cock Lane, or the apparition of Parson Ford at the Hummums,\r\nthan with the London consecrated by manifold traditions--a city every\r\nstreet and alley of which teems with interesting associations, every\r\npaving-stone of which marks, as it were, the abiding-place of some ancient\r\nlegend or biographical story; in short, this London of the present haunted\r\nby the memories of the past.\r\n\r\nThe slow changes of time, the swifter destructions of improvement, and the\r\ninevitable necessities of modern civilisation, are rapidly remodelling\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIt took centuries to turn the bright, swift little rivulet of the Fleet\r\ninto a fœtid sewer, years to transform the palace at Bridewell into a\r\nprison; but events now move faster: the alliance of money with enterprise,\r\nand the absence of any organised resistance to needful though sometimes\r\nreckless improvements, all combine to hurry forward modern changes.\r\n\r\nIf an alderman of the last century could arise from his sleep, he would\r\nshudder to see the scars and wounds from which London is now suffering.\r\nViaducts stalk over our chief roads; great square tubes of iron lie heavy\r\nas nightmares on the breast of Ludgate Hill. In Finsbury and Blackfriars\r\nthere are now to be seen yawning chasms as large and ghastly as any that\r\nbreaching cannon ever effected in the walls of a besieged city. On every\r\nhand legendary houses, great men’s birthplaces, the haunts of poets, the\r\nscenes of martyrdoms, and the battle-fields of old factions, heave and\r\ntotter around us. The tombs of great men, in the chinks of which the\r\nnettles have grown undisturbed ever since the Great Fire, are now being\r\nuprooted. Milton’s house has become part of the _Punch_ office. A printing\r\nmachine clanks where Chatterton was buried. Almost every moment some\r\nbuilding worthy of record is shattered by the pickaxes of ruthless\r\nlabourers. The noise of falling houses and uprooted streets even now in my\r\nears tells me how busily Time, the Destroyer and the Improver, is working;\r\nerasing tombstones, blotting out names on street-doors, battering down\r\nnarrow thoroughfares, and effacing one by one the memories of the good,\r\nthe bad, the illustrious, and the infamous.\r\n\r\nA sincere love of the subject, and a strong conviction of the importance\r\nof the preservation of such facts as I have dredged up from the Sea of\r\nOblivion, have given me heart for my work. The gradual changes of Old\r\nLondon, and the progress of civilisation westward, are worth noting by all\r\nstudents of the social history of England. It will be found that many\r\ntraits of character, many anecdotes of interest, as illustrating\r\nbiography, are essentially connected with the habitations of the great men\r\nwho have either been born in London, or have resorted to it as the centre\r\nof progress, art, commerce, government, learning, and culture. The fact of\r\nthe residence of a poet, a painter, a lawyer, or even a rogue, at any\r\ndefinite date, will often serve to point out the social status he either\r\naimed at or had acquired. It helps also to show the exact relative\r\ndistinctions in fashion and popularity of different parts of London at\r\nparticular epochs, and contributes to form an illustrated history of\r\nLondon, proceeding not by mere progression of time, and dealing with the\r\nabstract city--the whole entity of London--but marching through street\r\nafter street, and detailing local history by districts at a time.\r\n\r\nA century after the martyrs of the Covenant had shed their blood for the\r\ngood old cause, an aged man, mounted on a little rough pony, used\r\nperiodically to make the tour of their graves; with a humble and pious\r\ncare he would scrape out the damp green moss that filled up the letters\r\nonce so sharp and clear, cut away the thorny arches of the brambles, tread\r\ndown the thick, prickly undergrowth of nettles, and leave the brave names\r\nof the dead men open to the sunlight. It is something like this that I\r\nhave sought to do with London traditions.\r\n\r\nI have especially avoided, in every case, mixing truth with fiction. I\r\nhave never failed to give, where it was practicable, the actual words of\r\nmy authorities, rather than run the risk of warping or distorting a\r\nquotation even by accident, or losing the flavour and charm of original\r\ntestimony. Aware of the paramount value of sound and verified facts, I\r\nhave not stopped to play with words and colours, nor to sketch imaginary\r\ngroups and processions. Such pictures are often false and only mislead;\r\nbut a fact proved, illustrated, and rendered accessible by index and\r\nheading, is, however unpretentious, a contribution to history, and has\r\nwith certain inquirers a value that no time can lesson.\r\n\r\nIn a comprehensive work, dealing with so many thousand dates, and\r\nintroducing on the stage so many human beings, it is almost impossible to\r\nhave escaped errors. I can only plead for myself that I have spared no\r\npains to discover the truth. I have had but one object in view, that of\r\nrendering a walk through London a journey of interest and of pilgrimage to\r\nmany shrines.\r\n\r\nIn some cases I have intentionally passed over, or all but passed over,\r\noutlying streets that I thought belonged more especially to districts\r\nalien to my present plan. Maiden Lane, for example, with its memories of\r\nVoltaire, Marvell, and Turner, belongs rather to a chapter on Covent\r\nGarden, of which it is a palpable appanage; and Chancery Lane I have left\r\ntill I come to Fleet Street.\r\n\r\nI should be ungrateful indeed if, in conclusion, I did not thank Mr.\r\nFairholt warmly for his careful and valuable drawings on wood. To that\r\naccomplished antiquary I am indebted, as my readers will see, for several\r\noriginal sketches of bygone places, and for many curious illustrations\r\nwhich I should certainly not have obtained without the aid of his learning\r\nand research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.

Wale. The view is\r\n  taken from the City side of the Bar, looking through the\r\n  arch to Butcher Row and St. Clement’s Church. The sign\r\n  projecting from the house to the spectator’s left is that\r\n  of the famous Devil Tavern                           _Vignette on Title_\r\n\r\n                                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n  OLD HOUSES, SHIP YARD, TEMPLE BAR, circa 1761, from a plate\r\n  in Wilkinson’s _Londina Illustrata_                                    4\r\n\r\n  THE LORD MAYOR’S SHOW. From the picture by Hogarth                    19\r\n\r\n  TEMPLE BAR, 1746, copied from an undated print published soon\r\n  after the execution of the rebel adherents of the young\r\n  Pretender. The view is surrounded by an emblematic framework,\r\n  and contains representations of the heads of Townley and\r\n  Fletcher, remarkable as the last so exposed; they remained\r\n  there till 1772                                                       23\r\n\r\n  ST. CLEMENT’S CHURCH AND THE STRAND IN 1753, from a print by\r\n  I. Maurer                                                             25\r\n\r\n\r\n  TWO VIEWS OF ARUNDEL HOUSE, 1646, after Hollar. These views,\r\n  unique of their kind, are particularly valuable for the\r\n  clear idea they give of a noble London mansion of the period.\r\n  Arundel House retains many ancient features, particularly in\r\n  its dining-hall, which, with the brick residence for the\r\n  noble owner, is the only dignified portion of the building.\r\n  The rest has the character of an inn-yard--a mere collection\r\n  of ill-connected outhouses and stabling. The shed with the\r\n  tall square window in the roof was the depository of the\r\n  famous collection of pictures and antiques made by the\r\n  renowned Earl, part of which still forms the Arundel\r\n  Collection at Oxford                                              40, 41\r\n\r\n  PENN’S HOUSE, NORFOLK STREET, 1749, from a view by J. Buck.\r\n  The view is taken from the river, looking up Norfolk Street\r\n  to a range of old houses, still standing, in the Strand.\r\n  Penn’s house was the last on the west side of the street (to\r\n  the spectator’s left), overlooking the water                          55\r\n\r\n  SOMERSET HOUSE FROM THE RIVER, 1746, from an engraving by I.\r\n  Knyff. Upon a barge moored in the river is seen the famous\r\n  coffee-house known as “The Folly,” which, originally used as\r\n  a musical summer-house, ended in being the resort of depravity        56\r\n\r\n  STRAND FRONT OF SOMERSET HOUSE, 1777, from a large engraving\r\n  after I. Moss                                                         80\r\n\r\n  JACOB TONSON’S BOOK-SHOP, 1742, from an etching by Benoist.\r\n  The shop of this famous bibliopole was opposite Catherine\r\n  Street. The view is obtained from the background of the\r\n  print representing a burlesque procession of Masons, got up\r\n  by some humourist in ridicule of the craft                            82\r\n\r\n  OLD HOUSES IN THE STRAND, 1742, copied from the same print as\r\n  the preceding view. These houses stood on the site of the\r\n  present Wellington Street                                            104\r\n\r\n  THE SAVOY, FROM THE THAMES, IN 1650, after Hollar                    106\r\n\r\n  THE SAVOY CHAPEL, from an original drawing                           119\r\n\r\n  THE SAVOY PRISON, 1793, from an etching by J. T. Smith               125\r\n\r\n  DURHAM HOUSE, 1790, from an etching by J. T. Smith                   126\r\n\r\n  THE WATER GATE, 1860, from a Sketch                                  133\r\n\r\n  YORK STAIRS AND SURROUNDING BUILDINGS, circa 1745, after an\r\n  original drawing by Canaletti in the British Museum. This is\r\n  one of the few interesting views of Old London sketched by\r\n  Canaletti during his short stay in England. It comprises the\r\n  famous water-gate designed by Inigo Jones, and the tall\r\n  wooden tower of the York Buildings Water Company. The large\r\n  mansion behind this (at the south-west corner of Buckingham\r\n  Street) was that inhabited by Pepys from 1684, and in which\r\n  he entertained the members of the Royal Society during his\r\n  presidency.

The two little lion-like men stood watching “the sublime\r\ncanopy that shrouds the city of the world.”[1] Now it spread and seethed\r\nlike the incense from Moloch’s furnace; now it lifted and thinned into the\r\npurer blue, like the waft of some great sacrifice, or settled down to\r\ndeeper and gloomier grandeur over “the vastness of modern Babylon.” That\r\nbrown cloud hid a huge ants’ nest teeming with three millions of people.\r\nThat dome, with its golden coronet and cross, rose like the globe in an\r\nemperor’s hand--a type of the civilisation, and power, and Christianity of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of the two men beat faster at the great sight.\r\n\r\n“Be George!” said Fuseli, shaking his white hair and stamping his little\r\nfoot, “be George! sir, it’s like the smoke of the Israelites making bricks\r\nfor the Egyptians.”\r\n\r\n“It is grander, Fuseli,” said Haydon, “for it is the smoke of a people who\r\nwould _have made the Egyptians make bricks for them_.”\r\n\r\nIt is of the multitudinous streets of this more than Egyptian city, their\r\ntraditions, and their past and present inhabitants, that I would now\r\nwrite. I shall not pass by many houses where any eminent men dwell or\r\ndwelt, without some biographical anecdote, some epigram, some\r\nillustration; yet I will not stop long at any door, because so many others\r\nawait me. I have “set down,” I hope, “nought in malice.” Truth I trust has\r\nbeen, and truth alone shall be, my object. I shall stay at Charing Cross\r\nto point out the heroism of the dying regicides; I shall pause at\r\nWhitehall to narrate some redeeming traits even in the character of a\r\nwilful king.\r\n\r\nThe growth of London, and its conquest of suburb after suburb, has roused\r\nthe imagination of poets and essayists ever since the days of Queen\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nWhen James I. forbade the building of fresh houses outside London walls,\r\nhe little foresaw the time when the City would become almost impassable;\r\nwhen practical men would burrow roads under ground, or make subterranean\r\nrailways to drain off the choking traffic; when cool-headed people would\r\nseriously propose to have flying bridges thrown over the chief\r\nthoroughfares; when new manners and customs, new diseases, new follies,\r\nnew social complications would arise, from the fact of three millions of\r\nmen silently agreeing to live together on only eleven square miles of\r\nland; when fish would cease to inhabit the poisoned river; when the roar\r\nof the traffic would render it almost impossible to converse; when, in\r\nfact, London would grow too large for comfort, safety, pleasure, or even\r\nsocial intercourse.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to select from what centre to commence a pilgrimage. For\r\nold Roman London we might start from the Exchange or the Tower; for\r\nmediæval London from Chepe or Aldermanbury; for fashionable London from\r\nCharing Cross; for Shaksperean London from the Globe or Blackfriars. Even\r\nthen our tours would be circuitous, and sometimes retrograde, and we\r\nshould turn and double like hares before the hounds.\r\n\r\nI have for several reasons, therefore, and after some consideration,\r\ndecided to start from Temple Bar, and walk westward along the Strand to\r\nCharing Cross; then to turn up St. Martin’s Lane, and return by Longacre\r\nand Drury Lane to Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields.\r\n\r\nThat walk embraces the long line of palaces which once adorned the Strand,\r\nor river-bank street, the countless haunts of artists in St. Martin’s\r\nLane, the legends of Longacre, the theatrical reminiscences of Drury Lane,\r\nand the old noblemen’s houses in Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields. It comprises a\r\nperiod not so remote as East London, and not so modern as that of the West\r\nEnd. It brings us acquainted not only with many of the contemporaries of\r\nShakspere and Dryden, but also with many celebrities of Garrick’s time and\r\nof Dr. Johnson’s age.\r\n\r\nIf this is not the best point of departure, it has at least much to be\r\nsaid in its favour, as the loop I have drawn includes nothing intramural,\r\nand comprises a part of London inhabited by persons who lived more within\r\nthe times of memoir-writing than those in the farther East,--a district,\r\ntoo, more within the range of the antiquary than the newer region of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nI trust that in these remarks I have in some degree explained why I have\r\nspent so much time in pouring “old wine into new bottles.”\r\n\r\nA preface is too often a pillory made by an author, in which he exposes\r\nhimself to a shower of the most unsavoury missiles. I trust that mine may\r\nbe considered only as a wayside stone on which I stand to offer a fitting\r\napology for what I trust is a venial fault.\r\n\r\nIt is the glory of my old foster-mother, London, I would celebrate; it is\r\nher virtues and her crimes I would record. Her miles of red-tiled roofs,\r\nher quiet green squares, her vast black mountain of a cathedral, her\r\nsilver belt of a river, her acres and acres of stony terraces, her\r\nbeautiful parks, her tributary fleets, seem to me as so many episodes in\r\none great epic, the true delineation of which would form a new chapter in\r\nthe HISTORY OF MANKIND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIP YARD, TEMPLE BAR, 1761.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTEMPLE BAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTemple Bar, that old dingy gateway of blackened Portland stone which\r\nseparates the Strand from Fleet Street, the City from the Shire, and the\r\nFreedom of the City of London from the Liberty of the City of Westminster,\r\nwas built by Sir Christopher Wren in the year 1670, four years after the\r\nGreat Fire, and ten after the Restoration.\r\n\r\nIn earlier days there were at this spot only posts, rails, and a chain, as\r\nat Holborn, Smithfield, and Whitechapel. In later times, however, a house\r\nof timber was erected, with a narrow gateway and one passage on the south\r\nside.[2]\r\n\r\nThe original Bar seems to have crossed Fleet Street, several yards farther\r\nto the east of its successor. In the time of James I. it consisted of an\r\niron railing with a gate in the middle. A man sat on the spot for many\r\nyears after the erection of the new gate, to take toll from all carts\r\nwhich had not the City arms painted on them.\r\n\r\nTemple Bar, if described now in an architect’s catalogue, would be noted\r\nas pierced with two side posterns for foot passengers, and having a\r\ncentral flattened archway for carriages. In the upper story is an\r\napartment with semicircular arched windows on the eastern and western\r\nsides, and the whole is crowned with a sweeping pediment.\r\n\r\nOn the western or Westminster side there are two niches, in which are\r\nplaced mean statues of Charles I. and Charles II. in fluttering Roman\r\nrobes, and on the east or Fleet Street side there are statues of James I.\r\nand Queen Elizabeth. They are all remarkable for their small feeble heads,\r\ntheir affected and crinkled drapery, and the piebald look produced by\r\ntheir projecting hands and feet being washed white by years of rain, while\r\nthe rest of their bodies remains a sooty black.\r\n\r\nThe upper room is held of the City by the partners of the very ancient\r\nfirm of Messrs. Child, bankers. There they store their books and records,\r\nas in an old muniment-chamber. The north side ground floor, next to Shire\r\nLane, was occupied as a barber’s shop from the days of Steele and the\r\n_Tatler_.\r\n\r\nThe centre slab on the east side of Temple Bar once contained the\r\nfollowing inscription, now all but obliterated:--“Erected in the year\r\n1670, Sir Samuel Sterling, Mayor; continued in the year 1671, Sir Richard\r\nFord, Lord Mayor; and finished in the year 1672, Sir George Waterman,\r\nLord Mayor.” It is probable that the corresponding western slab, and also\r\nthe smaller one over the postern, once bore inscriptions.\r\n\r\nTemple Bar was doomed to destruction by the City as early as 1790, through\r\nthe exertions of Alderman Picket. “Threatened men live long,” says an old\r\nItalian proverb. Temple Bar still stands[3] a narrow neck to an immense\r\ndecanter; an impeder of traffic, a venerable nuisance, with nothing\r\ninteresting but its associations and its dirt. But then let us remember\r\nthat as Holborn Hill has tormented horses and drivers ever since the\r\nConquest, and its steepness is not yet in any way mitigated,[4] we must\r\nnot expect hasty reforms in London.\r\n\r\nIt does not enter into my purpose (unless I walked like a crab, backwards)\r\nto give the history of Child’s bank. Suffice it for me to say that it\r\nstands on part of the site of the old Devil Tavern, kept by old Simon\r\nWadloe, where Ben Jonson held his club. It was taken down in 1788, and\r\nChild’s Place built in its stead.[5] Alderman Backwell, who was ruined by\r\nthe shutting up of the Exchequer in the reign of Charles II., and became a\r\npartner in this, the oldest banking-house in London, was the agent for\r\nGovernment in the sale of Dunkirk to the French.\r\n\r\nPepys makes frequent allusions to his friend Child, probably one of the\r\nfounders of this bank. The Duke of York opposed his interference in\r\nAdmiralty matters, and had a quarrel with a gentleman who declared that\r\nwhoever impugned Child’s honesty must be a knave. Child wrote an\r\nenlightened work on Indian trade, supporting the interests of the East\r\nIndia Company.\r\n\r\nApollo Court, exactly opposite the bank, marks a passage that once faced\r\nthe Apollo room, from whose windows Ben Jonson must have often glowered\r\nand Herrick laughed.\r\n\r\nArchenholz says that in his day there were forty-eight bankers in London.\r\n“The Duke of Marlborough,” writes the Prussian traveller, “had some years\r\nago in the hands of Child the banker, a fund of ten, fifteen, or twenty\r\nthousand pounds. Drummond had often in his hands several hundred thousand\r\npounds at one time belonging to the Government.”[6]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest London Directory (1677),[7] among “the goldsmiths that\r\nkeep running cashes,” we find “Richard Blanchard and Child, at the\r\nMarygold in Fleet Street.” The huge marigold (really a sun in full shine),\r\nabove four feet high, the original street-sign of the old goldsmiths at\r\nTemple Bar, is still preserved in one of the rooms of Child’s bank.\r\n\r\nJohn Bushnell, the sculptor who executed the statues on Temple Bar, being\r\ncompelled by his master, Burman, of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, to marry a\r\ndiscarded servant-maid, went to Italy, and resided in Rome and Venice, and\r\nin the latter place executed a monument to a Procuratore, representing a\r\nnaval engagement between the Venetians and the Turks. His best works are\r\nCowley’s monument, that of Sir Palmes Fairborne in Westminster Abbey, and\r\nLord Mordaunt’s statue in Fulham church. He also executed the statues of\r\nCharles I., Charles II., and Sir Thomas Gresham for the Royal Exchange. He\r\nhad agreed to complete the set of kings, but Cibber being also engaged,\r\nBushnell would not finish the six or seven he had begun. Being told by\r\nrival sculptors that he could carve only drapery, and not the naked\r\nfigure, he produced a very despicable Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nThe next whim of this vain, fantastic, and crazy man, was to prove that\r\nthe Trojan Horse could really have been constructed.[8] He therefore had a\r\nwooden horse built with huge timbers, which he proposed to cover with\r\nstucco. The head held twelve men and a table; the eyes served as windows.\r\nBefore it was half completed, however, it was demolished by a storm of\r\nwind, and no entreaties of the two vintners who had contracted to use the\r\nhorse for a drinking booth could induce the mortified projector to rebuild\r\nthe monster, which had already cost him £500. A wiser plan of his, that of\r\nbringing coal to London by sea, also miscarried; and the loss of an estate\r\nin Kent, through an unsuccessful lawsuit, completed the overthrow of\r\nBushnell’s never very well-balanced brain. He died in 1701, and was buried\r\nat Paddington. His two sons (to one of whom he left £100 a year, and to\r\nthe other £60) became recluses, moping in an unfinished house of their\r\nfather’s, facing Hyde Park, in the lane leading from Piccadilly to Tyburn,\r\nnow Park Lane. This strange abode had neither staircase nor doors, but\r\nthere they brooded, sordid and impracticable, saying that the world had\r\nnot been worthy of their father. Vertue, in 1728, describes a visit to the\r\nhouse, which was then choked with unfinished statues and pictures. There\r\nwas a ruined cast of an intended brass equestrian statue of Charles II.:\r\nan Alexander and other unfinished kings completed the disconsolate\r\nbrotherhood. Against the wall leant a great picture of a classic triumph,\r\nalmost obliterated; and on the floor lay a bar of iron, as thick as a\r\nman’s wrist, that had been broken by some forgotten invention of\r\nBushnell’s.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of the absurd Meal-Tub Plot, in 1679, the 17th of\r\nNovember, the anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth was kept,\r\naccording to custom, as a high Protestant festival, and celebrated by an\r\nextraordinary procession, at the expense of the Green-Ribbon Club, a few\r\ncitizens, and some gentlemen of the Temple. The bells began to ring out at\r\nthree o’clock in the morning; at dusk the procession began at Moorgate,\r\nand passed through Cheapside and Fleet Street, where it ended with a huge\r\nbonfire, “just over against the Inner Temple gate.”[9]\r\n\r\nThe stormy procession was thus constituted:--\r\n\r\n1. Six whifflers, in pioneer caps and red waistcoats, who cleared the\r\nway. 2. A bellman, ringing his bell, and with a doleful voice crying,\r\n“Remember Justice Godfrey.” 3. A dead body, representing the wood-merchant\r\nof Hartshorne Lane (Sir E. Godfrey), in a decent black habit, white\r\ngloves, and the cravat wherewith he was murdered about his neck, with\r\nspots of blood on his wrists, breast, and shirt. This figure was held on a\r\nwhite horse by a man representing one of the murderers. 4. A priest in a\r\nsurplice and cope, embroidered with bones, skulls, and skeletons. He\r\nhanded pardons to all who would meritoriously murder Protestants. 5. A\r\npriest, bearing a great silver cross. 6. Four Carmelite friars, in white\r\nand black robes. 7. Four Grey Friars. 8. Six Jesuits with bloody daggers.\r\n9. The waits, playing all the way. 10. Four bishops in purple, with lawn\r\nsleeves, golden crosses on their breasts, and croziers in their hands. 11.\r\nFour other bishops, in full pontificals (copes and surplices), wearing\r\ngilt mitres. 12. Six cardinals, in scarlet robes and caps. 13. The Pope’s\r\nchief physician, with Jesuits’ powder and other still more grotesque\r\nbadges of his office. 14. Two priests in surplices, bearing golden\r\ncrosses. 15. Then came the centre of all this pageant, the Pope himself,\r\nsitting in a scarlet and gilt fringed chair of state. His feet were on a\r\ncushion, supported by two boys in surplices, with censers and white silk\r\nbanners, painted with red crosses and bloody consecrated daggers. His\r\nHoliness wore a scarlet gown, lined with ermine and daubed with gold and\r\nsilver lace. On his head he had the triple tiara, and round his neck a\r\ngilt collar, strung with precious stones, beads, Agnus Dei’s, and St.\r\nPeter’s keys. At the back of his chair climbed and whispered the devil,\r\nwho hugged and caressed him, and sometimes urged him aloud to kill King\r\nCharles, or to forge a Protestant plot and to fire the city again, for\r\nwhich purpose he kept a torch ready lit.\r\n\r\nThe number of spectators in the balconies and windows was computed at two\r\nhundred thousand. A hundred and fifty flambeaux followed the procession by\r\norder, and as many more came as volunteers.\r\n\r\nRoger North also describes a fellow with a stentorophonic tube (a\r\nspeaking-trumpet), who kept bellowing out--“Abhorrers! abhorrers!”[10]\r\n\r\nLastly came a complaisant, civil gentleman, who was meant to represent\r\neither Sir Roger l’Estrange, or the King of France, or the Duke of York.\r\n“Taking all in good part, he went on his way to the fire.”\r\n\r\nAt Temple Bar some of the mob had crowned the statue of Elizabeth with\r\ngilt laurel, and placed in her hand a gilt shield with the motto, “The\r\nProtestant Religion and Magna Charta.” A spear leant against her arm, and\r\nthe niche was lit with candles and flambeaux, so that, as North said, she\r\nlooked like the goddess Pallas, the object of some solemn worship and\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nAll this time perpetual battles and skirmishes went on between the Whigs\r\nand Tories at the different windows, and thousands of volleys of squibs\r\nwere discharged.\r\n\r\nWhen the pope was at last toppled into the fire a prodigious shout was\r\nraised, that spread as far as Somerset House, where the queen then was,\r\nand, as a pamphleteer of the time says, before it ceased, reached\r\nScotland, France, and even Rome.\r\n\r\nFrom these processions the word MOB (_mobile vulgus_) became introduced\r\ninto our language.[11] In 1682, Charles II. tried to prohibit this annual\r\nfestival, but it continued nevertheless till the reign of Queen Anne, or\r\neven later.[12]\r\n\r\nAt Temple Bar, where the houses seemed turned into mountains of heads, and\r\nmany fireworks were let off, a man representing the English cardinal\r\n(Philip Howard, brother of the Duke of Norfolk) sang a rude part-song with\r\nother men who personated the people of England. The cardinal first\r\nbegan:--\r\n\r\n  “From York to London town we come\r\n    To talk of Popish ire,\r\n  To reconcile you all to Rome,\r\n    And prevent Smithfield fire.”\r\n\r\nTo which the people replied, valorously:--\r\n\r\n  “Cease, cease, thou Norfolk cardinal,\r\n    See! yonder stands Queen Bess,\r\n  Who saved our souls from Popish thrall:\r\n    Oh, Bess! Queen Bess! Queen Bess!\r\n\r\n  “Your Popish plot, and Smithfield threat,\r\n    We do not fear at all,\r\n  For, lo! beneath Queen Bess’s feet,\r\n    You fall! you fall! you fall!\r\n\r\n  “’Tis true our king’s on t’other side,\r\n    A looking t’wards Whitehall,\r\n  But could we bring him round about,\r\n    He’d counterplot you all.\r\n\r\n  “Then down with James and up with Charles,\r\n    On good Queen Bess’s side,\r\n  That all true commons, lords, and earls\r\n    May wish him a fruitful bride.\r\n\r\n  “Now God preserve great Charles our king,\r\n    And eke all honest men,\r\n  And traitors all to justice bring:\r\n    Amen! Amen! Amen!”\r\n\r\nIt was formerly the barbarous and brutal custom to place the heads and\r\nquarters of traitors upon Temple Bar as scarecrows to all persons who did\r\nnot consider William of Orange, or the Elector of Hanover, the rightful\r\npossessors of the English crown.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Armstrong was the first to help to deck Wren’s new arch. When\r\nShaftesbury fled in 1683, and the Court had partly discovered his\r\nintrigues with Monmouth and the Duke of Argyle, the more desperate men of\r\nthe Exclusion Party plotted to stop the king’s coach as he returned from\r\nNewmarket to London, at the Rye House, a lonely mansion near Hoddesden.\r\nThe plot was discovered, and Monmouth escaped to Holland. In the meantime\r\nthe informers dragged Russell and Sydney into the scheme, for which they\r\nwere falsely put to death. Sir Thomas Armstrong, who had been taken at\r\nLeyden and delivered up to the English Ambassador at the Hague, claimed a\r\ntrial as a surrendered outlaw, according to the 6th Edward VI. But Judge\r\nJeffreys refused him his request, as he had not surrendered voluntarily,\r\nbut had been brought by force. Armstrong still claiming the benefit of the\r\nlaw, the brutal judge replied:--“And the benefit of the law you shall\r\nhave, by the grace of God. See that execution be done on Friday next,\r\naccording to law.”\r\n\r\nArmstrong had sinned deeply against the king. He had sold himself to the\r\nFrench ambassador, he had urged Monmouth on in his undutiful conduct to\r\nhis father, and he had been an active agent in the Rye House Plot. Charles\r\nwould listen to no voice in his favour. On the scaffold he denied any\r\nintention of assassinating the king or changing the form of\r\ngovernment.[13]\r\n\r\nSir William Perkins and Sir John Friend were the next unfortunate\r\ngentlemen who lent their heads to crown the Bar. They were rash,\r\nhot-headed Jacobites, who, too eagerly adopting the “ultima ratio” of\r\npolitical partisans, had planned, in 1696, to stop King William’s coach in\r\na deep lane between Brentford and Turnham Green, as he returned from\r\nhunting at Richmond. Sir John Friend was a person who had acquired wealth\r\nand credit from mean beginnings, but Perkins was a man of fortune,\r\nviolently attached to King James, though as one of the six clerks of\r\nChancery he had taken the oath to the new Government. Friend owned that he\r\nhad been at a treasonable meeting at the King’s Head Tavern in Leadenhall\r\nStreet, but denied connivance in the assassination-plot. Perkins made an\r\nartful and vigorous defence, but the judge acted as counsel for the Crown\r\nand guided the jury. They both suffered at Tyburn, three nonjuring\r\nclergymen absolving them, much to the indignation of the loyal\r\nbystanders.[14]\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn calls the sight of Temple Bar “a dismal sight.”[15] Thank God,\r\nthis revolting spectacle of traitors’ heads will never be seen here again.\r\n\r\nIn 1716 Colonel Henry Oxburgh’s head was added to the quarters of Sir\r\nJohn Friend (a brewer) and the skull of Sir William Perkins. Oxburgh was a\r\nLancashire gentleman, who had served in the French army. General Foster\r\n(who escaped from Newgate, in 1716) had made him colonel directly he\r\njoined the Pretender’s army. To him, too, had been entrusted the\r\nhumiliating task of proposing capitulation to the king’s troops at\r\nPreston, when the Highlanders, frenzied with despair, were eager to sally\r\nout and cut their way through the enemy’s dragoons. He met death with a\r\nserene temper. A fellow-prisoner described his words as coming “like a\r\ngleam from God. You received comfort,” he says, “from the man you came to\r\ncomfort.” Oxburgh was executed at Tyburn, May 14; his body was buried at\r\nSt. Giles’, all but his head, and that was placed on Temple Bar two days\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nA curious print of 1746 represents Temple Bar with the three heads raised\r\non tall poles or iron rods. The devil looks down in triumph and waves the\r\nrebel banner, on which are three crowns and a coffin, with the motto, “A\r\ncrown or a grave.” Underneath are written these wretched verses:\r\n\r\n  “Observe the banner which would all enslave,\r\n  Which ruined traytors did so proudly wave.\r\n  The devil seems the project to despise;\r\n  A fiend confused from off the trophy flies.\r\n\r\n  “While trembling rebels at the fabrick gaze,\r\n  And dread their fate with horror and amaze,\r\n  Let Briton’s sons the _emblematick_ view,\r\n  And plainly see what to rebellion’s due.”\r\n\r\nA curious little book “by a member of the Inner Temple,” which has\r\npreserved this print, has also embalmed the following stupid and\r\ncold-blooded impromptu on the heads of Oxburgh, Townley, and Fletcher:--\r\n\r\n  “Three heads here I spy,\r\n  Which the glass did draw nigh,\r\n    The better to have a good sight;\r\n  Triangle they’re placed,\r\n  Old, bald, and barefaced,\r\n    Not one of them e’er was upright.”[16]\r\n\r\nThe heads of Fletcher and Townley were put up on Temple Bar August 2,\r\n1746. On August 16, Walpole writes to Montague to say that he had “passed\r\nunder the new heads at Temple Bar, where people made a trade of letting\r\nspying-glasses at a halfpenny a look.”\r\n\r\nTownley was a young officer about thirty-eight years of age, born at\r\nWigan, and of a good family. His uncle had been out in 1715, but was\r\nacquitted on his trial. Townley had been fifteen years abroad in the\r\nFrench army, and was close to the Duke of Berwick when the duke’s head was\r\nshot off at the siege of Philipsburgh. When the Highlanders came into\r\nEngland he met them near Preston, and received from the young Pretender a\r\ncommission to raise a regiment of foot. He had been also commandant at\r\nCarlisle, and directed the sallies from thence.\r\n\r\nFletcher, a young linen chapman at Salford, had been seen pulling off his\r\nhat and shouting when a sergeant and a drummer were beating up for\r\nvolunteers at the Manchester Exchange. He had been seen also at Carlisle,\r\ndressed as an officer, with a white cockade in his hat and a plaid sash\r\nround his waist.[17]\r\n\r\nSeven other Jacobites were executed on Kennington Common with Fletcher and\r\nTownley. They were unchained from the floor of their room in Southwark new\r\ngaol early in the morning, and having taken coffee, had their irons\r\nknocked off. They were then, at about ten o’clock, put into three sledges,\r\neach drawn by three horses. The executioner, with a drawn scimitar, sat in\r\nthe first sledge with Townley; a party of dragoons and a detachment of\r\nfoot-guards conducted him to the gallows, near which a pile of faggots and\r\na block had been placed. While the prisoners were stepping from their\r\nsledges into a cart drawn up beneath a tree, the wood was set on fire, and\r\nthe guards formed a circle round the place of execution. The prisoners had\r\nno clergyman, but Mr. Morgan, one of their number, put on his spectacles\r\nand read prayers to them, which they listened and responded to with\r\ndevoutness. This lasted above an hour. Each one then threw his\r\nprayer-book and some written papers among the spectators; they also\r\ndelivered notes to the sheriff, and then flung their hats into the crowd.\r\n“Six of the hats,” says the quaint contemporary account, “were laced with\r\ngold,--all of these prisoners having been genteelly dressed.” Immediately\r\nafter, the executioner took a white cap from each man’s pocket and drew it\r\nover his eyes; then they were turned off. When they had hung about three\r\nminutes, the executioner pulled off their shoes, white stockings, and\r\nbreeches, a butcher removing their other clothes. The body of Mr. Townley\r\nwas then cut down and laid upon a block, and the butcher seeing some signs\r\nof life remaining, struck it on the breast, then took out the bowels and\r\nthe heart, and threw them into the fire. Afterwards, with a cleaver, they\r\nsevered the head and placed it with the body in the coffin. When the last\r\nheart, which was Mr. Dawson’s, was tossed into the fire, the executioner\r\ncried, “God save King George!” and the immense multitude gave a great\r\nshout. The heads and bodies were then removed to Southwark gaol to await\r\nthe king’s pleasure.\r\n\r\nAccording to another account the bodies were cloven into quarters; and as\r\nthe butcher held up each heart he cried, “Behold the heart of a traitor!”\r\n\r\nMr. James Dawson, one of the unhappy men thus cruelly punished, was a\r\nyoung Lancashire gentleman of fortune, just engaged to be married. The\r\nunhappy lady followed his sledge to the place of execution, and approached\r\nnear enough to see the fire kindled and all the other dreadful\r\npreparations. She bore it well till she heard her lover was no more, but\r\nthen drew her head back into the coach, and crying out, “My dear, I follow\r\nthee!--I follow thee! Sweet Jesus, receive our souls together!” fell on\r\nthe neck of a companion and expired. Shenstone commemorated this\r\noccurrence in a plaintive ballad called “Jemmy Dawson.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dawson is described as “a mighty gay gentleman, who frequented much\r\nthe company of the ladies, and was well respected by all his acquaintance\r\nof either sex for his genteel deportment. He was as strenuous for their\r\nvile cause as any one in the rebel army. When he was condemned and double\r\nfettered, he said he did not care if they were to put a ton weight of iron\r\non him; it would not in the least daunt his resolution.”[18]\r\n\r\nOn January 20 (between 2 and 3 A.M.), 1766, a man was taken up for\r\ndischarging musket-bullets from a steel crossbow at the two remaining\r\nheads upon Temple Bar. On being examined he affected a disorder in his\r\nsenses, and said his reason for doing so was “his strong attachment to the\r\npresent Government, and that he thought it was not sufficient that a\r\ntraitor should merely suffer death; that this provoked his indignation,\r\nand that it had been his constant practice for three nights past to amuse\r\nhimself in the same manner. And it is much to be feared,” says the\r\nrecorder of the event, “that he is a near relation to one of the unhappy\r\nsufferers.”[19] Upon searching this man, about fifty musket-bullets were\r\nfound on him, wrapped up in a paper with a motto--“Eripuit ille vitam.”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday,” says a news-writer of the 1st of April, 1772, “one of the\r\nrebel heads on Temple Bar fell down. There is only one head now\r\nremaining.”\r\n\r\nThe head that fell was probably that of Councillor Layer, executed for\r\nhigh treason in 1723. The blackened head was blown off the spike during a\r\nviolent storm. It was picked up by Mr. John Pearce, an attorney, one of\r\nthe Nonjurors of the neighbourhood, who showed it to some friends at a\r\npublic-house, under the floor of which it was buried. In the meanwhile Dr.\r\nRawlinson, a Jacobite antiquarian, having begged for the relic, was\r\nimposed on with another. In his will the doctor desired to be buried with\r\nthis head in his right hand,[20] and the request was complied with.\r\n\r\nThis Dr. Rawlinson, one of the first promoters of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, and son of a lord mayor of London, died in 1755. His body was\r\nburied in St. Giles’ churchyard, Oxford, and his heart in St. John’s\r\nCollege. The sale of his effects lasted several days, and produced £1164.\r\nHe left upwards of 20,000 pamphlets; his coins he bequeathed to Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe last of the iron poles or spikes on which the heads of the unfortunate\r\nJacobite gentlemen were fixed, was removed only at the commencement of the\r\npresent century.[21]\r\n\r\nThe above-named Christopher Layer was a barrister, living in Old\r\nSouthampton Buildings, who had engaged in a plot to seize the Bank and the\r\nTower, to arm the Minters in Southwark, to seize the king, Walpole, and\r\nLord Cadogan, to place cannon on the terrace of Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields\r\ngardens, and to draw a force of armed men together at the Exchange. The\r\nprisoner had received blank promissory-notes signed in the Pretender’s own\r\nhand, and also treasonable letters full of cant words of the party in\r\ndisguised names--such as Mr. Atkins for the Pretender, Mrs. Barbara Smith\r\nfor the army, and Mr. Fountaine for himself.\r\n\r\nIt was proved that, at an audience in Rome, Layer had assured the\r\nPretender that the South Sea losses had done good to his cause; and the\r\nPretender and the Pretender’s wife (through their proxies, Lord North and\r\nGrey, and the Duchess of Ormond) had stood as godfather and godmother to\r\nhis (Layer’s) daughter’s child.\r\n\r\nHe was executed at Tyburn in May 1723, and avowed his principles even\r\nunder the gallows. His head was taken to Newgate, and the next day fixed\r\nupon Temple Bar; but his quarters were delivered to his relations to be\r\ndecently interred.\r\n\r\nIn April 1773 Boswell dined at Mr. Beauclerk’s with Dr. Johnson, Lord\r\nCharlemont, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and some other members of the Literary\r\nClub--it being the evening when Boswell was to be balloted for as\r\ncandidate for admission into that distinguished society.[22] The\r\nconversation turned on Westminster Abbey, and on the new and commendable\r\npractice of erecting monuments to great men in St. Paul’s; upon which the\r\ndoctor observed--\r\n\r\n“I remember once being with Goldsmith in Westminster Abbey. While we\r\nsurveyed the Poets’ Corner, I said to him--\r\n\r\n  ‘Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur illis.’\r\n\r\nWhen we got to Temple Bar he stopped me, pointed to the heads upon it, and\r\nslily whispered--\r\n\r\n  ‘Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur _istis_.’”[23]\r\n\r\nThis walk must have taken place a year or two before 1773, for in 1772, as\r\nwe have seen, the last head but one fell.\r\n\r\nO’Keefe, the dramatist, who arrived in England on August 12, 1762, the day\r\non which the Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV.) was born, describes\r\nthe heads of poor Townley and Fletcher as stuck up on high poles, not over\r\nthe central archway, but over the side posterns. Parenthetically he\r\nmentions that he had also seen the walls of Cork gaol garnished with\r\nheads, like the ramparts of the seraglio at Constantinople.[24]\r\n\r\nO’Keefe tells us that he heard the unpopular peace of 1763 proclaimed at\r\nTemple Bar, and witnessed the heralds in the Strand knock at the city\r\ngate. The duke of Nivernois, the French ambassador on that occasion, was a\r\nvery little man, who wore a coat of richly-embroidered blue velvet, and a\r\nsmall _chapeau_, which set the fashion of the Nivernois hat.[25]\r\n\r\nAt the proclamation of the short peace of Amiens, the king’s marshal, with\r\nhis officers, having ridden down the Strand from Westminster, stopped at\r\nTemple Bar, which was kept shut to show that there commenced the Lord\r\nMayor’s jurisdiction. The herald’s trumpets were blown thrice; the junior\r\nofficer then tapped at the gate with his cane, upon which the City\r\nmarshal, in the most unconscious way possible, answered, “Who is there?”\r\nThe herald replied, “The officers-of-arms, who seek entrance into the City\r\nto publish his majesty’s proclamation of peace.” On this the gates were\r\nflung open, and the herald alone was admitted, and conducted to the Lord\r\nMayor. The latter then read the royal warrant, and returning it to the\r\nbearer, ordered the City marshal to open the gate for the whole\r\nprocession. The Lord Mayor and aldermen then joined it, and proceeded to\r\nthe Royal Exchange, where the proclamation, that was to bid the cannon\r\ncease and chain up the dogs of war, was read for the last time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LORD MAYOR’S SHOW. AFTER HOGARTH.]\r\n\r\nThe timber work and doors of Temple Bar have been often renewed since\r\n1672. New doors were hung for Nelson’s funeral, when the Bar was to be\r\nclosed; and again at the funeral of Wellington, when the plumes and\r\ntrophies had to be removed in order that the car might pass through the\r\ngate, which was covered with dull theatrical finery.[26]\r\n\r\nThe old, black, mud-splashed gates of Temple Bar are also shut whenever\r\nthe sovereign has occasion to enter the City. This is an old custom, a\r\ntradition of the times when the city was proud of its privileges, and\r\nsometimes even jealous of royalty. When the cavalcade approaches, a\r\nherald, in his tabard of crimson and gold lace, sounds a trumpet before\r\nthe portal of the City; another herald knocks; a parley ensues; the gates\r\nare then thrown open, and the Lord Mayor appearing, kneels and hands the\r\nsword of the city to his sovereign, who graciously returns it.\r\n\r\nStow describes a scene like this in the old days of the “timber house,”\r\nwhen Queen Elizabeth was on her way to old St. Paul’s to return thanks to\r\nGod for the discomfiture of the Armada. The City waits fluted, trumpeted,\r\nand fiddled from the roof of the gate; while below, the Lord Mayor and his\r\nbrethren, in scarlet gowns, received and welcomed their brave queen,\r\ndelivering up the sword which, after certain speeches, she re-delivered to\r\nthe mayor, who, then taking horse, rode onward to St. Paul’s bearing it in\r\nits shining sheath before her.[27]\r\n\r\nIn the June after the execution of Charles I., when Cromwell had dispersed\r\nthe mutinous regiments with his horse, and pistolled or hanged their\r\nleaders, a day of thanksgiving was appointed, and the Parliament, the\r\nCouncil of State, and the Council of the Army, after endless sermons,\r\ndined together at Grocers’ Hall; on that day Lenthall, the Speaker,\r\nreceived the sword of state from the mayor at the Bar, and assumed the\r\nfunctions of royalty.\r\n\r\nThe same ceremony took place when Queen Anne went to St. Paul’s to return\r\nthanks for the Duke of Marlborough’s victories, and again when George III.\r\ncame to return thanks for a recovery from his fit of insanity, and when\r\nQueen Victoria passed on her way to Cornhill to open the Royal Exchange.\r\n\r\nTemple Bar naturally does not figure much in the early City pageants,\r\nbecause, after proceeding to Westminster by water, the mayor and aldermen\r\nusually landed at St. Paul’s Stairs.\r\n\r\nIt is, we believe, first mentioned in the great festivities when the City\r\nbrought poor Anne Boleyn, in 1533, from Greenwich to the Tower, and on the\r\nsecond day after conducted her through the chief streets and honoured her\r\nwith shows. On that day the Fleet Street conduit ran claret, and Temple\r\nBar was newly painted and repaired; there also stood singing men and\r\nchildren, till the company rode on to Westminster Hall. The next day was\r\nthe coronation.[28]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February 1546-7 the young King Edward VI. passed through\r\nLondon, the day before his coronation. At the Fleet Street conduit two\r\nhogsheads of wine were given to the people. The gate at Temple Bar was\r\nalso painted and fashioned with varicoloured battlements and buttresses,\r\nrichly hung with cloth of arras, and garnished with fourteen standards.\r\nThere were eight French trumpeters blowing their best, besides a pair of\r\n“regals,” with children singing to the same.[29]\r\n\r\nIn September 1553 Queen Mary rode through London, the day before her\r\ncoronation, in a chariot covered with cloth of tissue, and drawn by six\r\nhorses draped with the same. Minstrels played at Ludgate, and the Temple\r\nBar was newly painted and hung.[30]\r\n\r\nBut even a greater time came for the old City boundary in January 1558-9,\r\nwhen Queen Elizabeth went from the Tower to Westminster. Temple Bar was\r\n“finely dressed” up with the two giants--Gog and Magog (now in the\r\nGuildhall)--who held between them a poetical recapitulation of all the\r\nother pageantries, both in Latin and English. On the south side was a\r\nnoise of singing children, one of whom, richly attired as a poet, gave the\r\nqueen farewell in the name of the whole city.[31]\r\n\r\nIn 1603 King James, Queen Anne of Denmark, and Prince Henry Frederick\r\npassed through “the honourable City and Chamber” of London, and were\r\nwelcomed with pageants. The last arch, that of Temple Bar, represented a\r\ntemple of Janus. The principal character was Peace, with War grovelling at\r\nher feet; by her stood Wealth; below sat the four handmaids of\r\nPeace,--Quiet treading on Tumult, Liberty on Servitude, Safety on Danger,\r\nand Felicity on Unhappiness. There was then recited a poetical dialogue by\r\nthe Flamen Martialis and the Genius Urbis, written by Ben Jonson.\r\n\r\nHere, hitherto, the pageantry had always ceased, but the Strand suburbs\r\nhaving now greatly increased, there was an additional pageant beyond\r\nTemple Bar, which had been thought of and perfected in only twelve days.\r\nThe invention was a rainbow; and the moon, sun, and pleiades advanced\r\nbetween two magnificent pyramids seventy feet high, on which were drawn\r\nout the king’s pedigrees through both the English and the Scottish\r\nmonarchs. A speech composed by Ben Jonson was delivered by Electra.[32]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles II. came through London, according to custom, the day before\r\nhis coronation, I suspect that “the fourth arch in Fleet Street” was close\r\nto Temple Bar. It was of the Doric and Ionic orders, and was dedicated to\r\nPlenty, who made a speech, surrounded by Bacchus, Ceres, Flora, Pomona,\r\nand the Winds; but whether the latter were alive or only dummies, I cannot\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nThe _London Gazette_ of February 8, 1665-6, announces the proclamation of\r\nwar against France; and Pepys mentions this as also the day on which they\r\nwent into mourning at court for the King of Spain. War was proclaimed by\r\nthe herald-at-arms and two of his brethren, his majesty’s\r\nsergeants-at-arms, and trumpeters, with the other usual officers before\r\nWhitehall, and afterwards (the Lord Mayor and his brethren assisting) at\r\nTemple Bar, and in other usual parts of the City.\r\n\r\nJames II., in 1687, honoured Sir John Shorter as Lord Mayor with his\r\npresence at an inaugurative banquet at Guildhall. The king was accompanied\r\nby Prince George of Denmark, and was met by the two sheriffs at Temple\r\nBar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE BAR, 1746.]\r\n\r\nOn Lord Mayor’s Day, 1689, when King William and Queen Mary came to the\r\nCity to see the show, the City militia regiments lined the street as far\r\nas Temple Bar, and beyond came the red and blue regiments of Middlesex and\r\nWestminster; the soldiers, at regulated distances, holding lighted\r\nflambeaux in their hands, and all the houses being illuminated.[33]\r\n\r\nIn 1697, when Macaulay’s hero, William III., made a triumphant entry into\r\nLondon to celebrate the conclusion of the peace of Ryswick, the procession\r\nincluded fourscore state coaches, each with six horses; the three City\r\nregiments guarded Temple Bar, and beyond them came the liveries of the\r\nseveral companies, with their banners and ensigns displayed.[34]\r\n\r\nGeorge III. in his day, and Queen Victoria in her and our own, passed\r\nthrough Temple Bar in state more than once, on their way into the City;\r\nthe last occasion was on February 1872, when the Queen proceeded to St.\r\nPaul’s to offer thanks for the recovery of her son the Prince of Wales.\r\nThrough it also the bodies of Nelson and of Wellington were borne to their\r\nlast resting place in St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\nOn the auspicious entrance into London of the fair Princess Alexandra, the\r\nold gate was hung with tapestry of gold tissue, powdered with crimson\r\nhearts; and very mediæval and gorgeous it looked; but the real days of\r\npageants are gone by. We shall never again see fountains running wine, nor\r\nmaidens blowing gold-leaf into the air, as in the luxurious days of our\r\nPlantagenet kings.\r\n\r\nThere are many portals in the world loftier and more beautiful than our\r\ndull, black arch of Temple Bar. The Vatican has grander doorways, the\r\nLouvre more stately entrances, but through no gateway in the world have\r\nsurely passed onwards to death so many millions of wise and brave men, or\r\nso many thinkers who have urged forward learning and civilisation, and\r\ncarried the standard of struggling humanity farther into space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. CLEMENT’S CHURCH IN THE STRAND, 1753.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE STRAND (SOUTH SIDE).\r\n\r\n\r\nEssex Street was formerly part of the Outer Temple, the western wing of\r\nthe Knight Templars’ quarter. The outer district of these proud and\r\nwealthy Crusaders stretched as far as the present Devereux Court; those\r\ngentler spoilers, the mediæval lawyers, having extended their frontiers\r\nquite as far as their rooted-out predecessors. From the Prior and Canons\r\nof the Holy Sepulchre[35] it was transferred, in the reign of Edward II.\r\nto the Bishops of Exeter, who built a palace here and occupied it till the\r\nreign of Henry VII. or Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe first tenant of Exeter House was the ill-fated Walter Stapleton, Lord\r\nTreasurer of England, a firm adherent to the luckless Edward II., against\r\nhis queen and the turbulent barons. In 1326, when Isabella landed from\r\nFrance to chase the Spensers from her husband’s side, and advanced on\r\nLondon, the weak king and his evil counsellors fled to the Welsh frontier;\r\nbut the bishop held out stoutly for his king, and, as custos of the City\r\nof London, demanded the keys from the Lord Mayor, Hammond Chickwell, to\r\nprevent the treachery of the disaffected city. The watchful populace,\r\nroused by Isabella’s proclamation that had been hung on the new cross in\r\nCheapside, rose in arms, seized the vacillating mayor, and took the keys.\r\nThey next ran to Exeter House, then newly erected, fired the gates, and\r\nburnt all the plate, jewels, money, and goods. The bishop, at that time in\r\nthe fields, being almost too proud to show fear, rode straight to the\r\nnorthern door of St. Paul’s to take sanctuary. There the mob tore him from\r\nhis horse, stripped him of his armour, and dragging him to Cheapside,\r\nproclaimed him a traitor, a seducer of the king, and an enemy of their\r\nliberties, and lopping off his head, set it on a pole. The corpse was\r\nburied without funeral service in an old churchyard of the Pied\r\nFriars.[36] His brother and some servants were also beheaded, and their\r\nbleeding and naked bodies thrown on a heap of rubbish by the river side.\r\n\r\nExeter Place was shortly afterwards rebuilt, but the new house seemed a\r\ndoomed place, and brought no better fortune to its new owners. Lord Paget,\r\nwho changed its name to Paget House, fought at Boulogne under the poet\r\nEarl of Surrey, was ambassador at the court of Charles V., and on his\r\nreturn obtained a peerage and the garter. He fell with the Protector\r\nSomerset, being accused of having planned the assassination of the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland at Paget House. Released from the Tower, he was deprived of\r\nthe garter upon the malicious pretence that he was not a gentleman by\r\nblood. Queen Mary, however, restored the fallen man to honour, made him\r\nLord Privy Seal, and sent him on an embassy.\r\n\r\nThe next occupier of the unlucky house, Thomas Howard, fourth Duke of\r\nNorfolk, and son of the poet Earl of Surrey, maintained in its chambers an\r\nalmost royal magnificence. It was here he was arrested for conspiring,\r\nwith the aid of Mary Queen of Scots, the Pope, and the King of Spain, to\r\nmarry Mary and restore the Popish religion.\r\n\r\nThe duke’s ambition and treason were fully proved by his own intercepted\r\nletters; indeed, he himself confessed his guilt, though he had denounced\r\nMary to Elizabeth as a “notorious adulteress and murderer.” To crown his\r\nrashness, meanness, and treason, he wrote from the Tower the most abject\r\nletters to Elizabeth, imploring her clemency. He was privately beheaded in\r\n1572, but his estates were restored to his children.[37] It was under the\r\nmat, hard by a window in the entry towards the duke’s bedchamber, that the\r\ncelebrated alphabet in cipher[38] was hidden, which the duke afterwards\r\nconcealed under a roof tile, where it was found, unmasking all his plans.\r\n\r\nIn the Tower the unhappy plotter had written affecting letters to his son\r\nPhilip, bidding him worship God, avoid courts, and beware of ambition.[39]\r\nThe warning of the man whose eyes had been opened too late is touching.\r\nThe writer, speaking of court life, remarks, “It hath no certainty. Either\r\na man, by following thereof, hath too much worldly pomp, which in the end\r\nthrows him down headlong, or else he liveth there unsatisfied, either that\r\nhe cannot obtain to himself that he would, or else that he cannot do for\r\nhis friends as his heart desireth.”\r\n\r\nPoor Philip did not benefit much by these lessons, but remained simple\r\nEarl of Arundel, was repeatedly committed to the Tower, as by necessity an\r\nill-wisher to Elizabeth, and eventually died there after ten weary years\r\nof imprisonment. His initials are still to be found on the walls of one of\r\nthe chambers in the Beauchamp Tower.\r\n\r\nFools never learn the lessons which Time tries so hard to beat into them.\r\nPlotter succeeds plotter, and the rough lesson of the headsman seldom\r\nteaches the conspirator’s successor to cease from conspiring.\r\n\r\nTo the Norfolks succeeded Dudley, the false Earl of Leicester, the black\r\nor gipsy earl, as he was called from his swarthy Italian complexion.\r\nLeicester, like the duke before him, plotted with Mary’s Jesuits and\r\nassassins, and at the same time contrived to keep in favour with his own\r\njealous queen, in spite of all his failures and schemings in Holland, and\r\nhis suspected assassinations of his enemies in England. Leicester died of\r\nfever the year of the Armada (1588), on his return from the camp at\r\nTilbury, leaving Leicester Place to Robert Devereux, his step-son, the\r\nEarl of Essex,[40] who succeeded to his favour at court, but was doomed to\r\nan untimely death.\r\n\r\nIt was to the great Lord of Kenilworth--that dark, mysterious man, who\r\nperhaps deserved more praise than historians usually give him--that\r\nSpenser dedicated his poem of “Virgil’s Gnat.” In his beautiful\r\n“Prothalamion” on the marriage of Lady Elizabeth and Lady Catherine\r\nSomerset, he speaks somewhat abjectly of Leicester, ingeniously contriving\r\nto remind Essex of his father-in-law’s bounty. “Near to the Temple,” the\r\nneedy poet says,\r\n\r\n              “Stands a stately place,\r\n  _Where I gayned giftes_ and the goodly grace\r\n  Of that great lord who there was wont to dwell,\r\n  Whose want too well now feels my friendless case;\r\n  But, ah! here fits not well\r\n  Old woes.”\r\n\r\nThen the poet goes on to eulogise Essex, who, however, it is supposed,\r\nafter all allowed him to die in want. But there is a mystery about\r\nSpenser’s death. He returned from Ireland, beggared and almost\r\nbroken-hearted, in October or November 1599, and died in the January\r\nfollowing, just as Essex was preparing to start to Ireland. In that whirl\r\nof ambition, the poor poet may perhaps have been rather overlooked than\r\nwilfully slighted. This at least is certain, that he was buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey, near Chaucer’s tomb, the Earl of Essex defraying the\r\nexpenses of his public funeral.\r\n\r\nIt was in his prison-house near the Temple that the hair-brained Earl of\r\nEssex shut himself sulkily up, when Queen Elizabeth had given him a box on\r\nthe ears, after a dispute about the new deputy for Ireland, in which the\r\nearl had shown a petulant violence unworthy of the pupil of Burleigh.\r\n\r\nFar too much sympathy has been shown with this rash, imperious, and\r\nunbearable young noble. He was sent to Ireland, and there concluded a\r\ndisgraceful, wilful, and traitorous treaty with one of England’s most\r\ninveterate and dangerous enemies. He returned from that “cursedest of all\r\nislands,” as he called it, against express command, and was with\r\ndifficulty dissuaded from landing in open rebellion. Generous and frank he\r\nmay have been, but his submission to the mild and well-deserved punishment\r\nof confinement to his own house was as base and abject as it was false and\r\nhypocritical.\r\n\r\nAlarmed, mortified, and enraged at the duration of his banishment from\r\ncourt, and at the refusal of a renewed grant for the monopoly of sweet\r\nwines, Essex betook himself to open rebellion, urged on by ill-advisers\r\nand his own reckless impatient spirit. He invited the Puritan preachers to\r\nprayers and sermons; he plotted with the King of Scotland. It was arranged\r\nat secret meetings at Drury House (then Sir Charles Daver’s) to seize\r\nWhitehall and compel the queen to dismiss Cecil and other ministers\r\nhostile to Essex.\r\n\r\nSir Christopher Blount was to seize the palace gates, Davies the hall,\r\nDavers the guard-room and presence-chamber, while Essex, rushing in from\r\nthe Mews with some hundred and twenty adherents, was to compel the queen\r\nto assemble a parliament to dismiss his enemies, and to fix the\r\nsuccession. All these plans were proposed to Essex in writing--the\r\narch-conspirator was never himself present.\r\n\r\nThe delay of letters from Scotland led to the premature outbreak of the\r\nplot. An order was at once sent summoning Essex to the council, and the\r\npalace guards were doubled.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, February 7, 1601, Essex, fearing instant arrest, assembled his\r\nfriends, and determined to arm and sally forth to St. Paul’s Cross, where\r\nthe Lord Mayor and aldermen were hearing the sermon, and urge them to\r\nfollow him to the palace. On the Lord Keeper and other noblemen coming to\r\nthe house to know the cause of the assembly, Essex locked them into a back\r\nparlour, guarded by musketeers, and followed by two hundred gentlemen,\r\ndrew his sword and rushed into the street like a madman “running a-muck.”\r\n\r\nTemple Bar was opened for him; but at St. Paul’s Cross he found no\r\nmeeting. The citizens crowded round him, but did not join his band. When\r\nhe reached the house of Sheriff Smith, the crafty Sheriff had stolen away.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Lord Burleigh and the Earl of Cumberland, with a herald,\r\nhad entered the City and proclaimed Essex a traitor; a thousand pounds\r\nbeing offered for his apprehension. Despairing of success, the mad earl\r\nthen turned towards his own house, and finding Ludgate barricaded by a\r\nstrong party of citizens under Sir John Levison, attempted to force his\r\nway, killing two or three citizens, and losing Tracy, a young friend of\r\nhis own. Then striking down to Queenhithe, the earl and some fifty\r\nfollowers who were left took boat for Essex Gardens.\r\n\r\nOn entering his house, he found that his treacherous confidant, Sir\r\nFerdinand Gorges, had made terms with the court and released the hostages.\r\nEssex then, by the advice of Lord Sandys, resolved to fortify the place,\r\nhold out to the last extremity, and die sword in hand. In a few minutes,\r\nhowever, the Lord Admiral’s troops surrounded the building. A parley\r\nensued between Sir Robert Sidney in the garden, and Essex and his rash\r\nally, Shakspere’s patron, the Earl of Southampton, who were on the roof.\r\nThe earl’s demands were proudly refused, but a respite of two hours was\r\ngiven him, that the ladies and female servants might retire. About six\r\nthe battering train arrived from the Tower, and Essex then wisely\r\nsurrendered at discretion.[41]\r\n\r\nThe night being very dark, and the tide not serving to pass the dangers of\r\nLondon Bridge, Essex and Southampton were taken by boat to Lambeth Palace,\r\nand the next morning to the Tower.\r\n\r\nEssex had fully deserved death. He was executed privately, by his own\r\nrequest, at the Tower, February 25, 1601. Meyrick, his steward, and Cuffe,\r\nhis secretary, were hanged and quartered at Tyburn. Sir Charles Davers and\r\nSir Christopher Blount perished on Tower Hill. Other prisoners were fined\r\nand imprisoned, and the Earl of Southampton pined in durance till the\r\naccession of James I. (1603).\r\n\r\nAmong the even older tenants of Essex House, we must not forget that\r\nunhappy woman, the earl’s mother, who, first as Lettice Knollys, then as\r\nCountess of Essex, afterwards as Lady Leicester, and next as wife of Sir\r\nChristopher Blount, was a barb in Elizabeth’s side for thirty years.\r\nMarried as a girl to a noble husband, she gave up her honour to a seducer,\r\nand there is reason to think that she consented to the taking of his life.\r\nWhile Devereux lived, she deceived the queen by a scandalous amour, and,\r\nafter his death, by a clandestine marriage with the Earl of Leicester.\r\nWhile Dudley lived, she wallowed in licentious love with Christopher\r\nBlount, his groom of the horse. When her second husband expired in agony\r\nat Cornbury, not an hour’s gallop from the place in which Amy Robsart\r\ndied, she again mortified the queen by a secret union with her last\r\nseducer, Blount. Her children rioted in the same vices. Essex himself,\r\nwith his ring of favourites, was not more profligate than his sister\r\nPenelope, Lady Rich.[42]\r\n\r\nThis sister was the (Platonic?) mistress of Sydney, whose stolen love for\r\nher is pictured in his most voluptuous verse. On his death at Zütphen, she\r\nlived with Lord Montjoy, though her husband, Lord Rich, was still alive.\r\nNor was her sister Dorothy one whit better. After marrying one husband\r\nsecretly and against the canon, she wedded Percy, the wizard Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, whom she led the life of a dog, until he indignantly\r\nturned her out of doors.[43] It is not easy, observes Mr. Dixon, except in\r\nItalian story, to find a group of women so depraved and so detestable as\r\nthe mother and sisters of the Earl of Essex.\r\n\r\nEssex, the rash noble, who died at the untimely age of thirty-three, had a\r\ndangerous, ill-tempered face, if we may judge by More’s portrait of him.\r\nHe stooped in walking, danced badly, and was slovenly in his dress;[44]\r\nyet being a generous, frank friend, an impetuous and chivalrous if not\r\nwise soldier, and an enemy of Spain and the Cecils, he became a favourite\r\nof the people. The legend of the ring sent by Essex to the queen,[45] and\r\nmaliciously detained by the Countess of Nottingham, we shall presently\r\ndiscuss. No applications for mercy by Essex (and he made many during his\r\ntrial) affect the question of his deserving death. That the queen\r\nconsented with regret to the death of Essex, on the other hand, needs no\r\ndoubtful legend to serve as proof.\r\n\r\nElizabeth had forgiven the earl’s joining the Cadiz fleet against her\r\nwish, she forgave his secret marriage, she forgave his shameful\r\nabandonment of his Irish command and even his dishonourable treaty with\r\nTyrone, but she could not forgive an open and flagrant rebellion at a time\r\nwhen she was so surrounded by enemies.\r\n\r\nAn historical writer, gifted with an eminently analytical mind, Mr.\r\nHepworth Dixon, has lately, with great ingenuity, endeavoured to refute\r\nthe charges of ingratitude brought against Bacon for his time serving and\r\n(to say the least) undue eagerness in aggravating the crimes of his old\r\nand generous friend. There can be, however, no doubt that Bacon too soon\r\nabandoned the unfortunate Essex, and, moreover, threw the weight of much\r\nmisapplied learning into the scale against the prisoner. No minimising of\r\nthe favours received by him from Essex can in my mind remove this stain\r\nfrom Bacon’s reputation.\r\n\r\nIn Essex House was born a less brilliant but a happier and a more prudent\r\nman--Robert, Earl of Essex, afterwards the well-known Parliamentary\r\ngeneral. A child when his father died on the scaffold, he was placed under\r\nthe care of his grandmother, Lady Walsingham, and was afterwards at Eton\r\nunder the severe Saville. A good, worthy, heavy lad, brought up a\r\nPresbyterian, he was betrothed when only fourteen to Lady Frances Howard,\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Suffolk, who was herself only thirteen.\r\n\r\nThe earl travelled on the Continent for four years, and on his return was\r\nmarried at Essex House. It was for this inauspicious marriage that Ben\r\nJonson wrote one of his most beautiful and gorgeous masques, Inigo Jones\r\ncontributing the machinery, and Ferrabosco the music. The rough-grained\r\npoet seems to have been delighted with the success of the entertainment,\r\nfor he says, “Nor was there wanting whatsoever might give to the furniture\r\na complement, either in riches or strangeness of the habits, delicacy of\r\ndances, magnificence of the scene, or divine rapture of music.”[46]\r\n\r\nThe countess was already, even at this time, the mistress of Robert Carr,\r\nthe handsome minion of James I. She obtained a divorce from her husband in\r\n1613, and espoused her infamous lover. The cruel poisoning of Sir Thomas\r\nOverbury for opposing the new marriage followed; and the earl and\r\ncountess, found guilty, but spared by the weak king, lingered out their\r\nlives in mutual reproaches and contempt, loathed and neglected by all.\r\nFate often runs in sequences--the earl was unhappy with his second wife,\r\nfrom whom he also was divorced.\r\n\r\nEssex emerged from a country retirement to turn general for the\r\nParliament. Just, affable, and prudent, he was a popular man till he\r\nbecame marked as a moderatist desirous for peace, and was ousted by the\r\nartful “Self-denying Ordinance.” If he had lived it is probable he would\r\neither have lost his head or have fled to France and turned cavalier. His\r\ndeath during the time that Charles I. remained a prisoner with the Scotch\r\narmy at Newcastle saved him from either fate. With him the Presbyterian\r\nmoderatists and the House of Peers finally lost even their little\r\nremaining power.\r\n\r\nWhen the earl resigned his commission, the House of Commons went to Essex\r\nHouse to return their ex-general thanks for his great services. A year\r\nlater they followed him to the grave (1646), little perhaps thinking how\r\nbitterly the earl had reproached them for ingratitude, and what plans he\r\nhad devised to reform the army and to check Cromwell and Fairfax.[47]\r\n\r\nOn the earl’s death, his Royalist brother-in-law, the Marquis of Hertford,\r\nattempted to seize his ready money and papers, but was frustrated by the\r\nParliament.[48]\r\n\r\nWhether the next earl, who on being arrested for sharing in the Rye-House\r\nplot destroyed himself at the Tower, lived in his father’s house, I do not\r\nknow, but the mansion, so unlucky to its owners, was occupied by families\r\nof rank for some time after the Restoration, and then falling into neglect\r\nand ruin, as fashion began to flow westward, was subdivided, and a street,\r\ncalled Essex Street, was built on part of its site.\r\n\r\nSamuel Patterson, the bookseller and auctioneer, lived in Essex Street, in\r\n1775, in rooms formerly the residence of Sir Orlando Bridgeman. He was\r\noriginally a bag-maker. Afterwards Charles Dibdin commenced his\r\nentertainments in these rooms, and here his fine song of “Poor Jack”\r\nbecame famous.[49] Patterson’s youngest child was Dr. Johnson’s godson,\r\nand became a pupil of Ozias Humphrey.[50] Patterson wrote a book of\r\ntravels in Sterne’s manner, but claimed a priority to that strange writer.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fordyce, a celebrated epicurean doctor of the eighteenth century,\r\nlived in the same street. For twenty years he dined daily at Dolly’s\r\nChop-house, and at his solitary meal he always took a tankard of strong\r\nale, a quarter of a pint of brandy, and a bottle of port. After these\r\npotations, he walked to his house and gave a lecture to his pupils.[51]\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson, the year before he died, formed a club in Essex Street, at\r\nthe Essex Head, a tavern kept by an old servant of his friend, Thrale, the\r\nbrewer. It was less select than the Literary Club, but cheaper. Johnson,\r\nwriting to Sir Joshua Reynolds to join it, says, “the terms are lax and\r\nthe expences light--we meet thrice a week, and he who misses forfeits\r\ntwopence.”[52] Sir John Hawkins spitefully calls it “a low ale-house\r\nassociation;” but Windham, Daines Barrington, Horsley, Boswell, and\r\nBrocklesby were members of it; for rich men were less luxurious than they\r\nare now, and enjoyed the sociable freedom of a tavern. Sir Joshua refused\r\nto join, probably because Barry, who had insulted him, and was very\r\npugnacious, had become a member.[53] It went on happily for many years,\r\nsays Boswell, whom Johnson, when he proposed him for election, called “a\r\nclubable man.” Towards the end of his life the great lexicographer grew\r\nmore and more afraid of solitude, and a club so near his home was probably\r\na great convenience to him.\r\n\r\nNear Devereux Court are the premises of the well-known tea-dealers,\r\nMessrs. Twining. The graceful recumbent stone figures of Chinamen over the\r\nStrand front have much elegance, and must have come from some good hand.\r\nOne of this family was a Colchester rector, and a translator of\r\nAristotle’s _Poetics_. He was an excellent man, a good linguist and\r\nmusician, and a witty companion. He was contemporary with Gray and Mason,\r\nthe poets, at Cambridge. In the back parlour is a portrait of the founder\r\nof the house. A century and a half ago ladies used to drive to the door of\r\nTwining’s and drink tiny cups of the new and fashionable beverage as they\r\nsat in their coaches. There is an epigram extant, written either by\r\nTheodore Hook or one of the Smiths; the point of it is, that if you took\r\naway his T, Twining would be Wining.\r\n\r\nIn 1652 Constantine, the Greek servant of a Levant merchant, opened in\r\nDevereux Court a coffee-house, which became known as “The Grecian.” In\r\n1664-5 advertised his Turkey “coffee bery,” chocolate, “sherbet,” and tea,\r\nas good and cheap, and announced his readiness to give gratuitous\r\ninstructions in the art of preparing the said liquors.[54]\r\n\r\nIn the same year, a Greek named Pasqua Rosee had also established a house\r\nin St. Michael’s Alley, Cornhill, for the sale of “the coffee drink.”[55]\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn describes a Greek fellow-student, afterwards Bishop of Smyrna,\r\ndrinking coffee when he was at college in about 1637.[56]\r\n\r\nIn April 1709 Steele, in No. 1 of the _Tatler_, announces that he shall\r\ndate all learned articles from the “Grecian,” all gallantry from\r\n“White’s,” all poetry from “Wills’s,” all foreign and domestic news from\r\n“St. James’s.”\r\n\r\nIn 1710-11 Addison, starting the “_Spectator_ along with Steele,” tells us\r\nhis own grave face was well known at the Grecian; and in No. 49 (April\r\n1711), the _Spectator_ describes the spleen and inward laughter with which\r\nhe views at the Grecian the young Templars come in, about 8 A.M., either\r\ndressed for Westminster, and with the preoccupied air of assumed business,\r\nor in gay cap, slippers, and particoloured dressing-gowns, rising early to\r\npublish their laziness, and being displaced by busier men towards noon.\r\nDr. King relates a story of two hot-blooded young gentlemen quarrelling\r\none evening at this coffee-house about the accent of a Greek word.\r\nStepping out into Devereux Court, they fought, and one of them being run\r\nthrough the body, died on the spot.[57] This Dr. King was principal of St.\r\nMary’s Hall, Oxford, and a staunch Tory. It is he who relates the secret\r\nvisit of the Pretender to London. He died in 1763.\r\n\r\nRalph Thoresby, the Leeds topographer, met Dr. Sloane, the secretary of\r\nthe Royal Society, by appointment at the Grecian in May 1712; and again in\r\nJune he describes retiring to the Grecian after a meeting of the Royal\r\nSociety, of which he was a fellow, with the president, Sir Isaac\r\nNewton,[58] Dr. Halley, who published the _Principia_ for Newton, and\r\nKeill, who opposed Leibnitz about the invention of Fluxions, and defended\r\nNewton’s doctrines against the Cartesians. (The Royal Society held its\r\nmeetings at this time in Crane Court, Fleet Street.) Roger North,\r\nAttorney-General under James II., who died in 1733, describes in his\r\n_Examen_ the Privy Council Board, as held at the Grecian coffee-house. The\r\nGrecian was closed in 1843, and has been since turned into the Grecian\r\nChambers. On what was once the front of the coffee-house frequented by\r\nSteele and Addison, there is a bust of Essex, with the date 1676.\r\n\r\nIn this court, at the house of one Kedder, in 1678, died Marchmont\r\nNeedham, a vigorous but unprincipled turncoat and newspaper writer, who\r\nthree times during the civil wars changed his principles to save his\r\nworthless neck. He was alternately the author of the _Mercurius\r\nBritannicus_ for the Presbyterians, _Mercurius Pragmaticus_ for the king,\r\nand _Mercurius Politicus_ for the Independents. The great champion of the\r\nlate usurper, as the Cavaliers called him, “whose pen, compared with\r\nothers’, was as a weaver’s beam,” latterly practised as a physician, but\r\nwith small success.[59]\r\n\r\nThere is a letter of Pope addressed to Fortescue, his “counsel learned in\r\nthe law,” at Tom’s coffee-house, in Devereux Court. Fortescue, the poet’s\r\nkind, unpaid lawyer, was afterwards (in 1738) Master of the Rolls. Pope’s\r\nimitation of the first satire of Horace, suggested by Bolingbroke, was\r\naddressed to Mr. Fortescue, and published in 1733. This lawyer was the\r\nauthor of the droll report in _Scriblerus_ of “Stradling _versus_ Styles,”\r\nwherein Sir John Swale leaves all his black and white horses to one\r\nStradling, but the question is whether this bequest includes Swale’s\r\npiebald horses. It is finally proved that the horses are all mares.[60]\r\n\r\nDr. Birch, the antiquary, the dull writer but good talker, frequented\r\nTom’s; and there Akenside--short, thin, pale, strumous, and lame,\r\nscrupulously neat, and somewhat petulant, vain, and irritable--spent his\r\nwinter evenings, entangled in disputes and altercations, chiefly on\r\nsubjects of literature and politics, that fixed on his character the stamp\r\nof haughtiness and self-conceit, and drew him into disagreeable\r\nsituations.[61] Akenside was a contradictory man. By turns he was placid,\r\nirritable; simple, affected; gracious, haughty; magnanimous, mean;\r\nbenevolent, yet harsh, and sometimes even brutal. At times he manifested a\r\nchildlike docility, and at other times his vanity and arrogance made him\r\nseem almost a madman.[62]\r\n\r\nGay, in his _Trivia_, describes Milford Lane so faithfully that it might\r\npass for a yesterday’s sketch of the same place. He writes--\r\n\r\n  “Where the fair columns of St. Clement stand,\r\n  Whose straitened bounds incroach upon the Strand;\r\n  Where the low pent-house bows the walker’s head,\r\n  And the rough pavement wounds the yielding tread;\r\n  Where not a post protects the narrow space,\r\n  And strung in twines combs dangle in thy face.\r\n  Summon at once thy courage--rouse thy care;\r\n  Stand firm, look back, be resolute, beware!\r\n  Forth issuing from steep lanes, the collier’s steeds\r\n  Drag the black load; another cart succeeds;\r\n  Team follows team, crowds heap’d on crowds appear.”\r\n\r\nStow mentions Milford Lane, but gives no derivation for its name.[63] The\r\ncoarse poem by Henry Savill, commonly attributed to the witty Earl of\r\nDorset, beginning--\r\n\r\n  “In Milford Lane, near to St. Clement’s steeple.”[64]\r\n\r\ngave the street for a time such a disagreeable notoriety as the pillory\r\ngives to a rogue.\r\n\r\nArundel House, in the Strand, was the old inn or town-house of the Bishops\r\nof Bath, stolen by force in the rough, greedy times of Edward VI., by the\r\nbad Lord Thomas Seymour, the admiral, and the brother of the Protector;\r\nfrom him it derived the name of Seymour Place, and must have been\r\nconveniently near to the ambitious kinsman who afterwards beheaded him.\r\nThis Admiral had married Henry VIII.’s widow, Catherine Parr; and she\r\ndying in childbed, he began to woo, in his coarse boisterous way, the\r\nyoung Princess Elizabeth, who had been living under the protection of her\r\nmother-in-law, who was indeed generally supposed to have been poisoned by\r\nthe admiral. His marriage with Elizabeth would have smoothed his way to\r\nthe throne in spite of her father’s cautious will. It was said that\r\nElizabeth always blushed when she heard his name. He died on the scaffold.\r\nOld Bishop Latimer, in a sermon, declared “he was a wicked man, and the\r\nrealm is well rid of him.”[65] It is certain that, whatever were his\r\nplots, he had projected a marriage between Lady Jane Grey and the young\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThe admiral’s house was bought, on its owner’s fall, by Henry Fitz-Alan,\r\nEarl of Arundel, for the nominal sum of £41: 6: 8, with several other\r\nmessuages and lands adjoining.[66] The earl dying in 1579, was succeeded\r\nby his grandson, Philip Howard, son of the Duke of Norfolk, the owner of\r\nEssex House adjoining, who was beheaded for his intrigues with Mary of\r\nScotland. He died in the Tower in 1598. The house then passed into the\r\nkeeping of Robert Cary, Earl of Monmouth,[67] during the minority of\r\nThomas Howard, Philip’s son.\r\n\r\nIn Arundel Palace, in 1603, died the Countess of Nottingham, sister of Sir\r\nRobert Cary;[68] she was buried at Chelsea. It is of this countess that\r\nLady Spelman, a granddaughter of Sir Robert Cary, used to tell the\r\ndoubtful legend of the ring[69] given by Queen Elizabeth to Lord Essex,\r\nwhich an acute writer of the present day believes to be a pure fabrication\r\nof the times of James I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARUNDEL HOUSE, 1646.]\r\n\r\nThe story runs thus:--When the Countess Catherine was dying, she sent to\r\nthe Queen to tell her that she had a secret to reveal, without disclosing\r\nwhich she could not die in peace. The Queen came, and the countess then\r\ntold her that when Essex was in the Tower, under sentence of death, he one\r\nmorning threw a ring from his window to a boy passing underneath, hiring\r\nhim to carry it to his friend Lady Scrope, the countess’s sister, and beg\r\nof her to present it in his name to the queen, who had promised to protect\r\nhim whenever he sent her that keepsake, and who was then waiting for some\r\nsuch sign of his submission. The boy not clearly understanding the\r\nmessage, brought the ring to the countess, who showed it to her husband,\r\nand he insisted on her keeping it. The countess, having made this\r\ndisclosure, begged her majesty’s forgiveness; but the queen answered,\r\n“God may forgive you, but I never can!” and burst from the room in a\r\nparoxysm of rage and grief. From that time Elizabeth became perturbed in\r\nmind, refused to eat or sleep, and died a fortnight after the countess.\r\nNow this is absurd. The queen never repented the death of that wrongheaded\r\ntraitor, and really died of a long-standing disease which had well-defined\r\nsymptoms.[70]\r\n\r\nAt Arundel House lodged that grave, wise minister of Henry IV. of France,\r\nthe Duc de Sully, then only the Marquis de Rosny. He describes the house\r\nwith complacency as fine and commodious, and having a great number of\r\napartments on the same floor. It was really a mean and low building, but\r\ncommanding a fine prospect of the river and Westminster, so fine, indeed,\r\nthat Hollar took a view of London from the roof. The first night of his\r\narrival Sully slept at the French ambassador’s house in Butcher Row\r\nadjoining, a poor house with low rooms, a well staircase lit by a\r\nskylight, and small casements.[71]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARUNDEL HOUSE, 1646.]\r\n\r\nIn the time of James I., in whose reign the earldom was restored to Thomas\r\nHoward, Arundel House became a treasury of art. The travelled earl’s\r\ncollection comprised thirty-seven statues, one hundred and twenty-eight\r\nbusts, and two-hundred and fifty inscribed marbles, exclusive of\r\nsarcophagi, altars, medals, gems, and fragments. Some of his noblest\r\nrelics, however, he was not allowed to remove from Rome. Of this proud and\r\nprincely amateur of art Lord Clarendon speaks with too obvious prejudice.\r\nHe describes him as living in a world of his own, surrounded by strangers,\r\nand though illiterate, willing to be thought a scholar because he was a\r\ncollector of works of art. Yet the historian admits that he had an air of\r\ngravity and greatness in his face and bearing. He affected an ancient and\r\ngrave dress; but Clarendon asserts that this was all outside, and that his\r\nreal disposition was “one of levity,” as he was fond of childish and\r\ndespicable amusements. Vansomer’s portraits of the earl and countess\r\ncontain views of the statue and picture galleries.[72] This illustrious\r\nnobleman, whom the excellent Evelyn calls “my noble friend,” died in 1646.\r\nAt the Restoration his house and marbles were restored to his grandson,\r\nMr. Henry Howard; the antiquities were then lying scattered about Arundel\r\nGardens, and were neglected and corroding, blanching with rain, and green\r\nwith damp, much to the horror of Evelyn and other antiquaries, who\r\nregarded their fate with alarm and pity.\r\n\r\nThe old Earl of Arundel (whom Clarendon disliked) had been a collector of\r\nart in a magnificent and princely way. He despatched artist-agents to\r\nItaly, and even to Asia Minor, to buy pictures, drawings, statues, votive\r\nslabs, and gems. William Petty collected sculpture for him at Paros and\r\nDelos, but the collections were lost off Samos in a storm. He collected\r\nHolbein’s and Albert Dürer’s drawings, discovered the genius of Inigo\r\nJones, and brought Hollar from Prague. He left England just before the\r\ntroubles, having received many affronts from Charles’s ministers, who had\r\nneglected to restore his ancient titles, went to Padua, and there died.\r\nThe marbles Mr. Evelyn induced Mr. Howard, in 1667, to send to the\r\nUniversity of Oxford; the statues were also given to Oxford by a later\r\ndescendant; and the earl’s library (originally part of that of the King of\r\nHungary) Mr. Evelyn persuaded the Duke of Norfolk to bestow on the Royal\r\nSociety.[73]\r\n\r\nThe old earl was, I suspect, a proud, soured, and a rather arrogant,\r\nformal person. In a certain dispute about a rectory, he once said to King\r\nCharles I.: “Sir, this rectory was an appendant and a manour of mine until\r\nmy grandfather unfortunately lost both his life and seven lordships, for\r\nthe love he bore to your grandmother.”[74]\r\n\r\nAfter the Great Fire of London, Mr. Howard lent the Royal Society rooms in\r\nhis house. In 1678 the palace was taken down, and the present Arundel,\r\nSurrey, Howard, and Norfolk streets were erected in its stead. The few\r\nmarbles that remained were removed to Tart Hall, Westminster, and to\r\nCuper’s Gardens across the river.[75] Tart Hall was the residence of the\r\nCountess of Arundel: Cuper’s Gardens belonged to a gardener of the Earl of\r\nArundel. The Duke of Norfolk originally intended to build a more\r\nmagnificent house on the old site, and even obtained an act of Parliament\r\nfor the purpose; but fashion was already setting westward, and the design\r\nwas abandoned.[76]\r\n\r\nIn Arundel Street lived Rymer, the historical antiquary, who died here in\r\n1715; John Anstis, the Garter king-at-arms, resided here in 1715-16;[77]\r\nalso Mrs. Porter, the actress, “over against the Blue Ball.”\r\n\r\nGay, in his delightful _Trivia_ sketches the “long Strand,” and pauses to\r\nmourn over the glories of Arundel House. His walk is from “the Temple’s\r\nsilent walls,” and he stays to look down at the site of the earl’s\r\nmansion--\r\n\r\n  ----“That narrow street, which steep descends,\r\n  Whose building to the shining shore extends;\r\n  Here Arundel’s famed structure rear’d its frame--\r\n  The street alone retains an empty name;\r\n  Where Titian’s glowing paint the canvas warm’d,\r\n  And Raphael’s fair design with judgment charm’d,\r\n  Now hangs the bellman’s song, and pasted here\r\n  The coloured prints of Overton appear;\r\n  Where statues breathed, the work of Phidias’ hands,\r\n  A wooden pump or lonely watch-house stands;\r\n  There Essex’ stately pile adorned the shore;\r\n  There Cecil’s, Bedford’s, Villiers’--now no more.”\r\n\r\nIn the Strand, between Arundel and Norfolk Streets, in the year 1698,\r\nlived Sir Thomas Lyttelton, Speaker of the House of Commons, and father of\r\nPope’s friend, and the author of the _History of Henry the Second_, a\r\nponderous and pompous work.\r\n\r\nNext door to him lived the father of Bishop Burnet--a remarkable person,\r\nfor he was a poor but honest lawyer, born at Edinburgh in 1643. A\r\nbookseller of the same name--a collateral descendant of the bishop whom\r\nSwift hated so cordially--afterwards occupied the house.\r\n\r\nAt the south-west corner of Norfolk Street, near the river, in his wild\r\ndays lodged the Quaker Penn, son of Cromwell’s stout Bristol admiral. He\r\nhad been twice beaten and turned out of doors by his father for his\r\nfondness for Nonconformist society and prayer-meetings, and for refusing\r\nto stand uncovered in the presence of Charles II. or of the Duke of York,\r\nof whom later he became the suspected favourite. We do not generally\r\nassociate the grave and fanatic Penn with a gay and licentious court, nor\r\ndo we portray him to ourselves as slinking away from hawk-eyed bailiffs;\r\nand yet the venerated founder of repudiating Pennsylvania chose this house\r\nwhen he was sued for debts, as being convenient for slipping unobserved\r\ninto a boat. In the eastern entrance he had a peep-hole, through which he\r\ncould reconnoitre any suspicious visitor. On one occasion a dun, having\r\nsent in his name and waited an unconscionable time, knocked again. “Will\r\nnot thy master see me?” he said to the servant. The knave was at least\r\ncandid, for he replied: “Friend, he _has_ seen thee, and he does not like\r\nthee.”[78]\r\n\r\nIn Norfolk Street, in Penn’s old house, afterwards resided for thirty\r\nyears that truly good man, Dr. Richard Brocklesby, who in early life,\r\nduring the Seven Years’ War, had practised as an army surgeon. He was a\r\nfriend of Burke and Dr. Johnson. To the former he left, or rather gave, a\r\nthousand pounds, and to the latter he offered an annuity of a hundred\r\npounds a year, to enable him to travel for his health, and also apartments\r\nin his own house for the sake of medical advice, which Johnson\r\naffectionately and gratefully declined. The doctor was one of the most\r\ngenerous and amiable of men; he attended the poor for nothing, and had\r\nmany pensioners. He died the day after returning from a visit to Burke at\r\nBeaconsfield. He had been warned against the fatigue of this journey, but\r\nhad replied with true Christian philosophy, “My good friend, where’s the\r\ndifference whether I die at a friend’s house, at an inn, or in a\r\npost-chaise? I hope I am prepared for such an event, and perhaps it would\r\nbe as well to elude the anticipation of it.”\r\n\r\nDr. Brocklesby was ridiculed by Foote, but Foote attacked virtue quite as\r\noften as vice. He was the physician who had attended Lord Chatham when he\r\nwas struck down by illness in the House of Lords, a short time before his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIn January 1698 Peter the Great arrived from Holland, and went straight to\r\na house prepared for him in Norfolk Street, near the water side. On the\r\nfollowing day he was visited by King William and the principal nobility.\r\nIncommoded here by visitors, the Czar removed to Admiral Benbow’s house at\r\nDeptford, where he could live more retired. This Deptford house was Sayes\r\nPlace, afterwards the Victualling Office, and had once belonged to the\r\ncelebrated John Evelyn.\r\n\r\nThe “Honest Shippen” of Pope--William Shippen, M.P.--lived also in Norfolk\r\nStreet: a brave, honest man, in an age when nearly every politician had\r\nhis price. It was of him Sir Robert Walpole remarked “that he would not\r\nsay who was corrupted, but he would say who was not corruptible, and that\r\nwas Shippen.”\r\n\r\nMortimer, a rough, picturesque painter, who was called “the English\r\nSalvator Rosa,” and imitated that unsatisfactory artist in a coarse,\r\nsketchy kind of way, dwelt in this street.\r\n\r\nAt No. 21 lived Albany Wallis, a friend and executor of Garrick. In this\r\nstreet also Addison makes that delightful old country gentleman, Sir Roger\r\nde Coverley, put up before he goes to Soho Square.[79]\r\n\r\nAt No. 8, in 1795, lived Samuel Ireland, the father of the celebrated\r\nliterary impostor; and here were shown to George Chalmers, John Kemble,\r\nand other Shaksperian scholars, the forged plays which the public\r\nultimately scented out as ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 Mr. W. H. Ireland published a full confession of his forgeries,\r\nfully exonerating his father from all connivance in his foolish fraud,\r\nclaiming forgiveness for a boyish deception begun without evil intention\r\nand without any thought of danger. “I should never have gone so far,” he\r\nsays, “but that the world praised the papers too much, and thereby\r\nflattered my vanity.”[80] After the failure of “Vortigern,” the father,\r\nMr. S. Ireland, still credulous, had written a pamphlet, accusing Malone,\r\nhis son’s chief assailant, of mean malice and unbearable arrogance.\r\n\r\nThe true story of the forgery is this. W. H. Ireland, then only eighteen,\r\nwas articled to a solicitor in New Inn, where he practised Elizabethan\r\nhandwriting for the sake of deceiving credulous antiquaries. A forged deed\r\nexciting the admiration of his father, who was a collector of old tracts\r\nand a worshipper of Shakspere, led him to continue his deceptions, and to\r\npretend to have discovered a hoard of Shaksperian MSS. A fellow clerk, one\r\nTalbot, afterwards an actor, discovering the forgeries, Ireland made him\r\nan accomplice. They then produced a “Profession of Faith,” signed by\r\nShakspere, which Dr. Parr and Dr. Warton (brother of the poet) declared\r\ncontained “finer things” than all the Church Service. This foolish praise\r\nset the secretive lawyer’s clerk on writing original verse,--a poem to\r\nAnne Hathaway, and the play of “Vortigern,” the most recklessly impudent\r\nof all his impostures. Boswell was the first to propose a certificate to\r\nbe signed by all believers in the productions. Dr. Parr, thinking\r\nBoswell’s writing too feeble, drew up another, which was signed by\r\ntwenty-one noblemen, authors, and “celebrated literary characters.”\r\nBoswell, characteristically enough, previous to signing his name, fell on\r\nhis knees, and, “in a tone of enthusiasm and exultation, thanked God that\r\nhe had lived to witness this discovery, and exclaimed that he could now\r\ndie in peace.”[81] Lords Kinnaird, Somerset, and Lauderdale were the\r\nnoblemen. There were also present Bindley, Valpy, Pinkerton, Pye the poet\r\nlaureate, Matthew Wyatt, and the present author’s grandfather, the Rev.\r\nNathaniel Thornbury, an intimate friend of Jenner and of Dr. Johnson, who\r\nhad at this time been twelve years dead. The elder Ireland, in his\r\npamphlet, alludes to the solemn and awful manner in which, before crowds\r\nof eminent characters, his son attested the genuineness of his forgeries.\r\n“I could not,” says the honest fellow, “suffer myself to cherish the\r\nslightest suspicion of his veracity.”[82]\r\n\r\nSingularly enough Mr. Albany Wallis--(a solicitor, I believe), of Norfolk\r\nStreet,--who had given to Garrick a mortgage deed bearing Shakspere’s\r\nsignature, became the most ardent believer in the unprincipled young\r\nclerk’s deceptions.\r\n\r\nThe terms agreed upon for Ireland’s forgery of “Vortigern” was £300 down,\r\nand a division of the receipts, deducting charges, for sixty nights. The\r\nplay, however, lived only one night, for which the Irelands received their\r\nhalf, £103. The commentators Malone and Steevens remained sceptical, and\r\nKemble was suspicious and cold in the cause, though he was to be the hero;\r\nbut the gulls and quidnuncs were numerous enough to cram the house, and\r\nthat most commonplace of poets, Sir James Bland Burges, wrote the\r\nprologue. The final damnation of the play was secured by a rhapsody of\r\nVortigern’s, a patch-work thing from “Richard II.” and “Henry IV.” The\r\nfatal line--\r\n\r\n  “And when the solemn mockery is o’er,”\r\n\r\nconvulsed the house.[83] Mr. W. H. Ireland in later life was editor of the\r\n_York Herald_, and died in 1835.[84]\r\n\r\nAnother eminent historical antiquary, Dr. Birch, lived in Norfolk Street.\r\nThe son of a Quaker tradesman at Clerkenwell, he became a London clergyman\r\nand an historian, famous for his Sunday evenings’ conversaziones, and was\r\nkilled by a fall from his horse in 1766. He seems to have been a most\r\npleasant, generous, and honest man. He edited Bacon’s _Letters and\r\nSpeeches_, and Thurloe’s _State Papers_, etc. His chief work was his\r\n_Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth_. He left books, manuscripts, and\r\nmoney to the British Museum, for which let all scholars bless the good\r\nman’s memory. He appears to have been a student of boundless industry, as\r\nfrom the Lambeth Library alone he transcribed with his own hand sixteen\r\nquarto volumes. He was rector of St. Margaret Pattens in Fenchurch Street.\r\nDr. Birch must have been a kind husband, for his wife on her deathbed\r\nwrote him the following tender letter:--\r\n\r\n    “This day I return you, my dearest life, my sincere, hearty thanks for\r\n    every favour bestowed on your most faithful and obedient wife,\r\n\r\n      HANNAH BIRCH.”\r\n\r\nWe leave it to the watchful cynic to remark that the doctor had been\r\nmarried only one year. It was of this worthy book-worm that Johnson\r\nsaid--“Yes, sir, he is brisk in conversation, but when he takes up the pen\r\nit benumbs him like a torpedo.”\r\n\r\nStrype describes Surrey Street as replenished with good buildings,\r\nespecially that of Nevison Fox, Esq., towards the Strand, “which is a\r\nfine, large, and curious house of his own building,” and the two houses\r\nthat front the Thames, that on the east side being the Hon. Charles\r\nHoward’s, brother to the Duke of Norfolk. Both of these houses had\r\npleasant though small gardens towards the Thames.[85]\r\n\r\nIn 1736 died here George Sale, the useful translator of the Mohammedan\r\nBible, the Koran, that strange compound of pure prayers and impure\r\nplagiarisms from the laws of Moses. Sale had published his Koran in 1734,\r\nand in the year of his death he joined Paul Whitehead, Dr. Birch, and Mr.\r\nStrutt, in founding a “Society for the Encouragement of Learning.” He\r\nspent many years in writing for the _Universal History_, in which Bayle’s\r\nten folio volumes were included.\r\n\r\nEdward Pierce, a sculptor, son of a painter of altar-pieces and\r\nchurch-ceilings, and a pupil of Vandyke, lived at the corner of Surrey\r\nStreet, and was buried in the Savoy. He helped Sir Christopher Wren to\r\nbuild St. Clement’s church, and carved the four guardian dragons on the\r\nMonument of London. The statue of Sir William Walworth at the fishmongers’\r\nHall is from his hand, and so is the bust of Thomas Evans in the hall of\r\nthe painters and stainers. He executed also busts of Cromwell, Wren, and\r\nMilton.[86]\r\n\r\nThe charming actress, Mrs. Bracegirdle, lived in Howard Street. She was\r\nthe belle and toast of London; every young man of mode was, or pretended\r\nto be, in love with her; and the wits wrote verses upon her beauty, in\r\nimitation of Sedley and Waller. Congreve tells us that it was the fashion\r\nto avow a tenderness for her. Rowe, in an imitation of an ode of Horace,\r\nurges the Earl of Scarsdale to marry her (though he had a wife living) and\r\nset the town at defiance.\r\n\r\nAmong this crowd of admirers was a Captain Hill, a half-cracked\r\nman-about-town, a drunken, profligate bully, of low character, and a\r\nfriend of the infamous duellist, Lord Mohun. One of Mrs. Bracegirdle’s\r\nfavourite parts was Statira, her lover Alexander being her friend and\r\nneighbour, the eminent actor Mountfort. Cibber describes him in this\r\ncharacter as “great, tender, persistent, despairing, transported,\r\namiable.” Hill, “that dark-souled fellow in the pit,” as Leigh Hunt calls\r\nhim, mistook the frantic extravagance of stage-passion for real love, and\r\nin a fit of mad jealousy swore to be revenged on Mountfort, and to carry\r\noff the lady by force. Lord Mohun, always ready for any desperate\r\nmischief, agreed to help him in his design. On the night appointed the\r\nfriends dined together, and having changed clothes, went to Drury Lane\r\nTheatre at six o’clock; but as Mrs. Bracegirdle did not act that night,\r\nthey next took a coach and drove to her lodgings in Howard Street. They\r\nthen, finding that she had gone to supper with a Mr. Page, in Princes\r\nStreet, Drury Lane, went to his house and waited till she came out. She\r\nappeared at last at the door, with her mother and brother, Mr. Page\r\nlighting them out.\r\n\r\nHill immediately seized her, and endeavoured, with the aid of some hired\r\nruffians, to drag her into the coach, where Lord Mohun sat with a loaded\r\npistol in each hand; but her brother and Mr. Page rushing to the rescue,\r\nand an angry crowd gathering, Hill was forced to let go his hold and\r\ndecamp. Mrs. Bracegirdle and her escort then proceeded to her lodgings in\r\nHoward Street, followed by Captain Hill and Lord Mohun on foot. On\r\nknocking at the door, as it was said, to beg Mrs. Bracegirdle’s pardon,\r\nthey were refused admittance; upon which they sent for a bottle of wine to\r\na neighbouring tavern, which they drank in the street, and then began to\r\npatrol up and down with swords drawn, declaring they were waiting to be\r\nrevenged on Mountfort the actor. Messengers were instantly despatched to\r\nwarn Mountfort, both by Mrs. Bracegirdle’s landlady and his own wife, but\r\nhe could not be found. The watch were also sent for, and they begged the\r\ntwo ruffians to depart peaceably. Lord Mohun replied, “He was a peer of\r\nthe realm, that he had been drinking a bottle of wine, but that he was\r\nready to put up his sword if they particularly desired it: but as for his\r\nfriend, he had lost his scabbard.” The cautious watch then went away.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the unlucky Mountfort, suspecting no evil, passed down the\r\nstreet on his way home, heedless of warnings. On coming up to the\r\nswordsmen, a female servant heard the following conversation:--\r\n\r\nLord Mohun embraced Mountfort, and said--\r\n\r\n“Mr. Mountfort, your humble servant. I am glad to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Who is this?--Lord Mohun?” said Mountfort.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is.”\r\n\r\n“What brings your lordship here at this time of night?”\r\n\r\nLord Mohun replied--\r\n\r\n“I suppose you were sent for, Mr. Mountfort?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, I came by chance.”\r\n\r\n“Have you not heard of the business of Mrs. Bracegirdle?”\r\n\r\n“Pray, my lord,” said Hill, breaking in, “hold your tongue. This is not a\r\nconvenient time to discuss this business.”\r\n\r\nHill seemed desirous to go away, and pulled Lord Mohun’s sleeve; but\r\nMountfort, taking no notice of Hill, continued to address Lord Mohun,\r\nsaying he was sorry to see him assisting Captain Hill in such an evil\r\naction, and begging him to forbear.\r\n\r\nHill instantly gave the actor a box on the ear, and on Mountfort demanding\r\nwhat that was for, attacked him sword in hand, and ran him through before\r\nhe had time to draw his weapon. Mountfort died the next day of the wound,\r\ndeclaring with his last breath that Lord Mohun had offered him no\r\nviolence. Hill fled from justice, and Lord Mohun was tried for murder, but\r\nunfortunately acquitted for want of evidence.\r\n\r\nThat fortunate poet, Congreve, whom Pope declared to be one of the three\r\nmost honest-hearted and really good men in the Kit-cat Club, lived for\r\nsome time in Howard Street, where he was a neighbour and frequent guest of\r\nMrs. Bracegirdle.\r\n\r\nCongreve, on becoming acquainted with the Duchess of Marlborough, removed\r\nfrom Howard Street to a better house in Surrey Street, where he died,\r\nJanuary 19, 1729. The career of this son of a Yorkshire officer had been\r\none long undisturbed triumph. His first play had been revised by Dryden\r\nand praised by Southerne. Besides being commissioner of hackney-coach and\r\nwine licences, he also held a place in the Pipe Office, a post in the\r\nCustom House, and a secretaryship in Jamaica. He never quarrelled with the\r\nwits: both Addison and Steele admired and praised him, and Voltaire\r\neulogises his comedies.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Voltaire, while lodging in Maiden Lane, visited the gouty\r\nand nearly blind dramatist, then infirm and on the verge of life. “Mr.\r\nCongreve,” he says, “had one defect, which was his entertaining too mean\r\nan idea of his profession--that of a writer--though it was to this he owed\r\nhis fame and fortune. He spoke of his works as of trifles that were\r\nbeneath him, and hinted to me in our first conversation that I should\r\nvisit him upon no other footing than that of a gentleman who led a life of\r\nplainness and simplicity. I answered, that _had he been so unfortunate as\r\nto be a mere gentleman_ I should never have come to see him; and I was\r\nvery much disgusted at so unseasonable a piece of vanity.”\r\n\r\nThe body of Congreve lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and was\r\nafterwards interred with great solemnity in Henry VII.’s Chapel. The Duke\r\nof Bridgewater and the Earl of Godolphin were amongst those who bore the\r\npall. The monument was erected by the Duchess of Marlborough, to whom the\r\nfavoured poet had left £10,000. Above his body--\r\n\r\n  “The ancient pillars rear their marble heads\r\n  To bear aloft the arch’d and pond’rous roof,\r\n  By its own weight made steadfast and immoveable.”[87]\r\n\r\nCongreve’s bequest to the duchess of all his property, except £1000,\r\nincluding £200 to Mrs. Bracegirdle (a legacy afterwards cancelled),\r\ncreated much scandal. The shameless bookseller, Curll, instantly launched\r\nforth a life of Congreve, professing to be written by one Charles Wilson,\r\nEsq., but generally attributed to Oldmixon. The duchess’s friends were\r\nalarmed, and Arbuthnot interfered. Upon being told that some genuine\r\nletters and essays were to be published in the work, Mrs. Bracegirdle or\r\nthe duchess[88] cried out with defiant affectation and a dramatic drawl,\r\n“Not one single sheet of paper, I dare to swear.”\r\n\r\nThe duchess, who raised a monument in the Abbey to her brilliant but\r\nartificial friend, is said to have had a wax image of him made to place on\r\nher toilette table. “To this she would talk as to the living Mr. Congreve,\r\nwith all the freedom of the most _polite_ and unreserved\r\nconversation.”[89]\r\n\r\nStrand Lane used formerly to lead to a small landing-pier for wherries,\r\ncalled Strand Bridge. In Stow’s time the lane passed under a bridge down\r\nto the landing-place.[90] A writer in the _Spectator_ describes how he\r\nlanded here on a summer morning, arriving with ten sail of apricot boats,\r\nconsigned to Covent Garden,[91] after having first touched at Nine Elms\r\nfor melons. In this lane there is a fine Roman bath which, if indeed\r\nRoman, is the most western relic of Roman London, the centre of which was\r\non the east end of the Royal Exchange.\r\n\r\nNo. 165 has been long used as a warehouse for the sale of Dr. Anderson’s\r\npills. Dr. Patrick Anderson was physician to Charles I., and as early as\r\n1649 a man named Inglis sold these quack pills at the Golden Unicorn, over\r\nagainst the Maypole in the Strand. Tom Brown says, “There are at least a\r\nscore of pretenders to Anderson’s Scotch pills, and the Lord knows who has\r\nthe true preparation.” Brown died in 1704. Sir Walter Scott used to tell\r\none of his best stories about these pills. It dwelt on the passion for\r\nthem entertained by a certain hypochondriacal Lowland laird. Bland or\r\nrough, old or young, no visitor at his house escaped a dose--“joost ane\r\nleetle Anderson;” and his toady “the doer” used always to swallow a\r\nbrace.[92]\r\n\r\nThe Turk’s Head Coffee-house stood on the site of No. 142 Strand. Dr.\r\nJohnson used to sup at this house to encourage the hostess, who was a\r\ngood civil woman, and had not too much business. July 28, 1763, Boswell\r\nmentions supping there with Dr. Johnson; and again, on August 3, in the\r\nsame year, just before he set out for his wildgoose chase in Corsica.[93]\r\nNo. 132 was the shop of a bookseller named Bathoe. The first circulating\r\nlibrary in London was established here in 1740.\r\n\r\nJacob Tonson, Dryden’s grinding publisher and bookseller, lived at the\r\nShakspere’s Head, over against Catherine Street, now No. 141 Strand, from\r\nabout 1712 till he died, in 1735-6. Tonson seems to have been rough, hard,\r\nand penurious. The poet and publisher were perpetually squabbling, and\r\nDryden was especially vexed at his trying to force him to dedicate his\r\ntranslation of Virgil to King William, and when he refused, making the\r\nengraver of the frontispiece aggravate the nose of Æneas till it became “a\r\nhooked promontory,” like that of the Protestant king. It was to Tonson’s\r\nshop at Gray’s Inn, however, that Dryden, on being refused money, probably\r\nsent that terrible triplet to the obdurate bibliopole:--\r\n\r\n  “With leering looks, bull-faced, and freckled fair,\r\n  With two left legs, and Judas-colour’d hair,\r\n  And frowsy pores that taint the ambient air.”[94]\r\n\r\n“Tell the dog,” said Dryden to his messenger, “that he who wrote those can\r\nwrite more.” But Tonson was perfectly satisfied with this first shot, and\r\nsurrendered at discretion. The irascible poet afterwards accused him of\r\nintercepting his letters to his sons at Rome, and he confessed to\r\nBolingbroke on one occasion that he was afraid of Tonson’s tongue.[95]\r\n\r\nTonson’s house, since rebuilt, was afterwards occupied by Andrew Millar,\r\nthe publisher and friend of Thomson, Fielding, Hume, and Robertson, and\r\nafter his death by Thomas Cadell, his apprentice, and the friend and\r\npublisher of Gibbon the historian. The _Seasons_, _Tom Jones_, and the\r\nHistories of Hume, Robertson, and Gibbon were first published at this\r\nhouse. Millar was a Scotchman, and distinguished his shop by the sign of\r\nBuchanan’s Head, afterwards the badge of Messrs. Blackwood.\r\n\r\nThe _Illustrated London News_, whose office is near Somerset House, was\r\nstarted in 1842 by Mr. Herbert Ingram, originally a humble newsvendor at\r\nNorthampton; an industrious man, who would run five miles with a newspaper\r\nto oblige an old customer. In the first year he sold a million copies; in\r\nthe second, two; and in 1848, three millions. Dr. Mackay, the song-writer,\r\nwrote leaders; Mr. Mark Lemon aided him; Mr. Peter Cunningham collected\r\nhis column of weekly chat; Thomas Miller, the basket-maker poet, was also\r\non his staff. Mr. Ingram obtained a seat in Parliament, and was eventually\r\ndrowned in a steamboat collision on Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENN’S HOUSE, NORFOLK STREET, 1749.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOMERSET HOUSE FROM THE RIVER, 1746.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSOMERSET HOUSE.\r\n\r\n  “And every day there passes by my side,\r\n  Up to its western reach, the London tide--\r\n  The spring tides of the term. My front looks down\r\n  On all the pride and business of the town;\r\n  My other fair and more majestic face\r\n  For ever gazes on itself below,\r\n  In the best mirror that the world can show.”\r\n                                          COWLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat ambitious and rapacious noble the Protector Somerset, brother of\r\nQueen Jane Seymour, and maternal uncle of Edward VI., the owner of more\r\nthan two hundred manors,[96] and who boasted that his own friends and\r\nretainers made up an army of ten thousand men, determined to build a\r\npalace in the Strand. For this purpose he demolished the parish church of\r\nSt. Mary, and pulled down the houses of the Bishops of Worcester,\r\nLlandaff, and Lichfield. He also began to remove St. Margaret’s, at\r\nWestminster, for building materials, till his masons were driven away by\r\nrioters. He destroyed a chapel in St. Paul’s Churchyard, with a cloister\r\ncontaining the “Dance of Death,” and a charnel-house, the bones of which\r\nhe buried in unconsecrated ground,[97] and finally stole the stones of the\r\nchurch of St. John of Jerusalem, near Smithfield,[98] and those of Strand\r\nInn (belonging to the Temple), where Occleve the poet, a contemporary of\r\nGower and Chaucer, had studied law.\r\n\r\nThe unwise Protector determined in this building to rival Whitehall and\r\nHampton Court. It was begun probably about 1549, and no doubt remained\r\nunfinished at his death. He had at that time lavished on it £50,000 of our\r\npresent money.\r\n\r\nThe architect was John of Padua,[99] Henry VIII.’s architect, who built\r\nLongleat, in Wiltshire, the seat of the Marquis of Bath, a magnificent\r\nspecimen of the Italian-Elizabethan style, and also the gates of Caius\r\nCollege, at Cambridge. The Protector is said to have spent at one time\r\n£100 a day in building, every stone he laid bringing him nearer to his own\r\nnarrow home. A plan of the house is still preserved in the Soane\r\nMuseum.[100]\r\n\r\nAfter the attainder of the duke, when the new palace became the property\r\nof the crown, little was done to complete the building. The screen\r\nprepared for the hall was bought for St. Bride’s, where it was probably\r\ndestroyed in the Great Fire.[101] The Protector was a good friend to the\r\npeople, but he was weak and ambitious, and the plotters of Ely House had\r\nno difficulty in dragging him to the scaffold. The minority of Edward\r\nbrought many of the Strand noblemen to the axe, but the fate of the\r\nadmiral and his brother did not deter their neighbours Northumberland,\r\nRaleigh, Norfolk, and Essex.\r\n\r\nElizabeth granted the keeping of Somerset House to her faithful cousin\r\nLord Hunsdon, for life,[102] and here she frequently would visit him, in a\r\njewelled farthingale, with Raleigh and Essex in her train.\r\n\r\nIn 1616 that Scotch Solomon, James I., commanded the place to be called\r\nDenmark House; and his queen kept her gay and not very decent court here,\r\nso that Ben Jonson must have often seen his glorious masques acted in this\r\npalace, to which his coadjutor Inigo Jones built a chapel, and made other\r\nadditions. Anne of Denmark and her maids-of-honour kept up here a\r\ncontinual masquerade,[103] appearing in various dresses, and transforming\r\nthemselves to the delight of all whose interest it was to be delighted.\r\n\r\nHere too that impetuous queen, Henrietta Maria, resided with her wilful\r\nand extravagant French household, whose insolence irritated and disgusted\r\nthe people and offended Charles the First. The king at last, losing\r\npatience, summoned them together one evening and dismissed them all. They\r\nbehaved like sutlers at the sack of a town. They claimed fictitious debts;\r\nthey invented exorbitant bills; they greedily divided among each other the\r\nqueen’s wardrobe and jewels, scarcely leaving her a change of linen. The\r\nking paid nearly £50,000 to get rid of them; Madame St. George alone\r\nclaiming several thousand pounds besides jewels.[104] They still delayed\r\ntheir departure; on which the king, at last roused, wrote the following\r\nimperative letter to Buckingham:--\r\n\r\n    “STEENIE--I have received your letter by Dick Greame. This is my\r\n    answer. I command you to send all the French away to-morrow out of the\r\n    town, if you can by fair means (but stick not long in disputing),\r\n    otherways force them away--driving them away like so many wild beasts\r\n    until ye have shipped them; and the devil go with them. Let me hear no\r\n    answer, but of the performance of my command. So I rest\r\n\r\n      “Your faithful, constant, loving friend,\r\n        “C. R.\r\n\r\n    “Oaking, the seventh of August, 1626.”\r\n\r\nAs the French invented all sorts of vexatious delays, the yeomen of the\r\nguard at last jostled them out, carting them off in nearly forty coaches.\r\nThey arrived at Dover after four days’ tedious travelling, wrangling, and\r\nbewailing. The squib did not burn out without one final detonation. As the\r\nvivacious Madame St. George stepped into the boat, with perhaps some\r\ninsolent gesture of adieu, a man in the mob flung a stone at her French\r\ncap. A gallant Englishman who was escorting her instantly quitted his\r\ncharge, ran the fellow through the body, and returned to the boat. The man\r\ndied on the spot, but no notice, it appears, was taken of the murderer.\r\n\r\nIn Somerset House, at the Christmas masque of 1632-3, Charles’s\r\nhigh-spirited queen took part for the last time in a masque. Unfortunately\r\nfor Prynne, the next day out came his _Histriomastix_, with a scurrilous\r\nmarginal note, “Women actors notorious whores!” for which the stubborn\r\nfanatic lost his ears.\r\n\r\nQueen Henrietta had, in Somerset House, an ostentatiously magnificent\r\nCatholic chapel built by Inigo Jones, which became the scene of spectacles\r\nthat were gall and wormwood to the Puritans, who were already couching for\r\ntheir spring.\r\n\r\nTheir time came in March 1643, when Roundheads, grimly rejoicing, burnt\r\nall the pictures, images, Jesuitical books, and tapestry.[105]\r\n\r\nFive of the unhappy queen’s French Roman Catholic servants are entombed in\r\nthe cellars of the present building, under the great quiet square.[106]\r\n\r\nHere, close to his own handiwork, that distinguished architect, Inigo\r\nJones, who had lodgings in the palace, died in 1652.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the House of Peers permitted the Protestant service to\r\nbe held in Somerset House instead of in Durham House. This drove out the\r\nQuakers and Anabaptists, and prevented the pulling down of the palace and\r\nthe making of a street from the garden through the chapel and back-yard up\r\ninto the Strand.[107]\r\n\r\nThe Protector’s palace was the scene of a great and sad event in November\r\n1658; for the body of Cromwell, who had died at Whitehall, lay in state\r\nhere for several days. He lay in effigy on a bed of royal crimson velvet,\r\ncovered with a velvet gown, a sceptre in his hand, and a crown upon his\r\nhead. The Cavaliers, whose spirits were recovering, were very angry at\r\nthis foolish display,[108] forgetting that it was not poor Oliver’s own\r\ndoing; and the baser people, who follow any impulse of the day, threw dirt\r\nin the night upon the blazoned escutcheon that was displayed over the\r\ngreat gate of Somerset House.\r\n\r\nThe year after, an Act was passed to sell all royal property, and Somerset\r\nHouse was disposed of for £10,000. The Restoration soon stepped in and\r\nannulled the bargain. After the return of the son who so completely\r\nrevenged upon us the death of his father, the luckless palace became the\r\nresidence of its former inhabitant, now older and gentler--the\r\nqueen-mother. She improved and beautified it. The old courtier, Waller,\r\nonly fifty-seven at the time, wrote some fulsome verses on the occasion.\r\nHe talks of her adorning the town as with a brave revenge, to show--\r\n\r\n  “That glory came and went with you.”\r\n\r\nHe mentions also the view from the palace:--\r\n\r\n  “The fair view her window yields,\r\n  The town, the river, and the fields.”\r\n\r\nCowley, the son of a Fleet Street grocer, flew still higher, larded his\r\nflattery with perverted texts, like a Puritanised Cavalier time-server,\r\nand wrote--\r\n\r\n  “On either side dwells Safety and Delight;\r\n  Wealth on the left and Power sits on the right.”\r\n\r\nIn May 1665, when the queen-mother, who had lived in Somerset House with\r\nher supposed husband, the Earl of St. Albans, took her farewell of England\r\nfor a gayer court, Cowley wrote these verses to the setting sun, in hopes\r\nto propitiate the rising sun; for here, too, lived Catherine of Braganza,\r\nthe unhappy wife of Charles II.\r\n\r\nThere were strange scenes at Somerset House even during the queen-mother’s\r\nresidence, for the old court gossip Pepys describes being taken one day to\r\nthe Presence-chamber.[109] He found the queen not very charming, but still\r\nmodest and engaging. Lady Castlemaine was there, Mr. Crofts, a pretty\r\nyoung spark of fifteen (her illegitimate child), and many great ladies. By\r\nand by in came the king and the Duke and Duchess of York. The conversation\r\nwas not a very decorous one; and the young queen said to Charles, “You\r\nlie!” which made good sport, as the chuckling and delighted Pepys remarks,\r\nthose being the first English words he had heard her say; and the king\r\nthen tried to make her reply, “Confess and be hanged.”\r\n\r\nIn another place Pepys indignantly describes “a little proud, ugly,\r\ntalkative lady crying up the queen-mother’s court as more decorous than\r\nthe king’s;” yet the diary-keeper confesses that the former was the better\r\nattended, the old nobility dreading, I suppose, the scandal of\r\nWhitehall.[110]\r\n\r\nIn 1670 Monk, Duke of Albemarle, having died at his lodgings in the\r\nCockpit, at Whitehall, lay in state in Somerset House, and was afterwards\r\nburied with almost regal pomp in Henry VII.’s Chapel.\r\n\r\nIn October 1678, the infamous devisers of the Popish plot connected\r\nSomerset House and the attendants in the Queen’s Chapel with the murder of\r\na City magistrate, the supposed Protestant martyr, Sir Edmondbury Godfrey,\r\nwho was found murdered in a field near Primrose Hill, “between Kilburn and\r\nHampstead,” as it was then thought necessary to specify. The lying\r\nwitnesses, Prance and Bedloe, swore that the justice had been inveigled\r\ninto Somerset House under pretence of being wanted to keep the peace\r\nbetween two servants who were fighting in the yard; that he was then\r\nstrangled, his neck broken, and his own sword run through his body. The\r\ncorpse was kept four days, then carried in a sedan-chair to Soho, and\r\nafterwards on a horse to Primrose Hill, nearly three miles off. The\r\nsecrecy and convenient neighbourhood of the river for hiding a murdered\r\nman seem never to have struck the rogues, who forgot even to “lie like\r\ntruth,” so credulous and excited was the multitude.\r\n\r\nWaller, says Aubrey, though usually very temperate, was once made drunk at\r\nSomerset House by some courtiers, and had a cruel fall when taking boat at\r\nthe water stairs, “’Twas a pity to use such a sweet man so\r\ninhumanly.”[111] Saville used to say that “nobody should keep him company\r\nwithout drinking but Mr. Waller.”\r\n\r\nIn 1692 that poor ill-used woman and unhappy wife, Catherine of Braganza,\r\nleft Somerset House, and returned thence to Portugal, the home of her\r\nhappy childhood and happier youth.\r\n\r\nThe palace, never the home of very happy inmates, then became a lodging\r\nfor foreign kings and ambassadors, and a home for a few noblemen and poor\r\nretainers of the court, much as Hampton Court is now. Lewis de Duras, Earl\r\nof Feversham, the incompetent commander at Sedgemoor, who lies buried at\r\nthe Savoy, lived here in 1708; and so did Lady Arlington, the widow of\r\nSecretary Bennet, that butt of Killigrew and Rochester. In the reign of\r\nGeorge III., Charlotte Lennox, the authoress of the _Female Quixote_, had\r\napartments in Somerset House.\r\n\r\nHouses, like men, run their allotted courses. In 1775 the old palace,\r\nwhich had been settled on the queen-consort in the event of her surviving\r\nthe king, was exchanged for Buckingham House; and the Government instantly\r\nbegan to pull down the river-side palace, and erect new public offices\r\ndesigned by Sir William Chambers, a Scotch architect, who had given\r\ninstruction in his art to George III., when Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nIn 1630, a row of fishmongers’ stalls, in the middle of the street, over\r\nagainst Denmark House (Somerset House), was broken down by order of\r\nGovernment to prevent stalls from growing into sheds, and sheds into\r\ndwelling houses, as had been the case in Old Fish Street, Saint Nicholas\r\nShambles, and other places.[112]\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of February, 1659-60, Pepys tells us in his diary, that having\r\n£60 with him of his lord’s money, on his way from London Bridge, and\r\nhearing the noise of guns, he landed at Somerset House, and found the\r\nStrand full of soldiers. Going upstairs to a window, Pepys looked out and\r\nsaw the foot face the horse and beat them back, all the while bawling for\r\na free parliament and money. By and by a drum was heard to sound a march\r\ntowards them, and they all got ready again, but the new comers proving of\r\nthe same mind, they “made a great deal of joy to see one another.”[113]\r\nThis was the beginning of Monk’s change, for the king returned in the\r\nfollowing May. On the 18th of February two soldiers were hanged opposite\r\nSomerset House for a mutiny, of which Pepys was an eye-witness.\r\n\r\nThe prints of old Somerset House show a long line of battlemented wall\r\nfacing the river, and a turreted and partially arcaded front. There is\r\nalso a scarce view of the place by Hollar.[114] The river front has two\r\nporticos. The chapel is to the left, and near it are the cloisters of the\r\nCapuchins. The bowling-green seems to be to the right, between the two\r\nrows of trees. The garden is formal. The royal apartments were on the\r\nriver side. The only memorial left of the outhouses of the old palace was\r\nthe sign of a lion in the wall of a house in the Strand, that is mentioned\r\nin old records.[115]\r\n\r\nDryden describes his two friends, Eugenius and Neander, landing at\r\nSomerset Stairs, and gives us a pleasant picture of the summer evening,\r\nthe water on which the moonbeams played looked like floating quicksilver,\r\nand some French people dancing merrily in the open air as the friends walk\r\nonwards to the Piazza.[116]\r\n\r\nOf the old views of Somerset House, that of Moss is considered the best.\r\nThere is also an early and curious one by Knyff. A picture in Dulwich\r\nGallery (engraved by Wilkinson) represents the river front before Inigo\r\nJones had added a chapel for the queen of Charles I.[117]\r\n\r\nSir William Chambers built the present Somerset House. The old palace,\r\nwhen the clearance for the demolition began, presented a singular\r\nspectacle.[118] At the extremity of the royal apartments two large\r\nfolding-doors joined Inigo Jones’s additions to John of Padua’s work. They\r\nopened into a long gallery on the first floor of the water garden wing, at\r\nthe lower end of which was another gallery, making an angle which formed\r\nthe original river front, and extended to Strand Lane. This old part had\r\nbeen long shut up, and was supposed to be haunted. The gallery was\r\npanelled and floored with oak. The chandelier chains still hung from the\r\nstucco ceilings. The furniture of the royal apartment was removed into\r\nlumber-rooms by the Royal Academy. There were relics of a throne and\r\ncanopy; the crimson velvet curtains for the audience-chamber had faded to\r\nolive colour; and the fringe and lace were there, but a few threads and\r\nspangles had been peeled off them. There were also scattered about in\r\ndisorder, broken chairs, stools, couches, screens, and fire-dogs.\r\n\r\nIn the older apartments much of Edward VI.’s furniture still remained. The\r\nsilk hangings of the audience-chamber were in tatters, and so were the\r\ncurtains, gilt-leather covers, and painted screens; one gilt chandelier\r\nalso remained, and so did the sconces. A door beyond, with difficulty\r\nopened, led into a small tower on the first floor, built by Inigo Jones,\r\nand used as a breakfast-room or dressing-room by Queen Catherine. It was a\r\nbeautiful octagonal domed apartment, with a tasteful cornice. The walls\r\nwere frescoed, and there were pictures on the ceiling. A door from this\r\nplace opened on the staircase and led to a bath-room, lined with marble,\r\non the ground floor.\r\n\r\nThe painters of the day compared the ruined palace, characteristically\r\nenough, to the gloomy precincts of the dilapidated castles in Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe’s wax-work romances.\r\n\r\nSir William Chambers completed his work in about five years, clearing two\r\nthousand a year. It cost more than half a million of money. The Strand\r\nfront is 135 feet long; the quadrangle 210 feet wide and 296 feet deep.\r\nThe main buildings are 54 feet deep and six stories high. They are faced\r\nwith Portland stone, now partly sooty black, partly blanched white with\r\nthe weather. The basement is adorned with rustic work, Corinthian\r\npilasters, balustrades, statues, masks, and medallions. The river terrace\r\nwas intended in anticipation of the possible embankment of the Thames.\r\nSome critics think Chambers’s great work heavy, others elegant but timid.\r\nThere is too much rustic work, and the whole is rather “cut up.” The vases\r\nand niches are unmeaning, and it was a great structural fault to make the\r\nportico columns of the fine river side stand on a brittle-looking arch.\r\n\r\nIt was to Somerset House that the Royal Academy came after the split in\r\nthe St. Martin’s Lane Society. Here West exhibited his respectable\r\nplatitudes, Reynolds his grand portraits, and Lawrence his graceful,\r\nbrilliant, but meretricious pictures. In the great room of the Academy, at\r\nthe top of the building, Reynolds, Opie, Barrie, and Fuseli lectured.\r\nThrough the doorway to the right of the vestibule, Reynolds, Wilkie,\r\nTurner, Flaxman, and Chantrey have often stepped. Under that bust of\r\nMichael Angelo almost all our great men from Johnson to Scott must have\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nCarlini, an Italian friend of Cipriani, executed the two central statues\r\non the Strand front of Somerset House, and also three of the nine colossal\r\nkey-stone masks--the rivers Dee, Tyne, and Severn. Carlini was one of the\r\nunsuccessful candidates for the Beckford monument in Guildhall. When\r\nCarlini was keeper of the Academy, he used to walk from his house in Soho\r\nto Somerset Place, dressed in a deplorable greatcoat, and with a broken\r\ntobacco pipe in his mouth; but when he went to the great annual Academy\r\ndinner, he would make his way into a chair, full dressed in a purple silk\r\ncoat, and scarlet gold-laced waistcoat, with point-lace ruffles, and a\r\nsword and bag.[119] Wilton, the sculptor, executed the two outer figures.\r\n\r\nGiuseppe Ceracchi, who carved some of the heads of the river gods for the\r\nkey-stones of the windows of the Strand front of Somerset House, was an\r\nItalian, but it is uncertain whether he was born at Rome or in Corsica. He\r\ngave the accomplished Mrs. Damer (General Conway’s daughter) her first\r\nlessons in sculpture, an art which she afterwards perfected in the studio\r\nof the elder Bacon. Ceracchi executed the only bust in marble that\r\nReynolds ever sat for. A statue of Mrs. Damer, from a model by him, is now\r\nin the British Museum. This sculptor was guillotined in 1801, for a plot\r\nagainst Napoleon.[120] He is said to have lost his wits in prison, and to\r\nhave mounted the scaffold dressed as a Roman emperor. It was to Mrs. Damer\r\n(the daughter of his old friend) that Horace Walpole, our most French of\r\nmemoir-writers, bequeathed his fantastic villa at Strawberry Hill, and its\r\nincongruous but valuable curiosities. She is said to have sent a bust of\r\nNelson to the Rajah of Tanjore, who wished to spread a taste for English\r\nart in India.\r\n\r\nThe rooms round the quadrangle are hives of red-tapists. There are about\r\nnine hundred Government clerks nestled away in them, and maintained at an\r\nannual cost to us of about £275,000. There is the office of the Duchy of\r\nCornwall, and there are the Legacy Duty, the Stamps, Taxes, and Excise\r\nOffices, the Inland Revenue Office, the Registrar General’s Office\r\n(created pursuant to 6 and 7 Will. IV., c. 86), part of the Admiralty and\r\nthe Audit Office, and lastly the Will Office.\r\n\r\nThe east wing of Somerset House, used as King’s College, was built in\r\n1829. The bronze statue of George III., and the fine recumbent figure of\r\nFather Thames, in the chief court, were cast by John Bacon, R.A.\r\n\r\nThe office for auditing the public accounts existed, under the name of the\r\nOffice of the Auditors of the Imprests, as far back as the time of Henry\r\nVIII. The present commission was established in 1785, and the salaries\r\nformerly paid for the passing of accounts are now paid out of the Civil\r\nList, all fees being abolished. The average annual cost of the office for\r\nauditing some three hundred and fifty accounts is £50,000. There are six\r\ncommissioners, a secretary, and upwards of a hundred clerks. Almost all\r\nthe home and colonial expenditure is examined at this office. Edward\r\nHarley and Arthur Maynwaring (the wit of the Kit-Cat Club) were the two\r\nAuditors of the Imprests in the reign of Queen Anne. The Earl of Oxford,\r\nthe collector of MSS., obtained many curious public documents from his\r\nbrother. If he had taken the whole the nation would have been a gainer;\r\nfor the Government bought his collection for the British Museum, and all\r\nthat he left (except what Sir William Musgrave, a commissioner, scraped\r\ntogether and gave to the British Museum) were barbarously destroyed by\r\nGovernment, heedless of their historical value. Maynwaring’s fees were\r\nabout £2000 a year. The present salary of a commissioner is £1200; the\r\nchairman’s salary is £500. In 1867 the western front of Somerset House was\r\nadded; it is from the designs of Pennethorne, to accommodate the clerks of\r\nthe Inland Revenue Department.\r\n\r\nThe Astronomical Society, Geographical Society, and Geological Society,\r\nwere for many years sheltered in Somerset House, before removing\r\nwestwards.\r\n\r\nHither, in 1782, from Crane Court, came the Royal Society. The entrance\r\ndoor to the society’s rooms, to the left of the vestibule, is marked out\r\nby the bust of Sir Isaac Newton; Herschel, Davy, and Wollaston, as well as\r\nWalpole and Hallam, must have passed here, for the same door leads to the\r\napartments of the Society of Antiquaries.\r\n\r\nThis society, when burnt out of Aldersgate Street by the Great Fire, held\r\nits meetings for a time in Arundel House. At first its doings were\r\ntrifling and sometimes absurd. Enthusiasts and pedants often made the\r\nsociety ludicrous by their aberrations. Charles II. pretended to admire\r\ntheir Baconic inductions, but must have laughed at Boyle’s essays and\r\nplatitudes, and the hope of Wilkins, the Bishop of Chester, of flying to\r\nthe moon. Evelyn’s suggestions were unpractical and dilettantish, and\r\nPepys’s ramblings not over wise. We may be sure that there was food for\r\nlaughter, when Butler could thus sketch the occupations of these\r\nphilosophers:--\r\n\r\n  “To measure wind and weigh the air,\r\n  To turn a circle to a square,\r\n  And in the braying of an ass\r\n  Find out the treble and the bass,\r\n  If mares neigh _alto_, and a cow\r\n  In double diapason low.”\r\n\r\nYet how can we wonder that in the vast gold mines of the new philosophy\r\nour wise men hesitated where first to sink their shafts? Cowley\r\nchivalrously sprang forward to ward off from them the laughter and scorn\r\nof the Rochesters and the Killigrews of the day, and to prove that these\r\ninitiative studies were not “impertinent and vain and small,” nothing in\r\nnature being worthless. He ends his fine, rambling ode with the following\r\nnoble simile:--\r\n\r\n  “Lo! when by various turns of the celestial dance,\r\n      In many thousand years,\r\n      A star so long unknown appears,\r\n  Though Heaven itself more beauteous by it grow,\r\n  It troubles and alarms the world below;\r\n  Does to the wise a star, to fools a meteor show.”[121]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society’s traditions belong more to Gresham College than to\r\nSomerset House, the later home of our wise men. It originated in 1645, in\r\nmeetings held in Wood Street and Gresham College, suggested by Theodore\r\nHank, a German of the Palatinate. During the Civil War its discussions\r\nwere continued at Oxford. The present entrance-money is £10, and the\r\nannual subscription is £4. The society consists at present of between 700\r\nand 800 fellows, and the anniversary is held every 30th of November, being\r\nSt. Andrew’s Day. The Transactions of the society fill upwards of 150\r\nquarto volumes. The first president was Viscount Brouncker, and the\r\nsecond Sir Joseph Williamson. Mr. William Spottiswoode is the present\r\npresident. The society possesses some valuable pictures, including three\r\nportraits of Sir Isaac Newton--one by C. Jervas, presented by the great\r\nphilosopher himself, and hung over the president’s chair; a second by D.\r\nC. Marchand, and a third by Vanderbank; two portraits of Halley, by Thomas\r\nMurray and Dahl; two of Hobbes, the great advocate of despotism--one taken\r\nin 1663 (three years after the Restoration), and the other by Gaspars,\r\npresented by Aubrey; Sir Christopher Wren, by Kneller; Wallis, by West;\r\nFlamstead, by Gibson; Robert Boyle, by F. Kerseboom (a good likeness, says\r\nBoyle); Pepys, the cruel expositor of his own weaknesses, by Kneller; Sir\r\nA. Southwell, by the same portrait-painter; Dr. Birch, the great\r\nhistorical compiler, by Wills (the original of the mezzotint done by Faber\r\nin 1741, and bequeathed by Dr. Birch); Martin Folkes, the great\r\nantiquarian, by Hogarth; Dr. Wollaston, the eccentric discoverer, by\r\nJackson; and Sir Humphrey Davy, by Sir Thomas Lawrence.\r\n\r\nAmongst the curiosities of the society are the silver-gilt mace presented\r\nto the society by Charles II. in 1662--(long supposed to be the bauble\r\nwhich Cromwell treated with such contempt); a solar dial, made by Sir\r\nIsaac Newton himself when a boy; a reflecting telescope, made by Newton in\r\n1671; the precious MS. of the _Principia_ in Newton’s handwriting; a\r\nsilvery lock of Newton’s hair; the MS. of the _Parentalia, or Memoirs of\r\nthe Family of the Wrens_, written by young Wren; the charter-book of the\r\nsociety, bound in crimson velvet, and containing the signatures of the\r\nfounder and fellows; a Rumford fireplace, one of the earliest in use; and\r\na marble bust of Mrs. Somerville, the great mathematician and philosopher,\r\nby Chantrey. The society gives annually two gold medals--one the Rumford,\r\nthe other the Copley medal, called by Sir Humphrey Davy “the ancient olive\r\ncrown of the Royal Society.”\r\n\r\nThe Geological Society has a museum of specimens and fossils from all\r\nquarters of the globe. The number of its fellows is about 875, and the\r\ntime of meeting alternate Wednesday evenings from November till June. It\r\nalso publishes a quarterly journal. The entrance-money is six guineas, the\r\nannual subscription two.\r\n\r\nThe Society of Antiquaries was fairly started in 1707, by Wanley, Bagford,\r\nand Talman, who agreed to meet together every Friday under penalty of\r\nsixpence. It had originated about 1580, when it held its first sittings in\r\nthe Heralds’ College; but it did not obtain a charter till 1751, both\r\nElizabeth and James being afraid of its meddling with royal prerogatives\r\nand illustrious genealogies, and the Civil War having interrupted its\r\nproceedings. Its first meeting was at the Bear Tavern, in the Strand. In\r\n1739 the members were limited to one hundred, and the terms were one\r\nguinea entrance and twelve shillings annually. The society agreed to\r\ndiscuss antiquarian subjects, and chiefly those relating to English\r\nhistory prior to James I. In 1751 George II. granted its members a\r\ncharter, and in 1777 George III. gave them apartments in Somerset House,\r\nwhere they continued till their recent removal to Burlington House. The\r\nterms now are eight guineas admission, and four guineas annually. The\r\n_Archæologia_, a journal of the society’s proceedings, commenced in 1770.\r\nThe meetings are every Thursday evening from November to June, and the\r\nanniversary meeting is the 23d of April.\r\n\r\nThe museum of this society contains, among other treasures, the _Household\r\nBook_ of the Duke of Norfolk; a large and valuable collection of early\r\nproclamations and ballads; T. Porter’s unique map of London (Charles I.);\r\na folding picture in panel, of the “Preaching at Old St. Paul’s in 1616;”\r\nearly portraits of Edward IV. and Richard III., engraved for the third\r\nseries of _Ellis’s Letters_; a three-quarter portrait of Mary I. with the\r\nmonogram of Lucas de Heere, and the date 1546; a curious portrait of the\r\nMarquis of Winchester (who died 1571); the portrait by Sir Antonio More,\r\nof Schorel, a Dutch painter; portraits of antiquaries--Burton, the\r\nLeicestershire antiquary, Peter le Neve, Humphrey Wanley Baker, of St.\r\nJohn’s College, William Stukeley, George Vertue, and Edward, Earl of\r\nOxford, presented by Vertue; a Bohemian astronomical clock of gilt brass,\r\nmade in 1525 for Sigismund, King of Poland, and bought at the sale of the\r\neffects of James Ferguson, the astronomer; and a spur of gilt brass, found\r\non Towton field, the scene of the bloody conflict between Edward IV. and\r\nthe Lancastrian forces. Upon the shank is engraved the following\r\nposey--“En loial amour tout mon coer.”[122]\r\n\r\nThe Astronomical Society was instituted in 1820, and received the royal\r\ncharter in 1st William IV. The entrance-money is two guineas, and the\r\nannual subscription the same amount. The annual general meeting is the\r\nsecond Friday in February. A medal is awarded every year. The society has\r\na small but good mathematical library, and a few astronomical instruments.\r\n\r\nA little above the entrance door to “the Stamps and Taxes” there is a\r\nwhite watch-face let into the wall. Local tradition declares it was left\r\nthere in votive gratitude by a labourer who fell from a scaffolding and\r\nwas saved by the ribbon of his watch catching in some ornament. It was\r\nreally placed there by the Royal Society as a meridian mark for a portable\r\ntransit instrument in a window of an ante-room.[123]\r\n\r\nA tradition of Nelson belongs to this quiet square. An old clerk at\r\nSomerset House used to describe seeing the hero of the Nile pass on his\r\nway to the Admiralty. Thin and frail, with only one arm, he would enter\r\nthe vestibule at a smart pace, and make direct for his goal, pushing\r\nacross the rough round stones of the quadrangle, instead of taking, like\r\nothers, the smooth pavement. Nelson always took the nearest way to the\r\nobject he wished to attain.[124]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Academy soon found a home in Somerset House. Germs of this\r\ninstitution are to be found as early as the reign of Charles I., when Sir\r\nFrancis Kynaston, a translator of Chaucer into Latin (_circa_ 1636), was\r\nchosen regent of an academy in Covent Garden.[125]\r\n\r\nIn 1643 that shifty adventurer, Sir Balthazar Gerbier, who had been fellow\r\nambassador with Rubens in Spain, started some quack establishment of the\r\nsame kind at Bethnal Green. He afterwards went to Surinam, was turned out\r\nby the Dutch, came back, designed an ugly house at Hampstead Marshal, in\r\nBerks, and died in 1667.\r\n\r\nIn 1711 Sir Godfrey Kneller instituted a private art academy, of which he\r\nbecame president. Hogarth, writing about 1760, says, that sixty years\r\nbefore some artists had started an academy, but their leaders assuming too\r\nmuch pomposity, a caricature procession was drawn on the walls of the\r\nstudio, upon which the society broke up in dudgeon. Sir James Thornhill,\r\nin 1724, then set up an academy at his own house in Covent Garden, while\r\nothers, under Vanderbank, turned a neighbouring meeting-house into a\r\nstudio; but these rival confederations broke up at Sir James’s death in\r\n1734.\r\n\r\nHogarth, his son-in-law, opened an academy, under the direction of Mr.\r\nMoser, at the house of a painter named Peter Hyde, in Greyhound Court,\r\nArundel Street. In 1739 these artists removed to a more commodious house\r\nin Peter’s Court, St. Martin’s Lane, where they continued till 1767, when\r\nthey removed to Pall Mall.\r\n\r\nIn 1738 the Duke of Richmond threw open to art-students his gallery at\r\nWhitehall, closed it again when his absence in the German war prevented\r\nthe paying of the premiums, was laughed at, and then re-opened it again.\r\nIt lasted some years, and Edwards, author of the _Anecdotes_, studied\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn 1753 some artists meeting at the Turk’s Head, Gerrard Street, Soho,\r\ntried ineffectually to organise an academy; but in 1765 they obtained a\r\ncharter, and appointed Mr. Lambert president.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 their first exhibition of pictures was held in the rooms of the\r\nSociety of Arts, and in 1761 there were two exhibitions, one at Spring\r\nGardens: for the latter Hogarth illustrated a catalogue, with a compliment\r\nto the young king and a caricature of rich connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nIn 1768 eight of the directors of the Spring Gardens Society, indignant at\r\nMr. Kirby being made president of the society in the place of Mr. Hayman,\r\nresigned; and, co-operating with sixteen others who had been ejected,\r\nsecretly founded a new society. Wilton, Chambers, West, Cotes, and Moser,\r\nwere the leaders in this scheme, and Reynolds soon joined them, tempted,\r\nit is supposed, by a promise of knighthood.\r\n\r\nWest was the chief mover in this intrigue. The Archbishop of York, who had\r\ntried to raise £3000 to enable the American artist to abandon\r\nportrait-painting, had gained the royal ear, and West was painting the\r\n“Departure of Regulus” for the king, who was even persuaded and flattered\r\ninto drawing up several of the laws of the new society with his own\r\nhand.[126] The king, in the meantime, with unworthy dissimulation,\r\naffected outwardly a complete neutrality between the two camps, presented\r\nthe Spring Gardens Society with £100, and even attended their exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe king’s patronage of the new society was disclosed to honest Mr. Kirby\r\n(father of Mrs. Trimmer, and the artist who had taught the king\r\nperspective) in a very malicious and mortifying manner, and the story was\r\nrelated to Mr. Galt by West, with a quiet, cold spite, peculiarly his own.\r\nMr. Kirby came to the palace just as West was submitting his sketch for\r\n“Regulus” to the king. West was a true courtier, and knew well how to make\r\na patron suggest his own subject. Kirby praised the picture, and hoped Mr.\r\nWest intended to exhibit it. The Quaker slily replied that that depended\r\non his majesty’s pleasure. The king, like a true confederate, immediately\r\nsaid, “Assuredly I shall be happy to let the work be shown to the public.”\r\n“Then, Mr. West,” said the perhaps too arrogant president, “you will send\r\nit to my exhibition?” “No!” said the king, and the words must have been\r\nthunderbolts to poor Kirby; “it must go to _my_ exhibition.”[127] “Poor\r\nKirby,” says West, “only two nights before, had declared that the design\r\nof forming such an institution was not contemplated. His colour forsook\r\nhim--his countenance became yellow with mortification--he bowed with\r\nprofound humility, and instantly retired, _nor did he long survive the\r\nshock_!”\r\n\r\nMr. West is wrong, however, in the last statement, for his rival did not\r\ndie till 1774. Mr. Kirby, a most estimable man, was originally a\r\nhouse-painter at Ipswich. He became acquainted with Gainsborough, was\r\nintroduced by Lord Bute to the king, and wrote and edited some valuable\r\nworks on perspective, to one of which Hogarth contributed an inimitable\r\nfrontispiece.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Strange says that much of this intrigue was carried out by Mr.\r\nDalton,[128] a print seller in Pall Mall, and the king’s librarian, in\r\nwhose rooms the exhibition was held in 1767 and 1768.\r\n\r\nThus an American Quaker, a Swiss, and a Swede--(a gold-chaser, a\r\ncoach-painter, an architect, and a third-rate painter, West)--ignobly\r\nestablished the Royal Academy. Many eminent men refused to join the new\r\nsociety. Allan Ramsay, Hudson, Scott the marine-painter, and Romney were\r\nopposed to it. Engravers (much to the disgrace of the Academy) were\r\nexcluded; and worst of all, one of the new laws forbade any artist to be\r\neligible to academic honours who did not exhibit his works in the\r\nAcademy’s rooms: thus depriving for ever every English artist of the right\r\nto earn money by exhibiting his own works.[129]\r\n\r\nThe proportion of foreigners in the Academy was very large. The two ladies\r\nwho became members (Angelica Kauffmann and Mrs. Moser) were both\r\nSwiss.[130]\r\n\r\nThe other unlucky society, deprived of its share of the St. Martin’s Lane\r\ncasts, etc., and shut out from the Academy, furnished a studio over the\r\nCyder Cellars in Maiden Lane, struggled on till 1807, and then ceased to\r\nexist.[131]\r\n\r\nThe Academy, with all its tyranny and injustice, has still been useful to\r\nEnglish art in perpetuating annual exhibitions which attract purchasers.\r\nBut what did more good to English art than twenty academies was the king’s\r\npatronage of West, the spread of engraving, and the rise of middle-class\r\npurchasers, who rendered it no longer necessary for artists to depend on\r\nthe caprice and folly of rich aristocratic patrons.\r\n\r\nOne word more about the art oligarchy. The first officers of the new\r\nsociety were--Reynolds, president; Moser, keeper; Newton, secretary;\r\nPenny, professor of painting; Sandby, professor of architecture; Wale,\r\nprofessor of perspective; W. Hunter, professor of anatomy; Chambers,\r\ntreasurer; and Wilson, librarian. Goldsmith was chosen professor of\r\nhistory at a later period.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of the first exhibition of the Royal Academy contains the\r\nnames of only one hundred and thirty pictures: Hayman exhibited scenes\r\nfrom _Don Quixote_; Rooker some Liverpool views; Reynolds some allegorised\r\nportraits; Miss Kauffmann some of her tame Homeric figures; West his\r\n“Regulus” (that killed Kirby), and a Venus and Adonis; Zuccarelli two\r\nlandscapes.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, the first year after the opening of the National Gallery, 1382\r\nworks of art, including busts and architectural designs, were exhibited.\r\nAmong the pictures then shown were--Stanfield’s “Chasse Marée off the\r\nGulf-stream Light,” “The Privy Council,” by Wilkie; portraits of men and\r\ndogs, by Landseer; “The Pifferari,” “Phryne,” and “Banishment of Ovid,” by\r\nTurner; “A Bacchante,” by Etty; “Gaston de Foix,” by Eastlake; Allan’s\r\n“Slave Market,” Leslie’s “Dinner Scene from the Merry Wives of Windsor;”\r\n“A View on the Rhine,” by Callcott; Shee’s portrait of Sir Francis\r\nBurdett; portraits by Pickersgill; Maclise’s “Christmas in the Olden\r\nTime,” and “Olivia and Sophia fitting out Moses for the Fair;” “The\r\nMassacre of the Innocents,” by Hilton; and a picture by Uwins.[132]\r\n\r\nAngelica Kauffmann and Biaggio Rebecca helped to decorate the Academy’s\r\nold council-chamber at Somerset House. The paintings still exist. Rebecca\r\nwas an eccentric, conceited Italian artist, who decorated several rooms at\r\nWindsor, and offended the worthy precise old king by his practical jokes.\r\nOn one occasion, knowing he would meet the king on his way to Windsor with\r\nWest, he stuck a paper star on his coat. The next time West came, the king\r\nwas curious to know who the foreign nobleman was he had seen--“Person of\r\ndistinction, eh? eh?”--and was doubtless vexed at the joke.\r\n\r\nRebecca’s favourite trick was to draw a half-crown on paper, and place it\r\non the floor of one of the ante-rooms at Windsor, laughing immoderately at\r\nthe eagerness with which some fat courtier in full dress, sword and bag,\r\nwould run and scuffle to pick it up.[133]\r\n\r\nFuseli took his place as Keeper of the Academy in 1805. Smirke had been\r\nelected, but George III., hearing that he was a democrat, refused to\r\nconfirm the appointment. Haydon, who called on Fuseli in Berners Street in\r\n1805, when he had left his father the bookseller at Plymouth, describes\r\nhim as “a little white-headed, lion-faced man, in an old flannel\r\ndressing-gown tied round his waist with a piece of rope, and upon his head\r\nthe bottom of Mrs. Fuseli’s work-basket.” His gallery was full of\r\ngalvanised devils, malicious witches brewing incantations, Satan bridging\r\nchaos or springing upwards like a pyramid of fire, Lady Macbeth, Paolo and\r\nFrancesca, Falstaff and Mrs. Quickly.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the impetuous Haydon sketches him vigorously. Fuseli was about\r\nfive feet five inches high, had a compact little form, stood firmly at his\r\neasel, painted with his left hand, never held his palette upon his thumb,\r\nbut kept it upon his stone slab, and being very near-sighted and too vain\r\nto wear glasses, used to dab his beastly brush into the oil, and sweeping\r\nround the palette in the dark, take up a great lump of white, red, or\r\nblue, and plaster it over a shoulder or a face; then prying close in, he\r\nwould turn round and say, “By Gode! dat’s a fine purple! it’s very like\r\nCorreggio, by Gode!” and then all of a sudden burst out with a quotation\r\nfrom Homer, Tasso, Dante, Ovid, Virgil, or the Niebelungen, and say,\r\n“Paint dat!” “I found him,” says Haydon, “a most grotesque mixture of\r\nliterature, art, scepticism, indelicacy, profanity, and kindness. He put\r\nme in mind of Archimago in Spenser.”[134]\r\n\r\nWhen Haydon came first to town from Plymouth, he lodged at 342\r\nStrand,[135] near Charing Cross, and close to his fellow-student, the\r\ngood-natured, indolent, clever Jackson. The very morning he arrived he\r\nhurried off to the Exhibition, and mistaking the new church in the Strand\r\nfor Somerset House, ran up the steps and offered his shilling to a beadle.\r\nWhen he at last found the right house, Opie’s _Gil Blas_ and Westall’s\r\n_Shipwrecked Sailor Boy_ were all the historical pictures he could find.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua read his first discourse before the Academy in 1769. Barry\r\ncommenced his lectures in 1784, ended them in 1798, and was expelled the\r\nAcademy in 1799. Opie delivered his lectures in 1807, the year in which he\r\ndied. Fuseli began in 1801, and delivered but twelve lectures in all.\r\n\r\nIt was on St. George’s Day, 1771, that Sir Joshua Reynolds took the chair\r\nat the first annual dinner of the Royal Academy. Dr. Johnson was there,\r\nwith Goldsmith and Horace Walpole. Goldsmith got the ear of the company,\r\nbut was laughed at by Johnson for professing his enthusiastic belief in\r\nChatterton’s discovery of ancient poems. Walpole, who had believed in the\r\npoet of Bristol till he was laughed at by Mason and Gray, began to banter\r\nGoldsmith on his opinions, when, as he says, to his surprise and concern,\r\nand the dashing of his mirth, he first heard that the poor lad had been to\r\nLondon and had destroyed himself. Goldsmith had afterwards a quarrel with\r\nDr. Percy on the same subject.\r\n\r\nOne day, while Reynolds was lecturing at Somerset House, the floor\r\nsuddenly began to give way. Turner, then a boy, was standing near the\r\nlecturer. Reynolds remained calm, and said afterwards that his only\r\nthought was what a loss to English art the death of that roomful would\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Mr. Wale, the Professor of Perspective, Sir Joshua was\r\nanxious to have Mr. Bonomi elected to the post, but he was treated with\r\ngreat disrespect by Mr. Copley and others, who refused to look at Bonomi’s\r\ndrawings, which Sir Joshua (as some maintained, contrary to rule) had\r\nproduced at Fuseli’s election as Academician. Reynolds at first threatened\r\nto resign the presidency; but thought better of it afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn the catalogues in 1808 Turner’s name first appeared with the title of\r\nProfessor of Perspective attached to it. His lectures were bad, from his\r\nutter want of language, but he took great pains with his diagrams, and his\r\nideas were often original. On one celebrated occasion Turner arrived in\r\nthe lecture-room late, and much perturbed. He dived first into one pocket,\r\nand then into another; at last he ejaculated these memorable words:\r\n“Gentlemen, I’ve been and left my lecture in the hackney-coach!”[136]\r\n\r\nIn 1779 O’Keefe describes a visit paid to Somerset House to hear Dr.\r\nWilliam Hunter lecture on anatomy. He describes him as a jocose little\r\nman, in “a handsome modest” wig. A skeleton hung on a pivot by his side,\r\nand on his other hand stood a young man half stripped. Every now and then\r\nhe paused, to turn to the dead or the living example.[137]\r\n\r\nIn 1765, when Fuseli was living humbly in Cranbourn Alley, and translating\r\nWinckelmann, he used to visit Smollett, whose _Peregrine Pickle_ he was\r\nthen illustrating; and also Falconer, the author of _The Shipwreck_, who,\r\nbeing poor, was allowed to occupy apartments in Somerset House.[138] The\r\npoet was a mild, inoffensive man, the son of an Edinburgh barber. He had\r\nbeen apprenticed on board a merchant vessel, after which he entered the\r\nroyal navy. In 1762 he published his well-known poem. He went out to India\r\nin 1769, in the _Aurora_, which is supposed to have foundered in the\r\nMozambique Channel.[139] Falconer was a short thin man, with a\r\nhard-featured, weather-beaten face and a forbidding manner; but he was\r\ncheerful and generous, and much liked by his messmates. That hearty\r\nsea-song, “Cease, rude Boreas,” has been attributed to him.\r\n\r\nFuseli succeeded Barry as Lecturer on Painting in 1799, and became Keeper\r\non the death of Wilton, the sculptor, in 1803. He died in 1825, aged\r\neighty-four, and was buried in St. Paul’s, between Reynolds and Opie.\r\nLawrence, Beechey, Reinagle, Chalon, Jones, and Mulready followed him to\r\nhis stately grave. The body had previously been laid in state in Somerset\r\nHouse, his pictures of “The Lazar House” and “The Bridging of Chaos” being\r\nhung over the coffin.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Joshua died, in 1792, his body lay in state in a velvet coffin,\r\nin a room hung with sable, in Somerset House. Burke and Barry, Boswell and\r\nLangton, Kemble and John Hunter, Towneley and Angerstein came to witness\r\nthe ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhere events are so interwoven as they are in topographical history, I\r\nhope to be pardoned if I am not always chronological in my arrangement,\r\nfor it must be remembered that I have anecdotes to attend to as well as\r\ndates. Let me here, then, dilate on a cruel instance of misused academic\r\npower. My story relates to a young genius as unfortunate as Chatterton,\r\nyet guiltless of his lies and forgeries, who died heart-broken by neglect\r\nmore than half a century ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOMERSET HOUSE FROM THE STRAND, 1777.]\r\n\r\nProcter, a young Yorkshire clerk, came up to London in 1777, and became a\r\nstudent of the Royal Academy. In 1783 he carried off a silver medal, and\r\nthe next year won the gold medal for an historical picture. When Procter\r\ngained this last prize, his fellow-students, raising him on their\r\nshoulders, bore him downstairs, and then round the quadrangle of Somerset\r\nHouse, shouting out, “Procter! Procter!” Barry was delighted at this, and\r\nexclaimed with an oath, “Bedad! the lads have caught the true spirit of\r\nthe ould Greeks.” Sir Abraham Hume bought Procter’s “Ixion,” which was\r\npraised by Reynolds. His colossal “Diomede” the poor fellow had to break\r\nup, as he had no place to keep it in, and no one would buy it. In 1794 Mr.\r\nWest, wishing that Procter should go to Rome as the travelling student,\r\ndiscovered him, after much inquiry, in poor lodgings in Maiden Lane. A day\r\nor two afterwards he was found dead in his bed. The Academicians had been,\r\nperhaps, just a little too late with their patronage.[140]\r\n\r\nAnd now, when through grey twilight glooms I steal a glance as I pass by\r\nat that grave black figure of the river god, presiding solemn as\r\nRhadamanthus over the central quadrangle of Somerset House, I sometimes\r\ndream I see little leonine Fuseli, stormy Barry, and courtly Reynolds\r\npacing together the dim quadrangle that on these autumnal evenings, when\r\nthe rifle drills are over, wears so lonely and purgatorial an aspect; and\r\nfar away from them, in murky corners, I fancy I hear muttering the ghosts\r\nof Portuguese monks, while scowling at them, stalks by pale Sir\r\nEdmondbury, with a sword run through his shadowy body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACOB TONSON’S BOOK-SHOP, 1742.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE STRAND (SOUTH SIDE, CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Thames, off Somerset House, was a timber shed built on a strong\r\nbarge, and called “the Folly.” In William III.’s reign it was anchored\r\nhigher up the stream, near the Savoy. Tom Brown calls it “a musical\r\nsummer-house.” Its real name was “The Royal Diversion.” Queen Mary\r\nhonoured it with her presence.[141] It was at first frequented by “persons\r\nof quality,” but latterly it became disreputable, and its orchestra and\r\nrefreshment alcoves were haunted by thieves, gamesters, and courtesans.\r\n\r\nNear the Savoy stood the palace of the bishops of Carlisle, which was\r\nobtained by exchange with Henry VIII. for Rochester Place at Lambeth. The\r\nEnglish sultan gave it to his lucky favourite, Bedford, who took it as his\r\nresidence. In the reign of James I. the Earl of Worcester bought it; and\r\nin 1627 the Duke of Beaufort let it to Lord Clarendon, while his ill-fated\r\nhouse was building in Piccadilly. It was then rebuilt on a smaller scale\r\nby the duke, and eventually burnt down in 1695.[142] The present Beaufort\r\nBuildings were then erected. Beaufort House, which occupies the site of\r\none in which Cardinal Beaufort died, is now a printing-office.\r\n\r\nBlake, the mystical painter, died in 1828, at No. 3 Fountain Court, after\r\nfive years’ residence there. In these dim rooms he believed he saw the\r\nghost of a flea, Satan himself looking through the bars of the staircase\r\nwindow, to say nothing of hosts of saints, angels, evil spirits, and\r\nfairies. Here also he wrote verse passionate as Shelley’s and pure and\r\nsimple-hearted as Wordsworth’s. Here he engraved, tinted, railed at\r\nWoollett, and raved over his Dante illustrations; for though poor and\r\nunknown, he was yet regal in his exulting self-confidence. Here, just\r\nbefore his death, the old man sat up in bed, painting, singing, and\r\nrejoicing. He died without a struggle.[143]\r\n\r\nThe office of the _Sun_ is on this side the Strand. This paper was\r\nestablished in 1792. Mr. Jerdan left the _Sun_ in 1816, selling his share\r\nfor £300. He had quarrelled with the co-proprietor, Mr. John Taylor, who\r\naspired to a control over him. In 1817 he set up the _Literary Gazette_,\r\nthe first exclusive organ of literary men.[144] The first editor of the\r\n_Sun_ got an appointment in the West Indies. The paper was then edited by\r\nRobert Clark, printer of the _London Gazette_, and afterwards by Jerdan,\r\nassisted by Fladgate the facetious lawyer, Mulloch, and John Taylor. After\r\ngetting his sop in the pan of £300 a year from Government, that\r\nlow-principled satirist, Dr. Wolcot (Peter Pindar), wrote epigrams for it.\r\n\r\nFountain Court was in Strype’s time famous for an adjacent tavern from\r\nwhich it derived its name. It was well paved, and its houses were\r\nrespectably inhabited.[145] The Fountain Tavern was renowned for its good\r\nrooms, excellent vaults, “curious kitchen,” and old wine. The Fountain\r\nClub, of which Pulteney was a member (circa 1737), held its meetings in\r\nthis tavern, to oppose that fine old Whig gentleman Sir Robert\r\nWalpole.[146] Sir Charles Hanbury Williams thus mentions it in one of his\r\nlampoons:--\r\n\r\n  “Then enlarge on his cunning and wit,\r\n    Say how he harangued at the Fountain,\r\n  Say how the old patriots were bit,\r\n    And a mouse was produced by a mountain.”\r\n\r\nHere Pulteney may have planned the _Craftsman_ with Bolingbroke, and\r\nperhaps have arranged his duel with Lord Hervey, the “Sporus” of Pope.\r\n\r\nDennis, the critic, mentions in his _Letters_ dining here with Loggen, the\r\npainter, and Wilson, a writer praised by poor Otway in Tonson’s first\r\n_Miscellany_. “After supper,” he says, “we drank Mr. Wycherly’s health by\r\nthe name of Captain Wycherly.”[147] This was the dramatist, the celebrated\r\nauthor of _The Plain Dealer_ and _The Country Wife_.\r\n\r\nThe great room of the Fountain Tavern was afterwards Akermann’s well-known\r\npicture shop; and is now Simpson’s cigar divan.\r\n\r\nCharles Lillie, the perfumer recommended by Steele in the _Tatler_ (Nos.\r\n92, 94), lived next door to the Fountain Tavern. He was burnt out and went\r\nto the east corner of Beaufort Buildings in 1709. Good-natured Steele,\r\npitying him probably for his losses, praised his Barcelona snuff, and his\r\norange-flower water prepared according to the Royal Society’s receipt.\r\n\r\nThe Coal Hole, in this court, was so named by Rhodes, its first landlord,\r\nfrom its having been originally the resort of coal-heavers. In his and\r\nEdmund Kean’s time it was respectably frequented. It was once the\r\n“Evans’s” of London, famous for steaks and ale; afterwards it sank to a\r\nlow den with _poses plastiques_ and ribald sham trials, that used to be\r\nconducted by “Baron” Nicholson, a fat gross man, but not without a certain\r\nunctuous humour, who is now dead.\r\n\r\nEdmund Kean, always low in his tastes, used to fly the society of men like\r\nLord Byron to come hither and smoke and drink. The dress, the ceremony,\r\nand the compulsory good behaviour of respectable society made him silent\r\nand melancholy.[148] He used to say that noblemen talked such nonsense\r\nabout the stage, and that only literary men understood the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Kit-Cat Club was instituted in 1700, and died away about the year\r\n1720. There were originally thirty-nine members, and they increased\r\ngradually to the forty-eight whose portraits Kneller painted for their\r\nsecretary, Jacob Tonson, Dryden’s bookseller. Their earliest rendezvous\r\nwas at the house of a pastry-cook, one Christopher Cat, in Shire Lane,\r\nnear Temple Bar. When he grew wealthier, the club removed with him to the\r\nFountain Tavern in the Strand. The club derived its name from the\r\ncelebrated mutton pie,[149] which had been christened after its\r\nmaker.[150] The first members were those Whig patriots who brought about\r\nthe Revolution and drove out King James. Their object was the\r\nencouragement of literature and the fine arts, and the diffusion of\r\nloyalty to the House of Hanover. They elected their “toast” for the year\r\nby ballot. The lady’s name, when chosen, was written on the club\r\ndrinking-glasses with a diamond. Among the more celebrated of the members\r\nof this club were Kneller, Vanbrugh, Congreve, Addison, Garth, Steele,\r\nLord Mohun, the Duke of Wharton, Sir Robert Walpole, the Earl of\r\nBurlington, the Earl of Bath, the Earl of Dorset, the Earl of Halifax, the\r\nproud Duke of Somerset, and the Duke of Newcastle.\r\n\r\nIn summer the Club met at Tonson’s house at Barn Elms in Surrey, or at the\r\nUpper Flask Tavern at Hampstead.[151] There seems to have been always some\r\ndoubt about the derivation of the name of the club; for an epigram still\r\nextant, written either by Pope or Arbuthnot, attributes the name to the\r\nfact of the members toasting “old Cats and young kits.” Mr. Defoe mentions\r\nthe landlord’s name as Christopher Catt,[152] while Ned Ward says that\r\nthough his name was Christopher, he lived at the sign of the Cat and\r\nFiddle.\r\n\r\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu was once brought by her father to this club when\r\na child, and made the toast for the year. “Petted, praised, fondled, and\r\nfed with sweetmeats,” she used to say in her old age that it was the\r\nhappiest day of her life![153]\r\n\r\nNo. 59 is Coutts’s Bank. It was built for Mr. Coutts, in 1768, by the Adam\r\nbrothers--to whom we are indebted for the Adelphi. The old house of the\r\nfirm, of the date of Queen Anne, was situated in St. Martin’s Lane. The\r\npresent house contains some fine marble chimney-pieces of the Cipriani and\r\nBacon school. The dining-room is hung with quaint Chinese subjects on\r\npaper, sent to Mr. Coutts by Lord Macartney, while on his embassy to\r\nChina, in 1792-95. In another room hang portraits of some early friends of\r\nthis son of Mammon, including Dr. Armstrong, the poet and physician,\r\nFuseli’s friend, by Reynolds. The strong rooms consist of cloistered\r\nvaults, wherein the noblemen and rich commoners who bank in the house\r\ndeposit patents, title-deeds, and plate of fabulous value.\r\n\r\nMr. Coutts was the son of a Dundee merchant. His first wife was a servant,\r\na Lancashire labourer’s offspring. He had three daughters, one of whom\r\nbecame the wife of Sir Francis Burdett, a second Countess of Guilford, and\r\na third Marchioness of Bute. On becoming acquainted with Miss Mellon, and\r\ninducing her to leave the stage to avoid perpetual insults, Mr. Coutts\r\nbought for her of Sir W. Vane Tempest, a small villa called Holly Lodge,\r\nat the foot of Highgate Hill, for which he gave £25,000. His banking-house\r\nstrong rooms alone cost £10,000 building. The first deposit in the\r\nenlarged house was the diamond aigrette that the Grand Signor had placed\r\nin Nelson’s hat. Mr. Coutts, though very charitable, was precise and\r\nexact. On one occasion, there being a deficit of 2s. 10d. in the day’s\r\naccounts, the clerks were detained for hours, or, as is said, all night.\r\nOne of Coutts’s clerks, who took the western walk, was discovered to be\r\nmissing with £17,000.[154] Rewards were offered, and the town placarded,\r\nbut all in vain. The next day, however, the note-case arrived from\r\nSouthampton. The clerk’s story was, that on his way through Piccadilly,\r\nbeing seized with a stupor, he had got into a coach in order to secure the\r\nmoney. He had remained insensible the whole journey, and had awoke at\r\nSouthampton. Mr. Coutts gave him a handsome sum from his private purse,\r\nbut dismissed him.\r\n\r\nCoutts’s Bank stands on nearly the centre of the site of the “New\r\nExchange.” When the Adelphi was built in Durham Gardens, Mr. Coutts\r\npurchased a vista to prevent his view being interrupted, stipulating that\r\nthe new street leading to the entrance should face this opening; and on\r\nthis space, up to the level of the Strand, he built his strong rooms. Some\r\nyears after, wishing to enlarge them, he erected over the office a\r\ncounting-house and a set of offices extending from William Street to\r\nRobert Street, and threw a stone bridge over William Street to connect the\r\nfront and back premises.\r\n\r\nMr. Coutts, late in life, married Harriet Mellon, who, after his death,\r\nbecame the wife of the Duke of St. Albans, a descendant of Nell Gwynn,\r\nthat light-hearted wanton, whom nobody could hate. “Miss Mellon,” says\r\nLeigh Hunt, “was arch and agreeable on the stage; she had no genius; but\r\nthen she had fine eyes and a good-humoured mouth.” The same gay writer\r\ndescribes her when young as bustling about at sea-ports, selling tickets\r\nfor her benefit-night; but then, says the kindly apologist for everybody,\r\nshe had been left with a mother to support.[155]\r\n\r\nEdmund Kean, the great tragedian, was lodging at 21 Cecil Street when,\r\npoor and unknown, he made his first great triumph as Shylock, at Drury\r\nLane; a few days after, his mantelpiece was strewn with bank-notes, and\r\nhis son Charles was seen sitting on the floor playing with a heap of\r\nguineas.[156] This great actor brought the theatre, in sixty-eight nights\r\nof 1814, no less than twenty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThe last house on the west side of Cecil Street was inhabited in 1706 by\r\nLord Gray, and in 1721-4 by the Archbishop of York. In the opposite house\r\nlived for many years Major-General Sir William Congreve, the inventor of\r\nthe rockets which bear his name, and a great friend and companion of\r\nGeorge IV., to whom he is said to have borne a striking personal\r\nresemblance. Sir William was a descendant of Congreve the dramatist; and\r\nhe was the inventor of a number of successful projects and contrivances,\r\namong which may be mentioned the engines employed in dredging the Thames.\r\nThe east side of Cecil Street is in the Savoy precinct, the west in the\r\nparish of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields.\r\n\r\nDr. Wollaston was living in Cecil Street (No. 28) in the year 1800. This\r\neccentric philosopher, originally a physician, was born in 1766, and died\r\nof brain disease in 1828. He discovered two new metals--palladium and\r\nrhodium--and acquired more than £30,000, by inventing a plan to make\r\nplatinum malleable. He improved and invented the camera lucida, and was\r\nthe first to demonstrate the identity of galvanism and common\r\nelectricity. He carried on his experiments with the simplest instruments,\r\nand never allowed even his most intimate friends to enter his laboratory.\r\nWhen a foreign philosopher once called on him and asked to see his study,\r\nhe instantly produced, in his strange way, a small tray, on which were\r\nsome glass tubes and a twopenny blow-pipe. Once, shortly after inspecting\r\na grand galvanic battery, on meeting a brother philosopher in the street\r\nhe led him by the button into a mysterious corner, took from his pocket a\r\ntailor’s thimble, poured into it some liquid from a small phial, and\r\ninstantly heated a platinum wire to a white heat.[157]\r\n\r\nSalisbury Street, in the Strand, was originally built about 1678, but was\r\nextensively rebuilt by Payne in the early part of the reign of George III.\r\n\r\nOld Salisbury House stood on the sites of Salisbury and Cecil Streets,\r\nbetween Worcester House, now Beaufort Buildings, and Durham House, now the\r\nAdelphi. It was so called after Sir Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, and\r\nLord High Treasurer to James I., who died 1612. Queen Elizabeth was\r\npresent at the house-warming. This Cecil was the bad minister of a bad\r\nking. He was Raleigh’s enemy and Bacon’s; he was the foe of reform, and\r\nthe friend of Spain, from whom he received bribes, and the slave of vice.\r\nBacon painted this vicious hunchback in his _Essay on Deformity_. The\r\nhouse was divided subsequently into Great and Little Salisbury House--the\r\nlatter being let to persons of quality. About 1678 it was pulled down, and\r\nSalisbury Street built; but it proved too steep and narrow, and was not a\r\nsuccessful speculation.[158] The other part, next to Great Salisbury House\r\nand over the Long Gallery, was turned into the “Middle Exchange.” This\r\neventually gave way to Cecil Street,--a fair street, with very good\r\nhouses, fit for persons of repute.[159]\r\n\r\nOn the death of Sackville the poet, Cecil took the white staff, being\r\nalready Premier-Secretary. His ambition stretched into every department of\r\nthe State. “He built a new palace at Hatfield, and a new Exchange in the\r\nStrand. Countesses intrigued for him. His son married a Howard, his\r\ndaughter a Clifford. Ambassadors started for Italy, less to see Doges and\r\nGrand Dukes than to pick up pictures and statues, and bronzes and\r\nhangings, for his vast establishment at Hatfield Chase. His gardeners\r\ntravelled through France to buy up mulberries and vines. Salisbury House,\r\non the Thames, almost rivalled the luxurious villas of the Roman\r\ncardinals; yet, under this blaze of worldly success, Cecil was the most\r\nmiserable of men. Friends grudged his rise; his health was broken; the\r\nreins which his ambition drew into his hands were beyond the powers of a\r\nsingle man to grasp; and the vigour of his frame, wasted by years of\r\nvoluptuous licence, failed him at the moment when the strain on his\r\nfaculties was at the full.”[160]\r\n\r\nIn Little Salisbury House lived William Cavendish, third Earl of\r\nDevonshire, and father of the first Duke of Devonshire, one of the leaders\r\nof the great revolution that drove out the Stuarts. Two or three days\r\nafter the Restoration, King Charles, passing in his coach through the\r\nStrand, espied Hobbes, that mischievous writer in favour of absolute\r\npower, standing at the door of his patron the earl. The king took off his\r\nhat very kindly to the old man, gave him his hand to kiss, asked after his\r\nhealth, ordered Cooper to take his portrait, and settled on him a pension\r\nof £100 a year. Hobbes had been an assistant of Bacon, and a friend of Ben\r\nJonson and of Lord Herbert of Cherbury. He had taught Charles II.\r\nmathematics, and corresponded with Descartes.\r\n\r\nIn the street standing on the site of Sir Robert Cecil’s house was the\r\nresidence of the famous Partridge, the cobbler, impudent sham-almanac\r\nmaker, and predecessor of our own Moore and Zadkiel, who had foretold the\r\ndeath of the French king. To expose this noisy charlatan and upset his\r\nridiculous hap-hazard predictions, Swift with cruel and trenchant malice\r\nreported and lamented his decease in the _Tatler_ (1708), to which he\r\ncontributed under the name of Bickerstaff. The article raised a laugh\r\nthat has not even quite died away in the present day. Partridge, furious\r\nat his losses and the extinguishing of his ill-earned fame, knocked down a\r\nhawker who passed his stall crying an account of his death. This happening\r\njust as the joke was fading, revived it again, and finally ruined the\r\nalmanac of poor Partridge.[161] “The villain,” says the poor outwitted\r\nastrologer, “told the world I was dead, and how I died, and that he was\r\nwith me at the time of my death. I thank God, by whose mercy I have my\r\nbeing, that I am still alive, and, excepting my age, as well as ever I was\r\nin my life.” He actually died in 1715.\r\n\r\nA little beyond Cecil Street formerly stood Ivy Bridge, under which there\r\nwas a narrow passage to the Thames, once forming a boundary line between\r\nthe Duchy of Lancaster and the City of Westminster. Near Ivy Bridge stood\r\nthe mansion of the Earls of Rutland. Opposite this spot Old Parr had\r\nlodgings when he came to court to be shown to Charles I., and died of the\r\nvisit. Parr was a Shropshire labourer. He was born in 1483, and died aged\r\n152. His grandson lived to 120, and in the year of his death had married a\r\nwidow. Parr’s London lodging became afterwards the Queen’s Head\r\npublic-house.[162]\r\n\r\nMrs. Siddons was living at 149 Strand, during the time of her earlier\r\nsuccesses. Probably she returned there on that glorious October night of\r\n1782, when she achieved her first great triumph in Southerne’s tragedy of\r\n_Isabella_, when her younger son, who acted with her, burst into tears,\r\novercome by the reality of the dying scene. “I never heard,” she says,\r\n“such peals of applause in all my life.” She returned home solemnly and\r\ncalmly, and sat down to a frugal, neat supper with her father and husband,\r\nin silence uninterrupted, except by exclamations of gladness from Mr.\r\nSiddons.\r\n\r\nDurham Street marks the site of old Durham House, built by Hatfield,\r\nBishop of Durham, in 1345. In Henry IV.’s time wild Prince Hal lodged\r\nthere for some nights.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry VIII. Bishop Tunstall exchanged the house with the\r\nking for one in Thames Street. Here, in 1550, lodged the French\r\nambassador, M. de Chastillon, and his colleagues.\r\n\r\nEdward VI. granted the house to his sister Elizabeth for life, and here\r\nthat princess bore the scorn and persecution of Bonner and his spies. On\r\nMary coming to the throne and finding Tunstall driven from the Strand and\r\nwithout a shelter, she restored to him Durham House. This Tunstall led a\r\nlife of great vicissitudes. Henry VIII. had moved him from London to\r\nDurham; Edward VI. had dissolved his bishopric altogether; Mary had\r\nrestored it; and Elizabeth again stripped him in 1559, the year in which\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\nThe virgin queen kept the house some time in her own tenacious hands, but\r\nin 1583 granted it to Raleigh, whom she had loaded with favours, and who,\r\nin 1591, was Captain of the Guard, Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and\r\nLieutenant of Cornwall.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Queen Elizabeth Raleigh’s sun of fortune set for ever, and\r\nthat sly time-server Toby Matthew, Bishop of Durham, claimed the old town\r\nhouse of the see, relying on Cecil’s help and King James’s dislike to the\r\ngreat enemy of Spain. Sir Walter opposed him, but the king in council,\r\n1603, recognised the claim, and stripped Raleigh of his possession. The\r\naggrieved man, in a letter of remonstrance to the Lord Keeper Egerton,\r\nstates that he had occupied the house about twenty years, and had expended\r\non it £2000 out of his own purse.[163] Raleigh did not die at Tower Hill\r\ntill 1618; but Durham House was never occupied again either by bishop or\r\nnoble, and five years after the stables of the house came down to make way\r\nfor the New Exchange.\r\n\r\nIn Charles I.’s reign the Earl of Pembroke bought Durham Yard from the\r\nBishop of Durham for £200 a year, and built a handsome street leading to\r\nthe river.[164] The river front and the stables remained in ruins till the\r\nMessrs. Adam built the Adelphi on the site of Raleigh’s old turret study.\r\nIvy Street had been the eastward boundary of the bishop’s domain.[165]\r\n\r\nThe New Exchange was opened April 11, 1609, in the presence of King James\r\nand his Danish queen. It was built principally through the intervention of\r\nCecil, Earl of Salisbury, who lived close by. It was called by the king\r\n“Britain’s Bourse,” but it could not at first compete with the Royal\r\nExchange. At the Restoration, however, when Covent Garden grew into a\r\nfashionable quarter, the New Exchange became more frequented than\r\nGresham’s building in the city.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1653 (Cromwell), the New Exchange was the scene of a tragedy.\r\nDon Pantaleon de Saa, brother of the Portuguese ambassador, quarrelled\r\nwith a gentleman named Giraud, who was flirting with the milliners, and\r\nwho had used some contemptuous expression. The Portuguese, bent on\r\nrevenge, hired some bravos, who the next day stabbed to death a gentleman\r\nwhom they mistook for Mr. Giraud. They were instantly seized, and Don\r\nPantaleon was found guilty and executed. Singularly enough, the intended\r\nvictim perished on the same day on the same scaffold, having in the\r\nmeantime been condemned for a plot against the Protector.\r\n\r\nThere are many legends existing about the New Exchange. Thomas Duffet, an\r\nactor of Charles II.’s time, kept originally a milliner’s shop here. At\r\nthe Eagle and Child, in Britain’s Bourse, the first edition of _Othello_\r\nwas sold in 1622. At the sign of the “Three Spanish Gypsies” lived Thomas\r\nRadford, who sold wash-balls, powder, and gloves, and taught sempstresses.\r\nHis wife, the daughter of John Clarges, a farrier in the Savoy before or\r\nafter Radford’s death, married General Monk, became the vulgar Duchess of\r\nAlbemarle, and was eventually buried in Westminster Abbey. At the sign of\r\nthe Fop’s Head lived, in 1674, Will Cademan, a player and\r\nplay-publisher.[166] Henry Herringham, the chief London publisher before\r\nDryden’s petty tyrant, Tonson, had his shop at the Blue Anchor in the\r\nLower Walk. Mr. and Mrs. Pepys frequented the New Exchange. Here the\r\nAdmiralty clerk’s wife had “a mind to” a petticoat of sarcenet bordered\r\nwith black lace, and probably purchased it. Here also, in April, 1664,\r\nPepys and his friend Creed partook of “a most delicate dish of curds and\r\ncream.”[167] Both Wycherly and Etherege have laid scenes of their comedies\r\nat the New Exchange; and here, too, Dryden’s intriguing Mrs. Brainsick\r\npretends to visit her “tailor” to try on her new stays.\r\n\r\nThis Strand Bazaar, in the time of William and Mary, was the scene of the\r\npretty story of the “White Widow.” For several weeks a sempstress appeared\r\nat one of the stalls, clothed in white, and wearing a white mask. She\r\nexcited great curiosity, and all the fashionable world thronged her stall.\r\nThis mysterious milliner was at last discovered to be no less a person\r\nthan the Duchess of Tyrconnel, widow of Talbot, the Lord Deputy of Ireland\r\nunder James II. Unable to obtain a secret access to her family, and almost\r\nstarving, she had been compelled to turn shopwoman. Her relatives provided\r\nfor her directly the story became known.[168] This duchess was the Frances\r\nJennings mentioned by Grammont, and sister to Sarah, Duchess of\r\nMarlborough.\r\n\r\nThis long arcade, leading from the Strand to the water stairs, was divided\r\ninto four parts--the outward walk below stairs, the inner walk below\r\nstairs, the outward walk above stairs, and the inner walk above stairs.\r\nThe lower walk was a place of assignations. In the upper walk the air rang\r\nwith cries of “Gloves or ribands, sir?” “Very good gloves or ribands.”\r\n“Choice of fine essences.”[169] Here Addison used to pace, watching the\r\nfops and fools with a kindly malice.[170] The houses in the Strand, over\r\nagainst the Exchange door, were often let to rich country families, who\r\nglared from the balconies and stared from the windows.[171]\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of Queen Anne the New Exchange became disreputable.\r\nNo one would take stalls, so it was pulled down in 1737, and a frontage of\r\ndwelling-houses and shops made to the Strand, facing what is now the\r\nAdelphi Theatre. But we must return for a moment to old Durham House and a\r\nfew more of its earlier tenants.\r\n\r\nIn Henry VIII.’s time Durham House had been the scene of great banquets\r\ngiven by the challengers after the six days’ tournament that celebrated\r\nthe butcher king’s ill-omened marriage with that “Flemish mare,” as he\r\nused ungallantly to call Anne of Cleves. To these sumptuous feasts the\r\nbruised and battered champions, together with all the House of Commons and\r\nCorporation of London, were invited. To reward the challengers, among whom\r\nwas Oliver Cromwell’s ancestor, Dick o’ the Diamond, the burly king gave\r\nthem each a yearly pension of one hundred marks out of the plundered\r\nrevenues of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nLater a mint was established at Durham House by Sir William Sherrington,\r\nto aid the Lord Admiral Seymour in his treasonable efforts against his\r\nbrother, the Protector, who finally offered him up a victim to his\r\nambition. Sherrington, however, escaped, and worked the mint for the\r\nequally unfortunate Protector.\r\n\r\nBut no loss of heads could warn the Strand noblemen. It was here that the\r\nambitious Duke of Northumberland married his son, Lord Guildford Dudley,\r\nto poor meek-hearted Lady Jane Grey, who, the luckless queen of an hour,\r\nlonged only for her Greek books, her good old tutor Ascham, and the quiet\r\ncountry house where she had been so happy. On that great day for the duke,\r\nLady Jane’s sister also married Lord Herbert, and Lord Hastings espoused\r\nLady Catherine Dudley. It was from Durham House that the poor martyr of\r\nambition, Lady Jane, was escorted in pomp to the Tower, which was so soon\r\nto be her grave.\r\n\r\nIn 1560 Jean Nicot, a French ambassador, had carried tobacco from Lisbon\r\nto Paris. In 1586[172] Drake brought tobacco from Raleigh’s colony in\r\nVirginia. Raleigh was fond of smoking over his books. His tobacco-box\r\nstill existed in 1715; it was of gilt leather, as large as a muff-case,\r\nand contained cases for sixteen pipes.[173] There is a doubtful legend\r\nabout Raleigh’s first pipe, the scene of which may be not unfairly laid at\r\nDurham House, where Raleigh then lived.\r\n\r\nOne day his servant, bringing in a tankard of spiced ale as usual into the\r\nturret study, found Raleigh (it is said) smoking a pipe over his folios.\r\nThe clown, seeing smoke issue in clouds from his master’s mouth, dropped\r\nthe tankard in a fright, and ran downstairs to shout to the family that\r\n“master was on fire, and that he would be burnt to ashes if they did not\r\nrun directly to his help.”[174]\r\n\r\nThe stalwart, sour-faced Raleigh disported himself at Durham House in a\r\nsuit of clothes beset with jewels and valued at sixty thousand\r\npounds,[175] and in diamond court-shoes valued at six thousand six hundred\r\npieces of gold. Here he lived with his wife Elizabeth, and his two unlucky\r\nsons Walter and Carew. Here, as he sat in his study in the little turret\r\nthat looked over the Thames,[176] he must have written against the\r\nSpaniards, told his adventures in Virginia, and described his discovery of\r\nthe gold country of Guiana, his quarrel with Essex at Fayal, and the\r\ncapture of the rich caracks laden with gold, pearls, and cochineal.\r\n\r\nThe estate of Durham Place was purchased from the Earl of Pembroke, about\r\n1760, by four brothers of the name of Adam, sons of an architect at\r\nKirkaldy, who were patronised by the handsome and much-abused Earl of\r\nBute, and who built Caen Wood House, near Hampstead, afterwards the wise\r\nLord Mansfield’s. Robert, the ablest of the brothers, had visited Palmyra,\r\nand was supposed from those gigantic ruins to have borrowed his grand\r\nspirit of construction, as well as much of that trivial ornament which he\r\nmight surely have found nearer home. When the brothers Adam began their\r\nwork, Durham Yard (the court-yard of Raleigh’s old house) was a tangle of\r\nsmall sheds, coal-stores, wine-vaults, and lay-stalls. They resolved to\r\nleave the wharves, throw some huge arches over the declivity, connect the\r\nriver with the Strand, and over these vaults erect a series of well-built\r\nstreets, a noble river terrace, and lofty rooms for the newly-established\r\nSociety of Arts.\r\n\r\nIn July 1768,[177] when the Adelphi Buildings were commenced, the Court\r\nand City were at war, and the citizens, wishing to vex Bute, applied to\r\nParliament to prevent the brothers encroaching on the river, of which\r\nsable stream the Lord Mayor of London is the conservator, but not the\r\npurifier; but they lost their cause, and the worthy Scotchmen\r\ntriumphed.[178]\r\n\r\nThe Scotch are a patriotic people, and stand bravely by their own folk.\r\nThe Adams sent to Scotland for workmen, whose labours they stimulated by\r\ncountless bagpipes; but the canny men, finding the bagpipes played their\r\ntunes rather too quick, threw up the work, and Irishmen were then\r\nemployed. The joke of the day was, that the Scotchmen took their bagpipes\r\naway with them, but left their _fiddles_![179]\r\n\r\nThe Adelphi at once became fashionable. Garrick, then getting old, left\r\nhis house in Southampton Street to occupy No. 5, the centre building of\r\nthe terrace, and lived there till his death in 1779. Singularly enough,\r\nthis great and versatile actor had, on first coming to London with his\r\nfriend Johnson, started as a wine merchant below in Durham Yard. Here he\r\nmust have raved in “Richard,” and wheedled as Abel Drugger; and in the\r\nrooms at No. 5 half the celebrities of his century must have met. He died\r\nin the “first floor back,” and his widow died in the same house as long\r\nafter as 1822. The ceiling in the front drawing-room was painted by\r\nAntonio Zucchi. A white marble chimney-piece in the same room is said to\r\nhave cost £300.[180] Garrick died after only nine years’ residence in the\r\nnew terrace; but his sprightly widow, a theatrical critic to the last,\r\nlived till she was past ninety, still an enthusiast about her husband’s\r\ngenius. The first time she re-opened the house after Davy’s death, Dr.\r\nJohnson, Boswell, Sir Joshua, Mrs. Carter, and Mrs. Boscawen were present.\r\n“She looked well,” says Boswell; “and while she cast her eyes on her\r\nhusband’s portrait, which was hung over the chimney-piece, said, that\r\ndeath was now the most agreeable object to her.” Worthy woman! and so she\r\nhonestly thought at the time; but she lived exactly forty-three years\r\nlonger in the same house.\r\n\r\nIf there is a spot in London which Johnson’s ghost might be expected to\r\nrevisit, it is that quiet and lonely Adelphi Terrace. At night no sound\r\ncomes to you but a shout from some passing barge, or the creak of a ship’s\r\nwindlass. Here Johnson and Boswell once leant over, looking at the Thames.\r\nThe latter said, “I was thinking of two friends we had lost, who once\r\nlived in the buildings behind us, Beauclerk and Garrick.” “Ay, sir,”\r\nreplied Johnson, seriously, “and two _such_ friends as cannot be\r\nsupplied.” This is a recollection that should for ever hallow the Adelphi\r\nTerrace to us.\r\n\r\nThe Beauclerk above mentioned was one of the few rakes whom Johnson loved.\r\nHe was a friend of Langton, and as such had become intimate with the great\r\ndoctor. Topham Beauclerk was a man of acute mind and elegant manners, and\r\nardently fond of literature. He was of the St. Albans family, and had a\r\nresemblance to swarthy Charles II., a point which pleased his elder\r\nfriend. The doctor liked his gay, young manner, and flattered himself much\r\nas women do who marry rakes, that he should reform him in time.\r\n\r\n“What a coalition!” said Garrick, when he heard of the friendship; “why, I\r\nshall have my old friend to bail out of the Round House.” Beauclerk, says\r\nBoswell, “could take more liberties with Johnson than any one I ever saw\r\nhim with;”[181] but, on the other hand, Beauclerk was not spared. On one\r\noccasion Johnson said to him, “You never open your mouth, sir, without an\r\nintention to give pain, and you have often given me pain--not from the\r\npower of what you said, but from seeing your intention.” At another time\r\nhe said, “Thy body is all vice, and thy mind all virtue.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Adelphi was building, Garrick applied for the corner house of\r\nAdam Street for his friend Andrew Beckett, the bookseller in the Strand,\r\nand he obtained it. In this letter he calls the architects “the dear\r\nAdelphi,” and the western house “the corner blessing.” Garrick’s house was\r\nfor some years occupied by the Royal Literary Fund, but is now a Club.\r\n\r\nGarrick promised the brothers, if the request was granted, to make the\r\nshop, as old Jacob Tonson’s once was, the rendezvous of the first people\r\nin England. “I have,” he says, “a little selfishness in this request. I\r\nnever go to coffee-houses, seldom to taverns, and should constantly (if\r\nthis scheme takes place), be at Beckett’s at one at noon and six at\r\nnight.”[182]\r\n\r\nGarrick was a frequent visitor at the house of Mr. Thomas Beckett, the\r\nbookseller, in Pall Mall, and he obtained the appointment of sub-librarian\r\nat Carlton Palace for the son Andrew, who had written a comedy on the\r\n_Emile_ of Rousseau at the age of fourteen, and produced a poem called\r\n_Theodosius and Constantia_. For nearly ten years he wrote for the British\r\nand Monthly Reviews. He was born in 1749, and died in 1843. His most\r\nuseful work is called _Shakspere Himself Again_, in which he released the\r\noriginal text from much muddy nonsense of commentators. He complained\r\nbitterly of Griffiths, of the _Monthly Review_, having given him only £45\r\nfor four or five years’ work--280 articles, produced after reading and\r\ncondensing 590 volumes; Mr. Griffiths’ annual profit by the _Monthly_\r\nbeing no less than £2000.\r\n\r\nInto a house in John Street the Society of Arts, established in 1753 by\r\nMr. Shipley, an artist, moved, about 1772. This society still give\r\nlectures and rewards, and does about as much good as ever it did. Art\r\nmust grow wild--it will not thrive in hot-houses. The great room is still\r\nadorned with the six large pictures illustrating the “Progress of\r\nSociety,” painted by poor, half-crazed Barry, the ill-educated artist,\r\nwho, too proud to paint cabinet pictures, could yet paint nothing larger\r\nsound or well.\r\n\r\nShipley, who established the society of Arts in imitation of one already\r\nestablished at Dublin, was originally a drawing-master at Northampton.\r\nFrom its commencement in 1753-4 to 1778 the society distributed in\r\npremiums and bounties £24,616. A year after its foundation Josiah Wedgwood\r\nbegan to infuse a classical and purer taste among the proprietors of the\r\nStaffordshire potteries,[183] and employed Flaxman to draw some of his\r\ndesigns, and was the first to improve the shape and character of our\r\nsimplest articles of use.\r\n\r\nMr. Shipley was a brother of the Bishop of St. Asaph, and had studied\r\nunder a portrait-painter named Phillips. In 1738 the Society of Arts voted\r\ntheir founder a gold medal for his public spirit. His school was continued\r\nby a Mr. Pars. He died, aged upwards of ninety, in 1784.[184]\r\n\r\nNollekens, the sculptor, learned drawing there, and Cosway, afterwards the\r\nfashionable miniature-painter, was the errand-boy. The house was\r\nsubsequently inhabited by Rawle, the antiquary, a friend of fat, coarse,\r\nclever Captain Grose.[185]\r\n\r\nDr. Ward, the inventor of “Friar’s Balsam,” a celebrated quack doctor\r\nridiculed by Hogarth, left his statue by Carlini to the Society of Arts.\r\nThe doctor allowed Carlini £100 a year, so that he should work at this\r\nstatue for life.[186]\r\n\r\nThis Joshua Ward, celebrated for his drop and pill, by which and his\r\nbalsam he made a fortune, was the son of a drysalter in Thames Street.\r\nPraised by General Churchill and Lord Chief Baron Reynolds, he was called\r\nin to prescribe for King George. The king recovering in spite of the\r\nquack, “Spot” Ward was rewarded by a solemn vote of a credulous House of\r\nCommons, and he obtained the privilege of being allowed to drive his\r\ncarriage through St. James’s Park. Ward is conspicuous in one of Hogarth’s\r\ncaricatures by a claret mark covering half his brazen face.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper at the Society of Arts in Haydon’s time (1842) remembered\r\nBarry at work on the frescoes that are so deficient in colour and taste,\r\nbut show such a fine grasp of mind. She said his violence was dreadful,\r\nhis oaths horrid, and his temper like insanity. In summer he came at five\r\nand worked till dark; he then lit his lamp and went on etching till eleven\r\nat night. He was seven years at his task. Burke and Johnson called once;\r\nbut no artist came to see him. He would have almost shot any painter who\r\ndared to do so. He had his tea boiled in a quart pot, dined in Porridge\r\nIsland, and took milk for supper.[187]\r\n\r\nYears after Barry lay in state in the great room which his own genius had\r\nadorned, and was buried in the Abbey; but few of the Academicians attended\r\nhis funeral. The Adelphi pictures have been recently lined and restored.\r\n\r\nBarry having vainly attempted to decorate St. Paul’s, executed the\r\npaintings now at the Society of Arts for his mere expenses, but\r\neventually, one way and another, cleared a considerable sum by them. He\r\npainted them, as he said, to prove that Englishmen had a genius for high\r\nart, music, and other refinements of life. They are fairly drawn, often\r\nelegantly and reasonably well grouped, but bad in colour. The\r\nheterogeneous dresses are jumbled together with bad taste--Dr. Burney in a\r\ntoupee floats among water-nymphs, and William Penn’s wig and hat are\r\nludicrously obtrusive. The perspective is often “out,” and the attitudes\r\nare stiff; still, historically speaking, the pictures are large-minded and\r\ninteresting; and, in spite of his faults, one likes to think of the brave\r\nIrishman busy on his scaffold, railing at Reynolds and defying everybody.\r\nBarry was really a self-deceiver, like Haydon, and aimed far beyond his\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nAt Osborne’s Hotel, in John Street, the King and Queen of the Sandwich\r\nIslands resided while on a visit to England in the reign of George IV. A\r\ncomic song written on their arrival was once popular, though now\r\nforgotten; and Theodore Hook produced a quaint epigram on their death by\r\nsmall-pox, the point of which was, that one day Death, being hungry,\r\ncalled for “two Sandwiches.” The epigram was not without the unfeeling wit\r\npeculiar to that heartless lounger at the clubs, who spent his life\r\namusing the great people, and who died at last a worn-out spendthrift,\r\n_sans_ character, _sans_ everything.\r\n\r\nOf all London’s charlatans, perhaps the most impudent was Dr. Graham, a\r\nScotchman, whose brother married Catherine Macaulay, the author of a\r\nforgotten History of England, much vaunted by Horace Walpole. In or about\r\n1780 this plausible cheat opened what he called a “Temple of Health,” in a\r\ncentral house in the Adelphi Terrace. His rooms were stuffed with glass\r\nglobes, marble statues, medico-electric apparatus, figures of dragons,\r\nstained glass, and other theatrical properties. The air was drugged with\r\nincense and strains of music. The priestess of this temple was said to be\r\nno less a person than Emma Lyons, afterwards Lady Hamilton, the fatal\r\nCleopatra of Lord Nelson. She had been first a housemaid and afterwards a\r\npainter’s model. She was as beautiful as she was vulgar and abandoned. The\r\nhouse was hung with crutches, ear-trumpets, and other trophies.[188] For\r\none night in the celestial bed, that secured a beautiful progeny, this\r\nimpostor obtained £100; for a supply of his elixir of life £1000 in\r\nadvance, and for his earth-baths a guinea each. Yet this arrant knave and\r\nhypocrite was patronised by half the English nobility. Archenholz, a\r\nGerman traveller, writing about 1784, describes Dr. Graham and his £60,000\r\ncelestial bed. He dilates on the vari-coloured transparent glasses, and\r\nthe rich vases of perfume that filled the impudent quack’s temple, the\r\nhalf-guinea treatises on health, the _moonshine_ admitted into the rooms,\r\nand the divine balm at a guinea a bottle.\r\n\r\nA magneto-electric bed, to be slept in for the small sum of £50 a night,\r\nwas on the second floor, on the right hand of the orchestra, and near the\r\nhermitage. Electricity and perfumes were laid on in glass tubes from\r\nadjoining reservoirs. The beds (there were two or three at least) rested\r\non six massy transparent columns. The perfumed curtains were of purple and\r\ncelestial blue, like those of the Grand Turk. Graham was blasphemous\r\nenough to call this chamber his “Holy of Holies.” His chief customers were\r\ncaptains of privateers, nabobs, spendthrifts, and old noblemen. The farce\r\nconcluded in March 1784, when the rooms were shut for ever, and the temple\r\nof Apollo, the immense electrical machine, the self-playing organ, and the\r\ncelestial bed, were sold in open daylight by a ruthless auctioneer.[189]\r\n\r\nBannister “took off” Graham in a farce called _The Genius of Nonsense_,\r\nproduced at the Haymarket in 1780. His satin sofas on glass legs, his\r\ncelestial bed, his two porters in long tawdry greatcoats and immense\r\ngold-laced cocked hats, distributing handbills at the door, while his\r\ngoddess of health was dying of a sore-throat from squalling songs at the\r\ntop of the staircase, were all hit off by a speaking harlequin, who also\r\ncaricatured the doctor’s sliding walk and bobbing bows. The younger Colman\r\nand Bannister had been to the Temple of Health on purpose to take the\r\nquack’s portrait.[190]\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Hill, the fussy, good-natured Hull of Theodore Hook’s _Gilbert\r\nGurney_, lived for many years and finally died in the second floor of No.\r\n1 James Street, Adelphi. He was the supposed prototype of the obtrusive\r\nPaul Pry. It was Hill’s boast always to have what you wanted. “Cards, sir?\r\nPooh! pooh! Nonsense! thousands of packs in the house.” Liston made the\r\nname of Paul Pry proverbial and world-wide.\r\n\r\nThe names of the four Scotch brothers, John, Robert, James, and William\r\nAdam, are preserved by the existing Adelphi Streets. When will any of our\r\nstreets be named after great thinkers? It is a disgrace to us to allow new\r\ndistricts to be christened, without Government supervision, by worthless,\r\nignoble, and ridiculous names, confusing in their vulgar repetition.\r\nIndifferent kings, and nobles not much better, give their names to half\r\nthe suburbs of London, while Shakespere is unremembered by the builders,\r\nand Spenser and Byron have as yet no brick-and-mortar godchildren.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD HOUSES ON THE SITE OF WELLINGTON STREET, 1742.]\r\n\r\nThe eldest of the brothers, Robert Adam, died in 1792, and was buried in\r\nthe south aisle of Westminster Abbey. His pall was supported by the Duke\r\nof Buccleuch, the Earl of Coventry, the Earl of Lauderdale, Lord Stormont,\r\nLord Frederick Campbell, and Mr. Pulteney.\r\n\r\nIt was told as a joke invented against that fat butt, Sir William Curtis,\r\nthat at a public dinner some lover of royalty and Terence proposed the\r\nhealths of George IV. and the Duke of York as “the Adelphi,” upon which\r\nthe alderman, who followed with the next toast, determining that the East\r\nshould not be far behind the West, rose and said that “as they were now on\r\nthe subject of streets, he would beg to propose Finsbury Square.” But,\r\nafter all, why should we laugh at the poor alderman because he did not\r\nhappen to know Greek? That surely is a venial sin.\r\n\r\nAnd here, retracing our steps, we must make an episode and turn back down\r\nthe Savoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SAVOY FROM THE THAMES, 1650.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE SAVOY.\r\n\r\n    “Their leaders, John Ball, Jack Straw, and Wat Tyler, then marched\r\n    through London, attended by more than twenty thousand men, to the\r\n    PALACE OF THE SAVOY, which is a handsome building on the road to\r\n    Westminster, situated on the banks of the Thames, and belonging to the\r\n    Duke of Lancaster. They immediately killed the porters, pressed into\r\n    the house, and set it on fire.”--_Froissart’s Chronicles._\r\n\r\n\r\nA minute’s walk down a turning on the south side of the Strand, and we are\r\nin the precinct of an old palace, and standing on royal property.\r\n\r\nIn a ramble by moonlight one cannot fail to meet under the churchyard\r\ntrees in the Savoy, John of Gaunt, who once lived there; John, King of\r\nFrance, who died there; George Wither, the poet, and sweet Mistress Anne\r\nKilligrew, who are buried there, and Chaucer, who was married there.\r\n\r\nDown that steep, dray-traversed street, now so dull and lonely, kings and\r\nbishops, knights and ladies, have paced, and mobs have hurried with sword\r\nand fire. Now it is a congeries of pickle warehouses, printing offices,\r\nand glass manufactories.\r\n\r\nSimon de Montfort, that ambitious Earl of Leicester who married the sister\r\nof Henry III., and whose father persecuted the Albigenses, dwelt in the\r\nSavoy. Here he must have first won the barons, the people, and the humbler\r\nclergy by his opposition to the extortions of the king and the bishops.\r\nHere for a time he must have all but reigned, till that fatal August day\r\nwhen he fell at Evesham. Simon was a friend of the monks, and after his\r\ndeath endless miracles were said to have been wrought at his grave,[191]\r\nas might have been expected.\r\n\r\nThe Savoy derives its foreign name from a certain Peter, Earl of Savoy,\r\nuncle of Eleanor, the daughter of Raymond, Count of Provence, and queen of\r\nthat good man, but weak monarch, Henry III. This earl was the leader of\r\nthat rapacious and insolent train of Frenchmen and Savoyards which\r\nfollowed Queen Eleanor to England, and drove Simon de Montfort and his\r\nimpetuous barons to rebellion by their hunger for titles, lands, and\r\nbenefices. In 30 Henry III. the king granted to Peter, Earl of Richmond\r\nand Savoy, all those houses in the Strand, adjoining the river, formerly\r\nbelonging to Brian de Lisle, upon paying yearly to the king’s exchequer,\r\nat the Feast of St. Michael, three barbed arrows for all services.\r\n\r\nIn 1322 an Earl of Lancaster, then master of the Savoy, on the return of\r\nthe Spensers, formed an alliance with the Scots, and broke out into open\r\nrebellion against Edward II. He was taken at Boroughbridge, led to\r\nPontefract, and there beheaded. As he was led to execution on a bridleless\r\npony, the mob pelted him with mud, taunting him as King Arthur--the royal\r\nname he had assumed in his treasonable letters to the Scots.[192]\r\n\r\nEarl Peter, in due time growing weary of stormy England, and sighing for\r\nhis cool Savoy mountains, transferred his mansion to the provost and\r\nchapter of Montjoy (Fratres de Monte Jovis) at Havering-atte-Bower, a\r\nsmall village in Essex. At the death of the foolish king, his widow\r\npurchased the palace of the Savoy of the Montjoy chapter, as a residence\r\nfor her son Edmund, afterwards Earl of Lancaster, to whom had been given\r\nthe chief estates of the defeated Montfort.\r\n\r\nHis son Henry, Duke of Lancaster, repaired and partly rebuilt the palace,\r\nat an expense of upwards of 50,000 marks. From this potent lord it\r\ndescended to Edward III.’s son, John of Gaunt (Ghent), who lived here in\r\nthe splendour befitting the son of Edward III., the uncle of Richard II.,\r\nand the father of a prince hereafter to become Henry IV.\r\n\r\nIt was in the chapel of this river-side palace (about 1360, Edward III.)\r\nthat our great poet, Geoffrey Chaucer, married Philippa, daughter of a\r\nknight of Hainault and sister to a mistress of the Duke’s. He mentions his\r\nmarriage in his poem of _The Dream_.[193] He says harmoniously--\r\n\r\n            “On the morrow,\r\n  When every thought and every sorrow\r\n  Dislodg’d was out of mine heart,\r\n  With every woe and every smart,\r\n  Unto a tent prince and princess\r\n  Methought brought me and my mistress.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  With ladies, knighten, and squiers,\r\n  And a great host of ministers,\r\n  Which tent was church parochial.”\r\n\r\nThose marriage bells have long since rung, the smoke of that incense has\r\nlong since risen to heaven, yet we seldom pass the Savoy without thinking\r\nhow the poet and his fair Philippa went\r\n\r\n          “To holy church’s ordinance,\r\n  And after that to dine and dance,\r\n              ... and divers plays.”\r\n\r\nIt was to his great patron--“time-honoured” Lancaster, claimant, through\r\nhis wife, of the throne of Castile--that Chaucer owed all his court\r\nfavours, his Genoese embassy, his daily pitcher of wine, his wardship, his\r\ncontrollership, and his annuity of twenty marks. It was in this palace he\r\nmust have imbibed his attachment to Wickliffe, and his hatred of all proud\r\nand hypocritical priests.\r\n\r\nBuildings seem, like men, to be born under special stars. It was the fate\r\nof the Savoy to enjoy a hundred and forty years of splendour, and then to\r\nsink into changeless poverty and desolation. It was also its ill fate to\r\nbe once sacked and once burnt. In 1378, under Richard II., its first\r\npunishment overtook it. John Wickliffe, a Yorkshireman, had been appointed\r\nrector of Lutterworth, in Leicestershire, by the favour of John of Ghent,\r\nwho was delighted with a speech of Wickliffe in Parliament denying that\r\nKing John’s tribute to the Pope necessarily bound King Edward III. The\r\nPapal bull for Wickliffe’s prosecution did not reach England till the\r\nking’s death, but Wickliffe was cited on the 19th of February, 1378, to\r\nappear before the Bishop of London at St. Paul’s. In the interval before\r\nhis appearance he had promised the Parliament, at their request, to prove\r\nthe legality of its refusal to pay tribute to the Pope.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed Wickliffe appeared in Our Lady’s Chapel, accompanied\r\nby the Earl Marshall, Percy, and the Duke of Lancaster, who openly\r\nencouraged him, to the horror of the populace and the bitter rage of the\r\npriests. A quarrel instantly began by Courtenay, the Bishop of London,\r\nopposing a motion of the Earl Marshall that Wickliffe should be allowed a\r\nseat. The proud duke, pale with anger, whispered fiercely to the bishop\r\nthat, “rather than take such language from him, he would drag him out of\r\nthe church by the hair of his head.” The threat was heard by an unfriendly\r\nbystander, and it passed round the church in whispers. Rumour, with her\r\nthousand babbling tongues, was soon busy in the churchyard, where the\r\npeople had assembled, eager for the reformer’s condemnation. They\r\ninstantly broke forth like hounds which have recovered a scent. It was at\r\nonce proposed to break into the church and pull the duke from the\r\njudgment-seat. When he appeared at the door, he was received with ominous\r\nyells, and was chased and pelted by the mob. Furious and beside himself\r\nwith rage, he instantly proceeded to Westminster, where the Parliament was\r\nsitting, and moved that from that day forth all the privileges of the\r\ncitizens of London should be annulled, that they should no longer elect a\r\nmayor or sheriff, and that Lord Percy should possess the entire\r\njurisdiction over them--a severe penalty, it must be owned, for pelting a\r\nduke with mud.\r\n\r\nThe following day, the citizens, hearing of this insolent proposal,\r\nsnatched up their arms, and swore to take the proud duke’s life. After\r\npillaging the Marshalsea, where Lord Percy resided, they poured down on\r\nthe Savoy and killed a priest whom they took to be Percy in disguise. They\r\nthen broke all the furniture and threw it into the Thames, leaving only\r\nthe bare walls standing. While the mob were shouting at the windows,\r\nfeeding the river with torrents of spoiled wealth, or cutting the beds and\r\ntapestry to pieces, the duke and Lord Percy, who had been dining with John\r\nof Ypres, a merchant in the City, escaped in disguise by rowing up the\r\nriver to Kingston in an open boat. Eventually, at the entreaties of the\r\nBishop of London, who pleaded the sanctity of Lent, the rioters dispersed,\r\nhaving first hung up the duke’s arms in a public place as those of a\r\ntraitor. The Londoners finally appeased their opponent by carrying to St.\r\nPaul’s a huge taper of wax, blazoned with the duke’s arms, which was to\r\nburn continually before the image of Our Lady in token of reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThis John of Gaunt, fourth son[194] of Edward III., married Blanche,\r\ndaughter of Henry, Duke of Lancaster, who died of the plague in 1360, John\r\nsucceeding to the title in right of his wife. He married his daughter\r\nPhilippa to the King of Portugal, and his daughter Catharine to the Infant\r\nof Spain. From Henry Plantagenet, fourth Earl and first Duke of\r\nLancaster, the Savoy descended to this John of Ghent, who married that\r\namiable princess, Blanche Plantagenet, daughter and co-heir of Earl Henry.\r\n\r\nInto this same king-haunted precinct John of France, after the slaughter\r\nat Poitiers, was brought with chivalrous and almost ostentatious humility\r\nby the Black Prince. One thousand nine hundred English lances had routed\r\nwith great slaughter eight thousand French. The lanes and moors of\r\nMaupertuis were choked with dead knights; the French king had been\r\nwounded, beaten to the ground, and taken prisoner, together with his son\r\nPhilip, by a gentleman of Artois.[195] Sailing from Bordeaux, the Black\r\nPrince arrived at Sandwich with his prisoner, and was received at\r\nSouthwark by the citizens of London on May 5, 1357. Triumphal arches were\r\nerected, and tapestry hung from every window. The King of France rode like\r\na conqueror on a richly trapped cream-coloured horse, while by his side\r\nsat the young prince on a small black palfrey. Some hours elapsed before\r\nthe procession could reach Westminster Hall, where King Edward was\r\nsurrounded by his prelates, knights, and barons. When John entered, our\r\nking arose, embraced him, and led him to a splendid banquet prepared for\r\nhim. The palace of the Savoy was allotted to King John and his son, till\r\nhis removal to Windsor.\r\n\r\nHere the royal Frenchman may have been when he heard the tidings of the\r\nferocity of the Jacquerie, and of the dreadful riots in his capital. To\r\nthe Savoy he returned when his son, the Duke of Anjou, broke his parole\r\nand fled to Paris, desirous to exculpate himself of this dishonour, and to\r\narrange for a crusade to recover Cyprus from the Turk.[196] To his\r\ncouncil, dissuading him from returning, like a second Regulus, to\r\ncaptivity and perhaps death, the king addressed these memorable words--“If\r\nhonour were banished from every other place, it should at least find an\r\nasylum in the breast of kings.”\r\n\r\nJohn was affectionately received by the chivalrous Edward, and again\r\nreturned to his old quarters in the Savoy, with his hostages of the blood\r\nroyal--“the three lords of the fleur-de-lys.” Here he spent several weeks\r\nin giving and receiving entertainments; but before he could proceed to\r\nbusiness, he was attacked with a dangerous illness, and expired in 1364.\r\nHis obsequies were performed with regal magnificence, and his corpse was\r\nsent with a splendid retinue to be interred at St. Denis.\r\n\r\nWhen treaties are broken by statesmen, or unjust wars declared, let the\r\nreader go to the Savoy, and think of that brave promise-keeper, King John\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years of King Edward III., John of Gaunt became very\r\nunpopular. “The good Parliament” (1376) remonstrated against the expense\r\nof his unsuccessful wars in Spain, Scotland, and France, and against the\r\nexcessive taxation. The duke imprisoned the Speaker, and banished wise\r\nWilliam of Wyckeham from the king’s person, but in vain attempted to alter\r\nthe law of succession.\r\n\r\nIn Wat Tyler’s rebellion the duke’s palace was the first to be destroyed.\r\nA refusal to pay oppressive poll-tax led to a riot at Fobbing, a village\r\nin Essex; from this place the flame spread like wildfire through the whole\r\ncounty, and the people rose, led by a priest named Jack Straw. At\r\nDartford, a tiler bravely beat out the brains of a tax-collector who had\r\ninsulted his daughter. Kent instantly rose, took Rochester Castle, and\r\nmassed together at Maidstone, under Wat, a tiler, and Ball, a preacher. In\r\na few days a hundred thousand men, rudely armed with clubs, bills, and\r\nbows, poured over Blackheath and hurried on to London.[197] In Southwark\r\nthey demolished the Marshalsea and the King’s Bench; then they sacked\r\nLambeth Palace, destroyed Newgate, fired the house of the Knights\r\nHospitallers at Clerkenwell, and that of the Knights of St. John at\r\nHighbury, and seizing the Tower, beheaded an archbishop and several\r\nknights. All Flemings hidden in churches were dragged out and put to\r\ndeath. Yet, with all this intoxication of new liberty, the claims of\r\nthese Kentish men were simple and just. They demanded--The abolition of\r\nslavery; the reduction of rent to fourpence an acre; the free liberty of\r\nbuying and selling in all fairs and markets; and lastly a general pardon.\r\n\r\nAt the great bivouacs at Mile End and on Tower Hill, Wat Tyler’s men\r\nrequired all recruits to swear to be true to King Richard and the Commons,\r\nand to admit no monarch of the name of John.[198] This last clause of the\r\noath was aimed at John of Gaunt, to whom the people attributed all their\r\nmisery. On June 13, 1381, a deluge of billmen, bowmen, artisans, and\r\nploughmen rolled down on the Savoy. The duke was at the time negotiating\r\nwith the Scots on the Borders, while his castles of Leicester and Tutbury\r\nwere being plundered. The attack was sudden, and there was no defence. A\r\nproclamation had previously been made by Wat Tyler, that, as the common\r\nobject was justice and not plunder, any one found stealing would be put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nFor beauty and stateliness of building, as well as all manner of princely\r\nfurniture, there was, says Holinshed, no palace in the realm comparable to\r\nthe duke’s house that the Kentish and Essex men burnt and marred. They\r\ntore the silken and velvet hangings; they beat up the gold and silver\r\nplate, and threw it into the Thames; they crushed the jewels and mortars,\r\nand poured the dust into the river. One of the men--unfortunate\r\nrogue!--being seen to slip a silver cup into the breast of his doublet,\r\nwas tossed into the fire and burnt to death, amid shouts and “fell\r\ncries.”[199] The cellars were ruthlessly plundered, probably in spite of\r\nWat Tyler, and thirty-two of the poor wretches, buried under beams and\r\nstones, were either starved or suffocated. In the wildest of the storm,\r\nsome barrels were at last found which were supposed to contain money. They\r\nwere flung into the huge bonfire; in an instant they exploded, blew up the\r\ngreat hall, shook down several houses, killed many men, and reduced the\r\npalace to ruins. That was on the 13th; on the 15th, the Essex men had\r\ndispersed; and Wat Tyler, the impetuous reformer, during a conference\r\nwith the king in Smithfield, was slain by a sudden blow from the sword of\r\nLord Mayor Walworth.\r\n\r\nJohn of Gaunt died at the Bishop of Ely’s palace in Holborn, at Christmas\r\n1398--his old home being now a ruin--and he was buried on the north side\r\nof the high altar of Saint Paul’s, beside the Lady Blanche, his first\r\nwife. Instantly on his death, the wilful young king, to the rage of the\r\npeople, seized on all his uncle’s lands, rents, and revenues, and banished\r\nthe duke’s attorney, who resisted his shameless theft. Amongst this pile\r\nof plunder the Savoy must have also passed.\r\n\r\nThe Savoy had bloomed, and after the bloom came in its due time the “sere\r\nand yellow leaf.” The precinct must have remained a waste during the Wars\r\nof the Roses;[200] but its blackened ruins preached their silent lesson in\r\nvain to the turbulent and tormented Londoners.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of that dark and wily king, Henry VII., sunshine again fell\r\non the Savoy. That prince, who was fond of erecting convents, founded on\r\nthe old site a hospital, intended to shelter one hundred poor almsmen. It\r\nwas not, however, finished when he died, nor was it completed till the\r\nfifteenth year of his son’s reign (1524), the year in which the French\r\nwere driven out of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe hospital, which was dedicated to John the Baptist, was in the form of\r\na cross, and over the entrance-gate, facing the Strand, was the following\r\ninsipid inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “_Hospitium hoc inopi turba Savoia vocatum,\r\n  Septimus Henricus solo fundavit ab imo._”\r\n\r\nThe master and four brethren were to be priests and to officiate in turns,\r\nstanding day and night at the gate to invite in and feed any poor or\r\ndistressed persons who passed down the river-side road. If those so\r\nreceived were pilgrims or travellers, they were to be dismissed the next\r\nmorning with a letter of recommendation to the next hospital, and with\r\nmoney to defray their expenses on the journey.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward VI., part of the revenues of the new hospital, to\r\nthe value of six hundred pounds, was transferred to Bridewell prison and\r\nChrist’s Hospital school for poor orphan children; for already abuses had\r\ncrept in, and indiscriminate charity had led to its usual melancholy\r\nresults. The old palace had become no mere shelter for the deserving poor,\r\nbut a den of loiterers, sham cripples, and vagabonds of either sex, who\r\nbegged all day in the fields and came to the Savoy to sleep and sup.[201]\r\n\r\nQueen Mary, whose Spanish blood made her a friend to all monastic\r\ninstitutions, re-endowed the unlucky place with fresh lands; but it went\r\non in its old courses till the twelfth year of Elizabeth, who suddenly\r\npounced in her own stern way on the nest of rogues, and, to the terror of\r\nsinecurists, deprived Thomas Thurland, then master, of his office, for\r\ncorruption and embezzlement of the hospital estates.\r\n\r\nWe hear nothing more of the unlucky and neglected Hospital of St. John\r\ntill the Restoration, when Dr. Henry Killigrew was appointed master, much\r\nto the chagrin and disappointment of the poet Cowley, to whom the sinecure\r\nhad been promised by Charles I. and Charles II.\r\n\r\nCowley, the clever son of a London stationer, had been secretary to the\r\nqueen-mother, but returning as a spy to England, was apprehended, and upon\r\nthat made his peace with Cromwell. This latter fact the Royalists never\r\nforgave, and considering his play of _The Cutter of Colman Street_ as\r\ncaricaturing the old roystering Cavalier officers, they damned his comedy,\r\nlampooned him, and gave the Savoy to Killigrew, father of the court wit.\r\nUpon this the mortified poet wrote his poem of “The Complaint,”[202]\r\nwherein he calls the Savoy the Rachel he had served with “faith and labour\r\nfor twice seven years and more,” and querulously describes himself as left\r\nalone gasping on the naked beach, while all his fellow voyagers had\r\nmarched up to possess the promised land. The poem, though ludicrously\r\nquerulous, contains some lines, such as the following, which are truly\r\nbeautiful. The muse is reproaching the truant poet.\r\n\r\n  “Art thou returned at last,” said she,\r\n  “To this forsaken place and me,\r\n  Thou prodigal who didst so loosely waste,\r\n  Of all thy youthful years, the good estate?\r\n  Art thou return’d here to repent too late,\r\n  And gather husks of learning up at last,\r\n  Now the rich harvest-time of life is past,\r\n  And winter marches on so fast?”\r\n\r\nWith this farewell lament Cowley withdrew “from the tumult and business of\r\nthe world,” to his long-coveted retirement[203] at pleasant, green\r\nChertsey, where, seven years after, he died.\r\n\r\nThe Savoy, always an abused sinecure, that made the master a rogue and its\r\ninmates professional beggars, was finally suppressed in the reign of Queen\r\nAnne.[204] It was then used as a barrack for five hundred soldiers, and as\r\na deserters’ prison, till the approaches to Waterloo Bridge rendered its\r\nremoval necessary.\r\n\r\nSavoy Street occupies the site of the old central Henry VII.’s Tudor gate.\r\nCoal wharves cover the site of the ancient front of the hospital, and the\r\nhouses in Lancaster Place, leading to Waterloo Bridge, another part of its\r\narea.\r\n\r\nIn 1661, the year after the restoration of Charles II., a celebrated\r\nconference between the Church of England bishops and the Presbyterian\r\ndivines took place, with very small result, in the Bishop of London’s\r\nlodgings in the Savoy. Among the twelve bishops were Sheldon and Gauden,\r\nthe author of _Ikon Basilike_: among the Presbyterians Baxter, Calamy, and\r\nReynolds. They were to revise the Liturgy, and to discuss rules and forms\r\nof prayer; but there was so much distrust and reserve on both sides, that\r\nat the end of two months the conference came to an untimely end.[205] It\r\nwas the bishops’ hour of triumph, and no concessions could be expected\r\nfrom them after their many mortifications. In the same year Charles II.\r\nestablished a French church in the Savoy, and Dr. Durel preached the first\r\nsermon to the foreign residents in London, July 14, 1661.[206]\r\n\r\nIn Queen Anne’s time, after its suppression, the Savoy became, like the\r\nClink and Whitefriars, a sanctuary for fraudulent debtors. On one\r\noccasion, in 1696, a creditor entering that nest of thieves to demand a\r\ndebt, was tarred and feathered, carried in a wheelbarrow into the Strand,\r\nand there bound to the May-pole; but some constables coming up dispersed\r\nthe rabble and rescued the tormented man from his persecutors.[207]\r\n\r\nStrype, writing about 1720 (George I.), describes the Savoy as a great\r\nruinous building, divided into several apartments. In one a cooper stored\r\nhis hoops and butts; in another there were rooms for deserters, pressed\r\nmen, Dutch recruits, and military prisoners. Within the precinct there was\r\nthe king’s printing-press, where gazettes, proclamations, and Acts of\r\nParliament were printed; and also a German Lutheran church, a French\r\nProtestant church, and a Dissenting chapel; besides “harbours for refugees\r\nand poor people.”[208] The worthy writer thus describes the hall of the\r\nold hospital:--\r\n\r\n“In the midst of its buildings is a very spacious hall, the walls three\r\nfoot broad, of stone without and brick and stone inward. The ceiling is\r\nvery curiously built with wood, having knobs in one place hanging down,\r\nand images of angels holding before their breasts coats of arms, but\r\nhardly discoverable. One is a cross gules between four stars, or else\r\nmullets. It is covered with lead, but in divers places open to the\r\nweather. Towards the east end of the hall is a fair cupola with glass\r\nwindows, but all broken, which makes it probable the hall was as long\r\nagain, since cupolas are wont to be built about the middle of great\r\nhalls.”\r\n\r\nIn 1754 (George II.) clandestine marriages were performed at the Savoy\r\nchurch; and the advantages of secrecy, privacy, and access by water were\r\nboldly advertised in the papers of the day. The _Public Advertiser_ of\r\nJanuary 2, 1754, contains the following impudent and touting\r\nadvertisement:--\r\n\r\n“BY AUTHORITY.--Marriages performed with the utmost privacy, secrecy, and\r\nregularity, at the ancient royal chapel of St. John the Baptist in the\r\nSavoy, where regular and authentic registers have been kept from the time\r\nof the Reformation (being two hundred years and upwards) to this day. The\r\nexpense not more than one guinea, the five shilling stamp included. There\r\nare five private ways by land to this chapel, and two by water.”\r\n\r\nAt this time the Savoy was still a large cruciform building, with two rows\r\nof mullioned windows facing the Thames; a court to the north of it was\r\ncalled the Friary. The north front, the most ornamented, had large pointed\r\nwindows and embattled parapets, lozenged with flint.\r\n\r\nAt the west end, in 1816, stood the guard-house, or military prison, its\r\ngateway secured by a strong buttress, and embellished with Henry VII.’s\r\narms and the badges of the rose and the portcullis: above these were two\r\nhexagonal oriel windows.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, when the ruins were to be removed, crowds thronged to see the\r\nremains of John of Gaunt’s old palace.[209] The workmen found it difficult\r\nto destroy the mossy and ivy-covered walls and the large north window; the\r\nmasses of flint, stone, and brick being eight or ten feet thick. The\r\nscrew-jack was powerless to destroy the work of Chaucer’s time. The masons\r\nhad to dig, pickaxe holes, and loosen the foundations, then to drive\r\ncrowbars into the windows and fasten ropes to them, so as to pull the\r\nstones inwards. The outer buttresses would in any other way have defied\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nSome of the stone was soft and white. This, according to tradition, was\r\nthat brought from Caen by Queen Mary. The industrious costermongers\r\ndiscovered this, and cut it into blocks to sell as hearthstones. A fire\r\nabout 1777 had thrown down much of the hospital, so that the old level was\r\nfifteen or twenty feet deeper. The vaults and subterranean passages were\r\nunexplored. The wells were filled up. The workmen then pulled down the\r\nGerman chapel, which stood next Somerset House, and the red-brick house in\r\nthe Savoy Square that was used for barracks. “The entrance,” says a writer\r\nof 1816, “to the Strand or Waterloo Bridge will be spacious, and the\r\nhouses in the Strand now only stop the opening.”[210]\r\n\r\nThe Chapel of St. Mary, Savoy, is a late and plain Perpendicular\r\nstructure, with a fine coloured ceiling. This small, quiet chapel holds a\r\nsilent congregation of illustrious dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SAVOY CHAPEL.]\r\n\r\nHere are interred Sir Robert and Lady Douglas (temp. James I.); the\r\nCountess of Dalhousie, daughter of Sir Allen Apsley, Lieutenant of the\r\nTower, and sister to that admirable wife, Mrs. Hutchinson, who died in\r\n1663; William Chaworth, who died in 1582, a member of that Nottinghamshire\r\nfamily, one of whom, Lord Byron’s predecessor, killed in a tavern duel;\r\nand Mrs. Anne Killigrew, who died in 1685, the paintress and poetess on\r\nwhom Dryden wrote an extravagant but glorious ode, beginning--\r\n\r\n  “That youngest virgin daughter of the skies,\r\n  Made in the last promotion of the blest.”[211]\r\n\r\nThis accomplished young lady was daughter of Dr. Henry Killigrew, and\r\nniece of Thomas Killigrew the wit, of whom Denham, the poet, bitterly\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n  “Had Cowley ne’er spoke, Killigrew ne’er writ,\r\n  Combined in one they’d made a matchless wit.”\r\n\r\nThe father of Mistress Killigrew was author of a tragedy called _The\r\nConspiracy_, which both Ben Jonson and Lord Falkland eulogised. Even old\r\nAnthony Wood says, in his own quaint way, that this lady “was a Grace for\r\nbeauty, and a Muse for wit.”[212]\r\n\r\nWe must add to this list Sir Richard and Lady Rokeby, who died in 1523,\r\nand Gawin Douglas, that good Bishop of Dunkeld who first translated Virgil\r\ninto Lowland Scotch. He was pensioned by Henry VIII., was a friend of\r\nPolydore Virgil, and died of the plague in London in 1521. The brass is on\r\nthe floor, about three feet south of the stove in the centre of the\r\nchapel.[213]\r\n\r\nDr. Cameron, the last victim executed for the daring rebellion of 1745,\r\nlies here also in good company among knights and bishops. His monument, by\r\nM. L. Watson, was not erected till 1846. Here, too, is that great admiral\r\nof Elizabeth--George, third Earl of Cumberland, who used to wear the glove\r\nwhich his queen had given him, set in diamonds, in his tilting helmet. He\r\ndied in the Duchy House in the Savoy, October 3, 1605; but his bowels\r\nalone were buried here, the rest of his body lies at Skipton. He was the\r\nfather of the brave, proud Countess, who, when Charles II.’s secretary\r\npressed on her notice a candidate for Appleby, wrote that celebrated\r\ncannon-shot of a letter:--\r\n\r\n    “I have been bullied by an usurper; I have been neglected by a court,\r\n    but I will not be dictated to by a subject. Your man shan’t stand.\r\n\r\n      “ANNE, DORSET, PEMBROKE, AND MONTGOMERY.”\r\n\r\nHere also there is a tablet to the memory of Richard Lander, the\r\ntraveller, originally a servant of that energetic discoverer Captain\r\nClapperton, who was the first to cross Africa from Tripoli and Benin.\r\nLander had the honour also of first discovering the course of the Niger.\r\nHe died in February 1834, from a gunshot-wound, at Fernando Po, aged only\r\nthirty-one. Such are the lion-men who extend the frontiers of English\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nIn the Savoy reposes a true poet, but an unhappy man--George Wither, the\r\nsatirist and idyllist, who died in 1667, and lies here between the east\r\ndoor and the south end of the chapel.[214] He was one of Cromwell’s\r\nmajor-generals, and had a hard time of it after the Restoration. It was to\r\nsave Wither’s life that Denham used that humorous petition--“As long as\r\nWither lives I should not be considered the worst poet in England.”\r\n\r\nWither anticipated Wordsworth in simple earnestness and a regard for the\r\nhumblest subjects. The soldier-poet himself says--\r\n\r\n  “In my former days of bliss,\r\n  Her divine skill taught me this:\r\n  That from everything I saw\r\n  I could some invention draw,\r\n  And raise pleasure to her height\r\n  Through the meanest object’s sight,\r\n  By the murmur of a spring,\r\n  By the least bough’s rustling.”[215]\r\n\r\nThese charming lines were written when Wither lay in the Marshalsea,\r\nimprisoned for writing a satire--_Abuses stripped and whipped_.\r\n\r\nIn the same church lies one of the smallest of military heroes--Lewis de\r\nDuras, Earl of Feversham, who died in the reign of Queen Anne. He was\r\nnephew of the great Turenne, and was one of the few persons present when\r\nCharles II. received extreme unction. He commanded, or rather followed,\r\nKing James II.’s troops at Sedgemoor, in 1685, and at that momentous\r\ncrisis “thought only of eating and sleeping.”[216] Upon this shambling\r\ngeneral the Duke of Buckingham wrote one of his latest lampoons.[217]\r\n\r\nIn 1552 the first manufactory of glass in England was established at the\r\nold Savoy House. It was here that, in 1658, the Independents met and drew\r\nup their famous Declaration of Faith. In 1671 the Royal Society’s\r\npublications were printed here. In Dryden’s time, the wounded English\r\nsailors who had been mangled by Van Tromp’s and De Ruyter’s shot were\r\nnursed here. The good and witty Fuller, who wrote the _Worthies_ lectured\r\nhere. Half-crazed Alexander Cruden, who compiled the laborious Concordance\r\nto the Bible, lived here; and here grinding Jacob Tonson had a warehouse.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the Queen repaired the Savoy Chapel, in virtue of her being the\r\npatron of it. The duty, indeed, fell upon the Crown, for the chapel stood\r\nin the Liberty of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the office of the Duchy is\r\nin Lancaster Place, to the right as you approach Waterloo Bridge.\r\n\r\nIn July 1864 the Savoy Chapel was unfortunately destroyed by a fire\r\noccasioned by an explosion of gas. The coloured ceiling, the altar window,\r\ncontaining a figure of St. John the Baptist, and a solitary niche with\r\nsome tabernacle work at the east end, all perished. It was shortly\r\nafterwards restored and decorated afresh throughout, at the cost of Her\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nMr. George Augustus Sala has admirably sketched the present condition of\r\nthe Precinct,--its almost solemn silence and its gravity,--its loneliness,\r\nas of Juan Fernandez, Norfolk Island, or Key West,[218] although on the\r\nvery verge of the roaring world of London, and but five minutes’ walk from\r\nTemple Bar.\r\n\r\nThe royal property is chiefly covered now by shops, public-houses, and\r\nprinting-offices. The Precinct still retains traditions of the vagabond\r\nsquatters who, till about the middle of the last century, assumed\r\npossession of the ruinous tenements in the Savoy, till the Footguards\r\nturned them out, and the houses were pulled down, rebuilt, and let to\r\nrespectable tenants.\r\n\r\nThe old churchyard has long since been sealed up by the Board of Health,\r\nbut the trees and grass still flourish round the old stones. Clean-shaved,\r\nnattily dressed actors come to this quiet purlieu to study their parts.\r\nMusicians of theatrical orchestras, penny-a-liners, and printers haunt the\r\nbar of the Savoy tavern. Those quiet houses with the white door-steps,\r\nshining brass plates and green blinds, are inhabited by accountants’\r\nclerks, retired and retiring small tradesmen, and commission agents\r\ninterested in pale ale, pickles, and Wallsend coals.\r\n\r\n“So,” says Mr. Sala, “run the sands of life through this quiet hour-glass;\r\nso glides the life away in the old Precinct. At its base a river runs for\r\nall the world; at its summit is the brawling, raging Strand; on either\r\nside are darkness and poverty and vice, the gloomy Adelphi arches, the\r\nBridge of Sighs that men call Waterloo. But the Precinct troubles itself\r\nlittle with the noise and tumult; it sleeps well through life without its\r\nfitful fever.”\r\n\r\nWearied of its old grandeur, pondering, as old men ponder, over its dead\r\nkings--for Wat Tyler and his Kentish men need no Riot Act to quiet them\r\nnow--the Savoy and its crowned ghosts drift on with our methodical planet,\r\nmeekly awaiting the death-blow that time must some day inflict.\r\n\r\nTait Wilkinson’s father was a minister of the Savoy. Garrick helped to\r\ntransport him by informing against him for illegally performing the\r\nmarriage ceremony. In return, Garrick helped forward the son--“an exotic,”\r\nas he called him, rather than an actor--but a wonderful mimic, not only of\r\nvoice and manner, but even of features. He used to reproduce Foote’s\r\nimitations of the older actors--as Mathews afterward imitated Wilkinson,\r\nwho in his time had imitated Foote, to that impudent buffoon’s great\r\nvexation.\r\n\r\nThe _Examiner_, whose office is near Waterloo Bridge, was started by Leigh\r\nHunt and his brother John in 1808. It began by boldly asserting the\r\nnecessity for reform, lampooning the Regent, and attacking the cant and\r\nexcesses of Methodism. In 1812 both the Hunts were found guilty of having\r\ncalled the Prince Regent “the Prince of Whales” and “a fat Adonis of\r\nfifty,” and were sentenced to two years’ imprisonment in Horsemonger Lane\r\ngaol, and to pay a fine of £500. At a later period, Hazlitt joined the\r\npaper, and wrote for it the essays reprinted (in 1817) under the title of\r\n_The Round Table_.[219] Close to it is the office of the _Spectator_,\r\nanother paper of the same calibre and class, and more important than the\r\n_Examiner_ now, though its early history is not so interesting.\r\n\r\nWaterloo Bridge, one of those marvels built by the industrious\r\nsimple-hearted John Rennie, was opened by the Prince Regent in 1817. Dupin\r\ndeclared it was a colossal monument worthy of Sesostris or the Cæsars; and\r\nwhat most struck Canova in England was that the foolish Chinese Bridge\r\nthen in St. James’s Park should be the production of the Government, while\r\nWaterloo Bridge was the result of mere private enterprise.[220] The bridge\r\ndid not settle more than a few inches after the centres were struck.\r\n\r\nThe project of erecting the Strand Bridge, as it was first called, was\r\nstarted by a company in 1809, a joint-stock-fever year. Rennie received\r\n£1000 a year for himself and assistants, or £7: 7s. a day, and expenses.\r\nThe bridge consists of nine arches, of 120 feet span, with piers 20 feet\r\nthick, the arches being plain semi-ellipses, with their crowns 30 feet\r\nabove high water. Over the points of each pier are placed Doric column\r\npilasters, after a design taken from the Temple of Segesta in Sicily. In\r\nthe construction of the bridge the chief features of Rennie’s management\r\nwere the following:--The employment of coffer-dams in founding the piers;\r\nnew methods of constructing, floating, and fixing the centres; the\r\nintroduction and working of Aberdeen granite to an extent before unknown;\r\nand the adoption of elliptical stone arches of an unusual width.\r\n\r\nNearly all the bur stone was brought to the bridge by one horse, called\r\n“Old Jack.” On one occasion the driver, a steady man, but too fond of his\r\nmorning dram, kept “Old Jack” waiting a longer time than usual at the\r\npublic-house, upon which he poked his head in at the open door, and gently\r\ndrew out his master by the coat collar.[221]\r\n\r\nRennie, the architect of the three great London bridges, the engineer of\r\nthe Plymouth Breakwater and of the London and East India Docks, and a\r\ndrainer of the Fens, was the son of a small farmer in East Lothian, and\r\nwas born in 1761.[222]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SAVOY PRISON, 1793.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DURHAM HOUSE, 1790.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE SAVOY TO CHARING CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld York House stood on the site of Buckingham and Villiers Streets. In\r\nancient times, York House had been the inn of the Bishops of Norwich.\r\nAbandoned to the crown, King Henry VIII. gave the place to that gay knight\r\nCharles Brandon, the husband of his beautiful sister Mary, the Queen of\r\nFrance. When the Church rose again and resumed its scarlet pomp, the house\r\nwas given to Queen Mary’s Lord Chancellor, Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of\r\nYork, in exchange for Suffolk House in Southwark, which was presented by\r\nQueen Mary to the see of York in recompense for York House, Whitehall,\r\ntaken from Wolsey by her father. On the fall of that minister, once more a\r\nchange took place, and the house passed to the Lord Keeper, Sir Nicholas\r\nBacon, who rented it of the see of York.\r\n\r\nIn this house the great Francis Bacon was born, on the 22d of January,\r\n1561. York House stood near the royal palace, from which it was parted by\r\nlanes and fields. Its courtyard and great gates opened to the street. The\r\nmain front, with its turrets and water stair, faced the river. The garden,\r\nfalling by an easy slope to the Thames, commanded a view as far south as\r\nthe Lollards’ Tower at Lambeth, as far east as London Bridge. “All the gay\r\nriver life[223] swept past the lawn, the salmon-fishers spreading their\r\nnets, the watermen paddling gallants to Bankside, and Shakspere’s theatre,\r\nthe city barges rowing past in procession, and the queen herself, with her\r\ntrain of lords and ladies, shooting by in her journeys from the Tower to\r\nWhitehall Stairs. From the lattice out of which he gazed, the child could\r\nsee over the palace roof the pinnacles and crosses of the old abbey.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Keeper Pickering died at York House in 1596, and Lord Chancellor\r\nEgerton in 1616 or 1617. In 1588 it is supposed the Earl of Essex tried to\r\nobtain the house, as Archbishop Sandys wrote to Burghley begging him to\r\nresist some such demand. Essex was in ward here for six months, fretting\r\nunder the care of Lord Keeper Egerton.\r\n\r\n“York House was the scene,” says a clever pleader for a great man’s good\r\nfame, “of Bacon’s gayest hours, and of his sharpest griefs--of his highest\r\nmagnificence, and of his profoundest prostration. In it his studious\r\nchildhood passed away. In it his father died. On going into France, to the\r\ncourt of Henry IV., he left it a lively, splendid home; on his return from\r\nthat country, he found it a house of misery and death. From its gates he\r\nwandered forth with his widowed mother into the world. Though it passed\r\ninto other hands, his connection with it never ceased. Under Egerton its\r\ngates again opened to him. It was the scene of that inquiry into the Irish\r\ntreason when he was the queen’s historian. During his courtship of Alice\r\nBarnham, York House was his second home. In one of its chambers he watched\r\nby the sick-bed of Ellesmere, and on Ellesmere’s surrender of the Seals,\r\npresented the dying Chancellor with the coronet of Brackley. It became his\r\nown during his reign as Keeper and Chancellor. From it he dated his great\r\nInstauration; in its banqueting-hall he feasted poets and scholars; from\r\none of its bed-rooms he wrote his Submission and Confession; in the same\r\nroom he received the Earls of Arundel, Pembroke, and Southampton, as\r\nmessengers from the House of Lords; there he surrendered the Great Seal.\r\nTo regain York House, when it had passed into other hands, was one of the\r\nwarmest passions of his heart, and the resolution to retain it against the\r\neager desires of Buckingham was one of the secret causes of his fall.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the fallen great man; “York House is the house wherein my\r\nfather died and wherein I first breathed, and there will I yield my last\r\nbreath, if it so please God, and the king will give me leave.”[224]\r\n\r\nSome of the saddest and some of the happiest events of Bacon’s life must\r\nhave happened in the Strand. From thence he rode, sumptuous in purple\r\nvelvet from cap to shoe, along the lanes to Marylebone Chapel, to wed his\r\nbride Alice Barnham.\r\n\r\nYork House was famous for its aviary, on which Bacon had expended £300. It\r\nwas in the garden here that we are told the Chancellor once stood looking\r\nat the fishers below throwing their nets. Bacon offered them so much for a\r\ndraught, but they refused. Up came the net with only two or three little\r\nfish; upon which his lordship told them that “hope was a good breakfast,\r\nbut an ill supper.”[225]\r\n\r\nIt was on the death of his friend, Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, and on his\r\nown installation, that Bacon bought the lease of York House from the\r\nformer’s son, the first Earl of Bridgewater. He found the rooms vast and\r\nnaked. His friends and votaries furnished the house, giving him books and\r\ndrawings, stands of arms, cabinets, jewels, rings, and boxes of money.\r\nLady Cæsar contributed a massive gold chain, and Prince Charles a diamond\r\nring.\r\n\r\nBacon, when young, had been often taken to court by his father; and the\r\nqueen, delighting in the gravity and wisdom of the boy, used to call him\r\nher “young Lord Keeper.” Even then his mind was philosophically observant;\r\nand it is said that he used to leave his playmates in St. James’s Fields\r\nto try and discover the cause of the echo in a certain brick conduit.[226]\r\n\r\nAt Durham House, on January 22, 1620, the year in which he published his\r\n_magnum opus_, the _Novum Organon_, and a twelvemonth before his disgrace,\r\nBacon gave a grand banquet to his friends. Ben Jonson was one of the\r\nguests, and is supposed to have himself recited a set of verses, in which\r\nhe says--\r\n\r\n  “Hail th’ happy genius of the ancient pile!\r\n  How comes it that all things so about thee smile,--\r\n  The fire, the wine, the men?--and in the midst\r\n  Thou stand’st as if some mystery thou didst.\r\n\r\n  “England’s High Chancellor, the destined heir,\r\n  In his soft cradle to his father’s chair,\r\n  Whose even thread the Fates spin round and full,\r\n  Out of their choicest and their richest wool.\r\n  ’Tis a brave cause of joy.        *        *\r\n  Give me a deep-crowned bowl, that I may sing,\r\n  In raising him, the wisdom of my king.”\r\n\r\nWho till he dies can boast of having been happy? The year after, the\r\nking’s anger fell like an axe upon the great courtier. Solitary and\r\ncomfortless at Gorhambury, Bacon petitioned the Lords in almost abject\r\nterms to be allowed to return to York House, where he could advance his\r\nstudies and consult his physicians, creditors, and friends, so that “out\r\nof the carcass of dead and rotten greatness, as out of Samson’s lion,\r\nthere may be honey gathered for future times.” Sir Edward Sackville prayed\r\nhim in vain to remove his straitest shackles by surrendering York House to\r\nthe king’s favourite; and so did his creditor, Mr. Meautys, who, says\r\nBacon, used him “coarsely,” and meant “to saw him asunder.” “The great\r\nlords,” says Meautys, “long to be in York House. I know your lordship\r\ncannot forget they have such a savage word among them as _fleecing_.” This\r\nword has grown tame in modern times, but it had a terrible significance in\r\nthose days, when it hinted at flaying.\r\n\r\nAn episode about Bacon’s younger days may be pardoned here. The Gray’s Inn\r\nChambers occupied by Bacon were in Coney Court, looking over the gardens\r\nand past St. Pancras Church to Hampstead Hill. They are no longer\r\nstanding. The site of them was No. 1 Gray’s Inn Square. Bacon began to\r\nkeep his terms at the age of eighteen, in June 1579. His uncle Burleigh\r\nwas bencher in this inn, and his cousins, Robert, Cecil, and Nicholas\r\nTrott, students. In his latter days, when Attorney-General, and even when\r\nLord Chancellor, he retained a lease of his old rooms in Coney Court. He\r\nwas called to the bar when he was twenty-one, in 1582; and as soon as he\r\nwas called he appeared in Fleet Street in his serge and bands, as a sign\r\nthat he was going to practise for his bread. At the close of his first\r\nsession, however, he was raised to the bench. Bacon always remained\r\nattached to Gray’s Inn; he laid out the gardens, planted the elm-trees,\r\nraised the terrace, pulled down and rebuilt the chambers, dressed the dumb\r\nshow, led off the dances, and invented the masques.[227]\r\n\r\nAfter Lord Bacon’s disgrace, the first Duke of Buckingham of the Villiers\r\nfamily borrowed the house from Toby Mathew, the courtly archbishop of\r\nYork, in hopes of a final exchange, which did eventually take place.[228]\r\nIn 1624, two years before Bacon’s death, a bill was passed to enable the\r\nking to exchange some lands for York House, so coveted by his proud\r\nfavourite. Buckingham soon partially pulled down the old mansion, and\r\nlined the walls of his temporary structure with huge mirrors. Here he\r\nentertained the foreign ambassadors. Of all his splendour, the only relic\r\nleft is the water gate usually ascribed to Inigo Jones.\r\n\r\nThis Duke of Buckingham, the “Steenie” of King James, and of Scott’s\r\n_Fortunes of Nigel_, was the younger son of a poor knight, who won James\r\nI. by his personal beauty, vivacity, and accomplishments--by his dancing,\r\njousting, leaping, and masquerading. At first page, cupbearer, and\r\ngentleman of the bedchamber, he rose to power on the disgrace of Carr.\r\n\r\nIt was at York House--“Yorschaux,” as he calls it, with the usual\r\ninsolence and carelessness of his nation--that Bassompierre visited the\r\nduke in 1626. He praises the mansion as more richly fitted up than any\r\nother he had ever seen.[229] Yet the duke did not live here, but at\r\nWallingford House, on the site of the Admiralty, keeping York House for\r\npageants and levees, till Felton’s knife severed his evil soul from his\r\nbody, August 23, 1628. His son, the Zimri of Dryden, was born at\r\nWallingford House.\r\n\r\nThe “superstitious pictures” at York House were sold in 1645,[230] and the\r\nhouse given by Cromwell to General Fairfax, whose daughter married the\r\nsecond and last Duke of Buckingham, of the Villiers line, the favourite of\r\nCharles II., the rival of Rochester, the plotter with Shaftesbury, the\r\nselfish profligate who drove Lee into Bedlam and starved Samuel Butler.\r\n\r\nIn 1661 the galleries of York House were famous for the antique busts and\r\nstatues that had belonged to Rubens on his visit to this country, when he\r\npainted James I. in jackboots being hauled heavenward by a flock of\r\nangels. In the riverside gardens--not far, I presume, from the water\r\ngate--stood John of Bologna’s “Cain and Abel,” which the King of Spain had\r\ngiven to Prince Charles on his luckless visit to Madrid, and which Charles\r\nhad bestowed on his dangerous favourite.[231]\r\n\r\nThe great rooms, even then emblazoned with the lions and peacocks of the\r\nVilliers and Manners families, were traversed by Evelyn, who describes the\r\nhouse and gardens as much ruined through neglect. Pepys also, who thrust\r\nhis nose into every show-place, went to York House when the Russian\r\nambassador was there, and rapturously and poetically vows he saw “the\r\nremains of the noble soul of the late Duke of Buckingham appearing in the\r\nhouse in every place, in the door-cases and the windows,”[232]--odd places\r\nfor a noble soul to make its abode!\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buckingham, in King Charles’s days, had turned York House into\r\na treasury of art. He bought Rubens’s private collection of pictures for\r\n£10,000, Sir Henry Wotten having purchased them for him at Venice. He had\r\nseventeen Tintorets, and thirteen works of Paul Veronese. For an “Ecce\r\nHomo” by Titian, containing nineteen figures as large as life, he refused\r\n£7000 from the Earl of Arundel. During the Civil Wars the pictures were\r\nremoved by his son to Antwerp, and there sold by auction.\r\n\r\nWho can look down Buckingham Street in the twilight, and see the pediment\r\nof the old water gate of the duke’s house, without repeating to himself\r\nthe scourging lines of Dryden when he drew Buckingham as Zimri?--\r\n\r\n  “A man so various that he seem’d to be\r\n  Not one but all mankind’s epitome;\r\n  Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong;\r\n  Was everything by turns, and nothing long;\r\n  But, in the course of one revolving moon,\r\n  Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon.”[233]\r\n\r\nIn vain Settle eulogised the mercurial and licentious spendthrift.\r\nSettle’s verse is forgotten, but we all remember Pope’s ghastly but\r\nexaggerated picture of the rake’s death in “the worst inn’s worst room”--\r\n\r\n  “No wit to flatter left of all his store,\r\n  No fool to laugh at, which he valued more,\r\n  There, victor of his health, of fortune, friends,\r\n  And fame, this lord of useless thousand ends.”\r\n\r\nThe first Duke of Buckingham, to judge by Clarendon, who was the friend of\r\nall friends of absolutism, must have been a man of magnificent generosity\r\nand “flowing courtesy,” a staunch friend, and a desperate and unrelenting\r\nhater; but he was an enemy of the people; and had he survived the knife of\r\nFelton he must have been the first of a faithless king’s bad counsellors\r\nto perish on the scaffold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WATER GATE, 1860.]\r\n\r\nThe second duke was a base-tempered, shameless profligate, a fickle,\r\ndishonest intriguer, who perished at last, a poor worn-out man, in a\r\nfarmer’s house in Yorkshire, from a cold caught while hunting. He was the\r\nauthor of several obscene lampoons, from which Swift took some hints; and\r\nhe was the godfather of a mock tragedy, _The Rehearsal_, in which he was\r\nhelped by Martin Clifford and Butler, the author of _Hudibras_, the latter\r\nof whom he left to starve. Baxter, it is true, drops a redeeming word or\r\ntwo on behalf of the gay scoundrel; but then Buckingham had intrigued with\r\nthe Puritans.\r\n\r\nYork Stairs, the only monument of Zimri’s splendour left, stand now in the\r\nmiddle of the gardens of the new Embankment. Till the Embankment was made,\r\nthe gate was approached by a small enclosed terrace planted with lime\r\ntrees. The water gate consists of a central archway and two side windows.\r\nFour rusticated columns support an arched pediment and two couchant lions\r\nholding shields. On a scroll are the Villiers arms. On the street side\r\nrise three arches, flanked by pilasters and an entablature, on which are\r\nfour stone globes. Above the keystone of the arches are shields and\r\nanchors. In the centre are the arms of Villiers impaling those of Manners.\r\nThe Villiers’ motto, _Fidei coticula crux_, “The cross is the whetstone of\r\nfaith,” is inscribed on the frieze. The gate, as it now stands, is\r\nridiculous, and is almost buried in the soil. It would be a charity to\r\nremove it to a water-side position.\r\n\r\nIn 1661, on the day of the great affray at the Tower Wharf between the\r\nretinues of the French and Spanish ambassadors, arising out of a dispute\r\nfor precedence, Pepys saw the latter return to York House in triumph,\r\nguarded with fifty drawn swords, having killed several Frenchmen. “It is\r\nstrange,” says the amusing quidnunc, “to see how all the city did rejoice,\r\nand, indeed, we do naturally all love the Spanish and hate the French.”\r\nWorthy man! the fact was, all time-servers were then agog about the queen\r\nwho was expected from Portugal. From York House Pepys went peering about\r\nthe French ambassador’s, and found his retainers all like dead men and\r\nshaking their heads. “There are no men in the world,” he says, “of a more\r\ninsolent spirit when they do well, and more abject if they miscarry, than\r\nthese people are.”[234]\r\n\r\nIn 1683 the learned and amiable John Evelyn, being then on the Board of\r\nTrade, took a house in Villiers Street for the winter, partly for business\r\npurposes, partly to educate his daughters.[235] Evelyn’s works gave a\r\nvaluable impetus to art and agriculture.\r\n\r\nAddison’s jovial friend, that delightful writer, Sir Richard Steele, lived\r\nin Villiers Street from 1721 to 1724, after the death of his wife, the\r\njealous “Prue.” Here he wrote his _Conscious Lovers_. The big,\r\nswarthy-faced ex-trooper, so contrasting with his grave and colder friend\r\nAddison, is a salient personage in the English Temple of Fame.\r\n\r\nDuke Street, built circa 1675,[236] was named from the last Duke of\r\nBuckingham. Humphrey Wanley, the great Harleian librarian, lived here, and\r\nthe son of Shadwell, the poet and Dryden’s enemy, who was an eminent\r\nphysician, and inherited much of his father’s excellent sense.\r\n\r\nIn 1672 the “chemyst, statesman, and buffoon” Duke of Buckingham sold York\r\nHouse and gardens for £30,000 to a brewer and woodmonger, who pulled it\r\ndown and laid out the present streets, naming them, with due respect to\r\nrank and wealth, even in a rascal, George Street, Villiers Street, Duke\r\nStreet, and Buckingham Street. In 1668 their rental was £1359: 10s.[237]\r\n\r\nIn Charles II.’s time waterworks were started at York Buildings by a\r\ncompany chartered to supply the West end with water, but they failed,\r\nbeing in advance of the time. The company, however, did not concentrate\r\nits energies on waterworks; it gave concerts, bought up forfeited estates\r\nin Scotland, and started many wild and eccentric projects, in some of\r\nwhich Steele figured prominently. The company has long been forgotten,\r\nthough kept in memory by a tall water tower, which was standing in the\r\nreign of George III.\r\n\r\nIn Buckingham Street, built in 1675, Samuel Pepys, the diarist, came to\r\nlive in 1684. The house, since rebuilt, was the last on the west side, and\r\nlooked on the Thames. It had been his friend Hewer’s before him. A view of\r\nthe library shows us the tall plain book-cases, and a central window\r\nlooking on the river. Pepys, the son of an army tailor, and as fond of\r\ndress and great people as might be expected of a tailor’s son, was for a\r\nlong time Secretary of the Admiralty under Charles II. He was President of\r\nthe Royal Society; and it is largely to his five folio books of ballads\r\nthat we owe Dr. Percy’s useful compilation, _The Relics of Ancient\r\nPoetry_. Pepys died in 1703, at the house of his friend Hewer, at Clapham.\r\n\r\nPepys’s house (No. 14) became afterwards, in the summer of 1824, the home\r\nof Etty, the painter, and remained so till within a few months of his\r\ndeath in 1849. Etty first took the ground floor (afterwards occupied by\r\nMr. Stanfield), then the top floor; the special object of his ambition\r\nbeing to watch sunsets over the river, which he loved as much as Turner\r\ndid, who frequently said, “There is finer scenery on its banks than on\r\nthose of any river in Italy.” Its ebb and flow, Etty used to declare, was\r\nlike life, and “the view from Lambeth to the Abbey not unlike Venice.” In\r\nthose river-side rooms the artists of two generations have\r\nassembled--Fuseli, Flaxman, Holland, Constable, and Hilton--then Turner,\r\nMaclise, Dyce, Herbert, and all the younger race. Etty’s rooms looked on\r\nto a terrace, with a small cottage at one end; the keeper once was a man\r\nnamed Hewson, supposed to be the original Strap of _Roderick Random_.[238]\r\nAn amiable, dreamy genius was the son of the miller and gingerbread-maker\r\nof York.\r\n\r\nThe witty Earl of Dorset lived in this street in 1681.\r\n\r\nOpposite Pepys’s house, and on the east side (left-hand corner), was a\r\nhouse where Peter the Great lodged when in England. Here, after rowing\r\nabout the Thames, watching the boat-building, or pulling to Deptford and\r\nback, this brave half-savage used to return and spend his rough evenings\r\nwith Lord Caermarthen, drinking a pint of hot brandy and pepper, after\r\nendless flasks of wine. It was certainly “brandy for heroes” in this case.\r\n\r\nLord Caermarthen was at this time Lord President of the Council, and had\r\nbeen appointed Peter’s cicerone by King William. The Russian czar was a\r\nhard drinker, and on one occasion is said to have drunk a pint of brandy,\r\na bottle of sherry, and eight flasks of sack, after which he calmly went\r\nto the play. While in York Buildings, the rough czar was so annoyed with\r\nthe vulgar curiosity of intrusive citizens, that he would sometimes rise\r\nfrom his dinner and leave the room in a rage. Here the Quakers forced\r\nthemselves upon him, and presented him with _Barclay’s Apology_, after\r\nwhich the czar attended their meeting in Gracechurch Street. He once asked\r\nthem of what use they were in any kingdom, since they would not bear arms.\r\nOn taking his farewell of King William, Peter drew a rough ruby, valued at\r\n£10,000, from his waistcoat pocket, and presented it to him screwed up in\r\nbrown paper.[239] He went back just in time to crush the Strelitzes,\r\nimprison his sister Sophia, and wage war on Charles XII. The great\r\nreformer was only twenty-six years old when he visited England.\r\n\r\nIn 1706 Robert Harley, Esq., afterwards Swift’s great patron and Earl of\r\nOxford, lived here;[240] and (1785) John Henderson, the actor, died in\r\nthis street.\r\n\r\nWalter, Lord Hungerford, of Farleigh Castle, Somerset, took the Duke of\r\nOrleans prisoner at Agincourt. He was Lord High Steward of Henry V. and\r\none of the executors to his will, and Lord High Treasurer in the reign of\r\nHenry VI. This illustrious noble was the son of Sir Thomas de Hungerforde,\r\nwho in 51 Edward III. was the first to take the chair as Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nHungerford Market covered the site of the seat of the Hungerford family.\r\nPepys mentions a fire at the house of old Lady Hungerford in Charles II.’s\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSir Edward (her husband), created a Knight of the Bath at the coronation\r\nof Charles II., pulled down the old mansion and divided it in 1680 into\r\nseveral houses, enclosing also a market-place. On the north side of the\r\nmarket-house was a bust of one of the family in a full-bottomed wig.[241]\r\nIt grew a disused and ill-favoured place before 1833. When a new market\r\n(Fowler, architect) was opened, it was intended to put an end to the\r\nmonopoly of Billingsgate. The old market had at first answered well for\r\nfruit and vegetables, as there was no need of porters from the water side;\r\nbut by 1720 Covent Garden had beaten it off.[242] It attempted too much in\r\nrivalling at once Leadenhall and Billingsgate, and failed--only a few\r\nfishmongers lingering on to the last.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 a suspension bridge, crossing from Hungerford to Lambeth (built\r\nunder Mr. I. K. Brunel’s supervision), was opened. It consisted of three\r\nspans, and two brick towers in the Italian style; the main span, at the\r\ntime of its erection, was larger than that of any other in the country,\r\nand only second to that of the bridge at Fribourg. It cost £110,000, and\r\nconsumed more than 10,000 tons of iron.[243]\r\n\r\nIn the same year the bridge was sold to the original proprietors for\r\n£226,000, but the purchase was never carried out. It was replaced in 1864\r\nby a railway bridge, and the market itself was filled up by an enormous\r\nrailway station. The market had sunk to zero years before. In 1850 some\r\nrogue of a speculator had opened in it a pretended exhibition of the\r\nsurplus articles rejected for want of room from the glass palace in Hyde\r\nPark. It proved a total failure, and swallowed up a vast sum of money and\r\na fine northern estate or two. Latterly it had become a gratuitous\r\nmusic-hall, a billiard-room, and a penny-ice house, conducted by an\r\nItalian.\r\n\r\nThe railway station, built by Mr. Barry, the son of the architect of the\r\nNew Houses of Parliament, faces the Strand. It is of a most creditable\r\ndesign, and the high Mansard roofs, which surmounted the hotel which forms\r\nits front, are of a freer and grander character than those of any modern\r\nLondon building. A model of the Eleanor Cross has been erected in the\r\ncourtyard in front of it. This building is one of the first omens of\r\nbetter things that we have yet seen in our still terribly mean and ugly\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nCraven Street was called Spur Alley till 1742.[244] Grinling Gibbons, the\r\ngreat wood-carver, born at Rotterdam, and whose genius John Evelyn\r\ndiscovered, lived here after leaving the Belle Sauvage Yard. Here he must\r\nhave fashioned those fragile strings of birds and fruit and flowers that\r\nadorn so many city churches, and the houses of so many English noblemen.\r\nAt No. 7, in 1775, lodged the great Benjamin Franklin, then no longer a\r\npoor printer, but the envoy of the American colonies. Here Lords Howe and\r\nStanhope visited him to propose terms from Lords Camden and Chatham, but\r\nunfortunately only in vain.[245] That weak and unfortunate man, the Rev.\r\nMr. Hackman, who shot Miss Ray, the actress and the mistress of Lord\r\nSandwich, who had encouraged his suit, lived in this street.\r\n\r\nJames Smith, one of the authors of the _Rejected Addresses_,--a series of\r\nparodies rivalled only by those of _Bon Gaultier_, lived at No. 27. It was\r\non his own street that he wrote the well-known epigram--[246]\r\n\r\n  “In Craven Street, Strand, the attorneys find place,\r\n  And ten dark coal barges are moor’d at its base.\r\n  Fly, Honesty, fly! seek some safer retreat:\r\n  There’s _craft_ in the river and _craft_ in the street.”\r\n\r\nBut Sir George Rose capped this in return, retorting in extemporaneous\r\nlines, written after dinner:--\r\n\r\n  “Why should Honesty fly to some safer retreat,\r\n    From attorneys and barges?--’od rot ’em!\r\n  For the lawyers are _just_ at the top of the street,\r\n    And the barges are _just_ at the bottom.”\r\n\r\nJames Smith, the intellectual hero of this street, the son of a solicitor\r\nto the Ordnance, was born in 1775. In 1802 he joined the staff of the\r\n_Pic-Nic_ newspaper, with Combe, Croker, Cumberland, and that mediocre\r\npoet, Sir James Bland Burgess. It changed its name to the _Cabinet_, and\r\ndied in 1803. From 1807 to 1817 James Smith contributed to the _Monthly\r\nMirror_ his “Horace in London.” In 1812 came out the _Rejected Addresses_,\r\ninimitable parodies by himself and his brother, not merely of the manner\r\nbut of the very mode of thought of Wordsworth, Cobbett, Southey,\r\nColeridge, Crabbe, Lord Byron, Scott, etc. The copyright, originally\r\noffered to Mr. Murray for £20, but declined, was purchased by him in 1819,\r\nafter the sixteenth edition, for £131; so much for the foresight of\r\npublishers. The book has since deservedly gone through endless editions,\r\nand has not been approached even by the talented parody writers of\r\n_Punch_. Those who wish to see the story of this publication in detail,\r\nmust hunt it up in the edition of the _Addresses_ illustrated by George\r\nCruickshank.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith was the chief deviser of the substance of the _Entertainments_\r\nof the elder Charles Mathews. He wrote the _Country Cousins_ in 1820, and\r\nin the two succeeding years the _Trip to France_ and the _Trip to\r\nAmerica_. For these last two works the author received a thousand pounds.\r\n“A thousand pounds!” he used to ejaculate, shrugging his shoulders, “and\r\nall for nonsense.”[247]\r\n\r\nJames Smith was just the man for Mathews, with his slight frameworks of\r\nstories filled up with songs, jokes, puns, wild farcical fancies, and\r\nmerry conceits, and here and there among the motley, with true touches of\r\nwit, pathos, and comedy, and faithful traits of life and character, such\r\nas only a close observer of society and a sound thinker could pen.\r\n\r\nHe was lucky enough to obtain a legacy of £300 for a complimentary epigram\r\non Mr. Strahan, the king’s printer. Being patted on the head when a boy by\r\nChief-Justice Mansfield, in Highgate churchyard, and once seeing Horace\r\nWalpole on his lawn at Twickenham, were the two chief historical events of\r\nMr. Smith’s quiet life. The four reasons that kept so clever a man\r\nemployed on mere amateur trifling were these--an indolent disinclination\r\nto sustained work, a fear of failure, a dislike to risk a well-earned\r\nfame, and a foreboding that literary success might injure his practice as\r\na lawyer. His favourite visits were to Lord Mulgrave’s, Mr. Croker’s,\r\nLord Abinger’s, Lady Blessington’s, and Lord Harrington’s.\r\n\r\nPretty Lady Blessington used to say of him, that “James Smith, if he had\r\nnot been a _witty_ man, must have been a _great_ man.” He died in his\r\nhouse in Craven Street, with the calmness of a philosopher, on the 24th of\r\nDecember 1839, in the sixty-fifth year of his age.[248] Fond of society,\r\nwitty without giving pain, a bachelor, and therefore glad to escape from a\r\nsolitary home, James Smith seems to have been the model of a diner-out.\r\n\r\nCaleb Whitefoord, a wine merchant in Craven Street, and an excellent\r\nconnoisseur in old pictures, was one of the legacy-hunters who infested\r\nthe studio of Nollekens, the miserly sculptor of Mortimer Street. He was a\r\nfoppish dresser, and was remarkable for a dashing three-cornered hat, with\r\na sparkling black button and a loop upon a rosette. He wore a wig with\r\nfive tiers of curls, of the Garrick cut, and he was one of the last to\r\nwear such a monstrosity. This crafty wine merchant used to distribute\r\nprivately the most whimsical of his _Cross Readings_, _Ship News_, and\r\n_Mistakes of the Press_--things in their day very popular, though now\r\nsurpassed in every number of _Punch_. Some of the best were the\r\nfollowing:--“Yesterday Dr. Pretyman preached at St. James’s,--and\r\nperformed it with ease in less than sixteen minutes.” “Several changes are\r\ntalked of at Court,--consisting of 9050 triple bob-majors.” “Dr. Solander\r\nwill, by Her Majesty’s command, undertake a voyage--round the head-dress\r\nof the present month.” “Sunday night.--Many noble families were\r\nalarmed--by the constable of the ward, who apprehended them at cards.” A\r\nsimple-hearted age could laugh heartily at these things: would that we\r\ncould!\r\n\r\nIt has often been asserted that Goldsmith’s epitaph on Whitefoord was\r\nwritten by the wine merchant himself, and sent to the editor of the fifth\r\nedition of the Poems by a convenient common friend. It is not very\r\npointed, and the length of the epitaph is certainly singular,\r\nconsidering that the poet dismissed Burke and Reynolds in less than\r\neighteen lines.\r\n\r\nAdam built an octagon room in Whitefoord’s house in order to give his\r\npictures an equal light; and Mr. Christie adopted the idea when he fitted\r\nup his large room in King Street, St. James’s.[249]\r\n\r\nGoldsmith is said to have been intimate with witty, punning Caleb\r\nWhitefoord, and certain it is his name is found in the postscript to the\r\npoem of _Retaliation_, written by Oliver on some of his friends at the St.\r\nJames’s Coffee-house. These were the Burkes, fretful Cumberland, Reynolds,\r\nGarrick, and Canon Douglas. In this poem Goldsmith laments that Whitefoord\r\nshould have confined himself to newspaper essays, and contented himself\r\nwith the praise of the printer of the _Public Advertiser_; he thus sums\r\nhim up:--\r\n\r\n  “Rare compound of oddity, frolic, and fun,\r\n  Who relish’d a joke and rejoiced in a pun;\r\n  Whose temper was generous, open, sincere;\r\n  A stranger to flattery, a stranger to fear.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “Merry Whitefoord, farewell! for thy sake I admit\r\n  That a Scot may have humour--I’d almost said wit;\r\n  This debt to thy memory I cannot refuse,\r\n  Thou best-humour’d man with the worst-humour’d Muse.”\r\n\r\nWhitefoord became Vice-President of the Society of Arts.\r\n\r\nAnthony Pasquin (Williams), a celebrated art critic and satirist of Dr.\r\nJohnson’s time, was articled to Matt Darley, the famous caricaturist of\r\nthe Strand, to learn engraving.[250]\r\n\r\nThe old name of Northumberland Street was Hartshorne Lane or Christopher\r\nAlley.[251] Here Ben Jonson lived when he was a child, and after his\r\nmother had taken a bricklayer for her second husband.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of this lane Sir Edmondbury Godfrey had his wood wharf. This\r\nfact shows how much history is illustrated by topography, for the\r\nresidence of the unfortunate justice explains why it should have been\r\nsupposed that he had been inveigled into Somerset House.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Mr. Wood, who kept a coal wharf, resided in Sir Edmondbury’s old\r\npremises at the bottom of Northumberland Street. It was here the court\r\njustice’s wood-wharf was, but his house was in Green’s Lane, near\r\nHungerford Market.[252] During the Great Plague Sir Edmondbury had been\r\nvery active; on one occasion, when his men refused to act, he entered a\r\npest-house alone to apprehend a wretch who had stolen at least a thousand\r\nwinding-sheets. Four medals were struck on his death. There is also a\r\nportrait of the unlucky woodmonger in the waiting-room adjoining the\r\nVestry of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields.[253] He wore, it seems, a full black\r\nwig, like Charles II.\r\n\r\nThree men were tried for his murder--the cushion-man at the Queen’s\r\nChapel, the servant of the treasurer of the chapel, and the porter of\r\nSomerset House. The truculent Scroggs tried the accused, and those\r\ninfamous men, Oates, Prance, and Bedloe, were the false witnesses who\r\nmurdered them. The prisoners were all executed. Sir Edmondbury’s corpse\r\nwas embalmed and borne to its funeral at St. Martin’s from Bridewell. The\r\npall was supported by eight knights, all justices of the peace, and the\r\naldermen of London followed the coffin. Twenty-two ministers marched\r\nbefore the body, and a great Protestant mob followed. Dr. William Lloyd\r\npreached the funeral sermon from the text 2 Sam. iii. 24. The preacher was\r\nguarded in the pulpit by two clergymen armed with “Protestant flails.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YORK STAIRS, WITH THE HOUSES OF PEPYS AND PETER THE GREAT,\r\nAFTER CANALETTI (CIRCA 1745).]\r\n\r\nIn July 1861, No. 16 Northumberland Street, then an old-fashioned,\r\ndingy-looking house, with narrow windows, which had been divided into\r\nchambers, was the scene of a fight for life and death between Major Murray\r\nand Mr. Roberts, a solicitor and bill-discounter; the latter attempted the\r\nlife of the former for the sake of getting possession of his mistress, to\r\nwhom he had lent money. Under pretext of advancing a loan to the Grosvenor\r\nHotel Company, of which the major was a promoter, he decoyed him into a\r\nback room on the first floor of No. 16, then shot him in the back of the\r\nneck, and immediately after in the right temple. The major, feigning to be\r\ndead, waited till Roberts’s back was turned, then springing to his feet\r\nattacked him with a pair of tongs, which he broke to pieces over his\r\nassailant’s head. He then knocked him down with a bottle which lay near,\r\nand escaped through the window, and from thence by a water-pipe to the\r\nground. Roberts died soon afterwards, but Major Murray recovered, and the\r\njury returning a verdict of “Justifiable Homicide,” he was released. The\r\npapers described Roberts’s rooms as crowded with dusty Buhl cabinets,\r\ninlaid tables, statuettes, and drawings. These were smeared with blood and\r\nwine, while on the glass shades of the ornaments a rain of blood seemed\r\nto have fallen.\r\n\r\nThe embankment, which here is very wide, and includes several acres of\r\ngarden on the spot where the Thames once flowed, has largely altered the\r\ncharacter of the streets below the Strand and the river, destroying the\r\npicturesque wharves and spoiling the appearance of the Water Gate, which\r\nis half buried in gravel and flowers, like the Sphynx in Egypt. Between it\r\nand the Thames now stands Cleopatra’s Needle, brought over to England at\r\ngreat cost of money and life, and set up here in 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROCKFORD’S FISH SHOP.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH SIDE OF THE STRAND, FROM TEMPLE BAR TO CHARING CROSS, WITH\r\nDIGRESSIONS ON THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe upper stratum of the Strand soil is composed of a reddish yellow\r\nearth, containing coprolites. Below this runs a seam of leaden-coloured\r\nclay, mixed with a few martial pyrites, calcined-looking lumps of iron\r\nand sulphur with a bright silvery fracture.\r\n\r\nA petition of the inhabitants of the vicinity of the King’s Palace at\r\nWestminster (8 Edward II.) represents the footway from Temple Bar to their\r\nneighbourhood as so bad that both rich and poor men received constant\r\ndamage, especially in the rainy season, the footway being interrupted by\r\n_bushes and thickets_. A tax was accordingly levied for the purpose, and\r\nthe mayor and sheriffs of London and the bailiff of Westminster were\r\nappointed overseers of the repairs.\r\n\r\nIn the 27th of Edward III. the Knights Templars were called upon to\r\nrepair[254] “the bridge of the new Temple,” where the lords who attended\r\nParliament took water on their way from the City. Workmen constructing a\r\nnew sewer in the Strand, in 1802, discovered, eastward of St.\r\nClement’s,[255] a small, one-arched stone bridge, supposed to be the one\r\nabove alluded to, unless it was an arch thrown over some gully when the\r\nStrand was a mere bridle-road.\r\n\r\nIn James I.’s time, Middleton, the dramatist, describes a lawyer as\r\nembracing a young spendthrift, and urging him to riot and excess, telling\r\nhim to make acquaintance with the Inns of Court gallants, and keep rank\r\nwith those that spent most; to be lofty and liberal; to lodge in the\r\nStrand; in any case, to be remote from the handicraft scent of the\r\nCity.[256]\r\n\r\nIt is but right to remind the reader that within the last few years the\r\nwhole of that part of the north side of the Strand lying between Temple\r\nBar and St. Clement’s Inn, including what was once known as Pickett\r\nStreet, and extending backward almost as far as Lincoln’s Inn, has been\r\ndemolished, in order to make room for the new Law Courts, which are now\r\nfast rising towards completion.\r\n\r\nThe house which immediately adjoined Temple Bar on the north side, to the\r\nlast a bookseller’s, stood on the site of a small pent-house of lath and\r\nplaster, occupied for many years by Crockford as a shell-fish shop. Here\r\nthis man made a large sum of money, with which he established a gambling\r\nclub, called by his name, on the west side of St. James’s Street. It was\r\nshut up at Crockford’s death in 1844, and, having passed through sundry\r\nphases, is now the Devonshire Club. Crockford would never alter his shop\r\nin his lifetime; but at his death the quaint pent-house and James I.\r\ngable[257] were removed, and a yellow brick front erected.\r\n\r\nThat great engraver, William Faithorne, after being taken prisoner as a\r\nRoyalist at Basing in the Civil Wars, went to France, where he was\r\npatronised by the Abbé de Marolles. He returned about 1650, and set up a\r\nshop--where he sold Italian, Dutch, and English prints, and worked for\r\nbooksellers--without Temple Bar, at the sign of the Ship, next the Drake\r\nand opposite the Palsgrave Head Tavern. He lived here till after 1680.\r\nGrief for his son’s misfortunes induced consumption, of which he died in\r\n1691. Flatman wrote verses to his memory. _Lady Paston_ is thought his\r\n_chef d’œuvre_.[258]\r\n\r\nShip Yard, now swept away, had been granted to Sir Christopher Hatton in\r\n1571. Wilkinson gives a fine sketch of an old gable-ended house in Ship\r\nYard, supposed to have been the residence of Elias Ashmole, the celebrated\r\nantiquarian. Here, probably, he stored his alchemic books and those\r\ntreasures of the Tradescants which he gave to Oxford.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 sundry improvements projected by Alderman Pickett led to the\r\nremoval of one of the greatest eye-sores in London--Butcher Row. This\r\nstreet of ragged lazar-houses extended in a line from Wych Street to\r\nTemple Bar. They were overhanging, drunken-looking, tottering\r\ntenements,[259] receptacles of filth, and invitations to the cholera. In\r\nDr. Johnson’s time they were mostly eating-houses.\r\n\r\nThis stack of buildings on the west side of Temple Bar was in the form of\r\nan acute-angled triangle; the eastern point, nearest the Bar, was formed\r\nlatterly by a shoemaker’s and a fishmonger’s shop, with wide fronts; its\r\nwestern point being blunted by the intersection of St. Clement’s\r\nvestry-room and almshouse. On both sides of it resided bakers, dyers,\r\nsmiths, combmakers, and tinplate-workers.\r\n\r\nThe decayed street had been a flesh-market since Queen Elizabeth’s time,\r\nwhen it flourished. A scalemaker’s, a fine-drawer’s, and Betty’s\r\nchophouse, were all to be found there.[260] The whole stack was built of\r\nwood, and was probably of about the age of Edward VI. The ceilings were\r\nlow, traversed by huge unwrought beams, and dimly lit by small casement\r\nwindows. The upper stories overhung the lower, according to the old London\r\nplan of widening the footway.\r\n\r\nIt was at Clifton’s Eating-house, in Butcher Row, in 1763, that that\r\nadmirable gossip and useful parasite, Boswell, with a tremor of foolish\r\nhorror, heard Dr. Johnson disputing with a petulant Irishman about the\r\ncause of negroes being black.\r\n\r\n“Why, sir,” said Johnson, with judicial grandeur, “it has been accounted\r\nfor in three ways--either by supposing that they were the posterity of\r\nHam, who was cursed; or that God first created two kinds of men, one black\r\nand the other white; or that by the heat of the sun the skin is scorched,\r\nand so acquires a sooty hue. This matter has been much canvassed among\r\nnaturalists, but has never been brought to any certain issue.”[261]\r\n\r\nWhat the Irishman’s arguments were, Boswell of course forgot, but as his\r\nantagonist became warm and intemperate, Johnson rose and quietly walked\r\naway. When he had retired, the Irishman said--“He has a most ungainly\r\nfigure, and an affectation of pomposity unworthy of a man of genius.”\r\n(This very same evening Boswell and his deity first supped together at the\r\nMitre.) It was here, many years later, that Johnson spent pleasant\r\nevenings with his old college friend Edwards,[262] whom he had not seen\r\nsince the golden days of youth. Edwards, a good, dull, simple-hearted\r\nfellow, talked of their age. “Don’t let us discourage one another,” said\r\nJohnson, with quiet reproof. It was this same worthy fellow who amused\r\nBurke at the club by saying--“You are a philosopher, Dr. Johnson. I have\r\ntried in my time to be a philosopher too, but I don’t know how it was,\r\ncheerfulness was always breaking in.” This was a wise blunder, worthy of\r\nGoldsmith, the prince of wise blunderers.\r\n\r\nIt was in staggering home from the Bear and Harrow in Butcher Row, through\r\nClare Market, that Lee, the poet, lay down or fell on a bulk, and was\r\nstifled in the snow (1692).\r\n\r\nNat Lee was the son of a Hertfordshire rector; a pupil of Dr. Busby, a\r\ncoadjutor of Dryden, and an unsuccessful actor. He drank himself into\r\nBedlam, where, says Oldys, he wrote a play in twenty-five acts.[263] Two\r\nof his maddest lines were--\r\n\r\n  “I’ve seen an unscrewed spider spin a thought\r\n  And walk away upon the wings of angels.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buckingham, who brought Lee up to town,[264] neglected him,\r\nand his extreme poverty no doubt drove him faster to Moorfields. Poor\r\nfellow! he was only thirty-five when he died. He is described as\r\nstout,[265] handsome, and red faced. The Earl of Pembroke, whose daughter\r\nmarried a son of the brutal Judge Jefferies, was Lee’s chief patron. The\r\npoet, when visiting him at Wilton, drank so hard that the butler is said\r\nto have been afraid he would empty the cellar. Lee’s poetry, though noisy\r\nand ranting, is full of true poetic fire,[266] and in tenderness and\r\npassion the critics of his time compared him to Ovid and Otway.\r\n\r\nThanks to the alderman, whose name is forgotten, though it well deserved\r\nto live,--the streets, lanes, and alleys which once blocked up St.\r\nClement’s Church, like so many beggars crowding round a rich man’s door,\r\nwere swept away, and the present oval railing erected. The enlightened\r\nCorporation at the same time built the big, dingy gateway of Clement’s\r\nInn--people at the time called it “stupendous;”[267] and to it were added\r\nthe restored vestry-room and almshouse. The south side of the Strand was\r\nalso rebuilt, with loftier and more spacious shops. In the reign of Edward\r\nVI. this beginning of the Strand had been a mere loosely-built suburban\r\nstreet, the southern houses, then well inhabited, boasting large gardens.\r\n\r\nThere is a fatality attending some parts of London. In spite of Alderman\r\nPickett and his stupendous arch of stucco, the new houses on the north\r\nside did not take well. They were found to be too large and expensive;\r\nthey became under-let,[268] and began by degrees to relapse into their old\r\nButcher Row squalor; the tide of humanity setting in towards Westminster\r\nflowing away from them to the left. As in some rivers the current, for no\r\nobvious reason, sometimes bends away to the one side, leaving on the other\r\na broad bare reach of grey pebble, so the human tide in the Strand has\r\nalways, in order to avoid the detour of the twin streets (Holywell and\r\nWych), borne away to the left.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Palsgrave Place, on the south side, just beyond\r\nChild’s bank, in Temple Bar without, marks the site of the Old Palsgrave’s\r\nHead Tavern. The Palsgrave was that German prince who was afterwards King\r\nof Bohemia, and who married the daughter of James I.\r\n\r\nNo. 217 Strand, on the south side, was Snow’s, the goldsmith. Gay has\r\npreserved his memory in some pleasant verses. It was, a few years ago, the\r\nbank of those most decent of defrauders, Strachan, Paul, and Bates, and\r\nthrough them proved the grave of many a fortune. Next to it, westwards,\r\nis Messrs. Twinings bank, and their still more ancient tea shop.\r\n\r\nThe Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand (south side), afterwards the\r\nWhittington Club, and now the Temple Club, is described by Strype as a\r\n“large and curious house,” with good rooms and other conveniences for\r\nentertainments.[269] Here Dr. Johnson occasionally supped with Boswell,\r\nand bartered his wisdom for the flattering Scotchman’s inanity. In this\r\nsame tavern the sultan of literature quarrelled with amiable but\r\nhigh-spirited Percy about old Dr. Mounsey; and here, when Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds was gravely and calmly upholding the advantages of wine in\r\nstimulating and inspiring conversation, Johnson said, with good-natured\r\nirony, “I have heard none of these drunken--nay, drunken is a coarse\r\nword--none of these _vinous flights_!”[270]\r\n\r\nSt. Clement’s is one of Wren’s fifty churches, and it was built by Edward\r\nPierce, under Wren’s superintendence.[271] It took the place of an old\r\nchurch mentioned by Stow, that had become old and ruinous, and was taken\r\ndown circa 1682, during the epidemic for church-building after the Great\r\nFire.\r\n\r\nThis church has many enemies and few friends. One of its bitterest haters\r\ncalls it a “disgusting fabric,” obtruded dangerously and inconveniently\r\nupon the street. A second opponent describes the steeple as fantastic, the\r\nportico clumsy and heavy, and the whole pile poor and unmeaning. Even\r\nLeigh Hunt abuses it as “incongruous and ungainly.”[272]\r\n\r\nThere have been great antiquarian discussions as to why the church is\r\ncalled St. Clement’s “Danes.” Some think there was once a massacre of the\r\nDanes in this part of the road to Westminster; others declare that Harold\r\nHarefoot was buried in the old church; some assert that the Danes, driven\r\nout of London by Alfred, were allowed to settle between Thorney Island\r\n(Westminster) and Ludgate, and built a church in the Strand; so, at\r\nleast, we learn, Recorder Fleetwood told Treasurer Burleigh. The name of\r\nSaint Clement was taken from the patron saint of Pope Clement III., the\r\nfriend of the Templars, who dwelt on the frontier line of the City.\r\n\r\nIn 1725 there was a great ferment in the parish of St. Clement’s, in\r\nconsequence of an order from Dr. Gibson, Bishop of London, to remove at\r\nonce an expensive new altar-piece painted by Kent, a fashionable\r\narchitectural quack of that day; who, however, with “Capability Brown,”\r\nhad helped to wean us from the taste for yew trees cut into shapes, Dutch\r\ncanals, formal avenues, and geometric flower-beds.\r\n\r\nKent was originally a coach-painter in Yorkshire, and was patronised by\r\nthe Queen, the Duke of Newcastle, and Lord Burlington. He helped to adorn\r\nStowe, Holkham, and Houghton. He was at once architect, painter, and\r\nlandscape gardener. In the altar-piece, the vile drawing of which even\r\nHogarth found it hard to caricature, the painter was said to have\r\nintroduced portraits of the Pretender’s wife and children. The “blue\r\nprint,” published in 1725, was followed by another representing Kent\r\npainting Burlington Gate. The altar-piece was removed, but the nobility\r\npatronised Kent till he died, twenty years or so afterwards. We owe him,\r\nhowever, some gratitude, if, according to Walpole, he was the father of\r\nmodern gardening.\r\n\r\nThe long-limbed picture caricatured by Hogarth was for some years one of\r\nthe ornaments of the coffee-room of the Crown and Anchor in the Strand.\r\nThence it was removed to the vestry-room of the church, over the old\r\nalmshouses in the churchyard. After 1803 it was transported to the new\r\nvestry-room on the north side of the churchyard.[273]\r\n\r\nIn the old church Sir Robert Cecil, the first Earl of Salisbury, was\r\nbaptized, 1563; as were Sir Charles Sedley, the delightful song-writer and\r\nthe oracle of the licentious wits of his day, 1638-9; and the Earl of\r\nShaftesbury, the son of that troublous spirit “Little Sincerity,” and\r\nhimself the author of the _Characteristics_.\r\n\r\nThe church holds some hallowed earth: in St. Clement’s was buried Sir John\r\nRoe, who was a friend of Ben Jonson, and died of the plague in the sturdy\r\npoet’s arms.\r\n\r\nDr. Donne’s wife, the daughter of Sir George More, and who died in\r\nchildbed during her husband’s absence at the court of Henri Quatre, was\r\nburied here. Her tomb, by Nicholas Stone, was destroyed when the church\r\nwas rebuilt. Donne, on his return, preached a sermon here on her death,\r\ntaking the text--“Lo! I am the man that has seen affliction.” John Lowin,\r\nthe great Shaksperean actor, lies here. He died in 1653. He acted in Ben\r\nJonson’s “Sejanus” in 1605, with Burbage and Shakspere. Tradition reports\r\nhim to have been the favourite Falstaff, Hamlet, and Henry VIII. of his\r\nday.[274] Burbage was the greatest of the Shaksperean tragedians, and\r\nTarleton the drollest of the comedians; but Lowin must have been as\r\nversatile as Garrick if he could represent Hamlet’s vacillations, and also\r\nconvey a sense of Falstaff’s unctuous humour. Poor mad Nat Lee, who died\r\non a bulk in Clare Market close by, was buried at St. Clement’s, 1692; and\r\nhere also lies poor beggared Otway, who died in 1685. In the same year as\r\nLee, Mountfort, the actor, whom Captain Hill stabbed in a fit of jealousy\r\nin Howard Street adjoining, was interred here.\r\n\r\nIn 1713 Thomas Rymer, the historiographer of William III. and the compiler\r\nof the _Fœdera_ and fifty-eight manuscript volumes now in the British\r\nMuseum, was interred here. He had lived in Arundel Street. In 1729 James\r\nSpiller, the comedian of Hogarth’s time, was buried at St. Clement’s. A\r\nbutcher in Clare Market wrote his epitaph, which was never used. Spiller\r\nwas the original Mat of the Mint in the “Beggars’ Opera.” His portrait, by\r\nLaguerre, was the sign of a public-house in Clare Market.[275]\r\n\r\nIn this church was probably buried, at the time of the Plague, Thomas\r\nSimon, Cromwell’s celebrated medallist. His name, however, is not on the\r\nregister.[276]\r\n\r\nMr. Needham, who was buried at St. Clement’s with far better men, was an\r\nattorney’s clerk in Gray’s Inn, who, in 1643, commenced a weekly paper. He\r\nseems to have been a mischievous, unprincipled hireling, always ready to\r\nsell his pen to the best bidder.\r\n\r\nIt is not for us in these later days to praise a church of the Corinthian\r\norder, even though its southern portico be crowned by a dome and propped\r\nup with Ionic pillars. Its steeple of the three orders, in spite of its\r\nvases and pilasters, does not move me; nor can I, as writers thought it\r\nnecessary to do thirty years ago,[277] waste a churchwarden’s unreasoning\r\nadmiration on the wooden cherubim, palm-branches, and shields of the\r\nchancel; nor can even the veneered pulpit and cumbrous galleries, or the\r\nTuscan carved wainscot of the altar draw any praise from my reluctant\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Dukes of Norfolk and the Earls of Arundel and Salisbury,\r\nin the south gallery, are worthy of notice, because they show that these\r\nnoblemen were once inhabitants of the parish.\r\n\r\nAmong the eminent rectors of St. Clement’s was Dr. George Berkeley, son of\r\nthe Platonist bishop, the friend of Swift, to whom Pope attributed “every\r\nvirtue under heaven.” He died in 1798. It was of his father that Atterbury\r\nsaid, he did not think that so much knowledge and so much humility existed\r\nin any but the angels and Berkeley.[278]\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson, the great and good, often attended service at St. Clement’s\r\nChurch. They still point out his seat in the north gallery, near the\r\npulpit. On Good Friday, 1773, Boswell tells us he breakfasted with his\r\ntremendous friend (Dr. Levett making tea), and was then taken to church by\r\nhim. “Dr. Johnson’s behaviour,” he says, “was solemnly devout. I never\r\nshall forget the tremulous earnestness with which he pronounced the awful\r\npetition in the Litany, ‘In the hour of death and in the day of judgment,\r\ngood Lord, deliver us.’”[279]\r\n\r\nEleven years later the doctor writes to Mrs. Thrale, “after a confinement\r\nof 129 days, more than the third part of a year, and no inconsiderable\r\npart of human life, I this day returned thanks to God in St. Clement’s\r\nChurch for my recovery--a recovery, in my 75th year, from a distemper\r\nwhich few in the vigour of youth are known to surmount.”\r\n\r\nClement’s Inn (of Chancery), a vassal of the Inner Temple, derives its\r\nname from the neighbouring church, and the “fair fountain called Clement’s\r\nWell,”[280] the Holy Well of the neighbouring street pump.\r\n\r\nOver the gate is graven in stone an anchor without a stock and a capital C\r\ncouchant upon it.[281] This device has reference to the martyrdom of the\r\nguardian saint of the inn, who was tied to an anchor and thrown into the\r\nsea by order of the emperor Trajan. Dugdale states that there was an inn\r\nhere in the reign of Edward II.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, a tradition among antiquaries, that as far back as the\r\nSaxon kings there was an inn here for the reception of penitents who came\r\nto the Holy Well of St. Clement’s; that a religious house was first\r\nestablished, and finally a church. The Holy Lamb, an inn at the west end\r\nof the lane, was perhaps the old Pilgrims’ Inn. In the Tudor times the\r\nClare family, who had a mansion in Clare Market, appears to have occupied\r\nthe site. From their hands it reverted to the lawyers. As for the well, a\r\npump now enshrines it, and a low dirty street leads up to it. This is\r\nmentioned in Henry II.’s time[282] as one of the excellent springs at a\r\nsmall distance from London, whose waters are “sweet, healthful, and clear,\r\nand whose runnels murmur over the shining pebbles: they are much\r\nfrequented,” says the friend of Archbishop Becket, “both by the scholars\r\nfrom the school (Westminster) and the youth from the City, when on a\r\nsummer’s evening they are disposed to take an airing.” It was seven\r\ncenturies ago that the hooded boys used to play round this spring, and at\r\nthis very moment their descendants are drinking from the ladle or\r\nsplashing each other with the water, as they fill their great brown\r\npitchers. The spring still feeds the Roman Bath in the Strand already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n  “For men may come, and men may go,\r\n      But I flow on for ever.”[283]\r\n\r\nThe hall of St. Clement’s Inn is situated on the south side of a neat\r\nsmall quadrangle. It is a small Tuscan building, with a large florid\r\nCorinthian door and arched windows, and was built in 1715. In the second\r\nirregular area there is a garden, with a statue of a kneeling black figure\r\nsupporting a sun-dial on the east side.[284] It was given to the inn by an\r\nEarl of Clare, but when is unknown. It was brought from Italy, and is said\r\nto be of bronze, but ingenious persons having determined on making it a\r\nblackamoor, it has been painted black. A stupid, ill-rhymed, cumbrous old\r\nepigram sneers at the sable son of woe flying from cannibals and seeking\r\nmercy in a lawyers’ inn. The first would not have eaten him till they had\r\nslain him; but lawyers, it is well known, will eat any man alive.[285]\r\n\r\nPoor Hollar, the great German engraver, lived in 1661 just outside the\r\nback door of St. Clement’s, “as soon as you come off the steps, and out of\r\nthat house and dore at your left hand, two payre of stairs, into a little\r\npassage right before you.” He was known for “reasons’ sake” to the people\r\nof the house only as “the Frenchman limner.” Such was the direction he\r\nsent to that gossiping Wiltshire gentleman, John Aubrey.\r\n\r\nThe inn has very probably reared up a great many clever men; but it is\r\nchiefly renowned for having fostered that inimitable old bragging twaddler\r\nand country magistrate, the immortal Justice Shallow. Those chimes that\r\n“in a ghostly way by moonlight still bungle through Handel’s psalm tunes,\r\nhoarse with age and long vigils”[286] as they are, must surely be the same\r\nthat Shallow heard. How deliciously the old fellow vapours about his wild\r\ntimes!\r\n\r\n“Ha, Cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this knight and I have\r\nseen!--Ha, Sir John, said I well?”\r\n\r\n_Falstaff_--“We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.”\r\n\r\n_Shal._--“That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, Sir John, we\r\nhave; our watchword was--Hem, boys!--Come, let’s to dinner; come, let’s to\r\ndinner. Oh, the days that we have seen!--Come, come.”[287]\r\n\r\nAnd before that, how he glories in the impossibility of being detected\r\nafter bragging fifty-five years! This man, as Falstaff says, “lean as a\r\nman cut after supper out of a cheese-paring,” was once mad Shallow, lusty\r\nShallow, as Cousin Silence, his toady, reminds him.\r\n\r\n“By the mass,” says again the old country gentleman, “I was called\r\nanything, and I would have done anything, indeed, and roundly too. There\r\nwas I and little John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Barnes of\r\nStaffordshire, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele, a Cotswold man: you\r\nhad not four such swinge-bucklers in all the inns of court again.”\r\n\r\nAnd thus he goes maundering on with dull vivacity about how he played Sir\r\nDagonet in Arthur’s Show at Mile End, and once remained all night\r\nrevelling in a windmill in St. George’s Fields.\r\n\r\nA curious record of Shakspere’s times serves admirably to illustrate\r\nShallow’s boast. In Elizabeth’s time the eastern end of the Strand was the\r\nscene of frequent disturbances occasioned by the riotous and unruly\r\nstudents of the inns of court, who paraded the streets at night to the\r\ndanger of peaceable passengers. One night in 1582, the Recorder himself,\r\nwith six of the honest inhabitants, stood by St. Clement’s Church to see\r\nthe lanterns hung out, and to try and meet some of the brawlers, the\r\nShallows of that time. About seven at night they saw young Mr. Robert\r\nCecil, the Treasurer’s son, pass by the church and salute them civilly, on\r\nwhich they said, “Lo, you may see how a nobleman’s son can use himself,\r\nand how he pulleth off his cap to poor men--our Lord bless him!” Upon\r\nwhich the Recorder wrote to his father, like a true courtier, making\r\ncapital of everything, and said, “Your lordship hath cause to thank God\r\nfor so virtuous a child.”\r\n\r\nThrough the gateway in Pickett Street, a narrow street led to New Court,\r\nwhere stood the Independent Meeting House in which the witty Daniel\r\nBurgess once preached. The celebrated Lord Bolingbroke was his pupil, and\r\nthe Earl of Orrery his patron. He died 1712, after being much ridiculed by\r\nSwift and Steele for his sermon of _The Golden Snuffers_, and for his\r\npulpit puns in the manner followed by Rowland Hill and Whitfield. This\r\nchapel was gutted during the Sacheverell riots, and repaired by the\r\nGovernment. Two examples of Burgess’s grotesque style will suffice. On one\r\noccasion, when he had taken his text from Job, and discoursed on the “Robe\r\nof Righteousness,” he said--\r\n\r\n“If any of you would have a good and cheap suit, you will go to Monmouth\r\nStreet; if you want a suit for life, you will go to the Court of Chancery;\r\nbut if you wish for a suit that will last to eternity, you must go to the\r\nLord Jesus Christ and put on His robe of righteousness.”[288] On another\r\noccasion, in the reign of King William, he assigned as a motive for the\r\ndescendants of Jacob being called Israelites, that God did not choose that\r\nHis people should be called _Jacobites_.\r\n\r\nDaniel Burgess was succeeded in his chapel by Winter and Bradbury, both\r\ncelebrated Nonconformists. The latter of these was also a comic preacher,\r\nor rather a “buffoon,” as one of Dr. Doddridge’s correspondents called\r\nhim. It was said of his sermons that he seemed to consider the Bible to be\r\nwritten only to prove the right of William III. to the throne. He used to\r\nderide Dr. Watts’s hymns from the pulpit, and when he gave them out always\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n  “Let us sing one of Watts’s whims.”\r\n\r\nBat Pidgeon, the celebrated barber of Addison’s time, lived nearly\r\nopposite Norfolk Street. His house bore the sign of the Three Pigeons.\r\nThis was the corner house of St. Clement’s churchyard, and there Bat, in\r\n1740, cut the boyish locks of Pennant[289]. In those days of wigs there\r\nwere very few hair-cutters in London.\r\n\r\nThe father of Miss Ray, the singer, and mistress of old Lord Sandwich, is\r\nsaid to have been a well-known staymaker in Holywell Street, now\r\nBooksellers’ Row. His daughter was apprenticed in Clerkenwell, from whence\r\nthe musical lord took her to load her with a splendid shame. On the day\r\nshe went to sing at Covent Garden in “Love in a Village,” Hackman, who had\r\nleft the army for the church, waited for her carriage at the Cannon\r\nCoffee-house in Cockspur Street. At the door of the theatre, by the side\r\nof the Bedford Coffee-house, Hackman rushed out, and as Miss Ray was being\r\nhanded from her carriage he shot her through the head, and then attempted\r\nhis own life[290]. Hackman was hanged at Tyburn, and he died declaring\r\nthat shooting Miss Ray was the result of a sudden burst of frenzy, for he\r\nhad planned only suicide in her presence.\r\n\r\nThe Strand Maypole stood on the site of the present church of St. Mary le\r\nStrand, or a little northward towards Maypole Alley, behind the Olympic\r\nTheatre. In the thirteenth century a cross had stood on this spot, and\r\nthere the itinerant justices had sat to administer justice outside the\r\nwalls. A Maypole stood here as early as 1634[291]. Tradition says it was\r\nset up by John Clarges, the Drury Lane blacksmith, and father of General\r\nMonk’s vulgar wife.\r\n\r\nThe Maypole was Satan’s flag-staff in the eyes of the stern Puritans, who\r\ndreaded Christmas pies, cards, and dances. Down it came when Cromwell went\r\nup. The Strand Maypole was reared again with exulting ceremony the first\r\nMay day after the Restoration. The parishioners bought a pole 134 feet\r\nhigh, and the Duke of York, the Lord High Admiral, lent them twelve seamen\r\nto help to raise it. It was brought from Scotland Yard with drums, music,\r\nand the shouts of the multitude; flags flying, and three men bare-headed\r\ncarrying crowns.[292] The two halves being joined together with iron\r\nbands, and the gilt crown and vane and king’s arms placed on the top, it\r\nwas raised in about four hours by means of tackle and pulleys. The Strand\r\nrang with the people’s shouts, for to them the Maypole was an emblem of\r\nthe good old times. Then there was a morris dance, with tabor and pipe,\r\nthe dancers wearing purple scarfs and “half-shirts.” The children laughed,\r\nand the old people clapped their hands, for there was not a taller Maypole\r\nin Europe. From its summit floated a royal purple streamer; and half way\r\ndown was a sort of cross-trees or balcony adorned with four crowns and the\r\nking’s arms. It bore also a garland of vari-coloured favours, and beneath\r\nthree great lanterns in honour of the three admirals and all seamen, to\r\ngive light in dark nights. On this spot, a year before, the butchers of\r\nClare Market had rung a peal with their knives as they burnt an\r\nemblematical Rump.[293]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1677 a fatal duel was fought under the Maypole, which had been\r\nsnapped by a tempest in 1672.[294] One daybreak Mr. Robert Percival, a\r\nnotorious duellist, only nineteen years of age, was found dead under the\r\nMaypole, with a deep wound in his left breast. His drawn and bloody sword\r\nlay beside him. His antagonist was never discovered, though great rewards\r\nwere offered. The only clue was a hat with a bunch of ribbons in it,\r\nsuspected to belong to the celebrated Beau Fielding, but it was never\r\ntraced home to him. The elder brother, Sir Philip Percival, long after,\r\nviolently attacked a total stranger whom he met in the streets of Dublin.\r\nThe spectators parted them. Sir Philip could account for his conduct only\r\nby saying he felt urged on by an irresistible conviction that the man he\r\nstruck at was his brother’s murderer.[295]\r\n\r\nThe Maypole, disused and decaying, was pulled down in 1713, when a new\r\none, adorned with two gilt balls and a vane, was erected in its stead. In\r\n1718 the pole, being found in the way of the new church, was given to Sir\r\nIsaac Newton as a stand for a large French telescope that belonged to his\r\nfriend Mr. Pound, the rector of Wanstead.\r\n\r\nSaint Mary-le-Strand was begun in 1714, and consecrated in 1723-4.[296] It\r\nwas one of the fifty ordered to be built in Queen Anne’s reign. The old\r\nchurch, pulled down by that Ahab, the Protector Somerset, to make room for\r\nhis ill-omened new palace, stood considerably nearer to the river.\r\n\r\nGibbs, the shrewd Aberdeen architect, who succeeded to Wren and Vanbrugh,\r\nand became famous by building St. Martin’s Church, reared also St. Mary’s.\r\nGibbs, according to Walpole, was a mere plodding mechanic. He certainly\r\nwanted originality, simplicity, and grace. St. Mary’s is broken up by\r\nunmeaning ornament; the pagoda-like steeple is too high,[297] and crushes\r\nthe church, instead of as it were blossoming from it. One critic (Mr.\r\nMalton) alone is found to call St. Mary’s pleasant and picturesque; but I\r\nconfess to having looked on it so long that I begin almost to forget its\r\nugliness.\r\n\r\nGibbs himself tells us how he set to work upon this church. It was his\r\nfirst commission after his return from Rome. As the site was a very public\r\none, he was desired to spare no cost in the ornamentation, so he framed it\r\nof two orders, making the lower walls (but for the absurd niches to hold\r\nnothing) solid, so as to keep out the noises of the street. There was at\r\nfirst no steeple intended, only a small western campanile, or bell-turret;\r\nbut, eighty feet from the west front, there was to be erected a column 250\r\nfeet high, crowned by a statue of Queen Anne. This absurdity was forgotten\r\nat the death of that rather insipid queen, and the stone still lying\r\nthere, the thrifty parish authorities, unwilling to waste the materials,\r\nresolved to build a steeple. The church being already twenty feet from the\r\nground, it was necessary to spread it north and south, and so the church,\r\noriginally square, became oblong.\r\n\r\nPope calls St. Mary’s Church bitterly the church that--\r\n\r\n  Collects “the _saints_ of Drury Lane.”[298]\r\n\r\nAddison describes his Tory fox-hunter’s horror on seeing a church\r\napparently being demolished, and his agreeable surprise when he found it\r\nwas really a church being built.[299]\r\n\r\nSt. Mary’s was the scene of a tragedy during the proclamation of the short\r\npeace in 1802. Just as the heralds came abreast of Somerset House, a man\r\non the roof of the church pressed forward too strongly against one of the\r\nstone urns, which gave way and fell into the street, striking down three\r\npersons: one of these died on the spot; the second, on his way to the\r\nhospital; and the third, two days afterwards. A young woman and several\r\nothers were also seriously injured. The urn, which weighed two hundred\r\npounds, carried away part of the cornice, broke a flag-stone below, and\r\nburied itself a foot deep in the earth. The unhappy cause of this mischief\r\nfell back on the roof and fainted when he saw the urn fall. He was\r\ndischarged, no blame being attached to him. It was found that the urn had\r\nbeen fastened by a wooden spike, instead of being clamped with iron.[300]\r\n\r\nThe church has been lately refitted in an ecclesiastical style, and filled\r\nwith painted windows. There are no galleries in its interior. The ceiling\r\nis encrusted with ornament. It contains a tablet to the memory of James\r\nBindley, who died in 1818. He was the father of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, and was a great collector of books, prints, and medals.\r\n\r\nNew Inn, in Wych Street, is an inn of Chancery, appertaining to the Middle\r\nTemple. It was originally a public inn, bearing the sign of Our Lady the\r\nVirgin, and was bought by Sir John Fineux, Chief Justice of the King’s\r\nBench, in the reign of King Edward IV., to place therein the students of\r\nthe law then lodged in St. George’s Inn, in the little Old Bailey, which\r\nwas reputed to have been the most ancient of all the inns of\r\nChancery.[301]\r\n\r\nSir Thomas More, the luckless minister of Henry VIII., was a member of\r\nthis inn till he removed to Lincoln’s Inn. When the Great Seal was taken\r\nfrom this wise man, he talked of descending to “New Inn fare, wherewith\r\nmany an honest man is well contented.”[302] Addison makes the second best\r\nman of his band of friends (after Sir Roger de Coverley) a bachelor\r\nTemplar; an excellent critic, with whom the time of the play is an hour of\r\nbusiness. “Exactly at five he passes through New Inn, crosses through\r\nRussell Court, and takes a turn at Wills’s till the play begins. He has\r\nhis shoes rubbed and his periwig powdered at the barber’s as you go into\r\nthe Rose.”[303]\r\n\r\nWych Street derives its name from the old name for Drury Lane--_via de\r\nAldewych_. Till some recent improvements were effected in its tenants, it\r\nbore an infamous character, and was one of the disgraces of London.\r\n\r\nThe Olympic Theatre, in Wych Street, was built in 1805 by Philip Astley, a\r\nlight horseman, who founded the first amphitheatre in London on the garden\r\nground of old Craven House. It was opened September 18, 1806, as the\r\nOlympic Pavilion, and burnt to the ground March 29, 1849. It was built out\r\nof the timbers of the captured French man-of-war, _La Ville de Paris_, in\r\nwhich William IV. went out as midshipman. The masts of the vessel formed\r\nthe flies, and were seen still standing amidst the fire after the roof\r\nfell in. In 1813 it was leased by Elliston, and called the Little Drury\r\nLane Theatre. Its great days were under the rule of Madame Vestris,[304]\r\nwho, both as a singer and an actress, contributed to its success. More\r\nrecently it was under the able and successful management of the late Mr.\r\nFrederick Robson. Born at Margate in 1821, he was early in life\r\napprenticed to a copperplate engraver in Bedfordbury. He appeared first,\r\nunsuccessfully, at a private theatre in Catherine Street, and played at\r\nthe Grecian Saloon as a comic singer and low comedian from 1846 to 1849.\r\nIn 1853 he joined Mr. Farren at the Olympic. He there acquired a great\r\nreputation in various pieces--“The Yellow Dwarf,” “To oblige Benson,” “The\r\nLottery Ticket,” and “The Wandering Minstrel,”--the last being an old\r\nfarce originally written to ridicule the vagaries of Mr. Cochrane.\r\n\r\nLyon’s Inn, an inn of Chancery belonging to the Inner Temple, was\r\noriginally a hostelry with the sign of the Lion. It was purchased by\r\ngentlemen students in Henry VIII.’s time, and converted into an inn of\r\nChancery.[305]\r\n\r\nIt degenerated into a haunt of bill-discounters and Bohemians of all\r\nkinds, good and bad, clever and rascally, and remained a dim, mouldy place\r\ntill 1861, when it was pulled down. Its site is now occupied by the Globe\r\nTheatre. Just before the demolition of the inn, when I visited it, a\r\nwasherwoman was hanging out wet and flopping clothes on the site of Mr.\r\nWilliam Weare’s chambers.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, 24th of October 1823, Mr. William Weare, of No. 2 Lyon’s Inn,\r\nwas murdered in Gill’s Hill Lane, Hertfordshire, between Edgware and St.\r\nAlban’s. His murderer was Mr. John Thurtell, son of the Mayor of Norwich,\r\nand a well-known gambler, betting man, and colleague of prize-fighters.\r\nUnder pretence of driving him down for a shooting excursion, Thurtell shot\r\nWeare with a pistol, and when he leaped out of the chaise, pursued him\r\nand cut his throat. He then sank the body in a pond in the garden of his\r\nfriend and probable accomplice, Probert, a spirit merchant, and afterwards\r\nremoved it to a slough on the St. Alban’s road. His confederate, Hunt, a\r\npublic singer, turned king’s evidence, and was transported for life.\r\nThurtell was hanged at Hertford. He pleaded that Weare had robbed him of\r\n£300 with false cards at Blind Hookey, and he had sworn revenge; but it\r\nappeared that he had planned several other murders, and all for money.\r\nProbert was afterwards hanged in Gloucestershire for horse-stealing.\r\n\r\nAt the sale of the building materials some Jews were observed to be very\r\neager to acquire the figure of the lion that adorned one of the walls.\r\nThere were various causes assigned for this eagerness. Some said that a\r\nJew named Lyons had originally founded the inn; others declared that the\r\nlion was considered to be an emblem of the Lion of the tribe of Judah.\r\nDirectly the auctioneer knocked it down the Jewish purchaser drew a knife,\r\nmounted the ladder, and struck his weapon into the lion. “S’help me, Bob!”\r\nsaid he, in a tone of disgust, “if they didn’t tell me it was lead, and\r\nit’s only stone arter all!”\r\n\r\nGay, who speaks of the dangers of “mazy Drury Lane,” gives Catherine\r\nStreet a very bad character. He describes the courtesans, with their\r\nnew-scoured manteaus and riding-hoods or muffled pinners, standing near\r\nthe tavern doors, or carrying empty bandboxes, and feigning errands to the\r\nChange.[306] The street is now almost entirely occupied by newspaper\r\npublishers. The _Morning Herald_, the _Court Journal_, the _Naval and\r\nMilitary Gazette_, the _Gardener’s Gazette_, the _Builder_, the _Weekly\r\nRegister_, and the _Court Gazette_, all either are or have been published\r\nin Catherine Street. Scott’s Sanspareil Theatre was opened here about 1810\r\nfor the performance of operettas, dancing, and pantomimes.[307] In\r\nSeptember 1741 a man named James Hall was executed at the end of Catherine\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThe Maypole close to St. Mary’s Church is said to have been the first\r\nplace in London where hackney coaches were allowed to stand. Coaches were\r\nfirst introduced into England from Hungary in 1580 by Fitzalan, Earl of\r\nArundel; but for a time they were thought effeminate. The Thames watermen\r\nespecially railed against them, as might be expected. In the year 1634, a\r\nCaptain Baily who had accompanied Raleigh in his famous expedition to\r\nGuiana, started four hackney coaches, with drivers in liveries, at the\r\nMaypole; but as, in the year 1613, sixty hackney coaches from London[308]\r\nplied at Stourbridge fair, perhaps there had been coach-stands in the\r\nstreets before Baily’s time. In 1625 there were only twenty coaches in\r\nLondon; in 1666, under Charles II., the number had so increased that the\r\nking issued a proclamation complaining of the coaches blocking up the\r\nnarrow streets and breaking up the pavement, and forbade coach-stands\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nPeter Molyn Tempest, the engraver of “The Cries of London,” published at\r\nthe end of King William’s reign, lived in the Strand opposite Somerset\r\nHouse. “The Cries” were designed by Marcellus Laroon, a Dutch painter\r\n(1653-1702), who painted draperies for Kneller.[309] He was celebrated for\r\nhis conversation pieces and his knack of imitating the old masters.\r\nTempest’s quaint advertisement of the “Cries” in the _London Gazette_, May\r\n28 and 31, 1688, runs thus:--\r\n\r\n“There is now published the Cryes and Habits of London, lately drawn after\r\nthe life in great variety of actions, curiously engraved upon fifty\r\ncopper-plates, fit for the ingenious and lovers of art. Printed and sold\r\nby P. Tempest, over against Somerset House, in the Strand.”\r\n\r\nThe _Morning Chronicle_, whose office was opposite Somerset House, was\r\nstarted in 1770. It was to Perry, of the _Morning Chronicle_, that\r\nColeridge, when penniless and about to enlist in a cavalry regiment, sent\r\na poem and a request for a guinea, which he got. Hazlitt was theatrical\r\ncritic to this paper, succeeding Lord Campbell in the post. In 1810 David\r\nRicardo began his letters on the depreciation of the currency in the\r\n_Chronicle_. James Perry, whose career we have no room to follow, lived in\r\ngreat style at Tavistock House, the house afterwards occupied for many\r\nyears by Mr. Charles Dickens. _The Sketches by Boz_ of Charles Dickens\r\nfirst appeared in the columns of the _Chronicle_. The last _Morning\r\nChronicle_ appeared on Wednesday, March 19, 1862. Latterly the paper was\r\nsaid to have been in the pay of the Emperor of France.\r\n\r\nNo. 346, at the east corner of Wellington Street, now the office of the\r\n_Law Times_, the _Queen_, and the _Field_, was Doyley’s celebrated\r\nwarehouse for woollen articles. Dryden, in his _Kind Keeper_, speaks of\r\n“Doyley” petticoats; Steele, in his _Guardian_,[310] of his “Doyley” suit;\r\nwhile Gay, in the _Trivia_, describes a “Doyley” as a poor defence against\r\nthe cold.\r\n\r\nDoyley’s warehouse stood on the ancient site of Wimbledon House, built by\r\nSir Edward Cecil, son to the first Earl of Exeter, and created Viscount\r\nWimbledon by Charles I. The house was burnt to the ground in 1628, and the\r\nday before the viscount had had part of his house at Wimbledon\r\naccidentally blown up by gunpowder. Pennant, when a boy, was brought by\r\nhis mother to a large glass shop, a little beyond Wimbledon House; the old\r\nman who kept it remembered Nell Gwynne coming to the shop when he was an\r\napprentice; her footman, a country lad, got fighting in the street with\r\nsome men who had abused his mistress.[311]\r\n\r\nMr. Doyley was a much respected warehouseman of Dr. Johnson’s time, whose\r\nfamily had resided in their great old house, next to Hodsall the banker’s,\r\nat the corner of Wellington Street, ever since Queen Anne’s time. The\r\ndessert napkins called Doyleys derived their name from this firm. Mr.\r\nDoyley’s house was built by Inigo Jones, and forms a prominent feature in\r\nold engravings of the Strand, as it had a covered entrance that ran out\r\nlike a promontory into the carriage-way. It was pulled down about\r\n1782.[312] Mr. Doyley, a man of humour and a friend of Garrick and\r\nSterne, was a frequenter of the Precinct Club, held at the Turk’s Head,\r\nopposite his own house. The rector of St. Mary’s attended the same club,\r\nand enjoyed the seat of honour next the fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD ROMAN BATH, STRAND.]\r\n\r\nNot far from this stood the Strand Bridge, which crossed the street, and\r\nreceived the streams flowing from the higher grounds down Catharine Street\r\nto the Thames. Strand Lane, hard by on the south, famous still for its old\r\nRoman bath, passed under the arch, and led to a water stair or landing\r\npier. Addison, in his bright pleasant way, describes landing there one\r\nmorning with ten sail of apricot boats, after having put in at Nine Elms\r\nfor melons, consigned by Mr. Cuffe of that place to Sarah Sewell and\r\nCompany at their stall in Covent Garden.[313]\r\n\r\nThe _Morning Post_, whose office is in Wellington Street, was started in\r\n1772; when almost defunct it was bought in 1796 by Daniel Stuart, and\r\nChristie the auctioneer, who gave only £600 for copyright, house, and\r\nplant. Coleridge, Southey, Lamb, Wordsworth, and Mackintosh all wrote for\r\nStuart’s paper. Coleridge commenced his political papers in 1797, and on\r\nhis return from Germany (November 1799) joined the badly-paid staff, but\r\nrefused to become a parliamentary reporter. Fox declared in the House of\r\nCommons that Coleridge’s essays had led to the rupture of the peace of\r\nAmiens, an announcement which led to a pursuit by a French frigate, when\r\nthe poet left Rome, where he then was, and sailed from Leghorn. Lamb wrote\r\nfacetious paragraphs at sixpence a-piece.[314] The _Morning Post_ soon\r\nbecame second only to the _Chronicle_, and the great paper for\r\nbooksellers’ advertisements. It is mentioned by Byron as the organ of the\r\naristocracy and of West End society, and it has maintained that position\r\nto the present time with little change.\r\n\r\nThe _Athenæum_, whose office is in Wellington Street, is identified with\r\nthe name of Mr. (afterwards) Sir C. Wentworth Dilke. He was born in 1789,\r\nand was originally in the Navy Pay Office. He bought the paper, which had\r\nbeen unsuccessful since 1828 under its originator, that shifty adventurer,\r\nMr. J. S. Buckingham, and also under Mr. John Sterling. Under his care it\r\ngradually grew into a sound property, and became what it now is, the\r\n_Times_ of weekly papers. Its editor, Mr. Hervey, the author of many\r\nwell-known poems, was replaced in 1853 by Mr. Hepworth Dixon, under whom\r\nit steadily throve, till his retirement in 1871.\r\n\r\nA little farther up the street is the office of _All the Year Round_, a\r\nweekly periodical which, in 1859, took the place of _Household Words_,\r\nstarted by Mr. Charles Dickens in 1850. It contains essays by the best\r\nwriters of the day, graphic descriptions of current events, and continuous\r\nstories. Mrs. Gaskell, Mr. Wilkie Collins, Charles Reade, Lord Lytton,\r\nMr. Sala, and Mr. Dickens himself, are among those who have published\r\nnovels in its pages.\r\n\r\nThe original Lyceum was built in 1765 as an exhibition-room for the\r\nSociety of Arts, by Mr. James Payne, an architect, on ground once\r\nbelonging to Exeter House. The society splitting, and the Royal Academy\r\nbeing founded at Somerset House in 1768, the Lyceum Society became\r\ninsolvent. Mr. Lingham, a breeches-maker, then purchased the room, and let\r\nit out to Flockton for his Puppet-show and other amusements. About 1794\r\nDr. Arnold partly rebuilt it as a theatre, but could not obtain a licence\r\nthrough the opposition of the winter houses.[315] It was next door to the\r\nshop of Millar the publisher.\r\n\r\nThe Lyceum in 1789-94 was the arena of all experimenters--of Charles\r\nDibdin and his “Sans Souci,” of the ex-soldier Astley’s feats of\r\nhorsemanship, of Cartwright’s “Musical Glasses,” of Philipstal’s\r\nsuccessful “Phantasmagoria.” Lonsdale’s “Egyptiana” (paintings of Egyptian\r\nscenes, by Porter, Mulready, Pugh, and Cristall), with a lecture, was a\r\nfailure. Here Ker Porter exhibited his large pictures of Lodi, Acre, and\r\nthe siege of Seringapatam. Then came Palmer with his “Portraits,” Collins\r\nwith his “Evening Brush,” Incledon with his “Voyage to India,” Bologna\r\nwith his “Phantascopia,” and Lloyd with his “Astronomical Exhibition.”\r\nSubscription concerts, amateur theatricals, debating societies, and\r\nschools of defence were also tried here. One day it was a Roman Catholic\r\nchapel; next day the “Panther Mare and Colt,” the “White Negro Girl,” or\r\nthe “Porcupine Man” held their levee of dupes and gapers in its changeful\r\nrooms.[316]\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Dr. Arnold’s son obtained a licence for an English opera-house.\r\nShortly afterwards the Drury Lane company commenced performing here, their\r\nown theatre having been burnt. Mr. T. Sheridan was then manager. In 1815\r\nMr. Arnold erected the predecessor of the present theatre, on an enlarged\r\nscale, at an expense of nearly £80,000, and it was opened in 1816. In 1817\r\nthe experiment of two short performances on the same evening was\r\nunsuccessfully tried. On April 1, 1818, Mr. Mathews, the great comedian,\r\nbegan here his entertainment called “Mail-coach Adventures,” which ran\r\nforty nights.\r\n\r\nThe Beef-steak Club was established in the reign of Queen Anne (before\r\n1709).[317] The _Spectator_ mentions it, 1710-11. The club met in a noble\r\nroom at the top of Covent Garden Theatre, and never partook of any dish\r\nbut beef-steaks. Their Providore was their president and wore their badge,\r\na small gold gridiron, hung round his neck by a green silk riband.[318]\r\nEstcourt had been a tavern-keeper, and is mentioned in a poem of\r\nParnell’s, who was himself too fond of wine. He died in 1712. Steele gives\r\na delightful sketch of him. He had an excellent judgment, he was a great\r\nmimic, and he told an anecdote perfectly well. His well-turned compliments\r\nwere as fine as his smart repartees. “It is to Estcourt’s exquisite talent\r\nmore than to philosophy,” says Steele, “that I owe the fact that my person\r\nis very little of my care, and it is indifferent to me what is said of my\r\nshape, my air, my manner, my speech, or my address. It is to poor Estcourt\r\nI chiefly owe that I am arrived at the happiness of thinking nothing a\r\ndiminution of myself but what argues a depravity of my will.”\r\n\r\nThe kindly essay ends beautifully. “None of those,” says the true-hearted\r\nman, “will read this without giving him some sorrow for their abundant\r\nmirth, and one gush of tears for so many bursts of laughter. I wish it\r\nwere any honour to the pleasant creature’s memory that my eyes are too\r\nmuch suffused to let me go on.”\r\n\r\nLater, Churchill and Wilkes, those partners in dissoluteness and satire,\r\nwere members of this social club. After Estcourt, that jolly companion,\r\nBeard the singer, became president of this jovial and agreeable company.\r\n\r\nIt was an old custom at theatres to have a Beef-steak Club that met every\r\nSaturday, and to which authors and wits were invited. In 1749 Mr.\r\nSheridan, the manager, founded one at Dublin. There were fifty or sixty\r\nmembers, chiefly noblemen and members of Parliament, and no performer was\r\nadmitted but witty Peg Woffington, who wore man’s dress, and was president\r\nfor a whole season.[319]\r\n\r\nA Beef-steak Society was founded in 1735 by John Rich, the great\r\nharlequin, and manager of Covent Garden Theatre, and George Lambert, the\r\nscene-painter.[320] Lambert, being much visited by authors, wits, and\r\nnoblemen, whilst painting, and being too hurried to go to a tavern, used\r\nto have a steak cooked in the room, inviting his guests to share his snug\r\nand savoury but hurried meal. The fun of these accidental and impromptu\r\ndinners led to a club being started, which afterwards moved to a more\r\nconvenient room in the theatre. After many years the place of meeting was\r\nchanged to the Shakspere Tavern, where Mr. Lambert’s portrait, painted by\r\nHudson, Reynolds’s pompous master, was one of the decorations of the\r\nclub-room.[321] They then returned to the theatre, but being burned out in\r\n1812, adjourned to the Bedford. Lambert was the merriest of fellows, yet\r\nwithout buffoonery or coarseness. His manners were most engaging, he was\r\nsocial with his equals, and perfectly easy with richer men.[322] He was\r\nalso a great leader of fun at old Slaughter’s artist-club.\r\n\r\nThe club throve down to about 1869, when it was dissolved; steaks were\r\nperennial as a dish, whatever the wit may have been, to the last.\r\nTwenty-four noblemen and gentlemen, each of whom might bring a friend,\r\npartook of a five o’clock dinner of steaks in a room of their own behind\r\nthe scenes at the Lyceum Theatre every Saturday from November till June.\r\nThey called themselves “The Steaks,” disclaimed the name of “Club,” and\r\ndedicated their hours to “Beef and Liberty,” as their ancestors did in the\r\nanti-Walpole days.[323]\r\n\r\nTheir room was a little typical Escurial. The doors, wainscot, and floor,\r\nwere of stout oak, emblazoned with gridirons, like a chapel of St.\r\nLaurence. The cook was seen at his office through the bars of a vast\r\ngridiron, and the original gridiron of the society (the survivor of two\r\nterrific fires) held a conspicuous position in the centre of the ceiling.\r\nThis club descended lineally from Wilkes’s and from Lambert’s. To the end\r\nthere was Attic salt enough to sprinkle over “the Steaks,” and to justify\r\nthe old epicure’s lines to the club:--\r\n\r\n  “He that of honour, wit, and mirth partakes,\r\n  May be a fit companion o’er beef-steaks;\r\n  His name may be to future times enrolled\r\n  In Estcourt’s book, whose gridiron’s framed of gold.”[324]\r\n\r\nIts gridiron and other treasures were sold by auction, and fetched\r\nfabulous prices.\r\n\r\nDr. William King, the author of the above quoted verses, was an indolent,\r\nwrong-headed genius. Some three years after the Restoration he took part\r\nagainst the irascible Bentley in the dispute about the Epistles of\r\nPhalaris, satirised Sir Hans Sloane, and supported Sacheverell. He wrote\r\n_The Art of Cookery_, _Dialogues of the Dead_, _The Art of Love_, and\r\n_Greek Mythology for Schools_. Recklessly throwing up his Irish Government\r\nappointment, he came to London. There Swift got him appointed manager of\r\nthe _Gazette_; but being idle, and fond of the bottle, he resigned his\r\noffice in six months, and went to live at a friend’s house in the garden\r\ngrounds between Lambeth and Vauxhall. He died in 1712, in lodgings\r\nopposite Somerset House, procured for him by his relation, Lord Clarendon.\r\nHe was buried in the north cloisters of Westminster Abbey, close to his\r\nmaster, Dr. Knipe, to whom he had dedicated his _School Mythology_.\r\n\r\nMr. T. P. Cooke obtained some of his early triumphs at the Lyceum as\r\nFrankenstein, and at the Adelphi as Long Tom Coffin. His serious pantomime\r\nin the fantastic monster of Mrs. Shelley’s novel is said to have been\r\nhighly poetical. He made his début in 1804, at the Royalty Theatre, and\r\nsoon afterwards left Astley’s to join Laurent, the manager of the Lyceum.\r\nThis best of stage seamen since Bannister’s time was born in 1780, and\r\ndied only recently.\r\n\r\nMadame Lucia Elizabeth Vestris had the Lyceum in 1847. This fascinating\r\nactress was the daughter of Francesco Bartolozzi, the engraver, and was\r\nborn in 1797. She married the celebrated dancer, Vestris, in 1813, and in\r\n1813 appeared at the King’s Theatre, in Winter’s opera of “Proserpina.” In\r\n1820, after a wild and disgraceful life in Paris, she appeared at Drury\r\nLane as Lilla, Adela, and Artaxerxes, and exhibited the archness, and\r\nvivacity of Storace without her grossness. In a burlesque of “Don\r\nGiovanni,” as “Paul” and as “Apollo,” she was much abused by the critics\r\nfor her wantonness of manner and dress, but she still won her audiences by\r\nher sweet and powerful contralto, and by her songs, “The Light Guitar” and\r\n“Rise, gentle Moon.” Harley played Leporello to her under Mr. Elliston’s\r\nmanagement. After this she took to “first light comedy” and melodrama, and\r\nmarried Mr. Charles Mathews. The theatre was burnt down in 1830, and\r\nrebuilt soon afterwards. Madame Vestris herself died in 1856.\r\n\r\n“That little crowded nest” of shops and wild beasts,[325] Exeter Change,\r\nstood where Burleigh Street now stands, but extended into the main road,\r\nso that the footpath of the north side of the Strand ran directly through\r\nit.[326] It was built about 1681,[327] and contained two walks below and\r\ntwo walks above stairs, with shops on each side for sempsters, milliners,\r\nhosiers, etc. The builders were very sanguine, but the fame of the New\r\nExchange (now the Adelphi) blighted it from the beginning;[328] the shops\r\nnext the street alone could be let; the rest lay unoccupied. The Land Bank\r\nhad rooms here. The body of the poet Gay lay in state in an upper room,\r\nafterwards used for auctions. In 1721 a Mr. Normand Corry exhibited here a\r\ndamask bed, with curtains woven by himself; admission two shillings and\r\nsixpence. About 1780 Lord Baltimore’s body lay here in state, preparatory\r\nto its interment at Epsom.\r\n\r\nThis infamous lord, of unsavoury reputation, had married a daughter of the\r\nDuke of Bridgewater: he lived on the east side of Russell Square, and was\r\nnotorious for an unscrupulous profligacy, rivalling even that of the\r\ndetestable Colonel Charteris. In 1767 his agents decoyed to his house a\r\nyoung woman named Woodcock, a milliner on Tower Hill. After suffering all\r\nthe cruelty which Lovelace showed to Clarissa, the poor girl was taken to\r\nLord Baltimore’s house at Epsom, where her disgrace was consummated. The\r\nrascal and his accomplices were tried at Kingston in 1768, but\r\nunfortunately acquitted through an informality in Miss Woodcock’s\r\ndeposition. The disgraced title has since become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe last tenants of the upper rooms were Mr. Cross and his wild beasts.\r\nThe Royal Menagerie was a great show in our fathers’ days. Leigh Hunt\r\nmentions that one day at feeding time, passing by the Change, he saw a\r\nfine horse pawing the ground, startled at the roar of Cross’s lions and\r\ntigers.[329] The vast skeleton of Chunee, the famous elephant, brought to\r\nEngland in 1810, and exhibited here, is to be seen at the College of\r\nSurgeons in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. In 1826, after a return of an annual\r\nparoxysm, aggravated by inflammation of the large pulp of one of his\r\ntusks, Chunee became dangerous, and it was necessary to kill him. His\r\nkeeper first threw him buns steeped in prussic acid, but these produced no\r\neffect. A company of soldiers was then sent for, and the monster died\r\nafter upwards of a hundred bullets had pierced him. In the midst of the\r\nshower of lead, the poor docile animal knelt down at the well-known voice\r\nof his keeper, to turn a vulnerable point to the soldiers. At the College\r\nof Surgeons the base of his tusk is still shown, with a spicula of ivory\r\npressing into the pulp.\r\n\r\nDe Loutherbourg, after Garrick’s retirement, left Covent Garden and\r\nexhibited his _Eidophusikon_ in a room over Exeter Change. The stage was\r\nabout six feet wide and eight feet deep. The first scene was the view\r\nfrom One-tree Hill in Greenwich Park. The lamps were above the proscenium,\r\nand had screens of coloured glass which could be rapidly changed. His best\r\nscenes were the loss of the _Halsewell_ East Indiaman and the rising of\r\nPandemonium. A real thunder-storm once breaking out when the shipwreck\r\nscene was going on, some of the audience left the room, saying that “the\r\nexhibition was presumptuous.” Gainsborough was such a passionate admirer\r\nof the _Eidophusikon_ that for a time he spent every evening at\r\nLoutherbourg’s exhibition.[330]\r\n\r\nMr. William Clarke, a seller of hardware (steel buttons, buckles, and\r\ncutlery), was proprietor of Exeter Change for nearly half a century. He\r\nwas an honest and kind man, much beloved by his friends, and known to\r\neverybody in Johnson’s time. When he became infirm he was allowed by King\r\nGeorge the special privilege of riding across St. James’s Park to\r\nBuckingham Gate, his house being in Pimlico. He died rich.\r\n\r\nAnother character of Clarke’s age was old Thomson, a music-seller, and a\r\ngood-natured humourist. He was deputy organist at St. Michael’s, Cornhill,\r\nand had been a pupil of Boyce. His shop was a mere sloping stall, with a\r\nlittle platform behind it for a desk, rows of shelves for old pamphlets\r\nand plays, and a chair or two for a crony. Thomson furnished Burney and\r\nHawkins with materials for their histories of music. It was said that\r\nthere was not an air from the time of Bird that he could not sing. Poor\r\nsoured Wilson used to be fond of sitting with Thomson and railing at the\r\ntimes. Garrick and Dr. Arne also frequented the shop.[331]\r\n\r\nThe nine o’clock drum at old Somerset House and the bell rung as a signal\r\nfor closing Exeter Change were once familiar sounds to old Strand\r\nresidents: but alas! times are changed; and they are heard no more.\r\n\r\nIt was in Thomson’s shop that the elder Dibdin (Charles), together with\r\nHubert Stoppelaer, an actor, singer, and painter, planned the Patagonian\r\nTheatre, which was opened in the rooms above. The stage was six feet wide,\r\nthe puppet actors only ten inches high. Dibdin wrote the pieces, composed\r\nthe music, helped in the recitations, and accompanied the singers on a\r\nsmall organ. His partner spoke for the puppets and painted the scenes.\r\nThey brought out “The Padlock” here. The miniature theatre held about 200\r\npeople.[332]\r\n\r\nExeter Hall was built by Mr. Deering, in 1831, for various charitable and\r\nreligious societies that had scruples about holding their meetings in\r\ntaverns or theatres. It stands a little west of the site of the “old\r\nChange.” The front, with its two massy plain Greek pillars, is a good\r\ninstance of making the most of space, though it still looks as if it were\r\nriding “bodkin” between the larger houses. The building contains two\r\nhalls--one that will hold eight hundred persons, and another, on the upper\r\nfloor, able to hold three thousand. The latter is a noble room, 131 feet\r\nlong by 76 wide, and contains the Sacred Harmonic Society’s gigantic\r\norgan. There are also nests of offices and committee-rooms. In May the\r\nwhite neckcloths pour into Exeter Hall in perfect regiments.\r\n\r\nIn the Strand, near Exeter House, lived the beautiful Countess of\r\nCarlisle, a beauty of Charles I.’s court, immortalised by Vandyke,\r\nSuckling, and Carew. She paid £150 a year rent, equal to £600 of our\r\ncurrent money.[333]\r\n\r\nExeter Street had no western outlet when first built; for where the street\r\nends was the back wall of old Bedford House. Dr. Johnson, after his\r\narrival with Garrick from Lichfield, lodged here, in a garret, at the\r\nhouse of Norris, a staymaker. In this garret Johnson wrote part at least\r\nof that sonorous tragedy, “Irene.” He used to say he dined well and with\r\ngood company for eightpence, at the Pine Apple in the street close by.\r\nSeveral of the guests had travelled. They met every day, but did not know\r\neach other’s names. The others paid a shilling, and had wine. Johnson paid\r\nsixpence for a cut of meat (a penny for bread, a penny to the waiter),\r\nand was served better than the rest, for the waiter that is forgotten is\r\napt also to forget.\r\n\r\nIn Cecil’s time Bedford House became known as Exeter House. From hence, in\r\n1651, Cromwell, the Council of State, and the House of Commons followed\r\nGeneral Popham’s body to its resting-place at Westminster.[334] It was\r\nwhile receiving the sacrament on Christmas Day at the chapel of Exeter\r\nHouse that that excellent gentleman, Evelyn, and his wife were seized by\r\nsoldiers, warned not to observe any longer the “superstitious time of the\r\nNativity,” and dismissed with pity.\r\n\r\nIn Exeter House lived that shifty and unscrupulous turncoat, Antony Ashley\r\nCooper, Earl of Shaftesbury, the great tormentor of Charles II., and the\r\nfather of the author of the _Characteristics_, who was born here 1670-1,\r\nand educated by the amiable philosopher Locke. “The wickedest fellow in my\r\ndominions,” as Charles II. once called “Little Sincerity,” afterwards\r\nremoved hence about the time of the Great Fire to Aldersgate Street, in\r\norder to be near his City intriguers. After the Great Fire, till new\r\noffices could be built, the Court of Arches, the Admiralty Court, etc.,\r\nwere held in Exeter House. The property still belongs to the Cecil family.\r\n\r\nThat great statesman, Burleigh, Bacon’s uncle, lived on the site of the\r\npresent Burleigh Street. He was of birth so humble that his father could\r\nonly be entitled a gentleman by courtesy. Slow but sure of judgment,\r\nsilent, distrustful of brilliant men, such as Essex and Raleigh, he made\r\nhimself, by unremitting skill, assiduity, and fidelity, the most trusted\r\nand powerful person in Queen Elizabeth’s privy council. Here, fresh from\r\nhis frets with the rash Essex, the old wily statesman pondered over the\r\nfate of Mary of Scotland, or strove for means to foil Philip of Spain and\r\nhis Armada. Here also lived his eldest son, Sir Thomas Cecil, subsequently\r\nthe second Lord Burleigh and Earl of Exeter, who died 1622, whose daughter\r\nmarried the heir of Lord Chancellor Hatton, the dancing chancellor.\r\nBurleigh Street replaced the old house in 1678, when Salisbury Street was\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nThe “Little Adelphi” Theatre was opened in 1806 under the name of the\r\n“Sans Souci” by Mr. John Scott, a celebrated colour-maker, famous for a\r\ncertain fashionable blue dye. The entertainments (optical and mechanical)\r\nwere varied by songs, recitations, and dances, the proprietor’s daughter\r\nbeing a clever amateur actress. Its real success did not begin till 1821,\r\nwhen Pierce Egan’s dull and rather vulgar book of London low life, _Tom\r\nand Jerry_, was dramatised--Wrench as Tom, Reeve as Jerry. Subsequently\r\nPower, the best Irishman that trod the boards in London, appeared here in\r\nmelodrama. In 1826 Terry and Yates became joint lessees and managers.\r\nBallantyne and Scott backed up Terry, Sir Walter being always eager for\r\nmoney. Scott eventually had to pay £1750 for the speculative printer; he\r\nseems from the outset to have entertained fears of Terry’s failure.[335]\r\nHere Keely too made his first hit as Jemmy Green.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Mr. Rice, “the original Jim Crow,” was playing at the\r\nAdelphi.[336] This Mr. Rice was an American actor who had studied the\r\ndrolleries of the Negro singers and dancers, especially those of one Jim\r\nCrow, an old boatman who hung about the wharfs of Vicksburg, the same town\r\non the Mississippi that has lately stood so severe a siege. He initiated\r\namong us negro tunes and negro dances. This was the fatal beginning of\r\nthose “negro entertainments,” falsely so called.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 Mr. Mathews gave his first entertainment, “The Mail-coach\r\nAdventures,” at Hull. Mr. James Smith had strung together some sketches of\r\ncharacter, and written for him those two celebrated comic songs, “The Mail\r\nCoach” and “Bartholomew Fair.” In 1818 Mr. Mathews, unfortunately for his\r\npeace of mind, sold himself for seven years to a very sharp practiser, Mr.\r\nArnold, of the Lyceum, for £1000 a year, liable to the deduction of £200\r\nfine for any non-appearance. This becoming unbearable, Mr. Arnold made a\r\nnew agreement, by which he took to himself £40 every night, and shared the\r\nrest with Mr. Mathews, who also paid half the expenses.[337] The shrewd\r\nmanager made £30,000 by this first speculation. Rivalling Mr. Dibdin, the\r\nwonderful mimic appeared in plain evening dress with no other apparent\r\npreparation than a drawing-room scene, a small table covered with a green\r\ncloth, and two lamps. His first entertainment included “Fond Barney, the\r\nYorkshire Idiot” and the “Song of the Royal Visitors,” full of droll\r\nRussian names. In 1819 he produced “The Trip to Paris.” In 1820 he brought\r\nout “The Country Cousins,” with the two celebrated comic songs, “The White\r\nHorse Cellar,” and “O, what a Town!--what a Wonderful Metropolis!” both\r\nfull of the most honest and boisterous fun. In 1821 Peake wrote for him\r\nthe “Polly Packet,” introducing a caricature of Major Thornton, the great\r\nsportsman, as Major Longbow. The entertainment was called “Earth, Air, and\r\nWater,” and contained the song of “The Steam-Boat.”\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Mr. Mathews gave his “Trip to America,” with Yankee songs, negro\r\nimitations, and that fine bit of pathos, “M. Mallet at the Post-Office.”\r\nIn 1825 appeared his “memorandum Book,” and in 1826 his “Invitations,”\r\nwith the “Ruined Yorkshire Gambler (Harry Ardourly),” and “A Civic Water\r\nParty.”\r\n\r\nIn 1828 he opened the Adelphi Theatre in partnership with Mr. Yates,\r\nplaying the drunken Tinker in Mr. Buckstone’s “May Queen,” and singing\r\nthat prince of comic songs, “The Humours of a Country Fair,” written for\r\nhim by his son Charles. Mr. Moncrief wrote his “Spring Meeting for 1829,”\r\nand Mr. Peake his “Comic Annual for 1830.” In 1831 his son Charles aided\r\nMr. Peake in producing an entertainment, and again in 1832. In 1833 his\r\nhealth began to fail; he lost much money in bubble companies, and had an\r\naction brought against him for £30,000. In 1833 Mr. Peake and Mr. Charles\r\nMathews wrote the “At Home.” Subsequently the great mimic went to\r\nAmerica, whence he returned in 1838, only to die a few months after.[338]\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt praises Mr. Mathews’s valets and old men, but condemns his\r\nnervous restlessness and redundance of bodily action. While Munden,\r\nListon, and Fawcett could not conceal their voices, Mathews rivalled\r\nBannister in his powers of mimicry. His delineation of old age was\r\nremarkable for its truthfulness and variety. Leigh Hunt confesses that\r\ntill Mathews acted Sir Fretful Plagiary, he had ranked him as an actor of\r\nhabits and not of passions, and far inferior to Bannister and Dowton; but\r\nthe extraordinary blending of vexation and conceit in Sheridan’s\r\ncaricature of Cumberland proved Mathews, Mr. Hunt allowed, to be an actor\r\nwho knew the human heart.[339]\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Hazlitt criticised Mathews’s third entertainment, “The Country\r\nCousins,” a mélange of songs, narrative, ventriloquism, imitations, and\r\ncharacter stories. He had left Covent Garden on the ground that he had not\r\nsufficiently frequent opportunities for appearing in legitimate comedy.\r\nThe severe critic says, “Mr. Mathews shines particularly neither as an\r\nactor nor a mimic of actors; but his forte is a certain general tact and\r\nversatility of comic power. You would say he is a clever performer--you\r\nwould guess he is a cleverer man. His talents are not pure, but mixed. He\r\nis best when he is his own prompter, manager, performer, orchestra, and\r\nscene-shifter.”[340]\r\n\r\nHazlitt then goes on to accuse his “subject” of a want of taste, of his\r\ngross and often superficial surprises, and of his too restless disquietude\r\nto please. “Take from him,” says Hazlitt, “his odd shuffle in the gait, a\r\nrestless volubility of speech and motion, a sudden suppression of\r\nfeatures, or the continued repetition of a cant phrase with unabated\r\nvigour, and you reduce him to almost total insignificance.” It should be\r\nsaid that his “shuffle” was rather a “limp.”\r\n\r\nAs a mimic of other actors, the same writer says Mathews often failed. He\r\ngabbled like Incledon, entangled himself like Tait Wilkinson, croaked like\r\nSuett, lisped like Young, but he could make nothing of John Kemble’s\r\n“expressive, silver-tongued cadences.” He blames him more especially for\r\nturning nature into pantomime and grimace, and dealing too much with\r\nworn-out topics, like Cockneyisms, French blunders, or the ignorance of\r\ncountry people in stage-coaches, Margate hoys, and Dover packet-boats. In\r\nanother place the severe critic, who could be ill-tempered if he chose,\r\nblames Mathews for many of his songs, for his meagre jokes, dry as\r\nscrapings of “Shabsuger cheese,” and for his immature ventriloquism. “His\r\nbest imitations,” says Hazlitt, “were founded on his own observation, and\r\non the absurd characteristics of chattering footmen, drunken coachmen,\r\nsurly travellers, and garrulous old men. His old Scotchwoman, with her\r\npointless story, was a portrait equal to Wilkie or Teniers, as faithful,\r\nas simple, as delicately humorous, with a slight dash of pathos, but\r\nwithout one particle of caricature, vulgarity, or ill-nature.” His best\r\nbroad jokes were these: the abrupt proposal of a mutton-chop to a man who\r\nwas sea-sick, and the convulsive marks of abhorrence with which he\r\nreceived it; and the tavern beau who was about to swallow a lighted candle\r\nfor a glass of brandy-and-water as he was going drunk to bed. Poor\r\nWiggins, the fat, hen-pecked husband, who, unwieldy and helpless, is\r\npursued by a rabble of boys, was one of his best characters. Hazlitt\r\nmentions also as a stroke of true genius his imitation of a German family,\r\nthe wife grumbling at her husband returning drunk, and the little child’s\r\npaddling across the room to its own bed at its father’s approach.[341]\r\n\r\nTerry, who in 1825 joined partnership with Yates, and died in 1829, was a\r\nquiet, sensible actor, praised in his Mephistopheles, and even in King\r\nLear. His Peter Teazle was inferior to Farren’s, and his Dr. Cantwell came\r\nafter Dowton’s.\r\n\r\nYates was born in 1797. He made his début at Covent Garden as Iago in\r\n1818. He was very versatile, and triumphed alternately in tragedy,\r\ncomedy, farce, and melodrama. A critic of 1834 says, “Mr. Yates is\r\noccasionally capital, and always respectable. In burlesque he is\r\nexcellent, but a little too broad, and given to an exaggeration which is\r\nsometimes vulgar. He is a better buck than fop, and a better rake than\r\neither, were he more refined.”\r\n\r\nJohn Reeve was another of the Adelphi celebrities. He was born in 1799,\r\nand was originally a clerk at a Fleet Street banking-house. He appeared\r\nfirst at Drury Lane in 1819 as Sylvester Daggerwood. His imitations were\r\npronounced perfect, and he soon rose to great celebrity in broad farce,\r\nburlesque, and the comic parts of melodrama. Lord Grizzle, Bombastes, and\r\nPedrillo, were favourite early characters of his. He was considered too\r\nheavy for Caleb Quotem, and not quiet enough for Paul Pry. Liston excelled\r\nhim in the one, and Harley in the other.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Webster was born at Bath in 1800. He took the management of the\r\nHaymarket in 1837, and built the New Adelphi Theatre in 1858. In melodrama\r\nMr. Webster excels. His best parts are--Lavater, Tartuffe, Belphegor,\r\nTriplet, and Pierre Leroux in “The Poor Stroller.” He is excellent in poor\r\nauthors and strolling players, and achieved a great triumph in Mr. Watts\r\nPhilips’s play of “The Dead Heart.” He is energetic and forcible, but he\r\nhas a bad hoarse voice, and he protracts and details his part so\r\nelaborately as often to become tedious.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Madame Celeste, who in 1837 had appeared at Drury Lane on her\r\nreturn from America, was directress of the Adelphi. She then left and took\r\nthe Lyceum, which she held until the close of 1860-1.\r\n\r\nThe old Adelphi closed in June 1858. Although a small and incommodious\r\nhouse, it had long earned a special fame of its own. It began its career\r\nwith “True Blue Scott,” and went on with Rodwell and Jones during the “Tom\r\nand Jerry” mania, when young men about town wrenched off knockers, knocked\r\ndown old men who were paid to apprehend thieves, and attended beggars’\r\nsuppers. Under Terry and Yates, Buckstone and Fitzball produced pieces in\r\nwhich T. P. Cooke, O. Smith, Wilkinson, and Tyrone Power shone (this\r\nactor was drowned in 1841). There also flourished Wright, Paul Bedford,\r\nMrs. Yates, and Mrs. Keeley, in “The Pilot,” “The Flying Dutchman,” “The\r\nWreck Ashore,” “Victorine,” “Rory O’More,” and “Jack Sheppard,”[342]--the\r\nlast of these a play to be branded as a demoralising apotheosis of a\r\nclever thief.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Mr. Webster became proprietor of the Adelphi, and Madame Celeste,\r\na good melodramatic actress, became the directress. Then was brought out\r\nthat crowning triumph of the theatre, “The Green Bushes,” by Mr.\r\nBuckstone--a tremendous success.\r\n\r\nAmong the greatest “hits” at the Adelphi have been of later years Mr.\r\nWatts Philips’s “Dead Heart,” a powerful melodrama of the French\r\nRevolution period, Miss Bateman’s “Leah,” an American-German play of the\r\nold school, and “The Colleen Bawn,” Mr. Boucicault’s clever dramatic\r\nversion of poor Gerald Griffin’s novel, full of fine melodramatic\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nThe old town house of the Earls of Bedford stood on the site of the\r\npresent Southampton Street, and was taken down in 1704, in Queen Anne’s\r\nreign. It was a large house with a courtyard before it, and a spacious\r\ngarden with a terrace walk.[343] Before this house was built the Bedford\r\nfamily lived at the opposite side of the Strand, in the Bishop of\r\nCarlisle’s inn, which, in 1598, was called Russell or Bedford House.[344]\r\nIn 1704 the family removed to Bloomsbury. The neighbouring streets were\r\nchristened by this family. Russell Street bears their family name, and\r\nTavistock Street their second title.\r\n\r\nGarrick lived at No. 36 Southampton Street before he went to the Adelphi.\r\nIn 1755, to give himself some rest, he brought out a magnificent ballet\r\npantomime, called “The Chinese Festival,” composed by “the great Noverre.”\r\nUnfortunately for Garrick, war had just broken out between England and\r\nFrance, and the pit and gallery condemned the Popish dancers in spite of\r\nKing George II. and the quality. Gentlemen in the boxes drew their swords,\r\nleaped down into the pit, and were bruised and beaten. The galleries\r\nlooked on and pelted both sides. The ladies urged fresh recruits against\r\nthe pit, and each fresh levy was mauled. The pit broke up benches, tore\r\ndown hangings, smashed mirrors, split the harpsichords, and storming the\r\nstage, cut and slashed the scenery.[345] The rioters then sallied out to\r\nMr. Garrick’s house (now Eastey’s Hotel) in Southampton Street, and broke\r\nevery window from basement to garret.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oldfield, who lived in Southampton Street, was the daughter of an\r\nofficer, and so reduced as to be obliged to live with a relation who kept\r\nthe Mitre Tavern in St. James’s Market. She was overheard by Mr. Farquhar\r\nreading a comedy, and recommended by him to Sir John Vanbrugh. She was\r\nexcellent as Lady Brute and also as Lady Townley. She died in 1730; her\r\nbody lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and was afterwards buried in\r\nthe Abbey. Lord Hervey and Bubb Doddington supported her pall. Her corpse,\r\nby her own request, was richly adorned with lace--a vanity which Pope\r\nridiculed in those bitter lines--\r\n\r\n  “One would not sure be ugly when one’s dead;\r\n    And, Betty, give this cheek a little red.”\r\n\r\nIn 1712 Arthur Maynwaring, in his will, describes this street as New\r\nSouthampton Street.\r\n\r\nBedford Street was first so named in 1766 by the Paving Commissioners. The\r\nlower part of the street was called Half-Moon Street; after the fire of\r\nLondon it became fashionable with mercers, lacemen, and drapers.[346] The\r\nlower part of the street is in the parish of St. Martin’s in the Fields,\r\nthe upper in that of St. Paul’s, Covent Garden. In the overseers’ accounts\r\nof St. Martin’s mention is made of the names of persons who were fined in\r\n1665 for drinking on the Lord’s Day at the Half-Moon Tavern in this\r\nstreet, also for carrying linen, for shaving customers, for carrying home\r\nvenison or a pair of shoes, and for swearing. Sir Charles Sedley and the\r\nDuke of Buckingham were fined by the Puritans in 1657-58 for riding in\r\ntheir coaches on that day.[347] Ned Ward, the witty publican, in his\r\n_London Spy_, mentions the Half-Moon Tavern in this street.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the same street, in 1645, lived Remigius van\r\nLimput, a Dutch painter, who, at the sale of King Charles’s pictures,\r\nbought Vandyke’s florid masterpiece, now at Windsor, of the king on\r\nhorseback. After the Restoration he was compelled to disgorge it. Had this\r\ngrand picture been the portrait of any better king, Cromwell would not\r\nhave parted with it.\r\n\r\nThe witty bulky Quin lived here from 1749 to 1752. It was in 1749 that\r\nthis great tragedian, reappearing after a retirement, performed in his\r\nfriend Thomson’s posthumous play of “Coriolanus.” Good-natured Quin had\r\nonce rescued the fat lazy poet from a sponging-house. It was about this\r\ntime that the great elocutionist was instructing Prince George in\r\nrecitation. When, afterwards, as king, he delivered his first speech\r\nsuccessfully in Parliament, the actor exclaimed triumphantly, “Sir, it was\r\nI taught the boy.”\r\n\r\nOn the west side, at No. 15, lived Chief “Justice” Richardson, the\r\nhumourist. He died in 1635. The interior of the house is ancient. Sir\r\nFrancis Kynaston, an esquire of the body to Charles I., and author of\r\n_Leoline and Sydanis_, lived in this street in 1637. He died in 1642. The\r\nEarl of Chesterfield, one of Grammont’s gay and heartless gallants, lived\r\nin Bedford Street in 1656. In the same street, in his old age, at the\r\nhouse of his son, a rich silk-mercer, dwelt Kynaston, the great actor of\r\nCharles II.’s time, so well known for his female characters. Thomas\r\nSheridan, the lecturer on elocution, the son of Swift’s friend, and the\r\nfather of the wit and orator, lived in Bedford Street, facing Henrietta\r\nStreet and the south side of Covent Garden. Here Dr. Johnson often visited\r\nhim. “One day,” says Mr. Whyte, “we were standing together at the\r\ndrawing-room window expecting Johnson, who was to dine with us.[348] Mr.\r\nSheridan asked me could I see the length of the garden. ‘No, sir.’ ‘Take\r\nout your opera-glass then: Johnson is coming, you may know him by his\r\ngait.’ I perceived him at a good distance, walking along with a peculiar\r\nsolemnity of deportment, and an awkward, measured sort of step. At that\r\ntime the broad flagging at each side of the streets was not universally\r\nadopted, and stone posts were in fashion to prevent the annoyance of\r\ncarriages. Upon every post, as he passed along, I could observe he\r\ndeliberately laid his hand; but missing one of them, when he had got to\r\nsome distance he seemed suddenly to recollect himself, and immediately\r\nreturning back, carefully performed the accustomed ceremony, and resumed\r\nhis former course, not omitting one, till he gained the crossing. This,\r\nMr. Sheridan assured me, however odd it might appear, was his constant\r\npractice, but why or wherefore he could not inform me.” This eccentric\r\nhabit of Johnson, the result of hypochondriacal nervousness, is also\r\nmentioned by Boswell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXETER CHANGE, 1821.]\r\n\r\nRichard Wilson, the great landscape-painter--“Red-nosed Dick,” as he was\r\nfamiliarly called--was a great ally of Mortimer, “the English Salvator.”\r\nThey used to meet over a pot of porter at the Constitution, Bedford\r\nStreet. Mortimer, who was a coarse joker, used to make Dr. Arne, the\r\ncomposer of “Rule Britannia,” who had a red face and staring eyes, very\r\nangry by telling him that his eyes looked like two oysters just opened for\r\nsauce, and put on an oval side dish of beetroot.\r\n\r\nClose to the Lowther Arcade there is one of those large cafés that are\r\nbecoming features in modern London. It was started by an Italian named\r\nCarlo Gatti. There you may see refugees of all countries, playing at\r\ndominoes, sipping coffee, or groaning over the wrongs of their native land\r\nand their own exile. No music is allowed in this large hall, because it\r\nmight interfere with the week-day services at St. Martin’s Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TITUS OATES IN THE PILLORY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCHARING CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 20, 1864, was laid the first stone of the great Thames Embankment,\r\nwhich now forms the wall of our river from Blackfriars to Westminster. A\r\ncouple of flags fluttered lazily over the stone as a straggling procession\r\nof the members of the Metropolitan Board of Works moved down to the\r\nwooden causeway leading to the river. For two years about a thousand men\r\nwere at work on it night and day. Iron caissons were sunk below the mud,\r\ndeep in the gravel, and within ten feet of the clay which is the real\r\nfoundation of London, and the Victoria Embankment rose gradually into\r\nbeing. It was opened by Royalty in the summer of 1870. This scheme,\r\noriginally sketched out by Wren, was designed by Colonel Trench, M.P., and\r\nalso by Martin the painter; but it was never carried out until the days of\r\nLord Palmerston and the Metropolitan Board of Works. Its piers, its\r\nflights of steps, its broad highway covering a railway, its gardens, its\r\nterraces, are complete; and when the buildings along it are finished\r\nLondon may for the first time claim to compare itself in architectural\r\ngrandeur with Nineveh, Rome, or modern Paris.\r\n\r\nNorthumberland House, which faced Charing Cross, covering the site of\r\nNorthumberland Avenue, was a good but dull specimen of Jacobean\r\narchitecture; it was built by Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, son of\r\nthe poet Earl of Surrey, about 1605.[349] Walpole attributes the building\r\nto Bernard Jansen, a Fleming, and an imitator of Dieterling, and to Gerard\r\nChristmas, the designer of Aldersgate. Jansen probably built the house,\r\nwhich was of brick, and Christmas added the stone frontispiece, which was\r\nprofusely ornamented with rich carved scrolls, and an open parapet worked\r\ninto letters and other devices. John Thorpe is also supposed to have been\r\nassociated in the work; and plans of both the quadrangles of this enormous\r\npalace are preserved among the _Soane MSS._[350] Jansen was the architect\r\nof Audley End, in Essex, one of the wonders of the age. Thorpe built\r\nBurghley. The front was originally 162 feet long, the court 82 feet\r\nsquare; as Inigo Jones has noted in a copy of _Palladio_ preserved at\r\nWorcester College, Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Northampton left the house by his will, in 1614, to his\r\nnephew, Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk, who died in 1626. This was the\r\nfather of the memorable Frances, Countess of Essex and Somerset; and from\r\nhim the house took the name of Suffolk House, till the marriage in 1642 of\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Theophilus, second Earl of Suffolk, with Algernon\r\nPercy, tenth Earl of Northumberland, when it changed its name accordingly.\r\n\r\nDorothy, sister of the rash and ungrateful Earl of Essex, whose violence\r\nand follies nothing less than the executioner’s axe could cure, married\r\nthe “wizard” Earl of Northumberland, as he was called, whom “she led the\r\nlife of a dog, till he indignantly turned her out of doors.” He was\r\nafterwards engaged in the Gunpowder Plot, being angry with the Government\r\nthat had overlooked him. “His name was used and his money spent by the\r\nconspirators; one of his servants hired the vault, and procured the lease\r\nof Vineyard House. Thomas Percy, his kinsman and steward, supped with him\r\non the very night of the plot. His servant, Sir Dudley Carleton, who hired\r\nthe house, was thrust into the Tower, and the earl joined him there not\r\nlong after; but Cecil was either unable or unwilling to touch his\r\nlife.”[351] Northumberland, with Cobham and Raleigh, had before this\r\nengaged in schemes with the French against the Government. Thomas Percy\r\nhad been beheaded for plotting with Mary. Henry Percy had shot himself\r\nwhile in the Tower, on account of the Throckmorton Conspiracy. Compounding\r\nfor a fine of £11,000, the earl devoted himself in the Tower to scientific\r\nand literary pursuits, and gave annuities to six or seven eminent\r\nmathematicians, who ate at his table. In 1611 he was again examined, and\r\nfinally released in 1617. The king’s favourite, Hay, afterwards Earl of\r\nCarlisle, had married the earl’s daughter Lucy against his will, which so\r\nirritated him that he was with difficulty persuaded to accept his own\r\nrelease, because it was obtained through the intercession of Hay.\r\n\r\nJoceline Percy, son of Algernon, dying in 1670, without issue male,\r\nNorthumberland House became the property of his only daughter Elizabeth\r\nPercy, the heiress of the Percy estates. Her first husband was Henry\r\nCavendish, Earl of Ogle; her second, Thomas Thynne, of Longleat, in\r\nWilts, who was shot in his coach in Pall Mall, on Sunday, February 12,\r\n1681-2; her third husband was Charles Seymour, the _proud_ Duke of\r\nSomerset, who married her in 1682. This lady was twice a widow and three\r\ntimes a wife before the age of seventeen.\r\n\r\nThe “proud” duke and duchess lived in great state and magnificence at\r\nNorthumberland House. The duchess died in 1722, and the duke followed in\r\n1748. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Algernon, Earl of Hertford, and\r\nthe seventh Duke of Somerset, who was created Earl of Northumberland in\r\n1749, with remainder, failing issue male, to his son-in-law, Sir Hugh\r\nSmithson, who in 1766 was raised to the dukedom. The lion which country\r\ncousins for two centuries remember to have crowned the central gateway of\r\nthe duke’s house, represented the Percy crest. It is of this stiff-tailed\r\nanimal, for the exact angle of the tail is treated by heralds as a matter\r\nof the most vital importance, that the old story imputed to Sheridan is\r\ntold. Probably some audacious wit did once collect a London crowd by\r\ndeclaring that its tail wagged--but certainly it was not Sheridan.\r\n\r\nTom Thynne, or, as he was called, “Tom of Ten Thousand,” was shot at the\r\neast end of Pall Mall, opposite the Opera Arcade, by Borosky, a Polish\r\nsoldier urged on by Count Königsmark, a Swedish adventurer, son of one of\r\nGustavus’s old generals, and who was enraged with Thynne for having just\r\nmarried the youthful widow of the Earl of Ogle, Lady Elizabeth Percy.\r\nThynne was a favourite of the Duke of Monmouth. Shaftesbury had been\r\nlately released from the Tower, in spite of Dryden’s onslaught on him as\r\n“Achitophel,” on the foolish duke as “Absalom,” and on Thynne as\r\n“Issachar,” his wealthy western friend. The three murderers were hanged in\r\nPall Mall, but their master strangely escaped, partly owing to the\r\ninfluence of Charles II. The count, who had shown great courage at Tangier\r\nagainst the Moors, and had boarded a Turkish galley at his eminent peril,\r\ndied in 1686, at the battle of Argos in the Morea. His younger brother was\r\nassassinated at Hanover, on suspicion of an intrigue with Sophia of Zell,\r\nthe young and beautiful wife of the Elector, afterwards George I. of\r\nEngland.[352]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Northampton, Surrey’s son, who built Northumberland House (as\r\nOsborne, who loved scandal, says with Spanish gold), seems to have been an\r\nunscrupulous time-server, flatterer, and parasite. In 1596 he wrote to\r\nBurleigh, and spoke of his reverend awe at his lordship’s “piercing\r\njudgment;” yet a year after he writes a plotting letter to Burleigh’s\r\ngreat enemy, Essex, and says: “Your lordship by your last purchase hath\r\nalmost enraged the dromedary that would have won the Queen of Sheba’s\r\nfavour by bringing pearls. If you could once be so fortunate in dragging\r\nold Leviathan (Burghley) and his rich tortuosum colubrum (Sir Robert\r\nCecil), as the prophet termeth them, out of their den of mischievous\r\ndevice, the better part of the world would prefer your virtue to that of\r\nHercules.” The earl became a toady and creature of the infamous Carr, Earl\r\nof Somerset, and is thought to have died just in time to escape\r\nprosecution for the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury in the Tower.[353]\r\n\r\nIt was shortly before Suffolk House changed its name that it became the\r\nscene of one of Lord Herbert of Cherbury’s mad Quixotic quarrels. His\r\nchivalrous lordship had had sundry ague fits, which had made him so lean\r\nand yellow that scarce any man could recognise him. Walking towards\r\nWhitehall he one day met a Mr. Emerson, who had spoken very disgraceful\r\nwords of Lord Herbert’s friend, Sir Robert Harley. Lord Herbert therefore,\r\nsensible of the dishonour, took Emerson by his long beard, and then,\r\nstepping aside, drew his sword; Captain Thomas Scriven being with Lord\r\nHerbert, and divers friends with Mr. Emerson. All who saw the quarrel\r\nwondered at the Welsh nobleman, weak and “consumed” as he was, offering to\r\nfight; however, Emerson ran and took shelter in Suffolk House, and\r\nafterwards complained to the Lords in Council, who sent for Lord Herbert,\r\nthe lean, yellow Welsh Quixote, but did not so much reprehend him for\r\ndefending the honour of his friend as for adventuring to fight, being at\r\nthe same time in such weak health.[354]\r\n\r\nAlgernon, the tenth Earl of Northumberland, is called by Clarendon “the\r\nproudest man alive.” He had been Lord High Admiral to King Charles I., and\r\nwas appointed general against the Scotch Covenanters, but, being unable to\r\ntake the command from ill health, gave up his commission. He gradually\r\nfell away from the king’s cause, but nevertheless refused to continue High\r\nAdmiral against the king’s wish. He treated the Dukes of York and\r\nGloucester and the Princess Elizabeth with “such consideration” that they\r\nwere removed from his care, and from that time he turned Royalist again.\r\n\r\nSir John Suckling refers to Suffolk House in his exquisite little poem on\r\nthe wedding of Roger Boyle, Lord Broghill, with Lady Margaret Howard,\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Suffolk. The well known poem begins--\r\n\r\n  “At Charing-cross, hard by the way\r\n  Where we (thou know’st) do sell our hay,\r\n    There is a house with stairs.”\r\n\r\nAnd then the gay and graceful poet goes on to sketch Lady Margaret--\r\n\r\n  “Her lips were red, and one was thin,\r\n  Compared with that was next her chin.\r\n    Some bee had stung it newly.”\r\n\r\nAnd then follows that delightful, fantastic simile, comparing her feet to\r\nlittle mice creeping in and out her petticoat.[355] Sir John was born in\r\n1609.\r\n\r\nThe oldest part of Northumberland House was the Strand entrance. This was\r\ncrowned, as stated above, by a frieze or balustrade of large stone\r\nletters, probably including the name and titles of the earl and the\r\nglorified name of the architect. At the funeral of Anne of Denmark, 1619,\r\na young man, named Appleyard, was killed by the fall of the letter S[356]\r\nfrom the house, which was then occupied by the Earl of Strafford, Lord\r\nTreasurer. The house was originally only three sides of a quadrangle, the\r\nriver side remaining open to the gardens; but traffic and noise\r\nincreasing, the quadrangle was completed along the river side and the\r\nprincipal apartments. There is a drawing by Hollar of the house in his\r\ntime, and another, a century later, by Canaletti. The new front towards\r\nthe gardens was spoiled by a clumsy stone staircase, which was attributed\r\nto Inigo Jones, but probably incorrectly.\r\n\r\nThe date, 1746, on the façade referred to the repairs made in that year,\r\nand the letters “A. S. P. N.” stood for Algernon Somerset, Princeps\r\nNorthumbriæ. The lion over the gateway was said to be a copy of one by\r\nMichael Angelo; it is now at Sion House, Isleworth. The gateway was\r\ncovered with ornaments and trophies. Double ranges of grotesque pilasters\r\nenclosed eight niches on the sides, and there was a bow window and an open\r\narch above the chief gate. Between each of the fourteen niches in the\r\nfront there were trophies of crossed weapons, and the upper stories had\r\ntwenty-four windows, in two ranges, and pierced battlements. Each wing\r\nterminated in a little cupola, and the angles had rustic quoins. The\r\nquadrangle within the gate was simpler and in better taste, and the house\r\nwas screened from the river by elm trees.[357]\r\n\r\nThere used to be a schoolboy tradition, prevalent at King’s College in the\r\nauthor’s time, that one of the niches in the front of Northumberland House\r\nwas of copper and movable. So far the story was true; but the tradition\r\nwent on to relate how, once upon a time, a certain enemy of the house of\r\nPercy obtained secret admission by this niche and murdered one of the\r\ndukes, his enemy. History is, however, fortunately, quite silent on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn February 1762 Horace Walpole and a party of quality set out from\r\nNorthumberland House to hear the ghost in Cock Lane that Dr. Johnson\r\nexposed, and that Hogarth and Churchill ridiculed with pen and pencil.\r\nThe Duke of York, Lady Northumberland, Lady Mary Coke, and Lord Hertford,\r\nall returned from the Opera with Horace Walpole, then changed their dress,\r\nand set out in a hackney coach. It rained hard, and the lane and house\r\nwere “full of mob.” The room of the haunted house, small and miserable,\r\nwas stuffed with eighty persons, and there was no light but one tallow\r\ncandle. As clothes-lines hung from the ceiling, Walpole asked drily if\r\nthere was going to be rope-dancing between the acts. They said the ghost\r\nwould not come till 7 A.M., when only ’prentices and old women remained.\r\nThe party stayed till half-past one. The Methodists had promised\r\ncontributions, provisions were sent in like forage, and the neighbouring\r\ntaverns and ale-houses were making their fortunes.[358]\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 1770, poor Chatterton, who suffered so terribly for the\r\ndeceptions of his ambitious boyhood, writes from the King’s Bench (for the\r\npresent) that a gentleman who knew him at the Chapter coffee-house, in\r\nPaternoster Row--frequented by authors and publishers--would have\r\nintroduced him to the young Duke of Northumberland as a companion in his\r\nintended general tour, “but, alas! I spake no tongue but my own.”[359] But\r\nthis is taken from a most questionable work, full of fictions and\r\nforgeries. Its author was a Bristol man, who afterwards fled to America.\r\nHe also wrote a series of Conversations with the poets of the Lake school,\r\nmany of which are too obviously imaginary.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 1780, the Strand front of Northumberland House was totally\r\ndestroyed by fire. The apartments of Dr. Percy, the Duke’s kinsman and\r\nchaplain, afterwards Bishop of Dromore and editor of the _Reliques of\r\nAncient Poetry_ were consumed; but great part of his library escaped.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith’s simple-hearted ballad of _Edwin and Angelina_ was originally\r\n“printed for the amusement of the Countess of Northumberland.” Two years\r\nafter, Kenrick accused him in the papers of plagiarising it from Percy’s\r\npasticcio from Shakspere in the _Reliques_, which was probably written in\r\n1765.[360]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Goldsmith often visited Percy, when acting as chaplain\r\nat Northumberland House. Sir John Hawkins, indeed, describes meeting the\r\npoet waiting for an audience in an outer room. At his own audience Hawkins\r\nmentioned that the doctor was waiting. On their way home together,\r\nGoldsmith told Hawkins that his lordship said that he had read the\r\n_Traveller_ with delight, that he was going as Lord Lieutenant to Ireland,\r\nand should be glad, as Goldsmith was an Irishman, to do him any kindness.\r\nHawkins was enraptured at the rich man’s graciousness. But Goldsmith had\r\nmentioned only his brother, a clergyman there, who needed help. “As for\r\nmyself,” he added, bitterly, “I have no dependence on the promises of\r\ngreat men. I look to the booksellers for support; they are my best\r\nfriends, and I am not inclined to forsake them for others.” “Thus,” says\r\nHawkins, “did this idiot in the affairs of the world trifle with his\r\nfortunes and put back the hand that was held out to assist him.” The earl\r\ntold Percy, after Goldsmith’s death, that had he known how to help the\r\npoet he would have done so, or he would have procured him a salary on the\r\nIrish establishment that would have allowed him to travel. Let men of the\r\nworld remember that the poet a few days before had been forced to borrow\r\n15s. 6d. to meet his own wants.\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place in 1765. In 1771, when Goldsmith was stopping\r\nat Bath with his good-natured friend Lord Clare, he blundered by mistake\r\nat breakfast time into the next door on the same Parade, where the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Northumberland were staying. As he took no notice of them,\r\nbut threw himself carelessly on a sofa, they supposed there was some\r\nmistake, and therefore entered into conversation with him, and when\r\nbreakfast was served up, invited him to stay and partake of it. The poet,\r\nhot, stammering, and irrecoverably confused, withdrew with profuse\r\napologies for his mistake, but not till he had accepted an invitation to\r\ndinner. This story, a parallel to the laughable blunder in _She Stoops to\r\nConquer_, was told by the duchess herself to Dr. Percy.\r\n\r\nIt was probably of the first of these interviews that Goldsmith used to\r\ngive the following account:--\r\n\r\n“I dressed myself in the best manner I could, and, after studying some\r\ncompliments I thought necessary on such an occasion, proceeded to\r\nNorthumberland House, and acquainted the servants that I had particular\r\nbusiness with the duke. They showed me into an ante-chamber, where, after\r\nwaiting some time, a gentleman, very elegantly dressed, made his\r\nappearance. Taking him for the duke, I delivered all the fine things I had\r\ncomposed, in order to compliment him on the honour he had done me; when to\r\nmy fear and astonishment, he told me I had mistaken him for his master,\r\nwho would see me immediately. At that instant the duke came into the\r\napartment, and I was so confounded on the occasion that I wanted words\r\nbarely sufficient to express the sense I entertained of the duke’s\r\npoliteness, and went away exceedingly chagrined at the blunder I had\r\ncommitted.”[361]\r\n\r\nDr. Waagen, the picture critic, seems to have been rather dazzled at the\r\nsplendour of Northumberland House. He praises the magnificent staircase,\r\nlighted from above and reaching up through three stories, the white marble\r\nfloors, the balustrades and chandeliers of gilt bronze, the cabinets of\r\nFlorentine mosaic, and the arabesques of the drawing-room.[362] The great\r\npicture of the duke’s collection was the Cornaro family, by Titian; I\r\nbelieve from the Duke of Buckingham’s collection. It is a splendid\r\nspecimen of the painter’s middle period and golden tone. The faces of the\r\nkneeling Cornari are grand, simple, senatorial, and devout. There was also\r\na Saint Sebastian, by Guercino, “clear and careful,” and large as life; a\r\nfine Snyders and Vandyke; many copies by Mengs (particularly “The School\r\nof Athens”); and a good Schalcken, with his usual candlelight effect. The\r\ngem of all the English pictures was one by Dobson, Vandyke’s noble pupil.\r\nIt contained the portrait of the painter and those of Sir Balthasar\r\nGerbier, the architect, and Sir Charles Cotterell. The colour is as rich\r\nand juicy as Titian’s, the drapery learned and graceful, the faces are\r\nfull of fire and spirit. Dobson died at the age of thirty-six. Sir Charles\r\nwas his patron.[363] Vandyke is said to have disinterred Dobson from a\r\ngarret, and recommended him to the king. Gerbier was a native of Antwerp,\r\na painter, architect, and ambassador. This picture of Dobson was bought at\r\nBetterton’s sale for £44.[364] The gallery of the Duke of Northumberland\r\nwas removed in 1875, when the house was demolished, to Sion House.\r\n\r\nNorthumberland House was connected with, at all events, one period of\r\nEnglish history. In the year 1660, when General Monk was in quarters at\r\nWhitehall, the Earl of Northumberland, in the name of the nobility and\r\ngentry of England, invited him here to the first conference in which the\r\nrestoration of the Stuarts was publicly talked of. Algernon Percy, the\r\ntenth earl, had been Lord High Admiral under Charles I.\r\n\r\nThat staunch, brave, crotchety man, Sir Harry Vane the younger (the son of\r\nLord Strafford’s enemy), lived next door to Northumberland House,\r\neastwards, in the Strand. The house in Charles II.’s time became the\r\nofficial residence of the Secretary of State, and Mr. Secretary Nicholas\r\ndwelt there, when meetings were held to found a commonwealth and put down\r\nthat foolish, good-natured, incompetent Richard Cromwell. To the great\r\nProtector, Vane was a thorn in the flesh, for he wanted a republic when\r\nthe nation required a stronger and more compact government. Oliver’s\r\nexclamation, “Oh, Sir Harry Vane! Sir Harry Vane!--The Lord deliver me\r\nfrom Sir Harry Vane!” expresses infinite vexation with an impracticable\r\nperson. Vane was a “Fifth-monarchy man,” and believed in universal\r\nsalvation. He must have been a good man, or Milton would never have\r\naddressed the sonnet to him in which he says--\r\n\r\n  “Therefore, on thy firm hand Religion leans\r\n  In peace, and reckons thee her eldest son.”\r\n\r\nSir Harry left behind him some very tough and dark treatises on prophecy,\r\nand other profound matters that few but angels or fools dare to meddle\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThere is a foolish tradition that Charing Cross was so named originally by\r\nEdward I. in memory of his _chère reine_. Peele, one of the glorious band\r\nof Elizabethan dramatists, helped to spread this tradition. He makes King\r\nEdward say--\r\n\r\n  “Erect a rich and stately carved cross,\r\n  Whereon her statue shall with glory shine;\r\n  And henceforth see you call it Charing Cross.\r\n  For why?--the _chariest_ and the choicest queen\r\n  That ever did delight my royal eyes\r\n  There dwells in darkness.”[365]\r\n\r\nThe inconsolable widower, however, in spite of his costly grief, soon\r\nmarried again.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, there are in England one or two Charings; one of them is a\r\nvillage thirteen miles from Maidstone. “_Ing_” means meadow in Saxon.[366]\r\nThe meaning of “_Char_” is uncertain; it may be the contraction of the\r\nname of some long-forgotten landowner, “rich in the possession of\r\ndirt.”[367] The Anglo-Saxon word _cerre_--a turn (says Mr. Robert\r\nFerguson, an excellent authority), is retained in the name given in\r\nCarlisle and other northern towns to the chares, or _wynds_--small\r\nstreets. In King Edward’s time Charing was bounded by fields, both north\r\nand west. There has been a good deal of nonsense, however, written about\r\n“the pleasant village of Charing.” In Aggas’s map, published under\r\nElizabeth, Hedge Lane (now Whitcombe Street) is a country lane bordered\r\nwith fields; so is the Haymarket, and all behind the Mews up to St.\r\nMartin’s Lane is equally rural.\r\n\r\nHorne Tooke[368] derives the word Charing from the Saxon verb _charan_--to\r\nturn; but the etymology is still doubtful, however much the river may bend\r\non its way to Westminster. However, doubtless, the place was named\r\nCharing as far back as the Saxon times.\r\n\r\nIt was Peele also who kept alive the old tradition of Queen Eleanor\r\nsinking at Charing Cross and rising again at Queenhithe. When falsely\r\naccused of _her crimes_, his heroine replies in the words of a rude old\r\nballad well known in Elizabeth’s time--\r\n\r\n  “If that upon so vile a thing\r\n    Her heart did ever think,\r\n  She wished the ground might open wide,\r\n    And therein she might sink.\r\n\r\n  With that at Charing Cross she sank\r\n    Into the ground alive,\r\n  And after rose with life again,\r\n    In London at Queenhithe.”[369]\r\n\r\nThe Eleanor crosses were erected at Lincoln, Geddington, Northampton,\r\nStony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St. Albans, Waltham, Cheap, and\r\nCharing. Three only now remain,--Northampton, Geddington, and Waltham.\r\nCharing Cross was probably the most costly; it was octagonal, and was\r\nadorned with statues in tiers of niches, which were crowned with\r\npinnacles. It was begun by Master Richard de Crundale, “cementarius,” but\r\nhe died about 1293, before it was finished, and the work went on under the\r\nsupervision of Roger de Crundale. Richard received about £500 for his\r\nwork, exclusive of materials furnished him, and Roger £90: 7: 5. The stone\r\nwas brought from Caen, and the marble steps from Corfe in Dorsetshire.\r\nOnly one foreigner was employed on all the crosses, and he was a\r\nFrenchman. The Abbot Ware brought mosaics, porphyry, and perhaps designs\r\nfrom Italy, but there is no proof that he brought over Cavallini. A\r\nreplica of the original cross, designed by Mr. Barry, has been erected at\r\nthe west end of the Strand, opposite the Charing Cross Railway Station and\r\nHotel.\r\n\r\nThe cluster of houses at Charing acquired the name of Cross from the\r\nmonument set up by Edward I. to the memory of his gentle, pious, and\r\nbrave wife Eleanor, the sister of Alphonso, King of Castille. This good\r\nwoman was the daughter of Ferdinand III., and after the death of her\r\nmother, heiress of Ponthieu. She bore to her fond husband four sons and\r\neleven daughters, of whom only three are supposed to have survived their\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nQueen Eleanor died at Hardley, near Lincoln, in 1290. The king followed\r\nthe funeral to Westminster, and afterwards erected a cross to his wife’s\r\nmemory at every place where the corpse rested for the night. In the\r\ncircular which the king sent on the occasion to his prelates and nobles,\r\nhe trusts that prayers may be offered for her soul at these crosses, so\r\nthat any stains not purged from her, either from forgetfulness or other\r\ncauses, may through the plenitude of the Divine grace be removed.[370] It\r\nwas Queen Eleanor who, when Edward was stabbed at Acre, by an emissary of\r\nthe Emir of Joppa, according to a Spanish historian,[371] sucked the\r\npoison from the wounds at the risk of her own life.\r\n\r\nThis warlike king, who subdued Wales and Scotland, who expelled the Jews\r\nfrom England, who hunted Bruce, hanged Wallace, and who finally died on\r\nhis march to crush Scotland, had a deep affection for his wife, and strove\r\nby all that art could do to preserve her memory.\r\n\r\nOld Charing Cross was long supposed to have been built from the designs of\r\nPietro Cavallini, a contemporary of Giotto. He is said to have assisted\r\nthat painter in the great mosaic picture over the chief entrance of St.\r\nPeter’s. But there is little ground for accepting the tradition as true,\r\nthough asserted by Vertue, as we learn from Horace Walpole’s ‘Anecdotes.’\r\nCavallini was born in 1279, and died in 1364. The monument to Henry III.\r\nat the Abbey, and the old paintings round the chapel of St. Edward are\r\nalso attributed to this patriarch of art by Vertue.[372]\r\n\r\nQueen Eleanor had three tombs--one in Lincoln Cathedral, over her viscera;\r\nanother in the church of the Blackfriars in London, over her heart; a\r\nthird in Westminster Abbey, over the rest of her body. The first was\r\ndestroyed by the Parliamentarians; the second probably perished at the\r\ndissolution of the monasteries; the third has escaped. It is a valuable\r\nexample of the thirteenth century beau-ideal. The tomb was the work of\r\nWilliam Torel, a London goldsmith. The statue is not a portrait statue any\r\nmore than the statue of Henry III. by the same artist. Torel seems to have\r\nreceived for his whole work about £1700 of our money.[373]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful cross, with its pinnacles and statues, was demolished in\r\n1647 under an order of the House of Commons, which had remained dormant\r\nfor three years; and at the same time fell its brother cross in Cheapside.\r\n\r\nThe Royalist ballad-mongers, eager to catch the Puritans tripping,\r\nproduced a lively street song on the occasion, beginning--\r\n\r\n  “Undone, undone the lawyers are,\r\n    They wander about the town,\r\n  Nor can find the way to Westminster,\r\n    Now Charing Cross is down.\r\n  At the end of the Strand they make a stand,\r\n    Swearing they are at a loss,\r\n  And chaffing say that’s not the way,\r\n    They must go by Charing Cross.”\r\n\r\nThe ballad-writer goes on to deny that the Cross ever spoke a word against\r\nthe Parliament, though he confesses it might have inclined to Popery; for\r\ncertain it was that it “never went to church.”\r\n\r\nThe workmen were engaged for three months in pulling down the Cross.[374]\r\nSome of the stones went to form the pavement before Whitehall; others were\r\npolished to look like marble, and were sold to antiquaries for\r\nknife-handles. The site remained vacant for thirty-one years.\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration Charing Cross was turned into a place of execution.\r\nHere Hugh Peters, Cromwell’s chaplain, and Major-General Harrison, the\r\nsturdy Anabaptist, Colonel Jones, and Colonel Scrope were executed. They\r\nall died bravely, without a doubt or a fear.\r\n\r\nHarrison was the son of a Staffordshire farmer, and had fought bravely at\r\nthe siege of Basing; he had been major-general in Scotland; had helped\r\nCromwell at the disbanding of the Rump; had served in the Council of\r\nState; and finally having expressed honest Anabaptist scruples about the\r\nProtectorate, had been imprisoned to prevent rebellion. Cromwell’s son\r\nOliver had been captain in Harrison’s regiment.[375] As he was led to the\r\nscaffold some base scullion called out to the brave old Ironside, “Where\r\nis your good _old_ cause now?” Harrison replied with a cheerful smile,\r\nclapping his hand on his breast, “Here it is, and I am going to seal it\r\nwith my blood.” When he came in sight of the gallows he was transported\r\nwith joy; his servant asked him how he did? He answered, “Never better in\r\nmy life.” His servant told him, “Sir, there is a crown of glory prepared\r\nfor you.”[376] “Yes,” replied he, “I see.” When he was taken off the\r\nsledge, the hangman desired him to forgive him. “I do forgive thee,” said\r\nhe, “with all my heart, as it is a sin against me,” and told him he wished\r\nhim all happiness; and further said, “Alas, poor man, thou dost it\r\nignorantly; the Lord grant that this sin may not be laid to thy charge!”\r\nand putting his hand into his pocket he gave him all the money he had; and\r\nso parting with his servant, hugging him in his arms, he went up the\r\nladder with an undaunted countenance. The cruel rabble observing him\r\ntremble in his hands and legs, he took notice of it, and said, “Gentlemen,\r\nby reason of some scoffing that I do hear, I judge that some do think I am\r\nafraid to die by the shaking I have in my hands and knees. I tell you\r\n_No_; but it is by reason of much blood I have lost in the wars, and many\r\nwounds I have received in my body, which caused this shaking and weakness\r\nin my nerves. I have had it this twelve years. I speak this to the praise\r\nand glory of God. He hath carried me above the fear of death, and I value\r\nnot my life, because I go to my Father, and I am assured I shall take it\r\nagain. Gentlemen, take notice, that for being an instrument in that cause\r\n(an instrument of the Son of God) which hath been pleaded amongst us, and\r\nwhich God hath witnessed to by many appeals and wonderful victories, I am\r\nbrought to this place to suffer death this day, and if I had ten thousand\r\nlives I could freely and cheerfully lay them down all to witness to this\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\nThen he prayed to himself with tears, and having ended, the hangman pulled\r\ndown his cap, but he thrust it up and said, “I have one word more to the\r\nLord’s people. Let them not think hardly of any of the good ways of God\r\nfor all this, for I have found the way of God to be a perfect way, and He\r\nhath covered my head many times in the day of battle. By my God I have\r\nleaped over a wall, by my God I have run through a troop, and by my God I\r\nwill go through this death, and He will make it easy to me. Now, into thy\r\nhands, O Lord Jesus, I commit my spirit.”\r\n\r\nAfter he was hanged they cut down this true martyr, and stripping him,\r\nslashed him open in order to disembowel him. In the last rigour of his\r\nagony this staunch soldier is said to have risen up and struck the\r\nexecutioner.\r\n\r\nThree days after, Carew and Cook were hanged at the same place, rejoicing\r\nand praying cheerfully to the last. As Cook parted from his wife he said\r\nto her, “I am going to be married in glory this day. Why weepest\r\nthou?--let them weep who part and shall never meet again.”\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, Thomas Scot perished at the same place. His last words\r\nwere--“God engaged me in a cause not to be repented of--I say, in a cause\r\nnot to be repented of.”\r\n\r\nJones and Scrope (both old men) were drawn in one sledge. Their grave yet\r\ncheerful and courageous countenances caused great admiration and\r\ncompassion among the crowd. Observing one of his friend’s children weeping\r\nat Newgate, Colonel Jones took her by the hand. He said, “Suppose your\r\nfather were to-morrow to be King of France, and you were to tarry a little\r\nbehind, would you weep so? Why, he is going to reign with the King of\r\nkings.” When he saw the sledge, he said, “It is like Elijah’s fiery\r\nchariot, only it goes through Fleet Street.” The night before he suffered,\r\nhe told a friend the only temptation he had was lest he should be too much\r\ntransported, and so neglect and slight his life, so greatly was he\r\nsatisfied to die in such a cause. Another friend he grasped in his arms\r\nand said, “Farewell! I could wish thee in the same condition as myself,\r\nthat our souls might mount up to heaven together and share in eternal\r\njoys.” To another friend he said, “Ah, dear heart! if we had perished\r\ntogether in that storm going to Ireland, we had been in heaven to welcome\r\nhonest Harrison and Carew; but we will be content to go after them--we\r\nwill go after.” It is added that “the executioner, having done his part\r\nupon three others that day, was so surfeited with blood and sick, that he\r\nsent his boy to finish the tragedy on Colonel Jones.”\r\n\r\nHugh Peters was much afraid while in Newgate lest his spirits should fail\r\nhim when he saw the gibbet and the fire, but his courage did not fail him\r\nin that hour of great need. On his way to execution he looked about and\r\nespied a man to whom he gave a piece of gold, having bowed it first, and\r\ndesired him to carry that as a token to his daughter, and to let her know\r\nthat her father’s heart was as full of comfort as it could be, and that\r\nbefore the piece should come into her hands he should be with God in\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nWhile Cook was being hanged they made Peters sit within the rails to\r\nbehold his death. While sitting thus, one came to him and upbraided the\r\nold preacher with the king’s death, and bade him repent. Peters replied,\r\n“Friend, you do not well to trample upon a dying man: you are greatly\r\nmistaken--I had nothing to do in the death of the king.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Cook was cut down and about to be quartered, Colonel Turner told\r\nthe sheriff’s men to bring Mr. Peters nearer to see the body. By and by\r\nthe hangman came to him, rubbing his bloody hands, and tauntingly asked\r\nhim, “Come, how do you like this--how do you like this work?” To whom Mr.\r\nPeters calmly replied, “I am not, I thank God, terrified at it--you may do\r\nyour worst.”\r\n\r\nBeing upon the ladder, he spoke to the sheriff and said, “Sir, you have\r\nhere slain one of the servants of God before mine eyes, and have made me\r\nto behold it on purpose to terrify and discourage me, but God hath made it\r\nan ordinance to me for my strengthening and encouragement.”\r\n\r\nWhen he was going to die, he said, “What, flesh! art thou unwilling to go\r\nto God through the fire and jaws of death? Oh! this is a good day. He is\r\ncome that I have long looked for, and I shall soon be with Him in glory.”\r\nAnd he smiled when he went away. “What Mr. Peters said further it could\r\nnot be taken, in regard his voice was low at the time and the people\r\nuncivil.”\r\n\r\nIn May 1685 that consummate scoundrel Titus Oates came to the pillory at\r\nCharing Cross. He had been condemned to pay a thousand marks fine, to be\r\nstripped of his gown, to be whipped from Newgate to Tyburn, from Aldgate\r\nto Newgate, and to stand in the pillory at the Royal Exchange and before\r\nWestminster Hall. He was also condemned to stand one hour in the pillory\r\nat Charing Cross every 10th of August, and there an eye-witness describes\r\nseeing him in 1688.[377]\r\n\r\nIn 1666 and 1667 an Italian puppet-player set up his booth at Charing\r\nCross, and there and then probably introduced “Punch and Judy” into\r\nEngland. He paid a small rent to the overseers of St. Martin’s parish, and\r\nis called in their books “Punchinello.” In 1668 we learn that a Mr. Devone\r\nerected a small playhouse in the same place.[378]\r\n\r\nThere is still extant a song written to ridicule the long delay in setting\r\nup the king’s statue, and it contains an allusion to “Punch”--\r\n\r\n  “What can the mistry be, why Charing Cross\r\n    These five months continues still blinded with board?\r\n  Dear Wheeler, impart--wee are all att a loss,\r\n    Unless Punchinello is to be restored.”[379]\r\n\r\nThe royal statue at Charing Cross is the work of Hubert Le Sœur, a\r\nFrenchman and a pupil of the famous John of Bologna, the sculptor of the\r\n“Rape of the Sabines” in the Loggia at Florence. Le Sœur’s copy of the\r\n“Fighting Gladiator,” which is praised by Peacham in his “Compleat\r\nGentleman,” once at the head of the canal in St. James’s Park, is now at\r\nHampton Court. Le Sœur also executed the monuments of Sir George Villiers,\r\nand Sir Thomas Richardson the judge, in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe original contract for the brazen equestrian statue, a foot larger than\r\nlife, is dated 1630. The sculptor was to receive £600. The agreement was\r\ndrawn up by Sir Balthasar Gerbier for the purchaser, the Lord High\r\nTreasurer Weston. Yet the existing statue was not cast till 1633, and the\r\nabove-mentioned agreement speaks of it as to be erected in the Lord\r\nTreasurer’s garden at Roehampton; so that the agreement may not refer to\r\nthe same work, although it certainly specifies that the sculptor shall\r\n“take advice of his Maj. riders of greate horses, as well for the shape of\r\nthe horse and action as for the graceful shape and action of his Maj.\r\nfigure on the same.”[380]\r\n\r\nThe present statue was cast in 1633, on a piece of ground near the church\r\nin Covent Garden, and not being actually erected when the Civil War broke\r\nout, it was sold by the Parliament to John Rivet, a brazier, living at\r\n“the Dial, near Holburn Conduit,” with strict orders to break it up. But\r\nthe man, being a shrewd Royalist, produced some fragments of old brass,\r\nand hid the statue underground till the Restoration. Rivet refusing to\r\ndeliver up the statue after Charles’s return, a replevin was served upon\r\nhim to compel its surrender. The dispute, however, lasted many years, and\r\nhe probably pleaded compensation. The statue was erected in its present\r\nposition about 1674, by an order from the Earl of Danby, afterwards Duke\r\nof Leeds. Le Sœur died, it is supposed, before the statue was erected.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, who praises the “commanding grace of the figure,” and the\r\n“exquisite form of the horse,”[381] incorrectly says, “The statue was made\r\nat the expense of the family of Howard, Lord Arundel, who have still the\r\nreceipt to show by whom and for whom it was cast.”\r\n\r\nThere is still extant a very rare large sheet print of the statue,\r\nengraved in the manner and time of Faithorne, but without name or date.\r\nThe inscription beneath it describes the statue as almost ten feet high,\r\nand as “preserved underground,” with great hazard, charge, and care, by\r\nJohn Rivet, a brazier.[382]\r\n\r\nJohn Rivet may have been a patriot, but he was certainly a shrewd one. To\r\nsecure his concealed treasure he had manufactured a large quantity of\r\nbrass handles for knives and forks, and advertised them as being forged\r\nfrom the destroyed statue. They sold well; the Royalists bought them as\r\nsad and precious relics; the Puritans as mementos of their triumph. He\r\ndoubled his prices, and still his shop was crowded with eager customers,\r\nso that in a short time he realised a considerable fortune.[383]\r\n\r\nThe brazier, or the brazier’s family, probably sold the statue to Charles\r\nII. at his restoration. The Parliament voted £70,000 for solemnising the\r\nfuneral of Charles I., and for erecting a monument to his memory.[384]\r\nPart of this sum went for the pedestal, but whether the brazier or his kin\r\nwere rewarded is not known. Charles II. probably spent most of the money\r\non his pleasures.\r\n\r\nThere is a fatality attending the verses of most time-serving poets.\r\nWaller never wrote a court poem well but when he lauded that great man,\r\nthe Protector. When the statue of “the Martyr” was set up, _fourteen\r\nyears_ after the Restoration--so tardy was filial affection--Waller wrote\r\nthe following dull and unworthy lines about the statue of a faithless\r\nking:--\r\n\r\n  “That the first Charles does here in triumph ride,\r\n  See his son reign where he a martyr died,\r\n  And people pay that reverence as they pass\r\n  (Which then he wanted) to the sacred brass\r\n  Is not th’ effect of gratitude alone,\r\n  To which we owe the statue and the stone;\r\n  But Heaven this lasting monument has wrought,\r\n  That mortals may eternally be taught\r\n  Rebellion, though successful, is but vain,\r\n  And kings so kill’d rise conquerors again.\r\n  This truth the royal image does proclaim\r\n  Loud as the trumpet of surviving fame.”\r\n\r\nAndrew Marvell, one of the most powerful of lampoon writers, and the very\r\nGillray of political satirists, wrote some bitter lines on the statue of\r\nthe so-called Martyr at Charing Cross, lines which in an earlier reign\r\nwould have cost the honest daring poet his ears, if not his head.\r\n\r\nThere was an equestrian stone statue of Charles II. at Woolchurch\r\n(Woolwich?), and the poet imagines the two horses, the one of stone and\r\nthe other of brass, talking together one evening, when the two riders,\r\nweary of sitting all day, had stolen away together for a chat.\r\n\r\n  “WOOLCHURCH.--To see Dei gratia writ on the throne,\r\n                         And the king’s wicked life says God there is none.\r\n\r\n     CHARING.--That he should be styled Defender of the Faith\r\n                        Who believes not a word what the Word of God saith.\r\n\r\n  WOOLCHURCH.--That the Duke should turn Papist and that church defy\r\n                        For which his own father a martyr did die.\r\n\r\n     CHARING.--Tho’ he changed his religion, I hope he’s so civil\r\n                        Not to think his own father has gone to the devil.”\r\n\r\nUpon the brazen horse being asked his opinion of the Duke of York, it\r\nreplies with terrible truth and force:--\r\n\r\n  “The same that the frogs had of Jupiter’s stork.\r\n  With the Turk in his head and the Pope in his heart,\r\n  Father Patrick’s disciple will make England smart.\r\n  If e’er he be king, I know Britain’s doom:\r\n  We must all to the stake or be converts to Rome.\r\n  Ah! Tudor! ah! Tudor! of Stuarts enough.\r\n  None ever reigned like old Bess in her ruff.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  WOOLCHURCH.--But can’st thou devise when kings will be mended?\r\n\r\n     CHARING.--When the reign of the line of the Stuarts is ended.”\r\n\r\nIn April 1810 the sword, buckles, and straps fell from the statue.[385]\r\nThe king’s sword was stolen on the day on which Queen Victoria went to\r\nopen the Royal Exchange.\r\n\r\nLondon has its local traditions as well as the smallest village. There is\r\na foolish story that the sculptor of Charles I. and his steed committed\r\nsuicide in vexation at having forgotten to put a girth to the horse. The\r\nmyth has arisen from the supposition of there being no girth, and\r\nretailers of such stories, Mr. Leigh Hunt included, did not take the\r\ntrouble to ascertain whether there was or was not a girth. Unfortunately\r\nfor the story there is a girth, and it is clearly visible.\r\n\r\nThe pedestal, by some assigned to Marshal, by others to Grinling Gibbons,\r\nthe great wood-carver, and a Dutchman by birth, is seventeen feet high,\r\nand is enriched with the arms of England, trophies of armour, cupids, and\r\npalm-branches. It is erected in the centre of a circular area, thirty feet\r\nin diameter, raised one step from the roadway, and enclosed with iron\r\nrails. The lion and unicorn are much mutilated, and the trophies are\r\nhoneycombed and corroded by the weather. It has not been generally\r\nobserved that on the south side of the pedestal two weeping children\r\nsupport a crown of thorns, and that the same emblem is repeated on the\r\nopposite side, below the royal arms.\r\n\r\nIn 1727 (1st George II.) that infamous rogue, Edmund Curll, the publisher\r\nof all the filth and slander of his age, stood in the pillory at Charing\r\nCross for printing a vile work called _Venus in a Cloyster_. He was not,\r\nhowever, pelted or ill-used; for, with the usual lying and cunning of his\r\nreptile nature, he had circulated printed papers telling the people that\r\nhe stood there for daring to vindicate the memory of Queen Anne. The mob\r\nallowed no one to touch him; and when he was taken down they carried him\r\noff in triumph to a neighbouring tavern.[386]\r\n\r\nArchenholz, an observant Prussian officer who was in England in 1784,\r\ntells a curious anecdote of the statue at Charing Cross. During the war in\r\nwhich General Braddock was defeated by the French in America, about the\r\ntime when Minorca was in the enemy’s hands, and poor Byng had just fallen\r\na victim to popular fury, an unhappy Spaniard, who did not know a word of\r\nEnglish, and had just arrived in England, was surrounded by a mob near\r\nWhitehall, who took him by his dress for a French spy. One of the rabble\r\ninstantly proposed to mount him on the king’s horse. The idea was adopted.\r\nA ladder was brought, and the miserable Spaniard was forced upon its back,\r\nto be loaded with insults and pelted with mud. Luckily for the stranger,\r\nat that moment a cabinet minister happening to pass by, stopped to inquire\r\nthe cause of the crowd. On addressing the man in French he discovered the\r\nmistake, and informed the mob. They instantly helped the man down, and the\r\nminister, taking him in his coach to the Spanish ambassador, apologised in\r\nthe name of the nation for a mistake that might have been fatal.[387]\r\n\r\nIn June 1731 Japhet Crook, _alias_ Sir Peter Stranger, who had been found\r\nguilty of forging the writings to an estate, was sentenced to imprisonment\r\nfor life.[388] He was condemned to stand for one hour in the pillory at\r\nCharing Cross. He was then seated in an elbow-chair; the common hangman\r\ncut off both his ears with an incision knife, and then delivered them to\r\nMr. Watson, a sheriff’s officer. He also slit both Crook’s nostrils with a\r\npair of scissors, and seared them with a hot iron, pursuant to the\r\nsentence. A surgeon attended on the pillory and instantly applied styptics\r\nto prevent the effusion of blood. The man bore the operations with\r\nundaunted courage. He laughed on the pillory, and denied the fact to the\r\nlast. He was then removed to the Ship Tavern at Charing Cross, and thence\r\ntaken back to the King’s Bench prison, to be confined there for life.[389]\r\n\r\nThis Crook had forged the conveyance, to himself, of an estate, upon which\r\nhe took up several thousand pounds. He was at the same time sued in\r\nChancery for having fraudulently obtained a will and wrongfully gained an\r\nestate. In spite of losing his ears, he enjoyed the ill-gained money in\r\nprison till the day of his death, and then quietly left it to his\r\nexecutor. He is mentioned by Pope in his 3d epistle, written in 1732.\r\nTalking of riches, he says--\r\n\r\n  “What can they give?--to dying Hopkins heirs?\r\n  To Chartres vigour? Japhet nose and ears?”[390]\r\n\r\nIt was in this essay that, having been accused of attacking the Duke of\r\nChandos, Pope first began to attack vices instead of follies, and, in\r\norder to prevent mistakes, boldly to publish the names of the malefactors\r\nwhom he gibbeted.\r\n\r\nCrook had been a brewer on Tower Hill. The 2d George II., c. 25, made\r\nforgery a felony; and the first sufferer under the new law was Richard\r\nCooper, a Stepney victualler, who was hanged at Tyburn, in June 1731, six\r\ndays only after the older and luckier thief had stood in the pillory.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 Parsons, the parish-clerk of St. Sepulchre’s, and the impudent\r\ncontriver of the “Cock Lane ghost” deception, mounted here to the same bad\r\neminence. Parsons’s child, a cunning little girl of twelve years, had\r\ncontrived to tap on her bed in a way that served to convey what were\r\nsupposed to be supernatural messages. It proved to be a plot devised by\r\nParsons out of malice against a gentleman of Norfolk who had sued him for\r\na debt. This gentleman was a widower, who had taken his wife’s sister as\r\nhis mistress--a marriage with her being forbidden by law--and had brought\r\nher to lodge with Parsons, from whence he had removed her to other\r\nlodgings, where she had died suddenly of small-pox. The object of Parsons\r\nwas to obtain the ghost’s declaration that she had been poisoned by\r\nParsons’s creditor. The rascal was set three times in the pillory and\r\nimprisoned for a year in the King’s Bench. The people, however, singularly\r\nenough, did not pelt the impudent rogue, but actually collected money for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere is a rare sheet-print of Charing Cross by Sutton Nicholls, in the\r\nreign of Queen Anne. It shows about forty small square stone posts\r\nsurrounding the pedestal of the statue. The spot seems to have been a\r\nfavourite standing-place for hackney coaches and sedan chairs. Every house\r\nhas a long stepping-stone for horsemen at a regulated distance from the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nIn 1737 Hogarth published his four prints of the “Times of the Day.”[391]\r\nThe scene of _Night_ is laid at Charing Cross; it is an\r\nillumination-night. Some drunken Freemasons and the Salisbury “High-flyer”\r\ncoach upset over a street bonfire near the Rummer Tavern, fill up the\r\npicture, which is curious as showing the roadway much narrower than it is\r\nnow, and impeded with projecting signs above and bulkheads below.\r\n\r\nThe place is still further immortalised in the old song--\r\n\r\n  “I cry my matches by Charing Cross,\r\n  Where sits a black man on a black horse.”\r\n\r\nIn a sixpenny book for children, published about 1756, the absurd figure\r\nof King George impaled on the top of Bloomsbury Church is contrasted with\r\nthat of King Charles at the Cross.\r\n\r\n    “No longer stand staring,\r\n    My friend, at Cross Charing,\r\n  Amidst such a number of people;\r\n    For a man on a horse\r\n    Is a matter of course,\r\n  But look! here’s a king on a steeple.”[392]\r\n\r\nIt was at Robinson’s coffee-house, at Charing Cross, that that clever\r\nscamp, vigorous versifier, and, as I think, great impostor, Richard\r\nSavage, stabbed to death a Mr. Sinclair in a drunken brawl. Savage had\r\ncome up from Richmond to settle a claim for lodgings, when, meeting two\r\nfriends, he spent the night in drinking, till it was too late to get a\r\nbed. As the three revellers passed Robinson’s, a place of no very good\r\nname, they saw a light, knocked at the door, and were admitted. It was a\r\ncold, raw, November night; and hearing that the company in the parlour\r\nwere about to leave, and that there was a fire there, they pushed in and\r\nkicked down the table. A quarrel ensued, swords were drawn, and Mr.\r\nSinclair received a mortal wound. The three brawlers then fled, and were\r\ndiscovered lurking in a back-court by the soldiers who came to stop the\r\nfray. The three men were taken to the Gate House at Westminster, and the\r\nnext morning to Newgate. That cruel and bullying judge, Page, hounded on\r\nthe jury at the trial in the following violent summing up:--“Gentlemen of\r\nthe jury, you are to consider that Mr. Savage is a very great man, a much\r\ngreater man than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; that he wears very fine\r\nclothes, much finer than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; that he has\r\nabundance of money in his pocket, much more money than you or I, gentlemen\r\nof the jury; but, gentlemen of the jury, is it not a very hard case,\r\ngentlemen of the jury, that Mr. Savage should therefore kill you or me,\r\ngentlemen of the jury?”\r\n\r\nThe verdict was of course “Guilty,” for these homicides during tavern\r\nbrawls had become frightfully common, and quiet citizens were never sure\r\nof their lives. Sentence of death was recorded against him. Eventually a\r\nlady at court interceded for the poet, who escaped with six months’\r\nimprisonment in Newgate, which he certainly well deserved.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to suppose from the researches of Mr. W. Moy Thomas,\r\nthat Savage was an impostor. He claimed to be the illegitimate son of the\r\nCountess of Macclesfield by Lord Rivers. The lady had an illegitimate\r\nchild born in Fox Court, Gray’s Inn Lane in 1697; but this child, there\r\nis reason to think, died in 1698.[393] Savage imposed on Dr. Johnson and\r\nother friends with stories of being placed at school and apprenticed to a\r\nshoemaker in Holborn by his countess mother, until among his nurse’s old\r\nletters he one day accidentally discovered the secret of his birth. There\r\nis no proof at all of his being persecuted by the countess, whose life he\r\nrendered miserable by insults, lampoons, abuse, slander, and begging\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nPope has embalmed Page in the _Dunciad_ just as a scorpion is preserved in\r\na spirit-bottle:--\r\n\r\n  “Morality by her false guardians drawn,\r\n  Chicane in furs, and Casuistry in lawn,\r\n  Gasps as they straighten at each end the cord,\r\n  And dies when Dulness gives her _Page_ the word.”[394]\r\n\r\nAnd again, with equal bitterness and truth, in his _Imitations of\r\nHorace_:--\r\n\r\n  “Slander or poison dread from Delia’s rage,\r\n  Hard words or hanging if your judge be Page.”\r\n\r\nThis “hanging judge,” who enjoyed his ermine and his infamy till he was\r\neighty, first obtained preferment by writing political pamphlets. He was\r\nmade a Baron of the Exchequer in 1718, a Justice of the Common Pleas in\r\n1726, and in 1727 transferred to the Court of King’s Bench. Page was so\r\nilliterate that he commenced one of his charges to the grand jury of\r\nMiddlesex with this remarkable statement: “I dare venture to affirm,\r\ngentlemen, on my own knowledge, that England never was so happy, both _at\r\nhome and abroad_, as it now is.” Horace Walpole mentions that when Crowle,\r\nthe punning lawyer, was once entering an assize court, some one asked him\r\nif Judge Page was not “just behind.” Crowle replied, “I don’t know, but I\r\nam sure he never was just before.”[395]\r\n\r\nThe various mews, now stables, about London, derive their name from the\r\nenclosure where falcons in the Middle Ages were kept to mew (_mutare_,\r\nMinshew) their feathers. The King’s Mews stood on the site of the present\r\nTrafalgar Square. In the 13th Edward II. John de la Becke had the custody\r\nof the Mews “apud Charing, juxta Westminster.” In the 10th Edward III.\r\nJohn de St. Albans succeeded Becke. In Richard II.’s time the office of\r\nking’s falconer, a post of importance, was held by Sir Simon Burley, who\r\nwas constable of the castles of Windsor, Wigmore, and Guilford, and also\r\nof the royal manor of Kennington. This Sir Simon had been selected by the\r\nBlack Prince as guardian of Richard II., and he also negotiated his\r\nmarriage. One of the complaints of Wat Tyler and his party was that he had\r\nthrown a burgher of Gravesend into Rochester Castle. The Duke of\r\nGloucester had him executed in 1388, in spite of Richard’s queen praying\r\nupon her knees for his life. At the end of this reign or in the first year\r\nof Henry IV., the poet Chaucer was clerk of the king’s works and also of\r\nthe Mews at Charing; and here, from his fluttering, angry little feathered\r\nsubjects, he must have drawn many of those allusions to the brave sport of\r\nhawking to be found in the immortal _Canterbury Tales_.\r\n\r\nThe falconry continued at Charing till 1534 (26th Henry VIII.), when the\r\nking’s fine stabling, with many horses and a great store of hay, being\r\ndestroyed by fire, the Mews was rebuilt and turned into royal stables, in\r\nthe reigns of Edward VI. and Mary.[396]\r\n\r\nM. St. Antoine, the riding-master, whose portrait Vandyke painted,\r\nperformed his caracoles and demi-tours at the Mews. Here Cromwell\r\nimprisoned Lieut.-Colonel George Joyce, who, when plain cornet, had\r\narrested the king at Holmby. An angry little Puritan pamphlet of four\r\npages, published in 1659, gives an account of Cromwell’s troubles with the\r\nfractious Joyce, and how he had resolved to cashier him and destroy his\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nThe colonel was carried by musqueteers to the common Dutch prison at the\r\nMews, and seems to have been much tormented by Cavalier vermin. There he\r\nremained ten days, and was then removed to another close room, where he\r\nfell sick from the “evil smells,” and remained so for ten weeks, refusing\r\nall the time to lay down his commission, declaring that he had been\r\nunworthily dealt with, and that all that had been sworn against him was\r\nfalse.\r\n\r\nThere was at the Mews gate a celebrated old book shop, opened in 1750 by\r\nMr. Thomas Payne, who kept it alive for forty years. It was the rendezvous\r\nof all noblemen and scholars who sought rare books. It may be remarked, by\r\nthe way, that booksellers’ shops have always been the haunts of wits and\r\npoets. Dodsley, the ex-footman, gathered round him the wisest men of his\r\nage, as Tonson had also done before him; while, as for John Murray’s back\r\nparlour, it was in Byron’s and Moore’s days a very temple of the Muses.\r\n\r\nIn Charles II.’s time the famous but ugly horse Rowley lived at the Mews,\r\nand gave a nickname to his swarthy royal master.\r\n\r\nIn 1732 that impudent charlatan, Kent, rebuilt the Mews, which was only\r\nremarkable after that for sheltering for a time Mr. Cross’s menagerie,\r\nwhen first removed from Exeter Change in 1829.\r\n\r\nThe National Gallery, one of the poorest buildings in London (which is\r\nsaying a good deal), was built between 1832 and 1838, from the designs of\r\na certain unfortunate Mr. Wilkins, R.A. It is not often that Fortune is so\r\nmalicious as to give an inferior artist such ample room to show his\r\ninability. The vote for founding the Gallery passed in Parliament in April\r\n1824. The columns of the portico were part of the screen of Carlton\r\nHouse--interesting memorials of a debasing regency, and, if possible, of a\r\nworse reign. The site has been called “the finest in Europe:” it is,\r\nhowever, a fine site, which is more than can be said of the building that\r\ncovers it. The front is 500 feet long. In the centre is a portico, on\r\nstilts, with eight Corinthian columns approached by a double flight of\r\nsteps; a low squat dome not much larger than a washing basin; and two\r\npepper-castor turrets that crown the eyesore of London. Though on high\r\nground--very high ground for a rather flat city--the architect, pinched\r\nfor money, contrived to make the building lower than the grand portico of\r\nSt. Martin’s Church, and even than the houses of Suffolk Place.\r\n\r\nOne of the last occasions on which William IV. appeared in public was in\r\n1837, before the opening of the first Academy Exhibition here in May. The\r\ngood-natured king is said to have suggested calling the square\r\n“Trafalgar,” and erecting a Nelson monument. A subscription was opened,\r\nand the Duke of Buccleuch was appointed chairman.\r\n\r\nThe square was commenced in 1829, but was not completed till after 1849.\r\nThe Nelson column was begun in 1837, and the statue set up in November\r\n1843. Three premiums were offered for the three best designs, and Mr.\r\nRailton carried off the palm. Upwards of £20,480 were subscribed, and,\r\n£12,000 it was thought would be required to complete the monument.[397] It\r\nwas originally intended to expend only £30,000 upon the whole.[398] Alas\r\nfor estimates so sanguine, so fallacious! the granite work alone cost\r\nupwards of £10,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Railton chose a column, after mature reflection; although triumphal\r\ncolumns are bad art, and the invention of a barbarous people and a corrupt\r\nage.[399] He rejected a temple, as too expensive and too much in the way;\r\na group of figures he condemned as not visible at a distance; he finally\r\nchose a Corinthian column as new, as harmonious, and as uniting the\r\nlabours of sculptor and architect.\r\n\r\nThe column, with its base and pedestal, measures 193 feet. The fluted\r\nshaft has a torus of oak leaves. The capital is copied from the fine\r\nexample of Mars Ultor at Rome; from it rises a circular pedestal wreathed\r\nwith laurel, and surmounted by a statue of Nelson, eighteen feet high, and\r\nformed of two blocks of stone from the Granton quarry. The great pedestal\r\nis adorned with four bassi-relievi, eighteen feet square each,\r\nrepresenting four of Nelson’s great victories. It is difficult to say\r\nwhich is tamest of the four. That of “Trafalgar” is by Mr. Carew; the\r\n“Nile,” by Mr. Woodington; “St. Vincent,” by Mr. Watson; and “Copenhagen,”\r\nby Mr. Ternouth.\r\n\r\nThe pedestal is raised on a flight of fifteen steps, at the angles of\r\nwhich are placed couchant lions from the designs of Sir Edwin Landseer.\r\nThey are forged out of French cannon. The capital is of the same costly\r\nmaterial, which, considering the brave English blood it has cost, should\r\nhave been painted crimson. Many years passed by after the commission was\r\ngiven to Sir Edwin Landseer before they were placed _in situ_.\r\n\r\nThe cocked hat on Mr. Baily’s statue has been somewhat unjustly ridiculed,\r\nand so has the coil of rope or pigtail supporting the hero.\r\n\r\nThe bronze equestrian statue of George IV., at the north-east end of the\r\nsquare, is by Chantrey. It was ordered by the king in 1829. The price was\r\nto be 9000 guineas, but the worthy monarch never paid the sculptor more\r\nthan a third of that sum; the rest was given by the Woods and Forests out\r\nof the national taxes, and the third instalment in 1843, after Chantrey’s\r\ndeath, by the Lords of the Treasury. It is a sprightly and clever statue,\r\nbut of no great merit. It should have been paid for by William IV., just\r\nas the Nelson statue should have been erected by Parliament, the honour\r\nbeing one due to Nelson from an ungrateful nation. This statue of George\r\nIV. was originally intended to crown the arch in front of Buckingham\r\nPalace--an arch that cost £80,000, and that was hung with gates that cost\r\n3000 guineas. The so-called Chartist riots of 1848 were commenced by boys\r\ndestroying the hoarding round the base of the Nelson monument.\r\n\r\nThe fountains in the centre of the Square are of Peterhead granite, and\r\nwere made at Aberdeen. They are mean, despicable, and unworthy of the\r\nnoble position which they occupy. Some years ago there was a fuss about an\r\nArtesian well that was to feed these stone punch-bowls with inexhaustible\r\ngushes of silvery water. This supply has dwindled down to a sort of\r\noverflow of a ginger-beer bottle once a day. I blush when I take a\r\nforeigner to see Trafalgar Square, with its squat domes, its mean statues,\r\nits tame bassi-relievi, and its disgraceful fountains.\r\n\r\nI will not trust myself to criticise the statues of Napier and Havelock.\r\nThe figures are poor, and unworthy of the fiery soldier and the Christian\r\nhero they misrepresent. They should be in the Abbey. Why has the Abbey\r\ngrown, like the Court, less receptive than ever? What passport is there\r\ninto the Abbey, where such strange people sleep, if the conquest of Scinde\r\nand the relief of Lucknow will not take a body there.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the National Gallery. Mr. G. Agar-Ellis, afterwards Lord\r\nDover, first proposed a National Gallery in Parliament in 1824; Government\r\nhaving previously purchased thirty-eight pictures from Mr. Angerstein for\r\n£57,000. This collection included “The Raising of Lazarus,” by Del Piombo.\r\nIt is supposed that Michael Angelo, jealous of Raphael’s\r\n“Transfiguration,” helped Sebastian in the drawing of his cartoon, which\r\nwas to be a companion picture for Narbonne Cathedral. It was purchased\r\nfrom the Orleans Gallery for 3500 guineas.[400]\r\n\r\nIn 1825 some pictures were purchased for the Gallery from Mr. Hamlet.\r\nThese included the “Bacchus and Ariadne” of Titian, for £5000. This golden\r\npicture (extolled by Vasari) was painted about 1514 for the Duke of\r\nFerrara. Titian was then in the full vigour of his thirty-seventh\r\nyear.[401]\r\n\r\nIn the same year “La Vierge au Panier” of Correggio was purchased from Mr.\r\nNieuwenhuy, a picture-dealer, for £3800. It is a late picture, and hurt in\r\ncleaning. It was one of the gems of the Madrid Gallery.\r\n\r\nIn 1826, Sir George Beaumont presented sixteen pictures, valued at 7500\r\nguineas. These included one of the finest landscapes of Rubens, “The\r\nChateau,” which originally cost £1500, and Wilkie’s _chef-d’œuvre_, that\r\nfine Raphaelesque composition, “The Blind Fiddler.”\r\n\r\nIn 1834 the Rev. William Holwell Carr left the nation thirty-five\r\npictures, including fine specimens of the Caracci, Titian, Luini,\r\nGarofalo, Claude, Poussin, and Rubens.\r\n\r\nAnother important donation was that of the great “Peace and War,” bought\r\nfor £3000 by the Marquis of Stafford, and given to the nation. It was\r\noriginally presented to Charles I., by Rubens, who gave unto the king not\r\nas a painter but as almost a king.\r\n\r\nThe British Institution also gave three esteemed pictures by Reynolds,\r\nGainsborough, and West, and a fine Parmigiano.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest addition to the collection was made in 1834, when\r\n£11,500[402] were given for the two great Correggios, the “Ecce Homo” and\r\nthe “Education of Cupid,” from the Marquis of Londonderry’s collection. To\r\nthe “Ecce Homo” Pungileoni assigns the date 1520, when the great master\r\nwas only twenty-six. It once belonged to Murat. The “Education of Cupid,”\r\nwhich once belonged to Charles I., has been a good deal retouched.[403]\r\n\r\nIn 1836 King William IV. presented to the gallery six pictures; in 1837\r\nColonel Harvey Ollney gave seventeen; in 1838 Lord Farnborough bequeathed\r\nfifteen, and R. Simmons, Esq., fourteen. The last pictures were chiefly of\r\nthe Netherlands school. In 1854 the nation possessed two hundred and\r\nsixteen pictures, and of these seventy only had been purchased.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 that greatest of all landscape-painters, Joseph M. W. Turner, left\r\nthe nation 362 oil-paintings, and about 19,000 sketches (including 1757\r\nwater-colour drawings of value). In his will this eccentric man\r\nparticularly desired that two of his pictures--a Dutch coast-scene and\r\n“Dido Building Carthage”--should be hung between Claude’s “Sea-Port” and\r\n“Mill.”\r\n\r\nThe will was disputed, and the engravings and the money, all but £20,000,\r\nwent to the next of kin.\r\n\r\nThe diploma pictures (that formerly were annually exhibited to the public)\r\nare of great interest. They were given by various members of the Royal\r\nAcademy at their elections. That of the parsimonious Wilkie--“Boys digging\r\nfor Rats” (fine as Teniers)--is remarkably small. There is a very fine\r\ngraceful portrait of Sir William Chambers, the architect, by Reynolds, and\r\none still more robust and glowing of Sir Joshua by himself. He is in his\r\ndoctor’s robes. There is a splendid but rather pale Etty--“A Satyr\r\nsurprising a Nymph;” and a fine vigorous picture by Briggs, of “Blood\r\nstealing the Crown.”\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Robert Vernon, Esq., nobly left the nation one hundred and\r\nsixty-two fine examples of the English school. These are now removed to\r\nthe Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\nOf the pictures given by Turner to the nation, the masterpieces are the\r\n“Téméraire” and the “Escape of Ulysses,”--both triumphs of colour and\r\nimagination. The one is a scene from the _Odyssey_; the other represents\r\nan old man-of-war being towed to its last berth--a scene witnessed by the\r\nartist himself while boating near Greenwich. The works of Turner may be\r\ndivided very fairly into three eras: those in which he imitated the Dutch\r\nlandscape-painters, the period when he copied idealised Nature, and the\r\ntime when he resorted from eccentricity or indifference to reckless\r\nexperiments in colour and effect--most of them quite unworthy of his\r\ngenius. Not in drawing the figure, but in aërial perspective, did Turner\r\nexcel. The great portfolios of drawings that he left the nation show with\r\nwhat untiring and laborious industry he toiled. In habits sordid and mean,\r\nin tastes low and debased, this great genius, the son of a humble\r\nhairdresser in Maiden Lane, succeeded in attaining an excellence in\r\nlandscape, fitful and unequal it is true, but often rising to poetic\r\nregions unknown to Claude, Ruysdael, Vandervelde, Salvator, or Backhuysen.\r\n\r\nEver since the modern pictures were removed to South Kensington, there has\r\nbeen a constant effort to transfer the ancient pictures and to abandon the\r\nNational Gallery to the Royal Academy--a rich society, making £5000 or\r\n£6000 a year, which its members cannot spend, and which tenants the\r\nnational building only by permission. To remove the pictures from the\r\ncentre of London is to remove them from those who cannot go far to see\r\nthem, to the neighbourhood of rich people who do not need their teaching,\r\nand who have picture-galleries of their own.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, twenty pictures were bequeathed to the gallery by Mr. Jacob Bell,\r\nand a few years later twenty-two others were added as a gift by Her\r\nMajesty. The last great addition is the presentation of ninety-four\r\npictures by Mr. Wynn Ellis. But in spite of all these treasures, acquired\r\nby purchase or by bequest, the nation cannot boast that its gallery does\r\njustice to our taste or national wealth. It is still lamentably deficient\r\nin more than one department; and there are not wanting those who assert\r\nthat the Royal Academy stifles art rather than promotes it. It is regarded\r\nby the outside world as a close-borough, in which the interests of the\r\npublic and of students are postponed to those of its Associates and\r\nMembers, the A.R.A.’s and R.A.’s of the age.\r\n\r\nThe building in which the collection is deposited was erected at the\r\nnational expense, from the designs of Mr. William Wilkins, R.A., and\r\nopened to the public in 1838. It was considerably altered and enlarged in\r\n1860, and in 1869 five other rooms were added by the surrender to the\r\nTrustees of those hitherto appropriated by the Royal Academy. In 1876 a\r\nnew wing was added, after a design by Mr. E. M. Barry, R.A., and the whole\r\ncollection is now under one roof.\r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Physicians is a large classic building at the\r\nnorth-west corner of Trafalgar Square. It was built in 1823 from the\r\ndesigns of Sir Robert Smirke. The college was founded in 1518 by Dr.\r\nLinacre, the successor to Shakspeare’s Dr. Butts, and physician to Henry\r\nVII. From Knightrider Street the doctors moved to Amen Corner, and thence\r\nto Warwick Lane, between Newgate Street and Paternoster Row. The number of\r\nfellows, originally thirty, is now as unlimited as the “dira cohors” of\r\ndiseases that the college has to encounter.\r\n\r\nIn the gallery above the library there are seven preparations made by the\r\ncelebrated Harvey when at Padua--“learned Padua.” There are also some\r\nexcellent portraits--Harvey, by Jansen; Sir Thomas Browne, the author of\r\n_Religio Medici_; Sir Theodore Mayerne, the physician of James I.; Sir\r\nEdmund King, who, on his own responsibility, bled Charles II. during a\r\nfit; Dr. Sydenham, by Mary Beale; Doctor Radcliffe, William III.’s doctor,\r\nby Kneller; Sir Hans Sloane, the founder of the British Museum, by\r\nRichardson, whom Hogarth rather unjustly ridiculed; honest Garth (of the\r\n“Dispensary”), by Kneller; Dr. Freind, Dr. Mead, Dr. Warren (by\r\nGainsborough); William Hunter, and Dr. Heberden.\r\n\r\nThere are also some valuable and interesting busts--George IV., by\r\nChantrey (a _chef-d’œuvre_); Dr. Mead, by the vivacious Roubilliac; Dr.\r\nSydenham, by Wilton; Harvey, by Scheemakers; Dr. Baillie, by Chantrey,\r\nfrom a model by Nollekens; Dr. Babington, by poor Behnes. One of the\r\ntreasures of the place is Dr. Radcliffe’s gold-headed cane, which was\r\nsuccessively carried by Drs. Mead, Askew, Pitcairn, and Baillie. There is\r\nalso a portrait-picture by Zoffany of Hunter delivering a lecture on\r\nanatomy to the Royal Academy. Any fellow can give an order to see this\r\nhoarded collection, which should be thrown open to the public on certain\r\ndays. It is selfish and utterly wanting in public spirit to keep such\r\ntreasures in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe wits buzzed about Charing Cross between 1680 and 1730 as thick as bees\r\nround May flowers. In this district, between those years, stood “The\r\nElephant,” “The Sugarloaf,” “The Old Man’s Coffee-house,” “The Old Vine,”\r\n“The Three Flower de Luces,” “The British Coffee-house,” “The Young Man’s\r\nCoffee-house,” and “The Three Queens.”\r\n\r\nThere is an erroneous tradition that Cromwell had a house on the site of\r\nDrummond’s bank. He really lived farther south, in King Street. When the\r\nbank was built, the houses were set back full forty yards more to the\r\nwest, upon an open square place called “Cromwell’s Yard.”[405]\r\n\r\nDrummond’s is said to have gained its fame by advancing money secretly to\r\nthe Pretender. Upon this being known, the Court withdrew all their\r\ndeposits. The result was that the Scotch Tory noblemen rallied round the\r\nhouse and brought in so much money that the firm soon became leading\r\nbankers, dividing the West End custom with Messrs. Coutts.\r\n\r\nCraig’s Court, on the east side of Charing Cross, was built in 1702. It is\r\ngenerally supposed to have been named after the father of Mr. Secretary\r\nCraggs, the friend of Pope and Addison: Mr. Cunningham, an excellent and\r\nreliable authority, says that as early as the year 1658 there was a James\r\nCragg living on the “water side,” in the Charing Cross division of St.\r\nMartin’s-in-the-Fields. The Sun Fire-office was established in this court\r\nin 1726; and here is Cox and Greenwood’s, the largest army agency office\r\nin Great Britain.\r\n\r\nLocket’s, the famous ordinary, so called from Adam Locket, the landlord in\r\n1674, stood on the site of Drummond’s bank. An Edward Locket succeeded to\r\nhim in 1688, and remained till 1702.[406] In 1693 the second Locket took\r\nthe Bowling-green House at Putney Heath. That fair, slender, genteel Sir\r\nGeorge Etherege, whom Rochester praises for “fancy, sense, judgment, and\r\nwit,” frequented Locket’s, and displayed there his courtly foppery, which\r\nserved as a model for his own Dorimant, and that prince and patriarch of\r\nfops Sir Fopling Flutter. Sir George was always gentle and courtly, and\r\nwas compared in this to Sedley.\r\n\r\nHe once got into a violent passion at the ordinary, and abused the\r\n“drawers” for some neglect. This brought in Mrs. Locket, hot and fuming.\r\n“We are so provoked,” said Sir George, “that even I could find it in my\r\nheart to pull the nosegay out of your bosom, and fling the flowers in your\r\nface.” This mild and courteous threat turned his friends’ anger into a\r\ngeneral laugh.\r\n\r\nSir George having run up a long score at Locket’s, added to the injury by\r\nceasing to frequent the house. Mrs. Locket began to dun and threaten him.\r\nHe sent word back by the messenger that he would kiss her if she stirred a\r\nstep in it. When Mrs. Locket heard this, she bridled up, called for her\r\nhood and scarf, and told her anxious husband that she’d see if there was\r\nany fellow alive who had the impudence! “Prythee, my dear, don’t be so\r\nrash,” said her milder husband; “you don’t know what a man may do in his\r\npassion.”[407]\r\n\r\nWycherly, that favourite of Charles II. till he married his titled wife,\r\nwrites in one of his plays (1675), “Why, thou art as shy of my kindness as\r\na Lombard Street alderman of a courtier’s civility at Locket’s.”[408]\r\nShadwell too, Dryden’s surly and clever foe, says (1691), “I’ll answer you\r\nin a couple of brimmers of claret at Locket’s at dinner, where I have\r\nbespoke an admirable good one.”[409]\r\n\r\nA poet of 1697 describes the sparks, dressed by noon hurrying to the Mall,\r\nand from thence to Locket’s.[410] Prior proposes to dine at a crown a head\r\non ragouts washed down with champagne; then to go to court; and lastly he\r\nsays[411]--\r\n\r\n  “With evening wheels we’ll drive about the Park,\r\n  Finish at Locket’s, and reel home i’ the dark.”\r\n\r\nIn 1708, Vanbrugh makes Lord Foppington doubtful whether he shall return\r\nto dinner, as the noble peer says--“As Gad shall judge me I can’t tell,\r\nfor ’tis possible I may dine with some of our House at Lacket’s.”[412]\r\n\r\nAnd in the same play the very energetic nobleman remarks--“From thence\r\n(the Park) I go to dinner at Lacket’s, where you are so nicely and\r\ndelicately served that, stap my vitals! they shall compose you a dish no\r\nbigger than a saucer shall come to fifty shillings. Between eating my\r\ndinner and washing my mouth, ladies, I spend my time till I go to the\r\nplay.”\r\n\r\nIn 1709 the epicurean and ill-fated Dr. King, talking of the changes in\r\nSt. James’s Park, says--\r\n\r\n  “For Locket’s stands where gardens once did spring,\r\n  And wild ducks quack where grasshoppers did sing.”[413]\r\n\r\nTom Brown also mentions Locket’s, for he writes--“We as naturally went\r\nfrom Mann’s Coffee-house to the Parade as a coachman drives from Locket’s\r\nto the play-house.”\r\n\r\nPrior, the poet, when his father the joiner died, was taken care of by his\r\nuncle, who kept the Rummer Tavern at the back of No. 14 Charing Cross, two\r\ndoors from Locket’s. It was a well-frequented house, and in 1685 the\r\nannual feast of the nobility and gentry of St. Martin’s parish was held\r\nthere. Prior was sent by the honest vintner to study under the great Dr.\r\nBusby at Westminster: and in a window-seat at the Rummer the future poet\r\nand diplomatist was found reading Horace, according to Bishop Burnet, by\r\nthe witty Earl of Dorset, who is said to have educated him. Prior, in the\r\ndedication of his poems to the earl’s son, proves his patron to have been\r\na paragon. Waller and Sprat consulted Dorset about their writings. Dryden,\r\nCongreve, and Addison praised him. He made the court read _Hudibras_, the\r\ntown praise Wycherly’s “Plain Dealer,” and Buckingham delay his\r\n“Rehearsal” till he knew his opinion. Pope imitated his “Dorinda,” and\r\nKing Charles took his advice upon Lely’s portraits.\r\n\r\nOne of Prior’s gayest and pleasantest poems seems to prove, however, that\r\nFleetwood Shepherd was a more essential patron than even the earl. The\r\npoet writes--\r\n\r\n  “Now, as you took me up when little,\r\n  Gave me my learning and my vittle,\r\n  Asked for me from my lord things fitting,\r\n  Kind as I’d been your own begetting,\r\n  Confirm what formerly you’ve given,\r\n  Nor leave me now at six and seven,\r\n  As Sunderland has left Mun Stephen.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, still more gaily--\r\n\r\n  “My uncle, rest his soul! when living,\r\n  Might have contrived me ways of thriving,\r\n  Taught me with cider to replenish\r\n  My vats or ebbing tide of Rhenish;\r\n  So when for hock I drew pricked white-wine,\r\n  Swear’t had the flavour, and was right wine;\r\n  Or sent me with ten pounds to Furni-\r\n  val’s Inn, to some good rogue attorney,\r\n  Where now, by forging deeds and cheating,\r\n  I’d found some handsome ways of getting.\r\n  All this you made me quit to follow\r\n  That sneaking, whey-faced god, Apollo;\r\n  Sent me among a fiddling crew\r\n  Of folks I’d neither seen nor knew,\r\n  Calliope and God knows who,\r\n  I add no more invectives to it:\r\n  You spoiled the youth to make a poet.”\r\n\r\nThat rascally housebreaker, Jack Sheppard, made his first step towards the\r\ngallows by the robbery of two silver spoons at the Rummer Tavern. This\r\nyoung rogue, whose deeds Mr. Ainsworth has so mischievously recorded, was\r\nborn in 1701, and ended his short career at Tyburn in 1724.[414] The\r\nRummer Tavern is introduced by Hogarth into his engraving of “Night.” The\r\nbusiness was removed to the water side of Charing Cross in 1710, and the\r\nnew house burnt down in 1750. In 1688, Samuel Prior offered ten guineas\r\nreward for the discovery of some persons who had accused him of clipping\r\ncoin.[415]\r\n\r\nMrs. Centlivre, whom Pope pilloried in the _Dunciad_[416] was the daughter\r\nof a Lincolnshire gentleman, who, being a Nonconformist, fled to Ireland\r\nat the Restoration to escape persecution. Being left an orphan at the age\r\nof twelve, she travelled to London on foot to seek her fortune. In her\r\nsixteenth year she married a nephew of Sir Stephen Fox, who, however, did\r\nnot live more than a twelvemonth after. She afterwards wedded an officer\r\nnamed Carrol, who was killed in a duel soon after their marriage. Left a\r\nsecond time a widow, she then took to dramatic writing for a subsistence,\r\nand from 1700 to 1705 produced six comedies, to one of which--“The\r\nGamester”--the poet Rowe contributed a prologue. She next tried the stage;\r\nand while performing Alexander the Great, at Windsor, won the heart of Mr.\r\nCentlivre, “a Yeoman of the Mouth,” or principal cook to Queen Anne, who\r\nmarried her. She lived happily with her husband for eighteen years, and\r\nwrote some good, bustling, but licentious plays. “The Busybody,” and\r\n“Wonder; a Woman keeps a Secret,” act well.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1716, Mrs. Centlivre visited her native town of Holbeach for her\r\nhealth, and on King George’s birthday[417] invited all the pauper widows\r\nof the place to a tavern supper. The windows were illuminated, the\r\nchurch-bells were set ringing, there were musicians playing in the room,\r\nthe old women danced, and most probably got drunk, the enthusiastic\r\nloyalist making them all fall on their knees and drink the healths of the\r\nroyal family, the Duke of Marlborough, Mr. Walpole, the Duke of Argyle,\r\nGeneral Cadogan, etc. etc. She ended the feast by sending the ringers a\r\ncopy of stirring verses denouncing the Jacobites;--\r\n\r\n  “Disdain the artifice they use\r\n  To bring in mass and wooden shoes\r\n    With transubstantiation:\r\n  Remember James the Second’s reign,\r\n  When glorious William broke the chain\r\n    Rome had put on this nation.”\r\n\r\nThis clever but not too virtuous woman died at her house in Buckingham\r\nCourt, Spring Gardens, December 1, 1723.[418]\r\n\r\nPope’s dislike to Mrs. Centlivre is best explained by one of his own notes\r\nto the _Dunciad_:--“She (Mrs. C.) wrote many plays and a song before she\r\nwas seven years old: she also wrote a ballad against Mr. Pope’s _Homer_\r\nbefore he began it.” And why should not an authoress have expressed her\r\nopinion of Mr. Pope’s inability to translate Homer?\r\n\r\nMrs. Centlivre is rather bitterly treated by Leigh Hunt, who says that\r\nshe, “without doubt, wrote the most entertaining dramas of intrigue, with\r\na genius infinitely greater, and a modesty infinitely less, than that of\r\nher sex in general; and she delighted, whenever she could not be obscene,\r\nto be improbable.”[419]\r\n\r\nMilton lodged at one Thomson’s, next door to the Bull-head Tavern at\r\nCharing Cross, close to the opening to the Spring Gardens, during the time\r\nhe was writing his book _Joannis Philippi Angli Defensio_.[420]\r\n\r\nThe Golden Cross ran up beside the King’s Mews a little east of its\r\npresent site; it was the “Bull and Mouth” of the West End till railways\r\ndrew travellers from the old roads; it then became a railway parcel\r\noffice. Poor reckless Dr. Maginn wrote a ballad lamenting the change, in\r\nwhich he mourned the Mews Gate public-house, Tom Bish and his lotteries,\r\nand the barrack-yard. He curses Nash and Wyatville, and then bursts\r\nforth--\r\n\r\n  “No more I’ll eat the juicy steak\r\n    Within its boxes pent,\r\n  When in the mail my place I take,\r\n    For Bath or Brighton bent.\r\n\r\n  “No more the coaches I shall see\r\n    Come trundling from the yard,\r\n  Nor hear the horn blown cheerily\r\n    By brandy-sipping guard.\r\n  King Charles, I think, must sorrow sore,\r\n    E’en were he made of stone,\r\n  When left by all his friends of yore\r\n    (Like Tom Moore’s rose) alone.\r\n\r\n  “No wonder the triumphant Turk\r\n    O’er Missolonghi treads,\r\n  Roasts bishops, and in bloody work\r\n    Snips off some thousand heads!\r\n  No wonder that the Crescent gains,\r\n    When we the fact can’t gloss,\r\n  That we ourselves are at such pains\r\n    To trample down the Cross!\r\n\r\n  “Oh! London won’t be London long,\r\n    For ’twill be all pulled down,\r\n  And I shall sing a funeral song\r\n    O’er that time-honoured town.\r\n  One parting curse I here shall make,\r\n    And then lay down my quill,\r\n  Hoping Old Nick himself may take\r\n    Both Nash and Wyatville.”[421]\r\n\r\nTill late in the last century a lofty straddling sign-post and a long\r\nwater-trough, just such as still adorn country towns, stood before this\r\ninn.[422]\r\n\r\nCharing Cross Hospital, one of those great charities that atone for so\r\nmany of the sins of London, relieved, in the year 1878, 15,854 necessitous\r\npersons, including more than 1000 cases of severe accident, while above\r\n1500 persons were admitted on the recommendation of governors and\r\nsubscribers.[423] Surely, if anything can redeem our national vices, our\r\nselfishness, our commercial dishonesty, our unjust wars, and our\r\nunrighteous conquests, it must be such vast charities as these.\r\n\r\nOne authority represents that great scholar and divine, Dr. Isaac Barrow,\r\nthe friend of Newton, as having died “in mean lodgings at a saddler’s near\r\nCharing Cross, an old, low, ill-built house, which he had used for many\r\nyears.” Barrow was then Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. Roger North,\r\nhowever, says that he died of an overdose of opium, and “ended his days in\r\nLondon in a prebendary’s house that had a little stair to it out of the\r\ncloisters, which made him call it a _man’s nest_.”[424] Barrow died in\r\n1677, and was buried in the Abbey. Rhodes, the bookseller and actor, lived\r\nat the Ship at Charing Cross. He had been wardrobe-keeper at the\r\nBlackfriars Theatre; and in 1659 he reopened the Cockpit Theatre in Drury\r\nLane.\r\n\r\nOn September 7, 1650, as that dull, learned man, Bulstrode Whitelock, one\r\nof the Commissioners for the Great Seal, was going in his coach towards\r\nChelsea, a messenger from Scotland stopped him about Charing Cross, and\r\ncried, “Oh, my lord, God hath appeared gloriously to us in Scotland; a\r\nglorious day, my lord, at Dunbar in Scotland.” “I asked him,” says\r\nWhitelock, “how it was. He said that the General had routed all the Scots\r\narmy, but that he could not stay to tell me the particulars, being in\r\nhaste to go to the House.”[425]\r\n\r\nLord Dartmouth relates a story in Burnet of Sir Edward Seymour the\r\nSpeaker’s coach breaking down at Charing Cross, in Charles II.’s time. He\r\ninstantly, with proud coolness, ordered the beadles to stop the next\r\ngentleman’s coach that passed and bring it to him. The expelled gentleman\r\nwas naturally both surprised and angry; but Sir Edward gravely assured him\r\nthat it was far more proper for him than for the Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons to walk the streets, and accordingly left him to do so without any\r\nfurther apology.[426]\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole was a diligent attender at the State Trials of 1746. The\r\nday “poor brave old” Balmerino retracted his plea, asked pardon, and\r\ndesired the Peers to intercede for mercy, Walpole tells us that his\r\nlordship stopped the coach at Charing Cross as he returned to the Tower,\r\ncarelessly to buy “honey-blobs,” as the Scotch call gooseberries.\r\n\r\nBut we must not leave Charing Cross without specially remembering that\r\nwhen Boswell dared to praise Fleet Street as crowded and cheerful, Dr.\r\nJohnson replied in a voice of thunder, “Why, sir, Fleet Street _has_ a\r\nvery animated appearance; but I think the full tide of existence is at\r\nCharing Cross.”[427]\r\n\r\nNearly where the Post Office at Charing Cross now stands, there was once\r\n(of all things in the world) a hermitage. Even Prince George of Denmark\r\nmight have been pardoned by James II., his sour father-in-law, for making\r\nhis invariable reply, “Est-il possible?” to this statement. Yet the patent\r\nrolls of the 47th Henry III. grant permission to William de Radnor, Bishop\r\nof Llandaff, to lodge, with all his retainers, within the precinct of the\r\nHermitage at Charing, whenever he came to London.[428]\r\n\r\nOpposite this stood the ancient Hospital of St. Mary Roncevalles. It was\r\nfounded by William Marechal, Earl of Pembroke, a son, I believe, of the\r\nearly English conqueror of Ireland. It was suppressed by Henry V. as an\r\nalien priory, restored by Edward IV., and finally suppressed by Edward\r\nVI., who granted it to Sir Thomas Carwarden, to be held in free soccage of\r\nthe honour of Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe mesh and labyrinth of obscure alleys and lanes running between the\r\nbottom of St. Martin’s Lane and Bedford Street, towards Bedfordbury, with\r\nold Round Court, so called in mockery, for its centre, were swept away by\r\nthe besom of improvement in 1829, when Trafalgar Square was begun, never\r\nto be finished. In Elizabeth’s or James’s time, gallants who had cruised\r\nin search of Spanish galleons wittily nicknamed these Straits “the\r\nBermudas,” from their narrow and intricate channels. Here the valorous\r\nCaptain Bobadill must have lived in Barmecidal splendour, and have taught\r\nhis dupes the true conduct of the weapon. Justice Overdo mentions the\r\nBermudas with a righteous indignation. “Look,” says that great legal\r\nfunctionary, “into any angle of the town, the Streights or the Bermudas,\r\nwhere the quarrelling lesson is read, and how do they entertain the time\r\nbut with bottled ale and tobacco?”[429] How natural for Drake’s men to\r\ngive such a name to a labyrinth of devious alleys! At a subsequent period\r\nthe cluster of avenues exchanged the title of _Bermudas_ for that of the\r\n_C’ribbee Islands_, the learned possessors corrupting the name into a\r\nhappy allusion to the arts cultivated there.[430]\r\n\r\nGay, writing in 1715, describes the small streets branching from Charing\r\nCross as resounding with the shoeblacks’ cry, “Clean your honour’s shoes?”\r\nGreat improvements were made in 1829-30, when the present arcade leading\r\nfrom West Strand to St. Martin’s Church, and inhabited chiefly by German\r\ntoymen, was built and named after Lord Lowther then Chief Commissioner of\r\nthe Woods and Forests.[431] The Strand was also widened, and many old\r\ntottering houses were removed.\r\n\r\nPorridge Island was the cant name for a paved alley near St. Martin’s\r\nChurch, originally a congeries of cookshops erected for the workmen at the\r\nnew church, and destroyed when the great rookery there was pulled down in\r\n1829. It was a part of Bedfordbury, and derived its name from being full\r\nof cookshops, or “slap-bangs,” as street boys called such odorous places.\r\nA writer in _The World_, in 1753, describes a man like Beau Tibbs, who had\r\nhis dinner in a pewter plate from a cookshop in Porridge Island, and with\r\nonly £100 a year was foolish enough to wear a laced suit, go every evening\r\nin a chair to a rout, and return to his bedroom on foot, shivering and\r\nsupperless, vain enough to glory in having rubbed elbows with the quality\r\nof Brentford.[432]\r\n\r\nIt was in Round Court, in the centre of the key shops, herb shops, and\r\nfurniture warehouses of Bedfordbury that, in 1836, Robson the actor was\r\napprenticed to a Mr. Smellie, a copperplate engraver, and the printer of\r\nthe humorous caricatures of Mr. George Cruikshank.[433]\r\n\r\nThe Swan at Charing Cross, over against the Mews, flourished in 1665, when\r\nMarke Rider was the landlord. The token of the house bore the figure of a\r\nswan holding a sprig in its mouth. Its memory is embalmed in a curious\r\nextempore grace once said by Ben Jonson before King James. These are the\r\nverses:--\r\n\r\n  “Our king and queen the Lord God bless,\r\n  The Palsgrave and the Lady Besse;\r\n  And God bless every living thing\r\n  That lives and breathes, and loves the king;\r\n  God bless the Council of Estate,\r\n  And Buckingham the fortunate;\r\n  God bless them all, and keep them safe,\r\n  And God bless me, and God bless Ralph.”\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster king being mighty inquisitive to know who this Ralph was,\r\nBen told him it was the drawer at the Swan Tavern, who drew him good\r\ncanary. For this drollery the king gave Ben a hundred pounds.[434] The\r\nstory is probably true, for it is confirmed by Powell the actor.[435]\r\n\r\nThe street signs of London were condemned in the second year of George\r\nIII.’s reign; but the sweeping Act for their final removal was not passed\r\ntill nine years later. In 1762, Bonnel Thornton (aided by Hogarth) opened\r\nan exhibition of street signs in Bow Street[436] in ridicule of the Spring\r\nGardens exhibition. But as early as 1761 the street signs seem to have\r\nbeen partially removed as dangerous obstructions. A writer in a\r\ncontemporary paper says,[437] “My master yesterday sent me to take a place\r\nin the Canterbury stage; he said that when I came to Charing Cross I\r\nshould see which was the proper inn by the words on the sign. I rambled\r\nabout, but could see no sign at all. At last I was told that there used to\r\nbe such a sign under a little golden cross which I saw at a two pair of\r\nstairs window. I entered and found the waiter swearing about innovations.\r\nHe said that the members of Parliament were unaccountable enemies to signs\r\nwhich used to show trades; that, for his master’s part, he might put on\r\nsackcloth, for nobody came to buy sack. ‘If,’ said he, ‘any of the signs\r\nwere too large, could they not have limited their size without pulling\r\ndown the sign-posts and destroying the painted ornaments of the Strand?’\r\nOn my return I saw some men pulling with ropes at a curious sign-iron,\r\nwhich seemed to have cost some pounds: along with the iron down came the\r\nleaden cover to the pent-house, which will cost at least some pounds to\r\nrepair.”\r\n\r\nThis was written the year of the first Act (2d George III.), and was\r\nprobably a groan from some one interested in the existence of the abuse.\r\nThe inferior artists gained much money from this source. Mr. Wale, one of\r\nthe first Academicians, painted a Shakspere five feet high[438] for a\r\npublic-house at the north-west corner of Little Russell Street, Covent\r\nGarden. The picture was enclosed in a sumptuous carved gilt frame, and was\r\nsuspended by rich foliated ironwork. A London street a hundred years ago\r\nmust have been one long grotesque picture-gallery.\r\n\r\nWhen the meat is all good it is difficult to know where to insert the\r\nknife. In travelling, how hard it is to turn back almost in sight of some\r\nPromised Land of which one has often dreamed! Like that traveller I feel,\r\nwhen I find it necessary in this chapter to confine myself strictly to the\r\nlegends, traditions, and history of Charing Cross proper, leaving for\r\nother opportunities Spring Gardens, the story of the greater part of which\r\nbelongs more to St. James’s Park, Whitehall, and Scotland Yard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KING’S MEWS, 1750.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARRACK AND OLD HOUSES ON SITE OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE, 1826.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nST. MARTIN’S LANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaint Martin’s Lane, extending from Long Acre to Charing Cross, was built\r\nbefore 1613, and then called the West Church Lane. The first church was\r\nbuilt here by Henry VIII. The district was first called St. Martin’s Lane\r\nabout 1617-18.[439]\r\n\r\nSir Theodore Mayerne, physician to James I., lived on the west side of\r\nthis lane. Mayerne was the godson of Beza, the great Calvinist reformer,\r\nand one of Henry IV.’s physicians. He came to England after that king’s\r\ndeath. He then became James I.’s doctor, and was blamed for his treatment\r\nof Prince Henry, whom many thought to have been poisoned. He was\r\nafterwards physician to Charles I., and nominally to Charles II.; but he\r\ndied in 1655, five years before the Restoration. He gave his library to\r\nthe College of Physicians, and is said to have disclosed some of his\r\nchemical secrets to the great enameller, Petitot.[440] Mayerne died of\r\ndrinking bad wine at a Strand tavern, and foretold the time of his death.\r\n\r\nA good story is told of Sir Theodore, which is the more curious because it\r\nrecords the fashionable fee of those days. A friend consulting Mayerne,\r\nand expecting to have the fee refused, ostentatiously placed on the table\r\ntwo gold broad pieces (value six-and-thirty shillings each). Looking\r\nrather mortified when Mayerne swept them into his pouch, “Sir.” said Sir\r\nTheodore, gravely, “I made my will this morning, and if it should become\r\nknown that I refused a fee the same afternoon I might be deemed _non\r\ncompos_.”[441]\r\n\r\nNear this fortunate doctor, honoured by kings, lived Sir John Finett, a\r\nwit and a song-writer, of Italian extraction. He became Master of the\r\nCeremonies to Charles I., and wrote a pedantic book on the treatment of\r\nambassadors, and other questions of precedency, of the gravest importance\r\nto courtiers, but to no one else. He died in 1641.\r\n\r\nTwo doors from Mayerne and five from Finett, from 1622 to 1634, lived\r\nDaniel Mytens, the Dutch painter. On Vandyke’s arrival Mytens grew jealous\r\nand asked leave to return to the Hague. But the king persuaded him to\r\nstay, and he became friendly with his rival, who painted his portrait.\r\nThere are pictures by this artist at Hampton Court. Prince Charles gave\r\nhim his house in the lane for twelve years at the peppercorn rent of 6d. a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nNext to Sir John Finett lived Sir Benjamin Rudyer, and on the same side\r\nAbraham Vanderoort, keeper of the pictures to Charles I., and necessarily\r\nan acquaintance of Mytens and Vandyke.\r\n\r\nCarew Raleigh, son of the great enemy of Spain, and born in the Tower,\r\nlived in this lane, on the west side, from 1636 to 1638, and again in\r\n1664. This unfortunate man spent all his life in writing to vindicate his\r\nfather’s memory, and in efforts to recover his Sherborne estate. In 1659,\r\nby the influence of General Monk, he was made Governor of Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe chivalrous wit, Sir John Suckling, dwelt in St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields\r\nin 1641, the year in which he joined in a rash plot to rescue Strafford\r\nfrom the Tower. He fled to France, and died there in poverty the same\r\nyear, in the thirty-second year of his age. Suckling had served in the\r\narmy of Gustavus Adolphus, and was famous for his sparkling repartee.\r\nThere is an exquisite quaint grace about his poem of “The Wedding,” which\r\nhas its scene at Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Willis, a great physician of his day, who died here in 1678,\r\nwas grandfather of Browne Willis, the antiquary. Dr. Willis was a friend\r\nof Wren, and a great anatomist and chemist. He mapped out the nerves very\r\nindustriously, and in his _Cerebri Anatome_ forestalled many future\r\nphrenological discoveries.[442]\r\n\r\nIn the same year that eccentric charlatan, Sir Kenelm Digby, was living in\r\nthe lane. The son of one of the gunpowder conspirators, and the\r\n“Mirandola” of his age, he was one of Ben Jonson’s adopted sons.[443] He\r\nwas generous to the poets; he understood ten or twelve languages; he\r\nshattered the Venetian galleys at Scanderoon; he studied chemistry, and\r\nprofessed to cure wounds with sympathetic powder. He held offices of\r\nhonour under Charles I., in France became a friend of Descartes, and after\r\nthe Restoration was an active member of the Royal Society. He was born,\r\nwon his naval victory, and died on the same day of the month. Ben Jonson,\r\nin a poem on him, calls him “prudent, valiant, just, and temperate,” and\r\nadds quaintly--\r\n\r\n  “His breast is a brave palace, a broad street,\r\n  Where all heroic ample thoughts do meet,\r\n  Where Nature such a large survey hath ta’en,\r\n  As others’ souls to _his dwelt in a lane_.”\r\n\r\nI cannot here help observing that the ridiculous story about Ben Jonson in\r\nhis old age refusing money from Charles I., and rudely sending back word\r\n“that the king’s soul dwelt in a lane,” must have originated in some\r\ncareless or malicious perversion of this line of the rough old poet’s.\r\n\r\n“Immortal Ben” wrote ten poems on the death of Sir Kenelm’s wife, who was\r\nthe daughter of Sir Edward Stanley, and, it is supposed, the mistress of\r\nthe Earl of Dorset. Randolph, Habington, and Feltham also wrote elegies on\r\nthis beautiful woman, who was found dead in her bed, accidentally\r\npoisoned, it is supposed, by viper wine, or some philtre or cosmetic given\r\nher by her experimentalising husband in order to heighten her beauty.[444]\r\nIn one of Ben Jonson’s poems there are the following incomparable verses\r\nabout Lady Venetia:--\r\n\r\n  “Draw first a cloud, all save her neck,\r\n  And out of that make day to break,\r\n  Till like her face it do appear,\r\n  And men may think all light rose there.”\r\n\r\nAnd again--\r\n\r\n  “Not swelling like the ocean proud,\r\n  But stooping gently as a cloud,\r\n  As smooth as oil pour’d forth, and calm\r\n  As showers, and sweet as drops of balm.”\r\n\r\nSir Kenelm, when imprisoned in Winchester House, in Southwark, wrote an\r\nattack on Sir Thomas Browne’s sceptical work _Religio Medici_. He also\r\nproduced a book on cookery, and a commentary on the _Faerie Queen_. This\r\nstrange being was buried in Christ Church, Newgate Street.\r\n\r\nSt. Martin’s-in-the-Fields is an ancient parish, but it was first made\r\nindependent of St. Margaret’s, Westminster, in 1535, by that tyrant Henry\r\nVIII., who, justly afraid of death, disliked the ceaseless black funeral\r\nprocessions of the outlying people of St. Martin’s passing the courtly\r\ngate of Whitehall, and who therefore erected a church near Charing Cross,\r\nand constituted its neighbourhood into a parish.[445] In 1607, that\r\nunfortunate youth of promise, Henry Prince of Wales, added a chancel to\r\nthe very small church, which soon proved insufficient for the growing and\r\npopulous suburb. But though so modern, this parish formerly included in\r\nits vast circle St. Paul’s Covent Garden, St. James’s Piccadilly, St.\r\nAnne’s Soho, and St. George’s Hanover Square. It extended its princely\r\ncircle as far north as Marylebone, as far south as Whitehall, as far east\r\nas the Savoy, and as far west as Chelsea and Kensington. When first rated\r\nto the poor in Queen Elizabeth’s time it contained less than a hundred\r\nrateable persons. The chief inhabitants lived by the river side or close\r\nto the church. Pall Mall and Piccadilly were then unnamed, and beyond the\r\nchurch westward were St. James’s Fields, Hay-hill Farm, Ebury Farm, and\r\nthe Neat houses about Chelsea.[446]\r\n\r\nIn 1638 this overgrown parish, had carved out of it the district of St.\r\nPaul’s, Covent Garden; in 1684, St. James’s, Westminster; and in 1686, St.\r\nAnne’s, Soho. But even in 1680, Richard Baxter, with brave fervour,\r\ndenounced what he called “the greatest cure in England,”[447] with its\r\npopulation of forty thousand more persons than the church could\r\nhold--people who “lived like Americans, without hearing a sermon for many\r\nyears.” From such parishes of course crept forth Dissenters of all creeds\r\nand colours. In 1826 the churchyard was removed to Camden Town, and the\r\nstreet widened, pursuant to 7 George IV. c. 77.\r\n\r\nThat shrewd native of Aberdeen, Gibbs--a not unworthy successor of\r\nWren--came to London at a fortunate time. Wren was fast dying; Vanbrugh\r\nwas neglected; there was room for a new architect, and no fear of\r\ncompetition. His first church, St. Martin’s, was a great success. Though\r\nits steeple was heavy and misplaced, and the exterior flat and without\r\nlight or shade,[448] the portico was foolishly compared to that of the\r\nParthenon, and was considered unique for dignity and unity of combination.\r\nThe interior was so constructed as to render the introduction of further\r\nornaments or of monuments impossible. Savage did but express the general\r\nopinion when he wrote with fine pathos--\r\n\r\n  “O Gibbs! whose art the solemn fanes can raise,\r\n  Where God delights to dwell and man to praise.”\r\n\r\nThe church was commenced in 1721 and finished in 1726, at a cost of\r\n£36,891: 10: 4, including £1500 for an organ.\r\n\r\nWith all its faults, it is certainly one of the finest buildings in\r\nLondon, next to St. Paul’s and the British Museum; but its cardinal fault\r\nis the unnatural union of the Gothic steeple and the Grecian portico. The\r\none style is Pagan, the other Christian; the one expresses a sensuous\r\ncontentment with this earth, the other mounts towards heaven with an\r\neternal aspiration. The steeple leaps like a fountain from among lesser\r\npinnacles that all point upwards. The Grecian portico is a cave of level\r\nshadow and of philosophic content.\r\n\r\nSt. Martin’s Church enshrines the dust of some illustrious persons. Here\r\nlies Nicholas Hilliard, the miniature-painter to Queen Elizabeth, and who\r\ndied in 1619. He was a very careful painter, in the manner of Holbein. The\r\ngreat Isaac Oliver was his pupil. He must have had some trouble with the\r\nmanly queen when she began to turn into a hag and to object to any shadow\r\nin her portraits. Near him, in 1621, was buried Paul Vansomer, a Flemish\r\npainter, celebrated for his portraits of James I. and his Danish queen.\r\nAnd here rests, too, a third and greater painter, William Dobson,\r\nVandyke’s protégé, who, born in an unlucky age, and forgotten amid the\r\ntumult of the Civil War, died in 1646, in poverty, in his house in St.\r\nMartin’s Lane. Dobson had been apprenticed to a picture-dealer, and was\r\ndiscovered in his obscurity by Vandyke, whose style he imitated, giving\r\nit, however, a richer colour and more solidity. Charles I. and Prince\r\nRupert both sat to him for their portraits. In this church reposes Sir\r\nTheodore Mayerne, an old court physician. His conserve of bats and\r\nscrapings of human skulls could not keep him from the earthy bed it seems.\r\nNicholas Stone, the sculptor, who died 1647, sleeps here (Stone’s son was\r\nCibber’s master), all unknown to the learned Thomas Stanley, who died in\r\n1678, and was known for his _History of Philosophy_ and translation of\r\nÆschylus. Here, also, is John Lacey--first a dancing-master, afterwards a\r\ntrooper, lastly a comedian. He died in 1681. Charles II. was a great\r\nadmirer of Lacey, but unfortunately more so of Nell Gwynn, who also came\r\nto sleep here in 1687. Poor Nell! with her good-nature and simple\r\nfrankness, she stands out, wanton and extravagant as she was, in pleasant\r\ncontrast with the proud painted wantons of that infamous court.\r\n\r\nIf the dead could shudder, Secretary Coventry, who was buried here the\r\nyear before Nell, must have shuddered at the neighbourhood in which he\r\nfound himself; for he was the son of Lord Keeper Coventry, who died at\r\nDurham House in 1639-40. He had been Commissioner to the Treasury, and had\r\ngiven his name to Coventry Street. This great person became a precedent of\r\nburial to the Hon. Robert Boyle. This wise and good man, whom Swift\r\nridiculed, was the inventor of the air-pump, and one of the great\r\npromoters of the Royal Society and of the Society for the Propagation of\r\nthe Gospel. He died in 1691, and his funeral sermon was preached by\r\nSwift’s _bête noir_, that fussy time-server, Bishop Burnet.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard lies a far inferior man, Sir John Birkenhead, who died\r\nin 1679. He was a great pamphlet-writer for the Royalists, and Lawes set\r\nsome of his verses to music.[449] He left directions that he should not be\r\nburied within the church, as coffins were often removed. In or out of the\r\nchurch was buried Rose, Charles II.’s gardener, the first man to grow a\r\npine-apple in England--a slice of which the king graciously handed to Mr.\r\nEvelyn.\r\n\r\nWorst of all--a scoundrel, and fool among sensible men--here lies the\r\nbully and murderer, Lord Mohun, who fell in a duel in Hyde Park with the\r\nDuke of Hamilton, immortalised in Mr. Thackeray’s _Esmond_. Mohun died\r\nin 1712. Here also, in 1721, came that vile and pretentious French\r\npainter, Louis Laguerre, whom Pope justly satirised. He was brought over\r\nby Verrio, and painted the “sprawling” “Labours of Hercules” at Hampton\r\nCourt. He died of apoplexy at Drury Lane Theatre. That clever and\r\ndetermined burglar, Jack Sheppard, is said to have been buried in St.\r\nMartin’s in 1724. Farquhar, the Irish dramatist, author of “The Beaux’\r\nStratagem,” was interred here in 1707. Roubilliac, the French sculptor,\r\nwho lived close by, was also buried in this spot, and Hogarth attended his\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nMr. J. T. Smith, author of the _Life of Nollekens_, speaking of his own\r\nvisits to the vaults of St. Martin’s Church, says, “It is a curious fact\r\nthat Mrs. Rudd requested to be placed near the coffins of the Perreaus.\r\nMelancholy as my visits to this vault have been, I frankly own that\r\npleasant recollections have almost invited me to sing, ‘Did you ne’er hear\r\nof a jolly young waterman?’ when passing by the coffin of my father’s old\r\nfriend, Charles Bannister.”[450]\r\n\r\nMr. F. Buckland that delightful writer on natural history, who visited the\r\nsame charnel-house in his search for the body of the great John Hunter,\r\ndescribes the vaults as piled with heaps of leaden coffins, horrible to\r\nevery sense; but as I write from memory, I will not give the ghastly\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThat indefatigable and too restless exposer of abuses, Daniel Defoe, wrote\r\na pamphlet in 1720 entitled “Parochial Tyranny; or, the Housekeeper’s\r\nComplaint against the Exactions of Select Vestries.” In this pamphlet he\r\npublished one of the bills of the vestry of St. Martin’s in 1713, which\r\ncontains the following impudent items:--\r\n\r\n  “Spent at May meetings or visitation         £65  0 4\r\n\r\n  Ditto at taverns, with ministers, justices,\r\n  overseers, &c.                                72 19 7\r\n\r\n  Sacrament bread and wine                      88 10 0\r\n\r\n  Paid towards a robbery                        21 14 0\r\n\r\n  Spent for dinner at the Mulberry Gardens      49 13 4”\r\n\r\nIn 1818 the churchwardens’ dinner cost £56: 18s. Archdeacon Potts’ sermon\r\non the death of Queen Charlotte not selling, the parish paid the loss,\r\n£48: 12: 9. In 1813 the vestry charged the parish £5 for petitioning\r\nagainst the Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe Thames watermen have a plot set apart for themselves in St. Martin’s\r\nChurchyard. These amphibious and pugnacious beings were formerly notorious\r\nfor their powers of sarcasm, though Dr. Johnson on a celebrated occasion\r\nput one of them out of countenance. In spite of coaches and sedan\r\nchairs--their horror in the times of the “Water Poet,” who must often have\r\nferried Shakspere over to the Globe Theatre at the Bankside--they\r\ncontinued till the days of omnibuses and cheap cabs, rowing and singing,\r\nrejoicing in their scarlet tunics, and skimming to and fro over the Thames\r\nlike swallows.\r\n\r\nThere is a Westminster tradition of a waterman who pretended to be deaf,\r\nand who was much employed by lovers, barristers who wished to air their\r\neloquence, and young M.P.s who wanted to recite their speeches\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 died Copper Holms, a well-known character on the river. He lived,\r\nwith his wife and children, somewhere along the shore in an ark, which he\r\nhad artfully framed from a West-country vessel, and which, coppers and\r\nall, cost him £150. The City brought an action to compel him to remove the\r\nobstruction. The honest fellow was buried in “The Waterman’s Churchyard,”\r\non the south side of St. Martin’s Church.[451]\r\n\r\nIn 1683 Dr. Thomas Tenison, vicar of the parish, afterwards Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, lived in this street; he died at Lambeth in 1715. He founded\r\nin this parish a school and library. Though Swift did say he was “hot and\r\nheavy as a tailor’s iron,” he seems to have been one of the best and most\r\ntolerant of men, notwithstanding he attacked Hobbes and Bellarmine with\r\nhis pen. He worked bravely during the plague, and was princely in his\r\ncharities during the dreadful winter of 1683. It was he who prepared\r\nMonmouth for death, and smoothed Queen Mary’s dying pillow. He was a\r\nsteady friend of William of Orange.\r\n\r\nTwo doors from Slaughter’s, on the west side, but lower down, lived\r\nAmbrose Philips, from 1720 to 1724. Pope laughed at his “Pastorals,” which\r\nhad been overpraised by Tickell. Though a friend of Addison and Steele,\r\nhis sprightly but effeminate copies of verses procured him from Henry\r\nCarey the name of “Namby Pamby.” His “Winter Scene,” a sketch of a Danish\r\nwinter, is, however, admirable.\r\n\r\nAmbrose Philips was laughed at for advertising in the _London Gazette_, of\r\nJanuary 1714, for contributions to a _Poetical Miscellany_. He was a\r\nLeicestershire man, and chiefly remarkable for translating Racine’s\r\n“Distressed Mother.” When the Whigs came into power under George I. he was\r\nput into the commission of the peace, and made a Commissioner of the\r\nLottery. He afterwards became Registrar of the Prerogative Court at\r\nDublin, wrote in the _Free Thinker_, and died in 1749. Pope laughed at the\r\nsmall poet as--\r\n\r\n  “The bard whom pilfered Pastorals renown,\r\n  Who turns a Persian tale for half-a-crown,\r\n  Just writes to make his barrenness appear,\r\n  And strains from hide-bound brains eight lines a year.”[452]\r\n\r\nIt was always one of Pope’s keenest strokes to call a man poor. Philips,\r\nin 1714, had industriously translated the _Thousand and One Days_, a\r\nseries of Persian tales, and gained very honourably earned money. The wasp\r\nof Twickenham, whose malice never grew old, sketched Philips again as\r\n“Macer,” a simple, harmless fellow, who borrowed ends of verse, and whose\r\nhighest ambition was “to wear red stockings and to dine with Steele.”\r\nAmbrose, naturally indignant to hear himself accused of stealing the\r\nlittle fame he had, very spiritedly hung up a birch at the bar of Button’s\r\nCoffee-house, with which he threatened to chastise the Æsop of the age if\r\nhe dared show himself, but Pope wisely stayed at home.[453]\r\n\r\nThe first house from the corner of Newport Street, on the right hand going\r\nto Charing Cross, was occupied by Beard, the celebrated public singer, who\r\nin 1738-9 married Lady Henrietta Herbert, the only daughter of the Earl\r\nWaldegrave. After her death the widower married the daughter of Mr. John\r\nRich, the inventor of English pantomime, the best harlequin that probably\r\never lived, and the patentee of Covent Garden Theatre from 1732 to 1762.\r\nThe parlour of the house had two windows facing the south towards Charing\r\nCross. Here Mr. J. T. Smith describes his father smoking a pipe with Beard\r\nand George Lambert, the latter the founder of the Beef-steak Club and the\r\nclever scene-painter of Covent Garden Theatre. The fire of 1808 destroyed\r\nmost of Lambert’s work with the theatre.[454]\r\n\r\nNext to this house stood “Old Slaughter’s” Coffee-house, the great haunt\r\nof artists from Hogarth to Wilkie. Towards the end of its existence it was\r\nthe head-quarters of naval and military officers before the establishment\r\nof West End Clubs. It was pulled down in 1844 to make way for the new\r\nstreet between Long Acre and Leicester Square. The original landlord, John\r\nSlaughter, started it in 1692, and died about 1740.[455] It first became\r\nknown as “Old Slaughter’s” in 1760, when an opposition set up in the\r\nstreet under the name of “Young” or “New Slaughter’s.”\r\n\r\nThere is a foolish tradition that the coffee-house derived its name from\r\nbeing frequented by the butchers of Newport Market. Mr. Smith gives a\r\ncharming chapter on the frequenters of this old haunt of Dryden and\r\nafterwards of Pope. The first he mentions was Mr. Ware, the architect, who\r\npublished a folio edition of Palladio, the great Italian architect of\r\nElizabeth’s time. Ware was originally a chimney-sweeper’s boy in Charles\r\nCourt, Strand; but being one day seen chalking houses on the front of\r\nWhitehall, a gentleman passing became his patron, educated him, and sent\r\nhim to Italy. His bust was one of Roubilliac’s best works. His skin is\r\nsaid to have retained the stain of soot to the day of his death.[456]\r\n\r\nGravelot, who kept a drawing-school in the Strand, nearly opposite\r\nSouthampton Street, was another frequenter of Old Slaughter’s. Henri\r\nFrançois Bourignon Gravelot was born in Paris in 1699, and died in that\r\ncity in 1773. His drawings were always minutely finished, and his designs\r\ntasteful, particularly those which he etched himself for Sir John Hanmer’s\r\nsmall edition of Shakspere. He found an excellent engraver in poor Charles\r\nGrignon, Le Bas’ pupil, who in his old age was driven off the field, fell\r\ninto poverty, and so remained till he died in 1810, aged 94.\r\n\r\nJohn Gwynn, the architect, who lived in Little Court, Castle Street,\r\nLeicester Fields, also frequented this house. He built the bridge at\r\nShrewsbury, and wrote a work on London improvements, which his friend Dr.\r\nJohnson revised and prefaced. The doctor also wrote strongly in favour of\r\nGwynn’s talent and integrity when he was unsuccessfully competing with\r\nMylne for the erection of old Blackfriars Bridge.\r\n\r\nHogarth, too, “used” Slaughter’s, and came there to rail at the “black old\r\nmasters,” the follies of patrons, and the knavery of dealers. Here he\r\nwould banter and brag, and sketch odd faces on his thumb-nail. Perhaps the\r\n“Midnight Conversation” was partly derived from convivial scenes in St.\r\nMartin’s Lane.\r\n\r\nRoubilliac, the eccentric French sculptor, was another habitué of the\r\nplace. His house and studio were opposite on the east side of the lane,\r\nand were approached by a long passage and gateway. Here his friends must\r\nhave listened to his rhapsodies in broken English about his great statues\r\nof Handel, Sir Isaac Newton, and that of Shakspere now at the British\r\nMuseum, which cost Garrick, who left it to the nation, three hundred\r\nguineas.[457]\r\n\r\nThat pompous and wretched portrait-painter, Hudson, Reynolds’s master and\r\nRichardson’s pupil, used also to frequent Slaughter’s. Hudson was the most\r\nignorant of painters, yet he was for a time the fashion. He painted the\r\nportraits of the members of the Dilettanti Society, and was a great and\r\nignorant collector of Rembrandt etchings. Hogarth used to call him, in his\r\nbrusque way, “a fat-headed fellow.”\r\n\r\nHere Hogarth would meet his own engraver, M’Ardell, who lived in Henrietta\r\nStreet. One of the finest English mezzotints in respect of brilliancy is\r\nHogarth’s portrait of Captain Coram, the brave old originator of the\r\nFoundling Hospital, by M’Ardell. His engravings after Reynolds are superb.\r\nThat painter himself said that they would immortalise him.[458]\r\n\r\nHere, also, came Luke Sullivan, another of Hogarth’s engravers, from the\r\nWhite Bear, Piccadilly. His etching of “The March to Finchley” is\r\nconsidered exquisite.[459] Sullivan was also an exquisite\r\nminiature-painter, particularly of female heads. He was a handsome,\r\nlively, reckless fellow, and died in miserable poverty.\r\n\r\nAt Slaughter’s, too, Hogarth must have met the unhappy Theodore Gardelle,\r\nthe miniature-painter, who afterwards murdered his landlady in the\r\nHaymarket and burnt her body. Hogarth is said to have sketched him in his\r\nghostly white cap on the day of his execution. Gardelle, like Greenacre,\r\npleaded that he killed the woman by an accidental blow, and then destroyed\r\nthe body in fear. Foote notices his gibbet in _The Mayor of Garratt_.\r\n\r\nOld Moser, keeper of the drawing academy in Peter’s Court--Roubilliac’s\r\nold rooms--was often to be seen at the same haunt. Moser was a German\r\nSwiss, a gold-chaser and enameller; he became keeper of the Royal Academy\r\nin 1768. His daughter painted flowers.\r\n\r\nThat great painter, poor old Richard Wilson, neglected and almost starved\r\nby the senseless art-patrons of his day, occasionally came to Slaughter’s,\r\nprobably to meet his countryman, blind Parry, the Welsh harper and great\r\ndraught-player.\r\n\r\nAnd, last of all, we must mention Nathanael Smith, the engraver, and Mr.\r\nRawle, the accoutrement maker in the Strand, and the inseparable companion\r\nof Captain Grose, the great antiquary, on whom Burns wrote poems--a\r\nlearned, fat, jovial Falstaff of a man, who compiled an indecorous but\r\nclever slang dictionary. It was at Rawle’s sale that Dickey Suett bought\r\nCharles II.’s black wig, which he wore for years in “Tom Thumb.”\r\n\r\nNos. 76 and 77 St. Martin’s Lane were originally one house, built by\r\nPayne, the architect of Salisbury Street and the original Lyceum. He built\r\ntwo small houses in his garden for his friends Gwynn, the competitor for\r\nBlackfriars Bridge, and Wale, the Royal Academy lecturer on perspective,\r\nand well-known book-illustrator. The entrances were in Little Court,\r\nCastle Street. In old times the street on this side, from Beard’s Court,\r\nto St. Martin’s Court, was called the Pavement; but the road has since\r\nbeen heightened three feet.\r\n\r\nBelow Payne’s, in Hogarth’s time, lived a bookseller named Harding, a\r\nseller of old prints, and author of a little book on the _Monograms of Old\r\nEngravers_. It was to this shop that Wilson, the sergeant painter, took an\r\netching of his own, which was sold to Hudson as a genuine Rembrandt. That\r\nsame night, by agreement, Wilson invited Hogarth and Hudson to supper.\r\nWhen the cold sirloin came in, Scott, the marine-painter, called out, “A\r\nsail, a sail!” for the beef was stuck with skewers bearing impressions of\r\nthe new Rembrandt, of which Hudson was so proud.[460]\r\n\r\nNos. 88 and 89 were built on the site of a large mansion, the staircase of\r\nwhich was adorned with allegorical figures. It was here that Hogarth’s\r\nparticular friend, John Pine, lived. Pine was the engraver and publisher\r\nof the scenes from the Armada tapestry in the House of Lords, now\r\ndestroyed. He was a round, fat, oily man; and Hogarth drew him, much to\r\nhis annoyance, as the fat friar eyeing the beef at the “Gate of Calais.”\r\nHis son Robert, who painted one of the best portraits of Garrick, and\r\ncarried off the hundred guinea prize of the Society of Arts for his\r\npicture of the “Siege of Calais,” also lived here, and, after him, Dr.\r\nGartshore.\r\n\r\nThe house No. 96, on the west side, was Powell the colourman’s in 1828; it\r\nhad then a Queen Anne door-frame, with spread-eagle and carved foliage and\r\nflowers, like the houses in Carey Street and Great Ormond Street, and a\r\nshutter sliding in grooves in the old-fashioned way. Mr. Powell’s mother\r\nmade for many years annually a pipe of wine from the produce of a vine\r\nnearly a hundred feet long.[461] This house had a large staircase, painted\r\nwith figures in procession, by a French artist named Clermont, who claimed\r\none thousand guineas for his work, and received five hundred. Behind the\r\nhouse was the room which Hogarth has painted in “Marriage à la Mode.” The\r\nquack is Dr. Misaubin, whose vile portrait the satirist has given. The\r\nsavage fat woman is his Irish wife. Dr. Misaubin, who lived in this house,\r\nwas the son of a pastor of the Spitalfields French Church. The quack\r\nrealised a great fortune by a famous pill. His son was murdered; his\r\ngrandson squandered his money, and died in St. Martin’s Workhouse.\r\n\r\nNo. 104 was at one time the residence of Sir James Thornhill, Hogarth’s\r\naugust father-in-law, a poor yet pretentious painter, who decorated St.\r\nPaul’s. He painted the staircase wall with allegories that were existing\r\nsome years since in good condition. The junior Van Nost, the sculptor,\r\nafterwards lived here--the same artist who took that mask of Garrick’s\r\nface which afterwards belonged to the elder Mathews. After him, before\r\n1768, came Hogarth’s convivial artist-friend, Francis Hayman, who\r\ndecorated Vauxhall and illustrated countless books. Perhaps it was here\r\nthat the Marquis of Granby, before sitting to the painter, had a round or\r\ntwo of sparring. Sir Joshua Reynolds, too, a graver and colder man, came\r\nto live here before he went to Great Newport Street.\r\n\r\nNew Slaughter’s, at No. 82 in 1828, was established about 1760, and was\r\ndemolished in 1843-44, when the new avenue of Garrick Street was made\r\nbetween Long Acre and Leicester Square. It was much frequented by artists\r\nwho wished cheap fare and good society. Roubilliac was often to be found\r\nhere. Wilkie long after enjoyed his frugal dinners here at a small cost.\r\nHe was always the last dropper-in, and was never seen to dine in the house\r\nbefore dark. The fact is, the patient young Scotchman always slaved at his\r\nart till the last glimpse of daylight had disappeared below the red roofs.\r\n\r\nUpon the site of the present Quakers’ Meeting-house in St. Peter’s Court,\r\nSt. Martin’s Lane, stood Roubilliac’s first studio after he left Cheere.\r\nHere he executed, with ecstatic raptures at his own genius, his great\r\nstatue of Handel for Vauxhall. Here afterwards a drawing academy was\r\nstarted, Mr. Michael Moser being chosen the keeper. Reynolds, Mortimer,\r\nNollekens, and M’Ardell were among the earliest members. Hogarth presented\r\nto it some of his father-in-law’s casts, but opposed the principle of\r\ncheap education to young artists, declaring that every foolish father\r\nwould send his boy there to keep him out of the streets, and so the\r\nprofession would be overstocked. In this academy the students sat to each\r\nother for drapery, and had also male and female models--sometimes in\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nAmongst the early members of the St. Martin’s Lane Academy were the\r\nfollowing:--Moser, afterwards keeper of the Academy; Hayman, Hogarth’s\r\nfriend; Wale, the book-illustrator; Cipriani, famous for his book-prints;\r\nAllan Ramsay, Reynolds’s rival; F. M. Newton; Charles Catton, the prince\r\nof coach-painters; Zoffany, the dramatic portrait-painter; Collins, the\r\nsculptor, who modelled Hayman’s “Don Quixote;” Jeremy Meyer; William\r\nWoollett, the great engraver; Anthony Walker, also an engraver; Linnel, a\r\ncarver in wood; John Mortimer, the Salvator Rosa of that day; Rubinstein,\r\na drapery-painter and drudge to the portrait-painters; James Paine, son of\r\nthe architect of the Lyceum; Tilly Kettle, who went to the East, painted\r\nseveral rajahs, and then died near Aleppo; William Pars, who was sent to\r\nGreece by the Dilettanti Society; Vandergutch, a painter who turned\r\npicture-dealer; Charles Grignon, the engraver; C. Norton, Charles\r\nSherlock, and Charles Bibb, also engravers; Richmond, Keeble, Evans,\r\nRoper, Parsons, and Black, now forgotten; Russell, the crayon-painter;\r\nRichmond Cosway, the miniature-painter, a fop and a mystic; W. Marlowe, a\r\nlandscape-painter; Messrs. Griggs, Rowe, Dubourg, Taylor, Dance, and\r\nRatcliffe, pupils of gay Frank Hayman; Richard Earlom, engraver of the\r\n“Liber Veritatis” of Claude for the Duke of Richmond; J. A. Gresse, a fat\r\nartist who taught the queen and princesses drawing; Giuseppe Marchi, an\r\nassistant of Reynolds; Thomas Beech; Lambert, a sculptor, and pupil of\r\nRoubilliac; Reed, another pupil of the same great artist, who aided in\r\nexecuting the skeleton on Mrs. Nightingale’s monument, and was famous for\r\nhis pancake clouds; Biaggio Rebecca, the decorator; Richard Wilson, the\r\ngreat landscape-painter; Terry, Lewis Lattifere, John Seton, David Martin,\r\nBurgess; Burch, the medallist; John Collett, an imitator of Hogarth;\r\nNollekens, the sculptor; Reynolds, and, of course, Hogarth himself, the\r\n_primum mobile_.[462]\r\n\r\nNo. 112 was in old times one of those apothecaries’ shops with bottled\r\nsnakes in the windows. It was kept by Leake, the inventor of a\r\n“diet-drink” once as famous as Lockyer’s pill.\r\n\r\nFrank Hayman, one of these St. Martin’s Lane worthies, was originally a\r\nscene-painter at Drury Lane. He was with Hogarth at Moll King’s when\r\nHogarth drew the girl squirting brandy at the other for his picture in the\r\n_Rake’s Progress_. Hayman was a Devonshire man, and a pupil of Brown. When\r\nhe buried his wife, a friend asked him why he spent so much money on the\r\nfuneral. “Oh, sir,” replied the droll, revelling fellow, “she would have\r\ndone as much or more for me with pleasure.”\r\n\r\nQuin and Hayman were inseparable boon companions. One night, after\r\n“beating the rounds,” they both fell into the kennel. Presently Hayman,\r\nsprawling out his shambling legs, kicked his bedfellow Quin. “Hallo! what\r\nare you at now?” growled the Welsh actor. “At? why, endeavouring to get\r\nup, to be sure, for this don’t suit my palate.” “Pooh!” replied Quin,\r\n“remain where you are; the watchman will come by shortly, and he will\r\n_take us both up_!”[463]\r\n\r\nNo. 113 was occupied by Thomas Major, a die-engraver to the Stamp Office,\r\na pupil of Le Bas, and an excellent reproducer of subjects from Teniers.\r\nHe was also an engraver of landscapes after pictures by Ferg, one of the\r\nartists employed with Sir James Thornhill at the Chelsea china\r\nmanufactory.\r\n\r\nThe old watch-house or round-house used to stand exactly opposite the\r\ncentre of the portico of Gibbs’s church.[464] There is a rare etching\r\nwhich represents its front during a riot. Stocks, elaborately carved with\r\nvigorous figures of a man being whipped by the hangman, stood near the\r\nwall of the watch-house. The carving, much mutilated, was preserved in the\r\nvaults under the church.\r\n\r\nNear the stocks, with an entrance from the King’s Mews, stood “the Barn,”\r\nafterwards called “the Canteen,” which was a great resort of the chess,\r\ndraught, and whist players of the City.\r\n\r\nAt the south-west corner of St. Martin’s Lane was the shop of Jefferys,\r\nthe geographer to King George III.\r\n\r\nNo. 20 was a public-house, latterly the Portobello, with Admiral Vernon’s\r\nship, well painted by Monamy, for its sign. The date, 1638, was on the\r\nfront of this house, now removed.\r\n\r\nNo. 114 stands on the site of the old house of the Earls of Salisbury.\r\nBefore the alterations of 1827 there were vestiges of the old building\r\nremaining. It has been a constant tradition in the lane, that in this\r\nhouse, in James II.’s reign, the seven bishops were lodged before they\r\nwere conveyed to the Tower.\r\n\r\nOpposite old Salisbury House stood a turnpike, and the tradition in the\r\nlane is that the Earl of Salisbury obtained its removal as a nuisance. At\r\nthat time the church was literally in the fields. The turnpike-house\r\nstood (circa 1760) on the site of No. 28, afterwards (in 1828) Pullen’s\r\nwine-vaults. The Westminster Fire Office was first established in St.\r\nMartin’s Lane, between Chandos Street and May’s Buildings.\r\n\r\nThe White Horse livery-stables were originally tea-gardens,[465] and south\r\nof these was a hop-garden. The oldest house in the lane overhung the White\r\nHorse stables, and was standing in 1828.\r\n\r\nNo. 60 was formerly Chippendale’s, the great upholsterer and\r\ncabinet-maker, whose folio work was the great authority in the trade\r\nbefore Mr. Hope’s classic style overthrew for a time that of Louis\r\nQuatorze.\r\n\r\nNo. 63 formerly led to Roubilliac’s studio. Here, in 1828, the Sunday\r\npaper _The Watchman_, was printed.\r\n\r\nIt must have been here, in the sculptor’s time, that Garrick, coming to\r\nsee how his Shakspere statue progressed, drew out a two-foot rule, and put\r\non a tragic and threatening face to frighten a great red-headed\r\nYorkshireman, who was sawing marble for Roubilliac; but who, to his\r\nsurprise, merely rolled his quid, and coolly said, “What trick are you\r\nafter next, my little master?” Upon the honest sculptor’s death, Read, one\r\nof his pupils, a conceited pretender, took the premises in 1762, and\r\nadvertised himself as “Mr. Roubilliac’s successor.”\r\n\r\nRead executed the poor monuments of the Duchess of Northumberland and of\r\nAdmiral Tyrrell, now in Westminster Abbey. His master used to say to Read\r\nwhen he was bragging, “Ven you do de monument, den de varld vill see vot\r\nvon d-- ting you vill make.” Nollekens used to say of the admiral’s\r\nmonument, “That figure going to heaven out of the sea looks for all the\r\nworld as if it were hanging from a gallows with a rope round its\r\nneck.”[466]\r\n\r\nNo. 70 was formerly the house where Mr. Hone held his exhibition when his\r\npicture of “The Conjuror,” intended to ridicule Sir Joshua Reynolds as a\r\nplagiarist, and to insult Miss Angelica Kaufmann, was refused admittance\r\nat Somerset House. Mr. Nathanael Hone was a miniature-painter on enamel,\r\nwho attempted oil pictures and grew envious of Reynolds. Hone was a tall,\r\npompous, big, erect man, who wore a broad brimmed hat and a lapelled coat,\r\npunctiliously buttoned up to his chin. He walked with a measured, stately\r\nstep, and spoke with an air of great self-importance--in this sort of way:\r\n“Joseph Nollekens, Esq., R.A., how--do--you--do?”[467]\r\n\r\nThe corner house of Long Acre, now 72, formed part of the extensive\r\npremises of Mr. Cobb, George III.’s upholsterer--a proud, pompous man, who\r\nalways strutted about his workshops in full dress. It was Dance’s portrait\r\nof Mr. Cobb, given in exchange for a table, that led to Dance’s\r\nacquaintance with Garrick. One day in the library at Buckingham House, old\r\nKing George asked Cobb to hand him a certain book. Instead of doing so,\r\nmistaken Cobb called to a man who was at work on a ladder, and said,\r\n“Fellow, give me that book.” The king instantly rose and asked the man’s\r\nname. “Jenkins,” replied the astonished upholsterer. “Then,” observed the\r\ngood old king, “Jenkins shall hand me the book.”[468]\r\n\r\nAlderman Boydell, the great encourager of art, when he first began with\r\nhalf a shop, used to etch small plates of landscapes in sets of six for\r\nsixpence. As there were few print-shops then in London, he prevailed upon\r\nthe proprietors of toy-shops to put them in their windows for sale. Every\r\nSaturday he went the round of the shops to see what had been done, or to\r\ntake more. His most successful shop was “The Cricket-Bat,” in Duke’s\r\nCourt, St. Martin’s Lane.[469]\r\n\r\nAbraham Raimbach, the engraver, was born in Cecil Court, St. Martin’s\r\nLane, in 1776. Sir Joshua Reynolds, in his early period, lived nearly\r\nopposite May’s Buildings. He afterwards went to Great Newport Street,\r\nwhere he first met Dr. Johnson.\r\n\r\nO’Keefe describes being in a coffee-house in St. Martin’s Lane on the very\r\nmorning when the famous No. 45 came out. The unconscious newsman came in,\r\nand, as a matter of course, laid the paper on the table before him. About\r\nthe year 1777 O’Keefe was standing talking with his brother at Charing\r\nCross, when a slender figure in a scarlet coat with a large bag, and\r\nfierce three-cocked hat, crossed the way, carefully choosing his steps,\r\nthe weather being wet--it was John Wilkes.[470]\r\n\r\nWhen Fuseli returned to London in 1779, after his foreign tour, he resided\r\nwith a portrait painter named Cartwright, at No. 100 St. Martin’s\r\nLane,[471] and he remained there till his marriage with Miss Rawlins in\r\n1788, when he removed to Foley Street. Here he commenced his acquaintance\r\nwith Professor Bonnycastle, and produced his popular picture of “The\r\nNightmare” (1781), by which the publisher of the print realised £500. Here\r\nalso he revised Cowper’s version of the _Iliad_, and became acquainted\r\nwith Sir Joshua Reynolds and Dr. Moore, the author of _Zeluco_.\r\n\r\nMay’s Buildings bear the date of 1739. Mr. May, who built them, lived at\r\nNo. 43, which he ornamented with pilasters and a cornice. This house used\r\nto be thought a good specimen of architectural brickwork.\r\n\r\nThe club of “The Eccentrics,” in May’s Buildings, was, in 1812, much\r\nfrequented by the eloquent Richard Lalor Sheil, by William Mudford, the\r\neditor of the _Courier_, a man of logical and sarcastic power,--and by\r\n“Pope Davis,” an artist, in later years a great friend of the unfortunate\r\nHaydon. “Pope Davis” was so called from having painted, when in Rome, a\r\nlarge picture of the “Presentation of the Shrewsbury Family to the\r\nPope.”[472]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society of Literature, at 4 St. Martin’s Place, Charing Cross,\r\nwas founded in 1823, “for the advancement of literature,” on which at\r\npresent it has certainly had no very perceptible influence. It was\r\nincorporated by royal charter Sept. 13, 1826. George IV. gave 1000 guineas\r\na year to this body, which rescued the last years of Coleridge’s wasted\r\nlife from utter dependence, and placed Dr. Jamieson above want. William\r\nIV. discontinued the lavish grant of a king who was generous only with\r\nother people’s money, and was always in debt; and since that the somewhat\r\neffete society has sunk into a Transaction Publishing Society, or rather a\r\nclub with an improving library. Sir Walter Scott’s opposition to the\r\nsociety was as determined as Hogarth’s against the Royal Academy. “The\r\nimmediate and direct favour of the sovereign,” said Scott, who had a\r\nsuperstitious respect for any monarch, “is worth the patronage of ten\r\nthousand societies.” Literature wants no patronage now, thank God, but\r\nonly intelligent purchasers; and whether a king does or does not read an\r\nauthor’s work, is of small consequence to any writer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD SLAUGHTER’S COFFEE-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nAdmission to the Royal Society of Literature is obtained by a certificate,\r\nsigned by three members, and an election by ballot. Ordinary members pay\r\nthree guineas on admission, and two guineas annually, or compound by a\r\npayment of twenty guineas. The society devotes itself for the most part to\r\nthe study of Greek and Latin inscriptions and Egyptian literature.[473]\r\nThis learned body also professes to fix the standard of the English\r\nlanguage; to read papers on history, poetry, philosophy, and philology; to\r\ncorrespond with learned men in foreign countries; to reward literary\r\nmerit; and to publish unedited remains of ancient literature.\r\n\r\nSt. Martin’s Lane has seen many changes. Cranbourne Alley is gone with all\r\nits bonnet-shops, and the Mews and C’ribbee Islands are no more, but there\r\nstill remain a few old houses, with brick pilasters and semi-Grecian\r\npediments, to remind us of the days of Fuseli and Reynolds, Hayman and Old\r\nSlaughter’s, Hogarth and Roubilliac. I can assure my readers that a most\r\nrespectable class of ghosts haunts the artist quarter in St. Martin’s\r\nLane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALISBURY AND WORCESTER HOUSES, 1630.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLONG ACRE AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the latter end of 1664, says Defoe, two men, said to be Frenchmen, died\r\nof the plague at the Drury Lane end of Long Acre. Dr. Hodges, however, a\r\ngreater authority than Defoe, who wrote fifty-seven years after the event,\r\nsays merely that the pestilence broke out in Westminster, and that two or\r\nthree persons dying, the frightened neighbours removed into the City, and\r\nthere carried the contagion. He, however, distinctly states that the pest\r\ncame to us from Holland, and most probably in a parcel of infected goods\r\nfrom Smyrna.[474]\r\n\r\nAccording to Defoe, the family with which the Frenchmen had lodged\r\nendeavoured to conceal the deaths; but the rumour growing, the Secretary\r\nof State heard of it, and sent two physicians and a surgeon to inspect the\r\nbodies. They certifying that the men had really died of the plague, the\r\nparish clerk returned the deaths to “the Hall,” and they were printed in\r\nthe weekly bill of mortality. “The people showed a great concern at this,\r\nand began to be alarmed all over the town.”[475] At Christmas Dr. Hodges\r\nattended a case of plague, and shortly afterwards a proclamation was\r\nissued for placing watchmen day and night at the doors of infected houses,\r\nwhich were to be marked with a red St. Andrew cross and the subscription\r\n“Lord have mercy upon us!”[476] By the next September the terrible disease\r\nhad risen to its height, and the deaths ranged as high as 12,000 a week,\r\nand in the worst night after the bonfires had been burned in the street,\r\nto 4000 in the twelve hours.[477]\r\n\r\nGreat Queen Street, so called after Henrietta Maria, the imprudent but\r\nbrave wife of Charles I., was built about 1629, before the troubles. Howes\r\n(editor of Stow) speaks in 1631, of “the new fair buildings leading into\r\nDrury Lane.”[478] Many of the houses were built by Webb, one of Inigo\r\nJones’s scholars. The south was the fashionable side, looking towards the\r\nPancras fields; most of the north side houses must, therefore, be of a\r\nlater date. According to one authority Inigo Jones himself built Queen\r\nStreet, at the cost of the Jesuits, designing it for a square, and leaving\r\nin the middle a niche for the statue of Queen Henrietta. “The stately and\r\nmagnificent houses,” begun on the other side near Little Queen Street,\r\nwere not continued. There were fleurs-de-luce placed on the walls in\r\nhonour of the queen.[479]\r\n\r\nGeorge Digby, the second Earl of Bristol, lived in Great Queen Street, in\r\na large house with seven rooms on a floor, a long gallery, and gardens.\r\nEvelyn describes going to see him (probably there), to consult about the\r\nsite of Greenwich Hospital, with Denham the poet and surveyor, and one of\r\nInigo Jones’s clerks. Digby was a Knight of the Garter, who first wrote\r\nagainst Popery and then converted himself. He persecuted Lord Strafford,\r\nyet then turning courtier, lived long enough to persecute Lord Clarendon.\r\nGrammont, Bussy, and Clarendon all decry the earl; and Horace Walpole\r\nwrites wittily of him--“With great parts, he always hurt himself and his\r\nfriends; with romantic bravery, he was always an unsuccessful commander.\r\nHe spoke for the Test Act, though a Roman Catholic, and addicted himself\r\nto astrology on the birthday of true philosophy.”[480]\r\n\r\nIn 1671 Evelyn describes the earl’s house as taken by the Commissioners of\r\nTrade and Plantations, of which he was one, and furnished with tapestry\r\n“of the king’s.” The Duke of Buckingham, the earl of Sandwich (Pepys’s\r\npatron), the Earl of Lauderdale, Sir John Finch, Waller the poet, and\r\nsaturnine Colonel Titus (the author of the terrible pamphlet against\r\nCromwell, _Killing no Murder_) were the new occupants.\r\n\r\nThey sat, says Evelyn, at the board in the council chamber, a very large\r\nroom furnished with atlases, maps, charts, and globes. The first day’s\r\ndebate was an ominous one: it related to the condition of New England,\r\nwhich had grown rich, strong, and “very independent as to their regard to\r\nOld England or his majesty. The colony was able to contest with all the\r\nother plantations,[481] and there was fear of her breaking from her\r\ndependence. Some of the council were for sending a menacing letter, but\r\nothers who better understood the peevish and touchy humour of that colony\r\nwere utterly against it.” A few weeks afterwards Evelyn was at the\r\ncouncil, when a letter was read from Jamaica, describing how Morgan, the\r\nWelsh buccaneer, had sacked and burned Panama; the bravest thing of the\r\nkind done since Drake. Morgan, who cheated his companions and stole their\r\nspoil, afterwards came to England, and was, like detestable Blood,\r\nreceived at court.\r\n\r\nLord Chancellor Finch, Earl of Nottingham, who lived in Great Queen\r\nStreet, presided as Lord High Steward at Lord Strafford’s trial, at which\r\nEvelyn was present, noticing the ill-bred impudence of Titus Oates.[482]\r\nFinch was the son of a recorder of London, and died in 1681. He was living\r\nhere when that impudent thief, Sadler, stole the mace and purse, and\r\ncarried them off in procession.\r\n\r\nThe choleric and Quixotic Lord Herbert of Cherbury lived in Great Queen\r\nStreet, in a house on the south side, a few doors east of Great Wyld\r\nStreet. Here he began his wild Deistic work, _De Veritate_, published in\r\nParis in 1624, and in London three years before his death. He says that he\r\nfinished this rhapsody in France, where it was praised by Tilenus, an\r\nArminian professor at Sedan, and an opponent of the Calvinists, which\r\nprocured him a pension from James I., and also from the learned Grotius\r\nwhen he came to Paris, after his escape in a linen-chest from the\r\nCalvinist fortress of Louvestein. Urged to publish by friends, Lord\r\nHerbert, afraid of the censure his book might receive, was relieved from\r\nhis doubts by what his vanity and heated imagination pleased to consider a\r\nvision from heaven.\r\n\r\nThis Welsh Quixote says, “Being thus doubtful in my chamber one fair day\r\nin the summer, my casement being open towards the south, the sun shining\r\nclear and no wind stirring, I took my book, _De Veritate_, in my hand, and\r\nkneeling on my knees, devoutly said these words: ‘Oh, thou eternal God,\r\nauthor of the light which now shines upon me, and giver of all inward\r\nilluminations, I do beseech thee of thy infinite goodness to pardon a\r\ngreater request than a sinner ought to make. I am not satisfied enough\r\nwhether I shall publish this book, _De Veritate_. If it be for thy glory,\r\nI beseech thee to give me some sign from heaven; if not, I shall suppress\r\nit!’ I had no sooner spoken these words, but a _loud though gentle\r\nnoise_[483] came from the heavens (for it was like nothing on earth),\r\nwhich did so comfort and cheer me that I took my petition as granted. And\r\nthis (however strange it may seem) I protest before the eternal God is\r\ntrue. Neither am I in any way superstitiously deceived herein, since I did\r\nnot only hear the noise, but in the serenest sky that ever I saw--being\r\nwithout _all_ cloud--did, to my thinking, see the place from whence it\r\ncame.”\r\n\r\nThe noise was probably some child falling from a chair overhead, or a\r\nchest of drawers being moved in an upper room; and if it _had_ been\r\nthunder in a clear sky, it was no more than Horace once heard. Heaven does\r\nnot often express its approval of Deistical books. Lord Herbert, doubted\r\nof general, and yet believed in individual revelation. What crazy vanity,\r\nto think the work of an amateur philosopher of sufficient importance for a\r\nspecial revelation,[484] that (in his own opinion) had been denied to a\r\nneglected world! Lord Herbert, though refused the sacrament by Usher, bore\r\nit very serenely, asked what o’clock it was, then said, “An hour hence I\r\nshall depart,” turned his head to the other side, and expired.[485] He had\r\nmoved to this quarter from King Street. Lord Herbert, though he wrote a\r\nLife to vindicate that brutal tyrant Henry VIII., was inconsistent enough\r\nto join the Parliament against a less wise but more illegal king, Charles\r\nI. When I pass down Queen Street, wondering whether that southern window\r\nof the Welsh knight’s vision was on the front of the south side, or on the\r\nback of the southern side of the street, I sometimes think of those soft\r\nlines of his upon the question “whether love should continue for ever?”\r\n\r\n  “Having interr’d her infant birth,\r\n  The watery ground that late did mourn\r\n  Was strew’d with flowers for the return\r\n  Of the wish’d bridegroom of the earth.\r\n\r\n  “The well-accorded birds did sing\r\n  Their hymns unto the pleasant time,\r\n  And in a sweet consorted chime,\r\n  Did welcome in the cheerful spring.”\r\n\r\nAnd then on my return home, I get out brave old Ben Jonson, and read his\r\nlines addressed to this last of the knights:--\r\n\r\n    “... and on whose every part\r\n  Truth might spend all her voice, Fame all her art.\r\n  Whether thy learning they would take, or wit,\r\n  Or valour, or thy judgment seasoning it,\r\n  Thy standing upright to thyself, thy ends\r\n  Like straight, thy piety to God and friends.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Fairfax, general of the Parliament, probably lived here, as he\r\ndated from this street a printed proclamation of the 12th of February\r\n1648.\r\n\r\nSir Godfrey Kneller, the great portrait painter of William and Mary’s\r\nreign, but more especially of Queen Anne’s time, once lived in a house in\r\nthis street. Sir Godfrey, though a humorist, was the vainest of men, and\r\nwas made rather a butt by his friends Pope and Gay. Kneller was the son of\r\na surveyor at Lübeck, and intended for the army. King George I., who\r\ncreated him a baronet, was the last of the sovereigns who sat to him. Sir\r\nGodfrey was the successor of Sir Peter Lely in England, but was still more\r\nslight and careless in manner. His portraits may be often known by the\r\ncurls being thrown behind the back, while in Lely’s portraits they fall\r\nover the shoulders and chest. Kneller was a humorist, but very vain, as a\r\nman might well be whom Dryden, Pope, Addison, Prior, Tickell, and Steele\r\nhad eulogised in verse. On one occasion, when Pope was sitting watching\r\nKneller paint, he determined to fool him “to the top of his bent.” “Do you\r\nnot think, Sir Godfrey,” said the little poet, slily, “that, if God had\r\nhad your advice at the creation, he would have made a much better world?”\r\nThe painter turned round sharply from his easel, fixed his eyes on Pope,\r\nand laying one hand on his deformed shoulder, replied, “Fore Gott, Mister\r\nPope, I theenk I shoode.”\r\n\r\nThere was wit in all Kneller’s banter, and even when his quaint sayings\r\ntold against himself, they seemed to reflect the humour of a man conscious\r\nof the ludicrous side of his own vanity. To his tailor who brought him his\r\nson to offer him as an apprentice emulative of Annibale Caracci, whose\r\nfather had also sat cross-legged, Sir Godfrey said, grandly, “Dost thou\r\nthink, man, I can make thy son a painter? No; God Almighty only makes\r\npainters.” To a low fellow whom he overheard cursing himself he said, “God\r\ndamn you? No, God may damn the Duke of Marlborough, and perhaps Sir\r\nGodfrey Kneller; but do you think he will take the trouble of damning such\r\na scoundrel as you?”[486]\r\n\r\nGay on one occasion read some verses to Sir Godfrey (probably those\r\ndescribing Pope’s imaginary welcome from Greece) in which these outrageous\r\nlines occur--\r\n\r\n  “What can the extent of his vast soul confine--\r\n  A painter, critic, engineer, divine?”\r\n\r\nUpon which Kneller, remembering that he had been intended for a soldier,\r\nand perhaps scenting out the joke, said, “Ay, Mr. Gay, all vot you ’ave\r\nsaid is very faine and very true, but you ’ave forgot von theeng, my good\r\nfriend. Egad, I should have been a general of an army, for ven I vos in\r\nVenice there vos a _girandole_, and all the Place of St. Mark vos in a\r\nsmoke of gunpowder, and I did like the smell, Mr. Gay--should have been a\r\ngreat general, Mr. Gay.”[487]\r\n\r\nHis dream, too, was related by Pope to Spence as a good story of the\r\nGerman’s droll vanity. Kneller thought he had ascended by a very high hill\r\nto heaven, and there found St. Peter at the gate, dealing with a vast\r\ncrowd of applicants. To one he said, “Of what sect was you?” “I was a\r\nPapist.” “Go you there.” “What was you?” “A Protestant.” “Go you there.”\r\n“And you?” “A Turk.” “Go you there.” In the meantime St. Luke had descried\r\nthe painter, and asking if he was not the famous Sir Godfrey Kneller,\r\nentered into conversation with him about his beloved art, so that Sir\r\nGodfrey quite forgot about St. Peter till he heard a voice behind him--St.\r\nPeter’s--call out, “Come in, Sir Godfrey, and take whatever place you\r\nlike.”[488]\r\n\r\nPope is said to have ridiculed his friend under the name of Helluo.[489]\r\nHe certainly laughed at his justice in dismissing a soldier who had stolen\r\na joint of meat, and blaming the butcher who had put it in the rogue’s\r\nway. Whenever he saw a constable, followed by a mob, coming up to his\r\nhouse at Whitton, he would call out to him, “Mr. Constable, you see that\r\nturning; go that way; you will find an ale-house, the sign of the King’s\r\nHead: go and make it up.”[490]\r\n\r\nJacob Tonson got pictures out of Kneller, covetous as he was, by praising\r\nhim extravagantly, and sending him haunches of fat venison and dozens of\r\ncool claret. Sir Godfrey used to say to Vandergucht, “Oh, my goot man,\r\nthis old Jacob loves me. He is a very goot man, for you see he loves me,\r\nhe sends me goot things. The venison vos fat.” Old Geckie, the surgeon,\r\nhowever, got a picture or two even cheaper, for he sent no present, but\r\nthen his praises were as fat as Jacob’s venison.[491]\r\n\r\nSir Godfrey used to get very angry if any doubt was expressed as to the\r\nlegitimacy of the Pretender. “His father and mother have sat to me about\r\nthirty-six times a-piece, and I know every line and bit of their faces.\r\nMine Gott, I could paint King James _now_ by memory. I say the child is so\r\nlike both, that there is not a feature in his face but what belongs to\r\neither father or mother--nay, the nails of his fingers are his\r\nmother’s--the queen that was. Doctor, you may be out in your letters, but\r\nI cannot be out in my lines.”[492]\r\n\r\nKneller had intended Hogarth’s father-in-law, Sir James Thornhill, to\r\npaint his staircase at Whitton, but hearing that Newton was sitting to\r\nhim, he was in dudgeon, declared that no portrait-painter should paint\r\nhis house, and employed “sprawling” Laguerre instead.\r\n\r\nKneller’s prices were fifteen guineas for a head, twenty if with only one\r\nhand, thirty for a half, and sixty for a whole length. He painted much too\r\nfast and flimsily, and far too much by the help of foreign assistants--in\r\nfact, avowedly to fill his kitchen. In thirty years he made a large\r\nfortune, in spite of losing £20,000 in the South Sea Bubble. His wigs,\r\ndrapery, and backgrounds were all painted for him. He is said to have left\r\nat his death 500 unfinished portraits.[493] His favourite work, the\r\nportrait of a Chinese converted and brought over by Couplet, a Jesuit, is\r\nat Windsor. But Walpole preferred his Grinling Gibbons at Houghton.\r\n\r\nKneller left his house in Great Queen Street to his wife, and after her\r\ndecease to his godson Godfrey Huckle, who took the name of Kneller.\r\nAmongst the celebrated persons painted by Kneller in his best manner were\r\nBolingbroke, Wren, Lady Wortley Montague, Pope, Locke, Burnet, Addison,\r\nEvelyn, and the Earl of Peterborough. The brittleness of this man’s fame\r\nis another proof that he who paints merely for his time must perish with\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nConway House was in Great Queen Street. Lord Conway, an able soldier,\r\nbrought up by Lord Vere, his uncle, was an epicure, who by his agreeable\r\nconversation was very acceptable at the court of Charles I.[494] He had\r\nthe misfortune to be utterly routed by the Scotch at Newburn--a defeat\r\nwhich gave them Newcastle. The previous Lord Conway was that Secretary of\r\nState of whom James I. said, “Steenie has given me two proper servants--a\r\nsecretary (Conway) who can neither write nor read, and a groom of the\r\nbedchamber (Mr. Clarke, a one-handed man) who cannot truss my\r\npoints.”[495] It had been well for England if this sottish pedant had had\r\nno worse servants than Conway and Clarke. Raleigh might then have been\r\nspared, and Overbuy would not have been poisoned.\r\n\r\nLord Conway, whose son, General Conway, was such an idol of Horace\r\nWalpole, lived in the family house in Great Queen Street.\r\n\r\nWinchester House was not far off. Lord Pawlet figures in all the early\r\nscenes of the Civil War. He was one of the first nobles to raise forces in\r\nthe West for the wrong-headed king. On one occasion Basing House was all\r\nbut lost by a plot hatched between Waller and the Marquis of Winchester’s\r\nbrother, but it was detected in time to save that important place. Basing,\r\nafter three months’ siege by a conjunction of Parliament troops from\r\nHampshire and Essex, was gallantly succoured by Colonel Gage. The\r\nMarchioness, a lady of great honour and alliance, being sister to the Earl\r\nof Essex and to the lady Marchioness of Hertford, enlisted all the Roman\r\nCatholics in Oxford in this dashing adventure.[496] Basing was, however,\r\neventually stormed and taken by Cromwell, who put most of the garrison to\r\nthe sword. William, the fourth marquis, died 1628, and was succeeded by\r\nhis son, who was the father of Charles, created in 1689 Duke of Bolton, a\r\ntitle that became extinct in 1794.\r\n\r\nJohn Greenhill, a Long Acre celebrity, was one of the most promising of\r\nLely’s scholars. He painted portraits, among others, of Locke,\r\nShaftesbury, and Davenant. He also drew in crayons, and engraved. It is\r\nsaid that Lely was jealous of him, and would not let his pupil see him\r\npaint, till Greenhill’s handsome wife was sent to Sir Peter to sit for her\r\nportrait, which cost twelve broad pieces or £15. Greenhill, at first\r\nindustrious, became acquainted with the players, and fell into debauched\r\ncourses. Coming home drunk late one night from the Vine Tavern, he fell\r\ninto the kennel in Long Acre, and was carried to Perrey Walton’s, the\r\nroyal picture-cleaner, in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where he had been lodging,\r\nand died in his bed that night (1676), in the flower of his age. He was\r\nburied at St. Giles’s, and shameless Mrs. Aphra Behn, who admired his\r\nperson and his paintings, wrote a long elegy on his death. Sir Peter is\r\nsaid to have settled £40 a year on Greenhill’s widow and children, but she\r\ndied mad soon after her husband.[497]\r\n\r\nIn June 1718 Ryan, an actor of Lincoln’s Inn Theatre, was supping at the\r\nSun in Long Acre, and had placed his sword quietly in the window, when a\r\nbully named Kelly came up and made passes at him, provoking him to a duel.\r\nThe young actor took his sword, drew it, and passed it through the\r\nrascal’s body. The act being one of obvious self-defence, he was not\r\ncalled to serious account for it. This Ryan had acted with Betterton.\r\nAddison especially selected him as Marcus in his “Cato,” and Garrick\r\nconfessed he took Ryan’s Richard as his model.[498]\r\n\r\nSome years after, Ryan, by this time the Orestes, Macduff, Iago, Cassio,\r\nand Captain Plume of the Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theatre, in passing down\r\nGreat Queen Street, after playing Scipio in “Sophonisba,” was fired at by\r\na footpad, and had his jaw shattered. “Friend,” moaned the wounded man,\r\n“you have killed me, but I forgive you.” The actor, however, recovered to\r\nresume his place upon the boards, and generous Quin gave him £1000 in\r\nadvance that he had put him down for in his will. He died in 1760.\r\n\r\nHudson, a wretched portrait-painter, although the master of Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds, lived in a house now divided into two, Nos. 55 and 56.\r\nPortrait-painting, being unable to sink lower than Hudson, turned and\r\nbegan to rise again. When Reynolds in later years took a villa on Richmond\r\nHill, somewhat above that of Hudson, he said, “I never thought I should\r\nlive to look down on my old master.” Hudson’s house was afterwards\r\noccupied by that insipid poet, Hoole, the translator of Tasso and of\r\nAriosto.\r\n\r\nThe old West End entrance of this street, a narrow passage known as the\r\n“Devil’s Gap,” was taken down in 1765.\r\n\r\nMartin Folkes, an eminent scholar and antiquarian, was born in Great Queen\r\nStreet in 1690. He was made vice-president of the Royal Society by Newton\r\nin 1723, and in 1727, on Sir Isaac’s death, disputed the presidentship\r\nwith Sir Hans Sloane,--a post which he eventually obtained in 1741, on the\r\nresignation of Sir Hans. Folkes was a great numismatist, and seems to\r\nhave been a generous, pleasant man. He died in 1784. The sale of his\r\nlibrary, prints, and coins lasted fifty-six days. He was, as Leigh Hunt\r\nremarks, one of “the earliest persons among the gentry to marry an\r\nactress,”[499] setting by that means an excellent example. His wife’s name\r\nwas Lucretia Bradshaw.\r\n\r\nMiss Pope, of Queen Street, had a face grave and unpromising, but her\r\nhumour was dry and racy as old sherry. Churchill, in the “Rosciad,”\r\nmentions her as vivaciously advancing in a jig to perform as Cherry and\r\nPolly Honeycomb. Later she grew into an excellent Mrs. Malaprop.[500]\r\n\r\nThis good woman, well-bred lady, and finished actress, lived for forty\r\nyears in Queen Street, two doors east of Freemasons’ Tavern; there, the\r\nMiss Prue, and Cherry, and Jacinta, and Miss Biddy of years before, the\r\nfriend of Garrick and the praised of Churchill, sat, surrounded by\r\nportraits of Lord Nuneham, General Churchill, Garrick, and Holland, and\r\ntold the story of her first love to Horace Smith.\r\n\r\nAn attachment had sprung up between her and Holland, but Garrick had\r\nwarned her of the man’s waywardness and instability. Miss Pope would not\r\nbelieve the accusations till one day, on her way to see Mrs. Clive at\r\nTwickenham, she beheld the unfaithful Holland in a boat with Mrs.\r\nBaddeley, near the Eel-pie Island. She accused him at the next rehearsal,\r\nhe would confess no wrong, and she never spoke to him again but on the\r\nstage. “But I have reason to know,” said the old lady, shedding tears as\r\nshe looked up at her cruel lover’s portrait, “that he never was really\r\nhappy.”\r\n\r\nMiss Pope left Queen Street at last, finding the Freemasons too noisy\r\nneighbours, especially after dinner. “Miss Pope,” says Hazlitt, “was the\r\nvery picture of a duenna or an antiquated dowager in the latter spring of\r\nbeauty--the second childhood of vanity; more quaint, fantastic, and\r\nold-fashioned, more pert, frothy, and light-headed than can be\r\nimagined.”[501]\r\n\r\nIt was not very easy to please poor soured Hazlitt, whose opinion of women\r\nhad not been improved by his having been jilted by a servant girl. This\r\ngood woman, Miss Pope, died at Hadley in 1801, her latter life having been\r\nembittered by the loss of her brother and favourite niece.\r\n\r\nThe Freemasons’ Hall, built by T. Sandby, architect, was opened in 1776,\r\nby Lord Petre, a Roman Catholic nobleman, with the usual mysterious\r\nceremonials of the order. The annual assemblies of the lodges had\r\npreviously been held in the halls of the City’s companies. The tavern was\r\nbuilt in 1786, by William Tyler, and has since been enlarged. In the\r\ntavern public meetings and dinners take place, chiefly in May and June.\r\nHere a farewell banquet was given to John Philip Kemble, and a public\r\ndinner on his birthday, to James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd. All the\r\nwaiters in this tavern are Masons. The house has been lately enlarged. Its\r\nnew great Hall was inaugurated by the dinner given to Charles Dickens by\r\nhis friends on his departure for America in November 1857.\r\n\r\nIsaac Sparkes, a famous Irish comedian about 1774, was an old, fat,\r\nunwieldy man, with a vast double chin, and large, bushy, prominent\r\neyebrows. When in London, he established in Long Acre a Club, which was\r\nfrequented by Lord Townshend, Lord Effingham, Lord Lindore, Captain\r\nMulcaster, Mr. Crewe of Cheshire, and “other nobles and fashionables.”\r\nSparkes, who dressed well and had a commanding presence, probably presided\r\nover it, as he did at Dublin clubs, dressed in robes as Lord Chief Justice\r\nJoker.[502]\r\n\r\nIn one of the grand old houses in Great Queen Street, on the right hand as\r\none goes towards Lincoln’s Inn Fields, occupied before 1830 by Messrs.\r\nAllman the booksellers, died Lewis the comedian, famous to the last, as\r\nLeigh Hunt tells us, for his invincible airiness and juvenility. “Mr.\r\nLewis,” says the same veteran play-goer, “displayed a combination rarely\r\nto be found in acting--that of the fop and the real gentleman. With a\r\nvoice, a manner, and a person all equally graceful and light, with\r\nfeatures at once whimsical and genteel, he played on the top of his\r\nprofession like a plume. He was the Mercutio of the age, in every sense of\r\nthe word mercurial. His airy, breathless voice, thrown to the audience\r\nbefore he appeared, was the signal of his winged animal spirits; and when\r\nhe gave a glance of his eye or touched with his finger another man’s ribs,\r\nit was the very _punctum saliens_ of playfulness and innuendo. We saw him\r\ntake leave of the public, a man of sixty-five, looking not more than half\r\nthe age, in the character of the Copper Captain; and heard him say, in a\r\nvoice broken with emotion, that for the space of thirty years he had not\r\nonce incurred their displeasure.”[503]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, when first in England, worked at the printing-office of\r\nMr. Watts, in Little Wild Street, after being employed for twelve months\r\nat one Palmer’s, in Bartholomew Close. He lodged close by in Duke Street,\r\nopposite the Roman Catholic Chapel, with a widow, to whom he paid\r\nthree-and-sixpence weekly. His landlady was a clergyman’s daughter, who\r\nhad married a Catholic, and abjured Protestantism. She and Franklin were\r\nmuch together, as he kept good hours and she was lame and almost confined\r\nto her room. Their frugal supper often consisted of nothing but half an\r\nanchovy, a small slice of bread and butter each, and half a pint of ale\r\nbetween them. On Franklin proposing to leave for cheaper lodgings, she\r\nconsented to let him retain his room at two shillings a week. In the attic\r\nof the house lived a voluntary nun. She was a lady who early in life had\r\nbeen sent to the Continent for her health, but unable to bear the climate,\r\nhad returned home to live in seclusion on £12 a year, devoting the rest of\r\nher income to charity, and subsisting, healthy and cheerful, on nothing\r\nbut water-gruel. Her presence was thought a blessing to the house, and\r\nseveral tenants in succession had charged her no rent. She permitted the\r\noccasional visits of Franklin and his landlady; and the brave American\r\nlad, while he pitied her superstition, felt confirmed in his frugality by\r\nher example.\r\n\r\nDuring his first weeks with Mr. Watts, Franklin worked as a pressman,\r\ndrinking only water while his companions had their five pints of porter\r\ndaily. The “Water American,” as he was called, was, however, stronger than\r\nhis colleagues, and tried to persuade some of them that strong beer was\r\nnot necessary for strong work. His argument was that bread contained more\r\nmaterials of strength than beer, and that it was only corn in the beer\r\nthat produced the strength in the liquid.\r\n\r\nBorn to be a reformer, Franklin persuaded the _chapel_ to alter some of\r\ntheir laws; he resisted impositions, and conciliated the respect of his\r\nfellows. He worked as a pressman, as he had done in America, for the sake\r\nof the exercise. He used, he tells us, to carry up and down stairs with\r\none hand a large _form_ of type, while the other fifty men required both\r\nhands to do the same work.\r\n\r\nFranklin’s fellow pressman drank every day a pint of beer before\r\nbreakfast, a pint with bread and cheese for breakfast, a pint between\r\nbreakfast and dinner, one at dinner, one again at six in the afternoon,\r\nand another after his day’s work; and all this he declared to be necessary\r\nto give him strength for the press. “This custom,” said the King of Common\r\nSense, “seemed to me abominable.” Franklin, however, failed to make a\r\nconvert of this man, and he went on paying his four or five shillings a\r\nweek for the “cursed beverage,” destined probably, poor devil, to remain\r\nall his life in a state of voluntary wretchedness, serfdom, and poverty.\r\n\r\nA few of the men consented to follow Franklin’s example, and renouncing\r\nbeer and cheese, to take for breakfast a basin of warm gruel, with butter,\r\ntoast, and nutmeg. This did not cost more than a pint of beer--“namely,\r\nthree halfpence”--and at the same time was more nourishing and kept the\r\nhead clearer. Those who gorged themselves with beer would sometimes run up\r\na score and come to the Water American for credit, “their light being\r\nout.” Franklin attended at the great stone table every Saturday evening to\r\ntake up the little debts, which sometimes amounted to thirty shillings a\r\nweek. “This circumstance,” says Franklin in his autobiography, “added to\r\nthe reputation of my being a tolerable _gabber_--or, in other words,\r\nskilful in the art of burlesque--kept up my importance in the ‘chapel.’ I\r\nhad, besides, recommended myself to the esteem of my master by my\r\nassiduous application to business, never observing ‘Saint’ Monday. My\r\nextraordinary quickness in composing always procured me such work as was\r\nmost urgent, and which is commonly best paid; and thus my time passed away\r\nin a very pleasant manner.”[504]\r\n\r\nFranklin, like a truly great man, was quietly proud of the humble origin\r\nfrom which he had risen; and when he came to England as the agent and\r\nambassador of Massachusetts, he paid a visit to his work-room in Wild\r\nStreet, and going to his old friend the press, said to the two workmen\r\nbusy at it, “Come, my friends, we will drink together; it is now forty\r\nyears since I worked like you at this very press as a journeyman printer.”\r\n\r\nWild House stood on the site of Little Wild Street. The Duchess of Ormond\r\nwas living there in 1655.[505]\r\n\r\nOn the day when King James II. escaped from London the mob grew unruly,\r\nand assembled in great force to pull down houses where either mass was\r\nsaid or priests lodged. Don Pietro Ronguillo, the Spanish ambassador, who\r\nlived at Wild House, and whom Evelyn mentions as having received him with\r\n“extraordinary civility” (March 26, 1681), had not thought it necessary to\r\nask for soldiers, though the rich Roman Catholics had sent him their money\r\nand plate as to a sanctuary, and the plate of the Chapel Royal was also in\r\nhis care. But the house was sacked without mercy; his noble library\r\nperished in the flames; the chapel was demolished; the pictures, rich\r\nbeds, and furniture were destroyed,--the poor Spaniard making his escape\r\nby a back door.[506] His only comfort was that the sacred Host in his\r\nchapel was rescued.[507]\r\n\r\nIn 1780 another savage and thievish Protestant mob, under Lord George\r\nGordon, assembled in St. George’s Fields to petition Parliament against\r\nthe Test Act, which relieved Roman Catholics from many vexatious penalties\r\nand unjust disabilities on condition of their taking their oaths of\r\nallegiance and disbelief in the infamous doctrines of the Jesuits. The mob\r\nassembled on the 2d of June, and jostled and insulted the Peers going to\r\nthe House of Lords. The same evening the people demolished the greater\r\npart of the Roman Catholic Chapel in Duke Street. On Monday they stripped\r\nthe house and shop of Mr. Maberly, of Little Queen Street, who had been a\r\nwitness at the trial of some rioters. On Tuesday they passed through Long\r\nAcre and burnt Newgate, releasing three hundred prisoners, and the same\r\nday destroyed the house of Justice Cox in Great Queen Street.[508] In\r\nthese street riots seventy-two private houses and four public gaols were\r\nburnt, and more than four hundred rioters perished.\r\n\r\nAt the above-named chapel Nollekens, the eminent sculptor, was baptized in\r\n1737. The present chapel is much resorted to on Sundays by the Irish poor\r\nand foreigners, who live about Drury Lane.\r\n\r\nNicholas Stone, the great monumental sculptor, lived in Long Acre. In 1619\r\nInigo Jones began the new Banqueting House at Whitehall, and replaced the\r\none destroyed by fire six months before. This master mason was Nicholas\r\nStone,[509] the sculptor of the fine monument to Sir Francis Vere in\r\nWestminster Abbey. His pay was 4s. 10d. a day. Stone also designed Dr.\r\nDonne’s splendid monument in St. Paul’s. Roubilliac was a great admirer of\r\nthe kneeling knight at the north-west corner of Vere’s tomb. He used to\r\nstand and watch it, and say, “Hush! hush! he vill speak presently.” Mr. J.\r\nT. Smith seems to think that the Shakspere monument at Stratford is in\r\nthis sculptor’s manner.[510] Inigo Jones, who had been fined for having\r\nborne arms at the siege of Basing House, joined with Nicholas Stone in\r\nburying their money near Inigo’s house in Scotland Yard; but as the\r\nParliament encouraged servants to betray such hidden treasures, the\r\npartners removed their money and hid it again with their own hands in\r\nLambeth Marsh.\r\n\r\nOliver Cromwell, when member for Cambridge, lived from 1637 to 1643, on\r\nthe south side of Long Acre, two doors from Nicholas Stone the sculptor.\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor, the “Water-Poet” an eccentric poetaster, kept a public-house\r\nin Phœnix Alley, now Hanover Court, near Long Acre. He was a Thames\r\nwaterman, who had fought at the taking of Cadiz, and afterwards travelled\r\nto Germany and Scotland as a servant to Sir William Waade. He was then\r\nmade collector of the wine-dues for the lieutenant of the Tower, and wrote\r\na life of Old Parr, and sixty-three volumes of satire and jingling\r\ndoggerel, not altogether without vivacity and vigour. He called himself\r\n“the King’s Water Poet” and “the Queen’s Waterman;” and in 1623 wrote a\r\ntract called “The World runs on Wheels”--a violent attack on the use of\r\ncoaches. “I dare truly affirm,” says the writer, “that every day in any\r\nterm (especially if the court be at Whitehall) they do rob us of our\r\nlivings and carry five hundred and sixty fares daily from us.” In this\r\nquaint pamphlet Taylor gives a humorous account of his once riding in his\r\nmaster’s coach from Whitehall to the Tower. “Before I had been drawn\r\ntwenty yards,” he says, “such a timpany of pride puft me up that I was\r\nready to burst with the wind-cholic of vaine glory.” He complains\r\nparticularly of the streets and lanes being blocked with carriages,\r\nespecially Blackfriars and Fleet Street or the Strand after a masque or\r\nplay at court; the noise deafening every one and souring the beer, to the\r\ninjury of the public health. It is Taylor who mentions that William\r\nBoonen, a Dutchman, first introduced coaches into England in 1564, and\r\nbecame Queen Elizabeth’s coachman. “It is,” he says, “a doubtful question\r\nwhether the devil brought tobacco into England in a coach, or brought a\r\ncoach in a fog or mist of tobacco.” Nor did Taylor rest there, for he\r\npresented a petition to James I., which was submitted to Sir Francis\r\nBacon and other commissioners, to compel all play-houses to stand on the\r\nBankside, so as to give more work to watermen. In the Civil War, Taylor\r\nwent to Oxford and wrote ballads for the king. On his return to London, he\r\nsettled in Long Acre with a mourning crown for a sign;[511] but the\r\nPuritans resenting this emblem, he had his own portrait painted instead\r\nwith this motto--\r\n\r\n  “There’s many a head stands for a sign:\r\n  Then, gentle reader, why not mine?”\r\n\r\nTaylor was born in 1580, and died in 1654; and the following epitaph was\r\nwritten on the vain, honest fellow, who was buried at St.\r\nMartin’s-in-the-Fields:--\r\n\r\n  “Here lies the Water-poet, honest John,\r\n  Who rowed on the streams of Helicon;\r\n  Where having many rocks and dangers past,\r\n  He at the haven of Heaven arrived at last.”[512]\r\n\r\nFrom 1682 to 1686 John Dryden lived in Long Acre, on the north side, in a\r\nhouse facing what formerly was Rose Street. His name appears in the\r\nrate-books as “John Dryden, Esq.”--an unusual distinction--and the sum he\r\npaid to the poor varied from 18s. to £1.[513] It was here he resided when\r\nhe was beaten, one December evening in 1679, by three ruffians hired by\r\nthe Earl of Rochester and the Duchess of Portsmouth. Sir Walter Scott\r\nmakes the poet live at the time in Gerard Street; but no part of Gerard\r\nStreet was built in 1679. Rochester had the year before ridiculed Dryden\r\nas “Poet Squab,” and believed that Dryden had helped Mulgrave in\r\nridiculing him in his clumsy “Essay on Satire.” The best lines of this\r\ndull poem are these:--\r\n\r\n  “Of fighting sparks Fame may her pleasure say,\r\n  But ’tis a bolder thing to run away.\r\n  The world may well forgive him all his ill,\r\n  For every fault does prove his penance still;\r\n  Falsely he falls into some dangerous noose,\r\n  And then as meanly labours to get loose.”\r\n\r\nA letter from Rochester to a friend, dated November 21, in the above year,\r\nis still extant, in which he names Dryden as the author of the satire, and\r\nconcludes with the following threat:--“If he (Dryden) falls on me at the\r\nblunt, which is his very good weapon in wit, I will forgive him, if you\r\nplease, and _leave the repartee to Black Will with a cudgel_.”[514]\r\n\r\nDryden offered a reward of fifty pounds for the discovery of the men who\r\ncudgelled him, depositing the money in the hands of “Mr. Blanchard,\r\ngoldsmith, next door to Temple Bar,” but all in vain. The Rose Alley\r\nsatire, the Rose Alley ambuscade, and the Dryden salutation, became\r\nestablished jokes with Dryden’s countless enemies. Even Mulgrave himself,\r\nin his _Art of Poetry_ said of Dryden coldly--\r\n\r\n  “Though praised and punished for another’s rhymes,\r\n  His own deserve as great applause sometimes.”\r\n\r\nAnd, in a conceited note, the amateur poet described the libel as one for\r\nwhich Dryden had been unjustly “_applauded and wounded_.” But these lines\r\nand this note Mulgrave afterwards suppressed.\r\n\r\nPoor Otway, whom Rochester had satirised, and who had accused Dryden of\r\nsaying of his _Don Carlos_ that, “Egad, there was not a line in it he\r\nwould be author of,” stood up bravely for Dryden as an honest satirist in\r\nthese vigorous verses:--\r\n\r\n  “Poets in honour of the truth should write,\r\n  With the same spirit brave men for it fight.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  From any private cause where malice reigns,\r\n  Or general pique all blockheads have to brains.”\r\n\r\nDryden never took any poetical revenge on Rochester, and in the prefatory\r\nessay to his _Juvenal_ he takes credit for that forbearance.[515]\r\n\r\nEdward (more generally known as Ned) Ward was the landlord of\r\npublic-houses alternately in Moorfields, Clerkenwell, Fulwood’s Rents, and\r\nLong Acre. He was born in 1667, and died 1731. He was a High Tory, and\r\nfond of the society of poets and authors.[516] Attacked in the _Dunciad_,\r\nhe turned _Don Quixote_ into Hudibrastic verse, and wrote endless songs,\r\nlampoons, coarse clever satires, and _Dialogues on Matrimony_ (1710).\r\n\r\nThe father of Pepys’s long-suffering wife lived in Long Acre; and the\r\nbustling official describes, with a stultifying exactitude, his horror at\r\na visit which he found himself forced to pay to a house surrounded by\r\ntaverns.\r\n\r\nDr. Arbuthnot, in a letter to Mr. Watkins, gives Bessy Cox--a woman in\r\nLong Acre whom Prior would have married when her husband died--a\r\ndetestable character. The infatuated poet left his estate between his old\r\nservant Jonathan Drift, and this woman, who boasted that she was the\r\npoet’s Emma,--another virago, Flanders Jane, being his Chloe.[517]\r\n\r\nIt is said of this careless, pleasant poet, that after spending an\r\nintellectual evening with Oxford, Bolingbroke, Pope, and Swift, in order\r\nto unbend, he would smoke a pipe and drink a bottle of ale with a common\r\nsoldier and his wife in Long Acre. Cibber calls the man a butcher;[518]\r\nother writers make him a cobbler or a tavern-keeper, which is more likely.\r\nThe shameless husband is said to have been proud of the poet’s preference\r\nfor his wife. Pope, who was remorseless at the failings of friends, calls\r\nthe woman a wretch, and said to Spence, “Prior was not a right good man;\r\nhe used to bury himself for whole days and nights together with this poor\r\nmean creature, and often drank hard.” This person, who perhaps is\r\nmisrepresented--and where there is a doubt the prisoner at the bar should\r\nalways have the benefit of it--was the Venus of the poet’s verse. To her\r\nPrior wrote, after Walpole tried to impeach him:--\r\n\r\n  “From public noise and faction’s strife,\r\n  From all the busy ills of life,\r\n  Take me, my Chloe, to thy breast,\r\n  And lull my wearied soul to rest.\r\n\r\n  “For ever in this humble cell [ale-house]\r\n  Let thee and I [me], my fair one, dwell;\r\n  None enter else but Love, and he\r\n  Shall bar the door and keep the key.”\r\n\r\nPrior was the son of a joiner,[519] and was brought up, as before\r\nmentioned, by his uncle, a tavern-keeper at Charing Cross, where the\r\nclever waiter’s knowledge of Horace led to his being sent to college by\r\nthe Earl of Dorset. Abandoning literature, he finally became our\r\nambassador to France. He died in retirement in 1721.\r\n\r\nIt was in a poor shoemaker’s small window in Long Acre,--half of it\r\ndevoted to boots, half to pictures--that poor starving Wilson’s fine\r\nclassical landscapes were exposed, often vainly, for sale. Here, from his\r\nmiserable garret in Tottenham Court Road, the great painter, peevish and\r\nsoured by neglect, would come swearing at his rivals Barret and Smith of\r\nChichester. I can imagine him, with his tall, burly figure, his red face,\r\nand his enormous nose, striding out of the shop, thirsting for porter, and\r\nmuttering that, if the pictures of Wright of Derby had fire, his had air.\r\nYet this great painter, whose works are so majestic and glowing, so fresh,\r\nairy, broad, and harmonious, was all but starved. The king refused to\r\npurchase his “Kew Gardens,” and the very pawnbrokers grew weary of taking\r\nhis Tivolis and Niobes as pledges, far preferring violins, flat-irons, or\r\ntelescopes.\r\n\r\nIt was in Long Acre that that delightful idyllic painter, Stothard, was\r\nborn in 1755. His father, a Yorkshireman, kept an inn in the street.[520]\r\nSent for his health into Yorkshire, and placed with an old lady who had\r\nsome choice engravings, he began to draw. The first subject that he ever\r\npainted was executed with an oyster-shell full of black paint, borrowed\r\nfrom the village plumber and glazier. This little man was the father of\r\nmany a Watteau lover and tripping Boccaccio nymph. That genial and\r\ngraceful artist, who illustrated Chaucer, _Robinson Crusoe_, and _The\r\nPilgrim’s Progress_, had the road to fame pointed out to him first by\r\nthat little black man.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of King George I. the Tories had such sway over the\r\nLondon mobs, that the friends of the Protestant succession resolved to\r\nfound cheap tavern clubs in various parts of the City in order that\r\nwell-affected tradesmen might meet to keep up their spirit of loyalty, and\r\nserve as focus-points of resistance in case of Tory tumults.\r\n\r\nDefoe, a staunch Whig, describes one of these assemblies in Long Acre,\r\nwhich probably suggested the rest. At the Mughouse Club in Long Acre,\r\nabout a hundred gentlemen, lawyers, and tradesmen met in a large room, at\r\nseven o’clock on Wednesday and Saturday evenings in the winter, and broke\r\nup soon after ten. A grave old gentleman, “in his own grey hairs,”[521]\r\nand within a few months of ninety, was the president, and sat in an\r\n“armed” chair, raised some steps above the rest of the company, to keep\r\nthe room in order. A harp was played all the time at the lower end of the\r\nroom, and every now and then one of the company rose and entertained the\r\nrest with a song. Nothing was drunk but ale, and every one chalked his\r\nscore on the table beside him. What with the songs and drinking healths\r\nfrom one table to another, there was no room for politics or anything that\r\ncould sour conversation. The members of these clubs retired when they\r\npleased, as from a coffee-house.\r\n\r\nOld Sir Hans Sloane’s coach, made by John Aubrey, Queen Anne’s coachmaker,\r\nin Long Acre, and given to him by her for curing her of a fit of the gout,\r\nwas given by Sir Hans to his old butler, who set up the White Horse Inn\r\nbehind Chelsea Church, where it remained for half a century.[522]\r\n\r\nCharles Catton, one of the early Academicians, was originally a coach and\r\nsign painter. He painted a lion as a sign for his friend, a celebrated\r\ncoachmaker, at that time living in Long Acre.[523] A sign painted by\r\nClarkson, that hung at the north-east corner of Little Russell Street\r\nabout 1780, was said to have cost £500, and crowds used to collect to\r\nlook at it.\r\n\r\nLord William Russell was led from Holborn into Little Queen Street on his\r\nway to the scaffold in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. As the coach turned into this\r\nstreet, Lord Russell said to Tillotson, “I have often turned to the other\r\nhand with great comfort, but I now turn to this with greater.” He referred\r\nto Southampton House, on the opposite side of Holborn, which he inherited\r\nthrough his brave and good wife, the grand-daughter of Shakspere’s early\r\npatron.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1796 Charles Lamb resided with his father, mother, aunt, and\r\nsister in lodgings at No. 7 Little Queen Street, a house, I believe,\r\nremoved to make way for the church. Southey describes a call which he made\r\non them there in 1794-5. The father had once published a small quarto\r\nvolume of poetry, of which “The Sparrow’s Wedding” was his favourite, and\r\nCharles used to delight him by reading this to him when he was in his\r\ndotage. In 1797 Lamb published his first verses. His father, the\r\nex-servant and companion of an old Bencher in the Temple, was sinking into\r\nthe grave; his mother had lost the use of her limbs, and his sister was\r\nemployed by day in needlework, and by night in watching her mother. Lamb,\r\njust twenty-one years old, was a clerk in the India House. On the 22d of\r\nSeptember[524] Miss Lamb, who had been deranged some years before by\r\nnervous fatigue, seized a case-knife while dinner was preparing, chased a\r\nlittle girl, her apprentice, round the room, and on her mother calling to\r\nher to forbear, stabbed her to the heart. Lamb arrived only in time to\r\nsnatch the knife from his sister’s hand. He had that morning been to\r\nconsult a doctor, but had not found him at home. The verdict at the\r\ninquest was “Insanity,” and Mary Lamb was sent to a mad-house, where she\r\nsoon recovered her reason. Poor Lamb’s father and aunt did not long\r\nsurvive. Not long after, Lamb himself was for six weeks confined in an\r\nasylum. There is extant a terrible letter in which he describes rushing\r\nfrom a party of friends who were supping with him soon after the horrible\r\ncatastrophe, and in an agony of regret falling on his knees by his\r\nmother’s coffin, asking forgiveness of Heaven for forgetting her so\r\nsoon.[525]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that poor Lamb played the sot over his nightly grog; but\r\nhe had a noble soul, and let us be lenient with such a man--\r\n\r\n  “Be to his faults a little blind,\r\n  And to his virtues very kind.”\r\n\r\nHe abandoned her whom he loved, together with all meaner ambitions, and\r\ndrudged his years away as a poor, ignoble clerk, in order to maintain his\r\nhalf-crazed sister; for this purpose--true knight that he was, though he\r\nnever drew sword--he gave all that he had--HIS LIFE! Peace, then! peace be\r\nto his ashes!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LYON’S INN, 1804.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRAVEN HOUSE, 1790]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nDRURY LANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roll of Battle Abbey tells us that the founder of the Drury family\r\ncame into England with that brave Norman robber, the Conqueror, and\r\nsettled in Suffolk.[526]\r\n\r\nFrom this house branched off the Druries of Hawstead, in the same county,\r\nwho built Drury House in the time of Elizabeth. It stood a little behind\r\nthe site of the present Olympic Theatre. Of another branch of the same\r\nfamily was that Sir Drue Drury, who, together with Sir Amias Powlett, had\r\nat one time the custody of Mary, Queen of Scots.\r\n\r\nDrury Lane takes its name from a house probably built by Sir William\r\nDrury, a Knight of the Garter, and a most able commander in the desultory\r\nIrish wars during the reign of Elizabeth, who fell in a duel with John\r\nBurroughs, fought to settle a foolish quarrel about some punctilio of\r\nprecedency.[527] In this house, in 1600, the imprudent friends of rash\r\nEssex resolved on the fatal outbreak that ended so lamentably at Ludgate.\r\nThe Earl of Southampton then resided there.[528] The plots of Blount,\r\nDavis, Davers, etc., were communicated to Essex by letter. It was noticed\r\nthat at his trial the earl betrayed agitation at the mention of Drury\r\nHouse, though he had carefully destroyed all suspicious papers.\r\n\r\nSir William’s son Robert was a patron of Dr. Donne, the religious poet and\r\nsatirist, who in 1611 had apartments assigned to him and his wife in Drury\r\nHouse. Donne, though the son of a man of some fortune, was foolish enough\r\nto squander his money when young, and in advanced life was so wanting in\r\nself-respect as to live about in other men’s houses, paying for his food\r\nand lodging by his wit and conversation. He lived first with Lord\r\nChancellor Egerton, Bacon’s predecessor, afterwards at Drury House and\r\nwith Sir Francis Wooley at Pitford, in Surrey. After his clandestine\r\nmarriage with Lady Ellesmere’s niece, Donne’s life was for some time a\r\nhard and troublesome one.\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert Drury,” says Isaac Walton, “a gentleman of a very noble estate\r\nand a more liberal mind, assigned Donne and his wife a useful apartment in\r\nhis own large house in Drury Lane, and rent free; he was also a cherisher\r\nof his studies, and such a friend as sympathised with him and his in all\r\ntheir joys and sorrows.”[529]\r\n\r\nSir Robert, wishing to attend Lord Hay as King James’s ambassador at his\r\naudiences in Paris with Henry IV., begged Donne to accompany him. But the\r\npoet refused, his wife being at the time near her confinement and in poor\r\nhealth, and saying that “her divining soul boded some ill in his absence.”\r\nBut Sir Robert growing more urgent, and Donne unwilling to refuse his\r\ngenerous friend a request, at last obtained from his wife a faint consent\r\nfor a two months’ absence. On the twelfth day the party reached Paris. Two\r\ndays afterwards Donne was left alone in the room where Sir Robert and\r\nother friends had dined. Half an hour afterwards Sir Robert returned, and\r\nfound Mr. Donne still alone, “but in such an ecstasy, and so altered in\r\nhis looks,” as amazed him. After a long and perplexed pause, Donne said,\r\n“I have had a dreadful vision since I saw you; I have seen my dear wife\r\npass by me twice in this room with her hair hanging about her shoulders\r\nand a dead child in her arms;” to which Sir Robert replied, “Sure, sir,\r\nyou have slept since I saw you, and this is the result of some melancholy\r\ndream, which I desire you to forget, for you are now awake.” Donne assured\r\nhis friend that he had not been asleep, and that on the second appearance\r\nhis wife stopped, looked him in the face, and then vanished.\r\n\r\nThe next day, however, neither rest nor sleep had altered Mr. Donne’s\r\nopinion, and he repeated the story with only a more deliberate and\r\nconfirmed confidence. All this inclining Sir Robert to some faint belief,\r\nhe instantly sent off a servant to Drury House to bring him word in what\r\ncondition Mrs. Donne was. The messenger returned in due time, saying that\r\nhe had found Mrs. Donne very sad and sick in bed, and that after a long\r\nand dangerous labour she had been delivered of a dead child; and upon\r\nexamination, the delivery proved to have been at the very day and hour in\r\nwhich Donne had seen the vision. Walton is proud of this late miracle, so\r\neasily explainable by natural causes; and illustrates the sympathy of\r\nsouls by the story of two lutes, one of which, if both are tuned to the\r\nsame pitch, will, though untouched, echo the other when it is played.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to wish to ridicule any man’s belief in the\r\nsupernatural; but still, as a lover of truth, wishing to believe what\r\n_is_, whether natural or supernatural, without confusing the former with\r\nthe latter, let me analyse this pictured presentiment. An imaginative man,\r\nagainst his sick wife’s wish, undertakes a perilous journey. Absent from\r\nher--alone--after wine and friendly revel feeling still more lonely--in\r\nthe twilight he thinks of home and the wife he loves so much. Dreaming,\r\nthough awake, his fears resolve themselves into a vision, seen by the\r\nmind, and to the eye apparently vivid as reality. The day and hour happen\r\nto correspond, or he persuades himself afterwards that they do correspond\r\nwith the result, and the day-dream is henceforward ranked among\r\nsupernatural visions. Who is there candid enough to write down the\r\npresentiments that do not come true? And after all, the vision, to be\r\nconsistent, should have been followed by the death of Mrs. Donne as well\r\nas the child.\r\n\r\nSome verses are pointed out by Isaac Walton as those written by Donne on\r\nparting from her for this journey. But there is internal evidence in them\r\nto the contrary; for they refer to Italy, not to Paris, and to a lady who\r\nwould accompany him as a page, which a lady in Mrs. Donne’s condition\r\ncould scarcely have done. I have myself no doubt that the verses cited\r\nwere written to his wife long before, when their marriage was as yet\r\nconcealed. With what a fine vigour the poem commences!--\r\n\r\n  “By our first strange and fatal interview,\r\n  By all desires which thereof did ensue,\r\n  By our long-striving hopes, by that remorse\r\n  Which my words’ masculine persuasive force\r\n  Begot in thee, and by the memory\r\n  Of hurts which spies and rivals threaten me!”\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd how full of true feeling and passionate tenderness is the dramatic\r\nclose!--\r\n\r\n  “When I am gone dream me some happiness,\r\n  Nor let thy looks our long-hid love confess;\r\n  Nor praise nor dispraise me; nor bless nor curse\r\n  Openly love’s force; nor in bed fright thy nurse\r\n  With midnight startings, crying out, ‘Oh! oh!\r\n  Nurse! oh, my love is slain! I saw him go\r\n  O’er the white Alps alone; I saw him, I,\r\n  Assailed, taken, fight, stabbed, bleed, and die.’”\r\n\r\nThe verses really written on Donne’s leaving for Paris begin with four\r\nexquisite lines--\r\n\r\n  “As virtuous men pass mild away,\r\n    And whisper to their souls to go,\r\n  Whilst some of their sad friends do say,\r\n    ‘The breath goes now,’ and some say ‘No!’”\r\n\r\nA later verse contains a strange conceit, beaten out into pin-wire a page\r\nlong by a modern poet--[530]\r\n\r\n  “If we be two, we are two so\r\n  As stiff twin compasses are two;\r\n  Thy soul, the fix’d foot, makes no show\r\n  To move, but does if t’other do.”\r\n\r\nDonne was the chief of what Dr. Johnson unwisely called “the metaphysical\r\nschool of poetry.” Dryden accuses Donne of perplexing the fair sex with\r\nnice speculations.[531] His poems, often pious and beautiful, are\r\nsometimes distorted with strange conceits. He has a poem on a flea; and in\r\nhis lines on Good Friday he thus whimsically expresses himself:--\r\n\r\n  “Who sees God’s face--that is, self-life--must die:\r\n  What a death were it then to see God die!\r\n  It made his own lieutenant, Nature, shrink;\r\n  It made his footstool crack and the sun wink.\r\n  Could I behold those hands, which span the Poles,\r\n  And tune all sphears at once, pierced with those holes!”[532]\r\n\r\nThis imitator of the worst faults of Marini was made Dean of St. Paul’s by\r\nKing James I., who delighted to converse with him. The king used to say,\r\n“I always rejoice when I think that by my means Donne became a divine.” He\r\ngave the poet the deanery one day as he sat at dinner, saying “that he\r\nwould carve to him of a dish he loved well, and that he might take the\r\ndish (the deanery) home to his study and say grace there to himself, and\r\nmuch good might it do him.”\r\n\r\nShortly before his death Donne dressed himself in his shroud, and standing\r\nthere, with his eyes shut and the sheet opened, “To discover his thin,\r\npale, and death-like face,” he caused a curious painter to take his\r\npicture. This picture he kept near his bed as a ghostly remembrance, and\r\nfrom this Nicholas Stone, the sculptor, carved his effigy, which still\r\nexists in St. Paul’s, having survived the Great Fire, though the rest of\r\nhis tomb and monument has perished.\r\n\r\nDrury House took the name of Craven House when rebuilt by Lord Craven.\r\nThere is a tradition in Yorkshire, where the deanery of Craven is\r\nsituated, that this chivalrous nobleman’s father was sent up to London by\r\nthe carrier, and there became a mercer or draper. His son was not unworthy\r\nof the staunch old Yorkshire stock. He fought under Gustavus Adolphus\r\nagainst Wallenstein and Tilly, and afterwards attached himself to the\r\nservice of the unfortunate King and Queen of Bohemia, and won wealth and a\r\ntitle for his family, which the Wars of the Roses had first reduced to\r\nindigence.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Bohemia had been married in 1613 to Frederic, Count Palatine\r\nof the Rhine, only a few months after the death of Prince Henry her\r\nbrother. The young King of Spain had been her suitor, and the Pope had\r\nopposed her match with a Protestant. She was married on St. Valentine’s\r\nDay; and Donne, from his study in Drury Lane, celebrated the occasion by a\r\nmost extravagant epithalamion in which is to be found this outrageous\r\nline--\r\n\r\n  “Here lies a She sun, and a He moon there.”\r\n\r\nThe poem opens prettily enough with these lines--\r\n\r\n  “Hail, Bishop Valentine, whose day this is!\r\n  All the air is thy diocese;\r\n  And all the chirping choristers\r\n  And other birds are thy parishioners.\r\n    Thou marry’st every year\r\n  The lyrique lark and the grave whispering dove.”\r\n\r\nAt seventeen Sir William Craven had entered the service of the Prince of\r\nOrange. On the accession of Charles I. he was ennobled. At the storming of\r\nCreuzenach he was the first of the English Cavaliers to mount the breach\r\nand plant the flag. It was then that Gustavus said smilingly to him, “I\r\nperceive, sir, you are willing to give a younger brother a chance of\r\ncoming to your title and estate.” At Donauwert the young Englishman again\r\ndistinguished himself. In the same month that Gustavus fell at Lutzen, the\r\nElector Palatine died at Mentz. While Grotius interceded for the Queen of\r\nBohemia, Lord Craven fought for her in the vineyards of the\r\nPalatinate.[533] In consequence, perhaps, of Richelieu’s intrigues, four\r\nyears elapsed before Charles I. took compassion on the children of his\r\nwidowed sister, whose cause the Puritans had loudly advocated. When\r\nCharles and Rupert did go to England, they went under the care of the\r\ntrusty Lord Craven, who was to try to recover the arrears of the widow’s\r\npension. On their return to Germany, to campaign in Westphalia, Rupert and\r\nLord Craven were taken prisoners and thrown into the castle at Vienna--a\r\nconfinement that lasted three years, a long time for brave young soldiers\r\nwho, like the Douglas, “preferred the lark’s song to the mouse’s squeak.”\r\n\r\nLater in the Civil War we find this same generous nobleman giving £50,000\r\nto King Charles, at a time when he was a beggar and a fugitive. Cromwell,\r\nenraged at the aid thus ministered to an enemy, accused the Cavalier of\r\nenlisting volunteers for the Stuart, and instantly, with stern\r\npromptitude, sequestered all his English estates except Combe Abbey. In\r\nthe meantime Lord Craven served the State and his queen bravely, and\r\nwaited for better times. It was this faithful servant who consoled the\r\nroyal widow for her son’s ill-treatment, the slander heaped upon her\r\ndaughter, and the incessant vexations of importunate creditors.\r\n\r\nThe Restoration brought no good news for the unfortunate queen. Charles,\r\nafraid of her claims for a pension, delayed her return to England, till\r\nthe Earl of Craven generously offered her a house next his own in Drury\r\nLane. She found there a pleasant and commodious mansion, surrounded by a\r\ndelightful garden.[534] It does not appear that she went publicly to\r\ncourt, or joined in the royal revelries; but she visited the theatres with\r\nher nephew Charles and her good old friend and host, and she was reunited\r\nto her son Rupert.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1661, the year after the Restoration, she removed to\r\nLeicester House, then the property of Sir Robert Sydney, Earl of\r\nLeicester, and in the next February she died.[535] Evelyn mentions a\r\nviolent tempestuous wind that followed her death, as a sign from Heaven to\r\nshow that the troubles and calamities of this princess and of the royal\r\nfamily in general had now all blown over, and were, like the ex-queen, to\r\nrest in repose.\r\n\r\nShe left all her books, pictures, and papers to her incomparable old\r\nfriend and benefactor. The Earl of Leicester wrote to the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland a cold and flippant letter to announce the departure of\r\n“his royal tenant;” and adds, “It seems the Fates did not think it fit I\r\nshould have the honour, which indeed I never much desired, to be the\r\nlandlord of a queen.” Charles, who had grudged the dethroned queen even\r\nher subsistence, gave her a royal funeral in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nAt the very time when she died Lord Craven was building a miniature\r\nHeidelberg for her at Hampstead Marshall, in Berkshire, under the advice\r\nof that eminent architect and charlatan, Sir Balthasar Gerbier. But the\r\npalace was ill-fated, like the poor queen, for it was consumed by an\r\naccidental fire before it could be tenanted. The arrival of the Portuguese\r\nInfanta, a princess scarcely less unfortunate than the queen just dead,\r\nsoon erased all recollections of King James’s ill-starred daughter.\r\n\r\nThe biographers of the Queen of Bohemia do not claim for her beauty, wit,\r\nlearning, or accomplishments; but she seems to have been an affectionate,\r\nromantic girl, full of vivacity and ambition, who was ripened by sorrow\r\nand disappointment into an amiable and high-souled woman.\r\n\r\nIt was always supposed that the Queen of Bohemia was secretly married to\r\nLord Craven, as Bassompierre was to a princess of Lorraine. A base and\r\nabandoned court could not otherwise account for a friendship so\r\nunchangeable and so unselfish. There is also a story that when Craven\r\nHouse was pulled down, a subterranean passage was discovered joining the\r\neastern and western sides. Similar passages have been found joining\r\nconvents to monasteries; but, unfortunately for the scandalmongers, they\r\nare generally proved to have been either sewers or conduits. The “Queen of\r\nHearts,” as she was called--the princess to whose cause the chivalrous\r\nChristian of Brunswick, the knight with the silver arm, had solemnly\r\ndevoted his life and fortunes--the “royal mistress” to whom shifty Sir\r\nHenry Wotton had written those beautiful lines--\r\n\r\n  “You meaner beauties of the night,\r\n  That poorly entertain our eyes\r\n  More by your number than your light,\r\n  What are ye when the moon doth rise?”\r\n\r\nwas at “last gone to dust.” Her faithful servant, the old soldier of\r\nGustavus, survived her thirty-five years, and lived to follow to the grave\r\nhis foster-child in arms, Prince Rupert, whose daughter Ruperta was left\r\nto his trusty guardianship.\r\n\r\nIn 1670, on the death of the stolid and drunken Duke of Albemarle, Charles\r\nII. constituted Lord Craven colonel of the Coldstreams. Energetic,\r\nsimple-hearted, benevolent, this good servant of a bad race became a\r\nmember of the Royal Society, lived in familiar intimacy with Evelyn and\r\nRay, improved his property, and employed himself in gardening.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had many estates, Lord Craven always showed the most\r\npredilection for Combe Abbey, the residence of the Queen of Bohemia in her\r\nyouth. To judge by the numerous dedications to which his name is prefixed,\r\nhe would appear to have been a munificent patron of letters, especially\r\nof those authors who had been favourites of Elizabeth of Bohemia.[536]\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James, Lord Craven, true as ever, was sworn of the\r\nPrivy Council; but soon after, on some mean suspicion of the king, was\r\nthreatened with the loss of his regiment. “If they take away my regiment,”\r\nsaid the staunch old soldier, “they had as good take away my life, since I\r\nhave nothing else to divert myself with.” In the hurry of the Popish\r\ncatastrophe it was not taken away. But King William proved Craven’s\r\nloyalty to the Stuarts by giving his regiment to General Talmash.\r\n\r\nThe unemployed officer now expended his activity in attending riots and\r\nfires. Long before, when the Puritan prentices had pulled down the houses\r\nof ill-fame in Whettone Park and in Moorfields, Pepys had described the\r\ncolonel as riding up and down like a madman, giving orders to his men.\r\nLater Lord Dorset had spoken of the old soldier’s energy in a gay ballad\r\non his mistress--\r\n\r\n  “The people’s hearts leap wherever she comes,\r\n  And beat day and night like my Lord Craven’s drums.”\r\n\r\nIn King William’s reign the veteran was so prompt in attending fires that\r\nit used to be said his horse smelt a fire as soon as it broke out.\r\n\r\nLord Craven died unmarried in 1697, aged 88, and was buried at Binley,\r\nnear Coventry. The grandson of a Wharfdale peasant had ended a well-spent\r\nlife. His biographer, Miss Benger, well remarks:--“If his claims to\r\ndisinterestedness be contemned of men, let his cause be (left) to female\r\njudges,--to whose honour be it averred, examples of nobleness, generosity\r\nand magnanimity are ever delightful, because to their purer and more\r\nsusceptible souls they are (never) incredible.”[537]\r\n\r\nDrury House was rebuilt by Lord Craven after the Queen’s death. It\r\noccupied the site of Craven Buildings and the Olympic Theatre. Pennant,\r\never curious and energetic, went to find it, and describes it in his\r\npleasant way as a “large brick pile,” then turned into a public-house\r\nbearing the sign of the Queen of Bohemia, faithful still to the worship of\r\nits old master.\r\n\r\nThe house was taken down in 1809, when the Olympic Pavilion was built on\r\npart of its gardens. The cellars, once stored with good Rhenish from the\r\nPalatinate, and sack from Cadiz, still exist, but have been blocked up.\r\nPalsgrave Place, near Temple Bar, perpetuates the memory of the unlucky\r\nhusband of the brave princess.\r\n\r\nIt was Lord Craven who generously founded pest-houses in Carnaby Street,\r\nsoon after the Great Plague. There were thirty-six small houses and a\r\ncemetery. They were sold in 1772 to William, third Earl of Craven, for\r\n£1200. It may be remembered that in the _Memoirs of Scriblerus_ a room is\r\nhired for the dissection of the purchased body of a malefactor, near the\r\nSt. Giles’s pest-fields, and not far from Tyburn Road, Oxford Street. The\r\nEarl was their founder.\r\n\r\nOn the end wall at the bottom of Craven Buildings there was formerly a\r\nlarge fresco-painting of the Earl of Craven, who was represented in\r\narmour, mounted on a charger, and with a truncheon in his hand. This\r\nportrait had been twice or thrice repainted in oil, but in Brayley’s time\r\nwas entirely obliterated.[538] This fresco is said to have been the work\r\nof Paul Vansomer, a painter who came to England from Antwerp about 1606,\r\nand died in 1621. He painted the Earl and Countess of Arundel, and there\r\nare pictures by him at Hampton Court. He also executed the pleasant and\r\nquaint hunting scene, with portraits of Prince Henry and the young Earl of\r\nEssex, now at St. James’s Palace.[539]\r\n\r\nMr. Moser, keeper of the Royal Academy, a chaser of plate, cane-heads, and\r\nwatch-cases, afterwards an enameller of watch-trinkets, necklaces, and\r\nbracelets, lived in Craven Buildings, which were built in 1723 on part of\r\nthe site of Craven House. He died in his apartments in Somerset House in\r\n1783.\r\n\r\nIt was in Short’s Gardens, Drury Lane, “in a hole,” that Charles Mathews\r\nthe elder made one of his first attempts as an actor.\r\n\r\nClare House Court, on the left hand going up Drury Lane, derived its name\r\nfrom John Holles, second Earl of Clare, whose town house stood at the end\r\nof this court. His son Gilbert, the third Earl, died in 1689, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son, John Holles, created Marquis of Clare and Duke of\r\nNewcastle in 1694. He died in 1711, when all his honours became extinct.\r\nThe corner house has upon it the date 1693.[540]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of James I., when Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, lived at\r\nEly House, in Holborn, he used to pass through Drury Lane in his litter on\r\nhis way to Whitehall, Covent Garden being then an enclosed field, and this\r\ndistrict and the Strand the chief resorts of the gentry. The ladies,\r\nknowing his hours, would appear in their balconies or windows to present\r\ntheir civilities to the old man, who would bend himself as well as he\r\ncould to the humblest posture of respect. One day, as he passed by the\r\nhouse of Lady Jacob in Drury Lane, she presented herself: he bowed to her,\r\nbut she only gaped at him. Curious to see if this yawning was intentional\r\nor accidental, he passed the next day at the same hour, and with the same\r\nresult. Upon which he sent a gentleman to her to let her know that the\r\nladies of England were usually more gracious to him than to encounter his\r\nrespects with such affronts. She answered that she had a mouth to be\r\nstopped as well as others. Gondomar, finding the cause of her distemper,\r\nsent her a present, an antidote which soon cured her of her strange\r\ncomplaint.[541] This Lady Jacob became the wife of the poet Brooke.\r\n\r\nThat credulous gossip, the Wiltshire gentleman, Aubrey, tells a quaint\r\nstory of a duel in Drury Lane, in probably Charles II.’s time, which is a\r\ngood picture of such rencontres amongst the hot-blooded bravos of that\r\nwild period.\r\n\r\n“Captain Carlo Fantom, a Croatian,” he says, “who spoke thirteen\r\nlanguages, was a captain under the Earl of Essex. He had a world of cuts\r\nabout his body with swords, and was very quarrelsome. He met, coming late\r\nat night out of the Horseshoe Tavern in Drury Lane, with a lieutenant of\r\nColonel Rossiter, who had great jingling spurs on. Said he, ‘The noise of\r\nyour spurs doe offend me; you must come over the kennel and give me\r\nsatisfaction.’ They drew and passed at each other, and the lieutenant was\r\nrunne through, and died in an hour or two, and ’twas not known who killed\r\nhim.”[542]\r\n\r\nAbout this time John Lacy, Charles II.’s favourite comedian, the Falstaff\r\nof Dryden’s time, lived in Drury Lane from 1665 till his death in 1681.\r\nThe ex-dancing-master and lieutenant dwelt near Cradle Alley and only two\r\ndoors from Lord Anglesey.\r\n\r\nDrury Lane, though it soon began to deteriorate, had fashionable\r\ninhabitants in Charles II.’s time. Evelyn, that delightful type of the\r\nEnglish gentleman, mentions in his _Diary_ the marriage of his niece to\r\nthe eldest son of Mr. Attorney Montague at Southampton Chapel, and talks\r\nof a magnificent entertainment at his sister’s “lodgings” in Drury Lane.\r\nSteele, however, branded its disreputable districts; Gay[543] warned us\r\nagainst “Drury’s mazy courts and dark abodes;” and Pope laughed at\r\nbuilding a church for “the saints of Drury Lane,” and derided its proud\r\nand paltry “drabs.” The little sour poet, snugly off and well housed,\r\ndelighted to sneer, with a cruel and ungenerous contempt, at the poverty\r\nof the poor Drury Lane poet who wrote for instant bread:--\r\n\r\n  “‘Nine years!’ cries he, who, high in Drury Lane,\r\n  Lull’d by soft zephyrs through the broken pane,\r\n  Rhymes ere he wakes, and prints before Term ends,\r\n  Obliged by hunger and request of friends.”\r\n\r\nTo ridicule poverty, and to treat misfortune as a punishable crime, is the\r\nspecial opprobrium of too many of the heroes of English literature.\r\n\r\nHogarth has shown us the poor poet of Drury Lane; Goldsmith has painted\r\nfor us the poor author, but in a kindlier way, for he must have\r\nremembered how poor he himself and Dr. Johnson, Savage, Otway, and Lee had\r\nbeen. Pope, in his notes to the _Dunciad_, expressly says that the poverty\r\nof his enemies is the cause of all their slander. Poverty with him is\r\nanother name for vice and all uncleanness. Goldsmith only laughs as he\r\ndescribes the poor poet in Drury Lane in a garret, snug from the Bailiff,\r\nand opposite a public-house famous for Calvert’s beer and Parsons’s “black\r\nchampagne.” The windows are dim and patched; the floor is sanded. The damp\r\nwalls are hung with the royal game of goose, the twelve rules of King\r\nCharles, and a black profile of the Duke of Cumberland. The rusty grate\r\nhas no fire. The mantelpiece is chalked with long unpaid scores of beer\r\nand milk. There are five cracked teacups on the chimney-board; and the\r\npoet meditates over his epics and his finances with a stocking round his\r\nbrows “instead of bay.”\r\n\r\nEarly in the reign of William III. Drury Lane finally lost all traces of\r\nits aristocratic character.\r\n\r\nVinegar Yard, in Drury Lane, was originally called Vine Garden Yard. Vine\r\nStreet, Piccadilly, Vine Street, Westminster, and Vine Street, Saffron\r\nHill, all derived their names from the vineyards they displaced; but there\r\nis great reason to suppose that in the Middle Ages orchards and\r\nherb-gardens were often classified carelessly as “vineyards.” English\r\ngrapes might produce a sour, thin wine, but there was never a time when\r\nhome-made wine superseded the produce of Montvoisin, Bordeaux, or Gascony.\r\nVinegar Yard was built about 1621.[544] In St Martin’s Burial Register\r\nthere is an entry, “1624, Feb. 4: Buried Blind John out of Vinagre Yard.”\r\nClayrender’s letter in Smollett’s _Roderick Random_ is written to her\r\n“dear kreetur” from “Winegar Yard, Droory Lane.” This fair charmer must\r\nsurely have lived not far from Mr. Dickens’s inimitable Mrs. Megby. The\r\nnearness of Vinegar Yard to the theatre is alluded to by James Smith in\r\nhis parody on Sir Walter Scott in the _Rejected Addresses_.\r\n\r\nGeneral Monk’s gross and violent wife was the daughter of his servant,\r\nJohn Clarges, a farrier in the Savoy. Her mother, says Aubrey, was one of\r\nthe five women-barbers[545] that lived in Drury Lane. She kept a\r\nglove-shop in the New Exchange before her marriage, and as a seamstress\r\nused to carry the general’s linen to him when he was in the Tower.\r\n\r\nPepys hated her, because she was jealous of his patron, Lord Sandwich, and\r\ncalled him a coward. He calls her “ill-looking” and “a plain, homely\r\ndowdy,” and says that one day, when Monk was drunk, and sitting with\r\nTroutbeck, a disreputable fellow, the duke was wondering that Nan Hyde, a\r\nbrewer’s daughter, should ever have come to be Duchess of York. “Nay,”\r\nsaid Troutbeck, “ne’er wonder at that, for if you will give me another\r\nbottle of wine I will tell you as great if not a greater miracle, and that\r\nwas that our Dirty Bess should come to be Duchess of Albemarle.”[546]\r\n\r\nNell Gwynn was born in Coal Yard, on the east side of Drury Lane,[547] the\r\nnext turning to the infamous Lewknor Lane, which used to be inhabited by\r\nthe orange-girls who attended the theatres in Charles II.’s reign. It was\r\nin this same lane that Jonathan Wild, the thief-taker, whom Fielding\r\nimmortalises, afterwards lived. In a coarse and ruthless satire written by\r\nSir George Etherege after Nell’s death, the poet calls her a “scoundrel\r\nlass,” raised from a dunghill, born in a cellar, and brought up as a\r\ncinder-wench in a coalyard.[548]\r\n\r\nNelly was the vagabond daughter of a poor Cavalier captain and fruiterer,\r\nwho is said to have died in prison at Oxford. She began life by selling\r\nfish in the street, then turned orange-girl at the theatres, was promoted\r\nto be an actress, and finally became a mistress of Charles II. Though not\r\nas savage-tempered as the infamous Lady Castlemaine, Nelly was almost as\r\nmischievous, and quite as shameless. She obtained from the king £60,000\r\nin four years.[549] She bought a pearl necklace at Prince Rupert’s sale\r\nfor £4000. She drank, swore, gambled, and squandered money as wildly as\r\nher rivals. Nelly was small, with a good-humoured face, and “eyes that\r\nwinked when she laughed.”[550] She was witty, reckless, and good-natured.\r\nThe portrait of her by Lely, with the lamb under her arm, shows us a very\r\narch, pretty, dimply little actress. The present Duke of St. Alban’s is\r\ndescended from her.[551]\r\n\r\nIn 1667 Nell Gwynn was living in Drury Lane, for on May day of that year\r\nPepys says--“To Westminster, in the way meeting many milkmaids with\r\ngarlands upon their pails, dancing with a fiddler between them; and saw\r\npretty Nelly standing at her lodging’s door in Drury Lane, in her\r\nsmock-sleeves and boddice, looking upon one. She seemed a mighty pretty\r\ncreature.” Nelly had not then been long on the stage, and Pepys had hissed\r\nher a few months before being introduced to her by dangerous Mrs. Knipp.\r\nIn 1671 Evelyn saw Nelly, then living in Pall Mall, “looking out of her\r\ngarden on a terrace at the top of the wall,” and talking too familiarly to\r\nthe king, who stood on the green walk in the park below.[552]\r\n\r\nPoor Nell was not “allowed to starve,” but ended an ill life by dying of\r\napoplexy. There is no authority for the name of “Nell Gwynn’s Dairy” given\r\nto a house near the Adelphi.\r\n\r\nThat infamous and perjured scoundrel, and the murderer of so many innocent\r\nmen, Titus Oates, was the son of a popular Baptist preacher in Ratcliffe\r\nHighway, and was educated at Merchant Taylor’s. Dismissed from the Fleet,\r\nof which he was chaplain, for infamous practices, he became a Jesuit at\r\nSt. Omer’s, and came back to disclose the sham Popish plot, for which\r\natrocious lie he received of the Roman Catholic king, Charles II., £1200 a\r\nyear, an escort of guards, and a lodging in Whitehall. Oates died in\r\n1705. He lodged for some time in Cockpit Alley, now called Pitt Place.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Crown Tavern, next the Whistling Oyster, and close to the\r\nsouth side of Drury Lane Theatre, that _Punch_ was first projected by Mr.\r\nMark Lemon and Mr. Henry Mayhew in 1841; and its first number was\r\n“prepared for press” in a back room in Newcastle Street, Strand. Great\r\nrivers often have their sources in swampy and obscure places, and our\r\ngood-natured satirist has not much to boast of in its birthplace. To\r\n_Punch_ Tom Hood contributed his immortal “Song of the Shirt,” and\r\nTennyson his scorching satire against Bulwer and his “New Timon;” almost\r\nfrom the first, Leech devoted to it his humorous pencil, and Albert Smith\r\nhis perennial store of good humour and drollery. Amongst its other early\r\ncontributors should be mentioned Mr. Gilbert A. à Beckett, Mr. W. H.\r\nWills, and Douglas Jerrold.\r\n\r\nZoffany, the artist, lived for some time in poverty in Drury Lane. Mr.\r\nAudinet, father of Philip Audinet the engraver, served his time with the\r\ncelebrated clockmaker, Rimbault, who lived in Great St. Andrew’s Street,\r\nSeven Dials. This worthy excelled in the construction of the clocks called\r\nat that time “Twelve-tuned Dutchmen,” which were contrived with moving\r\nfigures, engaged in a variety of employments. The pricking of the barrels\r\nof those clocks was performed by Bellodi, an Italian, who lived hard by,\r\nin Short’s Gardens, Drury Lane. This person solicited Rimbault in favour\r\nof a starving artist who dwelt in a garret in his house. “Let him come to\r\nme,” said Rimbault. Accordingly Zoffany waited upon the clockmaker, and\r\nproduced some specimens of his art, which were so satisfactory that he was\r\nimmediately set to work to embellish clock-faces, and paint appropriate\r\nbackgrounds to the puppets upon them. From clock-faces the young painter\r\nproceeded to the human face divine, and at last resolved to try his hand\r\nupon the visage of the worthy clockmaker himself. He hit off the likeness\r\nof the patron so successfully, that Rimbault exerted himself to serve and\r\npromote him. Benjamin Wilson, the portrait-painter, who at that time lived\r\nat 56 Great Russell Street, a house afterwards inhabited by Philip\r\nAudinet, being desirous of procuring an assistant who could draw the\r\nfigure well, and being, like Lawrence, deficient in all but the head,\r\nfound out the ingenious painter of clock-faces, and engaged him at the\r\nmoderate salary of forty pounds a year, with an especial injunction to\r\nsecrecy. In this capacity he worked upon a picture of Garrick and Miss\r\nBellamy in “Romeo and Juliet,” which was exhibited under the name of\r\nWilson. Garrick’s keen eye satisfied him that another hand was in the\r\nwork; so he resolved to discover the unknown painter. This discovery he\r\neffected by perseverance: he made the acquaintance of Zoffany and became\r\nhis patron, employing him himself and introducing him to his friends; and\r\nin this way his bias to theatrical portraiture became established.\r\nGarrick’s favour met with an ample return in the admirable portraits of\r\nhimself and contemporaries, which have rendered their personal appearance\r\nso speakingly familiar to posterity both in his pictures and the admirable\r\nmezzotinto scrapings of Earlom. Zoffany was elected among the first\r\nmembers of the Royal Academy in 1768.\r\n\r\nThe old Cockpit, or Phœnix Theatre, stood on the site of what is now\r\ncalled Pitt Place. Early in James I.’s reign it had been turned into a\r\nplayhouse, and probably rebuilt.[553]\r\n\r\nOn Shrove Tuesday 1616-17 the London prentices, roused to their annual\r\nzeal by a love of mischief and probably a Puritan fervour, sacked the\r\nbuilding, to the discomfiture of the harmless players. Bitter,\r\nnarrow-headed Prynne, who notes with horror and anger the forty thousand\r\nplays printed in two years for the five Devil’s chapels in London,[554]\r\ndescribes the Cockpit as demoralising Drury Lane, then no doubt wealthy,\r\nand therefore supposed to be respectable. In 1647 the Cockpit Theatre was\r\nturned into a schoolroom; in 1649 Puritan soldiers broke into the house,\r\nwhich had again become a theatre, captured the actors, dispersed the\r\naudience, broke up the seats and stage, and carried off the dramatic\r\ncriminals in open day, in all their stage finery, to the Gate House at\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nRhodes, the old prompter at Blackfriars, who had turned bookseller,\r\nreopened the Cockpit on the Restoration. The new Theatre in Drury Lane\r\nopened in 1663 with the “Humorous Lieutenant” of Beaumont and Fletcher.\r\nThis was the King’s Company under Killigrew. Davenant and the Duke of\r\nYork’s company found a home first in the Cockpit, and afterwards in\r\nSalisbury Court, Fleet Street.\r\n\r\nThe first Drury Lane Theatre was burnt down in 1672. Wren built the new\r\nhouse, which opened in 1674 with a prologue by Dryden. Cibber gives a\r\ncareful account of Wren’s Drury Lane, the chief entrance to which was down\r\nPlayhouse Passage. Pepys blamed it for the distance of the stage from the\r\nboxes, and for the narrowness of the pit entrances.[555] The platform of\r\nthe stage projected very forward, and the lower doors of entrance for the\r\nactors were in the place of the stage-boxes.[556]\r\n\r\nIn 1681 the two companies united, leaving Portugal Street to the lithe\r\ntennis-players and Dorset Gardens to the brawny wrestlers. Wren’s theatre\r\nwas taken down in 1791; its successor, built by Holland, was opened in\r\n1794, and destroyed in 1809. The present edifice, the fourth in\r\nsuccession, is the work of Wyatt, and was opened in 1812.[557]\r\n\r\nHart, Mohun, Burt, and Clun were all actors in Killigrew’s company. Hart,\r\nwho had been a captain in the army, was dignified as Alexander,\r\nincomparable as Catiline, and excellent as Othello. He died in 1683.\r\nMohun, whom Nat Lee wrote parts for, and who had been a major in the Civil\r\nWar, was much applauded in heroic parts, and was a favourite of\r\nRochester’s. Burt played Cicero in Ben Jonson’s “Catiline;” and poor Clun,\r\nwho was murdered by footpads in Kentish Town, was great as Iago, and as\r\nSubtle in “The Alchymist.”\r\n\r\nFrom Pepys’s memoranda of visits to Drury Lane we gather a few facts about\r\nthe licentious theatre-goers of his day. After the Plague, when Drury Lane\r\nhad been deserted, the old gossip went there, half-ashamed to be seen, and\r\nwith his cloak thrown up round his face.[558] The king flaunts about with\r\nhis mistresses, and Pepys goes into an upper box to chat with the\r\nactresses and see a rehearsal, which seems then to have followed and not\r\npreceded the daily performance.[559] He describes Sir Charles Sedley, in\r\nthe pit, exchanging banter with a lady in a mask. Three o’clock seems to\r\nhave been about the time for theatres opening.[560] The king was angry, he\r\nsays, with Ned Howard for writing a play called “The Change of Crowns,” in\r\nwhich Lacy acted a country gentleman who is astonished at the corruption\r\nof the court. For this Lacy was committed to the porter’s lodge; on being\r\nreleased, he called the author a fool, and having a glove thrown in his\r\nface, returned the compliment with a blow on Howard’s pate with a cane;\r\nupon which the pit wondered that Howard did not run the mean fellow\r\nthrough; and the king closed the house, which the gentry thought had grown\r\ntoo insolent.\r\n\r\nAugust 15, 1667, Pepys goes to see the “Merry Wives of Windsor,” which\r\npleased our great Admiralty official “in no part of it.” Two days after he\r\nweeps at the troubles of Queen Elizabeth, but revives when that dangerous\r\nMrs. Knipp dances among the milkmaids, and comes out in her nightgown to\r\nsing a song. Another day he goes at three o’clock to see Beaumont and\r\nFletcher’s “Scornful Lady,” but does not remain, as there is no one in the\r\npit. In September of the same year he finds his wife and servant in an\r\neighteenpenny seat. In October 1667 he ventures into the tiring-room where\r\nNell was dressing, and then had fruit in the scene-room, and heard Mrs.\r\nKnipp read her part in “Flora’s Vagaries,” Nell cursing because there were\r\nso few people in the pit. A fortnight after he contrives to see a new\r\nplay, “The Black Prince,” by Lord Orrery; and though he goes at two, finds\r\nno room in the pit, and has for the first time in his life to take an\r\nupper four-shilling-box. November 1, he proclaims the “Taming of the\r\nShrew” “a silly old play.” November 2, the house was full of Parliament\r\nmen, the House being up. One of them choking himself while eating some\r\nfruit, Orange Moll thrust her finger down his throat and brought him to\r\nlife again.\r\n\r\nPepys condemns Nell Gwynn as unbearable in serious parts, but considers\r\nher beyond imitation as a madwoman. In December 1667 he describes a poor\r\nwoman who had lent her child to the actors, but hearing him cry, forced\r\nher way on to the stage and bore it off from Hart.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from subsequent notes in the _Diary_, that to a man who\r\nstopped only for one act at a theatre, and took no seat, no charge was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIn February 1668 Pepys sees at Drury Lane “The Virgin Martyr,” by\r\nMassinger, which he pronounces not to be worth much but for Becky\r\nMarshall’s acting; yet the wind music when the angel descended “wrapped\r\nup” his soul so, that, remarkably enough, it made him as sick as when he\r\nwas first in love, and he determined to go home and make his wife learn\r\nwind music. May 1, 1668, he mentions that the pit was thrown into disorder\r\nby the rain coming in at the cupola. May 7 of the same year, he calls for\r\nKnipp when the play is over, and sees “Nell in her boy’s clothes, mighty\r\npretty.” “But, Lord!” he says, “their confidence! and how many men do\r\nhover about them as soon as they come off the stage! and how confident\r\nthey are in their talk!”\r\n\r\nOn May 18, 1668, Pepys goes as early as twelve o’clock to see the first\r\nperformance of that poor play, Sir Charles Sedley’s “Mulberry Garden,” at\r\nwhich the king, queen, and court did not laugh. While waiting for the\r\ncurtain to pull up, Pepys hires a boy to keep his place, slips out to the\r\nRose Tavern in Russell Street, and dines off a breast of mutton from the\r\nspit.\r\n\r\nOn September 15, 1668, there is a play--“The Ladies à la Mode”--so bad\r\nthat the actor who announced the piece to be repeated fell a-laughing, as\r\ndid the pit. Four days after Pepys sits next Shadwell, the poet,\r\nadmiring Ben Jonson’s extravagant comedy, “The Silent Woman.”\r\n\r\nIn January 1669 he sat in a box near “that merry jade Nell,” who, with a\r\ncomrade from the Duke’s House, “lay there laughing upon people.”\r\n\r\n“Les Horaces” of Corneille he found “a silly tragedy.” February 1669\r\nBeetson, one of the actors, read his part, Kynaston having been beaten and\r\ndisabled by order of Sir Charles Sedley, whom he had ridiculed. The same\r\nmonth Pepys went to the King’s House to see “The Faithful Shepherdess,”\r\nand found not more than £10 in the house.\r\n\r\nA great leader in the Drury Lane troop was Lacy, the Falstaff of his day.\r\nHe was a handsome, audacious fellow, who delighted the town as “Frenchman,\r\nScot, or Irishman, fine gentleman or fool, honest simpleton or rogue,\r\nTartuffe or Drench, old man or loquacious woman.” He was King Charles’s\r\nfavourite actor as Teague in “The Committee,” or mimicking Dryden as Bayes\r\nin “The Rehearsal.”\r\n\r\nThe greatest rascal in the company was Goodman--“Scum Goodman,” as he was\r\ncalled--admirable as Alexander and Julius Cæsar. He was a dashing,\r\nshameless, impudent rogue, who used to boast that he had once taken “an\r\nairing” on the road to recruit his purse. He was expelled Cambridge for\r\nslashing a picture of the Duke of Monmouth. He hired an Italian quack to\r\npoison two children of his mistress, the infamous Duchess of Cleveland,\r\njoined in the Fenwick plot to kill King William, and would have turned\r\ntraitor against his fellow conspirators had he not been bought off for\r\n£500 a year, and sent to Paris, where he disappeared.\r\n\r\nHaines, one of Killigrew’s band, was an impudent but clever low comedian.\r\nIn Sparkish, in “The Country Wife,” he was the very model of airy\r\ngentlemen. His great successes were as Captain Bluff in Congreve’s “Old\r\nBachelor,” Roger in “Æsop,” and “the lively, impudent, and irresistible\r\nTom Errand” in Farquhar’s “Constant Couple,” “that most triumphant comedy\r\nof a whole century.”[561]\r\n\r\nThe stories told of Joe Haines are good. He once engaged a simple-minded\r\nclergyman as “chaplain to the Theatre Royal,” and sent him behind the\r\nscenes ringing a big bell to call the actors to prayers. “Count” Haines\r\nwas once arrested by two bailiffs on Holborn Hill at the very moment that\r\nthe Bishop of Ely passed in his carriage. “Here comes my cousin, he will\r\nsatisfy you,” said the ready-witted actor, who instantly stepped to the\r\ncarriage window and whispered Bishop Patrick--“Here are two Romanists, my\r\nlord, inclined to become Protestants, but yet with some scruples of\r\nconscience.” The anxious bishop instantly beckoned to the bailiffs to\r\nfollow him to Ely Place, and Joe escaped; the mortified bishop paying the\r\nmoney out of sheer shame. Haines died in 1701.\r\n\r\nAmongst the actresses at this house were pretty but frail Mrs. Hughes, the\r\nmistress of Prince Rupert, and Mrs. Knipp, Pepys’s dangerous friend, who\r\nacted rakish fine ladies and rattling ladies’-maids, and came on to sing\r\nas priestess, nun, or milkmaid. Anne Marshall, the daughter of a\r\nPresbyterian divine, acquired a reputation as Dorothea in “The Virgin\r\nMartyr,” and as the Queen of Sicily in Dryden’s “Secret Love.”\r\n\r\nBut Nell Gwynn was the chief “toast” of the town. Little, pretty,\r\nimpudent, and witty, she danced well, and was a good actress in comedy and\r\nin characters where “natural emotion bordering on insanity” was to be\r\nrepresented.[562] Her last original part was that of Almahide in Dryden’s\r\n“Conquest of Granada,” where she spoke the prologue in a straw hat as\r\nlarge as a waggon-wheel.\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt says that “Nineteen out of twenty of Dryden’s plays were\r\nproduced at Drury Lane, and seven out of Lee’s eleven; all the good plays\r\nof Wycherly, except ‘The Gentleman Dancing Master;’ two of\r\nCongreve’s--‘The Old Bachelor’ and ‘The Double Dealer;’ and all\r\nFarquhar’s, except ‘The Beau’s Stratagem.’”[563] Dryden’s impurity and\r\ndaring bombast were the attractions to Drury Lane, as Otway’s\r\nsentimentalism and real pathos were to the rival house. Lee’s splendid\r\nbombast was succeeded by Farquhar’s gay rakes and not too virtuous women.\r\n\r\nDoggett, who was before the public from 1691 to 1713, was a little lively\r\nIrishman, for whom Congreve wrote the characters of Fondlewife, Sir Paul\r\nPliant, and Ben. He was partner in the theatre with Cibber and Wilkes from\r\n1709 to 1712, but left when Booth was taken into the firm. He was a\r\nstaunch Whig, and left an orange livery and a badge to be rowed for yearly\r\nby six London watermen.\r\n\r\nThe queen of comedy, Mrs. Oldfield, flashed upon the town first as Lady\r\nBetty Modish in Cibber’s “Careless Husband,” in 1704-5. When quite a girl\r\nshe was overheard by Farquhar reading “The Scornful Lady” of Beaumont and\r\nFletcher to her aunt, who kept the Mitre Tavern in St. James’s Market.\r\nFarquhar introduced her to Vanbrugh, and Vanbrugh to Rich. “She excelled\r\nall actresses,” says Davies, “in sprightliness of wit and elegance of\r\nmanner, and was greatly superior in the clear, sonorous, and harmonious\r\ntones of her voice.” Her eyes were large and speaking, and when intended\r\nto give special archness to some brilliant or gay thought, she kept them\r\nmischievously half shut. Cibber praises Mrs. Oldfield for her unpresuming\r\nmodesty, and her good sense in not rejecting advice--“A mark of good\r\nsense,” says the shrewd old manager, “rarely known in any actor of either\r\nsex but herself. Yet it was a hard matter to give her any hint that she\r\nwas not able to take or improve.”[564] With all this merit, she was\r\ntractable and less presuming in her station than several that had not half\r\nher pretensions to be troublesome. This excellent actress was not fond of\r\ntragedy, but she still played Marcia in “Cato;” Swift, who attended the\r\nrehearsals with Addison, railed at her for her good-humoured carelessness\r\nand indifference; and Pope sneered at her vanity in her last moments. It\r\nis true that she was buried in kid gloves, tucker, and ruffles of best\r\nlace. Mrs. Oldfield lived first with a Mr. Maynwaring, a rough,\r\nhard-drinking Whig writer, to whom Addison dedicated one of the volumes of\r\nthe _Spectator_; and after his death with General Churchill, one of the\r\nMarlborough family. Nevertheless, she went to court and habitually\r\nassociated with ladies of the highest rank. Society is cruel and\r\ninconsistent in these matters. Open scandal it detests, but to secret vice\r\nit is indifferent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oldfield died in 1730, lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and\r\nwhen she was borne to her grave in the Abbey, Lord Hervey (Pope’s\r\n“Sporus”), Lord Delawarr, and that toady Bubb Doddington, supported her\r\npall. The late Earl of Cadogan was the great-grandson of Anne\r\nOldfield.[565] This actress, so majestic in tragedy, so irresistible in\r\ncomedy, was generous enough to give an annuity to poor, hopeless, scampish\r\nSavage.\r\n\r\nRobert Wilkes, a young Irish Government clerk, obtained great successes as\r\nFarquhar’s heroes, Sir Harry Wildair, Mirabel, Captain Plume, and Archer.\r\nHe played equally well the light gentlemen of Cibber’s comedies. Genest\r\ndescribes him as buoyant and graceful on the stage, irreproachable in\r\ndress, his every movement marked by “an ease of breeding and manner.” This\r\nactor also excelled in plaintive and tender parts. Cibber hints, however,\r\nat his professional conceit and overbearing temper. Wilkes on one occasion\r\nread “George Barnwell” to Queen Anne at the Court at St. James’s. He died\r\nin 1732.\r\n\r\nBarton Booth, who was at Westminster School with Rowe the poet, identified\r\nhimself with Addison’s Cato. His dignity, pathos, and energy as that lover\r\nof liberty led Bolingbroke to present him on the first night with a purse\r\nof fifty guineas. The play was translated into four languages; Pope gave\r\nit a prologue; Garth decked it with an epilogue; while Denis proved it, to\r\nhis own satisfaction, to be worthless. Aaron Hill tells us that statistics\r\nproved that Booth could always obtain from eighteen to twenty rounds of\r\napplause during the evening. When playing the Ghost to Betterton’s Hamlet,\r\nBooth is said to have been once so horror-stricken as to be unable to\r\nproceed with his part. He often took inferior Shaksperean parts, and was\r\nfrequently indolent; but if he saw a man whose opinion he valued among the\r\naudience he fired up and played to him. This petted actor and manager died\r\nin 1733.\r\n\r\nColley Cibber, to judge from Steele’s criticisms, must have been admirable\r\nas a beau, whether rallying pleasantly, scorning artfully, ridiculing, or\r\nneglecting.[566] Wilkes surpassed him in beseeching gracefully,\r\napproaching respectfully, pitying, mourning, and loving. In the part of\r\nSir Fopling Flutter in “The Fool of Fashion,” played in 1695, Cibber wore\r\na fair, full-bottomed periwig which was so much admired that it used to be\r\nbrought on the stage in a sedan and put on publicly. To this wonder of the\r\ntown Colonel Brett, who married Savage’s mother, took a special fancy.\r\n“The beaux of those days,” says Cibber, “had more of the stateliness of\r\nthe peacock than the pert of the lapwing.” The colonel came behind the\r\nscenes, first praised the wig, and then offered to purchase it. On\r\nCibber’s bantering him about his anxiety for such a trifle, the gay\r\ncolonel began to rally himself with such humour that he fairly won Cibber,\r\nand they sat down at once, laughing, to finish their bargain over a\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\nQuin’s career began at Dublin in 1714, and ended at Bath in 1753. From\r\n1736 to 1741 he was at Drury Lane. From Booth’s retirement till the coming\r\nof Garrick, Quin had no rival as Cato, Brutus, Volpone, Falstaff, Zanga,\r\netc. His Macbeth, Othello, and Lear were inferior. Davies says, the tender\r\nand the violent were beyond his reach, but he gave words weight and\r\ndignity by his sensible elocution and well-regulated voice. His movements\r\nwere ponderous and his action languid. Quin was generous, witty, a great\r\nepicure, and a careless dresser. It was his hard fate, though a\r\nwarm-hearted man, to be equally warm in temper, and to kill two\r\nadversaries in duels that were forced upon him. Quin was a friend of\r\nGarrick and of Thomson the poet, and a frequent visitor at Allen’s house\r\nat Prior Park, near Bath, where Pope, Warburton, and Fielding visited.\r\n\r\nSome of Quin’s jests were perfect. When Warburton said, “By what law can\r\nthe execution of Charles I. be justified?” Quin replied, “By all the laws\r\nhe had left them.” No wonder Walpole applauded him. The bishop bade the\r\nplayer remember that the regicides came to violent ends, but Quin gave him\r\na worse blow. “That, your lordship,” he said, “if I am not mistaken, was\r\nalso the case with the twelve apostles.” Quin could overthrow even Foote.\r\nThey had at one time had a quarrel, and were reconciled, but Foote was\r\nstill a little sore. “Jemmy,” said he, “you should not have said that I\r\nhad but one shirt, and that I lay in bed while it was washed.” “Sammy,”\r\nreplied the actor, “I never _could_ have said so, for I never knew that\r\nyou had a shirt to wash.” Quin died in 1766, and Garrick wrote an epitaph\r\non his tomb in Bath Abbey, ending with the line--\r\n\r\n  “To this complexion we must come at last.”\r\n\r\nGarrick appeared first at Goodman’s Fields Theatre, in 1741, as King\r\nRichard. In eight days the west flocked eastward, and, as Davies tells us,\r\n“the coaches of the nobility filled up the space from Temple Bar to\r\nWhitechapel.” Pope came up from Twickenham to see if the young man was\r\nequal to Betterton. Garrick revolutionised the stage. Tragedians had\r\nfallen into a pompous “rhythmical, mechanical sing-song,”[567] fit only\r\nfor dull orators. Their style was overlaboured with art--it was mere\r\ndeclamation. The actor had long ceased to imitate nature. Garrick’s first\r\nappearance at Drury Lane was in 1742. Cumberland, then at Westminster\r\nSchool, describes his sight of Quin and Garrick, and the first impressions\r\nthey produced on him. Garrick was Lothario, Mrs. Cibber Calista, Quin\r\nHoratio, and Mrs. Pritchard Lavinia. Quin, when the curtain drew up,\r\npresented himself in a green velvet coat, embroidered down the seams, an\r\nenormous full-bottomed periwig, rolled stockings, and high-heeled square\r\nshoes.[568] “With very little variation of cadence, and in a deep full\r\ntone, accompanied by a sawing kind of action which had more of the senate\r\nthan the stage in it, he rolled out his heroics with an air of dignified\r\nindifference that seemed to disdain the plaudits that were bestowed upon\r\nhim. Mrs. Cibber, in a key high-pitched but sweet withal, sang or rather\r\nrecitatived Rowe’s harmonious strains. But when, after long and anxious\r\nexpectation, I first beheld little Garrick, then young and light and alive\r\nin every muscle and every feature, come bounding on the stage and pointing\r\nat the wittol Altamont and heavy-paced Horatio, heavens! what a\r\ntransition!--it seemed as if a whole century had been swept over in the\r\npassage of a single scene.” And yet, according to fretful Cumberland, “the\r\nshow of hands” was for Quin, though, according to Davies, the best judges\r\nwere for Garrick. And when Quin was slow in answering the challenge,\r\nsomebody in the gallery called out, “Why don’t you tell the gentleman\r\nwhether you will meet him or not?” Garrick’s repertory extended to one\r\nhundred characters, of which he was the original representative of\r\nthirty-six. Of his comic characters, Ranger and Abel Drugger were the\r\nbest--one was irresistibly vivacious, the other comically stupid.\r\n\r\nGarrick, who mutilated Shakespere and wrote clever verses and useful\r\ntheatrical adaptations, was a vain, sprightly man, who got the reputation\r\nof reforming stage costume, although it was Macklin, pugnacious and\r\ncourageous, who first dared to act Macbeth dressed as a Highland chief,\r\nand felt proud of his own anachronism. Garrick had, in fact, a dislike to\r\nreally truthful costume. He dared to play Hotspur in laced frock and\r\nRamillies wig.[569] In truth, it was neither Garrick nor Macklin who\r\noriginated this reform, but the change of public opinion and the widening\r\nof education. West, in spite of ridicule and condemnation, dared to dress\r\nthe soldiers in his “Death of Wolfe” in English uniform, instead of in the\r\narmour of stage Romans. Burke said of Garrick that he was the most acute\r\nobserver of nature he had ever known. Garrick could assume any passion at\r\nthe moment, and could act off-hand Scrub or Richard, Brute or Macbeth. He\r\noscillated between tragedy and comedy; he danced to perfection; he was\r\nlaborious at rehearsals, and yet all that he did seemed spontaneous. In\r\nFribble he imitated no fewer than eleven men of fashion so that every one\r\nrecognised them. Garrick died in 1779, and was buried in _the_ Abbey.\r\n“Chatham,” says Dr. Doran, the actor’s admirable biographer, “had\r\naddressed him living in verse, and peers sought for the honour of\r\nsupporting the pall at his funeral.”[570] That he was vain and\r\nover-sensitive there can be no doubt; but there can be also no doubt that\r\nhe was generous, often charitable, delightful in society, and never, like\r\nFoote, eager to give pain by the exercise of his talent. As an actor,\r\nGarrick has not since been equalled in versatility and equal balance of\r\npower; nor has any subsequent actor attained so high a rank among the\r\nintellect of his age.\r\n\r\nKitty Clive, born in 1711, took leave of the stage in 1769. She was one of\r\nthe best-natured, wittiest, happiest, and most versatile of actresses,\r\nwhether as “roguish chambermaid, fierce virago, chuckling hoyden, brazen\r\nromp, stolid country girl, affected fine lady, or thoroughly natural old\r\nwoman.”[571] Fielding, Garrick, and Walpole delighted in Kitty Clive.\r\nAfter years of quadrille at Purcell’s, and cards and music at the villa at\r\nTeddington which Horace Walpole lent her, Kitty Clive died suddenly,\r\nwithout a groan, in 1785.\r\n\r\nWoodward was excellent in fops, rascals, simpletons, and Shakesperean\r\nlight characters. His Bobadil, Marplot, and Touchstone were beyond\r\napproach. Shuter, originally a billiard-marker, came on the stage in 1744,\r\nand quitted it in 1776. His grimace and impromptu were much praised.\r\n\r\nSamuel Foote, born at Truro in 1720, having failed in tragedy, and not\r\nbeen very successful in comedy, started his entertainments at the\r\nHaymarket in 1747. He died in 1777. His history belongs to the records of\r\nanother theatre.\r\n\r\nSpanger Barry in 1748-9 acted Hamlet and Macbeth alternately with Garrick.\r\nDavies says that Barry could not perform such characters as Richard and\r\nMacbeth, but he made a capital Alexander. “He charmed the ladies by the\r\nsoft melody of his love complaints and the noble ardour of his courtship.”\r\nOnly Mrs. Cibber excelled him in the expression of love, grief,\r\ntenderness, and jealous rage. Tall, handsome, and dignified, Barry\r\nundoubtedly ran Garrick close in the part of Romeo, artificial as\r\nChurchill in the _Rosciad_ declares him to have been. A lady once said,\r\n“that had she been Juliet she should have expected Garrick to have stormed\r\nthe balcony, he was so impassioned; but that Barry was so eloquent,\r\ntender, and seductive, that she should have come down to him.”[572] In\r\nLear, the town said that Barry “was every inch a king” but Garrick “every\r\ninch King Lear.” Barry was amorous and extravagant. He delighted in giving\r\nmagnificent entertainments, and treated Mr. Pelham in so princely a style\r\nthat that minister (with not the finest taste) rebuked him for his lavish\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant and witching Peg Woffington was the daughter of a small\r\nhuckster in Dublin, and became a pupil of Madame Violante, a rope-dancer.\r\nIn 1740 she came out at Covent Garden, and soon won the town as Sir Harry\r\nWildair. She played Lady Townley and Lady Betty Modish with “happy ease\r\nand gaiety.”[573] She rendered the most audacious absurdities pleasing by\r\nher beautiful bright face and her vivacity of expression. Peg quarrelled\r\nwith Kitty Clive and Mrs. Cibber, and detested that reckless woman George\r\nAnne Bellamy. This witty and enchanting actress, as generous and\r\ncharitable as Nell Gwynn with all her faults, was struck by paralysis\r\nwhile acting Rosalind at Covent Garden, and died in 1760.\r\n\r\nDuring his career from 1691 to his retirement in 1733, clever, careless\r\nColley Cibber originated nearly eighty characters, chiefly grand old fops,\r\ninane old men, dashing soldiers, and impudent lacqueys. His Fondlewife,\r\nSir Courtly Nice, and Shallow were his best parts. “Of all English\r\nmanagers,” says Dr. Doran, “Cibber was the most successful. Of the English\r\nactors, he is the only one who was ever promoted to the laureateship or\r\nelected a member of White’s Club.” Even Pope, who hated him and got some\r\nhard blows from him, praised “The Careless Husband;” Walpole, who despised\r\nplayers, praised Colley; and Dr. Johnson approved of his admirably written\r\n_Apology_.\r\n\r\nCibber’s daughter, Mrs. Clarke, led a wild and disreputable life, became a\r\nwaitress at Marylebone, and died in poverty in 1760. Colley’s son\r\nTheophilus, the best Pistol ever seen on the stage, and the original\r\nGeorge Barnwell, was drowned in crossing the Irish Sea.\r\n\r\nHis wife was a sister of Dr. Arne, the composer. In tragedy she was\r\nremarkable for her artless sensibility and exquisite variety of\r\nexpression. As Ophelia she moved even Tate Wilkinson. She was one of the\r\nfirst actresses to make the woes of the grand tragedy queen natural. She\r\ndied in 1766, and was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pritchard, that “inspired idiot,” as Dr. Johnson called her in his\r\ncontempt for her ignorance, seems to have been a virtuous woman. She left\r\nthe stage in 1768. Though plain, and in later years very stout, Mrs.\r\nPritchard was admired in tragedy for her perfect pronunciation and her\r\nforce and dignity as the Queen in “Hamlet,” and as Lady Macbeth. She was\r\nalso a good comedian in playful and witty parts. She was, however, not\r\nvery graceful, and inclined to rant.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Cibber died in 1765, Mrs. Yates succeeded to her fame, with Mrs.\r\nBarry for a rival, till Mrs. Siddons came from Bath and unseated both.\r\nMrs. Yates was wanting in pathos, but in pride and scorn as Medea, or in\r\nhopeless grief as Constance, she was unapproachable. She died in 1787.\r\n\r\nGeorge Anne Bellamy, the reckless and the unfortunate, was the daughter of\r\na Quakeress, with whom Lord Tyrawley ran away from school. Dr. Doran says,\r\n“What with the loves, caprices, charms, extravagances, and sufferings of\r\nMrs. Bellamy, she excited the wonder, admiration, pity, and contempt of\r\nthe town for thirty years.”[574] Now she was squandering money like a\r\nCleopatra; now she was crouching on the wet steps of Westminster Bridge,\r\nbrooding over suicide. “The Bellamy,” says the critic, was only equal to\r\n“the Cibber” in expressing the ecstasy of love. This follower of the old\r\nschool of intoners was the original Volumnia of Thomson, the Erixene of\r\nDr. Young, and the Cleone of the honest footman poet and publisher\r\nDodsley. She took her farewell benefit in 1784.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 Miss Farren appeared at Drury Lane. She was the daughter of a poor\r\nvagabond strolling player. Walpole says she was the most perfect actress\r\nhe had ever seen; and he spoke well of her fine ladies, of whom he was a\r\njudge. Adolphus, not easily appeased, praised her irresistible graces and\r\n“all the indescribable little charms which give fascination to the women\r\nof birth and fashion.” She was gay as Lady Betty Modish, sentimental as\r\nCecilia or Indiana, and playful as Rosara in the “Barber of Seville.” In\r\n1797 the little girl who had been helped over the ice to the lock-up at\r\nSalisbury, to hand up a bowl of milk to her father when a prisoner\r\nthere,[575] took leave of the stage in the part of Lady Teazle, and\r\nmarried the Earl of Derby, who had buried his wife just six weeks before.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 Mrs. Abington, “the best affected fine lady of her time,” retired\r\nfrom the stage of Drury Lane. She was the daughter of a common soldier,\r\nand as a girl was known as “Nosegay Fan,” and had sold flowers in St.\r\nJames’s Park. She first appeared at Drury Lane in 1756-7.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Robinson, the “Perdita” so heartlessly betrayed by the Prince of\r\nWales, was driven on to the stage in 1776 by her husband, a handsome\r\nscapegrace who had run through his fortune. She passed from the stage in\r\n1780, and died, forgotten, poor, and paralytic, in 1800.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 Samuel Reddish, Canning’s stepfather, first appeared at Drury Lane\r\nas Lord Townley. He was a reasonably good Edgar and Posthumus, but failed\r\nin parts of passion. He went mad in 1779. In this group of minor actors we\r\nmay include Gentleman Smith, a good Charles Surface, who retired from the\r\nstage in 1786; Yates, whose forte was old men and Shakspere’s fools\r\n(1736-1780); Dodd, who, from 1765 to 1796, was the prince of fops and old\r\nmen (Master Slender and Master Stephen were said to die with him); and\r\nlastly, that great comic actor, John Palmer, who died on the stage in\r\n1798, as he was playing the Stranger. He was the original representative\r\nof plausible Joseph Surface. “Plausible,” he used to say, “am I? You rate\r\nme too highly. The utmost I ever did in that way was that I once persuaded\r\na bailiff who had arrested me to bail me.” Once when making friends with\r\nSheridan after a quarrel, Palmer said to the author, “If you could but see\r\nmy heart, Mr. Sheridan!” to which Sheridan replied, “Why, Jack, you forgot\r\nI wrote it.” “Jack Palmer,” says Lamb, “was a gentleman with a slight\r\ninfusion of the footman.”[576] He had two voices, both plausible,\r\nhypocritical, and insinuating.\r\n\r\nHenderson was engaged by Sheridan for Drury Lane in 1777. As Falstaff this\r\nhumorous friend of Gainsborough was seldom equalled. His defects were a\r\nwoolly voice and a habit of sawing the air. Dr. Doran says, “he was the\r\nfirst actor who, with Sheridan, gave public readings” at Freemasons’ Hall;\r\nand his recitation of “John Gilpin” gave impetus to the sale of the\r\nnarrative of that adventurous ride.[577] Henderson died in 1785, aged only\r\nthirty-eight, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nMrs. Siddons, the daughter of an itinerant actor, was born in 1755. After\r\nstrolling and becoming a lady’s-maid, she married a poor second-rate actor\r\nof Birmingham. She appeared first at Drury Lane in 1775 as Portia. Her\r\nfirst real triumph was in 1780, as Isabella in Southerne’s tragedy. The\r\nmanagement gave her Garrick’s dressing-room, and some legal admirers\r\npresented her with a purse of a hundred guineas. Soon afterwards, as Jane\r\nShore, she sent many ladies in the audience into fainting fits. This great\r\nactress closed her career in 1812 with Lady Macbeth, her greatest triumph.\r\nShe is said to have made King George III. shed tears. He admired her\r\nespecially for her repose. “Garrick,” he used to say, “could never stand\r\nstill. He was a great fidget.” No actress received more homage in her time\r\nthan Mrs. Siddons. Reynolds painted his name on the hem of her garment in\r\nhis portrait of her as the Tragic Muse. Dr. Johnson kissed her hand and\r\nadmired her genius. In comedy Mrs. Siddons failed; her rigorous Grecian\r\nface was not arch. “In comedy” says Colman, “she was only a frisking\r\ngrig.” “Those who knew her best,” says Dr. Doran, “have recorded her\r\ngrace, her noble carriage, divine elocution and solemn earnestness, her\r\ngrandeur, her pathos, her correct judgment.” Erskine studied her cadences\r\nand tones. According to Campbell, she increased the heart’s capacity for\r\ntender, intense, and lofty feelings. This lofty-minded actress, as Young\r\ncalls her, died in 1831.\r\n\r\nHer elder brother, John Kemble, first appeared at Drury Lane, in 1783, as\r\nHamlet. In 1788-9 he succeeded King as manager of the theatre, and\r\ncontinued so till 1801. In Coriolanus and Cato, Kemble was pre-eminent,\r\nbut his Richard and Sir Giles were inferior to Cook’s and Kean’s. In\r\ncomedy he failed, except in snatches of dignity or pathos. As an actor\r\nKemble was sometimes heavy and monotonous. He had not the fire or\r\nversatility of Garrick, or the wild passion of Edmund Kean. As Hamlet he\r\nwas romantic, dignified, and philosophic. In his Rolla he delighted\r\nSheridan and Pitt; in Octavian he drew tears from all eyes. He excelled\r\nalso in Cœur de Lion, Penruddock, and the Stranger. In private life he was\r\nalways majestic and gravely convivial. When Covent Garden was burnt down\r\nin 1808, he bore the loss bravely, and on the night of the opening the\r\ngenerous Duke of Northumberland sent him back his bond for £10,000 to be\r\ncommitted to the flames. Walpole, who saw Kemble, preferred him to Garrick\r\nin Benedick, and to Quin in Maskwell. Kemble took his solemn farewell of\r\nthe stage in 1817 as Coriolanus, and died at Lausanne in 1823. Leigh Hunt,\r\nan excellent dramatic critic, paints the following picture of Kemble: “A\r\nfigure of melancholy dignity, dealing out a most measured speech in\r\nsepulchral tones and a pedantic pronunciation, and injuring what he has\r\nmade you feel by the want of feeling it himself.”[578] John Kemble’s\r\nbrother Charles acted well in Mercutio, Young Mirabel, and Benedick. He\r\nremained on the stage till 1836.\r\n\r\nGeorge Frederick Cooke, whose life was one perpetual debauch, and whose\r\ncareer on the stage extended from 1801 to 1812, when he died at Boston,\r\ndid not, I think, appear at Drury Lane. His laurels were won chiefly at\r\nCovent Garden.\r\n\r\nMaster Betty, born in 1791 at Shrewsbury, elegant, and quick of memory,\r\nappeared at Drury Lane in 1804, fretted his little hour upon the stage,\r\nand earned a fortune with which he prudently retired in 1808. He lived\r\ntill 1876.\r\n\r\nKing, the original representative of Sir Peter Teazle, Lord Ogleby, Puff,\r\nand Dr. Cantwell, began his London career at Drury Lane in 1748. He left\r\nthe stage in 1802. His best characters were Touchstone and Ranger, and in\r\nthese parts he was always arch, rapid, and versatile. Hazlitt discourses\r\non King’s old, hard, rough face, and his shrewd hints and tart replies.\r\n\r\nDickey Suett was a favourite low comedian from 1780 to 1805, when he died.\r\nHe was a tall, thin, ungainly man, too much addicted to grimace,\r\ninterpolations, and practical jokes. He drank hard, and suffered from\r\nmental depression. Hazlitt calls him “the delightful old croaker, the\r\neverlasting Dickey Gossip of the stage.”[579] Lamb describes his “Oh, la!”\r\nas irresistible; “he drolled upon the stock of those two syllables richer\r\nthan the cuckoo.” Shakspere’s jesters “have all the true Suett stamp--a\r\nloose and shambling gait, and a slippery tongue.”[580]\r\n\r\nMiss Pope, who left the stage in 1808, had played with Garrick and Mrs.\r\nClive. She was the original Polly Honeycomb, Miss Sterling, Mrs. Candour,\r\nand Tilburina. In youth she played hoydens, chambermaids, and half-bred\r\nladies, with a dash and good-humour free from all vulgarity, and in old\r\nage she took to duennas and Mrs. Heidelburg. In 1761 Churchill mentions\r\nher as “lively Pope,” and in 1807 Horace Smith describes her as “a bulky\r\nperson with a duplicity of chin.”\r\n\r\nIn 1741 the theatre, which had been rebuilt by Wren in 1674, in a cheap\r\nand plain manner, became ruinous, and was enlarged and almost rebuilt by\r\nthe Adams. In 1747 Garrick became the manager, and Dr. Johnson, as a\r\nfriend, wrote the celebrated address beginning with the often-quoted\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n  “When Learning’s triumph o’er her barbarous foes\r\n  First reared the stage, immortal Shakspere rose.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Each change of many-coloured life he drew,\r\n  Exhausted worlds, and then imagined new;\r\n  Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,\r\n  And panting Time toiled after him in vain.”\r\n\r\nIn 1775, the year in which “The Duenna” was brought out at Covent Garden,\r\nGarrick made known his wish to sell a moiety of the patent of this\r\ntheatre. In June 1776 a contract was signed, Mr. Sheridan taking\r\ntwo-fourteenths of the whole for £10,000, Mr. Linley the same, and Dr.\r\nFord three-fourteenths at £15,000.[581] How Sheridan raised the money no\r\none ever knew.\r\n\r\nSheridan’s first contribution to this new stage was an alteration of\r\nVanbrugh’s licentious comedy of “The Relapse,” which he called “A Trip to\r\nScarborough,” and brought out in 1777. The same year the brilliant\r\nmanager, then only six-and-twenty, produced the finest and most popular\r\ncomedy in the English language, “The School for Scandal.” On the last slip\r\nof this miracle of wit and dramatic construction Sheridan wrote--“Finished\r\nat last, thank God!--R. B. SHERIDAN.” Below this the prompter added his\r\ndevout response--“Amen.--W. HOPKINS.”[582] Garrick was proud of the new\r\nmanager, and boasted of his budding genius.[583]\r\n\r\nIn 1778 Sheridan bought out Mr. Lacy for more than £45,000, and Dr. Ford\r\nfor £77,000. In 1779 Garrick died, and Sheridan wrote a monody to his\r\nmemory, which was delivered by Mrs. Yates after the play of “The West\r\nIndian.” Slander attributed the finest passage in this monody to Tickell,\r\njust as it had before attributed Tickell’s bad farce to Sheridan.\r\n\r\nDowton, who appeared in 1796 as Sheva, was felicitous in good-natured\r\ntesty old men, and also in crabbed and degraded old villains. His Dr.\r\nCantwell and Sir Anthony Absolute were in the true spirit of old comedy.\r\nLeigh Hunt praises Dowton’s changes from the irritable to the yielding,\r\nand from the angry to the tender.\r\n\r\nWilly Blanchard was natural and unaffected, but mannered.\r\n\r\nMathews first appeared in London in 1803. He excelled in valets and old\r\nmen, and drew tears as M. Mallet, the poor emigré who is disappointed\r\nabout a letter.\r\n\r\nListon made his début at the Haymarket in 1805 as Sheepface. Leigh Hunt\r\npraises his ignorant rustics, and condemns his old men. He sets him down\r\nas a painter of emotions, and therefore more intellectual than Fawcett and\r\nless farcical than Munden. Liston was a hypochondriac; below his fun there\r\nwas always an under-current of melancholy, “as though,” says Dr. Doran,\r\nmysteriously, “he had killed a boy when, under the name of Williams, he\r\nwas usher at the Rev. Dr. Burney’s at Gosport.”[584]\r\n\r\nIn 1807 Jones and Young made their first appearances, but not at Drury\r\nLane. Young originated Rienzi, and played Hamlet, Falstaff, and Captain\r\nMacheath. Jones was a stage rake of great excellence.\r\n\r\nAmong the actresses before Kean, we may mention Miss Brunton, afterwards\r\nCountess of Craven, and Mrs. Davison, a good Lady Teazle.\r\n\r\nLewis, who left the stage in 1809, was a draper’s son. He died in 1813,\r\nand out of part of his fortune the new church at Ealing was erected. He\r\nplayed Young Rapid and Jeremy Diddler, and created the Hon. Tom\r\nShuffleton in “John Bull.” His restless style suited Morton and Reynolds’s\r\ncomedies, and he succeeded in “all that was frolic, gay, humorous,\r\nwhimsical, eccentric, and yet elegant.” He was manager of Covent Garden\r\nfor twenty-one years, and made everyone do his duty by kindness and good\r\ntreatment. Leigh Hunt sketches Lewis admirably, with his “easy\r\nflutter,”[585] short knowing respiration, and complacent liveliness. Lewis\r\nplayed the gentleman with more heart than Elliston. He seemed polite, not\r\nfrom vanity, but rather from a natural irresistible wish to please. He had\r\nall the laborious carelessness of action, important indifference of voice,\r\nand natural vacuity of look that are requisite for the lounger.[586] His\r\ndefects were a habit of shaking his head and drawing in of the breath. His\r\n“flippant airiness,” “vivacious importance,” and “French flutter” must\r\nhave been in their way perfect. “Gay, fluttering, hair-brained Lewis!”\r\nsays Hazlitt; “nobody could break open a door, or jump over a table, or\r\nscale a ladder, or twirl a cocked hat, or dangle a cane, or play a\r\njockey-nobleman or a nobleman’s jockey like him.”[587]\r\n\r\nHere a moment’s pause for an anecdote. When a riot took place at Drury\r\nLane in 1740 about the non-appearance of a French dancer, the first\r\nsymptoms of the outbreak were the ushering of ladies out of the pit. A\r\nnoble marquis gallantly proposed to fire the house. The proposal was\r\nconsidered, but not adopted. The bucks and bloods then proceeded to\r\ndestroy the musical instruments and fittings, to break the panels and\r\npartitions, and pull down the royal arms. The offence was finally condoned\r\nby the ringleading marquis sending £100 to the manager.\r\n\r\nCharles Lamb describes Drury Lane in his own delightful way. The first\r\nplay he ever saw was in 1781-2, when he was six years old. “A portal, now\r\nthe entrance,” he writes, “to a printing-office, at the north end of Cross\r\nCourt was the pit entrance to old Drury; and I never pass it without\r\nshaking some forty years from off my shoulders, recurring to the evening\r\nwhen I passed through it to see my first play. The afternoon was wet: with\r\nwhat a beating heart did I watch from the window the puddles!\r\n\r\n“It was the custom then to cry, ‘’Chase some oranges, ’chase some\r\nnonpareils, ’chase a bill of the play?’ But when we got in, and I beheld\r\nthe green curtain that veiled a heaven to my imagination, the breathless\r\nanticipations I endured! The boxes, full of well-dressed women of quality,\r\nprojected over the pit. The orchestra lights arose--the bell sounded\r\nonce--it rang the second time--the curtain drew up, and the play was\r\n‘Artaxerxes;’ ‘Harlequin’s Invasion’ followed.”\r\n\r\nThe next play Lamb went to was “The Lady of the Manor,” followed by a\r\npantomime called “Lunn’s Ghost.” Rich was not long dead. His third play\r\nwas “The Way of the World” and “Robinson Crusoe.” Six or seven years after\r\nhe went (with what changed feelings!) to see Mrs. Siddons in Isabella.\r\n“Comparison and retrospection,” he says, “soon yielded to the present\r\nattraction of the scene, and the theatre became to me, upon a new stock,\r\nthe most delightful of all recreations.”[588]\r\n\r\nHandsome Jack Bannister, who played in youth with Garrick, and in later\r\nyears with Edmund Kean, was the model for the Uncle Toby in Leslie’s\r\npicture. Natural, honest, as Hamlet, he was also good as Walter in “The\r\nChildren of the Wood.” Inimitable “in depicting heartiness,” says Dr.\r\nDoran, “ludicrous distress, grave or affected indifference, honest\r\nbravery, insurmountable cowardice, a spirited young or an enfeebled yet\r\nimpatient old fellow, mischievous boyishness, good-humoured vulgarity,\r\nthere was no one of his time who could equal him.”[589] Bannister left the\r\nstage with a handsome fortune. Hazlitt says finely of him that his\r\n“gaiety, good-humour, cordial feeling, and natural spirits shone through\r\nhis characters and lighted them up like a transparency.”[590] His kind\r\nheart and honest face were as well known as his good-humoured smile and\r\nbuoyant activity. “Jack,” says Lamb, “was beloved for his sweet,\r\ngood-natured moral pretensions.” He gave us “a downright concretion of a\r\nWapping sailor, a jolly warm-hearted Jack Tar.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan’s mother was the daughter of a Welsh clergyman who had eloped\r\nwith an officer. The débutante came out at Drury Lane in 1785 as the\r\nheroine of “The Country Girl.” In 1789 she became the mistress of the Duke\r\nof Clarence. Good-natured, and endowed with a sweet clear voice, she\r\nplayed rakes with the airiest grace, and excelled in representing arch,\r\nbuoyant girls, spirited, buxom, lovable women, and handsome hoydens. The\r\ncritics complained of her as vulgar. Late in life she retired to France,\r\nand died in 1815. “Her wealth,” says Dr. Doran, “was lavished on the Duke\r\nof Clarence, who left her to die untended; but when he became king he\r\nennobled all her children, the eldest being made Earl of Munster.”\r\nHazlitt, speaking of Mrs. Jordan, says eloquently, her voice “was a\r\ncordial to the heart, because it came from it full, like the luscious\r\njuice of the rich grape. To hear her laugh was to drink nectar. Her smile\r\nwas sunshine; her talking far above singing; her singing was like the\r\ntwanging of Cupid’s bow. Her body was large, soft, and generous like the\r\nrose. Miss Kelly, if we may accept the judgment of Hazlitt, was in\r\ncomparison a mere dexterous, knowing chambermaid. Jordan was all\r\nexuberance and grace. It was her capacity for enjoyment, and the contrast\r\nshe presented to everything sharp, angular, and peevish, that delighted\r\nthe spectator. She was Cleopatra turned into an oyster wench.”[591]\r\nCharles Lamb praises Mrs. Jordan for her tenderness in such parts as\r\nOphelia, Helena, and Viola, and for her “steady, melting eye.”[592]\r\n\r\nRobert William Elliston was the son of a Bloomsbury watchmaker, and was\r\nborn in 1774. He appeared in London first in 1797, and obtained a triumph\r\nas Sir Edward Mortimer, a part in which Kemble had failed. He is praised\r\nby Dr. Doran as one of the best of stage gentlemen, not being so reserved\r\nand languid as Charles Kemble. All the qualities that go to the making of\r\na gallant were conspicuous in his Duke Aranza--self-command, kindness,\r\ndignity, good-humour, a dash of satire, and true amatory fire; but then\r\nhis voice was too pompously deep in soliloquy, and he was too genteel in\r\nlow comedy. As a stage lover he was impassioned, tender, and courteous,\r\nyet he would persist in one uniform dress--blue coat, white waistcoat, and\r\nwhite knee-breeches. Yet, though a self-deceiving and pompous humbug,\r\nCharles Lamb reverenced him and Leigh Hunt admired his acting. In turn\r\nproprietor of the Olympic, the Surrey, and Drury Lane theatres, Elliston\r\noutlived his fame and fortune. When acting George IV. in a sham coronation\r\nprocession, having taken too much preliminary wine, he became so affected\r\nat the delight of the audience that he gave them his grandest benediction\r\nin these affecting words, “Bless you, my people!” When Douglas Jerrold\r\nsaved the Surrey Theatre by his “Black-eyed Susan,” Elliston declared such\r\nservices should be acknowledged by a presentation of plate--not by\r\nhimself, however, but by Jerrold’s own friends. Elliston’s last appearance\r\nwas in 1826, and he died in 1831.\r\n\r\nHull, a heavy, useful, and intelligent actor, left the stage in 1807.\r\nHolman, an exaggerating actor, had a career that lasted from 1784 to 1800.\r\nMunden, the broadest of farceurs and drollest of grimacers, appeared first\r\nin 1790 as Sir Francis Gripe, and last, in 1823, as Sir Robert Bramble and\r\nDozey. His Crack in “The Turnpike Gate” was one of his greatest parts; but\r\nI am afraid he would be now thought too much of the buffoon. Charles Lamb\r\ndevotes a whole essay to the subject of Munden’s acting as Cockletop, Sir\r\nChristopher Curry, Old Dornton, and the Cobbler of Preston. He says of\r\nhim: “When you think he has exhausted his battery of looks in\r\nunaccountable warfare with your gravity, suddenly he sprouts out an\r\nentirely new set of features, like Hydra. He, and he alone, makes faces.\r\nIn the grand grotesque of farce, Munden stands out as single and\r\nunaccompanied as Hogarth. Can any man wonder like him, any man see ghosts\r\nlike him, or fight with his own shadow?”[593]\r\n\r\nLamb praises Dodd for a face formally flat in Foppington, frothily pert in\r\nFattle, and blankly expressive of no meaning in Acres and Fribble.[594]\r\n\r\nIn 1792 Sheridan’s affairs began to get entangled. The surveyors reported\r\nthe theatre unsafe and incapable of repair, and it was therefore resolved\r\nto build a new one at a cost of £150,000 by means of 300 shares at £500\r\neach. In the meantime, while Sheridan was paying interest for his loan,\r\nthe company was playing at an enormous expense on borrowed stages; and the\r\ncareless and profuse manager, his prudent wife now dead, was maintaining\r\nthree establishments--one at Wanstead, one at Isleworth, and one in Jermyn\r\nStreet. In 1794 a new Theatre was built by Henry Holland.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 that masterpiece of false, hysterical German sentiment, “The\r\nStranger” (translated from Kotzebue), was rewritten by Sheridan, and\r\nbrought out at his own theatre. This was one of the earliest importations\r\nof the Germanism that Canning afterwards, for political purposes, so\r\npungently denounced in the _Anti-Jacobin_. The great success of “The\r\nStranger,” and the false taste it had implanted, induced Sheridan, in\r\n1799, to bring out the play of “Pizarro.” He wrote scarcely anything in it\r\nbut the speech of Rolla, which is itself an amplification of a few lines\r\nof the original.\r\n\r\nThe new theatre was to have cost £75,000, and the £150,000 subscribed for\r\nwas to have paid the architect and defrayed the mortgage debts. The\r\ntheatre, however, cost more than £150,000; only part of the debt was paid\r\noff, and a claim of £70,000 remained upon the property.[595]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February 1809, while the House of Commons was occupied with\r\nMr. Ponsonby’s motion on the conduct of the war in Spain, the debate was\r\ninterrupted by a great glare of light through the windows. When the cause\r\nwas ascertained, so much sympathy was felt for Sheridan that it was\r\nproposed to adjourn; but Sheridan calmly rose and said, “that whatever\r\nmight be the extent of his private calamity, he hoped it would not\r\ninterfere with the public business of the country.” He then left the\r\nhouse, and is said to have reached Drury Lane just in time to find all\r\nhope of saving his property abandoned. According to one story he coolly\r\nproceeded to the Piazza Coffee-house and discussed a bottle of wine,\r\nreplying to a friend who praised his philosophic calmness, “Why, a man may\r\nsurely be allowed to take a glass of wine _at his own fireside_.”[596] He\r\nis said to have been most grieved at the loss of a harpsichord that had\r\nbelonged to his wife.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the opening presented, and at the tardiness of shareholders\r\nto rebuild, speculators now proposed to erect a third theatre; but this\r\ndesign Sheridan and his friends defeated, and Mr. Whitbread, the great\r\nbrewer of Chiswell Street, Finsbury, who afterwards destroyed himself,\r\nexerted his energies in the rebuilding of it.\r\n\r\nBy the new agreement of 1811, Sheridan was to receive for his moiety\r\n£24,000, and an additional sum of £4000 for the property of the\r\nfruit-offices and the reversion of boxes and shares; his son also\r\nreceiving his quarter of the patent property. Out of this sum the claims\r\nof the Linley family and other creditors were to be satisfied.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed with debt, dogged by bailiffs, hurried to and from\r\nsponging-houses, Sheridan, now a broken-down man, died in 1816,\r\nreproaching the committee with his last breath for refusing to lend him\r\nmore money.\r\n\r\nThe new theatre, built by Mr. B. Wyatt, had been opened in October 1812,\r\nthe performances consisting of “Hamlet” and “The Devil to Pay.” The house\r\nheld 800 persons less than its predecessor. The proprietors being anxious\r\nto have an opening address equal to that of Dr. Johnson, advertised for a\r\nsuitable poem, and professed a desire for an open and free competition.\r\nThe verses were, like Oxford competition poems, to be marked with a word,\r\nnumber, or motto, and the appended sealed paper containing the name of\r\nthe writer was not to be opened unless the poem was successful. They\r\noffered twenty guineas as the prize, and extended the time for sending in\r\nthe poems. The result was an avalanche of mediocrity, till the secretary’s\r\ndesk and the treasury-office ran over with poems. The proprietors were in\r\ndespair, when Lord Holland prevailed on Lord Byron to write an address, at\r\nthe risk, as the poet feared, “of offending a hundred rival scribblers and\r\na discerning public.” The poem was written and accepted, and delivered on\r\nthe special night by Mr. Elliston, who performed the part of Hamlet. The\r\naddress was voted tame by the newspapers, with the exception of the\r\nfollowing passage--\r\n\r\n  “As soars this fane to emulate the last,\r\n  Oh, might we draw our omens from the past?\r\n  Some hour propitious to our prayers, may boast\r\n  Names such as hallow still the dome we lost.\r\n  On Drury first your Siddons’ thrilling art\r\n  O’erwhelmed the gentlest, stormed the sternest heart;\r\n  On Drury Garrick’s latest laurels grew;\r\n  Here your last tears retiring Roscius drew,\r\n  Sigh’d his last thanks, and wept his last adieu.”\r\n\r\nThe brothers Smith eagerly seized this fine opportunity for parody, and\r\nthe “Rejected Addresses” made all London shake with laughter.\r\n\r\nThe leaden statue of Shakspere over the entrance of old Drury Lane was\r\nexecuted by Cheere of Hyde Park Corner--“the leaden figure man” formerly\r\nso celebrated--from a design by Scheemakers, a native of Antwerp and the\r\nmaster of Nollekens. When this sculptor first went to Rome to study, he\r\ntravelled on foot, and had to sell his shirts by the way in order to\r\nprocure funds. Mr. Whitbread, one of Sheridan’s creditors, gave the figure\r\nto the theatre.[597]\r\n\r\nMr. Whitbread and a committee had erected the house and purchased the old\r\npatent rights by means of a subscription of £400,000. Of this £20,000 was\r\npaid to Sheridan, and a like sum to the other holders of the patent. The\r\ncreditors of the old house took a quarter of what they claimed in full\r\npayment, and the Duke of Bedford abandoned a claim of £12,000. The company\r\nconsisted of Elliston, Dowton, Bannister, Rae, Wallack, Wewitzer, Miss\r\nSmith, Mrs. Davison, Mrs. Glover, Miss Kelly, and Miss Mellon. Mr. C.\r\nKemble and Grimaldi were at the other house, that the next season boasted\r\na strong company--John and Charles Kemble, Conway, Terry, and Matthews. At\r\nDrury Lane no new piece was brought out except Coleridge’s “Remorse.” At\r\nCovent Garden there was played “Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp.”\r\n\r\nAt Drury Lane, says Dr. Doran, neither new pieces nor new players\r\nsucceeded, till on the 20th of January 1814, the play-bills announced the\r\nfirst appearance of an actor from Exeter, whose coming changed the evil\r\nfortunes of the house, scared the old correct, dignified, and classical\r\nschool of actors, and brought again to the memories of those who could\r\nlook back as far as Garrick the fire, nature, impulse, and terrible\r\nearnestness--all, in short, but the versatility, of that great master in\r\nhis art. This player was Edmund Kean.\r\n\r\nKean was born in 1787. He was the son of a low and worthless actress,\r\nwhose father, George Saville Carey, a poor singer, reciter, and mimic,\r\nhanged himself. The father of Carey was a dramatist and song-writer, the\r\nnatural son of the great Lord Halifax, who died in 1695. Kean’s father is\r\nunknown: he may have been Aaron Kean the tailor, or Moses Kean the\r\nbuilder. In early life the genius was cabin-boy, strolling player, dancer\r\non the tight-rope, and elocutionist at country fairs. His first\r\nappearance, as Shylock, in 1814, was a triumph. That night he came home\r\nand promised his wife a carriage, and his son Charles (then in his cradle)\r\nan education at Eton. In Richard III. he soon attained great triumphs. He\r\nwas audacious, sneering, devilish, almost supernatural in his cruelty and\r\nhypocrisy. His Hamlet, though graceful and earnest, was inferior to his\r\nOthello; but Kemble thought that the latter was a mistake, Othello being\r\npalpably “a slow man.” When Southey saw Kean and Young, he said, “It is\r\nthe arch-fiend himself.” When Kean played Sir Giles Overreach, and\r\nremoved it from Kemble’s repertory, his wife received him on his return\r\nfrom the theatre with the anxious question, “What did Lord Essex think of\r\nit?” The triumphant reply is well known: “D---- Lord Essex, Mary! the pit\r\nrose at me.”\r\n\r\nIn 1822, after a visit to America, Kean appeared with his rival Young in a\r\nseries of characters, though he never liked “the Jesuit,” as he used to\r\ncall Young. In 1827, Kean’s son Charles appeared as Norval at Drury Lane,\r\nwhile his father, now sinking fast, was acting at Covent Garden. In 1833\r\nKean, shattered and exhausted, played Othello to his son’s Iago, and died\r\ntwo months after.\r\n\r\nHazlitt has a fine comparison between Kean and Mrs. Siddons. Mrs. Siddons\r\nnever seemed to task her powers to the utmost. Her least word seemed to\r\nfloat to the end of the stage; the least motion of her hand commanded\r\nobedience. “Mr. Kean,” he says, “is all effort, all violence, all extreme\r\npassion; he is possessed with a fury and demon that leaves him no repose,\r\nno time for thought, nor room for imagination.[598] Mr. Kean’s imagination\r\nappears not to have the principles of joy or hope or love in it. He seems\r\nchiefly sensible to pain and to the passion that springs from it, and to\r\nthe terrible energies of mind or body which are necessary to grapple with\r\nor to avert it.”[599]\r\n\r\nThe new theatre had small success under its committee of proprietors, and\r\nsoon became involved in debt and unable to pay the performers. In 1814 it\r\nwas let to the highest bidder, Elliston, who took it at the yearly rental\r\nof £10,300, and expended £15,000 on repairs. Captain Polhill afterwards\r\nbecame the lessee, and sunk in it large sums of money. The two next\r\nlessees, Messrs. Bunn and Hammond, became bankrupts. Towards the middle of\r\n1840 the house was reopened, after a closing of some months, for the then\r\nnew entertainments of promenade concerts.\r\n\r\nGrimaldi, the son of Queen Charlotte’s dentist, was born in 1779. He made\r\nhis début at Drury lane in a “Robinson Crusoe” pantomime in 1781, and\r\nretired from the stage in 1828. His first part of any importance was\r\nOrson. He remained at Drury Lane for nearly five-and-twenty years, and\r\nthen played alternately at Covent Garden and Sadler’s Wells every night.\r\n“He was the very beau-ideal of thieves,” says a critic of the time:\r\n“robbery became a science in his hand; you forgave the larceny from the\r\nhumour with which Joe indulged his irresistible weakness.”[600] He was\r\nfamous for his rich ringing laugh, his complacent chuckle, the roll of his\r\neyes, the drop of his chin, and his elongated respiration. But we must go\r\nback to the singers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crouch, the great singer, and the daughter of a Gray’s Inn Lane\r\nattorney, was articled to Mr. Linley, patentee of Drury Lane, in 1779, and\r\nin 1780 made her début as Mandane. In 1785 she married a lieutenant in the\r\nnavy, but returned to the stage in 1786, to be eclipsed by Mrs.\r\nBillington. In 1787 she acted with Kelly at Drury Lane in the opera of\r\n“Richard Cœur de Lion,” and in the same year, in the character of Selima,\r\nsang the once popular song of “No Flower that blows is like the Rose.” In\r\n1788 she played Lady Elinor in “The Haunted Tower” at Drury Lane. She died\r\nin 1804.\r\n\r\nMrs. Billington, the daughter of a German musician, was born in London in\r\n1765. In 1801-2 she sang alternately at Drury Lane and Covent Garden. She\r\ndied in 1818. Bianchi wrote for this lady the opera of “Inez de Castro.”\r\nShe is said to have played and sung at sight Mozart’s “Clemenza di Tito;”\r\nher voice ranged from D to G in altissimo. She indulged too much in\r\nornament, but was especially celebrated for her “Soldier tired of War’s\r\nAlarms.”\r\n\r\nJohn Braham, a Jew pencil-boy--so the musical _on dit_ goes--was brought\r\nup by a singer at the Duke’s Place Synagogue. He made his début in 1787.\r\nHe appeared first, in 1796, in Storace’s opera of “Mahmoud,” at Drury\r\nLane. The compass of his song, “Let Glory’s Clarion,” extended over\r\nseventeen notes. He died in 1856.\r\n\r\nStorace, born in 1763, died in 1796. He was the son of an Italian\r\ndouble-bass player, was engaged by Linley to compose for Drury Lane, and\r\nfor that theatre wrote the following operas:--“The Siege of Belgrade,”\r\n1792: “Lodoiska,” 1794; and “The Iron Chest,” 1796. This brilliant young\r\nman wrote chiefly for Braham and Kelly.\r\n\r\nMadame Storace made her début at Drury Lane, in 1789, in her brother’s\r\ncomic opera of “The Haunted Tower.”\r\n\r\nBishop, who was born about 1780, produced his opera of “The Mysterious\r\nBride” at Drury Lane in 1808. In 1809, the night preceding the fire,\r\nBishop produced his first great success, “The Circassian Bride,” the score\r\nof which was burnt. After being long at Covent Garden, Bishop, in 1826,\r\nproduced his “Aladdin” at Drury Lane to compete with Weber’s “Oberon” at\r\nCovent Garden. In 1827 he adapted Rossini’s “Turco in Italia;” and in\r\n1830, for Drury Lane, he adapted Rossini’s “William Tell.”\r\n\r\nMichael Kelly, born in 1762, made his first appearance at Drury Lane in\r\n1787. In his jovial career Kelly composed “The Castle Spectre,” “Blue\r\nBeard” (the march in which is very pompously oriental and fine), “Of Age\r\nTo-morrow,” “Deaf and Dumb,” etc. He also wrote many Italian, English, and\r\nFrench songs, and had a good tenor voice. He became superintendent of\r\nmusic at the Drury Lane Theatre, and died in 1826. He was an agreeable\r\nman, and much esteemed by George IV. Parkes accuses him of a want of\r\nknowledge of harmony, and of stealing from the Italians.\r\n\r\nIn May 1836 Madame Malibran (de Beriot) appeared at Drury Lane as Isolina\r\nin Balfe’s “Maid of Artois,” which was a great success. At the close of\r\nthe season she went abroad. Returned in September, she sang at the\r\nManchester Festival, and after a duet with Madame Caradori Allen, was\r\ntaken ill, and died a few days after. This gifted woman, the daughter of a\r\nSpanish Jew (an opera-singer), was born in 1808.\r\n\r\nTo return to our last batch of actors. James Wallack, born in 1792, began\r\nto be known about 1816, and in 1820 was principal tragedian at Drury\r\nLane. His Hamlet, Rolla, and Romeo were very manly and bearable. He\r\nafterwards became stage-manager at Drury Lane, and was praised for his\r\nlight comedy.\r\n\r\nCharles Young, who played with Kean at Drury Lane, was a dignified but\r\nrather cold actor. Booth appeared also with Kean in 1817, and again in\r\n1820 with Wallack and Cooper.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mardyn (the supposed mistress of Lord Byron) appeared on the Drury\r\nLane stage in 1815. She was boisterous, but so full of girlish gaiety and\r\nreckless wildness that she became for a short time the favourite of the\r\ntown. She failed, however, when she reappeared in 1833 in a tragic part.\r\n\r\nCharming Mrs. Nisbett, “that peach of a woman,” as Douglas Jerrold used to\r\ncall her, died in 1858, aged forty-five. The daughter of a drunken Irish\r\nofficer who took to the stage, she married an officer in the Life Guards\r\nin 1831; but on the death of her husband by an accident, she returned to\r\nher first love in 1832, and reappeared at Drury Lane. Her great triumph\r\nwas “The Love Chase,” which was produced at the Haymarket in 1837, and ran\r\nfor nearly one hundred nights. It was worth going a hundred miles to hear\r\nMrs. Nisbett’s merry, ringing, silvery laugh.\r\n\r\nIrish Johnstone, who died in 1828, is described by Hazlitt as acting at\r\nDrury Lane, “with his supple knees, his hat twisted round in his hand, his\r\ngood-humoured laugh, his arched eyebrows, his insinuating leer, and his\r\nlubricated brogue curling round the ear like a well-oiled\r\nmoustachio.”[601]\r\n\r\nOxberry quitted Drury Lane with Elliston in 1820. In 1821 he took the\r\nCraven’s Head Chop-house in Drury Lane, where he used to say to his\r\nguests, “We vocalise on a Friday, conversationalise on a Sunday, and\r\nchopise every day.” His best characters were Leo Luminati, Slender, and\r\nAbel Day. Emery surpassed him in Tyke, Little Knight, and Robin Roughhead.\r\n\r\nFarren, who was born about 1787, made his début at Covent Garden in 1818.\r\nHe was for some time at Drury Lane, and latterly manager of the Olympic.\r\nIn old men he took the place of Dowton. His finest performance was Lord\r\nOgleby, but in his prime he excelled also in Sir Peter Teazle, Sir Anthony\r\nAbsolute, Sir Fretful Plagiary, and the Bailie Nicol Jarvie.\r\n\r\nJohn Pritt Harley was the son of a silk-mercer, and originally a clerk in\r\nChancery Lane. He was born in 1786 or 1790. He made his début at the\r\nLyceum in 1815, in “The Devil’s Bridge.” His first appearance at Drury\r\nLane was in 1815, as Lissardo in “The Wonder.” In farce he was\r\ngood-humoured, bustling, and droll; and he excelled in Caleb Quotem, Peter\r\nFidget, Bottom, and many Shaksperean characters. He died only a year or\r\ntwo ago, repeating, it is said, this line of one of his old parts: “I have\r\nan exposition of sleep come upon me.”\r\n\r\nMiss Kelly, born in 1790, was at the Lyceum in 1808, and went from thence\r\nto Drury Lane. She sang in operas, and was admirable in genteel comedy and\r\ndomestic tragedy. Her romps were scarcely inferior to Mrs. Jordan’s; her\r\nwaiting-maids were equal to Mrs. Orger’s. Charles Lamb, writing in 1818,\r\nsays of her--\r\n\r\n  “Your tears have passion in them, and a grace,\r\n    A genuine freshness which our hearts avow;\r\n  Your smiles are winds whose ways we cannot trace,\r\n    That vanish and return we know not how.”\r\n\r\nMiss Kelly was twice shot at while acting. In both cases the cruel\r\nassailants were rejected admirers.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Mrs. Glover took her farewell benefit at Drury Lane; Farren and\r\nMadame Vestris taking parts in the performance--Mrs. Glover playing Mrs.\r\nMalaprop. She was born in 1779, and had made her first appearance as\r\nElvina in good Hannah More’s dull tragedy, at Covent Garden, in 1797.\r\nBeautiful in youth, Mrs. Glover had gracefully passed from sighing Juliets\r\nand maundering Elvinas into Mrs. Heidelbergs, Mrs. Candours, and the Nurse\r\nin “Romeo and Juliet.”\r\n\r\nRobert Keeley, who was brought up a compositor, was born in Grange Court,\r\nCarey Street, in 1794. He acted at Drury Lane as early as 1819, and at the\r\nAdelphi as early as 1826 as Jemmy Green in “Tom and Jerry.” In 1834 we\r\nfind the critics ranking him below Liston and Reeve, but he was very\r\npopular in his representations of cowardly fear and stupid chuckling\r\nastonishment. He left the stage for several years before his death. Miss\r\nHelen Faucit, born in 1816, was the original heroine of Sir Bulwer\r\nLytton’s and Mr. Browning’s plays. Her Beatrice, Imogen, and Rosalind were\r\nadmirable, and her Antigone was a great success. She retired from the\r\nstage in 1851, when she married Mr. Theodore Martin, the accomplished\r\ntranslator of Horace and Catullus, and the joint author with Professor\r\nAytoun of those admirable burlesque ballads of “Bon Gaultier.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Charles Macready, the son of a Dublin upholsterer, appeared in\r\nLondon first in 1816. Kean approved his Orestes, and he soon advanced to\r\nRob Roy, Virginius, and Coriolanus. He then removed to Drury Lane, and\r\ndistinguished himself as Caius Gracchus and William Tell, in two of Mr.\r\nSheridan Knowles’s plays. He reappeared at Drury Lane in 1826. The critics\r\nsaid that he failed in Rolla and Hamlet, but excelled in Rob Roy,\r\nCoriolanus, and Richard. He himself preferred his own Hamlet. They\r\ncomplained that he had a burr in his enunciation, and a catching of the\r\nbreath--that he was too fond of declamation and violent transitions;\r\nothers thought him too heavy and colloquial. In 1826 he went to America,\r\nwhere the fatal riot of Forrest’s partisans occurred, and twenty-two men\r\nwere killed. His season closed at Drury Lane in 1843. His benefit took\r\nplace in 1851, and he then retired from the stage to live the life of a\r\nquiet, useful country gentleman in the west of England. He died in 1873,\r\nand lies buried at Kensal Green.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Kean, struggling with a bad voice and a mean figure, had a\r\nhard fight for success, and won it only by the most dauntless\r\nperseverance. Born in 1811, he appeared for the first time upon the boards\r\nas Norval, in 1827. After repeated failures in London and much success in\r\nthe provinces and America, Mr. Kean accepted an engagement at Drury Lane\r\nin 1838--Mr. Bunn offering him £50 a night. He succeeded in Hamlet, and\r\nwas presented with a silver vase of the value of £200. In Richard and Sir\r\nGiles Overreach he also triumphed. In 1843 Mr. Kean renewed his engagement\r\nwith Mr. Bunn. Before retiring from the stage and starting for Australia,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Kean performed for many nights at Drury Lane. Charles Kean\r\ndied in 1868.\r\n\r\nMiss Ellen Tree first performed at Drury Lane as Violante in “The Wonder.”\r\nShe married Mr. C. Kean in 1842, and aided him in those\r\nantiquarianly-correct spectacles that for a time rendered a scholarly,\r\ncareful, but scarcely first-rate actor popular in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nWe have room in this brief and imperfect _résumé_ of theatrical history\r\nfor only two pictures of Drury Lane. One is in 1800, when George III. was\r\nfired at by Hatfield as he entered the house to witness Cribber’s comedy\r\nof “She Would and She Would Not.” When the Marquis of Salisbury would have\r\ndrawn him away, the brave, obstinate king said--“Sir, you discompose me as\r\nwell as yourself: I shall not stir one step.” The queen and princesses\r\nwere in tears all the evening, but George III. sat calm and collected,\r\nstaring through his single-barrel opera-glass. In 1783 the king, queen,\r\nand Prince of Wales went to Drury Lane to see Mrs. Siddons play Isabella.\r\nThey sat under a dome of crimson velvet and gold. The king wore a\r\nQuaker-coloured dress with gold buttons, while the handsome scapegrace\r\nprince was adorned in blue Genoa velvet.\r\n\r\nMr. Planché, the accomplished writer of extravaganzas and the _Somerset\r\nHerald_, brought out his burlesque of “Amoroso, King of Little Britain,”\r\nat Drury Lane in 1818. He afterwards wrote the libretto of “Maid Marian”\r\nfor Mr. Bishop, and that of “Oberon” for Weber. In 1828 his “Charles XII.”\r\nwas produced at Drury Lane.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Falconer’s clever imitative experiments we have no room to dilate.\r\nThe “Peep o’ Day,” a piece which reproduced all the “Colleen Bawn”\r\neffects, was the best.\r\n\r\nAnd now leaving the theatres for meaner places, we pass on to the district\r\nof the butchers. Clare Market stands on a spot formerly called Clement’s\r\nInn Fields, and was built by the Earl of Clare, who lived close by, in\r\n1657. The family names, Denzil, Holles, etc., are retained in the\r\nneighbouring streets.\r\n\r\nThis market became notorious in Pope’s time for the buffoonery, noisy\r\nimpudence, and extravagances of Orator Henley, a sort of ecclesiastical\r\noutlaw of a not very religious age, who tried to make his impudence and\r\nconceit pass for genius. This street-orator, the son of a Leicestershire\r\nvicar, was born in 1692. After going to St. John’s College, Cambridge, he\r\nreturned home, kept a school, wrote a poem called “Esther,” and began a\r\nUniversal Grammar in ten languages. Heated by an itch for reforming, and\r\ntired of the country, or driven away, as some say, by a scandalous\r\nembarrassment, he hurried to London, and for a short time did duty at a\r\nchapel in Bedford Row. During this time, under the Earl of Macclesfield’s\r\npatronage, he translated Pliny’s epistles, Vertot’s works, and\r\nMontfaucon’s Italian travels. He then competed for a lecturership in\r\nBloomsbury, but failed, the parishioners not disliking his language or his\r\ndoctrine, but complaining that he threw himself about too much in the\r\npulpit.\r\n\r\nNow, “regular action” was one of Henley’s peculiar prides. The rejection\r\nhurt his vanity and nearly drove him crazy. Losing his temper, he rushed\r\ninto the vestry-room. “Blockheads!” he roared, “are _you_ qualified to\r\njudge of the degree of action necessary for a preacher of God’s Word? Were\r\nyou able to read, or had got sufficient sense, you sorry knaves, to\r\nunderstand the renowned orator of antiquity, he would tell you almost the\r\nonly requisite of a public speaker was ACTION, ACTION, ACTION. But I\r\ndespise and defy you: _provoco ad populum_; the public shall decide\r\nbetween us.” He then hurried from the room, soon afterwards published his\r\nprobationary discourse, and taking a room in Newport Market, started as\r\nquack divine and public lecturer.\r\n\r\nBut he first consulted the eccentric and heretical Whiston, whom Swift\r\nbantered so ruthlessly--Whiston being, like Henley, a Leicestershire\r\nman--as to whether he should incur any legal penalties by officiating as a\r\nseparatist from the Church of England. Whiston, himself an expelled\r\nprofessor, tried to dissuade the Orator from his wild project.\r\nDisagreement and abuse followed, and the correspondence ended with the\r\nfollowing final bomb-shell from the violent demagogue:--\r\n\r\n    “To Mr. WILLIAM WHISTON,\r\n\r\n    “Take notice that I give you warning not to enter my room in Newport\r\n    Market, at your peril.\r\n\r\n      “JOHN HENLEY.”[602]\r\n\r\nThe Orator patronised divinity on Sundays, and secular subjects on\r\nWednesdays and Fridays. The admittance was one shilling. He also published\r\noutrageous pamphlets and a weekly farrago called The _Hyp-Doctor_,\r\nintended to antidote _The Craftsman_, and for which pompous nonsense Sir\r\nRobert Walpole is said to have given him £100 a year. He also attacked\r\neminent persons, even Pope, from his pulpit. Every Saturday an\r\nadvertisement of the subject of his next week’s oration appeared in the\r\n_Daily Advertiser_, preceded by a sarcastic or libellous motto, and\r\nsometimes an offer that if any one at home or abroad could be found to\r\nsurpass him, he would surrender his Oratory at once to his conqueror.\r\n\r\nIn 1729 Henley, growing perhaps more popular, removed to Clare Market,\r\nwhere the butchers became his warm partisans and served as his body-guard.\r\nThe following are two of his shameless advertisements:--\r\n\r\n“At the Oratory in Newport Market, to-morrow, at half an hour after ten,\r\nthe sermon will be on the Witch of Endor. At half an hour after five, the\r\ntheological lecture will be on the conversion and original of the Scottish\r\nnation and of the Picts and Caledonians, St. Andrew’s relics and\r\npanegyric, and the character and mission of the Apostles.\r\n\r\n“On Wednesday, at six or near the matter, take your chance, will be a\r\nmedley oration on the history, merits, and praise of confusion and of\r\nconfounders, in the road and out of the way.\r\n\r\n“On Friday will be that on Dr. Faustus and Fortunatus and conjuration.\r\nAfter each the Chimes of the Times, Nos. 23 and 24.”\r\n\r\nVery shortly afterwards he advertised from Clare Market:--\r\n\r\n1. “The postil will be on the turning of Lot’s wife into a pillar of salt.\r\n2. The sermon will be on the necessary power and attractive force which\r\nreligion gives the spirit of a man with God and good spirits.\r\n\r\n2. “At five--1. The postil will be on this point:--In what language our\r\nSaviour will speak the last sentence to mankind.\r\n\r\n3. “The lecture will be on Jesus Christ’s sitting at the right hand of\r\nGod; where that is; the honours and lustre of his inauguration; the\r\nlearning, criticism, and piety of that glorious article.\r\n\r\n“The Monday’s orations will shortly be resumed. On Wednesday the oration\r\nwill be on the skits of the fashions, or a live gallery of family pictures\r\nin all ages; ruffs, muffs, puffs manifold; shoes, wedding-shoes,\r\ntwo-shoes, slip-shoes, heels, clocks, pantofles, buskins, pantaloons,\r\ngarters, shoulder-knots, periwigs, head-dresses, modesties, tuckers,\r\nfarthingales, corkins, minnikins, slammakins, ruffles, round-robins, fans,\r\npatches; dame, forsooth, madam, my lady, the wit and beauty of my granmum;\r\nWinnifred, Joan, Bridget, compared with our Winny, Jenny, and Biddy: fine\r\nladies and pretty gentlewomen; being a general view of the _beau monde_\r\nfrom before Noah’s flood to the year ’29. On Friday will be something\r\nbetter than last Tuesday. After each a bob at the times.”\r\n\r\nThis very year, 1729, the _Dunciad_ was published, and in it this Rabelais\r\nof the pulpit had, of course, his niche. Pope had been accused of taking\r\nthe bread out of people’s mouths. He denies this, and asks if “Colley\r\n(Cibber) has not still his lord, and Henley his butchers;” and ends with\r\nthese lines, which, however, had no effect, for Henley went on ranting for\r\neighteen years longer--\r\n\r\n  “But where each science lifts its modern type,\r\n  History her pot, Divinity his pipe;\r\n  While proud Philosophy repines to show,\r\n  Dishonest sight! his breeches rent below,--\r\n  Imbrown’d with native bronze, lo! Henley stands,\r\n  Tuning his voice and balancing his hands.\r\n  How fluent nonsense trickles from his tongue!\r\n  How sweet the periods, neither said nor sung!\r\n  Still break the benches, Henley, with thy strain,\r\n  While Sherlock, Hare, and Gibson preach in vain.\r\n  O great restorer of the good old stage,\r\n  Preacher at once and zany of the age!\r\n  O worthy thou of Egypt’s wise abodes!\r\n  A decent priest when monkeys were the gods.\r\n  But Fate with butchers placed thy priestly stall,\r\n  Meek modern faith to murder, hack, and maul,\r\n  And bade thee live to crown Britannia’s praise\r\n  In Toland’s, Tindal’s, and in Woolston’s days.”[603]\r\n\r\nIn another place he says--\r\n\r\n  “Henley lay inspired beside a sink,\r\n  And to mere mortals seemed a priest in drink.”\r\n\r\nPope often attacked Henley in the _Grub Street Journal_, and the Orator\r\nretaliated. A year or two after the _Essay on Man_ was published, Henley\r\n(Dec. 1737) announced a lecture, “Whether Mr. Pope be a man of sense, in\r\none argument--‘Whatever is is right.’” If whatever is is right, Henley\r\nthought that nothing could be wrong; ergo, he himself was not a proper\r\nobject of satire.\r\n\r\nHenley’s pulpit was covered with velvet and gold lace, and over his altar\r\nwas written, “The PRIMITIVE Eucharist.” A contemporary journalist\r\ndescribes him entering his pulpit suddenly, like a harlequin, through a\r\nsort of trap-door at the back, and “at one large leap jumping into it and\r\nfalling to work,” beating his notions into the butcher-audience\r\nsimultaneously with his hands, arms, legs, and head.\r\n\r\nIn one of his arrogant puffs, he boasts that he has singly executed what\r\n“would sprain a dozen of modern doctors of the tribe of Issachar;” that no\r\none dares to answer his challenges; that he can write, read, and study\r\ntwelve hours a day and not feel the yoke; and write three dissertations a\r\nweek without help, and put the Church in danger. He struck medals for his\r\ntickets, with a star rising to the meridian upon them, and the vain\r\nsuperscription “Ad summa” (“To the heights”), and below, “Inveniam viam\r\naut faciam” (“I will find a way or make one”).\r\n\r\nWhen the Orator’s funds grew low, his audacity and impudence rose to their\r\nclimax. He once filled his chapel with shoemakers, whom he had attracted\r\nby advertising that he could teach a method of making shoes with wonderful\r\ncelerity. His secret consisted in cutting the tops off old boots. His\r\nmotto to this advertisement was “Omne majus continet in se minus” (“The\r\ngreater includes the less”).\r\n\r\nIn 1745 Henley was cited before the Privy Council for having used\r\nseditious expressions in one of his lectures. Herring, then Archbishop of\r\nYork, had been arming his clergy, and urging every one to volunteer\r\nagainst the Pretender. The Earl of Chesterfield, then Secretary of State,\r\nurged on Henley the impropriety of ridiculing such honest exertions at a\r\ntime when rebellion actually raged in the very heart of the kingdom. “I\r\nthought, my lord,” said Henley, “that there was no harm in cracking a joke\r\non a _red herring_.”\r\n\r\nDuring his examination, the restorer of ancient eloquence requested\r\npermission to sit, on account of a rheumatism that was generally supposed\r\nto be imaginary. The earl tried to turn the outlaw divine into ridicule;\r\nbut Henley’s eccentric answers, odd gestures, hearty laughs, strong voice,\r\nmagisterial air, and self-possessed face were a match for his somewhat\r\nheartless lordship.\r\n\r\nBeing cautioned about his disrespectful remarks on certain ministers,\r\nHenley answered gravely, “My lords, I must live.” Lord Chesterfield\r\nreplied, “I don’t see the necessity,” and the council laughed. Upon this\r\nHenley, remembering that the joke was Voltaire’s, was somewhat irritated.\r\n“That is a good thing, my lord,” he exclaimed, “but it has been said\r\nbefore.” A few days after the Orator, being reprimanded and cautioned, was\r\ndismissed as an impudent but entertaining fellow.[604]\r\n\r\nDr. Herring whom the rogue ridiculed was a worthy man, who in 1747, on the\r\ndeath of Potter, became Archbishop of Canterbury, and died in 1757. Swift\r\nhated Herring for condemning the “Beggars’ Opera” in a sermon at Lincoln’s\r\nInn, and wrote accordingly: “The ‘Beggars’ Opera’ will probably do more\r\ngood than a thousand sermons of so stupid, so injudicious, and so\r\nprostitute a divine.”[605]\r\n\r\nIn 1748 Dr. Cobden, the Court chaplain, an odd but worthy man, incurred\r\nthe resentment of King George II. by preaching before him a sermon\r\nentitled “A Persuasive to Chastity”--a virtue not popular then at St.\r\nJames’s. He resigned his post in 1752. The text of this obnoxious sermon\r\nwas, “Take away the wicked from before the king.” Henley’s next Saturday’s\r\nmotto was--\r\n\r\n  “Away with the wicked before the king,\r\n  Away with the wicked behind him;\r\n      His throne it will bless\r\n      With righteousness,\r\n  And we shall know where to find him.”\r\n\r\nIf any of the Orator’s old Bloomsbury friends ever caught his eye among\r\nthe audience, he would gratify his vanity and rankling resentment by a\r\npause. He would then say, “You see, sir, all mankind are not exactly of\r\nyour opinion; there are, you perceive, a few sensible persons in the world\r\nwho consider me as not totally unqualified for the office I have\r\nundertaken.” His abashed adversaries, hot and confused, and with all eyes\r\nturned on them, would retreat precipitately, and sometimes were pushed out\r\nof the room by Henley’s violent butchers.\r\n\r\nThe Orator figures in two caricatures, attributed, as Mr. Steevens thinks,\r\nwrongly to Hogarth. In one he is christening a child; in another he is on\r\na scaffold with a monkey by his side. A parson takes the money at the\r\ndoor, while a butcher is porter. Modesty is in a cloud, Folly in a coach,\r\nand there is a gibbet prepared for poor Merit.\r\n\r\nHenley, who latterly grew coarse, brutal, and drunken, died October 14,\r\n1756. The _Gentleman’s Magazine_ merely announces his death thus:--“Rev.\r\nOrator Henley, aged 64.” “Nollekens” Smith says that he died mad.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat uncertain where his Oratory stood: some say in Duke Street;\r\nothers, in the market. It was probably in Davenant’s old theatre, at the\r\nTennis Court in Vere Street.[606]\r\n\r\nThe beginning of one of this buffoon’s ribald sermons has been preserved,\r\nand is worth quoting to prove the miserable claptrap with which he amused\r\nhis rude audience. The text is taken from Jeremiah xvi. 16, “I will send\r\nfor many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after that\r\nI will send many hunters, and they shall hunt.”\r\n\r\n“The former part of the text seems, as Scripture is written for our\r\nadmonition, on whom the ends of the world are come (an end of all we have\r\nin the world), to relate to the _Dutch_, who are to be fished by us\r\naccording to Act of Parliament; for the word ‘herrings’ in the Act has a\r\nfigurative as well as a literal sense, and by a metaphor means Dutchmen,\r\nwho are the greatest stealers of herrings in the world; so that the drift\r\nof the statute is, that we are to fish for Dutchmen, and catch them,\r\neither by nets or fishing-rods in return for their repeated catching of\r\nEnglishmen, then transport them in some of Jonathan Forward’s close\r\nlighters and sell them in the West Indies, to repair the loss which our\r\nSouth Sea Company endure by the Spaniards denying them the assiento, or\r\nsale of negroes.”[607]\r\n\r\nAmong other wild sermons of Henley, we find discourses on “The Tears of\r\nMagdalen,” “St. Paul’s Cloak,” and “The Last Wills of the Patriarchs.” He\r\nleft behind him 600 MSS., which he valued at one guinea a-piece, and 150\r\nvolumes of commonplaces and other scholarly memoranda. They were sold for\r\nless than £100. They had been written with great care. When Henley was\r\nonce accused that he _did all_ for lucre, he retorted “that some do\r\nnothing for it.” He once filled his room by advertising an oration on\r\nmarriage. When he got into his pulpit he shook his head at the ladies, and\r\nsaid “he was afraid they oftener came to church to get husbands than to\r\nhear the preacher.” On one occasion two Oxonians whom he challenged came\r\nfollowed by such a strong party that the butchers were overawed, and\r\nHenley silently slunk away by a door behind the rostrum.[608]\r\n\r\nThere are still popular preachers in London as greedy of praise and as\r\nbasely eager for applause as Orator Henley. Equally great buffoons, and\r\nmen equally low in moral tone, still fill some pulpits, and point the way\r\nto a path they may never themselves take. To such unhappy self-deceivers\r\nwe can advise no better cure than a moonlight walk in Clare Market in\r\nsearch of the ghost of Orator Henley.\r\n\r\nThere was in Hogarth’s time an artists’ club at the Bull’s Head, Clare\r\nMarket. Boitard etched some of the characters. Hogarth, Jack Laguerre,\r\nColley Cibber, Denis the critic (?), Boitard, Spiller the comedian, and\r\nGeorge Lambert, were members. Laguerre gave Spiller’s portrait to the\r\nlandlord, and drew a caricature procession of his “chums.” The inn was\r\nafterwards called the “Spiller’s Head.” One of the wags of the club wrote\r\nan epitaph on Spiller, beginning--\r\n\r\n  “The butchers’ wives fall in hysteric fits,\r\n  For sure as they’re alive, poor Spiller’s dead;\r\n  But, thanks to Jack Laguerre, we’ve got his head.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  He was an inoffensive, merry fellow,\r\n  When sober hipped, blithe as a bird when mellow.”[609]\r\n\r\nThe Bull’s Head Tavern in Clare Market, the same place in which Hogarth’s\r\nclub was held, had previously been the favourite resort of that\r\nillustrious Jacobite, Dr. Radcliffe, who is said to have killed two\r\nqueens. Swift did not like this overbearing, ignorant, and surly humorist,\r\nwho, however, rejoiced in doing good, and left a vast sum of money to the\r\nUniversity of Oxford. When Bathurst, the head of Trinity College, asked\r\nRadcliffe where his library was, he pointed to a few vials, a skeleton,\r\nand a herbal, and replied, “There is Radcliffe’s library.”[610]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRURY LANE THEATRE, 1806.]\r\n\r\nMrs. Bracegirdle, that excellent and virtuous actress, used to be in the\r\nhabit (says Tony Ashton) of frequently going into Clare market and giving\r\nmoney to the poor unemployed basketwomen, insomuch that she could not pass\r\nthat neighbourhood without thankful acclamations from people of all\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 there were in and about Clare Market, about 26 butchers who\r\nslaughtered from 350 to 400 sheep weekly in the stalls and cellars. The\r\nnumber killed was from 50 to 60 weekly--but in winter sometimes as many as\r\n200. But the butchers’ market has now become almost a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nJoe Miller formerly lay buried in a graveyard on the south side of\r\nPortugal Street, but the graveyard is now turned to other purposes. At the\r\ncorner of Portugal Street and Lincoln’s Inn Fields is the “Black Jack”\r\nInn, a hostelry whose name is connected with some of Jack Sheppard’s\r\nfeats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD ST. GILES’S--CHURCH LANE AND DYOT STREET, 1869.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nST. GILES’S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat ancient Roman military road (the Watling Street) came from Edgeware,\r\nand passing over Hyde Park and through St. James’s Park by Old Palace\r\nYard, once the Wool Staple, it reached the Thames. Thence it was continued\r\nto Canterbury and the three great seaports.\r\n\r\nAnother Roman road, the _Via Trinobantica_, which began at Southampton and\r\nended at Aldborough, ran through London, crossed the Watling Street at\r\nTyburn, and passed along Oxford Street. In latter times, says Dr.\r\nStukeley, the road was changed to a more southerly direction, and Holborn\r\nwas formed, leading to Newgate or the Chamberlain’s Gate.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest tolls ever imposed in England is said to have had its\r\norigin in St. Giles’s.[611] In 1346 Edward III. granted to the Master of\r\nthe Hospital of St. Giles and to John de Holborne, a commission empowering\r\nthem to levy tolls for two years (one penny in the pound on their value)\r\non all cattle and merchandise passing along the public highways leading\r\nfrom the old Temple, _i.e._ Holborn Bars, to the Hospital of St. Giles’s,\r\nand also along the Charing Road and another highway called Portpool, now\r\nGray’s Inn Lane. The money was to be used in repairing the roads, which,\r\nby the frequent passing of carts, wains, horses, and cattle, had become so\r\nmiry and deep as to be nearly impassable. The only persons exempted were\r\nto be lords, ladies, and persons belonging to religious\r\nestablishments.[612]\r\n\r\nHenry V. ascended the throne in 1413, and astonished his subjects by\r\nsuddenly casting off his slough of vice, and becoming a self-restrained,\r\nvirtuous, and high-spirited king. His first care was to forget party\r\ndistinctions, and to put down the Lollards, or disciples of Wickliffe,\r\nwhom the clergy denounced as dangerous to the civil power. As a good\r\ngeneral secures the rear of his army before he advances, so the young king\r\nwas probably desirous to guard himself against this growing danger before\r\nhe invaded Normandy and made a clutch at the French crown.\r\n\r\nArundel, the primate, urged him to indict Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham,\r\nthe head of the Lollard sect. The king was averse to a prosecution, and\r\nsuggested milder means. At a conference, therefore, appointed before the\r\nbishops and doctors in 1414, the following articles were handed Oldcastle\r\nas tests, and the unorthodox lord was allowed two days to retract his\r\nheresies. He was required to confess that at the sacrament the material\r\nbread and wine are turned into Christ’s very body and Christ’s very\r\nblood; that every Christian man ought to confess to an ordained priest;\r\nthat Christ ordained St. Peter and his successors as his vicars on earth;\r\nthat Christian men ought to obey the priest; and that it is profitable to\r\ngo on pilgrimages and to worship the relics and images of saints. “This is\r\ndetermination of Holy Church. _How feel ye this article?_” With these\r\nstern words ended every dogma proposed by the primate.\r\n\r\nLord Cobham, who was much esteemed by the king, and had been a good\r\nsoldier under his father, repeatedly refused to profess his belief in\r\nthese tenets. The archbishop then delivered the heretic to the secular\r\narm, to be put to death, according to the usage of the times. The night\r\nprevious to his execution, however, Lord Cobham escaped from the Tower and\r\nfled to Wales, where he lay hid for four years while Agincourt was being\r\nfought, and where he must have longed to have been present with his true\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nSoon after his escape, the frightened clergy spread a report that he was\r\nin St. Giles’s Fields, at the head of twenty thousand Lollards, who were\r\nresolved to seize the king and his two brothers, the Dukes of Bedford and\r\nGloucester. For this imaginary plot thirty-six persons were hanged or\r\nburnt; but the names of only three are recorded, and of these Sir Roger\r\nActon is the only person of distinction.\r\n\r\nA reward of a thousand marks was offered for Lord Cobham, and other\r\ninducements were held out by Chicheley, the Primate Arundel’s successor.\r\nFour years, however, elapsed before the premature Protestant was\r\ndiscovered and taken by Lord Powis in Wales.[613] After some blows and\r\nblood a country-woman in the fray breaking Cobham’s leg with a stool, he\r\nwas secured and sent up to London in a horse-litter. He was sentenced to\r\nbe drawn on a hurdle to the gallows in St. Giles’s Fields, and to be\r\nhanged over a fire, in order to inflict on him the utmost pain.\r\n\r\nHe was brought from the Tower on the 25th of December 1418, and his arms\r\nbound behind him. He kept a very cheerful countenance as he was drawn to\r\nthe field where his assumed treason had been committed. When he reached\r\nthe gallows, he fell devoutly on his knees and piously prayed God to\r\nforgive his enemies. The cruel preparations for his torment struck no\r\nterror in him, nor shook the constancy of the martyr. He bore everything\r\nbravely as a soldier, and with the resignation of a Christian. Then he was\r\nhung by the middle with chains and consumed alive in the fire, praising\r\nGod’s name as long as his life lasted.\r\n\r\nHe was accused by his enemies of holding that there was no such thing as\r\nfree will; that all sin was inevitable; and that God could not have\r\nprevented Adam’s sin, nor have pardoned it without the satisfaction of\r\nChrist.[614]\r\n\r\nFuller says of him: “Stage-poets have themselves been very bold with, and\r\nothers very merry at, the memory of Sir John Oldcastle (Lord Cobham), whom\r\nthey have fancied a boon companion or jovial roysterer, and yet a coward\r\nto boot, contrary to the credit of the chronicles, owning him to be a\r\nmartial man of merit. Sir John Falstaff hath derided the memory of Sir\r\nJohn Oldcastle, and of late is substituted buffoon in his place; but it\r\nmatters us little what petulant priests or what malicious poets have\r\nwritten against him.”\r\n\r\nThe gallows had been removed from the Elms at Smithfield in 1413, the\r\nfirst year of Henry V.; but Tyburn was a place of execution as early as\r\n1388.[615] The St. Giles’s gallows was set up at the north corner of the\r\nhospital wall, between the termination of High Street and Crown Street,\r\nopposite to where the Pound stood.\r\n\r\nThe manor of St. Giles was anciently divided from Bloomsbury by a great\r\nfosse called Blemund’s Ditch. The Doomsday Book contains no mention of\r\nthis district, nor indeed of London at all, except of ten acres of land\r\nnigh Bishopsgate, belonging to St. Paul’s, and a vineyard in Holborn,\r\nbelonging to the Crown. This yard is supposed to have stood on the site of\r\nthe Vine Tavern (now destroyed), a little to the east of Kingsgate\r\nStreet.[616]\r\n\r\nBlemund’s Ditch was a line of defence running nearly parallel with the\r\nnorth side of Holborn, and connecting itself to the east with the Fleet\r\nbrook. It was probably of British origin.[617] On the north-west of\r\nLondon, in the Roman times, there were marshes and forests, and even as\r\nlate as Elizabeth, Marylebone and St. John’s Wood were almost all chase.\r\n\r\nThe manor was crown property in the Norman times, for Matilda, daughter of\r\nMalcolm king of Scotland and the queen of Henry I., built a leper hospital\r\nthere, and dedicated it to St. Giles. The same good woman erected a\r\nhospital at Cripplegate, and another at St. Katharine’s, near the Tower,\r\nand founded a priory within Aldgate. The hospital of St. Giles sheltered\r\nforty lepers, one clerk, a messenger, the master, and several matrons; the\r\nqueen gave 60s. a year to each leper. The inmates of lazar hospitals were\r\nin the habit of begging in the market-places.\r\n\r\nThe patron saint, St. Giles, was an Athenian of the seventh century, who\r\nlived as a hermit in a forest near Nismes. One day some hunters, pursuing\r\na hind that he had tamed, struck the Greek with an arrow as he protected\r\nit, but the good man still went on praying, and refused all recompense for\r\nthe injury. The French king in vain attempted to entice the saint from his\r\ncell, which in time, however, grew first into a monastery, and then into a\r\ntown.[618]\r\n\r\nThis hospital was built on the site of the old parish church, and it\r\noccupied eight acres. It stood a little to the west of the present church,\r\nwhere Lloyd’s Court stands or stood; and its gardens reached between High\r\nStreet and Hog Lane, now Crown Street, to the Pound, which used to stand\r\nnearly opposite to the west end of Meux’s Brewhouse. It was surrounded by\r\na triangular wall, running in a line with Crown Street to somewhere near\r\nthe Cock and Pye Fields (afterwards the Seven Dials), in a line with\r\nMonmouth Street, and thence east and west up High Street, joining near the\r\nPound.\r\n\r\nUnwholesome diet and the absence of linen seem to have encouraged\r\nleprosy, which was probably a disease of Eastern origin. In 1179 the\r\nLateran Council decreed that lepers should keep apart, and have churches\r\nand churchyards of their own. It was therefore natural to build hospitals\r\nfor lepers outside large towns. King Henry II., for the health of the\r\nsouls of his grandfather and grandmother, granted the poor lepers a second\r\n60s. each to be paid yearly at the feast of St. Michael, and 30s. more out\r\nof his Surrey rents to buy them lights. He also confirmed to them the\r\ngrant of a church at Feltham, near Hounslow. In Henry III.’s reign, Pope\r\nAlexander IV. issued a bull to confirm these privileges. Edward I. granted\r\nthe hospital two charters in 1300 and 1303; and in Edward II.’s reign so\r\nmany estates were granted to it that it became very rich. Edward III. made\r\nSt. Giles a cell of Burton St. Lazar in Leicestershire. This annexation\r\nled to quarrels, and to armed resistance against the visitations of Robert\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury. In this reign the great plague broke out, and\r\nthe king commanded the wards of the city to issue proclamations and remove\r\nall lepers. It is strange that St. Giles’s should have been the resort of\r\npariahs from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBurton St. Lazar (a manor sold in 1828 for £30,000) is still celebrated\r\nfor its cheeses. It remained a flourishing hospital from the reign of\r\nStephen till Henry VIII. suppressed it. St. Giles’s sank in importance\r\nafter this absorption, and finally fell in 1537 with its larger brother.\r\nBy a deed of exchange the greedy king obtained forty-eight acres of land,\r\nsome marshes, and two inns. Six years after the king gave St. Giles’s to\r\nJohn Dudley, Viscount Lisle, High Admiral of England, who fitted up the\r\nprincipal part of the hospital for his own residence. Two years after Lord\r\nLisle sold the manor to Wymond Carew, Esq. The mansion was situated\r\nwestward of the church and facing it. It was afterwards occupied by the\r\ncelebrated Alice, Duchess of Dudley, who died there in the reign of\r\nCharles II., aged ninety. This house was subsequently the residence of\r\nLord Wharton. It divided Lloyd’s Court from Denmark Street.\r\n\r\nThe master’s house, “The White House,” stood on the site of Dudley Court,\r\nand was given by the duchess to the parish as a rectory-house. The wall\r\nwhich surrounded the hospital gardens and orchards was not entirely\r\nremoved till 1639.\r\n\r\nEarly in the fourteenth century the parish of St. Giles, including the\r\nhospital inmates, numbered only one hundred inhabitants. In King John’s\r\nreign it was laid out in garden plots and cottages. In Henry III.’s reign\r\nit was a scattered country village, with a few shops and a stone cross,\r\nwhere the High Street now is. As far back as 1225 a blacksmith’s shop\r\nstood at the north-west end of Drury Lane, and remained there till its\r\nremoval in 1575.\r\n\r\nIn Queen Elizabeth’s reign the Holborn houses did not run farther than Red\r\nLion Street; the road was then open as far as the present Hart Street,\r\nwhere a garden wall commenced near Broad Street, St. Giles’s, and the end\r\nof Drury Lane, where a cluster of houses on the right formed the chief\r\npart of the village, the rest being scattered houses. The hospital\r\nprecincts were at this time surrounded by trees. Beyond this, north and\r\nsouth, all was country; and avenues of trees marked out the Oxford and\r\nother roads. There was no house from Broad Street, St. Giles’s, to Drury\r\nHouse at the top of Wych Street.[619]\r\n\r\nThe lower part of Holborn was paved in the reign of Henry VI., in 1417;\r\nand in 1542 (33d Henry VIII.) it was completed as far as St. Giles’s,\r\nbeing very full of pits and sloughs, and perilous and noisome to all on\r\nfoot or horseback. The first increase of buildings in this district was on\r\nthe north side of Broad Street. Three edicts of 1582, 1593, and 1602\r\nevince the alarm of Government at the increase of inhabitants and prohibit\r\nfurther building under severe penalties. The first proclamation, dated\r\nfrom Nonsuch Palace, in Surrey, assigns the reason of these\r\nprohibitions:--1. The difficulty of governing more people without new\r\nofficers and fresh jurisdictions. 2. The difficulty of supplying them with\r\nfood and fuel at reasonable rates. 3. The danger of plague and the injury\r\nto agriculture. Regulations were also issued to prevent the further\r\nresort of country people to town, and the lord mayor took oaths to enforce\r\nthese proclamations. But London burst through these foolish and petty\r\nrestraints as Samson burst the green withs. In 1580 the resident\r\nforeigners in the capital had increased from 3762 to 6462 persons, the\r\nmajority being Dutch who had fled from the Spaniards, and Huguenots who\r\nhad escaped from France after the massacre of St. Bartholomew. St. Giles’s\r\ngrew, especially to the east and west, round the hospital. The girdle wall\r\nwas mostly demolished soon after 1595. Holborn, stretching westward, with\r\nits fair houses, lodgings for gentlemen, and inns for travellers,[620] had\r\nnearly reached it. In Aggas’s map, cattle graze amid intersecting\r\nfootpaths, where Great Queen Street now is. There were then only two or\r\nthree houses in Covent Garden, but in 1606 the east side of Drury Lane was\r\nbuilt; in the assessment of 1623 upwards of twenty courtyards and alleys\r\nare mentioned; and 100 houses were added on the north side of St. Giles’s\r\nStreet, 136 in Bloomsbury, 56 on the west side of Drury Lane, and 71 on\r\nthe south side of Holborn.[621] The south and east sides of the hospital\r\nsite had been the slowest in their growth. After the Great Fire, these\r\nstill remained gardens, but the north side, nearer Oxford Road, was\r\nalready occupied. The first inhabitants of importance were Mr. Abraham\r\nSpeckart and Mr. Breads, in the reigns of James I. and Charles I., and\r\nafterwards Sir William Stiddolph. New Compton Street was originally called\r\nStiddolph Street, but afterwards changed its name when Charles II. gave\r\nthe adjoining marsh-land to Mr. Francis Compton, who built on the old\r\nhospital land a continuation of Old Compton Street. Monmouth Street,\r\nprobably named after the foolish and unfortunate duke, was also built in\r\nthis reign.\r\n\r\nIn 1694, in the reign of William III., a Mr. Neale, a lottery promoter,\r\ntook on lease the Cock and Pye Fields--then the resort of gambling boys,\r\nthieves, and beggars, and a sink of filth and cesspools--and built the\r\nneighbouring streets, placing in the centre a Doric pillar with seven\r\ndials on it; afterwards a clock was added.[622] This same Mr. Thomas Neale\r\ntook a large piece of ground on the north side of Piccadilly from Sir\r\nThomas Clarges, agreeing to lay out £10,000 in building; but he failed to\r\ncarry out his design, and Sir Walter Clarges, after great trouble, got the\r\nlease out of his hands, and Clarges Street was then built.[623]\r\n\r\nIn 1697 many hundreds of the 14,000 French refugees who fled from Louis\r\nXIV.’s dragoons after the cruel revocation of the Edict of Nantes settled\r\nabout Long Acre, the Seven Dials, and Soho. In Strype’s time (Queen Anne’s\r\nreign), Stacie Street, Kendrick Yard, Vinegar Yard, and Phoenix Street,\r\nwere mostly occupied by poor French people; indigent marquises and\r\nstarving countesses.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Anne, St. Giles’s increased with great rapidity--St.\r\nGiles’s Street and Broad Street from the Pound to Drury Lane, the\r\nsouth-east side of Tottenham Court Road, Crown Street, the Seven Dials,\r\nand Castle Street were completed; the south side of Holborn was also\r\nfinished from Broad Street to a little east of Great Turnstile, and, on\r\nthe north side, the street spread to two doors east of the Vine\r\nTavern.[624] The Irish had already begun to debase St. Giles’s; the French\r\nrefugees completed the degradation and hopelessness, and spread like a mud\r\ndeluge towards Soho.\r\n\r\nIn 1640 there are in the parish books several entries of money paid to\r\nsoldiers and distressed men who had lost everything they had in Ireland:--\r\n\r\n  Paid to a poor Irishman, and to a prisoner come\r\n  over from Dunkirk                                  £0 1 0\r\n\r\n  Paid for a shroud for an Irishman that died at\r\n  Brickils                                            0 2 6\r\n\r\nIn 1640, 1642, and 1647, there constantly occur donations to poor Irish\r\nministers and plundered Irish. Clothes were sent by the parish into\r\nIreland. There is one entry--\r\n\r\n  Paid to a poor gentleman undone by the burning of a city\r\n  in Ireland; having licence from the lords to collect      £0 3 0\r\n\r\nThe following entries are also curious and characteristic:--\r\n\r\n  1642.--To Mrs. Mabb, a poet’s wife, her husband being\r\n         dead                                             £0 1 0\r\n\r\n         Paid to Goody Parish, to buy her boys two\r\n         shirts; and Charles, their father, a waterman\r\n         at Chiswick, to keep him at £20 a\r\n         year from Christmas                              0  3 0\r\n\r\n  1648.--Gave to the Lady Pigot, in Lincoln’s Inn\r\n         Fields, poor and deserving relief                0  2 6\r\n\r\n  1670.--Given to the Lady Thornbury, being poor\r\n         and indigent                                     0 10 0\r\n\r\n  1641.--To old Goodman Street and old Goody\r\n         Malthus, very poor                               ------\r\n\r\n  1645.--To Mother Cole and Mother Johnson, xiid.\r\n         a-piece                                          0  2 0\r\n\r\n  1646.--To William Burnett, in a cellar in Raggedstaff\r\n         Yard, being poor and very sick                   0  1 6\r\n\r\n         To Goody Sherlock, in Maidenhead-fields\r\n         Lane, one linen-wheel, and gave her\r\n         money to buy flax                                0  1 0\r\n\r\nThere are also some interesting entries showing what a sink for the\r\npoverty of all the world the St. Giles’s cellars had become, even before\r\nthe Restoration.\r\n\r\n  1640.--Gave to Signor Lifecatha, a distressed\r\n         Grecian                                         ------\r\n\r\n  1642.--To Laylish Milchitaire, of Chimaica, in\r\n         Armenia, to pass him to his own country,\r\n         and to redeem his sons in slavery under\r\n         the Turks                                       £0  5 0\r\n\r\n  1654.--Paid towards the relief of the mariners,\r\n         maimed soldiers, widows and orphans of\r\n         such as have died in the service of Parliament   4 11 0\r\n\r\nThese were for Cromwell’s soldiers; and this year Oliver himself gave £40\r\nto the parish to buy coals for the poor.\r\n\r\n  1666.--Collected at several times towards the relief\r\n         of the poor sufferers burnt out by the late\r\n         dreadful fire of London                         £25 8 4\r\n\r\nIn 1670 nearly £185 was collected in this parish towards the redemption of\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nAfter 1648 the Irish are seldom mentioned by name. They had grown by this\r\ntime part and parcel of the district, and dragged all round them down to\r\npoverty. In 1653 an assistant beadle was appointed specially to search out\r\nand report all new arrivals of chargeable persons. In 1659 a monthly\r\nvestry-meeting was instituted to receive the constable’s report as to new\r\nvagrants.\r\n\r\nIn 1675 French refugees began to increase, and in 1679-1680, 1690 and 1692\r\nfresh efforts were made to search out and investigate the cases of all\r\nnew-comers. In 1710 the churchwardens reported to the commissioners for\r\nbuilding new churches, that “a great number of French Protestants were\r\ninhabitants of the parish.”\r\n\r\nWell-known beggars of the day are frequently mentioned in the parish\r\naccounts, as for instance--\r\n\r\n  1640.--Gave to Tottenham Court Meg, being very\r\n         sick                                              £0 1 0\r\n\r\n  1642.--Gave to the ballad-singing cobbler                 0 1 0\r\n\r\n  1646.--Gave to old Friz-wig                               1 6 0\r\n\r\n  1657.--Paid the collectors for a shroud for old Guy,\r\n         the poet                                           0 2 6\r\n\r\n  1658.--Paid a year’s rent for Mad Bess                    1 4 6\r\n\r\n  1642.--Paid to one Thomas, a traveller                    0 0 6\r\n\r\n         To a poor woman and her children, almost\r\n         starved                                            0 5 6\r\n\r\n  1645.--For a shroud for Hunter’s child, the blind\r\n         beggar-man                                         0 1 6\r\n\r\n  1646.--Paid and given to a poor wretch, name forgot       0 1 0\r\n\r\n         Given to old Osborn, a troublesome fellow          0 1 3\r\n\r\n         Paid to Rotton, the lame glazier, to carry\r\n         him towards Bath                                   0 3 0\r\n\r\n  1647.--To old Osborne and his blind wife                  0 0 6\r\n\r\n         To the old mud-wall maker                          0 0 6\r\n\r\nIn 1665 the plague fell heavily on St. Giles’s, already dirty and\r\novercrowded. The pest had already broken out five times within the eighty\r\nyears beginning in 1592; but no outbreak of this Oriental pest in London\r\nhad carried off more than 36,000 persons. The disease in 1665, however,\r\nslew no fewer than 97,306 in ten months.[625] In St. Giles’s the plague of\r\n1592 carried off 894 persons; in 1625 there died of the plague about 1333;\r\nbut in 1665 there were swept off from this parish alone 3216. The plague\r\nof 1625 seemed to have alarmed London quite as much as its successor, for\r\nwe find that in St. Giles’s no assessment could be made, as the richer\r\npeople had all fled into the country. A pest-house was fitted up in\r\nBloomsbury for the nine adjoining parishes, and this was afterwards taken\r\nby St. Giles’s for itself. The vestry appointed two examiners to inspect\r\ninfected houses. Mr. Pratt, the churchwarden, who advanced money to\r\nsuccour the poor when the rich deserted them, was afterwards paid forty\r\npounds for the sums he had generously disbursed at his own risk. In 1642\r\nthe entries in the parish books show that the disease had again become\r\nvirulent and threatening. The bodies were collected in carts by\r\ntorchlight, and thrown without burial service into large pits. Infected\r\nhouses were padlocked up, and watchmen placed to admit doctors or persons\r\nbringing food to the searchers, who at night brought out the dead.\r\n\r\nThe following entries (for 1642) in the parish books seem to me even more\r\nterrible than Defoe’s romance written fifty years after the events:--\r\n\r\n  Paid for the two padlocks and hasps for visited\r\n  houses                                           £0  2 6\r\n\r\n  Paid Mr. Hyde for candles for the bearers         0 10 0\r\n\r\n   \"   to the same for the night-cart and cover     7  9 0\r\n\r\n   \"   to Mr. Mann for links and candles for the\r\n       night-bearers                                0 10 0\r\n\r\nThe next year the plague still raged, and the same precautions seem to\r\nhave been taken as afterwards in 1665, showing that the terrible details\r\nof that punishment of filth and neglect were not new to London citizens.\r\n\r\nThe entries go on:--\r\n\r\n  To the bearers for carrying out of Crown Court a woman\r\n  that died of the plague                                   £0 1 6\r\n\r\n  Sent to a poor man shut up in Crown Yard of the plague     0 1 6\r\n\r\nThen follow sums paid for padlocks and staples, graves and links:--\r\n\r\n  Paid and given Mr. Lyn, the beadle, for a piece of good\r\n  service to the parish in conveying away of a visited\r\n  household to Lord’s Pest House, forth of Mr. Higgins’s\r\n  house at Bloomsbury                                      £0  1 6\r\n\r\n  Received of Mr. Hearle (Dr. Temple’s gift) to be given\r\n  to Mrs. Hockey, a minister’s widow, shut up in the\r\n  Crache Yard of the plague                                 0 10 0\r\n\r\nBut now came the awful pestilence of 1665; the streets were so deserted\r\nthat grass grew in them, and nothing was to be seen but coffins,\r\npest-carts, link-men, and red-crossed doors. The air resounded with the\r\ntolling of bells, the screams of distracted mourners crying from the\r\nwindows, “Pray for us!” and the dismal call of the searchers, “Bring out\r\nyour dead!”[626]\r\n\r\nThe plague broke out in its most malignant form among the poor of St.\r\nGiles’s;[627] and Dr. Hodges and Sir Richard Manningham, both first-rate\r\nauthorities on this subject, agree in this assertion.\r\n\r\nIn August 1665 an additional rate to the amount of £600 was levied.\r\nIndependent of this, very large sums were subscribed by persons resident\r\nin, or interested in, the parish. The following are a few of the items:--\r\n\r\n  Mr. Williams, from the Earl of Clare                £10  0  0\r\n\r\n  Mr. Justice (Sir Edmondbury) Godfrey, from the\r\n  Lord Treasurer                                       50  0  0\r\n\r\n  Earl Craven and the rest of the justices, towards\r\n  the visited poor, at various times                  449 16 10\r\n\r\n  Earl Craven towards the visited poor                 40  3  0\r\n\r\nThere are also these ominous entries:--\r\n\r\n  August.--Paid the searchers for viewing the corpse\r\n           of Goodwife Phillips, who died of the\r\n           plague                                        £0 0 6\r\n\r\n           Laid out for Goodman Phillips and his\r\n           children, being shut up and visited            0 5 0\r\n\r\n           Laid out for Lylla Lewis, 3 Crane Court,\r\n           being shut up of the plague; and laid\r\n           out for the nurse, and for the nurse and\r\n           burial                                        0 18 6\r\n\r\nIn July 1666 the constables, etc. were ordered to make an account of all\r\nnew inmates coming to the parish, and to take security that they would not\r\nbecome burdensome. They were also directed to be careful to prevent the\r\ninfection spreading for the future by a timely guard of all “that are or\r\nhereafter may happen to be visited.”\r\n\r\n“During the plague time,” says an eye-witness, “nobody put on black or\r\nformal mourning, yet London was all in tears. The shrieks of women and\r\nchildren at the doors and windows of their houses where their dearest\r\nrelations were dying, or perhaps dead, were enough to pierce the stoutest\r\nhearts. At the west end of the town it was a surprising thing to see those\r\nstreets which were usually thronged now grown desolate; so that I have\r\nsometimes gone the length of a whole street (I mean bye streets), and have\r\nseen nobody to direct me but watchmen[628] sitting at the doors of such\r\nhouses as were shut up; and one day I particularly observed that even in\r\nHolborn the people walked in the middle of the street, and not at the\r\nsides--not to mingle, as I supposed, with anybody that came out of\r\ninfected houses, or meet with smells and scents from them.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hodges, a great physician, who shunned no danger, describes even more\r\nvividly the horrors of that period. “In the streets,” he says, “might be\r\nseen persons seized with the sickness, staggering like drunken men; here\r\nlay some dozing and almost dead; there others were met fatigued with\r\nexcessive vomiting, as if they had drunk poison; in the midst of the\r\nmarket, persons in full health fell suddenly down as if the contagion was\r\nthere exposed to sale. It was not uncommon to see an inheritance pass to\r\nthree heirs within the space of four days. The bearers were not sufficient\r\nto inter the dead.”[629]\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that till the Leper Hospital was suppressed, the St.\r\nGiles’s people used the oratory there as their parish church. Leland does\r\nnot mention any other church, although he lived and wrote about the time\r\nof the suppression, and even made an effort to save the monastic MSS. by\r\nproposing to have them placed in the king’s library. The oratory had\r\nprobably a screen walling off the lepers from the rest of the\r\ncongregation. It boasted several chantry chapels, and a high altar at the\r\neast end, dedicated to St. Giles, before which burnt a great taper called\r\n“St. Giles’s light,” and towards which, about A.D. 1200, one William\r\nChristemas bequeathed an annual sum of twelvepence. There was also a\r\nChapel of St. Michael, appropriated to the infirm, and which had its own\r\nspecial priest.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles I. the south aisle of the hospital church was full\r\nof rubbish, lumber, and coffin-boards; and Lady Dudley put up a screen to\r\ndivide the nave from the chancel. In 1623 the church became so ruinous\r\nthat it had to be rebuilt at an expense of £2068: 7: 2. Among the\r\nsubscribers appear the names of the Duchess of Lennox, Sir Anthony\r\nAshleye, Sir John Cotton, and the players at “the Cockpit playhouse.” The\r\n415 householders of the parish subscribed £1065: 9s., the donations\r\nranging from the £250 of the Duchess of Dudley to Mother Parker’s\r\ntwopence.\r\n\r\nNearly five years elapsed before the new church was consecrated. On the\r\n9th of June 1628 Pym brought a charge against the rector, Dr. Mainwaring,\r\nfor having preached two obnoxious sermons, entitled “Religion” and\r\n“Allegiance,” and accused the imprudent time-server of persuading citizens\r\nto obey illegal commands on pain of damnation, and framing, like Guy Faux,\r\na mischievous plot to alter and subvert the Government.[630] The third\r\nsermon in which Mainwaring defended his two first, the stern Commons found\r\nupon inquiry[631] had been printed by special command of the king. It was\r\nas full of mischief as a bomb-shell. It held that on any exigency all\r\nproperty was transferred to the sovereign; that the consent of Parliament\r\nwas not necessary for the imposition of taxes; and that the divine laws\r\nrequired compliance with every demand which a prince should make upon his\r\nsubjects. For these doctrines the Commons impeached Mainwaring; the\r\nsentence pronounced on him was, that he should be imprisoned during the\r\npleasure of the House, that he should be fined £1000, to the king, make\r\nsubmission of his offence, be suspended from lay and ecclesiastical office\r\nfor three years, and that his sermons be called in and burnt.\r\n\r\nOn June 20 the courtly preacher came to the House, and on his knees\r\nsubmitted himself in sorrow and repentance for the errors and\r\nindiscretions he had been guilty of in preaching the sermons “rashly,\r\nscandalously, and unadvisedly.” He further acknowledged the three sermons\r\nto be full of dangerous passages and aspersions, and craved pardon for\r\nthem of God and the king. No sooner was the session over than the wilful\r\nking pardoned him, promoted him to the deanery of Winchester, and some\r\nyears after to the bishopric of St. David’s.[632]\r\n\r\nThe new church was consecrated on the 26th of January 1630. Bishop Laud\r\nperformed the ceremony, and was entertained at the house of a Mr.\r\nSpeckart, near the church. There were two tables sufficient to seat\r\nthirty-two persons. The broken churchyard wall was fenced up with boards,\r\nthe altar hung with green velvet, a rail made to keep the mob from the\r\nwest door, and a train of constables, armed with bills and halberts,\r\nappointed to maintain order if the Puritans became threatening. The new\r\nrector, Dr. Heywood, had been chaplain to Laud, and was probably of the\r\nHigh Church party. Like his expelled predecessor, he had been chaplain to\r\none of the most arbitrary of kings. In 1640 the Puritans, gaining\r\nstrength, petitioned Parliament against him, stating that he had set up\r\ncrucifixes and images of saints, likewise organs, “with other confused\r\nmusic, etc., hindering devotion and maintained at the great and needless\r\ncharge of the parish.” They described the carved screen as particularly\r\nobnoxious, and they objected to the altar rail, the chancel carpet, the\r\npurple velvet in the desk, the needlework covers of the books, the\r\ntapestry, the lawn cloth, the bone lace of the altar cloths, and the\r\ntaffeta curtains on the walls. These “popish and superstitious” ornaments\r\nwere sold by order of Parliament, all but the plate and the great bell.\r\nThe surplices were given away. The twelve apostles were washed off the\r\norgan-loft, and the painted glass was taken down from the windows. The\r\nscreen was sold for forty shillings, and the money given to the poor. The\r\nCovenant was framed and hung up in the church, and five shillings given to\r\na pewterer for a new basin cut square on one side for baptisms. The blue\r\nvelvet carpet, embroidered cushions, and blue curtains were sold, and so\r\nwere the communion rails. In 1647 Lady Dudley’s pew was lined with green\r\nbaize and supplied with two straw mats. In 1650 the king’s arms were taken\r\nout of the windows, and a sun-dial was substituted. The organ-loft was let\r\nas a pew.\r\n\r\nThe Restoration soon followed on these paltry excesses of a low-bred\r\nfanaticism. The ringers of St. Giles’s rang a peal for three days running.\r\nThe king’s arms in the vestry and the windows were restored. Galleries\r\nwere erected for the nobility. In 1670 a brass chandelier of sixteen\r\nbranches was bought for the church, and an hour-glass for the pulpit.\r\n\r\nIn 1718 the old hospital church had become damp and unwholesome. The\r\ngrave-ground had risen eight feet, so that the church lay in a pit.\r\nParliament was therefore petitioned that St. Giles’s should be one of the\r\nfifty new churches. It was urged that a good church facing the High\r\nStreet, the chief thoroughfare for all persons who travelled the Oxford\r\nor Hampstead roads, would be a great ornament. The petitioners also\r\ncontended that St. Giles’s already spent £5300 a year on the poor, and\r\nthat a new rate would impoverish many industrious persons. The Duke of\r\nNewcastle, the Lord Chancellor, and other eminent parishioners strenuously\r\nsupported the petition, which, on the other hand, was warmly opposed by\r\nthe Archbishop of York, five bishops, and eleven temporal peers. The\r\nopposition contended that the parish was well able to repair the present\r\nchurch; that the fund given for building new churches was never meant to\r\nbe devoted to rebuilding old ones; and that so far from the parish not\r\nrequiring church accommodation, St. Giles’s contained 40,000 persons, a\r\nnumber for which three new churches would be barely sufficient.[633]\r\nEleven years longer the church remained a ruin, when in 1729 the\r\ncommissioners granted £8000 for a new church, provided that the parish\r\nwould settle £350 a year on the rector of the new parish of Bloomsbury.\r\n\r\nThe architect of the new church, opened in 1734, was Henry Flitcroft. The\r\nroof is supported by Ionic pillars of Portland stone. The steeple is 160\r\nfeet high, and consists of a rustic pedestal supporting Doric pilasters;\r\nover the clock is an octangular tower, with three-quarter Ionic columns\r\nsupporting a balustrade with vases. The spire is octangular and belled.\r\nThis hideous production of Greek rules was much praised by the critics of\r\n1736. They called it “simple and elegant.” They considered the east end as\r\n“pleasing and majestic,” and found nothing in the west to object to but\r\nthe smallness and poverty of the doors. The steeple they described as\r\n“light, airy, and genteel.”[634] whether taken with the body of the church\r\nor considered as a _separate building_.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 the clock of St. Giles’s Church was illuminated with gas, and the\r\nnovelty and utility of the plan “attracted crowds to visit it from the\r\nremotest parts of the metropolis.”[635]\r\n\r\nSt. Giles’s Churchyard was enlarged in 1628, and again soon after the\r\nRestoration. The garden plot from which the new part was divided was\r\ncalled Brown’s Gardens. In 1670 we find the sexton agreeing, on condition\r\nof certain windows he had been allowed to introduce into the side of his\r\nhouse, facing the churchyard, to furnish the rector and churchwardens,\r\nevery Tuesday se’nnight after Easter, with two fat capons ready dressed.\r\n\r\nIn 1687 the Resurrection Gate, or Lich Gate, as it was called, and which\r\nstill exists, was erected at a cost of £185: 14: 6. It stood for many\r\nyears farther to the west than the old gate, and contains a heap of\r\ndully-carved figures in relievo, abridged from Michael Angelo’s “Last\r\nJudgment,” and crowded under a large “compass pediment.” It has lately,\r\nhowever, been replaced in its old position. This work was much admired and\r\ncelebrated, but “Nollekens” Smith says that it is poor stuff.\r\n\r\nPennant, always shrewd and vivacious, was one of the first writers who\r\nexposed the disgraceful and dangerous condition of the London churchyards.\r\nHe describes seeing at St Giles’s a great square pit with rows of coffins\r\npiled one upon the other, exposed to sight and smell, awaiting the\r\nmortality of the night. “I turned away,” he says, “disgusted at the scene,\r\nand scandalised at the want of police which so little regards the health\r\nof the living as to permit so many putrid corpses, packed between some\r\nslight boards, dispersing their dangerous effluvia over the capital.”[636]\r\n\r\nIn 1808 a new burial-ground for St. Giles’s parish was consecrated in St.\r\nPancras’s. It stands in grim loneliness between the Hampstead Road and\r\nCollege Street, Camden Town.\r\n\r\nThe graves of John Flaxman, the sculptor, and his wife and sister, are\r\nmarked by an altar tomb of brick, surmounted by a thick slab of Portland\r\nstone. Near it is the ruinous tomb of ingenious, faddling Sir John Soane,\r\nthe architect to the Bank of England. It is a work of great pretension,\r\n“but cut up into toy-shop prettiness, with all the peculiar defects of\r\nhis style and manner.” Two black cypresses mark the grave.[637]\r\n\r\nA few eminent persons are buried in the old St. Giles’s Churchyard.\r\nAmongst these, the most illustrious is George Chapman, who produced a fine\r\nthough rugged translation of the _Iliad_ which is to Pope’s what heart of\r\noak is to veneer, and who died in 1634 aged seventy-seven, and lies buried\r\nhere. Inigo Jones generously erected an altar tomb to his memory at his\r\nown expense; it is still to be seen in the external southern wall of the\r\nchurch. The monument is old; but the inscription is only a copy of all\r\nthat remained visible of the old writing. That chivalrous visionary, Lord\r\nHerbert of Cherbury, was also buried here, and so was James Shirley, the\r\ndramatist, who died in 1666. The latter was the last of the great\r\nante-Restoration play-writers, and of a thinner fibre than any of the\r\nrest, except melancholy Ford.\r\n\r\nRichard Pendrell, the Staffordshire farmer, “the preserver and conductor\r\nof King Charles II. after his escape from Worcester Fight,” has an altar\r\ntomb to his memory raised in this churchyard. After the Restoration,\r\nRichard came to town, to be in the way, I suppose, of the good things then\r\nfalling into Cavaliers’ mouths, and probably settled in St. Giles’s to be\r\nnear the Court. The story of the Boscobel oak was one with which the\r\nswarthy king delighted to buttonhole his courtiers. Pendrell died in 1671,\r\nand had a monument erected to his memory on the south-east side of the\r\nchurch. The black marble slab of the old tomb forms the base of the\r\npresent one. The epitaph is in a strain of fulsome bombast, considering\r\nthe king who was preserved showed his gratitude to Heaven only by a long\r\ncareer of unblushing vice, and by impoverishing and disgracing the foolish\r\ncountry that called him home. It begins thus:--\r\n\r\n  “Hold, passenger! here’s shrouded in this hearse\r\n  Unparalleled Pendrell thro’ the universe.\r\n  Like when the eastern star from heaven gave light\r\n  To three lost kings, so he in such dark night\r\n  To Britain’s monarch, lost by adverse war,\r\n  On earth appeared a second eastern star.”\r\n\r\nThe dismal poet ends by assuring the world that Pendrell, the king’s\r\npilot, had gone to heaven to be rewarded for his good steering. In 1702 a\r\nPendrell was overseer in this parish. About 1827 a granddaughter of this\r\nRichard lived near Covent Garden, and still enjoyed part of the family\r\npension. In 1827 Mr. John Pendrell, another descendant of Richard, died at\r\nEastbourne.[638] His son kept an inn at Lewes, and was afterwards clerk at\r\na Brighton hotel.\r\n\r\nThe only monument at present of interest in the church is a recumbent\r\nfigure of the Duchess Dudley, the great benefactor of the parish, created\r\na duchess in her own right by Charles I. She died 1669. The monument was\r\npreserved by parochial gratitude when the church was rebuilt, in\r\nconsideration of the duchess’s numerous bequests to the parish. She was\r\nburied at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire. This pious and charitable lady was\r\nthe daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh, and she married Sir Robert\r\nDudley, son of the great Earl of Leicester, who deserted her and his five\r\ndaughters, and went and settled in Florence, where he became chamberlain\r\nto the Grand Duchess. Clever and unprincipled as his father, Sir Robert\r\ndevised plans for draining the country round Pisa, and improving the port\r\nof Leghorn. He was outlawed, and his estates at Kenilworth, etc. were\r\nconfiscated and sold for a small sum to Prince Henry; but Charles I.\r\ngenerously gave them back to the duchess.\r\n\r\nIn her funeral sermon, Dr. Boreman says of this good woman: “She was a\r\nmagazine of experience.... I have often said she was a living chronicle\r\nbound up with the thread of a long-spun age. And in divers incidents and\r\nthings relating to our parish, I have often appealed to her stupendous\r\nmemory as to an ancient record.... In short, I would say to any desirous\r\nto attain some degree of perfection, ‘Vade ad Sancti Egidii oppidum, et\r\ndisce Ducinam Dudleyam’--(‘Come to St. Giles, and inquire the character of\r\nLady Dudley’).”[639]\r\n\r\nThe oldest monument remaining in the churchyard in 1708 was dated 1611. It\r\nwas a tombstone, “close to the wall on the south side, and near the west\r\nend,” and was to the memory of a Mrs. Thornton.[640] Her husband was the\r\nbuilder of Thornton Alley, which was probably his estate. The following\r\npainful lines were round the margin of the stone:--\r\n\r\n  “Full south this stone four foot doth lie\r\n  His father John and grandsire Henry\r\n  Thornton, of Thornton, in Yorkshire bred,\r\n  Where lives the fame of Thornton’s being dead.”\r\n\r\nAgainst the east end of the north aisle of the church was the tombstone of\r\nEleanor Steward, who died 1725, aged 123 years and five months.\r\n\r\nThat good and inflexible patriot, Andrew Marvell, the most poignant\r\nsatirist of King Charles II., died in 1678, and is buried in St. Giles’s.\r\nMarvell was Latin secretary to Milton, and in the school of that good\r\nman’s house learnt how a true patriot should live. It is recorded that one\r\nday when he was dining in Maiden Lane, one of Charles II.’s courtiers came\r\nto offer him £1000 as a bribe for his silence. Marvell refused the gift,\r\ntook off the dish-cover, and showed his visitor the humble half-picked\r\nmutton-bone on which he was about to dine. He was member for\r\nKingston-upon-Hull for nearly twenty years, and was buried at last at the\r\nexpense of his constituents. They also voted a sum of money to erect a\r\nmonument to him with a harmless epitaph; to this, however, the rector of\r\nthe time, to his own disgrace, refused admittance. Thompson, the editor of\r\nMarvell’s works, searched in vain in 1774 for the patriot’s coffin. He\r\ncould find no plate earlier than 1722.\r\n\r\nIn the same church with this fixed star rests that comet, Sir Roger\r\nl’Estrange. His monument was said to be the grandest in the church. Sir\r\nRoger died in 1704, aged eighty-eight.\r\n\r\nIn 1721, after an ineffectual treaty for Dudley Court, where the\r\nparsonage-house had once stood, a piece of ground called Vinegar Yard was\r\npurchased for the sum of £2252: 10s. as a burial-ground, hospital, and\r\nworkhouse for the parish of St. Giles’s. At that time St. Giles’s relieved\r\nabout 840 persons, at the cost of £4000 a year. Of this number there were\r\n162 over seventy years of age, 126 parents overburthened with children,\r\n183 deserted children and orphans, 70 sick at parish nurses’, and 300 men\r\nlame, blind, and mad.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Southampton granted land for five almshouses in St. Giles’s in\r\n1656.[641] The site was in Broad Street, nearly at the north end of\r\nMonmouth and King Streets, where they stood until 1782, at which period\r\nthey were pulled down to widen the road. The new almshouses were erected\r\nin a close, low, and unhealthy spot in Lewknor’s Lane.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1661 Mr. William Shelton left lands for a school for fifty\r\nchildren in Parker’s Lane, between Drury Lane and Little Queen Street. The\r\ntenements, before he bought them, had been in the occupation of the Dutch\r\nambassador. The premises were poor houses, and a coach-house and stables\r\nin the occupation of Lord Halifax. In 1687, the funds proving inadequate,\r\nthe school was discontinued; but in 1815, after being in abeyance for\r\nfifty-three years, it was re-opened in Lloyd’s Court.[642]\r\n\r\nThe select vestry of St. Giles’s was much badgered in 1828 by the excluded\r\nparishioners. There were endless errors in the accounts, and items\r\namounting to £90,000 were found entered only in pencil. The special pleas\r\nput in by the attorneys of the vestry covered 175 folios of writing.\r\n\r\nHog Lane, built in 1680, was rechristened in 1762 Crown Street, as an\r\ninscription on a stone let into the wall of a house at the corner of Rose\r\nStreet intimates.[643] Strype calls it a “place not over well built or\r\ninhabited.” The Greeks had a church here, afterwards a French refugee\r\nplace of worship, and subsequently an Independent chapel. It stood on the\r\nwest side of the lane, a few doors from Compton Street; and its site is\r\nnow occupied by St. Mary’s Church and clergy-house. Hogarth laid the scene\r\nof his “Noon” in Hog Lane, at the door of this chapel; but the houses\r\nbeing reversed in the engraving, the truth of the picture is destroyed.\r\nThe background contains a view of St. Giles’s Church. The painter\r\ndelighted in ridiculing the fantastic airs of the poor French gentry, and\r\nshowed no kindly sympathy with their honest poverty and their sufferings.\r\nIt was to St. Giles’s that Hogarth came to study poverty and also vice. A\r\nscene of his “Harlot’s Progress” is in Drury Lane, close by. Tom Nero, in\r\nthe “Four Stages of Cruelty,” is a St. Giles’s charity-boy, and we see him\r\nin the first stage tormenting a dog near the church. Hogarth’s “Gin\r\nStreet” is situated in St. Giles’s. The scenes of all the most hideous and\r\npainful of his works are in this district.\r\n\r\n“Nollekens” Smith, writing of St. Giles’s, says: “I recollect the building\r\nof most of the houses at the north end of New Compton Street--so named in\r\ncompliment to Bishop Compton, Dean of St. Paul’s. I also remember a row of\r\nsix small almshouses, surrounded by a dwarf brick wall, standing in the\r\nmiddle of High Street. On the left hand of High Street, passing into\r\nTottenham Court Road, there were four handsome brick houses, probably of\r\nQueen Anne’s time, with grotesque masks as keystones to the first-floor\r\nwindows. Nearly on the site of the new “Resurrection Gate,” in which the\r\nbasso-relievo is, stood a very small old house towards Denmark Street,\r\nwhich used to totter, to the terror of passers by, whenever a heavy\r\ncarriage rolled through the street.”[644]\r\n\r\nExactly where Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road meet in a right\r\nangle, a large circular boundary-stone was let into the pavement. Here\r\nwhen the charity-boys of St. Giles’s walked the boundaries, those who\r\ndeserved flogging were whipped, in order to impress the parish frontier on\r\ntheir memories.\r\n\r\nThe Pound originally stood in the middle of the High Street, whence it was\r\nremoved in 1656 to make way for the almshouses. It had stood there when\r\nthe village really required a place to imprison straying cattle. The\r\nlatest pound stood in the broad space where the High Street, Tottenham\r\nCourt Road, and Oxford Street meet; it occupied a space of about\r\nthirty-feet, and was removed in 1768. It must have faced Meux’s Brewery.\r\nAn old song that celebrates this locality begins--\r\n\r\n  “At Newgate steps Jack Chance was found,\r\n  And bred up near St. Giles’s Pound.”\r\n\r\nCriminals on their way to Tyburn used to “halt at the great gate of St.\r\nGiles’s Hospital, where a bowl of ale was provided as their last\r\nrefreshment in this life.”[645] A similar custom prevailed at York, which\r\ngave rise to the proverb, “The saddler of Bawtry was hung for leaving his\r\nliquor,” meaning that if the impatient man had stopped to drink, his\r\nreprieve would have arrived in time.[646]\r\n\r\nBowl Yard was built about 1623, and was then surrounded by gardens. It is\r\na narrow court on the south side of High Street, over against Dyot Street,\r\nnow George Street. There was probably here a public-house, the Bowl, at\r\nwhich in later time ale was handed to the passing thieves.\r\n\r\nSwift, in a spirited ballad describes “clever Tom Clinch,” who rode\r\n“stately through Holborn to die in his calling,” stopping at the George\r\nfor a bottle of sack, and promising to pay for it “_when he came back_.”\r\nNo one has sketched the highwayman more perfectly than the Irish prelate.\r\nTom Clinch wears waistcoat, stockings, and breeches of white, and his cap\r\nis tied with cherry ribbon. He bows like a beau at the theatre to the\r\nladies in the doors and to the maids in the balconies, who cry, “Lackaday,\r\nhe’s a proper young man.” He swears at the hawkers crying his last speech,\r\nkicks the hangman when he kneels to ask his pardon, makes a short speech\r\nexhorting his comrades to ply their calling, and so carelessly and\r\ndefiantly takes his leave of an ungrateful world.\r\n\r\n“Rainy Day” Smith describes,[647] when a boy of eight years old, being\r\ntaken by Nollekens, the sculptor, to see that notorious highwayman John\r\nRann, alias “Sixteen-string Jack,” on his way to execution at Tyburn, for\r\nrobbing Dr. Bell, chaplain to the Princess Amelia, in Gunnersbury Lane,\r\nnear Brentford, in 1774. Rann was a smart fellow, and had been a coachman\r\nto Lord Sandwich, who then lived at the south-east corner of Bedford Row,\r\nCovent Garden. The undaunted malefactor wore a bright pea-green coat, and\r\ncarried an immense nosegay, which some mistress of the highwayman had\r\nhanded him, according to custom, as a last token, from the steps of St.\r\nSepulchre’s Church. The sixteen strings worn by this freebooter at his\r\nknees were reported to be in ironical allusion to the number of times he\r\nhad been acquitted. On their return home, Nollekens, stooping to the boy’s\r\near, assured him that had his father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, been then\r\nHigh Constable, they could have walked all the way to Tyburn beside the\r\ncart.[648]\r\n\r\nHolborn used to be called “the Heavy Hill” because it led thieves from\r\nNewgate to Tyburn. Old fat Ursula, the roast-pig seller in Ben Jonson’s\r\n_Bartholomew Fair_ talks of ambling afoot to hear Knockhem the footpad\r\ngroan out of a cart up the Heavy Hill. This was in James I.’s time. Dryden\r\nalludes to it in the same way in 1678,[649] and in 1695 Congreve’s Sir\r\nSampson[650] mentions the same doleful procession. In 1709 (Queen Anne)\r\nTom Browne mentions a wily old counsellor in Holborn who used to turn out\r\nhis clerks every execution day for a profitable holiday, saying, “Go, you\r\nyoung rogues, go to school and improve.”\r\n\r\nSt. Giles’s was always famous for its inns.[651] One of the oldest of\r\nthese was the Croche House, or Croche Hose (Cross Hose), so called from\r\nits sign--the Crossed Stockings. The sign, still used by hosiers, was a\r\nred and white stocking forming a St. Andrew’s Cross. This inn belonged to\r\nthe hospital cook in 1300, and was given by him to the hospital. It stood\r\nat the north of the present entrance to Compton Street, and was probably\r\ndestroyed before the reign of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Swan on the Hop was an inn of Edward III.’s time; it stood eastward of\r\nDrury Lane and on the south side of Holborn.[652]\r\n\r\nThe White Hart is described in Henry VIII.’s time as possessing eighteen\r\nacres of pasture. It stood near the Holborn end of Drury Lane, and existed\r\ntill 1720. In Aggas’s Plan it appears surrounded on three sides by a wall.\r\nIt was bounded on the east by Little Queen Street, and was divided from\r\nHolborn by an embankment. A court afterwards stood on its site.\r\n\r\nThe Rose is mentioned as early as Edward III.’s reign. It was near\r\nLewknor’s Lane, and stood not far from the White Hart.\r\n\r\nThe Vine was an inn till 1816. It was on the north side of Holborn, a\r\nlittle to the east of Kingsgate Street. It is supposed to have stood on\r\nthe site of a vineyard mentioned in Doomsday Book. It was originally a\r\ncountry roadside inn, with fields at the back. It became an infamous\r\nnuisance. The house that replaced it was first occupied by a\r\ntimber-merchant, and afterwards by Probert, the accomplice of Thurtell,\r\nwho, escaping death for the murder of Mr. Weare, was soon after hanged for\r\nhorse-stealing in Gloucestershire. It was at this trial that the\r\nprisoner’s keeping a gig was adduced as an incontestible proof of his\r\nrespectability--a fact immortalised, almost to the weariness of a\r\ndegenerate age, by Mr. Thomas Carlyle. The inn was once called the\r\nKingsgate Tavern, from its having stood near the king’s gate or turnpike\r\nin the adjoining street.\r\n\r\nThe Cock and Pye Inn stood at the west corner of what was once a mere or\r\nmarshland. The fields surrounding it, now Seven Dials, were called from\r\nit the Cock and Pye Fields.\r\n\r\nThe Maidenhead Inn stood in Dyot Street, and formed part of Lord\r\nMountjoy’s estates in Elizabeth’s time. It was the house for parish\r\nmeetings in Charles II.’s reign. It then became a resort for mealmen and\r\nfarmers, and latterly a brandy-shop and beggars’ haunt of the vilest sort.\r\nIt was finally turned into a stoneyard. Dyot Street, so called after Sir\r\nJohn Dyot, who left it by wish to the poor, though it was afterwards a\r\npoor and even dangerous locality, must have been respectable in 1662, when\r\na Presbyterian chapel was built there for Joseph Read, Baxter’s friend, an\r\nejected minister from Worcestershire. Read was taken up under the\r\nConventicles Act in 1677, and endured much persecution, but was restored\r\nto his congregation on the accession of James II. From 1684 to 1708 the\r\nbuilding was used as a chapel of ease to St. Giles’s Church. At the close\r\nof the last century men would hurry along Dyot Street as through a\r\ndangerous defile. There was a legend current of a banker’s clerk who,\r\nreturning from his round, with his book of notes and bills fastened by the\r\nusual chain, as he passed down Dyot Street felt a cellar door sinking\r\nunder him. Conscious of his danger, he made a spring forward, dashed down\r\nthe street, and escaped the trap set for him by the thieves. It may be\r\nadded that Dyot Street gave the name to a song sung by Liston in the\r\nadmirable burlesque of “Bombastes Furioso.”\r\n\r\nIrish mendicants--the poorest, dirtiest, and most unimprovable of all\r\nbeggars--began to crowd into St. Giles’s about the time of Queen\r\nElizabeth.[653]\r\n\r\nThe increase of London soon attracted country artisans and country\r\nbeggars. The closing of the monasteries had filled England with herds of\r\nsturdy and dangerous vagrants not willing to work, and by no means\r\ninclined to starve. The new-comers resorting to the suburbs of London to\r\nescape the penalties of infringing the City jurisdiction, the\r\nstout-hearted queen ordered all persons within three miles of London\r\ngates to forbear from allowing any house to be occupied by more than one\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nA proclamation of 1583 alludes to the very poor and the beggars, who lived\r\n“heaped up” in small tenements and let lodgings. A subsequent warning\r\norders the suppression of the great multitude of Irish vagrants, many of\r\nwhom haunted the courts under pretence of suits; by day they mixed with\r\ndisbanded soldiers from the Low Countries and other impostors and beggars,\r\nand at night committed robberies and outrages. St. Giles’s was then one of\r\nthe great harbours for these “misdemeaned persons.” On one occasion a mob\r\nof these rogues surrounded the queen as she was riding out in the evening\r\nto Islington to take the air. That same night Fleetwood, the Recorder,\r\nissued warrants, and in the morning went out himself and took seventy-four\r\nrogues, including some blind rich usurers, who were all sent to Bridewell\r\nfor speedy punishment.\r\n\r\nJames I. pursued the same crusade against vagrants, forbidding new\r\nbuildings in the suburbs, and ordering all newly raised structures to be\r\npulled down. The beadles had to attend every Sunday at the vestry to\r\nreport all new inmates, and who lodged them, and to take up all idlers;\r\nthe constables in 1630 were also required to give notice of such persons\r\nto the churchwardens every month. In an entry in St. Giles’s parish books\r\nin 1637 “families in cellars” are first mentioned.[654] The locality\r\nafterwards became noted for these dens, and “a cellar in St. Giles’s”\r\nbecame a proverbial phrase to signify the lowest poverty.\r\n\r\nIn 1640 Irishmen are first mentioned by name, and money was paid to take\r\nthem back again to their native land.\r\n\r\nSir John Fielding, brother of the great novelist, who was an active\r\nWestminster magistrate in his time and a great hunter down of highwaymen,\r\nin a pamphlet on the increase of crime in London, lays special stress on\r\nthe vicious poverty of St. Giles’s. He gives a statement on the authority\r\nof Mr. Welch, the High Constable of Holborn, of the overcrowding of the\r\nmiserable lodgings where idle persons and vagabonds were sheltered for\r\ntwopence a night. One woman alone owned seven of these houses, which were\r\ncrowded with twopenny beds from cellar to garret. In these beds both\r\nsexes, strangers or not, lay promiscuously, the double bed being a\r\nhalfpenny cheaper. To still more wed vice to poverty, these lodging-house\r\nkeepers sold gin at a penny a quartern, so that no beggar was so poor that\r\nhe could not get drunk. No fewer than seventy of these vile houses were\r\nfound open at all hours, and in one alone, and not the largest, there were\r\ncounted fifty-eight persons sleeping in an atmosphere loathsome if not\r\nactually poisonous.\r\n\r\nThis Judge Welch was the father of Mrs. Nollekens, and a brave and\r\nbenevolent man. He was a friend of Dr. Johnson and of Fielding, whom he\r\nsucceeded in his justiceship, Mr. Welch having on one occasion heard that\r\na notorious highwayman who infested the Marylebone lanes was sleeping in\r\nthe first floor of a house in Rose Street, Long Acre, he hired the tallest\r\nhackney-coach he could find, drove under the thief’s window, ascended the\r\nroof, threw up the sash, entered the room, actually dragged the fellow\r\nnaked out of bed on to the roof of the coach, and in that way carried him\r\ndown New Street and up St. Martin’s Lane, amidst the huzzas of an immense\r\nthrong which followed him, to Litchfield Street, Soho.[655]\r\n\r\nArchenholz, the German traveller, writing circa 1784, describes the\r\nstreets of London as crowded with beggars. “These idle people,” says this\r\ncurious observer, “receive in alms three, four, and even five shillings a\r\nday. They have their clubs in the parish of St. Giles’s, where they meet,\r\ndrink and feed well, read the papers, and talk politics. One of my friends\r\nput on one day a ragged coat, and promised a handsome reward to a beggar\r\nto introduce him to his club. He found the beggars gay and familiar, and\r\npoor only in their rags. One threw down his crutch, another untied a\r\nwooden leg, a third took off a grey wig or removed a plaister from a sound\r\neye; then they related their adventures, and planned fresh schemes. The\r\nfemale beggars hire children for sixpence and sometimes even two\r\nshillings a day: a very deformed child is worth four shillings.” In the\r\nsame parish the pickpockets met to dine and exchange or sell snuff-boxes,\r\nhandkerchiefs, and other stolen property.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years before, says Archenholz, there had been a pickpockets’\r\nclub in St. Giles’s, where the knives and forks were chained to the table\r\nand the cloth was nailed on. Rules were, however, decorously observed, and\r\nchairmen chosen at their meetings. Not far from this house was a\r\ncelebrated gin-shop, on the sign-post of which was written, “Here you may\r\nget drunk for a penny, dead drunk for twopence, and straw for nothing.”\r\nThe cellars of this public-spirited man were never empty.\r\n\r\nArchenholz also sketches the conjurors who told fortunes for a shilling.\r\nThey wore black gowns and false beards, advertised in the newspapers, and\r\npainted their houses with magical figures and planetary emblems.[656]\r\n\r\nIn 1783 Mr. J. T. Smith describes how he made for Mr. Crowle, the\r\nillustrator of Pennant, a sketch of Old Simon, a well-known character, who\r\ntook his station daily under one of the gate piers of the old red and\r\nbrown brick gateway at the northern end of St. Giles’s Churchyard, which\r\nthen faced Mr. Remnent’s timber-yard. This man wore several hats, and was\r\nremarkable for a long, dirty, yellowish white beard. His chapped fingers\r\nwere adorned with brass rings. He had several coats and waistcoats--the\r\nupper wrap-rascle covering bundles of rags, parcels of books, canisters of\r\nbread and cheese, matches, a tinder-box, meat for his dog, scraps from\r\n_Fox’s Book of Martyrs_, and three or four dog’s-eared, thumbed, and\r\ngreasy numbers of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_. From these random leaves he\r\ngathered much information, which he retailed to persons who stopped to\r\nlook at him. Simon and his dog lodged under a staircase in an old\r\nshattered building in Dyot Street, known as “Rat’s Castle.” It was in this\r\nbeggars’ rendezvous that Nollekens the sculptor used to seek models for\r\nhis Grecian Venuses. Rowlandson etched Simon several times in his usual\r\ngross but droll manner.[657] There was also a whole-length print of him\r\npublished by John Seago, with this monumental inscription--“Simon Edy,\r\nborn at Woodford, near Thrapston, Northamptonshire, in 1709. Died May\r\n18th, 1783.”\r\n\r\nSimon had had several dogs, which, one after the other, were stolen, and\r\nsent for sale at Islington, or killed for their teeth by men employed by\r\nthe dentists. The following anecdote is told of his last and most faithful\r\ndog:--Rover had been a shepherd’s dog at Harrow, and having its left eye\r\nstruck out by a bullock’s horn, was left with Simon by its master, a\r\nSmithfield drover. The beggar tied him to his arm with a long string,\r\ncured him, and then restored him to the drover. After that, the dog would\r\nstop at St. Giles’s porch every market-day on its way after the drover to\r\nthe slaughter-house in Union Street, and receive caresses from the hand\r\nwhich had bathed its wound. Rover would then yelp for joy and gratitude,\r\nand scamper off to get up with the erring bullocks. At last poor Simon\r\nmissed the dog for several weeks; at the end of that time it appeared one\r\nmorning at his feet, and with its one sorrowful and uplifted eye implored\r\nSimon’s protection by licking his tawny beard. His master the drover was\r\ndead. Simon was only too glad to adopt Rover, who eventually followed him\r\nto his last home.\r\n\r\nThere was an elegy printed for good-natured, inoffensive old Simon, with a\r\nwoodcut portrait attached. The Hon. Daines Barrington is said to have\r\nnever passed the old mendicant without giving him sixpence.\r\n\r\nMr. J. T. Smith, himself afterwards Curator of the Prints at the British\r\nMuseum, published some curious etchings of beggars and street characters\r\nin 1815. Amongst them are ragged men carrying placards of “The Grand\r\nGolden Lottery;” strange old-clothesmen in cocked hats and two-tier wigs;\r\nitinerant wood-merchants; sellers of toys, such as “young lambs” or live\r\nhaddock; flying piemen in pig tails and shorts; women in gipsy hats;\r\ndoor-mat sellers; vendors of hot peas, pickled cucumbers, lemons,\r\nwindmills (toys); and, last and least, Sir Harry Dimsdale, the dwarf Mayor\r\nof Garratt.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the beggars of St. Giles in 1815 we gather pretty\r\naccurately from the evidence given by Mr. Sampson Stevenson, overseer of\r\nthe parish, and by trade an ironmonger at No. 11 King Street, Seven Dials,\r\nbefore a committee of the House of Commons, the Right Honourable George\r\nRose in the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevenson’s shop was not more than a few yards from one of the\r\nbeggars’ chief rendezvous, and he had therefore been enabled to closely\r\nstudy their habits. The inn had lost its licence, as the landlord\r\nencouraged thieves; and he had made inquiries of petition-writers, the\r\nhighest class of mendicants. He had gone frequently into the bar of the\r\nFountain in King Street, another of their haunts, to watch their\r\ngoings-on. The pretended sailors never carried anything on their backs, as\r\nthey only begged or extorted money; but the other rogues, who made it\r\ntheir practice to ask for food and clothing, always carried a knapsack to\r\nput it in. They returned laden with shoes and clothes, which they would\r\nsell in Monmouth Street. They had been heard to say that they had made\r\nthree or four shillings a day by begging shoes alone.[658] Their mode of\r\nobtaining charity was to go barefoot and scarify their heels so that the\r\nblood might show. They went out two or three together, or more, and\r\ninvariably changed their routes each day. Mr. Stevenson had seen them pull\r\nout their money and share it. Victuals, he believed, they threw away; but\r\neverything else they sold. They would stop at the Fountain till the house\r\nclosed, or till they got drunk, began to fight, and were turned out by the\r\npublican, who feared the losing his licence. They probably went to even\r\nlower places to finish their revel.\r\n\r\n“They teach other,” he said, “different modes of extortion. They are of\r\nthe worst character, and overwhelm you with cursing and abuse if you\r\nrefuse them money. There is one special rascal, Gannee Manos, who is\r\nscarcely three months in the year out of gaol. He always goes barefoot,\r\nand scratches his ankles to make them bleed. He is the greatest collector\r\nof shoes and clothes, as he goes the most naked to excite compassion.”\r\nAnother man had been known in the streets for fifteen or twenty years. He\r\ngenerally limped or passed as a cripple; but Mr. Stevenson has seen him\r\nfencing and jumping about like a pugilist. He went without a hat, with\r\nbare arms, and a canvas bag on his back. He generally began by singing a\r\nsong, and he carried primroses or something in his hand. He pretended to\r\nbe scarcely able to move one foot before the other; but if a Bow Street\r\nofficer or a beadle came in sight, he was off as quick as any one. There\r\nwas another man, an Irishman who had had a good education, and had been in\r\nthe medical line; he wrote a beautiful hand, and drew up petitions for\r\nbeggars at sixpence or a shilling each.\r\n\r\n“These men come out by twenties and thirties from the bottom of Dyot\r\nStreet, and then branch off five or six together. The one who has still\r\nsome money left starts them with a pint or half a pint of gin. They have\r\nall their divisions, and they quarter the town into sections. Some of them\r\ncollect three, four, or five children, paying sixpence a day for each, and\r\nthen they go begging in gangs, setting the children crying to excite\r\npeople’s sympathies. The Irish sometimes have the impudence to bring these\r\nchildren to the board and claim relief, and swear the children are their\r\nown. In a short time they are found out; but till the discovery their\r\nlandlords will swear their story is true. Sometimes, by giving their own\r\ncountry people something, the landlords help to detect them. But even in\r\ncases where the children are their own, they will not work when they have\r\nonce got into the habit of begging. If they will not come into the\r\nworkhouse, their relief is instantly stopped.\r\n\r\n“They spend their evenings drinking, after dining at an eating-house.\r\nDeserving people never beg: they are ashamed of it. They do not eat broken\r\nvictuals. They have seldom any lodgings. There are houses where forty or\r\nfifty of them sleep. A porter stands at the door and takes the money. In\r\nthe morning there is a general muster to see they have stolen nothing, and\r\nthen the doors are unlocked. For threepence they have clean straw, for\r\nfourpence something more decent, and for sixpence a bed. These are all\r\nprofessional beggars; they beg every day, even Sundays. They will not\r\nwork; they get more money by begging. Sometimes during hard frosts they\r\npretend to beg for work; but their children are sent out early by their\r\nparents to certain prescribed stations to beg, sometimes with a broom. If\r\nthey do not bring home more or less according to their size, they are\r\nbeaten. A large family of children is a revenue to these people.”\r\n\r\nWhen beggars did not get enough for their subsistence, Mr. Stevenson\r\nbelieved that they had a fund amongst themselves, as they so seldom\r\napplied for relief. The Irish were generally afraid to apply, for fear of\r\nbeing returned to their own country. Beggars had been heard to brag of\r\ngetting six, seven, and eight shillings a day, or more; and if one got\r\nmore than the others, he divided it with the rest. Mr. Stevenson concluded\r\nhis evidence by saying that there were so many low Irish in St. Giles’s,\r\nthat out of £30,000 a year collected in that parish by poor-rate, £20,000\r\nwent to this low and shifting population, that decreased in summer and\r\nincreased in winter.\r\n\r\nFrom one or two specimens culled from the London newspapers in 1829 we do\r\nnot augur much improvement in the character and habits of the St. Giles’s\r\nbeggars. On the 12th of July 1829 John Driscoll, an old professional\r\nmendicant, was brought up at the Marylebone Police-office, charged with\r\nbegging, annoying respectable persons, and even following fashionably\r\ndressed ladies into shops. In his pockets were found a small sum of money,\r\nsome ham sandwiches, and an invitation ticket signed “Car Durre,\r\nchairman.” It requested the favour of Mr. Driscoll’s company on Monday\r\nevening next, at seven o’clock, at the Robin Hood, Church Street, St.\r\nGiles’s, for the purpose of taking supper with others in his line of\r\ncalling or profession. Mr. Rawlinson said he supposed that an alderman in\r\nchains would grace the beggars’ festive board, but he would at least\r\nprevent the prisoner forming one of the party on Monday, and sent him to\r\nthe House of Correction for fourteen days.[659]\r\n\r\nThe same day one of those men who chalk “I am starving” on the pavement\r\nwas also sent to the treadmill for fourteen days. Francis Fisher, the\r\nprisoner in question, was one of a gang of forty pavement chalkers. In the\r\nevening, “after work,” these men changed their dress, and with their\r\nladies enjoyed themselves over a good supper, brandy and water, and\r\ncigars. In the winter time, when they excited more compassion, their\r\naverage earnings were ten shillings a day. This would make £20 a day for\r\nthe gang, and no less than £7300 a year.\r\n\r\nMonmouth Street is generally supposed to have derived its name from the\r\nDuke of Monmouth, Charles II.’s natural son, whose town house stood close\r\nby in Soho Square. It was perhaps named from Carey, Earl of Monmouth, who\r\ndied in 1626, and his son, who died in 1661: they were both parishioners\r\nof St. Giles’s.[660] It was early known as the great mart for old clothes,\r\nbut was superseded in later times by Holy Well Street, which in its turn\r\nwas displaced by the Minories. Lady Mary Wortley alludes to the lace coats\r\nhung up for sale in Monmouth Street like Irish patents. Even Prior, in his\r\npleasant metaphysical poem of “Alma,” says--\r\n\r\n  “This looks, friend Dick, as Nature had\r\n  But exercised the salesman’s trade,\r\n  As if she haply had sat down\r\n  And cut out clothes for all the town,\r\n  Then sent them out to Monmouth Street,\r\n  To try what persons they would fit.”\r\n\r\nGay also alludes to this Jewish street in the following distich in his\r\n“Trivia”--\r\n\r\n  “Thames Street gives cheeses, Covent Garden fruits,\r\n  Moorfields old books, and Monmouth Street old suits.”\r\n\r\nMost of the shops in Monmouth Street were occupied by Jew dealers in 1849,\r\nand horse-shoes were then to be seen nailed under the door-steps of the\r\ncellars to scare away witches.[661]\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Dickens in his _Sketches by Boz_, published in 1836-7,\r\ndescribes Seven Dials and Monmouth Street as they then appeared. The maze\r\nof streets, the unwholesome atmosphere, the men in fustian spotted with\r\nbrickdust or whitewash, and chronically leaning against posts, are all\r\npainted by this great artist with the accuracy of a Dutch painter. The\r\nwriter boldly plunges into the region of “first effusions and last dying\r\nspeeches, hallowed by the names of Catnach and of Pitts,” and carries us\r\nat once into a fight between two half-drunk Irish termagants outside a\r\ngin-shop. He then takes us to the dirty straggling houses, the dark\r\nchandler’s shop, the rag and bone stores, the broker’s den, the\r\nbird-fancier’s room as full as Noah’s ark, and completes the picture with\r\na background of dirty men, filthy women, squalid children, fluttering\r\nshuttlecocks, noisy battledores, reeking pipes, bad fruit, more than\r\ndoubtful oysters, attenuated cats, depressed dogs, and anatomised fowls.\r\nEvery house has, he says, at least a dozen tenants. The man in the shop is\r\nin the “baked jemmy” line, or deals in firewood and hearthstones. An Irish\r\nlabourer and his family occupy the back kitchen, while a jobbing\r\ncarpet-beater is in the front. In the front one pair there’s another\r\nfamily, and in the back one pair a young woman who takes in tambour-work.\r\nIn the back attic is a mysterious man who never buys anything but coffee,\r\npenny loaves, and ink, and is supposed to write poems for Mr. Warren.[662]\r\n\r\nThe Monmouth Street inhabitants Mr. Dickens describes as a peaceable,\r\nthoughtful, and dirty race, who immure themselves in deep cellars or small\r\nback parlours, and seldom come forth till the dusk and cool of the\r\nevening, when, seated in chairs on the pavement, smoking their pipes, they\r\nwatch the gambols of their children as they revel in the gutter, a happy\r\ntroop of infantine scavengers.\r\n\r\n“A Monmouth Street laced coat” was a byword a century ago, but still we\r\nfind Monmouth Street the same. Pilot coats, double-breasted check\r\nwaistcoats, low broad-brimmed coachmen’s hats, and skeleton suits, have\r\nusurped the place of the old attire; but Monmouth Street, said Charles\r\nDickens, is still “the burial-place of the fashions, and we love to walk\r\namong these extensive groves of the illustrious dead, and indulge in the\r\nspeculations to which they give rise.”[663]\r\n\r\nIn 1816 there were said to be 2348 Irish people resident in St. Giles’s;\r\nbut an Irish witness before a committee of the House declared there were\r\n6000 Irish, and 3000 children in the neighbourhood of George Street alone.\r\nIn 1815 there were 14,164 Irish in the whole of London.[664] The Irish\r\nportion of the parish of St. Giles’s was known by the name of the Holy\r\nLand in 1829.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SEVEN DIALS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LINCOLN’S INN FIELDS THEATRE, 1821.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S INN FIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln’s Inn, originally belonging to the Black Friars before they\r\nremoved Thames-ward, derives its name from Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln,\r\nto whom it was given by Edward I., and whose town house or inn stood on\r\nthe same site in the reign of Edward I. Earl Henry died in 1312, the year\r\nin which Gaveston was killed, and his monument was one of the stateliest\r\nin the old church. His arms are still those of the inn and of its\r\ntributaries, Furnival’s and Thavies inns. There is yet extant an old\r\naccount of the earl’s bailiff, relating to the sale of the fruit of his\r\nmaster’s garden. The noble’s table was supplied and the residue sold. The\r\napples, pears, large nuts, and cherries, the beans, onions, garlic, and\r\nleeks, produced a profit of £9: 2: 3 (about £135 in modern money). The\r\nonly flowers were roses. The bailiff, it appears, expended 8s. a year in\r\npurchasing small fry, frogs, and eels, to feed the pike in the pond or\r\nvivary.[665]\r\n\r\nPart of the Chancery Lane side of Lincoln’s Inn was in 1217 and 1272 “the\r\nmansion house” of William de Haverhill, treasurer to King Henry III. He\r\nwas attainted for treason, and his house and lands were confiscated to the\r\nking, who then gave his house to Ralph Neville, Chancellor of England and\r\nBishop of Chichester, who built there “a fair house;” and the Bishops of\r\nChichester inhabited it there till Henry VII.’s time, when they let it to\r\nlaw students, reserving lodgings for themselves, and it fell into the\r\nhands of Judge Sulyard and other feoffees. This family held it till\r\nElizabeth’s time, when Sir Edward Sulyard, of Essex, sold the estate to\r\nthe Benchers,[666] who then began enlarging their frontier and building.\r\n\r\nThe plain Tudor gateway with the two side towers soaked with black smoke,\r\nthe oldest part of the existing structure, was built in 1518 by Sir Thomas\r\nLovell, a member of this inn and treasurer of the household to Henry VII.,\r\nwhen great alterations took place in the inn. What thousands of wise men\r\nand rogues have passed under its murky shadow! None of the original\r\nbuilding is left. The Black Friars’ House fronted the Holborn end of the\r\nBishop’s Palace.[667] The chambers adjoining the Gate House are of a later\r\ndate and it was at these that Mr. Cunningham thinks Ben Jonson\r\nworked.[668]\r\n\r\nThe chapel, of debased Perpendicular Gothic, was built by Inigo Jones, and\r\nconsecrated in 1623, Dr. Donne the poet preaching the consecration sermon.\r\nThe stained glass was the work of a Mr. Hale of Fetter Lane. The twelve\r\napostles, Moses, and the prophets still glow like immortal flowers,\r\nbright as when Donne, or Ussher, watched the light they shed. One of the\r\nwindows bears the name of Bernard van Linge, the same man probably who\r\nexecuted the windows at Wadham College, Oxford.[669] Noy, the\r\nAttorney-General and creature of Charles I., a friend of Laud, and the\r\nproposer of the writ for ship-money, put up the window representing John\r\nthe Baptist, rather an ominous saint, surely, in Charles’s time. Noy died\r\nin 1634, before the storm which would certainly have carried his head off.\r\nHe left his money to a prodigal son, who was afterwards killed in a\r\nduel,--“Left to be squandered, and I hope no better from him,” says the\r\ndying man, bitterly. It was Noy who decided the curious case of the three\r\ngraziers who left their money with their hostess. One of them afterwards\r\nreturned and ran off with the money; upon which the other two sued the\r\nwoman, denying their consent. Mr. Noy pleaded that the money was ready to\r\nbe given up directly the three men came together and claimed it.[670]\r\nRogers tells this story in his poem of “Italy,” and gives it a romantic\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nLaud, always restless for novelties that could look like Rome, and yet not\r\nbe Rome, referred to the Lincoln’s Inn windows at his trial. He wondered\r\nat a Mr. Brown objecting to such things, considering he was not of\r\nLincoln’s Inn, “where Mr. Prynne’s zeal had not yet beaten down the images\r\nof the apostles in the fair windows of that chapel, which windows were set\r\nup new long since the statute of Edward VI.; and it is well known,” says\r\nthat enemy of the Puritans, “that I was once resolved to have returned\r\nthis upon Mr. Brown in the House of Commons, but changed my mind, lest\r\nthereby I might have set some furious spirit at work to destroy those\r\nharmless goodly windows, to the just dislike of that worthy society.”[671]\r\n\r\nThe crypt under the chapel rests on many pillars and strong-backed arches,\r\nand, like the cloisters in the Temple, was intended as a place for\r\nstudent-lawyers to walk in and exchange learning. Butler describes\r\nwitnesses of the straw-bail species waiting here for customers,[672] just\r\nas half a century ago they used to haunt the doors of Chancery Lane\r\ngin-shops. On a June day in 1663 Pepys came to walk under the chapel by\r\nappointment, after pacing up and down and admiring the new garden then\r\nconstructing.\r\n\r\nThe great Sir Thomas More, Chancellor of England in Henry VIII.’s time,\r\nhad chambers at Lincoln’s Inn when he was living in Bucklersbury after his\r\nmarriage. This was about 1506. He wrote his _Utopia_ in 1516. King Henry\r\ngrew so fond of More’s learned and witty conversation, that he used to\r\nconstantly send for him to supper, and would walk in the garden at Chelsea\r\nwith his arm round his neck. More was beheaded in 1535 for refusing to\r\ntake the oath of succession and acknowledge the legality of the king’s\r\ndivorce from Catherine of Arragon. Erasmus, who knew More well, inscribed\r\nthe “Nux” of Ovid to his son. More’s skull is still preserved, it is said,\r\nin the vault of St. Dunstan’s Church at Canterbury.[673] More’s daughter,\r\nMargaret Roper, was buried with it in her arms.\r\n\r\nDr. Donne, the divine and poet, whose mother was distantly related to Sir\r\nThomas More and to Heywood the epigrammatist, was a student at Lincoln’s\r\nInn in his seventeenth year, but left it to squander his father’s fortune.\r\nHe was a friend of Bacon, with whom he lived for five years, and also of\r\nBen Jonson, who corresponded with him. When young, Donne had written a\r\nthesis to prove that suicide is no sin. “That,” he used to say in later\r\nyears, “was written by Jack Donne, not by Dr. Donne.”\r\n\r\nThis same poet was for two years preacher at Lincoln’s Inn; so was the\r\ncharitable and amiable Tillotson in 1663. The latter, after preaching the\r\ndoctrine of non-resistance before King Charles II., was nicknamed “Hobbes\r\nin the pulpit;” he and Dr. Burnet both tried in vain to force the same\r\ndoctrine on Lord William Russell when he was preparing for death.\r\nTillotson, who was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1691 by King William,\r\nwas a valued friend of Locke. Addison considered Tillotson’s three folio\r\nvolumes of sermons to be the standard of English, and meant to make them\r\nthe ground-work of a dictionary which he had projected. Warburton, a\r\nsterner critic, denies that the sermons are oratorical like Jeremy\r\nTaylor’s, or thoughtful like Barrow’s, but yet confesses them to be clear,\r\nrational, equable,[674] and certainly not without a noble simplicity.\r\n\r\nAmong the most eminent students of Lincoln’s Inn we must remember Sir\r\nMatthew Hale. After a wild and vain youth, Hale suddenly commenced\r\nstudying sixteen hours a day,[675] and became so careless of dress that he\r\nwas once seized by a pressgang. The sight of a friend who fell down in a\r\nfit from excessive drinking led to this honest man’s renouncing all\r\nrevelry and becoming unchangeably religious. Noy directed him in his\r\nstudies; he became a friend of Selden, and was one of the counsel for\r\nStrafford, Laud, and the king himself. Nevertheless, he obtained the\r\nesteem of Cromwell, who was tolerant of all shades of goodness. He died\r\n1675-6. When a nobleman once complained to Charles II. that Hale would not\r\ndiscuss with him the arguments in his cause then before him, Charles\r\nreplied, “Ods fish, man! he would have treated me just the same.”\r\n\r\nLord Chancellor Egerton, afterwards Lord Ellesmere, was of Lincoln’s Inn.\r\nHis son became Earl of Bridgewater. He was a friend of Lord Bacon, and had\r\na celebrated dispute with Chief Justice Coke as to whether “the Chancery\r\ncan relieve by subpœna after a judgment at law in the same cause.”\r\nPrudent, discreet, and honest, Ellesmere was esteemed by both Elizabeth\r\nand James, and died at York House in 1617. Bishop Hacket says of him that\r\n“He neither did, spoke, nor thought anything in his life but what deserved\r\npraise.”[676] It is said that many persons used to go to the Chancery\r\nCourt only to see and admire his venerable presence.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Spelman was admitted of Lincoln’s Inn. He was a friend of\r\nDugdale, and one of our earliest students of Anglo-Saxon. He wrote much\r\non civil law, sacrilege, and tithes. Aubrey tells us that he was thought a\r\ndunce at school, and did not seriously sit down to hard study till he was\r\nabout forty. This eminent scholar died in 1641, and was interred with\r\ngreat solemnity in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nShaftesbury, the subtle and dangerous, and one of the restorers of the\r\nking he afterwards worked so hard to depose, was of Lincoln’s Inn.\r\n\r\nAshmole, the great herald, antiquary, and numismatist, originally a London\r\nattorney, was married in Lincoln’s Inn Chapel, in 1668, to the daughter of\r\nhis great colleague in topography and heraldry, Sir William Dugdale, the\r\npart compiler of the _Monasticon_.\r\n\r\nIn the chapel was buried Alexander Brome, a Royalist attorney, a\r\ntranslator of Horace, and a great writer of sharp songs against “The\r\nRump,” who died in 1666. Here also--in loving companionship with him only\r\nbecause dead--rests that irritable Puritan lawyer, William Prynne. He\r\ntwice lost an ear in the pillory, besides being branded on the cheek. He\r\nultimately opposed Cromwell and aided the return of Charles, for which he\r\nwas made Keeper of the Tower Records. His works amount to forty folio and\r\nquarto volumes. He left copies of them to the Lincoln’s Inn library.\r\nNeedham calls him “the greatest paper-worm that ever crept into a\r\nlibrary.” He died in his Lincoln’s Inn chambers in 1669. Wood computes\r\nthat Prynne wrote as much as would amount to a sheet for every day of his\r\nlife. His epitaph had been erased when Wood wrote the _Athenæ Oxonienses_\r\nin 1691.\r\n\r\nIn the same chapel lies Secretary Thurloe, the son of an Essex rector and\r\nthe faithful servant of Cromwell. He was admitted of Lincoln’s Inn in\r\n1647, and in 1654 was chosen one of the masters of the upper bench. He\r\ndied suddenly in his chambers in Lincoln’s Inn in 1668. Dr. Birch\r\npublished several folio volumes of his _State Papers_. He seems to have\r\nbeen an honest, dull, plodding man. Thurloe’s chambers were at No. 24 in\r\nthe south angle of the great court leading out of Chancery Lane, formerly\r\ncalled the Gatehouse Court, but now Old Buildings--the rooms on the left\r\nhand of the ground-floor. Here Thurloe had chambers from 1645 to 1659.\r\nCromwell must have often come here to discuss dissolutions of Parliament\r\nand Dutch treaties. State papers sufficient to fill sixty-seven folio\r\nvolumes were discovered in a false ceiling in the garret by a clergyman\r\nwho had borrowed the chambers of a friend during the long vacation. He\r\ndisposed of them to Lord Chancellor Somers.[677] Cautious old Thurloe had\r\nperhaps sown these papers, hoping to reap the harvest under some new\r\nCromwellian dynasty that never came.\r\n\r\nRushworth the historian was a barrister of Lincoln’s Inn. During the Civil\r\nWars he was assistant clerk to the House of Commons. After the Restoration\r\nhe became secretary to the Lord Keeper, but falling into distress, died in\r\nthe King’s Bench in 1690. His eight folio volumes of _Historical\r\nCollections_ are specially valuable.[678]\r\n\r\nSir John Denham also studied in this pasturing-ground of English genius;\r\nand here, after squandering all his money in gaming, he wrote an essay\r\nupon the vice that brings its own punishment. In 1641, when his tragedy of\r\n“The Sophy” appeared, Waller said that Denham had broken out like the\r\nIrish rebellion, threescore thousand strong. In 1643 appeared his\r\n“Cooper’s Hill” which the lampooners declared the author had bought of a\r\nvicar for forty pounds.[679] He became mad for a short time at the close\r\nof life, and was then ridiculed by Butler, so says Dr. Johnson. He died in\r\n1668, and was interred in Westminster Abbey. Denham and Waller smoothed\r\nthe way for Dryden,[680] and founded the Pope school of highly polished\r\nartificial verse. Denham’s noble apostrophe to the river Thames is all but\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wither, one of our fine old poets of a true school, rougher but\r\nmore natural than Denham’s, the son of a Hampshire farmer, entered at\r\nLincoln’s Inn. Sent to the Marshalsea for his just but indiscreet satires,\r\nhe turned soldier, fought against the Royalists, and became one of\r\nCromwell’s dreaded major-generals. He was in Newgate for a long time after\r\nthe Restoration, and died in 1667. When taken prisoner by Charles, Sir\r\nJohn Denham obtained his release on the humorous pretext that, while\r\nWither lived, he (Denham) would not be the worst poet in England.[681]\r\n\r\nIn No. 1 New Square, Arthur Murphy, the friend of Dr. Johnson, resided for\r\ntwenty-three years. He became a member of the inn in 1757. In 1788 he sold\r\nhis chambers, and retired from the bar. As a journalist he was ridiculed\r\nby Wilkes and Churchill. His plays, “The Grecian Daughter” and “Three\r\nWeeks after Marriage,” were successful. He also translated Tacitus and\r\nSallust. He died in 1805.[682]\r\n\r\nJudge Fortescue, a great English lawyer of the time of Henry VI., was a\r\nstudent of this inn. He wrote his great work, _De Laudibus Legum Angliæ_\r\nto educate Prince Edward when in banishment in Lorraine. This pious,\r\nloyal, and learned man, after being nominal Chancellor, returned to\r\nretirement in England, and acknowledged Edward IV.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Mansfield belonged to the same illustrious inn. For elegance\r\nof mind, for honesty and industry, and for eloquence, he stands\r\nunrivalled. The proceedings against Wilkes, and the destruction of his\r\nhouse in Bloomsbury by the fanatical mob of 1780, were the chief events of\r\nhis useful life.\r\n\r\nSpencer Perceval was of Lincoln’s Inn. A son of the Earl of Egmont, he\r\nbecame a student here in 1782. In Parliament he supported Pitt and the war\r\nagainst Napoleon. In 1801, under the Addington ministry, he became\r\nAttorney-General, and persecuted Peltier for a libel on Bonaparte during\r\nthe peace of Amiens. On the death of the Duke of Portland he was raised to\r\nthe head of the Treasury, where he continued till May 1812, when he was\r\nshot through the heart in the lobby of the House of Commons by Bellingham,\r\na bankrupt merchant of Archangel, who considered himself aggrieved because\r\nministers had not taken his part and claimed redress for his losses from\r\nthe Russian Government. Perceval was a shrewd, even-tempered lawyer,\r\nfluent and industrious, who, had time been permitted him, might possibly\r\nhave proved more completely than he did his incapacity for high\r\nministerial command.\r\n\r\nGeorge Canning became a student at Lincoln’s Inn in 1781. His father was a\r\nbankrupt wine-merchant who died of a broken heart. His mother was a\r\nprovincial actress. His relation, Sheridan, introduced him to Fox, Grey,\r\nand Burke, the latter of whom, it is said, induced him to make politics\r\nhis profession. He made his maiden speech, attacking Fox and supporting\r\nPitt, in 1794. Late in life he gradually began to support some liberal\r\nmeasures. In 1827 he became First Lord of the Treasury, and died a few\r\nmonths afterwards in the zenith of his power.\r\n\r\nLord Lyndhurst was also one of the glories of this inn. The trial of Dr.\r\nWatson for treason, in 1817, first gained for this son of an American\r\npainter a reputation which, joined with his prudent conduct in the trial\r\nof Cashman the rioter led to his being appointed Solicitor-General in\r\n1818. From that he rose in rapid succession, to the posts of\r\nAttorney-General, Master of the Rolls, Lord Chancellor, and Lord\r\nLyndhurst. Old, eccentric, “irrepressible” Sir Charles Wetherell was\r\nCopley’s fellow-advocate in Watson’s case, that ended in the prisoner’s\r\nacquittal.[683] In 1827, when Abbott became Lord Tenterden, Copley\r\naccepted the Great Seal, displacing Lord Eldon, and joined Canning’s\r\ncabinet, becoming Lord Lyndhurst. In 1830 he became Chief Baron of the\r\nExchequer.\r\n\r\nCharles Pepys, Lord Cottenham, born 1781, was called to the bar by the\r\nSociety of Lincoln’s Inn in 1804. He was appointed King’s Counsel in 1826,\r\nwas made Solicitor-General in 1834, succeeded Sir John Leach as Master of\r\nthe Rolls in the same year, and was elevated to the woolsack in 1836. This\r\nChancellor, who was a very excellent lawyer, was descended from a branch\r\nof the family of Samuel Pepys, author of the celebrated _Diary_.\r\n\r\nSir E. Sugden was a member of Lincoln’s Inn. He was born in the year 1781.\r\nHe was the son of a Westminster hairdresser who became rich by inventing a\r\nsubstitute for hair-powder. He was created Lord St. Leonards on the\r\nformation of a Conservative ministry in 1852, when he accepted the Great\r\nSeal.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham also studied in Lincoln’s Inn. He was born in 1778, and\r\nstarted the _Edinburgh Review_ in 1802. In 1820 he defended Queen\r\nCaroline; but it would take a volume to follow the career of this\r\nimpetuous and versatile genius. His struggles for law-reform, for Catholic\r\nemancipation, for abolition of slavery, for the education of the people,\r\nand for Parliamentary reform, are matters of history. In his old age,\r\nthough still vigorous, Lord Brougham grew tamer, and condemned the armed\r\nemancipation of slaves practised by the Northern States in the present\r\nAmerican war. He died at his residence at Cannes in the South of France in\r\n1868.\r\n\r\nCottenham and Campbell were students in Lincoln’s Inn; so was that\r\neccentric reformer Jeremy Bentham, who was called to the bar in 1722, and\r\nwas the son of a Houndsditch attorney; and so was Penn, the founder of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThat “luminary of the Irish Church,”[684] Archbishop Ussher, was preacher\r\nat Lincoln’s Inn in 1647, the society giving the good man handsome rooms\r\nready furnished. He continued to preach there for eight years, till his\r\neyesight began to fail. He died in 1655, and was buried, by Cromwell’s\r\npermission, with great magnificence, in Erasmus’s chapel in Westminster\r\nAbbey. His library of 10,000 volumes, bought of him by Cromwell’s\r\nofficers, was given by Charles II. to Dublin College. Ussher, when only\r\neighteen, was the David who discomfited in public dispute the learned\r\nJesuit Fitz-Simons. He saw Charles beheaded from the roof of a house on\r\nthe site of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nDr. Langhorne, the joint translator with his brother of the _Lives of\r\nPlutarch_, was assistant preacher at Lincoln’s Inn. An imitator of\r\nSterne, and a writer in Griffiths’s _Monthly Review_, he was praised by\r\nSmollett and abused by Churchill. Langhorne’s amiable poem, _The Country\r\nJustice_, was praised by Scott. He died in 1779.\r\n\r\nThat fiery controversialist Warburton was preacher at Lincoln’s Inn in\r\n1746, and the same year preached and published a sermon on the Highland\r\nrebellion. He was the son of an attorney at Newark-upon-Trent. His _Divine\r\nLegation_ was an effort to show that the absence of allusions in the\r\nwritings of Moses to a system of rewards and punishments was a proof of\r\ntheir divine origin. The book is full of perverse digressions. His edition\r\nof Shakspere is, perhaps, to use a fine expression of Burke, “one of the\r\npoorest maggots that ever crept from the great man’s carcase.” Pope left\r\nhalf his library to Warburton, who had suggested to him the conclusion of\r\nthe _Dunciad_. Wilkes, Bolingbroke, Dr. Louth, and Churchill were all by\r\nturns attacked by this arrogant knight-errant. Warburton died in 1779.\r\n\r\nReginald Heber, afterwards the excellent Bishop of Calcutta, was appointed\r\npreacher at Lincoln’s Inn in 1822, the year before he sailed for India. In\r\n1826 this good man was found dead in his bath at Trichinopoly. The sudden\r\ndeath of this energetic missionary was a great loss to East Indian\r\nChristianity. In the “company of the preachers” we must not forget the\r\nexcellent Dr. Van Mildert, afterwards Bishop of Durham, and Dr. Thomson\r\nthe present Archbishop of York.\r\n\r\nIn the old times the Lord Chancellor held his sittings in the great hall\r\nof Lincoln’s Inn. Here, too, at the Christmas revels, the King of the\r\nCockneys administered _his_ laws. Jack Straw, a sort of rebellious rival,\r\nwas put down, with all his adherents, as a bad precedent for the Essexes\r\nand Norfolks of the inn, by wary Queen Elizabeth, who always kept a firm\r\ngrip on her prerogative. In the same reign absurd sumptuary laws, vainly\r\ntrying to fix the quicksilver of fashion, forbade the students to wear\r\nlong hair, long beards, large ruffs, huge cloaks, or big spurs. The fine\r\nfor wearing a beard of more than a fortnight’s growth was three shillings\r\nand fourpence.[685] In her father’s time beards had been prohibited under\r\npain of double commons.\r\n\r\nIn the old hall, replaced by the new Tudor building, stood one of\r\nHogarth’s most pretentious but worst pictures, “Paul preaching before\r\nFelix,” an ill-drawn and ludicrous caricature of epic work. The society\r\npaid for it. It is now rolled up and hid away with as much contumely as\r\nKent’s absurdity at St. Clement’s when Hogarth parodied it.\r\n\r\nThe new hall of Lincoln’s Inn was built by Mr. P. Hardwick, the architect\r\nof the St. Katherine Docks, and was opened by the Queen in person in 1845.\r\nIt is a fine Tudor building of red brick, with stone dressings. The hall\r\nis 120 feet, the library 80 feet long. The contract was taken for £55,000,\r\nbut its cost exceeded that sum. The library contains the unique fourth\r\nvolume of Prynne’s _Records_, which the society bought for £335 at the\r\nStow sale in 1849, and all Sir Matthew Hale’s bequests of books and MSS.:\r\n“a treasure,” says that “excellent good man,” as Evelyn calls him[686] in\r\nhis will, “that is not fit for every man’s view.” The hall contains a\r\nfresco representing the “Lawgivers of the World,” by Watts. The gardens\r\nwere much curtailed by the erection of the hall, and their quietude\r\ndestroyed. Ben Jonson talks of the walks under the elms.[687] Steele seems\r\nto have been fond of this garden when he felt meditative. In May 1709, he\r\nsays much hurry and business having perplexed him into a mood too\r\nthoughtful for company, instead of the tavern “I went into Lincoln’s Inn\r\nWalk, and having taken a round or two, I sat down, according to the\r\nallowed familiarity of these places, on a bench.” In a more thoughtful\r\nmonth (November) of the same year he goes again for a solitary walk in the\r\ngarden, “a favour that is indulged me by several of the benchers, who are\r\nvery intimate friends, and grown old in the neighbourhood.” It was this\r\nbright frosty night, when the whole body of air had been purified into\r\n“bright transparent æther,” that Steele imagined his vision of “The\r\nReturn of the Golden Age.”\r\n\r\nBrave old Ben Jonson was the son of a Scotch gentleman in Henry VIII.’s\r\nservice, who, impoverished by the persecutions of Queen Mary, took orders\r\nlate in life. His mother married for the second time a small builder or\r\nmaster bricklayer. He went to Westminster school, where Camden, the great\r\nantiquary, was his master. A kind patron sent him to Cambridge.[688] He\r\nseems to have left college prematurely, and have come back to London to\r\nwork with his father-in-law.[689]\r\n\r\nThere is an old tradition that he worked at the garden-wall of Lincoln’s\r\nInn next to Chancery Lane, and that a knight or bencher (Sutton, or\r\nCamden), walking by, hearing him repeat a passage of Homer, entered into\r\nconversation with him, and finding him to have extraordinary wit, sent him\r\nback to college; or, as Fuller quaintly puts it, “some gentlemen pitying\r\nthat his parts should be buried under the rubbish of so mean a calling,\r\ndid by their bounty manumise him freely to follow his own ingenious\r\ninclinations.”[690]\r\n\r\nGifford sneers at the story, for the poet’s own words to Drummond of\r\nHawthornden were simply these:--“He could not endure the occupation of a\r\nbricklayer,” and therefore joined Vere in Flanders, probably going with\r\nreinforcements to Ostend in 1591-2.[691] He there fought and slew an\r\nenemy, and stripped him in sight of both armies. On his return, he became\r\nan actor at a Shoreditch theatre. His enemies, the rival satirists,\r\nfrequently sneer at the quondam profession of Ben Jonson, and describe him\r\nstamping on the stage as if he were treading mortar. For myself, I admire\r\nbrave, truculent old Ben, and delight even in his most crabbed and\r\npedantic verse, and therefore never pass Lincoln’s Inn garden without\r\nthinking of Shakspere’s honest but rugged friend--“a bear only in the\r\ncoat.”\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 1752, there was a dreadful fire in New Square, which\r\ndestroyed countless historical treasures, including Lord Somers’s original\r\nletters and papers.\r\n\r\nAt No. 2 and afterwards at No. 6 New Square, Lincoln’s Inn, which is built\r\non Little Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and forms no part of the Inn of court,\r\nlived Sir Samuel Romilly. This “great and amiable man,” as Tom Moore calls\r\nhim, killed himself in a fit of melancholy produced by overwork joined to\r\nthe loss of his wife, “a simple, gay, unlearned woman.” Sir Samuel was a\r\nstern, reserved man, and she was the only person in the world to whom he\r\ncould unbosom himself. When he lost her, he said, “the very vent of his\r\nheart was stopped up.”[692]\r\n\r\nIt was in Old Square, Lincoln’s Inn, that Benjamin Disraeli, born in\r\nDecember 1805, much too erratic for Plowden and Coke, used to come to\r\nstudy conveyancing at the chambers of Mr. Bassevi. He is described as\r\noften arriving with Spenser’s _Faerie Queen_ under his arm, stopping an\r\nhour or two to read, and then leaving. This led, as might be expected, not\r\nto the woolsack but to the authorship of _Coningsby_. His Premiership and\r\nhis Patent of Peerage as Lord Beaconsfield, are due to other causes.\r\n\r\nWhetstone Park, now a small quiet passage, full of printing-offices and\r\nstables, between Great Turnstile and Gate Street, derived its name from a\r\nvestryman of the time of Charles I. It is now chiefly occupied by mews,\r\nbut was once filled by infamous houses and low brandy-shops.\r\n\r\nIn 1671, the Duke of Monmouth, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of St.\r\nAlban’s, three of King Charles II.’s illegitimate sons, killed here a\r\nbeadle in a drunken brawl. A street-ballad was written on the occasion,\r\nmore full of spite against the corrupt court than of sympathy with the\r\nslain man. In poor doggerel the Catnach of 1671 describes the watch coming\r\nin, disturbed from sleep, to appease their graces--\r\n\r\n                  “Straight rose mortal jars,\r\n  ’Twixt the night blackguard and (the) silver stars;\r\n  Then fell the beadle by a ducal hand,\r\n  For daring to pronounce the saucy ‘Stand!’”\r\n\r\nSadly enough, the silly fellow’s death led to a dance at Whitehall being\r\nput off,--\r\n\r\n  “Disappoints the queen, ‘poor little chuck!’”[693]\r\n\r\nand all the brisk courtiers in their gay coats bought with the nation’s\r\nsubsidies.\r\n\r\nThe last two lines are vigorous, sarcastic, and worthy of a humble\r\nimitator of Dryden. The poet sums up--\r\n\r\n  “Yet shall Whitehall, the innocent and good,\r\n  See these men dance, all daubed with lace and blood.”\r\n\r\nIn 1682 the misnamed “Park” grew so infamous, that a countryman, having\r\nbeen decoyed into one of the houses and robbed, went into Smithfield and\r\ncollected an angry mob of about 500 apprentices, who marched on Whetstone\r\nPark, broke open the houses, and destroyed the furniture. The constables\r\nand watchmen, being outnumbered, sent for the king’s guard, who dispersed\r\nthem and took eleven of them. Nevertheless, the next night another mob\r\nstormed the place, again broke in the doors, smashed the windows, and cut\r\nthe feather-beds to pieces.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s Inn Fields formed part of the ancient Fickett’s Fields, a plot\r\nof ground of about ten acres, extending formerly from Bell Yard to\r\nPortugal Street and Carey Street. It seems to have been used in the Middle\r\nAges for jousts and tournaments by the Templars and Knights of St. John of\r\nJerusalem, to the priory of which last order it belonged till Henry VIII.\r\ndissolved the monasteries, when it was granted to Anthony Stringer. In an\r\ninquest of the time of James I. it is described as having two gates for\r\nhorses and carriages at the east end--one gate leading into Chancery Lane,\r\nthe other gate at the western end.[694]\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth, afraid that London was growing unwieldly, issued several\r\nproclamations against further building. James I., still more timid and\r\nconservative, and not thoroughly acquainted with his own capital, issued a\r\nlike absurd ukase in 1612, by the desire of the benchers and students of\r\nLincoln’s Inn, forbidding the erection of new houses in these fields. But\r\nno royal edict can prevent a demand for creating a supply, and as the\r\nbuilding still went on, a commission was appointed in 1618 to lay out the\r\nsquare in a regular plan. Bacon, then Lord Chancellor, and many noblemen,\r\njudges, and masters in Chancery, were on this commission, and Inigo Jones,\r\nthe king’s Surveyor-General, drew up the scheme. The report of this body,\r\ngiven by Rymer, sets out that in the last sixteen years there had been\r\nmore building near and about the City of London than in ages before, and\r\nthat as these fields were much surrounded by the dwellings and lodgings of\r\nnoblemen and gentlemen of quality, “all small cottages and closes shall be\r\npaid for and removed, and the square shall be reduced,” both for\r\nsweetness, uniformity, and comeliness, as an ornament to the City, and for\r\nthe health and recreation of the inhabitants, into walks and partitions,\r\nas Mr. Inigo Jones should in his map devise.[695]\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that the area of the square, according to Inigo\r\nJones’s plan, was to have been made the exact dimensions of the base of\r\nthe great pyramid of Geezeh. The tradition is probably true, for the area\r\nof the pyramid is 535,824 square feet, and that of Lincoln’s Inn Fields\r\n550,000.[696] The height of the pyramid was 756 feet.\r\n\r\nThe plan proved too costly, and the subscriptions began probably to fail;\r\nbut in the course of time noblemen and others began to build for\r\nthemselves, but without much regard to uniformity.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Inigo’s plan for the Fields, painted in oil colours, is\r\nstill preserved at Wilton House, near Salisbury. The view is taken from\r\nthe south, and the principal feature in the elevation is Lindsey House in\r\nthe centre of the west side, whose stone façade, still existing, stands\r\nboldly out from the brick houses which support it on either side. The\r\ninternal accommodation of Lindsey House was never good.[697]\r\n\r\nThese fields in Charles I.’s time became the haunt of wrestlers, bowlers,\r\nbeggars, and idle boys; and here, in 1624, Lilly the astrologer, then\r\nservant to a mantua-maker in the Strand, spent his time in bowling with\r\nWat the cobbler, Dick the blacksmith, and such idle apprentices. Hither,\r\nafter the Restoration, came every sort of villain--the Rufflers, or maimed\r\nsoldiers, who told lies of Edgehill and Naseby, and who surrounded the\r\ncoaches of charitable lords; “Dommerers,” or sham dumb men; “Mumpers,” or\r\nsham broken gentlemen; “Whipjacks,” or sham seamen with bound-up legs;\r\n“Abram-men,” or sham idiots; “Fraters,” or rogues with forged patents;\r\n“Anglers,” wild rogues, “Clapper-dudgeons,”[698] and men with gambling\r\nwheels of fortune.\r\n\r\nIn Queen Anne’s reign Gay sketches the dangers of night in these fields;\r\nhe warns his readers to avoid the lurking thief, by day a beggar, or\r\nelse--\r\n\r\n  “The crutch, which late compassion moved, shall wound\r\n  Thy bleeding head, and fell thee to the ground.\r\n\r\nNor trust the linkman,” he adds, “along the lonely wall, or he’ll put out\r\nhis light and rob you, but--\r\n\r\n  “Still keep the public streets where oily rays\r\n  That from the crystal lamp o’erspread the ways.”\r\n\r\nThe south side of Lincoln’s Inn Fields was built and named three years\r\nbefore the Restoration, by Sir William Cowper, James Cowper, and Robert\r\nHenley. In 1668 Portugal Row, as it was called, but not from Charles’s\r\nqueen,[699] was extremely fashionable. There were then living here such\r\nnoble and noted persons as Lady Arden, William Perpoint, Esq., Sir Charles\r\nWaldegrave, Lady Fitzharding, Lady Diana Curzon, Serjeant Maynard, Lord\r\nCardigan, Mrs. Anne Heron, Lady Mordant, Richard Adams, Esq., Lady Carr,\r\nLady Wentworth, Mr. Attorney Montagu, Lady Coventry, Judge Welch, and Lady\r\nDavenant.[700]\r\n\r\nMr. Serjeant Maynard was the brave old Presbyterian lawyer, then\r\neighty-seven, who replied to the Prince of Orange, when he said that he\r\nmust have outlived all the men of law of his time--“Sir, I should have\r\noutlived the law itself had not your highness come over.”\r\n\r\nLady Davenant was the widow of Sir William Davenant, the Oxford\r\ninnkeeper’s son, the poet and manager, who, aided by Whitlocke and\r\nMaynard, was allowed in Cromwell’s time to perform operas at a theatre in\r\nCharterhouse Square. After the Restoration he had the theatre in Portugal\r\nStreet. He died in 1668, insolvent. His poems were published by his widow,\r\nand dedicated to the Duke of York in 1673.\r\n\r\nLord Cardigan was the father of the infamous Countess of Shrewsbury, who\r\nis said, disguised as a page, to have held her lover the Duke of\r\nBuckingham’s horse while he killed her husband in a duel near Barn Elms.\r\nThe Earl of Rochester lived in the house next the Duke’s Theatre,[701]\r\nwhich stood behind the present College of Surgeons, as Davenant says in\r\none of his epilogues--\r\n\r\n  “The prospect of the sea cannot be shown,\r\n  Therefore be pleased to think that you are all\r\n  Behind the row which men call Portugal.”\r\n\r\nIn September 1586 Ballard, Babington, and other conspirators against the\r\nlife of Queen Elizabeth were put to death in Lincoln’s Inn Fields.\r\nBabington was a young man of good family, who had been a page to the Earl\r\nof Shrewsbury, and had plotted to rescue Mary and assassinate Elizabeth.\r\nHis plot discovered, he had fled to St. John’s Wood for concealment. Seven\r\nof these plotters were hanged on the first day, and seven on the second.\r\nThe last seven were allowed to die, by special grace, before being\r\ndisembowelled by the executioner.\r\n\r\nIt was through these fields that, one spring night in 1676-7, Thomas\r\nSadler, an impudent and well-known thief, rivalling the audacity of Blood,\r\nhaving with some confederates stolen the mace and purse of Lord Chancellor\r\nFinch from his house in Great Queen Street, bore them in mock procession\r\non their way to their lodgings in Knightrider Street, Doctors’ Commons.\r\nSadler was hanged at Tyburn for this theft.\r\n\r\nLord William Russell was son of William, Earl of Bedford, by Lady Ann\r\nCarr, daughter of Carr, Earl of Somerset. He was beheaded in the centre of\r\nLincoln’s Inn Fields, July 21, 1683, the last year but two of the reign of\r\nKing Charles II., for being, as it was alleged, engaged in a plot to\r\nattack the guards and kill the king, on his return from Newmarket races,\r\nat the Rye House Farm, in a by-road near Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire, about\r\nseventeen miles north-east of London.\r\n\r\nThe Whig party, in their eagerness to restrain the Papists and exclude the\r\nDuke of York from the throne, had gone too far, and their zeal for the\r\nDissenters had produced a violent reaction in the High Church party.\r\nCharles and the Duke, taking advantage of the return tide, began to\r\npersecute the Dissenters, denounce Shaftesbury, assail the liberties of\r\nthe City, and finally dissolved the Parliament. Soon after this, that\r\nsubtle politician, Shaftesbury, finding it impossible to rouse the Duke of\r\nMonmouth, Essex, or Lord Russell, denounced them all as sold and deceived,\r\nand fled to Holland.\r\n\r\nAfter his flight, meetings of his creatures were held at the chambers of\r\none West, an active talking man. Keeling, a vintner of decaying business,\r\nbetrayed the plot, as also did Lord Howard, a man so infamous that Charles\r\nhimself said “he would not hang the worst dog he had upon his evidence.”\r\nKeeling and his brother swore that forty men were hired to intercept the\r\nking, but that a fire at Newmarket, which had hastened Charles’s return,\r\nhad defeated their plans. Goodenough, an ex-sheriff, had told them that\r\nthe Duke of Monmouth and other great men were to raise 4000 soldiers and\r\n£20,000. The brothers also swore that Goodenough had told them that Lord\r\nRussell had joined in the design of killing the king and the duke.\r\n\r\nLord Russell acted with great composure. He would not fly, refused to let\r\nhis friends surrender themselves to share his fortunes, and told an\r\nacquaintance that “he was very sensible he should fall a sacrifice.”[702]\r\nWhen he appeared at the council, the king himself said that “nobody\r\nsuspected Lord Russell of any design against his own person, but that he\r\nhad good evidence of his being in designs against his government.” The\r\nprisoner denied all knowledge of the intended insurrection, or of the\r\nattempt to surprise the guards.\r\n\r\nThe infamous Jeffries was one of the counsel for his prosecution. Lord\r\nRussell argued at his trial, that, allowing he had compassed the king’s\r\ndeath, which he denied, he had been guilty only of a conspiracy to levy\r\nwar, which was not treason except by a recent statute of Charles II., the\r\nprosecutions upon which were limited to a certain time, which had\r\nelapsed,[703] so that both law and justice were in this case violated.\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that Lord Russell was a true patriot, of a slow and\r\nsober judgment, a taciturn, good man, of not the quickest intelligence,\r\nwho had allowed himself to listen to dangerous and random talk for the\r\nsake of political purposes. He wished to debar the duke from the throne,\r\nbut he had never dreamt of accomplishing his purpose by murder. It has\r\nsince been discovered that Sidney, doing evil that good might come, had\r\naccepted secret-service money from France, and that Russell himself had\r\ninterviews with French agents. Lord John Russell explains away this charge\r\nvery well. Charles was degraded enough to take money from France. The\r\npatriots, told that Louis XIV. wished to avoid a war, intrigued with the\r\nFrench king to maintain peace, fearing that if Charles once raised an army\r\nunder any pretence, he would first employ it to obtain absolute power at\r\nhome, which it is most probable he would have done.[704] On the whole,\r\nthese disingenuous interviews must be lamented; they could not and they\r\ndid not lead to good. It has been justly regretted also that Lord Russell\r\non his trial did not boldly denounce the tyranny of the court, and show\r\nthe necessity that had existed for active opposition.\r\n\r\nAfter sentence the condemned man wrote petitions to the king and duke,\r\nwhich were unjustly sneered at as abject. They really, however, contain no\r\npromise but that of living beyond sea and meddling no more in English\r\naffairs. Of one of them at least, Burnet says it was written at the\r\nearnest solicitation of Lady Rachel; and Lord Russell himself said, with\r\nregret, “This will be printed and sold about the streets as my submission\r\nwhen I am led out to be hanged.” He lamented to Burnet that his wife beat\r\nevery bush and ran about so for his preservation; but he acquiesced in\r\nwhat she did when he thought it would be afterwards a mitigation of her\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nWhen his brave and excellent wife, the daughter of Charles I.’s loyal\r\nservant, Southampton, who was the son of Shakspere’s friend, begged for\r\nher husband’s life, the king replied, “How can I grant that man six weeks,\r\nwho would not have granted me six hours?”[705]\r\n\r\nThere is no scene in history that “goes more directly to the heart,” says\r\nFox, “than the story of the last days of this excellent man.” The night\r\nbefore his death it rained hard, and he said, “Such a rain to-morrow will\r\nspoil a great show,” which was a dull thing on a rainy day. He thought a\r\nviolent death only the pain of a minute, not equal to that of drawing a\r\ntooth; and he was still of opinion _that the king was limited by law, and\r\nthat when he broke through those limits, his subjects might defend\r\nthemselves and restrain him_.[706] He then received the sacrament from\r\nTillotson with much devotion, and parted from his wife with a composed\r\nsilence; as soon as she was gone he exclaimed, “The bitterness of death is\r\npast,” saying what a blessing she had been to him, and what a misery it\r\nhad been if she had tried to induce him to turn an informer. He slept\r\nsoundly that night and rose in a few hours, but would take no care in\r\ndressing. He prayed six or seven times by himself, and drank a little tea\r\nand some sherry. He then wound up his watch, and said, “Now I have done\r\nwith time and shall go into eternity.” When told that he should give the\r\nexecutioner ten guineas, he said, with a smile, that it was a pretty thing\r\nto give a fee to have his head cut off. When the sheriffs came at ten\r\no’clock, Lord Russell embraced Lord Cavendish, who had offered to change\r\nclothes with him and stay in his place in prison, or to attack the coach\r\nwith a troop of horse and carry off his friend; but the noble man would\r\nnot listen to either proposal.\r\n\r\nIn the street some in the crowd wept, while others insulted him. He said,\r\n“I hope I shall quickly see a better assembly.” He then sang, half to\r\nhimself, the beginning of the 149th Psalm. As the coach turned into Little\r\nQueen Street, he said, looking at his own house, “I have often turned to\r\nthe one hand with great comfort, but now I turn to this with greater,” and\r\nthen a tear or two fell from his eyes. As they entered Lincoln’s Inn\r\nFields he said, “This has been to me a place of sinning, and God now makes\r\nit the place of my punishment.” When he came to the scaffold, he walked\r\nabout it four or five times: then he prayed by himself, and also with\r\nTillotson; then he partly undressed himself, laid his head down without\r\nany change of countenance, and it was cut off in two strokes. Lord\r\nWilliam’s walking-stick and a cotemporary account of his death are kept at\r\nWoburn Abbey.\r\n\r\nLady Rachel Russell, the excellent wife of this patriot, had been his\r\nsecretary during the trial. She spent her after-life, not in unwisely\r\nlamenting the inevitable past, but in doing good works, and in educating\r\nher children. Writing two months after the execution to Dr. Fritzwilliams,\r\nthis noble woman says:[707] “_Secretly_, my heart mourns and cannot be\r\ncomforted, because I have not the dear companion and sharer of all my joys\r\nand sorrows. I want him to talk with, to walk with, to eat and sleep with.\r\nAll these things are irksome to me now; all company and meals I could\r\navoid, if it might be.... When I see my children before me, I remember\r\nthe pleasure he took in them: this makes my heart shrink.”\r\n\r\nIn 1692 Lady Russell appears to have regained her composure. But she had\r\nother trials in store: for in 1711 she lost her only son, the Duke of\r\nBedford, in the flower of his age, and six months afterwards one of her\r\ndaughters died in childbed.\r\n\r\nIt is said that, in his hour of need, James II. was mean enough to say to\r\nthe Duke of Bedford, “My lord, you are an honest man, have great credit,\r\nand can do me signal service.” “Ah, sir,” replied the duke, with a grave\r\nseverity, “I am old and feeble now, but I once had a _son_.”\r\n\r\nThe Sacheverell riots culminated in these now quiet Fields. In 1710 Daniel\r\nDommaree, a queen’s waterman, Francis Willis, a footman, and George\r\nPurchase, were tried at the Old Bailey for heading a riot during the\r\nSacheverell trial and pulling down meeting-houses. This Sacheverell was an\r\nignorant, impudent incendiary, the adopted son of a Marlborough\r\napothecary, and was impeached by the House of Commons for preaching at St.\r\nAndrew’s, Holborn, sermons denouncing the Revolution of 1688. His sermons\r\nwere ordered to be burnt, and he was sentenced to be suspended for three\r\nyears. Atterbury helped the mischievous firebrand in his ineffectual\r\ndefence, and Swift wrote a most scurrilous letter to Bishop Fleetwood, who\r\nhad lamented the excesses of the mob. Sacheverell had been at Oxford with\r\nAddison, who inscribed a poem to him. During the trial, a mob marched from\r\nthe Temple, whither they had escorted Sacheverell, pulled down Dr.\r\nBurgess’s meeting-house, and threw the pulpit, sconces, and gallery pews\r\ninto a fire in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, some waving curtains on poles,\r\nshouting, “High Church standard!” “Huzza! High Church and Sacheverell!”\r\n“We will have them all down!” They also burnt other meeting-houses in\r\nLeather Lane, Drury Lane, and Fetter Lane, and made bonfires of the\r\nwoodwork in the streets. They were eventually dispersed by the\r\nhorse-grenadiers and horse-guards and foot. Dommaree was sentenced to\r\ndeath, but pardoned; Willis was acquitted; and Purchase was pardoned.[708]\r\n\r\nWooden posts and rails stood round the Fields till 1735, when an Act was\r\npassed to enable the inhabitants to make improvements, to put an iron gate\r\nat each corner, and to erect dwarf walls and iron palisades.[709] Before\r\nthis time grooms used to break in horses on this spot. One day while\r\nlooking at these centaurs, Sir Joseph Jekyll, who had brought a very\r\nobnoxious bill into Parliament in 1736 in order to raise the price of gin,\r\nwas mobbed, thrown down, and dangerously trampled on. His initials, “J.\r\nJ.,” figure under a gibbet chalked on a wall in one of Hogarth’s\r\nprints.[710] Macaulay’s _History_ contains a very highly coloured picture\r\nof these Fields. A comparison of the passage with the facts from which it\r\nis drawn would be a useful lesson to all historical students who love\r\ntruth in its severity.[711]\r\n\r\nNewcastle House stands at the north-west angle of the Fields, at the\r\nsouth-eastern corner of Great Queen Street. It derived its name from John\r\nHolles, Duke of Newcastle, a relative of the noble families of Vere,\r\nCavendish, and Holles. This duke bought the house before 1708, but died in\r\n1711 without issue, and was succeeded in the house by his nephew, the\r\nleader of the Pelham administration under George II.\r\n\r\nThe house had been bought by Lord Powis about 1686. It was built for him\r\nby Captain William Winde, a scholar of Webbe’s, the pupil and executor of\r\nInigo Jones.[712] William Herbert, first Marquis of Powis, was outlawed\r\nand fled to St. Germain’s to James II., who made him Duke of Powis.\r\nGovernment had thought of buying the house when it was inhabited by the\r\nLord Keeper, Sir Nathan Wright,[713] and to have settled it officially on\r\nthe Great Seal. It was once the residence of Sir John Somers, the Lord\r\nChancellor.\r\n\r\nIn 1739 Lady Henrietta Herbert, widow of Lord William Herbert, second son\r\nof the Marquis of Powis, and daughter of James, first Earl of Waldegrave,\r\nwas married to Mr. John Beard,[714] who seems to have been a fine singer\r\nand a most charitable, estimable man. Lady Henrietta’s grandmother was the\r\ndaughter of James II. by the sister of the great Duke of Marlborough. Dr.\r\nBurner speaks of Beard’s great knowledge of music and of his intelligence\r\nas an actor.[715] In an epitaph on him, still extant, the writer says--\r\n\r\n  “Whence had that voice such magic to control?\r\n  ’Twas but the echo of a well-tuned soul;\r\n  Through life his morals and his music ran\r\n  In symphony, and spoke the virtuous man.\r\n  ... Go, gentle harmonist! our hopes approve,\r\n  To meet and hear thy sacred songs above;\r\n  When taught by thee, the stage of life well trod,\r\n  We rise to raptures round the throne of God.”\r\n\r\nBeard, excellent both in oratorios and serious and comic operas, became\r\npart proprietor of Covent Garden Theatre, and died in 1791.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle’s crowded levées were his pleasure and his triumph.\r\nHe generally made people of business wait two or three hours in the\r\nante-chamber while he trifled with insignificant favourites in his closet.\r\nWhen at last he entered the levée room, he accosted, hugged, embraced, and\r\npromised everything to everybody with an assumed cordiality and a\r\ndegrading familiarity.[716]\r\n\r\n“Long” Sir Thomas Robertson was a great intruder on the duke’s time; if\r\ntold that he was out, he would come in to look at the clock or play with\r\nthe monkey, in hopes of the great man relenting. The servants, at last\r\ntired out with Sir Thomas, concocted a formula of repulses, and the next\r\ntime he came the porter, without waiting for his question, began--“Sir,\r\nhis grace is gone out, the fire has gone out, the clock stands, and the\r\nmonkey is dead.”[717]\r\n\r\nSir Timothy Waldo, on his way from the duke’s dinner-table to his own\r\ncarriage, once gave the cook, who was waiting in the hall, a crown. The\r\nrogue returned it, saying he did not take silver. “Oh, don’t you, indeed?”\r\nsaid Sir Timothy, coolly replacing it in his pocket; “then I don’t give\r\ngold.” Jonas Hanway, the great opponent of tea-drinking, published eight\r\nletters to the duke on this subject,[718] and the custom began from that\r\ntime to decline. But Hogarth had already condemned the exaction.\r\n\r\nThe duke was very profuse in his promises, and a good story is told of the\r\nresult of his insincerity. At a Cornish election, the duke had obtained\r\nthe turning vote for his candidate by his usual assurances. The elector,\r\nwishing to secure something definite, had asked for a supervisorship of\r\nexcise for his son-in-law on the present holder’s death. “The moment he\r\ndies,” said the premier, “set out post-haste for London; drive directly to\r\nmy house in the Fields: night or day, sleeping or waking, dead or alive,\r\nthunder at the door; the porter will show you upstairs directly; and the\r\nplace is yours.” A few months after the old supervisor died, and up to\r\nLondon rushed the Cornish elector.\r\n\r\nNow that very night the duke had been expecting news of the death of the\r\nKing of Spain, and had left orders before he went to bed to have the\r\ncourier sent up directly he arrived. The Cornish man, mistaken for this\r\nimportant messenger, was instantly, to his great delight, shown up to the\r\nduke’s bedroom. “Is he dead?--is he dead?” cried the duke. “Yes, my lord,\r\nyes,” answered the aspirant, promptly. “When did he die?” “The day before\r\nyesterday, at half-past one o’clock, after three weeks in his bed, and\r\ntaking a power of doctor’s stuff; and I hope your grace will be as good as\r\nyour word, and let my son-in-law succeed him.” “_Succeed him!_” shouted\r\nthe duke; “is the man drunk or mad? Where are your despatches?” he\r\nexclaimed, tearing back the bed-curtains; and there, to his vexation,\r\nstood the blundering elector, hat in hand, his stupid red face beaming\r\nwith smiles as he kept bowing like a joss. The duke sank back in a\r\nviolent fit of laughter, which, like the electric fluid, was in a moment\r\ncommunicated to his attendants.[719] It is not stated whether the Cornish\r\nman obtained his petition.\r\n\r\nThere is an agreement in all the stories of the duke, who was thirty years\r\nSecretary of State, and nearly ten years First Lord of the Treasury,\r\n“whether told,” says Macaulay, “by people who were perpetually seeing him\r\nin Parliament and attending his levées in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, or by Grub\r\nStreet writers, who had never more than a glimpse of his star through the\r\nwindows of his gilded coach.”[720] Smollett and Walpole mixed in different\r\nsociety, yet they both sketch the duke with the same colours. Smollett’s\r\nNewcastle runs out of his dressing-room with his face covered with\r\nsoapsuds to embrace the Moorish envoy. Walpole’s Newcastle pushes his way\r\ninto the Duke of Grafton’s sick-room to kiss the old nobleman’s plaisters.\r\n“He was a living, moving, talking caricature. His gait was a shuffling\r\ntrot, his utterance a rapid stutter. He was always in a hurry--he was\r\nnever in time; he abounded in fulsome caresses and in hysterical tears.\r\nHis oratory resembled that of Justice Shallow--it was nonsense\r\neffervescent with animal spirits and impertinence. ‘Oh yes, yes, to be\r\nsure--Annapolis must be defended; troops must be sent to Annapolis. Pray,\r\nwhere is Annapolis?’--‘Cape Breton an island! Wonderful! Show it me on the\r\nmap. So it is, sure enough. My dear sir, you always bring us good news. I\r\nmust go and tell the king that Cape Breton is an island.’ His success is a\r\nproof of what may be done by a man who devotes his whole heart and soul to\r\none object. His love of power was so intense a passion, that it almost\r\nsupplied the place of talent. He was jealous even of his own brother.\r\nUnder the guise of levity, he was false beyond all example.” “All the able\r\nmen of his time ridiculed him as a dunce, a driveller, a child, who never\r\nknew his own mind for an hour together, and yet he overreached them all\r\nround.” If the country had remained at peace, this man might have been at\r\nthe head of affairs till a new king came with fresh favourites and a\r\nstrong will; “but the inauspicious commencement of the Seven Years’ War\r\nbrought on a crisis to which Newcastle was altogether unequal. After a\r\ncalm of fifteen years, the spirit of the nation was again stirred to its\r\ninmost depths.”\r\n\r\nThis is strongly etched, but Macaulay was too fond of caricature for a\r\nreal lover of truth. Walpole, recounting this greedy imbecile’s disgrace,\r\nreviews his career much more forcibly, for in a few words he shows us how\r\ngreat had been the power which this chatterer’s fixed purpose had\r\nattained. The memoir-writer describes the duke as the man “who had begun\r\nthe world by heading mobs against the ministers of Queen Anne; who had\r\nbraved the heir-apparent, afterwards George I., and forced himself upon\r\nhim as godfather to his son; who had recovered that prince’s favour, and\r\npreserved power under him, at the expense of every minister whom that\r\nprince preferred; who had been a rival of another Prince of Wales for the\r\nchancellorship of Cambridge; and who was now buffeted from a fourth court\r\nby a very suitable competitor (Lord Bute), and reduced in his tottery old\r\nage to have recourse to those mobs and that popularity which had raised\r\nhim fifty years before.”\r\n\r\nLord Bute was mean enough to compliment the old duke on his retirement.\r\nThe duke replied, with a spirit that showed the vitality of his ambition:\r\n“Yes, yes, my lord, I am an old man, but yesterday was my birthday, and I\r\nrecollected that Cardinal Fleury _began_ to be prime-minister of France\r\njust at my age.”[721]\r\n\r\nNewcastle House, now occupied by the Society for Promoting Christian\r\nKnowledge, was, for forty years or more, inhabited by Sir Alan Chambre,\r\none of King George III.’s judges. The society, then lodged in Bartlett’s\r\nBuildings, in Holborn, derived its first name from that place, and at Sir\r\nAlan’s death they purchased the house and site.\r\n\r\nAbout the centre of the west side of the square, in Sir Alan’s time, lived\r\nthe Earl and Countess of Portsmouth. The earl was half-witted, but was\r\nalways well-conducted and quite producible in society under the guidance\r\nof his countess, a daughter of Lord Grantley.\r\n\r\nNear Surgeons’ Hall, at the same epoch, lived the first Lord Wynford, Lord\r\nChief Justice of the Common Pleas, better known as Serjeant Best. A\r\nquarrel between this irritable lawyer and Serjeant Wilde, afterwards Lord\r\nChancellor Truro, one of the most stalwart gladiators who ever won a name\r\nand title in the legal arena, gave rise to an epigram, the point of which\r\nwas--“That Best was wild, and Wilde was best.”\r\n\r\nIn 1774, when Lord Clive had rewarded Wedderburn, his defender, with lacs\r\nof rupees and a villa at Mitcham, the lawyer had an elegant house in\r\nLincoln’s Inn Fields, not far from the Duke of Newcastle’s,--“a quarter,”\r\nsays Lord Campbell, “which I recollect still the envied resort of legal\r\nmagnates.”\r\n\r\nWedderburn, afterwards better known as Lord Chancellor Loughborough, had a\r\nspecial hatred for Franklin, and loaded him with abuse before a committee\r\nof the Privy Council, for having sent to America letters from the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Massachusetts, urging the Government to employ\r\nmilitary force to suppress the discontents in New England.[722] The effect\r\nof Wedderburn’s brilliant oratory in Parliament was ruined, says Lord\r\nCampbell, by “his character for insincerity.”[723] When George III. heard\r\nof his death, he is reported to have said, “He has not left a greater\r\nknave behind him in my dominions;” upon which Lord Thurlow savagely said,\r\nwith his usual oath, “I perceive that his majesty is quite sane at\r\npresent.” Wedderburn was a friend of David Hume; his humanity was\r\neulogised by Dr. Parr, but he was satirised by Churchill in the _Rosciad_.\r\n\r\nMontague, Earl of Sandwich, the great patron of Pepys, lived in Lincoln’s\r\nInn Fields, paying £250 a year rent.[724] Pepys calls it “a fine house,\r\nbut deadly dear.”[725] He visits him, February 10, 1663-4, and finds my\r\nlord very high and strange and stately, although Pepys had been bound for\r\n£1000 with him, and the shrewd cit naturally enough did not like my lord\r\nbeing angry with him and in debt to him at the same time. The earl was a\r\ndistant cousin of Pepys, and on his marriage received him and his wife\r\ninto his house, and took Pepys with him when he went to bring home Charles\r\nII., when he was elected one of the Council of State and General at Sea.\r\nHe brought the queen-mother to England and took her back again. He also\r\nbrought the ill-fated queen from Portugal, and became a privy-councillor,\r\nand was sent as ambassador to Spain. He seems to have been not untainted\r\nwith the vices of the age. He was in the great battle where Van Tromp was\r\nkilled, and in 1668 he took forty-five sail from the Dutch at sea, and\r\nthat is the best thing known of him. He died in 1672, and was buried in\r\ngreat state.\r\n\r\nInigo Jones built only the west side of the square. No. 55 was the\r\nresidence of Robert Bertie, Earl of Lindsey, a general of King Charles. It\r\nis described in 1708 as a handsome building of the Ionic order, with a\r\nbeautiful and strong Court Gate, formed of six spacious brick piers, with\r\ncurious ironwork between them, and on the piers large and beautiful\r\nvases.[726] The open balustrade at the top bore six urns.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Lindsey was shot at Edgehill in 1642, when a reckless and\r\nintemperate charge of Rupert had led to the total defeat of the\r\nunsupported foot. His son, Lord Willoughby, was taken in endeavouring to\r\nrescue his father. Clarendon describes the earl as a lavish, generous, yet\r\npunctilious man, of great honour and experience in foreign war. He was\r\nsurrounded by Lincolnshire gentlemen, who served in his regiment out of\r\npersonal regard for him. He was jealous of Prince Rupert’s interference,\r\nand had made up his mind to die. As he lay bleeding to death he reproved\r\nthe officers of the Earl of Essex, many of them his old friends, for their\r\ningratitude and “foul rebellion.”[727]\r\n\r\nThe fourth Earl of Lindsey was created Duke of Ancaster, and the house\r\nhenceforward bore that now forgotten name. It was subsequently sold to the\r\nproud Duke of Somerset, the same who married the widow of the Mr. Thynne\r\nwhom Count Königsmarck murdered.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of George III.’s reign Lindsey House became a sort of\r\nlodging-house for foreign members of the Moravian persuasion. The\r\nstaircase, about 1772, was painted with scenes from the history of the\r\nHerrnhuthers. The most conspicuous figures were those of a negro\r\ncatechumen in a white shirt, and a missionary who went over to Algiers to\r\npreach to the galley-slaves, and died in Africa of the plague. There was\r\nalso a painting of a Moravian clergyman being saved from a desert rock on\r\nwhich he had been cast.[728]\r\n\r\nRepeated mention of the Berties is made in Horace Walpole’s pleasant\r\n_Letters_. Lord Robert Bertie was third son of Robert the first Duke of\r\nAncaster and Kesteven. He was a general in the army, a colonel in the\r\nGuards, and a lord of the bedchamber. He married Lady Raymond in 1762, and\r\ndied in 1782.\r\n\r\nThe proud Duke of Somerset, in 1748, left to his eldest daughter, Lady\r\nFrances, married to the Marquis of Granby, three thousand a year, and the\r\nfine house built by Inigo Jones in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, which he had\r\nbought of the Duke of Ancaster for the Duchess, hoping that his daughter\r\nwould let her mother live with her.[729] In July 1779 the Duke of\r\nAncaster, dying of drinking and rioting at two-and-twenty, recalls much\r\nscandal to Walpole’s mind. He had been in love with Lady Honoria,\r\nWalpole’s niece; but Horace does not regret the match dropping through,\r\nfor he says the duke was of a turbulent nature, and, though of a fine\r\nfigure, not noble in manners. Lady Priscilla Elizabeth Bertie, eldest\r\nsister of the duke, married the grandson of Peter Burrell, a merchant, who\r\nbecame husband of the Lady Great Chamberlain of England, and inherited a\r\nbarony and half the Ancaster estate.[730] “The three last duchesses,”\r\ngoes on the cruel gossip, “were never sober.” “The present\r\nduchess-dowager,” he adds, “was natural daughter of Panton, a disreputable\r\nhorse-jockey of Newmarket. The other duchess was some lady’s woman, or\r\nyoung lady’s governess.” Mr. Burrell’s daughters married Lord Percy and\r\nthe Duke of Hamilton.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 Walpole writes to Miss Berry to describe the marriage of Lord\r\nCholmondeley with Lady Georgiana Charlotte Bertie: “The men were in frocks\r\nand white waistcoats. The endowing purse, I believe, has been left off\r\never since broad pieces were called in and melted down. We were but\r\neighteen persons in all.... The poor duchess-mother wept excessively; she\r\nis now left quite alone,--her two daughters married, and her other\r\nchildren dead. She herself, I fear, is in a very dangerous way. She goes\r\ndirectly to Spa, where the new married pair are to meet her. We all\r\nseparated in an hour and a half.”[731]\r\n\r\nAlfred Tennyson in early life had fourth-floor chambers at No. 55, and\r\nthere probably his friend Hallam, whose early death he laments in his _In\r\nMemoriam_ spent many an hour with him. There, in the airy regions of\r\nAttica, in a low-roofed room, the single window of which is darkened by a\r\nhuge stone balustrade--a gloomy relic of past grandeur--the young poet may\r\nhave recited the majestic lines of his “King Arthur,” or the exquisite\r\nlament of “Mariana,” and there he may have immortalised the “plump\r\nhead-waiter of the Cock,” in Fleet Street. Mr. John Foster, the author of\r\nmany sound and delightful historical biographies, had also chambers in\r\nthis house.\r\n\r\nNo. 68, on the west side, stands on the site of the approach to the\r\nstables of old Newcastle House. Here Judge Le Blanc lived, and at his\r\ndeath the house was occupied by Mr. Thomas Le Blanc, Master of Trinity\r\nHall, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nAt No. 33, on the same side as the Insolvent Debtors’ Court, dwelt Judge\r\nPark, a man much beloved by his friends; in his early days, as a young\r\nand poor Scotch barrister, he had lived in Carey Street till his house\r\nthere was burnt down. He used to say that his great ambition in youth had\r\nbeen to one day live at No. 33 in the Fields, at that time occupied by\r\nChief Justice Willis; but in later days, as a judge, leaving the former\r\ngoal of his ambition, he migrated to Bedford Square, where he died.\r\n\r\nNos. 40 and 42, on the south side, form the Museum of the College of\r\nSurgeons, incorporated in 1800. The Grecian front is a most clever\r\ncontrivance by Sir John Soane. The building contains the incomparable\r\nanatomical collection of the eminent John Hunter, bought by the Government\r\nfor £15,000 and given to the College of Surgeons on condition of its being\r\nopened to the public. John Hunter died in 1793; and the first courses of\r\nlectures in the new building were delivered by Sir Everard Home and Sir\r\nWilliam Blizard, in 1810. The Museum was built by Barry in 1835, and cost\r\nabout £40,000.[732] It is divided into two rooms, the normal and abnormal.\r\nThe total number of specimens is upwards of 23,000. The collection is\r\nunequalled in many respects; every article is authentic and in perfect\r\npreservation. The largest human skeleton is that of Charles O’Brien, the\r\nIrish giant, who died in Cockspur Street, Charing Cross, in 1783, aged\r\ntwenty-two. It measures eight feet four inches. By its side, in ghastly\r\ncontrast, is the bony sketch of Caroline Crachami, a Sicilian dwarf who\r\ndied in 1824, aged ten years. There is also a cast of the hand of Patrick\r\nCotter, another Irish giant, who measured eight feet seven and a half\r\ninches. Nor must we overlook the vast framework of Chunee, the elephant\r\nthat went mad with toothache at Exeter Change, and was shot by a company\r\nof riflemen in 1826. The sawn base of the inflamed tusk shows a spicula of\r\nivory pressing into the nervous pulp. Toothache is always terrible, but\r\nonly imagine a square foot of it!\r\n\r\nVery curious too, are the jaw of the extinct sabre-toothed tiger, and the\r\nskeleton of a gigantic extinct Irish deer found under a bed of shell-marl\r\nin a peat bog near Limerick. The antlers are seven feet long, eight feet\r\nacross, and weigh seventy-six pounds. The height of the animal (measured\r\nfrom his skull) was seven feet six inches. Amongst other horrors, there is\r\na cast of the fleshy band that united the Siamese twins, and one of a\r\nwoman with a long curved horn growing from her forehead. There are also\r\nmany skulls of soldiers perforated and torn with bullets, the lead still\r\nadhering to some of the bony plates of the crania. But the wonder of\r\nwonders is the iron pivot of a trysail-mast that was driven clean through\r\nthe chest of a Scarborough lad. The boy recovered in five months, and not\r\nlong after went to work again. It is a tough race that rules the sea.\r\n\r\nThere are also fragments of the skeleton of a rhinoceros discovered in a\r\nlimestone cavern at Oreston during the formation of the Plymouth\r\nBreakwater. In a recess from the gallery stands the embalmed body of the\r\nwife of Martin Van Butchell, an impudent Dutch quack doctor. It is\r\ncoarsely preserved, and is very loathsome to look at. It was prepared in\r\n1775 by Dr. W. Hunter and Mr. Cruikshank, the vascular system being\r\ninjected with oil of turpentine and camphorated spirits of wine, and\r\npowdered nitre and camphor being introduced into the cavities. On the case\r\ncontaining the body is an advertisement cut from an old newspaper, stating\r\nthe conditions which Dr. Van Butchell required of those who came to see\r\nthe body of his wife. At the feet of Mrs. Van Butchell is the shrunken\r\nmummy of her pet parrot.\r\n\r\nThe pictures include the portrait of John Hunter by Reynolds, which Sharp\r\nengraved: it has much faded. There is also a posthumous bust of Hunter by\r\nFlaxman, and one of Clive by Chantrey. Any Fellow of the College can\r\nintroduce a visitor, either personally or by written order, the first four\r\ndays of the week. In September the Museum is closed. It would be much more\r\nconvenient for students if some small sum were charged for admission. It\r\nis now visited but by two or three people a day, when it should be\r\ninspected by hundreds.\r\n\r\nThat great surgeon, John Hunter, was the son of a small farmer in\r\nLanarkshire. He was born in 1728, and died in 1793. In early life he went\r\nabroad as an army-surgeon to study gunshot-wounds; and in 1786 he was\r\nappointed deputy surgeon-general to the army. In 1772 he made discoveries\r\nas to the property of the gastric juice. He was the first to use cutting\r\nas a cure for hydrophobia, and to distinguish the various species of\r\ncancer. He kept at his house at Brompton a variety of wild animals for the\r\npurposes of comparative anatomy, was often in danger from their violence,\r\nand as often saved by his own intrepidity. Sir Joseph Banks divided his\r\ncollection between Hunter and the British Museum. Unequalled in the\r\ndissecting-room, Hunter was a bad lecturer. He was an irritable man, and\r\ndied suddenly during a disputation at St. George’s Hospital which vexed\r\nhim. His death is said to have been hastened by fear of death from\r\nhydrophobia, he having cut his hand while dissecting a man who had died of\r\nthat mysterious disease. Hunter used to call an operation “opprobrium\r\nmedici.”\r\n\r\nIn Portugal Row, as the southern side of the square used to be called,\r\nlived Sir Richard Fanshawe, the translator of the _Lusiad_ of Camoens, and\r\nof Guarini’s _Pastor Fido_. Sir Richard was our ambassador in Spain; but\r\nCharles, wishing to get rid of Lord Sandwich from the navy, recalled\r\nFanshawe, on the plea that he had ventured to sign a treaty without\r\nauthority. He died in 1666, on the intended day of his return, of a\r\nviolent fever, probably caused by vexation at his unmerited disgrace. Sir\r\nRichard appears to have been a religious, faithful man and a good scholar,\r\nbut born in unhappy times and to an ill fate. Charles I. had very justly a\r\ngreat respect for him. His wife was a brave, determined woman, full of\r\naffection, good sense, and equally full of hatred and contempt for Lord\r\nSandwich, Pepys’s friend, who had supplanted her husband in the embassy.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, on their way to Malaga, the Dutch trading vessel in which\r\nshe and her husband were was threatened by a Turkish galley which bore\r\ndown on them in full sail. The captain, who had rendered his sixty guns\r\nuseless by lumbering them up with cargo, resolved to fight for his £30,000\r\nworth of goods, and therefore armed his two hundred men and plied them\r\nwith brandy. The decks were partially cleared, and the women ordered below\r\nfor fear the Turks might think the vessel a merchant-ship and board it.\r\nSir Richard, taking his gun, bandolier, and sword, stood with the ship’s\r\ncompany waiting for the Turks.[733] But we must quote the brave wife’s own\r\nsimple words:--“The beast the captain had locked me up in the cabin. I\r\nknocked and called long to no purpose, until at length the cabin-boy came\r\nand opened the door. I, all in tears, desired him to be so good as to give\r\nme the blue thrum cap he wore and his tarred coat, which he did, and I\r\ngave him half-a-crown; and putting them on, and flinging away my\r\nnight-clothes, I crept up softly and stood upon the deck by my husband’s\r\nside, as free from fear as, I confess, from discretion; but it was the\r\neffect of that passion which I could never master. By this time the two\r\nvessels were engaged in parley, and so well satisfied with speech and\r\nsight of each other’s forces, that the Turks’ man-of-war tacked about and\r\nwe continued our course. But when your father saw me retreat, looking upon\r\nme, he blessed himself and snatched me up in his arms, saying, ‘Good God!\r\nthat love can make this change!’ and though he seemingly chid me, he would\r\nlaugh at it as often as he remembered that journey.” This same vessel, a\r\nshort time after, was blown up in the harbour with the loss of more than a\r\nhundred men and all the lading.[734]\r\n\r\nThis brave, good woman showed still greater fortitude when her husband\r\ndied and left her almost penniless in a strange country. She had only\r\ntwenty-eight doubloons with which to bring home her children, and sixty\r\nservants, and the dead body of her husband. She, however, instantly sold\r\nher carriages and a thousand pounds’ worth of plate, and setting apart the\r\nqueen’s present of two thousand doubloons for travelling expenses, started\r\nfor England. “God,” she says, in her brave, pious way, “did hear, and\r\nsee, and help me, and brought my soul out of trouble.”\r\n\r\nIn 1677 Lady Fanshawe took a house in Holborn Row, the north side of the\r\nsquare, and spent a year lamenting “the dear remembrances of her past\r\nhappiness and fortune; and though she had great graces and favours from\r\nthe king and queen and whole court, yet she found at the present no\r\nremedy.”[735]\r\n\r\nLord Kenyon lived at No. 35 in 1805. Jekyll was fond of joking about\r\nKenyon’s stinginess, and used to say he died of eating apple-pie crust at\r\nbreakfast to save the expense of muffins; and that Lord Ellenborough, who\r\nsucceeded on Kenyon’s death to the Chief Justiceship, always used to bow\r\nto apple-pie ever afterwards which Jekyll called his “apple-pie-ety.” The\r\nprincesses Augusta and Sophia once told Tom Moore, at Lady Donegall’s that\r\nthe king used to play tricks on Kenyon and send the despatch-box to him at\r\na quarter past seven, when it was known the learned lord was in bed to\r\nsave candlelight.[736] Lord Ellenborough used to say that the final word\r\nin “Mors janua vitæ” was mis-spelled _vita_ on Kenyon’s tomb to save the\r\nextra cost of the diphthong.[737] George III. used to say to Kenyon, “My\r\nLord, let us have a little more of your good law, and less of your bad\r\nLatin.”\r\n\r\nLord Campbell, who gives a very pleasant sketch of Chief Justice Kenyon,\r\nwith his bad temper and bad Latin, his hatred of newspaper writers and\r\ngamblers, and his wrath against pettifoggers, describes his being taken in\r\nby Horne Tooke, and laughs at his ignorantly-mixed metaphors. He seems to\r\nhave been a respectable second-rate lawyer, conscientious and upright. “He\r\noccupied,” says Lord Campbell, “a large gloomy house, in which I have seen\r\nmerry doings when it was afterwards transferred to the Verulam Club.” The\r\ntradition of this house was that “it was always Lent in the kitchen and\r\nPassion Week in the parlour.” On some one mentioning the spits in Lord\r\nKenyon’s kitchen, Jekyll said, “It is irrelevant to talk about the spits,\r\nfor nothing _turns_ upon them.” The judge’s ignorance was profound. It is\r\nreported that in a trial for blasphemy the Chief Justice, after citing the\r\nnames of several remarkable early Christians, said, “Above all, gentlemen,\r\nneed I name to you the Emperor Julian, who was so celebrated for the\r\npractice of every Christian virtue that he was called Julian the\r\nApostle?”[738] On another occasion, talking of a false witness, he is\r\nsupposed to have said, “The allegation is as far from truth as ‘old\r\nBoterium from the northern main’--a line I have heard or met with, God\r\nknows where.”[739]\r\n\r\nLord Erskine lived at No. 36, in 1805, the year before he rose at once to\r\nthe peerage and the woolsack, and presided at Lord Melville’s trial. He\r\ndid not hold the seals many months, and died in 1823. This great Whig\r\norator was the youngest son of the Earl of Buchan. He was a midshipman and\r\nan ensign before he became a student at Lincoln’s Inn. He began to be\r\nknown in 1778; in 1781 he defended Lord George Gordon, in 1794 Horne\r\nTooke, Hardy, Thelwall, and afterwards Tom Paine.\r\n\r\nThe house that contains the Soane Museum, No. 13 on the north side, was\r\nbuilt in 1812, and, consisting of twenty-four small apartments crammed\r\nwith curiosities, is in itself a marvel of fantastic ingenuity. Every inch\r\nof space is turned to account. On one side of the picture-room are\r\ncabinets, and on the other movable shutters or screens, on which pictures\r\nare also hung; so that a small area, only thirteen feet long and twelve\r\nbroad, contains as much as a gallery forty-five feet long and twenty feet\r\nbroad. A Roman altar once stood in the outer court.\r\n\r\nIt is a disgrace to the trustees that this curious museum is kept so\r\nprivate, and that such impediments are thrown in the way of visitors. It\r\nis open only two days a week in April, May, and June, but at certain\r\nseasons a third day is granted to foreigners, artists, and people from the\r\ncountry. To obtain tickets, you are obliged to get, some days before you\r\nvisit, a letter from a trustee, or to write to the curator, enter your\r\nname in a book, and leave your card. All this vexatious hindrance and\r\nfuss has the desired effect of preventing many persons from visiting a\r\nmuseum left, not to the trustees or the curator, but to the nation--to\r\nevery Englishman. In order to read the books, copy the pictures, or\r\nexamine the plans and drawings, the same tedious and humiliating form must\r\nbe gone through.\r\n\r\nThe gem of all the Soane treasures is an enormous transparent alabaster\r\nsarcophagus, discovered by Belzoni in 1816 in a tomb in the valley of\r\nBeban el Molook, near Thebes. It is nine feet four inches long, three feet\r\neight inches wide, two feet eight inches deep, and is covered without and\r\nwithin with beautifully-cut hieroglyphics. It was the greatest discovery\r\nof the runaway Paduan Monk, and was undoubtedly the cenotaph or\r\nsarcophagus of a Pharaoh or Ptolemy. It was discovered in an enormous tomb\r\nof endless chambers, which the Arabs still call “Belzoni’s tomb.” On the\r\nbottom of the case is a full-length figure in relief, of Isis, the\r\nguardian of the dead. Sir John Soane gave £2000 for this sarcophagus to\r\nMr. Salt, Consul General of Egypt and Belzoni’s employer. The raised lid\r\nis broken into nineteen pieces. The late Sir Gardner Wilkinson considered\r\nthis to be the cenotaph of Osirei, the father of Rameses the Great. But\r\nthe forgotten king for whom the Soane sarcophagus was really executed was\r\nSeti, surnamed Meni-en-Ptah, the father of Rameses the Great; he is called\r\nby Manetho Séthos.[740] Dr. Lepsius dates the commencement of his reign\r\nB.C. 1439. Dr. Brugsch places it twenty years earlier. Mr. Sharpe, with\r\nthat delightful uncertainty characteristic of Egyptian antiquaries, drags\r\nthe epoch down two hundred years later. Seti was the father of the Pharaoh\r\nwho persecuted the Israelites, and he made war against Syria. His son was\r\nthe famous Rameses. All three kings were descended from the Shepherd\r\nChiefs. The most beautiful fragment in Karnak represents this monarch,\r\nSeti, in his chariot, with a sword like a fish-slice in one hand, while in\r\nthe other he clutches the topknots of a group of conquered enemies,\r\nNubian, Syrian, and Jewish. The work is full of an almost Raphaelesque\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nAfter this come some of Flaxman’s and Banks’s sketches and models, a cast\r\nof the shield of Achilles by the former, and one of the Boothby monument\r\nby the latter. There is also a fine collection of ancient gems and\r\nintaglios, pure in taste and exquisitely cut, and a set of the Napoleon\r\nmedals, selected by Denon for the Empress Josephine, and in the finest\r\npossible state. We may also mention Sir Christopher Wren’s watch, some\r\nivory chairs, and a table from Tippoo Saib’s devastated palace at\r\nSeringapatam, and a richly-mounted pistol taken by Peter the Great from a\r\nTurkish general at Azof in 1696. The latter was given to Napoleon by the\r\nRussian emperor at the treaty of Tilsit in 1807, and was presented by him\r\nto a French officer at St. Helena. The books, too, are of great interest.\r\nHere is the original MS. copy of the _Gierusalemme Liberata_, published at\r\nFerrara in 1581, and in Tasso’s own handwriting; the first four folio\r\neditions of Shakspere, once the property of that great actor and\r\nShaksperean student John Philip Kemble; a folio of designs for Elizabethan\r\nand Jacobean houses by the celebrated architect John Thorpe; Fauntleroy\r\nthe forger’s illustrated copy of Pennant’s _London_, purchased for six\r\nhundred and fifty guineas; a Commentary on Paul’s Epistles, illuminated by\r\nthe laborious Croatian, Giulio Clovio (who died in 1578), for Cardinal\r\nGrimani. Vasari raves about the minute finish of this painter.\r\n\r\nThe pictures, too, are good. There are three Canalettis full of that Dutch\r\nVenetian’s clear common sense; the finest, a view on the Grand Canal--his\r\nfavourite subject--and “The Snake in the Grass,” better known as “Love\r\nunloosing the Zone of Beauty,” by Reynolds. There is a sadly faded replica\r\nof this in the Winter Palace at St. Petersburg. This one was purchased at\r\nthe Marchioness of Thomond’s sale for £500. The “Rake’s Progress,” by\r\nHogarth, in eight pictures, was purchased by Sir John in 1802 for £598.\r\nThese inimitable pictures are incomparable, and display the fine, pure,\r\nsober colour of the great artist, and his broad touch so like that of Jan\r\nSteen.\r\n\r\nThe Soane collection also boasts of Hogarth’s four “Election” pictures,\r\npurchased at Garrick’s sale for £1732 10s. They are rather dark in tone.\r\nThere is also a fine but curious Turner, “Van Tromp’s Barge entering the\r\nTexel;” a portrait by Goma of Napoleon in 1797, when emaciated and\r\nhaggard, and a fine miniature of him in 1814, when fat and already on the\r\ndecline, both physically and mentally, by Isabey the great\r\nminiature-painter, taken at Elba in 1814. In the dining-room is a portrait\r\nof Soane by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and in the gallery under the dome a bust\r\nof him by Chantrey.\r\n\r\nSir John Soane was the son of a humble Reading bricklayer, and brought up\r\nin Mr. Dance’s office. Carrying off a gold and silver medal at the\r\nAcademy, he was sent as travelling student to Rome. In 1791 he obtained a\r\nGovernment employment, in 1800 enlarged the Bank of England, and in 1806\r\nbecame Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy. He built the\r\nDulwich Gallery, and in 1826 the Masonic Hall in Great Queen Street. In\r\n1827 he gave £1000 to the Duke of York’s monument. At the close of his\r\nlife he left his collection of works of art, valued at £50,000, to the\r\nnation, and died in 1837,[741] leaving his son penniless. In 1835 the\r\nEnglish architects presented Sir John with a splendid medal in token of\r\ntheir approbation of his conduct and talents.\r\n\r\nThe Literary Fund Society, instituted in 1790, and incorporated in 1818,\r\nhad formerly rooms at No. 4 Lincoln’s Inn Fields. The society was\r\nestablished in order to aid authors of merit and good character who might\r\nbe reduced to poverty by unavoidable circumstances, or be deprived of the\r\npower of exertion by enfeebled faculties or old age. George IV. and\r\nWilliam IV. both contributed one hundred guineas a year to its funds, and\r\nthis subscription is continued by our present Queen. The society\r\ndistributed £1407 in 1846. The average annual amount of subscriptions and\r\ndonations is about £1100. The Literary Fund Society moved afterwards to\r\n73 Great Russell Street. Some years ago a split occurred in this society.\r\nCharles Dickens and Mr. C. W. Dilke, the proprietor of the _Athenæum_,\r\nobjecting to the wasteful expense of the management, seceded from it; the\r\nresult of this secession was the founding of the Guild of Literature, and\r\nthe collection of £4000 by means of private theatricals--a sum which,\r\nunfortunately, still lies partly dormant. The Fund is now domiciled in\r\nBloomsbury.\r\n\r\nBoth Pepys and Evelyn praise the house of Mr. Povey in Lincoln’s Inn\r\nFields as a prodigy of elegant comfort and ingenuity. The marqueterie\r\nfloors, “the perspective picture in the little closet,” the grotto\r\ncellars, with a well for the wine, the fountains and imitation porphyry\r\nvases, his pictures and the bath at the top of the house, seem to have\r\nbeen the abstract of all luxurious ease.\r\n\r\nNames were first put on doors in London in 1760, some years before the\r\nstreet-signs were removed. In 1764 houses were first numbered; the\r\nnumbering commenced in New Burlington Street, and Lincoln’s Inn Fields was\r\nthe second place numbered.\r\n\r\nIn Carey Street lived that excellent woman Mrs. Hester Chapone, who\r\nafterwards removed to Arundel Street. She was a friend of Mrs. Carter, who\r\ntranslated Epictetus, and of Mrs. Montagu, the Queen of the Blue\r\nStockings. She was one of the female admirers who thronged round\r\nRichardson the novelist, and she married a young Templar whom he had\r\nintroduced to her. It was a love match, and she had the misfortune of\r\nlosing him in less than ten months after their marriage. Her celebrated\r\nletters on _The Improvement of the Mind_, published in 1773, were written\r\nfor a favourite niece, who married a Westminster Clergyman and died in\r\nchildbed. Though Mrs. Chapone’s letters are now rather dry and\r\nold-fashioned, reminding us of the backboards of a too punctilious age,\r\nthey contain some sensible and well-expressed thoughts. Here is a sound\r\npassage:--“Those ladies who pique themselves on the particular excellence\r\nof neatness are very apt to forget that the decent order of the house\r\nshould be designed to promote the convenience and pleasure of those who\r\nare to be in it; and that if it is converted into a cause of trouble and\r\nconstraint, their husbands’ guests would be happier without it.”[742]\r\n\r\nGibbons’s Tennis Court stood in Vere Street, Clare Market; it was turned\r\ninto a theatre by Thomas Killigrew. Ogilby the poet, started a lottery of\r\nbooks at “the old theatre” in June 1668. He describes the books in his\r\nadvertisements as “all of his own designment and composure.”\r\n\r\n“The Duke’s Theatre” stood in Portugal Street, at the back of Portugal\r\nRow. It was pulled down in 1835 to make room for the enlargement of the\r\nMuseum of the College of Surgeons. Before that it had been the china\r\nwarehouse of Messrs. Spode and Copeland.[743] There had been, however,\r\nfrailer things than china in the house in Pepys’s time. Here, the year of\r\nthe Restoration, came Killigrew with the actors from the Red Bull,\r\nClerkenwell, and took the name of the King’s Company. Three years later\r\nthey moved to Drury Lane. Davenant’s company then came to Portugal Street\r\nin 1662, deserting their theatre, once a granary, in Salisbury Court. They\r\nplayed here till 1671, when they returned to their old theatre, then\r\nrenovated under the management of Charles Davenant and the celebrated\r\nBetterton, the great tragedian. They afterwards united in Drury Lane, and\r\nagain fell apart. In 1695 a company, headed by Betterton, with Congreve\r\nfor a partner, re-opened the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. It then\r\nbecame celebrated for pantomimes under Rich, the excellent harlequin. On\r\nhis removal to Covent Garden it was deserted, re-opened by Gifford from\r\nGoodman’s Fields, and finally ceased to be a theatre about 1737, so that\r\nits whole life did not extend to more than one generation.\r\n\r\nActresses first appeared in London in Prynne’s time. Soon after the\r\nRestoration a lady of Killigrew’s company took the part of Desdemona. In\r\nJanuary 1661 Pepys saw women on the stage at the Cockpit Theatre: the play\r\nwas Beaumont and Fletcher’s “Beggars’ Bush.” The prologue to “Othello” in\r\n1660 contains the following line:[744]--\r\n\r\n  “Our women are defective and so sized,\r\n  You’d think they were some of the guard disguised;\r\n  For, to speak truth, men act that are between\r\n  Forty and fifty, wenches of fifteen,\r\n  With bone so large, and nerve so uncompliant,\r\n  That, when you call Desdemona, enter giant.”\r\n\r\nThe Puritans were now happily in the minority, and so the attempt\r\nsucceeded. Davenant did not bring forward his actresses till June 1661,\r\nwhen he produced his “Siege of Rhodes.” Kynaston, Hart, Burt, and Clun,\r\nfamous actors of Charles II.’s time, were all excellent representatives of\r\nfemale characters.\r\n\r\nIt was at the Duke’s Theatre, in 1680, that Nell Gwynn who was present,\r\nbeing reviled by one of the audience, and William Herbert, who had married\r\na sister of one of the king’s mistresses, taking up Nell’s quarrel--a\r\nsword fight took place between the two factions in the house. This\r\nhot-blooded young gallant Herbert grew up to be Earl of Pembroke and first\r\nplenipotentiary at Ryswick.\r\n\r\nThe chief ladies at the Duke’s House were Mrs. Davenport, Mrs. Davies, and\r\nMrs. Saunderson. The first of these ladies, generally known as “Roxalana,”\r\nfrom a character of that name in the “Siege of Rhodes,” resisted for a\r\nlong time the addresses of Aubrey de Vere, the last Earl of Oxford, a\r\nwicked brawling roysterer, and a disgrace to his name, who at last\r\nobtained her hand by the cruel deception of a sham marriage. The pretended\r\npriest was a trumpeter, the witness a kettle-drummer in the king’s\r\nregiment. The poor creature threw herself in vain at the king’s feet and\r\ndemanded justice, but gradually grew more composed upon an annuity of a\r\nthousand crowns a year.[745]\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs. Davies, who danced well and played ill, she won the\r\nsusceptible heart of Charles II. by her singing the song, “My lodging is\r\non the cold, cold ground.” “Through the marriage of the daughter of Lord\r\nDerwentwater with the eighth Lord Petre,” says Dr. Doran, “the blood of\r\nthe Stuarts and of Moll Davies still runs in their lineal descendant, the\r\npresent and twelfth lord.”[746]\r\n\r\nMrs. Saunderson became the excellent wife of the great actor Betterton.\r\nFor about thirty years she played the chief female characters, especially\r\nin Shakspere’s plays, with great success. She taught Queen Anne and her\r\nsister Mary elocution, and after her husband’s death received a pension of\r\n£500 a year from her royal pupil.\r\n\r\nIn 1664 Pepys went to Portugal Street to see that clever but impudent\r\nimpostor, the German Princess, appear after her acquittal at the Old\r\nBailey for inveigling a young citizen into a marriage, acting her own\r\ncharacter in a comedy immortalising her exploit.\r\n\r\nIn February 1666-7 Pepys goes again to the Duke’s Playhouse, and observes\r\nthere Rochester the wit and Mrs. Stewart, afterwards Duchess of Richmond,\r\nthe same lady whose portrait we retain as Britannia on the old\r\nhalfpennies. “It was pleasant,” says the tuft-hunting gossip, “to see how\r\neverybody rose up when my Lord John Butler, the Duke of Ormond’s son, came\r\ninto the pit, towards the end of the play, who was a servant to Mrs.\r\nMallett, and now smiled upon her and she on him.”[747]\r\n\r\nThe same month, 1667-8, Pepys revisits the Duke’s House to see Etherege’s\r\nnew play, “She Would if She Could.” He was there by two o’clock, and yet\r\nalready a thousand people had been refused at the pit. The fussy\r\npublic-office man, not being able to find his wife, who was there, got\r\ninto an eighteenpenny box, and could hardly see or hear. The play done, it\r\nbeing dark and rainy, Pepys stays in the pit looking for his wife and\r\nwaiting for the weather to clear up. And there for an hour and a half sat\r\nalso the Duke of Buckingham, Sedley, and Etherege talking; all abusing the\r\nplay as silly, dull, and insipid, except the author, who complained of the\r\nactors for not knowing their parts.\r\n\r\nIn May 1668 Pepys is again at this theatre in the balcony box, where sit\r\nthe shameless Lady Castlemaine and her ladies and women; on another\r\noccasion he sits below the same group, and sees the proud lady look like\r\nfire when Moll Davies ogles the king her lover. In another place he\r\nobserves how full the pit is, though the seats are two shillings and\r\nsixpence a piece, whereas in his youth he had never gone higher than\r\ntwelvepence or eighteenpence.[748]\r\n\r\nKynaston, the greatest of the “boy-actresses,” was chiefly on this stage\r\nfrom 1659 to 1699. Evadne was his favourite female part. Later in life he\r\ntook to heroic characters. Cibber says of him: “He had something of a\r\nformal gravity in his mien, which was attributed to the stately step he\r\nhad been so early confined to. But even that in characters of superiority\r\nhad its proper graces; it misbecame him not in the part of Leon in\r\nFletcher’s ‘Rule a Wife,’ which he executed with a determined manliness\r\nand honest authority. He had a piercing eye, and in characters of heroic\r\nlife a quick imperious vivacity in his tone of voice that painted the\r\ntyrant truly terrible. There were two plays of Dryden in which he shone\r\nwith uncommon lustre; in ‘Arungzebe,’ he played Morat, and in ‘Don\r\nSebastian’ Muley Moloch. In both these parts he had a fierce lion-like\r\nmajesty in his port and utterance that gave the spectator a kind of\r\ntrembling admiration.”[749] Kynaston died in 1712, and left a fortune to\r\nhis son, a mercer in Covent Garden, whose son became rector of Aldgate.\r\n\r\nJames Nokes was Kynaston’s contemporary in Portugal Street. Leigh Hunt\r\ncalls him something between Liston and Munden. Dryden mentions him, in a\r\npolitical epistle to Southerne, as indispensable to a play. Cibber says,\r\n“The ridiculous solemnity of his features was enough to have set the whole\r\nbench of Bishops into a titter.” In his ludicrous distresses he sank into\r\nsuch piteous pusilanimity that one almost pitied him. “When he debated any\r\nmatter by himself he would shut up his mouth with a dumb, studious pout,\r\nand roll his full eye into a vacant amazement.”[750] He died in 1692,\r\nleaving a fortune and an estate near Barnet.\r\n\r\nBut the great star of Portugal Street was Betterton, the Garrick of his\r\nage. His most admired part was Hamlet; but Steele especially dilates on\r\nhis Othello. He acted his Hamlet from traditions handed down by Davenant\r\nof Taylor, whom Shakspere himself is said to have instructed. Cibber says\r\nthat there was such enchantment in his voice alone that no one cared for\r\nthe sense of the words; and he adds, “I never heard a line in tragedy come\r\nfrom Betterton wherein my judgment, my ear, and my imagination, were not\r\nfully satisfied.” This great man, who created no fewer than 130\r\ncharacters, was a friend of Dryden, Pope, and Tillotson. Kneller’s\r\nportrait of him is at Knowle;[751] A copy of it by Pope is preserved in\r\nLord Mansfield’s gallery at Caen Wood. When he died, in 1710, Steele wrote\r\na “Tatler” upon him, in which he says “he laboured incessantly, and lived\r\nirreproachably. He was the jewel of the English stage.” He killed himself\r\nby driving back the gout in order to perform on his benefit night, and his\r\nwidow went mad from grief. Betterton acted as Colonel Jolly in Colman’s\r\n“Cutter of Coleman Street,” as Jaffier in Otway’s _chef d’œuvre_, as fine\r\ngentlemen in Congreve’s vicious but gay comedies, as a hero in Rowe’s\r\nflatulent plays, and as Sir John Brute in Vanbrugh’s great comedy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barry was one of the best actresses in Portugal Street. She was the\r\ndaughter of an old Cavalier colonel, and was instructed for the stage by\r\nRochester, whose mistress she became. Dryden pronounced her the best\r\nactress he had ever seen. Her face and colour varied with each passion,\r\nwhether heroic or tender. “Her mien and motion,” says Cibber, “were superb\r\nand gracefully majestic, her voice full, clear, and strong.” In scenes of\r\nanger, defiance, or resentment, while she was impetuous and terrible, she\r\npoured out the sentiment with an enchanting harmony. She was so versatile\r\nthat she played Lady Brute as well as Zara or Belvidera. For her King\r\nJames II. originated the custom of actors’ benefits. After a career of\r\nthirty-eight years on the boards, she died at Acton in 1713. Kneller’s\r\npicture represents her with beautiful eyes, fine hair drawn back from her\r\nforehead, “the face full, fair, and rippling with intellect,”[752] but her\r\nmouth a little awry.[753]\r\n\r\nMrs. Mountfort also appeared in Portugal Street before the two companies\r\nunited at Drury Lane in 1682. She was the best of male coxcombs, stage\r\ncoquettes, and country dowdies, a vivacious mimic, and of the most\r\nversatile humour. Cibber sketches her admirably as Melantha in “Marriage à\r\nla Mode:”--“She is a fluttering, finished impertinent, with a whole\r\nartillery of airs, eyes, and motions. When the gallant recommended by her\r\nfather brings his letter of introduction, down goes her dainty diving body\r\nto the ground, as if she were sinking under the conscious load of her own\r\nattractions; then she launches into a flood of fine language and\r\ncompliment, still playing her chest forward in fifty falls, and rising\r\nlike a swan upon waving water; and to complete her impertinence, she is so\r\nrapidly fond of her own wit that she will not give her lover leave to\r\npraise it;[754] and at last she swims from him with a promise to return in\r\na twinkling.”\r\n\r\nThe virtuous, good, and discreet Mrs. Bracegirdle was another favourite in\r\nPortugal Street. For her Congreve, who affected to be her lover, wrote his\r\nAraminta and Cynthia, his Angelica, his Almeria, and his Millamant in “The\r\nway of the world.” All the town was in love with her youth, cheerful\r\ngaiety, musical voice, the happy graces of her manner, her dark eyes,\r\nbrown hair, and expressive, rosy-brown face. Her Statira justified Nat\r\nLee’s frantic Alexander for all his rant; and “when she acted Millamant,\r\nall the faults, follies, and affectation of that agreeable tyrant were\r\nvenially melted down into so many charms and attractions of a conscious\r\nbeauty.” Mrs. Bracegirdle was on the stage from 1680 to 1707. She lived\r\nlong enough to warn Cibber against envy of Garrick, and died in 1748.\r\n\r\nThree of Congreve’s plays, “Love for Love,” “The Mourning Bride,” and “The\r\nWay of the World,” came out in Portugal Street. Steele, in the _Tatler_,\r\nNo. 1, mentions “Love for Love” as being acted for Betterton’s\r\nbenefit--Mrs. Barry, Mrs. Bracegirdle, and Doggett taking parts. He\r\ndescribes the stage as covered with gentlemen and ladies, “so that when\r\nthe curtain was drawn it discovered even there a very splendid audience.”\r\n“In Dryden’s time,” says Steele, “You used to see songs, epigrams, and\r\nsatires in the hands of every person you met [at the theatre]; now you\r\nhave only a pack of cards, and instead of the cavils about the turn of the\r\nexpression, the elegance of style and the like, the learned now dispute\r\nonly about the truth of the game.”\r\n\r\nPoor Mountfort, the most handsome, graceful, and ardent of stage lovers,\r\nthe most admirable of courtly fops, and the best dancer and singer of the\r\nday, strutted his little hour in Portugal Street till run through the body\r\nby Lord Mohun’s infamous boon companion. His career extended from 1682 to\r\n1695. He was only thirty-three when he died.\r\n\r\nThe last proprietor of the theatre was Rich, an actor who, failing in\r\ntragedy, turned harlequin and manager, and became celebrated for producing\r\nspectacles, ballets, and pantomimes. Under the name of Lun he revelled as\r\nharlequin, and was admirable in a scene where he was hatched from an egg.\r\n\r\nPope, always sore about theatrical matters, describes this manager’s\r\npompousness in the _Dunciad_ (book iii.):--\r\n\r\n                          “At ease\r\n  ’Midst storm of paper fierce hail of pease,\r\n  And proud his mistress’ order to perform,\r\n  Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.”\r\n\r\nRich’s great success was the production of Gay’s _Beggars’ Opera_ in\r\n1727-8. This piece brought £2000 to the author, and for a time drove the\r\nItalian Opera into the shade. It ran sixty-three nights the first season,\r\nand then spread to all the great towns in Great Britain. Ladies carried\r\nabout the favourite songs engraved on their fan-mounts, and they were also\r\nprinted on fire-screens and other furniture. Miss Lavinia Fenton, who\r\nacted Polly, became the idol of the town; engravings of her were sold by\r\nthousands: her life was written, and collections were made of her\r\njests.[755] Eventually she married the Duke of Bolton. Sir Robert Walpole\r\nlaughed at the satire against himself, and “Gay grew rich, and Rich gay,”\r\nas the popular epigram went. Hogarth drew the chief scene with Walker as\r\nMacheath, and Spiller as Mat o’ the Mint. Swift was vexed to find his\r\nGulliver for the time forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe custom of allowing young men of fashion to have chairs upon the stage\r\nwas an intolerable nuisance to the actors before Garrick. In 1721 it led\r\nto a desperate riot at the Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theatre. Half-a-dozen\r\nbeaux, headed by a tipsy earl, were gathered round the wings, when the\r\nearl reeled across the stage where Macbeth and his lady were then acting,\r\nto speak to a boon companion at the opposite side. Rich the manager, vexed\r\nat the interruption, forbade the earl the house, upon which the earl\r\nstruck Rich and Rich the earl. Half-a-dozen swords at once sprang out and\r\ndecreed that Rich must die; but Quin and his brother actors rushed to the\r\nrescue with bare blades, charged the coxcombs, and drove them through the\r\nstage-door into the kennel. The beaux returning to the front, rushed into\r\nthe boxes, broke the sconces, slashed the hangings, and threatened to burn\r\nthe house; upon which doughty Quin and a party of constables and watchmen\r\nflung themselves on the rioters and haled them to prison. The actors,\r\nintimidated, refused to re-open the house till the king granted them a\r\nguard of soldiers, a custom that has not long been discontinued. It was\r\nnot till 1780 that the habit of admitting the vulgar, noisy, and turbulent\r\nfootmen gratis was abandoned.[756]\r\n\r\nMacklin, afterwards the inimitable Shylock and Sir Pertinax, played small\r\nparts at Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theatre till 1731, when a short speech as\r\nBrazencourt, in Fielding’s “Coffee-house Politicians,” betrayed the true\r\nactor. He lived till over a hundred, so long that he did not leave Covent\r\nGarden till after Braham’s appearance, and Braham many of our elder\r\nreaders have seen.[757]\r\n\r\nMacklin, an Irishman, and in early life a Dragoon officer, was irritable,\r\nrestless, and pugnacious; he obtained his first triumph at Drury Lane, as\r\nShylock in 1741. In stern malignity, no one has surpassed Macklin. His\r\nacting was hard, but manly and weighty, though his features were rather\r\nrigid. He naturally condemned Garrick’s action and gesture as\r\nsuperabundant. His Sir Pertinax was excellent in its sly and deadly\r\nsuppleness. He was also admirable in Lovegold, Scrub, Peachem, Polonius,\r\nand many Irish characters.\r\n\r\nQuin was at Portugal Street as early as 1718-19. There he first “delighted\r\nthe town by his chivalry as Hotspur, his bluntness as Clytus, his\r\nfieriness as Bajazet, his grandeur as Macbeth, his calm dignity as Brutus,\r\nhis unctuousness as Falstaff, his duplicity as Maskwell, and his coarse\r\ndrollery as Sir John Brute.”[758] It was just before this, that locked in\r\na room and compelled to fight, he had killed Bowen, who was jealous of his\r\nacting as Bajazet. When Rich refused to give Quin more than £300 a year,\r\nhe joined the Drury Lane company, where he instantly got £500 per annum.\r\n\r\nWhen Rich grew wealthy enough to hire a new theatre in Covent Garden, he\r\nleft Portugal Street. Almost the last play acted there was “The\r\nAnatomist,” by Ravenscroft, a second-rate author of Dryden’s time.\r\n\r\nThe mob attributed the flight of Rich from the old theatre to the\r\nappearance of a devil during the performance of the pantomime of\r\n“Harlequin and Dr. Faustus,” a play in which demons abound. The\r\nsupernumerary spirit ascending by the roof instead of leaving by the door\r\nwith his paid companions, was believed to have so frightened manager Rich\r\nthat, taking the warning against theatrical profanity to heart, he never\r\nhad the courage to open the theatre again.[759] The legend is curious, as\r\nit proves that even in 1732 the old Puritan horror of theatricals had not\r\nquite died out, and that at that period the poorer part of the audience\r\nwas still ignorant enough to attribute mechanical tricks to supernatural\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nGarrick, in one of his prologues, speaks of Rich, under the name of Lun--\r\n\r\n  “When Lun appeared with matchless art and whim,\r\n  He gave the power of speech to every limb;\r\n  Though masked and mute, convey’d his quick intent,\r\n  And told in frolic gestures all he meant;\r\n  But now the motley coat and sword of wood\r\n  Require a tongue to make them understood.”\r\n\r\nEvery motion of Rich meant something. His “statue scene” and “catching the\r\nbutterfly” were moving pictures. His “harlequin hatched from an egg by\r\nsun-heat” is highly spoken of; Jackson calls it “a masterpiece of dumb\r\nshow.” From the first chipping of the egg, his receiving of motion, his\r\nfeeling the ground, his standing upright, to his quick harlequin trip\r\nround the broken egg, every limb had its tongue. Walpole says, “His\r\npantomimes were full of wit, and coherent, and carried on a story.” Yet\r\nRich was so ignorant that he called a ‘turban’ a ‘turbot,’ and an\r\n‘adjective’ an ‘adjutant.’\r\n\r\nSpiller, who died of apoplexy in Portugal Street, in 1729-30 as he was\r\nplaying in the “Rape of Proserpine,” was inimitable in old men. This was\r\nthe year that Quin played Macheath for his benefit, and Fielding brought\r\nout his inimitable “Tom Thumb” at the Haymarket, to ridicule the bombast\r\nof Thomson and Young.\r\n\r\nKing’s College Hospital, which occupies a large portion of the southern\r\nside of Carey Street, is connected with the medical school of King’s\r\nCollege, and is supported by voluntary contributions. For each guinea a\r\nyear a subscriber may recommend one in and two out patients. Contributors\r\nacquire the same right for every donation of ten guineas. Annual\r\nsubscribers of three guineas, or donors of thirty guineas, are governors\r\nof the hospital. The house is surrounded by a population of nearly 400,000\r\npersons, of whom about 20,000 annually receive relief. In one year 363\r\npoor married women have been attended in confinements at their own houses.\r\n\r\nThe last memorial of a gay generation, passed like last year’s swallows,\r\nwas a headstone that used to stand in the burial-ground belonging to St.\r\nClement’s, now the site of King’s College Hospital. The slab rose from\r\nrank green grass that was sprinkled with dead cats, worn-out shoes, and\r\nfragments of tramps’ bonnets; in summer it was half hid by a clump of\r\nsunflowers.[760] It kept dimly alive the memory of Joe Miller, a taciturn\r\nactor, in whose mouth Mottley, the poet put his volume of jokes that had\r\nbeen raked from every corner of the town. Mottley was a place-seeker and a\r\nwriter of stilted tragedies and a bad comedy, for whose benefit night\r\nQueen Caroline, wife of George II., condescended to sell tickets at her\r\nown drawing-room.[761] Miller appears to have been an honest, and stupid\r\nfellow, but some good sayings are embalmed in the rather coarse book which\r\nbears his name. His portrait represents Joe as a broad-nosed man with\r\nlarge saucer eyes, a big absurd mouth, and a look of comic stolid\r\nsurprise. He died in 1738, and the Jest Book was published the year after,\r\nprice one shilling.\r\n\r\nJoe Miller made his first appearance on the stage in 1715, at Drury Lane,\r\nin Farquhar’s comedy of “A trip to the Jubilee.” He also played Clodpole\r\nin Betterton’s “Amorous Widow,” Sir H. Gubbin in Steele’s “Tender\r\nHusband,” La Foole in Ben Jonson’s “Epicene,” and above all Sir Joseph\r\nWhittol in Congreve’s “Old Bachelor.” Hogarth designed a benefit ticket\r\nfor this play. As Ben in “Love for Love,” Cibber cut out Joe Miller. In\r\n1721 Joe opened a booth at Bartholomew Fair with Pinkethman. His last\r\ngreat success was as the Miller in Dodsley’s farce of “The King and the\r\nMiller of Mansfield.” Stephen Duck, the Wiltshire thresher, afterwards a\r\npopular preacher, wrote his epitaph. Joe Miller’s monument is still\r\ncarefully preserved in one of the rooms in King’s College Hospital. John\r\nMottley, his editor, was the son of a Colonel Mottley, a Jacobite who\r\nfollowed James into France. His son was placed in the Excise Office, and\r\ngrew up a place-hunter. He wrote a bad tragedy called “The Imperial\r\nCaptives,” and was promised a commissionership of wine licenses by Lord\r\nHalifax, and a place in the Exchequer by Sir Robert Walpole, but received\r\nnothing from either. He compiled the Jest-Book, it is said partly from the\r\nrecollection of the comedian’s conversations,[762] but it is doubtful if\r\nthis is true. The compilation (once so useful to diners-out) went through\r\nthree editions in 1739, and at about the thirteenth edition was reprinted,\r\nafter thirty years, by Barker, of Russell Street, Covent Garden.[763]\r\n\r\nThe Grange public-house close by, with its picturesque old courtyard, is\r\nmentioned by Davenant, in his “Playhouse to Let,” as an inn patronised by\r\npoets and actors.\r\n\r\nThe Black Jack public-house in Portsmouth Street was Joe Miller’s\r\nfavourite haunt. Some paintings on its walls still testify to the\r\noccasional presence of artists of the last century. This inn used to be\r\ncalled “The Jump,” from that adroit young scoundrel Jack Sheppard having\r\nonce jumped from one of its first-floor windows to escape the armed\r\nemissaries of that still greater thief, the thief-taker, Mr. Jonathan\r\nWild.\r\n\r\nWhen paviours dig deep under the Strand they find the fossil remains of\r\nantediluvian monsters. A church in the street bears a name that carries us\r\nback to the times of the Saxons and the Danes. In one lane there is a\r\nRoman bath, in another there are the nodding gable-ends of houses at which\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher may have looked, and which Shakspere and Ben Jonson\r\nmust have visited. So the Present is built out of the Past. The Strand\r\nteems with associations of every period of history. The story of St.\r\nGiles’s parish alone should embrace the whole records of London vagrancy.\r\nThe chronicle of Lincoln’s Inn Fields embraces reminiscences of half our\r\ngreat lawyers. In the chapter on St. Martin’s Lane I have been glad to\r\nnote down some interesting incidents in the careers of many of our\r\ngreatest painters. Long Acre leads us to Dryden, Cromwell, Wilson, and\r\nStothard. At Charing Cross we have stopped to see how brave men can die\r\nfor a good cause.\r\n\r\nA thorough history of our great city, considered in every aspect, would\r\nalmost be a condensed history of the world. I offer these pages to my\r\nreaders only as a humble contribution to the history of London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLACK JACK, PORTSMOUTH STREET, LINCOLN’S INN FIELDS.]\r\n\r\nOur commercial wealth and the vastness of our maritime enterprise is shown\r\nin nothing more than by the distance from which we fetch our commonest\r\narticles of consumption--tea from China, sugar from the West Indies,\r\ncoffee from Ceylon, oil from the farthest nooks of Italy, chocolate from\r\nMexico. An Englishman need not be very rich in order to consume samples\r\nof all these productions of different hemispheres at a single meal.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner many books of far-divided ages have gone to form the\r\npatchwork of the present volume; I am like the merchant who sends his\r\nships to collect in different harbours, and across wide and adverse seas,\r\nthe materials that he needs. In this busy and overworked age there are\r\nmany persons who have no time themselves to make such voyages, no patience\r\nto traverse such seas, even if they possessed the charts: it is for them I\r\nhave written, and it is from them I hope for some kind approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n    “The West End seems to me one vast cemetery. Hardly a street but has\r\n    in it a house once occupied by dear friends with whom I had daily\r\n    intercourse: if I stopped and knocked now, who would know or take\r\n    interest in me? _The streets to me are peopled with shadows: the city\r\n    is as a city of the dead._”--SAMUEL ROGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAND (SOUTH SIDE).--p. 25.\r\n\r\n    “I often shed tears in the motley Strand for fulness of joy at such\r\n    multitude of life.”--CHARLES LAMB’S _Letters_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nThe Strand is three-quarters of a mile long. Van de Wyngerede’s view,\r\n1543, shows straggling houses on the south side, but on the north side all\r\nis open to Covent Garden. There were three water-courses, crossed by\r\nbridges. Haycock’s Ordinary, near Palsgrave Place, was much frequented in\r\nthe seventeenth century by Parliament men and town gallants. No. 217 was\r\nthe shop of Snow, a wealthy goldsmith who withstood the South Sea Bubble\r\nwithout injury. Gay describes him during the panic with black pen behind\r\nhis ear. He says to Snow--\r\n\r\n  “Thou stoodst (an Indian king in size and hue);\r\n  Thy unexhausted shop was our Peru.”\r\n\r\nThe Robin Hood Debating Society held its meetings in Essex Street. Burke\r\nspoke here, and Goldsmith was a member. The great Cottonian Library was\r\nkept in Essex House from 1712 to 1730, on the site of the Unitarian\r\nChapel, built about 1774. Mr. Lindsey, Dr. Disney, Mr. Belsham\r\n(Priestley’s successor) preached here, and after Mr. Belsham the Rev.\r\nThomas Madge. At George’s Coffee-house, now 213 Strand, Foote describes\r\nthe town wits meeting in 1751. Shenstone was a frequenter of this house,\r\nand came here to read pamphlets--the subscription being one shilling. The\r\nGrecian Coffee-house was used by Goldsmith and the Irish and Lancashire\r\nTemplars. Milford Lane was so named from an adjacent ford over the Thames.\r\nA windmill stood near St. Mary’s Church, temp. James I. Sir Richard Baker,\r\nthe worthy old chronicler whom Sir Roger de Coverley so admired, lived in\r\nthis lane in 1632-9. The old houses were taken down in 1852. No. 191 was\r\nthe shop of William Godwin, bookseller, the author of _Caleb Williams_,\r\nand the friend of Lamb and Shelley.--Strype mentions the Crown and Anchor\r\nTavern. Here, in 1710, was instituted the Academy of Ancient Music. Here,\r\non Fox’s birthday, in 1798, 2000 guests were feasted. Johnson and Boswell\r\noccasionally supped here, and here the Royal Societies were held. In\r\nSurrey Street, in a large garden-house at the east end fronting the river,\r\nlived the Hon. Charles Howard, the eminent chemist who discovered the\r\nprocess of sugar-refining _in vacuo_.\r\n\r\nAt No. 169, now the Strand Theatre, Barker, an artist, exhibited the\r\npanorama--his own invention--suggested to him when sketching under an\r\numbrella on the Calton Hill. No. 217, now a branch of the London and\r\nWestminster Bank, was formerly Paul, Strahan, and Bates’s,[764] who in\r\n1858 disposed of their customers’ securities to the amount of £113,625,\r\nand were sentenced to fourteen years’ penal servitude. The drinking\r\nfountain opposite St. Mary’s Church is a product of a most useful\r\nassociation. The first fountain erected under its auspices was opened in\r\nApril 1859, by Lord John Russell, Lord Carlisle, and Mr. Gurney.--At No.\r\n147 was published the _Sphinx_, and Jan. 2, 1828, No. 1 of the _Athenæum_.\r\nNo. 149 is the shop once belonging to Mr. Mawe, the mineralogist, who was\r\nsucceeded by James Tennant, Professor of Mineralogy at King’s College. At\r\nNo. 132 Strand (site of Wellington Street), the first circulating library\r\nin London was started by a Mr. Wright, in 1740. Opposite Southampton\r\nStreet, from 1686 to late in the last century, lived Vaillant, the eminent\r\nforeign bookseller. No. 143 was the site of the first office of the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_ (Perry succeeding Woodfall in 1789). Lord Campbell and\r\nHazlitt were theatrical critics to this paper. Mr. Dickens was a\r\nparliamentary reporter, Mr. Serjeant Spankie an editor, Campbell the poet\r\na contributor. On Perry’s death, in 1821, it was purchased by Mr. Clement\r\nfor £42,000. The _Mirror_, the first cheap illustrated periodical was also\r\npublished at this office. At No. 1 lived Rudolph Ackermann, the German\r\nprintseller, who introduced lithography and annuals. He illuminated his\r\ngallery when gas was a novelty. Aaron Hill was born in a dwelling on the\r\nsite of the present Beaufort House; Lord Clarendon lived here while his\r\nunlucky western house was building; and here, in 1660, the Duke of York\r\nmarried the chancellor’s daughter.\r\n\r\nThe York Buildings Water Company failed in 1731. Hungerford Hall and its\r\npanoramic pictures were burnt in 1854. At No. 18 Strand, in 1776, the\r\nelder Mathews the comedian was born; Dr. Adam Clarke and Rowland Hill used\r\nto visit his father, who was a religious bookseller. No. 7 Craven Street\r\n(Franklin’s old house) was long occupied by the Society for the Relief of\r\nPersons imprisoned for Small Debts. In Northumberland Court, once known as\r\n“Lieutenants’ Lodgings,” Nelson once lodged.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORFOLK STREET.--p. 44.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickens has sketched Norfolk Street in his own inimitable way.\r\n“Norfolk is a delightful street to lodge in, provided you don’t go lower\r\ndown (Mrs. Lirriper dates from No. 81); but of a summer evening, when the\r\ndust and waste paper lie in it, and stray children play in it, and a kind\r\nof gritty calm and bake settles on it, and a peal of church-bells is\r\npractising in the neighbourhood, it is a trifle dull; and never have I\r\nseen it since at such a time, and never shall I see it ever more at such a\r\ntime, without seeing the dull June evening when that forlorn young\r\ncreature sat at her open corner window on the second, and me at my open\r\ncorner window (the other corner) on the third.”[765]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAND THEATRE.--p. 53.\r\n\r\nThe Strand Theatre, No. 169, formerly called Punch’s Playhouse, was\r\naltered in 1831 for Rayner, the low comedian, and Mrs. Waylett, the\r\nsinger. Here were produced many of Douglas Jerrold’s early plays. Under\r\nMiss Swanborough’s management, Miss Marie Wilton, arch and witty as\r\nShakspere’s Maria, delighted the town. Here poor Rogers, now dead, was\r\ninimitable in burlesque female characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOMERSET COFFEE-HOUSE.--p. 56.\r\n\r\nThe bold and redoubtable Junius (now pretty well ascertained, after much\r\ninkshed, to be Sir Philip Francis) occasionally left his letters for\r\nWoodfall at the bar of the Somerset Coffee-house at the east corner of the\r\nentrance to King’s College. His other houses of call were the bar of the\r\nNew Exchange, and now and then Munday’s in Maiden Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMERSET HOUSE.--p. 56.\r\n\r\nThe School of Design, formerly located in Somerset House, was established\r\nin 1857, under the superintendence of the Board of Trade, for the\r\nimprovement of ornamental art, with regard more especially to our staple\r\nEnglish manufactures. The school is now incorporated with the Science and\r\nArt Schools at South Kensington, which have been established, under\r\nGovernment, in connection with South Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING’S COLLEGE.--p. 56.\r\n\r\nKing’s College and School (to the latter of which the author owes some\r\ngratitude for a portion of his education) form a proprietary institution\r\nthat occupies an east wing of Somerset House which was built to receive\r\nit. The college was founded in 1828; its fundamental principle is, that\r\ninstruction in religion is an indispensable part of instruction, without\r\nwhich knowledge “will be conducive neither to the happiness of the\r\nindividual nor the welfare of the State.” The college education is divided\r\ninto five departments:--1. Theology. 2. General Literature and Science. 3.\r\nApplied Sciences. 4. Medicine. 5. The School. A certificate of good\r\nconduct, signed by his last instructor, is required of each pupil on\r\nentry. The age for admission is from nine to sixteen years. A limited\r\nnumber of matriculated students can live within the walls. Each proprietor\r\ncan nominate two pupils--one to the school, and one to the college. The\r\nmuseum once contained the celebrated calculating machine of the late Mr.\r\nCharles Babbage. This scientific toy was given by the Commissioners of the\r\nWoods and Forests. It is now at South Kensington. The collection of\r\nmechanical models and philosophical instruments was formed by George III.\r\nand presented to the college by Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELMET COURT.--p. 56.\r\n\r\nHelmet Court-so called from the Helmet Inn-is over against Somerset House.\r\nThe inn is enumerated in a list of houses and taverns made in the reign of\r\nJames I.[766] When the King of Denmark came to see his daughter, he was\r\nlodged in Somerset House, and new kitchen-ranges were set up at the Helmet\r\nand the Swan at the expense of the Crown. Henry Condell, a fellow-actor\r\nwith Shakspere, left his houses in Helmet Court to “Elizabeth, his\r\nwell-beloved wife.”[767]\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUFORT BUILDINGS.--p. 83.\r\n\r\nCharles Dibdin, born 1745, the author of 1300 songs, gave his musical\r\nentertainments at the Lyceum, and at Scott and Idle’s premises in the\r\nStrand. Latterly, assisted by his pupils, he conducted public musical\r\nsoirees at Beaufort Buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUTTS’S BANK.--p. 86.\r\n\r\nMr. Coutts died in 1822. He was a pallid, sickly, thin old gentleman, who\r\nwore a shabby coat and a brown scratch-wig.[768] He was once stopped in\r\nthe street by a good-natured man, who insisted on giving him a guinea. The\r\nbanker, however, declined the present with thanks, saying he was in no\r\n“immediate want.” Miss Harriet Mellon first appeared at Drury Lane in\r\n1795, as Lydia Languish. Mr. Coutts married Miss Mellon in 1815. She made\r\nher last appearance at Drury Lane, early in the same year, as Audrey. She\r\nleft the bulk of her fortune to Miss Angela Burdett-Coutts, whose gold the\r\n_Morning Herald_ once computed at 13 tons, or 107 flour-sacks full. The\r\nsum, £1,800,000, was the exact sum also left by old Jemmy Wood of\r\nGloucester. Counting a sovereign a minute, it would take ten weeks to\r\ncount; and placed sovereign to sovereign, it would reach 24 miles 260\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nCoutts’s Bank was founded by George Middleton. Till Coutts’s time it stood\r\nnear St. Martin’s Church. Good-natured Gay banked there, and afterwards\r\nDr. Johnson, Sir Walter Scott, and the Duke of Wellington. The Royal\r\nFamily have banked at Coutts’s ever since the reign of Queen Anne.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DARK ARCHES.--p. 97.\r\n\r\n“The Adelphi arches, many of which are used for cellars and coal-wharfs,\r\nremind one in their grim vastness,” says Mr. Timbs, “of the Etruscan\r\nCloaca of old Rome.” Beneath the “dry arches” the most abandoned\r\ncharacters used to lurk; outcasts and vagrants came there to sleep, and\r\nmany a street thief escaped from his pursuers in those subterranean haunts\r\nbefore the introduction of gas-light and a vigilant police. Mr. Egg, that\r\ntragic painter, placed the scene of one of his most pathetic pictures by\r\nthis part of what was once the river-bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY OF ARTS.--p. 99.\r\n\r\nLord Folkestone and Mr. Shipley founded the Society of Arts, at a meeting\r\nat Rawthmell’s Coffee-house, in Catharine Street, in March 1754. It was\r\nproposed to give rewards for the discovery of cobalt and the cultivation\r\nof madder in England. Premiums were also to be given for the best drawings\r\nto a certain number of boys and girls under the age of sixteen. The first\r\nprize, £15, was adjudged by the society to Cosway, then a boy of fifteen.\r\nThe society was initiated in Crane Court; from thence it removed to\r\nCraig’s Court, Charing Cross; from there to the Strand, opposite Beaufort\r\nBuildings; and from thence, in 1774, to the Adelphi.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of Barry’s six pictures in the Council Room are the following\r\n(beginning on the left as you enter):--1. “Orpheus.” The figure of Orpheus\r\nand the heads of the two reclining women are thought fine. 2. “A Grecian\r\nHarvest Home” (the best of the series). 3. “Crowning the Victors at\r\nOlympia.” 4. “Commerce, or the Triumph of the Thames.” (Dr. Burney, the\r\ncomposer, is composedly floating among tritons and sea-nymphs in his grand\r\ntie-wig and queue.) 5. “The Distribution of Premiums by the Society of\r\nArts.” (This picture contains a portrait of Dr. Johnson, for which he\r\nsat.) 6. “Elysium, or the State of Final Retribution.”\r\n\r\nBarry did pretty well with this work, which occupied him from 1777 to\r\n1783. The society gave him £300 and a gold medal, and also £500, the\r\nprofit of two exhibitions-total, £800.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 the society had proposed to the Academy to decorate the Council\r\nRoom, and be reimbursed by the exhibition of the works. Reynolds and the\r\nrest refused, but Barry soon afterwards obtained permission to execute the\r\nwhole, stipulating to be paid for his colours and models. Barry at the\r\ntime had only sixteen shillings in his pocket. During the progress of the\r\nwork the painter, being in want, applied for a small subscription through\r\nSir George Savile, but in vain. An insolent secretary even objected to his\r\ncharge for colours and models. The society afterwards relented and\r\nadvanced £100. Barry died poor, neglected, and half crazy, in 1806, aged\r\nsixty-five.\r\n\r\nThe Adelphi Rooms contain three poor statues (Mars, Venus, and Narcissus)\r\nby Bacon, R.A., a portrait of Lord Romney by Reynolds, and a full-length\r\nportrait of Jacob, Lord Folkestone, the first president, by Gainsborough.\r\nIn the ante-room, in a bad light, hangs a characteristic likeness of poor,\r\nwrongheaded Barry. The pictures are to be seen between ten and four any\r\nday but Wednesday and Saturday. The society meets every Wednesday at eight\r\nfrom October 31 to July 31.\r\n\r\nIn the Council Room, that parade-ground of learned men, Goldsmith once\r\nmade an attempt at a speech, but was obliged to sit down in confusion. Dr.\r\nJohnson once spoke there on “Mechanics,” “with a propriety, perspicuity,\r\nand energy which excited general admiration.”[769]\r\n\r\nJonas Hanway, that worthy old Russian merchant, when he came to see\r\nBarry’s pictures, insisted on leaving a guinea instead of the customary\r\nshilling. The Prince of Wales gave Barry sittings. Timothy Hollis left him\r\n£100. Lord Aldborough declared that the painter had surpassed Raphael.\r\nLord Romney gave him 100 guineas for a copy of one of the heads, and Dr.\r\nJohnson praised the “grasping mind” in the six pictures.[770]\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCHY OF LANCASTER.--p. 110.\r\n\r\nThe Duchy of Lancaster is a liberty (whatever that means) in the Strand.\r\nIt belongs to the Crown, the Queen being “Duchess of Lancaster.” It begins\r\nwithout Temple Bar and runs as far as Cecil Street. The annual revenue of\r\nthe duchy is about £75,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERLOO BRIDGE.--p. 124.\r\n\r\nHood’s exquisite poem, “The Bridge of Sighs,” appeared in “Hood’s\r\nMagazine” in May 1844. The poet’s son informs me that he believes that the\r\npoem was not suggested by any special incident, but that a great many\r\nsuicides had been reported in the papers about that time.\r\n\r\n  “The bleak wind of _March_\r\n  Made her tremble and shiver”\r\n\r\nmarks the date of the writing,\r\n\r\n  “But not the dark arch\r\n  Of the black flowing river.”\r\n\r\nThe dark arch is that of Waterloo Bridge, a spot frequently selected by\r\nunfortunate women who meditate suicide, on account of its solitude and\r\nprivacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYORK HOUSE.--p. 135.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Buckingham, York House was entrusted to the\r\nguardianship of that Flemish adventurer and quack in art, Sir Balthasar\r\nGerbier, who here quarrelled and would have fought with Gentilleschi, a\r\nPisan artist who had been invited over by Charles I., and of whom he was\r\nintolerably jealous. Some of Gentilleschi’s work is still preserved at\r\nMarlborough House. The York Buildings Waterworks Company was started in\r\nthe 27th year of Charles II. In 1688 there were forty-eight shares. After\r\nthe Scotch rebellion in 1715, the company invested large sums in\r\npurchasing forfeited estates, which no Scotchman would buy. The concern\r\nbecame bankrupt. The residue of the Scotch estates was sold in 1783 for\r\n£102,537.[771]\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM STREET.--p. 135.\r\n\r\nIt is always pleasant to recall any scenes on which the light of Mr.\r\nDickens’s fancy has even momentarily rested. It was to Buckingham Street\r\nthat Mr. David Copperfield went with his aunt to take chambers commanding\r\na view of the river. They were at the top of the house, very near the\r\nfire-escape, with a half-blind entry and a stone-blind pantry.[772]\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNGERFORD BRIDGE.--p. 138.\r\n\r\nThe Hungerford Suspension Bridge was purchased in 1860 by a company of\r\ngentlemen, and used in the construction of the bridge across the Avon at\r\nClifton. This aerial roadway has a span of 703 feet, and is built at the\r\nheight of 245 feet. It cost little short of £100,000. A bridge at Clifton\r\nwas first suggested in 1753 by Alderman Vick of Bristol, who left a\r\nnest-egg of £1000. The bridge was completed and opened in 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GAIETY THEATRE, STRAND (NORTH SIDE).--p. 147.\r\n\r\nThis elegant and well-appointed theatre, near the corner of Wellington\r\nStreet, was built in 1868, from the designs of Mr. C. J. Phillips. It\r\noccupies the site of the Strand Music Hall, a large building which had\r\nbeen erected in the place of an arcade which the late Lord Exeter had\r\nbuilt here in order to resuscitate the glories of old Exeter ’Change. Both\r\nthe arcade and music hall proved disastrous failures, whilst the Gaiety\r\nTheatre, on the other hand, has turned out immensely successful, under the\r\nmanagement of Mr. John Hollingshead.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAND (NORTH SIDE).--p. 147.\r\n\r\nSir John Denham, the poet, when a student at Lincoln’s Inn, in 1638, in a\r\ndrunken frolic blotted out with ink all the Strand signs from Temple Bar\r\nto Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nIn a house in Butcher Row, Winter, Catesby, Wright, and Guy Fawkes met and\r\ntook the sacrament together. Raleigh’s widow lived in Boswell Court, and\r\nalso Lord Chief Justice Lyttelton and Sir Richard and Lady Fanshawe; and\r\nin Clement’s Lane resided Sir John Trevor, cousin to Judge Jeffries and\r\nSpeaker to the House of Commons. Dr. Johnson’s pew at St. Clement’s is No.\r\n18 in the north gallery; Dr. Croly put up a tablet to his memory. The\r\n_Tatler_, 1710, announces a stage-coach from the One Bell in the Strand\r\n(No. 313) to Dorchester.\r\n\r\nNo. 317 was the forge kept by the Duchess of Albemarle’s father, and it\r\nfaced the Maypole; Aubrey describes it as the corner shop, the first\r\nturning to the right as you come out of the Strand into Drury Lane. Dr.\r\nKing died at No. 332, once the _Morning Chronicle_ office. The New Exeter\r\nChange--the site of which is now covered by the Gaiety Theatre and\r\nRestaurant--was designed by Sydney Smirke, with Jacobean frontage. East of\r\nExeter Change stood the Canary House, mentioned by Dryden as famous for\r\nits sack with the “abricot” flavour. Pepys mentions Cary House, probably\r\nthe same place. At No. 352 was born, in 1798, Henry Neale the poet, son of\r\nthe map and heraldic engraver. In Exeter Change No. 1 of the _Literary\r\nGazette_ was published, January 25, 1817. Old Parr lodged at No. 405, the\r\nQueen’s Head public-house. No. 429, built for an insurance office by Mr.\r\nCockerell, has a fine façade. At No. 448 is the Electric Telegraph Office;\r\nthe time signal-ball, liberated by a galvanic current sent from Greenwich,\r\nfalls exactly at one, and drops ten feet. The old Golden Cross Hotel stood\r\nfarther west than the present. The Lowther Arcade, designed by Witherden\r\nYoung, is 245 feet long and 20 feet broad. Here the electric eel and\r\nPerkin’s steam-gun were exhibited about 1838. In 1832 a Society for the\r\nExhibition of Models had been formed here. In 1831 the skeleton of a whale\r\nwas exhibited in a tent in Trafalgar Square; it was 98 feet long, and\r\nCuvier had estimated it to be nearly a thousand years old.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that for most of the facts in this note the author is\r\nindebted to that treasure-house of topographical anecdote, _Curiosities of\r\nLondon_, by J. Timbs, Esq., F.S.A., a book displaying an almost boundless\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROWN AND ANCHOR TAVERN.--p. 152.\r\n\r\nThe Crown and Anchor Tavern, at the corner of Arundel Street, was for some\r\nyears the Whittington Club. Before the alterations it had an entrance from\r\nthe Strand, which is now closed, its door being now in Arundel Street.\r\nDouglas Jerrold was one of the earliest promoters of this club, which was\r\nmuch used by young men of business. In 1873, after having been closed for\r\nsome time, it was re-opened as the Temple Club. The King of Clubs was\r\nstarted about 1801 by Mr. Robert (Bobus) Smith, brother of Sydney, a\r\nfriend of Canning’s, and Advocate-General of Calcutta. It sat every\r\nSaturday at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, at that time famous for its\r\ndinners and wine, and a great resort for clubs. Politics were excluded.\r\nOne of the chief members was Mr. Richard Sharpe, a partner in a West India\r\nhouse, and a Parliamentary speaker during Addington’s and Perceval’s\r\nadministrations. Mackintosh, Scarlett, Rogers the poetical banker, John\r\nAllen, and M. Dumont, an emigré and friend of the Abbé de Lisle, were also\r\nmembers. Erskine, too, often dropped in to spend an hour stolen from his\r\nimmense and overflowing business. He there told his story of Lord\r\nLoughborough trying to persuade him not to take Tom Paine’s brief. He once\r\nmet Curran there. A member of the club describes the ape’s face of the\r\nIrish orator, with the sunken and diminutive eyes that flashed lightning\r\nas he compared poor wronged Ireland to “Niobe palsied with sorrow and\r\ndespair over her freedom, and her prosperity struck dead before her.”[773]\r\n\r\n\r\nWYCH STREET.--p. 164.\r\n\r\n“In a horrible little court, branching northward from Wych Street,” writes\r\nMr. Sala, in an essay written in America, “good old George Cruikshank once\r\nshowed me the house where Jack Sheppard, the robber and prison-breaker,\r\nserved his apprenticeship to Mr. Wood, the carpenter; and on a beam in the\r\nloft of this house Jack is said to have carved his name. * * * Theodore\r\nHook used to say that “he never passed through Wych Street in a\r\nhackney-coach without being blocked up by a hearse and a coal waggon in\r\nthe van, and a mud-cart and the Lord Mayor’s carriage in the rear.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPER OFFICES.--p. 167.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to enumerate all the Strand newspaper offices,\r\npresent and past. It is, perhaps, sufficient to mention _The Spectator_ (a\r\nvery able paper,--office in Waterloo Place); _The London Journal_ (a\r\ncheap, well-conducted paper with an enormous circulation); _The Family\r\nHerald_ (the house formerly of Mr. Leigh, bookseller, a relation of the\r\nelder Mathews, and the first introducer of the _Guides_ that Mr. Murray\r\nhas now rendered so complete); _The Illustrated Times_, _The Morning\r\nPost_, _Notes and Queries_, _The Queen_, _Law Times_, _Athenæum_, and\r\n_Field_ (in Wellington Street); _Bell’s Life_, _The Globe_, _Bell’s\r\nMessenger_, _The Observer_, and lastly, _The Pall Mall Gazette_, and _The\r\nSaturday Review_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEEF-STEAK CLUB.--p. 172.\r\n\r\nBubb Doddington, Aaron Hill, “Leonidas” Glover, Sir Peere Williams (a\r\nyouth of promise, shot at the siege of Belleisle), Hoadly, and the elder\r\nColman (the author of _The Suspicious Husband_), were either guests or\r\nmembers of this illustrious club, whose origin dates back to Rich’s days\r\nin 1735. Then came the days of Lord Sandwich, Wilkes, Bonnell Thornton,\r\nArthur Murphy, Churchill, and Tickell. In 1785 the Prince of Wales\r\n(afterwards George IV.) became the twenty-fifth member.\r\n\r\nChurchill resigned when the club began to receive him coldly after his\r\ndesertion of his wife. Wilkes never visited the club after the\r\ncontemptuous rejection of his infamous poem, the _Essay on Woman_. Garrick\r\nwas a great ornament of the club; he once dined there dressed in the\r\ncharacter of Ranger. Little Serjeant Prime was another club celebrity of\r\nthat period. An anonymous writer describes a meeting of the club in or\r\nabout 1799. There were present John Kemble, Cobb of the India House, the\r\nDuke of Clarence, Sir John Cox Hippisley, Charles Morris (the writer of\r\nour best convivial songs), Ferguson of Aberdeen, Mingay, and the Duke of\r\nNorfolk. As the clock struck five, a curtain drew up, discovering the\r\nkitchen through a gridiron grating, over which was inscribed this motto--\r\n\r\n  “If it were done, when ’tis done, then ’twere well\r\n  It were done quickly.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk ate at least three steaks, and then when the cloth was\r\nremoved, took the chair on a dais, elevated some steps above the table,\r\nand above which hung the small cocked-hat in which Garrick played Ranger,\r\nand other insignia of the society. He was also invested with an orange\r\nribbon, to which a silver gridiron was appended. The sound motto “Beef and\r\nLiberty” is inscribed on the buttons of the members. It is the duty of the\r\njunior member at this club to bring up the wine. The writer before quoted\r\ndescribes seeing Lord Brougham and the Duke of Leinster performing this\r\nsubordinate duty. Sir John Hippisley was the man who Windham used to say\r\nwas very _nearly_ a clever fellow. Cobb was the author of “First Floor” (a\r\nfarce) and of three comic operas--“The Haunted Tower,” “The Siege of\r\nBelgrade,” and “Ramah Drûg.” To the two former Storace set his finest\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n“Captain” Morris, the author of those delightful songs, “The Town and\r\nCountry Life” and “When the Fancy-stirring Bowl wakes the Soul to\r\nPleasure,” used to brew punch and “out-watch the Bear” at this club till\r\nafter his seventy-eighth year. The Duke of Norfolk, at Kemble’s\r\nsolicitation, gave the veteran bard a pleasant little Sabine retreat near\r\nDorking. Jack Richards, the presbyter of the club, was famous for\r\ninflicting long verbal harangues on condemned social culprits.\r\n\r\nAnother much respected member was old William Linley, Sheridan’s\r\nbrother-in-law; nor must we forget Richard Wilson, Lord Eldon’s secretary,\r\nand Mr. Walsh, who had been in early life valet to Lord Chesterfield. The\r\nclub secretary, in 1828, was Mr. Henry Stephenson, comptroller to the Duke\r\nof Sussex; and about this time also flourished, either as guests or\r\nmembers, Lord Viscount Kirkwall, Rowland Stephenson the banker, and Mr.\r\nDenison, then M.P. for Surrey.[774]\r\n\r\nA literary friend tells me that the last time he saw Mr. Thackeray was one\r\nevening in Exeter Street. The eminent satirist of snobs was peering about\r\nfor the stage door of the Lyceum Theatre, or some other means of entrance\r\nto the Beef-steak Club, with whose members he had been invited to dine.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXETER CHANGE.--p. 175.\r\n\r\nThomas Clark, “the King of Exeter Change,” took a cutler’s stall here in\r\n1765 with £100 lent him by a stranger. By trade and thrift he grew so rich\r\nthat he once returned his income at £6000 a year, and before his death in\r\n1816 he rented the whole ground-floor of the Change. He left nearly half a\r\nmillion of money, and one of his daughters married Mr. Hamlet, the\r\ncelebrated jeweller. Some of the old materials of Exeter House, including\r\na pair of large Corinthian columns at the east end, were used in building\r\nthe Change, which was the speculation of a Dr. Barbon, in the reign of\r\nWilliam and Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAFALGAR SQUARE.--p. 221.\r\n\r\nThe fountains were constructed in 1845, after designs from Sir Charles\r\nBarry.\r\n\r\nMorley’s Hotel (1 to 3 at the south-east corner) is much frequented by\r\nAmerican travellers, who may be seen on summer evenings calmly smoking\r\ntheir cigars outside the chief entrance. The late proprietor, who died a\r\nfew years since, left nearly a hundred thousand pounds to the Foundling\r\nand other charities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION CLUB.--p. 226.\r\n\r\nThe Union Club House, which stands on the south-west of Trafalgar Square\r\nand faces Cockspur Street, was built by Sir Robert Smirke, R.A. The club,\r\nconsisting of 1000 members, has been in existence forty-four years; its\r\nexpenditure is about £10,000 a year. Its trustees are the Earl of\r\nLonsdale, Viscount Gage, Lord Trimleston, and Sir John Henry Lowther,\r\nBart. The entrance money is thirty guineas, the annual subscription six\r\nguineas. Mr. Peter Cunningham, writing in 1849, describes the club as “the\r\nresort chiefly of mercantile men of eminence;” but its present members are\r\nof all the professions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND’S BANK.--p. 227.\r\n\r\nThis bank is older than Coutts’s. Pope banked there. The Duke of\r\nSutherland and many of the Scottish nobility bank there.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MARTIN’S LANE.--p. 252.\r\n\r\nRoger Payne was a celebrated bookbinder in Duke’s Court, St. Martin’s\r\nLane, London. This ingenious artist, a native of Windsor Forest, was born\r\nin 1739, and first became initiated into the rudiments of his business\r\nunder the auspices of Mr. Pote, bookseller to Eton College. On settling in\r\nthe metropolis, about the year 1766, he worked for a short time for Thomas\r\nOsborne, bookseller in Holborn, but principally for _honest_ Thomas Payne,\r\nof the Mews Gate, who, although of the same name, was not related to him.\r\nHis talents as an artist, particularly in the finishing department, were\r\nof the first order, and such as, up to his time, had not been developed by\r\nany other of his countrymen. “Roger Payne,” says Dr. Dibdin, “rose like a\r\nstar, diffusing lustre on all sides, and rejoicing the hearts of all true\r\nsons of bibliomania.” He succeeded in executing binding with such artistic\r\ntaste as to command the admiration and patronage of many noblemen. His\r\n_chef-d’œuvre_ is a large paper copy of Æschylus, translated by the Rev.\r\nRobert Potter, the ornaments and decorations of which are most splendid\r\nand classical. The binding of this book cost Earl Spencer fifteen guineas.\r\n\r\nIt was by his artistic talents alone that Roger Payne became so celebrated\r\nin his day; for, owing to his excessive indulgence in strong ale, he was\r\nin person a deplorable specimen of humanity. As evidence of this\r\npropensity, his account-book contains the following memorandum of one\r\nday’s expenditure: “For bacon, one halfpenny; for liquor, one shilling.”\r\nEven his trade bills are literary curiosities in their way, and frequently\r\nillustrate his unfortunate propensity. On one delivered to Mr. Evans for\r\nbinding Barry’s work on _The Wines of the Ancients_, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n  “Homer the bard, who sung in highest strains,\r\n  Had, festive gift, a goblet for his pains:\r\n  Falernian gave Horace, Virgil fire,\r\n  And barley-wine my British muse inspire;\r\n  Barley-wine, first from Egypt’s learned shore,\r\n  Be this the gift to me from Calvert’s store!”\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of his life, as might have been expected, Roger\r\nPayne was the victim of poverty and disease. He closed his earthly career\r\nat his residence in Duke’s Court on Nov. 20, 1787, and was interred in the\r\nburial-ground of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, at the expense of his worthy\r\npatron, Mr. Thomas Payne. This excellent man had also a portrait taken and\r\nengraved of his namesake at his work in his miserable den, under which Mr.\r\nBindley wrote the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    “ROGERUS PAYNE: Natus Vindesor. MDCCXXXIX.; denatus Londin.\r\n    MDCCLXXXVII. Effigiem hanc graphicam solertis BIBLIOPEGI Μνημόσυνον\r\n    meritis BIBLIOPOLA dedit. Sumptibus Thomæ Payne. [Etch’d and published\r\n    by S. Harding, No. 127 Pall Mall, March 1, 1800.”][775]\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMINGS’ ROW.--p. 252.\r\n\r\nHemings’ Row, St. Martin’s Lane, was originally called Dirty Lane.[776]\r\nThe place probably derived its name from John Hemings, an apothecary\r\nliving there in 1679. Peter Cunningham writes in 1849: “Upon an old wooden\r\nhouse at the west end of this street, near the second-floor window, is the\r\nname given above, and the date 1680.”[777]\r\n\r\n\r\nBEDFORDBURY.--p. 261.\r\n\r\nMr. James Payne, a bookseller of Bedfordbury (perhaps the son of Thomas\r\nPayne), died in Paris in 1809. Mr. Burnet describes him as remarkable for\r\namenity as for probity and learning. Repeated journeys to Italy, France,\r\nand Germany had enabled him to collect a great number of precious MSS. and\r\nrare first editions, most of which went to enrich Lord Spencer’s\r\nlibrary--the most splendid collection ever made by a private person.[778]\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL OF BRISTOL.--p. 264.\r\n\r\nDigby, Earl of Bristol, whom Pepys accuses of losing King Charles his head\r\nby breaking off the treaty of Uxbridge, lived in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. His\r\nsecond daughter, Lady Ann, married the evil Earl of Sutherland. It was\r\nBristol who was base enough to impeach Lord Clarendon for selling Dunkirk\r\nand making Charles marry a barren queen. Burnet describes the earl as\r\nhaving become a Roman Catholic in order to be qualified for serving under\r\nDon John in Flanders. He was an astrologer,[779] and had the impudence to\r\ntell the king he was in danger from his brother. He renounced his new\r\nreligion openly at Wimbledon,[780] and then fled to France.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD HOUSE.--p. 277.\r\n\r\nWild House, Drury Lane, was formerly the town mansion of the Welds of\r\nLulworth Castle. Short’s Gardens were so called from Dudley Short, Esq.,\r\nwho had a mansion here with fine gardens in the reign of Charles II. In\r\nParker Street, Philip Parker, Esq., had a mansion in 1623.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAVEN HOUSE, DRURY LANE.--p. 292.\r\n\r\nPepys frequently mentions Lord Craven as attending the meetings at the\r\nTrinity House upon Admiralty business. The old veteran, whom he\r\nirreverently calls “a coxcomb,” complimented him on several occasions upon\r\nhis popularity with the Duke of York. Pennant says that Lord Craven and\r\nthe Duke of Albemarle “heroically stayed in town during the dreadful\r\npestilence, and, at the hazard of their lives, preserved order in the\r\nmidst of the terrors of the time.”[781] This fine old Don Quixote happened\r\nto be on duty at St. James’s when William’s Dutch troops were coming\r\nacross the park to take possession. Lord Craven would have opposed their\r\nentrance, but his timid master forbidding him to resist, he marched away\r\n“with sullen dignity.” The date of the sale of the pest-houses should be\r\n1722, not 1772.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRURY LANE.--p. 299.\r\n\r\nIn the Regency time, and before, Drury Lane was what the Haymarket is now.\r\nOyster shops, low taverns, and singing-rooms of the worst description\r\nsurrounded the theatre. One of the worst of these, even down to our own\r\ntimes, was “Jessop’s” (“The Finish”)--a great resort of low\r\nprize-fighters, gamblers, sporting men, swindlers, spendthrifts, and\r\ndrunkards. “_H.’s_” (I veil the infamous name), described in a MS. of\r\nHorace Walpole, is now a small, dingy theatrical tailor’s, and in the\r\nbesmirched back-shop shreds of gilding and smears of colour still show\r\nwhere Colonel Hanger knocked off the heads of champagne bottles, and\r\nafterwards, Lord Waterford and such “bloods” squandered their money and\r\ntheir health.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAVAGE CLUB.--p. 303.\r\n\r\nThe Savage Club, which was started at the Crown Tavern in Drury Lane, and\r\nthen removed to rooms next the Lyceum, and said to have been those once\r\noccupied by the Beef-steak Club, is now moored at Evans’s Hotel, Covent\r\nGarden. The name of the club has a duplex signification; it refers to\r\nRichard Savage the poet, and also to the Bohemian freedom of its members.\r\nIt includes in its number no small share of the literary talent of the\r\nLondon newspaper and dramatic world.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARE MARKET.--p. 339.\r\n\r\nDenzil Street was so called by the Earl of Clare in 1682, in memory of his\r\nuncle Denzil, Lord Holles, who died 1679-80. He was one of the five\r\nmembers of Parliament whom Charles I. so despotically and so unwisely\r\nattempted to seize. The inscription on the south-west wall of the street\r\nwas renewed in 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREET CHARACTERS.--p. 381.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to recapitulate the street celebrities from\r\nHogarth’s time to the present day which St. Giles’s has harboured. A\r\nwriter in _Notes and Queries_ mentions a man who used to sell dolls’\r\nbedsteads, and who was always said to have been the king’s evidence\r\nagainst the Cato Street conspirators. Charles Lamb describes, in his own\r\ninimitable way, an old sailor without legs who used to propel his\r\nmutilated body about the streets on a wooden framework supported on\r\nwheels. He was said to have been maimed during the Gordon riots. But I\r\nhave now myself to add to the list the most remarkable relic of all. There\r\nis (1868?) to be seen any day in the London streets a gaunt grey-haired\r\nold blind beggar, with hard strongly-marked features and bushy eyebrows.\r\nThis is no less a person than Hare the murderer, who years ago aided Burke\r\nin murdering poor mendicants and houseless people in Edinburgh, and\r\nselling their bodies to the surgeons for dissection. Hare, a young man\r\nthen, turned king’s evidence and received a pardon. He came to London with\r\nhis blood money, and entered himself as a labourer under an assumed name\r\nat a tannery in the suburbs. The men discovering him, threw the wretch\r\ninto a steeping-pit, from which he escaped, but with loss of both eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN DIALS.--p. 385.\r\n\r\nEvelyn describes going (Oct. 5, 1694) to see the seven new streets in St.\r\nGiles’s, then building by Mr. Neale, who had introduced lotteries in\r\nimitation of those of Venice. The Doric column was removed in July 1773,\r\nin the hope of finding a sum of money supposed to be concealed under the\r\nbase. The search was ineffectual; the pillar now ornaments the common at\r\nWeybridge. Gay describes Seven Dials, in his own pleasant, inimitable way\r\n(circa 1712).\r\n\r\n  “Where fam’d St. Giles’s ancient limits spread,\r\n  An inrailed column rears its lofty head,\r\n  Here to seven streets seven dials count the day,\r\n  And from each other catch the circling ray;\r\n  Here oft the peasant, with inquiring face,\r\n  Bewildered trudges on from place to place;\r\n  He dwells on every sign with stupid gaze,\r\n  Enters the narrow alley’s doubtful maze,\r\n  Tries every winding court and street in vain,\r\n  And doubles o’er his weary steps again.”[782]\r\n\r\nMartinus Scriblerus is supposed to have been born in Seven Dials. Horace\r\nWalpole describes the progress of family portraits from the drawing-room\r\nto the parlour, from the parlour to the counting-house, from the\r\nhousekeeper’s room to the garret, and from thence to flutter in rags\r\nbefore a broker’s shop in the Seven Dials.[783] Here Taylor laid the scene\r\nof “Monsieur Tonson.”\r\n\r\n  “Be gar! there’s Monsieur Tonson come again!”\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Mr. Catnach, the printer of street ballads, lived in Seven\r\nDials. He died about 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREETS IN ST. GILES’S.--p. 385.\r\n\r\nIn Dyot Street lived Curll’s “Corinna,” Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas, and her\r\nmother.[784] At the Black Horse and Turk’s Head public-houses in this\r\nstreet, those wretches Haggerty and Holloway, in November 1802, planned\r\nthe murder of Mr. Steele on Hounslow Heath, and here they returned after\r\nthe perpetration of the crime. At the execution of these murderers at the\r\nOld Bailey, in 1807, twenty-eight persons were trampled to death. The\r\nstreet was immortalised by a song in _Bombastes Furioso_, an excellent and\r\nboisterous burlesque tragic opera, written by William Barnes Rhodes, a\r\nclerk in the Bank of England. Bainbridge and Breckridge Streets, St.\r\nGiles’s, now no more, were built prior to 1672, and derived their names\r\nfrom the owners, eminent parishioners in the reign of Charles II. Dyot\r\nStreet was inhabited as late as 1803 by Philip Dyot, Esq., a descendant of\r\nRichard Dyot, from whom it derived its name. In 1710 there was a\r\n“Mendicants’ Convivial Club” held at the Welsh’s Head in this street. The\r\nclub was founded in 1660, when its meetings were held at the Three Crowns\r\nin the Poultry. Denmark Street was probably built in 1689. Zoffany lived\r\nat No. 9. Bunbury, the caricaturist, laid the scene of his “Sunday Evening\r\nConversation” in this street. In July 1771 Sir John Murray, the\r\nPretender’s secretary, was carried off in a coach from his house near St.\r\nGiles’s Church by armed men.[785]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT GILES.--p. 385.\r\n\r\nThis saint has some scurvy worshippers. Pierce Egan, in his _Life in\r\nLondon_ (1820), afterwards dramatised, describes the thieves’ kitchens and\r\nbeggars’ revels, which men about town in those days thought it “the\r\ncorrect thing,” as the slang goes, to see and share. “The Rookery” was a\r\ntriangular mass of buildings, bounded by Bainbridge, George, and High\r\nStreets. It was swept away by New Oxford Street. The lodgings were\r\nthreepence a night. Sir Henry Ellis, in 1813, counted seventeen\r\nhorse-shoes nailed to thresholds in Monmouth Street as antidotes against\r\nwitches. Jews preponderate in this unsavoury street. Mr. Henry Mayhew\r\ndescribes a conversation with a St. Giles’s poet who wrote Newgate\r\nballads, Courvousier’s Lamentation, and elegies. He was paid one shilling\r\neach for them. A parliamentary report of 1848 describes Seven Dials as in\r\na degraded state. “Vagrants, thieves, sharpers, scavengers, basket-women,\r\ncharwomen, army seamstresses, and prostitutes, compose its mass. Infidels,\r\nchartists, socialists, and blasphemers have their head-quarters there.\r\nThere are a hundred and fifty shops open on the Sunday. The ragged-school\r\nthere is badly situated and uninviting.” Mr. Albert Smith says gin shops\r\nare the only guides in “the dirty labyrinth” of the Seven Dials. The\r\nauthor once accompanied a Scripture-reader to some of the lowest and\r\npoorest courts and alleys of St. Giles’s. In one bare room, he remembers,\r\non an earth floor, sat a blind beggar waiting for the return of his boy, a\r\nsweeper, who had been sent out to a street-crossing to try and earn some\r\nbread. In another room there was a poor old lonely woman who had made a\r\npet of an immense ram. We ended our tour by visiting an Irishwoman who had\r\nbeen converted from “Popery.” While we were there, some Irish boys\r\nsurrounded the house and shouted in at the key-hole, threatening to\r\ndenounce her to the priest. When we emerged from this den we were received\r\nwith a shower of peculiarly hard small potatoes, a penance which the\r\nauthor bore somewhat impatiently, while the Scripture-reader, who seemed\r\naccustomed to such rough compliments, took the blows like an early\r\nChristian martyr.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S INN HALL.--p. 398.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 or 1801 Mackintosh delivered lectures in the old Lincoln’s Inn\r\nHall on the “Laws of Nature and Nations.” They were attended by Canning,\r\nLord Liverpool, and a brilliant audience. They contained a panegyric on\r\nGrotius. In style Mackintosh was measured and monotonous--of the school of\r\nRobertson and Gilbert Stuart. He made one mistake in imputing the doctrine\r\nof the association of ideas to Hobbes, which Coleridge corrected. He\r\nrefuted the theories of Godwin in a masterly way.[786]\r\n\r\n\r\nSERLE STREET, LINCOLN’S INN FIELDS.--p. 401.\r\n\r\nThis street derived its name from a Mr. Henry Serle, who died intestate\r\ncirca 1690, much in debt, and with lands heavily mortgaged. He purchased\r\nthe property from the executors of Sir John Birkenhead, the conductor of\r\nthe Royalist paper, _Mercurius Aulicus_, during the Civil War, a writer\r\nwhose poetry Lawes set to music, and who died in 1679. New Square was\r\nformerly called Serle’s Court, and the arms of Serle are over the Carey\r\nStreet gateway. The second edition of _Barnaby’s Journal_ was printed in\r\n1716, for one Illidge, under Serle’s Gate, Lincoln’s Inn, New Square.[787]\r\nAddison seems to have visited Serle’s Coffee-house, to study from some\r\nquiet nook the “humours” of the young barristers. There is a letter extant\r\nfrom Akenside, the poet, addressed to Jeremiah Dyson, that excellent\r\nfriend and patron who defended him from the attacks of Warburton at\r\nSerle’s Coffee-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY.--p. 414.\r\n\r\nThe Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, now at 66 Lincoln’s Inn\r\nFields, had apartments in 1714 at No. 6 Serle’s Court. This society was\r\nfounded by Dr. Bray and four friends on the 8th of March 1699, and it\r\ncelebrated its third jubilee, or 150th anniversary, in 1849. The society\r\nassists schools and colonial churches, and is said to have distributed\r\nmore than a hundred millions of Bibles and Prayer-books since its\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOANE MUSEUM.--p. 424.\r\n\r\nThe following squib is said to have been placed under the plates at an\r\nAcademic dinner:--\r\n\r\n  “THE MODERN GOTH.\r\n\r\n  “Glory to thee, great artist soul of taste\r\n  For mending pigsties where a plank’s displaced,\r\n  Whose towering genius plans from deep research\r\n  Houses and temples fit for Master Birch\r\n  To grace his shop on that important day\r\n  When huge twelfth-cakes are raised in bright array.\r\n  Each pastry pillar shows thy vast design;\r\n  Hail! then, to thee, and all great works of thine.\r\n  Come, let me place thee in the foremost rank\r\n  With him whose dulness discomposed the Bank.”\r\n\r\nThe writer then, apostrophising Wren, adds--\r\n\r\n  “Oh, had he lived to see thy blessed work,\r\n  To see pilasters scored like loins of pork,\r\n  To see the orders in confusion move,\r\n  Scrolls fixed below and pedestals above,\r\n  To see defiance hurled at Rome and Greece,\r\n  Old Wren had never left the world in peace.\r\n  Look where I will--above, below is shown\r\n  A pure disordered order of thy own;\r\n  Where lines and circles curiously unite\r\n  A base compounded, compound composite,\r\n  A thing from which in turn it may be said,\r\n  Each lab’ring mason turns abash’d his head;\r\n  Which Holland reprobates and Dance derides,\r\n  While tasteful Wyatt holds his aching sides.”[788]\r\n\r\nSoane foolishly brought an action against the bitter writer; but Lord\r\nKenyon directed the jury to find for the defendant on the ground that the\r\nsatire was not personal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n

It was one of the oldest banking-houses in London, second only to\r\nChild’s. At the period of the Commonwealth Snow and Co. carried on the\r\nbusiness of pawnbrokers, under the sign of the “Golden Anchor.” The firm\r\nsuspended payment about 1679 (as did many other banks), owing to the\r\ntyranny of Charles II. Strahan (the partner at the time of the last\r\nfailure) had changed his name from Snow; his uncle, named Strahan (Queen’s\r\nprinter?) having left him £180,000, making change of name a condition. It\r\nis curious that on examining Strahan and Co.’s books, it was found by\r\nthose of 1672 that a decimal system had been then employed. Strahan was\r\nknown to all religious people. Bates had for many years been managing\r\nclerk. The firm had also a navy agency in Norfolk Street. They had\r\nencumbered themselves with the Mostyn Collieries to the amount of\r\n£139,940, and backed up Gandells, contractors who were making railways in\r\nFrance and Italy and draining Lake Capestang, lending £300,000 or\r\n£400,000. They finally pledged securities (£22,000) to the Rev. Dr.\r\nGriffiths, Prebendary of Rochester. Sir John Dean Paul got into a\r\nsecond-class carriage at Reigate, the functionaries trying to get in after\r\nhim; the porter pulled them back, the train being in motion! Paul went to\r\nLondon alone, and in spite of telegraph got off, but at eight o’clock next\r\nnight surrendered. The three men were tried October 26 and 27, 1858.\r\n\r\n[765] _Mrs. Lirriper’s Lodgings_ (1863), pp. 6, 7.\r\n\r\n[766] _Harleian MS._, 6850.\r\n\r\n[767] _Cunningham_, vol. i. p. 378.
