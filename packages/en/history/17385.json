They appeared as cover stories for the __TV Shopper__, a free\r\nweekly paper that was distributed to homes and businesses in New York\r\nCity. Founded by Bruce Logan in the mid-1970s as the __West Side TV\r\nShopper__, it consisted of TV listings, advertisements, and two full-page\r\nstories per issue. One was a \"friendly\" restaurant review of an advertiser;\r\nthe other was a profile of a prominent resident of the Upper West Side of\r\nManhattan. The honoree's face appeared on the cover, framed by a TV\r\nscreen.\r\n\r\nThe formula was successful enough so that in 1978, Bruce began\r\npublishing the __East Side TV Shopper__ as well. My job was to track\r\ndown the biggest names I could find for both papers, interview them, and\r\nwrite a 900-word story. Most interviewees were in the arts and\r\nentertainment industry -- actors, singers, dancers, writers, musicians,\r\nnews broadcasters and radio personalities. Bruce quickly recruited me to\r\nwrite the restaurant reviews as well. During my two and a half years at\r\nthe paper, I wrote about 210 interviews. These are my 100 favorites of the\r\nones that survive.\r\n\r\nThese stories represent my first professional work as a journalist. I arrived\r\nin New York City in November 1976 at age 26, hungry for an opportunity\r\nto write full-time after spending six years practicing my craft at college\r\nand community newspapers in New England. I had just started to sell a\r\nfew stories in Maine, but realized I would have to move to a big city if\r\nI was serious about switching careers from social worker to journalist.\r\n\r\nMy gigs as an unpaid writer for small local papers included a music\r\ncolumn for the __East Boston Community News__ and a theater column\r\nfor the _Wise Guide_ in Portland, Maine. I had learned the two most\r\nimportant rules of journalism -- get your facts straight and meet your\r\ndeadlines. I had taught myself Pitman's shorthand and could take notes at\r\n100 words a minute. So I felt ready to make the leap if someone gave me\r\na chance.\r\n\r\nFull of hope, I quit my job in rural Maine as a senior citizens' aide, drove\r\nto New York, sold my car, moved into an Upper West Side apartment\r\nwith two aspiring opera singers, and began to look for work.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of the New York personality, I soon observed, was that the\r\ngreat often mingled freely with the ordinary. At the Alpen Pantry Cafe in\r\nLincoln Center, where I worked briefly, David Hartman, host of _Good\r\nMorning America_, came in for his coffee every morning and waited in\r\nline like everyone else. John Lennon was said to walk his Westside\r\nneighborhood alone, and largely undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe other side of the New York mentality was shown by nightclubs\r\nsurrounded by velvet ropes, where uniformed doormen stood guard like\r\narmy sentries. Disdaining the riffraff, they picked out certain attractive\r\nindividuals milling outside and beckoned them to cut through the crowd,\r\npay their admission and enter. The appearance of status counted for much,\r\nand many people who lived on 58th Street, one block from Central Park,\r\ngot their mail through the back entrance so they could claim the higher\r\nclass address of Central Park West.\r\n\r\nIn early 1977 my shorthand skills got me a part-time job at the home of\r\nLinda Grover, a scriptwriter for the TV soap opera _The Doctors_. On\r\nthe day I met her, she dictated a half-hour script to me, winging it while\r\nglancing at an outline. My trial of fire was to transcribe it, type it up that\r\nnight and turn it in the next morning for revisions. I got little sleep, but\r\ncompleted the job. After that I became her secretary.\r\n\r\nLinda's soap work was unsteady, and to supplement her income she wrote\r\nall the cover stories for _TV Shopper_. After I'd been helping her for a\r\nfew months, she accepted a full-time job as headwriter for a new soap. I\r\nhad told her of my ambition and shown her some of my writing, so she\r\nrecommended me to Bruce as her replacement.\r\n\r\nFor my first assignment, Bruce sent me to interview Delores Hall, star of\r\na Broadway musical with an all-black cast, _Your Arms Too Short to Box\r\nWith God_. I went to the theater, watched the show, then met Delores\r\nbackstage. The first question I asked her was: \"Is that your real hair?\" She\r\nsmiled good-naturedly at my lack of diplomacy and didn't answer, but\r\nmade me feel completely at ease. She led me outside the theater, and\r\nwithout embarrassment, asked me to hail the taxi for us. Then she directed\r\nthe driver to a favorite soul food restaurant, where she stuffed herself\r\nwhile I conducted the interview. She was as gracious in my company as\r\nshe had been on the stage while bowing to a standing ovation. Later, her\r\nrole in the show won her the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a\r\nMusical.\r\n\r\nAfter completing my Delores Hall story, I was kept constantly busy at the\r\n_TV Shopper_ for as long as I stayed in New York. At first Bruce gave\r\nme all the leads, many of whom were people who had requested to be on\r\nthe cover. But soon I was after bigger game, and began to systematically\r\nhunt down people whom I had grown up admiring. I scanned _People_\r\nmagazine each week to find out which celebrities were New Yorkers.\r\nWhen I landed an important interview, I often visited the New York\r\nPublic Library of Performing Arts in Lincoln Center to study the clipping\r\nfiles and prepare my questions.\r\n\r\nA few interviewees were distant and arrogant, making it clear that they\r\nwouldn't be wasting their time with me if not for the insistence of their\r\nagent. A cover story in the _TV Shopper_ could possibly extend a\r\nBroadway run for a few days or sell another $10,000 worth of tickets to\r\nthe ballet or opera. But the vast majority of my interview subjects were\r\nfriendly, respectful, and even a little flattered by the thought of being on\r\nthe cover. In general, the biggest people were most likely to be\r\nunpretentious and generous of spirit.\r\n\r\nIt was thrilling experience to meet and interview the people who had been\r\nmy idols only a few years before. When we were alone together in a\r\nroom, I felt that -- if only for that brief period -- I were the equal of\r\nsomeone who had achieved greatness. I had grown up reading Superman\r\ncomics, and one day it flashed on me: this is Metropolis and I'm Clark\r\nKent!\r\n\r\nMy subjects probably found me somewhat of a rube. I didn't dress well,\r\nI had little knowledge of New York, I asked some very simplistic\r\nquestions, and until 1979 I didn't use a tape recorder. So perhaps some\r\nof the stars were put off their guard and revealed more of themselves than\r\nthey would have to a more professional interviewer. I was struck by how\r\nsingle-minded they were for success. Probing their brains was like getting\r\na second college education. Their main message was: Don't waste your\r\nlife and don't do anything just for money.\r\n\r\nOf course, many people declined my request for an interview. Among\r\nthose I fished for, but failed to reel in, were Richard Chamberlain, Isaac\r\nBashevis Singer, Bob Keeshan (Captain Kangaroo), Rex Reed, Halston,\r\nCarrie Fisher, Russell Baker, Ted Sorensen, Joseph Heller, Margaret\r\nMeade, Helen Gurley Brown and Ira Gershwin. Then there were the\r\nEastsiders and Westsiders too famous to even approach, such as Woody\r\nAllen, Bob Hope and Mikhail Baryshnikov.\r\n\r\nThe person who did more than anyone else to secure first-rank interviews\r\nfor me was Anna Sosenko, a woman in her late 60s who owned an\r\nautograph collectors' shop on West 62th Street filled with elegantly\r\nframed letters, manuscripts and autographed photos of some of the\r\ngreatest names in the history of entertainment. Despite her treasures, she\r\nalways talked with one hand over her mouth to hide the fact that she had\r\npractically no teeth.\r\n\r\nFor 23 years Anna had managed the career of cabaret superstar\r\nHildegarde Sell, and had penned Hildegarde's theme song, \"Darling, Je\r\nVous Aime Beaucoup.\" Anna was still a formidable figure in showbiz;\r\nevery year she produced a spectacular fund-raising all-star show in a\r\nBroadway theater that paid tribute to Broadway legends. Her 1979 show,\r\nwhich I attended, included live performances by Julie Andrews, Agnes\r\nDeMille, Placido Domingo, Alfred Drake, Tovah Feldshuh, Hermione\r\nGingold and Rex Harrison.\r\n\r\nI met Anna through her friendship with Bruce Logan, and she became my\r\ndirect link to many stars of the older generation, including Douglas\r\nFairbanks Jr., Lillian Gish, Ann Miller, Maureen O'Sullivan and Sammy\r\nCahn. One phone call from Anna was enough to get me an appointment.\r\n\r\nThe _TV Shopper_ interviews and restaurant reviews -- a total of four\r\nstories per week -- became my whole life, and I had little time for\r\nfriendships, hobbies or anything else. By late 1979, I realized that New\r\nYork City wasn't my natural element. It was too dog-eat-dog, too\r\noverwhelming, too impersonal. I had grown dissatisfied with working for\r\nthe _TV Shopper_, and felt that I had squeezed the juice from the orange;\r\nI had interviewed everyone I wanted to meet who was willing to sit down\r\nwith me. After interviewing my fifth or sixth broadcaster or dancer, things\r\nbegan to feel repetitive. I pondered what Tom Smothers had told me when\r\nI'd asked why the Smothers Brothers had split up as an act: \"First you just\r\ndo it, then you do it for fun, then you do it seriously, and then you're\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time I got an invitation from a friend in the San Francisco Bay\r\nArea to move out West and give it a try. I told Bruce I was quitting.\r\nWhen I gave the news to Anna, she said: \"You might never come back.\"\r\nShe was right.\r\n\r\nIn my last couple of months as a New Yorker, I did as many interviews\r\nas I could fit it. I left for Maine on Christmas Eve of 1979, taking all my\r\n_TV Shopper_ stories with me, and flew to San Francisco on New Year's\r\nDay of 1980. Using my notes, I wrote up my final interviews during my\r\nearly months on the West Coast, which accounts for some of the 1980\r\npublication dates. Other stories dated 1980 were published first in 1979,\r\nthen reused; I have no record of their original dates.\r\n\r\nWhen my parents moved in 1988, they threw away my entire _TV\r\nShopper_ archive. Fortunately, Bruce Logan had saved copies of most of\r\nthe stories, and at my request, he photocopied them and sent them to in\r\n1990. About 10 stories were missing from his collection, and therefore\r\ncannot be included here. Among the lost interviews I remember are Soupy\r\nSales, Dave Marash, Gael Greene, Janis Ian, Joe Franklin and Barnard\r\nHughes.\r\n\r\nAfter 9/11, I began thinking a lot about New York, and started rereading\r\nsome of my old stories. My eye caught this statement by Paul Goldberger,\r\nthen the architecture critic for the _New York Times_: \"This is probably\r\nthe safest environment in the world to build a skyscraper.\" I realized that\r\nthe New York of today is quite differently from that of the late 1970s, and\r\nthought that a collection of my interviews might be of interest to a new\r\ngeneration of readers.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2005 I finished retyping, correcting, and fact-checking\r\nthe 100 stories. Three of my interviews -- Isaac Asimov, Alan Lomax and\r\nTom Wolfe -- were originally published in two different versions, one for\r\nthe _TV Shopper_ and a longer one for the _Westsider_, a weekly\r\ncommunity newspaper. I have included both versions here. Also, my\r\ninterview with Leonard Maltin was not a cover story, but a half-page\r\n\"Westside profile.\" It appears here because of Maltin's huge future\r\nsuccess as a writer, editor and TV personality.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my research, I uncovered a lot of information about what\r\nhappened to my interviewees after 1980. Many have died, some have\r\ngrown in fame, and some have virtually disappeared from public records.\r\nIn a future edition of this book, I hope to include that information in a\r\npostscript at the end of each story. In the meantime, I invite readers to\r\nsend me any information they have about these personalities by emailing\r\nme at sunreport@aol.com.\r\n\r\nMax Millard\r\nSan Francisco, California\r\nNovember 2005\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\n                             TABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER CLEVELAND AMORY\r\nAuthor, radio humorist, and president of the Fund for Animals\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER MAXENE ANDREWS\r\nAn Andrews Sister finds stardom as a solo\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LUCIE ARNAZ\r\nTo star in Neil Simon's new musical\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER ADRIEN ARPEL\r\nAmerica's best-selling beauty author\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ISAAC ASIMOV\r\nAuthor of 188 books\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER GEORGE BALANCHINE\r\nArtistic director of the New York City Ballet\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER CLIVE BARNES\r\nDrama and dance critic\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER FRANZ BECKENBAUER\r\nNorth America's most valuable soccer player\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER HIMAN BROWN\r\nCreator of the _CBS Radio Mystery Theater_\r\n\r\nFERRIS BUTLER\r\nCreator, writer and producer of _Waste Meat News_\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER SAMMY CAHN\r\nOscar-winning lyricist\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER HUGH CAREY\r\nGovernor of New York state\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER CRAIG CLAIBORNE\r\nFood editor of the _New York Times_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MARC CONNELLY\r\nActor, director, producer, novelist, and Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER TONY CRAIG\r\nStar of _The Edge of Night_\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER RODNEY DANGERFIELD\r\nThe comedian and the man\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JAN DE RUTH\r\nPartner of nudes and _Time_ covers\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MIGNON DUNN\r\nThe Met's super mezzo\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS JR.\r\nA man for all seasons\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LEE FALK\r\nCreator of The Phantom and Mandrake the Magician\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER BARRY FARBER\r\nRadio talkmaster and linguist\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER SUZANNE FARRELL\r\nStar of the New York City Ballet\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JULES FEIFFER\r\nScreenwriter for _Popeye the Sailor_\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER GERALDINE FITZGERALD\r\nActress, director and singer\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JOAN FONTAINE\r\nActress turns author with _No Bed of Roses_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER BETTY FRIEDAN\r\nFounder of the women's liberation movement\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ARTHUR FROMMER\r\nAuthor of _Europe on $10 a Day_\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER WILLIAM GAINES\r\nPublisher and founder of _Mad_ magazine\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER RALPH GINZBURG\r\nPublisher of _Moneysworth_\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER LILLIAN GISH\r\n78 years in show business\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MILTON GLASER\r\nDesign director of the new _Esquire_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER PAUL GOLDBERGER\r\nArchitecture critic for the _New York Times_\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER MILTON GOLDMAN\r\nBroadway's super agent\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER TAMMY GRIMES\r\nStar of _Father's Day_ at the American Place Theatre\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER DELORES HALL\r\nStar of _Your Arms Too Short to Box with God_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LIONEL HAMPTON\r\nKing of the Newport Jazz Festival\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER DAVID HAWK\r\nExecutive director of Amnesty International U.S.A.\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER WALTER HOVING\r\nChairman of Tiffany & Company\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JAY JACOBS\r\nRestaurant critic for _Gourmet_ magazine\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER RAUL JULIA\r\nStar of _Dracula_ on Broadway\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER BOB KANE\r\nCreator of Batman and Robin\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LENORE KASDORF\r\nStar of _The Guiding Light_\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER BRIAN KEITH\r\nBack on Broadway after 27 years\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER HAROLD KENNEDY\r\nAuthor of _No Pickle, No Performance_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ANNA KISSELGOFF\r\nDance critic for the _New York Times_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER GEORGE LANG\r\nOwner of the Cafe des Artistes\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER RUTH LAREDO\r\nLeading American pianist\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER STAN LEE\r\nCreator of Spiderman and the Incredible Hulk\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JOHN LEONARD\r\nBook critic for the _New York Times_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JOHN LINDSAY\r\nInternational lawyer\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ALAN LOMAX\r\nSending songs into outer space\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER PETER MAAS\r\nAuthor of _Serpico_ and _Made in America_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LEONARD MALTIN\r\nFilm historian and critic\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JEAN MARSH\r\nCreator and star of _Upstairs, Downstairs_\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JACKIE MASON\r\nCo-starring with Steve Martin in _The Jerk_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MALACHY McCOURT\r\nActor and social critic\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MEAT LOAF\r\nHottest rock act in town\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ANN MILLER\r\nCo-star of _Sugar Babies_\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER SHERRILL MILNES\r\nOpera superstar\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER CARLOS MONTOYA\r\nMaster of the flamenco guitar\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MELBA MOORE\r\nBroadway star releases ninth album\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MICHAEL MORIARTY\r\nStar of _Holocaust_ returns to Broadway in _G.R.

It could easily belong to a cartoon character or a top TV\r\npitchman, but it doesn't. It belongs to Cleveland Amory, an affable and\r\nrugged individualist who has been a celebrated writer for more than half\r\nof his 61 years. Amory is also a highly regarded lecturer and radio\r\nessayist: his one-minute humor spot, _Curmudgeon at Large_, is heard\r\ndaily from Maine to California. His latest novel, nearing completion, is\r\ndue to be published next fall.\r\n\r\n_TV Guide_ perhaps brought Amory his widest fame. He was the\r\nmagazine's star columnist from 1963 to 1976, when he gave it up in order\r\nto devote his time to other projects, especially the Fund for Animals, a\r\nnon-profit humane organization that he founded in 1967. He has served as\r\nthe group's president since the beginning; now it has 150,000 members\r\nacross the United States. Amory receives no pay for his involvement with\r\nthe organization.\r\n\r\nThe national headquarters of the Fund for Animals is a suite of rooms in\r\nan apartment building near Carnegie Hall. The central room is lined with\r\nbookshelves, and everywhere on the 25-foot walls are pictures and statues\r\nof animals. Amory enters the room looking utterly exhausted. He is a tall,\r\npowerful-looking man with a shock of greyish brown hair that springs\r\nfrom his head like sparks from an electrode. As we sit back to talk and his\r\ntwo pet cats walk about the office, his energy seems to recharge itself.\r\n\r\nAmory's quest to protect animals from needless cruelty began several\r\ndecades ago when, as a young reporter in Arizona, he wandered across\r\nthe border into Mexico and witnessed a bullfight. Shocked that people\r\ncould applaud the death agony of \"a fellow creature of this earth,\" he\r\nbegan to join various humane societies. Today he is probably the best\r\nknown animal expert in America. His 1974 best-seller, _Man Kind? Our\r\nIncredible War On Wildlife_, was one of only three books in recent years\r\nto be the subject of an editorial in the _New York Times_ -- the others\r\nbeing Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ and Ralph Nader's _Unsafe at Any\r\nSpeed_.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of people ask me, 'Why not do something about children, or old\r\npeople, or minorities?'\" he begins, lighting a cigarette and propping one\r\nfoot on the desk. \"My feeling is that there's enough misery out there for\r\nanybody to work at whatever he wants to. I think the mark of a civilized\r\nperson is how you treat what's beneath you. Most people do care about\r\nanimals. But you have to translate their feelings into action. ... We're\r\nfighting a lot of things -- the clubbing of the baby seals, the killing of\r\ndolphins by the tuna fishermen, the poisoning of animals. The leghold trap\r\nis illegal in 14 countries of the world, but only in five states in the U.S.\r\n\r\n\"The reason this fight is so hard is that man has an incredible ability to\r\nrationalize his cruelty. When they kill the seals, they say it's a humane\r\nway of doing it. But I don't see anything humane about clubbing a baby\r\nseal to death while his mother is watching, helpless.\r\n\r\n\"One of our biggest fights right now is to make the wolf our national\r\nmammal. There's only about 400 of them left in the continental United\r\nStates. The wolf is a very brave animal. It's monogamous, and it has great\r\nsensitivity.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his chief reasons for dropping his _TV Guide_ column, says\r\nAmory, was because \"after 15 years of trying to decide whether the Fonz\r\nis a threat to Shakespeare, I wanted to write about things that are more\r\nimportant than that.\" His latest novel, a satirical work that he considers\r\nthe finest piece of writing he has ever done, \"is basically a satire of club\r\nlife in America. ... I sent it down to a typist here, and it came back with\r\na note from the typist saying, 'I love it!' In all my years of writing, I\r\ndon't think I've ever had a compliment like that. So I sent the note to my\r\neditor along with the manuscript.\"\r\n\r\nAn expert chess player, he was long ranked number one at Manhattan's\r\nHarvard Club until his recent dethronement at the hands of a young\r\nwoman. \"I play Russians whenever I get a chance,\" he confides. \"I always\r\nlove to beat Russians. I want to beat them all.\" Once he played against\r\nViktor Korchnoi, the defected Soviet who narrowly lost to world\r\nchampion Anatoly Karpov this fall.\r\n\r\n\"I think he threw that final game,\" says Amory of Korchnoi's loss. \"He\r\ndidn't make a single threatening move. I think he was offered a deal to get\r\nthe kid and wife out. It was all set up from the beginning. I hate facts, so\r\nI don't want any facts to interfere with my thesis.\"\r\n\r\nBorn outside of Boston, he showed his writing talent early, becoming the\r\nyoungest editor ever at the _Saturday Evening Post_. His first book, _The\r\nProper Bostonians_, was published in 1947. \"Then I moved to New\r\nYork,\" he muses, \"because whenever I write about a place, I have to\r\nleave it.\" Nineteen years ago, he took on as his assistant a remarkable\r\nwoman named Marian Probst, who has worked with him ever since. Says\r\nAmory: \"She knows more about every project I've been involved with\r\nthan I know myself.\"\r\n\r\nA longtime Westsider, he enjoys dining at the Russian Tea Room (150 W.\r\n57th St.).\r\n\r\nThere are so many facets to Cleveland Amory's career and character that\r\nhe defies classification. In large doses, he can be extremely persuasive. In\r\nsmaller doses, he comes across as a sort of boon companion for\r\neveryman, who provides an escape from the woes of modern society\r\nthrough his devastating humor. For example, his off-the-cuff remark about\r\nPresident Carter:\r\n\r\n\"Here we have a fellow who doesn't know any more than you or I about\r\nhow to run the country. I'm surprised he did so well in the peanut\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER MAXENE ANDREWS\r\nAn Andrews Sister finds stardom as a solo\r\n\r\n2-2-80\r\n\r\nMaxene Andrews, riding high on the wave of her triumphant solo act that\r\nopened at the Reno Sweeney cabaret last November, is sitting in her dimly\r\nlit, antique-lined Eastside living room, talking about the foibles of show\r\nbusiness. As one of the Andrews Sisters, America's most popular vocal\r\ntrio of the 1940s, she made 19 gold records in the space of 20 years. But\r\nas a solo performer, she more or less failed in two previous attempts --\r\nfirst in the early 1950s, when her younger sister Patty temporarily left the\r\ngroup, and again in 1975, after her hit Broadway show _Over Here_\r\nclosed amid controversy. Not until 1979 did Miss Andrews bring together\r\nall the elements of success -- good choice of songs, interesting patter\r\nbetween numbers, and a first-rate accompanist. The result is an act that\r\nis nostalgic, moving, and musically powerful.\r\n\r\n\"For years, our career was so different than so many, because our fans\r\nnever forgot us,\" she recalls, beaming with matronly delight. \"I could\r\nwalk in anyplace in the years I wasn't working, and they'd say, 'Maxene\r\nAndrews -- the Andrews Sisters?' Everybody was sort of in awe. So I was\r\nalways treated like a star of some kind. But it's nice to work; it's a\r\nwonderful feeling to be in demand.\"\r\n\r\nShe is a bubbly, husky, larger-than-life character of 61 with ruddy cheeks\r\nand a firm handshake. Deeply religious, sincere, and outspoken as always,\r\nshe remains first and foremost an entertainer.\r\n\r\n\"I stick to the older, standard songs by great composers,\" says Maxene of\r\nher act. \"You know -- Rodgers and Hart, Irving Berlin. ... My partner is\r\nPhil Campanella, an extremely talented young man who plays the piano\r\nand sings harmony. ... All the talking I do between the songs is ad\r\nlibbing. I have never been successful at trying to do material that was\r\nwritten for me.\"\r\n\r\nShe's returning to Reno Sweeney on February 6 for a two-week\r\nengagement, then filming a TV show titled _G.I. Jive_ before taking her\r\nact to Miami and Key West. Nightclub work, she says in her high, bell\r\nclear voice, \"is not my future. I would like to get into concerts and I think\r\nthat's a possibility -- probably a year from now.\"\r\n\r\nLaVerne, the eldest of the sisters, died in 1967. Patty stopped speaking to\r\nMaxene five years ago because of salary disagreements for _Over Here_.\r\nThe contracts were negotiated separately, and when Maxene balked at\r\naccepting $1000 a week less than her sister, the national tour was abruptly\r\ncanceled.\r\n\r\n\"I never in my wildest dreams thought that we would separate, because\r\nwe've always been very close,\" says Maxene sadly. \"When people say,\r\n'You're feuding with your sister,' I say that's not the truth. Because it\r\ntakes two people to fight, and I'm not fighting anyone. She's just not\r\ntalking to me.\r\n\r\n\"It took me a long time to be able to handle the separation. I used to wake\r\nup every morning and say, 'What have I done?' But now I just throw it\r\nup to Jesus, and I leave it there. I hope and pray that one of these days we\r\ncan bring everything out in the open, and clear it up. I love Patty very\r\nmuch, and I'm very surprised that she's not out doing her act, because\r\nshe's very very talented. She's been doing the _Gong Show_, which I --\r\nit's none of my business, but I would highly disapprove of. I think it's\r\nsuch a terrible show.\"\r\n\r\nMaxene owns a house outside of Los Angeles, and was \"born again\" a\r\ncouple of years ago at the Church on the Way in Van Nuys, California.\r\nWhen she's on Manhattan's East Side, which is often, she shares the\r\napartment of Dr. Louis Parrish, an M.D. and psychiatrist whom she\r\ndescribes as \"a true Southern gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nThe Andrews Sisters, who recorded such hits as \"Bei Mir Bist Du\r\nSchoen,\" \"Rum and Coca Cola,\" \"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree,\"\r\n\"Apple Blossom Time,\" and \"Hold Tight,\" arrived in New York from\r\nMinneapolis in 1937 and took the city by storm with their wholesome,\r\nsugar-sweet harmonies and innovative arrangements. Soon they were\r\nmaking movies as well. _Buck Privates_ (1940, which featured Abbott and\r\nCostello and the song \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,\" was Universal's\r\nbiggest moneymaker until _Jaws_ came along in 1975. \"I didn't\r\nparticularly care for making movies,\" comments Maxene. \"I found it very\r\nboring and very repetitious, and certainly not very creative. But working\r\nwith Bud and Lou was a lot of fun.\"\r\n\r\nNow divorced, Maxene has a 33-year-old daughter named Aleda and a 31\r\nyear-old son, Peter, who live in Utah. She has written her autobiography,\r\nbut it hasn't been sold to a publisher \"because I refuse to write the kind\r\nof books that they want written today. Ever since the Christina Crawford\r\nbook came out, that's all the publishers want. ... I think the trend will\r\npass, because we're really getting saturated in cruelty and lust and\r\nwhatever else you want to call it.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about the changes in her life since her religious reawakening,\r\nMaxene says, \"Darling, everything has improved. My disposition has\r\nimproved. I used to be impossible for anybody to work with. ... I'm now\r\nreconciled to the feeling that I am never alone, and that in Him I have a\r\npartner, and that if I run into a problem that I can't solve, then I'm not\r\nsupposed to solve it -- because we're just mere mortals.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LUCIE ARNAZ\r\nTo star in Neil Simon's new musical\r\n\r\n9-9-78\r\n\r\nBad timing. That's what had plagued me ever since I had tried to get an\r\ninterview with Lucie Arnaz last June. Back then, I was supposed to get\r\ntogether with her downtown, but our meeting was canceled at the last\r\nminute. My second appointment, set for August 31 in her dressing room\r\njust before a performance of _Annie Get Your Gun_ at the Jones Beach\r\nTheatre in Wantagh, Long Island, now seemed in jeopardy as well. I was\r\nkept waiting nervously outside while the house manager insisted that Lucie\r\nwas engaged in \"a very important telephone call.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the young star finally emerged, her face beaming with delight,\r\nI found that my timing could not have been better. Lucie had just received\r\nofficial word that a major new Broadway role was hers. As we sat down\r\nto talk, Lucie was in one of those radiant moods that come only in times\r\nof triumph. She had been chosen for the female lead in a new musical,\r\n_They're Playing My Song_, which is scheduled to open in Los Angeles\r\nin December and on Broadway in February. The show has music by\r\nMarvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager. The book is written\r\nby Neil Simon.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a lousy auditioner -- at least, I thought I was,\" grinned Lucie. \"This\r\nnew musical will be probably the pinnacle of what I've been aiming for.\r\n... It's about a fairly successful lyricist who's not nearly as successful as\r\nthe composer she's going to work with. Neil Simon has always wanted to\r\ndo a play about songwriters. It's a very hip, pop musical. It doesn't have\r\nregular Broadway-type tunes.\"\r\n\r\nShe flopped back on the sofa touching my arm from time to time for\r\nemphasis, and chatted on in her mildly raspy voice. Finally she moved to\r\na seat in front of the mirror and invited me to keep talking while she put\r\non her makeup. There is a quality about her that suggests toughness, but\r\nthis impression melts away under her girlish charm. At 27, Lucie is\r\nalready an 11-year veteran of professional acting and singing. When she\r\nperformed at Jones Beach this summer, up to 8,000 people per night came\r\nto see her.\r\n\r\nLucie first transplanted herself from the West Coast to the West Side on\r\na full-time basis last winter, although, she admitted, \"I had a New York\r\napartment for four years which I would visit every couple of months. For\r\nsome sick reason, I really like New York. There's a lot of crazy people\r\ndoing strange things on the streets, but there's also a lot of creative forces\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\"I went to do an interview this morning for my radio show and it started\r\nraining. By the time I had walked six blocks I was looking terrible, and\r\nit suddenly occurred to me that I would never present myself like that in\r\nCalifornia. In New York, who gives a damn if you've got water on you\r\nwhen you come to work? On the West Coast, the things that aren't\r\nimportant they seem to put on pedestals.\" Her radio show, which she\r\nstarted this year, is a nationally syndicated five-minute interview spot\r\ncalled _Tune In With Lucie_.\r\n\r\n>From 1967 to 1972 she was a regular on her mother's TV show, _Here's\r\nLucy_. She has made countless guest appearances on other shows, and\r\nperformed lead roles in numerous musicals. Her parents, Lucille Ball and\r\nDesi Arnaz Sr., were divorced more than a decade ago and have both\r\nremarried.\r\n\r\n\"My mother was here for opening night, then she stayed a couple of days\r\nin New York. But she gets too lonely when my brother Desi and I go\r\naway for too long. He was here for most of the summer. He was doing\r\na movie called _How To Pick Up Girls_. He played the guy who\r\nsupposedly knew all about it -- one of the two stars. He said, \"It's funny,\r\nI meet girls on the street, and New York has the most beautiful girls in\r\nthe world, and when they ask me what I'm doing here and I tell them the\r\nname of the movie, they walk away and say, 'You dirty toad!'\" Desi also\r\nplays the groom in the new Robert Altman film, _A Wedding_.\r\n\r\n\"My father is now putting an album together of the music that was\r\nrecorded for the old _Lucy Show_. Salsa music is coming back now, so\r\nhe's been asked to make an album of those tapes.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of her hobbies, Lucie noted that \"recently I started to build a\r\ndarkroom in my house. The key word is started. It's hard to get the time.\r\n... And I have been writing songs for the last couple of years. I'm a\r\nlyricist. I've sung them on things like _Mike Douglas_ and _Dinah_.\"\r\n\r\nShe enjoys all of New York, though at one time \"the East Side gave me\r\nthe ooga boogas. Then I found a couple of places there that were nice.\"\r\nOn the West Side, she likes to dine at La Cantina, Victor's Cafe, and\r\nYing, all on Columbus Avenue near 71st and 72nd Streets.\r\n\r\nWhen the five-minute warning sounded in her dressing room, Lucie had\r\nto turn me out, but not before she divulged her philosophy about show\r\nbusiness. \"Am I ambitious?\" she echoed. \"I don't know. There are people\r\nwho are willing to really knock the doors down and do just about anything\r\nto get there. I'm not like that. Even now, when I go to the market, people\r\ncome up to me and say, 'Aren't you. ... ?' So I can imagine what it\r\nwould be like to be a superstar. No, I'm not really looking forward to\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER ADRIEN ARPEL\r\nAmerica's best-selling beauty author\r\n\r\n3-29-80\r\n\r\nAs a young girl in Englewood, New Jersey, Adrien Arpel was determined\r\nthat one day she would transform herself into a beautiful woman. After\r\nhaving her nose bobbed, she began to pester the ladies behind every\r\ncosmetic counter she could reach, and by the time she graduated from\r\nhigh school at 17, she knew more than they did. That same year she\r\nopened a small cosmetics shop in her hometown with $400 earned from\r\nbaby-sitting. Today, at 38, she is the president of a $12 million-a-year\r\ncompany selling more than 100 beauty products throughout the U.S. and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nNot content with mere business success, she recently turned her talent to\r\nwriting her first book, Adrien Arpel's Three-Week Crash\r\nMakeover/Shapeover Beauty Program (1977). It was on the _New York\r\nTimes'_ best-seller list for six months, and is still selling briskly in\r\npaperback. Miss Arpel received $275,000 from Pocket Books for the\r\nreprint rights -- the most ever for a beauty book.\r\n\r\n\"I have always been a rebel,\" she proclaims regally, dressed in a stylish\r\nEdwardian outfit with padded shoulders at her midtown office. Quite\r\nheavily made up, with hot pink lipstick and a Cleopatra hairdo, she looks\r\nconsiderably younger than her age. The strident quality of her voice is\r\nreminiscent of a Broadway chorus girl's, yet is delivered in a crisp,\r\nbusinesslike manner. During the interview she rarely smiles or strays from\r\nthe question being asked. For some reason, she declines to say much\r\nabout her new book, _How to Look 10 Years Younger_, which is\r\nscheduled for publication in April. Instead, she stresses the simple,\r\ncommon-sense rules about beauty that have guided her career from the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nProbably her two most important innovations are her exclusive use of\r\nnature-based, chemical-free products (chosen from leading European\r\nhealth spas) and her policy of try-before-you-buy makeup. Complimentary\r\nmakeup is offered every time a customer gets a facial at one of the\r\nhundreds of Adrien Arpel salons, such as those on the first floor of\r\nBloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nWhenever she opens a new salon, Adrien spends the entire day on her\r\nfeet, doing upwards of 35 facials with her own pale, delicate hands.\r\n\r\nUpon being complimented for her attire, Miss Arpel gasps, \"Thank you!\"\r\nwith schoolgirlish delight. There is something almost surreal in her\r\ncreamy white complexion. \"I think sunbathing is absolutely deadly, and\r\nthat there is no reason in the world for a woman to sunbathe,\" she says.\r\nMoments later, she admits that \"high heel shoes are not very good for\r\nyou,\" but that she wears them anyway, \"because they're very fashionable.\r\nThey are something that really can be a problem -- if they're pitched\r\nwrong. If you have a good shoe and it's pitched well, you shouldn't have\r\na problem\"\r\n\r\nDoes she think it would be a good idea for women to give up high heels\r\naltogether? \"No, no. I don't think you'll ever get women to give up\r\nfashion. So we can tell what's problems, what's really hazardous, what's\r\ngoing to be injurious to your health, and what's going to just hurt a little\r\nbit.\"\r\n\r\nShe never thought of writing a book until about four years ago, says\r\nArpel, because \"every second when I was away from my business, I spent\r\nwith my daughter. Now my daughter's 16 and a half, and has a boyfriend,\r\nand goes out, and doesn't want to spend every minute with me. This all\r\nstarted when she was about 13.\" Adrien and her husband, manufacturer\r\nRonald Newman, moved to the New York metropolitan area right after\r\nthey were married in 1961, and acquired an Upper East Side apartment\r\nlast summer.\r\n\r\nFor her own health and beauty regimen, Adrien begins her typical day\r\nwith jumping rope. She thinks weight training for women is \"terrific,\" but\r\nconsiders jogging the best all-around exercise. \"Now, jogging has its\r\nnegatives. I get up very early in the morning, and if you jog while it's still\r\ndark out, it can be dangerous. I also have long hair, and you have to wash\r\nyour hair after you jog. So for someone that works, I find that I can only\r\ndo it three days a week.\"\r\n\r\nShe has a facial twice weekly. \"Facials are not luxuries. They are\r\nnecessities to peel off dead surface skin. ... Air pollution is the reason. If\r\nit wears away stone on buildings, think what it can do to the skin.\" A\r\nfacial, she explains, consists of \"all different sorts of hand massages to\r\ndeep-cleanse the skin with coconut-like milk, or some sort of sea kelp\r\ncleanser. Then there's a skin vacuum which takes blackheads out --\r\nelectric brushes with honey and almond scrubs which clean out the pores.\r\nAnd at the end, a mask. Nature-based again -- orange jelly, sea mud, or\r\nspearmint.\"\r\n\r\nArpel believes that a woman's makeup should be largely determined by\r\nher profession. She reveals a humorous side when asked whether a woman\r\nstockbroker, for example, should always dress conservatively. \"Well, if\r\nshe was wearing a see-through blouse and no bra in her office, I'd\r\ncertainly think she had poor taste,\" she laughs.\r\n\r\nA nonsmoker who consumes little alcohol, she confesses to at least one\r\nvice: \"I drink two cups of coffee in the morning, sometimes more. Also\r\nnot wonderfully good for you -- but I never said I was a hundred percent\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ISAAC ASIMOV\r\nAuthor of 188 books\r\n\r\n10-29-77\r\n\r\nIn 1965, when the Science Fiction Writers of America held a national\r\nconvention to vote on the best science fiction ever published in this\r\ncountry, they sifted through hundreds of nominations dating back to the\r\n1920s before coming up with the winners. _Nightfall_ (1941) received the\r\nmost votes for a short story and the _Foundation_ trilogy won for the best\r\nseries of novels. The author of both works: Westsider Isaac Asimov.\r\n\r\nHad Asimov died 25 years ago, his fame would still be secure. But he\r\nremains more active than ever. He is, among other things, one of the most\r\nprolific authors in the world, publishing an average of one book and three\r\nor four magazine articles per month.\r\n\r\nHe is sitting at an electric typewriter in his West 66th Street penthouse\r\nwhen the doorman informs him that two visitors have arrived. Asimov is\r\nexpecting a single reporter; but he says OK, so my roommate John\r\nCimino and I get on the elevator. We stop at the 33rd floor. Asimov, clad\r\nin his undershirt, meets us at the door, hangs up our coats, and takes us\r\ninto the living room adjacent to his working area. Along one wall is a\r\nglass-enclosed bookcase containing the 188 books Asimov has written in\r\nhis 40-year literary career.\r\n\r\n\"This is my section of the apartment,\" he says. \"The blinds are down\r\nbecause I always work by artificial light.\" I tell him that John has come\r\nalong to ask questions about science -- Asimov is an expert in more than\r\n20 scientific disciplines -- while I will be asking about science fiction\r\nAsimov complies, and after about 10 minutes, he opens us completely and\r\ngives each answer with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nHe has lost a little weight recently, and in fact had a mild heart attack\r\nearlier this year, but Dr. Asimov is as creative as ever -- perhaps more\r\nso. One of his latest projects is _Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction\r\nMagazine_. It first appeared on the newsstands early in 1977 and has\r\nsince built up a broad readership throughout the U.S., Canada and Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\"It was the idea of Joel Davis of Davis Publications,\" says Asimov. \"He\r\npublishes _Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine_, _Alfred Hitchcock's\r\nMystery Magazine_, and many others. He decided that science fiction was\r\ndoing well and that he wanted a science fiction magazine -- something\r\nwith the name of someone, like Ellery Queen. ... He asked me if I was\r\ninterested. ... I wasn't really, because I had neither the time nor the\r\ninclination to edit the magazine.\"\r\n\r\nAsimov found the time. He and Davis worked out a formula for the\r\nauthor to lend his name and picture to the magazine cover and to become\r\nthe editorial director. Asimov writes the editorials and some of the fiction,\r\nanswers readers' letters and helps with the story selection. George\r\nScithers, the editor, has a major role in deciding the magazine's contents.\r\n\r\n_Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine_ began as a quarterly and if all\r\ngoes well, will soon become a monthly. Some of its contributors are\r\nwriters in their 20s who are publishing their first stories. Containing many\r\nillustrations and almost no advertising, the 200-page magazine is available\r\nat numerous Westside newsstands for $1.\r\n\r\nBorn in Russia and raised in Brooklyn, Asimov graduated from college\r\nand published his first short story while in his teens. For many years, he\r\ntaught biochemistry at Boston University. In 1970, he returned to New\r\nYork and settled on the West Side. He is married to a psychiatrist and\r\npsychoanalyst who practices under her maiden name of Dr. Janet Jeppson;\r\nher office is on the opposite end of the apartment. She too is a writer,\r\nhaving published a science fiction novel and some stories.\r\n\r\n\"The West Side, as far as I'm concerned, has more good restaurants than\r\nany other place on earth, though I have not been to Paris,\" says Asimov,\r\nwho hates flying. He made a trip to Europe last year on the Queen\r\nElizabeth II -- and came back on the return voyage. \"It wasn't a\r\nvacation,\" he says. \"I gave two talks each way and I wrote a book.\"\r\n\r\nThe IRS, he says, cannot believe that he doesn't take vacations. \"In the\r\nlast seven years,\" he testifies, there has been only one time -- two days in\r\nJune of 1975 -- that I went on a trip and didn't do a talk. And even then,\r\nI took some paper with me and worked on a murder mystery. You see,\r\na vacation is doing what you want to do and to stop doing what you have\r\nto do. .. But I like what I, so I'm on vacation 365 days a year.\"\r\n\r\nAsimov's biggest writing project these days is his massive autobiography,\r\nwhich he expects to finish by the end of the year. \"It will probably be in\r\ntwo volumes,\" says Asimov, grinning, \"which is unreasonable,\r\nconsidering that I have led a very quiet life and not much has happened\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nISAAC ASIMOV: LITERARY WORKAHOLIC\r\n\r\nfrom _The Westsider_, 12-1-77\r\n\r\nMorning has come to the West side. In a penthouse high above 66th\r\nStreet, a middle-aged man enters his study, pulled down the shades and\r\nfills the room with artificial light. Reference books at his elbow, he sits\r\ndown at his electric typewriter and begins to tap out sentences at the rate\r\nof 90 words per minute. Fourteen hours later, his day's work complete,\r\nDr. Isaac Asimov turns off the machine.\r\n\r\nIn such a way has Asimov spent most of the past seven years, ever since\r\nhe moved to the West Side from Boston. In a 40-year literary career\r\nstretching back to his teens, he has written and published 188 books,\r\nincluding science fiction, science fact, history, mystery, and even guides\r\nto Shakespeare and the Bible. Asimov has also written more than 1,000\r\nmagazine and newspaper articles, book introductions and speeches.\r\n\r\nThough his pen has never been silent since he sold his first piece of fiction\r\nto Amazing Stories in 1939, Asimov is now enjoying the most productive\r\nperiod of his career. Since 1970 he has written 85 books -- an average of\r\none per month. He does not dictate his books; nor does he have a\r\nsecretary. Asimov personally answers some 70 fan letters per week, and\r\nhe gives speeches frequently. He also finds time for the press.\r\n\r\nThe following interview took place on a morning late in October in the\r\nsitting room adjoining his study. Along one wall was a bookcase\r\napproximately 6 by 8 feet containing Asimov's collected works.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Dr. Asimov, have you set any goals for yourself for the next 10\r\nyears or so?\r\n\r\nAsimov: I'm afraid I don't generally look ahead. Right now my\r\nautobiography is the big project ... . I have no ambition whatsoever\r\noutside of my writing. I expect to write as long as I stay alive.\r\n\r\nQ:        Could you say something about your autobiography?\r\n\r\nA:        It's longer than I thought it would be. As soon as I get you out I'm\r\ngoing to deliver pages 1374 to 1500 to Doubleday. I'm hoping to get it\r\nfinished by the end of the year ... . It will probably be in two volumes --\r\nwhich is unreasonable, considering that I've led a very quiet life and not\r\nmuch has happened to me. I guess the only thing is that I tend to go on\r\nand on when I'm on my favorite subject.\r\n\r\nQ:        What made you choose the West Side to live?\r\n\r\nA:        I can't honestly say I chose the West Side. When I came to New\r\nYork in 1970, I lived where I could, which happened to be the West Side.\r\nBut now that I'm here, I like it. I was brought up in New York and went\r\nto Columbia ... . I've always identified myself with Manhattan. My\r\npublishers -- almost all of them are in Manhattan. Taxis are available at\r\nany time. I West Side, as far as I'm concerned, has more good restaurants\r\nwithin walked distance than any other place on earth, though I have not\r\nbeen to Paris. I have learned to tolerate the traffic and the pollution and\r\nthe litter. When I go to the East Side it looks dull by comparison.\r\n\r\nQ:        I see that your science fiction story \"Nightfall\" has been made into\r\na record Albert. And I also remember the movie version of your\r\n_Fantastic Voyage_. Do you have plans for making movies or recordings\r\nout of your other science fiction works -- for example, the _Foundation_\r\nseries?\r\n\r\nA:        Fantastic Voyage was the other way around; my book was made from\r\nthe picture ... . The Foundation series has been turned into a radio show\r\nin Great Britain. There have been other stories of mine which were turned\r\ninto radio shows in the 1950s. I have expensive pictures under option.\r\nWhether anything will turn up in the future I don't know, and to be\r\nperfectly honest, I don't care. I am perfectly happy with my writing career\r\nas it is. I have complete control over my books. When something is put\r\ninto the movies it can be changed, often for the worse. I might get nothing\r\nout of it both money, and I have enough money to get by.\r\n\r\nQ:        How to did the new Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction magazine get\r\nstarted?\r\n\r\nA:        It was the idea of Joel Davis of Davis Publications. He publishes\r\nEllery Queen's Mystery Magazine, Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine,\r\nand many others. He decided that science fiction was doing well and he\r\nwanted a science fiction magazine -- something with the name of someone.\r\nHe had seen me, because I had brought in some stories for Ellery Queen.\r\nHe asked me if I was interested ... . I wasn't really, because I had neither\r\nthe time nor the inclination to edit the magazine. So he hired George\r\nScithers to be the editor and made me the editorial director ... . It's been\r\na quarterly to begin with. The fifth issue, which will go on sale in\r\nDecember, will be the first of the bimonthly issues. After the second year\r\nit will be a monthly if all things go well.\r\n\r\nQ:        Could you tell me something about your family life?\r\n\r\nA:        My wife is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, and she has her office\r\nin the other end of this apartment. She's the director of training at the\r\nWilliam Alanson White Institute on West 74th Street. The name she\r\npractices under is Dr. Janet O. Jeppson -- that's her maiden name. It's\r\nMrs. Asimov but Dr. Jeppson. She's also a writer. She's published a\r\nscience fiction novel and a few short stories and has a mystery novel she's\r\ntrying to sell.\r\n\r\nQ:        Do you stimulate her writing by your own work?\r\n\r\nA:        If anything, I inhibit it. She was a writer for years before she met\r\nme. If she weren't married to me, she would probably write more. In fact,\r\nI encourage her. But it's hard when your husband writes as fast as he can\r\ntype and publishes everything he writes.\r\n\r\nQ:        Do you have any children?\r\n\r\nA:        Yes, I have two children by my first marriage -- a boy 26 and a girl\r\n22. He's working at a gas station and the girl is a senior at Boston College\r\n... . When she left home at 15, I said the only thing I ask of her was not\r\nto smoke. So she's done that. What else she does, I don't know, but she\r\ndoesn't smoke.\r\n\r\nQ:        I realize that you are considered an authority in at least 20 branches\r\nof science. Have you ever done in original scientific research?\r\n\r\nQ:        I am still assistant professor of biochemistry at Boston University,\r\nthough I no longer teach. Yes, I did original research from 1946 to 1958\r\n... . I could not with honesty say I accomplished anything of importance.\r\nI am not a first-rank researcher -- perhaps not even a second-rank\r\nresearcher. It surprised me too. I found that my heart was in writing.\r\n\r\nQ:        Where do you go for vacation?\r\n\r\nA:        I don't go on vacation really. I sometimes go off to do a talk and I\r\ntry to make that a little vacation. I work. In the last seven years there has\r\nbeen only one time -- two days in June of 1975 -- that I didn't do a talk.\r\nAnd even then I took some paper with me and worked on a murder\r\nmystery. You see, a vacation is doing what you want to do and to stop\r\ndoing what you have to do ... . But I like what I do, so I'm on vacation\r\n365 days a year. If I had to play volleyball, fish, etcetera, that would be\r\nreal work. In fact, the IRS can't believe I don't take vacations. If they can\r\nfigure out how to write one book a month and still take vacations ... . I\r\ndo travel, although I never fly. Last year I crossed the ocean on the QEII\r\nwithout stopping. But, I gave two talks each way and I wrote a book.\r\n\r\nQ:        Since you live week three blocks of Lincoln Center, do you attend the\r\nperforming arts?\r\n\r\nA:        I am a very ill-rounded person. I am fascinated by what I do. And\r\nwhat I have done is to try to take all knowledge for my province, but I\r\nhave tended to concentrate on science, mathematics and history. In regard\r\nto art, I can't even say I know what I like.\r\n\r\nQ:        What do you think of abolishing mandatory retirement, as Congress\r\nis considering? What will it like when people keep working indefinitely?\r\n\r\nA:        That was the condition until the 1930s. This forced retirement is a\r\nproduct of the Great Depression. We're moving back to situation that has\r\nalways existed for mankind, which is to let people work as long as they\r\ncan. If the birthrate continues to go down the percentage of young people\r\nwill be smaller. I think that computerization and automation will alter\r\ncompletely the concept of what is work. We're not going to think of jobs\r\nthe same way as we used to.\r\n\r\nQ:        Do you think you could ever retire?\r\n\r\nA:        There might well come a time, if I live long enough, when I can no\r\nlonger write publishable material. Then I will have to write for my own\r\namusement. Rex Stout's last book was written when he was 88 years old.\r\nP.G. Wodehouse was writing pretty well in his early 90s. Agatha Christie\r\nwas falling off in her 80s ... . I had a heart attack this year. I might keep\r\nwriting for another 30 years. But if for some reason I am no longer able\r\nto write, then it will certainly take all the terrors of dying away, so there\r\nwill be that silver lining ... . So far, I detect no falling off of my abilities.\r\nIn fact, this year my story \"The Bicentennial Man\" won all the awards.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything also you'd like to ask me?\" Said Asimov when I had\r\nrun out of questions. At that moment the telephone rang: he told his caller\r\nthat no, he would, regrettably, be unable to accept an invitation to speak\r\nat Virginia because it was too far to go by grain. \"It's more my loss than\r\nyours,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWhen I assured Asimov that there were no more questions, he disappeared\r\ninto his study and emerged with a copy of his latest science fiction book,\r\nThe Bicentennial Man and Other Stories. He signed it and presented it to\r\nme. As he walked me to the elevator he took a peek at his watch. His\r\nparting comment was: Let's see, I have to be downtown at 11:30. That\r\ngives me 1:30 minutes to dress and 10 minutes to write.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER GEORGE BALANCHINE\r\nArtistic director of the New York City Ballet\r\n\r\n11-26-77\r\n\r\nTo some people he is known as the Shakespeare of dance -- a title that he\r\nprobably deserves more than anyone else now living. But to his friends\r\nand colleagues, he is simply \"Mr. B\" -- George Balanchine, the ageless\r\nRussian-born and trained choreographic genius whose zest for living is\r\nmatched only by his humility and his sense of humor.\r\n\r\nBalanchine has almost single-handedly transplanted ballet to American soil\r\nand made it flourish. What's more, he has played the central role in\r\nmaking New York the dance capital of the world, which it undeniably is\r\ntoday for both classical and modern dance.\r\n\r\nNow in his 30th consecutive year as artistic director of the New York City\r\nBallet, Mr. B. shows no signs of slowing down. He continues to direct\r\nmost of the dances for his 92-member company and to create new\r\nchoreographic works of daring originality. He continues to teach at the\r\nSchool of American Ballet, which he cofounded in 1934 with Lincoln\r\nKirstein. And Balanchine can still, when he chooses, write out the parts\r\nfor all the instruments of the orchestra. Yet he thinks of himself more as\r\na craftsman than a creator, and often compares his work to that of a cook\r\nor cabinetmaker -- two crafts, by the way, in which he is rather skilled.\r\n\r\nI meet George Balanchine backstage at the New York State Theatre during\r\nan intermission of one of the season's first ballets. It's not hard to guess\r\nwhich man is Balanchine from a distance because, as usual, he is\r\nsurrounded by young dancers. When he turns to face me, I see that he is\r\ndressed simply but with a touch of European elegance. The man is small\r\nof stature and quite frail in appearance. His English is strongly accented\r\nyet easy to understand. A smile seems to be forever playing on his lips,\r\nand when he converses with someone, he gives that person his full,\r\nundivided attention.\r\n\r\n\"Why has dance become so popular in New York?\" He gazes at me from\r\nthe depths of his eyes.\"I don't know why. People get used to us. It took\r\n30 years to train New York,\" he says with feeling. \"Maybe you can train\r\nLos Angeles. You cannot train Boston. You cannot train Philadelphia --\r\nthere are too many big men with big cigars.\"\r\n\r\nSoon he is improvising on the theme. \"Certainly New York is\r\nrepresentative of America. All America should pay taxes in New York to\r\nmake it beautiful. Because in Europe, everybody wants to be in New York\r\nto show off. ... I think that I will suggest to senators and presidents and\r\neverybody to pay taxes to New York.\"\r\n\r\nMr. B, who left his native St. Petersburg in 1924 and spent the next nine\r\nyears working as a ballet master throughout Europe, was persuaded by the\r\nAmerican dance connoisseur Lincoln Kirstein to come to the U.S. in\r\n1933. Since then, Balanchine has toured the world with the New York\r\nCity Ballet. He finds the home crowd, however, to be the most\r\nappreciative.\r\n\r\n\"We are here 25 weeks,\" he explains. \"It's always packed. In Paris, you\r\ncannot last two weeks. In Los Angeles, in London, they do not like the\r\ndance so much as here. In San Francisco, there were five people in the\r\naudience. We showed them everything. They don't care. They're snobs.\r\nThey only want a name. In New York, it's different. In New York, they\r\nlike the thing for itself.\"\r\n\r\nBalanchine does not write down his dances. How, then, does he remember\r\nsuch works as _Prodigal Son_, which he created almost 50 years ago and\r\nrevived this season for the New York City Ballet? \"How do you\r\nremember prayers?\" he says in response. \"You just remember. Like\r\nPepperidge Farm. I know Pepperidge Farm. I remember everything.\"\r\n\r\nHe dislikes excessive terminology. \"I used to be a dance director,\" he says\r\nin mock lament. \"Now I have become a choreographer. Choreographer is\r\nthe wrong title. Because dance is like poetry, see?\"\r\n\r\n_Prodigal Son_, in which the biblical story is danced out dramatically, is\r\nan example of a ballet with a plot. But the majority of Balanchine's works\r\nare based purely on music and movement. \"The literary thing does not\r\nalways work,\" he says. \"You cannot move. There's very few stories you\r\ncan do.\"\r\n\r\nTchaikovsky and Stravinsky are the composers he most likes to use for\r\nnew dance works. The late Igor Stravinsky, a fellow Russian expatriate\r\nwho was his longtime friend and collaborator, once described Balanchine's\r\nchoreography as \"a series of dialogues perfectly complimentary to and\r\ncoordinated with the dialogues of the music.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his fondness for Russian composers, Balanchine has no\r\nhesitation in naming Fred Astaire as his favorite dancer. \"No, I don't use\r\nhis ideas because he's an individual.\" says Balanchine. \"You cannot use\r\nhis ideas because only he can dance them. There is nobody like that.\r\nPeople are not like that anymore.\"\r\n\r\nA resident of West 67th Street, Balanchine shows even more than his\r\nusual exuberance when speaking of the West Side. \"It's the best side. It's\r\nlike the Rive Gauche (in Paris). We have the best hotels, like the Empire,\r\nthe best restaurants -- Le Poulailler (W. 65th St.) has such good French\r\ncooking.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no strikes here, nothing,\" he continues, grinning widely.\r\n\"Everybody's very nice, friendly. They help each other. I invite\r\neverybody on the East Side to come here. They don't come because\r\nthey're snobs. The West Side? It's the cleanest side. Also there is no\r\ncrime here. There's no police here.\"\r\n\r\ndied 4-30-83, born 1-22-04.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER CLIVE BARNES\r\nDrama and dance critic\r\n\r\n10-1-77\r\n\r\nHe's still the most famous drama critic in America, if not the world.\r\n\r\nHis name has not yet disappeared from the subway walls or from the signs\r\nin front of the theatres along Broadway. And even though Clive Barnes\r\nwas recently replaced as the _New York Times'_ drama critic, he remains\r\nthe most-quoted authority in the newspaper ads. He is still the _Times'_\r\ndance critic. He still does his daily radio spot on theatre for WQXR\r\nRadio. He still lectures around the country and writes a column for the\r\n_London Times_. At 50, Barnes does not mind the slightly calmer pace\r\nhis life has taken.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why I was replaced,\" he says. \"Papers have these policy\r\ndecisions. I suppose they wanted a change. They wanted to split the two\r\ndesks, dance and drama.\"\r\n\r\nA refined, affable Englishman, Clive Barnes welcomes me into his West\r\nEnd Avenue home and invites me to sit down and have some coffee for\r\nfive minutes while he puts the finishing touches on an article. His slim,\r\nattractive wife Trish and his 15-year-old son Christopher talk to him while\r\nhe works. Soon the article is finished and he is relaxed in an armchair,\r\nready to answer questions. He holds a pen in his lap and occasionally\r\nclicks it as we talk.\r\n\r\n\"Really, I much prefer New York to London,\" says Barnes, who spent the\r\nfirst 38 years of his life in the British capital. \"I'll never leave New York,\r\never. When I first came here visiting before I came here to live, I adored\r\nit. It's just been a very long love affair between myself and the city.\"\r\n\r\nBorn the son of a London ambulance driver, Barnes won a scholarship to\r\nOxford University, and while a student there began to write reviews on\r\ntheatre and dance. Following graduation, he worked in city planning for\r\n10 years while moonlighting as a critic of theatre, dance, films and music.\r\nThus he built up a reservoir of knowledge in all the major performing\r\narts. In 1965, several years after Barnes got into full-time journalism, he\r\nwas doing such an impressive job as dance critic for the _London Times_\r\nthat the _New York Times_ made him a handsome salary offer to fill the\r\nsame role for them. Two years later the _Times_ offered him the post of\r\ndrama critic as well. Barnes kept the dual role until this year, when the\r\n\"new\" _New York Times_ asked him to concentrate strictly on dance.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly American dance is the most important in the world, and has\r\nbeen for at least 25 years,\" he says. \"The reason for this is that you have\r\na very strong classical tradition, as well as a very strong modern dance\r\ntradition. This is the only country in the world that has these two\r\ntraditions, and they intermesh, so that you have George Balanchine on one\r\nside and Martha Graham on the other. This means that American dance\r\nis astonishingly rich.\"\r\n\r\nBarnes feels that Americans' television-viewing habits have made them\r\nmore appreciative of the subtleties of dance movement: \"That same kind\r\nof visual orientation that has made spectator sports what they are spins\r\noff, and spreads over to things like dance.\" He notes that dance in New\r\nYork appeals more to the young -- to people who have been reared on\r\ntelevision. Broadway audiences, on the other hand, \"tend to be\r\nmenopausal, and opera audiences to be geriatric.\"\r\n\r\nBarnes finds the West Side the ideal place to live because of its proximity\r\nto his work. Trish, herself an expert on dance, usually accompanies him\r\nto opening-night performances. \"We can get to any Broadway theatre in\r\n10 minutes,\" he says, \"or walk to Lincoln Center. I can get to the paper\r\nin about 10 minutes. The West Side has changed a little over the years.\r\nI think it's gotten rather nice.\"\r\n\r\nOn nights off, Barnes enjoys going to the Metropolitan Opera or to a\r\nmovie. His son Christopher loves rock music and hates drama. He also\r\nhas a 14-year-old daughter, Maya. The family enjoys dining at many\r\nrestaurants in the Lincoln Center area, including Le Poulailler on 65th\r\nStreet near Columbus.\r\n\r\nI ask Barnes if he can think of any plays that have been forced to close\r\nbecause of unkind reviews. \"That would presume it was an important play\r\nwhich the critics misunderstood and killed,\" he says. \"I don't think this\r\nhas actually happened. A play that gets awful notices by everyone is not\r\nthe victim of a vast critical conspiracy. It's usually a bad play. Harold\r\nPinter's _The Birthday Party_ got bad notices in London but it recovered\r\nand went on and became successful.\"\r\n\r\nFor those who miss Barnes' views on theatre in the _Times_, his radio\r\nbroadcast can be heard on WQXR (1560 AM and 96.3 FM) Monday\r\nthrough Friday, right after the 11 p.m. news.\r\n\r\nTrish, Clive's biggest supporter, has no complaints about being the wife\r\nof a celebrity. \"It's very enjoyable, actually,\" she says with a wide smile.\r\n\"You meet fascinating people and see all the best things there are to see.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER FRANZ BECKENBAUER\r\nNorth America's most valuable soccer player\r\n\r\n8-5-78\r\n\r\nLast October, when Brazilian soccer virtuoso Pel played his final game\r\nas a professional, nearly 76,000 fans filed into Giant Stadium in East\r\nRutherford, New Jersey to bid farewell to the man who had almost single\r\nhandedly transformed soccer into a major American sport. It was a fitting\r\ncap to Pel's career that his team, the Cosmos, won the North American\r\nSoccer League championship last season over 23 other teams.\r\n\r\nBut while the Brazilian superstar was reaping most of the publicity, one\r\nof his teammates, Franz Beckenbauer, was quietly getting things done. It\r\nwas probably he, more than anyone else, who won the title for the\r\nCosmos -- not by scoring goals, but by controlling the midfield with his\r\npinpoint touch passes and setting up the offense to go in for the shot.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1977, he shocked the sports world by quitting his West German\r\nteam, Bayern Munich, and signing a $2.8 million contract to play with the\r\nCosmos for four years. And though he missed one-third of the 1977\r\nseason, Franz still received last year's Most Valuable Player award for a\r\nleague encompassing 600 players from around the world. This season\r\nagain, thanks largely to his efforts, the Cosmos clinched their division title\r\nand are a heavy favorite to repeat their victory in the Soccer Bowl -- the\r\nSuper Bowl of soccer. This year the Soccer Bowl will be held in Giant\r\nStadium on August 27. To be in that game, the Cosmos must first win in\r\nthe playoffs, which begin on August 8.\r\n\r\nBeckenbauer is so famous in Germany that he finds it impossible to lead\r\na private life there. His fame is well deserved: Franz starred for the West\r\nGerman national team in the 1966 World Cup finals and the 1970\r\nsemifinals, and captained the team when it won the World Cup in 1974.\r\nDuring his 12 seasons with Bayern Munich of the German Soccer League,\r\nhe was named German Footballer of the Year four times and European\r\nFootballer of the Year twice, and was runner-up on two other occasions.\r\n\r\nBut Franz is somewhat of a quiet, shy man, who does not like the\r\nlimelight. In New York he can be himself, and walk the streets\r\nundisturbed, thinking about his wife and three children in Switzerland,\r\nwho will be joining him this month for a long visit.\r\n\r\nI meet Franz on a July afternoon after a practice at Giant Stadium. As we\r\nsit talking in the locker room, many of his teammates walk by and wave\r\nto him or call his name. He is an extremely popular fellow both on and\r\noff the field -- which explains why 72,000 people showed up for a game\r\nlast May commemorating Franz Beckenbauer Day. With his courtly\r\nmanners, he has rightfully earned the nickname \"Kaiser Franz.\"\r\n\r\nHe could speak almost no English when he arrived in New York less than\r\ntwo years ago at the age of 31, but has learned remarkably quickly. \"My\r\nmind was, soccer in the United States, it's easier to play. But it's not so\r\neasy as I expect,\" he says, in his slightly hesitant but perfectly\r\nunderstandable speech. \"You have so different things, like Astroturf. You\r\nhave to play in the summertime. It's so hot. You have to make big trips,\r\nlike to Los Angeles. Sometimes it's more difficult to play here than in\r\nEurope.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked to compare soccer with American football, he says, \"You\r\ncan't compare. It's a much different sport. As an American footballer,\r\nyou must be not a normal man. You must be maybe 200 pounds, and 6\r\nfoot 3, 6 foot 4 or 5. Everybody can play soccer -- big, tall, small -- if he\r\nis skilled enough, if he has the brain to play.\r\n\r\n\"I started when I was 3, 4, 5 years old. I don't know exactly. But you\r\nknow, after the war, nobody has money. Soccer is the cheapest sport. No\r\ncourts, nothing. So we all start to play soccer, and after I was 10 years\r\nold, I went to a little club in Munich. When I was 13 years old, I moved\r\nto Bayern, Munich, and when I was 18, I was a professional.\"\r\n\r\nFranz smiles at the mention of Manhattan. \"When I signed the contract,\r\nthey asked me where I wanted to stay. In the suburbs? I said no, I want\r\nto stay in the city. A friend of mine knows a businessman who lives\r\nbeside the Central Park. He is most of the year outside the country. The\r\napartment was free, and he let me have it for six months. I was very\r\nlucky. I like to walk around the park to watch the people. I have been to\r\nLincoln Center a few times, and of course different shows on Broadway.\r\nBut I never saw a city like New York. You have so many good\r\nrestaurants. It's unbelievable.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the off-season, Franz does some promotional work for both\r\nMercedes-Benz and Adidas, the sporting goods company that\r\nmanufactures, among other things, a Franz Beckenbauer soccer shoe. As\r\na result, Franz, who will be 33 next month, is not at all worried about his\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\"You know, when I started with soccer as a professional,\" he explains, \"I\r\nhad an aim. I said when I'm finished with soccer, my life will be\r\ndifferent. I can say, 'I want to do this and this,' and not 'I must do this.'\r\nWhen I finish my career, I would like to go through the United States in\r\na mobile with my family, to see all the states. That's for sure.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER HIMAN BROWN\r\nCreator of the _CBS Radio Mystery Theater_\r\n\r\n5-10-80\r\n\r\nDuring the 1930s, a comedy called _The Rise of the Goldbergs_ was\r\nsecond only to _Amos & Andy_ as the most popular radio show in\r\nAmerica. Its success was due largely to the efforts of a young man from\r\nBrooklyn named Himan Brown, who co-produced the series, sold it to\r\nNBC and did the voice of Mr. Goldberg. He had started in radio drama\r\nwhile in his teens, and soon after graduating from Brooklyn Law School\r\nas valedictorian, decided to make radio, not law, his career.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three decades, as producer of _Inner Sanctum Mysteries_,\r\n_The Thin Man_, _Grand Central Station_, _Nero Wolfe_ and other\r\nseries, Brown became the Norman Lear of radio. But by 1959, it was all\r\nover: the last network radio drama was forced off the air by the onslaught\r\nof television. Brown, however, kept up a personal crusade for radio,\r\npounding on the desks of every broadcast executive he could reach.\r\nFourteen years later, in January 1974, his dream was realized, and radio\r\ndrama was reborn with the _CBS Radio Mystery Theater_.\r\n\r\nThe 52-minute show, it turned out, was long overdue. Within weeks, CBS\r\nreceived 200,000 fan letters from listeners. Currently the _Radio Mystery\r\nTheater_ can be heard in New York on Monday through Friday at 7:07\r\np.m. on station WMCA (570 AM). It is heard seven nights a week on\r\napproximately 250 other stations across the country. Brown, the\r\nproducer/director, oversees every phase of the operation, from hiring the\r\nwriters and actors to directing and recording sessions from a control booth\r\nat the CBS studios.\r\n\r\n\"I have never stopped believing,\" he says, \"that the spoken word and the\r\nimagination of the listener are infinitely stronger and more dramatic than\r\nanything television can offer.\" He is a silvery-haired, distinguished\r\nlooking gentleman with a mischievous twinkle in hie eye and an endless\r\ncapacity for humor. Ruddy-complexioned and vigorous, dressed in a gray\r\npinstripe suit and a crimson tie, he approaches his work with an infectious\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nOn a typical weekday, Brown arrives at the sound studio at 9 a.m. with\r\na batch of scripts under his arm, which he hands out to a group of actors\r\nassembled around a table. Many are stars of the stage or screen -- Tammy\r\nGrimes, Julie Harris, Tony Roberts, Fred Gwynn, Bobby Morse, Roberta\r\nMaxwell, Joan Hackett. \"I get the best actors in the world, right here in\r\nNew York,\" he notes with pride. \"They work for me in the daytime and\r\non Broadway at night.\"\r\n\r\nAs the cast members go through a cold reading. Brown interjects his\r\ncomments: \"Do a little more with that. ... Don't swallow your words\r\nthere. ... Cross out that line.\" The actors laugh and joke their way\r\nthrough the session; Brown is the biggest jokester of all. Finally everyone\r\ntakes a break before doing the actual taping. Brown calls his 91-year-old\r\nmother on the telephone and speaks to her in Yiddish for some time. Then\r\nhe answers a questions about his discoveries in sound effects.\r\n\r\n\"In the 1930s I was doing _Dick Tracy_, a very popular show. For sound\r\neffects we had several doors. One of them screaked, no matter what we\r\ndid to it. I like to think that door was talking to us, saying, 'Make me a\r\nstar,'\" he says with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe creaking door later became the signature for _Inner Sanctum\r\nMysteries_, and is now employed as the introductory note for the _Radio\r\nMystery Theater_, along with host E.G. Marshall's compelling greeting:\r\n\"Come _in_.\" Himan Brown also created the sound of London's foghorns\r\nand Big Ben for _Bulldog Drummond_, the laugh of the fat Nero Wolfe,\r\nand the never-to-be-forgotten train that roared under Park Avenue into\r\nGrand Central Station.\r\n\r\nWhen the recording session get underway, Brown observes the performers\r\nthrough the thick glass of the control booth as they stand around a\r\nmicrophone, reading their line with animation. From time to time he stops\r\nthe action and repeats parts of a scene. \"It's all spliced together\r\nafterwards,\" he explains.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1940s, Brown began to produce television dramas, such as\r\n_Lights Out_ and the _Chevy Mystery Show_. He built a large TV studio\r\non West 26th Street for that purpose, which for many years he has leased\r\nto CBS for filming the soap opera _The Guiding Light_.\r\n\r\nFor most of his career, Brown has been a resident of the Upper West\r\nSide. The father of two, he is married to Shirley Goodman, executive vice\r\npresident of the Fashion Institute of Technology. He has long been\r\ninvolved in community affairs and charitable organizations, including the\r\nFederation of Jewish Philanthropies, the National Urban League and the\r\nNational Conference of Social Work. Brown is constantly in demand as\r\na public speaker, a fund-raiser, and a creator of multimedia presentations.\r\n\r\nHis plans for 1980 include reviving the _Adventure Theater_, a children's\r\nradio with that he last did in 1977. \"The best thing about radio drama,\"\r\nhe joyfully concludes, \"is that we can take you anywhere, unhampered by\r\nsets, production costs, locations, makeup, costumes, or memorizing lines,\r\nand make you believe everything we put on the air. ... The screen in your\r\nhead is much bigger than the biggest giant screen ever made. It gives you\r\nan experience no other form of theatre can duplicate. It's the theatre of the\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nFERRIS BUTLER\r\nCreator, writer and producer of _Waste Meat News_\r\n\r\n4-7-79\r\n\r\nEvery Saturday at 11:30 p.m., millions of Americans tune in to what is\r\nindisputably the boldest, the most innovative, and frequently the most\r\ntasteless comedy show on television -- NBC's _Saturday Night Live_. But\r\nfor the 400,000 residents of Manhattan who have cable TV, there is\r\nanother program -- also aired at 11:30, but on Sunday evening -- that is,\r\nin its own way, even more offbeat.\r\n\r\nKnown as _Waste Meat News_, the half-hour satiric revue has been a\r\nregular feature of Channel D since April, 1976, when a young Westsider\r\nnamed Ferris Butler decided that he had the talent to write, direct, and\r\nproduce his own comedy series, even without money and film equipment.\r\nTime has proven him right: last year, _TV World_ magazine discovered,\r\nin a poll of viewers, that _Waste Meat News_ is the most popular comedy\r\nprogram on cable, out of 150 public access shows.\r\n\r\nA tall, willowy, 27-year-old with a quizzical expression permanently fixed\r\non his face, Ferris once worked as a part-time office boy at Channel 7's\r\n_Eyewitness News_, and there he came to the conclusion that \"TV news\r\nis nothing but throwaway scraps, like sausages or hot dogs. ... Very little\r\nprotein, like waste meat.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the skits he conceives have the same format as \"straight\" news\r\nitems, but have been twisted by his imagination into something\r\noutrageous. In place of the standard weather reports, for example, there\r\nis Ferris' \"Leather Weather Girl,\" in which a girl is tied to a table, her\r\nbody representing a map of the world.\r\n\r\nThe weather reporter, while telling about an impending onslaught of rain\r\nand snow, dramatizes his points by pouring a pitcher of water over the\r\ngirl, smothering her with shaving cream, and finally applying a blow\r\ndryer to evaporate the messes while explaining that a warm air front will\r\nfollow. Other skits include \"Swedish Grease,\" \"Music to Eat Rice By,\"\r\nand \"The Adversaries,\" in which two actors wearing grotesque masks\r\ndebate the question: should monsters be allowed to kill people, or just\r\nfrighten them?\r\n\r\nIdeas for skits, says Ferris, come to him any time of night or day, now\r\nthat he has \"stopped working at any legitimate job. I watch a lot of\r\ntelevision. But most of the time, I meander around the streets and just\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n\"I remember when I got the idea for the foreign language cursing\r\ndetector. I was sitting on a bench in the park, smoking grass, when some\r\nforeign tourists came and sat down, and started talking about me in\r\nGerman like I was a bum. And I thought, why not have a portable siren\r\nthat goes off whenever a swear word is spoken in any language?\"\r\n\r\nHe describes himself as \"a very unregimented person who can't jive with\r\nthe mainstream industry.\" This accounts for much of the spontaneity in\r\n_Waste Meat News_. The performers sometimes don't see the scripts until\r\nthe taping session. Each segment requires several run-throughs before it\r\nis smooth enough to be filmed. Frequently the filming goes on far into the\r\nnight. Although the show is done with a single camera and half-inch\r\nvideotape, the final result makes up in charm what it lacks in professional\r\ngloss.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I'm a little rough in the way I produce it,\" says Ferris, \"but I'm\r\nbeing a pioneer and I'm not worried about perfection as long as the\r\naudience has a positive reaction.\"\r\n\r\nHis cast is an irregular group of about 15 unpaid actors and actresses,\r\nmost of them young. Two current stars of _Waste Meat News_ are Pat\r\nProfito, a master of comedy who injects an infectious vitality into all of\r\nhis performances, and Laura Suarez, a Strassberg-trained actress and\r\nformer Playboy Bunny who frequently portrays the naive sexpot who\r\ncrops up in many of Ferris' sketches.\r\n\r\nMost of the filming is done on the Upper West Side -- usually on the\r\nstreet or in someone's apartment, but also in such diverse places as stores,\r\nrestaurants, the waterfront, boiler rooms and lobbies. A recent skit was\r\nshot at a Westside swimming pool; it features Pat Profito as a swimming\r\ninstructor who teaches three bikini-clad beauties his \"jump-in-and-swim\"\r\nmethod, in which he pushes them into the pool and expects them to swim\r\ninstinctively, or drown.\r\n\r\nFerris, who grew up in Queens and Brooklyn \"and departed as soon as\r\nwas possible,\" studied filmmaking at New York University under Martin\r\nScorsese and was encouraged to pursue comedy writing. For the past five\r\nyears he has been married to Beverly Ross, a composer with many hits to\r\nher credit including \"Lollipop.\"\r\n\r\nIt's 10 seconds before midnight on Sunday evening. Time once again for\r\nFerris to bid his viewers goodnight. \"And remember: stay alienated, stay\r\nwiped out, and stay wasted.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER SAMMY CAHN\r\nOscar-winning lyricist\r\n\r\n3-10-79\r\n\r\n\"I've never written a song that didn't almost write itself,\" says Sammy\r\nCahn, one of the world's most successful lyricists of popular songs. \"I'm\r\nlike the catalyst. It's like I start the boulder down the hill, but after that,\r\nthere's only one place it can go. I'm always thrilled by the adventure of\r\nfinding the lyric and leading it to a happy conclusion. If I come to the\r\nslightest impasse, I've learned to stop, and look around and see what\r\nneeds to be done around the house. Then I come back, and it's so easy.\r\nYou can't go into combat with a lyric.\"\r\n\r\nOver the past four decades, his songs have received four Oscars and more\r\nthan 30 Oscar nominations. Among his numerous hits, written in\r\ncollaboration with six different melodists, are \"Three Coins in a\r\nFountain,\" \"Love and Marriage,\" \"Call Me Irresponsible\" and \"Let It\r\nSnow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!\" His musicals include _Anchors\r\nAweigh_ and _High Button Shoes_. As a performer, he has the distinction\r\nof making his Broadway debut in 1974 at the age of 60, in a one-man\r\nshow with backup musicians titled _Words and Music_, in which he sang\r\nhis own material and told colorful stories about his life and career. For his\r\nperformance, Sammy won the Outer Circle Critic's Award for Best New\r\nTalent on Broadway, as well as a Theatre World Award. Since then, he\r\nhas been in great demand all over the country as an entertainer.\r\n\r\nSmall, wiry and energetic -- he describes himself as \"all glasses and\r\nmustache\" -- he is utterly without pretension, and seems as much at home\r\nwith strangers on the street as he is with royalty (last year he sang for\r\nEngland's Prince Charles). He manages to embrace both worlds by\r\ninvolving himself in many projects simultaneously.\r\n\r\nBorn on \"the lowest part of the Lower East Side,\" he now has an\r\napartment in the East 60s with his wife Tita, a fashion designer. He has\r\nanother residence in Los Angeles, and spends about the same number of\r\ndays each year in the two homes.\r\n\r\nRecently Sammy completed the songs for a new cartoon film of _Heidi_\r\nand a series of songs for _Sesame Street_. He also works as a consultant\r\nfor Faberge, and has a large office in the company's East Side\r\nheadquarters. As president of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Sammy\r\ndevotes much of his time to publicizing the non-profit organization's\r\nmuseum on the eighth floor of One Times Square. It is open Monday\r\nthrough Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and admission is free. He\r\nrecently met with the producer of the Broadway musical _Annie_ to\r\ndiscuss writing a new musical. He gives generously to many charitable\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nBut the majority of his time these days goes to writing and performing\r\nspecial lyrics for special occasions -- usually parodies of his own hit\r\nsongs. Sometimes he does this for profit, and sometimes for love. He was\r\npaid handsomely to prepare a birthday celebration for Ray Kroc, the head\r\nof Mcdonald's. But a couple of weeks ago, when a man wrote to Sammy\r\ntelling him how much his songs had meant to him and his wife over the\r\nyears, and asking him to please write some personalized lyrics for their\r\n18th wedding anniversary, Sammy was \"just enough of an idiot to sit\r\ndown and do it.\"\r\n\r\nHe works exclusively at the typewriter. \"I have become almost audacious.\r\nWhen I put a piece of paper in the typewriter, I know that the completed\r\nsong will be on that page. I'm very grateful to the man who invented\r\nCorrectotype and liquid paper. I start to type as soon as I get up, and I\r\nthink about songs all day long. When I sleep at night, I sleep with an\r\nearplug in my ear, tuned to WCBS or WINS radio. They're both news\r\nstations. The radio distracts me: it stops me from thinking about lyrics.\"\r\n\r\nAs we are talking, Sammy keeps remembering telephone calls he needs\r\nto make, but he keeps them brief and to the point. As soon as he hangs\r\nup, our conversation jumps immediately back to the previous subject, as\r\nif there had been no interruption. He is extremely quick-minded -- to the\r\nextent that his thoughts sometimes race ahead of him, and his sentences\r\nlose their structure. In speaking of his son, a very successful jazz guitarist\r\nwho performs under the name Steve Khan, Sammy comments: \"Now, my\r\nson -- brace yourself -- my son -- this is one of my great, great\r\nachievements -- my fame is coming from a very curious source. People\r\ncome up to me and say, 'You're Steve Kahn's father?'\"\r\n\r\nAsked about the satisfaction he has gotten from songwriting, Sammy\r\ninsists that he can't imagine a more rewarding career. \"I once told that to\r\na college audience and a boy said, 'I'm studying to be a lawyer. What's\r\nwrong with that?' I said, 'Nothing, but who walks down the street\r\nhumming a lawsuit?'\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER HUGH CAREY\r\nGovernor of New York state\r\n\r\n9-16-78\r\n\r\nIt was 5 p.m. on the Friday before Labor Day. Governor Hugh Carey sat\r\nalone in his office on West 55th Street, rubbing his forehead wearily with\r\nboth hands when his assistant press secretary, Judy Deich, ushered me in.\r\nThe introductions were brief, and the governor spoke very rapidly,\r\nkeeping is eyes on the table in front of him, where he was scrawling\r\npencil lines in geometric patterns on a piece of blank paper, as if to\r\nmaintain his concentration.\r\n\r\nThe Governor had been up for 12 hours, and his voice occasionally faded\r\nto a whisper, but he answered all the questions with a flair and displayed\r\na sincere manner throughout. Sitting kitty-corner to me at a conference\r\ntable, he looked smaller and thinner than his photographs. He also looked\r\nlike one of the tiredest, most overworked men I had ever met.\r\n\r\n\"I have been staying on the West Side a lot since last September,\" he said.\r\n\"That's when my sons Donald and Michael got an apartment near Central\r\nPark. They're kind enough to put me up there. We have the usual tenants'\r\ncomplaints about the leaky ceilings and peeling paint. All in all, it's a\r\ngood building. I find more and more advantages to living on the West\r\nSide. I like it because of the accessibility to work and because I jog in\r\nCentral Park.\r\n\r\n\"One of my headaches is Central Park. Some of my colleagues would like\r\nto make it a national park. It's the city's biggest showplace. ... I want to\r\nget the automobiles out of there more and more. In the morning, I see all\r\nthe New Jersey cars coming through. That's why I want Westway below\r\n42d Street -- so it will take more pressure off the city. ... I wish everyone\r\nwould realize that Westway is not a road. It's a recessed highway -- more\r\nof a tunnel.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking frankly of the problem of ex-mental patients in parts of the West\r\nSide, Carey said that \"we have indexed all the SRO's. That was never\r\ndone before. ... The homeless people who live on the street are not the\r\nwards of the state. We can't just go out and pick them up. ... If they need\r\nsome kind of health care, they should be taken to a shelter and given\r\nhealth care. If they resist, we will have peace officers to take care of\r\nthem. That's something I'm doing with Mayor Koch.\"\r\n\r\nEver since he defeated Nelson Rockefeller's appointed successor, Malcolm\r\nWilson, in 1974, Hugh Carey has become well known for both his\r\nconservative moral code and his unswerving fiscal restraint. Born on April\r\n11, 1919, to an Irish Catholic family in Brooklyn, Carey grew up with\r\nfive brothers believing in certain principles that he has never abandoned.\r\nThese moral principles have become the foundation of his controversial\r\nstands on the death penalty and abortion.\r\n\r\n\"I am against the death penalty,\" said Carey, \"because the government can\r\nmake a mistake. A sentence of life without parole is better. There are six\r\npeople now walking around the state who were condemned to death and\r\nlater proven innocent. One is named Zimmy and he works on the West\r\nSide in a garment factory. Somebody should ask him what he thinks about\r\nthe death penalty. He's alive because somebody confessed.\r\n\r\n\"I oppose abortion personally. But the Supreme Court upheld that it's the\r\nchoice of a woman of her own free will, and I support that ruling. In New\r\nYork, the state pays for it if it's a matter of medical necessity. Otherwise,\r\nthere might be a mangled body in a back alley. ... I'm also advocating an\r\nalternative -- a teenage pregnancy bill, where girls can have a baby\r\nwithout shame and go back to school. It's the most common reason for\r\ndropouts among teenagers.\"\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Hugh Carey fought in France, Belgium, Holland\r\nand Germany, and attained the rank of major. After the service, he\r\nworked for many years as an executive in his brother Edward's Peerless\r\nOil and Chemical Corporation. Not until 1960, when he was 41 years old,\r\ndid Carey decide to run for political office. He won his first congressional\r\nrace and during the 1960s developed a national reputation for his liberal\r\nattitude on education, and programs for the elderly and handicapped.\r\n\r\nHis life has twice been touched by deep personal tragedy in recent years.\r\nAn automobile accident in 1969 took the lives of his two eldest sons, and\r\ncancer claimed his wife Helen in 1974. A man who loves the company of\r\nother people, Carey enjoys such simple pleasures as cooking with friends\r\nand singing with his children.\r\n\r\nAsked about the chief difference between himself and Republican\r\nchallenger Perry Duryea, the governor replied with obvious glee: \"I can't\r\nthink of anything we have in common. ... I'll knock the Y right out of his\r\nname before I'm finished.\"\r\n\r\nGenerally known to be at his best in times of crisis, Carey said that\r\nwhenever the pressures of his office become too great for him to handle\r\nalone, he drops into the chapel and asks for help. \"It's a matter of privacy\r\nto me; I go where I'm not seen,\" he said. \"I need help quite a lot. Also,\r\nI believe that New York is a very special place, with a resourcefulness\r\nthat can't be matched anywhere in the world. When people have come\r\ntogether as New Yorkers, they have done amazing things.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER CRAIG CLAIBORNE\r\nFood editor of the _New York Times_\r\n\r\n3-10-79\r\n\r\n\"To be a good restaurant critic, you shouldn't have a conscience,\" says\r\nCraig Claiborne, food editor of the _New York Times_. \"I used to visit\r\nrestaurants twice a day, frequently seven days a week, and lie awake\r\nbrooding about whether my reviews were honest -- whether I was hurting\r\nsomebody who didn't deserve to be hurt.\"\r\n\r\nRecognized throughout the United States as the father of modern\r\nrestaurant criticism, Claiborne joined the _Times_ in 1957, and shortly\r\nthereafter was given the go-ahead to write reviews based on a four-star\r\nsystem. \"The _New York Times_ made the decision. I was the\r\ninstrument. It was the first newspaper that allowed a restaurant critic to\r\nsay anything he wanted. It took a lot of guts, when a newspaper depends\r\non advertising.\"\r\n\r\nA 58-year-old bachelor whose soft voice still carries strong traces of his\r\nnative Mississippi, Claiborne has few of the characteristics generally\r\nimagined of a Timesman. He is a true bon vivant, and does not appear to\r\ntake himself or his work too seriously. He prefers to be called by his first\r\nname, is not a particularly fashionable dresser, and spends as little time\r\nas possible in Manhattan. In his lighter moods, such as that in which I\r\nfind him on the day of our interview, he delights in telling jokes that are\r\nclassics of schoolyard humor. The punch line, more often than not, is\r\ndrowned by his own uproarious laughter.\r\n\r\nAlthough he has maintained a Westside apartment for the past nine years,\r\nClaiborne spends most of his time at his house in East Hampton, Long\r\nIsland, next door to Pierre Franey, one of the greatest French chefs in\r\nAmerica, who, since 1974, has co-authored Claiborne's food articles for\r\nthe _New York Times_ Sunday magazine. Recently he purchased a larger,\r\nmore modern house about 15 minutes from Franey, which he plans to\r\noccupy shortly. The pair cook together about five times a week. Claiborne\r\ncalls the house \"my Taj Mahal -- my Xanadu.\"\r\n\r\nHe explains his jovial mood by saying that the night before, he attended\r\na big dinner party for restaurateur Joe Baum at the Four Seasons. \"It was\r\nan everybody-bring-something dinner. Jim Beard brought bread. I brought\r\nsaviche (marinated raw fish), and Gael Greene brought some chocolate\r\ndessert. I got roaring drunk.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his earthiness, Claiborne unquestionably ranks as one of the\r\nleading food authorities of his time. His articles, which appear in the\r\n_Times_ each Monday, Wednesday and Sunday, cover every subject from\r\nthe particulars of a dinner for Chinese Vice-Premier Teng Hsiao-ping in\r\nWashington (where Claiborne saw a rock group he had never heard of\r\ncalled the Osmonds) to the six most creative ways of preparing scallops.\r\nHe has written numerous best-selling cookbooks, and he often travels\r\naround the world on fact-finding missions.\r\n\r\nClaiborne's rise from obscurity to the most prestigious food job in\r\nAmerica astonished no one more than himself, since his principal\r\nqualifications were a B.A. in journalism and one year's training at a hotel\r\nand restaurant school in Switzerland. However, the _Times_ knew exactly\r\nwhat they were looking for when Jane Nickerson retired in 1957, and\r\nClaiborne quickly proved to be the man of the hour. He threw himself\r\ninto his work with boundless energy, writing no less than five columns a\r\nweek, but his relationship with the newspaper eventually became a love\r\nhate affair. \"Things came to the point where I couldn't go to a restaurant\r\nat night unless I came home here and had at least four Scotch and sodas\r\nand four martinis. And at this point, I took myself off to Africa. I stayed\r\nat the Stanley Hotel in Kenya, and I came back and said, 'Give me my\r\nbenefits. I'm quitting this place.' They thought I was kidding.\"\r\n\r\nHe wasn't. Claiborne left the paper for almost two years. \"Then the\r\n_Times_ came to me and said, 'Would you come back under any\r\ncircumstances?' And I must confess that I felt a great emotional relief.\"\r\nHe agreed to return if the paper would have someone else do the local\r\nrestaurant reviews; he also requested that his neighbor and cooking partner\r\nPierre Franey share the Sunday byline. The conditions were immediately\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nClaiborne's Westside apartment is painted green from floor to ceiling --\r\nthus fulfilling an old fantasy of his. He describes the apartment itself as\r\n\"gently shabby,\" but says that the building, constructed in 1883, is \"the\r\ngreatest residency in the entire island of Manhattan. You're catty-corner\r\nfrom Carnegie Hall, you're six minutes by foot from Lincoln Center, you\r\ncan walk to any place on Broadway within seconds, and there are very\r\nfew restaurants you couldn't get to within five minutes of this place.\" His\r\nfavorite restaurant in all of Manhattan is the Shun Lee Palace (155 E. 55th\r\nSt.), while two other favorites on the West Side are the Russian Tea\r\nRoom and the Fuji Restaurant (238 W. 56th).\r\n\r\nAsked about other interests or hobbies, Claiborne smiles mischievously\r\nand replies: \"I'm having a $6000 Bolton stereo system put into my new\r\nXanadu. You can clap your hands and change the tapes or records. I love\r\nmusic and sex and food, and outside of that, forget it!\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MARC CONNELLY\r\nActor, director, producer, novelist, and Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist\r\n\r\n1-7-78\r\n\r\nEleven years ago, during my senior year in high school, I saw a movie\r\njust before Christmas that made a deep impression. It was a film of a\r\nstage play called _The Green Pastures_ -- a fascinating look at life in\r\nbiblical times, performed by an all-black cast.\r\n\r\nThe memory of that film remained in my consciousness like a religious\r\nexperience, although I never knew who wrote the play or when it was\r\nwritten. So it was a welcome surprise to learn that this week's interview\r\nwould be with the play's author, Marc Connelly.\r\n\r\nConnelly was born in a small Pennsylvania town in 1890, the son of a pair\r\nof travelling actors. He wrote _The Green Pastures_ in 1930; it won that\r\nyear's Pulitzer Prize for drama. In his 70-year career Connelly has written\r\ndozens of plays. One of the most versatile talents in the American theatre,\r\nhe has excelled as an actor, director, producer, playwriting professor at\r\nYale, and popular lecturer. He has written musicals, stage plays, movie\r\nscripts and radio plays.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the original staff members of the _New Yorker_ magazine,\r\nand became part of the famous round table at the Algonquin Hotel. One\r\nof his short stories won an O. Henry award. His first novel was published\r\nwhen he was 74 years old. Today, still an active playwright, he lives\r\npeacefully at Central Park West, comfortable in his role as an elder\r\nstatesman of American letters.\r\n\r\nI feel a certain freedom about repeating the comments Connelly made\r\nduring our interview because the first thing he said at the door was \"I\r\nnever read anything about myself. ... It's not modesty; it's more terror --\r\nfor fear that some dark secret will emerge.\"\r\n\r\nYes, he said, he's very busy these days. \"I've just completed a comedy\r\nwhich I'm waiting to have done. I'd rather not mention the title before it\r\ncomes out. It's a comic fantasy.\"\r\n\r\nHe recently taped an appearance on the _Dick Cavett Show_, which will\r\nbe aired sometime this month. And he's working on a musical version of\r\n_Farmer Takes A Wife_, a Broadway play that he co-authored in 1934.\r\nIt became a successful film the next year, with Henry Fonda's screen\r\npremiere.\r\n\r\n\"They're always reviving my plays. Last summer they did _Merton of the\r\nMovies_ (which he wrote with George F. Kaufman in 1922) in that big\r\ntheatre complex in Los Angeles. It was quite successful. The boy that\r\nplays John-Boy on the Waltons played Merton. It was quite good; I went\r\nto see it.\"\r\n\r\nMuch as Connelly dislikes certain TV shows, he thinks very highly of TV\r\nas a medium: \"It's good, it's good. I like three or four shows. _Mash_ is\r\nwonderful. I like _Maude_ every now and then. And Carol Burnett. I\r\nmight like _Kojak_ if it didn't run every five minutes. Three times a night\r\nis too much for any TV show.\"\r\n\r\nAny anecdotes about the \"Vicious Circle\" of the Algonquin Hotel -- whose\r\nmembers included Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Edna Ferber,\r\nAlexander Woollcott and George Kaufman? \"Oh, I don't want to talk\r\nabout the round table,\" he said. \"Every time you turn around there's a\r\nnew book about the round table. ... I've written about George Kaufman\r\nand so have a hundred other people. It might be that he might get out of\r\nhis grave and club us all for writing about him.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough _The Green Pastures_ is considered an American classic, it is\r\nnow performed only by school and amateur companies. Its depiction of\r\nplantation life has become offensive to socially conscious blacks. \"There\r\nare Negro snobs,\" explained Connelly, \"just like there are Irish snobs and\r\nJewish snobs. As soon as people get in a position of economic power,\r\nthey become sensitive about the way they are shown on the stage. It's a\r\nvery human, inevitable reaction.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, he thinks that his masterwork is as valid today as ever. \"It's a\r\nstatement about the fact that man has been hunting the divine in himself\r\never since he became a conscious animal. And this is the story of one\r\naspect of his search for the divine in himself.\"\r\n\r\nConnelly attends Broadway \"when there's something I feel I want to see.\r\nI walk out on quite a few. Theatre is just as strong today. A seasonal crop\r\nmay be poor, but theatre itself is healthy. It's probably the greatest social\r\ninstrument man ever invented. All religions have sprung from the\r\ntheatre.\"\r\n\r\nA Westsider since about 1920, Marc Connelly named Schwartz's Candy\r\nStore on West 72nd as one of his favorite neighborhood businesses. \"It's\r\none of the finest candy shops in New York,\" he said. \"You can see my\r\nportrait there. And the A&P at 68th and Broadway. There's a checkout\r\ngirl there named Noreen who's one of the best checkout girls in\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview came to an end when I again asked Connelly about\r\ntelevision. Does he approve of it? \"Of course,\" he said. \"Any new public\r\naddition is going to be condemned. They used to say, 'Don't go to the\r\nmovies. ... You'll go blind.' We're not blind and we still watch them.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER TONY CRAIG\r\nStar of _The Edge of Night_\r\n\r\n1-26-79\r\n\r\nAlthough Los Angeles has long since taken over prime-time TV\r\nprogramming, New York is still the headquarters for daytime drama --\r\nalso known as soap opera. Of the 13 \"soaps,\" 10 are filmed in New York,\r\nand of these 10, five have been on the small screen since the 1950s,\r\nincluding _The Edge of Night_, which debuted in 1956.\r\n\r\nThe show's crime/mystery format has not changed much over the years,\r\nbut one thing that has changed, of course, is the cast of characters. Tony\r\nCraig, who plays attorney Draper Scott, joined the show in November,\r\n1975, and since then he has become one of the most popular male stars\r\nin daytime television.\r\n\r\nTony owes his success not only to his good looks and his acting ability,\r\nbut also to his likable off-camera personality. Upon meeting Tony on the\r\nset of _The Edge of Night_ during a busy shooting session, I cannot help\r\nnoticing the affection that the other cast members display toward him. His\r\nability to get along with everyone involved with the show -- especially\r\nproducer Nick Nicholson, and headwriter Henry Slesar -- has enabled\r\nTony to develop the role of Draper Scott into one of the four leading\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\"I was given a piece of advice when I started,\" says Tony. \"One: keep to\r\nyour business and do what you're told, and two, answer your fan mail. I\r\nanswer all my fan mail with a very personal response. ... In the _National\r\nStar_, I once said I was looking for Miss Right, and I got inundated with\r\nletters. Some people sent plane ticket, asking me to come and see them.\"\r\n\r\nAs we sit down to talk in one of the dressing rooms, Tony puts on a tie\r\nand jacket for an upcoming bar scene, but because only his top half will\r\nbe shown on camera, he does not bother to change out of his blue jeans\r\nand running shoes. Tall, athletically built and boyish in appearance, he\r\ndiscusses his work with an infectious enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"The closer I get to the character, the more I see that he and I are very\r\nmuch alike,\" says Tony in his rapid speech. \"It's funny, the way I've\r\nassimilated him and he's assimilated me. It's like the dummy in _Magic_.\r\nThe character has gone from a very impetuous, aggressive, almost nasty\r\nyoung man to a very quiet, strong, very reserved lawyer. It's changed to\r\nthe point where I'm a pillar of the community. Whenever there's a\r\nproblem, call Draper.\r\n\r\n\"I think I allow Tony a little more anger, a little more frustration, than\r\nDraper allows himself. ... I'm very normal, I'm very average, I'm very\r\naggressive. Some people would say pushy. But I do what I have to.\"\r\n\r\nApproximately 260 half-hour shows are filmed each year for _The Edge\r\nof Night_, and Tony appears in most of them. He starts his day by\r\nstudying lines -- \"we have about a week ahead to go over the script\" --\r\nand then goes to the studio on East 44th Street, where each scene gets just\r\none run-through before the final taping. A quick learner, Tony finds that\r\n\"I have plenty of time to do what I want.\" Last year he launched a\r\nsuccessful musical nightclub act and performed in two stage plays by Neil\r\nSimon -- _Barefoot in the Park_ with Maureen O'Sullivan and _The Star\r\nSpangled Girl_.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of Tony's life is sports. When growing up in\r\nPittsburgh, he says, \"all I ever wanted was to be an athlete. My whole life\r\nwas baseball. But I just wasn't good enough.\" Now he works out three\r\ntimes a week at the 21st Century Health Club on East 57th Street, jogs,\r\nplays tennis and racquetball, and is on the softball and basketball teams of\r\nboth _The Edge of Night_ and the _ABC Eyewitness News_. Says Tony:\r\n\"The _Eyewitness News_ team plays all over the tri-state area and gives\r\nthe proceeds to charity.\"\r\n\r\nUnlike his TV character, who recently brought up the ratings by marrying\r\nthe beautiful April Cavanaugh (played by Terry Davis), Tony lives alone\r\nin an Upper East Side apartment. \"How can I put this without sounding\r\nfull of beans and self-pity?\" He remarks. \"I find that life is a lot more\r\nexciting when you share it with somebody. ... The girl I'm dating now is\r\na news reporter in Baltimore, Jeanne Downey. Long distance isn't the\r\nnext best thing to being there, believe me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Tony won the part of Draper Scott over 200 other actors, he was\r\nworking part-time as a bartender at Joe Allen's in the theatre district. \"I\r\nwas doing commercials and a lot of modeling -- nothing significant.\r\nBefore this show, I'd never made more than $1,200 a year from acting.\r\nI didn't expect to get the part, because they wanted someone in his mid\r\n40s. They rewrote the script for a younger attorney. My agent signed me\r\nup on a lark. That just goes to show: when it happens, it happens.\"\r\n\r\nTony hates to cook -- which is fine with the restaurateurs in his area. His\r\nfavorite dining spot is La Bonne Soupe (3rd Ave., 57th-58th St.): they\r\nhave the prettiest waitresses and most pleasant food.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about the lasting value of soap opera, he quickly replies: \"I believe\r\ntelevision has an obligation to do nothing but entertain. Everything on\r\ntelevision, even news, is show business. If it weren't, they wouldn't have\r\nratings and handsome newsmen.\"\r\n\r\nAnyone wishing to hear from Tony should write to him at ABC, 1330\r\nAvenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10019.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER RODNEY DANGERFIELD\r\nThe comedian and the man\r\n\r\n1-6-79\r\n\r\nHe was 43 years old when the big break came. Jack Roy, a paint salesman\r\nfrom Queens who did comedy in his spare time, stood before the cameras\r\nof the _Ed Sullivan Show_ and delivered a routine that soon had the\r\naudience helpless with laughter. Whether they realized they were\r\nwitnessing the birth of one of comedy's brightest stars is uncertain. But\r\nfor Jack Roy -- better known as Rodney Dangerfield -- the long wait was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nHis unique brand of humor caught on immediately. Within a year he was\r\nable to quit the paint business -- \"it was a colorless job\" -- and give his\r\nfull time to comedy. After 10 appearances with Sullivan he went on _The\r\nTonight Show_, and established such a smooth rapport with Johnny\r\nCarson that he has so far been invited back about 60 times. With Carson\r\nacting as \"straight man,\" Dangerfield tosses off a string of outrageous\r\nanecdotes that are in keeping with his image as a man who seems to have\r\nthe whole world against him.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon I meet Rodney Dangerfield at his spacious modern East\r\nSide apartment is like a day straight out of his monologue. Coming to the\r\ndoor dressed in a polka dot robe and looking quite exhausted, he\r\napologizes by saying that he has been up since 8 in the morning -- early\r\nfor someone who is accustomed to working past 4 a.m. As we sit down\r\nto talk, he answers most of my questions with an unexpected seriousness.\r\nStill, the humor creeps in around the edges.\r\n\r\n\"I have an image to feed. Most comedians don't,\" he says with a yawn,\r\nsprawled out on the sofa like a bear prematurely woken from hibernation.\r\n\"If I see something or read something that starts me thinking, I try to turn\r\nit around, and ask myself: How can it go wrong for me now? What can\r\nhappen here? For example, you're watching something on television. You\r\nsee Lindbergh on the screen. Your mind is on that TV. ... You get no\r\nrespect at all. You see the paper flying all over the place. You say, I get\r\nno respect at all. I got arrested for littering at a ticker tape parade.\r\n\r\n\"Rickles has an image. Steve Martin has an image. But most don't. A lot\r\nof comedians buy their material. Others take someone else's material and\r\nsteal it. We don't go into that, though.\"\r\n\r\nBeing a professional funny man, says Rodney, \"is a completely total\r\nsacrifice. It's like dope: you have to do it. ... The curse is to be a\r\nperfectionist.\"\r\n\r\nHe writes at least 90 percent of his act. Whenever an original joke flashes\r\ninto his mind, he drops whatever he's doing and jots it down. (\"I get no\r\nrespect. On my wedding night I got arrested for having a girl in my\r\nroom.\") Before a new gag can be thought worthy of _The Tonight Show_,\r\nit must be tested and retested before a live audience. This is no problem,\r\nfor Rodney is constantly in demand all over the North American\r\ncontinent, not only as a nightclub performer but also as a lecturer at\r\ncolleges. Last June he was invited to give the commencement address at\r\nHarvard. \"It's a strange thing,\" he remarks. \"Kids are into me.\"\r\n\r\nOne probable reason for his appeal with the young is that Rodney has two\r\nchildren of his own, an 18-year-old son in college and a 14-year-old\r\ndaughter who lives at home. It was mainly to lighten his travel schedule\r\nand enable him to spend more time with his children that Rodney opened\r\nhis own nightclub nine years ago. Known simply as Dangerfield's, it is\r\nlocated on First Avenue between 61st and 62nd Streets. Dangerfield's is\r\nespecially popular with out-of-town visitors. Among the celebrities who\r\nhave been spotted there: Bob Hope, Johnny Carson, Joe Namath, Telly\r\nSavalas and Led Zeppelin. The entertainment usually consists of both\r\nmusic and comedy -- Jackie Mason, singers Gene Barry and Carmen\r\nMacRae, and America's foremost political impressionist, David Frye.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest attraction, of course, is Rodney himself. He will be\r\nplaying the club from January 5 until February 4, seven nights a week.\r\nThere is an $8 cover charge and a $7 minimum on food and/or drink.\r\n\r\nRodney has lived on the East Side since 1969. Born as Jacob Cohen 57\r\nyears ago in Babylon, Long Island, he spent most of his boyhood and his\r\nearly career in Queens. After graduating from Richmond Hill High\r\nSchool, he changed his legal name to Jack Roy \"because my father used\r\n'Roy' in vaudeville.\" For years he worked small nightclubs for little or no\r\npay. Then at 28 he married. \"My wife was a singer. So we decided to\r\nboth quit show business and lead a normal life. That doesn't always work\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThe first \"no respect\" joke he ever wrote, says Rodney, was: \"I played\r\nhide and seek. They wouldn't even look for me.\" The same basic gag has\r\nsince reappeared in a thousand variations. (\"My twin brother forgot my\r\nbirthday.\")\r\n\r\nRodney now earns a substantial part of his income by making\r\ncommercials, the best known of which are for Mobil and Miller Lite beer.\r\nHe has cut two comedy albums and written a pair of books, _I Don't Get\r\nNo Respect_ and _I Couldn't Stand My Wife's Cooking So I Opened a\r\nRestaurant._\r\n\r\nFor the moment, Rodney has no plans for other books or albums.\r\n\"Perhaps I'm not ambitious enough to pursue different things the way I\r\nshould,\" he confesses.\"I'd rather spend my free time at the health club.\r\nThe idea in life is not to see how much money you can die with.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright 2004 The Associated Pr\r\ness.\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JAN DE RUTH\r\nPartner of nudes and _Time_ covers\r\n\r\n9-24-77\r\n\r\nIn 1955, when Jan De Ruth's painting reached the point where he could\r\nsupport himself entirely by his brush and palette, he used to take singing\r\nlessons at 8 o'clock in the morning to make himself get up early. Today\r\nhe gets up strictly to paint, and does so with such skill and efficiency that\r\nhe maintains a reputation as one of America's foremost painters of nudes,\r\nwhile still managing to turn out five or six commissioned portraits a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nAt 55 and in the zenith of his career, De Ruth is a mellow, dignified\r\nWestsider whose lively eyes reflect the deep intellect within. His\r\nachievements in the past two decades are enormous. His works have\r\ngraced nearly 70 one-man shows. His portraits of former First Lady Pat\r\nNixon and other celebrity wives have appeared on the cover of _Time_\r\nmagazine. He has written two widely popular books -- _Portrait Painting_\r\nand _Painting the Nude_. As we relax in the workroom of his West 67th\r\nStreet apartment, I begin by asking how he came to specialize in nudes.\r\n\r\n\"I always knew I would paint women,\" he says in a soft voice shaded with\r\ntones of his native Czechoslovakia. \"In 1948, when I came to the United\r\nStates, I started to paint nudes.\"\r\n\r\nIs his choice of subject matter motivated by something other than art's\r\nsake?\" \"The only person I think who may have these thoughts in mind is\r\nmyself,\" he answers, smiling frankly, \"because I always ask myself\r\nwhether these reasons are purely artistic or do they come from the gut?\r\nI don't think there can be art unless it comes from the gut.\"\r\n\r\nDe Ruth's painting used to occupy him eight to 15 hours a day. Now he\r\nis down to about seven hours. He works very rapidly, with intense\r\nconcentration. \"I don't paint after the afternoon,\" he explains, \"except\r\nsometimes sketching at night. You exhaust your juices by the time evening\r\ncomes along.\"\r\n\r\nOne person he used to sketch after hours was actress Karen Black, who\r\nlived in West 68th Street just across from his apartment. Says De Ruth:\r\n\"she would sit in the in the windowsill in her bra and slip. Then one day\r\nI called over to her, 'Would you like to get paid for this?' She rushed\r\ninside to get her glasses, and looked over at me, very surprised. She\r\nbecame my model for some time.\"\r\n\r\nFor a woman to be an ideal nude model, said De Ruth, \"she should be\r\ngentle, as intelligent as possible, considerate, and somebody in the arts,\r\nor with the sensitivity of an artist. And she must be physically attractive.\"\r\n\r\nHow do the women who pose fully dressed for commissioned portraits\r\ncompare to the professional nude models? \"They work better than my\r\nmodels usually,\" says the artist, who has painted Ethel Kennedy, Eleanor\r\nMcGovern, and the late Martha Mitchell for _Time_. \"They're much\r\nmore concerned to participate. I don't think it's necessarily something to\r\ndo with vanity. It's much more curiosity. Because we never really know\r\nuntil the day we die what we look like. Because we vary so much from\r\none time to another.\"\r\n\r\nIronically, Martha Mitchell -- wife of President Nixon's infamous attorney\r\ngeneral, John Mitchell -- posed for De Ruth inside the Watergate Building\r\nduring the height of her fame. \"She had a certain peasant charm -- a\r\ncharm of her own,\" he recalls.\r\n\r\nA man who craves variety, De Ruth has for many years spent his\r\nsummers at a studio in Massachusetts. This past summer he began to teach\r\npainting in New Mexico -- something he has wanted to try for a long\r\ntime. A passionate skier, he travels to Austria each winter to pursue the\r\nsport that he learned as a child, then gave up until his mid-40s.\r\n\r\nHis other after-work activities? \"I love to be in the company of women,\"\r\nsays the artist with a radiant smile, adding that he prefers their company\r\nwhen he's not painting them.\r\n\r\nThe East Side, according to the artist, is \"a city in itself. There's a\r\nsterility over there, at least for me. I just can't see myself without this\r\nmixture that the West Side is.\" De Ruth has been going to the same\r\nChinese laundry for 28 years -- Jack's on Columbus Avenue. Another\r\nbusiness he has patronized all that time is Schneider's Art Supplies at 75th\r\nStreet and Columbus.\r\n\r\nAs the interview comes to a close, I ask De Ruth what advice he would\r\ngive to an aspiring young artist. \"Never be discouraged by anyone or\r\nanything,\" he says. Then, to balance his remarks, he relates an anecdote\r\nabout an art student who asked Degas what he could do to help the world\r\nof art. Replied Degas: \"Stop painting.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MIGNON DUNN\r\nThe Met's super mezzo\r\n\r\n3-8-80\r\n\r\nDon't look for opera posters, photographs or reviews on the walls of\r\nMignon Dunn's Westside apartment. The Tennessee-born Metropolitan\r\nOpera star, one of the world's most sought-after mezzo-sopranos since the\r\nearly 1970s, prefers to keep her two lives separate. She has no scrapbooks\r\nand saves no clippings. \"I look forward to what I'm doing tomorrow,\" she\r\nexplains.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like those stand-up-and-sing roles. I loves to play wicked women.\r\nBut you have to make them just as human as possible,\" she continues, her\r\ngold jewelry jingling as she settles onto the sofa. Tall and attractive, with\r\nlarge, expressive features, Miss Dunn is hospitality personified as she\r\ntalks about her life and career over a glass of wine.\r\n\r\nThis season at the Met she starred in both _Lohengrin_ and _Elektra_. In\r\nthe spring she will appear in _Aida_ on the Met tour, and perform the\r\nrole of Kundry in _Parsifal_ with Germany's Hamburg Opera. After that\r\nshe plans some orchestral and opera concerts across the country. Long\r\npraised for her dramatic talents as well as her vocal skills, Miss Dunn has\r\nalready signed contracts for performances into 1984.\r\n\r\nAlthough a few noted operas, such as _Carmen_, _Samson et Dalila_, and\r\n_Joan of Arc_, have a mezzo in the title role, most operas feature the\r\nhigher-voiced soprano in the lead and a mezzo in a character role. \"We\r\nmay not have the main roles, but we have some of the best parts in\r\n_opera_,\" she says in her rich Southern accent, shouting the last word as\r\nif from an overflow of energy. \"Not many of the roles I get today are\r\nangelic. It's often the 'other woman,' or the woman who causes the\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\nMarried since 1972 to Kurt Klippstatter, a conductor and music director\r\nfrom Austria, Miss Dunn has never had any children of her own,\r\nsomewhat to her regret. But she and her husband frequently have their\r\nnephews and nieces staying for extended periods. \"Our niece Evi, from\r\nAustria, is living with us now. She's like a little daughter, and I adore\r\nher. She's 18, and she's going to go to nursing school.\" Mignon and Kurt\r\nare a very gregarious couple who enjoy throwing huge dinner parties.\r\nMignon's cooking, like her singing, is international.\r\n\r\n\"I cook Austrian. I cook New Orleans. I cook some nice Italian and\r\nFrench things. I'm going to be in Paris later this year for six weeks, and\r\nI really seriously want to go to the Cordon Bleu Cooking School, and take\r\nat least a three-week course.\"\r\n\r\nAround the late 1960s she was based in Germany for several years. There,\r\nsays Dunn, many new operas are premiered each year, while in the U.S.\r\nthey are a rarity. \"It all comes back to the fact that we don't have\r\ngovernment subsidy. We have to worry about selling tickets. Opera is an\r\nexpensive thing, and until we get this government support -- which people\r\nfor some reason are afraid of -- we cannot be as experimental as we\r\nwould like to be.\"\r\n\r\nBrought up on a cotton plantation in Memphis, she entered her first\r\nsinging contest at the age of 9 and spent most Saturday afternoons in her\r\ngirlhood listening with rapt attention to the Metropolitan Opera broadcast\r\non the radio. Immediately following her high school graduation, she was\r\nauditioned by Met scouts and encouraged to go to New York. There, after\r\nseveral years of study, she won a national competition that launched her\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nDunn spent part of three seasons with the New York City Opera before\r\njoining the Met. It was many years, however, before her talents were fully\r\nappreciated there. \"It only took me 11 auditions to get into the New York\r\nCity Opera, and at least that many at the Met. So take heart, everybody,\"\r\nshe says, laughing merrily.\r\n\r\nShe has made numerous opera recordings, including the role of Susan B.\r\nAnthony in Virgil Thompson's _The Mother of Us All_ and Maddalena\r\nin _Rigoletto_. \"I don't ever listen to my recordings,\" she says when\r\nasked to name her favorite. \"I listen to the playbacks, when I can do\r\nsomething about it. But I don't listen to recordings afterwards because\r\nthere's nothing that I can do about it, and I know I'm going to find a\r\nmillion things that I don't like.\"\r\n\r\nMignon and her husband recently bought a house in Connecticut, but they\r\nwill keep their Westside apartment. \"We have three acres,\" she says\r\nproudly. \"I hope we'll get a couple of horses and I would love a goat. I\r\nlove goats. They're so cute. I love animals -- we have a Great Dane and\r\na Labrador -- and I'm very much into the business with the Animal\r\nProtection Institute. Most of the experiments that are done with animals\r\ntoday: there's just no reason for it. ... I mean, I don't think we need\r\nanother shampoo on the market, really.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice rises with feeling as she pursues the subject. \"It is really the\r\nslavery of today. People don't have any feelings for animals, and I'm just\r\nrabid. I really am. It is so _disgraceful_. Anytime anybody wants me to\r\ndo a benefit for animals, just call me and I'll do it any day I've got free.\r\nI would like to do more benefits. Actually, I'm hardly ever asked to, but\r\nif I were asked, I would do it.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS JR.\r\nA man for all seasons\r\n\r\n7-14-79\r\n\r\nSix times he has received an advance to write his autobiography, and six\r\ntimes he has returned the money because of the enormity of the task. The\r\nlife of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is too rich and varied to be condensed into\r\na one-volume narrative.\r\n\r\nThe only child of Douglas Fairbanks Sr., America's first great matinee\r\nidol, he has acted in more than 75 feature films, produced 160 television\r\nplays and a dozen movies, performed in countless stage plays and\r\nmusicals, made numerous recordings, written screenplays, published his\r\narticles and drawings in many of the nation's leading magazines, and\r\ngiven his time freely to at least 50 public service organizations. Ten\r\ncountries on four continents have presented him with major awards for his\r\ndiplomatic and philanthropic activities.\r\n\r\n\"One morning I woke up and said, 'I suppose I must have retired,'\" notes\r\nthe tanned, vigorous 69-year-old at his Madison Avenue office, from\r\nbehind his huge antique desk with brass lions' heads for drawer pulls. But\r\nin our long discussion, it becomes obvious that he has never actually\r\nretired, either as an entertainer or as a force in public affairs. His office\r\nis fairly cluttered with mementoes of his world travels -- swords,\r\nstatuettes, novelty lamps, old photographs, oversized travel books. The\r\nwhite-haired, melodious-voiced actor sits looking very comfortable as he\r\ntells about his ongoing stage career.\r\n\r\n\"My favorite type of work right now is doing plays for limited periods.\r\nIn 1940 I gave up stage acting, but in 1968 I did the first big revival of\r\n_My Fair Lady_, and since then I have been in several other plays. This\r\nsummer I'm doing _My Fair Lady_ again in Reno for eight to 10 weeks.\r\n... I didn't want to copy Rex Harrison, but I was prevailed upon by\r\nLerner and Loewe to do this. I've known them since before they knew\r\neach other. They're going to make a number of adjustments for me. My\r\nother project, which is still in the planning stages, is a new Broadway\r\nshow. But it's really too soon to talk about it.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 13, the classic 1939 film _Gunga Din_, in which Fairbanks co\r\nstars with Cary Grant, will be shown at 9 p.m. on Channel 9 with a single\r\ncommercial-interruption. His other hit films include _Sinbad the Sailor_\r\nand _The Prisoner of Zenda._ He acted in his first movie in 1923 while\r\nbarely in his teens, and in 1932 he was designated a star. He continued to\r\nmake films until 1941, when he joined the U.S. armed forces and served\r\nfor more than five years. Then he resumed his film career with much\r\nsuccess before turning his hand to producing in 1952.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody misuses the word 'star' today,\" he explains. \"Legally, it only\r\nmeans having your name above the title. There's no such thing as a\r\nsuperstar. That's a term we have let creep into the language. Actually\r\nCharlie Chaplin may have been a superstar, but he's one of the very few.\"\r\nHe laughs and tells about another aspect of modern-day moviemaking that\r\namuses him. \"Very few of the great producers in the past paid any\r\nattention to credits at all. Now, they all like to get their names in the\r\nbilling and in the ads, as big as the stars' names -- as if anybody cares\r\nwho made the film!\"\r\n\r\nAsked whether his career was helped by having a famous father in the\r\nmovie business, he replies that \"the advantages were ephemeral. They\r\nwere limited to people being polite and nice, but that wouldn't necessarily\r\nlead to any jobs. It usually meant that I would be underpaid rather than\r\noverpaid, and they would expect more of me. By the time I became a star,\r\nmy father had already retired.\"\r\n\r\nHis stepmother Mary Pickford, \"America's sweetheart,\" who died in May\r\nat the age of 86, joined with Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Charlie Chaplin and\r\nD.W. Griffith in 1919 to found United Artists. The following year she\r\nmarried Fairbanks, and together they virtually ruled Hollywood. Douglas\r\nJunior, who became close to his father only in his late teens, grew up in\r\nNew York, Hollywood, London and Paris -- which helps to explain his\r\nlove for travel and his endless quest for variety.\r\n\r\nAs the creative force behind the acclaimed TV series _Douglas Fairbanks\r\nPresents_, he produced an average of 32 one-hour films a year from 1952\r\nand 1957. \"My studio manager had a heart attack and my story editor had\r\na nervous breakdown, just from the pressure of getting out these films. I\r\nthought I would be next, so I decided to quit,\" he says. \"They were very\r\nelaborate productions. We used to have the scripts six months in advance.\r\nNow, if you start shooting on Tuesday, you'll get the script on Monday.\"\r\n\r\nToday, with his multiple business interests and philanthropic pursuits, he\r\nmaintains a house in Florida, an office in London, and, since 1956, an\r\napartment on the Upper East Side. He and his wife Mary have been\r\nmarried for 40 years and have three daughters, two of whom live in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHis overall career, concludes Fairbanks, \"does not have a single theme,\r\nbecause it's been so diversified. It's been a series of themes. Maybe it's\r\ncacophonous. The things I find most interesting don't pay a penny. But\r\npossibly all my activities blended together have something to do with a\r\nperson who's got a lot of curiosity and energy and capacity to enjoy and\r\nappreciate life.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LEE FALK\r\nCreator of The Phantom and Mandrake the Magician\r\n\r\n5-27-78\r\n\r\nWho is the most widely read author in the world today?\r\n\r\nNot counting Chairman Mao, whose quotations are required reading for\r\none-fourth of the earth's population, the honor probably belongs to a\r\ndapper, soft-spoken man in his early 60s who could walk from his\r\nWestside apartment all the way to Times Square without being recognized.\r\nHe is not a familiar figure on book jackets or talk shows because Lee Falk\r\nhappens to be a comic strip writer. His two creations, The Phantom and\r\nMandrake the Magician, are published in more than 500 newspapers in 40\r\ncountries. His daily readership: close to 100 million.\r\n\r\n\"One of the few places in the world where my strips don't run is in New\r\nYork City,\" says Falk, leaning gently forward in his chair. \"They ran in\r\nthe _New York Journal American_ for 25 years. That was the biggest\r\nafternoon paper in America until the newspaper strike, about 10 years\r\nago. Then it folded, as did most of New York's papers; we were left with\r\nthe _Times_, the _Post_, and the _Daily News_. But my strips do run in\r\n_El Diario_, the Spanish-language newspaper, and in the _New York\r\nNews World_.\"\r\n\r\nHe arrived in New York from Missouri during the Great Depression,\r\nwhile still in his teens, carrying a sample strip he had written and drawn.\r\nKing Features bought Mandrake the Magician and two years later added\r\nThe Phantom to their syndicate.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Falk did both the drawing and the writing himself.\r\n\"Then for a long time I used to make rough sketches and give them to my\r\nartists,\" he recalls. \"Now I just give a description of each panel. I might\r\nsay 'close-up' or 'long shot' like you do in a film. Then I put in the\r\ndialogue. ... Some of my early artists are dead. They've gone on to their\r\nreward -- to that big bar up in the sky, where all artists go. ... Now\r\nthere's one group drawing my strips on Long Island, and another one on\r\nCape Cod. Very often I don't see them from one year to the next.\r\nCollaboration works best that way.\"\r\n\r\nSince giving up his drawing pad, Falk has increased his literary output\r\nmany times over. Besides doing all the writing for his strips for the past\r\n40-odd years -- which now takes up but a small part of his time -- he has\r\nwritten five novels and a dozen plays. He owns five theatres; he has\r\ndirected about 100 plays and produced 300. None of his own dramatic\r\nworks has been a big commercial success, although one is currently doing\r\nwell in Paris. Then there was the comedy that he co-authored with a\r\nyoung American he met in Rome just before World War II. \"It almost\r\nmade it to Broadway,\" says Falk. \"It was redone about two years ago on\r\nthe West Coast. My collaborator was there to see it too; we've remained\r\nfriends to this day. You may have heard of the man. He's a senator from\r\nCalifornia, the senate majority whip. His name is Alan Cranston. ... You\r\nsee, it's best to save the punch line for the end.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of Falk's main pastimes is travel. He has visited enough islands,\r\njungles, and out-of-the-way places to keep the story ideas flowing for\r\nyears to come, but his appetite is still unwhetted. Early this year he toured\r\nScandinavia, when \"they were making a big fuss about the Phantom's\r\nmarriage. There were so many press conferences to attend. One guy made\r\nme wear a mask, and the next day as I got on the plane, there was my\r\npicture on the front page. I said, 'But your paper doesn't even run The\r\nPhantom.' He said, 'The Phantom belongs to all of Norway.'\"\r\n\r\nIn April of this year, Lee and his wife Elizabeth, a cosmetics executive\r\nturned mystery writer, spent three weeks in the People's Republic of\r\nChina. Ironically, although that is one of the few places in the world\r\nwhere Falk's name is completely unknown, neither he nor anyone else in\r\nhis touring group could escape the public eye. \"They were fascinated by\r\nseeing us, because for a whole generation the Chinese have been shut off\r\nfrom foreign visitors. They crowded around us 10 deep, and held up their\r\nbabies.\"\r\n\r\nAn action-oriented man who loves to play tennis, ride his bicycle, and go\r\nswimming, Falk has lived on the West Side for over 20 years because \"I\r\nfind the East Side a little too chichi for my tastes.\" Another Westside\r\ncharacteristic he likes is the abundance of Puerto Rican residents:\r\n\"They're very sweet, gentle people. ... [Deputy Mayor] Herman Badillo\r\nis an old friend of mine. He knew my comic strips from Puerto Rico.\"\r\n\r\nLee Falk estimates that \"over a period of 40 years I must have written\r\nabout 800 to 1,000 stories. They would fill this whole room.\" Where does\r\nhe get his inspiration? \"A lot of it comes from my travels. It's all grist for\r\nthe mill. Now and then I see something in the news and adapt it to my\r\nfeatures. For example, once I saw a story in _Life_ magazine about a\r\nSwiss scientist who was experimenting with back-breeding. He managed\r\nto breed some European cattle back to the original aurochs, which has\r\nbeen extinct for several hundred years. ... I put his idea into Mandrake.\r\nA scientist started with a lizard and ended up with a dinosaur.\"\r\n\r\nThe veteran storyteller never gets tired of spinning his yarns. \"I enjoy it.\r\nIt's something I can do. ... Both The Phantom and Mandrake are\r\ntranslated into about 20 languages. After all these years, they're bigger\r\nthan ever -- except in this country, because we've lost so many papers.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER BARRY FARBER\r\nRadio talkmaster and linguist\r\n\r\n8-12-78\r\n\r\n\"Dull\" is a word that could never be used to describe Barry Farber. He\r\nis a totally unique individual with so many far-reaching ideas that his\r\nconservative label seems to fit him poorly, even though it was as a\r\nconservative that he ran for mayor of New York last year and garnered\r\nalmost as many votes as his Republican opponent Roy Goodman.\r\n\r\nDuring that campaign, Barry quit the syndicated talk show on WOR Radio\r\nthat he had hosted for 16 years. In March of this year his mesmerizing\r\nSouthern drawl took over the 4 to 7 p.m. Monday to Friday time slot on\r\nWMCA (570 AM). The ratings have gone up at least 50% since he joined\r\nthe station.\r\n\r\nI meet Barry for an interview one August afternoon at a Chinese\r\nrestaurant near the studio. To my amazement he orders the meal entirely\r\nin Cantonese. Then he withdraws a stack of index cards from his pocket\r\non which are printed vocabulary words in Finnish, Italian, and Mandarin\r\nchinese -- a few of the 14 languages that he studies during spare moments\r\nin his hectic work week.\r\n\r\nThe lank 48-year-old, neatly garbed in a pin-stripe suit, is surprisingly\r\nlow-keyed in our hour-long conversation. Yet the verbal gems still trip as\r\nneatly off his tongue as they do when he's putting an irate telephone caller\r\nin his place, to the delight of radio listeners. Never hesitant to voice his\r\nopinion on any topic, Barry pounces on my questions with an eagerness\r\nthat belies his calm exterior.\r\n\r\nNew York's reputation outside the city limits, says the widely travelled\r\nFarber, has gone way downhill in recent decades. \"It used to be, where\r\nI grew up, that people would brag about coming to New York four times\r\na year. Today they brag about never coming here. The large companies\r\nsend their salesmen to Manhattan for a 45-minute conference like an\r\nEntebbe raid. ... New York needs not a slow, gradual, ho-hum comeback.\r\nIt needs a dramatic voice who is going to say that the city's priorities for\r\nthe last 40 years have been wrong. New York is a sexy woman who's\r\nbeen running around in the mud. Turn the hose on her and she's going to\r\nregain her allure.\"\r\n\r\nThe tax revolt, he believes, \"should definitely come to New York. You\r\ncannot expect to live as sinfully economically as we've lived, and avoid\r\na rampage. The politicians have brought this upon themselves. And don't\r\nlet them get away with telling us that they have to cut police, firemen, and\r\nsanitation before they cut themselves, because they don't.\r\n\r\n\"When John Lindsay was mayor, he flung back his head and inhaled the\r\nvapors of the 1960s. And it was left, baby, left. He bet his presidential\r\nhopes on that. But in the last mayoral election, it was the conservatives\r\nwho did the best. Koch was the most conservative Democrat running.\"\r\n\r\nHis anticommunist sentiments come to the surface when the subject turns\r\nto the 1980 Olympics. \"I think we should have never allowed it in\r\nMoscow on the grounds that we have never had the Olympics in a\r\ndictatorship in the modern era. I'd like to see the athletes of the world\r\nsay, 'We're not going to Moscow to play sportive games by rules when\r\nthe Russians live in violation of the rules of civilization itself.' Russia is\r\nguilty of the world's worst cast of unsportsmanlike conduct. ... Yes, we\r\nshould pull out. But the Olympics is small potatoes. I say, start a new\r\nUnited Nations for the free countries of the world -- a UFN, a United\r\nFree Nations, which shall be an association of all nations governed by\r\nlaw, of all free democracies that want to remain free. In 1945, we did not\r\nseek to build a fraternity of dictatorships where tinhorn tyrants would\r\noutvote democracies 10 to one.\"\r\n\r\nBarry has lived on the West Side ever since he came to the city from\r\nGreensboro, North Carolina 21 years ago, and now occupies a 17-room\r\npenthouse overlooking the Hudson River. \"The West Side and the East\r\nSide are like East Berlin and West Berlin in terms of the rigidity of\r\nlifestyle,\" he says. \"There's a feeling on the West Side that we don't have\r\nto impress each other. We know where it's at.\"\r\n\r\nRecently divorced from his Swedish wife, Barry makes frequent overnight\r\ntrips to Sweden to see his children. He has to be back at the WMCA\r\nstudio on Sunday at 11 a.m. for his four-hour live show with guests. Two\r\nweeks ago, he asked Robert Violante, who was shot and partially blinded\r\nby Son of Sam, what it felt like to be shot in the head. Questions like this\r\ntend to provoke as many listeners as they fascinate, and that is why Barry\r\nprefers not to be too specific about his address.\r\n\r\n\"I don't do a Merry Mailman kind of show,\" he says with a half-smile.\r\n\"One of my fantasies is to have a hit man from the Communist Party, the\r\nNazi Party, the PLO, and the Black Panthers approach me from four\r\ndifferent directions and fire all at once -- and I duck.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER SUZANNE FARRELL\r\nStar of the New York City Ballet\r\n\r\n5-19-79\r\n\r\nShe arrived in New York like a fairy princess -- a wondrous creation\r\nwhose beauty and talent left audiences gaping in astonishment. At 16, she\r\nbecame the youngest person ever to join George Balanchine's New York\r\nCity Ballet, and at 19, she was promoted to the rank of principal dancer.\r\nSince that time, 14 seasons have come and gone, but Suzanne Farrell, the\r\ngirl from Cincinnati, is still the darling of America's foremost ballet\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIn a dressing room interview last week at the New York State Theatre, the\r\nslender, angelic-looking Miss Farrell spoke at length about her public and\r\nprivate life, quickly revealing the two qualities that have enabled her to\r\nremain one of the world's top ballerinas for so long. First is her boundless\r\nenergy; second is her genuine love for people and the world of ballet.\r\nWarm, funny, and articulate about her art, she discussed with enthusiasm\r\nthe upcoming television special, _Choreography by Balanchine, Part\r\nOne_, which will be aired May 23 on Channel 13.\r\n\r\n\"This is one of four programs we taped in Nashville,\" she said, in a voice\r\nas clear and melodic as an actress's. \"The name of the ballet I'm in is\r\n_Tzigane_; the music is by Ravel. We did the finale before the beginning\r\nbecause they wanted to let go the four extra couples that were needed for\r\nthat part. It was very strange -- like having dessert before the meal.\" She\r\nlaughed lightly, tossing back her long, silky brown hair. \"The TV studio\r\nis very small, and the camera sees things differently than the audience sees\r\nwhen you're on stage. Things that are done in a circle look like an oval.\r\nAnd diagonal movement has to be done in a straight line.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne's brightest moment in the program is a solo at the beginning,\r\nwhich she performs to the music of a solo violin. \"One of the things I like\r\nabout doing ballet on television is that you can reach many people who\r\nhave never seen live dance before. About two years ago I got a beautiful\r\nletter from an older man in Oklahoma who was certainly not in the habit\r\nof writing fan letters. Now, every time I tape a new program, I think of\r\nthat man.\r\n\r\n\"_Tzigane_ is one of my favorite ballets, because it was the first one that\r\nBalanchine choreographed for me after I returned to the company in\r\n1974.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1969, Suzanne left the New York City Ballet and spent the next four\r\nseasons with Maurice Bejart's Ballet of the 20th Century in Brussels,\r\nBelgium. When she finally wrote to Balanchine to find out the chances of\r\ndancing with him again, he simply asked when she could start.\r\n\r\n\"In Brussels, the type of ballet they're used to is different, so they react\r\ndifferently. If you were to give them a beautiful, wonderfully stark ballet,\r\nwith little costume and scenery, they might not take to it as much. ... But\r\nit was a good thing to have in my career. I demand that I get something\r\nconstructive out of any situation. Because life is so short that you can't\r\nafford to not give everything, every time you go out there.\"\r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years she has been married to Paul Mejia, a former dancer\r\nwho is today the artistic director and choreographer for the Ballet de\r\nGuatemala, one of Latin America's major companies. Although the couple\r\nmust undergo some long separations, their marriage is a happy one.\r\nSpending time alone at her Lincoln Center area apartment does not bother\r\nSuzanne. With a steady diet of exercise classes, rehearsals and\r\nperformances, and her nine pets (eight cats and a dog), Suzanne has little\r\ntime to be lonely.\r\n\r\n\"When I have a free night, it's terrible,\" she lamented, \"because every\r\ntime the phone rings, I think, 'Oh no, they want me for a performance.'\r\nI dance just about every night. By the time I go to bed, it's about 2\r\no'clock. I happen to get up about 6. ... On Monday, my free day, I teach\r\nat the American School of Ballet. It's such a shock to do two\r\nperformances on Saturday and Sunday, and none on Monday. It's hardly\r\nworth it, because the body can't adjust. ... I have always thought that\r\nactors have it easier than dancers, because it doesn't matter so much how\r\ntired your body is: all you need is your mouth.\"\r\n\r\nA Westsider for most of her career, Suzanne lists reading and cooking as\r\nher preferred pastimes: \"I'm a great short-order cook. I think if I weren't\r\na dancer, I'd be a waitress.\" Two local restaurants she likes to frequent\r\nare Rikyu (210 Columbus Ave.) and Victor's Cafe (240 Columbus).\r\n\r\nAsked about her salary, Suzanne admitted that \"you'll never make a lot\r\nof money in ballet. It's something we do because we love it, and we have\r\nto do it to be happy. ... The sole attraction is working for Balanchine and\r\nthe New York City Ballet: that's something you can't put down in dollars\r\nand cents. I just assume that the company is paying us as much as they\r\ncan.\" She smiled radiantly and added: \"Most dancers wouldn't know what\r\nto do with a lot of money anyway, because they wouldn't have time to\r\nspend it.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JULES FEIFFER\r\nScreenwriter for _Popeye the Sailor_\r\n\r\n11-5-77\r\n\r\nImagine a movie starring Dustin Hoffman as Popeye the Sailor and Lily\r\nTomlin as his girlfriend Olive Oyl.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has seen the old Popeye cartoons, or the new computer\r\nanimated ones, might think that the fighting mariner does not have the\r\ndramatic qualities needed for a full-length film. But according to\r\nWestsider Jules Feiffer, who is now writing the script for _Popeye the\r\nSailor_, the original comic strip in the daily newspapers was the work of\r\n\"an unrecognized genius.\" E.C. Segar created Popeye and drew him from\r\n1924 to 1938. After that the character changed. Feiffer finds the original\r\nstrip to be his biggest source of inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"The cartoons,\" says Feiffer, sitting on one arm of a chair in his Riverside\r\nDrive apartment, \"exploit the violence between Popeye and Bluto. That\r\nwas never part of the strip. It's more along the lines of the traditional\r\ncartoon of the 1940s, which could find nothing more interesting than one\r\ncharacter dismembering another. I didn't find that funny when I was a kid\r\nand I don't now.\"\r\n\r\nFeiffer developed his unique style of humor long before he sold his first\r\ncartoon. Today, though still perhaps best known as a cartoonist, he has\r\ngained a reputation as a playwright for both the stage (_Knock, Knock_\r\nand _Little Murders_) and the screen (_Carnal Knowledge_). He is also\r\na respected prose writer, having recently published his second novel,\r\n_Ackroyd_.\r\n\r\nA product of the Bronx, Feiffer recalls that after graduating from high\r\nschool he went through \"a series of schlock jobs to buy food and drawing\r\nmaterials. And long periods of unemployment.\" He planned all along to\r\nbecome a cartoonist. \"I was prepared,\" he says, \"for the eventual success\r\nwhich I was certain was going to happen if my work remained true to\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nFeiffer spent several years as an assistant to other cartoonists and attended\r\ntwo art schools. Still, no one would publish his work until a day in 1956\r\nwhen Feiffer, age 27, took a batch of his best 'toons to the office of a\r\nnew, relatively unknown weekly called _The Village Voice_. They loved\r\nhis work, and he became a regular contributor.\r\n\r\n\"All other publications at that time had their own idea of their readership.\r\nAnd editors insisted on tailoring stories to their own taste. The _Voice_,\"\r\nsays Feiffer, \"existed for the artist's taste and the writer's taste. It was a\r\ntime when McCarthyism and the blacklist were rampant through every\r\nstrata of society.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Voice_ was then the only publication of its kind. It wrote about\r\ndissent; it was considered revolutionary, and Feiffer's weekly cartoons\r\nhelped it to maintain that image.\r\n\r\nSuccess came quickly to Feiffer after he joined the _Village Voice_: \"It\r\nhappened faster than I thought. It was only about three months or so\r\nbefore my work came to be talked about, and publishers began to offer\r\nbook contracts.\" Syndication took place a few years later. Now the\r\ncartoon is carried by somewhat over 100 publications in every country of\r\nthe western world and several in the Far East.\r\n\r\nFeiffer's cartoon takes him one day a week to conceive and draw. During\r\nthe other six days he works on his latest writing project. For three years\r\n-- until it was published this past summer -- that project was _Ackroyd_,\r\nan unconventional detective-type novel in which the characters are too\r\nhuman to keep their traditional roles as props for the detective's\r\ncleverness. The book is less suspenseful than a standard detective novel,\r\nbut more revealing of human nature.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that has been in my work for many years,\" says Feiffer,\r\n\"is people's need to communicate with each other not directly, but in\r\ncode. ... Coded language is used to guide our lives, to frame our\r\nrelationships with people.\" Feiffer's main character takes the name Roger\r\nAckroyd and tries to become a private detective. Instead he gets \"so\r\nintertwined with the coded life of his clients that he works on that for the\r\nrest of his career.\"\r\n\r\n_Ackroyd_ got extremely mixed reviews. \"It's what I'm used to,\" notes\r\nthe author. \"Some reviews have been glowing. Others wondered what the\r\nhell the book was about and why I bothered to write it.\" Feiffer takes the\r\ngood and the bad in stride, remembering what happened when his first\r\nplay, _Little Murders_, opened on Broadway in 1967.\r\n\r\n\"It got all negative reviews and closed in a week,\" he recalls. \"It was\r\nimmediately done in London after that, which started the revival, because\r\nit was done very successfully. Then it was brought back to New York the\r\nfollowing year and it won all the awards.\" In 1971 it was made into a\r\nsuccessful film starring Elliott Gould and Marcia Rodd.\r\n\r\nAn occasional theatregoer, Feiffer ends the interview on a customary\r\ndepressing note, saying that he is generally disappointed by even the\r\nbiggest hits in town.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think of myself as a Broadway playwright,\" he says. \"I'd be\r\nashamed of that title. I don't think the Broadway theatre is very interesting\r\nor has been for the last 20 years.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER GERALDINE FITZGERALD\r\nActress, director and singer\r\n\r\n3-15-80\r\n\r\nAnyone hearing her rasping, throaty, Irish-accented voice for the first time\r\nmight think she were suffering from laryngitis. But those who have come\r\nto love and admire Geraldine Fitzgerald over the past 40 years hear\r\nnothing but earthy humanity in the voice. One of the most versatile\r\nactresses in America, as unorthodox as she is gifted, Miss Fitzgerald at\r\n66 remains at the height of her career, constantly juggling a variety of\r\nprojects, as she says, \"like somebody cooking a meal with many courses.\"\r\n\r\nWe're sitting in her Upper East Side living room, which is decorated in\r\nwhite from floor to ceiling -- carpet, chairs, tables, sofa, and even the\r\ntelevision. The only picture is a childhood portrait of her daughter Susan\r\nScheftel, now a 27-year-old graduate student.\r\n\r\n\"I like light unimpeded,\" explains Geraldine, her rosy face breaking into\r\nits customary smile. \"And if everything is white, it's different in the\r\nmorning and it's different in the middle of the day, and it's different all\r\nthe time.\"\r\n\r\nA slender, handsome woman with a penchant for long flowing skirts and\r\nbright lipstick, whose straight gray hair descends halfway down her back,\r\nGeraldine is soon talking about _Mass Appeal_, the two-character play\r\nthat she is directing at the Manhattan Theatre Club; it will open in mid\r\nMay. \"It's by a very young author called Bill Davis. We did it last\r\nOctober at the Circle Rep Lab, and it was very successful, but it needed\r\nstrengthening points. So Bill has just completed the ninth draft. ... Milo\r\nO'Shea is going to star in it. He's Ireland's premier comedian and a\r\nmagnificent dramatic actor too.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Fitzgerald's next acting role will be in a play titled _Eve._ \"It's\r\nabout a woman who runs away from home to seek her own internal\r\nfreedom, like Nora in _A Doll's House_. The only difference is, she's my\r\nage. So of course her options are few. And she goes right down to the\r\nbottom: she becomes a derelict. And then slowly, slowly, slowly she\r\ncomes up to find some kind of strength and independence. It's a drama,\r\nbut a very comedic drama.\"\r\n\r\nHer third major project at the moment is to prepare her acclaimed one\r\nwoman show, _Street Songs_, for a small Broadway house such as the\r\nRialto.\r\n\r\nShe started to take singing lessons about 10 years ago, and introduced her\r\none-woman nightclub act in 1975, employing her remarkable acting\r\ntechnique to make the songs personal and moving. She has performed the\r\nact at Reno Sweeney, at Lincoln Center, in a one-hour special for public\r\ntelevision, and at the White House for President and Mrs. Carter.\r\n\r\n\"I don't sing what's called 'folk songs.' People think I do. I sing songs\r\nthat are very -- winning. Because the songs that people sing when they're\r\non their own -- whether singing in the streets, singing in the shower,\r\nsinging in the car -- they do not sing losing songs. We didn't know that\r\nfor a long time. 'We' is Richard Maltby Jr., who did _Ain't\r\nMisbehavin'_. He's my colleague and partner and he directed it.\r\n\r\n\"At first we couldn't understand why a marvelous song like 'Loch\r\nLomond' was sort of rejected by the audience, and then a song like\r\n'Danny Boy', that you'd think everybody's sick of, was acceptable. Well,\r\n'Danny Boy,' believe it or not, is a winning song. At the end of it, the\r\ngirl says, 'Even if I'm dead, if you come back and you whisper that you\r\nlove me still, I'll hear you in my grave.' And then I'll know that you'll\r\nbe beside me for eternity. Whereas 'Loch Lomond' starts off so well, but\r\neach verse says 'But me and my true love will never meet again ... \"\r\n\r\nShe began her acting career at the Gate Theatre in Dublin while in her\r\nteens, came to the U.S. in 1937, and acted with Orson Welles' Mercury\r\nTheatre on the Air before heading for Hollywood, where she made such\r\nclassic films as _Dark Victory, Watch on the Rhine_, and _Wuthering\r\nHeights_, for which she received an Oscar nomination. In 1946 she settled\r\non Manhattan's East Side, and has been based there ever since, although\r\nshe frequently returns to Hollywood to act in movies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps even better known for her stage roles, she names Eugene\r\nO'Neill's poignant, autobiographical _Long Day's Journey Into Night_ as\r\nher favorite play. When it was revived Off Broadway in 1971, her\r\nportrayal of the morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone became the biggest hit\r\nof her stage career. Miss Fitzgerald has recorded this play and others for\r\nCaedmon Records.\r\n\r\nMarried to Stuart Scheftel, a wealthy executive and producer, she has one\r\nson from a previous marriage, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, the hugely\r\nsuccessful young director who was nominated for a Tony Award for\r\n_Whose Life is this Anyway?_ Miss Fitzgerald is the first actress ever to\r\nreceive the Handel Medallion, New York's highest cultural award.\r\n\r\nIf Geraldine has one regret about her career, it is that it took her \"so\r\nmany decades to get up the courage to sing. Everybody told me not to,\r\nbecause I have such a funny voice. ... Then I realized that I needed a\r\nvehicle for expressing what I feel about the world and about people that\r\nwas very flexible, and was mine. And if the audience would put up with\r\nthe harsh sounds, then I could use it. And evidently they can, so if they\r\ncan now, I guess they always could.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JOAN FONTAINE\r\nActress turns author with _No Bed of Roses_\r\n\r\n12-30-78\r\n\r\nThe Oscar statuette stands on the end of a shelf about eight feet off the\r\nfloor, partially obscured by a row of books, its gold surface gleaming\r\ndully in the subdued light of the room. Below, in one of the apartment's\r\nfour fireplaces, a small log is softly burning. This room, like the rest of\r\nthe large, immaculate home, is furnished in the style of an early 20th\r\ncentury country manor. Here, in the heart of the Upper East Side, Joan\r\nFontaine has spent 15 years of an immensely productive life. I take a seat\r\non one side of the fire, and Miss Fontaine faces me from the opposite side\r\nof the room, her slender, regal form resting comfortably in an antique\r\nchair, to talk about her best-selling autobiography, _No Bed Of Roses_\r\n(Morrow, $9.95). Published in September, the book has already sold more\r\nthan 75,000 copies in hardcover.\r\n\r\nAs the title implies, Miss Fontaine's life has been one long roller coaster\r\nride of triumph and tragedy. During the 1940s she received three Oscar\r\nnominations for Best Actress in the space of four years, and won the\r\naward for _Suspicion_ (1941). She had the joy of raising two children --\r\none of them adopted -- but the disappointment of four divorces. Her\r\nmother, who died in 1975, was the best friend she has ever known, yet\r\nboth her father and her stepfather gave her nothing but unhappiness, and\r\nshe never had a close relationship with her famous older sister, Olivia de\r\nHavilland. In fact, the pair have not spoken in years -- for reasons clearly\r\nexplained in Fontaine's book.\r\n\r\nA fiercely independent woman who has flown her own airplane and taken\r\npart in international ballooning competition, she has suffered through\r\nnumerous illnesses and injuries that brought her close to permanent\r\ndisability or death. These are the elements of _No Bed Of Roses_, a\r\ndisarmingly frank memoir that is frequently unsettling but never boring.\r\n\r\n\"The fan mail for this book is getting to be enormous,\" says Fontaine, still\r\nradiant at 61. \"A lot of people identify with the illnesses, or with trying\r\nto bring up children alone. Some people empathize because they had harsh\r\nrelations with their siblings. A lot of men have told me they cried at the\r\nend, in my epitaph to my mother. And then of course, I have heard from\r\na lot of people who wanted to be actresses, or actors.\"\r\n\r\nDid she write the entire book herself? \"Every single word. I wouldn't let\r\nthem touch one of them. ... It's not a sordid book; it's not tacky. One\r\nreviewer said it was immoral. I don't think I can figure that out. If you\r\nask me, it's rather religious.\"\r\n\r\nThe words come out like perfect silver beads. She has always been a\r\nformidable presence on the screen, and is no less so in person, as she\r\ngives her unrestrained opinions on every topic introduced.\r\n\r\nMarriage, says Fontaine, is \"waiting on -- or waiting for somebody.\"\r\nAsked whether she believes two average people can remain happily\r\nmarried for a lifetime, she replies: \"It depends how hypocritical they are,\r\nand how much lying they want to do. ... I think the word 'love' means an\r\nentirely different thing to a woman than it does to a man.\"\r\n\r\nHer classic movies, including _Rebecca, Jane Eyre, Suspicion_, and _This\r\nAbove All_, are frequently seen on television now, but Fontaine has little\r\nrespect for television as a medium: \"I consider it nothing more than B\r\npictures. I think we took a little more care with B pictures; the actors and\r\nactresses got a chance. In a television film, if the actor slips on a word,\r\nto hell with it. We'll cut around it.\"\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Fontaine appeared in the made-for-television movie _The\r\nUsers_, starring Jaclyn Smith. She could do many others, but prefers to\r\nbe choosy. \"The quality of the scripts is so poor. I think it's the taste of\r\nthe times. It's a brutal world; it's a vulgar world. ... It's quite different\r\nfrom the romance of Jane Eyre. I don't think I could act those roles. I'd\r\nrather sit in my library in front of the fire.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, she has little time for sitting around: her acting talents are too\r\nmuch in demand, in dinner theatres and in college auditoriums around the\r\ncountry. Recently she returned from a three-month working trip. In\r\nFebruary she'll be opening in Dallas. \"I haven't decided on the play yet,\"\r\nshe says.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her words, she somehow comes off as being thoroughly\r\ncharming. A highly sociable woman who loves to attend cocktail parties\r\nand make new acquaintances, Fontaine is also a gourmet cook. \"At\r\nChristmas I cook for about 75 people. No one married can come. I'm\r\nthrilled that one of my friends has just gotten divorced. Now she can\r\ncome.\" Among the Eastside restaurants that Fontaine visits frequently are\r\n21 and the Four Seasons.\r\n\r\nWhen she has time to herself, Fontaine enjoys reading literature and\r\nadapting it for her lectures. \"I lecture on many subjects,\" she says. \"I do\r\nthe entire Jane Eyre -- all the roles. It takes about an hour and a half. It's\r\nmore like a film reading than a lecture. I do one on American poets, and\r\none on Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning -- all their own words.\r\nThen a new one has crept up -- if I may say so, by popular demand --\r\ncalled 'The Golden Years.' I tell how to do it -- how to make these years\r\nthe best. I've never felt so happy or so free or so contented as I am now.\"\r\nborn 10-22-17\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER BETTY FRIEDAN\r\nFounder of the women's liberation movement\r\n\r\n7-14-79\r\n\r\nOne of the most-discussed nonfiction works published in 1978 was _The\r\n100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History_ by\r\nastrophysicist Michael H. Hart. He writes: \"My criterion was neither fame\r\nnor talent nor nobility of character, but actual personal influence on the\r\ncourse of human history and on the everyday lives of individuals.\" Seven\r\nnative-born Americans were included in the 100, and when _People_\r\nmagazine requested Hart to expand his list of Americans to 25, the first\r\nname he added was that of Betty Friedan, who, he said, \"through\r\nwomen's liberation, has already had a greater impact than most\r\npresidents.\"\r\n\r\nThe book that did most to trigger the women's movement was Friedan's\r\n_The Feminine Mystique_ (1963), a brilliant analysis of the postwar \"back\r\nto the home\" movement, when women were led to believe that they could\r\nfind fulfillment only through childbearing and housework. That myth, said\r\nFriedan, resulted in a sense of emptiness and loss of identity for millions\r\nof American women. Her book became an international best-seller, and\r\nhas been translated into more than a dozen languages.\r\n\r\nBut _The Feminine Mystique_ was only the first of many contributions\r\nthat Friedan has made to the women's movement. In 1966 she founded the\r\nNational Organization for Women (NOW), which today has more than\r\n70,000 members and is by far the most effective feminist group in the\r\nworld. She has written a second book, _It Changed My Life_, made\r\ncountless appearances on radio and television, and become one of the most\r\nsought-after lecturers in the country. Despite her public image as a hard\r\ncore activist, Betty Friedan at 58 is a charming, decidedly feminine\r\nwoman who enjoys wearing makeup and colorful dresses. In an interview\r\nat her brightly decorated apartment high above Lincoln Center, she reveals\r\nthat these two aspects of her personality are not at all contradictory.\r\n\r\n\"The women's movement had to come. It was an evolutionary thing,\" she\r\nsays, in robust, throaty, rapid-fire bursts of speech interspersed with long\r\npauses. \"If I had not articulated these ideas in 1963, by '66 somebody else\r\nwould have. I think that it's good that I did, because what I had to say\r\nsomehow got to the essence of it, which is the personhood of woman, and\r\nnot what later obscured it, with a woman-against-man kind of thing.\"\r\n\r\nIt was largely through the lobbying efforts of NOW that the U.S. Senate\r\nlast October approved a three-year extension of the deadline for ratifying\r\nthe Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). So far, 35 of the required 38 states\r\nhave voted for the amendment. The new deadline is June 30, 1982.\r\n\r\n\"There's no question that three more states will pass it by that time,\" says\r\nFriedan. \"But it's not going to be easy, because there are these well\r\nfinanced right-wing campaigns trying to block it. They understand that the\r\nERA is not only the symbol but the substance of what women have won\r\n-- that it will give them constitutional underpinning forevermore, so that\r\nthey can't push women back to the second-class status of the cheap labor\r\npool.\r\n\r\n\"The ERA will not do anything dramatic -- like change the bathrooms --\r\nbut it will ensure, for example, that women have their own right for social\r\nsecurity, which they don't have now. You have to realize that the\r\nreactionary forces in this country are using the sexual issue as a kind of\r\nsmoke screen, to create a hate movement. They're the same forces that\r\ntried to prevent labor from organizing, that burnt crosses on lawns in the\r\nSouth, that painted swastikas on synagogues. ... NOW has made it _the_\r\npriority, because if the ERA is blocked, it will be the signal to take back\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\nA woman who smiles and laughs easily in spite of her intensity, Friedan\r\nprefers to be called not Miss, Ms., or Mrs., but simply Betty. Born in\r\nPeoria, Illinois, she majored in psychology at Smith College and\r\ngraduated summa cum laude. In June, 1947, after moving to New York\r\nCity, she married Carl Friedan, then a theatrical producer. Three children\r\nlater, the Friedans moved to the suburbs, and it was there that she\r\nformulated the ideas for _The Feminine Mystique._\r\n\r\nDivorced since 1969, Friedan maintains a very close relationship with her\r\nchildren, who are at Columbia University, the University of California,\r\nBerkeley graduate school, and Harvard Medical School. A Westsider since\r\n1964, she runs in Central Park for an hour each day.\r\n\r\nOf the half dozen major projects she's involved in at the moment, the\r\nmost significant is her new book, _The Fountain of Age._ \"It's about the\r\nlast third of life,\" she explains. \"I call it the new third of life, because\r\nmany women have only begun to discover that it exists.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about her chief pleasures in life, she replies with obvious\r\nsatisfaction, \"I like parties, I like my friends, I like talking, I like dancing.\r\n... One thing I've discovered is that the stronger you get, the more you\r\n_can_ be soft and gentle and tender, and also have fun. I _demand_ my\r\nright to be funny and to have fun, and not just to always be deadly\r\nserious.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ARTHUR FROMMER\r\nAuthor of _Europe on $10 a Day_\r\n\r\n10-8-78\r\n\r\nHis name rhymes with \"roamer\" and that's an accurate description of\r\nWestsider Arthur Frommer, author of _Europe on $10 a Day_.\r\n\r\nIn 1957, when he wrote the first edition, _Europe On $5 a Day_, Arthur\r\nwas a dedicated New York lawyer. But the book became so popular that\r\nhe finally decided, after much agonizing, to leave his law firm and\r\nbecome a full-time travel writer. Every year in the past two decades,\r\nArthur and his wife Hope have revisited the 17 European cities covered\r\nin the book; they have distilled the wisdom from thousands of letters\r\nreceived from readers; and they have revised and updated the famous\r\ntravel book for the new edition each spring. It is still the world's best\r\nselling guide to Europe.\r\n\r\n\"This is not necessarily the glamorous occupation that some people\r\nimagine it to be,\" says Arthur, biting into a sandwich as he, Hope and\r\ntheir daughter Pauline invite me to join them at the dinner table at their\r\nCentral Park West home. \"One of the hazards of being a travel writer is\r\nthat when you're on vacation, you're always checking to see where the\r\nbargains are, or whether the restaurants are worth their reputation. I've\r\nvisited so many exotic cities of the world that for me, the best way to\r\nrelax is to stay home.\"\r\n\r\nDue to a miscommunication on my part, I arrive on an evening exactly\r\none week later than the Frommers have expected me, yet they manage\r\nsuch a warm welcome that I end up staying three hours. They seem to\r\nhave plenty of time to talk. Still, there is a reminder throughout the\r\nevening that they lead very busy lives -- the constantly ringing telephone.\r\n\r\nOne reason for my lengthy visit is that it takes place on the same night as\r\nthe second heavyweight championship boxing match between Muhammad\r\nAli and Leon Spinks. Arthur and I sit on his living room couch, watching\r\nthe fight live on TV with great interest, rooting for Ali and resuming our\r\ninterview between the rounds. Ali, who had lost the first fight with Spinks\r\nthe previous February, beats him handily this time.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a workaholic,\" confesses Arthur, excusing himself while he gets up\r\nto answer another call from overseas. An energetic, detail-oriented man,\r\nArthur once worked 12 hours a day writing legal briefs and eight hours\r\na day on his book. Today he is the head of Arthur Frommer Enterprises,\r\nan international corporation that includes a publishing company, a charter\r\nservice and four hotels -- two in the Caribbean and two in Europe.\r\n\r\nPublishing remains his biggest enterprise. He publishes 30 to 40 travel\r\nguides each year, ranging in subject matter from the Far East to New\r\nYork City. _Europe On $10 A Day_ has for many years been co-authored\r\nby his wife Hope. \"While Arthur is on the streets grubbing for bargains,\"\r\nshe says, \"I'm in the museums.\"\r\n\r\nWith her own career as an actress and director, Hope does not fly the\r\nAtlantic quite as often as her husband. Says Arthur: \"I go to Europe like\r\nother people commute to Long Island. Sometimes I go without even a\r\nchange of clothes.\"\r\n\r\nTwelve-year-old Pauline Frommer made her first trip to Europe at the age\r\nof two and a half months. Bright and precocious, she seems a natural to\r\nsucceed her father in the business one day.\r\n\r\nArthur Frommer's success story began shortly after he graduated from\r\nYale Law School in 1953. While serving in the Army in Europe, he used\r\nevery weekend to travel. \"At the end of my stay in the Army,\" he recalls,\r\n\"having nothing to do, I sat down and wrote a little volume called _The\r\nGI Guide to Europe_. It was written strictly from memory; it had no\r\nprices or phone numbers. I went home and started practicing law. Then\r\nI got a cable saying that all 50,000 copies had sold out immediately.\"\r\n\r\nArthur used his first summer vacation from the law firm to go back to\r\nEurope and rewrite his travel guide, for civilian readers. It became \"a\r\nmonster which ate up my life.\" But he has never regretted his choice of\r\ncareers.\r\n\r\n\"The book coincided with a revolution of American travel habits,\" says\r\nArthur, not giving himself credit for being a prime force behind this\r\nrevolution. \"When I was in college, it was unheard of for young people\r\nto go off to Europe. It was too far, too expensive. The students of the\r\nearly 1960s became the first students in history to travel in great numbers\r\nto Europe. Many people think the country was greatly changed by this\r\nmassive travel.\"\r\n\r\nArthur and Hope moved to the West Side in 1965, just after their daughter\r\nwas born. Among their favorite neighborhood businesses: DelPino Shoes,\r\nwhich has some of the lowest prices in the city for quality Italian\r\nfootwear, and the Jean Warehouse, where Pauline buys many of her\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nThese days, while Hope is busy directing a play by Pamela O'Neill,\r\nArthur is working on several new projects. One is a course he will be\r\nteaching at the New School starting in February. Titled \"Great Cities of\r\nWestern Europe,\" the course will concentrate on urban problems and their\r\npolitical and social solutions.\r\n\r\nBut Arthur's biggest ambition these days is to expand his company's\r\nweek-long chartered tour of Jerusalem into a two-week package for\r\nJerusalem and Cairo. Such a tour, he believes, would help create a bond\r\nof understanding in the Middle East.\r\n\r\n\"It's a dream of mine,\" says Arthur, \"that we might be a force for peace\r\nsometime. It may not happen overnight, but I'm sure it will come.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER WILLIAM GAINES\r\nPublisher and founder of _Mad_ magazine\r\n\r\n9-15-79\r\n\r\n_Mad_ magazine, an institution in American humor ever since it first\r\nappeared in 1955, is one of the few publications on the newsstand that\r\ncarries no advertising. In the past few years, rising costs and changing\r\ntastes have driven Mad's circulation slightly below two million, but\r\npublisher William Gaines has no plans of giving in to commercialism.\r\n\r\n\"I was brought up on a newspaper called _PM_,\" recalls Gaines, an\r\ninstantly likable native New Yorker who looks like a cross between Santa\r\nClaus and a middle-aged hippie. \"It sold for a nickel while everything else\r\nwas two cents. Its policy was to take no ads, and I was kind of brought\r\nup on the idea that it's dirty to take advertising.\" His face breaks out in\r\nmerriment, and he laughs the first of many deep, rich, belly laughs that\r\nI am to hear that afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think your publication's going to want to print that, so you'd\r\nbetter leave it out. Um, so I, I. ... I mean, it's not --\" he sputters, before\r\nquickly recovering and driving the point home with his customary\r\njournalistic finesse. \"As a matter of fact, if you're going to take ads, I\r\nthink the way your people do it is the way to do it. If you're _going_ to\r\ntake ads, give the publication away. But if somebody's putting out money,\r\nit's not right. It's like going to the movies and seeing a commercial.\r\nTelevision, fine: you're getting it free.\"\r\n\r\nWe're sitting in his somewhat disorderly Madison Avenue office, which\r\nis decorated with paintings of monsters, huge models of King Kong, and\r\na collection of toy zeppelins suspended from the ceiling. When Gaines is\r\nasked about lawsuits, his eyes sparkle with glee.\r\n\r\n\"We have been sued many times. We've never been beaten. We had two\r\ncases that went to the U.S. Supreme Court. The first was on Alfred E.\r\nNewman (the gap-toothed, moronic-looking character who appears on the\r\nmagazine cover). Two different people claimed it was theirs -- a woman\r\nby the name of Stuff and a man by the name of Schmeck. Neither one\r\nknew about the other one, and we didn't tell them. It was pretty fun when\r\nthey all got to court and found that both of them were claiming to own\r\nAlfred. Through a series of decisions, the Supreme Court decided that\r\nneither one of them owned Alfred, and we were free to use him.\r\n\r\n\"The other case was when Irving Berlin and a number of other\r\nsongwriters sued _Mad_, because we used to publish a lot of articles of\r\nsong parodies which we'd say were sung to the tune of so-and-so. And\r\nthey took umbrage to that. They said that when people would read the\r\nwords, they were singing their music in their heads. The judge ruled that\r\nIrving Berlin did not own iambic pentameter.\"\r\n\r\nThe son of a prominent comic book publisher named M.C. Gaines,\r\nWilliam planned to become a chemistry teacher when he returned to\r\ncollege after World War II. Then his father was killed in an accident, and\r\nGaines decided to enter the comic business himself. \"I started putting out\r\nsome very undistinguished, dreadful stuff, because I didn't know where\r\nI was going. After three years, Albert Feldstein (_Mad's_ editor) joined\r\nme, and we just had a rapport right away. We started putting out stuff that\r\nwe had a feeling for -- science fiction, horror, crime.\"\r\n\r\nThese comics, known as E.C. Publications, are today worth up to $200\r\neach. Classics of their genre, they became the target of a Senate\r\nsubcommittee on juvenile delinquency. Largely because of public pressure,\r\nGaines dropped all of them except _Mad_, which he changed from a 10\r\ncent comic into a 25-cent, more adult magazine. The complete E.C. works\r\nhave recently been reprinted in bound volumes.\r\n\r\nA divorced father of three, Bill Gaines hates exercise, and drives the 18\r\nblocks each day from his Eastside apartment to the _Mad_ office. His\r\nfavorite hobbies are attending wine and food tastings, and visiting Haiti.\r\n\"I've been there about 20 times. It's a wild, untamed place. Something in\r\nmy nature is appealed to by that kind of thing. ... They have no\r\nmaliciousness toward tourists. I was almost shot there twice, but it was by\r\nmistake.\"\r\n\r\nThings are so relaxed around the _Mad_ headquarters that eight out of the\r\nnine full-time staffers have been with the publication for more than 20\r\nyears. \"Our writers and artists are free-lancers,\" says Gaines. \"Most of\r\nthem have been with us 20 years also. ... We get quite a few unsolicited\r\nmanuscripts, but most of them, unfortunately, are not usable. Every once\r\nin a while we'll get one, and then we've got a big day of rejoicing. ...\r\nWe're always looking for writers. We don't need artists, but you _never_\r\nhave enough writers. And we firmly believe that the writer is God,\r\nbecause if you don't have a writer, you don't have movies, you don't have\r\ntelevision, you don't have books, you don't have plays, you don't have\r\nmagazines, you don't have comics -- you don't have anything!\r\n\r\n\"We don't assign articles. The writers come to us with what they want to\r\nwrite, and as long as it's funny, we'll buy it. And we don't care what\r\npoint of view, because _Mad_ has no editorial point of view. We're not\r\nleft, and we're not right. We're all mixed up. And our writers are all\r\nmixed up -- in more ways than one.\"\r\n\r\ndied 6-3-92. born 3-1-22.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER RALPH GINZBURG\r\nPublisher of _Moneysworth_\r\n\r\n7-8-78\r\n\r\nLess than two months ago, the U.S. Supreme Court passed an edict\r\nallowing the police to raid the files of newspaper offices in search of\r\ninformation relating to a crime. \"If they came here, I'd stand at the\r\nentrance and block their way,\" says Ralph Ginzburg, gazing out the\r\nwindow at his suite of offices near Columbus Circle. \"I don't care if they\r\narrest me,\" he adds in his thick Brooklyn accent.\r\n\r\nThe owlish-looking Ginzburg means what he says. He's the publisher of\r\n_Moneysworth_, which is mailed each month to 1.2 million subscribers.\r\nIt is the most successful item he has ever published, but there is no doubt\r\nthat he would risk losing it and going to jail, because Ginzburg has done\r\nso already. In a flamboyant career marked by much notoriety, he has\r\nemerged as one of the most important figures of his generation in\r\nexpanding the freedom of the press.\r\n\r\nOf the six magazines and newspapers that Ginzburg has founded, none has\r\ncaused such a stir as his first one, _Eros_, which lasted from 1962 to\r\n1963. \"It was the first really classy magazine on love and sex in American\r\nhistory,\" he says. \"I signed up 100,000 subscribers right away, at $50 a\r\nyear. Many leading American artists contributed to it. The big difference\r\nis that it was sold entirely through the mails. Our promotion of\r\nsubscriptions through the mail got a lot of complaints.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 35,000 complaints, in fact -- more than the U.S. Post Office had\r\never received up to that time. Ralph Ginzburg was charged with sending\r\nobscene material through the mails, and _Eros_ was forced to suspend\r\npublication while the debate went on. Most Washington lawyers, after\r\nexamining the magazine, concluded that it was not obscene. But the case\r\nbecame a political issue, and in 1972, 10 years after the so-called crime\r\nhad taken place, Ginzburg was ordered to serve an eight-month term at\r\nthe federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. His imprisonment led to\r\na nationwide outcry by intellectuals and public officials.\r\n\r\nNot long after the demise of _Eros_, Ginzburg started another magazine\r\ncalled _Fact_. It, too, ended over a lawsuit. This time the plaintiff was\r\nU.S. Senator Barry Goldwater. He sued the magazine for $2 million on\r\nthe charge of libel, and was awarded $65,000 in damages. \"It was a\r\ncompromise, as jury decisions frequently are,\" remarks Ginzburg.\r\n\"Unfortunately I didn't have very much money back then, and it wiped us\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nDescribing the case, he said: \"In 1964, when Goldwater was running for\r\npresident, he advocated the use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam. I thought\r\nthe guy was out of his mind and I wondered if anyone else had the same\r\nsuspicion. ... We polled all the members of the American Medical\r\nAssociation who were listed as psychiatrists and asked them if they\r\nthought Goldwater was fit to be president. We printed their replies and\r\ntheir long-distance diagnoses ... \"\r\n\r\nBoth the _Eros_ case and the Goldwater case made the American public\r\nexamine some far-reaching questions: What is obscene? What is libelous?\r\nGinzburg helped to establish new definitions for these terms, and in so\r\ndoing, widened the power of the press.\r\n\r\n_Avant-Garde_, his third publication, existed from 1967 to 1970. \"It was\r\nborn during the Vietnam uprising in this country,\" he explains. \"It was a\r\nmagazine of art and politics, and had no ad revenue.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year that _Avant-Garde_ folded, he began a newsletter called\r\n_Moneysworth_. Soon it expanded into a full-sized newspaper. \"It was\r\nlaunched,\" says Ginzburg, \"because we felt that the only existing\r\nperiodical in the area of consumer interest -- _Consumer Reports_ --\r\nwasn't broad enough. Spending money is more than buying appliances.\"\r\n\r\nWhile _Moneysworth_ does carry many valuable tips on personal finance,\r\nit also has a considerable amount of sensationalism that would seem at\r\nhome in the _National Enquirer_. Even so, Ginzburg's managerial skills,\r\nhis nonstop working habits, and his literary expertise -- he has written\r\nseveral books -- have made _Moneysworth_ a winner. Using the same\r\nstaff of 40, along with many free-lance writers, he now publishes two\r\nother monthly newspapers as well, _American Business_ and Extra!\r\n\r\nHe has been a Westsider for 15 years, and his publishing company,\r\nAvant-Garde Media, is located on West 57th Street.\r\n\r\nIf Ginzburg has a single goal right now, it's \"to saved up enough money\r\nto enable me to put out a periodical exactly like _Avant-Garde_ was. It\r\nwas pure pleasure for me: there was no commercial compromise. But\r\neven though this is a multimillion-dollar corporation here, I can't afford\r\nit at the moment. ... Money is important in publishing. I have to spend 99\r\npercent of my time and effort chasing the buck. I guess I'm lucky. Most\r\npeople spend 100 percent of their time that way.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER LILLIAN GISH\r\n78 years in show business\r\n\r\n1-5-80\r\n\r\nD.W. Griffith, the father of motion pictures, used to say there were only\r\ntwo people who outworked him -- Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish.\r\nPickford, who died last May, made her final film in 1933. But Lillian\r\nGish never got around to retiring. At 83, she is perhaps the most active\r\nliving legend in America.\r\n\r\nSipping tea at her Eastside apartment, which is decorated like a Victorian\r\ndrawing room, Gish appears to have defeated time. Her clear blue eyes,\r\nporcelain-smooth complexion, and slender, girlish figure have not changed\r\nall that much since she rose to international stardom in Griffith's\r\ncontroversial 1915 classic, _The Birth of a Nation_. She also starred in his\r\n1916 film _Intolerance_, a box office failure when released, but later\r\nrecognized as a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nAn animated speaker who makes sweeping gestures, she still has the\r\ncrystalline voice and flawless enunciation that enabled her to make the\r\ntransition from silent films to talkies and Broadway shows in the early\r\n1930s. The 1978 Robert Altman film _A Wedding_ marked her 100th\r\nscreen appearance.\r\n\r\n\"I've never worked harder in my life than I have in the last three or four\r\nyears,\" says Miss Gish, who, during that period has made her singing and\r\ndancing debut in Washington's Kennedy Center, hosted a 13-week series\r\nfor public television, _The Silent Years_, appeared in an ABC-TV movie\r\nof the week, and toured the world three times to present a one-woman\r\nshow that combines film clips with narration. Her autobiography, _The\r\nMovies, Mr. Griffith and Me_, has been translated into 13 languages.\r\n\r\n\"I dedicated the book to my mother, who gave me love; to my sister, who\r\ntaught me to laugh; to my father, who gave me insecurity; and to Mr.\r\nGriffith, who taught me that it was more fun to work than to play,\" she\r\nrecalls with merriment, describing how her mother wound up in the\r\ntheatre around 1901 due to financial need. Five-year-old Lillian and her\r\n4-year-old sister Dorothy soon followed in the business. \"We didn't use\r\nour real names because we didn't want to disgrace the family. ... They\r\nused to have signs on hotels: 'No actors or dogs allowed.'\"\r\n\r\nShe never got a chance to attend school. \"I loved the book _Black\r\nBeauty_, and everybody would read it to me on the train or waiting for\r\nthe train. Well, I finally had it read to me so much, I knew it by heart.\r\nAnd that's how I learned to read. When we were travelling around,\r\nmother would always take her history book. When we were in historical\r\nplaces, she'd take us to where history happened.\"\r\n\r\nAt the height of her silent film career, Lillian received 15,000 fan letters\r\na week, many from overseas. \"Silent films are the universal language that\r\nthe Bible predicted would bring about the millennium. ... When Mr.\r\nGriffith made his first talking picture in 1921, he said, 'This is committing\r\nsuicide. My pictures play to the world. Five percent of them speak\r\nEnglish. Why should I lose 95 percent of my audience?'\r\n\r\n\"One of the things I'm trying to do now is to bring back silent films and\r\nbeautiful music. I'm doing it with my film _La Boheme_, which was\r\nmade in 1926. I've done it in the opera house in Chicago with an organist,\r\nand at Town Hall here. Harold Schonberg of the _New York Times_ gave\r\nit the most ecstatic review.\"\r\n\r\nHer credits include an honorary Oscar award, dozens of major stage roles,\r\nand a movie that she co-wrote and directed. But Miss Gish, with\r\ncharacteristic modesty, prefers to talk about her friends and family.\r\nBitterness and complaint are alien to her nature, although life has not\r\nalways been easy. She never married, and her mother, to whom she was\r\nhighly devoted, spent the last 25 years of her life as an invalid. \"But she\r\nwas never unhappy,\" testifies Lillian. \"She was always the first to laugh,\r\nand the gayest.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing her mother's death in 1948, the apartment was given to Dokey,\r\nher nurse, who died the following year. Then Lillian and Dorothy Gish\r\nshared the apartment until Dorothy's death in 1968. Although Lillian now\r\nlives alone, she has no opportunity to be lonely. Besides work, travel, and\r\nreading -- her favorite activities -- she has 13 godchildren.\r\n\r\nOne thing that helps keep her young, says Miss Gish, is her intense\r\ncuriosity. \"I was born with it, thank heavens. I feel sorry for people who\r\nsay they're bored. How in the world can anyone be bored in the world\r\ntoday? How can fiction complete with what's going on?\"\r\n\r\nA few of her films, have been lost forever, since no original prints exist\r\nin good condition. Most, however, are still shown around the globe,\r\nwhich explains why her autobiography is available in such languages as\r\nBurmese and East Malaysian. The Museum of Modern Art on West 53rd\r\nStreet has one of the country's finest collections of vintage Gish films.\r\n\r\nOne of her upcoming projects is a movie based on a story by the Danish\r\nwriter Isak Dinesen, scheduled to begin shooting in Europe this winter.\r\nAnother is a television pilot to be shot in California for Julius Evans.\r\n\r\nAsked to name some of the things she is most curious about today, Miss\r\nGish quickly replies, \"Naturally what's happening in Cambodia -- how\r\nthey're going to solve that problem. Those poor children. It breaks my\r\nheart. ... And who's going to be our next president. We've come to the\r\npoint where we should have two presidents, I think -- someone to look\r\nafter the world and somebody to look after us.\"\r\n\r\ndied of natural causes 2-27-93.\r\nborn 10-14-1893\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MILTON GLASER\r\nDesign director of the new _Esquire_\r\n\r\n2-11-78\r\n\r\nTwo decades before _Playboy_ first hit the newsstands, there was only\r\none men's magazine in America. A generation of schoolchildren grew up\r\nspeaking its name in hushed whispers, though anyone reexamining those\r\nearly issues today could hardly understand why. The magazine was\r\n_Esquire_.\r\n\r\nIts popularity has dipped somewhat in recent years, but _Esquire_ still\r\nsells one million copies per month. And it still has the reputation of being\r\nthe most tasteful, literary, and sophisticated publication for the American\r\nmale. If some people have complained that it has not kept up with the\r\ntimes, they won't be able to say that any longer -- not since _Esquire_\r\nbecame the property of Clay Felker and Milton Glaser, the publishing\r\nteam who made _New York_ magazine into one of the best-selling\r\nweeklies in the city.\r\n\r\nWith Felker as editor and Glaser as design director, _Esquire_ will have\r\na totally new look starting with the February 14 issue. It will have a\r\ndifferent size, binding, shape, length, and contents. It will also change its\r\nname to _Esquire Fortnightly_ and appear 26 times a year instead of 12.\r\n\r\n\"The new _Esquire_ will be ungimmicky, easy to understand,\" says\r\nMilton Glaser, taking a half-hour break from his numerous artistic\r\nprojects. He is as animated as his enlarged signature, which glows from\r\na custom-made neon lamp on the wall beside a Renaissance Madonna and\r\na framed Islamic drawing.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you notice about Glaser is the colored handkerchief\r\nadorning his jacket pocket. Then you notice how relaxed he is, and how\r\neasily he smiles.\r\n\r\n\"The name of the game is to get an audience that identifies with the\r\nmagazine and feels it's on their side. People buy a magazine because it's\r\nof considerable interest to them, not because they get a deal on the\r\nsubscription. ... What you want to do is to find the right-size audience,\r\nmade up of people who believe in the values that the magazine reflects.\"\r\n\r\nThe original _Esquire_, Glaser points out, helped to glamorize the rich,\r\nprivileged man of the world -- the man who had arrived, who knew his\r\nplace in the world, and whose greatest desire was to surround himself\r\nwith the symbols of wealth, such as fancy cars and beautiful women.\r\n\r\nToday, says Glaser, the American male no longer measures success by\r\nsymbols alone. Rather, he aims for self-development, for the richness of\r\nlife itself -- professional, personal, physical, intellectual and spiritual.\r\n\r\nClay Felker writes, in a yet-unreleased editorial in _Esquire_: \"We will\r\nexplore how a man can develop a more rewarding life with the women\r\nand children in his life. ... I see _Esquire_ magazine as a cheery, book\r\nfilled, comfortable den, a place of wit and sparkling conversation, of\r\ngoodwill and genial intelligence, where thoughtful discussions take place\r\nand wise conclusions are reached.\"\r\n\r\nMilton Glaser is probably the best-qualified artist in America to redesign\r\n_Esquire_. Besides his success with _New York_ magazine, which began\r\nas a Sunday supplement to the old _New York Herald Tribune_, Glaser\r\nhas designed _The Village Voice_, _Circus_ magazine, _New West_ and\r\ntwo of France's leading publications, _L'Express_ and _Paris-Match_.\r\n\r\nGlaser's posters have sold in the millions. He has put on one-man\r\nexhibitions in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East. (He believes, in fact,\r\nthat his work is more appreciated abroad than at home). He has designed\r\neverything from stores to toys to new typefaces.\r\n\r\nHe is a faculty member at both Cooper Union and the School of Visual\r\nArts. He is responsible for all the graphic design and decorative programs\r\nat the World Trade Center. Two volumes of his works have been\r\npublished -- _Milton Glaser: Graphic Arts_ and _The Milton Glaser Poster\r\nBook_.\r\n\r\nIn addition, he is a noted food critic. For the past 10 years he has co\r\nauthored and constantly updated the best-selling Manhattan restaurant\r\nguide, _The Underground Gourmet_.\r\n\r\nA native New Yorker, Milton Glaser has fond memories of his boyhood\r\nin the Bronx. He especially likes recalling an event that took place in 1933\r\n-- the year that _Esquire_ was founded.\r\n\r\n\"When I was 4 years old, a cousin of mine said, 'Would you like to see\r\na pigeon?' He had a paper bag with him and I thought he meant there was\r\na pigeon in it. But then he took out a pencil and drew a picture of a bird.\r\nI was so astonished that you could invent reality that I never recovered\r\nfrom it. The only thing I wanted to do in my life was to make images.\"\r\n\r\nMilton and his wife, Shirley, moved to the West Side last August. \"I\r\nguess it was the opportunity to find the right physical space. I like the\r\nneighborhood because of the mix of working class, middle class, and\r\nupper class. ... That really is the richest thing the urban scene offers.\"\r\nThe number of Westside restaurants listed in _The Underground Gourmet_\r\nhas sharply increased over the years. Among his favorite dining spots of\r\nall price ranges are Ying's on Columbus Avenue (at 70th St.), the Cafe\r\ndes Artistes (1 West 67th St.), and the Harbin Inn (2637 Broadway).\r\n\r\nLook in any New York subway station and you'll see a poster advertising\r\nthe School of Visual Arts. It shows two identical men in a room. One is\r\nlying on a bed and the other is floating in the air. The caption reads:\r\n\"Having a talent isn't worth much unless you know what to do with it.\"\r\nMilton Glaser, the designer of that poster, is a supreme example of a man\r\nwith many talents who knows what to do with all of them.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER PAUL GOLDBERGER\r\nArchitecture critic for the _New York Times_\r\n\r\n12-3-77\r\n\r\n\"What is architecture? It's the whole built environment. It's the outside of\r\na building, the inside, the function; it serves social needs, physical needs.\r\n... And a building has an obligation to work well with the buildings\r\naround it -- at least in the city.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker is Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for the _New York\r\nTimes_. His immaculate suit and tie, refined manners, dry wit, and\r\nsomewhat formal way of speaking seem to mark him a Timesman even\r\nmore than the carefully researched, colorfully written articles that have\r\npoured out of his pen in the last four years.\r\n\r\nAs a critic, Goldberger is accustomed to vocalizing opinions and facts in\r\nequal measure. His open-mindedness on architectural styles is\r\ndemonstrated by his apartment, a lavish, ultramodernized suite of high\r\nceilinged rooms inside one of the oldest buildings on Central Park West.\r\nThe interview begins with a trick question: \"What is the third tallest\r\nbuilding in New York?\" (Answer: the Empire State Building.) He fields\r\nit without cracking a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I guess the question is, do you consider the World Trade Center two\r\nbuildings?\" he says. \"I guess it's like asking whether Grover Cleveland\r\nwas two presidents or one because he served two non-consecutive terms.\r\n... The World Trade Center was not necessary built functionally or very\r\npleasing aesthetically. It was built as a kind of symbol of power by the\r\nPort Authority. I'm used to it now; human beings can adapt to anything.\r\nI even like going to the restaurant at the top and the restaurant at the\r\nbottom. It's the floors in the middle I don't like.\"\r\n\r\nHe points to the new Citicorp Center on East 53rd Street as an example\r\nof modern architecture at its best, and the mosquelike Cultural Center at\r\nColumbus Circle as an example of the opposite. \"It's pretty horrible,\"\r\nsays the critic, agreeing with a newspaper writer who recently labeled the\r\nCultural Center one of the 12 ugliest buildings in Manhattan. \"It's a very\r\nsilly building; it's so obviously dumb. But it doesn't particularly bother\r\nme. It's almost innocent, it's so silly.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln Center, too, draws his barbs. \"I find it very pretentious. Rather\r\nboring, really. It's a set of imitations of classical themes. The buildings\r\nare an unfortunate compromise because the builders were afraid to build\r\nsomething really modern, or to design something that really looked like\r\na classical building. ... There's a feeling that they sort of want to be\r\nmodern and sort of want to be classical and end up being a very\r\nunsatisfying compromise.\"\r\n\r\nA New Jersey native who developed a passion for architecture in his\r\nearliest years, Paul Goldberger attended Yale University and then worked\r\nas a general reporter for another newspaper. Several years later he became\r\nan editorial assistant for the _Times_. In 1973 there came an opening for\r\nan architectural writer, and because the _Times_ knew of his background,\r\nGoldberger was given the first shot at the job. \"It was fabulous,\" he\r\nrecalls, because it was what I always wanted to do. And it was very much\r\na matter of luck -- of being at the right place at the right time.\" His\r\narticles appear most often in the daily _Times_; Louise Huxtable remains\r\nthe chief architectural writer for the Sunday paper.\r\n\r\nWhy would a sophisticated Timesman choose the West Side over the East?\r\n\"There are many more wonderful buildings on the West Side,\" says\r\nGoldberger. Unfortunately not many of the buildings on the West Side\r\nhave been kept up as well as the East Side. ... In terms of apartment\r\nhouse architecture, Central Park West is probably the best street in New\r\nYork. It has all the grandeur and beauty and monumentality of Fifth\r\nAvenue and it also has the relaxed atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nThere's not one West Side,\" he continues. \"There's at least 10. Around\r\nhere is one neighborhood. Riverside Drive is another. Up by Columbia is\r\nanother. ... One of the reasons I like my own neighborhood is because\r\nthough it is very much West Side, it's handy to the East Side and\r\nmidtown. I walk through the park all the time.\"\r\n\r\nAny chance that Manhattan's skyscrapers will eventually weigh down the\r\nisland? \"No,\" replies the critic emphatically. \"First, the island is very,\r\nvery solid rock and nothing could cause it to sink. The other factor,\r\nespecially today, is that buildings are not all that heavy, because they're\r\nbeing built with lighter materials and more modern engineering methods.\r\nSo a huge new building like the Citicorp, which is 900 feet high, is not\r\nany heavier than a building 500 feet high built 30 years ago. And since we\r\ndon't have earthquakes, this is probably the safest environment in the\r\nworld to build a skyscraper.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough studying and writing about architecture is \"more than a full-time\r\njob,\" Goldberger manages to keep abreast of the legal aspects of buildings\r\nas well, including tenants' rights, rent control, zoning laws and redlining.\r\nThe New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is another of his\r\ninterests. \"I think landmarking is crucial to the city,\" he testifies. \"A city\r\nexists in time as much as space. It's the mixture of new and old buildings\r\nthat gives the city life and vitality.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER MILTON GOLDMAN\r\nBroadway's super agent\r\n\r\n4-14-79\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me -- just one more call to make,\" said Milton Goldman, pushing\r\nthe buttons on his nearest desk phone. \"Go on, you can ask me questions\r\nat the same time,\" he added, holding the receiver to his ear.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the biggest theatrical agent in the world?\" I said. He returned\r\nmy gaze evenly.\r\n\r\n\"Others have said it. It would be immodest for me to say it -- but I\r\nprobably am,\" said Goldman, who by this time had reached his party and\r\nwas inviting the young actress on the other end to a Broadway opening\r\nthat night. He chatted with her for several minutes, his Jack Bennyish\r\nvoice breaking occasionally into rich laughter.\r\n\r\nSitting upright behind a desk-sized table covered with papers, folders,\r\nnotebooks and play scripts, the ruddy-complexioned, jacketless Goldman\r\nlooked far more relaxed that I had expected of a man who, in his 32 years\r\nas an agent, has handled the careers of close to 5,000 actors and actresses.\r\nAmong those he has helped \"discover\" are Jack Lemmon, Walter\r\nMatthau, Grace Kelly, Lee Marvin, Charlton Heston and Faye Dunaway.\r\nAnd though Goldman has become a celebrity in his own right, he still\r\nexudes the low-keyed charm of a friendly neighbor talking over a fence.\r\n\r\nThe appearance is no deception: he owes his success not to high-pressure\r\ntactics, but to an encyclopedic knowledge of the theatre on both sides of\r\nthe Atlantic, a keen judgment of which shows are best for his clients, and\r\na long-proven record for trustworthiness. By title, he is vice president in\r\ncharge of the theatrical division of International Creative Management,\r\nwhich is matched in size only by the William Morris Agency.\r\nUnofficially, he serves as father confessor, rabbi, psychiatrist, and best\r\nfriend to many of the top stars he represents. Attending the theatre up to\r\nfive times a week, he is always on the lookout for new clients. His\r\nweekends are devoted to reading and casting new plays.\r\n\r\n\"I can't resist talent, and when I see a talented young actor or actress, I\r\nwant very much to help realize their potential by opening as many doors\r\nas I can for them,\" he explained, gripping the arms of his chair. \"I don't\r\nthink of my job as work. For me, it's fun. And I never know where the\r\none begins and the other ends. Because I'm that lucky individual whose\r\nprivate life and public life are one and the same thing.\"\r\n\r\nEvery year he takes a vacation to Europe on the Queen Elizabeth II. \"I'm\r\nin Paris for a week and London for about three weeks.\" In slow, carefully\r\nchosen sentences, he stated, \"I represent many English clients because my\r\nknowledge of the English theatre is probably better than anyone else in the\r\nAmerican theatre. Every year in London, I get the same suite in the Savoy\r\nHotel and give great parties. I go to at least eight plays a week --\r\nsometimes as many as 10. So I get to see all the plays in London. And I\r\nknow all the English actors and they know me.\" Among his British\r\nclients: Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir John Gielgud.\r\n\r\n\"American performers excel in the musical comedy theatre, where dancers\r\nand singers also very often are fine actors. This is not true in England.\r\nDancers are especially hard to cast in London, though I think that is\r\nchanging now. ... It's sad that the American theatre can't support serious\r\nplays. They're either musicals or they're comedies. I think a healthy\r\ntheatre should be able to support the works of serious playwrights. This\r\nseason, we happen to have on Broadway an important play by an\r\nAmerican playwright -- Arthur Kopit's _Wings_, which stars our client\r\nConstance Cummings, who is an American actress who went to England\r\nand made her reputation abroad, and has now returned here to great\r\nacclaim.\"\r\n\r\nA native of New Brunswick, New Jersey, Goldman witnessed his first\r\nBroadway show in the summer of 1929, and from that day forward, the\r\ntheatre was his passion. For 10 years he worked as a tire salesman at a\r\nfamily-owned business. Then, through his friend Arnold Weissberger, a\r\nnoted lawyer, Goldman was offered a job as a theatrical agent at no base\r\nsalary, but with a $25 weekly expense account and a 25 percent interest\r\nin any clients he signed up. Success came to him almost at once.\r\n\r\nA lifelong bachelor, Goldman today shares an apartment with Weissberger\r\non the Upper East Side. His favorite local restaurant is the Four Seasons.\r\n\"I go there all the time for lunch; that's my main meal of the day. I think\r\nit's the best restaurant in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe actor's life, he believes, \"is a sad and a difficult one. Every time you\r\nget a good part, the next part has to be bigger -- more money. As you\r\nreach the top, it becomes tougher and tougher to get those parts.\"\r\nNevertheless, Goldman does not find his own job at all frustrating.\r\n\r\n\"Pressures? Yes, there are many pressures. But I have said this before:\r\nthere are so many rewards for me when I see a client in whom I believe\r\nget a great break in the theatre or films of television. It's a source of great\r\nsatisfaction. And with the number of clients I represent, each day brings\r\nsome rewards. That's why I've often said to clients: 'I have many lives\r\nto live.'\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER TAMMY GRIMES\r\nStar of _Father's Day_ at the American Place Theatre\r\n\r\n6-23-79\r\n\r\nTammy Grimes is one of the few Broadway stars to have received Tony\r\nAwards in two categories -- for best Musical Comedy Actress in _The\r\nUnsinkable Molly Brown_ (1961), and for Best Dramatic Actress in Noel\r\nCoward's _Private Lives_ (1969). In a sense, she is Molly Brown\r\npersonified -- a powerful stage presence whose charm, beauty, and pure\r\ntalent make her shine in every production she takes part in, regardless of\r\nthe overall merit of the show itself.\r\n\r\nHer disappointments have been, at times, as spectacular as her triumphs.\r\nFor example, there was her shot at network television in the early 1960s,\r\n_The Tammy Grimes Show_, which lasted only 11 episodes because, she\r\nsays, \"the writing, the concept, and the talent never really got together.\r\nAnd I blame myself for that. Because if your name's up there, you are\r\nresponsible for the product.\"\r\n\r\nHer marriage to actor Christopher Plummer ended in divorce after four\r\nyears, but had the happy result of producing a daughter, Amanda\r\nPlummer, who is now a successful actress herself.\r\n\r\nTammy played Molly Brown on Broadway for the show's entire two-year\r\nrun, but the movie role went to Debbie Reynolds. She got some rave\r\nreviews for her acting in a Broadway thriller named _Trick_ this year, but\r\nthe show closed within weeks. When that happened, she quickly started\r\nworking on a new show, _Father's Day_ by Oliver Hailey, that is\r\nscheduled to open on June 21 at the American Place Theatre on West 46th\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\"It's about three women who get together on Father's Day,\" says Miss\r\nGrimes in an interview at her Upper East Side apartment. \"They live in\r\nthe same building, and they're divorced. It shows how the three of them\r\nare coping with the situation. My feeling is that they don't want to be\r\ndivorced. It's a very well-written play -- a comedy. ... It's at the same\r\ntheatre where _In Cold Storage_ started.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview takes place in her softly decorated bedroom looking out on\r\na garden. Tammy is propped up on pillows beneath the covers, smoking\r\na cigarette and sipping a bottle of Tab as she apologizes for her condition.\r\n\"It may have been the caviar I had last night,\" she says, cheerful in spite\r\nof her discomfort. Her pixyish features expand easily into a grin, and at\r\n45 she has lost none of the childlike playfulness that first propelled her to\r\nstardom. But the most surprising quality about Tammy Grimes is her\r\nthroaty British accent. Although she has done little work in England, her\r\nnormal speaking voice is far more British than American -- a fact which,\r\nfor some reason, she strenuously denies. \"I spent a lot of time doing\r\nBritish comedy,\" she explains, \"but I don't sound British!\"\r\n\r\nA native of Lynn, Massachusetts -- \"I just happened to be born on the\r\nway home from a party\" -- she grew up in Boston and decided early to\r\nbecome an actress. When she was 16, Thornton Wilder saw her in a\r\nproduction of his classic play, _The Skin of Our Teeth_. He declared:\r\n\"Young lady, even Tallulah Bankhead didn't do the things you did to the\r\nrole.\" By her early 20s she was performing in numerous Off Broadway\r\nshows. A singing act she developed for one of New York's leading supper\r\nclubs won her a rave review in _Life_ magazine, and shortly after her\r\n25th birthday, she received her first starring role on Broadway, in an ill\r\nfated Noel Coward production called _Look After Lulu_.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1960, saw _The Unsinkable Molly Brown_ reach\r\nBroadway. It was the most expensive musical ever mounted until then,\r\nand became a smash. Tammy played the role 1,800 times; she missed only\r\n13 performances. \"I believe that if you can speak, you should be up\r\nthere,\" she says. \"Even today, people will stop me and say, 'We came in\r\nfrom North Carolina to see you, and when we got to the theatre, you\r\nweren't there.'\"\r\n\r\nAs a television performer, she has appeared as a guest star in dozens of\r\ndramatic series, situation comedies, and variety shows. She has played\r\nnumerous Shakespearean roles, made five movies, done a great deal of\r\nradio work, and recorded numerous albums, including several for\r\nchildren. An animal lover, she gives her time freely to such groups as the\r\nAmerican Horse Protection Association and Friends of the Animals.\r\n\r\nTammy has been at her present East Side address since 1969. Though she\r\nlikes to cook, she also frequents many restaurants including Veau d'Or\r\nand Gino's.\r\n\r\nAsked to evaluate her career as a whole, Tammy notes that all but one of\r\nthe shows she has done \"seemed to open and close in a natural way.\r\nThere's always a reason why a play ends prematurely. ... It's nice to\r\nplease the public, but you can't constantly be thinking that they will accept\r\nthis but not something else from you. You have to go by your feelings.\r\nIf something is good, the public will go to see it.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER DELORES HALL\r\nStar of _Your Arms Too Short to Box with God_\r\n\r\n5-21-77\r\n\r\nIt's just after 10 on a Wednesday evening when Delores Hall steps out of\r\nthe Lyceum Theatre's stage door onto 46th Street. At least 20 fans are\r\nwaiting; they give a cheer as she emerges and rush toward her. Delores\r\nHall smiles broadly as she autographs their programs, for these fans are\r\nhers. She has worked hard to become a Broadway star, and now in _Your\r\nArms Too Short to Box with God_ she is precisely that.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not really tired,\" says Ms. Hall a few minutes later over a snack\r\nat the All-State Cafe. \"I'm still at a peak of energy from the show. That\r\nwas my second performance today, but I could do another one if I had\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\nAsking Delores about her earlier days brings a flood of memories and\r\nlaughter. She's a happy, bouncy woman and seems as pleased to talk as\r\nany friendly neighbor. \"When I was 3 I discovered I had vibrato,\" she\r\nrecalls. \"My mother taught me everything I know about singing. I can\r\nremember her hitting me in the stomach, showing me how to breathe. But\r\nwhatever she did, she did it right. I was 4 when I first sang in public; they\r\nstood me on a table. I can remember some people throwing 50-cent\r\npieces.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Kansas City slightly more than 30 years ago, Delores grew up\r\nwith music in her ears. Her father played the bass for Count Basie, and\r\nher mother was -- and still is -- a missionary in the Church of God in\r\nChrist, which produces gospel singers the way southern universities raise\r\nfootball players. Young Delores began singing regularly at the church\r\nservices -- an activity she continued when her family moved to Los\r\nAngeles. When Delores entered college she formed her own gospel group,\r\nan act so popular that she soon left school to become a full-time musician.\r\nLater, Harry Belafonte invited the Delores Hall Singers to tour with him\r\nfor six months.\r\n\r\n\"Harry is a beautiful man,\" Delores grins. \"He came to the show a month\r\nor so ago, and afterwards he went backstage and somebody introduced us.\r\nHe said, 'Miss Hall, I've heard so much about you,' and then he\r\nscreamed, and we jumped into each other's arms.\r\n\r\nDelores has lived in New York since 1969. Five years ago she moved to\r\nthe West Side. \"People are so much warmer here,\" she says. Her\r\nremarkable singing has won her parts in half a dozen Broadway shows,\r\nbut with _Box_, for the first time, she suddenly found herself the star of\r\na hit production. Clive Barnes, in a highly positive review in the _New\r\nYork Times_, declares: \"Miss Hall has the audience in the palm of her\r\nvoice.\" The all-black cast of this musical adaptation of the Book of\r\nMatthew has been packing the Lyceum since Christmas, and advance\r\nticket sales go to October.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Ms. Hall's unbroken musical success, her life has not been\r\nwithout personal tragedy. Just before the Broadway premiere of _Box_\r\nlast December 22, she suffered the heartbreaking loss of her only brother,\r\na minister. \"It was very hard to open the show,\" she recalls, \"but I got\r\nthrough it with the help of God.\"\r\n\r\nDelores lives on West 72nd Street with her husband of seven years,\r\nMichael Goodstone. Whenever she can, Delores joins Michael at temple\r\nin Westchester County: \"I find it very uplifting spiritually, because I\r\nbelieve God is everywhere.\" Each Sunday the couple both attend the\r\nChurch of God in Christ. \"Some people call it the Holy Roller church,\"\r\nshe explains. \"After the service, we go downstairs for a piece of the best\r\nfried chicken.\"\r\n\r\nMs. Hall's face glows with pride when she speaks of Deardra, her 14\r\nyear-old daughter from a previous marriage: \"My daughter is a singer,\r\ntoo. She won the music award from her school.\" Deardra is hoping to\r\nenter New York's High School of Performing Arts this fall.\r\n\r\nPlans for the future? Delores would like to try grand opera someday --\r\npossibly the role of Aida. And a new record album is not far off. Several\r\nyears ago she recorded her first album for RCA. Since she began drawing\r\nnational attention in _Box_, some tempting offers have come in from\r\nrecording companies, and her manager is in the process of negotiating a\r\ncontract. The new album may be either gospel or middle of the road: \"I'm\r\npraying very hard, so it depends on what the Lord says.\"\r\n\r\nBut for the moment, Delores Hall is well satisfied at filling the Lyceum\r\nTheatre seven times each week. \"This show I love so much,\" she says,\r\nher eyes sparkling, \"because it takes me home.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LIONEL HAMPTON\r\nKing of the Newport Jazz Festival\r\n\r\n6-24-78\r\n\r\nThe world's greatest celebration of jazz, the Newport Jazz Festival, will\r\nget off the ground on June 23 -- its 25th consecutive year. During the 12\r\nday festival, in indoor and outdoor settings all over Manhattan and\r\nbeyond, the most important names in jazz will stage nearly 30 major\r\nmusical events.\r\n\r\nMore than half the concerts, appropriately enough, will take place on the\r\nWest Side, in Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall. And just as\r\nappropriately, this year's festival will be dedicated to a Westsider whose\r\nlife has been an inspiration to millions of people, not only for the great\r\nmusic he has created, but for a heart as large as the Grand Canyon. To\r\ncall him merely a giant of jazz could be an understatement, because they\r\ndon't come any bigger than Lionel Hampton.\r\n\r\nAsk a dozen people what the name Lionel Hampton means to them and\r\nyou're likely to get a dozen answers -- all of them correct. In his 50 years\r\nas a professional musician, \"Hamp\" has used his remarkable gifts humbly,\r\nwisely, and unselfishly.\r\n\r\nMusic historians will always remember him as the man who introduced\r\nthe vibraphone into jazz. This he accomplished in 1930, while playing\r\nwith Louis Armstrong. Ever since, Hampton has been known as the\r\nworld's foremost master of the instrument. He is also a leading drummer,\r\npianist, singer, arranger, bandleader and composer. At 69, he continues\r\nto work nearly 50 weeks out of the year, taking his band to every corner\r\nof the U.S. and Europe. But whether he's making a live recording in a\r\nnightclub or performing his own symphonic works with the Boston\r\nSymphony Orchestra, Lionel Hampton glows with a spiritual energy that\r\nextends far beyond his music.\r\n\r\nIt's 2 o'clock in the afternoon when I arrive at Hampton's neat, modern\r\napartment overlooking Lincoln Center. I sit on the sofa talking with Chuck\r\nJones, his public relations man, and a few minutes later Hampton emerges\r\nfrom the bedroom and plops down on the sofa beside me, wearing a\r\ndressing gown, slippers, and the famous smile that no one can imitate.\r\nAfter the introductions, I ask about his most recent concerts.\r\n\r\n\"I'm still trying to get myself together,\" he says almost apologetically in\r\nhis rich Southern drawl. \"We just got back from a six-week tour in\r\nEurope. We played all over Scandinavia, Germany, Southern France.\r\n\r\n\"When I was in Chicago this week, at the Playboy Cub, they gave me a\r\nnew set of drums, with lights inside. I push a button and the whole drum\r\nlights up. I'm going to use them for Newport. This is the latest thing. It\r\nwill blow their minds. We open on July first in Carnegie Hall and I'm\r\nbringing back a lot of veterans from my band.\"\r\n\r\nHe grew up in Chicago, but because of the gang fights in his\r\nneighborhood, Lionel's grandmother sent him to a Catholic school in\r\nWisconsin. There a nun taught him to play the drums. The youngster\r\nlearned fast; when he was 15, he made up his mind to head for the West\r\nCoast on his own, to pursue a jazz career. At the train station, he\r\npromised his grandmother that he would say his prayers and read the Bible\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nSome 15 years later, Hampton was invited to join the Benny Goodman\r\nband in New York. His acceptance of the offer had great social\r\nsignificance, for it was the first time that blacks and whites played\r\ntogether in a major musical group.\r\n\r\n>From 1937 to 1971 he lived in central Harlem. Then, after moving to the\r\nWest Side, Hampton decided that he wanted to help upgrade his old\r\nneighborhood, so, on the advice of Governor Nelson Rockefeller, he\r\nraised $1 million in seed money and filed an application with the Urban\r\nDevelopment Corporation for some new housing. Today there are 355\r\nfamilies living in the Lionel Hampton Houses at 130th Street and 8th\r\nAvenue.\" I was just designated the land right next to it,\" he says proudly.\r\n\"We're going to break ground next year. It will be 250 family units,\r\ndedicated to my late wife Gladys. The Gladys Hampton Building.\"\r\n\r\nA friend of many important public figures, Hampton has never lost his\r\naffection for Richard Nixon: \"When I was a kid in California, President\r\nNixon was our congressman. Then he became our senator. He was a good\r\nman and a good politician. He helped the blacks a lot; he helped the\r\nSpanish. I campaigned for him when he ran for president. ... What\r\nhappened with Watergate, I don't know. That's high politics. But I know\r\nI always had high esteem for him.\"\r\n\r\nIn a political campaign last year, Hampton threw his support behind\r\nErnest Morial, a black man who was running for mayor of New Orleans.\r\nBefore Hampton stepped in, Morial was sixth in the polls. \"I sent my P.R.\r\nman Chuck Jones down there to put some life into his campaign. Chuck\r\nput a thousand placards all over town and went on all the radio stations,\r\nand I played at a Morial for Mayor music festival. He came in first in the\r\nprimary and then he won the election.\"\r\n\r\nMy questions are finished. I get up and shake Lionel's hand, telling him\r\nthat I've always loved his music. He dashes into his bedroom, bringing\r\nout four records for me to take home. He shakes my hand twice more.\r\n\r\nOn my way to the door, I ask him one last question: Does he still have\r\ntime to read the Bible every day?\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replies, grinning, \"That's what I was doing when you came\r\nhere and that's what I'm going to do after you leave.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER DAVID HAWK\r\nExecutive director of Amnesty International U.S.A.\r\n\r\n3-11-78\r\n\r\nDuring the final days of World War II, a captured resistance member sat\r\nalone in a black prison cell, tired, hungry, tortured, and convinced of\r\napproaching death. After weeks of torment, the prisoner was sure that\r\nthere was no hope, that no one knew or cared. But in the middle of the\r\nnight, the door of the cell opened, and the jailer, shouting abuse into the\r\ndarkness, threw a loaf of bread onto the dirt floor. The prisoner, by this\r\ntime ravenous, tore open the loaf.\r\n\r\nInside was a matchbox. Inside the matchbox were matches and a scrap of\r\npaper. The prisoner lit a match. On the paper was a single word:\r\n\"Coraggio!\" Courage. Take courage. Don't give up, don't give in. We are\r\ntrying to help you. \"Coraggio!\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner never did find out who wrote the one-word message, but the\r\nspark of hope it provided may well have saved his life. The story is told\r\nin _Matchbox_, the newspaper of Amnesty International U.S.A., one of\r\nthe largest branches of the worldwide human rights organization that\r\nreceived the Nobel Peace Prize for 1977.\r\n\r\nDavid Hawk, executive director of Amnesty international U.S.A., sits\r\nbehind his desk on a weekday morning talking about how the group\r\noriginated and what it has done to earn the prize.\r\n\r\n\"It was started in Britain in 1961 by a lawyer named Peter Benenson,\"\r\nsays Hawk, whose name belies the fact that he has been involved in civil\r\nrights for nearly half of his 34 years. \"It started over a trial that was going\r\non in Portugal.\" Benenson launched a one-year campaign to call attention\r\nto the Portuguese prisoners.\r\n\r\nSoon the idea became so popular that a permanent organization was\r\ncreated. Chapters sprang up in other countries, and members began to\r\nwork toward freeing \"prisoners of conscience\" on every continent. In the\r\npast 17 years, Amnesty International -- or \"Amnesty\" for short -- has\r\naided in securing the release of nearly 13,000 individuals who were\r\nimprisoned not for crimes, but for personal beliefs that went against their\r\ngovernments' official policies.\r\n\r\n\"We're a nuisance factor,\" says Hawk. \"We organize letter-writing and\r\npublicity campaigns on behalf of individual victims of human rights\r\nviolations. It's the letters and the publicity that are Amnesty's tools for\r\nsecuring their release or bettering their conditions while they're in. At\r\nfirst it sounds strange to think that people sitting in living rooms in the\r\nUnited States can help someone in a fortress prison on an island in\r\nIndonesia, or in Siberia. ... You deluge certain people with so many\r\nletters that eventually it becomes an issue. Then the government asks, 'Is\r\nholding this person worth the trouble?' And on occasion, the answer is\r\nno.\"\r\n\r\nThe secret of Amnesty's success is its huge number of volunteers --\r\n170,000 in 78 countries -- who work on the case of a particular prisoner\r\nfor years if necessary. They send letters and telegrams not only to\r\ngovernment officials, but also to the prisoner himself. At times they send\r\npackages, or give financial aid to his family, or arrange for legal aid.\r\n\r\nA 100-member research team in London makes sure that every new case\r\nis thoroughly documented before assigning it to an \"adoption group\" of 12\r\nto 20 people. This group generally receives the names of three prisoners\r\nfrom three different political systems, and meets once a month to work on\r\nthe cases until a result is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Riverside adoption group, dating back to 1966, was the first one\r\nestablished in the U.S. Today there are more than 100 in 32 states. All of\r\nthese are monitored by David Hawk and his staff of 20 full-time workers\r\nat their Westside office. The $750,000 annual U.S. budget comes from\r\nmembers' contributions, foundations, and church agencies.\r\n\r\nHawk assumed the leadership of A.I.-U.S.A. in 1974. \"In the early '60s\r\nI worked in the civil rights movement in the Deep South,\" he recalls.\r\n\"From 1967 to 1972 I was one of the organizers of the Moratorium\r\nAgainst the War. Then I worked in the McGovern campaign.\"\r\n\r\nAt about the same time he graduated from Union Theological Seminary,\r\nand from there went to Oxford University in England, where he found out\r\nabout Amnesty International. Returning to the U.S., he applied for the\r\nvacant post of executive director and was accepted. Ever since then he has\r\nbeen a resident of the West Side. David's wife Joan, a potter, is the editor\r\nof _Matchbox_.\r\n\r\nHawk's biggest concern these days is to focus attention on the human\r\nrights covenants that President Carter has signed and is planning to send\r\nto the U.S. Senate for ratification. The covenants are worded almost the\r\nsame as the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\r\nsigned in December, 1948. \"Put into treaty form,\" explains Hawk, \"the\r\narticles will carry more weight. It's very important for governments to\r\nagree among themselves that they shouldn't torture their citizens, and\r\nshould give them fair trials, and should provide food and housing and\r\neducation for their citizens. Amnesty wants all governments to ratify the\r\ntreaty.\"\r\n\r\nAnyone interest in volunteering some time to this worthy organization\r\nshould write to: Amnesty International, 2112 Broadway, Room 309, New\r\nYork, NY 10023.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER WALTER HOVING\r\nChairman of Tiffany & Company\r\n\r\n12-22-79\r\n\r\nWhen Walter Hoving took over as chairman of Tiffany and Company in\r\n1955, he gave his designers one simple rule: \"Design what you think is\r\nbeautiful and don't worry about selling it.\" The rule applies as much to\r\nstore's eye-catching Christmas display windows as to the three floors of\r\njewelry, silver, china, and crystal at the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th\r\nStreet. Hoving's unique combination of business wizardry and impeccable\r\ntaste has paid off dramatically: since he joined the company, Tiffany's\r\nannual sales haver gone from $7 million to $73 million.\r\n\r\nA tall, soft-spoken, former Brown University football star whose unlined\r\nforehead and vigorous appearance belie his 82 years, Hoving has a voice\r\nlike Jimmy Stewart's and kindly yet authoritative manner. On his\r\nconservative gray suit is a tiny silver pin with the words \"Try God.\"\r\nLeaning back in the comfortable desk chair at his vast, teakwood-paneled\r\noffice at Tiffany's on a recent afternoon, he answers all questions\r\nthoroughly and unhesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"We don't think in terms of price at all. Whatever we sell has got to be\r\nup to our standard in quality material, quality workmanship, and quality\r\nof design. ... You see, you've got to have a point of view in this thing.\r\nThat's all we've got is a point of view, and we stick to it.\"\r\n\r\nWhat he calls a \"point of view\" others would simply define as \"taste.\"\r\nAnd Hoving is well qualified to have strong opinions in this area. At the\r\nage of 30, three years after joining R.H. Macy and Company, he was\r\nalready a vice president and merchandising director. At that point, says\r\nHoving, \"I realized that design was going to be a coming thing, and I\r\nreally didn't know much about it. So I matriculated at New York\r\nUniversity in their arts department, and I took courses on period furniture,\r\nold silver, historic textiles, color and design. It took me three years, twice\r\na week at night. ... Then, of course, I could learn by going into people's\r\nhomes that were beautiful, in England and France, at museums --\r\nwherever I was. You learn if you have a basis. And so I advise anybody\r\nwho comes into this business to get knowledgeable about decorative arts.\"\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Macy's, he climbed steadily, becoming vice president of\r\nMontgomery Ward, president of Lord & Taylor, and president of Bonwit\r\nTeller. Upon arriving at Tiffany's, one of the first things he did was to\r\ndiscontinue selling anything that didn't conform to his esthetic standards,\r\nregardless of profit.\r\n\r\nThe current 180-page catalogue lists almost 100 items under $25, along\r\nwith such unabashed luxuries as a porcelain dessert service for six priced\r\nat $4,200 and an unpriced \"seashell\" necklace of 18-carat gold with\r\ndiamonds set in platinum. Tiffany's carries no synthetic gems because,\r\naccording to Hoving, \"everything here is real,\" and no men's diamond\r\nrings because \"we think they're vulgar.\" He adds: \"I dropped antique\r\nsilver. I saw no reason why Tiffany should carry it. You can get antiques\r\nanyplace. Our job is to make antiques for the future.\"\r\n\r\nSince 1963, Tiffany has opened branch stores in five other cities. Several\r\nfloors in the Fifth Avenue headquarters house artists, engravers,\r\nclockmakers and jewelry craftsmen. There is also a Tiffany factory in\r\nNew Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe author of two best-selling books, _Your Career in Business_ and\r\n_Tiffany's Table Manners for Teenagers_, Hoving is a deeply religious\r\nman who has long been actively involved in charitable work. He is a co\r\nfounder of the Salvation Army Association of New York, and gives his\r\ntime to the United Negro College Fund, the United Service Organizations,\r\nand, most recently, a home for heroin-addicted girls in Garrison, New\r\nYork, which has been named in his honor.\r\n\r\nWhen a friend at St. Bartholomew's Church asked Hoving to make her a\r\npin reading \"Try God,\" he got the idea of selling the pin at Tiffany's and\r\ngiving the proceeds to the Walter Hoving Home. So far, 600,000 have\r\nbeen sold.\r\n\r\nJane Pickens Hoving, his wife since 1977, is the founder and chairman of\r\nan organization known as Tune in New York, which matches volunteers\r\nto jobs best suited for their talents and interests. It is about to open a\r\nheadquarters at 730 Fifth Avenue, across from Tiffany's.\r\n\r\nHis son Thomas Hoving served as commissioner of parks for New York\r\nCity and for many years was director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r\nHe recently wrote a book on Tutankhamen and has another book in the\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nAn Eastsider for over 50 years, Walter Hoving walks more than three\r\nmiles a day between his home and office. He frequently mixes with\r\ncustomers in the store, and one of his favorite anecdotes is about the time\r\nhe spoke with a woman who was registering her daughter for wedding\r\npresents. \"The woman said that she and her husband wanted everything\r\nto come from Tiffany's because they were sure if it was from Tiffany's\r\nit would be all right,\" relates Hoving. \"I said, 'What does your husband\r\ndo?' She said, 'He is a letter carrier.' Well, I felt better than if I had sold\r\nMrs. Astorbilt a million-dollar diamond ring.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JAY JACOBS\r\nRestaurant critic for _Gourmet_ magazine\r\n\r\n2-9-80\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar scene to New York restaurateurs: an out-of-town visitor\r\narrives clutching a magazine, turns to an article, and orders the items that\r\nhave been underlined. Whether the magazine is current or several years\r\nold, the chances are that it is _Gourmet_ and that the article is a review\r\nby Jay Jacobs, _Gourmet's_ New York restaurant critic since 1972.\r\n\r\nIts monthly circulation of 600,000 makes _Gourmet_ the most widely read\r\nfood publication in the English-speaking world. But Jacobs, who is\r\nresponsible for writing three lengthy reviews per issue, is quick to point\r\nout that, in spite of his knowledge of the business and his love of cooking,\r\nhe would never consider opening a restaurant himself.\r\n\r\n\"I think everybody born in this century has fantasized about a restaurant,\r\nbut I think it would be insane,\" he says in a voice as rich and mellow as\r\nvintage port. \"One of the great tragedies of the restaurant business is that\r\npeople who cook well at home often think that's all it takes. ... If you've\r\ngot any interest in food and the least bit of talent, you can probably cook\r\na better meal for four people than you'll ever get in any restaurant in the\r\nworld -- if you want to invest that kind of labor and time, and\r\nconcentration. But there's a huge gap between doing that and serving\r\nanywhere from 70 to 130 people at night, all wanting different dishes. It\r\nbecomes a tremendous problem of strategy and logistics.\"\r\n\r\nAffable, low-keyed, and very small of stature, Jacob displays a wry wit\r\nwhile telling how he began his career as a painter, cartoonist and\r\nillustrator before turning to full-time writing in 1956. For years he worked\r\nmainly for art publications, and he still writes a bimonthly column for\r\n_theArtgallery_ magazine. His first book, a quickie titled _RFK: His Life\r\nand Death_, came out in 1968. He is also the author of _A History of\r\nGastronomy_, _New York a la Carte_, and _Winning the Restaurant\r\nGame_ (McGraw-Hill, 1980).\r\n\r\n_Winning the Restaurant Game_ is an extremely humorous and\r\nentertaining volume that is notable for its exotic vocabulary. However, the\r\nbook's message is not to be taken lightly -- that restaurant dining is a\r\ncomplex game in which the best players can expect better service, better\r\nfood, and the lasting affection of the owner. All the conventions of dining\r\nout, including who to tip and how much, are discussed in depth. Among\r\nthe subchapters are \"Humbling the Opposition,\" \"The Uselessness of\r\nMenus,\" \"Addressing Flunkies,\" and \"Securing Advantageous Tables.\"\r\n\r\nHis next book, _Winning the Kitchen Game_, is due from McGraw-Hill\r\nnext winter.\r\n\r\nJacobs dines out at least once a day while in the city. He visits restaurants\r\nseveral times before doing a review -- always anonymously, and generally\r\naccompanied by others. \"My job,\" he says, \"is to find worthwhile places\r\nthat our readers will want to go to. The magazine's policy is not to do\r\nunfavorable reviews. If I think a place stinks, I don't go back and I don't\r\nreview it. ... Most of our readers are knowledgeable about food,\r\nsomewhat self-indulgent, affluent, and well-travelled. When they come\r\ninto New York, they don't want to find some cut-rate taco house, and they\r\ndon't want to know about the bad places. They're only in for a few days,\r\nand they want to hit the high spots.\r\n\r\n\"The daily press have a different readership and a different function. ...\r\nWhen they do a favorable review, it can damage a restaurant in that it\r\ngenerates a sudden spurt of interest that the restaurant can't handle.\"\r\n\r\nThe father of four boys, Jacobs is a very sociable person who enjoys\r\nthrowing parties for 50 to 60. To prepare the food, he says, \"I lock\r\nmyself in the kitchen for three or four days.\"\r\n\r\nHis _Gourmet_ reviews are so detailed that Jacobs gets letters from\r\nreaders across the country who tell how they have recreated a night at the\r\nFour Seasons or 21 \"by analyzing what I have written, and approximating\r\nthe dishes.\" But what makes his job particularly gratifying is the restaurant\r\npeople themselves.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very impressed by these restaurant guys. If you travel in Europe you\r\nsee them when they're 13 years old, schlepping suitcases in some motel\r\nand dreaming of the day when they open their own restaurant. They\r\nusually come out of small towns or even villages, and don't have the\r\nbenefit of birth or upbringing or schooling. And the next thing you know,\r\nit's 30 years later and they can converse very adequately with Henry\r\nKissinger or Jackie Onassis or anyone else, and maintain a business and\r\nmake it work.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER RAUL JULIA\r\nStar of _Dracula_ on Broadway\r\n\r\n5-26-79\r\n\r\n\"It's nice to be a vampire eight times a week,\" says Raul Julia, the star\r\nof _Dracula_ at the Martin Beck Theatre. Last October he took over the\r\nrole made famous by Frank Langella, and now Julia -- pronounced \"Hoo\r\nlia\" by his Puerto Rican countrymen -- has developed a cult following of\r\nhis own, in this classic remake of the 1927 Broadway hit.\r\n\r\nSome critics have said that the sets and costumes by Edward Gorey are\r\nthe centerpieces of the show, more so than any of the performers. But\r\nRaul Julia is rapidly becoming a local matinee idol, drawing fan mail by\r\nthe bagful and constantly meeting crowds of autograph seekers outside the\r\nstage door.\r\n\r\nIn his portrayal of Count Dracula, Raul takes on many characteristics of\r\na bat. He hangs over the mantlepiece at strange angles and whips his dark\r\ncloak through the air like a bat's wings. When entrapped by three\r\ndesperate men holding protective crosses and religious relics in front of\r\nthem, he changes into a bat and flies out the window at the stroke of\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nIn the dressing room prior to a performance, without his makeup, he looks\r\nneither sinister nor magnetically attractive, but seems almost boyish. His\r\nwit is matched by his humility: Raul is aware that his name is not yet a\r\nhousehold word. Not many people realize, for example, that his natural\r\nspeaking voice has the same lilting Puerto Rican accent heard everywhere\r\nin the streets and subways of New York. When asked how he accounts for\r\nhis flawless onstage pronunciation, Raul shrugs and says with a grin,\r\n\"Well, that's acting.\"\r\n\r\nLike Richard Chamberlain, who in 1970 played Hamlet with great success\r\non the British stage, Julia is equally at home in British and American\r\nplays. He has starred in many of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare\r\nFestival productions, and has received three Tony nominations for his\r\ndramatic and musical roles on Broadway.\r\n\r\nHe sips a glass of apricot juice while a makeup artist brushes his jet black\r\nhair straight back and starts to darken his eyes. Removing his shoes, Raul\r\ntells all sorts of little anecdotes about his life as the famous Count.\r\n\r\n\"I usually eat very little during the day. I go to sleep at about five,\r\nsometimes six. Maybe I'm getting a Dracula schedule,\" he says with a\r\nlaugh. \"Some people who see the show write and say they're going to\r\nkeep their windows open at night.\r\n\r\n\"Dracula is a myth, although some people think there actually are\r\nvampires. Bram Stoker really created the character of Dracula, taking\r\nlegends from different parts of the world, like the stories of sailors who\r\nhad been stricken by bats, appearing on deck the next morning, all pale,\r\nwithout blood in them.\r\n\r\n\"I hear that Bela Lugosi was buried in a Dracula costume. I also hear that\r\nBoris Karloff came to the funeral home to visit him and looked down at\r\nthe coffin and said, 'You're not kidding are you sweetie?'\"\r\n\r\nDracula the character is more than 500 years old; Julia the actor declines\r\nto give his age. \"Actors should be ageless,\" he says. \"You see, what age\r\ndoes, it limits you to a certain category.\" He doesn't mind telling his\r\nheight, however. \"Eight foot four,\" he quips. \"No, six two.\"\r\n\r\nHe was, in fact, born 30-odd years ago in San Juan. In 1964, after\r\ngraduating from the university there, he was performing in a local\r\nnightclub revue, and comedian Orson Bean happened to be in the\r\naudience. Bean urged him to come to New York, and introduced him to\r\nWynn Handman of the American Place Theatre. Although he had not\r\nstudied acting formally, Raul's natural ability and his versatility soon\r\nbegan to pay off. Within two years he was playing lead roles for Joseph\r\nPapp.\r\n\r\nMarried for the past three years to dancer/actress Merel Poloway, Raul\r\ndevotes a great deal of his spare time to a charitable organization called\r\nthe Hunger Project. \"The purpose of the group is to support anything that\r\nwill help bring an end to hunger by 1997. Our goal is to transform the\r\natmosphere that exists now,. That says that hunger is inevitable. All the\r\nexperts and scientists agree that we have the means right now to end the\r\nstarvation on the planet.\"\r\n\r\nA resident of the Upper West Side for the past 10 years, Raul has two\r\nmajor projects coming up -- the title role of Othello for Shakespeare-in\r\nthe-Park this summer and a movie called _Isabel_, which he will film in\r\nPuerto Rico this spring: \"I wanted to be in it because it's a totally Puerto\r\nRican venture, and I want to encourage the beginning of a quality movie\r\nindustry.\"\r\n\r\nRaul appears to be utterly at ease as he prepares to make his stage\r\nentrance in the middle of the first act of _Dracula_. I have time for one\r\nmore question: \"Is the acting life everything you hoped it would be?\"\r\n\r\nRaul wraps the cloak around himself and heads out of the dressing room.\r\nHe looks back at me and smiles. \"Yes,\" he replies. \"_Now_ it is.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER BOB KANE\r\nCreator of Batman and Robin\r\n\r\n3-24-79\r\n\r\nAt the 1939 World's Fair in New York, a time capsule was filled with\r\nmemorabilia thought to be representative of 20th-century American\r\nculture, and scheduled to be opened by historians 5,000 years later.\r\nAmong the objects chosen was a comic magazine that had appeared for\r\nthe first time that year, the creation of an 18-year-old artist and writer\r\nnamed Bob Kane. Whoever chose the contents of the time capsule must\r\nhave been prophetic, because today, 40 years later, few characters in\r\nAmerican fantasy or fiction are so well known as Kane's pulp hero --\r\nBatman.\r\n\r\n\"It was a big success from the very beginning,\" says the cartoonist, a tall,\r\nwiry, powerful-looking man of 58 whose tanned, leathery features bear a\r\nstriking resemblance to those of Bruce Wayne, Batman's secret identity.\r\n\"Superman started in 1938, and the same company, D.C. Comics, was\r\nlooking for another superhero. I happened to be in the right place at the\r\nright time.\r\n\r\n\"The first year, Batman was more evil, more sinister. My concept was for\r\nhim to scare the hell out of the denizens of the underworld. And then the\r\nsecond year, I introduced Robin, because I realized he would appeal to the\r\nchildren's audience. That's when the strip really took hold.\"\r\n\r\nThe walls of his Eastside apartment are covered with vintage hand-drawn\r\npanels by America's most famous cartoonists, and Kane, with his casual\r\nattire, his broad New York accent, and his habit of twirling his glasses\r\naround while slumped far down in his easy chair, would not seem out of\r\nplace as a character in Maggie and Jiggs. Yet he likes to consider himself\r\na serious artist, and has, in fact, had some notable achievements in his\r\n\"second career,\" which began in 1966 when he resigned from D.C.\r\nComics, on the heels of the successful _Batman_ TV series.\r\n\r\n\"I got tired of working over the drawing board after 30 years. I wanted\r\nto be an entrepreneur -- painter, screenplay writer, and producer.\" Since\r\nthat time, he has built up a large body of work -- oil paintings,\r\nwatercolors, pen and ink sketches and lithographs, most of them depicting\r\ncharacters from Batman. They have been purchased by leading\r\nuniversities, famous private collectors, and New York's Museum of\r\nModern Art.\r\n\r\nAs a writer, Kane has created four animated cartoon series for television,\r\nhas penned a screenplay for Paramount Pictures, _The Silent Gun_, has\r\nwritten an autobiography titled _Batman and Me_ (due to be published\r\nnext year), and has completed a screenplay for a full-length Batman\r\nmovie. Recently, he has also emerged as an active participant in charitable\r\ncauses, such as UNICEF, Cerebral Palsy and the American Cancer\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n>From March 16 to April 8, the Circle Gallery at 435 West Broadway in\r\nSoHo will exhibit a one-man show of about 40 Kane originals. Says Kane\r\nwith his typical immodesty: \"I'm probably the first cartoonist to make the\r\ntransition to fine art. When you do hand-signed, limited editions of\r\nlithographs, you are definitely entering the world of Lautrec and Picasso\r\nand Chagall.\"\r\n\r\nKane has lived on the East Side for the past 15 years and has no plans to\r\nleave. Asked about his early years, he tells of growing up poor in the\r\nBronx. \"I used to draw on all the sidewalks, and black out the teeth of the\r\ngirls on the subway posters. I used to copy all the comics as a kid, too.\r\nThat was my school of learning. ... My greatest influence in creating\r\nBatman was a sketch by Leonardo da Vinci of a flying machine, which I\r\nsaw when I was 13 years old. It showed a man on a sled with huge bat\r\nwings attached to it. To me, it looked like a bat man. And that same year,\r\nI saw a movie called _The Mark of Zorro_, with Douglas Fairbanks\r\nSenior. Zorro fought for the downtrodden and he had a cave in the\r\nmountainside, and wore a mask, which gave me the idea for Batman's\r\ndual identity and the Batmobile.\"\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, Kane takes much pride in his lifelong success.\r\n\"Batman has influenced four decades of children,\" he declares. \"It has\r\ninfluenced the language. ... It has influenced people's lives whereby it\r\ngives them a sense of hope that the good guy usually wins in the end. And\r\nmainly, the influence has been one of sheer entertainment. I feel that most\r\npeople would like to be a Batman-type superhero, to take them out of their\r\ndull, mundane routine of everyday living. ... My greatest thrill comes\r\nfrom my 5-year-old grandson. Little did I know when I was 18 that one\r\nday I would see my grandson wearing a little Batman costume, driving\r\naround in a miniature Batmobile and yelling 'Batman!'\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LENORE KASDORF\r\nStar of _The Guiding Light_\r\n\r\n1-20-79\r\n\r\nFor the pat few months at least, the hottest soap opera on television has\r\nbeen CBS' _The Guiding Light_, which reaches approximately 10 million\r\nviewers nationwide. The show has 22 regular characters, and right now\r\nthe one who is getting the most attention is Rita Stapleton, a beautiful but\r\ndeceitful nurse who recently brought up the ratings for the week when she\r\nwas raped by her ex-lover on the night before her engagement to another\r\nman. It was all in a day's work for Westsider Lenore Kasdorf, who\r\nportrays the popular villainess.\r\n\r\n\"This is definitely a job, and you get the feeling of a schedule, of\r\npunching in and punching out, of rolling it off the presses. But you put in\r\nyour creative element too,\" says Miss Kasdorf, taking a break between\r\nscenes at the studio. With her soft hazel eyes, pearly teeth, finely chiseled\r\nfeatures, and billowing brown hair, she is nothing short of stunning -- an\r\nimpression that is heightened by her throaty voice and by the red sweater\r\nthat covers her ample figure.\r\n\r\nBeing the star of an hour-long \"soap\" means that Lenore often has to work\r\nfrom 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. inside the mazelike studio, so that in winter, an\r\nentire week may go by when she doesn't see sunlight. Although she\r\nreceives a tremendous number of fan letters, Lenore does not have time\r\nto answer most of them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a letter writer anyway,\" she explains. \"There are times when\r\nsomeone is so sincere that you feel you really want to respond. I have had\r\npeople send me a dollar check for postage. My heart goes out sometimes;\r\nI get guilty when I read my mail. This audience is very responsive. They\r\nlove to comment about the show. I get a lot of identifying mail. Some\r\npeople say, 'You're like the sister I wish I had.' Sometimes there's\r\nstrange mail. Sometimes there's lewd mail, which is removed before I can\r\nread it.\" She laughs vigorously. \"That's fine with me, because then I can\r\nenjoy all my mail.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about which part of the Upper West Side she lives in, Lenore\r\ndeclines to say. \"I have some fans who would follow my footprints in the\r\nsnow. You have to be careful. My husband and I tend to stay in the\r\nneighborhood a lot, and I'd hate to ruin our indiscreet little way of getting\r\naround. ... In New York people are used to seeing Al Pacino walking\r\ndown the street, or Jackie O. shopping at the corner. But out of town --\r\nat first they're not sure if it's you. A lot of people come up to me and\r\nsay, 'Do you ever watch _The Guiding Light_? You look so much like\r\nthat girl.' I usually tell them who I am. I can't see any point in lying.\r\nFace it, that's part of the reason we're doing this. I'm sure there's a ham\r\nin every actor, whether they're shy about it or not.\"\r\n\r\nHer husband, actor Phil Peters, recently won the part of Dr. Steven\r\nFarrell on _As The World Turns_, another CBS soap opera. Within a few\r\nweeks, however, there was a change of writers. \"The new writers wanted\r\nto bring in their own characters,\" says Lenore, \"so on the show, Phil just\r\ndisappeared in the night. He never showed up for his wedding. All the\r\nother characters were saying, 'Where could he be?'\" She laughs at the\r\nrecollection of what happened soon afterward when she and her husband\r\nwere visiting Fredericksburg, Virginia: \"A woman came up behind Phil\r\nwhile we were eating dinner, and said, 'Shame on you! How could you\r\nrun off on that pretty little thing?'\"\r\n\r\nBorn 30 years ago on Long Island, the daughter of an Army officer,\r\nLenore grew up in such diverse places as Tennessee, Indiana, Virginia,\r\nGermany and Thailand. After graduating from the International School in\r\nBangkok, she \"got out of the Army\" and returned to the U.S. to attend\r\ncollege in Indiana. There she began to do local TV commercials, and was\r\nso successful that she decided to try her luck in California. Quickly she\r\nbecame an established television actress, winning roles in many prime\r\ntime series, including _Starsky and Hutch_, _Barnaby Jones_, and\r\n_Ironside_. While performing for a small theatre company she met Phil\r\nPeters. Phil wanted to come to New York to work in the theatre, and,\r\nwith some reservations, Lenore came with him. Although Phil does not\r\nhave a regular acting assignment at present, Lenore points out that \"actors\r\nare never out of work. They're just between jobs.\"\r\n\r\n_The Guiding Light_, says Lenore, \"was originally a religious program\r\non the radio, where the moral of the story was an enlightening lesson for\r\neverybody.\" Since moving to television in 1952, the show has changed\r\nconsiderably in content, but, according to Lenore, it still contains many\r\nlessons that are relevant to modern living.\r\n\r\n\"You can tell from mail that you do help people, whether you mean to or\r\nnot,\" says the actress with obvious satisfaction. \"I've gotten letters saying,\r\n'Seeing Rita through that difficulty has enlightened me about my own\r\nsituation.' She has not helped by example, because Rita doesn't always do\r\nthings right. But she shows how much trouble you can get into by\r\nbehaving the way she does, and in that way I think she helps people avoid\r\nthe same mistakes.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER BRIAN KEITH\r\nBack on Broadway after 27 years\r\n\r\n12-29-79\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1980, the curtain will finally ring down on _Da_, Hugh\r\nLeonard's strikingly original and poignant drama about a man's fond\r\nmemories of his working-class Irish father. _Da_ won four Tony Awards\r\nin 1978, including Best Play. Since July 30, the title role has been ably\r\nfilled by Brian Keith, an actor perhaps best known for playing \"Uncle\r\nBill\" in the situation comedy _Family Affair_, one of television's most\r\npopular shows from 1966 to 1971. Recently he has been seen in the TV\r\nspecials _Centennial, The Chisholms_ and _The Seekers_. In his long,\r\nillustrious career, the 57-year-old actor has starred in four other TV series\r\nand appeared in more than 60 motion pictures.\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1940s, when he worked primarily on Broadway, Keith\r\nrented an apartment on East 66th Street with a fireplace and kitchen for\r\n$70 a month. Leaving for Hollywood in 1952, he eventually married a\r\nHawaiian actress, and nine years ago became a full-time resident of\r\nHawaii.\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't been to New York for years and years and years, and when we\r\ncame here for a vacation last winter, I saw a play every night for a couple\r\nof weeks,\" says Keith. \"_Da_ was the only one I thought I'd really like\r\nto do sometime.\" Not long afterward, Barnard Hughes, the Tony Award\r\nwinning star of _Da_, decided to tour with the show, and Keith was\r\noffered a five-month contract to replace him. Delighted with the chance\r\nto return to Broadway in such a compelling role after a 27-year absence,\r\nKeith quickly said yes. Bringing his wife and children to New York for\r\nan extended visit, he again chose the Upper East Side as a place to live.\r\n\r\nA big, brawny 6-footer whose deep, gravelly voice and slothful\r\nmannerisms somehow bring to mind a friendly trained bear, Keith\r\nnormally spends the time between his matinee and evening performances\r\nsleeping on an Army cot in his dressing room. On this particular day, he\r\nis sitting in the sparsely furnished room with his shirt off, smoking a\r\ncigarette and answering questions about his career. His initially gruff\r\ndemeanor soon gives way to laughter, sentiment, hopefulness and\r\ncynicism in equal measure. A no-holds-barred conversationalist, he talks\r\nabout the acting life with a rare frankness.\r\n\r\nTaking over the role of Da with only about 20 hours of rehearsal, says\r\nKeith, was \"just a matter of trouping it.\" He didn't find the task too\r\ndifficult, partly because of his Irish background. Asked how far back his\r\nancestry goes, Keith laughs and says, \"How far back? If you go back far\r\nenough, you never stop. I'm Irish on both sides. On my father's side they\r\ncame over in Revolutionary days. On my mother's side, five or six\r\ngenerations. It stays, though. The first time I went to Ireland, I felt the\r\nwhole deja vu thing. I knew what I'd see around the next corner when I\r\nwalked.\"\r\n\r\nHe was born in the backstage of a theatre in Bayonne, New Jersey. \"I was\r\nthere about a week. I'm always getting letter from people saying: 'I'm\r\nfrom Bayonne too!' My parents were actors, so we went everywhere. ...\r\nI went to high school in Long Island. Very ... very nothing. And I didn't\r\ncare a damn thing about acting.\"\r\n\r\n>From 1945 to 1955 he served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a sergeant in\r\nthe Pacific campaign. \"When I got out of the service, I was just banging\r\naround, looking for a job. I didn't have an education or anything. A guy\r\noffered me a part in a play and I didn't know whether I'd ever get another\r\none. But I did, so it's been very nice. Very lucky. It's unlike the usual\r\nstruggle that people go through.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the conversation lands on _Meteor_, his latest movie, Keith declines\r\ncomment, choosing to speak instead of _The Last of the Mountain Men_,\r\na feature film that was completed in July and is scheduled for a Easter\r\nrelease. \"Charlton Heston and I co-star. It's about two trappers in the\r\nWest in 1830, and what happens to them when the beaver period comes\r\nto a close. The two guys are like Sundance and Butch. But damn well\r\nwritten. It's one of the best scripts I ever read. Heston's kid wrote it. He\r\nworked for a couple of years up around Idaho and Montana as a river\r\nguide. There's not a wasted word in the script.\"\r\n\r\nMany of his films and TV shows Keith has never seen. \"If it's some piece\r\nof junk, I don't see why I should bother. It's bad enough you did it. But\r\nto live through it again!. ... You can't sit around and wait for something\r\nyou think is _worthy_ of you.\"\r\n\r\nBrian and his wife Victoria have two children. Mimi, his daughter from\r\na previous marriage, is a member of the Pennsylvania Ballet Company.\r\nBetween acting assignments, says Keith with affection, he spends most of\r\nhis time \"raising the damn kids. It's a 24-hour job. We do a lot of outdoor\r\nstuff, because in Hawaii you can, all year round. We go on the beach and\r\ncamp out and all that crap.\"\r\n\r\nHe finds that being based in Hawaii causes no problems with his career.\r\n\"It doesn't make any difference where you live,\" Keith growls softly.\r\n\"People live in London, in Spain, in Switzerland. You don't go around\r\nlooking for jobs. You wait till your agent calls you and you get on a plane\r\nand go. You can be halfway around the world overnight, from anywhere.\r\nIt beats Bayonne.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER HAROLD KENNEDY\r\nAuthor of _No Pickle, No Performance_\r\n\r\n7-22-78\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Harold Kennedy's theatrical career, he was involved\r\nin a play written by Sinclair Lewis, who may have been a great novelist\r\nbut was no playwright. Kennedy was talking with Lewis one evening\r\nbefore the play opened when a young student approached the famous\r\nauthor and politely asked for an autograph. Lewis took the piece of paper\r\nthe boy offered him and wrote on it: \"Why don't you find a hobby that\r\nisn't a nuisance to other people?\" He handed it back unsigned.\r\n\r\nBut the boy got even. The play opened a few nights later and was a total\r\ndisaster. Lewis was sitting gloomily in the dressing room after the final\r\ncurtain when a note was hand-delivered to him by an usher. He opened it\r\nand read, in his own handwriting: \"Why don't you find a hobby that isn't\r\na nuisance to other people?\"\r\n\r\nThe story is one of dozens told in Harold Kennedy's book, _No Pickle,\r\nNo Performance_, published this month by Doubleday. The book is a\r\nfascinating collection of true-life anecdotes stored up by Kennedy during\r\nhis four decades in the theatre as a director, actor, and playwright on\r\nBroadway and across the country. The subtitle of his book is \"An\r\nIrreverent Theatrical Excursion from Tallulah to Travolta,\" and he has\r\nwritten chapters about his experiences with both of these stars, in addition\r\nto Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Thornton Wilder, Gloria Swanson,\r\nSteve Allen, and others who are less well known today but were legends\r\nin their time.\r\n\r\nIts book is dedicated to actress Renee Taylor, who refused to come on\r\nstage during a play's opening night until she got a pickle with her\r\nsandwich, as she had during the previews. The coffee shop that had\r\nprovided those sandwiches was closed, and the curtain was held while a\r\nprop man got in his car and went searching for the holy pickle. It arrived\r\nseven minutes after the advertised curtain time, and the show went on.\r\n\r\nUnknown to Taylor, the stage crew was so enraged by her antics that they\r\nperformed \"a little ceremony\" with the pickle before giving it to her.\r\nGloria Swanson later said: \"Poor Miss Taylor. Can't you see her shopping\r\naround to every delicatessen in New York complaining that she can never\r\nfind a pickle to match the caliber of the one she had in New Jersey.\"\r\n\r\nI meet the author on a recent evening at Backstage on West 45th Street.\r\n\"The thing about this book,\" he says, \"is that whether people know the\r\nactors or not, they find the stories amusing. You know, I never thought\r\nof writing these stories down. I used to tell them to other members of the\r\ncompany over drinks after the show, and everyone loved them. But I'm\r\nan actor, and I thought what made them funny was the way I told them.\r\nI didn't know how they'd look in print. A good friend of mine finally\r\nconvinced me to write about a hundred pages, and I said, \"If anyone\r\nwants it, I'll write the whole thing.\" The first publisher I sent it to --\r\nDoubleday -- accepted it.\"\r\n\r\nThose who have seen portions of the Ginger Rogers chapter in a recent\r\nissue of _New York_ magazine might think the book is malicious, but this\r\nis not the case. Says Kennedy: \"It just tells what happened, and some\r\npeople come out better than others.\"\r\n\r\nThe chapter begins: \"It seems that Ginger Rogers never smiles. It may be\r\nthat someone has told her it would crack her face. It may be more likely\r\nthat she's a lady devoid of one smidgin of one inch of a sense of humor.\"\r\nThe author describes her as \"colder than anyone else I had met. Totally\r\nunlike her screen self -- which only goes to prove what a good actress she\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nHe reveals Rogers at her worst when she attempts to make an actor out\r\nof her no-talent fifth husband, G. William Marshall, at the expense of\r\nKennedy and everyone else in the cast. The couple were still on their\r\nhoneymoon, and Rogers demanded that Bill be given the role of her\r\nleading man in _Bell, Book and Candle_. The results were disastrous.\r\nDetroit's leading critic wrote after the opening: \"The program lists Mr.\r\nMarshall as having been acquainted with many phases of show business.\r\nLast night he showed not even a nodding acquaintance with any of them.\"\r\n\r\nKennedy writes at the chapter's end: \"Hopefully Ginger will find another\r\nhusband. As it turned out, the last one apparently worked out worse for\r\nher than it did for me.\" Rogers is apparently considering a lawsuit against\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\nStill very active in the theatre at 64, Kennedy is undertaking three\r\nproductions this summer -- _Barefoot In the Park_ with Maureen\r\nO'Sullivan and Donny Most, _The Marriage-Go-Round_ with Kitty\r\nCarlisle, and _Bell, Book and Candle_ with Lana Turner. He is directing\r\nall three and acting in two of them.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago he directed John Travolta for a summer stock company\r\nthat opened to hordes of screaming teenagers in Skowhegan, Maine.\r\nWhenever Travolta made in entrance or an exit, Kennedy tells in the\r\nchapter titled \"John Who?\", he caused such a commotion that the play\r\nvirtually came to a halt. \"John is a darling. He's such a lovely boy,\" says\r\nthe author. \"He'd kiss me full on the lips when we met and parted. And\r\nI say that with no sense of implication. In the theatre, we've always been\r\nrelaxed about an expression of affection. ... I thought in _Saturday Night\r\nFever_ he was a star in the old tradition -- in the tradition of Tyrone\r\nPower. ... I couldn't call John intelligent, but he'll own the movie\r\nindustry in two years. And he has things in his contract that no other stars\r\nhave had, like approval of the final cut of the movie.\"\r\n\r\nA native of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Kennedy worked his way through\r\nDartmouth College and the Yale School of Drama \"and came out with a\r\nprofit.\" In 1937 he moved to New York; he has lived on the West Side\r\never since. Among his close friends are some of the merchants and\r\nartisans in his area. \"They care about theatre and they know we have\r\nspecial problems,\" he says. \"There's Mal the Tailor on West 72nd Street,\r\nfor example. If I'm doing a play and need something right away, he'll\r\ndrop everything and take care of me.\"\r\n\r\n_No Pickle, No Performance_ has already received many favorable\r\nreviews and has been partially reprinted in the _New York Post_.\r\nKennedy is planning to hit the talk shows soon with some of his leading\r\nladies. What seems to be uppermost in his mind at the moment, however,\r\nis whether Ginger Rogers will sue for libel.\r\n\r\n\"I kind of wish she would, just to get some publicity for the book,\" he\r\nmuses. \"Of course, she's a fool if she does, because she'd never win, and\r\nthe people who haven't heard of the book will rush out and get it. ... But\r\nI can say one thing: if there's a package from Ginger waiting for me in\r\nmy dressing room, I'm going to have it dumped in water.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ANNA KISSELGOFF\r\nDance critic for the _New York Times_\r\n\r\n6-9-79\r\n\r\nIt was 3 p.m., and as usual, Anna Kisselgoff was sitting before the\r\ncomputer-typewriter at the _New York Times'_ newsroom, putting the\r\nfinishing touches on her latest dance review. She had spent the morning\r\ndoing research, and had arrived at the _Times_ building around noon to\r\nbegin writing the article directly on the computer terminal, using her notes\r\ntaken the night before at a dance performance. At 8 o'clock that evening,\r\nshe would be attending yet another performance, but for the moment at\r\nleast, Miss Kisselgoff had a little time to herself, and when we sat down\r\nto talk in her three-walled cubicle office facing the relatively quiet\r\nnewsroom, she seemed noticeably relaxed and cheerful, notwithstanding\r\nthe pile of opened and unopened mail piled high on her desk.\r\n\r\n\"We get no help: that's the problem,\" she said, in a clear, even voice with\r\na tone that recalled Mary Tyler Moore. \"We have one secretary for nine\r\npeople in the arts and architecture department. She's terribly\r\noverworked,\" Anne went on, sweeping her hands like an orchestra\r\nconductor toward the stack of mail. \"You're looking at what's left after\r\nI've thrown away half of it. I make up the review schedule for the week\r\nbased on these releases.\"\r\n\r\nPetite, attractive, and looking somewhat younger than her 41 years, the\r\neffervescent Miss Kisselgoff soon got to the root of her problem.\r\n\r\n\"This time of year, everybody wants to be reviewed. The tragedy is that\r\ndancers _do_ wait until the spring, and then they give their one-shot\r\nconcert that they have been preparing all year, and it's on the same night\r\nthat 17 other dancers are giving theirs. I think it's suicidal. ... We have\r\nthree dance critics at the _Times_ -- Jack Anderson and Jennifer Dunning\r\nbesides myself -- and in the spring, all three of us are working every day,\r\nand we still can't keep up.\"\r\n\r\nAnna herself attends up to nine performances a week during the busy\r\nseason. Besides her regular pieces in the daily _Times_, she is responsible\r\nfor a long, comprehensive article in the Sunday edition. \"There has been\r\na tremendous increase in dance activity in the past 10 years,\" she\r\nexplained. \"In 1969, the year after I joined the paper, I was asked to do\r\na rundown of dance events, and I found there was not a single week in the\r\nyear that was free from dance. That was the first time it happened.\r\n\r\n\"I think the decade of the 1960s had something to do with it. That was\r\nwhen choreographers like Balanchine and Merce Cunningham, who used\r\npure movement, became most popular. The audience that came to see\r\nthem was a new audience that was already comfortable with abstraction.\r\nThey didn't require story ballets. One of the problems with dance in the\r\npast was the people thought they wouldn't be able to understand it. But if\r\nyou like plotless ballet, you don't have to understand any more than what\r\nyou see. I think Marshall McLuhan was right: this is the age of television.\r\nThis generation is used to watching images without getting bored.\"\r\n\r\nShe has no favorite dancers, but her favorite choreographers come down\r\nto two -- George Balanchine and Martha Graham. \"You don't have any\r\nyoung choreographers now who are really the stature of the old ones. I\r\ncan't give a reason why, except that it happened historically that the 1930s\r\nturned out to be the most creative period in dance -- not just in the United\r\nStates, but in most parts of the world. That's when the modern dance\r\npioneers became active. People like Martha Graham are revolutionaries,\r\nand you just don't get them in every generation. ... This applies to the\r\nother arts as well. Who are the great opera composers of today? And\r\nfrankly, are there any Tolstoys?\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Paris, Anna arrived on the Upper West Side at the age of one.\r\nShe attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania and later spent four\r\nyears in Paris as a general reporter for several English-language\r\nnewspapers, but otherwise she has been a lifelong Westsider. Dance has\r\nalways been one of her prime interests: she studied ballet for 10 years\r\nwhile a child, and remained an avid fan long after realizing she would not\r\nbecome a professional dancer.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1960s, Anna wrote an article on a major dance festival for the\r\ninternational edition of the _New York Times_ in Paris. This led to\r\nsimilar assignments. In October 1968, shortly after she returned to\r\nManhattan, the _Times_ hired her to assist chief dance critic Clive Barnes.\r\nShe quickly found herself writing many first-string reviews, and when\r\nBarnes resigned almost two years ago, Kisselgoff was named to replace\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOne of the disadvantages of her job, Anna pointed out, is that she is\r\nfrequently approached by strangers at intermission. \"I feel that everybody\r\nwho agrees or disagrees with me can do so by mail. I don't want to have\r\nlong discussions with people I don't know, because I think it's an invasion\r\nof my privacy as a person.\"\r\n\r\nThe advantages, however, far outweigh the inconveniences. \"I can even\r\nenjoy bad dance,\" she quickly added. \"That's why I'm very happy doing\r\nthis job. The day that I'll no longer be interested in watching a dance\r\nperformance, I think I should quit and go on to something else.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER GEORGE LANG\r\nOwner of the Cafe des Artistes\r\n\r\n8-4-79\r\n\r\nGeorge Lang, artist and perfectionist, could have become a success in any\r\nof a hundred professions. In 1946, when he arrived in the U.S. from his\r\nnative Hungary, he got a job as violinist with the Dallas Symphony. But\r\nLang soon discovered that the orchestra pit was too confining for a man\r\nof his vision. He might have turned to composition or conducting; instead\r\nhe decided to switch to a different field entirely -- cooking. Today, at 54,\r\nhe is the George Balanchine of the food world -- a \"culinary\r\nchoreographer\" with an international reputation for knowing virtually\r\neverything relevant that is to be known about food preparation and\r\nrestaurants.\r\n\r\nLang's imagination, _Gourmet_ magazine once wrote, \"is as fertile as the\r\nIndus Valley.\" This imagination, combined with his keen intelligence, his\r\nconcern for details, his natural versatility, and his seemingly endless\r\ncapacity for work, have enabled him to rewrite the definition of the term\r\n\"restaurant consultant.\"\r\n\r\nAs head of the George Lang Corporation, a loosely structured group of\r\nassociates that he founded in 1971, he commands $2,500 a day plus\r\nexpenses for jetting around the world, giving advice on restaurant and\r\nkitchen design, menu planning, and every other aspect of a restaurant\r\nfrom the lighting to the color of the napkins.\r\n\r\nHis large-scale projects in the past few years include food consulting and\r\ndesign for Marriot Motor Hotels, Holiday Inn, the Cunard Lines, and\r\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos. He was the chief planner for The\r\nMarket, a three-level, 20-shop marketplace in the East Side's Citicorp\r\nCenter. In 1975, when he took over the West Side's famous Cafe des\r\nArtistes, the business quadrupled within weeks.\r\n\r\nA prolific author as well, Lang has written several books and hundreds of\r\narticles for leading publications, including the _Encyclopedia Britannica_.\r\nHis column, \"Table for One,\" is a regular feature of _Travel & Leisure_\r\nmagazine. He has bottled burgundy under his own label, arranged parties\r\nfor the rich and famous, and served as consultant for _Time-Life's_ series\r\non international cookery.\r\n\r\nHis office has a miniature garden in the middle; the wall are lined with\r\n5,000 catalogued cookbooks. He comes sailing into the room and takes a\r\nseat at his semicircular desk, which all but engulfs him. Short in stature,\r\nbald as a gourd, he moves with a darting energy that sees him through 20\r\nhour workdays with as many as 30 food tastings. His softly accented\r\nspeech is the only thing about him that is slow, because Lang chooses his\r\nwords carefully, aiming for the same perfection in English as in\r\neverything else. Although modesty is not one of his characteristics, he\r\ngives full credit to his staff for being equal partners in his corporation's\r\nsuccess. There is a feeling of camaraderie in the air, as if all are members\r\nof a single family.\r\n\r\nThe Cafe des Artistes, he admits, was a moderately successful French\r\nrestaurant for 60 years before he took it over. \"But it needed spiritual\r\nchanges as well as physical changes. And -- let me underline this and\r\ntriple-space it -- excellent food. You cannot chew scenery. We maintain\r\na certain kind of formal informality, which simply means that anyone can\r\ncome, dressed any way they want, as long as their behavior will justify\r\ntheir white tie or dungarees. I could raise the prices by 50 to 100 percent\r\novernight, and I wouldn't lose a single customer. But feel an obligation\r\nto New York City and the restaurant industry to maintain what I call\r\nreasonable prices.\"\r\n\r\nHis corporation also owns the Hungaria Restaurant at Citicorp, which has\r\na gypsy orchestra from Budapest, and Small Pleasures, a pastry shop in\r\nthe same building. However, Lang stresses that \"98 percent of our\r\nbusiness comes from consulting. I always think in terms of problems and\r\nsolutions, because every restaurant must be designed to suit the needs of\r\na particular market. At Alexander's, for example, we came up with a\r\nrestaurant where you could have a reasonably pleasant luncheon for two\r\nto four dollars.\"\r\n\r\nStill an ardent music lover, George Lang plays the violin whenever time\r\npermits. He recently acquired a Stradivarius and says with a laugh, \"I'm\r\nthreatening to get back completely to shape and play a concert.\"\r\n\r\nLang enjoys the European atmosphere of the West Side, where he has\r\nlived for the past 30 years. Among his favorite Westside restaurants: the\r\nMoon Palace on Broadway, Sakura Chaya on Columbus, and Le Poulailler\r\non 65th Street.\r\n\r\nHis latest endeavor is a 4-to-6-minute TV spot titled _Lang at Large_,\r\nwhich is broadcast twice a month on the CBS network show _Sunday\r\nMorning_. \"It's part of my new career,\" he announces joyfully.\r\n\r\nAsked about which aspect of his work gives him the most satisfaction,\r\nLang ponders for a moment and concludes: \"It would be easiest for me to\r\nsay that my biggest thrill is to see an idea of mine become a three\r\ndimensional reality, especially if it may be a $50 million project. But\r\nactually, an even bigger thrill for me is to go to an obscure place in the\r\nworld, and see a bit of improvement in people's lives through the effort\r\nof someone who was my former disciple.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER RUTH LAREDO\r\nLeading American pianist\r\n\r\n12-30-78\r\n\r\nShe has frequently been called America's greatest female pianist -- a title\r\nwhich, as recently as the 1960s, almost any woman would have coveted.\r\nBut when the year is 1978 and the musician is Ruth Laredo, this\r\n\"compliment\" brings a different response.\r\n\r\n\"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Miss Laredo, sitting back on the\r\ncouch of her West Side living room. \"I would really rather be known as\r\nan American pianist. Being female doesn't preclude playing some of the\r\nmost powerful sounds on the piano.\"\r\n\r\nHer words are backed by accomplishments. In October, Ruth came to the\r\nend of a four-year project to record the complete works for solo piano by\r\nSergei Rachmaninoff, the late Russian-born composer who emigrated to\r\nthe U.S. after the Revolution of 1917. Almost all of his piano works were\r\ncomposed before 1910, and they rank among the most technically difficult\r\npieces ever written for the instrument. Laredo is the first person in history\r\nto record the piano solos in their entirety. Columbia Records will release\r\nthe final three discs of the seven-album set in early 1979.\r\n\r\nSlender, graceful, and radiantly attractive, Laredo is still adjusting to her\r\nrecently acquired status as a major international artist. For 14 years she\r\nwas married to the acclaimed Bolivian-born violinist, Jaime Laredo, and\r\nduring most of that time she was known primarily as his accompanist.\r\nShortly after their marriage broke up in 1974, her career began to soar.\r\nThat year the first of her Rachmaninoff recordings was made, and it won\r\nrave reviews. Her Lincoln Center debut with the New York Philharmonic\r\nOrchestra in December 1974 caused such a sensation that she was quickly\r\nsigned up to perform with the Boston, Philadelphia, National Symphony,\r\nCleveland, and Detroit orchestras. \"After 15 years,\" recalls Ruth, \"I was\r\nan overnight success.\"\r\n\r\nNow, at 41 -- but looking considerably younger -- she can look back on\r\nfour years of unbroken triumph. Following a recital at Alice Tully Hall\r\nin 1976, the _New York Times_ reported that she \"operated within a\r\nrelatively narrow range -- from first-rate to superb.\" Her talents have been\r\nconstantly in demand ever since across the U.S. and Canada. During the\r\n1976-77 season she had over 40 concerts, including tours of Europe and\r\nJapan. This season she will perform in Japan and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nAlthough her repertoire includes piano works spanning the last 250 years,\r\nRuth has concentrated largely on Rachmaninoff and Scriabin, a Russian\r\ncomposer of the same era. She has recorded five albums of Scriabin's\r\npiano solos. \"It's such strange music if you haven't heard it before,\" she\r\nsays. \"I gave some concerts of Scriabin at Hunter College, and talked\r\nabout each piece before playing it. I was kind of a crusader at the time for\r\nhis music. It was very rewarding for me. I think people are much more\r\nfamiliar with Scriabin today than they were 10 years ago.\r\n\r\n\"One thing I love to do is to talk to the audience after a concert. There's\r\na certain feeling of distance sometimes between the audience and classical\r\nmusicians, which need not happen.\"\r\n\r\nOn most days, Ruth practices at one of her twin grand pianos from about\r\n10:30 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon, when her 9-year-old\r\ndaughter Jennifer gets home from school. The walls of the Laredos' living\r\nroom are covered with neatly framed fingerpaintings that Jennifer created.\r\n\"She's intellectually brilliant and lots of fun. I take her to concerts with\r\nme when it's possible. When I gave a talk on Rachmaninoff to the cadets\r\nat West Point, they all called her 'ma'am.'\"\r\n\r\nA native of Detroit, Ruth began studying piano at the age of 2, performed\r\nwith the Detroit Symphony at 11, and entered the Curtis Institute of Music\r\nin Philadelphia at 16. There she met her future husband. During their\r\nyears together, Ruth longed for a solo career, but it somehow eluded her.\r\n\"I played with Leopold Stokowski and the American Symphony in the\r\n1960s,\" she says. \"There was a major concert I did at Carnegie Hall then,\r\nbut nobody heard about it. I think that women are being accepted on their\r\nown merits today. They weren't given a chance until recently.\"\r\n\r\nRuth keeps fit by riding her bicycle almost every day. She is a fan of the\r\nNew York Yankees -- \"I saw all the World Series games\" -- and likes to\r\ndo photography when she has the time. A Westsider ever since she moved\r\nto New York in 1960, Ruth lists Fiorello's (on Broadway across from\r\nLincoln Center) as her favorite restaurant. When she needs music supplies\r\nof any kind, she goes to Patelson's (56th Street and 7th Avenue). Says\r\nRuth: \"It's a gathering place for musicians. The people who sell music\r\nthere are very friendly and very knowledgeable. ... They sell records\r\nthere. They sell my records.\"\r\n\r\nAsked whether men might have an inborn advantage at the piano, Ruth\r\ndenies the suggestion vigorously. \"Of course not,\" she replies. \"I can't\r\nimagine why a man should play the piano better than a woman. At West\r\nPoint, the women do everything the same as the male cadets except boxing\r\nand wrestling. Women might have smaller fingers on the average, but as\r\nfar as strength, speed, and dexterity are concerned, it's impossible to\r\nlisten to a recording and guess whether it was played by a man or a\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER STAN LEE\r\nCreator of Spiderman and the Incredible Hulk\r\n\r\n1-13-79\r\n\r\nWith the current rage over Superman due to last year's hit movie, many\r\npeople will purchase a copy of the comic for the first time in years, and\r\nmay be disappointed to see how much it has changed. Once the largest\r\nselling comic book hero on the market, Superman was knocked out of first\r\nplace long ago by Spiderman, the creation of a 56-year-old native New\r\nYorker named Stan Lee. Besides selling about one million Marvel comics\r\neach month, Spiderman appears as a daily strip in some 500 newspapers\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\nBut even without this giant success, Stan Lee would be rich and famous.\r\nHis fertile mind has also given birth to the Incredible Hulk, the Fantastic\r\nFour, Captain America, Doctor Strange, and a host of other modern-day\r\nmythological figures. As publisher of Marvel Comics, he rules over an\r\nempire that branches out into dozens of areas -- prime-time television\r\ndrama, animated cartoons, hardbound and paperback collections of comic\r\nreprints, novels about Marvel characters, toys, games, posters, clothing\r\nand much more. Most of these spin-off products are the work of other\r\ncompanies that have bought the rights, but Stan Lee remains the creative\r\nforce behind the whole operation, as I discover during a meeting with Lee\r\nat the Marvel headquarters on Madison Avenue.\r\n\r\n\"I think the title of publisher is just given to me so I can have more\r\nprestige when I'm dealing with people,\" says Lee in his clipped, precise\r\nvoice, as he stretches his feet onto the coffee table of his brightly\r\ndecorated office. \"I'm a salaried employee of Marvel -- your average\r\nhumble little guy trying to stay afloat in the stormy sea of culture. The\r\ncompany owns the properties, of course, but I have no complaints. I don't\r\nthink I could have as much anywhere else. ... My main interest is to see\r\nthat the company itself does well and makes as much money as possible.\"\r\n\r\nHe is an intense, energetic man of wiry build who dresses in a casual yet\r\nelegant manner. As he shifts the position of his arms and legs on the\r\ncouch, there is something unmistakably spiderlike in the movements. For\r\nall his politeness, he cannot mask the impression that his mind is racing\r\nfar ahead of his rapidly spoken words.\r\n\r\n\"My involvement with this company goes back to about 1939,\" says Lee.\r\n\"I was always the editor, the art director, the head writer, and the creative\r\ndirector [from the age of 17]. In the early 1960s I was thinking of\r\nquitting. I thought I wasn't really getting anywhere. My wife said, 'Why\r\nnot give it one last fling and do the kind of stories you want to do?' So I\r\nstarted bringing out the offbeat heroes. I never dreamt that they would\r\ncatch on the way they did.\"\r\n\r\nHe emphasizes that he did not create the characters alone, but co-created\r\nthem with the help of an artist. Nevertheless, it was Lee who\r\nrevolutionized the comic book industry by introducing the concept of what\r\nhas been termed the \"hung-up hero\" -- the superhero whose powers do not\r\npreclude him from having the same emotional troubles as the average\r\nmortal. This is what makes Lee's characters so believable and so\r\nirresistibly entertaining on television. It explains why CBS' _The\r\nIncredible Hulk_ is a hit, and why the same network has filmed eight\r\nepisodes of _The Amazing Spiderman_. On January 19 from 8 to 10 p.m.,\r\nCBS will broadcast the pilot for a new Marvel-based series, _Captain\r\nAmerica_.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Strange may come back again,\" says Lee. \"It was made into a two\r\nhour television movie.\" His old Spiderman cartoons, too, are still in\r\nsyndication.\r\n\r\nHe claims to work \"about 28 hours a day,\" and a look at his dizzying list\r\nof activities supports this claim. Besides running the Marvel headquarters,\r\nLee makes frequent trips to the West Coast to develop shows for ABC and\r\nCBS, writes some cartoons for NBC, acts as consultant to the Spiderman\r\nand Hulk programs, writes an introduction to each of the dozens of\r\nMarvel books published each year, writes occasional books and\r\nscreenplays of his own, gives lectures all over the country, and -- what to\r\nsome would be a full-time job in itself -- writes the plot and dialogue not\r\nonly for the Spiderman newspaper strip, but also, since November, for a\r\nHulk newspaper strip that already appears in more than 200 daily papers\r\nworldwide.\r\n\r\nFew people know Manhattan as well as Stan Lee. Born the son of a dress\r\ncutter in Washington Heights, he has made the Upper East Side his home\r\nfor the past 15 years. \"I'm a big walker,\" he explains. \"I'm a fast walker:\r\nI can easily average a block a minute. So if I want to walk to Greenwich\r\nVillage, I give myself an hour -- 60 blocks. I wouldn't know what time\r\nto leave if I took a cab.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about new projects in the works, Lee mentions that Marvel is\r\nplanning to produce some motion pictures that will be filmed in Japan.\r\n\"And I have a contract to write my autobiography,\" he adds. \"I was\r\nsurprised and delighted that they gave me five years to do it. So I presume\r\nI'll wait four years; maybe in that period, something interesting will\r\nhappen to me.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JOHN LEONARD\r\nBook critic for the _New York Times_\r\n\r\n3-22-80\r\n\r\n\"It's as if the job I have were designed for me,\" says bearded,\r\nbespectacled John Leonard, lighting his fifth cigarette of the early\r\nafternoon as he sits relaxed at his Eastside brownstone, talking about the\r\npleasures and perils of being one of the _New York Times'_ three daily\r\nbook critics. Like his colleagues Christopher Lehmann-Haupt and Anatole\r\nBroyard, Leonard writes two book reviews for the _Times_ each week,\r\nand is syndicated nationally. An avid reader since childhood, he now gets\r\nto read anything and everything he desires.\r\n\r\nThat's the advantage. The disadvantage, explains Leonard, is that \"there\r\nare 50 thousand books published every year in this country. You can\r\nnever even pretend to be comprehensive. You can't even pretend to be\r\nadequate in your coverage, whereas the _Times_ will review almost any\r\nplay that opens, on or Off Broadway, and almost every concert and\r\nmovie. We'll review maybe 400 books a year in the daily paper.\"\r\n\r\nA smallish, balding man of 41 who dresses purely for comfort and has a\r\ncalm, refined speaking manner, Leonard looks precisely like the\r\nbookworm he is. \"I'll get here, in this house, probably 5,000 or 6,000\r\nbooks a year, mailed to me, or brought by messenger. The luxury of this\r\njob is that there's so much to choose from that any mood or interest or\r\ncompulsion or desire to educate oneself or amuse oneself can be matched\r\nby some book that has come in.\"\r\n\r\nNew books by well-known authors, he says, are the first priority because\r\n\"they've earned reviews, for service to the literary culture over the\r\nyears.\" He and his two fellow critics \"divide up the plums and divide up\r\nthe dogs. Since I did Kissinger's memoirs, the next huge, endless book\r\nthat has to be reviewed, whether anybody wants to review it or not, will\r\nnot be reviewed by me.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhere between 100 and 140 serious first novels are published in the\r\nU.S. each year, according to Leonard. \"This is not pulp paperback\r\nwesterns. It doesn't even count science fiction or gothic or all that. I think\r\na special effort is made by all of us in the reviewing racket to review first\r\nnovels.\"\r\n\r\nHe reads many authors' first books on the recommendation of trusted\r\nagents and publishers. \"Over the years you decide who isn't lying to you.\r\n... Christopher Lehmann-Haupt was telling someone about that the other\r\nday. He said, 'Sure, you can call me as often as you want. But I'll say\r\nthat you begin with a hundred dollars in you bank account, and if it turns\r\nout that you are begging me to review a book that has no other redeeming\r\nvirtues but the fact that you have invested 50 or 80 thousand dollars'\r\nworth of advertising in it and you've got too many copies out in the\r\nbookstores that aren't moving, that bank account goes down. When you\r\ngive me a real surprise and a pleasure which is what makes this job\r\nworthwhile, the bank account goes up. But if the bank account goes down\r\nto zero, it's closed.'\r\n\r\n\"And that's right. There are people in this town who I won't take a\r\ntelephone call from. But that's the exception.\"\r\n\r\nApart from reading, writing and travel, Leonard has few interests. \"By\r\nMay, I can even look healthy, because I just sit out in the garden, getting\r\npaid to read,\" he says with a grin. He and his wife Sue, a schoolteacher,\r\nhave three children from previous marriages. His son Andrew will be\r\nstarting college in the fall.\r\n\r\nA book reviewer since 1967, including a five-year stint as editor of the\r\n_Sunday Times Book Review_, Leonard also write a warmly personal,\r\nfrequently humorous column in the Wednesday _Times_ titled \"Private\r\nLives.\" A collection of 69 of the columns appeared in book form last year\r\nunder the title _Private Lives in the Imperial City_ (Knopf, $8.95). In\r\naddition, he has published four novels and hundreds of free-lance articles\r\nfor magazines ranging from _Playboy_ to the _New Republic_. For years\r\nhe wrote TV reviews for _Life_ magazine under the pseudonym\r\n\"Cyclops.\" Recalls Leonard: \"It was a good way to turn your brain to\r\nSpam.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Washington, D.C., he grew up reading the _Congressional\r\nRecord_ instead of comics, and initially planned a career in law. Booted\r\nout of Harvard for neglecting his studies in favor of the campus\r\nnewspaper, he sharpened his journalistic skills under William F. Buckley\r\nJr. at the _National Review_ before completing college at the University\r\nof California's Berkeley campus. Following graduation, he became the\r\nprogram director of a radio station, wrote his first two novels, and worked\r\nin an anti-poverty program in Boston. Then he was invited to join the\r\n_Times_. \"I did my Westside and Village stuff when I was first here and\r\nbroke,\" comments Leonard. He has owned his four-story Eastside house\r\nsince 1971.\r\n\r\nAmong the most memorable books that Leonard has helped to \"discover\"\r\nare Joseph Heller's _Catch-22_ and Gunter Grass's _The Tin Drum_. \"To\r\nbe able to sit down one night, as I did, and to realize you're in the\r\npresence of an extraordinary talent, with no advance publicity, to be able\r\nto have a hole to fill in the paper two days later, to sit down and pull out\r\nall your adjectives and get people to buy the book: this is what you live\r\nfor,\" he sighs happily. \"You only need two or three of those to last a\r\nlifetime.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JOHN LINDSAY\r\nInternational lawyer\r\n\r\n7-1-78\r\n\r\nIt was said of John Kennedy that he was too young and too active a man\r\nto retire immediately after the presidency. Had he lived to serve two full\r\nterms, he would have been 51 upon leaving office. How he might have\r\nspent the remainder of his career is difficult to guess, but it's likely that\r\nhe would have ended up doing work very similar to what John Lindsay\r\ndoes today.\r\n\r\nA comparison between the two men is hard to escape. Both were war\r\nheroes. Both rose to power aided by their personal magnetism -- Kennedy\r\nto the nation's highest office at 43, Lindsay to the nation's second\r\ntoughest job at 44. Both gave eloquent speeches, aimed for high ideals,\r\nand made controversial decisions that brought plenty of criticism from\r\nwithin their own ranks.\r\n\r\nLindsay, now an international lawyer, has changed little in appearance\r\nsince he stepped down in 1974 after eight years in City Hall. The brown\r\nhair has turned mostly grey, and the lines in the face are slightly more\r\npronounced, but when he's behind the desk of his Rockefeller Plaza\r\noffice, his lean, immaculately dressed, 6-foot-3-inch frame resting\r\ncomfortably in a huge leather swivel chair, he still looks like a man who\r\nis very much in charge.\r\n\r\nHe is a partner in the corporate law firm of Webster and Sheffield, which\r\nhe first joined in 1948. \"This is a firm of about 75 lawyers,\" he says in\r\na soft, lyrical voice. \"We're general practice. ... I'm back into corporate\r\nlaw, and there's a fair amount of international work which takes me\r\nabroad quite a bit -- largely representing American businesses overseas.\r\nA lot of my work is done in French. I'm handling a complicated matter\r\ninvolving imports to this country, and a complex arrangement involving\r\noffshore oil exploration and drilling. Real estate transactions. The\r\npurchase of oil. A matter in Australia. Municipal counseling for a city in\r\nColorado ... \"\r\n\r\nThe international situation is beneficial to New York these days, says\r\nLindsay, because \"parts of the Western free world have a bad case of the\r\njitters. Europeans particularly, and also many people in the Middle East,\r\nfeel that this is a more stable place to invest their capital.\"\r\n\r\nLeaning back, with his feet propped up on another chair, he elaborates on\r\nforeign affairs: \"I think Carter's plane deal in the Middle East escalated\r\ntensions rather than reduced them. It's not a foreign policy to sell arms in\r\nthe Middle East. I think Americans have an obligation to spell out what\r\nour foreign policy is.\"\r\n\r\nExcept for a few public speaking engagements, Lindsay has devoted\r\nnearly all his attention this year to the practice of law. \"I used to spend\r\na little time with _Good Morning America_ on ABC, but I dropped it in\r\nJanuary because of the pressures of this office,\" he says. \"Recently I did\r\na pilot for public television. It's a small documentary that shows\r\ncataclysmic events in world history -- mostly from World War II -- and\r\nat the same time, shows what was going on in America. ... It might be\r\nturned into a series of documentaries.\"\r\n\r\nBecause he served four terms as congressman for Manhattan's Silk\r\nStocking district, Lindsay is generally associated with the East Side, but\r\nactually he was born on the West Side's Riverside Drive in 1921. One\r\nmonth after graduating from Yale in 1943, he enlisted in the Navy and\r\nserved for the next three years, taking part in the Sicily landing and the\r\ninvasion of the Philippines on his way to earning five battle stars.\r\n\r\nTwo years after leaving the service, he received his law degree, and seven\r\nyears after that, in 1955, his abilities impressed U.S. Attorney General\r\nHerbert Brownell so much that he made Lindsay his executive assistant.\r\nIn 1958, Lindsay ran for Congress and won, quickly establishing himself\r\nas a tireless worker for the rights of refugees. Lindsay was an early\r\nsupporter of the Peace Corps and a prominent member of the Council on\r\nForeign Relations.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving Gracie Mansion, John and his wife Mary and their\r\nchildren settled down on the West Side near Central Park. \"I feel very\r\nstrongly that the park is for people, and not for special interest groups,\"\r\nhe says. \"We introduced bicycling on weekends, and when I retired from\r\ngovernment we had a major plan to restore all of Central Park.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason he first got involved in politics, says Lindsay, was because\r\n\"out in the Pacific on lonely nights, after hearing the news of the death of\r\ngood friends, I made a determination that one day I was going to try to do\r\nsomething. I was determined that we weren't going to have war again.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to his years as mayor, Lindsay makes the simple statement that\r\n\"I did my best of a very tough job and I have no regrets about it. I look\r\nahead to the future.\"\r\n\r\nBut what will the future bring? Would he consider running for office\r\nagain?\r\n\r\n\"That's a tough question, Max,\" he replies. \"I know there's a lot of talk\r\nwith some of my friends about the Senate in 1980. I don't take that\r\nlightly. ... Right now I'm not making any plans to run. ... But you just\r\ndon't know, because life does funny things, and I also think there's a big\r\nvacuum out there now -- second-rate politics everywhere.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ALAN LOMAX\r\nSending songs into outer space\r\n\r\n9-17-77\r\n\r\nOn August 20, when the Voyager 2 spacecraft blasted off for a trip\r\nbeyond the solar system, it carried on its side a unique record player and\r\na single phonograph record. Included on that record are 27 musical\r\nselections that the _New York Times_ has called \"Earth's Greatest Hits.\"\r\nIf, someday, extraterrestrial creatures play the record and enjoy it, they\r\nwill be most indebted to the man who chose 13 of the songs -- Westsider\r\nAlan Lomax.\r\n\r\nThat Alan's advice should be so highly respected by a committee that\r\nspent eight weeks choosing the other 14 songs is a testimonial to his\r\nmusical reputation. Ever since he became head of the Folk Music\r\nArchives of the Library of Congress at age 20, Alan has devoted his life\r\nto the preservation and study of international folk music. Following the\r\nfootsteps of his late father, musicologist John Lomax, Alan has taken his\r\nrecording equipment to six continents in search of the rapidly disappearing\r\nmusical treasures of the world.\r\n\r\nI finally caught up with Alan and met him for an interview on a Friday\r\nevening at his office/apartment on West 98th Street. One room, I\r\nobserved, was lined wall to wall with tapes and record albums. Another\r\nwas filled with music books, a third with computer readouts, and a fourth\r\nwith movie films.\r\n\r\nAlan's foremost interest right now is cantometrics -- the science of song\r\nas a measure of culture. Recently he published a book titled\r\n_Cantometrics: A Method in Musical Anthropology_. Accompanying the\r\nvolume are seven cassette tapes. The songs are arranged in an order that\r\nwill teach the student to interpret their general meaning without knowing\r\nthe language.\r\n\r\n\"When you learn the system, you can understand any music,\" said Alan.\r\n\"We analyzed 4000 songs from 400 societies around the world. Out of\r\nthat study has come a map of world music.\" He then showed me a\r\nmusical chart of Europe, the Far East, and Indian North America. Thirty\r\nseven aspects of the music, including rhythm, volume and repetition, had\r\nbeen analyzed by a computer to make a graph.\r\n\r\n\"Each aspect of the music,\" said Alan, \"stands for a different social style.\r\nIt's like the guy who says, 'I don't know anything about music, but I\r\nknow what I like.' It means that kind of music stands for his background\r\nand what he believes in.\"\r\n\r\nAlan played a tape for me containing a Spanish folk song, an Irish jig and\r\na song from Nepal, explaining some of the elements as the music was\r\nplaying. \"By the time you've heard two or three tapes,\" he said, \"you get\r\nused to the world standards of music. In primitive societies, he added,\r\n\"everybody knows the same things about everything, so being specific is\r\na bore, and repetition is what they like. You don't impose your boring\r\naccuracy on everyone. By the same token, primitive people find it much\r\neasier to sing together than, for example, New Yorkers of different\r\nbackgrounds. In the latter case,\" said Alan, \"everybody starts singing at\r\na different tempo, like six cats in a bag. But if you take people who live\r\ntogether and work together, it's like clouds rolling out of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nAlan was not impressed with the 1976 movie _Bound for Glory_, about\r\nthe life of American folk singer/songwriter Woody Guthrie during the\r\nGreat Depression. The movie ends with Woody leaving Hollywood for\r\nNew York to perform in a coast-to-coast radio show. The man who hosted\r\nthat show was Alan Lomax.\r\n\r\n\"We collaborated on a number of things,\" recalled Alan. \"It was an\r\nenormous pleasure. He was the funniest man that ever talked. And he was\r\nso quick. That's what was wrong with the movie. Talking with Woody\r\nwas like playing a game of jai alai. He was a deeply passionate person,\r\nand tremendously gifted. He got up in the morning and wrote 25 pages\r\nbefore breakfast just to warm up.\"\r\n\r\nThough Alan can sing and play the guitar, he does not regard himself as\r\na performer but rather as a \"funnel\" for other musicians. During the 1940s\r\nhe helped launch the careers of people like Burl Ives and Pete Seeger by\r\nproviding them with songs and putting them on the radio. \"We set out to\r\nrevive the American folk music in 1938, and by God we did it,\" said\r\nAlan. \"By 1950 it was a national movement.\"\r\n\r\nAlan spent the next 10 years of his life in Europe, where he produced a\r\ndefinitive 14-album collection of international folk music. Then he moved\r\nback to the U.S. and settled on the Upper West Side, where he has lived\r\nfor the past 15 years. His residential apartment is located two blocks from\r\nhis office.\r\n\r\nBesides his research in cantometrics, done in cooperation with Columbia\r\nUniversity, Alan is now preparing for publication a study on international\r\ndance movement and its relations to society. Energetic, jovial, and looking\r\nconsiderably younger than his years, Alan has no doubts about the lasting\r\nvalue of his work.\r\n\r\n\"I make my living as a very hard-working scientist,\" he said. \"By using\r\nscientific methods, I can absolutely refute the ideas of those who say that\r\nOklahoma doesn't matter, or that the Pygmies might as well be\r\nexterminated. Each of these people, we have found, has something for the\r\nhuman future, for the human destiny.\"\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe Mighty Lomax\r\n\r\nfrom _The Westsider_, late 1977\r\n\r\nIt's oldies night on the radio. The d.j. has promised to play nothing but\r\nthe greatest hits of the '50s and '60s, and sure enough, here they are --\r\n\"Irene Goodnight\" sung by the Weavers; \"Tom Dooley\" by the Kingston\r\nTrio; \"Abilene\" by George Hamilton IV; \"Midnight Special\" by Johnny\r\nRivers; and \"House of the Rising Sun\" by the Animals.\r\n\r\nAll of these songs reached number one on the charts. And they have\r\nsomething else in common: all are genuine American folk songs of\r\nunknown authorship that might have been lost forever if they had not been\r\ndiscovered and preserved by John and Alan Lomax, the famous father-son\r\nfolklorist team.\r\n\r\nThe folk music explosion in America that peaked in the early 1960s and\r\ncontinues today owes more of a debt to the Lomaxes than to any\r\nperformer or songwriter. John Lomax died in 1948 at the age of 80. His\r\nson Alan, 62, has been a resident of New York's Upper West Side for the\r\npast 15 years. Working seven days a week at his 98th Street office and his\r\n100th Street apartment, Alan has carried on his father's work with a\r\nremarkable talent and energy. He has gone far beyond the simple\r\ncollecting of folk songs, and maintains a dizzying schedule of activities --\r\nwriting books, catching planes for Europe or Africa, making movies,\r\nproducing record albums and tapes, and heading a musical research\r\nproject for the Anthropology Department of Columbia University.\r\n\r\nFathers and Sons\r\n\r\nThe elder Lomax was primarily a songhunter. His first collection,\r\n_Cowboy Songs_, was published in 1910. It contained such gems as \"John\r\nHenry,\" \"Shenandoah\" and \"Home on the Range,\" which he heard for the\r\nfirst time in the back of a saloon in the Negro red light district of San\r\nAntonio.\r\n\r\nAlan was born in Texas in 1915. When he was 13 years old his father\r\ngave him an old-fashioned cylinder recording machine, and the boy was\r\nhooked. He became a full-time song scholar at 18. In that same year his\r\nfather was put in charge of the newly created Archives of American Folk\r\nSong at the Library of Congress in Washington. When Alan was 20 he\r\ntook over as archives director. The father-son team eventually provided\r\nmore than half of the 20,000 songs in the collection.\r\n\r\nThe Lomaxes wrote many books together; they introduced American folk\r\nmusic into the nation's public schools, and through their radio programs\r\nin the U.S. and Europe, made celebrities out of such performers as Burl\r\nIves, Pete Seeger, Leadbelly and Woody Guthrie.\r\n\r\nWhereas John Lomax was interested in the music for its own sake, Alan\r\nbegan some time ago to look for the deeper meaning, or social\r\nsignificance, of folk songs. In his many trips around the world he built up\r\na collection of recordings from every continent and virtually every major\r\nculture. Along with a co-worker he developed his findings into the new\r\nbranch of anthropology known as cantometrics.\r\n\r\nWhen the Voyager 2 spacecraft left Earth last August for a journey\r\nbeyond the solar system, it carried on its side a unique record player with\r\na specially made disk for alien beings to hear and enjoy. The disk\r\ncontained 27 musical selections, which have been named \"Earth's Greatest\r\nHits\"; 13 of them were chosen by Alan Lomax.\r\n\r\nThe following interview was conducted in various rooms of Alan's office\r\non a Friday evening in August, 1977. One room was filled with recording\r\nequipment, tapes and records; another with music books; a third with\r\ncomputer readouts; and a fourth with movie films. Lomax spoke rapidly\r\nand found it difficult to sit still. He is not a neat housekeeper, a sharp\r\ndresser or a master of the social graces. He is, however, a tireless worker\r\nwho gives the impression of being totally absorbed in his work. A large,\r\nrobust man, he will no doubt continue to be a major figure in the field of\r\ninternational folk music for years to come.\r\n\r\nQuestion: What exactly is cantometrics?\r\n\r\nAnswer: It means, literally, singing as a measure of culture. With it, a\r\nsong performance may be analyzed and related to a culture pattern. Each\r\naspect of music stands for a different social style. By using cantometrics\r\nyou get the story of mankind in musical terms. ... It's like the guy who\r\nsays, \"I don't know anything about music but I know what I like.\" It\r\nmeans that kind of music stands for his background and what he believes\r\nin.\r\n\r\nQ:        How did you develop this new science?\r\n\r\nA:        I started this project in 1961. ... We analyzed 4,000 songs on a\r\ncomputer. Out of that has come a map of world culture. There are 10 big\r\ngroups or styles of music. Stone age people have style 1. ... We found\r\nthere's a similarity of Patagonian music and Siberian, even though these\r\npeople live near the opposite poles. ... Along with studying song, we have\r\nalso studied dance and conversation in the same way, from film. I\r\nprobably have the biggest collection of dance film in the world -- 200,000\r\nfeet. Maybe the New York Public Library has more, but that's specialized\r\nin fine art.\r\n\r\nQ:        What's the purpose of cantometrics? How can someone learn it?\r\n\r\nA:        I recently published a set of seven cassette tapes of folk songs from\r\nall 10 cultural levels around the world. In the booklet that comes with it,\r\nthe songs are broken down and analyzed so that the student can learn the\r\ncantometrics system on his own. When you learn the system, you can\r\nunderstand any music, even if you don't know the language it's being\r\nsung in. By the time you've heard two or three tapes, you get used to the\r\nworld standard of music. Cantometrics measures things like repetition,\r\nornamentation, rhythm, melody, orchestral arrangement. ... It analyzes\r\nmusic in relation to social structure -- political organization, community\r\nsolidarity, severity of sexual sanctions. Cantometrics makes the world's\r\nmusic into a geography.\r\n\r\nQ:        How does American music differ from that of the world in general?\r\n\r\nA:        In our culture, for example, we didn't have much repetition until rock\r\nand roll came around. And that represents another influence. ... As you\r\nknow, we of European background don't sing very well together.\r\nEverybody starts singing at a different tempo, like seven cats in a bag. But\r\nif you take people who live and work together, it's like clouds rolling out\r\nof the sea. ... It turns out that the people with the most repetition in their\r\nsongs have the most primitive cultures -- at least, in relation to their\r\neconomic development. Everybody knows the same thing about\r\neverything. So being specific is boring, and repetition is what they like.\r\nYou don't impose your boring accuracy on everyone.\r\n\r\nQ:        What do you consider the real beginning of the folk music movement\r\nin America?\r\n\r\nA:        It all began in Texas in 1885 when my father heard \"Whoopee Ti Yi\r\nYo\" on the Chisholm Trail. He was a country boy. He grew up in Texas,\r\nand the cowboys drifted past. He wrote the songs down just for the hell\r\nof it. Then he got a grant from Harvard and found out how important it\r\nwas. He was the first person in the country to use a recording device, in\r\n1902.\r\n\r\nQ:        Did you know Woody Guthrie very well?\r\n\r\nA:        Know him? I made him famous. I had a coast-to-coast radio program\r\nwhen Woody first came to New York. I introduced him when he first sang\r\non radio. He stayed at my house. ... They offered him a huge contract,\r\nbut he just walked off and went to Oklahoma. He was a deeply passionate\r\nperson, and tremendously gifted. First of all he was the funniest man that\r\never talked. And Woody was so quick: talking to him was like playing jai\r\nalai. He got up in the morning and wrote 25 pages before breakfast just\r\nto warm up. And there was always a slightly strange thing about woody\r\n-- an itchy feeling that he had. It might have been beginning of the disease\r\nwhich later killed him.\r\n\r\nQ:        What's your connection with Pete Seeger?\r\n\r\nA:        Peter Seeger is my protege. I gave him his banjo. The banjo was a\r\ndead issue, and he came to me and asked what he should do with his life.\r\nHe was a Harvard hippie. ... We got to be colleagues. We worked on the\r\nwhole revival of the American folk music. I taught him most of his early\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\nQ:        Were you ever a performer yourself?\r\n\r\nA:        Yes, I've made a few records. But I was always more of a funnel. I\r\nregarded myself as a dredge, dredging up the rich subsoil of American\r\nfolk and putting it back on the developing music scene. We set out to\r\nrevive the American folk music in 1938, and by God we did it. By 1950\r\nit was a national movement.\r\n\r\nQ:        What are some other things you've done?\r\n\r\nA:        I did the first oral history -- the Leadbelly book and the book on Jelly\r\nRoll Morton. The Leadbelly movie (1976) was taken from that oral\r\nhistory. For Jelly Roll Morton, I transcribed the tape and made it into a\r\npiece of literature. The story has been bought for a movie by the same\r\npeople who made the Woody Guthrie movie, _Bound for Glory_.\r\n\r\nQ:        Have you done a lot of research outside the United States?\r\n\r\nA:        Yes, I spent 1950 to 1960 in Europe assembling all the best material\r\nthat had been collected into 14 albums, geographically arranged. Then I\r\nstarted thinking about what I heard on albums -- not what musicians or\r\nliterary people heard, but what I heard. Then I met some people at the\r\nNational Institute of Mental Health who were interested in the norms of\r\nhealthy behavior. I indicated to them that I was that getting at the behavior\r\nstyles of the people of the world. They gave me some dough and I got a\r\nstaff together.\r\n\r\nQ: How was the American folk music scene then?\r\n\r\nA: I was very shocked when I came back to the United States in 1960.\r\nThe musical scene at Washington Square made me sick. They said, \"Alan,\r\nthose people you talked to are all dead.\" I kind of withdrew from the\r\nwhole business. ... Later I set up a concert in Carnegie Hall and brought\r\nin the first bluegrass group and the first gospel group to perform in New\r\nYork. People stormed the stage. There were fistfights and everything.\r\nWell, that was the whole end of people saying New York was the center\r\nof the folk scene.\r\n\r\nQ:        What do you think of Bob Dylan?\r\n\r\nA:        Dylan came along in the footsteps of Ramblin' Jack Elliott. He lived\r\nwith Woody for a while, and picked him as his model. He absorbed the\r\nwhole southwestern style from Woody. And the country for the first time\r\nfell for a national American vocal style. Then Dylan left the scene and\r\nwent middle class after three years. He turned his back on folk music,\r\nturned his back on people. I think he did a big disservice to the country\r\nwhen he did that. ... The whole thing has been to make urban mobile\r\npeople have a folk music of their own. It's not a bad idea. Terribly boring\r\nthough.\r\n\r\nQ:        Do all your projects lead to one goal?\r\n\r\nA:        I make my living as a very hardworking scientist. I do that because\r\nit was important finally to take this huge world that was coming out of\r\nloudspeakers, and get down to the meat of it so that it can be used for the\r\nbetterment of our future ... so that we can keep all the treasures of the\r\npast and use them. That's what I'm doing. I'm doing it in a scientific way\r\nso that I can absolutely refute the idea of those who say that Oklahoma\r\ndoesn't matter, or that the Pygmies might as well be exterminated. Each\r\nof these people, we have found, has something for the human future, and\r\nfor the human destiny.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER PETER MAAS\r\nAuthor of _Serpico_ and _Made in America_\r\n\r\n1-12-80\r\n\r\nOn the surface, his life could hardly be calmer. Peter Maas gets up every\r\nmorning to have breakfast with his 12-year-old son, then heads for his\r\nmidtown office, where he spends about five hours at the typewriter. He\r\nrarely goes out in the evening, and his idea of fun is a weekend of fishing,\r\na set of tennis or a game of backgammon. \"I don't have to live in New\r\nYork,\" he says. \"When I'm working on a book, I might as well be living\r\nin the wilds of Maine.\"\r\n\r\nBut in his mind, Peter Maas leads the life of James Bond and Al Capone\r\nrolled into one. \"I know an awful lot of people on both sides of the law,\"\r\nsays the author of two nonfiction block-busters about crime, _The Valachi\r\nPapers_ and _Serpico_. _The Valachi Papers_, the real-life saga of three\r\ngenerations of a Mafia chieftain's family, was published in 1969 following\r\ntwo years of court battles and rejections from 26 publishers who felt that\r\nbooks on the Mafia had no commercial potential. It sold three million\r\ncopies in 14 languages and paved the way for an entire industry of Mafia\r\nbooks and movies.\r\n\r\n_Serpico_ (1973) revealed the rampant corruption in the New York City\r\nPolice Department through the eyes of officer Frank Serpico. Then came\r\n_King of the Gypsies_ (1975), Maas' third expose of the underbelly of\r\nAmerican society which, like the others, was made into a successful\r\nmovie.\r\n\r\nNow the 50-year-old author has written his first novel, _Made in\r\nAmerica_. Published in September by Viking, it is a raw, violent, grimly\r\nhumorous story of an ex-football star for the New York Giants who gets\r\nmixed up with organized crime while borrowing money for a shady\r\ninvestment scheme. King Kong Karpstein, the terrifying loan shark who\r\ndominates the book, is based on several people whom Maas had known\r\npersonally, and the novel's head Mafia character has much in common\r\nwith Frank Costello, the \"prime minister of the underworld,\" who granted\r\nMaas 11 interviews shortly before his death in 1975. The scenes of _Made\r\nIn America_ -- porn parlors, criminal hideaways, the FBI offices -- are all\r\ndescribed with the same intense realism as the characters. The movie\r\nrights have been sold for $450,000.\r\n\r\n\"The reason I wrote it,\" explains Maas, sitting restlessly at his 11-room\r\nEastside apartment on a recent afternoon, \"was that I didn't want to wake\r\nup 10 years from now wondering what would have happened if I had\r\nwritten a novel. ... I also think a writer has to challenge himself\r\nconstantly. I don't think he should play a pat hand.\"\r\n\r\nAs he talks on in his breezy New York accent, fidgeting with a gold\r\nmatchbox on the antique table beside him, Maas seems barely able to\r\nrestrain himself from getting up and pacing the room. Quite striking in\r\nappearance, he is a tall, stocky man with a Brillo-pad thatch of silvery\r\nhair and eyebrows like cotton batting. A native Manhattanite, he was one\r\nof the country's top investigative reporters for many years before writing\r\nhis first book, _The Rescuer_, in 1967.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the title _Made In America_, says Maas is that \"the events\r\nin the novel could only happen in America. ... One of the themes is that\r\nnobody in the book, including the football player and the federal\r\nprosecutor, thinks that he's doing anything wrong. So that's a very\r\nprofound kind of corruption.\"\r\n\r\nLike his previous books, _Made in America_ took two years to write.\r\n\"The biggest difference that I found,\" he points out, \"was that in\r\nnonfiction, all the discoveries and surprises are in the research, and in\r\nfiction, they're all in the writing. When I write nonfiction, about two\r\nthirds of the time is spent in research. I didn't do any research for this.\r\nIt was much harder. And it was the only time I had to rewrite the whole\r\nbook.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Maas claims that his own life has never been in imminent\r\ndanger, he was touched by deep personal tragedy in 1975 when his wife,\r\na highly talented writer/producer named Audrey Gellen, was killed in an\r\nautomobile accident. Their only child, John Michael, is a skilled pianist.\r\n\r\nPuffing on an imported little cigar, Maas speaks with pride of some of his\r\nmost important stories in the past. An article he wrote in 1960 led to the\r\nrelease of Edgar Labat, a black convict in Louisiana who had been on\r\ndeath row for 11 years. An article about columnist Igor Cassini in 1963\r\nresulted in Cassini's arrest and conviction as a secret agent for Dominican\r\nstrongman Trujillo. The biggest story Maas never wrote was a book about\r\nthe shah of Iran; several years ago he turned down an offer of $1 million\r\nfor the project in order to concentrate on his novel.\r\n\r\n\"I've always had trouble writing about women,\" he confesses when asked\r\nabout future books. \"So the main character of my next work will be a\r\nwoman. It was going to be another novel, but now I've run across what\r\nI think is a fantastic nonfiction project, which I'm mostly interested in\r\nbecause the subject matter is a woman. So I think I'll do that first and the\r\nnovel afterward. At least I know what my next two will be, and that's\r\ncomforting.\"\r\n\r\ndied 8-23-01. born 6-27-29. Auth\r\nor of _Serpico_ and _The Terrible Hours_.\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LEONARD MALTIN\r\nFilm historian and critic\r\n\r\n9-2-78\r\n\r\nMost people who opt for a writing career do not expect to accomplish\r\nmuch before the age of 30. But Leonard Maltin, a 27-year-old Westsider,\r\nbreaks all the rules. His book _The Great Movie Comedians: From\r\nCharlie Chaplin to Woody Allen_, published in June by Crown Press, is\r\nthe 30th volume to bear his name on the jacket. One of America's\r\nforemost film historians, he has written nine books and edited 21 others,\r\nwhile contributing articles to such publications as _TV Guide_, _Esquire_\r\nand the _New York Times_.\r\n\r\n_The Great Movie Comedians_ is one of his most ambitious projects to\r\ndate. In 240 pages of text and more than 200 photographs, the author\r\nanalyzes the careers of 22 comic stars from the days of silent film to the\r\n1970s. Sales have been brisk so far. The book is already in its second\r\nprinting and has been picked up by the Nostalgia Book Club.\r\n\r\nLeonard was born on the West Side, moved to New Jersey at the age of\r\n4, and became hooked on old movies by the time he was 8. At 13, he\r\nbegan to write for a magazine called _Film Fan Monthly_. Two years\r\nlater, he took over as editor and publisher -- a job he continued for nine\r\nyears. His work with the magazine led to his first book contract in 1968\r\n-- a thick paperback titled _TV Movies_ with summaries of thousands of\r\nfilms. The third edition is coming out this fall.\r\n\r\nIn 1975, when Leonard got married, he and his wife Alice moved to the\r\nWest Side. She, too, is a film buff; their favorite Westside movie theatre\r\nis the Regency (Broadway at 67th).\r\n\r\nLeonard's literary career has never been in better shape than now. Two\r\nof his other books will appear in new editions this fall. And the 10th book\r\nthat he has authored, a comprehensive history of American animated\r\ncartoons treated _Of Mice and Magic_, will be published next year by\r\nSignet.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JEAN MARSH\r\nCreator and star of _Upstairs, Downstairs_\r\n\r\n2-10-79\r\n\r\n_Upstairs, Downstairs_, the saga of a wealthy London family and its staff\r\nof servants in the early years of the 20th century, is one of the most\r\npopular television series ever filmed. The first episode of the British-made\r\nseries was released in England in 1971, and since that time more than one\r\nbillion people in 40 countries have watched the exploits of the Bellamy\r\nfamily. Introduced to American public television in 1974, _Upstairs,\r\nDownstairs_ won seven Emmy Awards, including one for Best Series each\r\nyear it was shown.\r\n\r\nIf any single performer could be said to stand out over all the others, that\r\nwould be Jean marsh, who received an Emmy for Best Actress for her\r\nportrayal of Rose, the head parlormaid. But what most of Marsh's\r\nAmerican fans fail to realize is that, with her, without would be no\r\n_Upstairs, Downstairs_: she co-created the show with another British\r\nactress. A New Yorker on and off for the past two decades, Jean Marsh\r\nnow lives in an apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It is here that\r\nI meet her to talk about _Upstairs, Downstairs_, which returned to\r\nAmerican television in January with 39 hour-long segments, eight of\r\nwhich have never been seen before on this side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes it drives me crazy that nobody ever speaks to me about\r\nanything else,\" says Jean, a slender, pretty, soft-spoken woman who has\r\nthe knack of putting visitors immediately at their ease with her charm and\r\nlack of pretension. \"I start to drivel after a while, because I tell how I\r\ndevised _Upstairs, Downstairs_ and how the cast was chosen.\" There is\r\nno irritation in her voice, only humor. With her lively eyes and childlike\r\nappearance, she is reminiscent of Peter Pan.\r\n\r\n_Upstairs, Downstairs_, says Jean, \"didn't spring new-minted. My friend\r\nEileen Atkins and I had been talking about trying to devise a television\r\nseries. We thought we should write something we knew about -- about our\r\npasts. And it became servants more than anything else, because her father\r\nhad been a butler. She was showing me pictures of her family one day;\r\nshe had photographs of servants going to a pub in a horse-drawn bus. So\r\nthe first thing we wrote about was servants going on an outing. And later\r\nwe decided it wouldn't be nearly as interesting unless we included the\r\npeople upstairs.\"\r\n\r\nJean herself was born in a poor section of London, the daughter of a\r\nlaborer and a barmaid. From her earliest years she aimed for a show\r\nbusiness career as the surest route out of her social class. She began as a\r\ndancer -- \"I could teach classical ballet or tap if I wanted now\" -- and\r\ndanced in stage productions and films from the age of 7 until she gave it\r\nup at 20. As an actress, she became an instant success at 15 when she\r\nplayed the role of a cat opposite one of England's leading comic actors.\r\n\"The play opened, and I stole the review,\" recalls Jean with a grin. \"It\r\nwas a regional theatre, and they asked me to stay in their company. It was\r\na peak of happiness in my life. There was no time to think of money or\r\nboys or clothes or anything -- just work.\"\r\n\r\nHer Broadway debut took place more than two decades ago, and over the\r\nyears she has dazzled British and American audiences in an endless\r\nnumber of plays and movies. Classical theatre is her specialty; Jean\r\nrecently completed a tour of American regional theatres with plays by\r\nShakespeare, Shaw and Oscar Wilde.\r\n\r\n\"Regional theatres are usually more professional than Broadway. I\r\ncouldn't do _Twelfth Night_ on Broadway, but I can do it on the road and\r\nmake money,\" she says of her favorite Shakespearean play. \"At one\r\nperformance, I was playing in britches and split them, and I managed to\r\nmake up a rhymed couplet. Somebody came backstage and said, 'How can\r\nyou split your britches at exactly the same time every night?'\"\r\n\r\nHer current project is a film titled _The Changeling_ with George C.\r\nScott. \"I leave for Canada next week to do the exteriors. I'm going to get\r\ncrushed to death in the snow. I play George's wife. My role is over very\r\nquickly, but then I appear in flashback soon afterward. It's a ghost/murder\r\nmystery. My death makes him susceptible to phenomena.\" Asked about\r\nScott, she says, \"I've known him for about 20 years. I think he's a dear.\r\nHis image seems to be spiky and alarming. People say, 'How can you get\r\nalong with him?' But I think he's like a teddy bear. He's adorable. Rather\r\nshy, too.\"\r\n\r\nMarried and divorced at an early age, Jean now lives alone and likes it.\r\nShe acquired her Eastside apartment a year ago but has been unable to\r\nspend more than six weeks in it so far, due to her extensive travel. \"I go\r\nout and get the bread and newspaper in my pajamas,\" she says.\r\n\r\nJean explains her amazingly youthful appearance by saying, \"I'm very\r\nyoung in my head. I'm quite daft; I'm sillier than most people I know. I\r\nbelieve in God, and I believe you should lead a good life. ... One thing\r\nI'm one hundred percent for is ecology. I'm so anxious that we don't\r\nbequeath the next generation with an ugly world. I'd like them to go on\r\nthe walks I have had, and breathe the air I have breathed.\"\r\n\r\n_Elliott_.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER JACKIE MASON\r\nCo-starring with Steve Martin in _The Jerk_\r\n\r\n12-8-79\r\n\r\nJackie Mason admits that the most famous thing he ever did was to be\r\ncaught with one of his fingers pointing upwards on the _Ed Sullivan\r\nShow_. \"The most famous and the least helpful,\" he says of the 1964\r\nincident. \"At that time there was a great wave of excitement about my\r\ntype of character, because I was new and fresh and different. In those\r\ndays, every comedian talked like an American; nobody talked like a Jew\r\nor a Puerto Rican or an Italian. ... There was a lot of heat to give me my\r\nown series, but all the offers were canceled after that incident.\"\r\n\r\nAsked whether he actually did make an obscene gesture, the short, stocky\r\ncomedian with the broad New York Jewish accent shakes his curly head.\r\n\"The truth is that I didn't -- because I wouldn't be ashamed to tell you if\r\nI did. There's nothing wrong with it today. But the truth is that I was\r\nmaking with my fingers -- I have a very visual act, you know -- and\r\nSullivan got panicky because President Johnson had just cut into the\r\nprogram, and when the camera came back on me, it looked like I was\r\ngiving him some kind of message. The next day, I became headlines all\r\nover the world. ... I maintained enough success and enough imagery to be\r\nable to do all the other shows as a guest, but the sponsors were afraid to\r\nbe associated with me as the star.\"\r\n\r\nJackie is telling me this in his dressing room at Dangerfield's (1118 First\r\nAvenue), where he's performing six nights a week until December 17.\r\nThe affable Mason is quick to defend his caustic brand of ethnic humor.\r\n\"I don't see how it can be harmful. If people do feel any prejudice, it\r\nprovides an outlet for them to be able to laugh at it. The people who\r\ndecry ethnic humor are afraid of their own prejudice. You remind them\r\nof the ridiculous nature of prejudice. ... Most of the things I say are\r\nuniversal: they're about marriage, about minorities, about social problems\r\n-- the issues of the day.\"\r\n\r\nHe also pokes fun at doctors, weathermen and every profession in\r\nbetween. Then there are his highly exaggerated impressions of Menachem\r\nBegin, Jimmy Carter and Ed Sullivan (\"He always asked me to do an\r\nimpression of him on his show. He found out from me how to do\r\n_him_.\"). Another of his ploys is to razz the audience members. \"In 21\r\nyears,\" he said, \"I only had one incident where a guy got mad and wanted\r\nto punch me in the mouth. Thank God I move very fast. He wanted to kill\r\nme. Obviously he didn't catch me. That's why I'm still here for the\r\ninterview.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, he was raised in New York's Lower East\r\nSide from the age of 5. Following in the footsteps of three older brothers,\r\nhe studied to become a rabbi to please his father. \"I knew it wasn't for\r\nme. I have all license to be a rabbi, but I'm not a rabbi.\" A bachelor and\r\nEastside resident, he loves New York because \"this is a melting pot that\r\ndoesn't really melt. There's a pot, but it's full of unmelted people.\"\r\n\r\nDangerfield's, he says, is the only club in New York where major\r\ncomedians still perform. \"Seven, eight, nine years ago, there was about\r\n12 clubs that played comedians. There was the Copacabana, the Waldorf\r\nAstoria, the Latin Quarter, the Plaza: all those rooms were wiped out.\"\r\nConsequently, Jackie does a lot of performing in such clubs as the Riviera\r\nin Las Vegas and the Fontainebleau in Miami. Nowadays, however, he's\r\nmore interested in making movies. His first one, directed by John Avelson\r\nof _Rocky_ fame, was \"a big success without anybody seeing it.\" His\r\nsecond film, _The Jerk_, is now being heavily promoted for its December\r\n14 opening. Also starring Steve Martin, Bernadette Peters and Catlin\r\nAdams, it is about a poor black sharecropper's adopted son (Martin) who\r\nleaves home and begins wandering on the road until he ends up at the gas\r\nstation of Harry Hartounian, played by Mason.\r\n\r\n\"He's an uneducated kid who doesn't know anything,\" explains Jackie.\r\n\"He doesn't know how to handle himself, how to talk, how to act. I give\r\nhim a part-time job at my place, and I give him a room. He doesn't know\r\nwhat a job is, and he doesn't understand that you get paid. He never saw\r\nmoney. He thinks you're supposed to eat it. He's a crazy lost kid and I\r\nplay the father figure.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 20, Jackie will appear on the _Merv Griffin Show_ with\r\nSteve Martin and Carl Reiner, the movie's director.\r\n\r\nJackie loves being a comedian because \"I'm my own boss and I do what\r\nI like ... When young comics say it's a hard business to enter, it's because\r\nthey have no talent. If a young comic has talent, he's more likely to make\r\na big living than in any business you can think of, with comparatively less\r\neffort, and more opportunity, and greater longevity. I never saw a good\r\ncomedian in this business who hasn't made a comfortable living at it.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MALACHY McCOURT\r\nActor and social critic\r\n\r\n9-22-79\r\n\r\n\"I never take anything seriously -- least of all myself,\" says Malachy\r\nMcCourt, one of the wittiest, most outrageous Irish personalities in New\r\nYork. \"I find my life is cyclical, and so I move every five or six years\r\nfrom one interest to another. Now that I'm doing acting sort of full-time,\r\nI thoroughly enjoy the uncertainty of it. But I do appear almost also every\r\nWednesday at the unemployment office at 90th Street. I do a matinee from\r\n2:15 to 2:45.\"\r\n\r\nHe concludes the remarks with his customary gust of laughter. As\r\nopinionated as he is entertaining, Malachy McCourt is one of those larger\r\nthan-life characters who has mastered the art of conversation to such a\r\ndegree that no matter what people think of him, they cannot help being\r\nmagnetically attracted by his words.\r\n\r\nIn 1968 he had his own talk show in WOR-TV that was canceled because\r\nof the controversy it raised. From 1970 to 1976 he had a weekend show\r\non WMCA radio, and lost that as well -- for publicly condemning the\r\nstation's treatment of an employee whose job was abolished. \"They called\r\nhim in on a Friday at five minutes to five, and told him to clear his desk.\r\nHe had been there for 28 years.\"\r\n\r\nThe airwaves' loss has been the theatre's gain, because in the past three\r\nyears, Malachy has developed an ever-increasing reputation as a character\r\nactor. Well-known for his roles in Irish plays -- especially those by John\r\nMillington Synge -- he has also been seen recently in movies and\r\ntelevision. His films include _Two for the Seesaw_ and _The Brink's\r\nJob_, while on television, he appeared in last season's _The Dain Curse_\r\nwith James Coburn and in Thomas Wolfe's _You Can't Go Home Again_.\r\n\r\nHis current vehicle is _The Shadow of a Gunman_ by Sean O'Casey, the\r\ngreat Irish playwright. In the role of Seamus Shields, whom Malachy\r\ndescribes as \"a snivelling, sycophantic swine of a braggart,\" he is co\r\nstarring with Stephen Lang at the Off-Off Broadway Symphony Space for\r\nthe Performing Arts, 95th Street and Broadway.\r\n\r\nThe action takes place in Dublin in 1920. \"It was during the time of what\r\nthey euphemistically call 'the Troubles,'\" explains Malachy in his broad,\r\nbreezy irish accent. We're sitting in his Westside living room. The walls\r\nare so loaded down with books that they seem ready to collapse. \"The\r\nEnglish brought in a bunch of gangsters from their prisons, called the\r\nBlack and Tans. They were paid an extraordinary amount of money to go\r\nover and pacify the country. They could do anything they pleased. You\r\ncould be tortured, raped and robbed.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Limerick in 1931, Malachy quit school at the age of 12. \"It was\r\nan equal struggle. They couldn't teach me and I couldn't learn.\" He joined\r\nthe Irish Army at 14, was kicked out at 15, then went to England, where\r\nhe worked as a laborer prior to emigrating to the U.S. at the age of 20.\r\nHis conversational brilliance soon made him famous as a saloon keeper.\r\nAt one time he ran a Malachy's and a Malachy's II on the Upper East\r\nSide. \"I gave it up,\" he quips, \"for the sake of the wife and the kidneys.\"\r\nNow the only bartending he does is on the ABC soap opera _Ryan's\r\nHope_, where he is a regular. \"I much prefer that. It's a fake bar, and\r\neverybody else cleans it up.\"\r\n\r\nHe has few happy memories of his native country. \"There should not be\r\na united Ireland,\" he asserts. \"In the South, the government is subject to\r\nenormous pressures by the church all the time, in the areas of birth\r\ncontrol, contraception, abortion. People should have the rights to their\r\nown bodies and their own lives. ... Consequently, those of us who escape\r\nget very savage about it. Very savage.\r\n\r\n\"Someone I was talking to the other day said, 'I can't understand how you\r\ncan be an atheist and have of fear of death.' I said, 'I have no fear of\r\ndeath because I grew up with it.' It was all around. I woke up one\r\nmorning when I was 5 and a half to find my brother dead beside me.\r\nAnother brother had died six months before. My sister died in her crib.\r\nSo therefore, what can you fear, when you know it so well? I'm alive\r\ntoday. I'll probably get up tomorrow. There's great comfort in the fact\r\nthat we're all going to die eventually.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about Daniel P. Moynihan, whom he somewhat resembles\r\nphysically, Malachy describes the senator as \"the Nureyev of politics. He\r\ncan leap from conservative crag to liberal crag with gay abandon. A man\r\nwho could serve Kennedy and compare Nixon to Disraeli must be either\r\ninsane or insanely clever. I look at him and I cannot believe that this\r\ntwinkly-eyed, overweight leprechaun can be so cunning.\"\r\n\r\nMalachy's wife Diana -- \"she's the only Smith graduate I know that\r\nbecame a carpenter\" -- does custom carpentry work out of a shop called\r\nSpace Constructs on 85th Street. Westsiders for two decades, the\r\nMcCourts have two children, Conor and Cormic. One of their favorite\r\nlocal restaurants is Los Panchos at 71st and Columbus; it is owned by\r\nMalachy's brother Alfie.\r\n\r\nAlthough Malachy has no desire to return to Ireland to live, he\r\nrecommends it for tourists because \"it's the last outpost of civilized\r\nconversation. The Irish have an attitude that when God made time, he\r\nmade plenty of it. So for God's sake, don't be rushing around. Stand there\r\nand talk to me.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MEAT LOAF\r\nHottest rock act in town\r\n\r\n10-21-78\r\n\r\nFor several years, up until last fall, Meat loaf lived in peaceful obscurity\r\nin an apartment at 25 West 74th Street. Few people outside of his own\r\ncircle knew that the name applied to a gargantuan 29-year-old singer from\r\nTexas and the rock band he headed.\r\n\r\nA couple of months ago, Meat returned to his old neighborhood after a\r\nlong absence. This time he caused a mob scene in the local supermarket,\r\nand, on escaping to his apartment, found people climbing on the window\r\nledges trying to catch a glimpse of him. The reason? His group's first\r\nalbum, _Bat Out Of Hell_, which has sold three million copies since its\r\nrelease a year ago.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to be rude to fans,\" says the calm, gentlemanly Meat Loaf\r\n(his legal name) during an interview at his new apartment in another part\r\nof the West Side. \"I'd lie down on the floor for hours so they couldn't see\r\nme. ... _People_ magazine printed my real name and told more or less\r\nwhere I lived: that's why I had to move.\"\r\n\r\nBare feet perched on the coffee table, he spreads his 275-pound, 6-foot\r\nframe evenly on the living room sofa. Although Meat's onstage image\r\nmakes him out to be one of rock's meanest and toughest characters, in\r\nperson he is totally devoid of arrogance, and in fact seems almost shy.\r\nSam Ellis, Meat Loaf's glib road manager who arranged the group's\r\nrecent trips to England, Germany, Canada and Australia, helps the\r\ninterview along by adding his comments whenever Meat begins to reach\r\nfor words.\r\n\r\nAll the songs on _Bat Out Of Hell_ -- raucous, earthy, and intense -- were\r\nwritten by fellow Westsider Jim Steinman, who plays keyboard with the\r\ngroup. After he and Meat Loaf met in 1973, they performed together\r\nfrequently, but their music met with limited success.\r\n\r\n\"People were afraid of it,\" says Meat. \"The songs were long. The voices\r\nwere loud. People in rock said it was too theatre. People in theatre said\r\nit was too rock and roll.\" When Meat and Jim were finally offered a\r\ncontract to do an album, Steinman went to work on some new material,\r\nand wrote nearly the entire contents of _Bat Out Of Hell_ in four months,\r\nincluding the gold singles _Two Out of Three Ain't Bad_ and _Paradise\r\nby the Dashboard Light_ -- a duet celebrating teen sexuality that has been\r\nchoreographed into an 8-minute show stopper by Meat and lead female\r\nvocalist Karla DeVito. \"Jim doesn't just write the songs and hand them to\r\nme. I do most of the vocal arrangements. It's really a team. It's like\r\nSonny and Cher,\" says the gargantuan singer.\r\n\r\nBrought up in Dallas under the name Marvin Lee Aday, he tipped the\r\nscales at 185 while in the fifth grade. \"I was an only child and my parents\r\nalways wanted two kids,\" he jokes. \"So they set two places at the dinner\r\ntable, and I ate both meals. ... I was always on the baseball team, because\r\nif they needed a base runner, they'd say, 'Go in there and get hit by the\r\nball.' I'd back up just enough so that I wouldn't get hurt.\"\r\n\r\nHe joined the high school choir in order to avoid study hall, and from\r\nthen on, singing became his main passion. After completing high school\r\nat 15, he travelled around with a number of bands. By the time he settled\r\ndown in New York, live rock music was no longer in so much demand as\r\nbefore. \"That's one reason I went into theatre,\" he remarks. \"Another\r\nreason was because someone hired me and I didn't have a job.\" As an\r\nsinger and actor, Meat performed in some 10 Broadway and Off\r\nBroadway productions, including _Hair_ and _The Rocky Horror Picture\r\nShow_, in which he also appeared in the 1975 film.\r\n\r\nWhen _Bat Out Of Hell_ was first released, it did not catch on\r\nimmediately. But soon a couple of influential radio stations in New York\r\nCity fell in love with it. Then Cleveland and Boston began to give it a lot\r\nof air time. From there, its reputation gathered momentum across the\r\ncountry. As a result of the slow start, _Bat Out Of Hell_ was still\r\nclimbing on the national charts nearly a year after it came out. In\r\nAustralia, it was the number one album for 10 straight weeks.\r\n\r\nThis past summer the Meat Loaf band did four sellout concerts in the New\r\nYork area in the space of a month. Now the band is taking it easy for a\r\nlittle while before returning to the studio for their second album. They\r\nplan to launch another world tour after the album is completed in March.\r\n\r\nMeat shares his apartment with 23-year-old Candy Darling, a slender,\r\npretty dancer/singer who will be performing in an upcoming Broadway\r\nmusical, _Whoopee!_ What does Meat Loaf like about the West Side? \"I\r\nhave absolutely no idea,\" he replies matter-of-factly. \"I can't stand it\r\nanywhere else.\" Among his preferred Westside hangouts: O'Neal's,\r\nGleason's, La Cantina, and Anita's Chili Parlor, all on Columbus Avenue\r\nbetween 71st and 73rd streets.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his meteoric rise to fame, Meat Loaf sees his overall career in\r\na different light then his fans. \"For me,\" he says thoughtfully, \"rock and\r\nroll is not an end. I'd like to make movies someday. I want to direct. I\r\nwant to produce. It's great to sell records, but this is not what I always\r\nwant to do. It's just another step on the mountain.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ANN MILLER\r\nCo-star of _Sugar Babies_\r\n\r\n1-12-80\r\n\r\n_Sugar Babies_, the rollicking burlesque musical that rolled into Broadway\r\nlast fall, was one of the most-awaited shows of the year because it\r\nsignalled Mickey Rooney's return to Broadway after umpteen years. Less\r\nattention was initially given to Mickey's co-star, dazzling Ann Miller, who\r\nlast appeared on Broadway in 1970 as a star of _Mame_. Ann, it turns\r\nout, is not only a wonderful singer and comedienne, but, in her mid-50s,\r\nis still one of the best tap dancers in America. Her fancy footwork has\r\nbecome a prime attraction of this box-office smash.\r\n\r\n\"I was also in _George White's Scandals_ for a year when I was 15,\"\r\nrecalls Ann in her dressing room after a performance. \"This is my third\r\nshow only.\" For most of her career, she has lived in Beverly Hills,\r\nCalifornia. The veteran of dozens of movies, including _On The Town_\r\nwith Frank Sinatra, Miss Miller is a larger-than-life entertainer who\r\nbelieves that her career comes first and foremost, ahead of personal\r\nhappiness and family. Married and divorced three times, she has no\r\nchildren, but is an ardent animal lover.\r\n\r\n\"I have two beautiful dogs, Cinderella and Jasmine,\" she says in a light\r\nSouthern accent. \"They look exactly alike, only one is Hungarian and the\r\nother is French. My secretary walks them. ... I'm very much interested\r\nin the protection of animals. I think people treat animals very cruelly, and\r\nto me, when you adopt a dog, it's like adopting a child. My little\r\nCinderella: she was thrown out of a car by somebody wanting to get rid\r\nof her. I found her in Cincinnati in a blizzard. She almost died and I\r\nsaved her life.\"\r\n\r\nBy looking beyond the heavy rouge, bright red lipstick, large rhinestone\r\nearrings and fluttering false eyelashes that are part of her act, one can see\r\nthat Ann appears considerably younger then her years. _Sugar Babies_,\r\nshe points out, is not burlesque in the normal sense. \"Burlesque got sleazy\r\nin the 1940s with bumps and grinds and tassel-twirlers, but that's not what\r\nwe're selling. We sell, in a sense, glorified, old-fashioned, 1920s-style\r\nvaudeville, with good production numbers. And that's what burlesque was\r\noriginally. ... A college professor got this together. The jokes are\r\nauthentic. ... Our show is for everybody. It's not dirty at all -- not by\r\ntoday's standards.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a crowd of people waiting to see Ann after nearly every show.\r\nRooney escapes the fans by dashing out the stage door within minutes of\r\nthe final curtain. \"He lives way out in New Jersey,\" explains Ann, who\r\nrents a hotel suite on the Upper West Side. \"Mickey is married and he has\r\n10 children. He loves them all very much. ... Mickey and I went to\r\nschool together. He's a very nice person and he's a great pro. He may be\r\na small man, but he's a giant in his own way.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Miller, who likes to dine at the 21 Club, Sardi's and the\r\nConservatory, believes that _Sugar Babies_ is a hit \"because it's timely.\r\nPeople are desperate to laugh. They're tired of hearing about war and the\r\nfood crunch and the oil crunch. They want to be entertained.\"\r\n\r\nShe has written her autobiography, _Miller's High Life_, which is\r\navailable \"only in rate bookstores and in every library in the country. It\r\nisn't out in paperback yet, but there's some talk of it.\" Asked about a\r\nprojected second volume, _Miller on Tap_, she says: \"It will be my life;\r\nit will carry on from where the other one left off.\"\r\n\r\nShe has no secret for looking so young, except that she is a nonsmoker,\r\ndrinks nothing stronger than wine, watches her diet, and avoids anything\r\nstrenuous in the daytime, to save her energy for the show.\r\n\r\nWith her jet-black hair, pearl-white teeth, and exaggerated makeup, Ann\r\nlooks more than a little exotic. This may help to explain her belief in\r\nreincarnation. \"I really do have memories of Egypt. They're not in a form\r\nthat I can describe. You sometimes just know things. You're born with\r\nknowing. I have been to Egypt three times, and I'm planning to go back\r\nagain and again, I want to go mainly to Luxor. I'm very entranced with\r\nit. I like all the antiquities of Egypt. The present-day Egypt I have no\r\ninterest in to speak of.\"\r\n\r\nAnn says she doesn't like the name of her current show. \"People think it's\r\ncandy, because there is Sugar Babies candy,\" she explains, \"but in the old\r\ndays, babies meant beautiful show girls. The girls had sugar daddies, so\r\nthey were called sugar babies.\"\r\n\r\nA Texas native who began dancing professionally in New York at the age\r\nof 11, Ann says yes, she feels good about her career, but that \"it's been\r\na long struggle. The sad part is, I have wanted so much to be happy, but\r\nI have never found happiness.\"\r\n\r\nHer father, who was a lawyer, left her mother when Ann was 10. Since\r\nMrs. Miller was almost totally deaf, Ann supported them by tap dancing\r\nat Rotary Club luncheons. She retains a fear of poverty to this day. \"I\r\nsave all my clothes because some day I might be poor again,\" she says.\r\n\"I have a room with nothing in it but racks of clothes. I cover them\r\nnicely, and once a year I air them out, in case they come back in style.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER SHERRILL MILNES\r\nOpera superstar\r\n\r\n2-24-79\r\n\r\n\"In a career of my size,\" says baritone Sherrill Milnes, \"there is no off\r\nseason. I try to hold myself to 60 performances a year -- not including\r\nrecordings or dress rehearsals or private studies. ... In fact, I think I'm\r\nthe most-recorded American opera singer ever, in any voice category.\"\r\n\r\nWe're talking in his spacious Westside apartment facing the Hudson\r\nRiver. I cannot help observing that Milnes, a handsome man who stands\r\n6 foot 2 and weighs 220 pounds, with his dark hair combed straight back\r\nand wearing a blue flowered shirt, looks very much like a country and\r\nwestern singer. It is his chest that gives him away -- a massive, powerful\r\nchest that hints at the huge voice it supports. To deliver notes that are\r\nclearly audible throughout the largest opera houses in the world, over the\r\nsound of a full orchestra, and without amplification, is one of the most\r\nphysically demanding tasks in all the performing arts. And one of the best\r\npaying. Only a handful of singers take home, like Milnes, approximately\r\n$7,000 for each night's work.\r\n\r\nAt 44, he is in the peak of his career, and has been since he made his\r\nMetropolitan Opera debut in December, 1965. He has sung in virtually all\r\nof the world's leading opera houses, including the Paris Opera, the\r\nHamburg State Opera, and La Scala in Milan. Asked what more he can\r\naccomplish, Milnes replies that \"one hopes to become a better artist all the\r\ntime. But you can only go so fast. If you make family a priority position\r\n-- which is certainly true in this case -- there are only so many hours in\r\nthe day. I could be more famous, were I on television more. But it takes\r\ntime. ... I don't want to sound like: he's satisfied with his career, where\r\nhe is, and he doesn't want to do any more. But I have to realize that my\r\ncareer can no longer continue at the same rate of ascendancy.\"\r\n\r\nHis current show with the Met, Verdi's _Don Carlo_, will continue until\r\nmid-March. \"This is the first time New York has heard the five-act\r\noriginal version,\" notes Milnes. \"We'll be doing it in Italian. People said,\r\n'Why don't you do _Don Carlo_ like the real original, in French?' The\r\nproblem is, five years later, where do you find people who know it in\r\nFrench? There's a practical set of problems when, worldwide, everybody\r\nknow it in Italian. I don't know if it would have been worth it for one\r\nseason.\" Long-range planning is an important aspect of any opera singer's\r\nlife. Milnes already has his schedule set up until 1984.\r\n\r\nThe main reason why Italy has declined in importance as a center for\r\nopera, says Milnes, is that the country's economic problems make it\r\nimpossible for the companies to book singers years in advance. \"I think\r\nAmerica is now producing more singers than Italy, and Spain is very high\r\non the list of producing singers.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to Italy that Milnes owes much of his success. \"We have that phrase\r\n'Verdi baritone' -- sometimes more generically, 'Italian baritone.' There's\r\nno question that Verdi treated the baritone as a special voice category,\r\ndifferently really than composers before him. He did a lot of title roles for\r\nthe baritone voice, and really split the bass and baritone roles very much.\"\r\n\r\nWidely known as an unselfish performer who gives his time freely to\r\nothers, Milnes is chairman of the board of Affiliated Artists, a non-profit\r\norganization that arranges concerts across America for young, up-and\r\ncoming singers.\r\n\r\nBorn on an Illinois farm, he studied piano and violin from early\r\nchildhood. In high school, he won the state music contest in five separate\r\ncategories, including vocal soloist. Deciding that his voice was the\r\ninstrument that showed most promise, he began his professional career as\r\na member of a chorus attached to the Chicago Symphony. In 1960 he\r\nturned to opera. Boris Goldovsky, the opera maestro, signed him\r\nimmediately, taught his willing pupil the fine points of acting in opera,\r\nand took him on five cross-country tours. Since 1962, Milnes has had\r\npractically no time for anything but singing.\r\n\r\nA dedicated family man, he is married to soprano Nancy Stokes. The\r\ncouple has a 6-year-old son, Shawn, and Milnes has two other children\r\nfrom a previous marriage. He has been a Westsider for almost 10 years.\r\n\r\nNot at all snobbish about his own musical gifts, Milnes believes that\r\nsinging is excellent recreation for anyone, regardless of voice quality. \"I\r\nencourage people to sing in the shower. It's a great emotional outlet. Even\r\nif you're lousy, it makes you sound fantastic. When I'm on the stage, I\r\nalways have that feeling that I'm never going to sound as good as I do in\r\nthe shower. You can't get the same _ring_ when you're singing to 5,000\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER CARLOS MONTOYA\r\nMaster of the flamenco guitar\r\n\r\n10-28-78\r\n\r\nCarlos Montoya speaks two languages. The first is music; the other is\r\nSpanish. At 74, he is the world's most famous master of flamenco -- the\r\nancient folk music of the Spanish gypsies, which Montoya performs with\r\ndazzling speed and dexterity. On October 29 he will give a major concert\r\nat Avery Fisher Hall.\r\n\r\nWith more than 30 albums to his credit, Montoya is the most recorded\r\nflamenco guitarist in history. He is thoroughly committed to his\r\ninstrument. It is not merely his living, but his life. He is a pure gypsy --\r\n\"on all four sides,\" as the Spanish say. Maybe that explains why he likes\r\nto tour from January to May and from October to December every year,\r\nalmost nonstop, across the U.S. and Canada, to South America, Europe\r\nand the Far East. He has been a Westsider since the 1940s and has rented\r\nthe same Westside apartment since 1957. Yet when people ask Montoya\r\nwhere he lives, he is likely to reply, \"On airplanes.\"\r\n\r\nAn American citizen for more than 30 years, he is perhaps the first\r\npersons ever to acquire citizenship after answering \"no\" to the question,\r\n\"Do you like the American form of government?\" Because of his poor\r\nEnglish, he had misunderstood the query. He corrected himself, and that\r\nnight played for President Harry Truman.\r\n\r\nMontoya's wife, Sally, is his steady helpmate. Since their marriage in\r\n1940, she has been his manager, interpreter and best friend. He still\r\nspeaks little English, so interviews with him are often ponderous three\r\nway affairs. When I arrived at the Montoyas' residence late one morning,\r\nhe was very polite, but eager to get the interview over with. \"Vamos,\" he\r\nsaid. His demeanor changed when he discovered that I was able to\r\nunderstand his crisp, precise Spanish when spoken slowly. We quickly\r\ndispensed with the interpreter.\r\n\r\nDoes he consider flamenco to be the highest art attainable on the guitar?\r\nSitting upright in an overstuffed chair, he smiled benignly and said, \"Not\r\nall the flamenco guitarists are artists. There are many guitarists, but in the\r\nworld there are only two or three artists on the flamenco guitar. ... Most\r\nmusicians are technicians. I think that to play flamenco as it should be\r\nplayed, you have to be an artist. The music is either very bad or very\r\ngood. People who hear the performance may applaud both the technician\r\nand the artist. But afterward, if the performer was not an artist, they\r\nforget what they have heard.\"\r\n\r\nThe smile remained on his face, and he began to use his hands with much\r\nexpression as he continued. \"I carry the music inside me. I want to touch\r\ninside the heart of the public. That's what I always aim for. My music is\r\nsincere. It is very human. I believe it should be listened to closely. That\r\nis why I play concerts.\"\r\n\r\nHe was, in fact, the first prominent flamenco guitarist to go solo. Until\r\nMontoya started giving one-man concerts in 1948, flamenco was strictly\r\na music to accompany singers or dancers, who added to the rhythm with\r\ncastanets, snapping fingers and feverishly clicking heels. When faced with\r\nMontoya's guitar alone, the audiences did not catch on immediately. But\r\nas soon as they learned to appreciate the full range of his artistry, his\r\ncareer was assured.\r\n\r\nMany of the sound effects produced by a whole flamenco group can be\r\nduplicated by Montoya alone. His left hand can play a melody and tap out\r\na rhythm independent of what the right hand is going. To add to the\r\nexcitement, Montoya never plays a piece the same way twice. One reason\r\nis that improvisation is the essence of flamenco. Another is that he has\r\nnever learned to read music.\r\n\r\n\"Flamenco guitar is more popular than ever right now,\" said Montoya.\r\n\"Young people like it; I perform at a lot of colleges. I also perform with\r\nmany symphony orchestras to play my _Flamenco Suite_.\r\n\r\nThat composition, which Montoya co-wrote and premiered in 1996, is the\r\nfirst flamenco piece ever to be written for a full orchestra. The guitar\r\nsections, appropriately, allow for some improvising. Other works by\r\nMontoya, mainly his arrangements of age-old gypsy themes, have been\r\ntranscribed and published for the benefit of fellow guitarists. However, as\r\nMontoya pointed out, \"the style you can write. But all the notes -- it is\r\nimpossible. So, my written works are simplified.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Madrid, he took his first guitar lesson at the age of 8, and by his\r\nearly teens was performing regularly in cafes. He toured extensively until\r\nWorld War II broke out, when he more or less \"settled\" in New York. In\r\ntruth, he has never been content to settle anywhere. He spends several\r\nmonths each year in Spain. And when he's on tour, said his wife, \"he gets\r\nrestless staying around the hotel, and likes to visit all the sights in the\r\narea.\"\r\n\r\nSally Montoya, a slender, graceful native New Yorker who met Carlos\r\nwhile her father was working for the Foreign Service, was once a\r\nSpanish-style dancer herself, but gave it up because \"I obviously didn't\r\ndance as well as Carlos plays. I'm a casualty of his success.\" The couple\r\nhas two sons.\r\n\r\nExcept for travel, Carlos Montoya has few interests outside his work.\r\n\"Music and family -- that's all,\" he said quietly. \"To be an artist, you\r\nmust be a slave to the instrument and to the public. To play the guitar is\r\na serious thing -- not a game. To me, it is a complete life.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MELBA MOORE\r\nBroadway star releases ninth album\r\n\r\n10-14-78\r\n\r\nWhen Melba Moore recently dropped out of her co-starring role in the\r\nBroadway hit musical _Timbuktu_, there was a lot of speculation as to the\r\nreason why. Some observers suggested that Eartha Kitt, the biggest box\r\noffice draw, did not like to share the billing with a performer of Melba's\r\ncaliber.\r\n\r\nMelba herself has a simpler explanation: seven months of one show is\r\nenough, and she had too many other things to do -- promoting her new\r\nalbum, preparing for another Broadway musical, doing her first lead role\r\nin a movie, going on a concert tour, making guest appearances on\r\ntelevision, and taking care of her 16-month-old daughter Charli.\r\n\r\n\"Honey, I could join the Olympics with all I do,\" says Melba one\r\nafternoon at the comfortable midtown office that is used as the nerve\r\ncenter for her multiple activities. She is dressed in a striped hat, a white\r\nshirt and a bright red necktie. Easing her slender form onto the couch, she\r\nlooks smaller, younger, and more beautiful in person than her photographs\r\nindicate. I remark on her flashy necktie, and Melba, using her hands\r\nexpressively while she speaks, tells with amusement how she saw it on the\r\ncollar of a salesman at Fiorucci's and said to him, \"I want that tie.\"\r\n\r\nMelba's first professional stage role was in _Hair_; from 1968 to 1970 she\r\nrose up through the chorus to win the female lead. \"I have no hard-luck\r\nstories,\" she says, in her clear, nearly accentless voice. \"From _Hair_, I\r\nwent right into _Purlie_.\" That was the role that earned her the 1970 Tony\r\nAward for Best Supporting Actress and the New York Drama Critics' and\r\nDrama Desk Awards.\r\n\r\nMelba was born 32 years ago on West 108th Street. Both her parents were\r\nentertainers, and Melba began singing at the age of 4. At college she\r\nmajored in music, and upon graduation, taking the advice of her parents\r\nto \"get some security,\" she taught school for a year. But soon a burning\r\ndesire to get into show business took hold of her, and she quit teaching.\r\n\"Ever since that day,\" she recalls, \"even before I got my first singing job,\r\nthe whole world looked better to me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was while working as a studio singer that she was given an audition for\r\n_Hair_, and since then her story has been a virtually unbroken success.\r\nMelba has starred in numerous television shows, including her own\r\nsummer series for CBS and an ABC special on the life of abolitionist\r\nHarriet Tubman. Better known for her singing than her acting, Melba has\r\nrecorded nine albums and has received a Grammy nomination. Her most\r\nremarkable vocal feat, however, was probably her one-woman concert at\r\nthe Metropolitan Opera House in December 1976, which won her rave\r\nnotices from every music critic in town. In the concert, she performed\r\neverything from ballads to rock to opera.\r\n\r\n\"Singing opera actually rests my voice,\" says Melba. \"It's like doing\r\nvocal exercises.\" Equally at home in a nightclub or a concert hall, she has\r\ndemonstrated her four-octave range with many of America's leading\r\norchestras.\r\n\r\nHer new album, released late in September by Epic Records and titled\r\nsimply _Melba Moore_, contains both disco songs and straight ballads.\r\nOne of the cuts, \"You Stepped Into My Life,\" is out as a single. Another\r\ncut is \"The Greatest,\" from a film about Muhammad Ali. \"No, I didn't\r\nsing it in the movie, but I am an Ali fan. I'm a fight fan. I turn on the\r\ncable and watch everyone -- flyweights, everybody. People I've never\r\nhard of.\"\r\n\r\nHer new movie, _Purlie_, in which Melba will recreate her Broadway\r\nsmash success, is scheduled to begin filming this November in the\r\ncountryside of Georgia. Melba plays the orphan Lutibelle Gussiemae\r\nJenkins. After the movie, she will devote most of her time to a new\r\nmusical, _Harlem Renaissance_, which is planned to reach Broadway next\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe day after she quit _Timbuktu_, Melba headed for Acapulco to be one\r\nof the judges in the Miss Universe Pageant. \"They said there were going\r\nto be 600 million people watching, so I made sure my nose was\r\npowdered. ... They worked us from sunup to sunup, but I did manage to\r\nget a little suntan,\" she says teasingly, showing me a patch of light brown\r\nskin directly under her top shirt button.\r\n\r\nMarried for the past five years to restaurateur Charles Huggins, Melba is\r\noverjoyed to have a child at last -- \"we have been waiting for her\" -- and\r\nspends as much time as she can with her daughter. A Westsider off and\r\non for most of her life, Melba is fond of shopping at Vim and Vigor\r\nHealth Foods (57th Street near the Carnegie Recital Hall), then going next\r\ndoor to the Merit Farm Store, where she buys her favorite junk food.\r\n\r\nOf all her accomplishments in the last 10 years, Melba is perhaps proudest\r\nof her involvement with an international television series for children,\r\n_Big Blue Marble_, which is currently being shown in 78 countries.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very much into international things,\" says Melba, \"I have appeared\r\nin some of the segments, but basically my role is to let people know about\r\nit. ... In some way, we hope that the program can help promote peace and\r\nunderstanding to these children -- while they're still at a vulnerable age.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MICHAEL MORIARTY\r\nStar of _Holocaust_ returns to Broadway in _G.R. Point_\r\n\r\n5-5-79\r\n\r\nWhen Michael Moriarty rose to national stardom last year with his chilling\r\nportrayal of SS Officer Dorf in the NBC miniseries _Holocaust_, his\r\nperformance was witnessed by some 120 million Americans. His current\r\nvehicle, _G.R. Point_ at the Playhouse Theatre on West 48th Street plays\r\nto a maximum audience of 500. Yet, in the lead role of Micah Bradstreet,\r\na wet-behind-the-ears soldier from rural Maine, Moriarty delivers what\r\nClive Barnes of the _New York Post_ has said is \"the best performance,\r\nso far, of his career.\"\r\n\r\n_G.R. Point_ is a play about the Vietnam War and its effects on those\r\nwho are forced to partake in it. Set on a strikingly designed stage built to\r\nresemble a devastated hillside, the play demonstrates how each of the\r\neight characters manages to cope with his predicament in his own way. Its\r\nmessage is summed up in the final words of the drama, spoken to Micah\r\nas he departs for the U.S.: he is told to \"count the living, not the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the main reasons I wanted to do this play is that it affirms life,\"\r\nsays Moriarty, in a dressing room interview just before a performance. \"It\r\ndoesn't take any specific political stance, but it doesn't avoid any of the\r\nhorrors of war. Its only stance is: in the end, what overcomes the situation\r\nis love. And love sometimes shows itself in the strangest, most bizarre\r\nways.\"\r\n\r\nHe is tall and solidly built, looking somewhat younger than his 38 years,\r\nand though his demeanor has an edge of shyness to it, Moriarty's\r\npenetrating eyes reveal that much is going on beneath the surface. Asked\r\nabout his personal views on Vietnam, the actor replies, \"I'm not an\r\nintellectual, so I have no specific feelings about it.\" But his conversation\r\nsoon reveals him to be a deep thinker and a wit besides, whose remarks\r\nare tempered as much by humility as by professional instinct.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever I could say about the war has been better stated by David\r\nBerry, the playwright. I'm able to show my emotional response to the war\r\nthrough Micah Bradstreet. ... I'm not trying to influence anyone in any\r\nway in particular. I do think the play tells the truth about Vietnam. So the\r\nmore information people have, the better decisions they can make.\"\r\n\r\nMoriarty's decision to become a dramatic actor can be traced to his\r\nundergraduate days at Dartmouth College, when he was overwhelmed by\r\nPaul Scofield's performance in _Love's Labor Lost_. Following\r\ngraduation, he won a Fulbright Scholarship to attend the London Academy\r\nof Music and Dramatic Art. In 1974, after years of perfecting his craft in\r\ntheatres across America, he picked up the first of his two Tony Awards\r\nfor his performances in _Find Your Way Home_. Equally skilled at\r\ntelevision acting, he is the recipient of two Emmys, including one for\r\n_Holocaust_.\r\n\r\nA Detroit native of Scandinavian and Irish ancestry, Moriarty attends\r\nCatholic mass regularly, and finds much inspiration in the Bible, both\r\nspiritual and literary. His chief hobby is music: he is a polished\r\nsinger/pianist/songwriter who frequently performs in the city's leading\r\nnightclubs between acting assignments. Asked whether he would consider\r\nteaming up with octogenarian blues singer Alberta Hunter at the Cookery\r\nin Greenwich Village, he replies with a laugh, \"That's very heavy\r\ncompany. I'll cook and she'll sing.\" He usually practices in the morning.\r\n\"I'll ramble over the piano and play some easy music. It's purely\r\naccording to my libido. You might call it ad libido. Hey, not bad! How's\r\nthat for an album title?\"\r\n\r\nAnother of his talents is writing plays. Although hesitant to discuss this\r\nup-and-coming aspect of his career, Moriarty finally admits that one of his\r\nplays was recently read dramatically at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton,\r\nNew Jersey, under the direction of Ben Levit. \"It was none of my doing.\r\nI sat back, and it all happened before my very eyes. I was astonished, and\r\npleased, and proud, and in no great hurry to see it produced except by this\r\ndirector -- if he wants to.\"\r\n\r\nLong a devotee of Shakespeare, Moriarty founded his own non-profit\r\nShakespearean company, Potter's Field, in 1977. He and his group\r\nperform free each Sunday in Central Park near the statue of Sir Walter\r\nScott, weather permitting.\r\n\r\nIn response to a question about the West Side, where he has lived for the\r\npast five years, Moriarty says that \"you can walk one block and encounter\r\neverything the world should either be proud of or ashamed of.\" His\r\nfavorite local restaurants include Coq du Vin on 8th Avenue and O'Neal's\r\nBalloon at 6th Avenue and 57th Street. \"Pat O'Neal and I crack jokes\r\nabout my career as a waiter. I worked at O'Neal's off and on for about\r\nfour years. I was terrible! They kept me on out of sheer compassion. I\r\nguess I became an endearing lunkhead.\"\r\n\r\nOther goals? \"None that I'd care to mention,\" says Moriarty, smiling\r\nsoftly. \"All the other ones are neurotic, and I don't want to expose them.\r\nI've done it too often. In my neuroses, I think, 'Gee, I'd like to do that\r\nor this.' But in my higher self, I have no unfulfilled needs.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER LeROY NEIMAN\r\nAmerica's greatest popular artist\r\n\r\n1-27-79\r\n\r\nLike Norman Rockwell before him, LeRoy Neiman has the distinction of\r\nbeing one of the very few American artists whose work is familiar to\r\npractically everybody in the country -- rich and poor, black and white,\r\nurban and rural, educated and illiterate.\r\n\r\nThis is as far as their similarity goes, however. Rockwell, who died in\r\nNovember, 1978 at the age of 84, was known for his meticulously\r\ndetailed, placid portraits of American family life, while Neiman has built\r\nhis reputation on action-filled scenes composed of bold splashes of color.\r\nRockwell's career started and ended at the _Saturday Evening Post_;\r\nNeiman's began at _Playboy_ and has reached its zenith in an entirely new\r\nmedium -- television. His televised mural of the 1976 Olympic Games was\r\nseen by an estimated 170 million people.\r\n\r\nOne of the most commercially successful artists in the world, LeRoy\r\nNeiman has spent the last 18 years living and working in a huge\r\napartment/studio just off Central Park West. His original paintings\r\ncommand up to $50,000 each, but the larger portion of his work comes\r\nout in the form of limited-edition serigraphs (silkscreen prints). A single\r\npiece of silkscreen art generally yields some 300 prints, each of which\r\nsells for about $1,500.\r\n\r\nNeiman's eye-catching style is admired everywhere. His posters and\r\ncalendars are best-sellers in Japan; several of his painting are on\r\npermanent display at the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad. He was the\r\nofficial United States artist-in-residence for the last two Olympics and will\r\nbe for the 1980 Games as well. Although best known for his sports\r\npictures, Neiman is also a renowned portraitist who specializes in famous\r\nfaces. He is attracted by drama and excitement of any kind, whether found\r\nin a tavern inhabited by the Beautiful People, in a heavyweight fight, in\r\na world chess championship, or, as television viewers witnessed last\r\nJanuary, in a Super Bowl. Neiman sat on the sidelines of that contest\r\ndrawing pictures of the game in progress, using a computer-controlled\r\nelectronic pen and palette. The pictures were then flashed onto the\r\ntelevision screen.\r\n\r\n\"It's painting with light,\" explains Neiman one morning in his studio,\r\ntaking a break from the half-dozen oils and acrylics he is working on. \"It\r\ngives you the same sense of creation as any other art medium. You're\r\nbuilding and creating an image of your own that wasn't there when you\r\nstarted. The only limitation you ever have in doing a work of art is\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nStarting this month, Neiman's work has become a regular feature of _CBS\r\nSports Spectacular_. At the beginning and end of each program, Neiman's\r\npaintings are interspersed with photographs of athletes to form a moving\r\ncollage of colors and shapes. The artist has been contracted to make six\r\nor seven personal appearances on the program over the next year, in\r\nwhich he will demonstrate the art of drawing sports in action.\r\n\r\nNeiman is a suave, sophisticated man who loves his work and loves to talk\r\nabout it. Dressed in a fancy denim-style suit, with a long, thin cigar\r\nprotruding from under his handlebar moustache, he expounds on a score\r\nof subjects as if he had all the time in the world. In the adjacent room, the\r\ntelephone rings almost unceasingly. It is answered by his assistant, who\r\ncalls out the message to him. More likely than not, it is a request for\r\nNeiman's artistic services.\r\n\r\n\"I sketch all the time,\" he says. \"A sketch is not necessarily a study to\r\nme. It's a record -- something to consult with. I sketch an awful lot in\r\npublic. Because when I go someplace and I get bored, I sketch.\r\nEverybody forgives me for it. They think I have an uncontrollable desire\r\nto draw.\"\r\n\r\nHis style, says Neiman, \"came out of nowhere. It happened very\r\nsuddenly, about 1954, just before I started with _Playboy_.\" That\r\nmagazine recently honored him with an award for being one of the five\r\nmost important contributors in its 25-year history.\r\n\r\nDuring his childhood in Minnesota, recalls Neiman, \"I was always\r\ndrawing pictures and getting special treatment at school -- showing off,\r\ncopping out of other things. ... I lived a couple of years in England and\r\nFrance.\" since moving to New York, he has been a constant Westsider.\r\nCentral Park, says Neiman, \"is the West Side's front yard, but the East\r\nSide's back yard.\"\r\n\r\nNeiman's latest one-man show is an exhibit of approximately 50\r\nserigraphs, etching, and drawings at Hammer Graphics on East 57th\r\nStreet. Part of the proceeds from sales will go to the U.S. Olympic\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\"I turn most things down, because they're not stimulating and inspiring,\"\r\nsays Neiman matter-of-factly. \"Money isn't enough stimulus to do\r\nsomething I don't like. ... I work very hard. I fool around a lot too, but\r\nI don't go on vacations. I don't have hobbies. I put my vices within my\r\ncraft.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ARNOLD NEWMAN\r\nGreat portrait photographer\r\n\r\n12-1-79\r\n\r\nWhen the _Sunday Times_ of London decided to hire someone to\r\nphotograph 50 leading British citizens for a show at England's National\r\nPortrait Gallery, the venerable newspaper caused something of an uproar\r\nby choosing an American for the job -- Arnold Newman, one of the\r\nworld's most important portrait photographers for the past 30 years.\r\n\r\nThe 50 portraits, whose subjects include Sir Lawrence Oliver, Sir John\r\nGielgud, Sir Alec Guinness, Henry Moore, Lord Mountbatten and Harold\r\nPinter, were exhibited last month at the Light Gallery on Fifth Avenue,\r\nand have just opened in London. Meanwhile, the book version of the\r\nprints, with extensive commentary, has been published this month as _The\r\nGreat British_ (New York Graphic Society, Boston, $14.95). The\r\nphotographs, like those found in Newman's three previous books and in\r\nhis hundreds of assignments for _Life_, _Look_, _Newsweek_ and other\r\npublications, are far more than mere portraits. Rather, they are profound\r\nartistic statements, in which the background of the picture often\r\nsymbolizes the person's achievement.\r\n\r\n\"I don't use props: I use reality,\" explains Newman, taking a break at the\r\nWest 57th Street studio he has occupied since 1948. On the wall are\r\npictures -- he prefers that word to \"photographs\" -- of Marc Chagall,\r\nPablo Picasso, Eugene O'Neill and four American presidents; Newman\r\nhas photographed every president since Truman.\r\n\r\nBig, burly, mellow-voiced and casually dressed, Arnold Newman at 61\r\nlooks like an aging beatnik. His quick wit and ready laugh mask a\r\nperfectionism that has characterized his work ever since he turned to\r\nphotography in 1938. His ability \"to make the camera see what I saw\"\r\nshowed itself almost at once. In 1941 he held his first exhibition and sold\r\nhis first print to the Museum of Modern Art.\r\n\r\n\"I could have made, over the years, a hell of a lot more money than I\r\nhave, simply by doing more commercial work and cashing in on my\r\nreputation. But that doesn't interest me,\" he reflects, puffing on his ever\r\npresent cigar. \"I mean, money interests me, but I'd just see my life being\r\nwasted.\"\r\n\r\nSpecializing in portraits of artists, he studies the work of each subject\r\nintensely beforehand so that the essence of the artist will be distilled into\r\nthe photograph, by subconscious as well as conscious effort. On the side,\r\nhe does enough commercial work to support his own artistic efforts. But\r\nover the years, the two have somehow merged: \"I'm forever being\r\ncommissioned for things I'd give my eye teeth to do, and paid very well\r\nfor it. Recently I went out to do a photograph strictly on my own of\r\nsomebody I admired, and I hate the picture. Yet the day before I did a\r\npicture for money which I think is one of my best pictures in the last three\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1953, he went to Washington to photograph 15 U.S. senators for\r\n_Holiday_ magazine, including John F. Kennedy -- then a political\r\nunknown who was sometimes labeled the Playboy senator. \"Years later,\"\r\nrecalls Newman, \"I was photographing President Kennedy on the White\r\nHouse lawn. He turned to me and said, 'Arnold, whatever happened to\r\nthat first picture you took of me?'\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'Well, Mr. President, we did 15 senators, and they found out they\r\nhad one too many for the layout, so they dropped the one least likely to\r\nsucceed.'\r\n\r\n\"And you have to understand: we were surrounded by secret servicemen,\r\nand Pierre Salinger, his press secretary, was there. Well I thought I'd get\r\na big yack, because Kennedy had a marvelous sense of humor. But\r\ninstead, his face went rigid. And I -- I absolutely turned ice cold. The\r\nSecret Service men turned around and gave me a 'How stupid can you\r\nbe?' look.\r\n\r\n\"A bit later I managed to get into Pierre's office and started stammering\r\nand apologizing. Suddenly Pierre started breaking out in laughter. I said,\r\n'What the hell's so funny?' He said, 'He was pulling your leg! He's been\r\nwalking all around the White House for the last 30 minutes, telling that\r\nstory on himself.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter the assassination, Newman was called to the White House again to\r\nphotograph the official portrait of Lyndon Johnson. \"He could give an\r\nangel an ulcer. ... I didn't get paid for the picture, not even my expenses.\r\nIt cost me a fortune.\"\r\n\r\nArnold and his wife Augusta have been married for 31 years; she runs the\r\nstudio and works closely with him. Their two sons, Eric and David, are\r\nprofessionals in neurology and architecture, respectively. The Newmans'\r\nfavorite neighborhood restaurants include Rikyu and Genghiz Khan's\r\nBicycle on Columbus Avenue, and the Cafe des Artistes on their own\r\nblock.\r\n\r\nAsked whether he eventually plans to pursue other areas of photography\r\nbesides portraits, Newman shakes his head. \"The whole history of painting\r\nwas changed by a man who used the same materials as everybody else did\r\n-- the same brushes, paints, canvas, and subject matter,\" he explains. \"So\r\nwhy do we say that Cezanne revolutionized painting? It's his ideas. I deal\r\nwith ideas too.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER EDWIN NEWMAN\r\nJournalist and first-time novelist\r\n\r\n8-11-79\r\n\r\n\"When you achieve a certain prominence on television,\" says NBC's\r\nEdwin Newman, \"publishers come to you and ask you to write books.\r\nThen you go round in circles for a while, and finally say, 'Gee, I'd like\r\nto write a book, but I don't have the time.'\"\r\n\r\nSix years ago, the award-winning broadcast journalist decided to find out\r\nif he was bluffing himself. He spent seven months of his spare time\r\nwriting a book called _Strictly Speaking: Will America be the Death of\r\nEnglish?_ Published in 1974 when Newman was 55 years old, it became\r\nthe nation's number one best-seller for non-fiction. His follow-up book,\r\n_A Civil Tongue_ (1976), was another best-seller.\r\n\r\nNow Edwin newman has written his first novel, _Sunday Punch_\r\n(Houghton Mifflin, $9.95). Published in June, it has already gone through\r\ntwo printings in hardcover, totaling 60,000 copies. The _Atlantic_ has\r\ndescribed the book as \"a Wodehousian excursion that is lighter than air\r\nand twice as much fun as laughing gas.\"\r\n\r\nIn a leisurely interview at his Rockefeller Plaza office, the author comes\r\nacross very much as he does on television. His leathery features expand\r\neasily into a smile as he delivers, in his slow, concise, foghorn voice,\r\ncomments that are as thought-provoking as they are witty.\r\n\r\n_Sunday Punch_, he says, \"is the story of an extremely thin, tall, British\r\nprizefighter named Aubrey Philpott-Grimes who comes to the U.S. to\r\nfight because he can make more money here than in Britain. The more\r\nmoney he makes, the higher taxes he can pay, and Aubrey is a great\r\nbeliever in paying taxes. He is tremendously interested in economics, so\r\nthat if he is brought to the microphone after a fight, he'll probably start\r\ntalking about structural unemployment and floating exchange rates, rather\r\nthan talking about fighting. ... The book allows me to comment on the\r\nUnited States from the view of an outsider.\"\r\n\r\nHis fascination with the cultural and linguistic differences of the U.S. and\r\nEngland dates back to the late 1940s, when Newman left his job with the\r\nWashington-based International News Service and moved to London.\r\nThere, he found work as a \"stringer\" for the NBC network, and when he\r\nwas invited to join the full-time staff in 1952, he remained at the British\r\ncapital for five more years. In 1961, after serving as NBC bureau chief\r\nin both Paris and Rome, he returned to his native Manhattan and settled\r\ninto his present Eastside apartment with his English wife, Rigel. The\r\nNewmans' daughter Nancy was educated entirely in England.\r\n\r\nA harsh critic of the state of the language in America today, Newman is\r\nthe head of the Usage Panel for the American Heritage Dictionary. He is\r\nalways being sent examples of poor English. \"Do you want to know what\r\naccountability is?\" he says, his eyes crinkling with amusement as he takes\r\na letter from his desk. \"This is from a teachers' committee in Kalamazoo,\r\nMichigan. 'Accountability is a concept that, when operationalized, finds\r\nthe interrelatedness and parameters of responsibility shaped by individuals\r\nwithin the system.'\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me there are two movements going on that affect language in\r\nthe United States, and it's curious that they would be going on at the same\r\ntime, because in a way they conflict with each other. One is the increasing\r\nuse of jargon and pomposity, which can partly traced to the size of the\r\ngovernment. As the government grows, this kind of language grows. ...\r\nThe more technical they make the language sound, the more money\r\nthey're likely to earn.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have the influence of the social sciences, where exactly the\r\nsame thing goes on. People attempt to take familiar ideas, small ideas, and\r\nin some cases no ideas, and make them sound large by wrapping them up\r\nin grandiose language.\r\n\r\n\"The other movement that is going on is based on the notion that correct,\r\nspecific, concrete language doesn't matter very much. What matters is that\r\nyour heart be in the right place. ... This idea was thoroughly welcome to\r\nmany people in education. For one thing, it means that you have less\r\nwritten work to correct. And also, of course, if you don't have to teach\r\ncorrect English, you don't have to know it.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his 28 years as an NBC news correspondent, Edwin Newman has\r\nexcelled in so many areas that he has become known as the network's\r\n\"Renaissance man.\" One of the most quick-thinking ad-libbers on the air,\r\nhe is frequently called upon to do live \"instant specials\" of breaking news.\r\nHe moderated the first Ford-Carter debate in 1976, has hosted the _Today\r\nShow_ numerous times, has covered six national political conventions and\r\nreported from 35 foreign countries. Each Monday through Friday, he is\r\nheard on both radio and television across the U.S. in a series of news\r\nbriefs.\r\n\r\nHis biggest project at the moment is a two-hour, prime-time documentary\r\non U.S. foreign policy, which is scheduled to be aired early in September.\r\n\r\n\"I think in some way,\" concludes Newman, \"I fell into the right\r\nprofession. Somebody said -- I think it was H.L. Mencken -- that you go\r\ninto the news business because it gives you a front-row seat. And he\r\nmight have added that not only does it give you a front row seat, but you\r\nget the seat free.\"\r\n\r\nborn 1-15-19\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER LARRY O'BRIEN\r\nCommissioner of the National Basketball Association\r\n\r\n2-16-80\r\n\r\nFame rests lightly on the shoulders of Larry O'Brien, who was raised on\r\npolitics in his hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts and never sought\r\nelective office for himself, yet became one of the Democratic Party's most\r\ninfluential spokesmen for nearly two decades.\r\n\r\nAs a campaign manager, he propelled John F. Kennedy into the Senate\r\nand then into the White House. He served as postmaster general under\r\nPresident Johnson from 1965 to 1968, and was twice named chairman of\r\nthe Democratic National Committee, a post traditionally given to the\r\nparty's foremost political strategist. His name loomed large in the\r\nWatergate hearings, for it was O'Brien whose office was broken into by\r\nthe original Watergate burglars.\r\n\r\nHe was in the news again in 1974, when, having retired from politics, he\r\npublished his autobiography, _No Final Victories_. Expecting to be out\r\nof the public eye after that, O'Brien was astonished to be offered the job\r\nof commissioner of the National Basketball Association. Now midway\r\nthrough his fifth season, he has not only resolved the major disputes that\r\nthreatened the future of professional basketball, but has brought a new\r\nvitality to the sport.\r\n\r\nThe NBA's headquarters, a plush suite of office high above Fifth Avenue,\r\nis silent and practically empty on the afternoon of my appointment with\r\nthe commissioner. A gregarious host, he talks about basketball and politics\r\nfor nearly two hours in his effusive manner, while chain-smoking low-tar\r\ncigarettes. He is a hearty, husky man with a basso voice that rarely alters\r\nin pitch, and is as casual as a bartender.\r\n\r\nBrought up in the town where basketball was invented, the son of Irish\r\nimmigrants, he worked his way through law school by tending bar in his\r\nfather's cafe in the daytime and taking classes at night. One of the most\r\ntrusted of politicians, known for his uncommon organizational abilities and\r\nhis gift for compromise, O'Brien is a fascinatingly long-winded\r\nconversationalist who speaks with many digressions.\r\n\r\n\"The sports commissioner is somewhat unique. First of all, you are paid\r\nby the owners, and you are expected to be as responsive as you can to the\r\nfans -- to do everything possible to ensure that the game is presented in\r\nthe best conceivable way to the fans, and the most exciting and interesting\r\nmanner, because after all, this is business.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Kennedy and Johnson White House years, he served as\r\npresidential liaison to Congress and helped win passage of the Peace\r\nCorps, Medicare, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As commissioner, his\r\nauthority is all-powerful. \"It goes to supervision of every aspect of the\r\ngame, on and off the court,\" he explains. \"It goes to determining even\r\nwhat time games are played and who plays them.\"\r\n\r\nAttendance in the NBA has risen considerably this year; O'Brien\r\ncheerfully attributes it to the resurgence of the Boston Celtics and the\r\nimprovement of the New York Knicks.\r\n\r\nRecently Dallas was granted a franchise to create a new NBA team, the\r\n23rd in the U.S. \"If there were further expansion beyond 24 teams,\"\r\nO'Brien predicts, \"I think it would take on an international flavor. ...\r\nThere are a number of countries in Europe that are playing quality\r\nbasketball at the professional level. I envision that by the mid-80s, you\r\nwould find countries in Europe that could be competitive with us.\r\nProbably the first step would be only exhibitions, but I can see it reaching\r\na point where you could give serious thought to establishing another\r\nconference perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nLarry and his wife Elva have been married since 1944; their son Laurence\r\nIII is a Washington-based lawyer. An Eastside resident during most of the\r\nlast seven years, O'Brien recalls the Watergate break-in with grim humor.\r\n\"We didn't have anything in the office anyway. We were practically\r\nbankrupt. I thought, maybe there's a typewriter missing. ... I was a\r\ndisbeliever. It took a long time for it to penetrate that this was real. ...\r\nMy best recollection of that period is that I was very depressed, in the\r\nsense of what effects it was having on our system of government.\r\n\r\n\"When I was on my book promotion tour, people would ask, 'How does\r\nit feel to be a politician?' as if it was a dirty word. I have always been\r\nproud of being a politician, and I've never felt otherwise. But I found that\r\nall of us involved in politics were painted with the same brush.\"\r\n\r\nHis mood brightens when the subject returns to basketball. Speaking of the\r\nrecent backboard-shattering antics of \"Chocolate Thunder\" Darryl\r\nDawkins, O'Brien reports that the star \"said that he certainly could adjust\r\nhis dunk shot to prevent further incidents.\"\r\n\r\nThe most difficult aspect of his job so far, says O'Brien, has been to\r\nenforce the compensation agreement that players and owners signed four\r\nyears ago. \"Compensation means that when a player has terminated his\r\ncontractual obligations to a club, the new club that acquires him must\r\nmake compensation to the other team, and work that out between them.\r\nAnd then if the two teams fail to reach an agreement, the case comes to\r\nme and I determine what compensation is appropriate. In making the\r\nlosing club whole, I can assign draft choices, players, money, or any\r\ncombination thereof. It's extremely difficult -- weighing players against\r\nplayers, and deciding how much money is valid compensation. There's no\r\nsure way of doing it, unless you were Solomon or you had a crystal ball\r\nas to how it would turn out.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MAUREEN O'SULLIVAN\r\nGreat lady of the movie screen\r\n\r\n3-4-78\r\n\r\nAs recently as 10 years ago, most of the motion pictures filmed in this\r\ncountry had a single run at the theatres, and then were seldom seen or\r\nheard from again.\r\n\r\nTelevision has changed that. Now, with longer broadcasting hours and the\r\nabundance of new channels, vintage movies are enjoying a second life,\r\noften with a bigger audience than the first time. Maybe that's why the\r\nname Maureen O'Sullivan is practically a household word even today.\r\nBetween 1930 and 1965 she made dozens of films, ranging from Marx\r\nBrothers comedy (_A Day At The Races_) to classics of English literature\r\n(_David Copperfield_, _Pride and Prejudice_) to Tarzan films, in which\r\nshe played Jane.\r\n\r\nBut unlike so many of her contemporaries, Maureen is neither dead nor\r\nretired. She maintains a busy schedule of acting, writing, traveling, and\r\nenjoying her status as a mother of five and a grandmother of many.\r\n\r\nMaureen shows me around her large, beautiful apartment facing Central\r\nPark, right across the hallway from Basil Rathbone's last home. \"I keep\r\nthis part for the children,\" she says, indicating a section of several rooms.\r\nThere are photos of her children everywhere, including a good number of\r\nher actress daughters Mia and Tisa Farrow. Mia lives in England and Tisa\r\nis in California, but they still get together frequently.\r\n\r\n\"I'm doing an autobiography now. It's about halfway done. My agent has\r\nthe manuscript. But I'm not writing any more until I see if there's any\r\ninterest in it. ... I started it two years ago, then put it away. I wasn't even\r\ninterested in it myself. Then a friend of mine, John Springer, had me to\r\nlunch. He said, 'You ought to do an autobiography.' I said I had already\r\nstarted one. ... So I went back and worked on it some more, and\r\ncondensed it into 10 pages. I had to do it myself -- every word, syllable,\r\ncomma.\"\r\n\r\nShe recently spent five weeks in upstate New York playing one of the\r\nleads in _The Glass Menagerie_ by Tennessee Williams. The critics had\r\nnothing but praise for her portrayal of the ambitious mother, and one\r\ndescribed Maureen's acting as \"genius.\"\r\n\r\nThe stage is not the only place where Maureen employs her dramatic\r\ntalents. Shortly after completing the Williams play, she went to Albany,\r\nNew York to do a reading from _The Wayward Bus_ for the state\r\nlegislature. \"They're trying to get a new bill through Congress to get\r\nmoney for a program for more halfway houses for women alcoholics,\" she\r\nexplains. \"I believe in that kind of thing.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the last plays she did in New York City was _No Sex Please --\r\nWe're British_. It was a hit in London, and the preview performances\r\nwere doing well enough in New York to call for an official Broadway\r\nopening. \"Then [drama critic] Clive Barnes came to the producer and\r\nsaid, 'If you have an opening you'll have a disaster, because the critics\r\nwon't like it.' And he was right. As soon as the reviews came out, the\r\ntheatre emptied. In the previews, the audiences loved it. The critics made\r\na big thing out of opening night. In London, I don't think the public pays\r\nthat much attention to the critics. The average person there doesn't read\r\nthe reviews.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's the singing lessons she has never stopped taking that account\r\nfor her pure lyrical speaking voice, which is still as sweet as it was when\r\nshe made her first film, _Song of My Heart_, nearly 50 years ago.\r\nThough Maureen's soft British accent gives no hint of it, she was brought\r\nup in Dublin, Ireland. While working as a young actress in England she\r\nwas discovered by an American producer and brought to the U.S. to do\r\nher first movie with famed tenor John McCormack. After that her career\r\nblossomed.\r\n\r\nAny comment on the Tarzan films for which she became famous? \"I made\r\nfive. They have been remembered. I'm glad to be remembered for\r\nsomething. Let's leave it at that.\"\r\n\r\nThese days, while Maureen is waiting to hear about her autobiography,\r\nshe is working on some short stories. Two have appeared in the _Ladies'\r\nHome Journal_. \"I have no special goals,\" she says. \"One thing leads to\r\nanother. Supposing my theatrical career came to an end, I'd like to open\r\nan antique shop in Vermont, and write, and paint -- I always have -- and\r\nsew. If you can do one art, you can do them all. It's different ways of\r\nsaying the same thing.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a special type of grandmother. At the theatre, I like to take the\r\nchildren backstage. And in New York, I take them in a horse and buggy\r\naround the park, or for tea at the Plaza. In that way, I can bring color into\r\ntheir lives.\"\r\n\r\nMaureen has been a Westsider for the past 15 years. \"I'm very fond of\r\nMal the Tailor, on 72nd near Columbus. And Mr. Walsh the florist.\r\nO'Neal's Balloon. The Pioneer Market. They're all on 72nd Street. That's\r\nmy beat.\"\r\n\r\nShe walks toward the window. \"I love this view. The park is different\r\nevery time of the year. Now it's all covered with snow. Pretty soon the\r\nbuds will be all over the trees.\" She smiles contentedly. \"I really think\r\nthat if I had to leave the West Side I'd leave New York. Because to me,\r\nthis is New York.\"\r\n\r\n_Hannah and Her Sisters_.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER BETSY PALMER\r\nStar of _Same Time, Next Year_\r\n\r\n4-1-78\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you take shorthand?\" said Betsy Palmer as we sat down in her\r\ndressing room to chat between shows. \"I could always read and write\r\nshorthand. I worked for the B & O Railroad as a stenographer before I\r\nwent away to school and learned acting. I guess if I had to, I could brush\r\nup and go back to it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's most unlikely that she'll ever have to. Even if her Tony Award\r\nwinning play, _Same Time, Next Year_, should happen to close, Betsy\r\nwould find herself swamped with offers for choice acting roles. But her\r\nhit show about the lighter side of adultery won't be closing for a long time\r\nyet. It is currently being made into a film starring Ellen Burstyn and Alan\r\nAlda.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of people think of me as a personality rather than an actress, and\r\nwhen they come to see me they expect to see that personality,\" says\r\nPalmer, who has one of the more recognizable names and faces on\r\nBroadway. \"Mostly people know me from panel shows. It's been a\r\ndouble-edged sword for me. When they see me doing something that's\r\nreally dramatic, they say, 'My God, she can act!'\"\r\n\r\nShe has made countless appearances on _What's My Line?_, _Girl Talk_\r\nand _The Today Show_, but to most television viewers she is best\r\nremembered as the bright, beautiful, All-American girl who for 11 years\r\nwas a panelist on _I've Got a Secret_.\r\n\r\nDuring her years of TV stardom Betsy was doing plenty of serious acting\r\n-- everything from Shakespeare to Peter Pan to Ibsen. She has made five\r\nHollywood films and performed the lead in numerous Broadway shows,\r\nincluding _South Pacific_, _Cactus Flower_ and Tennessee Williams'\r\n_Eccentricities of a Nightingale_. Few of her roles, however, have been\r\nas demanding as Doris in _Same Time, Next Year_.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, she and her co-star, Monte Markham, are the only\r\ncharacters in the play. Second, the play's action takes place over a period\r\nof 25 years, in which Doris goes through momentous changes. In doing\r\nthis transformation smoothly, Betsy creates a character so believable and\r\nlovable that the audience forgives her for cheating on her husband, which\r\nshe does one weekend a year in order to meet her lover George.\r\n\r\n\"Doing the play takes all my energy.I'm a single woman now, and have\r\nbeen for three years. But if I were involved with somebody now, it would\r\ntake up a lot of my energies. So it doesn't bother me; when the time\r\ncomes for me to be involved, I will be. Right now, I'm really quite\r\nsatisfied to come here six days a week and have a fantasy life. It has all\r\nthe good things in it and none of the bad things. ... It gives you such a\r\nrainbow of colors to express yourself within, that I find it terribly\r\nrewarding and gratifying. I am never bored with the show.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge, like Doris, is married and has three children, and he too goes\r\nthrough drastic changes of attitude during the time period from 1951 to\r\n1976. But while George wins the audience's respect and sympathy, Doris\r\nsteals their hearts.\r\n\r\n\"I get out there and I feel such love. All of a sudden they begin to adore\r\nher. They're watching her spread her wings and finally fly. ... The\r\nadultery is done with such taste. You see two people who really love their\r\nrespective mates, and their children.\"\r\n\r\nIn her cozy backstage room at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, which is\r\ndecorated with Christmas lights, Betsy demonstrates an overbubbling\r\nfriendliness and an extremely fluent style of speech. An interview with her\r\nis both a pleasure and a challenge, for she talks about each subject with\r\nan enthusiasm that makes it hard for anyone to interrupt and go on to the\r\nnext question.\r\n\r\nHer memories of those panel shows? \"You know, we used to do _Secret_\r\nright in this theatre. We must have done it here five, six, seven years\r\neasily. There are a lot of guys here now, on the backstage crew, who\r\nwere here with _Secret_. It's nice to be working with them again. ... But\r\nI'm not interested in the past. The past is an illusion, as is the future.\"\r\n\r\nBetsy has been an off-and-on Westside resident ever since she first came\r\nto New York in 1951. When doing _Same Time, Next Year_ she is\r\nsubletting a friend's apartment on Riverside Drive. Her 16-year-old\r\ndaughter frequently comes down from Connecticut to spend time with her\r\non the West Side.\r\n\r\n\"I've lived on the East Side but my preference is the West Side. Let's face\r\nit, Broadway's on the West Side. Where Broadway is is where my heart\r\nis.\" Flowers by Edith (69th and B'way) is one of Betsy's best-loved\r\nWestside establishments. \"I've become very good friends with her. I've\r\ngone to her house to parties.\"\r\n\r\nIn response to an obvious question, Betsy scolds gently: \"Never ask an\r\nactress what she's going to do next. Opera stars say, 'You know, I've got\r\nthis opera lined up, then this one, then this,' but an actress doesn't usually\r\nknow. ... I just hope that the next play I'm able to do will have a lot of\r\nhumanity in it, like this one. It's not enough to get a bunch of laughs.\r\nYou've got to be touched inside.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JAN PEERCE\r\nThe man with the golden voice\r\n\r\n3-22-80\r\n\r\nIn December 1979, in a benefit concert at the Alvin Theatre, about a\r\ndozen Broadway stars of the past and present strode to the microphone to\r\nsing some of the songs they made famous. John Raitt, Alan Jones, Jack\r\nGilford, Michael Moriarty, Delores Wilson and others received waves of\r\nenthusiastic applause from the packed house. But when a short, stocky,\r\nbarrel-chested man with thick eyeglasses and a nose like Jimmy Durante's\r\nshuffled to center stage, the audience didn't merely cheer: it erupted. And\r\nwhen 75-year-old Jan Peerce finished his two arias, he was prevailed upon\r\nto give the only encore of the evening. Appropriately enough, his choice\r\nwas \"If I Were a Rich Man\" from _Fiddler on the Roof_, the show in\r\nwhich he made his Broadway debut at the age of 67.\r\n\r\nAlthough Peerce has been one of America's most beloved singers for\r\nalmost half a century, it was not for sentimental reasons alone that he was\r\ntreated with such acclaim that evening. He still has one of the clearest,\r\nstrongest, sweetest tenor voices in the business, and his repertoire is\r\nenormous. Besides arias and showtunes, he performs ballads, German\r\nlieder, French contemporary songs, cantorial and oratory music\r\nwith equal facility. In order to keep his voice in top form, he now limits\r\nhis concerts to about 50 a year, but last summer, on a tour of Australia,\r\nhe did 17 concerts in 21 days.\r\n\r\n\"I vocalize every day of my life, I keep observing the laws of decent\r\nliving, and I face every booking as it was my first,\" he says in a recent\r\ntelephone interview, contacted at his Westside apartment. \"I believe in the\r\nadage that the show must go on, but you must not go out at the expense\r\nof your health, or impair the quality of your voice by singing against\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nThis fall will find him doing a one-man show at Carnegie Hall. In addition\r\nto his regular schedule of cross-country concerts, he makes cruises of the\r\nCaribbean several times each year aboard the SS Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nHis parents were Orthodox Jews who had immigrated from Russia, and\r\nthey were able to afford violin lessons for him by taking in lodgers at the\r\nLower East Side apartment where he grew up. Born under the name Jacob\r\nPincus Perelmuth, he began his career working primarily as a violinist and\r\nbandleader in the Catskills. In 1929 he married his childhood sweetheart,\r\nAlice Kalmanowitz, and three years later was discovered by the great\r\nshowman Samuel \"Roxy\" Rothafel, who hired him as a featured singer at\r\nthe new Radio City Music Hall.\r\n\r\n\"People on Broadway said I belonged in opera,\" recalls Peerce, \"and\r\nopera people said I belonged on Broadway. But when Roxy gave me my\r\nbreak, things began to happen. And then came Toscanini. He hired me to\r\nsing with his NBC Symphony of the Air. And when he accepted me, that\r\nsort of clinched things. People said, \"If he's good enough for Toscanini,\r\nthis guy must be good.'\"\r\n\r\nFor 15 years, Arturo Toscanini preferred Peerce to all other tenors in the\r\nworld. Meanwhile, in 1941, Peerce had joined the Metropolitan Opera.\r\nThere he sang the major tenor roles up until 1968, when, after losing the\r\nsight in one eye, he retired from the Met and began to concentrate on\r\nrecitals. In 1976 he published his memoirs, _The Bluebird of Happiness_,\r\nnamed after his recording that has sold 1.5 million copies. Peerce has\r\nmade dozens of other recordings, including many complete operas.\r\n\r\nA deeply religious man, long noted for his humanitarian efforts, Peerce\r\nis particularly supportive of Bonds for Israel. \"My wife Alice is the only\r\nwoman on the board of governors. She's the chairperson,\" he says\r\nproudly. \"It's to help Israel build and keep building, and develop to the\r\npoint where she belongs. She's growing beautifully, and she will grow\r\neven more.\"\r\n\r\nThe Peerces, who have two daughters and a son, maintain a house in New\r\nRochelle as well as the Westside apartment that they have had for the past\r\n15 years. Although Jan Peerce stopped playing the violin long ago, he is\r\nstill a dues-paying member of the local violinists' union. \"One day I asked\r\nthem if they could give me an honorary membership,\" he chuckles,\r\nrevealing his famous offbeat humor. \"They said they were very sorry,\r\nthey couldn't do it. I said why not, and they said, 'All our honorary\r\nmembers are dead.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother time, when he was the guest of honor at a dinner party, the\r\nhostess, seated next to him, chatted with such energy that Peerce had\r\ntrouble getting in a single word. He got his chance when the waiter\r\nbrought around a tray of assorted salad dressings. The gabby woman\r\nasked, \"Mr. Peerce, how do you usually eat your salad?\"\r\n\r\n\"In complete silence, madame,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nOf the dozens of conductors he has worked with, Peerce is quick to name\r\nToscanini his favorite. \"First of all, he was a great man, and second of\r\nall, he was a genius musically. He had no tricks, except that he had a\r\ncertain vision about the music. He made everybody sing or play as the\r\ncomposer meant it to be. And that was the secret of his success. He was\r\nan inspiration to anybody who worked with him or under him.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER GEORGE PLIMPTON\r\nAuthor, editor and adventurer\r\n\r\n2-2-79\r\n\r\nIt was an unusual statement to come from a man who has made a career\r\nout of fearing nothing. \"I'm scared to death every time I sit down at a\r\ntypewriter,\" confessed George Plimpton, who, in his 20 years as\r\nAmerica's foremost \"participatory journalist,\" has played football with the\r\nDetroit Lions, fought the light heavyweight champion of the world,\r\npitched to major league baseball players, raced cars internationally, and\r\nperformed with the New York Philharmonic as a percussionist.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes you can do it, and sometimes it's not there,\" continued\r\nPlimpton, leaning back in the desk chair at his Eastside apartment. \"It's\r\nvery hard to work alone. There's the television set, and all these books,\r\nand your son and daughter in the next room. Sometimes I have to get\r\naway. So I go to bars and I sit in a corner and write. You're trapped in\r\nthere. There's nothing else to do but write.\"\r\n\r\nAs we sat talking, the telephone rang frequently, and Plimpton,\r\napologizing for the interruption, spoke to the callers with widely varying\r\ndegrees of enthusiasm, but was consistently polite, urbane and witty. I\r\nnoticed a hint of an English accent in his voice -- the result of his early\r\neducation at St. Bernard's School on the Upper East Side, followed much\r\nlater by four years of study in England. It is easy to imagine him stepping\r\ninto a boxing ring like an English gentleman, calmly lacing on his gloves\r\nfor a friendly bout.\r\n\r\nWhich is precisely what he did in 1959 when, for the purpose of one of\r\nhis countless stories for _Sports Illustrated_, he took on Archie Moore,\r\nthen king of the light heavyweight division, for a three-round exhibition\r\nmatch in New York. Since that time, Plimpton has never lost his interest\r\nin boxing. A close friend of Muhammad Ali's who has followed the\r\nchampion around the world, he made Ali the chief character of his book\r\n_Shadow Box_, which came out in paperback this month from Berkley.\r\nAs with most of Plimpton's works, the story is told with an abundance of\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\nCurrently at work on three new books, Plimpton emphasized that he\r\nwrites on many subjects outside of sports. A lifelong friend of the\r\nKennedy family, he has co-authored an oral history volume titled\r\n_American Journey: The Times of Robert F. Kennedy_. He is an\r\nassociate editor of _Harper's_ magazine and a regular contributor to the\r\n_International Food & Wine Review_. His first love, in fact, seems to be\r\nnot sports at all, but the _Paris Review_, a magazine for up-and-coming\r\nserious writers that he has edited since its creation in 1953. One of the\r\nmost important literary magazines in the English-speaking world, the\r\n_Paris Review_ is published four times a year as a 175-page journal\r\ndevoted almost exclusively to fiction and poetry.\r\n\r\nHis hair is mostly silver now, and there are creases starting to appear on\r\nhis ruggedly handsome face, but Plimpton, at 52, is still the same larger\r\nthan-life, charismatic figure he has been since he came to national\r\nattention in 1961 with the publication of _Out of My League_, a book\r\nabout his foray into major league baseball. _Paper Lion_ (1966), which\r\ntold of his brief career as a quarterback with the Detroit Lions, cemented\r\nhis reputation as the nation's most realistic sportswriter. His other books\r\ninclude _The Bogey Man_, _One More July_, and _Mad Ducks and\r\nBears_. As a lecturer, he is in demand all over the country. He and his\r\nwife Freddy have been married for 11 years.\r\n\r\nBorn in New York City, he grew up around 98th Street and 5th Avenue,\r\nattended Harvard University (where he edited the _Harvard Lampoon_),\r\nand spent three years in the Army before heading for England to study at\r\nKing's College, Cambridge. During an Easter vacation there, he joined\r\nsome friends in Paris to discuss the launching of the literary magazine he\r\nhas guided ever since.\r\n\r\nIn 1979, said Plimpton with a grin, \"I'm supposed to manage the New\r\nYork Yankees for a day, and go through the whole procedure of being\r\nfired by George Steinbrenner. I hope it's followed by a beer commercial\r\nwith Billy Martin.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about his attachment to the East Side, Plimpton stressed his\r\nfondness for the city as a whole. \"In the last couple of years, there's been\r\nan enormous rebirth of excitement about living in the city. ... I think\r\nMayor [Ed] Koch has a lot to do with pulling it up. He seems to fit\r\neverywhere. If I saw him twirling up a pancake dough in a pizza shop on\r\nBroadway, or driving a 5th Avenue bus, or carrying a briefcase into 20\r\nExchange Place, I wouldn't be surprised. He's a quintessential New\r\nYorker.\"\r\n\r\nWhen my visit with Plimpton was about to end, I couldn't resist testing\r\nhim with my favorite sports question: \"Who was the only man to play for\r\nthe Boston Red Sox, the Boston Patriots and the Boston Bruins?\" He\r\ncouldn't guess. The answer, I told him, was a guy named John Kiley, who\r\nplayed the national anthem on the organ.\r\n\r\nBut Plimpton got the last word in.\r\n\r\n\"Who was the only man to play for the Boston Bruins and the Boston\r\nCeltics?\" he asked. I said I didn't know. He smiled and replied: \"George\r\nPlimpton.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER OTTO PREMINGER\r\nRebel filmmaker returns with _The Human Factor_\r\n\r\n1-26-80\r\n\r\nOn the cover of his 1977 autobiography _Preminger_, he is described as\r\n\"Hollywood's most tempestuous director\" and \"the screen's stormiest\r\nrebel.\" But today, at 73, the years appear to have caught up with Otto\r\nPreminger, the Austrian-born director and actor who came to the U.S. in\r\n1935 and met success after success, both in movies and on Broadway.\r\n\r\nHe became the first producer/director to make major motion pictures\r\nindependently of the giant studios, and with such films as _Forever\r\nAmber_, _The Moon is Blue_ and _The Man with the Golden Arm_, won\r\nprecedent-settling battles with censorship boards that established new\r\nartistic freedom for filmmakers.\r\n\r\nBetween 1959 and 1963 he produced and directed, in succession, _Porgy\r\nand Bess_, _Anatomy of a Murder_, _Exodus_, _Advice and Consent_,\r\nand _The Cardinal_. After that his career took a dip, and since 1971 he\r\nhas released but a single movie, _Rosebud_ (1975), which marked the\r\nscreenwriting debut of his son _Erik Lee Preminger_ and the acting debut\r\nof a New Yorker named John Lindsay, the city's former mayor.\r\n\r\nIn February, Preminger's 33rd film, _The Human Factor_, is scheduled\r\nto open in New York and across the country. Based on a best-selling\r\nnovel by Graham Greene, _The Human Factor_ is the suspenseful story\r\nof a black South African woman (played by fashion model Iman) who\r\nmarries a white secret agent (Nicol Williamson). Filmed mainly in the\r\nEnglish countryside, the movie deals with the agent's allegiance to the\r\nman who helps his wife to escape from South Africa. Persuaded to\r\nbecome a double agent, he ends up in Moscow, separated from the one\r\nperson he loves. The novel's title underlines the fact that bureaucracy can\r\nnever be all-powerful: there is always the human factor.\r\n\r\nPreminger, seated at his huge palette-shaped desk of white marble in the\r\nlavishly furnished projection room on the uppermost floor of his Eastside\r\ntown house, admits that he sank over $2 million of his own money into\r\nthe picture when his signed backers failed to come through. \"Everybody\r\nin Europe lies about money,\" says Preminger in his deep, German\r\naccented voice. \"I originally wanted to sue them, but suing doesn't make\r\nsense unless you are sure they have money. So I inquired from my Swiss\r\nlawyer, and they didn't have money in Switzerland. You see, in\r\nSwitzerland, the advantage of the Swiss law is that is you sue somebody,\r\nall his assets are frozen immediately. ... Luckily enough, I had two houses\r\nthat I wanted to sell in the south of France. ... At least I own the whole\r\nfilm. The question is now only: Will the picture be a big success as I\r\nhope, or not? That is always the main thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe nattily dressed Preminger, a tall, large man whose distinguished\r\nfeatures and totally bald head give the opposite impression of his slow\r\nmovement and somewhat frail appearance, revealed that the film's African\r\nscenes had to be shot in Kenya rather than South Africa \"because they\r\nsaid they must see what I am shooting, and if they don't like it, they will\r\nconfiscate it. They said, 'People in bed you can't shoot.' Then I went to\r\nKenya, where there is a black government, and they didn't even ask for\r\nthe script. They said I could have anything I want.\"\r\n\r\nAsked whether any memorable events took place during the filming,\r\nPreminger snaps, \"Even if there were, I don't remember. After I have\r\nmade a picture and I have seen it maybe two, three times with an\r\naudience, I deliberately detach myself, because I don't want it to influence\r\nmy next picture. As a matter of fact, a few months ago, my wife was\r\ndressing to go out, and I turned on the television and saw one of my old\r\npictures. I recognized it, but we had to leave before it was finished. I still\r\ndon't know how it ends.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Preminger's love life, he writes in his autobiography: \"I have a\r\nreputation with women which is not entirely deserved, though it is true\r\nthat I had my share of them, some of them stars.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1944 he had a three-week love affair with Gypsy Rose Lee that resulted\r\nin the birth of his son Erik Lee Preminger. The boy didn't find out the\r\nidentity of his real father until the age of 18. They were reunited four\r\nyears later, and liked each other immediately. Preminger legally adopted\r\nErik, who is currently in Los Angeles writing a biography of his late\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nPreminger and his third wife, a former costume designer named Hope\r\nBryce, to whom he has been married since 1959, are the parents of 19\r\nyear-old twins, Victoria and Mark. An Upper Eastsider for two decades,\r\nPreminger includes among his favorite restaurants Caravelle, Le Cirque\r\nand 21, where agent Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar once broke a glass over his\r\nhead that took 51 stitches to close.\r\n\r\nAn unabashed admirer of luxury, Preminger remains unruffled when\r\nquestioned about how his fancy Eastside pad is in line with the philosophy\r\nstated in his autobiography that \"my real reward is my work itself.\r\nSuccess matters only because without it, one cannot continue to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could live without it,\" he says with a shrug. \"I like to give my family\r\nluxuries, but I could easily live in one furnished room and be also happy.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER CHARLES RANGEL\r\nCongressman of the 19th District\r\n\r\n8-26-78\r\n\r\nThe dividing line of New York's 19th Congressional District twists and\r\nloops through upper Manhattan like a traveler who has lost his way. From\r\nthe corner of 62nd Street and Central Park West, the boundary turns\r\nsharply at Amsterdam Avenue and extends northward to 164th Street, then\r\nfollows the East River shoreline south to Roosevelt Island, taking in all of\r\nHarlem and a large chunk of the East Side.\r\n\r\nThis is the area that U.S. Congressman Charles Rangel has represented\r\never since he was sent to Washington in 1971, after defeating the colorful\r\nand controversial Adam Clayton Powell Jr. in the Democratic primary.\r\nToday, as firmly in control of the seat as Powell was during his height of\r\npopularity, Congressman Rangel stands virtually unopposed in his quest\r\nfor a fifth term.\r\n\r\n\"I have received the Democratic endorsement, the Republican\r\nendorsement, and the Liberal endorsement,\" says Rangel one Friday\r\nafternoon at the towering State Office Building on 125th Street. \"I am\r\nassuming that the Socialist Workers Party and the Communist Party will\r\nbe filing. They normally do. In the last election I got 96.4 percent of the\r\nvote.\"\r\n\r\nWhereas the late Powell had wide appeal only among the city's blacks,\r\nRangel gained the support of many Harlem residents plus a large majority\r\nof liberal whites on the upper West Side. It was they who provided him\r\nwith a 150-vote margin of victory over Powell in 1970. In the present\r\n95th Congress, Rangel has had the most liberal voting record of any\r\ncongressman from New York state. And while he has continued to give\r\na great deal of attention to Harlem's problems of health care,\r\nunemployment and drugs, Rangel has recently had more demands placed\r\non his time as a member of the powerful House Ways and Means\r\nCommittee. The first black ever to serve on the committee, he is currently\r\n11th in seniority and will be seventh in the next Congress.\r\n\r\nIn his New York office, where he generally spends two days per week,\r\nRangel appears surprisingly fresh and relaxed at the end of a working day.\r\nAs we settle into the interview, the elegantly dressed congressman with\r\nthe graying moustache and the rasping voice proves himself very much the\r\npolitician. He uses each question as a springboard to launch into his\r\nfavorite topics -- for example, his access to President Carter.\r\n\r\nBecause of his various committee assignments and his strong support of\r\nmost of Carter's policies, says Rangel, \"I am forced to meet with the\r\npresident more than probably many other members of Congress. I often\r\nstop by the White House on my way to the office.\" Rangel also likes to\r\ntalk about Chip Carter, the president's son, who is involved in a project\r\ncalled City in Schools, designed to upgrade the neighborhoods outside\r\ncertain schools. Chip has taken a special interest in Harlem, and one\r\nschool in particular near Morningside Park. \"I am confident that with\r\nChip Carter's help, and with my help, Morningside Park will soon show\r\nsome improvements. I hope that Columbia University will assist us too.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the unusual shape of the 19th Congressional District,\r\nRangel says, \"The reason for it is that as we find populations expanding,\r\nwe don't find the size or the numbers of the members of Congress\r\nexpanding. We used to have half a dozen members of Congress\r\nrepresenting different parts of Manhattan. Now we're down to three --\r\nme, Green, and Weiss. If you break it down, you can see that Adam\r\nClayton Powell's district used to be just Harlem.\"\r\n\r\nAs a member of the House Select Committee on Narcotics and Drugs,\r\nsays Rangel, \"I have gone to Moscow, to try to encourage them to do\r\nmore in the area of controlling opium. I have been to Thailand for the\r\nsame reason. ... That's one area in which I have great disappointment in\r\nthis administration. I find efforts of Nixon's to be greater than Carter's.\r\nThe Office of Drug Abuse was disbanded by Carter.\"\r\n\r\nAnother field in which he finds Carter at fault is health care. \"I support\r\nKennedy's proposal,\" said the congressman. \"There's no question that, for\r\nanti-inflation reasons, the president has put his national health program on\r\nthe back burner. But to think that any program could be directly controlled\r\nby economic needs rather than by the medical needs of the people is\r\nsomething I cannot accept.\"\r\n\r\nThe ultraliberal Rangel, one of the most vociferous supporters of U.S.\r\nAmbassador Andrew Young, still lives in the same building where he was\r\nborn 48 years ago, whenever he's not in Washington. He dropped out of\r\nhigh school to enlist in the Army and spent four years compiling a\r\ndistinguished service record, including a presidential citation and three\r\nbattle stars. Once he returned to New York, Rangel completed high\r\nschool, went to college, and entered law school on a full scholarship. He\r\nwas admitted to the bar in 1960; in 1966 he was elected to the first of two\r\nterms in the New York State Assembly.\r\n\r\nMarried and with two children, Congressman Rangel believes that his\r\nfuture lies primarily in the Ways and Means Committee, which handles\r\nsuch giant concerns as taxes, trade, health insurance, social security and\r\nwelfare. In order to maintain his popularity throughout the 19th\r\nCongressional District, he must continue to support those programs that\r\nbenefit his constituents in both Harlem and the Upper West Side. How can\r\nthis be done? \"If we're going to use the tax system to make incentives for\r\nthe business community to help the economy,\" he replies, \"we need to\r\nbring the disadvantaged into the mainstream.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JOE RAPOSO\r\nGolden boy of American composers\r\n\r\n2-23-80\r\n\r\nSing, sing a song\r\nSing out loud, sing out strong\r\nSing of good things, not bad\r\nSing of happy, not sad\r\nSing, sing a song\r\nMake it simple\r\nTo last your whole life long\r\nDon't worry that it's not good enough\r\nFor anyone else to hear\r\nJust sing, sing a song.\r\n\r\nJoe Raposo wrote those words, along with their music, on a January\r\nmorning in New York City, about 10 years ago. \"It was,\" he recalls, \"as\r\nsuccinctly and as economically and precisely as I could embody a\r\nphilosophy of life in a song. 'Sing' is my philosophy of life, period. ...\r\nI remember leaving the studio and walking up Sixth Avenue saying, 'If\r\nthat isn't a hit song, I know absolutely nothing about it.'\"\r\n\r\nThe boyish, roly-poly, 40-year-old songwriter, whose incredibly crowded\r\ncareer has included the writing of five movie scores and more than 350\r\nsongs recorded by the likes of Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Tony\r\nBennett and Tom Jones, was right about \"Sing.\" When Karen Carpenter's\r\nsingle went platinum in 1974, that was only the beginning.\r\n\r\n\"It's one of the most recorded songs in the world,\" says Joe. \"I think\r\nthere are something like 180 versions of it, in just about every major\r\nlanguage. ... Lawrence Welk recently did this hit parade of songs of the\r\ndecade, and the number one song of the decade was 'Sing.'\"\r\n\r\nWe're riding in a limousine along Fifth Avenue. Joe has requested to be\r\ninterviewed while he attends to some gift shopping. Because of a\r\ntemporary leg injury, he has hired a limousine for the afternoon. As we\r\ngo from store to store, Joe greets the merchants by name, then answers\r\nquestions into a tape recorder while waiting for his merchandise.\r\n\r\nLong noted for his musical versatility, Raposo grew up in Fall River,\r\nMassachusetts, the only child of a classical musician father and a piano\r\nplaying mother. \"I learned counterpoint at the age of 6 or so by wandering\r\naround the concert hall as my father rehearsed Mozart.\" His parents\r\ntaught him piano, violin and bass viol. At Harvard University he began\r\nto write and direct his own musicals. Soon after moving to New York\r\nCity in 1966, he had all the work he could handle as musical director,\r\ncomposer and lyricist for both television and the stage. He is the recipient\r\nof three Emmy Awards and an Oscar nomination. As a record producer,\r\nhe has won four Grammy Awards.\r\n\r\n\"It's Not Easy Bein' Green,\" one of many songs he wrote for the _Sesame\r\nStreet_ TV show, has become the international anthem for the Girl Scouts\r\nof America. Another Raposo hit, \"You Will Be My Music,\" brought\r\nSinatra out of retirement several years ago. His _Sesame Street Fever_\r\ndisco album has sold more than a million copies.\r\n\r\nAn album of all-Raposo music recorded by the Boston Pops in 1976 led\r\nto a commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra for an orchestral\r\nand choral work. The result is a 12-to-14-minute oratorio titled _From the\r\nDiary of Johann Sutter_, about the man whose quiet farm became the\r\nepicenter of the California Gold Rush.\r\n\r\n\"It's the darndest story ever. Because it tells how a man who's a\r\ntremendous idealist came to this country from Switzerland to found a new\r\nutopian agrarian state, with cattle and fields of grain, and vineyards. ...\r\nWhen the Gold Rush started, Sutter's whole society was ruined. And it is\r\nan incredible parallel for our time, in that our pursuit of material goods\r\ntends to make us forget all the natural, beautiful things that surround us.\r\n\r\n\"Sheldon Harnick has done a wonderfully literate libretto. It premieres\r\nthis spring in Boston. Sheldon and I have been talking about the possibility\r\nof expansion, but we have a musical to write first based on _It's A\r\nWonderful Life_, the Frank Capra movie.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Raposo is collaborating with Hal David on another\r\nmusical and writing songs for a sequel to _The Muppet Movie_. But with\r\nall his success, Joe admits to having \"a trunk of songs that are\r\nunrecorded, and many of them I feel are right up on a par with anything\r\nI've ever done. But they sit there and nobody grabs them. You have to\r\nwait. ... A lot of people think, 'Oh, if I only had the talent to write a hit\r\nsong.' But writing a great song isn't enough: you have to get the right\r\nrecording at the right time.\"\r\n\r\nApart from being a creative artist and a practical businessman, Joe has an\r\nactive family life. Married for the past four years to beautiful Pat Collins\r\nof ABC-TV's _Good Morning America_, he has custody of two sons from\r\na previous marriage. The eldest, 16-year-old Joseph, is already making\r\nwaves as a bass player, both electric and orchestral. Joe and Pat also have\r\na 3-year-old daughter of their own.\r\n\r\nAn admirer of President Carter since 1975, Joe wrote the music for\r\nCarter's campaign song the following year, and has done so again for\r\n1980.\r\n\r\nIn his infrequent spare time Joe loves \"tinkering -- banging nails into\r\nthings, and building stuff. I'm a pretty handy carpenter, a fair electrician.\"\r\nWith a mischievous smile he adds: \"As a matter of fact, sometimes I think\r\nI should go into that full-time, because the music business is chancy.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MASON REESE\r\nNot just another kid\r\n\r\n6-4-77\r\n\r\n\"Mason, I've got two very very important pieces of advice to give you,\"\r\nMilton Berle told the youngster when they first met. \"Don't believe in\r\nHollywood party promises; and practice, practice and rehearse.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Miltie's words have been a useful lesson for Mason Reese, the boy\r\nwonder of television. In 1973, at the age of 7, Mason skyrocketed to fame\r\nby winning a Clio Award for best male in a TV commercial. In the same\r\nyear he co-hosted the _Mike Douglas Show_ for a week and became a\r\nchildren's reporter for WNBC-TV. His picture appeared in _Time_,\r\n_Newsweek_, and on the cover of _TV Guide_. Mason's unique face and\r\nvoice became known to millions.\r\n\r\nSince that time, however, there have been a few disappointments mixed\r\nin with the triumphs. At 11, Mason is wiser and more philosophical about\r\nshow business. Along with his parents, he has learned not to place faith\r\nin verbal agreements, as Berle cautioned.\r\n\r\nThe Reeses welcome me into their West End Avenue home. As I take a\r\nseat beside the \"borgasmord kid\" and look around me at the Chagall\r\nprints, Bill and Sonia, Mason's parents, pull up armchairs to listen in and\r\nhelp out.\r\n\r\nBut during the interview, Mason needs no more help with his answers\r\nthan he did with his first audition at age 5, when he beat out 600 other\r\nchildren to become the spokesman for Ivory Snow. After that he endorsed\r\nsuch products as Ralston Purina, Thick and Frosty, and Underwood Meat\r\nSpread, winning a total of seven Clios to date. He's been co-host with\r\nMike Douglas for three weeks and has appeared as a television guest with\r\ncountless other celebrities.\r\n\r\nOne of my first questions is about children's rights. \"I think children have\r\nenough rights as it is,\" he says. \"They're with their families, they go to\r\nschool, they have the pleasure of learning. ... and they realize that when\r\nthey grow up they'll be able to have more and more fun, as long as they\r\ndon't go on a mad rampage when they're kids.\"\r\n\r\nWhich type of people are most likely to grab him or pick him up? \"It's\r\nalways the middle-aged Italian ladies and the Jewish grandmothers,\" he\r\nsays authoritatively. \"Some people don't want to treat a kid like a human\r\nbeing. They want them like a puppy dog; instead of petting, it's\r\npinching.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it comes time to talk about Mason's not-so-successful ventures, Bill\r\n-- a producer of audiovisual shows and an expert in 3-D design work --\r\ntakes over. He tells about the Broadway show that was written and ready\r\nto go, with Mason as one of the leads, that folded up and disappeared\r\nwithout warning or explanation. He tells about the ABC pilot titled\r\n_Mason_, which cost $250,000 to make and was never televised; about\r\nthe movie offers that were never followed through; about the _Howard\r\nCosell Show_ -- with Mason as co-host -- that was canceled shortly after\r\nit began.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these setbacks, Mason recently did some Munchkins\r\ncommercials for Dunkin' Donuts and will go to California this summer to\r\ndo some ads for Birdseye frozen french fries.\r\n\r\nWhile the Reeses remain optimistic about the future, they try not to build\r\nup their hopes on a new project unless it is something solid. For show\r\nbusiness is, after all, a business.\r\n\r\nMason has lived on the West Side for all of his 11 years. \"I don't seem\r\nto understand why everyone thinks the East Side is classier,\" he says. \"I\r\nthink they're friendlier people on the West Side, because people on the\r\nEast Side get snobby. Most of my friends are on the West Side.\"\r\n\r\nHis favorite eating places? \"I love the Greek restaurants -- the Four\r\nBrothers (87th & Broadway) and the Argo (72nd & Columbus). Greeks\r\nare okay, aren't they mom? I like restaurants that are a little bit dumpy,\r\nwithout much decor.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I run out of questions, I ask Mason if there are any other comments\r\nhe wants to make. \"I think you've asked what everyone else has asked,\"\r\nhe replies honestly. And then with a smile: \"Except that I've given you\r\ndifferent answers.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, there's one thing,\" he goes on. \"I'd like my allowance raised to\r\nfive dollars.\" Then, leaning back on the, sofa looking as content as a man\r\ncelebrating his 100th birthday, he adds: \"I've really had no gripes in life.\r\nExcept that I'd like people to stop calling me a midget, and to stop\r\npinching me.\"\r\n\r\nSome people who have never met Mason Reese in person unfairly assume\r\nthat he is a spoiled brat with pushy, exploitive parents. In fact, Bill and\r\nSonia are warm, creative people who are fully aware of the great\r\nresponsibility they have in bringing up their extraordinary son. Mason is\r\nnot only brilliant, but a gentleman. He should be making movies, and with\r\na bit of luck, he will be, soon. Having met him, I can only repeat -- not\r\nimprove on -- the words of Tony Randall: \"I tell you this with neither\r\nhesitation nor embarrassment. ... I'm a fan of his for life.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER MARTY REISMAN\r\nAmerica's best-loved ping-pong player\r\n\r\n6-10-78\r\n\r\nMarty Reisman was ready for _The Tonight Show_. But was _The\r\nTonight Show_ ready for Marty Reisman?\r\n\r\nIn a recent TV appearance, his name was announced and he started across\r\nthe stage toward the desk of guest host John Davidson. Then suddenly he\r\nseemed to get lost in the floodlights. For a few seconds the television\r\naudience didn't know what was happening. An anonymous cameraman\r\nraced out of the wings to guide Marty to his destination.\r\n\r\n\"My gosh, that's never happened before,\" laughed Davidson. But Marty's\r\nhumorous stumbling may well have been part of his act because, as\r\nAmerica's best-loved table tennis player, he very often does things that\r\nhaven't been done before. On _The Tonight Show_ he returned shots with\r\nhis foot and behind his back, broke a cigarette with his slam shot (that has\r\nbeen clocked at 105 miles per hour), and soon had Davidson sprawled\r\nacross the table trying to reach shots that came back of their own.\r\n\r\nAt 48, Reisman (rhymes with \"policeman\") is still the nation's highest\r\npaid Ping-Pong player in exhibitions. The stunts that he has developed\r\nover the past 30 years make his games pure entertainment. But Marty is\r\nmore than a player; he is a personality, a man with a thousand stories to\r\ntell, and an instant friend to the people who visit his table tennis center on\r\n96th Street just west of Broadway.\r\n\r\n\"I feel I'm moving with the times,\" he remarks, late one evening at the\r\ncenter. \"When from an athletic professional point of view some people\r\nwould think about retirement, my career is on the point of fresh\r\nblossoming.\" He is referring to the fact that his autobiography, _The\r\nMoney Player_, published in 1974, is now being converted into a movie\r\nscript. And other things are happening. Several months ago his table\r\ntennis parlor was the scene of a unique recording session -- a piece of\r\nmusic titled _Tournament Overture for Flute, Cello, Synthesizer, and Two\r\nPing-Pong Players_, composed especially for Reisman. The event was\r\nfollowed by a regular tournament. And this fall Marty has a long-range\r\nexhibition tour lined up.\r\n\r\n\"I started playing on the Lower East Side, about 1942,\" he says. \"A year\r\nlater, at the age of 13, I was the New York City Junior Champion. ... At\r\n17, I represented the United States in the World Championship which was\r\nheld in London, at Wembley Stadium. There were 10,000 people\r\nwatching. I lost in the quarterfinals. ... The next year I made it to the\r\nsemifinals and received a rating of number three in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThat year, 1949, was probably the peak of Marty's career from a purely\r\nathletic standpoint, although he was good enough to win the U.S.\r\nChampionship in 1958 and 1960. What distinguishes him from other\r\nplayers, however, is the variety and richness of his experiences in the\r\nworld of Ping-Pong. For three years he toured with the Harlem\r\nGlobetrotters as their star attraction at halftime. He spent several years in\r\nthe Far East as well, and was in Hanoi when the French were defeated at\r\nDien Bien Phu. Altogether he has played in 65 countries, and has picked\r\nup such titles as South American Champion, Canadian Champion, and\r\nBritish Champion.\r\n\r\nHe once taught the game to a chimpanzee; the chimp managed to return\r\nthe ball up to four times in a row. \"But the most astounding thing about\r\nhim,\" recalls Marty, \"was his short span of attention. When the ball was\r\nabout an inch from his racket, he'd turn his head away and get smacked\r\nin the face.\"\r\n\r\nAs the title of his autobiography indicates, Marty has also been known to\r\nplace a wager on occasion. \"I've hustled when I've had to,\" he confesses.\r\n\"But it hasn't been my way of life. I don't misrepresent myself. I play\r\nagainst the best players in the world, all over the world. Wherever I am,\r\nI create the drama, the action, the excitement, because of the large sums\r\nof money I bet.\" In one of his biggest hustles he flew to Omaha,\r\nNebraska, under the guise of a baby crib salesman, to help a man who had\r\nbeen hustled himself. Reisman played for $1,000 a game and emerged\r\nfrom the contest 14 games ahead.\r\n\r\nWest 96th Street has long been a hotbed of table tennis activity. A Ping\r\nPong parlor opened there in 1934, and Marty took it over in 1958. Today,\r\nmany of the world's great players stop by for a game when they visit New\r\nYork. Dustin Hoffman, Walter Matthau, Bobby Fischer and Art Carney\r\nhave played there also. Marty's regular customers range from 8-year-old\r\nboys to a man of 83 who plays twice a week. The center opens in the\r\nafternoon and doesn't close until 3:30 in the morning, seven days a week.\r\n\"I live on the West Side and so do most of my friends,\" says Marty.\r\n\r\nA man has been standing nearby during the interview; Marty introduces\r\nhim as Bill, his former manager.\r\n\r\n\"Manager?\" snorts the man with a gruff smile. \"He can't be managed.\r\nHuman beings can be managed, but Reisman is something different. If he\r\nsays 'I'll be there at 3 o'clock' he might show up at 4 -- the next day.\r\nBut,\" he concedes, \"if Marty didn't have those idiosyncracies, he wouldn't\r\nhave those rare talents.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER RUGGIERO RICCI\r\nWorld's most-recorded violinist\r\n\r\n3-3-79\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, October 20, 1929. Four days later, on Black Thursday,\r\nWall Street would be rocked by the biggest losses in its history and the\r\nnation would be plunged into its greatest crisis since the Civil War. But\r\nOctober 20 still belonged to the Roaring Twenties, and on that date the\r\nmost highly publicized event to take place in Manhattan was a violin\r\nconcert by a 9-year-old wunderkind named Ruggiero Ricci, who delivered\r\na flawless performance of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto and was\r\nlauded as a genius by the city's leading music critics. That concert made\r\nRicci's career; in the 10 years that followed, the boy virtuoso earned an\r\nannual salary higher than that of the president of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe story might have ended there, but unlike most prodigies, who burn\r\nthemselves out early, Ruggiero Ricci has continued to grow in stature as\r\nan artist. Since the 1940s he has been considered one of the greatest living\r\nviolinists, and, with more than 500 recordings to his credit, he is the\r\nmost-recorded soloist, instrumental or vocal, in the world today.\r\nEspecially in demand abroad, he has made five trips to Australia and three\r\nto the Soviet Union, where he was obliged to play nine encores at his\r\ndebut appearance. Twenty of his concerts in West Germany were sold out\r\na year in advance, and more than a dozen of his South American tours\r\nhave been sellouts as well.\r\n\r\n\"I travel most of the year, except maybe a month off in the summer,\" says\r\nRicci, a short, good-humored man of 60 with large, sparkling eyes, jet\r\nblack brows, and a soft, slightly accented voice that sounds as if he were\r\nborn in Europe. He sits curled up in a corner of the couch in his\r\nmagnificent Westside apartment. \"I dislike to travel. In the old days, there\r\nwere a lot of airplane breakdowns, and we were always hung up in\r\nairports waiting for them to fix the plane. Today they have all these\r\nhijacking searches. You have to go through the machines; they have these\r\nenormous lines. And when you get to the hotel, there's a line a mile\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\nHe believes that Russian audiences are \"the best public in the world. They\r\ndon't applaud between the movements, like they do in New York. ... It's\r\nalways interesting to visit a place for the first time. I don't want to go to\r\nRussia so much anymore. We found out it's boring. There's nothing to\r\ndo. And it's not much fun. There's no tipping, so the hotel service is very\r\nbad. It takes an hour to get breakfast; you can sit there and be completely\r\nignored by the waiter. To make a telephone call: it's easier to go to the\r\nmoon.\"\r\n\r\nRicci's repertoire, which includes more than 60 concertos from the 17th\r\nto the 20th centuries, is the largest of any violinist's now before the\r\npublic. This calls for a lot of practice. \"When you're a kid,\" says Ricci,\r\n\"you hate to practice. And when you're a grownup, practice is a pleasure.\r\nIt lets you escape all the other junk. ... I don't have any trouble practicing\r\nin this building, because the old buildings have heavy walls. But if you\r\nwant to practice in a hotel, that's hard. Sometimes you can use a mute. Or\r\nyou turn on the television. Then they don't complain. If they hear a\r\nfiddle, they complain.\"\r\n\r\nRicci has two major concerts in New York this year. The first will take\r\nplace at Carnegie Hall on Saturday, March 3, when Ricci will join such\r\ncelebrities as Andres Segovia, Yehudi Menuhin, Jose Ferrer, Jean-Pierre\r\nRampal, and Peter Ustinov for a historic musical program to\r\ncommemorate the 15th anniversary of Symphonicum Europae, a\r\nfoundation whose aim is to promote international understanding and\r\ncooperation by sponsoring performances in every country.\r\n\r\nRicci's other New York concert will mark another anniversary. It will be\r\non October 20th -- 50 years to the day since he took the city by storm.\r\n\"The early concerts I remember very well,\" says the maestro, who was\r\nborn in San Francisco to a family of Italian immigrants. \"For most\r\nprodigies, the problem is the parents. My father just wasn't every smart\r\nabout how to handle me. Nowadays they don't have prodigies anymore\r\nbecause there isn't any profit in it. In the old days, a kid could get $2,500\r\nto $3000 dollars a night. Everybody had their kid study.\"\r\n\r\nNone of his five children has turned out to be a prodigy, but three of them\r\nare already professionals in the performing arts. Ricci's slender, attractive\r\nwife, Julia, is an active participant in his career. Westsiders for many\r\nyears, the Riccis enjoy such local restaurants as La Tablita, Alfredo's and\r\nthe Cafe des Artistes.\r\n\r\nAsked what he likes best about his career, Ricci says it is making\r\nrecordings. \"It's more leisurely. You don't have all the headaches. ... The\r\nnewest development is direct-to-disc records. The music goes straight\r\nfrom the mike into the cutting head master, and there's no way to erase.\r\nIf it's a 20-minute recording and you make a mistake on the 19th minute,\r\nyou have to start over. I just finished recording the _Paganini Caprices_\r\non direct-to-disc. It's coming out this month. The caprices are very rarely\r\nperformed in public, because they're so difficult.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER BUDDY RICH\r\nMonarch of the drums\r\n\r\n1-5-80\r\n\r\n\"Mediocrity has no place in my life,\" says fast-talking, hard-driving\r\nBuddy Rich, wrapped in a bathrobe at his luxurious Westside apartment.\r\n\"Anybody who is expert at what they do, I admire, whether it's\r\ndrumming, tennis, or whatever. If they do it at the top of their form,\r\nconstantly, I become a fan.\"\r\n\r\nDragging deeply on his cigarette, the man whom critics and fellow jazz\r\nartists have frequently called the greatest drummer in the world -- perhaps\r\nof all time -- dismisses such labels with something approaching\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think anybody is the best of anything in the world. Babe Ruth's\r\nrecord was broken, Joe Louis was knocked out. ... I'd rather not be the\r\nworld's greatest anything. I'd rather be what I am, which is a good\r\ndrummer.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an unexpected statement to come from a bandleader and drummer\r\nknown more for arrogance than modesty, but in an hour-long interview,\r\nBuddy's complex personality unfolds itself in all its richness, and he\r\nproves to be far more than a flamboyant, free-thinking musician who pulls\r\nno punches.\r\n\r\nIn Buddy's hands, a snare drum comes to life: it whispers, shouts, purrs,\r\nsnarls, chuckles, gasps or roars, as the mood of the music strikes him. He\r\nbegan playing in 1921 at the age of 4, when his parents -- vaudeville\r\nactors from Brooklyn -- included him in their act and then made him the\r\nstar. By the age of 7 he had toured the world as \"Traps, the Drum\r\nWonder.\" At 15, he was second only to Jackie Coogan as the highest-paid\r\nchild performer in America. He began recording in 1937, joined bands\r\nheaded by Artie Shaw and Tommy Dorsey, and finally formed his own\r\nband in 1946. Over the next 20 years, as both a drummer/bandleader and\r\nas the highest-paid sideman in the business, he made hundreds of\r\nrecordings with some of the biggest names in the history of jazz -- Charlie\r\nParker, Dizzy Gillespie, Oscar Peterson, Lionel Hampton, Count Basie,\r\nHarry James, Thelonius Monk.\r\n\r\nThen in 1966 he formed his current band, the 15-man Buddy Rich\r\nOrchestra. In December he brought the band to the chic, newly remodeled\r\nGrand Finale on West 70th Street. Seated at his drums in the center of the\r\norchestra, he effortlessly mixes snare, tom-tom, bass drum and cymbals\r\nin a whirling, benumbing mass of sound.\r\n\r\nBack in his huge living room, which is decorated much like a summer\r\nhouse in Newport, Rhode Island, Buddy says that his nightclub gigs are\r\nrare. \"We do about nine months on the road, which includes Europe and\r\nthe Orient. All the cities of this country. Most of the tours I'm on are 90\r\npercent concert halls and schools. ... The main reason is educational. It's\r\ngood for the young people to discover all of a sudden that music isn't just\r\na guitar and a drum and a bad out-of-tune singer. ... I think as young\r\npeople become more sophisticated in their tastes, they begin to realize that\r\njazz is just as high an art form as classical music.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his chief gripes about jazz in America, he explains in a voice as\r\nrough as sandpaper, is that \"during the season you might see 15 or 20\r\naward shows on television dedicated to country and western slop, but\r\nyou'll never see a jazz presentation in its true form. When there's an\r\nextended piece of music, they usually cloud it up with dancing girls and\r\ntrick lighting and anything that distracts from the music, instead of\r\npresenting the music as the attraction, the way they do in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nAnother sore spot is the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. \"I'm heavily into\r\nsports cars; I used to race long ago. I find that the restrictions placed on\r\nus today are insane, contradictory, and hypocritical. ... I don't know\r\nanyone on the highway who actually does 55 miles an hour, and it's just\r\nanother way of making money for the state or the local community, and\r\nI think it's no better than a *ing stickup!\"\r\n\r\nHe doesn't keep any drums in the apartment, and never practices. \"I want\r\nmy days to be as a man, and I want my nights to be as a working man.\r\nIn the day, I exercise, I do karate -- I have a black belt -- and totally\r\ndisengage myself from the person I am at night.\" His apartment is shared\r\nby Buddy's wife Marie and their 25-year-old daughter Cathy, a singer.\r\n\r\n\"My wife is just as beautiful today as she was the day I married her,\"\r\nBuddy says proudly. \"She used to be in pictures, but she gave it up when\r\nwe married. Now she's a wife and a female and a woman, and she's not\r\ninto ERA and she's not into 'I got my thing man and you got your thing.'\r\nShe's a woman, and wears dresses so that I know she's a woman. That's\r\nwhat I like.\"\r\n\r\nHe often performs free at prisons and hospitals, but refuses to give details.\r\n\"I do these things for the good that it does for me,\" he asserts. \"To have\r\nsomeone write about it takes the goodness away from it. I'd rather not\r\nhave anybody know what I do as long as I know.\"\r\n\r\nBuddy suffered a heart attack in 1959 and has had others since, but apart\r\nfrom giving up liquor, he has made few adjustments in his whirlwind\r\nlifestyle. \"I really don't think of past illnesses,\" he declares. \"I think I'm\r\nhealthier and stronger today than I've ever been in my life. I smoke more\r\nnow, and I run around more, and I do more exercise. I don't put too\r\nmuch reality into warnings about 'don't do this and don't do that.' Do\r\nwhat you have to do, and do it. If you cut out -- it was time.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER GERALDO RIVERA\r\nBroadcaster, author and humanitarian\r\n\r\n6-2-79\r\n\r\n>From hundreds of local television stations across the nation, many\r\npersonalities have risen up through the ranks to become national figures\r\non network, but few have risen to far or so fast as Geraldo Rivera.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, the year he graduated from Brooklyn Law School, Rivera\r\ndecided to become a poor people's lawyer, and over the next 12 months\r\nhe took part in 50 trials, most of them in criminal courts. Then his career\r\ntook an abrupt turn: in June 1970 he was offered a job at WABC-TV's\r\n_Eyewitness News_, and Rivera quickly accepted. His aggressive, probing\r\nstyle, matchless reportorial skills, and charismatic presence gained him the\r\nAssociated Press' first-place citation as top newsman of 1971 -- an award\r\nhe received three more times in the next four years.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 he became the traveling co-host of _Good Morning America_ on\r\nABC network; in the 20 months that followed, his assignments took him\r\nto more than two dozen countries. Continuing his upward climb, he was\r\nnext transferred to the _ABC Evening News_ with Barbara Walters and\r\nHarry Reasoner. Finally in 1978, he was named to his present position --\r\nas special correspondent for _20/20_, ABC's weekly hour-long news\r\nmagazine show.\r\n\r\nOver the past nine years, Rivera's special reports have earned him\r\nvirtually all the major awards in broadcast journalism, including several\r\nEmmys. It was one of his earliest documentaries, however, that brought\r\nhim the most recognition. Titled _Willowbrook: The Last Great\r\nDisgrace_, the 1972 expose focused on the conditions at Staten Island's\r\nWillowbrook institution for the mentally retarded. The broadcast resulted\r\nin an unprecedented response from viewers. So many offers of assistance\r\npoured in that Rivera was able to set up a national organization known as\r\nOne to One, whose goal is to give ongoing, individualized attention to\r\nretarded persons. Since 1973, One to One has raised more than $2\r\nmillion, and helped to build almost 60 group homes throughout the New\r\nYork metropolitan area, each housing approximately 12 retarded persons\r\nof the same general age range.\r\n\r\nOn June 6 from 8 to 10:30 p.m., One to One will present a TV special\r\nthat will combine top entertainment with personal accounts of retarded\r\npeople, their parents, and the role of the media in helping to shape public\r\nawareness. The entertainers include Paul McCartney and Wings, Neil\r\nSedaka, Debby Boone, Ed Asner, Angela Lansbury and the Captain &\r\nTennille. Geraldo Rivera shares the emceeing chores with his ABC\r\ncolleague John Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"The show will be both taped and live,\" says Rivera in an interview at his\r\nWest 60th Street office. \"We've designed the program so that it's not a\r\nclassic telethon where every two seconds they say, 'Please send us your\r\nmoney.'\"\r\n\r\nAmong the more dramatic moments is a tape of the Seventh Annual Wall\r\nStreet Charity Fund Boxing Match, which raised thousands of dollars for\r\nOne to One. \"For the first year, I'm not the main event,\" comments\r\nRivera, who scored a technical knockout over his opponent in 1978. \"My\r\nnose was broken last year, and they took out all the scar tissue. They\r\ndecided that my nose had given enough for the cause.\"\r\n\r\nHe learned most of his boxing \"just street fighting growing up.\" Born 35\r\nyears ago on the Lower East Side to a Puerto Rican father and a Jewish\r\nmother, he was christened Gerald Rivers and hispanicized his name while\r\nin college. There are no scars on his ruggedly handsome face. With his\r\nneatly styled hair, easy smile, and air of casual masculinity -- one of his\r\nfavorite outfits is a denim jacket over a T-shirt -- Rivera could easily pass\r\nfor a professional athlete turned matinee idol. Yet it is primarily his\r\nliterary ability, combined with a sentimentality backed up by facts, that\r\nhas made him a type of media folk hero. His documentaries have earned\r\nhim 78 humanitarian awards.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his more than 3,000 news stories, Rivera has written four\r\nbooks, including one on Willowbrook. \"I've been back there many times,\r\nand it still stinks -- literally and figuratively,\" says Rivera in his\r\ncustomary vibrant tone. \"But it's now a much smaller place. Willowbrook\r\nstarted with 6,500 people, and now it's well under a thousand. It has\r\nbecome, in fact, one of the better institutions. But institutions are not the\r\nanswer. There's no such thing as a good big institution.\"\r\n\r\nWith his commitments as chairman of One to One, his heavy travel\r\nschedule for _20/20_, and his new daily commentary on ABC Radio,\r\nRivera likes to spend free evenings at home with his wife Sheri at their\r\napartment near Lincoln Center. A Westsider since 1975, he names the\r\nGinger Man and the Cafe des Artistes as his favorite dining spots.\r\n\r\nAsked about the biggest difference between his present career and his\r\nearlier career as a lawyer, Rivera says: \"Now I have the power to cause\r\npositive change in a dramatic way. When you have an audience of tens of\r\nmillions of people, it's a multiple in terms of influence and impact, and\r\nthe effective delivery of information. As a broadcaster, I've found that one\r\nperson can make a difference.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER NED ROREM\r\nAuthor and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer\r\n\r\n6-17-78\r\n\r\nThe world has always been fascinated by artists who excel in more than\r\none field. There was Richard Wagner, for example, who wrote the words\r\nand the music to all his operas. Cole Porter and Bob Dylan are two others\r\nwho have proven their mastery of both language and composition.\r\n\r\nBut while these three men combined their talents to produce great songs,\r\nNed Rorem has employed his musical and literary gifts in a different way.\r\nBy keeping the two separate, he has gained a huge reputation as a\r\ncomposer of serious music and also as a prose writer of formidable style.\r\nIn 1976 he won the Pulitzer Prize for music. And last month Simon and\r\nSchuster published his eighth book, _An Absolute Gift_.\r\n\r\nAt 54, Rorem has become somewhat of a fixture on the New York artistic\r\nscene, who no longer sparks the controversy that he once did. But in\r\nParis, where he spent nine years during his early career in the 1950s,\r\nRorem was as well-known for his socializing as for his music. With his\r\nhandsome, youthful good looks and boyish charm, his biting wit, and his\r\nwide knowledge of the arts, he became a close companion of many of the\r\nleading literary and musical figures of France.\r\n\r\nHis recollections of those years were carefully recorded in his first book,\r\n_The Paris Diary_, published in 1966 amid fanfare on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic. It was quickly followed by _The New York Diary_, which was\r\nmore popular still. Since then, Rorem's books have appeared at fairly\r\nregular intervals, all of them either diaries or essays, or a combination of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nIn print, Rorem comes across as being somewhat disillusioned with life\r\nand art. In person, however, he is a warm, sincere host. With a tendency\r\ntoward shyness that does not come through in his books. Rorem makes all\r\nof his remarks so matter-of-factly that nothing he says seems vicious or\r\noutrageous.\r\n\r\nLeaning back on the sofa of his large Westside apartment, with one hand\r\nresting against his chin and the other stroking his pet cat Wallace, Rorem\r\nanswers one of the first questions saying that yes, he is upset by the\r\nnegative review that _An Absolute Gift_ received in the _New York\r\nTimes_.\r\n\r\n\"A bad review in the Times can kill a book,\" he explains. \"It killed my\r\nlast book. And I don't think it's fair that they gave my new book to the\r\nsame reviewer. He made some of the same statements that he did last\r\ntime, with almost the same wording. But just today I got a very good\r\nreview from the _Washington Post_. And I hope there will be something\r\nin the _New York Review of Books_. That's even more important than\r\nthe _Times_.\"\r\n\r\nRorem is considerably more versatile as a composer than as a writer. His\r\noutput includes five operas, three symphonies, and \"literally hundreds of\r\nvocal pieces for solo voice and ensembles of various sizes. And\r\ninstrumental music of every description.\" He is considered by many to be\r\nthe world's greatest living composer of art songs. Generally he sets other\r\npeople's words to music. Asked for the definition of an art song, Rorem\r\nsays, \"I hate the term. I composed dozens of arts songs before ever\r\nhearing the word. It's a song sung by a trained singer in concert halls.\"\r\n\r\nThe piece that won him the Pulitzer, surprisingly, was not a song at all,\r\nbut an orchestral work titled _Air Music_, which was commissioned for\r\nthe U.S. Bicentennial by the late Thomas Schippers and the Cincinnati\r\nSymphony. This summer the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene\r\nOrmandy will premiere a new, major composition of Rorem's, _Sunday\r\nMorning_.\r\n\r\n\"I feel very, very, very lucky that I'm able to support myself as a\r\ncomposer of serious music,\" he says. \"My income is not so much from\r\nroyalties as from commissions, prizes, fellowships, and official handouts,\r\nsuch as the National Endowment of the Arts, and the Guggenheim\r\nFellowship, which I now am living on.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Indiana and raised in Chicago, Rorem began composing music at\r\nthe age of 10. He was never attracted to pop music, and today he likes it\r\nless than ever. \"Inasmuch as pop music goes hand in hand with high\r\nvolume, I bitterly resent it,\" he says. \"When the Met Opera gives a\r\nconcert in Central Park the same night that the Schaefer Beer Festival\r\ngives one of their concerts, they're crushed like the runt beneath the belly\r\nof a great fat sow.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a desire for more space and lower rent drove Rorem from\r\nGreenwich Village to the West Side 10 years ago, he feared that he was\r\nmoving to \"a big, nonartistic, bourgeois ghetto.\" He soon changed his\r\nmind. In _An Absolute Gift_ he makes the statement: \"From 116th Street\r\nto 56th Street, the West Side contains more first-rate artists, both\r\nperformers and creators, than any concentrated neighborhood since Paris\r\nin the 1920s.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Rorem's favorite Westside businesses is Patelson's Half Price\r\nMusic Shop at 160 W. 56th Street, right across from the stage door of\r\nCarnegie Hall. \"It's the best music shop in America,\" he testifies. \"They\r\nhave everything or they can get it for you.\"\r\n\r\nAll of Rorem's books carry a fair amount of philosophy. But the only\r\nprinciple that the artist claims to have stuck by during the entire course of\r\nhis life is: \"I've never sold out. I've never done what I didn't want to do.\r\n... I've never been guided by other than my heart. And certainly not by\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JULIUS RUDEL\r\nDirector of the New York City Opera\r\n\r\n4-22-78\r\n\r\nIn 1943, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia made an announcement that the old\r\nMecca Temple on West 55th Street would be converted into the City\r\nCenter of Music and Drama. As a result, a new major company was born\r\n-- the New York City Opera.\r\n\r\nA young Jewish immigrant, Julius Rudel, who had fled Austria with his\r\nfamily not long before, immediately went to City Center in search of a\r\njob. He was hired as a rehearsal pianist, and in the years to come his\r\ntalents blossomed forth in many areas. Working quietly behind the scenes,\r\nhe became the Opera's indispensable Mr. Everything, who not only knew\r\nevery phase of show production, but could be called on to conduct the\r\norchestra and even take the place of a missing cast member on stage.\r\nRudel's versatile musicianship and his personal charm did much to knit the\r\ncompany together.\r\n\r\nIn 1956 the New York City Opera suffered a financially disastrous season\r\nthat led to the resignation of the distinguished Erich Leinsdorf as director\r\nand chief conductor. That was perhaps the lowest point in the company's\r\nhistory. The board of directors pored over dozens of nominations for\r\nLeinsdorf's replacement before they decided on the one person who had\r\nthe confidence of everybody -- Julius Rudel.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two seasons later, he is still firmly in command, and the once\r\nstruggling City Opera has risen to world prominence. Although its $8\r\nmillion annual budget is much smaller than that of the Metropolitan Opera\r\nand the major houses of Europe, Rudel has been able to get many singers\r\nwho are unequaled anywhere, and has staged far more new works by\r\nliving composers than has Lincoln Center's \"other\" opera house.\r\n\r\nApart from its musical significance, the City Opera has become a sort of\r\nliving symbol for the arts in America, flourishing in the face of financial\r\nhardships, and somehow emerging more creative, more artistically\r\nexciting because of those hardships. Why else would people like Beverly\r\nSills and Sherrill Milnes perform at City for a top fee of $1,000, or even\r\nfor free, when they can get $10,000 for a night's work elsewhere?\r\n\r\n\"We build loyalties,\" explains Rudel in his delicate Germanic-British\r\naccent, the morning after conducting a benefit performance of _The Merry\r\nWidow_. \"A lot of our singers go on to other companies, but they come\r\nback. They don't forget us. The New York City Opera has produced more\r\ngreat singers than probably any other company in the world.\"\r\n\r\nIt is early, even for this man who begins his work as soon as he get up\r\nand keeps going till late at night with his multiple roles as music director,\r\nchief conductor, administrator, impresario and goodwill ambassador. Clad\r\nin his colorful dressing gown, his thick silver hair shining, he seems an\r\nentirely different person from the magnetic orchestral leader whose\r\npresence on the podium generally guarantees a full house. At his\r\nexpansive Central Park West apartment, he is low-key and to the point,\r\nand fiercely proud of the City Opera's achievements.\r\n\r\n\"We try to look at every opera we do with fresh eyes, as if it had never\r\nbeen done before. We try to reexamine everything about the opera.\r\nSometimes the tradition attached to a work differs from what the composer\r\nand librettist intended. ... Tradition was defined by a famous conductor\r\nlong ago as 'the last bad performance.' For example, in _Turandot_\r\nthere's a character who had been traditionally [portrayed] as blind. But it\r\nmakes no sense in the story for him to be blind, so we don't play him that\r\nway. We're restoring the classics, not changing them.\"\r\n\r\nHe jumps up to answer the telephone just as his wife Rita enters the room.\r\nA slender, dark-haired woman, she is a doctor of neuropsychology at\r\nColumbia Presbyterian Hospital and a devoted opera fan. \"I'm Mrs. Rudel\r\nin the morning,\" she explains, smiling. She met Julius when they were\r\nboth at music school. Today, while keeping a close friendship with many\r\nof the City Opera's singers, she maintains her own identity to the extent\r\nthat her medical colleagues sometimes tell her, \"I saw you at the opera\r\nlast night,\" without realizing that her husband was the conductor.\r\n\r\nThe Rudels have lived on the West Side ever since they were married 36\r\nyears ago. \"My wife sometimes says we live within mugging distance of\r\nLincoln Center,\" says Rudel, his eyes twinkling with impish amusement.\r\n\"But really, we're confirmed Westsiders. I don't think I ever use any form\r\nof transportation from here to the theatre, and I don't eat out much,\r\nbecause my wife is a marvelous cook. Time being so of the essence, we\r\nprefer to stay at home.\"\r\n\r\nThe City Opera's spring season continues until April 30. Rudel\r\nrecommends three shows in particular: _The Saint of Bleecker Street_,\r\n_The Turn of the Screw_, and _The Marriage of Figaro_, which he is\r\nconducting. \"I envy all the Westsiders who have the opportunity to come\r\nto us,\" he concludes. \"Our seats in the upper reaches of the State Theatre\r\nare the best theatrical bargains in the world.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER DR. LEE SALK\r\nAmerica's foremost child psychologist\r\n\r\n5-5-79\r\n\r\nAt one time, the name Salk was synonymous with one thing only -- the\r\nrevolutionary polio vaccine discovered by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953. In the\r\n1970s, however, another national figure of the same name has emerged\r\n-- Dr. Lee Salk, Jonas' younger brother, who is probably the most highly\r\nrespected and best-known child psychologist in America today.\r\n\r\nThe most successful of his five books, _What Every Child Would Like\r\nHis Parents to Know_ (1972), has been translated into 16 languages, while\r\nhis most recent work, titled simply _Dear Dr. Salk_, was published in\r\nMarch by Harper & Row.\r\n\r\nA soft-spoken, highly energetic man who bears a close physical\r\nresemblance to comedian Phil Silvers, Dr. Salk recently invited me to\r\nshare his thoughts in an interview at his Upper East Side apartment.\r\n\r\n\"What I try to do as a psychologist,\" he said, sitting in a large, circular\r\nchair in his spacious library, \"is to use all the media to present what I\r\nconsider useful psychological information that has been distilled for the\r\nconsumer -- to take the jargon out of it, and the ambiguity, so people can\r\nuse it to deal effectively with their problems. While most people see me\r\nas a child psychologist, I'm really an adult psychologist who has focused\r\non some of the most difficult issues that affect all people. ... In my initial\r\nyears of practice, it became clear to me that most of the problems\r\noriginated in childhood, and I felt that perhaps the front line of mental\r\nhealth is really in those early, critical years.\"\r\n\r\nSince 1972, he has been writing a column titled \"You and Your Family\"\r\nfor _McCall's_ magazine, which has a readership of 16 million.\r\n\r\n\"I frequently deal with family concerns, including problems that have to\r\ndo with older people,\" he explained. \"I choose a different topic each\r\nmonth. Frequently the topic revolves around a number of letters that come\r\nin. The June issue, for example, has an unusually large column because\r\nwe're dealing with sexuality. We get hundreds and hundreds of letters, so\r\nI can't answer them personally, but I do read them all. When I'm giving\r\na speech across the country, I like to use airplane time to catch up on my\r\nmail.\"\r\n\r\nAs a television personality, he appears at least twice a week on NBC's\r\n_News Center 4_. His off-the-cuff manner is no deception: Salk does each\r\nof his broadcasts live, without a script, speaking spontaneously on a\r\ncurrent issue.\r\n\r\nHis latest book, _Dear Dr. Salk_, answers questions ranging from the\r\nspacing of children to problems specific to teenagers. When asked how his\r\napproach compares to that of Ann Landers or Dear Abby, Salk replies: \"I\r\nmust say that they fall far short of what I'm trying to do. These people are\r\nnot professional psychologists. They tend to sensationalize -- to appeal to\r\nthe voyeuristic tendencies people have. I'm not saying they don't help\r\npeople, but they don't always provide people with knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"A good deal of what I say is not direct advice. In answering a question,\r\nI try to provide knowledge about the problem, which the person can use,\r\nto answer his or her own question. I really feel I shouldn't give people a\r\nseries of do's and don'ts\"\r\n\r\nHis knowledge is based on a 25-year career as a professional clinical\r\npsychologist. Following his graduation from the doctoral program at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan, Salk spent three years teaching at McGill\r\nUniversity in Montreal, then returned to Manhattan, where he grew up.\r\nHe still maintains a private practice, and is on the staff at Cornell\r\nUniversity Medical School, the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic and the\r\nLenox Hill Hospital.\r\n\r\nDr. Salk won the custody of his two children, Pia and Eric, in 1975 after\r\na precedent-setting divorce trial in which it was ruled that he was \"the\r\nparent that can best nurture their complex needs and social development.\"\r\n\r\nA problem of many parents, he said, is not that they spend too little time\r\nwith their children, but that \"it's basically useless time, because they're\r\nnot actively involved with the child.\" Salk himself makes a point of having\r\nbreakfast and dinner with Pia and Eric virtually every day, and includes\r\nthem in his social life whenever possible. \"Their friends are frequently my\r\ndinner guests.\" Each summer he spends three months with them at an\r\nisland retreat in Maine, while commuting to New York for his\r\nprofessional commitments. Dr. Salk enjoys cooking, and also likes to go\r\nto restaurants.\r\n\r\nDr. Salk's newest project is a 13-part series for public television, to be\r\naired starting September 29. He will appear each week with three children\r\nto discuss such topics as love and attachment, divorce, and \"making a\r\nfamily work.\" The programs, he said, \"are geared to family viewing time,\r\nso children and their parents can watch together.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER FRANCESCO SCAVULLO\r\nPhotographer of the world's most beautiful women\r\n\r\n6-16-79\r\n\r\nAs Richard Stolley, the managing editor of _People_ magazine, is fond of\r\nsaying, every publication on the newsstand is actually two publications.\r\nOne is the inner contents, and the other -- far more important in terms of\r\nsales -- is the front cover. A stunning cover can make the difference of\r\ntens of thousands of dollars in revenue for a national magazine, and that's\r\nwhy _Cosmopolitan_ has engaged the talents of photographer Francesco\r\nScavullo for virtually every one of its covers for the last 11 years.\r\n\r\nHe has done album covers and posters for Paul McCartney, Barbra\r\nStreisand, Donna Summer, Judy Collins and many others. Among the\r\npublications that rely on his most often for covers are _Vogue_,\r\n_Playboy_, _Glamour_, _Harper's Bazaar_, _Redbook_, _Ladies Home\r\nJournal_, _People_ and the magazine that started it all -- _Seventeen_ --\r\nwhich ran its first Scavullo cover in 1948, when he was still a teenager\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe never had any formal training in photography, but got plenty of\r\npractice during his Manhattan boyhood when he began taking pictures of\r\nhis sisters and their girlfriends. Francesco delighted in applying makeup\r\nto their faces, running his hands through their hair, and dressing them in\r\nsexy gowns. He quickly made two discoveries -- first, that there's no such\r\nthing as an ugly woman, and second, that the photographer and his subject\r\nmust be personally compatible. Although he charges approximately $3,000\r\nfor unsolicited private portraits, Scavullo won't photograph anyone with\r\nwhom he has bad rapport -- and that includes all people who don't take\r\ncare of themselves physically or abuse themselves with drugs.\r\n\r\nA small, lithe man of 50 who walks with the gracefulness of a dancer and\r\nlooks considerably younger than his years, Scavullo recently agreed to an\r\ninterview at the town house on East 63rd Street that serves as both his\r\nstudio and his home. Dressed in blue jeans, an open-neck white shirt, and\r\nWestern boots, the chatty, unpretentious photographer sat back on the\r\ncouch with his arms behind his head and a mischievous smile planted on\r\nhis face. Asked about the large pills he popped into his mouth from time\r\nto time, Scavullo explained that they were vitamins and organic\r\nsupplements.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very health-conscious,\" he said in a gravelly voice with a broad New\r\nYork accent. \"I don't eat meat, and I very seldom have even chicken or\r\nfish. I don't drink tea, or coffee, or alcohol -- except for a little wine. ...\r\nA lot of people stop smoking when they start working for me, because I\r\nhate it -- all this pollution in the air of New York already. I think smoking\r\nis great if you live out in the West, and you sit on top of a mountain like\r\nin the Marlboro commercials.\"\r\n\r\nAs we were talking in his spacious living room, decorated with Scavullo's\r\nown paintings, a member of his staff came from the studio below and\r\nsaid, in reference to a woman who was being made up for a shooting\r\nsession, \"She's still not ready, Francesco.\" Scavullo sighed.\r\n\r\n\"A seating with a man takes 20 minutes,\" he remarked, \"and with a\r\nwoman it takes the whole afternoon. Makeup,\" he added, \"is used more\r\nintensely in photography than it is in the street. I think women look best\r\nwithout any type of makeup in the daytime. Sunlight has a very bad effect\r\non it. Some of the ladies going by on the street look like they're holding\r\na mask a fraction of an inch away from their face.\"\r\n\r\nHe has never developed the habit of stopping beautiful women on the\r\nsidewalk, but, said a grinning Scavullo, \"if I see someone wildly attractive\r\nwalking by, I get excited. I might turn around and whistle or something.\"\r\n\r\nNumber one on his list of the world's most beautiful women is 14-year\r\nold Brooke Shields, who also lives on the Upper East Side. She is one of\r\nthe 59 models, actresses, and other celebrities featured in his first book,\r\n_Scavullo On Beauty_ (1976), which came out in paperback last month\r\nfrom Vintage Press. The volume is filled with life-size shots of women's\r\nfaces, many of them showing the difference before and after the Scavullo\r\ntreatment. It is accompanied by frank interviews dealing with clothing,\r\ndiet, exercise, makeup, and related subjects. _Scavullo On Men_, his\r\nsecond book, was published in 1977. And he has two more in the works\r\n-- a picture book on baseball, with text by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of\r\nthe _New York Times_, and a retrospective volume covering his\r\nphotographs from 1949 to 1980. Both will be out next year.\r\n\r\nA resident of the Upper East Side since 1950, he likes to dance until dawn\r\nat Studio 54 \"whenever I don't have to get up too early the next day.\"\r\nAsked about his favorite local restaurants, he said he rarely goes to any,\r\nbut that his entire staff orders lunch almost every day from Greener\r\nPastures, a natural foods restaurant on East 60th Street.\r\n\r\nBeauty, he believes, \"is an advantage to everything -- man, woman, child,\r\nflower, state. I mean, everything. Beauty is the most fabulous thing in the\r\nworld. I hate ugliness.\" His advice to amateur photographers: \"Get a\r\nPolaroid. It is a very flattering camera to use, because it washes\r\neverything out.\" He couldn't resist adding: \"If you can't be photographed\r\nby Scavullo, have your picture taken with a Polaroid.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER ROGER SESSIONS\r\nComposer of the future\r\n\r\n2-10-79\r\n\r\nThe story of Western music, from the baroque era to the present day, has\r\nbeen written largely by men whose contributions to their art were\r\nunderappreciated during their own lifetimes. Serious music has a tendency\r\nto be ahead of its time, and must wait for the public taste to catch up\r\nbefore it can be accepted.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case with Roger Sessions. For at least 50 years he has been\r\nconsidered by the American academic establishment to be one of the most\r\ngifted and original composers of his generation. But his work has started\r\nto gain wide recognition with the general public only since the early\r\n1960s. Today, at 82, he is comfortable in his role as the elder statesman\r\nof American concert music. Although relatively few of his works have\r\nbeen recorded -- they place extraordinary demands on both performer and\r\nlistener -- Sessions continues to write music with practically unabated\r\nenergy. His most significant official honor came in 1974, when the\r\nPulitzer Prize Committee issued a special citation naming him \"one of the\r\nmost musical composers of the century.\"\r\n\r\nSince his early 20s, Session has led a dual career as a composer and a\r\nteacher of music theory. A former professor at both the University of\r\nCalifornia, Berkeley, and Princeton University, he has published several\r\nbooks on his musical ideas, and now teaches two days a week at the\r\nJuilliard School at Lincoln Center. When I heard that his piano sonatas\r\nwere going to be performed soon on West 57th Street, I called him to\r\nrequest an interview, and he promptly concurred. We met for lunch at La\r\nCrepe on Broadway, and over the meal Sessions revealed himself to be a\r\nman of wit, humility, and charm.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his piano sonatas, which will be performed at Carnegie\r\nRecital Hall in February, March and April, Sessions commented in his\r\nslow, precise manner of speech that \"the first one was composed in 1930,\r\nthe second one was composed in '46, and the third one was composed in\r\n'65. One sonata will be performed on each program. ... I have heard the\r\nyoung lady play one of them. She's going to come and play for me today.\r\nI'm helping her to prepare them. Because they're difficult and they take\r\na lot of practice. Her name is Miss Rebecca la Becque. I just laid eyes on\r\nher for the first time last week.\"\r\n\r\nNearly half of his works have been composed in the last 20 years; some\r\nare quite melodic; others are so atonal and eery that to some people they\r\nsuggest the rhythm of the universe itself, or music from the stars. One\r\nremarkable aspect of his compositions is that no two are even vaguely\r\nalike; another is that they come in so many different instrumental\r\ncombinations. Besides his piano works, he has composed for violin,\r\norgan, cello, chorus and solo voice. In addition, there are his string\r\nquartets, his rhapsodies, his nine symphonies, and _Montezuma_, one of\r\nthe most distinguished operas ever written by an American.\r\n\r\nWhy write in so many forms? \"You might say I'm paid to,\" he explained,\r\nordering a second espresso and lighting his pipe. \"Generally when I write\r\na big work, it's for a specific purpose.\" His eighth symphony, for\r\nexample, was written for the New York Philharmonic to commemorate the\r\norchestra's 125th anniversary.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Sessions whether he was concerned that most of his works\r\nare not available on albums, he said calmly, \"I never have tried to get my\r\nworks recorded or performed. I decided years ago that people would have\r\nto come to me; I wasn't coming to them. Things move a little more slowly\r\nthat way, but one knows that everything one gets is perfectly genuine. ...\r\nWhen I wrote my first symphony, Otto Klemperer said he wouldn't dare\r\nto conduct it. So I conducted it myself. It would be easy nowadays. Even\r\nthe Princeton student orchestra played it a few years ago and didn't do too\r\nbadly. Orchestra players get used to the idiom and people get used to\r\nlistening. ... The only thing is,\" he added with a chuckle, \"I keep getting\r\nahead in that respect.\"\r\n\r\nHe was born in Brooklyn in 1896 and moved to Massachusetts at age 3,\r\nbut Sessions noted that \"I do have some memories of the inside of the\r\nhouse.\" He wrote his first opera at 13 and graduated from Harvard at 18.\r\n>From 1925 until 1933 he lived in Italy and Germany, supported by\r\nscholarships. Shortly after Hitler came to power, he returned to the U.S.,\r\nand not long afterward joined the faculty at Princeton, where he remained\r\nuntil 1946. Then he taught at the University of California at Berkeley for\r\neight years before returning to Princeton, where he remained until his\r\nmandatory retirement in 1965. Since that time he has taught at Juilliard.\r\nHe and his wife Elizabeth have been married for 42 years; they have two\r\nchildren and two grandchildren. Said the composer: \"I learned that I had\r\na grandson just a few hours after I'd gotten the citation from the Pulitzer\r\nPrize Committee, and the grandson was much more exciting -- with all\r\ndue respect.\"\r\n\r\nA resident of Princeton, New Jersey except for the one night each week\r\nthat he spends on the West Side, Sessions is now eagerly awaiting the\r\nperformance of his ninth symphony. It was completed in October and will\r\nbe premiered in Syracuse shortly.\r\n\r\nIn his Princeton study he is kept constantly busy composing new works,\r\nwriting letters and correcting proofs. \"I don't have any hobbies,\" he\r\nremarked at the end of the interview. \"I like good books, but I don't get\r\nmuch time to read them. If I go a few days without composing, I start to\r\nfeel a little bit depressed.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER DICK SHAWN\r\nVeteran comic talks about _Love at First Bite_\r\n\r\n5-19-79\r\n\r\nDick Shawn's name keeps cropping up these days. The last time he made\r\na big splash in New York was two years ago, when his one-man show,\r\n_Dick Shawn is the Second Greatest Entertainer in the Whole Wide\r\nWorld_, played at the Promenade Theatre for 14 weeks. But last fall, he\r\ngained millions of new fans with his sparkling appearances on the ill-fated\r\nnetwork variety show starring Mary Tyler Moore, which folded after the\r\nthird week. A commonly heard criticism of the show was: less Mary and\r\nmore Shawn.\r\n\r\nIn George Hamilton's recently released film, _Love At First Bite_, Shawn\r\nplays the role of Lieutenant Ferguson, who teams up with a psychiatrist\r\nin order to make war on Dracula. Also he recently played the lead in the\r\nnew Russell Baker/Cy Coleman musical, _Home Again_. But these are\r\nonly a few of the highlights of Shawn's career, as I discover in an\r\ninterview with the 51-year-old comedian at his plush Upper East Side\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nThe word \"comedian,\" he quickly points out, is not quite accurate. \"I\r\nthink of myself as a comedy character,\" he explains, relaxing on his couch\r\nwith a plate of croissants and bacon that his pretty assistant has just\r\nbrought him. \"In _Home Again_, I played seven characters. ... They ran\r\nout of money; it just closed out of town. It needs another four or five\r\nweeks of work. They plan to bring it back around September.\"\r\n\r\nWith his middle-age paunch and full head of tousled grey hair that\r\nresembles a bird's nest, Shawn has a definite comedic look about him, but\r\nhe seldom smiles and never laughs during our long conversation. Still, his\r\nanswers are both entertaining and revealing.\r\n\r\nOn Mary Tyler Moore's variety show: \"That was a total mistake. They\r\ndidn't know what they were doing there. I thought she was going to get\r\nthe best writers and the best producers. But it was totally inadequate. I\r\nknew from the very first day that it wasn't going to work. ... The whole\r\nconcept was wrong. Variety isn't Mary's forte. You have to get yourself\r\nrolling around on the ground a little bit. She's such a nice, sweet girl that\r\nshe doesn't come off as a clown.\"\r\n\r\nThe basis of all humor, believes Shawn, \"is hostility. But it has to be\r\nsweet hostility. ... I think people become comedians because they poke\r\nfun at pretentiousness. They usually come from meager backgrounds, and\r\nthen they can look up and see the pomposity and the hypocrisy of many\r\nhuman beings. That's why there are no rich comics. A great many of\r\nthem are Jewish or black -- because as a kid they were told they were part\r\nof a minority group. They learned to have a sense of humor about\r\nthemselves: they had to, in order to survive. Humor is their way of\r\ngetting even with mankind.\"\r\n\r\nShawn's own background lends credence to his theory. Born Richard\r\nSchulefand in the steel town of Lackawanna, New York, he grew up in\r\na family that was hard-hit by the Depression. While serving with the\r\nArmy following World War II, he ended up in an entertainment troupe.\r\n\"I was delighted,\" he recalls, \"and when I got out, I decided to pursue it.\"\r\nIn the early 1950s, he secured his first professional engagement as a\r\nstand-up comic in Bayonne, New Jersey, and was paid $25 a night. Since\r\nthen, he has never been out of work, and has constantly used only his own\r\nmaterial for his solo act -- songs as well as sketches.\r\n\r\n\"I don't really do jokes,\" he explains. \"I do situation characters. Although\r\nthe thrust of my humor is serious, I have always taken chances. In my\r\nclub act, for example, I always ended up pretending to die on stage, rather\r\nthan taking bows. Two guys would come with a stretcher and carry me\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nAmong his more memorable performances over the years: the successor\r\nto Zero Mostel in Broadway's _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to\r\nthe Forum_, the freakishly funny beach bum in the Stanley Kramer film\r\n_It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World_, and a cavorting Adolph Hitler in\r\nMel Brooks' zany 1968 movie, _The Producers_.\r\n\r\nStill, no project has gained him as much personal satisfaction as _The\r\nSecond Greatest Entertainer in the Whole Wide World_. After the New\r\nYork run, the show played to enthusiastic audiences in San Francisco and\r\nLos Angeles, and earned Shawn awards for both Best Performer and Best\r\nPlaywright of the Year.\r\n\r\nAn Eastsider for the past seven years, he names Elaine's as his favorite\r\nlocal restaurant because \"the food is good, and there's a simplicity about\r\nthe place the attracts me.\"\r\n\r\nShawn describes himself as \"disciplined, but not as disciplined as I should\r\nbe. Because my work is loose, I'm always adding or changing. Nothing\r\never stays the same. But comedy is a very rewarding profession. It's nice\r\nto know that something that pops into your head can cause a reaction from\r\ntotal strangers who are paying you money to be entertained. I think that's\r\nthe ultimate.\"\r\n\r\nProbably best-known for _The Prod\r\nucers_.\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER GEORGE SHEARING\r\nFamed jazz pianist returns to New York\r\n\r\n2-3-79\r\n\r\nThe scene was a Boston nightclub in the early 1950s. George Shearing and\r\nhis quintet were scheduled to play the second set of the evening; the\r\nopening act was a piano/bass/drums trio. But as soon as the first group's\r\npianist hit the keys, a groan went up from the audience. It was a bad box,\r\nas they said in those days. The management's promise of a tuning had not\r\nbeen kept.\r\n\r\nThe trio retired in defeat 15 minutes later, and the audience called for\r\nShearing. When the blind pianist was led on stage, he announced, to\r\neveryone's astonishment, that he would open with a solo. But when he sat\r\ndown at the instruments, a small miracle took place. The notes rang out\r\nwith the clarity of crystal; Shearing's acute ear had told him which keys\r\nto avoid, and the precise amount of pressure to apply to the others so that\r\nthe poor tuning would be camouflaged. Those who were present to\r\nwitness Shearing's uncanny musicianship may never forget the experience.\r\nBut attending any of his performances is hardly less forgettable.\r\n\r\nHe's now playing each Tuesday through Saturday evening at the Cafe\r\nCarlyle, 76th Street and Madison Avenue, and will remain there until\r\nMarch 3rd. His famous quintet is no more -- the group was disbanded in\r\n1978 after 29 years -- but Shearing, accompanied only by bass player\r\nBrian Torff, proves himself a master showman as he performs his unique\r\nbrand of jazz, tells funny stories between numbers, and sings in his lilting,\r\nplayful manner.\r\n\r\n\"I'm on the road about 10 months a year,\" he told the Carlyle crowd the\r\nprevious night, when I went there to catch his show. \"And one thing I\r\ncannot tolerate is the mediocrity of hotels and motels in this country.\r\nOnce, on my second morning in a hotel, I called up the room service and\r\nsaid, 'Could you please bring me some breakfast? I'd like two eggs, one\r\nof them poached and the other scrambled; two pieces of toast, one barely\r\nwarm and the other burned almost to a crisp; and a pot of half coffee and\r\nhalf tea.' The person on the other end said, 'I'm sorry sir, I don't think\r\nwe can fill that order.' I said, 'Why not? That's what you brought me\r\nyesterday.'\"\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon I paid Shearing a visit at his new Eastside apartment,\r\nwhere he recently moved from San Francisco. An extremely amiable,\r\nwitty, and knowledgeable man who speaks with a soft British accent, he\r\nguided me around the large, tastefully furnished apartment with great\r\nease, showing me his braille-marked tape collection, his audio calculator\r\nand his braille library. He described everything, from the drapes to the\r\nfurniture, as if he had perfect vision. Blind since birth, he is an expert\r\nbridge player and a fine cook.\r\n\r\n\"I've just started to take cooking lessons,\" said Shearing, stretched out n\r\nthe sofa with a smile hovering constantly on his face. \"My wife and I are\r\ntaking the same course. It's at the Jewish Guild for the Blind. Naturally\r\nit's better for me to take lessons from someone who knows the\r\nidiosyncracies of cooking without looking. ... I'm very interested in taste.\r\nIf I were to cook some peas, for example, I would be inclined to line the\r\nsaucepan with lettuce and add a little sugar and mint.\"\r\n\r\nBorn 59 years ago in London, the ninth child of a coalman, he began\r\nplucking out radio tunes on the piano at the age of 6, and by his early 20s\r\nwas considered one of England's finest jazz pianists. He moved to the\r\nU.S. in 1947, and two years later became an overnight sensation when his\r\nnewly formed quintet recorded \"September in the Rain,\" which sold\r\n900,000 copies. To date, Shearing has recorded more than 50 albums.\r\nWhen he finally broke up his quintet, it was to allow himself more\r\nmusical freedom. His playing is a combination of jazz, classical and pop\r\nthat calls for much improvisation.\r\n\r\nHis most famous original composition, \"Lullaby of Birdland,\" came to\r\nhim \"when I was sitting in my dining room in New Jersey, eating a steak.\r\nIt took me only 10 minutes to write it. I went back to that butcher several\r\ntimes afterwards, but I never got the same steak.\"\r\n\r\nA popular television personality, Shearing has appeared on all the major\r\nTV talk shows. In the past 15 years or so, he has also become a frequent\r\nperformer with symphony orchestras, usually playing a piano concerto in\r\nthe first half of the program and a jazz piece in the second half. Lionized\r\nin England, he returned to London last December and played a sellout\r\nconcert at the 6500-seat Royal Albert Hall.\r\n\r\nNew York is where his American career began, and he decided to move\r\nback after spending 16 years on the West Coast, primarily because New\r\nYork is far more centrally located for his extensive travelling. He chose\r\nthe Upper East Side because \"it would be difficult to realize we're in the\r\nheart of Manhattan, it's so quiet here.\" No sooner did he speak the words\r\nthan, as if on cue, a baby in a downstairs apartment began to cry loudly.\r\n\"Does somebody have a plastic bag?\" he deadpanned.\r\n\r\nOne of Shearing's main interests -- besides music, bridge and cooking --\r\nis business law. He once took a course on the subject \"because I wanted\r\nto know what the other guy's rights are. If I know what his rights are, I\r\nknow what mine are.\" Speaking of his many disappointments in hotels and\r\nmotels, he said, \"Misrepresentation and false advertising can be beaten at\r\nany time anyone wants to fight it. I have never lost a battle on this score\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nHe might have added, had modesty not prevented it, that he has also lost\r\nno battles in the game of life.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER REID SHELTON\r\nThe big-hearted billionaire of _Annie_\r\n\r\n12-22-79\r\n\r\n_Annie_, the touching musical about seven little orphan girls in New York\r\nCity at Christmastime during the Great Depression, has been the\r\nBroadway show against which all others must be compared ever since it\r\nopened in April, 1977.\r\n\r\nThat year it won seven Tony Awards. Later the movie rights were sold\r\nfor a record $9.5 million. There are now companies performing the\r\nmusical in Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, England, South Africa,\r\nAustralia, Japan and Scandinavia. The album has gone gold. Still a sellout\r\nvirtually every night at the Alvin Theatre, its tickets are the hardest to\r\nobtain of any show in town.\r\n\r\nTwo of the three leading characters -- those of Annie and the cruel, gin\r\nsodden orphanage director Miss Hannigan -- have been twice replaced by\r\nnew performers. But Oliver \"Daddy\" Warbucks, the bald-headed\r\nbillionaire with a heart as big as his bank account, has been played since\r\nthe beginning by Reid Shelton, a Westside actor long known for his\r\nportrayal of powerful figures on stage -- cardinals and kings, statesmen\r\nand presidents.\r\n\r\nOn December 23rd, just a few days short of its 1,200th performance, Reid\r\nwill finally leave the New York company to star in _Annie_ on the West\r\nCoast. He has no plans, at this point, of giving up the role that earned him\r\na Tony nomination for Best Actor.\r\n\r\n\"I've had two three-week vacations and I've missed four performances in\r\nalmost three years,\" says Reid in his dressing room on a recent afternoon.\r\nEasing his tall, bulky frame onto a sofa, he immediately reveals a\r\npersonality that is warm, good-humored and eager to please. His broad,\r\nall-American features give distinction to his gleaming, newly shaved head.\r\nReid shaves twice a day with an electric razor.\r\n\r\n\"My understudy plays Roosevelt in the show, and of course for the four\r\nperformances that he's had to go on for me, he didn't shave his head,\"\r\nlaughs the 55-year-old actor. \"I've gotten the most angry letters from\r\npeople saying, 'Well my God, can't you at least have the understudy\r\nshave his head? How dare you do that to us!'\"\r\n\r\nAsked about his qualifications for playing a billionaire, Reid says, \"I don't\r\nknow whether it's my look, personality, or what, but people have always\r\nthought that I've come from money. Actually, my family during the\r\nDepression was very poor.\"\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Salem, Oregon, he began studying voice while a high\r\nschool freshman, doing chores in exchange for lessons. After graduation,\r\nhe was drafted into the First Cavalry Division of the U.S. Army, fought\r\nin the Pacific, then received his master's degree in voice under the G.I.\r\nBill. Arriving in New York City in 1951, he got a job singing at Radio\r\nCity Music Hall. From there he went on to many Broadway musicals, TV\r\nshows, films and recordings. His generous income from _Annie_ enabled\r\nhim, last year, to purchase the Westside apartment building in the Theater\r\nDistrict where he's been living since 1956. \"It's a rent-controlled building\r\nwith 20 apartment units. This last year I lost four thousand dollars on it\r\nbecause of oil and everything, but I have never regretted buying it.\"\r\n\r\nSome behind-the-scene stories are as interesting as the show itself. Yul\r\nBrynner, for example, has refused to be photographed with Shelton:\r\n\"Maybe he's afraid if the strobes hit our glistening heads simultaneously\r\nthere will be no picture.\" Sandy, the dog, was discovered in an animal\r\nshelter just one day before he was due to be put to sleep. \"It's that bored,\r\nI-don't-care quality that that dog has,\" says Reid, \"that's so endearing to\r\nthe audience. He lives with his trainer and owner, Bill Berloni, a\r\nmarvelous young chap who found a whole new career for himself through\r\nthe dog.\" And when the subject of orphanages comes up, Reid tells of a\r\nplace called the Jennie Clarkson Home in Valhalla, New York, which he\r\nvisited not long ago.\r\n\r\n\"It's not exactly an orphanage, but a temporary home for girls whose\r\nfamilies can't provide for them. They have about 40 girls who stay in\r\ncottages with cottage parents, and they go to school there. The agency\r\nworks with the family by trying to find the father a job or whatever, so\r\nthe girls can finally return home. ... I was so impressed with the work\r\nthey're doing. I'm trying to raise money for it.\"\r\n\r\nHe recalls visiting the White House to do a shortened version of _Annie_\r\nfor the Carters. \"We got back at 3 in the morning, totally exhausted, but\r\nthe whole day was made worthwhile when Mrs. Carter sought me out and\r\nsaid, 'You know, I must tell you how much I appreciate your taking your\r\nday off to come down here and do this for us. It must be a real chore, and\r\nI do appreciate it.' It was just a wonderful, wonderful personal thing that\r\nshe didn't have to do. It's something I will always treasure.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, says Reid, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood came\r\nbackstage after a show. \"Bobby just kept crying, and Natalie finally said,\r\n'For God's sake, Bob, stop it.' But he couldn't. Even now, I'm terribly\r\nthrilled when people come back and say, 'You made me cry.' I'm proud\r\nof that. If I can touch some response in people, and maybe open up\r\nsomething that they didn't even know they felt, that's a tremendous plus\r\nin being an actor.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER BOBBY SHORT\r\nMr. New York to perform in Newport Jazz Festival\r\n\r\n6-23-79\r\n\r\nTo some, he is New York City personified -- Bobby Short, the eternally\r\nyouthful singer and pianist who has been packing in audiences at the Cafe\r\nCarlyle five nights a week for the past 11 years. Regarded as the foremost\r\nliving interpreter of Cole Porter, Short has recorded eight albums,\r\npublished his autobiography, lectured on American music at Harvard and\r\nperformed at the White House. His many television commercials have\r\ngained him national recognition in the last year or so, but he is proudest\r\nof the one he did for the \"I Love A Clean New York\" campaign, showing\r\nhim sweeping the sidewalk with his customary savoir-faire.\r\n\r\nSix months out of the year, he holds court at the Carlyle, a supper club\r\nat Lexington Avenue and 76th Street, where eager fans plunk down $10\r\nfor each one-hour set. Backed up by a bass player and a percussionist, the\r\nsmooth, sophisticated Short sits behind the keyboard in a tuxedo,\r\nperforming popular songs from the early 20th century to the present day.\r\nEvery word and every note comes out a finely polished jewel, leaving the\r\naudience with the impression that they have never heard the song before.\r\n\r\nFour months out of the year, Short takes to the road, giving concerts from\r\nLos Angeles to Paris, often as soloist with major orchestras. The hottest\r\nand coldest months of the year -- January and August -- he sets aside for\r\nvacation, sometimes taking a house in the south of France, since he is\r\nwell versed in the French language and is constantly seeking to expand his\r\nknowledge of gourmet cooking.\r\n\r\nWhile in New York, he occupies a luxurious nine-room Westside\r\napartment with 18-foot ceilings that formerly belonged to Leonard\r\nBernstein. Here, in a vast living room with a complete wall of mirror, a\r\nfireplace and a virtual forest of green plants, I thank Short for the glass\r\nof wine that he offers me from a crystal decanter, and I begin our\r\ninterview by asking about the show he's co-producing for the Newport\r\nJazz Festival. Titled A _Salute to Black Broadway, 1900-1945_, it will\r\ntake place in Avery Fisher Hall at 8 p.m. on June 24, and is one of the\r\nhighlights of the 26th annual jazz festival, which runs from June 22 to\r\nJuly 1.\r\n\r\n\"It's the chance to try my wings at something new,\" says the jovial\r\nmusician, in a somewhat gravelly, high-pitched voice marked by flawless\r\ndiction. \"Also, it's a chance to inform. I suppose I'm a frustrated\r\nprofessor of sorts. This show is a way of stating that, in fact, there were\r\nblacks involved in productions on Broadway as far back as 1900 --\r\nperhaps even further back. Many were performers who wrote their own\r\nmaterial. Others were composers and lyricists whose writing was not\r\nconfined to black performers. Some of them wrote for the Ziegfeld\r\nFollies.\"\r\n\r\nAs co-producer with Robert Kimball, Short has been \"researching material\r\nto find out what's good, what's bad, what's important, and also who's\r\naround today that was in those shows.\" Among the performers to be\r\nfeatured: famed jazz singer Mabel Mercer, a longtime friend of Short's;\r\nAdelaide Hall and Edith Wilson, two of black Broadway's original stars;\r\nNell Carter, the Tony Award-winning star of Fats Waller's _Ain't\r\nMisbehavin'_; Eubie Blake, still an active pianist in his 90s, whose\r\ncurrently running _Eubie!_ is the fourth Broadway show he has written;\r\nspecial guest artist Diahann Carroll; and the Dick Hyman Orchestra. Of\r\ncourse Bobby Short will be on stage too; he'll do at least five songs out\r\nof his repertoire of 1,000-plus.\r\n\r\nSlender, debonair, and looking more like 40 than his actual 54 years,\r\nShort has been playing and singing in public ever since he made his debut\r\nat the age of 9 while growing up in Danville, Illinois. From the age of 12\r\nto 14 he was a child star on the vaudeville and nightclub circuit. Then he\r\nreturned to Danville, completed high school at 17, and began his second\r\ncareer. Producer/songwriter Anna Sosenko got him a job at the Blue\r\nAngel in Manhattan; after that he worked in California and France before\r\nsettling permanently in New York in 1956.\r\n\r\nA perennial name on the best-dressed list, Short says that \"today I've got\r\na tailor in New York, a tailor in London, and I buy a lot of things in\r\nbetween. But I've grown more sensible over the years. I no longer buy all\r\nI can get my hands on.\"\r\n\r\nHis secret for staying young? \"Be sensible. If you use the most intimate\r\nparts of your body to make a living -- like your throat -- you can't abuse\r\nit. You can't drink too much, and you simply cannot smoke.\" Extremely\r\nknowledgeable about restaurants, he lists the Russian Tea Room and\r\nPearl's Chinese Restaurant as his favorites.\r\n\r\nHis \"Charlie\" commercial for a cologne by Revlon has made Short one of\r\nthe most recognized figures on the streets of New York, yet he doesn't\r\nmind being approached by strangers. \"It's part of what I do for a living,\"\r\nhe muses with a smile. \"It never stops. You have to learn to live with it\r\nor get out of show business. Fortunately, I'm a very social person and I\r\nlike people. I understand the need to say hello to someone on the street --\r\nso I can't knock somebody for speaking to me.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER BEVERLY SILLS\r\nOpera superstar\r\n\r\n9-30-78\r\n\r\nProbably no opera singer since Caruso has made so great an impact on the\r\nAmerican public as Beverly Sills. Even today, the mention of her name\r\ncan automatically sell out a concert hall anywhere in the U.S. She has\r\nbecome bigger than her art, for while a few younger singers can reach the\r\nnotes more easily, Sills generates a certain intense excitement into all her\r\nroles that makes every show she appears in not just an opera, but an\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nHer star vehicle this fall is an early 19th-century opera, _Il Turco In\r\nItalia_ (The Turk in Italy), written by Gioacchino Rossini prior to his\r\nmasterpiece, _The Barber of Seville_.\r\n\r\n_Il Turco_, presented by the New York City Opera for eight performances\r\nin September through November, is a subtle comedy about a flirtatious,\r\nSophia Loren-type character (Sills) with a jealous husband. The audience\r\nwill miss none of the Italian humor because this production of _Il Turco_\r\nis in English.\r\n\r\n\"I love to do English translations,\" said Miss Sills last week in a telephone\r\ninterview. \"I believe the whole art of opera is based on communication.\r\nI don't see how people can appreciate a comedy in a language that four\r\nfifths of the audience doesn't understand. There's only snobbery about\r\nforeign languages in this country -- not in Europe. In America, an opera\r\nis like a museum piece. But I think the great classics like _Boheme_ and\r\n_Traviata_ don't need to be translated because everyone knows what\r\nthey're about.\"\r\n\r\nShe performs regularly with the New York City Opera even though the\r\nState Theatre-based company is able to pay only a tiny fraction of what\r\nsingers receive at other great opera houses around the world. \"I made my\r\ncareer with them,\" she explained. \"I sing there because of loyalty, and\r\nbecause I love to.\" She has already made plans to retire from singing in\r\n1980 and to become codirector of the New York City Opera with Julius\r\nRudel, the present director.\r\n\r\nRight now she is busy studying three other roles. On December 7 she will\r\nheadline the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Donizetti's _Don\r\nPasquale_, which will run until January 20. In March she will star in a\r\nworld premiere for the New York City Opera, _Miss Haversham's Fire_,\r\nbased on the Charles Dickens novel _Great Expectations_. In June she\r\nwill go to San Diego to perform in yet another world-premiere opera,\r\n_Juana La Loca_ by Gian Carlo Menotti.\r\n\r\nLast season, Beverly hosted a popular television program called\r\n_Lifestyles_. This year, she said, \"I'm doing something much bigger, as\r\na result of that show's success. Unfortunately, I can't tell you what it is,\r\nbecause CBS will be making an announcement in mid-October.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Sills said she has no plans for another book. Her first, the self\r\nportrait _Bubbles_, has sold 130,000 copies in hardcover and many times\r\nthat figure in paperback since it came out a year ago. \"Bubbles\" was her\r\nchildhood nickname. She was born Belle Silverman in Brooklyn a few\r\nmonths before the stock market crash of 1929. At 3 she did her first radio\r\nbroadcast; at 7 she was the star of a regular weekly radio show. In her\r\nearly teens she joined a touring musical company and spent the next 10\r\nyears on the road. Then she was accepted by the New York City Opera.\r\n\r\nIn her first few seasons with the fledgling company, she showed few signs\r\nof the fame that was to come. Meanwhile, she and her husband,\r\nnewspaper publisher Peter Greenough, had become the happy parents of\r\ntwo, a girl named Meredith (Muffy) and a boy, Peter Junior.\r\n\r\nThen the heartbreak struck. When Muffy was 2, it was discovered that she\r\nsuffered from a serious hearing impairment. A few months later, the\r\ncouple learned that their son was severely mentally retarded.\r\n\r\nFor the next year and a half, Beverly abandoned her singing career and\r\nspent all her time at home. When she returned to the New York City\r\nOpera, people noticed a distinct change. Somehow she seemed to have\r\nacquired a new dramatic power. In such roles as Cleopatra in Handel's\r\n_Julius Caesar_ she dazzled both critics and public, and has done so ever\r\nsince. In 1969, when she made her debut at La Scala in Milan -- Europe's\r\nforemost opera house -- the Italian press labeled her \"La Fenomena.\"\r\n\r\nBecause of a long-standing disagreement with Rudolph Bing, the managing\r\ndirector of the Metropolitan Opera, it was not until 1975, after Bing's\r\nretirement, that she made her debut at the Met. The occasion caused the\r\nlargest advance ticket sale in the company's history.\r\n\r\nFor the pat eight years, Sills and her family have lived on Central Park\r\nWest. \"I just feel that we get all the sunshine here,\" she said. Muffy has\r\njust started her freshman year at college in upstate New York and plans\r\nto become a veterinarian.

I tried out for the New York City Opera nine times\r\nbefore they took me. And auditions themselves are valuable: they give you\r\nthe experience of a performance.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nGEORGE SINGER\r\n46 years a doorman on the West Side\r\n\r\n12-20-77\r\n\r\nIt's a wet, stormy night on the West Side; rain is pelting down without\r\nmercy, and the wind is whipping along the edge of the park like a tornado\r\nin a canyon. A taxi pulls up in front of the Century Building at 25 Central\r\nPark West, and at the same moment a man in uniform emerges from the\r\nbuilding holding an umbrella to escort the woman passenger to safety.\r\nAnyone watching the scene would hardly guess that the doorman is 75\r\nyears old. But his age is not the only remarkable thing about George\r\nSinger.\r\n\r\nDuring his 46 years at the Century -- longer than any other employee or\r\ntenant -- George has seen the entire history of the city reflected in the\r\npeople who have come and gone through the entrance. He has gotten to\r\nknow world-famous celebrities who have lived in the building, and has\r\nmet countless others who came to visit -- from prizefighters to presidents.\r\nHe has watched the enormous changes of fashion, custom and law. And\r\nfrom the start of the Great Depression to the beginning of the Koch\r\nadministration, George has remained the same calm, good-natured\r\nobserver, seeing all but criticizing no one.\r\n\r\n\"I've been here since this was a hole in the ground,\" he says matter-of\r\nfactly, puffing on a cigar in the outer lobby of the building, keeping one\r\neye on the door. \"It all started in 1930, when they tore down the old\r\nCentury Theatre to put up a luxury apartment building. I got a job as a\r\nplumber's helper, lugging big pipes across the ground. After it was\r\nfinished in 1931, I went to the superintendent and told him I helped build\r\nthe Century and asked for a job. I simply had to get work, because it was\r\nduring the Depression and I had my wife and two kids. ... I started as an\r\nelevator man and I worked up to the front door within a year.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1929 George had been earning $125 a week in a hat factory; in 1931\r\nhis wages were $75 a month for a 72-hour work week. \"Our suits had to\r\nbe pressed, our hair combed, shoes shined. We had to wear a white bow\r\ntie, white gloves. ... If you looked cross-eyed at a tenant and he reported\r\nyou to the office you were fired in those days.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the 1930s, only about one-fourth of the apartments were rented.\r\nAmong the residents was a Mrs. Gershwin; her sons George, Ira and\r\nArthur made frequent visits. By the early 1940s the Century Building had\r\nbecome one of the most exclusive addresses in New York. Heavyweight\r\nboxing champion Jack Dempsey, Ethel Merman, Nannette Fabray, Mike\r\nTodd and theatre magnate Lee Schubert moved in during those years,\r\nalong with many celebrities whose names are less familiar today -- singer\r\nBelle Baker, sports announcers Ted Husing and Graham McNamee, and\r\nworld champion welterweight boxer Barney Ross.\r\n\r\nGeorge recalls \"sparring around\" with Dempsey in the lobby at night. \"He\r\nhad a great sense of humor. When he came in late and found the elevator\r\nboy asleep he'd give him a hot foot.\" Ethel Merman, he remembers, \"had\r\nthree or four husbands. In between her husbands she used to go out with\r\ndifferent men. She used to smooch with them in the lobby.\r\n\r\n\"In those days we took in Louis Lepke, with his wife and family,\" says\r\nGeorge with a smile. \"He always had three or four bodyguards with him.\r\nWhen he was here, he behaved himself.\" At other times, of course, Lepke\r\nwas not so well behaved. He headed a group known as \"Murder\r\nIncorporated,\" popularized the term \"hit man,\" and was sent to the\r\nelectric chair for his crimes.\r\n\r\nMore recent tenants include Robert Goulet, singer/Playboy playmate Joey\r\nHeatherton, and Ted Sorenson, a former presidential advisor who in the\r\npast year has been visited at the Century by both Jimmy Carter and Walter\r\nMondale. Did George get a chance to shake the president's hand? \"Yes.\r\nWhat's the big deal?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Singer and Estelle, his wife of 53 years, live in Trump Village\r\nnear Coney Island. They have seven grandchildren and one great\r\ngrandchild. George could easily afford to retire -- in fact, he is sometimes\r\njokingly referred to as \"the richest man in the building\" -- but he chooses\r\nto keep working. \"Why not work till 75 or 80 if you're able?\" he says.\r\n\"I think it's good for a person. Mr. Chanin, who owns this building: he's\r\nin his 80s and he goes to work most every day.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge continues to do the night shift as he always has -- \"I'd rather work\r\nnights. There's more money at nights. And you don't have the bosses\r\naround. ... At night people are more in a free spirit.\"\r\n\r\nHow does George explain his continued success and good health? Does he\r\nhave a secret he would like to pass on? \"I smoke two cigars a day,\" he\r\nanswers immediately, with a gleam in his eye. \"That keeps the cold germs\r\naway. I never catch cold. It's the best medicine in the world.\"\r\n\r\nIs George looking forward to Christmas? Aren't all doormen!\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER GREGG SMITH\r\nFounder and conductor of the Gregg Smith Singers\r\n\r\n1-28-78\r\n\r\nWhat might you guess about a man who has composed 60 major choral\r\nworks, toured the world with his singing group, and recorded 50 albums\r\nincluding three Grammy Award winners?\r\n\r\nIf you didn't know anything else about this man, you would probably\r\nguess, first, that he is rich. Then you might imagine that his door is\r\nconstantly bombarded by recording agents trying to enlist his talents. And\r\nthird, you would probably think that his name is a household word.\r\n\r\nBut Westsider Gregg Smith has all of the qualifications listed and none of\r\nthe imagined results. This is because his music happens to be classical --\r\na field in which, he says, \"a record that sells 10,000 copies is considered\r\na good hit.\" Conducting his choral group, the Gregg Smith Singers, who\r\nusually have anywhere from 16 to 32 voices, he performs works spanning\r\nthe last four centuries of the Western classical tradition. Gregg writes\r\nmost of the arrangements himself. Last year his sheet music sales reached\r\n60,000 copies.\r\n\r\nThe Gregg Smith Singers specialize in pieces that have been infrequently\r\nperformed or recorded. But a more lengthy description of their music can\r\nonly tell what it is, not how it sounds. Music speaks for itself better than\r\nany words can describe.\r\n\r\n\"None of the American composers of today are making a living,\" says\r\nGregg, shaking his head. We're sitting in his spacious but unluxurious\r\napartment near Lincoln Center. \"It's a terrible struggle. When people talk\r\nabout ghetto areas, let me tell you, no one is more in a ghetto than the\r\nAmerican classical composer. We have more great composers in this\r\ncountry right now than any other country in the word, and the United\r\nStates supports its composers less than any other country. ... They want\r\nso desperately to perform their music. A composer does a piece and gets\r\na performance in New York, and that may be the last performance it ever\r\ngets.\"\r\n\r\nHe leads me to a room lined with shelves, boxes and cabinets filled with\r\nsheet music, some of it in manuscript. This is where Gregg chooses each\r\nnew selection for his group. He shrugs at the enormity of the task.\r\n\r\n\"There are at least 400 new American compositions here, waiting to be\r\nlooked at. Probably at least 100 of them are of the highest quality. ...\r\nWhen we record this type of material, we don't expect to make a profit,\r\neven with the royalties over the years. Classical records are made because\r\nthe music needs to be heard. It's a second form of publication. We do it\r\nas a means of getting this music out.\"\r\n\r\nThe same economic rule holds true when the Singers do a concert.\r\nBecause of the large size of the group and the vast amount of rehearsal\r\ntime needed to perfect new works or new arrangements, the box office\r\nreceipts don't come close to meeting the expenses. The grants they receive\r\nfrom the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State\r\nCouncil for the Arts are not always sufficient. \"Like every one of the arts,\r\nit's a constant deficit operation. At this point, we're not nearly as strong\r\nin fund-raising as in the other aspects.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the financial pressures, Gregg does manage to provide his\r\nSingers with about 25 weeks of full-time work per year. His group has\r\ngone on a national tour for 15 consecutive years so far. The Singers have\r\nperformed in every state except Alaska. They have made four tours of\r\nEurope and one of the Far East. Their typical New York season included\r\nfour concerts at Alice Tully Hall and a contemporary music festival in one\r\nof the local churches. This year the three-day festival will be held in St.\r\nPeter's Church located in the Citicorp Center starting on April 20.\r\n\r\nA native of Chicago, Gregg attended college in Los Angeles and founded\r\nthe Gregg Smith Singers there in 1955. His talent as a conductor and\r\narranger soon came to the attention of the late Igor Stravinsky, the\r\nRussian-born composer who was then living in California. The pair\r\neventually recorded more than a dozen albums together. When Stravinsky\r\ndied in 1971, Gregg was invited to Venice, Italy, to prepare the chorus\r\nand orchestra for the rites in honor of the late maestro.\r\n\r\nIn all his travels, Gregg and his wife Rosalind have found no place where\r\nthey would feel so much at home as the West Side. \"It's a great,\r\nwonderful community for the classical musician,\" he says. \"It's one of the\r\nmost vibrant, alive, sometimes terrifying but always exciting, places to\r\nlive.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Gregg's rarest quality is his unselfishness toward other American\r\ncomposers. His biggest concern seems to be: how will be manage to get\r\nall their works recorded?\r\n\r\n\"I have enough important recordings to do,\" he says in a voice hovering\r\nbetween joy and frustration, \"to keep me busy for five years. That would\r\nmean literally hundreds of thousands of dollars.\" The money may come\r\nor it may not. But the worth of Gregg Smith, gentleman artist, is beyond\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER LIZ SMITH\r\nQueen of gossip\r\n\r\n3-8-80\r\n\r\nLike most of the kids she grew up with in Fort Worth, Texas during the\r\nGreat Depression, Liz Smith was star-struck by the movies. \"They told\r\nme there was a whole world out there where people were glamorous,\r\nwhere men and women drank wine with dinner and wore white tie and\r\ntails and drove cars with the tops down and danced on glass floors,\" she\r\nrecalls, smiling dreamily. Her soft, languid accent, dripping with Southern\r\ncharm, echoes through the coffee shop at the NBC building in midtown.\r\nDespite her cordiality, she somehow gives the impression of being in a\r\ngreat hurry. And for good reason: Smith is probably the hardest-working\r\n-- and certainly the most successful -- gossip writer on the East Coast.\r\n\r\nUnlike Rona Barrett, the queen of Hollywood gossip, Liz Smith does not\r\nhave a large staff, but relies on a single full-time assistant and part-time\r\n\"leg man\" in California. Nevertheless, she manages to turn out, each\r\nweek, six columns for the _New York Daily News_ (syndicated nationally\r\nto more than 60 newspapers), five radio spots for NBC, and two television\r\nspots for WNBC's _Newscenter 4_.\r\n\r\n\"The minute I get up, I go to work. I get up at about nine, and go right\r\nto work,\" says Liz. \"I look at the paper right quick, and go right to the\r\ntypewriter, and work till I finish the column at one. I work in my\r\napartment because I would never have time to get up and dress and go to\r\nanother place. I would never get to meet my deadline. ... I work all the\r\ntime. I work a lot on the weekends because that's the only time I can even\r\nvaguely make a stab at catching up. ... I just about kill myself to get\r\neverything done. I don't know if it's worth it.\"\r\n\r\nFor all her complaints, Liz believes that gossip-writing is well suited for\r\nher personality. \"I can't help it. I'm just one of those people who likes to\r\nrepeat a tale,\" she explains. \"I'd be reading every newspaper in America\r\nthat I could get my hands on and every book and magazine anyway, even\r\nif I weren't doing this job.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she was hired by the _Daily News_ in February, 1976 to start her\r\ncolumn, Liz was no stranger to the New York celebrity scene; she had\r\nalready been in the city for 26 years, working mainly as a free-lance\r\nwriter. \"I made a lot of money free-lancing. Even 15 years ago, I never\r\nmade less than $25,000 a year.\" Besides writing for virtually every mass\r\nmarket publication in America, she spent five years ghostwriting the\r\nCholly Knickerbocker society column in the old _Journal American_. Her\r\nmany contacts among the famous, and the resurgence of interest in gossip,\r\nalso helped persuade _Daily News_ editor Mike O'Neill that the paper\r\ncould use a gossip column in which the personality of the writer came\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nWithin weeks of her debut, Liz broke some of the sensational details of\r\nWoodward and Bernstein's _The Final Days_, which was about to be\r\nexcerpted in _Newsweek_. She added the TV and radio broadcasts to her\r\nschedule in 1978, and avoids duplicating items whenever possible.\r\n\r\nHer best sources, says Liz, are other journalists. \"Because they know\r\nwhat stories are. I know a lot of very serious and important writers who\r\nhave a lot of news and gossip and rumors and stuff that they don't have\r\nany place to put, so they're apt to give it to me. They have impulses to\r\ndisseminate news; I think real reporters do feel that way.\"\r\n\r\nLiz says that, generally speaking, she prefers writers to all other people.\r\nAsked to name some favorites, she bubblingly replies: \"Norman Mailer.\r\nI just think Norman is a genius. Oh God, I love so many writers. My\r\nfavorite novel recently was Peter Maas' book, _Made in America_. ...\r\nThere's Tommy Thompson, who just wrote _Serpentine_. Nora Ephrom,\r\nCarl Bernstein are friends of mine. Norman Mailer is a friend of mine.\r\nOh, I could go on forever.\"\r\n\r\nAn author in her own right, Liz wrote _The Mother Book_ two years ago;\r\nit sold approximately 65,000 copies in hardcover and 200,000 in\r\npaperback. \"It kind of wrote itself,\" she says modestly of the acclaimed\r\ncollection of anecdotes about mothers. Someday she would like to try\r\nfiction; at present she is working on a book that she describes as \"a\r\nhistory and philosophy of gossip and what it is and what it's all about.\"\r\n\r\nAn Eastsider for half her life, Liz says her neighborhood \"has the lowest\r\ncrime rate of any police district in New York.\" Most of the restaurants he\r\nfrequents are on the Upper East Side. They include Le Plaisir, Gian\r\nMarino, Szechuan East and Elaine's.\r\n\r\nFor years she saw her therapist at least once a week; now she pays him\r\njust occasional visits. \"It helped me enormously in writing. I quit having\r\nwriter's block. I quit putting things off. I quit making myself miserable.\r\nI accepted my success, which was hard, because a lot of writers: they\r\ndon't want to succeed. They don't think they deserve it. It's like people\r\nwho don't want to be happy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I mean you can be happy, you know, if you let yourself, and if\r\nyou do your work. The most important thing in the world, I think, is to\r\ndo your work. If you do your work, you'll be happy: I'm almost positive\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDERS TOM & DICK SMOTHERS\r\nStars of _I Love My Wife_ on Broadway\r\n\r\n2-17-79\r\n\r\nAs the Smothers Brothers, they were perhaps the funniest, most original\r\nAmerican music and comedy team to come out of the 1960s. Their 10\r\nalbums sold in the millions, and for three seasons they had the most\r\ncontroversial show on television, _The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour_.\r\nWhen CBS abruptly canceled their contract in 1969 for seemingly political\r\nreasons, they became a cause celebre by suing the network and winning\r\na million dollars in damages. After 18 years of performing together as a\r\nteam, they retired their act in December, 1976, saying that their brand of\r\nsatire had been \"stated,\" and that repetition would bore them. The\r\nbrothers parted on friendly terms, each determined to make his mark\r\nseparately as an entertainer.\r\n\r\nThis past Labor Day, they were reunited as a comedy team -- not on\r\ntelevision or in a nightclub, but on the stage of the Ethel Barrymore\r\nTheatre on West 47th Street, where they instantly breathed new life into\r\nthe long-running musical _I Love My Wife_. Cast in the roles of two\r\nwould-be wife swappers from Trenton, New Jersey, they insisted on being\r\nbilled not as the Smothers Brothers, but as Dick and Tom Smothers.\r\nHowever, anyone who laments the demise of the Smothers Brothers act\r\nshould catch the show before the six-month contract runs out on March 4.\r\nDick Smothers, as Wally, a smooth-talking pseudo-sophisticate, and Tom\r\nSmothers, as his naive, bumbling friend Alvin, a moving man, wear their\r\nroles as if they had been written for no one else.\r\n\r\n\"I like theatre and I'm going to do more of it,\" said Tom, 42, during a\r\nrecent dressing room interview after a matinee performance. His brother\r\nDick, 40, had other plans. \"As soon as this show is over, I have to go\r\nback to California and do some bottling for my winery. And I want to do\r\nmore auto racing. I race for American Motors. As far as making a career\r\nin acting on Broadway: no. I think I could work at it and become a fairly\r\ndecent actor, but while I'm making wine, I want to play in cabaret theatre\r\nand dinner theatre. It's fun, and it keeps you sharp. Broadway isn't a\r\nplace you should learn. What we're doing is apprenticing on Broadway.\r\n\r\n\"But that's how we got our television show,\" protested Tom. \"We'd never\r\ndone a television show before.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the box office success of their Broadway debut, Dick cannot\r\nhelp feeling disappointed that, as always, he is cast as the straight man.\r\nHis character Wally is a foil to the lovable, slow-witted Alvin. \"There's\r\nnot a whole lot to do with Wally,\" said Dick, pouring me a glass of his\r\nSmothers white Riesling wine. \"The fact is, everyone is pretty locked in\r\nexcept for Alvin. We're all dancing around him.\"\r\n\r\nTom's only complaint about the show is that it has put a strain on his\r\nhealth, and especially on his throat. \"This is the first time I've been close\r\nto the edge of anxiety healthwise,\" he confided, sipping hot tea with\r\nlemon. \"As soon as I arrived n New York I got tonsillitis. Now I have\r\ninsomnia. Antibiotics really drain your body. I've lost 15 pounds so far.\r\nIt's a very demanding part physically.\"\r\n\r\nBoth brothers seemed very serious offstage, although Tom went through\r\nhis full range of marvelous mug expressions as he answered the questions\r\nand posed for photos. Asked about how his current salary compares to\r\nwhat he has earned previously, he replied: \"Broadway you do for love of\r\nthe craft. The money is nothing to what you can make in film. You do it\r\nbecause not many actors can do theatre.\" Dick commented: \"Some of the\r\nbig stars in Las Vegas get 20 to 30 times what we're making. It's the\r\nprestige and the experience.\"\r\n\r\nTom and Dick were born on Governor's Island in New York Harbor.\r\nTheir father, an Army major, died in the Philippines near the end of\r\nWorld War II. Their mother then took them to the West Coast, and when\r\nTom was 12, she gave him a guitar. \"I wanted to be a bandleader first,\r\nthen a comedian,\" he recalled. \"At San Jose State, I was in a trio, and we\r\nneeded a tenor. So I got Dickie to come to school.\" While still in college,\r\nthey played their first professional engagement as the Smothers Brothers\r\nat San Francisco's Purple Onion nightclub and got four encores. Before\r\nlong, Jack Paar invited them on _The Tonight Show_, and their career\r\nwas assured.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is particularly touching about Tom and Dick Smothers is\r\nthe great affection they have for each other. They live in separate Upper\r\nEast Side apartments about a mile apart, but Dick drives Tom to the\r\ntheatre each day, and they frequently socialize together.\r\n\r\nTom's mind is currently on a 19th-century farce, _Nothing but the Truth_,\r\nwhich he plans to start rehearsing this fall and hopes to eventually bring\r\nto Broadway. Dick, meanwhile, is thinking more about the jeep he\r\nrecently won in a celebrity auto race. \"I'm going to drive it home to Santa\r\nCruz,\" he commented, with obvious satisfaction. \"It has four-wheel drive,\r\nbush guards, a roll bar, and heavy off-road tires. It's perfect for\r\nManhattan.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER VICTOR TEMKIN\r\nPublisher of Berkley and Jove Books\r\n\r\n1-26-80\r\n\r\nVictor Temkin, who looks like a character out of Dickens and comes\r\nacross with the gruff friendliness of television's Ed Asner, is sitting in his\r\nmidtown office on Friday afternoon trying to deal with three things at\r\nonce. The telephone is jangling, visitors are dropping by unannounced,\r\nand I'm throwing him questions about the publishing business.\r\n\r\nWhat complicates matters is that Mr. Temkin is in the process of moving\r\nhis offices to another floor; has ad and his staff of 80 are packing\r\neverything into cardboard boxes, and now it's impossible to find anything.\r\nBut the short, pink-faced man with gold-framed spectacles takes it all in\r\nstride. He lights a Lucky Strike, props one hand against his chin, and\r\nexplains how he got to be the head of Berkley Books, which has long been\r\nthe paperback division of G.P. Putnam.\r\n\r\n\"I came to New York in 1960 as a lawyer. I became assistant U.S.\r\nattorney in '61. I stayed there till '64,\" he relates in short bursts of\r\nspeech. \"Then I went into private practice until September of 1967, when\r\nI got into the book business. I became house counsel at Bantam Books,\r\nand worked my way up, and later became a vice president. I came here\r\nin July of 1977 as president and chief executive officer.\r\n\r\n\"Since that time, we purchased Jove Books from Harcourt Brace\r\nJovanovich. It's another paperback house. ... Berkley does largely reprints\r\nof hardcovers, but Jove does exclusively paperback originals. Together,\r\nthe two companies put out about 300 or 325 books a year. Of these, 120\r\nare from Jove.\"\r\n\r\nBerkley Books, he admits, is one of the smaller paperback houses, perhaps\r\nsixth or seventh. But the company manages to get its share of best-sellers.\r\nAt New Year's two were in the nation's top 10 -- _Mommie Dearest_ by\r\nChristina Crawford and _Nurse_ by Peggy Anderson. _Mommie Dearest_,\r\nsays Temkin, \"is the first time we've had a story of child abuse at that\r\nlevel off society, which I think is a great thing for the people to read. It\r\nisn't only poor kids that get beat up, it's the rich kids too -- just as\r\nbadly.\"\r\n\r\nIn terms of sales and profits, he says, \"There's no such thing as an\r\naverage book. It depends on what you pay for the advance and what the\r\ncost of manufacturing the book is. ... I can have books sell 50,000 copies\r\nand make a profit, or I can have books sell a million copies and lose\r\nmoney. ... It's not hard to spend a million dollars on a book. That's easy\r\nto do. The hard thing is to find a book like _Nurse_, where you didn't\r\npay the million for it and you can sell a million and a half. We jumped in\r\nand bought it early on, before it was a hardcover best-seller.\"\r\n\r\nBerkley's hottest author at present is John Jakes, whose seven-volume\r\nKent family saga has sold 30 million copies. Jakes' new book, _The\r\nAmericans_, is scheduled to be out in February 1980. \"The first printing\r\nis over three million copies,\" says Temkin. \"We expect it to be a number\r\none best-seller.. ... What a great success story. John has been around for\r\nmany many years and he's written a lot of books but he's never had the\r\ncommercial success until that came along. You can never tell in this\r\nbusiness. That's why we're in it: You don't know what tomorrow's going\r\nto be.\"\r\n\r\nTemkin, who anticipates losing money on seven out of 10 books he\r\npublishes, does frequently travels around the country on business, and\r\nmakes it a point to observe what people are reading on buses and in\r\nbookstores. \"I think kids today are coming back to books. Because it's the\r\nbest form of entertainment there is for the money,\" he says. \"I read a lot.\r\nI try to read two, three books a week. I have a rule that I don't read\r\nbooks by authors who are friends of mine that I am publishing, because\r\nI know it will be nothing but trouble. ... I can't tell them I don't like a\r\nbook, and if I tell them I do like it, they may not believe me. But I like\r\nwriters. I enjoy being around them.\"\r\n\r\nA native of Milwaukee, Temkin lives on the West Side with his wife\r\nSusan and their 8-year-old twins, Andrew and Peter. Susan has a busy\r\ncareer as a caterer who runs her own cooking school for kids.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1977, Berkley brought out a book about the Jonestown\r\ntragedy, _The Guyana Massacre_ by Charles Krause, which was written,\r\npublished and distributed in a single week. \"It's instant journalism,\"\r\nTemkin explains. \"We're going to do a book late in 1980 about the 1980\r\nelection, to tell how and why it happened.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughs when asked whether his skills as a lawyer have been helpful in\r\nhis publishing career. \"No, I think I've forgotten most of what I know\r\nabout being a lawyer. It's not the same.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER JOHN TESH\r\nAnchorman for WCBS Channel 2 News\r\n\r\n2-3-79\r\n\r\n\"I've had a lot of luck in my career,\" says John Tesh of WCBS Channel\r\n2 News.\"I enjoy working hard and I know exactly what I want. Who\r\nknows, 10 years from now I may not be that way. A lot of my friends are\r\nafraid I've gone too far too fast.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the first 18 years of his life, when he lived in Garden City, Long\r\nIsland, John was a top student, a star athlete, and a fine musician. After\r\ngraduating from high school he left for North Carolina to attend the state\r\nuniversity on a soccer scholarship. His goal -- to become a doctor. But\r\nwhen John returned to the New York area in 1976 at the age of 24, it was\r\nnot as a professional athlete or a physician, but as a television news\r\nreporter. Today, at 27, he is one of the most highly respected young\r\nbroadcasters in New York. Throughout the week he appears regularly on\r\nChannel 2's 6 o'clock news as an on-the-scene reporter, and each\r\nSaturday and Sunday he co-anchors both the 6 o'clock and the 11 o'clock\r\nevening news. According to Tesh, his 6 o'clock weekend show is watched\r\nby more people than any other local news program in New York.\r\n\r\nAs if this job were not enough, last September John opened his own\r\nsporting goods store, Sports Stripes, located on Columbus Avenue at 75th\r\nStreet, a few blocks from his apartment. The compact, brightly decorated\r\nstore specializes in running equipment and is the only place in New York\r\nCity where running shoes can be resoled on the premises.\r\n\r\nWhen I stop by Sports Stripes one afternoon to talk with John over lunch,\r\nthe first thing I notice is his sheer size. At 6 foot and 190 pounds, he\r\nmakes a commanding presence. There is command in his voice as well;\r\nit is as deep and rich as a Russian bass-baritone's. He seems\r\nextraordinarily calm, and when I comment on this, he says that \"there's\r\nnot as much pressure in New York as there was then I worked in North\r\nCarolina. Here you're able to concentrate solely on your reporting. There\r\nyou were concerned with logistical problems -- shooting the film,\r\ndeveloping it, editing it, selecting slides, producing the broadcast, and\r\nthen anchoring it. ... But I'm not as calm as I might appear. I think\r\npeople at Sports Stripes and CBS think of me as frenetic.\"\r\n\r\nHis entry into broadcasting was totally unplanned. Halfway through\r\ncollege, he got a part-time job as a copy boy at a local radio station. One\r\nday the station's two newsmen called in sick, and John was asked to fill\r\nin. Instantly bitten by the broadcast journalism \"bug,\" he decided to trade\r\nin his premed courses for television/radio production and political science.\r\n\r\n\"When I finished college,\" says John in his low-keyed manner, \"I had the\r\nchoice of going to medical school or continuing in broadcasting, so I felt\r\nl could go either way. I decided to stay in broadcasting for a while.\" After\r\nworking at television stations in North Carolina, Florida and Tennessee,\r\nhe was offered a job at WCBS.\r\n\r\n\"I would say that most correspondents try to get to New York, because\r\nthe production is a lot better here. ... I wouldn't like the anchor job\r\nwithout the field work,\" he adds thoughtfully. \"I have been told that my\r\nforte is breaking news. Last year I won an Emmy for that. The same year\r\nI won an Emmy for outstanding reporting.\r\n\r\n\"Unedited, live television is what it's coming to. It's interesting, because\r\nit's come full circle. At one time, everything was live. Then for some\r\nreason it went so heavily into tape, and now it's back into live journalism.\r\nAs the public becomes better informed, so changes the news.\r\n\r\n\"When Fred Cowan was holed up in a warehouse in New Rochelle, and\r\nhe had killed at least one police officer and was holding several hostages,\r\nI was in a house across the street from there. We were reporting as it was\r\nhappening. There were shots fired; I didn't realize until afterwards how\r\nintense it was.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about which skills are required for live journalism, John says: \"I\r\nthink it's being able to explain quickly and concisely the situation at hand\r\nwithout becoming too involved in the situation. Becoming the eyes and\r\nears of the viewer. Being able to ad-lib is actually what it is. [Walter]\r\nCronkite is one of the great all-time ad-libbers.\"\r\n\r\nA bachelor who lives alone, John still finds time for sports and music: \"I\r\nget enough excitement out of the store and work so that when it's time to\r\ngo home I like to be quiet. I have an electric piano, which I play with\r\nheadsets. ... I've run two marathons here in New York. I'm too big to be\r\na good marathon runner, but I do train hard. My ambition is to find some\r\nrace to win.\"\r\n\r\nJohn says he likes the West Side to much that \"my friends have to drag\r\nme to the East Side. I do all my shopping on the West Side because I\r\nfigure, why shouldn't I help out my friends who live here by shopping at\r\ntheir stores?\" When John decided to open his own store, he called up his\r\nboyhood friend Paul Abbott to run it. The pair were classmates from\r\ngrammar school through high school.\r\n\r\nJohn says he hopes to eventually open his own seafood restaurant -- \"on\r\nthe West Side, of course. This is where I plan to live for the rest of my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER RICHARD THOMAS\r\nJohn-Boy teams up with Henry Fonda in _Roots II_\r\n\r\n2-17-79\r\n\r\nSeven years ago, on Christmas Day 1972, CBS aired a holiday program\r\ntitled _The Homecoming_ about a family living in Appalachia during the\r\nGreat Depression. All who were involved in the project went their\r\nseparate ways after the filming, including a young actor from the Upper\r\nWest Side named Richard Thomas. But it drew such a favorable response\r\nthat CBS decided to turn it into a series. The rest is history: _The\r\nWaltons_ became a hit and made Thomas a television superstar.\r\n\r\nFor five years he charmed his way into American homes as the beloved\r\nJohn Boy. Then in 1976 he decided to leave _The Waltons_ in order to\r\nconcentrate on his marriage, write poetry, do stage acting, perform ballet\r\nand make movies. On February 18, in what is certain to be his most\r\nclosely watched performance to date, Richard will star in the first segment\r\nof ABCs _Roots II_, playing the son of a wealthy railroad lawyer (Henry\r\nFonda) who marries a black schoolteacher. He will appear, to a lesser\r\nextent, on the two following evenings as well, before leaving the scene as\r\na 54-year-old man.\r\n\r\nIn an interview at the New York School of Ballet at Broadway and 83rd\r\nStreet -- which is owned by his parents, Richard Thomas III and Barbara\r\nFallis -- he talks enthusiastically about his role in Roots II. \"My character\r\nis an actual historical figure,\" says Richard. \"He had just come back from\r\ncollege and didn't know what he wanted out of life. ... Obviously in 1892\r\nor 3, his marriage was considered a disaster. His wife Carrie was Alex\r\nHaley's first teacher. Her school is still in Tennessee today.\"\r\n\r\nSporting a newly grown moustache, casually dressed, and still boyish\r\nlooking at 27, Richard carries an air of tremendous confidence about him.\r\nYet his voice changes to one of awed respect when he speaks of Henry\r\nFonda: \"The thing about working with someone like Fonda is that his\r\npresence is so strongly felt that you get caught up in watching him. It's\r\nreally uncanny. I had to pinch myself to get back into the scene. And\r\nOlivia de Havilland, who plays my mother -- she's extraordinary, too. We\r\ngot along great.\"\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Richard Performed in the Los Angeles production of\r\n_Streamers_, and also made a TV movie for CBS, _Getting Married_,\r\nwhich was broadcast last summer. In the late fall, during one of his\r\nfrequent trips to the West Side, he donned ballet tights to play the\r\ncharacter role of Hilarion in the U.S. Terpsichore Company's production\r\nof _Giselle_, starring his 19-year-old sister Bronwyn Thomas, one of the\r\nmost highly acclaimed young ballerinas in the city.\r\n\r\nRichard's parents are both former principal dancers for the New York\r\nCity Ballet. They were on tour in Cuba when he was born, and the first\r\nlanguage he learned was Spanish. He began acting at the age of 7.\r\nGrowing up on West 96th Street, he attended McBurney High School and\r\nColumbia University.\r\n\r\nAlthough he moved to Los Angeles in 1971, Richard still considers\r\nhimself a Westsider. \"I just know it like the back of my hand,\" he says.\r\n\"I'm not sure I could live without LA anymore, but whenever I'm here,\r\nI feel completely at home. There's a kind of underground chic on the\r\nUpper West Side that I kind of respond to. I'm very comfortable around\r\nSpanish-speaking people. I speak Spanish, and my wife is part Mexican.\r\nI like the Latin flavor.\"\r\n\r\nHe and his wife Alma have been married since 1975; they have a 2-year\r\nold son, also named Richard Thomas. \"He talks a blue streak,\" comments\r\nthe proud father. \"Sometimes he gets very blue. You have to watch what\r\nyou say around him.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1994 the young actor published his first book of poetry. Titled simply\r\n_Poems by Richard Thomas_, it won the California Robert Frost Award\r\nthe following year. His second volume of poetry, _In The Moment_, is\r\nscheduled for publication by Avon early in 1979.\r\n\r\nAnother of his prime interests is music. \"I'm a big operagoer,\" he says.\r\n\"I'm really partial to Verdi and Wagner, if you have to get it down to\r\ntwo.\" He also plays the dulcimer. \"When I go to Kentucky this week, I'm\r\ngoing to call on a man who's one of the great dulcimer makers in the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nThe three-stringed mountain instrument, an important component in the\r\nfolk music of Appalachia, caught Richard's fancy long ago, during a visit\r\nto his grandfather's Kentucky farm, where he spent many summers as a\r\nboy. Both of his grandparents on his father's side are still living. Like an\r\nepisode from _The Waltons_, the family often gathers at the farm on\r\nThanksgiving Day.\r\n\r\nThe original _Roots_ was seen by more people than any other program in\r\nthe history of television, but Richard does not dwell on his important role\r\nin _Roots II_. He prefers to talk about the fulfillment he has found in\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n\"I can't imagine not being married at this point,\" he says, the thick gold\r\nband gleaming on his finger. \"If my marriage weren't happy, I couldn't\r\nmake the right kind of career decisions. One supports the other. They're\r\npart of the same package.\" Does he expect to have more children? Richard\r\nsmiles broadly and replies: \"That's really my wife's department.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER ANDY WARHOL\r\nPop artist and publisher of _Interview_ magazine\r\n\r\n4-7-79\r\n\r\nHe is the great enigma of American art. Some of his most famous\r\npaintings are exercises in monotony. His movies often put the viewer to\r\nsleep. As a conversationalist, he can be low-keyed to the point of dullness:\r\nspeaking softly in a slow-paced, emotionless voice, he relies heavily on\r\nshort sentences, long pauses, and an abundance of \"ums\" and \"uhs.\"\r\nHowever, he has one asset that overshadows everything negative that\r\nmight be said or written about him: his name happens to be Andy Warhol.\r\n\r\nThe only time I met Warhol in person was at a book publication party\r\nseveral months ago. He came by himself, spoke to hardly anyone, and\r\nspent most of his brief visit flitting quietly about the room, avoiding\r\npeople's eyes and taking snapshots of the more celebrated guests. With his\r\npale complexion, narrow frame, and hair like bleached straw, he looked\r\nnot unlike a scarecrow. Everywhere he went, heads turned to catch a\r\nglimpse. That has been the story of Warhol's life ever since he rose to\r\ninternational prominence in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nAlthough he did not feel like talking when I met him, Andy -- never\r\npublicity-shy -- agreed to a telephone interview at a later date. Reached\r\nat the offices of his _Interview_ magazine off Union Square, he answered\r\nall my questions briefly, and in a voice so low that he could barely be\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n_Interview_, the monthly tabloid-shaped magazine that he publishes, is\r\nWarhol's most visible creative project at the moment. \"It's been going for\r\nabout seven or eight years,\" he said. \"I started it for Brigid Berlin. Her\r\nfather ran the Hearst Corporation. She didn't want to work on it.\" The\r\nperson on the cover of each issue is identified only on the inside, and\r\nmany of the faces are difficult to recognize. Some are genuine celebrities,\r\nsuch as Truman Capote, who has a regular column. Others are young\r\nunknowns who have caught Warhol's fancy. The ultramodern layout\r\nincludes many full-page ads for some of the most expensive shops in\r\nManhattan. The interviews, interspersed with many photos, lean heavily\r\non show business personalities, models, artists, writers and fashion\r\npeople. In most cases, the \"interviews\" are actually group discussions --\r\noften with Andy himself taking part -- that are printed verbatim. Even the\r\nmost mundane comments are not cut.\r\n\r\nThe reason? \"I used to carry a tape recorder with me all the time, so this\r\nwas a way to use it,\" said Warhol. But in truth, the literal transcriptions\r\nare another example of the naturalism that characterizes much of his work.\r\nWhen he turned his attention from painting and drawing to filmmaking in\r\n1963, he became notorious for such movies as _Sleep_, which showed a\r\nman sleeping for six hours, and _Empire_, which he made by aiming his\r\ncamera at the Empire State Building and keeping the film running for\r\neight straight hours.\r\n\r\nAccording to Warhol, many people have turned down his request for\r\ninterviews. \"It's hard to get Robert Redford. ... We choose people who\r\nlike to talk a lot.\" The type of reader he seeks to attract is \"the rich\r\naudience. People who go to places like Christie's and Fiorucci's. ... It's\r\nfun to go to those places and get invited to parties. I love fashion parties.\r\nShoe parties are even better.\"\r\n\r\nHis affection for shoes dates back to 1949, when, in his first year in New\r\nYork, he got a job in the art department of a shoe store. His designs and\r\nmagazine illustrations caught on so fast that within a year, he was able to\r\npurchase the town house on the Upper East Side, where he still lives with\r\nhis mother. \"But mostly I live with my two dachshunds. They've taken\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nCertain facts abut Andy Warhol's early life remain a mystery because he\r\nhas always objected to questions that he considers irrelevant to an\r\nunderstanding of him as an artist. It is known that he was born somewhere\r\nin Pennsylvania, sometime between 1927 and 1931, to a family of\r\nimmigrants from Czechoslovakia named Warhola.\r\n\r\nBy his mid-20s, Warhol was one of the most sought-after commercial\r\nartists in the field. His silk-screen prints of Campbell's soup cans made\r\nhim famous with the general public, and by the mid-1960s he was clearly\r\nthe most highly celebrated \"plastic artist\" -- a title he relishes -- in the\r\nEnglish-speaking world.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, his creative output has been reduced somewhat, as the\r\nresult of the severe wounds he sustained in June, 1968, when a deranged\r\nwoman shot him in his office. Nevertheless, he continues to mount gallery\r\nexhibitions, write books and paint portraits. The Whitney Museum (75th\r\nSt. at Madison Ave.) will have a show of his portraits in December.\r\n\r\nAsked about the East Side, Warhol said that one of his favorite activities\r\nis to go window shopping. \"When you live on the East Side, you don't\r\nhave to go far. Because usually everything happens here.\" When he goes\r\nto the West Side, it's often to visit Studio 54. \"I only go there to see my\r\nfriend Steve Rubell. Afterwards, we usually go to Cowboys and\r\nCowgirls.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the only medium that Warhol has not worked in is television. \"Oh,\r\nI always wanted to, yeah,\" was his parting comment. \"It just never\r\nhappens. The stations think we're not Middle America.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER ARNOLD WEISSBERGER\r\nTheatrical attorney for superstars\r\n\r\n9-29-79\r\n\r\nWhat do Leonard Bernstein, Helen Hayes, Otto Preminger, Carol\r\nChanning, Truman Capote and George Balanchine have in common?\r\n\r\nAll are giants in the performing arts. And all are -- or have been -- clients\r\nof Arnold Weissberger, one of the world's foremost theatrical attorneys.\r\nNow in his 50th year of practice, the Brooklyn-born, Westside-raised\r\nWeissberger has been representing stars ever since a chance encounter\r\nbrought Orson Welles to his office in 1936.\r\n\r\n\"Most of my clients are involved in making contracts that have to do with\r\nplays or films or television,\" says Weissberger on a recent afternoon. The\r\nscene is his small, richly furnished law firm in the East 50s. Dressed in\r\na dark suit, with a white carnation in his buttonhole to match his white\r\nmustache, Weissberger looks very much like the stereotype of a business\r\ntycoon. \"Part of my job,\" he continues, \"is to be familiar with the rules\r\nof guilds and unions. And I have to know about the treaties between\r\ncountries that affect the payment of taxes.\"\r\n\r\nSmiling benevolently, his hands folded in front of him, the gentlemanly\r\nlawyer quickly proves himself a gifted storyteller. In his upper-class\r\nBoston accent, acquired during seven years at Harvard, he delights in\r\ntelling anecdotes about his favorite performers. Not shy about dropping\r\nnames, Weissberger drops only the biggest, such as Sir Laurence Olivier\r\n-- a client who had invited him to lunch the previous day -- and Martha\r\nGraham.\r\n\r\nHis work is so crowded that whenever he has to read anything that is\r\nlonger than three pages, he puts it in his weekend bag. Yet Weissberger\r\ndevotes an hour or two every day to one of several philanthropic\r\norganizations. At the top of his list is the Martha Graham Center of\r\nContemporary Dance, of which he is co-chairman. \"I consider her one of\r\nthe three great seminal figures in the arts in the 20th century, and I prize\r\nher friendship enormously.\" The other two outstanding artistic figures of\r\nthe century, he says, are \"Stravinsky, who it was also my privilege to\r\nrepresent, and Picasso, who I did not represent.\"\r\n\r\nHe serves as chairman of the New Dramatists, a group that nurtures\r\nyoung playwrights; he is a board member of Fountain House, a halfway\r\nhouse for ex-mental patients; and he is chairman of the Theatre and Music\r\nCollection of the Museum of the City of New York.\r\n\r\nOn Monday through Thursday, Weissberger lives in a luxurious Eastside\r\napartment that he shares with his longtime friend, theatrical agent Milton\r\nGoldman. Each Friday after work, Weissberger departs for Seacliff, Long\r\nIsland, where he owns a house overlooking the ocean. Goldman and\r\nWeissberger, whose careers have run a parallel course during the 35 years\r\nof their acquaintance, travel widely each summer, generally spending a\r\nmonth in London, where both have many clients.\r\n\r\n\"Our interests are very similar, except that I am an opera buff, and Milton\r\nis not. He's a realist. I started going to opera when I was 10 years old, so\r\nI don't mind if a 300-pound soprano dies of consumption in _Traviata_,\r\nas long as she sings beautifully.\"\r\n\r\nAn avid art collector, Weissberger buys only what he has room to display\r\non the walls of his home and office. For the past 30 years his chief hobby\r\nhas been photography. He has published two volumes of his work --\r\n_Close Up_ (1967) and _Famous Faces_ (1971). Although he has never\r\ntaken a photography course, and never uses flash, he captures the essence\r\nof his subjects through his rapport with them. \"I have discussed the\r\npossibility of doing a photo book of children I've taken around the\r\nworld,\" he notes. \"And now, of course, I have enough photos for a\r\nsecond volume of famous faces.\"\r\n\r\nHis vigorous appearance to the contrary, Weissberger claims to get little\r\nexercise. \"I have one of those stationary bicycles at home, but I've never\r\ngotten round to using it. And I've got to do so before I next see my\r\ndoctor, or I won't be able to face him. ... It's interesting how doctorial\r\nadvice changes. I remember several years ago, it was not considered a\r\ngood idea for people who were no longer young to climb stairs, and now\r\nmy doctor says that climbing stairs is the best thing I can do for my\r\nconstitution.\"\r\n\r\nSo closely connected are the various aspects of his life that Weissberger\r\nis able to say: \"There's no demarcation between my workday and my play\r\nday. People ask me when I'm going to retire, and I say there's no need\r\nfor me to retire, because I enjoy my work so much. I become part of\r\npeople's lives. I become privy to their problems. It is, in many ways, an\r\nextension, an enhancement of my own life to be able to participate in the\r\nlives of my clients. I remember a few months ago, when Lilli Palmer was\r\nsitting right there, and I said, 'Lilli, what a lucky person I am. I'm having\r\nto do a tax return and I'm doing it for Lilli Palmer.' Because there sat this\r\nbeautiful, charming, intelligent, lovely lady, and I was representing her\r\nprofessionally. For me, I can't think of any profession that could possibly\r\nbe more rewarding.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER TOM WICKER\r\nAuthor and columnist for the _New York Times_\r\n\r\n6-2-79\r\n\r\nSomething unusual was happening up ahead: that much he was sure of,\r\nalthough no sound of gunshots reached Tom Wicker's ears as he rode in\r\na press bus in the presidential motorcade through the streets of Dallas on\r\nNovember 22, 1963. Gazing out the window, he observed crowds of\r\npeople running about in confusion. Shortly afterward, outside Parkland\r\nHospital, the full extent of the tragedy was announced to the world, and\r\nTom Wicker, the only reporter from the _New York Times_ who was\r\npresent that day, rushed off to write the biggest story of his career.\r\n\r\nWorking feverishly through the afternoon, he came up with a 106\r\nparagraph account of the day's events that dominated the _Times'_ front\r\npage the following morning. In decades to come, students and historians\r\nwill turn to Wicker's story on microfilm with perhaps a sense of wonder\r\nthat it omits no facts of major importance, and contains virtually no\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\nTom Wicker was writing for history that day, and largely as a result of\r\nhis masterful performance, he was elevated the following year to the\r\nposition of the _Times_ bureau chief in Washington. In 1968, he was\r\nappointed associate editor of the newspaper, and in 1971, he returned to\r\nNew York in order to concentrate on his column, \"In the Nation.\" For the\r\npast 13 years, the column has appeared three times weekly in the op-ed\r\npage of the _Times._\r\n\r\nA tall, ruddy-complexioned, powerful-looking Southerner of 52 with a\r\ncountry-boy manner and a Carolina accent as thick as molasses, Wicker\r\nhas managed to combine his lifelong career in journalism with an\r\nindependent career as a book author. The most successful of his seven\r\nnovels, _Facing the Lions_, was on the _New York Times_ best-seller list\r\nfor 18 weeks in 1973, while his most recent nonfiction work, _On Press:\r\nA Top Reporter's Life in, and Reflections on, American Journalism_, was\r\npublished last year by Viking and will soon be released as a paperback by\r\nBerkley.\r\n\r\nIn an interview at his office in the _Times_ building, the affable, articulate\r\nWicker responds to an opening question about whether journalists are less\r\naccurate today than in the past by saying, \"No, I don't think they ever\r\nwere very accurate. It's hard to get pinpoint accuracy under pressure. I\r\nthink that's an inherent weakness of daily journalism. But you have to\r\nconsider that there are something like eight million words a day coming\r\nin here. It's very tough to double-check all of that by deadline. I think of\r\njournalism as being kind of like an early alert system.\"\r\n\r\nIn his column, Wicker has never been told what to write, never had an\r\narticle killed or edited, and never been urged to conform to the _Times_\r\neditorial policy.\r\n\r\nSome of his pieces look best in retrospect -- for example, the three\r\ncolumns he wrote in September and October 1977 about the dangers of\r\nstoring nuclear waste. The sympathy with which he treated the prison\r\ndeath of convict George Jackson in a 1971 column caught the attention of\r\ninmates everywhere, and during the uprising at New York's Attica prison\r\nlater that year, he was called in as a mediator and official observer. His\r\nbook about the uprising, _A Time To Die_, (1975), won him two major\r\nliterary awards and was made a Book of the Month Club selection.\r\n\r\nAn engaging public speaker who travels widely, he spent two months in\r\nAfrica last year. At present, he is preparing a long article on Richard\r\nNixon that will appear in the _Sunday Times_ magazine this August to\r\ncoincide with the fifth anniversary of the ex-president's resignation.\r\n\r\nAsked for his opinion on the seeming resurgence of Nixon as a public\r\nfigure, Wicker smiles and says, \"I'm sure Al Capone could have drawn\r\na crowd the day he got out of prison. I don't think Nixon has been\r\nrevived. He never was dead in that sense. He left the White House under\r\na cloud, yet he retained, I am sure, millions of people who supported him.\r\n... I myself have always discounted these reports that some future\r\nRepublican president might appoint him a sort of roving ambassador. As\r\nfar as his giving speeches at big colleges is concerned, I think that's all\r\nright. He may have made mistakes, but I myself would find it very\r\ninteresting to read an article by Richard Nixon about foreign affairs. I\r\nthink he's a man of intelligence and knowledge in this area.\"\r\n\r\nFor the past five years, Wicker has been married to Pamela Hill, vice\r\npresident of ABC News and executive producer of the network's\r\ndocumentary productions. They live in a four-story brownstone on the\r\nUpper East Side. Though both enjoy cooking, their busy schedules call for\r\nmany visits to local restaurants.\r\n\r\nWicker's next book is a historical novel about the American Civil War\r\nthat he has been researching for several years. \"It probably won't be\r\ncompleted until 1981,\" he says, \"but I expect it to be the best book I have\r\never done. It's certainly the one I'm putting the most effort into. At the\r\nsame time, the column is my first priority. That's the clock I punch. ...\r\nMy experience is, the more you write, the better you get at it. It's a\r\nbusiness in which you keep sharpening your tools all the time.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nEASTSIDER TOM WOLFE\r\nAvant-garde author talks about _The Right Stuff_\r\n\r\n10-6-79\r\n\r\nDuring New York City's newspaper strike of 1963, a 31-year-old _Herald\r\nTribune_ reporter named Tom Wolfe visited California in order to write\r\nan article for _Esquire_ magazine about the souped-up, customized cars\r\nand the crowd they attracted. When _Esquire's_ deadline arrived, Wolfe\r\nwas unable to pull the article together, so he typed out his largely\r\nimpressionistic notes and sent them to the editor, who decided to run \"The\r\nKandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby\" exactly as written.\r\nThus was Tom Wolfe established as one of the most important new talents\r\nin American journalism.\r\n\r\nToday he is generally recognized as the foremost proponent of what might\r\nbe called the nonfiction short story. The majority of his eight books are\r\ncollections of factual articles written in the style of fiction. His latest\r\neffort, _The Right Stuff_ (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $12.95), is about the\r\nseven Mercury astronauts and the world of military flying. Over cocktails\r\nat the Isle of Capri, a restaurant not far from his Eastside apartment, the\r\nslender, gentlemanly, and slightly bashful author spoke at length about his\r\nnew book and a dozen other subjects. Dressed in a one-button,\r\nswallowtail, yellow pinstriped suit -- \"it's kind of an early Duke of\r\nWindsor\" -- he poured forth his colorful phrases in a rich, soothing,\r\nmildly Southern accent that rang with sincerity.\r\n\r\n\"I began this book in 1972, when _Rolling Stone_ asked me to go down\r\nto the Cape and cover Apollo 17. Somewhat to my surprise, I became\r\nquite interested in the whole business of: what's the makeup of someone\r\nwho's willing to sit on top of a rocket and let you light the candle? And\r\nI ended up writing four stories for _Rolling Stone_ ... in about a month.\r\nAnd I thought if I spent a couple of months in expanding them, I'd have\r\na book. Well, it's now 1979 and here we are.\" He laughed heartily. \"It\r\nwas so difficult that I put it aside every opportunity I had. I wrote three\r\nother books in the meantime, to avoid working on it.\r\n\r\n\"I ended up being more interested in the fraternity of flying than in space\r\nexploration. I found the reactions of people and flying conditions much\r\nmore fascinating. So the book is really about the right stuff -- the code of\r\nbravery that the pilots live by, and the mystical belief about what it takes\r\nto be a hot fighter jock.\r\n\r\n\"Flying has a competitive structure that's as hotly contested as the world\r\nof show business. And the egos are just as big -- in fact, in a way, they're\r\nbigger. ... It's hard to top surgeons for sheer ego. I think surgeons are the\r\nmost egotistical people on the face of the earth, but pilots usually make\r\nthe playoffs: they're in there.\"\r\n\r\nAn excellent caricaturist who has published hundreds of drawings and\r\nmounted several major exhibitions, he confessed to being vain about his\r\nartwork because \"I don't feel as sure of myself as I do in writing.\" A\r\nbook of his drawings will come out in 1980. He also has a captioned\r\ndrawing each month in _Harper's_, the magazine where his wife Sheila\r\nworks as art director. Tom was a lifelong bachelor until they were\r\nmarried last year.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in New York in 1962, armed with a Ph.D. from Yale and\r\nthree years' experience on the _Washington Post_. \"I really love it in New\r\nYork. It reminds me of the state fair in Virginia, where I grew up. ... The\r\npicture of the East Side really is of the man living in the $525,000 co-op,\r\nleaving the building at night with his wife, both clothed in turtleneck\r\nsweaters with pieces of barbed wire and jeans, going past a doorman who\r\nis dressed like an Austrian Army colonel from 1870.\"\r\n\r\nNo relation to the novelist Thomas Wolfe, Tom Wolfe has written only\r\none short piece of fiction in his life. He is now thinking about writing \"a\r\n_Vanity Fair_ type of novel about New York\" as his next major\r\nundertaking. In the meantime, he is working on a sequel to _The Painted\r\nWord_, his book-length essay abut modern art that appeared in 1975.\r\n\r\n\"Another thing I'd like to try is a movie script,\" he added. \"I've done one\r\n-- a series of vignettes about life in Los Angeles. ... But many talented\r\nwriters just go bananas in trying to write for the movies. Because they're\r\nnot in charge of what they're doing. All that a good director can do is\r\nkeep from ruining the script. He cannot turn a bad script into a good\r\nmovie. He can turn a good script into a bad movie. And often, I think, it\r\nhappens, because the director is given a power that he simply should not\r\nhave.\"\r\n\r\nAnother possible project, said Wolfe, is a second volume of _The Right\r\nStuff_, to bring the story up to the $250 million Soviet-American\r\nhandshake in 1975. The 436-page first volume has been received with\r\nacclaim. In the _New York Sunday Times_ book review, C.D.B. Bryan\r\nwrote: \"It is Tom Wolfe at his very best. ... It is technically accurate,\r\nlearned, cheeky, risky, touching, tough, compassionate, nostalgic,\r\nworshipful, jingoistic -- it is superb.\"\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAn Interview with Tom Wolfe\r\n\r\nfrom _The Westsider_, 11-22-79\r\n\r\nTom Wolfe, one of the most original stylists in American writing today,\r\nburst spectacularly on the literary horizon in 1965 with _The Kandy\r\nKolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby_, a collection of articles about\r\ncontemporary American life written as nonfiction.\r\n\r\nWolfe's adoption of stream of consciousness, his unorthodox use of italics\r\nand exclamation marks, his repetition of letters, and his effectiveness in\r\ninventing hip phrases with nonsense words and classical references, helped\r\nestablish an entirely new literary form -- the nonfiction short story.\r\n\r\nHis reputation was cemented by such books as _The Electric Kool-Aid\r\nAcid Test_, _The Pump House Gang_ and _The Painted Word_, a lengthy\r\nessay on modern art. Wolfe sometimes illustrates his work with pen-and\r\nink drawings.\r\n\r\nHis latest book, _The Right Stuff_, deals with the age of rockets, the early\r\nastronauts and the world of military flying. Published in September 1979,\r\nit is a critical and commercial success that has already hit the best-seller\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nA tall, slender 48-year-old transplanted Southerner with a rich baritone\r\nvoice, Wolfe speaks softly, chooses his word carefully, and exhibits a\r\nkind of schoolboy bashfulness when discussing his own work. A New\r\nYorker since 1962, he lives on the Upper East Side with his wife Sheila,\r\nthe art director of _Harper's_ magazine. On the day of our interview,\r\nWolfe is wearing his customary one-button, swallow-tailed, yellow pin\r\nstripe suit, which he describes as \"early Duke of Windsor.\"\r\n\r\nQ:        What made you decide to write this book?\r\n\r\nA:        Back in 1972, Rolling Stone asked me to go down to the Cape and\r\ncover Apollo 17. That was the last mission to the moon. ... Somewhat to\r\nmy surprise, I really became quite interested in the whole business of\r\nwhat's the makeup of someone who's willing to sit on top of a rocket and\r\nlet you light the candle? And I ended up writing four stories for _Rolling\r\nStone_ in about a month. And I thought if I spent a couple of months in\r\nexpanding them, I'd have a book. Well, it's now 1979 and here we are.\"\r\n(He laughs.) It was so difficult that I put it aside every opportunity I had.\r\nI wrote three other books in the meantime, to avoid working on it.\r\n\r\nI ended up being more interested in the fraternity of flying than in space\r\nexploration. I found the reactions of people and flying conditions much\r\nmore fascinating. So the book is really about the right stuff -- the code of\r\nbravery that the pilots live by, and the mystical belief about what it takes\r\nto be a hot fighter jock, as the expression goes. I became interested in\r\npeople like Chuck Yeager, who broke the sound barrier back in 1947.\r\nWhen the seven Mercury astronauts were chosen, they were not the seven\r\nhottest test pilots in America, although they were presented as such at the\r\ntime. The arrival of the astronauts as a type completely upset the\r\ncompetitive hierarchy of flying.\r\n\r\nFlying has a competitive structure that's as hotly contested as the world\r\nof show business. And the egos are just as big -- in fact, in a way, they're\r\nbigger. . ... It's hard to top surgeons for sheer ego. I think surgeons are\r\nthe most egotistical people on the face of the earth, but pilots usually\r\nmake the playoffs: they're in there.\r\n\r\nQ:        Speaking of your other books: how do you manage to know all the\r\nhip phrases of the day? Do you spend a lot of time with teenagers?\r\n\r\nA:        At one time, people thought I was some sort of medium who hung\r\naround with children to pick up what young people were thinking and\r\ndoing. Well, that interested me very much in the '60s, when suddenly\r\nyoung people were doing extraordinary things -- things they had never\r\ndone, which really boiled down to living lives that they controlled,\r\nsometimes in a communal way, going with their own styles, rather than\r\nimitating that of their elders. So it was fascinating. I made a point of\r\nlearning about it.\r\n\r\nSometimes now I turn on the radio and I don't recognize a single song on\r\nthe charts. Right now I have no idea what any of the top 20 singles are.\r\nAnd I have the feeling that it's probably not worth finding out, because\r\nwe're now in a phase where we're just filling in the spaces of what was\r\nintroduced by rock and the Beatles and the Grateful Dead and so on.\r\nThere's nothing very new, I don't think. Maybe I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nQ:        How do you choose your clothes?\r\n\r\nA:        Right now I'm in the phase of pretentiousness. During the late '60s\r\nI had a lot of fun by making mild departures in style -- wearing white\r\nsuits instead of blue suits, things like that. That was very shocking and\r\nunusual in 1963. Suddenly things reached a point beyond which it really\r\nwasn't worth going, as far as I was concerned, when Jerry Rubin and\r\nAbbie Hoffman appeared on the _Dick Cavett Show_ in body paint.\r\n\r\nThere's one direction in which clothes can go that still annoys the hell out\r\nof people, and that's pretentiousness. If you wear double-breasted\r\nwaistcoats, which I rather like, that annoys people. Spats more than annoy\r\npeople: they infuriate people. Try it sometime if you don't believe me.\r\nThey think that this is an affront. It stirs up all sorts of resentment. We're\r\nin a period now in which the picture of the East Side really is of the man\r\nliving in the $525,000 co-op, leaving the building at night, both clothed\r\nin turtleneck sweaters with pieces of barbed wire and jeans, going past a\r\ndoorman who is dressed like an Austrian Army colonel from 1870.\r\n\r\nQ:        Do you do a lot of drawing?\r\n\r\nA:        I have a regular feature in _Harper's_. I do one large drawing each\r\nmonth, with a caption.\r\n\r\nQ:        What's your artistic background?\r\n\r\nA:        I never was trained in art. I worked for a commercial artist a number\r\nof summers when I was in high school. And I learned anatomy from\r\ndrawing boxers in _Ring_ magazine. It was the only way I could think of\r\nto learn anatomy.\r\n\r\nI've had two gallery shows of drawings. ... And I'll have a book of\r\ndrawings coming out next year. I find myself very vain about my\r\ndrawing. I guess I don't feel as sure of myself as I do in writing;\r\ntherefore I'm always straining to get people's reactions to what I've\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\nWhat I do mostly is caricature. I try not to make them too cartoony. This\r\nis a period that absolutely cries out for good caricature. Part of it is that\r\nthe great caricaturists used to be people who were determined to be fine\r\nartists. Every artist, whether he was good or bad, learned anatomy very\r\nthoroughly. He learned how to render landscapes, buildings, and learned\r\nsomething about costume. So the ones who didn't make it as easel painters\r\nmight turn to doing caricature, and some of them were spectacular.\r\n\r\nWe all grow up thinking we're in an era of progress, because we have had\r\nso much technological progress. But it simply doesn't work that way in\r\nart and literature. We're living in an era -- to use Mencken's phrase -- of\r\nthe \"Sahara of the beaux arts.\"\r\n\r\nI wrote about that in _The Painted Word_. In fact, I'm doing a sequel to\r\nthat now. It will be an article for _Harper's_ magazine. I'm moving into\r\nthe areas of architecture and serious music and dance. It's very enjoyable\r\nto work on a subject like that after a long haul of writing about astronauts\r\n-- essentially because it's easier.\r\n\r\nQ:        What do you like to watch on TV?\r\n\r\nA:        To be honest, my two favorite shows are _Mannix_ -- which, alas,\r\nis no longer except in reruns -- and the _Johnny Carson Show_. I just\r\nthink he's terrific. It was such a common currency among those in the\r\ngeneral category of intellectuals to like the _Dick Cavett Show_ and not\r\nthe _Johnny Carson Show_. And that is so much the party line that it\r\ntakes awhile to dawn on you that Carson is really extremely funny. Dick\r\nCavett, he has a lot of talent, but when it comes to wit, and even in\r\nhandling the language, he's simply not in Carson's league.\r\n\r\nThere are a whole bunch of shows, I must say, in which I simply don't\r\nknow who these people are. A lot of general-circulation magazines today\r\nare really television magazines. _People_ magazine is a television\r\nmagazine. Look at these people. Who are they? Who are Mindy and\r\nMork? I mean, I've never seen the show. And yet, they're obviously\r\nextremely well-known.\r\n\r\nThese magazines now, in an era in which general circulation magazines\r\nare in trouble, have hit upon this idea: all these people that are watching\r\ntelevision will have the thrill of recognition if we write about the people\r\nthey've seen on television. So _Sports Illustrated_ will tend to give you\r\na kind of a rehash of the game of the week or the fight that everyone saw\r\non television. It's kind of funny. At first, television was always\r\ncannibalizing the printed word for material, and now it's suddenly turning\r\naround.\r\n\r\nQ:        Do you have any other major projects coming up?\r\n\r\nA:        For years I've been telling myself that I was going to try a _Vanity\r\nFair_ type of novel about New York, and I think I should probably try to\r\nmake myself tackle that next. I've debated whether to make it fiction or\r\nnonfiction. My fiction writing has been confined to one short story that I\r\ndid for _Esquire_. And I was surprised that it was harder than I thought\r\nto write fiction. I thought that I could sit down on a Sunday afternoon and\r\nknock out a short story, because you could make things up.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like to try is a movie script. I've done one -- a series of\r\nvignettes about life in Los Angeles. ... But many talented writers just go\r\nbananas in trying to write for the movies. Because they're not in charge\r\nof what they're doing. All that a good director can do is keep from\r\nruining the script. He cannot turn a bad script into a good movie. He can\r\nturn a good script into a bad movie. And often, I think, it happens,\r\nbecause the director is given a power that he simply should not have.\r\n\r\nQ:        Do you feel a lot of pressure on yourself when you sit down at the\r\ntypewriter, as being one of the trend-setters in American writing today?\r\n\r\nA:        It was terrible after my first book came out, and I suddenly got a lot\r\nof publicity I never dreamed I'd get. I was still working with the _Herald\r\nTribune_ as a general assignment reporter at the city desk. And I suddenly\r\nwas made aware by publicity that there was something called the Tom\r\nWolfe style. And this can really do terrible things to you. I wrote a whole\r\nseries of just dreadful article because the first phase I went through was:\r\n\"Well, I'll be damned. I have the Tom Wolfe style, I guess I'd better use\r\nit.\" And so I started writing these self-parodies. The second phase was:\r\n\"I've got to stop this. It's self-destructive.\" And I would write something\r\nand a bell would go off and I'd say, \"That's Tom Wolfe style. Now is\r\nthat good the way I've used it there, or it is bad the way I've used it?\"\r\nAnd this became very troublesome.\r\n\r\nWhen I did this book, _The Right Stuff_, I decided I really was going to\r\ntry to tailor my language to the mental atmosphere of pilots, and somehow\r\nmake my tone what I have elsewhere called the downstage voice. You're\r\nwriting in the third person about other people, but your own writing style\r\ntakes on their tone. So I think the result is a book that seems different in\r\nstyle, and is sort of an experiment for me.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nWESTSIDER PINCHAS ZUKERMAN\r\nViolinist and conductor\r\n\r\n10-13-79\r\n\r\n\"Travel is not fun anymore,\" sighs world-renowned violinist, violist and\r\nconductor Pinchas Zukerman. \"It used to be. Now there are all the checks\r\nand securities at airports, and the hotel standards have gone down. The\r\nold-style luxury hotel is gone. Now it's a businessman's Ramada Inn, kind\r\nof hit-and-run hotel. But you learn to live with it.\"\r\n\r\nSince making his American debut with the New York Philharmonic under\r\nLeonard Bernstein 11 years ago, he has been a soloist with every major\r\norchestra in Europe, and acted as both conductor and soloist for most of\r\nthe leading orchestras in America. His schedule of 120 concerts a year is\r\nsolidly booked until 1982, and he has a discography of several dozen\r\nrecordings on four labels. For personal credits, Pinchas -- or \"Pinky,\" as\r\nhe prefers to be called -- has lived on the West Side for 17 years, been\r\nmarried to Eugenia Zukerman for 12 of those years. They have two\r\ndaughters, one of whom is a skilled pianist.\r\n\r\nThe _New York Times_ has called him \"one of the world's leading\r\nviolinists,\" the _London Times_ has said he is \"absolutely without peer,\"\r\nand the _Washington Post_ has labeled him \"the most versatile of all\r\nmajor musicians.\" Born in Israel, the son of Polish survivors of\r\nAuschwitz, he was invited to perform at the White House last year for\r\nEgyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem\r\nBegin. \"I want to tell Sadat he should set up a recording studio inside the\r\npyramids,\" he joked before the event. This year, Pinky's greatest honor\r\nwas his appointment as music director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra,\r\nthe only full-time chamber orchestra in America.\r\n\r\nBut the most astonishing thing about this burly, muscular man who speaks\r\nnostalgically of the \"old days,\" may be his age. He's 31.\r\n\r\n\"I think I had as normal a childhood as one could expect from a talented\r\nboy that had to work,\" he muses in his living room overlooking the\r\nHudson River. Serious one moment, clownish the next, he frequently\r\npunctuates his remarks with loud belly laughter. Pinky's sense of humor\r\nis one of the things that endears him to his close friend, violinist Itzhak\r\nPerlman, who lives six floors above. They were born three years apart,\r\ngrew up a few miles from each other, and both came to New York with\r\nthe help of violinist Isaac Stern to study at Juilliard.\r\n\r\nThe pair sometimes travel together for concerts, and according to Eugenia\r\nZukerman, \"they do things like imitate apes at airports.\" Eugenia herself\r\nis an extraordinary woman. Besides being a wife and mother, she is a\r\nflutist with an international music career of her own, frequently appearing\r\nin recitals with her husband. In addition, she is a highly talented writer\r\nwho has written free-lance articles for many leading publications, and now\r\ndevotes three or four hours a day to her first novel.\r\n\r\nOn October 19 at 10 p.m., and for the next three Friday evenings,\r\nChannel 13 will present a series called _Here to Make Music_, which\r\ndocuments Pinchas Zukerman's musical collaborations with Perlman,\r\nStern and others. Zukerman's life story is told through the use of\r\nrecordings he made before the age of 10, old photographs and candid\r\ninterviews, producing a portrait that is often fascinating.\r\n\r\n\"I think music on TV is getting definitely better in America. They're\r\nahead of the game at the BBC and in Europe, but they're quickly catching\r\nup here,\" he notes. \"Sometimes they overcompensate with pictures for the\r\nsake of making a so-called 'interesting' show for the guy sitting with his\r\nslippers in the living room, drinking a glass of beer. They're afraid to\r\nleave the camera on the same musician for three minutes. That's why\r\nyou've got this flute playing, and you see this horn player picking his\r\nnose.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I ask Pinky about critics, the color rises in his cheeks. \"Don't get\r\nme on critics,\" he warns, before launching into an unrestrained diatribe.\r\n\"First of all, they're not critics as far as I'm concerned. They should be\r\nreporters. But they never report what goes on in the concert hall. The\r\npublic stood up and clapped for 10 minutes. Say it, damn it! Don't say\r\nthat bar 56 was not right in the Beethoven G Major Sonata. Who cares?\r\nIt's so stupid!\r\n\r\n\"I'm a great fiddle player. They all say that. Fine. It's understood, it's\r\ngranted. It's there. Okay. So instead of criticizing my fiddle playing, they\r\nsay I'm becoming aloof, and this and that. ... One week they tear me to\r\nshreds for my conducting. The next week I get these rave reviews. Now,\r\nhow can one person be that different in one week? What do they think,\r\nthat I'm a duet?\"\r\n\r\nAsked how much time he spends practicing, Pinky replies: \"As much as\r\nI need to. I don't think about time. You either live music or you don't. ...\r\nMusic is an unending art form which demands your complete attention and\r\nperfection at all times. What a wonderful thing to be able to say -- I'll be\r\nable to say it in maybe 15 or 20 years -- that I have gone through all of\r\nSchubert's works. What an incredible achievement that is! I can tell you,\r\nit's a lot more satisfying than flying an airplane.\"\r\n\r\n                               -- THE END --",
