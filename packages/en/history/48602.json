Of these,\r\nthe most important is the _catalogue raisonné_ of early Norman\r\ncastles in England which will be found in Chapter VII., and which was\r\noriginally published in the _English Historical Review_ (vol. xix.,\r\n1904). It has, however, been enlarged by the inclusion of five fresh\r\ncastles, and by notes upon thirty-four others, of which the article in\r\nthe _Review_ gave only the names; the historical notes in that essay\r\nbeing confined to the castles mentioned in Domesday Book.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on Irish mottes appeared in the _Antiquary_ (vol. xlii.,\r\n1906), but it has been revised, corrected, and added to. Portions of a\r\nstill earlier paper, read before the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland\r\nin March 1900, are incorporated in various parts of the book, but these\r\nhave been recast in the fuller treatment of the subject which is aimed\r\nat here.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the work is entirely new. No serious attempt had been made\r\nto ascertain the exact nature of Saxon and Danish fortifications by a\r\ncomparison of the existing remains with the historical records which\r\nhave come down to us, until the publication of Mr Allcroft's valuable\r\nbook on _Earthwork of England_. The chapters on Saxon and Danish\r\nearthworks in the present volume were written before the appearance of\r\nhis book, though the results arrived at are only slightly different.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter V. an effort is made to trace the first appearance of\r\nthe private castle in European history. The private castle is an\r\ninstitution which is often carelessly supposed to have existed from\r\ntime immemorial. The writer contends that it only appears after the\r\nestablishment of the feudal system.\r\n\r\nThe favourable reception given by archæologists to the paper read\r\nbefore the Scottish Society led the writer to follow up this\r\ninteresting subject, and to make a closer study of the motte-castles\r\nof Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. The book now offered is the fruit\r\nof eleven years of further research. The result of the inquiry is\r\nto establish the theory advanced in that earlier paper, that these\r\ncastles, in the British Islands, are in every case of Norman origin.\r\n\r\nThe writer does not claim to have originated this theory. Dr Round was\r\nthe first to attack (in the _Quarterly Review_, 1894) the assertion of\r\nthe late Mr G. T. Clark that the moated mound was a Saxon castle. Mr\r\nGeorge Neilson continued the same line of argument in his illuminating\r\npaper on \"The Motes in Norman Scotland\" (_Scottish Review_, vol.\r\nxxxii., 1898).[1] All that the writer claims is to have carried the\r\ncontention a stage further, and to have shown that the private castle\r\ndid not exist at all in Britain until it was brought here by the\r\nNormans.\r\n\r\nThe author feels that some apology is necessary for the enormous length\r\nof Chapter VII., containing the catalogue of Early English castles. It\r\nmay be urged in extenuation that much of the information it contains\r\nhas never before appeared in print, seeing that it has been taken from\r\nunpublished portions of the Pipe Rolls; further, that contemporary\r\nauthorities have in all cases been used, and that the chapter contains\r\na mass of material, previously scattered and almost inaccessible, which\r\nis here for the first time collated, and placed, as the author thinks,\r\nin its right setting. It is hoped that the chapter will prove a useful\r\nstorehouse to those who are working at the history of any particular\r\ncastle mentioned in the list.\r\n\r\nTo many it may seem a waste of labour to devote a whole book to the\r\nestablishment of a proposition which is now generally adopted by the\r\nbest English archæologists; but the subject is an important one, and\r\nthere is no book which deals with it in detail, and in the light of the\r\nevidence which has recently been accumulated. The writer hopes that\r\nsuch fuller statement of the case as is here attempted may help not\r\nonly to a right ascription of British castle-mounds, and of the stone\r\ncastles built upon many of them, but may also furnish material to the\r\nhistorian who seeks to trace the progress of the Norman occupation.\r\n\r\nStudents of the architecture of castles are aware that this subject\r\npresents much more difficult questions than does the architecture\r\nof churches. Those who are seriously working on castle architecture\r\nare very few in number, and are as yet little known to the world at\r\nlarge. From time to time, books on castles are issued from the press,\r\nwhich show that the writers have not even an idea of the preliminary\r\nstudies without which their work has no value at all. It is hoped that\r\nthe sketch of castle architecture from the 10th century to the 13th,\r\nwhich is given in the last chapter, may prove a useful contribution to\r\nthe subject, at any rate in its lists of dated castles. The Pipe Rolls\r\nhave been too little used hitherto for the general history of castle\r\narchitecture, and no list has ever been published before of the keeps\r\nbuilt by Henry II. But without the evidence of the Pipe Rolls we are\r\nin the land of guesswork, unsupported, as a rule, by the decorative\r\ndetails which render it easy to read the structural history of most\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nMy warmest thanks are due to Mr Duncan H. Montgomerie, F.S.A., for\r\nhis generous labour on the plans and illustrations of this book, and\r\nfor effective assistance in the course of the work, especially in\r\nmany toilsome pilgrimages for the purpose of comparing the Ordnance\r\nSurvey with the actual remains. I also owe grateful thanks to Mr\r\nGoddard H. Orpen, R.I.A., for most kindly revising the chapter on\r\nIrish mottes; to Mr W. St John Hope (late Assistant Secretary of the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries), for information on many difficult points;\r\nto Mr Harold Sands, F.S.A., whose readiness to lay his great stores\r\nof knowledge at my disposal has been always unfailing; to Mr George\r\nNeilson, F.S.A.Scot., for most valuable help towards my chapter on\r\nScottish mottes; to Mr Charles Dawson, F.S.A., for granting the use\r\nof his admirable photographs from the Bayeux Tapestry; to Mr Cooper,\r\nauthor of the _History of York Castle_, for important facts and\r\ndocuments relating to his subject; to the Rev. Herbert White, M.A.,\r\nand to Mr Basil Stallybrass, for reports of visits to castles; and to\r\ncorrespondents too numerous to mention who have kindly, and often very\r\nfully, answered my inquiries.\r\n\r\n                                                      ELLA S.

It may even be said\r\nthat during the first half of the 19th century, less attention was\r\npaid to earthworks than by our older topographical writers. Leland,\r\nin the reign of Henry VIII., never failed to notice the \"Dikes and\r\nHilles, which were Campes of Men of Warre,\" nor the \"Hilles of Yerth\r\ncast up like the Dungeon of sum olde Castelle,\" which he saw in his\r\npilgrimages through England. And many of our 17th- and 18th-century\r\ntopographers have left us invaluable notices of earthworks which were\r\nextant in their time. But if we turn over the archæological journals of\r\nsome fifty years ago, we shall be struck by the paucity of papers on\r\nearthworks, and especially by the complete ignoring, in most cases, of\r\nthose connected with castles.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune attending this neglect, was that it left the ground\r\nopen to individual fancy, and each observer formed his own theory of\r\nthe earthworks which he happened to have seen, and as often as not,\r\nstated that theory as a fact. We need not be surprised to find Camden\r\ndoing this, as he wrote before the dawn of scientific observation;\r\nbut that such methods should have been carried on until late in the\r\n19th century is little to the credit of English archæology. Mr Clark's\r\nwork on _Mediæval Military Architecture_ (published in 1884), which\r\nhas the merit of being one of the first to pay due attention to castle\r\nearthworks, counterbalances that merit by enunciating as a fact a mere\r\nguess of his own, which, as we shall afterwards show, was absolutely\r\ndevoid of solid foundation.\r\n\r\nThe scientific study of English earthworks may be said to have been\r\nbegun by General Pitt-Rivers in the last quarter of the 19th century;\r\nbut we must not forget that he described himself as a pupil of Canon\r\nGreenwell, whose careful investigations of British barrows form such\r\nan important chapter of prehistoric archæology. General Pitt-Rivers\r\napplied the lessons he had thus learned to the excavation of camps and\r\ndykes, and his labours opened a new era in that branch of research. By\r\naccumulating an immense body of observations, and by recording those\r\nobservations with a minuteness intended to forestall future questions,\r\nhe built up a storehouse of facts which will furnish materials to all\r\nfuture workers in prehistoric antiquities. He was too cautious ever to\r\ndogmatise, and if he arrived at conclusions, he was careful to state\r\nthem merely as suggestions. But his work destroyed many favourite\r\nantiquarian delusions, even some which had been cherished by very\r\nlearned writers, such as Dr Guest's theory of the \"Belgic ditches\" of\r\nWiltshire.\r\n\r\nA further important step in the study of earthworks was taken by the\r\nlate Mr I. Chalkley Gould, when he founded the Committee for Ancient\r\nEarthworks, and drew up the classification of earthworks which is now\r\nbeing generally adopted by archæological writers. This classification\r\nmay be abridged into (_a_) promontory or cliff forts, (_b_) hill forts,\r\n(_c_) rectangular forts, (_d_) moated hillocks, (_e_) moated hillocks\r\nwith courts attached, (_f_) banks and ditches surrounding homesteads,\r\n(_g_) manorial works, (_h_) fortified villages.\r\n\r\nWe venture to think that still further divisions are needed, to include\r\n(1) boundary earthworks; (2) sepulchral or religious circles or\r\nsquares; (3) enclosures clearly non-military, intended to protect sheep\r\nand cattle from wolves, or to aid in the capture of wild animals.[2]\r\n\r\nThis classification, it will be observed, makes no attempt to decide\r\nthe dates of the different types of earthworks enumerated. But a great\r\nstep forward was taken when these different types were separated\r\nfrom one another. There had been no greater source of confusion in\r\nthe writings of our older antiquaries, than the unscientific idea\r\nthat one earthwork was as good as another; that is to say, that one\r\ntype of earthwork would do as well as another for any date or any\r\ncircumstances. When it is recognised that large classes of earthworks\r\nshow similar features, it becomes probable that even if they were not\r\nthrown up in the same historic period, they were at any rate raised to\r\nmeet similar sets of circumstances. We may be quite sure that a camp\r\nwhich contains an area of 60 or 80 acres was not constructed for the\r\nsame purpose as one which only contains an area of three.\r\n\r\nWe are not concerned here, however, with the attempt to disentangle\r\nthe dates of the various classes of prehistoric earthworks.[3] Such\r\ngeneralisations are for the most part premature; and although some\r\nadvance is being made in this direction, it is still impossible to\r\ndecide without excavation whether a camp of class (_a_) or (_b_)\r\nbelongs to the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, or the Iron Age. Our business\r\nis with classes (_d_) and (_e_) of Mr Gould's list, that is, with the\r\nmoated hillocks. We shall only treat of the other classes to the extent\r\nwhich is necessary to bring out the special character of classes (_d_)\r\nand (_e_).\r\n\r\nLet us look more closely into these earthworks in their perfect form,\r\nthe class (_e_) of the Earthwork Committee's list. They consist, when\r\nfully preserved, of an artificial hillock, 20, 30, 40, or in some rare\r\ninstances 100 feet high. The hillock carried a breastwork of earth\r\nround the top, which in many cases is still preserved; this breastwork\r\nenclosed a small court, sometimes only 30 feet in diameter, in rare\r\ncases as large as half an acre; it must have been crowned by a stockade\r\nof timber, and the representations in the Bayeux Tapestry would lead\r\nus to think that it always enclosed a wooden tower.[4] As a rule the\r\nhillock is round, but it is not unfrequently oval, and occasionally\r\nsquare. The base of the hillock is surrounded by a ditch. Below the\r\nhillock is a court, much larger than the small space enclosed on the\r\ntop of the mount. It also has been surrounded by a ditch, which joins\r\nthe ditch of the mount, and thus encloses the whole fortification.\r\nThe court is defended by earthen banks, both on the scarp and\r\ncounterscarp of the ditch, and these banks of course had also their\r\ntimber stockades, the remains of which have sometimes been found on\r\nexcavation.[5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--TYPICAL MOTTE-CASTLES.\r\n\r\nTopcliffe, Yorks. Laughton-en-le-Morthen, Yorks. Anstey, Herts.\r\nDingestow, Monmouth. Hedingham, Essex.]\r\n\r\nThese are the main features of the earthworks in question. Some\r\nvariations may be noticed. The ditch is not invariably carried all\r\nround the hillock, occasionally it is not continued between the hillock\r\nand the court.[6] Sometimes the length of the ditch separating the\r\nhillock from the court is at a higher level than the main ditch.[7]\r\nOften the ditches were evidently dry from the first, but not\r\ninfrequently they are wet, and sometimes vestiges of the arrangements\r\nfor feeding them are still apparent. The hillock is not invariably\r\nartificial; often it is a natural hill scarped into a conical shape;\r\nsometimes an isolated rock is made use of to serve as a citadel, which\r\nsaved much spade-work. The shape of the court is very variable: it may\r\nbe square or oblong, with greatly rounded corners, or it may be oval,\r\nor semilunar, or triangular; a very common form is the bean-shaped.\r\nThe area covered by these fortifications is much more uniform; one of\r\nthe features contrasting them most strongly with the great prehistoric\r\n\"camps\" of southern England is their comparatively small size. We know\r\nof only one (Skipsea) in which the bailey covers as much as eight\r\nacres; in by far the greater number the whole area included in the\r\nhillock, court, and ditches does not exceed three acres, and often it\r\nis not more than one and a half.[8]\r\n\r\nNow this type of fort will tell us a good deal about itself if we\r\nexamine it carefully. In the first place, its character is more\r\npronounced than that of any other class of earthwork. It differs\r\nentirely from the great camps which belong to the tribal period. It\r\nwas evidently not designed to accommodate a mass of people with their\r\nflocks and herds. It is small in area, and its citadel, as a rule, is\r\nvery small indeed. Dr Sophus Müller, the eminent Danish archæologist,\r\nwhen dealing with the specimens of this class of fortification which\r\nare to be found in Denmark, made the luminous remark that \"the\r\nfortresses of prehistoric times are the defences of the _community_,\r\nnorth of the Alps as in the old classical lands. Small castles for\r\nan individual and his warrior-band belong to the Middle Ages.\"[9]\r\nThese words give the true direction to which we must turn for the\r\ninterpretation of these earthworks.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, this type presents a peculiar development of\r\nplan, such as we do not expect to find in the earliest times in these\r\nislands. It has a citadel of a most pronounced type. This alone\r\ndifferentiates it from the prehistoric or Keltic camps which are so\r\nabundant in Great Britain. It might be too hasty a generalisation\r\nto say that no prehistoric camps have citadels, but as a rule the\r\ntraverses by which some of these camps are divided appear to have\r\nbeen made for the purpose of separating the cattle from the people,\r\nrather than as ultimate retreats in time of war. The early German\r\ncamps, according to Köhler, have inner enclosures which he thinks\r\nwere intended for the residence of the chief; but he calls attention\r\nto the great difference between these camps and the class we are now\r\nconsidering, in that the inner enclosure is of much greater size.[10]\r\nIt would appear that some of the fortifications in England which are\r\nknown or suspected to be Saxon have also these inner enclosures of\r\nconsiderable size (6 acres in the case of Witham), but without any\r\nvestige of the hillock which is the principal feature of class (_e_).\r\n\r\nIt is clear, in the third place, that the man who threw up earthworks\r\nof this latter class was not only suspicious of his neighbours, but\r\nwas even suspicious of his own garrison. For the hillock in the great\r\nmajority of cases is so constructed as to be capable of complete\r\nisolation, and capable of defending itself, if necessary, against its\r\nown court. Thus it is probable that the force which followed this\r\nchieftain was not composed of men of his own blood, in whom he could\r\nrepose absolute trust; and the earthworks themselves suggest that they\r\nare the work of an invader who came to settle in these islands, who\r\nemployed mercenaries instead of tribesmen, and who had to maintain his\r\nsettlement by force.\r\n\r\nWhen on further inquiry we find that earthworks of this type are\r\nexceedingly common in France, and are generally found in connection\r\nwith feudal castles,[11] and when we consider the area of their\r\ndistribution in the United Kingdom, and see that they are to be found\r\nin every county in England, as well as in Wales and in the Normanised\r\nparts of Ireland and Scotland, we see that the Norman invader is the\r\none to whom they seem to point. We see also that small forts of this\r\nkind, easily and cheaply constructed, and defensible by a small number\r\nof men, exactly correspond to the needs of the Norman invader, both\r\nduring the period of the Conquest and for a long time after his first\r\nsettlement here.\r\n\r\nBut it will at once occur to an objector that there have been other\r\ninvaders of Britain before the Normans, and it may be asked why these\r\nearthworks were not equally suited to the needs of the Saxon or the\r\nDanish conquerors, and why they may not with equal reason be attributed\r\nto them. To answer this question we will try to discover what kind of\r\nfortifications actually were constructed by the Saxons and Danes, and\r\nto this inquiry we will address ourselves in the succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\nIt will clear the ground greatly if it is recognised at the outset\r\nthat these earthworks are _castles_, in the usual sense of the word;\r\nthat is, the private fortified residences of great landowners. It\r\nwas the chief merit of Mr G. T. Clark's work on _Mediæval Military\r\nArchitecture_, that he showed the perfect correspondence in plan of\r\nthese earthen and timber structures with the stone castles which\r\nimmediately succeeded them, so that it was only necessary to add a\r\nstone tower and stone walls to these works to convert them into a\r\nNorman castle of the popularly accepted type. We regard the military\r\ncharacter of these works as so fully established that we have not\r\nthought it necessary to discuss the theory that they were temples,\r\nwhich was suggested by some of our older writers, nor even the more\r\nmodern idea that they were moot-hills, which has been defended with\r\nconsiderable learning by Mr G. L. Gomme.[12] Dr Christison remarks\r\nin his valuable work on Scottish fortifications that an overweening\r\nimportance has been attached to moot-hills, without historical\r\nevidence.[13] And Mr George Neilson, in his essay on \"The Motes in\r\nNorman Scotland\"[14] (to which we shall often have occasion to refer\r\nhereafter), shows that moot-hill in Scotland means nothing but\r\nmote-hill, the hill of the mote or _motte_; but that _moots_ or courts\r\nwere held there, just because it had formerly been the site of a\r\ncastle, and consequently a seat of jurisdiction.[15]\r\n\r\nThat some of these hillocks have anciently been sepulchral, we do\r\nnot attempt to deny. The Norman seems to have been free from any\r\nsuperstitious fear which might have hindered him from utilising the\r\nsepulchres of the dead for his personal defence; or else he was\r\nunaware that they were burial-places. There are some very few recorded\r\ninstances of prehistoric burials found under the hillocks of castles;\r\nbut in ordinary cases, these hillocks would not be large enough for the\r\n_mottes_ of castles.[16] There are, however, some sepulchral barrows\r\nof such great size that it is difficult to distinguish them from\r\nmottes; the absence of a court attached is not sufficient evidence,\r\nas there are some mottes which stand alone, without any accompanying\r\ncourt. Excavation or documentary evidence can alone decide in these\r\ncases, though the presence of an earthen breastwork on top of the\r\nmount furnishes a strong presumption of a military origin. But the\r\nundoubtedly sepulchral barrows of New Grange and Dowth in Ireland show\r\nsigns of having been utilised as castles, having remains of breastworks\r\non their summits.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON FORTIFICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have pointed out in the preceding chapter that when it is asked\r\nwhether the earthworks of the moated mound-and-court type were the work\r\nof the Anglo-Saxons, the question resolves itself into another, namely,\r\nDid the Anglo-Saxons build castles?\r\n\r\nAs far as we know, they did not; and although to prove a negative we\r\ncan only bring negative evidence, that evidence appears to us to be\r\nvery conclusive. But before we deal with it, we will try to find out\r\nwhat sort of fortifications the Anglo-Saxons actually did construct.\r\n\r\nThe first fortification which we read of in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_\r\nis that of Bamborough, in Northumberland. The _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_\r\ntells us that in 547 Ida began to reign in Northumberland, and adds\r\nthat he built \"Bebbanburh,\" which was first enclosed with a hedge,\r\nand afterwards with a wall. Unfortunately this celebrated passage is\r\nmerely the interpolation of a 12th-century scribe, and is consequently\r\nof no authority whatever,[18] though there is nothing improbable in\r\nthe statement, and it is supported by Nennius.[19] Ida's grandson\r\nEthelfrith gave this fortress to his wife Bebba, from whom it received\r\nthe name of Bebbanburh, now Bamborough. It was built without doubt on\r\nthe same lofty insulated rock where the castle now stands; for when it\r\nwas attacked by Penda in 633, he found the situation so strong that\r\nit was impossible to storm it, and it was only by heaping up wood on\r\nthe most accessible side that he was able to set fire to the wooden\r\nstockade.[20] Modern historians talk of this fort as a castle, but all\r\nthe older authorities call it a town;[21] nor is there any mention\r\nof a castle at Bamborough till the reign of William II. The area of\r\nthe basaltic headland of Bamborough covers 4-3/4 acres, a site large\r\nenough for a city of Ida's day. The church of St Peter was placed on\r\nthe highest point. The castle which was built there in Norman times\r\ndoes not seem to have occupied at first more than a portion of this\r\nsite,[22] though it is probable that eventually the townsmen were\r\nexpelled from the rock, and that thus the modern town of Bamborough\r\narose in the levels below. Although 4-3/4 acres may seem a small size\r\nfor an _urbs_, it was certainly regarded as such, and was large enough\r\nto protect a considerable body of invaders.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, this is the only record which we have of any\r\nfortress-building by the invading Saxons. Until we come to the time\r\nof Alfred, there is hardly an allusion to any fortification in use in\r\nSaxon times.[23] It is mentioned in 571 that the Saxons took four\r\ntowns (_tunas_) of the Britons, and the apparent allusion to sieges\r\nseems to show that these British towns had some kind of fortification.\r\nThe three _chesters_, which were taken by the Saxons in 577,\r\nGloucester, Cirencester, and Bath, prove that some Roman cities still\r\nkept their defences. In 755 the slaughter of Cynewulf, king of the West\r\nSaxons, by the etheling Cyneard, is told with unusual detail by the\r\n_Chronicle_. The king was slain in a _bur_ (bower, or isolated women's\r\nchamber[24]), the door of which he attempted to defend; but this _bur_\r\nwas itself enclosed in a _burh_, the gates of which were locked by the\r\netheling who had killed the king, and were defended until they were\r\nforced by the king's avengers. Here it seems to be doubtful whether\r\nthe _burh_ was a town or a private enclosure resembling a stable-yard\r\nof modern times. The description of the storming of York by the Danes\r\nin 867 shows that the Roman walls of that city were still preserved.\r\nThese passages are the solitary instances of fortifications in England\r\nmentioned by the _Chronicle_ before the time of Alfred.[25] The\r\ninvasions of the Danes led at last to a great fortifying epoch, which\r\npreserved our country from being totally overwhelmed by those northern\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\nThe little Saxon kingdom of Wessex was the germ of the British Empire.\r\nWhen Alfred came to the throne it had already absorbed the neighbouring\r\nkingdoms of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey, and the issue hanging in the\r\nbalance was whether this small English state would survive the\r\ndesolating flood of pagan barbarism which had already overwhelmed the\r\nsister kingdoms of the Midlands and the North. It was given to Alfred\r\nto raise again the fallen standard of Christendom and civilisation, and\r\nto establish an English kingdom on so sound a basis that when, in later\r\ncenturies, it successively became the prey of the Dane and the Norman,\r\nthe English polity survived both conquests. The wisdom, energy, and\r\nsteadfastness of King Alfred and his children and grandchildren were\r\namongst the most important of the many factors which have helped to\r\nbuild up the great empire of Britain.\r\n\r\nWe are concerned here with only one of the measures by which Alfred and\r\nhis family secured the triumph of Wessex in her mortal struggle with\r\nthe Danes, the fortifications which they raised for the protection of\r\ntheir subjects. From the pages of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ we might\r\nbe led to think that Alfred's son and daughter, Edward and Ethelfleda,\r\nwere the chief builders of fortifications. But there is ample evidence\r\nthat they only carried out a systematic purpose which had been\r\ninitiated by Alfred. We know that Alfred was a great builder. \"What\r\nshall I say,\" cries Asser, \"of the cities and towns which he restored,\r\nand of others which he built which had never existed before! Of the\r\nroyal halls and chambers, wonderfully built of stone and wood by his\r\ncommand!\"[26] The _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ notices the restoration of\r\nLondon (886),[27] about which two extant charters are more precise.[28]\r\nIt also mentions the building of a work (geweorc) at Athelney, and\r\nanother at Limene-muthan (doubtless a repair of the Roman fort at\r\nLympne), and two works built by Alfred on the banks of the river\r\nLea.[29] William of Malmesbury tells us that in his boyhood there was\r\na stone in the nunnery of Shaftesbury which had been taken out of\r\nthe walls of the town, which bore this inscription: \"Anno dominicæ\r\nincarnationis Alfredus rex fecit hanc urbem, DCCCLXXX, regni sui\r\nVIII.\"[30] Ethelred, Alfred's son-in-law, built the _burh_ at Worcester\r\nin Alfred's lifetime, as a most interesting charter tells us.[31]\r\n\r\nIt may be safely assumed, then, that when Edward came to the throne\r\nhe found Wessex well provided with defensive places, and that when he\r\nand his sister signalised their conquests in the Midlands by building\r\nstrongholds at every fresh step of their advance, they were only\r\ncarrying out the policy of their father.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Alfred's death, and the succession of Edward the Elder\r\nto the crown (901), Ethelfleda, daughter of Alfred, was the wife of\r\nEthelred, ealdorman of Mercia, who appears to have been a sort of\r\nunder-king of that province.[32] On the death of Ethelred in 912,[33]\r\nEdward took possession of London and Oxford and \"of all the lands\r\nwhich owed obedience thereto\"--in other words, of that small portion\r\nof Eastern Mercia which was still in English hands; that is, not only\r\nthe present Oxfordshire and Middlesex, but part of Herts, part of\r\nBedfordshire, all Buckinghamshire, and the southern part of Northants.\r\nThe Watling Street, which runs north-west from London to Shrewsbury,\r\nand thence north to Chester and Manchester, formed at that time the\r\ndividing line between the English and Danish rule.[34] It would seem\r\nfrom the course of the story that after Ethelred's death there was some\r\narrangement between Ethelfleda and her brother, possibly due to the\r\nsurrender of the territory mentioned above, which enabled her to rule\r\nEnglish Mercia in greater independence than her husband had enjoyed. Up\r\nto this date we find Edward disposing of the _fyrd_ of Mercia;[35] this\r\nis not mentioned again in Ethelfleda's lifetime. Nothing is clearer,\r\nboth from the _Chronicle_ and from Florence, than that the brother and\r\nsister each \"did their own,\" to use an expressive provincial phrase.\r\nEthelfleda goes her own way, subduing Western Mercia, while Edward\r\npushes up through Eastern Mercia and Essex to complete the conquest of\r\nEast Anglia. A certain concert may be observed in their movements, but\r\nthey did not work in company.\r\n\r\nThe work of fortification begun in Alfred's reign had been continued by\r\nthe restoration of the Roman walls of Chester in 908, by Ethelred and\r\nhis wife; and Ethelfleda herself (possibly during the lingering illness\r\nwhich later chroniclers give to her husband) had built a _burh_ at\r\nBremesbyrig. During the twelve years which elapsed between Ethelred's\r\ndeath and that of Edward in 924, the brother and sister built no less\r\nthan twenty-seven _burhs_, giving a total of thirty, if we add Chester\r\nand Bremesbyrig, and Worcester, which was built in Alfred's reign. Now\r\nwhat was the nature of these fortifications, which the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_ uniformly calls _burhs_?\r\n\r\nThere is really not the slightest difficulty in answering this\r\nquestion. The word is with us still; it is our word _borough_. It is\r\ntrue we have altered the meaning somewhat, because a borough means\r\nnow an enfranchised town; but we must remember that it got that\r\nmeaning because the fortified towns, the only ones which were called\r\n_burhs_ or _burgi_, were the first to be enfranchised, and while the\r\nfortifications have become less and less important, the franchise has\r\nbecome of supreme importance.\r\n\r\nBede, in the earliest times of our history, equated _burh_ with _urbs_,\r\na city; Alfred in his _Orosius_ translates _civitas_ by _burh_;[36]\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon gospels of the 11th century do the same;[36] and\r\nthe confederacy of five Danish towns which existed in Mercia in the\r\n10th century is called in contemporary records _fif burga_, the five\r\nboroughs.[37]\r\n\r\n_Burh_ is a noun derived from the word _beorgan_, to protect.\r\nUndoubtedly its primitive meaning was that of a _protective enclosure_.\r\nAs in the case of the words _tun_, _yard_, or _garth_, and _worth_\r\nor _ward_, the sense of the word became extended from the protecting\r\nbulwark to the place protected. In this sense of a _fortified\r\nenclosure_, the word was naturally applied by the Anglo-Saxons to the\r\nprehistoric and British \"camps\" which they found in Britain, such as\r\nCissbury. Moreover, it is clear that some kind of enclosure must have\r\nexisted round every farmstead in Saxon times, if only as a protection\r\nagainst wolves. The illustrated Saxon manuscripts show that the hall\r\nin which the thane dwelt, the ladies' bower, the chapel and other\r\nbuildings dependent on the hall, were enclosed in a stockade, and had\r\ngates which without doubt were closed at night.[38] This enclosure may\r\nhave been called a _burh_, and the innumerable place-names in England\r\nending in _borough_ or _bury_[39] seem to suggest that the _burh_\r\nwas often nothing more than a stockade, as in so many of these sites\r\nnot a vestige of defensive works remains.[40] We may concede that\r\nthe original meaning of an _enclosure_ was never entirely lost, and\r\nthat it appears to be preserved in a few passages in the Anglo-Saxon\r\nlaws. Thus Edmund speaks of _mine burh_ as an asylum, the violation\r\nof which brings its special punishment; and Ethelred II. ordains that\r\nevery compurgation shall take place in _thaes kyninges byrig_; and the\r\n_Rectitudines Singularum Personum_ tells us that one of the duties of\r\nthe geneat was to build for his lord, and to hedge his _burh_.[41]\r\nBut it is absolutely clear that even in these cases a _burh_ was an\r\nenclosure and not a tump; and it is equally clear from the general use\r\nof the word that its main meaning was a _fortified town_. Athelstan\r\nordains that there shall be a mint in every _burh_; and his laws show\r\nthat already the _burh_ has its _gemot_ or meeting, and its _reeve_ or\r\nmayor.[42] He ordains that all _burhs_ are to be repaired fourteen\r\ndays after Rogations, and that no market shall be held outside the\r\ntown.[43] In the laws of Edgar's time not only the borough-moot and\r\nthe borough-reeve are spoken of, but the _burh-waru_ or burgesses.[44]\r\n_Burh_ is contrasted with wapentake as town with country.[45]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--ANGLO-SAXON MS. OF PRUDENTIUS.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to multiply proofs that a _burh_ was the same thing as\r\na borough, we can turn to the Anglo-Saxon illustrated manuscripts,\r\nand we shall find that they give us many pictures of _burhs_, and\r\nthat in all cases they are fortified towns.[46] Finally, Florence of\r\nWorcester, one of the most careful of our early chroniclers, who lived\r\nwhen Anglo-Saxon was still a living language, and who must have known\r\nwhat a _burh_ meant, translates it by _urbs_ in nineteen cases out\r\nof twenty-six.[47] His authority alone is sufficient to settle this\r\nquestion, and we need no longer have any doubt that a _burh_ was the\r\nsame thing which in mediæval Latin is called a _burgus_, that is a\r\nfortified town, and that our word _borough_ is lawfully descended from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been necessary to spend so much time on the history\r\nof the word _burh_ if this unfortunate word had not been made the\r\nsubject of one of the strangest delusions which ever was imposed on the\r\narchæological world. We refer of course to the theory of the late Mr G.\r\nT. Clark, who contended in his _Mediæval Military Architecture_[48]\r\nthat the moated mound of class (_e_), which we have described in our\r\nfirst chapter, was what the Anglo-Saxons called a _burh_. In other\r\nwords, he maintained that the burhs were Saxon castles. It is one\r\nof the most extraordinary and inexplicable things in the history of\r\nEnglish archæology that a man who was not in any sense an Anglo-Saxon\r\nscholar was allowed to affix an entirely new meaning to a very common\r\nAnglo-Saxon word, and that this meaning was at once accepted without\r\nquestion by historians who had made Anglo-Saxon history their special\r\nstudy! The present writer makes no pretensions to be an Anglo-Saxon\r\nscholar, but it is easy to pick out the word _burh_ in the _Chronicle_\r\nand the Anglo-Saxon _Laws_, and to find out how the word is translated\r\nin the Latin chronicles; and this little exercise is sufficient in\r\nitself to prove the futility of Mr Clark's contention.\r\n\r\nSentiment perhaps had something to do with Mr Clark's remarkable\r\nsuccess. There is an almost utter lack of tangible monuments of our\r\nnational heroes; and therefore people who justly esteemed the labours\r\nof Alfred and his house were pleased when they were told that the\r\nmounds at Tamworth, Warwick, and elsewhere were the work of Ethelfleda,\r\nand that other mounds were the work of Edward the Elder. It did not\r\noccur to them that they were doing a great wrong to the memory of the\r\nchildren of Alfred in supposing them capable of building these little\r\nearthen and timber castles for their personal defence and that of their\r\nnobles, and leaving the mass of their people at the mercy of the Danes.\r\nFar other was the thought of Ethelfleda, when she and her husband\r\nbuilt the borough of Worcester. As they expressed it in their memorable\r\ncharter, it was not only for the defence of the bishop and the churches\r\nof Worcester, but \"TO SHELTER ALL THE FOLK.\"[49] And we may be sure\r\nthat the same idea lay at the founding of all the boroughs which were\r\nbuilt by Alfred and by Edward and Ethelfleda. They were to be places\r\nwhere the whole countryside could take refuge during a Danish raid. The\r\n_Chronicle_ tells us in 894 how Alfred divided his forces into three\r\nparts, the duty of one part being to defend the boroughs; and from\r\nthis time forth we constantly find the men of the boroughs doing good\r\nservice against the Danes.[50] It was by defending and thus developing\r\nthe boroughs of England that Alfred and his descendants saved England\r\nfrom the Danes.\r\n\r\nThus far we have seen that all the fortifications which we know to have\r\nbeen built by the Anglo-Saxons were the fortifications of society and\r\nnot of the individual. We have heard nothing whatever of the private\r\ncastle as an institution in Saxon times; and although this evidence\r\nis only negative, it appears to us to be entitled to much more weight\r\nthan has hitherto been given to it. Some writers seem to think that the\r\nprivate castle was a modest little thing which was content to blush\r\nunseen. This is wholly to mistake the position of the private castle\r\nin history. Such a castle is not merely a social arrangement, it is a\r\npolitical institution of the highest importance. Where such castles\r\nexist, we are certain to hear of some of them, sooner or later, in the\r\npages of history.\r\n\r\nWe can easily test this by comparing Anglo-Saxon history with Norman\r\nof the same period, after castles had arisen in Normandy. Who among\r\nSaxon nobles was more likely to possess a castle than the powerful\r\nEarl Godwin, and his independent sons? Yet when Godwin left the court\r\nof Edward the Confessor, because he would not obey the king's order\r\nto punish the men of Dover for insulting Count Eustace of Boulogne,\r\nwe do not hear that he retired to his castle, or that his sons\r\nfortified their castles against the king; we only hear that they met\r\ntogether at Beverstone (a place where there was no castle before the\r\n14th century)[51] and \"arrayed themselves resolutely.\"[52] Neither\r\ndo we hear of any castle belonging to the powerful Earl Siward of\r\nNorthumbria, or Leofric, Earl of Mercia. And when Godwin returned\r\ntriumphantly to England in 1052 we do not hear of any castles being\r\nrestored to him.\r\n\r\nNow let us contrast this piece of English history, as told by the\r\n_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, with the Norman history of about the same\r\nperiod, the history of the rebellion of the Norman nobles against their\r\nyoung duke, William the Bastard. The first thing the nobles do is to\r\nput their castles into a state of defence. William has to take refuge\r\nin the castle of a faithful vassal, Hubert of Rye, until he can safely\r\nreach his own castle of Falaise. After the victory of Val-ès-Dunes,\r\nWilliam had to reduce the castles which still held out, and then to\r\norder the destruction of all the castles which had been erected against\r\nhim.[53]\r\n\r\nOr let us contrast the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ of 1051 with that of\r\n1088, when certain Norman barons and bishops in England conspired\r\nagainst the new king, William Rufus. The first thing told us is that\r\neach of the head conspirators \"went to his castle, and manned it and\r\nvictualled it.\" Then Bishop Geoffrey makes Bristol Castle the base of\r\na series of plundering raids. Bishop Wulfstan, on the other hand, aids\r\nthe cause of William by preventing an attempt of the rebels on the\r\ncastle of Worcester. Roger Bigod throws himself into Norwich Castle,\r\nand harries the shire; Bishop Odo brings the plunder of Kent into his\r\ncastle of Rochester. Finally the king's cause wins the day through the\r\ntaking of the castles of Tonbridge, Pevensey, Rochester, and Durham.\r\n\r\nIf we reflect on the contrast which these narratives afford, it surely\r\nis difficult to avoid the conclusion that if the chronicler never\r\nmentions any Saxon castles it is because there were no Saxon castles\r\nto mention. Had Earl Godwin possessed a stronghold in which he could\r\nfortify himself, he would certainly have used it in 1051. And as the\r\nNorman favourites of Edward the Confessor had already begun to build\r\ncastles in England, we can imagine no reason why Godwin did not do\r\nthe same, except that such a step was impossible to a man who desired\r\npopularity amongst his countrymen. The Welshmen, we are told (that is\r\nthe foreigners, the Normans), had erected a castle in Herefordshire\r\namong the people of Earl Sweyn, and had wrought all possible harm\r\nand disgrace to the king's men thereabout.[54] The language of the\r\n_Chronicle_ shows the unpopularity, to say the least of it, of this\r\ncastle-building; and one of the conditions which Godwin, when posing\r\nas popular champion, wished to exact from the king, was that the\r\n_Frenchmen who were in the castle_ should be given up to him.[55] When\r\nGodwin returned from his exile, and the Normans took to flight, the\r\nchronicler tells us that some fled west to Pentecost's castle, some\r\nnorth to Robert's castle. Thus we learn that there were several castles\r\nin England belonging to the Norman favourites.\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with these Norman favourites that the word _castel_\r\nappears for the first time in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_. This is a\r\nfact of considerable importance in itself; and when we weigh it in\r\nconnection with the expressions of dislike recorded above which become\r\nmuch more explicit and vehement after the Norman Conquest, we cannot\r\nbut feel that Mr Freeman's conclusion, that the thing as well as the\r\nword was new, is highly probable.[56] For the hall of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nealdorman or thane, even when enclosed in an earthwork or stockade,\r\nwas a very different thing from the castle of a Norman noble. A castle\r\nis built by a man who lives among enemies, who distrusts his nearest\r\nneighbours as much as any foe from a distance. The Anglo-Saxon noble\r\nhad no reason to distrust his neighbours, or to fortify himself against\r\nthem. Later historians, who were familiar with the state of things in\r\nNorman times, tell us frequently of castles in the Saxon period; but\r\nit can generally be proved that they misunderstood their authorities.\r\nThe genuine contemporary chroniclers of Saxon times never make the\r\nslightest allusion to a Saxon castle.\r\n\r\nThe word _castellum_, it is true, appears occasionally in Anglo-Saxon\r\ncharters, but when it is used it clearly means a town. Thus Egbert of\r\nKent says in 765: \"Trado terram intra castelli moenia supranominati,\r\nid est Hrofescestri, unum viculum cum duobus jugeribus, etc.,\" where\r\n_castellum_ is evidently the city of Rochester.[57] Offa calls\r\nWermund \"episcopus castelli quod nominatur Hroffeceastre.\"[58] These\r\ninstances can easily be multiplied. Mr W. H. Stevenson remarks that \"in\r\nOld-English glosses, from the 8th century Corpus Glossary downwards,\r\n_castellum_ is glossed by _wic_, that is town.\"[59] In this sense no\r\ndoubt we must interpret Asser's \"castellum quod dicitur Werham.\"[60]\r\nHenry of Huntingdon probably meant a town when he says that Edward the\r\nElder built at Hertford \"castrum non immensum sed pulcherrimum.\" He\r\ngenerally translates the _burh_ of the _Chronicle_ by _burgus_, and he\r\nshows that he had a correct idea of Edward's work when he says that\r\nat Buckingham Edward \"fecit _vallum_ ex utraque parte aquæ\"--where\r\n_vallum_ is a translation of _burh_. The difference between a _burh_\r\nand a castle is very clearly expressed by the _Chronicle_ in 1092,\r\nwhen it says concerning the restoration of Carlisle on its conquest by\r\nWilliam Rufus, \"He repaired the borough (burh) and ordered the castle\r\nto be built.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a table of the thirty boroughs built by Ethelfleda and\r\nEdward, arranged chronologically, which will show that we never find a\r\n_motte_, that is a moated mound, on the site of one of these boroughs\r\nunless a Norman castle-builder has been at work there subsequently. The\r\nweak point in Mr Clark's argument was that when he found a motte on a\r\nsite which had once been Saxon, he did not stop to inquire what any\r\nsubsequent builders might have done there, but at once assumed that the\r\nmotte was Saxon. Of course, if we invariably found a motte at _every_\r\nplace where Edward or Ethelfleda are said to have built a _burh_, it\r\nwould raise a strong presumption that mottes and burhs were the same\r\nthing. But out of the twenty-five burhs which can be identified, in\r\nonly ten is there a motte on the same site; and in every case where a\r\nmotte is found, except at Bakewell and Towcester, there is recorded\r\nproof of the existence of a Norman castle. In this list, the _burhs_\r\non both sides of the river at Hertford, Buckingham, and Nottingham\r\nare counted as two, because the very precise indications given in\r\nthe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ show that each _burh_ was a separate\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Burhs of Ethelfleda._\r\n\r\n Worcester             873-899  A motte and a Norman castle.\r\n Chester                   908  A motte and a Norman castle.\r\n Bremesburh                911  Unidentified.\r\n Scærgate                  913  Unidentified.\r\n Bridgenorth               913  No motte, but a Norman stone keep.\r\n Tamworth                  914  A motte and a Norman castle.\r\n Stafford, N. of Sowe      914  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Eddisbury                 915  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Warwick                   915  A motte and a Norman castle.\r\n Cyricbyrig (Monk's Kirby) 916  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Weardbyrig                916  Unidentified.\r\n Runcorn                   916  No motte; a mediæval castle (?).\r\n\r\n\r\n _Burhs of Edward the Elder._\r\n\r\n Hertford, N. of Lea       913  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Hertford, S. of Lea       913  A motte and a Norman castle.\r\n Witham                    914  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Buckingham, S. of Ouse    915  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Buckingham, N. of Ouse    915  A motte and a Norman castle.\r\n Bedford, S. of Ouse       916  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Maldon                    917  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Towcester                 918  A motte.\r\n Wigingamere               918  Unidentified.\r\n Huntingdon                918  A motte and a Norman castle.\r\n Colchester                918  No motte; an early Norman keep.\r\n Cledemuthan               918  Unidentified.\r\n Stamford, S. of Welland   919  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Nottingham, N. of Trent   919  A motte and a Norman castle.\r\n Thelwall                  920  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Manchester                920  No castle on the ancient site.\r\n Nottingham, S. of Trent   921  No motte and no Norman castle.\r\n Bakewell (near to)        921  A motte and bailey.\r\n\r\nOut of this list of the _burhs_ of Ethelfleda and Edward, thirteen\r\nare mentioned as boroughs in Domesday Book;[61] and as we ought to\r\nsubtract five from the list as unidentified, and also to reckon as\r\none the boroughs built on two sides of the river, the whole number\r\nshould be reduced to twenty-two. So that more than half the boroughs\r\nbuilt by the children of Alfred continued to maintain their existence\r\nduring the succeeding centuries, and in fact until the present day.\r\nBut the others, for some reason or other, did not take root. Professor\r\nMaitland remarked that many of the boroughs of Edward's day became\r\nrotten boroughs before they were ripe;[62] and it is a proof of the\r\ndifficulty of the task which the royal brethren undertook that, with\r\nthe exception of Chester, none of the boroughs which they built in the\r\nnorth-western districts survived till Domesday. In all their boroughs,\r\nexcept Bakewell, the purpose of defending the great Roman roads and the\r\nmain waterways is very apparent.\r\n\r\nOur list is very far from being a complete list of all the Anglo-Saxon\r\nboroughs existing in Edward's day. In the document known as the\r\n\"Burghal Hidage\" we have another quite different list of thirty-two\r\nboroughs,[63] which, according to Professor Maitland, \"sets forth\r\ncertain arrangements made early in the 10th century for the defence\r\nof Wessex against the Danish inroads.\"[64] Five at least on the list\r\nare Roman chesters; twenty are mentioned as boroughs in Domesday\r\nBook. There are two among them which are of special interest, because\r\nthere is reason to believe that the earthen ramparts which still\r\nsurround them are of Saxon origin: Wallingford and Wareham. Both these\r\nfortifications are after the Roman pattern, the earthen banks forming a\r\nsquare with rounded corners.[65] See Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nTo complete our knowledge of Anglo-Saxon fortification, we ought\r\nto examine the places mentioned in Anglo-Saxon charters as royal\r\nseats, where possibly defensive works of some kind may have existed.\r\nUnfortunately we are unable to learn that there are any such works,\r\nexcept at one place, Bensington in Oxfordshire, where about a hundred\r\nyears ago \"a bank and trench, which seem to have been of a square\r\nform,\" were to be seen.[66]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:FIG. 3. Wallingford, Berks. Wareham, Dorset.]\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter we shall deal in detail with such archæological\r\nremains as still exist of the boroughs of Edward and Ethelfleda, but\r\nhere we will briefly summarise by anticipation the results to which\r\nthat chapter will lead. We see that sites defensible by nature were\r\noften seized upon for fortification, as at Bamborough, Bridgenorth, and\r\nEddisbury; but that this was by no means always the case, as a weak\r\nsite, such as Witham, for example, was sometimes rendered defensible by\r\nworks which appear to have fulfilled their purpose. In only one case\r\n(Witham) do we find an inner enclosure; and as it is of large size\r\n(9-1/2 acres) it is more probable that the outer enclosure was for\r\ncattle, than that the inner one was designed solely for the protection\r\nof the king and his court. We are not told of stone walls more than\r\nonce (at Towcester); but the use of the word _timbrian_, which does\r\nnot exclusively mean to build in wood,[67] does not preclude walls of\r\nstone in important places. In the square or oblong form, with rounded\r\ncorners, we see the influence which Roman models exercised on eyes\r\nwhich still beheld them existing.\r\n\r\nWe see that the main idea of the borough was the same as that of the\r\nprehistoric or British \"camp of refuge,\" in that it was intended for\r\nthe defence of society and not of the individual. It was intended to be\r\na place of refuge for the whole countryside. But it was also something\r\nmuch more than this, something which belongs to a much more advanced\r\nstate of society than the hill-fort.[68] It was a town, a place where\r\npeople were expected to live permanently and do their daily work. It\r\nprovided a fostering seat for trade and manufactures, two of the chief\r\nfactors in the history of civilisation. The men who kept watch and\r\nward on the ramparts, or who sallied forth in their bands to fight the\r\nDanes, were the men who were slowly building up the prosperity of the\r\nstricken land of England. By studding the great highways of England\r\nwith fortified towns, Alfred and his children were not only saving the\r\nkernel of the British Empire, they were laying the sure foundations of\r\nits future progress in the arts and habits of civilised life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON FORTIFICATIONS--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bare list which we have given of the boroughs of Edward and\r\nEthelfleda calls for some explanatory remarks. Let us take first the\r\nboroughs of Ethelfleda.\r\n\r\nWORCESTER.--We have already noticed the charter of Ethelred and\r\nEthelfleda which tells of the building of the burh at Worcester.[69]\r\nThere appears to have been a small Roman settlement at Worcester, but\r\nthere is no evidence that it was a fortified place.[70] This case lends\r\nsome support to the conjecture of Dr Christison, that the Saxons gave\r\nthe name of _chester_ to towns which they had themselves fortified.[71]\r\nThe mediæval walls of Worcester were probably more extensive than\r\nEthelfleda's borough, of which no trace remains.\r\n\r\nCHESTER is spoken of by the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ in 894 as \"a\r\nwaste _chester_ in Wirral.\" It had undoubtedly been a Roman city, and\r\ntherefore the work of Ethelred and Ethelfleda here was solely one of\r\nrestoration. Brompton, who wrote at the close of the 13th century \"a\r\npoor compilation of little authority,\"[72] was the first writer to\r\nstate that the walls of Chester were enlarged by Ethelfleda so as\r\nto take in the castle, which he fancied to be Roman;[73] and this\r\nstatement, being repeated by Leland, has acquired considerable vogue.\r\nIt is very unlikely that any extension of the walls was made by the\r\nMercian pair, seeing that the city was deserted at the time when it\r\nwas occupied by the Danes, only fourteen years before. But it is quite\r\ncertain that the Norman castle of Chester lay outside the city walls,\r\nas the manor of Gloverstone, which was not within the jurisdiction of\r\nthe city, lay between the city and the castle.[74] A charter of Henry\r\nVII. shows that the civic boundary did not extend to the present south\r\nwall in his reign. Ethelfleda's borough probably followed the lines of\r\nthe old Roman castrum.\r\n\r\nBREMESBYRIG.--This place has not yet been identified. Bromborough on\r\nthe Mersey has been suggested, and is not impossible, for the loss of\r\nthe _s_ sometimes occurs in place-names; thus Melbury, in Wilts, was\r\nMelsburie in Domesday. Bremesbyrig was the first place restored after\r\nChester, and as the estuary of the Dee had been secured by the repair\r\nof Chester, so an advance on Bromborough would have for its aim to\r\nsecure the estuary of the Mersey. It was outside the Danish frontier\r\nof Watling Street, and could thus be fortified without breach of the\r\npeace in 911. There is a large moated work at Bromborough, enclosing an\r\narea of 10 acres, in the midst of which stands the courthouse of the\r\nmanor of Bromborough. But this manor was given by the Earl of Chester\r\nto the monks of St Werburgh about 1152, and it is possible that the\r\nmonks fortified it, as they did their manor of Irby in Wirral, against\r\nthe incursions of the Welsh. One of the conditions of the Earl's\r\ngrant was that the manor is to be maintained in a state of security\r\nand convenience for the holding of the courts appertaining to Chester\r\nAbbey.[75] Thus the fortification appears to be of manorial use, though\r\nthis does not preclude the possibility of an earlier origin. On the\r\nother hand, if Bromborough is the same as Brunanburh, where Athelstan's\r\ngreat battle was fought (and there is much in favour of this), it\r\ncannot possibly have been Bremesbyrig in the days of Edward. Another\r\nsite has been suggested by the Rev. C. S. Taylor, in a paper on _The\r\nDanes in Gloucestershire_, Bromsberrow in S. Gloucestershire, one of\r\nthe last spurs of the Malvern Hills. Here the top of a small hill has\r\nbeen encircled with a ditch; but the ditch is so narrow that it does\r\nnot suggest a defensive work, and it is remote from any Roman road or\r\nnavigable river.\r\n\r\nSCERGEAT has not yet been identified. Mr Kerslake argued with some\r\nprobability that Shrewsbury is the place;[76] but the etymological\r\nconsiderations are adverse, and it is more likely that such an\r\nimportant place as Shrewsbury was fortified before Edward's time.\r\nLeland calls it Scorgate, and says it is \"about Severn side.\"[77] It\r\nshould probably be sought within the frontier of Watling Street, which\r\nEthelfleda does not appear to have yet crossed in 911.\r\n\r\nBRIDGENORTH is undoubtedly the Bricge of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_,\r\nas Florence of Worcester identifies it with the Bridgenorth which\r\nRobert Belesme fortified against Henry I. in 1101.[78] Bridgenorth\r\nis on a natural fortification of steep rock, which would only require\r\na stout wall to make it secure against all the military resources of\r\nthe 10th century. We may therefore be quite certain that it was here\r\nEthelfleda planted her borough, and not (as Mr Eyton unfortunately\r\nconjectured) on the mound outside the city, in the parish of\r\nOldbury.[79] This mound was far more probably the site of the siege\r\ncastle (no doubt of wood) which was erected by Henry I. when he\r\nbesieged the city.[80]\r\n\r\nTAMWORTH was an ancient city of the Mercian kings, and therefore may\r\nhave been fortified before its walls were rebuilt by Ethelfleda.[81]\r\nThe line of the ancient town-wall can still be traced in parts, though\r\nit is rapidly disappearing. Dugdale says the town ditch was 45 feet\r\nbroad. Tamworth was a borough at the time of Domesday.\r\n\r\nSTAFFORD has a motte on which stood a Norman castle; but this is not\r\nmentioned in the table, because it stands a mile and a half from the\r\ntown on the _southern_ side of the river Sowe, while we are expressly\r\ntold by Florence that Ethelfleda's borough was on the _northern_ side,\r\nas the town is now. Stafford was a Domesday borough; some parts of\r\nthe mediæval walls still remain. The walls are mentioned in Domesday\r\nBook.[82]\r\n\r\nEDDISBURY, in Cheshire (Fig. 4), is the only case in which the work\r\nof Ethelfleda is preserved in a practically unaltered form, as no\r\ntown or village has ever grown out of it. The _burh_ stands at the\r\ntop of a hill, commanding the junction of two great Roman roads, the\r\nWatling Street from Chester to Manchester, and the branch which it\r\nsends forth to Kinderton on the east. As a very misleading plan of this\r\nwork has been published in the _Journal of the British Archæological\r\nAssociation_ for 1906, the _burh_ has been specially surveyed for this\r\nbook by Mr D. H. Montgomerie, who has also furnished the following\r\ndescription:--\r\n\r\n\"This plan is approximately oval, and is governed by the shape of\r\nthe ground; the work lies at the end of a spur, running S.E. and\r\nterminating in abrupt slopes to the E. and S. The defences on the N.\r\nand W. consist of a ditch and a high outer bank, the proportions of\r\nthese varying according to the slope of the hill. There are slight\r\nremains of a light inner rampart along the western half of this side.\r\nThe remains of an original entrance (shown in Ormerod's _Cheshire_)\r\nare visible in the middle of the N.W. side, beyond which the ditch and\r\nouter bank have been partially levelled by the encroachments of the\r\nfarm buildings. The defences of the S. side seem to have consisted of\r\na long natural slope, crowned by a steeper scarp, cut back into the\r\nrock, and having traces of a bank along its crest. The S.E. end of the\r\nspur presents several interesting details, for it has been occupied\r\nin mediæval times by a small fortified enclosure, whose defences are\r\napt to be confused with those of the older Saxon town. The rock makes\r\na triangular projection at this end, containing the foundations of\r\nmediæval buildings,[83] and strengthened on the N.E. by a slight\r\nditch some 7 to 10 feet below the crest; the rock on the inner side\r\nof this ditch has been cut back to a nearly vertical face, while on\r\nthe outer bank are the footings of a masonry wall extending almost to\r\nthe point of the spur. There are traces of another wall defending the\r\ncrest on the N.E. and S.; but the base of the triangle, facing the old\r\nenclosure, does not appear to have been strengthened by a cross ditch\r\nor bank.\r\n\r\n\"It may be noted that this enclosure presents not the slightest\r\nappearance of a motte. It is at a lower level than the body of the\r\nhill, and belongs most certainly to the Edwardian period of the masonry\r\nbuildings.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Eddisbury, Cheshire. Witham, Essex.]\r\n\r\nWARWICK Castle has a motte which has been confidently attributed to\r\nEthelfleda, only because Dugdale copied the assertion of Thomas Rous, a\r\nvery imaginative writer of the 15th century, that she was its builder.\r\nThe borough which Ethelfleda fortified probably occupied a smaller area\r\nthan the mediæval walls built in Edward I.'s reign; and it is probable\r\nthat it did not include the site of the castle, as Domesday states\r\nthat only four houses were destroyed when the castle was built.[84]\r\nThe borough was doubtless erected to protect the Roman road from Bath\r\nto Lincoln, the Foss Way, which passes near it. Domesday Book, after\r\nmentioning that the king's barons have 112 houses in the borough, and\r\nthe abbot of Coventry 36, goes on to say that these houses belong to\r\nthe lands which the barons hold outside the city, and are rated\r\nthere.[85] This is one of the passages from which the late Professor\r\nMaitland concluded that the boroughs planted by Ethelfleda and Edward\r\nwere organised on a system of military defence, whereby the magnates in\r\nthe country were bound to keep houses in the towns.[86]\r\n\r\nCYRICBYRIG.--About this place we adopt the conjecture of Dugdale, who\r\nidentified it with Monk's Kirby in Warwickshire, not far from the\r\nborders of Leicestershire, and therefore on the edge of Ethelfleda's\r\ndominions. It lies close to the Foss Way, and about three miles from\r\nWatling Street; like Eddisbury, it is near the junction of two Roman\r\nroads. There are remains of banks and ditches below the church.\r\nDugdale says \"there are certain apparent tokens that the Romans had\r\nsome station here; for by digging the ground near the church, there\r\nhave been discovered foundations of old walls and Roman bricks.\"[87]\r\nPossibly Ethelfleda restored a Roman castrum here. At any rate, it\r\nseems a much more likely site than Chirbury in Shropshire, which is\r\ncommonly proposed, but which does not lie on any Roman road, and is not\r\non Ethelfleda's line of advance; nor are there any earthworks there.\r\n\r\nWEARDBYRIG has not been identified. Wednesbury was stated by Camden\r\nto be the place,[88] and but for the impossibility of the etymology,\r\nthe situation would suit well enough. Weardbyrig must have been an\r\nimportant place, for it had a mint.[89] Warburton, on the Mersey, has\r\nbeen gravely suggested, but is impossible, as it takes its name from St\r\nWerburgh.\r\n\r\nRUNCORN has not a vestige to show of Ethelfleda's borough; but local\r\nhistorians have preserved some rather vague accounts of a promontory\r\nfort which once existed at the point where the London and North-Western\r\nRailway bridge enters the river. A rocky headland formerly projected\r\nhere into the Mersey, narrowing its course to 400 yards at high water;\r\na ditch with a circular curve cut off this headland from the shore.\r\nThis ditch, from 12 to 16 feet wide, with an inner bank 6 or 7 feet\r\nhigh, could still be traced in the early part of the 19th century.\r\nEighteen feet of the headland were cut off when the Duke of Bridgewater\r\nmade his canal in 1773, and the ditch was obliterated when the railway\r\nbridge was built. From the measurements which have been preserved, the\r\narea of this fort must have been very small, not exceeding 3 acres at\r\nthe outside;[90] and it is unlikely that it represented Ethelfleda's\r\nborough, as the church, which was of pre-Conquest foundation, stood\r\noutside its bounds, and we should certainly have expected to find it\r\nwithin. As the Norman earls of Chester established a ferry at Runcorn\r\nin the 12th century, and as a castle at Runcorn is spoken of in a\r\nmediæval document,[91] it seems not impossible that there may have\r\nbeen a Norman castle on this site, as we constantly find such small\r\nfortifications placed to defend a ferry or ford. It is probable that\r\nEthelfleda's borough was destroyed at an early period by the Northmen,\r\nfor Runcorn was not a borough at Domesday, but was then a mere\r\ndependency of the Honour of Halton.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Burhs of Edward the Elder._\r\n\r\nHERTFORD.--Two burhs were built by Edward at Hertford in 913, one on\r\nthe north and the other on the south side of the river Lea. Therefore\r\nif a burh were the same thing as a motte, there ought to be two mottes\r\nat Hertford, one on each side of the river; whereas there is only one,\r\nand that forms part of the works of the Norman castle. Mr Clark, with\r\nhis usual confidence, says that the northern mound has \"long been laid\r\nlow\";[92] but there is not the slightest proof that it ever existed\r\nexcept in his imagination. Hertford was a borough at the time of\r\nDomesday. No earthworks remain.\r\n\r\nWITHAM (Fig. 4).--There are some remains of a _burh_ here which are\r\nvery remarkable, as they show an inner enclosure within the outer one.\r\nThey have been carefully surveyed by Mr F. C. J. Spurrell, who has\r\npublished a plan of them.[93] Each enclosure formed roughly a square\r\nwith much-rounded corners. The ditch round the outer work was 30 feet\r\nwide; the inner work was not ditched. The area enclosed by the outer\r\nbank was 26-1/4 acres, an enclosure much too large for a castle; the\r\narea of the inner enclosure was 9-1/2 acres. As far as is at present\r\nknown, Witham is the only instance we have of an Anglo-Saxon earthwork\r\nwhich has a double enclosure.[94] Witham is not mentioned as a borough\r\nin Domesday Book, but the fact that it had a mint in the days of\r\nHardicanute shows that it maintained its borough rights for more than\r\na hundred years. The name Chipping Hill points to a market within the\r\nborough.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM is another case where a _burh_ was built on both sides of\r\nthe river, and as at Hertford, there was only one motte, site of the\r\ncastle of the Norman Giffards, now almost obliterated. The river Ouse\r\nhere makes a long narrow loop to the south-west, within which stands\r\nthe town, and, without doubt, this would be the site of Edward's\r\nborough. No trace is left of the second borough on the other side of\r\nthe river. Buckingham is one of the boroughs of Domesday.\r\n\r\nBEDFORD has had a motte and a Norman castle on the north side of\r\nthe Ouse; but this was not the site of Edward's borough, which the\r\n_Chronicle_ tells us was placed on the south side of that river. On the\r\nsouth side an ancient ditch, 10 or 12 feet broad, with some traces of\r\nan inner rampart, semicircular in plan, but with a square extension,\r\nis still visible, and fills with water at flood times.[95] This is\r\nvery likely to be the ditch of Edward's borough. Both at Bedford and\r\nBuckingham the _Chronicle_ states that Edward spent four weeks in\r\nbuilding the _burh_. Mediæval numbers must never be taken as precise;\r\nbut the disproportion between four weeks and eight days, the space\r\noften given for the building of an early Norman castle, corresponds\r\nvery well to the difference between the time needed to throw up the\r\nbank and stockade of a town, and that needed for the building of an\r\nearthen and wooden castle.\r\n\r\nMALDON.--Only one angle of the earthen bank of Edward's borough remains\r\nnow, but Gough states that it was an oblong camp enclosing about 22\r\nacres.[96] It had rounded corners and a very wide ditch, with a bank on\r\nboth scarp and counterscarp. Maldon was a borough at Domesday;[97] the\r\nking had a hall there, but there was never any castle, nor is there any\r\ntrace of a motte.\r\n\r\nTOWCESTER (Fig. 5).--There is a motte at Towcester, but no direct\r\nevidence has yet been found for the existence of a Norman castle there,\r\nthough Leland says that he was told of \"certen Ruines or Diches of a\r\nCastelle.\"[98] There was a mill and an oven to which the citizens owed\r\nsoke,[99] and the value of the manor, which belonged to the king, had\r\nrisen very greatly since the Conquest;[100] all facts which render\r\nthe existence of a Norman castle extremely likely. But there can be\r\nno question as to the nature of Edward's work at Towcester, as the\r\n_Chronicle_ tells us expressly that \"he wrought the burgh at Towcester\r\nwith a stone wall.\"[101] Towcester lies on Watling Street, and is\r\nbelieved to have been the Roman station of Lactodorum. Baker gives a\r\nplan of the remains existing in his time, which may either be those of\r\nthe Roman castrum or of Edward's borough.[102] The area is stated to be\r\nabout 35 acres.\r\n\r\nWIGINGAMERE.--This place is not yet identified, for the identification\r\nwith Wigmore in Herefordshire, though accepted by many respectable\r\nwriters, will not stand a moment's examination. Wigmore was entirely\r\nout of Edward's beat, and he had far too much on his hands in 918 to\r\nattempt a campaign in Herefordshire. As Wigingamere appears to have\r\nspecially drawn upon itself the wrath of East Anglian and Essex Danes,\r\nit must have lain somewhere in their neighbourhood. The _mere_ which\r\nis included in the name would seem to point to that great inland water\r\nwhich anciently stretched southwards from the Wash into Cambridgeshire.\r\nThe only approach to East Anglia from the south lay along a strip of\r\nopen chalk land which lay between the great swamp and the dense forests\r\nwhich grew east of it.[103] Here ran the ancient road called the\r\nIcknield way. On a peninsula which now runs out into the great fens of\r\nthe Cam and the Ouse there is still a village called Wicken, 6 miles\r\nwest of the Roman road; and possibly, when the land surrounding this\r\npeninsula was under water, this bight may have been called Wigingamere.\r\nThis suggestion of course is merely tentative, but what gives it some\r\nprobability is that the Danish army which attacked \"the borough at\r\nWigingamere\" came from East Anglia as well as Mercia.[104]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--PLAN OF TOWCESTER ABOUT 1830.]\r\n\r\nHUNTINGDON.--The borough of Huntingdon was probably first built by the\r\nDanes, as it was only repaired by Edward. In Leland's time there were\r\nstill some remains of the walls \"in places.\" Huntingdon is one of the\r\n_burgi_ of Domesday.\r\n\r\nCOLCHESTER.--This of course was a Roman site, and Edward needed only\r\nto restore the walls, as the _Chronicle_ indicates. Colchester\r\nwas placed so as to defend the river Colne, just as Maldon defended\r\nthe estuary of the Blackwater. As the repair of Colchester and the\r\nsuccessful defence of Wigingamere were followed the same year by the\r\nsubmission of East Anglia, it seems not unlikely that Edward's various\r\nforces may have made a simultaneous advance, along the coast, and\r\nalong the Roman road by the Fen country; but this of course is the\r\nmerest conjecture, as the _Chronicle_ gives us no details of this very\r\nimportant event.\r\n\r\nCLEDEMUTHAN.--This place is only mentioned in the Abingdon MS. of the\r\n_Chronicle_, but the year 921 is the date given for its building.\r\nThis date should probably be transposed to 918, the year in which,\r\naccording to Florence, Edward subjugated East Anglia. It is well known\r\nhow confused the chronology of the various versions of the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_ is during the reign of Edward the Elder.[105] Cley, in\r\nNorfolk, would be etymologically deducible from Clede (the _d_ being\r\nfrequently dropped, especially in Scandinavian districts), and the\r\n_muthan_ points to some river estuary. Cley is one of the few havens\r\non the north coast of Norfolk, and its importance in former times was\r\nmuch greater than now, as is shown not only by the spaciousness of its\r\nEarly English church, but by the fact that the port has jurisdiction\r\nfor 30 miles along the coast.[106] It would be highly probable that\r\nEdward completed the subjugation of East Anglia by planting a borough\r\nat some important point. But as the real date of the fortification of\r\nCledemuthan is uncertain, we must be content to leave this matter in\r\nabeyance.[107]\r\n\r\nSTAMFORD is another case where the _borough_ is clearly said to have\r\nbeen on the side which is opposite to the one where the Norman castle\r\nstands. Edward's borough was on the south side, the motte and other\r\nremains of the Norman castle are on the north of the Welland. It is\r\nremarkable that the part of Stamford on the south side of the Welland\r\nis still a distinct liberty; it is mentioned in Domesday as the sixth\r\nward of the borough. The line of the earthworks can still be traced in\r\nparts. The borough on the north side of the Welland was probably first\r\nwalled in by the Danes, as it was one of the Five Boroughs--Stamford,\r\nLeicester, Lincoln, Nottingham, and Derby--which appear to have formed\r\nan independent or semi-independent state in middle England.[108]\r\nStamford is a borough in Domesday.\r\n\r\nNOTTINGHAM.--The first mention of a fortress in connection with\r\nNottingham seems to suggest that it owed its origin to the Danes. In\r\n868 the Danish host which had taken possession of York in the previous\r\nyear \"went into Mercia to Nottingham, and there took up their winter\r\nquarters. And Burgræd king of Mercia and his Witan begged of Ethelred,\r\nking of the West Saxons, and of Alfred his brother, that they would\r\nhelp them, that they might fight against the army. And then they went\r\nwith the West Saxon force into Mercia as far as Nottingham, and there\r\nencountered the army which was in the fortress (geweorc), and besieged\r\nthem there; but there was no great battle fought, and the Mercians made\r\npeace with the army.\"[109] Nottingham became another of the Danish\r\nFive Boroughs. The Danish host on this occasion came from York, no\r\ndoubt in ships down the Ouse and up the Trent. The site would exactly\r\nsuit them, as it occupied a very strong position on St Mary's Hill, a\r\nheight equal to that on which the castle stands, defended on the south\r\nfront by precipitous cliffs, below which ran the river Leen, and only a\r\nvery short distance from the junction of the Leen with the Trent, the\r\ngreat waterway of middle England.[110] Portions of the ancient ditch\r\nwere uncovered in 1890, and its outline appears to have been roughly\r\nrectangular, like the Danish camp at Shoebury. The ditch was about 20\r\nfeet wide. The area enclosed was about 39 acres.\r\n\r\nThis borough was captured by Edward the Elder in 919, when after the\r\ndeath of his sister Ethelfleda he advanced into Danish Mercia, taking\r\nup the work which she had left unfinished.[111] The _Chronicle_ tells\r\nus that he repaired the borough (burh), and garrisoned it with both\r\nEnglish and Danes. Two years later, he evidently felt the necessity of\r\nfortifying the Trent itself, for he built another borough on the south\r\nside of the river, and connected the two boroughs by a bridge, which\r\nmust have included a causeway or a wooden stage across the marshes of\r\nthe Leen. It is not surprising that the frequent floods of the Trent\r\nhave carried away all trace of this second borough.[112] The important\r\nposition of Nottingham was maintained in subsequent times, and it was\r\nstill a borough at Domesday.\r\n\r\nTHELWALL.--According to Camden, Thelwall explains by its name the kind\r\nof work which was set up here, a wall composed of the trunks of trees.\r\nThis was another attempt to defend the course of the Mersey, which was\r\nonce tidal as far as Thelwall. No remains of any fortifications can\r\nnow be seen at Thelwall, which was not one of the boroughs which took\r\nroot. But the Mersey has changed its course very much at this point,\r\neven before the making of the Ship Canal effected a more complete\r\nalteration.[113]\r\n\r\nMANCHESTER.--The _burh_ repaired by Edward the Elder was no doubt\r\nthe Roman castrum, which was built on the triangle of land between\r\nthe Irwell and the Medlock. Large portions of the walls were still\r\nremaining in Stukeley's time, about 1700, and some fragments have\r\nrecently been unearthed by the Manchester Classical Association. It\r\nwas one of the smaller kind of Roman stations, its area being only 5\r\nacres. Manchester is not mentioned as a borough in Domesday, but the\r\nold Saxon town was long known as Aldportton, which literally means \"the\r\ntown of the old city.\" This is its title in mediæval deeds, and it is\r\nstill preserved in _Alport_ Street, a street near the remains of the\r\n_castrum_.[114] The later borough of Manchester, which existed at least\r\nas early as the 13th century, appears to have grown up round the Norman\r\ncastle, about a mile from the Roman castrum.[115]\r\n\r\nBAKEWELL.--The vagueness of the indication in the _Chronicle_, \"nigh\r\nto Bakewell,\" leaves us in some doubt where we are to look for this\r\n_burh_, which Florence calls an _urbs_. Just outside the village of\r\nBakewell there are the remains of a motte and bailey castle (a small\r\nmotte and bailey of 2 acres), which are always assumed to be the\r\n_burh_ of Edward. But the enclosure is far too small for a borough,\r\nand Edward's burh would certainly have enclosed the church; for though\r\nthe present church contains no Saxon architecture, the ancient cross\r\nin the graveyard shows that it stands on a Saxon site. It is more\r\nreasonable to suppose that Edward's borough, if it was at Bakewell,\r\nhas disappeared as completely as those of Runcorn, Buckingham, and\r\nThelwall, and that the motte and bailey belong to one of the many\r\nNorman castles whose names never appear in history. There is no\r\nconclusive evidence for the existence of a Norman castle at Bakewell,\r\nbut the names Castle Field, Warden Field, and Court Yard are at least\r\nsuggestive.[116] Bakewell was the seat of jurisdiction for the High\r\nPeak Hundred in mediæval times.[117]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDANISH FORTIFICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now inquire into the nature of the fortifications built by the\r\nDanes in England, which are frequently mentioned in the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_. It has often been asserted, and with great confidence, that\r\nthe Danes were the authors of the moated mounds of class(_e_); those\r\nin Ireland are invariably spoken of by Lewis in his _Topographical\r\nDictionary_ as \"Danish Raths.\" This fancy seems to have gone somewhat\r\nout of fashion since Mr Clark's _burh_ theory occupied the field,\r\nthough Mr Clark's view is often so loosely expressed as to lead one to\r\nthink that he supposed all the Northern nations to be makers of mottes;\r\nin fact, he frequently includes the Anglo-Saxons under the general\r\ntitle of \"Northmen\"![118] We must therefore endeavour to find out what\r\nthe Danish fortifications actually were.\r\n\r\nThe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ mentions twenty-four places where the\r\nDanes either threw up fortifications (between 787 and 924) or took up\r\nquarters either for the winter, or for such a period of time that we\r\nmay infer that there was some fortification to protect them. The word\r\nused for the fortification is generally _geweorc_, a work, or _fæsten_\r\n(in two places only), which has also the general vague meaning of a\r\n_fastness_. There are ten places where these works or fastnesses are\r\nmentioned in the _Chronicle_:--\r\n\r\n1. NOTTINGHAM.--We have already seen that the Danish host took up their\r\nwinter quarters here in 868, and that there is the highest probability\r\nthat the borough which Edward the Elder restored was first built by\r\nthem. We have also seen that it was a camp of roughly rectangular form,\r\nand enclosed a very large area, necessary for great numbers.[119]\r\n\r\n2. ROCHESTER.--This city was besieged by the Danes in 885, and they\r\nfortified a camp outside. As the artificial mound called Boley Hill is\r\noutside the city, most topographers have jumped to the conclusion that\r\nthis was the Danish camp. But the character of the Danish fortification\r\nis clearly indicated in the _Chronicle_: \"they made a work around\r\nthemselves,\" that is, it was an enclosure.[120] They could hardly have\r\nescaped by ship, as they did, if their camp had been above the bridge,\r\nwhich is known to have existed in Saxon times. But Boley Hill is above\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\n3. MILTON, in Kent (Middeltune).--Hæsten the Dane landed at the mouth\r\nof the Thames with 80 ships, and wrought a _geweorc_ here in 893. Two\r\nplaces in the neighbourhood of Milton have been suggested as the site\r\nof it, a square earthwork at Bayford Court, near Sittingbourne, and\r\na very small square enclosure called Castle Rough. Neither of these\r\nare large enough to have been of any use to a force which came in 80\r\nships.[121] Steenstrup has calculated that the average number of men in\r\na Viking ship must have been from 40 to 50; Hæsten therefore must have\r\nhad at least 3200 men with him. It is therefore probable that the camp\r\nat Milton has been swept away.\r\n\r\n4. APPLEDORE.--A still larger Danish force, which had been harrying\r\nthe Carlovingian empire, came in 250 ships, with their horses, in 893,\r\nand towed their ships \"up the river\" (which is now extinct) from Lymne\r\nto Appledore, where they wrought a work. There are no earthworks at\r\nAppledore now, but at Kenardington, 2 miles off, there are remains of\r\n\"a roughly defined rectangular work, situated on the north and east of\r\nthe church, on the slope of the hill towards the marsh, a very likely\r\nplace for an entrenchment thrown up to defend a fleet of light-draught\r\nships hauled up on the beach.\"[122] The enclosure was very large, one\r\nside which remains being 600 feet long.[123]\r\n\r\n5. BENFLEET.--Here Hæsten wrought a work in 894; here he was defeated\r\nby Alfred's forces, and some of his ships burnt. Mr Spurrell states\r\nthat there are still some irregular elevations by the stream and about\r\nthe church, which he believes to be remains of the Danish camp.[124]\r\n\"As the fleet of ships lay in the Beamfleet, it is obvious that the\r\ncamp must have partaken of the character of a fortified _hithe_, with\r\nthe wall landward and the shore open to the river and the ships.\" He\r\nalso learned on the spot that when the railway bridge across the Fleet\r\nwas being made, the remains of several ancient ships, charred by fire,\r\nand surrounded by numerous human skeletons, were found in the mud.[125]\r\nBenfleet must have been a very large camp, as not only was the joint\r\narmy of Danes housed in it, that from Milton and that from Appledore,\r\nbut they had with them their wives and children and cattle.\r\n\r\n6. SHOEBURY (Fig. 6).--After the storming of the camp at Benfleet by\r\nthe Saxon forces, the joint armies of the Danes built another _geweorc_\r\nat Shoebury in Essex. We should therefore expect a large camp here, and\r\nMr Spurrell has shown that the area was formerly about a third of a\r\nsquare mile. About half the camp had been washed away by the sea when\r\nMr Spurrell surveyed it in 1879, but enough was left to give a good\r\nidea of the whole. It was a roughly square rampart, with a ditch about\r\n40 feet wide, the ditch having a kind of berm on the inner side. The\r\nbank also had a slight platform inside, about 3 feet above the general\r\nlevel.[126] As Hæsten had lost his ships at Benfleet, there would be\r\nno fortified hithe connected with it, and if there had been, the sea\r\nwould have swept it away. The camp was abandoned almost as soon as it\r\nwas made, and the Danish army started on that remarkable march across\r\nEngland which the _Saxon Chronicle_ relates. They were overtaken and\r\nbesieged by Alfred's forces, in a _fastness_ at\r\n\r\n7. BUTTINGTON, on the Severn.--It has sometimes been contended that\r\nthis was the Buttington near Chepstow; but as the line of march of\r\nthe army was \"along the Thames till they reached the Severn, then up\r\nalong the Severn,\"[127] it is more probable that it was Buttington in\r\nMontgomery, west of Shrewsbury.[128] Here there are remains of a strong\r\nbank with a broad deep ditch, which was evidently part of a rectangular\r\nearthwork, as it runs at right angles to Offa's Dyke, which forms one\r\nside of it. It now encloses both the churchyard and vicarage. Whether\r\nthe Danes constructed this earthwork, or found it there, we are not\r\ntold.\r\n\r\n8. There appear to be no remains of the _geweorc_ on the river Lea,\r\n20 miles above London, made by the Danes in 896. But 20 miles above\r\nLondon, on the Lea, would land us at Amwell, near Ware. In Brayley's\r\n_Hertfordshire_ it is stated that at Amwell, \"on the hill above the\r\nchurch are traces of a very extensive fortification, the rampart of\r\nwhich is very distinguishable on the side overlooking the vale through\r\nwhich the river Lea flows.\"[129]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Shoebury, Essex.]\r\n\r\n9. BRIDGENORTH, or Quatbridge.--The Winchester MS. of the _Chronicle_\r\nsays the Danes wrought a _geweorc_ at Quatbridge, in 896, and passed\r\nthe winter there. There is no such place as Quatbridge now, only\r\nQuatford; and seeing there were so few bridges in those days, we are\r\ndisposed to accept the statement of the Worcester MS., which must have\r\nbeen the best informed about events in the west, that Bridgenorth\r\nwas the site of their work, especially as the high rock at Bridgenorth\r\noffers a natural fortification. The only circumstance that is in favour\r\nof Quatford is that it is mentioned as a _burgus_ in Domesday, which\r\nshows that it possessed fortifications of the civic kind; and we shall\r\nsee later on, that such fortifications were often the work of the\r\nDanes. But this burgus may more probably have been the work of Roger de\r\nMontgomeri, who planted a castle there in the 11th century.\r\n\r\n10. TEMPSFORD.--Here the Danes wrought a work in 918.[130] There is a\r\nsmall oblong enclosure at Tempsford, still in fair preservation, called\r\nGannock Castle, which is generally supposed to be this Danish work. The\r\nramparts are about 11 or 12 feet above the bottom of the moat, which is\r\nabout 20 feet wide. There is a small circular mound, about 5 feet high,\r\non top of the rampart, which appears to be so placed as to defend the\r\nentrance. This mound is \"edged all round by the root of a small bank,\r\nwhich may have been the base of a stockaded tower.\"[131] This curious\r\nlittle enclosure is different altogether from any of the Danish works\r\njust enumerated, and it is difficult to see what purpose it could have\r\nserved. The area enclosed is only half an acre, which would certainly\r\nnot have accommodated the large army \"from Huntingdon and from the East\r\nAngles,\" which built the advanced post at Tempsford as a base for the\r\nforcible recovery of the districts which they had lost.[132] Such a\r\nsmall enclosure as this might possibly have been a citadel, but our\r\nknowledge of Danish camps does not tell us of any with citadels, and it\r\nis hardly likely that the democratic constitution of these pirate bands\r\nwould have allowed of a citadel for the chief. It is far more probable\r\nthat this work belongs to a later time, and that the Danish camp has\r\nbeen swept away by the river.[133]\r\n\r\n11. READING.--There is no \"work\" mentioned by the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_ at this place, which the Danes made their headquarters\r\nin 871, but we add it to the list because Asser not only mentions\r\nit, but describes the nature of the fortification. It was a _vallum_\r\ndrawn between the rivers Thames and Kennet, so as to enclose a\r\npeninsula.[134] It had several entrances, as the Danes \"rushed out from\r\nall the gates\" on the Anglo-Saxon attack. Such a fort belongs to the\r\nsimplest and easiest kind of defence, used at all times by a general\r\nwho is in a hurry, and it has therefore no significance in determining\r\nthe general type of Danish works.\r\n\r\nBesides these eleven places where _works_ are mentioned, there are\r\nthirteen places where the Danes are said to have taken up their winter\r\nquarters, and where we may be certain that they were protected by some\r\nkind of fortifications. These are Thanet, Sheppey, Thetford, York,\r\nLondon, Torkesey, Repton, Cambridge, Exeter, Chippenham, Cirencester,\r\nFulham, and Mersey Island. Four places out of this list--York, London,\r\nExeter, and Cirencester--were Roman _castra_, whose walls were still\r\navailable for defence. Three--Thanet, Sheppey, and Mersey--were\r\nislands, and thus naturally defended, being much more insular than they\r\nare now.[135] Three--Thetford, Torkesey, and Cambridge--appear as\r\nburgi in Domesday, showing that they were fortified towns. It is highly\r\nprobable that the Danes threw up the first fortifications of these\r\nboroughs. There are no remains of town banks at Torkesey; at Cambridge\r\nthe outline of the town bank can be traced in places;[136] and at\r\nThetford there was formerly an earthwork on the Suffolk side of the\r\nriver, which appears to have formed three sides of a square, abutting\r\non the river, and enclosing the most ancient part of the town.[137]\r\nChippenham and Repton were ancient seats of the Anglo-Saxon kings, and\r\nmay have had fortifications, but nothing remains now. Chippenham is\r\na borough by prescription, therefore of ancient date. At Fulham, on\r\nthe Thames, there is a quadrangular moat and bank round the Bishop of\r\nLondon's palace, which is sometimes supposed to be the camp made by the\r\nDanes in 879; but it may equally well be mediæval. There was formerly a\r\nharbour at Fulham.[138]\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that this list of Danish fortresses furnishes us\r\nwith a very slender basis for generalisation as to the nature of Danish\r\nfortifications, judging from the actual remains. All we can say is that\r\nin six cases out of twenty-four (not including Tempsford or Fulham) the\r\nwork appears to have been rectangular. In the case of Shoebury, about\r\nwhich we have the best evidence, the imitation of Roman models seems\r\nto be clear. If we turn from remaining facts to _à priori_ likelihoods,\r\nwe call to mind that the Danes were a much-travelled people, had been\r\nin Gaul as well as in England, and had had opportunities of observing\r\nRoman fortifications, as well as much practice both in the assault and\r\ndefence of fortified places. It may not be without significance that it\r\nis not until after the return of \"the army\" from France that we hear of\r\ntheir building camps at all, except in the case of Reading.\r\n\r\nAs far as our information goes, their camps were without citadels. What\r\nevidence we have from the other side of the channel supports the same\r\nconclusion. Richer gives us an account of the storming of a fortress\r\nof the Northmen at Eu, by King Raoul, in 925, from which it is clear\r\nthat as soon as the king's soldiers had got over the vallum, they were\r\nmasters of the place; there was no citadel to attack.[139] Dudo speaks\r\nof the Vikings \"fortifying themselves, after the manner of a _castrum_,\r\nby heaped up earth-banks drawn round themselves,\" and it is clear from\r\nthe rest of his description that the camp had no citadel.[140]\r\n\r\nIn no case do we find anything to justify the theory that mottes were\r\nan accompaniment of Danish camps. In five cases out of the twenty-four\r\nthere are or were mottes at the places mentioned, but in all cases\r\nthey belonged to Norman castles. The magnificent motte called the\r\nCastle Hill at Thetford was on the opposite side of the river to the\r\nborough, which we have seen reason to think was the site of the Danish\r\nwinter quarters. Torkesey in Leland's time had by the river side \"a\r\nHille of Yerth cast up,\" which he judged to be the donjon of some old\r\ncastle, probably rightly, though we have been unable as yet to find any\r\nmention of a Norman castle at Torkesey; a brick castle of much more\r\nrecent date is still standing near the river, and probably the motte to\r\nwhich Leland alludes was destroyed when this was built. The motte at\r\nCambridge is placed inside the original bounds of the borough, and was\r\npart of the Norman castle.[141] We have already dealt with the Boley\r\nHill at Rochester, and shall have more to say about it hereafter. The\r\nrock motte at Nottingham was probably not cut off by a ditch from the\r\nrest of the headland until the Norman castle was built.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Willington, Beds.]\r\n\r\nIt seems highly probable that besides providing accommodation in their\r\ncamps for very large numbers of people, the Danes sometimes fortified\r\nthe hithes where they drew up their ships on shore, or even constructed\r\nfortified harbours.[142] We have already quoted Mr Spurrell's remark\r\non the hithe[143] at Benfleet (p. 51), and there is at least one place\r\nin England which seems to prove the existence of fortified harbours.\r\nThis is Willington, on the river Ouse, in Bedfordshire, which has been\r\ncarefully described by Mr A. R. Goddard.[144] This \"camp\" consists\r\nof two wards, and a wide outer enclosure (Fig. 7). \"But one of the\r\nmost interesting features is the presence of two harbours, contained\r\nwithin the defences and communicating with the river.\" Mr Goddard\r\npoints out that the dimensions of the smaller one are almost the same\r\nas those of the \"nausts\" (ship-sheds or small docks) of the Vikings in\r\nIceland. He also cites from the _Jomsvikinga Saga_ the description of\r\na harbour made by the Viking Palnatoki at Jomsborg. \"There he had a\r\nlarge and strong sea _burg_ made. He also had a harbour made within the\r\n_burg_ in which 300 long ships could lie at the same time, all being\r\nlocked within the burg.\" The harbours at Willington are large enough\r\nto accommodate between twenty-five and thirty-five ships of the Danish\r\ntype. Unfortunately there is no historical proof that the Willington\r\nworks were Danish, though their construction makes it very likely. Nor\r\nhave any works of a similar character been as yet observed in England,\r\nas far as we are aware.\r\n\r\nBut if archæology and topography give a somewhat scanty answer to our\r\nquestion about the nature of Danish fortifications, there are other\r\nfields of research, opened up of late years, from which we can glean\r\nimportant facts, bearing directly on the subject which we are treating.\r\nHerr Steenstrup's exhaustive inquiry into the Danish settlement in\r\nEngland has shown that the way in which the Danes maintained their hold\r\non the northern and eastern shires was by planting fortified towns on\r\nwhich the soldiers and peasants dwelling around were dependent.[145]\r\nThe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ gives us a glimpse of these arrangements\r\nwhen it speaks of the Danes who owed obedience to Bedford, Derby,\r\nLeicester, Northampton, and Cambridge.[146] It also tells us of the\r\nFive Boroughs, which, as we have already said, appear to have been a\r\nconfederation of boroughs forming an independent Danish state between\r\nthe Danish kingdoms of East Anglia and Northumbria.\r\n\r\nThe same system was followed by the Danes who colonised Ireland.\r\n\"The colony had a centre in a fortified town, or it consisted almost\r\nexclusively of dwellers in one. But round this town was a district,\r\nin which the Irish inhabitants had to pay taxes to the lords of the\r\ntown.\"[147] The Irish chronicle called _The Wars of the Gaedhil and the\r\nGaill_ says, further, that Norse soldiers were quartered in the country\r\nround these towns in the houses of the native Irish, and it even says\r\nthat there was hardly a house without a Norseman.[148] Herr Steenstrup\r\ndoes not go so far as to assert that this system of quartering obtained\r\nin England also; but he shows that it is probable, and we may add\r\nthat such a system would help to explain the speedy absorption of the\r\nDanes into the Anglo-Saxon population, which took place in the Danelaw\r\ndistricts.[149]\r\n\r\nThe large numbers of the Danish forces, and the fact that in the second\r\nperiod of their invasions they brought their wives and children with\r\nthem, would render camps of large area necessary. These numbers alone\r\nmake it ridiculous to attribute to the Danes the small motte castles of\r\nclass (_e_), whose average area is not more than 3 acres.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Danish host was not a feudal host. Steenstrup asserts\r\nthat the principle of the composition of the host was the voluntary\r\nassociation of equally powerful leaders, of whom one was chosen\r\nas head, and was implicitedly obeyed, but had only a temporary\r\nauthority.[150] We should not, therefore, expect to find the Danish\r\ncamps provided with the citadels by which the feudal baron defended his\r\npersonal safety. When Rollo and his host were coming up the Seine, the\r\nFrankish king Raoul sent messengers to ask them who they were, and what\r\nwas the name of their chief. \"Danes,\" was the reply, \"and we have no\r\nchief, for we are all equal.\"[151] That such an answer would be given\r\nby men who were following a leader so distinguished as Rollo shows the\r\nspirit of independence which pervaded the Danish hosts, and how little\r\na separate fortification for the chief would comport with their methods\r\nof warfare.[152]\r\n\r\nWe may conclude, then, with every appearance of certainty that the\r\nDanish camps were enclosures of large area which very much resembled\r\nthe larger Roman _castra_, and that, like these, they frequently\r\ngrew into towns. Placed as they generally were on good havens, or\r\non navigable rivers, they were most suitable places for trade; and\r\nit turned out that the Danes, who were a people of great natural\r\naptitudes, had a special aptitude for commerce.[153] Dr Cunningham\r\nremarks that they were the leading merchants of the country, and he\r\nattributes to them a large share in the development of town life in\r\nEngland.[154] The organisation of their armies was purely military, but\r\nat the same time democratic; and when it was applied to a settled life\r\nin the new country, the organisation of the town was the form which it\r\ntook. The Lagmen of Lincoln, Stamford, Cambridge, Chester, and York are\r\na peculiarly Scandinavian institution, which we find still existing at\r\nthe time of the Domesday Survey.[155]\r\n\r\nThus we see that the fortifications of the Danes, like those of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons, were the fortifications of the community. And we\r\nshall see in the next chapter that this was the general type of the\r\nfortifications which were being raised in Western Europe in the 9th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF PRIVATE CASTLES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that history furnishes no instance of the existence\r\nof private castles among the Anglo-Saxons or the Danes (previous\r\nto the arrival of Edward the Confessor's Norman friends), and we\r\nhave endeavoured to show that this negative evidence is of great\r\nsignificance. If, assuming that we are right in accepting it as\r\nconclusive, we ask why the Anglo-Saxons did not build private castles,\r\nthe answer is ready to hand in the researches of the late Dr Stubbs,\r\nthe late Professor Maitland, Dr J. H. Round, and Professor Vinogradoff,\r\nwhich have thrown so much fresh light on the constitutional history\r\nof England. These writers have made it clear that whatever tendencies\r\ntowards feudalism there were in England before the Conquest, the system\r\nof military tenure, which is the backbone of feudalism, was introduced\r\ninto England by William the Conqueror.[156] \"Feudalism, in both\r\ntenure and government was, so far as it existed in England, brought\r\nfull-grown from France,\" says Dr Stubbs; and this statement is not\r\nmerely supported, but strengthened, by the work of the later writers\r\nnamed.[157] The institutions of the Anglo-Saxons, when they settled in\r\nEngland, were tribal; and though these institutions were in a state\r\nof decay in the 11th century, they were not completely superseded by\r\nfeudal institutions till after the Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\nWe should naturally expect, then, that the fortifications erected by\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons would be those adapted to their originally tribal\r\nstate, that is, in the words which we have so often used already,\r\nthey would be those of the community and not of the individual. And\r\nas far as we can discover the character of these fortifications, we\r\nfind that this was actually the case. As we have seen, we find one of\r\nthe earliest kings, Ida, building for the defence of himself and his\r\nfollowers what Bede calls a city; and we find Alfred and his children\r\nalso building and repairing cities, at the time of the Danish invasions.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of thing was going on at about the same time in Germany\r\nand in France. Henry the Fowler (919-936), that great restorer of the\r\nAustrasian kingdom, planted on the frontiers which were exposed to\r\nthe attacks of the Danes and Huns a number of walled strongholds, not\r\nonly for the purpose of resisting invasion, but to afford a place of\r\nrefuge to all the inhabitants of the country. He ordained that every\r\nninth man of the peasants in the district must build for himself and\r\nhis nine companions a dwelling in the \"Burg,\" and provide barns and\r\nstorehouses, and that the third part of all crops must be delivered\r\nand housed in these towns.[158] In this way, says the historian\r\nGiesebrecht, he sought to accustom the Saxons, who had hitherto dwelt\r\nin isolated farms, or open villages, to life in towns. He ordered that\r\nall assemblies of the people should be held in towns. Giesebrecht also\r\nremarks that it is not improbable that Henry the Fowler had the example\r\nof Edward the Elder of England before his eyes when he established\r\nthese rows of frontier towns.[159]\r\n\r\nThe same causes led, on Neustrian soil, to the fortification of a\r\nnumber of cities, the walls of which had fallen into decay during the\r\nperiod of peace before the invasions of the Danes. Thus Charles the\r\nBald commanded Le Mans and Tours to be fortified \"as a defence _for\r\nthe people_ against the Northmen.\"[160] The bishops were particularly\r\nactive in thus defending the people of their dioceses. Archbishop Fulk\r\nrebuilt the walls of Rheims, between 884 and 900;[161] his successor,\r\nHervey, fortified the town of Coucy[162] (about 900); the Bishop of\r\nCambray built new walls to his city in 887-911;[163] and Bishop Erluin\r\nfortified Peronne in 1001, \"as a defence against marauders, and a\r\nrefuge for the husbandmen of the country.\"[164] But permission had\r\nprobably to be asked in all these cases, as it certainly had in the\r\nlast. The Carlovingian sovereigns represented a well-ordered state,\r\nmodelled on the pattern of the Roman Empire; they were jealous of any\r\nattempts at self-defence which did not proceed from the State, and thus\r\nas long as they had the power they strove to put down all associations\r\nor buildings of a military character which did not emanate from their\r\nimperial authority.\r\n\r\nThe history of the 9th and 10th centuries is the history of the gradual\r\nbreak-up of the Carlovingian Empire, and the rise of feudalism on\r\nits ruins. In 877, the year of his death, Charles the Bald signed a\r\ndecree making the counts of the provinces, who until then had been\r\nimperial officers, hereditary. He thus, as Sismondi says, annihilated\r\nthe remains of royal authority in the provinces.[165] The removable\r\nofficers now became local sovereigns. Gradually, as the Carlovingian\r\nEmpire fell to pieces, the artificial organisation of the feudal system\r\narose to take its place. By the end of the 10th century the victory of\r\nfeudalism was complete; and the victory of feudalism was the victory of\r\nthe private castle.\r\n\r\n\"The very word castle,\" says Guizot, \"brings with it the idea of\r\nfeudal society; we see it rising before us. It was feudalism that\r\nbuilt these castles which once covered our soil, and whose ruins are\r\nstill scattered upon it. They were the declaration of its triumph.\r\nNothing like them had existed on Gallo-Roman soil. Before the Germanic\r\ninvasion, the great landed proprietors dwelt either in the cities, or\r\nin beautiful houses agreeably situated near the cities.\"[166] These\r\nGallo-Roman villas had no fortifications;[167] nor were the Roman\r\nvillas in England fortified.[168] It was the business of the State to\r\ndefend the community; this was the theory so long sustained by imperial\r\nRome, and which broke down so completely under the later Carlovingians.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Charlemagne and Louis le Debonnaire, even the royal\r\npalaces do not appear to have been fortified. They were always spoken\r\nof as _palatia_, never as _castella_. The Danes, when they took\r\npossession of the palace of Nimeguen in 880, fortified it with ditches\r\nand banks.[169] Charles the Bald appears to have been the first to\r\nfortify the palace of Compiègne.[170]\r\n\r\nAlthough there can be no doubt that private castles had become\r\nextremely common on the mainland of Western Europe before the end of\r\nthe 10th century, it is more difficult than is generally supposed to\r\ntrace their first appearance. Historians, even those of great repute,\r\nhave been somewhat careless in translating the words _castrum_ or\r\n_castellum_ as _castle_ or _château_, and taking them in the sense of\r\nthe feudal or private castle.[171] We have already pointed out that\r\nthese words in our Anglo-Saxon charters mean a town or village.[172]\r\nThe fact is that from Roman times until toward the end of the 9th\r\ncentury the words _castrum_ and _castellum_ are used indifferently\r\nfor a fortified city or town, or a temporary camp. The expression\r\n_civitates et castella_ is not uncommon, and might lead one to think\r\nthat a distinction was drawn between large and small towns, or forts.\r\nBut it is far more likely that it is a mere pleonasm, a bit of that\r\nredundancy which was always dear to the mediæval scribe who was trying\r\nto write well. For as the instances cited in the Appendix will prove,\r\nwe constantly find the words _castrum_ and _castellum_ used for the\r\nsame town, sometimes even in the same paragraph. Later, from the last\r\nquarter of the 9th century to the middle of the 12th century, these\r\nsame words are used indifferently for a town or a castle, and it is\r\nimpossible to tell, except by the context, whether a town or a castle\r\nis meant; and often even the context throws no light upon it.\r\n\r\nThis makes it extremely difficult to say with any exactness when the\r\nprivate castle first arose. We seem indeed to have a fixed date in\r\nthe Capitulary of Pistes, issued by Charles the Bald in 864,[173] in\r\nwhich he straightly ordered that all who had made castles, forts, or\r\nhedge-works without his permission should forthwith be compelled to\r\ndestroy them, because through them the whole neighbourhood suffered\r\ndepredation and annoyance. This edict shows, we might argue, that\r\nprivate castles were sufficiently numerous by the year 864 to have\r\nbecome a public nuisance, calling for special legislation. But the\r\nchronicles of the second half of the 9th century do not reveal any\r\nextensive prevalence of private castles. Indeed, after studying all\r\nthe most important chronicles of Neustria and Austrasia during this\r\nperiod, the present writer has only been able to find four instances\r\nof fortifications which have any claim at all to be considered private\r\ncastles; and even this claim is doubtful.[174]\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the chroniclers of the middle of the 10th century\r\nwe find a marked difference. It is true that the words _castrum_,\r\n_castellum_, _municipium_, _oppidum_, _munitio_, are still used quite\r\nindifferently by Flodoard and other writers for one and the same thing,\r\nand that in a great many cases they obviously mean a fortified town.\r\nBut there are other cases where they evidently mean a castle. And if\r\nwe compare these writers with the earlier ones in the same way as we\r\nhave already compared the pre-Conquest portion of the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_ with the chroniclers of the 11th and 12th centuries, we\r\nfind the same contrast between them. In the pages of Flodoard or Ademar\r\nthe action constantly turns on the building, besieging, and burning of\r\ncastles, which by whatever name they are called, have every appearance\r\nof being private castles. In fact before we get to the end of the\r\ncentury, the private castle is as much the leading feature of the drama\r\nas it is in the 11th or 12th centuries.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, had the chroniclers no fresh word for a thing which\r\nwas in its essential nature so novel? The obvious and only answer\r\nis that the private castle in its earlier stages was nothing\r\nmore than an embankment with a wooden stockade thrown round some\r\n_villa_ or farm belonging to a private owner, and was therefore\r\nindistinguishable in appearance, though radically different in idea,\r\nfrom the fortifications which had hitherto been thrown up for the\r\nprotection of the community.[175] How easily we may be mistaken in\r\nthe meaning of the word _castellum_, if we interpret it according\r\nto modern ideas, may be seen by comparing the account of the bridge\r\nbuilt by Charlemagne over the Elbe, in the _Annales Laurissenses_,\r\nwith Eginhards narrative of the same affair. The former states that\r\nCharlemagne built a _castellum_ of wood and earth at each end of the\r\nbridge, while the latter tells us that it was a _vallum_ to protect\r\na garrison which he placed there. This, however, was a work of\r\npublic utility, and not a private castle. But scanty as the evidence\r\nis, it all leads us to infer that the first private castles were\r\nfortifications of this simple nature.[176] Mazières-on-the-Meuse, which\r\nwas besieged for four weeks by Archbishop Hervey, took its name from\r\nthe _macerias_ or banks which Count Erlebald had constructed around\r\nit. It is impossible to say whether this enclosure should be called a\r\ncastle or a town, but in idea it was certainly a castle, since it was\r\nan enclosure formed for private, not for public interests.\r\n\r\nWhether these first private castles were provided with towers we have\r\nno evidence either to prove or to disprove. No instance occurs from\r\nwhich we can conclude that they possessed any kind of citadel, before\r\nthe middle of the 10th century.[177] But before the century is far\r\nadvanced, we hear of towers in connection with the great towns, which,\r\nwhether they were originally mural towers or not, are evidently private\r\nstrongholds, and may justly be called keeps. The earliest instance\r\nknown to the writer is in 924, when the tower of the _presidium_\r\nwhere Herbert Count of Vermandois had imprisoned Charles the Simple\r\nwas burnt accidentally.[178] This tower must have been restored, as\r\nnine years later it withstood a six weeks' siege from King Raoul. A\r\npossibly earlier instance is that of Nantes, where Bishop Fulcher had\r\nmade a castle in 889; for when this castle was restored by Count Alan\r\nBarbetorte (937-943), we are told that he _restored_ the principal\r\ntower and made it into his own house.[179] Count Herbert built a keep\r\nin Laon before 931; and this appears to have been a different tower to\r\nthe one attached to the royal house which Louis d'Outremer had built\r\nat the gate of the city.[180] We hear also of towers at Amiens (950),\r\nCoucy (958), Chalons (963), and Rheims (988). All these towers, it will\r\nbe observed, are connected with towns.[181] The first stone keep in the\r\ncountry for whose date we have positive evidence, is that of Langeais,\r\nbuilt by Fulk Nerra, Count of Anjou, about the year 994; its ruins\r\nstill exist.\r\n\r\nBut we are concerned more particularly here with the origin of\r\nthe motte-and-bailey castle. The exact place or time of its first\r\nappearance is still a matter of conjecture. Certainly there is not a\r\nword in the chronicles which is descriptive of this kind of castle\r\nbefore the beginning of the 11th century.[182] The first historical\r\nmention of a castle which is clearly of the motte-and-bailey kind is\r\nin the Chronicle of St Florent le Vieil, where, at a date which the\r\nmodern biographer of Fulk Nerra fixes at 1010, we learn that this\r\nsame Count of Anjou built a castle on the western side of the hill\r\nMont-Glonne, at St Florent le Vieil, on the Loire, and threw up an\r\n_agger_ on which he built a wooden tower.[183] In this case the word\r\n_agger_ evidently means a motte. But Fulk began to reign in 987;\r\nhe was a great builder of castles, and was famed for his skill in\r\nmilitary affairs.[184] One of his first castles, built between 991 and\r\n994, was at Montbazon, not far from Tours. About 500 metres from the\r\nlater castle of Montbazon is a motte and outworks, which De Salies\r\nnot unreasonably supposes to be the original castle of Fulk.[185]\r\nMontrichard, Chateaufort, Chérament, Montboyau, and Baugé are all\r\ncastles built by Fulk, and all have or had mottes. Montboyau is the\r\nclearest case of all, as it was demolished by Fulk a few years after he\r\nbuilt it, and has never been restored, so that the immense motte and\r\noutworks which are still to be seen remain very much in their original\r\nstate, except that a modern tower has been placed on the motte, which\r\nis now called Bellevue.[186]\r\n\r\nIt was a tempting theory at one time to the writer to see in Fulk Nerra\r\nthe inventor of the motte type of castle, for independently of his fame\r\nin military architecture, he is the first mediæval chieftain who is\r\nknown to have employed mercenary troops.[187] Now as we have already\r\nsuggested in Chapter I., the plan of the motte-and-bailey castle\r\nstrongly suggests that there may be a connection between its adoption\r\nand the use of mercenaries. For the plan of this kind of castle seems\r\nto hint that the owner does not only mistrust his enemies, he also does\r\nnot completely trust his garrison. The keep in which he and his family\r\nlive is placed on the top of the motte, which is ditched round so as to\r\nseparate it from the bailey; the provisions on which all are dependent\r\nare stored in the cellar of the keep, so that they are under his own\r\nhand; and the keys of the outer ward are brought to him every night,\r\nand placed under his pillow.[188]\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately for this theory, there is some evidence of the\r\nraising of mottes at an earlier period in the 10th century than the\r\naccession of Fulk Nerra. Thibault-le-Tricheur, who was Count of Blois\r\nand Chartres from 932 to 962, was also a great builder, and it is\r\nrecorded of him that he built the keeps of Chartres, Chateaudun,[189]\r\nBlois, and Chinon,[190] and the castle of Saumur; these must have been\r\nfinished before 962. Now there was anciently a motte at Blois, for in\r\nthe 12th century, Fulk V. of Anjou burnt the whole fortress, \"_except\r\nthe house on the motte_.\"[191] There was also a motte at Saumur;[192]\r\nand the plan of the castle of Chinon is not inconsistent with the\r\nexistence of a former motte.[193] These instances seem to put back the\r\nexistence of the motte castle to the middle of the 10th century.\r\n\r\nWe know of no earlier claim than this, unless we were to accept the\r\nstatement of Lambert of Ardres that Sigfrid the Dane, who occupied the\r\ncounty of Guisnes about the year 928, fortified the town, and enclosed\r\nhis own _dunio_ with a double ditch.[194] If this were true, we have a\r\nclear instance of a motte built in the first half of the 10th century.\r\nBut Lambert's work was written at the end of the 12th century, with the\r\nobject of glorifying the counts of Guisnes, and its editor regards\r\nthe early part of it as fabulous. That Sigfrid fortified the _town_ of\r\nGuisnes we can easily believe, as we know the Danes commonly did the\r\nlike (see Chapter IV.); but that he built himself a personal castle is\r\nunlikely.[195]\r\n\r\nIt is the more unlikely, because the Danes in Normandy do not appear\r\nto have built personal castles until the feudal system was introduced\r\nthere by Richard Sans Peur. The settlement in Normandy was not on\r\nfeudal lines. \"Rollo divided out the lands among his powerful comrades,\r\nand there is scarcely any doubt that they received these lands as\r\ninheritable property, without any other pledge than to help Rollo in\r\nthe defence of the country.\"[196] \"The Norman constitution at Rollo's\r\ndeath can be described thus, that the duke ruled the country as an\r\nindependent prince in relation to the Franks; but for its internal\r\ngovernment he had a council at his side, whose individual members felt\r\nthemselves almost as powerful as the duke himself.\"[197] Sir Francis\r\nPalgrave asserts that feudalism was introduced into Normandy by the\r\nDuke Richard Sans Peur, the grandson of Rollo, towards the middle of\r\nthe 10th century. He \"enforced a most extensive conversion of allodial\r\nlands into feudal tenure,\" and exacted from his baronage the same\r\nfeudal submission which he himself had rendered to Hugh Capet.[198]\r\n\r\nIt is quite in accordance with this that in the narrative of Dudo, who\r\nis our only authority for the history of Normandy in the 10th century,\r\nthere is no mention of a private castle anywhere. We are told that\r\nRollo restored the walls and towers of the _cities_ of Normandy,[199]\r\nand it is clear from the context that the _castra_ of Rouen, Fécamp,\r\nand Evreux, which are mentioned, are fortified cities, not castles.\r\nEven the ducal residence at Rouen is spoken of as a _palatium_ or an\r\n_aula_, not as a castle; and it does not appear to have possessed a\r\nkeep until (as we are told by a later writer) the same Duke Richard\r\nwho introduced the feudal system into Normandy built one for his own\r\nresidence.[200] It is possible that when the feudal oath was exacted\r\nfrom the more important barons, permission was given to them to build\r\ncastles for themselves; thus we hear from Ordericus of the castle of\r\nAquila, built in the days of Duke Richard; the castle of the lords\r\nof Grantmesnil at Norrei; the castle of Belesme; all of which appear\r\nto have been private castles.[201] But there seems to have been no\r\ngeneral building of castles until the time of William the Conqueror's\r\nminority, when his rebellious subjects raised castles against him\r\non all sides. \"Plura per loca aggeres erexerunt, et tutissimas sibi\r\nmunitiones construxerunt.\"[202] It is generally, and doubtless\r\ncorrectly, supposed that _aggeres_ in this passage means mottes, and\r\ntaking this statement along with the great number of mottes which\r\nare still to be found in Normandy, it has been further assumed (and\r\nthe present writer was disposed to share the idea) that this was the\r\ntime of the first invention of mottes. But the facts which have\r\nbeen now adduced, tracing back the first known mottes to the time of\r\nThibault-le-Tricheur, and the county of Blois, show that the Norman\r\nclaim to the invention of this mode of fortification must be given up.\r\nIf the Normans were late in adopting feudalism, they were probably\r\nequally late in adopting private castles, and the fortifications of\r\nWilliam I.'s time were most likely copied from castles outside the\r\nNorman frontier.[203]\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that the general expectation of the end of the\r\nworld in the year 1000, which prevailed towards the end of the 10th\r\ncentury, had something to do with the spread of these wooden castles,\r\nas it might have seemed scarcely worth while to build costly structures\r\nof stone. But it is not necessary to resort to this hypothesis,\r\nbecause there is quite sufficient evidence to show that long before\r\nthis forecast of doom was accepted, wood was a very common, if not\r\nthe commonest, material used in fortification. The reader has only to\r\nopen his Cæsar to see how familiar wooden towers and wooden palisades\r\nwere to the Romans; and he has only to study carefully the chronicles\r\nof the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries to see how all-prevalent\r\nthis mode of fortification continued to be. The general adoption of\r\nthe feudal system must have brought about a demand for cheap castles,\r\nwhich was excellently met by the motte with its wooden keep and its\r\nstockaded bailey. M. Enlart has pointed out that wooden defences\r\nhave one important advantage over stone ones, their greater cohesion,\r\nwhich enabled them to resist the blows of the battering-ram better\r\nthan rubble masonry.[204] Their great disadvantage was their liability\r\nto fire; but this was obviated, as in the time of the Romans, by\r\nspreading wet hides over the outsides. Stone castles were still built,\r\nwhere money and means were available, as we see from Fulk Nerra's keep\r\nat Langeais; but the devastations of the Northmen had decimated the\r\npopulation of Gaul; labour must have been dear, and skilled masons hard\r\nto find. In these social and economic reasons we have sufficient cause\r\nfor the rapid spread of wooden castles in France.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the evidence which we have been reviewing is this:\r\nthe earliest mottes which we know of were _probably_ built by\r\nThibault-le-Tricheur about the middle of the 10th century. But in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge we must leave the question of the time\r\nand place of their first origin open. The only thing about which we can\r\nbe certain is that they were the product of feudalism, and cannot have\r\narisen till it had taken root; that is to say, not earlier than the\r\n10th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MOTTE-CASTLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motte-and-bailey type of castle is to be found throughout feudal\r\nEurope, but is probably more prevalent in France and the British\r\nIsles than anywhere else. We say _probably_, because there are as\r\nyet no statistics prepared on which to base a comparison.[205] How\r\nrecent the inquiry into this subject is may be learned from the fact\r\nthat Krieg von Hochfelden, writing in 1859, denied the existence of\r\nmottes in Germany;[206] and even Cohausen in 1898 threw doubt upon\r\nthem,[207] although General Köhler in 1887 had already declared that\r\n\"the researches of recent years have shown that the motte was spread\r\nover the whole of Germany, and was in use even in the 13th and 14th\r\ncenturies.\"[208] The greater number of the castles described by Piper\r\nin his work on Austrian castles are on the motte-and-bailey plan,\r\nthough the motte in those mountainous provinces is generally of natural\r\nrock, isolated either by nature or art. Mottes were not uncommon in\r\nItaly, according to Muratori,[209] and are especially frequent in\r\nCalabria, where we may strongly suspect that they were introduced by\r\nthe Norman conqueror, Robert Guiscard.[210] It is not improbable that\r\nthe Franks of the first crusade planted in Palestine the type of castle\r\nto which they were accustomed at home, for several of the excellent\r\nplans in Rey's _Architecture des Croisés_ show clearly enough the\r\nmotte-and-bailey plan.[211] In most of these cases the motte was a\r\nnatural rock.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we are told by Köhler that motte-castles are not\r\nfound among the Slavonic nations, because they never adopted the feudal\r\nsystem.[212] Nor are there any in Norway or Sweden.[213] Denmark\r\nhas some, which are attributed by Dr Sophus Müller to the mediæval\r\nperiod.[214]\r\n\r\nOf course whenever a motte was thrown up, the first castle upon it\r\nmust have been a wooden one. A stone keep could not be placed on\r\nloose soil.[215] The motte, therefore, must always represent the\r\noldest castle. But there is no reason to think that the motte and\r\nits wooden keep were merely temporary expedients, intended always to\r\nbe replaced as soon as possible by stone buildings. Even after stone\r\ncastles had been fully developed, wood continued to hold its ground as\r\na solid building material until a very late period.[216] And mottes\r\nwere used not only throughout the 11th and 12th centuries, but even\r\nas late as the 13th. King John built many castles of this type in\r\nIreland; and as late as 1242 Henry III. ordered a motte and wooden\r\ncastle to be built in the island of Rhé.[217] Muratori gives a much\r\nlater instance: in 1320 Can Grande caused a great motte to be built\r\nnear Pavia, and surrounded with a ditch and hedge, in order to build\r\na castle on it.[218] And as will be seen in the next chapter, there\r\nis considerable evidence that many mottes in England which were set up\r\nin the reign of William I., retained their wooden towers or stockades\r\neven till as late as the reign of Edward I. The motte at Drogheda held\r\nout some time against Cromwell, and is spoken of by him as a very\r\nstrong place, having a good graft (ditch) and strongly palisaded.[219]\r\nTickhill Castle in Yorkshire had a palisade on the counterscarp of the\r\nditch when it was taken by Cromwell.[220]\r\n\r\nThe position of these motte-castles is wholly different from that\r\nof prehistoric fortresses. They are almost invariably placed in the\r\narable country, and as a rule not in isolated situations, but in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of towns or villages. It is rare indeed to\r\nfind a motte-castle in a wild, mountainous situation in England. The\r\nonly instance which occurs to the writer is that of the motte on the\r\ntop of the Hereford Beacon; but there is great probability that this\r\nwas a post fortified by the Bishop of Hereford in the 13th century to\r\nprotect his game from the Earl of Gloucester. Nothing pointing to a\r\nprehistoric origin was found in this motte when it was excavated by Mr\r\nHilton Price,[221] though the camp in which it is placed is supposed to\r\nbe prehistoric.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of mottes in England are planted either on or near\r\nRoman or other ancient roads, or on navigable rivers.[222] It was\r\nessential to the Norman settlers that they should be near some road\r\nwhich would help them to visit their other estates, which William had\r\nbeen so careful to scatter, and would also enable them to revisit from\r\ntime to time their estates in Normandy.[223] The rivers of England were\r\nmuch fuller of water in mediæval times than they are now, and were much\r\nmore extensively used for traffic; they were real waterways. When we\r\nfind a motte perched on a river which is not navigable, the purpose\r\nprobably was to defend some ford, or to exact tolls from passengers.\r\nThus the Ferry Hill (corrupted into Fairy Hill) at Whitwood stands at\r\nthe spot where the direct road from Pontefract to Leeds would cross the\r\nCalder. It was probably not usual for the motte to be dependent on a\r\nstream or a spring for its supply of water, and this is another point\r\nin which the mediæval castle differs markedly from the prehistoric\r\ncamp; wells have been found in a number of mottes which have been\r\nexcavated, and it is probable that this was the general plan, though we\r\nhave not sufficient statistics on this subject as yet.[224]\r\n\r\nOccasionally, but very rarely, we find two mottes in the same castle.\r\nThe only instances in England known to the writer are at Lewes and\r\nLincoln.[225] It is not unfrequent to find a motte very near a stone\r\ncastle. In this case it is either the abandoned site of the original\r\nwooden castle, or it is a siege castle raised to blockade the other\r\none. We constantly hear of these siege castles being built in the\r\nMiddle Ages; their purpose was not for actual attack, but to watch the\r\nbesieged fort and prevent supplies from being carried in.[226] Hillocks\r\nwere also thrown up for the purpose of placing _balistæ_ and other\r\nsiege engines upon them; but these would be much smaller than mottes,\r\nand would be placed much nearer the walls than blockade castles.\r\n\r\nThe mottes of France are in all probability much more decidedly\r\nmilitary than those of England. France was a land of private war, after\r\nthe dissolution of the empire of Charlemagne; and no doubt one of the\r\nreasons for the rapid spread of the motte-castle, after its invention,\r\nwas due to the facilities which it offered for this terrible game.\r\nIn England the reasons for the erection of mottes seem to have been\r\nmanorial rather than military; that is, the Norman landholder desired\r\na safe residence for himself amidst a hostile peasantry, rather than\r\na strong military position which could hold out against skilful and\r\nwell-armed foes.\r\n\r\nAttached to the castle, both in England and abroad, we frequently\r\nfind an additional enclosure, much larger than the comparatively\r\nsmall area of the bailey proper. This was the _burgus_ or borough,\r\nwhich inevitably sprang up round every castle which had a lengthened\r\nexistence. Our older antiquaries, finding that the word _burgenses_\r\nwas commonly used in Domesday in connection with a site where a\r\ncastle existed, formed the mistaken idea that a _burgus_ necessarily\r\nimplied a castle. But a _burgus_ was the same thing as a _burh_, that\r\nis, a _borough_ or fortified town. It may have existed long before the\r\ncastle, or it may have been created after the castle was built. The\r\nlatter case was very common, for the noble who built a castle would\r\nfind it to his advantage to build a _burgus_ near it.[227] In exchange\r\nfor the protection offered by the borough wall or bank, he could demand\r\n_gablum_ or rent from the burghers; he could compel them to grind their\r\ncorn at his mill, and bake their bread at his oven; he could exact\r\ntolls on all commodities entering the borough; and if there was a\r\nmarket he would receive a certain percentage on all sales. The borough\r\nwas therefore an important source of revenue to the baron. Domesday\r\nBook mentions the _new borough_ at Rhuddlan, evidently built as soon\r\nas the castle had been planted on the deserted banks of the Clwydd. In\r\nsome cases a \"new borough\" is clearly a new suburb, doubtless having\r\nits own fortifications, built specially for the protection of the\r\nNorman settlers in England, as at Norwich and Nottingham.[228]\r\n\r\nThat even in the 12th century a motte was considered an essential\r\nfeature of a castle is shown by Neckham's treatise \"De Utensilibus,\"\r\nwhere he gives directions as to how a castle should be built; the motte\r\nshould be placed on a site well defended by nature; it should have a\r\nstockade of squared logs round the top; the keep on the motte should\r\nbe furnished with turrets and battlements, and crates of stones for\r\nmissiles should be always provided, as well as a perpetual spring of\r\nwater, and secret passages and posterns, by which help might reach the\r\nbesieged.[229]\r\n\r\nWhat the outward appearance of these motte-castles was we learn from\r\nthe Bayeux Tapestry, which gives us several instructive pictures of\r\nmotte-castles existing in the 11th century at Dol, Rennes, Dinan,\r\nand Bayeux.[230] There is considerable variety in these pictures,\r\nand something no doubt must be ascribed to fancy; but all show the\r\nmain features of a stockade round the top of the motte, enclosing a\r\nwooden tower, a ditch round the foot of the motte, with a bank on\r\nthe counterscarp, and a stepped wooden bridge, up which horses were\r\nevidently trained to climb, leading across the moat to the stockade of\r\nthe motte. In no case is the bailey distinctly depicted, but we may\r\nassume that it has been already taken, and that the horsemen are riding\r\nover it to the gate-house which (in the picture of Dinan) stands at the\r\nfoot of the bridge. The towers appear to be square, but in the case of\r\nRennes and Bayeux, are surmounted by a cupola roof. Decoration does not\r\nappear to be have been neglected, and the general appearance of the\r\nbuildings, far from being of a makeshift character, must have been very\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the building of the motte at Hastings shows only a\r\nstockade on top of the motte; this may be because the artist intended\r\nto represent the work as incomplete. What is remarkable about this\r\npicture is that the motte appears to be formed in layers of different\r\nmaterials. We might ascribe this to the fancy of the embroiderer,\r\nwere it not that layers of this kind have occasionally been found\r\nin mottes which have been excavated or destroyed. Thus the motte at\r\nCarisbrook, which was opened in 1903, was found to be composed of\r\nalternate layers of large and small chalk rubble. In some cases, layers\r\nof stones have been found; in others (as at York and Burton) a motte\r\nformed of loose material has been cased in a sort of pie-crust of\r\nheavy clay. In the Castle Hill at Hallaton in Leicestershire layers of\r\npeat and hazel branches, as well as of clay and stone boulders, were\r\nfound. But our information on this subject is too scanty to justify any\r\ngeneralisations as to the general construction of mottes.\r\n\r\nThe pictures shown in the Bayeux Tapestry agree very well with the\r\ndescription given by a 12th-century writer of the castle of Merchem,\r\nnear Dixmüde, in the life of John, Bishop of Terouenne, who died in\r\n1130. \"Bishop John used to stay frequently at Merchem when he was\r\ngoing round his diocese. Near the churchyard was an exceedingly high\r\nfortification, which might be called a castle or _municipium_, built\r\naccording to the fashion of that country by the lord of the manor many\r\nyears before. For it is the custom of the nobles of that region, who\r\nspend their time for the most part in private war, in order to defend\r\nthemselves from their enemies to make a hill of earth, as high as they\r\ncan, and encircle it with a ditch as broad and deep as possible. They\r\nsurround the upper edge of this hill with a very strong wall of hewn\r\nlogs, placing towers on the circuit, according to their means. Inside\r\nthis wall they plant their house, or keep (arcem), which overlooks\r\nthe whole thing. The entrance to this fortress is only by a bridge,\r\nwhich rises from the counterscarp of the ditch, supported on double\r\nor even triple columns, till it reaches the upper edge of the motte\r\n(agger).\"[231] The chronicler goes on to relate how this wooden bridge\r\nbroke down under the crowd of people who were following the bishop, and\r\nall fell 35 feet into the ditch, where the water was up to their knees.\r\nThere is no mention of a bailey in this account, but a bailey was so\r\nabsolutely necessary to a residential castle, in order to find room\r\nfor the stables, lodgings, barns, smithies and other workshops, which\r\nwere necessary dependencies of a feudal household, that it can seldom\r\nhave been omitted, and the comparatively rare instances which we find\r\nof mottes which appear never to have had baileys were probably outposts\r\ndependent on some more important castle.\r\n\r\nLambert of Ardres, the panegyrist of the counts of Guisnes,[232]\r\nwriting about 1194, gives us a minute and most interesting description\r\nof the wooden castle of Ardres, built about the year 1117. \"Arnold,\r\nlord of Ardres, built on the motte of Ardres a wooden house, excelling\r\nall the houses of Flanders of that period both in material and in\r\ncarpenter's work. The first storey was on the surface of the ground,\r\nwhere were cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and\r\nother domestic utensils. In the storey above were the dwelling and\r\ncommon living rooms of the residents, in which were the larders,\r\nthe rooms of the bakers and butlers, and the great chamber in which\r\nthe lord and his wife slept. Adjoining this was a private room, the\r\ndormitory of the waiting maids and children. In the inner part of the\r\ngreat chamber was a certain private room, where at early dawn or in\r\nthe evening or during sickness or at time of blood-letting, or for\r\nwarming the maids and weaned children, they used to have a fire.... In\r\nthe upper storey of the house were garret rooms, in which on the one\r\nside the sons (when they wished it) on the other side the daughters\r\n(because they were obliged) of the lord of the house used to sleep. In\r\nthis storey also the watchmen and the servants appointed to keep the\r\nhouse took their sleep at some time or other. High up on the east side\r\nof the house, in a convenient place, was the chapel, which was made\r\nlike unto the tabernacle of Solomon in its ceiling and painting. There\r\nwere stairs and passages from storey to storey, from the house into the\r\nkitchen, from room to room, and again from the house into the _loggia_\r\n(logium), where they used to sit in conversation for recreation, and\r\nagain from the loggia into the oratory.\"[233]\r\n\r\nThis description proves that these wooden castles were no mere rude\r\nsheds for temporary occupation, but that they were carefully built\r\ndwellings designed for permanent residence. The description is useful\r\nfor the light it throws on the stone keeps whose ruins remain to us.\r\nThey probably had very similar arrangements, and though only their\r\noutside walls are now existing, they must have been divided into\r\ndifferent rooms by wooden partitions which have now perished.[234]\r\n\r\nIn this account of Lambert's it is further mentioned that the kitchen\r\nwas joined to the house or keep, and was a building of two floors, the\r\nlower one being occupied by live stock, while the upper one was the\r\nactual kitchen. We must remember that this account was written at the\r\nend of the 12th century. In the earlier and simpler manners of the 11th\r\ncentury it is probable that the cooking was more generally carried on\r\nin the open air, as it was among the Anglo-Saxons.[235] The danger of\r\nfire would prevent the development of chimneys in wooden castles; we\r\nhave seen that there was only one in this wonderful castle of Ardres.\r\nBut even after stone castles became common, we have evidence that the\r\nkitchen was often an isolated building in the courtyard. One such\r\nkitchen still exists in the monastic ruins of Glastonbury.\r\n\r\nThe word _mota_, which was used in the 12th century for the artificial\r\nhills on which the wooden keeps of these castles were placed, comes\r\nfrom an old French word _motte_, meaning a clod of earth, which is\r\nstill used in France for a small earthen hillock.[236] The keep itself\r\nappears to have been called a _bretasche_, though this word seems to\r\nhave meant a wooden tower of any kind, and was used both for mural\r\ntowers and for the movable wooden towers employed for sieges.[237] At a\r\nmuch later period it was given to the wooden balconies by which walls\r\nwere defended, but the writer has found no instance of this use of the\r\nword before the 14th century. On the contrary, these wooden galleries\r\nfor the purpose of defending the foot of the walls by throwing missiles\r\ndown are called _hurdicia_ or hourdes in the documents, a word of\r\ncognate origin to our word _hoarding_.[238] The word _bretasche_ is\r\nalso of Teutonic origin, akin to the German _brett_, a board.\r\n\r\nThe court at the base of the hillock is always called the _ballium_,\r\n_bayle_, or _bailey_, a word for which Skeat suggests the Latin\r\n_baculus_, a stick, as a possible though very doubtful ancestor. The\r\nwooden wall which surrounded this court was the _palum_, _pelum_, or\r\n_palitium_ of the documents, a word which Mr Neilson has proved to be\r\nthe origin of the _peels_ so common in Lowland Scotland, though it has\r\nbeen mistakenly applied to the towers enclosed by these peels.[239]\r\nThe _palitium_ was the stockade on the inner bank of the ditch which\r\nenclosed the bailey; but the outer or counterscarp bank had also its\r\nspecial defence, called the _hericio_, from its bristling nature\r\n(French _hérisson_, a hedgehog). There can be little doubt that it\r\nwas sometimes an actual hedge of brambles, at other times of stakes\r\nintertwined with osiers or thorns.[240]\r\n\r\nThus the words most commonly used in connection with these wooden\r\ncastles are chiefly French in form, but a French that is tinctured with\r\nTeutonic blood. This is just what we might expect, since the first\r\ncastles of feudalism arose on Gallic soil (France or Flanders), but on\r\nsoil which was ruled by men of Teutonic descent. We may regard it as\r\nfairly certain that it was in the region anciently known as Neustria\r\nthat the motte-castle first appeared; and as we have previously shown,\r\nthere is some reason to think that the centre of that region was\r\nthe place where it originated. But this must for the present remain\r\ndoubtful. What we regard as certain is that it was from France, and\r\nfrom Normandy in particular, that it was introduced into the British\r\nIsles; and to those islands we must now turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLES OF THE NORMANS IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we propose to give a list, in alphabetical order for\r\nconvenience of reference, of the castles which are known to have\r\nexisted in England in the 11th century, because they are mentioned\r\neither in Domesday Book, or in charters of the period, or in some\r\ncontemporary chronicle.[241] We do not for a moment suppose that this\r\ncatalogue of eighty-four castles is a complete list of those which\r\nwere built in England in the reigns of William I. and William II. We\r\nhave little doubt that all the castles in the county towns, such as\r\nLeicester, Northampton, and Guildford, and those which we hear of first\r\nas the seats of important nobles in the reign of Henry II., such as\r\nMarlborough, Groby, Bungay, Ongar, were castles built shortly after the\r\nConquest, nearly all of them being places which have (or had) mottes.\r\nDomesday Book only mentions fifty castles in England and Wales,[242]\r\nbut it is well known that the Survey is as capricious in its mention\r\nof castles as in its mention of churches. It is possible that further\r\nresearch in charters which the writer has been unable to examine may\r\nfurnish additional castles, but the list now given may be regarded as\r\ncomplete as far as materials generally accessible will allow.[243] One\r\nof the castles mentioned (Richard's Castle) and probably two others\r\n(Hereford and Ewias) existed before the Conquest; they were the work of\r\nthose Norman friends of Edward the Confessor whom he endowed with lands\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nOut of this list of eighty-four castles we shall find that no less than\r\nseventy-one have or had mottes. The exceptions are the Tower of London,\r\nColchester, Pevensey, and Chepstow, where a stone keep was part of the\r\noriginal design, and a motte was therefore unnecessary: Bamborough,\r\nPeak, and Tynemouth, where the site was sufficiently defended by\r\nprecipices: Carlisle and Richmond, whose original design is unknown to\r\nus: Belvoir, Dover, Exeter, and Monmouth, which might on many grounds\r\nbe counted as motte-castles, but as the evidence is not conclusive,\r\nwe do not mark them as such; but even if we leave them out, with the\r\nother exceptions, we shall find that nearly 86 per cent. of our list of\r\ncastles of the 11th century are of the motte-and-bailey type.\r\n\r\nAbout forty-three of these castles are attached to towns. Of these,\r\nless than a third are placed inside the Roman walls or the Saxon or\r\nDanish earthworks of the towns, while at least two-thirds are wholly or\r\npartly outside these enclosures.[244] This circumstance is important,\r\nbecause the position outside the town indicates the mistrust of an\r\ninvader, not the confidence of a native prince. In the only two cases\r\nwhere we know anything of the position of the residence of the Saxon\r\nkings we find it in the middle of the city.[245] Even when the castle\r\nis inside the town walls it is almost invariably close to the walls, so\r\nthat an escape into the country might always be possible.[246]\r\n\r\nOf the towns or manors in which these castles were situated, Domesday\r\nBook gives us the value in King Edward's and King William's time in\r\nsixty-two instances. In forty-five cases the value has risen; in twelve\r\nit has fallen; in five it is stationary. Evidently something has caused\r\na great increase of prosperity in these cases, and it can hardly be\r\nanything else than the impetus given to trade through the security\r\nafforded by a Norman castle.\r\n\r\nOur list shows that Mr Clark's confident statement, that the moated\r\nmounds were the centres of large and important estates in Saxon times,\r\nwas a dream. Out of forty-one mottes in country districts, thirty-six\r\nare found in places which were quite insignificant in King Edward's\r\nday, and only five can be said to occupy the centres of important Saxon\r\nmanors.[247]\r\n\r\nIn the table in the Appendix, the area occupied by the original\r\nbaileys of the castles in this list has been measured accurately by a\r\nplanimeter, from the 25-in. Ordnance maps, in all cases in which that\r\nwas possible.[248] This table proves that the early Norman castles\r\nwere very small in area, suitable only for the personal defence of a\r\nchieftain who had only a small force at his disposal, and absolutely\r\nunsuited for a people in the tribal state of development, like the\r\nancient Britons, or for the scheme of national defence inaugurated by\r\nAlfred and Edward. We may remark here that in not a single case is any\r\nmasonry which is certainly early Norman to be found on one of these\r\nmottes; where the date can be ascertained, the stonework is invariably\r\nlater than the 11th century.\r\n\r\nABERGAVENNY (Fig. 8).--This castle, being in Monmouthshire, must be\r\nincluded in our list. The earliest notice of it is a document stating\r\nthat Hamelin de Ballon gave the church and chapel of the castle of\r\nAbergavenny, and the land for making a _bourg_, and an oven of their\r\nown, to the Abbey of St Vincent at Le Mans.[249]\r\n\r\nThe castle occupies a pointed spur at the S. end of the town, whose\r\nwalls converge so as to include the castle as part of the defence.\r\nThe motte has been much altered during recent years, and is crowned\r\nby a modern building; but a plan in _Coxe's Tour in Monmouthshire_,\r\n1800, shows it in its original round form. The bailey is roughly of a\r\npentagonal shape, covering 1 acre, and is defended by a curtain wall\r\nwith mural towers and a gatehouse. The ditch on the W. and N. is much\r\nfilled in and obscured by the encroachment of the town. On the E.\r\nthe ground descends in a steep scarp, which merges into those of the\r\nheadland on which the motte is placed.[250]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Arundel, Sussex. Abergavenny, Monmouth.]\r\n\r\nARUNDEL (Fig. 8).--\"The castrum of Arundel,\" says Domesday Book, \"paid\r\n40_s._ in King Edward's time from a certain mill, and 20_s._ from\r\nthree boardlands (or feorm-lands), and 2_s._ from one pasture. Now,\r\nbetween the town feorm and the water-gate and the ships' dues, it pays\r\n12_l._\"[251] _Castrum_ in Domesday nearly always means a castle; yet\r\nthe description here given is certainly that of a town and not of a\r\ncastle. We must therefore regard it as an instance of the fluctuating\r\nmeaning which both _castrum_ and _castellum_ had in the 11th\r\ncentury.[252] Arundel is one of the towns mentioned in the \"Burghal\r\nHidage.\"[253] But even accepting that the description in Domesday\r\nrefers to the town, we can have very little doubt that the original\r\nearthen castle was reared by Roger de Montgomeri, to whom William\r\nI. gave the Rapes of Arundel and Chichester, and whom he afterwards\r\nmade Earl of Shrewsbury.[254] Roger had contributed sixty ships to\r\nWilliam's fleet, and both he and his sons were highly favoured and\r\ntrusted by William, until the sons forfeited that confidence. We shall\r\nsee afterwards that their names are connected with several important\r\ncastles of the early Norman settlement. We shall see also that the\r\nRapes into which Sussex was divided--Chichester, Arundel, Bramber,\r\nLewes, Pevensey, and Hastings--were all furnished with Norman castles,\r\neach with the characteristic motte, except Pevensey, which had a stone\r\nkeep. Each of these castles, at the time of the Survey, defended a port\r\nby which direct access could be had to Normandy. It was to protect his\r\nbase that William fortified these important estuaries, and committed\r\nthem to the keeping of some of the most prominent of the Norman leaders.\r\n\r\nThe castle stands on the end of a high and narrow ridge of the South\r\nDowns, above the town of Arundel. It consists of an oblong ward,\r\ncovering 4-1/2 acres, in the middle of which, but on the line of the\r\nwest wall, is a large motte, about 70 feet high, surrounded by its own\r\nditch. The lower and perhaps original bailey is only 2 acres in extent.\r\nRound the top of the motte is a slightly oval wall, of the kind called\r\nby Mr Clark a shell keep. We have elsewhere expressed our doubts of\r\nthe correctness of this term.[255] In all the more important castles\r\nwe find that the keep on top of the motte has a small ward attached to\r\nit, and Arundel is no exception to this rule; it has the remains of a\r\ntower, as well as the wall round the motte. The tower is a small one,\r\nbut it is large enough for the king's chamber in times which were not\r\nextravagant in domestic architecture. It is probable that this tower,\r\nand the stone wall round the motte are the work of Henry II., as he\r\nspent nearly 340_l._ on this castle between the years 1170 and 1187.\r\nHis work consisted chiefly of a wall, a king's chamber, a chapel, and\r\na tower.[256] The wall of the motte corresponds in style to the work\r\nof the middle of his reign; it is built of flints, but cased with Caen\r\nstone brought from Normandy, and has Norman buttresses. The original\r\nNorman doorway on the south side (now walled up) has the chevron\r\nmoulding, which shows that it is not earlier than the 12th century.\r\nThe tower, which we may assume to be the tower of Henry II.'s records,\r\nhas a round arched entrance, and contains a chapel and a chamber (now\r\nruined) besides a well chamber.\r\n\r\nThere is earlier Norman work still remaining in the bailey, namely,\r\nthe fine gateway, which though of plain and severe Norman, is larger\r\nand loftier than the early work of that style, and of superior\r\nmasonry.[257] The one Pipe Roll of Henry I. which we possess shows that\r\nhe spent 78_l._ 6_s._ 2_d._ on the castle in 1130, and possibly this\r\nrefers to this gatehouse.[258] We know that Henry was a great builder,\r\nbut so was the former owner of this castle, Robert Belesme, son of\r\nRoger de Montgomeri.\r\n\r\nThe value of the town of Arundel had greatly increased since the\r\nConquest, at the time of the Domesday Survey.[259]\r\n\r\nBAMBOROUGH, Northumberland.--We first hear of this castle in the reign\r\nof Rufus, when it was defended against the king by Robert Mowbray, the\r\nrebel Earl of Northumberland; but there can be little doubt that the\r\nearliest castle on this natural bastion was built in the Conqueror's\r\nreign. In the 13th century certain lands were held by the tenure of\r\nsupplying wood to the castle of Bamborough, and it was declared that\r\nthis obligation had existed ever since the time of William I.[260]\r\nWilliam certainly found no castle there, for Bamborough had fallen\r\ninto utter ruin and desolation by the middle of the 11th century.[261]\r\nWilliam's hold on Northumberland was too precarious to give opportunity\r\nfor so long and costly a work as the building of a stone keep. It is\r\nmore probable that a strong wooden castle was the fortress of the\r\ngovernors of Northumberland under the first Norman kings, and that\r\nthe present stone keep was built in Henry II.'s reign.[262] There is\r\nno motte at Bamborough, nor was one needed on a site which is itself\r\na natural motte, more precipitous and defensible than any artificial\r\nhill.[263] As the Domesday Survey does not extend to Northumberland, we\r\nhave no statement of the value of Bamborough. The area of the castle is\r\n4-3/4 acres.\r\n\r\nBARNSTAPLE, Devon (Fig. 9).--This castle is not mentioned in Domesday,\r\nbut the town belonged to Judhael, one of the followers of the\r\nConqueror, whose name suggests a Breton origin. William gave him large\r\nestates in Devon and Cornwall. A charter of Judhael's to the priory\r\nwhich he founded at Barnstaple makes mention of the castle.[264]\r\nBarnstaple, at the head of the estuary of the Taw, was a borough at\r\nDomesday, and the castle was placed inside the town walls.[265] The\r\nmotte remains in good condition; the winding walks which now lead to\r\nthe top are certainly no part of the original plan, but are generally\r\nfound in cases where the motte has been incorporated in a garden. There\r\nwas formerly a stone keep, of which no vestige remains.[266] The castle\r\nseems to have formed the apex of a town of roughly triangular shape.\r\nThe bailey can just be traced, and must have covered 1-1/3 acres.\r\n\r\nThe former value of Barnstaple is not given in the Survey, so we cannot\r\ntell whether it had risen or not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Barnstaple, Devon. Bishop's Stortford, Herts.\r\nBerkhampstead, Herts.]\r\n\r\nBELVOIR, Leicester.--This castle was founded by the Norman Robert\r\nde Todeni, who died in 1088.[267] It stands on a natural hill, so\r\nsteep and isolated that it might be called a natural motte. The first\r\ncastle was destroyed by King John, and the modernising of the site has\r\nentirely destroyed any earthworks which may have existed on the hill.\r\nThere appears to have been a shell wall, from the descriptions\r\ngiven by Nicholls and Leland.[268] It was situated in the manor of\r\nBottesdene, a manor of no great importance, but which had risen in\r\nvalue at the date of the Survey.[269]\r\n\r\nBERKELEY, or NESS.--The identity of Berkeley Castle with the Ness\r\ncastle of Domesday may be regarded as certain. All that the Survey says\r\nabout it is: \"In Ness there are five hides belonging to Berkeley, which\r\nEarl William put out to make a little castle.\"[270] Earl William is\r\nWilliam FitzOsbern, the trusty friend and counsellor of the Conqueror,\r\nwho had made him Earl of Herefordshire. He had also authority over the\r\nnorth and west of England during William's first absence in Normandy,\r\nand part of the commission he received from William was to build\r\ncastles where they were needed.[271] Berkeley was a royal manor with\r\na large number of berewicks, and the probable meaning of the passage\r\nin Domesday is that Earl William removed the _geldability_ of the\r\nfive hides occupying the peninsula or _ness_ which stretches from\r\nBerkeley to the Severn, bounded on the south by the Little Avon, and\r\nappropriated these lands to the upkeep of a small castle. This castle\r\ncan hardly have been placed anywhere but at Berkeley, for there is\r\nno trace of any other castle in the district.[272] Earl Godwin had\r\nsometimes resided at Berkeley, but probably his residence there was the\r\nmonastery which by evil means had come into his hands;[273] for we\r\nnever hear of any castle in connection with Godwin. But a Norman motte\r\nexists at Berkeley, though buried in the stone shell built by Henry II.\r\nMr Clark remarks: \"If the masonry of Berkeley Castle were removed, its\r\nremains would show a mound of earth, and attached to three sides of it\r\na platform, the whole encircled with a ditch or scarp.\"[274] The motte\r\nraised by Earl William has, in fact, been revetted with a stone shell\r\nof the 12th century, whose bold chevron ornament over the entrance\r\ngives evidence of its epoch. What is still more remarkable is that\r\ndocumentary evidence exists to fix the date of this transformation.\r\nA charter of Henry II. is preserved at Berkeley Castle, in which he\r\ngrants the manor to Robert Fitzhardinge, pledging himself at the same\r\ntime to fortify a castle there, according to Robert's wish.[275]\r\nRobert's wish probably was to possess a stone keep, like those which\r\nhad been rising in so many places during the 12th century. But there\r\nhad been a Norman lord at Berkeley before Fitzhardinge, Roger de\r\nBerkeley, whose representatives only lost the manor through having\r\ntaken sides with Stephen in the civil war.[276] This Roger no doubt\r\noccupied the wooden castle on the motte built by William FitzOsbern.\r\nHenry II.'s shell was probably the first masonry connected with the\r\ncastle. This remarkable keep is nearly circular, and has three round\r\nturrets and one oblong. As the latter, Thorpe's Tower, was rebuilt in\r\nEdward III.'s reign, it probably took the place of a round tower. The\r\nkeep is built of rubble, and its Norman buttresses (it has several\r\nlater ones) project about a foot. The cross loopholes in the walls are\r\nundoubtedly insertions of the time of Edward III. The buildings in the\r\nbailey are chiefly of the time of Edward III., but the bailey walls\r\nhave some Norman buttresses, and are probably of the same date as the\r\nkeep.[277] This bailey is nearly square, and the motte, which is in one\r\ncorner, encroaches upon about a quarter of it. The small size of the\r\narea which it encloses, not much more than half an acre, corresponds to\r\nthe statement of Domesday Book that it was \"a little castle.\" There is\r\nno trace of the usual ditch surrounding the motte, and the smallness of\r\nthe bailey makes it unlikely that there ever was one. A second bailey\r\nhas been added to the first,[278] and the whole is surrounded on three\r\nsides by a moat, the fourth side having formerly had a steep descent\r\ninto swamps, which formed sufficient protection.[279]\r\n\r\nThere is no statement in the Survey of the value of Ness, but the whole\r\nmanor of Berkeley had risen since the Conquest.[280]\r\n\r\nBERKHAMPSTEAD, Herts (Fig. 9).--Mr D. H. Montgomerie rightly calls\r\nthis a magnificent example of an earthwork fortress.[281] It is first\r\nmentioned in a charter of Richard I., which recapitulates the original\r\ncharter of William, son of Robert, Count of Mortain, in which he gives\r\nthe chapel of this castle to the Abbey of Grestein in Normandy.[282]\r\nWe may, therefore, with all probability look upon this as one of the\r\ncastles built by the Conqueror's half-brother. And this will account\r\nfor the exceptional strength of the work, which comprises a motte 40\r\nfeet high, ditched round (formerly), and a bailey of 2-2/3 acres,\r\nsurrounded not only with the usual ditch and banks, but with a second\r\nditch outside the counterscarp bank, which encircles both motte and\r\nbailey. At two important points in its line, this counterscarp bank\r\nis enlarged into mounds which have evidently once carried wooden\r\ntowers;[283] if this arrangement belonged to the original plan, as it\r\nmost probably did, it confirms a remark which we have made elsewhere as\r\nto the early use of wooden mural towers. Works in masonry were added to\r\nthe motte and the bailey banks in the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries.\r\nThere are traces of a semicircular earthwork outside the second ditch\r\non the west, which appears to have formed a barbican. But the most\r\nexceptional thing about this castle is the series of earthen platforms\r\non the north and east, connected by a bank, and closely investing\r\nthe external ditch, which were formerly supposed to form part of the\r\ncastle works. Mr W. St John Hope has suggested the far more plausible\r\ntheory that they were the siege platforms erected by Louis, the Dauphin\r\nof France, in 1216. We are told that his engines kept up a most\r\ndestructive fire of stones.[284]\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Berkhampstead had considerably decreased,\r\neven since the Count of Mortain received it.[285]\r\n\r\nBISHOP'S STORTFORD, Herts (Fig. 9).--Waytemore Castle is the name given\r\nto the large oval motte at this place, which is evidently the site of\r\nthe castle of \"Estorteford,\" given by William the Conqueror to Maurice,\r\nBishop of London.[286] The manor of Stortford had been bought from King\r\nWilliam by Maurice's predecessor, William, who had been one of the\r\nNorman favourites of Edward the Confessor.[287] He may have built this\r\ncastle, but he cannot have built it till after the Conquest, as the\r\nland did not belong to his see till then.\r\n\r\n\"The castle consists of a large oval motte, 250 × 200 feet at its base,\r\nrising 40 feet above the marshes of the river Stort, and crowned by\r\na keep with walls of flint rubble, 12 feet thick. On the S. of the\r\nmotte there are traces of a pentagonal bailey, covering 2-1/2 acres.\r\nIt is enclosed on four sides by the narrow streams which intersect\r\nthe marshes. The dry ditch on the fifth side, facing the motte, is\r\ndiscernible. The castle abuts on the road called The Causeway, which\r\ncrosses the valley; it is in a good position to command both road and\r\nriver.\"[288] The value of the manor had gone down at Domesday.[289]\r\n\r\nBOURN, Lincolnshire (Fig. 10).--The manor of Bourn or Brune appears to\r\nhave been much split up amongst various owners at the time of Domesday.\r\nA Breton named Oger held the demesne.[290] A charter of Picot, the\r\nSheriff of Cambridgeshire, a person often mentioned in Domesday Book,\r\ngives the church of Brune and the chapel of the castle to the priory\r\nwhich he had founded near the castle of Cambridge--afterwards removed\r\nto Barnwell.[291] Bourn was the centre of a large soke in Anglo-Saxon\r\ntimes. Leland mentions the \"Grete Diches, and the Dungeon Hill of the\r\nancient Castel,\"[292] but very little of the remains is now visible,\r\nand the motte has been almost removed.\r\n\r\n\"The castle lies in flat ground, well watered by springs and streams.\r\nThe motte was placed at the southern apex of a roughly oval bailey,\r\nfrom which it was separated by its own wet ditch, access being obtained\r\nthrough a gatehouse which stood on the narrow neck by which this\r\ninnermost enclosure, at its N.W. end, joined the principal bailey,\r\nwhich, in its turn, was embraced on all sides but the S. by a second\r\nand concentric bailey, also defended by a wet ditch, which broadens out\r\nat the S.W. corner into St Peter's Pool. There is another enclosure\r\nbeyond this which may be of later date. The inner bailey covers 3\r\nacres. Very little is now left of the motte, but a plan made in 1861\r\nshowed it to be fairly perfect,[293] and some slight remains of the\r\ngatehouse were excavated in that year. The castle is on the line of\r\nthe Roman road from Peterborough to Sleaford, and close to the Roman\r\nCar-Dyke.\"[294]\r\n\r\nThe value of Bourn had risen at Domesday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Bourn, Lincs. Bramber, Sussex.]\r\n\r\nBRAMBER, Sussex (Fig. 10).--Of the manor of Washington, in which\r\nBramber is situated, the Survey says that it formerly paid geld\r\nfor fifty-nine hides; and in one of these hides sits the castle of\r\nBramber.[295] It must not be imagined that the castle _occupied_ a\r\nwhole hide, which according to the latest computations would average\r\nabout 120 acres. It is evident that there had been some special\r\narrangement between the King and William de Braose, the Norman\r\ntenant-in-chief, by which the whole geld of the manor had been\r\nremitted. The Domesday scribe waxes almost pathetic over the loss to\r\nthe fisc of this valuable prey. \"It used to be ad firmam for 100_l._,\"\r\nhe says. The manor of Washington belonged to Gurth, the brother of\r\nHarold, before the Conquest, but it is clear that Bramber was not the\r\n_caput_ of the manor in Saxon times; nor was Washington the centre of a\r\nlarge soke. Bramber Castle was constructed to defend the estuary of the\r\nriver, now known as the Adur, one of the waterways to Normandy already\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\nThe castle occupies a natural hill which forms on the top a pear-shaped\r\narea of 3 acres. Towards the middle rises an artificial motte about 30\r\nfeet high; there is no sign of a special ditch around it, except that\r\nthe ground sinks slightly at its base. The bailey is surrounded by a\r\nvery neatly built wall of pebbles and flints, laid herring-bone-wise in\r\nplaces, which does not stand on an earthen bank. The absence of this\r\nbank makes it likely, though of course not certain, that this wall was\r\nthe original work of De Braose; the stones of which it is composed\r\nwould be almost as easily obtained as the earth for a bank. On the\r\nline of the wall, just east of the entrance, stands a tall fragment of\r\nan early Norman tower. The workmanship of this tower, which is also\r\nof flints laid herring-bone-wise, with quoins of ashlar, so strongly\r\nresembles that of the neighbouring church that it seems obvious that\r\nboth were built at about the same time.[296] The church is dedicated to\r\nSt Nicholas, who was worshipped in Normandy as early as 1067;[297] it\r\nwas probably the Normans who introduced his worship into England. Both\r\nchurch and tower are undoubtedly early Norman. The motte shows no sign\r\nof masonry.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Washington had slightly risen since the\r\nConquest.\r\n\r\nBRISTOL.--Robert, Earl of Gloucester, the Empress Matilda's half-brother\r\nand great champion, is always credited with the building of Bristol\r\nCastle; but this is one of the many instances in which the man who\r\nfirst rebuilds a castle in stone receives the credit of being the\r\noriginal founder.[298] For it is certain that there was a castle at\r\nBristol long before the days of Earl Robert, as the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_ mentions it in 1088, when it was held by Geoffrey, Bishop\r\nof Coutances, and Robert Curthose against William II.; and Symeon of\r\nDurham, in the same year, speaks of it as a \"castrum fortissimum.\"\r\nBishop Geoffrey held Bristol at the date of the Domesday Survey,\r\nand he probably built the castle by William's orders.[299] It was\r\ncompletely destroyed in 1655 (only a few 13th century arches in a\r\nprivate house now remain), and no trustworthy plan has been preserved,\r\nbut there is clear evidence that it was a motte-and-bailey castle of\r\nthe usual Norman type.[300] In Stephen's reign it was described as\r\nstanding on a very great _agger_.[301] An _agger_ does not necessarily\r\nmean a motte, but it is often used for one, and there is other\r\nevidence which shows that this is its meaning here. A Perambulation\r\nof the bounds of Bristol in 1373 shows that the south-western part\r\nof the castle ditch, which enclosed the site of the keep, was called\r\n_le Mot-dich_; which should certainly be translated the ditch of the\r\nmotte, and not, as Seyer translates it, the moat ditch.[302] Finally,\r\nthe description of the castle in 1642 by Major Wood, says: \"The castle\r\nstood upon a lofty steep mount, that was not minable, as Lieutenant\r\nClifton informed me, for he said the mount whereon the castle stood\r\nwas of an earthy substance for a certain depth, but below that a firm\r\nstrong rock, and that he had searched purposely with an auger and found\r\nit so in all parts.\"[303] He goes on to describe the wall of the bailey\r\nas resting on an earthen rampart, testifying to the wooden stockade of\r\nthe first castle. The great tower of Earl Robert appears to have been\r\nplaced on the motte, which must have been of considerable size, as it\r\nheld not only the keep, but a courtyard, a chapel, and the constable's\r\nhouse, besides several towers on its walls. The whole area of the\r\ncastle was very nearly 4 acres.[304]\r\n\r\nBristol Castle was no doubt originally a royal castle, though Earl\r\nRobert of Gloucester held it in right of his wife, who had inherited it\r\nfrom her father, Robert Fitz Hamon; but the crown did not abdicate its\r\nclaim upon it, and after the troubles of 1174, Henry II. caused the son\r\nof Earl Robert to surrender the keep into his hands.[305]\r\n\r\nSeyer very pertinently remarks that Bristol Castle \"was erected with a\r\ndesign hostile to the town; for it occupies the peninsula between two\r\nrivers, along which was the direct and original communication between\r\nthe town and the main part of Gloucestershire.\"[306] It was outside the\r\ncity, and was not under its jurisdiction till James I. granted this\r\nauthority by charter.[307] The value T. R. E. is not given in Domesday\r\nBook.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.--The only mention of this castle as existing in the 11th\r\ncentury is in the _Gesta Herewardi_,[308] an undated work which is\r\ncertainly in great part a romance, but as it is written by some one\r\nwho evidently had local knowledge, we may probably trust him for the\r\nexistence of Buckingham Castle at that date; especially as Buckingham\r\nwas a county town, and one of the boroughs of the Burghal Hidage, the\r\nvery place which we should expect to find occupied by a Norman castle.\r\nThis writer speaks of the castle as belonging to Ivo de Taillebois;\r\nthis is not inconsistent with the fact shown by Domesday Book, that\r\nthe borough belonged to the king. That it was a motte-and-bailey\r\ncastle is indicated by Speed's map of Buckingham in 1611; he speaks\r\nof the \"high hill,\" though he only indicates it slightly in his plan,\r\nwith a shield-shaped bailey. Brayley states that the present church\r\nis \"proudly exalted on the summit of an artificial mount, anciently\r\noccupied by a castle.\"[309]\r\n\r\nThe castle hill occupies a strong position on the neck of land made\r\nby a bend of the river; it extends nearly half-way across it, and\r\ncommands both town and river. The original earthworks of the castle\r\nwere destroyed and levelled for the erection of a church in 1777, but\r\nthe large oval hill remains, having a flat summit about 2 acres in\r\nextent, and about 30 feet above the town below. Its sides descend in\r\nsteep scarps behind the houses on all sides but the north-east. There\r\ncan be no doubt that the motte has been lowered, and thus enlarged, in\r\norder to build the church. The foundations of a stone castle were found\r\nin digging a cellar on the slope of the motte.[310]\r\n\r\nThe value of Buckingham had considerably risen at the date of\r\nDomesday.[311]\r\n\r\nCAERLEON, Monmouthshire (Fig. 11).--Domesday Book speaks of the\r\n_castellaria_ of Caerleon.[312] A _castellaria_ appears to have meant\r\na district in which the land was held by the service of castle-guard\r\nin a neighbouring castle. The Survey goes on to say that this land was\r\nwaste in the time of King Edward, and when William de Scohies, the\r\nDomesday tenant, received it; _now_ it is worth 40s. _Wasta_, Mr Round\r\nhas remarked, is one of the pitfalls of the Survey. Perhaps we shall\r\nnot be far wrong if we say that in a general way it means that there\r\nwas nobody there to pay geld. When this occurs in a town it may point\r\nto the devastations committed at the Conquest; but when it occurs in\r\nthe country, and when it is accompanied by so clear a statement that\r\nthe land which was _wasta_ in King Edward's time and at the Conquest is\r\nnow producing revenue, the inference would seem to be clear that the\r\ncastle of Caerleon was built on uninhabited land. Caerleon, however,\r\nhad been a great city in Roman times, and had kept up its importance\r\nat least till the days of Edgar, when it is twice mentioned in Welsh\r\nhistory.[313] It must therefore have gone downhill very rapidly.\r\nGiraldus mentions among the ruins of Roman greatness which were to be\r\nseen in his day, a gigantic tower, and this is commonly supposed to\r\nhave belonged to the castle.[314] It certainly did not, for Giraldus is\r\nclearly speaking of a Roman tower, and the motte of the Norman castle\r\nnot only has no signs of masonry, but has been thrown up over the ruins\r\nof a Roman villa which had been burnt.[315] The motte and other remains\r\nof the castle are outside the Roman _castrum_, between it and the\r\nriver. The bailey is roughly pentagonal, and covers 4-3/4 acres. The\r\nmanor of Caerleon was waste T. R. E. and had risen to 40s. T. R. W.[316]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Caerleon, Monmouth. Carisbrooke.]\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE.--Ordericus tells us that William built this castle on his\r\nreturn from his first visit to Yorkshire in 1068,[317] and Domesday\r\nBook states that twenty-seven houses were destroyed to make room for\r\nthe castle.[318] There can hardly be a clearer statement that the\r\ncastle was entirely new. We have already seen that there is some\r\nprobability that Cambridge was first fortified by the Danes; for though\r\nit has been assumed to be a Roman castrum, no Roman remains have\r\never been found there, and the names which suggest Roman occupation,\r\nChesterton and Grantchester, are at some distance from Cambridge. The\r\ncastle, according to Mr St John Hope's plan,[319] was placed inside\r\nthis enclosure, and the destruction of the houses to make room for it\r\nis thus explained. The motte and a portion of the bank of the bailey\r\nare all that now remain of the castle, but the valuable ancient maps\r\nrepublished by Mr Hope show that the motte had its own ditch, and\r\nthat the bailey was rectangular. There was formerly a round tower on\r\nthe motte, which, if it had the cross-loop-holes and machicolations\r\nrepresented in the print published in 1575, was certainly not of Norman\r\ndate. The area of the bailey was 4-1/4 acres.[320] The castle was a\r\nroyal one, and like many royal castles, went early to ruin. Henry IV.\r\ngave the materials of the hall to the master and wardens of King's Hall\r\nfor building their chapel.\r\n\r\nThe value of Cambridge T. R. W. is not given in Domesday Book.\r\n\r\nCANTERBURY.--Domesday Book only mentions this castle incidentally\r\nin connection with an exchange of land: \"The archbishop has seven\r\nhouses and the abbot of St Augustine fourteen for the exchange of\r\nthe castle.\"[321] It has been too hastily assumed that it was a\r\npre-Conquest castle which was thus exchanged for twenty-one houses;\r\nbut anyone who knows the kind of relations which existed chronically\r\nbetween the archbishop of Canterbury and the abbot of St Augustine's\r\nwill perceive that it was an impossibility that these two potentates\r\nshould have held a castle in common. It was the land for the castle,\r\nnot the castle itself, which the king got from these ecclesiastics.\r\nThis is rendered clear by a passage in the Chartulary of St Augustine's,\r\nwhich tells us that the king, who was mesne lord of the city of\r\nCanterbury, had lost the rent of thirty-two houses through the exchange\r\nof the castle: seven having gone to the archbishop, fourteen to the\r\nabbot, and eleven having been destroyed in making the ditch of the\r\ncastle.[322] There can scarcely be any doubt that the hillock now known\r\nby the ridiculous name of Dane John is the motte of this original\r\ncastle of the Conqueror. Its proper name, the Dungeon Hill, which it\r\nbore till the 16th and even the 18th century,[323] shows what its\r\norigin was; it was the hill on which stood the dungeon or donjon of\r\na Norman castle.[324] The name Dane John is not so much a corruption\r\nas a deliberate perversion introduced by the antiquary Somner about\r\n1640, under the idea that the Danes threw up the hill--an idea for\r\nwhich there is not the slightest historical evidence.[325] We have\r\nseen that there is no reason to think that the Danes ever constructed\r\nfortifications of this kind, and their connection with this earthwork\r\nis due to one of those guesses, too common in English archæology, which\r\nhave no scientific basis whatever.\r\n\r\nSomner makes the important statement that this earthwork was originally\r\noutside the city walls. His words are:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am persuaded (and so may easily, I think, anyone be that well\r\n    observes the place) that the works both within and without the\r\n    present wall of the city were not counterworks one against the\r\n    other, as the vulgar opinion goes, but were sometimes all one\r\n    entire plot containing about 3 acres of ground, of a triangular\r\n    form (the outwork) with a mount or hill entrenched round within it;\r\n    and that when first made or cast up it lay wholly without the city\r\n    wall; and hath been (the hill or mount, and most part also of the\r\n    outwork), for the city's more security, taken in and walled since;\r\n    that side of the trench encompassing the mound now lying without\r\n    and under the wall fitly meeting with the rest of the city ditch,\r\n    after either side of the earthwork was cut through to make way for\r\n    it, at the time of the city's inditching.\"[326]\r\n\r\nIt is not often we are so fortunate as to have so clear a description\r\nof an earthwork which has almost entirely disappeared; but the\r\ndescription is confirmed by Stukeley and Hasted, and down to the making\r\nof the Chatham and Dover railway in 1860 the earthworks of the part of\r\nthe bailey which was left outside the city wall were still to be seen,\r\nand were noticed by Mr G. T. Clark.[327] It is clear that Somner's\r\ndescription corresponds exactly, even in the detail of size, to the\r\ntype of a motte-and-bailey castle.\r\n\r\nThere are certain facts, which have not been put together before,\r\nwhich enable us to make a very probable guess as to the date at which\r\nthis ancient castle was cut through by the newer city bank. The walls\r\nof Canterbury have never yet received so careful an examination as\r\nthose of Rochester have had from the Rev. Greville Livett;[328] but\r\nthe researches of Mr Pilbrow about thirty years ago showed that the\r\noriginal Roman walls included a very small area, which would leave\r\nboth the motte and the Plantagenet castle outside.[329] Certain\r\nentries in the _Close Rolls_ show that the fortification of the town\r\nof Canterbury was going on in the years 1215-1225.[330] But it is\r\ntoo often forgotten that where a wall stands on an earthen bank it\r\nis a clear proof that before the wall was built there was a wooden\r\nstockade in its place. Now the portion of the city wall which encloses\r\nthe Dane John stands on an earthen bank; so, indeed, does the whole\r\nwall from the Northgate to the castle. It is clear that this piece of\r\nbank cannot have been made till the first Norman castle, represented\r\nby the earthwork, was abandoned; and fortunately we have some evidence\r\nwhich suggests a date for the change. In the _Pipe Rolls_ of Henry\r\nII.'s reign there are yearly entries, beginning in 1168, of 5s. paid to\r\nAdeliza Fitzsimon \"for the exchange of her land which is in the castle\r\nof Canterbury.\" There can be little doubt that this land was purchased\r\nto build the great Plantagenet castle whose splendid keep was once one\r\nof the finest in England.[331] The portion of the castle wall which\r\ncan still be seen does not stand on an earthen bank, an indication\r\n(though not a proof) that the castle was on a new site. Henry II. was a\r\ngreat builder of stone keeps, but he seldom placed them on artificial\r\nmottes. It is no uncommon thing to find an old motte-and-bailey castle\r\nabandoned for a better or larger site close at hand.[332]\r\n\r\nThe bailey of the second castle, according to Hasted, extended almost\r\nto the Dane John, which is about 800 feet from the present keep. The\r\npart of the older castle which lay outside the new city bank was\r\npossessed by a family of the name of Chiche from the time of Henry\r\nII. to that of Edward IV., while the Dungeon Hill itself remained\r\nroyal property.[333] That the new bank was Henry II.'s work we may\r\nconjecture from the passages in the _Pipe Rolls_, which show that\r\nbetween the years 1166 and 1173 he spent about £30 in enclosing the\r\ncity of Canterbury and making a gate. We are therefore not without\r\ngrounds for concluding that Henry II. was the first to enlarge the city\r\nby taking in the Dane John, cutting through the ancient bailey, and at\r\nthe same time enclosing a piece of land for a new stone castle.[334]\r\nThe very small sum paid for the city gate (11s., equal to about £11\r\nof our money) suggests that the gate put up by Henry II. was a wooden\r\ngateway in the new stockaded bank. The stone walls and towers which\r\nwere afterwards placed on the bank are of much later date than his\r\nreign.[335]\r\n\r\nThe Dungeon Hill appears to have been used for the last time as a\r\nfortification in 1643, when ordnance was placed upon it, and it\r\nwas ordered to be guarded by the householders.[336] In 1790 it was\r\nconverted into a pleasure-ground for the city; the wide and deep ditch\r\nwhich had surrounded it was filled up, and serpentine walks cut to\r\nlead up to the summit. Brayley says that \"the ancient and venerable\r\ncharacter of this eminence was wholly destroyed by incongruous\r\nadditions.\" Still, enough remains to show that it was once a very fine\r\nmotte, such as we might expect the Conqueror to raise to hold in check\r\none of the most important cities of his new realm.\r\n\r\nThe value of Canterbury had increased from 51_l._ to 54_l._ since the\r\ndays of King Edward.[337]\r\n\r\nCARISBROOKE, Isle of Wight (Fig. 11).--There can be no doubt that\r\nthis is the castle spoken of in Domesday Book under the manor of\r\nAlwinestone. Carisbrooke is in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nAlvington. The language in which the Survey speaks of this manor is\r\nworthy of note. \"The king holds Alwinestone: Donnus held it. It then\r\npaid geld as two and a half hides: now as two hides, because the castle\r\nsits in one virgate.\"[338] Certain entries similar to this in other\r\nplaces seem to indicate that there was some remission of geld granted\r\non the building of a castle;[339] but as here the king was himself the\r\nowner, the remission must have been granted to his tenants.\r\n\r\nThe original castle of Carisbrooke consists of a high motte, ditched\r\nround, placed at the corner of a parallelogram with rounded corners.\r\nThis bailey, covering 2-3/4 acres, is surrounded by high banks, which\r\ntestify to the former presence of a wooden stockade. There is another\r\nbailey on the eastern side, called the Tilt-yard. The excellent little\r\nlocal guide-book compiled by Mr Stone calls this a British camp, but\r\nthere is no reason to believe that it was anything else than what it\r\nappears to be--a second bailey added as the castle grew in importance.\r\nOn the motte is a shell of polygonal form, of rubble masonry, but\r\nhaving quoins of well-dressed ashlar. It is believed to be of the time\r\nof Henry I., since the author of the _Gesta Stephani_ states that\r\nBaldwin de Redvers, son of Richard de Redvers, to whom Henry granted\r\nthe lordship of the Isle of Wight, had a castle there splendidly\r\nbuilt of stone, defended by a strong fortification.[340] This would\r\nindicate that, besides the stone keep, stone walls were added to the\r\nearthworks of the Domesday castle. The keep is of peculiar interest,\r\nas it still retains the remains of the old arrangements in keeps of\r\nthis style, though of much later date. The motte was opened in 1893,\r\nand was found to be composed of alternate layers of large and small\r\nchalk rubble.[341] Little attention has hitherto been paid to the\r\nconstruction of these Norman mottes, but other instances have been\r\nnoted which show that they were often built with great care. The whole\r\ncastle, including the Tilt-yard, was surrounded with an elaborate\r\npolygonal fortification in Elizabeth's reign, when the Spanish invasion\r\nwas expected.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Alvington had increased at the time of the\r\nSurvey, though the number of ploughs employed had actually decreased.\r\nThis increase must have been owing to the erection of the castle, which\r\nprovided security for trade and agriculture. Alvington was not the\r\ncentre of a large soke in the Confessor's time, so it is unlikely that\r\nthere was any fortification there in Saxon days.[342]\r\n\r\nCARLISLE, Cumberland (FIG. 12).--This castle was built by William Rufus\r\nin 1092, when for the first time Cumberland was brought under Norman\r\nsway. The _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ says, \"he repaired the _burh_, and\r\nreared the castle,\" a passage which is sufficient of itself to show\r\nthat _burh_ and castle were two quite different things. Carlisle of\r\ncourse was a Roman fortress, and needed only the repairing of its\r\nwalls. The castle was a new thing, and was placed outside the city. Its\r\nplan, which is roughly a triangle, with the apex formed into a small\r\ncourt by a ditch which (formerly) separated it from the bailey, looks\r\nvery suggestive of a previous motte and bailey, such as we might expect\r\nthe Norman king to have thrown up. The keep is known to have been built\r\nby David, king of Scotland, in Stephen's reign,[343] and it is possible\r\nthat he may have removed the motte. The castle appears to have had a\r\nwooden _pelum_ or _palicium_ on its outer banks as late as 1319.[344]\r\nThe whole area covers 4 acres.\r\n\r\nCASTLE ACRE, Norfolk (Fig. 12).--There can be no doubt that this castle\r\nexisted in the 11th century, as William de Warenne mentions it in the\r\ncharter of foundation of Lewes Priory, one of the most interesting and\r\nhuman of monastic charters.[345] The earthworks still remaining of\r\nthis castle are perhaps the finest castle earthworks in England; the\r\nbanks enclosing the bailey are vast. The large and high motte carries\r\na wall of flint rubble, built outside and thus revetting the earthen\r\nbank which formed its first defence. In the small court thus enclosed\r\n(about 100 feet in diameter) the foundations of an oblong keep can\r\nbe discerned. A very wide ditch surrounds the motte, and below it is\r\na horse-shoe bailey, about 2 acres in extent, stretching down to the\r\nformer swamps of the river Nar. On the east side of the motte is a\r\nsmall half-moon annexe, with its own ditch; this curious addition is\r\nto be found in several other motte castles,[346] and is believed to\r\nhave been a work intended to defend the approach, of the nature of\r\na barbican. On the west side of the motte is the village of Castle\r\nAcre, enclosed in an oblong earthwork with an area of 10 acres. This\r\nwork now goes by the name of the Barbican, but probably this name\r\nhas been extended to it from a barbican covering the castle entrance\r\n(of which entrance the ruins still remain). It is most likely that\r\nthis enclosure was a _burgus_ attached to the castle. Mr Harrod, who\r\nexcavated the banks, found quantities of Roman pottery, which led him\r\nto think that the work was Roman; but as the pottery was all broken,\r\nit is more likely that the banks were thrown up on the site of some\r\nRoman villa.[347] This earthwork has a northern entrance in masonry,\r\nevidently of 13th century date; and as the scanty masonry remaining\r\nof the castle is similar in character, it is probably all of the same\r\ndate. The area covered by the motte and the two original baileys is\r\n3-1/2 acres; that of the whole series of earthworks, 15 acres.\r\n\r\nAcre was only a small manor in Saxon times; its value at the time of\r\nthe Survey had risen from 5_l._ to 9_l._[348]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Carlisle. Castle Acre, Norfolk.]\r\n\r\nCHEPSTOW (Estrighoel or Strigul), Monmouthshire.--Notwithstanding the\r\nfact that there is another castle of the name of Strigul about 9 miles\r\nfrom Chepstow (known also as Troggy Castle), it is clear that Chepstow\r\nis the castle meant by Domesday, as the entry speaks of ships going\r\nup the river, a thing impossible at Strigul.[349] The castle occupies\r\na narrow ridge, well defended by the river on one side, and on the\r\nother by a valley which separates it from the town. There are four\r\nwards, and the last and smallest of all seemed to the writer, when\r\nvisiting the castle, to mark the site of a lowered motte. This opinion,\r\nhowever, is not shared by two competent observers, Mr Harold Sands and\r\nMr Duncan Montgomerie, who had much ampler opportunities for studying\r\nthe remains. This ward is now a barbican, and the masonry upon it\r\nbelongs clearly to the 13th century; it occupies the highest ground in\r\nthe castle, and is separated from the other wards, and from the ridge\r\nbeyond it, by two ditches cut across the headland. The adjoining court\r\nmust have belonged to the earliest part of the castle, as it contains\r\na very remarkable early Norman building (splendidly restored in the\r\n13th century) which is regarded by most authorities as the original\r\nhall of William FitzOsbern. It must, however, have combined both hall\r\nand keep, otherwise the castle was not provided with any citadel, if\r\nthere was no motte.[350] What is now the second ward has a Norman\r\npostern in the south wall, and may have been the bailey to the keep.\r\nAll the other masonry is of the late Early English or the Perpendicular\r\nperiod, and the entrance ward is probably an addition of the 13th\r\ncentury. The shape of all the baileys is roughly quadrangular, except\r\nthat of the fourth, which would be semicircular but for the towers\r\nwhich make corners to it. The whole area of the castle is 1-2/3 acres.\r\n\r\nWe are not told what the value of the manor was before William\r\nFitzOsbern built his castle there, but from the absence of this mention\r\nwe may infer that the site was waste. It paid 40_s._ in his time from\r\nships' dues, 16_l._ in his son Earl Roger's time, and at the date of\r\nthe Survey it paid the king 12_l._[351] Chepstow was not the centre of\r\na large soke, and it appears to have owed all its importance to the\r\ncreation of William FitzOsbern's castle.\r\n\r\nCHESTER.--The statement of Ordericus, that William I. founded this\r\ncastle on his return from his third visit to York, is sufficiently\r\nclear.[352] The very valuable paper of Mr E. W. Cox on Chester\r\nCastle[353] answers most of the questions which pertain to our present\r\ninquiry. The original castle of Chester consisted of the motte, which\r\nstill remains, though much built over, and the small ward on the\r\nedge of which it stands, a polygonal enclosure scarcely an acre in\r\nextent. On the motte the vaulted basement of a tower still remains,\r\nbut the style is so obscured by whitewash and modern accretions that\r\nit is impossible to say whether the vaulting is not modern. The first\r\nbuildings were certainly of wood, but Mr Cox regarded some of the\r\nexisting masonry on the motte as belonging to the 12th century; and\r\nthis would correspond with the entry in the _Pipe Rolls_ of 102_l._\r\n7_s._ 0_d._ spent on the castle by Henry II. in 1159.[354] The tower,\r\nnicknamed Cæsar's Tower, and frequently mistaken for the keep, is\r\nshown in Mr Cox's paper to be only a mural tower of the 13th century,\r\nprobably built when the first ward was surrounded with walls and towers\r\nin masonry.[355] The large outer bailey was first added in the reign\r\nof Henry III.[356] It is further proved by Mr Cox that Chester Castle\r\nstood outside the walls of the Roman city. The manor of Gloverstone lay\r\nbetween it and the city, and was not under the jurisdiction of the city\r\nuntil quite recent times.[357] This disposes of the ball set rolling by\r\nBrompton at the end of the 13th century, and sent on by most Chester\r\ntopographers ever since, that Ethelfleda, when she restored the Roman\r\nwalls of Chester, enlarged their circuit so as to take in the castle.\r\nWe have already referred to this in Chapter III.\r\n\r\nChester, as we have seen, was originally a royal castle. And though it\r\nwas naturally committed to the keeping of the Norman earls of Chester,\r\nand under weak kings may have been regarded by the earls as their own\r\nproperty, no such claim was allowed under a strong ruler. After the\r\ninsurrection of the younger Henry, Hugh, Earl of Chester, forfeited his\r\nlands; Henry II. restored them to him in 1177, but was careful to keep\r\nthe castle in his own hands.[358]\r\n\r\nThe city of Chester, Domesday Book tells us, had greatly gone down in\r\nvalue when the earl received it, probably in 1070; twenty-five houses\r\nhad been destroyed. But it had already recovered its prosperity at the\r\ndate of the Survey; there were as many houses as before, and the ferm\r\nof the city was now let by the earl at a sum greatly exceeding the ferm\r\npaid in King Edward's time.[359] This prosperity must have been due to\r\nthe security provided for the trade of Chester by the Norman castle and\r\nNorman rule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Clifford, Hereford. Clitheroe, Lancs. Corfe,\r\nDorset.]\r\n\r\nCLIFFORD, Herefordshire (Fig. 13).--It is clearly stated by Domesday\r\nBook that William FitzOsbern built this castle on waste land.[360]\r\nAt the date of the Survey it was held by Ralph de Todeni, who had\r\nsub-let it to the sheriff. In the many castles attributed to William\r\nFitzOsbern, who built them as the king's vicegerent, we may see an\r\nindication that the building of castles, even on the marches of Wales,\r\nwas not undertaken without royal license. In the reign of Henry I.\r\nClifford Castle had already passed into the hands of Richard Fitz\r\nPons, the ancestor of the celebrated house of Clifford, and one of the\r\n_barons_ of Bernard de Neufmarché, the Norman conqueror of Brecon.[361]\r\n\r\nThe castle has a large motte, roughly square in shape, which must be\r\nin part artificial.[362] Attached to it on the south-west is a curious\r\ntriangular ward, included in the ditch which surrounds the motte.\r\nThe masonry on the motte is entirely of the \"Edwardian\" style, when\r\nkeepless castles were built; it consists of the remains of a hall, and\r\na mural tower which is too small to be called a keep. There is also a\r\nsmall court, with a wall which stands on a low bank. Below the motte is\r\nan irregular bailey of about 2-1/3 acres, with earthen banks which do\r\nnot appear to have ever carried any masonry, though in the middle of\r\nthe court there is a small mound which evidently covers the remains of\r\nbuildings. The whole area of the castle, including the motte and the\r\ntwo baileys, is about 3-1/2 acres.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor had apparently risen from nothing to 8_l._ 5_s._\r\nClifford was not the centre of a large soke.\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, Lancashire (Fig. 13).--There is no express mention of this\r\ncastle in Domesday Book, but of two places in Yorkshire, Barnoldswick\r\nand Calton, it is said that they are in the _castellate_ of Roger the\r\nPoitevin.[363] A castellate implies a castle, and as there is no other\r\ncastle in the Craven district (to which the words of the Survey relate)\r\nexcept Skipton, which did not form part of Roger's property, there is\r\nno reason to doubt that this castle was Clitheroe, which for centuries\r\nwas the centre of the Honour of that name. The whole land between the\r\nRibble and the Mersey had been given by William I. to this Roger, the\r\nthird son of his trusted supporter, Earl Roger of Shrewsbury. One can\r\nunderstand why William gave important frontier posts to the energetic\r\nand unscrupulous young men of the house of Montgomeri, one of whom was\r\nthe adviser and architect of William Rufus, another a notable warrior\r\nin North Wales, another the conqueror of Pembrokeshire. As it appears\r\nfrom the Survey that Roger's possessions stretched far beyond the\r\nRibble into Yorkshire and Cumberland, it seems quite possible--though\r\nhere we are in the region of conjecture--that just as his father and\r\nbrothers had a free hand to conquer as they listed from the North and\r\nSouth Welsh, so Roger had a similar commission for the hilly districts\r\nstill unconquered in the north-west of England. But fortune did not\r\nfavour the Montgomeri family for long. They were exiled from England in\r\n1102 for siding with Robert Curthose, and in the same year we find the\r\ncastle of Clitheroe in the hands of Robert de Lacy, lord of the great\r\nYorkshire fief of Pontefract.[364]\r\n\r\nThe castle of Clitheroe stands on a lofty motte of natural rock.[365]\r\nThere are no earthworks on the summit, but a stout wall of limestone\r\nrubble without buttresses encloses a small court, on whose south-west\r\nside stands the keep. It is just possible that the outer wall may be\r\nthe original work of Roger, as limestone rubble would be easier to\r\nget than earth on this rocky hill. The keep is small, rudely built of\r\nrubble, and has neither fireplace nor garde-robe, nor the slightest\r\nornamental detail--not even a string course. But in spite of the entire\r\nabsence of ornament, a decorative effect has been sought and obtained\r\nby making the quoins, voussoirs, and lintels of a dressed yellow\r\nsandstone. The care with which this has been done is inconsistent with\r\nthe haste with which Roger must inevitably have constructed his first\r\nfortification, if we suppose, as is probable, that he received the\r\nfirst grant of his northern lands on William's return in 1070 from his\r\nthird visit to the north, when he made that remarkable march through\r\nLancashire to Chester which is described by Ordericus. It seems more\r\nlikely that even if the outer wall or shell were the work of Roger, he\r\nhad only wooden buildings inside its circuit. Dugdale attributes the\r\nbuilding of the keep to the second Robert de Lacy, between 1187 and\r\n1194, and it is probable that this date is correct.[366] The bailey of\r\nClitheroe lay considerably below the keep, and is now overbuilt with a\r\nmodern house, offices, and garden. It covers one acre. A Roman road up\r\nthe valley of the Ribble passes near the foot of the rock.[367]\r\n\r\nAs the very name of Clitheroe is not mentioned in Domesday Book, it\r\nclearly was not an important centre in Saxon times. The value of\r\nBlackburn Hundred, in which Clitheroe is situated, had fallen between\r\nthe Confessor's time and the time when Roger received it. It is quite\r\npossible that he never lived at Clitheroe, as he sub-infeoffed the\r\nmanor and Hundred of Blackburn to Roger de Busli and Albert Greslet\r\nbefore 1086.[368]\r\n\r\nCOLCHESTER, Essex.--The remarkable keep of this castle has been the\r\nsubject of antiquarian legend for many centuries, and Mr Clark has\r\nthe merit of having proved its early Norman origin, by its plan and\r\narchitecture. A charter of Henry I. is preserved in the cartulary\r\nof St John's Abbey at Colchester, which grants to Eudes the Dapifer\r\n\"the city of Colchester, and the tower and the castle, and all the\r\nfortifications of the castle, just as my father had them and my\r\nbrother and myself.\"[369] This proves that the keep and castle were\r\nin existence in the Conqueror's time; the Norman character of the\r\narchitecture proves that the keep was not in existence earlier. We see,\r\nthen, that the reason there is no motte at Colchester is that there was\r\na stone keep built when first the castle was founded. As far as we are\r\naware, Colchester, the Tower of London, and the recently discovered\r\nkeep of Pevensey are the only certain instances of stone keeps of the\r\n11th century in England.\r\n\r\nThat one of the most important of the Conqueror's castles, second\r\nonly to the Tower of London, and actually exceeding it in the\r\narea it covers, should be found in Colchester, is not surprising,\r\nbecause the Eastern counties at the time of the Conquest were not\r\nonly the wealthiest part of the kingdom (as Domesday Book clearly\r\nshows[370]), but they also needed special protection from the attacks\r\nof Scandinavian enemies. Mr Round has conjectured that the castle\r\nwas built at the time of the invasion of St Cnut, between 1080 and\r\n1085.[371]\r\n\r\nThe castle is built of Roman stones used over again, with rows of tiles\r\nintroduced between the courses with much decorative effect.[372] The\r\noriginal doorway was on the first floor, as in most Norman keeps; but\r\nat some after time, probably in the reign of Henry I.,[373] the present\r\ndoorway was inserted; and most likely the handsome stairway which now\r\nleads up from this basement entrance was added, as it shows clear marks\r\nof insertion. Henry II. was working on the walls of the castle in 1182,\r\nand it may be strongly suspected that the repairs in ashlar, and the\r\ncasing of the buttresses with ashlar, were his work.[374] One item\r\nin the accounts of Henry II. is £50 \"for making the bailey round the\r\ncastle.\"[375] There were two baileys to the castle of Colchester--the\r\ninner one, which scarcely covered 2 acres, and the outer one, which\r\ncontained about 11. The inner bailey was enclosed at first with an\r\nearthwork and stockade, the earthwork being thrown up over the remains\r\nof some Roman walls, whose line it does not follow. Afterwards a stone\r\nwall was built on the earthwork, the foundations of which can still be\r\ntraced in the west rampart.[376] The outer bailey, which lay to the\r\nnorth, extended on two sides to the Roman walls of the town; on the\r\nwest side it had a rampart and stockade. If the £50 spent by Henry II.\r\nrepresents the cost of a stone wall round the inner bailey, then the\r\n_palicium_ blown down by the wind in 1219 must have been the wooden\r\nstockade on the west side of the outer bailey.[377] The question is\r\ndifficult to decide, but at any rate the entry proves that as late\r\nas Henry III.'s reign, some part of the outer defences of Colchester\r\nCastle was still of timber.\r\n\r\nThe position of Colchester Castle is exceptional in one respect, that\r\nthe castle is almost in the middle of the town. But this very unusual\r\nposition is explained by Mr Round's statement that the land forming the\r\ncastle baileys, as well as that afterwards given to the Grey Friars\r\non the east, was crown demesne before the Conquest, and consequently\r\nhad been cultivated land, so that we do not hear of any houses in\r\nColchester being destroyed for the site of the castle.[378] But by\r\nkeeping this land as the inalienable appendage of the royal castle\r\nWilliam secured that communication between the castle and the outside\r\ncountry which was so essential to the invaders.\r\n\r\nThe value of the city of Colchester had risen enormously at the date of\r\nthe Survey.[379]\r\n\r\nCORFE, Dorset (Fig. 13).--Mr Eyton has shown that for the _castellum\r\nWarham_ of Domesday Book we ought to read _Corfe_, because the castle\r\nwas built in the manor of Kingston, four miles from Wareham.[380]\r\nAnd this is made clear by the _Testa de Nevill_, which says that\r\nthe church of Gillingham was given to the nunnery of Shaftesbury in\r\nexchange for the land on which the castle of Corfe is placed.[381]\r\nBecause King Edward the Martyr was murdered at Corfe, at some place\r\nwhere his stepmother Elfrida was residing, it has been inferred that\r\nthere was a Saxon castle at Corfe; and because there is a building with\r\nsome herring-bone work among the present ruins, it has been assumed\r\nthat this building is the remains of that castle or palace. But the\r\n_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, the only contemporary authority for the event,\r\nsays nothing of any castle at Corfe, but simply tells us that Edward\r\nwas slain at Corfe Geat, a name which evidently alludes to a gap or\r\npassage through the chalk hills, such as there is at Corfe.[382] Nor\r\nis there any mention of Corfe as a fortress in Anglo-Saxon times;\r\nit is not named in the _Burghal Hidage_, and we do not hear of any\r\nsieges of it by the Danes. Nor is it likely that the Saxons would\r\nhave had a fortress at Corfe, when they had a fortified town so near\r\nas Wareham.[383] Kingston, the manor in which Corfe is situated, was\r\nnot an important place, as it had no dependent soke. The language of\r\nDomesday absolutely upsets the idea of any Saxon castle or palace at\r\nCorfe, as it tells us that William obtained the land for his castle\r\nfrom the nuns of Shaftesbury, and we may be quite sure they had no\r\ncastle there.[384]\r\n\r\nCorfe Castle stands on a natural hill, which has been so scarped\r\nartificially that the highest part now forms a large motte. Three wards\r\nexist--the eastern or motte ward, the western, and the southern. The\r\ntwo former probably formed the original castle. On the motte (which\r\npossibly is not artificial, but formed by scarping) stands the lofty\r\nkeep, of splendid workmanship, probably of the time of Henry I. In\r\nthe ward pertaining to it are buildings of the time of John and Henry\r\nIII.[385] The western ward has towers of the 13th century, but it also\r\ncontains the interesting remains of an early Norman building, probably\r\na hall or chapel, built largely of herring-bone work; this is the\r\nbuilding which has been so positively asserted to be a Saxon palace.\r\nBut herring-bone masonry, which used to be thought an infallible sign\r\nof Saxon work, is now found to be more often Norman.[386] The building\r\nis certainly an ancient one, and may possibly have been contemporary\r\nwith the first Norman castle; its details are unmistakably Norman.\r\nBut very likely it was the only Norman masonry of the 11th century at\r\nCorfe Castle.[387] It is clear that the stone wall which at present\r\nsurrounds the western bailey did not exist when the hall (or chapel)\r\nwas built, as it blocks up its southern windows. Probably there was a\r\npalisade at first on the edge of the scarp. Palisades still formed part\r\nof the defences of the castle in the time of Henry III., when 62_l._\r\nwas paid \"for making two good walls in place of the palisades at Corfe\r\nbetween the old bailey of the said castle and the middle bailey towards\r\nthe west, and between the keep of the said castle and the outer bailey\r\ntowards the south.\"[388] This shows that the present wing-walls down\r\nfrom the motte were previously represented by stockades. The ditch\r\nbetween the keep and the southern bailey has been attributed to King\r\nJohn, on the strength of an entry in the _Close Rolls_ which orders\r\nfifteen miners and stone-masons to work on the banks of the ditch in\r\n1214.[389] But we may be quite certain that this ditch below the motte\r\nbelonged to the original plan of the castle; John's work would be\r\neither to line it with masonry, or to enlarge it. It is not without\r\nsignificance for the early history of the castle that Durandus the\r\n_carpenter_ held the manor of Mouldham near Corfe, by the service of\r\nfinding a carpenter to work at the keep whenever required.[390]\r\n\r\nThe area of Corfe Castle, if we include the large southern bailey,\r\nis 3-3/4 acres; without it, 1-1/2 acres. This bailey was certainly in\r\nexistence in the reign of Henry III. (as the extract from the _Close\r\nRolls_ proves) before the towers of superb masonry were added to it by\r\nEdward I.\r\n\r\nThe value of Kingston Manor had considerably increased at the date of\r\nthe Survey. After the Count of Mortain forfeited his lands (in 1105),\r\nthe castle of Corfe was kept in the hands of the crown, and this\r\nincreases the probability that the keep was built by Henry I.\r\n\r\nAbout 400 yards S.W. of Corfe Castle is an earthwork which might be\r\ncalled a \"Ring and Bailey.\" Instead of the usual motte there is a\r\ncircular enclosure, defended by a bank and ditch of about the same\r\nheight as those of its bailey, but having in addition an interior\r\nplatform or berm. This work is probably the remains of a camp thrown up\r\nby Stephen during his unsuccessful siege of Corfe Castle in 1139.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. Dover. (From a plan in the British Museum,\r\n1756.)]\r\n\r\nDOVER, Kent (Fig. 14).--The Norman historian, William of Poitiers,\r\ntells us that the castrum of Dover was built by Harold at his own\r\nexpense.[391] This comes from the celebrated story of the oath of\r\nHarold to William, a story of which Mr Freeman says that there is no\r\nportion of our history more entangled in the mazes of contradictory\r\nand often impossible statements.[392] But let us assume the statement\r\nabout the _castrum_ to be true; the question then to be answered is\r\nthis: of what nature was that castrum? We never are told by English\r\nchroniclers that Harold built any castles, though we do hear of his\r\nfortifying towns. The present writer would answer this question,\r\ntentatively indeed, and under correction, by the theory that the\r\ncastrum constructed or repaired by Harold was the present outer rampart\r\nof Dover Castle, which encloses an area of about 34 acres, and may have\r\nenclosed more, if it was formerly complete on the side towards the\r\nsea.[393] The evidence in support of this theory is as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. There certainly was a _burh_ on the top of the cliff at Dover in\r\nSaxon times, as the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ tells us that in 1048\r\nEustace of Boulogne, after coming to Dover, and slaying householders\r\nthere, went _up to the burh_, and slew people both within and without,\r\nbut was repulsed by the burh-men.[394] There was then a burh, and\r\nvaliant burh-men on the cliff at Dover in Edward the Confessor's reign.\r\nBut the whole analogy of the word burh makes it certain that by the\r\ntime of Edward it meant a fortified town.[395]\r\n\r\n2. That the burh at Dover was of the nature of a town, with houses\r\nin it, is confirmed by the poem of Guy of Amiens, who says that when\r\nKing William entered the _castrum_, he ordered the English to evacuate\r\ntheir houses.[396] William of Poitiers also states that there was an\r\ninnumerable multitude of people in the castle,[397] though he may refer\r\nto a multitude gathered there for safety.\r\n\r\n3. Though the whole of the outer enceinte is generally credited to\r\nHubert de Burgh in Henry III.'s reign, the truth probably is that he\r\nbuilt the first stone walls and towers on the outer rampart; but the\r\nexistence of this earthen rampart shows that there was a wooden wall\r\nupon it previously. It is not improbable that it was for the repair of\r\nthis wooden wall that so much timber was sent to Dover in the reigns\r\nof Richard I. and John.[398] Dering, who was lieutenant of the castle\r\nin 1629, records the tradition that the tower in the outer enceinte,\r\ncalled Canons' Gate, dates from Saxon times (of course this could only\r\nbe true of a wooden predecessor of the stone tower), and that Godwin's\r\nTower, on the east side of the outer vallum, existed as a postern\r\nbefore the Conquest.[399] Nearly all the towers on this wall were\r\nsupported by certain manors held on the tenure of castle-guard, and\r\neight of them still retain the names of eight knights to whom William\r\nis said to have given lands on this tenure. Mr Round has shown that\r\nthe _Warda Constabularii_ of Dover Castle can be traced back to the\r\nConquest, and that it is a mere legend that it was given as a fief to a\r\nFienes. He remarks that the nine wards of the castle named in the Red\r\nBook of the Exchequer are all reproduced in the names still attached to\r\nthe towers. \"This coincidence of testimony leads us to believe that the\r\nnames must have been attached at a very early period; and looking at\r\nthe history of the families named, it cannot have been later than that\r\nof Henry II.\"[400] May it not have been even earlier? Eight of these\r\nnames are attached to towers on the outer circuit,[401] and five of\r\nthem are found as landholders in Kent in Domesday Book.\r\n\r\n4. William of Poitiers further tells us that when the duke had taken\r\nthe castle, he remained there eight days, _to add the fortifications\r\nwhich were wanting_.[402] What was wanting to a Norman eye in\r\nAnglo-Saxon fortifications, as far as we know them, was a citadel; and\r\nwithout laying too much stress on the chronicler's eight days, we may\r\nassume that the short time spent by William at Dover was just enough\r\nfor the construction of a motte and bailey, inside the _castrum_ of\r\nHarold, but crowned by wooden buildings only.\r\n\r\nTaking these things together, we venture to assume that the inner court\r\nin which the keep of Dover stands, represents an original motte, or at\r\nany rate an original citadel, added to the castle by William I. Whether\r\nwhat now remains of this motte is in part artificial, we do not pretend\r\nto say; it may be that it was formed simply by digging a deep ditch\r\nround the highest knoll of ground within the ancient ramparts.[403]\r\nAnyhow, it is still in effect a motte, and a large one, containing not\r\nonly the magnificent keep, but a small ward as well. That this keep was\r\nthe work of Henry II. there can be no manner of doubt; the _Pipe Rolls_\r\nshow that he spent more than £2000 on the _turris_ or keep of Dover\r\nCastle between the years 1181 and 1187, and Benedict of Peterborough\r\nmentions the building of the keep at this date.[404] The curtain around\r\nthe motte may also be reckoned to be his work originally, as the\r\n_cingulum_ is spoken of along with the _turris_ in the accounts. Modern\r\nalterations have left little of Norman character in this curtain which\r\nshows at a glance, and the gateways (one of which remains) belong to a\r\nlater period.\r\n\r\nAttached to this keep ward is another ward, whose rampart is generally\r\nattributed to Saxon times. We are not in a position positively to\r\ndeny that the Saxons had an inner earthwork on the highest part of\r\nthe ground within their _burh_. But considering that small citadels\r\nare unusual in Saxon earthworks: considering also that this bailey is\r\nattached to the motte in the usual manner of a Norman bailey, and that\r\nits size corresponds to the usual size of an original Norman bailey in\r\nan important place, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that this\r\nwas the original bailey attached to the Conqueror's motte. Its shape\r\nis singular, part of it being nearly square, while at the S.E. corner\r\na large oval loop is thrown out, so as to enclose the Roman Pharos and\r\nthe Saxon church. The outline of the bailey certainly suggests that it\r\nwas built after the Pharos and the church, and was built with reference\r\nprimarily to the keep or motte ward. The nature of the ground, and\r\nthe necessity of enclosing the church and the Roman tower within\r\nthe immediate bailey of the castle, which would otherwise have been\r\ncommanded by them, were the other factors which decided the unusual\r\nshape of the bailey.\r\n\r\nOn this earthwork the foundations of a rubble wall were formerly to\r\nbe traced,[405] probably built by Henry II., as considerable sums for\r\n\"the wall of the castle\" are mentioned in his accounts.[406] Whether\r\nthere are still any remains of this curtain we are unable to say, but\r\nso many of the features of the middle ward have been swept away by\r\nmodern alterations, and the difficulty of examining what remains, owing\r\nto military restrictions, is so great, that little can be said about\r\nit, and we find that most authorities observe a judicious silence on\r\nthe subject. But as the carriage of stone is expressly mentioned in\r\nHenry II.'s accounts, we may with great probability assign to him the\r\ntransformation of the original wooden castle of William into a castle\r\nof stone; while the transformation of the Anglo-Saxon borough into a\r\nstone enceinte was the work of Henry III.'s reign.\r\n\r\nWe think the evidence suggests that this _burh_ or outer rampart was in\r\nexistence when the Conqueror came to Dover, crowned in all probability\r\nwith a stockade and towers of wood. It may possibly have been a British\r\nor even a Roman earthwork originally (though its outline does not\r\nsuggest Roman work); or it may have been built by Harold as a city of\r\nrefuge for the inhabitants of the port.[407] The Saxon church which it\r\nencloses, and which has long been attributed to the earliest days of\r\nSaxon Christianity, is now pronounced by the best authorities to be\r\ncomparatively late in the style.[408]\r\n\r\nThe size of the inner castle of Dover appears to be about 6 acres,\r\nreckoning the keep ward at 2, and the bailey at about 4.\r\n\r\nThe value of the town of Dover had trebled at the time of the Survey,\r\nin spite of the burning of the town at William's first advent.[409]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Dudley, Staffs. Dunster, Somerset.]\r\n\r\nDUDLEY, Staffordshire (Fig. 15).--William Fitz Ansculf held Dudley\r\nat the time of the Survey, \"and there is his castle.\"[410] Mr Clark\r\nappears to accept the dubious tradition of a Saxon Dodda, who first\r\nbuilt this castle in the 8th century, since he speaks of Dudley as\r\n\"a great English residence.\"[411] This tradition, however, is not\r\nsupported by Domesday Book, which shows Dudley to have been only a\r\nsmall and unimportant manor before the Conquest. The strong position\r\nof the hill was no doubt the reason why the Norman placed his castle\r\nthere. There is no Norman masonry in the present ruins. The earliest\r\nwork is that of the keep on the motte, a rectangular tower with round\r\ncorner turrets, attributed by Mr W. St John Hope to about 1320. The\r\nfirst castle was demolished by Henry II. in 1175,[412] and an attempt\r\nto restore it in 1218 was stringently countermanded.[413] The case\r\nof Dudley is one of those which proves that Henry II. destroyed some\r\nlawful castles in 1175 as well as the unlawful ones. In 1264 a license\r\nto restore it was granted to Roger de Somery, in consideration of his\r\ndevotion to the king's cause in the Barons' War.[414] The whole area\r\nof the castle, including the motte, but not including the works at\r\nthe base of the hill on which it stands, is 1-3/4 acres. The bailey\r\nis an irregular oval, following the hill top. Dudley is an instance\r\nin which the value of the manor has gone down instead of up since the\r\nerection of the castle; this may perhaps be laid to the account of the\r\ndevastation caused through the Staffordshire insurrection of 1069.\r\n\r\nDUNSTER, Somerset (Fig. 15).--Called Torre in Domesday Book. \"There\r\nWilliam de Moion has his castle.\"[415] The motte here appears to be a\r\nnatural rock or _tor_, whose summit has been levelled and its sides\r\nscarped by art. About 80 feet below the top is a (roughly) half-moon\r\nbailey, itself a shelf on the side of the hill; there is another and\r\nmuch smaller shelf at the opposite end.[416] Some foundations found in\r\nthe S.W. corner of the upper ward appear to indicate a former stone\r\nkeep.[417] Dunster was only a small manor of half a hide before the\r\nConquest, but afterwards its value tripled. There was a borough as\r\nwell as a castle.[418] The castle became the _caput baroniæ_ of the\r\nDe Moions, to whom the Conqueror gave fifty-six manors in different\r\nparts of the county. There is not the slightest reason to suppose that\r\nthe site was fortified before the Conquest. Mr Clark remarks that \"it\r\nis remarkable that no mouldings or fragments of Norman ornament have\r\nbeen dug up in or about the site, although there is original Norman\r\nwork in the parish church.\" The simple explanation, probably, is that\r\nthe first castle of De Moion was of wood, although on a site where it\r\nwould have been possible to build in stone from the first, as it does\r\nnot appear that any part of the motte is artificial. The area of the\r\nbailey is 1-3/4 acres. The value of Dunster had risen at the date of\r\nDomesday.[419]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. Durham.]\r\n\r\nDURHAM (Fig. 16).--The castle here was first built by the Conqueror, on\r\nhis return from his expedition against Scotland in 1072.[420] It was\r\nintended as a strong residence for the bishop, through whom William\r\nhoped to govern this turbulent part of the country. He placed it on the\r\nneck of the lofty peninsula on which the cathedral stands. The motte of\r\nthe Conqueror still remains, and so does the chapel[421] which he built\r\nin the bailey; probably the present court of the castle, though crowded\r\nnow with buildings, represents the outline of the original bailey.[422]\r\nThe present shell keep on the motte was built by Bishop Hatfield in\r\nEdward III.'s reign,[423] but has been extensively modernised. There\r\ncan be little doubt that up to 1345 there were only wooden buildings\r\non the motte, as the writer was informed by Canon Greenwell that no\r\nremains of older stone-work than the 14th century had been found there.\r\nIt is so seldom that we get any contemporary description of a castle\r\nof this kind, that it seems worth while to translate the bombastic\r\nverse in which Laurence, Prior of Durham, described that of Durham in\r\nStephen's reign:[424]\r\n\r\n\"Not far hence [from the north road into the city] a tumulus of rising\r\nearth explains the flatness of the excavated summit, explains the\r\nnarrow field on the flattened vertex, which the apex of the castle\r\noccupies with very pleasing art. On this open space the castle is\r\nseated like a queen; from its threatening height, it holds all that\r\nit sees as its own. From its gate, the stubborn wall rises with the\r\nrising mound,[425] and rising still further, makes towards the comfort\r\n(amæna) of the keep. But the keep, compacted together, rises again\r\ninto thin air, strong within and without, well fitted for its work, for\r\nwithin the ground rises higher by three cubits than without--ground\r\nmade sound by solid earth. Above this, a stalwart house[426] springs\r\nyet higher than the [shell] keep, glittering with splendid beauty in\r\nevery part; _four posts are plain, on which it rests, one post at each\r\nstrong corner_.[427] Each face is girded by a beautiful gallery, which\r\nis fixed into the warlike wall.[428] A bridge, rising from the chapel\r\n[in the bailey] gives a ready ascent to the ramparts, easy to climb;\r\nstarting from them, a broad way makes the round of the top of the wall,\r\nand this is the usual way to the top of the citadel.... The bridge\r\nis divided into easy steps, no headlong drop, but an easy slope from\r\nthe top to the bottom. Near the [head of the] bridge, a wall descends\r\nfrom the citadel, turning its face westward towards the river.[429]\r\nFrom the river's lofty bank it turns away in a broad curve to meet the\r\nfield [_i.e._, Palace Green]. It is no bare plot empty of buildings\r\nthat this high wall surrounds with its sweep, but one containing\r\ngoodly habitations.[430] There you will find two vast palaces built\r\nwith porches, the skill of whose builders the building well reveals.\r\nThere, too, the chapel stands out beautifully raised on six pillars,\r\nnot over vast, but fair enough to view. Here chambers are joined to\r\nchambers, house to house, each suited to the purpose that it serves....\r\nThere is a building in the middle of the castle which has a deep well\r\nof abundant water.... The frowning gate faces the rainy south, a gate\r\nthat is strong, high-reaching, easily held by the hand of a weakling or\r\na woman. The bridge is let down for egress,[431] and thus the way goes\r\nacross the broad moat. It goes to the plain which is protected on all\r\nsides by a wall, where the youth often held their joyous games. Thus\r\nthe castellan, and the castle artfully placed on the high ridge, defend\r\nthe northern side of the cathedral. And from this castle a strong wall\r\ngoes down southwards, continued to the end of the church.\"[432]\r\n\r\nThe original bailey of this castle covers 1 acre.\r\n\r\nELY, Cambridgeshire (Fig. 17).--This castle was built by William I. in\r\n1070, when he was repressing the last struggle of the English under\r\nthe heroic Hereward. The monks of Ely felt it a sore grievance that he\r\nplaced the castle within their own bounds.[433] Both this castle and\r\nthe one built by William at Aldreth, to defend the passage into the\r\nIsle of Ely, had a continuous existence, as they were both refortified\r\nby Nigel, Bishop of Ely in Stephen's reign, and Ely Castle was besieged\r\nand taken by Stephen.[434] The earthworks of this castle still exist,\r\nto the south of the Minster. There is a fine motte with an oval\r\nbailey, of which the banks and ditches are traceable in parts. The area\r\nof the bailey is 2-1/2 acres. Of Aldreth or Aldrey there appear to be\r\nno remains.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Ely was £33 in the Confessor's reign; it fell\r\nto £20 after the devastations of the Conquest, but had risen again to\r\n£30 at the time of the Survey.[435]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. Ely, Cambs. Ewias Harold, Hereford. Eye,\r\nSuffolk.]\r\n\r\nEWIAS, Herefordshire (Fig. 17).--The brief notice of this castle\r\nin Domesday Book throws some light on the general theory of\r\ncastle-building in England.[436] William FitzOsbern, as the king's\r\nvicegerent, rebuilt this march castle, and committed it to the keeping\r\nof another Norman noble, and the king confirmed the arrangement. But\r\nin theory the castle would always be the king's. This is the only\r\ncase in the Survey where we hear of a castle being _rebuilt_ by the\r\nNormans. We naturally look to one of King Edward's Norman favourites\r\nas the first founder, for they alone are said by history to have built\r\ncastles on the Welsh marches before the Conquest. Dr Round conjectures\r\nthat Ewias was the \"Pentecost's castle\" spoken of in the (Peterborough)\r\n_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ in 1052.[437] No masonry is now to be seen on\r\nthe motte at Ewias, but Mr Clark states that the outline of a circular\r\nor polygonal shell keep is shown by a trench out of which the\r\nfoundations have been removed. The bailey is roughly of half-moon shape\r\nand the mound oval. The whole area of the castle, including the motte\r\nand banks, is 2-1/3 acres.\r\n\r\nEXETER.--This castle is not mentioned in Domesday Book, but\r\nOrdericus tells us that William _chose_ a site for the castle within\r\nthe walls, and left Baldwin de Molis, son of Count Gilbert, and\r\nother distinguished knights, to finish the work, and remain as a\r\ngarrison.[438] In spite of this clear indication that the castle was\r\na new thing, it has been obstinately held that it only occupied the\r\nsite of some former castle, Roman or Saxon.[439] Exeter, of course,\r\nwas a Roman castrum, and its walls had been restored by Athelstan.\r\nIn this case William placed his castle inside instead of outside the\r\ncity walls, because, owing to the natural situation of Exeter, he\r\nfound in the north-west corner a site which commanded the whole city.\r\nAlthough Domesday Book is silent about the castle, it tells us that\r\nforty-eight houses in Exeter had been destroyed since William came to\r\nEngland,[440] and Freeman remarks that \"we may assume that these houses\r\nwere destroyed to make room for the castle, though it is not expressly\r\nsaid that they were.\"[441]\r\n\r\nExeter Castle stands on a natural knoll, occupying the north-west\r\ncorner of the city, which has been converted into a sort of square\r\nmotte by digging a great ditch round the two sides of its base towards\r\nthe town.[442] That this ditch is no pre-Roman work is shown by the\r\nfact that it stops short at the Roman wall, and begins again on the\r\noutside of it, where, however, the greater part has been levelled to\r\nform the promenade of the _Northernhay_ or north rampart of the city.\r\nOn top of this hill, banks 30 feet high were thrown up, which still\r\nremain, and give to the courtyard which they enclose the appearance\r\nof a pit.[443] On top of these banks there are now stone walls; but\r\nthese were certainly no part of the work of Baldwin de Molis, who must\r\nhave placed a wooden stockade on the banks which he constructed. One\r\npiece of stonework he probably did set up, the gatehouse, which by its\r\ntriangle-headed windows and its long-and-short work is almost certainly\r\nof the 11th century. It has frequently been called Saxon, but more\r\ncareful critics now regard it as \"work that must have been done, if not\r\nby Norman hands, at Norman bidding and on Norman design.\"[444] It was\r\nno uncommon thing at this early period to have gatehouses of stone to\r\nwalls of earth and wood. Of these gatehouses Exeter is the most perfect\r\nand the most clearly stamped with antiquity.\r\n\r\nOne thing we look for in vain at Exeter, and that is a citadel. There\r\nis no keep, and there is no record that there ever was one, though a\r\nchapel, hall, and other houses are mentioned in ancient accounts. Mr\r\nClark says that probably the Normans regarded the whole court as a\r\nshell keep. It certainly was, in effect, a motte; but it was altogether\r\nexceptional among Norman castles of importance if it had no bailey. And\r\nin fact a bailey is mentioned in the _Pipe Roll_ of 1 Richard I., where\r\nthere is an entry for the cost of making a gaol in the bailey of the\r\ncastle.[445] Now Norden, who published a plan of Exeter in 1619, says\r\nthat the prison which formerly existed at the bottom of Castle Lane (on\r\nthe south or city front of the present castle) was \"built upon Castle\r\ngrounde,\" and he states that the buildings and gardens which have been\r\nmade on this ground are intrusions on the king's rights.[446] The\r\nremarkably full account of the siege of Exeter in the _Gesta Stephani_\r\nspeaks of an outer _promurale_ which was taken by Stephen, as well as\r\nthe inner bridge leading from the town to the castle, before the attack\r\non the castle itself. Unfortunately the word _promurale_ has the same\r\nuncertainty about it that attaches to so many mediæval terms, and the\r\ndescription given of it would apply either to the banks of a bailey,\r\nor to the _heriçon_ on the counterscarp of the ditch of the motte.\r\nWe must, therefore, leave it to the reader's judgment whether the\r\nevidence given above is sufficient to establish the former existence\r\nof a bailey at Exeter, and to place Exeter among the castles of the\r\nmotte-and-bailey type.\r\n\r\nThe description of the castle given by the writer of the Gesta has\r\nmany points of interest.[447] He describes the castle as standing on a\r\nvery high mound (_editissimo aggere_) hedged in by an insurmountable\r\nwall, which was defended by \"Cæsarian\" towers built with the very\r\nhardest mortar. This must refer to Roman towers which may have existed\r\non the Roman part of the wall. Whether there was a stone wall on the\r\nother two sides, facing the city, may be doubted, as the expenditure\r\nentered to Henry II. in the _Pipe Rolls_ suggests that he was the\r\nfirst to put stone walls on the banks, and the two ancient towers\r\nwhich still exist appear to be of his time.[448] The chronicler goes\r\non to say that after Stephen had taken the _promurale_ and broken down\r\nthe bridge, there were several days and nights of fighting before he\r\ncould win the castle, which was eventually forced to surrender by the\r\ndrying-up of the wells. The mining operations which he describes were\r\nno doubt undertaken with the view of shaking down the Roman wall at the\r\nangle where it joins the artificial bank of Baldwin de Molis. Possibly\r\nthe chamber in the rock with the mysterious passages leading from it,\r\nwhich is still to be seen in the garden of Miss Owthwaite, at the\r\npoint where the ditch ends, is the work of Stephen's miners.[449] The\r\ndescription of his soldiers scrambling up the _agger_ on their hands\r\nand knees (_quadrupede incessu_) will be well understood by those who\r\nhave seen the castle bank as it still rises from that ditch.\r\n\r\nThe present ward of Exeter Castle, which is rudely square in plan,\r\ncovers an area of 2 acres, which is as large as the whole area of many\r\nof the smaller Norman castles. The castle was allowed to fall into\r\ndecay as early as 1549,[450] and since then it has been devastated by\r\nthe building of a Sessions House and a gaol. No plan has been preserved\r\nof the former buildings in this court, though the site of the chapel is\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThere is no statement in Domesday Book as to the value of Exeter.\r\n\r\nEYE, Suffolk (Fig. 17).--This castle was built by William Malet, one\r\nof the companions of the Conqueror, who is described as having been\r\nhalf Norman and half English.[451] Eye, as its name implies, seems\r\nto have been an island in a marsh in Norman times, and therefore a\r\nnaturally defensible situation. The references in the _Pipe Rolls_ to\r\nthe _palicium_ and the _bretasches_ of Eye Castle show that the outer\r\ndefences of the castle at any rate were of wood in the days of Henry\r\nII.[452] That there were works in masonry at some subsequent period\r\nis shown by a solitary vestige of a wing wall of flints which runs up\r\nthe motte. A modern tower now occupies the summit. The bailey of the\r\ncastle, the outline of which can still be traced, though the area is\r\ncovered with buildings and gardens, was oval in shape, and covered 2\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Eye had gone up since the Conquest from\r\n£15 to £21. This must have been due to the castle and to the market\r\nwhich Robert Malet or his son William established close to the castle;\r\nfor the stock on the manor and the number of ploughs had actually\r\ndecreased.[453] A proof that there is no deliberate register of\r\ncastles in Domesday Book is furnished by the very careful inventory\r\nof the manor of Eye, where there is no mention of a castle, though it\r\nis noticed that there are now a park and a market; and it is only in\r\nthe account of the lands of the bishop of Thetford, in mentioning the\r\ninjury which William Malet's market at Eye had done to the bishop's\r\nmarket at Hoxne, that the castle of Eye is named.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.--\"There were sixteen houses where the castle sits, but\r\nnow they are gone, and fourteen have been destroyed in the _burgus_\r\nof the city,\" says Domesday Book.[454] Gloucester was undoubtedly a\r\nRoman _chester_, and Roman pavements have been found there.[455] The\r\ndescription in the Survey would lead us to think that the castle was\r\noutside the ancient walls,[456] though Speed's map places it on the\r\nline of the wall of his time, which may have been a mediæval extension.\r\nThe castle of Gloucester is now entirely destroyed, but there is\r\nsufficient evidence to show that it was of the usual Norman type. There\r\nwas a motte, which was standing in 1819, and which was then called\r\nthe Barbican Hill;[457] it appears to have been utilised as part of\r\nthe works of the barbican. This motte must originally have supported\r\na wooden keep, and Henry I. must have been the builder of the stone\r\nkeep which Leland saw \"in the middle of the area;\"[458] for in 1100\r\nHenry gave lands to Gloucester Abbey \"in exchange for the site where\r\nnow the keep of Gloucester stands.\"[459] The bailey had previously\r\nbeen enlarged by William Rufus.[460] Possibly the _framea turris_ or\r\nframework tower spoken of in Henry II.'s reign may refer to the wooden\r\nkeep which had been left standing on the motte.[461] The walls of\r\nGloucester Castle were frequently repaired by Henry II.,[462] but the\r\nword _murus_ by no means implies always a stone wall, and it is certain\r\nthat the castle was at that time surrounded by a wooden stockade, as\r\na writ of a much later period (1225) says that the stockade which is\r\naround our castle of Gloucester has been blown down and broken by the\r\nwind, and must be repaired.[463] Wooden bretasches on the walls are\r\nspoken of in the _Pipe Rolls_ of 1193, and even as late as 1222.[464]\r\n\r\nThe value of the city of Gloucester had apparently risen at the time of\r\nthe Survey, though the entry being largely in kind, T. R. E., it is not\r\neasy to calculate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Hastings, Sussex. Huntingdon.]\r\n\r\nHASTINGS, Sussex (Fig. 18).--In this case we have positive contemporary\r\nevidence that the earthen mound of the castle was thrown up by the\r\nNormans at the time of the Conquest, for there is a picture in the\r\nBayeux Tapestry which shows them doing it. A number of men with\r\nspades are at work raising a circular mound, on the top of which,\r\nwith the usual all-inclusiveness of mediæval picturing, a stockade\r\nis already erected. A man with a pick seems to be working at the\r\nditch. The inscription attached is: \"He commands that a castle be\r\ndug at Hestengaceastra.\"[465] There is no need to comment on the\r\nsignificance of this drawing and its inscription for the history of\r\nearly Norman castles; what is extraordinary is that it should have\r\nbeen entirely overlooked for so long. In no case is our information\r\nmore complete than about Hastings. Not only does Domesday Book mention\r\nthe _castellaria_ of Hastings,[466] but the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_\r\nalso tells us that William built a castle there, while the chronicle\r\nof Battle Abbey makes the evidence complete by telling us that \"having\r\ntaken possession of a suitable site, he built a _wooden castle_\r\nthere.\"[467] This of course means the stockade on top of the motte,\r\nwith the wooden tower or towers which would certainly be added to it.\r\nWace states that this wooden castle was brought over in pieces in the\r\nships of the Count of Eu.[468]\r\n\r\nThe masonry now existing at the castle is probably none of it older\r\nthan the reign of Henry II. at the earliest, and most of it is\r\ncertainly much later.[469] The _Pipe Rolls_ show that Henry II. spent\r\n£235 on the castle of Hastings between the years 1160 and 1181, and\r\nit is indicated that some of this money was for stone, and some was\r\nfor a keep (_turrim_).[470] There is no tower large enough for a keep\r\nat Hastings now, nor have any stone foundations been found on the\r\nmotte, and Mr Harold Sands, who has paid particular attention to this\r\ncastle, concludes that Henry II.'s keep has been carried away by the\r\nsea, which has probably torn away at least 2 acres from the area of\r\nthe castle.[471] The beautiful fragment of the Chapel of St Mary is\r\nprobably of Henry II.'s reign; the walls and towers on the east side\r\nof the castle appear to be of the 13th century. The ditch does not run\r\nround the motte, but is cut through the peninsular rock on which the\r\ncastle stands, the motte and its ward being thus isolated. The form of\r\nthis bailey is now triangular, but it may have been square originally.\r\nBeyond the ditch is another bailey, defended by earthen banks and by a\r\nsecond ditch cut through the peninsula.[472] No exact estimate can be\r\ngiven of the original area of the castle, as so much of the cliff has\r\nbeen carried away by the sea.\r\n\r\nHastings itself had been a fortified town before the Norman Conquest,\r\nand is one of those mentioned in the _Burghal Hidage_. The name\r\nHæstingaceaster, given to it in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ (1050), is\r\na proof that the Saxons used the name _chester_ for constructions of\r\ntheir own, as no Roman remains have been found at Hastings. But the\r\nNorman castle is outside the town, on a cliff which overlooks it. As in\r\nthe case of the other ports of Sussex, the castle was committed to an\r\nimportant noble, in this case the Count of Eu.\r\n\r\nThe manor of Bexley, in which Hastings Castle stood, had been laid\r\nwaste at the Conquest; at the date of the Survey it was again rising in\r\nvalue, though it had not reached the figure of King Edward's days.[473]\r\n\r\nHEREFORD.--There can be little doubt that the castle of Hereford was\r\nbuilt by the Norman Ralph, Earl of Hereford, Edward the Confessor's\r\nnephew, about the year 1048.[474] It was burnt by the Welsh in 1055,\r\nafter which Harold fortified the town with a dyke and ditch; but as Mr\r\nFreeman remarks, it is not said that he restored the castle.[475] The\r\nmotte of Earl Ralph is now completely levelled, but it is mentioned\r\nseveral times in documents of the 12th century,[476] and is described\r\nin a survey of 1652, from which it appears that it had a stone keep\r\ntower, as well as a stone breastwork enclosing a small ward.[477]\r\nIt stood outside the N.W. corner of the bailey, surrounded by its\r\nown ditch; the site is still called Castle Hill. If the castle was\r\nnot restored before the Norman Conquest it was certainly restored\r\nafterwards, as in 1067 we find the \"men of the castle\" fighting with\r\nEdric Child and the Welsh. The castle appears to have had stone walls\r\nby the time of Henry II., as the mention of a kiln for their repair\r\nproves.[478] But these walls had wooden towers.[479] The timber ordered\r\nin 1213 \"ad hordiandum castellum nostrum de Hereford\"[480] refers to\r\nthe wooden _alures_ or machicolations which were placed on the tops of\r\nwalls for the purpose of defending the bases.\r\n\r\nThough Hereford was a private castle in the Confessor's reign, it was\r\nclaimed for the crown by Archbishop Hubert, the Justiciary, in 1197,\r\nand continued to be a royal castle throughout the 13th century.[481]\r\n\r\nThe bailey of Hereford Castle still exists, with its fine banks; it is\r\nkite-shaped and encloses 5-1/2 acres. The castle stood within the city\r\nwalls, in the south-east angle.\r\n\r\nThe value of Hereford appears to have greatly increased at the date of\r\nthe Survey.[482]\r\n\r\nHUNTINGDON (Fig. 18).--\"There were twenty houses on the site of the\r\ncastle, which are now gone.\"[483] Ordericus tells us that the castle\r\nof Huntingdon was built by William on his return from his second visit\r\nto York in 1068.[484] Huntingdon had been a walled town in Anglo-Saxon\r\ntimes, and was very likely first fortified by the Danes, but was\r\nrepaired by Edward the Elder. As in the case of so many other towns,\r\nthe houses outside the walls had to pay geld along with those of the\r\ncity, and it was some of the former which were displaced by the new\r\nNorman castle. Huntingdon was part of the patrimony of Earl Waltheof,\r\nand came to the Norman, Simon de Senlis, through his marriage with\r\nWaltheof's daughter and heiress. The line of Senlis ended in another\r\nheiress, who married David, afterwards the famous king of Scotland;\r\nDavid thus became Earl of Huntingdon. In the insurrection of the\r\nyounger Henry in 1174, William the Lion, grandson of David, took\r\nsides with the young king, and consequently his castle was besieged\r\nand taken by the forces of Henry II.,[485] and the king ordered it to\r\nbe destroyed. The _Pipe Rolls_ show that this order was carried out,\r\nas they contain a bill for \"hooks for pulling down the stockade of\r\nHuntingdon Castle,\" and \"for the work of the new castle at Huntingdon,\r\nand for hiring carpenters, and crooks, and axes.\"[486] We learn from\r\nthese entries that the original castle of the Conquest had just been\r\nreplaced by a new one, very likely a new fortification of the old\r\nmounds by William, in anticipation of the insurrection. We also learn\r\nthat the new castle was a wooden one; for a castle which has to be\r\npulled down by carpenters with hooks and axes is certainly not of\r\nstone. It does not appear that the castle was ever restored, though\r\n\"the chapel of the castle\" is spoken of as late as the reign of Henry\r\nIII.[487]\r\n\r\nThe motte of Huntingdon still exists, and has not the slightest sign of\r\nmasonry. The bailey is roughly square, with the usual rounded corners;\r\nthe motte was inside this enclosure, but had its own ditch. The whole\r\narea was 2-1/2 acres, but another bailey was subsequently added.\r\n\r\nThe value of Huntingdon appears to have been stationary at the time\r\nof the Survey, the loss of the twenty houses causing a diminution of\r\nrevenue which must have been made up from the new feudal dues of the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nLAUNCESTON, or Dunheved,[488] Cornwall (Fig. 19).--There, says Domesday\r\nBook, is the castle of the Earl of Mortain.[489] In another place it\r\ntells us that the earl gave two manors to the bishop of Exeter \"for\r\nthe exchange of the castle of Cornwall,\" another name for Dunheved\r\nCastle. We have already had occasion to note that the \"exchange of the\r\ncastle,\" in Domesday language, is an abbreviation for the exchange of\r\nthe site of the castle. The fact that the land was obtained from the\r\nchurch is a proof that the castle was new, for it was not the custom of\r\nSaxon prelates thus to fortify themselves. The motte of Launceston is\r\na knoll of natural rock, which has been scarped and heightened by art.\r\nThis motte now carries a circular keep, which cannot be earlier than\r\nthe 13th century.[490] There is no early Norman work whatever about\r\nthe masonry of the castle, and the remarkably elaborate fortifications\r\non the motte belong to a much later period.[491] The motte rises in\r\none corner of a roughly rectangular bailey, which covers 3 acres. It\r\nstands outside the town walls, which still exist, and join those of\r\nthe castle, as at Totnes. Launceston was only a small manor of ten\r\nploughs in the time of the Confessor. In spite of the building of\r\nthe castle, the value of the manor had greatly gone down in William's\r\ntime.[492] The ten ploughs had been reduced to five.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Launceston, Cornwall. Lewes, Sussex.]\r\n\r\nLEWES, Sussex (Fig. 19).--The castle of Lewes is not mentioned in its\r\nproper place in Sussex by Domesday Book, and this is another proof that\r\nthe Survey contains no inventory of castles; for that the castle was\r\nexisting at that date is rendered certain by the numerous allusions\r\nin the Norfolk portion to \"the exchange of the castle of Lewes.\"[493]\r\nIt is clear that at some period, possibly during the revolt of Robert\r\nCurthose in 1079, William I. gave large estates in Norfolk to his\r\ntrusty servant, William de Warenne, in exchange for the important\r\ncastle of Lewes, which he may have preferred to keep in his own hands\r\nat that critical period. This bargain cannot have held long, at least\r\nas regards the castle, which continued to belong to the Warenne family\r\nfor many generations. We cannot even guess now how the matter was\r\nsettled, but the lands in Norfolk certainly remained in the hands of\r\nthe Warennes.\r\n\r\nLewes is one of the very few castles in England which have two\r\nmottes.[494] They were placed at each end of an oval bailey, each\r\nsurrounded by its own ditch, and each projecting about three-fourths\r\nbeyond the line of the bailey. On the northern motte only the\r\nfoundations of a wall round the top remain; on the other, part of the\r\nwall which enclosed a small ward, and two mural towers. These towers\r\nhave signs of the early Perpendicular period, and are very likely of\r\nthe reign of Edward III., when the castle passed into the hands of\r\nthe Fitz Alans. The bailey, which enclosed an area of about 3 acres,\r\nis now covered with houses and gardens, but parts of the curtain wall\r\non the S.E. and E. stand on banks, bearing witness to the original\r\nwooden fortifications. The great interest of this bailey is its ancient\r\nNorman gateway. The entrance was regarded by mediæval architects as the\r\nweakest part of the fortress, and we frequently find that it was the\r\nfirst part to receive stone defences.[495] It is not surprising that\r\nat such an important place as Lewes, which was then a port leading to\r\nNormandy, and at the castle of so powerful a noble, we should find an\r\nearly case of stone architecture supplementing the wooden defences.\r\nBut the two artificial mottes have no masonry that can be called early\r\nNorman.\r\n\r\nLewes is one of the boroughs mentioned in the _Burghal Hidage_, and was\r\na _burgus_ at the time of the Survey.[496] The value of the town had\r\nincreased by £1, 18s. from what it had been in King Edward's time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. LINCOLN.]\r\n\r\nLINCOLN (Fig. 20).--Domesday Book tells us that 166 houses were\r\ndestroyed to furnish the site of the castle.[497] The _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_ says that William built a castle here on his return from\r\nhis first visit to York in 1068, and Ordericus makes the same\r\nstatement.[498] Lincoln, like Exeter, was a Roman _castrum_, and the\r\nNorman castle in both cases was placed in one corner of the castrum;\r\nbut the old Roman wall of Lincoln, which stands on the natural ground,\r\nwas not considered to be a sufficient defence on the two exterior\r\nsides, probably on account of its ruinous condition. It was therefore\r\nburied in a very high and steep bank, which was carried all round the\r\nnew castle.[499] This circumstance seems to point to the haste with\r\nwhich the castle was built, Lincoln being then for the first time\r\nsubdued. The fact that it was inside the probably closely packed Roman\r\nwalls explains why so many houses were destroyed for the castle.[500]\r\nLincoln, like Lewes, has two mottes: both are of about the same height,\r\nbut the one in the middle of the southern line of defence is the larger\r\nand more important; it was originally surrounded with its own ditch. It\r\nis now crowned with a polygonal shell wall, which may have been built\r\nby the mother of Ralph Gernon, Earl of Chester, in the reign of Henry\r\nI.[501] The tower on the other motte, at the south-east corner, has\r\nbeen largely rebuilt in the 14th century and added to in modern times,\r\nbut its lower storey still retains work of Norman character. There is\r\ngood reason to suppose that this bailey was first walled with stone\r\nin Richard I.'s reign, as there is an entry in the _Pipe Rolls_ of\r\n1193-1194 \"for the cost of fortifying the bailey, £82, 16s. 4d.\"[502]\r\nThe present wall contains a good deal of herring-bone work, and this\r\ncircumstance led Mr Clark, who was looking for something which he\r\n_could_ put down to William I.'s time, to believe that the walls were\r\nof that date. But the herring-bone work is all in patches, as though\r\nfor repairs, and herring-bone work was used for repairs at all epochs\r\nof mediæval building. The two gateways (that is the Norman portions of\r\nthem) are probably of about the same date as the castle wall. The whole\r\narea is 5-3/4 acres.\r\n\r\nThe total revenue which the city of Lincoln paid to the king and the\r\nearl had gone up from 30_l._ T. R. E. to 100_l._ T. R. W. For the sake\r\nof those who imagine that Saxon halls had anything to do with mottes,\r\nit is worth noting that the hall which was the residence of the chief\r\nlandholder in Lincoln before the Conquest was still in existence after\r\nthe building of the castle, but evidently had no connection with\r\nit.[503]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. Monmouth. Montacute, Somerset. Morpeth,\r\nNorthumberland.]\r\n\r\nMONMOUTH (Fig. 21).--Domesday Book says that the king has four ploughs\r\nin demesne in the castle of Monmouth.[504] Dr Round regards this as\r\none of the cases where _castellum_ is to be interpreted as a town and\r\nnot as a castle. However this may be, the existence of a Norman castle\r\nat Monmouth is rendered certain by a passage in the _Book of Llandaff_,\r\nin which it is said that this castle was built by William FitzOsbern,\r\nand a short history of it is given, which brings it up to the days of\r\nWilliam Fitz Baderun.[505] Speed speaks of this castle as \"standing\r\nmounted round in compasse, and within her walls another mount, whereon\r\na Towre of great height and strength is built.\"[506] This sounds like\r\nthe description of a motte and bailey; but the motte cannot be traced\r\nnow. It is possible that it may have been swept away to build the\r\npresent barracks; the whole castle is now on a flat-topped hill. The\r\narea is 1-3/4 acres.[507]\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor before the Conquest is not given.\r\n\r\nMONTACUTE, Somerset (Fig. 21).--This is another instance of a site for\r\na castle obtained by exchange from the church. Count Robert of Mortain\r\ngave the manor of Candel to the priory of Athelney in exchange for\r\nthe manor of Bishopstowe, \"and there is his castle, which is called\r\nMontagud.\"[508] The English name for the village at the foot of the\r\nhill was Ludgarsburh, which does not point to any fortification on the\r\nhill itself, the spot where the wonder-working crucifix of Waltham was\r\nfound in Saxon times. Robert of Mortain's son William gave the castle\r\nof Montacute, with its chapel, orchard, and other appurtenances, to a\r\npriory of Cluniac monks which he founded close to it. The gift may have\r\nhad something compulsory in it, for William of Mortain was banished\r\nby Henry I. in 1104 as a partisan of Robert Curthose. Thus, as Leland\r\nsays, \"the notable castle partly fell to ruin, and partly was taken\r\ndown to make the priory, so that many years since no building of it\r\nremained; only a chapel was set upon the very top of the dungeon, and\r\nthat yet standeth there.\"[509] There is still a high oval motte, having\r\na ditch between its base and the bailey; the latter is semilunar in\r\nshape. The hill has been much terraced on the eastern side, but this\r\nmay have been the work of the monks, for purposes of cultivation.[510]\r\nThere is no masonry except a quite modern tower. According to Mr Clark,\r\nthe motte is of natural rock. The French name of the castle was of\r\ncourse imported from Normandy, and we generally find that an English\r\ncastle with a Norman-French name of this kind has a motte.[511]\r\n\r\nBishopstowe, in which the castle was placed, was not a large manor in\r\nSaxon times. Its value T. R. E. is not given in the Survey, but we\r\nare told that it is worth 6_l._ to the earl, and 3_l._ 3_s._ to the\r\nknights who hold under him.\r\n\r\nMORPETH, Northumberland (Fig. 21).--There is only one mention known\r\nto us of Morpeth Castle in the 11th century, and that is in the\r\npoem of Geoffrey Gaimar.[512] He says that William Rufus, when\r\nmarching to Bamborough, to repress the rebellion of Mowbray, Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, \"took the strong castle of Morpeth, which was seated\r\non a little mount,\" and belonged to William de Morlei. Thus there\r\ncan be no doubt that the Ha' Hill, about 100 yards to the N. of the\r\npresent castle, was the motte of the first castle of Morpeth, though\r\nthe remains of the motte, which are mentioned by Hodgson, have been\r\ndestroyed.[513] A natural ridge has been used to form a castle by\r\ncutting off its higher end to form a motte, and making a court on the\r\nlower part of the ridge. The great steepness of the slopes rendered\r\nordinary ditches unnecessary, nor are there any traces now of banks or\r\nfoundations. In the court some Norman capitals and carved stones were\r\nfound in 1830. This early castle was admirably placed for commanding\r\nthe river and the bridge.[514] The present castle of Morpeth was built\r\nin 1342-1349.[515]\r\n\r\nNEWCASTLE, Northumberland.--The first castle here was built by\r\nRobert, son of William I., on his return from his expedition to\r\nScotland in 1080.[516] It was of the usual motte-and-bailey kind, the\r\nmotte standing in a small bailey which was rectilinear and roughly\r\noblong.[517] This motte was in existence when Brand wrote his _History\r\nof Newcastle_, but was removed in 1811. The castle was placed outside\r\nthe Roman station at Monkchester, and commanded a Roman bridge over the\r\nTyne, \"and to the north-east overlooked a ravine that under the name of\r\nThe Side formed for centuries a main artery of communication between\r\nEngland and Scotland.\"[518] Henry II., when he built the fine keep of\r\nthis castle, did not place it on the motte, but in the outer and larger\r\nward, which was roughly triangular. The outer curtain appears to have\r\nstood on the banks of the former earthen castle, as the Parliamentary\r\nSurvey of 1649 speaks of the castle as \"bounded with strong works of\r\nstone and mud.\"[519] The area of the whole castle was 3 acres and 1\r\nrood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. Norham. Nottingham.]\r\n\r\nNORHAM, Northumberland (Fig. 22).--The first castle here was built\r\nby Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, in the reign of William Rufus.\r\nIt was built to defend Northumberland against the incursions of the\r\nScots, and we are expressly told that no castle had existed there\r\npreviously.[520] This first castle, which we may certainly assume to\r\nhave been of earth and wood, was destroyed by the Scots in 1138, and\r\nthere does not seem to have been any stone castle until the time of\r\nBishop Puiset or Pudsey, who built the present keep by command of King\r\nHenry II.[521] Mr Clark tried hard to find some work of Flambard's in\r\nthis tower, but found it difficult, and was driven back on the rather\r\nlame assumption that \"the lapse of forty [really fifty at least] years\r\nhad not materially changed the style of architecture then in use.\"[522]\r\nIn fact, the Norman parts of this keep show no work so early as the\r\n11th century, but are advanced in style, for not only was the basement\r\nvaulted, but the first floor also. The simple explanation is that\r\nFlambard threw up the large square motte on which the keep now stands,\r\nand provided it with the usual wooden defences. It also had a strong\r\ntower, but almost certainly a wooden one; hence it was easily destroyed\r\nby the Scots when once taken.[523] The motte was probably lowered to\r\nsome extent when the stone keep was built. It stands on a high bank\r\noverlooking the Tweed, and is separated from its bailey by a deep\r\nditch. The bailey may be described as a segment of a circle; its area\r\nis about 2 acres.\r\n\r\nNORWICH (Fig. 23).--We find from Domesday Book that no less than 113\r\nhouses were destroyed for the site of this castle, a certain proof that\r\nthe castle was new.[524] It is highly probable that it was outside the\r\nprimitive defences of the town, at any rate in part. Norwich was built,\r\npartly on a peninsula formed by a double bend of the river Wensum,\r\npartly in a district lying south-west of this peninsula, and defended\r\nby a ridge of rising ground running in a north-easterly direction. The\r\ncastle was placed on the edge of this ridge, and all the oldest part\r\nof the town, including the most ancient churches, lies to the east of\r\nit.[525] In the conjectural map of Norwich in 1100, given in Woodward's\r\n_History of Norwich Castle_,[526] the street called Burg Street divides\r\nthe Old Burg on the east from the New Burg on the west; this street\r\nruns along a ridge which traverses the neck of the peninsula from\r\nsouth-west to north-east, and on the northern end of this ridge the\r\ncastle stands.[527] There can be little doubt that this street marks\r\nthe line of the _burh_ or enclosing bank by which the primitive town\r\nof Norwich was defended.[528] A clear proof of this lies in the fact\r\nthat the castle of Norwich was anciently not in the jurisdiction of the\r\ncity, but in that of the county; the citizens had no authority over the\r\nhouses lying beyond the castle ditches until it was expressly granted\r\nto them by Edward III.[529] The mediæval walls of Norwich, vastly\r\nextending the borders of the city, were not built till Henry III.'s\r\nreign.[530]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. Norwich.\r\n\r\n(From Harrod's \"Gleanings among the Castles and Convents of Norfolk,\"\r\np. 133.)]\r\n\r\nThe motte of Norwich Castle, according to recent investigations,\r\nis entirely artificial;[531] it was originally square, and had \"a\r\nprodigious large and deep ditch around it.\"[532] The fancy of the\r\nantiquary Wilkins that the motte was the centre of two concentric\r\noutworks[533] was completely disproved by Mr Harrod, who showed that\r\nthe original castle was a motte with one of the ordinary half-moon\r\nbaileys attached. Another ward, called the Castle Meadow, was probably\r\nadded at a later date. The magnificent keep which now stands on the\r\nmotte is undoubtedly a work of the 12th century.[534] The castle which\r\nEmma, wife of Earl Ralf Guader, defended against the Conqueror after\r\nthe celebrated bride-ale of Norwich was almost certainly a wooden\r\nstructure. As late as the year 1172 the bailey was still defended by\r\na wooden stockade and wooden bretasches;[535] and even in 1225 the\r\nstockade had not been replaced by a stone wall.[536]\r\n\r\nNorwich was a royal castle, and consequently always in the hands of the\r\nsheriff; it was never the property of the Bigods.[537] As the fable\r\nthat extensive lands belonging to the monastery of Ely were held on the\r\ntenure of castle guard at Norwich _before the Conquest_ is repeated\r\nby all the local historians,[538] it is worth while to note that the\r\ncharters of Henry I. setting the convent free from this service, make\r\nno allusion to any such ancient date for it,[539] and that the tenure\r\nof castle guard is completely unknown to the Anglo-Saxon laws. The area\r\nof the inner bailey is 3-1/4 acres, and that of the outer, 4-1/2 acres.\r\nThe value of Norwich had greatly risen since the Conquest.[540]\r\n\r\nNOTTINGHAM (Fig. 22).--This important castle is not mentioned in\r\nDomesday Book, but the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ says that William I.\r\nbuilt the castle at Nottingham in 1067, on his way to repress the\r\nfirst insurrection in Yorkshire. Ordericus, repeating this statement,\r\nadds that he committed it to the keeping of William Peverel.[541]\r\nThe castle was placed on a lofty headland at some distance from the\r\nDanish borough, and between the two arose the Norman borough which is\r\nmentioned in Domesday Book as the _novus burgus_. The two upper wards\r\nof the present castle probably represent William's plan. The upper ward\r\nforms a natural motte of rock, as it is 15 feet higher than the bailey\r\nattached to it, and has been separated from it by a ditch cut across\r\nthe rocky headland, which can still be traced below the modern house\r\nwhich now stands on the motte. Such a site was not only treated as a\r\nmotte, but was actually called by that name, as we read of the _mota_\r\nof Nottingham Castle in the _Pipe Rolls_ of both John's and Richard\r\nI.'s reigns.\r\n\r\nMr Clark published a bird's-eye view of Nottingham Castle in his\r\n_Mediæval Military Architecture_, about which he only stated that it\r\nwas taken from the _Illustrated London News_. It does not agree with\r\nthe plan made by Simpson in 1617,[542] and is therefore not quite\r\ntrustworthy; the position of the keep, for example, is quite different.\r\nThe keep, which Hutchison in his Memoirs speaks of as \"the strong tower\r\ncalled the Old Tower on the top of the rock,\" seems clearly Norman,\r\nfrom the buttresses. It was placed (according to Simpson's plan), on\r\nthe north side of the small ward which formed the top of the motte,\r\nand was enclosed in a yet older shell wall which has now disappeared.\r\nThe height of this motte is indicated in the bird's-eye view by the\r\nascending wall which leads up it from the bailey. It had its own ditch,\r\nas appears by several mentions in the accounts of \"the drawbridge of\r\nthe keep,\" and \"the bridge leading up to the dongeon.\"[543] It is\r\nhighly probable that this keep was built by King John, as in a _Mise\r\nRoll_ of 1212 there is a payment entered \"towards making the tower\r\nwhich the king commanded to be built on the motte of Nottingham.\"[544]\r\nBut the first masonry in the castle was probably the work of Henry\r\nII., who spent £1737, 9s. 5d. on the castle and houses, the gaol, the\r\nking's chamber, the hall, and in raising the walls and enclosing the\r\nbailey.[545] The castle has been so devastated by the 17th century\r\nspoiler, that the work of Henry and John has been almost entirely\r\nswept away, but the one round tower which still remains as part of\r\nthe defences of the inner bailey, looks as though it might be of the\r\ntime of Henry II. This bailey is semicircular; the whole original\r\ncastle covers only 1-2/3 acres. A very much larger bailey was added\r\nafterwards, probably in John's reign.[546] Probably this later bailey\r\nwas at first enclosed with a bank and stockade, and this stockade may\r\nbe the palitium of which there are notices in the records of Henry\r\nIII. and Edward I.[547] The main gateway of this bailey, which still\r\nremains, is probably of Edward I. or Edward II.'s reign.[548]\r\n\r\nThe castle of Nottingham was the most important one in the Midlands,\r\nand William of Newburgh speaks of it as \"so well defended by nature and\r\nart that it appears impregnable.\"[549] The value of the town had risen\r\nfrom £18 to £30 at the time of the Survey.[550]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. Okehampton, Devon. Penwortham, Lancs. Pevensey,\r\nSussex.]\r\n\r\nOKEHAMPTON, Devon (Fig. 24).--Baldwin de Molis, Sheriff of Devon, held\r\nthe manor of Okehampton at the time of the Survey, and had a castle\r\nthere.[551] On a hill in the valley of the Okement River stand the\r\nremains of a castle of the motte-and-bailey pattern. On the motte,\r\nwhich is high and steep, are the ruins of a keep of late character,\r\nprobably of the 14th century.[552] The oval bailey covers 1/2 an acre,\r\nand the whole castle is surrounded with a very deep ditch (filled up\r\nnow on the east side) which is in part a natural ravine. The usual\r\nditch between the motte and the bailey is absent here. This castle\r\nappears to have continued always in private hands, and therefore there\r\nis little to be learned about it from the public records. The value of\r\nOkehampton manor had increased since the Conquest from £8 to £10. As\r\nthere is no _burgus_ mentioned T. R. E., but four _burgenses_ and a\r\nmarket T. R. W., Baldwin the Sheriff must have built a borough as well\r\nas a castle. Otherwise it was a small manor of thirty ploughs.\r\n\r\nOSWESTRY, Shropshire.--Mr Eyton's identification of the Domesday castle\r\nof Louvre, in the manor of Meresberie, Shropshire, with Oswestry, seems\r\nto be decisive.[553] The name is simply L'Oeuvre, the Work, a name\r\nvery frequently given to castles in the early Norman period. Domesday\r\nBook says that Rainald de Bailleul built a castle at this place.[554]\r\nHe had married the widow of Warin, Sheriff of Shropshire, who died in\r\n1085. The castle afterwards passed into the hands of the Fitz Alans,\r\ngreat lords-marcher on the Welsh border. As the Welsh annals give the\r\ncredit of building the castle to Madoc ap Meredith, into whose hands it\r\nfell during the reign of Stephen, it is not impossible that some of the\r\nmasonry still existing on the motte, which consists of large cobbles\r\nbedded in very thick mortar, may be his work, and probably the first\r\nstonework in the castle. A sketch made in the 18th century, however,\r\nwhich is the only drawing preserved of the castle, seems to show\r\narchitecture of the Perpendicular period.[555] But probably the keep\r\nalone was of masonry in the 12th century, as in 1166, when the castle\r\nwas in royal custody, the repair of the stockade is referred to in the\r\n_Pipe Rolls_.[556] No plan has been preserved of Oswestry Castle, so\r\nthat it is impossible to recover the shape or area of the bailey, which\r\nis now built over. The manor of Meresberie had been unoccupied (wasta)\r\nin the days of King Edward, but it yielded 40s. at the date of the\r\nSurvey. Eyton gives reasons for thinking that the town of Oswestry was\r\nfounded by the Normans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. Oxford.\r\n\r\n(From \"Oxonia Illustrata,\" David Loggan, 1675.)]\r\n\r\nOXFORD (Fig. 25).--This castle was built in 1071 by Robert d'Oilgi (or\r\nd'Oilly), a Norman who received large estates in Oxfordshire.[557]\r\nOxford was a burgus in Saxon times, and is one of those mentioned in\r\nthe _Burghal Hidage_. Domesday tells us that the king has twenty mural\r\nmansions there, which had belonged to Algar, Earl of Mercia, and that\r\nthey were called mural mansions because their owners had to repair the\r\ncity wall at the king's behest, a regulation probably as old as the\r\ndays of Alfred. The Norman castle was placed outside the town walls,\r\nbut near the river, from which its trenches were fed.[558] It was\r\nwithout doubt a motte-and-bailey castle; the motte still remains, and\r\nthe accompanying bird's-eye view by David Loggan, 1675, shows that the\r\nlater stone walls of the bailey stood on the earthen banks of D'Oilly's\r\ncastle. The site is now occupied by a gaol. On the line of the walls\r\nrises the ancient tower of St George's Church, which so much resembles\r\nan early Norman keep that we might think it was intended for one, if\r\nthe Osney chronicler had not expressly told us that the church was\r\nfounded two years after the castle.[559] It is evident that the design\r\nwas to make the church tower work as a mural tower, a combination of\r\npiety and worldly wisdom quite in accord with what the chronicler tells\r\nus of the character of Roger d'Oilly.\r\n\r\nHenry II. spent some £260 on this castle between the years 1165 and\r\n1173, the houses in the keep, and the well being specially mentioned.\r\nWe may presume that he built with stone the decagonal [shell?] keep on\r\nthe motte, whose foundations were discovered at the end of the 18th\r\ncentury.[560] There is still in the heart of the motte a well in a very\r\nremarkable well chamber, the masonry of which may be of his time. The\r\narea of the bailey appears to have been 3 acres.\r\n\r\nThe value of the city of Oxford had trebled at the time of the Domesday\r\nSurvey.[561]\r\n\r\nIn the treaty between Stephen and Henry in 1153 the whole castle of\r\nOxford is spoken of as the \"Mota\" of Oxford.[562]\r\n\r\nPEAK CASTLE, Derbyshire.--The Survey simply calls this castle the\r\nCastle of William Peverel, but tells us that two Saxons had formerly\r\nheld the _land_.[563] There is no motte here, but the strong position,\r\ndefended on two sides by frightful precipices, rendered very little\r\nfortification necessary. It is possible that the wall on the N. and\r\nW. sides of the area may be, in part at least, the work of William\r\nPeverel; the W. wall contains a great deal of herring-bone work, and\r\nthe tower at the N.W. angle does not flank at all, while the other\r\none in the N. wall only projects a few feet; the poor remains of\r\nthe gatehouse also appear to be Norman. It would probably be easier\r\nto build a wall than to raise an earthbank in this stony country;\r\nnevertheless, behind the modern wall which runs up from the gatehouse\r\nto the keep, something like an earthbank may be observed on the edge of\r\nthe precipice, which ought to be examined before any conclusions are\r\ndetermined as to the first fortifications of this castle. The keep,\r\nwhich is of different stone to the other towers and the walls, stands\r\non the highest ground in the area, apparently on the natural rock,\r\nwhich crops up in the basement. It is undoubtedly the work of Henry\r\nII., as the accounts for it remain in the _Pipe Rolls_, and the slight\r\nindications of style which it displays, such as the nook-shafts at the\r\nangles, correspond to the Transition Norman period.[564] The shape of\r\nthe bailey is a quadrant; its area scarcely exceeds 1 acre.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor had risen since the Conquest, and William\r\nPeverel had doubled the number of ploughs in the demesne. The castle\r\nonly remained in the hands of the Peverels for two generations, and was\r\nthen forfeited to the crown. The manor was only a small one; and the\r\nsite of the castle was probably chosen for its natural advantages and\r\nfor the facility of hunting in the Peak Forest.\r\n\r\nPENWORTHAM, Lancashire (Fig. 24).--\"King Edward held Peneverdant. There\r\nare two carucates of land there, and they used to pay ten pence. Now\r\nthere is a castle there, and there are two ploughs in the demesne,\r\nand six burghers, and three radmen, and eight villeins, and four\r\ncowherds. Amongst them all they have four ploughs. There is half a\r\nfishery there. There is wood and hawk's eyries, as in King Edward's\r\ntime. It is worth £3.\"[565] The very great rise in value in this\r\nmanor shows that some great change had taken place since the Norman\r\nConquest. This change was the building of a castle. The _modo_ of\r\nDomesday always expresses a contrast with King Edward's time, and\r\nclearly tells us here that Penwortham Castle was new.[566] It lay in\r\nthe extensive lands between the Ribble and the Mersey, which were part\r\nof the Conqueror's enfeoffment of Roger the Poitevin, third son of Earl\r\nRoger de Montgomeri.[567] Since Penwortham is mentioned as demesne,\r\nand no under-tenant is spoken of, we may perhaps assume that this\r\ncastle, which was the head of a barony, was built by Roger himself.\r\nHe did not hold it long, as he forfeited all his estates in 1102. At\r\na later period, though we have not been able to trace when, the manor\r\nof Penwortham passed into the hands of the monks of Evesham, to whom\r\nthe church had already been granted, at the end of the Conqueror's\r\nreign.[568] Probably it is because the castle thus passed into the\r\nhands of the church that it never developed into a stone castle, like\r\nClitheroe. The seat of the barony was transferred elsewhere, and\r\nprobably the timbers of the castle were used in the monastic buildings\r\nof Penwortham Priory.\r\n\r\nThe excavations which were made here in 1856 proved conclusively that\r\nthere were no stone foundations on the Castle Hill at Penwortham.[569]\r\nThese excavations revealed the singular fact that the Norman had thrown\r\nup his motte on the site of a British or Romano-British hut, without\r\neven being aware of it, since the ruins of the hut were buried 5 feet\r\ndeep and covered by a grass-grown surface, on which the Norman had laid\r\na rude pavement of boulders before piling his motte.[570] Among the\r\nobjects found in the excavations was a Norman prick spur, a conclusive\r\nproof of the Norman origin of the motte.[571] No remains appear to have\r\nbeen found of the Norman wooden keep; but this would be accounted for\r\nby the theory suggested above.\r\n\r\nPenwortham is a double motte, the artificial hill rising on the back of\r\na natural hill, which has been isolated from its continuing ridge by an\r\nartificial ditch cut through it. The double hill rises out of a bailey\r\ncourt which is rudely square, but whose shape is determined by the\r\nground, which forms a headland running out into the Ribble. The whole\r\narea cannot certainly be ascertained. There was a ferry at this point\r\nin Norman times.[572] The castle defends the mouth of the Ribble and\r\noverlooks the town of Preston.\r\n\r\nPenwortham was certainly not the _caput_ of a large soke in Saxon\r\ntimes, as it was only a berewick of Blackburn, in which hundred it lay.\r\nIt was the Norman who first made it the seat of a barony.\r\n\r\nPETERBOROUGH.--The chronicler, Hugh Candidus, tells us that Abbot\r\nThorold, the Norman abbot whom William I. appointed to the ancient\r\nminster of Peterborough, built a castle close to the church, \"which in\r\nthese days is called Mount Torold.\"[573] This mount is still existing,\r\nbut it has lost its ancient name, and is now called Tout Hill. It\r\nstands in the Deanery garden, and has probably been largely ransacked\r\nfor garden soil, as it has a decayed and shapeless look. Still, it is a\r\nvenerable relic of Norman aggression, well authenticated.\r\n\r\nPEVENSEY, Sussex (Fig. 24).--The Roman castrum of Pevensey (still\r\nso striking in its remains) was an inhabited town at the date of\r\nthe Norman Conquest, and was an important port.[574] After taking\r\npossession of the castrum, William I. drew a strong bank across its\r\neastern end, and placed a castle in the area thus isolated. This first\r\ncastle was probably entirely of wood, as there was a wooden _palicium_\r\non the bank as late as the reign of Henry II.[575] But if a wooden keep\r\nwas built at first, it was very soon superseded by one of stone.[576]\r\nThe remains of this keep have recently been excavated by Mr Harold\r\nSands and Mr Montgomerie, and show it to have been a most remarkable\r\nbuilding[577] (see Chapter XII., p. 355)--in all probability one\r\nof the few 11th century keeps in England. We may perhaps attribute\r\nthis distinction to the fact that no less a man than the Conqueror's\r\nhalf-brother, the Count of Mortain, was made the guardian of this\r\nimportant port.\r\n\r\nPevensey is mentioned as a port in the _Close Rolls_ of Henry III.'s\r\nreign, and was one of the important waterways to the Continent.[578] As\r\nhas been already noted, the establishment of the castle was followed\r\nby the usual rise in the value of the _burgus_.[579] The area of the\r\ncastle covers 1 acre.\r\n\r\nPONTEFRACT, Yorkshire (Fig. 26).--This castle is not spoken of in\r\nDomesday by its French name, but there can be no doubt that it is \"the\r\nCastle of Ilbert\" which is twice mentioned and several times alluded to\r\nin the _Clamores_, or disputed claims, which are enrolled at the end of\r\nthe list of lands in Yorkshire belonging to the tenants-in-chief.[580]\r\nThe existence of Ilbert's castle at Pontefract in the 11th century is\r\nmade certain by a charter (only an early copy of which is now extant)\r\nin the archives of the Duchy of Lancaster, in which William Rufus at\r\nhis accession regrants to Ilbert de Lacy \"the custom of the castelry\r\nof his castle, as he had it in the Conqueror's days and in those of\r\nthe bishop of Bayeux.\"[581] As Mr Holmes remarks, this carries us back\r\nto four years before the compilation of Domesday Book, since Odo,\r\nBishop of Bayeux, whom William had left as regent during his absence in\r\nNormandy, was arrested and imprisoned in 1082.[582]\r\n\r\nPontefract is called Kirkby in some of the earlier charters, and this\r\nwas evidently the English (or rather the Danish) name of the place. It\r\nlay within the manor of Tateshall, which is supposed to be the same\r\nas Tanshelf, a name still preserved in the neighbourhood of, but not\r\nexactly at, Pontefract.[583] Tanshelf claims to be the Taddenescylf\r\nmentioned in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, where King Edgar received\r\nthe submission of the Yorkshire Danes in 947. There is no proof that\r\nthe hill at Kirkby was fortified before the Conquest. It was a steep\r\nheadland rising out of the plain of the Aire, and needing only to be\r\nscarped by art and to have a ditch cut across its neck to be almost\r\nimpregnable. It lay scarcely a mile east of the Roman road from\r\nDoncaster to Castleford and the north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. Pontefract, Yorks. Preston Capes, Northants.\r\nQuatford, Salop.]\r\n\r\nIt is no part of our task to trace the fortunes of this famous\r\ncastle, which was considered in the Middle Ages to be the key of\r\nYorkshire.[584] In spite of the labels affixed to the walls we venture\r\nto assert with confidence that none of the masonry now visible\r\nbelongs to the days of Ilbert. The structural history of the castle\r\nwas probably this: Ilbert de Lacy, one of the greatest of the Norman\r\ntenants-in-chief in Yorkshire,[585] built in this naturally defensive\r\nsituation a castle of earth and wood, like other Norman castles.\r\nWhether he found the place already defended by earthen banks we do not\r\nattempt to decide, but analogy makes it fairly certain that the motte\r\nwas his work, and was crowned by a wooden tower. This motte, which\r\nwas at least partially scarped out of the soft sandstone rock, is now\r\ndisguised by the remarkable keep which has been built up around it,\r\nconsisting at present of two enormous round towers and the ruins of a\r\nthird. As a fourth side is vacant, it may reasonably be conjectured\r\nthat there was a fourth roundel.[586] If the plan was a quatrefoil\r\nit resembled that of the keep of York, which is now ascertained to\r\nbelong to the reign of Henry III.; and the very little detail that is\r\nleft supports the view that Pontefract keep was copied from the royal\r\nexperiment at York, though it differed from it in that it actually\r\nrevetted the motte itself. There is no ditch now round the motte, but\r\nwe venture to think that its inner ditch is indicated by the position\r\nof the postern in Piper's Tower, which seems to mark its outlet.\r\nIt appears to have been partly filled up during the great siege of\r\nPontefract in 1648.[587] The platform which is attached to the motte\r\non the side facing the bailey is probably an addition of the same\r\ndate, intended for artillery; its retaining wall shows signs of hasty\r\nconstruction. A well chamber and a passage leading both to it and to a\r\npostern opening towards the outer ditch appear to have been made in the\r\nrocky base of the motte in the 13th century.\r\n\r\nThe area of the inner and probably original bailey of this castle,\r\nincluding the motte, is 2-1/3 acres. The Main Guard, and another bailey\r\ncovering the approach on the S. side, were probably later additions,\r\nbringing up the castle area to 7 acres. The shape of the first bailey\r\nis an irregular oval, determined by the hill on which it stands.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Tateshall had fallen at the time of the\r\nSurvey from £20 to £15, an unusual circumstance in the case of a manor\r\nwhich had become the seat of an important castle; but the number of\r\nploughs had decreased by half, and we may infer that Tateshall had not\r\nrecovered from the great devastation of Yorkshire in 1068.[588]\r\n\r\nPRESTON CAPES, Northants (Fig. 26).--That a castle of the 11th century\r\nstood here is only proved by a casual mention in the _Historia\r\nFundationis_ of the Cluniac priory of Daventry, which tells us\r\nthat this priory was first founded by Hugh de Leycestre, Seneschal\r\nof Matilda de Senlis, close to his own castle of Preston Capes,\r\nabout 1090. Want of water and the proximity of the castle proving\r\ninconvenient, the priory was removed to Daventry.[589] The work lies\r\nabout 3 miles from the Watling Street. The castle stands on a spur of\r\nhigh land projecting northwards towards a feeder of the river Nesse,\r\nabout 3 miles W. of the Watling Street. The works consist of a motte,\r\nhaving a flat top 80 to 90 feet in diameter, and remains of a slight\r\nbreastwork. This motte is placed on the edge of the plateau, and the\r\nground falls steeply round its northern half. About 16 feet down this\r\nslope, a ditch with an outer bank has been dug, embracing half the\r\nmound. Lower down, near the foot of the slope, is another and longer\r\nditch and rampart. It is probable that the bailey occupied the flatter\r\nground S.E. of the motte, but the site is occupied by a farm, and no\r\ntraces are visible.[590]\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Preston Capes had risen from 6s. to 40s.\r\nat the time of the Survey. It was held by Nigel of the Count of\r\nMellent.[591]\r\n\r\nQUATFORD, Shropshire (Fig. 26).--There can hardly be any doubt that the\r\n_nova domus_ at Quatford mentioned in the Survey was the new castle\r\nbuilt by Roger de Montgomeri, Earl of Shrewsbury. We have already\r\nsuggested that the _burgus_ which also existed there may have been his\r\nwork, and not that of the Danes.[592] The manor belonged to the church\r\nbefore the Conquest.[593] The oval motte, which still remains, is\r\ndescribed as placed on a bold rocky promontory jutting into the Severn;\r\nit is not quite 30 feet high, and about 60 feet by 120 in diameter\r\non top, and has a small bean-shaped bailey of 1 acre. It is near the\r\nchurch, which has Norman remains.[594] Robert Belesme, son of Earl\r\nRoger, removed the castle to Bridgenorth, and so the Quatford castle is\r\nheard of no more.[595] The manor of Quatford was paying nothing at the\r\ndate of the Survey.\r\n\r\nRAYLEIGH, Essex (Fig. 27).--\"In this manor Sweyn has made his\r\ncastle.\"[596] Sweyn was the son of Robert Fitz-Wymarc, a half English,\r\nhalf Norman favourite of Edward the Confessor. Robert was Sheriff of\r\nEssex under Edward and William, and Sweyn appears to have succeeded\r\nhis father in this office.[597] Sweyn built his castle on land which\r\nhad not belonged to his father, so Rayleigh cannot be the \"Robert's\r\nCastle\" of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, to which some of the Norman\r\nadventurers fled on the triumph of Earl Godwin.[598] There is a fine\r\nmotte at Rayleigh, and a semicircular bailey attached; the ditch round\r\nthe whole is still well marked. There is not a vestige of masonry\r\non the surface, but some excavations made in 1910 revealed stone\r\nfoundations. The inner bailey covers 3/4 of an acre. The value of the\r\nmanor had risen since the Conquest, but it was only a small one, with\r\nno villages in its soke.\r\n\r\nRICHARD'S CASTLE, Herefordshire (Fig. 27).--There can be little doubt\r\nthat this is the castle referred to in Domesday Book under the name\r\nof Avreton, as it is not far from Overton, on the northern border of\r\nHereford.[599] Richard's Castle is almost certainly the castle of\r\nRichard, son of Scrob, one of the Normans to whom Edward the Confessor\r\nhad granted large estates, and who probably fortified himself on this\r\nsite. At the time of the Survey Richard was dead, and the castle was\r\nheld by his son Osbern, and it is noted that he pays 10s., but the\r\ncastle is worth 20s. to him. Its value was the same as in King Edward's\r\ntime, a fact worth noting, as it coincides with the assumption that\r\nthis was a pre-Conquest castle. There is a high and steep motte at\r\nRichard's Castle, and a small half-moon shaped bailey.[600] There are\r\nremains of a stone wing wall running down the motte, and on the top\r\nthere is a straight piece of masonry which must be part of a tower\r\nkeep. The area of the inner bailey is 2/3 of an acre. Avreton was\r\nnot the centre of a soke, but appears to have lain in the manor of\r\nLudeford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. Rayleigh, Essex. Richard's Castle, Hereford.]\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, Yorks (Fig. 28).--As in the case of Pontefract, this other\r\ngreat Yorkshire castle is not mentioned by name in Domesday Book,\r\nnor is there any allusion to it except a casual mention in the\r\n_Recapitulation_ that Earl Alan has 199 manors in his castelry, and\r\nthat besides the castelry he has 43 manors.[601] The castle must have\r\nbeen built at the date of the Survey, which was completed only a year\r\nbefore William I.'s death; for during William's lifetime Earl Alan, the\r\nfirst holder of the fief, gave _the chapel in the castle of Richmond_\r\nto the abbey of St Mary at York, which he had founded.[602] The name,\r\nof course, is French, and it seems impossible now to discover what\r\nEnglish manor-name it has displaced.[603] It is certainly a case in\r\nwhich the Norman castle was not placed in the seat of the former Saxon\r\nproprietor, but in the site which seemed most defensible to the Norman\r\nlord. The lands of Earl Alan in the wapentake of Gilling had belonged\r\nto the Saxon Earl Edwin, and thus cannot have fallen to Alan's share\r\nbefore Edwin's death in 1071. The _Genealogia_ published by Dodsworth\r\n(from an MS. compiled in the reign of Edward III.), says that Earl\r\nAlan first built Richmond Castle near his chief manor of Gilling, to\r\ndefend his people against the attacks of the disinherited English and\r\nDanes.[604] The passage has been enlarged by Camden, who says that\r\nAlan \"thought himself not safe enough in Gilling\"; and this has been\r\ninterpreted to mean that Alan originally built his castle at Gilling,\r\nand afterwards removed it to Richmond; but the original words have no\r\nsuch meaning.[605]\r\n\r\nRichmond Castle differs from most of the castles mentioned in Domesday\r\nin that it has no motte. The ground plan indeed was very like that\r\nof a motte-and-bailey castle, in that old maps show a small roundish\r\nenclosure at the apex of the large triangular bailey.[606] But a recent\r\nexamination of the keep by Messrs Hope and Brakespear has confirmed\r\nthe theory first enunciated by Mr Loftus Brock,[607] that the keep\r\nis built over the original gateway of the castle, and that the lower\r\nstage of its front wall is the ancient wall of the castle. The small\r\nward indicated in the old maps is therefore most likely a barbican,\r\nof later date than the 12th century keep, which is probably rightly\r\nattributed by the _Genealogia_ cited above to Earl Conan, who reigned\r\nfrom 1148-1171.[608] Some entries in the _Pipe Rolls_ make it almost\r\ncertain that it was finished by Henry II., who kept the castle in\r\nhis own hands for some time after the death of Conan.[609] There are\r\nsome indications at Richmond that the first castle was of stone and not\r\nof earth and wood. The walls do not stand on earthen banks; the Norman\r\ncurtain can still be traced on two sides of the castle, and on the\r\nwest side it seems of early construction, containing a great deal of\r\nherringbone work, and might possibly be the work of Earl Alan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Richmond, Yorks. Rochester, Kent.]\r\n\r\nThe whole area of the castle is 2-1/2 acres, including the annexe known\r\nas the Cockpit. This was certainly enclosed during the Norman period,\r\nas it has a Norman gateway in its wall.\r\n\r\nAs we do not know the name of the site of Richmond before the Conquest,\r\nand as the name of Richmond is not mentioned in Domesday Book, we\r\ncannot tell whether the value of the manor had risen or fallen. But no\r\npart of Yorkshire was more flourishing at the time of the Survey than\r\nthis wapentake of Gilling, which belonged to Earl Alan; in no district,\r\nexcept in the immediate neighbourhood of York, are there so many places\r\nwhere the value has risen. Yet the greater part of it was let out to\r\nunder-tenants.\r\n\r\nROCHESTER, Kent (Fig. 28).--Under the heading of Aylsford, Kent, the\r\nSurvey tells us that \"the bishop of Rochester holds as much of this\r\nland as is worth 17s. 4d. _in exchange for the land in which the castle\r\nsits_.\"[610] Rochester was a Roman _castrum_, and portions of its Roman\r\nwall have recently been found.[611] The fact that various old charters\r\nspeak of the _castellum_ of Rochester has led some authorities to\r\nbelieve that there was a castle there in Saxon times, but the context\r\nof these charters shows plainly that the words _castellum Roffense_\r\nwere equivalent to _Castrum Roffense_ or _Hrofesceastre_.[612]\r\nOtherwise there is not a particle of evidence for the existence of a\r\ncastle at Rochester in pre-Norman times, and the passage in Domesday\r\nquoted above shows that William's castle was a new erection, built on\r\nland obtained by exchange from the church.\r\n\r\nOutside the line of the Roman wall, to the south of the city, and west\r\nof the south gate, there is a district called Boley or Bullie Hill,\r\nwhich at one time was included in the fortifications of the present\r\ncastle. It is a continuation of the ridge on which that castle stands,\r\nand has been separated from it by a ditch. This ditch once entirely\r\nsurrounded it, and though it was partly filled up in the 18th century\r\nits line can still be traced. The area enclosed by this ditch was\r\nabout 3 acres; the form appears to have been oblong. In the grounds\r\nof Satis House, one of the villas which have been built on this site,\r\nthere still remains a conical artificial mound, much reduced in size,\r\nas it has been converted into a pleasure-ground with winding walks,\r\nbut the retaining walls of these walks are composed of old materials;\r\nand towards the riverside there are still vestiges of an ancient\r\nwall.[613] We venture to think that this Boley Hill and its motte\r\nformed the original site of the (probably) wooden castle of William\r\nthe Conqueror. Its nature, position, and size correspond to what we\r\nhave already observed as characteristic of the first castles of the\r\nConquest. It stands on land which originally belonged to the church of\r\nSt Andrew, as Domesday Book tells us William's castle did.[614] The\r\nvery name may be interpreted in favour of this theory.[615] And that\r\nthere was no Roman or Saxon fortification on the spot is proved by\r\nexcavations, which have shown that both a Roman and a Saxon cemetery\r\noccupied portions of the area.[616]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that between the years 1087 and 1089 the celebrated\r\narchitect, Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, built a new _stone_ castle\r\nfor William Rufus, \"in the best part of the city of Rochester.\"[617]\r\nThis castle, of course, was on the same site as the present one,\r\nthough the splendid keep was not built till the next reign.[618] But\r\nif what we have maintained above be correct the castle of Gundulf was\r\nbuilt on a different site from that of the castle of William. Nor are\r\nwe without evidence in support of this. What remains of the original\r\nNorman wall of Gundulf's castle (and enough remains to show that the\r\ncircuit was complete in Norman times) does not stand on earthen banks;\r\nand this, though not a proof, is a strong suggestion that there was\r\nno earthen bank belonging to some previous castle when Gundulf began\r\nhis building.[619] But further, Mr Livett has shown in his paper on\r\n_Mediæval Rochester_[620] that in order to form a level plateau for\r\nthe court of the castle the ground had to be artificially made up on\r\nthe north and east sides, and in these places the wall rests on a\r\nfoundation of gravel, which has been forcibly rammed to make it solid,\r\nand which goes through the artificial soil to the natural chalk below.\r\nNow what can this rammed gravel mean but an expedient to avoid the\r\ndanger of building in stone on freshly heaped soil? Had the artificial\r\nplatform been in existence ever since the Conquest, it would have been\r\nsolid enough to build upon without this expense. It is therefore at\r\nleast probable that Bishop Gundulf's castle was built on an entirely\r\nnew site.\r\n\r\nIt seems also to be clear that the Boley Hill was included as an\r\noutwork in Bishop Gundulf's plan, for the castle ditch is cut through\r\nthe Roman wall near the south gate of the city.[621] Mr Livett remarks\r\nthat King John appears to have used the hill as a point of vantage\r\nwhen he attacked the city in 1215, and he thinks this was probably the\r\nreason why Henry III.'s engineers enclosed it with a stone wall when\r\nthey restored the walls of the city.[622] Henry III.'s wall has been\r\ntraced all round the city, and at the second south gate it turns at\r\nright angles, or nearly so, so as to enclose Boley Hill.[623] It is\r\nprobable, as Mr Livett suggests, that the drawbridge and _bretasche_,\r\nor wooden tower, ordered in 1226 for the southern side of Rochester\r\nCastle,[624] were intended to connect the Boley Hill court with the\r\nmain castle. In 1722 the owner of the castle (which had then fallen\r\ninto private hands) conveyed to one Philip Brooke, \"that part of the\r\ncastle ditch and ground, as it then lay unenclosed, on Bully Hill,\r\nbeing the whole breadth of the hill and ditch without the walls of the\r\ncastle, extending from thence to the river Medway.\"[625]\r\n\r\nThe general opinion about the Boley Hill is that it is a Danish\r\nearthwork, thrown up by the Danes when they besieged the city in 885.\r\nBut if our contention in Chapter IV. is just, the Danish fortifications\r\nwere not mottes, nor anything like them; and (as has already been\r\npointed out) the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ indicates the nature of the\r\nfortress in this case by its expression, \"they made a work around\r\nthemselves\";[626] that is, it was a circumvallation. Moreover, at\r\nRochester the Danes would have had to pass under the bridge (which is\r\nknown to have existed both in Roman and Saxon times) in order to get to\r\nthe Boley Hill; and even if their ships were small enough to do this\r\nthey would hardly have been so foolish as to leave a bridge in their\r\npossible line of retreat. It is therefore far more likely that their\r\nfastness was somewhere to the north or east of the city.[627]\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that up till very recently the Boley Hill had\r\na special jurisdiction of its own, under an officer called the Baron\r\nof the Bully, appointed by the Recorder of the city. This appears to\r\ndate from a charter of Edward IV. in 1460, which confirms the former\r\nliberties of the citizens of Rochester, and ordains that they should\r\nkeep two courts' leet and a court of pie-powder annually on the Bullie\r\nHill. The anonymous historian of Rochester remarks that it was thought\r\nthat the baron represented the first officer under the governor of the\r\ncastle before the court leet was instituted, to whose care the security\r\nof the Bullie Hill was entrusted.[628] This is probably much nearer the\r\ntruth than the theory which would assign such thoroughly feudal courts\r\nas those of court leet and pie-powder to an imaginary community of\r\nDanes residing on the Boley Hill. When we compare the case of the Boley\r\nHill with the somewhat similar cases of Chester and Norwich castles\r\nwe shall see that what took place in Edward IV.'s reign was probably\r\nthis: the separate jurisdiction which had once belonged to an abandoned\r\ncastle site was transferred to the citizens of Rochester, but with the\r\nusual conservatism of mediæval legislation, it was not absorbed in the\r\njurisdiction of the city.\r\n\r\nThe value of Rochester at the time of the Survey had risen from 100_s._\r\nto 20_l._[629] The increase of trade, arising from the security of\r\ntraffic which was provided by William's castles on this important\r\nroute, no doubt accounts in great measure for this remarkable rise in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nROCKINGHAM, Northants (Fig. 29).--Here, also, the castle was clearly\r\nnew in William's reign, as the manor was uninhabited (_wasta_) until a\r\ncastle was built there by his orders, in consequence of which the manor\r\nproduced a small revenue at the time of the Survey.[630] The motte,\r\nnow in great part destroyed, was a large one, being about 80 feet\r\nin diameter at the top; attached to it is a bailey of irregular but\r\nrectilateral shape (determined by the ground) covering about 3 acres.\r\nThere is another large bailey to the S. covering 4 acres, formed by\r\ncutting a ditch across the spur of the hill on which the castle stands,\r\nwhich is probably later. The first castle would undoubtedly be of wood,\r\nand it is probable that King John was the builder of the \"exceeding\r\nfair and strong\" keep which stood on the motte in Leland's time,[631]\r\nas there is an entry in the _Pipe Roll_ of the thirteenth year of his\r\nreign for 126_l._ 18_s._ 6_d._ for the work of the new tower.[632] This\r\nkeep, if Mr Clark is correct, was polygonal, with a timber stockade\r\nsurrounding it.\r\n\r\nRockingham was only a small manor of one hide in Saxon times, though\r\nits Saxon owner had sac and soke. It stands in a forest district, not\r\nnear any of the great ancient lines of road, and was probably built for\r\na hunting seat.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor had risen at the time of the Survey.[633]\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War, the motte of Rockingham was fortified in an\r\nelaborate manner by the Parliamentarians, part of the defences being\r\ntwo wooden stockades:[634] an interesting instance of the use both of\r\nmottes and of wooden fortifications in comparatively modern warfare.\r\nOnly the north and west sides of this mount now remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. Rockingham, Northants.]\r\n\r\nOLD SARUM, Wilts (Fig. 30).--Sir Richard Colt Hoare printed in his\r\n_Ancient Wiltshire_ a document purporting to be an order from Alfred,\r\n\"King of the English,\" to Leofric, \"Earl of Wiltunshire,\" to maintain\r\nthe castle of Sarum, and add another ditch to it.[635] The phraseology\r\nof the document suggests some doubts of its genuineness, and though\r\nthere would be nothing improbable in the theory that Alfred reared\r\nthe outer bank of the fortress, recent excavations have shown that\r\nthe place was occupied by the Romans, and therefore make it certain\r\nthat its origin was very much earlier than Alfred's time. Moreover,\r\nthe convergence of several Roman roads at this spot suggests the\r\nprobability of a Roman station,[636] while the form of the enclosure\r\nrenders an earlier origin likely. Domesday Book does not speak of\r\nSalisbury as a _burgus_, and when the _burgus_ of Old Sarum is\r\nmentioned in later documents it appears to refer to a district lying at\r\nthe foot of the Castle Hill, and formerly enclosed with a wall.[637]\r\nNor is it one of the boroughs of the _Burghal Hidage_. But that Sarum\r\nwas an important place in Saxon times is clear from the fact that there\r\nwas a mint there; and there is evidence of the existence of at least\r\nfour Saxon churches, as well as a hospital for lepers.[638]\r\n\r\nFor more exact knowledge as to the history of this ancient fortress\r\nwe must wait till the excavations now going on are finished, but in\r\nthe meanwhile it seems probable that the theory adopted by General\r\nPitt-Rivers is correct. He regarded Old Sarum as a British earthwork,\r\nwith an inner castle and outer barbicans added by the Normans. After\r\nbuilding this castle in the midst of it the Normans appear to have\r\nconsidered the outer and larger fortification too valuable to be\r\ngiven up to the public, but retained it under the government of the\r\ncastellan, and treated it as part of the castle.\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of the castle of Salisbury in Domesday Book, but\r\nthe bishop is named as the owner of the manor.[639] The episcopal see\r\nof Sherborne was transferred to Sarum in 1076 by Bishop Hermann, in\r\naccordance with the policy adopted by William I. that episcopal sees\r\nshould be removed from villages to towns:[640] a measure which in\r\nitself is a testimony to the importance of Salisbury at that time.\r\nThe first mention of the castle is in the charter of Bishop Osmund,\r\n1091.[641] The bishop was allowed to lay the foundations of his new\r\ncathedral within the ancient fortress. As might be expected, friction\r\nsoon arose between the castellans and the ecclesiastics; the castellans\r\nclaimed the custody of the gates, and sometimes barred the canons,\r\nwhose houses seem to have been outside the fortress, from access to\r\nthe church. These quarrels were ended eventually by the removal of the\r\ncathedral to the new town of Salisbury at the foot of the hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. Old Sarum, Wilts.]\r\n\r\nThe position of the motte of Old Sarum is exceptional, as it stands in\r\nthe centre of the outer fortress. This must be owing to the position\r\nof the ancient vallum, encircling the summit of one of those round,\r\ngradually sloping hills so common in the chalk ranges, which made it\r\nnecessary to place the motte in the centre, because it was the highest\r\npart of the ground. The present excavations have shown that it is in\r\npart artificial. But though the citadel was thus exceptionally placed,\r\nthe principle that communication with the outside must be maintained\r\nwas carried out; the motte had its own bailey, reaching to the outer\r\nvallum. The remains of three cross banks still exist, two of which must\r\nhave enclosed the _magnum ballium_ which is spoken of in the _Pipe\r\nRolls_ of Henry II. Probably this bailey occupied the south-eastern\r\nthird of the circle, which included the main gateway and the road to\r\nthe citadel. In the ditch on the north side of this enclosure, an\r\narched passage, apparently of Norman construction, was found in 1795;\r\nit was doubtless a postern or sallyport.[642] The main entrance is\r\ndefended by a separate mount with its own ditch, which is conjectured\r\nto be of later date than the vallum itself. The area of the top of the\r\nmotte is about 1-3/4 acres, a larger size than usual, but not larger\r\nthan that of several other important castles.[643] In Leland's time\r\nthere was \"much notable ruinous building\" still remaining of this\r\nfortress, and the excavations have already revealed the lower portions\r\nof some splendid walls and gateways, and the basement of a late Norman\r\nkeep which presents some unusual features.[644] The earthworks,\r\nhowever, bear witness to a former wooden stockade both to the citadel\r\nand the outer enclosure. The top of the motte is still surrounded by\r\nhigh earthen banks.\r\n\r\nAs that great building bishop, Roger of Salisbury (1099-1139), is\r\nsaid to have environed the castle with a new wall,[645] it would\r\nseem likely that he was the first to transform the castle from wood\r\nto stone. But in Henry II.'s reign, we find an entry in the _Pipe\r\nRolls_ for materials for enclosing the great bailey. An order for the\r\ndestruction of the castle had been issued by Stephen,[646] but it is\r\ndoubtful whether it was carried out. The sums spent by Henry II. on the\r\ncastle do not amount to more than £266, 12s. 5d., but the work recently\r\nexcavated which appears to be of his date is very extensive indeed.\r\n\r\nThe mention of a small wooden tower in Richard I.'s reign shows that\r\nsome parts of the defences were still of wood at that date.[647]\r\nTimber and rods for _hoarding_ the castle, that is, for the wooden\r\nmachicolations placed at the tops of towers and walls, were ordered at\r\nthe end of John's reign.[648]\r\n\r\nIt is not known when the castle was abandoned, but the list of\r\ncastellans ceases in the reign of Henry VI., when it was granted to\r\nthe Stourton family.[649] Though the earls of Salisbury were generally\r\nthe custodians of Sarum Castle, except in the time of Bishop Roger, it\r\nwas always considered a royal castle, while the manor belonged to the\r\nbishop.[650] It is remarked in the _Hundred Rolls_ of Henry III., that\r\nno one holds fiefs for ward in this castle, and that nothing belonged\r\nto the castle outside the gate.[651]\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Salisbury appears to have risen very greatly\r\nsince the Conquest.[652]\r\n\r\nSHREWSBURY (Fig. 31).--The passage in Domesday Book relating to this\r\ntown has been called by Mr Round one of the most important in the\r\nSurvey, and it is of special importance for our present purpose. \"The\r\nEnglish burghers of Shrewsbury say that it is very grievous to them\r\nthat they have to pay all the geld which they paid in King Edward's\r\ntime, although the castle of the earl occupies [the site of] 51 houses,\r\nand another 50 are uninhabited.\"[653] It is incomprehensible how in the\r\nface of such a clear statement as this, that the new castle occupied\r\nthe site of fifty-one houses, anyone should be found gravely to\r\nmaintain that the motte at Shrewsbury was an English work; for if the\r\nmotte stood there before, what was the clearance of houses made for?\r\nThe only answer could be to enlarge the bailey. But this is exactly\r\nwhat the Norman would not wish to do; he would want only a small\r\narea for the small force at his disposal for defence. Shrewsbury was\r\ncertainly a borough (that is, a fortified town) in Anglo-Saxon times;\r\nprobably it was one of the towns fortified by Ethelfleda, though it\r\nis not mentioned by name in the list of those towns furnished by the\r\n_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_.[654] Its ancient walls were certainly only\r\nof earth and wood, for a writ of 1231 says that the old stockade and\r\nthe old bretasche of the old ditch of the town of Shrewsbury are to be\r\ngranted to the burghers for strengthening the new ditch.[655]\r\n\r\nThe castle of Shrewsbury was built on the neck of the peninsula on\r\nwhich the town stands, and on the line of the town walls. The oval\r\nmotte, which still remains, stands, as usual, on the line of the castle\r\nbanks, and slopes steeply down to the Severn on one side. Its nearness\r\nto the river made it liable to damage by floods. Thus we find Henry\r\nII. spending 5_l._ on the repair of the motte,[656] and in Edward I.'s\r\nreign the abbot's mill is accused of having caused damage to the extent\r\nof 60 marks to the motte. But the men of the hundred exonerate the\r\nmill, and from another passage the blame appears to lie on the fall of\r\na great wooden tower.[657] This can hardly have been other than the\r\nwooden keep on the motte, and thus we learn the interesting fact that\r\nas late as Edward I.'s reign the castle of Shrewsbury had only a\r\nwooden keep. The present tower on the motte is the work of Telford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. Shrewsbury. Skipsea, Yorks.]\r\n\r\nThe bailey of Shrewsbury Castle is roughly semilunar and covers nearly\r\nan acre. The walls stand on banks, which shows that the first wall was\r\nof timber. The Norman entrance arch seems to render it probable that it\r\nwas in Henry II.'s reign that stone walls were first substituted for a\r\nwooden stockade, and the _Pipe Rolls_ contain several entries of sums\r\nspent by Henry on this castle.[658] But the first mention of stone in\r\nconnection with the castle is in the reign of Henry III.[659] In the\r\nreign of Edward I., a _jarola_ or wooden wall, which had been raised\r\nabove the outer ditch in the time of the Barons' War, was replaced\r\nby a stone wall.[660] This perhaps refers to the second bailey, now\r\ndestroyed, which lay to the south of the castle. In the time of Charles\r\nI. the castle still had a wooden palisade on the counterscarp of the\r\nditch.[661] The two large drum towers on the walls, and the building\r\nbetween them, now converted into a modern house, belong to a much later\r\nperiod than the walls. The area of the present castle, including the\r\nmotte, is 4/5 of an acre.\r\n\r\nThe value of the town of Shrewsbury had risen since the Conquest.\r\n\r\nSKIPSEA, Yorks (Fig. 31).--There is no mention of this castle in\r\nDomesday Book, but the chronicle of Meaux Abbey tells us that it\r\nwas built by Drogo de Bevrère in the reign of William I.[662] This\r\nchronicle is not indeed contemporary, but its most recent editor\r\nregards it as based on some much earlier document. It was the key of\r\nthe great manor of Holderness, which the Conqueror had given to Drogo,\r\nbut which Drogo forfeited by murdering his wife, probably on this very\r\nsite. The situation of Skipsea is remarkable, but the original plan of\r\nKenilworth Castle presented a close parallel to it. The motte, which\r\nis 46 feet high, and 1/5 of an acre in space on top, is separated from\r\nthe bailey by a level space, which was formerly the Mere of Skipsea,\r\nmentioned in documents of the 13th century, which reckon the take of\r\neels in this mere as a source of revenue.[663] The motte thus formed\r\nan island in the mere, but as an additional defence--perhaps when the\r\nmere began to get shallow--it was surrounded by a bank and ditch of its\r\nown. No masonry is to be seen on the motte now, except a portion of a\r\nwing wall going down it. It is connected with its bailey on the other\r\nside of the mere by a causeway which still exists. This bailey is of\r\nvery unusual size, covering 8-1/4 acres; its banks still retain the\r\nname of the Baile Welts, and one of the entrances is called the Baile\r\nGate. Skipsea Brough, which no doubt represents the former _burgus_\r\nof Skipsea, is outside this enclosure, and has no defences of its\r\nown remaining. A mandate of Henry III. in 1221, ordered the complete\r\ndestruction of this castle,[664] and it was no doubt after this that\r\nthe earls of Albemarle, who had succeeded to Drogo's estates, removed\r\ntheir _caput baroniæ_ to Burstwick.[665]\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Cleeton, in which Skipsea lies, had fallen at\r\nDomesday.[666]\r\n\r\nSTAFFORD (Fig. 32).--The _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ says that Ethelfleda\r\nof Mercia built the _burh_ of Stafford; and consequently we find that\r\nboth in King Edward and King William's time Stafford was a burgus,\r\nor fortified town. Florence of Worcester, who is considered to have\r\nused a superior copy of the _Chronicle_ as the foundation of his work,\r\nsays that Ethelfleda built an _arx_ on the north bank of the Sowe\r\nin 914. _Arx_, in our earlier chronicles, is often only a bombastic\r\nexpression for a walled town, as, for example, when Ethelwerd says\r\nthat Ethelfleda's body was buried in St Peter's porch in the _arx_\r\nof Gloucester.[667] But the statement led many later writers, such\r\nas Camden, to imagine that Ethelfleda built a _tower_ in the town of\r\nStafford; and these imaginings have created such a tangled skein of\r\nmistake that we must bespeak our readers' patience while we attempt to\r\nunravel it.\r\n\r\nDomesday Book only mentions Stafford Castle under the manor of Chebsey,\r\na possession of Henry de Ferrers. Its words are: \"To this manor\r\n_belonged_ the land of Stafford, in which the king commanded a castle\r\nto be built, which is now destroyed.\"[668] Ordericus also says that the\r\nking placed a castle at Stafford, on his return from his third visit to\r\nthe north, in 1070.[669] Now the language of Domesday appears to us to\r\nsay very plainly that in the manorial rearrangement which followed the\r\nConquest some land was taken out of the manor of Chebsey, which lies\r\nimmediately to the south of the borough of Stafford, to furnish a site\r\nfor a royal castle.[670] It is exactly in this position that we now\r\nfind a large oblong motte, similar to the other mottes of the Conquest,\r\nand having the usual bailey attached to it. It lies about a mile and a\r\nhalf south-west of the town, near the main road leading into Shropshire.\r\n\r\nThe position was an important one, as the castles of Staffordshire\r\nformed a second line of defence against the North Welsh, as well as\r\na check to the great palatinate earls of Shropshire.[671] The motte\r\nitself stood on high ground, commanding a view of twenty or thirty\r\nmiles round, and both Tutbury and Caus castles could be seen from\r\nit. Between it and the town lies a stretch of flat ground which has\r\nevidently been a swamp formerly, and which explains the distance of the\r\ncastle from the town; while the fact that it lies to the _south_ of the\r\nSowe shows that it has no connection with Ethelfleda's work. There is\r\nno dispute that this motte was the site of the later baronial castle of\r\nStafford, the castle besieged and taken in the Civil War; the point we\r\nhave to prove is that it was also the castle of Domesday Book.[672]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. Stafford. Stanton Holgate, Salop. Tamworth,\r\nStaffs. Tickhill, Yorks.]\r\n\r\nIf the first castle of Stafford was of earth and wood, like most of\r\nWilliam's castles, there would be nothing wonderful in its having\r\nmany destructions and many resurrections. This castle was clearly a\r\nroyal castle, from the language of Domesday Book. As a royal castle\r\nit would be committed to the custody of the sheriff, who appears to\r\nhave been Robert de Stafford,[673] ancestor of the later barons of\r\nStafford, and brother of Ralph de Todeni, one of the great nobles\r\nof the Conquest. Ralph joined the party of Robert Curthose against\r\nHenry I. in 1101, and it is conjectured that his brother Robert was\r\ninvolved in the same rebellion, for in that year we find the castle\r\nheld for the king by William Pantolf, a trusty companion of the\r\nConqueror.[674] It is very unlikely that this second castle of Stafford\r\nwas on a different site from the one which had been destroyed; and an\r\ningenious conjecture of Mr Mazzinghi's helps us to identify it with\r\nthe castle on the motte. In that castle, when it again emerges into\r\nlight in the reign of Henry II., we find a chapel dedicated to St\r\nNicholas, which Robert de Stafford gives to the abbey of Stone, and the\r\nking confirms the gift.[675] The worship of St Nicholas came greatly\r\ninto fashion after the translation of his remains from Asia Minor to\r\nBari, in Italy, in 1087. William Pantolf visited the shrine at Bari,\r\ngot possession of some of the relics of St Nicholas, and with great\r\nreverence deposited them in his own church of Noron, in Normandy.[676]\r\nIt is therefore extremely probable that Pantolf founded the chapel\r\nof St Nicholas in Stafford Castle during the time that the castle\r\nwas in his custody.[677] But about the situation of the chapel of St\r\nNicholas there is no doubt, as its history is traceable down to the\r\n16th century. It stood in the bailey of the castle outside the town.\r\nThis castle was therefore certainly identical with that of Henry II.,\r\nand most probably with that of Henry I. and William I.\r\n\r\nSo far, as we have seen, Stafford Castle was a royal castle. It is true\r\nthat in the reign of Henry II.'s predecessor, Stephen, we find the\r\ncastle again in the hands of a Robert de Stafford, who speaks of it\r\nas \"castellum meum.\"[678] Apparently the troubles of Stephen's reign\r\nafforded an opportunity to the family of the first Norman sheriff to\r\nget the castle again into their hands. But under the stronger rule\r\nof Henry II. the crown recovered its rights, and the gift of the\r\nchapel in the castle evidently could not be made without the consent\r\nof the king. The gaol which Henry II. caused to be made in Stafford\r\nwas doubtless in this castle.[679] John repaired the castle,[680]\r\nand ordered _bretasches_, or wooden towers, to be made in the forest\r\nof Arundel, and sent to Stafford:[681] a statement which gives us an\r\ninsight into the nature of the castle in John's reign. But it was\r\nthe tendency of sheriffdoms to become hereditary, as Dr Stubbs has\r\npointed out,[682] and this seems to have been the case at Stafford. In\r\nthe reign of Edward I. a local jury decided that Nicholas, Baron of\r\nStafford, held the castle of Stafford from the king _in capite_, by the\r\nservice of three and a half knights' fees;[683] and in 1348, Ralph,\r\nBaron of Stafford, obtained a license from Edward III. \"to fortify and\r\ncrenellate his _manses_ of Stafford and Madlee with a wall of stone and\r\nlime, and to make castles thereof.\"[684] The indenture made with the\r\nmason a year previously is still extant, and states that the castle\r\nis to be built upon the _moële_ in the manor, whereby the motte is\r\nevidently meant.[685] Besides, the deed is dated \"at the Chastel of\r\nStafford,\" showing that the new castle of stone and lime was on the\r\nsite of an already existing castle.\r\n\r\nWe might spin out further evidence of the identity of the site of\r\nWilliam's castle with that of the present one, from the name of the\r\nmanor of Castel, which grew up around it, displacing the equally\r\nsuggestive name of Montville, which we find in Domesday Book.[686]\r\nAgainst the existence of another castle in the town we have the absence\r\nof any such castle in William Smith's plan of 1588; the silence of\r\nSpeed and Leland, who only mention the present castle;[687] and the\r\nstatement of Plot, who wrote about the end of the 17th century,\r\nthat \"he could not hear any footsteps remaining\" of a castle in\r\nStafford.[688] We may therefore safely conclude that it was only due to\r\nthe fancy of some Elizabethan antiquary that in an old map of that time\r\na spot to the south-west of the town is marked with the inscription,\r\n\"The old castle, built by Edward the Elder, and in memorie fortified\r\nwith reel walls.\"[689]\r\n\r\nThe value of Stafford town had risen at the time of the Survey, as the\r\nking had 7_l._ for his share, which would make the whole revenue to\r\nking and earl 10_l._ 10_s._, as against 9_l._ before the Conquest. The\r\nproperty of the canons of Stafford had risen from £1 to £3.[690]\r\n\r\nThe area of the bailey is 1-3/5 acres.\r\n\r\nSTAMFORD, Lincoln and Northants.--This was one of the boroughs\r\nfortified by Edward the Elder, and consequently we find it a royal\r\n_burgus_ at the time of the Survey. But Edward's borough, the\r\n_Chronicle_ tells us, was on the south side of the Welland; the\r\nnorthern borough, on the other side, may have been the work of the\r\nDanes, as Stamford was one of the towns of the Danish confederacy of\r\nthe Five Boroughs. The Norman castle and its motte are on the north\r\nside, and five _mansiones_ were destroyed for the site.[691] There is\r\nat present no appearance of masonry on the motte, which is partly cut\r\naway, and what remains of the castle wall is of the 13th century. It\r\nis therefore probable that the _turris_, or keep, which surrendered to\r\nHenry II. in 1153, was of wood.[692] Henry gave the castle to Richard\r\nHumet, constable of Normandy, in 1155.[693] It was a very exceptional\r\nthing that Henry should thus alienate a royal castle, and special\r\ncircumstances must have moved him to this act. The castle was destroyed\r\nin Richard III.'s time, and the materials given to the convent of the\r\nCarmelite Friars. It appears to have been within the town walls, with\r\na bailey stretching down to the river; this bailey is quadrangular.\r\nAn inquisition of 1341 states that \"the site of the castle contains 2\r\nacres.\"[694]\r\n\r\nStamford had risen enormously in value since the Conquest. \"In King\r\nEdward's time it paid 15_l._; now, it pays for _feorm_ 50_l._, and for\r\nthe whole of the king's dues it now pays 28_l._\"[695]\r\n\r\nSTANTON, Stanton Long, in Shropshire (Fig. 32).--At the time of the\r\nSurvey, the Norman Helgot was Lord of Corve Dale, and had his castle\r\nat Stanton.[696] The castle was afterwards known as Helgot's Castle,\r\ncorrupted into Castle Holdgate. The site has been much altered by the\r\nbuilding of a farmhouse in the bailey, but the motte still exists,\r\nhigh and steep, with a ditch round about half its circumference;\r\nthere are some traces of masonry on the top. One side of the bailey\r\nditch is still visible, and a mural tower of Edwardian style has\r\nbeen incorporated with the farmhouse. The exact area cannot now be\r\ncalculated, but it can hardly have exceeded 2-1/2 acres. The manor of\r\nStanton was an agglomeration of four small manors which had been held\r\nby different proprietors in Saxon times, so it was not the centre of a\r\nsoke. The value of the manor had risen.\r\n\r\nTAMWORTH, Stafford (Fig. 32).--Although Tamworth Castle is not\r\nmentioned in Domesday Book, it must have been in existence in the\r\n11th century, as a charter of the Empress Matilda mentions that\r\nRobert le Despenser, brother of Urso d'Abetot, had formerly held this\r\ncastle;[697] now Urso d'Abetot was a contemporary of the Conqueror,\r\nand so must his brother have been. Tamworth Castle stands on a motte\r\n50 feet high, and 100 feet in diameter across the top, according to\r\nMr Clark. It is an interesting instance of what is commonly called a\r\nshell keep, with a stone tower; one of the instances which suggest that\r\nthe shell did not belong to a different type of castle to the tower,\r\nbut was simply a ward wall, which probably at first enclosed a wooden\r\ntower. The tower and wall (or chemise) are probably late Norman, but\r\nthe remarkable wing wall (there is only one, instead of the usual two)\r\nwhich runs down the motte is entirely of herring-bone work, and _may_\r\nbe as old as Henry I.'s time.[698] A bailey court, which cannot have\r\nbeen large, lay between the motte and the river Tame, but its outline\r\ncannot now be determined, owing to the encroachments of buildings.\r\nTamworth is about a mile from the great Roman road known as Watling\r\nStreet. We have already referred to the fortification of the _burh_\r\nhere by Ethelfleda;[699] probably she only restored walls or banks\r\nwhich had existed before round this ancient capital of Mercia.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Tamworth is not given in Domesday Book.\r\n\r\nTICKHILL, Yorks (Fig. 32).--The name Tickhill does not occur in\r\nDomesday, but it is covered by that of Dadesley, the manor in which\r\nthis castle was built: a name which appears to have gone out of use\r\nwhen the _hill_ was thrown up. There can be no doubt that it was the\r\ncastle of Roger de Busli, one of the most richly endowed of William's\r\ntenants-in-chief, as it is mentioned as such by Ordericus.[700] He\r\ncalls it the castle of Blythe, a name which it probably received\r\nbecause Blythe was the most important place near, and Dadesley was so\r\ninsignificant. Florence of Worcester, when describing the same events,\r\ncalls the castle Tykehill. The remains furnish an excellent specimen of\r\nthe earthworks of this class. The motte is 75 feet high, and its area\r\non top about 80 feet in diameter; about a third of it is natural, the\r\nrest artificial. Only a slight trace remains of the ditch separating\r\nit from the oval bailey, which covers 2 acres. The foundations of a\r\ndecagonal tower, built in the reign of Henry II., are still to be seen\r\non the top.[701] The bailey retains its banks on the scarp, surmounted\r\nnow by a stone curtain, which, along with the older part of the\r\ngatehouse, is possibly of the time of Henry I.[702] The outer ditch\r\nis about 30 feet broad, and is still full of water in parts. On the\r\ncounterscarp a portion of the bank remains. This bank carried a wooden\r\npalisade when the castle was besieged by Cromwell.[703] The site is\r\nnot naturally defensible; it is about three and a half miles from the\r\nnorthern Roman road.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Dadesley had risen at the time of the\r\nSurvey.[704] The stone buildings which once stood in the bailey have\r\nbeen transformed into a modern house.\r\n\r\nTONBRIDGE, Kent (Fig. 33).--This notable castle, the first English\r\nseat of the powerful family who afterwards took their name from Clare\r\nin Suffolk, is first mentioned in 1088, when it was stormed by William\r\nRufus and his English subjects, who had adopted his cause against the\r\nsupporters of his brother Robert.[705] The castle was one of great\r\nimportance at several crises in English history; but it began as a\r\nwooden keep on a motte, and the stone shell which now crowns this motte\r\ncannot be earlier than the 12th century, and judging by its buttresses,\r\nis much later. The castle stands outside the town of Tonbridge,\r\nseparated from it by moats which were fed from the river. The smaller\r\nbailey of 1-1/2 acres, probably the original one, is square, with\r\nrounded corners. The palatial gatehouse, of the 13th or 14th century,\r\nis a marked feature of this castle. There appears to have been only\r\none wing wall down the motte to the bailey, but a second one was not\r\nneeded, owing to the position of the motte with regard to the river.\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Hadlow, in which Tonbridge lay, was\r\nstationary at Domesday.[706] It belonged to the see of Canterbury, and\r\nwas held by Richard de Bienfaite, ancestor of the House of Clare, as\r\na tenant of the see.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. Tonbridge, Kent. Totnes, Devon.]\r\n\r\nTOTNES, Devonshire (Fig. 33).--The castle of Totnes belonged to\r\nJudhael, one of King William's men, who has been already mentioned\r\nunder Barnstaple. This castle is not noticed in Domesday Book, but\r\nits existence in the 11th century is made certain by a charter of\r\nJudhael's giving land _below his castle_ to the Benedictine priory\r\nwhich he had founded at Totnes: a charter certainly of the Conqueror's\r\nreign, as it contains a prayer for the health of King William.[707]\r\nThe site was an important one; Totnes had been one of the boroughs of\r\nthe _Burghal Hidage_; it was at the head of a navigable river, and was\r\nthe point where the ancient Roman (?) road from Devonshire to Bath and\r\nthe North began its course.[708] The motte of the castle is very high\r\nand precipitous, and has a shell on top, which is perfect up to the\r\nbattlements, and appears to be rather late Norman. This keep is entered\r\nin a very unusual way, by a flight of steps leading up from the bailey,\r\ndeeply sunk in the upper part into the face of the motte, so as to\r\nform a highly defensible passage. Two wing walls run down to the walls\r\nof the bailey. There is at present no ditch between the motte and the\r\nbailey. The whole area of the work is 3/4 acre. It stands in a very\r\ndefensible situation on a spur of hill overlooking the town, and lies\r\njust outside the ancient walls.\r\n\r\nThe value of the town of Totnes had risen at Domesday.[709]\r\n\r\nTHE TOWER OF LONDON.--Here, as at Colchester, there is no motte,\r\nbecause the original design was that there should be a stone\r\nkeep. Ordericus tells us that after the submission of London to\r\nWilliam the Conqueror he stayed for a few days in Barking while\r\ncertain fortifications in the city were being finished, to curb the\r\nexcitability of the huge and fierce population.[710] What these\r\nfortifications were we shall never know, but we may imagine they were\r\nearthworks of the usual Norman kind.[711] Certainly the great keep\r\nfamiliarly known as the White Tower was not built in a few days;\r\nit does not appear to have been even begun till some eleven years\r\nlater, when Gundulf, a monk celebrated for his architectural skill,\r\nwas appointed to the see of Rochester. Gundulf was the architect of\r\nthe Tower,[712] and it must therefore have been built during his\r\nepiscopate, which lasted from 1077-1108.[713] In 1097 we read that\r\n\"many shires which owe works to London were greatly oppressed in making\r\nthe wall (weall) round the Tower.\"[714] This does not necessarily mean\r\na stone wall, but probably it does, as Gundulf's tower can hardly have\r\nbeen without a bank and palisade to its bailey.\r\n\r\nAs the Tower in its general plan represents the type of keep which was\r\nthe model for all succeeding stone keeps up to the end of the 12th\r\ncentury, it seems appropriate here to give some description of its\r\nmain features. Its resemblance to the keep of Colchester, which also\r\nwas a work of William I.'s reign, is very striking.[715] Colchester is\r\nthe larger of the two, but the Tower exceeds in size all other English\r\nkeeps, measuring 118 × 98 feet at its base.[716] As it has been altered\r\nor added to in every century, its details are peculiarly difficult to\r\ntrace, especially as the ordinary visitor is not allowed to make a\r\nthorough examination.[717] Thus much, however, is certain: neither of\r\nthe two present entrances on the ground floor is original; the first\r\nentrance was on the first floor, some 25 feet above the ground, at the\r\nS.W. angle of the south side, and has been transformed into a window.\r\nThere was no entrance to the basement, but it was only reached by\r\nthe grand staircase, which is enclosed in a round turret at the N.E.\r\nangle. There were two other stairs at the N.W. and S.W. angles, but\r\nthese only began on the first floor. The basement is divided by a cross\r\nwall, which is carried up to the third storey. There are at present\r\nthree storeys above the basement. The basement, which is now vaulted\r\nin brick, was not originally vaulted at all, except the south-eastern\r\nchamber, under the crypt of the chapel.\r\n\r\nThe first floor, like the basement, is divided into three rooms, as,\r\nin addition to the usual cross wall, the Tower has a branch cross wall\r\nto its eastern section, which is carried up to the top. This floor\r\nwas formerly only lit by loopholes; Clark states that there were two\r\nfireplaces in the east wall, but there is some doubt about this. The\r\nS.E. room contained the crypt of the chapel, which was vaulted. It\r\nis commonly supposed that the rooms on the first floor were occupied\r\nby the guards of the keep. In the account which we have quoted from\r\nLambert of Ardres, the first floor is said to be the lord's habitation,\r\nand the upper storey that of the guards; so that there seems to have\r\nbeen no invariable rule.[718] No special room was allotted to the\r\nkitchen, as in time of peace at any rate, the lord of the castle and\r\nall his retainers took their meals in a great hall in the bailey of the\r\ncastle.[719] The ceilings of the two larger rooms of this floor are now\r\nsupported by posts, an arrangement which is probably modern, as the\r\npresent posts certainly are.[720]\r\n\r\nThe second floor contains the chapel, which in many keeps is merely\r\nan oratory, but is here of unusual size. Its eastern end is carried\r\nout in a round apse, a feature which is also found at Colchester, but\r\nis not usual in Norman keeps.[721] It is a singularly fine specimen\r\nof an early Norman chapel. This floor probably contained the royal\r\napartments; it was lighted by windows, not loops. Both the eastern and\r\nwestern rooms had fireplaces; the eastern room goes by the name of the\r\nBanqueting Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe third storey is on a level with the triforium of the chapel.[722]\r\nThis triforium is continued all round the keep as a mural passage, and\r\nit has windows only slightly smaller than those of the floor below.\r\nThese mural galleries are found in most important keeps. As their\r\nwindows were of larger size than the loops which lit the lower floors,\r\nit is possible that they may have been used for defence, either for\r\nthrowing down missiles or for shooting with bows and arrows. But no\r\nnear aim could be taken without a downward splay to the window, and\r\nthe bows of the 11th and 12th centuries were incapable of a long\r\naim. A plausible theory is that they were intended for the march of\r\nsentinels.[723]\r\n\r\nThe masonry of the Tower is of Kentish rag, with ashlar quoins. In\r\nmediæval times it had a forebuilding, with a round stair turret, which\r\nis shown in some old views; but it may reasonably be doubted whether\r\nthis was an original feature.\r\n\r\nAs regards the ground plan of the castle as a whole, it is now\r\nconcentric, but was not so originally. The Tower was certainly placed\r\nin the S.E. angle of the Roman walls of London, and very near the east\r\nwall, portions of which have been discovered.[724] The conversion\r\nof the castle into one of the concentric type was the work of later\r\ncenturies, and the history of its development has still to be\r\ntraced.[725]\r\n\r\nTREMATON, Cornwall (Fig. 34).--\"The Count [of Mortain] has a castle\r\nthere and a market, rendering 101 shillings.\"[726] Two Cornish castles\r\nare mentioned in Domesday, and both of them are only on the borders\r\nof that wild Keltic country; but while Launceston is inland, Trematon\r\nguards an inlet on the south coast. The position of this castle is\r\nextremely strong by nature, at the end of a high headland; on the\r\nextreme point of this promontory the motte is placed. It carries a\r\nwell-preserved shell wall, which may be of Norman date, from the\r\nplain round arch of the entrance.[727] It has been separated by a\r\nditch from the bailey, but the steepness of the hill rendered it\r\nunnecessary to carry this ditch all round. The bailey, 1 acre in\r\nextent, in which a modern house is situated, still has an entrance\r\ngate of the 13th century, and part of a mediæval wall. A second\r\nbailey, now a rose-garden, has been added at a later period. In spite\r\nof the establishment of a castle and a market the value of the\r\nmanor of Trematon had gone down at the time of the Survey, which may\r\nbe accounted for by the fact that there were only ten ploughs where\r\nthere ought to have been twenty-four. It was only a small manor, and no\r\nburgus is mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. Trematon, Cornwall. Tutbury, Staffs.]\r\n\r\nTUTBURY, Staffordshire (Fig. 34).--In the magnificent earthworks of\r\nthis castle, and the strength of its site, we probably see a testimony\r\nto the ability of Hugh d'Avranches; for we learn from Ordericus that in\r\n1070 William I. gave to Henry de Ferrers the castle of Tutbury, which\r\nhad belonged to Hugh d'Avranches,[728] to whom the king then gave the\r\nmore dangerous but more honourable post of the earldom of Chester.\r\nDomesday Book simply states that Henry de Ferrers has the castle of\r\nTutbury, and that there are forty-two men living by their merchandise\r\nalone in the borough round the castle.[729]\r\n\r\nAt Tutbury the keep was placed on an artificial motte, which itself\r\nstood on a hill of natural rock, defended on the N.W. side by\r\nprecipices. There is no trace of any ditch between the motte and\r\nbailey. At present there is only the ruin of a comparatively modern\r\ntower on the motte, but Shaw states that there was formerly a stone\r\nkeep.[730] A description of Elizabeth's reign says, \"The castle is\r\nsituated upon a round hill, and is circumvironed with a strong wall\r\nof astilar [ashlar] stone.... The king's lodging therein is fair and\r\nstrong, bounded and knit to the wall. And a fair stage hall of timber,\r\nof a great length. Four chambers of timber, and other houses well\r\nupholden, within the walls of the castle.\"[731] The king's lodging\r\nwill no doubt be the closed gatehouse; the custom of erecting gatehouse\r\npalaces arose as early as the 13th century. This account shows how many\r\nof the castle buildings were still of timber in Elizabeth's reign.\r\n\r\nThe bailey is quadrant-shaped, and has the motte at its apex. Its area\r\nis 2-1/2 acres. Its most remarkable feature is that it still retains\r\nits ancient banks on the east side and part of the south, and the\r\nmore recent curtain is carried on top of them. This curtain is of the\r\nsame masonry as the three remaining towers, which are of excellent\r\nPerpendicular work, and are generally attributed to John of Gaunt,\r\nwho held this castle after his marriage with Blanche of Lancaster.\r\nThe first castle was undoubtedly of wood; it was pulled down by\r\norder of Henry I. in 1175,[732] nor does there seem to have been any\r\nresurrection till the time of Earl Thomas of Lancaster at the earliest.\r\n\r\nThough Tutbury was the centre of the Honour of Ferrers, it does not\r\nseem to have been even a manor in Saxon times. The borough was probably\r\nthe creation of the castellan, who also founded the Priory.[733] There\r\nis no statement in the Survey from which we can learn the value T. R.\r\nE., but T. R. W. it was 4_l._ 10_s._\r\n\r\nTYNEMOUTH, Northumberland.--Besieged and taken by William Rufus in\r\n1095.[734] There is no motte there, and probably never was one, as the\r\nsituation is defended by precipitous cliffs on all sides but one, where\r\na deep ditch has been cut across the neck of the headland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. Wallingford, Berks.]\r\n\r\nWALLINGFORD, Berkshire (Fig. 35).--There is good reason to suppose\r\nthat in the _vallum_ of the town of Wallingford we have an interesting\r\nrelic of Saxon times. Wallingford is one of the boroughs enumerated\r\nin the _Burghal Hidage_; it was undoubtedly a fortified town at the\r\ntime of the Conquest,[735] and is called a _burgus_ in Domesday\r\nBook; but there appears to be no evidence to connect it with Roman\r\ntimes except the discovery of a number of Roman coins in the town\r\nand its neighbourhood. No Roman buildings or pavements have ever\r\nbeen found.[736] The Saxon borough was built on the model of a Roman\r\n_chester_: a square with rounded corners. The rampart of Wallingford,\r\nwhich still exists in great part, is entirely of earth, and must\r\nhave been crowned with a wooden wall, such as was still existing at\r\nPortsmouth in Leland's time.[737] The accounts of Wallingford in the\r\ngreat Survey are very full and important. \"King Edward had eight\r\nvirgates in the borough of Wallingford, and in these there were 276\r\nhaughs paying 11_l._ of rent. Eight have been destroyed for the\r\ncastle.\"[738] This Norman castle was placed in the N.E. corner of\r\nthe borough. At present its precincts cover 30 acres,[739] but this\r\nincludes garden grounds, and no doubt represents later enclosures.\r\nNo ancient plan of the castle has been preserved, but from Leland's\r\ndescription there appear to have been three wards in his time, each\r\ndefended by banks and ditches. The inner ward, which was doubtless\r\nthe original one, is rudely oblong in shape; it covers 4-1/2 acres.\r\nLeland says, \"All the goodly buildings, with the towers and dungeon,\r\nbe within the third dyke.\" The motte, which still exists, was on the\r\nsouth-eastern edge of this ward; that is, it was so placed as to\r\noverlook both the borough and the ford over the Thames.[740] It was\r\nditched around, and is said to have had a stone keep on the top; but\r\nno foundations were found when it was recently excavated. It was found\r\nto rest on a foundation of solid masonry several feet thick, sloping\r\nupwards towards the outside, so that it must have stood in a kind of\r\nstone saucer.[741] The masonry which remains in the other parts of the\r\ncastle is evidently none of it of the early Norman period, unless we\r\naccept a fragment of wall which contains courses of tiles. Numerous\r\nbuildings were added in Henry III.'s reign; the walls and battlements\r\nwere repaired, and the _hurdicium_, which had been blown down by a high\r\nwind, was renewed.[742] But the motte and the high banks show clearly\r\nthat the first Norman castle was of wood.\r\n\r\nThe value of the royal borough of Wallingford had considerably risen\r\nsince the Conquest.[743]\r\n\r\nWARWICK (Fig. 36).--Here again we have a castle built on land which\r\nthe Conqueror obtained from a Saxon convent, a positive proof that\r\nthere was no castle there previously. Only a small number of houses\r\nwas destroyed for the castle,[744] and this points to the probability,\r\nwhich is supported by some other evidence, that the castle was built\r\noutside the town. Warwick, of course, was one of the boroughs fortified\r\nby Ethelfleda, and it was doubtless erected to protect the Roman road\r\nfrom Bath to Lincoln, the Foss Way, against the Danes. Domesday Book,\r\nafter mentioning that the king's barons have 112 houses in the borough,\r\nand the abbot of Coventry 36, goes on to say that these houses belong\r\nto the lands which the barons hold outside the city, and are rated\r\nthere.[745] This is one of the passages from which Professor Maitland\r\nhas concluded that the boroughs planted by Ethelfleda and her brother\r\nwere organised on a system of military defence, whereby the magnates\r\nin the country were bound to keep houses in the towns.[746] Ordericus,\r\nafter the well-known passage in which he states that the lack of\r\ncastles in England was one great cause of its easy conquest by the\r\nNormans, says: \"The king _therefore_ founded a castle at Warwick, and\r\ngave it in custody to Henry, son of Roger de Beaumont.\"[747] Putting\r\nthese various facts together, we may fairly assert that the motte\r\nwhich still forms part of the castle of Warwick was the work of the\r\nConqueror, and not, as Mr Freeman believed, \"a monument of the wisdom\r\nand energy of the mighty daughter of Alfred,\"[748] whose energy was\r\nvery much better employed in the protection of her people. Dugdale,\r\nwho also put the motte down to Ethelfleda, was only copying Rous, a\r\nvery imaginative writer of the 15th century.\r\n\r\nThe motte of Warwick is mentioned several times in the _Pipe Rolls_\r\nof Henry II.; it then carried wooden structures on its top.[749] In\r\nLeland's time there were still standing on this motte the ruins of a\r\nkeep, which he calls by its Norman name of the Dungeon. A fragment of\r\na polygonal shell wall still remains.[750] But there is not a scrap of\r\nmasonry of Norman date about the castle. The motte, and the earthen\r\nbank which still runs along one side of the court, show that the first\r\ncastle was a wooden one. The bailey is oblong in shape, the motte being\r\noutside it; its area is about 2-1/2 acres.\r\n\r\nThe value of Warwick had doubled since the Conquest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. Warwick. Wigmore, Hereford.]\r\n\r\nWIGMORE, Herefordshire (Fig. 36).--We have already referred to the\r\nabsurdity of identifying this place with the _Wigingamere_ of the\r\n_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_.[751] We have the strongest indication that the\r\nNorman castle at Wigmore was a new erection, since Domesday Book tells\r\nus that William FitzOsbern built it on waste land called Mereston.[752]\r\nThis express statement disposes of the fable in the _Fundationis\r\nHistoria_ of Wigmore Priory, that the castle of Wigmore had belonged\r\nto Edric the Wild, and was rebuilt by Ralph Mortimer.[753] Wigmore had\r\nonly been a small manor of two taxable hides in Saxon times. Whereas\r\nit had then been unproductive, at the date of the Survey there were two\r\nploughs in the demesne, and the borough attached to the castle yielded\r\n7_l._ Here we have another instance of the planting of a borough close\r\nto a castle, and of the revenue which was thus obtained.\r\n\r\nThere is a very large and high motte at Wigmore Castle, of oval shape,\r\non a headland which has been cut off by a deep ditch. The earthen\r\nbanks of its first fortification still remain, enclosing a small ward,\r\nbut on top of them is a wall in masonry, and the ruins of a polygonal\r\nkeep;[754] also the remains of two mural towers. Half-way down the end\r\nof the headland, below the motte, is a small square court, which _may_\r\nhave been the original bailey; below it, again, is a larger half-moon\r\nbailey furnished with walls and towers. But the whole area covered\r\nis only 1 acre. The masonry is none of it earlier than the Decorated\r\nperiod, except one tower in the bailey wall which may be late Norman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37. Winchester. (From a plan by W. Godson, 1750.)]\r\n\r\nWINCHESTER, Hants.--We include Winchester among the castles mentioned\r\nor alluded to in Domesday Book, because we think it can be proved that\r\nthe _domus regis_ mentioned under Alton and Clere is the castle built\r\nby William outside the west gate of the city, where the present County\r\nHall is now almost the only remaining relic of any castle at all.[755]\r\nUnder the head of \"Aulton\" we are told that the abbot of Hyde had\r\nunjustly gotten the manor in exchange for the king's house, because\r\nby the testimony of the jurors it was already the king's house.[756]\r\nThat _excambio domus regis_ should read _excambio terræ domus regis_\r\nis clear from the corresponding entry under Clere, where the words\r\nare _pro excambio terræ in qua domus regis est in civitate_.[757] The\r\nmatter is put beyond a doubt by the confirmatory charter of Henry I. to\r\nHyde Abbey, where the king states that his father gave Aulton and Clere\r\nto Hyde Abbey _in exchange for the land on which he built his hall in\r\nthe city of Winchester_.[758] Where, then, was this hall, which was\r\nclearly new, since fresh land was obtained for it, and which must not\r\ntherefore be sought on the site of the palace of the Saxon kings? The\r\n_Liber Winton_, a roll of Henry I.'s time, says that twelve burgesses'\r\nhouses had been destroyed and the land was now occupied by the king's\r\nhouse.[759] Another passage says that a whole street _outside the west\r\ngate_ was destroyed when the king made his ditch.[760] These passages\r\njustify the conclusion of Mr Smirke that the king's house at Winchester\r\nwas neither more nor less than the castle which existed until the 17th\r\ncentury outside the west gate.[761] Probably the reason why it is\r\nspoken of so frequently in the earliest documents as the king's house\r\nor hall, instead of the castle, is that in this important city, the\r\nancient capital of Wessex, where the king \"wore his crown\" once a\r\nyear, William built, besides the usual wooden keep on the motte, a\r\nstone hall in the bailey, of size and dignity corresponding to the\r\nnew royalty.[762] In fact, the hall so magnificently transformed by\r\nHenry III., and known to be the old hall of the castle, can be seen\r\non careful examination to have still its original Norman walls and\r\nother traces of early Norman work.[763] The palace of the Saxon kings\r\nstood, where we might expect to find the palace of native princes,\r\nin the middle of the city; according to Milner it was on the site of\r\nthe present Square.[764] William may have repaired this palace, but\r\nthat he constructed two royal houses, a palace and a castle, is highly\r\nimprobable. The castle became the residence of the Norman kings, and\r\nthe Saxon palace appears to have been neglected.[765] We see with what\r\ncaution the Conqueror placed his castle at the royal city of Wessex\r\nwithout the walls. Milner tells us that there was no access to it from\r\nthe city without passing through the west gate.[766] The motte of the\r\ncastle appears to have been standing in his time, as he speaks of \"the\r\nartificial mount on which the keep stands.\"[767] It is frequently\r\nmentioned in mediæval documents as the _beumont_ or _beau mont_. It\r\nwas surrounded by its own ditch.[768] The bailey, if Speed's map is\r\ncorrect, was triangular in shape. With its ditches and banks the castle\r\ncovered 6 acres, according to the commissioners who reported on it in\r\nElizabeth's reign; but the inner area cannot have been more than 4-1/2\r\nacres. We may infer from the sums spent on this castle by Henry II.,\r\nthat he was the first to give it walls and towers of stone; the _Pipe\r\nRolls_ show entries to the amount of 1150_l._ during the course of his\r\nreign; the work of the walls is frequently specified, and stone is\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nDomesday Book does not inform us whether the value of Winchester had\r\nrisen or fallen since the Conquest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. Windsor Castle (From Ashmole's \"Order of the\r\nGarter.\")]\r\n\r\nWINDSOR (Fig. 38).--Here we have another of the interesting cases in\r\nwhich the geld due from the tenant of a manor is lessened on account\r\nof a castle having occupied a portion of the land.[769] The Survey\r\ntells us that the castle of Windsor sits in half a hide belonging\r\nto the manor of Clewer, which had become William's property as part\r\nof the spoils of Harold. It was _now_ held of the king by a Norman\r\ntenant-in-chief, but whereas it was formerly rated as five hides it\r\nwas now (that is, probably, since the castle was built) rated as four\r\nand a half hides. Of course we are not to suppose that the castle\r\noccupied the whole half hide, which might be some 60 acres; but it\r\nextinguished the liability of that portion. At Windsor, however, we\r\nhave no occasion to press this argument as a proof that the castle was\r\nnew, since it is well established that the palace of the Saxon kings\r\nwas at least 2 miles from the present castle and town, in the village\r\nlong known as Old Windsor, which fell into decay as the town of Windsor\r\nsprang up under the Norman castle.[770] The manor of Windsor was given\r\nby Edward the Confessor to the convent of Westminster, but recovered by\r\nthe Conqueror.[771] But as the Survey shows us, he did not build his\r\ncastle in the manor of Windsor, but in that of Clewer. He built it for\r\na hunting-seat,[772] and it may have been for the purpose of recovering\r\nforest rights that he resumed possession of Old Windsor; but he placed\r\nhis castle in the situation which he thought best for defence. For even\r\na hunting-seat in Norman times was virtually a castle, as many other\r\ninstances show.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to state that there is no masonry at Windsor of the\r\ntime of the Conqueror, or even of the time of his son Henry I., in\r\nspite of the statement of Stowe that Henry \"new builded the castle\r\nof Windsor.\" This statement may perhaps be founded on a passage in\r\nthe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ which says that Henry held his court for\r\nthe first time in the New Windsor in 1110. Perhaps the _Chronicle_\r\nhere refers to the _borough_ of New Windsor, as an entry in the _Pipe\r\nRoll_ of Henry I. seems to show that he was the first to enclose the\r\n_burgus_ of Windsor.[773] For it is probable that the first stone\r\ncastle at Windsor was built by Henry II., who spent £1670 on it in the\r\ncourse of his reign. One of his first acts after his accession was an\r\nexchange of land at Windsor, which seems to have been for the purpose\r\nof a vineyard, and was possibly the origin of the second bailey.[774]\r\nAt present the position of the motte is central to the rest of the\r\ncastle, but this is so unusual that it suggests the idea that the upper\r\nward is the oldest, and that the motte stood on its outer edge. Henry\r\nII. surrounded the castle with a wall, at a cost of about 128_l._[775]\r\nThe other entries in the _Pipe Rolls_ probably refer to the first\r\nstone shell on the motte, and there is little doubt that the present\r\nRound Tower, though its height has been raised in modern times, and\r\nits masonry re-dressed and re-pointed so as to destroy all appearance\r\nof antiquity, is in the main of Henry II.'s building. The frequent\r\npayments for stone show the nature of Henry's work.\r\n\r\nAlthough so much masonry was put up in Henry II.'s reign, the greater\r\npart of what is now visible is not older than the time of Henry III.\r\nThe lower bailey seems to have been enlarged in his reign, as the\r\ncastle ditch was extended towards the town, and compensation given\r\nfor houses taken down.[776] The upper (probably the original) ward is\r\nrectangular in shape, and with the motte and its ditches covers about\r\n6-1/2 acres.[777] The state apartments, a chapel, and the Hall of\r\nSt George, are in the upper ward, showing that this was the site of\r\nthe original hall and chapel of the castle. The charter of agreement\r\nbetween Stephen and Henry in 1153 speaks of the _motte_ of Windsor as\r\nequivalent to the castle.[778] Repairs of the motte are mentioned in\r\nthe _Pipe Rolls_ of Henry II.[779]\r\n\r\nThe value of the manor of Clewer had fallen since the Conquest; that of\r\nWindsor, which was worth 15_l._ T. R. E., but after the Conquest fell\r\nto 7_l._, was again worth 15_l._ at the date of the Survey.[780]\r\n\r\nWISBEACH, Cambridgeshire.--William I. built a castle here in 1072,\r\nafter suppressing the revolt of Hereward, in order to hold in check the\r\nCambridgeshire fen country.[781] There is an early mention of it in\r\nthe Register of Thorney Abbey. This castle, after being several times\r\nrebuilt, is now completely destroyed, and \"several rows of elegant\r\nhouses built on the site.\" Nevertheless, there still remain distinct\r\ntraces of the motte-and-bailey pattern in the gardens which now occupy\r\nthe site of the original castle of King William; the present Crescent\r\nprobably follows the line of the ditch. The meagre indications\r\npreserved in casual accounts confirm this. There was an inner castle\r\nof about 2 acres, just the area of the present garden enclosure, and\r\nan outer court, probably an addition, of some 4 acres.[782] Both areas\r\nwere moated. Weston, a prisoner who was confined in the keep of this\r\ncastle in the 17th century, has left an account of his captivity,\r\nin which he casually mentions that the keep or dungeon stood upon a\r\nhigh terrace, from which he could overlook the outer bailey, and was\r\nsurrounded by a moat filled with water.[783]\r\n\r\nThe castle is not mentioned in Domesday, but as might be expected in a\r\ndistrict which had been so ravaged by war, the value of the manor had\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\nWORCESTER.--This borough, as we have seen, was fortified by Ethelfleda\r\nand her husband Ethelred in the 9th century. That the fortifications\r\nthus erected were those of a city and not of a castle is shown with\r\nsufficient clearness by the remarkable charter of this remarkable pair,\r\nin which they declare that they have built the _burh_ at Worcester to\r\nshelter all the people, and the churches, and the bishop.[784] The\r\ncastle is first mentioned in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ in 1088, and\r\nit is to be noted that it is styled the king's castle. Urse d'Abitot,\r\nthe Norman sheriff of Worcester, has the credit of having built the\r\nfirst castle, and Malmesbury relates that he seized part of the monks'\r\ncemetery for the bailey.[785] The monks, however, held on to their\r\nright, and in the first year of Henry III. the bailey was restored to\r\nthem by the guardians of the young king, the motte being reserved for\r\nthe king's use.[786] The first wooden castle was burnt in 1113.[787]\r\nThe tower or keep which succeeded it, and which was repaired by Henry\r\nII.,[788] may have been either of stone or wood; but in the order of\r\nJohn, that the gateway of the castle, which is of wood, is to be made\r\nof stone, we get a hint of the gradual transformation of the castle\r\nfrom a wooden to a stone fortress.[789]\r\n\r\nWorcester Castle was outside the town, from Speed's map, and was near\r\nthe Severn. The area now called College Green was no doubt the outer\r\nward of the castle, which was restored to the convent by Henry III.\r\nThe tower called Edgar's Tower was built by the monks as the gatehouse\r\nto their newly conceded close.[790] From the map given by Green, this\r\nouter bailey appears to have been roughly square; but there was also\r\na small oblong inner ward, retained by the king, where the gaol was\r\nafterwards built. The area of the castle is said to have been between\r\n3 and 4 acres.[791] The motte, which is mentioned several times in\r\nmediæval documents,[792] was completely levelled in 1848; it was then\r\nfound out that it had been thrown up over some previous buildings,\r\nwhich were believed to be Roman, though this seems doubtful.[793]\r\n\r\nThe value of Worcester had risen since the Conquest.[794]\r\n\r\nYORK (Fig. 39).--William the Conqueror built two castles at York, and\r\nthe mottes of both these castles remain, one underneath Clifford's\r\nTower, the keep of York Castle, the other, on the south side of the\r\nOuse, still bearing the name of the Baile Hill, or the Old Baile.[795]\r\nThe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ implies, though it does not directly\r\nstate, that both these castles were built in 1068, on the occasion of\r\nWilliam's first visit to York. The more detailed narrative of Ordericus\r\nshows that one was built in 1068, and the other at the beginning of\r\n1069, on William's second visit.[796] Both were destroyed in September\r\n1069, when the English and Danes captured York, and both were rebuilt\r\nbefore Christmas of the same year, when William held his triumphant\r\nChristmas feast at York.\r\n\r\nThis speedy erection, destruction, and re-erection is enough to\r\nprove that the castles of William in York were, like most other\r\nNorman castles, hills of earth with buildings and stockades of wood,\r\nespecially as we find these hills of earth still remaining on the\r\nknown sites of the castles. And we may be quite sure that the Norman\r\nmasonry, which Mr Freeman pictures as so eagerly destroyed by the\r\nEnglish, never existed.[797] But the obstinate tendency of the human\r\nmind to make things out older than they are has led to these earthen\r\nhills being assigned to Britons, Romans, Saxons, Danes, anybody rather\r\nthan Normans. A single passage of William of Malmesbury, in which he\r\nrefers to the _castrum_ which the Danes had built at York in the reign\r\nof Athelstan, is the sole vestige of basis for the theory that the\r\nmotte of Clifford's Tower is of Danish origin.[798] The other theories\r\nhave absolutely no foundation but conjecture. If Malmesbury was quoting\r\nfrom some older source which is now lost, it is extremely probable\r\nthat the word _castrum_ which he copied, did not mean a castle in our\r\nsense of the word at all, but was a translation of the word _burh_,\r\nwhich almost certainly referred to a vallum or wall constructed round\r\nthe Danish suburb outside the walls of York. Such a suburb there was,\r\nfor there in 1055 stood the Danish church of St Olave, in which Earl\r\nSiward was buried, and the suburb was long known as the Earlsburgh\r\nor Earl's Burh, probably because it contained the residence of the\r\nDanish earls of Northumbria.[799] This suburb was not anywhere near\r\nClifford's Tower, but in quite a different part of the city. To prove\r\nthat both the mottes were on entirely new sites, we have the assurance\r\nof Domesday Book that out of the seven _shires_ or wards into which the\r\ncity was divided, one was laid waste for the castles; so that there\r\nwas clearly a great destruction of houses to make room for the new\r\ncastles.[800]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. York Castle and Baile Hill. (From a plan by P.\r\nChassereau, 1750.)]\r\n\r\nWhat has been assumed above receives striking confirmation from\r\nexcavations made recently (1903) in the motte of Clifford's Tower.\r\nAt the depth of 13 feet were found remains of a wooden structure,\r\nsurmounted by a quantity of charred wood.[801] Now the accounts of\r\nthe destruction of the castles in 1069 do not tell us that they were\r\nburned, but thrown down and broken to pieces.[802] But the keep\r\nwhich was restored by William, and on the repair of which Henry II.\r\nspent 15_l._ in 1172,[803] was burnt down in the frightful massacre\r\nof the Jews at York Castle in 1190.[804] The excavations disclosed\r\nthe interesting fact that this castle stood on a lower motte than\r\nthe present one, and that when the burnt keep was replaced by a new\r\none the motte was raised to its present height, \"an outer crust of\r\nfirmer and more clayey material being made round the older summit,\r\nand a lighter material placed inside this crater to bring it up to\r\nthe necessary level.\" This restoration must have taken place in the\r\nthird year of Richard I., when 28_l._ was spent \"on the work of the\r\ncastle.\"[805] This small sum shows that the new keep also was of wood;\r\nand remains of timber work were in fact found on the top of the motte\r\nduring the excavations, though unfortunately they were not sufficiently\r\nfollowed up to determine whether they belonged to a wooden tower or\r\nto a platform intended to consolidate the motte.[806] It is extremely\r\nlikely that this third keep was blown down by the high wind of 1228,\r\nwhen 2s. was paid \"for collecting the timber of York Castle blown down\r\nby the wind.\"[807] In its place arose the present keep, one of the\r\nmost remarkable achievements of the reign of Henry III.[808] The old\r\nground-plan of the square Norman keep was now abandoned, and replaced\r\nby a quatrefoil. The work occupied thirteen years, from the 30th to\r\nthe 43rd Henry III., and the total sum expended was 1927_l._ 8_s._\r\n7_d._, equal to about 40,000_l._ of our money. This remarkable fact has\r\nslumbered in the unpublished _Pipe Rolls_ for 700 years, never having\r\nbeen unearthed by any of the numerous historians of York.\r\n\r\nThe keep was probably the first work in stone at York Castle, and for\r\na long time it was probably the only defensive masonry. The banks\r\ncertainly had only a wooden stockade in the early part of Henry III.'s\r\nreign, as timber from the forest of Galtres was ordered for the repair\r\nof breaches in the _palicium_ in 1225.[809] As late as Edward II.'s\r\nreign there was a _pelum_, or stockade, round the keep, on top of a\r\n_murus_, which was undoubtedly an earthen bank.[810] At present the\r\nkeep occupies the whole top of the motte except a small _chemin de\r\nronde_, but the fact so frequently alluded to in the writs, that a\r\nstockade ran round the keep, proves that a small courtyard existed\r\nthere formerly, as was usually the case with important keeps. Another\r\nwrit of Edward II.'s reign shows that the motte was liable to injury\r\nfrom the floods of the River Fosse,[811] and probably its size has thus\r\nbeen reduced.\r\n\r\nThe present bailey of York Castle does not follow the lines of the\r\noriginal one, but is an enlargement made in 1825. A plan made in 1750,\r\nand reproduced here, shows that the motte was surrounded by its own\r\nditch, which is now filled up, and that the bailey, around which a\r\nbranch of the Fosse was carried, was of the very common bean-shaped\r\nform; it was about 3 acres in extent. The motte and bailey were both\r\nconsiderably outside what is believed to have been the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrampart of York,[812] but the motte was so placed as to overlook the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe value of the city of York, in spite of the sieges and sacks which\r\nit had undergone, and in spite of there being 540 houses \"so empty\r\nthat they pay nothing at all,\" had risen at the date of the Survey\r\nfrom 53_l_. in King Edward's time to 100_l._ in King William's.[813]\r\nThis extraordinary rise in value can only be attributed to increased\r\ntrade and increased exactions, the former being promoted by the greater\r\nsecurity given to the roads by the castles, the latter due to the tolls\r\non the high-roads and waterways, which belonged to the king, and the\r\nvarious \"customs\" belonging to the castles, which, though new, were\r\nhenceforth equally part of his rights.\r\n\r\nTHE BAILE HILL, York (Fig. 39).--There can be no doubt whatever that\r\nthis still existing motte was the site of one of William's castles\r\nat York, and it is even probable that it was the older of the two,\r\nas Mr Cooper conjectures from its position on the south side of the\r\nriver.[814] The castle bore the name of the Old Baile at least as early\r\nas the 14th century, perhaps even in the 12th.[815] In 1326 a dispute\r\narose between the citizens of York and Archbishop William de Melton as\r\nto which of them ought to repair the wall around the Old Baile. The\r\nmayor alleged that the district was under the express jurisdiction of\r\nthe archbishop, exempt from that of the city; the archbishop pleaded\r\nthat it stood within the ditches of the city.[816] The meaning of\r\nthis dispute can only be understood in the light of facts which have\r\nrecently been unearthed by the industry and observation of Mr T. P.\r\nCooper, of York.[817] The Old Baile, like so many of William's castles,\r\noriginally stood outside the ramparts of the city. The original Roman\r\nwalls of York (it is believed) enclosed only a small space on the\r\neastern shore of the Ouse, and before the Norman Conquest the city\r\nhad far outgrown these bounds, and therefore had been enlarged in\r\nAnglo-Saxon times. It appears that the Micklegate suburb was then for\r\nthe first time enclosed with a wall, and as this district is spoken of\r\nin Domesday Book as \"the shire of the archbishop,\" it was evidently\r\nunder his jurisdiction. At a later period this wall was buried in an\r\nearthen bank, which probably carried a palisade on top, until the\r\npalisade was replaced by stone walls in the reign of Henry III.[818]\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the actual remains renders it more than probable that\r\nthis rampart turned towards the river at a point 500 feet short of\r\nits present angle, so that the Old Baile, when first built, was quite\r\noutside the city walls.[819] This is exactly how we should expect to\r\nfind a castle of William the Norman's in relation to one of the most\r\nturbulent cities of the realm; and, as we have seen, the other castle\r\nat York was similarly placed. By the time of Archbishop Melton the\r\nsouth-western suburb was already enclosed in the new stone walls built\r\nin the 13th century, and these walls had been carried along the west\r\nand south banks of the Old Baile, so as to enclose that castle within\r\nthe city. This was the archbishop's pretext for trying to lay upon\r\nthe citizens the duty of maintaining the Old Baile. But probably on\r\naccount of his ancient authority in this part of the city, the cause\r\nwent against him; though he stipulated that whatever he did in the way\r\nof fortification was of his own option, and was not to be accounted\r\na precedent. A contemporary chronicler says that he enclosed the Old\r\nBaile first with stout planks 18 feet long, afterwards with a stone\r\nwall:[820] an interesting proof that wooden fortifications were still\r\nused in the reign of Edward III.\r\n\r\nThough the base court of the Old Baile is now built over, its area and\r\nditches were visible in Leland's time,[821] and can still be guessed\r\nat by the indications Mr Cooper has noted. The area of the bailey must\r\nhave been nearly 3 acres, and its shape nearly square. This measurement\r\nincludes the motte, which was placed in the south-west corner on\r\nthe line of the banks; it thus overlooked the river as well as the\r\ncity.[822]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMOTTE-CASTLES IN NORTH WALES\r\n\r\n\r\nMotte-castles are as common in Wales as they are in England, and in\r\ncertain districts much more common. It is now our task to show how they\r\ngot there. They were certainly not built (in the first instance at any\r\nrate) by the native inhabitants, for they do not correspond to what we\r\nknow to have been the state of society in Wales during the Anglo-Saxon\r\nperiod.[823] The Welsh were then in the tribal condition, a condition,\r\nas we have shown, inconsistent with the existence of the private\r\ncastle. The residence of the king or chieftain, as we know from the\r\nWelsh Laws, was a great hall, such as seems to have been the type of\r\nchieftains' residence among all the northern nations at that time. \"It\r\nwas adapted for the joint occupation of a number of tribesmen living\r\ntogether.\"[824]\r\n\r\nPennant describes the residence of Ednowen, a Welsh chieftain of the\r\n12th century, as follows: \"The remains are about 30 yards square; the\r\nentrance about 7 feet wide, with a large upright stone on each side\r\nfor a doorcase; the walls were formed of large stones uncemented by\r\nany mortar; in short the structure shows the very low state of Welsh\r\narchitecture at this time; it may be paralleled only by the artless\r\nfabric of a cattle-house.\"[825] This certainly is a hall and not a\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Dimetian Code indeed tells us that the king is to have\r\na man and a horse from every hamlet, with hatchets for constructing\r\nhis castles (gestyll) at the king's cost; but the Venedotian Code,\r\nwhich is the older MS., says that these hatchet-men are to form\r\nencampments (uuesten); that is, they are to cut down trees and form\r\neither stockades on banks or rude _zerebas_ for the protection of\r\nthe host.[826] It is clearly laid down in the Codes what buildings\r\nthe king's villeins are to erect for him at his residences: a hall,\r\nbuttery, kitchen, dormitory, stable, dog-house, and little house.[827]\r\nIn none of these lists is anything mentioned which has the smallest\r\nresemblance to a castle, not even a tower. We can imagine that these\r\nbuildings were enclosed in an earthwork or stockade, but it is not\r\nmentioned.[828]\r\n\r\nWales was never one state, except for very short periods. Normally\r\nit was divided into three states, Gwynedd or North Wales, Powys or\r\nMid-Wales, and Deheubarth, all almost incessantly at war with each\r\nother.[829] Other subdivisions asserted themselves as opportunity\r\noffered, so that the above rough division into provinces must not be\r\nregarded as always accurate. A Wales thus divided, and perpetually\r\nrent by internal conflicts, invited the aggression of the Saxons, and\r\nit is probable that the complete subjugation of Britain would have\r\nbeen accomplished by the descendants of Alfred, if it had not been\r\nfor the Danish invasions. The position of the Welsh kings after the\r\ntime of Athelstan seems to have been that of tributaries, who threw\r\noff their allegiance whenever it was possible to do so. But still\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon frontier continued to advance. Professor Lloyd has\r\nshown, from a careful examination of Domesday Book, that even before\r\nthe Norman Conquest the English held the greater part of what is now\r\nFlintshire and East Denbighshire, and were advancing into the vale of\r\nMontgomery and the Radnor district.[830] The victories of Griffith ap\r\nLlywelyn, an able prince who succeeded in bringing all Wales under\r\nhis sway, devastated these English colonies; but his defeat by Earl\r\nHarold in 1063 restored the English ascendancy over these regions.\r\nThe unimpeachable evidence of Domesday Book shows that a considerable\r\ndistrict in North Wales and a portion of Radnor were held respectively\r\nby Earl Edwin and Earl Harold before the Norman Conquest. Moreover, the\r\nfact mentioned by the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ in 1065, that Harold was\r\nbuilding a hunting-seat for King Edward at Portskewet, _after he had\r\nsubdued it_, suggests that the land between Wye and Usk, which Domesday\r\nBook reckons under Gloucestershire, was a conquest of Harold's.[831]\r\n\r\nThe Norman Conqueror was not the man to slacken his hold on any\r\nterritory which had been won by the Saxons. But there is no succinct\r\nhistory of his conquests in Wales; we have to make it out, in most\r\ncases, from notices that are scarcely more than allusive, and from\r\nthe surer, though scanty, ground of documents. It is noteworthy that\r\nthe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ is so hostile to the Norman kings that it\r\ndiscounts their successes in Wales. Thus we have only the briefest\r\nnotice of William I.'s invasion of South Wales, which was very probably\r\nthe beginning of the conquest of that region; and several expeditions\r\nof William II. are spoken of as entirely futile, though as we are\r\ntold that the existing castles were still held by the Normans, or new\r\nones were built, it is clear that this summing-up is not strictly\r\ncorrect.[832] Our Welsh authorities, the _Annales Cambriæ_ and the\r\n_Brut y Tywysogion_,[833] seem to give a fairly candid account of the\r\nperiod, although the dates in the _Brut_ are for the most part wrong\r\n(sometimes by three years), and they hardly ever give us a view of the\r\nsituation as a whole. They tell us when the Welsh rushed down and burnt\r\nthe castles built by the Normans in the conquered districts, but do\r\nnot always tell when the Normans recovered and rebuilt them.\r\n\r\nFortunately we are not called upon here to trace the history of the\r\ncruel and barbarous warfare between Normans and Welsh. No one can turn\r\nthat bloodstained page without wishing that the final conquest had come\r\ntwo hundred years earlier, to put an end to the tragedy of suffering\r\nwhich must have been so largely the portion of the dwellers in Wales\r\nand the Marches after the coming of the Normans.[834] Our business\r\nwith both Welsh and Normans is purely archæological. We hold no brief\r\nfor the Normans, nor does it matter to us whether they kept their\r\nhold on Wales or were driven out by the Welsh; our concern is with\r\nfacts, and the solid facts with which we have to deal are the castles\r\nwhose remains still exist in Wales, and whose significance we have to\r\ninterpret.\r\n\r\n\"Wales was under his sway, and he built castles therein,\" says the\r\n_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, in summing up the reign of the Conqueror; a\r\npassage which is scarcely consistent with its previous almost complete\r\nsilence about events in Wales. There can be little doubt that William\r\naimed at a complete conquest of Wales, and that the policy he adopted\r\nwas the creation of great earldoms along the Welsh border, endowed with\r\nspecial privileges, one of which was the right of conquering whatever\r\nthey could from the Welsh.[835] To these earldoms he appointed some\r\nof his strongest men, men little troubled by scruples of justice or\r\nmercy, but capable leaders in war or diplomacy. It was an essential\r\npart of the plan that every conquest should be secured by the building\r\nof castles, just as had been done in England. And we have now to trace\r\nvery briefly the outline of Norman conquest in Wales by the castles\r\nwhich they have left behind them.\r\n\r\nWe shall confine ourselves to those castles which are mentioned in the\r\n_Brut y Tywysogion_, the _Pipe Rolls_, or other trustworthy documents\r\nbetween 1066 and 1216, the end of King John's reign. Of many of these\r\ncastles only the earthworks remain; of many others the original plan,\r\nexactly similar to that of the early castles of Normandy and France, is\r\nstill to be traced, though masked by the masonry of a later age. Grose\r\nremarked but could not explain the fact that we continually read of the\r\ncastles of the Marches being burnt and utterly destroyed, and a few\r\nmonths later we find them again standing and in working order. This can\r\nonly, but easily, be explained when we understand that they were wooden\r\ncastles built on mottes, quickly restored after a complete destruction\r\nof the wooden buildings.\r\n\r\nNorth Wales appears to have been the earliest conquest of the Normans,\r\nthough not the most lasting. North Wales comprised the Welsh kingdoms\r\nof Gwynedd and Powys. Gwynedd covered the present shires of Anglesea,\r\nCarnarvon, and Merioneth, and the mountainous districts round\r\nSnowdon.[836] Powys stretched from the estuary of the Dee to the upper\r\ncourse of the Wye, and roughly included Flint, Denbigh, Montgomery,\r\nand Radnor shires. Hugh of Avranches, Earl of Chester, was the great\r\ninstrument of Norman conquest in Gwynedd, and in the northern part\r\nof Powys, which lay so near his own dominions. He was evidently a man\r\nin whose ability William had great confidence, as he removed him from\r\nTutbury to the more difficult and dangerous position of Chester, and\r\ngave his earldom palatine privileges; all the land in Cheshire was held\r\nunder the earl, and he was a sort of little king in his county.\r\n\r\nHugh appears to have at once commenced the conquest of North Wales. As\r\nProfessor Lloyd remarks, Domesday Book shows us Deganwy as the most\r\nadvanced Norman post on the North Welsh coast, while on the Bristol\r\nChannel they had got no further than Caerleon.[837] In advancing to the\r\nvalley of the Clwyd and building a castle at Rhuddlan, the Normans were\r\nonly securing the district which had already been conquered by Harold\r\nin 1063, when he burnt the hall of King Griffith at Rhuddlan. Nearly\r\nthe whole of Flintshire (its manors are enumerated by Domesday Book\r\nunder Cheshire) was held by Earl Hugh in 1086, so that he commanded\r\nthe entire road from Chester to Rhuddlan. His powerful vassal, Robert\r\nof Rhuddlan, who became the terror of North Wales, besides the lands\r\nwhich he held of Earl Hugh, held also directly of the King Rhos and\r\nRhufeniog, districts which roughly correspond to the modern shire of\r\nDenbigh, and \"Nort Wales\" which Professor Lloyd takes to mean the\r\nremainder of the principality of Gwynedd, from which the rightful\r\nruler, Griffith ap Cynan, had been driven as an exile to Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that there was any fortification at RHUDDLAN[838]\r\nbefore the \"castle newly erected\" by Earl Hugh and his vassal Robert.\r\nThey shared between them the castle and the _new borough_ which was\r\nbuilt near it.[839] One word about this new borough, which will apply\r\nto the other boroughs planted by Norman castles. There were no towns in\r\nWales of any importance before the Norman Conquest, and this civilising\r\ninstitution of the borough is the one great set-off to the cruelty and\r\nunrighteousness of the conquest. Mills, markets, and trade arose where\r\ncastles were seated, and civilisation followed in their train.\r\n\r\nThe castle of Hugh and Robert was not the magnificent building which\r\nstill stands at Rhuddlan, for that is entirely the work of Edward I.,\r\nand there is documentary evidence that Edward made a purchase of new\r\nland for the site of his castle.[840] More probably Robert and Hugh had\r\na wooden castle on the now reduced motte which may be seen to the south\r\nof Edward's castle. In Gough's time this motte was still \"surrounded\r\nwith a very deep ditch, including the abbey.\" Nothing can be seen of\r\nthis ditch now, except on the south side of the motte, where a deep\r\nravine runs up from the river. As from Gough's description the hillock\r\n(called Tut Hill)[841] was within the precincts of the priory of Black\r\nFriars, founded in the 13th century, it is extremely probable that\r\nEdward gave the site of the old castle to the Dominicans when he built\r\nhis new one.[842]\r\n\r\nAnother of the castles of Robert of Rhuddlan was DEGANWY, or Gannoc,\r\nwhich defended the mouth of the Conway.[843] Here it is said that there\r\nwas an ancient seat of the kings of Gwynedd.[844] The two conical hills\r\nwhich rise here offer an excellent site for fortification, one of them\r\nbeing large enough on top for a considerable camp. The Norman Conqueror\r\ntreated them as two mottes, and connected them by walls so as to form\r\na bailey below them. The stone fortifications are probably the remains\r\nof the castle built by the Earl of Chester in 1211.[845] This castle\r\nwas naturally a sorely contested point, and often passed from hand to\r\nhand; but it was in English possession in the reign of Henry III. It\r\nwas abandoned when Edward I. built his great castle at Conway.\r\n\r\nWith its usual indifference, the Survey mentions no castle in\r\nFlintshire, but we may be sure that the castle of MOLD, or Montalto\r\n(Fig. 40), was one of the earliest by which the Norman acquisitions in\r\nthat region were defended,[846] though it is not mentioned in authentic\r\nhistory until 1147. The tradition that it was built by Robert de Monte\r\nAlto, one of the barons of the Earl of Chester, is no doubt correct,\r\nthough the assumption of Welsh legend-makers that the _Gwydd Grug_, or\r\ngreat tumulus, from which this castle derives its Welsh name, existed\r\nbefore the castle, may be dismissed as baseless. The motte of Robert de\r\nMonte Alto still exists, and is uncommonly high and perfect; it has two\r\nbaileys, separated by great ditches, and appears to have had a shell on\r\ntop. [D. H. M.] The castle was regarded as specially strong, and its\r\nreduction by Owen Gwynedd in 1147 was one of the sweetest triumphs that\r\nthe Welsh ever won.[847]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--MOTTE-CASTLES OF NORTH WALES. Mold. Welshpool.\r\nWrexham. Mathraval.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the _Life of Griffith ap Cynan_[848] that the Earl of\r\nChester had conquered and incastellated Gwynedd before the accession\r\nof William Rufus. This valuable document unfortunately gives no dates,\r\nbut it mentions in particular the castle at Aberlleinog,[849] one\r\nat Carnarvon, one at Bangor, and one in Merioneth. The motte at\r\nABERLLEINOG, near Beaumaris, still exists, and the half-moon bailey\r\nis traceable, but the curious little round towers and revetting wall\r\nin masonry on the motte were probably built to carry guns at the time\r\nof the Civil War, when this castle was besieged by the Royalists.\r\nAt CARNARVON the magnificent castle of Edward I. has displaced all\r\nformer erections, yet some evidence for a motte-and-bailey plan may\r\nbe found in the fact that the northern portion of the castle has\r\nevidently been once separated by a ditch from the southern, and is\r\nalso much higher.[850] On the hills above BANGOR, Pennant thought he\r\nhad discovered the remains of Earl Hugh's castle, but having carefully\r\nexamined these walls, we are convinced that they never formed part of\r\na castle at all, as they are much too thin; nor are there any vestiges\r\nof earthworks.[851] We are disposed to think that instead of at Bangor,\r\nthe castle of Earl Hugh was at ABER, often spoken of as ABERMENAI in\r\nthe _Chronicles_, and evidently the most important port on the Straits.\r\nAt Aber there still remains a motte which must have belonged to an\r\nimportant castle, as it was afterwards one of the seats of Llywelyn\r\nap Jorwerth, Prince of Gwynedd. The castle in Merioneth cannot be\r\ncertainly identified.\r\n\r\nIn one of the invasions of William Rufus, which both the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_ and the _Brut_ describe as so unsuccessful, we hear that he\r\nencamped at MUR CASTELL, a place undoubtedly the same as what is now\r\ncalled TOMEN-Y-MUR, a motte standing just inside a Roman camp, on the\r\nRoman road leading from Shropshire into Merioneth and Carnarvon. This\r\nmotte is surrounded by a ditch; there are traces of the usual earthen\r\nrampart round the top, now mutilated by landslips.[852] We may, with\r\ngreat probability, assume that this motte was thrown up by William\r\nRufus, and that the Roman camp served as a bailey for his invading\r\nhost. Whether it was garrisoned for the Normans we cannot say, but it\r\nevidently formed an important post on a route often followed by their\r\ninvading armies, as Henry I. is said to have encamped there twice.[853]\r\nIt is one of the few mottes which stand in a wild and mountainous\r\nsituation, and its purpose no doubt was purely military.[854]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earls of Chester did not retain the sovereignty of Gwynedd; on the\r\ndeath of Rufus, Griffith ap Cynan returned, and obtained possession\r\nof Anglesea. He was favourably received at the court of Henry I., and\r\ngradually recovered possession of the whole of Gwynedd. In 1114 Henry\r\nhad to undertake a great expedition against him to enforce the payment\r\nof tribute;[855] from which, and from the peaceful manner in which\r\nGriffith seems to have acquired his principality, we may infer that\r\nthis tribute was the bargain of his possession. It very likely suited\r\nHenry's policy better to have a tributary Welsh prince than a too\r\npowerful earl of Chester.\r\n\r\nThe reigns of the three first Norman kings were the time in which\r\nNorman supremacy in Wales made its greatest advances. With the\r\naccession of Stephen and the civil war which followed it came the\r\ngreat opportunity for the Welsh of throwing off the Norman yoke. Powys\r\nappears to have been the only province which remained faithful to the\r\nEnglish allegiance, under Madoc ap Meredith.[856] The history of Norman\r\nconquest in Powys is more confused than that of Gwynedd, but Domesday\r\nshows us that Rainald, the Sheriff of Shropshire, a vassal of Earl\r\nRoger of Shrewsbury, was seated at Edeyrnion and Cynlle, two districts\r\nalong the upper valley of the Dee.[857] Robert of Rhuddlan held part of\r\nhis grant of \"Nort Wales,\" namely the hundred of Arwystli, in the very\r\ncentre of Wales, under Earl Roger. Professor Lloyd remarks, \"Earl Roger\r\nclaimed the same authority over Powys as Earl Hugh over Gwynedd, and\r\nthe theory that the princes of this region were subject to the lords of\r\nSalop survived the fall of the House of Montgomery.\"[858]\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of Earl Roger de Montgomeri and his brood of\r\nable and unscrupulous sons.[859] The palatine earldom of Shrewsbury\r\nlay along the eastern border of central Powys, and must soon have\r\nproved a menace to that Welsh kingdom. Domesday Book shows us that\r\nEarl Roger had already planted his castle of Montgomery well within\r\nthe Welsh border at that date. But the ambition of Earl Roger and his\r\nsons stretched beyond their immediate borders. It is probable that\r\nthey used the upper Severn valley, which they fortified by the castle\r\nof Montgomery, and possibly by the castle of Welshpool, as their road\r\ninto Ceredigion, for we find Earl Roger named by the _Brut_ as the\r\nbuilder of the castle of Cilgerran,[860] and some say of Cardigan also.\r\nPossibly he was helping his son Arnolf in the conquest of Pembroke. In\r\n1098 we find his successor, Earl Hugh, allied with the Earl of Chester\r\nin the invasion of Anglesea.\r\n\r\nMONTGOMERY.--This castle is named from the ancestral seat of its\r\nfounder.[861] The motte-and-bailey plan is still very apparent in the\r\nruins, though the motte is represented by a precipitous rock, only a\r\nfew feet higher than the baileys attached, and separated from them\r\nby a ditch cut through the headland. The masonry, the chief part of\r\nwhich is the shell wall and towers on this isolated rock, is none of\r\nit older than the reign of Henry III., when large sums were spent\r\non this castle, and it is spoken of in a writ as \"the new Castle of\r\nMontgomery.\"[862] Yet even then the whole of the defences were not\r\nremade in stone, as bretasches of timber are ordered in a _mandamus_ of\r\n1223.[863] The four wards are all roughly rectilateral. The castle was\r\nnever recovered permanently by the Welsh, and after the forfeiture of\r\nRobert Belesme, the third Earl of Shrewsbury, in 1101, the Crown kept\r\nthis important border fortress in its own hands throughout the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nAlthough Montgomery Castle is the only one mentioned in that region\r\nat the same date, there must have been many others, for in 1225 Henry\r\nIII. ordered all who had mottes in the valley of Montgomery to fortify\r\nthem with good bretasches without delay;[864] and the remains of these\r\nmottes are still numerous in the valley. It is quite possible that the\r\nmottes at Moat Lane and Llandinam were thrown up to defend the road\r\ninto Arwystli; but this is conjecture.[865]\r\n\r\nWELSHPOOL, _alias_ Pol or Pool (Fig. 40), is also called the Castle of\r\nTrallung.--In Powell's _History of Wales_ (p. 137) it is stated that\r\nCadwgan ap Bleddyn, when Henry I. took Cardigan from him, retired to\r\nPowys, and began to build a castle here. Powell's statements, however,\r\nhave no authority when unconfirmed, and we are unable to find any\r\nconfirmation of this statement in the more trustworthy version of the\r\n_Brut_. And as the House of Montgomeri was firmly established in the\r\nvalley of Montgomery as early as 1086, it seems more probable that\r\nthe two motte-and-bailey castles at Welshpool, lower down the Severn\r\nvalley, are relics of the early progress of that family, especially\r\nas one of these castles is only about a mile east of Offa's Dyke, the\r\nancient border. This latter motte is partly cut into by the railway,\r\nand diminished in size, but the bailey is nearly perfect. The other\r\none is in the park of Powys Castle, and is an admirable specimen of\r\nits class. The breastwork round the top of the motte remains. [H. W.]\r\nIt seems probable that this was the precursor of Powys Castle, and was\r\nabandoned at an early period, as the newer castle was known by the name\r\nof Castell Coch, or the Red Castle, as early as 1233.[866] Leland\r\nstates that there were formerly two castles of two different Lords\r\nMarchers at Welshpool;[867] possibly this throws some light on the\r\nexistence of these two motte-castles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Henry II. came to the throne in 1154, one of the many questions\r\nwhich he had to settle was the Welsh question. His first expedition\r\nagainst North Wales was in 1157. Here he was one day placed in grave\r\ndifficulties, and fortune was only restored by his personal courage.\r\nBut in spite of this we learn even from the Welsh chronicler that\r\nhe continued his advance to Rhuddlan, and that the object of the\r\nexpedition, which was the restoration of Cadwalader, one of the sons\r\nof Griffith ap Cynan, to his lands, was accomplished. The English\r\nchronicler Roger of Wendover says that Henry recovered all the\r\nfortresses which had been taken from his predecessors, and rebuilt\r\nBasingwerk Castle; and when he had reduced the Welsh to submission,\r\nreturned in triumph to England. The undoubted facts of the _Pipe Rolls_\r\nshow us that in the year 1159 Henry had in his hands the castles of\r\nOverton, Hodesley, Wrexham, Dernio, Ruthin, and Rhuddlan, castles\r\nwhich would give him command of the whole of Flintshire and of East\r\nDenbigh and the valley of the Clwyd. Similarly, after the expedition\r\nof 1165, sometimes stated to have been only disastrous, we find him in\r\npossession of the castles of Rhuddlan, Basingwerk, Prestatyn, Mold,\r\nOverton, and Chirk;[868] so that after the battle of Crogen, or Chirk,\r\nhe actually held the battlefield.\r\n\r\nWe are thus introduced to an entirely new group of castles, Rhuddlan\r\nbeing the only one which we have heard of before. But it is highly\r\nprobable that most of these castles were originally raised by the earls\r\nof Chester or Shrewsbury, and were in Henry's hands by escheat.\r\n\r\n*BASINGWERK.--The _werk_ referred to in this name has probably nothing\r\nto do with the castle, but refers to Wat's Dyke, which reaches the\r\nDee at this point. The abbey at this place was founded by an earl\r\nof Chester,[869] which makes it probable that the castle also was\r\noriginally his work, especially as Wendover says that Henry _rebuilt_\r\nit. There is no trace of a castle near the abbey,[870] but less than\r\na mile off, near Holywell Church, there is a headland called Bryn\r\ny Castell, with a small mound at the farther end, which has far\r\nmore claim to be the site of Basingwerk Castle, especially as it is\r\nmentioned in John's reign (when it was retaken from the Welsh) as the\r\ncastle of Haliwell.[871]\r\n\r\nOVERTON, in East Denbigh, on the middle course of the Dee. In custody\r\nof Roger de Powys for the king in 1159-1160. As Leland speaks of the\r\nditches and hill of the castle, it was probably a motte-castle of the\r\nusual type. \"One parte of the ditches and Hille of the castel yet\r\nremaynith; the residew is in the botom of Dee.\"[872] It is probably all\r\nthere now, as not a vestige can be traced. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nDERNIO, or Dernant.--There can be no question that Dernio is\r\nEdeyrnion, the valley stretching from Bala Lake to Corwen. Domesday\r\nBook tells us that Rainald the Sheriff, a \"man\" of Earl Roger of\r\nShrewsbury, held two \"fines\" in Wales, Chenlei and Dernio, that is,\r\nCynllaith and Edeyrnion.[873] Towards the end of the 11th century there\r\nmust have been a Norman castle at Rug in Edeyrnion, as it was to this\r\nplace that the earls of Chester and Shrewsbury enticed Griffith ap\r\nCynan, the rightful ruler of Gwynedd; they then sent him prisoner to\r\nChester for twelve years.[874] Very likely the castle of Dernio, which\r\nHenry II. was putting into a state of defence in 1159,[875] was at RUG,\r\n1-1/2 miles from Corwen, where there is still a motte in some private\r\ngrounds, and there was formerly a bailey also.[876] The place was the\r\nseat of an important family in later times. At any rate, the castle was\r\nin Edeyrnion, and shows that Henry was holding the northern part of\r\nMerionethshire.\r\n\r\nHODESLEY; undoubtedly \"The Rofts\" near Gresford, a motte with remains\r\nof a bailey, on a headland above the river Alyn. It is in the former\r\nlordship of Hoseley.[877]\r\n\r\nWREXHAM, the Wristlesham of the _Pipe Rolls_ (Fig. 40).--Henry was\r\npaying for the custody of this castle and that of Hoseley in 1160 and\r\n1161. Both castles are in the district of Bromfield, which was one of\r\nthe early acquisitions of the earls of Chester. Mr Palmer remarks that\r\nthis district was probably ceded to the princes of Powys, in return for\r\nthe help which they often rendered to the English king against other\r\nWelsh princes, as it is found as part of Powys at a later period.[878]\r\nThere are no remains of any castle at Wrexham itself, but about a mile\r\noff, in Erddig Park, there is a motte and bailey of considerable size\r\n(though the motte is reduced) showing that a castle of some importance\r\nonce stood there. There were formerly some remains of masonry.[879]\r\nWat's Dyke has been utilised to form one side of the bailey. It is\r\nprobable that the importance of the two Bromfield castles, Wrexham and\r\nHoseley, was lost when the princes of Powys built their castle on Dinas\r\nBran.\r\n\r\n*RUTHIN.--This important castle, defending the upper valley of the\r\nClwyd, was probably in existence long before Henry II. repaired it in\r\n1160, and may perhaps be attributed to Earl Hugh of Chester. The plan\r\nshows distinctly that it was once a motte and bailey, though the castle\r\nis now transformed into a modern house.[880]\r\n\r\nCHIRK, or Crogen, in the valley of the Ceiriog.--Henry was paying\r\nfor the custody of this castle in 1164, and was provisioning it in\r\n1167.[881] King John paid for the erection of a bretasche there,\r\npossibly after some destruction by the Welsh.[882] Probably the first\r\ncastle of Chirk did not stand in the commanding situation now occupied\r\nby the castle of Edward I.'s reign, but is represented by a small\r\nmotte in a garden near the Ceiriog stream, and close to the church. An\r\nAnglo-Norman poem of the 13th century attributes the first building of\r\nthis castle to William Peverel, Lord of Whittington and Ellesmere, and\r\nsays he placed it \"on the water of Ceiriog.\"[883] No doubt it defended\r\nthe passage of the stream, and an important road into Shropshire.\r\n\r\nPRESTATYN.--This castle defended the coast road from Chester to\r\nRhuddlan. Henry II. granted it to Robert Banaster for his services\r\nin 1165.[884] It was destroyed by Owen Gwynedd in 1167, and does not\r\nappear to have been rebuilt. A low motte with a half-moon bailey, and a\r\nlarger square enclosure, still remain. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr Davis has remarked that John was more successful in extending his\r\nauthority over the British Isles than in anything else.[885] In 1211 he\r\nled an expedition into the heart of Wales, and reduced his son-in-law\r\nLlywelyn ap Jorwerth to complete submission. As usual, the expedition\r\nwas marked by the building or repair of castles. The Earl of Chester\r\nrestored Deganwy, which shows that the English frontier was again\r\nadvanced to the Conway; he also repaired the castle of Holywell, which\r\nthe _Pipe Roll_ shows to have been recovered from the Welsh about this\r\ntime.[886] These _Rolls_ also show that in 1212-1213 John was paying\r\nfor works at the castles of Carreghova, Ruthin, and Chirk, as well as\r\nat the following castles, which have not been mentioned before.\r\n\r\nMATHRAVAL, Madrael in the _Pipe Rolls_ (Fig. 40), near Meifod in\r\nMontgomeryshire, defending the valley of the Vyrnwy.--Here was the\r\nchief royal residence of Powys;[887] but the castle was built in John's\r\nreign by Roger de Vipont. It occupied 2-1/4 acres, and the motte is\r\nin one corner of the area, which is square,[888] and surrounded only\r\nby banks; though ruined foundations are found in parts of the castle.\r\nJohn himself burned the castle in 1211, when the Welsh were besieging\r\nit,[889] but the _Pipe Roll_ (1212-1213) shows that he afterwards\r\nrepaired it. [D. H. M.]\r\n\r\nEGLOE, or Eulo, called by Leland Castle Yollo.--On the Chester and\r\nHolywell road, about 8 miles from Holywell. The mention in the _Pipe\r\nRoll_ of pikes and ammunition provided for this castle in 1212-1213 is\r\nthe first ancient allusion to it with which we are acquainted. It is a\r\nmotte-and-bailey castle, with additions in masonry which are probably\r\nof the reign of Henry III. The keep is of the \"thimble\" plan, a rare\r\ninstance.[890] [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n*YALE.--The _Brut_ tells us that in 1148 (read 1150) Owen Gwynedd built\r\na castle in Yale. Powell identified this with Tomen y Rhodwydd, a motte\r\nand bailey on the road between Llangollen and Ruthin. Yale, however, is\r\nthe name of a district, and there can be little doubt that the castle\r\nof Yale was the motte and bailey at Llanarmon, which for a long period\r\nwas the _caput_ of Yale.[891] Yale undoubtedly belonged to the Normans\r\nwhen Domesday Book was compiled,[892] and it is therefore not unlikely\r\nthat these earthworks were first thrown up by the Earl of Chester. The\r\ncastle was burnt by Jorwerth Goch in 1158, but restored by John in\r\n1212. One of the expenses entered for that year is \"for iron mallets\r\nfor breaking the rocks in the ditch of the castle of Yale.\"[893] This\r\nditch cut in the rock still remains, as well as some foundations on\r\nthe motte,[894] which is known as Tomen y Vardra, or the Mount of the\r\ndemesne.[895]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow long the two last-mentioned groups of castles continued in\r\nAnglo-Norman hands we do not attempt to say. North Wales, as is well\r\nknown, reaped a harvest of new power and prosperity through the\r\ncivil war of the end of John's reign, and the ability of Llywelyn ap\r\nJorwerth. Our task ends with the reign of John. We have only to remark\r\nthat until the _Pipe Rolls_ of Henry III.'s reign have been carefully\r\nsearched, it is impossible to say with certainty what castles of North\r\nWales, or if any, were still held by the English king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMOTTE-CASTLES IN SOUTH WALES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to fix certain dates for all the Norman conquests of\r\nthe several provinces of South Wales. These conquests proceeded from\r\nvarious points, under different leaders. We might have expected that\r\nthe earliest advances would have been on the Herefordshire border,\r\nthe earldom of Hereford having been given by William I. to William\r\nFitzOsbern, one of his most trusted and energetic servants. Ordericus\r\ntells us that FitzOsbern and Walter de Lacy first invaded the district\r\nof Brecknock, and defeated three kings of the Welsh.[896] This looks\r\nas though the conquest of Brecknock was then begun. But it was not\r\ncompleted till the reign of Rufus; in 1093 Bernard of Neufmarché\r\ndefeated and slew Rhys ap Tudor, King of South Wales, in a battle\r\nwhich the Welsh chronicler speaks of as the fall of the kingdom of the\r\nBritons.[897] William FitzOsbern died in 1071, and he had scarcely time\r\nto accomplish more than the building of the border castles of Wigmore,\r\nClifford, Ewias, and Monmouth, and the incastellation of Gwent, that\r\nis the country between the Wye and the Usk, which had already been\r\nconquered by Harold.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that Pembrokeshire was one of the earliest Norman\r\nconquests in South Wales, as in 1073 and 1074 the _Brut_ tells of\r\ntwo expeditions of \"the French\" into Dyfed, a region which included\r\nnot only what we now call Pembrokeshire, but also Strath Towy, which\r\ncomprised an extensive district on both sides of the valley of the\r\nTowy.[898] The _Annales Cambriæ_ name Hugh de Montgomeri, Earl Roger's\r\neldest son, in connection with the second of these expeditions, seven\r\nyears before the expedition of King William into Wales in 1081.[899]\r\nThe House of Montgomeri certainly took the most conspicuous part in\r\nthe conquest of Dyfed and Cardigan, which was completed, according\r\nto the _Brut_, in 1093.[900] Arnulf of Montgomeri, fifth son of Earl\r\nRoger, was the leader of this conquest. But his father must at the same\r\ntime have been operating in Cardigan, as the building of the castle of\r\nCilgerran, which is on the very borders of Pembroke and Cardigan, is\r\nattributed to him.\r\n\r\nHow far Earl Roger made himself master of Ceredigion it is impossible\r\nto say. Later writers say that he built the castle of Cardigan, but\r\nwe have not been able to find any early authority for this statement,\r\nwhich in itself is not improbable. Powell's _History_ makes him do\r\nhomage to William Rufus for the lordship of Cardigan, but here again\r\nthe authority is doubtful.[901] The fact that a castle in or near\r\nAberystwyth was not built until 1109 may indicate that the conquest\r\nof Northern Cardigan was not completed till it became the portion\r\nof the De Clares. This took place in 1109, when Henry I. deposed\r\nCadwgan, a Welsh prince whom he had made Lord of Cardigan, and gave\r\nthe lordship to Gilbert de Clare, who immediately proceeded to build\r\nthe above-mentioned castle, and to restore Earl Roger's castle at\r\nCilgerran (Dingeraint).[902] From this time the castle and district of\r\nCardigan continued to be an appanage of the House of Clare (of course\r\nwith frequent interruptions from Welsh invasions), and of the family\r\nof William Marshall, to whom the Clare lands came by marriage. The\r\nauthority of these earls was suspended during the reign of Henry II.,\r\nwhen he made Rhys ap Griffith, who had possessed himself of Ceredigion\r\nby conquest, Justiciar of South Wales, but in the reigns of John and\r\nHenry III., the _Close Rolls_ show that Cardigan Castle and county were\r\ngenerally in the hands of the Marshalls.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Pembrokeshire must have been closely followed by that\r\nof what is now Carmarthenshire, which was then reckoned as part of\r\nDyfed.[903] We first hear of the castle of Rhyd y Gors in 1094,[904]\r\nbut it evidently existed earlier. This castle we believe to have been\r\nthe important castle of Carmarthen (see _post_). It was founded by\r\nWilliam, son of Baldwin, sheriff of Devon, and cousin of the Gilbert\r\nde Clare who at a later period was made Lord of Cardigan by Henry\r\nI. We thus see at what an early date this important family made its\r\nappearance in Welsh history.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Brecknock (Brecheiniog) we have already briefly\r\nreferred to. It must have begun as early as 1088, for in that year\r\nBernard de Neufmarché gave to St Peter's Abbey at Gloucester the church\r\nand manor of Glasbury. The inheritance of Bernard passed by marriage\r\nto the De Braoses, and from them to the Mortimers. It is convenient\r\nto mention in this connection the Norman conquest of Radnor, of which\r\nthe De Braoses and Mortimers were the heroes. A charter of Philip\r\nde Braose, not later than 1096, is dated at \"Raddenoam.\"[905] Even\r\nduring the anarchy of Stephen's reign, the Mortimers were able to\r\nmaintain their hold on this district, for the _Brut_ relates that in\r\n1145, Hugh, son of Ralph Mortimer, conquered Malienydd and Elvael the\r\nsecond time.[906] These two districts properly belong to Powys, though\r\ngeographically in South Wales.\r\n\r\nWe leave to the last the conquest of Glamorgan, which may possibly have\r\nbeen one of the earliest, but whose date is still a matter of dispute,\r\nowing to the legendary nature of the Aberpergwm version of the _Brut_,\r\nthe only one which even alludes to this conquest. We have, however, an\r\ninitial date given us in the year 1082, when the _Brut y Tywysogion_\r\ntell us of the building of Cardiff Castle.[907] The conquest of\r\n\"Morgannwg,\" that is the country between the Usk and the Neath, was the\r\nmost permanent of any of those accomplished by the Normans in Wales,\r\nbut its details are the most obscure of any. The earlier version of\r\nthe _Brut_ takes no notice of the conquest of Glamorgan; the later\r\nversion which goes by the name of the _Gwentian Chronicle_[908] tells\r\nus that the Norman Robert Fitz Hamon, being called in to the help of\r\none Welsh prince against another, conquered Glamorgan for himself,\r\nand divided it amongst his followers, who built castles in all parts\r\nof the country. The date given is 1088. It seems to be agreed by\r\nhistorians that while the facts of Robert Fitz Hamon's existence and\r\nof his conquest of Glamorgan are certain, the details and the list of\r\nfollowers given in this chronicle are quite untrustworthy.[909]\r\n\r\nThe district called Gower did not then form part of Glamorgan, as it\r\ndoes now, though it is still ecclesiastically separate. If we are to\r\nbelieve the Aberpergwm _Brut_, it must have been conquered in 1094,\r\nwhen William de Londres, one of the \"knights\" of Robert Fitz Hamon,\r\nbuilt a strong castle in Cydweli (Kidwelly).[910]\r\n\r\nWe will now briefly notice such of the castles of these various\r\ndistricts as are mentioned in the sources to which we have already\r\nreferred in our last chapter, taking them in the order of the modern\r\ncounties in which they are found.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLES OF PEMBROKESHIRE.\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE.--Giraldus says that Arnulf de Montgomeri first built this\r\ncastle of sods and wattles, a scanty and slender construction, in the\r\nreign of Henry I.[911] This date, however, must certainly be wrong,\r\nfor the castle sustained a siege from the Welsh in 1094, and in 1098\r\nArnulf gave the chapel of St Nicholas in his castle of Pembroke to the\r\nabbey of St Martin at Sées.[912] There is no motte at Pembroke Castle;\r\nthe magnificent keep (clearly of the 13th century or later) stands\r\nin a small ward at the edge of a cliff,[913] separated by a former\r\nditch from the immense encircling bailey whose walls and towers are\r\nclearly of Edwardian date. The words of Giraldus \"a castle of wattles\r\nand turf\" might lead us to think that the first castle was a motte of\r\nthe usual type, but the use which he makes of the same expression in\r\nhis work on Ireland leads one to think that he means a less defensible\r\nfort, a mere bank and fence.[914] There is some reason, moreover, to\r\ndoubt whether the present castle of Pembroke stands on the same site\r\nas Arnulf's, as after the banishment of the latter, Gerald, the royal\r\nSeneschal of Pembroke \"built the castle anew in the place called Little\r\nCengarth.\"[915]\r\n\r\nBut however this may be, the castle of Pembroke was certainly strong\r\nenough in 1094 to resist a great insurrection of the Welsh, when all\r\nthe castles of south-west Wales were destroyed, except Pembroke and\r\nRhyd y Gors. And it continued to be one of the chief strongholds of\r\nEnglish power in South Wales until Edward I. completed the conquest of\r\nthe country. Its splendid situation on a high cliff at the mouth of an\r\nexcellent harbour, to which supplies could be brought by sea, was one\r\nof the secrets of its strength. A passage cut in the rock led from the\r\ncastle to a cave below opening on to the water.\r\n\r\n*NEWPORT, or Trefdaeth, was the head of the Barony of Keymes, an\r\nindependent lordship founded at the time of the first Norman advance,\r\nby Martin of Tours.[916] There is no mention of it before 1215. The\r\npresent ruined castle of Newport is not earlier than the 13th century,\r\nbut about 1-1/2 miles higher up the river, at Llanhyfer, is a fine\r\nmotte and bailey, which probably mark the site of the first castle of\r\nMartin of Tours.[917]\r\n\r\nWISTON, _alias_ Gwys or Wiz.--First mentioned in 1148, when it was\r\ntaken by the Welsh.[918] At a later period we find it one of the\r\ncastles of the Earl of Pembroke. There is a motte still remaining,\r\nwith a shell wall on top, 6 feet thick, having a plain round arched\r\nentrance. This masonry is probably the work of William Marshall, Earl\r\nof Pembroke, as he restored the castle in 1220 after it had been razed\r\nto the ground by Llywelyn ap Jorwerth.[919] The bailey is large and\r\nbean-shaped.\r\n\r\nLAWHADEN, or Llanyhadein, or Lauwadein.--First mention in 1192.[920]\r\nIt afterwards became a palace of the bishops of St David's. There is no\r\nmotte, though the circular outline of the platform on which the fine\r\nruins of the castle stand, very much suggests a lowered motte.\r\n\r\nHAVERFORDWEST.--First mentioned in the _Pipe Roll_ of 1214-1215, when\r\nit was in the custody of the Earl of Pembroke. Although this castle is\r\nnow a gaol, and the whole site masked with gaol buildings, the motte\r\ncan still be seen distinctly from one side, though the keep which\r\nstands upon it is blocked by buildings. The ditch which went round the\r\nmotte can also be traced. [H. W.]\r\n\r\nNARBERTH.--This castle is first mentioned in 1115, when it was burnt\r\nby the Welsh. Said to have been the castle of Stephen Perrot.[921] The\r\npresent ruins are entirely of the 13th century, and there is no motte;\r\nbut Lewis states that the first castle was in another site, between the\r\npresent town and Templeton; about which we have no information.\r\n\r\nTENBY.--First mention in 1152. An important coast station. The small\r\nand curious round keep is placed on the highest point of a small\r\nisland; it is a miniature copy of the keep of Pembroke, and was\r\nprobably built by one of the earls Marshall, not earlier than the 13th\r\ncentury. There is no motte, nor was one needed in such a situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLES OF CARDIGAN.\r\n\r\nCARDIGAN Castle, or Aberteifi, has been so much transformed by the\r\nincorporation of the keep into a modern house that nothing decisive can\r\nbe said about its original plan, but there is nothing to foreclose\r\nthe idea of a previous motte, and Speed's plan of 1611 seems to show\r\nthat the keep and the small ward attached to it were on a higher\r\nelevation than the bailey. That the first castle was a wooden one is\r\nrendered almost certain by the fact that Rhys ap Griffith, after having\r\ndemolished the previous castle, rebuilt it _with stone and mortar_,\r\nin the reign of Henry II.[922] The Welsh chronicler speaks of this\r\ncastle as the key of all Wales, an exaggeration certainly, but it was\r\nundoubtedly the most important stronghold of South Ceredigion. [H. W.]\r\n\r\nCILGERRAN, or Dingeraint (Fig. 41).--This castle was certainly built\r\nby Earl Roger;[923] a castle of great importance, in a magnificent\r\nsituation. Like nearly all the castles in our Welsh list, it was\r\nrepeatedly taken by the Welsh and retaken from them. The present\r\nmasonry is of the 13th century, but the original motte-and-bailey plan\r\nis quite discernible. [H. W.] It was a connecting link between the\r\ncastles of Pembrokeshire and those of Cardigan, and stands near a road\r\nleading directly from Tenby and Narberth to Cardigan.\r\n\r\nABERYSTWYTH, also Lampadarn Vaur, also Aberrheiddiol.[924] In 1109\r\nHenry I. deposed Cadwgan, a Welsh prince who had purchased from the\r\nking the government of Cardigan, and gave that country to Gilbert, son\r\nof Richard, Earl of Clare, who took possession, and built a castle\r\n\"opposite to Llanbadarn, near the mouth of the river Ystwyth.\"[925]\r\nThis was undoubtedly the precursor of the modern castle of Aberystwyth,\r\nbut it is doubtful whether it was on the same site; the present ruins\r\nare not opposite Llanbadarn. The castle was as important for the\r\ndefence of N. Cardigan as Cardigan Castle for the south. It was taken\r\nat least seven times by the Welsh, and burnt at least five times. The\r\npresent ruins are not earlier than the time of Edward I., and there is\r\nno motte or keep. [H. W.]\r\n\r\n*BLAENPORTH, or Castell Gwythan (Fig. 41).--Also built by Gilbert de\r\nClare, and evidently placed to defend the main road from Cardigan to\r\nAberystwyth. The motte and bailey are still remarkably perfect, as\r\nshown by the 25-inch Ordnance Map.\r\n\r\nYSTRAD PEITHYLL.--Another of Gilbert de Clare's castles, as it was\r\ninhabited by his steward. It was burnt by the Welsh in 1115,[926] and\r\nis never mentioned again, but its motte and ditch still survive, with\r\nsome signs of a bailey, close to the little stream of the Peithyll,\r\nnear Aberystwyth. [H. W.]\r\n\r\nCHASTELL GWALTER, or Llanfihangel, in Pengwern (Fig. 41).--Castle of\r\nWalter de Bec, probably one of the barons of Gilbert de Clare. First\r\nmentioned in 1137, when it was burned by the Welsh.[927] There is a\r\nsmall but well-made motte and part of an adjoining bailey standing in a\r\nmost commanding position on a high plateau. The ditch of the motte is\r\nexcavated in the rock. [D. H. M.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--MOTTE-CASTLES OF SOUTH WALES. Cilgerran.\r\nBlaenporth. Chastell Gwalter.]\r\n\r\n*DINERTH.--Also burnt in 1137; restored by Roger, Earl of Clare,\r\nin 1159, after which it underwent many vicissitudes.[928] Probably\r\noriginally a castle of the Clares. \"In the grounds of Mynachty, in\r\nthe parish of Llanbadarn Tref Eglwys, is a small hill called Hero\r\nCastell, probably the site of the keep of Dinerth Castle.\"[929] The\r\nO.M. shows a small motte and bailey placed between two streams.\r\n\r\n*CAERWEDROS, or Castell Llwyndafydd, also burned by the Welsh in\r\n1137,[930] after which it is not mentioned again. \"A very large moated\r\ntumulus, with foundations of walls on the top.\"[931] Probably a Clare\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\n*HUMPHREY'S CASTLE, now Castle Howel, from one of its Welsh conquerors.\r\nThe original name shows that it was built by a Norman, and it was\r\nrestored by Roger, Earl of Clare, in 1159.[932] A moated tumulus near\r\nthe river Clettwr marks the site of Humphrey's Castle.[933]\r\n\r\nYSTRAD MEURUG, or Meyric, at the head of the valley of the Teifi,\r\nand commanding the pass leading over into Radnorshire.--Built by\r\nGilbert de Clare when he reconquered Cardigan, and one of his most\r\nimportant castles.[934] Its importance is shown by the fact that it\r\nhad a small stone keep, the date of which cannot now be determined,\r\nas only the foundations remain, buried under sods. There is no motte,\r\nand the bailey can only be guessed at by a portion of the ditch which\r\nstill remains on the N. side, and by two platforms which appear to be\r\nartificially levelled. The castle is about three miles from the Sarn\r\nHelen or Roman road through Cardigan.\r\n\r\n*PONT Y STUFFAN, or Stephen's Bridge, near Lampeter.--Burnt by the\r\nWelsh in 1138, and not again mentioned.[935] In the outskirts of\r\nthe town of Lampeter is--or was--a lofty moated tumulus (not shown\r\non O.M.), and traces of a quadrangular court.[936] As it is also\r\ncalled Castell Ystuffan, it was probably built by Stephen, the Norman\r\nconstable of Cardigan. There appears to be another castle mound at\r\nLampeter itself, near the church. Lampeter was an important post on the\r\nRoman road up the valley of the Teifi.\r\n\r\n*NANT YR ARIAN.--This castle is only mentioned once, in the partition\r\nof Cardigan and Pembroke which took place in 1216, during the most\r\ndisastrous part of John's reign.[937] There are two \"castellau\" marked\r\nat Nant yr Arian in the N. of Cardiganshire in the O.M.; neither of\r\nthem look like mottes. This castle, as well as that of Ystrad Peithyll,\r\nseems to have been placed to defend the road from Aberystwyth to\r\nLlanidloes, which would be the chief highway between Shropshire and\r\nCeredigion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLES OF CARMARTHENSHIRE.\r\n\r\nRHYD Y GORS, or Rhyd Cors.--We have no hesitation in adopting the\r\nopinion of the late Mr Floyd, that this is another name for the castle\r\nof Carmarthen.[938] As it and Pembroke were the only castles which\r\nheld out during the great Welsh revolt of 1096,[939] it is evident\r\nthat they were the two strongest and best defended places, therefore\r\nthe most important. Carmarthen also was a Roman city, and its walls\r\nwere still standing in Giraldus' time;[940] it was therefore the place\r\nwhere one would expect to find a Norman castle. Now Carmarthen, along\r\nwith Cardiff and Pembroke, continued up till the final conquest of all\r\nWales to be the most important seat of English power in South Wales.\r\nMoreover, Rhyd y Gors was a royal castle; we are expressly told that\r\nit was built by William Fitz Baldwin, by the command of the king of\r\nEngland.[941] Carmarthen also was a royal castle, and the only one in\r\nSouth Wales at that date which belonged directly to the king. It was\r\ntemporarily abandoned after William Fitz Baldwin's death in 1096, and\r\nafterwards Henry I. gave it into the custody of a Welshman, who also\r\nhad charge of Strath Towy; a passage which proves that Rhyd y Gors was\r\nin that district. It was restored by Richard Fitz Baldwin in 1104,[942]\r\nand is mentioned for the last time in 1105. After that the castle of\r\nCarmarthen, which has not been mentioned before, begins to appear, and\r\nits importance is clear from the continual references to it. Placed\r\nas it is on a navigable river, at the entrance of the narrower part\r\nof the vale of Towy, and on the Roman road from Brecon to St David's,\r\nits natural position must have marked it as a fit site for a royal\r\ncastle. The castle is now converted into a gaol, and disfigured in the\r\nusual way; yet the ancient motte of William Fitz Baldwin still remains,\r\npartly inside and partly outside the walls. It is crowned with a stone\r\nrevetment which Colonel Morgan believes to have been erected at the\r\ntime of the Civil War, to form a platform for guns.[943] The bailey is\r\nrectangular and covers about 2 acres. The motte is placed at one corner\r\nof it, on the line of the walls. On the outside it is now built over\r\nwith poor cottages; but the site of the ditch can still be traced.\r\n\r\n*LLANDOVERY, or Llanymdyfri, or the castle of Cantrebohhan.--It is\r\nreferred to in the _Pipe Rolls_ of 1159-1160 by the latter name, which\r\nis only a Norman way of spelling Cantref Bychan, the little cantref\r\nor hundred, of which this castle was the head.[944] It was then in\r\nroyal custody, and Henry II. spent nearly £60 on its works. But it had\r\noriginally belonged to Richard Fitz Pons, one of the barons of Bernard\r\nde Neufmarché, and the fact that he held the key of this cantref goes\r\nto prove that it was from Brecknock that the Normans advanced into\r\nnorthern Carmarthenshire. The castle is first mentioned in the _Brut_\r\nin 1115, when Griffith ap Rhys burnt the bailey, but could not take\r\nthe keep on the motte.[945] It does not appear to have been long in\r\nEnglish hands after 1159, but its alternations were many. The 25-inch\r\nO.M. shows an oval motte, carrying some fragments of masonry, to which\r\nis attached a roughly quadrangular bailey. This was one of the many\r\ncastles by which the Normans held Strath Towy.\r\n\r\nLLANSTEPHAN.[946]--This castle stands in a splendid situation at\r\nthe mouth of the Towy, and was doubtless built to secure a maritime\r\nbase for Carmarthen. The motte is of unusual size, semicircular in\r\nshape, one side being on the edge of the cliff; it measures 300 feet\r\nby 200 in the centre of the arc.[947] Such a size allowed all the\r\nimportant parts of the castle to be built on the motte; but there was\r\na rectangular bailey attached, which is only imperfectly shown on the\r\nO.M.; the scarp is in reality well marked on all sides, and the ditch\r\nseparating it from the motte is a very deep one. [H. W.] The towers\r\nthat now crown the motte are not earlier than the year 1256, when the\r\ncastle was destroyed by Llywelyn.[948]\r\n\r\nDINEVOR, or Dinweiler.--Most Welsh writers associate Dinevor with the\r\nancient residence of the kings of South Wales, but there appears to\r\nbe some doubt about this, as the place is not mentioned before the\r\n12th century.[949] Anyhow the castle was certainly the work of Earl\r\nGilbert, as the _Brut_ itself tells us so.[950] In 1162 it was taken\r\nby Rhys ap Griffith, the able prince who attempted the consolidation\r\nof South Wales, and who was made Justiciar of that province by Henry\r\nII. It continued in Welsh hands, sometimes hostile, sometimes allied,\r\ntill it was finally taken by the English in 1277. The existing ruins\r\nare entirely of the 13th century, but the plan certainly suggests a\r\nprevious motte and bailey, the motte having probably been lowered to\r\nform the present smaller ward, whose walls and towers appear to be of\r\nEdward I.'s reign. The small bailey attached to this ward is separated\r\nfrom it by a ditch cut through the headland on which the castle stands.\r\n\r\nKIDWELLY (Cydweli).--This castle, though in Carmarthen, was not founded\r\nby the conquerors from Brecknock, but by Normans from Glamorgan or\r\nGower. Kidwelly was first built by William de Londres, in 1094.[951]\r\nThe present castle shows no trace of this early origin, but is a fine\r\nspecimen of the keepless pattern introduced into England in the 13th\r\ncentury.[952] There is no motte.\r\n\r\nLAUGHARNE, or Talycharne.--Also called Abercorran, being at the point\r\nwhere the little river Corran flows into the estuary of the Taff. In\r\n1113 this castle belonged to a Norman named Robert Courtmain.[953] The\r\nancient features of the plan have been obliterated by transformation\r\nfirst into an Edwardian castle, then into a modern house. There is of\r\ncourse no motte. [H. W.]\r\n\r\n*YSTRAD CYNGEN.--This must, we think, be the same as ST CLEARS, which\r\nstands in the Cynen valley, near its junction with the Taff. Welsh\r\nwriters identify St Clears with the castle of Mabudrud, the name of the\r\n_commot_ in which it stands. First mentioned in 1154.[954] There is no\r\nnotice of its origin, but the fact that a Cluniac priory existed in the\r\nvillage, which was a cell of St Martin des Champs at Paris, points to\r\na Norman founder, and renders an 11th century date probable. It was a\r\nmotte-and-bailey castle, of which the earthworks remain.[955]\r\n\r\n*NEWCASTLE EMLYN.--This castle does not appear to have received the\r\nname of \"the new castle of Emlyn\" till after Edward I.'s conquest.[956]\r\nThe new castle, which is quite Edwardian, was probably built on a\r\ndifferent site to the old, as \"on the other side of the bridge is a\r\nconsiderable mount, of a military character, which must have commanded\r\nthe river. It may have been the original strong post occupied by the\r\nNormans.\"[957] In the 12th century _Pipe Rolls_ compensation is paid\r\nto William FitzGerald for many years \"as long as Rhys ap Griffith\r\nholds the castle of Emlyn,\" which points to Gerald, the Seneschal of\r\nPembroke, or his family, as its founders. It is on the very border\r\nof Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, defending the main road from\r\nCarmarthen to Cardigan.\r\n\r\nLLANEGWAD.--This castle is only once mentioned, in the _Brut_, under\r\nthe year 1203, when it was taken by the Welsh. A small motte, called\r\nlocally Pen y Knap, with an earthen breastwork round the top, is still\r\nstanding about a mile from the church of Llanegwad, and is all that is\r\nleft of this castle. The position commands a fine view over the Towy\r\nvalley, and it is noteworthy that it stands very near the supposed\r\nRoman road from Brecon to Carmarthen. [H. W.]\r\n\r\n*LLANGADOG.--This castle also does not appear till 1203; it was razed\r\nor burnt at least thrice in five years.[958] A mound of earth on the\r\nbanks of the Sawddwy River, near where the Roman road from Brecon is\r\nsupposed to have reached the Towy valley, is all that remains of\r\nit.[959] Lewis says that it stands in a large oval entrenchment, and\r\nthat the motte is of natural rock, scarped conically, and deeply moated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLES IN BRECKNOCKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nBRECON, or Aberhonddu, the seat of Bernard de Neufmarché himself.--A\r\ncharter of Bernard's mentions the castle.[960] It seems to have been a\r\nparticularly strong place, as we do not hear of its having been burnt\r\nmore than once. The newer castle of Brecon is evidently of the time\r\nof Edward I., but across the road the old motte of Bernard is still\r\nstanding, and carries the ruins of a shell wall, with a gatehouse\r\ntower.[961] A portion of the bank and ditch of the bailey remains;\r\nthe whole is now in a private garden. The situation is a strong one,\r\nbetween the Usk and the Honddu. Brecon of course was a burgus, and part\r\nof the bank which fortified it remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--MOTTE-CASTLES OF SOUTH WALES. Builth. Gemaron.\r\nPayn's Castle.]\r\n\r\nBUILTH, on the upper Wye, _alias_ Buallt (Fig. 42).--A remarkably\r\nfine motte and bailey, presenting some peculiarities of plan. It\r\nis not mentioned till 1210,[962] but it has been conjectured with\r\ngreat probability that it was one of the castles built by Bernard de\r\nNeufmarché when he conquered Brecknock.[963] It was refortified by\r\nJohn Mortimer in 1242,[964] probably in stone, as in the account of its\r\ndestruction by Llywelyn in 1260 it is said that \"not one stone was left\r\non another.\"[965] Nevertheless when Edward I. rebuilt it the towers on\r\nthe outer wall appear to have been of wood.[966] Mr Clark states that\r\nthere are traces of masonry foundations and small portions of a wing\r\nwall. The bailey of this castle consists of a rather narrow platform,\r\ndivided into two unequal portions by a cross ditch which connects the\r\nditch of the motte with that of the bailey. The ditch round the motte\r\nis of unusual breadth, being 120 feet broad in the widest part. The\r\nwhole work is encircled by an outer ditch of varying breadth, being 100\r\nfeet wide on the weakest side of the work, and by a counterscarp bank\r\nwhich appears to be still perfect. The entrance is defended by four\r\nsmall mounds which probably cover the remains of towers.[967] The area\r\nof the two baileys together is only 1 acre. [D. H. M.]\r\n\r\n*HAY, or Tregelli.--The earliest mention of this castle is in a charter\r\nof Henry I.[968] The present castle of Hay is of late date, but Leland\r\ntells us that \"not far from the Paroche Chirch is a great round Hille\r\nof Yerth cast up by Men's Hondes.\"[969] It is shown on the 25-inch\r\nO.M., and so is the line of the borough walls.\r\n\r\n*TALGARTH.--Mentioned in a charter of Roger, Earl of Hereford, not\r\nlater than 1156.[970] A 13th-century tower on a small motte is still\r\nstanding, and can be seen from the railway between Brecon and Hereford.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLES OF RADNORSHIRE.\r\n\r\n*RADNOR, or Maes Hyvaidd.--Though this castle is not mentioned in\r\nthe _Brut_ till 1196, when it was burnt by Rhys ap Griffith, it must\r\nhave been built by the Normans at a very early period. The English\r\nhad penetrated into the Radnor district even before the Norman\r\nConquest,[971] and the Normans were not slow to follow them. A charter\r\nof Philip de Braose is granted at \"Raddenoam\" not later than 1096.[972]\r\nThere are mottes both at Old and New Radnor, towns three miles distant\r\nfrom each other, so that it is impossible to say which was the Maes\r\nHyvaidd of the _Brut_. Both may have been originally De Braose castles,\r\nbut New Radnor evidently became the more important place, and has\r\nmassive remains in masonry. The town was a _burgus_.\r\n\r\n*GEMARON, or Cwm Aron (Fig. 42).--Near Llandewi-Ystrad-denny. The\r\n_Brut_ mentions its repair by Hugh Mortimer in 1145.[973] The 6-inch\r\nO.M. shows a square central bailey of 1 acre, containing some remains\r\nof masonry, lying between an oblong motte in the S. and an outer\r\nenclosure on the N., the whole being further defended by a high\r\ncounterscarp bank on the W. It commands a ford over the river Aran.\r\nThere is no village attached to it.\r\n\r\n*MAUD'S CASTLE, otherwise Colwyn or Clun.[974]--A ditched motte with\r\nsquare bailey on the left bank of the river Edwy, near the village of\r\nForest Colwyn. The statement that this castle was _repaired_ in 1145\r\nshows that it must have been older than the time of Maude de Braose,\r\nfrom whom it is generally supposed to have taken its name. It was\r\nrebuilt by Henry III. in 1231.[975]\r\n\r\n*PAYN'S CASTLE, otherwise \"the castle of Elvael.\"--First mentioned\r\nin 1196, when it was taken by Rhys ap Griffith. This is also a\r\nmotte-castle (and an exceptionally fine one), placed on a road leading\r\nfrom Kington in Hereford to Builth. Rebuilt _in stone_ by Henry III. in\r\n1231.[976] (Fig. 42.)\r\n\r\n*KNIGHTON, in Welsh Trefclawdd.--First mentioned in the _Pipe Roll_ of\r\n1181. The motte still remains, near the church. There is another motte\r\njust outside the village, called Bryn y Castell. It may be a siege\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\n*NORTON.--First mentioned in the _Pipe Roll_ of 1191. A motte remains\r\nclose to the church, and two sides of a bailey which ran down to the\r\nNorton brook.\r\n\r\n*BLEDDFA, the Bledewach of the _Pipe Roll_ of 1195-1196, when £5 was\r\ngiven to Hugh de Saye _ad firmandum castellum_, an expression which\r\nmay mean either building or repairing. An oval motte, and traces of a\r\nbailey, are marked in the 6-inch O.M.\r\n\r\nTYNBOETH, _alias_ Dyneneboth, Tinbech,[977] and Llananno.--First\r\nmentioned in _Pipe Roll_ of 1196-1197. There is a fine large motte\r\nin a commanding situation, and a crescent-shaped bailey, now marked\r\nonly by a scarp. There are some remains of masonry, and the castle was\r\nevidently an important one. It is first mentioned in the _Pipe Roll_\r\nof 1196, and it occurs in lists of the Mortimer castles in the 14th\r\ncentury.[978] It is not far from two fords of the river Ithon. [H. W.]\r\n\r\nThese four castles are not mentioned in the _Brut y Tywysogion_, though\r\nthe _Annales Cambriæ_ mentions the capture of Bleddfa, Knighton, and\r\nNorton by the Welsh in 1262. They all command important roads. Knighton\r\nand Norton were boroughs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--MOTTE-CASTLES OF SOUTH WALES. Cardiff.\r\nLoughor.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLES OF GLAMORGANSHIRE.\r\n\r\n_Cardiff_ (Fig. 43).--The first castle of Cardiff was certainly a\r\nwooden one; its lofty mound still remains. It is placed inside a\r\nRoman station, and the south and west walls of the castle bailey\r\nrest on Roman foundations, \"but do not entirely coincide with those\r\nfoundations.\"[979] The Roman fort was probably ruinous when Robert Fitz\r\nHamon placed his first castle there, as on the N. and E. sides the\r\nbailey is defended by an earthbank, in which the remains of a Roman\r\nwall have been found buried. The area of the Roman Castrum was about\r\n8-1/4 acres, and evidently the Normans found this too large, as they\r\ndivided it by a cross wall, which reduces the inner fort to about 2\r\nacres. The motte has its own ditch. The position of Cardiff was a very\r\nimportant base, not only as a port near Bristol, but as a point on\r\nthe probably Roman road which connected Gloucester with Carmarthen and\r\nbeyond.[980]\r\n\r\nThe lands of Robert Fitz Hamon, in the next generation, passed into the\r\nhands of Robert, the great Earl of Gloucester, Henry I.'s illegitimate\r\nson. He was a great castle-builder, and it is probable that the first\r\nmasonry of Cardiff Castle was his work.[981]\r\n\r\nNEWCASTLE BRIDGEND.--This castle and the three which follow are all\r\nsituated on or near the \"Roman\" road from Cardiff to St David's, of\r\nwhich we have already spoken. There were two castles at Bridgend, the\r\nOld Castle and the New Castle, from which the town takes its name. The\r\nsite of the former is now too much cut up for any definite conclusions\r\nabout it; the site of the latter has been converted into market\r\ngardens, but a motte is still standing in one corner with the ruins\r\nof a tower upon it. [H. W.] This castle is not noticed either by the\r\n_Brut_ or the Aberpergwm version; the earliest mention known to us is\r\nin the _Pipe Roll_ of 1184, at a time when the castles of the Earl of\r\nGloucester were in royal custody, and this appears to have been one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nKENFIG.--This castle is close to the \"Roman\" road. The Aberpergwm\r\n_Brut_ says that it was one of the castles of Robert Fitz Hamon, and\r\nstates that in 1092 it was rebuilt \"stronger than ever before, for\r\ncastles prior to that were built of wood.\" This is a good specimen\r\nof the mixture of truth and error to be found in this 16th century\r\nMS. There is little doubt that all the first castles of the Normans\r\nin Wales were built of wood; but it is extremely unlikely that any\r\nwooden keep was replaced by a stone one as early as 1092. The town and\r\ncastle of Kenfig are now almost entirely buried in sand-drifts, but\r\nthe top of the motte, with some fragments of masonry upon it, is still\r\nvisible. [H. W.][982] The note in the _Pipe Rolls_ of the repair of the\r\n_palicium_ of this castle shows that the bailey wall at any rate was\r\nstill of wood in 1183. Even as late as 1232 the keep was only defended\r\nby a ditch and hedge; yet it withstood an assault from Llywelyn ap\r\nJorwerth.[983] The bailey is said to contain 11 acres, a most unusual\r\nsize. Kenfig was a borough in Norman times, and it is possible that\r\nthis large bailey was the original borough, afterwards enlarged in\r\nmediæval times. There is evidence that there were burgage tenements\r\nwithin the bailey.[984]\r\n\r\nABERAVON.--The Aberpergwm MS. says that Fitz Hamon gave Aberavon to the\r\nson of the Welsh traitor who had called him into Glamorgan. At a later\r\nperiod, however, we find it in Norman hands. The site of the castle\r\nhas been entirely cleared away, but it had a motte, which is still\r\nremembered by the older inhabitants. [H. W.][985] It is not mentioned\r\nin the _Brut_ before 1152, when it was attacked and burnt by Rhys ap\r\nGriffith.\r\n\r\n*NEATH.--The site of the first castle of Neath was given by Richard de\r\nGranville, its owner, to the abbey of Neath, which he had founded.[986]\r\nAbout the year 1111, according to the Aberpergwm _Brut_, Richard\r\nreturned from the Holy Land, bringing with him a Syrian architect, well\r\nskilled in the building of monasteries, churches, and castles, and by\r\nhim we may presume, a new castle was built on the other side of the\r\nriver, though the present castle on that site is clearly of much later\r\ndate. The monks of course destroyed all vestiges of the first (probably\r\nwooden) castle.\r\n\r\n*REMMI, or Remni.--Of this castle there is only one solitary mention,\r\nin the _Pipe Roll_ of 1184. The name seems to indicate the river\r\nRhymney, which is the boundary between Glamorgan and Monmouth. We\r\nare unable to find any castle site so near the Rhymney as Ruperra,\r\nwhere Clark mentions a fine motte.[987] But we do not venture on this\r\nidentification without further information.[988]\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLES OF GOWER.\r\n\r\n*SWANSEA, or Abertawy.--This was the castle of Henry Beaumont, the\r\nconqueror of Gower. The present castle is comparatively modern. It is\r\ninside the town; but there used to be a moated mound outside the town,\r\nwhich was only removed in 1804. It seems probable to us that this was\r\nthe original castle of Beaumont.[989] That this first castle had a\r\nmotte is suggested by the narrative in the _Brut_ which tells how\r\nGriffith ap Rhys burnt the outworks in 1115, but was unable to get at\r\nthe tower.[990]\r\n\r\n*LOUGHOR, or Aberllychor (Fig. 43).--Also built by Henry Beaumont.\r\nThe mound of the castle still remains, with a small square keep on\r\ntop. There was formerly a shell wall also. The place of a bailey\r\nwas supplied by a terrace 15 feet wide.[991] The four castles last\r\nmentioned are all at the mouths of rivers, as well as on an ancient (if\r\nnot Roman) coast road.\r\n\r\n*LLANDEILO TALYBONT, or Castell Hu.--Only mentioned once in the _Brut_,\r\nunder 1215, as the castle of Hugh de Miles. A moated mound with a\r\nsquare bailey and no masonry still remains.[992] It commands the river\r\nLoughor, which is still navigable up to that point at high tides.[993]\r\nOn the opposite side of the river is another motte and bailey, called\r\nYstum Enlle. Possibly there was a ford or ferry at this point, which\r\nthese castles were placed to defend.[994]\r\n\r\nOYSTERMOUTH, a corruption of Ystum Llwynarth.--First mentioned in the\r\nolder _Brut_ in 1215, when it was burnt by Rhys Grug. The later version\r\nsays it was built by Beaumont in 1099. The castle stands on a natural\r\nheight, fortified artificially by a motte, which is of great size.\r\nThere is a small bailey below to the N.E., and a curious small oval\r\nembankment thrown out in the rear of the castle towards the N.W. The\r\narchitecture of this magnificent castle is all of the Edwardian style,\r\nand as the castle was burnt down by Rhys ap Meredith in 1287, it is\r\nprobable that only wooden structures stood on this site until after\r\nthat date. The castle is in a fine situation overlooking the Bay of\r\nSwansea. [H. W.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now completed our list of the Norman castles built in Wales\r\nwhich are known to history. It must not be supposed, however, that we\r\nimagine this to be a complete list of all the Norman castles which\r\nwere ever erected in Wales. The fact that several in our catalogue are\r\nonly once mentioned in the records makes it probable that there were\r\nmany others which have never been mentioned at all. In this way we may\r\naccount for the many mottes which remain in Wales about which history\r\nis entirely silent. As there was scarcely a corner in Wales into\r\nwhich the Normans did not penetrate at some time or other, it is not\r\nsurprising if we find them in districts which are generally reckoned\r\nto be entirely Welsh. But there is another way of accounting for them;\r\nsome of them may have been built by the Welsh themselves, in imitation\r\nof the Normans. As the feudal system and feudal ideas penetrated more\r\nand more into Wales, and the Welsh princes themselves became feudal\r\nhomagers of the kings of England, it was natural that the feudal castle\r\nshould also become a Welsh institution, especially as it was soon\r\nfound to be a great addition to the chieftain's personal strength. The\r\nfollowing castles are stated in the _Brut_ to have been built by the\r\nWelsh.[995]\r\n\r\n1113. *CYMMER, in Merioneth.--Built by Uchtred ap Edwin, whose name,\r\nas we have already remarked, suggests an English descent. Near Cymmer\r\nAbbey the motte or _tomen_ remains.\r\n\r\n*CYNFAEL, in Merioneth, near Towyn.--Built by Cadwalader, son of\r\nGriffith ap Cynan, on whose behalf Henry II. undertook his first\r\nexpedition into Wales, and who was at that time a protégé of the\r\nAnglo-Normans. Clark gives a plan of this motte-castle in _Arch.\r\nCamb._, 4th ser., vi., 66.\r\n\r\n1148. *YALE, in Denbigh = Llanarmon.--Said to have been built by Owen\r\nGwynedd, but here, as we have said, an earlier Norman foundation seems\r\nprobable (see p. 272).\r\n\r\n1148. LLANRHYSTYD, in Cardigan.--Also built by Cadwalader, who was then\r\nestablishing himself in Cardigan. Probably the motte and bailey called\r\nPenrhos, or Castell Rhos, to the east of Llanrhystyd village. [H. W.]\r\n\r\n1155. ABERDOVEY.--Built by Rhys ap Griffith to defend Cardigan against\r\nOwen, Prince of Gwynedd. It must therefore have been on the Cardigan\r\nshore of the Dovey, and not at the present town of Aberdovey, which\r\nis on the Merioneth shore. And in fact, on the Cardigan shore of the\r\nestuary, about two miles west of Glandovey Castle, there is a tumulus\r\ncalled Domenlas (the green tump), which was very likely the site of\r\nthis castle of Rhys.[996]\r\n\r\n1155. CAEREINION.--Built by Madoc of Powys, who was then a homager of\r\nHenry II. Remains of a motte near the church; the churchyard itself\r\nappears to be the former bailey. About a mile off is a British camp\r\ncalled Pen y Voel, which _may_ have been the seat of the son of\r\nCunedda, who is said to have settled here. [H. W.]\r\n\r\n*WALWERN, or Tafolwern, near Llanbrynmair, in Montgomery, may have been\r\na Welsh castle. It is first mentioned in 1163, when Howel ap Jeuav\r\ntook it from Owen Gwynedd, who may have been its builder. The motte is\r\nmarked in the O.M. on a narrow peninsula at the junction of two streams.\r\n\r\n1169. *ABEREINON, in Cardigan.--Built by Rhys ap Griffith, Henry II.'s\r\nJusticiar of South Wales. \"A circular moated tumulus, now called Cil y\r\nCraig.\"[997] (It is marked on the 25-inch O.M.)\r\n\r\n1177. *RHAIDR GWY.--Also built by Rhys ap Griffith, no doubt as a\r\nmenace to Powys, as this castle was afterwards sorely contested. It is\r\na motte-and-bailey castle, the motte being known as Tower Mount.[998]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll these castles are of the motte-and-bailey type, and prove the\r\nadoption by the Welsh of Norman customs.[999] It will be noticed that\r\nin the first instances they were built by men who were specially under\r\nNorman influences. But probably the fashion was soon more widely\r\nfollowed, although these are the only recorded cases.\r\n\r\nThe contribution made by the castles of Wales to the general theory\r\nof the origin of mottes in these islands is very important. Leaving\r\nout the seven castles attributed to the Welsh, we find that out of\r\nseventy-one castles built by the Normans, fifty-three, or very nearly\r\nthree-fourths, still have mottes; while in the remaining eighteen,\r\neither the sites have been so altered as to destroy the original plan,\r\nor there is a probability that a motte has formerly existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMOTTE-CASTLES IN SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scottish historians of the 19th century have amply recognised the\r\nAnglo-Norman occupation of Scotland, which took place in the 11th and\r\n12th centuries, ever since its extent and importance were demonstrated\r\nby Chalmers in his _Caledonia_. Occupation is not too strong a word to\r\nuse, although it was an occupation about which history is strangely\r\nsilent, and which seems to have provoked little resistance except in\r\nthe Keltic parts of the country. But it meant the transformation of\r\nScotland from a tribal Keltic kingdom into an organised feudal state,\r\nand in the accomplishment of this transformation the greater part of\r\nthe best lands in Scotland passed into the hands of English refugees or\r\nNorman and Flemish adventurers.\r\n\r\nThe movement began in the days of Malcolm Canmore, when his English\r\nqueen, the sainted Margaret, undoubtedly favoured the reception\r\nof English refugees of noble birth, some of whom were her own\r\nrelations.[1000] Very soon, the English refugees were followed by\r\nNorman refugees, who had either fallen under the displeasure of the\r\nking of England, like the Montgomeries, or were the cadets of some\r\nNorman family, wishful to carve out fresh fortunes for themselves, like\r\nthe Fitz Alans, the ancestors of the Stuarts. The immigration continued\r\nduring the reign of the sons of Margaret, but seems to have reached its\r\nculminating point under David I. (1124-1153).\r\n\r\nDavid, as Burton remarks, had lived for sixteen years as an affluent\r\nAnglo-Norman noble, before his accession to the Scottish crown, being\r\nEarl of Huntingdon in right of his wife, the daughter of Simon de\r\nSenlis, and granddaughter, through her mother, of Earl Waltheof.\r\nDavid's tastes and sympathies were Norman, but it was not taste\r\nalone which impelled him to build up in Scotland a monarchy of the\r\nAnglo-Norman feudal type. He had a distinct policy to accomplish; he\r\nwished to do for Scotland what Edward I. sought to do for the whole\r\nisland, to unite its various nationalities under one government, and\r\nhe saw that men of the Anglo-Norman type would be the best instruments\r\nof this policy.[1001] It mattered little to him from what nation he\r\nchose his followers, if they were men who accepted his ideas. Norman,\r\nEnglish, Flemish, or Norse adventurers were all received at his\r\ncourt, and endowed with lands in Scotland, if they were men suitable\r\nfor working the system which he knew to be the only one available\r\nfor the accomplishment of his policy. And that system was the feudal\r\nsystem. He saw that feudalism meant a higher state of civilisation\r\nthan the tribalism of Keltic Scotland, and that only by the complete\r\norganisation of feudalism could he carry out the unification of\r\nScotland, and the subjugation of the wild Keltic tribes of the north\r\nand west.[1002]\r\n\r\nThe policy was successful, though it was not completely carried out\r\nuntil Alexander III. purchased the kingdom of the Isles from the King\r\nof Norway in 1266. The sons of David, Malcolm IV., and William the Lion\r\nwere strong men who doughtily continued the subjugation of the Keltic\r\nparts of Scotland, and distributed the lands of the conquered among\r\ntheir Norman or Normanised followers. The struggle was a severe one;\r\nagain and again did the North rebel against the yoke of the House of\r\nMalcolm. In Moray the Keltic inhabitants were actually driven out by\r\nMalcolm IV., and the country colonised by Normans or Flemings.[1003]\r\nThe same Malcolm led no less than three expeditions against Galloway,\r\nwhere in spite of extensive Norse settlements on the coast, the mass of\r\nthe inhabitants appear to have been Keltic.[1004]\r\n\r\nWe know very little about the details of this remarkable revolution,\r\nbecause Scotland had no voice in the 12th century, none of her\r\nchroniclers being earlier than the end of the 14th century. As regards\r\nthe subject which concerns this book, the building of castles, there\r\nare only one or two passages which lift the veil. A contemporary\r\nEnglish chronicler, Ailred of Rievaulx, in his panegyric of David I.,\r\nsays that David decorated Scotland with castles and cities.[1005] In\r\nlike manner Benedict of Peterborough tells us that when William the\r\nLion was captured by Henry II.'s forces in 1174, the men of Galloway\r\ntook the opportunity to destroy all the castles which the king had\r\nbuilt in their country, expelling his seneschals and guards, and\r\nkilling all the English and French whom they could catch.[1006] Fordun\r\ncasually mentions the building of two castles in Ross by William the\r\nLion; and once he gives us an anecdote which is a chance revelation\r\nof what must have been going on everywhere. A certain English knight,\r\nRobert, son of Godwin, whose Norman name shows that he was one of the\r\nNormanised English, tarried with the king's leave on an estate which\r\nKing Edgar had given him in Lothian, _and while he was seeking to build\r\na castle there_, he was attacked by the men of Bishop Ranulf of Durham,\r\nwho objected to a castle being built so near the English frontier.[1007]\r\n\r\nBut even if historians had been entirely silent about the building of\r\ncastles in Scotland, we should have been certain that it must have\r\nhappened, as an inevitable part of the Norman settlement. Robertson\r\nremarks that the Scots in the time of David I. were still a pastoral\r\nand in some respects a migratory people, their magnates not residing\r\nlike great feudal nobles in their own castles, but moving about\r\nfrom place to place, and quartering themselves upon the dependent\r\npopulation. There is in fact no reason for supposing that the Keltic\r\nchiefs of Scotland built castles, any more than those of Wales or\r\nIreland.[1008] But the feudal system must very soon have covered\r\nScotland with castles.\r\n\r\nThe absence of any stone castles of Norman type has puzzled Scottish\r\nhistorians, whose ideas of castles were associated with buildings in\r\nstone.[1009] In 1898 Dr Christison published his valuable researches\r\ninto the _Early Fortifications of Scotland_, in which for the first\r\ntime an estimate was attempted of the distribution of Scottish\r\n_motes_,[1010] and their Norman origin almost, if not quite, suspected.\r\nHis book was quickly followed by Mr George Neilson's noteworthy paper\r\non the \"Motes in Norman Scotland,\"[1011] in which he showed that the\r\nwooden castle is the key which unlocks the historians' puzzle, and that\r\nthe motes of Scotland are nothing but the evidence of the Norman feudal\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nTwo important points urged in Mr Neilson's paper are the feudal and\r\nlegal connection of these motes. He has given a list of mottes which\r\nare known to have been the site of the \"chief messuages\" of baronies\r\nin the 13th and 14th centuries, and has collected the names of a great\r\nnumber which were seats of justice, or places where \"saisine\" of a\r\nbarony was taken, not because they were moot-hills, but because the\r\nadministration of justice remained fixed in the ancient site of the\r\nbaron's castle. \"The doctrine of the chief messuage, which became of\r\nlarge importance in peerage law, made it at times of moment to have on\r\ndistinct record the nomination of what the chief messuage was, often\r\nfor the imperative function of taking _sasine_. In many instances the\r\n_caput baroniæ_, or the court or place for the ceremonial entry to\r\npossession, is the 'moit,' the 'mothill,' the 'auld castell,' the 'auld\r\nwark,' the 'castellsteid,' the 'auld castellsteid,' the 'courthill,'\r\nor in Latin _mons placiti_, _mons viridis_, or _mons castri_.\"[1012]\r\nIn certain places where two mottes are to be found, he was able to\r\nprove that two baronies had once had their seats. Another point which\r\nMr Neilson worked out is the relation of bordlands to mottes. Bordland\r\nor borland, though an English word, is not pre-Conquest; it refers\r\nto \"that species of demesne which the lord reserves for the supply\r\nof his own table.\" It is constantly found in the near proximity of\r\nmottes.[1013]\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of thirty-eight Anglo-Norman or Normanised\r\nadventurers settled in Scotland, on whose lands mottes are to be found.\r\nThe list must be regarded as a tentative one, for had all the names\r\ngiven by Chalmers been included, it would have been more than doubled.\r\nBut the difficulties of obtaining topographical information were so\r\ngreat that it has been judged expedient to give only the names of those\r\nfamilies who are known to have held lands, and in most cases to have\r\nhad their principal residences, in places where mottes are or formerly\r\nwere existing.[1014]\r\n\r\nANSTRUTHER.--William de Candela obtained the lands of Anstruther, in\r\nFife, from David I. His descendants took the surname of Anstruther. The\r\n\"Mothlaw\" of Anstruther is mentioned in 1590.[1015] \"At the W. end of\r\nthe town there is a large mound, called the Chester Hill, in the middle\r\nof which is a fine well.\" (N. S. A., 1845.) The well is an absolute\r\nproof that this was the site of a castle.\r\n\r\nAVENEL.--Walter de Avenel held Abercorn Castle and estate, in\r\nLinlithgow, in the middle of the 12th century. The castle stood on a\r\ngreen mound (N. S. A.) which is clearly marked in the O.M.\r\n\r\nBALLIOL.--The De Bailleul family had their seat at Barnard Castle, in\r\nDurham, after the Conquest. They obtained lands in Galloway from David\r\nI., and had strongholds at Buittle, and Kenmure, in Kirkcudbright. At\r\nBuittle the site of the castle exists, a roughly triangular bailey with\r\na motte at one corner;[1016] and at Kenmure the O.M. clearly shows a\r\nmotte, as does the picture in Grose's _Antiquities of Scotland_. The\r\nterraces probably date from the time when the modern house on top was\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nBARCLAY.--The De Berkeleys sprang from the De Berkeleys of England,\r\nand settled in Scotland in the 12th century. Walter de Berkeley was\r\nChamberlain of Scotland in 1165; William the Lion gave him the manor\r\nof Inverkeilor, in Forfarshire; there he built a castle, on Lunan Bay.\r\n\"An artificial mound on the west side of the bay, called the Corbie's\r\nKnowe, bears evident marks of having been a castle long previous to\r\nthe erection of Redcastle.\" (N. S. A.) The family also had lands in\r\nwhat is now Aberdeenshire, and at Towie, in the parish of Auchterless,\r\nthey had a castle. \"Close to the church of Auchterless there is a small\r\nartificial eminence of an oval shape, surrounded by a ditch, which is\r\nnow in many places filled up. It still retains the name of the Moat\r\nHead, and was formerly the seat of the baronial court.\" (N. S. A.; N.;\r\nC.)\r\n\r\nBRUCE.--The De Brus held lands in North Yorkshire at the time of\r\nthe Domesday Survey. David I. gave them the barony of Annan, in\r\nDumfriesshire. The original charter of this grant still exists in the\r\nBritish Museum, witnessed by a galaxy of Norman names.[1017] Their\r\nchief castles were at Annan and Lochmaben. At Annan, near the site of\r\na later castle, there is still a motte about 50 feet high, with a vast\r\nditch and some traces of a bailey (N.), called the Moat (N. S. A.). The\r\n\"terras de Moit et Bailyis, intra le Northgate,\" are mentioned in 1582.\r\nSouth of the town of Lochmaben, on the N.W. side of the loch, is a fine\r\nmotte called Castle Hill, with some remains of masonry, which is still\r\npointed out as the original castle of the Bruces.[1018] (G.) The fine\r\nmotte and bailey at Moffat must also have been one of their castles, as\r\nMoffat was one of their demesne lands. (Fig. 44.)\r\n\r\nCATHCART.--Name territorial. Rainald de Cathcart witnesses a charter\r\n(in the Paisley Register) in 1179. Near the old castle of Cathcart,\r\nLanark, is \"an eminence called Court Knowe.\" (N. S. A.) As Mr Neilson\r\nhas shown, these court knowes and court hills are generally disused\r\nmottes. The name Rainald is clearly Norman.\r\n\r\nCHEYNE.--This family is first known in 1258, but had then been long\r\nsettled in Scotland, and were hereditary sheriffs of Banffshire.\r\nChalmers only mentions their manor of Inverugie, in Aberdeenshire.\r\nBehind the ruins of Inverugie Castle rises a round flat-topped hill,\r\nwhich was the Castle Hill or Mote Hill of former days. (N. S. A.)\r\n\r\nCOLVILLE.--Appears in Scotland in the reign of Malcolm IV., holding\r\nthe manors of Heton and Oxnam, in Roxburgh. About 1/4 mile from Oxnam\r\n(which was a barony) is a moated mound called Galla Knowe. (O.M., C.,\r\nand N.) Hailes identified the castle in Teviotdale, captured and burnt\r\nby Balliol in 1333, with that of Oxnam.[1019] Le Mote de Oxnam is\r\nmentioned in 1424 (N.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--SCOTTISH MOTTE-CASTLES. Annan. Moffat. Duffus.\r\nLiddesdale.]\r\n\r\nCUMYN, or COMYN.--The first of this family came to Scotland as the\r\nchancellor of David I.[1020] First seated at Linton Roderick, in\r\nRoxburghshire, where there is a rising ground, surrounded formerly\r\nby a foss, the site of the original castle; (G.) a description\r\nwhich seems to suggest a motte. William the Lion gave the Cumyns\r\nKirkintilloch in Dumbarton, and we afterwards find them at Dalswinton\r\nin Dumfriesshire, and Troqueer in Kirkcudbright. At Kirkintilloch the\r\nO.M. shows a square mount concentrically placed in a square enceinte.\r\nThe enclosure was apparently one of the forts on the wall of Agricola,\r\nbut the writer on Kirkintilloch in the N. S. A. suspected that it had\r\nbeen transformed into a castle by the Cumyns. At Dalswinton the O.M.\r\nshows a motte, and calls it the \"site of Cumyn's Castle.\" At Troqueer,\r\n\"directly opposite the spot on the other side the river where Cumyn's\r\nCastle formerly stood is a mote of circular form and considerable\r\nheight.\" (N. S. A.) The Cumyn who held Kirkintilloch in 1201, was made\r\nEarl of Buchan, and held the vast district of Badenoch, or the great\r\nvalley of the Spey. The N. S. A. gives many descriptions of remains\r\nin this region which are suggestive of motte-castles; we can only\r\nname the most striking: Ruthven, \"a castle reared by the Comyns on a\r\ngreen conical mound on the S. bank of the Spey, thought to be partly\r\nartificial,\" now occupied by ruined barracks; Dunmullie, in the parish\r\nof Duthill, where \"there can be traced vestiges of a motte surrounded\r\nby a ditch, on which, according to tradition, stood the castle of the\r\nearly lords\"; Crimond, where Cumyn had a castle, and where there is\r\na small round hill called Castle Hill; and Ellon, where the Earl of\r\nBuchan had his head court, on a small hill which has now disappeared,\r\nbut which was anciently known as the moot-hill of Ellon. Saisin of the\r\nearldom was given on this hill in 1476. (N. S. A.)\r\n\r\nCUNNINGHAM.--Warnebald, who came from the north of England, was a\r\nfollower of the Norman, Hugh de Morville, who gave him the lands of\r\nCunningham, in Ayrshire, from which the family name was taken. In the\r\nparish of Kilmaurs, which is in the district of Cunningham, there is a\r\n\"mote,\" which may have been the castle of Warnebald; at any rate the\r\noriginal manor place of Cunningham was in this parish. It is of course\r\npossible that this motte may have been originally a De Morville castle.\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS.--Name territorial; progenitor was a Fleming, who received\r\nlands on the Douglas water, in Lanark, in the middle of the 12th\r\ncentury. In the park of Douglas, to the east of the modern castle, is\r\na mound called Boncastle, but we are unable to state certainly that it\r\nis a motte. Lag Castle, in the parish of Dunscore, \"has a moat or court\r\nhill a little to the east.\" (N. S. A.: shown in Grose's picture.) It\r\nmust have been originally Douglas land, as in 1408 it was held by an\r\narmour-bearer of Douglas.\r\n\r\nDURAND.--Clearly a Norman name, corrupted into Durham. The family were\r\nseated at Kirkpatrick Durham in the 13th century. There is or was a\r\nmotte at Kirkpatrick.[1021]\r\n\r\nDURWARD.--This family was descended from Alan de Lundin, who was\r\ndur-ward or door-keeper to the king about 1233. They possessed a wide\r\ndomain in Aberdeenshire, and had a castle at Lumphanan, where Edward I.\r\nstayed in 1296. There is a round motte in the Peel Bog at Lumphanan,\r\nsurrounded by a moat, which was fed by a sluice from the neighbouring\r\nburn. There were ruins in masonry on the top some hundred years ago.\r\nThe writer of the N. S. A. account of this place, with remarkable\r\nshrewdness, conjectures that a wooden castle on this mound was the\r\nancient residence of the Durwards, superseded in the 15th century by\r\na building of stone, and that it has nothing to do with Macbeth, whose\r\nburial-place is said to be a cairn in the neighbourhood.[1022]\r\n\r\nFITZ ALAN.--This is the well-known ancestor of the House of Stuart,\r\nWalter, a cadet of a great Norman family in Shropshire, who is said to\r\nhave obtained lands in Scotland in Malcolm Canmore's time. Renfrew was\r\none of his seats, and Inverwick, in Haddington, another. Renfrew Castle\r\nis entirely destroyed, but the description of the site, on a small\r\nhill, ditched round, called Castle Hill, strongly suggests a motte. The\r\nkeep of Inverwick stands on a natural motte of rock.[1023] Dunoon was\r\none of their castles, near to which \"stood the Tom-a-mhoid, or Hill of\r\nthe court of justice\" (G.), possibly an ancient motte.[1024] Dunoon\r\nCastle, however, itself stands on a motte, partly artificial and partly\r\ncarved out of a headland. (N.)\r\n\r\nFLEMING.--There were many Flemings among the followers of David I., and\r\neventually the name stuck to their descendants as a surname. Baldwin\r\nthe Fleming obtained lands at Biggar, in Lanarkshire. There is a motte\r\nat the west end of the town of Biggar, 36 feet high. Biggar was the\r\nhead of a barony. (N. S. A. and N.) Colban the Fleming settled at\r\nColbantown, now Covington, Lanarkshire, where there is a motte (N.).\r\nRobert the Fleming has left a well-preserved oblong motte at Roberton,\r\nin Lanark, which was a barony, and where the _moit_ was spoken of in\r\n1608. (N.)\r\n\r\nGRAHAM.--Came from England under David I., and received lands in\r\nLothian. A Graham was lord of Tarbolton, in Ayrshire, in 1335, so it\r\nis possible that the motte at that place, on which stood formerly the\r\nchief messuage of the barony of Tarbolton, was one of their castles (N.\r\nS. A.), but it may have been older.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON.--It is not certain that the Hamiltons came to Scotland before\r\n1272. King Robert I. gave them the barony of Cadzow, Lanark, which had\r\noriginally been a royal seat. In Hamilton Park there is a mote hill,\r\nwhich was the site of the chief messuage of this barony (N.). It was\r\nformerly surrounded by the town of Hamilton. (N. S. A.) It is of course\r\npossible that this motte may be much older than the Hamiltons, as the\r\nsite of an originally royal castle.\r\n\r\nHAY.--First appears in the 12th century, as butler to Malcolm IV. The\r\nfamily first settled in Lothian, where they had lands at Lochorworth.\r\nThe Borthwick family, who got this estate by marriage, obtained a\r\nlicense from James I. about 1430 to build a castle \"on the mote of\r\nLocherwart,\" and to this castle they gave their own name. (N. S. A.)\r\nNo doubt it was the original motte of the Hays. King William gave the\r\nHays the manor of Errol, in Perthshire, which was made into a barony.\r\nHere is or was the mote of Errol, \"a round artificial mound about 20\r\nfeet high, and 30 feet in diameter at the top; the platform at the top\r\nsurrounded with a low turf wall, and the whole enclosed with a turf\r\nwall at the base, in the form of an equilateral triangle.\" (N. S. A.;\r\nevidently a triangular bailey.) It is called the Law Knoll, and is\r\nspoken of as a _fortalicium_ in 1546. (N.)\r\n\r\nLENNOX.--The earls of Lennox are descended from Arkel, an Englishman,\r\nwho received from Malcolm Canmore lands in Dumbartonshire. At Catter,\r\nnear the Earl's castle, is a large artificial mound.[1025]\r\n\r\nLOCKHART.--Stevenston, in Ayrshire, takes its name from Stephen\r\nLoccard, and Symington, in Lanark, from his son (?), Simon Loccard.\r\nAt Stevenson there was formerly a castle, and there still (1845) is\r\na Castle Hill. Stevenston was given by Richard Morville to Stephen\r\nLoccard about 1170. (N. S. A.) At Symington there was formerly a round\r\nmound, called Law Hill, at the foot of the village, but it has been\r\nlevelled. (N. S. A.)\r\n\r\nLOGAN.--A Robert Logan witnesses a charter of William the Lion, and\r\nappears later as Dominus Robertus de Logan. The name Robert shows his\r\nNorman origin. At Drumore, near Logan (parish of Kirkmaiden, Wigton),\r\nthere was a castle, and there is still a court hill or mote.[1026]\r\nAnother mote, at Myroch, in the same parish, is mentioned by Mr Neilson\r\nas the site of the chief messuage of the barony of Logan.\r\n\r\nLOVEL.--Settled at Hawick, Roxburghshire. The mote of Hawick, from the\r\npicture in Scott's _Border Antiquities_, seems to be a particularly\r\nfine one. Hawick was a barony, and Le Moit is mentioned in 1511. (N.)\r\n\r\nLYLE, or LISLE.--The castle of this Norman family was at Duchal,\r\nRenfrewshire. The plan is clearly that of a motte and bailey, but the\r\nmotte is of natural rock.[1027]\r\n\r\nMALE, now MELVILLE.--Settled in Haddingtonshire under David I., and\r\ncalled their seat Melville. Melville Castle is modern. They afterwards\r\nobtained by marriage lands on the Bervie River, in the Mearns. Dr\r\nChristison's map shows a motte near the mouth of the Bervie.\r\n\r\nMAXWELL.--Maccus, son of Unwin[1028] (evidently of Scandinavian\r\norigin), received lands on the Tweed from David I., and called his seat\r\nMaccusville, corrupted into Maxwell. There is a motte at Maxwell, near\r\nKelso. (N.) Maxton, in Roxburghshire, takes its name from him, and\r\nthere is a motte called Ringley Hall, on the Tweed, in this parish. (C.\r\nand N. S. A.)\r\n\r\nMONTALT, or MOWAT.--Robert de Montalto (Mold, in Flintshire) witnesses\r\na charter of David I. The family settled in Cromarty. Le Mote at\r\nCromarty is mentioned in 1470. (N.)\r\n\r\nMONTGOMERY.--This family is undoubtedly descended from some one of the\r\nsons of the great Earl Roger of Shrewsbury, settled in Scotland after\r\nthe ruin of his family in England. Robert de Montgomerie received\r\nthe manor of Eaglesham, Renfrew, from Fitz Alan, the High Steward of\r\nScotland. The principal messuage of this manor was at Polnoon, 1/2\r\nmile S.E. of Eaglesham. Here Sir John Montgomerie built the castle of\r\nPolnoon about 1388. (N. S. A.) The O.M. seems to show that the ruins\r\nof this castle stand on a motte, probably the original castle of\r\nMontgomerie.\r\n\r\nMORVILLE.--Hugh de Morville was a Northamptonshire baron, the life-long\r\nfriend of David I.[1029] He founded one of the most powerful families\r\nin the south of Scotland, though after three generations their lands\r\npassed to heiresses, and their chief seat is not even known by name.\r\nBut Mr Neilson states that Darnhall, in Peebles, was the head of their\r\n\"Black Barony,\" and that there is a motte there. As Hugh de Morville\r\ngave the church of Borgue to Dryburgh Abbey about 1150, it is probable\r\nthat the motte at Boreland of Borgue was one of his castles. The\r\nbarony of Beith, in Ayr, given by Richard de Morville to the Abbey of\r\nKilwinning, has also a motte, which may be reckoned to be the site of\r\na De Morville castle. Largs, in Ayr, belonged to the De Morvilles, and\r\nhas a Castle Hill near the village, which appears to be a motte. (G.)\r\n\r\nMOWBRAY.--This well-known Norman family also sent a branch to Scotland.\r\nAmongst other places, about which we have no details, they held\r\nEckford, in Roxburghshire. In this parish, near the ancient mansion,\r\nis an artificial mount called Haughhead Kipp. (N. S. A.) This seems a\r\npossible motte, but its features are not described.\r\n\r\nMURRAY.--Freskin the Fleming came to Scotland under David I., and\r\nreceived from that king lands in Moray. He built himself a castle\r\nat Duffus, in Elgin, which is on the motte-and-bailey plan.[1030]\r\nThe stone keep now on the motte appears to be of the 14th century.\r\nFreskin's posterity took the name of De Moravia, or Moray. (Fig. 44.)\r\n\r\nOLIPHANT, or OLIFARD.--Cambuslang, in Lanark, belonged to Walter\r\nOlifard, Justiciary of Lothian in the time of Alexander II. About a\r\nmile E. of the church is a circular mound 20 feet high. It was here\r\nthat the Oliphants' castle of Drumsagard formerly stood. (N. S. A.)\r\nDrumsagard was a barony. (N.)\r\n\r\nDE QUINCY.--Obtained from William the Lion the manors of Travernant, in\r\nEast Lothian, and Leuchars, in Fife. Near the village of Leuchars is\r\na motte with some slight remains of a stone keep, a deep well in the\r\ncentre, and an entrenched bailey, known as the site of the castle of\r\nLeuchars.[1031]\r\n\r\nROSS.--Godfrey de Ros, a vassal of Richard de Morville, held of him the\r\nlands of Stewarton, in Ayr. The _caput_ of the lordship was Castletown,\r\nwhere Le Mote is spoken of in 1451 (N. and C.). The De Ros were also\r\nthe first lords of the barony of Sanquhar. A little lower down the\r\nriver Nith than the later castle of Sanquhar is a mote called Ryehill,\r\nand a place anciently manorial. (N.)\r\n\r\nSOMERVILLE.--William de Somerville was a Norman to whom David I.\r\ngave the manor of Carnwath, in Lanarkshire. There is a very perfect\r\nentrenched motte at Carnwath (N. S. A. and O.M.), and Le Moit de\r\nCarnwath is mentioned in 1599. (N.)\r\n\r\nDE SOULIS.--Followed David I. from Northamptonshire into Scotland, and\r\nreceived Liddesdale, in Roxburghshire, from him. The motte and bailey\r\nof his original castle still remain, very near the more celebrated but\r\nmuch later Hermitage Castle.[1032] (Fig. 44.)\r\n\r\nVALOIGNES.--Philip de Valoignes and his son William were each\r\nsuccessively chamberlains of Scotland.[1033] One of their estates was\r\nEaster Kilbride, in Lanarkshire, where they had a castle. In this\r\nparish is an artificial mount of earth, with an oval area on top, about\r\n1/4 mile from the present house of Torrance. (N. S. A.)\r\n\r\nVAUX, or DE VALLIBUS.--Settled in Scotland under William the Lion. Held\r\nthe manors of Dirleton and Golyn, in East Lothian. Dirleton has been\r\ntransformed into an Edwardian castle, but from the pictures it appears\r\nto stand on a natural motte of rock. But about 3 miles from Dirleton\r\nthe O.M. shows a large motte called Castle Hill, which may possibly be\r\nthe original castle of the De Vaux.\r\n\r\nWALLACE, or WALLENSIS.--Richard Walensis was the first of this family,\r\nand acquired lands in Ayrshire in David I.'s time. He named his seat\r\nRiccardton, after himself, and the remains of his motte are still\r\nthere, a small oval motte called Castle Hill, on which the church of\r\nRiccarton now stands, but which is recognised as having been a \"mote\r\nhill.\" (G.)\r\n\r\nTo this list must be added a number of royal castles known to have been\r\nbuilt in the 12th century, which, as they were built on mottes, must in\r\nthe first instance have been wooden castles.\r\n\r\nBANFF.--It seems clear that Banff Castle had a motte, because the\r\ndoggerel rhymes of Arthur Johnstone in 1642 say:\r\n\r\n    A place was near which was a field until\r\n    Our ancestors did raise it to a hill;\r\n    A stately castle also on it stood.\r\n\r\nThe _Gazetteer_ says: \"The citadel occupied a mount, originally at the\r\nend though now near the middle of the town.\" The site is still called\r\nCastle Hill. (N. S. A.)\r\n\r\nCRAIL, Fife.--The O.M. does not show a motte here. The N. S. A. says\r\n\"there was a royal residence here, upon an eminence overlooking the\r\nharbour.\" That this \"eminence\" was a motte seems clear from the\r\n_Register of the Great Seal_, quoted by Mr Neilson, which speaks of \"Le\r\nMoitt olim Castrum\" in 1573.\r\n\r\nCUPAR.--There seem to be two mottes here, both raised on a natural\r\n\"esker\"; the one formerly called the Castle Hill is now called the\r\nSchool Hill, the school having been built upon it. The other and higher\r\nhill is called the Moot Hill, and is said to be the place where the\r\nearls of Fife used to dispense justice. (N. S. A.) Mr Neilson states\r\nthat both are mentioned in the _Registrum_.\r\n\r\nDUMFRIES.--Here there were two mottes, one being now the site of a\r\nchurch, the other, called Castle Dykes, a short distance S. of the\r\ntown, on the opposite side of the river. Both no doubt were royal\r\ncastles, and Mr Neilson has suggested that as an _old castlestead_\r\nis spoken of in a charter of William the Lion, it implies that a new\r\ncastle had recently been built, possibly after the great destruction of\r\nthe royal castles in Galloway in 1174.[1034] The Castle Dykes appears\r\nto be the later castle, as it is spoken of in the 16th century. (N.)\r\n\r\nDUNSKEATH, Cromarty.--Built by William the Lion in 1179. The castle is\r\nbuilt on a small _moat_ overhanging the sea. (G.)\r\n\r\nELGIN.--Built by William the Lion on a small green hill called Lady\r\nHill, with conical and precipitous sides. (N. S. A. and G.)\r\n\r\nFORFAR.--\"The castle stood on a round hill to the N. of the town, and\r\nmust have been surrounded by water.\" (N. S. A.) It was destroyed in\r\n1307. It is called Gallow Hill in the O.M., and is now occupied by\r\ngasworks.\r\n\r\nFORRES.--The plan in Chalmers' _Caledonia_ clearly shows a motte, to\r\nwhich the town appears to have formed a bailey.\r\n\r\nINVERNESS.--Built by David I. when he annexed Moray. The site is now\r\noccupied by a gaol, but the O.M. shows it to have been a motte, which\r\nis clearly depicted in old engravings.\r\n\r\nINNERMESSAN.--As the lands here appear to have been royal property as\r\nlate as the time of David II., the large round motte here may have been\r\nan early royal castle, a conjecture which finds some confirmation in\r\nthe name \"Boreland of Kingston,\" which Pont places in the same parish.\r\n(N. S. A.)\r\n\r\nJEDBURGH.--Probably built by David I. The site, which is still\r\ncalled Castle Hill, has been levelled and completely obliterated by\r\nthe building of a gaol. Yet an old plan of the town in 1762, in the\r\npossession of the late Mr Laidlaw of Jedburgh, shows the outline of the\r\ncastle to have been exactly that of a motte and bailey, though, as no\r\nhachures are given, it is not absolutely convincing.\r\n\r\nKINCLEVEN, Perth.--The O.M. shows no earthworks connected with the\r\npresent castle, but on the opposite side of the river it places a motte\r\ncalled Castle Hill, which may very likely be the site of the original\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nKIRKCUDBRIGHT.--Dr Christison marks a motte here, to the W. of the\r\ntown. The place is called Castle Dykes. Mr Coles says it has an oblong\r\ncentral mound and a much larger entrenched area.[1035]\r\n\r\nLANARK.--Ascribed traditionally to David I. \"On a small artificially\r\nshaped hill between the town and the river, at the foot of the street\r\ncalled Castle Gate, and still bearing the name of Castle Hill, there\r\nstood in former times beyond all doubt a royal castle.\" (N. S. A.) Mr\r\nNeilson says, \"It certainly bears out its reputation as an artificial\r\nmound.\"\r\n\r\nROSEMARKIE, Cromarty.--Was made a royal burgh by Alexander II., so the\r\ncastle must have been originally royal. \"Immediately above the town is\r\na mound of nearly circular form, and level on the top, which seems to\r\nbe artificial, and has always been called the Court Hill.\" (N. S. A.)\r\n\r\nEven if we had no other evidence that motte-castles were of Norman\r\nconstruction, this list would be very significant. But taken in\r\nconnection with the evidence for the Norman origin of the English,\r\nWelsh, and Irish mottes, it supplies ample proof that in Scotland, as\r\nelsewhere, the Norman and feudal settlement had its material guarantees\r\nin the castles which were planted all over the land, and that these\r\ncastles were the simple structures of earth and wood, whose earthen\r\nremains have been the cause of so much mystification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMOTTE-CASTLES IN IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1169, when the first Norman invaders landed in Ireland,\r\nthe private castle had been in existence in England for more than a\r\nhundred years, and had it been suited to the social organisation of\r\nthe Irish people, there had been plenty of time for its introduction\r\ninto Ireland. Nor are we in a position to deny that some chieftain\r\nwith a leaning towards foreign fashions _may_ have built for himself a\r\ncastle in the Anglo-Norman style; all we can say is that there is not\r\nthe slightest evidence of such a thing.[1036] We have two contemporary\r\naccounts of the Norman settlement in Ireland, the one given by Giraldus\r\nin his _Expugnatio Hibernica_, and the Anglo-Norman poem, edited\r\nby Mr Goddard H. Orpen, under the title of the \"Song of Dermot and\r\nthe Earl.\"[1037] Now Giraldus expressly tells us that the Irish did\r\nnot use castles, but preferred to take refuge in their forests and\r\nbogs.[1038] The statement is a remarkable one, since Ireland abounds\r\nwith defensive works of a very ancient character; are we to suppose\r\nthat these were only used in the prehistoric period? But if castles of\r\nthe Norman kind had been in general use in Ireland in the 12th century,\r\nwe should certainly hear of their having been a serious hindrance to\r\nthe invaders. The history of the invasion, however, completely confirms\r\nthe statement of Giraldus; we never once hear of the Irish defending\r\nthemselves in a castle. When they do stand a siege, it is in a walled\r\ntown, and a town which has been walled, not by themselves, but by the\r\nDanes, to whom Giraldus expressly attributes these walls. Moreover,\r\nthe repeated insistence of Giraldus on the necessity of systematic\r\nincastellation of the whole country[1039] is proof enough that no such\r\nincastellation existed.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in some of the earliest Irish literature we hear of\r\nthe _dun_, _lis_, or _rath_ (the words are interchangeable), which\r\nencircled the chieftain's house.\r\n\r\nMany descriptions of royal abodes in Irish poems are evidently purely\r\nfanciful, but underneath the poetical adornments we can discern the\r\nfeatures of the great wooden hall which appears to have been the\r\nresidence of the tribal chieftain, whether Keltic, Norse, or Saxon,\r\nthroughout the whole north of Europe in early times.[1040] The\r\nthousands of earthen rings, generally called _raths_, which are still\r\nscattered over Ireland, are believed to be the enclosures of these\r\nkings' or chieftains' homesteads. Were they intended for serious\r\nmilitary defence? We are not in a position to answer this question\r\ncategorically, but the plans of a number of them which we have examined\r\ndo not suggest anything but a very slight fortification, sufficient to\r\nkeep off wolves. At all events we never hear of these raths or duns\r\nstanding a siege; the conquering raider comes, sees, and burns.[1041]\r\nWe are therefore justified in concluding that they did not at all\r\ncorrespond to what we mean by a private castle. And most certainly\r\nthe motte-castle, with its very small citadel, and its limited\r\naccommodation for the flocks and herds of a tribe, was utterly unsuited\r\nto the requirements of the tribal system.\r\n\r\nA good deal of light is thrown on the way in which Irish chieftains\r\nregarded private castles at the time of the invasion by the well-known\r\nstory of one who refused a castle offered him by the invaders, saying\r\nthat he preferred a castle of bones to a castle of stones. Whether\r\nlegendary or not, it represents the natural feeling of a man who had\r\nbeen accustomed to sleep trustfully in the midst of men of his own\r\nblood, tied to him by the bonds of the clan. The clan system in\r\nIreland undoubtedly led to great misery through the absence of a\r\ncentral authority to check the raids of one clan upon another; but\r\nthough we occasionally hear of a chieftain being murdered \"by his own,\"\r\nwe have no reason to think that clan loyalty was not sufficient, as\r\na rule, for the internal safety of the community. So that a popular\r\nchieftain might well refuse a fortification which had every mark of a\r\nhateful and suspicious invader.[1042]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is--or has been until quite recently--a strong\r\nprejudice in the minds of Irish antiquaries that works of the\r\nmotte-and-bailey kind belong to the prehistoric age of Ireland. Irish\r\nscholars indeed admit that the word _mota_ is not found in any Irish\r\nMS. which dates from before the Norman invasion of Ireland.[1043] We\r\nmust therefore bear in mind that when they tell us that such and such\r\nan ancient book mentions the \"mote\" at Naas or elsewhere, what they\r\nmean is that it mentions a _dun_, or _rath_, or _longport_, which\r\nthey imagine to be the same as a motte. But this is begging the whole\r\nquestion. There is not the slightest proof that any of these words\r\nmeant a motte. _Dun_ is often taken to mean a hill (perhaps from its\r\nresemblance to Anglo-Saxon _dun_), but Keltic scholars are now agreed\r\nthat it is cognate with the German _zaun_ and Anglo-Saxon _tun_,\r\nmeaning a fenced enclosure.[1044] It may be applied to a fort on a\r\nhill, but it may equally well be applied to a fort on the flat. _Rath_\r\nis translated _fossa_ in the _Book of Armagh_; Jocelin of Furness\r\nequates it with _murus_.[1045] The rath of Armagh was evidently a\r\nvery large enclosure in 1166, containing several streets, houses, and\r\nchurches, so it was certainly not a motte.[1046] It is of course not\r\nimpossible that the Normans may sometimes have occupied an ancient\r\nfortified site, but we may be sure from the considerations already\r\nurged that the fortifications which they erected were of a wholly\r\ndifferent character to the previous ones, even if they utilised a\r\nportion for their bailey.\r\n\r\nIt is of course difficult to decide in some cases (both in Ireland and\r\nelsewhere) whether a mound which stands alone without a bailey is a\r\nsepulchral tumulus or a motte. There are some mottes in England and\r\nScotland which have no baileys attached to them, and do not appear ever\r\nto have had any. In Ireland, the country of magnificent sepulchral\r\ntumuli, it is not wonderful that the barrow and the motte have become\r\nconfused in popular language. It would appear, too, that there exist\r\nin Ireland several instances of artificial tumuli which were used for\r\nthe inauguration of Irish chieftains, and these have occasionally been\r\nmistaken for mottes.[1047] As Mr Orpen has shown, there are generally\r\nindications in the unsuitability of the sites, in the absence of\r\nreal fortification, or in the presence of sepulchral signs, to show\r\nthat these tumuli did not belong to the motte class. Magh Adair, for\r\nexample, which has been adduced as a motte outside the Norman boundary,\r\nis shown by Mr Orpen to be of quite a different character.\r\n\r\nAt many sites in Ireland where the Normans are known to have built\r\ncastles at an early period of the invasion there are no mottes to be\r\nseen now. It is probable that where the Norman conquerors had both\r\nmoney and time at their disposal they built stone keeps from the first,\r\nand that the motte-castles, with their wooden towers or _bretasches_,\r\nwere built in the times of stress, or were the residences of the less\r\nwealthy under-tenants. But we know from documents that even in John's\r\nreign the important royal castle of Roscrea was built with a motte and\r\nbretasche,[1048] which proves that this type of castle was still so\r\nmuch esteemed that we may feel reasonably certain that when Giraldus\r\nspeaks of \"slender defences of turf and stakes\" he does not mean\r\nmotte-castles, but mere embankments and palisades.[1049]\r\n\r\nBut there is another reason for the absence of mottes from some of the\r\nearly Norman castle sites. Those who have examined the castles of Wales\r\nknow that it is rare to find a motte in a castle which has undergone\r\nthe complete metamorphoses of the Edwardian[1050] period. These new\r\ncastles had no keeps, and necessitated an entire change of plan, which\r\nled either to the destruction of the motte or the building of an\r\nentirely new castle on a different site. The removal of a motte is only\r\na question of spade labour, and many sites in England can be pointed\r\nout where mottes are known to have existed formerly, but where now not\r\na vestige is left.[1051] There are many other cases where the Edwardian\r\ncastle shows not a trace of any former earthworks, but where a motte\r\nand bailey a little distance off probably represents the original\r\nwooden castle.[1052]\r\n\r\nThe passion for identifying existing earthworks with sites mentioned\r\nin ancient Irish history or legend has been a most serious hindrance\r\nto the progress of real archæological knowledge in Ireland. It is not\r\nuntil one begins to look into this matter that one finds out what giddy\r\nguesswork most of these identifications of Irish place-names really\r\nare. O'Donovan was undoubtedly a great Irish scholar, and his editions\r\nof the _Book of Rights_ and the _Annals of the Four Masters_ are of\r\nthe highest importance. The topographical notes to these works are\r\ngenerally accepted as final. But let us see what his method was in this\r\npart of his labours. In the _Book of Rights_, he says very naïvely,\r\nabout a place called Ladhrann or Ardladhrann, \"I cannot find any place\r\nin Wexford according with the notices of this place except Ardamine,\r\non the sea-coast, where there is a remarkable _moat_.\"[1053] No modern\r\nphilologist, we think, would admit that Ardamine could be descended\r\nfrom Ardladhrann. In the same way O'Donovan guessed Treada-na-righ,\r\n\"the triple-fossed fort of the kings,\" to be the motte of Kilfinnane,\r\nnear Kilmallock. But this was a pure guess, as he had previously\r\nguessed it to be \"one of the forts called Dun-g-Claire.\" To the\r\nantiquaries of that day one earthwork seemed as good as another, and\r\ndifferences of type were not considered important.[1054]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following list of early Norman castles in Ireland was first\r\npublished in the _Antiquary_ for 1906. It is an attempt to form a\r\ncomplete list from contemporary historians only, that is, from Giraldus\r\nCambrensis and the \"Song of Dermot,\" and from the documents published\r\nin Sweetman's _Calendar_, of the Norman castles built in Ireland,\r\nup to the end of John's reign.[1055] Since then, the task has been\r\ntaken up on a far more philosophical plan by Mr Goddard H. Orpen,\r\nwhose exceptional knowledge of the history of the invasion and the\r\nfamilies of the conquerors has enabled him to trace their settlements\r\nin Ireland as they have never been traced before.[1056] Nevertheless,\r\nit still seems worth while to republish this list, as though within\r\na limited compass, consistent with the writer's limited knowledge,\r\nit furnishes an adequate test of the correctness of the Norman\r\ntheory, on a perfectly sound basis. The list has now the advantage\r\nof being corrected from Mr Orpen's papers, and of being enlarged by\r\nidentifications which he has been able to make.[1057]\r\n\r\n*ANTRIM[1058] (_Cal._, i., 88).--A royal castle in 1251. Present castle\r\nmodern; close to it is a large motte, marked in 25-inch O.M.\r\n\r\nAQ'I (_Cal._, i., 13).--Unidentified; perhaps an _alias_ for one of the\r\nLimerick castles, as it was certainly in the county of Limerick.\r\n\r\nARDFINNAN, Tipperary (_Gir._, v., 386).--Built in 1185, immediately\r\nafter John's coming to Ireland. No motte; castle is late Edwardian and\r\npartly converted into a modern house; one round tower has ogee windows.\r\n[B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nARDMAYLE, or ARMOLEN, Tipperary (_Cal._, i., 81).--A castle of Theobald\r\nWalter. A motte with half-moon bailey, and earthen wing walls running\r\nup its sides, exactly as stone walls do in later Norman castles. Ruins\r\nof a Perpendicular mansion close to it, and also a square tower with\r\nogee windows. [B. T. S.] Fig. 45.\r\n\r\nARDNURCHER, or HORSELEAP, King's Co. (_Song of Dermot_ and _Cal._, i.,\r\n145).--A castle of Meiler Fitz Henry's, built in 1192.[1059] An oblong\r\nmotte with one certain bailey, and perhaps a second. No masonry but the\r\nremains of a wall or bridge across the fosse. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nARDREE, Kildare (_Gir._, v., 356, and _Song_).--The castle built\r\nby Hugh de Lacy for Thomas the Fleming in 1182, was at Ardri, on\r\nthe Barrow. There is an artificial mound at Ardree, turned into a\r\ngraveyard, and near it a levelled platform above the river, on which\r\nstands Ardree House.[1060] On the west bank of the Barrow, opposite\r\nArdree, is a low circular motte with ditch and bank, but no bailey. A\r\npiece of Norman pottery with green glaze was found by Mr Stallybrass,\r\none foot below the surface in the counterscarp bank. Mr Orpen thinks\r\nthis motte may have been the castle of Robert de Bigarz, also mentioned\r\nby Giraldus as near Ardree, on the opposite side of the Barrow.\r\n\r\nASKEATON, or HINNESKESTI, Limerick.--Built in 1199, probably by Hamo de\r\nValoignes.[1061] An excellent instance of a motte-and-bailey castle,\r\nwhere the motte is of natural rock. The splendid keep and hall are of\r\nthe 15th century, but there are two older towers, which might date from\r\n1199. This natural motte has been identified with the ancient Irish\r\nfort of Gephthine (Askeaton = Eas Gephthine), mentioned in the _Book\r\nof Rights_. But this work does not mention any _fort_ at Gephthine,\r\nonly the place, in a list which is clearly one of lands (perhaps mensal\r\nlands), not of forts, as it contains many names of plains, and of\r\ntribes, as well as the three isles of Arran.[1062]\r\n\r\n*ASKELON, or ESCLUEN (_Cal._, i., 91).--Castle _restored to_ Richard de\r\nBurgh in 1215; the site is placed by Mr Orpen at Carrigogunell, which\r\nis in the parish of Kilkeedy, Limerick.[1063] Carrigogunell has the\r\nruins of a castle on a natural motte of rock.\r\n\r\n*ATHLONE, Roscommon (_Cal._, i., 80).--Built in 1210 by the Justiciar,\r\nJohn de Gray. The keep is placed on a lofty motte, which has been\r\nrevetted with masonry. Turlough O'Connor built a _caislen_ at Athlone\r\nin 1129, but it was not even on the site of the Norman castle, for\r\nwhich John obtained land from the church, as already stated.\r\n\r\nBAGINBUN (_Gir._, i., 13; _Song_, 1406).--Mr Orpen has proved that\r\nthis was the spot where Raymond le Gros landed and entrenched himself\r\nfor four months.[1064] It is a headland on the sea-coast, and headland\r\ncastles seldom have mottes, as they were not needed on a promontory\r\nwashed on three sides by the sea. Moreover, Baginbun was of the nature\r\nof a temporary fort rather than a residential castle, and it is to\r\nbe noted that Giraldus calls it \"a poor sort of a castle of stakes\r\nand sods.\" Still, the small inner area, ditched off with a double\r\nditch, and the large area, also ditched, roughly correspond to the\r\nmotte-and-bailey plan. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nBALIMORE EUSTACE, Kildare (_Cal._, i., 28).--A castle of the Archbishop\r\nof Dublin. A motte, with a remarkable platform attached to one side\r\n(_cf._ Wigmore Castle). No bailey now; no stone castle. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nCAHERCONLISH (Karkinlis, Kakaulis, _Cal._, i., 81).--Castle of Theobald\r\nFitz Walter. There is nothing left above ground but a chimney of\r\nlate date. A few yards from it is a hillock, which has very much the\r\nappearance of a mutilated motte. [E. S. A.] Mr Orpen, however, thinks\r\nthat Theobald's castle may have been at Knockatancashlane, \"the hill of\r\nthe old castle,\" a townland a little to the north of Caherconlish.[1065]\r\n\r\nCARBURY, Kildare.--The _Song_ says Meiler Fitz Henry first got\r\nCarbury, so the castle was probably his. It is a motte with two\r\nbaileys, one of imperfect outline, the other a curious little\r\nhalf-circle. A 15th-century castle is built against the side of the\r\nmotte. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nCARLINGFORD, Louth (_Cal._, i., 95).--Apparently a royal castle\r\n(_Cal._, i., 156), first mentioned in 1215. It stands on a rock, which\r\nmight possibly have been a former motte. There certainly has been a\r\nformer castle, for the present ruin is Edwardian in plan and in every\r\ndetail. [E. S. A.]\r\n\r\nCARRICK, Wexford (_Gir._, v., 245).--This again seems to be one of\r\nthe temporary forts built by the first invaders (in this case Fitz\r\nStephen), in a strong natural situation, and Giraldus applies to it the\r\nsame contemptuous language as to Baginbun. There is no motte, but an\r\noval area of 45 yards by 25 is ditched and banked; a modern imitation\r\nof a round tower stands within the enclosure. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nCARRICKFERGUS, Antrim (_Cal._, i., 107).--This was probably one of\r\nthe castles built by John de Courcy, the conqueror of Ulster. The\r\ngatehouse and mural towers are late, but the keep may well be of De\r\nCourcy's time, and furnishes an excellent instance of a castle on the\r\nkeep-and-bailey plan, built by the Normans in stone from the beginning.\r\n[E. S. A.]\r\n\r\nCASTLETOWN DELVIN, Westmeath (_Gir._, v., 356).--Castle of Gilbert\r\nde Nungent. A motte, with a garden at base, which may have been the\r\nbailey; near it the stone castle, a keep with round towers at the\r\nangles, probably not as early as John's reign. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nCLONARD, Meath (_Gir._, v., 356).--Built by Hugh de Lacy about 1182. A\r\nmotte, with broad ditch and curious little oblong bailey; no remains in\r\nmasonry. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nCLONMACNOISE, King's Co. (_Cal._, i., 94).--First contemporary mention\r\n1215; the _Annals of Loch Cè_ say it was built in 1214 \"by the\r\nforeigners.\" A royal castle. A large motte with bailey attached; the\r\nwing walls of the bailey run up the motte. The importance of the castle\r\nis shown by the fact that a stone keep was added not very long after it\r\nwas built. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n*COLLACHT (_Gir._, v., 355).--Castle of John of Hereford. Collacht\r\nappears to be a scribal error for Tullaght, now Tullow, Carlow.[1066]\r\nThe site of the castle is marked on the 6-inch O.M.; it has been\r\nvisited by Mr G. H. Orpen, who found very clear indications of a motte\r\nand bailey. (See Appendix L.)\r\n\r\nCROMETH (_Cal._, i., 91).--Castle of Maurice FitzGerald. Supposed\r\nto be Croom, Limerick, though the identification is by no means\r\ncertain.[1067] There are the ruins of an Edwardian castle at Croom; no\r\nmotte. [E. S. A.]\r\n\r\nDOWNPATRICK, Down (_Gir._, v., 345).--The traveller approaching\r\nDownpatrick sees a number of small hills which no doubt have once\r\nbeen islands rising out of the swamps of the Quoyle. On one of these\r\nhills stands the town and its cathedral; on another, to the east, but\r\nseparated from the town by a very steep descent and a brook, stands\r\na motte and bailey of the usual Norman type. It occupies the whole\r\nsummit of the small hill, so that the banks of the bailey are at a\r\ngreat height above the outer ditch, which is carried round the base of\r\nthe hill (compare Skipsea). The motte, which is not a very large one,\r\nhas had an earthen breastwork round the top, now much broken away.\r\nIts ditch falls into the ditch of the bailey, but at a higher level.\r\nThe bailey is semilunar, extending round about three-quarters of the\r\ncircumference of the motte. There is not the slightest sign of masonry.\r\nAs the size of this work has been greatly exaggerated, it is as well to\r\nsay that when measured on the 25-inch O.M. with a planimeter, its area\r\nproves to be 3.9 acres; the area of the motte and its ditch .9, leaving\r\n3 acres for the bailey. [E. S. A.] Fig. 45.\r\n\r\nThis thoroughly Norman-French castle, which was formerly called a\r\nDanish fort, has lately been baptised as Rathceltchair, and supposed\r\nto be the work of a mythical hero of the 1st century A.D. Mr Orpen,\r\nhowever, has disposed of this fancy by showing that the name\r\nRathceltchair belonged in pre-Norman times to the enclosure of the\r\nancient church and monastery which stood on the _other_ hill.[1068]\r\nWe may therefore unhesitatingly ascribe this motte-castle to John de\r\nCourcy, who first put up a slender fortification within the town walls\r\nto defend himself against temporary attack,[1069] but afterwards built\r\na regular castle, for which this island offered a most favourable\r\nsite.[1070] A stone castle was built inside the town at a later period;\r\nit is now entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\nDROGHEDA, Louth (_Cal._, i., 93).--First mention 1203, but Mr Orpen\r\nthinks it probable that it was one of the castles built by Hugh de\r\nLacy, who died in 1186. A high motte, with a round and a square bailey,\r\njust outside the town walls;[1071] called the Mill Mount in the time\r\nof Cromwell, who occupied it; he mentions that it had a good ditch,\r\nstrongly palisadoed.[1072] No stone castle, though much of the\r\nbailey wall remains; a late martello tower on top of motte. [B. T. S.]\r\nFig. 45.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--IRISH MOTTE-CASTLES. Ardmayle. Downpatrick.\r\nDrogheda. Castlenock.]\r\n\r\nDULEEK, Meath (the castrum Duvelescense of _Giraldus_, v.,\r\n313).--Probably first built by Hugh de Lacy; restored by Raymond le\r\nGros in 1173. The motte is destroyed, but an old weaver living in the\r\nvillage in 1906 says that it existed in the time of his father, who\r\nused to roll stones down it in his youth. It was in the angle between\r\ntwo streams, and there is still a slight trace of it. No stone castle.\r\n[B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nDUNAMASE, Queen's Co. (Dumath, _Cal._, i., 100).--First mentioned in\r\n1215 as a castle of William Marshall's, which makes it not unlikely\r\nthat it was originally built by Strongbow. The plan of this castle is\r\nthe motte-and-bailey plan, but the place of the motte is taken by a\r\nnatural rock, isolated by a ditch. There are three baileys, descending\r\nthe hill. The stone keep on the summit is of the 15th or 16th century.\r\n[B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nDUNGARVAN, Waterford (_Cal._, i., 89).--Granted to Thomas Fitz Antony\r\nin 1215. To the west of the town is a motte called Gallowshill; it has\r\nno bailey, but some trace of a circumvallation. The castle east of the\r\nriver is not earlier than the 14th or 15th century. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n*DURROW, King's Co. (_Gir._, v., 387).--A castle of Hugh de Lacy's;\r\nhe was murdered while he was building it, because he had chosen the\r\nenclosure of the church for his bailey.[1073] A plan in _Journ. R. S.\r\nA. I._, xxix., 227, shows clearly the motte and bailey, though the\r\nwriter mistakes for separate mounds what are clearly broken portions of\r\nthe vallum. It is possible that the bailey may have followed the line\r\nof the ancient _rath_ of the church, but it would almost certainly be a\r\nmuch stronger affair.\r\n\r\n*FAVORIE = FORE, Westmeath.--I owe this identification to Mr Orpen. As\r\nHugh de Lacy founded or endowed the monastery at Fore,[1074] this was\r\nprobably one of his castles, but the first mention is in 1215 (_Cal._,\r\ni., 95). Mr Westropp mentions the oval motte of Fore with its bailey in\r\nhis list of \"complex motes.\"[1075]\r\n\r\nFERNS, Wexford (_Gir._, v., 326).--A castle was built by Walter the\r\nGerman _near_ Ferns. Ferns is spoken of as a city in the time of King\r\nDermot. There is no motte at Ferns; the stone castle has a keep, which\r\nis certainly not earlier than the time of Henry III. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n*FOTHERET ONOLAN, castle of Raymond le Gros (_Gir._, v., 355).--Mr\r\nOrpen identifies this with Castlemore, near Tullow, Co. Carlow.\r\nThere is an oval motte, and a rectangular bailey with indications of\r\nmasonry.[1076]\r\n\r\nGALTRIM, Meath.--Identified by Mr Orpen with the castle of Hugh de\r\nHose, or Hussey, mentioned in the \"Song of Dermot.\" Destroyed in 1176;\r\nno stone castle. An oval motte; bailey indistinctly traceable. [B. T.\r\nS.]\r\n\r\nGEASHILL, King's Co. (_Cal._, i., 30).--Mentioned in 1203 as a castle\r\nof William, Earl Marshall. There are remains of a motte, on which\r\nstands a 14th-century keep; but the whole site has been so pulled about\r\nin making a modern house, drive, and gardens, that nothing more can be\r\nmade of the plan. The motte, however, is plain, though mutilated. [E.\r\nS. A.]\r\n\r\nGRANARD, Longford (_Cal._, i., 95).--Built by Richard Tuit in\r\n1199.[1077] A magnificent motte, with a very wide ditch, and a small\r\nfan-shaped bailey. Foundations of a shell wall round the top of the\r\nmotte, and of a small round tower in the centre. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n*HINCHELEDER, or INCHELEFYRE (_Cal._, i, 95).--Said by Butler (_Notices\r\nof Trim Castle_, 12) to be Inchleffer, Meath, a castle of Hugh de Lacy.\r\nNo further information.\r\n\r\nJOHN DE CLAHULL'S CASTLE.--Mr Orpen believes this to be Killeshin,\r\nQueen's Co., as it corresponds to the description in the _Song_, \"entre\r\nEboy et Lethelyn.\" There is a motte there, and traditions of a town.\r\n\r\n*KARAKITEL, or CARRICKITTLE, Limerick (_Cal._, i., 14).--Castle of\r\nWilliam de Naas in 1199. There was a remarkable natural motte of rock\r\nhere, with the foundations of a castle upon it, now destroyed.[1078]\r\n\r\n*KILLAMLUN (_Cal._, i., 53).--Identified by Mr Orpen with Killallon,\r\nMeath, where there is a large motte. There is a stone passage into\r\nthis motte, but no evidence has been brought forward to prove that it\r\nis of the same nature as the prehistoric _souterrains_ so common in\r\nIreland.[1079] In England there is a remarkable instance at Oxford of a\r\nwell-chamber built inside a motte.\r\n\r\nKILLARE, Westmeath (_Gir._, v., 356).--A castle of Hugh de Lacy,\r\nbuilt in 1184;[1080] burnt in 1187. A good motte, with ditch and\r\nwell-preserved bank on counterscarp; no bailey. No stone castle. [B. T.\r\nS.]\r\n\r\nKILBIXIE, Westmeath.--Identified by Mr Orpen with Kelbery, given to\r\nGeoffrey de Constantin (_Song_, 3154); the castle is mentioned in a\r\ncharter of Walter de Lacy, as well as in the _Annals of Loch Cè_, which\r\nstate that it was built in 1192. A motte, with a broad ditch, and no\r\nbailey; but on the W. side the counterscarp bank of the ditch widens\r\nout into a sort of narrow half-moon terrace. This peculiarity may be\r\nnoted in several other Irish castles. Foundations of an oblong shell on\r\ntop of motte, and of a small square tower in the centre of this ward.\r\n[B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n*KILFEAKLE, Tipperary (_Cal._, i., 29).--A castle of William de Burgh.\r\nBuilt in 1193.[1081] A motte and bailey; trace of a stone wing wall\r\ndown the motte.[1082]\r\n\r\n*KILMEHAL (_Cal._, i., 44).--Mr Orpen regards the identification of\r\nthis castle with Kilmallock as extremely doubtful.\r\n\r\n*KILMORE (_Cal._, i., 95).--Restored to Walter de Lacy in 1215.\r\nIdentified with Kilmore, near Lough Oughter, Cavan.[1083] Mr Westropp\r\nmentions the motte at this place, which is outside the Anglo-Norman\r\narea. The castle was wrecked in 1225 or 1226, and no more is heard of\r\nit. The Anglo-Norman advance in this direction failed.\r\n\r\n*KILSANTAN, Londonderry (_Cal._, i., 70).--Built by John de Courcy in\r\n1197.[1084] Now called Kilsandal, or Mount Sandal, a large motte on the\r\nBann, not far from Coleraine. The castle of Coleraine, inside the town,\r\nwas built in 1214, apparently of stone,[1085] and probably superseded\r\nthe castle of Kilsandal.\r\n\r\nKILTINAN, Tipperary (_Cal._, i., 94).--Castle of Philip of Worcester\r\nin 1215. No motte; a headland castle overhanging a river valley. The\r\ncastle has not only undergone a late Edwardian transformation, but has\r\nbeen cut up to make a modern mansion and farm buildings. No fosses or\r\nearthworks remain. [E. S. A.]\r\n\r\nKNOCK, or CASTLEKNOCK, Dublin (_Cal._, i., 81).--Castle of Hugh Tyrrel.\r\nAn oval motte, walled round the top, carrying on its edge a smaller\r\nmotte (with traces of a ditch) on which stand the ruins of an octagonal\r\nkeep. No other bailey; ditch and bank double for more than half the\r\ncircumference. [B. T. S.] Fig. 45.\r\n\r\n*KNOCKGRAFFAN, Tipperary (_Cal._, i., 27).--Castle of William de\r\nBraose in 1202. One of the finest mottes to be seen anywhere. Built\r\nin 1192, at the same time as the castle of Kilfeakle.[1086] The motte\r\nis 55 feet high, has a wide ditch and high counterscarp bank, which\r\nis also carried round the ditch of the \"hatchet-shaped\" bailey, in\r\nproper Norman fashion. \"There are indications of a rectangular stone\r\nbuilding on the flat summit of the mote, and there are extensive stone\r\nfoundations in the bailey.\"[1087]\r\n\r\n*LAGELACHON (_Cal._, i., 95).--Probably Loughan or Castlekieran, in\r\nwhich parish is the great motte of Derver.[1088]\r\n\r\nLEA, Queen's Co. (_Cal._, i., 30).--Castle of William, Earl Marshall,\r\nin 1203. A motte with two baileys; motte entirely occupied, and partly\r\nmutilated by a 13th-century keep, with two large roundels. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nLEIGHLIN, Carlow.--Mr Orpen has shown that the fine motte of\r\nBallyknockan answers to the description given by Giraldus of the site\r\nof the castle of Lechlin built by Hugh de Lacy.[1089] There is a trace\r\nof a possible bailey. The stone castle called Black Castle at Leighlin\r\nBridge is of very late date. Those who believe that we have authentic\r\nhistory of Ireland in the 3rd century B.C. will be able to believe\r\nwith Dr Joyce that the description of the annalists identifies this\r\nmotte with the site of the ancient palace of Dinn Righ, burnt by the\r\nchieftain Maen at that date! [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nLISMORE, Waterford (_Gir._, i., 386).--About a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom Lismore, above a ford of the river, is an excellent specimen of\r\na Norman motte and bailey, called the Round Hill. The name of the\r\nprehistoric fort of Dunsginne has lately been applied to it, but purely\r\nby guesswork.[1090] The _Song_ says that Henry II. intended to build a\r\ncastle at Lismore, and that it knows not why he put it off. Possibly\r\nhe may have placed these earthworks here, and never added the wooden\r\ncastle, or else this is the site of the castle which was built by his\r\nson John in 1185. The castle inside the town is certainly later than\r\nthe time of John, as although much modernised it is clearly Edwardian\r\nin plan. The Norman fragments incorporated in the walls probably\r\nbelonged to the abbey of St Carthagh, on the site of which the town\r\ncastle is said to have been built. The so-called King John's Tower is\r\nonly a mural tower, not a keep. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n*LOUTH, or LUVETH (_Cal._, i., 30).--A royal castle in 1204, but\r\nit must have been in existence as early as 1196, when the town and\r\ncastle of Louth were burnt by Niall MacMahon.[1091] This was probably\r\nthe \"Fairy Mount\" at Louth, of which a plan is given in Wright's\r\n_Louthiana_. This plan shows \"the old town trench,\" starting from\r\nopposite sides of the motte, so that the castle stood on the line of\r\nthe town banks. The motte was ditched and banked round, but the plan\r\ndoes not show any bailey or any entrance.\r\n\r\n*LOSKE (CAL., i., 30).--Mr Orpen has pointed out to the writer that\r\nthis cannot be Lusk, which was a castle of the Archbishop of Dublin,\r\nwhile Loske belonged to Theobald Walter, and is not yet identified.\r\n\r\n*LOXHINDY (_Cal._, i., 95).--Mr Orpen identifies this name with\r\nLoughsendy, or Ballymore Loughsendy, Westmeath, where there is a\r\nmotte.[1092]\r\n\r\nNAAS, Kildare (_Gir._, v., 100).--The _dun_ of Naas is mentioned in the\r\n_Book of Rights_, p. 251, and in the _Tripartite Life of St Patrick_.\r\nBy the _Dindsenchas_ it is attributed to the legendary Princess\r\nTuiltinn in 277 A.D. On this \"evidence\" the motte at Naas has been\r\nclassed as prehistoric. But as we have seen, a _dun_ does not mean a\r\nmotte, or even a hill, but an enclosure. Naas was part of the share\r\nwhich fell to the famous Anglo-Norman leader, Maurice FitzGerald, and\r\nthe earthworks are quite of the Norman pattern;[1093] a good motte,\r\nditched and banked, with trace of a small bailey attached. The terrace\r\nround the flank of the motte may be no older than the modern buildings\r\non the summit.[1094] [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nNAVAN, Meath.--The _Song_ says Navan was given to Jocelin de Nangle,\r\nand it is known that the castle of the Nangles was at Navan. A lofty\r\nmotte, with a very small semilunar platform below, formed by broadening\r\nout a part of the counterscarp bank of the ditch. (Compare Kilbixie.)\r\n[B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nNOBBER, Meath (_Cal._, i., 104).--A castle of Hugh de Lacy. A motte,\r\nwith traces of a breastwork round the top, and wing banks running down\r\nto what remains of the bailey on the S. Two curious little terraces on\r\nthe N. side of the motte. No masonry. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nRATH' (_Cal._, i., 95).--This castle, evidently one of the most\r\nimportant in Ulster, but hitherto unidentified, has been shown by Mr\r\nOrpen to be the famous castle of Dundrum, Down.[1095] This castle is\r\nsituated on a natural motte of rock, no doubt scarped by art, with a\r\ndeep ditch cut through the rock, and a bailey attached. The top of the\r\nmotte contains a small ward fortified in stone, and a round keep. It\r\nis very doubtful whether this keep is as old as the time of John de\r\nCourcy, to whom the castle is popularly attributed; for the round keep\r\nwithout buttresses hardly appears in England before the reign of Henry\r\nIII. [E. S. A.]\r\n\r\nRATHWIRE, Meath.--Rathwire was the portion of Robert de Lacy (_Song_,\r\n3150), and a castle was built here by Hugh de Lacy.[1096] There is\r\na motte and bailey, with considerable remains of foundations in the\r\nbailey, and one wing bank going up the motte. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n*RATOUTH, Meath, now RATOATH (_Cal._, i., 110).--A castle of Hugh de\r\nLacy. There is \"a conspicuous mount\" near the church, about which there\r\nis a legend that Malachy, first king of all Ireland, held a convention\r\nof states (Lewis). It is marked in the map.\r\n\r\n*ROKEREL (_Cal._, i., 81).--Unidentified.\r\n\r\nROSCREA, Tipperary (_Cal._, i., 81).--A motte and bretasche were\r\nbuilt here in King John's reign, as is recorded in an inquisition of\r\n29 Henry III. (_Cal._, i., 412). There is no motte now at Roscrea,\r\nbut an Edwardian castle with mural towers and no keep; a 14th-century\r\ngatehouse tower. Here we have a proved instance of a motte completely\r\nswept away by an Edwardian transformation.[1097] [E. S. A.]\r\n\r\nSKREEN, Meath.--Giraldus mentions the castle of Adam de Futepoi, and\r\nas Skreen was his barony, his castle must have been at Skreen. In the\r\ngrounds of the modern castellated house at Skreen there is a motte,\r\n11 feet high (probably lowered), with a terrace round its flank; some\r\nslight traces of a bailey. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nSLANE, Meath.--The _Song_ relates the erection of a motte by Richard\r\nthe Fleming: \"un mot fist cil jeter pur ses enemis grever.\"[1098] It\r\nalso tells of its destruction by the Irish, but does not give its\r\nname, which is supplied by the _Annals of Ulster_. Probably Richard\r\nthe Fleming restored his motte after its destruction, for there is\r\nstill a motte on the hill of Slane, with a large annular bailey,[1099]\r\nquite large enough for the \"100 foreigners, besides women and children\r\nand horses,\" who were in it when it was taken. The motte has still a\r\nslight breastwork round the top. The modern castle of the Marquis of\r\nConyngham, below, incorporates half a round tower of 13th-century work,\r\nbelonging no doubt to the stone castle which succeeded the motte.[1100]\r\n[B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nTHURLES, Tipperary (Dorles, _Cal._, i., 81).--A castle of Theobald\r\nWalter. Thurles Castle has a late keep with trefoil windows, and\r\naccording to Grose was built by the Earl of Ormond in 1328. From\r\ninformation on the spot it appears that there used to be a motte in the\r\ngardens behind the castle; mentioned also by Lewis. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nTIBRAGHNY, or TIPPERAGHNY, Kilkenny (_Gir._, i., 386; _Cal._, i.,\r\n19).--Granted to William de Burgh in 1200; built by John in 1185.[1101]\r\nA motte, with ditch and bank, and some trace of a half-moon bailey to\r\nthe north. About 200 yards away is the stone castle, a late keep with\r\nogee windows. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nTIMAHOE, Queen's Co. (_Gir._, i., 356).--Built by Hugh de Lacy for\r\nMeiler Fitz Henry. A motte, called the Rath of Ballynaclogh, half a\r\nmile west of the village. The bailey, the banks and ditches of which\r\nseem remarkably well preserved, is almost circular, but the motte is\r\nplaced at its edge, not concentrically. There are wing-banks running up\r\nthe motte. Near it are the ruins of a stone castle built in Elizabeth's\r\nreign (Grose). [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nTRIM, Meath.--The _Song_ tells of the erection of this castle by Hugh\r\nde Lacy, and how in his absence the _meysun_ (the keep--doubtless\r\nwooden) was burnt by the Irish, and the _mot_ levelled with the ground.\r\nThis express evidence that the first castle at Trim had a motte is\r\nof great value, because there is no motte there now. The castle was\r\nrestored by Raymond le Gros,[1102] but so quickly that the present\r\nremarkable keep can hardly have been built at that date.[1103] [B. T.\r\nS.]\r\n\r\n*TRISTERDERMOT (_Gir._, v., 356).--Castle of Walter de Riddlesford.\r\nTristerdermot is now Castledermot; there used to be a _rath_ of some\r\nkind here close to the town. But Mr Orpen inclines to believe that\r\nthe castle Giraldus alludes to was at Kilkea, another manor of De\r\nRiddlesford's, where there is a motte, near the modern castle. \"In the\r\nearly English versions of the _Expugnatio_ Kilcae is put instead of\r\nTristerdermot as the place where Walter de Riddlesford's castle was\r\nbuilt.\"[1104]\r\n\r\n*TYPERMESAN (_Cal._, i., 110).--Mr Orpen writes that this name occurs\r\nagain in a list of churches in the deanery of Fore, which includes\r\nall the parish names in the half barony of Fore, except Oldcastle and\r\nKilleagh. He suspects that Typermesan is now known as Oldcastle, \"where\r\nthere is a remarkably well-preserved motte and raised bailey.\"[1105]\r\n\r\nWATERFORD (_Cal._, i., 89).--We are not told whether Strongbow built a\r\ncastle here when he took the town from the Ostmen in 1170. The castle\r\nis not mentioned till 1215, when it was granted by John to Thomas\r\nFitz-Antony. Waterford was a walled town in 1170, and had a tower\r\ncalled Reginald's Tower, which seems to have been the residence of\r\nthe two Danish chieftains, as they were taken prisoners there. Here\r\ntoo, Henry II. imprisoned Fitz Stephen.[1106] It is possible that this\r\ntower, as Mr Orpen supposes,[1107] may have been considered as the\r\ncastle of Waterford. But the existing \"Ring tower\" on the line of the\r\nwalls, which is sometimes called Reginald's Tower, is certainly a round\r\nmural tower of the 13th century; there are others of similar masonry on\r\nthe walls. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\n*WEXFORD (_Gir._, v., 314).--Probably built by Maurice Prendergast;\r\nfirst mentioned when taken from his sons in 1176. Mr Orpen writes:\r\n\"The site of Wexford Castle is an artificial mound. Two of the scarped\r\nsides still remain, and the other two are built up above streets. When\r\nrecently laying some drainpipes, the workmen came upon no rock, but\r\nonly made earth.\"\r\n\r\nWICKLOW (_Gir._, i., 298).--Existing when Henry II. left Ireland\r\nin 1173; he gave it to Strongbow. The Black Castle at Wicklow is a\r\nheadland castle; it preserves the motte-and-bailey plan, though there\r\nis no motte, as there is a small triangular inner ward (about thirty\r\npaces each side) several feet higher than the outer bailey, from which\r\nit is separated by a very deep ditch cut through the rock. [B. T. S.]\r\n\r\nWe have here a list of seventy-two castles mentioned in the contemporary\r\nhistory of the Norman invasion. If the list is reduced by omitting\r\nAq'i, Kilmehal, Loske, Rokerel, and Incheleder, which are not yet\r\nidentified, and five castles of which the identification may be\r\nconsidered doubtful, Caherconlish, Croom, Clahull's Castle, Lagelachan,\r\nand Typermesan, sixty-two castles are left, and out of these sixty-two,\r\nfifty-two have or had mottes.[1108] In five cases the place of the\r\nmotte is taken by a natural rock, helped by art; but as the idea and\r\nplan are the same it is legitimately classed as the same type.\r\n\r\nThis list might easily have been enlarged by the addition of many\r\ncastles mentioned in the various Irish annals as having been built\r\nby the Normans. But this would have involved the identification of\r\na number of difficult names, a labour to which the writer's limited\r\nknowledge of Irish topography was not equal. The greater number of\r\nthese sites have now been identified by Mr Orpen, and to his papers, so\r\nfrequently cited above, we must refer the reader who wishes to study\r\nthe fullest form of the argument sketched in these pages.\r\n\r\nOne can easily sympathise with the feelings of those who, having\r\nalways looked upon these mottes as monuments of ancient Ireland, are\r\nloath to part with them to the Norman robber. Many of us have had\r\nsimilar feelings about the mottes of England, some of which we had been\r\ntaught to regard as the work of that heroic pair, Edward the Elder and\r\nEthelfleda. But these feelings evaporated when we came to realise that\r\nit would have been highly unpatriotic in these founders of the British\r\nempire to have built little castles for their own personal safety,\r\ninstead of building cities which were \"to shelter all the folk,\" in the\r\nwords of Ethelfleda's charter to Worcester. In like manner, wretched as\r\nwere the intertribal wars of Ireland, it would have been a disgrace to\r\nthe Irish chieftains if they had consulted solely their own defence by\r\nbuilding these little strongholds for their personal use.\r\n\r\nThe Irish motte-castles furnish us with interesting proof that this\r\ntype of castle was commonly used, not only as late as the reign\r\nof Henry II., but also in the reigns of his sons, Richard I. and\r\nJohn;[1109] that is to say, at a time when castle-building in stone was\r\nreceiving remarkable developments at the hands of Richard I. and Philip\r\nAugustus of France. This, however, need not surprise us, since we know\r\nthat as late as 1242, Henry III. was building a motte and wooden\r\ncastle in the Isle of Rhé, at the mouth of the Garonne.[1110] But those\r\nwho imagine that the Normans built stone castles everywhere in England,\r\nWales, and Ireland, will have to reconsider their views.\r\n\r\n_Note._--Mr Orpen's work on _Ireland under the Normans_ did not appear\r\nuntil too late for use in this chapter. The reader is referred to it\r\nfor a more careful tracing of the history and archæology of the Norman\r\nsettlements in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSTONE CASTLES OF THE NORMAN PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be a surprise to some of our readers to learn how very few stone\r\ncastles there are in England which can certainly be ascribed to the\r\nfirst period of the Norman Conquest, that is to the 11th century. When\r\nwe have named the Tower of London, Colchester, the recently excavated\r\nfoundations of the remarkable keep at Pevensey, and perhaps the ruined\r\nkeep of Bramber, we have completed the list, as far as our present\r\nknowledge goes, though possibly future excavations may add a few\r\nothers.[1111]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that so small a number of instances furnishes a very\r\nslender basis for generalisations as to the characteristics of early\r\nNorman keeps, if we ask in what respect they differed from those of the\r\n12th century. But it is the object of this chapter to suggest research,\r\nrather than to lay down conclusions. The four early instances mentioned\r\nshould be compared with the earliest keeps of France, the country where\r\nthe pattern was developed. This has not yet been done in any serious\r\nway, nor does the present writer pretend to the knowledge which would\r\nbe necessary for such a comparison.[1112] But data exist, which, if\r\nthey were used in the right way, would greatly add to our knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we have a list of the castles built by Fulk Nerra,\r\nCount of Anjou, at the end of the 10th and the beginning of the 11th\r\ncentury, during his life-long struggle with the Counts of Blois for\r\nthe possession of Touraine. This list may be regarded as authentic,\r\nas it is given by his grandson, Fulk Rechin, in the remarkable\r\nhistorical fragment which he has bequeathed to us.[1113] The list is\r\nas follows:--_In Touraine_: Langeais, Chaumont-sur-Loire, Montrésor,\r\nSt Maure. _In Poitou_: Mirabeau (N.W. of Poitiers), Montcontour,\r\nFaye-la-Vineuse, Musterolum (Montreuil-Bonnin), Passavent, Maulevrier.\r\n_In Anjou_: Baugé, Chateau-Gontier, Durtal. \"Et multa alia,\" adds\r\nFulk's grandson. Nine of these others are mentioned by the chroniclers:\r\nMontbazon, Semblançay, Montboyau, St Florent-le-Vieil, Chateaufort\r\nnear Langeais, Chérament, Montrevault, Montfaucon, and Mateflon.\r\nMany of these were undoubtedly wooden castles, with wooden keeps on\r\nmottes.[1114] In many other cases the ancient fabric has been replaced\r\nby a building of the Renaissance period. Whether any remains of stone\r\ndonjons built by Fulk Nerra exist at any of these places except at\r\nLangeais, the writer has been unable to find out; probably Langeais\r\nis the only one; but French archæologists are agreed that the ruined\r\ntower which stands on the ridge above the 15th-century castle of\r\nLangeais is the work of this count,[1115] a venerable fragment of a\r\n10th-century keep.[1116]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately only two sides of this tower and the foundations of\r\nthe other sides remain. The walls are only 3 feet 6 inches thick,\r\ncontrasting strikingly with the castles of the 12th and 13th centuries,\r\nwhere the usual thickness is 10 feet, which is often exceeded. This\r\npoints to a date before any great improvement had taken place in\r\nassaulting-machinery. The masonry is what French architects call\r\n_petit appareil_, very small stones, but regularly coursed. There is\r\nno herring-bone work. The buttresses, of which there are five on the\r\nfront, certainly suggest a later date, from the size of the ashlar with\r\nwhich they are faced, and from their considerable projection (3 feet on\r\nthe entrance wall, 2 on the front). There is no sign of a forebuilding.\r\nThere are only two storeys above the basement. The floors have been\r\nsupported on ledges, not on vaults. The doorway, a plain round arch,\r\nwith bar-holes, is on the first floor;[1117] it is now only a few feet\r\nabove the ground, but probably the basement has been partially filled\r\nup with rubbish. The first storey is quite windowless in the walls\r\nwhich remain. There are no fireplaces nor any loopholes in these two\r\nfragments. In the second storey there are three rather small windows\r\nand one very large one;[1118] they are round arched, have no splay, and\r\ntheir voussoirs are of narrow stones alternated with tiles. In these\r\ndetails they resemble the Early Romanesque, which in England we call\r\nAnglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nThe Tower of London and Colchester keep are some seventy or eighty\r\nyears later than that of Langeais, and if we attempt to compare them,\r\nwe must bear in mind that Langeais was the work of a noble who was\r\nalways in the throes of an acute struggle with a powerful rival,\r\nwhereas the Tower and Colchester Castle were built by a king who had\r\nreached a position of power and wealth beyond that of any neighbouring\r\nsovereign.[1119] Langeais is but a small affair compared with these\r\nother two keeps. The larger area,[1120] thicker walls, the angle towers\r\nwith their provision of stairways, the splayed windows [of Colchester],\r\nthe fireplaces, the chapels with round apses, the mural gallery [of the\r\nTower] cannot be definitely pronounced to be instances of development\r\nunless we have other instances than Langeais to compare with them.\r\nDe Caumont mentions Chateau du Pin (Calvados), Lithaire (Manche),\r\nBeaugency-sur-Loire, Nogent-le-Rotrou (Eure et Loire), Tour de l'Islot\r\n(Seine et Oise), St Suzanne (Mayenne), and Tour de Broue (Charente\r\nInf.), as instances of keeps of the 11th century.[1121] These should\r\nbe carefully examined by the student of castle architecture, and De\r\nCaumont's statements as to their date should be verified. Not having\r\nhad the opportunity of doing this, we will only ask what features the\r\nkeeps of Langeais, London, and Colchester have in common, which may\r\nserve as marks of an earlier date than the 12th century.[1122] The\r\nsquare or oblong form and the entrance on the first floor are common\r\nto all three, but also to the keeps of the first three-quarters of\r\nthe 12th century. The absence of a forebuilding is probably an early\r\nsign,[1123] and so is the extensive use of tiles.[1124] The chapel\r\nwith a round apse which projects externally only occurs in the keeps\r\nof London and Colchester, and in the ruins of Pevensey keep.[1125] The\r\nabsence of a plinth is believed by Enlart to be an early token.[1126]\r\nBut Colchester has a plinth and so has the Tower. It is, however,\r\nvery possible that in both cases the plinth is a later addition; at\r\nColchester it is of different stone to the rest of the building, and\r\nmay belong to the repairs of Henry II., who was working on this castle\r\nin 1169; while the Tower has undergone so many alterations in the\r\ncourse of its eight hundred years of existence that it is difficult to\r\nsay whether the rudimentary plinth which it still possesses is original\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nWide-jointed masonry is generally recognised by architectural students\r\nas a mark of the early Norman style. Even this is a test which may\r\nsometimes deceive; certain kinds of ashlar are very liable to weather\r\nat the edges, and when the wall has been pointed at a comparatively\r\nrecent period, a false appearance of wide joints is produced.\r\nMoreover, there are instances of wide-jointed masonry throughout the\r\n12th century. The use of rubble instead of ashlar is common at all\r\ndates, and depends no doubt on local conditions, the local provision\r\nof stone, or the affluence or poverty of the castle-builder. We are\r\nprobably justified in laying down as a general rule that the dimensions\r\nof the ashlar stones increase as the Middle Ages advance. There is a\r\ngradual transition from the _petit appareil_ of Fulk Nerra's castle\r\nto the large blocks of well-set stone which were used in the 15th\r\ncentury.[1127] But this law is liable to many exceptions, and cannot be\r\nrelied upon as a test of date unless other signs are present. The Tower\r\nof London is built of Kentish rag; Colchester keep of small cement\r\nstones (septaria), which whether they are re-used Roman stones or not,\r\nresemble very much in size the masonry of Langeais. It is of course\r\nunnecessary to say to anyone who is in the least acquainted with Norman\r\narchitecture that all Norman walls of ashlar are of the core-and-facing\r\nkind, an internal and an external shell of ashlar, filled up with\r\nrubble; a technique which was inherited from Roman times in Gaul, but\r\nwhich was not followed by the Anglo-Saxons.[1128]\r\n\r\nThe presence or absence of fireplaces and chimneys is not a test of\r\ndate. Colchester is certainly an early keep,[1129] but it is well\r\nprovided with fireplaces which appear to be original. These fireplaces\r\nhave not proper chimneys, but only holes in the wall a little above the\r\nfireplace. But this rudimentary form of chimney is found as late as\r\nHenry II.'s keep at Orford, and there is said to be documentary mention\r\nof a proper chimney as early as 816 in the monastery of St Gall.[1130]\r\nThe entire absence of fireplaces is no proof of early date, for in\r\nHenry II.'s keep at the Peak in Derbyshire, the walls of which are\r\nalmost perfect (except for their ashlar coats) there are no fireplaces\r\nat all, nor are there any in the 13th-century keep of Pembroke. It is\r\npossible that in these cases a free standing fireplace in the middle\r\nof the room, with a chimney carried up to the roof, was used. Such a\r\nfireplace is described by the poet, Chrestien of Troyes, but no example\r\nis known to exist.[1131]\r\n\r\nBut apart from details, if we look at the general plan of these four\r\nearly stone castles, we shall see that it is exactly similar. It is\r\nthe keep-and-bailey plan, the plan which prevailed from the 10th to\r\nthe 13th century, and was not even superseded by the introduction of\r\nthe keepless castle in the latter century.[1132] The motte-and-bailey\r\ntype was of course only another version of the keep-and-bailey. In\r\nthis primitive type of castle the all-important thing was the keep or\r\ndonjon.[1133] Besides the donjon there was little else but a rampart\r\nand ditch. \"Until the middle of the 12th century, and in the simpler\r\nexamples of the epochs which followed, the donjon may be said to\r\nconstitute in itself the whole castle.\"[1134] Piper states that up\r\nto the time of the Crusades German castles do not seem to have been\r\nfurnished with mural towers.[1135] Köhler, whose work treats of French\r\nand English castles as well as German, says that mural towers did\r\nnot become general till the second half of the 12th century.[1136]\r\nNevertheless, as it is highly probable that the baileys of castles were\r\ndefended at first with only wooden ramparts on earthen banks, even\r\nwhen the donjon was of stone, it is not unlikely that mural towers of\r\nwood may have existed at an earlier period than these writers suppose.\r\nIt is, however, in favour of the general absence of mural towers that\r\nthe word _turris_, even in 12th-century records, invariably means the\r\n_keep_, as though no other towers existed.[1137]\r\n\r\nThat the baileys of some of the most important castles in England\r\nhad only these wooden and earthen defences, even as late as the 13th\r\ncentury, can be amply proved from the _Close Rolls_.[1138] Colchester\r\nCastle had only a timber wall on the banks of its bailey as late as\r\n1215, and in 1219 this _palicium_ was blown down and an order issued\r\nfor its reconstruction.[1139]\r\n\r\nThe arrangements in the stone donjons were probably the same as those\r\nwe have already described when writing of the wooden ones.[1140] The\r\nbasement was the storehouse for provisions,[1141] the first floor was\r\ngenerally the guardhouse, the second the habitation, of the lord and\r\nlady. Where there were three or four storeys, the arrangements varied,\r\nand the finest rooms are often found on the third floor. An oratory was\r\nprobably an invariable feature, though it cannot always be detected in\r\nruined keeps. One of Mr Clark's most pronounced mistakes was his idea\r\nthat these keeps were merely towers of refuge used only in time of\r\nwar.[1142] History abounds with evidence that they were the permanent\r\nresidences of the nobles of the 11th and 12th centuries. The cooking,\r\nas a rule, was carried on in a separate building, of which there are\r\nremains in some places.[1143]\r\n\r\nOccasionally we find a variant of the keep-and-bailey type, which\r\nwe may call the gatehouse keep. The most remarkable instance of\r\nthis kind in England is Exeter, which appears never to have had any\r\nkeep but the primitive gatehouse, undoubtedly the work of Baldwin de\r\nMoeles, the first builder of the castle. In Normandy, De Caumont gives\r\nseveral instances of gatehouse keeps. Plessis-Grimoult (which has been\r\nvisited by the writer) has a fragment of a gatehouse tower, but has\r\nalso a mural tower on the line of the walls; as the castle was ruined\r\nand abandoned in 1047, these remains must be of early date.[1144] The\r\ngatehouse keep is probably an economical device for combining a citadel\r\nwith the defence of the weakest part of the castle.\r\n\r\nWe must pass on to the keeps of Henry I.[1145] There is only one\r\nin England which authentic history gives to his time, that of\r\nRochester.[1146] But the chronicler Robert de Torigny[1147] has\r\nfortunately given us a list of the keeps and castles built by Henry in\r\nNormandy, and though many of these are now destroyed, and others in\r\nruins, a certain number are left, which, taken along with Rochester,\r\nmay give us an idea of the type of keep built in Henry I.'s time. The\r\nkeeps attributed by Robert to Henry I. are Arques, Gisors, Falaise,\r\nArgentan, Exmes, Domfront, Ambrières, Vire, Waure, Vernon, Evreux,\r\nAlençon, St Jean, and Coutances. How many of these survive we cannot\r\npositively say;[1148] we can only speak of those we have seen (Falaise,\r\nDomfront, and Gisors),[1149] and of Arques, described by M. Deville\r\nin his _Histoire du Chateau d'Arques_, by M. Viollet le Duc in his\r\ntreatise on Donjons,[1150] and by Mr G. T. Clark.[1151]\r\n\r\nSpeaking under correction, as a prolonged study of the keeps in\r\nNormandy was impossible to the writer, we should say that there is no\r\nvery striking difference to be observed between the keeps of Henry I.\r\nand those built by his father. The development of the forebuilding\r\nseems to be the most important change, if indeed we are justified\r\nin assuming that the 11th-century keeps never had it; its remains\r\ncan be seen at Arques, Falaise,[1152] Domfront, and Rochester. At\r\nArques and Falaise the doorway is on the second floor, which is an\r\ninnovation, a new attempt to solve the difficulty of defending the\r\nentrance. The first floor at Arques could only be entered by a trap\r\nfrom the second floor; at Falaise there is a stone stair from one to\r\nthe other. Rochester is entered from the first floor. The basement\r\nstoreys of Arques, Falaise, and Domfront are quite unlit; at the Tower\r\nthe basement has had a number of loopholes, and the angular heads of\r\nthose which remain suggest that they are at least copied from original\r\nlights. The main floors in Henry I.'s keeps are always of wood, but\r\nthis was not because vaulting was then unknown, because the crypt,\r\nsub-crypt, and chapel of the Tower are vaulted, not to speak of many\r\nearly churches.[1153] The four keeps mentioned have all three storeys,\r\nthus not exceeding Colchester in height;[1154] the Tower has now four\r\nstoreys, but a good authority has remarked that the fourth storey has\r\nnot improbably been made by dividing the third.\r\n\r\nNo marked advance is observable in the masonry of these keeps. Arques\r\nis built of _petit appareil_; Falaise of small stones in herring-bone\r\nwork; Domfront of very small stones rudely coursed; Rochester of\r\nKentish rag mixed with flint rubble. Both Falaise and Domfront have\r\nplinths of superior masonry, but there is always the possibility\r\nthat these plinths are later additions. The voussoirs of the arches\r\nat Falaise, Domfront, and Rochester are larger than the rag or tile\r\nvoussoirs which are used at Colchester, the Tower, and Langeais. At\r\nRochester and Arques provision is made for carrying the water-supply\r\nfrom the well in the basement to the upper floors, a provision of\r\nwhich there is no trace in the older keeps.[1155]\r\n\r\nAs Robert de Monte says that Henry I. built many castles in England as\r\nwell as in Normandy, we naturally ask what other English keeps besides\r\nRochester may be assigned to him. It appears to the writer that Corfe\r\nand Norwich keeps may very likely be his. Both were royal castles in\r\nhis time, and both were originally wooden castles on mottes.[1156]\r\nBoth these castles have forebuildings, and neither of them have\r\nfloors supported on vaults.[1157] Corfe has very superior masonry, of\r\nlarger stones than those used in the keeps known to be Henry I.'s,\r\nbut wide-jointed. At Norwich only a very small piece of the original\r\nashlar is left. Corfe is extremely severe in all its details, but quite\r\ncorresponds to work of Henry I.'s reign.[1158] Norwich has a great deal\r\nof decoration, more advanced in style than that to be seen at Falaise,\r\nbut still consistent with the first half of the 12th century. Neither\r\nkeep has the least sign of Transition Norman, such as we seldom fail to\r\nfind in the keeps of Henry II. Moreover, neither of them figure in the\r\n_Pipe Rolls_ of Henry II., except for repairs; and as Stephen in his\r\nharassed reign can hardly have had any money for building stone keeps,\r\nwe may with some confidence ascribe these two keeps to Henry I.\r\n\r\nA few words should be given to the castle of Gisors, which contains\r\nin itself an epitome of castle history. The first castle, built by\r\nWilliam Rufus in 1096, was undoubtedly a wooden castle on a motte,\r\nwith a stockaded bailey below it; certain portions of the present\r\nbailey walls rest on earthen banks, which probably belonged to the\r\noriginal castle, and show what a much smaller affair it was than the\r\npresent one. Henry I., Robert de Monte tells us, strengthened this\r\ncastle with a keep. Probably this was the shell wall which now crowns\r\nthe motte; the smallness of the masonry (stones about 5 inches high,\r\nrudely dressed and coursed) and the slight projection of the buttresses\r\n(9 inches) agree with much of the work of his time. There would be a\r\nwooden tower inside.[1159] The chemise or shell wall is pierced by\r\nloopholes, a very unusual arrangement; they are round arched, and of\r\nvery rude voussoirs.[1160] Inside this shell there is a decagonal\r\ntower, called the Tower of Thomas à Becket, which is almost certainly\r\nthe work of Henry II.,[1161] as its name would indicate; the chapel of\r\nSt Thomas is close to it. A stair turret of the 15th century has been\r\nadded to this keep; its original entrance was, as usual, a door on the\r\nfirst floor, but a basement entrance was built afterwards, probably\r\nin the 13th century. Philip Augustus, after he had taken this castle\r\nfrom John, added to it one of the round keeps which had then become the\r\nfashion, and subsequent enlargements of the bailey converted it into a\r\n\"concentric\" castle, of which the motte now forms the centre.\r\n\r\nThere is one keep which is known to be of the reign of Stephen, though\r\nnot built by him, that of Carlisle, built by David, King of Scotland,\r\nin 1136,[1162] a time when he thought his hold on the four northern\r\ncounties of England was secure, little reckoning on the true character\r\nof his great-nephew, Henry, son of Matilda. There is no advance to be\r\nseen in this keep on those of Henry I., except that the walls are faced\r\nwith ashlar. The vaulting of the basement is pronounced by Mr Clark to\r\nbe very evidently a late insertion.[1163]\r\n\r\nWith the reign of Henry II. a new era opens as regards the documentary\r\nhistory of our ancient castles, because the _Pipe Rolls_ of that king's\r\nreign have most fortunately been preserved.[1164] These contain the\r\nsheriff's accounts for money spent on the building or repair of the\r\nking's castles, and are simply invaluable for the history of castle\r\narchitecture. The following is a list of the keeps which the _Pipe\r\nRolls_ show to have been built or finished by Henry II.:--\r\n\r\n Scarborough, built between 1157 and 1174.  Tower\r\n Windsor,       \"      \"    1161  \"  1177.  Shell wall\r\n Orford,        \"      \"    1165  \"  1172.  Tower\r\n Bridgenorth,   \"      \"    1166  \"  1173.  Tower\r\n Newcastle,     \"      \"    1167  \"  1177.  Tower\r\n Bowes,         \"      \"    1171  \"  1187.  Tower\r\n Richmond,      \"      \"    1171  \"  1174.  Tower\r\n Chilham,       \"      \"    1171  \"  1173.  Tower\r\n Peak,          \"      \"    1172  \"  1176.  Tower\r\n Canterbury,    \"      \"    1172  \"  1174.  Tower\r\n Arundel,       \"      \"    1176  \"  1182.  Shell wall\r\n Tickhill,      \"      \"    1178  \"  1181.  Tower\r\n\r\nThe dates given here must be taken as only roughly accurate, as owing\r\nto the meagreness of the entries in the _Pipe Rolls_, it is not always\r\ncertain whether the expenses were for the great tower or for other\r\nbuildings. The list by no means includes all the work which Henry II.\r\ndid on his English castles, for he was a great builder; but a good\r\ndeal of his work seems to have been the substitution of stone walls\r\nwith mural towers, for wooden stockades, and our list comprises all\r\nthe cases in which it is clear that the keep was the work of this\r\nking.[1165] We confine our attention to the keeps, because though mural\r\ntowers of stone began to be added to the walls of baileys during Henry\r\nII.'s reign (a detail which must have greatly altered the general\r\nappearance of castles), it is certain that the keep was still the most\r\nimportant part, and the residence of the king or noble whenever he\r\nvisited the castle.\r\n\r\nSeven out of the ten tower keeps are built on precisely the same plan\r\nas those of Henry I. The chief advance is in the masonry. All the tower\r\nkeeps of Henry II., except Dover, Chilham, and Canterbury, are or have\r\nbeen cased with good ashlar, of stones somewhat larger in size than\r\nthose used by Henry I. The same may be said of the shell walls (namely,\r\nWindsor and Arundel); it is interesting to note that Henry II. still\r\nused this elementary form of citadel, which consisted merely of a wall\r\nround the top of a motte, with wooden buildings inside.[1166] In three\r\ncases out of the ten tower keeps, Newcastle, Bowes, and Richmond,\r\nthe basement storey is vaulted, which does not occur in the older\r\nkeeps.[1167] Yet such important castles as Scarborough, Dover, and\r\nCanterbury are without this provision against fire. None of these keeps\r\nappear to have more than three storeys above the basement.[1168] None\r\nof the entrances to the keeps (except Tickhill) have any portcullis\r\ngrooves,[1169] nor any special contrivances for defence, except at\r\nCanterbury, where the entrance (on the first floor) takes two turns at\r\nright angles before reaching the hall to which it leads.[1170] There\r\nare nearly always in the keeps of Henry II. some signs of Transition\r\nNorman in the details, such as the nook shafts at the angles of the\r\ntowers of Scarborough and the Peak, certain arches at Canterbury, the\r\nTransition capitals used at Newcastle, and the filleted string round\r\nthe outside of Bowes.\r\n\r\nBut we have yet to speak of three keeps of Henry II.'s reign which\r\nare on a different plan to all the others, and which point to coming\r\nchanges--Chilham, Orford, and Tickhill.[1171] Chilham is an octagonal\r\ntower of three storeys, with a square annexe on one side, which\r\nappears to be original. Orford is polygonal outside, round inside.\r\nOrford indeed is one of the most extraordinary keeps to be seen\r\nanywhere, and we must regard it as an experiment, and an experiment\r\nwhich appears never to have been repeated.[1172] Instead of the usual\r\nNorman buttresses, this polygonal keep has three buttress towers,\r\nplaced between every four of the outer faces, 22 feet wide, and 12\r\nfeet in projection.[1173] Tickhill, however, the last keep he built,\r\nis decagonal. The object of the polygonal tower was to deflect the\r\nmissiles thrown from siege engines, and the round tower was evidently\r\nconsidered an improvement on the polygonal for this purpose, as it\r\nsubsequently supplanted the polygonal type. It is therefore rather\r\nremarkable that Henry II. built both these keeps in the second decade\r\nof his reign, and afterwards went on building square keeps like his\r\npredecessors. We have seen, however, that he built at least one\r\npolygonal tower in Normandy, that of Gisors. We must bear in mind that\r\nthe Norman and Angevine frontier was the theatre of the continuous\r\nstruggle of Henry II. with the French kings, Louis VII. and Philip\r\nAugustus, and that it is here that we must expect the greatest\r\ndevelopments in military architecture.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, we may say that just as there was comparatively\r\nlittle change in armour during the 12th century until the end of Henry\r\nII.'s reign, so there was comparatively little change in military\r\narchitecture during the same period. But great changes took place\r\ntowards the end of the 12th century. One of these changes was a great\r\nimprovement in missile engines; the trébuchet was one of the most\r\nimportant of these. It could throw much heavier stones than the largest\r\ncatapult, and could take a more accurate aim.[1174] These new engines\r\nwere useful for defence as well as attack, and this affected the\r\narchitecture of castles, because flat roofs covered with lead, on which\r\nmachines could be placed, were now substituted for the former sloping\r\nroofs.[1175] There are several payments for lead for roofing castles\r\nin the _Pipe Rolls_ of Henry II., the earliest being in 1166. In the\r\nreigns of John and Henry III. the mention of lead for roofing becomes\r\nmuch more frequent.[1176]\r\n\r\nHitherto, in the defence of keeps, reliance had mainly been placed upon\r\ntheir passive strength, though not so entirely as has been commonly\r\nassumed, since it was always the practice to shoot with arrows from the\r\nbattlements round the roof of the tower. But not only was the fighting\r\nstrength of the keep increased by the trébuchet, but the introduction\r\nof the crossbow gave it a defensive arm of the greatest importance.\r\nThe crossbow had been known to the Romans, and was used in the early\r\npart of the 12th century, but it was forbidden by the second Lateran\r\nCouncil in 1139 as a weapon hateful to God.[1177] This prohibition\r\nseems actually to have been effective, as William the Breton says\r\nexpressly that the crossbow was unknown to the French before the wars\r\nof Richard I. and Philip Augustus.[1178] Richard learned the use of it\r\nin the third crusade.[1179] But to use the crossbow in the defence of\r\nbuildings it was necessary to construct special loopholes for shooting,\r\nsplayed downwards externally, so that it was possible to aim from them.\r\nUp till this time the loopholes of castles had been purely for light\r\nand not for shooting; anyone may see that it is impossible to take aim\r\nthrough an immensely thick wall unless there is a downward splay to\r\nincrease the field of vision. William the Breton tells us that Richard\r\nbuilt windows for crossbows to his towers, and this is the first\r\nmention we have of them.[1180]\r\n\r\nFrom this time defensive loopholes become common in castles, and take\r\nvarious fanciful forms, as well as the commoner ones of the circle,\r\nsquare, or triangle at the base of the loop. The _cross loophole_,\r\nwhich does not appear till the latter quarter of the 13th century, is\r\nexplained by Viollet le Duc as an ingenious way of allowing three or\r\nfour archers to fire in a volley.[1181] But up to the present time very\r\nlittle study has been given to this subject, and we must be content to\r\nleave the question for future observation to settle.[1182]\r\n\r\nThe crossbowmen not only required splayed loopholes, but also niches,\r\nlarge enough to accommodate at least three men, so that a continuous\r\ndischarge of darts (quarrells) might be kept up. Any defensive loop\r\nwhich really means work will have a niche like this behind it. These\r\nniches had the defect of seriously weakening the wall.\r\n\r\nAnother innovation introduced by Richard I. was that of stone\r\nmachicolations, or _hurdicia_.[1183] Whether wooden galleries round the\r\ntops of walls, with holes for dropping down stones, boiling-water, or\r\npitch on the heads of the besiegers had not been used from the earliest\r\ntimes, is regarded by Köhler as extremely doubtful.[1184] They were\r\ncertainly used by the Romans, and may even be seen clearly figured on\r\nthe Assyrian monuments. In the Bayeux Tapestry, the picture of Bayeux\r\nCastle shows the stockade on top of the motte crested with something\r\nextremely like hurdicia. Yet the writer has found no authentic\r\nmention of them before the end of the 12th century.[1185] The stone\r\nmachicolations built by Richard round his keep of Chateau Gaillard are\r\nof an unusual type, which was only rarely imitated.[1186] But from\r\nthis time wooden hurdicia became universal, to judge from the numerous\r\norders for timber for _hoarding_ castles and town walls in the _Close\r\nRolls_ of the first half of the 13th century. Towards the middle of the\r\n13th century stone brackets for the support of wooden hurdicia began\r\nto be used; they may still be seen in the great keep of Coucy, which\r\nwas begun in 1230. But machicolations entirely of stone, supported on\r\ndouble or triple rows of brackets, do not become common till the 14th\r\ncentury.[1187]\r\n\r\nThe greatest architectural change witnessed at the end of the 12th\r\ncentury was the victory of the round keep over the square. Round towers\r\nwere built by the Romans as mural towers, but the universal type of\r\nmediæval keep appears to have been the square or oblong, until towards\r\nthe end of the 12th century.[1188] The polygonal keep was probably a\r\ntransitional form; we have seen that Henry II.'s polygonal keep at\r\nOrford was begun as early as 1165. Many experiments seem to have been\r\nmade at the end of the 12th century, such as the addition of a stone\r\nprow to the weakest side of a keep, to enable it better to resist\r\nshowers of missiles. Richard I.'s keep at Chateau Gaillard is a round\r\nkeep with a solid prow of this kind. Five-sided keeps are said to be\r\nnot uncommon on the left bank of the Rhine and in Nassau; this type\r\nwas simply the addition of a prow to a square keep. The only English\r\ninstance known to the writer is that of Mitford, Northumberland, but\r\nthis is merely a five-sided keep, the prow is not solid, as at Chateau\r\nGaillard. The castle of Étampes, whose plan is a quatrefoil, is\r\nassigned by French archæologists to this period of experiment.[1189]\r\nBut the round keep was eventually the type preferred. Philip II.\r\nthought it necessary to add a round keep to the castle of Gisors, after\r\nhe had taken it from John, and he adopted the round keep for all his\r\nnew castles, of which the Louvre was one.[1190]\r\n\r\nAlong with the round keep, ground entrances became common.[1191]\r\nViollet le Duc states that when the French soldiers broke into the\r\ninner ward at Chateau Gaillard the defenders had no time to escape\r\ninto the keep by the narrow stair which led to the first floor, and\r\nconsequently this proud tower was surrendered without a blow; and\r\nthat this event so impressed on Philip's mind the danger of difficult\r\nentrances that he abandoned the old fashion. This may be true, but it\r\nis a pure guess of Le Duc's, as there is nothing whatever to justify\r\nit in William the Breton's circumstantial narrative. It is, however,\r\ncertain that Philip adopted the ground entrance to all his keeps.\r\nIn England we find ground entrances to many round keeps of the 13th\r\ncentury, as at Pembroke; but the older fashion was sometimes retained;\r\nConisburgh, one of the finest keeps in England, has its entrance on the\r\nfirst floor.[1192]\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of the trébuchet, we might expect that the\r\nwalls of keeps would be made very much thicker, and such seems to\r\nhave been the case in France,[1193] but we do not find that it was\r\nthe rule in England.[1194] The lower storeys were now generally\r\ninstead of occasionally vaulted. In the course of the 13th century it\r\nbecame common to vault all the storeys. But in spite of the military\r\nadvantages of the round keep, in its avoidance of angles favourable to\r\nthe battering-ram, and its deflection of missiles, the square keep\r\ncontinued to be built in various parts of both France and England till\r\nquite late in the Middle Ages.[1195] On the Scottish border, square\r\ntowers of the ancient type, with quite Norman decorations, were built\r\nas late as the 15th century.[1196] The advantage of the square tower\r\nwas that it was more roomy inside, and was therefore preferred when the\r\ntower was intended for habitation.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the greatest of all the changes introduced in the\r\n13th century: the keepless castle, in which the keep is done away\r\nwith altogether, and the castle consists of a square or oblong court\r\nsurrounded by a strong wall with massive towers at the angles, and in\r\nlarge castles, in the curtain also.[1197] Usually this inner quadrangle\r\nis encircled with an outer quadrangle of walls and towers, so that this\r\ntype of castle is frequently called the _concentric_. But the castles\r\nof the keepless kind are not invariably concentric; those built by\r\nEdward I. at Conway, Carnarvon, and Flint are not so.[1198] Instead\r\nof a dark and comfortless keep, the royal or noble owner is provided\r\nin this type of castle with a palatial house. In England this house\r\nis frequently attached to the gateway, forming what we may call a\r\ngatehouse palace; good examples may be seen at Beaumaris, Harlech, and\r\nTonbridge.[1199] The gateway itself is always defended by a pair of\r\nmassive towers.\r\n\r\nEdward I. is generally credited with the introduction of this type\r\nof castle into England, but until the _Pipe Rolls_ of Henry III.'s\r\nreign have been carefully examined, we cannot be certain that it was\r\nnot introduced earlier. It was certainly known in Germany fifty years\r\nbefore Edward's accession to the throne, and in France as early as\r\n1231.[1200]\r\n\r\nIt is always supposed that this type of castle was introduced by the\r\nCrusaders from Syria. But when did it make its first appearance in\r\nSyria? This is a point which, we venture to think, has not been yet\r\nsufficiently investigated. We do not believe that it can have existed\r\nin Syria at the time of the third crusade, otherwise Richard I., who is\r\nuniversally acknowledged to have been a first-class military architect,\r\nwould have brought the idea home with him.[1201] Yet his favourite\r\ncastle of Chateau Gaillard, built in accordance with the latest\r\nmilitary science, is in the main a castle of the keep-and-bailey type,\r\nand has even a reminiscence of the motte, in the scarped rock on which\r\nthe keep and inner ward are placed.\r\n\r\nThe new type of keepless castle never entirely displaced the old\r\nkeep-and-bailey type. We have already seen that keeps of the old sort\r\ncontinued to be built till the end of the Middle Ages. Hawarden Castle\r\nhas a good example of a 14th-century round keep; Warkworth a most\r\nremarkable specimen of the 15th, the plan being a square tower with\r\npolygonal turrets set on each face.[1202] In France and Germany also\r\nthe old type appears to have persisted.[1203]\r\n\r\nWe have already trespassed beyond the limits of our subject; but as we\r\noffer this chapter more as a programme of work than as a categorical\r\noutline, we trust it may not be without use to the student who may feel\r\ndisposed to take up this much-neglected subject.\r\n\r\nA few words must yet be said about the state of the law relating to\r\ncastles. Nothing explicit has come down to us on this subject from the\r\n11th century in England, but it is clear that the feudal system which\r\nWilliam introduced, and which required that all lands should revert to\r\nthe king on the death of the holder, forbade the building of any castle\r\nwithout the king's license, and, further, allowed only a life tenure\r\nin each case. The Council of Lillebonne in 1080 had laid it down in\r\nexpress terms that no one should build a castle in Normandy without the\r\npermission of the duke;[1204] and William, after his great victory\r\nover his revolted barons, had enforced the right of garrisoning their\r\ncastles. He was not able to do this in England, while he must have\r\ndesired to check the building of private castles as far as possible. On\r\nthe other hand, he had to face the dilemma that no Norman land-holder\r\nwould be safe in his usurped estates without the shelter of a castle.\r\nIn this situation we have the elements of the civil strife which burst\r\nforth in Stephen's reign, and which was ended by what we may call the\r\nanti-castle policy of Henry II.[1205]\r\n\r\nThe rights secured by this able king were often recklessly sold by his\r\nsuccessors, but in the reign of Henry III. it was evidently illegal\r\neven to fortify an ordinary house with a ditch and stockade without\r\nroyal permission.[1206]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFeudalism was an inevitable phase in the evolution of the Western\r\nnations, and it ought neither to be idealised nor execrated. After\r\nthe break-up of the tribal system the nations of Europe sought refuge\r\nin the forms of imperialism which were devised by Charlemagne, and\r\neven the small and distant island of England strove to move in the\r\nsame direction. But the times were not ripe for centralisation on\r\nso great a scale, and when the system of the Carlovingian Empire\r\ngave way under the inrush of Northmen and Huns, European society\r\nwould have fallen into ruin had it not been for the institutions of\r\nfeudalism. These offered, in place of the old blood bond of the tribe,\r\na social compact which, though itself artificial, was so admirably\r\nadapted to the general need that it was speedily adopted by all the\r\nprogressive nations of Europe. The great merit of feudalism was that it\r\nreplaced the collective responsibility of the tribe by the individual\r\nresponsibility of the man to his lord, and of the lord to his man. In\r\nan age when the decay of mutual trust was the worst evil of society it\r\nlaid stress on individual loyalty, and insisted that personal honour\r\nshould consist in the fulfilment of obligations. Being a system so\r\nwholly personal, its usefulness depended largely on the nature of the\r\nperson in power, and it was therefore liable to great abuses.\r\n\r\nBut it is probable that feudalism worked better on the whole in\r\nEngland than in any other part of Western Europe. The worst evils of\r\nFrench feudalism never appeared in this country, except during the\r\nshort and disastrous reign of Stephen. The strong kings of the Norman\r\nand Plantagenet Houses held in check the turbulence of the barons;\r\nand private war was never allowed to become here, as it was on the\r\nContinent, a standing evil. To follow out this subject would lead us\r\nbeyond the limits of this book, but it is interesting to remember that\r\nnot only the picturesque ruins of our castles, but also the neglected\r\ngreen hillocks of which we have treated in this work, while they point\r\nto the skilful machinery by which the Norman Conquest was riveted on\r\nthe land, bear witness also to something still more important. They\r\ntell of a period of discipline and education through which the English\r\npeople passed, when in spite of much oppression and sometimes even\r\ncruelty, seeds of many noble and useful things were sown, from which\r\nsucceeding generations have garnered the enduring fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE FOLK-MOOTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular meetings of the Anglo-Saxons, those of the hundred and the\r\nshire, were held in the open air. Since many of those who attended them\r\nhad to travel far, some sign was necessary to mark out the place of\r\nmeeting, and some striking feature, such as a hillock, or a particular\r\ntree, or an ancient barrow, was chosen. Thus we have the Shire Oak,\r\nnear Leeds, which gives its name to the wapentake of Skyrack; and in\r\na charter of Edgar we find the _mot-beorh_ mentioned, and translated\r\n_Congressionis Collem_ = the meeting barrow. (_M. A._, ii., 324.)\r\nIt does not appear that a hillock was an essential feature of these\r\nmeeting-places, though this is popularly supposed to be the case,\r\nbecause the \"Thing-wall\" in Iceland and the \"Tynwald\" in the Isle of\r\nMan have hillocks from which laws were proclaimed. The Thingwall, or\r\nfield of meeting in Iceland had a natural rock just above it, isolated\r\nby a stream, and though proclamations were made from this rock,\r\ndeliberations took place on the level. (Gomme's _Primitive Folk-Moots_,\r\n31.)\r\n\r\nThe Tynwald Hill, in the Isle of Man, which is also still used for\r\nthe proclamation of new laws, was probably an ancient barrow, as\r\nthere are other barrows in the immediate neighbourhood. (Kermode and\r\nHerdman, _Illustrated Notes on Manx Antiquities_, pp. 23 and 61.) At\r\nThingwall, near Liverpool, and Thingwall in Wirral, both probably Norse\r\nsettlements, there is no hillock.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the use of a former motte as a meeting-place for the\r\nbaronial court appears to have been much more common than in England.\r\nMr George Neilson's explanation of this fact is referred to in Chapter\r\nX., p. 307.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nWATLING STREET AND THE DANELAGH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out by Schmid (_Gesetze der Angelsachsen_,\r\nxxxviii.) that the document called _Alfred and Guthrum's Peace_ cannot\r\nbelong to the year of Guthrum's baptism at Wedmore; and Mr J. R. Green\r\n(_Conquest of England_, p. 151) goes further, and doubts whether the\r\nboundaries laid down in this deed refer to anything except to the East\r\nAnglian kingdom of Guthrum. But Mr Green gives no adequate reason for\r\nrejecting the generally accepted conclusion that the Watling Street was\r\nthe boundary between English and Danish Mercia, which is borne out by\r\nthe following facts: (1) the Danish confederacy of the five boroughs,\r\nLincoln, Stamford, Leicester, Nottingham, and Derby, pretty well covers\r\nthe part of Mercia north of Watling Street, especially when Chester\r\nis added, as it sometimes is, to the list; (2) the division into\r\nwapentakes instead of hundreds, now believed to be of Danish origin,\r\nis found in Lincolnshire, Notts, Derbyshire, Rutland, Leicestershire,\r\nand Northamptonshire. Staffordshire, it is true, is not divided into\r\nwapentakes, but it was apparently won by conquest when Ethelfleda\r\nfortified the town. Chester was occupied by her husband in 908. Watling\r\nStreet furnishes such a well-defined line that it was natural to fix\r\nupon it as a frontier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ORIGIN OF ALFRED'S BOROUGHS\r\n\r\n\r\nKeutgen (_Untersuchungen über den Ursprung der Deutschen\r\nStadtverfassung_, 1895) appears to have been the first to notice the\r\nmilitary origin of the Old Saxon boroughs; and Professor Maitland saw\r\nthe applicability of the theory to the boroughs of Alfred and Edward\r\nthe Elder. (_Domesday Book and Beyond._) The _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_,\r\nin 894, speaks of \"the men whose duty it was to defend the towns\"; this\r\nproves that Alfred had made some special arrangement for the defence of\r\nthe towns; and this arrangement must have been something quite apart\r\nfrom the ordinary service of the _fyrd_ or militia, which was only\r\ndue for a short time. It must have been something permanent, with an\r\nadequate economic basis, such as we have in Henry the Fowler's plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D\r\n\r\nTHE WORDS \"CASTRUM\" AND \"CASTELLUM\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we take the chroniclers of the reign of Charlemagne and his\r\nsuccessors in the 9th century, we find the word _castrum_ constantly\r\nused for places such as Avignon, Dijon, Macon, Rheims, Chalons,\r\nCologne, Andernach, Bonn, Coblenz, etc., all of which are known to\r\nhave been Roman _castra_, when there can be no doubt that the _city_\r\nis meant. Take, for instance, the _Annales Mettenses_ (Pertz, i.,\r\n326), 737: Karl Martel hears that the Saracens have taken \"castrum\r\nmunitissimum Avinionem\" (Avignon); he marches against them, and\r\n\"_predictam urbem_ obsidione circumdat.\" But these cities are not only\r\ncalled _castra_, they are also called _castella_. Thus the chronicle\r\nascribed to Hincmar calls Macon both _castrum_ and _castellum_ in\r\nthe same breath. (_Migne_, 125, 1298.) The fortifications built by\r\nCharlemagne against the Saxons are called _castra_, _castella_, and\r\n_civitates_. (_Chron. Moissiacense_, Pertz, i., 308. _Ann. Einhardi_,\r\nibid., 196, 204.) The camps of the Northmen, which as we have seen,\r\nwere of great size, are also called not only _castra_, but _civitates_,\r\n_castella_, _munitiones_, _oppida_. (_Annales Fuldenses_, Pertz, i.,\r\n397.) The camp built by Charles the Bald at Pistes in 868 is called a\r\n_castellum_, though it was evidently an enclosure of great size, as he\r\nmeasured out quarters in it for his nobles, and formed an elaborate\r\nscheme for its maintenance. (Hincmar, _Migne_, 125, 1242, 1244.) Coming\r\nto the 10th century, the following passage from Flodoard will show the\r\nvagueness of the words in common use for fortifications: \"Heribertus\r\nAnsellum Bosonis subditum, qui prædictum custodiebat _castrum_ (Vitry),\r\ncum ipso _castello_ recipit, et Codiacum S. Remigii _municipium_ illi\r\ncum alia terra concedit. Nec longum, Bosonis fideles _oppidanorum_\r\nproditione Victoriacum (Vitry) recipiunt, et Mosonum fraude pervadunt.\r\nAt Heribertus, a quibusdam Mosomensibus evocatus, supervenit\r\ninsperatus, et entrans _oppidum_, porta latenter a _civibus_ aperta,\r\nmilites Bosonis, qui ad custodiam loci residebant, ibidem omnes capit.\"\r\n(_Migne_, 135, 297.) Here it is clear that _castrum_, _castellum_,\r\n_municipium_, and _oppidum_ all mean the same thing, and the one word\r\n_civibus_ betrays that it is a _city_ which is meant. Undoubtedly the\r\nchronicler thinks it elegant to change his words as often as he can.\r\n_Munitio_ is another word frequently used; in classical Latin it means\r\na bulwark, a wall or bank; in the chroniclers of the 10th century it\r\nis used indifferently for a town or castle, though certain passages,\r\nsuch as \"subversis multarum munitionibus urbium\" (Flodoard, i., vi.),\r\nshow that the right sense is not far from the mind of the writer. The\r\nnumerous passages in which we are told of monasteries being enclosed\r\nwith walls and converted into _castella_, show that the _enclosure_\r\nis the chief idea which the chroniclers associate with this word. The\r\ncitations made above are not exceptional, but typical, and could be\r\nparalleled by countless others.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, I have read Keutgen's _Untersuchungen über\r\nden Ursprung der Deutschen Stadtverfassung_. He remarks that the Latin\r\nwords for a town (in the 10th and 11th century writers) are _urbs_,\r\n_castellum_, _civitas_, sometimes _arx_; for a village, _villa_,\r\n_oppidum_, _vicus_. This absolutely agrees with what I have observed in\r\nthese writers, except that I have certainly found _oppidum_ used for a\r\ntown, as in the passage from Flodoard cited above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E\r\n\r\nTHE BURGHAL HIDAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Burghal Hidage_ has been printed by Birch, _Cartularium_, iii.,\r\n671. The manuscript is very corrupt, and several of the places\r\ncannot be identified. Those which can be identified are: Hastings,\r\nLewes, Burpham (near Arundel), Chichester, Porchester, Southampton,\r\nWinchester, Wilton, Tisbury, Shaftesbury, Twineham, Wareham, Bridport,\r\nExeter, Halwell, Lidford, Pilton, Barnstaple, Watchet, Axbridge,\r\nLyng (near Athelney), Langport, Bath, Malmesbury, Cricklade, Oxford,\r\nWallingford, Buckingham, Eashing (near Guildford), and Southwark. The\r\nlist thus seems to give an outline of Alfred's kingdom as it was at\r\nhis death, or at the beginning of the reign of his son. Dr Liebermann\r\nrefers it to the latter date. (_Leges Anglorum_, 9.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F\r\n\r\nTHELWALL\r\n\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Manchester Guardian_ a few years ago suggested a\r\nnew solution of the name Thelwall. He believes that the Thelwall\r\nraised by Edward was a boundary wall of timber, stretching from\r\nThelwall to Runcorn. The Mersey, he argues, above Thelwall formerly\r\nbroadened out into a series of swamps which would effectually defend\r\nthe frontier towards the east. But westward from Thelwall there were\r\nno such obstacles, and it is assumed that Edward made a timber wall\r\nfrom Thelwall to Ethelfleda's fortress at Runcorn. Some support to\r\nthis hypothesis is given in the names of places between Thelwall and\r\nRuncorn: Stockton, Walton (twice), Stockham, Walford, Wallmore, and\r\nWall-hes. Further, when the bed of the Mersey was delved for the Ship\r\nCanal, discovery was made of \"a remarkable series of submerged piles,\r\n9 feet long, arranged in two parallel ranks which were 30 feet apart.\r\nThe intervals between the piles varied, but seem to have averaged 5 to\r\n6 feet. Between the ranks were diagonal rows of upright stakes, each\r\nstake about 5 feet long, extending from either rank chevron-wise to the\r\nmiddle and there overlapping, so that the ground-plan of them makes\r\na kind of herring-bone pattern. By this plan, anyone passing through\r\nwould have to make a zigzag course. In some places sticks and sedges\r\nwere found interwoven horizontally with the stakes, a condition of\r\nthings which probably obtained throughout the whole series. The tops\r\nof the tallest piles were 10 feet below the present surface of the\r\nground, which fact goes far toward precluding the possibility that this\r\nelaborate work may have been a fish-weir. The disposition of the stakes\r\npoints to a military origin. So arranged, the advantage they offered\r\nto defending forces was enormous.\" I think it worth while to reproduce\r\nthis account, especially because of the place-names, but those who are\r\nlearned in the construction of fish-weirs may perhaps think that the\r\ndescription will apply to a work of that kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX G\r\n\r\nTHE WORD \"BRETASCHE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis word, which also appears as bretagium, britagium, or bristega,\r\nevidently means a tower, as is clear from the following passages: Order\r\nfrom King John to erect a _mota et bretagium_ at Roscrea, in Ireland\r\n(Sweetman's _Calendar_, i., 412); Order by Henry III. to the dwellers\r\nin the Valley of Montgomery \"quod sine dilatione motas suas bonis\r\nbretaschiis firmari faciant\" (_Close Rolls_, ii., 42); Order that the\r\ntimber and bretasche of Nafferton Castle be carried to Newcastle, and\r\nthe bretasche to be placed at the gate of the drawbridge _in place of\r\nthe little tower_ which fell through defect in its foundations (_Close\r\nRolls_, i., 549b).\r\n\r\nThe word is also expressly defined by William the Breton as a wooden\r\ncastle: \"Circuibat castrum ex omni parte, et fabricavit brestachias\r\nduplices per septem loca, _castella videlicet lignea_ munitissima.\"\r\n(Bouquet, xvii., 78.)\r\n\r\nSee also Wright, \"Illustrations of Domestic Architecture,\" _Arch.\r\nJourn._, i., 212 and 301. In these papers it is clear that \"breteske\"\r\nmeans a tower, as there are several pictures of it. At a later period\r\nit seems to have been used for a wooden balcony made for the purpose of\r\nshooting, in the same sense as the word \"hurdicium\"; but I have not met\r\nwith any instance of this before the 14th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX H\r\n\r\nTHE WORDS \"HURDICIUM\" AND \"HORDIARI\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese words refer to the wooden galleries carried round the tops of\r\nwalls, to enable the defenders to throw down big stones or other\r\nmissiles on those who were attempting to attack the foot of the walls.\r\n\"Hurdicia quæ muros tutos reddebant.\" (_Philippidos_, vii., 201;\r\nBouquet, xvii.) The word \"alures\" is sometimes used in the same sense.\r\nSee a mandamus of Henry III., cited by Turner, _History of Domestic\r\nArchitecture_, i., 198: \"To make on the same tower [of London] on the\r\nsouth side, at the top, deep alures of good and strong timber, entirely\r\nand well covered with lead, through which people can look even to the\r\nfoot of the tower, and better defend it, if need may be.\" The alures of\r\nthe castle of Norwich are spoken of as early as 1187, but this mention,\r\nand one of the alures round the castle of Winchester in 1193, are the\r\nonly ones I find in the 12th century in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n\"HERICIO, ERICIO, HERITO, HERISSON\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is derived from the French word _hérisson_, a hedgehog, and should\r\nmean something bristling, perhaps with thorns or osiers. Several\r\npassages show that it was a defence on the counterscarp of the ditch,\r\nand it may sometimes have been a hedge. Cohausen, _Befestigungen\r\nder Vorzeit_, shows that hedges were frequently used in early\r\nfortifications (pp. 8-13). The following passages seem to show clearly\r\nthat it was on the counterscarp of the ditch: \"[Montreuil] il a bien\r\nclos, esforce e ferme de pel e _hericon_.\" (Wace, 107.) \"Reparato\r\nexterioris Ardensis munitionis valli fossato et amplificato, et sepibus\r\net ericiis consepto et constipato.\" (Lambert of Ardres, 623, _circa_\r\n1117.) The French poem of Jordan Fantosme, describing the siege of\r\nWark by the Scots in 1174, says the Scots attacked and carried the\r\n_hericon_, and got into the ditch, but they could not take the bayle,\r\n_i.e._, they could not get over the palicium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX K\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE OF YALE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1693, the antiquary Edward Llwyd was sitting on the motte\r\nof Tomen y Rhoddwy engaged in making a very bad plan of the castle\r\n[published in _Arch. Camb._, N.S., ii., 57]. His guide told him that he\r\nhad heard his grandfather say that two earls used to live there. Llwyd\r\ncalled the guide an ignorant fellow. Modern traditions are generally\r\nthe work of some antiquary who has succeeded in planting his theories\r\nlocally; but here we have a tradition of much earlier date than the\r\ntime when antiquaries began to sow tares, and such traditions have\r\nusually a shred of truth in them. Is it possible that this castle of\r\nTomen y Rhoddwy and the neighbouring one of Llanarmon were built by\r\nthe earls of Chester and Shrewsbury, who certainly went on expeditions\r\ntogether against Wales, and appear to have divided their conquests?\r\nIt is to be noted that the township is called _Bodigre yr Yarll_, the\r\ntownship of the earls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX L\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE OF TULLOW OR \"COLLACHT,\" p. 335\r\n\r\n\r\nThis information is kindly supplied by Mr Goddard H. Orpen, who writes\r\nto me: \"I visited Tullow lately, and asked myself where would a Norman\r\nerect a mote, and I had no difficulty in answering: on the high ground\r\nnear where the Protestant church stands. When I got up there the first\r\nthing that I noticed was that the church stood on a platform of earth\r\n10 to 14 feet higher than the road, and that this platform was held in\r\nposition by a strong retaining wall, well battered towards the bottom\r\non one side. I then found on enquiry that the hill on which it stood\r\nand the place to the N.W. of it was called the 'Castle Hill.' On going\r\nround to the N.W. of the church I found a horseshoe-shaped space,\r\nscarped all round to a height of 6 to 10 feet, and rising to about 16\r\nfeet above the adjoining fields. There is no doubt that this was the\r\nsite of the castle, and that it was artificially raised. To my mind\r\nthere was further little doubt that it represented an earlier mote. In\r\na field adjoining on the W. I could detect a platform of about 50 to\r\n70 paces, with traces of a fosse round the three outer sides.... This\r\nwas certainly the Castellum de Tulach mentioned in the deeds concerning\r\nRaymond le Gros' grant to the Abbey of St Thomas.--_Dublin Reg. St\r\nThomas_, pp. 111, 113.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX M\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE OF SLANE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Westropp says that the \"great earthworks and fosses\" on the Hill of\r\nSlane are mentioned in the \"Life of St Patrick\" (_Journ. R. S. A. I._,\r\n1904, p. 313). What the _Life_ really says is: \"They came to Ferta Fer\r\nFiecc,\" which is translated \"the graves of Fiacc's men\"; and the notes\r\nof Muirchu Maccu-Machtheni add, \"which, as fables say, were dug by the\r\nslaves of Feccol Ferchertni, one of the nine Wizards\" (_Tripartite\r\nLife_, p. 278). It does not mention any fort, or even a hill, and\r\nthough Ferta Fer Fiecc is identified with Slane, there is nothing to\r\nshow what part of Slane it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX N\r\n\r\nTHE WORD \"DONJON\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Skeat and _The New English Dictionary_ derive this word\r\nfrom the Low Latin, _dominionem_, acc. of _dominio_, lordship. Leland\r\nfrequently speaks of the keep as the dungeon, which of course is the\r\nsame word. Its modern use for a subterranean prison seems to have\r\narisen when the keeps were abandoned for more spacious and comfortable\r\nhabitations by the noble owners, and were chiefly used as prisons.\r\nThe word _dunio_, which, as we have seen, Lambert of Ardres used\r\nfor a motte, probably comes from a different root, cognate with the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _dun_, a hill, and used in Flanders for the numerous\r\nsandhills of that coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX O\r\n\r\nTHE ARRANGEMENTS IN EARLY KEEPS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe get a glimpse of these in a story given in the \"Gesta Ambasiensium\r\nDominorum,\" D'Archery, _Spicilegium_, 278. Sulpicius the Treasurer\r\nof the Abbey of St Martin at Tours, an important personage, built a\r\nstone keep at Amboise in 1015 (_Chron. Turonense Magnum_), in place\r\nof the \"wooden house\" which his brother had held. In the time of Fulk\r\nRechin (1066-1106), this keep was in the hands of the adherents of\r\nthe counts of Blois. Hugh, son of Sulpicius, with two other men, hid\r\nthemselves by night in the basement, which was used as a storehouse;\r\nit must therefore have had an entrance from outside. With the help\r\nof ropes, they climbed up a sewer into the bedchamber, which was\r\nabove the cellar, and evidently had no stair communicating with the\r\ncellar. Here they found the lady of the house and two maids sleeping,\r\nand a watchman who was also asleep. While one of the men held these\r\nin terror with a drawn sword, the other two climbed up a ladder and\r\nthrough a trap-door up to the roof of the tower, where they unfurled\r\nthe banner of Hugh. Here we see a very simple keep, which has only one\r\nstorey above the basement; this may have been divided into two or more\r\napartments, but it was thought a fitting residence for a lady of rank.\r\nIt had no stairs, but all the communications were by trap-doors and\r\nladders. We may be quite sure that the people of rank of the 11th and\r\n12th centuries were content with much rougher accommodation than Mr\r\nClark imagined. Even Richard I.'s much admired keep of Chateau Gaillard\r\nappears to have had no communication but ladders between the floors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX P\r\n\r\nKEEPS AS RESIDENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe description of a keep which we have already given from Lambert of\r\nArdres (Chap. VI.) is sufficient to prove that even wooden keeps in the\r\n12th century were used as permanent residences, and this is confirmed\r\nby many scattered notices in the various chronicles of France and\r\nEngland. It was not till late in the 13th century that the desire for\r\nmore comfortable rooms led to the building of chambers in the courtyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX Q\r\n\r\nCASTLES BUILT BY HENRY I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe castles, which according to Robert de Monte, Henry I. built\r\naltogether [_ex integro_] were Drincourt, Chateauneuf-sur-Epte,\r\nVerneuil, Nonancourt, Bonmoulins, Colmemont, Pontorson, St\r\nDenis-en-Lyons, and Vaudreuil. Many of these may have been wooden\r\ncastles; Chateauneuf-sur-Epte almost certainly was; it has now a\r\n_round_ donjon on a motte. The \"Tour Grise\" at Verneuil is certainly\r\nnot the work of Henry I., but belongs to the 13th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX R\r\n\r\nTHE SO-CALLED SHELL KEEP\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have three accounts of motte-castles from the 12th century: that\r\nof Alexander Neckham, in the treatise _De Utensilibus_; that of\r\nLaurence of Durham, cited in Chapter VII., p. 147; and the well-known\r\ndescription of the castle of Marchem, also cited in Chapter VI., p.\r\n88. All these three describe the top of the motte as surrounded by a\r\nwall (of course of wood), within which is built a wooden tower. The\r\naccount of Marchem says that it was built in the middle of the area.\r\nThis supports the conjecture in the text. Mr H. E. Malden has shown\r\n(_Surrey Archæolog. Collections_, xvi., 28) that the keep of Guildford\r\nis of later date than the stone wall round the top of the motte. Remove\r\nthis tower, and there would be what is commonly called a shell keep. It\r\nwould appear, therefore, that it was a common practice to change the\r\nbank or stockade round the top of the motte into a stone wall (no doubt\r\nas a defence against fire), leaving the keep inside still of wood. Four\r\nof the pictures from the Bayeux Tapestry (see Frontispiece) all give\r\nthe idea of a wooden tower inside a stockade on a motte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX S\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR LLOYD'S \"HISTORY OF WALES\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI regret that this valuable work did not appear until too late for me\r\nto make use of it in my chapter on Welsh Castles. It is worth while to\r\nnote the following points in which Professor Lloyd's conclusions differ\r\nfrom or confirm those which I have been led to adopt.\r\n\r\nAberystwyth and Aberrheiddiol.--\"After the destruction of the last\r\nAberystwyth Castle of the older situation in 1143, the chief\r\nstronghold of the district was moved to the mouth of the Rheiddiol,\r\na position which it ever afterwards retained, though people still\r\ninsisted on calling it Aberystwyth\" (514). \"The original castle of\r\nAberystwyth crowned the slight eminence at the back of the farm of Tan\r\ny Castell, which lies in the Ystwyth valley 1-1/2 miles S. of the town.\r\nThere is the further evidence of the name, and the earthworks still\r\nvisible on the summit\" (426, _note_).\r\n\r\nCarreghova.--I ought perhaps to have included this castle in my list,\r\nthough on the actual map its site is within the English border; but as\r\nthere are absolutely no remains of it [D. H. M.] it does not affect the\r\nquestion I am discussing.\r\n\r\nCardigan and Cilgerran.--\"Dingeraint cannot be Cilgerran, because\r\nCilgerran is derived from _Cerran_, with the feminine inflection, not\r\nfrom _Geraint_; nor is Cilgerran 'close to the fall of the Teifi into\r\nthe sea,' as the chronicler says Dingeraint was. The castle built by\r\nEarl Roger was probably Cardigan\" (401). Professor Lloyd afterwards\r\nidentifies Cilgerran with the castle of Emlyn (661). This seems to me\r\nquestionable, as the \"New Castle of Emlyn,\" first mentioned in Edward\r\nI.'s reign, presupposes an older castle, and as I have stated, a mound\r\nanswering to the older castle still exists not far from the stone\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nCarmarthen.--Professor Lloyd thinks this castle stood at the present\r\nfarm of Rhyd y Gors, about a mile below the town; but I see no reason\r\nto alter the conclusion to which I was led by Mr Floyd's paper, that\r\nthe Rhyd y Gors of the castle was a ford at Carmarthen itself. The fact\r\nthat Henry I. founded a cell to Battle Abbey at Carmarthen (431) seems\r\nto me an additional piece of evidence that the castle was there; castle\r\nand abbey nearly always went together.\r\n\r\nDinweiler.--Professor Lloyd assumes Dinweiler to be the same as the\r\ncastle in Mabudryd built by Earl Gilbert, and to be situated at or\r\nnear Pencader (501). It should be noted, however, that Dinweiler reads\r\nDinefor in MS. B. of the _Brut_, in 1158. I am in error in supposing St\r\nClair to be the castle of Mabudryd (following a writer in _Archæologia\r\nCambrensis_), as St Clair is not in that commote. Professor Lloyd's map\r\nof the _cantrefs_ and _commotes_ differs widely from that of previous\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nLlangadoc.--\"Luchewein\" should not be identified with this castle;\r\nProfessor Lloyd thinks it may refer to a castle at Llwch Owain, a lake\r\nin the parish of Llanarthney, where there is an entrenchment known as\r\nCastell y Garreg.\r\n\r\nMaud's Castle.--Camden identified \"Matildis castrum\" with Colewent or\r\nColwyn, but Professor Lloyd is of opinion that \"a careful collation of\r\nthe English and Welsh authorities for the events of the years 1198 and\r\n1231 will make it clear that Payne's Castle and Maud's Castle are the\r\nsame.\" This of course does not affect what is said about Colwyn Castle\r\nin the text.\r\n\r\nMontgomery.--Professor Lloyd deems that the emphasis laid (especially\r\nin the _Charter Rolls_, i., 101) on the fact that the building of Henry\r\nIII.'s reign was New Montgomery, leaves no doubt that the former town\r\nand castle stood elsewhere, probably at Hên Domen. This, if true, would\r\ngreatly strengthen my case, as Hên Domen is an admirable motte and\r\nbailey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE OF ENGLISH CASTLES KNOWN TO DATE FROM THE ELEVENTH\r\nCENTURY[1207]\r\n\r\n\r\nIN TOWNS\r\n\r\n      Name of                      Whole Area of Enceinte\r\n No.  Castle.

H. St John Hope arrived independently at similar conclusions.\r\n\r\n[2] In the paper on Earthworks in the second volume of the _Victoria\r\nCounty History of Yorkshire_, this subdivision of the promiscuous class\r\nX., is used.\r\n\r\n[3] Since the above was written, Mr Hadrian Allcroft's work on\r\n_Earthwork of England_ has furnished an admirable text-book of this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[4] See Frontispiece.\r\n\r\n[5] See Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[6] For instance, at Berkeley, Ewias Harold, Yelden, and Tomen y Roddwy.\r\n\r\n[7] As at Rayleigh and Downpatrick.\r\n\r\n[8] In some of these castles there is no gap in the bailey banks for an\r\nentrance. They must have been entered by a movable wooden stair, such\r\nas horses can be taught to climb. See the plan of Topcliffe Castle,\r\nYorks (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[9] _Vor Oldtid_, p. 629.\r\n\r\n[10] _Entwickelung des Kriegswesens_, iii., 379.\r\n\r\n[11] See Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n[12] _Primitive Folkmoots._ See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n[13] _Early Fortifications in Scotland_, p. 13. He adds an instance\r\nshowing that Moot Hill is sometimes a mistake for Moot Hall.\r\n\r\n[14] _Scottish Review_, vol. xxxii.\r\n\r\n[15] Some writers give the name of moot-hill to places in Yorkshire\r\nand elsewhere where the older ordnance maps give moat-hill. _Moat_ in\r\nthis connection is the same as _motte_, the Scotch and Irish _mote_,\r\ni.e., the hillock of a castle, derived from the Norman-French word\r\n_motte_. As this word is by far the most convenient name to give to\r\nthese hillocks, being the only specific name which they have ever had,\r\nwe shall henceforth use it in these pages. We prefer it to _mote_,\r\nwhich is the Anglicised form of the word, because of its confusion\r\nwith _moat_, a ditch. Some writers advocate the word _mount_, but this\r\nappears to us too vague. As the word _motte_ is French in origin, it\r\nappropriately describes a thing which was very un-English when first\r\nintroduced here.\r\n\r\n[16] At York, a prehistoric crouching skeleton was found by Messrs\r\nBenson and Platnauer when excavating the castle hill in 1903, 4 feet\r\n6 inches below the level of the ground. The motte at York appears\r\nto have been raised after the destruction of the first castle, but\r\nwhether the first hillock belonged to the ancient burial is not decided\r\nby the account, \"Notes on Clifford's Tower,\" by the above authors.\r\n_Trans. York. Philosoph. Soc._, 1902. Another instance is recorded in\r\nthe _Revue Archæologique_, to which we have unfortunately lost the\r\nreference.\r\n\r\n[17] From the report of a competent witness, Mr Basil Stallybrass.\r\n\r\n[18] Earle, _Two Saxon Chronicles Parallel_, Introd., xxiii.\r\n\r\n[19] Nennius says that Ida \"_unxit_ (read cinxit) Dynguayrdi\r\nGuerth-Berneich\"=a strength or fort of Bernicia. _Mon. Hist. Brit._,\r\n75. Elsewhere he calls Bamborough Dinguo Aroy. It is quite possible\r\nthat there might have been a Keltic _din_ in a place so well fitted for\r\none as Bamborough.\r\n\r\n[20] Bede, H. E., iii., 16.\r\n\r\n[21] See Bede, as above, and Symeon, ii., 45 (R.S.).\r\n\r\n[22] We infer this from the strong defences of what is now the middle\r\nward.\r\n\r\n[23] The fact, however, that the _Trinoda Necessitas_, the duty of\r\nlandholders to contribute to the repair of boroughs and bridges, and to\r\nserve in the fyrd, is occasionally mentioned in charters earlier than\r\nthe Danish wars, shows that there were town walls to be kept up even at\r\nthat date. See Baldwin Brown, _The Arts in Early England_, i., 82.\r\n\r\n[24] See Wright, _History of Domestic Manners_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[25] The Danish fortress of Nottingham is mentioned by the _Chronicle_\r\nin 868, but we are speaking now of purely Anglo-Saxon fortresses.\r\n\r\n[26] Asser, ch. 91, Stevenson's edition.\r\n\r\n[27] \"That same year King Alfred repaired London; and all the English\r\nsubmitted to him, except those who were under the bondage of the\r\nDanish men; and then he committed the city (_burh_) to the keeping of\r\nEthelred the ealdorman.\" _A.-S.

C._, 910, 911.\r\n\r\n[36] _New English Dictionary_, Borough.\r\n\r\n[37] _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, 942. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has three\r\nwords for fortifications, _burh_, _faesten_, and _geweorc_. Burh is\r\nalways used for those of Edward and Ethelfleda, faesten (fastness) or\r\ngeweorc (work) for those of the Danes.\r\n\r\n[38] See the illustrations in Wright, _History of Domestic Manners_.\r\n\r\n[39] _Bury_ is formed from _byrig_, the dative of _burh_.\r\n\r\n[40] Professor Maitland observed: \"To say nothing of hamlets, we\r\nhave full 250 parishes whose names end in burgh, bury, or borough,\r\nand in many cases we see no sign in them of an ancient camp or of an\r\nexceptionally dense population.\" _Domesday Book and Beyond_, 184.\r\n\r\n[41] Schmid, _Gesetze der Angelsachsen_, pp. 176, 214, 372. It is not\r\nabsolutely certain that the _burh_ in these three cases does not mean a\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n[42] Schmid, 138. Professor Maitland says: \"In Athelstan's day it seems\r\nto be supposed by the legislator that a _moot_ will usually be held in\r\na _burh_. If a man neglect three summonses to a moot, the oldest men\r\nof the _burh_ are to ride to his place and seize his goods.\" _Domesday\r\nBook and Beyond_, 185. \"All my reeves,\" are mentioned in the Preface to\r\n_Athelstan's Laws_, Schmid, 126.\r\n\r\n[43] Schmid, 138. \"Butan porte\" is the Saxon expression, _port_ being\r\nanother word for town; see Schmid, 643.\r\n\r\n[44] Schmid, Edgar III., 5; Ethelred II., 6.\r\n\r\n[45] Edgar IV., 2.\r\n\r\n[46] The writer was first led to doubt the correctness of the late Mr\r\nG. T. Clark's theory of burhs by examining the A.-S. illustrated MSS.\r\nin the British Museum. On p. 29 of the MS. of _Prudentius_ (Cleopatra,\r\nc. viii.), there is an excellent drawing of a four-sided enclosure,\r\nwith towers at the angles, and battlemented walls of masonry. The\r\ntitle of the picture is \"Virtutes urbem ingrediuntur,\" and _urbem_ is\r\nrendered in the A.-S. gloss as _burh_. See Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[47] Florence translates _burh_ as _urbs_ nineteen times, as _arx_ four\r\ntimes, as _murum_ once, as _munitio_ once, as _civitas_ once.\r\n\r\n[48] Published in 1884, but comprising a number of papers read to\r\nvarious archæological societies through many previous years, during\r\nwhich Mr Clark's reputation as an archæologist appears to have been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[49] \"Eallum thæm folc to gebeorge.\" Birch's _Cartularium_, ii., 222.\r\n\r\n[50] Professor Maitland has claimed that the origin of the boroughs\r\nwas largely military, the duty of maintaining the walls of the county\r\nborough being incumbent on the magnates of the shire. _Domesday Book\r\nand Beyond_, 189.

This castle is generally supposed\r\nto be Richard's Castle, Herefordshire, built by Richard Scrob; but I\r\nsee no reason why it should not be Hereford, as the Norman Ralph, King\r\nEdward's nephew, was Earl of Hereford. We shall return to these castles\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n[56] Mr Freeman says: \"In the eleventh century, the word _castel_ was\r\nintroduced into our language to mark something which was evidently\r\nquite distinct from the familiar _burh_ of ancient times.... Ordericus\r\nspeaks of the thing and its name as something distinctly French:\r\n\"munitiones quas Galli castella nuncupant.\" The castles which were now\r\nintroduced into England seem to have been new inventions in Normandy\r\nitself. William of Jumièges distinctly makes the building of castles to\r\nhave been one of the main signs and causes of the general disorder of\r\nthe days of William's minority, and he seems to speak of the practice\r\nas something new.\" _N. C._, ii., 606. It is surprising that after so\r\nclear a statement as this, Mr Freeman should have fallen under the\r\ninfluence of Mr Clark's _burh_ theory, and should completely have\r\nconfused castles and boroughs.\r\n\r\n[57] _Codex Diplomaticus_, i., 138.\r\n\r\n[58] _History of Rochester_, 1772, p. 21.\r\n\r\n[59] Stevenson's edition of _Asser_, 331.

It seems more likely\r\nthat this use, of which there are undoubted instances in historic times\r\n(see Cæsar, _Bello Gallico_, vi., 10, and v., 21), belonged to a more\r\nadvanced stage of development, when population had moved down into the\r\nlower and cultivatable lands, but still used their old forts in cases\r\nof emergency.\r\n\r\n[69] _Ante_, p. 21.\r\n\r\n[70] Haverfield, in V.

In\r\nthe charter in which Geoffrey de Wirche makes this gift Chircheberie is\r\ncalled Kirkeberia [_M.

That Edward, whose whole time was\r\nfully occupied with his conquests from the Danish settlers, could have\r\nsuddenly transported his forces into one of the remotest corners of\r\nWales, would have been a feat worthy of the coming days of air-ships.\r\nWilliam of Worcester has preserved a tradition that Edward repaired\r\nBurgh, \"quae olim Saxonice dicebatur Burgh-chester,\" but he confuses it\r\nwith Norwich. _Itinerarium_, 337. Is it possible that we ought to look\r\nfor Cledemuthan at Burgh Castle, at the mouth of the Waveney?

It was used in this sense at least as late as the end of the\r\n12th century; see, _e.g._, Lamprecht's _Alexanderlied_, passim.

His words\r\nare: \"Munitionem quoque apud Codiciacum tuto loco constituit atque\r\nfirmavit.\" _Munitio_ properly means a bulwark or wall.\r\n\r\n[163] _Gesta Episcop. Cameracensium_, Pertz, vii., 424.\r\n\r\n[164] _Chron. Camarense et Atrebatorum_, Bouquet, x., 196.\r\n\r\n[165] Sismondi, _Histoire des Français_, ii., 172.\r\n\r\n[166] Guizot, _Histoire de la Civilisation en France_, iii., 311.\r\n\r\n[167] Enlart, _Manuel d'Archæologie Française_, ii., 494.\r\n\r\n[168] See Dr Haverfield's articles in the _Victoria County Histories_,\r\npassim. The late J. H. Burton justly wrote: \"We have nothing from the\r\nRomans answering to the feudal stronghold or castle, no vestige of a\r\nplace where a great man lived apart with his family and his servants,\r\nruling over dependants and fortifying himself against enemies.\"\r\n_History of Scotland_, i., 385.\r\n\r\n[169] _Annals of Fulda_, 394, Pertz, i.\r\n\r\n[170] _Cap. Regum Francor._, ii., 360.\r\n\r\n[171] Thus De Caumont unfortunately spoke of the fortress built\r\nby Nicetus, Bishop of Treves, in the 6th century, as a _château_\r\n(_Abécédaire_, ii., 382); but Venantius Fortunatus, in his descriptive\r\npoem, tells us that it was a vast enclosure with no less than thirty\r\ntowers, built by the good pastor for the protection of his flock. It\r\neven contained fields and vineyards, and altogether was as different\r\nfrom a private castle as anything can well be. Similarly the _castrum_\r\nof Merliac, spoken of by Enlart (_Architecture Militaire_, p. 492) as\r\na \"veritable château,\" is described as containing cultivated lands\r\nand sheets of water! (Cited from Gregory of Tours, _Hist. Francorum_,\r\nliii., 13.) De Caumont himself says: \"Les grandes exploitations rurales\r\nque possédaient les rois de France et les principaux du royaume du\r\nV^ième au X^ième siècle ne furent pas des forteresses et ne doivent\r\npoint être confondues avec les chateaux.\" _Abécédaire_, ii., 62.\r\n\r\n[172] See Appendix D.\r\n\r\n[173] \"Volumus et expresse mandamus, ut quicunque istis temporibus\r\ncastella et firmitates et haias sine nostro verbo fecerint, Kalendis\r\nAugusti omnes tales firmitates disfactas habeant; quia vicini et\r\ncircummanentes exinde multas depredationes et impedimenta sustinent.\"\r\n_Capitularia Regum Francorum_, Boretius, ii., 328.\r\n\r\n[174] These instances are as follows:--868, A certain Acfrid shut\r\nhimself up in a _casa firmissima_ in the _villa_ of Bellus Pauliacus\r\non the Loire, and it was burnt over his head (_Annales Bertinianorum_,\r\npp. Migne, 125, 1237); 878, The sons of Goisfrid attack the _castellum_\r\nand lands of the son of Odo (_ibid._, p. 1286); 879, Louis the Germanic\r\nbesieges some men of Hugh, son of Lothaire, _in quodam castello\r\njuxta Viridunum_: he takes and destroys the castellum (_Annals of\r\nFulda_, Pertz, i., 393); 906, Gerard and Matfrid fortify themselves\r\nin a certain _castrum_, in a private war (_Regino_, Pertz, i., 611).\r\nSismondi states that the great nobles wrested from Louis-le-Bégue\r\n(877-879) the right of building private castles. So far, we have been\r\nunable to find any original authority for this statement.\r\n\r\n[175] See Guizot, _Histoire de la Civilisation_, iii., 309. \"On voit\r\nles _villæ_ s'entourer peu à peu de fossés, de remparts de terre, de\r\nquelques apparences de fortifications.\"\r\n\r\n[176] We hear of monasteries being fortified in this way; in 869\r\nCharles the Bald drew a bank of wood and stone round the monastery\r\nof St Denis; \"castellum in gyro ipsius monasterii ex ligno et lapide\r\nconficere coepit.\" _Ann. Bertinian_, Migne, pp. 125, 1244. In 889 the\r\nBishop of Nantes made a _castrum_ of his church by enclosing it with a\r\nwall, and this wall appears to have had a tower. _Chron. Namnetense_,\r\np. 45, in _Lobineau's Bretagne_, vol. ii. In 924 Archbishop Hervey made\r\na _castellum_ of the monastery of St Remi by enclosing it with a wall.\r\n_Flodoard_, p. 294 (Migne). But the fortification of monasteries was a\r\nvery different thing from the fortification of private castles.\r\n\r\n[177] In 951 Duke Conrad, being angry with certain men of Lorraine,\r\nthrew down the _towers_ of some of them; these may have been the keeps\r\nof private castles. Flodoard, _Annales_, p. 477.\r\n\r\n[178] _Presidium_ is one of those vague words which chroniclers love to\r\nuse; it means a defence of any kind, and may be a town, a castle, or a\r\ngarrison. The town in which this turris stood appears by the context to\r\nhave been Chateau Thierry. _Cf._ Flodoard, _Annales_, pp. 924, with 933.\r\n\r\n[179] \"Castrum muro factum circa eam [ecclesiam].\" _Chron. Namnetense_,\r\np. 45. \"Precepit [Alanus] eis terrarium magnum in circuitu Ecclesiæ\r\nfacere, sicut murus prioris castri steterat, quo facto turrem\r\nprincipalem _reficiens_, in ea domum suam constitit.\" _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[180] Flodoard, _Annales_, pp. 931 and 949. This tower was heightened\r\nby Charles, the last of the Carlovingians, and furnished with a ditch\r\nand bank, in 988.\r\n\r\n[181] It is often supposed that these towers were derived from the\r\n_Pretoria_, or general's quarters in the Roman _castra_. It is far more\r\nprobable that they were derived from mural towers. The Pretorium was\r\nnot originally fortified, and it was placed in the centre of the Roman\r\ncamp. But one great object of the feudal keep was to have communication\r\nwith the open country. The keep of Laon was certainly on the line of\r\nthe walls, as Bishop Ascelin escaped from it down a rope in 989, and\r\ngot away on a horse which was waiting for him. Palgrave, _England and\r\nNormandy_, ii., 880.\r\n\r\n[182] The word _motte_ or _mota_ does not occur in any contemporary\r\nchronicle, as far as is known to the writer, before the 12th century;\r\nnor is the word _dangio_ to be found in any writer earlier than\r\nOrdericus. But the _thing_ certainly existed earlier.\r\n\r\n[183] [Fulk and his son Geoffrey] \"in occidentali parte montis castellum\r\ndeterminaverunt.... Aggerem quoque in prospectu monasterii cum turre\r\nlignea erexerunt.\" _Chron. St Florentii_, in Lobineau's _Bretagne_,\r\nii., 87. Some remains of this motte are still visible. De Salies,\r\n_Foulques Nerra_, p. 263.\r\n\r\n[184] \"Elegantissimus in rebus bellicis\" is the quaint language of the\r\nAngevin chronicler, 176.\r\n\r\n[185] See De Salies, _Histoire de Foulques Nerra_, which indirectly\r\nthrows considerable light on the archæological question.\r\n\r\n[186] Salies, _Histoire de Foulques Nerra_, p. 170. M. Enlart, in his\r\n_Manuel d'Archæologie Française_, ii., 495, has been misled about this\r\ncastle by the _Chronicon Andegavense_, which says: \"Odo.... Fulconem\r\nexpugnare speravit, et totis nisibus adorsus est. Annoque presenti\r\n(1025) Montis Budelli castellum, quod circiter annos decem retro abhinc\r\ncontra civitatem Turonicam firmaverat Fulco, obsedit, et turrim ligneam\r\nmiræ altitudinis super domgionem ipsius castri erexit.\" Bouquet, x.,\r\n176. M. Enlart takes this to be the first recorded instance of a\r\nmotte. But the passage is evidently corrupt, as the other accounts of\r\nthis affair show that Count Odo's wooden tower was a siege engine,\r\nemployed to attack Fulk's castle, and afterwards burnt by the besieged.\r\nSee the _Gesta Ambasiens. Dom._, _ibid._, p. 257, and the _Chron. St\r\nFlorentii_. Probably we should read _contra_ domgionem instead of\r\n_super_. The _Chronicon Andegavense_ was written in the reign of Henry\r\nII.\r\n\r\n[187] When Fulk invaded Bretagne in or about 992, he collected an army\r\n\"tam de suis quam conductitiis.\" _Richerius_, edition Guadet. The\r\neditor remarks that this is perhaps the first example of the use of\r\nmercenaries since the time of the Romans (ii., 266). Spannagel, citing\r\nPeter Damian, says that mercenaries were already common at the end of\r\nthe 10th century. _Zur Geschichte des Deutschen Heerwesens_, pp. 72, 73.\r\n\r\n[188] This was always the custom in mediæval castles. See Cohausen,\r\n_Befestigungen der Vorzeit_, p. 282.\r\n\r\n[189] \"Qui vivens turres altas construxit et ædes, Unam Carnotum, sed\r\napud Dunense reatum.\" _Chron. St Florentii._\r\n\r\n[190] _Chron. Namnetense_, Lobineau, ii., 47.\r\n\r\n[191] _Gesta Ambasiensium Dominorum_, in _Spicilegium_, p. 273.\r\n\r\n[192] _Guide Joanne_, p. 234.\r\n\r\n[193] The furthest point of the headland on which the castle is\r\nplaced is a small circular court, with a fosse on all sides but the\r\nprecipices. From personal visitation.\r\n\r\n[194] _Dunio_ is subsequently explained by Lambert as _motte_: \"Motam\r\naltissimam sive dunionem eminentem in munitionis signum firmavit.\"\r\n_Lamberti Ardensis_, p. 613. It is the same word as the Saxon _dun_,\r\na hill (preserved in our South Downs), and has no connection with the\r\nIrish and Gaelic _dun_, which is cognate with the German _zaun_, a\r\nhedge, A.-S. _tun_, and means a hedged or fortified place. The form\r\n_dange_ appears in Northern France, and this seems to be the origin of\r\nthe word _domgio_ or _dangio_ which we find in the chroniclers, the\r\nmodern form of which is _donjon_. If we accept this etymology, we must\r\nbelieve that the word _dunio_ or _domgio_ was originally applied to\r\nthe hill, and not to the tower on the hill, to which it was afterwards\r\ntransferred. It is against this view that Ordericus, writing some\r\nfifty years before Lambert, uses the form _dangio_ in the sense of a\r\ntower. Professor Skeat and the _New English Dictionary_ derive the word\r\n_donjon_ or _dungeon_ from Low Lat. _domnionem_, acc. of _domnio_, thus\r\nconnecting it with _dominus_, as the seignorial residence.\r\n\r\n[195] Ducange conjectured that the motte-castle took its origin in\r\nFlanders, but it was probably the passage cited above from Lambert\r\nwhich led him to this conclusion. See art. \"Mota\" in Ducange's\r\n_Glossarium_.\r\n\r\n[196] Steenstrup, _Normannerne_, i., 297.\r\n\r\n[197] _Ibid._, i., 301.\r\n\r\n[198] _England and Normandy_, ii., 535.\r\n\r\n[199] \"Muros et propugnacula civitatum refecit et augmentavit.\" _Dudo_,\r\np. 85 (Duchesne's edition).\r\n\r\n[200] \"Henricus rex circa turrem Rothomagi, _quam ædificavit primus\r\nRichardus dux Normannorum in palatium sibi_, murum altum et latum cum\r\npropugnaculis ædificat.\" _Robert of Toringy_, R.S., p. 106.\r\n\r\n[201] _Ordericus_, ii., 15, 17, 46 (edition Prévost).\r\n\r\n[202] _William of Jumièges_, anno 1035. Mr Freeman remarks that the\r\nlanguage of William would lead us to suppose that the practice of\r\ncastle-building was new.\r\n\r\n[203] There are some facts which render it probable that the earliest\r\ncastles built in Normandy were without mottes, and were simple\r\nenclosures like those we have described already. Thus the castle of\r\nthe great family of Montgomeri is an enclosure of this simple kind.\r\nDomfront, built by William Talvas in Duke Robert's time, has no motte.\r\nOn the other hand, Ivry, built by the Countess Albereda in Duke Richard\r\nI.'s days, \"on the top of a hill overlooking the town\" (William of\r\nJumièges), may possibly have been a motte; and there is a motte at\r\nNorrei, which we have just mentioned as an early Norman castle.\r\n\r\n[204] _Manuel d'Archæologie Française_, p. 457.\r\n\r\n[205] This want will be supplied, as regards England, by the completion\r\nof the _Victoria County Histories_, and as regards France, by the\r\n_Societé Préhistorique_, which is now undertaking a catalogue of all\r\nthe earthworks of France. The late M. Mortillet, in an article in the\r\n_Revue Mensuelle de l'École d'Anthropologie_, viii., 1895, published\r\ntwo lists, one of actual mottes in France, the other of place-names in\r\nwhich the word motte is incorporated. Unfortunately the first list is\r\nextremely defective, and the second, as it only relates to the name,\r\nis not a safe guide to the proportional numbers of the thing. All that\r\nthe lists prove is that mottes are to be found in all parts of France,\r\nand that place-names into which the word _motte_ enters seem to be more\r\nabundant in Central France than anywhere else. It is possible that a\r\ncareful examination of local chroniclers may lead to the discovery\r\nof some earlier motte-builder than Thibault-le-Tricheur. We should\r\nprobably know more about Thibault's castles were it not that the Pays\r\nChartrain, as Palgrave says, is almost destitute of chroniclers.\r\n\r\n[206] Cited at length by De Caumont, _Bulletin Monumental_, ix., 246.\r\nVon Hochfelden considered that the origin of feudal fortresses in\r\nGermany hardly goes back to the 10th century; only great dukes and\r\ncounts then thought of fortifying their manors; those of the small\r\nnobility date at earliest from the end of the 12th century.\r\n\r\n[207] _Die Befestigungen der Vorzeit_, p. 28.\r\n\r\n[208] _Entwickelung des Kriegswesens_, iii., 370.\r\n\r\n[209] _Antiquitates Italicæ_, ii., 504. He says they are many times\r\nmentioned both in charters and chronicles in Italy.\r\n\r\n[210] We hear of Robert Guiscard building a wooden castle on a hill at\r\nRocca di St Martino in 1047.

See Amari, _ibid._, p.\r\n220.\r\n\r\n[211] Especially Montfort and Blanchegarde. But there is a wide field\r\nfor further research both in Palestine and Sicily.\r\n\r\n[212] \"Bei den Sclaven haben die Chateaux-à-motte keinen Eingang\r\ngefunden, weil ihnen das Lehnswesen fremd geblieben ist.\" iii., 338.\r\n\r\n[213] Professor Montelius informed the writer that they are quite\r\nunknown in Norway or Sweden; and Dr Christison obtained an assurance to\r\nthe same effect from Herr Hildebrand.\r\n\r\n[214] \"These are small well-defended places, the stronghold of the\r\nindividual, built for a great man and his followers, and answering to\r\nmediæval conditions, to a more or less developed feudal system.\" _Vor\r\nOldtid_, p. 642.\r\n\r\n[215] I am informed by a skilled engineer that even in the wet climate\r\nof England it would take about ten years for the soil to settle\r\nsufficiently to bear a stone building.\r\n\r\n[216] Köhler says: \"By far the greater part of the castles of the\r\nTeutonic knights in Prussia, until the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, were of wood and earth.\" _Die Entwickelung des Kriegswesen_,\r\niii., 376.\r\n\r\n[217] _Cal. of Patent Rolls_, 1232-1247, p. 340.

St John\r\nHope's paper on \"English Fortresses\" in _Arch. Journ._, lx., 72-90.\r\n\r\n[224] Only a very small number of mottes have as yet been excavated.\r\nWells were found at Almondbury, Berkeley, Berkhampstead, Carisbrook,\r\nConisborough, Kenilworth, Northallerton, Norwich, Pontefract, Oxford,\r\nTunbridge, Worcester, and York. At Caus, there is a well in the ditch\r\nbetween the motte and the bailey. Frequently there is a second well in\r\nthe bailey.\r\n\r\n[225] The writer at one time thought that the ruins at the east end of\r\nthe castle of Pontefract concealed a second motte, but wishes now to\r\nrecant this opinion. _Eng. Hist. Review_, xix., 419.\r\n\r\n[226] Thus Henry I. erected a siege castle to watch Bridgenorth\r\n(probably Pampudding Hill), and then went off to besiege another\r\ncastle. Mr Orpen kindly informs me that the camp from which Philip\r\nAugustus besieged Château Gaillard contains a motte. Outside Pickering,\r\nCorfe, and Exeter there are earthworks which have probably been siege\r\ncastles.\r\n\r\n[227] Henry II. built a castle and very fine borough (burgum pergrande)\r\nat Beauvoir in Maine. _Robert of Torigny_, R.S., p. 243.

Unfortunately this work of Neckham's was not written to\r\nexplain the construction of motte castles, but to furnish his pupils\r\nwith the Latin names of familiar things; a good deal of it is very\r\nobscure now.\r\n\r\n[230] See frontispiece.\r\n\r\n[231] _Acta Sanctorum_, 27th January, Bolland, iii., 414. This\r\nbiography was written only nine months after Bishop John's death, by an\r\nintimate friend, John de Collemedio.\r\n\r\n[232] Guisnes is now in Picardy, but in the 12th century it was in\r\nFlanders, which was a fief of the Empire.\r\n\r\n[233] This description is from the _Historia Ardensium_ of Walter de\r\nClusa, which is interpolated in the work of Lambert, Bouquet, pp. 13,\r\n624.\r\n\r\n[234] Yet in some of the later keeps, such as Conisburgh, where we find\r\nonly one window to a storey, the room must have been undivided.\r\n\r\n[235] See Wright, _History of Domestic Manners_, p. 26.\r\n\r\n[236] According to Littré, the original derivation of the word _motte_\r\nis unknown. I have not found any instance of the word _mota_ in\r\nchronicles earlier than the 12th century, but the reason appears to be\r\nthat _mota_ or motte was a folk's word, and appeared undignified to an\r\nambitious writer. Thus the author of the _Gesta Consulum Andegavensium_\r\nsays that Geoffrey Martel, Count of Anjou, gave to a certain Fulcoius\r\nthe fortified house which is still called by the vulgar Mota Fulcoii.\r\nD'Achery, _Spicilegium_, p. 257.\r\n\r\n[237] See Appendix G.\r\n\r\n[238] See Appendix H.\r\n\r\n[239] _Peel, its Meaning and Derivation_, by George Neilson.\r\n\r\n[240] See Appendix I. Cohausen has some useful remarks on the use of\r\nhedges in fortification. _Befestigungen der Vorzeit_, pp. 8-13. A\r\nquickset hedge had the advantage of resisting fire. The word _sepes_,\r\nwhich properly means a hedge, is often applied to the palitium.\r\n\r\n[241] This list or _catalogue raisonné_ was originally published in the\r\n_English Historical Review_ for 1904 (vol. xix.). It is now reproduced\r\nwith such corrections as were necessary, and with the addition of five\r\nmore castles, as well as of details about thirty-four castles for which\r\nthere was not space in the _Review_. The Welsh castles are omitted from\r\nthis list, as they will be given in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n[242] The list is brought up to fifty by interpreting the _regis domus_\r\nof Winchester to be Winchester castle; the reasons for this will be\r\ngiven later. The number would be increased to fifty-two if we counted\r\nFerle and Bourne in Sussex as castles, as Mr Freeman does in his\r\n_Norman Conquest_, v., 808. But the language of Domesday seems only to\r\nmean that the lands of these manors were held of Hastings castle by the\r\nservice of castle-guard. See D. B., i., pp. 21 and 206.\r\n\r\n[243] The total number would be eighty-six if Burton and Aldreth were\r\nincluded. Burton castle is mentioned in Domesday, but there is no\r\nfurther trace of its existence. The castle of Alrehede or Aldreth in\r\nthe island of Ely is stated by the _Liber Eliensis_ to have been built\r\nby the Conqueror, but no remains of any kind appear to exist now. Both\r\nthese castles are therefore omitted from the list.\r\n\r\n[244] Exact numbers cannot be given, because in some cases the bounds\r\nof the ancient borough are doubtful, as at Quatford.\r\n\r\n[245] At Winchester and Exeter. For Winchester, see Milner, _History of\r\nWinchester_, ii., 194; for Exeter, Shorrt's _Sylva Antiqua Iscana_, p.\r\n7.\r\n\r\n[246] Colchester is the only exception to this rule, as the castle\r\nthere is in the middle of the town; but even this is only an apparent\r\nexception, as the second bailey extended to the town wall on the north,\r\nand had been royal demesne land even before the Conquest. See Round's\r\n_Colchester Castle_, ch. vii.\r\n\r\n[247] These five are Berkeley, Berkhampstead, Bourn, Pontefract,\r\nRayleigh.\r\n\r\n[248] I am indebted for these measurements to Mr D. H.

The above was written before the appearance\r\nof Mr Round's paper on \"The Castles of the Conquest\" (_Archæologia_,\r\nlviii.), in which he rejects the idea that _castrum Harundel_ means the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\n[253] See _ante_, p. 28.\r\n\r\n[254] Florence of Worcester mentions the castle of Arundel as belonging\r\nto Roger de Montgomeri in 1088.\r\n\r\n[255] See Appendix R.\r\n\r\n[256] The expenses entered in the _Pipe Rolls_ (1170-1187) are for the\r\nworks of the castle, the chamber and wall of the castle, the _houses_\r\nof the castle (an expression which generally refers to the keep), and\r\nfor flooring the tower (turris) and making a garden. _Turris_ is the\r\nusual word for a keep, and is never applied to a mere mural tower.\r\n\r\n[257] This gateway is masked by a work of the 13th century, which\r\nserves as a sort of barbican.\r\n\r\n[258] In operibus castelli de Arundel 22_l._ 7_s._ 8_d._ Et debet\r\n55_l._ 18_s._ 6_d._ _Pipe Roll_, 31, Henry I., p. 42.\r\n\r\n[259] D.

Bates, in a very\r\nvaluable paper on Bamborough Castle, in _Archæologia Æliana_, vol.\r\nxiv., \"Border Holds.\" Mr Bates gives other evidence to the same\r\neffect. The early existence of the castle is also proved by the fact\r\nthat Gospatric, whom William had made Earl of Northumberland, after\r\nhis raid on Cumberland in 1070, brought his booty to the _firmissimam\r\nmunitionem_ of Bamborough. Symeon of Durham, 1070.\r\n\r\n[261] _Vita S. Oswaldi_, ch. xlviii., in Rolls edition of Symeon.\r\n\r\n[262] This was the opinion of the late Mr Cadwalader Bates, who thought\r\nthat the smallness of the sums entered for Bamborough in Henry II.'s\r\nreign might be accounted for by the labour and materials having been\r\nfurnished by the crown tenants. _Border Strongholds_, p. 236.\r\n\r\n[263] Bamborough rock has every appearance of having been once an\r\nisland. As late as 1547 the tide came right up to the rock on the east\r\nside; the sea is now separated from the castle by extensive sandhills.\r\n\r\n[264] _M. A._, v., 197.\r\n\r\n[265] _Domesday_ mentions the destruction of twenty-three houses at\r\nBarnstaple, which may have been due partly or wholly to the building of\r\nthe castle.

As\r\nRobert's coffin was actually found in the Priory in 1726, with an\r\ninscription calling him Robert de Todnei _le Fundeur_, the statement is\r\nprobably more trustworthy than documents of this class generally are.\r\n\r\n[268] Nicholls, _History of Leicester_, i., 110.\r\n\r\n[269] D.

Ang._, vi., 365.\r\n\r\n[273] It is not necessary to discuss the authenticity of the story\r\npreserved by Walter Map; it is enough that Gytha, the wife of Godwin,\r\nheld in horror the means by which her husband got possession of\r\nBerkeley Nunnery. D. B., i., 164.\r\n\r\n[274] _Mediæval Military Architecture_, i., 236.\r\n\r\n[275] The gift of the manor was made before Henry became king, and was\r\nconfirmed by charter on the death of Stephen in 1154. Fitzhardinge\r\nwas an Englishman, son of an alderman of Bristol, who had greatly\r\nhelped Henry in his wars against Stephen. See Fosbroke's _History of\r\nGloucester_.\r\n\r\n[276] He held Berkeley under the crown at the time of the Survey.

One of the most interesting\r\nfeatures in this highly interesting castle is the wooden pentice\r\nleading from the main stairway of the keep to the chamber called Edward\r\nII.'s.

A Norman seldom built or restored his\r\ncastle without doing something for the church at the same time.\r\n\r\n[297] See Ordericus, ii., 178.\r\n\r\n[298] The _Chronica de Fundatoribus of Tewkesbury Abbey_ seems to be\r\nthe origin of the tradition that Earl Robert was the builder of Bristol\r\nCastle. There can be no doubt that his work was in stone, as the same\r\nauthority states that he gave every tenth stone to the Chapel of Our\r\nLady in St James' Priory. _M. A._, ii., 120. According to Leland, the\r\nkeep was built of Caen stone. _Itin._, vii., 90.

Domesday says, \"sunt vastatæ\r\nxi. in fossa _civitatis_.\" There can be no doubt that the Chartulary\r\ngives the correct account.\r\n\r\n[323] The hill is called the Dungan, Dangon, or Dungeon Hill in many\r\nold local deeds. See \"Canterbury in Olden Times,\"_Arch. Journ._, 1856.\r\nStukeley and Grose both call it the Dungeon Hill.\r\n\r\n[324] See Appendix N.\r\n\r\n[325] Somner's _Antiquities of Canterbury_, p. 144. Published in 1640.\r\n\r\n[326] _Antiquities of Canterbury_, p. 75.\r\n\r\n[327] Mr Clark thought there was another motte in the earthworks\r\noutside the walls, though he expresses himself doubtfully: \"I rather\r\nthink they [the mounds outside the city ditch] or one of them, looked\r\nrather like a moated mound, but I could not feel sure of it.\" _Arch.\r\nCantiana_, xv., 344. Gostling (_A Walk about Canterbury_, 1825) says\r\nthere were _two_, which is perhaps explained by a passage in Brayley's\r\n_Kent_ (1808), in which he describes the external fortification as \"a\r\nlesser mount, now divided into two parts, with a ditch and embankment.\"\r\nP. 893. Stukeley's description (circa 1700) is as follows: \"Within\r\nthe walls is a very high mount, called Dungeon Hill; a ditch and high\r\nbank enclose the area before it; it seems to have been part of the old\r\ncastle. Opposite to it without the walls is a hill, seeming to have\r\nbeen raised by the Danes when they besieged the city. The top of the\r\nDungeon Hill is equal to the top of the castle.\" _Itin. Curiosum_,\r\ni., 122. It is of course not impossible that there may have been two\r\nmottes to this castle, as at Lewes and Lincoln, but such instances\r\nare rare, and it seems more likely that a portion of the bailey bank\r\nwhich happened to be in better preservation and consequently higher\r\nwas mistaken for another mount. Mr Clark committed this very error at\r\nTadcaster, and the other writers we have quoted were quite untrained\r\nas observers of earthen castles. At any rate there can be no doubt\r\nthat the Dane John is the original chief citadel of this castle,\r\nas the statements of Somner, Stukeley, and we may add, Leland, are\r\nexplicit. The most ancient maps of Canterbury, Hoefnagel's (1570),\r\nSmith's (_Description of England_, 1588), and Grose's (1785), all show\r\nthe Dungeon Hill within the walls, but take no notice of the outwork\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n[328] _Archæologia Cantiana_, xxxiii., 152.\r\n\r\n[329] _Ibid._, xxi.\r\n\r\n[330] _Close Rolls_, i., 234b, ii., 7b, 89.\r\n\r\n[331] Now, to the disgrace of the city of Canterbury, converted into\r\ngasworks.\r\n\r\n[332] For instance, at Middleham, Rochester, Rhuddlan, and Morpeth.\r\n\r\n[333] _Beauties of England and Wales, Kent_, p. 893.\r\n\r\n[334] The passages from the _Pipe Roll_ bearing on this subject (which\r\nhave not been noticed by any previous historian of Canterbury) are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n 1166-7.

The sums put down to the castle,\r\namounting to about £4000 of our money, are not sufficient to defray the\r\ncost of so fine a keep. But the entries in the _Pipe Rolls_ relate only\r\nto the Sheriff's accounts, and it is probable that the cost of the keep\r\nwas largely paid out of the revenues of the archbishopric, which Henry\r\nseized into his own hands during the Becket quarrel.\r\n\r\n[335] The portion of the wall of Canterbury, which rests on an earthen\r\nbank, extends from Northgate to the Castle, and is roughly semicircular\r\nin plan. In the middle of it was St George's Gate, which was anciently\r\ncalled _Newingate_ (Gostling, p. 53) and may possibly have been Henry\r\nII.'s new gate. The part enclosing the Dungeon Hill is angular, and\r\nappeared to Mr Clark, as well as to Somner and Hasted, to have been\r\nbrought out at this angle in order to enclose the hill.\r\n\r\n[336] _Arch.

The castle is not mentioned in Domesday under\r\nWareham, but under Kingston. \"De manerio Chingestone habet rex unam\r\nhidam, in qua fecit castellum Warham, et pro ea dedit S. Mariæ [of\r\nShaftesbury] ecclesiam de Gelingeham cum appendiciis suis.\" D. B., i.,\r\n78b, 2.\r\n\r\n[381] \"Advocatio ecclesie de Gillingeham data fuit abbati [_sic_] de\r\nS. Edwardo in escambium pro terra ubi castellum de Corf positum est.\"\r\n_Testa de Nevill_, 164b.\r\n\r\n[382] It is by no means certain that Corfe was the scene of Edward's\r\nmurder, as we learn from a charter of Cnut (_Mon. Ang._, iii., 55) that\r\nthere was a Corfe Geat not far from Portisham, probably the place now\r\ncalled Coryates.\r\n\r\n[383] Called by Asser a _castellum_; but it has already been pointed\r\nout that _castellum_ in early writers means a walled town and not a\r\ncastle. (See p. 25.) Wareham is a town fortified by an earthen vallum\r\nand ditch, and is one of the boroughs of the _Burghal Hidage_. (See Ch.\r\nII, p. 28.) A Norman castle was built there after the Conquest, and\r\nits motte still remains. D. B. says seventy-three houses were utterly\r\ndestroyed from the time of Hugh the Sheriff. I., 75.\r\n\r\n[384] Edred granted \"to the religious woman, Elfthryth,\" supposed to\r\nbe the Abbess of Shaftesbury, \"pars telluris Purbeckinga,\" which would\r\ninclude Corfe. _Mon. Ang._, ii., 478.\r\n\r\n[385] Both these kings spent large sums on Corfe Castle. See the\r\ncitations from the _Pipe Rolls_ in Hutchins' _Dorset_, vol. i., and in\r\nMr Bond's _History of Corfe Castle_.\r\n\r\n[386] See Professor Baldwin Brown's paper in the _Journal of the\r\nInstitute of British Architects_, Third Series, ii., 488, and Mr\r\nMicklethwaite's in _Arch.

Three hundred planks of oak for the works of the\r\n            castle                                               £2  0 0\r\n 1196-7.

There is no\r\nmention of stone for the castle during these two reigns, but after the\r\ndeath of John we find that works are going on at Dover for which kilns\r\nare required. (_Close Rolls_, i., 352, 1218.) This entry is followed by\r\na very large expenditure on Dover Castle (amounting to at least £6000),\r\nsufficient to cover the cost of a stone wall and towers round the outer\r\ncircuit. The orders of planks for joists must be for the towers, and\r\nthe large quantities of lead, for roofing them. The order for timber\r\n\"ad palum et alia facienda\" in 1225 _may_ refer to a stockade on the\r\nadvanced work called the Spur, which is said to be Hubert's work.\r\n(_Close Rolls_, ii., 14.)\r\n\r\n[399] Cited by Statham, _History of Dover_, pp. 265, 313.\r\n\r\n[400] _Commune of London_, pp. 278-81.\r\n\r\n[401] The ninth name, Maminot, is attached to three towers on the\r\ncurtain of the keep ward.\r\n\r\n[402] \"Recepto castro, quæ minus erant per dies octo addidit\r\nfirmamenta.\" P. 140.\r\n\r\n[403] Lyon says: \"The keep [hill] was formed of chalk dug out of the\r\ninterior hill.\" Cited by Statham, p. 245.\r\n\r\n[404] \"Per præceptum regis facta est apud Doveram turris fortissima.\"\r\nII. 8, R.

The _Historia Fundationis_ of St Martin's\r\nAbbey says that Henry II. built the high tower in the castle, and\r\nenclosed the donjon with new walls: \"fit le haut tour en le chastel, et\r\nenclost le dongon de nouelx murs.\" _M.

They are probably natural, and may have been\r\nutilised as part of the plan. The more regular terraces winding round\r\nthe motte are generally found where the motte has become part of a\r\npleasure-ground in later times.\r\n\r\n[417] This is the only case in which I have had to trust to Mr Clark\r\nfor the description of a castle. _M. M. A._, ii., 24.\r\n\r\n[418] Mentioned in _Close Rolls_, i., 518a.\r\n\r\n[419] D. B., i., 95b.\r\n\r\n[420] Symeon of Durham, 1072. \"Eodem tempore, scilicet quo rex reversus\r\nde Scotia fuerat, in Dunelmo castellum _condidit_, ubi se cum suis\r\nepiscopus tute ab incursantibus habere potuisset.\"\r\n\r\n[421] This chapel is an instance of the honour so frequently done to\r\nthe chapel, which was in many cases built of stone when the rest of\r\nthe castle was only of timber, and was always the part most lavishly\r\ndecorated.\r\n\r\n[422] The bailey was twice enlarged by Bishops Flambard and Pudsey.\r\n\r\n[423] Surtees, Durham, iv., 33.\r\n\r\n[424] Surtees Society, xx., 11-13.\r\n\r\n[425] Evidently the southern wing wall up the motte; but we need not\r\nsuppose _murus_ to mean a stone wall.\r\n\r\n[426] _Domus_, a word always used for a _habitation_ in mediæval\r\ndocuments, and often applied to a tower, which it evidently means here.\r\n\r\n[427] This is the only indication which Lawrence gives that the keep\r\nwas of wood.\r\n\r\n[428]\r\n\r\n    \"Cingitur et pulchra paries sibi quilibet ala,\r\n    Omnis et in muro desinit ala fero.\"\r\n\r\nThe translation is conjectural, but _gallery_ seems to make the best\r\nsense, and the allusion probably is to the wooden galleries, or\r\n_hourdes_, which defended the walls.\r\n\r\n[429] Evidently the northern wing wall.\r\n\r\n[430] This is the bailey; the two vast palaces must mean the hall\r\nand the lodgings of the men-at-arms, who did not share the bishop's\r\ndwelling in the keep. These were probably all of wood, as the buildings\r\nof Durham Castle were burnt at the beginning of Pudsey's episcopate\r\n(1153) and restored by him. Surtees Society, ix., 12.\r\n\r\n[431] \"Hujus in egressu pons sternitur.\" This seems a probable allusion\r\nto a drawbridge, but if so, it is an early one.\r\n\r\n[432] This describes the addition to the bailey made by Flambard. The\r\npart of the peninsula to the S. of the church was afterwards walled in\r\nby Pudsey, and called the South Bailey.\r\n\r\n[433] _Liber Eliensis_, ii., 245 (Anglia Christiana). The part cited\r\nwas written early in the 12th century: see Preface.\r\n\r\n[434] Stowe's _Annals_, 145, 1.\r\n\r\n[435] D. B., ii., 192.\r\n\r\n[436] \"Alured de Merleberge tenet castellum de Ewias de Willelmo rege.\r\nIpse rex enim concessit ei terras quas Willelmus comes ei dederat, qui\r\nhoc castellum refirmaverat, hoc est, 5 carucatas terræ ibidem.... Hoc\r\ncastellum valet 10_l_.\" D. B., i., 186a. As there is no statement of\r\nthe value in King Edward's day, we cannot tell whether it had risen or\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\n[437] _Feudal England_, p. 324. The present writer was led independently\r\nto the same conclusion. Pentecost was the nickname of Osbern, son of\r\nRichard Scrob, one of Edward's Norman favourites, to whom he had given\r\nestates in Herefordshire. Osbern fled to Scotland in 1052, but he\r\nseems to have returned, and was still holding lands in \"the castelry\r\nof Ewias\" at the time of the Survey, though his nephew Alured held the\r\ncastle. See Freeman, _N. C._, ii., 345, and _Florence of Worcester_,\r\n1052.\r\n\r\n[438] \"Locum vero intra moenia ad extruendum castellum delegit, ibique\r\nBaldwinum de Molis, filium Gisleberti comitis, aliosque milites\r\npræcipuos reliquit, qui necessarium opus conficerent, præsidioque\r\nmanerunt.\" Ordericus, ii., 181.\r\n\r\n[439] Exeter is one of the few cities where a tradition has been\r\npreserved of the site of the Saxon royal residence, which places it in\r\nwhat is now Paul Street, far away from the present castle. Shorrt's\r\n_Sylva Antiqua Iscana_, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[440] \"In hac civitate vastatæ sunt 48 domi postquam rex venit in\r\nAngliam.\" D. B., i., 100.\r\n\r\n[441] _Norman Conquest_, iv., 162.\r\n\r\n[442] The outer ditch may have been of Roman origin, but in that case\r\nit must have been carried all round the city, and we are unable to find\r\nwhether this was the case or not. The banks on the north and east sides\r\nmust also have been of Roman origin, and if we rightly understand the\r\nstatements of local antiquaries, the Roman city wall stood upon them,\r\nand has actually been found _in situ_, cased with mediæval rubble.\r\n_Report of Devon Association_, 1895.\r\n\r\n[443] This resemblance to a pit may be seen in every motte which still\r\nretains its ancient earthen breast-work, as at Castle Levington, Burton\r\nin Lonsdale, and Castlehaugh, Gisburne. Perhaps this is the reason\r\nthat we so frequently read in the _Pipe Rolls_ of \"the houses _in_ the\r\nmotte\" (domos in Mota) instead of _on_ the motte. Devizes Castle is\r\nanother and still more striking instance.\r\n\r\n[444] Professor Baldwin Brown, _The Arts in Early England_, ii., 82.\r\n\r\n[445] \"In custamento gaiole in ballia castelli, £16, 15s. 8d.\"\r\n\r\n[446] Cited by Dr Oliver, \"The Castle of Exeter,\" in _Arch.

His mother was\r\nLucy, daughter of Ivo Taillebois; and as the principal tower was known\r\nas the Luce Tower, the masonry may have been her work. In that case the\r\nNorman work on the smaller motte may be due to Ralph Gernon, and may\r\npossibly be the _nova turris_ which was repaired in John's reign. _Pipe\r\nRoll_, 2 John.

But round arches are by no means conclusive evidence in\r\nthemselves of Norman date, and the size of these windows, as well as\r\nthe absence of buttresses, and the presence of pointed arches, are\r\nquite incompatible with the early Norman period. The whole architecture\r\nof the castle agrees with a 14th century date, to which the chapel\r\nundoubtedly belongs.\r\n\r\n[553] Eyton, _Antiquities of Shropshire_, vol. vii.\r\n\r\n[554] \"Ibi fecit Rainaldus Castellum Luure.\" D.

Mr Hartshorne (_Arch. Journ._, v., 207) thought\r\nthat there had been an earlier stone keep at Peak Castle, because\r\nsome moulded stones are used in the walls, and because there is some\r\nherring-bone work in the basement. But this herring-bone work only\r\noccurs in a revetment wall to the rock in the cellar; and the moulded\r\nstones may be quite modern insertions for repairs, and may have come\r\nfrom the oratory in the N.E. angle, or from some of the ruined windows\r\nand doorways. The sums entered to this castle between the years 1172\r\nand 1176 are less than half the cost of Scarborough keep, and do not\r\nappear adequate, though the keep was a small one. But there is some\r\nreason to think that the cost of castles was occasionally defrayed in\r\npart from sources not entered in the _Pipe Rolls_.\r\n\r\n[565] Rex E. tenuit Peneverdant. Ibi 2 carucatæ terræ et reddebant 10\r\ndenarios. Modo est ibi castellum.... Valent 3 libras. D. B., i., 270.\r\n\r\n[566] We need not resort to any fanciful British origins of the name\r\nPeneverdant, as it is clearly the effort of a Norman scribe to write\r\ndown the unpronounceable English name Penwortham.\r\n\r\n[567] See _ante_, under Clitheroe.\r\n\r\n[568] Mr Halton's book (_Documents relating to the Priory of\r\nPenwortham_) throws no light on this point.\r\n\r\n[569] _Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and\r\nCheshire_, vol. ix., 1856-1857, paper on \"The Castle Hill of\r\nPenwortham,\" by the Rev. W. Thornber; Hardwick's _History of Preston_,\r\npp. 103-11.\r\n\r\n[570] In a paper published in the _Trans. Soc. Ant. Scot_, for 1900, on\r\n\"Anglo-Saxon Burhs and Early Norman Castles,\" the present writer was\r\nmisled into the statement that this hut was the remains of the cellar\r\nof the Norman _bretasche_. A subsequent study of Mr Hardwick's more\r\nlucid account of the excavations showed that this was an error. There\r\nwere two pavements of boulders, one on the natural surface of the hill,\r\non which the hut had been built, the other 5 feet above it, and 12 feet\r\nbelow the present surface. The hut appeared to have been circular, with\r\nwattled walls and a thatched roof. Several objects were found in its\r\nremains, and were pronounced to be Roman or Romano-British. The upper\r\npavement would probably be the flooring of a Norman keep.\r\n\r\n[571] Mr Roach Smith pronounced this spur to be Norman. As its evidence\r\nis so important, it is to be regretted that its position was not more\r\naccurately observed. It was found in the lowest stratum of the remains,\r\nbut Mr Hardwick says: \"As it was not observed until thrown to the\r\nsurface, a possibility remained that it might have fallen from the\r\nlevel of the upper boulder pavement, 5 feet higher.\" We may regard this\r\npossibility as a certainty, if the lower hut was really British.\r\n\r\n[572] Mr Willoughby Gardner says the castle commands a ford, to which\r\nthe ancient sunk road leads. _Victoria Hist. of Lancashire_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[573] Hugh Candidus, _Coenob. Burg. Historia_, in Sparke's _Scriptores_,\r\np. 63. This passage was kindly pointed out to me by Mr Round. Hugh\r\nlived in Henry III.'s reign, but he must have had the more ancient\r\nrecords of the monastery at his disposal.\r\n\r\n[574] Domesday Book mentions that the value of the burgus had greatly\r\nrisen. It was one of the _burhs_ mentioned in the _Burghal Hidage_.\r\n\r\n[575] _Pipe Roll_, 1187-1188. William of Jumièges says, \"Statim\r\nfirmissimo vallo castrum condidit, probisque militibus commisit.\" VII.,\r\n34. Wace professes to give the account of an eye-witness, who saw\r\nthe timber for the castle landed from the ships, and the ditch dug.\r\nBut Wace was not a contemporary, and as he has made the mistake of\r\nmaking William land at Pevensey instead of Hastings, his evidence is\r\nquestionable. _Roman de Rou_, p. 293 (Andresen's edition).\r\n\r\n[576] The ruins of this keep, until 1908, were buried under so large a\r\nmound of earth and rubbish that Mr G. T. Clark mistook it for a motte,\r\nand the present writer was equally misled. It ought to be stated,\r\nbefore the date of this keep is finally settled, that the _Gesta\r\nStephani_ speaks of this castle as \"editissimo aggere sublatum.\" P. 106.\r\n\r\n[577] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[578] _Close Rolls_, i., 631a.\r\n\r\n[579] D.

Quoted in Holmes' _Manual of\r\nPontefract Castle_.\r\n\r\n[588] In the _English Historical Review_ for July 1904, where this\r\npaper first appeared, the writer spoke of _two_ mottes at Pontefract,\r\nhaving been led to this view by the great height of the east end of the\r\nbailey, where the ruins of John of Gaunt's work are found.

B., i., 381a, 2.\r\n\r\n[602] This is stated in a charter of Henry II., which carefully\r\nrecapitulates the gifts of the different benefactors to St Mary's.\r\n_Mon. Ang._, iii., 548. It is curious that the charter of William II.,\r\nthe first part of which is an inspeximus of a charter of William I.,\r\ndoes not mention this chapel in the castle.\r\n\r\n[603] Mr Skaife, the editor of the _Yorkshire Domesday_, thinks that\r\nit was at Hinderlag, but gives no reasons. Hinderlag, at the time of\r\nthe Survey, was in the hands of an under-tenant. _Yorks. Arch. Journ._,\r\nlii., 527, 530.\r\n\r\n[604] \"Hic Alanus primo incepit facere castrum et munitionem juxta\r\nmanerium suum capitale de Gilling, pro tuitione suorum contra\r\ninfestationes Anglorum tunc ubique exhæredatorum, similiter et Danorum,\r\net nominavit dictum castrum Richmond suo ydiomate Gallico, quod sonat\r\nLatine divitem montem, in editiori et fortiori loco sui territorii\r\nsituatum.\" _Mon. Ang._, v., 574.\r\n\r\n[605] There are no remains of fortification at Gilling, but about a\r\nmile and a half away there used to be an oval earthwork, now levelled,\r\ncalled Castle Hill, of which a plan is given in M'Laughlan's paper,\r\n_Arch. Journ._, vol. vi. It had no motte. Mr Clark says, \"The mound at\r\nGilling has not long been levelled.\" _M. M. A._, i., 23.

Cantiana_, vol.\r\nxvii.). The oldest form of the name is Bullie Hill, as in Edward IV.'s\r\ncharter, cited below, p. 200.\r\n\r\n[616] Roman urns and lachrymatories were found in the Boley Hill when\r\nit was partially levelled in the 18th century to fill up the castle\r\nditch. _History of Rochester_, p. 281. At the part now called Watt's\r\nAvenue, Mr George Payne found \"the fag-end of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery.\"\r\n_Arch.

Mr Freeman and others have noticed that the special mention of\r\na _stone_ castle makes it probable that the first castle was of wood.\r\nMr Round remarks that the building of Rochester Castle is fixed, by the\r\nconjunction of William II. and Lanfranc in its history, to some date\r\nbetween September 1087 and March 1089. _Geoffrey de Mandeville_, p.\r\n339. Probably, therefore, it was this new castle which Bishop Odo held\r\nagainst Rufus in 1088. Ordericus says that \"cum quingentis militibus\r\nintra Rofensem urbem se conclusit.\" P. 272.\r\n\r\n[618] It is now attributed to Archbishop William of Corbeuil, to whom\r\nHenry I. gave the custody of the castle in the twenty-seventh year of\r\nhis reign, with permission to make within it a defence or keep, such as\r\nhe might please. _Continuator of Florence_, 1126. Gervase of Canterbury\r\nalso says \"idem episcopus turrim egregiam ædificavit.\" Both passages\r\nare cited by Hartshorne, _Arch. Journ._, xx., 211. Gundulf's castle\r\ncost 60_l._ and can scarcely have been more than an enclosing wall with\r\nperhaps one mural tower. See Mr Round, _Geoffrey de Mandeville_, 340,\r\nand Mr Livett's paper, cited above.\r\n\r\n[619] Two common friends of Rufus and Gundulf advised the king that\r\nin return for the grant of the manor of Hedenham and the remission\r\nof certain moneys, \"episcopus Gundulfus, quia in opere cæmentario\r\nplurimum sciens et efficax erat, castrum sibi Hrofense _lapideum_ de\r\nsuo construeret.\" _Textus Roffensis_, p. 146. There was therefore an\r\nexchange of land in this affair also.\r\n\r\n[620] _Arch. Cantiana_, vol. xxi.\r\n\r\n[621] _Arch. Cantiana_, vol. xxi., p. 49.\r\n\r\n[622] There are several entries in the _Close Rolls_ relating to this\r\nwall of Henry III. in the year 1225.\r\n\r\n[623] Mr Beale Poste says that this ancient wall was met with some\r\nyears since in digging the foundations of the Rev. Mr Conway's house,\r\nstanding parallel to the present brick walls and about 2 feet within\r\nthem. \"Ancient Rochester as a Roman Station,\" _Arch. Cantiana_, ii.,\r\n71. The Continuator of Gervase of Canterbury tells us (ii., 235) that\r\nat the siege of Rochester in 1265, Simon de Montfort captured the outer\r\ncastle up to the keep (forinsecum castellum usque ad turrim), and Mr\r\nLivett thinks this outer castle must have been the Boley Hill.\r\n\r\n[624] _Close Rolls_, ii., 98b.\r\n\r\n[625] Hasted's _Kent_, iv., 163.\r\n\r\n[626] \"Ymb sætan tha ceastre and worhton other fæsten ymb hie selfe.\"\r\nSee _ante_, p. 49, _note 120_.\r\n\r\n[627] Mr Hope suggests the east side, as the north was a marsh.\r\n\r\n[628] _History of Rochester_ (published by Fisher, 1772), p. 285.\r\n\r\n[629] D.

Sir Richard made a vague reference\r\nto an MS. in the Cottonian and Bodleian libraries, for which Mr Irving\r\nsays he has searched in vain.\r\n\r\n[636] General Pitt-Rivers in his Address to the Salisbury meeting\r\nof the Archæological Institute in 1887, says that traces of these\r\nroads may still be seen. He adds that Old Sarum does not resemble the\r\ngenerality of ancient British fortifications, in that the rampart is\r\nof the same height all round, instead of being lower where the ground\r\nis steeper; this led him to think that the original fortress had been\r\nmodernised in later times. Sir Richard Colt Hoare noticed that the\r\nramparts of Sarum were twice as high as those of the fine prehistoric\r\ncamps with which he was acquainted. _Ancient Wiltshire_, p. 226.\r\n\r\n[637] Benson and Hatcher's _Old and New Sarum_, p. 604.\r\n\r\n[638] _Cf._ Benson and Hatcher, 63, with _Beauties of England and\r\nWales_, xv., 78.\r\n\r\n[639] D.

This in itself is a\r\nproof that the castle was new. See Freeman, _N. C._, iv., 797.\r\n\r\n[640] This policy had been dictated by an oecumenical council.\r\n\r\n[641] He gives to the canons of the church two hides in the manor,\r\n\"et ante portam castelli Seriberiensis terram ex utraque parte viæ in\r\nortorum domorumque canonicorum necessitate.\" _M.

It is clear from several of the documents given by Mr\r\nMazzinghi that the king's gaol of Stafford and the king's gaol of the\r\ncastle of Stafford are equivalent expressions.\r\n\r\n[680] _Pipe Rolls_, 2 John.\r\n\r\n[681] _Close Rolls_, i., 69.\r\n\r\n[682] _Constitutional History_, i., 272.\r\n\r\n[683] Cited in _Salt Arch.

The mistake may possibly have\r\narisen from the fact that a fine castellated gateway, shown in W.\r\nSmith's map (_Description of England_), stood on the south-west wall of\r\nthe town, close to the spot where Speed's map marks a Castle Hill.\r\n\r\n[690] There must be some error in the first statement of the Stafford\r\nrevenue in Domesday, which says that the king and earl have 7_l._\r\nbetween them, as it is contradicted by the later statement.

Ordericus is quoting from William\r\nof Poitiers. There was formerly a Roman camp at Barking, and the motte\r\nwhich William hastily threw up on its rampart to defend his sojourn\r\nstill remains. See _Victoria History of Essex_.\r\n\r\n[711] Mr Harold Sands suggests to me that the first fortification may\r\nsimply have been a bank and palisade across the angle of the Roman\r\nwall, with perhaps a wooden keep, and that the great fire in London in\r\n1077 determined William to build a stone keep.\r\n\r\n[712] Hearne's _Textus Roffensis_, 212. \"Idem Gundulfus, ex precepto\r\nRegis Willielmi Magni, præesset operi magnæ turris Londoniæ.\"\r\n\r\n[713] The building of stone keeps was generally spread over several\r\nyears, as we learn from the _Pipe Rolls_. Richard I. built his\r\ncelebrated keep of Chateau Gaillard in one year, but he himself\r\nregarded this as an architectural feat. \"Estne bella, filia mea de uno\r\nanno,\" he said in delight.\r\n\r\n[714] _A.-S. C._ in _anno_.\r\n\r\n[715] Round's _History of Colchester_, ch. iv.\r\n\r\n[716] The keep of Norwich Castle measures 100 × 95 feet; Middleham, 100\r\n× 80; Dover, 95 × 90. These are the largest existing keeps in England,\r\nnext to the Tower and Colchester. The destroyed keep of Duffield\r\nmeasured 99 × 93 feet; that of Bristol is believed to have been 110 ×\r\n95.\r\n\r\n[717] The reader will find little help for the structural history of\r\nthe Tower in most of the works which call themselves Histories of the\r\nTower of London. The plan of these works generally is to skim over the\r\nstructural history as quickly as possible, perhaps with the help of a\r\nfew passages from Clark, and to get on to the history of the prisoners\r\nin the Tower. For the description in the text, the writer is greatly\r\nindebted to Mr Harold Sands, F.S.A., who has made a careful study of\r\nthe Tower, and whose monograph upon it, it is hoped, will shortly\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n[718] _Ante_, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[719] Many of the larger keeps contain rooms quite spacious enough to\r\nhave served as banqueting halls, and it is a point of some difficulty\r\nwhether they were built to be used as such. But as late as the 14th\r\ncentury, Piers Ploughman rebukes the new custom which was growing up of\r\nthe noble and his family taking their meals in private, and leaving the\r\nhall to their retainers. Every castle seems to have had a hall in the\r\nbailey.\r\n\r\n[720] Mr Sands says the main floors are not of too great a span to\r\ncarry any ordinary weight.\r\n\r\n[721] The keep of Pevensey Castle, the basement of which has been\r\nrecently uncovered, has no less than four apsidal projections, one of\r\nwhich rests on the solid base of a Roman mural tower. But this keep is\r\nquite an exceptional building. See _Excavations at Pevensey_, Second\r\nReport, by H. Sands.\r\n\r\n[722] Mr Sands has conjectured that the third floor may be an addition,\r\nand that the second storey was originally open up to the roof and\r\nnot communicating with the mural passage except by stairs. This was\r\nactually the case at Bamborough keep, and at Newcastle and Rochester\r\nthe mural gallery opens into the upper part of the second storey by\r\ninner windows.\r\n\r\n[723] Until the end of the 12th century the roofs of keeps were gabled\r\nand not flat, but probably there was usually a parapet walk for\r\nsentinels or archers.\r\n\r\n[724] Parts of these walls, running N. and S. have been found very near\r\nthe E. side of the Tower. No trace of the Roman wall has been found S.\r\nof the Tower, but in Lower Thames Street lines have been found which,\r\nif produced, would lead straight to the S. wall of the inner bailey.\r\nCommunicated by Mr Harold Sands.\r\n\r\n[725] I have to thank Mr Harold Sands for kindly revising this account\r\nof the Tower.\r\n\r\n[726] \"Ibi habet comes unum castrum et mercatum, reddentes 101s.\" D.\r\nB., i., 122.\r\n\r\n[727] It must be remembered that round arches, in castle architecture,\r\nare by no means a certain sign of date. Of course the first castle on\r\nthis motte must have been of wood.\r\n\r\n[728] _Ord. Vit._, ii., 222 (Prévost).\r\n\r\n[729] \"Henricus de Ferrers habet castellum de Toteberie.

The castle was then besieged on Henry's behalf\r\nby the vassal prince of South Wales, the Lord Rhys.\r\n\r\n[733] The foundation charter is in _Mon. Ang._, iii., 393.\r\n\r\n[734] _A.-S.

Pro castello\r\nsunt 8 destructæ.\" D. B., i., 56. If we divide these 276 _haughs_\r\nby the 114 acres enclosed by the town rampart, we get an average of\r\nabout 1 rood 26 perches for each haugh; multiply this by 8 (the number\r\ndestroyed for the castle) and we get an area of 3 acres, which is about\r\nthe average area of an early Norman castle.\r\n\r\n[739] Hedges, _History of Wallingford_, i., 139.\r\n\r\n[740] Camden speaks of the motte as being in the middle of the castle,\r\nbut this is a mistake.\r\n\r\n[741] Such is the account in Hedges' _History of Wallingford_, p. 139,\r\nbut it sounds odd. It is to be inferred from the same source that the\r\nfragment of a round building which stands on the top of the motte must\r\nbe modern; it is thick enough to be ancient.\r\n\r\n[742] _Close Rolls_, i., anno 1223.\r\n\r\n[743] D.

As _domus_ is a word very\r\ncommonly used for a keep, it is probable this expenditure refers to a\r\nwooden keep.\r\n\r\n[750] From information received from Mr Harold Sands. There appears to\r\nbe no foundation whatever for the curious ground plan given by Parker.\r\n\r\n[751] See _ante_, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[752] \"Willelmus comes fecit illud castellum in wasta terra quæ vocatur\r\nMereston.\" D. B., i., 183.\r\n\r\n[753] _Mon.

The\r\n_intra moenia_ is not to be taken literally, any more than the _mari\r\ncontiguæ_. It is strange that Mr Freeman should have mistaken Guenta\r\nfor Norwich, since under 1067 Ordericus translates the Winchester of\r\nthe A.-S. C. by Guenta.\r\n\r\n[756] \"De isto manerio testatur comitatus quod injuste accepit [abbas]\r\npro excambio domus regis, quia domus erat regis.\" D.

Inst._, Winchester volume, p. 51.\r\n\r\n[762] It should also be said that the word _domus_ is frequently used\r\nfor a keep in chronicles and ancient documents of the 11th and 12th\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n[763] The line of the more ancient roof gable can be traced in the\r\nnorth wall, and there is a vestige of a Norman doorway in the east wall.\r\n\r\n[764] _History of Winchester_, ii., 210.\r\n\r\n[765] Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen,\r\npulled down the royal palace close to the cathedral, which presumably\r\nwas the old Saxon palace, and used the materials to build Wolvesey\r\nCastle. See Malmesbury, \"De Vitis Sex Episcoporum,\" _Anglia Sacra_,\r\nii., 421. He could hardly have dared to do this if the palace had still\r\nbeen used by the Norman kings.\r\n\r\n[766] _History of Winchester_, ii., 210. See Fig. 37.\r\n\r\n[767] _Ibid._, p. 195. It is difficult, now that the area has been\r\nlevelled, to say exactly where this motte stood. Woodward says that the\r\nkeep stood in the N.E. corner; but he probably alludes to a mural tower\r\nwhose foundations can still be seen, near the County Hall. _History of\r\nHampshire_, i., 295-304.\r\n\r\n[768] Turner, _History of Domestic Architecture_. He cites from the\r\n_Liberate Roll_, 35 Henry II., an order for the repair of the ditch\r\nbetween the great tower and the bailey.\r\n\r\n[769] \"Radulfus filius Seifrid tenet de rege Clivor. Heraldus comes\r\ntenuit. Tunc se defendebat pro 5 hidis, modo pro 4-1/2 hidis, et\r\ncastellum de Windesores est in dimidia hida.\" D. B., i., 62b. The\r\n_Abingdon History_ also mentions the foundation of Windsor Castle and\r\ngives some interesting details about castle guard. \"Tunc Walingaforde\r\net Oxenforde et Wildesore, cæterisque locis, castella pro regno\r\nservando compacta.

Until recently there was a farmhouse surrounded by a moat at Old\r\nWindsor, which was _believed_ to mark the site of Edward's _regia\r\ndomus_.\r\n\r\n[771] Edward's grant of Windsor to Westminster is in _Cod. Dip._, iv.,\r\n227. Domesday does not mention the rights of the church, but says the\r\nmanor of Windsor was held of the crown T. R. E. and T. R. W. Camden\r\ngives William's charter of exchange with the convent of Westminster.\r\n_Britannia_, i., 151.\r\n\r\n[772] This is stated in the charter given by Camden.\r\n\r\n[773] In 1 virgata terræ quam Willelmus fil. Walteri habet in escambio\r\npro terra sua quæ capta est ad burgum. P. 721.\r\n\r\n[774] The _Red Book of the Exchequer_, which contains an abstract of\r\nthe missing _Pipe Roll_ of 1 Henry II., has an entry of 12_s._ paid to\r\nRichard de Clifwar for the exchange of his land, and regular payments\r\nare made later. There was another enlargement of the bailey in Henry\r\nIII.'s reign, but the second bailey was then existing.

Mr Hope informs\r\nme that this can only refer to the northern part of the ditch, as the\r\neastern portion was only filled up in 1824. Mr Hope thinks that the\r\ncastle area has always included the lower bailey.

Mr Freeman has worked out the course\r\nof events connected with the building and destruction of the castles\r\nwith his usual lucidity.

Although\r\nAthelstan destroyed the fortifications of this borough, they were\r\nevidently renewed when the Danish earls took up their residence there,\r\nfor when Earl Alan persuaded the monks from Whitby to settle there one\r\ninducement which he offered was the fortification of the site, \"loci\r\nmunitionem.\" _Mon.

Under the year 1193, after relating the tragedy of the Jews at York\r\nCastle, Hoveden says: \"Deinde idem cancellarius [William de Longchamp]\r\ntradidit Osberto de Lunchamp, fratri suo, comitatum Eboracensem in\r\ncustodia, et precepit firmari castellum in veteri castellario quod\r\nRex Willelmus Rufus ibi construxerat.\" III., 34, R. S. The expression\r\n_vetus castellarium_ would lead us to think of the Old Baile, which\r\ncertainly had this name from an early period; and Hoveden, being a\r\nYorkshireman as well as a very accurate writer, was probably aware of\r\nthe difference between the two castles. But if he meant the Old Baile,\r\nthen both the castles were restored at about the same time. \"Rufus\"\r\nmust be a slip, unless there was some rebuilding in Rufus' reign of\r\nwhich we do not know.\r\n\r\n[806] Messrs Benson and Platnauer are of the former opinion. \"The\r\nexistence of a second layer of timber seems to show that the\r\nfortification destroyed was rebuilt in wood.\" _Notes on Clifford's\r\nTower_, p. 2.\r\n\r\n[807] \"Pro mairemio castri Ebor. prostrato per ventum colligendo,\r\n2_s._\" _Pipe Roll_, 19 Henry III. It is, of course, a conjecture that\r\nthis accident happened to the keep; but the keep would be the part most\r\nexposed to the wind, and the _scattering_ of the timber, so that it had\r\nto be collected, is just what would happen if a timber structure were\r\nblown off a motte.\r\n\r\n[808] As the writer was the first to publish this statement, it will\r\nbe well to give the evidence on which it rests. The keep of York is\r\nclearly Early English in style, and of an early phase of the style. It\r\nis, however, evident to every one who has carefully compared our dated\r\nkeeps, that castle architecture always lags behind church architecture\r\nin style-development, and must be judged by different standards. We\r\nshould therefore be prepared to find this and most other keeps to be\r\nof later date than their architecture would suggest. Moreover, the\r\nexpenditure entered to York Castle in the reigns of Henry II., Richard\r\nI., and John, is quite insufficient to cover the cost of a stone keep.\r\nThe _Pipe Rolls_ of Henry III.'s reign decide the matter, as they show\r\nthe sums which he expended annually on this castle. It is true they\r\nnever mention the _turris_, but always the _castrum_; we must also\r\nadmit that the _turris_ and _castrum_ are often distinguished in the\r\nwrits, even as late as Edward III.'s reign. (_Close Rolls_, 1334.) On\r\nthe other hand extensive acquaintance with the _Pipe Rolls_ proves that\r\nthough the mediæval scribe may have an occasional fit of accuracy, he\r\nis generally very loose in his use of words, and his distinctions must\r\nnever be pressed. Take, for instance, the case of Orford, where the\r\nword used in the _Pipe Rolls_ is always _castellum_, but it certainly\r\nrefers to the keep, as there are no other buildings at Orford. Other\r\ninstances might be given in which the word _castellum_ clearly applies\r\nto the keep. It should be mentioned that in 1204 John gave an order\r\nfor stone for the castle (_Close Rolls_, i., 4b), but the amounts on\r\nthe bill for it in the _Pipe Rolls_ show that it was not used for any\r\nextensive building operations.\r\n\r\n[809] \"Mandatum est Galterio de Cumpton forestario de Gauteris quod\r\nad pontem et domos castri Eboraci et breccas palicii ejusdem castri\r\nreparandos et emendandos Vicecomitem Eboraci mæremium habere faciat in\r\nforesta de Gauteris per visum, etc.\" _Close Rolls_, ii., 61b.\r\n\r\n[810] Order to expend up to 6 marks in repairing the wooden peel about\r\nthe keep of York Castle, which peel is now fallen down. _Cal. of Close\r\nRolls,_ 17 Edward II., 25.\r\n\r\n[811] _Cal. of Close Rolls_, 1313-1318, 262. _Mota_ is wrongly\r\ntranslated _moat_.\r\n\r\n[812] See Mr Cooper's _York: The Story of its Walls and Castles_.\r\nDuring Messrs Benson and Platnauer's excavations, a prehistoric\r\ncrouching burial was found in the ground below the motte, 4 feet 6\r\ninches under the present level.

I am\r\nindebted to Mr Cooper's courtesy for some of the extracts cited above\r\nrelating to York Castle.\r\n\r\n[818] Cooper's _York_, chapters ii. and iv. 100_l_. was spent by the\r\nsheriff in fortifying the walls of York in the sixth year of Henry III.\r\nAfter this there are repeated grants for murage in the same and the\r\nfollowing reign. There are some Early English buttresses in the walls,\r\nbut the majority are later. No part of the walls contains Norman work.\r\n\r\n[819] The details of this evidence, which consist mainly in (1) a\r\nstructural difference in the extended rampart; (2) a subsidence in the\r\nground marking the old line of the city ditch, will be found in Mr\r\nCooper's work, p. 224.\r\n\r\n[820] \"Locum in Eboraco qui dicitur Vetus Ballium, primo spissis et\r\nlongis 18 pedum tabulis, secundo lapideo muro fortiter includebat.\" T.\r\nStubbs, in Raine's _Historians of the Church of York_, ii., 417, R.

The MS. of\r\nthe _Leges Wallicæ_ is not earlier than the 13th century. The other\r\neditions of the Laws are even later. See Wade Evans, _Welsh Mediæval\r\nLaw_, for the most recent criticism of the Laws of Howel Dda.\r\n\r\n[827] The _Leges Wallicæ_ say: \"Villani regis debent facere novem domos\r\nad opus regis; scilicet, aulam, cameram, coquinam, penu (capellam),\r\nstabulum, kynorty (stabulum canum), horreum, odyn (siccarium) et\r\nlatrinam.\" P. 791.\r\n\r\n[828] The word Din or Dinas, so often used for a fort in Wales, is\r\ncognate with the German _Zaun_, Anglo-Saxon _tun_, and means a fenced\r\nplace. Neither it nor the Irish form dun have any connection with the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _dun_, a hill. See J. E. Lloyd, _Welsh Place-names_, \"Y\r\nCymmrodor,\" xi., 24.\r\n\r\n[829] It is doubtful whether Deheubarth ever included the small\r\nindependent states of Gwent, Brecknock, and Glamorgan.\r\n\r\n[830] \"Wales and the Coming of the Normans,\" _Cymmrodorion Trans._,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\n[831] There is an earthwork near Portskewet, a semicircular cliff camp\r\nwith three ramparts and two ditches.

It and the _Annales Cambriæ_ have\r\nbeen disgracefully edited for the _Rolls_ Series, and the topographical\r\nstudent will find no help from these editions. See Mr Phillimore's\r\ncriticism of them, in _Y Cymmrodor,_ vol. xi. The Aberpergwm MS. of\r\nthe _Brut_, known also as the _Gwentian Chronicle_, has been printed\r\nin the _Archæologia Cambrensis_ for 1864; it contains a great deal of\r\nadditional information, but as Mr Phillimore observes, so much of it is\r\nforgery that none of it can be trusted when unsupported.\r\n\r\n[834] The barbarity on both sides was frightful, but in the case of\r\nthe Welsh, it was often their own countrymen, and even near relations,\r\nwho were the victims. And so little patriotism existed then in Wales\r\nthat the Normans could always find allies amongst some of the Welsh\r\nchieftains. Patriotism, however, is a virtue of more recent growth than\r\nthe 11th century.\r\n\r\n[835] There is, however, no contemporary evidence for the existence of\r\nthe Marcher lordships before the end of the 12th century. See Duckett\r\n\"On the Marches of Wales,\" _Arch. Camb._, 1881.\r\n\r\n[836] The districts of Cyfeiliog and Arwystli, in the centre of Wales,\r\nwere also reckoned in Gwynedd.\r\n\r\n[837] \"Wales and the Coming of the Normans,\" _Cymmrodorion Trans._,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\n[838] In the descriptions of castles in this chapter, those which have\r\nnot been specially visited for this work are marked with an asterisk.\r\nThose which have been visited by others than the writer are marked with\r\ninitials: D. H. M. being Mr D. H. Montgomerie, F.S.A.; B. T. S., Mr\r\nBasil T. Stallybrass; and H. W., the Rev.

The word is still used locally.\r\n_Cf._ Christison, _Early Fortifications in Scotland_, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[842] Such presentations of abandoned castle sites, and of old wooden\r\ncastles, to the church, were not uncommon. We have seen how the\r\nsite of Montacute Castle was given to the Cluniac monks (_ante_, p.\r\n170). Thicket Priory, in Yorkshire, occupied the site of the castle\r\nof Wheldrake; and William de Albini gave the site and materials of\r\nthe old castle of Buckenham, in Norfolk, to the new castle which he\r\nfounded there. The materials, but not the site, of the wooden castle of\r\nMontferrand were given in Stephen's reign to Meaux Abbey, and served to\r\nbuild some of the monastic offices. _Chron. de Melsa_, i., 106.\r\n\r\n[843] \"Fines suos dilatavit, et in monte Dagannoth, qui mari contiguus\r\nest, fortissimum castellum condidit.\" _Ordericus_, iii., 284 (edition\r\nPrévost). The verb _condere_ is never used except for a new foundation.\r\n\r\n[844] The _Brut_ says that in the year 823 the Saxons destroyed the\r\n_Castle_ of Deganwy. This is one of the only two instances in which\r\nthe word _castell_ is used in this Welsh chronicle before the coming\r\nof the Normans. As the MS. is not earlier than the 14th century it\r\nwould be idle to claim this as a proof of the existence of a castle at\r\nthis period. _Castell_, in Welsh, is believed to have come straight\r\nfrom the Latin, and was applied to any kind of fortress. Lloyd, _Welsh\r\nPlace-names_, \"Y Cymmrodor,\" xi., 28.\r\n\r\n[845] The \"new castle of Aberconwy\" mentioned by the _Brut_ in 1211,\r\nundoubtedly means this new stone castle built by the earl at Deganwy,\r\nas the castle of Conway did not then exist.\r\n\r\n[846] See Pennant, ii., 151; and _Arch. Camb._, 1891, p. 321.\r\n\r\n[847] _Brut of Tywysogion_, 1145.\r\n\r\n[848] Published with a Latin translation in _Arch. Camb._, 1866. \"He\r\nbuilt castles in various places, after the manner of the French, in\r\norder that he might better hold the country.\"\r\n\r\n[849] The _Brut_ also mentions the castle of Aberlleinog, and says it\r\nwas built in 1096; _rebuilt_ would have been more correct, as the \"Life\r\nof Griffith ap Cynan\" shows that it was built by the Earl of Chester,\r\nand burnt by Griffith, before the expedition of 1096 (really 1098),\r\nwhen Hugh, Earl of Shrewsbury, met with his death on the shore near\r\nthis castle, from an arrow shot by King Magnus Barefoot, who came to\r\nthe help of the Welsh.\r\n\r\n[850] Mr Hartshorne in his paper on Carnarvon Castle (_Arch. Journ._,\r\nvii.) cites a document stating that a wall 18 perches long had been\r\nbegun _round the moat_ [possibly _motam_; original not given]. He also\r\ncites from the _Pipe Rolls_ an item for wages to _carriers of earth dug\r\nout of the castle_.\r\n\r\n[851] This ruined wall runs in a straight line through the wood on the\r\nridge to the east of the town; at one place it turns at right angles;\r\nat the back of the golf pavilion is a portion still erect, showing that\r\nit was a dry built wall of very ordinary character.\r\n\r\n[852] Roman masonry has been exposed in the bank of the station.\r\n\r\n[853] _Life of Griffith ap Cynan_; Brut, 1111.\r\n\r\n[854] _Arch.

This of course is quite possible, but I do not see\r\nthat there is sufficient evidence for it. See _Eng. Hist.

It also is\r\non a motte.\r\n\r\n[891] I am indebted for this identification to the kindness of Mr A. N.\r\nPalmer of Wrexham.\r\n\r\n[892] D. B., i., 254. The manor is called Gal.

There is a farmhouse called Rhyd y Gors about\r\na mile lower down than Carmarthen, and on the opposite side are some\r\nembankments; but I am assured by Mr Spurrell of Carmarthen that these\r\nare only river-embankments.

Under 1209\r\nit says, \"Gelart seneschal of Gloucester fortified (cadarnhaaod) the\r\ncastle of Builth.\" We can never be certain whether the word which\r\nis translated _fortified_, whether from the Welsh or from the Latin\r\n_firmare_, means built originally or rebuilt.\r\n\r\n[963] _Beauties of England and Wales_, \"Brecknockshire,\" p. 153.\r\n\r\n[964] _Brut_, in _anno_.

There is\r\nanother site which may possibly be that of Castle Remni: Castleton,\r\nwhich is nearly 2 miles from the river, but is on the main road from\r\nCardiff to Newport. \"It was formerly a place of strength and was\r\nprobably built or occupied by the Normans for the purpose of retaining\r\ntheir conquest of Wentlwg. The only remains are a barrow in the garden\r\nof Mr Philipps, which is supposed to have been the site of the citadel,\r\nand a stone barn, once a chapel.\" Coxe's _Monmouthshire_, i., 63.\r\n\r\n[989] It is right to say that Colonel Morgan in his admirable _Survey\r\nof East Gower_ (a model of what an antiquarian survey ought to be) does\r\nnot connect this mound with the old castle which is mentioned, as well\r\nas the new castle, in Cromwell's Survey of Gower. But even the old\r\ncastle seems to have been Edwardian (see the plan, p. 85), so it is\r\nquite possible there were three successive castles in Swansea.\r\n\r\n[990] _Brut_, 1113.\r\n\r\n[991] Morgan's _Survey of East Gower_, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[992] Colonel Morgan's _Survey of East Gower_.\r\n\r\n[993] Lewis's _Topographical Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n[994] The passage of the river Lune in Lancashire is similarly defended\r\nby the mottes of Melling and Arkholme.\r\n\r\n[995] The dates given are those of the _Brut_, and probably two years\r\ntoo early.\r\n\r\n[996] Meyrick's _History of Cardigan_, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[997] Meyrick's _History of Cardigan_, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[998] Lewis's _Topographical Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n[999] We do not include the castles which the Welsh _re_built. Thus\r\nin 1194 we are told that Rhys built the castle of Kidwelly, which he\r\ncertainly only rebuilt.\r\n\r\n[1000] Malcolm Canmore himself had passed nearly fourteen years in\r\nEngland. Fordun, iv., 45.\r\n\r\n[1001] Burton remarks: \"To the Lowland Scot, as well as to the Saxon,\r\nthe Norman was what a clever man, highly educated and trained in the\r\ngreat world of politics, is to the same man who has spent his days in a\r\nvillage.\" _History of Scotland_, i., 353.\r\n\r\n[1002] Dr Round has brought to light the significant fact that King\r\nDavid took his chancellor straight from the English chancery, where he\r\nhad been a clerk. This first chancellor of Scotland was the founder of\r\nthe great Comyn family. _The Ancestor_, 10, 108.\r\n\r\n[1003] Fordun, _Annalia_, vol. iv.\r\n\r\n[1004] It is tempting to connect the extraordinary preponderance of\r\nmottes, as shown by Dr Christison's map, in the shires which made up\r\nancient Galloway (Wigton, Kirkcudbright, and Dumfries) with the savage\r\nresistance offered by Galloway, which may have made it necessary for\r\nall the Norman under-tenants to fortify themselves, each in his own\r\nmotte-castle. It is wiser, however, to delay such speculations until\r\nwe have the more exact information as to the number of mottes in\r\nScotland, which it is hoped will be furnished when the Royal Commission\r\non Historical Monuments has finished its work. But this work will not\r\nbe complete unless special attention is paid to the earthworks which\r\nnow form part of stone castles, and which are too often overlooked,\r\neven by antiquaries. The _New Statistical Account_ certainly raises\r\nthe suspicion that there are many more mottes north of the Forth than\r\nare recognised in the map alluded to. In one district we are told that\r\n\"almost every farm had its _knap_.\" \"Forfarshire,\" p. 326.\r\n\r\n[1005] Cited by Fordun, v., 43.\r\n\r\n[1006] Benedict of Peterborough, i., 68, R. S.\r\n\r\n[1007] Fordun, v., 26. Bower in one of his interpolations to Fordun's\r\nAnnals, tells how a Highlander named Gillescop burnt certain wooden\r\ncastles (_quasdam munitiones ligneas_) in Moray. Skene's Fordun, ii.,\r\n435.\r\n\r\n[1008] That Fordun should speak of the _castra_ and _municipia_ of\r\nMacduff is not surprising, seeing that he wrote in the 14th century,\r\nwhen a noble without a castle was a thing unthinkable.\r\n\r\n[1009] Burton actually thought that the Normans built no castles in\r\nScotland in the 12th century. Messrs MacGibbon and Ross remark that\r\nthere is not one example of civil or military architecture of the 12th\r\ncentury, while there are so many fine specimens of ecclesiastical.\r\n_Castellated Architecture of Scotland_, i., 63. It is just to add\r\nthat when speaking of the castles of William the Lion, they say: \"It\r\nis highly probable that these and other castles of the 13th century\r\nwere of the primeval kind, consisting of palisaded earthen mounds and\r\nditches.\" _Ibid._, iii. 6.\r\n\r\n[1010] _Mote_ is the word used in Scotland, as in the north of England,\r\nPembrokeshire, and Ireland, for the Norman _motte_. As the word is\r\nstill a living word in Scotland, its original sense has been partly\r\nlost, and it seems to be now applied to some defensive works which are\r\nnot mottes at all. But the true motes of Scotland entirely resemble the\r\nmottes of France and England.\r\n\r\n[1011] _Scottish Review_, xxxii., 232.\r\n\r\n[1012] _Scottish Review_, xxxii., 232.\r\n\r\n[1013] _Ibid._, p. 236.\r\n\r\n[1014] This list is mainly compiled from Chalmers' _Caledonia_,\r\nvol. i., book iv., ch. i. The letter C. refers to Dr Christison's\r\n_Early Fortifications in Scotland_; N., to Mr Neilson's paper in the\r\n_Scottish Review_, 1898; O.M., to the 25-inch Ordnance Map; G., to the\r\n_Gazetteer of Scotland_. It is a matter of great regret to the writer\r\nthat she has been unable to do any personal visitation of the Scottish\r\ncastles, except in the cases of Roxburgh and Jedburgh. It is therefore\r\nimpossible to be absolutely certain that all the hillocks mentioned in\r\nthis list are true mottes, or whether all of them still exist.\r\n\r\n[1015] _Registrum Magni Sigilli_, quoted by Christison, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[1016] A plan is given by Mr Coles in \"the Motes, Forts, and Doons of\r\nKirkcudbright.\" Soc. _Ant.

The N. S. A. says: \"There is the\r\nsite of an ancient castle close to the town, on a mound of considerable\r\nheight, called the Castle Hill, which is surrounded by a deep moat.\"\r\n\"Dumfries,\" p. 383.\r\n\r\n[1019] _Annals_, ii., 196, cited in Douglas's _History of the Border\r\nCounties_, 173.\r\n\r\n[1020] Round, in _The Ancestor_, 10, 108.\r\n\r\n[1021] Dr Christison distinctly marks one on his map, but Mr Coles says\r\nthere is no trace of one, though the name Marl Mount is preserved.\r\n_Soc.

Is there such\r\na word for a meeting in Gaelic? If there is, it must be derived from\r\nAnglo-Saxon _mot_ or _gemot_. But there is no need to go to Gaelic\r\nfor this word, as it is clear from the _Registrum Magni Sigilli_ that\r\n_moit_ was a common version of _mote_, and meant a castle hill, the\r\n_mota_ or _mons castri_, as it is often called.\r\n\r\n[1025] Chalmers, _Caledonia_, iii., 864.

See Mr Neilson's papers in\r\nthe _Dumfries Standard_, June 28, 1899. Mr Neilson remarks: \"It may\r\nwell be that the original castle of Dumfries was one of Malcolm IV.'s\r\nforts, and that the mote of Troqueer, at the other side of a ford of\r\nthe river, was the first little strength of the series by which the\r\nNorman grip of the province was sought to be maintained.\"\r\n\r\n[1035] \"Mottes, Forts, and Doons of Kirkcudbright,\" _Soc. Ant. Scot._,\r\nxxv., 1890.\r\n\r\n[1036] The _Annals of the Four Masters_ mention the building of three\r\ncastles (caisteol) in Connaught in 1125, and the _Annals of Ulster_\r\nsay that Tirlagh O'Connor built a castle (caislen) at Athlone in 1129.\r\nWhat the nature of these castles was it is now impossible to say, but\r\nthere are no mottes at the three places mentioned in Connaught (Dunlo,\r\nGalway, and Coloony). The _caislen_ at Athlone was not recognised by\r\nthe Normans as a castle of their sort, as John built his castle on a\r\nnew site, on land obtained from the church. _Sweetman's Cal._, p. 80.\r\n\r\n[1037] The meagre entries in the various _Irish Annals_ may often\r\ncome from contemporary sources, but as none of their MSS. are older\r\nthan the 14th century, they do not stand on the same level as the two\r\nauthorities above mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1038] \"Hibernicus enim populus castella non curat; silvis namque pro\r\ncastris, paludibus utitur pro fossatis.\" _Top. Hib._, 182, R. S., vol.\r\nv. In the same passage he speaks of the \"fossa infinita, alta nimis,\r\nrotunda quoque, et pleraque triplicia; castella etiam murata, et adhuc\r\nintegra, vacua tarnen et deserta,\" which he ascribes to the Northmen.\r\nThis passage has been gravely adduced as an argument in favour of the\r\nprehistoric existence of mottes! as though a round _ditch_ necessarily\r\nimplied a round _hill_ within it! Giraldus was probably alluding to the\r\nround embankments or _raths_, of which such immense numbers are still\r\nto be found in Ireland. By the \"walled castles\" he probably meant the\r\nstone enclosures or _cashels_ which are also so numerous in Ireland.\r\nIn the time of Giraldus the word _castellum_, though it had become the\r\nproper word for a private castle, had not quite lost its original sense\r\nof a fortified enclosure of any kind, as we know from the phrases \"the\r\ncastle and tower\" or \"the castle and motte\" not infrequent in documents\r\nof the 12th century (see Round's _Geoffrey de Mandeville_, Appendix O,\r\np. 328). We may add that Giraldus' attribution of these prehistoric\r\nremains to Thorgils, the Norwegian, only shows that their origin was\r\nunknown in his day.\r\n\r\n[1039] See _Expug. Hib._, 383, 397, 398.\r\n\r\n[1040] I am informed that the \"Crith Gablach,\" which gives a minute\r\ndescription of one of these halls, is a very late document, and by no\r\nmeans to be trusted.\r\n\r\n[1041] _Vide_ the _Irish Annals_, passim.\r\n\r\n[1042] There is another story, preserved in _Hanmer's Chronicle_, that\r\nthe Irish chief Mac Mahon levelled two castles given to him by John de\r\nCourcy, saying he had promised to hold not stones but land.\r\n\r\n[1043] Joyce's _Irish Names of Places_, p. 290.\r\n\r\n[1044] See J. E. Lloyd, _Cymmrodor_, xi., 24; Skeat's _English\r\nDictionary_, \"town.\" In the \"Dindsenchas of Erin,\" edited by O'Beirne\r\nCrowe, _Journ. R. S. A. I._, 1872-1873, phrases occur, such as \"the\r\n_dun_ was open,\" \"she went back into the dun,\" which show clearly that\r\nthe _dun_ was an enclosure. In several passages _dun_ and _cathair_ are\r\ninterchanged.\r\n\r\n[1045] Joyce, _Irish Names of Places_, p. 273.\r\n\r\n[1046] _Annals of the Four Masters_, 1166.\r\n\r\n[1047] See Orpen, \"Motes and Norman Castles in Ireland,\" in _Journ.

I._, xxxvii., 143-147.\r\n\r\n[1048] Sweetman's _Calendar of Documents_ relating to Ireland, i., 412.\r\n\r\n[1049] That a motte-castle of earth and wood seemed to Giraldus quite\r\nan adequate castle is proved by the fact that numbers of the castles\r\nwhich he mentions have never had any stone defences. It may be a mere\r\ncoincidence, but it is worth noting, that there are no mottes now\r\nat any of the places which Giraldus mentions as _exilia municipia_,\r\nPembroke, Dundunnolf, Down City, and Carrick.\r\n\r\n[1050] This word must not be understood to mean that this new type\r\nof castle was Edward's invention, nor even that he was the first\r\nto introduce it into Europe from Palestine; it was used by the\r\nHohenstauffen emperors as early as 1224. See Köhler, _Entwickelung des\r\nKriegswesen_, iii., 475.\r\n\r\n[1051] Newcastle, Worcester, Gloucester, and Bristol are instances.\r\n\r\n[1052] Rhuddlan is an instance of this.\r\n\r\n[1053] _Book of Rights_, p. 203.\r\n\r\n[1054] It must be admitted that in the most recent and most learned\r\nedition of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ the topographical identifications\r\nare quite on a level with O'Donovan's.\r\n\r\n[1055] The _Annals_ have not been used, partly because in their present\r\nform they are not contemporary, and partly because the difficulties of\r\nidentifying many of the castles they mention appeared insuperable.\r\n\r\n[1056] See especially two papers on \"Motes and Norman Castles in\r\nIreland,\" in _English Historical Review_, vol. xxii., pp. 228, 240. Mr\r\nOrpen has further enriched this subject by a number of papers in the\r\n_Journ. R. S. A. I._, to which reference will be made subsequently.\r\n\r\n[1057] The only castles still unidentified are Aq'i, Kilmehal, Rokerel,\r\nand Inchleder.\r\n\r\n[1058] It should be stated that the great majority of the castles in\r\nthis list have been visited for the writer by Mr Basil T. Stallybrass,\r\nwho has a large acquaintance with English earthworks, as well as a\r\ncompetent knowledge of the history of architecture. The rest have\r\nbeen visited by the writer herself, except in a few cases where the\r\ninformation given in Lewis's _Topographical Dictionary_ or other\r\nsources was sufficient.

De Caumont says of the keep of Colchester, \"il me parait\r\nd'une antiquité moins certaine que celui de Guildford, et on pourrait\r\nle croire du douzième siècle\" (p. 205), a remark which considerably\r\nshakes one's confidence in his architectural judgment.\r\n\r\n[1122] As only the foundations of Pevensey are left, it gives little\r\nhelp in determining the character of early keeps. It had no basement\r\nentrance, and the forebuilding is evidently later than the keep.\r\n\r\n[1123] The Tower had once a forebuilding, which is clearly shown in\r\nHollar's etching of 1646, and other ancient drawings. Mr Harold Sands,\r\nwho has made a special study of the Tower, believes it to have been a\r\nlate 12th-century addition.\r\n\r\n[1124] Tiles are not used in the Tower, but some of the older arches of\r\nthe arcade on the top floor have voussoirs of rag, evidently continuing\r\nthe tradition of tiles. Most of the arches at Colchester are headed\r\nwith tiles.\r\n\r\n[1125] The room supposed to be the chapel in Bamborough keep has a\r\nround apse, but with no external projection, being formed in the\r\nthickness of the wall. The keep of Pevensey has three extraordinary\r\napse-like projections of solid masonry attached to its foundations. See\r\nMr Harold Sands' _Report of Excavations at Pevensey_.\r\n\r\n[1126] \"In the course of the 12th century, the base of the walls was\r\nthickened into a plinth, in order better to resist the battering ram.\"\r\n(_Manuel d'Archæologie Française_, ii., 463.) The keep of Pevensey has\r\na battering plinth which is clearly original, and which throws doubt\r\neither on this theory of the plinth, or on the age of the building.\r\n\r\n[1127] It is well known that blocks of huge size are employed in\r\nAnglo-Saxon architecture, but generally only as quoins or first\r\ncourses. See Baldwin Brown, _The Arts in Early England_, ii., 326.\r\n\r\n[1128] Baldwin Brown, \"Statistics of Saxon Churches,\" _Builder_, Sept.\r\n1900.\r\n\r\n[1129] Mr Round gives ground for thinking that this keep was built\r\nbetween 1080 and 1085. _Colchester Castle_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[1130] Piper's _Burgenkunde_, p. 85.\r\n\r\n[1131] Schulz, _Das Hofische Leben zur Zeit der Minnesinger_, i., 59.\r\nGrose writes of Bamborough Castle: \"The only fireplace in it was a\r\ngrate in the middle of a large room, where some stones in the middle\r\nof the floor are burned red.\" He gives no authority. _Antiquities of\r\nEngland and Wales_, iv., 57.\r\n\r\n[1132] \"The type of castle created in the 10th century persisted till\r\nthe Renascence.\" Enlart, _Manuel d'Archæologie_, ii., 516.\r\n\r\n[1133] See Appendix N.\r\n\r\n[1134] Enlart, _Manuel d'Archæologie_, ii., 516. \"Jusqu'au milieu du\r\nxii^ième siècle, et dans les exemples les plus simples des époques\r\nqui suivent, le donjon est bien près de constituer à lui seul tout le\r\nchâteau.\"\r\n\r\n[1135] _Abriss der Burgenkunde_, 50-60.\r\n\r\n[1136] _Entwickelung des Kriegswesen_, iii., 352 and 428. No\r\ncontinental writers are entirely to be trusted about English castles;\r\nthey generally get their information from Clark, and it is generally\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n[1137] This of course explains why the castle of London is always\r\ncalled _The Tower_; it was originally the only tower in the fortress.\r\n\r\n[1138] The _Close Rolls_ mention _palicia_ or stockades at the castles\r\nof Norwich, York, Devizes, Oxford, Sarum, Fotheringay, Hereford,\r\nMountsorel, and Dover.\r\n\r\n[1139] _Close Rolls_, i., 195a and 389.\r\n\r\n[1140] See Chapter VI., p. 89, and Appendix O.\r\n\r\n[1141] Piper states that the evidence of remains proves that the lower\r\nstorey was a prison. But these remains probably belong to a later date,\r\nwhen the donjon had been abandoned as a residence, and was becoming the\r\n_dungeon_ to which prisoners were committed. The top storey of the keep\r\nwas often used in early times as a prison for important offenders, such\r\nas Conan of Rouen, William, the brother of Duke Richard II., and Ranulf\r\nFlambard.\r\n\r\n[1142] See Appendix P.\r\n\r\n[1143] At Conisburgh and Orford castles there are ovens on the roofs,\r\nshowing that the cooking was carried on there; these are keeps of Henry\r\nII.'s time.\r\n\r\n[1144] De Caumont says these remains are on a motte, a strange\r\nstatement, as they are only a foot or two above the surrounding level.\r\n\r\n[1145] No stone castles in England are known to have been built by\r\nWilliam Rufus; he built Carlisle Castle, but probably only in wood. As\r\nwe have seen, several Welsh castles were built in his time, but all in\r\nearth and timber.\r\n\r\n[1146] Built by Archbishop William of Corbeuil. _Gervase of Canterbury_,\r\nR. S., ii., 382.\r\n\r\n[1147] Robert de Torigny, also called Robert de Monte, was Abbot of\r\nMont St Michael during the lifetime of Henry II., and was a favoured\r\ncourtier whose means of obtaining information were specially good.\r\nFrench writers are in the habit of discounting his statements, because\r\nthey do not recognise the almost universal precedence of a wooden\r\ncastle to the stone building, which when it is recognised, completely\r\nalters the perspective of castle dates. See Appendix Q.\r\n\r\n[1148] The keep of Caen, which was square, was demolished in 1793. De\r\nCaumont, _Cours d'Antiquités_, v., 231. The keep of Alençon is also\r\ndestroyed. There are fragments of castles at Argentan, Exmes, and\r\nSt Jean-le-Thomas. The keep of Vernon or Vernonnet is embedded in a\r\nfactory. _Guide Joanne_, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[1149] The writer has also visited Vire and Le Mans, but even if the\r\nwalls of the keep of Vire, of which only two sides remain, were the\r\nwork of Henry I., the details, such as the corbelled lintel, the window\r\nbenches, and the loop in the basement for a crossbow, point to a later\r\nperiod. At Le Mans, to the north of the cathedral, is a fragment of\r\nan ancient tower, built of the rudest rubble, with small quoins of\r\nashlar; this may be the keep built by William I., which Wace says was\r\nof stone and lime (p. 234, Andresen's edition). It is difficult to\r\nexamine, being built up with cottages. Domfront, like Langeais, is only\r\na fragment, consisting of two walls and some foundations.\r\n\r\n[1150] _Dictionnaire de l'Architecture._\r\n\r\n[1151] _M. M. A._, i., 186.\r\n\r\n[1152] In speaking of Falaise, of course we only mean the great square\r\nkeep, and not the Little Donjon attached to it at a later period, nor\r\nthe fine round keep added by Talbot in the 15th century.\r\n\r\n[1153] Small spaces, such as the chapel, passages, and mural chambers,\r\nare vaulted in most keeps.\r\n\r\n[1154] Colchester keep has only two storeys now, but Mr Round argues\r\nthat it must have had three, as a stairway leads upward from the second\r\nfloor, in the N.W. tower, and some fragments of window cases remain as\r\nevidence. _Colchester Castle_, p. 92.\r\n\r\n[1155] The Tower and Colchester keep both have wells, which are seldom\r\nwanting in any keep. There was no appearance of a well at Langeais, but\r\nexcavation might possibly reveal one.\r\n\r\n[1156] The first castle at Corfe was built by William's half-brother,\r\nRobert, Count of Mortain. The keep of Corfe is sometimes attributed\r\nto him, but when we compare its masonry with that of the early hall\r\nor chapel in the middle bailey, we shall see that this date is most\r\nunlikely. Norwich was always a royal castle.\r\n\r\n[1157] Part of the basement of Norwich keep has pillars, from which it\r\nhas been assumed that it was vaulted; but no trace of vaulting is to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n[1158] The only decoration at Corfe keep is in the oratory, which being\r\nat a vast height in one of the ruined walls is inaccessible to the\r\nordinary visitor. Corfe was so much pulled about by Sir Christopher\r\nHatton in Elizabeth's reign, and is now so ruinous, that many features\r\nare obscure. Norwich has suffered greatly from restorations, and from\r\nre-casing.\r\n\r\n[1159] In 1184 Henry II. paid \"for re-roofing the tower of Gisors.\"\r\n_Rotuli Scacc. Normanniæ_, i., 72.\r\n\r\n[1160] It should be remembered that rude work is not invariably a sign\r\nof age; it may only show haste, or poverty of resources. It should also\r\nbe mentioned that in the _Exchequer Rolls of Normandy_ there is an\r\nentry of £650 in 1184 for several works at Gisors, including \"the wall\r\nround the motte\" (murum circa motam). Possibly this may refer to a wall\r\nround the foot of the motte, which seems still to exist. The shell wall\r\nof Gisors should be compared with that of Lincoln, which is probably of\r\nthe first half of the 12th century.\r\n\r\n[1161] No decagonal tower of Henry I.'s work is known to exist; all his\r\ntower keeps are square.\r\n\r\n[1162] Bower, _Scotichronicon_, v., 42. This passage was first pointed\r\nout by Mr George Neilson in _Notes and Queries_, 8th ser., viii., 321.\r\nThe keep of Carlisle has been so much pulled about as to obscure most\r\nof its features. The present entrance to the basement is not original.\r\n\r\n[1163] _M. M. A._, i., 353.\r\n\r\n[1164] Unfortunately the greater part of these valuable _Rolls_ is\r\nstill unpublished. The Pipe Roll Society is issuing a volume every\r\nyear, and this year (1910) has reached the 28th Henry II.\r\n\r\n[1165] The keeps of Richmond and Bowes were only finished by Henry II.;\r\nRichmond was begun by Earl Conan, who died in 1170, when Henry appears\r\nto have taken up the work. Bowes was another of Earl Conan's castles.\r\nTickhill is now destroyed to the foundations, but it is clear that it\r\nwas a tower. The writer has examined all the keeps mentioned in this\r\nlist. It will be noticed that most of the towers took many years to\r\nbuild.\r\n\r\n[1166] Henry built one shell keep of rubble and rag, that of Berkeley\r\nCastle, which is not mentioned in the _Pipe Rolls_, having been built\r\nbefore his accession. It is noteworthy that he did not build it for\r\nhimself, but for his ally, Robert Fitz Hardinge.\r\n\r\n[1167] The basement storey of Chester keep (the only part which now\r\nremains) is also vaulted, but this can scarcely be Henry's work, for\r\nthough he spent £102 on this castle in 1159, it must have been begun by\r\nRanulf, Earl of Chester, in Stephen's reign. Moreover, it is doubtful\r\nwhether the vaulting, which is covered by whitewash, is really ancient.\r\n\r\n[1168] Leland says of Wark, \"the dongeon is made of foure howses\r\nhight,\" but probably he included the basement.\r\n\r\n[1169] The earliest instance of a portcullis groove with which the\r\nwriter is acquainted is in the basement entrance of Colchester. It is\r\nobvious to anyone who carefully examines this entrance and the great\r\nstair to the left of it that they are additions of a later time than\r\nWilliam's work. The details seem to point to Henry I.'s reign. The keep\r\nof Rochester has also a portcullis groove which seems to be a later\r\naddition.\r\n\r\n[1170] King, paper on Canterbury Castle in _Archæologia_, vi., 298. We\r\nhave not observed in any English keeps (except in this single instance)\r\nany of the elaborate plans to entrap the enemy which M. Viollet le Duc\r\ndescribes in his article on Donjons. He was an imaginative writer, and\r\nmany of his statements should not be accepted without reserve.\r\n\r\n[1171] Wark was also an octagonal keep, but there is considerable\r\ndoubt whether this octagonal building was the work of Henry II., as\r\nLord Dacre wrote to Wolsey in 1519 concerning Wark that \"the dongeon\r\nis clerely finished,\" and mentions that all the storeys but one were\r\nvaulted with stone. This makes it almost certain that the castle of\r\nWark was entirely rebuilt at this time, after having been demolished by\r\nthe Scots in 1460. It is now an utter ruin, and even the foundations of\r\nthe keep are buried.\r\n\r\n[1172] At Thorne, near Doncaster, where the great earls Warenne had a\r\ncastle, there are the foundations, on a motte, of a keep which seems to\r\nresemble that of Orford; it ought to be thoroughly excavated.\r\n\r\n[1173] These measurements are from Grose, _Antiquities_, v., 74.\r\n\r\n[1174] See Payne Gallwey, _The Crossbow_, 309; Köhler, _Kriegswesen_,\r\niii., 192. The trébuchet is first mentioned at the siege of Piacenza in\r\n1199.\r\n\r\n[1175] As far as we can tell, the tops of keeps having generally been\r\nruined or altered, the common arrangement was either a simple gable,\r\nor two gables resting on a cross wall, such as all the larger keeps\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\n[1176] Another consequence of the introduction of an engine of longer\r\nrange was the widening of castle ditches. We frequently find works on\r\nditches mentioned in John's accounts.\r\n\r\n[1177] Payne Gallwey, _The Crossbow_, p. 3. We find it used by\r\nLouis VI. of France, before 1137. Suger's _Gesta Ludovici_, 10 (ed.\r\nMolinier). Ten balistarii are mentioned in Domesday Book, but they may\r\nhave been engineers of the great balista, a siege machine. There is no\r\nrepresentation of a crossbow in the Bayeux Tapestry. There are entries\r\nin the _Pipe Rolls_ of 6, 8, and 9 Henry II. of payments for arbelast,\r\nbut these also may refer to the great balista.\r\n\r\n[1178] _Guill. Brit. Armorici Philippides_, Bouquet xvii., line 315.\r\n\r\n[1179] The bow brought by Richard from Palestine is believed to have\r\nbeen an improved form of crossbow, made of horn and yew, \"light,\r\nelastic, and far more powerful than a bow of solid wood.\" Payne\r\nGallwey, _The Crossbow_.\r\n\r\n[1180] \"Fenestris arcubalistaribus,\" Bouquet xvii., 75. The writer has\r\nnever found a single defensive loophole in any of the keeps of Henry I.\r\nor Henry II. Köhler remarks that the loopholes up to this period do not\r\nseem to be intended for shooting (_Entwickelung des Kriegswesen_, iii.,\r\n409), and Clark has some similar observations.\r\n\r\n[1181] _Dictionnaire de l'Architecture_, art. \"Meurtrière.\"\r\n\r\n[1182] Meyrick in his _Ancient Armour_ quotes a charter of 1239,\r\nin which the French king grants a castle to the Count de Montfort\r\non condition \"quod non possumus habere in eodem archeriam nec\r\narbalisteriam,\" which Meyrick audaciously translates \"any perpendicular\r\nloophole for archers, nor any cruciform loophole for crossbowmen.\" The\r\nquotation is unfortunately given by Sir R. Payne Gallwey without the\r\nLatin original. It is at any rate probable that the cruciform loophole\r\nwas for _archers_; it does not appear till the time of the long-bow,\r\nwhich was improved and developed by Edward I., who made it the most\r\nformidable weapon of English warfare.\r\n\r\n[1183] See Appendix H.\r\n\r\n[1184] _Entwickelung des Kriegswesen_, iii., 417.\r\n\r\n[1185] In 1186, the Duke of Burgundy caused the towers and walls of\r\nhis castle of Chatillon to be \"hoarded\" (hordiari). This duke had been\r\na companion of Richard's on the third crusade. William le Breton,\r\n_Philippides_, line 600. Richard's _hurdicia_ at Chateau Gaillard were\r\ntwo years earlier.\r\n\r\n[1186] See Dieulafoy, _Le Chateau Gaillard et l'Architecture Militaire\r\nau Treizième Siècle_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[1187] The best French and German authorities are agreed about this.\r\nThe holes in which the wooden beams supporting the hurdicia were placed\r\nmay still be seen in many English castles, and so may the remains of\r\nthe stone brackets. They would be good indications of date, were it not\r\nthat hurdicia could so easily be added to a much older building.\r\n\r\n[1188] Köhler gives the reign of Frederic Barbarossa (1155-1191) as the\r\ntime of the first appearance of the round keep in Germany.\r\n\r\n[1189] In spite of this, I cannot feel satisfied that the keep of\r\nÉtampes is of so early a date. The decorative features appear early,\r\nbut the second and third storeys are both vaulted, which is a late\r\nsign. The keep called Clifford's Tower at York, built by Henry III.\r\n1245 to 1259, is on the same plan as Étampes.\r\n\r\n[1190] This keep has been long destroyed.\r\n\r\n[1191] Ground entrances occur in several much earlier keeps, as\r\nat Colchester (almost certainly an addition of Henry I.'s time),\r\nBamborough (probably Henry II.'s reign), and Richmond, where Earl Conan\r\nseems to have used a former entrance gateway to make the basement\r\nentrance of his keep. See Milward, _Arch. Journ._, vol. v.\r\n\r\n[1192] Built by Earl Hamelin, half-brother of Henry II., who died in\r\n1201.\r\n\r\n[1193] Viollet le Duc, art. \"Donjon.\"\r\n\r\n[1194] The walls of the Tower are from 12 to 15 feet thick at the base;\r\nthose of Norwich 13; the four walls of Dover respectively, 17, 18,\r\n19, and 21 feet; Carlisle, 15 feet on two sides. (Clark.) William of\r\nWorcester tells us that Bristol keep was 25 feet thick at the base!\r\n_Itin._, p. 260.\r\n\r\n[1195] See Enlart, _Manuel d'Archæologie Française_, ii., 526.\r\n\r\n[1196] MacGibbon and Ross, _Castellated Architecture of Scotland_, p.\r\n159.\r\n\r\n[1197] This type of castle was probably borrowed from the fortifications\r\nof Greek cities, which the Crusaders had observed in the East.\r\n\r\n[1198] Conway and Carnarvon consist of two adjoining courts, without\r\nany external enclosure but a moat. Flint has a great tower outside\r\nthe quadrangle, which is sometimes mistakenly called a keep, but its\r\ninternal arrangements show that it was not so, and it is doubtful\r\nwhether it was ever roofed over. It was simply a tower to protect the\r\nentrance, taking the place of the 13th-century barbican.\r\n\r\n[1199] Köhler states that the gatehouse palace is peculiar to England:\r\n\"only at Perpignan is there anything like it.\" _Entwickelung des\r\nKriegswesen_, iii., 480.\r\n\r\n[1200] Köhler mentions the castle of Neu Leiningen as the first example\r\nin Germany, built in 1224. _Kriegswesen_, iii., 475. Frederic II.'s\r\ncastles were of this type. The castle of Boulogne, finished in 1231,\r\nis one of the oldest examples of the keepless type in France. Enlart,\r\n_Archæologie Française_, ii., 534. The Bastille of Paris was a castle\r\nof this kind. According to Hartshorne, Barnwell Castle, in Northants,\r\nis of the keepless kind, and as the _Hundred Rolls_ state that it was\r\nbuilt in 1264, we seem to have here a positive instance of a keepless\r\ncastle in Henry III.'s reign. _Arch. Inst. Newcastle_, vol. 1852. And\r\nit appears to be certain that Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester,\r\nbuilt the keepless castle of Caerphilly before Edward came to the\r\nthrone. See Little's _Mediæval Wales_, p. 87.\r\n\r\n[1201] French archæologists are enthusiastic over the keep of Chateau\r\nGaillard, the scientific construction of the towers of the curtain, the\r\navoidance of \"dead angles,\" the continuous flanking, etc. See Viollet\r\nle Duc, art. \"Chateau,\" and Dieulafoy, _Le Chateau Gaillard_.\r\n\r\n[1202] This type is extremely rare: Trim, in Ireland, and Castle\r\nRushen, in the Isle of Man, are the only other instances known to the\r\nwriter. Trim is a square tower with square turrets in the middle of\r\neach face; Castle Rushen is on the same plan, but the central part\r\nappears to have been an open court.\r\n\r\n[1203] Enlart, _Archæologie Française_, ii., 516.\r\n\r\n[1204] Martène's _Thesaurus Anecdotorum_, iv., 118. \"Nulli licuit in\r\nNormannia fossatum facere in planam terram, nisi tale quod de fundo\r\npotuisset terram jactare superius sine scabello. Et ibi nulli licuit\r\nfacere palicium, nisi in una regula; et id sine propugnaculis et\r\nalatoriis. Et in rupe et in insula nulli licuit facere fortitudinem, et\r\nnulli licuit in Normannia castellum facere.\"\r\n\r\n[1205] The document which calls itself _Leges Henrici Primi_, x., 1,\r\ndeclares the \"castellatio trium scannorum\" to be a right of the king.\r\n_Scannorum_ is clearly _scamnorum_, banks. It is noteworthy that a\r\nmotte-and-bailey castle is actually a fortification with three banks:\r\none round the top of the motte, one round the edge of the bailey, one\r\non the counterscarp of the ditch.\r\n\r\n[1206] See the case of Benhall, _Close Rolls_, ii., 52b (1225).\r\n\r\n[1207] Aldreth and Burton are omitted from this list.\r\n\r\n[1208] M. and B. stand for Motte and Bailey; K. and B. for Keep and\r\nBailey; O. for Outside the Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Transcriber's Note:\r\n\r\n    Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as\r\n    possible.
