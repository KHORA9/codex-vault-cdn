CONSTABLE, Printers to His Majesty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the first criticism on this book will be that it is colloquial.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that though Mr. Hussey has for two\r\ngenerations been one of the most noted raconteurs in Ireland, he has\r\nnever been addicted to writing, and for that reason has always declined\r\nto arrange his memoirs, though several times approached by publishers\r\nand strongly urged to do so by his friends, notably Mr. Froude and Mr.\r\nJohn Bright. If his reminiscences are to be at all characteristic they\r\nmust be conversational, and it is as a talker that he himself at length\r\nconsents to appear in print.\r\n\r\nIn this volume he endeavours to supply some view of his own country as\r\nit has impressed itself on 'the most abused man in Ireland,' as Lord\r\nJames of Hereford characterised Mr. Hussey. How little practical effect\r\nseveral attacks on his life and scores of threatening letters have had\r\non him is shown by the fact that he survives at the age of eighty to\r\nexpress the wish that his recollections may open the eyes of many as\r\nwell as prove diverting.\r\n\r\nPossessing a retentive memory, he has been further able to assist me\r\nwith seven large volumes of newspaper cuttings which he had collected\r\nsince 1853, while the publishers kindly permit the use of two articles\r\nhe contributed to _Murray's Magazine_ in May and July 1887. To me the\r\npreparation of this book has been a delightful task, materially helped\r\nby Mr. Hussey's family as well as by a few others on either side of the\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nHOME GORDON.\r\n\r\n13 OVINGTON SQUARE, S.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n         PREFACE                                       v\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAP.\r\n      I.

Just as\r\nevery Scotsman is not canny and every American is not cute, so every\r\nIrishman is not what the Saxon believes him to be. But there can be\r\nlittle doubt what type of men these ancient Irish sovereigns were, and I\r\nregretfully confess I cannot trace my descent from them.\r\n\r\nThe family of Hussey was of English extraction, according to that rather\r\nvaluable book _The Antient and Present State of the County of Kerry_, by\r\nCharles Smith, 1756--the companion volumes dealing with Cork and\r\nWaterford are much less precious. Personally I always understood that\r\nthe Husseys hailed from Normandy, as will be seen a few pages on, but\r\ntradition on such a point is not of much value.\r\n\r\nAnyway the family of Hussey settled in very early times at Dingle, and\r\nalso had several lands and castles in the barony of Corkaquiny.\r\n\r\nDingle was the only town in this barony, and it was incorporated by\r\nQueen Elizabeth in 1585, when she granted it the same privileges which\r\nwere enjoyed by Drogheda, with a superiority over the harbours of Ventry\r\nand Smerwick. The Virgin Sovereign also presented the town with £300 for\r\nthe purpose of making a wall round it.\r\n\r\nThe Irish formerly called Dingle Daingean in Cushy, or the fastness of\r\nthe Husseys. One of the FitzGeralds, Earl of Desmond, had granted to an\r\nancestor of my own a considerable tract of land in these parts, namely,\r\nfrom Castle-Drum to Dingle, or as others say, he gave him as much as he\r\ncould walk over in his jackboots in one day. That Hussey built a castle,\r\nsaid to be the first erected at Dingle, the vaults of which were\r\nafterwards used as the county gaol.\r\n\r\nThere is mention of this in the grant of a charter to Dingle by King\r\nJames I. in the fourth year of his reign: 'The house of John Hussey\r\ngranted for a gaol and common hall to the corporation.'\r\n\r\nA grim interest lurks in the fact that the dedication of Smith's\r\n_History_ to Lord Newport, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, recites that\r\n'this Kingdom, my lord, is a kind of Terra Incognita to the greater part\r\nof Europe.'\r\n\r\nIs it not so to this day?\r\n\r\nDo I not meet scores of people who tell me they would love to go to\r\nKerry, but they have never been nearer than Killarney.\r\n\r\nThat is the sort of speech which makes me wonder how geography is\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\nIt is on a par with the remark of a prominent Arctic explorer, that he\r\nhad never been to Killarney because it was so far off.\r\n\r\nPeople, however, who go there apparently like it.\r\n\r\nThe chief Elizabethan settlers in Kerry were William and Charles\r\nHerbert, Valentine Brown, ancestor of the Kenmares, Edmund Denny, and\r\nCaptain Conway, whose daughter Avis married Robert Blennerhasset, while\r\na little later, in 1600, John Crosbie was made Bishop of Ardfert and\r\nAghadoe.\r\n\r\nTo-day the descendants of those settlers are still among the principal\r\nfolk in Kerry, though that is more due to their own selves than to the\r\nsupport they had from any British Government.\r\n\r\nThis Valentine Brown, who was a worshipful and valiant knight, wrote a\r\ndiscourse for settling Munster in 1584. His plan was to exterminate the\r\nFitzGeralds and to protestantise Ireland; but by the irony of fate his\r\nown son married a daughter of the Earl of Desmond and became a Roman\r\nCatholic.\r\n\r\nIn the Carew Manuscript it is recorded that he estimated that one\r\nconstable and six men would suffice for Cork, but for Ventry, 'a large\r\nharbour near Dingle,' one constable and fifty men were necessary; so he\r\nevidently had a clear apprehension of the villainous capabilities of the\r\nmen of Kerry.\r\n\r\nIt is also recorded that in the parish of Killiney is a stronghold\r\ncalled Castle Gregory, which before the wars of 1641 was possessed by\r\nWalter Hussey, who was proprietor of the Magheries and Ballybeggan.\r\nHaving a considerable party under his command, he made a garrison of his\r\ncastle, whence having been long pressed by Cromwell's forces, he escaped\r\nin the night with all his men, and got into Minard Castle, in which he\r\nwas closely beset by Colonels Lehunt and Sadler. After some time had\r\nbeen spent, the English observing that the besieged were making use of\r\npewter bullets, powder was laid under the vaults of the castle, and both\r\nWalter Hussey and his men were blown up.\r\n\r\nPrior to this, 'on January 31, 1641, Walter Hussey, with Florence\r\nMacCarthy and others, attacked Ballybeggan Castle, plundered and burnt\r\nthe house of Mr. Henry Huddleston, and did the same to the house and\r\nhaggards of Mr. Hore, where they built an engine called a saw, having\r\nits three sides made musket-proof with boards. It was drawn on four\r\nwheels, each a foot high, with folding doors to open inwards and several\r\nloopholes to shoot through, without a floor, so that ten or twelve men\r\nwho went therein might drive it forwards. These machines were set\r\nagainst castle walls whilst the men within them attempted to make a\r\nbreach with crows and pickaxes.'\r\n\r\nInfernal machines are, after all, not confined to our own times, and\r\nthis same rascally ancestor of my own appears to have had predatory\r\nhabits more likely to be appreciated by his followers than by his foes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDingle is now a somewhat dilapidated town, but that was not always the\r\ncase, for it is mentioned in my dear old friend Froude's _History of\r\nEngland_ that the then Earl of Desmond called on the ambassador of\r\nCharles V. at his lodgings in Dingle. The old records of the place would\r\nbe worth diligent antiquarian research, a matter even more difficult in\r\nIreland than elsewhere. Should all be brought to light, I fancy the part\r\nplayed by my family would not grow smaller.\r\n\r\nThe Husseys spread away over the county, after having their lands\r\nforfeited under both Elizabeth and Cromwell, which was the most\r\nrespectable thing to suffer in those times. In the reign of Queen Anne,\r\nColonel Maurice Hussey sold Cahirnane to the Herberts, and there is a\r\ngarden still called Hussey's Garden in the property. He built a mortuary\r\nchapel for himself on the top of a small hill just outside the gates of\r\nMuckross, where his own grave near that beautiful abbey can be seen to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nThis Colonel Maurice Hussey resided for some time in England, and\r\nappears to have married an English lady; and it is odd that though a\r\nRoman Catholic he was trusted by the Governments of both William and\r\nAnne. There seems to have been something versatile about his rather\r\nmysterious career, the key to which may be found in the surmise that\r\nuntil the accession of King George he was a Jacobite at heart; which\r\nthrows some doubt on his assertion in a letter that there are very few\r\nTories--or outlaws--in Kerry, where the Whig rule was never enforced\r\nwith great severity. He was, however, committed to 'Trally jail' (_i.e._\r\nTralee) on the fear of a landing by the Pretender, whence he wrote\r\npleading letters, in one of which he mentions that his son-in-law,\r\nMacCartie, has taken the oaths of abjuration; and later, when released,\r\nhe seems to have been disturbed at the large number of German\r\nProtestants, driven out of the Palatinate by Louis the Fourteenth, who\r\nsettled at Bally M'Elligott.\r\n\r\nAny one who rambles about Dingle and investigates the older buildings,\r\nso carefully examined by Mr. Hitchcock, will notice how frequent is the\r\nemblem of a tree; and that is a conspicuous feature of the Hussey\r\narmorial bearings.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the allusions made in Smith's book to my ancestors, it\r\nmay be pointed out that he repeated the popular tradition at the very\r\ntime when the Husseys, like the rest of their fellow Catholics all over\r\nthe country, were disinherited and depressed, and when he could gain\r\nnothing by doing them honour.\r\n\r\nAs for my name, it seems to have really been Norman, and to have been De\r\nLa Huse, De La Hoese, and later Husee, Huse, and, finally, Hussey.\r\n\r\nBurke in his extinct _Peerage_ states that Sir Hugh Husse came to\r\nIreland, 17 Hen. II., and married the sister of Theobald FitzWalter,\r\nfirst Butler of Ireland, and that he died seized of large possessions in\r\nMeath. His son married the daughter of Hugh de Lacy, senior Earl of\r\nUlster, and their great-grandson, Sir John Hussey, Knight, first Earl of\r\nGaltrim, was summoned to Parliament in 1374.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the State Papers in the Public Record Office, quoted in the\r\n_Journal of the Royal Society of Irish Antiquaries_ for September 1893,\r\np. 266, prove beyond question that Nicholas de Huse or Hussy and his\r\nfather, Herbert de Huse, were land-owners of some importance in Kerry in\r\n1307. Stirring times they must have been, of which we have no fiction\r\nunder the guise of history, though then men had to fight hard to\r\npreserve their lives and maintain their dignity. We can imagine the\r\ntussle, even in these degenerate days when no challenge follows the\r\nexchange of insults, even in the House of Commons, and when the\r\nperpetration of the most cowardly outrage in Ireland has to be induced\r\nby preliminary potations of whisky. Of course, those old times were bad\r\ntimes, but the badness was at least above board and the warfare pretty\r\nstoutly waged. There is some sense in fighting your foe hand to hand,\r\nbut to-day when a battle is contested by armies which never see one\r\nanother, and are decimated by silent bullets, the courage needed is of a\r\ndifferent character, and the wicked murder of such combats is obvious.\r\n\r\nBut let us quit war and confiscation for the equally stormy region known\r\nas politics, wherein it may be noted that in 1613 Michael Hussey was\r\nMember of Parliament for Dingle.\r\n\r\nNow for a coincidence in Christian names.\r\n\r\nOnly two Husseys forfeited in the Desmond Rebellion, and they were John\r\nand Maurice.\r\n\r\nIn the Irish Parliament of James II., when Kerry returned eight members,\r\ntwo of them were Husseys, and their names were John and Maurice.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather's name was John, and his father before him was Maurice,\r\nand I christened my two surviving sons John and Maurice.\r\n\r\nWe do not go in for much variety of nomenclature in our family.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, John Hussey, lived at Dingle, his mother being a member\r\nof the well-known Galway family of Bodkin. He was an offshoot of the\r\nWalter Hussey who had been converted into an animated projectile by the\r\nunderground machinations of Cromwell's colonels. He was a very little\r\nman, who had a landed property at Dingle, did nothing in particular, and\r\nreceived the usual pompous eulogy on his tombstone. I never heard that\r\nhe left any papers or diaries, and I do not think that he ever went out\r\nof Kerry--he had too much sense.\r\n\r\nA rather diverting story in which his sister was the heroine may be\r\nworth telling, if only because it was so characteristic of the period.\r\n\r\nIn those days, as now, Husseys and Dennys were closely associated, and\r\nboth my great-aunt and Miss Denny, known locally as the 'Princess\r\nRoyal,' were going to a ball. At that time it was the fashion for the\r\ngirls of the period to wear muslin skirts edged with black velvet. The\r\nmuslin was easily procured; not so the velvet, which was eventually\r\nobtained by sacrificing an ancient pair of nether garments belonging to\r\nmy great-grandfather.\r\n\r\nAfter the early dinner then fashionable, each of the damsels was\r\ndeparting for the Castle, with a swain at the door of her sedan-chair,\r\nwhen our kinswoman, Lady Donoughmore, who was on the door-step watching\r\nthem off, enthusiastically shouted:--\r\n\r\n'Success to the breeches! Success to the breeches!'\r\n\r\nImagine the horrified confusion of the poor 'Princess Royal,' not then\r\neighteen.\r\n\r\nThis episode reminds me of the modern Scottish story of a tiresome small\r\nboy who wanted more cake at a tea-party, and threatened his parents with\r\ndire revelations if they did not comply with his demands. As they showed\r\nno signs of intimidation, he banged on the table to obtain attention,\r\nand then announced:--\r\n\r\n'Ma new breeks are made out of the winter curtains.'\r\n\r\nAn incident connected with one of the earliest private carriages in\r\nKerry is worth telling. The vehicle in question had just been purchased\r\nby a certain Miss Mullins, daughter of a former Lord Ventry, who\r\nregarded it on its arrival with almost sacred awe. A dance in the\r\nneighbourhood seemed an appropriate opportunity for impressing the\r\ncounty with her newly acquired grandeur, but the night proving wet, she\r\ninsisted on reverting to a former mode of progression, and rode pillion\r\nbehind her coachman.\r\n\r\nThe result was that she caught a violent chill, which turned to\r\npneumonia, and as her relatives were assembled round her deathbed, the\r\nold lady exclaimed, between her last gasps for breath:--\r\n\r\n'Thank God I never took out the carriage that wet night.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPARENTAGE AND EARLY YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father, Peter Bodkin Hussey, was for a long time a barrister at the\r\nIrish Bar, practising in the Four Courts, where more untruths are spoken\r\nthan anywhere else in the three kingdoms, except in the House of Commons\r\nduring an Irish debate. All law in Ireland is a grave temptation to\r\nlying, and the greatest number of Courts produced a stupendous amount of\r\nmendacity--or it was so in earlier times, at all events.\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear the tale of the old woman who came to Daniel\r\nO'Connell, outside the Four Courts, as he was walking down the steps,\r\nand said to him:--\r\n\r\n'Would your honour be so kind as to tell me the name of an honest\r\nattorney?'\r\n\r\nThe Liberator stopped, scratched his head in a perplexed way, and\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n'Well now, ma'am, you bate me intoirely.'\r\n\r\nMy father had red hair, and was very impetuous. Therefore he was\r\nchristened 'Red Precipitate' by Jerry Kellegher.\r\n\r\nThis legal luminary was a noted wit even at the Irish Bar of that time,\r\na confraternity where humour was almost as rampant as\r\ncreditors--irresponsible fun, and a light purse are generally allied;\r\nyour wealthy fellow has too much care for his gold to have spirits to be\r\nmirthful.\r\n\r\nThe tales about him are endless. Here are just a few I have heard from\r\nmy father's lips.\r\n\r\nJerry had a cousin, a wine merchant, who supplied the Bar mess, and a\r\ncomplaint was lodged that the bottles were very small.\r\n\r\nTo which Jerry retorted:--\r\n\r\n'You idiot, don't you know they shrink in the washing,' which satisfied\r\nthe grumbler. And that always seemed to me the strangest part of the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nIn those days religious feeling ran pretty high--I will not go so far as\r\nto say it has entirely died down to-day--and the usual Protestant toast\r\nwas:--\r\n\r\n'The Pope, the Devil, and the Pretender.'\r\n\r\nNow, Jerry was a Roman Catholic, none the less earnest because he had a\r\nmerry way with him. On a certain Friday he was seen to be fasting by a\r\nvery foppish barrister, who thought a great deal of himself.\r\n\r\nHe remarked to Jerry, with unnecessary impertinence:--\r\n\r\n'Sir, it appears you have some of the Pope in your stomach.'\r\n\r\nTo which Jerry, quick as a pistol-shot, retorted:--\r\n\r\n'And you have the whole of the Pretender in your head,' after which\r\nthere was the devil to pay.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain Chancellor in Ireland who was born a few years after\r\nhis father and mother had separated. As he did not like Jerry, he used\r\nto make a great fuss about how he should pronounce his name. At last in\r\nCourt one day he burst out:--\r\n\r\n'Pray tell me what you wish me to call you--Mr. Kellegher, or Mr.\r\nKellaire?'\r\n\r\n'Call me anything you like, my lud, so long as you call me born in\r\nwedlock.'\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor did not score that time.\r\n\r\nAt one time there were grave complaints made about the light-hearted way\r\nin which Jerry handled his cases, and his practice fell off. He was\r\nconversing with a very stupid judge, lately elevated to the Bench, and\r\nobserved:--\r\n\r\n'It's a very extraordinary world: you have risen by your gravity, and I\r\nhave fallen by my levity.'\r\n\r\nHe had a son who, in my time, had a large practice at the Bar, but I\r\nnever came across him, nor did I ever hear that there was anything\r\nremarkable about him, except that he was not so witty as his father,\r\nwhich was not wonderful.\r\n\r\nAfter all, as Jerry was before my own experience, I must not delay over\r\nhim, so I will only give one more tale about him, and pass on.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Avonmore got his peerage for voting for the Union, he had his\r\npatent of nobility read out at a dinner-party, and it commenced,\r\n'George, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.'\r\n\r\n'Stop,' cried Jerry, 'I object to that. The consideration is set out too\r\nearly in the deed.'\r\n\r\nThis long digression over, I revert to my father about whose respectable\r\npractice at the Four Courts I know nothing except that he allowed others\r\nto become judges, and did not find solicitors putting his services up to\r\nauction.\r\n\r\nBy the death of his elder brother, he succeeded to a property, near\r\nDingle, on which he went to live and then got married, which was the\r\nwisest thing that he could do.\r\n\r\nMy mother was Mary Hickson, and her descent was this wise.\r\n\r\nThe Murrays were said to have come to Scotland from Moravia in the first\r\ncentury; and a pretty bulky history of the clan reveals as much truth\r\nabout them as the author cared to put in when tired of inventing less\r\nprobable facts. Sir Walter Murray, Lord of Drumshegrat, came to Ireland\r\nwith Edward de Bruce and was killed in battle, leaving three sons, one\r\nof whom, christened Andrew, settled in County Down. Some of his\r\ndescendants migrated to Bantry, where, in 1670, William Murray married\r\nAnn Hornswell, and was succeeded by his third son George, who was in\r\nturn succeeded by his eldest son William, who married Anne Grainger. Of\r\nthe marriage, there was only one daughter Judith, who married Robert\r\nHickson, heir to the property.\r\n\r\nThey had five sons and two daughters, the younger of whom married Sir\r\nWilliam Cox, and the elder my father.\r\n\r\nThe superior of my dear mother never drew the breath of life. She lived\r\nuntil I was twenty-five, and I never met any man who could say more than\r\nI could for my mother, though equalled by what my own sons could say of\r\ntheirs, and she too came of the same stock, for I married my first\r\ncousin, Julia Agnes Hickson. It is said no man is thoroughly happy until\r\nhe is suitably married, an opinion I absolutely endorse; but happiness\r\nso great as my married life is not of public interest, and if it were, I\r\nshould not wear my heart on my sleeve for general inspection. Any\r\ntribute from me to my dear wife would be superfluous; the devoted love\r\nof our children has been the endorsement by the next generation of the\r\nfeelings which I have always felt towards her.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of my mother's eldest brother, John Hickson, called\r\nthe Sovereign of Dingle. He had powers to collect customs, to hold a\r\ncourt, and to try cases in much the same way that a lord provost had.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when a case was to be tried, two attorneys appeared from\r\nthe town of Tralee, about thirty miles off. Now John Hickson had his own\r\nideas about the attorneys of those days--ideas such as all honest men\r\nhad, but dared not express. So he sent a crier through the town to say\r\nthat the court was adjourned for a fortnight. When the appointed day\r\narrived, the attorneys arrived also, so again the melodious tones of the\r\ncrier proclaimed through the town that the court was adjourned for yet\r\nanother fortnight, Captain Hickson remarking to his wife that he was not\r\ngoing to be helped to administer justice by those who earned their\r\nliving on injustice. The attorneys gave it up in despair, leaving\r\nCaptain Hickson to lay down the law as he liked, and to do him justice,\r\nhis ideas were more conducive to peace and order than the arguments of\r\nIrish attorneys generally are.\r\n\r\nHe was loved and revered by the people, so that when the cholera raged\r\nin 1833 and 1834, and the constabulary were ordered to go into the\r\nhouses to remove the corpses (this to prevent the people 'waking' the\r\ndead, and so spreading the contagion), they dared not enter the cabins\r\nunless Captain Hickson went with them, as the people were so enraged at\r\ntheir dead being molested that they would have killed the police.\r\nFortunately Captain Hickson had enough moral influence to make the\r\npeople obey the law.\r\n\r\nIn the eighties he would have been shot in the back by some scoundrel\r\nwho had primed himself with Dutch courage from adulterated whisky.\r\n\r\nHe raised a Yeomanry Corps at the time of the Whiteboys to guard the\r\ncountry against these lawless bands, and against the dreaded French\r\ninvasion. This regiment was called the Dingle Yeomanry, and the tales\r\nabout it are many.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when Captain Hickson was in London, the general from\r\nDublin inspected the corps. In the absence of the commanding officer,\r\nhis brother was ordered to parade the battalion, and being a nervous\r\nyoung man, he completely forgot all the words of command, so to the\r\nunconcealed amusement of the old martinet from the capital, he\r\nshouted:--\r\n\r\n'Boys, do as you always do.'\r\n\r\nIt says well for the discipline of the regiment that they did not\r\nimplicitly obey the order.\r\n\r\nHis mother, this Mrs. Judith Hickson, was the only one of my\r\ngrand-parents I ever saw, and very little impression she has left on my\r\nmemory, except a notion that she had less sense of humour than pertains\r\nto most Irishwomen by the blessing of God and their own mother wit.\r\n\r\nMy father was a Roman Catholic, and my mother a Protestant. By the terms\r\nof the marriage settlement, we were all brought up in her faith, which\r\noccasioned a tremendous row at that time, and nowadays would never be\r\ntolerated by the priests.\r\n\r\nAll the same my father was an obstinate man, not disposed to care much\r\nfor the whole College of Cardinals, and indifferent if he were cursed\r\nwith bell and book. Of course he was not a good-tempered man, or he\r\nwould not have justified his nickname of Red Precipitate, but he spared\r\nthe rod with me, and failed to keep me in order. I was the youngest of a\r\npretty large family and the pet into the bargain.\r\n\r\nMy eldest brother, John, was drowned at St. Malo. He was unmarried, and\r\nhis profession was to do nothing as handsomely as he could.\r\n\r\nJames was in the 13th Light Dragoons, and subsequently in the 11th. He\r\nsaw no service, and was an excellent soldier at mess and off duty. I am\r\nnot qualified to speak with authority about his fulfilment of the\r\ntrumpery trivialities which fill up garrison life, but here is one\r\nanecdote about him.\r\n\r\nSoon after Lord Cardigan took command of the 13th Light Dragoons, a\r\ngreat many of the officers left the corps, and a man wrote to the papers\r\nto say that this was chiefly due to the great expense of the mess.\r\n\r\nMy brother retorted in print that for his part the reason was due to its\r\nbeing 'incompatible with my feelings as a gentleman to remain in the\r\nregiment as it is equally impossible to exchange out of a regiment that\r\nhas the undeserved misfortune to be commanded by his lordship.'\r\n\r\nEdward lived at Dingle, and was much liked by the people there. He was\r\nan active magistrate and a conscientious man. He married and left two\r\nsons, one in the Horse Artillery and the other a colonel in the\r\nEngineers. They have all joined the great majority.\r\n\r\nRobert, who chose to be an army surgeon, died in India, leaving me\r\nwithout a relation in the world of my own name.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of the story in _Charles O'Malley_ about the old family in\r\nwhich it was hereditary not to have any children. However, I altered\r\nthat by having eleven of my own, two sons, John and Maurice, and four\r\ndaughters being alive, at the present time. More power to them say I, in\r\nthe current phrase of good-will in Kerry.\r\n\r\nMy sister Mary died at Bath when I was born. It was her health which\r\nprevented me from being by birth what I am at heart, a Kerry man.\r\n\r\nEllen was married to Robert, elder brother of the late Knight of Kerry,\r\nand her grand-daughter is married to Colonel Thorneycroft of Spion Kop\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nEllen's sister, Julia, married Sir Peter FitzGerald, Knight of Kerry.\r\nThe two therefore married brothers, and if there had been any more they\r\nmight have done the same.\r\n\r\nI suppose I ought to give the date of my birth, but despite all the\r\nefforts of those in Ireland, who loved me so much that they became\r\nactive agents to convey me to heaven, I cannot yet give you the date of\r\nmy death.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Mr. Townshend Trench, is, I believe, writing a book to prove\r\nthe world will come to an end in about thirty years' time, but that will\r\nsee me out, and those then alive may discover that the Great Landlord\r\nhas given the tenants an extension of the lease of the earth.\r\n\r\nI was born on December 17, 1824, and I have none of those infantile\r\nrecollections which are such an insult on the general attention when put\r\nin print.\r\n\r\nStill my earliest memory is so characteristic of much that was to follow\r\nthat I set it down.\r\n\r\nThe very first thing I remember is being placed on the seat of a trap\r\nbeside the local R.M. (Resident Magistrate), and thus going out,\r\nescorted by a party of soldiers, to collect tithes.\r\n\r\nI clapped my hands with glee, but an old woman by the road-side said\r\nthat it was a shame to take out that innocent babe on such bloodthirsty\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI could ride before I could walk, and was always fond of the exercise.\r\nWhat Irishman is not?\r\n\r\nMy taste for this was fostered by my father, who had broken his leg when\r\nyoung, and not only disliked walking, but had a slight limp, which did\r\nnot prevent him being in the saddle for many hours each day.\r\n\r\nAs a child, I led a fresh, natural, out-of-doors, healthy life, exposed\r\nto wind and rain, and all the better for both. There are very few trees\r\nabout Dingle, and I quite agree with the remark of an American that it\r\nwas the most open country he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nI was always bathing, but I never got drowned, not even in liquor,\r\nalthough I have sat with some of the best in that capacity. I have\r\nmyself been pretty temperate in everything, to which I attribute my\r\nlongevity. And yet I am not sure that any rule can be laid down in this\r\nrespect, for I have known men who saturated themselves in alcohol until\r\nthey ought to have been kept out of sight of all decent people live\r\nlonger than those that have kept straight in every way.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this, let me quote the delightful account of a centagenarian\r\nout of Smith's _History of Kerry_, a book already referred to, and which\r\ncan now be finally put back on its shelf, dry as dust, as Carlyle might\r\nsay, 'but pregnant with food for thought, ay, and for grim\r\nmirth,'--those are not exactly the words of the Sage of Chelsea, but\r\njust have the rub of his tongue about them.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Daniel MacCarty died in February 1751,' as the account said, 'in\r\nthe 112th year of his age. He lived during his whole life in the barony\r\nof Iveragh, and buried four wives. He married a fifth in the\r\neighty-fourth year of his age, and she but a girl of fourteen, by whom\r\nhe had several children. He was always a very healthy man, no cold ever\r\naffecting him, and he could not bear the warmth of a shirt at night, but\r\nput it under his pillow. He drank for many of the last years of his life\r\ngreat quantities of rum and brandy, which he called _the naked truth_;\r\nand if, in compliance to other gentlemen, he drank claret or punch, he\r\nalways took an equal quantity of spirits to qualify those liquors: this\r\nhe called a wedge. No man ever saw him spit. His custom was to walk\r\neight or ten miles in a winter's morning over mountains with greyhounds\r\nand finders, and he seldom failed to bring home a brace of hares. He was\r\nan innocent man, and inherited the social virtues of the antient\r\nMilesians. He was of a florid complexion, looked amazingly well for a\r\nperson of his age and manners of life, for his use of spirituous liquors\r\nwas prodigious, a custom that much prevails in these baronies.'\r\n\r\nIndeed, no one who was slightly acquainted with the characteristics of\r\nthe inhabitants of the Kingdom of Kerry would suggest that total\r\nabstinence was even to-day their predominant virtue.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion to say that it is a good thing to be one of a large\r\nfamily. From a financial point of view I am quite certain that the\r\nreverse is preferable, and as I was the youngest of nine--two others\r\nbesides those I mentioned, James and Anne, coming to early demises--I\r\nreceived as many kicks and cuffs from my brethren as I did halfpence and\r\naffection from my parents. So, like Thackeray, as a child I sympathised\r\nwith Lord MacTurk who wished to cut off the heads of his brethren. Now I\r\nhave survived them all, and I fondly regret the sounds of voices that\r\nare still.\r\n\r\nBut as I sit in my arm-chair and ruminate over the past, which every old\r\nman must do in the intervals of reading the _Times_, going to the club,\r\nor losing his money by careful attention to speculation, I have the\r\nconsolation of remembering that I did as much mischief as any other\r\nchild. To be a really good child means that the animal is a prig or\r\nunhealthy. To-day I am fond of all my grandchildren, but the one I like\r\nbest is the one which proves himself or herself the naughtiest for the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThis is a hard saying for parents, and not a good precept for the young,\r\nbut there is solid truth in it and a bit of common-sense too, for it is\r\nbest to get the original sin out in the years of innocence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest wrench in life is going to school. It may not seem\r\nso very much afterwards--as the boy said of the tooth when he looked at\r\nit in the dentist's forceps--but the wrench is really bad.\r\n\r\nI learned my letters from my mother, and picked up a few other\r\nsmatterings before I had daily lessons from a tutor at Dingle. Strange\r\nto say, a very good classical education could have been obtained there\r\nin the thirties, better, so far as I can estimate, than could have been\r\nexpected from a town double the size at the same period in England.\r\n\r\nAt the age of ten I was sent to Huddard's, then a very sound school in\r\nDublin. I was well enough taught, not caned enough for my deserts,\r\nthough more than sufficed for my feelings, and sufficiently fed, but at\r\nthe end of two years I had to leave owing to ill health.\r\n\r\nAn apothecary, who selfishly recollected that the more medicines I took\r\nthe better for him if not for me, converted me into a human receptacle\r\nfor his empirical abominations, but another surgeon, who was rather\r\ntardily called in, packed me off to the country.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading Dublin physicians certified that I had only one lung;\r\nbut as the other has served me faithfully for sixty-nine years, I am\r\nrather sceptical as to the accuracy of his diagnosis.\r\n\r\nI remember very little about Huddard's, except that it was in Mountjoy\r\nSquare, and about a hundred boys were herded there in unsought\r\nproximity. We boarders always fought the town boys, but also had to\r\ncajole them in humiliating ways to smuggle us in contraband articles of\r\nfood. The meals at Huddard's were fairly good, no doubt, as school fare\r\ngoes, but the sugary stick-jaw stuff for which the soul of a boy longs\r\nwas naturally not part of the official bill of fare. The bullying was of\r\na reasonable nature, or at all events I could hold my own with the best\r\nof them, being indifferent to punishment so long as I could hit out\r\neffectively from the shoulder. One of the ushers, a dwarf of malignant\r\ndisposition, was an awful tyrant, and we always had an ardent desire to\r\ntar and feather him, only we did not know how to set about the operation\r\neven if we had ventured to attempt it.\r\n\r\nAfter a happy interval of convalescence at home, I was sent to a smaller\r\nschool kept by Mr. Hogg at Limerick. One of the boys there subsequently\r\nbecame that illustrious ornament of the Bench, Lord Justice Barry.\r\n\r\nHe was a very eloquent man, counted so even at the Irish Bar, where a\r\ncertain high-flown loquacity is pretty prevalent, and had a great\r\nrepute. He arrived at Cork once, and had to fight his way through a\r\ndense throng to get into court. On inquiring the reason of the crowd, he\r\nwas told that everybody wanted to hear the big speech that was expected\r\nfrom Councillor Barry.\r\n\r\n'Well, unless you make way for me it's disappointed every mother's son\r\nof you will be, for I am twin to Councillor Barry, and I never heard\r\ntell he had a brother.'\r\n\r\nHe carried on the old-fashioned habit of after-dinner conviviality, and\r\nused to sit drinking three hours after the wine had been put on the\r\ntable, which was why I never accepted his hospitality in after years,\r\nfor, as I said before, I am a man of moderation.\r\n\r\nIn my young days it was the regular thing to bring in whisky-punch after\r\ndinner; and for many years I regularly took one tumbler and never had a\r\nsecond, not once to the best of my recollection.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of change in the habits of life. When I was a boy\r\ncoffee was unknown for breakfast, cocoa had not become known as a\r\nbeverage, and tea was regularly drunk. We seldom took lunch, nor did the\r\nladies, and afternoon tea was unheard of. Instead, tea was brought into\r\nthe drawing-room about eight in the evening, and was always drunk very\r\nweak and sweet. In those times it was invariably from China and pretty\r\ncostly.\r\n\r\nWe dined at five. Dinners were very solid. Soup was a pretty regular\r\nopening, but could be dispensed with without comment, and it was almost\r\nalways greasy. At Dingle fish was pretty plentiful, but sweets were\r\nregarded as a great extravagance.\r\n\r\nI remember, when grown up, dining with an elderly man near Cahirciveen,\r\nwho had a turbot for which he must have paid at least eight shillings,\r\nbut he apologised for not having a pudding on account of the necessity\r\nfor economy, though a pudding would not have cost him eightpence.\r\n\r\nMade dishes were very few and badly cooked. The food was chiefly joints,\r\nand, in nine cases out of ten, roast mutton. Vegetables were not so much\r\neaten as now, always excepting potatoes, which were consumed in large\r\nquantities. There was practically no fruit, except a few apples and\r\noranges at Christmas.\r\n\r\nMen sat very long over their wine. Sherry used to be served at dinner\r\nand often claret afterwards, but the great beverage was port. I am\r\ninclined to think that port has sensibly deteriorated since my young\r\ndays. It was as a rule more fruity then, but we never talked of our\r\nlivers, as subalterns and undergraduates do nowadays.\r\n\r\nPort used to come direct to Dingle. It was an easy harbour 'to run,' and\r\nthere was some smuggling.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion some soldiers were sent to protect the gauger, who was\r\nbent on making an important seizure. A few of the inhabitants of Dingle\r\ntook the opportunity of entertaining the officer, and whilst he\r\nslumbered from the effects of their hospitality, the opportunity for\r\nmaking the seizure was lost.\r\n\r\nThere is no particular reason why I should tell the following story\r\nhere, but it is worth recording, and I don't know any other part of my\r\nreminiscences where it is more likely to slip in appropriately.\r\n\r\nIn Kerry in 1815, the farmers had been an extra long time fattening up\r\ntheir pigs. After the Peace, prices all fell, and though the farmers\r\nwere reluctant, they had to yield to circumstances. One day the dealers\r\nwere buying at extremely low rates in Tralee market, when the postman\r\nbrought the news that Napoleon had escaped from Elba.\r\n\r\nInstantly all the farmers broke off their bargains, and proceeded to\r\nstart homeward with their swine, shouting:--\r\n\r\n'Hurrah for Boney that rose the pigs.'\r\n\r\nMy mother often told me of this scene, which she herself witnessed.\r\n\r\nThere was always a distinct sympathy with France, owing to the smuggling\r\nfrom that land, and after the English had prohibited the exportation of\r\nwool, it was smuggled into France, whence were brought back silks and\r\nbrandy.\r\n\r\nThe geography of Kerry is ideal for landing contraband store, and I\r\nshould say even more was done in this respect locally than on the coast\r\nof Scotland.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain amount of good-will between people whose mutual\r\ninterests are similar until they fall out, and the hope of a French\r\nlanding in Ireland, though never very serious, always fanned the native\r\ndisaffection to the Government in the West.\r\n\r\nThe veracity of an Irishman is never considerable, for as a rule he will\r\nsay what he thinks likely to please you rather than state any unpleasant\r\nfact. Of course the gauger--excise officer--was an especially unpopular\r\npersonage, and I doubt if a tithe of the lies told to him were ever\r\nconsidered worthy of being confessed at all.\r\n\r\nO'Connell's family made much money by smuggling, which was a pursuit\r\nthat carried not the slightest moral reproach. Indeed 'to go agin the\r\nGovernment' in any sort of way has always been an act of\r\nsuper-excellence.\r\n\r\nThe most lucrative side of the commercial enterprises of Morgan\r\nO'Connell was his trade in contraband goods. In Derrynane Bay, he and\r\nhis brother landed cargoes which were sent over the hills on horses'\r\nbacks to receivers in Tralee.\r\n\r\nOf O'Connell himself most stories have been told, but it is difficult to\r\nindicate the enormous influence he had over the lower classes in his own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nYears before George IV. had aptly expressed the situation amid his\r\nmaudlin tears over Catholic emancipation.\r\n\r\n'Wellington is King of England, O'Connell is King of Ireland, and I\r\nsuppose I'm only considered Dean of Windsor.'\r\n\r\nAs an advocate, the Liberator had many of the attributes of Kenealy, and\r\nhis popularity was so great that he was often briefed in every case at\r\nan assize.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that he bullied judges, was allowed enormous laxity in\r\nbrowbeating opposing counsel and witnesses, and, like Father O'Flynn,\r\nhad a wonderful way with him, so far as the jury was concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw him in Dublin, I at once realised how true must be the bulk\r\nof the stories of his great conceit. He has been elevated into a\r\nsuperhuman being by the posthumous praise of hundreds of blatant mob\r\norators.\r\n\r\nDan had two brothers, John and James. The latter was the first baronet,\r\nand noted for his witty sayings.\r\n\r\nHe presided at a dinner given for the purpose of presenting an address\r\nto the manager of a bank. On the toast of the Army and Navy being\r\nproposed, the only man who could return thanks for the former was a\r\nsolicitor named Murphy, who said that if he were forced to respond to\r\nthe toast, it clearly proved what a peaceful community they lived in,\r\nadding:--\r\n\r\n'It is such a long time since I laid by the sash and the sword, that I\r\nhave forgotten my drill.'\r\n\r\n'But you have never forgotten the charge,' observed the chairman, who\r\nhad a long bill from Murphy in his pocket at the time.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, a lady spoke to James about subscribing to the\r\nRoman Catholic Cathedral at Killarney.\r\n\r\n'For my part,' she observed, 'it's little I can do in my lifetime, but I\r\nhave left all my money for the good of my soul.'\r\n\r\n'I believe, ma'am,' says James, 'you were an original shareholder in the\r\nProvincial Bank. The shares are now quoted at eighty and they pay six\r\nper cent. That is very much like twenty-one per cent. on the original\r\ncapital.'\r\n\r\n'I am not a clever man like you at making these calculations,' replies\r\nthe lady; 'I have higher and holier things to think about.'\r\n\r\n'Don't say that again to me, ma'am,' says he. 'I put my money into\r\nfarms, and I get five per cent, from a grumbling and unsatisfactory set\r\nof tenants. And what are you getting? Twenty-one per cent. in this world\r\nand salvation in the next. It's the most damnable interest I ever heard\r\ntell of, either in this world or any other.'\r\n\r\nYet another tale about him.\r\n\r\nHe had received an unconscionable bill of costs from an attorney, and\r\nhappening to meet a Roman Catholic bishop in Cork, he asked him if an\r\nattorney could ever be saved.\r\n\r\n'Why not? Even an extortioner can be if he make ample restitution in his\r\nlife-time, and dies fortified with the rites of the Church.'\r\n\r\n'May be so, my lord,' replied Sir James, 'you know more about these\r\nthings than I do, but if it is as you say, you are taking a confounded\r\namount of unnecessary trouble about the rest of us.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop was not a bit disconcerted.\r\n\r\n'I am an honest labourer striving to be worthy of my hire,' he\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nAnd at that Sir James left it, because he said it was not respectful to\r\nask too many invidious questions about a man who had the making of your\r\nsoul at his own will.\r\n\r\nAll this is a digression from my education, which was as desultory as\r\nthese reminiscences.\r\n\r\nAfter a spell at Limerick I was again sent home ill, and for six months\r\nI really had to be treated as an invalid. I was always very fond of\r\nbooks, notably history, and I think I have read pretty well every book\r\npublished upon the history of Ireland. It was at this time I began\r\nteaching myself a bit, and that is the teaching which is better than any\r\nother, except what one has to learn against one's own will and for one's\r\nown advantage in the school of life. Like a good many other people I was\r\nled to history not only by a shortage of lighter books at home, but also\r\nby curiosity aroused by the novels of Sir Walter Scott. In the way of\r\npromoting better reading, I believe Scott has been far more beneficial\r\nthan any other writer of fiction in English.\r\n\r\nI was for a short time at school in Exeter, and then at a rather rough\r\nestablishment at Woolwich, where my father wished me to have the tuition\r\nin mathematics which could be obtained from the masters in the Academy\r\nat irregular times. By all accounts the fagging and bullying in that\r\nestablishment were appalling. The headmaster of the school I was at was\r\nan able fellow, and many of the cadets used to come to have a grind with\r\nhim. Some of their tales were 'hair-erectors,' as the Americans say.\r\n\r\nOne new boy had the misfortune to sprain his ankle, and to incur the\r\nfury of the head of dormitory on the same evening. The latter tied his\r\ngame ankle up to his thigh, and fastening him by the wrist to the bottom\r\nof the bed, made him stand the better part of the night on his bad\r\nankle.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of the story of a certain royal prince going to an\r\neducational establishment and being asked who his parents were. On his\r\nreply, the senior--or 'John'--gave him a terrific _cuff_ on the side of\r\nthe head saying:--\r\n\r\n'That's for your father, the prince.'\r\n\r\nAnd before the half-stunned boy recovered, he received a stinging blow\r\non the other ear with:--\r\n\r\n'That's for your mother, the princess, and now black my boots.'\r\n\r\nHis Highness could say nothing, but in time he grew to be the biggest\r\nand the worst bully.\r\n\r\nThen the younger brother of his former tormentor came, and the prince\r\nsent for him, and telling him what his brother had done some years\r\nbefore, made him bend down and flogged him so unmercifully that he had\r\nto go into hospital.\r\n\r\nYears after, when in an important position, he met his former victim,\r\nnow a general, and congratulating him on his career said:--\r\n\r\n'Perhaps I made your success by giving you that tanning at Sandhurst.'\r\n\r\nI wonder whether there was murder in the heart of the grim old warrior\r\nat the recollection. Of course that would not be strange, for many a\r\ntime officers have been actually shot in action by their own men.\r\n\r\nHere is a perfectly true story, only neither the men nor the officer\r\nneed be specified.\r\n\r\nA colonel who had grossly mismanaged the regiment knew his fate was\r\nsealed.\r\n\r\nSo when the men paraded for the engagement, he said:--\r\n\r\n'I know you mean to shoot me to-day, but for God's sake don't do so\r\nuntil we have won the battle.'\r\n\r\nThis was greeted with a cheer, and he came back safe to be decorated and\r\nto play whist at his club as badly as any member in it.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that cards ought not to be considered part of every lad's\r\ntraining. If a man goes through life without touching a card, he\r\nprobably loses a good deal of innocent amusement, and debars himself\r\nfrom much pleasant society. If he learns to play when grown up, he may\r\nfind it a costly and unsatisfactory branch of education. But if he is\r\ntaught to play reasonably well as a boy, and is shown that excellent\r\ngames can be had without gambling--I do not consider an infinitesimal\r\nstake, in proportion to his means, gambling--he will have an extra\r\namusement made for him and a relaxation after his day's work.\r\n\r\nA near relative of my own gets his club cronies to play bridge with his\r\nson, aged eighteen, and pays his losses, in order that he may be\r\nthoroughly grounded in the game. The lad is a capital boy, and all the\r\nbetter for his early association with elder men on their own level.\r\n\r\nOne of the resources of my old age is three games of picquet every night\r\nafter dinner with my wife, and very much I enjoy them. There is often\r\nthe fashionable bridge played in the room by my children and their\r\nfriends, but I have never taken a hand, though in younger days I derived\r\na fair amount of diversion from whist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFARMING\r\n\r\n\r\nMy years of schooling having come to an end, I was back in Ireland in\r\nfull enjoyment of youth, high spirits, and thoughtless carelessness.\r\nThese holiday times were delightful. I could be in the saddle all day if\r\nI liked, was free to shoot or bathe as I pleased, had dogs at my\r\ndisposal, could pass the time of day with all sorts and conditions of\r\nmen--a thing which I have relished all my life--and in fact led the gay\r\nexistence of the younger offshoot of an Irish squire.\r\n\r\nIn those days things were not so impecunious in Ireland as they\r\nsubsequently became, but there was always a vivacious Hibernian scorn\r\nfor false pretension, and a determination to have the best possible\r\ntime, such as you can read in Lever's novels of old, and the capital\r\ntales of those two clever ladies, Miss Martin and Miss Somerville,\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true that there are many Irish landlords in sporting\r\ncounties who cannot have three hundred a year, and yet all their sons\r\nand daughters manage to hunt four days a week.\r\n\r\nThis would be impossible out of Ireland, and is absolutely\r\nincomprehensible even there; but the fact remains that it is done, and\r\nall one can remark is to echo the patter of the conjuror:--\r\n\r\n'Wonderful, isn't it?'\r\n\r\nI, however, was not destined to be left a derelict at home, as falls to\r\nthe hapless lot of far too many good fellows in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many family counsels, and the authorities could not\r\nmake up their minds what to do with me. However, I thought farming was\r\nthe idlest occupation, and suggested it should be my profession--an idea\r\nhailed with rapture, principally because it saved everybody the trouble\r\nof racking their brains about me.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have often regretted that what in modern phrase may be\r\ncalled the 'Stevenson boom' did not coincide with my search for a\r\ncareer. Big posts were in due time going for engineers; and those young\r\nmen who had the stamp of apprenticeship to, or association with, the\r\ngreat man could get almost anything in the days of the fever for railway\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nEven later than the period I am now recalling, the journey from Dublin\r\nto Dingle would take more than two days, and, so far as I can recollect,\r\nit certainly took five from Dingle to London. Those coaching journeys\r\nwere terrible experiences in wet weather, for you were drenched outside\r\nand suffocated inside, whilst you paid more than three times the present\r\nrailway fare for the miserable privilege of this uncomfortable means of\r\ntransit.\r\n\r\nThe old posting hotels used to be uncommonly good and comfortable,\r\nwhilst they did a thriving trade. The coach purported to give you ample\r\ntime to breakfast and dine at certain capital hostels, but by a private\r\narrangement between mine host and the guard and driver, the meals used\r\nto be abruptly closured in order to save the landlord's larder.\r\n\r\nOn the way down from Dublin, a thirty minutes' pause was allowed at Naas\r\nfor breakfast; but on the occasion of my story, as well as on every\r\nother, after a quarter of an hour the waiter announced the coach was\r\njust starting.\r\n\r\nEverybody ran out to regain their seats, except one commercial\r\ntraveller, who picked up all the teaspoons and put them in the teapot\r\nbefore calmly resuming his meal.\r\n\r\nBack came the waiter with:--\r\n\r\n'Not a moment to spare, sir.'\r\n\r\n'All right,' said the traveller; 'which of the passengers has taken the\r\nteaspoons?'\r\n\r\nThe waiter gave one glance of horror, and then proceeded to have every\r\none on the coach examined for the missing articles.\r\n\r\nBy the time that the commercial traveller had calmly finished a hearty\r\nmeal there was nearly a riot, and then he emerged from the coffee-room,\r\nand suggested that the waiter had better look in the teapot.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I don't fancy that he regularly travelled on that road, for\r\nhe would have been a marked man at Naas for years to come.\r\n\r\nI was seventeen at the time when I had decided, with parental\r\nacquiescence, to be a farmer, and I was sent to learn my profession to\r\nthe south of Scotland, to a farmer named Bogue.\r\n\r\nI there acquired, at all events, one curious fact, which has stuck in my\r\nhead ever since, and it is thus:--\r\n\r\nScotland and Ireland are governed by the same Sovereign, Lords, and\r\nCommons. Scotland is the best farmed country in Europe, and Ireland\r\nabout the worst.\r\n\r\nOne pair of horses in Scotland were then supposed to cultivate fifty\r\nacres of tillage, and in Ireland the average was one horse to five\r\nacres. Indeed it is in both cases much the same to-day.\r\n\r\nIn reality a farm is a workshop from which you turn out as much produce\r\nas possible. But on an Irish farm it is the habit to squeeze out the\r\nlast possible ounce without putting anything in, for it is not run with\r\nan eye on future years, but only in a hand-to-mouth, beggar-the-soil\r\nkind of way, without a thought beyond contemporary exigencies.\r\n\r\nThere were several other pupils with Bogue, but I stuck to the business\r\nmore than the rest, who were perpetually gallivanting into Kelso, or\r\neven going up to Edinburgh, where they learnt nothing which taught them\r\ntheir trade or put money into their pockets. Therefore it happened that\r\nI was selected by Bogue to have an excellent practical demonstration of\r\nfarming, after this wise. He had a pretty sharp illness, and left me for\r\na short time full management of all his six hundred acres, and that bit\r\nof responsibility made a man of me once and for all. I stepped out of\r\nboyhood instantly, and became an adult in feelings and bearing; but to\r\nthis day I hope my sense of fun is only keener than it was as a lad.\r\n\r\nI acquired a good deal of common sense in Scotland, and learnt to\r\nobserve for myself, a thing many men never acquire, and on their\r\ndeathbeds they will never be able to enumerate the opportunities they\r\nhave consequently lost.\r\n\r\nAs I was to be a farmer, I thought it was no use to confine my attention\r\nto the one I was on, but contracted the habit, when work was at all\r\nslack, of going about to pick up what wrinkles I could from other\r\nproprietors, as well as to make observations on my own account.\r\n\r\nSubsequently I have made two agricultural tours through Scotland for the\r\nsame purpose, getting as far north as Sutherland, in order to find out\r\nhow the Highland farmer dealt with more barren soil under a less\r\npropitious climate. I have noted more improvement in farming in Ayrshire\r\nin the interval than in any other county. Yet there is a letter in\r\nexistence by Burns in which he observes that Ayrshire lairds are getting\r\nEnglish and East Lothian notions about rents, and raising them so high\r\nthat it will soon be a wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Scotsman is a farmer by nature, but the Irishman is\r\na farmer by inclination.\r\n\r\nAn Irishman tries to exist on land cultivated by the minimum amount of\r\nlabour, and does not farm a bit better if his land is cheaper.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer in Scotland and England is laying down his land in grass,\r\nand giving up tillage as fast as he can. It is notorious that Ireland is\r\nmore suitable for pasture than tillage, and yet the Government have\r\nconstituted a Board to break up the rich grazing lands in Ireland and\r\ndivide them into small tillage farms, on which the tenants could not get\r\na decent living even if they had it free of rent and taxes.\r\n\r\nOld Bogue was a bachelor by profession, and his polygamistic tendencies\r\nwere duly concealed, though pretty generally known, as most things are\r\nin the country. He had as housekeeper a woman so skinny that it made you\r\nfeel cold to look at her, and her disposition was on a par with her\r\nappearance. Of course, it suited the national thrift, particularly\r\ncongenial to Bogue, to feed us meanly, but we did not relish her\r\nparsimonious economies.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing none of us might shirk, and that was regular\r\nattendance at kirk on Sunday. I have been a church-going man all my\r\nlife--in my late years in London I have especially appreciated the\r\nbeautiful services at St. Anne's, Soho--but the kirk has always been the\r\nbreaking of precious ointment over an unworthy head, so far as I am\r\nconcerned. The improvised prayer, that is always so carefully prepared,\r\nand is often one delivered in regular rotation, always seems to me\r\nrather humbugging for that reason, and the tremendously long sermons,\r\nwhich have a minimum of three quarters of an hour, no matter what the\r\ntext or the ability of the preacher, are to me a vexation of spirit. I\r\nhave occasionally heard good sermons in kirk, but I think the standard\r\nof Scottish preaching has always been overrated.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I agree in the main with the American critic of sermons, who\r\nsaid if a preacher can't strike ile in ten minutes he has got a bad\r\norgan, or he is boring in the wrong place. It is always unfair to bore\r\nin the pulpit, because the congregation have no means of retaliation\r\nexcept by subsequently staying away, and in the country that is not\r\ncompatible with the public worship of their Maker.\r\n\r\nWe have all heard the traditional stories about the divines who, having\r\nfound the sand of the hour-glass exhausted, calmly reversed it and\r\ncontinued for a second spell, to the complete satisfaction of the\r\ncongregations. But in my experience only one preacher could have done\r\nthat without unendurably provoking me, and he was Archbishop Magee, of\r\nwhom I shall have something to say when I am dealing with County Cork.\r\n\r\nFor the Scots in character I conceived much respect and little\r\nenthusiasm. If there is anything more remarkable than the hard-working\r\npowers of the Scottish farmer it is his capacity for hard drinking. But\r\nthat only makes him offensive in his brief conviviality and morose in\r\nthe long subsequent sulkiness. Whereas I defy you to be seriously angry\r\nwith a drunken Irishman, if you have a due sense of humour--and without\r\nthat you have lost the salt of life. To my mind there is something\r\naustere in the better characteristics of the Scot, and also something\r\nhypocritical about his morality. You always hear that professed in\r\nScotland, and never in Ireland. But in the latter fewer illegitimate\r\nchildren are born than in any other country in Europe, and in\r\nScotland--notably Glasgow--the high percentage has become sadly\r\nproverbial. Yet, despite these adverse points, the Scottish character\r\nhas a native grandeur which must provoke admiration, though all my\r\nwarmth of feelings goes to my own oft-erring countrymen.\r\n\r\nI returned to Ireland in 1843 with the intention of farming in Kerry on\r\nthe scientific system I had learned in Berwickshire. However, I found\r\nthe land so subdivided that it was not only difficult, but impossible,\r\nto obtain a farm of sufficient size to return a reasonable percentage on\r\nthe necessary outlay. The population of Kerry was then 293,880, and the\r\nland was divided into 25,848 farms, the holders of which, I may say,\r\nentirely depended for existence on 26,030 acres of potatoes. To give an\r\nexample of the intense love of subdivision, I knew a case where one\r\nhorse was the property of three 'farmers,' and as they differed as to\r\nwho was to pay for the fourth shoe, they sold the horse, which was\r\nbought by an uncle of mine.\r\n\r\nFew farmers ate meat except at Christmas. They wore homespun flannel and\r\nfrieze, and their only luxury, whisky, was obtainable at a quarter of\r\nits present price. A young couple were considered ready to start in\r\nmarried life when they had obtained a 'farm,' consisting of a couple of\r\nacres for potatoes and a mud hovel for themselves; and thus a\r\npopulation, dependent on a precarious root, increased very rapidly. It\r\nwas thicker near the sea coast than inland. The rents then were about\r\ndouble what they are now (though half what they had been at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century), yet, with good potato crops,\r\npeople seemed content and times were fairly good. I should say there was\r\nnot such general drunkenness as in later times, and very little porter\r\nwas consumed in those days--at all events outside Dublin. What schools\r\nthere were were shockingly bad, and reading, not to say writing, was an\r\nexceptional accomplishment, not only among the labouring classes, but\r\namong those who held their heads much higher. This of course impressed\r\nme coming straight from Scotland, where a really grand education has\r\nbeen the national birthright for generations.\r\n\r\nI began to farm about sixty acres near Dingle, and gave my entire time\r\nto it, an assiduity I have compared in my mind to that of the Norwegian\r\nreclaiming the little arable spots on the mountain. We both worked\r\npretty hard for very scanty results. I did not even live on my tiny\r\nproperty, but with my mother--my father had died after I returned from\r\nmy English schools and before I went to Kelso.\r\n\r\nStill matters were not long satisfactory, owing to the failure of the\r\npotato crop in 1845, when the mortality became fearful in consequence.\r\n\r\nSo at the very end of the year I migrated from Kerry to become an\r\nassistant land agent in Cork, and thus really embarked on the profession\r\nof my life--one which, on the whole, I have most thoroughly and heartily\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nI hoped then that I had not done with my beloved Kerry, and my\r\nassociation with that great kingdom has indeed been lifelong. I have\r\nalways understood the feeling of the Irish emigrants who have had sods\r\nof their native earth sent out to them to the New World. _Heimweh_ is\r\nafter all a good thing, and Kerry to me would always seem to be\r\nappealing, however far I had roamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLAND AGENT IN CORK\r\n\r\n\r\nHad I been able to obtain a reasonably large farm near Dingle, I should\r\nnever have become a land agent, and I most certainly should never have\r\ngiven evidence before any Commission.\r\n\r\nIn default of adequate land accommodation, I embarked on my profession\r\nby becoming assistant land agent to my brother-in-law, the Knight of\r\nKerry, who was agent to Sir George Colthurst. I lived with the Knight at\r\nInniscarra in County Cork, not far from Blarney.\r\n\r\nFrom that time onward I worked steadily, and as I take my ease at the\r\nCarlton to-day, I really feel I have done as much honest labour in my\r\ncareer as has any man.\r\n\r\nIn proof I may cite a day's record some years later, taken almost at\r\nrandom from my diary.\r\n\r\nI began with an hour in my Cork office, went by train to Killarney, a\r\njourney of three and a half hours, where I spent three hours in my\r\noffice, and then by train on to Tralee, a further one and a quarter\r\nhours, where I had an hour and a half in my office in that town, and\r\nthen drove out to Edenburn, seven miles, to sleep. That done fairly\r\noften makes a decided strain on endurance and mental concentration,\r\nbecause the affairs at each place were of course for different landlords\r\nand needed the memorising of a fresh section of business all absolutely\r\nintrusted to me, whilst the train service in Kerry then and now is not\r\ncalculated to promote mental tranquillity or facilitate business.\r\n\r\nHaving alluded to my diary, I had better explain that I kept no journal\r\nuntil 1852, and subsequently to that year it consisted merely of bald\r\nmemoranda of my movements; therefore it has not been of the least use in\r\npreparing these reminiscences.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 I became a Government Inspector of Land Improvements and\r\nDrainage Works, and in that capacity went to Bantry, where I saw the\r\nappalling destitution caused by the famine, with which I shall deal in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nI had made application for this post before I left Kerry, directly I had\r\nfound my farm too small for my requirements, and I received the\r\nappointment from the Chairman of the Irish Board of Works. Practically\r\nspeaking the pay was about a pound a day with allowances.\r\n\r\nThis post in no way interfered with my duties as a land agent then, but\r\nI afterwards resigned it owing to the increasing exigencies of my\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to detail for readers other than Irish what are the\r\navocations of a land agent, especially as the class in Ireland will\r\nprobably soon be as extinct as the dodo.\r\n\r\nThe duties of an Irish land agent comprise a great deal of office work,\r\ndrawing up agreements with tenants, receiving rent, superintending\r\nagricultural and all landlords' improvements, sitting as magistrate and\r\nrepresenting the landlord when the latter is absent at poor-law\r\nmeetings, road sessions, and on grand juries.\r\n\r\nWith very rare exceptions the salary has been five per cent, on the\r\nrents received. So the agent has been paid five per cent, on all the\r\nmoney he has put into the landlord's pockets, whilst an architect has\r\nalways received five per cent. on all he took out of them, an\r\narrangement which in the latter instance has not worked at all well for\r\nthe landlords.\r\n\r\nThe tendency has gradually been to consolidate and amalgamate land\r\nagencies, for as the difficulty of getting rents increased, more\r\ncompetent men of experience and judgment were needed by the landlords.\r\nAs a proof of the trust reposed in me, I may mention that at one time I\r\nreceived the rents of one-fifth of the whole county of Kerry--and that\r\nin the worst times.\r\n\r\nSuch a task is not one to be envied, however joyously a man may take up\r\nthe burden of his daily toil, and of course the agents as the outward\r\nand visible signs of the distant or absentee landlords obtained the\r\ngreater share of the hatred felt for the latter.\r\n\r\nIn the worst period Lord Derby received threats that if he did not\r\nreduce his rents, his agent would be murdered.\r\n\r\nHe coolly replied:--\r\n\r\n'If you think you will intimidate me by shooting my agent you are\r\ngreatly mistaken.'\r\n\r\nThat is exactly the reply the agents desired the landlords to make, but\r\nit did not conduce to making their own existences any the more secure or\r\nenviable.\r\n\r\nOf course in the due working out of the Wyndham Act, land agents will be\r\nutterly ruined.\r\n\r\nThere are no openings for them because they are too old to commence\r\nlearning another profession, and they will not get employment under the\r\nCounty Council because they belong to the landlord class and have\r\nunflinchingly fought the battles of the landlords.\r\n\r\nThe agents are a class who have devoted their time and risked their\r\nlives in order to get in the rents due to their employers, and there is\r\nnot the smallest chance--save in a few isolated and exceptional\r\ncases--of their being kept on when the landlords will have only their\r\nown demesne in their own hands and employ some underling, such as a\r\nbailiff in England, to collect the stray rents of the few cottagers who\r\nmay still chance to be tenants.\r\n\r\nJudge Ross stated that there was no more deserving or painstaking class\r\nin Ireland than the land agents, and he considered it a great hardship\r\nthat under the Wyndham Act they obtain no compensation.\r\n\r\nBy agreement in most cases they receive three per cent. of the purchase\r\nmoney, but that is a very poor sinking fund to provide for a middle-aged\r\ngentleman, who has probably a family to support; and absolute bankruptcy\r\nmust be the result if there is, as on several large properties, an agent\r\nwith a couple of assistants.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ashbourne Act was passed in 1885, it was never contemplated\r\nthat the purchases would be on a wholesale scale. As a matter of fact\r\nonly a few estates were sold, and on the purchase price of one of those\r\nfor which I was agent I received two per cent. It should be also borne\r\nin mind that the profession of a land agent in Ireland is on a far\r\nhigher social plane than in England. In many cases the younger son or\r\nbrother of the landlord is the agent for the family property; and in\r\nsome instances this has worked uncommonly well. In other cases,\r\ngentlemen by birth conducted the business, or else the administration of\r\nseveral estates was consolidated and carried on from one office.\r\n\r\nIn every case the billet was regarded as one for life, only forfeited by\r\ngross misconduct, and the relations between landlord and agent have been\r\nnearly always of an intimate and cordial character. Each agent began as\r\nan assistant, obtaining an independent post by selection and influence,\r\nand few entered the profession unless they had reasonable prospects of a\r\ndefinite post on their own account in due course.\r\n\r\nIn my time the landlord was the sole judge of the agent's\r\nqualifications, but the profession has become a branch of the\r\nEngineering Surveyor's Institution.\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined, there are now remarkably few candidates for the\r\nnecessary examinations, because it is virtually annihilated.\r\n\r\nThings were very different when I embarked without mistrust on a career\r\nwhich has landed me comfortably into my eighties, although under\r\nGovernment every appointment has to be compulsorily vacated at the age\r\nof sixty-five. No one starting now could anticipate any such result in\r\nold age, and so without affectation I can say _autres temps autres\r\nmoeurs_, which may be freely translated as 'present times much the\r\nworst.'\r\n\r\nMore pleasant is it to turn to a few brief memories of Cork. It was a\r\ncheerful place at the time I am speaking of, for there was plenty of\r\nentertaining and truly genial hospitality. The general depression caused\r\nby famine, fever, and Fenians hardly affected the great town, and after\r\nthose funereal shadows had once passed, Cork was as gay as any one could\r\nreasonably desire.\r\n\r\nThe townsfolk are very witty and clever at giving nicknames, as the\r\nfollowing little tales will show.\r\n\r\nWhen a citizen in Cork makes money, he generally builds a house, and the\r\nhigher up the hill his house is situated, the more is thought of him.\r\n\r\nMr. Doneghan, a highly respectable tallow chandler, built a fine\r\nresidence early in the nineteenth century, which he called Waterloo.\r\n\r\nThe populace said it should have been named Talavera (_i.e._\r\nTallow-vera), and as that it is known to this day.\r\n\r\nMr. Maguire, who was Member for Cork, and Lord Mayor of the City into\r\nthe bargain, was very influential in the promotion of a gas company.\r\nWith the money he made out of it, he reared a rather lofty mansion,\r\nwhich was promptly christened the Lighthouse.\r\n\r\nAll butter in Cork is sold at the wharves, and the casks are branded\r\nwith the quality of the butter they contain. One man made a fortune out\r\nof the first class butter on its merits, and out of the sixth class\r\nbutter, which he put in the first class casks and sold on the testimony\r\nof the brand on the wood. This became in time notorious to most people\r\nexcept the more unsophisticated of his clients, and when he embarked on\r\nbricks and mortar his house was generally known as Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nOne more and I have done with these baptismal sobriquets.\r\n\r\nA lady on a Queenstown steamer had put her foot down the bunker's hole,\r\nand broke her ankle through the accident. She brought an action against\r\nthe company, duly proved negligence on the part of the employés, and\r\nobtained substantial damages. These considerably assisted her in\r\nerecting a rather attractive mansion, which she decidedly resented being\r\ncalled Bunker's Hill.\r\n\r\nSome people have their own ideas about the definition of a gentleman, as\r\na certain rather diminutive racing man found to his cost.\r\n\r\nIt was at a meeting close to Cork, and he was standing next a burly\r\nfarmer close to the rails when the horses were nearly ready to start.\r\n\r\nPointing to one disreputable-looking ruffian about to mount, he\r\nobserved:--\r\n\r\n'That fellow has no pretensions to be a gentleman-rider.'\r\n\r\nThe farmer caught him by the collar of his coat and the seat of his\r\nbreeches, and shook him as a mastiff would a rat.\r\n\r\n'Mind yourself, small man,' said he, 'that's a recognised gentleman in\r\nthese parts.'\r\n\r\nThere was a mighty shindy, and when the farmer was told his victim was a\r\nprominent English peer, he retorted:--\r\n\r\n'Well, that won't make him a judge of an Irish gentleman.'\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I mentioned that the preacher I most admired was\r\nArchbishop Magee. I had the privilege of frequently hearing him in Cork,\r\nwhere he drew crowded congregations to a temporary church--the cathedral\r\nbeing under repair.\r\n\r\nI never heard any one who so magnetised me from the pulpit, and I am by\r\nno means prone to admire sermons. There was a sort of mesmerism in the\r\nvery eloquence of Magee which kept my eyes riveted on his lips--rather\r\nbig, bulgy lips in an expressive, sensitive face. An hour beneath him\r\nsped marvellously fast, and more than once in Cork I have heard him\r\npreach for that length. The impression he made on me has never been\r\neffaced, and it was with no surprise I learnt in due course that he\r\nbecame Archbishop of York.\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Derby said that the most eloquent speech he ever heard in\r\nor out of the House of Lords was Magee's speech on the Church Act, the\r\nperoration of which--quoting from memory after many years--ran:--'My\r\nLords, I will not, I cannot, and I dare not vote for that most\r\nunhallowed bill which lies on your Lordships' table.'\r\n\r\nHave all Magee stories been told?\r\n\r\nI am afraid so. Yet in the hope that a few may be new to some, though\r\nold to others--who are invited to skip them--here are just a small\r\nbatch.\r\n\r\nWhen he was a dean, he one day attended a debate on tithes in the House\r\nof Commons, and was subsequently putting on his overcoat, when a Radical\r\nMember courteously assisted him, whereupon he remarked:--\r\n\r\n'I am very much obliged to you, sir, for reversing the policy of your\r\nfriends inside, who are taking the coats off our backs.'\r\n\r\nThis was equalled by the wife of an Irish landlord who lost her purse in\r\nthe Ladies' Gallery of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gladstone, who had been sitting next her, after kindly assisting in\r\nthe ineffectual search, observed:--\r\n\r\n'I hope there was not much in it.'\r\n\r\n'No, it was a nice little purse I had had for a long time, but thanks to\r\nyour husband there was nothing in it.'\r\n\r\nAn Irish story of Magee's concerns an Orange clergyman in Fermanagh, who\r\nasked leave to preach a sermon by Magee. Now, this clergyman, who was an\r\nambitious man, was rather ashamed of his mother, and would not let her\r\nlive at the parsonage, but had taken lodgings for her in the town.\r\nMagee, moreover, always a moderate man, did not like Orange sermons, and\r\nmost certainly had never composed one. As he good naturedly did not want\r\nto offend the other, he said he would give him a capital sermon to\r\ndeliver if he--Magee--might select the text.\r\n\r\n'Of course, of course,' assented the other; 'what is it?'\r\n\r\n'\"From that time His disciple took her to his own house.\"'\r\n\r\nEven this was hardly so cutting as his remark, when a bishop, to a\r\nclergyman of whom he did not think highly, but who upbraided him for not\r\ngiving him a living.\r\n\r\n'Sir, if it were raining livings, the utmost I could do would be to lend\r\nyou an umbrella.'\r\n\r\nMention of Magee suggests an ecclesiastical tale concerning a most\r\nconvivial attorney--George Faith by name--who had rather a red nose,\r\nwhich he explained was caused by wearing tight boots.\r\n\r\nHis father in old age got married a second time, and George was asked\r\nwhy his stepmother was like Dr. Newman.\r\n\r\nThe answer was because she had embraced the ancient Faith.\r\n\r\nAmong old time Irish members, Joe Ronayne, M.P. for Cork, was among the\r\nmost diverting.\r\n\r\nHe was a railway contractor, and much wanted some additional ground at\r\nthe terminus of the line, which the proprietor, Lord Ventry, would not\r\nsell.\r\n\r\nThe size of the coveted patch was only seven feet long by three broad.\r\nMr. Ronayne grimly retorted:--\r\n\r\n'That's very strange, for it is exactly the amount of ground I'd like to\r\ngive him,' i.e. for his grave.\r\n\r\nAnother experience of Ronayne's was to the following tune.\r\n\r\nHe had obtained advances from a local bank for his railway contract to\r\nthe satisfaction of both parties, and when asked by the manager for some\r\nwrinkles about the making of a railway, replied:--\r\n\r\n'The best thing is to run it into a soft bank.'\r\n\r\nHe was a plucky chap as well as a witty one, for owing to some internal\r\nmalady, from which he died, he had to have his leg amputated, at the\r\nsame time resigning his seat for Cork.\r\n\r\nAddressing the surgeon, he observed:--\r\n\r\n'I cannot stand for the borough any longer, but I shall certainly stump\r\nthe constituency as a county candidate.'\r\n\r\nPoor fellow, he was all too soon an accepted candidate for his passage\r\nover to the great majority.\r\n\r\nA certain attorney named Nagle used to do most of his work.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of another attorney this Nagle remarked:--\r\n\r\n'He has the heart of a vulture.'\r\n\r\n'I know what's worse,' was Ronayne's comment.\r\n\r\n'Indeed!'\r\n\r\n'Yes; the bill of an aigle' (which is the broad Cork pronunciation of\r\neagle).\r\n\r\nThis Nagle was not remarkable for the extent of his ablutions.\r\n\r\nAt one period, when he was becoming an ardent Radical, an obsequious\r\ntoady said:--\r\n\r\n'You'll become a second Marat.'\r\n\r\n'There's no fear that he will die in the same place,' promptly came from\r\nRonayne.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the two were waiting for the judges outside their\r\nlodgings during the Assizes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ronayne, in the hearing of a number of acquaintances, called\r\nout:--\r\n\r\n'You had better come away at once, Nagle.'\r\n\r\n'Why should I?' indignantly.\r\n\r\n'If you stop five minutes longer there's a shower of rain coming on and\r\nyou might get washed.'\r\n\r\nOn a third occasion, Nagle told Ronayne he was going to invest some\r\nmoney in a mining exploration.\r\n\r\n'Explore your own landed property, my dear fellow,' was Ronayne's\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n'But you know I have not got any.'\r\n\r\n'Good Heavens, you don't mean to say you have cleaned your nails?'\r\n\r\nThough he was an out-and-out Fenian, Ronayne was as honest a man as I\r\never met, and he was considered one of the most amusing men in the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\nThe attorneys in Cork at one time formed quite a small coterie, who\r\ndivided all the business until it grew too much for them, one, Mr. Paul\r\nWallace, being especially harassed with briefs.\r\n\r\nAt length a barrister named Graves came down from Dublin, and was\r\nintroduced to Wallace by another attorney with the remark:--\r\n\r\n'Counsel are very necessary.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Wallace; 'as a matter of fact, we are all being driven to\r\nour graves.'\r\n\r\nAt Kanturk Sessions, Mr. Philip O'Connell was consulted by a client\r\nabout the recovery of a debt. He at once saw that the defence would be a\r\npleading of the statute of limitations, so he told his client that if he\r\ncould get a man to swear that the debtor had admitted the debt within\r\nthe last six years, he would succeed, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nO'Connell went off to take the chair at a Bar dinner to a new County\r\nCourt judge.\r\n\r\nAs the dessert was being set on the table, a loud knock came at the\r\ndoor, which was immediately behind the chairman.\r\n\r\n'What is it?' cried O'Connell.\r\n\r\nA head appeared, and the voice from it explained:--\r\n\r\n'I'm Tim Flaherty, your honour, as was consulting you outside, and I\r\nwant you to come this way for a while.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you see I am engaged and cannot come?'\r\n\r\n'But it's pressing and important.'\r\n\r\n'I tell you I won't come.'\r\n\r\nThen at the top of his voice Tim yelled:--\r\n\r\n'Will a small woman do as well, your honour?'\r\n\r\nThe members of the Bar present, quite unaware of the previous\r\nconversation, exploded in a shout of laughter, and it was long before\r\nO'Connell heard the last of the invidious construction they put on the\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting people I came across in the vicinity of Cork was\r\nMr. Jeffreys, who up to his death in 1862 was the most enterprising and\r\nexperimental landed proprietor in the county. He imported Scottish\r\nstewards, and people from far and near came to see his farms.\r\n\r\nI should say that in the fifties he did more for agriculture than any\r\nother one man who could be named in Ireland.\r\n\r\nHe often said to me:--\r\n\r\n'The system of small farms will not last long in Ireland, for the\r\noccupiers are sure to strike against rents.'\r\n\r\nHe did not live to see the fulfilment of his prophecy, but its effects\r\nwere felt by his grandson, Sir George Colthurst, who inherited his\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nMost of his stories were very improper, but their wit excused them.\r\n\r\nIn the Kildare Street Club one day he saw a very pompous individual, and\r\nasked who he was.\r\n\r\n'That's So-and-So, and the odd thing is he is the youngest of four\r\nbrothers, who are all married without having a child between them.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, that accounts for his importance--he is the last of the Barons.'\r\n\r\nFinding him very meditative in the County Club at Cork one Friday, I\r\nasked him what was the matter.\r\n\r\n'I am making my soul,' said he. 'I began my dinner with turbot and ended\r\nwith scollops.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFAMINE AND FEVER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to revert to that terrible page of Irish history,\r\nthe famine, which culminated in what is still known as 'the black\r\nforty-seven.'\r\n\r\nI have often been asked, 'How is it that Ireland could formerly support\r\na population of eight millions as compared with only five now?'\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple: Eight millions could still exist if the potato\r\ncrop were a certainty, and if the people were now content to exist as\r\nthey did then. But to the then existing population--living at best in a\r\nlight-hearted and hopeful, hand-to-mouth contentment--there was a\r\nterrible awakening.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious blight, which had affected the potato in America in 1844,\r\nhad not been felt in Ireland, where the harvest for 1845 promised to be\r\nsingularly abundant. Suddenly, almost without warning, the later crop\r\nshrivelled and wasted.\r\n\r\nThe poor had a terribly hard winter, and the farmers borrowed heavily to\r\nhave means to till a larger amount of land in 1846.\r\n\r\nOnce more the early prospects were admirable, and then in a single night\r\nwhole districts were blighted.\r\n\r\nThis is how Mr. Steuart Trench described the catastrophe:--\r\n\r\n'On August 1, 1846, I was startled by a sudden and strange rumour that\r\nall the potato fields in the district were blighted, and that a stench\r\nhad arisen emanating from their decaying stalk. The report was true, the\r\nstalks being withered; and a new, strange stench was to be noticed which\r\nbecame a well-known feature in 'the blight' for years after. On being\r\ndug up it was found that the potato was rapidly blackening and melting\r\naway. The stench generally was the first indication, the withered leaf\r\nfollowing in a day or two.'\r\n\r\nThe terrible sufferings which ensued were complicated by some blunders\r\nof British statesmen.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Sir Robert Peel was Prime Minister. He imported Indian meal, and\r\nestablished depots in the country, where it was sold to the people at\r\nthe lowest possible price, thus putting a complete check on private\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Lord John Russell was Premier. He declined to follow the example\r\nof Sir Robert Peel, because he considered that it interfered with Free\r\nTrade, and, reversing the policy of his predecessor, announced that he\r\nleft the importation of meal to private enterprise.\r\n\r\nBut capitalists having been alarmed, meal was not imported in sufficient\r\nquantities, with the result that Indian corn rose to eighteen pounds a\r\nton, when it might have been laid in at the rate of eight pounds a ton.\r\n\r\nHad Lord John Russell's policy come first, and that of Sir Robert Peel\r\nsubsequently, the result would have been very different.\r\n\r\nThe fight over the Corn Law question in England at the time was\r\ndecidedly an injury to Ireland, because the Protectionists minimised the\r\ndanger of famine in the winter of 1845 for fear of the calamity being\r\nmade a pretext for Free Trade.\r\n\r\nDealing with an unforeseen calamity of such stupendous magnitude at long\r\nrange from Downing Street entailed delay; and public relief, waiting\r\nuntil official investigation had tardily reported the hardships,\r\nsuffered in the truly distressful country.\r\n\r\nThe state of things round Bantry, of which I had accurate knowledge, was\r\nappalling. I knew of twenty-three deaths in the poorhouse in twenty-four\r\nhours. Again, on a relief road, two hours after I had passed, on my ride\r\nhome I saw three of the poor fellows stretched corpses on the stones\r\nthey had been breaking.\r\n\r\nThe Registrar-General for Ireland, Mr. William Donelly, officially stated\r\nthat five hundred thousand one-roomed cabins had disappeared between the\r\ncensus before the famine and the one after it.\r\n\r\nWhole families used to starve in their cabins without their plight being\r\ndiscovered until the stench of their decaying corpses attracted notice.\r\n\r\nSome superstition also prevented even the children from eating the\r\nmyriads of blackberries which ripened on the bushes.\r\n\r\nDirectly the calamity was comprehended, the English poured money into\r\nthe country with unbounded generosity, but the management was bad.\r\n\r\nThe relief works organised by the Government took the form of draining\r\nand road-making. This entailed delay, owing to the preliminary\r\nsurveying, and when employment could be given, the people were too\r\nemaciated and feeble to work. All over Ireland unfinished roads leading\r\nhalf way to places of no consequence are to-day grass-grown memorials of\r\nthat ghastly effort of State assistance.\r\n\r\nAlmost the earliest of the private soup-kitchens for the relief of the\r\nsufferers was that opened at Dingle under the joint initiative of Lady\r\nVentry, Mrs. Hickson, my future mother-in-law, and Mrs. Hussey, my\r\nmother. So as not to pauperise the people, subscriptions of one penny a\r\nweek were asked from every house in the town. At ten in the morning\r\nthose who wanted it could get a pint per head of really excellent soup\r\nfor themselves and their families. Those who were known to be able to\r\npay had to contribute a penny; the really destitute had gratuitous\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nSo bad was the famine that people coming in from the country fell in the\r\nstreet never to rise again. One woman was found lying on the outskirts\r\nof the town almost dead from starvation, her three children having\r\nsuccumbed beside her, and had she not been carried to the soup-kitchen\r\nshe would not have survived them many hours.\r\n\r\nMy wife well remembers another case. One day her mother emerged from a\r\ncabin carrying what looked like a big bundle of clothes. It was the form\r\nof an emaciated woman, whose four children and husband had all starved.\r\nMy mother-in-law took her to her own house, fed her at first with\r\nspoonsful of soup, and kept her there until she had rebuilt her once\r\nvigorous constitution.\r\n\r\nMy wife subsequently recollects her as a hale, buxom, young widow coming\r\nto say good-bye before emigrating to America.\r\n\r\nVery soon all the coffins had been exhausted, and in many places the\r\ndead were taken to the graves and dropped in through the hinged bottom\r\nof a trap-coffin.\r\n\r\nAfter soup had been introduced, Indian meal stirabout proved\r\nefficacious, and it was distributed from large iron boilers set up by\r\nthe roadside to the gaunt, cadaverous wretches who scuffled for the\r\nsustenance.\r\n\r\nEven more terrible than those privations was the fever which supervened.\r\nApart from the lack of food, a great cause of mortality lay in the\r\nchange of diet. Potatoes form a bulky article of food, and stirabout,\r\nunless very carefully made, used to swell after it was consumed. Many,\r\ntoo, ate raw turnips from sheer destitution, and these also caused\r\nswelling of the stomach as well as a dysentery almost always fatal in a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\nNumbers of starving Catholics had gone to Protestant clergymen and\r\noffered to become converts in return for food, and when some of these\r\nsickened with the fever, the priests declared it was a judgment on them,\r\nand religious hostility became intensified.\r\n\r\nAt Dingle Lady Ventry and her helpers were denounced from the pulpits as\r\n'benevolent sisters bent on superising the poor'--to superise being the\r\nimprovised verb for Protestantising, a thing they decidedly did not\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nA very early instance of the open-air cure never before recorded took\r\nplace at Lismore. When every possible place in the hospital had been\r\nfilled with fever patients, a number had to be lodged in a disused\r\nquarry near the Blackwater, and of the latter not a single sufferer\r\ndied, though the mortality within doors was excessive.\r\n\r\nI remember one rather quaint incident.\r\n\r\nA large amount of sea biscuit was brought into a house for distribution\r\nby a benevolent gentleman. His daughter, aged seven, surreptitiously\r\nstole a biscuit for the purpose of eating it. But at the first attempt\r\nto bite the tough thing, out came a loose tooth. She howled with fright,\r\nthinking it a judgment on her for her misdeed, and went in tears to tell\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\nI have always hoped the latter had enough sense of humour to laugh at\r\nthe incident, but my shrewd suspicion is that she improved the\r\noccasion--an error for which there is always temptation, and on which\r\nthere is often the retribution of the few words having the opposite\r\neffect to that intended.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the landlords during the famine and fever has been much\r\ndiscussed and variously represented. But many of the Nationalists\r\nthemselves have declared that the diatribes of their comrades have been\r\nthoroughly undeserved. Absenteeism apart--for which no excuse need be\r\nattempted--the Irish landlords did their best, gave of their substance,\r\nand imperilled their own lives for the sake of the sufferers. Mr.\r\nRichard White of Inchiclogh, near Bantry, fell a victim to the fever.\r\nTwo other landlords who gave their lives for others were Mr. Richard\r\nMartin, M.P., and Mr. Nolan of Ballinderry. The conditions of tenure did\r\nnot admit of lavish financial generosity, but as one of their sharpest\r\ncritics in later times admitted, the vast majority 'went down with the\r\nship.'\r\n\r\nThe survivors of this terrible time numbered heroes drawn from all\r\nclasses of life; and it would have been well if the lesson of universal\r\ncharity then practically demonstrated had been allowed to sink into all\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nInstead I will quote the following extract from John Mitchel's _History\r\nof Ireland_, a thick, paper-bound volume, which, at the price of\r\neighteenpence, has circulated enormously among the Irish, not only at\r\nhome, but in Glasgow and America.\r\n\r\nOn page 243:--'That million and a half of men, women, and children were\r\ncarefully, prudently, and peacefully _slain_' [the italics are those of\r\nMitchel] 'by the English Government. They died of hunger in the midst of\r\nabundance which their own hands created; and it is quite immaterial to\r\ndistinguish those who perished in the agonies of famine itself from\r\nthose who died by typhus fever, which in Ireland is always caused by\r\nfamine.\r\n\r\n'Further, this was strictly an _artificial_ famine--that is to say, it\r\nwas a famine which desolated a rich and fertile island that produced\r\nevery year abundance and superabundance to sustain all her people and\r\nmany more. The English, indeed, call that famine a dispensation of\r\nProvidence, and ascribe it entirely to the blight of the potatoes. But\r\npotatoes failed in like manner all over Europe, yet there was no famine\r\nsave in Ireland. The British account of the matter, then, is first a\r\nfraud; second, a blasphemy. The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato\r\nblight, but the English created the famine.'\r\n\r\nSuch pestilential perversion of truth is freely circulated and firmly\r\nbelieved, for contradiction never penetrates to those gulled by these\r\nlies. In America the gutter press section of journalism is esteemed at\r\nits true worth, and is as harmless as a few squibs. In Ireland what is\r\nseen in bad print is always believed, and is corroborated by the lower\r\nclass of priest. When I say so much I am simply indicating a national\r\nsore, but it needs a wiser physician than myself to apply a successful\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps with the spread of education may arise the same power to\r\ndiscriminate between the true and false published in the papers that is\r\na characteristic of both the English and Scottish. As it is, the\r\nIrishman believes whatever he reads in print; and in most cases the\r\nsolitary paper that he reads is one full of treason and untruths.\r\n\r\nWhen the famine took place, the Irish fled as from a plague to America,\r\nand when they landed there both men and women were the prey of every\r\nblackguard without a single person to advise or protect them.\r\n\r\nHad the Government taken the movement in hand and employed agents at New\r\nYork to provide for them until they obtained employment, and to direct\r\nthem where to apply for it, England would to-day probably have had a\r\ngrateful nation on the other side of the Atlantic. Instead, we have a\r\nhostile multitude which neglects no opportunity of voting for any\r\npolitician hostile to Great Britain; and this disaffection sadly\r\nmilitates against that union of Anglo-Saxon hearts, which is so freely\r\naccepted by journalists and politicians as a sort of millennium.\r\n\r\nMiss Cobbe related a story about a steady-going girl who had received\r\nmoney from her sister who was doing well in New York to pay her passage\r\nmoney out.\r\n\r\nShe told Miss Cobbe how she had been to an emigration office and booked\r\nher passage.\r\n\r\n'Direct to New York, of course.'\r\n\r\n'Well no, Miss. But to some place close by, New something else.'\r\n\r\n'New something else near New York?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I disremember what it was, but he said it was quite handy for New\r\nYork.'\r\n\r\n'Not New Orleans, surely?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Miss, that was it, New Orleans, quite near New York,' he said.\r\n\r\nThe scoundrelly agent had taken her passage money and sent her off\r\nabsolutely friendless to New Orleans, where she died of a fever in less\r\nthan a year.\r\n\r\nMany of the three million emigrants after the famine must have been as\r\neasily duped.\r\n\r\nA considerable time ago (but if I were in Kerry I could give the date\r\nfrom my diary, because I met the man at a dinner given at the St.\r\nJames's Club by Lord Kenmare's son-in-law, Mr. Douglas) one of the big\r\nNew World railway companies sent over an emissary to the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nHe was charged to offer to take every distressed man in Ireland, with\r\nhis priest--if he would go--piper, cat, wife, sister, mother, and\r\nchildren, to the land through which the great railway ran. Each man was\r\nto be given a log-house with three rooms, one hundred and sixty acres,\r\nten of them under cultivation, and no residence was to be more than ten\r\nmiles from a railway station. All that was asked in return was a loan\r\nfor ten years without interest to cover the expenses of transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI rather think Mr. Chichester Fortescue was the Chief Secretary. Anyhow,\r\nwhoever occupied that post urged the Cabinet to accept the offer. The\r\nconclave wavered, but Mr. Gladstone firmly vetoed the idea. He was\r\nafraid the plan would be unpopular with the priests, who would see\r\nthemselves bereft of the favourite members of their congregations.\r\n\r\nInstead of this admirable scheme, we have ever since had the pitiable\r\nsight of the parents, the sisters, and the sweetheart crooning over the\r\nemigration of the best able-bodied young men from Ireland.\r\n\r\nNo one who has heard the keening and wailing, say at Limerick Junction,\r\nover Paddy going over the water will forget the appealing sorrow of the\r\nscene, the sound of which rings long in one's ears after the train has\r\ngone out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe emigrant has been the theme of song and story. He has also been one\r\nof the finest recruits of the United States, whilst he is a stigma on\r\nEnglish politics, and a drain on the land which in all Europe can least\r\nafford to spare him.\r\n\r\nMr. Wyndham's new Act will not arrest emigration, indeed it will\r\nprobably increase it.\r\n\r\nAt present the landlord is often able to put pressure on his tenants to\r\ngive employment to respectable men. But the small farmer is certain to\r\nuse as few men as possible. You can see the analogy in contemporary\r\nFrance. Therefore more families will see the pride of their cabins\r\nstarting for the New World.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what I am proudest of, was being called in an address in Kerry\r\n'the poor man's friend,' for it is what I have always striven to be.\r\n\r\nBut if I were to be a young man to-morrow, instead of a day older than I\r\nam to-day, I should be powerless to merit such a title in years to come.\r\n\r\nAnd the reason, as I have just indicated, is the fault of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nI sometimes think the canniest man of whom I ever heard was the old\r\nScottish minister who was accustomed to preface his extempore petition\r\nwith the words:--\r\n\r\n'My britheren, let us noo pray that the High Court of Parliament winna\r\ndo ony harm.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFENIANISM\r\n\r\n\r\nI am quite aware the opinion I am about to deliver will cause great\r\nsurprise, but I give it after mature consideration, supported by all my\r\nknowledge of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt is this:--\r\n\r\nThe old Fenianism was politically of little account, socially of no\r\ndanger, except to a few individuals who could be easily protected, and\r\nhas been grossly exaggerated, either wilfully or through ignorance.\r\n\r\nMatters were very different after Mr. Gladstone, by successive acts, of\r\nwhat I maintain were criminal legislation, deliberately fostered treason\r\nand encouraged outrage in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIrish agitation would never have reached genuine importance unless it\r\nhad been steadily assisted in its noisome growth by the so-called Grand\r\nOld Man, at whose grave may be laid every calamity which has affected\r\nIreland since it had the misfortune to arouse his interest, and the ill\r\neffects of whose demoralising interference will bear fruit for many\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\nThis is set down in sober earnest and in as unprejudiced a spirit as it\r\nis possible for any sincerely patriotic--using the word in its true and\r\nnot in its debased meaning--Irishman to feel when he is thoroughly\r\nacquainted with all the niceties of the national history for the past\r\nsixty years.\r\n\r\nI am far from saying that subsequent British cabinets have always\r\nunderstood the Irish questions, but they are at least only reaping the\r\nwhirlwind where Mr. Gladstone sowed the wind.\r\n\r\nI would broadly characterise as Fenian every Irish outbreak or\r\nebullition in the nineteenth century up to the time of the baneful\r\ninfluence of the man who conducted the Midlothian campaign.\r\n\r\nHalf the tumultuous efforts of the earlier movements would have been\r\nrendered ridiculous had it been possible to have them contemporaneously\r\nexamined by a few special correspondents. I can imagine the\r\nrepresentative of the _Daily Mail_ finding material for very few\r\nsensational headlines in the Whiteboys Insurrection.\r\n\r\nAs for the tales of single-handed terrorism, these in Ireland did\r\nnursery duty to alarm imaginative children, just as the adventures of\r\nDick Turpin and Jack Sheppard or the kidnapping of heirs by gipsies\r\nserve as stories to thrill English little ones.\r\n\r\nOf course in 1789 to have killed three Protestants was counted a\r\npassport into heaven in the vicinity of Vinegar Hill. But Father\r\nMatthew's temperance crusade was worth more salvation to the nation, and\r\nmere threatening letters count for nothing. I have had over one hundred\r\nin my time, yet I'll die in my bed for all that.\r\n\r\nMy father-in-law had a pretty solid contempt for the Whiteboys--not the\r\noriginal breed, but those who assumed the title in Kerry early in the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nHe was told that these miscreants had a plan to surround his house that\r\nnight and to shoot everybody in it, and at that very moment they were\r\nconfabulating at a certain farmhouse.\r\n\r\nRefusing to be escorted or guarded, he made his way to that farm, and\r\nwalking into the kitchen, rated the lot of them in unmeasured terms.\r\n\r\nCowed and abashed they listened to him as he threatened the law, hell,\r\nand the devil alone knows what beside. Finally, pistol in hand, he bade\r\nthem produce their arms and put them in his dog-cart.\r\n\r\nThis they actually did--for they had imbibed no liquor to give them\r\nfalse pluck--and, with a final curse, he whipped up his horse and drove\r\naway 'with all their teeth' to the barracks, where he left a very useful\r\narsenal, and was never troubled by one of them again.\r\n\r\nTo thus obtain complete immunity by sheer coolness is as much a matter\r\nof personal magnetism as anything else. An instance of this, which\r\nimpressed me much, occurred in a coiner-ghost story told by Mr. T.P.\r\nO'Connor, which I venture to quote.\r\n\r\n'The hero was no less a person than Marshal Saxe. One night, on the\r\nmarch, he bivouacked in a haunted castle, and slept the sleep of the\r\nbrave until midnight, when he was awakened by hideous howls heralding\r\nthe approach of the spectre. When it appeared, the Marshal first\r\ndischarged his pistol point-blank at it without effect, and then struck\r\nit with his sabre, which was shivered in his hand. The invulnerable\r\nspectre then beckoned the amazed Marshal to follow, and preceded him to\r\na spot where the floor of the gallery suddenly yawned, and they sank\r\ntogether through it to sepulchral depths. Here he was surrounded by a\r\nband of desperate coiners who would forthwith have made away with him if\r\nthe Marshal had not told them who he was, and warned them that if he\r\ndisappeared his army would dig to the earth's centre to find him, and\r\nwould infallibly find and finish every one of them.\r\n\r\n'\"If I am reconducted to my chamber by this steel-clad spectre and\r\nallowed to sleep undisturbed until morning, I promise never to relate\r\nthis adventure while any harm can happen to you by my telling it.\"\r\n\r\n'To this the coiners after consultation agreed. He was led back to bed,\r\nand next morning ridiculed all spectral stories to his officers. It was\r\nnot until the world of coiners was finally broken up that he related his\r\nexperiences.'\r\n\r\nIn that story I wonder who went bail for the Marshal's truth. Veracity\r\nand gallantry may not have gone hand in hand, or perhaps they were\r\naffianced, and therefore took care not to come near one another.\r\n\r\nAnother sort of gallantry was noteworthy in what was known as Young\r\nIreland, for in 'the set' were several ladies, Eva, Mary, and Speranza,\r\nall prone to write seditious verse. Eva was Miss Mary Kelly, daughter of\r\na Galway gentleman, who promised her lover to wait while he underwent\r\nten years penal servitude, and kept her word, marrying him at Kingstown\r\ntwo days after his release. 'Mary' was Miss Ellen Downing, whose lover\r\nwas also a fugitive after the outbreak; but he proved unfaithful, and\r\nshe was one of the last I heard of who died of pining away. It used to\r\nbe much talked of in my young days. Perhaps now that it is not, it more\r\noften occurs. 'Speranza' was Lady Wilde, a fluent poet and essayist, who\r\nsurvived her husband the archæologist. One of her children inherited\r\nmuch of her talent, but bears a chequered fame. I always thought the wit\r\nof Oscar Wilde anything but Irish, and was always glad it possessed no\r\nnational attributes--unless impudence was one.\r\n\r\nAt one of his own first nights in London (I think it was on the occasion\r\nof the production of _An Ideal Husband_ at the Haymarket) he was\r\nsummoned before the curtain by the customary shouts for 'Author,\r\nauthor.'\r\n\r\nHe stood there for a moment amid the cheering, and then, in response to\r\ncries for a speech, calmly took a cigarette case out of his pocket,\r\nselected one of the contents, and, having very deliberately lighted it,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n'Ladies and gentlemen, I do not know what you have done, but I have\r\nspent a very pleasant evening with my own play. Good night.'\r\n\r\nHis brother, known as 'Wuffalo Will' among his friends, is the hero of\r\nmany stories.\r\n\r\nOnce he went up to a policeman and said:--\r\n\r\n'Which is the way to heaven?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know, sir; better ask a parson.'\r\n\r\n'What do you think I pay taxes for? It's your business to be able to\r\ntell me the way to heaven. As for the bally parsons, they don't\r\nunderstand.'\r\n\r\nA broad smile came over the constable's face.\r\n\r\n'Were you asking where you could get blind drunk comfortably, sir?\r\nbecause if so--'\r\n\r\nAnd out came the hint with a wink.\r\n\r\nWilde was fond of that tale at one time.\r\n\r\nThe affair of ''48' was a farce. Stimulated by the French Revolution,\r\nJohn Mitchel wrote rabid sedition, but received short shrift at the\r\nhands of the Government, who arrested him, sentenced him to fourteen\r\nyears' transportation, and almost from the dock he was taken manacled in\r\na police van, escorted by cavalry, and put on board a steamer, which at\r\nonce put out to sea.\r\n\r\nSmith O'Brien was the leader of this feeble insurrection. He had boasted\r\nhe would be at the head of fifty thousand Tipperary men. Instead his\r\narmy consisted of a few hundred half-clad ragamuffins, which attacked a\r\nsquad of police who took refuge in a farmhouse, and easily routed the\r\nrabble.\r\n\r\nSmith O'Brien proved himself an arrant coward. He hid in a cabbage\r\ngarden, and is still believed to have made his temporary escape from the\r\npolice in the habit of an Anglican sisterhood, of which his sister, Hon.\r\nMrs. Monsell, was Mother Superior.\r\n\r\nThe bigger outbreak was not a bit more serious. It was all trumped up by\r\nthe Irish in America, and their reliance upon help from American\r\nsoldiers was destroyed after the war. This agitation was the one known\r\nas the work of the Phoenix Society, and the object was the separation of\r\nIreland from England and the confiscation of Irish property.\r\n\r\nThe leaders were James Stephens, who had nearly escaped being shot by a\r\npoliceman in the Smith O'Brien campaign, and that indomitable scoundrel\r\nO'Donovan Rossa. It was at this time we began to hear of mysterious\r\nstrangers. In this case it was Stephens; later Parnell wrapped himself\r\nin strange isolation; and subsequently Tynan, who was known as 'Number\r\nOne.'\r\n\r\nCork and Kerry were the chosen parts of Ireland for the new Fenianism to\r\ncome to a head, and a certain amount of enrolling and drilling did take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nI was then residing within two miles of the city of Cork, and one night\r\nthe Fenians came out and encamped all round my house, without offering\r\nthe slightest molestation or injury to anybody.\r\n\r\nTwo Fenians walked into the house of my stableman, about a quarter of a\r\nmile from my own, and asked for food, saying they were ready to pay for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe woman replied that she had no food in the house, but the breakfast\r\nof her brother Charles, which she was about to take to him in the\r\nstables.\r\n\r\nThey wanted to pay her a shilling for it, but she declined, and then\r\nthey went away quietly.\r\n\r\nThe principal outbreak was to be in Killarney, and they plotted to\r\nattack the police barrack at Cahirciveen, because they had an ally in\r\nthe son of the head constable.\r\n\r\nBut a man in the town, to whom he had shown kindness, warned the head\r\nconstable of the attack, which in the end consisted of a few shots fired\r\nby a ragged rabble of about three hundred, half of whom were\r\nhalf-hearted, and the other half half-drunk.\r\n\r\nThe coastguards manned their boat and rowed off to a gunboat in the\r\nharbour to ask for some marines; and the moment this was known to the\r\nbesiegers they dispersed. Some of them marched rather downcast towards\r\nKillarney, and on the road they met a mounted policeman riding to warn\r\nCahirciveen of the attack which was to be made against the barracks, for\r\nevery movement of this silly rebellion was known to the Government.\r\n\r\nThey called on the man to stop and deliver up his despatches. He\r\ndeclined to do so, and so soon as he had ridden on they shot him in the\r\nback, wounding him badly.\r\n\r\nHe recovered, but was very shabbily treated by the Government, who only\r\nawarded him a miserably small pension, a niggardly act which aroused\r\nmuch dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Bishop of Killarney, Doctor Moriarty, protested\r\nstrongly against the cowardice of the Fenians, who were afraid to face\r\none armed man, and waited until his back was turned before they shot\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I have indicated, the Fenian movement was very\r\ninsignificant, and was known in all its aspects to the Government, which\r\ndealt pretty roughly with it.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that in the Fenian councils Killarney should have\r\nbeen selected for the outbreak.\r\n\r\nThis is a town where nearly all the landed proprietors were Roman\r\nCatholics, where there was a Catholic Bishop, a monastery and two\r\nconvents, while one half-ruined Protestant church sufficed to\r\naccommodate the few worshippers who sat under a dreary, inoffensive\r\nvicar on a very small salary. All reasonable folk, moreover, know that\r\nKillarney is the town to which, more than any other in Ireland, it is\r\nimportant to attract British tourists.\r\n\r\nIt was well known that some of the promoters and instigators of the\r\nmovement betrayed it before its very inception to the Government; and\r\nBishop Moriarty, from his pulpit, in his sermon alluded in no measured\r\nlanguage to those criminals who instigated the innocent peasants to play\r\na part in this mock insurrection, and then betrayed them.\r\n\r\nHe concluded:--\r\n\r\n'It may be a hard saying, but surely hell is not too hot nor eternity\r\ntoo long for the punishment of such villainy.'\r\n\r\nYet the whole of Irish history is disfigured by the poisonous trail of\r\nthe insidious informer.\r\n\r\nI was in Kerry at the time of the Cahirciveen fizzle, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dingle, and it was rumoured that the insurrection was\r\nto be general.\r\n\r\nThat was not my opinion, for I travelled on an open car by myself, with\r\na large quantity of money, and no other weapon than an umbrella.\r\n\r\nIt was a very different state of affairs in the distress caused by Mr.\r\nGladstone's legislation, for then I never travelled without a revolver,\r\nand occasionally was accompanied by a Winchester rifle. I used to place\r\nmy revolver as regularly beside my fork on the dinner-table, either in\r\nmy own or in anybody else's house, as I spread my napkin on my knees.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is strangely difficult to see any other cause than Mr.\r\nGladstone's Acts for such ill-feeling.\r\n\r\nAs my sworn evidence, on which I was cross-examined in the Parnell\r\nCommission, showed, I had only ten evictions in six years among two\r\nthousand tenants.\r\n\r\nI should like to ask, in what class of life is there not more than one\r\nin twelve hundred that gets into financial troubles in a year?\r\n\r\nIn the insurance world such a ratio of claims to premiums would make a\r\nperfect fortune to the companies.\r\n\r\nThe tenants were not associated with the Fenian movement at all, the\r\noutbreak being solely confined to the townsfolk, which, in Ireland,\r\nhelped to make it a feeble affair. I did not know one _bona fide_ farmer\r\nthat was connected with the movement, and though the arms were mainly\r\nsmuggled in from America, mighty little hard cash came to the pockets of\r\nany but the leaders.\r\n\r\nStephens was the original 'Number One,' and he was let out of Kilmainham\r\nby the chief warder's wife. No one knew where he was to be found, but\r\nthe police, who were well aware that he was devoted to his own wife,\r\nkept a strict watch on her, and eventually caught him through his\r\nopening communications with her.\r\n\r\nWhen the hue and cry was loudest, it was reported he had come to Cork to\r\nfoster the Fenian movement, and that he was disguised in feminine garb.\r\n\r\nOne day my wife found her steps dogged by a man in the most aggravating\r\nway, for he followed her into three shops without attempting to speak to\r\nher, his only desire being to shadow her, which he was doing in the most\r\nclumsy manner.\r\n\r\nI was away at Dingle for the day, so my wife went into the establishment\r\nof the leading linen-draper, and sending for the head of the firm, asked\r\nhim to speak to the man, who was then pretending to buy some tape.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that he was a detective fresh from Dublin, who had taken\r\nit into his head that she was Stephens, and was most apologetic, as well\r\nas crestfallen, at his error.\r\n\r\nSome time after this Fenian fizzle, my coachman saw a number of people\r\nbeing chased by the police for drilling; and about two years later, when\r\nI sent him to the Cork barracks on private business, he told me that he\r\nthere noticed some of the very people who had been routed by the\r\nconstabulary, but this time they were being drilled by the Government as\r\nmilitia.\r\n\r\nI have always had a theory that Ireland was created by Providence for\r\nthe express purpose of bothering philosophers, and preventing them or\r\npoliticians from thinking themselves too wise.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Fenian scare was damaging Killarney as a tourist\r\nresort, Sir Michael Morris--as he then was--was staying at Morley's\r\nHotel in London, and saw in the American paper lying on the table a\r\nvivid account of how the Fenian army had attacked a British garrison,\r\nand would have easily captured the stronghold had not an overpowering\r\nforce of English cavalry and artillery hurried up to deliver the\r\nbesieged.\r\n\r\nOf course, the facts were, that in County Limerick several hundred\r\n'patriots,' led by a man in a green calico uniform, attacked a police\r\nbarrack in which were five constables. Keeping as much out of range of\r\nthe constabulary fire as possible, they had exchanged a few shots when a\r\nDistrict Inspector of Police, who resided some eight miles off, arrived\r\nwith ten constables on a couple of cars, at the sight of which\r\nstupendous relieving force, the whole corps of young Irishmen bolted.\r\n\r\nMorris gave the waiter a shilling for the paper--and took it off his tip\r\nat leaving, no doubt--and carefully treasured the journal until he went\r\nto hold the next assizes at Limerick, when he found the bulk of the\r\nattacking army in the dock before him.\r\n\r\nWhen the D.I. was giving evidence, Morris asked him:--\r\n\r\n'Where were the British cavalry?'\r\n\r\n'What cavalry, my lord? Why, there was none.\r\n\r\n'Oh ho,' says the judge. 'And where was the artillery?'\r\n\r\n'Faith, my lord, there was as much artillery as there was cavalry, and\r\nthat would not get in the way of a donkey race.'\r\n\r\nThen Morris, with appropriate solemnity, proceeded to read out the\r\nnewspaper account for the benefit of the audience. The whole Court was\r\nconvulsed with laughter, in which the prisoners in the dock heartily\r\njoined.\r\n\r\nAfter the trial was over, a parish priest came to congratulate Morris,\r\nand said to him:--\r\n\r\n'My lord, you have laughed Fenianism out of Limerick.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Hussey]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMYSELF, SOME FACTS, AND MANY STORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1850 I became agent to the Colthurst property, which consisted of\r\nmost of the parish of Ballyvourney, one estate alone containing about\r\ntwenty-three thousand acres. The rental was then over £4600. There were\r\nonly three slated houses on the property, hardly any out-buildings, only\r\nseven miles of road under contract, and about twenty acres planted.\r\n\r\nBy 1880 the landlord had expended £30,000 on improvements, there were\r\nover one hundred slated houses, about sixty miles of roads, and over\r\nfour hundred acres planted.\r\n\r\nUnder the Land Act of 1881 the rent was reduced to £3600.\r\n\r\nThat was the encouragement officially given to the landlord for\r\nassisting in the improvement of his property.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Moses downwards, the policy of all Governments has been\r\nto give relief to the debtor. By the Encumbered Estate Act, which was\r\npassed just after the famine, special relief was given to the creditor.\r\n\r\nWhat the English view was may be taken from the _Times_--\r\n\r\n'In a few years more, a Celtic Irishman will be as rare in Connemara as\r\nis the Red Indian on the shores of Manhattan.'\r\n\r\nThat is to say, English capital was at last to flow into Ireland for the\r\npurchase of encumbered estates, but the anticipation of course was\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\nEnglish capital was placed for preference in Turkish and in Egyptian\r\nbonds, to the great loss of all concerned. As for Ireland, out of the\r\nfirst twenty millions realised by the new Court, over seventeen was\r\nIrish money; and at the outset there was an inevitable downward tendency\r\nof prices which involved heavy depreciation.\r\n\r\nCredit was destroyed in Ireland, and every man who owed a shilling was\r\nutterly ruined. Had the Government given loans at a reasonable rate of\r\ninterest, which would have amply repaid them, all this could have been\r\nsaved. As it was, properties were sold like chairs and tables at a\r\npaltry auction, and in thousands of cases the judge expressed himself\r\nsatisfied that the rent could have been considerably increased.\r\n\r\nI knew one unfortunate shopkeeper who paid £6000 for a property under\r\nthese circumstances; and in place of an increase of rent, the\r\nconfiscators--that is to say the commissioners imposed by Mr.\r\nGladstone--took a third of the rental off him.\r\n\r\nThose purchasers who were English conceived when they bought properties\r\nthat they would get as much from them as the solvent tenants were\r\nwilling to pay. The legislation of Mr. Gladstone in coalition with the\r\nblunderbuss soon put an end to the pleasing delusion. It was one more of\r\nthe English mistakes about Ireland, where, when the tenant is content to\r\npay, the British Government and the Land League both combine to prevent\r\nhim from offering a reasonable rent to a landlord.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, even the most seditionary organs confessed that the\r\ntenants gained little and lost much by the change from the old type of\r\nlandlord to the new, for the latter, being practical men, had no\r\nsympathy for the man who was permanently behindhand with his rent. And\r\nno one can say that this habitual arrear was a healthy stimulus to the\r\nmoral wellbeing of the tenant himself, though he felt aggrieved at its\r\nbeing checked.\r\n\r\nThere is not the least need to sketch how I gradually became one of the\r\nlargest land agents in Ireland. It has been published in other books,\r\nand would only prove wearisome if set out in detail in this volume. So I\r\nwill merely observe that only two years after the big Fenian rising, as\r\nit was called--which I should describe as being composed of a rabble of\r\nless importance than the ragamuffins led by Wat Tyler--so little was I\r\nimpressed by its magnitude that I went to live at Edenburn. There I laid\r\nout a lot of money in rebuilding the house, spending over £2000 in\r\nadditions. This was most idiotic of me, because I had not counted on the\r\ninfernal devices of Mr. Gladstone to render Ireland uninhabitable for\r\npeaceful and law-abiding folk.\r\n\r\nWhen I first settled down there, labourers were working at eightpence or\r\ntenpence a day. Now the lowest rate is two shillings. The labourer\r\nrectified this rate by emigration, and if the farmers, who could more\r\nadvantageously have emigrated, had done so, the cry for compulsory\r\nreduction would never have arisen.\r\n\r\nThus far I have dealt with facts and myself as concerned in them, but I\r\npropose now to relate a few stories, a thing more congenial to my\r\ntemperament than any other form of conversational exercise. Whether it\r\nwill equally commend itself to the reader is a matter on which I, as an\r\naged novice in literature, though hopeful, am of course uncertain.\r\n\r\nIndeed I am in exactly the predicament of a farmer's wife who was asked\r\nby the Dowager Lady Godfrey, after a month of marriage, how she liked\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n'I had plenty of recommendation with him,' was the reply, 'but I have\r\nnot had enough trial of him yet to say for sure.'\r\n\r\nThere is a story about a honeymoon couple at Killarney which is worth\r\ntelling.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom had a valet, a good, faithful fellow, long in his\r\nservice, but talkative, a thing his master loathed. He said to him:--\r\n\r\n'John, I've often told you to hold your tongue about my affairs. This\r\ntime I emphatically mean it. If you tell the people in the hotel that I\r\nam on my honeymoon, I'll sack you on the spot.'\r\n\r\nSo John promised to be as silent as the grave, but on the third\r\nafternoon, as the happy pair were ascending the stairs of the Victoria\r\nHotel, they saw by the giggles and smirks of the chambermaids that their\r\nsecret had been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom rang his bell and went for John in a towering passion,\r\nbut the fellow held his ground.\r\n\r\n'Is it not unfair the way you are taking on? Sure the other servants did\r\nask me if you were on your honeymoon, but I was even with them, for I\r\ntold them \"devil a bit, your honour was not going to marry the lady\r\nuntil next month.\"'\r\n\r\nI do not know how that alliance turned out, but the happy pair left the\r\nhotel early next morning.\r\n\r\nI can tell rather more about the matrimonial experiences of an\r\nArchdeacon at Cork, who married firstly a woman who was very fond of\r\nsociety. She died, and he then married another, who grew very stout. She\r\nalso died, and the indefatigable cleric married as his third experiment\r\na widow cursed with a very violent temper.\r\n\r\nHe was one day chaffed on the practical demonstration he had given to\r\nthe Romish doctrine of the celibacy of the Church, when he said:--\r\n\r\n'After all they were a trial, for I married the world, the flesh, and\r\nlastly the devil, and now I tremble whenever I think of recognition in\r\neternity.'\r\n\r\nThis Cork story comes naturally, because at that time I was living near\r\nCork and very happily too.\r\n\r\nNow and again we took trips up to Dublin when I had business there.\r\n\r\nI am not much of a playgoer, but in Dublin we always went to the theatre\r\non the chance of hearing some of the proverbial wit of its gallery.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, a lady in the play, when her lover had had some doubt\r\nof her fidelity, exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n'Would there were a mirror in my side that you could see into my heart.'\r\n\r\nWhereupon a voice from the gods shouted:--\r\n\r\n'Would not a pain [_i.e._ pane] in your stomach do as well. I have one\r\nmyself.'\r\n\r\nLord Chancellor Brady was of a notoriously convivial temperament, which\r\ndid not prevent him being an admirable lawyer when he would allow his\r\nwits to get their heads above water, so to speak, though it was little\r\nenough that he used to dilute his spirits.\r\n\r\nWhen Jenny Lind sang in some Italian opera, he occupied a seat in the\r\nvice-regal box, and gazed at her through a portentously enormous\r\n_lorgnette_.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for a wag in the gallery, who yelled:--\r\n\r\n'Brady, me jewel, I'm glad to see you're fond of a big glass yet.'\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Crimean War, John Reynolds, a very energetic citizen,\r\nwas perpetually raising the question about the dangerous practice of\r\ndriving outside cars from the side instead of the box--in which he was\r\nundoubtedly right.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to the theatre, a gallery boy shouted:--\r\n\r\n'Three cheers for Alderman John Reynolds the hero of Kars.'\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor of the period who sat beside him was a tallow chandler,\r\nand the same spokesman shouted out:--\r\n\r\n'Three cheers for his grease the Lord Mayor just back from the races at\r\nTallagh.'\r\n\r\nThat sort of thing seems to be particularly indigenous, the only\r\nparallel being when undergraduates or medical students get gathered\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe eloquence of Irish members in the House of Commons has really\r\nnothing to do with my reminiscences, but I remember one occasion when it\r\nwas uncommonly well excelled by a stolid Englishman.\r\n\r\nFergus O'Connor--an Irishman, as his name betrays--was an ardent\r\nChartist, and before the Reform Bill was introduced he said in the House\r\nthat he had been accused of being a personal enemy of King William's.\r\nThis was quite untrue, for if there were only good laws he did not care\r\nif the devil were King of England.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel replied:--\r\n\r\n'When the honourable member is gratified by seeing the sovereign of his\r\nchoice on the throne of these realms, I hope he will enjoy, and I am\r\nsure he will deserve, the confidence of the Crown.'\r\n\r\nWhilst I am anecdotal, perhaps I had better say something about books\r\ninto which my stories have been pressed. I was always given to telling\r\ntales, but of course my great time was when Lord Morris and I would sit\r\ntrying to cap one another. If he were ever too idle to remember an\r\nanecdote of his own, he would reel off one of mine: as for his own fund\r\nof stories and humour ever approaching exhaustion, that was not to be\r\nthought of. He was far and away the wittiest man I ever met, and if I do\r\nnot quote one of his tales on this page it is because no single sample\r\ncan show the superb richness of his vintage, and more than one of his\r\nbrand will be found scattered in the present volume.\r\n\r\nI gave a good many anecdotes to my dear old friend Mr. W.R. Le\r\nFanu--cheeriest of fishermen, kindest of jolly good fellows--for his\r\ngarrulous book. He observes in his preface that he makes his first\r\nattempt at writing in his eight-and-seventieth year. I am nearly\r\ntwenty-four months his senior when thus far on the road of these\r\nreminiscences. I also echo another phrase of his:--\r\n\r\n'I trust I have said nothing to hurt the feelings of any of my\r\nfellow-countrymen.'\r\n\r\nJust one quotation--and only a little one--which is not mine, but the\r\nwarning which Sheridan Le Fanu, author of that capital novel _Uncle\r\nSilas_, gave in the _Dublin University Magazine_ against matrimony:--\r\n\r\n'Marriage is like the smallpox. A man may have it mildly, but he\r\ngenerally carries the marks of it with him to his grave.'\r\n\r\nAnd very true too in his division of an Irishman's life into three\r\nparts:--\r\n\r\n'The first is that in which he is plannin' and conthrivin' all sorts of\r\nvillainy and rascality; that is the period of youth and innocence. The\r\nsecond is that in which he is puttin' into practice the villainy and\r\nrascality he contrived before; that is the prime of life or the flower\r\nof manhood. The third and last period is that in which he is makin' his\r\nsoul and preparin' for another world; that is the period of dotage.'\r\n\r\nShakespeare's seven ages of man may have been more poetical, but it does\r\nnot betray a closer grip of the Irish temperament.\r\n\r\nMy other appearance as a literary ghost or rather as an anonymous\r\ncontributor was when I supplied Mrs. O'Connell with stories for _The\r\nLast Count of the Irish Brigade_. That was about twenty years ago, and\r\ntherefore long after the death of the hero who was uncle to the\r\nLiberator.\r\n\r\nThe writer was a daughter of Charles Bianconi, the originator of all the\r\nmail-cars in Ireland, who owned at one time sixteen hundred horses, and\r\nalways laughed at the idea of any violence on the part of the peasantry,\r\npointing out that though his cars daily covered four thousand miles in\r\ntwenty-two counties, no injury was ever done to any of his property.\r\n\r\nMrs. O'Connell was married to a nephew of the great Dan, and he\r\nrepresented Kerry in Parliament for nearly thirty years. He was an\r\nintimate friend of Thackeray's, and gave him all the idioms of his\r\ndelightful Irish ballads. This O'Connell was a clever, amusing fellow,\r\nand precious idle into the bargain.\r\n\r\nI remember one story he told me.\r\n\r\nMrs. MacCarthy, near Millstreet, had a son, a small proprietor, and he\r\ngot married. The mother-in-law lived with the daughter-in-law, who had\r\nrather grand ideas, and set up as parlour-maid in the house a raw lass\r\njust taken from the dairy.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon old Mrs. MacCarthy saw the parish priest coming to call,\r\nand told the girl if he asked for Mrs. MacCarthy to say she was not in\r\nbut the dowager was.\r\n\r\nNow the maid had never heard the word dowager in her life, but thought\r\nshe would make a shot for it, so when his reverence asked if Mrs.\r\nMacCarthy was at home, she blurted out:--\r\n\r\n'No, sir, but the badger is.'\r\n\r\nAnd to her dying day the relic of deceased MacCarthy went by the name of\r\n'the badger.'\r\n\r\nNow it is really time I related how my own beauty was spoilt, by\r\nbreaking my nose in 1858.\r\n\r\nI was racing the present Knight of Kerry and a young gunner named\r\nHickson--no relation--on the Strand, when the horse of the latter\r\ncollided with my own, and they both fell at the same time. He was a\r\nloose rider, and being shot off some distance from his animal picked\r\nhimself up unhurt. I had always a tight grip, so I got entangled in the\r\nsaddle which twisted round, and my mare almost literally tore off my\r\nface with her hind hoof.\r\n\r\nI walked back a quarter of a mile, trying to hold my face on to my head\r\nwith my hand; and in a month's time I was able to get about again, which\r\nthe doctor said was one of the quickest cases of healing he had ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nBut I was absolutely unrecognised by my acquaintances when I reappeared,\r\nand Mr. Dillon the R.M. actually took me for a walk in Tralee to see the\r\ntown, thinking I was a stranger, a situation the fun of which I heartily\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nBefore that infernal gallop I had a hooked nose like the Duke of\r\nWellington; and it's lucky I got married when I did, for no one would\r\nhave had me afterwards, though my own wife always says 'for shame' if I\r\nmake the remark in her presence, God bless her.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to the Abbey of St. Denis, near Paris, I told the verger I\r\nwas very anxious to see the likeness of the saint who had walked for six\r\nmiles with his head in his hand, because I was the nearest living\r\ncounterpart, having walked a quarter of a mile with my face in mine.\r\n\r\nHickson was universally congratulated on his lucky escape. He went out\r\nto India and was dead in eighteen months, and here am I at eighty with\r\nhalf my face and some of my health still in spite of the attentive care\r\nof my family and the doctor.\r\n\r\nMy present doctor is a capital fellow, and when he comes to see me he\r\nlaughs so much at my stories that I always think he ought to take me\r\nhalf price. Instead of that he regards me as an animated laboratory for\r\nhis interesting chemical experiments; but I had the best of him last\r\ntime I was laid up, for I made him take a dose of the filthy compound he\r\nhad ordered for me the previous day.\r\n\r\nFirst he said he wouldn't, then he said he couldn't, but I said what was\r\nnot poison for the patient could not hurt the physician; and in the end\r\nhe had to swallow the dose, making far more fuss over its nasty taste\r\nthan I did. But I noted that he at once wrote me a new prescription,\r\nwhich was as sweet as any advertised syrup, and further, that he\r\narranged his next visit should be just after I finished the bottle.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is years and years after the time of which I am treating.\r\n\r\nYet I am tempted to anticipate, because the mention of Edenburn earlier\r\nin this chapter suggests a quaint individual about whom a few\r\nobservations may be made.\r\n\r\nBill Hogan was our factotum. He was stable-boy, steward, ladies'-maid,\r\nand professional busybody, as well as a bit of a character, though he\r\npossessed none worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nWhen we were packing up to leave Edenburn, my wife was watching him fill\r\ntwo casks, one with home-made jam, the other with china.\r\n\r\nCalled away to luncheon, she found on her return both casks securely\r\nnailed down.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you should not have done that, Bill,' she said, 'for now we shan't\r\nknow which contains which.'\r\n\r\n'I thought of that, ma'am,' replies Bill, 'so I have written S for\r\nchiney on the one, and G for jam on the other.'\r\n\r\nBill's orthography was obviously original.\r\n\r\nSo was the drive he took with a certain cheery guest of mine one Sabbath\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe said guest desired more refreshment than he was likely to get at\r\nthat early hour at Edenburn, so he drove into Tralee, ostensibly to\r\nchurch, and told Bill to have the car round at the club at one.\r\n\r\n'Well,' narrated Bill afterwards, 'out came the Captain from the club,\r\nhaving a few drinks taken, and up he got on the car with my help, but at\r\nthe corner of Denny Street he pulled up at the whisky store, and said we\r\nmust drink the luck of the road. Well we drank the luck at every house\r\non the way out of the town, and presently in the road down came the\r\nmare, pitching the Captain over the hedge, and marking her own knees, as\r\nwell as breaking the shaft. At last we all got home somehow, and there\r\nin the yard was the master, looking us all three up and down as though\r\nhe were going to commit us all from the Bench. Then a twinkle came into\r\nhis eye, and he said as mild as a dove to the Captain, \"I see by the\r\nlook of her knees you've been taking the mare to say her prayers.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE HARENC ESTATE\r\n\r\n\r\nSo large a part has the purchase of this estate made in my more public\r\nappearances, owing to the fact that I have been brought into general\r\nnotice through offensive legal proceedings, that a brief account of the\r\nmatter must form part of my reminiscences.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1878, a gentleman named Harenc, the owner of a large extent of\r\nlanded property in the north of Kerry, died.\r\n\r\nWho the estate subsequently belonged to I am uncertain. Anyhow,\r\naccording to the title-deeds, it was somehow divided among ten or twelve\r\nindividuals before the property came into the Land Estate Courts for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance suggested to a large number of the tenantry that it\r\nmight be an opportunity to avail themselves of the provisions of the\r\nBright Clauses, and become pretty cheaply the owners of the land on\r\nwhich they lived.\r\n\r\nAfter they had offered the sum of £75,000 for the estate, for the\r\npurpose of splitting it up into small holdings, it was found that the\r\ntrustee had privately agreed to sell it to Mr. Goodman Gentleman, the\r\nagent for the late Mr. Harenc, for £65,000.\r\n\r\nThe tenants were not going to be frustrated by that--being Irishmen and\r\nlitigious, which is one and the same thing. So they appealed to the\r\nLanded Estates Court, and induced Judge Ormsby to make an order\r\nannulling the deed of sale, and directing that the property should be\r\nput up in lots suitable to the purposes of the tenants.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the tenants who did not want the property split up approached\r\nme to suggest I should buy the property, and appeared by counsel--the\r\npresent Judge Johnson--in support of me.\r\n\r\nI met the tenants, and stated that if it fell to me I would give each of\r\nthem a lease of thirty-one years, and indemnify myself for the\r\npurchase-money by a rise on the entire rental of five per cent, on the\r\nvaluation of each estate, according to current estimates, at which they\r\nshowed every sign of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI then offered £80,000 for the whole estate, and was declared the\r\npurchaser. A large bonfire was lighted on February 20th, 1878, by the\r\ntenants at Aghabey, near Luxnow, on their being apprised I had become\r\ntheir landlord.\r\n\r\nAnother section of tenants, however, were anxious that the property\r\nshould be bought by Messrs. Lombard and Murphy, private individuals I\r\nnever met.\r\n\r\nThe judge of the Landed Estate Court, Judge Ormsby, gave them the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nI appealed against this decision, and the Court of Appeal unanimously\r\nreversed the verdict of Judge Ormsby, the three judges being the Lord\r\nChancellor of Ireland, the Master of the Rolls--who said it was one of\r\nthe most important cases decided since the foundation of the Land\r\nCourt--and Lord Justice Deasy. I have been told on most excellent\r\nauthority that Lord Justice Christian declined to sit because, as he\r\ntold the Lord Chancellor, he felt so strongly in my favour that he could\r\nnot hear the case with an unbiassed mind.\r\n\r\nThere had been a demonstration at the previous decision, but it paled\r\nbefore the great rejoicings over my success among all the tenantry over\r\nwhom I was agent. There were more than fifty bonfires blazing that night\r\nin Kerry, so that the county looked as though it were signalling the\r\nadvent of another Armada, as in the fragment Macaulay left. The only\r\nplace where any opposition was exhibited was in Castleisland, whence the\r\nLombard family originally sprang; and there the lighted tar-barrels,\r\nwhich had been placed on the ruins of the old castle, were extinguished,\r\nto avoid unpleasant contact with a gang of rowdy roughs.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Lombard and Murphy had stated that they were buying on behalf of\r\nthe tenants. So I served them with notice that if they undertook to sell\r\nto every tenant his own holding they might have the property.\r\n\r\nThis they very wisely declined, and left me in the position that in 1879\r\nI finally purchased a property on what was called an indefeasible\r\nParliamentary title, under the approval of Her Majesty's Judges, and in\r\n1881 an Act of Parliament practically took one-third of it from me.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 I wrote a letter to Mr. Gladstone, asking him to take my\r\nproperty and give me back my money.\r\n\r\nTo this he returned an evasive answer, declining my offer.\r\n\r\nIf the tenants had themselves bought the Harenc property at that time\r\nthey would by this time all be paupers, for they could only get\r\ntwo-thirds of the money from Government, and would have had to borrow\r\nthe other third at a heavy rate of interest.\r\n\r\nOne man, Mr. Hewson, bought one of the farms for £13,500, and under Mr.\r\nGerald Balfour's Act of 1896 it was compulsorily sold to the tenants for\r\nabout £6000. I have the exact figures at Tralee, but these are\r\napproximate enough for the purpose of demonstration.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the other tenants took me into Court.\r\n\r\nI had a piece of reclaimable ground on my own hands which I let for\r\neight shillings an acre. The adjoining tenant, with exactly the same\r\nnature of land--which he swore on oath he had paid more than the\r\nfee-simple in improving--had his rent fixed by the County Court at four\r\nshillings an acre.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, if the County Court valuer had not done so, he would have\r\nquickly lost his employment. The position is one incompatible with\r\nhonesty, and the value of land, apart from what you can get for it, is a\r\nvery disputable matter.\r\n\r\nMy relations with my Harenc tenantry were always good.\r\n\r\nAfter the purchase in 1879 I had no trouble with them, and on the\r\ncontrary received the warmest thanks from the parish priest for my\r\nconduct as a landlord.\r\n\r\nI drained soil and imported seed potatoes, besides executing other\r\nimprovements. The estate was not in good order when I purchased it, and\r\nI know from other sources that the tenants were well satisfied with me.\r\n\r\nI may as well mention, that having no agencies on the Listowel side of\r\nKerry, I was never on the Harenc property before the question of\r\npurchasing arose, and it had on it no house in which I and my family\r\ncould reside.\r\n\r\nUntil 1881 no tenant made any hostile move, but one fellow, who took me\r\ninto the Land Court after the Land Act, presented a very curious case.\r\n\r\nThis man, whose rent was sixty-five pounds a year, applied to the Court\r\nfor reduction. There was a press of business at the time which\r\nnecessitated an adjournment, but in the end the Court fixed the new rent\r\nat the same amount as the old rent.\r\n\r\nThe tenant appealed; but though the Appeal Court valuers attested that\r\nit was worth seventy-five pounds a year, still the rent was unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Government sold me a farm and parliamentary title at\r\nsixty-five pounds a year which one set of Commissioners thought fair and\r\nthe other thought cheap, and yet I had to spend more than half a year's\r\nrent in defending my title to it.\r\n\r\nThere is no appeal as to value, except to the head Commissioners. They\r\nappoint two other Sub-Commissioners to inspect the land, and they of\r\ncourse avoid disagreeing with their brethren.\r\n\r\nIt is very like Mr. Spenlow in _David Copperfield_, who said, 'If you\r\nare not satisfied with Doctors' Commons you can go to the delegates,'\r\nand being asked who the delegates were, he replied that they came from\r\nDoctors' Commons.\r\n\r\nI bought the Harenc property as a speculation, and it turned out a\r\nconfoundedly bad one.\r\n\r\nOnce I had a conversation with a Land Leaguer on the subject. He said:--\r\n\r\n'You bought a stolen horse, and must take the consequences.'\r\n\r\n'If that were so,' I retorted, 'I would have an action against the\r\nGovernment which sold me the horse.'\r\n\r\nI had a correspondence on the subject with Mr. Chamberlain, which\r\nelicited some remarkable letters; but as he marked all of his private\r\nand confidential, they of course cannot be published.\r\n\r\nNow for a few anecdotes, just to show that I have not exhausted my\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nIt would be cruel to specify the individual of whom I can truthfully\r\nsay, he was the biggest fool that ever disfigured the Irish bench.\r\n\r\nHe had been tutor to the children of a great peer, and his patron\r\nsubsequently pressed the Prime Minister to do something for him.\r\n\r\n'I can't make him a County Court judge,' said the Prime Minister, 'for\r\nhe would never decide rightly.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said another Minister, 'we are going out, and have not the ghost\r\nof a chance of ever getting in again in our time. Let him be\r\nSolicitor-General for Ireland during the last weeks we hold office.'\r\n\r\nSo this was done out of sheer good-nature; but after the election the\r\nGovernment found themselves saddled with him, for in those days holders\r\nof high office were not shelved at the caprice of Premiers, whilst the\r\ncountry had unexpectedly returned the old gang to power.\r\n\r\nIt has always been averred by the Irish Bar that an office was specially\r\ncreated for the purpose of shunting this legal luminary into it, but as\r\nan historical fact I will not vouch for the truth of the sarcasm. The\r\naccount of the Cabinet conclave came to me on excellent authority.\r\n\r\nWhen Chief Justice Monaghan died, Lord Morris, who was then a Puisne\r\nJudge of Common Pleas, observed that he himself had a good chance of the\r\npost.\r\n\r\n'What about Keagh and Lawson?' asked his acquaintance, they being\r\nbrother judges.\r\n\r\n'Very good men,' replied Lord Morris, 'but as they were not appointed by\r\nthe Tories, I don't think they'll promote them.'\r\n\r\n'And how about Ormsby?' continued the other.\r\n\r\n'Ah now,' said Morris, 'you are getting sarcastic.'\r\n\r\nThere is a cheery story about Judge Keagh, who has just been mentioned.\r\n\r\nA number of brothers were before him, charged with killing a man at\r\nListowel.\r\n\r\nThe judge was most anxious to ascertain from an important witness what\r\nshare each of the accused had in the murder.\r\n\r\n'What did John do?'\r\n\r\n'He struck him with his stick on the head.'\r\n\r\n'And James?'\r\n\r\n'James hit him with his fist on the jaw.'\r\n\r\n'And Philip?'\r\n\r\n'Philip tried to get him down and kick him.'\r\n\r\n'And Timothy?'\r\n\r\n'He could do nothing, my lord, but he was just walking round searching\r\nfor a vacancy.'\r\n\r\nWhich reminds me that fair play is not always recognised as essential in\r\nthese matters, as the following anecdote shows.\r\n\r\nThere was a faction feud between the Kellehers and Leehys near Sneem.\r\n\r\nOne of the Leehys had a bad leg, and was therefore bound apprentice to a\r\nshoemaker in Sneem.\r\n\r\nOn a fair day a solitary Kelleher ventured into the town, and very\r\nspeedily the Leehys had half-killed and beaten him as well as their\r\nnumbers would allow.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a shout, and the poor lame Leehy came hobbling down\r\nthe street as fast as his wooden leg would permit.\r\n\r\n'Boys, for the love of mercy,' says he, 'let a poor cripple have one go\r\nat the black-hearted varmint.'\r\n\r\nOne of the counsel engaged in the Harenc case was Mr. Murphy, who was a\r\nnear relative of Judge Keagh, and he was a man of ready wit into the\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nThere was a company promoter from London, who had induced several people\r\nto take shares in a bogus concern, and was consequently defendant in an\r\naction brought against him in Cork.\r\n\r\nHe thought he would make an impression on the wild Irish by being\r\noverdressed and gorgeously bejewelled.\r\n\r\nWhen Murphy arose to address the jury, he said:--\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen of the jury, look at the well-tailored impostor without a rag\r\nof honesty to take the gloss off his new clothes.'\r\n\r\nAnother counsel in the case was Mr. Byrne. He was always in impecunious\r\ncircumstances despite his legal eloquence, but the lack of a balance at\r\nhis banker's never troubled him.\r\n\r\nOnce he took Chief Justice Whiteside to see his new house in Dublin,\r\nwhich he had furnished in sumptuous style.\r\n\r\n'Don't you think I deserve great credit for this?' he asked at length.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' retorted Whiteside, 'and you appear to have got it.'\r\n\r\nLord Justice Christian, who had declined to sit on the Appeal, was\r\nconsidered one of the soundest opinions in Ireland. When he ceased to be\r\nsole Judge of Appeal, he had addressed the Bar after this fashion:--\r\n\r\n'As this is the last time I sit as sole Judge of Appeal, it is an\r\nopportune time for me to review my decisions. By a curious coincidence,\r\nI have been thirteen years in this Court, and I have decided thirteen\r\ncases which have been taken to the House of Lords. Eleven of my\r\ndecisions were confirmed, one appeal was withdrawn, and the last was a\r\npurely equity case. The two equity lords went with me, the two common\r\nlaw lords were against me, and when I inform the Bar that my judgment\r\nwas reversed on the casting vote of Lord O'Hagan, I do not think they\r\nwill attach much importance to the decision.'\r\n\r\nJudge Christian's allusion to the Land Act is most noteworthy, for he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n'The property of the country is confided to the discretion of certain\r\nroving commissioners without any fixed rules to guide and direct them.\r\nIn fact, we have reverted to the primitive state of society, where men\r\nmake and administer the laws in the same breath.'\r\n\r\nReverting to the Harenc estate, a rather amusing account was once\r\nperpetrated by a Special Commissioner.\r\n\r\n'Never heard tell of Ballybunion?' said his carman to the journalist as\r\non the road they met the carts laden with sand and seaweed from that\r\nplace. 'Why it's a great place intirely in the season, when quality from\r\nall parts come for the sea-bathing.'\r\n\r\nAs he evidently regarded it as the first watering-place in the world,\r\nthe Special Commissioner thought he had better see the place, and here\r\nis his description:--\r\n\r\n'A village perched on the summit of a cliff, an ancient castle of the\r\nFitz-Maurice clan, wonderful caves, and a little hotel are the leading\r\nfeatures of the place.\r\n\r\n'The morning after my arrival, I experienced a wish to see the cliffs\r\nand caves, and no sooner were the words spoken than a figure bearing an\r\nunlit torch appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n'It was Beal-bo (which may be translated into a somewhat Sioux\r\ncognomen--the Yellow Cow). A figure in rags with an inimitable limp, and\r\na fashion of closing one eye that reminds one of Victor Hugo's Quasimodo\r\nof Notre Dame. A more intimate acquaintance proved there was much\r\ninstruction, and a good deal of amusement, to be derived from this\r\nstrange character.\r\n\r\n'The grand cave is Beal-bo's special source of revenue. He regards it as\r\nhis own property, and takes a pride in it accordingly. This is the\r\ntheatre of the many wiles he practises upon unsuspecting strangers. When\r\nhe has lured them into the bowels of the cave, he turns down a gallery,\r\nand informs them that they cannot get out unless they cross a pool about\r\nfive feet wide. When he has his victim upon his back, he seizes the\r\nopportunity to levy blackmail, for the pool is a quicksand and he\r\nsuddenly affects great fear. After he has sunk to the knees in the\r\nyielding sand, the tourist is glad enough to give him a shilling to\r\nhurry across.\r\n\r\n'In another gallery it is necessary for the stranger to cross a pool on\r\na plank which Beal-bo provides for the occasion, and on this he charges\r\na toll. He used to let the water in to deepen the pools before the\r\ntourists came through, in order to bring his plank into requisition.\r\n\r\n'Suspended on a cliff between heaven and sea, one hundred feet above the\r\nwater, on all sides were piled the immense masses of masonry, the ruins\r\nof which are all that remains of the once proud Castle of Doon. Gazing\r\nin awe down the horrid depths of the \"Puffing Hole,\" Beal-bo informed\r\nus:--\r\n\r\n'\"Twas there Brian used to sleep in the day, and come out at night to\r\nmilk the cows up in the Killarney hills, he and his dog.\"'\r\n\r\nThe Special Commissioner looked incredulous, but Beal-bo was\r\nconfident:--\r\n\r\n'\"May I never be saved, sir, if I haven't seen him meself, many a night,\r\nsir, as he climbed the cliffs backwards to rob the hawks' nests.\"'\r\n\r\nHow can even a Special Commissioner dispute an eyewitness?\r\n\r\nStill the knowledge that I own a harbour of refuge for Brian will hardly\r\nrepay me for all the expense and anxiety the Harenc property has caused\r\nme.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject, I can conclude with a more gratifying fact.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Tralee election, when I stood as a Conservative, a\r\nsmall clique of mob orators and amateur politicians tried to make\r\npolitical capital out of the history of the Harenc estate, and a priest,\r\nFather M. O'Connor, rode the jaded topic to death. The unkindest cut of\r\nall to him was the direct contradiction by the tenants themselves of\r\nevery assertion that their self-constituted champions made on their\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\n'We, the tenants of the Harenc estate, think it our duty to state that\r\nsince Mr. S.M. Hussey became purchaser of the above estate, he has in\r\nevery respect treated us kindly. He was good enough to give us seed\r\npotatoes for half the price they cost himself; he also drained our\r\nportions of the land at two and a half per cent., employed all the\r\nlabourers, and paid them good wages while so employed by him. As a\r\nlandlord we find him liberal and generous.'\r\n\r\nTo this were appended fifty signatures, and the best part of all is that\r\nthe whole of the manifesto was absolutely unsolicited by me, proving an\r\nunexpected source of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nKERRY ELECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn election in most places is an occasion for breaking heads, abusing\r\nopponents, and other similar demonstrations of ardent local\r\nphilanthropy. Such opportunities are never lost by Kerry men, whose\r\nheads are harder and whose wits are sharper than those of the average\r\nrun of humanity. If you are a real Kerry man of respectable convictions,\r\nand self-respecting into the bargain, you will never let the man who is\r\ndrinking with you entertain any opinions but your own at election times.\r\nIf he contradicts you, it's up with your stick and a crack on his skull,\r\nand as that only tickles him up--having much the effect of a nettle\r\nunder a donkey's tail--you then go outside and mutually destroy as much\r\nof each other as can be effected in a fight. Some weeks later, when the\r\nvanquished is able to crawl away from the dispensary doctor, and so save\r\nhis own life amid the dire forebodings of that physician, who refuses to\r\nanswer for the consequences, you begin to drink with him again just to\r\nshow there is no ill-feeling; which of course there is not, if you and\r\nhe are both real Kerry men. Naturally, if you get a sullen, revengeful,\r\ncalculating Protestant from the North, it's another matter, for he'll be\r\nfar too friendly with the constabulary and won't hold with the good old\r\nlocal ways approved by every Kerry Papist and tolerated by most of the\r\npriests.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 there was a Kerry election. A Protestant candidate stood, and so\r\ndid one who in those days was a Whig. I went stoutly for the\r\nProtectionist, but the priests plumped for the Free Trader, and their\r\ncongregations have been regretting it ever since.\r\n\r\nOne tenant was driving in a gig with me to the poll when a priest passed\r\nme on the road and said to my tenant:--\r\n\r\n'May the blast of the Almighty be upon you, for I know you are being\r\ntaken to vote the wrong way.'\r\n\r\nThe tenant got very nervous, for in those times it was generally\r\nbelieved that the priests had power to change men into frogs and toads,\r\na superstition by no means obsolete even now in lone districts. However,\r\nI took him along very easily, giving him the benefit of the roll of my\r\ntongue as to what he should do, and before he reached the polling-booth\r\nhe recovered and voted for the Tory.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Scully from Tipperary was the Whig candidate, and the family was\r\nnot popular in its own county.\r\n\r\nA Cork man, making inquiries of a Tipperary man about him, was\r\nanswered:--\r\n\r\n'I don't know this gentleman personally, but I believe we have already\r\nshot the best of the family.'\r\n\r\nMr. Scully was a very amusing man, and in the House of Commons he used\r\nto go by the nickname of 'old Skull.'\r\n\r\nLord Monk accosted him by this name one night, and Mr. Scully replied:--\r\n\r\n'If you have taken the \"e y\" off your own name, my lord, it is no reason\r\nyou should do it off mine.'\r\n\r\nHere is another story of him.\r\n\r\nMr. Dillwyn said to him, a Roman Catholic:--'I have lived sixty years in\r\nthis world, and I don't yet know the difference between the two\r\nreligions.'\r\n\r\n'Bydad,' retorted Scully, 'you will not have been five minutes in the\r\nother without finding it out.'\r\n\r\nShortly after the franchise was enlarged--which threw Imperial\r\nParliament at the mercy of the ignorant--old Lord Kenmare died and the\r\npresent peer was called up to the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nLord Kenmare was the most popular landlord in Kerry, and he selected a\r\nRoman Catholic cousin of his, Mr. Dease, to stand for the county, Mr.\r\nRoland Blennerhasset, a young Protestant landlord, being started against\r\nhim in support of Home Rule principles.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic bishop and most of the priests backed Mr. Dease, but\r\nthe Home Rule candidate beat him by three to one. Some of the priests,\r\nwho were very obnoxious to the people, supported Mr. Blennerhasset, and\r\nwere then idolised, whilst a very popular parish priest, who canvassed\r\nfor Mr. Dease, had to run for his life.\r\n\r\nFrom thenceforth no one but a Home Rule candidate had any chance in\r\nMunster, and Mr. Roland Blennerhasset, having seen the error of his\r\nways, afterwards became a Unionist candidate in England. He is a very\r\nclever man, who was quite young then, but has now blossomed into a K.C.\r\nin London, and is mighty shrewd about speculations.\r\n\r\nThe election was great fun except for the stones and bricks, of which\r\nenough were thrown about to build a city without foundations. Mr. Dease\r\ngot a blow on his ribs at Castle Island, which told on his health, and\r\nhe died soon afterwards. He was a brother of Sir Gerald Dease, and a man\r\nvery much liked.\r\n\r\nIt was during this election that I was fired at one night at Aghadoe,\r\nreturning from Puck Fair at Killorghin. A rumour was started that it was\r\nthe work of one of the tenants on Sir George Colthurst's Cork estates,\r\nand the Tralee correspondent of the _Examiner_ telegraphed his belief in\r\nthis, adding 'so repugnant are Kerry men to these dastardly outrages.'\r\n\r\nThey took to them as greedily as a duck to water in later times, as all\r\nthe world knows; and in the light of subsequent events it is delightful\r\nto remember that the _Freeman_ stated, 'All condemn this dastardly act,\r\nfor Mr. Hussey is universally respected.'\r\n\r\nIt atoned for this lapse into truth by subsequently taking my name in\r\nvain hundreds of times in the bad periods that were ahead.\r\n\r\nThere had been a libel case between the Rev. Denis O'Donoghue, parish\r\npriest of Ardfert, and myself. The address of this cleric in proposing\r\nMr. Blennerhasset at the nomination had annoyed those he assailed\r\nintensely. Up to that point I had been utterly indifferent, but after\r\nthat I strained every nerve to defeat Father O'Donoghue's nominee.\r\n\r\nThis is an extract from his speech at Ardfert:--\r\n\r\n'Sam Hussey is a vulture with a broken beak, and he laid his voracious\r\ntalons on the consciences of the voters. (Boos.) The ugly scowl of Sam\r\nHussey came down upon them. He wanted to try the influence of his dark\r\nnature on the poor people. (Groans). Where was the legitimate influence\r\nof such a man? Was it in the white terror he diffused? Was it not the\r\nespionage, the network of spies with which he surrounded his lands? He\r\ndenied that a man who managed property had for that reason a shadow of a\r\nshade of influence to justify him in asking a tenant for his vote. What\r\nhad they to thank him for?'\r\n\r\nA voice: 'Rack rents.'\r\n\r\n'They knew the man from his boyhood, from his _gossoonhood_. He knew\r\nhim when he began with a _collop_ of sheep as his property in the world.\r\n(Laughter.) Long before he got God's mark on him. It was not the man's\r\nfault but his misfortune that he got no education. (Laughter.) He had in\r\nthat parish schoolmasters who could teach him grammar for the next ten\r\nyears. The man was in fact a Uriah Heep among Kerry landlords.\r\n(Cheers.)'\r\n\r\nThe result of this and other incentives to irritability was that the\r\nvoters for Mr. Dease had to be escorted by troops and constabulary.\r\n\r\nThe sporting proclivities had already been shown over a race. In the\r\nCounty Club at Tralee there was an altercation between Mr. Sandes and a\r\nleading 'Deasite' as to the rival merits of a bay mare belonging to one\r\nand a chestnut horse owned by the other.\r\n\r\nQuoth Mr. Sandes:--\r\n\r\n'I'll run you a two mile steeplechase for a hundred guineas if you like,\r\nand I'll call my horse Home Rule--do you call yours Deasite; each to\r\nride his own horse.'\r\n\r\nNo Kerry man could refuse such a challenge, and the race excited more\r\ninterest than the election.\r\n\r\nMr. Sandes won, leaving 'Deasite' nowhere, and this helped Mr.\r\nBlennerhasset to head the poll.\r\n\r\nMore than one man is asserted to have voted for:--'Him you know that me\r\nlandlord wants me to vote for.'\r\n\r\nBut I should say several dozen voted for:--\r\n\r\n'Him you know that the priest, God bless him, tells me to vote for.'\r\n\r\nThe libel over which the action arose was alleged to have been published\r\nin the _Cork Examiner_, and the words complained of were pretty sturdy.\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict of one farthing for the plaintiff priest,\r\nand I do not think he derived as much advertisement out of it as Miss\r\nMarie Corelli obtained from a similar coin of the realm.\r\n\r\nOf course all this should have shown me that I had in my own interests\r\nbetter keep clear of Kerry politics, but after I had bought the Harenc\r\nestate, I stood for Tralee as a Tory against The O'Donoghue, who was a\r\nNationalist. I never supposed I was going to get in, but I really had a\r\ncapital run for the Parliamentary Handicap, though I was weighted by\r\npolitical convictions and penalised by my creed. The priests made a most\r\nactive set against me. There were only fifty Protestants on the\r\nregister, and yet I managed to get one hundred and thirty votes, for\r\nwhich suffrages some eighty honest men must have been well worrited in\r\nthe confessional.\r\n\r\nThe O'Donoghue polled one hundred and eighty votes, and I believe a good\r\nmany of his supporters had strong views on the currency question, and he\r\nwas backed by a wealthy merchant. The constituency is now merged into\r\nthe county, and the remotest chance of returning a rational member is\r\nnow at an end.\r\n\r\nThe O'Donoghue did not stand after the merging of the constituency,\r\nthough he was well used to electioneering work and had fought me very\r\npleasantly, with as much devil about him as would make an angel\r\npalatable.\r\n\r\nI did not much care for the whole thing. Still I was always a bit of a\r\nstormy petrel rejoicing in a gale, and my capacity has not waned even in\r\nmy eightieth year.\r\n\r\nThe mob indulged in some lively work. A good many windows of houses\r\nbelonging to my supporters were broken and a man stabbed.\r\n\r\nThe polling day was made the occasion of a public holiday, which meant\r\nthat the bulk of the population was imbibing a great deal more than was\r\ncompatible with the laws of equilibrium. Some amusement was caused by\r\nthe panic of The O'Donoghue's supporters at the votes I was getting, and\r\npresently they brought up in cars one poor man in an advanced stage of\r\nconsumption, and another unable to walk from old age.\r\n\r\nIt was a wearisome day to me; but before its close it became abundantly\r\nevident that if the electors were allowed to exercise a free discretion\r\nand vote according to their consciences, I should have headed the poll\r\nby a large majority. However in Ireland man proposes and the priest\r\ndisposes.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Conservative electors in Cork, Mr. Standford read a\r\ntelegram announcing the return of The O'Donoghue in Tralee, which was\r\nreceived with hisses. He said the reason I had stood there was a\r\nrequisition, signed by Sir Henry Donovan, in the presence of nine grand\r\njurors of the County of Kerry, calling on me to do so. Sir Henry Donovan\r\nhad since turned over to The O'Donoghue from the man he had forced into\r\nthe field. Now that would teach them not to be fooled by Liberal\r\npromises. It almost made him believe no truth, no honour, and no\r\nsincerity existed among their opponents.\r\n\r\nThis was received with applause, which was renewed with laughter when\r\nMr. Young observed:--\r\n\r\n'I will make one remark. I think Sir Henry Donovan and The O'Donoghue\r\nare well met.'\r\n\r\nTo show that strong views in my favour were not confined to Protestants,\r\nI may quote the following letter written from the Augustinian Convent in\r\nDrogheda by J.A. Anderson, O.S.A.:--\r\n\r\n'If the electors of Tralee return Mr. O'Donoghue (_alias_ The\r\nO'Donoghue) as their representative in the coming Parliament, they will\r\nbe false to Ireland, false to the men that galvanised the dead body that\r\nGavan Duffy left on \"the dissecting table\" before starting for\r\nAustralia, and they will have the honour (?) of returning to Parliament\r\nthe greatest political renegade to Irish nationality that this\r\ngeneration has known.'\r\n\r\nA lady has recently drawn my attention to a footnote in Mr. Lecky's\r\n_History of Ireland_, where is quoted from a letter of my ancestor,\r\nColonel Maurice Hussey, the following opinion:--\r\n\r\n'It--i.e. Tralee--was a nest of thieves and smugglers, and so it always\r\nwill be until nine parts of ten of O'Donoghue's old followers be\r\nproclaimed and hanged on gibbets on the spot.'\r\n\r\nSo when O'Donoghues have troubled me, it is a case of history repeating\r\nitself, and if the percentage of the followers of the modern chieftain\r\nhad been 'removed'--as the modern phrase in Ireland ran--according to\r\nthe manner advocated by my ancestor, I could have voted in Parliament\r\nagainst dismembering the Empire to gratify the eagerness of an old man\r\nto truckle to the traitors of the country intrusted to his care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDRINK\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course one of the great troubles in Ireland is drink. I am no\r\nadvocate for teetotalism, for I think a man who can enjoy a moderate\r\nglass is a better one than his brother who has to drink water in order\r\nthat he may not yield to the overpowering 'tempitation'--to quote Mr.\r\nHuntley Wright--to get drunk! But for my fellow-countrymen I can see\r\nthat drink is a terrible curse, one which is the cause of half the\r\ncrime, half the illness, and more than half the misery that exists\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOf all Irish benefactors, possibly Father Mathew was the greatest; but\r\nin my boyish days, when it became known that men, not yet in a lunatic\r\nasylum, had taken up the notion that human life was possible without\r\nalcoholic drinks, the wits of Kerry and Cork were heartily diverted at\r\nthe bare idea.\r\n\r\nIt used to be the stock joke after dinner, even when Father Mathew was\r\nin the zenith of his triumph.\r\n\r\nIn Cork if you laugh at a thing you can generally suppress it, for,\r\nwhereas all Irishmen are keenly susceptible to ridicule, the Cork folk\r\nare even more so.\r\n\r\nThe cold water business furnished endless jests, but it survived them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the strangest thing of all was the clergyman who preached\r\nagainst it as being irreligious, taking as the text of his sermon,\r\n'Wine, that maketh glad the heart of man.'\r\n\r\nI like a man who is disinterested, therefore I wish to remind the\r\npresent generation that Father Mathew came of a stock of distillers, and\r\nhis family was among the first to suffer by his preaching.\r\n\r\nIt was probable there would be a reaction after his death; and when that\r\nevent took place, after the famine and fever, none really took his place\r\nto warn the diminishing population, in sufficiently effective fashion,\r\nof all the ills that drink was laying up for them.\r\n\r\nWherever, in my work, I found Government relief works, within a stone's\r\nthrow of every pay office a whisky shop started into operation.\r\n\r\nNew Ireland arose from the famine, and she has never since shown much\r\nsign of temperance. Indeed, an excessive amount of money is, and has\r\never since then been, spent on liquor in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAt Castleisland, the scene of so many outrages, the population of the\r\ntown is thirteen hundred, and the number of whisky shops is fifty-two.\r\nVery nearly the same proportion can be noticed in several other towns.\r\n\r\nThere never was an outrage committed without an empty whisky bottle\r\nbeing found close to the scene of the murder.\r\n\r\nIn the worst time a moonlighter slept for a fortnight close to the house\r\nof an Irish landlord, who was well aware that he was there for the\r\nexpress purpose of shooting him, but he never even attempted it.\r\n\r\n'Time after time I lay in a ditch to have a go at him, but he would ride\r\nby, looking for all the world as if he would shoot a flea off the tail\r\nof a shnipe, so that, with all the whisky in the world to help me, I\r\ndared not do it,' was his explanation before he left for America.\r\n\r\nDid you never hear the parish priest's sermon?\r\n\r\n'It's whisky makes you bate your wives; it's whisky makes your homes\r\ndesolate; it's whisky makes you shoot your landlords, and'--with\r\nemphasis, as he thumped the pulpit--'it's whisky makes you miss them.'\r\n\r\nThere is as much truth in that sermon as in any that was preached last\r\nSunday between Belfast and Glengariff.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the profits to the drink retailer are not so\r\nenormous as might be imagined, owing to the competition.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Castleisland there is one group of twelve houses\r\nand nine of these are whisky booths. However anxious the population may\r\nbe to consume immoderate amounts of the fiery liquor, and however large\r\nthe traffic on the road--never a big thing in Ireland, except on\r\nmarket-day--the division of the local receipts by nine is apt to\r\ndiminish the profits in each case.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to me by a lady who knows Kerry well, that the\r\nconsumption of drink might be diminished if a law were passed forcing\r\nthe publicans to sell food. As she very truly remarks, it is often\r\nimpossible for the country folk, even on market-day, when coming into a\r\ntown, to get food for immediate consumption.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not think this would have any effect. When away from his\r\ncabin the Irishman and the Irishwoman want drink, not food, for there\r\nare a few potatoes at home which will provide all the solid sustenance\r\nmost of them desire.\r\n\r\nIf her proposal were made law, each publican would keep a loaf in his\r\nwindow, and there it would stay for a year.\r\n\r\nThat reminds me of the man who was waiting in Waterford Station on March\r\n12th, and to pass the time had a ham sandwich at the bar.\r\n\r\nAfter one mouthful he asked the astonished barmaid for another, made of\r\nFebruary bread, because he really felt that it was time January bread\r\nmight have a rest.\r\n\r\nTo give an example of how Irishmen crave for drink, I will relate an\r\nincident connected with the Parnell Commission.\r\n\r\nThree of Lord Kenmare's tenants had been sent over in charge of an\r\nexperienced and reliable man to give evidence, and on their return\r\njourney, when they arrived at North Wall--the hour being 6 A.M.--the\r\nconductor said:--\r\n\r\n'There is cold meat, or bread and cheese. Now, what will your fancy be?'\r\n\r\nFar from wanting nutrition after an all night journey, or even the\r\nsoothing solace of a cup of tea, it was half a pint of whisky apiece\r\nthat they all asked for.\r\n\r\nJust as much drinking exists among the Protestants as among the Roman\r\nCatholics, only there is a trifle more geniality in the bibulous\r\npropensities of the latter. Much less affects an Irishman than a\r\nScotsman. The latter, when he has absorbed all the whisky he can\r\nassimilate in a bout--and no bad amount it is, let me observe--will go\r\nquietly to sleep. But an Irishman's joy is incomplete unless he knocks\r\nsomebody down, which may account for the fact that the Irish are the\r\nbest soldiers in the world.\r\n\r\nOne redeeming feature in the liquor traffic is the increasing\r\nconsumption of porter, for that at least has some nourishment in it, and\r\nis reasonably wholesome, whereas the whisky is vilely adulterated, not\r\nonly by the publicans before it reaches the consumer, but also in some\r\nof the factories.\r\n\r\nPuck Fair is the great annual fête and mart of Killorglin; and it is so\r\ncalled because a goat is always fastened to a stave on a platform, and\r\ngaily bedizened. Formerly the animal was attached to the flagstaff on\r\nthe Castle. To this fair all Kerry for many miles congregates, and the\r\nneighbouring roads towards evening are literally strewn with bibulous\r\nindividuals of either sex.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a Killorglin publican was in jail, and his father asked\r\nfor an interview because he wanted the recipe for manufacturing the\r\nspecial whisky for Puck Fair. It has been a constant practice to prepare\r\nthis blend, but the whisky does not keep many days, as may be gathered\r\nfrom the recipe, which the prisoner without hesitation dictated to his\r\nparent:--\r\n\r\nA gallon of fresh, fiery whisky. A pint of rum. A pint of methylated\r\nspirit. Two ounces of corrosive sublimate. Three gallons of water.\r\n\r\nAn Irishman's constitution must be tougher than that of an ostrich to\r\nenable him to consume much of the filthy poison. Temperance orators are\r\nwelcome to make what use they like of the recipe of this awful\r\ndecoction, annually sold to a confiding population.\r\n\r\nIt is not considered etiquette to come out of Killorglin sober on Puck\r\nFair; and, judging by the state of the people in the vicinity in the\r\nevening, this social custom is rigidly observed.\r\n\r\nThey are wonderfully particular in Kerry in attending to exactly what is\r\ncongenial to them, and if it were not for the thickness of their heads a\r\ngood many lives would be lost.\r\n\r\nThere was a gauger, in a central county in Ireland, killed by a blow on\r\nthe head from a stick.\r\n\r\nThe man who struck him, in his defence, stated:--\r\n\r\n'I did not hit him a very hard blow, and why the devil did the\r\nGovernment make a gauger of a man that had a head no thicker than an\r\negg-shell?'\r\n\r\nMighty few of the Killorglin folk have egg-shell heads, and the bulk of\r\nthese do not come to maturity.\r\n\r\nThe avowed fact that lunacy is largely on the increase in Ireland has\r\nbeen pronounced by the committee which sat on the question in Dublin to\r\nbe mainly due, not only to excessive drinking, but to the assimilation\r\nof adulterated spirits.\r\n\r\nThough the foregoing recipe furnishes a pretty fair example, I certainly\r\nwould not wager that it could not be beaten elsewhere in Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the priests were entirely apathetic on the subject, but\r\nlatterly they are bestirring themselves, and are doing their best to put\r\ndown wakes, which simply mean one or more nights of disgusting\r\nintemperance in the immediate vicinity of the corpse.\r\n\r\nKeening, by the way, is dying out, and what remains of this curious,\r\nmournful waiting is now almost entirely in the hands of old women who\r\nare experts in the art, and get remunerated not only in drink but also\r\nin cash.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, possible that when I am deploring the alcoholic\r\ntendencies of the Irishman, that these may be due to his more vegetarian\r\ndietary, and not to any undue natural craving for alcohol. This is borne\r\nout by the fact that no Irishman will willingly drink alone, and that\r\nhis potations are in the shops where whisky and porter are sold for\r\nconsumption on the premises, or at fairs, markets, weddings, or wakes,\r\nto the diminishing number of which I have just called attention.\r\n\r\nThe parish priest of Dingle recently stated in court that in a\r\npopulation of seventeen hundred there were over fifty licensed houses,\r\nand he rightly declared that all dealings in licences should for the\r\npresent be only by transfer, and that for five years at least no new\r\nlicences should be granted. The argument so often heard against stopping\r\nlicences is that then more illicit drinking will ensue, but this does\r\nnot convince me that the redundant licences should be renewed.\r\n\r\nMy remedy would be to increase all renewals of licences to fifty pounds\r\napiece, and to apply the difference as compensation to unrenewed\r\nlicences. If a man fits up his house as a shebeen, and has conducted it\r\ntolerably, he ought to receive just compensation when his licence is\r\ncancelled owing to there being too many in a district.\r\n\r\nIf this is not done, he would be the victim of as great a robbery as was\r\nperpetrated on the unfortunate landlords by the Land Act.\r\n\r\nI have a yarn or two on the subject of drink which may be appropriately\r\nrelated here.\r\n\r\nOld David Burus, the steward at Ardrum, County Cork, was a great\r\ncharacter who had got inextricably confused between the Council of Trent\r\nand the Trant family in the vicinity, and no amount of explanation could\r\never enlighten him. Directly he had begun to be jovial, he used to\r\nsay:--\r\n\r\n'My blessing on Councillor Trent, who put a fast on meat, but not on\r\ndrink.'\r\n\r\nAnd he proved the devoutness of his gratitude by conscientiously getting\r\ndrunk every Friday.\r\n\r\nThat recalls to my mind the case of the illustrious gentleman--also a\r\nfellow-countryman, I regret to say--who committed burglary and murder\r\nwhen there was an opportunity, but religiously refrained from eating\r\nmeat on Friday.\r\n\r\nReverting to David Burus: on one occasion I remonstrated with him on the\r\namount of whisky he drank.\r\n\r\n'I did drink a great deal of whisky, and I would have drunk more.' was\r\nhis reply, 'if I had known it was going to be as dear as it is now.'\r\n\r\nHe evidently regretted not having thoroughly saturated himself with\r\nalcohol. It was the only way in which he could have possibly increased\r\nhis consumption.\r\n\r\nHe was wont to say that if he had known the trick Mr. Gladstone was\r\ngoing to play on honest, God-fearing men, with sound stomachs and a\r\ndecent appetite, by imposing a ten shilling duty on every gallon of\r\nwhisky, he would have drunk his fill beforehand, even if _delirium\r\ntremens_ had been the penalty.\r\n\r\nSuch hard drinking as his, and so calmly avowed, must, even in the south\r\nof Ireland, be fortunately rare, for few constitutions can stand\r\nconversion into animated whisky vats.\r\n\r\nThere was a farmer at Kanturk railway station who confided to the\r\nstationmaster that he himself on the previous evening had been as drunk\r\nas the very devil.\r\n\r\nA parson on the platform, overhearing him, said:--\r\n\r\n'You make a mistake, my friend, the devil does not drink. He keeps his\r\nhead cool for the express purpose of watching such as you.'\r\n\r\nThe countryman replied:--\r\n\r\n'You seem to be very well acquainted with the respected gentleman's\r\nhabits, your riverince.'\r\n\r\nAnd then they walked off different ways.\r\n\r\nWhich reminds me of another clerical incident.\r\n\r\nA parish priest within twenty miles of Tralee, who subsequently left the\r\nChurch--I will not say on account of his thirst, though, as that was\r\nunquenchable, it no doubt conduced to his retirement--came into the\r\nparlour of the manager of the bank with two farmers to have a bill\r\ndiscounted.\r\n\r\nThe manager, having ascertained the farmers were good security, cashed\r\nthe bill and gave the proceeds to the priest. He was very much surprised\r\non the following day at the two farmers walking into his room with the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n'What's the meaning of this?' says he.\r\n\r\n'Well, your honour, we could not stay in the parish, if we refused to\r\njoin his reverence in the deal, which was sure to be a very bad one for\r\nus. So we thought the best thing to do was to get him a little hearty at\r\nhis own expense on the way home. And then we picked his pocket and have\r\nbrought the money to your honour, whilst he is cursing every thief\r\noutside his parish, and will probably ask the congregation to make up\r\nthe amount next Sunday.'\r\n\r\nAnd that is a true story, and as illustrative of the Irish peasant as\r\nany you could ever get told to you.\r\n\r\nA coffin-maker named Sullivan thrived in Tralee. He received an order\r\nfor a coffin for a man living about six miles away from the town. It was\r\nnot called for for a week, and so he went out to the house where the man\r\nlay dead to inquire the cause.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back to Tralee, he said to a friend:--\r\n\r\n'Who do you think I saw, Mick, but that scoundrel of a corpse sitting in\r\na ditch eating a piece of pig's cheek.'\r\n\r\nThat reminds me of another coffin story.\r\n\r\nA man who lived in Cork was notorious for being always behind time for\r\neverything. He knew his failing, and was rather touchy about it.\r\n\r\nOne night, stumbling out of a whisky shop, he lurched into a yard, fell\r\nagainst a door, which gave way, and finished his slumbers peacefully in\r\nthe shed, which was the storehouse of an undertaker.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he awoke, rubbed his eyes in astonishment at the strange\r\nsurroundings amid which he found himself, and after recollecting his own\r\npet proclivity, as he ruefully surveyed all the empty coffins,\r\nejaculated:--\r\n\r\n'Just my usual luck. Late for the Resurrection.'\r\n\r\nWhich recalls another tale:--\r\n\r\nA man was dead drunk, so some friends, for a lark, brought him into a\r\ndark room, lit a lot of phosphorus, and made up one of their party in\r\nthe guise of a devil before they flung a bucket of water over their\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n'Where am I?' asked the fellow, looking round 'skeered.'\r\n\r\n'In hell,' retorted the devil, with exaggerated solemnity.\r\n\r\n'Heaven bless your honour, as you know the ways of the place, will you\r\nget me a drop of drink?'\r\n\r\nBut a mere drop does not suffice as a friend of mine found out.\r\n\r\nHe was wont to reward his car-driver with a glass of whisky, and gave it\r\nto him in an antique glass, which did not contain as much as cabby\r\nwished for.\r\n\r\n'That's a very quare glass, captain,' says he.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' replied Captain Stevens; 'that's blown glass.'\r\n\r\n'Why, Captain,' says the carman, 'the man must have been damned short in\r\nthe breath that blew that.'\r\n\r\nThis would no doubt have been the opinion of a Dublin carman who was in\r\nthe habit of bringing a present to an acquaintance of mine from a lady\r\nliving at some distance, and being recompensed with a glass of grog. By\r\ndegrees, however, the water grew to be the predominant partner in the\r\nunion within the glass, so at last he burst out in disgust:--\r\n\r\n'If you threw a tumbler of whisky over Carlisle Bridge, it would be\r\nbetter grog than that at the Pigeon House.'\r\n\r\nWhich being interpreted into cockneyism would read, 'If you threw a\r\nglass of whisky over Westminster Bridge it would be better grog than\r\nthat at Greenwich Pier.'\r\n\r\nStill all consumption of liquor is not confined to Ireland, and I well\r\nremember when I was with Bogue in Scotland, that one night he had a\r\nfellow-farmer of the very best type to dine with him, and about ten\r\no'clock, with much difficulty, my man and I hoisted him into the saddle.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards we heard a knock at the door, and a voice rather\r\nquaveringly inquired:--\r\n\r\n'Pleash, can you tell me the way to X., I have lost my way?'\r\n\r\nThe tracks next morning revealed he had been riding round and round the\r\nhouse without once quitting the vicinity, which was almost as bad as\r\nMark Twain's famous nocturnal perambulation with his pedometer, when he\r\nwent on a tramp abroad!\r\n\r\nOf potation stories I could tell scores more, and the Tralee Club has\r\nseen enough whisky imbibed within its walls to drown all the members.\r\n\r\nA quaint character named Mullane was at one time steward, and decidedly\r\nastonished a member, who was a total abstainer, by charging him in his\r\nbill for three tumblers of punch.\r\n\r\n'Well,' explained Mullane, 'it's this way. Some take six tumblers, and\r\nsome takes none, so I strikes an average--and to tell you the truth,\r\nit's mighty convenient for the great majority.'\r\n\r\nA quaint member of the club was Mr. Edward Morris. He was extremely\r\ndiminutive, and he wore an eyeglass. One evening he was standing on the\r\nfirst landing, pondering in a bemused state whether he could get\r\ndownstairs without falling, when a pursey little doctor trotted past him\r\nwithout even touching the bannister.\r\n\r\nThis inspired Morris with courage, so he let go his hold of the\r\nbalustrade, whereupon he promptly fell on the physician, and both rolled\r\nto the bottom of the stairs.\r\n\r\nThence in hiccuping tones were heard:--\r\n\r\n'Waiter! Waiter, put the glass in my eye, and let me see who the\r\nscoundrel was who struck me.'\r\n\r\nOn another evening in the club, when he had imbibed very freely, he\r\nordered an additional glass of grog, and began to moralise aloud,\r\naddressing it after this fashion:--\r\n\r\n'Glass of grog, if I drink you now, you'll cut the legs from under me.\r\nAnd yet I want you, and I will not do without you. So I know what I will\r\ndo. I'll go to bed and I'll drink you there, for I don't care a damn\r\nwhat you do to me then.'\r\n\r\nThe indifference of a drunken man to subsequent consequences was rather\r\nquaintly shown by that weird individual Dr. Tanner, when he went up to\r\nSir Ellis Ashmead Bartlett in the lobby of the House of Commons, and\r\nabruptly observed:--\r\n\r\n'You're a fool.'\r\n\r\nSir Ellis fixed him with his eyeglass, and, in disgusted tones,\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n'You're drunk.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose so,' retorted the Irishman, 'but then I'll be sober\r\nto-morrow'--in the most plaintive tone, then in a crescendo of scorn--'\r\nwhereas you'll always be a fool.'\r\n\r\nMoreover as he slouched down the lobby, he was heard to say:--\r\n\r\n'If I do get a headache, I've a head to have it in, not a frame on which\r\nto hang an eyeglass.'\r\n\r\nThat is a political amenity on which I will not dwell.\r\n\r\nVery little money-lending is to be heard of in the south of Ireland, and\r\nin all my experience I only remember one case in Kerry. Tenants in\r\nIreland, however, have great horror of breaking bulk, and many of them\r\nwill do a bill for a neighbour when they have deposits in the bank for\r\nthemselves. As it is a point of honour never to refuse a friend in this\r\nrespect, you can easily imagine the amount of 'paper' which is\r\nfluttering.\r\n\r\nEven when a farmer has a tidy sum of money on deposit with the bank at\r\none per cent., if he wants to employ a sum for a short time, say for the\r\npurchase of cattle, he prefers to raise the money on a bill at six per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the bank is lending him his own money at five per\r\ncent.--a truly Hibernian trait, which it would be difficult to beat\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nA bill for drink is not recoverable, but occasionally an insidious\r\npublican will take a man's I.O.U. and sue on that.\r\n\r\nOne applied to me to help him to get the money from a tenant.\r\n\r\n'You must show me the account,' said I.\r\n\r\nAs I suspected, there was whisky in it, and I declined on the spot.\r\n\r\nAll drink in Ireland is on cash down terms only.\r\n\r\nIf they gave tick, they would never recover the money, and if every\r\nIrishman is a knowing scoundrel, the publican is a trifle more\r\nknowledgable than the customer, whose brains are besodden.\r\n\r\nA man, who had been a servant of mine, started a public near Tralee, and\r\nthinking he would get customers from the other whisky stores, he gave\r\ntick. His popularity lasted just as long as the tick did, and a week\r\nlater he was broke. I do not say so much about Tralee being able to\r\nsupport one hundred and sixty liquor shops, because there is a little\r\nshipping, but how Cahirciveen can enable fifty publicans to thrive is a\r\nmelancholy mystery to me.\r\n\r\nI was animadverting once, at Dingle, on the topic, when one of my\r\nlabourers remarked:--\r\n\r\n'It's the gentry does the drinking.'\r\n\r\n'Now that's very curious,' said I, 'for as there are only two of us, and\r\nas I never touch spirits, the other must have such a thirst that he'd\r\nconsume the bay if only it were made of whisky.'\r\n\r\nIn these democratic days, it is as well to resist any undue aspersion on\r\nthe upper classes.\r\n\r\nTo pass any aspersion on the bibulous propensities of a tenant of mine\r\nnamed Flaherty would be impossible. When he was buying his farm, I told\r\nhim the Government ought to take him on very easy terms, when they\r\nbecame his landlords.\r\n\r\n'And for why?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Because,' I replied, 'the duty you pay on the whisky you drink is more\r\nthan twenty times your annual rent.'\r\n\r\nI had, however, one personal illustration of the drinking propensity in\r\nScotland, which I think is worth preserving. It is some years now since\r\nI went to see a certain farmer who, his wife told me, on noticing my\r\napproach, was compelled to go upstairs to cool his head as it was after\r\ndinner. She said this much in the same casual tone, as I should mention\r\nthat my wife had gone up early to dress for that meal.\r\n\r\nNext, I heard heavy splashing of water, and then a crash which portended\r\nthat the farmer had fallen over the washstand, making a fearful clatter.\r\n\r\nIn rushed the drab of a servant maid, perfectly indifferent to my\r\npresence, shrieking:--\r\n\r\n'O missus, come up, come up, the maister is just miraculous among the\r\nchaney!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPRIESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been asked, since my friends became aware that I am perpetrating\r\nmy reminiscences, whether I was going to write anything supplemental to\r\nMr. MacCarthy's _Priests and People_, and _Five Tears in Ireland_.\r\n\r\nMy reply was:--\r\n\r\n'Certainly not.'\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I have many friends among Roman Catholics, and plenty of\r\ncheery acquaintances among the priests. Secondly, the state of feud and\r\nhostility on which Mr. MacCarthy dilates is more likely to be found in\r\nUlster and Leinster than in Kerry, where the Roman Catholics form more\r\nthan nine-tenths of the population.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when a distinguished Englishman was staying at\r\nKillarney House, I told him that he should go to the north to see the\r\nstrangest sight in the world--two races hating one another for the love\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nIt is not my business to estimate what would happen in Kerry if a few\r\nthousand rabid Orangemen were plumped down among the present\r\ninhabitants; but according to existing circumstances creeds are not torn\r\nto tatters nor religion disfigured by strife and slander.\r\n\r\nAll the same, I am bound to say that the Roman Catholic priests, when I\r\nwas young, were much superior to those of to-day. They were drawn from a\r\nbetter class, because, having to be educated at Rome, or, at least, as\r\nfar away as St. Omer, entailed some considerable outlay by their\r\nrelatives. Moreover, they brought back from their continental seminaries\r\nbroader ideas than can be acquired in purely Irish colleges. Their\r\ninterest had been stimulated at the most impressionable age in much of\r\nwhich the farmers and labourers had no conception. Therefore the priest\r\ncould address his flock with authority, and was invariably looked up to\r\nas well as obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe parish priest at Blarney erected a tower in commemoration of the\r\nbattle of Waterloo, and a public house in the vicinity bears the name to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nWhat parish priest would raise a memorial to any English victory in the\r\ntwentieth century?\r\n\r\nThe greatest curse to the Irish nation has been Maynooth, because it has\r\nfostered the ordination of peasants' sons. These are uneducated men who\r\nhave never been out of Ireland, whose sympathies are wholly with the\r\nclass from which they have sprung, and who are given no training\r\ncalculated to afford them a broader view than that of the narrowest\r\nclass prejudice.\r\n\r\nAs for the much discussed Irish university, I do not myself believe it\r\nwill be founded.\r\n\r\nShould even an English Government be blind enough to allow it, an Irish\r\nuniversity could only become a hot-bed of treason, and practically all\r\neducated members of the Roman Catholic community would avoid sending\r\ntheir sons to such a seminary of sedition, where the influence would be\r\ninsidiously directed to make the undergraduates even more hostile to\r\nEngland than they already are by inherited instincts and by all they\r\nhave been told in their own homes.\r\n\r\nOn the very day this page is written, I have mentioned the question of\r\nan Irish university to two Protestants in the Carlton, both Members of\r\nParliament, and both approved of the idea in a languid way. I have also\r\nmooted the topic this afternoon to two leading Roman Catholics, and both\r\nvehemently disapproved, alleging that it will work endless mischief.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1872 Dr. Macaulay wrote:--\r\n\r\n'The Irish university question has been put off from year to year, and\r\nat length presses for settlement.'\r\n\r\nIn the best interests of Ireland, may the same thing be written thirty\r\nyears hence!\r\n\r\nIf the Roman Catholics of England send their sons to Oxford and\r\nCambridge, why should not more Irish Roman Catholics send theirs to\r\nTrinity College, Dublin? Only a very few do, although the education is\r\nsaid to be quite as good as at either of the great English Universities.\r\nA far tighter hold is kept, however, on the Roman Catholic laity in\r\nIreland than in England. It always surprises English people to learn\r\nthat, in Ireland, Roman Catholics are not allowed to enter Protestant\r\nchurches to attend either funerals or weddings. Nor do I think there is\r\nmuch probability of these restrictions being removed.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the years of outrage and terror in Ireland, many of the\r\npriests from the altar denounced loyal members of the congregation, or\r\nincited their hearers to deeds of wickedness by their inflammatory\r\nsermons. These facts are among the blackest in the history of any creed,\r\nand I do not hesitate to class the work of some of the priests who\r\ndisgraced their Church with the worst perpetrations of the Spanish\r\nInquisition.\r\n\r\nFortunately all priests were not, and are not, after this style. I have\r\nknown many good and worthy men among them, as well as capital fellows,\r\nfond of a joke. Moreover, the Roman Catholic Church did not always take\r\nthe side of the Land League.\r\n\r\nFor example, the bishops and parish priests laboured assiduously to get\r\nLord Granard his rents from his estates in Longford.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause Maynooth held a great mortgage on the property.\r\n\r\nIn the famous De Freyne case, the parish priest energetically assisted\r\nthe landlord in every way in his power, because the property was heavily\r\nmortgaged with Roman Catholic charges.\r\n\r\nThese are two facts that occur to me on the spur of the moment, and\r\nprobably other people could supply similar instances.\r\n\r\nAs for the Episcopacy, it was the violence of Dr. Walsh, the Archbishop\r\nof Dublin, which prevented him from obtaining the coveted cardinal's\r\nhat. This was given to Dr. Logue, the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate\r\nof Ireland, a witty, capable, clever man, who had such an inveterate\r\nhabit of taking snuff that he did so even when conversing with Queen\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\n'It prevents me from sniffing out heresy,' he explained, with a twinkle,\r\n'and so gives me an excuse for shutting my eyes to the different views\r\nof my neighbours.'\r\n\r\nThe Queen was much amused, but the remark conveyed a true view of Irish\r\nCatholicism.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, his bishop can do very little with a treasonable man when\r\nonce he has been inducted a parish priest; and the curate who obtains\r\nirregular fees, of course, panders even more to the taste of his\r\ncongregation. A bishop will haul up a tonsured subordinate mighty sharp\r\nfor any breach of ecclesiastical duty, but when it comes to politics and\r\ninstigation to crime, he finds it far more difficult to keep a tight\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAs a broad rule it may be stated that the bishops are well selected, and\r\nare of a much higher type than the average priest.\r\n\r\nOf the bishops of Killarney, Moriarty put down Fenianism with no light\r\nhand, preaching, as I have already shown, in the most manly and emphatic\r\nstyle--which could have been emulated with advantage in other\r\nEpiscopacies in my country. MacCarthy was a bookworm from Maynooth, who\r\nplayed the deuce with the diocese, allowing all the priests to run wild,\r\nand by his laxity becoming criminally responsible for much of the\r\nterrible condition of Kerry. Higgins was the nominee of a friend of\r\nMoriarty, and he worked hard to suppress outrages, by which course he\r\ncertainly did not add to his popularity among his flock. In his upright\r\nand courageous conduct he has been worthily emulated by his successor,\r\nCoffey, whose demise occurred only in the present year.\r\n\r\nKerry possesses one bishop, fifty-one parish priests and administrators,\r\nsixty-nine curates, and eleven priests occupied in tuition.\r\n\r\nThere are six religious houses for males, and seventeen convents,\r\nrepresenting about five hundred inhabitants, as well as three hundred\r\nstudents, which, with the occupants of subsidiary sacerdotal\r\nestablishments, is estimated to make up 1265 persons.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, when the population of Kerry was 196,586, there were 337\r\npriests and nuns. In 1901, when the population had become reduced to\r\n165,726, the priests and nuns had increased to 546.\r\n\r\nAnd these statistics bring me to a salient point:--\r\n\r\nThe one reality above all others in Irish life is the grip of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIn the last book which I have received from the library--_Paddy-Risky_\r\nby Mr. Andrew Merry--one of the stories is that of a poor widow\r\nbeggaring herself in order to provide the parish chapel with a bell, and\r\nthat is the kind of thing you hear of everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church presides over every function in the life of\r\neach member of its community, and the priest charges heavily for\r\nadministering the rites.\r\n\r\nAt a wedding he does not take a prescribed fee, but makes a bargain,\r\nusually with the family of the bride. I have known as much as\r\ntwenty-five pounds paid to a priest at a small farmer's marriage; and\r\nthe sum obtained is very often out of all proportion to the dowry of the\r\nbride, or even to the funds of the happy pair.\r\n\r\nAn example may be cited--the case of a labourer in my own employ, who\r\nreceived forty pounds as his wife's fortune, and had to pay eight to the\r\nparish priest.\r\n\r\nIt is the same thing with funerals, over which a ridiculous amount is\r\nstill spent, although the wake is falling into disrepute under the ban\r\nof the Church, and women are now rarely hired to 'keen.' There is a\r\ncraze to have a number of priests attending the service, and a good many\r\nof them do go, very well pleased, as to a picnic.\r\n\r\nIn parishes where the poverty is something appalling the members of the\r\ncongregation not only contribute Peter's Pence, but you cannot go into\r\nthe chapel without seeing some tiny candles lighted before the altar of\r\nMary, which must literally represent the scriptural mites of the widow\r\nand orphan.\r\n\r\nBefore I relapse into a few stories, let me say something about the\r\nProtestant clergy.\r\n\r\nThey are nearly always recruited from the ranks of the smaller Irish\r\ngentry, and whilst, perhaps, richer in proportion than many of the\r\ncurates and incumbents in England, there are no 'fat' livings, and all\r\nare distinctly poorer since the Disestablishment.\r\n\r\nThe average in Kerry, and over most of the south of Ireland, is a\r\nstipend of two hundred pounds a year, which involves reading services in\r\ntwo churches each Sunday, and therefore puts the clergyman to the\r\nexpense of keeping a horse and trap.\r\n\r\nAbout 1820 the district around Castleisland was divided into three\r\nparishes--Castleisland, Ballincushlane, and Killeentierna--the joint\r\nrevenues of which were eighteen hundred a year. These were vested in the\r\nLord Bandon of the time, who lived in the lovely cottage on the upper\r\nLake of Killarney.\r\n\r\nHe allowed a curate fifty pounds a year to do the joint duties, and I\r\nhardly think the man was worth the money. He subsequently obtained a\r\nGovernment living and was in the habit of asking his congregation, as\r\nthey went into church, whether they wanted a sermon or not. The general\r\nconcensus of opinion was a polite negative--to the relief of all\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nThe method of electing a vicar in Ireland since the Disestablishment is\r\nboth sensible and practical.\r\n\r\nThree parish nominators, one lay diocesan nominator, two clerical\r\ndiocesan nominators, and the bishop, between them, choose the new\r\nincumbent. By the constitution of this Court of Election, it is certain\r\nthat no one will be appointed to whom the parish objects, whilst if the\r\nparish desires the nomination of an incompetent man, that is checked by\r\nthe diocesan voters in conjunction with the bishop.\r\n\r\nIn fact it is an admirable system, far better than the patronage plan\r\nstill rampant in England.\r\n\r\nThe Irish bishops are also chosen by nominators drawn from the clergy\r\nand laity of the diocese, provided a two-thirds majority be obtained for\r\nany one candidate. If not, the Irish bench of bishops jointly selects\r\nthe new wearer of lawn sleeves.\r\n\r\nThis, again, works with perfect smoothness and never arouses the\r\nill-feeling aroused by the selections nominally made by the Prime\r\nMinister. To-day the _Foundations of Belief_ may not be an essay which\r\ncauses confidence in the ability of the author to pick the best bishops,\r\nand all the much-vaunted religious convictions of Mr. Gladstone did not\r\nmake his nominations to the Episcopacy particularly successful. It is\r\nnow no secret that Lord Cairns used to choose bishops for Disraeli and\r\nthat Lord Shaftesbury often was consulted by Prime Ministers who knew\r\nmore about sport than clericalism.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can recollect, among all the Irish clergy I have met not one\r\nwas an Englishman, though there are plenty of Irish in the English\r\nEstablished Church.\r\n\r\nAll the Disestablished Church of Ireland is exceedingly\r\nanti-ritualistic.\r\n\r\n'I do not want Mock-Turtle, when I am so near real Turtle,' said Sir\r\nGeorge Shiel, when asked to visit St. Alban's, Holborn, one of the\r\nRitualistic temples--an observation which represents the feeling\r\nanimating clergy and laity in Ireland, though they are none the better\r\npleased that out of the funds of the Disestablishment, Maynooth should\r\nhave received a capitalised sum equal to the previous annual grant from\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAnd now for just a few clerical tales.\r\n\r\nA man was dying and the priest was with him.\r\n\r\n'Ah, Father Philip,' said the poor fellow, 'I am sure the likes of you\r\nwould never be deceiving a poor man and him on his deathbed. Tell me\r\nstraight, is my soul all right?'\r\n\r\n'It is, my son, and in a very short time you'll be in the company of the\r\nBlessed Saints.'\r\n\r\n'In that case, Father, I'll tell the devil he may just kiss my toe and\r\nbad luck to him for all the trouble I have had to get out of his\r\nclutches,' and the priest noticed his last sigh was one of complete\r\nsatisfaction--no doubt anticipatory.\r\n\r\nPurgatory forms the foundation of many stories.\r\n\r\nA certain very poor widow was paying the priest money for the soul of\r\nher son, who was killed in a faction fight.\r\n\r\n'And it's more masses you must have Mrs. Murphy, for Paddy has only got\r\nhis red hair out of purgatory.'\r\n\r\nLater, when she was asked for further contributions:--\r\n\r\n'It's his mouth which is out now, and he sends his mother on earth\r\nmessages to have prayers said to get him to heaven.'\r\n\r\nA third time did Widow Murphy give the priest what she could not in the\r\nleast afford.\r\n\r\nYet again he reported progress.\r\n\r\n'Now you must make a great effort, for his head and shoulders are out of\r\npurgatory.'\r\n\r\n'Then it's devil another penny of mine will go for masses, for if my Pat\r\nhas his head and shoulders out, I can safely reckon he'll soon wriggle\r\nhimself away entirely, God bless the poor darling.'\r\n\r\nAnother purgatory tale, this time concerning Father Batt.\r\n\r\nA fellow-priest came to see him, and over a friendly glass:--\r\n\r\n'And what's the news?' asked Father Batt.\r\n\r\n'None that I know on earth, but I do hear tell that the floor of\r\npurgatory has given way and all the inhabitants have fallen into hell.'\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oh, the poor Protestants, that will be all crushed by the weight atop\r\nof them,' was Father Batt's rejoinder.\r\n\r\nFew priests in Kerry have been better known or more beloved than he,\r\nalmost the last of the old-fashioned school, and he was always warm\r\nfriends with his Protestant colleague in Milltown, where he resided.\r\n\r\nFather Batt invariably took a few tumblers of hot whisky punch after\r\ndinner, and having got ill was advised by the doctor to give it up and\r\ntake to claret.\r\n\r\nWhen the bishop met him some time later, he said:--\r\n\r\n'Well, Father Batt, I am afraid you do not like claret so well as the\r\nwhisky.'\r\n\r\n'It's this way, my lord,' he replied. 'I don't object to the taste so\r\nmuch as I thought I should, but I find it very tedious.'\r\n\r\nIt is with some diffidence that I venture upon a convent story. To begin\r\nwith, I am a Protestant, and secondly, in relation to one of these\r\nladies' clubs under sacerdotal patronage I feel like Paul Pry, always\r\napologetic when putting in an appearance.\r\n\r\nStill, the tale is quite innocent and is absolutely true.\r\n\r\nThe convent is in Kerry and up to recently the order had been an\r\nenclosed one. But a papal edict arrived one day, bidding the nuns go out\r\nto teach, and to collect, as well as to relieve, the suffering in their\r\nown homes.\r\n\r\nThe Mother Superior was exceedingly wroth.\r\n\r\n'What!' quoth she. 'Does the Holy Father want to be interfering with me\r\nafter I have been within these walls for the last eight-and-twenty\r\nyears? I am not going to begin tramping the roads at my time of life,\r\nnot for the Holy Father himself, no, nor all the Cardinals too. A pretty\r\nstate of things indeed. Why, he'll be telling me to ride a bicycle\r\nnext!'\r\n\r\nThe county of Cork was at one time so notorious for cattle-stealing that\r\na Roman Catholic bishop went down specially to admonish them.\r\n\r\nWhen telling one parish priest to be firm with his congregation on the\r\nsubject, the bishop observed:--\r\n\r\n'Nothing is more clearly laid down in the Bible than that if a man has\r\npossession of another man's property he can never enter the kingdom of\r\nheaven.'\r\n\r\n'The Saints preserve us,' exclaimed the priest; 'there'll be plenty of\r\nempty houses there.'\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for a priest to get a bit of truth by accident or by\r\ncunning from one of his flock.\r\n\r\nThe parish priest was congratulating a man who had married three wives\r\nupon getting a bit of money with each, and received this answer:--\r\n\r\n'Well, your reverence, I did not do badly at all, but between the\r\nweddings and the funerals, your reverence took care it was not all clear\r\nprofit.'\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of hard barter about the terms of these ceremonies, and\r\non one occasion at Brosna, when the curate stood out for three pounds as\r\nhis fee for performing the marriage service, the would-be bridegroom\r\nheld out a thirty shilling note, saying:--\r\n\r\n'Marry yourself to this, your reverence, and we'll be happy with your\r\nblessing.'\r\n\r\nAs the persuasive eloquence of another man could not abate the price\r\nwhich his priest demanded for a funeral, he blurted out:--\r\n\r\n'Why, the blessed corpse in purgatory would shiver at the thought of\r\ncosting so much to put away, and we but poor folk, with the pig that\r\ncontrary we don't know whether the litter will survive.'\r\n\r\nHere is a fish story connected with a member of my own family, Miss\r\nClarissa Hussey, who was my aunt, and also a pious Roman Catholic. She\r\nused to hospitably entertain her confessor Father Tom, a priest with a\r\nkeen appreciation of the good things of the table. Among his\r\nparishioners it was known that he indicated the value he put on the\r\ncoming fare by the length of his preliminary grace.\r\n\r\nOn a certain Friday in Lent he dined with her, and on a huge dish being\r\nput down in front of his hostess, he expected a fine salmon, and\r\nshutting his eyes proceeded to pronounce a benediction the length of\r\nwhich greatly gratified my aunt. On the cover being removed, however,\r\nhis face fell, and in severe tones he rebuked her:--\r\n\r\n'Was it for bake, ma'am, that I offered up the full grace?'\r\n\r\nNor could he be appeased all through the meal.\r\n\r\nThat leads me to relate the funeral sermon delivered by a clergyman on a\r\nlady who had died suddenly at her morning meal:--\r\n\r\n'You all, dear brethren, well know the loss we have sustained in our\r\ndeparted sister. She was ever alert and kindly, ever bountiful though\r\nwithout extravagance. To the last she preserved her characteristics. On\r\nthe fatal morning of her removal from among us, she rose as usual and\r\ncame to the family breakfast-table. With no premonition of what was to\r\ncome she took her egg-spoon and cracked her egg, an egg laid by one of\r\nher own hens. In another moment failure of the heart transferred her to\r\na higher sphere. She began that egg on earth, she finished it in\r\nheaven.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCONSTABULARY AND DISPENSARY DOCTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Englishman once asked me, if I could suggest any way by which all\r\nIreland could be made loyal. I inquired if he thought the Irish\r\nconstabulary a loyal body.\r\n\r\n'Most decidedly,' said he, without hesitation.\r\n\r\n'Then,' I replied, 'if you will pay every Irishman seventy pounds a year\r\nfor doing nothing, but look after other people's affairs--a thing by\r\nnature congenial to him as it is--you'll have the most loyal race on\r\nearth.'\r\n\r\nThat Englishman went away thoughtful, but I had shown him the solution\r\nof one Irish problem which may be stated thus:--\r\n\r\nWhy do one half of the sons of farmers in Ireland, who have been or are\r\nmembers of the Irish constabulary, represent a body of men unequalled\r\nfor their respectability, loyalty, and courage, while a large proportion\r\nof the other, at least in the eighties, made up the bulk of the ignoble\r\narmy of moonlighters, cattle maimers, and cowardly assassins crouching\r\nbehind stone walls to shoot at an unsuspecting victim in the opening?\r\n\r\nThe answer is _£ s. d._, not an agreeable one, but truth is not always\r\ncomposed of sweetstuff.\r\n\r\nThe constabulary are recruited from the sons of peasants and farmers.\r\nThey are drilled, disciplined, well fed, well clothed, well paid, and\r\nshow themselves well conducted. During all the bad times, there was not\r\na single case of a disaffected man, though every sort of inducement must\r\nhave been brought to bear on them. The prevailing characteristic of all\r\nranks has been the high sense of duty, so that they composed the most\r\nmobile and the most effective corps in Europe.\r\n\r\nAs detectives, they have, however, proved quite ineffective, because the\r\npeasant has everywhere been too shrewd for them; 'yet the relative\r\nposition of the police to the people, and the intimate connection with\r\nAmerica, marked it out as a force peculiarly adapted to the prevention\r\nand detection of crime committed in Ireland, but often inspired from\r\nAmerica.' So wrote one of the most experienced resident magistrates, Mr.\r\nClifford Lloyd, afterwards Minister of the Interior in Egypt, and\r\nsubsequently Lieutenant Governor of the Mauritius and Consul at\r\nErzeroum, where he died at the age of forty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe constabulary are enlisted without any consideration of creed, but\r\nwhen Sir Duncan MacGregor was at the head of the force he arranged that\r\nof the five men in every police barrack, two should be Protestant, and\r\nthree Roman Catholic, or _vice-versa_. This check has subsequently been\r\nswept away, by no means to the advantage of the service.\r\n\r\nVery recently the Inspector General, and the Assistant Inspector General\r\nretired, and their places were filled by an Englishman and an Irishman,\r\nneither of whom had been in the force, which gave rise to great and\r\nwell-founded dissatisfaction. One of the pair is a warm friend of my\r\nown, but that is no reason why I should approve of the appointment.\r\n\r\nWhile the bulk of the officers are Irish gentlemen, educated in Ireland,\r\nEnglishmen are also to be found among them. Officers enter by nomination\r\nafter passing an examination designed to show that they are not\r\n'crammed,' but the perversity of the examiners has always thwarted this\r\nexcellent intention. That is like the admirable purpose of Cabinet\r\nMinisters, bent on reforming their different departments, but\r\ndexterously 'blocked' by the permanent officials.\r\n\r\nBefore the reduction commenced by Mr. Wyndham, the Constabulary numbered\r\n10,679, and cost £1,390,917. In my opinion it will be found necessary in\r\nthe future, not only to keep the force up to its full strength, but to\r\nmaterially increase its number so soon as the Government becomes the\r\nsole landlord in Ireland, especially now that they are going to have\r\nVolunteers in the country.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this force merely means that landlords will be shot at\r\nhalf price; so, for the sake of their own skins, the latter had better\r\nget clear of the country before the recruits have had much musketry\r\ninstruction. The badness of the shooting saved many a landlord in the\r\neighties, and if that is remedied, why they will be popped as easily as\r\nmy grandson knocks over rabbits.\r\n\r\nThere is a story of an English tourist seeking for information about the\r\ndistressful country, he being at Tallaght near Dublin.\r\n\r\nHe asked his carman whether there were many Fenians about.\r\n\r\n'A terrible lot, your honour,' replied the fellow.\r\n\r\n'I suppose a thousand?' the tourist suggested, somewhat apprehensively.\r\n\r\n'That is so, and twenty thousand more,' answered the carman without\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n'Are they armed?' was the next question.\r\n\r\n'They are that, and finely into the bargain.'\r\n\r\n'And are they prepared to come out?' the tourist being much perturbed,\r\nand thinking it would be his duty to write to the _Times_.\r\n\r\n'Prepared to come out in the morning, your honour.'\r\n\r\n'And why don't they do so?' with English common sense.\r\n\r\n'Begorra, because maybe if they did, the constabulary would put them in\r\njail.'\r\n\r\nSo the constabulary have some value after all, in spite of the sneers of\r\nHome Rule members in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen Kerry priests screeched with laughter when I told them that\r\nstory in the train, having met them on a journey to Farranfore.\r\n\r\nHere is another I also gave them on that occasion.\r\n\r\nA couple of policemen were discussing the state of Ireland once upon a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSays Dan to Mick:--\r\n\r\n'Sure we'll niver get peace and quiet in the blessed country until we\r\nfetch Oliver Cromwell up from hell to settle the unruly.'\r\n\r\nReplies Mick to Dan:--\r\n\r\n'Have done, you fool, isn't he a deal quieter where he is?'\r\n\r\nJudge Keagh thought worse of his fellow countrymen than do other men\r\nwith less than his great experience, and although a Roman Catholic, he\r\nhad to be escorted by two constables wherever he went.\r\n\r\nHe was told that he ought to be guarded by four policemen, because the\r\ntwo might be attacked.\r\n\r\nBut he knew the man that said it wanted to make the protection more\r\nconspicuous, so he replied:--\r\n\r\n'Sir, I have the most implicit confidence in the invincible cowardice of\r\nmy fellow countrymen.'\r\n\r\nThat recalls an observation of my own.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, a telegram was sent from the Chief Inspector of\r\nConstabulary in Kerry to the Scotland Yard authorities to say there was\r\nto be an attempt to murder me in London, and in consequence a gentleman\r\nfrom the department for providing traffic directors in metropolitan\r\nstreets called at my house in Elvaston Place, to inquire what police\r\nprotection I wanted.\r\n\r\n'None,' said I, 'for if a man shoots me in London he'll be hung, and\r\nevery Irish scoundrel is careful of his own neck. It's altogether\r\nanother matter in Ireland, where Mr. Gladstone has carefully provided\r\nthat he shall be tried by a jury, the majority of which are certain to\r\nbe land leaguers.'\r\n\r\nI brought out the same idea on a more important occasion.\r\n\r\nOnce, in Mr. Froude's house, Professor Max Müller--who was a great\r\nadmirer of Mr. Gladstone--remarked that after all I had not much reason\r\nto complain, because I had had plenty of police protection in Ireland.\r\n\r\n'I should prefer equal laws,' said I.\r\n\r\n'What inequality of law have you to find fault with?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Well,' I replied, 'if a land leaguer shoots me in Ireland, he will be\r\ntried by a jury of land leaguers. If I shoot one of them, I would\r\nrequire that I be tried by a jury of landlords, and if that be granted\r\nI'll clear the road for myself of all suspicious characters, and ask for\r\nno more police protection than you require at Oxford.'\r\n\r\nHe subsided at that, and Froude laughed at him so heartily, that he had\r\nnot another word to say on the subject all day.\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear the rhyme about moonlighting? It runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n  'The difference betwixt moonlight and moonshine\r\n   The people at last understand,\r\n   For moonlight's the law of the League\r\n   And moonshine is the law of the land.'\r\n\r\nThat would have clinched my argument beyond all dispute, but the\r\nexpressive poem was not written at that time.\r\n\r\nReverting to the topics of this chapter, it is needless to observe that\r\nthere is a bond of connection between constabulary and dispensary\r\ndoctors, for the latter are needed on many occasions to attend to the\r\nwounds of those just arrested.\r\n\r\nThe dispensary doctors do not form a satisfactory feature of Irish life,\r\nsimply because the farmers elect individuals out of friendship.\r\n\r\nA dispensary doctor had to be appointed at Farranfore, and I was most\r\nanxious to get the best man for the position. So I proposed that the\r\ncandidates' papers should all be submitted to Sir Dominic Corragun, a\r\nRoman Catholic physician of high standing in Dublin.\r\n\r\nI could not even get a seconder to my motion, which therefore fell\r\nstillborn, and I wrote to Lord Kenmare that if Gull or Jenner had been\r\nsuggested, neither of them would have obtained three votes.\r\n\r\nVirtually the appointment of the dispensary doctor is vested in the\r\ndispensary Committee, which is a local body, usually consisting of one\r\nor more guardians, and four or five specially elected ratepayers. In the\r\nsame way are chosen all the local sanitary authorities, who are of\r\ncourse under the District Council.\r\n\r\nYou remember that _Punch_ called the sanitary inspector the insanitary\r\nspectre, but the beneficent climate of Ireland fortunately averts all\r\nthe evils his authority would not be able to arrest if it came to really\r\nchecking filth.\r\n\r\nI remember the occasion of the election of another dispensary doctor,\r\nwhen I was curtly told that only a moonlighter could hope to be\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nMy reply was:--\r\n\r\n'I suppose it is easier for him to poison people when he is drunk than\r\nto shoot landlords when in an inebriated condition.'\r\n\r\nI do know that a dispensary doctor not thirty miles from Killarney was\r\nthrown out of his trap, because he drove the horse through his own front\r\ndoor, when he was under the intoxicated impression he was entering his\r\nstable yard.\r\n\r\nHe broke his leg, and as there was no one to set it, he told his nephew\r\nto get a pail of plaster of Paris, and he himself would tell him how to\r\nmanage the operation.\r\n\r\nFirst they had a glass of whisky to fortify them for the ordeal, and\r\nthen another, and after that a third to drink good luck to the broken\r\nleg.\r\n\r\nFinally, when they set about it, the nephew spilt the whole pail of\r\nplaster of Paris over the bed in which his uncle lay, and then fell in a\r\ndrunken stupor into the mess. There they both stayed all night until\r\nthey were hacked out with a chisel in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that the Irish, who are brimful of shrewd sense, use no\r\nmore discretion about appointing schoolmasters than dispensary doctors.\r\n\r\nThe petty pedagogues, who are the Baboos of Ireland, are drawn from the\r\nsmall-farmer class. There is great competition among the incompetent to\r\nget lucrative posts in my native land: they probably appreciate the\r\nHibernian eccentricity of giving important positions to the men whose\r\nclaims in any other country would never obtain a moment's consideration.\r\n\r\nThere was a schoolmaster near Castleisland, who died of sparing the rod\r\nbut not sparing the potation. His family were anxious his nephew should\r\nbe appointed.\r\n\r\nAs he was an utter ne'er-do-weel, the parish priest justly considered\r\nhim unfit for the situation, and brought from a neighbouring county a\r\nschoolmaster highly recommended by the National Convention.\r\n\r\nThey had a quiet way of expressing their feelings in Kerry in those\r\ndays, and the moonlighters fired by night through the windows of every\r\none who sent their children to the nominee of the parish priest.\r\n\r\nThe District Inspector thought he had better look into the matter\r\nhimself, for it was stated they had always fired high with the sole\r\npurpose of intimidating the occupants of the various cabins.\r\n\r\nHowever, when this inspecting authority found a bullet-hole in a\r\nwindow-sill only three feet from the ground, he observed:--\r\n\r\n'Well, that shot was meant to kill.'\r\n\r\nOne farmer standing by remarked:--\r\n\r\n'It was not right to fire into a house where there were a lot of little\r\nchildren.'\r\n\r\n'Begorra,' cried another, in a tone of virtuous indignation, 'the\r\ncareless fellows might have killed the poor pig!'\r\n\r\nThat was sworn before me.\r\n\r\nHere is another incident, also sworn to in my presence.\r\n\r\nI must explain that the first poor rate was in 1848, and half was made\r\nup by local subscription, while the rent was added by the presentment of\r\nthe county, and not paid out of the rates. It was in those days a common\r\npractice for dispensary doctors to put down on the list imaginary\r\nsubscriptions from friends, so as to draw more from the county.\r\n\r\nA young fellow, whose name had thus been used, fired into a Protestant\r\ndoctor's house, and threatened to murder everybody unless he was given\r\nsome money.\r\n\r\nHe obtained half a crown, with which he bought a pint of whisky and a\r\nmutton pie; but just as he was putting his teeth into the crust of the\r\nlatter, he paused in horror.\r\n\r\n'I was near being lost for ever, body and soul,' says he, 'this being\r\nFriday, and me so close on tasting meat.'\r\n\r\nThe woman in the place where he bought the provisions proposed to keep\r\nthe mutton pie for him until the following day.\r\n\r\nHe thanked her civilly, and went away, but had the misfortune to mistake\r\nthe police barracks for the rival whisky store, and was promptly\r\narrested for threatening with intent to do injury.\r\n\r\nThe next day he asked to be allowed to eat his pie, which is how the\r\nstory came out.\r\n\r\nThe dispensaries are often worked with more attention to the pocket of\r\nthose on the premises than is compatible with the principles of honesty,\r\nas recognised outside the legal and medical professions. At one\r\ndispensary in Kerry the Local Government Board was horrified at the\r\nconsumption of quinine--an expensive medicine. Indeed, so much\r\ndisappeared that, if it had not been for the chronic aversion of any\r\nlow-born Irishman to outside applications of liquid, it might have been\r\nsurmised that the patients were taking quinine baths. The matter was\r\nprivately put into the hands of the police, who within a week arrested\r\nthe secretary getting out of a back window with a big bottle of quinine,\r\nwhich he meant to sell.\r\n\r\nThat man, for the rest of his life, inveighed against the petty and\r\nmischievous interference with private industry tyrannically waged by\r\npublic bodies.\r\n\r\nI should like to claim for Kerry the honour of being the land where the\r\nfollowing hoary chestnut originally was perpetrated, the exact locality\r\nbeing Castleisland.\r\n\r\nA landlord, who had returned in a fit of absent-mindedness to his\r\nproperty after a sojourn in England, was condoling with a woman on the\r\ndeath of her husband, and asked:--\r\n\r\n'What did he die of?'\r\n\r\n'Wishna, then, did he not die a natural death, your honour, for there\r\nwas no doctor attending him?'\r\n\r\nA not dissimilar story is that which concerns a Scotch laird who had\r\nfallen very sick, so a specialist came from Edinburgh to assist the\r\nlocal murderer in diagnosing the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe canny patient felt sure he would not be told what was the matter, so\r\nhe bade his servant conceal himself behind the curtains in the room\r\nwhere the doctors talked it over, and to repeat to him what they said.\r\n\r\nThis is what the faithful retainer brought as tidings of comfort to the\r\nalarmed invalid:--\r\n\r\n'Weel, sir, the two were very gloomy, one saying one thing and the other\r\nanother; but after a while they cheered up and grew quite pleasant when\r\nthey had decided that they would know all about it at the post-mortem.'\r\n\r\nThat recalls to my mind Sidney Smith's definition of a doctor as an\r\nindividual who put drugs of which he knew very little into a body of\r\nwhich he knew considerably less.\r\n\r\nThere is a rare lot of truth in some witticisms.\r\n\r\nFor some illogical reason only known to my own brain--perhaps with the\r\ndesire of keeping up the fashion for inconsecutive and rambling\r\nobservations common to all books of reminiscences--the foregoing stories\r\nsuggest to my mind the excuse made to me by a wary scoundrel for not\r\npaying his rent.\r\n\r\n'I had an illegant little heifer as ever your honour cast an eye over,\r\nand who is a better judge than yourself, God bless you? But the Lord was\r\npleased to take her to Himself, and it would be flat heresy for me not\r\nto say He is not as good a judge as your honour's self.'\r\n\r\nThere was an action brought against a veterinary surgeon for killing a\r\nman's horse.\r\n\r\nLord Morris knew something of medicine, as he did of most things, and\r\nasked if the dose given would not have killed the devil himself.\r\n\r\nThe vet. drew himself up pompously, and said:--\r\n\r\n'I never had the honour of attending that gentleman.'\r\n\r\n'That's a pity, doctor,' replied Morris, 'for he's alive still.'\r\n\r\nThe Government introduced into the House of Lords an additional bill for\r\nthe complication and confiscation of landed property in Ireland.\r\n\r\nLord Morris said it reminded him of the bill a veterinary surgeon sent\r\nin to a friend of his, the last item of which ran:--\r\n\r\n'To curing your grey mare till she died, 10s. 6d.'\r\n\r\nNever was the Irish question more happily expressed than in his famous\r\nreply to a lady who asked him if he could account for disaffection in\r\nIreland towards the English.\r\n\r\n'What else can you expect, ma'am, when a quick-witted race is governed\r\nby an intensely stupid one?'\r\n\r\nLord Morris told many stories, but for a change, here is one told of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA Belfast tourist was riding past Spiddal, and asked a countryman who\r\nlived there.\r\n\r\n'One Judge Morris, your honour; but he lives the best part of his time\r\nin Dublin.'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes,' says the other, 'that's Lord Chief Justice Morris.'\r\n\r\n'The very dead spit of him, your honour; and I was told he draws a\r\nthousand a year salary.'\r\n\r\n'He has five thousand five hundred a year.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, your honour, it's very hard to make me believe that.'\r\n\r\n'Why don't you believe it?'\r\n\r\n'Because when he's down here he passes my gate five days in the week,\r\nand I never saw the sign of liquor on him.'\r\n\r\nEvidently the bigger salary the bigger profit to the whisky distiller\r\nwas the rustic's theory.\r\n\r\nI have forgotten how the story came to my ears, but I told it to Lord\r\nMorris, who much appreciated it.\r\n\r\nAnother Kerry story, not unlike one narrated earlier in this chapter,\r\nruns thiswise:--\r\n\r\nTwo men came to order a coffin for a mutual friend called Tim\r\nO'Shaughnessy.\r\n\r\nSaid the undertaker:--\r\n\r\n'I am sorry to hear poor Tim is gone. He had a famous way with him of\r\ndrinking whisky. What did he die of?'\r\n\r\nReplied one of the men:--\r\n\r\n'He is not dead yet at all; but the doctor says he will be before the\r\nmorning; and sure he should know, for he knows what he gave him.'\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the patient is quite as clever as the doctor.\r\n\r\nA physician in Dublin had a telephone put in his bedroom, and when he\r\nwas rung up about half-past one on a freezing wintry night, he told his\r\nwife to answer it.\r\n\r\nShe complied, and informed him:--\r\n\r\n'It is Mr. Shamus O'Brien, and he wants you to come round at once.'\r\n\r\nThe physician knew this to be purely an imaginary case of illness, so\r\nnot wishing to be disturbed, said to her:--\r\n\r\n'Tell him the doctor is out, and will not be home till morning.'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately he spoke so near the telephone that his remark was audible\r\nto the patient. So when the wife had duly delivered the message, the\r\nanswer came back:--\r\n\r\n'If the man in your bed is a doctor, send him here.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nIRISH CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's the proudest boast of my life that I am an Irishman, and the\r\ncompliment which I have most appreciated in my time was being called\r\n'the poor man's friend,' for I love Paddy dearly though I see his\r\nfaults. Yes, perhaps one of the reasons why I love him is because I do\r\nsee the faults, for the errors of an Irishman are often almost as good\r\nas the virtues of an Englishman, and are far more diverting into the\r\nbargain. You must not judge Paddy by the same standard as you apply to\r\nJohn. To begin with, he has not had the advantages, and secondly,\r\nthere's an ingrained whimsicality, for which I would not exchange all\r\nthe solid imperfections of his neighbour across the Irish Channel.\r\n\r\nYou would not judge all Scotland by Glasgow, and so you should not fall\r\ninto the error of judging all Ireland by Belfast. Kerry is the jewel of\r\nIreland, and it is with Kerry that I have fortunately had most to do in\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am alluding to the mistake of generalising, let me point out\r\nhow erroneous it is ever, historically, to talk of Ireland as one\r\ncountry. When Henry II. annexed the whole land by a confiscation more\r\nopen but not more criminal than that instigated by Mr. Gladstone, there\r\nwere four perfectly separate kingdoms in the island. Now there are four\r\nprovinces which are quite distinct, and an Ulster man, or a Munster man,\r\nor a Connaught man, knows far more, as a rule, of England, or even\r\nScotland, than he does of the other three provinces of his native isle.\r\nFor one Ulster man who has been in Munster, three hundred have been to\r\nLiverpool or Greenock, and until lately there was no railway between\r\nConnaught and Munster, so that you had to go nearly up to Dublin to get\r\nfrom one to the other.\r\n\r\nThere is much that is incomprehensible to the Englishman who comes among\r\nus taking notes, and not the least is that no one wants his\r\ncut-and-dried schemes of reforming what we do not wish to reform. As for\r\nconforming to his method and rule by vestry and county council autocracy\r\nin a methodical manner, it is utterly at variance with the national\r\ntemperament. Very often, too, the stranger falls a victim to the\r\nIrishman's love of fun, and goes back hopelessly 'spoofed' and quite\r\nunaware what nonsense he is talking when he lays down the law on Ireland\r\nfar from that perplexing land.\r\n\r\n'Don't you want three acres and a cow?' asked an enthusiastic tourist\r\nfrom Birmingham, soon after Mr. Jesse Collins had provided the\r\nmusic-halls with the catch-phrase.\r\n\r\n'As for the cow I would not be after saying it would not be a comfort,\r\nbut what would the pig want with so much land?' was the peasant's reply.\r\n\r\nAnd that suggests an opportunity to give as my opinion that the most\r\npractical measure England could take to benefit Ireland would be to\r\ndrain the large bogs and so improve fuel. In some places the bogs are\r\nlikely to be exhausted, but in others there is plenty of turf (turf, O\r\nSaxon, is not the grass on which you play cricket or croquet, but is the\r\nHibernian for peat). Indeed, there is ample for all the needs of Ireland\r\nfor a hundred years to come, but it should not be used in the shamefully\r\nwasteful way so often noticeable. It is no excuse that the heat it\r\ncontains is not so great as in coal.\r\n\r\nIf coal were to run out in England, to what a premium would turf rise in\r\nIreland!\r\n\r\nFormerly turf could be picked up free, and even now it is very cheap,\r\nthe chief expense to the consumer being the cost of transport from the\r\nbog to the turf rick behind the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe mineral rights of Ireland are most deceptive. There are plenty of\r\nindications of minerals, but they are of too poor a nature to warrant\r\nworking.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I tried working coal-pits near Castleisland for three\r\nmonths, and silver lead was worked for six months near Tralee by a\r\ncompany which was more successful in working its own way with the\r\nbankruptcy court. I firmly believe the reputed mineral wealth of Ireland\r\nto be greatly exaggerated, and should never advise any one to invest\r\nmoney in a syndicate for its discovery. Smelting was largely perpetrated\r\nin olden times in Ireland, which entailed cutting down the oak forests,\r\nthat then crossed the country, to obtain fuel, the ore being brought\r\nfrom England. But the introduction of the coke process in the north of\r\nEngland settled that industry, which was one of the earliest Irish ones\r\ndoomed to extinction.\r\n\r\nAn Irish industry which as yet shows no sign of losing its commercial\r\nimportance is the blessed institution of matrimony, a holy thing which\r\nin Ireland is particularly beneficial to the pockets of the priest, who\r\npronounces the blessing, and to the distiller, who sells the whisky, in\r\nwhich the future of the happy pair is pledged.\r\n\r\nThe matrimonial arrangements of Irish farmers in Kerry may sound queer\r\nto an English reader, but are the outcome of an innate, though\r\nunwritten, law that the whole family have a vested interest in the\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the family is growing up, the farm is handed over to\r\nthe eldest son, who gives the parents a small allowance during their\r\nlives, while the fortune that he gets with his wife goes, not to\r\nhimself, but to provide for his younger brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nHence, if the eldest son were to marry the Venus de Medici with ten\r\npounds less dowry than he could get with the ugliest wall-eyed female in\r\nthe neighbourhood, he would be considered as an enemy to all his family.\r\n\r\nA tenant of a neighbour of mine actually got married to a woman without\r\na penny, a thing unparalleled in my experience in Kerry, and his sister\r\npresently came to my wife for some assistance.\r\n\r\nMy wife asked her:--\r\n\r\n'Why does not your brother support you?'\r\n\r\nAnd she was answered:--\r\n\r\n'How could he support any one after bringing an empty woman to the\r\nhouse?'\r\n\r\nThere was a tenant of mine, paying about twenty-five pounds a year rent,\r\nwho died, and his son came to me to have his name inscribed in the rent\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nI asked him what will his father had made.\r\n\r\nHe replied that he had left him the farm and its stock.\r\n\r\n'What's to become of your brother and sister?' says I.\r\n\r\n'They are to get whatever I draw,' says he.\r\n\r\n'That means whatever you get with your wife?'\r\n\r\n'That is so.'\r\n\r\n'Well, suppose you marry a girl worth only twenty pounds, what would\r\nhappen then?'\r\n\r\n'That would not do at all,' very gravely.\r\n\r\n'Is there no limit put on the worth of your wife?'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' says he, 'I was valued at one hundred and sixty pounds.'\r\n\r\nI found out afterwards he had one hundred and seventy with his wife.\r\n\r\nA tenant on the Callinafercy estate got married, and the mother-in-law\r\nand the daughter-in-law did not agree. So the elder came to complain to\r\nthe landlord of the girl's conduct, and after copiously describing\r\nvarious delinquencies with the assistance of many invocations of the\r\nsaints, she wound up with:--\r\n\r\n'And the worst of all, Mr. Marshall, is that she gives herself all the\r\nairs of a three hundred pound girl and she had but a hundred and fifty.'\r\n\r\nFilial obedience in the matter of marriage is as uniform in these\r\nclasses in Kerry as it is conspicuous by its absence in old English\r\nnovels and comedies. The sons never kick at the unions, the daughters\r\nare never hauled weeping to the altar, while an elopement or a refusal\r\nto fulfil a matrimonial engagement would arouse the indignation of the\r\nwhole country side.\r\n\r\nDecidedly these marriages turn out better than the made-up marriages in\r\nFrance. I will go further, and seriously affirm my belief that the\r\nmarriages in Kerry show a greater average of happiness than any which\r\ncan be mentioned. To be sure there is the same dash after heiresses in\r\nKerry that you see in Mayfair, and the young farmer who is really\r\nwell-to-do is as much pursued as the heir to an earldom by matchmaking\r\nmothers in Belgravia. But the subsequent results are much more\r\nharmonious in Kerry, and though the landlord's advice is often asked to\r\nsettle financial difficulties in carrying out the matrimonial bargains,\r\nless frequently is he called upon to settle differences between man and\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n'Sure, he's well enough meaning, your honour, with what brains the\r\nBlessed Virgin could spare for him,' is the sort of remark a wife will\r\nmake on behalf of her lazy husband.\r\n\r\nFidelity is the rule; so is reasonable give and take, though each, being\r\nhuman, likes to receive better than to give. And one thing which\r\nimpresses a stranger is the rarity of illegitimate children out of the\r\ntowns. This is, of course, partly due to the influence of the priests,\r\nbut partly also to the innate purity of the Irish character, as well as\r\nby the standard of respectability:--\r\n\r\n'Ah, he's a strong man,' you will hear said of So-and-So.\r\n\r\n'How do you prove that?' says I.\r\n\r\n'Why, has he not his farm, and his family with one son a priest, and one\r\ndaughter in a convent, and he with a bull for his own cows?'\r\n\r\nCould you want more to get him on the County Council if he has no\r\nconscience and a convivial taste in the matter of whisky?\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Irish take better care of their children\r\nthan the parents of similar position in either England or Scotland.\r\nCases of cruelty, which so constantly disfigure the police courts in\r\nboth the latter countries, are very rarely heard in the sister isle.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in many cases they cannot do much for their offspring,\r\nbut what little they are able to do is done with a good will and\r\nungrudgingly.\r\n\r\nI remember a Saharan explorer telling me that in the desert he came\r\nacross some tribe, stark naked, utterly poor, but all on apparently\r\naffectionate terms. He was much impressed with the love shown by the\r\nchildren of all ages for their parents, and inquired what the latter did\r\nto inspire such enviable emotion.\r\n\r\n'We give them a handful of dates, when there are any.'\r\n\r\nIt was apparently their sole form of sustenance.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman is very good to his wife, although the courting is a matter\r\nof business, as I have shown. Wife-beating and even more ignoble forms\r\nof marital cruelty are almost unknown.\r\n\r\nThis is surely a big national asset.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Irish are a very moral people; and this in spite of the\r\nclose proximity and confinement necessitated by the crowded condition of\r\nmany cabins.\r\n\r\nI was going to add that the light food may have something to say to\r\nthis, but as the Irish are not remarkable for their small families, this\r\nwould be an unwarrantable aspersion.\r\n\r\nOf course in the big towns there are women of no importance, and Dublin\r\nhas always borne rather a lively reputation in this respect, though that\r\nin no way affects the general high standard of morality.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the country, despite the moisture, is one conducive to\r\ngood health, owing to the absence of any extreme vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why, considering the overcrowding and insanitary\r\nconditions of living in the miserable cabins, there is not more disease,\r\nand my reply is that the peat which is burnt is so healthy as to act as\r\na disinfectant.\r\n\r\nIndigestion, like lunacy, is, however, largely on the increase.\r\n\r\nNearly any old woman--or old man for the matter of that--as well as a\r\nsad majority of younger people, will tell you:--\r\n\r\n'I have a pain in the stomach,' with the accent on the second syllable\r\nof the locality.\r\n\r\nThis is due to excessive consumption of tea.\r\n\r\nNearly twenty times as much tea must be drunk now in Kerry as in the\r\nearly sixties, and so far as I can recollect tea was unknown, not only\r\nin the cabins but among the farmers until after the famine.\r\n\r\nFairly good tea is obtained, for the Irish will never buy tea unless\r\nthey are asked a high price, and for that price they usually, owing to\r\ncompetition, obtain an article not too perniciously adulterated.\r\n\r\nWhat is highly injurious is the method of making the tea.\r\n\r\nA lot is thrown into the pot on the fire in the cabin in the morning,\r\nand there it stands simmering all day long, that those who want it may\r\nhelp themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is in sharp contrast to the method employed by Dr. Barter, the\r\nfamous hydropathic physician at Cork, one of the cleverest men I ever\r\nmet and one of the very few who never permitted medicine under any\r\ncircumstances, relying on water, packing, and Turkish baths, with strict\r\nattention to diet.\r\n\r\nHe used to make tea by putting half a teaspoonful into a wire strainer\r\nwhich he held over his cup, and pouring boiling water upon the leaves,\r\nthe contents of his cup became a pale yellow, to which he added a little\r\nmilk and instantly drank it off, the whole process lasting but a few\r\nseconds. I remember he equally disapproved of the Russian method of\r\ndrinking tea in a glass with lemon, of the fashionable way of letting\r\nthe water 'stand off the boil' upon the leaves in a teapot, and of the\r\nHibernian stewing arrangement alluded to above.\r\n\r\nPersonally I regard all hydros as so many emporiums of disease, an\r\nopinion in which I am singular, but that does not convince me I am\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nA bailiff once went to St. Ann's Hydro to serve a writ, and he told me\r\nafterwards that he served it on his victim in a Turkish bath,\r\nremarking:--\r\n\r\n'And your heart would have melted within your honour in pity for the\r\npoor creature not having a pocket to put the document in.'\r\n\r\nWhich observation recalls to my mind the story of a gentleman in a\r\nTurkish bath asking a friend to dinner, and saying:--\r\n\r\n'Don't mind dressing; come just as you are.'\r\n\r\nAnother misunderstood answer was that of the absent-minded man who\r\nentered a hansom and began to read a paper.\r\n\r\n'Where to?' at last cabby asked laconically.\r\n\r\n'Drive to the usual place.'\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid I have too much on the slate there, sir, unless you pay my\r\nfooting.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, go to hell,' retorted the other in a rage.\r\n\r\n'It's outside the radius, sir, and it will be a steep pull for my old\r\nhorse after we've dropped you.'\r\n\r\nThe light-heartedness of the Celt is another feature which strikes the\r\nleast observant stranger.\r\n\r\nAn Irishman has been described as a man who confided his soul to the\r\npriest, and his body to the British Government, whilst he holds himself\r\ndevoid of any vestige of responsibility for the care of either.\r\n\r\nHere is another tale, illustrative of his contentment.\r\n\r\nA philosopher, in search of happiness, was told by a wise man that if he\r\ngot the shirt of a perfectly happy man and put it on, he would himself\r\nbecome happy.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher wandered over the world, but could find no man whose\r\nhappiness had not some flaw, until he fell in with an Irishman; with\r\nwhom he promptly began to bargain for his shirt, only to find he had not\r\none to his back.\r\n\r\nFrom philosophy to the deuce is not a big stride, according to the view\r\nof those folk who jibe at political economy and all the abstract of\r\nvirtues and governments. So, on the tail of their fancy, I am reminded\r\nof another story about the devil--a very large number of Irish stories\r\nare connected with him, because in a very special sense he is the\r\nunauthorised patron saint of the sinners of the country, and he has had\r\nfar too much to say to its government into the bargain.\r\n\r\nAn Englishman, in the witless way in which Saxons do address Irishmen,\r\nasked a labourer by the wayside:--\r\n\r\n'If the devil came by, do you think he would take me or you?'\r\n\r\nThe labourer never hesitated, but replied:--\r\n\r\n'He'd take me, your honour.'\r\n\r\n'Why do you say that?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, he would,' says he, 'because he's sure of your honour at any time.'\r\n\r\nThe Irishman is not so black as he may seem to the Saxon, who reads with\r\ndisgust the horrors that mar the beauty of the Emerald Isle, and I\r\nshould say that his finest trait is patience under adversity. No nation,\r\nfor example, could have more calmly endured the terrible sufferings of\r\nthe famine, more especially as the high-strung nerves of the Celt render\r\nhim physically and mentally the very reverse of a stoic.\r\n\r\nAgain, in no other nation are the family ties closer.\r\n\r\nThe first thought of those who emigrate to America is to remit money to\r\nthe old folk in the cabin at home. So soon as the emigrants have\r\nobtained a reasonable degree of comfort they will send home the passage\r\nmoney to pay for bringing out younger brothers or sisters to them.\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear the story of the homesick Kerry undergraduate at\r\nOxford, at his first construe with his tutor, translating _contiguare\r\nomnes_ as 'all of them County Kerry men'?\r\n\r\nIt was a true home touch, though not exactly a classical reading of the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, in my boyish days at Dingle, we all of us firmly\r\nbelieved that King John had asked in what part of Kerry Ireland was.\r\nThat question was our local Magna Charta, though what the origin of the\r\ntradition was I have no idea.\r\n\r\nBut then things do differ according to the point of view, and ours of\r\nhistory was not stranger than many others of far more importance.\r\n\r\nAs an example of lack of comprehension I would cite the following\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nAn English gentleman was shooting grouse in Ireland. He got very few\r\nbirds, and said to the keeper:--\r\n\r\n'Why, these actually cost me a pound apiece.'\r\n\r\n'Begorra, your honour, it's lucky there are not more of them,' was the\r\nunexpected answer.\r\n\r\nThis allusion to sport reminds me of the Frenchman's description of\r\nhunting in Ireland, which was to the effect that about thirty horsemen\r\nand sixty dogs chased a wretched little animal ten miles, which resulted\r\nin seven casualties, and when they caught the poor beast not one of them\r\nwould eat him.\r\n\r\nThe French do not always appreciate our institutions. One of them\r\nlanding at Queenstown in the middle of the day asked if there was\r\nanything he could amuse himself with between then and dinner-time.\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' said the waiter; 'which would you like, wine or spirits?'\r\n\r\nBy way of amusing the reader, before going any further, I will give him\r\na chance of reading a genuine, but unique testament in which I figured,\r\nand which is not a bit more queer than many which have been as formally\r\nproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n'I Robert Shanahan in my last will and testament do make my wife\r\nMargaret Shanahan Manager or guardian over my farm and means provided\r\nshe remains unmarried if she do not I bequeath to her 2 shillings and\r\nsixpence I leave the farm to my son Thomas Shanahan provided he conducts\r\nhimself if not I leave the farm to my son Robert Shanahan I also wish\r\nthat there should be a provision made for the rest of the family out of\r\nthe farm according as the following Executors which I appoint may think\r\nfit Mr. Hussey Esq. Revd. Brusnan P.P. and James Casey of Gorneybee.\r\nGiven under my heand this 7th day of February 1872.\r\n\r\n                                               his\r\n\r\n                                         ROBERT X SHANAHAN.\r\n\r\n                                              mark\r\n\r\nWitnessed by\r\n  JOHN O'BRIEN.\r\n  JEREMIAH CONNOR.'\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a few tales to tell of Kerry landlords, a race who would have\r\nfurnished Lever with a worthy theme, men as humorous as they are brave,\r\nas diverting as they can stand, loyal to the Crown despite much\r\ndisparagement, and proud to be Irishmen, though so unappreciated by the\r\npaid agitators and their weak tools.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I wish to be on good terms with all my neighbours in this\r\nworld, and with the ghosts of the departed ones when I meet them in the\r\nnext, I am not going to give many names or rub up susceptibilities.\r\n\r\nOf Kerry landlords, Lord Kenmare naturally suggests himself to be first\r\nmentioned. He has been somewhat unjustly attacked more than once about\r\nthe condition of Killarney as though the town was his private property.\r\nAs a matter of fact, he is utterly powerless there, as it was all leased\r\naway for five hundred years by his grandfather. About the town the\r\nfollowing may be worth telling:--\r\n\r\nA very neat plan was drawn up for improving it, which included a gateway\r\nbetween every double block of houses to lead down to the stables and\r\ngarden, but as it was not thought necessary to put a subletting clause\r\ninto the lease, the actual consequence was that all these passages were\r\nconverted into filthy lanes. Outside the town Lord Kenmare has built\r\nsome nice cottages, but within its confines he could effect nothing.\r\n\r\nTo show you how short-lived is Irish gratitude, ponder over this:--\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Daniel O'Connell, son of the great Dan, stood for West Kerry as\r\na Unionist, he was warned by the police officer that he could not be\r\nanswerable for his life if he came into Cahirciveen, for he had only\r\ntwenty constables to protect him; and his wife--a most charming\r\nwoman--when driving through the town was surrounded by an insulting mob,\r\nmembers of which actually spat in her face.\r\n\r\nThat reminds me of a similar experience which befell the wife of Mr.\r\nCavanagh, the man without arms and legs, who, until denounced by the\r\nLand League, was exceptionally popular.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cavanagh was walking along the road in Carlow carrying broth and\r\nwine to a poor sick woman, when she found herself the target for a\r\nnumber of stones and had to run for her life amid a shower of missiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite his exceptional infirmities Mr. Cavanagh could do almost\r\nanything. He used to ride most pluckily to hounds, strapped on to his\r\nsaddle. On one occasion the saddle turned under him, and the horse\r\ntrotted back to the stable-yard, with his master hanging under him, his\r\nhair sweeping the ground, bleeding profusely; he merely cursed the groom\r\nwith emphatic volubility, had himself more safely readjusted, and then\r\nrode out once more.\r\n\r\nHe always wore pink when hunting. One day a pretty child of ten years\r\nold was out with her groom, who followed the scent so ardently, that he\r\nforgot all about his charge, who was left behind, and finding herself\r\nlost in a wood, began to cry.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there swooped out on a very big horse, the armless and legless\r\nfigure of Cavanagh in his flaming coat, and seeing her predicament, he\r\nseized her rein somehow--she never seems quite clear how--saying:--\r\n\r\n'Don't be frightened, little girl, for I know who you are, and will take\r\ncare of you.'\r\n\r\nHe was as good as his word, but the high-strung, sensitive child, so\r\nsoon as she was in her mother's embrace, went from one fit of hysterics\r\nto another, crying:--\r\n\r\n'Oh, mummy, I've seen the devil, I've seen the devil.'\r\n\r\nIn after years they became great friends, and he often dined with her\r\nafter she married and settled in London.\r\n\r\nReverting to Lord Kenmare, the following story, which in another version\r\nrecently won a railway story competition in some newspaper, really\r\npertains to his son Lord Castlerosse.\r\n\r\nOn a line in Kerry there is a sharp curve overhanging the sea. An old\r\nwoman in a great state of nervous agitation was bundled at the last\r\nmoment into a first-class compartment.\r\n\r\nLord Castlerosse, the only passenger in the compartment, by way of\r\nrelieving her obvious agitation, tried to calm her by telling her she\r\ncould change at the next station.\r\n\r\n'Is it me that can be aisy,' she replied, 'when it's my Pat is driving\r\nthe engine, and him having a dhrop taken, and saying he'll take us a\r\nshpin round the Head?'\r\n\r\nAfter all, to my mind, for sheer humour of a quiet sort, nothing beats\r\nthe observation of the late Sir John Godfrey, who never got up before\r\none in the day, and invariably breakfasted when his family were having\r\nlunch. Being asked one day to account for this rather inconvenient\r\nhabit, he replied:--\r\n\r\n'The fact is, I sleep very slow.'\r\n\r\nI commend this to every sluggard who wants an excuse to resume his\r\nslumbers when awakened too soon.\r\n\r\nThere was a gentleman who had rather a red nose, and some one remarked\r\nthat it was an expensive piece of painting, to which some one else\r\nsignificantly added, that it was not a water-colour.\r\n\r\n'No,' said Sir John, 'it was done in distemper.'\r\n\r\nOne night a landlord in Kerry, who shall be nameless, though he has\r\npassed over to the great majority, went to bed without having much\r\nknowledge how he got there.\r\n\r\nTwo of his sons crept to the neighbouring town, unscrewed the sign\r\noutside the inn, and put it at the end of their parent's bed.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, he looked at the sign for some time in a bewildered way.\r\nThen he observed aloud:--\r\n\r\n'I thought I went to sleep in my own bed, but I'm d----d if I have not\r\nwoke in the middle of the street.'\r\n\r\nA certain roystering gentleman named Jack Ray got drunk and fell asleep\r\nin the woods of Kilcoleman. Some of the Godfrey boys, seeing him\r\nprostrate and with foam on his lips, ran to summon their father, saying\r\nto him:--\r\n\r\n'There's a man dead in the wood.'\r\n\r\nSir William hastened to the spot, and having put on his glasses to get a\r\nview of the corpse, observed:--\r\n\r\n'Come away, my boys, this man dies once a week.'\r\n\r\nAnother Kerry landlord, who was also a baronet, dealt with the National\r\nBank, the local manager of which was an arrant snob, who loved a title,\r\nand bored everybody with his pretended intimacy with the impecunious\r\nbaronet. But at last even his patience was exhausted, and he sent the\r\nsquire a pretty stiff letter about the arrears due.\r\n\r\nThe other received the letter at breakfast, and showed it to his son\r\njust come down from a University, who whistled and ejaculated:--\r\n\r\n'O tempora! O mores!'\r\n\r\nHis father instantly retorted:--\r\n\r\n'You get me the temporary, and I'll promptly see we have more ease.'\r\n\r\nIn the bad times, an old woman came into the office at Tralee to pay her\r\nrent. Mr. Francis Denny was in a real bad humour with somebody else who\r\nhad defaulted, and he was raging along in a manner qualified to display\r\nhis intimate acquaintance with the florid embellishments of the\r\nlanguage. The old woman listened with evident admiration for some time.\r\nAt last she ejaculated:--\r\n\r\n'Ah, the nate little man.'\r\n\r\nAnd with that slipped out, without settling her account.\r\n\r\nMr. Francis Denny has the misfortune to be rather lame, and one day\r\nanother old woman, who liked him, observed:--\r\n\r\n'If he had two sound legs under him, there'd be no holding him in\r\nTralee, but he'd be up at the Castle setting the Lord Lieutenant right\r\nin his many errors, not to mention going over to London to give the\r\nQueen herself a bit of his mind.'\r\n\r\nIn the bad times, one lady was left in her Kerry residence with her baby\r\nboy and a pack of maidservants, her husband having been called over to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nShe had sixty pounds of gold in her bedroom, and one night a housemaid\r\nrushed in to say a party of moonlighters were in the house.\r\n\r\nThe lady threw a sovereign and some silver on to the dressing-table, and\r\nhid the rest under her mattress.\r\n\r\nIn came the masked scoundrels asking for gold, and when she pointed to\r\nthe money that was visible, one replied that it was not enough.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' she said, 'give me your name and I'll write you a cheque.'\r\n\r\nOn that they left precipitately, to her intense relief.\r\n\r\nAll moonlighters calculated upon the terrorism their appearance would\r\ncause, and if this was apparently conspicuous by its absence they were\r\nnonplussed, because they never felt over secure in their own hearts at\r\nthe best of times, and grew frightened directly others were not\r\nfrightened by them.\r\n\r\nIn all moonlighting affrays no one scoundrel ever became personally\r\nconspicuous as a leader, and all the wisest leaders, such as Stephens,\r\nTynan, and Parnell, shrouded their movements in mystery. Fenianism in\r\nIreland since Emmett has never had one capable leader possessing the\r\nphysical courage to show himself in the forefront on all occasions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is a singular fact that nearly every general of\r\nnote in the army of the United Kingdom, since the time of Marlborough,\r\nhas come from Ireland. The Duke of Wellington was born in County Meath,\r\nLord Gough in Tipperary, Lord Wolseley in County Carlow, Lord Roberts in\r\nWaterford, Sir George White in Antrim, General French in Roscommon, and\r\nLord Kitchener in Kerry.\r\n\r\nThe attempts of the English Government to manufacture an English general\r\nin the South African war were a miserable fiasco. They only produced\r\none, Sir Charles Tucker, and he did his best to atone for the accident\r\nof his English birth by marrying a Kerry lady.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of meeting Sir Redvers Buller in Killarney, and after\r\nhe had been there a couple of days he proceeded to describe Kerry to me,\r\nwho had been managing one fifth of it for several years. His\r\nagricultural reforms would have been as drastic as they were ludicrous\r\nhad any one attempted to carry them out, but when expatiating on them to\r\nme, he was not even aware that there was any difference between an\r\nEnglish and an Irish acre. When I heard that he was taking charge of the\r\nwhole army in South Africa, I mentioned that as he had been unable to\r\ncommand three hundred constabulary in Kerry, I was sceptical of his\r\nability to manage the British army. He was without exception the most\r\nself-sufficient soldier I ever met, and his subsequent career has not\r\nmade me change my view.\r\n\r\nHere is a soldier story which is mighty illustrative of Irish traits.\r\n\r\nA peasant's son in Limerick enlisted in the militia for a month's\r\ntraining, for which he received a bounty of three pounds. With part of\r\nthis money he bought a pig and gave it to his father to feed up. When\r\nthe pig was fattened, the father sold it and declined to give him the\r\nprice. So the son was seen by the police to take his father by the\r\nthroat, saying:--\r\n\r\n'Bad luck to you, old reprobate, do you want to deprive me of my pig\r\nthat I risked my life for in the British Army?'\r\n\r\nEverywhere I like to slip into this book instances of the injuries\r\nsuffered by Irish landlords, so here is another case _à propos des\r\nbottes_, if you will forgive it.\r\n\r\nThe Knight of Kerry let nine acres of land to a tenant for a rent of\r\nforty-five pounds. Having expended a large sum of money in roadmaking\r\nand fences, at the tenant's request, he also borrowed thirty-five pounds\r\nto build a small house for which he has to pay thirty-five shillings per\r\nannum. The commissioners cut down the rent so heavily, that it has\r\nresulted in the landlord having to pay five shillings a year for the\r\npleasure of looking at the man in occupation of his land.\r\n\r\nReverting to my reminiscences--or rather to what are for myself less\r\ninteresting portions, for I am a land agent by profession and an\r\nanecdotist only by habit--I remember that an Englishman subsequently a\r\nPasha commanded the coastguard at Dingle in 1856, and then had an\r\nencounter with a local Justice of the Peace in which he came off second\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nCaptain ---- occupied the Grove demesne. The J.P., who had been a Scotch\r\nmilitia officer, had been in the habit of shooting crows over the\r\ndemesne, and continued to enjoy the sport, to which the Captain strongly\r\nobjected. After an angry correspondence the J.P. sent a challenge, which\r\nthe other did not seem to stomach, for he sent an apology by a\r\nsubordinate with full permission to continue the immolation of the\r\nbirds. If a cruiser had to capitulate to this bold blockade runner, the\r\nCaptain himself had to endure a similar humiliation at the hands of an\r\nindignant Kerry man, though he was very popular in Dingle.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing pusillanimous about the Irishman, except when in cold\r\nblood he was expected to attack an agent, or landlord, or policeman,\r\narmed to the teeth. In such cases, he remembered that his parents, by\r\nthe blessing of the Holy Virgin, had endowed him with two legs, and only\r\none skin, which latter must therefore be saved by the discretionary\r\nemployment of the former.\r\n\r\nIn other cases he is very brave, especially in verbal encounters.\r\nFighting is in his blood. That is what makes the Irish soldier the best\r\nin the world, and that was why he used to revel in the faction fights.\r\nAs a paternal Government now prevents the breaking of heads, at all\r\nevents on a wholesale scale, the pugnacious instincts of the nation have\r\nto be gratified by litigation, and certainly there never was such a\r\nlitigious race in history as the contemporary Ireland.\r\n\r\nI know of a case on the Callinafercy estate, where a widow spent fifty\r\npounds 'in getting the law of' a neighbour whose donkey had browsed on\r\nher side of a hedge. She took the case to the assizes, and when the\r\njudge heard Mr. Leeson Marshall was her landlord, he said:--\r\n\r\n'Let him decide it. He's a barrister himself, and can judge far better\r\nthan I could on such a subject.'\r\n\r\nTo this there are literally hundreds of parallels every year. Readers of\r\n_La Terre_ will remember how much of the funds went into the hands of\r\nthe lawyer who thrived on the animosities of the family, and that sort\r\nof thing is constantly reduplicated in Kerry.\r\n\r\n'I'd sell my last cow to appeal on a point of law,' I once heard a\r\nKillorgin farmer say; and that is typical of all the lower classes in\r\nthe South and West.\r\n\r\nAs for the solicitors, I am not going to say a word about them, good or\r\nbad: there are men no doubt worthy of either epithet in a profession\r\nthat preys on the troubles of other folk. But I will tell one very brief\r\nstory on the topic.\r\n\r\nOutside the Four Courts, a poor woman stopped Daniel O'Connell,\r\nsaying:--\r\n\r\n'If you please, your honour, will you direct me to an honest attorney?'\r\n\r\nThe Liberator pushed back his wig and scratched his head.\r\n\r\n'Well now, you beat me entirely, ma'am,' was his answer.\r\n\r\nHe had more experience than me, being one.\r\n\r\nTalking of the Four Courts reminds me of Chief Baron Guillamore, who had\r\nas much wit as will provoke 'laughter in court,' and a trifle over that\r\ninfinitesimal quantity as well.\r\n\r\nA new Act of Parliament had been passed to prevent people from stealing\r\ntimber. A stupid juryman asked if he could prosecute a man under that\r\nact for stealing turnips.\r\n\r\n'Certainly not, unless they are very sticky,' retorted the judge.\r\n\r\nHis brother was a magistrate, and committed a barrister in petty\r\nsessions for contempt of court. An action was brought against him, but\r\nthe Chief Baron raised so many legal exceptions, that it had finally to\r\nbe abandoned through the fraternal law-moulding. This action was pending\r\nin the civil court, when a lawyer was very impertinent to the Chief\r\nBaron in the criminal. Instead of committing him, the Chief Baron said\r\nvery quietly:--\r\n\r\n'If you do not keep quiet, I shall send to the next Court for my\r\nbrother.'\r\n\r\nAnother judge had applied for shares in a company of which a friend of\r\nhis was secretary. Meeting him in Sackville Street, he stopped him to\r\ninquire what would be the paid-up capital of the concern.\r\n\r\nThe other forgot whom he was addressing, and blurted out the truth by\r\nreplying:--\r\n\r\n'Well, I really cannot tell you just yet, but the cheques are coming in\r\nfast.'\r\n\r\nThe judge withdrew his application by the next post, and confidently\r\nexpected to see his friend in the dock. I believe in less than six\r\nmonths he was not disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe poorer class in Ireland do not appear to be business-like in the\r\nordinary sense, however much they may develop commercial instincts after\r\nemigrating. It is to promote the latent capacity obviously within their\r\npower that creameries and other assisted promotions have been started in\r\nvarious parts of the country, sometimes with great success. Sir Horace\r\nPlunkett and others have dealt with all this in the most serious spirit.\r\nI prefer to allude to it, and add one anecdote.\r\n\r\nA lady asked a respectable old woman how her son was getting on as\r\nmanager of the creamery, and the reply came after the following\r\nfashion:--\r\n\r\n'Whisna the poor man and all the trouble he has, and him never able to\r\nmake the butter and the books scoromund,' which, being translated, is\r\n'correspond.'\r\n\r\nAnother example I can cite of the difficulty in getting people to put\r\ntheir intelligence to practical use in the south is to this effect:--\r\n\r\nThere was a certain widdy woman in a neighbouring parish who was making\r\ngreat lamentation over her 'pitaties' to the priest, and in consequence\r\nhe lent her a machine for the purpose of spraying them. She professed\r\nthe profoundest gratitude as well as interest in the implement, but the\r\ntask speedily became too big an effort, for she subsequently informed me\r\nthat she had sprayed 'half the field to plase his Rivirence, but left\r\nthe rest to God.'\r\n\r\nAnd that is the kind of negative piety which is distinctly a\r\ncharacteristic Irish trait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLORD-LIEUTENANTS AND CHIEF SECRETARIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAny Irishman who has reached the shady side of threescore years and ten\r\nmust remember many Lord-Lieutenants--the pompously visible symbols of\r\nmuch vacillating misdirection.\r\n\r\nTo analyse them would be the work of an historian, to criticise would be\r\nsuperfluous. They have been so many Malvolios, all alike anxious to win\r\nthe favour of that capricious Lady Olivia Erin, and not one of them has\r\nsucceeded, though several have merited better fortune than they met with\r\non Irish soil.\r\n\r\nThe first Lord-Lieutenant I personally met was Lord Carlisle.\r\n\r\nHe was a gentleman, but not otherwise remarkable. He had come into the\r\nGovernment on the resignation of the Peelites, and his popularity in\r\nIreland was greater than any other holder of the post in the century,\r\npossibly owing to his negative qualities, and also to a charm of manner\r\nmore effusive than usual among Englishmen.\r\n\r\nHe had a habit of dropping his state, and going about Dublin, if not\r\nlike Haroun Alraschid, at least with the independence of men in less\r\naugust positions.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, needing some local information, he went to see the Lord\r\nMayor of Dublin, but finding him out, was given the address of an\r\nalderman who could tell him what he wanted to know.\r\n\r\nThe alderman was not in either, but his wife was, and begged him to stop\r\nto lunch, which was just being served.\r\n\r\nLord Carlisle told her he hardly ever ate lunch, and was not in the\r\nleast hungry.\r\n\r\nBut under pressure he sat down to the meal, and got on very well with\r\nit, whereat the lady remarked:--\r\n\r\n'You see, your Excellency, eating is like scratching: when you once\r\nbegin it is hard to stop.'\r\n\r\nHis predecessor, Lord Clarendon, had been in office when Lord John\r\nRussell, the Prime Minister, urged on the House of Commons a bill for\r\nthe abolition of the Lord-Lieutenancy. The great point that he made was\r\nthat the Chief Secretary might become a mayor of the viceregal palace, a\r\nthing that has now long been the case, for the Lord-Lieutenant has to be\r\na plutocrat of high descent, and the Chief Secretary is the virtual\r\nadministrator of Ireland--a thing unknown, however, until the advent of\r\nMr. Foster. The second reading was carried by a majority of over a\r\nhundred and fifty, but it was then dropped.\r\n\r\nThe story went that the Duke of Wellington had suggested to Prince\r\nAlbert the possible diminution of respect for the Crown in Ireland\r\nwithout a visible representative, and the Teutonic mind could not endure\r\nsuch a notion.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon upheld the dignity of his position, though he was liked\r\nby neither party in Ireland. He is the only Lord-Lieutenant who ever\r\nadministered sharp discipline to the Orangemen--who regard their loyalty\r\nas permitting them a good deal of licence--for he removed the name of\r\ntheir leader, Lord Roden, from the Commission of the Peace because he\r\nencouraged a turbulent procession at Dolly's Brae. With his pompous\r\nmanner he made a very Brummagem monarch, quite indifferent to his\r\nunpopularity. As a matter of fact, some allege that all Lord-Lieutenants\r\nare hated by the disloyal section of the populace, and if they go\r\nthrough the farce of currying popularity, they can only do so by largely\r\npatronising about a dozen shopkeepers, who eventually curse because yet\r\nmore has not been spent. But this is altogether too limited to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Kimberley followed Lord Carlisle. In those days he was Lord\r\nWodehouse, and the Fenians used to issue mock proclamations, in ridicule\r\nof his, signed 'Woodlouse.' He was an experienced parliamentarian--a man\r\nwho held office for many years, and worked conscientiously, according to\r\nhis lights.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland he always appeared to be a naturalist, perplexed at not\r\nunderstanding the species among which his lot was for the time cast.\r\n\r\nHis mother was subsequently married to Mr. Crosbie Moore, and she ran\r\naway with Colonel Fitz-Gibbon, afterwards Lord Clare.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosbie Moore had not much sense of humour, as the following tale\r\nwill show.\r\n\r\nHe was presiding at Ballyporeen Petty Sessions, when a village tailor\r\nwas summoned for having his pig wandering on the road.\r\n\r\nThe fellow pleaded that it was due to great curiosity on the part of the\r\npig, who saw some constabulary passing by, and rushed out to see what\r\nthey were like.\r\n\r\nHe made this explanation in such humorous fashion that most of the\r\nmagistrates were for letting him off; but Mr. Crosbie Moore said it was\r\nscandalous that they had directed the police to summon people on that\r\nvery ground, and they wanted to acquit the culprit because he had made a\r\njoke.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Bench had to acquiesce, and the tailor was fined one\r\nshilling.\r\n\r\nHe paid his shilling, and said:--\r\n\r\n'I have no blame to you at all, gentlemen, except to Mr. Crosbie Moore;\r\nand, indeed, if he reflected, he should have known that no live man\r\ncould keep a woman or a pig in the house when she wanted to be off.'\r\n\r\nA subscription raised for him outside the Court realised twenty-three\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\nTradition goes that when Lord Kimberley, Lord Carlingford, and Lord\r\nGranville were all in Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet, Mr. Chamberlain--then at\r\nthe Board of Trade--in a moment of vexation called them 'Gladstone's\r\ngrannies,' and if the phrase is not his, it most certainly was apt and\r\ntruthful.\r\n\r\nLord Kimberley was known as 'Pussy' among a gang of disrespectful\r\nsubordinates. He really did as little to earn respect as he did to\r\nforfeit it; in fact he was a pre-eminently respectable mediocrity of the\r\nkind that, towards the close of the mid-Victorian period, clung like\r\nbarnacles to office, and he was a Whig during the period that Whiggism\r\nwas growing obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Abercorn certainly had no tendencies towards the lavish\r\nextravagance by which a modern Lord-Lieutenant has to pay his footing. A\r\nshort time before he was chosen he had claimed the Dukedom of\r\nChatelherault in France, and was known in consequence among the\r\nmalcontents as the 'French Frog.' His wife was the daughter of one Duke\r\nof Bedford, and when another came to stay at the viceregal, it was for a\r\ntime called the 'Dukeries.' The A.D.C.'s, who were particularly\r\ngood-looking, were at once known as the 'Duckeries.'\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Marlborough settled down well to his work. He was frankly\r\nthe friend of the landlords, and did his best for them. But he brought\r\nno English politicians in his train; he never thought he could settle\r\nevery Irish question after he had smoked a pipe over it; and he was\r\nnever inaccessible.\r\n\r\nHe came on a visit to Muckross when Sir Ivor Guest had the shooting, and\r\nI dined there to meet him. He visited Killarney on several occasions,\r\nand on each of them I had long talks with him. I always thought him a\r\npainstaking, well-meaning man.\r\n\r\nLord Cowper was an honest nonentity who left the country in disgust\r\nbecause he was not backed up by the Government. Several modern\r\nfigureheads would be very much surprised at any Government expecting\r\nthem to do more than 'understudy Royalty.' But Cowper thought himself a\r\ndiplomatist; was fond of authoritatively laying down the law on\r\ncontinental affairs, as though he had the refusal of the Foreign Office\r\nin his pocket; and felt he ought to have as much support as Palmerston\r\nobtained from the various Cabinets he burdened with European embroglios.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lord Spencer, on being reappointed for a second term, took up\r\nthe thankless task at an especially black moment. He was as brave as a\r\nlion; and if his red beard gained him the nickname of 'Rufus,' the Red\r\nViceroy was as fearless as though his life were absolutely secure,\r\ninstead of depending wholly on the vigilance of those surrounding him.\r\n\r\nWe all admired Lord Spencer for his firmness; but this was soon\r\ndiscovered to be due to the fact that he absolutely followed the sage\r\nadvice of Sir Edward Sullivan, the Lord Chancellor, and after the death\r\nof the latter, Lord Spencer's weakness was quite as remarkable as his\r\nprevious firmness.\r\n\r\nHe was seen on one occasion with his hands pressing his back.\r\n\r\nSaid one man:--\r\n\r\n'I fear his Excellency has lumbago.'\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' replied his friend; 'he is feeling for his backbone.'\r\n\r\nThe state of Westmeath was really the worst feature of the period of his\r\nrule, yet Lord Spenser was in the country all the while, and allowed\r\nmatters to degenerate with his eyes open.\r\n\r\nHe rode hard to hounds, in spite of countless threats, and might have\r\nhad a less uncomfortable time had the head of the Constabulary been as\r\nthoroughly capable as his subordinates.\r\n\r\nLord Carnarvon very nearly ruined the Government by his communications\r\nwith Mr. Parnell. He meant well, and struck out a patriotic line of his\r\nown, which failed because it was made in absolute ignorance of the Irish\r\ncharacter. But he never intended to involve his colleagues, although\r\nnumbers of people chose to regard him as a Tory Home Ruler. His previous\r\naction in resigning the Secretaryship of the Colonies in Lord Derby's\r\nthird administration, owing to a difference of opinion on parliamentary\r\nreform, and his subsequent resignation because he disapproved of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield's Eastern action in 1878, showed him to be a man of marked\r\nand fearless opinions. Lord Salisbury ought to have known that he was\r\nthrusting a brand into the fire when he sent him to be the official\r\nbellows-blower of the Hibernian pot.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen will always be remembered as the husband of his wife. Lady\r\nAberdeen was a more ardent Home Ruler than even her brother, Lord\r\nTweedmouth. On one occasion Lord Morris was next her at dinner, and she\r\nsaid she supposed the majority of people in Ireland were in favour of\r\nHome Rule.\r\n\r\n'Indeed, then, with the exception of yourself and the waiters, there's\r\nnot one in the room,' was his answer.\r\n\r\n'Of course, not in the Castle,' she replied with dignity; 'but in your\r\nprofession, and when you are on circuit, surely you must meet a good\r\nmany?'\r\n\r\n'Occasionally--in the dock,' he drily retorted, after which she\r\ndiscreetly dropped the subject.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen was most exemplary during his brief tenure of office, and\r\ncertainly it was not in his time that the folk christened the royal box\r\nat the theatre the 'loose box,' in allusion to the rather dubious\r\nEnglish guests of the vivacious viceroy.\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry and Lord Zetland may be both briefly bracketed together\r\nas having done their duty admirably in times less out of joint than\r\nthose of their predecessors. Lord Londonderry always drank Irish whisky\r\nhimself, and recommended it to his guests as a capital beverage--a thing\r\nwhich the licensed victuallers did not mind mentioning to Paddy and Mick\r\nwhen they were having a drop, despite their vaunted contempt of all at\r\n'the Castle.'\r\n\r\nNo other Lord-Lieutenant ever had such a mournful experience as Lord\r\nHoughton. Son of Monckton Milnes, the 'cool of the evening,' he needed\r\nhis father's temperament to enable him to endure the boycott which Irish\r\nsociety inflicted on him as the representative of the Home Rule\r\ndisruption policy. With no class did he go down, and on a crowded\r\nmarket-day in Tralee not a hat was raised to him.\r\n\r\nOne of his A.D.C.'s was subsequently on the veldt, and when asked if it\r\nwas not lonely, he replied:--\r\n\r\n'Not more than Dublin Castle, when Houghton was the king.'\r\n\r\nOn one occasion some people were officially commanded to dine. Not a\r\ncarriage was to be seen as they drove up to the Viceregal Lodge, so the\r\ngentleman told his coachman to drive round the Phoenix Park, as they\r\nmust be too early. There was still no sign of any gathering as they\r\nagain approached the official residence, and when they entered they\r\nfound they were the only guests, and the infuriated Lord Houghton, as\r\nwell as all his household had been kept waiting twenty minutes by this\r\nhapless pair.\r\n\r\nAnother story, which was much enjoyed in Ireland as showing the\r\npomposity of his Excellency, may be recalled. Whether true it is now\r\ndifficult to say, but there is no doubt that the tale was started among\r\nthe very house-party who were at Carton at the time.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful _châtelaine_, the lovely Duchess of Leinster, was walking\r\nthrough the fields one Sunday afternoon with Lord Houghton.\r\n\r\nThey came to a gate, which he opened, but to her astonishment proceeded\r\nto walk through it first himself.\r\n\r\nThe indignant Duchess haughtily remarked:--\r\n\r\n'The Prince of Wales would not think of passing through a gate before\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'That may be; but I represent the Queen,' replied Lord Houghton, with\r\nunruffled imperturbability.\r\n\r\nLord Cadogan and Lord Dudley come so absolutely into contemporary\r\nhistory that on them nothing can here be said, except that their\r\nmunificence has rendered it impossible for any peer of moderate private\r\nmeans to hold the office.\r\n\r\nIn sober truth, however, the administration of Government really rests\r\nwith the Chief Secretary in recent times, although it was not so before\r\nthe advent of Mr. Foster. Men like Lord Naas, Sir Robert Peel the\r\nyounger, and Mr. Chichester Fortescue--afterwards Lord Carlingford--were\r\nmere official cyphers, but after Mr. Gladstone's 1880 ministry this has\r\nnever been the case.\r\n\r\nOf Sir Robert Peel it was wittily said that when Chief Secretary he went\r\nthrough the country on an outside car, which made him take a one-sided\r\nview of the Irish question.\r\n\r\nLord Morris said to an inquiring Scottish M.P.:--\r\n\r\n'Did you ever know a Scottish Secretary who was not Scottish, or an\r\nIrish Secretary who was Irish?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said the Scotsman.\r\n\r\n'Well, go home and moralise over that as a possible solution of some\r\nIrish difficulties, for may be, if an Irishman was sent over, by\r\naccident, to be Chief Secretary, the official would not fall into the\r\nmistake of trying to reconcile the irerconcilable.'\r\n\r\nAnd to my mind Lord Morris had the last word in every sense.\r\n\r\nMr. W.E. Forster was far too honest to be the tool of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nHibernian dishonesty. He was perfectly fearless, but, beneath his rugged\r\nexterior, deeply sensitive. He winced under 'buckshot,' and many other\r\nepithets; but abuse and danger alike never prevented him from doing what\r\nhe had to do to the best of his ability. His earliest acquaintance with\r\nIreland had been in the famine, when he was one of the deputation of\r\nsuccour organised by the Society of Friends, and everybody who has read\r\nMr. Morley's _Life of Cobden_ will remember the appreciation of their\r\nefforts by the great free-trader.\r\n\r\nMr. Forster did not think the Irish administration should be all 'a\r\nscuffle and a scramble,' and he inaugurated a reversal of the old\r\nbalance between Lord-Lieutenants and Chief Secretaries which has never\r\nbeen subsequently changed. Indeed, it is often only the latter who has a\r\nseat in the Cabinet. He was the victim of many misapprehensions--the\r\nbulk of them wilful--but one which worried him was a widespread\r\nconviction that he was a slow man. His delivery was slow, his manner\r\ndeliberate, and he did not lightly give an opinion. Yet emphatically he\r\nwas not a slow man, and as an instance may be stated the fact that he\r\nelaborated his scheme of decentralising the powers of the Irish\r\nGovernment in a single evening in December 1881. I know he was harassed,\r\nnay, martyrised, beyond endurance, through the evasive volubility of Mr.\r\nGladstone, which, both by mouth and letter, formed a heavier burden than\r\nall the Irish attacks; but he was a just and conscientious man, and I\r\nnever heard of a case where appeal was made to him on which he did not\r\nact as reasonably as was compatible with loyalty to such a Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nHis courage in walking unarmed and without police escort in Tulla and\r\nAthenry was as great as ever was displayed by a knight-errant of old.\r\nThe Nationalist papers, no longer able to taunt him with cowardice, took\r\nto declaring him to be a person notorious for ferocious brutality.\r\n\r\nSir Wemyss Reid said that in the House of Commons his fellow-members had\r\nliterally seen his hair whiten during those two years of patriotic\r\nmartyrdom in Ireland, and I always feel that the inner life of this\r\nreticent, commanding statesman would have made a wonderful human\r\ndocument. His capacity, if not his forbearance, has been inherited by\r\nhis adopted son, Mr. Arnold Forster, the present Secretary for War, who\r\nacted as his private secretary in the latter years of his life.\r\n\r\nWhen I read Lord Rosebery's speech advocating a Cabinet of business men,\r\nI instinctively thought of the late Mr. W.E. Forster, and it is his heir\r\nwho is the first illustration of the Liberal Peer's theory. Since\r\nCromwell cleared out the House of Commons, no one has done so much as\r\nMr. Arnold Forster, for he upset the seats of the mighty in the War\r\nOffice three months after he kissed hands. I wonder how he would have\r\ndealt with Parnellism and crime.\r\n\r\nMr. Forster's predecessor, Mr. James Lowther, was an uncommonly capable\r\nman, and gifted with a fund of humour which prevented him from taking\r\nthe Irish too seriously. In 1879 I heard the Irish members in the House\r\nof Commons vituperating him after a manner that subsequently became\r\nunpleasantly familiar, but was then regarded as a gross breach of the\r\nconventions of debate. 'Jim' lay back on the Treasury bench with his hat\r\nover his eyes, and to all appearance sound asleep. Never once did he\r\nshow sign of hearing their verbal tornado; but eventually he sprang to\r\nhis feet, and with infectious gaiety literally chaffed them to madness.\r\nI have often thought that the long-limbed Tory member for Hertford, who\r\nwas then private secretary to his uncle, Lord Salisbury, must have taken\r\nnote of the methods of Mr. Lowther in dealing with the Irish party, for\r\nit was absolutely on the same lines that he subsequently developed that\r\nsuperb flow of sarcasm which made him, Mr. A.J. Balfour, the popular\r\nidol ten years later.\r\n\r\nIt has been a practice for many years to appoint a man Chief Secretary\r\nfor Ireland in order to see if he is fit for anything else. This plan\r\nturned out well in the case of Mr. A.J. Balfour, for he knew Ireland\r\nbetter than any other Chief Secretary, and when he came to know it\r\nproperly he was removed.\r\n\r\nHis brother did as much harm in Ireland as Mr. Arthur Balfour did good.\r\nIndeed, in the whole nineteenth century no other incompetent Chief\r\nSecretary misunderstood Ireland with such complete complacency, and if\r\nit had not been for the supervision which 'A.J.' undoubtedly gave, Mr.\r\nGerald Balfour would have a still worse record.\r\n\r\nThere was a poem, not particularly brilliant, which may be quoted\r\nbecause it is not widely known:--\r\n\r\n  'If I had a Balfour who wrong would go,\r\n   Do you think I'd tolerate him?--No, no, no!\r\n   I'd give him coercion in Kilmainham jail,\r\n   And return him to Arthur, who'd laugh at his wail.'\r\n\r\nIn fact the impression prevailed that Ireland was then sacrificed to the\r\nnepotism of Lord Salisbury, who had inflicted the least capable of the\r\nHouse of Cecil on the distressful country.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of York was in Ireland, he stayed with Lord Dunraven, and\r\nMr. Gerald Balfour as Chief Secretary was one of the house-party, and\r\nthe mother of the Knight of Glin was also there.\r\n\r\nA short time before, a chemist from Cork, who had been appointed\r\nsub-confiscator, and desired to secure his own position, had heavily cut\r\ndown the Fitzgerald rents.\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour, by way of making polite conversation, observed to Mrs.\r\nFitzgerald:--\r\n\r\n'I believe your son's property has been a long time in the family.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she said, 'we got it in the reign of Edward I., and held it until\r\nlast year, when the Government sent an apothecary from Cork to rob us of\r\nit.'\r\n\r\nThe conversation dropped.\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Balfour was very plucky, not only personally, but in his\r\nlegislative efforts, and he did wonders for Ireland--the light railways\r\nrelieving numbers from starvation, and opening up the country.\r\n\r\nAn English journalist went down to the West, and tried to make inquiries\r\nabout the popularity of the Chief Secretary.\r\n\r\nHe came to the cabin of a man who had been rescued from starvation by\r\ngetting Government employment, and had thrived so well that he had\r\nbecome possessed of a pig.\r\n\r\nThis pig, on the appearance of the Englishman, escaped into a\r\npotato-field, and he heard the woman of the house shout to her son:--\r\n\r\n'Mickey, look sharp and turn out Arthur Balfour before he does any\r\nmischief.'\r\n\r\nThe name of the pig showed the gratitude of the family.\r\n\r\nWhen alluding to Mr. Lowther I omitted to mention that he was always of\r\nopinion that a well-planned scheme of education was the best panacea for\r\nthe Irish troubles, and it certainly would have brought up a generation\r\nless keenly sensitive to the exaggerated wrongs of the country to which\r\nboth sexes are so frantically attached. During his not very lengthy\r\ntenure of the office of Chief Secretary it was asserted that Sir George\r\nTrevelyan also had some such idea; but whether he went so far as to\r\ndraft his plan, and it was consigned to some forgotten pigeon-hole by\r\nMr. Gladstone, I cannot say.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Argyll described Sir George Trevelyan as a jelly-fish,\r\nhe made a comparison which, from my personal experience, I should call\r\nparticularly apt.\r\n\r\nIreland had very little use for such a flabby politician, and it may be\r\nadded, he had very little use for Ireland.\r\n\r\nHe was in such a devil of a fright at being forced to succeed poor Lord\r\nFrederick Cavendish that it was some time before the pressure put upon\r\nhim sufficed to make him accept office, nor would he be induced to go\r\nover to Dublin Castle at all until he had been given Cabinet rank. As\r\nfor the Cabinet, they were so anxious to settle upon a living target for\r\nthe Home Rulers to practise upon, and so afraid that through his default\r\none of themselves might have to undertake the unpleasant office, that\r\nthey would have given the prospective victim almost anything he liked,\r\non the principle of letting the condemned criminal choose what he\r\nprefers for his final meal before that brief interview with the hangman.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectly after the formation of the following Radical Government, I met\r\nan Englishman of considerable political importance in Pall Mall, and he\r\nobserved:--\r\n\r\n'The new Cabinet is quarrelling among themselves.'\r\n\r\n'Who are fighting?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Chamberlain and Trevelyan,' he replied.\r\n\r\n'What about?'\r\n\r\n'Chamberlain says that he brought the party back into office, and he\r\nwants the Colonial Office; but Gladstone insists on his being content\r\nwith the Local Government Board. Trevelyan says that, as he has for\r\nyears had experience in naval affairs, he ought to be made First Lord.\r\nBut Gladstone, though he cannot prevail on him to be Chief Secretary,\r\nhas sent him to the India Office.'\r\n\r\n'And may give him free lodgings in Kilmainham if he is refractory,' I\r\nchimed in. 'And so these two are like pigs with their bristles hurt,\r\npoor things. There's a pity.'\r\n\r\nSome time later, when I heard Messrs. Chamberlain and Trevelyan were so\r\ndisgusted with the Home Rule Bill that they were leaving the Government,\r\nsays I to myself, 'I wonder if Mr. Gladstone in his own heart thinks if\r\nhe had gratified their wishes about office he could have retained them.'\r\n\r\nBut as a matter of fact both are patriots far above such demeaning\r\ninsinuations.\r\n\r\nMr. John Morley was a very well-meaning Chief Secretary, but a very\r\nmisguided man.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with me, Mr. Morley observed that, owing to the\r\nagitation, he saw no alternative but to make Parnell Chief Secretary.\r\n\r\nI said that would be no use, for if he attempted to do his duty he would\r\nbe shot, even more readily than I should.\r\n\r\nMr. Morley retorted:--\r\n\r\n'He is the leader of the Irish nation.'\r\n\r\n'I admit it,' I replied, 'and he is the only man you can make terms\r\nwith.'\r\n\r\n'How?' says he.\r\n\r\n'You had better ask him,' says I, 'to nominate some foreign potentate to\r\nappoint commissioners who will say to Mr. Parnell, \"Let Ireland pay her\r\nshare of the national debt and buy out every loyal person who wishes to\r\nleave the country,\" and then, if Mr. Parnell says, \"We are not able to\r\ndo that,\" let them retort, \"We will then disfranchise you, for this\r\nhumbug has been going on long enough.\"'\r\n\r\n'That's about it, according to your lights,' replied Mr. Morley.\r\n\r\nWas I not right?\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that Ulster and Alsace-Lorraine have about the\r\nsame acreage--5,322,334 to 3,586,560--and about the same\r\npopulation--1,581,357 to 1,719,470. The French and Germans are each\r\nwilling to spend a hundred millions of money and half a million lives,\r\nthe one to recover, the other to retain, the province, and yet Mr.\r\nGladstone proposed, not only to abandon Ulster, but to put it under the\r\nrule of the people the Ulsterites hate most on earth.\r\n\r\nIt is also remarkable that at the time of the Union the population of\r\nBelfast was 35,000, and Dublin 250,000. Now Belfast is 335,000, while\r\nDublin remains at a quarter of a million. Belfast, in point of customs,\r\nis the third largest city in the British dominions, coming next after\r\nLondon and Liverpool, whilst it is the finest shipbuilding town in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nYet its inhabitants were to be sold as though they were African slaves,\r\nfor the sole purpose of getting votes for the Liberal Government.\r\n\r\nI was one day invited by Froude to come to his home to argue out the\r\nIrish question with Mr. Jacob Bright and Mr. John Morley.\r\n\r\nI counted on having Mr. Froude on my side, knowing his strong views, but\r\nas host he would not interfere. However, Miss Cobbe was there, and to my\r\nmind was equal to any of the company. With her on my side, I flatter\r\nmyself we were too many for the others; but the worst of all arguments\r\nis that the arguing rarely serves any purpose except to make either\r\nparty more obstinate.\r\n\r\nI knew John Bright very well.\r\n\r\nHe was far and away the most honest man of all the Liberal party, and he\r\nfully realised the fact that a visible concentration of property and\r\nuniversal suffrage could not exist together. He was therefore anxious to\r\nenlarge the number of proprietors, but he did not countenance it being\r\ndone entirely at the expense of the English Government without the\r\ntenants having to find such a sum of money out of their own pockets as\r\nwould give them an interest in paying off the Government charges.\r\n\r\nHe was a very broad-minded man, with a simplicity of character which was\r\nadmirable. I liked him much, and my one complaint against him was that\r\nhe would never accept my invitations to come and pay me a visit in\r\nKerry.\r\n\r\nI never heard him make a speech, but with his beautiful voice it was a\r\ngreat treat to hear him read Milton. On one occasion he took me to the\r\nHouse specially to see Mr. Gladstone, but after nearly an hour he had\r\nreluctantly to tell me that the Prime Minister could not find leisure\r\nfor our conversation that day owing to pressure of business, and another\r\nopportunity never came.\r\n\r\nAlthough I regret not having met Mr. Gladstone, I yet feel glad that I\r\nnever shook him by the hand. I may here mention that I never met Mr.\r\nParnell, though I have seen him in the House.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view Mr. John Morley has a dual existence. As man and\r\nas historian he is Jekyl, but as politician he is Hyde.\r\n\r\nThere is a well-known story about him, so familiar to some of us that it\r\nis possibly forgotten in England, wherefore I venture to relate it once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nHe was on a car, and asked the driver:--\r\n\r\n'Well, Pat, you'll be having great times when you get Home Rule?'\r\n\r\n'We will, your honour--for a week,' replied the man.\r\n\r\n'Why only a week?' inquired the politician.\r\n\r\n'Driving the quality to the steamers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nGLADSTONIAN LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the exact measure of my appreciation of the Irish policy of the\r\nmost dangerous Englishman of the nineteenth century has already been\r\nclearly indicated by casual remarks in previous chapters, that will not\r\nabsolve me from duly setting forth some sketch of the inestimable amount\r\nof evil which resulted from the interest he unfortunately took in my\r\nunhappy land.\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon was the scourge of Europe, Mr. Gladstone was the most\r\nmalevolent imp of mischief that ever ruined any one country, and I am\r\nheartily grieved that that country should have been mine.\r\n\r\nIt is so difficult to get English people to take any interest in Irish\r\ntopics that I fully expect this chapter will be skipped by most of my\r\nreaders east of Dublin. Yet if any will read these few pages, they will\r\nget as clear a view of the harm one man can do a whole land as by wading\r\nthrough hundreds of volumes, for I am giving them the concentrated\r\nknowledge I have accumulated by years devoted to profound study of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe course of history may be taken up almost on the morrow of the\r\nfamine, for potatoes began to be a scarce crop again in 1850, yet the\r\ncountry was improving rapidly, and the relations between landlord and\r\ntenant were as cordial as in any part of the world.\r\n\r\nSo they continued in absolute amity until what is virtually universal\r\nsuffrage was introduced and the ignoramus became the tool of every\r\npolitical knave.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone stated that he brought in the Irish Church Act to pacify\r\nthe country in 1868, when the land was as peaceful as English pastures\r\non a Sunday evening. He must really have done so to propitiate English\r\ndissenters, for no one in Ireland appeared to want it.\r\n\r\nBy this Act a resident gentleman was taken away from every parish in\r\nIreland, whereby the evils of absentee landlordism were gravely\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone called it an act of sublime justice from England to\r\nIreland. Previously, in virtue of ancient treaties commencing as far\r\nback as the reigns of William and Mary, the English Government was\r\ngiving Presbyterians a grant--called Regium Donum--of £70,000 a year,\r\nand by a more recent arrangement was giving Maynooth a grant of £24,000,\r\nbut that Whig Government actually paid them off out of the spoils of the\r\nIrish Church, thereby saving the British Exchequer £94,000 a year.\r\n\r\nAnd if this be an act of justice, then Aristides can be classed among\r\nhypocritical swindlers.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that when William Pitt caused the Act of Union\r\nto be passed in Parliament, the union of the Churches was a fundamental\r\nfeature, and this, indeed, was the main inducement held out to\r\nProtestants to promote the Union.\r\n\r\nSurely it cannot be held to be a valid Union when the principal\r\nconsideration in it is set aside, to say nothing of increasing the\r\ntaxation by two million sterling a year more than was ever contemplated\r\nby the Act. This was clearly borne out by a Royal Commission composed\r\nmostly of Englishmen and presided over by Mr. Childers, an earnest\r\npolitician and an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic priests who expected that their Church would be established\r\nwere disappointed, while the landlords, who were generally Protestants,\r\nhad henceforth to support their clergy and at the same time to pay\r\ntithes to the State.\r\n\r\nAs Irish taxation increased 50 per cent, while that of England only\r\nincreased 18 per cent., the Irish people did not find Mr. Gladstone's\r\nAct soothing or profitable.\r\n\r\nHis next perpetration was the Land Act of 1870, whereby he provided that\r\nno landlord could turn out his tenant without paying him for all his\r\nimprovements (even if these had been done without the knowledge or\r\nsanction of the landlord) and giving the tenant a compensation in money\r\nequal to about one-fourth of the fee-simple.\r\n\r\nThis Act might have been all right in principle, but it was useless in\r\npractice, and the compensation made to the County Court Judge for\r\nadjudicature came to far more than the amount awarded.\r\n\r\nThis is easily accounted for, thus:--\r\n\r\nYou might as well bring in an Act of Parliament to prevent people\r\ncutting off their own noses.\r\n\r\nNo sane person does such a thing, and no landlord ever turned out an\r\nimproving tenant.\r\n\r\nBut the Irish tenants, having almost the sole representation of the\r\ncountry in their hands, returned a body of representatives pledged to\r\nthe confiscation of landed property; and in order to keep his party in\r\npower by securing their votes, Mr. Gladstone brought in the Land Act of\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nI heard him introduce the motion in the House of Commons, and his speech\r\nwas a truly marvellous feat of oratory. He was interrupted on all sides\r\nof the House, and in a speech of nearly five hours in length never once\r\nlost the thread of his discourse.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could judge, he never even by accident let slip one word of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nWhen the Act passed, Mr. Gladstone anticipated that eight\r\nsub-commissioners would do the work. This number very soon ran up to one\r\nhundred sub-commissioners and more than twenty County Court valuers.\r\n\r\nThe result is that every tenant has been running down his land and\r\nletting it go out of cultivation, for the tenants know the commissioners\r\nvalue the ground as they find it, and a premium is thus, of course, put\r\non neglecting the soil.\r\n\r\nTo show the system on which the valuation was done, many cases have been\r\nknown of the commissioners arriving to value a property after three\r\no'clock on a December afternoon.\r\n\r\nIt is a positive fact that there are professional experts who obtain\r\nsubstantial fees for showing tenants the speediest methods of damaging\r\ntheir own land.\r\n\r\nAll the same I cannot help thinking their services are a matter of\r\nsupererogation, for a recalcitrant Irish tenant in the South and West\r\nneeds instruction in no branch of villainy.\r\n\r\nOn one of Lord Kenmare's estates, I executed drainage works costing over\r\n£200. These were dependent upon sluices to keep out the tide at high\r\nwater. A few days before the land was to be inspected, the tenants put\r\nbushes in the sluices, let the tide in and flooded the whole land.\r\n\r\nAnd then a prating, mendacious local schoolmaster began comparing these\r\nvillains to the patriotic Dutch who flooded their land rather than\r\npermit it to be conquered by the national foe.\r\n\r\nI could give scores of such instances of wilful destruction of property\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining a reduction.\r\n\r\nHere is one.\r\n\r\nA tenant near Blarney, in County Cork, was seen to be ploughing up a\r\nvaluable water meadow.\r\n\r\nWhen asked by a gentleman why he was injuring his land, he replied\r\nwithout hesitation that he was going to get his rent fixed, and\r\nimmediately afterwards he should lay it down again as a water meadow.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely credible how great was the amount of perjury that this\r\nAct brought into the country.\r\n\r\nA tenant on a property to which I was agent, whose rent was £6 a year,\r\nswore he expended £395 on improvements and all that it was worth\r\nafterwards was £4, 10s. He received the implicit credit of the court.\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of the Roman Catholic Church perjury in a court of\r\njustice is a reserved sin for which absolution can only be given by a\r\nbishop or by priests specially appointed for that purpose.\r\n\r\nOne priest applied to the bishop for plenary powers, and said the bishop\r\nto him:--\r\n\r\n'Are the people so generally bad in your parish?'\r\n\r\n'It's the fault of the laws, my lord,' replied the priest.\r\n\r\n'What laws?' asked the bishop.\r\n\r\n'Firstly, under the Crimes Act, my poor people have to swear they do not\r\nknow the moonlighters that come to the house, or they would be murdered.\r\n\r\n'Secondly, under the Arrears Act, they have to swear they are worth\r\nnothing in the world or they would not get the Government money.\r\n\r\n'Thirdly, under the Land Act, while they have to swear up their own\r\nimprovements, they must also swear down the value of the land, or they\r\nwill get no reductions.\r\n\r\n'So you see, my lord, the sin lies at the door of those who made the\r\ninfamous laws which lead weak sinners into temptation they cannot be\r\nexpected to overcome.'\r\n\r\nThe bishop said nothing, but he gave the priest all the powers he\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nI myself heard this story from a parish priest who was present, and as I\r\nhave several times told it to different people, it may have found its\r\nway into print, though I have no recollection of ever seeing it in black\r\nand white.\r\n\r\nAllusion having just been made to the Arrears Act, it may be here\r\nopportune to point out that this was the next step in Mr. Gladstone's\r\nlong sequence of Irish mismanagement. This iniquitous measure provided\r\nthat no matter how great the arrears owed by the tenant, by lodging one\r\nyear's rent another could be obtained from the Government, and the\r\nlandlord was compelled to wipe out the balance. So that if Jack, Tom,\r\nand James were all tenants on town land, should Jack be an honest man he\r\nobtained no redress, whereas if Tom and James were hardened defaulters\r\nthey obtained the complete settlement of all their arrears.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the grant of a year's rent from Government, the tenant had to\r\nswear as to his assets and also as to the selling value of his farm.\r\n\r\nHere is an illustration which came under my own observation.\r\n\r\nA tenant named Richard Sweeney, whose rent was £48 a year, owed three\r\nyears' rent. He paid one year, the Government provided another, and the\r\nlandlord had to forgive the third.\r\n\r\nTo obtain this result, Sweeney swore that the selling value of his farm\r\nwas _nil_, and he received a receipt in full.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later he served me--as agent for the landlord--with notice\r\nthat he had sold his interest in the property for £630.\r\n\r\nThat is not the end of my story.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser was a man named Murphy, and a very few years afterwards,\r\nupon the ground that the rent was too dear, he took the farm for which\r\nhe had paid £630 to Sweeney into the Land Courts and got the rent\r\nreduced to £36.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of this system was well brought out before the Fry\r\nCommission, when one high-commissioner and a sub-commissioner both said\r\nthat in valuing the land they took into consideration the tenant's\r\noccupation interest.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see the way this works out, if he will accept the very\r\nsimple hypothetical case of two tenants holding land to the worth of £40\r\neach, and one of them only paying £20 a year rent. When they both took\r\ntheir cases into the Land Court, the man paying the lower rent of £20\r\nwould obtain the larger reduction, because he had the greater\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nThese facts will show that a Purchase Bill was an absolute necessity.\r\nLord Dufferin truly remarked that landlord and tenant were both in the\r\nsame bed, and Mr. Gladstone thought to settle their disputes by giving\r\nthe tenant a larger share than he had ever had before. But the tenant\r\nconsidered that as he had obtained that concession by fraud and\r\nviolence, if he could only give one effective kick more, he would put\r\nthe landlord on the floor for the rest of the term of their national\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen introducing the Land Act of 1870, Mr. Gladstone proved himself if\r\nnot an Irish statesman, an admirable prophet, for he denounced in\r\nanticipation exactly what the effect of the Land Act of 1881 would be.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, he prospectively criticised such an institution as the Land\r\nCourt, which in 1881 he proposed, with its power to give a 'judicial\r\nrent.'\r\n\r\n'But it is suggested we should establish, permanently and positively, a\r\npower in the hands of the State to reduce excessive rents. Now I should\r\nlike to hear a careful argument in support of that plan. I wish at all\r\nevents to retain at all times a judicial habit of not condemning a thing\r\nutterly until I have heard what is to be said for it; but I own I have\r\nnot heard, I do not know, and I cannot conceive, what is to be said for\r\nthe prospective power to reduce excessive rents. If I could conceive a\r\nplan more calculated than everything else, first of all, for throwing\r\ninto confusion the whole economical arrangements of the country;\r\nsecondly, for driving out of the field all solvent and honest men who\r\nmight be bidders for farms; thirdly, for carrying widespread\r\ndemoralisation throughout the whole mass of the Irish people, I must say\r\nit is this plan.'\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\r\n\r\n'We are not ready to accede to a principle of legislation by which the\r\nState shall take into its own hands the valuation of rent throughout\r\nIreland. I say, \"take into its own hands\" because it is perfectly\r\nimmaterial whether the thing shall be done by a State officer forming\r\npart of the Civil Service, or by an arbitration acting under State\r\nauthority, or by any other person invested by the law with power to\r\ndetermine on what terms as to rent every holding in Ireland shall be\r\nheld.'\r\n\r\nThis categorical denunciation of the principle which he was then asked,\r\nand which he peremptorily refused to sanction, was not enough for Mr.\r\nGladstone, for the records of debate show he went farther, but enough\r\nhas been cited to show that never was prophecy more fully fulfilled.\r\nOutrage followed outrage with a rapidity unequalled in Europe, and that\r\nin a country which previous to his remedial measures had practically\r\nbeen unstained by an agrarian outrage for fifty years.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be both remiss of me, and altogether below the\r\ncharacter which I trust I have acquired for honest plain speaking, if I\r\nomitted to give my views upon Mr. Wyndham's Act, for those readers who\r\nregard my book as something more than a storehouse of anecdotes--and\r\nsince it is written at all, I maintain it claims to be more than\r\nthat--having noticed the freedom with which I have spoken of previous\r\nEnglish legislation for Ireland, may very naturally think I should be\r\nbegging the question of the hour, if I did not offer a few observations\r\non the latest development of the Irish question.\r\n\r\nI must emphatically repeat what I have already asserted:--that the Acts\r\nof Mr. Gladstone rendered a Purchase Bill inevitable, and it fell to Mr.\r\nWyndham's lot to formulate the scheme which has now become law.\r\n\r\nMr. Wyndham's Act is a great one for Ireland, because where a tenant\r\npreviously paid £100 a year rent, all he will have to pay--even at\r\ntwenty-four years' purchase--is £80 a year, and at that rate with the\r\nbonus the landlord obtains twenty-seven years' purchase. But this scale\r\nis a little halcyon in most instances.\r\n\r\nIt should prove a boon to the country, and it is the necessary outcome\r\nof the Land Act of 1881, by which rents were cut down by commissioners,\r\nwhose means of living depended on the reductions they made.\r\n\r\nAnd to make this state of things yet more remarkable, there were two\r\ncourts established for fixing rates. The one consisted of\r\nsub-commissioners, who were paid by the year, and the other was that of\r\nthe County Court judge, who was wholly dependent on a valuer paid by the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nSo, whoever cut down the most earned the most.\r\n\r\nA valuer in Limerick was remonstrated with for cutting down local rents\r\nso low, and he replied:--\r\n\r\n'It is all for the good of trade, for it will bring every tenant into\r\nthe Court.'\r\n\r\nAnd so it actually did, for that Court very shortly afterwards was chock\r\nfull of cases.\r\n\r\nMy own opinion is that the Wyndham Act would have been far more\r\nbeneficial, if the Government had given the tenant a free grant of some\r\nof the purchase money, and insisted on his finding some more of it\r\nhimself, whereby would have been created a deeper interest in his land\r\nthan is now inspired in his breast by the mere transference of his lease\r\nfrom his old landlord to the Government.\r\n\r\nI made this remark to an Englishman at the Carlton Club, and he said to\r\nme that, according to his view, England should lend whatever money was\r\nwanted but give no free grant.\r\n\r\nI replied:--\r\n\r\n'A poor man from Kerry came to my house in London, and asked for the\r\nloan of a pound. I declined to lend him the sovereign, but I did lend\r\nhim half a crown, and as he bolted to America the very next day, I think\r\nI had the best of the bargain.'\r\n\r\nMy friend accepted the analogy and dropped the subject.\r\n\r\nThat was far more tactful on his part than the conduct of the English\r\nGovernment, for the different Acts of Parliament relating to Ireland\r\nhave had the effect of rendering the feelings between landlord and\r\ntenant much worse than they were before.\r\n\r\nAnd the Act of 1881, which provided that landlord and tenant should have\r\na lawsuit every fifteen years, brought the feeling up to boiling pitch.\r\n\r\nNow the Government inherits all this hatred by proposing to be the sole\r\nlandlord in Ireland. Therefore, England is reaping the whirlwind where\r\nMr. Gladstone sowed the wind.\r\n\r\nThis does not appear to me to be sound statesmanship. An open hatred of\r\nthe Government has been instilled into the brain of thousands of Irish\r\nchildren side by side with a more hypocritical hatred of the landlord.\r\nNow that these two are to be combined in one passion, and that directed\r\nagainst the receiver of rent, matters do not present a promising\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\nIf the Government sell up those tenants who do not pay rent in years to\r\ncome, no Irish occupiers of the property will be obtainable.\r\n\r\nIf English tenants be imported, the latter had better insist on coats of\r\nmail for themselves, and on life insurance policies in favour of the\r\nnearest relatives they leave behind in England.\r\n\r\nThat reminds me of a story.\r\n\r\nSir Denis Fitzpatrick and his daughter were making a tour of the Kerry\r\nfjords some years ago, and the lady asked a boatman on Caragh Lake, what\r\nwould happen to a tenant who took an evicted farm.\r\n\r\nThe reply was:--\r\n\r\n'I don't think he'd do it again, Miss, leastways it's in the next world\r\nalone he'd have the chance of making such a fool of himself.'\r\n\r\nThis may be commended to any unsophisticated English who contemplate\r\nHibernian immigration as a prospective way of cheaply obtaining that\r\nonce popular bait of Mr. Jesse Collins, three acres and a cow.\r\n\r\nHere is another aspect of not paying rent to Government, which would\r\noccur to no one unacquainted with Ireland, but is quite\r\ncharacteristic:--\r\n\r\nSuppose twenty men were tenants on a townland; one would pay, and the\r\nother nineteen after being evicted would also squat down on his patch.\r\nUnless caretakers at a cost of about three times the rent were put in\r\nunder excessive police protection, all the nineteen farms would promptly\r\nbecome derelict.\r\n\r\nIt would have been far better if the Government had given a free grant\r\nof one quarter of the purchase money, had compelled the tenant to\r\nhimself find another quarter, and had lent the remaining half for a\r\ncomparatively short term, say twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nThen the tenant would have had genuine interest in the redemption of his\r\nown property.\r\n\r\nBut, asks the English tourist impressed by the apparent beggarliness of\r\nall he sees, how could the tenant procure a quarter of the money?\r\n\r\nNaturally it would be alleged by the agitators that he could not. All\r\nthe same you may confidently contradict any such denial as that.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that almost any tenant could get the money, if you bear in\r\nmind that though rents are so reduced, the most unimproving tenant can\r\nget from ten to twenty years' purchase for the good-will of his farm.\r\n\r\nOf course, just now the old order is changing considerably in Ireland,\r\nbut the loss of their old landlords is not appreciated by the better\r\nclass of tenants, though the good have of course to suffer for the\r\nbad--a thing even better known in my country than elsewhere. I heard an\r\ninteresting confirmation of this from a lady of my acquaintance, who\r\nhaving asked a respectable woman what had become of her son, received\r\nthe reply:--\r\n\r\n'Ah, for sure, he has got a situation with a farmer.'\r\n\r\n'Well, that's a good start in life, is it not?' asked my friend, to\r\nwhich the woman retorted in melancholy accents:--\r\n\r\n'That may be, but my family have always been rared (_i.e._ reared) on\r\nthe gentry until now,' thereby expressing a feeling very prevalent in\r\nIreland to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Home Rulers allege that these high prices which are paid for the\r\ngood-will of land are attributable to two causes:--\r\n\r\n  _(a)_ Excess of competition for land.\r\n  _(b)_ Irish returning from America.\r\n\r\nBoth these reasons are absurd.\r\n\r\nWhen the population of Ireland was nearly eight millions, these prices\r\ncould not be obtainable, nor anything like them, while to-day the\r\npopulation is only four millions. Unless the returning emigrants thought\r\nthey were obtaining good value for their money, they would hardly\r\nabandon a country--the United States--where they can get land for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe enormous increase in the Irish Savings Banks, as well as the\r\ndeposits in other Irish Banks, must be almost entirely derived from the\r\nsavings of the farmers. The landlords have been ruined by the Land Act;\r\nlabourers have no money to spare; and traders will not leave their money\r\nidle at the small rate of interest credited.\r\n\r\nIf the farmers thought they had better means of using the money, they\r\nwould withdraw it, and they are without doubt as well aware as I am how\r\nthey can do the English Government in the future, for if there is any\r\nroguery unknown to them, it is infinitesimal.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I think many landlords will leave Ireland in\r\nconsequence of the Wyndham Act. The few who will go are those who are\r\nglad to be quit at any price, and to be free to pack out of the country.\r\nBut many a landlord will be far more comfortable on his own estate, when\r\nhe has rid himself of all his tenants.\r\n\r\nOne feature of this curious Act is that the Geraldines have got rid of\r\nthe last of their property, and escaped all the forfeitures.\r\n\r\nAs for the sporting rights, far too much fuss has been made over them.\r\nExcept where there are plantations or good fishing, they are of very\r\nlittle value one way or the other. The Act will not affect the hunting.\r\nSmall Irish farmers like to see the hunt almost as much as the hunting\r\nset themselves like to participate in it.\r\n\r\nOf course, too, the Act ought to be popular in Ireland, because it is\r\ntaking so much money out of England.\r\n\r\nA point I wish to emphasise is one about which there has been a great\r\ndeal of misconception.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of capital has been made out of the depreciation\r\nof agricultural produce in Ireland as compared with England. But Ireland\r\nis a stock-producing country and not an agricultural country in the\r\nstrict sense, for the cultivation of wheat in Ireland has long since\r\nceased to exist. The true relation may be seen in the fact that in\r\nEngland the difficulty of getting store-cattle was a loss to farmers,\r\nwhereas it has been a decided gain to farmers in Ireland--though they\r\nare not best pleased when you impress the fact on them.\r\n\r\nMr. Finlay Dun in _Landlords and Tenants in Ireland in 1881_ cites some\r\nexamples which may be apt to-day when we are considering Mr. Wyndham's\r\nAct.\r\n\r\nHe writes on page 64:--\r\n\r\n'Kilcockan parish between Lismore and Youghal was in great part disposed\r\nof in the Landed Estates Court thirty years ago. It was bought, some of\r\nit by occupiers, some of it by shopkeepers and attorneys. Rents have\r\nbeen raised, and there is not much appearance of prosperity. Newtown,\r\nfor several generations the fee-simple property of a family of the name\r\nof Nason, after the famine of 1846, was cut up and sold; the family\r\nresidence is in ruin. At Lower Curryglass, a few miles east of Lismore,\r\na good farm of five hundred acres, belonging to a family who have been\r\nobliged to leave it, bears sad evidence of neglect; the good old\r\ndeserted manor-house, the farm buildings, and a dozen cottages in the\r\nvillage are falling to pieces. Contrary to what might be anticipated,\r\nsome of the smaller proprietors in this district have been strenuous\r\nsupporters of the Land League, although it is to be hoped that they\r\nrepudiate the destruction of the cattle on the land of Mr. Grant, which\r\nwere stabbed, and some of them drowned in the river. Mr. Grant had come\r\nunder the ban of the League for evicting a dissipated bankrupt tenant,\r\nwhose debts to the extent of two hundred pounds he had paid, and who\r\nwould have been reinstated, if there had been the remotest prospect of\r\nreformed habits or of getting clear of his difficulties. Such acts\r\nappear to justify the statement, \"that Irishmen don't know what they\r\nwant, and won't be satisfied until they get it.\"'\r\n\r\nGod knows we have waded knee deep in blood of men, and domestic animals\r\nsince that was written, yet to-day are we any nearer the final solution\r\nof the Irish difficulties? In my opinion, certainly not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF KERRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that it is only within the last forty years that the\r\nbulk of the people of Ireland, long outside the pale of the ballot-box,\r\nhave actively entered political life. This is quite true.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Home Rule troubles followed the presentation of\r\npractically universal suffrage to the half-educated and\r\nover-enthusiastic Irish, who are easily led away, apt to believe\r\nmob-orators, and, by inherited instinct, to go against the Government.\r\n\r\nWhat the effect of universal suffrage in India would be it is not my\r\nbusiness to estimate. Still, the analogy of what the ballot-paper\r\nprovided in Ireland, if applied to the teeming population of our\r\nOriental Empire, suggests a pandemonium to which the horrors of the\r\nMutiny are but a mere scream of agony.\r\n\r\nThe ballot transformed Ireland; or rather, it permitted the worst\r\npassions of the most ignorant to be played upon by interested\r\nadventurers, when the political power of Ireland had passed for ever out\r\nof the hands of the restraining classes. Democracy spelt anarchy, and\r\nthe word patriotism was degraded in a way that had no parallel since the\r\nFrench Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe first outward and visible sign was the creation of the Irish Home\r\nRule party, which constituted itself separate and distinct from the rest\r\nof the House of Commons, the standard of which the new gang was to\r\ndebase. Nor did they rest content until it became the scene of faction\r\nfights and organised obstruction in combination with the flagrant\r\nviolation of all decencies of language and behaviour.\r\n\r\nMembers were returned for Irish constituencies who had been convicts;\r\nothers came who richly deserved imprisonment for life. They instigated\r\nmurders, and clamoured because the murderers were not regarded as\r\nheroes; or if they were hung, canonised them as martyrs. They attempted\r\nto prostitute the law to their own base standard of political morality.\r\nThey assiduously laboured to render life valueless in Ireland and\r\nproperty worthless, whilst no deed was too cowardly, no atrocity too\r\nbarbarous, for them to praise. They alone in modern times warred against\r\nwomen and children. Animals were the dumb victims of the inhuman\r\nferocity they in no way tried to check, and they effectively taught the\r\nreceptive Irish millions that a British Government could be coerced into\r\ngiving what was demanded provided a sufficient number of crimes created\r\na holocaust large enough to intimidate the weak-kneed at St. Stephen's.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Parnell and the Land League would all have been promptly reduced\r\nto the pitiful unimportance from which they had so noisily emerged if it\r\nhad not been for Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nThe root of English politics has been party government--'where all are\r\nfor a party, and none are for the State,' to reverse Macaulay's famous\r\nline. Now the Irish vote of sixty was a solid asset, capable in many\r\ncases of weighing down one side of the political scale. It was obvious\r\nthat the votes would be unscrupulously given, and Mr. Gladstone bid\r\nhigher than the Tories. Literally the necessary parliamentary machinery\r\nfor the government of the United Kingdom was clogged by the\r\nNationalists, who brought obstruction to a fine art, and it was Mr.\r\nGladstone who always gave in when the Irish outcry would have stimulated\r\nan honest man to avail himself of all loyal forces which law and the\r\ncommon weal provided.\r\n\r\nLong before this the Irish political agitator had set himself to\r\nembitter the relations existing between landlord and tenant. An\r\nEnglishman goes into Parliament for various motives; an Irishman for his\r\nliving. If he did not outshout his neighbour, if he were not implicitly\r\nobedient to Mr. Parnell, if he did not arouse the worst passions of the\r\nworst people in his constituency, he was promptly dismissed.\r\n\r\nTo do them justice, the Irish members gave such an exhibition of\r\nblackguardism as has no parallel on earth, though it earned but the\r\nmildest rebuke from their obsequious ally, Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, for example, before this balloting away of all that was\r\ncreditable to Ireland, the relations between landlord and tenant were of\r\nthe most kindly nature. The leading landlords of Kerry generally\r\nrepresented the county in Parliament with uniform decency and occasional\r\nbrilliance, while larger sums were borrowed and expended by the\r\nlandlords under the Land Improvement Act than were spent in the same way\r\nin any other county. I can prove that the principal landowner in\r\nKerry--Lord Kenmare--expended a greater sum in ten years on his estates\r\nthan he received out of them, though I cannot say he ever found out for\r\nhimself that it was better to give than to receive.\r\n\r\nFor fifty years prior to what Mr. Gladstone was pleased to call his\r\n'remedial legislation,' Kerry was unstained by agrarian crime; all\r\nthings went on smoothly, and a number of railways were constructed with\r\nguaranteed capital, half of which was contributed by the landlords,\r\nalthough they received no benefit from the increased prices of farm\r\nproduce caused by railway communication. The Board of Works returns show\r\nthat the money borrowed by Kerry landlords under the different Land\r\nImprovement Acts amounted to almost half a million, and yet the\r\ndeductions made under the Land Act were greater in Kerry than in other\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance from my own experience.\r\n\r\nI purchased from the Government in 1879 an estate, the rental of which\r\nwas £517, 2s. 4d.; it was considered so cheaply let that the majority of\r\nthe tenants offered twenty-seven years' purchase for their farms. I\r\nborrowed from the Government and expended on drainage £1120, 14s. 11d.\r\nThen the Commissioners under the Land Act reduced the rental to £495,\r\n10s. 6d., and the Government which sold me the estate continued to\r\ncompel me to pay interest on the amount borrowed, although by its own\r\nlegislation I was deprived of any advantage resulting from the outlay.\r\n\r\nThe rental of Kerry in 1870 was considerably less than it had been forty\r\nyears previously, and higher prices were paid for the fee-simple of land\r\nthan were offered in any other part of Ireland. But Mr. Gladstone's\r\n'remedial manoeuvres' changed the country and the people.\r\n\r\nDemoralising bribes to the Irish nation frittered away the proceeds of\r\nthe plunder of the Irish Church. A notable instance was a million under\r\nthe Arrears Act, the principle of which was that no honest tenant who\r\nhad paid his rent could derive any benefit from it, but that any\r\ndrunkard or squanderer who had not paid his rent might have it paid for\r\nhim by the Government on swearing that he was unable to pay.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance that occurred on an estate under my management.\r\n\r\nA tenant, whose yearly rent was £48, had one year's rent paid by\r\nGovernment and another year's rent given up by his landlord, on his\r\nswearing that the selling value of his farm was _nil_; ten weeks\r\nafterwards he served me with a notice, as required by the statute, that\r\nhe had sold the interest of the farm for £670.\r\n\r\nAgain, there was a tenant who swore that he had expended £513, 14s. 6d.\r\nin permanent improvements, and that after this expenditure the fair\r\nletting value of the farm was only £17, though the original rent was\r\n£26, 4s.\r\n\r\nHow could I blame an ignorant peasantry for making false statements,\r\nwhen laws were framed by the leaders of public opinion in England which\r\nreleased the Irish tenants from every moral obligation, and made their\r\nassumed responsibilities and agreements a dead letter; while orators,\r\nliving on the wages of patriotism, were allowed to preach sedition and\r\nplunder to an excitable people? The result was that the work of\r\ndemoralisation made rapid progress, perjury became a joke, assassination\r\nwas merely 'removal,' and men who had been brutally murdered were said\r\nto have met with an accident.\r\n\r\nI have already shown how apt a prophet Mr. Gladstone was in his forecast\r\nin the House of Commons in 1870, and one more quotation adds testimony\r\nto his inspiration--though from what direction it came I will not linger\r\nto inquire:--\r\n\r\n'Compulsory valuation and fixity of tenure would bring about total\r\ndemoralisation and a Saturnalia of crime.'\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nMr. Laing, formerly M.P. for Orkney, in a magazine article defended the\r\n'Plan of Campaign' as an innocent attempt to defend the weak against the\r\nstrong, and as having been adopted only on estates where rents were too\r\nhigh, in fact, as the result of high rents. As a matter of fact, in\r\nOrkney the rents advanced 194 per cent., and during the same period in\r\nKerry they dwindled. He also asserted that the Irish tenants'\r\nimprovements had been confiscated by the landlords as the tenant\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nCertainly the law did not prevent them increasing the rent; but,\r\nunfortunately for the reasoning of Mr. Laing, and his taking for granted\r\nimaginary 'confiscations,' figures most decidedly prove that the\r\nlandlords did not use any such power. The rentals have steadily\r\ndecreased while the landlords were borrowing and expending nearly half a\r\nmillion in my own county.\r\n\r\nThis fact is conclusively demonstrated by the Government returns.\r\n\r\nAs to the National League--with all its paraphernalia of boycotting,\r\nshooting from behind a hedge, merciless beating, shooting in the legs,\r\nand other similar variations of Irish Home Rule, on which I shall dwell\r\nin a later chapter--being only a protector of the weak tenant against\r\nthe hard landlord, I think one fact will prove more forcibly than any\r\nargument the fallacy of such an assertion.\r\n\r\nThere were two estates in Kerry let at a much lower rate than any others\r\nin the county--those of Lord Cork and Colonel Oliver.\r\n\r\nColonel Oliver's agent was the only one fired at in Kerry in 1886, and\r\nLord Cork's agent was the only one obliged to employ over two hundred\r\npolice to protect him in endeavouring to recover in 1887 rent which was\r\ndue in 1884. This rent was due on land let at considerably under the\r\nPoor Law valuation, and the rents were only half what was paid in 1860.\r\n\r\nThese cases afford a decided proof that the Land or National League\r\ncarries on its government irrespective of high or low rents, and the\r\n'Plan of Campaign' is worked according as the local branches of the\r\nLeague have disciplined or terrorised the inhabitants of a district, the\r\norders from 'headquarters' depending on the probability of success.\r\n\r\nI should like to retort on Mr. Laing that, while the evidence before the\r\nLand Commissioner proved the rental of Ireland was diminishing, that of\r\nthe country where his own property lay increased to an unusual degree. I\r\ndo not say the landlords confiscated the tenants' improvements, possibly\r\nthey made none. But figures are hard facts, and they prove three\r\nthings:--\r\n\r\nFirst, that Kerry landlords spent £453,539 on improvements. Secondly,\r\nthat the rental of Kerry was lower in 1880 than in 1840. Thirdly, that\r\nthe rental of Orkney increased 194 per cent. during that time.\r\n\r\nOn the south-west coast of Kerry lie the Blasquets, a group of islands\r\nthe property of Lord Cork, one of them inhabited by some twenty-five\r\nfamilies. The old rental was £80, which was regularly paid. This was\r\nreduced by Lord Cork to £40, the Government valuation being £60. Now\r\nthis island reared about forty milch cows, besides young cattle and\r\nsheep, and at the period when might meant right in Ireland the\r\ninhabitants, having some surplus stock, took possession of another\r\nisland to feed them on.\r\n\r\nThis island was let to another man, but he was not able to resist the\r\ntenants any more than the mouse nibbling a piece of cheese is able to\r\nfight a cat.\r\n\r\nFor ten years up to 1887 those tenants paid no poor rate. They\r\nsuccessfully resisted the payment of county cess, to the detriment of\r\ntheir fellow taxpayers, and they only paid one half year's rent out of\r\nsix, and that not until they had been served with writs. And these\r\npeople, in the year 1886, sent a memorial to the Government to save them\r\nfrom starvation.\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable case, and proves that poverty and the cry of\r\nstarvation are not always the result of rents and taxes, as the Irish\r\npatriots and their English separatist allies so frequently assert.\r\n\r\nI am going to quote a colloquy overheard at a Kerry fair to show how\r\ndeeply the teaching of Messrs. Parnell, Gladstone, Dillon, Morley,\r\nDavitt, Biggar, and Company has taken root in the Irish mind.\r\n\r\nJim from Castleisland meeting Mick from Glenbeigh, asks:--\r\n\r\n'Well, Mick, an' how are ye getting on?'\r\n\r\n'Illigant, glory be to the Saints.'\r\n\r\n'How's that, Mick? Sure, prices is low.'\r\n\r\n'True for you, Jim, prices is low; but what we _has_ we _has_, for we\r\npays nobody.'\r\n\r\nAnd to that I will add another observation.\r\n\r\nSomebody asked me:--\r\n\r\n'If Ireland were to get Home Rule, what would become of the agitator?'\r\n\r\nI replied:--\r\n\r\n'He would be called a reformer, unless it paid him better to clamour for\r\na fresh Union. He'd sell all his patriotism for five shillings, and his\r\nloyalty could be bought by a few glasses of whisky.'\r\n\r\nAnd that's the whole truth of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA GLANCE AT MY STEWARDSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nDavitt called the generation after O'Connell's 'a soulless age of\r\npitiable cowardice.'\r\n\r\nI should call the generation that was active in the early eighties 'a\r\ncowardly age of pitiless brutality.'\r\n\r\nTimes had begun to mend in Ireland from 1850, and had continued to do so\r\nuntil the ballot made the country a prey to self-seeking political\r\nagitators.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone considered that if you gave a scoundrel a vote it made him\r\ninto a philanthropist, whereas events proved it made him an eager\r\naccessory of murder, outrage, and every other crime.\r\n\r\nYet this happened after Fenianism had practically died out in the early\r\nseventies.\r\n\r\nI myself heard Mr. Gladstone say that landlords had been weighed in the\r\nbalance and had not been found wanting, for the bad ones were\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\nNone the less were they and their representatives delivered over to\r\ntheir natural opponents, who were egged on by the Land League and by its\r\ntacit or active supporters in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nEmphatically I repeat the assertion that neither Mr. Parnell nor the\r\nLand League would have been formidable without the active help of Mr.\r\nGladstone.\r\n\r\nBefore 1870 Kerry used to be represented by gentlemen of the county. The\r\npresent members in 1904 are an attorney's clerk, an assistant\r\nschoolmaster, a Dublin baker, and a fourth of about the same class.\r\n\r\nThis was no more foreseen by the landlords when the ballot was\r\nintroduced any more than we anticipated the way in which we were to be\r\nplundered. Many considered that the confiscation of the Irish Church,\r\nwhich had been established since the reign of Elizabeth, was an inroad\r\ninto the rights of property very likely to be followed up by further\r\naggressions, but we never looked for such a wholesale violation as\r\nensued.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of 1870 no tenant could be turned out without being paid a\r\nsum averaging a fourth of the fee-simple in addition to being paid for\r\nhis improvements, and there the most observant of us thought the worst\r\nhad been reached.\r\n\r\nWhen the Act of 1881 was passed, I met Lord Spencer, one of the authors\r\nof it, and said to him:--\r\n\r\n'This Act will have as much effect in settling Ireland as throwing a cup\r\nof dirty water into the Thames would have in creating a flood.'\r\n\r\nMy words were soon proved right, for the tenants, having obtained half\r\nthe landlord's property by it, thought that by well working their voting\r\nand shooting powers they would get the remainder.\r\n\r\nI have been getting away from my own experiences to give my own\r\nconvictions. When you have meditated for twenty years amid the ruins of\r\nwhat you had been building up all your life long and know that it is due\r\nto Irish outrage and English misrule, there is a temptation to speak\r\nplainly on breaking silence.\r\n\r\nThe year 1878 was a wet year and yielded a bad harvest; 1879 was worse.\r\nThe prosperity of Ireland depends on its harvest, and starvation is the\r\nopportunity of the lying agitator.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 1880, I gave evidence before the Royal Commission on\r\nAgriculture, being mainly examined by the president, the Duke of\r\nRichmond and Gordon, others on the board being Lord Carlingford, Mr.\r\nStansfeld, afterwards Lord, Mr. Joseph Cowen, and Mr. Mitchell Henry.\r\n\r\nHere are some of my statements on a then experience of thirty-one\r\nyears:--\r\n\r\n'The expenditure by landlords on farm buildings is as great in Ireland\r\nas in Scotland.'\r\n\r\n'In the exceptional state of things I strongly disapprove of\r\ntenant-right in Ireland, which, as Lord Palmerston said, is landlord\r\nwrong.'\r\n\r\n'Small holdings are a very bad thing in Ireland where they are not mixed\r\nwith large holdings.'\r\n\r\n'The distress in Kerry is considerable, but has been considerably\r\nexaggerated.'\r\n\r\n'Every tenant in Ireland has six months to redeem after he is evicted.'\r\n\r\n'I have never known a man leave a farm unless compelled.'\r\n\r\n'I contradict the statement that tenants make improvements which tend to\r\nincrease the letting value of the land.'\r\n\r\n'You pay four times as much for spade tillage as for ploughing by\r\nhorse.'\r\n\r\n'Bad farming in Ireland is due to want of education and to the enhanced\r\nsubdivision of the land. When the farmer gets higher up the social scale\r\nhe will have more sense than to make beggars of his children by\r\nsubdivision.'\r\n\r\n'Distress has not produced the discontent.'\r\n\r\n'Almost more land has been sold in Kerry than in any county in Ireland.'\r\n\r\nThree months later, in my evidence before the Irish Land Act Commission,\r\nin answer to the Chairman, I stated that in my opinion it was simply\r\nimpossible to arbitrate on rent. I had two tenants of my own whose\r\nyearly rent was £20 and whose valuation was £20. One of them in 1880\r\nsold £135 worth of pigs and butter, and the other man's children were\r\nassisted in charity from my house, though both had equal means of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nI also pointed out that there were then 300,000 occupiers of land in\r\nIreland, whose holdings were under £8 Poor Law valuation, and these\r\noccupiers when their potatoes failed had nothing but relief works,\r\nstarvation, or emigration. To give them their whole rent would not meet\r\nthe difficulty.\r\n\r\nI submitted a scheme of purchase, in which Baron Dowse was greatly\r\ninterested, and I suggested that all holdings under £4 a year should be\r\nejected at Petty Sessions, because it was a great hardship for the\r\ntenant of such a holding to have £2, 10s. costs put upon him.\r\n\r\nI ended with:--\r\n\r\n'There is a case in this county in connection with which there is likely\r\nto be very considerable disturbance. A man had a farm put up for sale\r\nand a Nationalist bought it at a very low figure, on the understanding\r\nthat he was to keep it for the man's family; but as soon as he got it he\r\nturned Conservative and kept it.'\r\n\r\n  BARON DOWSE--'Turned what?'\r\n\r\n  MYSELF--'Conservative.'\r\n\r\n  BARON DOWSE--'Rogue, I would say. You would not say that Conservatives\r\n  are rogues?'\r\n\r\nSince that was a debatable point on which the Commission had no\r\njurisdiction to inquire, I returned no answer.\r\n\r\nAs the distress was alluded to above, I may lighten the recent\r\nseriousness of my observations by an anecdote on the topic.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Duchess of Marlborough organised a fund for supplying the\r\npeople with meal. The Dublin Mansion House did the same, but their meal\r\nwas of a coarser description.\r\n\r\nA Blasquet Islander was asked how he was getting on, and made answer:--\r\n\r\n'Illigant, glory be to the Saints. We're eating the Duchess, and feeding\r\ntwo pigs on the Mansion House.'\r\n\r\nThis recalls the story of the Englishman who inquired of a Kerry man\r\nwhich measure of English legislation had proved most beneficial for\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n'The Famine (of 1879) was the best, beyond a shadow of doubt,' was the\r\nreply, 'for I fattened and sold ninety fine turkeys on the strength of\r\nit.'\r\n\r\nIn 1880 some Kerry men did a very good stroke of business. They sent a\r\ncargo of potatoes from Killorglin to Scotland and brought them back as\r\nimported Champion seed, selling them for six times the original price.\r\n\r\nAbout this period Mr. Leeson-Marshall, who had been away from Kerry and\r\ncoming back found some cottages near Milltown still only half built,\r\nobserved:--\r\n\r\n'Good God, aren't those houses finished yet?'\r\n\r\n'Well, sor,' was the reply, 'the contract's finished but the houses\r\naren't.'\r\n\r\nAnd it has been my life-long experience that ninety-five per cent, of\r\nall the penalties in contracts are worthless, as the contractors\r\nthemselves are only too well aware.\r\n\r\nBeing a land agent, I wish to provide some account from another pen of\r\nmy stewardship, for which said stewardship I was falsely called 'the\r\nmost rack-renting agent in Ireland.'\r\n\r\nOut of Mr. Finlay Dun's book, from which I have previously quoted, I\r\ncondense the following from the chapter he devoted to the estates for\r\nwhich I was agent.\r\n\r\nHe observes that in 1881 my firm had the supervision of eighty-eight\r\nestates, upwards of three thousand farming tenants, and annually\r\ncollected rents to the value of a quarter of a million sterling. From\r\nthe particulars I furnished him he deduces:--\r\n\r\n'So recently as the end of November the Lady Day rents had been well\r\npaid up; old arrears had been reduced; on two estates in the Court of\r\nChancery £6000 had been collected with only a few shillings in default.\r\nDairy farmers prospering had been particularly well able to pay rents\r\nand other claims. More recent rent collections, unfortunately, were not\r\nso satisfactory. Tenants generally had earned the money, but had not\r\nbeen allowed to pay it over.\r\n\r\n'Many of the low-rented estates were badly farmed and the tenantry in\r\nlow water. On the higher rented, the struggle for existence had brought\r\nout extra industry and energy and led to fair success.'\r\n\r\nThe following provided an apt illustration:--\r\n\r\n'Mr. Gould Adams of Kilmachill had a small estate on the north side of a\r\nhill rented at 20s. an acre; the rents were paid up, the tenants doing\r\nwell. On the southern aspect of the same hill, with better land, at the\r\ndevoutly desiderated Griffith's valuation, which was 16s. 4d., the\r\ntenants were invariably hard up, some of them two years in arrears. All\r\ntenants had free sale, averaging five years' rent.\r\n\r\n'The larger proprietors, as a rule, were most helpful and liberal to\r\ntheir tenants. Where improvements were not effected or initiated by the\r\nlandlords, they were seldom done at all. There had often been\r\nconsiderable difficulty in overcoming the prejudice and \"the\r\nrest-and-be-thankful\" spirit both of landlords and tenants.\r\n\r\n'On Sir George Colthurst's Ballyvourney estate, twenty miles east of\r\nKillarney, under Mr. Hussey's auspices about £30,000 had been expended\r\nin draining, building, and roadmaking. The economic value of many\r\nholdings had been doubled, although the rents had only been increased\r\nfive per cent., and subsequently the Commissioners fixed the rents at 25\r\nper cent. less than they had been fifty years earlier.\r\n\r\n'The extending village of Mill Street had been in great measure\r\nreconstructed by his exertions.\r\n\r\n'The Land League having enforced non-payment of rent, the obligation to\r\nmeet other debts was weakened. Although there was more money than usual\r\nin the hands of the farming community, shopkeepers were not so willingly\r\nand promptly paid as formerly. Want of security checked the improved\r\nbusiness which should have set in after a good harvest. The Land League\r\nagitation generally originated with the publicans, small shopkeepers,\r\nand bankrupt farmers, rather than with the actual land occupiers. For\r\npeace and protection, many pay their subscription to the League and\r\nallow their names to be enrolled. The intimidation and 'boycotting,'\r\nwhich was so widely had recourse to, rendered it dangerous for either\r\nfarmers or tradesmen to make a stand against the mob. With Sam Weller it\r\nwas regarded expedient to shout with the biggest crowd.'\r\n\r\nThus wrote a critical visitor keenly surveying the situation in no\r\nprejudiced spirit, having gone on a visit to Ireland to inquire into the\r\nsubjects of land tenure and estate management.\r\n\r\nIn his next chapter is a tribute to Lord Kenmare, 'a kind and\r\nconsiderate landlord, united to his people by strong ties of race and\r\ncreed, residing for a great part of the year on his estates, ready with\r\npurse and influence to advance the interests of his neighbourhood. On\r\nhis mansion and on the town of Killarney, since his accession to the\r\nproperty in 1871, he has spent £100,000. At his own expense he has\r\nerected a town hall, and improved and beautified Killarney. Within the\r\nlast twenty years £10,000 of arrears have been written off. From last\r\nyear's rents ten to twenty per cent, was deducted. During the last few\r\nyears of distress, £15,000 has been borrowed for draining and other\r\nimprovements; regular work has thus been found for the labourer; on such\r\noutlay in many instances no percentage has been charged. Since 1870,\r\nthree hundred labourers have been comfortably housed and provided with\r\ngardens or allotments varying from one to three pounds annually.'\r\n\r\nI could not myself so tersely put the situation to-day as by quoting\r\nthis contemporary narrative, the facts for which I supplied.\r\n\r\nOnce more let me draw upon Mr. Finlay Dun. 'Unmindful of all this\r\nconsistent liberality, ungrateful for the great efforts to improve his\r\npoorer neighbours, popular prejudice has been roused against Lord\r\nKenmare; it has been impossible to collect rents; threatening letters\r\nhave been sent to him. Mortified with the apparent fruitlessness of his\r\nhumane endeavours he has been compelled to leave Killarney House.\r\n\r\n'His agent, Mr. Hussey, who for twenty years has been earnestly and\r\nintelligently labouring to improve Irish agriculture, to bring more\r\ncapital to bear on it, to render it more profitable, and has, besides,\r\nmost energetically striven to elevate and house more decently the\r\nlabouring population, has also brought down on himself the odium of the\r\npowers that be. For months he has had to travel armed and guarded by a\r\ncouple of constables; now he has thought it discreet to leave the\r\ncountry.'\r\n\r\nThis, however, is erroneous. I only took a house for my family in London\r\nfor the winter, and was backwards and forwards between Kerry and the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nAgainst all this let me set another quotation. In _New York Tablet_ for\r\n1880, a letter from Daniel O'Shea, who stated that for a large number of\r\nyears he was a resident in Killarney.\r\n\r\n'Among the most prominent tyrants was Lord Kenmare, who has so recently\r\nsurpassed himself and his antecedents in despotism. He is a lineal\r\ndescendant of the original land thief, Valentine Brown, who was a\r\nspecial pet of 'the Virgin Queen' Bess, and strange to relate, this\r\ndescendant of that Brown is a much-favoured pet of John Brown's Queen.\r\nLet me explain that he lives with the Queen in London where he holds the\r\nposition of chamberlain (_sic_) ... At Aghadoe House now resides that\r\nruthless Sam Hussey. Allow me to give you an outline of this heartless\r\nfellow's antecedents. This Hussey is of English origin and was formerly\r\na cattle-dealer, and practised usury as far back as 1845. If all Ireland\r\nwere to be searched for a similar despot he would not be found. He is a\r\nregular anti-Christ and Orangeman at heart, and, in fact, he acts as\r\nagent for all the bankrupt landlords in Kerry. An English-Irish landlord\r\nis an alien in heart, a despot by instinct, an absentee by inclination;\r\nand all the foul confederacy of landlordism in Kerry is always in direct\r\nopposition to the cause of Ireland.'\r\n\r\nThere is a copious mendacity about that effusion which makes me think\r\nthe real mission of the writer should have been to become an Irish\r\nMember of Parliament. His powers of misrepresentation would have raised\r\nhim to an eminence among obstructionists.\r\n\r\nAfter all, scurrilous denunciation never affected me. His life by Sir\r\nWemyss Reid reveals how Mr. W.E. Forster flinched under the vituperation\r\nlevelled at his head. But he was not an Irishman, least of all a Kerry\r\nman, and so he never felt the fun of the fray, the grim earnest of the\r\nfight which made me set my teeth and give as good as I received. Indeed,\r\nI'll take my oath no man had the better of me, either in bandying words\r\nor yet in acts, so long as they were open and above-board, but it has\r\nalways been the way of sedition and conspiracy to hit below the belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMURDER, OUTRAGE AND CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce launched upon memories of those horrible perpetrations by so-called\r\nChristians, which disgraced alike my native country and all Christendom\r\n(because the criminals nominally worshipped the same God, and professed\r\nreverence to Him), I could enumerate instances until I had filled a\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nYou know how the Ghost told Hamlet that he could a tale unfold, whose\r\nlightest word would harrow up his soul. Why, I could tell five score,\r\nand still not have exhausted the roll of crime.\r\n\r\nAs my experience is mainly connected with Kerry, it is\r\ncharacteristically Irish for me to start with an example from County\r\nCork. The outrage was on the Rathcole estate of Sir George Colthurst.\r\nThe rental was £1500, and the landlord had expended £10,000 on\r\nimprovements, so that it was not to be wondered that the labourers\r\nshould meet to celebrate their employer's marriage.\r\n\r\nNor to any one knowing Ireland was it surprising that the Land League\r\nshould have despatched one of their well-armed bands to fire on them for\r\nso doing.\r\n\r\nThis was apparently a challenge to Kerry not to be outdone in barbarity\r\nby Cork, her neighbour and rival.\r\n\r\nKerry was quite equal to current demands on her inhumanity.\r\n\r\nA labourer of the M'Gillycuddys was visited by another Land League\r\ndetachment and had his ear, _à la_ Bulgaria, cut clean off to the bone,\r\nbecause he worked on a farm from which a tenant had been evicted.\r\n\r\nThe next night a small Protestant farmer near Tralee found his best cow\r\ntortured and killed because he had sold milk to the police.\r\n\r\nOn the same night a farmer's house was sacked because he had bought some\r\n'boycotted' hay.\r\n\r\nStill on the same night, at Millstreet, another Land League gang\r\nattacked a house, one of the Land League police being killed, and one of\r\nthe Crown police wounded.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all law save Land League law was for a time at an end in\r\nMunster.\r\n\r\nAt one Kerry Assize, a criminal caught by four policemen in the very act\r\nof breaking into a house, was acquitted, and at the Cork Assize the\r\nCrown Prosecutor, after half a dozen acquittals, announced he would not\r\ncontinue the farce of putting criminals on their trial.\r\n\r\nI mentioned boycotting just now, but I am tempted to pause, because a\r\nnew generation that knows not Parnellism, nor the extent of crime in\r\nthat unhappy period, may not be aware of the origin of the term.\r\n\r\nCaptain Boycott was agent for Lord Erne's Mayo estates, and laid out the\r\nwhole of his capital £6000, in improving and stocking his own property.\r\nBecause, in the course of his duty, he served some ejectment notices, he\r\nwas denounced by the Land League, his farm servants were terrorised into\r\nleaving his employment, and when he imported fifty labourers from the\r\nnorth of Ireland to save his crops, the Government had to despatch a\r\nsmall army corps of troops and constabulary to protect them. So great\r\nwas the power of the League, that even in Dublin the landlord of a hotel\r\ndeclined to let him stop more than twenty-four hours in the house, as he\r\nwas threatened if he ventured to harbour him. For the protection of his\r\nlife and no more, the unfortunate gentleman had to leave the country.\r\n\r\nBaron Dowse said in charging the Grand Jury of the Connaught Western\r\nAssize, that this case had 'excited the wonder and amazement of a great\r\npart of the United Kingdom and the sorrow of a considerable portion of\r\nIreland.' Very soon the name of Boycott was given to the approved method\r\nof actively sending a man to Coventry, or threatening his life and\r\nproperty as well as refusing to permit him to be supplied with even the\r\nbare necessities of existence.\r\n\r\nBaron Dowse, a man who had no fear of unmanly criminals, justly styled\r\nthis a reign of terror.\r\n\r\nKerry is divided into six Poor Law Unions, three of them--Kenmare,\r\nCahirciveen and Dingle--are very poor districts; but there was\r\npractically not an outrage in them. Killarney, Tralee and Listowel are\r\nrich by comparison, Tralee being the richest of the three, and\r\nCastleisland the wealthiest portion of the district. There were nearly\r\nas many outrages there as in the whole of the rest of the country, which\r\nshows that poverty was not the cause.\r\n\r\nI was in and out of Castleisland, but though I had a sheaf of\r\nthreatening letters, I never met with any insults or received a threat\r\nto my face.\r\n\r\nOnly once did I overhear any hostile mutterings. This was when I was\r\ndriving out of Tralee, and my coachman stopped to give a message in the\r\ndusk at a house on the outskirts of the town.\r\n\r\nSuddenly two or three men came up, and one said:--\r\n\r\n'Now's the time to settle old Hussey.'\r\n\r\nOld Hussey--to use their accurate nomenclature--popped his head out of\r\nthe window, and also his right hand which held a most serviceable\r\nrevolver and invited them to come on.\r\n\r\nThey did not. In fact they scattered with a rapidity which proved they\r\nhad not imbibed enough whisky to affect their legs or give them courage.\r\n\r\nThis will show that my business--to collect what was due to the\r\nlandlords I represented--was not always agreeable work or always easy.\r\nBut my duty was to get in rents, and so I got them, whenever I could.\r\n\r\nThe tenants did not all pay direct, for many were far too frightened.\r\nQuite a number, even of the Roman Catholics, used to send the money\r\nthrough the Protestant clergy.\r\n\r\nHow they settled this in the confessional I do not know, possibly it was\r\na trifle they did not consider worth troubling the priest with.\r\n\r\nThree tenants on Lord Kenmare's estate came into my office on one\r\noccasion, and said they would like to pay their rent, but were afraid of\r\nthe Land League.\r\n\r\nI treated their fears as arrant nonsense, but told them to come and\r\nargue it out with me in my own room.\r\n\r\nSo soon as they could not be seen by any one they paid up.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days an armed party went to their houses and shot the three\r\nin their legs.\r\n\r\nOne man's life was despaired of for some time, but finally they all\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThis outrage was a rather late one, because the Land League latterly\r\ndecided to shoot objectionable characters only in the legs, because\r\nthough a fuss was made at the time, if a man was killed it was soon\r\nforgotten afterwards, whereas a lame man was a lifelong testimony to\r\ntheir power.\r\n\r\nThere is a man hobbling about Castleisland to this day, who was peppered\r\nin this comparatively humanitarian way. I am quite sure he would say\r\nsuch a comparison had proved odious.\r\n\r\nJudge Barry very truly said that a thatched cabin on a mountain-side was\r\nnot much of a place of defence, and if the tenant was supposed to have\r\npaid his rent, he would be told to run out with probably three men\r\nstanding at the door to shoot him. That was terrorism as inculcated by\r\nthe so-called friends of Ireland.\r\n\r\nMr. Forster in his plucky speech to the crowd at Tullamore, said:--\r\n\r\n'I went when I was at Tulla to the workhouse, and there saw a poor\r\nfellow lying in bed, the doctors around him, with a blue light over his\r\nface that made me feel that the doctors were not right, when they told\r\nme he might get over it. I felt sure that he must die, and I see this\r\nmorning that he has died. But why did that man die? He was a poor lone\r\nfarmer. I believe he had paid his rent--I believe he had committed that\r\ncrime. He thought it his duty to pay. Fifteen or sixteen men broke into\r\nhis house in the middle of the night, pulled him out of his bed and told\r\nhim they would punish him. He himself, lying in his death agony as it\r\nwere, told me the story. He said, \"My wife went down on her knees and\r\nsaid, 'Here are five helpless children, will you kill their father?'\"\r\nThey took him out, they discharged a gun filled with shot into his leg,\r\nso closely that they shattered his leg.'\r\n\r\nNow there were dozens of instances of that kind of thing in Kerry.\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell started the whole vile crusade, when at Ennis he gave the\r\nadvice to shun any man who had bid for a farm from which a tenant had\r\nbeen evicted.\r\n\r\n'Shun him in the street, in the shop, in the marketplace, even in the\r\nplace of worship, as if he were a leper of old.'\r\n\r\nHis words were implicitly obeyed, and outrage followed mere boycotting\r\ntill the rapid succession of crimes prevented each one having its full\r\neffect in horrifying civilised Europe.\r\n\r\nA very bad case occurred in Millstreet.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Haggerty was a large farmer and shopkeeper. There was no\r\nobjection to him, except that he declined to join the Land League, for\r\nwhich his shop was boycotted, which he told me meant the loss of a\r\nthousand a year to him, but the League failed to boycott his farm,\r\nbecause he was too good an employer.\r\n\r\nHe was fired at coming into Millstreet, and the outrage had been so\r\nopenly planned, that it was talked of on the preceding evening in every\r\nwhisky store.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he was leaving Millstreet station, about a mile from\r\nthe town, and when about twenty yards from the station he was fired at\r\nand forty grains of shot lodged in the back of his head, neck, and body.\r\nAs it was twilight, a railway porter obligingly held up his lantern to\r\ngive the miscreants a better view of their victim.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of most honourable and upright character, who had worked\r\nhis way up, and he has now regained his popularity. He started as a\r\nclerk in quite a small way, and must now be worth a very large sum of\r\nmoney. I was instrumental in getting him made a magistrate, and I have\r\nthe greatest respect for him.\r\n\r\nI regard this as a decidedly serious example, because of the popularity\r\nof the victim, and also because he had offended no one by word or deed.\r\nStill, there were, of course, many instances which were even more\r\noutrageous.\r\n\r\nA farmer, name of Brown, was shot at Castleisland. Two men were arrested\r\nfor the murder, and were twice tried before Cork juries. The first\r\ndisagreed, but the second found them guilty.\r\n\r\nA subscription was made up for the families of the two murderers, to\r\nwhich contributions were made by the leading shopkeepers of several\r\nneighbouring towns. For several years afterwards, Mrs. Brown could not\r\nget a man to dig her potatoes, nor a woman to milk her cows, although\r\nshe had tendered no evidence at the trial, and it was clearly proved\r\nthat Brown had given no cause of offence.\r\n\r\nBut, as a Land Leaguer said to me, it was suspected that he might be in\r\na position to do so.\r\n\r\nRed Indians, or any other barbarians you can think of, would not have\r\nbeen guilty of wreaking vengeance on the widow of an innocent murdered\r\nman, nor of endowing the wives of his assassins.\r\n\r\nHere is another murder story.\r\n\r\nA caretaker on an evicted farm on the property of Lord Cork, near\r\nKanturk, was murdered for taking charge of it.\r\n\r\nThe evicted tenant had owed eleven years' rent.\r\n\r\nLord Cork had agreed to accept one year's rent in full acquittal, and so\r\ngood a landlord was he, that the neighbours of the debtor offered to\r\nmake up the amount to that sum.\r\n\r\nThe tenant firmly declined to pay, because he said another year would\r\nbring him within the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nSo then he had to be evicted.\r\n\r\nTwo men were clearly identified as having perpetrated the unprovoked\r\ncrime of assassinating the temporary occupant of the property, and were\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nThe Gladstonian Attorney-General, in order to curry popularity, declined\r\nto challenge the jury, when the first man was put on his trial.\r\nConsequently three cousins of the prisoner were impanelled, the jury\r\ndisagreed, and the wretch bolted to America that same night.\r\n\r\nThe second man, though less guilty, was duly tried before a challenged\r\njury, and not only sentenced but hanged.\r\n\r\nHe was the organiser of outrages for Cork, and his brother held the\r\nsimilar delectable office for Kerry. A good deal of the impunity with\r\nwhich crime was committed was due to the change in the jury laws, by\r\nwhich so low a class of man was summoned into the box, that criminals\r\nbegan to consider conviction impossible. To my mind it was quite worth\r\nthe consideration of the Cabinet of the time, whether trial by jury\r\nought not to be abolished in Ireland--indeed, even to-day, I can see few\r\nreasons for its retention and many for its abolition.\r\n\r\nAnyhow in the bad times I am now dealing with, to send persons for trial\r\nbefore a jury was but to advertise the weakness of the law.\r\n\r\nTwo men at Tralee were suspected of having paid their rent to me, and in\r\nspite of their assurances that they were quite innocent and had not paid\r\na farthing for two years, it was necessary for the police to escort them\r\nafter nightfall to their homes about four miles away, and to advise them\r\nnot to venture into the town for a long while after.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst features, however, of all this terrible period was that\r\nhelpless girls and women were victims as well as men, I know of a case\r\nwhere some ruffians entered the house of a family at night, went into\r\nthe bedroom of one of the girls, seized her violently, forced her on her\r\nknees, and held her in that position while one of the gang cut off her\r\nhair with shears, and then poured a quantity of hot tar on her head\r\nbefore entering the bedroom of her sister to do the same.\r\n\r\nA similar fate befell two girls named Murphy merely because they were\r\nsuspected of speaking to a policeman.\r\n\r\nA man named Finlay was boycotted and then shot dead, and the neighbours\r\njeered and laughed at his wife, when in her agony she was wringing her\r\nhands in grief.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman went into the street and knelt down crying:--\r\n\r\n'The curse of God rest upon Father ---- for being the cause of my\r\nhusband's murder.'\r\n\r\nThe priest had denounced him from the altar on the previous Sunday.\r\n\r\n'Carding' has always been a favourite Irish form of physically\r\ninsinuating to a man that he is not exactly popular. It consists of a\r\nwooden board with nails in it being drawn down the naked flesh of a\r\nman's face and body. This foul torture was often heard of, and it has\r\nbeen whispered that women and even girls have been the victims of this\r\natrocity.\r\n\r\nThe merciful man is proverbially merciful to his beast, and those who\r\nshowed mercy to neither man nor woman had none on the dumb animals owned\r\nby their victims.\r\n\r\nA valuable Spanish ass belonging to Mr. M'Cowan of Tralee was saturated\r\nwith paraffin, set on fire, and horribly burned.\r\n\r\nA farmer named Lambert found the shoulder of a heifer had been smashed\r\nby some blunt instrument like a hammer. I myself had a couple of cows\r\nkilled and salted.\r\n\r\nIndeed cattle outrages became incidents of nightly occurrence. Tenants\r\nin all disturbed counties, besides having their houses burnt, saw their\r\ncattle so horribly mutilated that the poor dumb creatures had to be\r\nkilled to put them out of their misery. The Society for the Prevention\r\nof Cruelty to Animals would have no chance of obtaining general support\r\namong the lower classes in Kerry, where beasts belonging to your enemy\r\nare simply regarded as so many goods and chattels, to be as badly\r\ndamaged as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing that the Irish and the Italian are the two most\r\npoetic and most sensitive races of Europe, and also are the two which\r\nexhibit the greatest indifference to the sufferings of dumb animals.\r\n\r\nThe distress in Kerry, of course, in the winter of 1879 had been as\r\ngreat as in the more famous famine, and I have heard the theory advanced\r\nin a London drawing-room that physical suffering renders uneducated\r\npeople indifferent to any torture endured by animals. Personally, I\r\nshould have thought a fellow feeling made us wondrous kind.\r\n\r\nReverting to matters with which I had more personal connection, an\r\ninteresting episode occurred in June 1881, when The O'Donoghue moved the\r\nadjournment of the House of Commons to force a debate upon the subject\r\nof Lord Kenmare's estate, and I wrote a letter in the _Times_ in reply,\r\nfrom which may be condensed the following facts:--\r\n\r\nOn the Cork estate, from 1878 to 1881, the evictions did not average one\r\nfor each year for every two hundred tenants.\r\n\r\nOn the Limerick estate for five years there have been no evictions.\r\n\r\nOn the Kerry estate, since he succeeded (in 1871), Lord Kenmare has\r\nexpended £67,115 on drainage, road-making, and building cottages. The\r\nevictions have been about one in five hundred in every half year. The\r\nabatements, allowances, and expenditure in 1878, '79, '80, and '81,\r\nexclusive of what was spent on the house and demesne, were, £33,645, and\r\nI am under the mark when I say that, altogether, for these years of\r\ndistress, Lord Kenmare spent more on his Kerry estates than he received\r\nout of it; yet for this, Land League meetings were held on his estate,\r\nand he was denounced in Parliament. The week that the Land League\r\ncompelled Lord Kenmare to discontinue his employment to labourers, the\r\nweekly labour bill was £460.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to trouble readers with any further correspondence on a\r\ntopic on which no one could answer me except by abuse, which is no\r\nargument; nor will I inflict any of the letters in which Mr. Sexton was\r\nclearly proved in the wrong when he misrepresented the case of Pat\r\nMurphy of Rath.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the state of affairs, in Millstreet--a mere\r\nvillage--there were thirty cases of nocturnal raid in the month of\r\nAugust 1881, even while it was engaging the attention of Mr. T.O.\r\nPlunkett, R.M., Mr. French, chief of the detective department, two\r\nsub-inspectors, thirty-five constabulary, and fifty men of the 80th\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\nIn the _Daily Telegraph_, with reference to the murder of Gallivan, near\r\nCastleisland, this remark appeared in a leader:--\r\n\r\n'Horror-stricken humanity demands that an example be speedily made of\r\nthe truculent and merciless ruffian who perpetrated this outrage.'\r\n\r\nI quoted this in a letter the editor published, adding:--\r\n\r\n'A few weeks after that occasion an old man named Flynn was shot within\r\ntwo miles of the place, because he paid his rent. His leg has since been\r\namputated.'\r\n\r\nThen I gave the following horrible case:--\r\n\r\nOn Sunday night the Land League police went to the house of a man named\r\nDan Dooling, who lived within a mile of Gallivan's house, and within one\r\nmile of Castleisland, and because he paid his rent on getting a\r\nreduction of thirty per cent., he was taken out and shot in the thigh.\r\nHis wife, who was only three days after her confinement, pleaded for\r\nmercy on this account, but these lynch law authorities were deaf to the\r\nappeal for mercy, and she did not recover the shock of the entry of\r\nthese 'moonlight' Thugs. This man could have identified his assailants,\r\nbut he did not dare.\r\n\r\nA good fellow called M'Auliffe, whose arm was shot off, could have done\r\nthe same. The poor chap could be seen walking about with one arm,\r\ndeprived of the means of earning his bread, and no doubt moralising over\r\nthe state of the law, which would compensate him for the loss of his\r\ncow, if he had one, but gave him nothing for the loss of his arm.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, November 18, 1881, two tenants, named Cronin and one O'Keefe,\r\nholding land from Lord Kenmare, came into my office in Killarney.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe, an old man of seventy, was the spokesman, and said:--\r\n\r\n'If you plase, sorr, we have the rint in our pocket, and would be glad\r\nto pay it if it were not for the fear that we have of being shot.'\r\n\r\nTo my lasting regret, I replied:--\r\n\r\n'There is no danger. You must pay.'\r\n\r\nThey did, and on the Sunday week following, a band of marauders, headed\r\nby fife and drum, went to the houses of these men, and shot them in the\r\npresence of their families. All the flesh on the lower part of O'Keefe's\r\nlegs was shot away, one of the Cronins was shot in the knee, but the\r\nother in the body.\r\n\r\nEverybody in the neighbourhood knew the perpetrators of this ghastly\r\noutrage, but said:--\r\n\r\n'What use would there be in our telling, as the jury would acquit them,\r\nand we should be shot?'\r\n\r\nThen came this announcement, which caused great excitement in\r\nKillarney:--\r\n\r\n'In consequence of the difficulty of getting his rents, the Earl of\r\nKenmare has decided to leave the country for the present. All the\r\nlabourers employed on the estate are discharged, as well as some of the\r\ngamekeepers.'\r\n\r\nMy own opinion was that he showed great wisdom in abandoning the\r\nungrateful locality where only man, debased by the Land League, was\r\nvile.\r\n\r\nOutside my own folk, I found the people stiffer and less affable than\r\nformerly; but at no time had I any difficulty in obtaining or keeping\r\ndomestic servants, though my wife got the majority from the\r\nneighbourhood of Edenburn.\r\n\r\nI used to sit, on and off, on the bench as regularly as most of the\r\nother magistrates, whenever, indeed, my business permitted me to do so,\r\nand to my face no one ventured to abuse me.\r\n\r\nQuite late in the bad times when I wanted a decree of ejectment against\r\na fellow, the chairman, desiring to make peace, explained that his\r\nhesitation was entirely on my account, to save me from danger.\r\n\r\nI replied that I had not quailed all those years, and I was too old to\r\nbegin; so I had my decree, and that fellow's threats were as\r\ncontemptuously treated as all the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Bank had a decree against a tenant of mine, and, having sold him\r\nout, entered into possession and put in a caretaker.\r\n\r\nHe was in occupation about eight hours, when he grew so frightened that\r\nhe ran away. The tenant then went back into possession as a caretaker,\r\nwhom nobody dared dislodge, and he promptly went to the Tralee Board of\r\nGuardians to obtain a pound a week as an evicted tenant.\r\n\r\nAt that time two-thirds of the poor-rate was paid by the landlord. When\r\nthe tenancy was over £4 a year, they had to allow each tenant half the\r\nrate he paid; when it was under this sum, they had to pay the whole of\r\nit, and, of course, all the rates for land in their own occupation.\r\n\r\nThus the Board of Guardians were utilising the money of the landlords in\r\norder to remunerate the men who were robbing them of their property.\r\n\r\nIf a tenant--who generally had some money--was evicted, a notice was\r\nserved on the relieving officer to provide him with a conveyance, in\r\nwhich he was taken to the poorhouse; but if a farmer evicted a\r\nlabourer--who had, perhaps, nothing but the suit of clothes in which he\r\nstood up--he was allowed to walk to the poorhouse as best he might, and,\r\nwhen he got there, he obtained no special relief.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the passing of the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act offered\r\nanother opportunity to the Government for striking a severe blow, but it\r\nwas frittered away, although, before it became law, many of the leaders\r\nof disorder left the country, dreading its provisions.\r\n\r\nInstead, the isolated arrests revealed that the criminals were provided\r\nwith special accommodation and superior fare.\r\n\r\nA district officer, asked by Lord Spencer for his views on the Coercion\r\nAct, replied:--\r\n\r\n'The only coercion I can perceive, your Excellency, is that people\r\naccustomed to live on potatoes and milk are forced to feed on salmon and\r\nwine.'\r\n\r\nThe last outrage I intend to mention in this chapter was a very\r\nremarkable one.\r\n\r\nThere was a contest for the chairmanship of the Tralee Board of\r\nGuardians. The Land League put forward a candidate who was at the time\r\nan inmate of Kilmainham gaol. The landlords, who at this earlier stage\r\nstill had some power, conceived that the residence of the Home Ruler\r\nwould not facilitate his control over the Board, and chose a candidate\r\nwhose abode was not only more adjacent, but whose movements were\r\nunfettered.\r\n\r\nThe voting was even, until Mr. A.E. Herbert came into the room and gave\r\nhis casting vote against the involuntary tenant of the Kilmainham\r\nhostelry. For this he was murdered three days later, and by the crime\r\nthey hoped to ensure that on the next occasion the landlords would\r\nabstain from voting at all.\r\n\r\nThat murder of Mr. Arthur Herbert on his return from Petty Sessions at\r\nCastleisland was one of the worst, and as an exhibition of infernal\r\nhatred and vengeance it transcended the murders of Lord Mountmorres and\r\nLord Leitrim. It cannot be denied that Mr. Herbert committed acts of a\r\nharsh and overbearing character. He was a turbulent, headstrong man,\r\nbrave to rashness and foolhardiness, and too fond of proclaiming his\r\ncontempt for the people by whom he was surrounded. As a magistrate,\r\nsitting at Brosna Petty Sessions, he expressed his regret that he was\r\nnot in command of a force when a riot occurred in that village, when he\r\nwould have 'skivered the people with buckshot,' language brought under\r\nthe notice of the Lord Chancellor and the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of a clergyman, and lived at Killeentierna House with his\r\nmother, a venerable old lady over eighty, he being himself forty-five.\r\nHis income was estimated at about four hundred a year, and as his\r\nrelations with tenantry were not harmonious, he never went out without a\r\nsix-chambered revolver in his pocket. Physically he was very\r\nrobust--over five feet ten in height, and very corpulent. In his own\r\nneighbourhood he always was known as 'Mr. Arthur.'\r\n\r\nLeaving Castleisland about five in the afternoon, he was accompanied for\r\nabout a mile by the head constable, who then turned back. Mr. Herbert\r\nhad not proceeded a quarter of a mile further when he was felled by the\r\nassassins. The spot chosen was singularly open, no shelter being visible\r\nfor some distance. Several shots were heard by a labourer at work in a\r\nquarry, and when he came up he found Mr. Herbert lying on his face in\r\nthe road, quite dead, the earth about him being covered with pools of\r\nblood. The body was almost riddled with shot and bullets.\r\n\r\nThat night a further illustration of the vindictive ferocity of the\r\noutrage was given. The lawn in front of Killeentierna was patrolled\r\nregularly by some of the large body of police which at once occupied the\r\nhouse. On this lawn eleven lambs were grazing. At half-past two these\r\nwere seen by the police to be all right. At daybreak the eleven were\r\nfound stabbed with pitchforks--nine of them killed outright, and two\r\nwounded to death. This act, as wretched as it was daring, added a new\r\nhorror to the crime.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert's murder was received with such exuberant delight in Kerry\r\nthat my steward said to me:--\r\n\r\n'You would think, sir, that rent was abolished and the duty taken off\r\nwhisky.'\r\n\r\nConstabulary had for a long while to be told off to prevent his grave\r\nbeing desecrated.\r\n\r\nThat is a pretty tough outrage for optimistic philanthropists to\r\nconsider when they are addicted to announcing how far our generations\r\nhave progressed from barbarism.\r\n\r\nThe price of blood in Kerry was not high. For example, the men that\r\nmurdered FitzMaurice were paid £5 for the job, and they had never seen\r\nhim before. His family had to be under police protection for five years,\r\nand I managed to get £1000 subscribed for them in England, Mr. Froude\r\ntaking an enthusiastic and generous interest in a very sad case. The\r\nvictim left two daughters, who both married policemen.\r\n\r\nOne young and cheery Kerry landlord was very proud, about 1886, at the\r\nprice of forty shillings being offered for his life by the Land League,\r\nwhereas nearly all the others were only valued at half a sovereign\r\napiece.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, almost any one could have been shot at Castleisland\r\nif a sovereign were offered, for they cared no more for human life than\r\nfor that of a rat. Parnell himself would have been shot by any one of a\r\ncouple of dozen fellows willing to earn a dishonest living if a\r\nfive-pound note had been locally put upon his head. A patriotic\r\nphilanthropist, destitute of the bowels of compassion and of every\r\ndictate of humanity, might have saved a great deal of undeserved\r\nsuffering if he had made this donation towards his 'removal'--a pretty\r\neuphemism of Land League coinage.\r\n\r\nMost of that generation are dead, in gaol, or have emigrated. It would\r\ntake the deuce of a big sum to tempt any Castleislander to-day to commit\r\nmurder, except under provocation, and the same improvement is observable\r\nall over Ireland. I believe a hundred pounds might be put on the head of\r\nthe least popular agent or landlord, and he might walk unscathed without\r\npolice protection.\r\n\r\nAll that has been set forth in this chapter might be regarded as a heavy\r\nindictment of crime and disorder, but I cannot avoid adding one\r\nconfirmatory piece of evidence, as eloquent as it is accurate. This is\r\nthe fearful description of the state of Kerry which appears in Judge\r\nO'Brien's charge to the Grand Jury at the Assizes, founded, of course,\r\non the report of outrages submitted to him. It is impossible to guess in\r\nwhat stronger words his opinions would have been expressed if the total\r\nnumber of outrages committed had been laid before him; but it is well\r\nknown that only a few of those committed were reported, as, if the\r\ncriminals were taken up and identified, the victims would be likely to\r\nbe shot in revenge, while the guilty persons, tried by a sympathising\r\njury, would obtain acquittal and popular advertisement.\r\n\r\nThe charge was as follows:--\r\n\r\n'COLONEL CROSBIE AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY OF KERRY--I requested\r\nyour permission to defer any observations I was about to make to you, in\r\norder that I might have an opportunity of examining certain returns\r\nwhich had been made to me containing materials for forming a judgment\r\nupon the state of things in this county of which I was put in possession\r\nupon my arrival, and I was desirous of being afforded an opportunity of\r\nexamining these materials to try if I could discern whether, in the\r\nconsiderable lapse of time that has happened since the last Assizes, I\r\ncould see any reason to conclude that an improvement had taken place in\r\nthe state of things that has now so long existed in the County of Kerry,\r\nand other counties in the south of Ireland, to try if I could discern\r\nwhether lapse of time itself, the weariness of that state of things, if\r\nthe law and influences that lead persons to avoid violations of the law,\r\nor to follow the pursuits of industry, had led in the end to any\r\nfavourable change in the state of things; but I grieve to say that it is\r\nnot in my power, unfortunately, to announce that any change has taken\r\nplace. On the contrary, all the means of information that I possess lead\r\nto the unhappy conclusion that there is no improvement, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, there exists, even at this moment, a most extraordinary state\r\nof things--a state of things of an unprecedented description--nothing\r\nshort, in fact, of a state of open war with all forms of authority, and\r\neven, I may say without exaggeration, with the necessary institutions of\r\ncivilised life.\r\n\r\n'These returns present a picture of the County Kerry such as can hardly\r\nbe found in any country that has passed the confines of natural society\r\nand entered upon the duties and relations, and acknowledged the\r\nobligations, of civilised life. The law is defeated--perhaps I should\r\nrather say, has ceased to exist! Houses are attacked by night and day,\r\neven the midnight terror yielding to the noonday anxiety of crime!\r\nPerson and life are assailed! The terrified inmates are wholly unable to\r\ndo anything to protect themselves, and a state of terror and lawlessness\r\nprevails everywhere. Even some persons who possess means of information\r\nthat are not open to me, profess to discern in the signs of public\r\nfeeling, in the views of some hope and some fear, the expectation of\r\nsomething about to happen, something reaching far beyond partial, or\r\nlocal, or even agrarian, disturbance, and calculated to create a greater\r\ndegree of alarm than anything we have witnessed, or anything that has\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n'When I come to compare the official returns of crime with those of the\r\npreceding period, I find that the total number of offences in this\r\ncounty since the last Assizes is somewhat less in number, even\r\nconsiderably less in number, than in the corresponding or the preceding\r\nperiod of the former years. But the diminution of number affords no\r\nassurance or ground of improvement at all, because I find that the\r\ndiminution is accounted for entirely in the class of offences that\r\nacknowledges to some extent the power and influence of the law, namely,\r\nin threatening letters and notices, while the amount of open and actual\r\ncrime is greater than it was in the former period, showing that there is\r\nan increased confidence in impunity, and that menace has given place to\r\nthe deed. Within not more than ten days from the time that I am now\r\nspeaking, not less than four examples of midnight invasion of houses in\r\nthis county have occurred, accompanied with all the usual incidents of\r\ndisguises and arms, and the firing of shots, and violence threatened or\r\ncommitted; in one instance the outrage having been committed upon the\r\nresidence of a magistrate of this county, a man living with his family\r\nin his home, in the supposed delusive security of domestic life, of law,\r\nand respect for social station; and in another instance committed upon a\r\nhumble man, and encountered, I am glad to say, in that instance, with a\r\nbrave resistance, giving an example of courage which, if it were widely\r\nimitated, many of the evils that this country suffers from would no\r\nlonger exist.\r\n\r\n'I need not dwell upon the most aggravated instance of all which this\r\ncalendar of crime presents--one that is quite recent, and within the\r\nmemory of you all--the murder of Cornelius Murphy, a humble man, but one\r\nenjoying apparently the confidence and respect of all his neighbours,\r\nwho had done no harm to any person, who was not conscious of any\r\noffence, whose house was invaded at a still early hour of the evening,\r\nand before the daylight had departed, by a band of men that is shown to\r\nhave traversed a considerable distance of country, giving opportunities\r\nof recognition to many, and with hardly the pretext of an offence on his\r\npart, and in reality with the object of private plunder or private\r\nhostility--one of those motives that always take advantage of a state of\r\ndisturbance in order to gratify private ends--slain in his own house in\r\nthe presence of his own family. Certain persons, it would appear, have\r\nbeen arrested on a charge of complicity with this crime, and it may be\r\nthat this cruel and wicked crime may be the means of discovering other\r\ncrimes, and of leading in the end to the detection, if not to the\r\nconviction, of persons who have been connected in them, and those who\r\nrest in the supposed confidence of impunity may find the spell broken,\r\nmay find the light of information to reach them, and may find in the end\r\nthat the law will be able to prevail; because it must be in the\r\nexperience of many of you that it is unhappily in the power of a few\r\npersons who engage in this system of nightly invasion of houses to\r\nmultiply themselves, apparently by means of terror and intimidation,\r\nalthough at the same time there can be no doubt that, on account of\r\ninterval of distances, and for many such reasons, there must be many\r\nsuch combinations in this country, acting entirely independent of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n'No person can be at a loss to understand the misery and suffering that\r\narises from a state of crime; but perhaps all persons in the community\r\ndo not equally understand one form of consequence to material prosperity\r\nthat results from it. I have before me a document that contains most\r\nterribly significant evidence of mischief, alike to all classes of the\r\ncommunity, that results from crime and a state of social disturbance. I\r\nhave a return of malicious injuries which form the subject of\r\npresentment at these Assizes, in number, I understand, exceeding all\r\nformer precedent. There are no less than eighty-six presentments,\r\nrepresenting all forms of wicked outrage upon property, a tempest--I\r\nmight say without exaggeration, a tempest--of violence and crime that\r\nhas swept over a considerable portion of this county. The claims amount\r\nto £2700, with the result that the Grand Jury had presented upon a\r\ncertain part of this county £1250, exercising apparently the greatest\r\ncare and discrimination in reducing the amount of the claims, and this\r\n£1250 was not put upon the whole county, but on certain parts of the\r\ncounty, and the amount at the very least aggravated in a most serious\r\ndegree the weight of taxation that falls upon the ratepayers of the\r\nCounty Kerry, deepening the difficulties that all classes alike must\r\nexperience from the depression of the times, and from the other burdens\r\nthey have to meet in providing against the demands that are made upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n'But, of course, you can easily understand that these things do not at\r\nall give you any idea of other forms of material injury that arise from\r\ncrime and disturbance, in the loss of employment and the discouragement\r\nof capital, the injury to trade, and the multiplied consequences of all\r\nkinds detrimental to the community that arise from insecurity to\r\npersonal property and life. And to all those evils we have to add\r\nanother, and perhaps the worst of all--that of which you are all\r\nconscious, of which experience and observation reaches you every day in\r\nall the forms of social life--a system of unseen terrorism, a system of\r\nterror and tyranny that the well-disposed class of the community ought\r\nto detest and abhor, and in reference to which, on all sides, I have\r\nheard, in this county and other counties, one universal expression of\r\ndesire--that some means should be found to put an end to it.\r\n\r\n'I possess no power myself to effect this state of things, and I cannot\r\nsay that in the relation to the law which you fill as members of the\r\nGrand Jury, or in any other relation to the law, you possess the means\r\nto effect it. The duty of providing against so great an evil existing in\r\nthe community--the duty and the obligation rests with others. My duty is\r\nsimply confined to representing to you the state of things that exists,\r\nand, indeed, in that respect I know that I am doing what is entirely\r\nunnecessary, for the state of the County Kerry now, and for a period of\r\nfive or six years, in all its essential features, is known far beyond\r\nthe limits of the county, to every single person in the country. I will\r\nmerely make use of one general observation--that I by no means share in\r\nthe opinion that has been expressed as to the inability to deal with\r\nthis state of things. On the contrary, I entertain the most perfect\r\nconfidence that it is in the power of those who are intrusted with the\r\nduty of maintaining the public peace to re-establish order and law and\r\npeace in this county. And as my duty is confined to representing that\r\nstate of things, that duty does not carry me to indicate to those on\r\nwhom the responsibility rests the means to attain that object.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE EDENBURN OUTRAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the winter of 1884, so bad did the state of Kerry\r\nbecome, and so menacing was the attitude of the Land Leaguers towards\r\nmyself, that I felt I had no right to endanger the lives of my wife and\r\ndaughters by any longer permitting them to reside at Edenburn.\r\n\r\nIn all those years, from 1878 to 1884, be it noted that I gave more\r\nemployment in Kerry than any one man, a fact which has been testified to\r\nby different parish priests, but at the same time I was agent for a\r\ngreat many landlords, and tried my level best to get in rents for my\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\nFor this cause my life had been repeatedly threatened, and now, in\r\nNovember 1884, dynamite was put to my house, the back of it being badly\r\nblown up. There were sixteen individuals in the house, mostly women and\r\nchildren, and an attempt was therefore made to murder them all in the\r\neffort to take the life of one individual they were afraid to meet in\r\nthe open.\r\n\r\nThe house was repaired and I received compensation in due course from\r\nthe County, but my family did not think after what had occurred that\r\nEdenburn was a desirable place of residence. So I henceforth resided\r\nmuch in London, and therefore spent a great deal less money in Kerry.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, I had better be a little more diffuse about what was\r\nknown all over the British Isles as the Edenburn Outrage, but the bulk\r\nof this chapter will be drawn from observations by members of my family\r\nand newspaper accounts, for the episode left considerably less\r\nimpression on my mind than it did on that of my womenfolk, and indeed on\r\nthe public, at the time.\r\n\r\nTo show how matters stood, one of my daughters reminds me that I gave\r\nher a very neat revolver as a present, and that whenever she came back\r\nfrom school she always slept with it under her pillow. Moreover, she\r\nrecollects that the customary Sunday afternoon pursuit was to have\r\nrevolver practice at the garden gate.\r\n\r\nThere had been several episodes of an ugly nature; for example, one of\r\nmy sons competing in some sports at Tralee was advised to make an excuse\r\nand to go home separately from the womenfolk.\r\n\r\nHe took the hint, and my wife with the governess and several children\r\nwent back without him in the waggonette. About a mile and a half from\r\nthe town, just where the horses had to walk up a steep hill, a number of\r\nmen with bludgeons and sticks came out of a ditch, peered into the trap,\r\nand seeing it contained nothing but women and children let it pass on\r\nwith a grunt of disgust, whilst they trudged back to Tralee.\r\n\r\nOne of my daughters, years after, on being taken in to dinner in London,\r\nwas asked by her companion if she was any relation of mine.\r\n\r\nShe having confessed the fact--one I hope in no way detrimental, though\r\nI say so, perhaps, who should not--he mentioned that he had been to a\r\nmost cheery dance at Edenburn, which had made a great impression on his\r\nmind, because for seven miles along the road by which he and his friends\r\ndrove there were pickets of constabulary, and the hall table was piled\r\nso full with the revolvers brought by the guests, that all the hats and\r\ncoats had to be taken to the smoking-room.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to again mention that my wife during the very worst\r\nperiods had never any difficulty in keeping or obtaining domestic\r\nservants. No doubt the maids liked having two or three stalwart\r\nconstables always hanging about the place, and capital odd job men they\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nA constable neatly humbugged a footman, and I may here mention the\r\nincident, though it is subsequent to the episode of this chapter.\r\n\r\nOne house we took in London was in Glendower Place, and when the\r\nservants arrived, my wife found that the footman's face was covered with\r\nsticking-plaster. He was a regular gossoon, though shaped like a fine\r\nspecimen of the pampered menials who condescend to open the front door\r\nof large mansions to their betters.\r\n\r\nA constable had hoaxed him into believing that he could never walk in\r\nthe London streets without using firearms, and having advised him to\r\nlearn to do so, the idiot put the weapon against his cheek, and the\r\nfirst kick had knocked away a voluminous portion of his countenance.\r\n\r\nAt the end of November 1884, we were packing up to leave, and all the\r\nbig cases were in the stable-yard ready to be carted away. There were\r\nfive policemen at the time in the house, and two of them were on sentry\r\nduty all through the night.\r\n\r\nNone of us had had good nights for some time past, but on the evening of\r\nNovember 29th I came back from the meeting of the Board of Guardians at\r\nListowel, and said to my wife as we sat down to dinner:--\r\n\r\n'After all, we are starting for England to-morrow morning without any\r\nnecessity, for I do believe the country is beginning to settle down.'\r\n\r\nThis is the only occasion on which I ever ventured on a cheerful\r\nprophecy since Ireland came under the baneful spell of Mr. Gladstone,\r\nand it was the most foolish remark I ever made.\r\n\r\nThat night came the explosion, but I prefer to let the press tell the\r\ntale.\r\n\r\nThe _Manchester Guardian_ relates:--\r\n\r\n'The explosive matter was placed under an area in the basement story,\r\ndynamite being the agent employed for the outrage. A large aperture was\r\nmade in the wall, which is three feet thick. Several large rents running\r\nto the top have been made, and it now presents a most dilapidated\r\nappearance. The ground-floor, where the explosion occurred, was used as\r\na larder, and everything in it was smashed to pieces, the glass\r\nwindow-frames and shutters being shivered into atoms. On the three\r\nstories above it, the explosion produced a similar effect. To the right\r\nof it, one of Mr. Hussey's daughters was sleeping, and the window of her\r\nroom was entirely destroyed. Mr. J.E. Hussey, J.P., slept in another\r\nroom about thirty feet from the scene of the explosion, and his window\r\nand room fared similarly. The butler slept in a small room on the\r\nbasement, which was completely wrecked, the windows being shattered to\r\npieces, the lamp and toilet broken, and the greater part of the ceiling\r\nthrown on him in the bed. The length of the house is about fifty yards,\r\nand the windows in the back, numbering twenty-six, have been altogether\r\ndestroyed. Mr. S.M. Hussey and his wife slept in the front, and they\r\nwere much affected by the explosion. Three policemen who had been\r\nstationed in the house for the past couple of years slept on a\r\nground-floor in front. The coach-house and stables near the house were\r\nconsiderably damaged. In the garden two greenhouses, one about 120 yards\r\naway, and the other fully 150, were injured, the greater portion of the\r\nglass being broken and the roofs shaken. In several houses at long\r\ndistances the shock was plainly felt. The dwelling-house subsequently\r\npresented a very wrecked appearance. On looking at the back of it, there\r\nare several rents or cracks to be seen in the solid masonry, and the\r\nslates are shaken and displaced. Everything shows the terrific force of\r\nthe explosion. In the yard a large slate-house was much damaged, the\r\nslates being displaced and the roof shaken and cracked. A large stone\r\nwas found here, having been blown from the dwelling-house.'\r\n\r\nFrom the _Times_ may be culled these additional particulars:\r\n\r\n'There is a fissure some inches wide in the main wall from the ground to\r\nthe roof, and a little more force would have effected the evident object\r\nof making the residence of the obnoxious agent a heap of ruins. The\r\ndamage done is estimated at from £2000 to £3000, but this is only a\r\nrough conjecture.'\r\n\r\nThe _Cork Constitutional_ throws further light in a somewhat badly\r\nexpressed article:--\r\n\r\n'The most extraordinary circumstance connected with the outrage is the\r\nsecrecy and stealth which must have been resorted to in order to avoid\r\ndetection. It was well known in the neighbourhood that not alone were\r\nthree policemen constantly at Edenburn for Mr. Hussey's protection, but\r\nthat a number of dogs were also kept on the premises, and it is,\r\ntherefore, astonishing the care and caution which must have been\r\nresorted to in order to successfully lay and explode the destructive\r\nmaterial. Some idea of the force of the explosion as well as the\r\nstability of the building which resisted it in a measure, may be\r\ngathered from the fact that it was distinctly heard in the town of\r\nCastleisland four miles away. Mr. R. Roche, J.P., who lives a mile from\r\nEdenburn, also distinctly heard the explosion, which he describes as\r\nresembling in sound that caused by the fall of a huge tree in close\r\nproximity. Those who were at Edenburn at the time state that between\r\nfour and half-past four a low rumbling noise, followed by a sharp\r\nreport, was heard. The house trembled and shook to its foundations. The\r\ninmates, some of whom were only awakened by the shock, were seized with\r\nan indescribable terror. All the windows were smashed to atoms, the\r\nfurniture and fixtures in the interior were rattled, and some lighter\r\narticles disturbed from their position. The suddenness of the alarm, and\r\nthe darkness of the night, coupled with an indefinite idea as to the\r\nnature and extent of the explosion, made the occupants of the house\r\nafraid to stir, and it was not until some servants living adjacent\r\narrived that the consternation caused in the household subsided\r\nsufficiently to enable them to examine the house, and judge of the\r\nnarrow escape they had had from a violent and horrible death.'\r\n\r\nThe consternation most decidedly did not spread to the master and\r\nmistress of the establishment. The _Kerry Sentinel_ quickly had an\r\nallusion to 'a report that Mr. Hussey turned into bed after the outrage\r\nwith one of his laconic jokes--that he should be called when the next\r\nexplosion occurred.'\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact what I did say was:-\"My dear, we can have a quiet\r\nnight at last, for the scoundrels won't bother us again before\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I can solemnly testify that within ten minutes of that observation I\r\nwas fast asleep, and never woke till I was called.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the best impression of what occurred can be obtained from\r\nthe recollection of my daughter Florence, now Mrs. Nicoll, who was an\r\ninmate of Edenburn at the time.\r\n\r\n'I was awakened by a terrific noise, which to my sleepy wits conveyed\r\nthe impression that the roof had fallen in. It was then between three\r\nand four in the morning. I lit a candle and ran out into the passage\r\nwhere were congregating my family in night attire. My father was\r\nperfectly calm.\r\n\r\n'\"Dynamite and badly managed,\" was his laconic explanation. We all asked\r\neach other if we were hurt, and began to be alarmed about my brother\r\nJohn, who, however, put in an appearance in a singularly attenuated\r\nnightshirt, with a candle in one hand and a revolver in the other, with\r\nwhich he was rubbing his sleepy eyes.\r\n\r\n'\"Singular time of night, John, to try chemical experiments without our\r\npermission, is it not?\" said my father.\r\n\r\n'Then John and my mother went downstairs to inspect the premises; of the\r\nback windows, thirty-four in number, there was not a bit of glass as big\r\nas a threepenny piece left. Our brougham was in the yard; the window\r\nnext the explosion was intact, but the one on the further side was blown\r\nto smithereens.\r\n\r\n'The servants were very scared, and one maid having rushed straight to a\r\nsitting-room, was there found hysterically embracing a sofa cushion.\r\n\r\n'We received one odd claim for compensation. An old woman living half a\r\nmile off complained that the force of the explosion had knocked some of\r\nthe plaster off the wall, and that it had fallen into a pan full of\r\nmilk, spoiling it.\r\n\r\n'Whilst we were all chattering about the outrage, father said:--\r\n\r\n'\"Don't be uneasy about a mere dynamite explosion; it's like an\r\nIrishman's pig, you want it to go one way and it invariably goes in the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n'And with that he went off to bed again, with the remark about having a\r\nquiet night which he has mentioned earlier in this chapter.\r\n\r\n'The only other thing which I now recall is, that a detachment of the\r\nBuffs in the neighbourhood had found us the only people to entertain\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n'On being told that Edenburn had been blown up, one of them said:--\r\n\r\n'\"They were the only neighbours we had to talk to, and the brutes would\r\nnot leave us them as a convenience.\"'\r\n\r\nThe Cork correspondent of the _Times_ wrote:--\r\n\r\n'Among the general body of the people of Kerry, the news of the attempt\r\nto blow up Mr. Hussey's house at Edenburn caused comparatively little\r\nexcitement. In the County Club at Tralee, the announcement was received\r\nwith something like a panic. Hitherto, persons who considered themselves\r\nin danger were careful to be within their homes before darkness had set\r\nin, and when going abroad had a following of police for their\r\nprotection. Now it is shown that their houses may prove but a sorry\r\nshelter, even when a protective force of police is about, and it is no\r\nwonder that, with the terrible example furnished in this instance of the\r\ndaring of those who commit foul crimes, the class against whom the\r\noutrages are directed should be filled with fears for the future. The\r\npeople generally show but small interest in the occurrence.\r\n\r\n'The attempt to blow up Mr. Hussey's dwelling is the first of its kind\r\nin Kerry, and the third that has been made in Ireland. Within the past\r\nfew years the districts of Castleisland and Tralee have been\r\ndistinguished for the number and ferocity of the outrages that were\r\ncommitted there.'\r\n\r\nI am also tempted to quote from the 'Leader' in the _Times_ on the\r\noutrage:--\r\n\r\n'Mr. Hussey has a reputation, not confined to Ireland, as an able,\r\nfearless, and vigorous land agent, the best type of a much abused class\r\nof men who have endured contumely and faced dangers, by day and night,\r\nin order to protect the rights of property intrusted to them.\r\n\r\n'It appears that, owing to the disturbed state of the locality, he\r\nintended to leave it for the winter; and this probably being known to\r\nhis enemies, they made an effort to destroy him before he got beyond\r\ntheir reach. He, at all events, seems to have been under the spell of no\r\npleasing illusion as to the supposed tranquillity and the reign of\r\norder. On the contrary, he is alleged to have stated that more outrages\r\nthan ever are committed, and that but for the deterrent force employed\r\nby the Government, there would be no living in the country, ... This is\r\nthe opinion of the majority of Englishmen. They are not all satisfied\r\nthat the spirit of lawlessness and disorder is rooted out; and they will\r\nfind only too strong confirmation of their doubts in the reckless\r\nviolence of the National Press, and in the attempt--marked by novel\r\nfeatures of atrocity--to destroy Mr. Hussey's household.'\r\n\r\nAs for the National Press, it indulged in an ecstasy of enthusiasm over\r\nthe perpetration, combined with intense disgust \"at the miscarriage of\r\njustice\" of my having escaped without hurt or more than very temporary\r\ninconvenience. On my departure, one eloquent writer compared me to\r\n'Macduff taking his babes and bandboxes to England,' a choice simile I\r\nhave always appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe _United Ireland_ of December 6, 1884, in a characteristic\r\nleaderette, headed 'A very suspicious affair,' observes:--\r\n\r\n'We should like to know by what right the newspapers speak of the affair\r\nas \"a dynamite outrage\"? A very curious surmise has been put forward\r\nlocally, namely, that the house had been stricken by lightning. The\r\nshattering of a building by lightning is by no means phenomenal, and the\r\nabsence of all trace of any terrestrial explosive agency, gives colour\r\nto the hypothesis that the destruction was due to meteorological\r\ncauses.'\r\n\r\nWith one last quotation I cease to draw upon what may be termed outside\r\ncontributions, and it is one which gratified me at the time.\r\n\r\nIt is taken from the _Cork Examiner_ of December 12, 1884:--\r\n\r\n'Dear Sir,--Authoritative statements having been made in the Press and\r\nelsewhere, that some persons living in Mr. Hussey's immediate\r\nneighbourhood must have been the perpetrators of the horrible outrage,\r\nor, at least, must have given active and guilty assistance to the\r\nprincipal parties concerned in it; now we, the undersigned, tenants on\r\nthe property, and living in the closest proximity to Edenburn House and\r\ndemesne, take this opportunity of declaring in the most public and\r\nsolemn manner that neither directly nor indirectly, by word or deed, by\r\ncounsel or approval, had we any participation in the tragic disaster of\r\nNovember 28. The relations hitherto existing between Mr. Hussey and us\r\nhave ever been of the most friendly character. As a landlord, his\r\ndealings with us were such as gave unqualified satisfaction and were\r\nmarked by justice, impartiality, and very great indulgence. As a\r\nneighbour he was extremely kind and obliging, ready whenever applied to,\r\nto help us, as far as he was able, in every difficulty or trial in which\r\nwe might be placed. The bare suspicion, therefore, of being ever so\r\nremotely connected with the recent explosion, is, to us, a source of the\r\ndeepest pain, a suspicion we repudiate with honest indignation.\r\nFurthermore, the singular charity, benevolence, and amiability of Mrs.\r\nHussey are long and intimately known to us. We witness almost daily her\r\nbountiful treatment of the poor, and tender care of the sick and infirm.\r\nHer ears never refuse to listen with sympathy to every tale of distress,\r\nnor will she hesitate with her own hands to wash and dress the festering\r\nwounds and sores of those who flock to her from all the surrounding\r\nparishes. With such knowledge as this, we should indeed be worse than\r\nfiends did we raise a hand against the Hussey family, or engage in any\r\nenterprise that would necessitate their departure from among us:--\r\n\r\n  'Richard Fitzgerald.\r\n   Denis Daly.\r\n   John Reynolds.\r\n   Cornelius Daly.\r\n   William Hogan.\r\n   Darby Leary.\r\n   John Mason.\r\n   Jeremiah Dinan.\r\n   J. O'connell.\r\n   John Neligan.\r\n   Daniel Neill.\r\n   John Daly.\r\n   Thomas Connor.\r\n   Jeremiah Connor.\r\n   Thomas Shanahen.\r\n   Michael Moynihar.\r\n   Widow Aherne.\r\n   James O'sullivan.\r\n   John M'elligott.\r\n   Henry Gentleman.'\r\n\r\nAs for those really concerned, people tell me that the three implicated\r\nin the dynamite business are all dead in America, and if the information\r\nis accurate no local person was connected with the explosion, though the\r\nmiscreants were, of course, housed in the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nThere was one delicious incident.\r\n\r\nThe local branch of the Land League at Castleisland refused to pay any\r\nreward to the dynamiters because we had not been killed, and the leading\r\nmiscreant actually fired at the treasurer. Eventually the passages to\r\nAmerica of all the triumvirate were paid, and they thought it discreet\r\nto quit the country, cursing their own stingy executive even more deeply\r\nthan they blasphemed against the Law and execrated me.\r\n\r\nA man from the neighbourhood subsequently wrote to me from London that\r\nhe could tell me who perpetrated the Edenburn outrage.\r\n\r\nI told him to call on me at the Union Club, of which I was then a\r\nmember, and informed him--his name was O'Brien--I would arrange with the\r\nHome Office, in the event of his information being valuable, that he\r\nshould get a reward.\r\n\r\nHe replied that his life was in danger in London from another Fenian.\r\n\r\nI went to the Home Office and saw Mr. Jenkinson on the subject. He asked\r\nme to send O'Brien down to him and he would settle matters, adding that\r\nhe had reason for believing that the story of threats from another\r\nscoundrel was true.\r\n\r\nI saw O'Brien and told him to call on Mr. Jenkinson.\r\n\r\nHe answered that he would go, but he never did, and Mr. Jenkinson\r\nsubsequently told me that the Land League scented he was going to prove\r\na troublesome informer, so they practically outbid the Government by\r\npaying O'Brien a large sum, which was handed to him on the steamer as it\r\nwas starting for America.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, until I have been recalling the incidents of the\r\nexplosion for this book, I have never given a thought to the affair and\r\nnot mentioned it half a dozen times in the twenty years that have\r\nelapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nMORE ATROCITIES AND LAND CRIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nI brought my family back to Kerry in the following summer, and after I\r\nhad rebuilt Edenburn I lived there until I gave it to my elder son, who\r\nhas it to this day and resides there in peace.\r\n\r\nMatters were very different to that state of idyllic simplicity in the\r\ncritical times on which I am still dwelling.\r\n\r\nOne night, while in London, I was at the House of Commons, and the\r\nLondon correspondent of the _Freeman_, being presumably extremely short\r\nof what he would term 'copy,' he proceeded to make observations about me\r\nafter this fashion:--\r\n\r\n'Over here Mr. Hussey is something of a fish out of water. It would be\r\nhazardous to say that if he was to begin his career as an agent again he\r\nwould eschew the system that has made him famous, but his present frame\r\nof mind is unquestionably one of doubt as to whether, after all, the\r\ngame was worth the candle.'\r\n\r\nThat young man will go far as a writer of fiction.\r\n\r\nI received, among more pleasant welcomes on my return to my native land,\r\nthe following delightful blast of vituperation from the _Irish Citizen_,\r\nand beg to tender the unknown author my profound thanks for the\r\ndiversion his ink-slinging afforded me:--\r\n\r\n'Here is something about a man who ought to have been murdered any day\r\nsince 1879--indeed we don't know that he should have been let live even\r\nup to that date, and as for his family, their translation to the upper\r\nregions by means of a simple charge of dynamite, which nobody of any\r\nsense or importance would even think of condemning, has been most\r\nunaccountably deferred to the present year. This man is Mr. S.M. Hussey,\r\nthe miasma of whose breath, according to a well-informed murder organ in\r\nDublin, poisons one-half of the kingdom of Kerry. Let any man read the\r\nspeeches delivered in Upper Sackville Street, and the articles in\r\n_United Ireland_ against Mr. Hussey, and he must ask why the fiend\r\nincarnate has not been murdered long since. The infamy of persistently\r\nturning hatred on a man like Mr. Hussey, and then escaping the\r\nconsequences of having thereby murdered him, has no parallel in any\r\ncountry in the world. Inciting to murder is practically reduced to a\r\nscience in Ireland. That Mr. Hussey has not been murdered years ago is\r\nnot the fault of the scientist, but the watchfulness of the police.'\r\n\r\nMy experience while in England had been that few people I met really\r\nappreciated what boycotting was like, so how are my readers of twenty\r\nyears afterwards to do so? Yet when I went back to Ireland, it seemed to\r\nme even more cruel than when I had grown comparatively accustomed by\r\nsheer proximity to it.\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell had himself given the order in a public speech:--\r\n\r\n'Shun the man who bids for a farm from which a tenant has been evicted,\r\nshun him in the street, in the shop, in the marketplace, even in the\r\nplace of worship, as if he were a leper of old.'\r\n\r\nThis was done with the thoroughness which characterises Irishmen when\r\nback-sliding into unimaginable cruelties. Should a boycotted man enter\r\nchapel, the whole congregation rose as with one accord and left him\r\nalone in the building. Considering the sensitive and pious disposition\r\nof the average Irishman, such ostracism was even more poignant than it\r\nwould be to an Englishman.\r\n\r\nOnly two families in Kerry, possibly in Munster, at Christmas 1885, had\r\nthe courage to resist the National League police, commonly called\r\nmoonlighters. These two were the Curtins and the Doyles. The Curtins had\r\nto be under constant police protection, were insulted wherever they\r\nwent, and their murdered father was openly called 'the murderer.' As for\r\nthe Doyles, the Board of Guardians was urged to harass his unfortunate\r\nchildren, who were both deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nThe same Board of Guardians was most lavish in its relief to any man\r\nevicted for declining to pay his rent. In one case they gave a man\r\nfifteen shillings a week--or treble the ordinary out-of-door relief--for\r\nover six years.\r\n\r\nSir James Stephen, a man of acute discriminations, who has done more\r\njustice to the Irish problem than any one else, wrote:--\r\n\r\n'The great difficulty the Land League and the National League have had\r\nto contend with is that of hindering the neighbouring farmers, peasants,\r\nand labourers from frustrating the strike against rent by taking up\r\nvacant farms, however they came to be vacant. Boycotting never succeeded\r\nunless crime was at its back. The Crimes Act cut the ground from under\r\nthe feet of the boycotters, not so much by its direct prohibitions of\r\nthe practice as by making it unsafe to commit outrages in enforcing the\r\nlaw of the League. The Land League and the National League were nothing\r\nelse but screens for secret societies whose work was to enforce the\r\nLeague decrees by outrage and murder.'\r\n\r\nWhenever the 'History of Modern Ireland' comes to be written, that\r\nglowing outburst of truth ought to be quoted.\r\n\r\nThere were some evictions carried out at Farranfore on the estate of\r\nLord Kenmare, by the sub-sheriff, Mr. Harnett, and a force of military\r\nand police numbering about one hundred and thirty.\r\n\r\nDuring the eviction of one Daly, horns were blown and the chapel bell\r\nset ringing. These appeals drew about three thousand people to the\r\nplace, who groaned and threw some stones, besides growing so menacing\r\nthat the Riot Act had to be read, upon which the whole crowd moved off.\r\n\r\nThis brought a characteristic effusion from _United Ireland_:--\r\n\r\n'We remember the time when Kerry was a county as quiet as the grave,\r\nwhen its member, Henry A. Herbert, in the debate on the Westminster Act\r\nof 1871, was able to rise in his place and boast that in purely Celtic\r\ncounties like his there was no crime, and that agrarian outrages was\r\nconfined to districts infused with English blood, like Meath and\r\nTipperary. What has changed it? Principally the malpractices of a couple\r\nof agents ruling over half its area, whose bloated rentals grow swollen\r\nunder their hands with the sweat of dumb and hopeless possessors.'\r\n\r\nWhatever else he possessed, that writer had not one vestige of truth\r\nwith which to cover the indecency of his misrepresentations.\r\n\r\nHe did not mention that Mr. Matthew Harris, a Member for Galway, had\r\npublicly observed that if the tenant farmers of Ireland shot down\r\nlandlords as partridges are shot in the month of September, he would\r\nnever say a word against them.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that the convulsion of horror at the murder of Lord\r\nFrederick Cavendish alone prevented an organised campaign for the\r\n'removal' of Irish landlords on a systematic and wholesale scale.\r\n\r\nBy the way, according to his son, it was quite by chance that Professor\r\nMahaffy--that illustrious ornament of Trinity College--was not also\r\nmurdered. He had intended to walk over with poor Mr. Burke after the\r\nentry of the Viceroy and Chief Secretary, but he was detained by an\r\nundergraduate and so found it too late to catch the doomed victim before\r\nhe started. Had he walked with them, it is questionable if the murderers\r\nwould have attacked three men: on the other hand, he might, of course,\r\nhave been added to the slain.\r\n\r\nThere was a meeting of Lord Kenmare's and Mr. Herbert of Muckross's\r\ntenants at Killarney addressed by Mr. Sheehan, M.P., who advised them,\r\nas the landlords refused 70 per cent, only to offer 50 per cent., and\r\nnothing at all in March (1887), as by that time the new Irish Parliament\r\nwould have allotted the land free to the present holders, without any\r\ncompensation to the landlords.\r\n\r\nDespite the efforts of traitors on both sides of the Channel, that Irish\r\nParliament has not yet been summoned.\r\n\r\nThe parish priest, Mr. Sheehy, stopped the Limerick hunting, and so took\r\n£24,000 a year out of the pockets of the very poor. That man did more\r\nharm than the landlords, who alone gave the poor work, and there is no\r\ndoubt that many of the worst crimes were instigated and indirectly\r\nsuggested from the altar.\r\n\r\nAt this point I want to interpose with one word to the reader to beg him\r\nnot to regard this as either a connected narrative of crime, much less a\r\nregular essay with proper deductions--the trimmings to the joint--but\r\nonly a series of observations as I recall events which impressed me, and\r\nwhich I think may come home with some force to a happier generation that\r\nknew neither Parnellism nor crime. To write a consecutive and connected\r\nhistory of these atrocities would be to compile a volume of horrors. I\r\nprefer to give a few recollections of outrages, and to let the direct\r\nsimplicity of these terrible reminiscences impress those who have bowels\r\nof compassion.\r\n\r\nA gentleman named Nield was killed in Mayo, simply because he was\r\nmistaken for my son Maurice. This was in broad daylight, in the town of\r\nCharlestown. It was raining hard at the time--a thing so common in\r\nIreland that no one mentions it any more than they do the fact of the\r\ndaily paper appearing each morning--and the unfortunate victim had an\r\numbrella up, so the mob could not see his face. They shouted, 'Here's\r\nHussey,' and tried to pull him off the car, but the parish priest\r\nstopped this. However, before he could reduce the villains to the fear\r\nof the Church, which does affect them more than the fear of the Law,\r\nthey gave poor Nield a blow on the head, and, though he lived for six\r\nmonths, he never recovered.\r\n\r\nAnother time, when returning to his house in Mayo from Ballyhaunis, on a\r\ndark night, my son Maurice found a wall built, about eighteen inches\r\nhigh, across the road, for the express purpose of upsetting him. It was\r\nonly by the grace of God--as they say in Kerry--and his own careful\r\ndriving, that he was preserved.\r\n\r\nIn those same Land League times, my son was a prominent gentleman rider.\r\nAt Abbeyfeale races he rode in a green jacket and won the race, which\r\nproduced a lot of enthusiasm, the crowd not knowing who it was sporting\r\nthe popular colour. They only heard it was my son after he had left the\r\ncourse, whereupon a mob rushed to the station, and the police had to\r\nstand four deep outside the carriage window to protect him, to say\r\nnothing of an extra guard at the station gates.\r\n\r\nThe cordiality of my fellow-countrymen also provided me with another\r\ndisturbed night at Aghadoe, which I had leased from Lord Headley.\r\n\r\nTo quiet the apprehensions of my family, and also to relieve the mind of\r\nthe D.I. from anxiety about my tough old self, there were always five\r\npolice in the house, and two on sentry duty all night.\r\n\r\nOn this particular date, about two o'clock in the morning, we were\r\naroused by hearing shots fired in the wood below the house, the plan of\r\nthe miscreants being to draw the police away from the house. As this did\r\nnot succeed, a second party began a counter demonstration in another\r\nquarter. The theory is that a third party wanted to approach the house\r\nfrom the back in the temporary absence of the constabulary, and\r\ndisseminate the house, its contents, and the inhabitants into the air\r\nand the immediate vicinity by the gentle and persuasive influence of\r\ndynamite.\r\n\r\nHowever, the police were not to be tricked, and soon the fellows, having\r\ngrown apprehensive, or having exhausted all their ammunition, were heard\r\ndriving _off_. Signs of blood were found on the road towards Beaufort\r\nnext morning, so the attacking force suffered some inconvenience in\r\nreturn for giving us a bad night.\r\n\r\nLord Morris, among a group of acquaintances in Dublin, pointing to me,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n'That's the Jack Snipe who provided winter shooting for the whole of\r\nKerry, and not one of them could wing him.'\r\n\r\n'Mighty poor sport they got out of it,' I answered, 'and I have an even\r\nworse opinion of their capacity for accurate aiming than I have of their\r\nbenevolent intentions.'\r\n\r\nOther people know more of oneself than one does, and I was much\r\ninterested to hear that, in this year of grace, the editor of the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ said of me:--\r\n\r\n'Sam Hussey, yes, that's the famous Irishman they used to call\r\n\"Woodcock\" Hussey, because he was never hit, though often shot at.'\r\n\r\nI always thought 'Woodcock' Carden had the monopoly of the epithet, but\r\nam proud to find I infringed his patent.\r\n\r\nI was benevolently commended by a vituperative ink-slinger, Daniel\r\nO'Shea, in his letter to the _Sunday Democrat_ in 1886, but none of\r\nthose he blackguarded were in the least inconvenienced by 'the roll of\r\nhis tongue,' as the saying is:--\r\n\r\n'A vast number of the Irish have been heartlessly persecuted by the most\r\ndespotic landlords of Ireland, such as Lord Kenmare, Herbert, Headley,\r\nHussey, Winn, and the Marquis of Lansdowne, all of whom are Englishmen\r\nby birth, and consequently aliens in heart, despots by instinct,\r\nabsentees by inclination, and always in direct opposition to the cause\r\nof Ireland. Poor-rate, town-rate, income-tax, are nothing less than\r\nwholesale robbery, and is it any wonder that some of the people who are\r\nthus oppressed should be driven to desperation? It is deplorable to\r\nlearn that they should have had any cause to commit what are called\r\n\"agrarian\" crimes. Why not turn their attention to these landlords, the\r\npolice, the travelling coercion magistrates, not forgetting the\r\nemergency men? These are the people to whom I would direct the attention\r\nof the men of Kerry.'\r\n\r\nI have given a number of examples of how I have been genially\r\nappreciated in the hostile Press, but my family are of opinion that it\r\nwould not be fair, considering how many kind things were published in\r\nloyal journals, not to render some tribute to them too. I was sincerely\r\nobliged when I received a good word, but, frankly, the bad ones amused\r\nme much more. However, I am not ungrateful, and I have specially prized\r\none able description of my attitude which appeared in the _Globe_, the\r\nmanly strain of the writing of which is in healthy contrast to the\r\nhysterical effusions tainted with adjectival mania of those who wanted\r\nme shot, but were too cowardly to fire at me themselves:--\r\n\r\n'Mr. Hussey is admittedly fair and just in his dealings with his own\r\ntenants. But he is only just and fair, which, in the ethics of Irish\r\nagrarianism, is equivalent to being a rack-renter and a tyrant. He\r\nrefuses to let his own land at whatever the tenants think well to pay\r\nfor it. He persists, with exasperating obstinacy, in refusing to\r\nsacrifice the interests of the landlords for whom he acts. In short, Mr.\r\nHussey is one of the most determined and formidable obstacles to the\r\nsuccess of the Land League. While such men have the courage to face the\r\nagrarian conspiracy, that grand consummation of patriotic effort--the\r\nrooting out of landlordism--must be a somewhat tough and tedious\r\nbusiness. He has lived in the midst of enemies, who would have murdered\r\nhim if only they had the opportunity. His life, it may be safely said,\r\nhas had no stronger security than his own ability to protect it.'\r\n\r\nAnd yet some one ventured to call Irish land agents 'popularity-hunting\r\nscoundrels.'\r\n\r\n'Popularity and getting in money were never on the same bush,' as I told\r\nLord Kenmare, and if I had stopped to think how I should make myself\r\npopular, I should have bothered my head about what I did not care\r\ntwopence for, and provided an even more easy target for firing at at\r\nshort range.\r\n\r\nDrifting from a man who paid no heed to scoundrels, I am led to allude\r\nto the attitude of a profession, the members of which profited by their\r\namenities--I, of course, mean solicitors--because some one put a\r\nquestion to me on the subject only the other day.\r\n\r\nMy answer is, that none of the solicitors were in the Land League, and\r\nthey did not instigate outrages; but they drew comfortable fees for\r\ndefending the perpetrators.\r\n\r\nSwindlers and murderers never agree, for they practise distinct\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\nWe were fighting a Land War, and though I have kept back land questions\r\nas much as I can, in order not to weary the reader with what never\r\nwearies me, I have one or two examples to give which cannot be omitted\r\nif I am to portray the true facts.\r\n\r\nMy firm was agent for an estate in Castleisland, the rent of which, in\r\n1841, was £2300. I exhibited the rental, showing only three quarters in\r\narrear. By 1886 it was cut down by the Commissioners to £ 1800, and the\r\nlandlord sold it for £30,000, for which the tenants used to pay four per\r\ncent, for forty-nine years, to cover principal and interest.\r\n\r\nThere was a tenant on that estate named Dennis Coffey. He took a farm at\r\n£105 a year; the Commissioners reduced that rent to £80. He purchased it\r\nfor £1440--eighteen years' purchase, for which his son has £42 a year\r\nfor forty-nine years. The father had purchased a farm for fee-simple of\r\nequal value for £3000, which he left to two others of his sons. So that\r\none son, by paying half what he had covenanted to pay, and which he\r\ncould pay, gets a farm equal in value to what his father paid £3000 in\r\nhard cash for. The man who is paying rent has his farm well stocked; the\r\nothers are paupers, and one died in the poorhouse.\r\n\r\nThat may belong to to-day, and not to the period of outrage with which I\r\nhave been dealing; but it duly points the moral, and is the outcome of\r\nthose times.\r\n\r\nAt the Boyle Board of Guardians in 1887, upon a discussion over the\r\nKilronan threatened evictions, Mr. Stuart said:--\r\n\r\n'There was one of these men arrested by the police. His rent was £4,\r\n12s. 6d., and, when arrested, a deposit-receipt for £220 was found in\r\nhis pocket.'\r\n\r\nThis case had been freely cited at home and in America as a typical\r\ninstance of the ruthless tyranny of Irish landlords.\r\n\r\nMy friend and neighbour, Mr. Arthur Blennerhassett, addressed the\r\nfollowing letter to Mr. W.E. Gladstone, then Prime Minister:--\r\n\r\n'Sir--I beg respectfully to call your attention to the following\r\nstatement. In 1866, Judge Longfield conveyed to my uncle, under what was\r\ncalled an indefeasible title, the lands of Inch East, Ardroe and Inch\r\nIsland, and previous to the sale, Judge Longfield caused them to be\r\nvalued by Messrs. Gadstone and Ellis, and in the face of the rental, he\r\ncertified that the fair letting value of Inch East and Ardroe was £230,\r\nand that the fair letting value of Inch Island was £75, now in hand. On\r\nthe strength of will, my uncle purchased the lands valued at £305 for\r\n£6200, and your sub-Commissioners have just reduced the rental of Inch\r\nEast and Ardroe at the rate of from £230 to £170 a year.\r\n\r\nI therefore request you will be pleased to take some steps to recoup me\r\nfor the £60 a year I have lost by the action of the Government, and I\r\nmay say this can be partially done by abandoning the quit rent and tithe\r\nrent charge, amounting to £34, 5s. 4d., which I am now forced by the\r\nGovernment to pay without any reduction.\r\n\r\nA. BLENNERHASSETT.'\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable W.E. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oracle of Hawarden was as dumb to this as to my effusion to a\r\nsimilar purport already mentioned. Not even the proverbial postcard was\r\nsent to Tralee, so the verbosity of Mr. Gladstone was strangely checked\r\nwhen he found himself pinned down to facts by Irish landlords.\r\n\r\nWhilst landlords and their families were literally starving, and agents\r\nwere collecting what they could at the peril of their lives, the real\r\nland-grabbers, the no-renters, were accumulating money, and investing it\r\nin land.\r\n\r\nI sent the following series of sales to the _Times_ to show the real\r\nvalue of land:--\r\n\r\n  (1) The interest on Lord Granard's estate, the valuation of which was\r\n  five guineas, was sold for £280, and the fee-simple subsequently\r\n  bought for £80.\r\n\r\n  (2) On one of his own farms for which the tenant paid £65 annual rent,\r\n  the tenant's interest fetched £750 and auction fees.\r\n\r\n  (3) A farm at Curraghila, near Tralee, annual rent £70, Poor Law\r\n  valuation, £51, 10s., area stat. 73 acres. The tenant's interest was\r\n  sold for £700.\r\n\r\n  (4) Tenant's interest on a farm in County Tipperary, on Lord\r\n  Normanton's estate, at yearly rent of £30, was sold for £600, and the\r\n  fee-simple purchased for £450.\r\n\r\n  (5) Tenant's interest at Breaing, near Castleisland, held at the\r\n  annual rent of £51, 10s., was sold for £550.\r\n\r\n  (6) At Abbeyfeale, County Kerry, tenant of a small farm, at annual\r\n  rent of twenty-four shillings, sold his interest for £55.\r\n\r\nAll the sales, save the Tipperary one, were in a district in which,\r\nprior to the Land Act of 1881, tenant-right was unknown.\r\n\r\nPoetry is always congenial to an Irishman, probably because it has\r\nlicences almost as great as he likes to take, and has a vague,\r\nirresponsible way of putting things, much akin to his own methods.\r\n\r\nHere are some lines from the 'Irish Tenant's Song' which express a good\r\ndeal of the popular emotion:--\r\n\r\n  Oh, Parnell, dear, and did you hear the news that's going round?\r\n  The landlords are forbid by law to live on Irish ground.\r\n  No more their rent-days they may keep, nor agents harsh distrain,\r\n  The widow need no longer weep, for over is their reign.\r\n  I met with mighty Gladstone, and he took me by the hand,\r\n  And he said, 'Hurrah for Ireland! 'tis now the happy land.\r\n  'Tis a most delightful country that I for you have made--You\r\n  may shoot the landlord through the head who asks that rent be paid.'\r\n  We care not for the agent, nor do we care for those\r\n  Who come upon us to distrain--we pay them back in blows.\r\n  And when hopeless, helpless, ruined, these landlords vile shall roam,\r\n  We'll hunt and hound them from the roofs they've held so long as home.\r\n\r\nI don't say that was sung in Castleisland, but it might have been the\r\nlocal hymn and verbal companion to the brutal misdeeds of the benighted\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nAs if matters were not bad enough, that Apostle of outrage Mr. Michael\r\nDavitt came to Castleisland on February 21, 1886, and in a pestilential\r\nspeech, inciting to crime, he showed that, at all events, he appreciated\r\nthat for sheer blackness and turpitude Kerry was bad to beat. He said:--\r\n\r\n'For some time past Kerry has attracted more attention for the\r\noccurrences which have been taking place here, than the whole remainder\r\nof Ireland put together. I am not without hope that henceforth, until\r\nthe battle with landlordism and Dublin Castle is triumphantly over, the\r\npeople of Kerry will be towers of strength to the national cause. The\r\nhope of Irish landlordism is now centred in Kerry. Elsewhere it has\r\nnone, it is a social rinderpest, since the National League was started\r\n1600 families have been turned out in this one county.'\r\n\r\nCaptain M'Calmont in the House of Commons, three weeks afterwards,\r\ncalled attention to Mr. Baron Dowse's address to the Grand Jury of the\r\nCounty of Kerry in which he stated:--\r\n\r\n'That this county is in a very much worse state than it has been for\r\nyears: that there are no less than three hundred offences specially\r\nreported to the constabulary since the Assizes of 1885, consisting of\r\ntwo cases of murder, eighteen cases of letters threatening to murder,\r\nthirty-nine cases of cattle, horse, and sheep stealing, eleven cases of\r\narson, eighteen cases of maiming cattle, fifty-two cases of seizing\r\narms, seventy-four cases of sending threatening letters, and twenty-four\r\ncases of intimidation.'\r\n\r\nYou will observe that this is the same picture from two different points\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nAlmost the worst case in which I was personally interested, was that of\r\nthe Cruickshank family.\r\n\r\nThe father, an industrious, respectable, elderly Scotsman, supported his\r\nfamily at Inch by the proceeds of a rabbit-warren which he rented. He\r\nhad no farm, and therefore might expect to live in peace, even in Kerry,\r\nin those times; but, as he was a Scotch Protestant, and had arms, he was\r\na marked man.\r\n\r\nHaving been threatened, he was partially guarded by the police who\r\npatrolled the district. However, in April 1885, when the Prince of Wales\r\nvisited Ireland, and the constabulary from country districts were\r\ndrafted into the towns through which he had to pass, a number of\r\ndisguised Nationalists entered Cruickshank's house at night. They gave\r\nhim a frightful beating, even breaking a gun on his head, which was\r\nseriously injured. This was done in the presence of his wife and\r\ndaughters, and of a young son who, with one of his sisters, went off in\r\nthe night to a police station four miles distant, to obtain assistance\r\nfor his father.\r\n\r\nBetween the fight and the chill received that night, the boy fell into a\r\ndecline of which he died in May 1886. One daughter, not strong at the\r\ntime of the outrage, became a chronic invalid. The father, as soon as he\r\nwas able to move after the perpetration, applied for compensation under\r\nthe Crimes Act, but as it was then to expire in about a fortnight, the\r\nLord-Lieutenant refused to consider the case. The poor fellow continued\r\nto suffer from the wounds on his head, and so affected was he by the\r\nshock of his son's death, that he became insensible and only survived\r\nhim a few weeks, leaving his widow and three daughters without any means\r\nof support.\r\n\r\nMy wife and the former Archdeacon of Ardfert appealed for subscriptions\r\nand obtained £120, which enabled the unfortunate survivors to return to\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThat was the settlement of the land question that suited the\r\nNationalists, namely, to cause the death of the head of the family, and\r\nto get the rest out of the country. It did not say much for the\r\ncivilisation of the nineteenth century, but after the brutalities of the\r\nspring of 1871 in Paris, there can be no doubt how thin is the veneer\r\nover the barbarity of even the most civilised; those deeds were\r\nperpetrated in the heart of the European capital specially devoted to\r\namusement: what I describe took place in the most distant portion of\r\nEurope, where Nature is lovely and man, alas, the creature of impulse,\r\nthe prey of those who lead him into the worst temptations.\r\n\r\nAnother settlement was suggested by an anonymous writer who concealed\r\nhis identity under the pseudonym of Saxon. He observed:--\r\n\r\n'Two hundred millions of English money are now (1886) to be spent buying\r\nout Irish landlords, but would it not be surely better and more in\r\naccordance with reason and justice to buy out the tenants? At a very low\r\ncalculation, two hundred millions would put a couple of hundred pounds\r\nin every Irishman's pocket, and there is not one of them that would\r\nrefuse to leave his beloved country, and bless America or Australia on\r\nthese terms. The island could be populated with Scotch and English\r\nsettlers, and our difficulties be at an end. The Irish must not have\r\ntheir own loaf and ours too. I commend this scheme to Messrs. Gladstone\r\nand Morley. It is quite as just, quite as reasonable, and more forcible\r\nthan their own.'\r\n\r\nHear, hear! say I, but our grandchildren's grandchildren when grey old\r\nmen will still be trying to settle the Irish question, which can never\r\nbe settled until there arises a big man strong enough to force his will\r\non the Empire and fortunate enough to be able to hand over the reins of\r\npolitical dictatorship to an equally enlightened and powerful successor.\r\n\r\nIt is hopeless to expect Irish matters to go well, when the balance of\r\nparties in the House of Commons is held by hirelings and traitors, men\r\nwho debase patriotism and would to-day encourage outrage as much as they\r\ndid in 1884, if it was worth their mercenary while.\r\n\r\nI had a word to write myself a year later to Mr. T. Harrington, who\r\nthought he could tell as many lies about me as suited his own purpose,\r\nand I addressed my reply, published on August 29, 1887, to the Editor of\r\nthe _Times_. It ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n'Sir--I have just read the speech of Mr. T. Harrington in the debate on\r\nMr. Gladstone's motive relating to the proclamation of the National\r\nLeague, in which he states that I invented and gave to Mr. Balfour the\r\nparticulars of the boycotting of Justin M'Carthy. I beg you will allow\r\nme to state that I never wrote to Mr. Balfour, or to any member of the\r\nGovernment, on that or any subject. Had I supplied the information, I\r\nwould have mentioned some facts which Mr. Balfour omitted, for instance,\r\nthat a man named Andrew Griffin was nearly murdered because he brought\r\nprovisions to Justin M'Carthy, that four men were put on their trial for\r\nthe outrage, but notwithstanding a plain charge from the judge, the\r\njury, fearing the vengeance of the League, acquitted the prisoners. I\r\nwould also mention a fact that would seem almost incredible to your\r\nEnglish Catholic readers, that the old man cannot attend his place of\r\nworship without being hissed at in the church, and that his aged wife,\r\nwhile partaking of the sacrament of the Holy Communion, was hissed at\r\nand jeered. These things can be proved on oath, and are not to be set\r\naside by frothy declamation. Neither can the fact be disproved that one\r\nof the offences for which Justin M'Carthy has suffered was that he\r\npurchased his farm from me under Lord Ashbourne's Act, a proceeding\r\nwhich (as it is likely to settle down the country) is considered a\r\ndeadly crime; and for committing the same offence another man in the\r\nsame barony had his cows stabbed.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant, S.M. HUSSEY.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is yet another case I cannot forbear from handing on to a\r\ngeneration that knows no outrages nearer home than Macedonia. Six\r\nruffians, having their faces covered with handkerchiefs, and armed with\r\nheavy cudgels, entered the house of a farmer named Lambe and began to\r\nbeat him. To save his head from the blows, he ran the upper part of his\r\nbody up the chimney and held on by the cross-bar. His wife, on coming to\r\nhis assistance, was beaten so severely that her skull was fractured,\r\nwhile an aged female--stated to be in her ninety-seventh year--was not\r\nonly roughly handled, but also beaten. A most discreditable episode\r\nindeed, in a land formerly renowned for respect for womanhood, and for\r\nthe warm-hearted generosity of her sons.\r\n\r\nIn only one instance in Kerry was police protection being regarded as\r\nnecessary up to the present summer, and all who know the contemporary\r\ncondition of affairs will at once recollect that Mrs. Morrogh Bernard is\r\nthe lady in question.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Edward Morrogh Bernard of Fahagh Court, Bullybrack, was a\r\nRoman Catholic, who had resided in Kerry all his life, and some\r\nfive-and-twenty years ago he built on his property the residence in\r\nwhich he died in the spring of 1904. He and his wife, an English lady,\r\nwho was justly beloved for her wide charity, were one night, after\r\ndinner, sitting in their drawing-room, when a party of masked\r\nmoonlighters walked in. One of them held a pistol to her head, and told\r\nher not to scream or move, else he would shoot her. Another performed\r\nthe same kindly office for Mr. Bernard, whilst the rest ransacked the\r\nhouse for arms and money.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bernard noticed that the hands of the man who was threatening her\r\nwith violence were not those of an agricultural labourer, because they\r\nwere small and white. On the strength of this clue, the police arrested\r\na little tailor in the village, and she courageously identified him in\r\ncourt, though every possible pressure was brought on her not to do so.\r\nHe was sentenced to several years' imprisonment, and his friends vowed\r\nthey would make it hot for Mrs. Bernard, and ever after she has been\r\nprotected by two or three constables. The police did not live in Fahagh\r\nCourt, but in a hut specially built for them a few yards off, and at\r\nnight they always came into the house. To the very last days of Mr.\r\nBernard's life whenever he and she went to pay a call on a neighbour,\r\ntwo policemen followed them either on a car or on bicycles, and I have\r\nnever heard any reasons advanced to show that these precautions were\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nMeeting this little party on the highway was the only thing in the\r\ntwentieth century which brought home to the British tourist the terrible\r\ndeeds which blackened Kerry in the eighties.\r\n\r\nI have always looked on the light side of life, even when it has seemed\r\nblackest, and so I will not close this chapter without a more cheery\r\nanecdote.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of friction among Land Leaguers over the amount of\r\nrelief money and other remuneration doled out by the rebel authorities.\r\nThis seldom reached a more droll pitch than in the complaint of a girl\r\nat Rossbeigh, who wrote to a prominent member of Parliament--since\r\ndeceased--that another girl had been awarded a pound for booing at a\r\nsergeant, 'while I, who broke a policeman's head, never got so much as\r\nwould pay for a candle to the Blessed Virgin.'\r\n\r\nSometimes the crafty Paddy utilised the agitation for his own purposes,\r\nas the following example will prove.\r\n\r\nA farmer's house was fired into, but no one could tell the reason why,\r\nfor he had not paid any rent and was a good Land Leaguer. He was asked\r\nif he could account for it himself, and after some shuffling under\r\npromise of strict secrecy, made the following revelation.\r\n\r\n'Well, it was this way, I married a dacent girl from the North, and all\r\nwent well with us until her mother came along, and she had the divil's\r\nown tongue, and nothing could get her out of the house. I would say \"the\r\nNorth has fine air, would not a change back there get you your health?\"\r\n\r\n'To which the old Biddy would reply:--\r\n\r\n'\"Where would I live except with my only daughter and her husband?\"\r\n\r\n'And this sort of thing made me desperate, and I promised the \"bhoys\"\r\nfive shillings if they would fire round the house on a certain night. On\r\nthe evening that had been agreed upon, I began reading on the paper how\r\nfarms in Castleisland were being fired into, and the old woman said that\r\nif these things were so, County Kerry was worse than County Cork, and I\r\nthought to myself \"maybe you'll find it so, you ould divil.\"\r\n\r\n'Well, they came and did their work in grand style after we had gone to\r\nbed, and there was the mother-in-law screeching and bawling, and every\r\nhour too long for her until daylight, when I put her in the cart and\r\ndrove her to the station.'\r\n\r\nThe sequel is that the couple left to themselves lived happily ever\r\nafter, a thing more likely to happen to people in England and Ireland,\r\nif it was no one's business to make bad blood between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have probably given evidence to as many Commissions as any living man,\r\nfor I have been before seven, and never once was asked a question that\r\nposed me.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the experience of being asked about what I knew by those who\r\nknew nothing on the subject, and if the legal mind was a little more\r\nobtuse than the civil, well, it was only the choice between a grey\r\ndonkey and a black.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Commission I gave evidence before was one on Agriculture.\r\nProfessor Bohnamy Price was one of the Commissioners, and he knew what\r\nhe was talking about, others being Lord Carlingford, the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch, and the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who presided. The peers\r\nwere all used to big parks, obsequious bailiffs, and huge demesnes. I\r\nthink they metaphorically picked up their coat tails and stepped\r\ncarefully away from the Irish potato patches and acres of turf.\r\n\r\nIt was alleged that prosperity of nations was a good deal owing to\r\ntenant-right.\r\n\r\n'I do not think so,' said I, 'because Donegal and Kerry have\r\napproximately the same value and area, same number of miles of road and\r\nsea frontage. There is extreme tenant-right in Donegal and none in\r\nKerry, yet the prosperity of the farmers in Kerry is extremely superior\r\nto those of Donegal.'\r\n\r\n'There is too much tenant-right in Donegal,' said Mr. Chichester\r\nFortescue, who was examining me.\r\n\r\n'Not if it is a good thing,' I replied, 'for then you could not have too\r\nmuch.'\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw Lefevre's Commission on the housing of the working classes in\r\nIreland was very uninteresting. 'Oxen are stalled, pigs are styed or\r\ntake possession of the cabin, but what is done for the Irish labourers?'\r\nasked a passionate mob-orator, and in many cases it might have been\r\nanswered that a good deal more has been done for them than the idle\r\nruffians deserve. I had no difficulty in showing that landlords were\r\nalways willing to give assistance in housing labourers, and when an\r\nex-mayor of Cork on the Commission seemed to doubt my assertions, I\r\nmight have retorted that though he was used to factory hands, yet he had\r\nnever bothered himself how they lived out of work time.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Devonshire was on this board. He has obtained his great and\r\nhonourable reputation by conscientiously slumbering through many duties.\r\nHis tastes are for racing and shooting, but from sheer patriotism he has\r\ndevoted himself to politics with all the energy of his lethargic manner,\r\nwhich successfully conceals abnormal common-sense. It was he, more than\r\nany other man, who saved Ireland from Home Rule, though as an Irish\r\nlandlord he has not come much to the fore, because his vast English\r\nestates are immeasurably more important than those situated round\r\nLismore. This picturesque town was once called the abode of saints, but\r\nonly antiquarians remember that its university was once so important\r\nthat Alfred the Great went there to study, and that in the old castle\r\nHenry II held a Parliament. The Cavendishs rebuilt the latter, and both\r\nin appearance and position it much resembles Warwick Castle. It has not\r\nvery many bedrooms, and when the King was first expected, among various\r\nextensive alterations, a bathroom was put up. The Duke has generally\r\nvisited Lismore twice a year, and has never stood unduly on his dignity,\r\nbut been approachable by all, and reasonable about everything, which has\r\nalso been characteristic of his political views.\r\n\r\nLord Bessborough presided over a Commission on Irish Land Laws. He was a\r\nvery kind, very lean man, who was wont in old age to walk about London\r\nwrapped in a black cape, and was idolised at Harrow, where twenty\r\ngenerations of boys knew him and his brothers and valued their unabated\r\ninterest in school cricket. Baron Dowse, a judge I have already\r\nmentioned, the O'Conor Don, and Mr. Shaw, were the members who put\r\nquestions to me. I remember the O'Conor Don was much impressed when I\r\nmentioned I had made six tours in Scotland, and had been in Holland, in\r\nBelgium, in France, in Germany, in Italy, and just before in Spain, to\r\ninquire into the state of agriculture. I said that if a man persisted in\r\nfarming badly I would serve him with notice to quit even if he paid his\r\nrent, and I pointed out that there were three hundred thousand occupiers\r\nof land in Ireland whose holdings were under £8 Poor Law valuation, and\r\nthese occupiers, when their potatoes fail, have nothing to fall back\r\nupon but relief work, starvation, or emigration, and I further laid\r\nbefore the Commission a purchase scheme. There would be twenty years'\r\npurchase-money to be lent by the State, two years' purchase to be found\r\nby the tenant and two years more at the end of ten years. Thus the\r\nlandlord would get a price for his property that would induce him to\r\nsell (reductions had not then been wholesale) and the tenant would get a\r\nlease for ever with abolition of rent at the end of thirty-five years by\r\npaying a fine of two years' rent down and two more at the end of ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThey would not have it. Who ever expected that Justice would lift the\r\nbandage from her eyes for the sake of fair play to the landlord?\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury had a Commission on the working of the Land Act of 1881.\r\nLord Dunraven, Lord Pembroke, and Lord Cairns were on it, the latter\r\nbeing chairman. He was so austere that, when he was made Lord\r\nChancellor, it was said he had swallowed the mace and could not digest\r\nit. His law may have been profound, but it was never relieved by a gleam\r\nof humour, and his ecclesiastical proclivities were of the lowest Church\r\ntype. For some time he nominated Tory bishops, and it was declared he\r\nwas so evangelical that he would have suggested any clergyman for a\r\nvacant bishopric who promised to forego the ecclesiastical gaiters. His\r\nhorror of Anthony Trollope's novels was notorious, especially his\r\ndislike of Mrs. Proudie and her attendant divines.\r\n\r\nI said the working of the Land Act was ruin to Irish landlords, and\r\ncited a case. A Kerry gentleman had an estate of £1200 rent roll, with a\r\nmortgage of £8000 which involved charges of £400 a year, a jointure\r\ntithes and head rent took £400 more. The Commissioners by so cutting\r\ndown the rent by £400 made a clean sweep of what that landlord had to\r\nlive on. Fortunately, he had his mother's fortune of £40,000, which his\r\ngrandfather had wisely provided should not be invested in Irish lands,\r\nhaving, in fact, established a contingency in case his grandson should\r\nbe dispossessed of the property he had held for generations, by a\r\nGovernment truckling to blustering 'no-renters.'\r\n\r\nBefore Lord Cowper's Commission on the same subject, I said much the\r\nsame thing over again and realised that Royal Commissions are most\r\nvaluable for the purpose of shelving pregnant topics. The only good\r\nderived from these official inquiries is that the witnesses get their\r\nexpenses and the Government printers have a lucrative contract.\r\n\r\nThere is a story told of a witness who was being brought over to London\r\nto give evidence.\r\n\r\n'Patrick,' said the priest, 'you'll be having to mind what you're saying\r\nover there. Perjury won't help you no more than I can, my poor fellow.'\r\n\r\n'What happens if I get a bit wide of the truth then, father?'\r\n\r\n'You won't get your expenses, my son.'\r\n\r\n'Holy Mother, to think of that! I'll be so careful that I won't know how\r\nmany legs the blessed pig has that's round the cabin all day long.'\r\n\r\nSir Edward Fry's Commission had none of the tinsel of big names nor the\r\ntawdriness of aristocratic apathy. Sir Edward meant to find the truth,\r\nand so did his colleagues--all practical men. What they did was to\r\nstrike against the hard rock of party government which was too adamant\r\nto receive the evidence sown by these gardeners. Dr. Anthony Traill, who\r\nwas one of the Commissioners, has in this very year of grace been made\r\nProvost of Trinity, and from what I saw of him I am certain he will be\r\nthe apostle of fair play between undergraduates and dons.\r\n\r\nI answered over five hundred questions and rammed home one or two\r\npoints. For instance, I expressed my disapproval of a system by which a\r\nman who is a sub-Commissioner at the hearing on the first term may\r\nbecome the Court valuer on the next.\r\n\r\nIn valuation, it is wrong that men from the north should be sent to\r\nvalue in the south, or _vice versâ_, and to prove that I cited the\r\nexample of my tenant, Anne Delane. Her rent was fixed first term in 1883\r\nfor £34, 10s. In 1896, for second term, the sub-Commissioner fixed it at\r\n£23, 10s., and on appeal it was raised to £25. Mr. O'Shaughnessy, who\r\nwas one of the sub-Commissioners on the first term, acted as a Court\r\nvaluer on the second. On the first time he allowed £103, 6s. 9d. for\r\ndrains and buildings, and on the second omitted it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Hoffman, who held a farm at a rent of £30, I reduced it\r\nto £20 in 1881. In 1896 he went into court, and the County Court judge\r\nreduced it to £15, and on appeal he got it again reduced to £13.\r\n\r\nOn land which came into my own hands after 1881, I was able to get rents\r\nover 50 per cent. in excess of those fixed by the sub-Commissioners. In\r\nthe case of Patrick Quill, the farm on which the rent was cut down from\r\n£20 to £16 was sold for £300 with a charge of £9 on it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Michael Callaghan, Colonel Hickson expended £300 and\r\nCallaghan £100 on the farm, for which the rent was £70, and he sold his\r\ninterest for £700.\r\n\r\nThis perpetual wrangling and litigation is ruinous, for every man is\r\nfarming down his land and letting it deteriorate as fast as he can; and\r\nthere is a most marked difference in the county between those who have\r\nbought their land and those who are tenants. When a judicial rent was\r\nfixed and a tenant came into Court for a second judicial rent, I think\r\nthe landlord should have been at liberty to stop him by tendering the\r\nfarmer twenty years' purchase; that would give him a reduction of 20 per\r\ncent, and make him a proprietor in the course of time.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 at Milltown Fair, yearlings were selling for 30s. apiece. The\r\nsame cattle now are selling for £5, and Kerry is a great stock-breeding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard to define a landlord, and you will hear of some being\r\nlandlords who do not get a shilling from their estates. Under these\r\ncircumstances they would be like the fox in Æsop's fable who had lost\r\nhis own tail.\r\n\r\nTo show how the Land Act works, on the Harenc estate I was offered\r\ntwenty-seven years' purchase before the Act for a holding, and at the\r\ntime of the Commission they offered me sixteen years' purchase on\r\ntwo-thirds of the rent.\r\n\r\nOne other Commission besides that of the _Times_ remains to be\r\nmentioned. Lord Balfour of Burleigh, a dour Scot with a lot of gumption\r\nin his head, was chairman of one on Imperial _versus_ local taxation. My\r\neasy task was to show the excess of the latter in Kerry, which is the\r\nhighest taxed county in the three kingdoms.\r\n\r\nWhen a man thinks of the vast amount of information buried beyond all\r\nprobable excavation in the Blue Books of the last fifty years, he may\r\nwell break into Carlyle-like diatribes against the waste of the whole\r\nthing--which is paid for out of the taxpayer's pocket.\r\n\r\nAlluding to all these Commissions reminds me that there were three Land\r\nCommissioners--Mr. Bewlay, who was very deaf; Mr. FitzGerald, who was\r\nrather hasty; and Mr. Wrench, who consistently absented himself to\r\nattend the Congested Board.\r\n\r\nSo they were respectively, though not respectfully, called, 'The judge\r\nwho could not hear, the judge who would not hear, and the judge who is\r\nnot here.' This was one of the witticisms of my clever friend, Mr.\r\nRobert Martin--'Bally-hooley'-one of the very few men who can write a\r\ngood Irish song, and sing it well, into the bargain.\r\n\r\nI appeared in the witness-box in the case of O'Donnell _v._ the _Times_.\r\nI suppose people buy newspapers to obtain information, or else to get a\r\npennyworth of lies to induce equanimity in bearing the income-tax, the\r\nweather, and all other ills that an unnatural Government is responsible\r\nfor; and I further suppose a halfpenny paper has to condense its\r\ninaccuracies, and serve them up in tabloid form for mental indigestion.\r\nHowever, that is as it may be; anyhow, I had a hearty laugh at the\r\n_Star_, which wrote:--\r\n\r\n'A look round the Court again this morning brought the strange\r\nimpression which one now always feels on entering the Court. The space\r\nis so comparatively small, but one feels as though it were all Ireland\r\nin microcosm. You see representatives of every class in the terrible\r\nconflict of war, of rival passions, hatred, and traditions. This man\r\nwith the large nose, the large and disfigured face, is Mr. Hussey, and\r\nthose scars that you see, and the distortion of the features, are\r\nperchance marks left by some desperate and homicidal tenant avenging his\r\nwrongs.'\r\n\r\nThat 'perchance' is good, considering my riding misadventure in County\r\nCork, of which I gave an account earlier.\r\n\r\nAs for the Parnell Commission, it was the outcome of superb patriotism\r\non the part of the _Times_. That great organ, in the spirit of purest\r\ndevotion to the best interests of England and Ireland, honestly\r\nattempted to expose treachery, and to denounce treason. Hundreds of\r\ncolumns of the valuable space at their daily disposal, as well as\r\nthousands of pounds earned by the highest journalism of any country,\r\nwere freely lavished in this tremendous denunciation, known as\r\n'Parnellism and Crime.' The crime of Pigott eventually saved Parnell and\r\nhis followers. But the last word on that has not yet been spoken.\r\nAnother pen than mine may, perchance before long, tell the whole truth\r\nabout that tragic episode, and explain what is still an unsolved riddle\r\nin all dispassionate minds. Without challenging and exciting the\r\nstrongest racial prejudices, it will be impossible to lift the veil, and\r\nI have no intention of affording even the slightest preliminary peep\r\nbehind the scenes of that dramatic affair. The wheels of God grind\r\nslowly, and they ground exceeding small almost before the absurd\r\nexultation of Nationalist relief over the Pigott episode had abated. It\r\nis almost time to treat the whole affair from the historical point of\r\nview, and then the idol of Home Rule will be pulverised. However, that\r\nis another story in which I have no chapter to write.\r\n\r\nMy own share in the Parnell Commission was on November 29, 1888, on the\r\ntwenty-third day. I was examined by the Attorney-General, the present\r\nLord Chief Justice, and the most popular and most honourable of men. At\r\nthat very time, I have heard, he sang each Sunday in the surpliced choir\r\nof a Kensington church, and I suppose he is the very best chairman of a\r\ncommittee or of a public meeting of our own or any other time. A\r\nParnellite once said he had the unctuousness of a retired grocer, but\r\nwas contradicted by a more reverent English Radical, who said, 'No, he\r\nhas the unction of grace,' whereas, the truth is, he has the platform\r\nmanner with him always.\r\n\r\nI told the Court I had been a Kerry magistrate for the previous\r\nthirty-seven years, and, after deposing to the earlier state of my\r\nproperty, I insisted that moonlighting and 'land-grabbing' were unknown\r\nterms before 1880. My examination under the Attorney-General was, in\r\nfact, too practical and useful to provide amusement for latter day\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nMy cross-examination was begun by Sir Charles Russell, who led off with\r\na sneer about my being the most popular man in the county, and, when I\r\nadhered to other statements, he added, 'Well, a very popular man. I will\r\nnot put you on too high a pinnacle.' (Laughter.) Then for an hour and a\r\nhalf he plied me with the best balanced statistical questions I ever\r\nheard put in a hostile spirit, and without a note I could answer every\r\none. After considerable hesitation I admitted on consideration that\r\nthere was in Kerry one farmer benefiting by the Act of 1870. I have\r\nnever heard since that he was caught and exhibited as the solitary\r\noutward and visible sign of the inward and legal benefit of the\r\nlegislative force of Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. Lockwood, to whom, as artist, I had been serving as a model,\r\nevidently preferred to handle me with pencil rather than with questions,\r\nfor he was almost as brief as Mr. Reid. It is my view that they both had\r\nconsigned me to petrification under Sir Charles Russell, and finding me\r\nalive and kicking, thought me too tough to expire under such _coups de\r\ngrace_ as they could inflict.\r\n\r\nWe came to banter when Mr. Michael Davitt suggested that the young men\r\nof Castleisland took part in nocturnal raids because there was no such\r\nsocial inducement to keep them quiet, as a music-hall or a theatre; but\r\nI told him there ought to have been no inducement to them to shoot their\r\nneighbours, and that Castleisland was past redemption.\r\n\r\nHe blandly alluded to my popularity with the tenants before 1880; but I\r\nonly said that I got on fairly well with them, for I do not think that\r\nany agent was ever really popular.\r\n\r\n'Relatively?' insidiously.\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nThen came this curious question, put with a gentleness that would have\r\naroused the suspicion of a babe:--\r\n\r\n'Did you ever say, in reply to a question put to you by Mr. Townsend\r\nTrench as to why you were not shot, that you had told the tenants that\r\nif anything happened to you he would succeed you as agent?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I did say so; but it is not original, because it is what Charles\r\nII. said to James II.'\r\n\r\nThis historic reference, which elicited laughter in Court, did not seem\r\nintelligible to my questioner, but some better informed person probably\r\nsoon quoted it to him:--\r\n\r\n'Depend on it, brother James, they will never shoot me to make you\r\nking.'\r\n\r\nFrom the kid-glove amenities of Mr. Davitt to the aggressive harshness\r\nof Mr. Biggar was a sharp contrast. He heckled me vigorously, and I\r\nretorted to him pretty hotly. A great deal had been expected of this\r\ncross-examination, but the general opinion was that I gave rather better\r\nthan I received. Coolness is the despair of cross-examiners, and I think\r\nmine made more impression on the Court than the impulsiveness of a dozen\r\ninaccurate Nationalists.\r\n\r\nMr. Biggar asked:--\r\n\r\n'You said you were popular in the district up to 1880?'\r\n\r\nI retorted with emphasis:--\r\n\r\n'I never had a serious threat until you mentioned my name in\r\nCastleisland, and then people told me, 'Get police protection at once,\r\nor you will be shot!'\r\n\r\nThat made the Court laugh. Mr. Biggar did not appreciate the humour. He\r\nreturned to the charge viciously:--\r\n\r\n'Did not some of your sympathisers light a bonfire in 1878 at\r\nCastleisland on account of the triumphs of your buying the Harenc\r\nestate? and did not the population of Castleisland, who knew your\r\ncharacter, scatter that bonfire, and put it out?'\r\n\r\n'I heard they had a row over it. There were nine bonfires lighted in\r\nKerry after I succeeded. I was fairly popular until you held up my name\r\nas a subject for murder in Castleisland. You said Hussey might be a very\r\nbad man, but you would take care of one thing--that if any person was\r\ncharged with shooting him, or any other agent, they would be defended,\r\nwhich meant they would be paid.'\r\n\r\nMr. Biggar did not appear to relish the line he was on, and shunted to\r\nanother topic; but he could not shake my view that the rents of 1880\r\nwere, on the average, twenty-five per cent. lower than in 1840.\r\n\r\n'You bought the Harenc estate over the heads of the tenants?'\r\n\r\n'No, I did not.'\r\n\r\n'You spoke about an address which you received from the tenants when you\r\nwere a candidate for Tralee?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\nThen, with the snarl of a wild beast, Mr. Biggar blurted out:--\r\n\r\n'Have you any idea whether this was got up by the bailiffs on your\r\nproperty?'\r\n\r\n'I am quite certain it was not, because I had no bailiffs on the\r\nproperty. I gave an immense deal of employment, and I believe that had\r\nsomething to do with it.'\r\n\r\nMr. Biggar presently sat down, having made less of me than he and his\r\nfriends hoped.\r\n\r\nOn re-examination, the Attorney-General observed:--\r\n\r\n'You say one of the bonfires, lighted when you succeeded, was put out. I\r\nsuppose the Irish people are not very averse to a row at times?'\r\n\r\n'Oh no.'\r\n\r\n'And bonfires do produce rows at times?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly.'\r\n\r\n'Your popularity did not depend on one bonfire?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\nNor did my life, fortunately, depend on the good will of Messrs.\r\nParnell, Biggar, and their associates.\r\n\r\nWith reference to my freedom in telling the truth, an application was\r\nmade against me, in July 1891, for an attachment of the Land Court. It\r\nended abortively, and permitted me to continue with perfect impunity to\r\ngive in letters to the _Times_ evidence I was debarred from giving in\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nI certainly did not miss a chance of pointing out the proper path to the\r\nCommissioners, and I have taken an even affectionate interest in every\r\ndepartment of the Land Commission. Sarcastically, a Home Rule paper\r\npolitely christened me as the fatherly patron of the Court, and informed\r\nme that my own conscience had given up communication with me, in\r\nconsequence of the many snubs it had received.\r\n\r\nThe intimate knowledge of my most private affairs that this purports to\r\nrepresent proves the empty-headedness of the writer, and when he added\r\nthat the strong indictment rebounded off my hide because I had heard\r\nmyself a hundred times denounced in language equally eloquent, I can\r\nonly agree that he was a mere lisping babe in comparison with some\r\nadjectival denunciators who, to their regret, find I am still alive and\r\nequal to them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nLATER DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith advancing years comes a change in the point of view, for\r\nanticipation contracts even more than retrospect expands. Associates of\r\nearly days have passed away, and where I was once one of a battalion,\r\nto-day I am only a survivor of the old guard. This is not a cause for\r\nsadness, but an incentive to take the best of what remains of life,\r\nthough at times chills and other ills, including doctors, drugs, and\r\nincome-tax, do their best to depress the survivor. It has been said to\r\nbe a characteristic of Irish humour that tears are very near the\r\nlaughter, and sometimes the unshed tears over lost opportunities must be\r\nthe chief bitterness of age--one which I have been mercifully spared.\r\n\r\nAfter all, youth may round the world away, as Charles Kingsley wrote;\r\nbut when the wheels are run down, to find at home the face I loved when\r\nall was young is the blessing of life, and when, at our golden wedding,\r\nour children called us Darby and Joan, I am sure my wife and I were\r\nquite willing to answer to the names.\r\n\r\nThis was happiness very different to that of George IV., who, when the\r\ndeath of Napoleon was announced to him in the words:--\r\n\r\n'Sir, your great enemy is dead,' exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n'Is she? By Gad!' thinking it was his wife.\r\n\r\nI remember an amusing case that occurred in our own family. One of my\r\nkith and kin, who had been married in the year of the battle of\r\nWaterloo, died at the ripe old age of a hundred and three.\r\n\r\nThere was a faithful old fellow on the estate who was much attached to\r\nher, and this was his view, just before her end:--\r\n\r\n'I am sorry to hear the old mistress is dying, very sorry indeed, for\r\nshe's been a good mistress to us all. Maybe if she had taken snuff she'd\r\nhave lived to a good old age,' which suggests wonder as to what his\r\nconception of longevity really was. Probably the famous Countess of\r\nDesmond, who died from the effects of a fall from a cherry-tree in her\r\none hundred and fortieth year, would have satisfied him.\r\n\r\nI have already observed that much of my later years has been spent, much\r\nagainst my will, in London, and no portion of this period was so\r\nsatisfactory to me as my friendship with Mr. J.A. Froude, which I regard\r\nas one of the privileges of my life.\r\n\r\nMy first acquaintance with him was in consequence of reading his\r\n_English in Ireland_, which I found so accurate and informative that I\r\nwrote to ask him for an interview. I came to like him very much, not\r\nonly because he was the most gifted writer I have met, but also because\r\nhe understood Ireland better than any other Englishman.\r\n\r\nMy first conversation with him was in his house in Onslow Gardens, and\r\nthere I very frequently sat for hours with him, and he also presented me\r\nwith copies of all his books, with an autograph letter on the fly-leaf\r\nof each. I think the recent Land Purchase Act, having been followed by\r\nincreased agitation for Home Rule in Ireland, bears out what he said\r\nabout the folly of trying to reconcile the irreconcilables, and also\r\nbears out what Lord Morris called the 'criminal idiotcy' of attempting\r\nto satisfy eighty Irish members, forty of whom would have to starve\r\ndirectly they were satisfied.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, Mr. Froude never contemplated standing for\r\nParliament, which would not have been a congenial atmosphere for him,\r\nthough I am convinced he would have made more mark at Westminster than\r\nhis friend Mr. Lecky, whom I never had the pleasure of meeting.\r\n\r\nPeople to-day seem to regard Mr. Froude simply as the Boswell of\r\nCarlyle, and, forgetting his own great services to historical\r\nliterature, degrade him to the mere chronicler of the bilious sage of\r\nChelsea. This is absolutely a distortion of fact, and one calculated to\r\ndo injury to the memory of both these famous men. Therefore it may be of\r\nreal utility to state that during my long and very intimate acquaintance\r\nwith Mr. Froude, he never mentioned the name of Carlyle to me but once,\r\nand that was to describe a conversation between Lord Wolseley and\r\nCarlyle, which dealt with the contemporary situation in Ireland. There\r\nwas, therefore, nothing to show me that my friend 'was utterly absorbed\r\nin the Carlyles, and had no thought for any one else.' On the contrary,\r\nhe was a man full of keen interests, of which they were only one, and,\r\nas far as I saw, an entirely subordinate one. He was a broad-minded man,\r\nwho hated petty misconception or a narrow view of anything, and he would\r\nhave been horrified at the prurient indecency with which the most\r\nprivate affairs of the Carlyles have been exposed and distorted to\r\nplease a public which really has a higher moral tone than is possessed\r\nby those who have gibbeted the defenceless dead.\r\n\r\nMr. Froude was not addicted to talking much about his own works, but I\r\nremember his telling me that _Oceana_ had paid him best of them all, and\r\nI think his view therein that the colonies will recede from England when\r\nthey are strong enough, following the example of the United States, is\r\naccurate. Just tax Canada as Ireland has been taxed, and see how long\r\nthe Canadians will be contented. The ministers of George III. tried that\r\npolicy on the United States with the result that, before many years,\r\nGeorge had to receive the Plenipotentiary Minister of dominions over\r\nwhich he himself had once reigned. It is absurd to compare Ireland with\r\nYorkshire, as has been done, for Ireland once had a separate Parliament,\r\nand the Union was a matter of agreement, the outcome of which was that\r\nMr. Childers's Commission found she was taxed three millions more than\r\nshe should have been. The colonies are on the alert, with all the rather\r\nirritable uppishness of youth on the verge of manhood, and their younger\r\ngenerations are sure to take full advantage of any tactless conduct of\r\nthe British Government. Such was Froude's view, and nothing has happened\r\nsince his death to shake its inherent probability. The waves of Imperial\r\npatriotism in war time go for very little, for Ireland is admittedly\r\ndisloyal, and yet Irish soldiers and Irish regiments were absolutely the\r\nmost successful in South Africa.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government was introducing some quack measure into Ireland,\r\nFroude wrote to me:--\r\n\r\n'I see they are putting some fresh sticks under the Irish pot, so it\r\nwill soon boil over.'\r\n\r\nWhich it did, with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nTo the end of his days Froude was a great reader, but his interest in\r\nChurch affairs and in ecclesiastical differences had completely died\r\naway. He told me that the most accurate man of business of any period\r\nwas Philip of Spain, and that his notes and memoranda were a marvel of\r\npractical aptitude. He derived the chief information for his _History of\r\nEngland_ from Spanish despatches, and would to-day have benefited\r\nconsiderably by the translations of Major Martin Hume.\r\n\r\nPersonally Froude had no cranks; his disposition was most urbane, whilst\r\nhe was very neat in his appearance and also in his handwriting. It would\r\ncertainly be of interest to give a few of his racy letters, too often\r\nundated, which I have preserved. Unfortunately, his executors firmly\r\nrefuse the necessary legal consent, so that I am compelled to make my\r\nbook irreparably the poorer by omitting what should have been one of its\r\nmost attractive contents. In justice to Froude's memory, I ought to add\r\nthat there was nothing in his correspondence with me that would have\r\ndiminished his high repute. I mention this because otherwise busybodies\r\nmight have misinterpreted the arbitrary action of his executors to the\r\ndetriment of his fame.\r\n\r\nA later friendship than that with Froude also must have a sincere\r\nallusion in these pages, for I have derived much pleasure from my\r\nassociation with Sir Henry Howorth, a ripe old lawyer of Portuguese\r\nextraction, who has rendered valuable political service by his polemical\r\nletters to the _Times_, on which I can pass a most favourable opinion.\r\nHis histories of the Mongols, the Mammoth, and the Flood are possibly\r\nmore permanent, but they are not of such contemporary note. At any rate,\r\nI respect them from a distance, whilst I admire the political effusions\r\nas the capital work of a comrade under arms, and one who is not afraid\r\nto verbally bludgeon any formidable contemporary Hooligans.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Howorth occasionally breaks out into a story, though he is\r\nmore frequently a listener to mine. This is one of his that I happen to\r\nrecall:--\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of Richmond gave a dinner, at which a distinguished Frenchman\r\nsat next the Mayor's son, and on replying for the guests in imperfect\r\nEnglish, observed:--\r\n\r\n'I am vary happy to be here, and to meet my young friend, who is a sheep\r\nof the old bloke,' meaning, of course, a chip of the old block.\r\n\r\nI plead guilty to have materially increased the interest felt by Sir\r\nHenry in Irish affairs, which is not diminished by the fact that a niece\r\nof Lord Ashbourne is married to his son.\r\n\r\nI think it was to him that I recommended another panacea for the evils\r\nof Ireland, namely, that it would be a good plan to exchange Ireland for\r\nHolland, for the Dutch would reclaim Ireland, and the Irish would\r\nneglect the banks of Holland, with the eventual result that the living\r\nIrish question would be washed away.\r\n\r\nJust now I alluded to a mayor, which reminds me of a story about an\r\nIrish mayoress. As his Majesty has by this time been entertained at\r\nseveral Corporation luncheons, it is not invidious to give the tale.\r\n\r\nThe Mayoress, who was the heroine of the festal occasion in question,\r\nfelt completely overpowered by the royal society in which she found\r\nherself, and when seated at the meal next to the King, was absolutely\r\nunable to articulate any reply at all to the observations he addressed\r\nto her, so eventually he gave her up, and turned his colloquial\r\nattentions to the lady on the other side.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, fortified by the champagne, the Mayoress grew more\r\ncourageous, and, admiring the gentleman in full uniform on her right,\r\nsaid to him:--\r\n\r\n'Might I be so bowld as to ask whether you are Lord Plunket?'\r\n\r\n'No,' he replied, with a smile, 'I am not.'\r\n\r\n'Would you mind telling me who you are, for I'm sure I don't know?'\r\n\r\n'I am the Duke of Connaught,' complaisantly replied her neighbour, upon\r\nwhich she gasped:--'Oh, God in Heaven, another of them!' and subsided\r\ninto unbroken silence for the rest of the repast.\r\n\r\nAnother amusing case of mistaken identity occurred when Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas concocting his treasonable Home Rule Bill. He had been informed that\r\nLord Clonbrook would be able to give him invaluable information, so he\r\ntold his wife to ask him to luncheon. She, however, mistaking the name,\r\ninvited the late Lord Clonmel, a jovial sportsman known to his friends\r\nby the nickname of 'Old Sherry.'\r\n\r\nSomewhat surprised at being thus honoured, Lord Clonmel consulted a few\r\ncronies, who all advised him to accept, and in due course he proceeded\r\nto Downing Street, where he found the French Ambassador was the only\r\nother guest. It is possible that Mr. Gladstone thought him a little odd\r\nand his attire somewhat demonstrative, but he was prepared for any\r\neccentricity in an Irish peer, and hardly noticed how excellently his\r\nguest was doing justice to the meal, whilst preserving impenetrable\r\nsilence. Directly it was over, the Prime Minister took him apart, and\r\nsaid:--'Now I want you, privately and confidentially, to give me your\r\nview of the exact relation between landlord and tenant in Ireland.'\r\n\r\n'Absolute hell, my dear boy, absolute hell,' was the emphatic reply of\r\nthe old sportsman.\r\n\r\nThat confidential conversation went no further; but I have never been\r\nsure that Lord Clonmel in the least overstated the case.\r\n\r\nThis renewed allusion to the lower regions that appears so closely\r\nconnected with Irish affairs reminds me of an amusing incident which\r\ntook place in a Dublin tram. Two members of the fair sex were discussing\r\ntheir plans for the summer in the interior of a car, and one of them in\r\na mincing brogue said to the other:--\r\n\r\n'I think I shall go to England this summer; it is so difficult in\r\nIreland to get away from the vulgar Irish.'\r\n\r\n'Faix,' screamed in much indignation an old Biddy sitting opposite, 'if\r\nit's the vulgar Irish you want to avoid, and the English you want to be\r\nmeeting, it's to hell you must go, and you'd better go there this\r\nsummer.'\r\n\r\nThat's the sort of quick retort which a Scotchman calls Irish insolence,\r\nbut then, who expects appreciation of real wit from any one canny? Wit\r\nis irresponsible, a truly Irish propensity.\r\n\r\nThe two mincing young women were almost as much disgusted as another old\r\nlady who found herself opposite a stalwart working man, who incensed her\r\nby his frequent expectoration. Gathering her skirts round her somewhat\r\nample form, she called the conductor and asked:--\r\n\r\n'Is spitting allowed in this tram?'\r\n\r\n'By all manes, me lady,' was the gallant reply, 'shpit anywhere you\r\nlike.'\r\n\r\nWhile alluding to trams, I cannot forbear relating one other Dublin\r\ntale, which Lord Morris picked up from me and was fond of telling. Its\r\nbrief course runs thus:--\r\n\r\n'Would you tell me, if you plaze, where I'll find the Blackrock tram?'\r\nasked a fussy little old woman of a policeman, busily engaging in\r\nmanoeuvring the traffic of a crowded street.\r\n\r\n'In wan minute you'll find it in the shmall of your back,' was the\r\nlaconic reply.\r\n\r\nThe mere allusion to a query suggests how the British tourist invariably\r\nstarts trying to discuss the Irish question directly he is across the\r\nChannel, and the insoluble part to any Saxon is that half the Irish do\r\nnot seem to desire a solution at all.\r\n\r\n'What a fine country this would be if it were peaceful,' observed a\r\nthoughtful Britisher, with a Cook's ticket in his pocket, on Killarney\r\nLake.\r\n\r\n'Peace! What would we do with it?' was the scornful reply of his\r\nboatman, surprised for once into ejaculating the truth.\r\n\r\nSome landlords know how hopeless it is to attempt to prevail against\r\nthese sons of our epoch.\r\n\r\n'It has been of no use to hold up a candle to the hydra-headed devil,'\r\nsaid one landlord to me about his tenants, 'for affability is more\r\nexpensive than absenteeism. If I say, \"Good morning, Tom,\" the fellow\r\nexpects twenty per cent. off the rent, and \"How's your family?\" is\r\nconsidered to imply forty per cent, abatement'--and that cannot be\r\ncalled putting a premium on good fellowship from the landlord's point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nI have not said much about the way in which the Irish in America foster\r\ninsurrection, because it does not come within my own province. But I\r\nhave before me the type-written essay on the subject composed by a Kerry\r\nlandlord, who, in his lifetime, had exceptional opportunities of judging\r\nof this in New York, and from it I am tempted to take a few sentences as\r\nthe manuscript is never likely to see the light of print.\r\n\r\n'There are three distinct types of the Irish-American Home Ruler, who\r\nhave been and are even now supporting with their dollars or their\r\neloquence, the \"Irish Cause\" as it is somewhat vaguely termed\r\nthroughout the United States. They can be distinguished as follows:--\r\n\r\n  '1. The American--born Irishman of immediate Irish descent.\r\n\r\n  '2. The native Irishman who has emigrated from Ireland.\r\n\r\n  '3. The American Irish-American of long American descent, who, though\r\n  not inheriting a drop of Irish blood, is yet a vigorous if not\r\n  obstreperous ally of the Irish party in America. This last is the most\r\n  striking of the three, as on the face of it, he would not appear to\r\n  have any logical _raison d'être_ as a political entity, but in reality\r\n  exerts a powerful influence in favour of \"the Cause.\"\r\n\r\n'One phase of the methods favoured by Irish-American Home Rulers is the\r\ningenuity with which cable reports, as printed in the newspapers, are\r\nutilised for platform purposes. Let an account be flashed under the\r\nAtlantic descriptive of some agrarian demonstration in Ireland, which\r\nhaving been declared illegal, is dispersed by military. Forthwith the\r\nopportunity is seized, and on some public platform or at some big\r\nbanquet, the fervid orator poses as the champion of human liberty.\r\n\"Another British outrage upon the Irish people! A brutal and licentious\r\nsoldiery let loose to gag free speech and prevent, at the point of the\r\nbayonet, the exercise of the rights of freeman. Thank God, that you and\r\nI my Irish-American fellow-citizens, are living in this glorious\r\nrepublic, where such things are impossible!\"\r\n\r\n'After hearing this amazing outburst, it is well to recall actual facts,\r\nand compare the methods of suppressing riots in the United States and\r\nthe United Kingdom. For example, on July 12, 1871, a number of Orangemen\r\nhad organised a procession through the principal thoroughfares of New\r\nYork, which was resented by a large contingent of Catholic Irishmen, and\r\non a violent collision ensuing, the State militia was called out to\r\nrestore order, a task they most effectually accomplished by firing\r\nvolleys into the crowd of belligerents. The citizen soldiery of America\r\nare accustomed to adopt summary measures with impunity. They possess the\r\nresolution of the Irish constabulary without the uncomfortable\r\nvacillation of Dublin Castle to thwart their efforts.'\r\n\r\nIn the past the Irish vote in America has been hostile to England, and\r\nhas had much to do with that measure of ill-feeling in the United States\r\nwhich has deterred that Union of the Anglo-Saxon races that would enable\r\nthem to lick creation.\r\n\r\nAn example may be cited in the case of Egan. This man was an ex-Fenian\r\nleader, who wielded much influence in Nationalistic circles as far back\r\nas the seventies, and when he was Treasurer of the Land League, he is\r\ndescribed by Mr. Michael Davitt--who ought to have a fine capacity for\r\ndiscriminating degrees of scoundrelism--as the most active and able of\r\nthe Nationalist leaders in Dublin. Some time after the Phoenix Park\r\nmurders he settled in the United States, and whilst distinguishing\r\nhimself by the exceptional violence of his appeals on behalf of\r\noutrageous Ireland, he was actually sent as American Minister to Chili.\r\nThis would not have caused me to notice him here but because it is\r\nnecessary the community should be warned that, unlike a good many of his\r\ncontemporaries and comrades, he is not an extinct volcano. On March 10\r\nof this current year, when still the chief Nationalist in the States, he\r\nhad a long interview with Count Cassini, the Russian Minister at the\r\nRussian Embassy at Washington, just before a meeting of all the\r\ndiplomatic representatives, and the American correspondent of the\r\n_Morning Post_ does not hesitate to accuse Russia of financially\r\nassisting the cause which Egan fosters. This sort of thing ought not to\r\nbe ignored in England. As an international action, it is hitting below\r\nthe belt, and when bad times come again to Ireland the Nationalists will\r\nlook to the Ministers of the Great Bear for funds, and are not likely to\r\nbe disappointed. Still it is curious that a Government which, at home,\r\nexiles Nihilists and other bomb-throwers should, abroad, give\r\ncontributions to the cause that instigated the blowing up of my house,\r\nand the outrages which rendered Ireland so notorious.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago my wife was once more seriously alarmed at Edenburn\r\nby the formidable proclivities of a man P----, who sat all day at my\r\ngate with a gun, which he said he used for shooting rabbits: but we all\r\nknew I was the rabbit he wanted to put in his bag. However, he has gone\r\nto another sphere, and I am spending the present summer of 1904 very\r\nhappily in the same county.\r\n\r\nA couple of letters addressed there showing the way in which an old\r\nwidow expresses herself, when after great labour she has delivered\r\nherself of an epistle, may not prove undiverting. The point is the\r\namount she can obtain from her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Samuel Mr. Hussey Esq.\r\n\r\nSir--I hope you will be good enough to speak to Downing to give me\r\nJustice. They have any amount of cattle, 2 horses, and my son-in-law's\r\nwife carried 78 pounds book account before Mr. Downing got the case in\r\nhands I would get 2 hundred pounds. I think it little for me according\r\nto the means that was theirs. Now sir, two daughters very ritch sir\r\nminding milk and butter and the one taking it away and selling it. My\r\nson is not wright in his health or mind. They turned him against me and\r\nhe is more foolish than your Honour would believe. He says he will give\r\nhis uncle that ran away long ago to America mortgage, that Mr. Downing\r\ngave him power to do what he like and those two daughters are very well\r\noff and they will not allow me to do anything. Sir I am shamed of the\r\nway they are treating me. My health and mind is very good, thanks be to\r\nGod and to you two Sir. They would not give me the price of the habit\r\nthat was berried with their father. Sir it would not pay my debts and\r\nsupport me long. My father lived 100 years. The Judge said I would live\r\nlonger. Sir three hundred pounds is little enough for me according to\r\nthe means that is theirs. If I went into the workhouse I would not take\r\nwhat they wish to give me. £160 they are giving me and I have my\r\nConfidence in God and in your Honour's charity that you will be good\r\nenough to speak for me. If the land don't sell to 5 hundred pounds I\r\nwill give it back to the attorney. Will your Honour tell them and I'll\r\npray to God sir ever to bless you.\r\n\r\nFaithfully,\r\n\r\nMARY LUCY.'\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the same dame favoured me with this further effusion:\r\n\r\n\r\n'Mr. Hussey Esq.\r\n\r\nSir--100 pounds was offered to me before the purchase, a foolish priest\r\nmaking little of me, himself trying to get it for his friends. The\r\nBishop, Sir, is kind to me always. For he knows I was wronged and he\r\ndon't like the foolish priest, and when I complain of him he is very\r\ngood. Sir some good people tell me that anyone at all have no claim but\r\nmyself and I wish it was true as all is very valuable. Mr. Connor is\r\nvery truthful and nice to me Sir when I will see him I am very sure he\r\nwill wish me well and all the good Honourable Gentlemen and yourself are\r\nthe best of all to my equals. I know it very well and I will for ever\r\npray to God in Heaven for you.\r\n\r\nFaithfully,\r\n\r\nMARY LUCY.'\r\n\r\n\r\nSo a landlord and agent, even in 1904, still has a few of the\r\npatriarchal attributes in the eyes of the tenants. But to sift wheat\r\nfrom chaff is easier than to sift truth from the lying blandishments\r\nemployed on such occasions.\r\n\r\nThe reference to the priest shows that though always feared, when the\r\nland-passion seizes a parishioner, he is set at as much defiance as\r\npossible, should he be moderate, and these are the only occasions when\r\nthey venture to tell their confessor unpleasant truths to his face, for\r\nin some country districts they are still convinced that the priests have\r\npower to transform them into frogs and mice.\r\n\r\nA priest once threatened a bibulous parishioner, that if he did not\r\nbecome more sober in his habits, he would change him into a mouse.\r\n\r\n'Biddy, me jewel, I can't believe Father Pat would have that power over\r\nme,' said the man that same evening as the shadows fell, 'but all the\r\nsame you might as well shut up the cat.'\r\n\r\nOver elections the priests have paramount influence as I have already\r\nshown, but may cite an example at the last County election in Kerry,\r\nwhen three candidates stood, Sir Thomas Esmonde (Anti-Parnellite), Mr.\r\nHarrington (Parnellite), and Mr. Palmer (Conservative). The last-named\r\nout of a poll of six thousand obtained seventy votes. One of them was\r\ngiven after the following fashion.\r\n\r\nAn illiterate voter at Killorglin being asked in the polling booth how\r\nhe wished to vote, replied:--\r\n\r\n'For my parish priest.'\r\n\r\n'But he is not a candidate. The three are Esmonde, Palmer, and\r\nHarrington.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, I'll vote for Palmer, because it is more like Father Lawler\r\nthan the others.'\r\n\r\nNaturally all concerned were convulsed with laughter, but the vote was\r\nduly recorded.\r\n\r\nIt is no uncommon thing to see priests carefully teaching illiterate\r\nvoters the appearance of the name of the candidate for whom they are to\r\npoll, and also giving them printed cards merely containing his name, so\r\nthat they can recognise it on the voting-card.\r\n\r\nOf course an Irishman would take a bribe one way and calmly vote\r\nanother. But even this diplomatic tendency is outwitted by the priests,\r\nfor nowadays, when they have any doubt of the political sincerity of a\r\nman, they insist on his declaring himself an illiterate voter. Then the\r\nwhole question of who is to be voted for is gone through audibly and\r\nverbally, so that the honesty of the voter is known to those hanging\r\nround. In the parish of Milltown, the education is as complete as in any\r\nin Ireland, but at the last election, one third of the voters confessed\r\nthemselves illiterate, with the result anticipated by the priest.\r\n\r\nIf the priest understands his parishioner--a thing which admits of no\r\npossible shadow of doubt--it is equally certain that the Englishman does\r\nnot, as is shown by the following frivolous tale, always a favourite of\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n'Paddy,' said a tourist at Killarney, 'I'll give you sixpence if you'll\r\ntell me the biggest lie you ever told in your life.'\r\n\r\n'Begorra, your honour's a gentleman! Give me the sixpence!'\r\n\r\nNo one would have thought of making such an offer to an English loafer,\r\nand no English loafer would have had the wit to so neatly earn his\r\nemolument.\r\n\r\nIt is the assumption of simplicity that does the trick, and so well is\r\nthat put on that it comes close to the real thing.\r\n\r\nThe other day, when the King and Queen were at Punchestown, a Britisher\r\nchartered a car at Naas to drive out to the course, and on the way\r\nremonstrated with the carman on the starved condition of his horse,\r\nwhose ribs would have served for an anatomical study.\r\n\r\n'Well, your honour,' the jarvey explained, 'it's an unlucky horse.'\r\n\r\n'How unlucky?' asked the Englishman.\r\n\r\n'Well, it's this way, your honour. Each morning I toss with that horse\r\nwhether he shall have his feed of oats or I have my glass of whisky, and\r\nwould your honour credit it, the horse has lost these ten days past.'\r\n\r\nI am reminded of the reply given by Lord Derby to a gentleman who sent\r\nhim a dozen of very light claret, which he said would suit his gout.\r\nLord Derby subsequently thanked him, but said he preferred the gout, and\r\nI have no doubt that that horse, had he been able to give tongue, would\r\nhave been an ardent upholder of teetotalism when it ensured him a feed\r\nof oats.\r\n\r\nOne more story of Lord Derby, as I have just mentioned his name:--\r\n\r\nA worthy trader had bothered him to let him stand for a certain borough\r\non the Tory ticket, but the Whig was returned unopposed on the day of\r\nthe nomination, and the candidate was subsequently attacked by Lord\r\nDerby for not coming forward as he had promised.\r\n\r\nThe man was almost as shaky in his aspirates as in his political\r\npropensities, and his reply was:--\r\n\r\n'I would have stood, my lord, but there was a 'itch in the way.'\r\n\r\n'It was the more necessary for you to come to the scratch,' was the\r\nimmediate retort.\r\n\r\nI always find that story popular at the Carlton, where I spend my\r\nafternoons when in London. I was proposed by Mr. James Lowther and\r\nseconded by the Duke of Marlborough, and very much obliged have I been\r\nto them both, for I have many acquaintances there, and it has all the\r\nconveniences of a comfortable hotel, without having to pay extravagantly\r\nfor the privilege of looking at a waiter.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals of reading the papers and listening to other people, I\r\nhave there, as elsewhere, endeavoured to impart what I know to others\r\nwho know nothing about Ireland. They know much more about China or the\r\naboriginal tribes of Australia, in London, than they do on the topics\r\ndearest to me.\r\n\r\nAn English Radical member, after a long chat with my son Maurice,\r\nobserved:--\r\n\r\n'You actually mean to say that if Home Rule were given to Ireland you\r\nwould not be allowed to reside there?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not,' replied Maurice, who knew what he was talking about.\r\n\r\nThe member replied that he could not believe him, but that if he had\r\nknown that that was the real nature of the Bill he would never have\r\nvoted for it.\r\n\r\nI could not desire a better example of English wisdom on this\r\nsubject--one which Lord Rosebery has consigned to a distant date in\r\nfuturity, foreseeing that if the Opposition are to be handicapped with\r\nHome Rule they will not stand a forty to one chance at the next\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThat election will, of course, turn on Protection, and I am therefore\r\ntempted to quote from an article I contributed to _Murray's Magazine_ in\r\nJuly 1887, entitled 'After the Crimes Bill, What Next?' for I feel my\r\nforecast of over fourteen years ago may serve a useful purpose to-day.\r\nIt ran thus:--\r\n\r\n'In my next suggestion I feel that I am treading on dangerous ground;\r\nstill, having undertaken to suggest a remedy for Irish discontent and\r\nanarchy, I must not shrink from offending the prejudices of some of the\r\nwise men of England.\r\n\r\n'Ireland is an agricultural country. There are in Ulster, as in England\r\nand Scotland, factories which support the greater portion of the\r\npopulation, and cause the prosperity of the province; but outside of\r\nUlster, cattle and butter are the staple products. And how does Ireland\r\nstand in her only market, England, as compared with other nations? She\r\nenjoys free trade in butter, no doubt, but so do France and Holland; but\r\nthese countries, while they find an open market in England, tax all\r\nEnglish and Irish productions, and being manufacturing countries\r\nthemselves they can afford to sell butter at so cheap a rate as to swamp\r\nIreland's market. A slight protective duty on foreign butter would be\r\nhailed with gratitude in Ireland, and do more to allay discontent than\r\nany further acts of so-called \"generosity.\"\r\n\r\n'Again, the great thinly peopled countries of the West find in England a\r\nfree market for cattle and flour, and America taxes very highly all\r\nEnglish goods. Why not place Ireland on a par with America, by levying a\r\nslight protective duty on American beef and flour? Every little village\r\nin Ireland formerly had its flour mill, which worked up the corn grown\r\nin the country as well as imported grain. These mills are now generally\r\nidle and the men who worked them ruined. A small duty on manufactured\r\nflour would restore this industry, and enable men with some capital to\r\ngive employment to labour, and to work up in small quantities for the\r\nfarmer, at a cheap rate, their home-grown corn, as well as to grind\r\nimported grain. Our own colonies may have, no doubt, a right to object\r\nto our taxing their goods, but not so foreign countries.\r\n\r\n'The Free Trade system of England would, no doubt, have been successful\r\nif reciprocated. But the question is worth considering, whether the\r\nEnglish people do not now lose more by taxation resulting from the\r\nchronic state of rebellion in Ireland than she gains by bringing in\r\nAmerican beef and flour, and foreign butter and butterine, free, to the\r\nimpoverishment of Ireland, and of the agricultural portions of England\r\nand Scotland? \"Remedial measures\" for an agricultural country are\r\ncertainly not those which spoil its market.'\r\n\r\nDon't dismiss that as pre-Chamberlainese Protection for it is sheer\r\ncommon-sense on a matter of national importance, and what I wrote in\r\n1887, after many years, has become part of the political convictions of\r\na great and an increasing party.\r\n\r\nI wonder what the Protective party will be like when it eventually comes\r\ninto office. Promises out of office are often the whale which only\r\nproduces the sprat of legislation when the time of fulfilment arrives.\r\nThis is an impartial opinion on most Cabinets of the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nOne of the few occasions on which a recent British Government has\r\nrecently shown some signs of appreciating a really keen and capable man\r\nwas when they made Mr. Ellison Macartney, Master of the Mint.\r\n\r\nI wrote and congratulated him, observing that I hoped he would never be\r\nshort of money, but if that was his plight all he had to do was to coin\r\nit for himself.\r\n\r\nI have a bad recollection for faces, and one day in Dublin his father\r\ncame up to me, and seeing I did not remember him, recalled a story with\r\nwhich I had amused him in the lobby of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIt was to this effect, and may prove new to others:--\r\n\r\nComing out of Glasgow one evening two Irishmen waylaid a Scotsman for\r\nthe sake of plunder. He was nearly enough for them both, but numbers\r\nprevailed, and when they had mastered him, after searching his pockets,\r\nthey only found three halfpence.\r\n\r\nSaid one Hibernian to the other:--\r\n\r\n'Glory be to the Saints, Mick, what a fight he made for three\r\nhalfpence.'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' replied the other, 'it was the mercy of the Lord he had not\r\ntuppence, or he'd have killed the pair of us.'\r\n\r\nKilling suggests the Kerry militia, the corps in which no one dies\r\nexcept of good fellowship, one which has done a good deal to unite the\r\ndivergent interests of north and south Kerry, and which provides fine\r\nphysical development for soldiers of all ranks.\r\n\r\nLast year the militia received a grant of £120 from Government to be\r\nexpended on route marching with the band through the county in order to\r\npromote recruiting. The net haul in the Milltown district was the\r\nvillage idiot, who promised to enlist after the next sessions if the\r\njailer did not take him--he being apprehensive of committal to prison.\r\n\r\nBut even this was not enough, for his mother came to a neighbouring\r\nmagistrate, weeping and praying for his remission, because--\r\n\r\n'It was a drunken freak on Patrick, for if the lad had kept his senses,\r\nsure, he would never have done it.'\r\n\r\nAnother Kerry man being asked why his son did not enlist, replied:--\r\n\r\n'Ah, Jamsie was not a big enough scamp for the militia, because you have\r\nto be a great blackguard before you can get in there.'\r\n\r\nWhich shows that the camel and needle's eye trick is easier to perform\r\nthan to induce a country-bred man to enlist in the King's militia;\r\nthough once in, every fellow loves it.\r\n\r\nThis intimation of an army suggests an anecdote of the past war-time.\r\nThe militia was being embodied, and several landlords who held\r\ncommissions were going under canvas with the corps at Gosport. One of\r\nhis tenants stopped a popular landlord on the road and asked:--\r\n\r\n'What do you want to go to be shot at by them Boers for, sir?'\r\n\r\n'To be sure, Tim, my tenants have the first right to shoot me, have they\r\nnot?' was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\nThe fellow roared with laughter at the retort, and after shaking hands,\r\nwished him luck.\r\n\r\nIt was also characteristic of Irish proclivities for a soft-voiced woman\r\non the estate to say to Miss Leeson Marshall:--\r\n\r\n'When the war broke out first we were all praying that the English might\r\nbe beaten out of South Africa. Then when Mr. Marshall went away to the\r\narmy, we thought we should not like his side to lose, so we changed our\r\nprayers round by the blessing of God and His Saints.'\r\n\r\nIf any real impression has been given in these pages of the inconsistent\r\nIrish character, the genuine character of this sentiment will be\r\ncomprehensible. It has been said that an Irishman will tell the truth\r\nabout everything except one thing--that, of course, is a horse. When not\r\nengaged in shooting his landlord, the tenant is by no means disaffected\r\nto him, whilst the female appurtenances, mindful of all the small doles\r\nthey obtain, are much more voluble in their cordial protestations.\r\n\r\nSometimes the women are enigmatical: one does not know if they are\r\nacting out of kindness or from duplicity. For example, not so long ago a\r\ngirl came up to one of my daughters in the road and said to her:--\r\n\r\n'For the love of God tell your mother to order your father's coffin for\r\nhe'll need it, the Saints preserve us.'\r\n\r\nAnd with that she started away before there was time to reply.\r\n\r\nNothing came of it, of course: nothing ever has, of real importance.\r\n\r\nNothing, alas, also seems so often to be the verdict on life when\r\nlooking back. Mine, however, has been too full a one, not only with\r\ngriefs and trials but also with happiness and fun, for me to dismiss it\r\nthus. There has been so much more to live through than to write about,\r\nand yet, in these pages, has been told something which would have gone\r\nfor ever untold if I had not in old age become garrulous. Things\r\nforgotten have been recalled to my mind and may prove suggestive to\r\nother people who read them, and it is my hope, in concluding, that I\r\nhave provided diversion and a little food for reflection.\r\n\r\nI feel that a critic may consider too much that has been set down here\r\nis disconnected, yet if he will let a gramophone record an animated\r\nconversation, he will find that it ebbs and flows with the uncertain\r\nbabbling of a brook--and so it has been with me. Only the other day, in\r\nthe preface to Camden's _History of the British Islands_, I came across\r\nthe phrase:--\r\n\r\n'bookes receive their doome according to the reader's capacitie,'\r\n\r\nand that alone emboldens me to hope for some measure of success for the\r\npresent volume. Readers do not always want serious subjects, and it is\r\nin an hour when they desire a little diversion that I hope my\r\nreminiscences may commend themselves, for in a phrase not unknown in my\r\nnative Kerry, this book consists of 'little things, and that away.'\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbey of St. Denis, Paris, 79.\r\nAbbeyfeale, 253, 259.\r\nAbercorn, Duke of, 165.\r\nAberdeen, Earl of, 167-168.\r\n---- Lady, 167-168.\r\nActs--\r\n  Arrears, 183, 184, 197.\r\n  Crimes, 183, 262.\r\n  Encumbered Estate, 71.\r\n  Habeas Corpus Suspension, 225.\r\n  Irish Church, 44, 180-181.\r\n  Land, _see under_ Land.\r\n  Riot, 251.\r\n  Union, of, 180.\r\n  Westminster, of 1871, 251.\r\nAdams, Mr. Gould, of Kilmachill, 207.\r\nAghabey, 83.\r\nAghadoe, 3, 95, 254.\r\nAgriculture, Commission on, 268.\r\nAlbert, Prince, 163.\r\nAmerica, Irish dissatisfaction fostered in, 289;\r\n  Home Rulers in, 289-290.\r\nAnderson, Rev.
