During the first half of the nineteenth century the\r\nother great national questions were nearly all economic--taxation,\r\ncurrency, banks, transportation, lands,--and they had a strong\r\nmaterial basis, a flavor of self-interest; but though slavery had\r\nalso an economic side, the reasons for the onslaught upon it were\r\nchiefly moral. The first objection brought by the slave-power\r\nagainst the anti-slavery propaganda was the cry of the sacredness\r\nof vested and property rights against attack by sentimentalists;\r\nbut what dignified the whole contest was the very fact that the\r\nsentiment for human rights was at the bottom of it, and that the\r\nabolitionists felt a moral responsibility even though property\r\nowners suffered. The slavery question, which in origin was\r\nsectional, became national as the moral issues grew clearer; and\r\nfinally loomed up as the dominant question through the determination\r\nof both sides to use the power and prestige of the national\r\ngovernment. From the moral agitation came also the personal element\r\nin the struggle, the development of strong characters, like Calhoun,\r\nToombs, Stephens and Jefferson Davis on one side; like Lundy,\r\nLovejoy, Garrison, Giddings, Sumner, Chase, John Brown and Lincoln\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nAmong the many weak spots in the system of slavery none gave such\r\nopportunities to Northern abolitionists as the locomotive powers\r\nof the slaves; a \"thing\" which could hear its owner talking about\r\nfreedom, a \"thing\" which could steer itself Northward and avoid\r\nthe \"patterollers,\" was a thing of impaired value as a machine,\r\nhowever intelligent as a human being. From earliest colonial times\r\nfugitive slaves helped to make slavery inconvenient and expensive.\r\nSo long as slavery was general, every slaveholder in every colony\r\nwas a member of an automatic association for stopping and returning\r\nfugitives; but, from the Revolution on, the fugitives performed the\r\nimportant function of keeping continually before the people of the\r\nstates in which slavery had ceased, the fact that it continued in\r\nother parts of the Union. Nevertheless, though between 1777 and 1804\r\nall the states north of Maryland threw off slavery, the free states\r\ncovenanted in the Federal Constitution of 1787 to interpose no\r\nobstacle to the recapture of fugitives who might come across their\r\nborders; and thus continued to be partners in the system of slavery.\r\nFrom the first there was reluctance and positive opposition to this\r\nobligation; and every successful capture was an object lesson to\r\ncommunities out of hearing of the whipping-post and out of sight of\r\nthe auction-block.\r\n\r\nIn aiding fugitive slaves the abolitionist was making the most\r\neffective protest against the continuance of slavery; but he was\r\nalso doing something more tangible; he was helping the oppressed, he\r\nwas eluding the oppressor; and at the same time he was enjoying the\r\nmost romantic and exciting amusement open to men who had high moral\r\nstandards. He was taking risks, defying the laws, and making himself\r\nliable to punishment, and yet could glow with the healthful pleasure\r\nof duty done.\r\n\r\nTo this element of the personal and romantic side of the slavery\r\ncontest Professor Siebert has devoted himself in this book. The\r\nUnderground Railroad was simply a form of combined defiance of\r\nnational laws, on the ground that those laws were unjust and\r\noppressive. It was the unconstitutional but logical refusal of\r\nseveral thousand people to acknowledge that they owed any regard\r\nto slavery or were bound to look on fleeing bondmen as the property\r\nof the slaveholders, no matter how the laws read. It was also a\r\npractical means of bringing anti-slavery principles to the attention\r\nof the lukewarm or pro-slavery people in free states; and of\r\nconvincing the South that the abolitionist movement was sincere and\r\neffective. Above all, the Underground Railroad was the opportunity\r\nfor the bold and adventurous; it had the excitement of piracy, the\r\nsecrecy of burglary, the daring of insurrection; to the pleasure\r\nof relieving the poor negro's sufferings it added the triumph of\r\nsnapping one's fingers at the slave-catcher; it developed coolness,\r\nindifference to danger, and quickness of resource.\r\n\r\nThe first task of the historian of the Underground Railroad is to\r\ngather his material, and the characteristic of this book is to\r\nconsider the whole question on a basis of established facts. The\r\neffort is timely; for there are still living, or were living when\r\nthe work began, many hundreds of persons who knew the intimate\r\nhistory of parts of the former secret system of transportation;\r\nthe book is most timely, for these invaluable details are now fast\r\ndisappearing with the death of the actors in the drama. Professor\r\nSiebert has rescued and put on record events which in a few years\r\nwill have ceased to be in the memory of living men. He has done for\r\nthe history of slavery what the students of ballad and folk-lore\r\nhave done for literature; he has collected perishing materials.\r\n\r\nReminiscence is of course, standing alone, an insufficient basis\r\nfor historical generalization. On that point Professor Siebert\r\nhas been careful to explain his principle: he does not attempt\r\nto generalize from single memories not otherwise substantiated,\r\nbut to use reminiscences which confirm each other, to search out\r\ntelling illustrations, and to discover what the tendencies were from\r\nnumerous contrasted testimonies. Actual contemporary records are\r\nscanty; a few are here preserved, such as David Putnam's memorandum,\r\nand Campbell's letter; and the crispness which they give to the\r\nnarrative makes us wish for more. The few available biographies,\r\nautobiographies, and contemporary memoirs have been diligently\r\nsought out and used; and no variety of sources has been ignored\r\nwhich seemed likely to throw light on the subject. The ground has\r\nbeen carefully traversed; and it is not likely that much will\r\never be added to the body of information collected by Professor\r\nSiebert. His list of sources, described in the introductory chapter\r\nand enumerated in the Appendices, is really a carefully winnowed\r\nbibliography of the contemporary materials on slavery.\r\n\r\nThe book is practically divided into four parts: the Railroad\r\nitself (Chapters ii, v); the railroad hands (Chapters iii, iv,\r\nvi); the freight (Chapters vii, viii); and political relations and\r\neffects (Chapters ix, x, xi). Perhaps one of the most interesting\r\ncontributions to our knowledge of the subject is the account of\r\nthe beginnings of the system of secret and systematic aid to\r\nfugitives. The evidence goes to show that there was organization\r\nin Pennsylvania before 1800; and in Ohio soon after 1815. The book\r\nthus becomes a much-needed guide to information about the obscure\r\nanti-slavery movement which preceded William Lloyd Garrison, and\r\nto some degree prepared the way for him; and it will prove a\r\nsource for the historian of the influence of the West in national\r\ndevelopment. As yet we know too little of the anti-slavery movement\r\nwhich so profoundly stirred the Western states, including Kentucky\r\nand Missouri, and which came closely into contact with the actual\r\nconditions of slavery. As Professor Siebert points out, most of the\r\nearly abolitionists in the West were former slaveholders or sons of\r\nslaveholders.\r\n\r\nProfessor Siebert has applied to the whole subject a graphic form of\r\nillustration which is at the same time a test of his conclusions.\r\nHow can the scattered reminiscences and records of escapes in\r\nwidely separated states be shown to refer to the results of one\r\norganized method? Plainly by applying them to the actual face of the\r\ncountry, so as to see whether the alleged centres of activity have\r\na geographical connection. The painstaking map of the lines of the\r\nUnderground Railroad \"system\" is an historical contribution of a\r\nnovel kind; and it is impossible to gainsay its evidence, which is\r\nexpounded in detail in one of the chapters of the book. The result\r\nis a gratifying proof of the usefulness of scientific methods in\r\nhistorical investigation; one who lived in an anti-slavery community\r\nbefore the Civil War is fascinated by tracing the hitherto unknown\r\nstretches north and south from the centre which he knew. The map\r\nbears testimony not only to the wide-spread practice of aiding\r\nfugitives, but to the devotion of the conductors on the Underground\r\nRailroad. How useful a section of Mr. Siebert's map would have been\r\nto the slave-catcher in the 50's, when so many strange negroes were\r\nappearing and disappearing in the free states! The facts presented\r\nin the brief compass of the map would have been of immense value\r\nalso to the leaders of the Southern Confederacy in 1861, as a\r\nconfirmation of their argument that the North would not perform its\r\nconstitutional duty of returning the fugitives; yet there is no\r\nrecord in this book of the betraying of the secrets of the U. G. R.\r\nR. by any person in the service. The moral bond of opposition to the\r\nwhole slave power kept men at work forwarding fugitives by a road\r\nof which they themselves knew but a small portion. The political\r\nphilosophers who think that the Civil War might have been averted by\r\ntimely concessions would do well to study this picture of the wide\r\ndistribution of persons who saw no peace in slavery.\r\n\r\nAmid all the varieties of anti-slavery men, from the Garrisonian\r\nabolitionist to faint-hearted slaveholders like James G. Birney,\r\nit is interesting to see how many had a share in the Underground\r\nRailroad; and how many earned a reputation as heroes. Professor\r\nSiebert has gathered the names of about 3,200 persons known to\r\nhave been engaged in this work--a roll of honor for many American\r\nfamilies. Everybody knew that the fugitives were aided by Fred\r\nDouglass, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Gerrit Smith, Joshua Giddings,\r\nJohn Brown, Levi Coffin, Thomas Garrett and Theodore Parker; but\r\nthis book gives us some account of the interest of men like Thaddeus\r\nStevens, not commonly counted among the sons of the prophets; and\r\nperforms a special service to the student of history and the lover\r\nof heroic deeds, by the brief account of the services of obscure\r\npersons who deserve a place in the hearts of their countrymen. Men\r\nlike Rev. George Bourne, Rev. James Duncan and Rev. John Rankin,\r\nyears before Garrison's propaganda, had begun to speak and publish\r\nagainst slavery, and to prepare men's minds for a righteous\r\ndisregard of Fugitive Slave Acts. Joseph Sider, with his carefully\r\nsubdivided peddler's wagon, deserves a place alongside the better\r\nknown Henry Box Brown. The thirty-five thousand stripes of Calvin\r\nFairbank, seventeen years a convict in the Kentucky penitentiary,\r\nrange him with Lovejoy as an anti-slavery martyr. Rev. Charles\r\nTorrey had in the work of rousing slaves to escape, the same\r\ndevotion to a fatal duty as that which animated John Brown. And no\r\none who has ever heard Harriet Tubman describe her part as \"Moses\"\r\nof the fugitives can ever forget that African prophetess, whose\r\nintense vigor is relieved by a shrewd and kindly humanity.\r\n\r\nThe quiet recital of the facts has all the charm of romance to\r\nthe passengers on the Underground Railroad: whether travelling\r\nby night in a procession of covered wagons, or boldly by day in\r\ndisguises; whether boxed up as so much freight, or riding on passes\r\nunhesitatingly given by abolitionist directors of railroads; the\r\nfugitives in these pages rejoice in their prospect of liberty. The\r\nroad sign near Oberlin, of a tiger chasing a negro, was a white\r\nman's joke; but it was a negro who said, apropos of his master's\r\ndiscouraging account of Canada: \"They put some extract onto it to\r\nkeep us from comin'\"; and neither Whittier in his poems, nor Harriet\r\nBeecher Stowe in her novels, imagined a more picturesque incident\r\nthan the crossing of the Detroit River by Fairfield's \"gang\" of\r\ntwenty-eight rescued souls singing, \"I'm on my way to Canada, where\r\ncolored men are free,\" to the joyful accompaniment of their firearms.\r\n\r\nTo the settlements of fugitives in Canada Professor Siebert has\r\ngiven more labor than appears in his book; for his own visits\r\nsupplement the accounts of earlier investigators; and we have here\r\nthe first complete account of the reception of the negroes in Canada\r\nand their progress in civilization.\r\n\r\nUpon the general question of the political effects of the\r\nUnderground Railroad, the book adds much to our information, by its\r\ndiscussion of the probable numbers of fugitives, and of the alarm\r\ncaused in the slave states by their departure. The census figures\r\nof 1850 and 1860 are shown to be wilfully false; and the escape\r\nof thousands of persons seems established beyond cavil. Into the\r\nconstitutional question of the right to take fugitives, the book\r\ngoes with less minuteness, since it is intended to be a contribution\r\nto knowledge, and not an addition to the abundant literature on the\r\nlegal side of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt has been the effort of Professor Siebert to furnish the means for\r\nsettling the following questions: the origin of the system of aid to\r\nthe fugitives, popularly called the Underground Railroad; the degree\r\nof formal organization; methods of procedure; geographical extent\r\nand relations; the leaders and heroes of the movement; the behavior\r\nof the fugitives on their way; the effectiveness of the settlement\r\nin Canada; the numbers of fugitives; and the attitude of courts and\r\ncommunities. On all these questions he furnishes new light; and he\r\nappears to prove his concluding statement that \"the Underground\r\nRailroad was one of the greatest forces which brought on the Civil\r\nWar and thus destroyed slavery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  SOURCES OF THE HISTORY OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD\r\n\r\n

The search for\r\nmaterials was carried on at intervals during several years until the\r\nmass of information, written and printed, was deemed sufficient to\r\nbe subjected to the processes of analysis and generalization.\r\n\r\nPatience and care have been required to overcome the difficulties\r\nattaching to a subject that was in an extraordinary sense a hidden\r\none; and the author has constantly tried to observe those well-known\r\ndicta of the historian; namely, to be content with the materials\r\ndiscovered without making additions of his own, and to let his\r\nconclusions be defined by the facts, rather than seek to cast these\r\n\"in the mould of his hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\nStarting without preconceptions, the writer has been constrained\r\nto the views set forth in Chapters X and XI in regard to the real\r\nmeaning and importance of the underground movement. And if it be\r\nfound by the reader that these views are in any measure novel, it is\r\nhoped that the pages of this book contain evidence sufficient for\r\ntheir justification. There is something mysterious and inexplicable\r\nabout the whole anti-slavery movement in the United States, as its\r\nhistory is generally recounted. According to the accepted view the\r\nanti-slavery movement of the thirties and the later decades has been\r\nconsidered as altogether distinct from the earlier abolition period\r\nin our history, both in principle and external features, and as\r\nseparated from it by a considerable interval of time. The earlier\r\nmovement is supposed to have died a natural death, and the later to\r\nhave sprung into full life and vigor with the appearance of Garrison\r\nand the _Liberator_. Issue is made with this view in the following\r\npages, where Macaulay's rational account of revolutions in general\r\nmay, perhaps, be thought to find illustration. Macaulay says in\r\none of his essays: \"As the history of states is generally written,\r\nthe greatest and most momentous revolutions seem to come upon them\r\nlike supernatural inflictions, without warning or cause. But the\r\nfact is, that such revolutions are almost always the consequences\r\nof moral changes, which have gradually passed on the mass of the\r\ncommunity, and which ordinarily proceed far before their progress\r\nis indicated by any public measure. An intimate knowledge of the\r\ndomestic history of nations is therefore absolutely necessary to the\r\nprognosis of political events.\" Or, the essayist might have added,\r\nto a subsequent understanding of them.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the author to make acknowledgments to all who\r\nhave contributed, directly and indirectly, to the promotion of\r\nhis research. A liberal use of foot-notes suffices to reduce his\r\nobligations in part only. But, although the great balance of his\r\nindebtedness must stand against him, his special acknowledgments\r\nare due in certain quarters. The writer has to thank Professor J.\r\nFranklin Jameson of Brown University for calling his attention to\r\na rare and important little book, which otherwise would almost\r\ncertainly have escaped his notice. To Professor Eugene Wambaugh of\r\nthe Harvard Law School he is indebted for the critical perusal of\r\nChapter IX, on the Prosecutions of Underground Railroad Men,--a\r\nchapter based largely on reports of cases, and involving legal\r\npoints about which the layman may easily go astray. The frequent\r\ncitations of the monograph on _Fugitive Slaves_ by Mrs. Marion\r\nG. McDougall attest the general usefulness of that book in the\r\npreparation of the present work. For personal encouragement in\r\nthe undertaking after the collection of materials had begun, and\r\nfor assistance while the study was being put in manuscript, the\r\nauthor is most deeply indebted to Professor Albert Bushnell Hart,\r\nand the Seminary of American History in Harvard University, over\r\nwhich he and his colleague, Professor Edward Channing, preside. The\r\nproof-sheets of this book have been read by Mr. F. B. Sanborn, of\r\nConcord, Massachusetts, and, it is hardly necessary to add, have\r\nprofited thereby in a way that would have been impossible had they\r\npassed under the eye of one less widely acquainted with anti-slavery\r\ntimes and anti-slavery people. More than to all others the author's\r\ngratitude is due to the members of his own household, without whose\r\nabiding interest and ready assistance in many ways this work could\r\nnot have been carried to completion. It should be said that no\r\nresponsibility for the use made of data or the conclusions drawn\r\nfrom them can justly be imposed upon those whose generous offices\r\nhave kept these pages freer from discrepancies than they could have\r\nbeen otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt is a fortunate circumstance that, by the kindness of the artist,\r\nMr. C. T. Webber, the reproduction of his painting entitled \"The\r\nUnderground Railroad\" can appear as the frontispiece of this book.\r\nMr. Webber was fitted by his intimate acquaintance with the Coffin\r\nfamily of Cincinnati, Ohio, and their remarkable record in the work\r\nof secret emancipation, to give a sympathetic delineation of the\r\nUnderground Railroad in operation.\r\n\r\n  OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,\r\n  October, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nUNDERGROUND RAILROAD\r\n\r\nFROM\r\n\r\nSLAVERY TO FREEDOM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF THE HISTORY OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorians who deal with the rise and culmination of the\r\nanti-slavery movement in the United States have comparatively little\r\nto say of one phase of it that cannot be neglected if the movement\r\nis to be fully understood. This is the so-called Underground\r\nRailroad, which, during fifty years or more, was secretly engaged\r\nin helping fugitive slaves to reach places of security in the free\r\nstates and in Canada. Henry Wilson speaks of the romantic interest\r\nattaching to the subject, and illustrates the coöperative efforts\r\nmade by abolitionists in behalf of colored refugees in two short\r\nchapters of the second volume of his _Rise and Fall of the Slave\r\nPower in America_.[1] Von Holst makes several references to the\r\nwork of the Road in his well-known _History of the United States_,\r\nand predicts that \"The time will yet come, even in the South, when\r\ndue recognition will be given to the touching unselfishness, simple\r\nmagnanimity and glowing love of freedom of these law-breakers on\r\nprinciple, who were for the most part people without name, money, or\r\nhigher education.\"[2] Rhodes in his great work, the _History of the\r\nUnited States from the Compromise of 1850_, mentions the system,\r\nbut considers it only as a manifestation of popular sentiment.[3]\r\nOther writers give less space to an account of this enterprise,\r\nalthough it was one that extended throughout many Northern states,\r\nand in itself supplied the reason for the enactment of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law of 1850, one of the most remarkable measures issuing from\r\nCongress during the whole anti-slavery struggle.\r\n\r\n  [1] Chapters VI and VII, pp. 61-86.\r\n\r\n  [2] Vol. III, p. 552, foot-note.\r\n\r\n  [3] _History of the United States_, Vol. II, pp. 74-77, 361, 362.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the failure to give to this \"institution\" the\r\nprominence which it deserves, is to be found in the secrecy in which\r\nit was enshrouded. Continuous through a period of two generations,\r\nthe Road spread to be a great system by being kept in an oblivion\r\nthat its operators aptly designated by the figurative use of the\r\nword \"underground.\" Then, too, it was a movement in which but few\r\nof those persons were involved whose names have been most closely\r\nassociated in history with the public agitation of the question of\r\nslavery, or with those political developments that resulted in the\r\ndestruction of slavery. In general the participants in underground\r\noperations were quiet persons, little known outside of the\r\nlocalities where they lived, and were therefore members of a class\r\nthat historians find it exceedingly difficult to bring within their\r\nfield of view.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to prepare a new account of the Underground\r\nRailroad, from new materials, something should be said of previous\r\nworks upon it, and especially of the seven books which deal\r\nspecifically with the subject: _The Underground Railroad_, by the\r\nRev. W. M. Mitchell; _Underground Railroad Records_, by William\r\nStill; _The Underground Railroad in Chester and the Neighboring\r\nCounties of Pennsylvania_, by R. C. Smedley; _The Reminiscences of\r\nLevi Coffin_; _Sketches in the History of the Underground Railroad_,\r\nby Eber M. Pettit; _From Dixie to Canada_, by H. U. Johnson; and\r\n_Heroes in Homespun_, by Ascott R. Hope (a _nom de plume_ for Robert\r\nHope Moncrieff).\r\n\r\nWhile several of these volumes are sources of original material,\r\ntheir value is chiefly that of collections of incidents, affording\r\none an insight into the workings of the Underground Railroad in\r\ncertain localities, and presenting types of character among the\r\nhelpers and the helped. In composition they are what one would\r\nexpect of persons who lived simple, strenuous lives, who with\r\nsincerity record what they knew and experienced. They have not only\r\nthe characteristics of a deep-seated, moral movement, they have also\r\nan undeniable value for historical purposes.\r\n\r\nMitchell's small volume of 172 pages was published in England in\r\n1860. Its author was a free negro, who served as a slave-driver in\r\nthe South for several years, then became a preacher in Ohio, and\r\nfor twelve years engaged in underground work; finally, about 1855,\r\nhe went to Toronto, Canada, to minister to colored refugees as a\r\nmissionary in the service of the American Free Baptist Mission\r\nSociety.[4] It was while soliciting money in England for the purpose\r\nof building a chapel and schoolhouse for his people in Toronto\r\nthat he was induced to write his book. The range of experience\r\nof the author enabled him to relate at first hand many incidents\r\nillustrative of the various phases of underground procedure, and to\r\ngive an account of the condition of the fugitive slaves in Canada.[5]\r\n\r\n  [4] Mitchell, _Underground Railroad_, Preface, p. vi; p. 17.\r\n\r\n  [5] Mr. Mitchell divides his little book into two chapters, one\r\n  on the \"Underground Railroad,\" occupying 124 pages, the other on\r\n  the \"Condition of Fugitive Slaves in Canada,\" occupying 48 pages.\r\n\r\nStill's _Underground Railroad Records_, a large volume of 780\r\npages, appeared in 1872, and a second edition in 1883. For some\r\nyears before the War Mr. Still was a clerk in the office of the\r\nPennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia; and from 1852\r\nto 1860 he served as chairman of the Acting Vigilance Committee\r\nof Philadelphia, a body whose special business it was to harbor\r\nfugitives and help them towards Canada. About 1850 Mr. Still began\r\nto keep records of the stories he heard from runaways, and his\r\nbook is mainly a compilation of these stories, together with some\r\nUnderground Railroad correspondence. At the end there are some\r\nbiographical sketches of persons more or less prominent in the\r\nanti-slavery cause. The book is a mine of material relating to the\r\nwork of the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOperations carried on in an extended field of six or seven counties\r\nin southeastern Pennsylvania, over routes many of which led to\r\nthe Quaker City, are recounted in Smedley's volume of 395 pages,\r\npublished in 1883. The abundant reminiscences and short biographies\r\nwere patiently gathered by the author from many aged participants in\r\nunderground enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn his _Reminiscences_, a book of 732 pages, Levi Coffin, the\r\nreputed president of the Underground Railroad, relates his\r\nexperiences from the time when he began, as a youth in North\r\nCarolina, to direct slaves northward on the path to liberty, till\r\nthe time when, after twenty years of service in eastern Indiana and\r\nfifteen in Cincinnati, Ohio, he and his coworkers were relieved by\r\nthe admission of slaves within the lines of the Union forces in the\r\nSouth. Mr. Coffin was a Quaker of the gentle but firm type depicted\r\nby Harriet Beecher Stowe in the character Simeon Halliday, of which\r\nhe may have been the original. It need scarcely be said, therefore,\r\nthat his autobiography is characterized by simplicity and candor,\r\nand supplies a fund of information in regard to those branches of\r\nthe Road with which its author was connected.\r\n\r\nPettit's _Sketches_ comprise a series of articles printed in the\r\nFredonia (New York) _Censor_, during the fall of 1868, and collected\r\nin 1879 into a book of 174 pages. The author was for many years a\r\n\"conductor\" in southwestern New York, and most of the adventures\r\nnarrated occurred within his personal knowledge.\r\n\r\nJohnson's _From Dixie to Canada_ is a little volume of 194 pages,\r\nin which are reprinted some of the many stories first published\r\nby him in the _Lake Shore Home Magazine_ during the years 1883 to\r\n1889 under the heading, \"Romances and Realities of the Underground\r\nRailroad.\" The data that most of these tales embody were accumulated\r\nby research, and while the names of operators, towns and so forth\r\nare authentic, the writer allows himself the license of the\r\nstory-teller instead of restricting himself to the simple recording\r\nof the information secured. His investigations have given him an\r\nacquaintance with the routes of northeastern Ohio and the adjacent\r\nportions of Pennsylvania and New York.\r\n\r\nHope's volume, published in 1894, does not increase the number\r\nof our sources of information, inasmuch as its materials are\r\nderived from Still's _Underground Railroad Records_ and Coffin's\r\n_Reminiscences_. It was written by an Englishman apparently as a\r\npopular exposition of the hidden methods of the abolitionists.\r\n\r\nTo these books should be added a pamphlet of thirty pages,\r\nentitled _The Underground Railroad_, by James H. Fairchild, D.D.,\r\nex-President of Oberlin College, published in 1895 by the Western\r\nReserve Historical Society.[6] The author had personal knowledge\r\nof many of the events he narrates and recounts several underground\r\ncases of notoriety; he thus affords a clear insight into the\r\nconditions under which secret aid came to be rendered to runaways.\r\n\r\n  [6] _Tract No. 87_, in Vol. IV, pp. 91-121, of the publications\r\n  of the Society.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that a subject, the mysterious and romantic\r\ncharacter of which might be supposed to appeal to a wide circle\r\nof readers, has not been duly treated in any of the modern\r\npopular magazines. During the last ten years a few articles\r\nabout the Underground Railroad have appeared in _The Magazine of\r\nWestern History_,[7] _The Firelands Pioneer_,[8] _The Midland\r\nMonthly_,[9] _The Canadian Magazine of Politics, Science, Art and\r\nLiterature_[10] and _The American Historical Review_.[11] Three of\r\nthese publications, the first two and the last, are of a special\r\ncharacter; the other two, although they appeal to the general\r\nreader, cannot be said to have attempted more than the presentation\r\nof a few incidents out of the experience of certain underground\r\nhelpers. From time to time the _New England Magazine_ has given its\r\nreaders glimpses of the Underground Road by its articles dealing\r\nwith several well-known fugitive slave cases, and a biographical\r\nsketch of the abductor Harriet Tubman.[12] But it would be quite\r\nimpossible for any one to gain an adequate idea of the movement from\r\nthe meagre accounts that have appeared in any of these magazines.\r\n\r\n  [7] March, 1887, pp. 672-682.\r\n\r\n  [8] July, 1888, pp. 19-88. This periodical is issued by\r\n  the Firelands Historical Society of Ohio. The bulk of the\r\n  number mentioned is made up of contributions in regard to the\r\n  Underground Road in northwestern Ohio.\r\n\r\n  [9] February, 1895, pp. 173-180.\r\n\r\n  [10] May, 1895, pp. 9-16.\r\n\r\n  [11] April, 1896, pp. 455-463. This article is a preliminary\r\n  study prepared by the author.\r\n\r\n  [12] Lillie B. C.

Without undertaking here to print a full\r\nlist of articles on the subject, it is worth while to notice a few\r\nnewspapers in which series of sketches have appeared of more or less\r\nvalue in extending our geographical knowledge of the system, or in\r\nillustrating some important phase of its working. The New Lexington\r\n(Ohio) _Tribune_, from October, 1885, to February, 1886, contains a\r\nseries of reminiscences, written by Mr. Thomas L. Gray, that supply\r\ninteresting information about the work in southeastern Ohio. The\r\nPontiac (Illinois) _Sentinel_, in 1890 and 1891, published fifteen\r\nchapters of \"A History of Anti-Slavery Days\" contributed by Mr. W.\r\nB. Fyffe, recording some episodes in the development of this Road\r\nin northeastern Illinois. The _Sentinel_, of Mt. Gilead, Ohio, in\r\na series of articles, one of which appeared every week from July\r\n13 to August 17, 1893, under the name of Aaron Benedict, affords\r\na knowledge of the way in which the secret work was carried on in\r\na typical Quaker community. In _The Republican Leader_, of Salem,\r\nIndiana, at various dates from Nov. 17, 1893, to April, 1894, E.\r\nHicks Trueblood printed the results of some investigations begun\r\nat the instance of the author, which disclose the principal routes\r\nof south central Indiana. An account of the peculiar methods of\r\nthe pedler Joseph Sider, an abductor of slaves, is also given by\r\nMr. Trueblood. The Rev. John Todd has preserved in the columns\r\nof the Tabor (Iowa) _Beacon_, in 1890 and 1891, some valuable\r\nreminiscences, running through more than twenty numbers of the\r\npaper, under the title, \"The Early Settlement and Growth of Western\r\nIowa\"; several of these are devoted to fugitive slave cases.[13]\r\n\r\n  [13] Other newspapers in which materials have been found are\r\n  mentioned in the Appendix, pp. 395-398.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, in view of the unlawful nature of\r\nUnderground Railroad service, that extremely little in the way of\r\ncontemporaneous documents has descended to us even across the short\r\nspan of a generation or two, and that there are few written data for\r\nthe history of a movement that gave liberty to thousands of slaves.\r\nThe legal restraints upon the rendering of aid to slaves bent on\r\nflight to Canada were, of course, ever present in the minds of\r\nthose that pitied the bondman, whether a well-informed lawyer, like\r\nJoshua R. Giddings, or an illiterate negro, who, notwithstanding his\r\nfellow-feeling, was yet sufficiently sagacious to avoid the open\r\nviolation of what others might call the law of the land. Therefore,\r\nwritten evidence of complicity was for the most part carefully\r\navoided; and little information concerning any part of the work of\r\nthe Underground Road was allowed to get into print. It is known that\r\nrecords and diaries were kept by certain helpers; and a few of the\r\nletters and messages that passed between station-keepers have been\r\npreserved. These sources of information are as valuable as they are\r\nrare: they would doubtless be more plentiful if the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw of 1850 had not created such consternation as to lead to the\r\ndestruction of most of the telltale documents.\r\n\r\nThe great collection of contemporaneous material is that of William\r\nStill, relating mainly to the work of the Vigilance Committee of\r\nPhiladelphia. The motives and the methods of Mr. Still in keeping\r\nhis register are given in the following words: \"Thousands of\r\nescapes, harrowing separations, dreadful longings, dark gropings\r\nafter lost parents, brothers, sisters, and identities, seemed ever\r\nto be pressing on my mind. While I knew the danger of keeping strict\r\nrecords, and while I did not then dream that in my day slavery would\r\nbe blotted out, or that the time would come when I could publish\r\nthese records, it used to afford me great satisfaction to take them\r\ndown fresh from the lips of fugitives on the way to freedom, and\r\nto preserve them as they had given them....\"[14] When in 1852 Mr.\r\nStill became the chairman of the Acting Committee of Vigilance his\r\nopportunities were doubtless increased for obtaining histories of\r\ncases; and he was then directed as head of the committee \"to keep a\r\nrecord of all their doings, ... especially of the money received and\r\nexpended on behalf of every case claiming their interposition.\"[15]\r\nDuring the period of the War, Chairman Still concealed the records\r\nand documents he had collected in the loft of Lebanon Cemetery\r\nbuilding, and although their publication became practicable when the\r\nProclamation of Emancipation was issued, the _Underground Railroad\r\nRecords_ did not appear until 1872.[16]\r\n\r\n  [14] _Underground Railroad Records_, pp. xxxiii, xxxiv.\r\n\r\n  [15] _Ibid._, p. 611, where is printed an article from the\r\n  _Pennsylvania Freeman_, December 9, 1852, giving an account of\r\n  the formation of the Committee.\r\n\r\n  [16] See pp. xxxiv, xxxv, xxxvi.\r\n\r\nTheodore Parker, the distinguished Unitarian clergyman of Boston,\r\nand one of the most active members of the Vigilance Committee\r\nof that city, kept memoranda of occurrences growing out of the\r\nattempted enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law in his neighborhood.\r\nHe was outspoken in his opposition to the law, and was not less bold\r\nin gathering into a journal, along with newspaper clippings and\r\nhandbills referring to the troubles of the time, manuscripts of his\r\nown bearing on the unlawful procedure of the Committee. This journal\r\nor scrap-book, given to the Boston Public Library in 1874 by Mrs.\r\nParker,[17] was compiled day by day from March 15, 1851, to February\r\n19, 1856, and throws much light on the rendition of the fugitives\r\nBurns and Sims.\r\n\r\n  [17] The title Mr. Parker gave to this scrap-book is as follows:\r\n  \"Memoranda of the Troubles in Boston occasioned by the infamous\r\n  Fugitive Slave Law.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Brown, of Osawattomie, left a few notes of his memorable\r\njourney through Kansas and Iowa, on his way to Canada in the winter\r\nof 1858 and 1859, with a company of slaves rescued by him from\r\nbondage in western Missouri. On the back of the original draft of\r\na letter written by Brown for the _New York Tribune_ soon after\r\nthe slaves had been taken from their masters, appear the names\r\nof station-keepers of the Underground Railroad in eastern Kansas,\r\nand a record of certain expenditures forming, doubtless, a part of\r\nthe cost of his trip.[18] When the fearless abductor arrived at\r\nSpringdale, Iowa, late in February, he wrote to a friend in Tabor a\r\nstatement concerning the \"Reception of Brown and Party at Grinnell,\r\nIowa, compared with Proceedings at Tabor,\" in which he set down in\r\nthe form of items the substantial attentions he had received at the\r\nhands of citizens of Grinnell.[19] These meagre records, together\r\nwith the letter written to the _Tribune_ mentioned above, are all\r\nthat Brown wrote, so far as known, giving explicit information in\r\nregard to an exploit that created a stir throughout the country.\r\n\r\n  [18] Sanborn, _Life and Letters of John Brown_, p. 482.\r\n\r\n  [19] _Ibid._, pp. 488, 489.\r\n\r\nMr. Jirch Platt, of the vicinity of Mendon, Illinois, recorded\r\nhis experiences as a station-keeper in a \"sort of diary and farm\r\nrecord,\" and in a \"blue-book,\" and appears to have been the only one\r\nof the underground helpers of Illinois that ventured to chronicle\r\nmatters of this kind. The diary is still extant, and shows entries\r\ncovering a period of more than ten years, closing with October,\r\n1859; the following items will illustrate sufficiently the character\r\nof the record:--\r\n\r\n\"_May 19, 1848._ Hannah Coger arrived on the U. G. Railroad, the\r\nlast $100.00 for freedom she was to pay to Thomas Anderson, Palmyra,\r\nMo.

Have understood also that\r\nthree others were ticketed about midsummer.\"\r\n\r\nIn Ohio, Daniel Osborn, of the Alum Creek Quaker Settlement, in\r\nthe central part of the state, kept a diary, of which to-day only\r\na leaf remains. This bit of paper gives a record of the number\r\nof negroes passing through the Alum Creek neighborhood during an\r\ninterval of five months, from April 14 to September 10, 1844,\r\nand is of considerable importance, because it supplies data that\r\nfurnish, when taken in connection with other terms, the elements\r\nfor an interesting computation of the number of slaves that escaped\r\ninto Ohio.[20] In the correspondence of Mr. David Putnam, of Point\r\nHamar, near Marietta, Ohio, there were found a few letters relating\r\nto the journeys of fugitives. That even these few letters remain is\r\ndoubtless due to neglect or oversight on the part of the recipient.\r\nIt is noticeable that some of them bear unmistakable signs of\r\nintended secrecy, the proper names having been blotted out, or\r\ncovered with bits of paper.\r\n\r\n  [20] See Chap. XI, p. 346.\r\n\r\nUnderground managers who were so indiscreet as to keep a diary or\r\nletters for a season, were induced to part with such condemning\r\nevidence under the stress of a special danger. Mr. Robert Purvis,\r\nof Philadelphia, states that he kept a record of the fugitives\r\nthat passed through his hands and those of his coworkers in the\r\nQuaker City for a long period, till the trepidation of his family\r\nafter the passage of the Fugitive Slave Bill in 1850 caused him to\r\ndestroy it.[21] Daniel Gibbons, a Friend, who lived near Columbia\r\nin southeastern Pennsylvania, began in 1824 to keep a record of the\r\nnumber of fugitives he aided. He was in the habit of entering in his\r\nbook the name of the master of each fugitive, the fugitive's own\r\nname and his age, and the new name given him. The data thus gathered\r\ncame in time to form a large volume, but after the passage of the\r\nFugitive Slave Law Mr. Gibbons burned this book.[22] William Parker,\r\nthe colored leader in the famous Christiana case, was found by a\r\nfriend to have a large number of letters from escaped slaves hidden\r\nabout his house at the time of the Christiana affair, September\r\n11, 1851, and these fateful documents were quickly destroyed. Had\r\nthey been discovered by the officers that visited Parker's house,\r\nthey might have brought disaster upon many persons.[23] Thus,\r\nthe need of secrecy constantly served to prevent the making of\r\nrecords, or to bring about their early destruction. The written and\r\nprinted records do give a multitude of unquestioned facts about the\r\nUnderground Railroad; but when wishing to find out the details of\r\nrational management, the methods of business, and the total amount\r\nof traffic, we are thrown back on the recollections of living\r\nabolitionists as the main source of information; from them the gaps\r\nin the real history of the Underground Railroad must be filled, if\r\nfilled at all.\r\n\r\n  [21] Conversation with Robert Purvis, Philadelphia, Pa., December\r\n  24, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [22] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, pp. 56, 57.\r\n\r\n  [23] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, pp. 120, 121.\r\n\r\nIt is with the aid of such memorials that the present volume has\r\nbeen written. Reminiscences have been gathered by correspondence\r\nand by travel from many surviving abolitionists or their families;\r\nand recollections of fugitive slave days have been culled from\r\nbooks, newspapers, letters and diaries. During three years of the\r\nfive years of preparation the author's residence in Ohio afforded\r\nhim opportunity to visit many places in that state where former\r\nemployees of the Underground Railroad could be found, and to extend\r\nthese explorations to southern Michigan, and among the surviving\r\nfugitives along the Detroit River in the Province of Ontario.\r\nResidence in Massachusetts during the years 1895-1897 has enabled\r\nhim to secure some interesting information in regard to underground\r\nlines in New England. The materials thus collected relate to\r\nthe following states: Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,\r\nMichigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, New\r\nHampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont, besides a few\r\nitems concerning North Carolina, Maryland and Delaware.\r\n\r\nUnderground operations practically ceased with the beginning of the\r\nCivil War. In view of the lapse of time, the reasons for trusting\r\nthe credibility of the evidence upon which our knowledge of the\r\nUnderground Road rests should be stated. Some of the testimony\r\ndealt with in this chapter was put in writing during the period\r\nof the Road's operation, or at the close of its activity, and,\r\ntherefore, cannot be easily questioned. But it may be said that\r\na large part of the materials for this history were drawn from\r\nwritten and oral accounts obtained at a much later date; and that\r\nthese materials, even though the honesty and fidelity of the\r\nnarrators be granted, are worthy of little credit for historical\r\npurposes. Such a criticism would doubtless be just as applied to\r\nreminiscences purporting to represent particular events with great\r\ndetail of narration, but clearly it would lose much of its force\r\nwhen directed against recollections of occurrences that came within\r\nthe range of the narrator's experience, not once nor twice, but\r\nmany times with little variation in their main features. It would\r\nbe difficult to imagine an \"old-time\" abolitionist, whose faculties\r\nare in a fair state of preservation, forgetting that he received\r\nfugitives from a certain neighbor or community a few miles away,\r\nthat he usually stowed them in his garret or his haymow, and that\r\nhe was in the habit of taking them at night in all kinds of weather\r\nto one of several different stations, the managers of which he knew\r\nintimately and trusted implicitly. Not only did repetition serve to\r\ndeepen the general recollections of the average operator, but the\r\nstrange and romantic character of his unlawful business helped to\r\nfix them in his mind. Some special occurrences he is apt to remember\r\nwith vividness, because they were in some way extraordinary. If it\r\nbe argued that the surviving abolitionists are now old persons, it\r\nshould not be forgotten that it is a fact of common observation that\r\nold persons ordinarily remember the occurrences of their youth and\r\nprime better than events of recent date. The abolitionists, as a\r\nclass, were people whose remembrances of the ante-bellum days were\r\ndeepened by the clear definition of their governing principles, the\r\nabiding sense of their religious convictions, and the extraordinary\r\nconditions, legal and social, under which their acts were performed.\r\nThe risks these persons ran, the few and scattered friends they had,\r\nthe concentration of their interests into small compass, because\r\nof the disdain of the communities where they lived, have secured\r\nto us a source of knowledge, the value of which cannot be lightly\r\nquestioned. If there be doubt on this point, it must give way before\r\nthe manner in which statements gathered from different localities\r\nduring the last five years articulate together, the testimony of\r\ndifferent and sometimes widely separated witnesses combining to\r\nsupport one another.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] The value of reminiscences and memoirs is considered in\r\n  an article on \"Recollections as a Source of History,\" by the\r\n  Hon. Edward L. Pierce, in the _Proceedings of the Massachusetts\r\n  Historical Society_, March and April, 1896, pp. 473-490. This,\r\n  with the remarks of Professor H. Morse Stephens in his article\r\n  entitled \"Recent Memoirs of the French Directory,\" _American\r\n  Historical Review_, April, 1896, pp. 475, 476, 489, should\r\n  be read as a corrective by the student that finds himself\r\n  constrained to have recourse to recollections for information.\r\n\r\nThe elucidation by new light of some obscure matter already\r\nreported, the verification by a fresh witness of some fact already\r\ndiscovered, gives at once the rule and test of an investigation\r\nsuch as this. Out of many illustrations that might be given, the\r\nfollowing are offered. Mr. J. M. Forsyth, of Northwood, Logan\r\nCounty, Ohio, writes under date September 22, 1894: \"In Northwood\r\nthere is a denomination known as Covenanters; among them the\r\nrunaways were safe. Isaac Patterson has a cave on his place where\r\nthe fugitives were secreted and fed two or three weeks at a time\r\nuntil the hunt for them was over. Then friends, as hunters, in\r\ncovered wagons would take them to Sandusky. The highest number taken\r\nat one time was seven. The conductors were mostly students from\r\nNorthwood. All I did was to help get up the team....\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. S. T. Milligan, of Esther, Pennsylvania, December 5,\r\n1896, writes entirely independently: \"In 1849 my brother ... and\r\nI went ... to Logan Co., Ohio, to conduct a grammar school ...\r\nat a place called Northwood. The school developed into a college\r\nunder the title of Geneva Hall. J. R. W. Sloane[25] ... was elected\r\nPresident and moved to Northwood in 1851.... The region was settled\r\nby Covenanters and Seceders, and every house was a home for the\r\nwanderers. But there was a cave on the farm of a man by the name of\r\nPatterson, absolutely safe and fairly comfortable for fugitives.\r\nIn one instance thirteen fugitives, after resting in the cave for\r\nsome days, were taken by the students in two covered wagons to\r\nSandusky, some 90 miles, where I had gone to engage passage for them\r\non the Bay City steamboat across the lake to Malden--where I saw\r\nthem safely landed on free soil, to their unspeakable joy. Indeed, I\r\nthought one old man would have died from the gladness of his heart\r\nin being safe in freedom. I went from Belle Centre [near Northwood]\r\nby rail, and did not go with the land escort--but from what they\r\ntold me of their experience, it was often amusing and sometimes\r\nthrilling. They were ostensibly a hunting party of 10 or 12 armed\r\nmen.... The two covered wagons were a 'sanctum sanctorum' into which\r\nno mortal was allowed to peep.... The word of command, 'Stand back,'\r\nwas always respected by those who were unduly intent upon seeing\r\nthe thirteen deer ... brought from the woods of Logan and Hardin\r\ncounties and being taken to Sandusky.\"\r\n\r\n  [25] The Rev. J. R. W. Sloane, D.D., was the father of Professor\r\n  William M. Sloane, of Columbia University, New York City.\r\n  Professor Sloane, in a letter recently received, says: \"The first\r\n  clear, conscious memory I have is of seeing slaves taken from\r\n  our garret near midnight, and forwarded towards Sandusky. I also\r\n  remember the formal, but rather friendly, visitation of the house\r\n  by the sheriff's posse.\" Date of letter, Paris, November 19, 1896.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter Mr. Milligan corroborates some information\r\nsecured from the Rev. R. G. Ramsey, of Cadiz, Ohio, August 18, 1892,\r\nin regard to an underground route in southern Illinois. Mr. Ramsey\r\nrelated that his father, Robert Ramsey, first engaged in Underground\r\nRailroad work at Eden, Randolph County, Illinois, in 1844, and\r\nthat he carried it on at intervals until the War. \"The fugitives,\"\r\nhe said, \"came up the river to Chester, Illinois, and there they\r\nstarted northeast on the state road, which followed an old Indian\r\ntrail. The stations were each in a community of Covenanters, ...\"\r\nand existed, according to his account, at Chester, Eden, Oakdale,\r\nNashville and Centralia. \"Besides my father,\" said Mr. Ramsey,\r\n\"John Hood and two brothers, James B. and Thomas McClurkin, lived\r\nin Oakdale, where my father lived during the last thirty-five years\r\nof his life. He lived in Eden before this time....\"[26] The Rev.\r\nMr. Milligan writes as follows: \"My father removed to Randolph Co.,\r\nIll., in 1847, and with Rev. Wm. Sloane ... and the Covenanter\r\ncongregations under their ministry kept a very large depot wide\r\nopen for slaves escaping from Missouri. Scores at a time came to\r\nSparta [the post-office of the Eden settlement mentioned above]--my\r\nfather's region, were harbored there, ... and finally escorted to\r\nElkhorn [about two miles from Oakdale], the region of Father Sloane,\r\nwhere they were sheltered and escorted ... to some friends in the\r\nregion of Nashville, Ill., and thence north on the regular trail\r\nwhich I am not able further to locate. At Sparta, Coultersville and\r\nElkhorn there was an almost constant supply of fugitives.... But ...\r\nfew were ever gotten from the ægis of the Hayes and Moores and Todds\r\nand McLurkins and Hoods and Sloanes and Milligans of that region.\"\r\n\r\n  [26] Conversation with the Rev. R. G. Ramsey, Cadiz, Ohio, August\r\n  18, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe evidence above quoted has the well-known value of two witnesses,\r\nexamined apart, who corroborate each other; and it also illustrates\r\nthe way in which the pieces of underground routes may be joined\r\ntogether. These letters, together with some additional testimony,\r\nenable us to trace on the map a section of a secret line of travel\r\nin southern Illinois.\r\n\r\nAnother example throws light on a channel of escape in northeastern\r\nIndiana. While Levi Coffin lived at Newport (now Fountain City),\r\nIndiana, he sometimes sent slaves northward by way of what he\r\ncalled \"the Mississinewa route,\"[27] from the Mississinewa River,\r\nnear which undoubtedly it ran for a considerable distance. This\r\nroad seems to have been called also the Grant County route. In the\r\nmost general way only do these descriptions tell anything about\r\nthe route. However, correspondence with several people of Indiana\r\nhas brought it to light. One letter[28] informs us in regard to\r\nfugitives departing from Newport: \"If they came to Economy they\r\nwere sent to Grant Co....\" Now, so far as known, Jonesboro' was the\r\nnext locality to which they were usually forwarded, and the line\r\nfrom this point northward is given us by the Hon. John Ratliff,\r\nof Marion, Indiana, who had been over it with passengers. He says\r\nthat the first station north of Jonesboro' was North Manchester,\r\nwhere \"Morris\" Place was agent; the next station, Goshen, where\r\nDr. Matchett harbored fugitives; and thence the line ran to Young's\r\nPrairie,[29] which is in Cass County, Michigan. The same section of\r\nRoad, but with a few additional stations, is marked out by William\r\nHayward. The additional stations may not have existed at the time\r\nwhen Mr. Ratliff served as a guide, or he may have forgotten to\r\nmention them. Mr. Hayward writes: \"My cousin, Maurice Place, often\r\nbrought carriage loads of colored people from North Manchester,\r\nWabash Co., to my father's house, six miles west of Manchester on\r\nthe Rochester road.... We would keep them ... until sometime in the\r\nnight; then my father would go with them to Avery Brace's ... three\r\nmiles ... north, through the woods. He took them ... seven miles\r\nfarther ... to Chauncey Hurlburt's in Kosciusko Co.... They (the\r\nHurlburts) took them twelve miles farther ... to Warsaw, to a man by\r\nthe name of Gordon, and he took them to Dr. Matchett's in Elkhart\r\nCo., not far from Goshen. There were friends there to help them to\r\nMichigan.\"[30]\r\n\r\n  [27] _Reminiscences_, p. 184.\r\n\r\n  [28] Letter of John Charles, Economy, Wayne County, Indiana,\r\n  January 9, 1896.

Mr. Osborn obtained the names of stations in conversation\r\n  with Mr. Ratliff.\r\n\r\n  [30] Letter of William Hayward.\r\n\r\nIn weighing the testimony amassed, the author has had the advantage\r\nof personal acquaintance with many of those furnishing information;\r\nand the internal evidence of letters has been considered in\r\nestimating the worth of written testimony. Doubtless the work could\r\nhave been more thoroughly executed, if the collection of materials\r\nhad been systematically undertaken by some one a decade or two\r\nearlier. It is certain that it could not have been postponed to a\r\nlater period. Since the inception of this research the ravages of\r\ntime have greatly thinned the company of witnesses, who count it\r\namong their chiefest joys that they were permitted to live to see\r\ntheir country rid of slavery, and the negro race a free people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE PIONEERS IN THE UNDERGROUND MOVEMENT IN\r\nPHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopper is supposed to have resorted to underground methods as\r\nearly as 1787.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND GROWTH OF THE UNDERGROUND ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Underground Road developed in a section of country rid of\r\nslavery, and situated between two regions, from one of which slaves\r\nwere continually escaping with the prospect of becoming indisputably\r\nfree on crossing the borders of the other. Not a few persons living\r\nwithin the intervening territory were deeply opposed to slavery,\r\nand although they were bound by law to discountenance slaves\r\nseeking freedom, they felt themselves to be more strongly bound by\r\nconscience to give them help. Thus it happened that in the course of\r\nthe sixty years before the outbreak of the War of the Rebellion the\r\nNorthern states became traversed by numerous secret pathways leading\r\nfrom Southern bondage to Canadian liberty.\r\n\r\nSlavery was put in process of extinction at an early period in\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and the New England states. From\r\nthe five and a fraction states created out of the Northwestern\r\nTerritory slavery was excluded by the Ordinance of 1787. It is\r\ninteresting to note how rapid was the progress of emancipation in\r\nthe Northeastern states, where the conditions of climate, industry\r\nand public opinion were unfavorable to the continuance of slavery.\r\nIn 1777 emancipation was begun by the action of Vermont, which upon\r\nits separation from New York adopted a constitution in which slavery\r\nwas prohibited. Pennsylvania and Massachusetts took action three\r\nyears later. Pennsylvania provided by statute for gradual abolition,\r\nand its example was followed by Rhode Island and Connecticut in\r\n1784, by New York in 1799, and by New Jersey in 1804. Massachusetts\r\nwas less direct, but not less effective, in securing the extinction\r\nof slavery; happily it had inserted in the declaration of rights\r\nprefixed to its constitution: \"All men are born free and equal, and\r\nhave certain natural, essential and inalienable rights.\"[31] This\r\nclause received at a later time strict interpretation at the bar of\r\nthe state supreme court, and slavery was held to have ceased with\r\nthe year 1780.\r\n\r\n  [31] Constitution of Massachusetts, Part I, Art. 1; quoted by Du\r\n  Bois, _Suppression of the Slave Trade_, p. 225.\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said about the remaining group of states with\r\nwhich we are here concerned. Their territorial organizations were\r\neffected under the provisions of the Ordinance of 1787. One of the\r\nmost important of these provisions is as follows: \"There shall be\r\nneither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said Territory,\r\notherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall\r\nhave been duly convicted.\"[32] It was this feature, introduced\r\ninto the great Ordinance by New England men, that rendered futile\r\nthe many attempts subsequently made by Indiana Territory to have\r\nslavery admitted within its own boundaries by congressional\r\nenactment. \"It is probable,\" says Rhodes, \"that had it not been for\r\nthe prohibitory clause, slavery would have gained such a foothold\r\nin Indiana and Illinois that the two would have been organized as\r\nslaveholding states.\"[33] The five states, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan and Wisconsin were therefore admitted to the Union as\r\nfree states. West of the Mississippi River there is one state, at\r\nleast, that must be added to the group just indicated, namely, Iowa.\r\nSlaveholding was prevented within its domain by the Act of Congress\r\nof 1820, prohibiting slavery in the territory acquired under the\r\nLouisiana purchase north of latitude 36° 30', and several years\r\nbefore this law was abrogated Iowa had entered statehood with a\r\nconstitution that fixed her place among the free commonwealths. The\r\nenfranchisement of this extended region was thus accomplished by\r\nstate and national action. The ominous result was the establishment\r\nof a sweeping line of frontier between the slaveholding South and\r\nthe non-slaveholding North, and thereby the propounding to the\r\nnation of a new question, that of the status of fugitives in\r\nfree regions. The elements were in the proper condition for the\r\ncrystallization of this question.\r\n\r\n  [32] See Appendix A, p. 359.\r\n\r\n  [33] _History of the United States_, Vol. I, p. 16.\r\n\r\nThe colonies generally had found it necessary to provide regulations\r\nin regard to fugitives and the restoration of them to their masters.\r\nSuch provisions, it is probable, were reasonably well observed as\r\nlong as runaways did not escape beyond the borders of the colonies\r\nto which their owners belonged; but escapes from the territory of\r\none colony into that of another were at first left to be settled\r\nas the state of feeling existing between the two peoples concerned\r\nshould dictate. In 1643 the New England Confederation of Plymouth,\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut and New Haven, unwilling to leave the\r\nsubject of the delivery of fugitives longer to intercolonial\r\ncomity, incorporated a clause in their Articles of Confederation\r\nproviding: \"If any servant runn away from his master into any\r\nother of these confederated Jurisdiccons, That in such case vpon\r\nthe Certyficate of one Majistrate in the Jurisdiccon out of which\r\nthe said servant fled, or upon other due proofs, the said servant\r\nshall be deliuered either to his Master or any other that pursues\r\nand brings such Certificate or proofe.\" About the same time an\r\nagreement was entered into between the Dutch at New Netherlands and\r\nthe English at New Haven for the mutual surrender of fugitives, a\r\nstep that was preceded by a complaint from the commissioners of the\r\nUnited Colonies to Governor Stuyvesant of New Netherlands, to the\r\neffect that the Dutch agent at Hartford was harboring one of their\r\nIndian slaves, and by the refusal to return some of Stuyvesant's\r\nrunaway servants from New Haven until the redress of the grievance.\r\nIt was only when some of the fugitives had been restored to New\r\nNetherlands, and a proclamation, issued in a spirit of retaliation\r\nby the Lords of the West India Company, forbidding the rendition\r\nof fugitive slaves to New Haven, had been annulled, that the\r\nagreement for the mutual surrender of runaways was made by the\r\ntwo parties. Negotiations in regard to fugitives early took place\r\nbetween Maryland and New Netherlands; at one time on account of the\r\nflight of some slaves from the Southern colony into the Northern\r\ncolony, and later on account of the reversal of the conditions.\r\nThe temper of the Dutch when calling for their servants in 1659\r\nwas not conciliatory, for they threatened, if their demand should\r\nbe refused, \"to publish free liberty, access and recess to all\r\nplanters, servants, negroes, fugitives, and runaways which may go\r\ninto New Netherland.\" The escape of fugitives from the Eastern\r\ncolonies northward to Canada was also a constant source of trouble\r\nbetween the French and the Dutch, and between the French and\r\nEnglish.[34]\r\n\r\n  [34] M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, pp. 2-11.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, emancipation acts were passed by Vermont and four\r\nother states the new question came into existence. It presented\r\nitself also in the Western territories. The framers of the\r\nNorthwest Ordinance found themselves confronted by the question,\r\nand they dealt with it in the spirit of compromise. They enacted a\r\nstipulation for the territory, \"that any person escaping into the\r\nsame, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one\r\nof the original states, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed\r\nand conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service\r\naforesaid.\"[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] _Journals of Congress_, XII, 84, 92.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Federal Convention in Philadelphia had the same\r\nquestion to consider. The result of its deliberations on the point\r\nwas not different from that of Congress expressed in the Ordinance.\r\nAmong the concessions to slavery that the Federal Convention felt\r\nconstrained to make, this provision found place in the Constitution:\r\n\"No person held to service or labor in one state under the laws\r\nthereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but\r\nshall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service\r\nor labor may be due.\"[36] Neither of these clauses appears to have\r\nbeen subjected to much debate, and they were adopted by votes that\r\ntestify to their acceptableness; the former received the support of\r\nall members present but one, the latter passed unanimously.\r\n\r\n  [36] Constitution of the United States, Art. IV, § 2. See\r\n  _Revised Statutes of the United States_, I, 18. See also Appendix\r\n  A, p. 359.\r\n\r\nIn the sentiment of the time there seems to have been no sense of\r\nhumiliation on the part of the North over the conclusions reached\r\nconcerning the rendition of escaped slaves. It had been seen by\r\nNorthern men that the subject was one requiring conciliatory\r\ntreatment, if it were not to become a block in the way of certain\r\nSouthern states entering the Union; and, besides, the opinion\r\ngenerally prevailed that slavery would gradually disappear from all\r\nthe states, and the riddle would thus solve itself.[37] The South\r\nwas pleased, but apparently not exultant, over the supposed security\r\ngained for its slave property. General C. C. Pinckney, of South\r\nCarolina, probably expressed the view of most Southerners when he\r\nsaid that the terms for the security of slave property gained by\r\nhis section were not bad, although they were not the best from the\r\nslaveholders' standpoint, and that they permitted the recapture\r\nof runaways in any part of America--a right the South had never\r\nbefore enjoyed.[38] In abstract law the rights of the slave-owner\r\nhad in truth been well provided for. Especially deserving of note\r\nis the fact that a constitutional basis had been furnished for\r\nclaims which, in case slavery did not disappear from the country--a\r\ncontingency not anticipated by the fathers--might be insisted upon\r\nas having the fundamental and positive sanction of the government.\r\nBut what would be the fate of the running slave was a matter with\r\nwhich, after all, private principles and sympathies, and not merely\r\nconstitutional provisions, would have a good deal to do in each case.\r\n\r\n  [37] Elliot's _Debates_. See also George Livermore's _Historical\r\n  Research Respecting the Opinions of the Founders of the Republic\r\n  on Negroes, as Citizens and as Soldiers_, 1862, p. 51 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  [38] Elliot's _Debates_, III, 277.\r\n\r\nFor several years the stipulations for the rendition of fugitive\r\nslaves remained inoperative. At length, in 1791, a case of\r\nkidnapping occurred at Washington, Pennsylvania, and this served\r\nto bring the subject once more to the public mind. Early in 1793\r\nCongress passed the first Fugitive Slave Law.[39] This law provided\r\nfor the reclamation of fugitives from justice and fugitives from\r\nlabor. We are concerned, of course, with the latter class only.\r\nThe sections of the act dealing with this division are too long to\r\nbe here quoted: they empowered the owner, his agent or attorney,\r\nto seize the fugitive and take him before a United States circuit\r\nor district judge within the state where the arrest was made, or\r\nbefore any local magistrate within the county in which the seizure\r\noccurred. The oral testimony of the claimant, or an affidavit\r\nfrom a magistrate in the state from which he came, must certify\r\nthat the fugitive owed service as claimed. Upon such showing the\r\nclaimant secured his warrant for removing the runaway to the state\r\nor territory from which he had fled. Five hundred dollars fine\r\nconstituted the penalty for hindering arrest, or for rescuing or\r\nharboring the fugitive after notice that he or she was a fugitive\r\nfrom labor.\r\n\r\n  [39] Appendix A, pp. 359-361.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence goes to show that this law was ineffectual; Mrs.\r\nMcDougall points out that two cases of resistance to the principle\r\nof the act occurred before the close of 1793.[40] Attempts at\r\namendment were made in Congress as early as the winter of 1796,\r\nand were repeated at irregular intervals down to 1850. Secret or\r\n\"underground\" methods of rescue were already well understood in and\r\naround Philadelphia by 1804. Ohio and Pennsylvania, and perhaps\r\nother states, heeded the complaints of neighboring slave states,\r\nand gave what force they might to the law of 1793 by enacting laws\r\nfor the recovery of fugitives within their borders. The law of\r\nPennsylvania for this purpose was passed the same year in which\r\nMr. Clay, then Secretary of State, began negotiations with England\r\nlooking toward the extradition of slaves from Canada (1826); but\r\nit was quashed by the decision of the United States Supreme Court\r\nin the Prigg case in 1842.[41] By 1850 the Northern states were\r\ntraversed by numerous lines of Underground Railroad, and the South\r\nwas declaring its losses of slave property to be enormous.\r\n\r\n  [40] _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 19.\r\n\r\n  [41] See Chap. IX, pp. 259-267; also Stroud, _Sketch of the Laws\r\n  Relating to Slavery in the Several States_, 2d ed., pp. 220-222.\r\n\r\nThe result of the frequent transgressions of the Fugitive Slave Law\r\non the one hand and of the clamorous demand for a measure adequate\r\nto the needs of the South on the other, was the passage of a new\r\nFugitive Recovery Bill in 1850.[42] The increased rigor of the\r\nprovisions of this act was ill adapted to generate the respect that\r\na good law secures, and, indeed, must have in order to be enforced.\r\nThe law contained features sufficiently objectionable to make many\r\nconverts to the cause of the abolitionists; and a systematic evasion\r\nof the law was regarded as an imperative duty by thousands. The\r\nFugitive Slave Act of 1850 was based on the earlier law, but was\r\nfitted out with a number of clauses, dictated by a self-interest\r\non the part of the South that ignored the rights of every party\r\nsave those of the master. Under the regulations of the act the\r\ncertificate authorizing the arrest and removal of a fugitive slave\r\nwas to be granted to the claimant by the United States commissioner,\r\nthe courts, or the judge of the proper circuit, district, or county.\r\nIf the arrest were made without process, the claimant was to take\r\nthe fugitive forthwith before the commissioner or other official,\r\nand there the case was to be determined in a summary manner. The\r\nrefusal of a United States marshal or his deputies to execute a\r\ncommissioner's certificate, properly directed, involved a fine of\r\none thousand dollars; and failure to prevent the escape of the negro\r\nafter arrest, made the marshal liable, on his official bond, for the\r\nvalue of the slave. When necessary to insure a faithful observance\r\nof the fugitive slave clause in the Constitution, the commissioners,\r\nor persons appointed by them, had the authority to summon the posse\r\ncomitatus of the county, and \"all good citizens\" were \"commanded\r\nto aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution\" of the\r\nlaw. The testimony of the alleged fugitive could not be received\r\nin evidence. Ownership was determined by the simple affidavit of\r\nthe person claiming the slave; and when determined it was shielded\r\nby the certificate of the commissioner from \"all molestation ...\r\nby any process issued by any court, judge, magistrate, or other\r\nperson whomsoever.\" Any act meant to obstruct the claimant in his\r\narrest of the fugitive, or any attempt to rescue, harbor, or conceal\r\nthe fugitive, laid the person interfering liable \"to a fine not\r\nexceeding one thousand dollars, and imprisonment not exceeding six\r\nmonths,\" also liable for \"civil damages to the party injured in the\r\nsum of one thousand dollars for each fugitive so lost.\" In all\r\ncases where the proceedings took place before a commissioner he\r\nwas \"entitled to a fee of ten dollars in full for his services,\"\r\nprovided that a warrant for the fugitive's arrest was issued; if,\r\nhowever, the fugitive was discharged, the commissioner was entitled\r\nto five dollars only.[43]\r\n\r\n  [42] Appendix A, pp. 361-366.\r\n\r\n  [43] _Statutes at Large_, IX, 462-465.\r\n\r\nBy the abolitionists, at whom it was directed, this law was\r\ndetested. A government, whose first national manifesto contained the\r\nexalted principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence,\r\nstooping to the task of slave-catching, violated all their ideas\r\nof national dignity, decency and consistency. Many persons,\r\nindeed, justified their opposition to the law in the familiar\r\nwords: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\r\ncreated equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\ninalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness.\" The scriptural injunction \"not to deliver\r\nunto his master the servant that hath escaped,\"[44] was also\r\nfrequently quoted by men whose religious convictions admitted of\r\nno compromise. They pointed out that the law virtually made all\r\nNorthern citizens accomplices in what they denominated the crime\r\nof slave-catching; that it denied the right of trial by jury,\r\nresting the question of lifelong liberty on ex-parte evidence; made\r\nineffective the writ of habeas corpus; and offered a bribe to the\r\ncommissioner for a decision against the negro.[45] The penalties of\r\nfine and imprisonment for offenders against the law were severe,\r\nbut they had no deterrent effect upon those engaged in helping\r\nslaves to Canada. On the contrary, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850\r\nstimulated the work of secret emancipation. \"The passage of the new\r\nlaw,\" says a recent investigator, \"probably increased the number of\r\nanti-slavery people more than anything else that had occurred during\r\nthe whole agitation. Many of those formerly indifferent were roused\r\nto active opposition by a sense of the injustice of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Act as they saw it executed in Boston and elsewhere.... As\r\nMr. James Freeman Clarke has said, 'It was impossible to convince\r\nthe people that it was right to send back to slavery men who were so\r\ndesirous of freedom as to run such risks. All education from boyhood\r\nup to manhood had taught us to believe that it was the duty of all\r\nmen to struggle for freedom.'\"[46]\r\n\r\n  [44] _Deut._ xxiii, 15, 16.\r\n\r\n  [45] See _Some Recollections of the Anti-Slavery Conflict_, by S.\r\n  J. May, p. 345 _et seq._; Stroud's _Sketch of the Laws Relating\r\n  to Slavery in the Several States_, 2d ed., 1856, pp. 271-280;\r\n  Wilson, _History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol.\r\n  II, pp. 304-322.\r\n\r\n  [46] M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 43; J. F. Clarke,\r\n  _Anti-Slavery Days_, p. 92.\r\n\r\nThe desire for freedom was in the mind of nearly every enslaved\r\nnegro. Liberty was the subject of the dreams and visions of slave\r\npreachers and sibyls; it was the object of their prayers. The\r\nplaintive songs of the enslaved race were full of the thought of\r\nfreedom. It has been well said that \"one of the finest touches in\r\n_Uncle Tom's Cabin_ is the joyful expression of Uncle Tom when\r\ntold by his good and indulgent master that he should be set free\r\nand sent back to his old home in Kentucky. In attributing the\r\ncommon desire of humanity to the negro the author was as true as\r\nshe was effective.\"[47] To slaves living in the vicinity, Mexico\r\nand Florida early afforded a welcome refuge. Forests, islands and\r\nswamps within the Southern states were favorite places of resort for\r\nrunaways. The Great Dismal Swamp became the abode of a large colony\r\nof these refugees, whose lives were spent in its dark recesses, and\r\nwhose families were reared and buried there. Even in this retreat,\r\nhowever, the negroes were not beyond molestation, for they were\r\nsystematically hunted by men with dogs and guns.[48] Scraps of\r\ninformation about Canada and the Northern states were gleaned and\r\ntreasured by minds recognizing their own degradation, but scarcely\r\nknowing how to take the first step towards the betterment of their\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n  [47] Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. I, p. 377.\r\n\r\n  [48] F. L. Olmsted, _Journey in the Back Country_, p. 155; Rev.\r\n  W. M. Mitchell, _The Underground Railroad_, pp. 72, 73; M. G.\r\n  McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 57.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the form in which slavery existed in\r\nthe South during the opening decade of the present century was\r\ncomparatively mild; but it is quite clear that it soon exchanged\r\nthis character for one from which the amenities of the patriarchal\r\ntype had practically disappeared. With the rapid expansion of\r\nthe industries peculiar to the South after the opening up of the\r\nLouisiana purchase, the invention of the cotton gin, and the removal\r\nof the Indians from the Gulf states, came the era of the slave's\r\ndismay. The auction block and the brutal overseer became his dread\r\nwhile awake, his nightmare when asleep. That his fears were not ill\r\nfounded is proved by the activity of the slave-marts of Baltimore,\r\nRichmond, New Orleans and Washington from the time of the migrations\r\nto the Mississippi territory until the War. Alabama is said to have\r\nbought millions of dollars worth of slaves from the border states up\r\nto 1849. Dew estimated that six thousand slaves were carried from\r\nVirginia, though not all of these were sold to other states.[49]\r\n\r\n  [49] Edward Ingle, _Southern Side-Lights_, p. 293.\r\n\r\nThe fear of sale to the far South must have stimulated slaves to\r\nflight. That the number of escapes did increase is deduced from\r\nthe consensus of abolitionist testimony. Our sole reliance is upon\r\nthis testimony until the appearance of the United States census\r\nreports for 1850 and 1860;[50] and the exhibits on fugitive slaves\r\nin these compendiums we are constrained by various considerations\r\nto regard as inadequate. However, the flight of slaves from the\r\nSouth was not what the new conditions would readily account for. We\r\nmust conclude, therefore, that the deterring effect of ignorance\r\nand the sense of the difficulties in the way were reënforced after\r\n1840 by increased vigilance on the part of the slave-owning class,\r\nowing to the rise in value of slave property. \"Since 1840,\" says a\r\ncareful observer, \"the high price of slaves may be supposed ... to\r\nhave increased the vigilance and energy with which the recapture\r\nof fugitives is followed up, and to have augmented the number of\r\nfree negroes reduced to slavery by kidnappers. Indeed it has led\r\nto a proposition being quite seriously entertained in Virginia,\r\nof enslaving the whole body of the free negroes in that state by\r\nlegislative enactment.\"[51] Then, too, the negro's attachment to\r\nthe land of his birth, and to his kindred, when these were not torn\r\nfrom him, must be allowed to have hindered flight in many instances;\r\nwhen, however, the appearance of the dreaded slave-dealer, or\r\nthe brutality of the overseer or the master, spread dismay among\r\nthe hands of a plantation, flights were likely to follow. This\r\nwas sometimes the case, too, when by the death of a planter the\r\ndivision of his property among his heirs was made necessary. William\r\nJohnson, of Windsor, Ontario, ran away from his Kentucky master\r\nbecause he was threatened with being sent South to the cotton and\r\nrice fields.[52] Horace Washington, of Windsor, after working\r\nnearly two years for a man that had a claim on him for one hundred\r\nand twenty-five dollars, reminded his employer that the original\r\nagreement required but one year's labor, and asked for release.\r\nGetting no satisfaction, and fearing sale, he fled to Canada.[53]\r\nLewis Richardson, one of the slaves of Henry Clay, sought relief\r\nin flight after receiving a hundred and fifty stripes from Mr.\r\nClay's overseer.[54] William Edwards, of Amherstburg, Ontario,\r\nleft his master on account of a severe flogging.[55] One of the\r\nstation-keepers of an underground line in Morgan County, Ohio,\r\nrecalls an instance of a family of seven fugitives giving as the\r\ncause of their flight the death of their master, and the expected\r\nscattering of their number when the division of the estate should\r\noccur.[56]\r\n\r\n  [50] These reports will be dealt with in another connection.

The hostile\r\nrelations existing between the two nations at that time caused\r\nnegroes of sagacious minds to seek their liberty among the enemies\r\nof the United States.[57] Then, too, soldiers returning from the War\r\nto their homes in Kentucky and Virginia brought the news of the\r\ndisposition of the Canadian government to defend the rights of the\r\nself-emancipated slaves under its jurisdiction. Rumors of this sort\r\ngave hope and courage to the blacks that heard it, and, doubtless,\r\nthe welcome reports were spread by these among trusted companions\r\nand friends. By 1815 fugitives were crossing the Western Reserve in\r\nOhio, and regular stations of the Underground Railroad were lending\r\nthem assistance in that and other portions of the state.[58]\r\n\r\n  [57] S. G. Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp.\r\n  11, 12.\r\n\r\n  [58] Wilson, _History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_,\r\n  Vol. II, p. 63.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of Canada by colored refugees from the Southern\r\nstates, it was, presumably, not long before some of them, returning\r\nfor their families and friends, gave circulation in a limited way\r\nto reports more substantial than the vague rumors hitherto afloat.\r\nAmong the escaped slaves that carried the promise of Canadian\r\nliberty across Mason and Dixon's line were such successful abductors\r\nas Josiah Henson and Harriet Tubman. In 1860 it was estimated that\r\nthe number of negroes that journeyed annually from Canada to the\r\nslave states to rescue their fellows was about five hundred. It\r\nwas said that these persons \"carried the Underground Railroad and\r\nthe Underground Telegraph into nearly every Southern state.\"[59]\r\nThe work done by these fugitives was supplemented by the cautious\r\ndissemination of news by white persons that went into the South to\r\nabduct slaves or encourage them to escape, or while engaged there in\r\nlegitimate occupations used their opportunities to pass the helpful\r\nword or to afford more substantial aid. The Rev. Calvin Fairbank,\r\nthe Rev. Charles T. Torrey and Dr. Alexander M. Ross may be cited\r\nas notable examples of this class. The latter, a citizen of Canada,\r\nmade extensive tours through various slave states for the express\r\npurpose of spreading information about Canada and the routes by\r\nwhich that country could be reached. He made trips into Maryland,\r\nKentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, and did not think it too great a\r\nrisk to make excursions into the more southern states. He went to\r\nNew Orleans, and from that point set out on a journey, in the course\r\nof which he visited Vicksburg, Selma and Columbus, Mississippi,\r\nAugusta, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.[60]\r\n\r\n  [59] Redpath, _The Public Life of Captain John Brown_, p. 229.\r\n\r\n  [60] Dr. A. M. Ross, _Recollections and Experiences of an\r\n  Abolitionist_, 2d ed., 1876, pp. 10, 11, 15, 39.\r\n\r\nConsidering the comparative freedom of movement between the slave\r\nand the free states along the border, it is easy to understand how\r\nslaves in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri might pick up\r\ninformation about the \"Land of Promise\" to the northward. Isaac\r\nWhite, a slave of Kanawha County, Virginia, was shown a map and\r\ninstructed how to get to Canada by a man from Cleveland, Ohio. Allen\r\nSidney, a negro who ran a steamboat on the Tennessee River for his\r\nmaster, first learned of Canada from an abolitionist at Florence,\r\nAlabama.[61] Until the contest over the peculiar institution had\r\nbecome heated, it was not an uncommon thing for slaves to be sent\r\non errands, or even hired out to residents of the border counties\r\nof the free states. Notwithstanding Ohio's political antagonism\r\nto slavery from the beginning, there was a \"tacit tolerance\" of\r\nslavery by the people of the state down to about 1835; and \"numbers\r\nof slaves, as many as two thousand it was sometimes supposed, were\r\nhired ... from Virginia and Kentucky, chiefly by farmers.\" Doubtless\r\nsuch persons heard more or less about Canada, and when the agitation\r\nagainst slavery became vehement, they were approached by friends,\r\nand many were induced to accept transportation to the Queen's\r\ndominions.[62]\r\n\r\n  [61] Conversation with White and Sidney in Canada West, August,\r\n  1895.\r\n\r\n  [62] Rufus King, _Ohio_, in _American Commonwealths_, pp. 364,\r\n  365, relates that some of these slaves were discharged from\r\n  servitude \"by writs of habeas corpus procured in their names,\"\r\n  and that \"numbers were abducted from the slave states and\r\n  concealed, or smuggled by the 'Underground Railroad' into Canada.\"\r\n\r\nDepredations of this sort caused alarm among slaveholders. They\r\nsought to deter their chattels from flight by talking freely before\r\nthem about the rigors of the climate and the poverty of the soil of\r\nCanada. Such talk was wasted on the slaves, who were shrewd enough\r\nto discern the real meaning of their masters. They were alert to\r\ngather all that was said, and interpret it in the light of rumors\r\nfrom other sources. Thus, masters themselves became disseminators\r\nof information they meant to withhold. In this and other ways the\r\nslaves of the border states heard of Canada. The sale of some of\r\nthese slaves to the South helps to explain the knowledge of Canada\r\npossessed by many blacks in those distant parts. When Mr. Ross\r\nvisited Vicksburg, Mississippi, he found that \"many of these negroes\r\nhad heard of Canada from the negroes brought from Virginia and the\r\nborder slave states; but the impression they had was that, Canada\r\nbeing so far away, it would be useless to try to reach it.\"[63]\r\nNotwithstanding the distance, the number of successful escapes\r\nfrom the interior as well as from the border slave states seems\r\nto have been sufficient to arouse the suspicion in the minds of\r\nSoutherners that a secret organization of abolitionists had agents\r\nat work in the South running off slaves. This suspicion was brought\r\nto light during the trial of Richard Dillingham in Tennessee in\r\n1849.[64] The labors of Mr. Ross several years later gave color to\r\nthe same notion. These facts help to explain the insistence of the\r\nlower Southern states on the passage and strict enforcement of the\r\nFugitive Slave Law in 1850.\r\n\r\n  [63] Dr. A. M. Ross, _The Recollections and Experiences of an\r\n  Abolitionist_, p. 38.\r\n\r\n  [64] A. L. Benedict, _Memoir of Richard Dillingham_, p. 17.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of a thing so unfavored as was the Underground Road,\r\nlocal conditions must have a great deal to do. The characteristics\r\nof small and scattered localities, and even of isolated families,\r\nare of the first importance in the consideration of a movement such\r\nas this. These little communities were in general the elements\r\nout of which the underground system built itself up. The sources\r\nof the convictions and confidences that knitted these communities\r\ntogether in defiance of what they considered unjust law can only\r\nbe learned by the study of local conditions. The incorporation in\r\nthe Constitution of the compromises concerning slavery doubtless\r\nquieted the consciences of many of the early friends of universal\r\nliberty. It was only natural, however, that there should be some\r\nthat would hold such concessions to be sinful, and in violation of\r\nthe principles asserted in the Declaration of Independence and in\r\nthe very Preamble of the Constitution itself. These persons would\r\ncling tenaciously to their views, and would aid a fugitive slave\r\nwhenever one would ask protection and help. It is not strange that\r\nrepresentatives of this class should be found more frequently among\r\nthe Quakers than any other sect. In southeastern Pennsylvania and in\r\nNew Jersey the work of helping slaves to escape was, for the most\r\npart, in the hands of Quakers from the beginning. This was true also\r\nof Wilmington, Delaware, New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Valley\r\nFalls, Rhode Island, as of a number of important centres in western\r\nPennsylvania, and eastern, central and southwestern Ohio, in eastern\r\nIndiana, in southern Michigan and in eastern Iowa.\r\n\r\nAnti-slavery views prevailed against the first attempts at\r\nenforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793 in Massachusetts,\r\nand spread to other localities in the New England states. When the\r\ntide of emigration to the Western states set in, settlers from New\r\nEngland were given more frequent occasions to put their principles\r\ninto practice in their new homes than they had known in the seaboard\r\nregion. The western portions of New York and Pennsylvania, as well\r\nas the neighboring section of Ohio, called the Western Reserve, are\r\ndotted over with communities where negroes learned the meaning of\r\nYankee hospitality. Like Joshua R. Giddings, the people of these\r\ncommunities claimed to have borrowed their abolition sentiments\r\nfrom the writings of Jefferson, whose \"abolition tract,\" Giddings\r\nsaid, \"was called the Declaration of Independence.\"[65] In northern\r\nIllinois there were many centres of the New England type, though, of\r\ncourse, not all the underground stations in that region were kept by\r\nNew Englanders.\r\n\r\n  [65] George W. Julian, _Life of Joshua R. Giddings_, p. 157.\r\n\r\nIn a few neighborhoods settlers from the Southern states were\r\nhelpers. These persons had left the South on account of slavery;\r\nthey preferred to raise their families away from influences they\r\nfelt to be harmful; and they pitied the slave. It was easy for\r\nthem to give shelter to the self-freed negro. In south central\r\nOhio, in a district of four or five counties locally known as the\r\nold Chillicothe Presbytery, a number of the early preachers were\r\nanti-slavery men from the Southern states. Among the number were\r\nJohn Rankin, of Ripley, James Gilliland, of Red Oak, Jesse Lockhart,\r\nof Russellville, Robert B. Dobbins, of Sardinia, Samuel Crothers,\r\nof Greenfield, Hugh S. Fullerton, of Chillicothe, and William\r\nDickey, of Ross or Fayette County. The Presbyterian churches over\r\nwhich these men presided became centres of opposition to slavery,\r\nand fugitives finding their way into the vicinity of any one of\r\nthem were likely to receive the needed help.[66] The stations in\r\nBond, Putnam and Bureau counties, Illinois, were kept in part by\r\nanti-slavery settlers from the South.\r\n\r\n  [66] _History of Brown County, Ohio_, p. 313 _et seq._ Also\r\n  letter of Dr. Isaac M. Beck, Sardinia, O., Dec. 26, 1892. Mr.\r\n  Beck was born in 1807, and knew personally the clergymen named.\r\n  He joined the abolition movement in 1835. His excellent letter is\r\n  verified in various points by other correspondents.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of record in this connection that the teachings\r\nof the two sects, the Scotch Covenanters and the Wesleyan\r\nMethodists, did not exclude the negro from the bonds of Christian\r\nbrotherhood, and where churches of either denomination existed the\r\nRoad was likely to be found in active operation. Within the borders\r\nof Logan County, Ohio, there were a number of Covenanter homes that\r\nreceived fugitives; and in southern Illinois, between the towns\r\nof Chester and Centralia, there was a series of such hospitable\r\nplaces. There were several Wesleyan Methodist stations in Harrison\r\nCounty, Ohio, and with these were intermixed a few of the Covenanter\r\ndenomination.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that negro settlements in the free states should be\r\nresorted to by fugitive slaves. The colored people of Greenwich, New\r\nJersey, the Stewart Settlement of Jackson County, Ohio, the Upper\r\nand Lower Camps, Brown County, Ohio, and the Colored Settlement,\r\nHamilton County, Indiana, were active. The list of towns and cities\r\nin which negroes became coworkers with white persons in harboring\r\nand concealing runaways is a long one. Oberlin, Portsmouth and\r\nCincinnati, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and\r\nBoston, Massachusetts, will suffice as examples.\r\n\r\nThe principles and experience gained by a number of students while\r\nattending college in Oberlin did not come amiss later when these\r\nyoung men established themselves in Iowa. Professor L. F. Parker,\r\nafter describing what was probably the longest line of travel\r\nthrough Iowa for escaped slaves, says: \"Along this line Quakers\r\nand Oberlin students were the chief namable groups whose houses\r\nwere open to such travellers more certainly than to white men,\"[67]\r\nand the Rev. William M. Brooks, a graduate of Oberlin, until\r\nrecently President of Tabor College, writes: \"The stations ... in\r\nsouthwestern Iowa were in the region of Civil Bend, where the colony\r\nfrom Oberlin, Ohio, settled which afterwards settled Tabor.\"[68]\r\n\r\n  [67] Letter from Professor L. F. Parker, Grinnell, Iowa, Aug. 30,\r\n  1894.\r\n\r\n  [68] Letter from President W. M. Brooks, Tabor, Iowa, Oct. 11,\r\n  1894.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Underground Road dates farther back than is\r\ngenerally known; though, to be sure, the different divisions of the\r\nRoad were not contemporary in development. Two letters of George\r\nWashington, written in 1786, give the first reports, as yet known,\r\nof systematic efforts for the aid and protection of fugitive slaves.\r\nOne of these letters bears the date May 12, and the other, November\r\n20. In the former, Washington speaks of the slave of a certain Mr.\r\nDalby residing at Alexandria, who has escaped to Philadelphia, and\r\n\"whom a society of Quakers in the city, formed for such purposes,\r\nhave attempted to liberate.\"[69] In the latter he writes of a slave\r\nwhom he sent \"under the care of a trusty overseer\" to the Hon.\r\nWilliam Drayton, but who afterwards escaped. He says: \"The gentleman\r\nto whose care I sent him has promised every endeavor to apprehend\r\nhim, but it is not easy to do this, when there are numbers who\r\nwould rather facilitate the escape of slaves than apprehend them\r\nwhen runaways.\"[70] The difficulties attending the pursuit of the\r\nDrayton slave, like those in the other case mentioned, seem to have\r\nbeen associated in Washington's mind with the procedure of certain\r\ncitizens of Pennsylvania; it is quite possible that he was again\r\nreferring to the Quaker society in Philadelphia. However that may\r\nbe, it appears probable that the record of Philadelphia as a centre\r\nof active sympathy with the fugitive slave was continuous from the\r\ntime of Washington's letters. In 1787 Isaac T. Hopper, who soon\r\nbecame known as a friend of slaves, settled in Philadelphia, and,\r\nalthough only sixteen or seventeen years old, had already taken a\r\nresolution to befriend the oppressed Africans.[71] Some cases of\r\nkidnapping that occurred in Columbia, Pennsylvania, in 1804, stirred\r\nthe citizens of that town to intervention in the runaways' behalf;\r\nand the movement seems to have spread rapidly among the Quakers of\r\nChester, Lancaster, York, Montgomery, Berks and Bucks counties.[72]\r\nNew Jersey was probably not behind southeastern Pennsylvania in\r\npoint of time in Underground Railroad work. This is to be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that the adjacent parts of the two states were largely\r\nsettled by people of a sect distinctly opposed to slavery, and were\r\nknitted together by those ties of blood that are known to have\r\nbeen favorable in other quarters to the development of underground\r\nroutes. That protection was given to fugitives early in the present\r\ncentury by the Quakers of southwestern New Jersey can scarcely\r\nbe doubted; and we are told that negroes were being transported\r\nthrough New Jersey before 1818.[73] New York was closely allied\r\nwith the New Jersey and Philadelphia centres as far back as our\r\nmeagre records will permit us to go. Isaac T. Hopper, who had grown\r\nfamiliar with underground methods of procedure in Philadelphia,\r\nmoved to New York in 1829. No doubt his philanthropic arts were\r\nsoon made use of there, for in 1835 we find him accused, though\r\nfalsely this time, of harboring a runaway at his store in Pearl\r\nStreet.[74] Frederick Douglass mentions the assistance rendered\r\nby Mr. Hopper to fugitives in New York; and says that he himself\r\nreceived aid from David Ruggles, a colored man and coworker with the\r\nvenerable Quaker.[75] After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in\r\n1850, New York City became more active than ever in receiving and\r\nforwarding refugees.[76] This city at the mouth of the Hudson was\r\nthe entrepôt for a line of travel by way of Albany, Syracuse and\r\nRochester to Canada, and for another line diverging at Albany, and\r\nextending by the way of Troy to the New England states and Canada;\r\nand these routes appear to have been used at an early date. The\r\nElmira route, which connected Philadelphia with Niagara Falls by\r\nway of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was made use of from about 1850\r\nto 1860. Its comparatively late development is explained by the\r\nfact that one of its principal agents was a fugitive slave, John\r\nW. Jones, who did not settle in Elmira until 1844, and that the\r\nline of the Northern Central Railroad was not completed until about\r\n1850.[77] In western New York fugitives began to arrive from the\r\nneighboring parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio between 1835 and 1840,\r\nif not earlier. Professor Edward Orton recalls that in 1838, soon\r\nafter his father moved to Buffalo, two sleigh-loads of negroes from\r\nthe Western Reserve were brought to the house in the night-time;[78]\r\nand Mr. Frederick Nicholson, of Warsaw, New York, states that the\r\nunderground work in his vicinity began in 1840. From this time on\r\nthere was apparently no cessation of migrations of fugitives into\r\nCanada at Black Rock, Buffalo and other points.[79]\r\n\r\n  [69] Sparks's _Washington_, IX, 158, quoted in _Quakers of\r\n  Pennsylvania_, by Dr. A.

Samuel J. May states\r\nthat as long ago as 1834 slaves were addressed to his care while he\r\nwas living in the eastern part of the state.[84] In Massachusetts\r\nthe town of Fall River became an important station in 1839.[85]\r\nNew Bedford, Boston, Marblehead, Concord, Springfield, Florence\r\nand other places in Massachusetts are known to have given shelter\r\nto fugitives as they travelled northward. Mr. Simeon Dodge, of\r\nMarblehead, who had personal knowledge of what was going on,\r\nrecollects that the Underground Road was active between 1840 and\r\n1860, and his testimony is substantiated by that of a number of\r\nother persons.[86] Doubtless there was underground work going on\r\nin Massachusetts before this period, but it was probably of a less\r\nsystematic character. In Maine fugitives frequently obtained help in\r\nthe early forties. The Rev. O. B. Cheney, later President of Bates\r\nCollege, was concerned in a branch of the Road running from Portland\r\nto Effingham, New Hampshire, and northward, during the years 1843\r\nto 1845.[87] That later conditions probably increased the labors\r\nof the Maine abolitionists appears from the statement of Mr. Brown\r\nThurston, of Portland, that he had at one time after the passage of\r\nthe second Fugitive Slave Law the care of thirty fugitives.[88]\r\n\r\n  [80] Letter of Mr. Aldis O.

The years 1815 to 1817 witnessed,\r\nso far as we now know, the origin of underground lines in both the\r\neastern and western parts of this section. Henry Wilson explains\r\nthis by saying that soldiers from Virginia and Kentucky, returning\r\nhome after the War of 1812, carried back the news that there was a\r\nland of freedom beyond the lakes. John Sloane, of Ravenna, David\r\nHudson, the founder of the town of Hudson, and Owen Brown, the\r\nfather of John Brown of Osawattomie, were among the first of those\r\nknown to have harbored slaves in the eastern part.[89] Edward\r\nHoward, the father of Colonel D. W. H. Howard, of Wauseon, and the\r\nOttawa Indians of the village of Chief Kinjeino were among the\r\nearliest friends of fugitives in the western part.[90] At least\r\none case of underground procedure is reported to have occurred in\r\ncentral Ohio as early as 1812. The report is but one remove from its\r\noriginal source, and was given to Mr. Robert McCrory, of Marysville,\r\nOhio, by Richard Dixon, an eye-witness. The alleged runaway, seized\r\nat Delaware, was unceremoniously taken from the custody of his\r\nmounted captor when the two reached Worthington, and was brought\r\nbefore Colonel James Kilbourne, who served as an official of all\r\nwork in the village he had founded but a few years before. By Mr.\r\nKilbourne's decision, the negro was released, and was then sent\r\nnorth aboard one of the government wagons engaged at the time in\r\ncarrying military supplies to Sandusky.[91] That such action was\r\nnot inconsistent with the character of Colonel Kilbourne and his\r\nNew England associates is evidenced by the fact that as an agent\r\nfor \"The Scioto Company,\" formed in Granby, Connecticut, in the\r\nwinter of 1801-1802, he had delayed the purchase of a township in\r\nOhio for settlement until a state constitution forbidding slavery\r\nshould be adopted.[92] If now the testimony of the oldest surviving\r\nabolitionists from the different regions of the state be compared,\r\nsome interesting results may be found. Job Mullin, a Quaker of\r\nWarren County, in his eighty-ninth year when his statement was\r\ngiven, says: \"The most active time to my knowledge was from 1816\r\nto 1830....\" In 1829 Mr. Mullin moved off the line with which he\r\nhad been connected and took no further part in the work.[93] Mr.\r\nEliakim H. Moore, for a number of years the treasurer of Ohio\r\nUniversity at Athens, says that the work began near Athens during\r\n1823 and 1824. \"In those years not so many attempted to escape as\r\nlater, from 1845 to 1860.\"[94] Dr. Thomas Cowgill, an aged Quaker\r\nof Kennard, Champaign County, recollects that the work of the\r\nUnderground Railroad began in his neighborhood about 1824. The time\r\nbetween 1840 and the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law he regards\r\nas the period of greatest activity within his experience. Joseph\r\nSkillgess, a colored citizen of Urbana, now seventy-six years old,\r\nsays that it is among his earliest recollections that runaways\r\nwere entertained at Dry Run Church, in Ross County.[95] William A.\r\nJohnston, an old resident of Coshocton, testifies: \"We had such\r\na road here as early as the twenties, I know from tradition and\r\npersonal observation.\"[96] Mahlon Pickrell, a prominent Quaker of\r\nLogan County, writes: \"There was some travel on the Underground\r\nRailroad as early as 1820, but the period of greatest activity in\r\nthis vicinity was between 1840 and 1850.\"[97] Finally, Mr. R. C.\r\nCorwin, of Lebanon, writes: \"My first recollection of the business\r\ndates back to about 1820, when I remember seeing fugitives at my\r\nfather's house, though I dare say it had been going on long before\r\nthat time. From that time until 1840 there was a gradual increase of\r\nbusiness. From 1840 to 1860 might be called the period of greatest\r\nactivity.\"[98] Among these aged witnesses, those have been quoted\r\nwhose experience, character and clearness of mind gave weight to\r\ntheir words. Mr. Rush R. Sloane, of Sandusky, who made some local\r\ninvestigations in northwestern Ohio and published the results in\r\n1888, produces some evidence that agrees with the testimony just\r\ngiven. He found that, \"The first runaway slave known as such at\r\nSandusky was there in the fall of the year 1820.... Judge Jabez\r\nWright, one of the three associate judges who held the first term\r\nof court in Huron County in 1815, was among the first white men\r\nupon the Firelands to aid fugitive slaves; he never failed when\r\nopportunity offered to lend a helping hand to the fugitives,\r\nsecreting them when necessary, feeding them when they were hungry,\r\nclothing and employing them.\"[99] After reciting a number of\r\ninstances of rescues occurring between 1820 and 1850, Mr. Sloane\r\nremarks that one of the immediate results of the passage of the\r\nsecond Fugitive Slave Law was the increased travel of fugitives\r\nthrough the State of Ohio.[100] The foregoing items have been\r\nbrought together to show that there was no break in the business of\r\nthe Road from the beginning to the end. The death or the change of\r\nresidence of abolitionists may have interrupted travel on one or\r\nanother route, and may even have broken a line permanently, but the\r\nhistory of the Underground Railroad system in Ohio is continuous.\r\n\r\n  [89] Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol. II, p.\r\n  63; Alexander Black, _The Story of Ohio_, see account of the\r\n  Underground Railroad.\r\n\r\n  [90] Letter of Col.

We\r\nare informed that \"Vestal Coffin organized the Underground Railroad\r\nnear the present Guilford College in 1819. Addison Coffin, his\r\nson, entered its service as a conductor in early youth and still\r\nsurvives in hale old age.... Vestal's cousin, Levi Coffin, became\r\nan anti-slavery apostle in early youth and continued unflinching to\r\nthe end. His early years were spent in North Carolina, whence he\r\nhelped many slaves to reach the West.\"[101] Levi Coffin removed to\r\nIndiana in 1826. Of his own and his cousin's activities in behalf\r\nof slaves while still a resident of North Carolina, Mr. Coffin\r\nwrites: \"Runaway slaves used frequently to conceal themselves in\r\nthe woods and thickets of New Garden, waiting opportunities to make\r\ntheir escape to the North, and I generally learned their places of\r\nconcealment and rendered them all the service in my power.... These\r\noutlying slaves knew where I lived, and, when reduced to extremity\r\nof want or danger, often came to my room, in the silence and\r\ndarkness of the night, to obtain food or assistance. In my efforts\r\nto aid these fugitives I had a zealous coworker in my friend and\r\ncousin Vestal Coffin, who was then, and continued to the time of his\r\ndeath--a few years later--a staunch friend to the slave.\"[102] When\r\nLevi Coffin emigrated in 1826 to southeastern Indiana, he did not\r\ngive up his active interest in the fleeing slave, and his house at\r\nNewport (now Fountain City) became a centre at which three distinct\r\nlines of Underground Road converged. It is probable, however, that\r\nwayfarers from bondage found aid from pioneer settlers in Indiana\r\nbefore Friend Coffin's arrival. John F. Williams, of Economy,\r\nIndiana, says that fugitives \"commenced coming in 1820,\" and he\r\ndenominated himself \"an agent since 1820,\" although he \"never kept\r\na depot till 1852.\"[103] It is scarcely necessary to make a showing\r\nof testimony to prove that an expansion of routes like that taking\r\nplace in Ohio and states farther east occurred also in Indiana.\r\n\r\n  [101] Stephen B. Weeks, _Southern Quakers and Slavery_, p. 242.\r\n\r\n  [102] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, 2d ed., pp. 20, 21.\r\n\r\n  [103] Letter from John F. Williams, Economy, Ind., March 21,\r\n  1893. When this letter was written, Mr. Williams was eighty-one\r\n  years old. He was, he says, born in 1812. In 1820 he would have\r\n  been eight years old. Children were sometimes sent to carry food\r\n  to refugees in hiding, or to do other little services with which\r\n  they could be safely trusted. Such experiences were apt to make\r\n  deep impressions on their young memories.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful at what time stations first came to exist in\r\nIllinois. Mr. H. B. Leeper, an old resident of that state, assigns\r\ntheir origin to the years 1819 and 1820, at which time a small\r\ncolony of anti-slavery people from Brown County, Ohio, settled in\r\nBond County, southern Illinois. Emigrations from this locality to\r\nPutnam County, about 1830, led, he thinks, to the establishment\r\nthere of a new centre for this work. These settlers were persons\r\nthat had left South Carolina on account of slavery, and during their\r\nresidence in Brown County, Ohio, had accepted the abolitionist views\r\nof the Rev. James Gilliland, a Presbyterian preacher of Red Oak;\r\nand in Illinois they did not shrink from putting their principles\r\ninto practice. This account is plausible, and as it is substantiated\r\nin certain parts by facts from the history of Brown County, Ohio,\r\nit may be considered probable in those parts that are and must\r\nremain without corroboration. Concerning his father Mr. Leeper\r\nwrites: \"John Leeper moved from Marshall County, Tennessee, to Bond\r\nCounty, Illinois, in 1816. Was a hater of slavery.... Remained\r\nin Bond County until 1823, then moved to Jacksonville, Morgan\r\nCounty, and in 1831 to Putnam County, and in 1833 to Bureau County,\r\nIllinois.... My father's house was always a hiding-place for the\r\nfugitive from slavery.\"[104] On the basis of this testimony, and\r\nthe probability in the case, we may believe that the underground\r\nmovement in Illinois dates back, at least, to the time of the\r\nadmission of Illinois into the Union, that is, to 1818. Soon after\r\n1835, the movement seems to have become well established, and to\r\nhave increased in importance with considerable rapidity till the War.\r\n\r\n  [104] Letter from H. B. Leeper, Princeton, Ill., received Dec.\r\n  19, 1895. Mr. Leeper is seventy-five years of age. His letter\r\n  shows a knowledge of the localities of which he writes, Bond\r\n  County in southwestern Illinois, and Bureau and Putnam Counties\r\n  in the central part of the state.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of note that the years that witnessed the\r\nbeginnings in Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina and Illinois of this\r\ncurious method of assailing the slave power, precede but slightly\r\nthose that witnessed the formulation of three several bills in\r\nCongress designed to strengthen the first Fugitive Slave Law. The\r\nthree measures were drafted during the interval from 1818 to 1822.\r\n\r\nThe abolitionist enterprises of the more western states, Iowa and\r\nKansas, came too late to be in any way connected with the proposal\r\nof these bills. The settlement of these territories was, of course,\r\nconsiderably behind that of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, but the\r\nnearness of the new regions to a slaveholding section insured the\r\nopportunity for Underground Railroad work as soon as settlement\r\nshould begin. Professor L. F. Parker, of Tabor College, Iowa, has\r\nsketched briefly the successive steps in the opening of his state\r\nto occupancy. \"The Black-Hawk Purchase opened the eastern edge of\r\nIowa to the depth of 40 or 50 miles to the whites in 1833. The\r\nstrip ... west of that which included what is now Grinnell was not\r\nopened to white occupancy till 1843, and it was ten years later\r\nbefore the white residents in this county numbered 500. Grinnell was\r\nsettled in 1854, when central and western Iowa was merely dotted\r\nby a few hamlets of white men, and seamed by winding paths along\r\nprairie ridges and through bridgeless streams.\"[105] One of the\r\nearly settlers in southeastern Iowa was J. H. B. Armstrong, who\r\nhad been familiar with the midnight appeals of escaping slaves in\r\nFayette County, Ohio. Mr. Armstrong removed to the West in 1839,\r\nand settled in Lee County, Iowa. His proximity to the northeastern\r\nboundary of Missouri seems to have involved him in Underground\r\nRailroad work from the start, on the route running to Salem and\r\nDenmark. When in 1852 Mr. Armstrong moved to Appanoose County, and\r\nlocated within four miles of the Missouri line, among a number of\r\nabolitionists, he found himself even more concerned with secret\r\nprojects to help slaves to Canada. The lines of travel of fugitive\r\nslaves that extended east throughout the entire length of Iowa were\r\nmore or less associated with Kansas men and Kansas movements, and\r\ntheir development is, therefore, to be assigned to the time of the\r\noutbreak of the struggle over Kansas (1854). Residents of Tabor\r\nin southwestern Iowa, and of Grinnell in central Iowa, agree in\r\ndesignating 1854 as the year in which their Underground Railroad\r\nlabors began. The Rev. John Todd, one of the founders of the college\r\ncolony of Tabor, is authority for the statement that the first\r\nfugitives arrived in the summer of 1854.[106] Professor Parker\r\nstates that Grinnell was a stopping-place for the hunted slave from\r\nthe time of its founding in 1854.\r\n\r\n  [105] Letter from Professor L. F. Parker, Grinnell, Iowa, Aug.\r\n  30, 1894.\r\n\r\n  [106] Letter from Professor James E. Todd, Vermillion, South\r\n  Dakota, Nov. 6, 1894. Professor Todd is the son of the Rev. John\r\n  Todd.\r\n\r\n  The _Tabor Beacon_, 1890, 1891, contains a series of\r\n  reminiscences from the pen of the Rev. John Todd. The first of\r\n  these recounts the first arrival of fugitives in July, 1854.\r\n\r\nWe may summarize our findings in regard to the expansion of the\r\nUnderground Railroad, then, by saying that it had grown into a\r\nwide-spread \"institution\" before the year 1840, and in several\r\nstates it had existed in previous decades. This statement coincides\r\nwith the findings of Dr. Samuel G. Howe in Canada, while on a tour\r\nof investigation in 1863. He reports that the arrivals of runaway\r\nslaves in the provinces, at first rare, increased early in the\r\ncentury; that some of the fugitives, rejoicing in the personal\r\nfreedom they had gained and banishing all fear of the perils they\r\nmust endure, went stealthily back to their former homes and brought\r\naway their wives and children. The Underground Road was of great\r\nassistance to these and other escaping slaves, and \"hundreds,\" says\r\nDr. Howe, \"trod this path every year, but they did not attract much\r\npublic attention.\"[107] It does not escape Dr. Howe's consideration,\r\nhowever, that the fugitive slaves in Canada were soon brought to\r\npublic notice by the diplomatic negotiations between England and the\r\nUnited States during the years 1826-1828, the object being, as Mr.\r\nClay, the Secretary of State, himself declared, \"to provide for a\r\ngrowing evil.\" The evidence gathered from surviving abolitionists\r\nin the states adjacent to the lakes shows an increased activity of\r\nthe Underground Road during the period 1830-1840. The reason for\r\nflight given by the slave was, in the great majority of cases, the\r\nsame, namely, fear of being sold to the far South. It is certainly\r\nsignificant in this connection that the decade above mentioned\r\nwitnessed the removal of the Indians from the Gulf states, and,\r\nin the words of another contemporary observer and reporter, \"the\r\nconsequent opening of new and vast cotton fields.\"[108] The swelling\r\nemphasis laid upon the value of their escaped slaves by the Southern\r\nrepresentatives in Congress, and by the South generally, resounded\r\nwith terrific force at length in the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.\r\nThat act did not, as it appears, check or diminish in any way the\r\nnumber of underground rescues. In spite of the exhibit on fugitive\r\nslaves made in the United States census report of 1860, which\r\npurports to show that the number of escapes was about a thousand a\r\nyear, it is difficult to doubt the consensus of testimony of many\r\nunderground agents, to the effect that the decade from 1850 to 1860\r\nwas the period of the Road's greatest activity in all sections of\r\nthe North.[109]\r\n\r\n  [107] S. G. Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_,\r\n  1864, pages 11, 12.\r\n\r\n  [108] G. M. Weston, _Progress of Slavery in the United States_,\r\n  Washington, D.C., 1858, p. 22.\r\n\r\n  [109] Some conclusions presented in the _American Historical\r\n  Review_, April, 1896, pp. 460-462, are here repeated.\r\n\r\nIt is not known when the name \"Underground Railroad\" came to be\r\napplied to these secret trails, nor where it was first applied\r\nto them. According to Mr. Smedley the designation came into use\r\namong slave-hunters in the neighborhood of Columbia soon after the\r\nQuakers in southeastern Pennsylvania began their concerted action\r\nin harboring and forwarding fugitives. The pursuers seem to have had\r\nlittle difficulty in tracking slaves as far as Columbia, but beyond\r\nthat point all trace of them was generally lost. All the various\r\nmethods of detection customary in such cases were resorted to, but\r\nfailed to bring the runaways to view. The mystery enshrouding these\r\ndisappearances completely bewildered and baffled the slave-owners\r\nand their agents, who are said to have declared, \"there must be\r\nan Underground Railroad somewhere.\"[110] As this work reached\r\nconsiderable development in the district indicated during the first\r\ndecade of this century the account quoted is seen to contain an\r\nanachronism. Railroads were not known either in England or the\r\nUnited States until about 1830, so that the word \"railroad\" could\r\nscarcely have received its figurative application as early as Mr.\r\nSmedley implies.\r\n\r\n  [110] R. C. Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, pp. 34, 35.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Rush R. Sloane, of Sandusky, Ohio, gives the following\r\naccount of the naming of the Road: \"In the year 1831, a fugitive\r\nnamed Tice Davids came over the line and lived just back of\r\nSandusky. He had come direct from Ripley, Ohio, where he crossed the\r\nOhio River....\r\n\r\n\"When he was running away, his master, a Kentuckian, was in close\r\npursuit and pressing him so hard that when the Ohio River was\r\nreached he had no alternative but to jump in and swim across. It\r\ntook his master some time to secure a skiff, in which he and his\r\naid followed the swimming fugitive, keeping him in sight until he\r\nhad landed. Once on shore, however, the master could not find him.\r\nNo one had seen him; and after a long ... search the disappointed\r\nslave-master went into Ripley, and when inquired of as to what had\r\nbecome of his slave, said ... he thought 'the nigger must have gone\r\noff on an underground road.' The story was repeated with a good deal\r\nof amusement, and this incident gave the name to the line. First\r\nthe 'Underground Road,' afterwards 'Underground Railroad.'\"[111]\r\nA colored man, the Rev. W. M. Mitchell, who was for several years\r\na resident of southern Ohio, and a friend of fugitives, gives\r\nwhat appears to be a version of Mr. Sloane's story.[112] These\r\nanecdotes are hardly more than traditions, affording a fair general\r\nexplanation of the way in which the Underground Railroad got its\r\nname; but they cannot be trusted in the details of time, place\r\nand occasion. Whatever the manner and date of its suggestion, the\r\ndesignation was generally accepted as an apt title for a mysterious\r\nmeans of transporting fugitive slaves to Canada.\r\n\r\n  [111] The _Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, p. 35.\r\n\r\n  [112] The _Underground Railroad_, pp. 4, 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CROSSING PLACE FOR FUGITIVE SLAVES ON THE OHIO\r\nRIVER, AT STEUBENVILLE, OHIO.\r\n\r\n(From a recent photograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF THE REV. JOHN RANKIN, RIPLEY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nSituated on the top of a high hill, this initial station was readily\r\nfound by runaways from the Kentucky shore opposite.\r\n\r\n(From a recent photograph.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE METHODS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the enactment of the first Fugitive Slave Law, February 12,\r\n1793, the aiding of fugitive slaves became a penal offence. This\r\nmeasure laid a fine of five hundred dollars upon any one harboring\r\nescaped slaves, or preventing their arrest. The provisions of the\r\nlaw were of a character to stimulate resistance to its enforcement.\r\nThe master or his agent was authorized to arrest the runaway,\r\nwherever found; to bring him before a judge of the circuit or the\r\ndistrict court of the United States, or before a local magistrate\r\nwhere the capture was made; and to receive, on the display of\r\nsatisfactory proof, a certificate operating as a full warrant for\r\ntaking the prisoner back to the state from which he had fled. This\r\nsummary method of disposing of cases involving the high question of\r\nhuman liberty was regarded by many persons as unjust; they freely\r\ndenounced it, and, despite the penalty attached, many violated the\r\nlaw. Secrecy was the only safeguard of these persons, as it was\r\nof those they were attempting to succor; hence arose the numerous\r\nartifices employed.\r\n\r\nThe uniform success of the attempts to evade this first Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, and doubtless, also, the general indisposition of\r\nNorthern people to take part in the return of refugees to their\r\nSouthern owners, led, as early as in 1823, to negotiations between\r\nKentucky and the three adjoining states across the Ohio. It is\r\nunnecessary to trace the history of these negotiations, or to point\r\nout the statutes in which the legislative results are recorded. It\r\nis notable that sixteen years elapsed before the legislature of Ohio\r\npassed a law to secure the recovery of slave property, and that the\r\nnew enactment remained on the statute books only four years. The\r\npenalties imposed by this law for advising or for enticing a slave\r\nto leave his master, or for harboring a fugitive, were a fine, not\r\nto exceed five hundred dollars, and, at the discretion of the court,\r\nimprisonment not to exceed sixty days. In addition, the offender was\r\nto be liable in an action at the suit of the party injured.[113] It\r\ncan scarcely be supposed that a state Fugitive Slave Law like this\r\nwould otherwise affect persons that were already engaged in aiding\r\nrunaways than to make them more certain than ever that their cause\r\nwas just.\r\n\r\n  [113] The date of the act is February 26, 1839.\r\n\r\nThe loss of slave property sustained by Southern planters was\r\nnot diminished, and the outcry of the South for a more rigorous\r\nnational law on the subject was by no means hushed. In 1850 Congress\r\nmet the case by substituting for the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793\r\nthe measure called the second Fugitive Slave Law. The penalties\r\nprovided by this law were, of course, more severe than those of the\r\nact of 1793. Any person hindering the claimant from arresting the\r\nfugitive, or attempting the rescue or concealment of the fugitive,\r\nbecame \"subject to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or\r\nimprisonment not exceeding six months,\" and was liable for \"civil\r\ndamages to the party injured by such illegal conduct in the sum of\r\none thousand dollars for each fugitive so lost.\" These provisions\r\nof the new law only added fresh fuel to the fire. The determination\r\nto prevent the recovery of escaped slaves by their owners spread\r\nrapidly among the inhabitants of the free states. Many of these\r\npersons, who had hitherto refrained from acting for or against the\r\nfugitive, were provoked into helping defeat the action of a law\r\ncommanding them \"to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient\r\nexecution\" of a measure that would have set them at the miserable\r\nbusiness of slave-catching. Clay only expressed a wish instead of\r\na fact, when he maintained in 1851 that the law was being executed\r\nin Indiana, Ohio and other states. Another Southern senator was\r\nmuch nearer the truth when he complained of the small number of\r\nrecaptures under the recent act.\r\n\r\nThe risk of suffering severe penalties by violating the Fugitive\r\nSlave laws was less wearing, probably, on abolitionists than was\r\nthe social disdain they brought upon themselves by acknowledging\r\ntheir principles. During a generation or more they were in a\r\nminority in many communities, and were forced to submit to the\r\ntaunts and insults of persons that did not distinguish between\r\nabolition of slavery and fusion of the white and the black races.\r\n\"Black abolitionist,\" \"niggerite,\" \"amalgamationist\" and \"nigger\r\nthief\" were convenient epithets in the mouths of pro-slavery\r\nchampions in many Northern neighborhoods. The statement was not\r\nuncommonly made about those suspected of harboring slaves, that\r\nthey did so from motives of thrift and gain. It was said that some\r\nunderground helpers made use of the labor of runaways, especially\r\nin harvest-time, as long as it suited their convenience, then\r\non the pretext of danger hurried the negroes off without pay.\r\nUnreasoning malice alone could concoct so absurd an explanation of\r\na philanthropy involving so much cost and risk.[114] Abolitionists\r\nwere often made uncomfortable in their church relations by the\r\nuncomplimentary attentions they received, or by the discovery\r\nthat they were regarded as unwelcome disturbers of the household\r\nof faith.[115] Even the Society of Friends is not above the\r\ncharge of having lost sight, in some quarters, of the precepts\r\nof Anthony Benezet and John Woolman. Uxbridge monthly meeting is\r\nknown to have disowned Abby Kelly because she gave anti-slavery\r\nlectures.[116] The church certificate given to Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nBuffum Chace when she transferred her membership from Swanzey\r\nmonthly meeting to Providence (Rhode Island) monthly meeting was\r\nwithout the acknowledgment usually contained in such certificates\r\nthat the bearer \"was of orderly life and conversation.\"[117] A\r\npopular Hicksite minister of New York City, in commending the\r\nfugitive Thomas Hughes for consenting to return South with his\r\nmaster, said, \"I had a thousand times rather be a slave, and spend\r\nmy days with slaveholders, than to dwell in companionship with\r\nabolitionists.\"[118] In the Methodist Church there came to be\r\nsuch stress of feeling between the abolitionists and the other\r\nmembers, that in many places the former withdrew and organized\r\nlittle congregations apart, under the denominational name, Wesleyan\r\nMethodist. The truth is, the mass of the people of the free states\r\nwere by no means abolitionists; they cherished an intense prejudice\r\nagainst the negro, and permitted it to extend to all anti-slavery\r\nadvocates. They were willing to let slavery alone, and desired that\r\nothers should let it alone. In the Western states the character\r\nof public sentiment is evidenced by the fact that generally the\r\npolitical party considered to be most favorable to slavery could\r\ncommand a majority, and \"black laws\" were framed at the behest of\r\nSouthern politicians for the purpose of making residence in the\r\nNorthern states a disagreeable thing for the negro.[119]\r\n\r\n  [114] See an article entitled \"An Underground Railway,\" by Robert\r\n  W.

In such\r\ncases it did not always follow that the discovery brought ruin upon\r\nthe head of the offender, even when the discoverer was a person of\r\npro-slavery views. Nevertheless, accidents of the kind described\r\nserved to fasten the suspicions of a locality upon the offender.\r\nGravner and Hannah Marsh, Quakers, living near Downington, in\r\nChester County, Pennsylvania, became known to their pro-slavery\r\nneighbors as agents on the Underground Road. These neighbors were\r\nnot disposed to inform against them, although one woman, intent on\r\nfinding out how many slaves they aided in a year, with much watching\r\ncounted sixty.[120] The Rev. John Cross, a Presbyterian minister\r\nliving in Elba Township, Knox County, Illinois, about the year\r\n1840, had neighbors that insisted on his answering to the law for\r\nthe help he gave to some fugitives. Mr. Cross made no secret of his\r\nprinciples and accordingly became game for his enemies. One of these\r\nwas Jacob Kightlinger, who observed a wagon-load of negroes being\r\ntaken in the direction of Mr. Cross's house. Investigation by Mr.\r\nKightlinger and several of his friends proved their suspicions to\r\nbe true, and by their action Mr. Cross was indicted for harboring\r\nfugitive slaves.[121]\r\n\r\n  [120] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, p. 139.\r\n\r\n  [121] _History of Knox County, Ill._, pp. 213, 214. Mr.\r\n  Kightlinger's account of this affair is published under his own\r\n  name.\r\n\r\nParties in pursuit of fugitives were compelled to make careful\r\nand often long-continued search to find traces of their wayfaring\r\nchattels. During such missions they were, of course, inquisitive\r\nand vigilant, and when circumstances seemed to warrant it, they\r\nset men to watch the premises of the persons most suspicioned, and\r\nto report any mysterious actions occurring within the district\r\npatrolled. The houses of many noted abolitionists along the Ohio\r\nRiver were frequently under the surveillance of slave-hunters. It\r\nwas not a rare thing that towns and villages in regions adjacent to\r\nthe Southern states were terrorized by crowds of roughs eager to\r\nfind the hiding-places of slaves, recently missed by masters bent on\r\ntheir recovery. The following extracts from a letter written by Mr.\r\nWilliam Steel to Mr. David Putnam, Jr., of Point Harmar, Ohio, will\r\nshow the methods practised by slave-hunters when in eager pursuit of\r\nfugitives:--\r\n\r\n  WOODSFIELD, MONROE CO., O.\r\n\r\n  Sept. 5, 1843.\r\n\r\n     MR. DAVID PUTNAM, JR.:\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_,--I received yours of the 26th ult, and was very\r\n     glad to hear from it that Stephen Quixot had such good luck\r\n     in getting his family from Virginia, but we began to be very\r\n     uneasy about them as we did not hear from them again until last\r\n     Saturday, ... we then heard they were on the route leading\r\n     through Summerfield, but that the route from there to Somerton\r\n     was so closely watched both day and night for some time past\r\n     on account of the human cattle that have lately escaped from\r\n     Virginia, that they could not proceed farther on that route.\r\n     So we made an arrangement with the Summerfield friends to meet\r\n     them on Sunday evening about ten miles west of this and bring\r\n     them on to this route ... the abolitionists of the west part of\r\n     this county have had very difficult work in getting them all off\r\n     without being caught, as the whole of that part of the country\r\n     has been filled with Southern blood hounds upon their track, and\r\n     some of the abolitionists' houses have been watched day and\r\n     night for several days in succession. This evening a company of\r\n     eight Virginia hounds passed through this place north on the\r\n     hunt of some of their two-legged chattels.... Since writing the\r\n     above I have understood that something near twenty Virginians\r\n     including the eight above mentioned have just passed through\r\n     town on their way to the Somerton neighborhood, but I do not\r\n     think they will get much information about their lost chattels\r\n     there....\r\n\r\n  Yours for the Slave,\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM STEEL.[122]\r\n\r\n  [122] The original letter is in the possession of the author of\r\n  this book.\r\n\r\nA case that well illustrates the method of search employed by\r\npursuing parties is that of the escape of the Nuckolls slaves\r\nthrough Iowa, the incidents of which are still vivid in the memories\r\nof some that witnessed them. Mr. Nuckolls, of Nebraska City,\r\nNebraska, lost two slave-girls in December, 1858. He instituted\r\nsearch for them in Tabor, an abolitionist centre, and did not\r\nneglect to guard the crossings of two streams in the vicinity,\r\nSilver Creek and the Nishnabotna River. As the slaves had been\r\npromptly despatched to Chicago, this search availed him nothing. A\r\nsecond and more thorough hunt was decided on, and the aid of a score\r\nor more fellows was secured. These men made entrance into houses by\r\nforce and violence, when bravado failed to gain them admission.[123]\r\nAt one house where the remonstrance against intrusion was unusually\r\nstrong the person remonstrating was struck over the head and injured\r\nfor life. The outcome of the whole affair was that Mr. Nuckolls had\r\nsome ten thousand dollars to pay in damages and costs, and, after\r\nall, failed to recover his slaves.[124]\r\n\r\n  [123] The _Tabor Beacon_, 1890, 1891, Chapter XXI of a series\r\n  of articles by the Rev. John Todd, on \"The Early Settlement\r\n  and Growth of Western Iowa.\" Mr. Todd was one of the early\r\n  settlers of western Iowa. The letters were received from his\r\n  son, Professor James E. Todd, of the University of South Dakota,\r\n  Vermillion, S. Dak.\r\n\r\n  [124] Letter of Mr. Sturgis Williams, Percival, Ia., 1894. Mr.\r\n  Williams was also one of the pioneers of western Iowa.\r\n\r\nMany were the inducements to practise espionage on abolitionists.\r\nLarge sums were offered for the capture of fugitives, and rewards\r\nwere offered also for the arrest and delivery south of Mason\r\nand Dixon's line of certain abolitionists, who were well-enough\r\nknown to have the hatred of many Southerners. \"At an anti-slavery\r\nmeeting of the citizens of Sardinia and vicinity, held on November\r\n21, 1838, a committee of respectable citizens presented a report,\r\naccompanied with affidavits in support of its declarations, stating\r\nthat for more than a year past there had been an unusual degree of\r\nhatred manifested by the slave-hunters and slaveholders towards\r\nthe abolitionists of Brown County, and that rewards varying from\r\n$500 to $2,500 had been repeatedly offered by different persons\r\nfor the abduction or assassination of the Rev. John B. Mahan; and\r\nrewards had also been offered for Amos Pettijohn, William A. Frazier\r\nand Dr. Isaac M. Beck, of Sardinia, the Rev. John Rankin and Dr.\r\nAlexander Campbell, of Ripley, William McCoy, of Russellville,\r\nand citizens of Adams County.\"[125] A resolution was offered in\r\nthe Maryland Legislature, in January, 1860, proposing a reward\r\nfor the arrest of Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington, for \"stealing\"\r\nslaves.[126] It is perhaps an evidence of the extraordinary caution\r\nand shrewdness employed by managers of the Road generally that so\r\nmany of them escaped without suffering the penalties of the law or\r\nthe inflictions of private vengeance.\r\n\r\n  [125] _History of Brown County, Ohio_, p. 314.\r\n\r\n  [126] _The New Reign of Terror in the Slaveholding States_, for\r\n  1859-1860 (_Anti-Slavery Tracts_, No. 4, New Series), pp. 49, 50.\r\n\r\nSlave-owners occasionally tried to find out the secrets of an\r\nunderground station or of a route by visiting various localities in\r\ndisguise. A Kentucky slaveholder clad in the Friends' peculiar garb\r\nwent to the house of John Charles, a Quaker of Richmond, Indiana,\r\nand meeting a son of Mr. Charles, accosted him with the words,\r\n\"Well, sir, my little mannie, hasn't thee father gone to Canada\r\nwith some niggers?\" Young Charles quickly perceived the disguise,\r\nand pointing his finger at the man declared him to be a \"wolf in\r\nsheep's clothing.\"[127] About the year 1840 there came into Cass\r\nCounty, Indiana, a man from Kentucky by the name of Carpenter, who\r\nprofessed to be an anti-slavery lecturer and an agent for certain\r\nanti-slavery papers. He visited the abolitionists and seemed zealous\r\nin the cause. In this way he learned the whereabouts of seven\r\nfugitives that had arrived in the neighborhood from Kentucky a few\r\nweeks before. He sent word to their masters, and in due time they\r\nwere all seized, but had not been taken far before the neighborhood\r\nwas aroused, masters and victims were overtaken and carried to the\r\ncounty-seat, a trial was procured, and the slaves were again set\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n  [127] Letter of Mrs. Mary C. Thorne, Selma, Clark Co., O., March\r\n  3, 1892. John Charles was an uncle of Mrs. Thorne.\r\n\r\nThus the penalties of the law, the contempt of neighbors, and the\r\nespionage of persons interested in returning fugitives to bondage\r\nmade secrecy necessary in the service of the Underground Railroad.\r\n\r\nNight was the only time, of course, in which the fugitive and his\r\nhelpers could feel themselves even partially secure. Probably most\r\nslaves that started for Canada had learned to know the north star,\r\nand to many of these superstitious persons its light seemed the\r\nenduring witness of the divine interest in their deliverance. When\r\nclouds obscured the stars they had recourse, perhaps, to such bits\r\nof homely knowledge as, that in forests the trunks of trees are\r\ncommonly moss-grown on their north sides. In Kentucky and western\r\nVirginia many fugitives were guided to free soil by the tributaries\r\nof the Ohio; while in central and eastern Virginia the ranges of\r\nthe Appalachian chain marked the direction to be taken. After\r\nreaching the initial station of some line of Underground Road the\r\nfugitive found himself provided with such accommodations for rest\r\nand refreshment as circumstances would allow; and after an interval\r\nof a day or more he was conveyed, usually in the night, to the house\r\nof the next friend. Sometimes, however, when a guide was thought to\r\nbe unnecessary the fugitive was sent on foot to the next station,\r\nfull and minute instructions for finding it having been given\r\nhim. The faltering step, and the light, uncertain rapping of the\r\nfugitive at the door, was quickly recognized by the family within,\r\nand the stranger was admitted with a welcome at once sincere and\r\nsubdued. There was a suppressed stir in the house while the fire\r\nwas building and food preparing; and after the hunger and chill\r\nof the wayfarer had been dispelled, he was provided with a bed in\r\nsome out-of-the-way part of the house, or under the hay in the\r\nbarn loft, according to the degree of danger. Often a household was\r\nawakened to find a company of five or more negroes at the door. The\r\narrival of such a company was sometimes announced beforehand by\r\nspecial messenger.\r\n\r\nThat the amount of time taken from the hours of sleep by underground\r\nservice was no small item may be seen from the following record\r\ncovering the last half of August, 1843. The record or memorandum is\r\nthat of Mr. David Putnam, Jr., of Point Harmar, Ohio, and is given\r\nwith all the abbreviations:\r\n\r\n  Aug.             13/43  Sunday Morn.     2 o'clock arrived\r\n                          Sunday Eve.      8-1/2 \"  departed for B.\r\n                   16     Wednesday Morn.  2     \"  arrived\r\n                   20     Sunday eve.     10     \"  departed for N.\r\n  Wife & children  21     Monday morn.     2     \"  arrived from B.\r\n                          Monday eve.     10     \"  left for Mr. H.\r\n                   22     Tuesday eve.    11     \"  left for W.\r\n  A.

J.    28     Monday morn.     1     \"  arrived left\r\n                                                    2 o'clock.[128]\r\n\r\n  [128] The original memorandum is written in pencil on a letter\r\n  received by Mr. Putnam from Mr. John Stone, of Belpre, O., in\r\n  Aug., 1843. The contents of this letter, or message, is given on\r\n  page 57. The original is in possession of the author.\r\n\r\nThis is plainly a schedule of arriving and departing \"trains\" on\r\nthe Underground Road. It is noticeable that the schedule contains\r\nno description, numerical or otherwise, of the parties coming and\r\ngoing; nor does it indicate, except by initial, to what places or\r\npersons the parties were despatched; further, it does not indicate\r\nwhether Mr. Putnam accompanied them or not. It does, however, give\r\nus a clue to the amount of night service that was done at a station\r\nof average activity on the Ohio River as early as the year 1843.\r\nThe demands upon operators increased, we know, from this time on\r\ntill 1860. The memorandum also shows the variation in the length of\r\ntime during which different companies of fugitives were detained\r\nat a station; thus, the first fugitive, or company of fugitives,\r\nas the case may have been, departed on the evening of the day of\r\narrival; the second party was kept in concealment from Wednesday\r\nmorning until the Sunday night next following before it was sent on\r\nits way; the third party seems to have been divided, one section\r\nbeing forwarded the night of the day of arrival, the other the next\r\nnight following; in the case of the last company there seems to have\r\nexisted some especial reason for haste, and we find it hurried away\r\nat two o'clock in the morning, after only an hour's intermission\r\nfor rest and refreshment. The memorandum of night service at the\r\nPutnam station may be regarded as fairly representative of the night\r\nservice at many other posts or stations throughout Ohio and the\r\nadjoining states.\r\n\r\nMuch of the communication relating to fugitive slaves was had\r\nin guarded language. Special signals, whispered conversations,\r\npasswords, messages couched in figurative phrases, were the common\r\nmodes of conveying information about underground passengers,\r\nor about parties in pursuit of fugitives. These modes of\r\ncommunication constituted what abolitionists knew as the \"grape-vine\r\ntelegraph.\"[129] The signals employed were of various kinds, and\r\nwere local in usage. Fugitives crossing the Ohio River in the\r\nvicinity of Parkersburg, in western Virginia, were sometimes\r\nannounced at stations near the river by their guides by a shrill\r\ntremolo-call like that of the owl. Colonel John Stone and Mr.\r\nDavid Putnam, Jr., of Marietta, Ohio, made frequent use of this\r\nsignal.[130] Different neighborhoods had their peculiar combinations\r\nof knocks or raps to be made upon the door or window of a station\r\nwhen fugitives were awaiting admission. In Harrison County, Ohio,\r\naround Cadiz, one of the recognized signals was three distinct but\r\nsubdued knocks. To the inquiry, \"Who's there?\" the reply was, \"A\r\nfriend with friends.\"[131] Passwords were used on some sections\r\nof the Road. The agents at York in southeastern Pennsylvania made\r\nuse of them, and William Yokum, a constable of the town, who was\r\nkindly disposed towards runaways, was able to be most helpful in\r\ntimes of emergency by his knowledge of the watchwords, one of which\r\nwas \"William Penn.\"[132] Messages couched in figurative language\r\nwere often sent. The following note, written by Mr. John Stone, of\r\nBelpre, Ohio, in August, 1843, is a good example:--\r\n\r\n  BELPRE Friday Morning\r\n\r\n     DAVID PUTNAM\r\n\r\n     Business is aranged for Saturday night be on the lookout and if\r\n     practicable let a cariage come & meet the cara_wan_\r\n\r\n  J S[133]\r\n\r\n  [129] The _Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, p. 20; also letter of\r\n  S.

Miss Martha Putnam says she has heard her\r\n  father make the \"hoot-owl\" call hundreds of times. General R.\r\n  R. Dawes designates this call the \"river signal.\" \"When I was a\r\n  boy of eight,\" he says, \"I was visiting my grandfather, Judge\r\n  Ephraim Cutler. The place was called Constitution. Somehow, in\r\n  the night I was wakened up, and a wagon came down over the hill\r\n  to the river. Then a call was given, a hoot-owl call, and this\r\n  was answered by a similar one from the other side; then a boat\r\n  went out and brought over the crowd.

Judge\r\nThomas Lee, of the Western Reserve, was one of this class, as the\r\nfollowing letter to Mr. Putnam, of Point Harmar, will show:--\r\n\r\n  CADIZ, OHIO, March 17th, 1847.\r\n\r\n     MR. DAVID PUTNAM,\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_:--I understand you are a friend to the poor and are\r\n     willing to obey the heavenly mandate, \"Hide the outcasts, betray\r\n     not him that wandereth.\" Believing this, and at the request of\r\n     Stephen Fairfax (who has been permitted in divine providence to\r\n     enjoy for a few days the kind of liberty which Ohio gives to the\r\n     man of colour), I would be glad if you could find out and let me\r\n     know by letter what are the prospects if any and the probable\r\n     time when, the balance of the family will make the same effort\r\n     to obtain their inalienable right to life, liberty, and the\r\n     pursuit of happiness. Their friends who have gone north are very\r\n     anxious to have them follow, as they think it much better to\r\n     work for eight or ten dollars per month than to work for nothing.\r\n\r\n     Yours in behalf of the millions of poor, opprest and downtrodden\r\n     in our land.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS LEE.\r\n\r\nIn the conveyance of fugitives from station to station there existed\r\nall the variety of method one would expect to find. In the early\r\ndays of the Underground Road the fugitives were generally men. It\r\nwas scarcely thought necessary to send a guide with them unless some\r\nspecial reason for so doing existed. They were, therefore, commonly\r\ngiven such directions as they needed and left to their own devices.\r\nAs the number of refugees increased, and women and children were\r\nmore frequently seen upon the Road, and pursuit was more common,\r\nthe practice of transporting fugitives on horseback, or by vehicle,\r\nwas introduced. The steam railroad was a new means furnished to\r\nabolitionists by the progress of the times, and used by them with\r\ngreater or less frequency as circumstances required, and when the\r\nsafety of passengers would not be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nWhen fugitive travellers afoot or on horseback found themselves\r\npursued, safety lay in flight, unless indeed the company was large\r\nenough, courageous enough, and sufficiently well armed to give\r\nbattle. The safety of fugitives while travelling by conveyance lay\r\nmainly in their concealment, and many were the stratagems employed.\r\nCharacteristic of the service of the Underground Railroad were\r\nthe covered wagons, closed carriages and deep-bedded farm-wagons\r\nthat hid the passengers. There are those living who remember\r\nspecial day-coaches of more peculiar construction. Abram Allen, a\r\nQuaker of Oakland, Clinton County, Ohio, had a large three-seated\r\nwagon, made for the purpose of carrying fugitives. He called it\r\nthe Liberator. It was curtained all around, would hold eight or\r\nten persons, and had a mechanism with a bell, invented by Mr.\r\nAllen, to record the number of miles travelled.[137] A citizen\r\nof Troy, Ohio, a bookbinder by trade, had a large wagon, built\r\nabout with drawers in such a way as to leave a large hiding-place\r\nin the centre of the wagon-bed. As the bookbinder drove through\r\nthe country he found opportunity to help many a fugitive on his\r\nway to Canada.[138] Horace Holt, of Rutland, Meigs County, Ohio,\r\nsold reeds to his neighbors in southern Ohio. He had a box-bed\r\nwagon with a lid that fastened with a padlock. In this he hauled\r\nhis supply of reeds; it was well understood by a few that he also\r\nhauled fugitive slaves.[139] Joseph Sider, of southern Indiana,\r\nfound his pedler wagon well adapted to the transportation of slaves\r\nfrom Kentucky plantations.[140] William Still gives instances of\r\nnegroes being placed in boxes, and shipped as freight by boat, and\r\nalso by rail, to friends in the North. William Box Peel Jones was\r\nboxed in Baltimore and sent to Philadelphia by way of the Ericsson\r\nline of steamers, being seventeen hours on the way.[141] Henry Box\r\nBrown had the same thrilling and perilous experience. His trip\r\nconsumed twenty-four hours, during which time he was in the care of\r\nthe Adams Express Company in transit from Richmond, Virginia, to\r\nPhiladelphia.[142]\r\n\r\n  [137] Judge R. B.

They sought to divest their excursions\r\nof the air of mystery by seeming to be about legitimate business.\r\nHannah Marsh, of Chester County, Pennsylvania, was in the habit\r\nof taking garden produce to the Philadelphia markets to sell;\r\nwhen, therefore, she sometimes used her covered market-wagon, even\r\nin daytime, to convey fugitives, she attracted no attention, and\r\nmade her trips without molestation.[143] Calvin Fairbank abducted\r\nthe Stanton family, father, mother and six children, from the\r\nneighborhood of Covington, Kentucky, by packing them in a load of\r\nstraw.[144] James W. Torrence, of Northwood, Ohio, together with\r\nsome of his neighbors exported grain, and sometimes feathers, to\r\nSandusky. These products were generally shipped when there were\r\nfugitives to go with the load. As the distance to Sandusky was a\r\nhundred and twenty miles, refugees who happened to profit by this\r\narrangement were saved much time and no small amount of risk in\r\ngetting to their destination.[145] Mr. William I. Bowditch, of\r\nBoston, used a two-horse carryall on one occasion to take a single\r\nfugitive to Concord.[146] Mr. John Weldon and other abolitionists,\r\nof Dwight, Illinois, took negroes to Chicago concealed in wagons\r\nloaded with sacks of bran.[147] Levi Coffin, of Cincinnati, Ohio,\r\nfrequently received large companies for which safe transportation\r\nhad to be supplied. On one occasion a party of twenty-eight\r\nnegroes arrived, towards daylight, in the suburbs of Cincinnati,\r\nfrom Boone County, Kentucky, and it was necessary to send them on\r\nat once. Accordingly at Friend Coffin's suggestion a number of\r\ncarriages were procured, formed into a long funeral-like procession\r\nand started solemnly on the road to Cumminsville.[148] An almost\r\nendless array of incidents similar to these can be given, but enough\r\nhave been recited to illustrate the caution that prevailed in the\r\ntransportation of fugitive slaves toward Canada.\r\n\r\n  [143] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, pp. 138, 139.\r\n\r\n  [144] _The Rev.

Torrence, Northwood, Logan Co.,\r\n  O., Sept. 22, 1894.\r\n\r\n  [146] Letter of William I. Bowditch, Boston, Mass., April 5, 1893.\r\n\r\nThe routes were very far from being straight. They are perhaps best\r\ndescribed by the word zigzag. The exigencies that determined in\r\nwhat direction an escaping slave should go during any particular\r\npart of his journey were, in the nature of the case, always local.\r\nThe ultimate goal was Canada, but a safe passage was of greater\r\nimportance than a quick one. When speed would contribute safety the\r\nguide would make a long trip with his charge, or perhaps resort\r\nto the steam railroad; but under ordinary circumstances, in those\r\nregions where the Underground Railroad was most patronized, a guide\r\nhad almost always a choice between two or more routes; he could, as\r\nseemed best at the time, take the right-hand road to one station, or\r\nthe left-hand road to another. In truth, the underground paths in\r\nthese regions formed a great and intricate network, and it was in\r\nno small measure because the lines forming the meshes of this great\r\nsystem converged and branched again at so many stations that it was\r\nalmost an impossibility for slave-hunters to trace their negroes\r\nthrough even a single county without finding themselves on the wrong\r\ntrail. It was a common stratagem in times of special emergency to\r\nswitch off travellers from one course to another, or to take them\r\nback on their track and then, after a few days of waiting, send\r\nthem forward again. It is, then, proper to say that zigzag was one\r\nof the regular devices to blind and throw off pursuit. It served\r\nmoreover to avoid unfriendly localities. It seems probable that the\r\ncircuitous land route from Toledo to Detroit was an expedient of\r\nthis sort, for slave-owners and their agents were often known to\r\nbe on the lookout along the direct thoroughfare between the places\r\nnamed. The two routes between Millersburgh and Lodi in northern\r\nOhio are explained by the statement that the most direct route,\r\nthe western one, fell under suspicion for a while, and in the\r\nmeantime a more circuitous path was followed through Holmesville and\r\nSeville.[149]\r\n\r\n  [147] Letter of John Weldon, Dwight, Ill., Nov. 7, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [148] _History of Darke County, Ohio_, p. 332 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  [149] Letter of Thomas L. Smith, Fredericksburg, Wayne Co., O.,\r\n  Oct. 6, 1894.\r\n\r\nDuring the long process by which the slave with the help of friends\r\nwas being transmuted into the freeman he spent much of his time\r\nin concealment. His progress was made in the night-time. When a\r\nstation was reached he was provided with a hiding-place, and he\r\nscarcely left it until his host decided it would be safe for him to\r\ncontinue his journey. The hiding-places the fugitive entered first\r\nand last were as dissimilar as can well be imagined. Slaves that\r\ncrossed the Ohio River at Ripley, and fell into the hands of the\r\nRev. John Rankin, were often concealed in his barn, which is said\r\nto have been provided with a secret cellar for use by the slaves\r\nwhen pursuers approached. The barn of Deacon Jirch Platt at Mendon,\r\nIllinois, was a haven into which many slaves from Missouri were\r\npiloted by way of Quincy. A hazel thicket in Mr. Platt's pasture-lot\r\nwas sometimes resorted to,[150] as was one of his hayricks that\r\nwas hollow and had a blind entrance.[151] Joshua R. Giddings, the\r\nsturdy anti-slavery Congressman from the Western Reserve, had an\r\nout-of-the-way bedroom in one wing of his house at Jefferson, Ohio,\r\nthat was kept in readiness for fugitive slaves.[152] The attic over\r\nthe _Liberator_ office in Boston is said to have been a rendezvous\r\nfor such persons.[153] A station-keeper at Plainfield, Illinois,\r\nhad a woodpile with a room in the centre for a hiding-place.[154]\r\nThe Rev. J. Porter, pastor of a Congregational church at Green Bay,\r\nWisconsin, was asked to furnish a place of hiding for a family of\r\nfugitives, and at his wife's suggestion he put them in the belfry\r\nof his church, where they remained three days before a vessel came\r\nby which they could be safely transported to Canada.[155] Mr. James\r\nM. Westwater and other citizens of Columbus, Ohio, fitted up an\r\nold smoke-house standing on Chestnut Street near Fourth Street as\r\na station of the Underground Railroad.[156] A fugitive reaching\r\nCanton, Washington County, Indiana, was secreted for a while in a\r\nlow place in a thick, dark woods; and afterwards in a rail pen\r\ncovered with straw.[157] Eli F. Brown, of Amesville, Athens County,\r\nOhio, writes: \"I built an addition to my house in which I had a room\r\nwith its partition in pannels. One pannel could be raised about a\r\nhalf inch and then slid back, so as to permit a man to enter the\r\nroom. When the pannel was in place it appeared like its fellows....\r\nIn the abutment of Zanesville bridge on the Putnam side there was\r\na place of concealment prepared.\"[158] \"Conductors\" Levi Coffin,\r\nEdward Harwood, and W. H. Brisbane, of Cincinnati, Ohio, had a\r\nnumber of hiding-places for slaves. \"One was in the dark cellar of\r\nCoffin's store; another was at Mr. Coffin's out-of-the-way residence\r\nbetween Avondale and Walnut Hills; another was a dark sub-cellar\r\nunder the rear part of Dr. Bailey's residence, corner of Sixth\r\nand College Streets.\"[159] The gallery of the old First Church at\r\nGalesburg, Illinois, was utilized as a place of concealment for\r\nrefugees by certain members of that church.[160] Gabe N. Johnson, a\r\ncolored man of Ironton, on the Ohio River, sometimes hid fugitives\r\nin a coal-bank back of his house.[161] This list of illustrations\r\ncould be almost indefinitely continued. A sufficient number has been\r\ngiven to show the ingenuity necessarily used to secure safety.\r\n\r\n  [150] Letter of J. E. Platt, Guthrie, Ok., March 28, 1896.

Johnson, Ironton, O., Sept. 30,\r\n  1894.\r\n\r\nIn the transit from station to station some simple disguise was\r\noften assumed. Thomas Garrett, a Quaker of Wilmington, Delaware,\r\nkept a quantity of garden tools on hand for this purpose. He\r\nsometimes gave a man a scythe, rake, or some other implement to\r\ncarry through town. Having reached a certain bridge on the way to\r\nthe next station, the pretending laborer concealed his tool under\r\nit, as he had been directed, and journeyed on. Later the tool was\r\ntaken back to Mr. Garrett's to be used for a similar purpose.[162]\r\nValentine Nicholson, a station-keeper at Harveysburg, Warren\r\nCounty, Ohio, concealed the identity of a fugitive, a mulatto,\r\nwho was known to be pursued, by blacking his face and hands with\r\nburnt cork.[163] Slight disguises like these were probably not used\r\nas often as more elaborate ones. The Rev. Calvin Fairbank, and\r\nJohn Fairfield, the Virginian, who abducted many slaves from the\r\nSouth, resorted frequently to this means of securing the safety of\r\ntheir followers. Mr. Fairbank tells us that he piloted slave-girls\r\nattired in the finery of ladies, men and boys tricked out as\r\ngentlemen and the servants of gentlemen; and that sometimes he found\r\nit necessary to require his followers to don the garments of the\r\nopposite sex.[164] In May, 1843, Mr. Fairbank went to Arkansas for\r\nthe purpose of rescuing William Minnis from bondage. He found that\r\nthe slave was a young man of light complexion and prepossessing\r\nappearance, and that he closely resembled a gentleman living in the\r\nvicinity of Little Rock. Minnis was, therefore, fitted out with the\r\nnecessary wig, beard and moustache, and clothes like those of his\r\nmodel; he was quickly drilled in the deportment of his assumed rank,\r\nand, as the test proved, he sustained himself well in his part. On\r\nboarding the boat that was to carry him to freedom he discovered his\r\nowner, Mr. Brennan, but so effectual was the slave's make-up that\r\nthe master failed to penetrate the disguise.[165]\r\n\r\n  [162] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, p. 242.\r\n\r\n  [163] Letter of Valentine Nicholson, Indianapolis, Ind., Sept.\r\n  10, 1892.\r\n\r\n  [164] _The Rev.

The nigger-catchers became so watchful that she\r\ncould not be moved for several days. In fact, some of them were\r\nnearly always at the house either on some pretended business or\r\nmaking social visits. I do not think that the house was searched,\r\nor they would surely have found her, as during all this time she\r\nremained in the garret over the old log kitchen, where the fugitives\r\nwere usually kept when there was danger. Her owner, a man from New\r\nOrleans, had just bought her in Louisville, and he had traced her\r\nsurely to this place; she had not struck the Underground before, but\r\nhad made her way alone this far, and as they got no trace of her\r\nbeyond here they returned and doubled the watches on Doherty and\r\nmy father. But at length a day came, or a night rather, when she\r\nwas led safely out through the gardens to the house of a colored\r\nman named Patterson. There she was rigged out in as fine a costume\r\nof silk and ribbons as it was possible to procure at that time,\r\nand was furnished with a white baby borrowed for the occasion, and\r\naccompanied by one of the Patterson girls as servant and nurse.\"\r\nThus disguised, the lady boarded the train at the station. But what\r\nmust have been her feelings to find her master already in the same\r\ncar; he was setting out to watch for her at the end of the line.\r\nShe kept her courage, and when they reached Detroit she went aboard\r\nthe ferry-boat for Canada; her pretended nurse returned to shore\r\nwith the borrowed baby; and as the gang-plank was being raised, the\r\nyoung slave-woman on the boat removed her veil that she might bid\r\nher owner good-by. The master's display of anger as he gazed at the\r\ndeparting boat was as real as the situation was gratifying to his\r\nformer slave and amusing to the bystanders.[166]\r\n\r\n  [166] Letter from Mr. Sidney Speed, Crawfordsville, Ind., March\r\n  6, 1896.\r\n\r\nJohn Fairfield, the Virginian, depended largely on disguises in\r\nseveral of his abducting exploits. At one time he was asked by a\r\nnumber of Canadian refugees to help some of their relatives to\r\nthe North, and when he found that many of them had very light\r\ncomplexions, he decided to send them to Canada disguised as white\r\npersons. Having secured for them the requisite wigs and powder, he\r\nwas gratified with the transformation in appearance they were able\r\nto effect. He therefore secured tickets for his party, and placed\r\nthem aboard a night train for Harrisburg, where they were met by\r\na person who accompanied them to Cleveland and saw them take boat\r\nfor Detroit. Later Fairfield succeeded in aiding other companies of\r\nslaves to escape from Washington and Harper's Ferry by resorting\r\nto similar means.[167] Among the Quakers the woman's costume was a\r\nfavorite disguise for fugitives. No one attired in it was likely to\r\nbe in the least degree suspicioned of being anything else than what\r\nthe garb proclaimed. The veiled bonnet also was peculiarly adapted\r\nto conceal the features of the person disguised.[168] One incident\r\nwill suffice to show the utility of the Quaker costume. One evening\r\nJoseph G. Walker, a Quaker of Wilmington, Delaware, was appealed\r\nto by a slave-woman, who was closely pursued. She was permitted to\r\nenter Mr. Walker's house, and a few minutes later, in the gown and\r\nbonnet of Mrs. Walker, she passed out of the front door leaning upon\r\nthe arm of the shrewd Quaker.[169]\r\n\r\n  [167] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, pp. 439-442.\r\n\r\n  [168] M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 61.\r\n\r\n  [169] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, p. 244.\r\n\r\nIt is quite apparent that the Underground Railroad was not a formal\r\norganization with officers of different ranks, a regular membership,\r\nand a treasury from which to meet expenses. A terminology, it is\r\ntrue, sprang up in connection with the work of the Road, and one\r\nhears of station-keepers, agents, conductors, and even presidents of\r\nthe Underground Railroad; but these titles were figurative terms,\r\nborrowed with other expressions from the convenient vocabulary of\r\nsteam railways; and while they were useful among abolitionists to\r\nsave circumlocution, they commended themselves to the friends of the\r\nslave by helping to mystify the minds of the public. The need of\r\norganization was not felt except in a few localities. It was only in\r\ntowns and cities that the distinctions of \"managers,\" \"contributing\r\nmembers,\" and \"agents\" began to develop in any significant way, and\r\neven in the case of these places the distinctions must not be pushed\r\nfar, for they indicate merely that certain men by their sagacious\r\nactivity came to be called \"managers,\" while others less bold, the\r\ncontributing members, were willing to give money towards defraying\r\nthe expenses of some trusty person, the agent, who would run the\r\nrisk of piloting fugitives.\r\n\r\nThe first reference to an organization devoted to the business of\r\naiding fugitive slaves occurs in a letter of George Washington,\r\nbearing date May 12, 1786. Washington speaks of a \"society of\r\nQuakers in the city [Philadelphia], formed for such purposes....\"[170]\r\nWe have no means of knowing how this body conducted its work, nor\r\nhow long it continued to exist. It is sometimes stated that the\r\nformal organization of the Underground Road took place in 1838,\r\nbut this is not an accurate statement. An organized society of the\r\nUnderground Railroad was formed in Philadelphia about the year\r\n1838. Mr. Robert Purvis, who was the president, has called this\r\nbody the first of its kind, but this may be doubted in view of the\r\nquotation from Washington's letter above cited. The character of\r\nthe organization appears from the following account of its methods\r\ngiven by Mr. Purvis:[171] \"The funds for carrying on this enterprise\r\nwere raised from our anti-slavery friends, _as the cases came\r\nup_,\"[172] and their needs demanded it; for many of the fugitives\r\nrequired no other help than advice and direction how to proceed.\r\nTo the late Daniel Neall, the society was greatly indebted for his\r\ngenerous gifts, as well as for his encouraging words and fearless\r\nindependence.... The most efficient helpers or agents we had, were\r\ntwo market-women, who lived in Baltimore....\r\n\r\n  [170] Spark's _Washington_, IX, 158, quoted in _Quakers of\r\n  Pennsylvania_, by Dr. A. C. Applegarth, _Johns Hopkins Studies_,\r\n  X, 463.\r\n\r\n  [171] The letter from which this quotation is made will be found\r\n  in _Underground Railroad_, by R. C. Smedley, pp. 355, 356.\r\n\r\n  [172] The italics are my own.\r\n\r\n\"Another most effective worker was a son of a slaveholder, who lived\r\nat Newberne, S.C. Through his agency, the slaves were forwarded\r\nby placing them on vessels.... Having the address of the active\r\nmembers of the committee, they were enabled to find us, when not\r\naccompanied by our agents.... The fugitives were distributed among\r\nthe members of the society, but most of them were received at my\r\nhouse in Philadelphia, where ... I caused a place to be constructed\r\nunderneath a room, which could only be entered by a trap-door in the\r\nfloor....\"\r\n\r\nThis account shows clearly that the organization of 1838 was\r\nlimited; and while it was officered with a president, secretary\r\nand committee, and had helpers at a distance called agents, it\r\ncan scarcely be said that the plan of action of the society was\r\ndifferent in essential points from that which developed without\r\nthe formality of election of officers in many underground centres\r\nthroughout the Northern states. Levi Coffin, by his devotion to the\r\ncause of the fugitive from boyhood to old age, gained the title\r\nof President of the Underground Railroad,[173] but he was not\r\nat the head of a formal organization. In northeastern Illinois,\r\nPeter Stewart, a prosperous citizen of Wilmington, who was a very\r\nactive worker in the cause, was sometimes called President of the\r\nUnderground Railroad,[174] but here again the distinction seems\r\nto have been complimentary and figurative. In truth the work was\r\neverywhere spontaneous, and its character was such that organization\r\ncould have added little or no efficiency. Unfaltering confidence\r\namong members of neighboring stations served better than a code\r\nof rules; special messengers sent on the spur of the moment took\r\nthe place of conferences held at stated seasons; supplies gathered\r\nprivately as they were needed sufficed instead of regular dues; and,\r\nin general, the decision and sagacity of the individual was required\r\nrather than the less rapid efforts of an organization.\r\n\r\n  [173] Howe, _Historical Collections of Ohio_, Vol. II, pp. 103,\r\n  104; see also the _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_.\r\n\r\n  [174] George H. Woodruff, _History of Will County, Illinois_, p.\r\n  268.\r\n\r\nIn a few centres where the amount of secret service to be done\r\nwas large, a slight specialization of work is to be noticed. This\r\ndivision of labor consisted in the employment of a regular conductor\r\nor agent at these points to manage the work of transportation of\r\npassengers to points farther north; while the station-keepers\r\nattended more closely to the work of receiving and caring for the\r\nnew arrivals. The special conductors chosen were men thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the different routes of their respective\r\nneighborhoods. At Mechanicsburg, Champaign County, Ohio, Udney\r\nHyde, a fearless and well-known citizen, acted as agent between the\r\nlocal stations of J. R. Ware and Levi Rathbun, and stations to the\r\nnortheast as far as the Alum Creek Quaker Settlement, a distance of\r\nforty miles.[175] The stations at Mechanicsburg were among the most\r\nwidely known in central and southern Ohio. They received fugitives\r\nfrom at least three regular routes, and doubtless had \"switch\r\nconnections\" with other lines. Passengers were taken northward over\r\none of the three, perhaps four roads, and as one or two of these\r\nlay through pro-slavery neighborhoods a brave and experienced agent\r\nwas almost indispensable. George W. S. Lucas, a colored man of\r\nSalem, Columbiana County, Ohio, made frequent trips with the closed\r\ncarriage of Philip Evans, between Barnesville, New Philadelphia and\r\nCadiz, and two stations, Ashtabula and Painesville, on the shore of\r\nLake Erie. Occasionally Mr. Lucas conducted parties to Cleveland\r\nand Sandusky and Toledo, but in such cases he went on foot or by\r\nstage.[176] His trips were sometimes a hundred miles and more in\r\nlength. George L. Burroughes, a colored man of Cairo, Illinois,\r\nbecame an agent for the Underground Road in 1857, while acting as\r\nporter of a sleeping-car running on the Illinois Central Railroad\r\nbetween Cairo and Chicago.[177] At Albany, New York, Stephen Meyers,\r\na negro, was an agent of the Underground Road for a wide extent of\r\nterritory.[178] At Detroit there were several colored agents; among\r\nthem George De Baptiste and George Dolarson.[179]\r\n\r\n  [175] Conversation with J. R. Ware, and with the daughter of Mr.\r\n  Hyde, Mrs. Amanda Shepherd, Mechanicsburg, O., Sept. 7, 1895;\r\n  conversation with Major Joseph C.

Citizens of Salem referred to him\r\n  as a reliable source of information.\r\n\r\n  [177] Letter from George L. Burroughes, Cairo, Ill., Jan. 6,\r\n  1896. Mr. Burroughes said that Mr. Robert Delany, a friend from\r\n  Canada, proposed to him that they both take an agency for the\r\n  Underground Railroad. Delany took the Rock Island route and\r\n  Burroughes the Cairo route.\r\n\r\n  [178] Letter of Martin I.

W. Finney, Detroit, Mich., July\r\n  27, 1897.\r\n\r\nThe slight approach to organization manifest in some centres in the\r\ndivision of labor between station-keepers and special agents or\r\nconductors was caused by the large number of fugitives arriving at\r\nthese points, and the extreme caution necessary. When, at length,\r\nindignation was aroused in the minds of Northern abolitionists by\r\nthe passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, September 18, 1850, the\r\ndetermination to resist this measure displayed itself in certain\r\nlocalities in the formation of vigilance committees. Theodore Parker\r\nexplains that it was in consequence of the enactment of this measure\r\nthat \"people held indignant meetings, and organized committees of\r\nvigilance whose duty was to prevent a fugitive from being arrested,\r\nif possible, or to furnish legal aid, and raise every obstacle to\r\nhis rendition. The vigilance committees,\" he says, \"were also the\r\nemployees of the U. G. R. R. and effectively disposed of many a\r\n_casus belli_ by transferring the disputed chattel to Canada. Money,\r\ntime, wariness, devotedness for months and years, that cannot be\r\ncomputed, and will never be recorded, except, perhaps, in connection\r\nwith cases whose details had peculiar interest, was nobly rendered\r\nby the true anti-slavery men.\"[180] Such committees of vigilance\r\nwere organized in Syracuse, New York, Boston, Springfield and some\r\nof the smaller towns of Massachusetts, in Philadelphia and other\r\nplaces. New York City, like Philadelphia, had a Vigilance Committee\r\nas early as 1838. About this association of the metropolis there is\r\nscarcely any information.[181] We must be content then to confine\r\nour attention to the committees called into existence by the\r\nFugitive Slave Law of 1850.\r\n\r\n  [180] Weiss, _Life and Correspondence of Theodore Parker_, Vol.\r\n  II, pp. 92, 93.\r\n\r\n  [181] Frederick Douglass relates that when he escaped from\r\n  Maryland to New York, in 1838, he was befriended by David\r\n  Ruggles, the secretary of the New York Vigilance Committee; _Life\r\n  of Frederick Douglass_, 1881, p. 205.\r\n\r\nEight days after the enactment of this law citizens of Syracuse, New\r\nYork, issued a call through the newspapers for a public meeting, and\r\non October 4 members of all parties crowded the city-hall to express\r\ntheir censure of the law. The meeting recommended \"the appointment\r\nof a Vigilance Commitee of thirteen citizens, whose duty it shall\r\nbe to see that no person is deprived of his liberty without 'due\r\nprocess of law.' And all good citizens are earnestly requested to\r\naid and sustain them in all needed efforts for the security of\r\nevery person claiming the protection of our laws.\" This committee\r\nwas appointed and an address and resolutions adopted.[182] At an\r\nadjourned meeting held on October 12 the assemblage voted to form\r\nan association, \"pledged to stand by its members in opposing this\r\nlaw, and to share with any of them the pecuniary losses they may\r\nincur under the operation of this law.\" The determination shown\r\nin the organization of these two bodies was well sustained a year\r\nlater when the attempt was made by officers of the law to seize\r\nJerry McHenry as a fugitive slave. The Vigilance Committee decided\r\nto storm the court-house, where the colored man was confined under\r\nguard, and rescue the prisoner. This daring piece of work was\r\nsuccessfully accomplished, and the government never again attempted\r\nto recover any slaves in central New York.[183]\r\n\r\n  [182] The Rev. J. W. Loguen gives the names of the committee in\r\n  his autobiography, p. 396.\r\n\r\n  [183] Samuel J. May, _Recollections of the Anti-Slavery\r\n  Conflict_, pp. 349-364; Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power\r\n  in the United States_, Vol. II, pp. 305, 306.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Vigilance Committee of Syracuse was closely\r\nfollowed by the organization of a similar committee in Boston.\r\nAt a meeting in Faneuil Hall, October 14, 1850, resolutions were\r\nadopted expressing the conviction that no citizen would take part\r\nin reënslaving a fugitive, and pledging protection to the colored\r\nresidents of the city. To make good this pledge a Vigilance\r\nCommittee of fifty was appointed.[184] This body organized by\r\nchoosing a president, treasurer, and secretary, a committee of\r\nfinance, an executive committee, a legal committee and a committee\r\nof special vigilance and alarm. An appeal was then issued to the\r\ncitizens of Boston calling their attention to the arrival of\r\nmany destitute fugitives in Boston, and to the establishment of\r\nan agency for the purpose of securing employment for fugitive\r\napplicants. Gifts of money and clothing were asked for. In response\r\nto a circular sent out by the finance committee to all the churches\r\nin 1851, a sum of about sixteen hundred dollars was raised. That\r\nthere might be coöperation throughout the state notices were sent\r\nto all the towns in Massachusetts urging the formation of local\r\nvigilance committees; and as a result such committees were organized\r\nin some towns.[185]\r\n\r\n  [184] _Ibid._, p. 308. The list of members of the Committee\r\n  of Vigilance given by Austin Bearse, the doorkeeper of the\r\n  Committee, contains two hundred and nine names. Among these are\r\n  A. Bronson Alcott, Edward Atkinson, Henry I. Bowditch, Richard\r\n  H. Dana, Jr., Lewis Hayden, William Lloyd Garrison, Samuel G.\r\n  Howe, Francis Jackson, Ellis Gray Loring, James Russell Lowell,\r\n  Theodore Parker, Edmund Quincy and others of distinction. See pp.\r\n  3, 4, 5, 6, in Mr. Bearse's _Reminiscences of Fugitive-Slave-Law\r\n  Days in Boston_.\r\n\r\n  [185] For much valuable material relating to the Vigilance\r\n  Committee of Boston, see Theodore Parker's _Scrap-Book_, in the\r\n  Boston Public Library.\r\n\r\nThe meeting-place of the Boston Committee was Meionaon Hall in\r\nTremont Temple. Members were notified of an intended meeting\r\npersonally, if possible, by the doorkeeper of the committee, Captain\r\nAustin Bearse.[186] The proceedings of the committee were secret,\r\nand comparatively little is now known about their work. It is,\r\nhowever, known that for ten years the organization was active, and\r\nthat although it was not successful in rescuing Sims and Burns from\r\na hard fate, it nevertheless secured the liberty of more than a\r\nhundred others.[187]\r\n\r\n  [186] Mr. Bearse says: \"There were printed tickets of notice\r\n  which I delivered to each member in person, if possible, of which\r\n  the following copies are specimens:\r\n\r\n  'BOSTON, June 7, 1854.\r\n\r\n  There will be a meeting of the Vigilance Committee at the\r\n  Meionaon (Tremont Temple), on _Thursday evening_, June 8, at\r\n  half-past seven.\r\n\r\n  Pass in by the _Office Entrance_, and through the _Meionaon\r\n  Ante-Room_.\r\n\r\n  THEODORE PARKER, _Chairman of Executive Committees_.'\r\n\r\n  'VIGILANCE COMMITTEE! The members of the Vigilance Committee are\r\n  hereby notified to meet at ---- ----\r\n\r\n  By order of the Committee,\r\n\r\n  A. BEARSE, _Doorkeeper_.'\"\r\n\r\n  --_Reminiscences of Fugitive-Slave-Law Days in Boston_, pp. 15,\r\n  16.\r\n\r\n  [187] _Ibid._, p. 14.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Fugitive Slave Law was passed John Brown visited\r\nSpringfield, Massachusetts, where he had formerly lived. The valley\r\nof the Connecticut had long been a line of underground travel, and\r\ncitizens of Springfield, colored and white, had become identified\r\nwith operations on this line. Brown at once decided that the new\r\nlaw made organization necessary, and he formed, therefore, the\r\nLeague of Gileadites to resist systematically the enforcement of the\r\nlaw. The name of this order was significant in that it contained a\r\nwarning to those of its members that should show themselves cowards.\r\n\"Whosoever is fearful or afraid let him return and depart early from\r\nMount Gilead.\"[188] In the \"Agreement and Rules\" that Brown drafted\r\nfor the order, adopted January 15, 1851, the following directions\r\nfor action were laid down: \"Should one of your number be arrested,\r\nyou must collect together as quickly as possible, so as to outnumber\r\nyour adversaries.... Let no able-bodied man appear on the ground\r\nunequipped, or with his weapons exposed to view.... Your plans must\r\nbe known only to yourselves and with the understanding that all\r\ntraitors must die, wherever caught and proven to be guilty.... Let\r\nthe first blow be the signal for all to engage, ... make clean work\r\nwith your enemies, and be sure you meddle not with any others....\r\nAfter effecting a rescue, if you are assailed, go into the houses of\r\nyour most prominent and influential white friends with your wives,\r\nand that will effectually fasten upon them the suspicion of being\r\nconnected with you, and will compel them to make a common cause with\r\nyou.... You may make a tumult in the court-room where a trial is\r\ngoing on by burning gunpowder freely in paper packages.... But in\r\nsuch case the prisoner will need to take the hint at once and bestir\r\nhimself; and so should his friends improve the opportunity for a\r\ngeneral rush.... Stand by one another, and by your friends, while a\r\ndrop of blood remains; and be hanged, if you must, but tell no tales\r\nout of school. Make no confession.\" By adopting the Agreement and\r\nRules forty-four colored persons constituted themselves \"a branch\r\nof the United States League of Gileadites,\" and agreed \"to have no\r\nofficers except a treasurer and secretary pro tem., until after some\r\ntrial of courage,\" when they could choose officers on the basis of\r\n\"courage, efficiency, and general good conduct.\"[189] Doubtless the\r\nGileadites of Springfield did efficient service, for it appears\r\nthat the importance of the town as a way-station on the Underground\r\nRoad increased after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Bill.[190]\r\n\r\n  [188] Judg. vii. 3; Deut. xx. 8; referred to by Brown in his\r\n  \"Agreement and Rules.\"\r\n\r\n  [189] F. B. Sanborn, in his _Life and Letters of John Brown_, pp.\r\n  125, 126, gives the agreement, rules, and signatures. See also R.\r\n  J.

In a speech made before the meeting that organized\r\nthe new committee, December 2, 1852, Mr. J. Miller McKim, the\r\nsecretary of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, gave the\r\nreasons for establishing a new committee. He said that the old\r\ncommittee \"had become disorganized and scattered, and that for\r\nthe last two or three years the duties of this department had\r\nbeen performed by individuals on their own responsibility, and\r\nsometimes in a very irregular manner.\" It was accordingly decided\r\nto form a new committee, called the General Vigilance Committee,\r\nwith a chairman and treasurer; and within this body an Acting\r\nCommittee of four persons, \"who should have the responsibility of\r\nattending to every case that might require their aid, as well as\r\nthe exclusive authority to raise the funds necessary for their\r\npurpose.\" The General Committee comprised nineteen members, and\r\nhad as its head Mr. Robert Purvis, one of the signers of the\r\nDeclaration of Sentiments of the American Anti-Slavery Society,\r\nand the first president of the old committee. The Acting Committee\r\nhad as its chairman William Still, a colored clerk in the office\r\nof the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and a most energetic\r\nunderground helper. The Philadelphia Vigilance Committee, thus\r\nconstituted, continued intact until Lincoln issued the Emancipation\r\nProclamation.[191] Some insight into the work accomplished by the\r\nActing Committee can be obtained by an examination of the book\r\ncompiled by William Still under the title _Underground Railroad\r\nRecords_. The Acting Committee was required to keep a record of\r\nall its doings. Mr. Still's volume was evidently amassed by the\r\ntranscription of many of the incidents that found their way under\r\nthis order into the archives of the committee. The work was limited\r\nto the assistance of such needy fugitives as came to Philadelphia;\r\nand was not extended, except in rare cases, to inciting slaves to\r\nrun away from their masters, or to aiding them in so doing.[192]\r\n\r\n  [191] Article, \"Meeting to Form a Vigilance Committee,\" in the\r\n  _Pennsylvania Freeman_, Dec. 9, 1852; quoted in _Underground\r\n  Railroad Records_, by William Still, pp. 610-612.\r\n\r\n  [192] Still's _Underground Railroad Records_, p. 177. References\r\n  to the action of the committee of which Mr. Still was chairman\r\n  will be found scattered through the Records. See, for example,\r\n  pp. 70, 98, 102, 131, 150, 162, 173, 176, 204, 224, 274, 275,\r\n  303, 325, 335, 388, 412, 449, 493, 500.\r\n\r\nThe relief of the destitution existing among the wayworn travellers\r\nwas a matter requiring considerable outlay of time and money on\r\nthe part of abolitionists. There was occasionally a fugitive or\r\nfamily of fugitives, that, having better opportunity or possessing\r\ngreater foresight than others, made provision for the journey\r\nand escaped to Canada with little or no dependence on the aid of\r\nunderground operators. Asbury Parker, of Ironton, Ohio, fled from\r\nGreenup County, Kentucky, in 1857, clad in a suit of broadcloth,\r\nalone befitting, as he thought, the dignity of a free man.[193] The\r\nbrother of Anthony Bingey, of Windsor, Ontario, came unexpectedly\r\ninto the possession of five hundred dollars. With this money he\r\ninstructed a friend in Cincinnati to procure a team and wagon to\r\nconvey the family of Bingey to Canada. The company arrived at\r\nSandusky after being only three days on the road.[194]\r\n\r\n  [193] Conversation with Asbury Parker, Ironton, O., Sept. 30,\r\n  1894.\r\n\r\n  [194] Conversation with Anthony Bingey, Windsor, Ont., July 3,\r\n  1895.\r\n\r\nBut the mass of fugitives were thinly clad, and had only such food\r\nas they could forage until they reached the Underground Railroad.\r\nThe arrival of a company at a station would be at once followed by\r\nthe preparation, often at midnight, of a meal for the pilgrims and\r\ntheir guides. It was a common thing for a station to entertain a\r\ncompany of five or six; and companies of twenty-eight or thirty are\r\nnot unheard of. Levi Coffin says, \"The largest company of slaves\r\never seated at our table, at one time, numbered seventeen.\"[195]\r\nDuring one month in the year 1854 or 1855 there were sixty runaways\r\nat the house of Aaron L. Benedict, a station in the Alum Creek\r\nQuaker Settlement in central Ohio. On one occasion twenty sat down\r\nto dinner in Mr. Benedict's house.[196] It will thus be seen that\r\nthe supply of provisions alone was for the average station-keeper no\r\ninconsiderable item of expense, and that it was one involving much\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n  [195] _Reminiscences_, p. 178.\r\n\r\n  [196] Conversation with M.

See also _Underground Railroad_, Smedley, pp. 56,\r\n  136, 142, 174.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for furnishing fugitives with clothing, like much\r\nof the underground work done at the stations, came within the\r\nprovince of the women of the stations. While the noted fugitive,\r\nWilliam Wells Brown, lay sick at the house of his benefactor,\r\nMr. Wells Brown, in southwestern Ohio, the family made him some\r\nclothing, and Mr. Brown purchased him a pair of boots.[197] Women's\r\nanti-slavery societies in many places conducted sewing-circles, as\r\na branch of their work, for the purpose of supplying clothes and\r\nother necessities to fugitives. The Woman's Anti-Slavery Society of\r\nEllington, Chautauqua County, New York, sent a letter to William\r\nStill, November 21, 1859, saying: \"Every year we have sent a box of\r\nclothing, bedding, etc., to the aid of the fugitive, and wishing to\r\nsend it where it would be of the most service, we have it suggested\r\nto us, to send to you the box we have at present. You would confer\r\na favor ... by writing us, ... whether or not it would be more\r\nadvantageous to you than some nearer station....\"[198]\r\n\r\n  [197] _Narrative of William W. Brown, A Fugitive Slave_, written\r\n  by himself, 2d ed., 1848, p. 102.\r\n\r\n  [198] The letter is printed in full, together with other letters,\r\n  in Still's _Underground Railroad Records_, pp. 590, 591.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Anti-Slavery Sewing Society of Cincinnati maintained\r\nan active interest in underground work going on in their city by\r\nsupplying clothing to needy travellers.[199] The Female Anti-Slavery\r\nAssociation of Henry County, Indiana, organized a Committee of\r\nVigilance in 1841 \"to seek out such colored females as are not\r\nsuitably provided for, who may now be, or who shall hereafter\r\ncome, within our limits, and assist them in any way they may deem\r\nexpedient, either by advice or pecuniary means....\"[200]\r\n\r\n  [199] Levi Coffin, _Reminiscences_, p. 316.\r\n\r\n  [200] _Protectionist_, Arnold Buffum, Editor, New Garden, Ind.,\r\n  7th mo., 1st, 1841.\r\n\r\nIn some of the large centres, money as well as clothing and food\r\nwas constantly needed for the proper performance of the underground\r\nwork. Thus, for example, at Cincinnati, Ohio, it was frequently\r\nnecessary to hire carriages in which to convey fugitives out of the\r\ncity to some neighboring station. From time to time as the occasion\r\narose Levi Coffin collected the funds needed for such purposes from\r\nbusiness acquaintances. He called these contributors \"stock-holders\"\r\nin the Underground Railroad.[201] After steam railroads became\r\nincorporated in the underground system money was required at\r\ndifferent points to purchase tickets for fugitives. The Vigilance\r\nCommittee of Philadelphia defrayed the travelling expenses of many\r\nrefugees in sending some to New York City, some to Elmira and a few\r\nto Canada.[202] Frederick Douglass, who kept a station at Rochester,\r\nNew York, received contributions of money to pay the railroad fares\r\nof the fugitives he forwarded to Canada and to give them a little\r\nmore for pressing necessities.[203]\r\n\r\n  [201] _Reminiscences_, pp. 317, 321.\r\n\r\n  [202] Still's _Underground Railroad Records_, p. 613.\r\n\r\n  [203] _Ibid._, p. 598. In the fragment of a letter from which\r\n  Mr. Still quotes, Mr. Douglass says, \"They [the fugitives]\r\n  usually tarry with us only during the night, and are forwarded to\r\n  Canada by the morning train. We give them supper, lodging, and\r\n  breakfast, pay their expenses, and give them a half-dollar over.\"\r\n\r\nThe use of steam railroads as a means of transportation of\r\nthis class of passengers began with the completion of lines of\r\nroad to the lakes. This did not take place till about 1850. It\r\nwas, therefore, during the last decade of the history of the\r\nUnderground Road that surface lines, as they were sometimes called\r\nby abolitionists, became a part of the secret system. There were\r\nprobably more surface lines in Ohio than in any other state. The old\r\nMad River Railroad, or Sandusky, Dayton and Cincinnati Railroad, of\r\nwestern Ohio, (now a part of the \"Big Four\" system), began to be\r\nused at least as early as 1852 by instructed fugitives.[204] The\r\nSandusky, Mansfield and Newark Railroad (now the Baltimore and Ohio)\r\nfrom Utica, Licking County, Ohio, to Sandusky, was sometimes used\r\nby the same class of persons.[205] After the construction of the\r\nCleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad[206] as far as Greenwich\r\nin northern Ohio, fugitives often came to that point concealed in\r\nfreight-cars. In eastern Ohio there were two additional routes by\r\nrail sometimes employed in underground traffic: one of these appears\r\nto have been the Cleveland and Canton from Zanesville north,[207]\r\nand the other was the Cleveland and Western between Alliance and\r\nCleveland.[208] In Indiana the Louisville, New Albany and Chicago\r\nRailroad from Crawfordsville northward was patronized by underground\r\ntravellers until the activity of slave-hunters caused it to be\r\nabandoned.[209] Fugitives were sometimes transported across the\r\nState of Michigan by the Michigan Central Railroad. In Illinois\r\nthere seems to have been not less than three railroads that carried\r\nfugitives: these were the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy,[210] the\r\nChicago and Rock Island[211] and the Illinois Central.[212] When\r\nJohn Brown made his famous journey through Iowa in the winter of\r\n1858-1859 he shipped his company of twelve fugitives in a stock\r\ncar from West Liberty, Iowa, to Chicago, by way of the Chicago and\r\nRock Island route.[213] In Pennsylvania and New York there were\r\nseveral lines over which runaways were sent when circumstances\r\npermitted. At Harrisburg, Reading and other points along the\r\nPhiladelphia and Reading Railroad, fugitives were put aboard the\r\ncars for Philadelphia.[214] From Pennsylvania they were forwarded\r\nby the Vigilance Committee over different lines, sometimes by way\r\nof the Pennsylvania Railroad to New York City; sometimes by way of\r\nthe Philadelphia and Reading and the Northern Central to Elmira,\r\nNew York, whence they were sent on by the same line to Niagara\r\nFalls. Fugitives put aboard the cars at Elmira were furnished with\r\nmoney from a fund provided by the anti-slavery society. As a matter\r\nof precaution they were sent out of town at four o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and were always placed by the train officials, who knew\r\ntheir destination, in the baggage-car.[215] The New York Central\r\nRailroad from Rochester west was an outlet made use of by Frederick\r\nDouglass in passing slaves to Canada. At Syracuse, during several\r\nyears before the beginning of the War, one of the directors of\r\nthis road, Mr. Horace White, the father of Dr. Andrew D. White,\r\ndistributed passes to fugitives. This fact did not come to the\r\nknowledge of Dr. White until after his father's demise. He relates:\r\n\"Some years after ... I met an old 'abolitionist' of Syracuse, who\r\nsaid to me that he had often come to my father's house, rattled at\r\nthe windows, informed my father of the passes he needed for fugitive\r\nslaves, received them through the window, and then departed, nobody\r\nelse being the wiser. On my asking my mother, who survived my father\r\nseveral years, about it, she said: 'Yes, such things frequently\r\noccurred, and your father, if he was satisfied of the genuineness of\r\nthe request, always wrote off the passes and handed them out, asking\r\nno questions.\"[216]\r\n\r\n  [204] The _Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, p. 21.\r\n\r\n  [205] _Ibid._, pp. 23, 57, 79.\r\n\r\n  [206] _Ibid._, p. 74.

Vessels engaged in\r\nour coastwise trade became more or less involved in transporting\r\nfugitives from Southern ports to Northern soil. Small trading\r\nvessels, returning from their voyages to Norfolk and Portsmouth,\r\nVirginia, landed slaves on the New England coast.[220] In July,\r\n1853, the brig _Florence_ (Captain Amos Hopkins, of Hallowell,\r\nMaine) from Wilmington, North Carolina, was required, while lying\r\nin Boston harbor, to surrender a fugitive found on board. In\r\nSeptember, 1854, the schooner _Sally Ann_ (of Belfast, Maine), from\r\nthe same Southern port, was induced to give up a slave known to be\r\non board. In October of the same year the brig _Cameo_ (of Augusta,\r\nMaine) brought a stowaway from Jacksonville, Florida, into Boston\r\nharbor, and, as in the two preceding cases, the slave was rescued\r\nfrom the danger of return to the South through the activity and\r\nshrewdness of Captain Austin Bearse, the agent of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee of Boston.[221] The son of a slaveholder living at\r\nNewberne, North Carolina, forwarded slaves from that point to the\r\nVigilance Committee of Philadelphia on vessels engaged in the lumber\r\ntrade.[222] In November, 1855, Captain Fountain brought twenty-one\r\nfugitives concealed on his vessel in a cargo of grain from Norfolk,\r\nVirginia, to Philadelphia.[223]\r\n\r\n  [220] Mrs. Elizabeth Buffum Chace, _Anti-Slavery Reminiscences_,\r\n  pp. 27, 30.\r\n\r\n  [221] Austin Bearse, _Reminiscences of Fugitive-Slave Law Days in\r\n  Boston_, 1880, pp. 34-39.\r\n\r\n  [222] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, letter of Robert Purvis,\r\n  of Philadelphia, p. 335.\r\n\r\n  [223] Still, _Underground Railroad Records_, pp. 165-172. For\r\n  other cases, see pp. 211, 379-381, 437, 558, 559-565.\r\n\r\nThe tributaries flowing into the Ohio River from Virginia and\r\nKentucky furnished convenient channels of escape for many slaves.\r\nThe concurrent testimony of abolitionists living along the Ohio\r\nis to the effect that streams like the Kanawha River bore many a\r\nboat-load of fugitives to the southern boundary of the free states.\r\nIt is not a mere coincidence that a large number of the most\r\nimportant centres of activity lie along the southern line of the\r\nWestern free states at points near or opposite the mouths of rivers\r\nand creeks. On the Mississippi, Ohio and Illinois rivers north-bound\r\nsteamboats not infrequently provided the means of escape. Jefferson\r\nDavis declared in the Senate that many slaves escaped from his state\r\ninto Ohio by taking passage on the boats of the Mississippi.[224]\r\n\r\n  [224] See p. 312, Chapter X.\r\n\r\nAbolitionists found it desirable to have waterway extensions of\r\ntheir secret lines. Boats, the captains of which were favorable,\r\nwere therefore drafted into the service when running on convenient\r\nroutes. Boats plying between Portland, Maine, and St. John, New\r\nBrunswick, or other Canadian ports, often took these passengers free\r\nof charge.[225] Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington, Delaware, sometimes\r\nsent negroes by steamboat to Philadelphia to be cared for by the\r\nVigilance Committee.[226] It happened on several occasions that\r\nfugitives at Portland and Boston were put aboard ocean steamers\r\nbound for England.[227] William and Ellen Craft were sent to England\r\nafter having narrowly escaped capture in Boston.[228]\r\n\r\n  [225] Letters of Brown Thurston, Portland, Me., Jan. 13, 1893,\r\n  and Oct. 21, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [226] For letters from Mr. Garrett to William Still, of the\r\n  Acting Committee of Vigilance of Philadelphia, notifying him\r\n  that fugitives had been sent by boat, see Still's _Underground\r\n  Railroad Records_, pp. 380, 387.\r\n\r\n  [227] Letter of S. T. Pickard, Portland, Me., Nov. 18, 1893.\r\n\r\n  [228] Still, _Underground Railroad Records_, p. 368; Wilson,\r\n  _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol. II, p. 325; _New England\r\n  Magazine_, January, 1890, p. 580.\r\n\r\nOn the great lakes the boat service was extensive. The boats of\r\nGeneral Reed touching at Racine, Wisconsin, received fugitives\r\nwithout fare. Among these were the _Sultana_ (Captain Appleby), the\r\n_Madison_, the _Missouri_, the _Niagara_ and the _Keystone State_.\r\nCaptain Steele of the propeller _Galena_ was a friend of fugitives,\r\nas was also Captain Kelsey of the _Chesapeake_. Mr. A. P. Dutton\r\nwas familiar with these vessels and their officers, and for twenty\r\nyears or more shipped runaway slaves as well as cargoes of grain\r\nfrom his dock in Racine.[229] The _Illinois_ (Captain Blake),\r\nrunning between Chicago and Detroit, was a safe boat on which to\r\nplace passengers whose destination was Canada.[230] John G. Weiblen\r\nnavigated the lakes in 1855 and 1856, and took many refugees from\r\nChicago to Collingwood, Ontario.[231] The _Arrow_,[232] the _United\r\nStates_,[233] the _Bay City_ and the _Mayflower_ plying between\r\nSandusky and Detroit, were boats the officers of which were always\r\nwilling to help negroes reach Canadian ports. The _Forest Queen_,\r\nthe _Morning Star_ and the _May Queen_, running between Cleveland\r\nand Detroit, the _Phœbus_, a little boat plying between Toledo and\r\nDetroit, and, finally, some scows and sail-boats, are among the old\r\ncraft of the great lakes that carried many slaves to their land of\r\npromise.[234] A clue to the number of refugees thus transported\r\nto Canada is perhaps given by the record of the boat upon which\r\nthe fugitive, William Wells Brown, found employment. This boat ran\r\nfrom Cleveland to Buffalo and to Detroit. It quickly became known\r\nat Cleveland that Mr. Brown would take escaped slaves under his\r\nprotection without charge, hence he rarely failed to find a little\r\ncompany ready to sail when he started out from Cleveland. \"In the\r\nyear 1842,\" he says, \"I conveyed, from the first of May to the first\r\nof December, sixty-nine fugitives over Lake Erie to Canada.\"[235]\r\n\r\n  [229] Letter of A. P.

Brown_, by himself, 1848, pp. 107,\r\n  108.\r\n\r\nThe account of the method of the Underground Railroad could scarcely\r\nbe called complete without some notice of the rescue of fugitives\r\nunder arrest. The first rescue occurred at the intended trial of\r\nthe first fugitive slave case in Boston in 1793. Mr. Josiah Quincy,\r\ncounsel for the fugitive, \"heard a noise, and, turning around,\r\nsaw the constables lying sprawling on the floor, and a passage\r\nopening through the crowd, through which the fugitive was taking his\r\ndeparture without stopping to hear the opinion of the court.\"[236]\r\n\r\n  [236] Mr. Quincy's report of the case, quoted by M. G. McDougall,\r\n  _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 35.\r\n\r\nThe prototype of deliverances thus established was, it is true,\r\nmore or less deviated from in later instances, but the general\r\ncharacteristics of these cases are such that they naturally fall\r\ninto one class. They are cases in which the execution of the law\r\nwas interfered with by friends of the prisoner, who was spirited\r\naway as quickly as possible. The deliverance in 1812 of a supposed\r\nrunaway from the hands of his captor by the New England settlers\r\nof Worthington, Ohio, has already been referred to in general\r\nterms.[237] But some details of the incident are necessary to bring\r\nout more clearly the propriety of its being included in the category\r\nof instances of violation of the constitutional provision for the\r\nrendition of escaped slaves. It appears that word was brought\r\nto the village of Worthington of the capture of the fugitive at\r\na neighboring town, and that the villagers under the direction\r\nof Colonel James Kilbourne took immediate steps to release the\r\nnegro, who, it was said, was tied with ropes, and being afoot, was\r\ncompelled to keep up as best he could with his master's horse. On\r\nthe arrival of the slave-owner and his chattel, the latter was\r\nfreed from his bonds by the use of a butcher-knife in the hands\r\nof an active villager, and the forms of a legal dismissal were\r\ngone through before a court and an audience whose convictions were\r\nruinous to any representations the claimant was able to make. The\r\ndispossessed master was permitted to continue his journey southward,\r\nwhile the negro was directed to get aboard a government wagon on\r\nits way northward to Sandusky. The return of the slave-hunter a day\r\nor two later with a process obtained in Franklinton, authorizing\r\nthe retaking of his property, secured him a second hearing,\r\nbut did not change the result. A fugitive, Basil Dorsey, from\r\nLiberty, Frederick County, Maryland, was seized in Bucks County,\r\nPennsylvania, in 1836, and carried away. Overtaken by Mr. Robert\r\nPurvis at Doylestown, he was brought into court, and the hearing of\r\nthe case was postponed for two weeks. When the day of trial came the\r\ncounsel for the slave succeeded in getting the case dismissed on the\r\nground of certain objections. Thereupon the claimants of the slave\r\nhastened to a magistrate for a new warrant, but just as they were\r\nreturning to rearrest the fugitive, he was hustled into the buggy of\r\nMr. Purvis and driven rapidly out of the reach of the pursuers.[238]\r\nIn October, 1853, the case of Louis, a fugitive from Kentucky on\r\ntrial in Cincinnati, was brought to a conclusion in an unexpected\r\nway. The United States commissioner was about to pronounce judgment\r\nwhen the prisoner, taking advantage of a favorable opportunity,\r\nslipped from his chair, had a good hat placed upon his head by\r\nsome friend, passed out of the court-room among a crowd of colored\r\nvisitors and made his way cautiously to Avondale. A few minutes\r\nafter the disappearance of the fugitive his absence was discovered\r\nby the marshal that had him in charge; and although careful search\r\nwas made for him, he escaped to Canada by means of the Underground\r\nRailroad.[239] In April, 1859, Charles Nalle, a slave from Culpeper\r\nCounty, Virginia, was discovered in Troy, New York, and taken before\r\nthe United States commissioner, who remanded him back to slavery.\r\nAs the news of this decision spread, a crowd gathered about the\r\ncommissioner's office. In the meantime, a writ of habeas corpus was\r\nserved upon the marshal that had arrested Nalle, commanding that\r\nofficer to bring the prisoner before a judge of the Supreme Court.\r\nWhen the marshal and his deputies appeared with the slave, the crowd\r\nmade a charge upon them, and a hand-to-hand melée resulted. Inch by\r\ninch the progress of the officers was resisted until they were worn\r\nout, and the slave escaped. In haste the fugitive was ferried across\r\nthe river to West Troy, only to fall into the hands of a constable\r\nand be again taken into custody. The mob had followed, however, and\r\nnow stormed the door behind which the prisoner rested under guard.\r\nIn the attack the door was forced open, and over the body of a\r\nnegro assailant, struck down in the fray, the slave was torn from\r\nhis guards, and sent on his way to Canada.[240] Well-known cases\r\nof rescue, such as the Shadrach case, which occurred in Boston in\r\nJanuary, 1851, and the Jerry rescue, which occurred in Syracuse nine\r\nmonths later, may be omitted here. They, like many others that have\r\nbeen less often chronicled, show clearly the temper of resolute men\r\nin the communities where they occurred. It was felt by these persons\r\nthat the slave, who had already paid too high a penalty for his\r\ncolor, could not expect justice at the hands of the law, that his\r\nliberty must be preserved to him, and a base statute be thwarted at\r\nany cost.\r\n\r\n  [237] See p. 38.\r\n\r\n  [238] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, pp. 356-361.\r\n\r\n  [239] Levi Coffin, _Reminiscences_, pp. 548-554.\r\n\r\n  [240] This account is condensed from a report given in the _Troy\r\n  Whig_, April 28, 1859, and printed in the book entitled, _Harriet\r\n  the Moses of Her People_, pp. 143-149.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REPUTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nMr. Coffin and his wife aided more than 3000 slaves in their\r\nflight.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nUNDERGROUND AGENTS, STATION-KEEPERS, OR CONDUCTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nPersons opposed to slavery were, naturally, the friends of the\r\nfugitive slave, and were ever ready to respond to his appeals\r\nfor help. Shelter and food were readily supplied him, and he was\r\ndirected or conveyed, generally in the night, to sympathizing\r\nneighbors, until finally, without any forethought or management on\r\nhis own part, he found himself in Canada a free man. These helpers,\r\nin the course of time, came to be called agents, station-keepers, or\r\nconductors on the Underground Railroad. Of the names of those that\r\nbelonged to this class of practical emancipationists, 3,211 have\r\nbeen catalogued;[241] change of residence and death have made it\r\nimpossible to obtain the names of many more. Considering the kind\r\nof labor performed and the danger involved, one is impressed with\r\nthe unselfish devotion to principle of these emancipators. There was\r\nfor them, of course, no outward honor, no material recompense, but\r\ninstead such contumely and seeming disgrace as can now be scarcely\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\n  [241] See Appendix E, pp. 403-439.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they were rich in courage, and their hospitality\r\nwas equal to all emergencies. They gladly gave aid and comfort\r\nto every negro seeking freedom; and the numbers befriended by\r\nmany helpers despite penalties and abuse show with what moral\r\ndetermination the work was carried on. It has been said that the\r\nHopkins, Salsbury, Snediger, Dickey and Kirkpatrick families,\r\nof southern Ohio, forwarded more than 1,000 fugitives to Canada\r\nbefore the year 1817.[242] Daniel Gibbons, of Lancaster County,\r\nPennsylvania, was engaged in helping fugitive slaves during a period\r\nof fifty-six years. \"He did not keep a record of the number he\r\npassed until 1824. But prior to that time, it was supposed to have\r\nbeen over 200, and up to the time of his death (in 1853) he had\r\naided about 1,000.\"[243] It has been estimated that Dr. Nathan M.\r\nThomas, of Schoolcraft, Michigan, forwarded between 1,000 and 1,500\r\nfugitives.[244] John Fairfield, the abductor, \"piloted not only\r\nhundreds, but thousands.\"[245] The Rev. Charles T. Torrey went to\r\nMaryland and \"from there sent--as he wrote previous to 1844--some\r\n400 slaves over different routes to Canada.\"[246] Philo Carpenter,\r\nof Chicago, is reported to have escorted 200 fugitives to vessels\r\nbound for Canada.[247] In a letter to William Still, in November,\r\n1857, Elijah F. Pennypacker, of Chester County, Pennsylvania,\r\nwrites, \"we have within the past two months passed forty-three\r\nthrough our hands.\"[248] H. B. Leeper, of Princeton, Illinois,\r\nsays that the most successful business he ever accomplished in\r\nthis line was the helping on of thirty-one men and women in six\r\nweeks' time.[249] Leverett B. Hill, of Wakeman, Ohio, assisted 103\r\non their way to Canada during the year 1852.[250] Mr. Van Dorn, of\r\nQuincy, in a service of twenty-five years, assisted \"some two or\r\nthree hundred fugitives.\"[251] W. D. Schooley, of Richmond, Indiana,\r\nwrites, \"I think I must have assisted over 100 on their way to\r\nliberty.\"[252] Jonathan H. Gray, Milton Hill and John H. Frazee were\r\nconductors at Carthage, Indiana, and are said to have helped over\r\n150 fugitives.[253] \"Thousands of fugitives found rest\" at Ripley,\r\nBrown County, Ohio.[254] During the lifetime of General McIntire,\r\na Virginian, who settled in Adams County, Ohio, \"more than 100\r\nslaves found a safe retreat under his roof.\" Other helpers in the\r\nsame state rendered service deserving of mention. Ozem Gardner, of\r\nSharon Township, Franklin County, \"assisted more than 200 fugitives\r\non their way in all weathers and at all times of the day and\r\nnight.\"[255] It is estimated by a friend of Dr. J. A. Bingham and\r\nGeorge J. Payne, two operators of Gallia County, that the line of\r\nescape with which these men were connected was travelled by about\r\n200 slaves every year from 1845 to 1856.[256] From 1844 to 1860\r\nJohn H. Stewart, a colored station-keeper of the same county, kept\r\nabout 100 fugitives at his house.[257] Five hundred are said to have\r\npassed through the hands of Thomas L. Gray, of Deavertown, in Morgan\r\nCounty.[258] Ex-President Fairchild speaks of the \"multitudes\"\r\nof fugitives that came to Oberlin, and says that \"not one was\r\never finally taken back to bondage.\"[259] Many other stations and\r\nstation-agents that were instrumental in helping large numbers of\r\nslaves from bondage to freedom cannot be mentioned here.\r\n\r\n  [242] William Birney, _James G.

On the contrary, they were zealous in their endeavors to\r\nmake converts to a doctrine that seemed to them to have the combined\r\nwarrant of Scripture and of their own conscience, and that agreed\r\nwith the convictions of the fathers of the Republic. The Golden\r\nRule and the preamble of the Declaration of Independence they often\r\nrecited in support of their position. When they had transgressed\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law of Congress they were wont to find their\r\njustification in what ex-President Fairchild of Oberlin has aptly\r\ncalled the Fugitive Slave Law of the Mosaic institutions:[260] \"Thou\r\nshalt not deliver unto his master the servant which hath escaped\r\nunto thee; he shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place\r\nwhich he shall choose in one of thy gates where it liketh him best;\r\nthou shalt not oppress him.\"[261] They refused to observe a law\r\nthat made it a felony in their opinion to give a cup of cold water\r\nto famishing men and women fleeing from servitude. Their faith and\r\ndetermination is clearly expressed in one of the old anti-slavery\r\nsongs:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis the law of God in the human soul,\r\n      'Tis the law in the Word Divine;\r\n    It shall live while the earth in its course shall roll,\r\n      It shall live in this soul of mine.\r\n    Let the law of the land forge its bonds of wrong,\r\n      I shall help when the self-freed crave;\r\n    For the law in my soul, bright, beaming, and strong,\r\n      Bids me succor the fleeing slave.\"\r\n\r\nTheodore Parker was but the mouthpiece of many abolitionists\r\nthroughout the Northern states when he said, at the conclusion of a\r\nsermon in 1850: \"It is known to you that the Fugitive Slave Bill has\r\nbecome a law.... To law framed of such iniquity I owe no allegiance.\r\nHumanity, Christianity, manhood revolts against it.... For myself\r\nI say it solemnly, I will shelter, I will help, and I will defend\r\nthe fugitive with all my humble means and power. I will act with\r\nany body of decent and serious men, as the head, or the foot, or\r\nthe hand, in any mode not involving the use of deadly weapons, to\r\nnullify and defeat the operation of this law....\"[262]\r\n\r\n  [260] Fairchild, _The Underground Railroad_, Vol. IV; _Tract No.\r\n  87_, Western Reserve Historical Society, p. 97.\r\n\r\n  [261] Deut. xxiii, 15, 16.\r\n\r\n  [262] Delivered in Melodeon Hall, Boston, Oct. 6, 1850.\r\n  The _Chronotype_, Oct. 7, 1850. See Vol. II, No. 2, of the\r\n  _Scrap-book_ relating to Theodore Parker, compiled by Miss C. C.\r\n  Thayer, Boston Public Library.\r\n\r\nSentiments of this kind were cherished in almost every Northern\r\ncommunity by a few persons at least. There were some New England\r\ncolonies in the West where anti-slavery sentiments predominated.\r\nThese, like some of the religious communities, as those of the\r\nQuakers and Covenanters, became well-known centres of underground\r\nactivity. In general it is safe to say that the majority of helpers\r\nin the North were of Anglo-American stock, descendants of the\r\nPuritan and Quaker settlers of the Eastern states, or of Southerners\r\nthat had moved to the Northern states to be rid of slavery. The\r\nmany stations in the eastern and northern parts of Ohio and the\r\nnorthern part of Illinois may be safely attributed to the large\r\nproportion of New England settlers in those districts. Localities\r\nwhere the work of befriending slaves was largely in the hands of\r\nQuakers will be mentioned in another connection. Southern settlers\r\nin Brown County and adjoining districts in Ohio are said to have\r\nbeen regularly forwarding escaped slaves to Canada before 1817.[263]\r\nThe emigration of a number of these settlers to Bond County,\r\nIllinois, about 1820, and the removal of a few families from that\r\nregion to Putnam County in the same state about a decade later,\r\nhelps to explain the early development of secret routes in the\r\nsouthern and north central parts of Illinois.[264]\r\n\r\n  [263] William Birney, _James G. Birney and His Times_, p. 435.\r\n\r\n  [264] Letter of H. B. Leeper, Princeton, Ill., Dec. 19, 1895.\r\n\r\nIn the South much secret aid was rendered fugitives, no doubt,\r\nby persons of their own race. Two colored market-women in\r\nBaltimore were efficient agents for the Vigilance Committee of\r\nPhiladelphia.[265] Frederick Douglass's connection with the\r\nUnderground Railroad began long before he left the South.[266] In\r\nthe North, people of the African race were to be found in most\r\ncommunities, and in many places they became energetic workers. Negro\r\nsettlements in the interior of the free states, as well as along\r\ntheir southern frontier, soon came to form important links in the\r\nchain of stations leading from the Southern states to Canada.\r\n\r\n  [265] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, p. 355.\r\n\r\n  [266] Letter of Frederick Douglass, Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D.C.,\r\n  March 27, 1893. Mr. Douglass escaped from slavery in 1839.\r\n\r\nIn the early days running slaves sometimes sought and received\r\naid from Indians. This fact is evidenced by the introduction of\r\nfugitive recovery clauses into a number of the treaties made between\r\nthe colonies and Indian tribes. Seven out of the eight treaties\r\nmade between 1784 and 1786 contained clauses for the return of\r\nblack prisoners, or of \"negroes and other property.\"[267] A few of\r\nthe colonies offered rewards to induce Indians to apprehend and\r\nrestore runaways. In 1669 Maryland \"ordered that any Indian who\r\nshall apprehend a fugitive may have a 'match coate' or its value.\r\nVirginia would give '20 armes length of Roanake,' or its value,\r\nwhile in Connecticut 'two yards of cloth' was considered sufficient\r\ninducement.\"[268] The inhabitants of the Ottawa village of Chief\r\nKinjeino in northwestern Ohio were kindly disposed towards the\r\nfugitive;[269] and the people of Chief Brant, who held an estate on\r\nthe Grand River in Ontario west of Niagara Falls, were in the habit\r\nof receiving colored refugees.[270]\r\n\r\n  [267] M.

Howard, Wauseon, O., Aug. 22,\r\n  1894.\r\n\r\n  [270] See Chapter VII, p. 203.\r\n\r\nThe people of Scotch and Scotch-Irish descent were naturally liberty\r\nloving, and seem to have given hearty support to the anti-slavery\r\ncause in whatever form it presented itself to them. The small\r\nnumber of Scotch communities in Morgan and Logan counties, Ohio,\r\nand in Randolph and Washington counties, Illinois, were centres of\r\nunderground service.\r\n\r\nThe secret work of the English, Irish and German settlers cannot be\r\nso readily localized. In various places a single German, Irishman,\r\nor Englishman is known to have aided escaped slaves in coöperation\r\nwith a few other persons of different nationality, but so far as\r\nknown there were no groups made up of representatives of one or\r\nanother of these races engaged in such enterprises. At Toledo,\r\nOhio, the company of helpers comprised Congressman James M. Ashley,\r\na Pennsylvanian by birth; Richard Mott, a Quaker; James Conlisk,\r\nan Irishman; William H. Merritt, a negro; and several others.[271]\r\nLyman Goodnow, an operator of Waukesha, Wisconsin, says he was told\r\nthat \"in cases of emergency the Germans were next best to Quakers\r\nfor protection.\"[272] Two German companies from Massachusetts\r\nenlisted for the War only when promised that they should not be\r\nrequired to restore runaways to their owners.[273]\r\n\r\n  [271] Conversation with the Hon. James M. Ashley, Toledo, O.,\r\n  August, 1894.\r\n\r\n  [272] Narrative of Lyman Goodnow in _History of Waukesha County,\r\n  Wisconsin_, p. 462.\r\n\r\n  [273] See p. 355, Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nSome religious communities and church societies were conservators\r\nof abolition ideas. The Quakers deserve, in this work, to be placed\r\nbefore all other denominations because of their general acceptance\r\nand advocacy of anti-slavery doctrines when the system of slavery\r\nhad no other opponents. From the time of George Fox until the last\r\ntraces of the evil were swept from the English-speaking world many\r\nQuakers bore a steadfast testimony against it.[274] Fox reminded\r\nslaveholders that if they were in their slaves' places they would\r\nconsider it \"very great bondage and cruelty,\" and he urged upon the\r\nFriends in America to preach the gospel to the enslaved blacks. In\r\n1688 German Friends at Germantown, Pennsylvania, made an official\r\nprotest \"against the traffic in the bodies of men and the treatment\r\nof men as cattle.\" By 1772 New England Friends began to disown\r\n(expel) members for failing to manumit their slaves; and four years\r\nlater both the Philadelphia and the New York yearly meetings made\r\nslaveholding a disownable offence. A similar step was taken by the\r\nBaltimore Yearly Meeting in 1777; and meetings in Virginia were\r\ndirected, in 1784, to disown those that refused to emancipate their\r\nslaves.[275] Owing to obstacles in the way of setting slaves free in\r\nNorth Carolina, a committee of Quakers of that state was appointed\r\nin 1822 to examine the laws of some of the free states respecting\r\nthe admission of people of color therein. In 1823 the committee\r\nreported that there was \"nothing in the laws of Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nIllinois to prevent the introduction of people of color into those\r\nstates, and agents were instructed to remove slaves placed in their\r\ncare as fast as they were willing to go.\" These facts show the\r\nsentiment that prevailed in the Society of Friends. Many Southern\r\nQuakers moved to the North on account of their hatred of slavery,\r\nand established such important centres of underground work as\r\nSpringboro and Salem, Ohio, and Spiceland and New Garden, Indiana.\r\nQuakers in New Bedford and Lynn, Massachusetts, and Valley Falls,\r\nRhode Island, engaged in the service. The same class of people in\r\nMaryland coöperated with members of their society in the vicinity of\r\nPhiladelphia. The existence of numerous Underground Railroad centres\r\nin southeastern Pennsylvania and in eastern Indiana is explained by\r\nthe fact that a large number of Quakers dwelt in those regions.\r\n\r\n  [274] S. B. Weeks, _Southern Quakers and Slavery_, p. 198.\r\n\r\n  [275] _American Church History_, Vol. XII; see article on \"The\r\n  Society of Friends,\" by Professor A. C. Thomas, pp. 242-248; also\r\n  Weeks, _Southern Quakers and Slavery_, pp. 198-219.\r\n\r\nThe Methodists began to take action against slavery in 1780. At an\r\ninformal conference held at Baltimore in that year the subject was\r\npresented in the form of a \"Question,--Ought not this conference\r\nto require those travelling preachers who hold slaves to give\r\npromises to set them free?\" The answer given was in the affirmative.\r\nConcerning the membership the language adopted was as follows: \"We\r\npass our disapprobation on all our friends who keep slaves; and\r\nadvise their freedom.\" Under the influence of Wesleyan preachers, it\r\nis said, not a few cases of emancipation occurred. At a conference\r\nin 1785, however, it was decided to \"suspend the execution of the\r\nminute on slavery till the deliberations of a future conference....\"\r\nFour years later a clause appeared in the Discipline, by whose\r\nauthority is not known, prohibiting \"The buying or selling the\r\nbodies or souls of men, women, or children, with an intention to\r\nenslave them.\" This provision evidently referred to the African\r\nslave-trade. In 1816 the General Conference adopted a resolution\r\nthat \"no slaveholder shall be eligible to any official station in\r\nour Church hereafter, where the laws of the state in which he lives\r\nwill admit of emancipation, and permit the liberated slave to enjoy\r\nfreedom.\" Later there seems to have been a disposition on the part\r\nof the church authorities to suppress the agitation of the slavery\r\nquestion, but it can scarcely be doubted that the well-known views\r\nof the Wesleys and of Whitfield remained for some at least the\r\nstandard of right opinion, and that their declarations formed for\r\nthese the rule of action. In 1842 a secession from the church took\r\nplace, chiefly if not altogether on account of the question of\r\nslavery, and a number of abolitionist members of the uncompromising\r\ntype founded a new church organization, which they called the\r\n\"Wesleyan Methodist Connection of America.\" Slave-holders were\r\nexcluded from fellowship in this body. Within two or three years the\r\nnew organization had drawn away twenty thousand members from the\r\nold.[276] In 1844 a much larger secession took place on the same\r\nquestion, the occasion being the institution of proceedings before\r\nthe General Conference against the Rev. James O. Andrew, D.D., a\r\nslave-holding bishop of the South. This so aggravated the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal societies in the slave states that they withdrew and\r\nformed the Methodist Episcopal Church South. Among the members of\r\nthe Wesleyan Methodist Connection and of the older society of the\r\nNorth there were a number of zealous underground operators. Indeed,\r\nit came to be said of the Wesleyans, as of the Quakers, that almost\r\nevery neighborhood where a few of them lived was likely to be a\r\nstation of the secret Road to Canada. It is probable that some of\r\nthe Wesleyans at Wilmington, Ohio, coöperated with Quakers at that\r\npoint. In Urbana, Ohio, there were Methodists of the two divisions\r\nengaged.[277] Service was also performed by Wesleyans at Tippecanoe,\r\nDeersville and Rocky Fort in Tuscarawas County,[278] and at Piqua,\r\nMiami County, Ohio.[279] In Iowa a number of Methodist ministers\r\nwere engaged in the work.[280]\r\n\r\n  [276] H.

All the various\r\nwings of Presbyterianism seem to have had representatives in\r\nthis class of anti-slavery people. The sinfulness of slavery\r\nwas a proposition that found uncompromising advocates among the\r\nPresbyterian ministers of the South in the early part of this\r\ncentury. In 1804 the Rev. James Gilliland removed from South\r\nCarolina to Brown County, Ohio, because he had been enjoined by his\r\npresbytery and synod \"to be silent in the pulpit on the subject\r\nof the emancipation of the African.\"[281] Other ministers of\r\nprominence, like Thomas D. Baird, David Nelson and John Rankin,\r\nleft the South because they were not free to speak against slavery.\r\nIn 1818 the Presbyterian Church declared the system \"inconsistent\r\nwith the law of God and totally irreconcilable with the gospel of\r\nChrist.\" This teaching was afterwards departed from in 1845 when the\r\nAssembly confined its protest to admitting rather mildly that there\r\nwas \"evil connected with slavery,\" and declining to countenance\r\n\"the traffic in slaves for the sake of gain; the separation of\r\nhusbands and wives, parents and children, for the sake of filthy\r\nlucre or the convenience of the master; or cruel treatment of\r\nslaves in any respect.\" The dissatisfaction caused by this evident\r\ncompromise led to the formation of a new church in 1847 by the\r\n\"New School\" Presbytery of Ripley, Ohio, and a part of the \"Old\r\nSchool\" Presbytery of Mahoning, Pennsylvania. This organization\r\nwas called the Free Church, and by 1860 had extended as far west\r\nas Iowa.[282] It is not strange that the region in Ohio where the\r\nFree Presbyterian Church was founded was plentifully dotted with\r\nstations of the Underground Railroad, and that the house of the\r\nRev. John Rankin, who was the leader of the movement, was known\r\nfar and wide as a place of refuge for the fugitive slave.[283] At\r\nSavannah, Ashland County, Iberia, Morrow County, and a point near\r\nMillersburgh, Holmes County, Ohio, the work is associated with Free\r\nPresbyterian societies once existing in those neighborhoods.[284]\r\nIn the northern part of Adams County, as also in the northern part\r\nof Logan County, Ohio, fugitives were received into the homes of\r\nCovenanters. Galesburg, Illinois, with its college was founded in\r\n1837 by Presbyterians and Congregationalists, who united to form\r\none religious society under the name of the \"Presbyterian Church\r\nof Galesburg.\" Opposition to slavery was one of the conditions of\r\nmembership in this organization from the beginning. This intense\r\nanti-slavery feeling caused the church to withdraw from the\r\npresbytery in 1855.[285] From the starting of the colony until the\r\ntime of the War fugitives from Missouri were conducted thither\r\nwith the certainty of obtaining protection. Thus Galesburg became,\r\nprobably, the principal underground station in Illinois.[286]\r\nJoseph S. White, of New Castle, in western Pennsylvania, notes the\r\ncircumstance that all the men with whom he acted in underground\r\nenterprises were Presbyterians.[287]\r\n\r\n  [281] Wm. B.

The\r\nacquisition of a large anti-slavery contingent from Lane Seminary in\r\n1835 caused the college to be known from that time on as a \"hotbed\r\nof abolitionism.\" Fugitives were directed thither from points more\r\nor less remote, and during the period from 1835 to 1860 Oberlin\r\nwas a busy station,[288] receiving passengers from at least five\r\nconverging lines.[289] So notorious did the place become that a\r\nguide-board in the form of a fugitive running in the direction of\r\nthe town was set up by the authorities on the Middle Ridge road,\r\nsix miles north of Oberlin, and the sign of a tavern, four miles\r\naway, \"was ornamented on its Oberlin face with a representation\r\nof a fugitive slave pursued by a tiger.\"[290] On account of the\r\npersistent ignoring of the law against harboring slaves by those\r\nconnected with the institution, the existence of the college was\r\nput in jeopardy. Ex-President Fairchild relates that, \"A Democratic\r\nlegislature at different times agitated the question of repealing\r\nthe college charter. The fourth and last attempt was made in 1843,\r\nwhen the bill for repeal was indefinitely postponed in the House\r\nby a vote of thirty-six to twenty-nine.\"[291] The anti-slavery\r\ninfluence of Oberlin went abroad with its students. Ex-President\r\nW. M. Brooks, of Tabor College, Iowa, a graduate of Oberlin, says,\r\n\"The stations on the Underground Railroad in southwestern Iowa\r\nwere in the region of Civil Bend, where the colony from Oberlin,\r\nOhio, settled, which afterwards settled Tabor.... From this point\r\n(Civil Bend, now Percival) fugitives were brought to Tabor after\r\n1852; here the entire population was in sympathy with the escaped\r\nfugitives; ... there was scarcely a man in the community who was\r\nnot ready to do anything that was needed to help fugitives on their\r\nway to Canada.\"[292] The families that founded Tabor were \"almost\r\nall of them Congregationalists.\"[293] Professor L. F. Parker of\r\nGrinnell, Iowa, names Oberlin students in connection with Quakers as\r\nthe chief groups in Iowa whose houses were open to fugitives.[294]\r\nGrinnell itself was first settled by people that were mainly\r\nCongregationalists.[295] From the time of its foundation (1854) it\r\nwas an anti-slavery centre, \"well known and eagerly sought by the\r\nfew runaways who came from the meagre settlements southwest ... in\r\nMissouri.\"[296]\r\n\r\n  [288] James H.

Barber, of Meadville,\r\n  Pa., in Cambridge, Mass., June, 1897.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no open appeal made to church organizations\r\nfor help in behalf of fugitives except in Massachusetts. In 1851,\r\nand again in 1854, the Vigilance Committee of Boston deemed it\r\nwise to send out circulars to the clergymen of the commonwealth,\r\nrequesting that contributions be taken by them to be applied in\r\nmitigation of the misery caused by the enactment of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law. The boldness and originality of such an appeal, and\r\nmore especially the evident purpose of its framers to create\r\nsentiment by this means among the religious societies, entitle it\r\nto consideration. The first circular was sent out soon after the\r\nenactment of the odious law, and the second soon after the passage\r\nof the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The results secured by the two circulars\r\nwill be seen in the following letter from Francis Jackson, of\r\nBoston, to his fellow-townsmen and co-worker, the Rev. Theodore\r\nParker.\r\n\r\n  BOSTON, Aug. 27, 1854.\r\n\r\n  THEODORE PARKER:\r\n\r\n     _Dear Friend_,--The contributions of the churches in behalf of\r\n     the fugitive slaves I think have about all come in. I herewith\r\n     inclose you a schedule thereof, amounting in all to about $800,\r\n     being but _little more than half as much as they contributed in\r\n     1851_.\r\n\r\n     The Mass. Register published in January, 1854, states the number\r\n     of Religious Societies to be 1,547 (made up of 471 Orthodox, 270\r\n     Methodist, and all others 239). We sent circulars to the whole\r\n     1,547; only 78 of them have responded--say 1 in 20--from 130\r\n     Universalist societies, nothing, from 43 Episcopal $4, and 20\r\n     Friends $27--the Baptists--four times as many of these societies\r\n     have given now as gave in 1851, this may be because Brynes was a\r\n     Baptist minister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The average amount contributed by 77 societies (deducting\r\n     Frothingham of Salem) is $10 each; the 28th Congregationalist\r\n     Church in this city did not take up a contribution,\r\n     nevertheless, individual members thereof subscribed upwards\r\n     of $300; they being infidel have not been reckoned with the\r\n     churches.\r\n\r\n     Of the cities and large towns scarce any have contributed. Of\r\n     the 90 and 9 in Boston all have gone astray but 2--I have not\r\n     heard of our circular being read in one of them; still it may\r\n     have been. Those societies who have contributed, I judge were\r\n     least able to do so.\r\n\r\n  FRANCIS JACKSON.[298]\r\n\r\n  [298] Theodore Parker's _Scrap-book_, Boston Public Library.\r\n\r\nThe political affiliations of underground helpers before 1840 were,\r\nnecessarily, with one or the other of the old parties--the Whig\r\nor the Democratic. As the Whig party was predominantly Northern,\r\nand as its sentiments were more distinctly anti-slavery than those\r\nof its rival, it is fair to suppose that the small band of early\r\nabolitionists were, most of them, allied with that party.[299]\r\nThe Missouri Compromise in 1820, one may surmise, enabled those\r\nthat were wavering in their position to ally themselves with the\r\nparty that was less likely to make demands in the interests of the\r\nslave power. In 1840 opportunity was given abolitionists to take\r\nindependent political action by the nomination of a national Liberty\r\nticket. At that time, and again in 1844, many underground operators\r\nvoted for the candidates of the Liberty party, and subsequently for\r\nthe Free Soil nominees.[300]\r\n\r\n  [299] This view agrees with the testimony gathered by\r\n  correspondence from surviving abolitionists.\r\n\r\n  [300] This statement is based on a mass of correspondence.\r\n\r\nBut it is not to be supposed that all friends of the fugitive\r\njoined the political movement against slavery. Many there were\r\nthat regarded party action with disfavor, preferring the method of\r\nmoral suasion. These persons belonged to the Quakers, or to the\r\nGarrisonian abolitionists. The Friends or Quakers refused as far as\r\npossible to countenance slavery, and when the political development\r\nof the abolition cause came they regretted it, and their yearly\r\nmeetings withheld their official sanction, so far as known, from\r\nevery political organization. Nevertheless, there were some members\r\nof the Society of Friends that were swept into the current, and\r\nbecame active supporters of the Liberty party.[301] The most noted\r\nand influential of these was the anti-slavery poet, Whittier.[302]\r\nWhen, in 1860, the Republican party nominated Lincoln, \"a large\r\nmajority of the Friends, at least in the North and West, voted for\r\nhim.\"[303]\r\n\r\n  [301] Professor A. C. Thomas on \"The Society of Friends,\" in\r\n  _American Church History_, Vol. XII, 1894, pp. 284, 285.\r\n\r\n  [302] Oliver Johnson, _William Lloyd Garrison and His Times_,\r\n  1879, p. 322.\r\n\r\n  [303] Professor A. C. Thomas, in _American Church History_, Vol.\r\n  XII, p. 285.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Garrison that remained steadfast to the teachings\r\nand the example of their leader shunned all connection with\r\nthe political abolitionist movement. Garrison never voted but\r\nonce,[304] and by 1854 had gone so far in his denunciation of\r\nslavery that he burned the Constitution of the United States\r\nat an open-air celebration of the abolitionists at Framingham,\r\nMassachusetts.[305] To his dying day he seems to have believed \"that\r\nthe cause would have triumphed sooner, in a political sense, if the\r\nabolitionists had continued to act as one body, never yielding to\r\nthe temptation of forming a political party, but pressing forward in\r\nthe use of the same instrumentalities which were so potent from 1831\r\nto 1840.\"[306]\r\n\r\n  [304] _Life of Garrison_, by his children, Vol. I, p. 455.\r\n\r\n  [305] _Ibid._, Vol. III, p. 412.\r\n\r\n  [306] Oliver Johnson, _William Lloyd Garrison and His Times_, p.\r\n  310.\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists were ill-judged by their contemporaries, and were\r\nfrequently subjected to harsh language and occasionally to violent\r\ntreatment by persons of supposed respectability. The weight of\r\nopprobrium they were called upon to bear tested their great strength\r\nof character. If the probity, integrity and moral courage of this\r\nabused class had been made the criteria of their standing they would\r\nhave been held from the outset in high esteem by their neighbors.\r\nHowever, they lived to see the days of their disgrace turned into\r\ndays of triumph. \"The muse of history,\" says Rhodes, \"has done full\r\njustice to the abolitionists. Among them were literary men, who have\r\nknown how to present their cause with power, and the noble spirit\r\nof truthfulness pervades the abolition literature. One may search\r\nin vain for intentional misrepresentation. Abuse of opponents and\r\ncriticism of motives are common enough, but the historians of the\r\nabolition movement have endeavored to relate a plain, honest tale;\r\nand the country has accepted them and their work at their true\r\nvalue. Moreover, a cause and its promoters that have been celebrated\r\nin the vigorous lines of Lowell and sung in the impassioned verse of\r\nWhittier will always be of perennial memory.\"[307]\r\n\r\n  [307] _History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850_,\r\n  Vol. I, p. 75.\r\n\r\nContempt was not the only hardship that the abolitionist had to\r\nface when he admitted the fleeing black man within his door, but\r\nhe braved also the existing laws, and was sometimes compelled\r\nto suffer the consequences for disregarding the slaveholder's\r\nclaim of ownership. In 1842 the prosecution of John Van Zandt, of\r\nHamilton County, Ohio, was begun for attempting to aid nine slaves\r\nto escape. The case was tried first in the Circuit Court of the\r\nUnited States, and then taken by appeal to the Supreme Court. The\r\nsuits were not concluded when the defendant died in May, 1847. The\r\ndeath of the plaintiff soon after left the case to be settled by\r\nadministrators, who agreed that the costs, amounting to one thousand\r\ndollars, should be paid from the possessions of the defendant.[308]\r\nThe judgments against Van Zandt under the Fugitive Slave Law\r\namounted to seventeen hundred dollars.[309] In 1847 several members\r\nof a crowd that was instrumental in preventing the seizure of a\r\ncolored family by the name of Crosswhite, at Marshall, Michigan,\r\nwere indicted under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793. Two trials\r\nfollowed, and at the second trial three persons were convicted,\r\nthe verdict against them amounting, with expenses and costs, to\r\nsix thousand dollars.[310] In 1848 Daniel Kauffman, of Cumberland\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania, sheltered a family of thirteen slaves in his\r\nbarn, and gave them transportation northward. He was tried, and\r\nsentenced to pay two thousand dollars in fine and costs. Although\r\nthis decision was reversed by the United States Supreme Court, a new\r\nsuit was instituted in the Circuit Court of the United States and a\r\njudgment was rendered against Kauffman amounting with costs to more\r\nthan four thousand dollars. This sum was paid, in large part if not\r\naltogether, by contributions.[311] In 1854 Rush R. Sloane, a lawyer\r\nof Sandusky, Ohio, was tried for enabling seven fugitives to escape\r\nafter arrest by their pursuers. The two claimants of the slaves\r\ninstituted suit, but one only obtained a judgment, which amounted to\r\nthree thousand dollars and costs.[312] The arrest of the fugitive,\r\nAnthony Burns, in Boston, in the same year, was the occasion for\r\nindignation meetings at Faneuil and Meionaon Halls, which terminated\r\nin an attempt to rescue the unfortunate negro. Theodore Parker,\r\nWendell Phillips and T. W. Higginson took a conspicuous part in\r\nthese proceedings, and were indicted with others for riot. When the\r\nfirst case was taken up the counsel for the defence made a motion\r\nthat the indictment be quashed. This was sustained by the court, and\r\nthe affair ended by all the cases being dismissed.[313]\r\n\r\n  [308] Letter of N. L. Van Sandt, Clarinda, Iowa. (Mr. N. L.

See Chapter X, pp. 331-333.\r\n\r\nThese and other similar cases arising from the attempted enforcement\r\nof the Fugitive Slave Act in various parts of the country led to\r\nthe proposal of a Defensive League of Freedom. A pamphlet, issued\r\nsoon after the rendition of Burns, by Ellis Gray Loring, Samuel\r\nCabot, Jr., Henry J. Prentiss, John A. Andrew and Samuel G. Howe,\r\nof Boston, and James Freeman Clarke, of Roxbury, Massachusetts,\r\nstated the object of the proposed league to be \"to secure all\r\npersons claimed as fugitives from slavery, and to all persons\r\naccused of violating the Fugitive Slave Bill the fullest legal\r\nprotection; and also indemnify all such persons against costs,\r\nfines, and expenses, whenever they shall seem to deserve such\r\nindemnification.\" The league was to act as a \"society of mutual\r\nprotection and every member was to assume his portion of such\r\npenalties as would otherwise fall with crushing weight on a few\r\nindividuals.\" Subscriptions were to be made by the members of the\r\norganization, and five per cent of these subscriptions was to be\r\ncalled for any year when it was needed.[314] How much service this\r\nassociation actually performed, or whether, indeed, it got beyond\r\nthe stage of being merely proposed is not known; in any event, the\r\nfact is worth noting that men of marked ability, distinction and\r\nsocial connection were forming societies, like the Defensive League\r\nof Freedom, and the various vigilance committees, for the purpose of\r\ndefeating the Fugitive Slave Act.\r\n\r\n  [314] Pamphlet proposing a \"Defensive League of Freedom,\" pp. 1,\r\n  3, 11 and 12.\r\n\r\nAmong the underground helpers there are a number of notable persons\r\nthat have admitted with seeming satisfaction their complicity\r\nin disregarding the Fugitive Slave Law. A letter from Frederick\r\nDouglass, the famous Maryland bondman and anti-slavery orator, says:\r\n\"My connection with the Underground Railroad began long before I\r\nleft the South, and was continued as long as slavery continued,\r\nwhether I lived in New Bedford, Lynn [both in Massachusetts],\r\nor Rochester, N.Y. In the latter place I had as many as eleven\r\nfugitives under my roof at one time.\"[315] In his autobiography Mr.\r\nDouglass declares concerning his work in this connection: \"My agency\r\nwas all the more exciting and interesting because not altogether\r\nfree from danger. I could take not a step in it without exposing\r\nmyself to fine and imprisonment, ... but in face of this fact,\r\nI can say, I never did more congenial, attractive, fascinating,\r\nand satisfactory work.\"[316] Dr. Alexander M. Ross, a Canadian\r\nphysician and naturalist, who has received the decorations of\r\nknighthood from several of the monarchs of Europe in recognition of\r\nhis scientific discoveries, spent a considerable part of his time\r\nfrom 1856 to 1862 in spreading a knowledge of the routes leading to\r\nCanada among the slaves of the South.[317] Dr. Norton S. Townshend,\r\none of the organizers of the Ohio State University and for years\r\nprofessor of agriculture in that institution, acted as a conductor\r\non the Underground Railroad while he was a student of medicine\r\nin Cincinnati, Ohio.[318] Dr. Jared P.

Her own house on Walnut Hills,\r\nCincinnati, was a refuge whence persons whose types are portrayed\r\nin George and Eliza, the boy Jim and his mother, were guided by\r\nher husband and brother a portion of the way towards Canada.[320]\r\nColonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, the essayist and author,\r\nwhile stationed as the pastor of a free church in Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts, from 1852 to 1858, often had fugitives directed to\r\nhis care. In a recent letter he writes of having received on one\r\noccasion a \"consignment of a young white slave woman with two white\r\nchildren\" from the Rev. Samuel J. May, who had put her \"into the\r\nhands, for escort, of one of the most pro-slavery men in Worcester.\"\r\nThe pro-slavery man, of course, did not have a suspicion that he was\r\nacting as conductor on the Underground Railroad.[321]\r\n\r\n  [320] See Chapter X, pp.\r\n\r\n  [321] Letter of T.

Newton Peirce, to whom he contributed money\r\nfor the transportation of runaway slaves by rail from that point to\r\nCleveland.[323] What his views were of the irritating law of 1850,\r\nhe declared on the floor of the House of Representatives, February\r\n11, 1852, in the following words: \"... Let me say to Southern men;\r\nIt is your privilege to catch your own slaves, if any one catches\r\nthem.... When you ask us to pay the expenses of arresting your\r\nslaves, or to give the President authority to appoint officers\r\nto do that dirty work, give them power to compel our people to\r\ngive chase to the panting bondman, you overstep the bounds of the\r\nConstitution, and there we meet you, and there we stand and there\r\nwe shall remain.

Owen Lovejoy, brother of the martyr Elijah P.\r\nLovejoy, served four terms in the national House of Representatives.\r\nOn one occasion he was taunted by some pro-slavery members of the\r\nHouse with being a \"nigger-stealer.\" In a speech made February 21,\r\n1859, Mr. Lovejoy, referring to these accusations, said: \"Is it\r\ndesired to call attention to this fact--of my assisting fugitive\r\nslaves?... Owen Lovejoy lives at Princeton, Illinois, three-quarters\r\nof a mile east of the village, and he aids every fugitive that comes\r\nto his door and asks it.

During the next forty-four years he resided\r\nat Ripley, Ohio, in a neighborhood frequented by runaways.[338]\r\nDoubtless he became a patron of these midnight visitors at the\r\ntime of his location in Ripley. In 1828 he established himself in\r\na house situated upon the crest of a hill just back of the town\r\nand overlooking the Ohio River. For many years the lights beaming\r\nthrough the windows of this parsonage were hailed by slaves fleeing\r\nfrom the soil of Kentucky as beacons to guide them to a haven of\r\nsafety.[339]\r\n\r\n  [338] William Birney, _James G. Birney and His Times_, p. 435.\r\n\r\n  [339] J. C. Leggett, in a pamphlet entitled _Rev. John Rankin_,\r\n  1892, pp. 8, 9; see also _History of Brown County, Ohio_, p. 443.\r\n\r\nSamuel J. May, for many years a prominent minister in the Unitarian\r\nChurch, writes: \"So long ago as 1834, when I was living in the\r\neastern part of Connecticut, I had fugitives addressed to my\r\ncare.... Even after I came to reside in Syracuse [New York] I had\r\nmuch to do as a station-keeper or conductor on the Underground\r\nRailroad, until slavery was abolished by the proclamation of\r\nPresident Lincoln.... Fugitives came to me from Maryland, Virginia,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee and Louisiana. They came, too, at all hours\r\nof day and night, sometimes comfortably, yes, and even handsomely\r\nclad, but generally in clothes every way unfit to be worn, and in\r\nsome instances too unclean and loathsome to be admitted into my\r\nhouse.\"[340]\r\n\r\n  [340] Recollections of the _Anti-Slavery Conflict_, p. 297.\r\n\r\nTheodore Parker, the learned theologian and iconoclast of Boston,\r\noften deserted his study that he might work in the cause of\r\nhumanity. In his Journal, under the date October 23, 1850, Mr.\r\nParker wrote: \"... The first business of the anti-slavery men is to\r\nhelp the fugitives; we, like Christ, are to seek and save that which\r\nis lost.\"[341] In an unsigned note written in 1851 to his friend Dr.\r\nFrancis, Mr. Parker says:--\r\n\r\n     ... I have got some nice books (old ones) coming across the\r\n     water. But, alas me! such is the state of the poor fugitive\r\n     slaves, that I must attend to living men, and not to dead books,\r\n     and all this winter my time has been occupied with these poor\r\n     souls. The Vigilance Committee appointed me spiritual counsellor\r\n     of all fugitive slaves in Massachusetts while in peril.... The\r\n     Fugitive Slave Law has cost me some months of time already. I\r\n     have refused about sixty invitations to lecture and delayed the\r\n     printing of my book--for that! Truly the land of the pilgrims is\r\n     in great disgrace!\r\n\r\n  Yours truly.[342]\r\n\r\n  [341] John Weiss, _Life and Correspondence of Theodore Parker_,\r\n  1864, p. 95.\r\n\r\n  [342] John Weiss, _Life and Correspondence of Theodore Parker_,\r\n  1864, p. 96.\r\n\r\nAmong the underground workers there were two whose principal object\r\nin life seems to have been to assist fugitive slaves. These two\r\norganizers of underground travel were Levi Coffin, of Cincinnati,\r\nOhio, and Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington, Delaware, both lifelong\r\nmembers of the Society of Friends, both capable business men, both\r\nable to number the unfortunates they had succored in terms of\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nThomas Garrett was born in Pennsylvania in 1789, and espoused the\r\ncause of emancipation at the age of eighteen, when a colored woman\r\nin the employ of his father's family was kidnapped. He succeeded in\r\nrescuing the woman from the hands of her abductors, and from that\r\ntime on made it his special mission to aid negroes in their attempts\r\nto gain freedom. In 1822 he removed to Wilmington, Delaware, and\r\nduring the next forty years his efforts in behalf of fugitives were\r\nunremitting. He was not so fortunate as Levi Coffin in escaping the\r\npenalties of the Fugitive Slave Law; an open violation of the law\r\ngot him into difficulty in 1848. He was tried on four counts before\r\nJudge Taney, and his entire property was swallowed up in fines\r\namounting to eight thousand dollars. There is a tradition that the\r\npresiding judge admonished Garrett to take his loss as a lesson and\r\nin the future to desist from breaking the laws; whereupon the aged\r\nQuaker stoutly replied: \"Judge, thou hast not left me a dollar,\r\nbut I wish to say to thee, and to all in this court-room, that if\r\nany one knows of a fugitive who wants a shelter and a friend, send\r\nhim to Thomas Garrett and he will befriend him.\"[343] Although\r\nsixty years of age when misfortune befel him, Mr. Garrett was\r\nsuccessful in again acquiring a competence through the kindness of\r\nfellow-townsmen in advancing him capital with which to make a fresh\r\nstart. Though satisfied, he was wont to think that his real work\r\nin life was never finished. \"The war came a little too soon for my\r\nbusiness. I wanted to help off three thousand slaves. I had only got\r\nup to twenty-seven hundred!\"\r\n\r\n  [343] Lillie B. C.

McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 60.\r\n\r\nMr. Coffin was a native of North Carolina. Born in 1798, he was\r\nwhile still a boy moved to assist in the escape of slaves by\r\nwitnessing the cruel treatment the negroes were compelled to endure.\r\nIn 1826 he settled in Wayne County, Indiana, on the line of the\r\nUnderground Road, and such was his activity that his house at New\r\nGarden (now Fountain City) soon became the converging point of\r\nthree principal routes from Kentucky. In 1847 Mr. Coffin removed to\r\nCincinnati for the purpose of opening a store where goods produced\r\nby free labor only should be sold. His relations with the humane\r\nwork were maintained, and the genial but fearless Quaker came to\r\nbe known generally by the fictitious but happy title, President\r\nof the Underground Railroad. It has been said of Mr. Coffin that\r\n\"for thirty-three years he received into his house more than one\r\nhundred slaves every year.\"[344] In 1863 the Quaker philanthropist\r\nassisted in the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau. In the\r\nfollowing year and again in 1867, he visited Europe as agent for\r\nthe Western Freedmen's Aid Commission. When the adoption of the\r\nFifteenth Amendment of the Constitution was celebrated in Cincinnati\r\nby colored citizens and their friends, Mr. Coffin was one of those\r\ncalled upon by the chairman to address the great meeting. In\r\nresponse, the veteran station-keeper explained how he had obtained\r\nthe title of President of the Underground Road. He said, \"The\r\ntitle was given to me by slave-hunters, who could not find their\r\nfugitive slaves after they got into my hands. I accepted the office\r\nthus conferred upon me, and ... endeavored to perform my duty\r\nfaithfully. Government has now taken the work out of our hands.\r\nThe stock of the Underground Railroad has gone down in the market,\r\nthe business is spoiled, the road is now of no further use.\"[345]\r\nHe then amid much applause resigned his office, and declared the\r\noperations of the Underground Railroad at an end.\r\n\r\n  [344] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, 2d ed., p. 694.\r\n\r\n  [345] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, p. 712.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP\r\n\r\nshowing the lines of the\r\n\r\nUNDERGROUND RAILROAD\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nChester and the Neighboring Counties of Pennsylvania\r\n\r\n_Based on R.

Siebert, 1898]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF THE MAP OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many features of the Underground Railroad that can best be\r\nunderstood by means of a geographical representation of the system.\r\nSuch a representation it has been possible to make by piecing\r\ntogether the scraps of information in regard to various routes and\r\nparts of routes gathered from the reminiscences of a large number\r\nof abolitionists. The more or less limited area in which each agent\r\noperated was the field within which he was not only willing, but was\r\nusually anxious, to confine his knowledge of underground activities.\r\nIgnorance of one's accomplices beyond a few adjoining stations\r\nwas naturally felt to be a safeguard. The local character of the\r\ninformation resulting from such precautions places the investigator\r\nunder the necessity of patiently studying his materials for what may\r\nbe called the cumulative evidence in regard to the geography of the\r\nsystem. It is because the evidence gathered has been cumulative and\r\ncorroborative that a general map can be prepared. But a map thus\r\nconstructed cannot, of course, be considered complete, for it cannot\r\nbe supposed that after the lapse of a generation representatives\r\nof all the important lines and branches could be discovered.\r\nNevertheless, however much the map may fall short of showing the\r\nsystem in its completeness, it will be found to help the reader\r\nmaterially in his attempt to realize the extent and importance of\r\nthis movement.\r\n\r\nThe underground system, in accordance with the statement of James\r\nFreeman Clarke, is commonly understood to have extended from\r\nKentucky and Virginia across Ohio, and from Maryland through\r\nPennsylvania, New York and New England to Canada.[346] But this\r\ndescription is inadequate, for it fails to include the states west\r\nof Ohio. Henry Wilson extends the field westward by asserting that\r\nthe \"territory embraced by the Middle States and all the Western\r\nStates east of the Mississippi ... was dotted over with 'stations,'\"\r\nand \"covered with a network of imaginary routes, not found ... in\r\nthe railway guides or on the railway maps;\"[347] and in another\r\nplace he quotes the Rev. Asa Turner, a home missionary, who went\r\nto Illinois in 1830, who says: \"Lines were formed through Iowa\r\nand Illinois, and passengers were carried from station to station\r\n... till they reached the Canada line.\"[348] The association of\r\nKansas with the two states just named as a channel for the escape\r\nof runaways from the southwestern slave section, is made by Mr.\r\nRichard J. Hinton.[349] The addition of one other state, New Jersey,\r\nis necessary to complete the list of Northern states involved in\r\nthe Underground Railroad system.[350] This region, which forms\r\nnearly one quarter of the present area of the Union, constituted the\r\nirregular zone of free soil intervening between Southern slavery and\r\nCanadian liberty.\r\n\r\n  [346] _Anti-Slavery Days_, p. 81; M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive\r\n  Slaves_, p. 61.\r\n\r\n  [347] _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America_, Vol. II, p.\r\n  66.\r\n\r\n  [348] _Ibid._, p. 68.\r\n\r\n  [349] _John Brown and His Men_, p. 173.\r\n\r\n  [350] See pp. 123-125, this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe conditions that determined the number and distribution of\r\nstations throughout this region are clearly discernible even in\r\nthe incomplete data with which we are forced to be content. It\r\nis safe to assert that in Ohio the conditions favorable to the\r\ndevelopment of a large number of stations, and the dissemination of\r\nthese throughout the state, existed in a measure and combination\r\nnot reproduced in the case of any other state. Ohio's geographical\r\nboundary gave it a long line of contact with slave territory. It\r\nbordered Kentucky with about one hundred and sixty miles of river\r\nfrontage; and Virginia with perhaps two hundred and twenty-five\r\nmiles or more, and crossings were made at almost any point. The\r\ncharacter of the early settlements of Ohio is a factor that must\r\nnot be overlooked. The northern and eastern parts of the state\r\nwere dotted over with many little communities where New England\r\nideas prevailed; the southern and southwestern parts came in\r\ntime to be well sprinkled with the homes of Quakers, Covenanters\r\nand anti-slavery Southerners and some negroes; the central and\r\nsoutheastern portions contained a number of Quaker settlements. The\r\nremote position and sparse settlement of the northwestern section\r\nof the state probably explain the failure to find many traces of\r\nroutes in that region. Family ties, church fellowship, an aggressive\r\nanti-slavery leadership,--journalistic and political,--the leavening\r\ninfluence of institutions like Oberlin College, Western Reserve\r\nCollege and Geneva College, all contributed to propagate a sentiment\r\nthat was ready to support the fleeing slave; and thus Ohio became\r\nnetted over with a large number of interlacing lines of escape for\r\nfugitive slaves. The western portions of Pennsylvania and New York,\r\nand the eastern portion of Indiana shared with Ohio these favorable\r\nconditions, and one is not surprised to find many stations in these\r\nregions. The same is true of northern and west-central Illinois,\r\nwhere many persons of New England descent settled. The few lines\r\nknown in southwestern Illinois were developed by a few Covenanter\r\ncommunities. The geographical position of the most southern portions\r\nof Illinois and Indiana determined the character of the population\r\nsettling there, and thus rendered underground enterprises in those\r\nregions more than ordinarily dangerous. There may have been stations\r\nscattered through those parts, but if so, one can scarcely hope\r\nnow to discover them. The great number of routes in southeastern\r\nPennsylvania, and the stream of slave emigration flowing through\r\nNew Jersey to New York are to be attributed largely to the untiring\r\nactivity of a host of Quakers, assisted by some negroes. The\r\ncoöperation of some zealous station-keepers in the neighboring slave\r\nterritory seems to account partly for the multitude of stations\r\nthat appear upon the map between the lower Susquehanna and Delaware\r\nrivers. Whether there was any underground work done in the central\r\nand northern parts of Pennsylvania is not known; the indications\r\nare that there was not much; the stations said to have existed at\r\nMilroy, Altoona, Work's Place and Smicksburg probably connected\r\nwith lines running in a northwesterly direction to Lake Erie. This\r\nis known to have been true of the stations at Greensburg, Indiana,\r\nClearfield and intermediate points, which were linked in with\r\nstations leading to Meadville and Erie. The remoteness of New York\r\nand of the New England states from the slaveholding section explains\r\nthe comparatively small number of stations found in those states.\r\nIowa, which bordered on slave territory, had only a small number\r\nof stations, for it was a new region, not long open to occupation;\r\nand only the southern part of the state was in the direct line of\r\ntravel, which here was mostly eastward. There were a few places of\r\ndeportation in southeastern Wisconsin for fugitives that had avoided\r\nChicago, and followed the lakeshore or the Illinois River farther\r\nnorthward. A rather narrow strip of Michigan, adjoining Indiana and\r\nOhio, was dotted with stations.\r\n\r\nThere were friends of the discontented slave in the South as well\r\nas in the North, although it cannot be said, upon the basis of\r\nthe small amount of evidence at hand, that these were sufficient\r\nin number or so situated as to maintain regular lines of escape\r\nnorthward. Doubtless many acts of kindness to slaves were performed\r\nby individual Southerners, but those were not, in most of the cases,\r\nknown as the acts of persons coöperating to help the slave from\r\npoint to point until freedom and safety should be reached. That\r\nthere were regular helpers in the South engaged in concerted action,\r\nSamuel J. May, a station-keeper of wide information concerning\r\nthe Road, freely asserts. In 1869 he wrote, \"There have always\r\nbeen scattered throughout the slaveholding states individuals who\r\nhave abhorred slavery, and have pitied the victims of our American\r\ndespotism. These persons have known, or have taken pains to find\r\nout, others at convenient distances northward from their abodes\r\nwho sympathized with them in commiserating the slaves. These\r\nsympathizers have known or heard of others of like mind still\r\nfarther north, who again have had acquaintances in the free states\r\nthat they knew would help the fugitive on his way to liberty. Thus\r\nlines of friends at longer or shorter distances were formed from\r\nmany parts of the South to the very borders of Canada....\"[351] It\r\nis not easy to substantiate this statement; and all that will be\r\nattempted here is the presentation of such examples as have been\r\nfound of underground work on the part of persons living south of\r\nMason and Dixon's line. Mr. Stephen B. Weeks is authority for the\r\nstatement that \"Vestal Coffin organized the Underground Railroad\r\nnear the present Guilford College in 1819,\" and that \"Addison\r\nCoffin, his son, entered its service as a conductor in early\r\nyouth....\"[352] Levi Coffin, Vestal's cousin, helped many slaves\r\nfrom this region to reach the North before he moved to Indiana in\r\n1826.[353] In Delaware there seems to have been a well-defined\r\nroute upon which the houses of John Hunn, of Middletown,[354]\r\nEzekiel Hunn, of Camden, and Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington,[355]\r\nwere important stations. John Hunn speaks of himself as having been\r\n\"superintendent of the Underground Railroad from Wilmington down the\r\nPeninsula.\"[356] Maryland also had its line--perhaps its lines--of\r\nRoad. One route ran overland from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia.\r\nMr. W. B. Williams, of Charlotte, Michigan, throws some light on\r\nthis route. He says, \"My uncle, Jacob Bigelow, was for several\r\nyears previous to the war a resident of Washington, D.C. He was an\r\nabolitionist, and general manager of the Underground Railway from\r\nWashington to Philadelphia....\"[357] Mr. Robert Purvis tells of two\r\nmarket-women that were agents of the Underground Road in Baltimore,\r\nforwarding fugitives to the Vigilance Committee with which he\r\nwas connected in Philadelphia.[358] The Quaker City was also a\r\ncentral station for points still farther south. Vessels engaged\r\nin the lumber trade plying between Newberne, North Carolina, and\r\nPhiladelphia, were often supplied with slave passengers by the son\r\nof a slaveholder living at Newberne.[359] A slave at Petersburg,\r\nVirginia, was agent for that section of country, directing fugitives\r\nto William Still in Philadelphia.[360] Eliza Bains, a slave-woman\r\nof Portsmouth, Virginia, sent numbers of her people to Boston and\r\nNew Bedford by boat.[361] Frederick Douglass declared that his\r\nconnection with the Underground Railroad began long before he left\r\nthe South.[362] Harriet Tubman, the abductor, made use of stations\r\nat Camden, Dover, Blackbird, Middleton and New Castle in the State\r\nof Delaware on her way to Wilmington and Philadelphia.[363] The\r\ntestimony of these various witnesses seems to show that underground\r\nroutes existed in the South, but it is not sufficient in amount\r\nto enable one to trace extended courses of travel through the\r\nslaveholding states.\r\n\r\n  [351] _Recollections of the Anti-Slavery Conflict_, pp. 296, 297.\r\n\r\n  [352] _Southern Quakers and Slavery_, p. 242.\r\n\r\n  [353] _Ibid._, p. 242.

These natural routes from slavery have\r\nbeen recognized and defined by a recent writer.[364] \"One,\" he says,\r\n\"was that of the coast south of the Potomac, whose almost continuous\r\nline of swamps from the vicinity of Norfolk, Va., to the northern\r\nborder of Florida afforded a refuge for many who could not escape\r\nand became 'marooned' in their depths, while giving facility to\r\nthe more enduring to work their way out to the north star land.\r\nThe great Appalachian range and its abutting mountains were long\r\na rugged, lonely, but comparatively safe route to freedom. It was\r\nused, too, for many years. Doubtless a knowledge of that fact, for\r\nJohn Brown was always an active railroad man, had very much to do,\r\nstrategically considered, with the Captain's decision to begin\r\noperations therein. Harriet Tubman ... was a constant user of the\r\nAppalachian route in her efforts to aid escaping slaves.[365] ...\r\nUnderground Railroad operations culminating chiefly at Cleveland,\r\nSandusky, and Detroit, led by broad and defined routes through Ohio\r\nto the border of Kentucky. Through that State, into the heart of\r\nthe Cumberland Mountains, northern Georgia, east Tennessee, and\r\nnorthern Alabama, the limestone caves of the region served a useful\r\npurpose.... The Ohio-Kentucky routes probably served more fugitives\r\nthan others in the North. The valley of the Mississippi was the\r\nmost westerly channel, until Kansas opened a bolder way of escape\r\nfrom the southwest slave section.\" These were the main channels of\r\nflight from the slave states; but it must be remembered that escapes\r\nwere continually taking place along the entire frontier between the\r\ntwo sections of the Union, the drift of travel being constantly\r\ntowards those points where the homes of abolitionists or where negro\r\nsettlements indicated initial stations on lines running north to\r\nfreedom. The border counties of the slave states were thus subject\r\nto a steady loss of their dissatisfied bondmen. This condition\r\nis well represented in the case of several counties of Maryland,\r\nconcerning which Mr. Smedley obtained information. He says, \"The\r\ncounties of Frederick, Carroll, Washington, Hartford and Baltimore,\r\nMd., emptied their fugitives into York and Adams counties across\r\nthe line in Pennsylvania. The latter two counties had settlements\r\nof Friends and abolitionists. The slaves learned who their friends\r\nwere in that part of the Free State; and it was as natural for those\r\naspiring to liberty to move in that direction as for the waters of\r\nbrooks to move toward larger streams.\"[366]\r\n\r\n  [364] R. J. Hinton, _John Brown and His Men_, pp. 172, 173.\r\n\r\n  [365] Harriet Tubman has told the author that she did not travel\r\n  by the mountain route. In his book entitled _The Underground\r\n  Railroad_ (p. 37), Mr. R. C. Smedley illustrates the value of\r\n  the Alleghanies to the slaves of the regions through which they\r\n  extend: \"William and Phœbe Wright resided during their entire\r\n  lives in a very old settlement of Friends, near the southern\r\n  slope of South Mountain, a spur of the Alleghanies, which extends\r\n  into Tennessee. This location placed them directly in the way to\r\n  render great and valuable aid to fugitives, as hundreds, guided\r\n  by that mountain range northward, came into Pennsylvania, and\r\n  were directed to their home.\"\r\n\r\n  [366] _Underground Railroad_, p. 36.\r\n\r\nAlong the southern margin of the free states began those\r\nwell-defined trails or channels that have lent themselves to\r\nrepresentation upon the large map given herewith. In dealing with\r\nthe tracings shown upon this map it will be best to consider the\r\nterritory as divided into three regions, the first comprising the\r\nstates of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York; the second, the\r\nNew England states; and the third, the five states created out of\r\nthe Northwest Territory. This arrangement will, perhaps, admit of\r\nthe introduction of some system into the discussion of what might\r\notherwise prove a complicated subject.\r\n\r\nIn point of time underground work seems to have developed first\r\nin eastern Pennsylvania.[367] Regular routes of travel began to\r\nbe formed in the vicinity of Philadelphia about the middle of the\r\nfirst decade of the present century. It is said that \"some cases\r\nof kidnapping and shooting of fugitives who attempted to escape\r\noccurred in Columbia, Pa., in 1804. This incited the people of\r\nthat town, who were chiefly Friends or their descendants, to throw\r\naround the colored people the arm of protection, and even to assist\r\nthose who were endeavoring to escape from slavery.... This gave\r\norigin to that organized system of rendering aid to fugitives\r\nwhich was afterward known as the 'Underground Railroad.'\" Thus\r\nbegun, the service rapidly extended, being greatly favored by the\r\ncharacter of the population in southeastern Pennsylvania, which was\r\nlargely Quaker, with here and there some important settlements of\r\nmanumitted slaves. It was on account of the large number of runaways\r\nearly resorting to Columbia that it became necessary to have an\r\nunderstanding with regard to places of entertainment for them along\r\nlines leading to the Eastern states and to Canada, whither most of\r\nthe fugitives were bound.[368] There seems to have been scarcely\r\nany limitation upon the number of persons in Lancaster, Chester and\r\nDelaware counties willing to assume agencies for the forwarding\r\nof slaves; hence this region became the field through which more\r\nroutes were developed in proportion to its extent than any other\r\narea in the Northern states. It will be necessary to make use of\r\na special map of the region in order to follow out the principal\r\nchannels of escape and to discover the centres from which the\r\nCanada routes sprung.[369] West of the Susquehanna River Gettysburg\r\nand York were the stations chiefly sought by slaves escaping from\r\nthe border counties of Maryland. Along the western shore of the\r\nChesapeake runaways passed northward to Havre de Grace, where they\r\nusually crossed the Susquehanna, and with others from the Eastern\r\nShore found their way to established stations in the southern\r\npart of Lancaster and Chester counties in Pennsylvania. From the\r\nterritory adjacent to the Delaware the movement was to Wilmington,\r\nand thence north through Chester and Delaware counties. The routes\r\ndeveloped in the three regions just indicated formed three systems\r\nof underground travel, the first of which may be called the western,\r\nthe second, the middle, and the third, the eastern system. These\r\nsystems comprised, besides the main roads indicated in heavy lines\r\nupon the map, numerous side-tracks and branches shown by the light\r\nlines. Their common goal was Phœnixville, the home of Elijah F.\r\nPennypacker, and from here fugitives were sent to Philadelphia,\r\nNorristown, Quakertown, Reading and other stations as occasion\r\nrequired. While Phœnixville may be regarded as the central station\r\nfor the three systems mentioned, it did not receive all the negroes\r\nescaping through this section, and Smedley says that \"Hundreds were\r\nsent to the many branch stations along interlacing routes, and\r\nhundreds of others were sent from Wilmington, Columbia, and stations\r\nwestward direct to the New England States and Canada. Many of these\r\npassed through the hands of the Vigilance Committee connected with\r\nthe anti-slavery office in Philadelphia.\"[370] From this point\r\none outlet led overland across New Jersey to Jersey City and New\r\nYork; another outlet from Philadelphia, was the Reading Railroad,\r\nwhich also carried refugees from various stations along its course.\r\nHow many steam railway extensions may have been connected with\r\nthe underground tracks of southeastern Pennsylvania cannot be\r\ndiscovered. One such extension was the Northern Central Railroad\r\nfrom Harrisburg across the state to Elmira, New York.[371] Another\r\ntrans-state route in eastern Pennsylvania appears to have had its\r\norigin at or near Sadsbury, Chester County, and to have run overland\r\nto Binghamton, New York.[372] The intermediate stations along this\r\npathway are not known, although some disconnected places of resort\r\nin northeastern Pennsylvania[373] may have constituted a section of\r\nit. Lines of northern travel for fugitives also passed through Bucks\r\nCounty, but Dr. Edward H. Magill, formerly President of Swarthmore\r\nCollege, thinks these were \"less clearly marked\" than those running\r\nthrough Chester and Lancaster counties. He finds that friends of\r\nthe slave in the middle section of Bucks County generally forwarded\r\nthe negroes to Quakertown or even as far north, by stage or private\r\nconveyance, as Stroudsburg. From this point they sometimes went to\r\nMontrose or Friendsville, in Susquehanna County, near the southern\r\nboundary of the State of New York,[374] whence, together with\r\nfugitives from Wilkesbarre, and, perhaps, the Lehigh Valley, they\r\nwere sent on to Gerrit Smith, at Peterboro in central New York, and\r\nthence to Canada.[375]\r\n\r\n  [367] See pp. 33 and 34, Chapter II.\r\n\r\n  [368] R.

The most important of these seem to\r\nhave been the roads resulting from the convergence of at least\r\nthree well-defined lines of escape at Uniontown in southwestern\r\nPennsylvania from the neighboring counties of Virginia and\r\nMaryland. A map drawn by Mr. Amos M. Jolliffe, of Uniontown,\r\nshows that there were two courses leading northward from his\r\nneighborhood, both of which terminated at Pittsburgh.[376] From\r\nthis point fugitives seem to have been sent to Cleveland by rail,\r\nor to have been directed to follow the Alleghany or the Ohio and\r\nits tributaries north. Investigation proves that friends were\r\nnot lacking at convenient points to help them along to the main\r\nterminals for this region, namely, Erie and Buffalo, or across\r\nthe border of the state to the much-used routes of the Western\r\nReserve.[377] East of the Alleghany River significant traces of\r\nunderground work are found running in a northeasterly direction from\r\nGreensburg through Indiana County to Clearfield,[378] a distance\r\nof seventy-five miles, and from Cumberland, Maryland, through\r\nBedford and Pleasantville to Altoona,[379] about the same distance.\r\nThese fragmentary routes may have had connections with some of the\r\nfragmentary lines of western New York. From Clearfield an important\r\nbranch is known to have run northwest to Shippenville and Franklin,\r\nand so to Erie, a place of deportation on the lake of the same\r\nname.[380]\r\n\r\n  [376] Letter of Mr. Jolliffe, Nov. 17, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [377] Letter of John F.

Our knowledge of these outlets is derived solely\r\nfrom the testimony of the Rev. Thomas Clement Oliver, who, like\r\nhis father, travelled the New Jersey routes many times as a guide\r\nor conductor.[381] Probably the most important of these routes was\r\nthat leading from Philadelphia to Jersey City and New York. From\r\nPhiladelphia the runaways were taken across the Delaware River to\r\nCamden, where Mr. Oliver lived, thence they were conveyed northeast\r\nfollowing the course of the river to Burlington, and thence in\r\nthe same direction to Bordentown. In Burlington, sometimes called\r\nStation A, a short stop was made for the purpose of changing\r\nhorses after the rapid drive of twenty miles from Philadelphia.\r\nThe Bordentown station was denominated Station B east. Here the\r\nroad took a more northerly direction to Princeton, where horses\r\nwere again changed and the journey continued to New Brunswick. Just\r\neast of New Brunswick the conductors sometimes met with opposition\r\nin attempting to cross the Raritan River on their way to Jersey\r\nCity. To avoid such interruption the conductors arranged with\r\nCornelius Cornell, who lived on the outskirts of New Brunswick,\r\nand, presumably, near the river, to notify them when there were\r\nslave-catchers or spies at the regular crossing. On receiving such\r\ninformation they took a by-road leading to Perth Amboy, whence their\r\nprotégés could be safely forwarded to New York City. When the way\r\nwas clear at the Raritan the company pursued its course to Rahway;\r\nhere another relay of horses was obtained and the journey continued\r\nto Jersey City, where, under the care of John Everett, a Quaker, or\r\nhis servants, they were taken to the Forty-second Street railroad\r\nstation, now known as the Grand Central, provided with tickets, and\r\nplaced on a through train for Syracuse, New York. The second route\r\nhad its origin on the Delaware River forty miles below Philadelphia,\r\nat or near Salem. This line, like the others to be mentioned later,\r\nseems to have been tributary to the Philadelphia route traced above.\r\nNevertheless, it had an independent course for sixty miles before\r\nit connected with the more northern route at Bordentown. This\r\ndistance of sixty miles was ordinarily travelled in three stages,\r\nthe first ending at Woodbury, twenty-five miles north of Salem,\r\nalthough the trip by wagon is said to have added ten miles to the\r\nestimated distance between the two places; the second stage ended\r\nat Evesham Mount; and the third, at Bordentown. The third route was\r\ncalled, from its initial station, the Greenwich line. This station\r\nis vividly described as having been made up of a circle of Quaker\r\nresidences enclosing a swampy place that swarmed with blacks. One\r\nmay surmise that it made a model station. Slaves were transported\r\nat night across the Delaware River from the vicinity of Dover, in\r\nboats marked by a yellow light hung below a blue one, and were met\r\nsome distance out from the Jersey shore by boats showing the same\r\nlights. Landed at Greenwich, the fugitives were conducted north\r\ntwenty-five miles to Swedesboro, and thence about the same distance\r\nto Evesham Mount. From this point they were taken to Mount Holly,\r\nand so into the northern or Philadelphia route. Still another branch\r\nof this Philadelphia line is known. It constitutes the fourth road,\r\nand is described by Mr. Robert Purvis[382] as an extension of a\r\nroute through Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that entered Trenton, New\r\nJersey, from Newtown, and ran directly to New Brunswick and so on to\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n  [381] Conversation with Mr. Oliver, Windsor, Ont., Aug. 2, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [382] Conversation with Mr. Purvis, Philadelphia, Dec. 23, 1895.\r\n\r\nMr. Eber M. Pettit, for many years a conductor of the Underground\r\nRailroad in western New York,[383] asserts that the Road had four\r\nmain lines across his state, and scores of laterals,[384] but he\r\nnowhere attempts to identify these lines for the benefit of those\r\nless well informed than himself. Concerning what may be supposed\r\nto have been one of the lines, he speaks as follows: \"The first\r\nwell-established line of the U. G. R. R. had its southern terminus\r\nin Washington, D.C., and extended in a pretty direct route to\r\nAlbany, N.Y., thence radiating in all directions to all the New\r\nEngland states, and to many parts of this state.... The General\r\nSuperintendent resided in Albany.... He was once an active member\r\nof one of the churches in Fredonia. Mr. T., his agent in Washington\r\nCity, was a very active and efficient man; the Superintendent\r\nat Albany was in daily communication by mail with him and other\r\nsubordinate agents at all points along the line.\"[385] Frederick\r\nDouglass, who was familiar with this Albany route during the period\r\nof his residence in Rochester, describes it as running through\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, Albany, Rochester, and thence to Canada;\r\nand he gives the name of the person at each station that was most\r\nclosely associated in his mind with the work of the station.\r\nThus, he says that the \"fugitives were received in Philadelphia\r\nby William Still, by him sent to New York, where they were cared\r\nfor by Mr. David Ruggles, and afterwards by Mr. Gibbs, ... thence\r\nto Stephen Myers at Albany; thence to J. W. Loguen, Syracuse;\r\nthence to Frederick Douglass, Rochester; and thence to Hiram\r\nWilson, St. Catherines, Canada West.\"[386] Not all the negroes\r\ntravelling by this route went as far as Rochester; some were turned\r\nnorth at Syracuse to the port of Oswego, where they took boat for\r\nCanada.[387] The Rev. Charles B. Ray, a member of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee of New York City, and editor of _The Colored American_,\r\nhas left some testimony which corroborates that just given. He knew\r\nof a regular route stretching from Washington, by way of Baltimore\r\nand Philadelphia, to New York, thence following the Hudson to\r\nAlbany and Troy, whence a branch ran westward to Utica, Syracuse\r\nand Oswego, with an extension from Syracuse to Niagara Falls.\r\nNew York was a kind of receiving point from which fugitives were\r\nassisted to Albany and Troy, or, as sometimes happened, to Boston\r\nand New Bedford, or, when considerations of safety warranted it,\r\nwere permitted to pass to Long Island.[388] The lines that are said\r\nto have radiated from Albany are mentioned neither by Mr. Douglass\r\nnor by Mr. Ray, but we know from other witnesses that some of the\r\nfugitives sent to Troy found their way to places of refuge north\r\nand east. Mr. Martin I. Townsend, of Troy, writes that fugitives\r\narriving at that city were supplied with money and forwarded either\r\nto Suspension Bridge, on the Niagara River, or by way of Vermont and\r\nLake Champlain to Rouses Point.[389] It seems probable that another\r\nbranch of the secret thoroughfare followed the valley of the Hudson\r\nfrom Troy to the farm of John Brown, near North Elba among the\r\nAdirondacks. Mr. Richard H. Dana visited this frontier home of Brown\r\none summer, and was informed by his guide that the country about\r\nthere belonged to Gerrit Smith; that it was settled for the most\r\npart by families of fugitive slaves, who were engaged in farming;\r\nand that Brown held the position of a sort of ruler among them. The\r\nview was therefore credited that this neighborhood was one of the\r\ntermini of the Underground Railroad.\"[390]\r\n\r\n  [383] _Sketches in the History of the Underground Railroad_,\r\n  1879, Preface, p. xvi.\r\n\r\n  [384] _Ibid._, p. xiv.\r\n\r\n  [385] _Ibid._, p. 34.\r\n\r\n  [386] Letter of Frederick Douglass, Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D.C.,\r\n  March 27, 1893.\r\n\r\n  [387] Letter of Joseph A.

His open invitation to fugitives to\r\ncome to Peterboro gave the post he maintained great publicity, and\r\nmany negroes resorted thither. From Peterboro they were sent in\r\nMr. Smith's wagon to Oswego.[391] A little to the east and north\r\nof this place of deportation there were what may perhaps be called\r\nemergency stations at or near Mexico, New Haven, Port Ontario[392]\r\nand Cape Vincent.[393] From the place last named, and perhaps also\r\nfrom Port Ontario, fugitives took boat for Kingston.[394] A route\r\nthat came into operation much later than that with which the\r\nPeterboro station was connected was the Elmira route. In 1844, John\r\nW. Jones, an escaped slave from Virginia, settled in Elmira, and\r\nbegan, together with Mr. Jervis Langdon, a prominent citizen of the\r\ntown, to receive fugitives. A few years later the Northern Central\r\nRailroad was constructed, and supplied a means of travel through\r\nwestern New York to Niagara Falls. Underground passengers forwarded\r\nby rail from Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Williamsport were sent\r\non via the Northern Central to Canada.[395] In the counties of\r\nNew York west and south of the Elmira route the map shows some\r\ndisconnected stations and sections of Road. Not enough is known\r\nabout these to suggest with certainty their connections. It is,\r\nhowever, evident that their trend is toward the short arm of the\r\nProvince of Ontario, which is separated from the United States only\r\nby the Niagara River, with crossings favorable for fugitives at\r\nBuffalo, Black Rock, Suspension Bridge and Lewiston. In the angle of\r\nsouthwestern New York there were two routes, the objective point of\r\nwhich was Buffalo. One of these, by way of Westfield and Fredonia,\r\nhugged closely the shore of Lake Erie;[396] the other, issuing by\r\nway of the Alleghany River from Franklin, Pennsylvania, ran through\r\nJamestown and Ellington to Leon, where it branched, one division\r\ngoing to Fredonia and so on northward, whilst the other seems to\r\nhave followed a more direct course to Buffalo.[397]\r\n\r\n  [391] O.

Bragdon writes concerning the runaways\r\n  harbored by his father, near Port Ontario: \"I believe they\r\n  usually went to Cape Vincent, near the mouth of the St. Lawrence,\r\n  and were taken over to Canada from there.... I believe some of\r\n  the slaves received by him were sent on from Peterboro by Gerrit\r\n  Smith to _Asa S. Wing_ or _James C. Jackson_ (Mexico), and came\r\n  from them to our house. They steered clear of the villages, as\r\n  a rule. Our farm was favorably situated for concealing them and\r\n  helping them on.\" Letter of George C. Bragdon, Rochester, N.Y.,\r\n  Aug. 11, 1896.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Smith Miller, the daughter of Gerrit Smith, says\r\nthat in October, 1839, the \"White Slave, Harriet,\" was taken by Mr.\r\nFederal Dana from her father's house directly to Cape Vincent, and\r\nthat Mr. Dana wrote from that point: \"I saw her pass the ferry this\r\nmorning into Canada.\" Letter received from Mrs. Miller, Peterboro,\r\nN.Y., Sept. 21, 1896.\r\n\r\n  [394] The fugitive Jerry McHenry, after his rescue in Syracuse,\r\n  was hurried to Mexico, thence to Oswego, and from this point was\r\n  transported across the lake to Kingston.

Johnson, printed in the _Lakeshore and Home\r\n  Magazine_, 1885-1887.\r\n\r\n  [397] E. M. Pettit, in _Sketches in the History of the\r\n  Underground Railroad_, pp. 30, 31, 32, gives an instance of the\r\n  use of this route.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the unfavorable position for this work of the New\r\nEngland states, a considerable number of fugitive slaves found their\r\nway through these states to Canada. A part of them came through\r\nPennsylvania and New York. Smedley states, as already noted, that\r\nhundreds were sent from Wilmington, Columbia, and other points to\r\nthe New England states and Canada.[398] Another part came by boat\r\nfrom Southern ports to the shores of New England, landing at various\r\nplaces, chief among which seem to have been New Haven, New Bedford,\r\nBoston and Portland. Such was the number of arrivals and consequent\r\ndemand for transportation to a place of safety, that these four\r\nplaces became the beginnings of routes, which it has been possible\r\nto trace on the map with more or less completeness.\r\n\r\n  [398] See p. 120, this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe first of these may be called the Connecticut valley route.\r\nPresident E. B. Andrews, of Brown University, whose father was\r\nan active friend of slaves at Montague in western Massachusetts,\r\ndescribes this route as running from New York, New Haven, or\r\nNew London up the Connecticut River valley to Canada.[399] This\r\nis corroborated by some writer in the _History of Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts_, where it is noted that there was a steady movement\r\nof parties of runaways up the valley on their way to the adjacent\r\nprovinces.[400] Mr. Erastus F. Gunn, of Montague, Massachusetts,\r\nwrites that the travel along this route was largely confined to the\r\nwest side of the river, and was through Springfield, Northampton and\r\nGreenfield into the State of Vermont.[401] Fugitives disembarking\r\nat New Haven[402] went north through Kensington, New Britain and\r\nFarmington, and probably by way of Bloomfield or Hartford to\r\nSpringfield. Sometimes they came up the river by steamboat to\r\nHartford, the head of navigation, and continued their journey\r\noverland.[403] A trail probably much less used than the routes\r\njust mentioned, seems to have connected the southwestern part of\r\nConnecticut with the valley route.[404] In Massachusetts there were\r\nramifications from the valley route,[405] which may have terminated\r\namong the hills in the western part of the state, for all that one\r\ncan now discover.\r\n\r\n  [399] Letter of Mr. Andrews, Providence, R.I., April, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [400] Pp. 470, 471.\r\n\r\n  [401] Letter of Mr. Gunn, Montague, Mass., Nov. 23, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [402] Letter of Simeon E.

Barrus, Springfield, Mass.; Judge D. W. Bond, Cambridge,\r\n  Mass.; and Arthur G. Hill, Boston, Mass. See also article on\r\n  \"The Underground Railway,\" by Joseph Marsh, in the _History of\r\n  Florence, Massachusetts_, pp. 165-167.\r\n\r\nA line of Road originating at New Bedford in southeastern\r\nMassachusetts is mentioned in connection with the line up\r\nthe Connecticut valley by the Hon. M. M. Fisher, of Medway,\r\nMassachusetts, as one of the more common routes.[406] Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nBuffum Chace says that slaves landing on Cape Cod went to New\r\nBedford, whence under the guidance of some abolitionist they were\r\nconveyed to the home of Nathaniel P. Borden at Fall River. Between\r\nthis station and the one kept by Mr. and Mrs. Chace at Valley Falls,\r\nRobert Adams acted as conductor; and from Valley Falls Mr. Chace\r\nwas in the habit of accompanying passengers a short distance over\r\nthe Providence and Worcester Railroad until he had placed them in\r\nthe care of some trusted employee of that road to be transferred\r\nat Worcester to the Vermont Railroad.[407] The Rev. Joshua Young\r\nwas receiving agent at Burlington, Vermont, and testifies that\r\nduring his residence there he and his friend and parishioner, L.\r\nH. Bigelow, did \"considerable business.\"[408] South of Burlington\r\nthere was a series of stations not connected with the Vermont\r\nCentral Railroad extension of the New Bedford route. The names of\r\nthese stations have been obtained from Mr. Rowland E. Robinson,\r\nwhose father's house was a refuge for fugitives at Ferrisburg,\r\nVermont, and from the Hon. Joseph Poland, the editor of the first\r\nanti-slavery newspaper in his state, who was himself an agent of the\r\nUnderground Road at Montpelier. The names are those of nine towns,\r\nwhich form a line roughly parallel to the west boundary of the\r\nstate, namely, North Ferrisburg, Ferrisburg, Vergennes, Middlebury,\r\nBrandon, Rutland, Wallingford, Manchester and Bennington.[409]\r\nThey constituted what may be called the west Vermont route,\r\nBennington being at the southern extremity, where escaped slaves\r\nwere received from Troy, New York.[410] The terminal at the northern\r\nend of this route was St. Albans, whence runaways could be hastened\r\nacross the Canadian frontier. The valley of the lower Connecticut\r\nseems to have yielded a sufficient supply of fugitive slaves to\r\nsustain a vigorous line of Road in eastern Vermont. It was over this\r\nline the travellers came that were placed in hiding in the office of\r\nEditor Poland at Montpelier, having made their way northward with\r\nthe aid of friends at Brattleboro, Chester, Woodstock, Randolph and\r\nintermediate points. At Montpelier the single path divided into\r\nthree branches, one extending westward and uniting with the west\r\nVermont route at Burlington, another running northward into the\r\nQueen's dominions by way of Morristown and other stations, and the\r\nthird zigzagging to New Port, where a pass through the mountains\r\nadmitted the zealous pilgrims to the coveted possession of their own\r\nliberty.[411]\r\n\r\n  [406] Letter of Mr. Fisher, Oct. 23, 1893.\r\n\r\n  [407] _Anti-Slavery Reminiscences_, pp. 27, 28.\r\n\r\n  [408] Letter of Mr. Young, Groton, Mass., April 21, 1893.\r\n\r\n  [409] Letter of Mr. Robinson, Ferrisburg, Vt., Aug. 19, 1896;\r\n  letter of Mr. Poland, Montpelier, Vt., April 12, 1897.\r\n\r\n  [410] Letter of Mr. Brainerd, St. Albans, Vt., Oct. 21, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [411] Letters of Mrs. Abijah Keith, Chicago, Ill., March 28, and\r\n  April 4, 1897; letters of Mr. Poland, April 7 and 12, 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAVES IN SALEM TOWNSHIP, WASHINGTON COUNTY, OHIO.\r\n\r\nThe cave on the left was a rendezvous for fugitives.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF MRS. ELIZABETH BUFFUM CHACE,\r\n\r\nA STATION OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, VALLEY FALLS, RHODE ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus sketched in the Vermont lines of Underground Railroad,\r\nit is necessary for us to return to the consideration of the New\r\nBedford route, which had some accessory lines near its source.\r\nOne of these had stations at Newport and Providence, managed by\r\nQuakers--Jethro and Anne Mitchell with others in the former, and\r\nDaniel Mitchell in the latter.[412] Another was a short line\r\nthrough Windham County, in the northeastern part of Connecticut,\r\nto Uxbridge, where it joined the main line.[413] The Rev. Samuel\r\nJ. May, who was a resident of Brooklyn, Connecticut, in the early\r\nthirties, had fugitives addressed to his care at that time, and he\r\nhelped them on to Effingham L. Capron while he lived in Uxbridge,\r\nand afterwards when he settled in Worcester.[414] From Boston[415]\r\nwestward there were at least two paths to reach the New Bedford\r\nroad, one of these was by way of Newton to Worcester, and the other\r\nthrough Concord to Leominster. Mr. William I. Bowditch generally\r\npassed on the fugitives received at his house to Mr. William\r\nJackson, of Newton, thence they were sent by rail to Worcester.[416]\r\nColonel T. W. Higginson writes that fugitives were sometimes sent\r\nfrom Boston to Worcester,[417] while he lived in the latter place,\r\nand that he has himself driven them at midnight to the farm of\r\nthe veteran abolitionists, Stephen and Abby Kelley Foster, in the\r\nsuburbs of the city.[418] All along the short route, from Boston to\r\nLeominster and Fitchburg, stations were systematically arranged,\r\naccording to the statement of Mrs. Mary E. Crocker,[419] who was\r\none of the helpers at Leominster.[420] This was the route taken by\r\nShadrach, after his rescue in Boston.[421]\r\n\r\n  [412] Letter of James S.

Mr. Simeon Dodge, of Marblehead, Massachusetts, who had\r\nintimate knowledge of the first of these courses, gives, in an\r\nillustrative case, the names of Marblehead, Salem and Georgetown\r\nas stations;[422] and Mr. G. W. Putnam, of Lynn, gives the names\r\nof persons harboring slaves at two of these places.[423] A report\r\nof the Danvers Historical Society is authority for the statement\r\nthat Mr. Dodge, together with some of the abolitionists of Salem,\r\nmaintained a secret thoroughfare to Canada,[424] which passed\r\nthrough Danvers, and on through Concord, New Hampshire.[425] From\r\nConcord fugitives were sent north to Canterbury and Meredith\r\nRidge[426] in two known instances, and more frequently, it appears,\r\nto Canaan and Lyme. James Furber, who lived in Canaan for several\r\nyears, is said to have made trips to Lyme about once a fortnight\r\nwith refugees received by him.[427] From Lyme they may have gone\r\nnorth by way of the Connecticut valley. At Salem the coast route\r\nparted company with the New Hampshire route, and ran on through\r\nIpswich, Newburyport and Exeter[428] to Eliot, Maine, and perhaps\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\n  [422] Letter of Mr. Dodge, March, 1893.\r\n\r\n  [423] Letter of Mr. Putnam, Lynn, Mass., Feb. 14, 1894.\r\n\r\n  [424] _Old Anti-Slavery Days_, p. 150.\r\n\r\n  [425] Letter of David Mead, Davenport, Mass., Nov. 3, 1893.\r\n\r\n  [426] Letter of Judge Mellen Chamberlain, Chelsea, Mass., Feb. 1,\r\n  1896.\r\n\r\n  [427] Letter of C.

Consequently Portland became the\r\ncentre of several hidden routes to Canada. Mr. S. T. Pickard, who\r\nlived in the family of Mrs. Oliver Dennett in Portland, says that\r\nMrs. Dennett harbored runaway slaves, as did also Nathan Winslow\r\nand General Samuel Fessenden. The fugitives that came to Portland,\r\nhe says, were on their way to New Brunswick and Lower Canada, and\r\nsome were shipped directly to England.[429] Mr. Brown Thurston, the\r\nveteran abolitionist of Portland, is authority for the statement\r\nthat routes extended from Portland to the provinces, by water to\r\nSt. John, New Brunswick, and by rail to Montreal,[430] the road\r\nused being the Grand Trunk.[431] An important overland route also\r\nhad its origin at Portland. Its two branches encircled Sebago Lake,\r\nunited at Bridgton, and formed a single pathway to the northwest,\r\nand did not separate again until the eastern border of Vermont\r\nwas reached. There, at Lunenburg, one branch took its course up\r\nthe Connecticut valley to Stratford, and thence, probably, ran to\r\nStanstead, Quebec; while the other, passing more to the westward,\r\njoined the easternmost of the branches from Montpelier, Vermont, at\r\nBarton, and so entered Canada.[432] Besides, there were at least two\r\nsubsidiary routes, which were probably feeders of the \"through line\"\r\njust described. One of them ran to South Paris and Lovell;[433] the\r\nother, according to ex-President O. B. Cheney, of Bates College, who\r\nwas privy to its operations, ran to Effingham, North Parsonsfield\r\nand Porter.[434] Both Lovell and Porter are within a few miles of\r\nseveral of the stations that form a part of the Maine section of\r\nthis line, and could witnesses be found it is likely that their\r\ntestimony would sustain the view that external evidence suggests.\r\n\r\n  [429] Letter of Mr. Pickard, Portland, Me., Nov. 18, 1893.\r\n\r\n  [430] Letter of Mr. Thurston, Jan. 13, 1893.\r\n\r\n  [431] Letter of Mr. Thurston, Oct. 21, 1895; letter of Aaron\r\n  Dunn, South Paris, Me., April 9, 1896.\r\n\r\n  [432] Letter of J.

Bordering on the slave states, Missouri,\r\nKentucky and Virginia, with a length of frontier greatly increased\r\nby the sinuosities of the rivers, the states of Ohio, Indiana and\r\nIllinois were the most favorably situated of all the Northern\r\nstates to receive fugitive slaves. Not only the bounding rivers\r\nthemselves, but also their numerous tributaries, became channels\r\nof escape into free territory, and connected directly with many\r\nlines of Underground Railroad. These lines of Road are shown on\r\nthe map as starting from the Ohio or the Mississippi, but they\r\ncannot be supposed to have abruptly originated there, for in some\r\ninstances there were points south of these streams that formed an\r\nessential part of the system. It is impossible to bring together\r\nhere the numerous bits of testimony through the correlation of\r\nwhich the multitude of lines within the old Northwest Territory has\r\nbeen traced. Only a general survey, therefore, of the Underground\r\nRailroad system in the Western states will be undertaken, while\r\nseveral smaller maps of limited areas will give the details of the\r\nmultiple and complex routes found therein.\r\n\r\nConcerning the number of paths there were in Ohio it is almost\r\nimpossible to obtain a definite and correct idea. The location of\r\nthe state was favorable to the development of new lines with the\r\nsteady increase in the number of slaves fleeing across its southern\r\nborders; and, in the process of development, it was natural that\r\nthe various branches should intertwine and form a great network.\r\nTo disentangle the strands of this web and say how many there were\r\nis a thing not easy to accomplish, although an anonymous writer in\r\n1842 seems to have found little or no difficulty in arriving at a\r\ndefinite conclusion. His estimate appeared in the _Experiment_ of\r\nDecember 7, and is as follows: \"It is evident from the statements\r\nof the abolitionists themselves, that there exist some eighteen or\r\nnineteen thoroughly organized thoroughfares through the State of\r\nOhio for the transportation of runaway and stolen slaves, one of\r\nwhich passes through Fitchville, and which to my certain knowledge\r\nhas done a 'land office business.'\"[435] If the number of important\r\ninitial stations fringing the southern and eastern boundaries of\r\nOhio be counted as the points of origin of separate routes, it\r\nwould be correct to say that there were not less than twenty-two\r\nor twenty-three routes in Ohio, but in a count thus made one would\r\nfail to note the instances in which, as in the case of Cincinnati,\r\nseveral lines sprang from one locality.\r\n\r\n  [435] The _Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, p. 67.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining portion of the Northwest Territory, the number of\r\nlines was relatively not so great; and extended areas, as in the\r\nwestern and northern parts of Indiana or the southeastern part of\r\nIllinois, contained few or no lines so far as can now be discovered.\r\nIn western and northern Illinois the conditions were more favorable,\r\nand the multiplicity of routes is such that on account of the\r\nfusion, division and subdivision of roads it is impossible to say\r\nhow many lines crossed the state. In Michigan the case is not so\r\ncomplicated, and one can trace with some clearness six or seven\r\npaths leading to Detroit. Iowa, not a part, however, of the old\r\nNorthwest Territory, was traversed by lines terminating in Illinois,\r\nand therefore deserves consideration here. In the southeastern\r\npart of the state there were several short routes with initial\r\nstations at Croton, Bloomfield, Lancaster and Cincinnati, all of\r\nwhich had terminals no doubt along the Mississippi, though it has\r\nbeen possible to complete but two of the routes. In southwestern\r\nIowa, Percival and the three roads branching from it are said to\r\nhave supplied means of egress for slaves from Missouri and Nebraska\r\nthrough three tiers of counties ranging across the state in lines\r\nparallel with the north boundary of Missouri. John Brown took the\r\nnorthernmost of these parallel roads in the winter of 1858 and 1859,\r\nwhen he led a company of twelve fugitives from Missouri through\r\nKansas to Percival on their way to Chicago and Detroit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNDERGROUND LINES OF MORGAN COUNTY, OHIO. Drawn by\r\nThomas Williams.]\r\n\r\nOf the local maps, the first represents the lines passing through a\r\nportion of Morgan County, in the southeastern part of Ohio. It was\r\ndrawn by Mr. Thomas Williams, whose services in behalf of runaways\r\nmade him familiar with the location of operators in the western\r\npart of his county.[436] The area represented is twenty-five miles\r\nin length and sixteen in width at the widest part, and contains\r\nnineteen stations including the towns through which routes passed.\r\nThe irregular distribution of these stations, and the way in which\r\ntrips could be varied from one to another to suit the convenience\r\nof conductors or to elude pursuers is apparent. The fugitives that\r\ntravelled over these routes crossed the Ohio River in the vicinity\r\nof Parkersburg and Point Pleasant, in what is now West Virginia, and\r\nproceeded north twenty or thirty miles by the help of abolitionists\r\nbefore reaching Morgan County. The southern part of this county\r\nwas traversed by two parallel lines, one of which branched at\r\nRosseau and ran on in parallels to the northern part of the county\r\nwhence after sharp deflection to the west the branches converged\r\nat Deavertown; the other issued from its first station in three\r\ndivergent lines, which rapidly converged at Pennsville and were\r\nunited by a single course to the first route. In case of emergency a\r\nguide used his knowledge and discretion as to whether he should \"cut\r\nacross lots,\" skip stations, travel by the \"longest way around,\" or\r\ngo back on his track. The houses noted on the map as being off the\r\nregular routes appear to have been emergency stations and hence not\r\nso frequently used.\r\n\r\n  [436] Corroborative evidence as regards the routes of Morgan\r\n  County is found in letters from the following persons: E. M.\r\n  Stanberry, McConnellsville, O., Nov. 1, 1892; T. L. Gray,\r\n  Deavertown, O., Dec. 2, 1892; Martha Millions, Pennsville, O.,\r\n  March 9, 1892; E. R. Brown, Sugar Grove, O.; H. C. Harvey,\r\n  Manchester, Kan., Jan. 16, 1893.\r\n\r\nA special map of exceeding interest and importance is that drawn by\r\nMr. Lewis Falley, of La Fayette, Indiana, showing the underground\r\nlines of Indiana and Michigan about 1848. Mr. Falley's acquaintance\r\nwith the Road came about through the work of his father in the\r\ninterest of fugitives in La Fayette after 1841. Subsequently\r\nMr. Falley learned of the lines traversing his state through an\r\nitinerant preacher who sometimes stopped as a guest at his father's\r\nhouse. When Mr. Falley's map was received in March, 1896, the author\r\nhimself had already plotted from other testimony a number of routes\r\nin southern and eastern Indiana and in Michigan, and a comparison\r\nof maps was made. On Mr. Falley's map three main roads appear, the\r\neastern, middle and western routes. The first of these ran parallel,\r\nroughly speaking, with the eastern boundary line of the state only\r\na few miles from it, and took its rise from two lesser paths, which\r\nconverged at Richmond from either side of the state line. The second\r\nor middle route sprang from three branches that crossed the Ohio at\r\nMadison, New Albany, and the neighborhood of Leavenworth, passed\r\nnorth through Indianapolis and Logansport, and entered Michigan a\r\nfew miles east of Lake Michigan. The third or western route followed\r\nup the Wabash River to La Fayette, where it crossed the river,\r\nproceeded to Rensselaer, and thence northeasterly to the Michigan\r\nline, making its entrance to Michigan at the point where the middle\r\nroute entered that state. From the two crossing-places on the\r\nMichigan border the northern extensions of the Indiana routes found\r\ntheir way to Battle Creek, from which station one trail led directly\r\neast to Detroit, and the other, by a more northerly course, to Port\r\nHuron. In southern Indiana the eastern route was connected with the\r\nmiddle route by a branch between Greensburg and Indianapolis, and\r\nthe middle with the western by two branches, one between Salem and\r\nEvansville, and the other between Brownstown and Bloomingdale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUTES THROUGH INDIANA AND MICHIGAN IN 1848.\r\n\r\nAs traced by Lewis Falley.]\r\n\r\nIn the general map prepared by the author, the southern route\r\nthrough Michigan to Detroit, and the eastern, middle, and a portion\r\nof the western routes in Indiana on the map of Mr. Falley are\r\nduplicated with more or less completeness. The initial stations\r\nalong the Ohio River correspond in the two maps almost exactly, and\r\nmany of the way-stations seen on the one map are to be found on the\r\nother. It is not to be expected that the two maps would agree in\r\nall particulars, and some stations occur on each that are not to be\r\nfound on the other. Such differences are due to the development of\r\nnew or the obliteration of old lines and the insufficient knowledge\r\nof the draughtsmen. It is not known that a map similar to Mr.\r\nFalley's has been devised for any other state or states among the\r\nmany through which well-defined underground routes extended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIMPLE ROUTE THROUGH LIVINGSTON AND LA SALLE\r\nCOUNTIES, ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nDrawn by William B. Fyffe.]\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing made by Mr. W. B. Fyffe, an old-time station-agent\r\nof Ottawa, Illinois, the accompanying chart of a line of escape\r\nthrough Livingston and La Salle counties in Illinois is reproduced.\r\nThe portion of the trail represented is about forty miles in length,\r\nand is remarkable for the directness of its course and the absence\r\nof interlacing lines. At Ottawa, the northernmost station shown, the\r\ntrail loses these two characteristics, for it makes there a sharp\r\nturn on its way to the terminus, Chicago, and at Ottawa also it\r\nmakes a junction with several other lines from the western part of\r\nthe state.[437]\r\n\r\n  [437] For these features see the general map.\r\n\r\nA number of noteworthy features appear on the general map. The first\r\ndeserving mention is the direction or trend of the underground\r\nlines. The region traversed by these lines may be described as an\r\nirregular crescent, the concavity of which is in part filled by a\r\nportion of Ontario, Canada, which by reason of its proximity became\r\nthe goal of the great majority of runaways. In the New England\r\nstates the direction of the underground paths was, with perhaps an\r\nexception or two, from southeast to northwest, their objective point\r\nbeing Montreal. The main lines of Pennsylvania and New York ran\r\nnorth until they reached the middle part of the latter state, and\r\nthen veered off almost directly west to Canada. West of Pennsylvania\r\nthe trend of the routes was in general to northeast, being in Ohio\r\nand Indiana to the shores of Lake Erie, and in Illinois and Iowa\r\nto the southern extremity of Lake Michigan. Through central Iowa,\r\nnorthern Illinois and southern Michigan, the course of the routes\r\nwas almost directly east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NETWORK OF ROUTES THROUGH GREENE, WARREN AND CLINTON\r\nCOUNTIES, OHIO.]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the regions through which the simplest\r\nand most direct routes passed should have been those at the two\r\nextremities of the great irregular crescent of free soil, where the\r\nnumber of routes was few and the activity of the stations limited.\r\nIn the states that formed the middle portion of the crescent, it\r\nwas natural that multiple and intricate trails should have been\r\ndeveloped. The fact that slave-owners and their agents often sallied\r\ninto this region in search of missing chattels was a consideration\r\ngiven due weight by the shrewd operators, who early learned that\r\none of their best safeguards lay in complex routes, made by several\r\nlines radiating from one centre, or branch connections between\r\nroutes, by paths that zigzagged from station to station. These\r\nfeatures were characteristic, and serve to show that the safety\r\nof fugitives was never sacrificed by the abolitionists to any\r\nthoughtless desire for rapid transit. From Cincinnati, Ohio, not\r\nless than four branches of the Road radiated. One of these led to\r\nFountain City, Indiana, where it was joined by two other important\r\nlines. From this point four lines diverged to the north. At Oberlin\r\nas many as five lines converged from the south. Quincy, Illinois,\r\nwas the starting-point of four or five lines, and Knoxville, Ottawa\r\nand Chicago in the same state each received fugitives from several\r\nroutes. The region in which the devices of multiple routes and\r\ncross lines were most highly developed is, as far as known, in\r\nsoutheastern Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSome broken lines and isolated place-names occur upon the map.\r\nFor example, in Iowa, branches of the system have been traced to\r\nQuincy, Indianola, North English and Ottumwa, but beyond these\r\npoints the connections cannot be made. Examples of such incomplete\r\nsections will be found also in northern and central Illinois,\r\nin central Indiana, in western New York, in central and eastern\r\nPennsylvania and in other states. It is not to be supposed that the\r\nroutes represented by these fragmentary lines terminated abruptly\r\nwithout reaching a haven of safety, but only that the witnesses\r\nwhose testimony is essential to complete the lines have not been\r\ndiscovered. In the case of the isolated place-names, a few of which\r\noccur in the New England states, in New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana\r\nand Illinois, the evidence at hand seemed to designate them as\r\nstations, without indicating in any definite way the neighboring\r\nstations with which they were probably allied.\r\n\r\nOn the general map may be noticed a few long stretches of Road that\r\nhad apparently no way-stations. Such lines are usually identical\r\nwith certain rivers, or canals, or railway systems. It has already\r\nbeen seen that the Connecticut River served to guide fugitives\r\nnorth on their way to Canada.[438] The Mississippi, Illinois,\r\nOhio, Alleghany, and Hudson rivers united stations more or less\r\nwidely separated.[439] The tow-paths of some of our western canals\r\nformed convenient highways to liberty for a considerable number\r\nof self-reliant fugitives, and were considered safer than public\r\nroads. A letter from E. C. H. Cavins, of Bloomfield, Indiana,[440]\r\nstates that the Wabash and Erie Canal became a thoroughfare for\r\nslaves, who followed it from the vicinity of Evansville, Indiana,\r\nuntil they reached Ohio, probably in some instances going as far\r\nas Toledo, though usually, as the writer believes, striking off on\r\none or another of several established lines of Underground Road in\r\ncentral and northern Indiana. James Bayliss,[441] of Massillon,\r\nin northeastern Ohio, states that fugitives sometimes came up the\r\ntow-path of the canal to Massillon, knowing that the canal led to\r\nCleveland, whence a boat could be taken for Canada.[442]\r\n\r\n  [438] See p. 129, this chapter.\r\n\r\n  [439] See the language of Jefferson Davis, quoted on p. 312,\r\n  Chapter X; letter of A. P. Dutton, Racine, Wis., April 7, 1896;\r\n  E. M.

Sometimes, when there was not the usual eagerness\r\nof pursuit, and when the intelligence or the Caucasian cast of\r\nfeatures of the fugitive warranted it, the traveller was provided\r\nwith the necessary ticket and instructions, and put aboard the\r\ncars for his destination. The Providence and Worcester and the\r\nVermont Central railroads furnished quick transportation from\r\nNew Bedford, Massachusetts, to Canada.[443] In southeastern\r\nPennsylvania the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad carried many\r\nslaves on their way to freedom, and according to Smedley, \"All who\r\ntook the trains at the Reading Railroad stations went directly\r\nthrough to Canada.\"[444] E. F. Pennypacker often forwarded negroes\r\nfrom Schuylkill to Philadelphia over this road, and William Still\r\nsent them on their northward journey.[445] Fugitives arriving at\r\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, sometimes took passage over the Northern\r\nCentral Railroad to Elmira, New York. Mr. Jervis Langdon and John\r\nW. Jones, of Elmira, took care that underground passengers secured\r\ntransportation from Elmira to their destination. The fugitives were\r\nalways put in the baggage-car at four o'clock in the morning,[446]\r\nand went through without change to the Niagara River. The old Mad\r\nRiver Railroad bore many dark-skinned passengers from Urbana, if\r\nnot also from Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, to Lake Erie.[447] In\r\neastern Ohio the Cleveland and Western Railroad, from Alliance to\r\nCleveland, was much patronized during several years by instructed\r\nrunaways. Mr. I. Newton Peirce, then living in Alliance, had \"an\r\nunderstanding with all the passenger-train conductors on the C.\r\nand W. R. R.\" that colored persons provided with tickets bearing\r\nthe initials I. N. P. were to be admitted to the trains without\r\nquestion, unless slave-catchers were thought to be aboard the\r\ncars.[448] Indiana and Michigan are known to have had their steam\r\nrailway lines in the secret service system: in the former state\r\nthe Louisville, New Albany and Chicago Railroad was utilized by\r\noperators at Crawfordsville;[449] in the latter the Michigan\r\nCentral supplied a convenient outlet to Detroit from stations\r\nalong its course.[450] The Chicago and Rock Island Railroad from\r\nPeru, Lasalle County, Illinois, to Chicago was incorporated in the\r\nservice, so also was the Illinois Central from Cairo and Centralia\r\nto the same terminus. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad\r\nsometimes conveyed fugitives from Quincy on the Mississippi River to\r\nChicago. Two men of prominence connected with this road, who secured\r\ntransportation over its rails for many Canada-bound passengers, were\r\nDr. C. V. Dyer, of Chicago, and Colonel Berrien, chief engineer of\r\nthe road.[451]\r\n\r\n  [443] See p. 80, Chapter III.\r\n\r\n  [444] _Underground Railroad_, p. 174.

Rogers, Chicago, Ill., April 17, 1897.\r\n\r\nOf the terminal stations or places of deportation along our\r\nnortheastern boundary, there are not less than twenty-four, and\r\nprobably many more. Three of them, Boston, Portland and St. Albans,\r\nwere located in the New England states. Fugitives were probably less\r\noften sent directly to English soil from Boston than from the two\r\nother points, and in the few instances of which we have any hint,\r\nwith perhaps one exception, the passengers so sent were put aboard\r\nvessels sailing for England. The boats running between Portland and\r\nthe Canadian provinces were freely made use of to help slaves to\r\ntheir freedom, especially as the emigrants were often provided with\r\npasses. Sailing-vessels also furnished free passage, and carried the\r\nmajority of the passengers that went from Portland.[458] St. Albans\r\nwas the terminal of the Vermont line. Many fugitives were received\r\nand cared for here, and were sent on by private conveyance across\r\nthe Canada border before the Vermont Central Railroad was built.\r\nAfterwards they were sent by rail, through the intervention of the\r\nHon. Lawrence Brainerd, of St. Albans, who was one of the projectors\r\nof the steam railroad and largely interested in it financially.[459]\r\n\r\n  [458] Letter of Brown Thurston, Portland, Me., Oct. 21, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [459] Letter of Aldis O. Brainerd, St. Albans, Vt., Oct. 21, 1895.\r\n\r\nAlong the northern boundary of New York and Pennsylvania there seem\r\nto have been not less than ten resorts facing the Canadian frontier.\r\nThese were Ogdensburg,[460] Cape Vincent, Port Ontario, Oswego,\r\nsome port near Rochester, Lewiston, Suspension Bridge, Black Rock,\r\nBuffalo, Dunkirk Harbor and Erie. Doubtless the most important of\r\nthese crossing-places were the four along the Niagara River, for\r\nhere the most travelled of the routes in New York terminated. The\r\nharbors along Lake Ontario and the one on the St. Lawrence River\r\nappear to have been the terminals of side-tracks and branches rather\r\nthan of main lines of Road.\r\n\r\n  [460] \"They crossed at Detroit and at Niagara and at Ogdensburg.\r\n  Of those in New England, some went up through Vermont, some fled\r\n  to Maine, and crossed over into New Brunswick.\" F. W. Seward,\r\n  _Seward at Washington as Senator and Secretary of State_, Vol. I,\r\n  p. 170.\r\n\r\nOhio may lay claim to eight terminal stations, all comparatively\r\nimportant. The best-known of these appear to have been Ashtabula\r\nHarbor, Painesville, Cleveland, Sandusky and Toledo, although the\r\nother three, Huron, Lorain and Conneaut, may be supposed, from their\r\nlocations, to have done a thriving business. It is impossible to\r\nget now a measure of the efficiency of these various ports, for\r\nthe period during which they were resorted to was a long one, and\r\noperators were obliged to work more or less independently, and\r\nobtained no adequate idea of the number emigrating from any one\r\npoint. Custom-house methods were not followed in keeping account\r\nof the negroes exported across the Canada frontier. All that can\r\nbe said in comparing these various ports is that Ashtabula Harbor,\r\nCleveland and Sandusky, each seems to have been the terminus for\r\nfour or five lines of Road, while perhaps only two or three lines\r\nended at Toledo and Painesville, and one each at Huron, Lorain and\r\nConneaut. Concerning the port at Huron we have a few observations,\r\nmade by Mr. L. S. Stow, who lived a few miles from Lake Erie on\r\nthe course of the Milan canal, and near one of the managers of the\r\nterminal, on whose premises fugitives often awaited the appearance\r\nof a Canada-bound boat. He says: \"We used to see, occasionally,\r\nthe fugitives, who ventured out for exercise while waiting for an\r\nopportunity to get on one of the vessels frequently passing down the\r\ncanal and river from Milan, during the season of navigation. Many\r\nof these vessels passed through the Welland Canal on their way to\r\nthe lower Lakes, and after leaving the harbor at Huron the fugitives\r\nwere safe from the pursuit of their masters unless the vessels were\r\ncompelled by stress of weather to return to harbor.\"[461]\r\n\r\n  [461] The _Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, pp. 80, 81.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DETROIT RIVER, AT DETROIT, MICHIGAN, IN 1850,\r\n\r\nTHE FAVORITE PLACE FOR FUGITIVES TO CROSS INTO CANADA.\r\n\r\n(From an engraving in possession of C.

The numerous\r\nroutes of Indiana together with several of the chief routes of\r\nwestern Ohio poured their passengers into Detroit, thence to be\r\ntransported by ferries and row-boats to the tongue of land pressing\r\nits shore-line for thirty miles from Lake Erie to Lake St. Clair\r\nupon the very borders of Michigan. The movement of slaves to this\r\nregion was a fact of which Southerners early became apprised, and\r\ntheir efforts to recover their servants as these were about to\r\nenter the Canaan already within sight were occasionally successful,\r\nalthough the majority of the people of Detroit[462] and of the\r\nsurrounding districts rejoiced to see the slave-catchers outwitted.\r\n\r\n  [462] Silas Farmer, _History of Detroit and Michigan_, p. 346.\r\n\r\nThe places of deportation remaining to be mentioned are four, along\r\nthe southwestern shore of Lake Michigan, namely, Milwaukee, Racine,\r\nSouth Port and Chicago. Of these the last-named was, doubtless,\r\nthe most important, since through it chiefly were drained off the\r\nfugitives that came from Missouri over the routes of Iowa and\r\nIllinois. A single operator of Chicago, Mr. Philo Carpenter, is said\r\nto have guided not less than two hundred negroes to Canada-bound\r\nvessels.[463]\r\n\r\n  [463] Edward G. Mason, _Early Chicago and Illinois_, p. 110.\r\n\r\nThe lines of boat-service to the Canadian termini require a few\r\nwords of comment. The longest line of travel on the lakes was that\r\nconnecting the ports of Wisconsin and Illinois with Detroit or\r\nAmherstburg,[464] and was only approached in length by the route\r\nfrom Chicago to Collingwood, Ontario.[465] Five hundred miles\r\nwould be a minimum statement of the distance refugees were carried\r\nby the boats of abolitionist captains from these westernmost\r\nports to their havens of refuge. On Lake Erie the routes were, of\r\ncourse, much shorter, and ran up and down the lake, as well as\r\nacross it. Important routes joined Toledo, Sandusky and Cleveland\r\nto Amherstburg and Detroit at one end of the lake, and Dunkirk,\r\nAshtabula Harbor, Painesville and Cleveland with Buffalo and\r\nBlack Rock at the other end of the lake. Certain boats running\r\non these routes came to be known as abolition boats, with ample\r\naccommodations for underground passengers. Thus, we are told, such\r\npassengers \"depended on a vessel named the _Arrow_, which for many\r\nyears plied between Sandusky and Detroit, but always touched first\r\nat Malden, Canada, where the fugitives were landed.\"[466] Frequent\r\nuse was also made of scows, sail-boats and sharpies, with which\r\nrefugees could be \"set across\" the lake, and landed at almost any\r\npoint along the shore. Small vessels, a part of whose \"freight\" had\r\nbeen received from the Underground Railroad, were often despatched\r\nto Port Burwell in the night from the warehouse of Hubbard\r\nand Company, forwarding and commission merchants of Ashtabula\r\nHarbor.[467] Similar enterprises were carried on at various other\r\npoints along the lake.[468] So far as known, Lake Ontario had only a\r\nfew comparatively insignificant routes: at the upper end of the lake\r\nwere two, one joining Rochester and St. Catherines, the other, St.\r\nCatherines and Toronto; at the lower end of the lake, Oswego, Port\r\nOntario and Cape Vincent seem to have been connected by lines with\r\nKingston.\r\n\r\n  [464] See Chapter III, pp. 82, 83.\r\n\r\n  [465] Letter of John G. Weiblen, Fairview, Erie Co., Pa., Nov.\r\n  26, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [466] The _Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, p. 77.\r\n\r\n  [467] Conversation with Nelson Watrous, Harbor, O., Aug. 8, 1892;\r\n  conversation with J. D. Hulbert, Harbor, O., Aug. 7, 1892.\r\n\r\n  [468] The following incident given by Mr. Rush R. Sloane will\r\n  serve as an illustration: \"In the summer of 1853, four fugitives\r\n  arrived at Sandusky. ... Mr. John Irvine ... had arranged for a\r\n  'sharpee,' a small sail-boat used by fishermen, with one George\r\n  Sweigels, to sail the boat to Canada with this party, for which\r\n  service Captain Sweigels was to receive thirty-five dollars. One\r\n  man accompanied Captain Sweigels, and at eight o'clock in the\r\n  evening this party in this small boat started to cross Lake Erie.\r\n  The wind was favorable, and before morning Point au Pelee Island\r\n  was reached, and the next day the four escaped fugitives were in\r\n  Canada.\" The _Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, pp. 49, 50.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to tell how many cities, towns and villages in\r\nCanada became terminals of the underground system. Outside of the\r\ninterlake region of Ontario it is safe to name Kingston, Prescott,\r\nMontreal, Stanstead and St. John, New Brunswick. Within that region\r\nthe terminals were numerous, being scattered from the southern\r\nshore of Georgian Bay to Lake Erie, and from the Detroit and Huron\r\nrivers to the Niagara. Owen Sound, Collingwood and Oro were the\r\nnorthernmost resorts, so far as now known. Toronto, Queen's Bush,\r\nWellesley, Galt and Hamilton occupied territory south of these, and\r\nfarther south still, in the marginal strip fronting directly on Lake\r\nErie, there were not less than twenty more places of refuge. The\r\nmost important of these were naturally those situated at either end\r\nof the strip, and along the shore-line, namely, Windsor, Sandwich\r\nand Amherstburg, New Canaan, Colchester and Kingsville, Gosfield\r\nand Buxton, Port Stanley, Port Burwell and Port Royal, Long Point,\r\nFort Erie and St. Catherines. In the valley of the Thames also many\r\nrefugees settled, especially at Chatham, Dresden and Dawn, and at\r\nSydenham, London and Wilberforce. The names of two additional towns,\r\nSarnia on the Huron River and Brantford on the Grand, complete the\r\nlist of the known Canadian terminals. This enumeration of centres\r\ncannot be supposed to be exhaustive. A full record would take into\r\naccount the localities in the outlying country districts as well as\r\nthose adjoining or forming a part of the hamlets, towns and cities\r\nof the whites, whither the blacks had penetrated. The untrodden\r\nwilds of Canada, as well as her populous places, seemed hospitable\r\nto a people for whom the hardships of the new life were fully\r\ncompensated by the consciousness of their possession of the rights\r\nof freemen, rights vouchsafed them by a government that exemplified\r\nthe proud boast of the poet Cowper:--\r\n\r\n    \"Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs\r\n    Receive our air, that moment they are free!\r\n    They touch our country and their shackles fall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nABDUCTION OF SLAVES FROM THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nMost persons that engaged in the underground service were opposed\r\neither to enticing or to abducting slaves from the South. This\r\nwas no less true along the southern border of the free states\r\nthan in their interior. The principle generally acted upon by the\r\nfriends of fugitives was that which they held to be voiced in the\r\nScriptural injunction to feed the hungry and clothe the naked. The\r\nquaking negro at the door in the dead of night seeking relief from\r\na condition, the miseries of which he found intolerable and for\r\nwhich he was in no proper sense responsible, was a figure to be\r\npitied, and to be helped without delay. Under such circumstances\r\nthere was no room for casuistry in the mind of the abolitionist.\r\nThe response of his warm nature was as decisive as his favorite\r\npassage of Scripture was imperative. The fugitive was fed,\r\nclothed if necessary, and guided to another friend farther on.\r\nBut abolitionists were unwilling, for the most part, to involve\r\nthemselves more deeply in danger by abducting slaves from thraldom.\r\nThe Rev. John B. Mahan, one of the early anti-slavery men of\r\nsouthern Ohio, expressed this fact when he said, \"I am confident\r\nthat few, if any, for various reasons, would invade the jurisdiction\r\nof another state to give aid and encouragement to slaves to escape\r\nfrom their owners....\"[469] And in northern Ohio, in so radical a\r\ntown as Oberlin, a famous station of the Underground Road, we are\r\ntold that there was no sentiment in favor of enticing slaves away,\r\nand that this was never done except in one case--by Calvin Fairbank,\r\na student.[470]\r\n\r\n  [469] _History of Brown County, Ohio_, p. 315.\r\n\r\n  [470] Conversation with ex-President James H. Fairchild, Oberlin,\r\n  O., Aug. 3, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe general disinclination to induce escapes of slaves, either by\r\nsecret invitation or by persons serving as guides, renders the\r\nfew cases conspicuous, and gives them considerable interest. When\r\ninstances of this kind became known to the slave-owners, as for\r\nexample, by the arrest and imprisonment of some over-venturesome\r\noffender, the irritation resulting on both sides of Mason and\r\nDixon's line was apt to be disproportionate to the magnitude of\r\nthe cause. Nevertheless the aggravation of sectional feeling thus\r\nproduced was real, and was valued by some Northern agitators as a\r\nmeans to a better understanding of the system of slavery.[471]\r\n\r\n  [471] See the Annual Reports of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery\r\n  Society.\r\n\r\nThe largest number of abduction cases occurred through the\r\nactivities of those well-disposed towards fugitives by the\r\nattachments of race. There were many negroes, enslaved and free,\r\nalong the southern boundaries of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois and Iowa, whose opportunities were numerous for\r\nconveying fugitives to free soil with slight risk to themselves.\r\nThese persons sometimes did scarcely more than ferry runaways across\r\na stream or direct them to the homes of friends residing near the\r\nline of a free state. In the vicinity of Martin's Ferry, Ohio,\r\nthere lived a colored man who frequented the Virginia shore for the\r\npurpose of persuading slaves to run away. He was in the habit of\r\nimparting the necessary information, and then displaying himself\r\nin an intoxicated condition, feigned or real, to avoid suspicion.\r\nAt last he was found out, but escaped by betaking himself to\r\nCanada.[472] In the neighborhood of Portsmouth, Ohio, slaves were\r\nconveyed across the river by one Poindexter, a barber of the town of\r\nJackson.[473] In Baltimore, Maryland, two colored women, who engaged\r\nin selling vegetables, were efficient in starting fugitives on the\r\nway to Philadelphia.[474] At Louisville, Kentucky, Wash Spradley,\r\na shrewd negro, was instrumental in helping many of his enslaved\r\nbrethren out of bondage.[475] These few instances will suffice to\r\nillustrate the secret enterprises conducted by colored persons on\r\nboth sides of the sectional line once dividing the North from the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n  [472] Conversation with Mrs. Joel Woods, at Martin's Ferry, Aug.\r\n  19, 1892.\r\n\r\n  [473] Conversation with Judge Jesse W. Laird, Jackson, O., June,\r\n  1895.\r\n\r\n  [474] Conversation with Mr. Robert Purvis, at Philadelphia, Dec.\r\n  23, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [475] Conversation with John Evans, at Windsor, Ont., C.W., Aug.\r\n  2, 1895; John Evans was a slave near Louisville, but was given\r\n  his liberty in 1850, when his master became financially involved.\r\n\r\nAnother class of colored persons that undertook the work of\r\ndelivering some of their race from the cruel uncertainties of\r\nslavery may be found among the refugees of Canada. Describing the\r\nearly development of the movement of slaves to Canada, Dr. Samuel\r\nG. Howe says of these persons, \"Some, not content with personal\r\nfreedom and happiness, went secretly back to their old homes and\r\nbrought away their wives and children at much peril and cost.\"[476]\r\nIt has been stated that the number of these persons visiting the\r\nSouth annually was about five hundred.[477] Mr. D. B. Hodge, of\r\nLloydsville, Ohio, gives the case of a negro that went to Canada by\r\nway of New Athens, and in the course of a year returned over the\r\nsame route, went to Kentucky, and brought away his wife and two\r\nchildren, making his pilgrimage northward again after the lapse of\r\nabout two months.[478] Another case, reported by Mr. N. C. Buswell,\r\nof Neponset, Illinois, is as follows: A slave, Charlie, belonging to\r\na Missouri planter living near Quincy, Illinois, escaped to Canada\r\nby way of one of the underground routes. Ere long he decided to\r\nreturn and get his wife, but found she had been sold South. When\r\nmaking his second journey eastward he brought with him a family of\r\nslaves, who preferred freedom to remaining as the chattels of his\r\nold master. This was the first of a number of such trips made by\r\nthe fugitive Charlie.[479] Mr. Seth Linton,[480] who was familiar\r\nwith the work on a line of this Road running through Clinton County,\r\nOhio, reports that a fugitive that had passed along the route\r\nreturned after some months, saying he had come back to rescue his\r\nwife. His absence in the slave state continued so long that it was\r\nfeared he had been captured, but after some weeks he reappeared,\r\nbringing his wife and her father with him. He told of having seen\r\nmany slaves in the country and said they would be along as soon\r\nas they could escape. The following year the Clinton County line\r\nwas unusually busy. A brave woman named Armstrong escaped with\r\nher husband and one child to Canada in 1842. Two years later she\r\ndetermined to rescue the remainder of her family from the Kentucky\r\nplantation where she had left them, and, disguised as a man, she\r\nwent back to the old place. Hiding near a spring, where her children\r\nwere accustomed to get water, she was able to give instructions to\r\nfive of them, and the following night she departed with her flock to\r\nan underground station at Ripley, Ohio.[481]\r\n\r\n  [476] Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, p. 11.\r\n\r\n  [477] Redpath, _The Public Life of Captain John Brown_, p. 229.\r\n\r\n  [478] Letter from Mr. D. B. Hodge, Oct. 9, 1894.\r\n\r\n  [479] Letter from Colonel N. C. Buswell, March 13, 1896.\r\n\r\n  [480] Letter from Seth Linton.\r\n\r\n  [481] The _Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, p. 39.\r\n\r\nEqually zealous in the slaves' behalf with the groups of persons\r\nmentioned in the last two paragraphs were certain individuals of\r\nSouthern birth and white parentage, who found the opportunity to\r\nconduct slaves beyond the confines of the plantation states. Robert\r\nPurvis tells of the son of a planter, who sometimes travelled into\r\nthe free states with a retinue of body-servants for the purpose\r\nof having them fall into the hands of vigilant abolitionists. The\r\nauthor has heard similar stories in regard to the sons of Kentucky\r\nslave-owners, but the names of the parties concerned were withheld\r\nfor obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nJohn Fairfield, a Virginian, devoted much time and thought to\r\nabducting slaves. Levi Coffin, who knew him intimately, describes\r\nhim as a person full of contradictions, who, although a Southerner\r\nby birth, and living the greater part of the time in the South, yet\r\nhated slavery; a person lacking in moral quality, but devoted to the\r\ninterests of the slave.[482] John Fairfield's ostensible business\r\nwas, at times, that of a poultry and provision dealer; and his\r\nviews, when he was among planters, were pro-slavery. Nevertheless\r\nhis abiding interest seems to have been to despoil slaveholders\r\nof their human property. He made excursions into various parts\r\nof the South, and led many companies safely through to Canada.\r\nWhile Laura Haviland was serving as a mission teacher in Canada\r\nWest (1852-1853), Fairfield arrived at Windsor, bringing with\r\nhim twenty-seven slaves. Mrs. Haviland, who witnessed the happy\r\nconclusion of this adventure, testifies that it was but one of\r\nmany, and that the abductor often made expeditions into the heart\r\nof the slaveholding states to secure his companies. On the occasion\r\nof the arrival of the Virginian with the twenty-seven a reception\r\nand dinner were given in his honor by appreciative friends in one\r\nof the churches of the colored people, and a sort of jubilee was\r\ncelebrated. The ecstasies of some of the guests, among them an old\r\nnegro woman over eighty years of age, touched the heart of their\r\nbenefactor, who exclaimed, \"This pays me for all dangers I have\r\nfaced in bringing this company, just to see these friends meet.\"[483]\r\n\r\n  [482] Coffin, _Reminiscences_, pp. 304, 305; letter of Miss H. N.\r\n  Wilson, College Hill, O., April 14, 1892.\r\n\r\n  [483] Laura S. Haviland, _A Woman's Life Work_, p. 199.\r\n\r\n  In a letter dated Lawrence, Kan., March 23, 1893, Mr. Fitch Reed\r\n  gives some of the circumstances connected with the progress of\r\n  this company through the last stages of its journey. He says: \"In\r\n  1853, there came over the road twenty-eight in one gang, with a\r\n  conductor by the name of Fairfield, from Virginia, who had aided\r\n  in liberating all his father's and uncle's slaves, and there was\r\n  a reward out for him of five hundred dollars, dead or alive. They\r\n  had fifty-two rounds of arms, and were determined not to be taken\r\n  alive. Four teams from my house [in Cambridge, Mich.] started at\r\n  sunset, drove through Clinton after dark, got to Ypsilanti before\r\n  daylight. Stayed at Bro. Ray's through the day. At noon, Bro.\r\n  M. Coe, from our station, got on the cars and went to Detroit,\r\n  and left Ray to drive his team. Coe informed the friends of the\r\n  situation, and made arrangements for their reception. The friends\r\n  came out to meet them ten miles before we came to Detroit,\r\n  piloted us to a large boarding-house by the side of the river.\r\n  Two hundred abolitionists took breakfast with them just before\r\n  daylight. We procured boats enough for Fairfield and his crew.\r\n  As they pushed off from shore, they all commenced singing the\r\n  song, 'I am on my way to Canada, where colored men are free,' and\r\n  continued firing off their arms till out of hearing. At eight\r\n  o'clock, the ferry-boats started, and the station-keepers went\r\n  over and spent most of the day with them.\"\r\n\r\nNorthern men residing or travelling in the South were sometimes\r\ntempted to encourage slaves to flee to Canada, or even to plan and\r\nexecute abductions. Jacob Cummings, a slave belonging to a small\r\nplanter, James Smith, of southeastern Tennessee, was befriended by\r\na Mr. Leonard, of Chattanooga, who had become an abolitionist in\r\nAlbany, New York, before his removal to the South. Cummings was\r\noccasionally sent on errands to Mr. Leonard's store. This gave the\r\nNortherner the desired opportunity to show his slave customer where\r\nOhio and Indiana are on the map, and to advise him to go to Canada.\r\nAs Cummings had a \"hard master\" he did not long delay his going.[484]\r\n\r\n  [484] Conversation with Jacob Cummings, Columbus, O., April, 1894.\r\n\r\nThe risks and costs of a long trip were not too great for the\r\nenthusiastic abolitionist who felt that immediate rescue must be\r\nattempted. One remarkable incident illustrates the determination\r\nsometimes displayed in freeing a slave. Two brothers from\r\nConnecticut settled in the District of Columbia about the year\r\n1848. They became gardeners, and employed among their hands a\r\ncolored woman, who was hired out to them by her master. Soon after\r\nthe passage of the Fugitive Slave Law (1850) she came weeping to\r\nher employers with the news that she was to be sold \"down South.\"\r\nStirred by her impending misfortune, one of the brothers had a large\r\nbox made, within which he nailed the slave-woman and her young\r\ndaughter. With the box in his market-wagon he set out on a long,\r\narduous trip across Maryland and Pennsylvania into New York. After\r\nthree weeks of travel he reached his journey's end at Warsaw. Here\r\nhe delivered his charge to the care of friends, among whom they\r\nfound a permanent home.[485]\r\n\r\n  [485] Conversation with the daughter mentioned, now the wife\r\n  of William Burghardt, Warsaw, N.Y., June, 1894. Article on the\r\n  Underground Railroad in the _History of Warsaw, New York_.\r\n\r\nThere were ardent abolitionists living almost within sight of slave\r\nterritory that had no scruples about helping slaves across the\r\nline and passing them on to freedom. In 1836, Dr. David Nelson, a\r\nVirginian, who had freed his slaves and moved to Marion County,\r\nMissouri, and had there founded Marion College, was driven into\r\nIllinois on account of his anti-slavery views. He settled at Quincy,\r\nand soon established the Mission Institute, which was chiefly a\r\nschool for the education of missionaries. Mr. N. A. Hunt, now\r\neighty-five years old but apparently of clear mind, was a student in\r\nMission Institute in its early years. He relates an incident showing\r\nthe spirit existing in the school, a spirit that manifested itself\r\na little later in the actions of Messrs Burr, Work and Thompson.\r\nHis story is that Dr. Nelson came to him one day in the spring of\r\n1839 or 1840, and asked him to go with another student across the\r\nMississippi River and patrol the shore opposite Quincy. The students\r\nwere to make signals at intervals by tapping stones together, and if\r\ntheir signals were answered they were to help such as needed help by\r\nconducting them to a place of safety, a station on the Underground\r\nRailroad, sixteen miles east of Quincy. The station could be easily\r\nrecognized, for it was a red barn. The time chosen for crossing the\r\nriver was always a Sunday night, a time known to be the best for the\r\npersons sometimes found waiting on the other side. This detailing\r\nof a watch from the school was regularly done, although with what\r\nresults is not known.[486]\r\n\r\n  [486] Letter from N. A. Hunt, of Riverside, Cal., Feb. 12, 1891.\r\n\r\nAmong the students attending this Institute in 1841 were James E.\r\nBurr and George Thompson. These young men, together with a villager,\r\nAlanson Work, arranged with two slaves to convey them from bondage\r\nin Missouri. The abductors found themselves surrounded by a crowd of\r\nangry Missourians, and were speedily committed to jail in Palmyra.\r\nTo insure the conviction of the prisoners three indictments were\r\nbrought against them, one charging them with \"stealing slaves,\r\nanother with attempting to steal them, and the other with intending\r\nto make the attempt.\"[487] Conviction was a foregone conclusion.\r\nWork and his companions were pronounced guilty and sentenced to\r\ntwelve years' imprisonment. These men were not required, however,\r\nto serve out their terms. Mr. Work was pardoned after three and a\r\nhalf years on the unjust condition that he return with his wife and\r\nchildren to the State of Connecticut, his former residence. Mr. Burr\r\nwas released at the end of a little more than four years and six\r\nmonths, and Mr. Thompson after nearly five years' imprisonment. The\r\nanti-slavery character of Mission Institute at length brought down\r\nupon it the wrath of the Missourians. One winter night a party from\r\nMarion County crossed the Mississippi River on the ice, stealthily\r\nmarched to the Institute, and set it on fire.[488]\r\n\r\n  [487] Quoted by Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in\r\n  America_, Vol. II, p. 71.\r\n\r\n  [488] Asbury, _History of Quincy_, p. 74. The account of the\r\n  Burr, Work and Thompson case occupies pp. 72, 73 and 74 of\r\n  Asbury's volume.\r\n\r\nIn southern Indiana operations similar to those of the students of\r\nthe Mission Institute were carried on by a supposedly inoffensive\r\npedler of notions, Joseph Sider. With his large convenient wagon\r\nSider traversed some of the border counties of Kentucky, supplying\r\ngoods to his customers; one of his boxes was reserved for disguises\r\nfor negroes that wished to cast off the garments of slavery. Sider's\r\nmethod involved the use of his vehicle for long trips to the Ohio\r\nRiver, where the passengers were conveyed by boat to a place of\r\nsafety, and told to remain concealed until the wagon and team could\r\nbe transported by ferry the following morning. So simple a plan did\r\nnot excite suspicion, and served to carry fugitives rapidly forward\r\nto some line of underground traffic.[489]\r\n\r\n  [489] E. Hicks Trueblood, \"Reminiscences of the Underground\r\n  Railroad,\" in the _Republican Leader_, Salem, Ind., March 16,\r\n  1894.\r\n\r\nAmong those invasions of the South that caused considerable\r\nexcitement at the time of their occurrence, the cases of Calvin\r\nFairbank, Seth Concklin and John Brown are notable; and accounts of\r\nthem cannot well be omitted from these pages, even though they may\r\nbe more or less familiar to the reader. Mr. Calvin Fairbank came of\r\nEnglish stock, and was born in Wyoming County, New York, in 1816.\r\nHis home training as well as his attendance at Oberlin College\r\nfurnished him with anti-slavery views, but the circumstance to which\r\nhe traced his hearty hatred of the Southern institution arose by\r\nchance, when as a boy he was attending quarterly meeting with his\r\nparents. \"It happened that my family was assigned,\" he relates, \"to\r\nthe good, clean home of a pair of escaped slaves. One night after\r\nservice I sat on the hearthstone before the fire, and listened to\r\nthe woman's story of sorrow.... My heart wept, my anger was kindled,\r\nand antagonism to slavery was fixed upon me.\"[490] In the spring of\r\n1837 young Fairbank was sent by his father down the Ohio River in\r\ncharge of a raft of lumber. A little below Wheeling he saw a large,\r\nactive-looking, black man on the Virginia shore, going to the woods\r\nwith his axe. He found the woodsman to be a slave, soon gained his\r\nconfidence, and set him across the river on the raft. A few days\r\nlater Mr. Fairbank moored his rude craft, and landed on the Kentucky\r\nshore opposite the mouth of the Little Miami River. Here he was\r\napproached by an old slave-woman, who sought the liberation of her\r\nseven children. The matter was easily arranged, and after dark the\r\nseven were speedily conveyed across the river.[491]\r\n\r\n  [490] _Rev. Calvin Fairbank During Slavery Times, or How the Way\r\n  was Prepared._ Edited from his manuscript. Pp. 1-7.\r\n\r\n  [491] _Rev. Calvin Fairbank During Slavery Times_, pp. 12-14.\r\n\r\nThe rescue of Lewis Hayden and his family was the means of bringing\r\nMr. Fairbank to the penitentiary, while it opened to his friend\r\nHayden an honorable career in New England. Mr. Hayden became a\r\nrespected citizen of Boston, and helped to organize the Vigilance\r\nCommittee for the purpose of protecting the refugees that were\r\nsettling in the city; in course of time he came to serve in the\r\nlegislature of the State of Massachusetts. His wife, who survived\r\nhim, made a bequest of an estate of about five thousand dollars\r\nto Harvard University to found a scholarship for the benefit of\r\ndeserving colored students.[492] The story of Hayden's delivery and\r\nof his own imprisonment is best told in Mr. Fairbank's words: \"Lewis\r\nHayden ... was, when a young man, ... the property of Baxter and\r\nGrant, owners of the Brennan House, in Lexington. Hayden's wife,\r\nHarriet, and his son, a lad of ten years when I first knew them,\r\nwere the slaves of Patrick Baine. On a September evening in 1844,\r\naccompanied by Miss D. A. Webster, a young Vermont lady, who was\r\nassociated with me in teaching, I left Lexington with the Haydens,\r\nin a hack, crossed the Ohio River on a ferry at nine the next\r\nmorning, changed horses, and drove to an Underground Railroad depot\r\nat Hopkins, Ohio, where we left Hayden and his family.... When Miss\r\nWebster and I returned to Lexington, after two days' absence, we\r\nwere both arrested, charged by their master with helping Hayden's\r\nwife and son to escape. We were jointly indicted, but Miss Webster\r\nwas tried first and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary at Frankfort.... While my case was still pending I\r\nlearned that the governor was inclined to pardon Miss Webster, but\r\nfirst insisted that I should be tried. When called up for trial in\r\nFebruary, 1845, I pleaded guilty, and received a sentence of fifteen\r\nyears. I served four years and eleven months, and then, August 23,\r\n1849, was released by Governor John J. Crittenden, the able and\r\npatriotic man who afterwards saved Kentucky to the Union.\"[493]\r\n\r\n  [492] _Boston Weekly Transcript_, Dec. 29, 1893.\r\n\r\n  [493] The _Chicago Tribune_, Sunday, Jan. 29, 1893.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his incarceration for aiding slaves to escape, and in\r\nthe face of the heavier penalties laid by the new Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw, passed shortly after his release from prison, Calvin Fairbank\r\nwas soon engaged in similar enterprises. He declares, \"I resisted\r\nits [the law's] execution whenever and wherever possible.\"[494] A\r\nlittle more than two years after his pardon Mr. Fairbank was again\r\narrested, this time in Indiana, for carrying off Tamar, a young\r\nmulatto woman, who was claimed as property by A. L. Shotwell, of\r\nLouisville, Kentucky. Without process of law Mr. Fairbank was taken\r\nfrom the State of Indiana to Louisville, where he was tried in\r\nFebruary, 1853. He was again sentenced to the state prison for a\r\nterm of fifteen years, and while there was frequently subjected to\r\nthe most brutal treatment. Altogether Mr. Fairbank spent seventeen\r\nyears and four months of his life in prison for abducting slaves;\r\nhe says that during his second term he received at the hands of\r\nprison officials thirty-five thousand stripes.[495] Having served\r\nmore than twelve years of his second sentence, he was pardoned by\r\nacting Governor Richard T. Jacob. It was a singular occurrence\r\nthat finally enabled Mr. Fairbank to regain his liberty. Among the\r\nfriends upon whose favor he could rely was the lieutenant-governor\r\nof Kentucky, Richard T. Jacob, the son-in-law of Thomas H. Benton,\r\nof Missouri. Mr. Jacob was a man of strong anti-slavery tendencies,\r\nnotwithstanding his political prominence and his private interests\r\nas a wealthy planter. The governor, Thomas E. Bramlette, was opposed\r\nto extending the executive clemency to so notorious an offender as\r\nMr. Fairbank. Early in 1864 General Speed S. Fry was detailed by\r\nPresident Lincoln to enroll all the negroes of Kentucky, but he\r\ncame into collision with Governor Bramlette, who sought to prevent\r\nGeneral Fry from carrying out his orders. Upon receiving information\r\nto this effect the President summoned the executive of Kentucky to\r\nWashington to answer to charges; and thereupon Mr. Jacob became\r\nacting governor. On his first day in office the new executive of\r\nKentucky was accosted by General Fry with the remark, \"Governor,\r\nthe President thinks it would be well to make this Fairbank's day.\"\r\nOn the morning following, the prisoner received a full and free\r\npardon.[496]\r\n\r\n  [494] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n  [495] _Rev. Calvin Fairbank During Slavery Times_, pp. 138, 144.\r\n\r\n  [496] _Rev. Calvin Fairbank During Slavery Times_, pp. 11,\r\n  104-143. See also the _Chicago Tribune_, Sunday, Jan. 29, 1893,\r\n  p. 33.\r\n\r\nMr. Fairbank gives many interesting devices that he employed in\r\nhis work to throw off pursuit. \"Forty-seven slaves I guided toward\r\nthe north star, in violation of the state codes of Virginia and\r\nKentucky. I piloted them through the forests, mostly by night;\r\ngirls, fair and white, dressed as ladies; men and boys, as\r\ngentlemen, or servants; men in women's clothes, and women in men's\r\nclothes; boys dressed as girls, and girls as boys; on foot or on\r\nhorseback, in buggies, carriages, common wagons, in and under loads\r\nof hay, straw, old furniture, boxes and bags; crossing the Jordan\r\nof the slave, swimming or wading chin deep; or in boats, or skiffs;\r\non rafts, and often on a pine log. And I never suffered one to be\r\nrecaptured.\"[497]\r\n\r\n  [497] _Rev. Calvin Fairbank During Slavery Times_, pp. 10 and 11.\r\n\r\nAbout 1850, Seth Concklin, a resident of Philadelphia, learned of\r\nthe remarkable escape of Peter Still from Alabama to the Quaker\r\nCity. Here the runaway was most happily favored in finding friends.\r\nWilliam Still, his brother, from whom he had been separated by\r\nkidnappers long years before, was discovered almost immediately\r\nin the office of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society; and Seth\r\nConcklin soon proffered himself as an agent to go into the South\r\nand bring away Peter Still's family. The fugitive himself first\r\nvisited Alabama to see what could be done for his wife and children;\r\nbut failing to accomplish anything he gratefully accepted the\r\noffer of the daring Philadelphian. Mr. Concklin expected to assume\r\nthe character of a slave-owner and bring the Stills away as his\r\nservants; he found, however, that the steamboats on the Tennessee\r\nRiver were too irregular to be depended on. He therefore returned\r\nnorth to Indiana, and arranged for the escape of the slave family\r\nacross that state to Canada. The story of his second attempt at the\r\nSouth has a tragic ending, notwithstanding its favorable beginning.\r\nHaving made a safe start and a long journey of seven days and\r\nnights in a rowboat the whole party was captured in southwestern\r\nIndiana. A letter from the Rev. N. R. Johnston to William Still,\r\nwritten soon after the catastrophe, gives the following account of\r\nthe affair: \"On last Tuesday I mailed a letter to you, written by\r\nSeth Concklin. I presume you have received that letter. It gave an\r\naccount of the rescue of the family of your brother. If that is the\r\nlast news you have had from them I have very painful intelligence\r\nfor you. They passed on (north) from near Princeton, where I saw\r\nthem.... I think twenty-three miles above Vincennes, Ind., they\r\nwere seized by a party of men, and lodged in jail. Telegraphic\r\ndespatches were sent all through the South. I have since learned\r\nthat the marshal of Evansville received a despatch from Tuscumbia\r\nto look out for them. By some means, he and the master, so says\r\nreport, went to Vincennes and claimed the fugitives, chained Mr.\r\nConcklin, and hurried all off....\"[498] In a postscript, the same\r\nletter gave the rumor of Seth Concklin's escape from the boat on\r\nwhich he was being carried South; but the newspapers brought reports\r\nof a different nature. Their statements represented that the man\r\n\"Miller\"--that is, Concklin--\"was found drowned, with his hands and\r\nfeet in chains and his skull fractured.\"[499] The version of the\r\ntragedy given by the claimant of the fugitives, McKiernon, was as\r\nfollows: \"Some time last march a white man by the name of Miller\r\nappeared in the nabourhood and abducted the above negroes, was\r\ncaught at vincanes, Indi. with said negroes and was thare convicted\r\nof steling and remanded back to Ala. to Abide the penalty of the\r\nlaw and on his return met his Just reward by getting drowned at\r\nthe mouth of cumberland River on the Ohio in attempting to make his\r\nescape.\"[500] Just how Concklin met his death will probably always\r\nremain a mystery. McKiernon's letter offered terms for the purchase\r\nof the poor slaves, but they were so exorbitant that they could not\r\nbe accepted. Besides, it was not deemed proper to jeopardize the\r\nlife of another agent on a mission so dangerous.\r\n\r\n  [498] Letter dated Evansville, Ind., March 31, 1851.

Letter dated\r\n  South Florence, Ala., Aug. 6, 1851.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that John Brown aided fugitive slaves whenever the\r\nopportunity occurred, as did his Puritan-bred father before him.\r\nWe have no record, however, of his abducting slaves from the South\r\nexcept in the case of his famous raid into Missouri in 1858. This\r\nexploit has a peculiar interest for us, not only as one of the most\r\nnotable abductions, but as being, in a special way, the prelude of\r\nthat great plan in behalf of the enslaved that he sought to carry\r\nout at Harper's Ferry. After Captain Brown's return from the Eastern\r\nstates to Kansas in 1858, he and his men encamped for a few days\r\nat Bain's Fort. While here, Brown was appealed to by a slave, Jim\r\nDaniels, the chattel of one James Lawrence, of Missouri. Daniels\r\nhad heard of Captain Brown, and, securing a permit to go about and\r\nsell brooms, had used it in making his way to Brown's camp.[501]\r\nHis prayer was \"For help to get away,\" because he was soon to be\r\nsold, together with his wife, two children and a negro man.[502]\r\nSuch a supplication could not be made in vain to John Brown. On\r\nthe following night (December 20) Brown's raid into Missouri was\r\nmade. Brown himself gives the account of it:[503] \"Two small\r\ncompanies were made up to go to Missouri and forcibly liberate the\r\nfive slaves, together with other slaves. One of these companies\r\nI assumed to direct. We proceeded to the place, surrounded the\r\nbuildings, liberated the slaves, and also took certain property\r\nsupposed to belong to the estate.\r\n\r\n  [501] Conversation with Samuel Harper and his wife, Jane Harper,\r\n  the two surviving members of the company of slaves escorted to\r\n  Canada by Brown in March, 1859.

We moved all slowly away into the territory for some\r\ndistance and then sent the white men back, telling them to follow us\r\nas soon as they chose to do so. The other company freed one female\r\nslave, took some property, and, as I am informed, killed one white\r\nman (the master) who fought against liberation....\"[504]\r\n\r\n  [504] Sanborn, _Life and Letters of John Brown_, pp. 482, 483;\r\n  also Redpath, _The Public Life of Captain John Brown_, pp. 219,\r\n  220.\r\n\r\nThe company responsible for the shooting of the slave-owner, David\r\nCruse, was in charge of Kagi and Charles Stephens, also known as\r\nWhipple. When this party came to the house of Mr. Cruse the family\r\nhad retired. There was no hesitation, however, on the part of the\r\nstrangers in requesting quarters for the night. Mrs. Cruse, her\r\nsuspicions fully aroused, handed her husband his pistol. Jean\r\nHarper, the slave-woman that was taken from this house, asserts that\r\nher master would certainly have fired upon the intruders had not\r\nWhipple used his revolver first, with deadly effect. When the two\r\nsquads came together the march back to Bain's Fort was begun. On\r\nthe way thither Brown asked the slaves if they wanted to be free,\r\nand then promised to take them to a free country. Thus was Brown\r\nled to undertake one of his boldest adventures, one of the boldest\r\nindeed in the history of the Underground Road. With a mere handful\r\nof men he purposed to escort his band of freedmen on a journey of\r\ntwenty-five hundred miles to Canada, in the dead of winter, and\r\nsurrounded by the dangers that the publicity of his foray and the\r\nannouncement of a reward of three thousand dollars for his arrest\r\nwere likely to bring upon him. Brown and his company tarried only\r\none day at Bain's Fort; then proceeded northward by way of Topeka\r\nto the place of his friend, Dr. Doyle, five miles beyond, and\r\nthen by way of Osawattomie, Holton and the house of Major J. B.\r\nAbbot near Lawrence, into Nebraska. Lawrence was reached January\r\n24, 1859. At Holton a party of pursuers, two or three times as\r\nlarge as Brown's company, was dispersed in instant and ridiculous\r\nflight, and four prisoners and five horses were taken. The trip,\r\nafter leaving Holton, was made amidst great perils. Under an escort\r\nof seventeen \"Topeka boys\" Brown pressed rapidly on to Nebraska\r\nCity. At this point the passage of the Missouri was made on the\r\nice, and the liberators with their charges arrived at Tabor in the\r\nfirst week of February. Here, Brown met with rebuff, \"contrary to\r\nhis expectation, and contrary to the whole former attitude of the\r\npeople,\" we are told, \"he was not welcomed, but, at a public meeting\r\ncalled for the purpose, was severely reprimanded as a disturber of\r\nthe peace and safety of the village. Effecting a hasty departure\r\nfrom Tabor, and taking advantage of the protection offered by a few\r\nfriendly families on the way, he and his party of fugitives came,\r\non February 20, 1859, to Grinnell, Iowa, where they were cordially\r\nreceived by the Hon. J. B. Grinnell, who entertained them in his\r\nhouse. Brown's next stop was made at Springdale, which place he\r\nreached on February 25. Here the fugitives were distributed among\r\nthe Quaker families for safety and rest before continuing the\r\njourney to Canada. But soon rumors were afloat of the coming of\r\nthe United States marshal, and it became necessary to secure for\r\nthe negroes railroad transportation to Chicago. Kagi and Stephens,\r\ndisguised as sportsmen, walked to Iowa City, enlisted the services\r\nof Mr. William Penn Clark, an influential anti-slavery citizen of\r\nthat place, and by his efforts, supplemented by those of Hon. J.\r\nB. Grinnell, a freight car was got and held in readiness at West\r\nLiberty. The negroes were then brought down from Springdale (distant\r\nbut six miles) and, after spending a night in a grist-mill near the\r\nrailway station, were ready to embark.\"[505] They were stowed away\r\nin the freight-car by Brown, Kagi and Stephens, and the car was made\r\nfast to a train from the West on the Chicago and Rock Island Road.\r\n\"On reaching Chicago, Brown and his party were taken into friendly\r\ncharge by Allen Pinkerton, the famous detective, and started for\r\nDetroit. On March 10 they were in Detroit and practically at their\r\njourney's end.\"[506] On the twelfth the freedmen were, under Brown's\r\ndirection, ferried across the Detroit River to Windsor, Canada.\r\n\r\n  [505] Irving B. Richman, _John Brown among the Quakers, and Other\r\n  Sketches_, pp. 46, 47, 48.\r\n\r\n  [506] Irving B. Richman, _John Brown among the Quakers, and Other\r\n  Sketches_, pp. 46, 47, 48.\r\n\r\nThe trip from southern Kansas to the Canadian destination had\r\nconsumed three weeks. The restoration of twelve persons to \"their\r\nnatural and inalienable rights with but one man killed\"[507] was a\r\nresult which Brown seems to have regarded as justifiable, but one\r\nthe tragedy of which he certainly deplored.[508] The manner in which\r\nthis result had been accomplished was highly dramatic, and created\r\ngreat excitement throughout the country, especially in Missouri.\r\nBrown's biographer, James Redpath, writing in 1860, speaks thus\r\nof the consternation in the invaded state: \"When the news of the\r\ninvasion of Missouri spread, a wild panic went with it, which in a\r\nfew days resulted in clearing Bates and Vernon counties of their\r\nslaves. Large numbers were sold south; many ran into the Territory\r\nand escaped; others were removed farther inland. When John Brown\r\nmade his invasion there were five hundred slaves in that district\r\nwhere there are not fifty negroes now.\"[509] The success of the\r\nexpedition just narrated was well fitted to increase confidence\r\nin John Brown's determination, and to arouse enthusiasm among his\r\nnumerous refugee friends in Canada. The story of the adventure was\r\nnot unlikely to penetrate the remote regions of the South, and\r\nperhaps find lodgment in the retentive memories of many slaves.\r\nThe publication in the _New York Tribune_ of his letter defending\r\nhis abduction of the Missouri chattels just as he was beginning\r\nhis journey east shows that Brown was not unwilling to have his\r\nact widely known. It was almost the middle of March when Brown\r\narrived in Canada; his letter had been made public in January;\r\nit had had ample time for circulation. Before he left Kansas he\r\nsaid significantly, \"He would soon remove the seat of the trouble\r\nelsewhere,\"[510] and it was but six months after his arrival in\r\nCanada that the attack on Harper's Ferry was made.\r\n\r\n  [507] Sanborn, _The Life and Letters of John Brown_, p. 483.

This plan he had revealed to Frederick Douglass as early\r\nas 1847. It is given in Douglass' words: \"'The true object to be\r\nsought,' said Brown, 'is first of all to destroy the money value of\r\nslave property; and that can only be done by rendering such property\r\ninsecure. My plan then is to take at first about twenty-five picked\r\nmen, and begin on a small scale; supply them arms and ammunition;\r\npost them in squads of five on a line of twenty-five miles, the\r\nmost persuasive and judicious of whom shall go down to the fields\r\nfrom time to time, as opportunity offers, and induce the slaves to\r\njoin them, seeking and selecting the most restless and daring.'...\r\nWith care and enterprise he thought he could soon gather a force\r\nof one hundred hardy men.... When these were properly drilled, ...\r\nthey would run off the slaves in larger numbers, retain the brave\r\nand strong ones in the mountains, and send the weak and timid to\r\nthe North by the Underground Railroad: his operations would be\r\nenlarged with increasing numbers, and would not be confined to one\r\nlocality.... 'If,' said Brown, 'we could drive slavery out of _one\r\ncounty_, ... it would weaken the system throughout the state.' The\r\nenemy's country would afford subsistence, the fastnesses of the\r\nAlleghanies abundant protection, and a series of stations through\r\nPennsylvania to the Canadian border a means of egress for timid\r\nslaves.\"[511]\r\n\r\n  [511] _Life of Frederick Douglass_, 1881, pp. 280, 281 and 318,\r\n  319. Also Hinton, _John Brown and His Men_, pp. 30, 31, 32.\r\n\r\nThe plot, as disclosed eleven years later to Richard J. Hinton\r\n(September, 1858) by Brown's lieutenant, Kagi, contains some\r\nadditional details of interest. Hinton says: \"The mountains of\r\nVirginia were named as the place of refuge, and as a country\r\nadmirably adapted in which to carry on a guerilla warfare. In the\r\ncourse of the conversation, Harper's Ferry was mentioned as a point\r\nto be seized--but not held--on account of the arsenal. The white\r\nmembers of the company were to act as officers of different guerilla\r\nbands, which, under the general command of John Brown, were to be\r\ncomposed of Canadian refugees, and the Virginian slaves who would\r\njoin them.... They anticipated, after the first blow had been\r\nstruck, that, by the aid of the free and Canadian negroes who would\r\njoin them, they could inspire confidence in the slaves, and induce\r\nthem to rally. No intention was expressed of gathering a large\r\nbody of slaves, and removing them to Canada. On the contrary, Kagi\r\nclearly stated, in answer to my inquiries, that the design was to\r\nmake the fight in the mountains of Virginia, extending it to North\r\nCarolina and Tennessee, and also to the swamps of South Carolina,\r\nif possible. Their purpose was not the expatriation of one or a\r\nthousand slaves, but their liberation in the states wherein they\r\nwere born, and were now held in bondage.... Kagi spoke of having\r\nmarked out a chain of counties extending continuously through South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. He had traveled over\r\na large portion of the region indicated, and from his own personal\r\nknowledge and with the assistance of the Canadian negroes who had\r\nescaped from those States, they had arranged a general plan of\r\nattack.... They expected to be speedily and constantly reinforced;\r\nfirst, by the arrival of those men who, in Canada, were anxiously\r\nlooking and praying for the time of deliverance, and then by the\r\nslaves themselves.... The constitution adopted at Chatham [in the\r\nspring of 1858] was intended as the framework of organization\r\namong the emancipationists, to enable the leaders to effect a more\r\ncomplete control of their forces....\"[512] A comparison of these two\r\nversions of Brown's plan of liberation leads to the conclusion that\r\nthe abduction of slaves to the North was a measure to which the\r\nliberator never attached more importance than as a means of ridding\r\nhis men of the care of helpless slaves; the brave he would use in\r\norganizing an insurrection amid the mountains of the Southern states\r\nthat should wipe away the curse of slavery from the country.\r\n\r\n  [512] Hinton, _John Brown and His Men_, Appendix, pp. 673, 674,\r\n  675. Also Redpath, _The Public Life of Captain John Brown_, pp.\r\n  203, 204, 206.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the occasion, if not the cause, of\r\nJohn Brown's raid into Missouri was the solicitation of aid by a\r\nslave for himself and companions. Such prayers for succor were not\r\ninfrequently addressed to abolitionists by those in bonds or by\r\ntheir refugee friends. In the anti-slavery host there were many\r\nwhose principles wavered not under any test applied to them, and\r\nwhose impulses urged them upon humanitarian missions, however hemmed\r\nin by difficulties and dangers. Among those who heard and answered\r\nthe cry of the slave were the Rev. Charles T. Torrey, Captain\r\nJonathan Walker, Mrs. Laura S. Haviland, Captain Daniel Drayton,\r\nRichard Dillingham, William L. Chaplin and Josiah Henson.\r\n\r\nThe variety of persons represented in this short, incomplete list\r\nis interesting: Mr. Torrey was a Congregational clergyman of New\r\nEngland stock, and had been educated at Yale College; Messrs. Walker\r\nand Drayton were masters of sailing vessels, and came from the\r\nstates of Massachusetts and New Jersey respectively; Mrs. Haviland\r\nwas a Wesleyan Methodist, who founded a school or institute in\r\nsoutheastern Michigan for both white and colored persons; Richard\r\nDillingham was a Quaker school-teacher in Cincinnati, Ohio; William\r\nL. Chaplin began his professional life as a lawyer in eastern\r\nMassachusetts, but soon became the editor of an anti-slavery\r\nnewspaper; and Josiah Henson was a fugitive slave, one of the\r\nfounders of the Dawn Institute in Canada West. With the exception of\r\nthe last named they were white persons, whose sense of the injustice\r\nof slavery caused them to take a stand that shut them out of that\r\nconventionally respectable society to which their birth, education\r\nand talents would have admitted them.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Charles T. Torrey resigned from the pastorate of a\r\nCongregational church in Providence, Rhode Island, and relinquished\r\nease and quiet to engage in the anti-slavery struggle then\r\nagitating the country. He became a lecturer and a newspaper\r\ncorrespondent, and, early in the forties, the editor of a paper\r\ncalled _The Patriot_, at Albany, New York. While acting as\r\nWashington correspondent for several Northern papers he attended\r\na convention of slave-owners at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1842, and\r\nwas thrust into jail on the score of being an abolitionist. He was\r\nreleased after several days, having been placed under bonds to\r\nkeep the peace. While in prison he solemnly reconsecrated himself\r\nto the work of freeing the slaves. Within a year from this time\r\na refugee entreated Mr. Torrey to help him bring his wife and\r\nchildren from Virginia. The errand was undertaken, but came to a\r\nmost mournful end. Arrested and imprisoned, Mr. Torrey with others\r\nattempted to break jail; he was betrayed, however, and at length,\r\nDecember 30, 1843, sentenced to the penitentiary for six years.\r\nUnder the severities of prison life Mr. Torrey's health gave way.\r\nHis pardon was sought by friends, but mercy was withheld from a\r\nman the depth of whose conviction made recantation impossible. In\r\nDecember, 1844, he wrote: \"I cannot afford to concede any truth\r\nor principle to get out of prison. I am not rich enough.\" While\r\nhis trial was pending he wrote his friend, Henry B. Stanton: \"If I\r\nam a guilty man, I am a very guilty one; for I have aided nearly\r\nfour hundred slaves to escape to freedom, the greater part of\r\nwhom would probably, but for my exertions, have died in slavery.\"\r\nConcerning this confession Henry Wilson writes: \"This statement was\r\ncorroborated by the testimony of Jacob Gibbs, a colored man, who\r\nwas Mr. Torrey's chief assistant in his efforts.\"[513] On May 9,\r\n1846, Mr. Torrey died in prison. In death as in life, the lesson\r\nof the clergyman's career proclaimed but one truth, the injustice\r\nof slavery. When the remains of Mr. Torrey were conveyed to Boston\r\nfor interment in the beautiful cemetery at Mt. Auburn, the use of\r\nPark Street Church, at first granted, was later refused to the\r\nbrother-in-law of the dead minister, although as a worshipper he\r\nwas entitled to Christian courtesy. Tremont Temple was procured for\r\nthe funeral services, and was thronged by a multitude eager to\r\ndo honor to a life of self-sacrifice, and show disapproval of the\r\naffront to the dead. A large meeting in Faneuil Hall on the evening\r\nof the funeral day paid tribute to the memory of the liberator. The\r\noccasion was made memorable by a poem by James Russell Lowell, and\r\naddresses by General Fessenden of Maine, Henry B. Stanton and Dr.\r\nWalter Channing. Whittier wrote: \"His work for the poor and helpless\r\nwas well and nobly done. In the wild woods of Canada, around many\r\na happy fireside and holy family altar, his name is on the lips\r\nof God's poor. He put his soul in their soul's stead; he gave his\r\nlife for those who had no claim on his love save that of human\r\nbrotherhood.\"[514]\r\n\r\n  [513] Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America_, Vol.\r\n  II, p. 80.\r\n\r\n  [514] Quoted by Wilson, in his _History of the Rise and Fall of\r\n  the Slave Power in America_, Vol. II, p. 80.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, the year after Mr. Torrey's disastrous attempt to abduct\r\na slave-family, Captain Jonathan Walker was made a victim of the\r\nlaw on account of friendly offices undertaken in behalf of some\r\ntrusting negroes. Once, while on the coast of Florida, Mr. Walker\r\nconsented to ferry seven slaves from Pensacola to one of the\r\nneighboring Bahama Islands, where they might enjoy the freedom\r\nvouchsafed by English law. In the open boat used for the purpose\r\nCaptain Walker suffered sunstroke, and on this account his craft was\r\noverhauled, and the escaping party was taken into custody. After two\r\ntrials Captain Walker was condemned to punishments that remind one\r\nstrongly of the barbarous penalties inflicted upon offenders in the\r\nreign of Charles the First of England: he was sentenced to stand\r\nin the pillory; to be branded on the hand with the letters S. S.\r\n(slave-stealer); to pay a fine and serve a term of imprisonment for\r\neach slave assisted; to pay the costs of prosecution; and to stand\r\ncommitted until his fines should be paid. His treatment in prison\r\nwas brutal, but he was not obliged to endure it long, for, by the\r\nintervention of friends, his fines were paid, and he was released\r\nin the summer of 1848. Subjected to indignities and disgrace in the\r\nSouth, Captain Walker was the recipient of many demonstrations of\r\napproval on his return to the North. Whittier blazoned his stigmas\r\ninto a prophecy of deliverance for the slave. In a poem of welcome\r\nthe distinguished Quaker wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Then lift that manly right hand, bold ploughman of the wave,\r\n    Its branded palm shall prophesy 'Salvation to the Slave.'\r\n    Hold up its fire-wrought language that whoso reads may feel\r\n    His heart swell strong within him, his sinews change to steel.\"[515]\r\n\r\nThese words were set to music by Mr. George W. Clark, and sung by\r\nhim with thrilling effect at many anti-slavery gatherings throughout\r\nNew England. Mr. Walker became at once a conspicuous witness against\r\nthe slave power in the great trial that was then going forward at\r\nthe bar of public opinion. At Providence, Rhode Island, his return\r\nfrom the Florida prison was heralded, and a large reception was\r\ngiven him, attended by the Hon. Owen Lovejoy, brother of the martyr\r\nLovejoy, Milton Clark, the white slave, and Lewis, his brother.\r\nIt is said that three thousand people crowded the seats, aisles\r\nand doorways of the reception hall. In company with Mr. George W.\r\nClark, Captain Walker was drafted into the work of arousing the\r\nmasses, and the two agitators received a cordial hearing at many New\r\nEngland meetings. Doubtless the recital of the Captain's experiences\r\nintensified anti-slavery feeling throughout the Northern states.[516]\r\n\r\n  [515] _Liberator_, Aug. 15, 1845, \"The Branded Hand,\" quoted in\r\n  part by Wilson, _History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power\r\n  in America_, Vol. II, p. 83; Whittier's _Poetical Works_, Vol.\r\n  III, Riverside edition, 1896, p. 114.\r\n\r\n  [516] Reminiscences written by George W. Clark, by request, have\r\n  been used to secure an intimate acquaintance with some of the men\r\n  engaged in the underground service.\r\n\r\nAbout 1847, Mrs. Laura S. Haviland accepted a mission to find\r\nthe family of one John White, a slave, who had escaped from the\r\nSouth and was serving as a farm-hand in the neighborhood of Mrs.\r\nHaviland's school in southeastern Michigan. Mrs. Haviland went to\r\nCincinnati where she consulted with the Vigilance Committee, and\r\nthence to Rising Sun, Indiana, to secure the services of several\r\nof John White's colored friends. Here a plan was formed for Mrs.\r\nHaviland to go into Kentucky to the plantation where the family\r\nlived, and, disguised as a berry picker, see the wife, inform her\r\nof her husband's whereabouts, and offer to assist in her rescue.\r\nAccomplishing this errand and returning across the border into\r\nIndiana, Mrs. Haviland awaited the slave-woman's appearance; but her\r\nescape had been prevented by the vigilance evoked on account of the\r\noperations of counterfeiters in Kentucky. Then John White started\r\nSouth intent on saving his wife and children from slavery, but his\r\nefforts also were unsuccessful, and he was thrown into a Kentucky\r\njail. However, he was soon released by Laura Haviland, who purchased\r\nhim for three hundred and fifty dollars.[517]\r\n\r\n  [517] Laura S. Haviland, _A Woman's Life Work_, pp. 91-110.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1847, Captain Daniel Drayton sailed to Washington\r\nwith a cargo of oysters, and while his boat was lying at the wharf\r\nhe was cautiously approached by a negro, who wanted to get passage\r\nNorth for a woman and five children. The negro said the woman was\r\na slave but that she had, under an agreement with her master, more\r\nthan paid for her liberty, and when she asked for her \"free papers\"\r\nthe master only answered by threatening to sell her South.[518]\r\nCaptain Drayton allowed the woman and her children and a niece\r\nto stow themselves on board his vessel, and he soon landed them\r\nat Frenchtown, to the great joy of the woman's husband, who was\r\nawaiting them there.\r\n\r\n  [518] _Personal Memoir of Daniel Drayton_, 1853, p. 23.\r\n\r\nIt was by the suggestion of these fugitives that Captain Drayton\r\nundertook his important expedition with the schooner Pearl in 1848.\r\nOn the evening of April 18 his boat was made fast at one of the\r\nWashington docks ready to receive a company of fugitives. The time\r\nseemed auspicious. The establishment of the new French Republic\r\nwas being celebrated in the city by a grand torchlight procession,\r\nand slaves were left for the most part to their own devices. Thus\r\nfavored, a large number escaped to the small craft of Captain\r\nDrayton and were carefully stowed away. The start was made without\r\nincident, and the vessel continued quietly on her course to the\r\nmouth of the Potomac; there, contrary winds were encountered, and\r\nthe _Pearl_ was brought to shelter in Cornfield Harbor, one hundred\r\nand forty miles from Washington. The disappearance of seventy-six\r\nslaves at one time caused great excitement at the Capitol. The\r\nmethod of their departure was revealed by a colored hackman, who\r\nhad driven two of the fugitives to the wharf. An armed steamer was\r\nsent in pursuit, and the _Pearl_ was obliged to surrender. Her\r\narrival under guard at Washington was the occasion for rejoicing\r\nto an infuriated mob of several thousand persons. The slaves were\r\ncommitted to jail as runaways; their helpers were with difficulty\r\nprotected from murderous violence, and were escorted to the city\r\nprison. Under instructions from the district attorney twenty-four\r\nindictments were found against both Captain Drayton and his mate,\r\nMr. Sayres. When the trial began in July, the list of indictments\r\npresented comprised forty-one counts against each of these\r\nprisoners. Three persons were prosecuted; and the aggregate amount\r\nof their bail was two hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.\r\nAfter two trials the accused were heavily sentenced, and remanded\r\nto jail until their fines should be paid. The sentence passed upon\r\nCaptain Drayton required the payment of fines and costs together\r\namounting to ten thousand and sixty dollars, and until paid the\r\nprisoner must remain in jail indefinitely.[519] His accomplices were\r\ntreated with equal severity. Such penalties were accounted monstrous\r\nby the friends of the convicted, and efforts were constantly made\r\nto have the sentences mitigated or revoked. In 1852 Senator Sumner\r\ninterested himself in behalf of the imprisoned liberators; and\r\nPresident Fillmore was induced to grant them an unconditional pardon.\r\n\r\n  [519] _Personal Memoir of Daniel Drayton_, p. 102.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of these events at the national capital during\r\na session of Congress, gave them a significance they would not\r\notherwise have had. That they would become the subject of much\r\nfierce debate was assured by the presence in Congress of such\r\nchampions as Messrs. Giddings and Hale for the anti-slavery party,\r\nand Messrs. Foote, Toombs, Calhoun and Davis for the pro-slavery\r\nparty. Mr. Calhoun expressed the view of the South when, speaking\r\nupon a resolution brought before the Senate by Mr. Hale, April 20,\r\nhe recorded himself as being in favor of an act making penal \"these\r\natrocities, these piratical attempts, these wholesale captures,\r\nthese robberies of seventy odd of our slaves at a single grasp.\"\r\nIn this and in similar utterances made at the time, he foreshadowed\r\nthe determination of the South to have a law that would restrain if\r\npossible from all temptations to aid or abet the escape of slaves.\r\nThe result of this determination is seen in the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nof 1850.\r\n\r\nThis notable voyage of the _Pearl_, which caused so great an\r\nexcitement at the time, has been frequently chronicled, while the\r\nexperiences of the young Quaker, Richard Dillingham, have been\r\nseldom recounted, though marked by the same elements of daring\r\nand resignation. In December, 1848, the close of the year of the\r\n_Pearl_'s adventure, Mr. Dillingham was solicited by some colored\r\npeople in Cincinnati, Ohio, to go to Tennessee and bring away their\r\nrelatives, who were slaves under a \"hard master\" at Nashville. He\r\nentered upon the project, made his way into the very heart of the\r\nSouth and arranged with the slaves for their escape. At the time\r\nappointed his three protégés were placed in a closed carriage and\r\ndriven rapidly away, Mr. Dillingham following on horseback. The\r\nparty got as far as Cumberland bridge, where they were betrayed by\r\na colored man in whom confidence had been placed, and the fugitives\r\nand their benefactor were arrested. Mr. Dillingham was committed\r\nto jail, and his bail was fixed at seven thousand dollars. At his\r\ntrial, which occurred April 12, 1849, Dillingham confessed, and\r\nasked for clemency, urging by way of explanation the dependence\r\nof his aged parents upon him as a stay and protection. As to the\r\ncrime for which he was held he said frankly: \"I have violated your\r\nlaws.... But I was prompted to it by feelings of humanity. It has\r\nbeen suspected ... that I was leagued with a fraternity who are\r\ncombined for the purpose of committing such offences as the one with\r\nwhich I am charged. But ... the impression is false, I alone am\r\nguilty, I alone committed the offence, and I alone must suffer the\r\npenalty....\" Yielding to his plea for clemency the jury returned a\r\nverdict for three years in the penitentiary, the mildest sentence\r\nallowed by the law for the offence. The _Nashville Daily Gazette_\r\nof April 13 did not conceal the fact that Mr. Dillingham belonged\r\nto a respectable family, and stated that he was not without the\r\nsympathy of those who attended the trial.[520] The prisoner himself\r\nwas most grateful for the consideration shown him, and, in a letter\r\nto his betrothed written two days after his trial, he spoke of his\r\nshort sentence with the deepest gratitude and thankfulness toward\r\nthe court and jury and the prosecutors themselves. \"My sentence,\" he\r\nadded, \"is far more lenient than my most sanguine hopes have ever\r\nanticipated.\"[521] The termination of the imprisonment of Dillingham\r\nwas most melancholy. Separated from his aged parents, to whom he was\r\ndevoted, and from the woman that was to have become his wife, his\r\nhealth soon proved unequal to the severe experiences of prison life;\r\nhis keepers after nine months gave him respite from heavy work about\r\nthe prison, and assigned him the place of steward in the hospital.\r\nHe had not long been in his new station when cholera broke out\r\namong the convicts, and his services were in constant demand. His\r\nstrength was soon exhausted, and about the first of August, 1850, he\r\nsuccumbed to the dread epidemic raging in the prison.[522]\r\n\r\n  [520] A. L. Benedict, _Memoir of Richard Dillingham_, 1852, p.\r\n  18. Also Harriet Beecher Stowe, _A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin_, pp.\r\n  58, 59.\r\n\r\n  [521] A. L. Benedict, _Memoir of Richard Dillingham_, p. 18.\r\n\r\n  [522] This account of Richard Dillingham is based on the _Memoir_\r\n  written by his friend, A. L. Benedict, a Quaker, and published\r\n  in 1852. Abridged versions of this memoir will be found in the\r\n  _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, Appendix, pp. 713-718; and Howe's\r\n  _Historical Collections of Ohio_, Vol. II, p. 590.\r\n\r\nIt was the year in which young Dillingham came to his melancholy\r\nend that Mr. William L. Chaplin was found guilty of an offence\r\nsimilar to that for which Dillingham suffered.[523] When Mr.\r\nCharles T. Torrey, editor of the _Albany Patriot_, was sent to the\r\nMaryland penitentiary for aiding slaves to escape, Mr. Chaplin\r\nassumed control of Mr. Torrey's paper. Like his predecessor, Mr.\r\nChaplin spent part of his time in the city of Washington reporting\r\ncongressional proceedings for the _Patriot_, and like him could not\r\nbe deaf to an entreaty in behalf of slaves. In 1850 Mr. Chaplin\r\nwas prevailed upon to attempt the release from bondage of two\r\nnegroes, one the property of Robert Toombs, the other, of Alexander\r\nH. Stephens. The sequel to this enterprise is thus recounted by\r\nMr. George W. Clark, an intimate friend of General Chaplin's:\r\n\"Suspicion was somehow awakened and watch set; the General was\r\nintercepted, arrested and imprisoned, and the attempt failed. The\r\nGeneral gave bail, Secretary Seward being on his bond for five\r\nthousand dollars. While passing through Baltimore on his return\r\nhome he was rearrested and put into ... prison there, on a charge\r\nof aiding slaves to escape from that state. The bonds required\r\nwere twenty thousand dollars.... It was arranged that William R.\r\nSmith, a noble and generous-hearted Quaker, and George W. Clark\r\nshould traverse the State and appeal to the friends of humanity for\r\ncontributions to save the General from the fate we feared awaited\r\nhim, for if his case went to trial he would probably be sentenced\r\nto fifteen years in their State Prison, which would no doubt amount\r\nto a death sentence. William R. Smith and I went to work in live\r\nearnest. An abolition merchant, Mr. Chittenden of New York, gave us\r\nthree thousand dollars, the always giving Gerrit Smith gave us five\r\nthousand, other friends gave us two thousand, but we still lacked\r\nten thousand.... We were in great distress and anxiety over the\r\nextreme situation when the generous Gerrit Smith voluntarily came\r\nagain to the rescue and advanced the other ten thousand dollars.\"\r\nIt was in this way, through the most open-handed generosity of his\r\nfriends, that Mr. Chaplin was enabled to go free after being in jail\r\nonly five months. Prudence dictated the sacrificing of the excessive\r\nbail rather than the braving of fortune through a trial certain to\r\nend in conviction.\r\n\r\n  [523] Wilson, _History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in\r\n  America_, Vol. II, pp. 80-82.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far considered the recorded efforts toward the\r\nabduction of slaves made by six persons in response to the entreaty\r\nof the slaves concerned or of some of their friends. It is\r\nnoteworthy that in the case of five of these persons their efforts,\r\nfirst or last, were calamitous, and that all were white persons. We\r\ncome now to the case of Josiah Henson, exceptional in the series,\r\nby reason of the uniform success of his endeavors, and because\r\nof his race connections. Born and bred a slave, Henson at length\r\nresolved to extricate himself and family from the abjectness of\r\ntheir situation. \"With a degree of prudence, courage and address,\"\r\nsays Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, \"which can scarcely find a parallel\r\nin any history, he managed with his wife and two children to escape\r\nto Canada. Here he learned to read, and, by his superior talent\r\nand capacity for management, laid the foundation for the fugitive\r\nsettlement of Dawn....\"[524] The possession of the qualities\r\nindicated in this characterization of Mr. Henson rendered him equal\r\nto such emergencies as arose in his missions to the South in search\r\nof friends and relatives of Canadian refugees.\r\n\r\n  [524] _A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin_, 1853, Boston edition of 1896,\r\n  pp. 274, 275; also _Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_, 1858,\r\n  chaps. xii, xiii.\r\n\r\nMr. Henson has left us the record of two journeys to the Southern\r\nstates, made at the instance of James Lightfoot, a refugee of Fort\r\nErie, Ontario.[525] Lightfoot had a number of relatives in slavery\r\nnear Maysville, Kentucky, and was ready to use the little property\r\nhe had accumulated during the short period of his freedom in\r\nsecuring the liberation of his family. Beginning the journey alone,\r\nMr. Henson travelled on foot about four hundred miles through New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania and Ohio, to his destination. The fact that the\r\nLightfoots decided it to be unsafe to make their escape at this\r\ntime did not prevent their visitor from agreeing to come a year\r\nlater for them, nor did it prevent him from returning to Canada\r\nwith companions. He went nearly fifty miles into the interior of\r\nKentucky, where, as he learned, there was a large party eager to\r\nset out for a land of freedom, but waiting until an experienced\r\nleader should appear. In Bourbon County he found about thirty\r\nfugitives collected from different states, and with these he started\r\nnorthward. Mr. Henson gives his itinerary in the following words:\r\n\"We succeeded in crossing the Ohio River in safety, and arrived in\r\nCincinnati the third night after our departure. Here we procured\r\nassistance; and, after stopping a short time to rest, we started for\r\nRichmond, Indiana. This is a town which had been settled by Quakers,\r\nand there we found friends indeed, who at once helped us on our way,\r\nwithout loss of time; and after a difficult journey of two weeks\r\nthrough the wilderness, reached Toledo, Ohio, ... and there we took\r\npassage for Canada.\"[526] In the autumn of the year following this\r\nabduction Mr. Henson again visited Kentucky. This time several of\r\nthe Lightfoots were willing to go North with him, and a Saturday\r\nnight after dark was chosen as the time for setting out. In spite\r\nof some untoward happenings during the early part of the journey,\r\nand of pursuit even to Lake Erie, the daring guide and his party\r\nof four or five were put aboard a sailing-vessel and safely landed\r\non Canadian soil. \"Words cannot describe,\" writes Mr. Henson, \"the\r\nfeelings experienced by my companions as they neared the shore;\r\ntheir bosoms were swelling with inexpressible joy as they mounted\r\nthe seats of the boat, ready eagerly to spring forward, that they\r\nmight touch the soil of the freeman. And when they reached the shore\r\nthey danced and wept for joy, and kissed the earth on which they\r\nfirst stepped, no longer the _Slave_, but the _Free_.\" Mr. Henson\r\nasserts, that \"by similar means to those above narrated,\" he was\r\n\"instrumental in delivering one hundred and eighteen human beings\"\r\nfrom bondage.[527]\r\n\r\n  [525] _Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_, chaps. xvi, xvii.\r\n\r\n  [526] _Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_, pp. 149, 150.\r\n\r\n  [527] _Ibid._, pp. 162, 163.\r\n\r\nImportant and interesting among the abductors are the few\r\nindividuals that we must call, for want of a better designation, the\r\ndevotees of abduction. We have already considered a person of this\r\ntype in the odd character, John Fairfield, the Virginian. There are\r\nseveral other persons known to have been not less zealous than he\r\nin their violation of what were held in the South to be legitimate\r\nproperty rights. The names of these adventurous liberators are Rial\r\nCheadle, Alexander M. Ross, Elijah Anderson, John Mason and Harriet\r\nTubman.\r\n\r\nRial Cheadle appears to have been a familiar figure among the\r\nabolitionists of southeastern Ohio. Mr. Thomas L. Gray, a reputable\r\ncitizen of Deavertown, Ohio, for many years engaged in underground\r\noperations in Morgan County, vouches for the extended and aggressive\r\nwork of Cheadle, who frequently stopped at Mr. Gray's house for\r\nrest and refreshment on his midnight trips to Zanesville and\r\nstations farther on.[528] Cheadle seems to have been a man of\r\neccentricities, if not of actual aberration of mind; or his oddities\r\nmay have been assumed to prevent himself being taken seriously by\r\nthose he wanted to despoil. He is said to have lived in Windsor\r\nTownship, Morgan County, Ohio, on the site of the present village\r\nof Stockport, and to have engaged in teaching and other occupations\r\nfor a time; finally, however, he devoted himself to the work of\r\nthe Underground Road. He indulged himself in old-time minstrelsy,\r\ncomposing songs, which he sang for the entertainment of himself\r\nand others, and he thereby increased, doubtless, the reputation\r\nfor harmless imbecility, which he seems to have borne among those\r\nignorant of his purpose. He paid occasional visits to Virginia. \"As\r\na result it is said the slaves were frequently missing, but as his\r\narrangements were carefully made the object of his visit was usually\r\nsuccessful.... His habits were so well known to those who gave food\r\nand shelter to the negro that they were seldom unprepared for a\r\nnocturnal visit from him.... After the Emancipation, he said he was\r\nlike Simeon of old, 'ready to depart.' He died in 1867.\"[529]\r\n\r\n  [528] The _New Lexington_ (Ohio) _Tribune_, winter of 1885-1886.\r\n  Some information in regard to Cheadle appears in a series of\r\n  articles on the Underground Railroad contributed to this paper by\r\n  Mr. Gray.\r\n\r\n  [529] _History of Morgan County, Ohio_, 1886, published by\r\n  Charles Robertson, M.D., article on the Underground Railroad.\r\n\r\nA man differing greatly from Rial Cheadle in all respects, save\r\nthe intensity of his compassion for the slave, was the abductor\r\nAlexander M. Ross. Born in 1832 in the Province of Ontario, Canada,\r\nMr. Ross sought, when a young man, to inform himself upon the\r\nquestion of American slavery, not only from the teachings of some\r\nof the foremost anti-slavery leaders of England and the United\r\nStates, but also from the recital of their experiences by a number\r\nof fugitive slaves that had found an asylum in the province of his\r\nbirth. While he was engaged in making inquiries among the refugees,\r\n_Uncle Tom's Cabin_ was published, and brought conviction to many\r\nminds. \"To me,\" writes Mr. Ross, \"it was a command. A deep and\r\nsettled conviction impressed me that it was my duty to help the\r\noppressed to freedom.... My resolution was taken to devote all\r\nmy energies to let the oppressed go free.\"[530] In accordance\r\nwith this resolution young Ross left Canada in November, 1856. He\r\nvisited Gerrit Smith, at Peterboro, New York, who was ever ready\r\nto encourage the liberation of the slave, and who went with him to\r\nBoston, New York and Philadelphia, and westward into the states of\r\nOhio and Indiana. The purpose of these travels was, evidently, to\r\nacquaint the intending liberator with the means to be employed by\r\nhim in his new work, and with the persons in connection with whom\r\nhe was to operate. Indeed, Mr. Ross distinctly says, in speaking\r\nof these visits, \"I was initiated into a knowledge of the relief\r\nsocieties, and the methods adopted to circulate information among\r\nthe slaves of the South; the routes to be taken by the slaves, after\r\nreaching the so-called free states; and the relief posts, where\r\nshelter and aid for transportation could be obtained.\"[531] His\r\nchief supporters, besides Gerrit Smith, were Theodore Parker and\r\nLewis Tappan.[532]\r\n\r\n  [530] Dr. Alexander Milton Ross, _Recollections and Experiences\r\n  of an Abolitionist; from 1855 to 1865_, 2d ed., 1876, p. 3. The\r\n  first edition of this book was issued in 1867. For this and other\r\n  works of Mr. Ross see _Prominent Men of Canada_, pp. 118, 119,\r\n  120.\r\n\r\n  [531] Ross, _Recollections and Experiences of an Abolitionist_,\r\n  p. 5.\r\n\r\n  [532] _Ibid._, p. 8.\r\n\r\nDuring his expeditions Mr. Ross spread the knowledge of Canada among\r\nthe slaves in the neighborhood of a number of Southern cities,\r\nsuch as Richmond, Virginia, Nashville, Tennessee, Columbus and\r\nVicksburg, Mississippi, Selma and Huntsville, Alabama, Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. His method of procedure\r\nwas fixed in its details only after his arrival upon the scene of\r\naction; an ostensible interest or purpose was kept to the fore, and\r\nthe real business of spreading the gospel of escape was reserved\r\nfor clandestine conferences with slaves chosen on the score of\r\nintelligence and trustworthiness. These persons were informed how\r\nCanada could be best reached, and were told to spread with care\r\nthe information among their fellows. If any decided within a few\r\ndays that they would act upon the advice given them, explicit\r\ninstructions were repeated to them, and they were supplied\r\nwith compasses, knives, pistols, money and such provisions as\r\nthey needed. Thus equipped, they were started on their long\r\nand dangerous journey. Occasionally, when circumstances seemed\r\nto require it, Mr. Ross would personally guide the party to a\r\nstation of the Underground Road, or even accompany it to Canada;\r\notherwise he betook himself in haste to some new field of labor.\r\nThe unimpeachable character of Mr. Ross, and the early appearance\r\nof the first edition of his _Recollections_ make his reminiscences\r\nespecially valuable and worth quoting. Mr. Ross began his work\r\nat Richmond early in the year 1857. His narrative of his first\r\nventure is as follows: \"On my arrival in Richmond, I went to the\r\nhouse of a gentleman to whom I had been directed, and who was known\r\nat the North to be a friend of freedom. I spent a few weeks in\r\nquietly determining upon the best plans to adopt. Having finally\r\ndecided upon my course, I invited a number of the most intelligent,\r\nactive and reliable slaves to meet me at the house of a colored\r\npreacher, on a Sunday evening. On the night appointed for this\r\nmeeting, forty-two slaves came to hear what prospect there was\r\nfor an escape from bondage.... I explained to them my ... purpose\r\nin visiting the slave states, the various routes from Virginia to\r\nOhio and Pennsylvania, and the names of friends in border towns who\r\nwould help them on to Canada. I requested them to circulate this\r\ninformation discreetly among all upon whom they could rely.... I\r\nrequested as many as were ready to accept my offer, to come to the\r\nsame house on the following Sunday evening, prepared to take the\r\n'Underground Railroad' to Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. ALEXANDER M. ROSS,\r\n\r\nAN ABDUCTOR OF SLAVES.\r\n\r\n(His distinguished services as a naturalist are attested by his\r\nmedals, bestowed by European princes.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRIET TUBMAN,\r\n\r\n\"THE MOSES OF HER PEOPLE.\"\r\n\r\nHerself a fugitive, she abducted more than 300 slaves, and also\r\nserved as a scout and nurse for the Union forces.]\r\n\r\n\"On the evening appointed nine stout, intelligent young men declared\r\ntheir determination to gain their freedom, or die in the attempt.\r\nTo each I gave a few dollars in money, a pocket compass, knife,\r\npistol, and as much cold meat and bread as each could carry with\r\nease. I again explained to them the route.... I never met more apt\r\nstudents than these poor fellows.... They were to travel only by\r\nnight, resting in some secure spot during the day. Their route was\r\nto be through Pennsylvania, to Erie on Lake Erie, and from thence to\r\nCanada.... I learned, many months after, that they all had arrived\r\nsafely in Canada. (In 1863 I enlisted three of these brave fellows\r\nin a colored regiment in Philadelphia, for service in the war that\r\ngave freedom to their race.)\"[533]\r\n\r\n  [533] Ross, _Recollections and Experiences of an Abolitionist_,\r\n  pp. 10, 11, 12.\r\n\r\nMr. Ross was a naturalist, and his tastes in this direction\r\nfurnished him many good pretexts for excursions. A journey into the\r\nfar South was made in the guise of an ornithologist. Describing his\r\ntrip to the cotton states Mr. Ross says: \"Finally my preparations\r\nwere completed, and, supplied with a shot-gun and materials for\r\npreserving bird-skins, I began my journey into the interior of the\r\ncountry.... Soon after my arrival at Vicksburg I was busily engaged\r\nin collecting ornithological specimens. I made frequent visits to\r\nthe surrounding plantations, seizing every favorable opportunity to\r\nconverse with the more intelligent slaves. Many of these negroes\r\nhad heard of Canada from the negroes brought from Virginia and the\r\nborder slave states; but the impression they had was, that Canada\r\nbeing so far away, it would be useless to try and reach it. On\r\nthese excursions I was usually accompanied by one or two smart,\r\nintelligent slaves, to whom I felt I could trust the secret of my\r\nvisit. In this way I succeeded in circulating a knowledge of Canada,\r\nand the best means of reaching that country, to all the plantations\r\nfor many miles around Vicksburg.... I continued my labors in the\r\nvicinity of Vicksburg for several weeks and then went to Selma,\r\nAlabama.\"[534]\r\n\r\n  [534] _Ibid._, pp. 37, 38, 39.\r\n\r\n\"In the ways described in these selections Mr. Ross induced\r\ncompanies of slaves to exchange bondage for freedom. How many he\r\nthus liberated we have, of course, no means of knowing. The risks\r\nhe ran were such as to put his life in danger almost constantly.\r\nBetrayal would have ended, probably, in a lynching; and the\r\ndisappearance simultaneously of a band of fugitives and the unknown\r\nnaturalist was a coincidence not only sure to be noticed, but also\r\nwidely published, thus increasing the dangers many fold. It is\r\nunnecessary to recount the occasions upon which the scientist found\r\nhimself in danger of falling a victim to his zeal in befriending\r\nslaves. Suffice it to say, his adventures all had a fortunate\r\ntermination. Mr. Ross is best known by his numerous works relating\r\nto the flora and fauna of Canada, for which he received recognition\r\namong learned men, and decoration at the hands of European\r\nprinces.\"[535]\r\n\r\n  [535] Mr. Richard J. Hinton in his book entitled _John Brown and\r\n  His Men_, p. 171, while writing of Captain Brown's convention\r\n  at Chatham, Canada West, mentions Mr. Ross in the following\r\n  words: \"Dr. Alexander M. Ross of Toronto, Canada, physician and\r\n  ornithologist, who is still living, honored by all who know\r\n  him, then a young (white) man who devoted himself for years to\r\n  aiding the American slave, was a frequent visitor to this section\r\n  (Chatham). He was a faithful friend of John Brown, efficient as\r\n  an ally, seeking to serve under all conditions of need and peril.\"\r\n\r\n  More or less extended notices of Dr. Ross and his work have\r\n  appeared during the past few years; for example, in the _Toronto\r\n  Globe_, Dec. 3 and 10, 1892; in the _Canadian Magazine of\r\n  Politics, Science, Art and Literature_, May, 1896; and in the\r\n  _Chicago Daily Inter-Ocean_, March 18, 1896.\r\n\r\nElijah Anderson, a negro, has been described by Mr. Rush R. Sloane,\r\nan underground veteran of northwestern Ohio, as the \"general\r\nsuperintendent\" of the underground system in this section of Ohio.\r\nMr. Anderson's work began before the enactment of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw of 1850, and continued until the time of his incarceration in\r\nthe state prison at Frankfort, Kentucky, where he died in 1857.\r\nDuring this period his activity must have been unceasing, for he\r\nis quoted as having said in 1855 that he had conducted in all more\r\nthan a thousand fugitives from slavery to freedom, having brought\r\neight hundred away after the passage of the act of 1850. Not all of\r\nthese persons were piloted to Sandusky, although that city was the\r\npoint to which Anderson usually conveyed his passengers. After the\r\nopening of the Cleveland and Cincinnati Railroad he took many to\r\nCleveland.[536]\r\n\r\n  [536] The _Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, p. 44.\r\n\r\nThe last two of the devotees of abduction to be considered in this\r\nchapter are persons that were themselves fugitive slaves, John Mason\r\nand Harriet Tubman.\r\n\r\nOur only source of information about John Mason is an account\r\nprinted in 1860, by the Rev. W. M. Mitchell, a colored missionary\r\nsent to minister to the refugees of Toronto by the American Baptist\r\nFree Mission Society.[537] This may be accepted as a credible source.\r\nThe author has printed in the little book in which the account\r\nappears testimonials that serve to identify him, but better\r\nthan these are the references found in the body of the book to\r\nunderground matters pertaining to southern Ohio that have been made\r\nfamiliar through other channels of information. The statements\r\nof Mr. Mitchell, thus supported, lend the color of probability\r\nto other statements of his not corroborated by any information\r\nnow to be obtained, especially since these are in keeping with\r\nknown manifestations of liberating zeal. We may therefore use the\r\nnarrative relating to John Mason with a certain degree of assurance\r\nas to its accuracy.\r\n\r\n  [537] See p. 3, Chapter I.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in Underground Railroad operations in Ohio Mr.\r\nMitchell became acquainted with John Mason, a fugitive slave from\r\nKentucky. He had obtained his liberty but was not content to\r\nsee his fellows go without theirs, and \"was willing,\" wrote Mr.\r\nMitchell, \"to risk the forfeiture of his own freedom, that he might,\r\nperadventure, secure the liberty of some. He commenced the perilous\r\nbusiness of going into the State from whence he had escaped and\r\nespecially into his old neighborhood, decoying off his brethren\r\nto Canada.... This slave brought to my house in nineteen months\r\n265 human beings whom he had been instrumental in redeeming from\r\nslavery; all of whom I had the privilege of forwarding to Canada by\r\nthe Underground Railroad.... He kept no record as to the number he\r\nhad assisted in this way. I have only been able, from conversations\r\nwith him on the subject, to ascertain about 1,300, whom he delivered\r\nto abolitionists to be forwarded to Canada. Poor man! he was finally\r\ncaptured and sold. He had been towards the interior of Kentucky,\r\nabout fifty miles; it was while returning with four slaves that he\r\nwas captured.... Daylight came on them, they concealed themselves\r\nunder stacks of corn, which served them for food, as well as\r\nprotection from the weather and passers-by.... Late in the afternoon\r\nof that day, in the distance was heard the baying of negro-hounds\r\non their track; escape was impossible.... When the four slaves saw\r\ntheir masters they said, 'J. M., we can't fight.' He endeavored\r\nto rally their courage ... but to no purpose.... Their leader\r\nresisted, but both his arms were broken, and his body otherwise\r\nabused.... Though he had changed his name, as most slaves do on\r\nrunning away, he told his master's name and to him he was delivered.\r\nHe was eventually sold and was taken to New Orleans.... Yet in one\r\nyear, five months, and twenty days, I received a letter from this\r\nman, John Mason, from Hamilton, Canada West. Let a man walk abroad\r\non Freedom's Sunny Plains, and having once drunk of its celestial\r\n'stream whereof maketh glad the city of our God,' afterward reduce\r\nthis man to slavery, it is next to an impossibility to retain him in\r\nslavery.\"[538]\r\n\r\n  [538] Mitchell, _The Underground Railroad_, p. 20 _et seq._\r\n\r\nHarriet Tubman, like John Mason, did not reckon the value of her own\r\nliberty in comparison with the liberty of others who had not tasted\r\nits sweets. Like him, she saw in the oppression of her race the\r\nsufferings of the enslaved Israelites, and was not slow to demand\r\nthat the Pharaoh of the South should let her people go. She was\r\nknown to many of the anti-slavery leaders of her generation; her\r\npersonality and her power were such that none of them ever forgot\r\nthe high virtues of this simple black woman. Governor William H.\r\nSeward, of New York, wrote of her: \"I have known Harriet long,\r\nand a nobler, higher spirit or a truer, seldom dwells in human\r\nform.\"[539] Gerrit Smith declared: \"I am convinced that she is not\r\nonly truthful, but that she has a rare discernment, and a deep and\r\nsublime philanthropy.\"[540] John Brown introduced her to Wendell\r\nPhillips in Boston, saying, \"I bring you one of the best and bravest\r\npersons on this continent--General Tubman as we call her.\"[541]\r\nFrederick Douglass testified: \"Excepting John Brown, of sacred\r\nmemory, I know of no one who has willingly encountered more perils\r\nand hardships to serve our enslaved people than you have. Much that\r\nyou have done would seem improbable to those who do not know you as\r\nI know you....\"[542] Mr. F. B. Sanborn said: \"She has often been in\r\nConcord, where she resided at the houses of Emerson, Alcott, the\r\nWhitneys, the Brooks family, Mrs. Horace Mann, and other well-known\r\npersons. They all admired and respected her, and nobody doubted the\r\nreality of her adventures....\"[543] The Rev. S. J. May knew Harriet\r\npersonally, and speaks with admiration, not only of the work she did\r\nin emancipating numbers of her own people, but also of the important\r\nservices she rendered the nation during the Civil War both as a\r\nnurse and as \"the leader of soldiers in scouting-parties and raids.\r\nShe seemed to know no fear and scarcely ever fatigue. They called\r\nher their Moses.\"[544]\r\n\r\n  [539] Sarah H. Bradford, _Harriet the Moses of Her People_, p.\r\n  76. See also Appendix, p. 137. These testimonials were given\r\n  in 1868 and were printed in connection with a short biography\r\n  of Harriet in the year mentioned. The first edition of this\r\n  biography has not been accessible to me, but it is mentioned by\r\n  the Rev. Samuel J. May in his _Recollections of the Anti-Slavery\r\n  Conflict_, published the following year. The second edition of\r\n  the book appeared in 1886.\r\n\r\n  [540] _Ibid._, p. 139.\r\n\r\n  [541] Hinton, _John Brown and His Men_, p. 173.\r\n\r\n  [542] Mrs. Bradford, _Harriet the Moses of Her People_, p. 135.\r\n\r\n  [543] _Ibid._, pp. 136, 137.\r\n\r\n  [544] _Ibid._, p. 406.\r\n\r\nThe name, Moses, was that by which this woman was commonly known.\r\nShe earned it by the qualities of leadership displayed in conducting\r\nbands of slaves through devious ways and manifold perils out of\r\ntheir \"land of Egypt.\" She first learned what liberty was for\r\nherself about the year 1849. She made her way from Maryland, her\r\nhome as a slave, to Philadelphia, and there by industry gathered\r\ntogether a sum of money with which to begin her humane and\r\nself-imposed labors. In December, 1850, she went to Baltimore and\r\nabducted her sister and two children. A few months later she brought\r\naway another company of three persons, one of whom was her brother.\r\nFrom this time on till the outbreak of the War of the Rebellion her\r\nexcursions were frequent. She is said to have accomplished nineteen\r\nsuch trips, and emancipated over three hundred slaves.[545] As may\r\nbe surmised, she had encouragement in her undertakings; but her main\r\ndependence was upon her own efforts. All her wages were laid aside\r\nfor the purpose of emancipating her people. Whenever she had secured\r\na sufficient sum, she would disappear from her Northern home, work\r\nher passage South, and meet the band of expectant slaves, whom she\r\nhad forewarned of her coming in some mysterious way.\r\n\r\n  [545] James Freeman Clarke, _Anti-Slavery Days_, pp. 81, 82. Also\r\n  M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 62.\r\n\r\nHer sagacity was one of her most marked traits; it was displayed\r\nconstantly in her management of her little caravans. Thus she would\r\ntake the precaution to start with her pilgrims on Saturday night\r\nso that they could be well along on their journey before they were\r\nadvertised. Posters giving descriptions of the runaways and offering\r\na considerable reward for their arrest were a common means of making\r\npublic the loss of slave property. Harriet often paid a negro to\r\nfollow the man who posted the descriptions of her companions and\r\ntear them down. When there were babies in the party she sometimes\r\ndrugged them with paregoric and had them carried in baskets. She\r\nknew where friends could be found that would give shelter to her\r\nweary freedmen. If at any stage of the journey she were compelled\r\nto leave her companions and forage for supplies she would disclose\r\nherself on her return through the strains of a favorite song:--\r\n\r\n    Dark and thorny is de pathway,\r\n      Where de pilgrim makes his ways;\r\n    But beyond dis vale of sorrow,\r\n      Lie de fields of endless days.\r\n\r\nSometimes when hard pressed by pursuers she would take a train\r\nsouthward with her companions; she knew that no one would suspect\r\nfugitives travelling in that direction. Harriet was a well-known\r\nvisitor at the offices of the anti-slavery societies in Philadelphia\r\nand New York, and at first she seems to have been content if her\r\nprotégés arrived safely among friends in either of these cities;\r\nbut after she comprehended the Fugitive Slave Law she preferred\r\nto accompany them all the way to Canada. \"I wouldn't,\" she said,\r\n\"trust Uncle Sam wid my people no longer.\"[546] She knew the\r\nneed of discipline in effecting her rough, overland marches, and\r\nshe therefore required strict obedience of her followers. The\r\ndiscouragement of an individual could not be permitted to endanger\r\nthe liberty, and safety of the whole party; accordingly she\r\nsometimes strengthened the fainting heart by threatening to use her\r\nrevolver, and declaring, \"Dead niggers tell no tales, you go on or\r\ndie.\" She was not less lenient with herself. The safety of her\r\ncompanions was her chief concern; she would not allow her labors to\r\nbe lightened by any course likely to increase the chances of their\r\ndiscovery. On one occasion, while leading a company, she experienced\r\na feeling that danger was near; unhesitatingly she decided to ford a\r\nriver near by, because she must do so to be safe. Her followers were\r\nafraid to cross, but Harriet, despite the severity of the weather\r\n(the month was March), and her ignorance of the depth of the stream,\r\nwalked resolutely into the water and led the way to the opposite\r\nshore. It was found that officers were lying in wait for the party\r\non the route first intended.\r\n\r\n  [546] Mrs. Bradford, _Harriet the Moses of Her People_, p. 39.\r\n\r\nLike many of her race Harriet was a thorough-going mystic. The\r\nQuaker, Thomas Garrett, said of her: \"... I never met with any\r\nperson, of any color, who had more confidence in the voice of God,\r\nas spoken to her soul. She has frequently told me that she talked\r\nwith God, and he talked with her, every day of her life, and she\r\nhas declared to me that she felt no more fear of being arrested\r\nby her former master, or any other person, when in his immediate\r\nneighborhood, than she did in the State of New York, or Canada, for\r\nshe said she never ventured only where God sent her. Her faith in\r\nthe Supreme Power truly was great.\"[547] This faith never deserted\r\nher in her times of peril. She explained her many deliverances as\r\nHarriet Beecher Stowe accounted for the power and effect of _Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin_. She insisted it was all God's doing. \"Jes so long as\r\nhe wanted to use me,\" said Mrs. Tubman, \"he would take keer of me,\r\nan' when he didn't want me no longer, I was ready to go. I always\r\ntole him, I'm gwine to hole stiddy on to you, an' you've got to see\r\nme trou.\"[548]\r\n\r\n  [547] Mrs. Bradford, _Harriet the Moses of Her People_, pp. 83,\r\n  84.\r\n\r\n  [548] _Ibid._, p. 61.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Mrs. Tubman made what has been called her most venturesome\r\njourney. She had brought several of her brothers and sisters from\r\nslavery, but had not hit upon a method to release her aged parents.\r\nThe chief difficulty lay in the fact that they were unable to walk\r\nlong distances. At length she devised a plan and carried it through.\r\nA homemade conveyance was patched together, and an old horse\r\nbrought into use. Mr. Garrett describes the vehicle as consisting of\r\na pair of old chaise-wheels, with a board on the axle to sit on and\r\nanother board swinging by ropes from the axle on which to rest their\r\nfeet. This rude contrivance Harriet used in conveying her parents to\r\nthe railroad, where they were put aboard the cars for Wilmington;\r\nand she followed them in her novel vehicle. At Wilmington, Friend\r\nGarrett was sought out by the bold abductor, and he furnished her\r\nwith money to take all of them to Canada. He afterwards sold their\r\nhorse and sent them the money. Harriet and her family did not long\r\nremain in Canada; Auburn, New York, was deemed a preferable place;\r\nand here a small property was bought on easy terms of Governor\r\nSeward, to provide a home for the enfranchised mother and father.\r\n\r\nBefore Harriet had finished paying for her bit of real estate, the\r\nCivil War broke out. Governor Andrew of Massachusetts, appreciating\r\nthe sagacity, bravery and kindliness of the woman, soon summoned her\r\nto go into the South to serve as a scout, and when necessary as a\r\nhospital nurse. That her services were valuable was the testimony\r\nof officers under whom she served; thus General Rufus Saxton wrote\r\nin March, 1868: \"I can bear witness to the value of her services in\r\nSouth Carolina and Florida. She was employed in the hospitals and as\r\na spy. She made many a raid inside the enemies' lines, displaying\r\nremarkable courage, zeal and fidelity.\"[549]\r\n\r\n  [549] Mrs. Bradford, _Harriet the Moses of Her People_, Appendix,\r\n  p. 142.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the great struggle Harriet returned to Auburn,\r\nwhere she has lived ever since. Her devotion to her people has never\r\nceased. Although she is very poor and is subject to the infirmities\r\nof old age, infirmities increased in her case by the effects of ill\r\ntreatment received in slavery, she has managed to transform her\r\nhouse into a hospital, where she provides and cares for some of the\r\nhelpless and deserving of her own race.[550]\r\n\r\n  [550] Lillie B.

Conversation with Harriet Tubman, Cambridge,\r\n  Mass., April 8, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE COLORED REFUGEES IN CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passengers of the Underground Railroad had but one real refuge,\r\none region alone within whose bounds they could know they were\r\nsafe from reënslavement; that region was Canada. The position of\r\nCanada on the slavery question was peculiar, for the imperial act\r\nabolishing slavery throughout the colonies of England was not\r\npassed until 1833; and, legally, if not actually, slavery existed\r\nin Canada until that year. The importation of slaves into this\r\nnorthern country had been tolerated by the French, and later, under\r\nan act passed in 1790, had been encouraged by the English. It is a\r\nsingular fact that while this measure was in force slaves escaped\r\nfrom their Canadian masters to the United States, where they found\r\nfreedom.[551] Before the separation of the Upper and Lower Provinces\r\nin 1791, slavery had spread westward into Upper Canada, and a few\r\nhundred negroes and some Pawnee Indians were to be found in bondage\r\nthrough the small scattered settlements of the Niagara, Home and\r\nWestern districts.\r\n\r\n  [551] \"A case of this kind,\" says Dr. S. G. Howe, \"was related\r\n  to us by Mrs. Amy Martin. She says: \"My father's name was James\r\n  Ford.... He ... would be over one hundred years old, if he were\r\n  now living.... He was held here (in Canada) by the Indians as a\r\n  slave, and sold, I think he said, to a British officer, who was a\r\n  very cruel master, and he escaped from him, and came to Ohio, ...\r\n  to Cleveland, I believe, first, and made his way from there to\r\n  Erie (Pa.), where he settled.... When we were in Erie, we moved a\r\n  little way out of the village, and our house was ... a station of\r\n  the U. G. R. R.\" _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, by\r\n  S. G. Howe, 1864, pp. 8, 9.\r\n\r\nThe Province of Upper Canada took the initiative in the restriction\r\nof slavery. In the year 1793, in which Congress provided for the\r\nrendition by the Northern states of fugitives from labor, the\r\nfirst parliament of Upper Canada enacted a law against the\r\nimportation of slaves, and incorporated in it a clause to the\r\neffect that children of slaves then held were to become free at\r\nthe age of twenty-five years.[552] Nevertheless, judicial rather\r\nthan legislative action terminated slavery in Lower Canada, for a\r\nseries of three fugitive slave cases occurred between the first\r\nday of February, 1798, and the last day of February, 1800. The\r\nthird of these suits, known as the Robin case, was tried before the\r\nfull Court of King's Bench, and the court ordered the discharge\r\nof the fugitive from his confinement. Perhaps the correctness of\r\nthe decisions rendered in these cases may be questioned; but it is\r\nnoteworthy that the provincial legislature would not cross them, and\r\nit may therefore be asserted that slavery really ceased in Lower\r\nCanada after the decision of the Robin case, February 18, 1800.[553]\r\n\r\n  [552] Act of 30th Geo. III.\r\n\r\n  [553] See the article entitled \"Slavery in Canada,\" by J. C.\r\n  Hamilton, LL.B., in the _Magazine of American History_, Vol. XXV,\r\n  pp. 233-236.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GROUP OF REFUGEE SETTLERS, OF WINDSOR, ONTARIO.\r\n\r\nMRS. ANNE MARY JANE HUNT, MANSFIELD SMITH, MRS. LUCINDA SEYMOUR,\r\nHENRY STEVENSON, BUSH JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n(From a recent photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe seaboard provinces were but little infected by slavery. Nova\r\nScotia, to which probably more than to any other of these, refugees\r\nfrom Southern bondage fled, had by reason of natural causes, lost\r\nnearly, if not quite all traces of slavery by the beginning of\r\nour century. The experience of the eighteenth century had been\r\nsufficient to reform public opinion in Canada on the question\r\nof slavery, and to show that the climate of the provinces was a\r\npermanent barrier to the profitable employment of slave labor.\r\n\r\nDuring the period in which Canada was thus freeing herself from the\r\nlast vestiges of the evil, slaves who had escaped from Southern\r\nmasters were beginning to appeal for protection to anti-slavery\r\npeople in the Northern states.[554] The arrests of refugees from\r\nbondage, and the cases of kidnapping of free negroes, which were\r\nnot infrequent in the North, strengthened the appeals of the hunted\r\nsuppliants. Under these circumstances, it was natural that there\r\nshould have arisen early in the present century the beginnings of a\r\nmovement on the northern border of the United States for the purpose\r\nof helping fugitives to Canadian soil.[555]\r\n\r\n  [554] M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 20.\r\n\r\n  [555] _Ibid._, p. 60; R. C. Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, p.\r\n  26.\r\n\r\nUpon the questions how and when this system arose, we have both\r\nunofficial and official testimony. Dr. Samuel G. Howe learned upon\r\ncareful investigation, in 1863, that the early abolition of slavery\r\nin Canada did not affect slavery in the United States for several\r\nyears. \"Now and then a slave was intelligent and bold enough,\" he\r\nstates, \"to cross the vast forest between the Ohio and the Lakes,\r\nand find a refuge beyond them. Such cases were at first very rare,\r\nand knowledge of them was confined to few; but they increased early\r\nin this century; and the rumor gradually spread among the slaves\r\nof the Southern states, that there was, far away under the north\r\nstar, a land where the flag of the Union did not float; where the\r\nlaw declared all men free and equal; where the people respected\r\nthe law, and the government, if need be, enforced it.... Some, not\r\ncontent with personal freedom and happiness, went secretly back to\r\ntheir old homes, and brought away their wives and children at much\r\nperil and cost. The rumor widened; the fugitives so increased, that\r\na secret pathway, since called the Underground Railroad, was soon\r\nformed, which ran by the huts of the blacks in the slave states,\r\nand the houses of good Samaritans in the free states.... Hundreds\r\ntrod this path every year, but they did not attract much public\r\nnotice.\"[556] Before the year 1817 it is said that a single little\r\ngroup of abolitionists in southern Ohio had forwarded to Canada by\r\nthis secret path more than a thousand fugitive slaves.[557] The\r\ntruth of this account is confirmed by the diplomatic negotiations\r\nof 1826 relating to this subject. Mr. Clay, then Secretary of\r\nState, declared the escape of slaves to British territory to be\r\na \"growing evil\"; and in 1828 he again described it as still\r\n\"growing,\" and added that it was well calculated to disturb the\r\npeaceful relations existing between the United States and the\r\nadjacent British provinces. England, however, steadfastly refused\r\nto accept Mr. Clay's proposed stipulation for extradition, on the\r\nground that the British government could not, \"with respect to the\r\nBritish possessions where slavery is not admitted, depart from the\r\nprinciple recognized by the British courts that every man is free\r\nwho reaches British ground.\"[558]\r\n\r\n  [556] S. G. Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp.\r\n  11, 12.\r\n\r\n  [557] William Birney, _James G. Birney and His Times_, p. 435.\r\n\r\n  [558] Mr. Gallatin to Mr. Clay, Sept. 26, 1827, _Niles'\r\n  Register_, p. 290.\r\n\r\nDuring the decade between 1828 and 1838 many persons throughout the\r\nNorthern states, as far west as Iowa, had coöperated in forming\r\nnew lines of Underground Railroad with termini at various points\r\nalong the Canadian frontier. A resolution submitted to Congress in\r\nDecember, 1838, was aimed at these persons, by calling for a bill\r\nproviding for the punishment, in the courts of the United States,\r\nof all persons guilty of aiding fugitive slaves to escape, or of\r\nenticing them from their owners.[559] Though this resolution came to\r\nnought, the need of it may have been demonstrated to the minds of\r\nSouthern men by the fact that several companies of runaway slaves\r\nwere organized, and took part in the Patriot War of this year in\r\ndefence of Canadian territory against the attack of two or three\r\nhundred armed men from the State of New York.[560]\r\n\r\n  [559] _Congressional Globe_, Twenty-fifth Congress, Third\r\n  Session, p. 34.\r\n\r\n  [560] The Patriot War defeated a foolhardy attempt to induce\r\n  the Province of Upper Canada to proclaim its independence. The\r\n  refugees were by no means willing to see a movement begun, the\r\n  success of which might \"break the only arm interposed for their\r\n  security.\" _J. W. Loguen as a Slave and as a Freeman_, p. 344.\r\n\r\nEach succeeding year witnessed the influx into Canada of a larger\r\nnumber of colored emigrants from the South. At length, in 1850,\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law called forth such opposition in the North\r\nthat the Underground Railroad became more efficient than ever. The\r\nsecretary of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society wrote in 1851\r\nthat, \"notwithstanding the stringent provisions of the Fugitive\r\nBill, and the confidence which was felt in it as a certain cure\r\nfor escape, we are happy to know that the evasion of slaves was\r\nnever greater than at this moment. All abolitionists, at any of\r\nthe prominent points of the country, know that applications for\r\nassistance were never more frequent.\"[561] This statement is\r\nsubstantiated by the testimony of many persons who did underground\r\nservice in the North.\r\n\r\n  [561] _Nineteenth Annual Report of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery\r\n  Society_, January, 1851, p. 67.\r\n\r\nFrom the other end of the line, the Canadian terminus, we have\r\nabundant evidence of the lively traffic both before and after the\r\nnew act. Besides the later investigations of Dr. Howe we have the\r\nstatement of a contemporary, still living. Anthony Bingey, of\r\nWindsor, Ontario, aided the Rev. Hiram Wilson and the Rev. Isaac\r\nJ. Rice, two graduates of Hamilton College, in the conduct of a\r\nmission for refugees. Mr. Bingey first settled at Amherstburg, at\r\nthe mouth of the Detroit River, where he kept a receiving station\r\nfor fugitives, was in an excellent place for observation, and was\r\nallied with trained men, who gave themselves, in the missionary\r\nspirit, to the cause of the fugitive slave in Canada. When Mr.\r\nBingey first went to Amherstburg, in 1845, it was a rare occurrence\r\nto see as many as fifteen fugitives arrive in a single company. In\r\nthe course of time runaways began to disembark from the ferries and\r\nlake boats in larger numbers, a day's tale often running as high\r\nas thirty. Through the period of the Mexican War, and down to the\r\nbeginning of Fillmore's administration, many of the fugitives from\r\nthe South had settled in the States, but after 1850 many, fearing\r\nrecapture, journeyed in haste to Canada, greatly increasing the\r\nnumber daily arriving there.[562] That there was no tendency towards\r\na decline in the movement is suggested by two items appearing in the\r\n_Independent_ during the year 1855. According to the first of these\r\n(quoted from the _Intelligencer_ of St. Louis, Missouri): \"The evil\r\n(of running off slaves) has got to be an immense one, and is daily\r\nbecoming more aggravated. It threatens to subvert the institution\r\nof slavery in this state entirely, and unless effectually checked\r\nit will certainly do so. There is no doubt that ten slaves are now\r\nstolen from Missouri to every one that was 'spirited' off before the\r\nDouglas bill.\"[563] It is significant that the ardent abolitionists\r\nof Iowa and northwestern Illinois were vigorously engaged in\r\nUnderground Railroad work at this time. The other item declared\r\nthat the number of fugitives transported by the \"Ohio Underground\r\nLine\" was twenty-five per cent greater than in any previous year;\r\n\"indeed, many masters have brought their hands from the Kanawha\r\n(West Virginia), not being willing to risk them there.\"[564]\r\n\r\n  [562] Interview with Elder Anthony Bingey, Windsor, Ontario, July\r\n  31, 1895. On this point Dr. S. G. Howe says: \"Of course it [the\r\n  Fugitive Slave Law] gave great increase to the emigration,\r\n  and free born blacks fled with the slaves from a land in which\r\n  their birthright of freedom was no longer secure.\" _Refugees from\r\n  Slavery in Canada West_, p. 15.\r\n\r\n  [563] _Independent_, Jan. 18, 1855.\r\n\r\n  [564] _Independent_, April 6, 1855; see also _Von Holst's\r\n  Constitutional and Political History of the United States_, Vol.\r\n  V, p. 63, note.\r\n\r\nThat portion of Canada most easily reached by fugitives was the\r\nlake-bound region lying between New York on the east and Michigan\r\non the west, and presenting a long and inviting coast-line to\r\nnorthern Ohio, northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York. Lower\r\nCanada was often reached through the New England states and by\r\nway of the coast-line routes. The fugitive slaves entering Canada\r\nwere principally from the border slave states, Missouri, Kentucky,\r\nVirginia, Maryland and Delaware. Some, however, favored by rare good\r\nfortune and possessed of more than ordinary sagacity or aided by\r\nsome venturesome friend, had made their way from the far South, from\r\nthe Carolinas, Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee, even from Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives who reached Canada do not seem to have been notable;\r\non the whole they were a representative body of the slave-class. An\r\nobserver on a Southern plantation could hardly have selected out\r\nwould-be fugitives, as being superior to their fellows. If he had\r\nquestioned them all about their desire for liberty he would have\r\nfound habitual runaways agreeing with their fellows that they were\r\ncontent with their present lot. The average slave was shrewd enough\r\nunder ordinary circumstances to tell what he thought least likely\r\nto arouse suspicion. That such discretion did not signify lack of\r\ndesire for freedom is shown not only by the numerous escapes, but\r\nby the narratives of fugitives. Said Leonard Harrod: \"Many a time\r\nmy master has told me things to try me; among others he said he\r\nthought of moving up to Cincinnati, and asked me if I did not want\r\nto go. I would tell him, 'No! I don't want to go to none of your\r\nfree countries!' Then he'd laugh, but I did want to come--surely\r\nI did. A colored man tells the truth here,--there he is afraid\r\nto.\"[565] \"I have known slaves to be hungry,\" said David West, \"but\r\nwhen their master asked them if they had enough, they would through\r\nfear say, 'Yes.' So if asked if they wish to be free, they will say\r\n'No.' I knew a case where there was a division of between fifty\r\nand sixty slaves among heirs, one of whom intended to set free her\r\npart. So wishing to consult them she asked of such and such ones\r\nif they would like to be free, and they all said 'No,' for if they\r\nhad said yes, and had then fallen to the other heirs, they would be\r\nsold,--and so they said, 'No,' against their own consciences.\"[566]\r\n\"From the time I was a little boy it always ground my feelings to\r\nknow that I had to work for another man,\" said Edward Walker, of\r\nWindsor, Ontario.[567] When asked to help hunt two slave-women,\r\nHenry Stevenson, a slave in Odrain County, Missouri, at first\r\ndeclined, knowing that his efforts to find them would bring upon\r\nhim the wrath of the other slaves. \"I wouldn't go,\" he related;\r\n\"the colored folks would 'a' killed me.\" In his refusal he was\r\nsupported by a white man, who had the wisdom to observe that \"'Twas\r\na bad policy to send a nigger to hunt a nigger.\" Nevertheless,\r\nStevenson's trustworthiness had been so often tested that he was\r\ntaken along to help prosecute the search, and even accompanied the\r\nparty of pursuers to Chicago, where he disappeared by the aid of\r\nabolitionists and was afterward heard of in Windsor, Ontario.[568]\r\nElder Anthony Bingey, of the same place, said, \"I never saw the day\r\nsince I knew anything that I didn't want to be free. Both Bucknel\r\nand Taylor [his successive masters] liked to see their slaves happy\r\nand well treated, but I always wanted to be free.\"[569]\r\n\r\n  [565] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, 1856, p. 340.\r\n\r\n  [566] _Ibid._, p. 91.\r\n\r\n  [567] _Detroit Sunday News Tribune_, quoted by the _Louisville\r\n  Journal_, Aug. 12, 1894.\r\n\r\n  [568] Conversation with Henry Stevenson, Windsor, Ont., July,\r\n  1895.\r\n\r\n  [569] Conversation with Elder Anthony Bingey, Windsor, Ont., July\r\n  31, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe manifestations of delight by fugitives when landed on the\r\nCanada shore is another part of the evidence of the sincerity of\r\ntheir aspirations for freedom. Captain Chapman, the commander of a\r\nvessel on Lake Erie in 1860, was requested by two acquaintances at\r\nCleveland to put ashore on the Canada side two persons, who were,\r\nof course, fugitives, and he gives the following account of the\r\nlanding: \"While they were on my vessel I felt little interest in\r\nthem, and had no idea that the love of liberty as a part of man's\r\nnature was in the least possible degree felt or understood by them.\r\nBefore entering Buffalo harbor, I ran in near the Canada shore,\r\nmanned a boat, and landed them on the beach.... They said, 'Is\r\nthis Canada?' I said, 'Yes, there are no slaves in this country';\r\nthen I witnessed a scene I shall never forget. They seemed to be\r\ntransformed; a new light shone in their eyes, their tongues were\r\nloosed, they laughed and cried, prayed and sang praises, fell upon\r\nthe ground and kissed it, hugged and kissed each other, crying,\r\n'Bress de Lord! Oh! I'se free before I die!'\"[570]\r\n\r\n  [570] E. M. Pettit, _Sketches in the History of the Underground\r\n  Railroad_, pp. 66, 67. See also Chapter I, p. 14, and Chapter VI,\r\n  p. 178.\r\n\r\nThe state of ignorance in which the slave population of the South\r\nwas largely kept must be regarded as the admission by the master\r\nclass that their slaves were likely to seize the boon of freedom,\r\nunless denied the encouragement towards self-emancipation that\r\nknowledge would surely afford. The fables about Canada brought to\r\nthe North by runaways well illustrate both the ignorance of the\r\nslave and the apprehensions of his owner. William Johnson, who fled\r\nfrom Hopkins County, Virginia, had been told that the Detroit River\r\nwas over three thousand miles wide, and a ship starting out in the\r\nnight would find herself in the morning \"right whar she started\r\nfrom.\" In the light of his later experience Johnson says, \"We knowed\r\njess what dey tole us and no more.\"[571] Deacon Allen Sidney,\r\nan engineer on his master's boat, which touched at Cincinnati,\r\nhad a poor opinion of Canada because he had heard that \"nothin'\r\nbut black-eyed peas could be raised there.\"[572] John Evans, who\r\ntravelled through the Northern country, and even in Canada, with\r\nhis Kentucky master, was insured against the temptation to seize\r\nhis liberty by the warning to let no \"British nigger\" get near him\r\nlest he should be slain \"jess like on de battle-field.\"[573] John\r\nReed heard the white people in Memphis, Tennessee, talk much of\r\nCanada, but he adds \"they'd put some extract onto it to keep us from\r\ncomin'.\"[574]\r\n\r\n  [571] Conversation with William Johnson, at Windsor, Ont., July\r\n  31, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [572] Conversation with Allen Sidney, Windsor, Ont.\r\n\r\n  [573] Conversation with John Evans, Windsor, Ont., Aug. 2, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [574] Conversation with John Reed, Windsor, Ont.\r\n\r\nAlthough many disparaging things said about Canada at the South were\r\nwithout the shadow of verity, there were still hardships enough to\r\nbe met by those who settled there. The provinces constituted for\r\nthem a strange country. Its climate, raw, open and variable, and\r\nat certain periods of the year severe, increased the sufferings of\r\na people already destitute. The condition in which many of them\r\narrived beyond the borders, especially those who migrated before\r\nthe forties, is vividly told by J. W. Loguen in his account of his\r\nfirst arrival at Hamilton, Canada West, in 1835. Writing to his\r\nfriend, Frederick Douglass, under date of May 8, 1856, he says:\r\n\"Twenty-one years ago--I stood on this spot, penniless, ragged,\r\nlonely, homeless, helpless, hungry and forlorn.... Hamilton was\r\na cold wilderness for the fugitive when I came there.\"[575] The\r\nexperience of Loguen corroborates what Josiah Henson said of the\r\ngeneral condition of the fugitives as he saw them in 1830: \"At that\r\ntime they were scattered in all directions and for the most part\r\nmiserably poor, subsisting not unfrequently on the roots and herbs\r\nof the fields.... In 1830 there were no schools among them and no\r\nchurches, only occasionally preaching.\"[576]\r\n\r\n  [575] _The Rev. J. W. Loguen as a Slave and as a Freeman_, 1859,\r\n  told by himself; chap. xxiv, pp. 338, 340.\r\n\r\n  [576] _Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_, 1858, p. 209.\r\n\r\nThe whole previous experience of these pioneers was a block to their\r\nmaking a vigorous initiative in their own behalf. Extreme poverty,\r\nignorance and subjection were their inheritance. Their new start in\r\nlife was made with a wretched prospect, and it would be difficult\r\nto imagine a free lot more discouraging and hopeless. Yet it was\r\nbrightened much by the compassionate interest of the Canadian\r\npeople, who were so tolerant as to admit them to a share in the\r\nequal rights that could at that time be found in America only in the\r\nterritory of a monarchical government. By the year 1838 the fugitive\r\nhost of Canada West began to profit by organized efforts in its\r\nbehalf. A mission of Upper Canada was established. It was described\r\nas including \"the colored people who have emigrated from the United\r\nStates and settled in various parts of Upper Canada to enjoy the\r\ninalienable rights of freedom.\"[577] During the winter of 1838-1839,\r\nthis enterprise conducted four schools, while the Rev. Hiram Wilson,\r\nwho seems to have been acting under other auspices, was supervising\r\nduring the same year a number of other schools in the province.[578]\r\n\r\n  [577] _Mission of Upper Canada_, Vol. I, No. 17, Wed., July 31,\r\n  1839.\r\n\r\n  [578] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nFrom this time on much was done in Canada to help the ransomed slave\r\nmeet his new conditions. It was not long before the benevolent\r\ninterest of friends from the Northern states followed the refugees\r\nto their very settlements as it had succored them on their way\r\nthrough the free states. In 1844 Levi Coffin and William Beard made\r\na tour of inspection in Canada West. This was the first of several\r\ntrips made by these two Quakers \"to look after the welfare of the\r\nfugitives\"[579] in that region. The Rev. Samuel J. May made two such\r\ntrips, \"the first time to Toronto and its neighborhood, the second\r\ntime to that part of Canada which lies between Lake Erie and Lake\r\nHuron.\"[580] John Brown did not fail to keep himself informed by\r\npersonal visits how the fugitives were faring there.[581] Men less\r\nprominent but not less interested among underground magnates were\r\ndrawn to see how their former protégés were prospering; such were\r\nAbram Allen, a Hicksite Friend of Clinton County, Ohio, and Reuben\r\nGoens, a South Carolinian by birth, who became an enthusiastic\r\ncoworker with the Quakers at Fountain City, Indiana, in aiding\r\nslaves to the Dominion.\r\n\r\n  [579] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, p. 253.\r\n\r\n  [580] May, _Recollections of the Anti-Slavery Conflict_, p. 303.\r\n\r\n  [581] Hinton, _John Brown and His Men_, p. 175.\r\n\r\nThese efforts were helpful to multitudes of negroes. Some insight\r\ninto the work that was being accomplished is afforded by Levi\r\nCoffin, who gives a valuable account of his Canadian trip,\r\nSeptember to November, 1844. Among the first places he visited was\r\nAmherstburg, more commonly known at that time by the name of Fort\r\nMalden: \"While at this place, we made our headquarters at Isaac\r\nJ. Rice's missionary buildings, where he had a large school for\r\ncolored children. He had labored here among the colored people,\r\nmostly fugitives, for six years. He was a devoted, self-denying\r\nworker, had received very little pecuniary help, and had suffered\r\nmany privations. He was well situated in Ohio, as pastor of a\r\nPresbyterian church, and had fine prospects before him, but believed\r\nthat the Lord called him to this field of missionary labor among\r\nthe fugitive slaves who came here by hundreds and by thousands,\r\npoor, destitute, ignorant, suffering from all the evil influences\r\nof slavery. We entered into deep sympathy with him in his labors,\r\nrealizing the great need there was here for just such an institution\r\nas he had established. He had sheltered at this missionary home many\r\nhundreds of fugitives till other homes for them could be found.\r\nThis was the great landing-point, the principal terminus of the\r\nUnderground Railroad of the West.\"[582] Later Mr. Coffin and his\r\ncompanion \"visited the institution under the care of Hiram Wilson,\r\ncalled the British and American Manual Labor Institute for colored\r\nchildren.\"[583] \"The school was then,\" he reports, \"in a prosperous\r\ncondition.\" Mr. Coffin continues: \"From this place we proceeded\r\nup the river Thames to London, visiting the different settlements\r\nof colored people on our way, and then went to the Wilberforce\r\nColony.... I often met fugitives who had been at my house ten or\r\nfifteen years before, so long ago that I had forgotten them, and\r\ncould recall no recollection of them until they mentioned some\r\ncircumstance that brought them to mind. Some of them were well\r\nsituated, owned good farms, and were perhaps worth more than their\r\nformer masters.... We found many of the fugitives more comfortably\r\nsituated than we expected, but there was much destitution and\r\nsuffering among those who had recently come in. Many fugitives\r\narrived weary and footsore, with their clothing in rags, having\r\nbeen torn by briers and bitten by dogs on their way, and when\r\nthe precious boon of freedom was obtained, they found themselves\r\npossessed of little else, in a country unknown to them and a climate\r\nmuch colder than that to which they were accustomed. We noted the\r\ncases and localities of destitution, and after our return home took\r\nmeasures to collect and forward several large boxes of clothing and\r\nbedding to be distributed by reliable agents to the most needy.\"[584]\r\n\r\n  [582] Coffin, _Reminiscences_, pp. 249, 250.\r\n\r\n  [583] _Ibid._, p. 251.\r\n\r\n  [584] Coffin, _Reminiscences_, pp. 252, 253.\r\n\r\nThe government of Canada was not in advance of the public sentiment\r\nof the provinces when it gave the incoming blacks considerate\r\ntreatment. It was early a puzzle in Mr. Clay's mind why Ontario\r\nand the mother country should yield unhindered entrance to such a\r\nclass of colonists; his opinion of the character of the absconding\r\nslaves and of the unadvisability of their being received by Canada\r\nwas expressed in a despatch of 1826 to the United States minister\r\nat London: \"They are generally the most worthless of their class,\r\nand far, therefore, from being an acquisition which the British\r\ngovernment can be anxious to make. The sooner, we should think, they\r\nare gotten rid of the better for Canada.\"[585] But the Canadians\r\ndid not at any time adopt this view. Dr. Howe testified in 1863\r\nthat \"the refugees have always received ... from the better class\r\nof people, good-will and justice, and from a few, active friendship\r\nand important assistance.\"[586] The attitude of the Canadian\r\ngovernment toward this class of immigrants was always one of welcome\r\nand protection. Not only was there no obstruction put in the way\r\nof their settling in the Dominion, but rather there was the clear\r\npurpose to see them shielded from removal and to foster among them\r\nthe accumulation of property.\r\n\r\n  [585] _Niles' Register_, Vol. XXV, p. 289.\r\n\r\n  [586] Howe, _Refugees in Canada West_, p. 68.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the acquirement of land no discrimination was made\r\nby the Canadian authorities against the fugitive settlers. On the\r\ncontrary these unpromising purchasers were encouraged to take up\r\ngovernment land and become tillers of the soil. In 1844 Levi Coffin\r\nfound that \"Land had been easily obtained and many had availed\r\nthemselves of this advantage to secure comfortable homesteads.\r\nGovernment land had been divided up into fifty-acre lots, which they\r\ncould buy for two dollars an acre, and have ten years in which to\r\npay for it, and if it was not paid for at the end of that time they\r\ndid not lose all the labor they had bestowed on it, but received a\r\nclear title to the land as soon as they paid for it.\"[587]\r\n\r\n  [587] Levi Coffin, _Reminiscences_, pp. 252, 253.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 or 1849 a company was formed in Upper Canada, under the\r\nname of the Elgin Association, for the purpose of settling colored\r\nfamilies upon crown or clergy reserve lands to be purchased in the\r\ntownship of Raleigh. It was intended thus to supply the families\r\nsettled with stimulus to moral improvement.[588] To whom is to\r\nbe attributed the origin of this enterprise is not altogether\r\nclear; one writer ascribes it to the influence of Lord Elgin,\r\nGovernor-General of Canada from 1849 to 1854, and asserts that a\r\ntract of land of eighteen thousand acres was allotted for a refugee\r\nsettlement in 1848;[589] another says it was first projected by the\r\nRev. William King, a Louisiana slaveholder, in 1849.[590] Mr. King's\r\nown statement is that a company of fifteen slaves he had himself\r\nemancipated became the nucleus of the settlement in 1849; and\r\nthat under an act of incorporation procured by himself in 1850 an\r\nassociation was formed to purchase nine thousand acres of land and\r\nhold it for fugitive settlers.[591]\r\n\r\n  [588] Benjamin Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 292.\r\n\r\n  [589] George Bryce, _Short History of the Canadian People_, p.\r\n  403.\r\n\r\n  [590] Benjamin Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 291.\r\n\r\n  [591] S.

Hiram Wilson, to admit all supplies\r\nintended for the refugees free of customs-duty. Mr. E. Child, a\r\nmission-teacher, educated at Oneida Institute, New York, received\r\nmany boxes of such goods at Toronto;[592] and at a hamlet called\r\n\"the Corners,\" a few miles from Detroit, a Mr. Miller kept a depot\r\nfor \"fugitive goods.\" Supplies were also shipped to Detroit direct\r\nfor transmission across the frontier.[593]\r\n\r\n  [592] _History of Knox County, Illinois_ (published by Charles C.\r\n  Chapman and Co.), p. 203. Here it is stated: \"Mr. Wilson arranged\r\n  with the authorities to have all supplies for the fugitive\r\n  slaves admitted free of customs duty. Many were the large\r\n  well-filled boxes of what was most needed by the wanderer taken\r\n  from the wharf at Toronto during that winter [1841] by E. Child,\r\n  mission-teacher. He was then a student at Oneida Institute, N.Y.,\r\n  but for many years has resided in Oneida, this county. He went\r\n  into Canada for the purpose of teaching the fugitives.\"\r\n\r\n  [593] Conversation with Jacob Cummings, a fugitive from\r\n  Tennessee, now living in Columbus, O. Mr. Cummings was at one\r\n  time a collecting agent for a settlement at Puce, Ont. He told\r\n  the author, \"While agent, I was sent to Sandusky. I would\r\n  collect goods for the settlement, and ship it to Detroit, marked\r\n  'Fugitive Goods.' Brother Miller, at the Corners, a little place\r\n  about fifteen miles from Detroit, would take care of these, and\r\n  Canada wouldn't charge any duty on 'fugitive goods.'\"\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending the settlement of the refugees from\r\nslavery in Canada were favorable to their kindly reception by the\r\nnative peoples. It was generally known that they had suffered many\r\nhardships on their journey northward, and that they usually came\r\nwith nought but the unquenchable yearning for a liberty denied them\r\nby the United States. The movement to Canada had begun when the\r\ninter-lake portion of Ontario was largely an unsettled region; and\r\nindeed, during the period of the refugees' immigration, much of the\r\ninterior was in the process of clearing. Moreover, the movement\r\nwas one of small beginnings and gradual development. It brought\r\ninto the country what it then needed--agricultural labor to open up\r\ngovernment land and to help the native farmers.\r\n\r\nIn the elbow of land lying between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, the\r\nfugitives were early received by the Indians under Chief Brant,\r\nhaving possessions along the Grand River and near Burlington Bay.\r\nFinding hospitality on these estates, the negroes not infrequently\r\nadopted the customs and mode of life of their benefactors, and\r\nremained among them.[594]\r\n\r\n  [594] J. C. Hamilton, _Magazine of American History_, Vol. XXV,\r\n  p. 238.\r\n\r\nIn the territory extending westward along the lake front white\r\nsettlers were working their clearings, which were beginning to\r\ntake on the aspect of cultivated farms. But farm hands were not\r\nplentiful, and the fugitive slaves were penniless, and eager to\r\nreceive wages on their own account. Mr. Benjamin Drew, who made\r\na tour of investigation among these people in 1855, and wrote\r\ndown the narratives of more than a hundred colored refugees,\r\ngives testimony to show that in some quarters at least, as in the\r\nvicinity of Colchester, Dresden and Dawn, the number of laborers\r\nwas not equal to the demand, and that the negroes readily found\r\nemployment.[595] It was not to be expected that the field-hands and\r\nhouse-servants of the South could work to the best advantage in\r\ntheir new surroundings; a gentleman of Windsor told Mr. Drew that\r\nimmigrants whose experience in agricultural pursuits had been gained\r\nin Pennsylvania and other free states were more capable and reliable\r\nthan those coming directly to Canada from Southern bondage.[596] But\r\nsuch was the disposition of the white people in different parts of\r\nCanada, and such the demand for laborers in this developing section,\r\nthat the Canada Anti-Slavery Society could say of the refugees, in\r\nits _Second Report_ (1853): \"The true principle is now to assume\r\nthat every man, unless disabled by sickness, can support himself\r\nand his family after he has obtained steady employment. All that\r\nable-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice\r\nand a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first.\r\nThose who are really willing to work can procure employment in a\r\nshort time after their arrival.\"[597]\r\n\r\n  [595] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, pp. 311, 368.\r\n\r\n  [596] _Ibid._, p. 322.\r\n\r\n  [597] Quoted by Drew, p. 326.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there were large tracts of good land in the portion of\r\nCanada accessible to the fugitive was a fortunate circumstance, for\r\nthe desire to possess and cultivate their own land was wide-spread\r\namong the escaped slaves. This eagerness drew many of them into the\r\nCanadian wilderness, there to cut out little farms for themselves,\r\nand live the life of pioneers. The extensive tract known as the\r\nQueen's Bush, lying southwest of Toronto and stretching away to\r\nLake Huron, was early penetrated by refugees. William Jackson, one\r\nof the first colored settlers in this region, says that he entered\r\nit in 1846, when scarcely any one was to be found there, that other\r\nfugitive slaves soon followed in considerable numbers and cleared\r\nthe land, and that in less than two years as many as fifty families\r\nhad located there. The land proved to be good, was well timbered\r\nwith hard wood, and farms of from fifty to a hundred acres in extent\r\nwere soon put in cultivation.[598] In some other parts of Canada the\r\nsame tendency to spread into the outlying districts and secure small\r\nholdings appeared among the colored people. Mr. Peter Wright, the\r\nreeve of the town of Colchester, noted this fact, and attributed the\r\nclearance of much land for cultivation to fugitive slaves.[599] That\r\nsuch land did not always remain in the possession of this class of\r\npioneers was due to their ignorance of the forms of conveyancing,\r\nand doubtless sometimes to the sharp practices of unscrupulous\r\nwhites.[600]\r\n\r\n  [598] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 190.\r\n\r\n  [599] _Ibid._, p. 367.\r\n\r\n  [600] _Ibid._, pp. 367, 369; Austin Steward, _Twenty-two Years a\r\n  Slave, and Forty Years a Freeman_, p. 272.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV.

The\r\nmost important of the colonies thus formed were the Dawn Settlement\r\nat Dresden, the Elgin Settlement at Buxton and the Refugees'\r\nHome near Windsor.[601] These three communities deserve special\r\nconsideration, inasmuch as they illustrate an interesting movement\r\nin which benevolent persons in Canada, England and the United States\r\ncoöperated to improve the condition of the refugees.\r\n\r\n  [601] Howe, _Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 68, 69.\r\n\r\nThe Dawn Settlement, the first of the three established, may be\r\nsaid to have had its beginning in the organization of a school\r\ncalled the British and American Institute.[602] The purpose to\r\nfound such a school seems to have been cherished by the missionary,\r\nthe Rev. Hiram Wilson, and his coworker, Josiah Henson, as early\r\nas 1838; but the plan was not undertaken until 1842.[603] In that\r\nyear a convention of colored persons was called to decide upon the\r\nexpenditure of some fifteen hundred dollars collected in England by\r\na Quaker named James C. Fuller; and they decided, under suggestion,\r\nto start \"a manual-labor school, where children could be taught\r\nthose elements of knowledge which are usually the occupations of a\r\ngrammar-school; and where the boys could be taught, in addition, the\r\npractice of some mechanic art, and the girls could be instructed in\r\nthose domestic arts which are the proper occupation and ornament\r\nof her sex.\"[604] It was decided to locate the school at Dawn,\r\nand accordingly three hundred acres of land were purchased there,\r\nupon which were erected log buildings and schoolhouses, and soon\r\nthe work of instruction was begun. It was \"an object from the\r\nbeginning, of those who ... managed the affairs of the Institute,\r\nto make it self-supporting, by the employment of the students, for\r\ncertain portions of their time, on the land.\"[605] The advantages of\r\nschooling on this basis attracted many refugee settlers to Dresden\r\nand Dawn. The Institute also gave shelter to fugitive slaves \"until\r\nthey could be placed out upon the wild lands in the neighborhoods to\r\nearn their own subsistence.\"\r\n\r\n  [602] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 308.\r\n\r\n  [603] _The Life of Josiah Henson, formerly a Slave, as narrated\r\n  by Himself_, 1852, p. 115. See also _Father Henson's Story of\r\n  His Own Life_, 1858, p. 171. Mr. Drew ascribes the honor of the\r\n  original conception of this Institute to the Rev. Hiram Wilson.\r\n  (See _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 311.) Mr. Henson, after\r\n  asserting that he and Mr. Wilson called the convention of 1838,\r\n  continues, \"I urged the appropriation of the money to the\r\n  establishment of a manual-labor school....\" (_Father Henson's\r\n  Story of His Own Life_, p. 169.) It appears that both Wilson and\r\n  Henson were placed on the committee on site. As they were friends\r\n  and coworkers, it is safe to accord them equal shares in the\r\n  undertaking.\r\n\r\n  [604] _Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_, p. 169.\r\n\r\n  [605] _The Life of Josiah Henson, formerly a Slave, as narrated\r\n  by Himself_, p. 115.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Wilson served the Institute during the first seven\r\nyears of its existence, teaching its school, and ministering to\r\nsuch refugees as came. The number of \"boarding-scholars\" with\r\nwhich he began was fourteen, and at that time \"there were no\r\nmore than fifty colored persons in all the vicinity of the tract\r\npurchased.\"[606] In 1852 there were about sixty pupils attending the\r\nschool, and the settlers on the land of the Institute had increased\r\nto five hundred;[607] while other colonies in the same region had,\r\ncollectively, a population of between three thousand and four\r\nthousand colored people.[608] From what has been said it is easy\r\nto see that the influence of Dawn Institute was considerable; its\r\nmanagers were not content that it should instruct the children of\r\ncolored persons only; they extended the advantages of the school\r\nto the children of whites and Indians as well. Adult students were\r\nalso admitted, and varied in number from fifty-six to one hundred\r\nand sixteen.[609] The good results of the policy thus pursued\r\nare apparent in the character and habits of the communities that\r\ndeveloped under the influence of the Institute.\r\n\r\n  [606] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 311.\r\n\r\n  [607] _First Annual Report of the Anti-Slavery Society of\r\n  Canada_, p. 17. See also Drew's _North-Side View_, p. 311.\r\n\r\n  [608] _Life of Josiah Henson, formerly a Slave, as narrated by\r\n  Himself_, p. 118.\r\n\r\n  [609] _Ibid._, p. 117.\r\n\r\nConcerning these communities Mr. Drew observed: \"The colored people\r\nin the neighborhood of Dresden and Dawn are generally prosperous\r\nfarmers--of good morals.... But here, as among all people, are a\r\nfew persons of doubtful character, who have not been trained 'to\r\nlook out for a rainy day,'--and when these get a little beforehand\r\nthey are apt to rest on their oars.... Some of the settlers are\r\nmechanics,--shoemakers, blacksmiths and so forth. About one-third\r\nof the adult settlers are in possession of land which is, either in\r\nwhole or in part, paid for.\"[610] In 1855, the year in which these\r\nobservations were made, the Institute had already passed the zenith\r\nof its usefulness, and its buildings were fast falling into a state\r\nof melancholy dilapidation. The cause of this decline is probably to\r\nbe found in the bad feeling, neglect and failure arising out of a\r\ndivided management.[611]\r\n\r\n  [610] _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 309.\r\n\r\n  [611] _Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_, pp. 182-186.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Elgin Settlement is discussed above; whether or\r\nnot it was projected by Lord Elgin in 1848, it is certain that\r\nin 1849 the Rev. William King, a Presbyterian clergyman from\r\nLouisiana, had manumitted and settled slaves on this tract. This\r\ncompany, fifteen in number, formed the nucleus of a community named\r\nBuxton, in honor of Thomas Fowell Buxton, the philanthropist, and\r\nthe rapid growth of the settlement thus begun seems to have led to\r\nthe incorporation of the Elgin Association in August, 1850. It is\r\nprobable that Mr. King early became the chief agent in advancing\r\nthe interests of the settlers, his support being derived mainly\r\nfrom the Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church of Canada.\r\nThe plan that was carried out under his management provided for the\r\nparcelling of the land into farms of fifty acres each, to be had by\r\nthe colonists at the government price, two dollars and fifty cents\r\nper acre, payable in twelve annual instalments. No houses inferior\r\nto the model of a small log house prescribed by the improvement\r\ncommittee were to be erected,[612] although settlers were permitted\r\nto build as much better as they chose. A court of arbitration was\r\nestablished for the adjudication of disputes, and a day-school and\r\nSunday-school gave much needed instruction.\r\n\r\n  [612] The dimensions of the model house-were twenty-four by\r\n  eighteen feet, and twelve feet high.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the Elgin Settlement is set forth in a series of\r\nreports, which afford many interesting facts about the enterprise.\r\nThe number of families that entered the settlement during the first\r\ntwo years and eight months is given as seventy-five;[613] a year\r\nlater this number was increased to one hundred and thirty families,\r\ncomprising five hundred and twenty persons;[614] the year following\r\nthere were a hundred and fifty families in Buxton;[615] and eight\r\nyears later, in 1862, when Dr. Howe visited Canada, he was informed\r\nby Mr. King that the population of the settlement was \"about one\r\nthousand,--men, women and children,\" and that two thousand acres\r\nhad been deeded in fee simple to purchasers, one-third of which had\r\nbeen paid for, principal and interest. The impressions of Dr. Howe\r\nare well worth quoting: \"Buxton is certainly a very interesting\r\nplace. Sixteen years ago it was a wilderness. Now, good highways\r\nare laid out in all directions through the forest; and by their\r\nside, standing back thirty-three feet from the road, are about two\r\nhundred cottages, all built on the same pattern, all looking neat\r\nand comfortable. Around each one is a cleared place, of several\r\nacres, which is well cultivated. The fences are in good order,\r\nthe barns seem well-filled; and cattle and horses, and pigs and\r\npoultry, abound. There are signs of industry and thrift and comfort\r\neverywhere; signs of intemperance, of idleness, of want, nowhere.\r\nThere is no tavern, and no groggery; but there is a chapel and a\r\nschoolhouse.\r\n\r\n  [613] _Third Annual Report_, September, 1852, quoted by Drew in\r\n  _North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 293.\r\n\r\n  [614] _Fourth Annual Report_, September, 1853. See Drew's work,\r\n  p. 294.\r\n\r\n  [615] _Fifth Annual Report_, September, 1854; Drew's work, p. 295.\r\n\r\n\"Most interesting of all are the inhabitants. Twenty years ago most\r\nof them were slaves, who owned nothing, not even their children.\r\nNow they own themselves; they own their houses and farms; and they\r\nhave their wives and children about them. They are enfranchised\r\ncitizens of a government which protects their rights.... The present\r\ncondition of all these colonists, as compared with their former one\r\nis very remarkable.\"[616] Mr. King told Dr. Howe that only three\r\nof the whole number that settled in the colony had their first\r\ninstalment on their farms paid for them by friends;[617] and he\r\nsummed up his experience as follows: \"This settlement is a perfect\r\nsuccess.... Here are men who were bred in slavery, who came here\r\nand purchased land at the government prices, cleared it, bought\r\ntheir own implements, built their own houses after a model, and have\r\nsupported themselves in all material circumstances, and now support\r\ntheir schools, in part.... I consider that this settlement has\r\ndone as well as a white settlement would have done under the same\r\ncircumstances.\"[618]\r\n\r\n  [616] Howe, _Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 70, 71.\r\n\r\n  [617] _Ibid._, p. 108.\r\n\r\n  [618] _Ibid._, p. 110.\r\n\r\nThe colony known as Refugees' Home was the outgrowth of a suggestion\r\nof Henry Bibb, who was himself a fugitive slave. Soon after the\r\npassage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, he proposed the formation\r\nof \"a society which should 'aim to purchase thirty thousand acres of\r\ngovernment land ... in the most suitable sections of Canada ... for\r\nthe homeless refugees from American slavery to settle upon.'\" The\r\nassociation, organized in the summer of 1852, set about carrying out\r\nBibb's plan and accomplishing a work similar to the objects of the\r\nElgin Association. The money required for the purchase of land was\r\nto be obtained partly through contributions and partly through sales\r\nof the farms first marketed. Each family of colonists was to have\r\ntwenty-five acres, \"five of which\" it was to \"receive free of cost,\r\nprovided\" it should \"within three years from the time of occupancy,\r\nclear and cultivate the same.\" For the remaining twenty acres the\r\noriginal price--two dollars an acre--was to be paid in nine equal\r\nannual payments. Those obtaining land from the Association, whether\r\nby purchase or gift, were to hold it for fifteen years before having\r\nthe right to dispose of it.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the association's existence forty lots of\r\ntwenty-five acres each were taken up, and arrangements were made\r\nfor a school and church. Mrs. Laura S. Haviland was employed as a\r\nteacher in the fall of 1852, and at once opened both a day-school\r\nand a Sunday-school. She also organized an unsectarian or Christian\r\nUnion Church, which later entered the Methodist Episcopal\r\ndenomination. The material condition of the settlers Mrs. Haviland\r\ndescribes for us in a few words. She says: \"They had erected a\r\nframe-house for school and meeting purposes. The settlers had built\r\nfor themselves small log houses, and cleared from one to five acres\r\neach on their heavily timbered land, and raised corn, potatoes and\r\nother garden vegetables. A few had put in two and three acres of\r\nwheat, and were doing well for their first year.\"[619]\r\n\r\n  [619] Laura S. Haviland, _A Woman's Life Work_, pp. 192, 196, 201.\r\n\r\nThe three colonies described in the foregoing pages are typical of\r\na number of communities settled upon lands purchased in Canada for\r\ntheir use, and regulated by rules drawn up by the associations that\r\nhad sprung into existence for the benefit of the homeless refugees.\r\nThe assumption upon which these associations proceeded was that\r\nthey were to deal with a class of persons who, notwithstanding\r\ntheir present destitution, were desirous of living worthily in the\r\nstate of freedom to which they had just attained, a class needing\r\ndirection, instruction and opportunity for self-help rather than\r\nsustained charity. It was intended that fugitives should not be left\r\nto work out alone their own salvation, but that the deficiencies of\r\nignorance and inexperience should be mitigated for those willing\r\nto profit by the good offices of the missions. The fugitive aid\r\nsociety did not, as we have already seen, try to prevent the\r\nfugitives from settling together in the form of communities; on\r\nthe contrary, such colonization was the inevitable result of their\r\nprocedure, and doubtless to them it seemed desirable. Such is the\r\nsuggestion contained in the arrangement under which farms were sold\r\nto purchasers by the Elgin and Refugees' Home associations: settlers\r\non the tract of the former agreed to hold their farms for at least\r\nten years without transferring their rights; settlers on the land\r\nof the latter were to keep their holdings for a minimum of fifteen\r\nyears without transfer. In the dealings of the Home Association this\r\nrestriction, we are told, caused some dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhether this segregation of the colored people in localities more\r\nor less apart from the white population of Canada was a good thing\r\nfor the refugees has been questioned. Dr. S. G. Howe studied the\r\nlife of this class in Canada in 1862 as the representative of the\r\nUnited States Freedman's Inquiry Commission, and wrote a report\r\nwhich is indispensable for a knowledge of the conditions surrounding\r\nthe colored settlers in the provinces. He summarizes his judgment\r\nas follows: \"The negroes, going into an inhabited and civilized\r\ncountry, should not be systematically congregated in communities.\r\nTheir natural affinities are strong enough to keep up all desirable\r\nrelations without artificial encouragement. Experience shows that\r\nthey do best when scattered about, and forming a small proportion of\r\nthe whole community.\r\n\r\n\"Next, the discipline of the colonies, though it only subjects the\r\nnegroes to what is considered useful apprenticeship, does prolong a\r\ndependence which amounts almost to servitude; and does not convert\r\nthem so surely into hardy, self-reliant men, as the rude struggle\r\nwith actual difficulties, which they themselves have to face and to\r\novercome, instead of doing so through an agent.\r\n\r\n\"Taken as a whole, the colonists have cost to somebody a great deal\r\nof money and a great deal of effort; and they have not succeeded\r\nso well as many who have been thrown entirely upon their own\r\nresources....\r\n\r\n\"It is just to say that some intelligent persons, friends of the\r\ncolored people, believe that in none of the colonies, not even in\r\nBuxton, do they succeed so well, upon the whole, as those who are\r\nthrown entirely upon their own resources.\"[620]\r\n\r\n  [620] _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 69, 70.\r\n\r\nUpon examination, these objections do not seem to be well grounded.\r\nIt is noteworthy that of the prime movers in the organization of\r\nthe three colonies we have considered, two, Josiah Henson and Henry\r\nBibb, were themselves fugitive slaves; the third, the Rev. William\r\nKing, had been at one time a slave-owner, and the fourth, the Rev.\r\nHiram Wilson, was a missionary among the refugees for many years.\r\nThese men were persons of wide observation and experience among\r\nfugitive slaves. It is safe to say that there were no men in Canada\r\nthat knew better the disadvantages under which the average fugitive,\r\njust arrived from the South, was called upon to begin the struggle\r\nfor a livelihood. And it will be admitted that there were none in\r\nor out of Canada more zealous and self-sacrificing in promoting\r\nthe refugee's interests. These men evidently believed that the\r\nfugitive was not in a condition to do the best for himself upon his\r\nfirst arrival on free soil, that he needed to be delivered in some\r\ndegree from the weight of his ignorance, and guided in his wholesome\r\nambition to secure a home.\r\n\r\nTo the eyes of some Canadian observers those runaways who had\r\nlingered a while in the Northern states before crossing the border\r\ninto Canada appeared to be more vigorous, independent and successful\r\nin all undertakings than their less experienced brethren. Whatever\r\nsuperiority they may have possessed that is not assignable to\r\nnatural endowment, cannot safely be set down to the unchecked play\r\nupon them of rough experiences, or to their facing and vanquishing\r\ngreat discouragements unaided. The runaway slaves that lived in\r\nthe free states were not as a class left to fight their way to\r\nattainable success alone. They settled among friends in anti-slavery\r\nneighborhoods, whether in city or country, and were stimulated by\r\nthe practical interest manifested by these persons in their welfare.\r\nThey were thus enabled to benefit by those educative influences\r\nthat the missions of Canada were organized to supply. It is not\r\nimprobable that some of the refugees whose self-reliant behavior\r\ncalled out the approval of Dr. Howe and others belonged to this\r\ngroup of partly disciplined fugitives. Dr. Howe must have seen many\r\nsuch persons, for his journey in Canada West was not made until\r\n1862, after the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 had driven many of them\r\nfrom the states into the provinces. Drew remarks pertinently: \"The\r\nFugitive Slave Bill drove into Canada a great many who had resided\r\nin the free states. These brought some means with them, and their\r\nefforts and good example have improved the condition of the older\r\nsettlers.\"[621]\r\n\r\n  [621] _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 367.\r\n\r\nThe other group of Canadian refugees--those whose passage had been\r\ndirect from the condition of abject dependence, where the whole\r\nroutine of life had been determined by the master or overseer, to\r\nthe condition of active independence and responsibility, where\r\nthe readiness to take hold and to care for one's own interests\r\nwere required--this group doubtless contained persons of ability\r\nand energy; but they must have been in the minority. During the\r\nlater years of its history the Underground Railroad made flight\r\ncomparatively easy for all who once got out of the slave states, so\r\nthat frail women and young children often went through to Canada\r\nwith little or no difficulty. There were of course many individuals\r\nof extraordinary ability, who had enjoyed in slavery a wider range\r\nof experience than was vouchsafed the average slave; but such people\r\ncould take care of themselves anywhere. Here we are concerned with\r\nthe large number that needed to have the way pointed out to them if\r\nthey were ever to become the possessors of their own homes; they\r\nwere not sufficiently informed to originate and carry on successful\r\nbuilding and loan associations for themselves, but they certainly\r\ncould profit by an institution devised to serve the same purpose. If\r\nit be admitted that ownership of land and all that that implies was\r\na good thing for the refugee, then it is difficult to see how that\r\nidea could have been better inculcated far and wide than through the\r\nmethods employed by the Canadian organizations.\r\n\r\nBesides enabling refugees to secure homes for themselves there were\r\nother offices the associations conceived to be a part of their duty,\r\nand the performance of which is set forth in their records. The\r\nfirst and most urgent of these was to supply immediate relief to the\r\nwayworn travellers continually arriving; with this was combined the\r\nnecessity of helping these persons to find employment. The British\r\nand American Institute at Dawn was obliged to conduct, as part of\r\nits work, what would now be called perhaps a supply and employment\r\nbureau. Josiah Henson, one of the founders of the Institute,\r\ndescribing this branch of the work, says: \"Many of these poor\r\ncreatures arrive destitute of means, and often in want of suitable\r\nclothing, and these, as far as possible, have been supplied them.\r\nSince the passage of the late Fugitive Slave Bill, ... they have\r\narrived in large numbers at the Institute, and have been drafted\r\noff among their brethren who had been previously settled, and who\r\nare now making every effort and sacrifice to meet their destitute\r\ncircumstances.\"[622] Henry Bibb, of the Refugees' Home, as early as\r\n1843 saw the need of maintaining a stock of supplies at Windsor out\r\nof which to relieve the immediate necessities of fugitives.[623]\r\nThe missionary, Isaac J. Rice, kept a similar supply room at\r\nAmherstburg.[624] It appears from all this that the recognition of\r\nthe deplorable destitution of arriving fugitives was general among\r\nthe aid societies and their representatives, and that prompt action\r\nwas taken to meet wants that could brook no delay.\r\n\r\n  [622] _The Life of Josiah Henson, as narrated by Himself_, p. 117.\r\n\r\n  [623] Conversation with the Rev. Jacob Cummings, a refugee now\r\n  living at Columbus, O.\r\n\r\n  [624] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nAnother service performed by these colonization societies was that\r\nof providing superior schools for the colored people; education for\r\nall that could take it was one of the cardinal features of their\r\nprogramme. The state of public sentiment in some places in Canada\r\nwas such that colored children were either altogether excluded from\r\nthe public schools, or, if allowed to enter, they were annoyed\r\nbeyond endurance by the rude behavior of their fellow-pupils.\r\nIn some places they braved the prejudice against them, but the\r\nnumbers courageous enough to do this were insignificant. Under\r\nsuch circumstances the best that could be done by the friends of\r\nthe black race was to open schools under private management. That\r\nthe societies were not averse to mixed schools is shown by the fact\r\nthat white pupils were admitted in various instances to classes\r\nformed primarily for colored children.[625] This need of schools\r\ndid not appeal alone to the colonization societies. It was seen\r\nand responded to by other organizations; thus the English Colonial\r\nChurch and School Society thought it advisable to locate schools at\r\nLondon,[626] Amherstburg,[627] Colchester[628] and perhaps other\r\nplaces; and certain religious bodies of the United States felt\r\nit incumbent on them to support school-teachers (ten or more) in\r\ndifferent parts of Canada.[629] Besides the schools thus provided\r\na few were conducted by individuals; as examples of this latter\r\nclass may be named a private school at Chatham taught by Alfred\r\nWhipper,[630] a colored man, and another at Windsor managed by Mrs.\r\nMary E. Bibb, the wife of Henry Bibb mentioned above.[631]\r\n\r\n  [625] _First Annual Report of the Anti-Slavery Society of\r\n  Canada_, 1852, Appendix, p. 22.\r\n\r\n  [626] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 148.\r\n\r\n  [627] _Ibid._, p. 349.\r\n\r\n  [628] _Ibid._, p. 369.\r\n\r\n  [629] _First Annual Report of the Anti-Slavery Society of\r\n  Canada_, 1852, p. 22.\r\n\r\n  [630] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 236.\r\n\r\n  [631] _Ibid._, p. 322.\r\n\r\nThe supervision of the colonies maintained by their respective\r\nassociations does not appear to have been unduly strict.\r\nOccasionally controversies came up over what was thought by the\r\nrefugees to be improper assumption of authority by some agent\r\nor representative of the association, but an examination of the\r\nterms under which land was taken by the intending settlers brings\r\nto light only such rules as were meant to foster intelligence,\r\nmorality and sobriety among the colonists. The aid societies were\r\nnot only zealous for education. They also provided against those\r\nevil influences to which they thought the negroes were most likely\r\nto succumb. Thus, for example, in the case of the Buxton[632] and\r\nRefugees' Home settlements the manufacture and sale of intoxicants\r\nwere forbidden. Such regulations seem to have been sustained by\r\nthe sentiment of the communities for which they were made, and\r\nare not known to have been the source of opposition. Indeed, the\r\ndirectors of Buxton specially commended the habits of sobriety\r\nprevalent among the people whose best interests they were striving\r\nto promote,[633] and the Rev. William King found satisfaction in the\r\nfact that a saloon opened on the borders of that settlement could\r\nnot find customers enough to support it, and closed its doors within\r\na twelvemonth. His testimony relating to the standard of social\r\npurity mantained by the colonists was creditable in its showing,\r\nand indicated a high sense of morality scarcely to be expected\r\namong a people stained by the gross practices of slave-life.[634]\r\nOf the colored people in the neighborhood of Dawn Institute the\r\nreports were equally good. Mr. Drew found them to be \"generally\r\nvery prosperous farmers--of good morals, and mostly Methodists and\r\nBaptists.\"[635] Mr. Henson related with evident pride that out of\r\nthe three thousand or four thousand colored people congregated in\r\nthe settlements about Dawn not one had \"been sent to jail for any\r\ninfraction of the laws during the last seven years (1845-1852).\"[636]\r\n\r\n  [632] _Ibid._, pp. 294, 325.\r\n\r\n  [633] _Third Annual Report (1852)_, quoted by Drew, p. 293.\r\n\r\n  [634] Howe, _Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 109, 110.\r\n\r\n  [635] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 309.\r\n\r\n  [636] _The Life of Josiah Henson, formerly a Slave, as narrated\r\n  by Himself_, p. 118.\r\n\r\nThe widest range of dissatisfaction appeared at the Refugees' Home,\r\nwhere the fugitives are reputed to have been unduly burdened.\r\nThomas Jones, not a colonist, and without any personal grievances\r\nto complain of, voiced the feeling to Mr. Drew. After relating\r\nsome annoying changes made in the regulations as to the time in\r\nwhich clearings were to be made, as to the size of the houses to be\r\nerected and so forth, he declared that the settlers \"doubt about\r\ngetting deeds, ... The restrictions in regard to liquor, and not\r\nselling [their land] under so many years, nor the power to will ...\r\nproperty to ... friends, only to children if ... [they] have any,\r\nmake them dissatisfied. They want to do as they please.\" From\r\nthis it appears that the population of Refugees' Home was not\r\naltogether content with the local government under which it lived,\r\nbut apparently the complaints made were to be attributed more to the\r\nunjust changes in the charter of the colony than to the moral régime\r\nthe Home Association sought to enforce.\r\n\r\nIn general we may say, then, that in so far as the three colonies\r\nconsidered were typical of the whole class, there was nothing\r\ninherent in the provisions of their constitutions or in the\r\nnature of their organizations to place their members in a kind of\r\nservitude. As property owners, these citizens became subject to\r\nlegitimate obligations, which might have been differently arranged,\r\nbut could scarcely have been less onerous or of better intention.\r\nThe requirement that ownership should be for a period of ten or\r\nfifteen years, made by the Elgin and Refugees' Home societies,\r\nwas perhaps annoying; but the explanation, if not the full\r\njustification, of such a demand lay in the evident desire of the\r\nsocieties to give all purchasers ample time in which to make their\r\npayments, and in the irresponsibility of the class with which they\r\nwere dealing.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to tell how many landed colonies there were in\r\nCanada. Dr. Howe, perhaps the best contemporary observer, speaks\r\nindefinitely of benevolent persons that formed organizations at\r\nvarious periods for the relief and aid of the refugees, and says\r\nthat these organizations generally took the form of societies for\r\nprocuring tracts of land and settling colonies upon them, but he\r\ngives no further details.[637] Whatever their number, it is quite\r\ncertain that these colonies comprised but a small part of the\r\nrefugee population. The natural tendency was for fugitives to drift\r\nat once to the towns, where there was immediate prospect of relief\r\nand employment. In this way many of the Canadian centres came to\r\nhave an increasing proportion of colored inhabitants. The towns\r\nfirst receiving such additions were naturally those of mercantile\r\nimportance in the lake traffic of the decades before the Civil War.\r\nThus, Amherstburg and Windsor, Port Stanley and Port Burwell, St.\r\nCatherines, Hamilton and Toronto, and Kingston and Montreal, early\r\nbecame important places of resort for escaped slaves.\r\n\r\n  [637] Howe, _Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, p. 69.\r\n\r\nThe movement was normally from these and other centres on the lake\r\nshore, or near it, to the interior. How rapid it was we can only\r\njudge by the few chance indications that remain. During Drew's\r\ntravels in Canada West he learned that in 1832 the town of Chatham\r\nwas a mere hamlet comprising a few houses and two or three shops,\r\nalthough the oldest deed of the place on record is dated 1801.\r\nSteamboats did not begin to ply on the river Sydenham between\r\nChatham and Detroit until 1837. But long before this year, and, in\r\nfact, at the first settlement of the town, colored people began to\r\ncome in.[638] When Levi Coffin made his first trip to Canada, in\r\n1844, he visited a number of settlements of colored people scattered\r\nalong the river Thames north of Dawn, and found the colony at\r\nWilberforce already established.[639] This colony had been founded\r\nas early as 1830, and because it was originally settled by a group\r\nof emancipated slaves, it soon began to attract new settlers from\r\nthe incoming stream of runaways. By 1846 the more distant interior\r\nwas invaded. In that year the long strip of country stretching\r\nfrom the western extremity of Lake Ontario across to Lake Huron,\r\nand designated on the general map as Queen's Bush, was entered by\r\npioneers who had escaped from slavery. This region was not surveyed\r\nuntil about 1848, and by that time there were as many as fifty\r\nfamilies located there.[640] Some time during the years 1845 to\r\n1847, the Rev. R. S. W. Sorrick went as far north as Oro, where\r\nhe found \"some fifty persons settled, many comfortable and doing\r\nwell, but many [suffering] a great deal from poverty.\"[641] The\r\nsurveying of the tract called Queen's Bush, and the subsequent\r\narranging of the terms of payment for land already occupied, caused\r\na number of colored settlers to sell their clearings in \"the Bush\"\r\nand move away. Some of these, it appears, went south to Buxton, but\r\nsome went north to the shores of Georgian Bay and located at Owen\r\nSound.[642] From this testimony it is certain that by 1850 fugitive\r\nslaves had found their way in considerable numbers throughout the\r\ninter-lake portion of Canada West.\r\n\r\n  [638] _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 235.\r\n\r\n  [639] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, p. 521.\r\n\r\n  [640] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 189.\r\n\r\n  [641] _Ibid._, p. 190.\r\n\r\n  [642] Drew, _North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 190.\r\n\r\nFarther east, the Province of Quebec attracted negroes from the\r\nSouthern states as early as the thirties; and they began to make\r\npilgrimages northward by way of secret lines of travel through\r\nNew England. By 1850, there were at least five or six of these\r\nlines, all well patronized, considering their remoteness from\r\nslaveholding territory. Maritime routes, by way of ports along the\r\nNew England coast to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and even Cape\r\nBreton Island, seem also to have existed. A case is cited by the\r\nRev. Austin Willey in his book, entitled _Anti-Slavery in the State\r\nand Nation_, in which more than twenty colored refugees were sent\r\nfrom Portland to New Brunswick at one time, soon after the rescue\r\nof Shadrach in Boston, in 1851. It is reported that there are still\r\nsettlements of ex-slaves in Nova Scotia, near Halifax;[643] and the\r\nstatement has recently been made that \"there are at least two negro\r\nfamilies living in Inverness County, Cape Breton, who are, in all\r\nprobability, the descendants of fugitive slaves.\"[644]\r\n\r\n  [643] A statement to this effect, which appeared in the _Marine\r\n  Journal_ of New York, is quoted in _McClure's Magazine_ for May,\r\n  1897, p. 618.\r\n\r\n  [644] See the letter signed \"D. F.,\" printed in _McClure's\r\n  Magazine_, May, 1897, p. 618.\r\n\r\nAs regards this movement into the Eastern provinces, no detailed\r\ninformation can be had. Even in the Western lake-bound region,\r\nit was the towns that were the most accessible for the traveller\r\ndesirous of studying the condition of fugitives; most visitors\r\ncontented themselves with the briefest memorials of their visits;\r\nand those whose accounts are at the same time helpful and extended,\r\ndescribe or even mention only a limited number of abiding-places\r\nof escaped slaves. Though Drew notices in his book but thirteen\r\ncommunities, and Dr. Howe refers to eleven only, numerous other\r\nplaces are mentioned by other observers. Sketching his first visit\r\nto Canada, Mr. Coffin writes: \"Leaving Gosfield County, we made our\r\nway to Chatham and Sydenham, _visiting the various neighborhoods of\r\ncolored people_. We spent several days at the settlement near Down's\r\nMills, and visited the institution under the care of Hiram Wilson,\r\ncalled the British and American Manual Labor Institute.... From\r\nthis place we proceeded up the river Thames to London, _visiting\r\nthe different settlements of colored people on our way_, and then\r\nwent to the Wilberforce colony.\"[645] After naming a list of\r\ntwelve towns near which refugees had settled, Josiah Henson says:\r\n\"Others are scattered in small numbers in different townships, and\r\nat Toronto there are about four hundred or five hundred variously\r\nemployed....\"[646] Such testimony goes to show that the refugee\r\npopulation of Canada was widely distributed, both in the cities and\r\ntowns and in the country.\r\n\r\n  [645] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, p. 251. The italics are my\r\n  own.\r\n\r\n  [646] _The Life of Josiah Henson, formerly a Slave, as narrated\r\n  by Himself_, p. 100.\r\n\r\nIf the information at hand in regard to the distribution of the\r\nrefugees is unsatisfactory, it can hardly be expected that the\r\nnumbers can now be ascertained. The official figures of the\r\nsuccessive Canadian censuses are untrustworthy. Dr. Howe, who\r\nstudied them, concluded that, \"It is impossible to ascertain the\r\nnumber of exiles who have found refuge in Canada since 1800.... It\r\nis difficult, moreover, to ascertain the present number (1862). The\r\ncensus of 1850 is confused. It puts the number in Upper Canada at\r\n2,502 males and 2,167 females. But in a note it is stated, '_there\r\nare about 8,000 colored persons in Western Canada_.' This word\r\n\"about\" is an admission of the uncertainty; and as if to make that\r\nuncertainty greater, the same census in another part puts the number\r\nin Western Canada at 4,669.\" The census of 1860 Dr. Howe found to be\r\nequally unreliable. In giving the colored population as 11,223, it\r\nunderrated the number greatly, as he discovered by looking into the\r\nrecords of several cities and by making inquiry of town officers. In\r\nthis manner he learned that the number of colored people living in\r\nSt. Catherines was about 700, although the census showed only 472;\r\nin Hamilton, probably more than 500, despite the government showing\r\nof only 62; in Toronto, 934, although the census gave but 510; in\r\nLondon, Canada West, as the mayor estimated, there were 75 families\r\nof colored people, whereas the census showed only 36 persons. \"There\r\nhas been no movement of the colored population,\" Dr. Howe tells\r\nus, \"sufficient to explain such discrepancies; and the conclusion\r\nis that the census of 1850, and that of 1860, included some of the\r\ncolored people in the white column.\"[647]\r\n\r\n  [647] Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 15,\r\n  16.\r\n\r\nIf the information contained in the census reports of the Canadas\r\nrelating to the refugee population of the provinces is misleading,\r\nso also is it true that little value can be attached to the\r\nestimates made at various times by visitors to the communities of\r\nfugitives, most of whom had inadequate data upon which to base their\r\nconclusions. These estimates not only differ widely, but sometimes\r\nleave room for doubt as to what geographical area and period of time\r\nthey are intended to cover. Coffin in 1844 was told that there were\r\nabout forty thousand fugitives in Canada;[648] but eight years later\r\nHenson estimated the number at between twenty thousand and thirty\r\nthousand, and daily increasing.[649] In the same year (1852) the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society of Canada in its _First Annual Report_ stated\r\nthat there were about thirty thousand colored residents in Canada\r\nWest.[650] The Rev. Hiram Wilson said from the lecture platform that\r\nthere were sixty thousand fugitives in Canada, and Elder Anthony\r\nBingey, a coworker with Mr. Wilson, who heard this estimate given\r\nby his friend, informed the writer that Mr. Wilson had travelled\r\nover the country from Toronto westward and was as competent a judge\r\nas could be found in Ontario.[651] John Brown attended a conference\r\nat Chatham in the spring of 1858, and his biographer, Mr. R. J.\r\nHinton, thinks there were probably not less than seventy-five\r\nthousand fugitives living in Canada West at that time.[652] The\r\nRev. W. M. Mitchell, a negro missionary writing in 1860, was of\r\nthe opinion that there were sixty thousand colored people in Upper\r\nCanada, that fifteen thousand of these were free-born, and that the\r\nremaining forty-five thousand were fugitive slaves from the United\r\nStates.[653] The Rev. Dr. Willes, Professor of Divinity in Toronto\r\nCollege, is quoted as having said that there were about sixty\r\nthousand emancipated slaves in Canada, the most of whom had escaped\r\nfrom bondage.[654] Dr. Howe came to the conclusion in 1863 that the\r\nwhole number of slaves enfranchised by residence in the provinces\r\nwas between thirty and forty thousand. He thought that at the time\r\nof his visit the population did not fall below fifteen thousand nor\r\nexceed twenty thousand; although other observers, he said, estimated\r\nit as ranging from twenty thousand to thirty thousand.[655]\r\n\r\n  [648] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, p. 253.\r\n\r\n  [649] _The Life of Josiah Henson, formerly a Slave, as narrated\r\n  by Himself_, Appendix, p. 99.\r\n\r\n  [650] Quoted by Howe in _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada\r\n  West_, p. 17.\r\n\r\n  [651] Conversation with Mr. Bingey, Windsor, Ont., July 31, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [652] _John Brown and His Men_, p. 171.\r\n\r\n  [653] _The Underground Railroad_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n  [654] _Ibid._, p. 166.\r\n\r\n  [655] _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 15, 17.\r\n\r\nBesides the diversity of the figures here presented, it should\r\nbe noted that most of the estimates refer only to Canada West;\r\nand further that they take no account of the losses under a high\r\ndeath-rate, due to the action of the new climatic conditions upon\r\nthe settlers. Travellers were not in possession of the elements\r\nnecessary for a computation, the resident missions were tempted to\r\noverstate, and the Canadian officials did not know how to secure\r\ndata, and, perhaps, did not try to secure them fully. One can only\r\nsay that the numerous lines of Underground Railroad would not have\r\nbeen taxed beyond their capacity to convey a number of refugees\r\nequal to the highest estimate given above during the period these\r\nlines are known to have been active.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of escaped slaves were possessed of but little\r\nmore than the boon of freedom when they arrived in what was for\r\nthem \"the promised land.\" Church missions, anti-slavery societies\r\nand colonies found in them worthy subjects for their benefactions,\r\nwhich were intended to put the recipients in the way of earning\r\ntheir own livelihood. The need of clothing, shelter and employment\r\nwas provided for as promptly as circumstances would allow, and the\r\nfugitives soon came to realize that the efforts made in their behalf\r\nwere to help them attain that independence of which they had been so\r\nlong deprived.\r\n\r\nAs the region to which the refugees had recourse in largest numbers\r\nwas well covered with forests, and was beginning to be cleared\r\nfor tillage, a common occupation among them was that of the\r\nwoodsman. Many were able to hire themselves to the native farmers\r\nto cut timber, while many others, who arranged to lease or buy\r\nland, went to work to clear garden patches and little farms for\r\nthemselves. Josiah Henson sought to develop a lumber industry in\r\nthe neighborhood of Dawn by setting up a sawmill on the farm of\r\nthe British and American Institute, and shipping its products to\r\nBoston and New York.[656] Such work, in a climate to which they were\r\nunaccustomed, was an experience beyond the strength of some of the\r\nfugitives; and their exposure to the cold of the Canadian winter\r\nsowed the seeds of consumption in many.[657]\r\n\r\n  [656] _Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_, p. 173 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  [657] This is substantiated by the testimony of various Canadian\r\n  refugees.\r\n\r\nFarming appears to have been the occupation naturally preferred\r\nby the refugees, and probably the majority of them looked forward\r\nto owning farms.[658] It was the pursuit their masters followed,\r\nand for which they themselves were best adapted. The way to it was\r\nopen through the demand for farm-hands on the part of many white\r\nsettlers, and the special encouragement frequently needed was\r\nsupplied by the example and aid of one or another of the colonies.\r\n\r\n  [658] _First Annual Report of the Anti-Slavery Society of\r\n  Canada_, p. 15.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that a considerable number of the fugitives\r\ncontented themselves with the present enjoyment of their newly\r\nacquired liberty, and neglected to make provision for the future.\r\nSuch persons were quite ready to work, but were slow to understand\r\nhow they could acquire land in time, and secure the full profits\r\nof their labor to themselves. The weight of enforced ignorance,\r\ndependence and poverty was upon them. Not infrequently they entered\r\ninto profitless bargains, leasing wild lands on short terms, and\r\nfinding themselves dispossessed when their clearings were about\r\nready for advantageous cultivation.[659] Their knowledge of\r\nagriculture was scanty, and their planting, in consequence, often\r\ninjudicious. They were, however, zealous to learn. The Rev. R. S.\r\nW. Sorrick, who gave some instruction to the settlers at Oro in the\r\nart of farming, declared them to be a most teachable people.[660]\r\nThe refugees at Colchester appear to have been equally open-minded\r\nto the practical suggestions given them in a series of lectures on\r\n\"crops, wages and profit\" delivered before them by Mr. Henson.\r\n\r\n  [659] _Father Henson's Story of His Own Life_, pp. 165, 166;\r\n  Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, pp. 196, 369.\r\n\r\n  [660] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 120.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that among the slave-owners of the border states\r\nthe practice existed widely of entrusting some of their negroes\r\nwith the responsibilities of farm management; and that in the same\r\nportion of the South slaves were often permitted to hire their\r\nown time for farm labor; thousands of runaways also had gathered\r\nexperience in the free states before their emigration to Canada;\r\nhence one is prepared in a measure to understand the rapid strides\r\nmade by a large class of the negro population in the country of\r\ntheir adoption. Many of these people already had a gauge of their\r\nability, and were not afraid to go forward in the acquirement of\r\nlands and homes of their own. To the advancement made by this\r\nnumerous class is due the favorable comment called forth from\r\nobserving persons, both Canadians and visiting Americans. Dr. Howe\r\nhas left us some interesting information concerning the condition of\r\nrefugee farmers in Canada. He found some cultivating small gardens\r\nof their own near large towns, where they had a ready market for the\r\nproduce they raised; others, more widely scattered, tilled little\r\nfarms, which for the most part were clear of encumbrance; these\r\nfarms were \"inferior to the first-class farms of their region in\r\npoint of cultivation, fences, stock and the like,\" but were \"equal\r\nto the average of second-class farms\"; their owners lacked the\r\ncapital, intelligence and skill of the best farmers, but, far from\r\nbeing lazy, stupid or thriftless, supported themselves in a fair\r\ndegree of comfort, and occupied houses not easily distinguishable\r\nin appearance from the farmhouses of their white neighbors. The\r\nmiserable hut of the worthless negro squatter was occasionally to\r\nbe seen, but usually the rude cabin and small clearing marked the\r\nspot where a newly arrived fugitive had begun his home, which in\r\ndue course was to pass through successive stages until it should\r\nbecome a well-cleared farm, with good buildings and a large stock of\r\nanimals and tools.[661]\r\n\r\n  [661] _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 65, 66. See\r\n  also Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 368.\r\n\r\nA fact deplored by some friends of the refugees was the inclination\r\nto congregate in towns and cities.[662] A committee of investigation\r\nappointed by the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada reported in 1852\r\nthat, although many fugitives were scattered through the various\r\ndistricts, the larger number was massing in certain localities,\r\nthose named being Elgin, Dawn and Colchester village settlements,\r\nSandwich, Queen's Bush, Wilberforce, Hamilton and St. Catherines,\r\ntogether with the Niagara district and Toronto.[663] According to\r\nJosiah Henson the towns about which these people were gathering were\r\nChatham, Riley, Sandwich, Anderton (probably Anderson), Malden,\r\nColchester, Gonfield (doubtless Gosfield), London, Hamilton and the\r\ncolonies at Dawn and Wilberforce.[664] Other centres undoubtedly\r\nexisted, though no exhaustive list of such places could be made from\r\nthe meagre accounts left us.\r\n\r\n  [662] Mitchell, _The Underground Railroad_, p. 128.\r\n\r\n  [663] _First Annual Report of the Society_, pp. 16, 17.\r\n\r\n  [664] _The Life of Josiah Henson, formerly a Slave, as narrated\r\n  by Himself_, p. 100.\r\n\r\nThe movement to the towns was natural, for friends and employment\r\nwere more easily to be found there than elsewhere. Certain parts or\r\nquarters of the towns rapidly filled up with the negroes, and the\r\nbonds of race and sympathy came into full play, causing constant\r\naccretions of new settlers. This was especially true of Fort Malden\r\nor Amherstburg, for years the principal port of entry for fugitives\r\nlanding from the Michigan and Ohio borders. The result in this\r\nand similar cases was unsatisfactory; the people seemed not to do\r\nas well as in other places.[665] In Hamilton and Toronto, we are\r\ntold, the dwellings of the blacks were scattered among those of\r\nthe whites, instead of being crowded together in a single suburban\r\nlocality more or less distinct from the city of which it formed a\r\npart.[666] However, local conditions existing in Toronto, such as\r\nrent charges, tended to confine the colored people to the northwest\r\nsection of the city.[667]\r\n\r\n  [665] Dr. Howe quotes the following statement from Mr. Brush,\r\n  town clerk of Malden: \"A portion of them (the colored people)\r\n  are pretty well behaved, and another portion not.... A great\r\n  many of these colored people go and sail (are sailors) in the\r\n  summer-time, and in the winter lie around, and don't do much....\r\n  We have to help a great many of them, more than any other class\r\n  of people we have here. I have been clerk of the council for\r\n  three years, and have had the opportunity of knowing. I think\r\n  the council have given more to the colored people than to any\r\n  others.\" See also _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 58.\r\n\r\n  [666] _A North-Side View of Slavery_, p. 62.\r\n\r\n  [667] _Ibid._, p. 94.\r\n\r\nA wide range of occupations was open to the refugees in the towns;\r\nbesides the lighter kinds of service about hotels and other public\r\nhouses, and the work of plastering and whitewashing, often performed\r\nby negroes, various trades were followed, such as blacksmithing,\r\ncarpentering, building, painting, mill-work and other handicrafts.\r\nThere were good negro mechanics in Hamilton, Chatham, Windsor,\r\nAmherstburg and other places. A few were engaged in shopkeeping,\r\nor were employed as clerks, while a still smaller number devoted\r\nthemselves to teaching and preaching.\r\n\r\nAs a class the fugitives in the towns, as in the country, were\r\naccounted steady and industrious, and their dwellings were said\r\nto be \"generally superior to those of the Irish, or other foreign\r\nemigrants of the laboring class,\" and \"far superior to the\r\nnegro huts upon slave plantations, which many of them formerly\r\ninhabited.\"[668] Dr. J. Wilson Moore, of Philadelphia, visited\r\nthe refugee communities in various Canadian towns, for example\r\nat Chatham, London and Wilberforce, and was favorably impressed\r\nwith what he saw; with the orderly deportment of the crowds of\r\ncolored people at Chatham while returning from a celebration of\r\nthe anniversary of the West Indian emancipation, with the air of\r\nneatness and comfort displayed by the homes of the fugitives at\r\nLondon, with the advance from log cabins to brick and frame-houses\r\nmade by the settlers at Wilberforce.[669] The weight of evidence\r\nsupplied by Mr. Drew was unquestionably favorable to the view\r\nthat the refugees were making substantial progress. He found the\r\ncondition of the colored people in Toronto such as to be a proper\r\ncause of satisfaction for the philanthropist; many men in Hamilton\r\nwere well-to-do; concerning those living in London he learned that\r\nsome were highly intelligent and respectable, but that others\r\nwasted their time and neglected their opportunities; he noted that\r\nthere was great activity among the negroes at Chatham, where they\r\nengaged in a large variety of manual pursuits; at Windsor, almost\r\nall the members of this class had comfortable homes, and some owned\r\nneat and handsome houses; at Sandwich a few were house-owners, the\r\nrest were tenants; in Amherstburg the assurance was given that the\r\ncolored people of Canada were doing better than the free negroes in\r\nthe United States; the settlers at New Canaan were reported to be\r\nmaking extraordinary progress, considering the length of time they\r\nhad lived there; and out of a colored population of seventy-eight at\r\nGosfield all of the heads of families, with two or three exceptions,\r\nwere freeholders.[670] Dr. Howe, who visited the houses of the\r\ncolored people in the outskirts of Chatham and other large places,\r\ndescribed them as being for the most part small and tidy two-story\r\nhouses with garden lots about them, neatly furnished, the tables\r\ndecently spread and plentifully supplied. He was convinced that the\r\nfugitive slaves lived better than foreign immigrants in the same\r\nregion, and clothed their children better.[671]\r\n\r\n  [668] Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, p. 63.\r\n\r\n  [669] Still, _Underground Railroad Records_, p. xvii.\r\n\r\n  [670] _A North-Side View of Slavery_, pp. 94, 119, 147, 234, 321,\r\n  344, 348, 376, 378.\r\n\r\n  [671] _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 63, 64. See\r\n  also Mitchell's _Underground Railroad_, pp. 130, 131, 133, 135,\r\n  137-139, 142-144, 146, 148 _et seq._\r\n\r\nThe relation of the slave to his wife and children was a precarious\r\none in the South, especially in the border region from which most\r\nof the Canadian exiles came. Slave-breeding for the Southern market\r\nwas extensively carried on in Virginia, Kentucky and other border\r\nstates; slave-traders made frequent trips through this section; and\r\ntheir coming brought consternation, distress and separation to many\r\na slave-family. These and other violations of the domestic ties\r\nmight be expected to react on the home life of the slave-family,\r\ntending to discourage regard for the forms of family life, and to\r\ntake away incentive to constancy. In view of such degradation it is\r\nsurprising to note the care taken by many refugees for the formal\r\nlegitimation of the alliances made by them in slavery. Once secure\r\nin their freedom and in their domestic relations, they began to\r\nsubstitute for the marriage after \"slave fashion\" the legal form of\r\nmarriage, which they saw observed about them in Canada. Dr. Howe\r\nnoticed that the fugitives settled themselves in families, respected\r\nthe sanctity of marriage, and showed a general improvement in\r\nmorals.[672]\r\n\r\n  [672] _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 95, 101,\r\n  Appendix, pp. 109, 110. In her book, _A Woman's Life Work_, p.\r\n  193, Mrs. Laura S. Haviland reports some interesting cases of\r\n  this sort.\r\n\r\nThis recognition of a new standard of social virtue signifies a\r\ngreat gain on the part of the refugees. As the withholding of any\r\nreal instruction from the slaves in the South helped to brutalize\r\nthem, so their moral elevation in Canada went hand in hand with\r\ntheir enlightenment through schools and religious teaching. What\r\nadvantages were afforded them in the way of education in their new\r\nabiding-place, and what measure of benefit did they derive from\r\nthese opportunities?\r\n\r\nIt appears that under the Canadian law colored people were permitted\r\neither to send their children to the common schools or to have\r\nseparate schools provided from their proportionate share of the\r\nschool funds. In some districts, however, local conditions stood in\r\nthe way of the education of colored children. Many of the parents\r\ndid not appreciate the need of sending their children to school\r\nregularly; it often happened that they were too destitute to take\r\nadvantage of these opportunities; again, they were unaccustomed to\r\nthe enjoyment of equal privileges with the whites and were timid\r\nabout assuming them. The children, unused to the climate of the new\r\ncountry, perhaps also thinly clad, were sickly and often unable to\r\ngo to school.[673]\r\n\r\n  [673] Mitchell, _The Underground Railroad_, pp. 140, 164, 165.\r\n\r\nPrejudice was also not wanting in some quarters among the whites.\r\nIn the town of Sandwich, on the Detroit River, in 1851 or 1852, the\r\nfeelings of the two people were much agitated over the question\r\nof mixed schools.[674] The towns of Chatham, London and Hamilton\r\nappear also to have been more or less affected by prejudice against\r\nthe negro.[675] Partly owing to this prejudice, and partly to their\r\nown preference, the colored people, acting under the provision of\r\nthe law that allowed them to have separate schools, set up their\r\nown schools in Sandwich and in many other parts of Ontario.[676]\r\nDrew incidentally noted the existence of separate schools at\r\nColchester, Amherstburg, Sandwich, Dawn and Buxton; the existence\r\nof private schools at London, Windsor and perhaps one or two other\r\nplaces; and the presence of an extremely small number of colored\r\nchildren in the common schools at Hamilton and London. Concerning\r\nToronto, he tells us that no distinction existed there in regard\r\nto school privileges. Such figures as Drew supplies show the\r\nseparate, private and mission schools to have been more numerously\r\nattended than the public or common schools. The former furnished\r\nthe conditions under which whatever appreciation of education there\r\nwas native in a community of negroes, or whatever taste for it\r\ncould be awakened there, was free to assert itself unhindered by\r\nreal or imagined opposition. That the refugees were capable of a\r\ngenuine interest in the schools provided for them, even under the\r\nmost disheartening circumstances, appears from the fact that \"many\r\nof the colored settlers were attracted to Dresden and Dawn by the\r\npreferred advantages of education on the industrial plan in the Dawn\r\nInstitute.\"[677] Adults and children both attended; the schools of\r\nthe mission-workers were intended to reach as many as possible of a\r\nconstituency made up largely of grown persons. An evening school for\r\nadults was established in Toronto, and had a good attendance.[678]\r\nSunday-schools were an important accessory, furnishing, as they did,\r\nopportunities to many whose week days were full of other cares.\r\nMrs. Haviland's experience was probably that of mission-teachers\r\nin other parts of Canada. On Sundays her schoolhouse was filled\r\nto overflowing, many of her congregation coming five or six miles\r\nto get to the meeting. The Bible was read with eagerness by those\r\nwhose ignorance required prompting at every word. The oppression of\r\npast years was forgotten, for the hour, in the pleasure of learning\r\nto read the Word of God. An aged couple, past eighty, were among\r\nthe most regular attendants.[679] The spread of the earnest desire\r\nfor knowledge shown in these meetings would suffice to explain\r\nan observation made by Dr. Howe in 1863 to the effect that a\r\nsurprisingly large number could then read and write.[680]\r\n\r\n  [674] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, pp. 341, 342.\r\n\r\n  [675] _Ibid._, pp. 118, 147, 235.\r\n\r\n  [676] _Ibid._, p. 341.\r\n\r\n  [677] _Ibid._, p. 308.\r\n\r\n  [678] _First Annual Report of the Anti-Slavery Society of\r\n  Canada_, p. 15.\r\n\r\n  [679] _A Woman's Life Work_, pp. 192, 193.\r\n\r\n  [680] _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, p. 77.\r\n\r\nAn agency illustrative of the refugees' desire for self-improvement\r\nwas the association made up of local societies called \"True Bands.\"\r\nThe first of these clubs was organized at Amherstburg or Malden in\r\nSeptember, 1854, and in less than two years there were fourteen such\r\nsocieties in various parts of Canada West. The total membership of\r\nthe association is not known, but the True Band of Malden comprised\r\nsix hundred persons, and that of Chatham, on the first enrolment,\r\nthree hundred and seventy-five. Persons of both sexes were admitted\r\nto membership, and a small monthly payment was required. The objects\r\nof the association were comprehensive; they included the improvement\r\nof the schools, the increase of the school attendance among the\r\ncolored people, the abatement of race prejudice, the arbitration\r\nof disputes between colored persons, the employment of a fund for\r\naiding destitute persons just arriving from slavery, the suppression\r\nof begging in behalf of refugees by self-appointed agents, and\r\nso forth. The True Band at Malden did much good work; and in all\r\nother places where the societies were formed it is reported that\r\nexcellent results were secured. These clubs demonstrated their\r\nability by concerted action to care for numerous strangers as they\r\narrived in Canada after their long pilgrimage.[681]\r\n\r\n  [681] Drew, _A North-Side View of Slavery_, pp. 236, 237.\r\n\r\nAnother object of the True Band association was to prevent\r\ndivisions in the church, and as far as possible to heal those that\r\nhad already occurred. This provision was apparently intended to\r\nserve as a check on the disposition of the refugees to multiply\r\nchurches. \"Whenever there are a few families gathered together,\"\r\nwrote one observer, \"they split up into various sects and each\r\nsect must have a meeting-house of its own.... Their ministers have\r\ncanvassed the United States and England, contribution-box in hand;\r\nand by appealing to sectarian zeal, got the means of building up\r\ntabernacles of brick and wood, trusting to their own zeal for\r\ngathering a congregation....\"[682] This eagerness to build churches\r\nhas been criticised as consuming much of the time and substance of\r\nthe exiles, and causing division where union was desirable. But\r\nif this side of the religious life and activities of the refugees\r\ncalls for condemnation, another side, which was fostered by the\r\nnew conditions, was the more marked manifestation of the religious\r\nnature of the blacks in what has been well called in contrast with\r\ntheir emotionalism the higher forms of conscience, morality and good\r\nworks.[683]\r\n\r\n  [682] Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, p. 92.\r\n\r\n  [683] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nThe minds of many of the Canadian exiles were ever going back to the\r\nfriends and loved ones they had left behind them on the plantations\r\nof the South. Each new band of pilgrims as it came ashore at some\r\nCanadian port was scanned by little groups of negroes eagerly\r\nlooking for familiar faces. Strange and solemn reunions after years\r\nof separation and of hardship took place along the friendly shores\r\nof Canada. But the fugitive that was safe in the promised land was\r\nanxious to assist fortune, and as soon as he had learned to write or\r\ncould find an acquaintance to write for him, was likely to send a\r\nletter to some trusted agent of the Underground Railroad for advice\r\nor assistance in an attempt to release some slave or family of\r\nslaves from their thraldom. Many, we know, took a more dangerous\r\nmethod than this, and went personally to seek their relatives in\r\nthe South, and piloted them safely back to English soil; but the\r\nappeal to anti-slavery friends in the States, while probably less\r\neffective, sometimes secured the desired results. William Still,\r\nthe chairman of the Acting Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia,--a\r\nposition that brought him in contact with hundreds of escaped slaves\r\nas they were being sent beyond our northern frontier,--was the\r\nrecipient of numerous letters entreating his aid for the deliverance\r\nof the kinsmen of refugees.[684]\r\n\r\n  [684] Still, _Underground Railroad Records_, 2d ed., pp. 59, 65,\r\n  105, 137, 193, 249, 263, 291, 293, 337, 385, 448, 490.\r\n\r\nFugitive slaves were admitted to citizenship in the provinces on the\r\nsame terms as other immigrants. Many of them became property owners\r\nin the course of time, paid their allotted share of the taxes,\r\nand thus gained the franchise; Dr. Howe examined the records of\r\nseveral towns in 1862 and made comparisons of the amount of taxable\r\nproperty owned by whites and blacks. According to his statement the\r\nproportion of white rate or tax payers to the white population of\r\nMalden was in the ratio of one to three and one-third; that of the\r\ncolored ratepayers of the town to the colored population, one to\r\neleven. The average amount paid by the whites was $9.52, while that\r\npaid by the blacks was $5.12. In Chatham the white ratepayers were\r\n\"about one to every three and one-half of the white population,\r\nand the colored about one to every thirteen of the colored\r\npopulation.\" The average tax paid by white and black was $10.63\r\nand $4.98 respectively. At Windsor it appears that the proportion\r\nof ratepayers among the whites was as one to seven and one-fourth,\r\nand among the blacks it was as one to five. Here the per capita\r\naverage was $18.76 for the former, and $4.18 for the latter.[685]\r\nThese towns, it is to be noted, were not colonies; and in them the\r\nfugitives were offered no peculiar inducements to become the owners\r\nof property. All things considered, the showing is highly creditable\r\nfor the negroes.\r\n\r\n  [685] _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 61, 62.\r\n\r\nThe fact that they had been slaves did not debar the refugees\r\nfrom the exercise of whatever political rights they had acquired.\r\nThe negro voters used their privilege freely in common with the\r\nnative citizens, allying themselves with the two regular parties of\r\nCanada, the Conservative and the Reform.[686] In some communities\r\nnegroes were elected to office. The Rev. William King, head of the\r\nBuxton Settlement, has mentioned the offices of pathmasters, school\r\ntrustees, and councillors as those to which colored men were chosen\r\nwithin his knowledge. These, he said, were as high as the negro had\r\nthen attained, and he thought that white men would refuse to vote\r\nfor a black running for Parliament.[687] Dr. J. Wilson Moore, a\r\nfriend of the refugees, said of them in 1858 that their standing was\r\nfair, and that the laws of the land made no distinction. He observed\r\nthat they did jury duty with their white neighbors, and served as\r\nschool directors and road commissioners. On the whole, he thought,\r\nthey were as much respected as their intelligence and virtue\r\nentitled them to be.[688]\r\n\r\n  [686] Still, _Underground Railroad Records_, p. xxvii.\r\n\r\n  [687] Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, Appendix,\r\n  p. 108.\r\n\r\n  [688] Still, _Underground Railroad Records_, p. xvii.\r\n\r\nIn view of the remarkable progress made by the refugees and of\r\ntheir general serviceableness as settlers in the provinces, it\r\nis easy to understand why the Canadian government maintained its\r\nfavorable attitude towards them to the end of the long period of\r\nimmigration. In 1859 the Governor-General testified to the favorable\r\nopinion the central government entertained of the fugitives as\r\nsettlers and citizens by assuring the Rev. W. M. Mitchell that \"We\r\ncan still afford them homes in our dominions\"; and the Parliament\r\nof Ontario manifested its interest in their continued welfare\r\nby voting to incorporate the Association for the Education and\r\nElevation of the Colored People of Canada upon the showing that the\r\nassociation would thereby be enabled to extend its philanthropic\r\nlabors among the blacks.[689] The Canadian authorities seem to\r\nhave become established in the view reached after a candid and\r\nprolonged investigation by Dr. Howe, that the refugees \"promote the\r\nindustrial and material interests of the country and are valuable\r\ncitizens.\"[690]\r\n\r\n  [689] Mitchell, _The Underground Railroad_, pp. 155, 156.\r\n\r\n  [690] _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, p. 102. William\r\n  Still, who made a trip through Canada West in 1855, expressed a\r\n  view similar to that above quoted, and added the words: \"To say\r\n  that there are not those amongst the colored people in Canada,\r\n  as every place, who are very poor, ... who will commit crime,\r\n  who indulge in habits of indolence and intemperance, ... would\r\n  be far from the truth. Nevertheless, may not the same be said of\r\n  white people, even where they have had the best chances in every\r\n  particular?\" _Underground Railroad Records_, p. xxviii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVES IN BOSTON.\r\n\r\nThis church once stood near the house of Lewis Hayden, 66 Phillips\r\nStreet, Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n(From an old engraving.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFUGITIVE SETTLERS IN THE NORTHERN STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were many fugitives from bondage that did not avail themselves\r\nof the protection afforded by the proximity of Canadian soil. For\r\nvarious reasons these persons remained within the borders of the\r\nfree states; some were drawn by the affinities of race to seek\r\npermanent homes in communities of colored people; some, keeping\r\nthe stories of their past lives hidden, found employment as well\r\nas oblivion among the crowds in cities and towns; some, choosing\r\nlocalities more or less remote from large centres of population,\r\nsettled where the presence of Quakers, Wesleyan Methodists,\r\nCovenanters or Free Presbyterians gave them the assurance of safety\r\nand assistance; and some, after a severe experience of pioneer\r\nlife in the woods of Canada, preferred to run their chances on\r\nthe southern shores of the lakes, where it was easier to gain a\r\nlivelihood, and whence escape could be made across the line at the\r\nfirst intimation of danger.\r\n\r\nAs one would suppose, it is impossible to determine with any\r\naccuracy how many fugitive settlers there were in the North at any\r\nparticular time. Estimates both local and general in character\r\nhave come down to us, and, naturally enough, one is inclined to\r\nattach greater value to the former than to the latter, on the\r\nscore of probable correctness, but here the investigator is met\r\nby the extreme paucity of examples, which, as it happens, are\r\nconfined to two towns in eastern Massachusetts, namely, Boston and\r\nNew Bedford. In October, 1850, the Rev. Theodore Parker stated\r\npublicly that there were in Boston from four hundred to six hundred\r\nfugitives.[691] Concerning the refugee population of New Bedford\r\nour information is much less definite, for it is reported that\r\nin that place there were between six hundred and seven hundred\r\ncolored citizens, many of whom were fugitives.[692] Nevertheless one\r\ncannot doubt that the representatives of this class were numerous\r\nand widely scattered throughout the whole territory of the free\r\nzone, for reference is made by many surviving abolitionists not\r\nonly to individual refugees or single families of refugees that\r\ndwelt in their neighborhood, but even to settlements a considerable\r\npart of whose people were runaway slaves. Where conditions were\r\npeculiarly favorable it was not an unknown thing for runaways to\r\nconclude their journeys when scarcely more than within the borders\r\nof free territory. The Rev. Thomas C. Oliver, of Windsor, Canada,\r\nis authority for the statement that fugitive settlers swarmed among\r\ntheir Quaker protectors at Greenwich, New Jersey, on the very edge\r\nof a slave state.[693] In communities situated at greater distance\r\nfrom the sectional line, like Columbus[694] and Akron,[695] Ohio,\r\nElmira[696] and Buffalo,[697] New York, and Detroit, Michigan, many\r\nfugitives are known to have lived. The Rev. Calvin Fairbank relates\r\nthat, while visiting Detroit in 1849, he discovered several families\r\nhe had helped from slavery living near the city. He went to see\r\nthese families, and afterward wrote concerning them: \"Living near\r\nthe Johnsons, and like them contented and comfortable, I found the\r\nStewart and Coleman families, for whom I had also lighted the path\r\nof freedom.\"[698] In the vicinity of Sandy Lake, in the northwestern\r\npart of Pennsylvania, there was a colony of colored people, most of\r\nwhom were runaway slaves.[699]\r\n\r\n  [691] _Chronotype_, Oct. 7, 1850.\r\n\r\n  [692] Clipping from the _Commonwealth_, preserved in a scrap-book\r\n  relating to Theodore Parker, Boston Public Library.\r\n\r\n  [693] Conversation with Mr. Oliver, Windsor, Ont., Aug. 2, 1895.\r\n\r\n  [694] Conversation with the Rev.

The most indefinite of\r\nthese contemporary opinions is that of the veteran underground\r\nhelper, Samuel J. May, who states that \"hundreds ventured to\r\nremain this side of the Lakes.\"[700] Other judges attempt to put\r\ntheir estimates into figures; thus, Henry Wilson thinks that by\r\n1850 twenty thousand had found homes in the free states;[701] Mr.\r\nFranklin B. Sanborn, admitting the inherent difficulty of the\r\ncalculation, places the number at from twenty-five thousand to fifty\r\nthousand;[702] and the Canadian refugee, Josiah Henson, wrote in\r\n1852: \"It is estimated that the number of fugitive slaves in the\r\nvarious free states ... amounts to 50,000.\"[703]\r\n\r\n  [700] _Some Recollections of our Anti-Slavery Conflict_, p. 297.\r\n\r\n  [701] _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol. II, p. 304; see\r\n  also E.

Their reliance for safety was altogether\r\nupon their own wariness and the public sentiment of the communities\r\nwhere they lived, and until slavery perished in the Civil War they\r\nwere subjected to the fear of surprise and seizure. The Southern\r\npeople apparently regarded their right to recover their escaped\r\nslaves as unquestionable as their right to reclaim their strayed\r\ncattle, and they were determined to have the former as freely and\r\nfully recognized in the North as the latter;[704] and it might be\r\nadded that there were not a few people in the North quite willing to\r\nadmit the slaveholder's right freely to reclaim his human property,\r\nand to aid him in doing so. What the sentiment was that prevailed in\r\nthe North during the twenties and thirties of the present century is\r\nevidenced in certain laws enacted by the legislatures of some of the\r\nstates in line with the Federal Slave Law of 1793. Thus, in an act\r\npassed by the assembly of Pennsylvania, March 25, 1826, provision\r\nwas made for the issuance by courts of record of the commonwealth\r\nof certificates or warrants of removal for negroes or mulattoes,\r\nclaimed to be fugitives from labor;[705] and in a law enacted by\r\nthe legislature of Ohio, February 26, 1839, it was provided that\r\nany justice of the peace, judge of a court of record, or mayor\r\nshould authorize the arrest of a person claimed as a fugitive slave\r\non the affidavit of the claimant or his agent, and that the judge\r\nof a court of record before whom the fugitive was brought should\r\ngrant a certificate of removal upon the presentation of satisfactory\r\nproof.[706]\r\n\r\n  [704] James H.

Samuel J. May opens to\r\nview the convictions of some of the most cultured people of his day\r\nby the following incidents related concerning two well-known New\r\nEngland clergymen. \"The excellent Dr. E. S. Gannett, of Boston, was\r\nheard to say, more than once, very emphatically, and to justify it,\r\n'that he should feel it to be his duty to turn away from his door\r\na fugitive slave,--unfed, unaided in any way, rather than set at\r\nnaught the law of the land.'\r\n\r\n\"And Rev. Dr. Dewey, whom we accounted one of the ablest expounders\r\nand most eloquent defenders of our Unitarian faith,--Dr. Dewey was\r\nreported to have said at two different times, in public lectures\r\nor speeches during the fall of 1850 and the winter of 1851, that\r\n'he would send his _mother_ into slavery, rather than endanger\r\nthe Union, by resisting this law enacted by the constituted\r\ngovernment of the nation.' He has often denied that he spoke thus\r\nof his 'maternal relative,' and therefore I allow that he was\r\nmisunderstood. But he has repeatedly acknowledged that he did\r\nsay, 'I would consent that my own brother, my own son, should go,\r\n_ten times rather_ would I go myself into slavery, than that this\r\nUnion should be sacrificed.'\"[707] After the occurrence of the\r\nfamous Jerry rescue at Syracuse, October 1, 1851, many newspapers\r\nrepresenting both political parties emphatically condemned the\r\nsuccessful resistance made to the law by the abolitionists as \"a\r\ndisgraceful, demoralizing and alarming act.\"[708]\r\n\r\n  [707] _Some Recollections of our Anti-Slavery Conflict_, p. 367.\r\n\r\n  [708] _Some Recollections of Our Anti-Slavery Conflict_, p. 380.\r\n  The newspapers named by Mr. May are, _The Advertiser_ and _The\r\n  American_ of Rochester, _The Gazette_ and _Observer_ of Utica,\r\n  _The Oneida Whig_, _The Register_, _The Argus_ and _The Express_\r\n  of Albany, _The Courier_ and _Inquirer_ and _The Express_ of New\r\n  York.\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting in almost every community members of the\r\nshiftless class of society that were always ready to obstruct the\r\npassage of fugitive slaves to the North, and whose most vigorous\r\nexercise was taken in the course of some slave-hunting adventure.\r\nThe Rev. W. M. Mitchell, who had had this class to contend with in\r\nthe performance of his underground work during a number of years in\r\nOhio, characterized it in a description, penned in 1860, in which\r\nhe sets forth one of the conditions that made the Northern states\r\nan unsafe refuge for self-liberated negroes. \"The progress of the\r\nSlave,\" he wrote, \"is very much impeded by a class of men in the\r\nNorthern States who are too lazy to work at respectable occupations\r\nto obtain an honest living, but prefer to obtain it, if possible,\r\nwhether honestly or dishonestly, by tracking runaway slaves. On\r\nseeing advertisements in the newspapers of escaped slaves, with\r\nrewards offered, they, armed to the teeth, saunter in and through\r\nAbolition Communities or towns, where they are likely to find the\r\nobject of their pursuit. They sometimes watch the houses of known\r\nAbolitionists.... We are hereby warned, and for our own safety\r\nand that of the Slave, we act with excessive caution. The first\r\ndiscoverer of these bloody rebels communicates their presence to\r\nothers of our company, that the entire band in that locality is\r\nput on their guard. If the slave has not reached us, we are on the\r\nlookout, with greater anxiety than the hunters, for the fugitive,\r\nto prevent his falling into the possession of those demons in human\r\nshape. On the other hand should the Slave be so fortunate as to\r\nbe in our possession at the time, we are compelled to keep very\r\nquiet, until the hunter loses all hopes of finding him, therefore\r\ngives up the search as a bad job, or moves on to another Abolition\r\nCommunity, which gives us an opportunity of removing the Fugitive\r\nfurther from danger, or sending him towards the North Star....\"[709]\r\n\r\n  [709] _The Underground Railroad_, pp. 13, 14.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed, of course, that the business of\r\nslave-hunting was carried on mainly by the persons here described\r\nin such uncomplimentary terms. Persons of this type contented\r\nthemselves generally, no doubt, with acting as spies and informers,\r\nand rarely engaged in the excitement of a slave-hunt except as the\r\naids of Southern planters or their agents. If it is true that there\r\nwas a sentiment averse to slavery prevailing through many years in\r\nthe North, it is also true that the residents of the free states\r\nfor the most part conceded the right of Southerners to pursue and\r\nrecover their fugitives without hindrance from their Northern\r\nneighbors. The free states thus became what the abolitionists called\r\nthe \"hunting-ground\" of the South, and as early as 1830 or 1835\r\nthe pursuit of slaves began to attract wide attention. During the\r\nyears following many localities, especially in the middle states,\r\nwere visited from time to time by parties on the trail of the\r\nfleeing bondman, or seeking out the secluded home of some self-freed\r\nslave; and after the enactment of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850\r\nSoutherners became more energetic than before in pushing the search\r\nfor their escaped chattels. It has been recorded that \"more than two\r\nhundred arrests of persons claimed as fugitives were made from the\r\ntime of the passage of the Bill to the middle of 1856. About a dozen\r\nof these were free persons, who succeeded in establishing the claim\r\nthat they never had been slaves; other persons, equally free, were\r\ncarried off. Half a dozen rescues were made, and the rest of these\r\ncases were delivered to their owners. These arrests took place more\r\nfrequently in Pennsylvania than in any other Northern state. Many\r\nfugitives were caught and carried back, of whom we have no accounts,\r\nsave that they were seen on the deck of some river steamboat, in the\r\ncustody of their owners, without even passing through the formality\r\nof appearing before a commissioner. About two-thirds of the persons\r\narrested as above had trials. When the arrests to the number of two\r\nhundred, at least, can be traced, and their dates fixed, during six\r\nyears, we may suppose that the Bill was not, as some politicians\r\naverred, practically of little consequence.\"[710]\r\n\r\n  [710] Weiss, _Life and Correspondence of Theodore Parker_, Vol.\r\n  II, p. 93.\r\n\r\nConcerning the efficiency of the new law there is a difference of\r\nopinion among the contemporary writers that commented upon it;\r\nbut there could be no disagreement as to the distress into which\r\nit plunged some of the refugees long resident in the free states.\r\nIn not a few instances these persons had married, acquired homes,\r\nand were rearing their families in peace and happiness. Under the\r\nFugitive Slave Act some of these settlers were seized upon the\r\naffidavit of their former owners, and with the sanction of the\r\nfederal authority were carried back into slavery. Among the many\r\ncases that might be cited the following will serve to illustrate the\r\nmisfortunes ever ready to be precipitated upon fugitive settlers\r\nin the Northern states. In 1851 John Bolding, claimed as the\r\nproperty of a citizen of Columbia, South Carolina, was arrested in\r\nPoughkeepsie, New York, and taken back to the South. Bolding was a\r\nyoung man of good character, recently married, and the possessor\r\nof a small tailor shop in Poughkeepsie.[711] In August, 1853,\r\nGeorge Washington McQuerry, of Cincinnati, was remanded to slavery\r\nin Kentucky. He had lived several years in Ohio, had married a\r\nfree woman, and they had three children.[712] In September, 1853,\r\na family of colored persons at Uniontown, Pennsylvania, were\r\nclaimed as slaves by a Virginian. Their statement that they had\r\nbeen permitted by their master to visit friends in Fayette County\r\ndid not prevent their immediate restoration to him.[713] In May,\r\n1857, Addison White, a runaway from Kentucky, was found living\r\nnear Mechanicsburg, Ohio, where he had been at work about six\r\nmonths earning means to send for his wife and children. Some of the\r\nabolitionists of the neighborhood prevented his reclamation.[714]\r\nIn three of these cases at least the reënslavement of the refugees\r\nwas prevented by an abolition sentiment locally strong enough to\r\nlead to the purchase of the slaves from their claimants; but it is\r\nnoteworthy that public opinion in the neighborhoods where these\r\nrunaways lived was unable to shield them from capture.\r\n\r\n  [711] _The Fugitive Slave Law and Its Victims_, by Samuel May,\r\n  Jr., 1861, p. 19.\r\n\r\n  [712] _Ibid._, p. 31. See Appendix B, p. 374.\r\n\r\n  [713] _Ibid._, p. 68 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  [714] See Appendix B, p. 375.\r\n\r\nThe refugees that preferred to settle in the Northern states rather\r\nthan in Canada naturally made homes for themselves in anti-slavery\r\ncommunities among tried friends. Here they could rest with some\r\nassurance upon the benevolence of these localities and feel safe,\r\nalthough their liberty was still in danger. A slave-hunter in\r\nentering such neighborhoods was obliged to move with great caution;\r\nhe was in the midst of strangers, with few allies, and his scheme\r\nwas likely to fail if his presence became known. Sometimes, when\r\nhe was in the very act of leading the captive back to the South\r\nin bonds, he would find his progress interrupted by a crowd, his\r\nauthority questioned, his return to the office of a magistrate\r\ninsisted upon, and ultimately, perhaps, his prisoner released by a\r\nprocedure more or less formal. The slave-hunter that incautiously\r\nflourished weapons and made threats was likely to be arrested and\r\nsubjected to such additional delays and inconveniences as would\r\nrender his undertaking expensive as well as vexatious. There can\r\nbe no doubt that this was the experience of many slave-owners that\r\nsought to recover their servants in the free states. Mr. Clay\r\ntouched on this point, April 22, 1850, in presenting petitions to\r\nthe United States Senate from four citizens of Kentucky. These\r\npersons, he said, \"state that each of them has lost a slave.... That\r\nthese slaves have taken refuge in the state of Ohio, and that it is\r\nin vain for them to attempt to recapture them; that they cannot go\r\nthere and attempt to recover their property without imminent hazard\r\nto their lives.\"[715] This statement, reiterating the idea contained\r\nin the petitions themselves, namely, that the danger attending\r\npursuit was great, is too strong in reference to a large number of\r\nthe abolition communities in the Northern states, in many of which\r\nnon-resistance principles were advocated. At the same time it must\r\nbe remembered that the usual methods of slave-catchers were not\r\nconciliatory to the people among whom they went, and that their\r\nbravado sometimes secured for them rough treatment at the hands of\r\na mob, especially if the number of colored people present was large\r\nenough to warrant their venting their outraged feelings.\r\n\r\n  [715] _Congressional Globe_, New Series, Vol. XXII, Part I, p.\r\n  793.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of recovering slave property in the North had been\r\nconsiderable for some years, and it was steadily growing greater.\r\nThe uncertainty of reclamation in the large number of cases made\r\nthe whole business unprofitable and undesirable for slave-owners.\r\nA writer in the _North American Review_ for July, 1850, says,\r\n\"Though thousands of slaves have escaped by crossing the Ohio\r\nRiver, or Mason and Dixon's line, during the last five years, no\r\nattempt has been made to reclaim them in more than one case out of\r\na thousand.\"[716] If one takes this statement as meant to convey\r\nmerely the idea that the number of pursuits was extremely small in\r\nproportion to the number of escapes there will be no difficulty\r\nin accepting it, for probably this was the fact down to 1850; and\r\nthe explanation of it, so far as can be gathered from the lips of\r\nSouthern men, is to be found in the strong probability of failure in\r\nundertaking these costly enterprises. Thus Mr. Mason, of Virginia,\r\nin his argument in favor of a new fugitive slave law, declared that,\r\nunder the existing conditions, \"you may as well go down into the\r\nsea and endeavor to recover from his native element a fish which\r\nhas escaped from you, as expect to recover a ... fugitive. Every\r\ndifficulty is thrown in your way by the population.... There are\r\narmed mobs, rescues. This is the real state of things.\"[717]\r\n\r\n  [716] F. Bowen on \"Extradition of Fugitive Slaves,\" Vol. LXXI, p.\r\n  252 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  [717] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress, First\r\n  Session, p. 1583; also M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 31.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1850 was intended to remove the occasion for such\r\ncomplaints on the part of slaveholders, and secure them in the\r\nrecovery and possession of their property. The effect of its\r\nprovisions upon the South was to arouse slave-owners to greater\r\nactivity in the pursuit of their chattels, while in the North the\r\neffect was to increase greatly the determination in the minds of\r\nmany to resist the enforcement of the law. Despite the severe\r\npenalties it levelled against those that should be guilty of\r\nshielding the refugee, the expression of sympathy for fugitive\r\nsettlers was open and hearty in many quarters; and public meetings\r\nwere held by abolitionists to proclaim defiance to the law and\r\nprotection to the fugitive. At Lowell, Massachusetts, an immense\r\nFree Soil meeting adopted resolutions inviting former residents of\r\nthe city to return from Canada, where they had taken refuge;[718]\r\nat Syracuse, New York, a gathering of all parties declared its\r\nabhorrence of the Fugitive Slave Law, and formed an association or\r\nvigilance committee \"so that the Southern oppressors may know that\r\nthe people of Syracuse and its vicinity are prepared to sustain one\r\nanother in resisting the encroachments of despotism\";[719] at Boston\r\nan indignation meeting was held \"for the denunciation of the law and\r\nthe expression of sympathy and coöperation with the fugitive.\" Among\r\nthe resolutions adopted at this meeting, one advised \"the fugitive\r\nslaves and colored inhabitants of Boston and the neighborhood to\r\nremain with us, for we have not the smallest fear that any one of\r\nthem will be taken from us and carried off to bondage; and we trust\r\nthat such as have fled in fear will return to their business and\r\nhomes\"; another resolution proposed the appointment of a vigilance\r\ncommittee \"to secure the fugitives and colored inhabitants of\r\nBoston and vicinity from any invasion of their rights by persons\r\nacting under the law.\"[720] In Ashtabula County, Ohio, a meeting at\r\nHartsgrove resolved, \"that we hold the Fugitive Slave Law in utter\r\ncontempt ... and that we will not aid in catching the fugitive, but\r\nwill feed him, and protect him with all the means in our power, and\r\nthat we will pledge our sympathy and property for the relief of any\r\nperson in our midst who may suffer any penalties for an honorable\r\nopposition ... to the requirements of this law.\"[721] In other\r\nportions also of the free states meetings were held in which the\r\npurpose was avowed to protect fugitive slaves.[722]\r\n\r\n  [718] Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America_, Vol.\r\n  II, p. 306.\r\n\r\n  [719] Samuel J.

May, _Some Recollections of the Anti-Slavery Conflict_, p.\r\n  349.\r\n\r\nThe change of sentiment in the North from passive acquiescence in\r\nthe law to active resistance to it is best seen, perhaps, in the\r\nhistory of the so-called personal liberty laws. The real object of\r\nthese statutes was to impair the operation of the national Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, although their proposed object was in most cases to\r\nprevent the removal of free colored citizens to the South under\r\nthe claim that they were fugitive slaves. These statutes were\r\npassed by the legislatures of various states during the period of\r\na little more than thirty years from 1824 to 1858, the greater\r\nnumber being enacted after the repeal of the Missouri Compromise\r\nin 1854. The first two in the series were those enacted by Indiana\r\nand Connecticut in 1824 and 1838 respectively, and provided that on\r\nappeal fugitives might have a trial by jury. In 1840 Vermont and New\r\nYork framed laws granting jury trial, and also providing attorneys\r\nto defend fugitives. In 1842 the Prigg decision gave the occasion\r\nfor a new class of statutes; the release of state authorities\r\nfrom the execution of the Slave Law by the opinion handed down by\r\nJustice Story was taken advantage of in Massachusetts, Vermont,\r\nPennsylvania and Rhode Island, and the officers of the states were\r\nforbidden from performing the duties imposed by the law of 1793.\r\nThe decade from 1850 to 1860 is marked by a fresh crop of these\r\npersonal liberty acts, due to the sentiment aroused by the law of\r\n1850 and aggravated by the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. As the\r\nnew national law avoided the employment of state officers, state\r\nlegislation was now directed in the main to limiting the powers of\r\nthe executors of the laws as far as possible, and depriving them\r\nof the facilities of action. Thus, the new laws generally provided\r\ncounsel for any one arrested as a fugitive; secured to him a trial\r\nsurrounded by the usual safeguards; prohibited the use of state\r\njails; and forbade state officers to issue writs or give aid to the\r\nclaimant. The penalty for the violation of these provisions was a\r\nheavy fine and imprisonment. \"Such acts,\" it is said, \"were passed\r\nin Vermont, Connecticut and Rhode Island, in Massachusetts, Michigan\r\nand Maine. Later, laws were also enacted in Wisconsin, Kansas, Ohio\r\nand Pennsylvania. Of the other Northern States, two only, New Jersey\r\nand California, gave any official sanction to the rendition of\r\nfugitives. In New Hampshire, New York, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and\r\nMinnesota, however, no full personal liberty laws were passed.\"[723]\r\n\r\n  [723] M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, pp. 65-70, and the\r\n  references there given.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the disposition shown in many parts of the free\r\nstates to protect fugitive settlers, the Slave Law of 1850 spread\r\nconsternation and distress among them, and caused numbers to leave\r\nthe little homes they had established for themselves, and renew\r\ntheir search for liberty. Perhaps in no community of the North did\r\nfugitive settlers feel themselves more secure than in Boston, the\r\ncity of Garrison, Phillips and Parker; here they were gathered\r\ntogether by the Rev. Leonard B. Grimes, a colored man, who soon\r\norganized a church of fugitive slaves, and such was the feeling of\r\nconfidence among them that in 1849 a building was begun for this\r\nunique congregation. Within a few months, however, the new Slave\r\nLaw was enacted, and wrung from this band of runaways a cry of\r\nanguish that may be justly regarded as expressing the distress of\r\nthe people of this class in all quarters of the free states. At a\r\nmeeting of the Boston refugees, held October 5, 1850, an appeal to\r\nthe clergy of Massachusetts was issued, in the preamble of which\r\nwas embodied the slaves' view of their own situation, and their\r\npitiful entreaty for help. As \"trembling, proscribed and hunted\r\nfugitives ... now scattered through the various towns and villages\r\nof Massachusetts, and momentarily liable to be seized by the strong\r\narm of government, and hurried back to stripes, tortures and bondage\r\n...\" they implored the clergy to \"'lift up (their) voices like\r\na trumpet' against the Fugitive Slave Bill, recently adopted by\r\nCongress....\"[724] The church building of the fugitive settlers\r\n\"was arrested midway towards its completion, and the members were\r\nscattered in wild dismay. More than forty fled to Canada. One of\r\ntheir number, Shadrach, was seized, but more fortunate than the\r\nhapless Sims, who had no fellowship with them, he succeeded in\r\nmaking his escape.\"[725] An individual case that illustrates the\r\nsudden disaster experienced by numerous households throughout the\r\nNorth was recorded by the Rev. J. S. C. Abbott, in January, 1852.\r\nThe case occurred in Boston in 1851: \"A colored girl, eighteen years\r\nof age, a few years ago escaped from slavery at the South. Through\r\nscenes of adventure and peril she found her way to Boston, obtained\r\nemployment, secured friends, and became a consistent member of a\r\nMethodist church. She became interested in a very worthy young man,\r\nof her own complexion, who was a member of the same church. They\r\nwere soon married. Their home, though humble, was the abode of piety\r\nand contentment.... Seven years passed away; they had two little\r\nboys, one six and the other four years of age. These children, the\r\nsons of a free father, but of a mother who had been a slave, by the\r\nlaws of our Southern states were doomed to their mother's fate.\r\nThese Boston boys, born beneath the shadow of Faneuil Hall, the\r\nsons of a free citizen of Boston, and educated in the Boston free\r\nschools, were, by the compromises of the Constitution, admitted to\r\nbe slaves, the property of a South Carolinian planter. The Boston\r\nfather had no right to his own sons. The law, however, had long been\r\nconsidered a dead letter. The Christian mother, as she morning and\r\nevening bowed with her children in prayer, felt that they were safe\r\nfrom the slave-hunter, surrounded as they were by the churches, the\r\nschools, and the free institutions of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n  [724] Scrap-book of clippings, circulars, etc., presented to the\r\n  Boston Public Library by Mrs. L. L. Parker.\r\n\r\n  [725] C. E. Stevens, _Anthony Burns, A History_, 1856, p. 208.\r\n\r\n\"The Fugitive Slave Law was enacted. It revived the hopes of the\r\nslave-owners. A young, healthy, energetic mother, with two fine\r\nboys, was a rich prize.... Good men began to say: 'We must enforce\r\nthis law; it is one of the compromises of the Constitution.'\r\nChristian ministers began to preach: 'The voice of the law is the\r\nvoice of God. There is no higher rule of duty.'... The poor woman\r\nwas panic-stricken. Her friends gathered around her and trembled\r\nfor her. Her husband was absent from home, a seaman on board one\r\nof our Liverpool packets. She was afraid to get out of doors lest\r\nsome one from the South should see her and recognize her. One day,\r\nas she was going to the grocery for some provisions, her quick and\r\nanxious eye caught a glimpse of a man prowling around, whom she\r\nimmediately recognized as from the vicinity of her old home of\r\nslavery. Almost fainting with terror, she hastened home, and, taking\r\nher two children by the hand, fled to the house of a friend. She and\r\nher trembling children were hid in the garret. In less than one hour\r\nafter her escape, the officer with a writ came for her arrest.\r\n\r\n\"... At midnight, her friends took her in a hack, and conveyed her,\r\nwith her children, to the house of her pastor. A prayer-meeting\r\nhad been appointed there, at that hour, in behalf of the suffering\r\nsister. A small group of stricken hearts were assembled....\r\nGroanings and lamentations filled the room. No one could pray....\r\nOther fugitives were there, trembling in view of a doom more\r\ndreadful to them than death. After an hour of weeping ... they took\r\nthis Christian mother and her children in a hack, and conveyed them\r\nto one of the Cunard steamers, which fortunately was to sail for\r\nHalifax the next day.... Her brethren and sisters of the church\r\nraised a little money from their scanty means to pay her passage,\r\nand to save her for a few days from starving, after her first\r\narrival in the cold land of strangers. Her husband soon returned to\r\nBoston, to find his home desolate, his wife and his children exiles\r\nin a foreign land.\r\n\r\n\"I think that this narrative may be relied upon as accurate. I\r\nreceived the facts from the lips of one, a member of the church, who\r\nwas present at that midnight 'weeping-meeting,' before the Lord.\r\nSuch is slavery in Boston, in the year 1852. Has the North nothing\r\nto do with slavery?\"[726]\r\n\r\n  [726] Quoted by F. B. Sanborn, in his _Life of Dr. S. G. Howe,\r\n  the Philanthropist_, pp. 237, 238, 239.

Hopper_,\r\n  pp. 455-458.\r\n\r\nIn localities nearer to slave territory than Boston, and in places\r\nwhere anti-slavery sentiment was perhaps less pronounced, it may be\r\nsupposed that terror was not less prevalent among fugitive settlers.\r\nThe members of the colored community near Sandy Lake in northwestern\r\nPennsylvania, many of whom had purchased small farms and had them\r\npartly paid for, sold out or gave away their farms and went to\r\nCanada in a body.[727] The sudden disappearance of refugees from\r\ntheir habitations in various other places as soon as the character\r\nof the new law became noised abroad was a phenomenon the cause of\r\nwhich was unmistakable. Of the many that thus vanished from their\r\naccustomed haunts,[728] Josiah Henson, writing in 1852, said:\r\n\"Some have found their way to England, but the mass are flying to\r\nCanada, where they feel themselves secure. Already several thousands\r\nhave gone thither, and have added considerably to the number\r\nalready settled, or partially settled, in that part of the British\r\ndominions....\"[729] As Mr. Henson was a worker among the refugees in\r\nCanada he was in a position to speak from his personal knowledge,\r\nand his testimony is sustained by that of the Rev. Anthony Bingey,\r\nan escaped slave, who helped receive fugitives at Amherstburg,\r\nOntario, one of the chief landing-places of the negro emigrants from\r\nthe United States. Mr. Bingey states that after the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw took effect the runaways came there \"by fifties every day, like\r\nfrogs in Egypt.\" Before that time \"many had settled in the States,\r\nbut after the Fugitive Slave Law they could be taken, so they came\r\nin from all parts.\"[730] Sumner estimated that, altogether, \"as many\r\nas six thousand Christian men and women, meritorious persons,--_a\r\nlarger band than that of the escaping Puritans_,--precipitately\r\nfled from homes which they had established\" to British soil. _The\r\nLiberator_ published a statement, made in February, 1851, that the\r\nAfrican Methodist and Baptist churches of Buffalo, New York, had\r\nboth lost a large number of members, the loss of the former being\r\ngiven as one hundred. The Baptist church of the colored people of\r\nRochester, in the same state, out of a membership of one hundred and\r\nfourteen, lost one hundred and twelve, including the pastor. The\r\nAfrican Baptist church of Detroit lost eighty-four members at this\r\ntime.[731]\r\n\r\n  [727] Letter of John F. Hogue, Greenville, Pa., Nov. 25, 1895;\r\n  letter of the Rev.

No doubt a considerable\r\nnumber, more daring than the rest,[732] or in some way favored\r\nby circumstances, chose to remain and run the risk of discovery.\r\nColonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson asserts that \"For many years\r\nfugitive slaves came to Massachusetts and remained, this lasting\r\nuntil the Fugitive Slave Law was passed in 1850, and longer. Even\r\nafter that period we tried to keep them in Worcester, where I\r\nthen lived, it being a strong anti-slavery place, and they often\r\nstayed.\"[733] Some of the fugitives that were induced to move by\r\nthe Slave Law only passed from one state into another, instead of\r\ncontinuing their journey to regions beyond the jurisdiction of a\r\nUnited States commissioner. Of a company of blacks dwelling near\r\nthe home of Elijah F. Pennypacker in Chester County, Pennsylvania,\r\nat the time of the enactment of the law of 1850, it is said that\r\nwhile some went to Canada, some went to New York and some to\r\nMassachusetts.[734] It was noted above that the new church of the\r\nfugitives of Boston was stopped midway in the process of building\r\nby the promulgation of the act, but it is significant that the\r\nstructure was completed soon after. Evidently not all of the\r\nrefugees departed from the city of their adoption. It is related\r\nthat \"When the first fury of the storm had blown over, Mr. Grimes\r\nset himself with redoubled energy to repair the wastes that had\r\nbeen made. He collected money from the charitable, and purchased the\r\nmembers of his church out of slavery, that they might return without\r\nfear to the fold. He made friends among the rich, who advanced\r\nfunds for the completion of his church. At length it was finished,\r\nand, as if for an omen of good, was dedicated on the first day when\r\nBurns stood for trial before Commissioner Loring.\"[735] Runaways\r\nentering the free states for the first time after the subsidence\r\nof the paroxysm of fear among their fellows sometimes remained in\r\nneighborhoods where the conditions were supposed to be favorable to\r\ntheir safety. Some of these were never disturbed, and consequently\r\nnever went to Canada at all.\r\n\r\n  [732] \"Some of the boldest chose to remain, and armed themselves\r\n  to defend their freedom, instinctively calculating that the\r\n  sight of such an exigency would make the Northern heart beat\r\n  too rapidly for prudence!\" Weiss, _Life and Correspondence of\r\n  Theodore Parker_, Vol. II, p. 92.\r\n\r\n  [733] Letter of Mr. Higginson, Cambridge, Mass., Feb. 5, 1894.\r\n\r\n  [734] R.

In a\r\n  foot-note it is said, \"The church is a neat and commodious brick\r\n  structure, two stories in height, and handsomely finished in the\r\n  interior. It will seat five or six hundred people. The whole\r\n  cost, including the land, was $13,000, of which, through the\r\n  exertion of Mr. Grimes, $10,000 have already (1856) been paid....\"\r\n\r\nAmong the fugitive settlers in the Northern states there were\r\nsome at least that became widely known among abolitionists and\r\nothers as active agents of the Underground Railroad. Frederick\r\nDouglass was one of these, and during his residence in New Bedford,\r\nMassachusetts, and later during his residence in Rochester, New\r\nYork, he was able to help many runaways. The Rev. J. W. Loguen, who\r\nbecame a bishop of the African Methodist Church about 1869, settled\r\nin Syracuse, New York, in 1841, and became immediately one of the\r\nmanagers of secret operations there. In his hospitable home, Samuel\r\nJ. May relates, was fitted up an apartment for fugitive slaves,\r\nand, for years before the Emancipation Act, scarcely a week passed\r\nwithout some one, in his flight from slavedom to Canada, enjoyed\r\nshelter and repose at Elder Loguen's.\"[736] Lewis Hayden, for\r\nmany years a prominent citizen of Boston, who owed his liberty to\r\nthe self-sacrificing efforts of the Rev. Calvin Fairbank and Miss\r\nDelia Webster in September, 1844,[737] made a practice of harboring\r\nslaves in his house, number 66 Phillips Street. \"Some there are,\"\r\na recent writer declares, \"who well remember when William Craft was\r\nin hiding here from the slave-catchers, and how Lewis Hayden had\r\nplaced two kegs of gunpowder on the premises, resolved to blow up\r\nhis house rather than surrender the fugitive. The heroic frenzy of\r\nthe resolute black face, as with match in hand Hayden stood waiting\r\nthe man-stealers, those who saw it declare that they can never\r\nforget.\"[738]\r\n\r\n  [736] _Some Recollections of our Anti-Slavery Conflict_, pp. 202,\r\n  203.\r\n\r\n  [737] _Rev.

Grimké, on \"Anti-Slavery Boston,\" in _The\r\n  New England Magazine_, December, 1890, p. 458.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wells Brown, who distinguished himself as an anti-slavery\r\nlecturer in this country and England, rendered considerable service\r\nto fellow-fugitives shortly after his escape from Missouri about\r\n1840.[739] Securing employment on a Lake Erie steamboat, he was able\r\nto provide the means of transportation for many runaways across the\r\nlake. As the boat frequently touched at Cleveland on its trips to\r\nand fro between Buffalo and Detroit, Mr. Brown made an arrangement\r\nwith some Cleveland friends to furnish transportation, which was\r\ndone without charge, for any negroes they might wish to send to\r\nCanada. The result was that delegations of anxious refugees were\r\noften taken aboard at the Cleveland wharf. Brown engaged in this\r\nservice in the early forties, and his companies were therefore\r\nsmall, but he sometimes gave passage to four or five at one time.\r\n\"In the year 1842,\" he says, \"I conveyed, from the first of May\r\nto the first of December, sixty-nine fugitives over Lake Erie to\r\nCanada. In 1843 I visited Malden, in upper Canada, and counted\r\nseventeen in that small village whom I had assisted in reaching\r\nCanada.\"[740] John W. Jones, a respected citizen of Elmira, New\r\nYork, made his way in 1844 from Virginia to the city where he\r\nstill lives. During the following year he succeeded in aiding\r\ntwo younger brothers to join him, and thereafter he continued,\r\nin coöperation with Mr. Jervis Langdon and other abolitionists\r\nof Elmira, to succor his brethren in their search for places of\r\nrefuge. After the construction of the Northern Central Railroad\r\nthrough Elmira, Mr. Jones effected an arrangement with some of\r\nthe employees of that road by which his friends could be carried\r\nthrough to the Canadian border in baggage-cars. At the same time he\r\nwas in regular correspondence with William Still, the agent of the\r\ncentral underground station at Philadelphia, who frequently sent him\r\ncompanies of passengers requiring immediate transportation.[741]\r\nJohn H. Hooper, a fugitive from the Eastern Shore of Maryland and\r\nan acquaintance there of Fred Douglass, kept a station at Troy,\r\nNew York, where he settled.[742] Louis Washington, who fled from\r\nRichmond, Virginia, to Columbus, Ohio, became a conductor of the\r\nUnderground Road at that point. Mr. James Poindexter, a well-known\r\ncolored clergyman of Columbus, knew Washington intimately, and\r\ntestifies that he had teams and wagons with which he conveyed\r\nthe midnight pilgrims on their way.[743] There are other cases\r\nof fugitive settlers that became members of the large company of\r\nunderground operators. But a sufficient number have been mentioned\r\nto indicate that they were not rare. The first and the last of the\r\nseven named did not continue long in the status of escaped slaves.\r\nFrederick Douglass secured his liberty in a legal way through the\r\npayment by English friends of the sum of $750 to his master. Louis\r\nWashington purchased his own freedom. The other five, so far as\r\nknown, were never relieved by the payment of money from the claims\r\nof their masters. Most, if not all, of these men remained in the\r\nNorthern states after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.\r\n\r\n  [739] S. J.

At the end of March in the following\r\nyear a committee of the Senate was appointed to consider the\r\nmatter, but it accomplished nothing. At the beginning of the next\r\nsession a second Senate committee was chosen, and from this body\r\na bill emanated. This bill proved to be unsatisfactory, however,\r\nand after the committee had been remodelled by the addition of two\r\nnew members the bill was recommitted with instructions to amend.\r\nWith some slight change the measure proposed by the committee was\r\nadopted by the Senate, January 18; and after an interval of nearly\r\nthree weeks the House passed it with little or no debate, by a vote\r\nof forty-eight to seven. Thus for nearly a year and a quarter the\r\nsubject was under the consideration of Congress before it could be\r\nembodied in a bill and sent to the executive for his signature. On\r\nFebruary 12, 1793, President Washington signed this bill and it\r\nbecame a law.[744]\r\n\r\n  [744] M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, pp. 17, 18.\r\n\r\nThe object of the law was, of course, to enforce the constitutional\r\nguarantee in regard to the delivery of fugitives from service to\r\ntheir masters. An analysis of the law will show that forcible\r\nseizure of the alleged fugitive was authorized; that the decision of\r\nthe magistrate before whom he was to be taken was allowed to turn on\r\nthe testimony of the master, or the affidavit of some magistrate\r\nin the state from which he came; and that trial by jury was denied.\r\nPersons attempting to obstruct the law by harboring or concealing a\r\nfugitive slave, resisting his arrest, or securing his rescue, were\r\nliable to a fine of five hundred dollars for the benefit of the\r\nclaimant, and the right of action on account of these injuries was\r\nreserved to the claimant.[745]\r\n\r\n  [745] _Statutes at Large_, I, 302-305.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALMON P. CHASE, of OHIO,\r\n\r\nknown as \"attorney-general for fugitive slaves,\" on account of his\r\nfrequent appearance as counsel in fugitive slave cases.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS GARRETT, of WILMINGTON, DELAWARE,\r\n\r\nwho aided 2700 runaways, and paid $8000 in fines for his violations\r\nof the slave laws.]\r\n\r\nThe exclusive regard for the rights of the owner exhibited in these\r\nprovisions was fitted to stir the popular sense of justice in\r\nthe Northern states, most of which had already ranged themselves\r\nby individual action on the side of liberty. Persons moved by\r\nthe appeals of the hunted negro to transgress the statute would\r\nnaturally try to avoid its penalties by concealment of their acts,\r\nand this we know was what they did. The whole movement denominated\r\nthe Underground Railroad was carried on in secret, because only\r\nthus could the fugitives, in whose behalf it originated, and their\r\nabettors, by whom it was maintained, be secure from the law. When\r\nthrough mischance or open resistance, as sometimes happened, an\r\noffender against the law was discovered and brought to trial, the\r\ncase was not allowed to progress far before the Fugitive Recovery\r\nAct itself was assailed vigorously by the counsel for the defendant.\r\nThe grounds of attack included the absence of provision for jury\r\ntrial, the authority of the claimant or his agent to arrest without\r\na warrant, the antagonism between state and federal legislation, the\r\nsupposed repugnancy of the law of 1793 to the Ordinance of 1787,\r\nthe denial of the power of Congress to legislate on the subject of\r\nfugitive slaves, and the question as to the responsibility for the\r\nexecution of the law. Nearly if not all of these disputed points\r\nwere involved in the great question as to the constitutionality\r\nof the congressional act, a question that kept working up through\r\nthe successive decisions of the courts to irritate and disturb the\r\npeace between the sections, that the fugitive clause in the federal\r\nConstitution, the act of 1793 itself, and the judicial affirmations\r\nfollowing in their train were intended to promote.\r\n\r\nThe omission of a provision from the law of Congress securing trial\r\nby jury to the alleged fugitive was at once remarked by the friends\r\nof the bondman, and caused the law to be denounced in the court-room\r\nas worthy only of the severest condemnation.[746] As early as\r\n1819, in the case of Wright _vs._ Deacon, tried before the Supreme\r\nCourt of Pennsylvania, it was urged that the supposed fugitive was\r\nentitled to a jury trial, but the arguments made in support of the\r\nclaim have not been preserved.[747] The question was presented in\r\nseveral subsequent cases of importance arising under the law of\r\n1793, namely, Jack _vs._ Martin, in 1835,[748] Peter, _alias_ Lewis\r\nMartin, about 1837,[749] and State _vs._ Hoppess, in 1845.[750] From\r\nthe reports of these cases one is not able to gather much in the\r\nway of direct statement showing what were the grounds taken for\r\nthe advocacy of trial by jury in such cases, but the indications\r\nthat appear are not to be mistaken. In all of these cases it seems\r\nto have been insisted that the law of 1793 failed to conform to\r\nthe constitutional requirement on this point; and in State _vs._\r\nHoppess it is distinctly stated that the law provided for a trial of\r\nthe most important right without a jury, contrary to the amendment\r\nof the Constitution declaring that \"In suits at common law, where\r\nthe value shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury\r\nshall be preserved...\";[751] and that the act also authorized the\r\ndeprivation of a person of his or her liberty contrary to another\r\namendment, which declares that no person shall be \"deprived of life,\r\nliberty, or property, without due process of law.\"[752] In Jack\r\n_vs._ Martin, as probably in the other cases, the obvious objection\r\nseems to have been made that the denial of the jury contributed to\r\nmake easy the enslavement of free citizens. The courts, however, did\r\nnot sustain these objections; thus, for example, in the last case\r\nnamed, Judge Nelson, while admitting the defect of the law, decided\r\nin conformity with it,[753] and the claims upon the constitutional\r\nguarantees, asserted in behalf of the supposed fugitive, were also\r\noverruled, a reason given in the case of Wright _vs._ Deacon being\r\nthat the evident scope and tenor of both the Constitution and the\r\nact of Congress favored the delivery of the fugitive on a summary\r\nproceeding without the delay of a formal trial in a court of common\r\nlaw. Another reason offered by the court in this case, and repeated\r\nby the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District\r\nof New York in the matter of Peter, _alias_ Lewis Martin, was that\r\nthe examination under the federal slave law was only preliminary,\r\nits purpose being merely to determine the claimant's right to\r\ncarry the fugitive back to the state whence he had fled, where the\r\nquestion of slavery would properly be open to inquiry.\r\n\r\n  [746] Professor Eugene Wambaugh, of the Law School of Harvard\r\n  University, in a letter to the author, comments as follows on\r\n  the source of the injustice wrought by the Fugitive Slave acts:\r\n  \"The difficulty lay in the initial assumption that a human being\r\n  can be property. Grant this assumption, and there follow many\r\n  absurdities, among them the impossibility of framing a Fugitive\r\n  Slave Law that shall be both logical and humane. Human beings\r\n  are entitled to a trial of the normal sort, especially in a case\r\n  involving the liability of personal restraint. Chattels, however,\r\n  are entitled to no trial at all; and if a chattel be lost or\r\n  stolen, the owner may retake it wherever he finds it, provided he\r\n  commits no breach of the peace. (3 Blackstone's _Commentaries_,\r\n  4.) If slaves had been treated as ordinary chattels, there\r\n  could have been no trial as to the ownership of them, unless,\r\n  indeed, there were a dispute between competing claimants. There\r\n  would have been, however, the fatal objection that thus a free\r\n  man--black, mulatto, or white--might be enslaved without a\r\n  hearing. Here, then, is a puzzle. If the man is a slave, he\r\n  is entitled to no trial at all. If he is free, he is entitled\r\n  to a trial of the most careful sort, surrounded with all the\r\n  safeguards that have been thrown up by the law. When there is\r\n  such a dilemma, is it strange that there should be a compromise?\r\n  The Fugitive Slave Laws really were a compromise; for in so far\r\n  as they provided for an abnormal and incomplete trial, a hearing\r\n  before a United States Commissioner, simply to determine rights\r\n  as between the supposed slave and the supposed master, they\r\n  conceded the radical impossibility of following out logically\r\n  the supposition that human beings can be chattels, and, in so\r\n  far as they denied to the supposed slave the normal trial, they\r\n  assumed in advance that he was a slave. I need not write of the\r\n  dilemma further. A procedure intermediate between a formal trial\r\n  and a total denial of justice was probably the only solution\r\n  practicable in those days; but it was an illogical solution, and\r\n  the only logical solution was emancipation.\"\r\n\r\n  [747] 5 _Sergeant and Rawle's Reports_, 63.

The law empowered the claimant to seize the fugitive\r\nwheresoever found for the purpose of taking him before an officer\r\nto prove property. The circumstances that quickened the sympathy\r\nof a community into active resistance to this feature of the law\r\nare fully illustrated in one of the earliest cases coming before\r\na high court, in which the question of seizure was brought up for\r\ndetermination. The case is that of Commonwealth vs. Griffith, which\r\nwas tried in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, at the\r\nOctober term in 1823. From the record of the matter appearing in the\r\nlaw-books, one gathers that a slave, Randolph, who had fled from his\r\nmaster in Virginia, found a refuge in New Bedford about 1818, where\r\nby his thrift he acquired a dwelling-house. After several years\r\nhe was discovered by Griffith, his owner's agent, and was seized\r\nwithout a warrant or other legal process, although the agent had\r\ntaken the precaution to have a deputy sheriff present. The agent's\r\nintention was to take the slave before a magistrate for examination,\r\npursuant to the act of 1793.[754] New Bedford was a Quaker town,\r\nand the slave seems not to have lacked friends, for the agent was\r\nat once indicted for assault and battery and false imprisonment.\r\nThe action thus begun was prosecuted in the name of the state,\r\nunder the direction of Mr. Norton, the attorney-general. As against\r\nthe act of Congress the prosecution urged that the Constitution\r\ndid not authorize a seizure without some legal process, and that\r\nsuch a seizure would manifestly be contrary to the article of the\r\namendments of the Constitution that asserted the right of the people\r\nto be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures.[755] The protest that if the\r\nlaw was constitutional any citizen's house might be invaded without\r\na warrant under pretence that a negro was concealed there called\r\nforth the interesting remark from Chief Justice Parker that a case\r\narising out of a constable's entering a citizen's house without\r\nwarrant in search of a slave had come before him in Middlesex, and\r\nthat he had held the act to be a trespass. Nevertheless, the court\r\nsustained the law on the ground that slaves were not parties to the\r\nConstitution, and that the amendment referred to had relation only\r\nto the parties.[756]\r\n\r\n  [754] _2 Pickering's Reports_, 12. See Appendix B, p. 368.\r\n\r\n  [755] Amendments, Article IV; 2 _Pickering's Reports_, 15, 16.\r\n\r\n  [756] 2 _Pickering's Reports_, 19.\r\n\r\nThe question of arrest without warrant emerged later in several\r\nother cases; for example, Johnson vs. Tompkins (1833),[757] the\r\nmatter of Peter, _alias_ Lewis Martin (1837),[758] Prigg _vs._\r\nPennsylvania (1842),[759] and State _vs._ Hoppess (1845).[760] The\r\nline of objection followed by those opposing the law in this series\r\nwill be sufficiently indicated by the arguments presented in the\r\nMassachusetts case of 1823, treated above. The tribunals before\r\nwhich the later suits were brought did not depart from the precedent\r\nset in the early case, and the act of 1793 was invariably justified.\r\nIn Johnson _vs._ Tompkins the court pointed out that under the\r\nlaw the claimant was not only free to arrest his fugitive without\r\na warrant, but that he was also free to do this unaccompanied by\r\nany civil officer, although, as was suggested, it was the part of\r\nprudence to have such an officer to keep the peace.[761] In the\r\nfamous case of Prigg _vs._ Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States went back of the law of Congress to the Constitution\r\nin seeking the source of the master's right of recaption, and laid\r\ndown the principle that \"under and in virtue of the Constitution,\r\nthe owner of a slave is clothed with entire authority, in every\r\nstate in the Union, to seize and recapture his slave, whenever he\r\ncan do it without any breach of the peace, or any illegal violence.\r\nIn this sense and to this extent this clause of the Constitution\r\nmay properly be said to execute itself, and to require no aid from\r\nlegislation, state or national.\"[762]\r\n\r\n  [757] In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern\r\n  District of Pennsylvania. 1 _Baldwin's Circuit Court Reports_, p.\r\n  571 et seq.

This issue presented\r\nitself in at least three notable cases under the law of 1793: these\r\nwere Jack _vs._ Martin (1835), Peter, _alias_ Lewis Martin (1837),\r\nand Prigg _vs._ Pennsylvania (1842). The decisions reached in the\r\nfirst and last cases are of especial significance, because, in the\r\nfirst, the question of concurrent jurisdiction constituted the\r\nsubject of main interest for the Supreme Court of New York, the\r\ncourt to which the case had been taken from an inferior tribunal;\r\nwhile in the last case, the importance attaches to the conclusive\r\ncharacter of an adjudication pronounced by the most exalted court of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nIn Jack _vs._ Martin the action was begun under the New York\r\nlaw of 1828 for the recovery of a fugitive from New Orleans.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that this law authorized the seizure and\r\nreturn of fugitives to their owners, and that in the case before\r\nus, as occurred also in the case of Peter, _alias_ Lewis Martin,\r\nthe negro was adjudged to his claimant, the law of the state was\r\nconsidered invalid, because the right of legislation on the subject\r\nwas held to belong exclusively to the national government.[763]\r\n\r\n  [763] 12 _Wendell's Reports_, 311, 316-318.\r\n\r\nIn Prigg's case[764] a statute of Pennsylvania, passed in 1826,\r\nand bearing the suggestive title, \"An act to give effect to the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution of the United States relative to\r\nfugitives from labor, for the protection of free people of color,\r\nand to prevent kidnapping,\" was violated by Edward Prigg in seizing\r\nand removing a fugitive slave-woman and her children from York\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania, into Maryland, where their mistress lived.\r\nIn the argument made before the Supreme Court in support of the\r\nstate law, the authority of the state to legislate was urged on the\r\nground that such authority was not prohibited to the states nor\r\nexpressly granted \"in terms\" to Congress;[765] that the statute of\r\nPennsylvania had been enacted at the instance of Maryland, and with\r\na view to giving effect to the constitutional provision relative\r\nto fugitives;[766] that the states could best determine how the\r\nduty of delivery enjoined upon them should be performed so as to\r\nbe made acceptable to their citizens;[767] and that the act of\r\nCongress was silent as to the rights of negroes wrongfully seized\r\nand of the states whose territory was entered and laws violated\r\nby persons acting under pretext of right.[768] The Supreme Court\r\ndid not sustain these objections. A majority of the judges agreed\r\nwith Justice Story in the view that Congress alone had the power\r\nto legislate on the subject of fugitive slaves. The reasons given\r\nfor this view were two: first, the constitutional source of the\r\nauthority, by virtue of which the force of an act of Congress\r\npervades the whole Union uncontrolled by state sovereignty or state\r\nlaws, and secures rights that otherwise would rest upon interstate\r\ncomity and favor; and, secondly, the necessity of having a uniform\r\nsystem of regulations for all parts of the United States, by\r\nwhich the differences arising from the varieties of policy, local\r\nconvenience and local feelings existing in the various states can\r\nbe avoided. The right to retake fugitive slaves and the correlative\r\nduty to deliver them were to be \"coextensive and uniform in remedy\r\nand operation throughout the whole Union.\" While maintaining that\r\nthe right of legislation in this matter was exclusively vested in\r\nCongress, the court insisted that it did not thereby interfere with\r\nthe police power of the several states, and that by virtue of this\r\npower the states had the authority to arrest and imprison runaway\r\nslaves, and to expel them from their borders, just as they might do\r\nwith vagrants, provided that in exercising this jurisdiction the\r\nrights of owners to reclaim their slaves secured by the Constitution\r\nand the legislation of Congress were not impeded or destroyed.[769]\r\n\r\n  [764] See Appendix B, p. 370.\r\n\r\n  [765] 16 _Peters' Reports_, 579.\r\n\r\n  [766] _Ibid._, 588-590.\r\n\r\n  [767] _Ibid._, 595.\r\n\r\n  [768] _Ibid._, 602.\r\n\r\n  [769] _Ibid._, 612-617.\r\n\r\nAs the friends of runaway slaves sometimes sought to oppose to the\r\nsummary procedure of the federal law the processes provided by\r\nstate laws in behalf of fugitives, so in their endeavor to overthrow\r\nthe act of 1793, they occasionally appealed to the Ordinance for\r\nthe government of the Northwest Territory. The Ordinance, it will\r\nbe remembered, contained a clause prohibiting slavery throughout\r\nthe region northwest of the Ohio River, and another authorizing\r\nthe surrender of slaves escaping into this territory.[770] The\r\nabolitionists took advantage of these provisions under certain\r\ncircumstances, in the hope of securing the release of those that\r\nhad fallen into the eager grasp of the congressional act, and at\r\nthe same time of proving the incompatibility of this measure with\r\nthe Ordinance. The attempt to do these things was made in three\r\nwell-known cases, which came before the courts about 1845. The first\r\nof these was State _vs._ Hoppess, tried before the Supreme Court of\r\nOhio on the circuit, to secure the liberation of a slave that had\r\nfled from his keeper, but was afterwards recaptured;[771] the second\r\nwas Vaughan _vs._ Williams, adjudicated in the Circuit Court of the\r\nUnited States for the District of Indiana, a case originating in an\r\naction against the defendant for rescuing certain fugitives;[772]\r\nand the third was Jones _vs._ Van Zandt, which was carried to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States and there decided. This last case\r\ngrew out of the aid given nine runaways by Mr. Van Zandt, through\r\nwhich one of them succeeded in escaping.[773] The arguments, based\r\nupon the Ordinance, that were advanced in these cases are adequately\r\nset forth in the report of the first case, a report prepared by\r\nSalmon P. Chase, subsequently Chief Justice of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States. These arguments, two in number, were as\r\nfollows: first, the Ordinance expressly prohibited slavery, and\r\nthereby effected the immediate emancipation of all slaves in the\r\nTerritory; and, secondly, the clause in the Ordinance providing for\r\nthe surrender of fugitives applied only to persons held to service\r\nin the _original_ states.[774]\r\n\r\n  [770] See Chap. II, pp. 28, 32.\r\n\r\n  [771] 2 _Western Law Journal_, 279-293.\r\n\r\n  [772] 3 _Western Law Journal_, 65-71; also, 3 _McLean's Reports_,\r\n  530-538.\r\n\r\n  [773] 5 _Howard's Reports_, 215 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  [774] 2 _Western Law Journal_, 281, 283; 3 _McLean_, 530.\r\n\r\nThe opinions given by the courts in the cases under consideration\r\nfailed to support the idea of the irreconcilability existing between\r\nthe law of 1793 and the Ordinance. The Supreme Court of Ohio\r\ndeclared that under the federal Constitution the right of recaption\r\nof fugitive slaves was secured to the new states to the same extent\r\nthat it belonged to the original states.[775] The Circuit Court of\r\nthe United States took virtually the same stand by pointing out\r\nthat a state carved from the Northwest Territory assumed the same\r\nconstitutional obligations by entering the Union that the original\r\nthirteen states had earlier assumed, and that where a conflict\r\noccurred the Constitution was paramount to the Ordinance.[776]\r\nFinally, the Supreme Court at Washington declared that the clause\r\nin the Ordinance prohibiting slavery applied only to people living\r\nwithin the borders of the Northwest Territory, and that it did not\r\nimpair the rights of those living in states outside of this domain.\r\nWheresoever the Ordinance existed the states preserved their own\r\nlaws, as well as the Ordinance, by forbidding slavery; the provision\r\nof the Constitution and the act of Congress looking toward the\r\ndelivery of fugitive slaves did not interfere with the laws of the\r\nfree states as to their own subjects. The court therefore held that\r\nthere was no repugnance between the act and the Ordinance.[777]\r\n\r\n  [775] 2 _Western Law Journal_, 288.\r\n\r\n  [776] 3 _McLean's Reports_, 532; 3 _Western Law Journal_, 65.\r\n\r\n  [777] 5 _Howard's Reports_, 230, 231.\r\n\r\nAmong the various objections raised in the court-room against the\r\nlaw of 1793, the denial of the power of Congress to legislate on the\r\nsubject of fugitive slaves was one that should not be overlooked.\r\nIt commanded the attention of the bench in at least two important\r\ncases, both of which have been mentioned in other connections,\r\nnamely, Peter, _alias_ Lewis Martin (1837), and State _vs._ Hoppess\r\n(1845). In both of these cases the denial of legislative authority\r\nwas based upon the doctrine that there had been no delegation of the\r\nnecessary power to Congress by the Constitution. The fugitive slave\r\nclause in the Constitution, it was said in the report of the second\r\ncase, prepared by Mr. Chase, granted no power at all to Congress,\r\nbut was \"a mere clause of compact imposing a duty on the states\r\nto be fulfilled, if at all, by state legislation.\"[778] However\r\nprevalent this view may have been in the Northern states,--and the\r\nnumber of state laws dealing with the subject of fugitive slaves\r\nindicates that it predominated,--neither the Circuit Court of the\r\nUnited States for the Southern District of New York in the earlier\r\ncase, nor the Supreme Court of Ohio in the later, were willing\r\nto subscribe to the doctrine. On the contrary, both asserted the\r\npower of Congress to pass laws for the restoration of runaway\r\nslaves, on the ground that the creation of a duty or a right by the\r\nConstitution is the warrant under which Congress necessarily acts in\r\nmaking the laws needful to enforce the duty or secure the right.[779]\r\n\r\n  [778] 2 _Paine's Reports_, 354; 2 _Western Law Journal_, 282.\r\n\r\n  [779] 2 _Paine's Reports_, 354, 355; also, 2 _Western Law\r\n  Journal_, 289.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the judicial examination in the high courts of\r\nthe various points thus far considered was wholly favorable to\r\nthe constitutionality of the law of 1793. The one case within\r\nthe category of great cases in which that law was decided to\r\nbe unconstitutional in any particular was that of Prigg _vs._\r\nPennsylvania. By the law of 1793 state and local authorities\r\nwere empowered to take cognizance of fugitive slave cases\r\ntogether with judges holding their appointments from the federal\r\ngovernment.[780] In the hearing given the case before the Supreme\r\nCourt at Washington, in 1842, Mr. Johnson, the attorney-general of\r\nPennsylvania, cited former decisions of the Supreme Court to show\r\nthat in so far as the congressional law vested jurisdiction in\r\nstate officers it was unconstitutional and void.[781] The court's\r\nanswer was momentous and far-reaching. While the law was declared\r\nto be constitutional in its essential features, it was asserted\r\nthat it did not point out any state functionaries, or any state\r\nactions, to carry its provisions into effect. The states could not,\r\ntherefore, so the court decided, be compelled to enforce them;\r\nand any insistence that the states were bound to provide means\r\nfor the performance of the duties of the national government,\r\nnowhere delegated or entrusted to them by the Constitution,\r\nwould bear the appearance of an unconstitutional exercise of the\r\ninterpretative power.[782] As the decision in the Prigg case\r\ncarried the weight of great authority, and became a precedent for\r\nall future judgments,[783] the relief it afforded state officers\r\nfrom distasteful functions was soon accepted by many states, and\r\nthey enacted laws forbidding their magistrates to issue warrants\r\nfor the arrest or removal of fugitive slaves.[784] In consequence\r\nof this manifest disinclination on the part of the Northern states\r\nto restore to Southern masters their escaped slaves, the federal\r\ngovernment was induced to make more effective provision for the\r\nexecution of the Constitution in this particular. Such provision was\r\nembodied in the second Fugitive Slave Law, passed as a part of the\r\nCompromise of 1850.\r\n\r\n  [780] See Section 3 of the act, _Statutes at Large_, I, 302-305.\r\n\r\n  [781] 16 _Peters' Reports_, 598.\r\n\r\n  [782] _16 Peters' Reports_, 608, 622. See also Marion G.\r\n  McDougall's _Fugitive Slaves_, pp. 108, 109.\r\n\r\n  [783] M. G. McDougall's _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 28.\r\n\r\n  [784] See Chap. IX, pp. 245, 246, and Chap. X, p. 337.\r\n\r\nThat the new law was not intended to extinguish the old is apparent\r\nfrom the title assigned it, which read: \"An Act to amend, and\r\nsupplementary to, the Act entitled 'An Act respecting Fugitives\r\nfrom Justice, and Persons escaping from the service of their\r\nMasters, ...\"[785] Its evident purpose was to increase the facilities\r\nand improve the means for the recovery of fugitives from labor.\r\nTo this end it created commissioners, who were to have authority,\r\nlike the judges of the circuit and district courts of the United\r\nStates, to issue warrants for the apprehension of runaway slaves,\r\nand to grant certificates for the removal of such persons back to\r\nthe state or territory whence they had escaped. All cases were to\r\nbe heard in a summary manner; the testimony of the alleged fugitive\r\ncould not be received in evidence; and the fee of the commissioner\r\nor judge was to be ten dollars when the decision was in favor of\r\nthe claimant, but only five dollars when it was unfavorable. The\r\npenalties created by the new law were more rigorous than those\r\nimposed by the old. A fine not to exceed a thousand dollars and\r\nimprisonment not to exceed six months constituted the punishment\r\nfor harboring a runaway or aiding in his rescue, and the party\r\ninjured could bring suit for civil damages against the offender in\r\nthe sum of one thousand dollars for each fugitive lost through his\r\ninterference. If the claimant apprehended a rescue, the officer\r\nmaking the arrest could be required to retain the fugitive in his\r\ncustody for the purpose of removing him to the state whence he had\r\nfled. The refusal of the officer to obey and execute the warrants\r\nand precepts issued under the provisions of the law laid him liable\r\nto a fine of a thousand dollars for the benefit of the claimant;\r\nand the escape of a fugitive from his custody, whether with his\r\nassent or without it, made him liable to a prosecution for the\r\nfull value of the labor of the negro thus lost. Ample security\r\nfrom such disaster was intended to be provided for the marshal and\r\nhis deputies by the clause authorizing them to summon to their aid\r\nthe bystanders, or posse comitatus, when necessary, and all good\r\ncitizens were commanded to respond promptly with their assistance.\r\nIn removing a fugitive back to the state from which he had escaped,\r\nwhen an attempt at rescue was feared, the marshal in charge was\r\ncommanded to employ as many persons as he deemed necessary to\r\nresist the interference. The omission of the new law to mention any\r\nofficers appointed by the states is doubtless traceable, as is the\r\nclause establishing commissionerships, to the ruling in the decision\r\nof Prigg's case that state officers could not be forced to execute\r\nfederal legislation.\r\n\r\n  [785] _Statutes at Large_, IX, 462.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the decision in the Prigg case also\r\ncontained a ruling that acknowledged the right of the claimant to\r\nseize and remove the alleged fugitive, wheresoever found, without\r\njudicial process. It has been suggested recently that this part of\r\nthe decision, denominated the most obnoxious part, was avoided in\r\nthe law of 1850.[786] But the language of the new law no more denied\r\nthis right than the language of the old bestowed it. In both cases\r\nequally the claimant seems to have enjoyed the right of private\r\nseizure and arrest without process, but for the purpose of taking\r\nthe supposed fugitive before the proper official.[787] So far as\r\nthe language of the statute was concerned the Prigg decision was\r\nquite as possible under the later as under the earlier law. It was\r\nthe language of the Constitution upon which this part of the famous\r\ndecision was made to rest, and that, it needs scarcely be said,\r\ncontinued unchanged during the period with which we are concerned.\r\n\r\n  [786] Henry W. Rogers, Editor, _Constitutional History of the\r\n  United States as seen in the Development of American Law_,\r\n  Lecture III, by George W. Biddle, p. 152.\r\n\r\n  [787] Section 3 of the law of 1793 provided that \"the person to\r\n  whom such labour or service may be due, his agent or attorney,\r\n  is hereby empowered to seize and arrest such fugitive from\r\n  labour, and to take him or her before any judge of the circuit\r\n  or district courts of the United States, ... within the state,\r\n  or before any magistrate of a county (etc.) ... wherein such\r\n  seizure ... shall be made, and upon proof to the satisfaction of\r\n  such judge or magistrate ... it shall be the duty of such judge\r\n  or magistrate to give a certificate thereof ... which shall be\r\n  a sufficient warrant for removing the said fugitive ... to the\r\n  state or territory from which he or she fled.\"\r\n\r\n  Section 6 of the act of 1850 provides that \"the person or persons\r\n  to whom such service or labour may be due, or his, her, or their\r\n  agent or attorney ... may pursue and reclaim such fugitive\r\n  person, either by procuring a warrant ... or by seizing and\r\n  arresting such fugitive, where the same can be done without\r\n  process, and by taking, or causing such person to be taken,\r\n  forthwith before such court, judge or commissioner, whose duty\r\n  it shall be to hear and determine the case ... in a summary\r\n  manner; and upon satisfactory proof ... to make out and deliver\r\n  to such claimant, his or her agent or attorney, a certificate\r\n  ... with authority ... to use such reasonable force ... as may\r\n  be necessary ... to take and remove such fugitive person back\r\n  to the State or Territory whence he or she may have escaped as\r\n  aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed, of course, that the law of 1850 was found\r\nto be intrinsically less objectionable to abolitionists than the\r\nmeasure it was intended to supplement. On the contrary, it soon\r\nproved to be decidedly more objectionable. The features of the\r\nfirst Slave Act that were obnoxious to the Northern people, and had\r\nbeen subjected to examination in the courts, were retained in the\r\nsecond act, where they were associated with a number of new features\r\nof such a character that they soon brought the new law into the\r\ngreatest contempt. While, therefore, the records of the trials of\r\nthe chief cases arising under the later law are found to contain\r\narguments borrowed from the contentions made in the cases already\r\ndiscussed, it is interesting to note that they afford proof that\r\nnew arguments were also brought to bear against the act of 1850.\r\nAs with the first Fugitive Slave Law, so also with its successor,\r\nfault was found on account of the absence of any provision for jury\r\ntrial;[788] the authority of a claimant or his agent to arrest\r\nwithout legal process;[789] the opposition alleged to exist between\r\nthe law and the Ordinance of 1787;[790] and the power said to be\r\nimproperly exercised by Congress in legislating upon the subject\r\nof fugitive slaves.[791] It is unnecessary to introduce here a\r\nstudy of these points as they presented themselves in the various\r\ncases arising, for a discussion of them would lead to no principles\r\nof importance other than those discovered in the cases already\r\nexamined.[792]\r\n\r\n  [788] Sims' case, tried before the Supreme Judicial Court of\r\n  Massachusetts, March term, 1851.

Booth's case.\r\n  See 3 _Wisconsin Reports_.\r\n\r\n  [792] For the text of the Slave Laws, see Appendix A, pp. 359-366.\r\n\r\nIn some of the cases that were tried under the act of 1850, however,\r\nnew questions appeared; and in some, where the questions were\r\nperhaps without novelty, the circumstances were such that the cases\r\ncannot well be passed over in silence.\r\n\r\nIf, as was freely declared by the abolitionists, it was possible\r\nfor free negroes to be abducted from the Northern states under the\r\nform of procedure laid down by the act of 1793, there can be little\r\nreason to doubt that the same thing was equally possible under the\r\nprocedure established by the act of 1850. Certain it is that the\r\nanti-slavery people were not dubious on this point, but they had\r\nscarcely had time to formulate their criticisms of the new law when\r\nthe first case under it of which there is any record demonstrated\r\nthe ease with which this legislation could be taken advantage of\r\nin the commission of a foul injustice. The case occurred September\r\n26, only eight days after the passage of the act. A free negro,\r\nJames Hamlet, then living in New York, was arrested as the slave of\r\nMary Brown, of Baltimore. The hearing took place before a United\r\nStates commissioner and the negro's removal followed at once. The\r\ncommunity in which Hamlet was living was greatly incensed when the\r\nfacts concerning his disappearance became known, and the sum of\r\nmoney necessary for his redemption was quickly contributed. Before a\r\nfortnight had elapsed he was brought back from slavery.[793]\r\n\r\n  [793] Marion G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, pp. 43 and 44, with\r\n  the references there given; Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave\r\n  Power_, Vol. II, pp. 304, 305. See Appendix B, p. 372.\r\n\r\nThe summary manner in which this case was disposed of had prevented\r\na defence being made in behalf of the supposed fugitive. In the\r\nnext case, however, that of Thomas Sims, which was tried before\r\nthe Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1851, the negro was\r\nrepresented by competent counsel, who brought forward objections\r\nagainst the second Fugitive Slave Law. Almost the first of these\r\nwas directed against the power of the special officers, the\r\ncommissioners, created by the new law. It was insisted that the\r\nauthority with which these officers were invested was distinctly\r\njudicial in character, despite the constitutional provision limiting\r\nthe exercise of the judicial power of the United States to organized\r\ncourts of justice, composed of judges, holding their offices during\r\ngood behavior, and receiving fixed salaries for their services.[794]\r\nThe same argument seems to have been adduced in Scott's case, tried\r\nbefore the District Court of the United States in Massachusetts\r\nin 1851; in the case of Miller _vs._ McQuerry, tried before the\r\nCircuit Court of the United States in Ohio in 1853;[795] in Booth's\r\ncase, argued in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in 1854;[796] in the\r\ncase known as _ex parte_ Robinson, adjudicated by the Circuit Court\r\nof the United States for the Southern District of Ohio at its April\r\nterm, 1855;[797] and in the case _ex parte_ Simeon Bushnell, argued\r\nand determined in the Supreme Court of Ohio in 1859.[798] The court\r\nmet this argument by a direct answer in four of the cases mentioned,\r\nnamely, those of Sims, Scott, Booth and _ex parte_ Robinson. In the\r\nfirst, Sims' case, Chief Justice Shaw pointed out that under the\r\nSlave Law of 1793 the jurisdiction over fugitive slave cases had\r\nbeen conferred on justices of the peace and magistrates of cities\r\nand towns corporate, as well as on judges of the United States\r\ncircuit and district courts, and that evidently, therefore, the\r\npower bestowed had not been deemed judicial in the sense in which\r\nit was urged that the functions of the commissioners were judicial.\r\nAt the same time the judge admitted that the \"argument from the\r\nlimitation of judicial power would be entitled to very grave\r\nconsideration\" if it were without the support of early construction,\r\njudicial precedent and the acquiescence of the general and state\r\ngovernments. In the trial of James Scott, on the charge of aiding\r\nin the rescue of Shadrach (May or June, 1851), Judge Sprague, of\r\nthe United States District Court, held that the legal force of the\r\ncertificate issued by a commissioner lay merely in the authority it\r\nconveyed to remove the person designated from one state to another,\r\nand that the disposition made of the person removed depended solely\r\nupon the laws of the state to which he was taken. The facts set\r\ndown in the certificate were not, therefore, to be considered as\r\nmatters judicially established, but as facts only in the opinion of\r\nthe commissioner. In Booth's case, the opinion of the Supreme Court\r\nof Wisconsin contained a reference to the legality of the power of\r\nthe commissioners and sustained the objection to their authority\r\non the ground of unconstitutionality.[799] In _ex parte_ Robinson,\r\nJudge McLean admitted that the inquiry made by the commissioner\r\nwas \"somewhat in the nature of judicial power,\" but that the same\r\nremark applied to all the officers of the accounting departments of\r\nthe government, as, for example, the examiners in the Patent Office.\r\nHe also remarked that the Supreme Court had always treated the acts\r\nof the commissioners, in the cases that had come before it, as\r\npossessed of authority under the law.[800]\r\n\r\n  [794] _7 Cushing's Reports_, 287. The constitutional requirement\r\n  will be found in Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution of\r\n  the United States.\r\n\r\n  [795] 5 _McLean's Reports_, 481.\r\n\r\n  [796] 3 _Wisconsin Reports_, 39.\r\n\r\n  [797] 6 _McLean's Reports_, 359.\r\n\r\n  [798] 9 _Ohio State Reports_, 176.\r\n\r\n  [799] 3 _Wisconsin Reports_, 64.\r\n\r\n  [800] 6 _McLean's Reports_, 359, 360.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty as to the precise character of the commissioners'\r\npower displayed in the different views of the courts before which\r\nthe question was brought marks the observations of the commissioners\r\nthemselves in regard to their authority. Examples will be found\r\nin Sims' and Burns' cases. In the former, Mr. George T. Curtis\r\ndeclared that claims for fugitive slaves came within the judicial\r\npower of the federal government, and that, consequently, the mode\r\nand means of the application of this power to the cases arising were\r\nproperly to be determined by Congress. In the latter, Mr. Edward G.\r\nLoring asserted that his action was not judicial at all, but only\r\nministerial.\r\n\r\nAn additional ground of objection to the commissioners was found in\r\nthe provision made in the law of 1850 for their remuneration. When\r\none of these officers issued a certificate authorizing the removal\r\nof a runaway to the state whence he had escaped, he was legally\r\nentitled to a fee of ten dollars; when, however, he withheld the\r\nwarrant he could receive but five dollars. Abolitionists took much\r\noffence at this arrangement, and sometimes scornfully denominated\r\nthe special appointees under the law the \"ten-dollar commissioners,\"\r\nand insisted that the difference between the fees was in the nature\r\nof a bribe held out to the officers to induce them to decide in\r\nfavor of the claimant. Considering the prevalence of this feeling\r\noutside of the courts, it is not surprising that objections to the\r\nsection of the act regulating the fees of commissioners should\r\nhave been taken within the court-room.[801] Such objection was\r\nraised in McQuerry's case, and was answered by Judge McLean. This\r\nanswer is probably the only one judicially declared, and is worth\r\nquoting: \"In regard to the five dollars, in addition, paid to the\r\ncommissioner, where the fugitive is remanded to the claimant,\" the\r\njudge explained, \"in all fairness it cannot be considered as a\r\nbribe, or as so intended by Congress; but as a compensation to the\r\ncommissioner for making a statement of the case, which includes the\r\nfacts proved, and to which the certificate is annexed. In cases\r\nwhere the witnesses are numerous and the investigation takes up\r\nseveral days, five dollars would scarcely be a compensation for the\r\nstatement required. Where the fugitive is discharged, no statement\r\nis necessary.\"[802]\r\n\r\n  [801] Hurd, _Law of Freedom and Bondage_, Vol. II, p. 747.\r\n\r\n  [802] 5 _McLean's Reports_, 481.\r\n\r\nThe fees paid to commissioners were, as indicated in the remarks\r\njust quoted, by way of remuneration for services rendered in\r\ninquiries relative to the rights of ownership of negroes alleged to\r\nhave escaped from the South. These inquiries, together with similar\r\ninquiries that arose under the act of 1793, constitute a group by\r\nthemselves. Another group is made up of the cases growing out of the\r\nprosecution under the two acts of persons charged with harboring\r\nfugitive slaves, or aiding in their rescue. The secrecy observed by\r\nabolitionists in giving assistance to escaping bondmen shows that\r\nthe evils threatening, if a discovery occurred, were constantly kept\r\nin mind. After the passage of the second act, public denunciation\r\nof the measure was indulged in freely, and open resistance to its\r\nprovisions, whether these should be considered constitutional or\r\nnot, was recommended in some quarters. Such remonstrances seem to\r\nhave early disturbed the judicial repose of the courts, for, six\r\nmonths after the new Fugitive Slave Bill had become a law, Justice\r\nNelson found occasion in the course of a charge to the grand jury of\r\nthe Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of\r\nNew York to deliver a speech on sectional issues in which he gave\r\nan exposition of the new law, \"so that those, if any there be, who\r\nhave made up their minds to disobey it, may be fully apprised of the\r\nconsequences.\"[803] The severer penalties of the law of 1850 had\r\nno deterrent effect upon those who were determined to resist its\r\nenforcement. The fervor displayed in harboring runaways increased\r\nrather than diminished throughout the free states, and the spirit\r\nof resistance thus fostered broke out in daring and sometimes\r\nsuccessful attempts at rescue. Through the activity of slave-owners\r\nin seeking the recovery of their lost property, and the support\r\nafforded them by the government in the strict enforcement of the new\r\nlaw, a number of offenders were brought to trial and subjected to\r\npunishments inflicted under its provisions.\r\n\r\n  [803] 1 _Blatchford's Circuit Court Reports_, 636.\r\n\r\nAmong the prosecutions arising under the two congressional acts the\r\nfollowing cases are offered as typical. The number has been limited\r\nby choosing in general from among such as came before supreme courts\r\nof the states, or before circuit and district courts of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest cases of which we have record was brought\r\nbefore the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern\r\nDistrict of Pennsylvania on writ of error, in 1822. The action\r\nwas for the penalty under the law of 1793 for obstructing the\r\nplaintiff, a citizen of Maryland, in seizing his escaped slave in\r\nPhiladelphia for the purpose of taking him before a magistrate there\r\nto prove property. The trial in the United States District Court\r\nhad terminated in a verdict of $500 for the slave-owner. Judge\r\nWashington, of the Circuit Court, decided, however, that there was\r\nan error in the judgment of the lower court, that the judgment must\r\nbe reversed with costs, and the cause remitted to the District Court\r\nin order that a new trial might be had. This case is known in the\r\nlaw books as the case of Hill _vs._ Low.[804]\r\n\r\n  [804] _Washington's Circuit Court Reports_, 327-331.\r\n\r\nOccasionally an attempt at rescue ended in the arrest and\r\nimprisonment of the slave-catchers, as well as the release of the\r\ncaptured negro. When a party of rescuers went to such a length as\r\nhere indicated it laid itself liable to an action for damages on\r\nthe ground of false imprisonment, as well as to prosecution for\r\nthe penalty under the Fugitive Slave Law. This is illustrated in\r\nthe case of Johnson _vs._ Tomkins, a case belonging to the year\r\n1833.[805] It was the outgrowth of the attempt of a master to\r\nreclaim his slave from the premises of a Quaker, John Kenderdine,\r\nof Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Before the slave-owner could\r\nreturn to New Jersey, the state of his domicile, he and his party\r\nwere overtaken, and after violent handling in which the master\r\nwas injured, they were taken into custody, and were forthwith\r\nprosecuted. The trial ended in the acquittal of the company from\r\nNew Jersey, whose seizure of the negro was found to be justifiable.\r\nThen followed the prosecution of some of the Pennsylvania party for\r\ntrespass and false imprisonment, before the Circuit Court of the\r\nUnited States. The fact that the defendants were all Quakers was\r\nnoted by the judge, who found it \"hard to imagine\" the motives by\r\nwhich these persons, \"members of a society distinguished for their\r\nobedience and submission to the laws\" were actuated. The question of\r\ndamages was left exclusively to the jury. The verdict rendered was\r\nfor $4,000, and the court gave judgment on the verdict.[806]\r\n\r\n  [805] _Baldwins Circuit Court Reports_, 571-605.\r\n\r\n  [806] _Washington's Circuit Court Reports_, 327-331.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1793 provided a double penalty for those guilty of\r\ntransgressing its provisions: first, the forfeiture of a sum of\r\n$500 to be recovered for the benefit of the claimant by action of\r\ndebt; secondly, the payment of such damages as might be awarded\r\nby the court in an action brought by the slave-owner on account\r\nof the injuries sustained through the loss, or even the temporary\r\nabsence, of his property. In the famous case of Jones _vs._ Van\r\nZandt, which was pending before the United States courts, in Ohio\r\nand at Washington, for five years, from 1842 to 1847, the defendant\r\nwas compelled to pay both penalties. In April, 1842, Mr. Van Zandt,\r\nan anti-slavery Kentuckian, who had settled at Springdale, a few\r\nmiles north of Cincinnati, Ohio, was caught in the act of conveying\r\na company of nine fugitives in his market-wagon at daybreak one\r\nmorning, and, notwithstanding the efforts of the slave-catchers, one\r\nof the negroes escaped. The trial was held before the United States\r\nCircuit Court at its July term, 1843. The jury gave a verdict for\r\nthe claimant of $1,200 in damages on two counts.[807] Besides the\r\nsuit for damages, an action was brought against Van Zandt for the\r\npenalty of $500. In this action, as in the other, the verdict was\r\nfor Jones, the plaintiff. The matter did not end here, however, and\r\nwas carried on a certificate of division in opinion between the\r\njudges to the Supreme Court of the United States. The decision of\r\nthis court was also adverse to Van Zandt, and final judgment was\r\nentered against him for both amounts. This settlement was reached at\r\nthe January term in 1847.[808]\r\n\r\n  [807] _McLean's Reports_, 612.\r\n\r\n  [808] _Howard's Reports_, 215-232; see also Schuckers, _Life and\r\n  Public Services of S. P. Chase_, 53-66; Warden, _Private Life and\r\n  Public Services of S. P. Chase_, 296-298.\r\n\r\nThe successful rescue of a large company of slaves was likely to\r\nmake the adventure a very expensive one for the responsible persons\r\nthat took part in it. Such was the experience of the defendants in\r\nthe case of Giltner _vs._ Gorham and others, determined in 1847. Six\r\nslaves, the chattels of Mr. Giltner, a citizen of Carroll County,\r\nKentucky, were discovered and arrested in Marshall, Michigan, by\r\nthe agents of the claimant, but through the intervention of the\r\ndefendants were set at liberty. Action was brought to recover the\r\nvalue of the negroes, who were estimated to be worth $2,752. In the\r\nfirst trial the jury failed to agree. At the succeeding term of\r\ncourt, however, a verdict for the value of the slaves was found for\r\nthe plaintiff.[809]\r\n\r\n  [809] _McLean's Reports_, 402-426.\r\n\r\nThe value of four negroes was involved in the case of Norris _vs._\r\nNewton and others. These negroes were found in September, 1849,\r\nafter two years' absence from Kentucky, living in Cass County,\r\nMichigan. Here they had taken refuge among abolitionists and people\r\nof their own color. They were at once seized by their pursuers and\r\nconveyed across the line into Indiana, but had not been taken far\r\nwhen their progress was stopped by an excited crowd with a sheriff\r\nat its head. The officer had a writ of habeas corpus, and the temper\r\nof the crowd would admit of no delay in securing a hearing for the\r\nfugitives. The court-house at South Bend, whither the captives were\r\nnow taken, was at once crowded with spectators, and the streets\r\naround it filled with the overflow. The negroes were released\r\nby the decision of the judge, but were rearrested and placed in\r\njail for safe-keeping. On the following day warrants were sworn\r\nout against several members of the Kentucky party, charging them\r\nwith riot and other breaches of the peace, and civil process was\r\nbegun against Mr. Norris, the owner of the slaves, claiming large\r\ndamages in their behalf. Meanwhile companies of colored people,\r\nsome of whom had firearms and others clubs, came tramping into the\r\nvillage from Cass County and the intermediate country. Fortunately\r\na demonstration by these incensed bands was somehow avoided. Two\r\ndays later the fugitives were released from custody on a second writ\r\nof habeas corpus, and, attended by a great bodyguard of colored\r\npersons, were triumphantly carried away in a wagon. The slave-owner,\r\nthe charges against whom were dropped, had declined to attend the\r\nlast hearing accorded his slaves, declaring that his rights had\r\nbeen violated, and that he would claim compensation under the law.\r\nSuit was accordingly brought in the Circuit Court of the United\r\nStates in 1850, and the sum of $2,850 was awarded as damages to the\r\nplaintiff.[810]\r\n\r\n  [810] 5 _McLean's Reports_, 92-106.\r\n\r\nAnother case in which large damages were at stake was that of Oliver\r\n_vs._ Weakley and others, tried in the United States Circuit Court\r\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania, in October term, 1853. It\r\nwas alleged and proved that Mr. Weakley, one of the defendants, had\r\ngiven shelter in his barn to several slaves of the plaintiff, who\r\nwas a citizen of Maryland. The jury failed to agree on the first\r\ntrial. A second trial was therefore held, and this time a verdict\r\nwas reached; one of the defendants was found guilty, and damages to\r\nthe amount of $2,800 were assessed upon him; the other defendants\r\nwere declared \"not guilty.\"[811]\r\n\r\n  [811] 2 _Wallace Jr.'s Reports_, 324-326.\r\n\r\nThe dismissal without proper authority of seven fugitives from the\r\ncustody of their captors at Sandusky, Ohio, by Mr. Rush R. Sloane,\r\na lawyer of that city, led to the institution of two suits against\r\nhim by Mr. L. F. Weimer, the claimant of three of the slaves. The\r\nsuits were tried before the District Court of the United States\r\nat Columbus, Ohio, in 1854, and a verdict for $3,000 and costs was\r\nreturned in favor of the slaveholder. The costs amounted to $330.30,\r\nand the defendant had also to pay $1,000 in attorneys' fees. Some\r\nfriends of Mr. Sloane in Sandusky formed a committee and collected\r\n$393, an amount sufficient to pay the court and marshal's costs,\r\nbut the judgment and the other expenses were borne by the defendant\r\nindividually.[812]\r\n\r\n  [812] 6 _McLean's Reports_, 259-273. Mr. Sloane's account of the\r\n  case will be found in _The Firelands Pioneer_ for July, 1888,\r\n  pp. 46-49. A copy of the certificate of the clerk of court there\r\n  given is here reproduced:--\r\n\r\n  \"Louis F. Weimer _vs._ Rush R. Sloane. United States District of\r\n  Ohio, in debt.\r\n\r\n  OCTOBER TERM, 1854.\r\n\r\n  Judgment for Plaintiff for $3000 and costs.\r\n\r\n  Received July 8th, 1856, of Rush R. Sloane, the above Defendant,\r\n  a receipt of Louis F. Weimer, the above Plaintiff, bearing date\r\n  Dec. 14th, 1854, for $3000, acknowledging full satisfaction of\r\n  the above judgment, except the costs; also a receipt of L. F.\r\n  Weimer, Sr., per Joseph Doniphan, attorney, for $85, the amount\r\n  of Plaintiff's witness fees in said case; also certificates of\r\n  Defendant's witnesses in above case for $162; also $20 in money,\r\n  the attorney's docket fees attached, which, with the clerk and\r\n  marshal's fees heretofore paid, is in full of the costs in said\r\n  case.\r\n\r\n  (Signed)   WILLIAM MINER, _Clerk_.\"\r\n\r\nThe burden of the penalty, of which, as we have just seen, a small\r\nfraction was assumed by sympathizers with the offender in the case\r\nof Mr. Sloane, was altogether removed by friendly contributors in\r\nthe case of another citizen of Sandusky. Two negroes from Kentucky,\r\nwho were being cared for at the house of Mr. F. D. Parish, were\r\nprotected from arrest by their benefactor in February, 1845. As\r\nParish was a fearless agent of the Underground Road, the fugitives\r\nwere not seen afterwards in northern Ohio. The result was that\r\nParish was required to undergo three trials, and in the last, in\r\n1849, the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of\r\nOhio fined him $500, the estimated value of the slaves at the time.\r\nThis sum, together with the costs and expenses, amounting to as much\r\nmore, was paid by friends of Mr. Parish, who made up the necessary\r\namount by subscriptions of one dollar each.[813]\r\n\r\n  [813] For the first trial (1845), see 3 _McLean's Reports_, 631;\r\n  _s. c. 5 Western Law Journal_, 25; 7 _Federal Cases_, 1100; for\r\n  the second trial (1847), see 10 _Law Reporter_, 395; _s. c._ 5\r\n  _Western Law Journal_, 206; 7 _Federal Cases_, 1093; for the\r\n  third trial (1849), see 5 _McLean's Reports_, 64; _s. c._ 7\r\n  _Western Law Journal_, 222; 7 _Federal Cases_, 1095. See also\r\n  _The Firelands Pioneer_, July, 1888, pp. 41, 42.\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed that the Van Zandt and Parish cases were\r\nin litigation for about five years each. A famous Illinois case,\r\nthat of Dr. Richard Eells, occupied the attention of the courts and\r\nof the public more or less during an entire decade. The incidents\r\nthat gave rise to this case occurred in Adams County, Illinois, in\r\n1842. In that year Mr. Eells was indicted for secreting a slave\r\nowing service to Chauncey Durkee, of Missouri, and was convicted and\r\nsentenced to pay a fine of $400 and the costs of the prosecution.\r\nThe case was taken on writ of error first to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe state, and after the death of Mr. Eells to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States. In both instances the judgment of the original\r\ntribunal was confirmed. The decision of the federal court was\r\nreached at its December term for 1852.[814]\r\n\r\n  [814] 5 _Illinois Reports_, 498-518; 14 _Howard's Reports_, 13,\r\n  14.\r\n\r\nIt was sometimes made clear in the courts that the defendants in\r\ncases arising under the Fugitive Slave laws were persons in the\r\nhabit of evading the requirements of these laws. This is true of\r\nthe case of Ray _vs._ Donnell and Hamilton, which was tried before\r\nthe United States Circuit Court in Indiana, at the May term, 1849.\r\nA slave woman, Caroline, and her four children fled from Kemble\r\nCounty, Kentucky, and found shelter in a barn near Clarksburg,\r\nIndiana. Here they were discovered by Woodson Clark, a farmer\r\nliving in the neighborhood, who took measures immediately to inform\r\ntheir master, while the slaves were removed to a fodder-house for\r\nsafe-keeping. In some way Messrs. Donnell and Hamilton learned\r\nof the capture of the negroes by Mr. Clark, and secured a writ\r\nof habeas corpus in their behalf; but, if the testimony of Mr.\r\nClark's son, supported by certain circumstantial evidence, is to\r\nbe credited, the blacks were released from custody by the personal\r\nefforts of the defendants, and not by legal process. Considerable\r\nevidence conflicting with that just mentioned appears to have had\r\nlittle weight with the jury, for it gave a verdict for the claimant\r\nand assessed his damages at $1,500.[815]\r\n\r\n  [815] 4 _McLean's Reports_, 504-515.\r\n\r\nIn the trial of Mitchell, an abolitionist of the town of Indiana,\r\nPennsylvania, in 1853, for harboring two fugitives, some of\r\nthe evidence was intended to show that he was connected with a\r\n\"regularly organized association,\" the business of which was \"to\r\nentice negroes from their owners, and to aid them in escaping to\r\nthe North.\" The slaves he was charged with harboring had been given\r\nemployment on his farm in the country, where, as it was thought,\r\nthey would be secure. After remaining about four months they were\r\napprised of danger and escaped. Justice Grier charged the jury to\r\n\"let no morbid sympathy, no false respect for pretended 'rights\r\nof conscience,' prevent it from judging the defendant justly.\" A\r\nverdict of $500 was found for the plaintiff.[816]\r\n\r\n  [816] 2 _Wallace Jr.'s Reports_, 313, 317-323.\r\n\r\nPenalties for hindering the arrest of a fugitive slave were imposed\r\nin two other noted cases, which deserve mention here, although\r\nthey are considered at length in another connection. One of these\r\nwas Booth's case, with which the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and\r\nthe District and Supreme Courts of the United States dealt between\r\nthe years 1855 and 1858. The sentence pronounced against Mr. Booth\r\nincluded imprisonment for one month and a fine of $1,000 and\r\ncosts--$1,451 in all.[817] The other case was what is commonly known\r\nas the Oberlin-Wellington case, tried in the United States District\r\nCourt at Cleveland, Ohio, in 1858 and 1859. Only two out of the\r\nthirty-seven men indicted were convicted, and the sentences imposed\r\nwere comparatively light. Mr. Bushnell was sentenced to pay a fine\r\nof $600 and costs and to be imprisoned in the county jail for sixty\r\ndays, while the sentence of the colored man, Langston, was a fine of\r\n$100 and costs and imprisonment for twenty days.\r\n\r\n  [817] 21 _Howard's Reports_, 510; _The Fugitive Slave Law in\r\n  Wisconsin, with Reference to Nullification Sentiment_, by Vroman\r\n  Mason, p. 134.\r\n\r\nIn all of the cases thus far considered the charges upon which the\r\ntransgressors of the Fugitive Slave laws were prosecuted were,\r\nin general terms, harboring and concealing runaways, obstructing\r\ntheir arrest, or aiding in their rescue. There was, however, one\r\ncase in which the crime alleged in the indictment was much more\r\nserious, being nothing less than treason against the United States.\r\nThis was the famous Christiana case, marked not only by the nature\r\nof the indictment, but by the organized resistance to arrest made\r\nby the slaves and their friends, and by the violent death of one\r\nof the attacking party. The frequent abduction of negroes from\r\nthe neighborhood of Christiana, in southeastern Pennsylvania,\r\nseems to have given occasion for the formation, about 1851, of a\r\nleague for self-protection among the many colored persons living\r\nin that region.[818] The leading spirit in this association was\r\nWilliam Parker, a fugitive slave whose house was a refuge for\r\nother runaways. On September 10, Parker and his neighbors received\r\nword from the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia that Gorsuch, a\r\nslaveholder of Maryland, had procured warrants for the arrest of\r\ntwo of his slaves, known to be staying at Parker's house. When,\r\ntherefore, Gorsuch with his son and some friends appeared upon the\r\nscene about daybreak on the morning of the 11th, and, having broken\r\ninto the house, demanded the fugitives, the negroes lost little time\r\nin sounding a horn from one of the upper-story windows to summon\r\ntheir friends. From fifty to one hundred men, armed with guns, clubs\r\nand corn-cutters, soon came up. Castner Hanway and Elijah Lewis,\r\ntwo Quakers, who had been drawn to the place by the disturbance,\r\ndeclined to join the marshal's posse and help arrest the slaves;\r\nbut they advised the negroes against resisting the law, and warned\r\nGorsuch and his party to depart if they would prevent bloodshed.\r\nNeither side would yield, and a fight was soon in progress. In the\r\ncourse of the conflict the slave-owner was killed, his son severely\r\nwounded, and the fugitives managed to escape.\r\n\r\n  [818] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, pp. 107, 108; 2 _Wallace\r\n  Jr.'s Reports_, 159.\r\n\r\nThe excitement caused by this affair extended throughout the\r\ncountry. The President of the United States placed a company of\r\nforty-five marines at the disposal of the United States marshal,\r\nand these proceeded under orders to the place of the riot. A large\r\nnumber of police and special constables made search far and wide for\r\nthose concerned in the rescue. Their efforts were rewarded with the\r\narrest of thirty-five negroes and three Quakers, among the latter\r\nHanway and Lewis, who gave themselves up. The prisoners were taken\r\nto Philadelphia and indicted by the grand jury for treason. Hanway\r\nwas tried before the Circuit Court of the United States for the\r\nEastern District of Pennsylvania in November and December, 1851.\r\nIn the trial it was shown by the defence that Mr. Hanway was a\r\nnative of a Southern state, had lived long in the South, and, during\r\nhis three years' residence in Pennsylvania, had kept aloof from\r\nanti-slavery organizations and meetings; his presence at the riot\r\nwas proved to be accidental. Under these circumstances the charge\r\nof Justice Grier to the jury was a demonstration of the unsoundness\r\nof the indictment: the judge asked the jury to observe that a\r\nconspiracy to be classed as an act of treason must have been for\r\nthe purpose of effecting something of a public nature; and that the\r\nefforts of a band of fugitive slaves in opposition to the capture of\r\nany of their number, even though they were directed by friends and\r\nwent the full length of committing murder upon their pursuers, was\r\naltogether for a private object, and could not be called \"levying\r\nwar\" against the nation. It did not take the jury long to decide the\r\ncase. After an absence of twenty minutes the verdict \"not guilty\"\r\nwas returned. One of the negroes was also tried, but not convicted.\r\nAfterward a bill was brought against Hanway and Lewis for riot and\r\nmurder, but the grand jury ignored it, and further prosecution was\r\ndropped.[819]\r\n\r\n  [819] Still's _Underground Railroad Records_, pp. 348-368;\r\n  Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, pp. 107-130; 2 _Wallace Jr.'s\r\n  Reports_, pp. 134-206; M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, pp.\r\n  50, 51; Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol. II, pp.\r\n  328, 329.\r\n\r\nOne cannot examine the records of the various cases that have been\r\npassed in review in the preceding pages of this chapter without\r\nbeing struck in many instances by the character of the men that\r\nserved as counsel for fugitive slaves and their friends. It not\r\ninfrequently happens that one comes upon the name of a man whose\r\nprinciples, ability and eloquence won for him in later years\r\npositions of distinction and influence at the bar and in public\r\nlife. In the Christiana case, for example, Thaddeus Stevens was a\r\nprominent figure; in the Van Zandt case Salmon P. Chase and William\r\nH. Seward presented the arguments against the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nbefore the United States Supreme Court;[820] Mr. Chase also appeared\r\nin Eells' case, and in the case known as _ex parte_ Robinson,\r\nbesides others of less judicial importance. Rutherford B. Hayes took\r\npart in a number of fugitive slave cases in Cincinnati, Ohio. A\r\nletter written by the ex-President in 1892 says: \"As a young lawyer,\r\nfrom the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law until the war, I was\r\nengaged in slave cases for the fugitives, having an understanding\r\nwith Levi Coffin and other directors and officers of the U. R. R.\r\nthat my services would be freely given.\"[821] John Jolliffe, another\r\nlawyer of Cincinnati, less known than the anti-slavery advocates\r\nalready mentioned, was sometimes associated with Chase and Hayes\r\nin pleading the cause of fugitives.[822] The Western Reserve was\r\nnot without its members of the bar that were ready to display\r\ntheir legal talent in a movement well grounded in the popular\r\nmind of eastern Ohio. An illustration is afforded by the trial of\r\nthe Oberlin-Wellington rescuers, when four eminent attorneys of\r\nCleveland offered their services for the defence, declining at\r\nthe same time to accept a fee. The event shows that the political\r\naspirations of these men were not injured by their procedure, for\r\nMr. Albert G. Riddle, who spoke first for the defence, was elected\r\nto Congress from the Cleveland district the following year, and Mr.\r\nRufus P. Spalding, one of his associates, was similarly honored\r\nby the same district in 1862.[823] In November, 1852, the legal\r\nfirm of William H. West and James Walker, of Bellefontaine, Ohio,\r\nattempted to release from custody several negroes belonging to\r\nthe Piatt family of Kentucky, before their claimants could arrive to\r\nprove property. The attempt was successful, and, by prearrangement,\r\nthe fugitives were taken into a carriage and driven rapidly to a\r\nneighboring station of the Underground Railroad. The funds to pay\r\nthe sheriff, the court expenses and the livery hire were borne in\r\npart by Messrs. West and Walker.[824]\r\n\r\n  [820] Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol. I, p. 477.\r\n\r\n  [821] Letter of Mr. Hayes, Fremont, O., Aug. 4, 1892.\r\n\r\n  [822] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, pp. 548, 549.\r\n\r\n  [823] Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. II, p. 364.\r\n  The others representing the rescuers were Franklin T.

Mr. Quincy was counsel for the alleged runaway in one of the\r\nearliest cases arising under the act of 1793.[825] In some of the\r\nwell-known cases that were tried under the later act Richard H.\r\nDana, Robert Rantoul, Jr., Ellis Gray Loring, Samuel E. Sewell and\r\nCharles G. Davis appeared for the defence. Sims' case was conducted\r\nby Robert Rantoul, Jr., and Mr. Sewell; Shadrach's by Messrs. Davis,\r\nSewell and Loring; and Burns' case by Mr. Dana and others.[826]\r\n\r\n  [825] M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 35.\r\n\r\n  [826] _Ibid._, pp. 44, 46, 47.\r\n\r\nInstances gathered from other Northern states seem to indicate\r\nthat information of arrests under the Fugitive Slave acts almost\r\ninvariably called out some volunteer to use his legal knowledge\r\nand skill in behalf of the accused, and that in many centres there\r\nwere not lacking men of professional standing ready to give their\r\nbest efforts under circumstances that promised, in general, little\r\nbut defeat. Owen Lovejoy, of Princeton, Illinois, was arrested\r\non one occasion for aiding fugitive slaves, and was defended by\r\nJames H. Collins, a well-known attorney of Chicago. Returning\r\nfrom the trial of Lovejoy, Mr. Collins learned of the arrest of\r\nDeacon Cushing, of Will County, on a similar charge, and together\r\nwith John M. Wilson he immediately volunteered to conduct the new\r\ncase.[827] At the hearing of Jim Gray, a runaway from Missouri, held\r\nbefore Judge Caton of the State Supreme Court at Ottawa, Illinois,\r\nJudge E. S. Leland, B. C. Cook, O. C. Gray and J. O. Glover\r\nappeared voluntarily as counsel for the negro.[828] As a result\r\nof the hearing it was decided by the court that the arrest was\r\nillegal, since it had been made under the state law; the negro was,\r\ntherefore, discharged from the arrest, but could not be released by\r\nthe judge from the custody of the United States marshal. However,\r\nthe bondman was rescued, and thus escaped. Eight men were indicted\r\non account of this affair, prominent among whom were John Hossack\r\nand Dr. Joseph Stout, of Ottawa. Mr. Hossack, who was tried first,\r\nhad an array of six of the leading lawyers of Chicago to present his\r\nside of the case; they were the Hons. Isaac N. Arnold, Joseph Knox,\r\nB. C. Cook, J. V. Eustace, E. Leland and E. C. Larnard. Mr. Stout\r\nhad three of these men to represent him, namely, Messrs. Eustace,\r\nLarnard and Arnold.[829] Early in March, 1860, two citizens of\r\nTabor, Iowa, Edward Sheldon and Newton Woodford, were captured while\r\nconducting four runaways from the Indian Territory to a station of\r\nthe Underground Railroad. At the trial they were ably defended by\r\nJames Vincent, Lewis Mason and his brother, and were acquitted. It\r\nmay be added that the trial closed at nine o'clock in the evening,\r\nand before daybreak the negroes had been rescued and sent forward on\r\ntheir way to Canada.[830]\r\n\r\n  [827] G. H.

William Still mentions two\r\nof these, namely, David Paul Brown and William S. Pierce, as\r\n\"well-known veterans\" ready to defend the slave \"wherever and\r\nwhenever called upon to do so.\"[831] Robert Purvis relates\r\nan incident of David Paul Brown that will be recognized as\r\ncharacteristic of the spirit in which the class of advocates to\r\nwhich he belonged rendered their services for the slave. A case\r\ngrowing out of the capture of a negro by his pursuers occupied\r\nthe attention of Mr. Purvis for a season in 1836, and he desired\r\nto engage Mr. Brown for the defence; he accordingly presented\r\nthe matter to the distinguished attorney, offering him a fee of\r\nfifty dollars in advance. Mr. Brown promptly undertook the case,\r\nbut refused the money, saying: \"I shall not now, nor have I\r\never, accepted fee or reward, other than the approval of my own\r\nconscience, and I respectfully decline receiving your money.\"[832]\r\n\r\n  [831] _Underground Railroad Records_, p. 367.\r\n\r\n  [832] Smedley, _Underground Railroad_, p. 359.\r\n\r\nIn what was, so far as known, the last case under the Slave Law\r\nof 1850, Mr. John Dean, a prominent lawyer of Washington, D.C.,\r\ndisplayed noteworthy zeal in the interest of his client, a supposed\r\nfugitive. The affair occurred in June, 1862, and came within the\r\ncognizance of the United States courts. Mr. Dean, who had just\r\nobtained the discharge of the colored man from arrest, interfered\r\nto prevent his seizure a second time as the slave of a Virginian.\r\nThe claimant, aided by other persons, sought to detain the black\r\nuntil a civil officer should arrive to take him into custody, but\r\nthe attorney's surprising play at fisticuffs defeated the efforts of\r\nthe assailing party and the black got away. He soon enlisted in one\r\nof the colored regiments then forming in Washington, and it is to\r\nbe surmised that all question concerning his status was put to rest\r\nby this step. Mr. Dean was indicted for aiding in the escape of a\r\nfugitive slave, and although the affair is said to have caused great\r\nexcitement in the Capital, especially in the two Houses of Congress,\r\nit never reached a legal decision, but lapsed through the progress\r\nof events that led rapidly to the Emancipation Proclamation and the\r\nrepeal of the Fugitive Slave laws.[833]\r\n\r\n  [833] This case is given by Mr. Noah Brooks, in his _Washington\r\n  in Lincoln's Time_, 1895, pp. 197, 198.\r\n\r\nIn the crisis that was reached with the beginning of the new decade,\r\nthe question of the rendition of fugitives from service was by\r\nno means lost sight of. As in 1850, so in 1860 a measure for the\r\nmore effective protection of slave property appears to have been\r\na necessary condition in any plan of compromise that was to gain\r\nSouthern support. President Buchanan sought to meet the situation\r\nby proposing, in his message of December 4, 1860, the adoption\r\nof \"explanatory\" amendments to the Constitution recognizing the\r\nmaster's right of recovery and the validity of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw; he also recommended a declaration against the so-called\r\npersonal liberty laws of the states as unconstitutional, and\r\ntherefore void. This produced, within three months, in the House, a\r\ncrop of more than twenty resolutions relative to fugitive slaves;\r\nthe deliberations of that body issued at length, March 1, 1861,\r\nin the passage of a bill to make more effective the law of 1850.\r\nThe new measure provided for an appeal to the Circuit Court of the\r\nUnited States, where cases were to be tried by jury. But in the\r\nSenate this bill never got beyond the first reading.\r\n\r\nThat the people of the Northern states would have acquiesced in\r\na new law for the surrender of runaway negroes was certainly not\r\nto be expected. Both the law of 1793 and that of 1850 had been\r\nsystematically evaded as well as frequently denounced, and now\r\nmemorials were being sent to Congress praying for the repeal of the\r\ndespised legislation.[834] A bill for this purpose was introduced\r\ninto the House by Mr. Blake, of Ohio, in 1860, but was smothered\r\nby the attempt to amend the existing law. A similar measure was\r\nintroduced into the Senate in December, 1861, by Mr. Howe, of\r\nWisconsin, who prefaced its presentation by declaring that the\r\nFugitive Slave Law \"has had its day. As a party act it has done its\r\nwork. It probably has done as much mischief as any other one act\r\nthat was ever passed by the national legislature. It has embittered\r\nagainst each other two great sections of the country.\"[835] The bill\r\nwas referred to a committee, where it was kept for some time, and at\r\nlength was reported adversely in February, 1863.\r\n\r\n  [834] Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol. III, p.\r\n  395.\r\n\r\n  [835] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-seventh Congress, First\r\n  Session, 1356.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime slavery was subjected to a series of destructive\r\nattacks in Congress, despite the views of some, who held that the\r\ninstitution was under constitutional protection. The passions and\r\nexigencies of the War, together with the humane motives from which\r\nthe anti-slavery movement had sprung, did not leave these assaults\r\nwithout justification. In August, 1861, a law was enacted providing\r\nfor the emancipation of negroes employed in military service\r\nagainst the government; in April, 1862, slavery was abolished in\r\nthe District of Columbia; in May, army officers were forbidden to\r\nrestore fugitives to their owners; in June slavery was prohibited\r\nin the territories; and in July an act was passed granting freedom\r\nto fugitives from disloyal masters that could find refuge with the\r\nUnion forces.\r\n\r\nIn the train of these measures, and in September of the same year\r\nin which most of them were enacted, President Lincoln issued his\r\nproclamation of warning to the South declaring that all persons\r\nheld as slaves in the states continuing in rebellion on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1863, should be \"thenceforth and forever free.\" When the\r\nwarning was carried into effect on the first day of the new year by\r\nthe famous Proclamation of Emancipation, ownership of slave property\r\nin the border states was not abolished. The loyalty of these\r\nstates was their protection against interference. As the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law was not yet repealed opportunity was still afforded to\r\ncivil officers to enforce its provisions both north and south of\r\nMason and Dixon's line. North of the line there was, however, no\r\ndisposition to enforce the law. South of it wandering negroes were\r\nsometimes arrested by the civil authorities for the purpose of being\r\nreturned to their masters. The following advertisement, printed two\r\nmonths and a half after the final proclamation went into effect,\r\nillustrates the method pursued in dealing with supposed fugitives:--\r\n\r\n     \"There was committed to the jail in Warren County, Kentucky, as\r\n     runaway slave, on the 29th September, 1862, a negro man calling\r\n     himself Jo Miner. He says he is free, but has nothing to show to\r\n     establish the fact. He is about thirty-five years of age, very\r\n     dark copper color, about five feet eight inches high, and will\r\n     weigh one hundred and fifty pounds. The owner can come forward,\r\n     prove property, and pay charges, or he will be dealt with as the\r\n     law requires.\r\n\r\n  R. J. POTTER, J. W. C.\r\n\r\n  March 16, 1863. 1 m.\"[836]\r\n\r\n  [836] _Liberator_, May 1, 1863. Extract from the _Frankfort\r\n  Commonwealth_, quoted by M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p.\r\n  80.\r\n\r\nAlthough the proposition to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850\r\nhad been made in Congress in 1860, and repeated in 1861 and 1862,\r\nno definite and conclusive action was taken until 1864. During the\r\nsession of 1863-1864 five bills were introduced into the House\r\nlooking toward the repeal of the law. In the discussion of the\r\nsubject the probable effect of revocation upon the border states was\r\nfrequently dwelt upon, and it was urged by many members that the\r\nloyal slave states would consider repeal as \"insult and outrage.\"\r\nMr. Mallory, of Kentucky, was one of those that took this view.\r\nHe therefore demanded that the law \"be permitted to remain on the\r\nstatute-book,\" urging, \"If you say it will be a dead letter, so much\r\nless excuse have you for repealing it, and so much more certainly\r\nis the insult and wrong to Kentucky gratuitous.\" In reply to this\r\nand other arguments the need of enlisting negro soldiers was pressed\r\non the attention of the House, and it was said by Mr. Hubbard, of\r\nConnecticut, \"You cannot draft black men into the field while your\r\nmarshals are chasing women and children in the woods of Ohio with\r\na view to render them back into bondage. The moral sense of the\r\nnation, ay, of the world, would revolt at it.\"[837] The conclusion\r\nthat slavery was already doomed to utter destruction could not\r\nbe avoided. The House therefore decided to throw away the empty\r\nguarantee of the institution, and June 13 the vote on the bill for\r\nrepeal was taken. It resulted in the measure being carried by a vote\r\nof 82 to 57. When the bill from the House came before the Senate the\r\nquestion of repeal was already under consideration, and, indeed, had\r\nbeen for three months and a half. Nevertheless, the House measure\r\nwas at once referred to committee and was reported back June 15.\r\nIt was then discussed by the Senate for several days and voted on\r\non June 23, the result being a vote of 27 in favor of repeal to 12\r\nagainst it. Two days later President Lincoln affixed his signature\r\nto the bill, and the Fugitive Slave laws were thereby annulled June\r\n25, 1864. The constitutional provision for the recovery of runaways,\r\nwhich had been judicially declared in the decision of Prigg's case\r\nto be self-executing was not cancelled until December 18, 1865, when\r\nthe Secretary of State proclaimed the adoption of the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution by the requisite number of states.\r\n\r\n  [837] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-eighth Congress, First\r\n  Session, 2913.

Yet this side must be understood if the Underground\r\nRailroad is to appear in its true character as something more than\r\na mere manifestation of the moral sentiment existing in the North\r\nand in some localities of the South. The romantic episodes in the\r\nfugitive slave controversy have been frequently described; but it\r\nhas altogether escaped the eye of the general historian that the\r\nunderground movement was one that grew from small beginnings into\r\na great system; that it must be reckoned with as a distinct causal\r\nfactor in tracing the growth of anti-slavery opinion; that it\r\nfurnished object lessons in the horrors of slavery without cessation\r\nduring two generations to communities in many parts of the free\r\nstates; that it was largely serviceable in developing, if not in\r\noriginating, the convictions of such powerful agents in the cause\r\nas Harriet Beecher Stowe and John Brown; that it alone serves to\r\nexplain the enactment of that most remarkable piece of legislation,\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law of 1850; and, finally, that it furnished the\r\nground for the charge brought again and again by the South against\r\nthe North of injury wrought by the failure to execute the law, a\r\ncharge that must be placed among the chief grievances of the slave\r\nstates at the beginning of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nEven in colonial times there was difficulty in recovering fugitive\r\nslaves, because of the aid rendered them by friends, as is apparent\r\nfrom an examination of some of the regulations that the colonies\r\nbegan to pass soon after the introduction of slavery in 1619.\r\nThe Director and Council of New Netherlands enacted an ordinance\r\nas early as 1640, one of the provisions of which forbade\r\nall inhabitants of New Netherlands to harbor or feed fugitive\r\nservants under a penalty of fifty guilders, \"for the benefit of\r\nthe Informer; 1/3 for the new Church and 1/3 for the Fiscal.\"[838]\r\nOther regulations for the same colony contained clauses prohibiting\r\nthe entertainment of runaways; such are the laws of 1642,[839]\r\n1648,[840] 1658,[841] and, after the Dutch had been supplanted\r\nby English control, those of 1702[842] and 1730.[843] An act\r\nof Virginia that went into force in 1642 was attributed to the\r\ncomplaints made at every quarter court \"against divers persons\r\nwho entertain and enter into covenants with runaway servants and\r\nfreemen who have formerly hired themselves to others, to the great\r\nprejudice if not the utter undoing of divers poor men, thereby\r\nalso encouraging servants to run from their masters and obscure\r\nthemselves in some remote plantation.\" By way of penalty, to break\r\nup the practice of helping runaways, this law provided that persons\r\nguilty of the offence were to be fined twenty pounds of tobacco\r\nfor each night's hospitality.[844] That the law was ineffectual is\r\nindicated by the increase of the penalty in 1655 by the addition to\r\nthe twenty pounds of tobacco for each night's entertainment of forty\r\npounds for each day's entertainment.[845] Similar acts were passed\r\nby Virginia in 1657,[846] 1666,[847] and 1726.[848] The last act\r\nrequired masters of vessels to swear that they would make diligent\r\nsearch of their craft to prevent the stowing away of servants or\r\nslaves eager to escape from their owners. An act of Maryland passed\r\nin 1666 established a fine of five hundred pounds of casked tobacco\r\nfor the first night's hospitality, one thousand pounds for the\r\nsecond, and fifteen hundred pounds for each succeeding night.[849]\r\nA law of New Jersey in 1668 laid a penalty of five pounds in\r\nmoney and such damages as the court should adjudge upon any one\r\ntransporting or contriving the transportation of an apprentice\r\nor servant;[850] while another law, enacted seven years later,\r\ndeclared that every inhabitant guilty of harboring an apprentice,\r\nservant or slave, should forfeit to his master or dame ten shillings\r\nfor every day's concealment, and, if unable to pay this amount,\r\nshould be liable to the judgment of the court.[851] Provisions are\r\nalso to be found in the regulations of Massachusetts Bay,[852]\r\nRhode Island,[853] Connecticut,[854] Pennsylvania[855] and North\r\nCarolina,[856] clearly intended to discourage the entertainment or\r\nthe transportation of fugitives. It is interesting to note that in\r\nthese early times Canada was a refuge for fugitives. In 1705 New\r\nYork passed a law, which was reënacted ten years later, to prevent\r\nthe escape of negro slaves from the city and county of Albany to the\r\nFrench in Canada. The reason given for the law was the necessity of\r\nkeeping from the French in time of war knowledge that might prove\r\nserviceable for military purposes.[857]\r\n\r\n  [838] _Laws and Ordinances of New Netherlands_, 32.\r\n\r\n  [839] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n  [840] _Ibid._, 104.\r\n\r\n  [841] _Laws of New Netherlands_, 344.\r\n\r\n  [842] _Acts of Province of New York from 1691 to 1718_, p. 58.\r\n\r\n  [843] _Ibid._, 193.\r\n\r\n  [844] _Statutes at Large_, Hening, _Laws of Virginia_, I, 253.\r\n\r\n  [845] _Ibid._, I, 401.\r\n\r\n  [846] _Ibid._, I, 439.\r\n\r\n  [847] _Ibid._, II, 239.\r\n\r\n  [848] _Ibid._, IV, 168.\r\n\r\n  [849] _Maryland Archives, Assembly Proceedings_, 147.\r\n\r\n  [850] _New Jersey Laws_, 82.\r\n\r\n  [851] _Ibid._, 109.\r\n\r\n  [852] _Charters and General Laws of the Colony and Province of\r\n  Massachusetts Bay_, 386, 750 (1707 and 1718 respectively).\r\n\r\n  [853] _Proceedings of General Assembly, Colony of Rhode Island\r\n  and Providence Plantations, Providence_, 177; _Records of Colony\r\n  of Rhode Island_, 177.\r\n\r\n  [854] _Acts and Laws of His Majestie's Colony of Connecticut_,\r\n  229 (1730 probably).\r\n\r\n  [855] _Province Laws of Pennsylvania_, Philadelphia, 1725;\r\n  _Province Laws of Pennsylvania_, 325.\r\n\r\n  [856] _Laws of North Carolina_, 89 (1741); _Ibid._, 371 (1779).\r\n\r\n  [857] _Acts of Province of New York_, 77 (1705); _Laws of\r\n  Province of New York_, 218 (1715); Marion G.

DANA, Jr.,\r\n\r\nCOUNSEL FOR COLORED REFUGEES IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.]\r\n\r\nThe group of enactments just considered together with many other\r\nearly measures relating to the subject of fugitives makes it\r\nclear that the question of extradition of runaway slaves had\r\nalso arisen in colonial times. A stipulation for the return of\r\nfugitives had been inserted in the formal agreement entered into\r\nby Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Haven at the time\r\nof the formation of the New England Confederation in 1643,[858]\r\nand may be supposed to have remained in force for a period of\r\nforty years. In the first national constitution, the Articles of\r\nConfederation adopted in 1781, no such provision was made. This\r\nomission soon became serious through the action of the states of\r\nVermont, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island\r\nbetween 1777 and 1784 in taking steps toward immediate or gradual\r\nemancipation; for the first time the question of the status of\r\nfugitives in free regions was now raised.\r\n\r\n  [858] _Plymouth Colony Records_, IX, 5; Marion G. McDougall,\r\n  _Fugitive Slaves_, 7.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1787, the question arose of providing a government for the\r\nterritory northwest of the Ohio River, the difficulty was felt;\r\nand the Northwest Ordinance included a clause for the reclamation\r\nof fugitives from labor. A proposition made by Mr. King in 1785 to\r\nprohibit slavery in this region without any provision for reclaiming\r\nfugitives had gone to committee, but was never afterwards called up\r\nin Congress. In the discussion of 1787 an amendment was offered by\r\nNathan Dane, of Massachusetts, the first clause of which excluded\r\nslavery from the territory, and the second clause provided for\r\nthe rendition of fugitives. The previous delay and the prompt and\r\nunanimous approval of the compromise measure of Mr. Dane give force\r\nto the contention of a special student of the Ordinance, that the\r\nstipulation forbidding slavery could not have been adopted without\r\nthe provision for the recovery of runaways.[859]\r\n\r\n  [859] Peter Force, on the Ordinance of 1787, in the _National\r\n  Intelligencer_, 1847.

Merriam,\r\n  _Legislative History of the Ordinance of 1787_, Worcester, 1888;\r\n  M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 64.\r\n\r\nThe settlement reached in regard to fugitives appears to have\r\nexcited little comment in the various state conventions called\r\nto ratify the work of the Philadelphia Convention. It would be\r\ninteresting to know what was the nature of the discussion on the\r\npoint in the North. In the South the tone of sentiment concerning\r\nthe matter is illustrated by the remarks of Madison in the Virginia\r\nconvention, and of Iredell and Pinckney in the conventions of North\r\nand South Carolina respectively.[862] Madison asserted of the\r\nfugitive clause that it \"secures to us that property which we now\r\npossess.\" Iredell explained that \"In some of the Northern states\r\nthey have emancipated all their _slaves_. If any of our slaves go\r\nthere and remain there a certain time, they would, by the present\r\nlaws, be entitled to their freedom, so that their masters could\r\nnot get them again. This would be extremely prejudicial to the\r\ninhabitants of the Southern states; and to prevent it this clause\r\nis inserted in the Constitution. Though the word _slave_ is not\r\nmentioned, this is the meaning of it.\" Pinckney declared: \"We have\r\nobtained a right to recover our slaves, in whatever part of America\r\nthey may take refuge, which is a right we had not before. In short,\r\nconsidering the circumstances, we have made the best terms for the\r\nsecurity of this species of property it was in our power to make.\r\nWe would have made better if we could; but, on the whole, I do not\r\nthink them bad.\"[863]\r\n\r\n  [862] These views are quoted by E. B. Chase, in his _Teachings of\r\n  Patriots and Statesmen ... on Slavery_.\r\n\r\n  [863] _Ibid._ See also Elliot's _Debates_, Vol. III, 182, 277.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional provision was, of course, general in its\r\nterms, and, although mandatory in form, did not designate any\r\nparticular officer or branch of government to put it into execution.\r\nAccordingly the law of 1793 was enacted. This law, however, was\r\nof such a character as to defeat itself from the beginning.\r\nBefore the close of the year in which the measure was passed a\r\ncase of resistance occurred, which showed that adverse sentiment\r\nexisted in Massachusetts,[864] and three years later another\r\ncase--especially interesting because it concerned an escaped slave\r\nof Washington--demonstrated to the first President that there was\r\nstrong opposition in New Hampshire to the law.[865] The method of\r\nproof prescribed by the measure was intended to facilitate the\r\nrecovery of fugitives, but it was so slack that it encouraged the\r\nabduction of free negroes from the Northern states,[866] and thus,\r\nby the injustice it wrought, stirred many to give protection and\r\nassistance to negroes.[867] The number of cases of kidnapping that\r\noccurred along the southern border of the free states between 1793\r\nand 1850 helps doubtless to explain the development of numerous\r\ninitial stations of the Underground Railroad during this period.\r\n\r\n  [864] Appendix B, p. 367, 6.

It is possible that the\r\nfailure of Washington to recover his slave in 1796 furnished the\r\noccasion for the first of these.[868] A motion was made, December\r\n29, 1796, looking toward the alteration of the law.[869] Apparently\r\nnothing was done at this time, and the matter lapsed until 1801,\r\nwhen it came up in January and again in December of that year.[870]\r\nIn the month last named a committee was appointed in the House,\r\nwhich reported a bill that gave rise to considerable debate. This\r\nbill provided that employing a fugitive as well as harboring one\r\nshould be punishable; and that those furnishing employment to\r\nnegroes must require them to show official certificates and must\r\npublish descriptions of them. It is reported that Southern members\r\n\"considered it a great injury to the owners of that species of\r\nproperty, that runaways were employed in the Middle and Northern\r\nstates, and even assisted in procuring a living. They stated that,\r\nwhen slaves ran away and were not recovered, it excited discontent\r\namong the rest. When they were caught and brought home, they\r\ninformed their comrades how well they were received and assisted,\r\nwhich excited a disposition in others to attempt escaping, and\r\nobliged their masters to use greater severity than they otherwise\r\nwould. It was, they said, even on the score of humanity, good policy\r\nin those opposed to slavery to agree to this law.\"[871] Northern\r\nmembers did not accept this view of the fugitive slave question, and\r\nwhen the proposed bill was put to vote January 18, 1802, it failed\r\nof passage.[872] The division on the measure took place on sectional\r\ngrounds, all the Northern members but five voting against it, all\r\nthe Southern members but two for it.[873]\r\n\r\n  [868] William Goodell, _Slavery and Anti-Slavery_, pp. 231, 232.\r\n\r\n  [869] _House Journal_, Fourth Congress, Second Session, p. 65;\r\n  _Annals of Congress_, pp. 1741, 1767.\r\n\r\n  [870] _House Journal_, Sixth Congress, Second Session, p. 220;\r\n  _Annals of Congress_, p. 1053; _House Journal_, Seventh Congress,\r\n  First Session, p. 34; _Annals of Congress_, p. 317.\r\n\r\n  [871] _House Journal_, Seventh Congress, First Session, p. 125;\r\n  _Annals of Congress_, pp. 422, 423.\r\n\r\n  [872] The vote stood 46 to 43.\r\n\r\n  [873] _House Journal_, Seventh Congress, First Session, pp. 125,\r\n  128; _Annals of Congress_, pp. 423, 425.\r\n\r\nFor the next fifteen years Congress appears to have given no\r\nconsideration to the propriety of amending the law of 1793. Its\r\nattention was mainly occupied by the abolition of the slave-trade,\r\nthe agitation preliminary to the War of 1812, and the events of that\r\nWar.[874] At length, in 1817, a Senate committee reported a bill\r\nto revise the law, but it was never brought up for consideration.\r\nIn the same year a bill was drafted and presented to the House, on\r\naccount of the need of a remedy for the increased insecurity of\r\nslave property in the border slave states. Pindall, of Virginia,\r\nseems to have been its originator; at any rate he was the chairman\r\nof the committee that reported the proposition. The interest in the\r\ndiscussion that resulted was increased, doubtless, by two petitions,\r\none from the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, asking for a milder\r\nlaw than that in existence, the other from the Baltimore Quakers,\r\nseeking some security for free negroes against kidnapping.\r\n\r\n  [874] W. E. B. Du Bois, _The Suppression of the American Slave\r\n  Trade_, pp. 105-109.\r\n\r\nThe House bill as presented in 1817 secured to the claimant of a\r\nrunaway the right to prove his title before the courts of his own\r\nstate, and thus to reclaim his human property through requisition\r\nupon the governor of the state in which it had taken refuge;\r\nit was further provided that the writ of habeas corpus was to\r\nhave no force as against the provisions of the proposed act. The\r\nobjections made to the measure are worth noting. Mr. Holmes, of\r\nMassachusetts, disapproved of the effort to dispense with the writ\r\nof habeas corpus, stating that such action would remove a safeguard\r\nfrom the liberty of free colored people. Mr. Mason, of the same\r\nstate, declared against trial by jury, which somebody had proposed,\r\ninsisting that \"juries in Massachusetts would in ninety-nine cases\r\nout of one hundred decide in favor of fugitives, and he did not\r\nwish his town (Boston) infected with the runaways of the South.\"\r\nMr. Sergeant, of Pennsylvania, sought to amend the bill by making\r\nthe judges of the state in which the arrest occurred the tribunal\r\nto decide the fact of slavery. And, last of all, Mr. Whitman, of\r\nMassachusetts, opposed the provision making it a penal offence for\r\na state officer to decline to execute the act; a point, it should\r\nbe remarked, that came into prominence in the famous case of Prigg\r\n_vs._ Pennsylvania in 1842. Notwithstanding these efforts to modify\r\nthe bill, it was carried without change, January 30, 1818, by a\r\nvote of 84 to 69. In the Senate the bill was not passed without\r\nalteration. After a vote to limit the act to four years, the upper\r\nHouse made amendments requiring some proofs of the debt of service\r\nclaimed other than the affidavit of the claimant, and then passed\r\nthe act on March 12. The lower House did not find the modified bill\r\nto its liking, and therefore declined to consider it further.[875]\r\n\r\n  [875] _House Journal_, Fifteenth Congress, First Session, pp.\r\n  50, 86, 182, 186, 189, pp. 193, 198; _Annals of Congress_, pp.\r\n  446, 447, 513, 829-831, 838, 840, 1339, 1393. _Senate Journal_,\r\n  Fifteenth Congress, First Session, pp. 128, 135, 174, 202, 227,\r\n  228, 233; _House Journal_, p. 328; _Annals of Congress_, pp.\r\n  165, 210, 259, 262, 1339, 1716; T.

Before the close of the year the House was prompted to\r\nbestir itself again by a resolution of the Maryland legislature\r\nasking protection against citizens of Pennsylvania who were charged\r\nwith harboring and protecting fugitive slaves.[876] That the\r\nallegation was well founded cannot be doubted. Evidence has already\r\nbeen adduced to show that numerous branches of the Underground\r\nRailroad had begun to develop in southeastern Pennsylvania as early\r\nat least as the year 1800.[877] A month after the presentation of\r\nthe Maryland resolution a committee of the House was appointed.\r\nThis committee reported a bill without delay, but again nothing was\r\naccomplished. The framing of the Missouri Compromise at the next\r\nsession of Congress, in 1820, gave opportunity for the incorporation\r\nof a fugitive recovery clause, to enable Southern settlers in\r\nMissouri and other slave states to recapture their absconding slaves\r\nfrom the free territory north of the new state.[878] The fugitive\r\nclause in the Ordinance of 1787 had insured the same right for\r\nslave-owners taking land along the western frontier of Illinois.\r\n\r\n  [876] McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 23.\r\n\r\n  [877] Chapter II, pp. 21, 22.\r\n\r\n  [878] _Annals of Congress_, Sixteenth Congress, First Session,\r\n  pp. 1469, 1587.

It will be\r\n  remembered that according to the compromise Missouri was to be\r\n  admitted into the Union as a slave state, while slavery was to be\r\n  prohibited in all other territory gained from France north of 36\r\n  degrees 30 minutes. See Appendix A, p. 361.\r\n\r\nBut of what utility were such provisions unless they could be\r\ncarried into effect? Immediately after the Missouri Compromise\r\nbecame a law, propositions for new fugitive slave acts were again\r\noffered in both the House and the Senate.[879] A later attempt\r\nwas made in the winter of 1821-1822, when another resolution of\r\nthe Maryland legislature similar to the one mentioned above was\r\npresented. These efforts, like the earlier ones, failed to secure\r\nthe desired legislation.[880]\r\n\r\n  [879] _House Journal_, Sixteenth Congress, First Session, p. 427.\r\n\r\n  [880] _Senate Journal_, Sixteenth Congress, First Session,\r\n  pp. 319, 326; _Annals of Congress_, p. 618; _House Journal_,\r\n  Seventeenth Congress, First Session, p. 143; _Annals of\r\n  Congress_, pp. 553, 558, 710. _Annals of Congress_, Seventeenth\r\n  Congress, First Session, pp. 1379, 1415, 1444; Benton,\r\n  _Abridgment of the Debates of Congress_, Vol. VI, p. 296;\r\n  McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, pp. 23, 24.\r\n\r\nThe last petition of Maryland to Congress for the redress of\r\nher grievance due to the underground operations of anti-slavery\r\nPennsylvanians was made December 17, 1821. The month of January\r\nof the same year had witnessed the presentation in Congress of a\r\nresolution from the general assembly of Kentucky, protesting against\r\nCanada's admission of fugitives to her domain, and requesting\r\nnegotiation with Great Britain on the subject. In 1826, during\r\nthe administration of John Quincy Adams, negotiations were at\r\nlength opened. Henry Clay, then Secretary of State, instructed\r\nMr. Gallatin, the American Minister at the Court of St. James, to\r\npropose an agreement between the two countries providing for \"mutual\r\nsurrender of all persons held to service or labor, under the laws\r\nof either party, who escape into the territory of the other.\" His\r\npurpose in urging such a stipulation was, he declared, \"to provide\r\nfor a growing evil which has produced some, and if it be not shortly\r\nchecked, is likely to produce much more irritation.\" He also stated\r\nthat Virginia and Kentucky were particularly anxious that an\r\nunderstanding should be reached.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1827, Mr. Clay again communicated with Mr. Gallatin\r\non the subject, being led to do so by another appeal made to the\r\ngeneral government by the legislature of Kentucky. At this time he\r\nmentioned the fact that a provision for the restoration of fugitive\r\nslaves had been inserted in the treaty recently concluded with the\r\nUnited Mexican States, a treaty, it should be added, that failed\r\nof confirmation by the Mexican Senate. About five months later the\r\nAmerican Minister sent word to the Secretary of State that the\r\nEnglish authorities had decided that \"It was utterly impossible\r\nfor them to agree to a stipulation for the surrender of fugitive\r\nslaves,\" and this decision was reaffirmed in September, 1827.\r\n\r\nThe positive terms in which this conclusion was announced by\r\nthe representative of the British government might have been\r\naccepted as final at this time had not further consideration of\r\nthe question been demanded by the House of Representatives. On\r\nMay 10, 1828, that body adopted a resolution \"requesting the\r\nPresident to open a negotiation with the British government in the\r\nview to obtain an arrangement whereby fugitive slaves, who have\r\ntaken refuge in the Canadian provinces of that government, may be\r\nsurrendered by the functionaries thereof to their masters, upon\r\ntheir making satisfactory proof of their ownership of said slaves.\"\r\nThis resolution was promptly transmitted to Mr. Barbour, the new\r\nMinister, with the explanation before made to Gallatin, that the\r\nevil at which it was directed was a growing one, well calculated to\r\ndisturb \"the good neighborhood\" that the United States desired to\r\nmaintain with the adjacent British provinces. But as in the case\r\nof the former attempts to secure the extradition of the refugee\r\nsettlers in Canada, so also in this, the advances of the American\r\ngovernment were met by the persistent refusal of Great Britain to\r\nmake a satisfactory answer.[881]\r\n\r\n  [881] Niles' _Weekly Register_, Vol. XXXV, pp. 289-291; S. G.\r\n  Howe, _The Refugees from Slavery in Canada West_, pp. 12-14;\r\n  William Goodell, _Slavery and Anti-Slavery_, p. 264; M. G.\r\n  McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 25.\r\n\r\nThe agitation in Congress for a more effective fugitive slave law,\r\nand the diplomatic negotiations for the recovery of runaways from\r\nCanadian soil, which have been recounted in the preceding pages,\r\nmust be regarded as furnishing evidence of the existence in many\r\nlocalities in the free states of a strong practical anti-slavery\r\nsentiment. This evidence is reënforced by the facts presented in\r\nthe earlier chapters of this volume. The escape of slaves from\r\ntheir masters into the free states and their simple but impressive\r\nappeals for liberty were phenomena witnessed again and again by many\r\nNorthern people during the opening as well as the later decades\r\nof the nineteenth century; and deepened the conviction in their\r\nminds that slavery was wrong. Thus for years the runaway slave was\r\na missionary in the cause of freedom, especially in the rapidly\r\nsettling Western states. His heroic pilgrimage, undertaken under\r\nthe greatest difficulties, was calculated to excite active interest\r\nin his behalf. Persons living along the border of the slave states,\r\nwhose sympathies were stirred to action by their personal knowledge\r\nof the hardships of slavery, became the promoters of lines of\r\nUnderground Railroad, sending or taking fugitives northward to\r\nfriends they could trust. It was not an infrequent occurrence that\r\nintimate neighbors were called in to hear the thrilling tales of\r\nescape related in the picturesque and fervid language of negroes\r\nthat valued liberty more than life. The writer, who has heard some\r\nof these stories from the lips of surviving refugees in Canada,\r\ncan well understand the effect they must have produced upon the\r\nminds of the spectators. Many children got their lasting impression\r\nof slavery from the things they saw and heard in homes that were\r\nstations on the Underground Road. John Brown was reared in such a\r\nhome. His father, Owen Brown, was among the earliest settlers of the\r\nWestern Reserve in Ohio that are known to have harbored fugitives,\r\nand the son followed the father's example in keeping open house\r\nfor runaway slaves.[882] As early as 1815 many blacks began to\r\nfind their way across the Reserve,[883] and it is stated that even\r\nbefore this year more than a thousand fugitives had been assisted\r\non their way to Canada by a few anti-slavery people of Brown County\r\nin southwestern Ohio.[884] It is probable that numerous escapes\r\nwere also being made thus early through other settled regions. The\r\ncause for this early exodus is not far to seek. The increase of the\r\ndomestic slave-trade from the northern belt of slaveholding states\r\nto the extreme South, due to the profitableness of cotton-raising,\r\nand stimulated by the prohibition of the foreign slave-trade in\r\n1807, aroused slaves to flight in order to avoid being sold to\r\nunknown masters in remote regions. The slight knowledge they\r\nneeded to guide them in a northerly course was easily obtainable\r\nthrough the rumors about Canada everywhere current during the War\r\nof 1812.[885] The noticeable political effects of the straggling\r\nmigration that began under these circumstances is seen in the\r\nrenewed agitation by Southern members of Congress during the years\r\n1817 to 1822 for a more stringent Fugitive Slave Law, and the\r\nnegotiations with England several years later looking toward the\r\nrestoration to the South of runaways who had found freedom and\r\nsecurity on Canadian soil.\r\n\r\n  [882] Chapter II, p. 37.\r\n\r\n  [883] _Ibid._, pp. 37, 38.\r\n\r\n  [884] William Birney, _James G. Birney and His Times_, p. 435.\r\n\r\n  [885] Chapter II, p. 27.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Underground Road in spreading abroad an abiding\r\nanti-slavery sentiment was, of course, greatly restricted by the\r\ncaution its operators had to observe to keep themselves and their\r\nprotégés out of trouble. The deviating secret routes of the great\r\nsystem were developed in response to the need of passengers that\r\nwere in constant danger of pursuit. It is this fact of the pursuit\r\nof runaways into various communities where they were supposed to\r\nbe in hiding, together with the harsh scenes enacted by hireling\r\nslave-catchers in raiding some station of the Underground Road, that\r\ngave to the operations of the Road that publicity necessary to make\r\nconverts to the anti-slavery cause. During the earlier years of the\r\nRoad's development the pursuit of runaways was not so common as it\r\ncame to be after 1840, and later, after the passage of the second\r\nFugitive Slave Law in 1850; but cases are recorded, as already\r\nnoted, in 1793 in Boston, 1804 in eastern Pennsylvania, 1818 in New\r\nBedford, Massachusetts, and elsewhere. These are but illustrations\r\nof a class of early cases that brought the question of slavery home\r\nto many Northern communities with such force as could not have been\r\ndone in any other way. These cases, like the numerous cases of\r\nkidnapping that occurred during the same period, contributed not\r\na little to keep alive a sentiment that was steadily opposed to\r\nslavery, and that expressed and strengthened itself in the practice\r\nof harboring and protecting fugitives. The great effect upon public\r\nopinion of these cases, and such as these, appears from the sad\r\naffair of Margaret Garner, a slave-woman who escaped from Boone\r\nCounty, Kentucky, late in January, 1856, and found shelter with\r\nher four children in the house of a colored man near Cincinnati,\r\nOhio. Rather than see her offspring doomed to the fate from which\r\nshe had hoped to save them, she nerved herself to accomplish their\r\ndeath. While her master, successful in his pursuit, was preparing to\r\ntake them back across the river, she began the work of butchery by\r\nkilling her favorite child. Before she could finish her awful task\r\nshe was interrupted and put in prison. The efforts to prevent her\r\nreturn to Southern bondage proved unavailing, and she was at length\r\ndelivered to her master, together with the children she had meant to\r\nkill. President R. B. Hayes, who was practising law in Cincinnati at\r\nthe time, and lived on a pro-slavery street, told Professor James\r\nMonroe, of Oberlin College, that the tragedy converted \"the whole\r\nstreet,\" and that the day after the murder \"a leader among his\r\npro-slavery neighbors\" called at his house, and declared with great\r\nfervor, \"Mr. Hayes, hereafter I am with you. From this time forward,\r\nI will not only be a black Republican, but I will be a _damned\r\nabolitionist_!\"[886]\r\n\r\n  [886] James Monroe, _Oberlin Thursday Lectures, Addresses, and\r\n  Essays_, 1897, p. 116. See Appendix B, pp. 367-377, for cases\r\n  under the Slave laws.\r\n\r\nThat the doctrine of immediate abolition should find expression\r\nduring the years in which the underground movement was in its\r\ninitial stage of development, is a fact the importance of\r\nwhich should be given due recognition in tracing the growth of\r\nanti-slavery sentiment to 1830, and in showing thus what was\r\nthe preparation of the North for the advent of Garrison and his\r\nfollowers, and for the party movements in opposition to slavery. It\r\nis surely worthy of remark in this connection that, of the three men\r\nthat promulgated the idea of immediate abolition before 1830, one\r\npublished a book, containing, besides other things, an argument in\r\nsupport of the assistance rendered to fugitive slaves, while another\r\nwas known both in Ohio and in the Southern states as an intrepid\r\nunderground operator.\r\n\r\nOf the trio the first in point of time as also in pungency of\r\nstatement was the Rev. George Bourne, who went to live in Virginia\r\nabout 1809 after several years residence in Maryland. Mr. Bourne's\r\nacquaintance with slavery impressed him deeply with the evils of\r\nthe system, and he accordingly felt constrained to preach and also\r\nto publish some vehement protests against it. For this he was\r\npersecuted and driven from Virginia, and, like a hunted slave, he\r\nfound his way in the night into Pennsylvania, where he settled with\r\nhis family. Among his writings is a small volume entitled _The\r\nBook and Slavery Irreconcilable_, published in 1816 and addressed\r\nto all that professed to be members of Christian churches. In\r\nit the author vigorously and repeatedly urged the \"immediate and\r\ntotal abolition\" of slavery, and warned his contemporaries of the\r\nconsequences of continuing the system until by its growth it should\r\nendanger the Union. He could discover no palliative suitable to the\r\nevil. \"The system is so entirely corrupt,\" he said, \"that it admits\r\nof no cure but by a total and immediate abolition. For a gradual\r\nemancipation is a virtual recognition of the right, and establishes\r\nthe rectitude of the practice. If it be just for one moment, it is\r\nhallowed forever; and if it be inequitable, not a day should it be\r\ntolerated.\"[887]\r\n\r\n  [887] These quotations are taken from the summary of Bourne's\r\n  _The Book and Slavery Irreconcilable_, given in the _Boston\r\n  Commonwealth_, July 25, 1885, since the original was inaccessible\r\n  to the present writer. The summary is known to be trustworthy.\r\n  See _The Life of Garrison_, by his children, Vol. I, postscript\r\n  to the Preface, and the references to the original there given.\r\n\r\nEight years after the appearance of the book containing these\r\nuncompromising views, a treatise was published at the town of\r\nVevay on the Ohio River in southeastern Indiana by the Rev. James\r\nDuncan. This small work was entitled _A Treatise on Slavery, in\r\nwhich is shown forth the Evil of Slaveholding, both from the Light\r\nof Nature and Divine Revelation_. The purpose of the work as set\r\nforth by the author was to persuade all slaveholders that they\r\nwere \"guilty of a crime, not only of the highest aggravation,\r\nbut one that, if persisted in,\" would \"inevitably lead them to\r\nperdition.\"[888] He therefore assailed the principle of slavery,\r\ndenying the argument admitted by some of the apologists for slavery\r\namong his contemporaries, namely, \"that the emancipation of slaves\r\nneed not be sudden, but gradual, lest the possessors of them should\r\nbe too much impoverished, and lest the free inhabitants might be\r\nexposed to danger, if the blacks were all liberated at once.\" This\r\ndoctrine of the inexpediency of immediate abolition Mr. Duncan\r\ndenied, taking the position that such excuses would \"go to justify\r\nthe practice of slaveholding, because the only motive that men can\r\nhave to practise slavery is that it may be a means of preventing\r\npoverty and other penal evils. If the fear of poverty or any penal\r\nsufferings will exculpate the possessors of slaves from blame for\r\na few months or years, it will do it for life; and if some may be\r\nlawfully held to labor without wages, all may be held the same\r\nway; and if the principle of slavery is morally wrong, it ought\r\nnot to be practised to avoid any penal evil, but if just, even the\r\ncruel treatment of slaves would not condemn the practice.\"[889] He\r\nmaintained that, although the different sections of the country\r\nwere not equally guilty of the sins of slaveholding, yet the nation\r\nas a whole was responsible for the evil,--on account of the number\r\nin the free states that were friendly to slavery, on account also\r\nof the advocacy by Northern representatives of the policy of\r\nslavery extension, and, finally, on account of the slack zeal of\r\nsome of those inimical to the institution.[890] He proposed that\r\nChristians should have no church fellowship with slaveholders; he\r\nurged political action against slavery; and he supplemented the\r\nassertion that it was the duty of slaves to escape if they could,\r\nby the statement that it was impossible for any one to hinder\r\nor prevent their escape without flying in the face of the moral\r\nlaw.[891] As regards gradualism, which was practised in some states,\r\nhe said: \"If it is lawful to hold a man in bondage until he is\r\ntwenty-eight years of age, it must be equally lawful to hold him to\r\nthe day of his death; and if it is sinful to hold him to the day\r\nof his death, it must partake of the same species of crime to hold\r\nhim until he is twenty-eight.\"[892] The arguments in support of\r\nhis position he based largely upon the Decalogue, the Golden Rule\r\nand other scriptural injunctions, as well as upon the Declaration\r\nof Independence and the Constitution of the United States.[893]\r\nUnderground operators always justified themselves on these grounds;\r\nand their motives in joining the Liberty and Free Soil parties\r\nlater--as many of them did--appear not to have been other than the\r\nmotives of Bourne and Duncan in advocating political action against\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n  [888] Preface, p. viii.\r\n\r\n  [889] Preface, pp. vii, viii.\r\n\r\n  [890] _A Treatise on Slavery_, reprinted by the American\r\n  Anti-Slavery Society, 1840, p. 59.\r\n\r\n  [891] _Ibid._, p. 107. In advocating political action Mr. Duncan\r\n  said, \"The practice of slaveholding in a slave state need not\r\n  deter emancipators or others from the privilege of voting for\r\n  candidates to the legislative bodies, or from using their best\r\n  endeavors to have men placed in office that would be favorable\r\n  to the cause of freedom, and who may be best qualified to govern\r\n  the state or commonwealth, but it ought to prevent any from\r\n  officiating as a magistrate, when his commission authorizes him\r\n  to issue a warrant to apprehend the slave when he is guilty of no\r\n  other crime than that of running away from unmerited bondage.\"\r\n  This was not the first time political action was proposed,\r\n  for Mr. Bourne declared in his work (_The Book and Slavery\r\n  Irreconcilable_): \"Every voter for a public officer who will not\r\n  destroy the system, is as culpable as if he participated in the\r\n  evil, and is responsible for the protraction of the crime.\" See\r\n  the _Boston Commonwealth_, July 25, 1885.\r\n\r\n  [892] _A Treatise on Slavery_, p. 123.\r\n\r\n  [893] _Ibid._, pp. 21, 32-40, 82, 84, 87-94, 96, 107. Mr.\r\n  Duncan held that slavery was \"directly contrary to the Federal\r\n  Constitution.\" See pp. 110, 111.\r\n\r\nThe last member of the trio who complained of delay in granting\r\nfreedom to the enslaved was the Rev. John Rankin, the pastor of\r\na Presbyterian church in the town of Ripley on the Ohio River in\r\nsouthwestern Ohio. Long residence in Tennessee and Kentucky had\r\nfilled him with hatred of slavery, and for this hatred he gave\r\nhis reasons in a series of thirteen vigorous letters addressed to\r\nhis brother Thomas, a merchant at Middlebrook, Augusta County,\r\nVirginia, who had recently become a slave-owner. The letters were\r\nwritten in 1824, and were collected in a little volume in 1826. In\r\nthe preface, Mr. Rankin said that the safety of the government and\r\nthe happiness of its subjects depended upon the extermination of\r\nslavery,[894] and in the letters themselves he attacked the system\r\nof American slavery in unmistakable language. In principle he\r\nstood clearly with Bourne and Duncan, as he afterwards came to the\r\nsupport of Garrison, although he did not use the words \"immediate\r\nabolition.\" He held that \"Avarice tends to enslave, but justice\r\nrequires emancipation.\"[895] He heard with impatience the excuse\r\nfor continued slaveholding that freedom would ruin the blacks\r\nbecause they were not capable of doing for themselves, and must,\r\ntherefore, either all starve or steal. With sarcasm he exclaimed,\r\n\"Immaculate tenderness! Astonishing sympathy! But what is to be\r\ndreaded more than such tenderness and sympathy? Who would wish to\r\nhave them exercised upon himself?... And have not many of those\r\n[slaves] who have been emancipated in America become wealthy and\r\ngood citizens?... We are commanded to 'do justly and love mercy,'\r\nand this we ought to do without delay, and leave the consequences\r\nattending it to the control of Him who gave the command.\"[896] It\r\nhas been noted in another place that Mr. Rankin was for years an\r\nactive agent of the Underground Railroad, in association with a\r\nnumber of abolitionists of his neighborhood, among whom he was a\r\nrecognized leader.[897]\r\n\r\n  [894] _Letters on American Slavery_, Preface, p. iii.\r\n\r\n  [895] _Ibid._, p. 20.\r\n\r\n  [896] _Letters on American Slavery_, pp. 104, 107.\r\n\r\n  [897] Chapter IV, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. JOHN RANKIN.\r\n\r\n(From a bust by Ellen Rankin Copp, of Chicago, Illinois.)]\r\n\r\nThe idea has somehow gained credence in the general accounts of\r\nthe anti-slavery movement that the Garrisonian movement was one\r\nthat could scarcely be said to have had precursors in the earlier\r\nagitation; and the pre-Garrison abolitionists have been thought\r\nof, apparently, as marked by mild philanthropy, adherence to law\r\nand tolerance. It has been supposed that an interval of inactivity\r\nfollowed upon the earlier movements, and that the later movement\r\nwas thus a thing apart, radically different in its character from\r\nanything that had gone before. In view of the evidence brought\r\ntogether in this volume it is perhaps not too much to say that a\r\nreal continuity of development is traceable through the period with\r\nwhich we have had to do, and that many little communities throughout\r\nthe country, under the influences always at work, had germinated the\r\nidea of immediate abolition, in support of which texts were easily\r\nfound in the Bible; and that thus the way had been prepared for the\r\nanti-slavery ideas and activities of 1830 and the subsequent years.\r\nMr. Garrison himself \"confessed his indebtedness for his views\" of\r\nslavery to Bourne's _The Book and Slavery Irreconcilable_, next\r\nafter the Bible itself,[898] and in Number 17 of the first volume of\r\nthe _Liberator_ appears an extract quoted from Bourne's work.[899]\r\nIt is certain that Garrison was familiar with the work as early as\r\nSeptember 13, 1830,[900] and he may have been so earlier. He arrived\r\nat the doctrine during the summer of 1829, before his association\r\nwith Lundy at Baltimore.[901] It cannot be determined when Garrison\r\nfirst became acquainted with the _Letters on Slavery_ of the Rev.\r\nJohn Rankin, but they seem to have had a wide circulation, for about\r\nthe year 1825 they had fallen into the hands of the Rev. Samuel J.\r\nMay, living at the time in Brooklyn, Connecticut, and he had read\r\nthem with interest.[902] In the second volume of the _Liberator_\r\nGarrison republished these letters, and in after years, on more\r\nthan one occasion, he acknowledged himself the \"disciple\" of their\r\nauthor.[903]\r\n\r\n  [898] _The Life of Garrison_, by his children, Vol. 1, p. 306.\r\n\r\n  [899] _Ibid._, postscript to Preface.\r\n\r\n  [900] _Ibid._, p. 207.\r\n\r\n  [901] _The Life of Garrison_, Vol. I, p. 140.\r\n\r\n  [902] _Memoir of S. J. May_, by George B. Emerson and others, pp.\r\n  76, 78, 87, 139, 140.

The evidence\r\ngathered from surviving abolitionists in the states adjacent to the\r\nlakes shows an increased activity of the Underground Road during the\r\ndecade 1830-1840. The removal of the Indians from the Gulf states\r\nand the consequent opening of vast cotton-fields during the period\r\nnamed led many slaves to flee from the danger of transportation to\r\nthe far South.[904] Under these circumstances pursuits of runaways\r\nbecame more frequent, and were often marked by a display of anger\r\non the part of the pursuing party easily accounted for by the\r\nanti-slavery agitation in the free states. Open interference and\r\nrescues in which both negroes and whites took part became more\r\ncommon.[905] Many persons of respectability, more courageous than\r\nthe great majority of their class at that time, not only enrolled\r\nthemselves in the new anti-slavery societies, but made it a part\r\nof their duty to engage in the defence of fugitive slaves. Salmon\r\nP. Chase often served as counsel for the captured runaway during\r\nthis period, and soon gained for himself the unenvied title of\r\n\"attorney-general for fugitive slaves.\"[906] Other men of talents,\r\nposition and education were not behind the rising Ohioan in their\r\nprotection of the refugee. A formal organization of Underground\r\nRailroad workers, with Robert Purvis as president, was effected at\r\nPhiladelphia in 1838. It is evident that the Underground Railroad\r\nwas now developing with rapidity. The conditions prevailing in\r\nthe North and South during the decade 1840-1850 were not less\r\nfavorable to the escape of slaves, and, in one particular, were more\r\nfavorable; the decision in the Prigg case in 1842 took away much of\r\nthe effectiveness of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, and thus made\r\npursuit little less than useless.\r\n\r\n  [904] G.

Schuckers, _The Life and Public Service of Samuel\r\n  Portland Chase_, p. 52. For portrait see plate facing p. 254.\r\n\r\nAbout four years before this historic decision was declared, that\r\nis to say, in December, 1838, John Calhoun, of Kentucky, sought to\r\nintroduce a resolution in the House looking towards an enactment\r\nmaking it unlawful for any person to aid fugitive slaves in escaping\r\nfrom their owners, and another making it unlawful for any person\r\nin the non-slaveholding states to entice slaves from their owners,\r\nthe prosecution of offenders against these proposed laws to take\r\nplace in the courts of the United States. Objections were made to\r\nthe introduction of these resolutions, and Mr. Calhoun was prevented\r\nfrom getting a reference of the matter to the Committee on the\r\nJudiciary by a vote of 107 to 89.[907] When the Prigg decision\r\ncame, its political significance was quickly shown in the passage\r\nof laws by various Northern states forbidding their officers from\r\nperforming the duties imposed by the act of 1793. From 1842 to 1850,\r\nMassachusetts, Vermont, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island passed such\r\nlaws, and Connecticut, while repealing an earlier law on her statute\r\nbooks as being at the time unconstitutional, retained the portion of\r\nit that restrained state officers from assisting in the execution of\r\nthe act.\r\n\r\n  [907] _Congressional Globe_, Twenty-fifth Congress, Third\r\n  Session, p. 34.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Southern leaders did not fail to note the\r\nprogress of anti-slavery sentiment north of Mason and Dixon's\r\nline. This was not less manifest in the formation of the Liberty\r\nparty in the early years of the decade 1840-1850, than in the\r\nlegislative and other opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law. Indeed,\r\nso marked an impression had been made upon the minds and sympathies\r\nof anti-slavery men by the brave and successful flight of slaves,\r\nthat a Liberty convention at Peterboro, New York, in January, 1842,\r\nissued an address to slaves, declaring that slavery was to be\r\n\"tortured even unto death,\" advising them to seek liberty by flight,\r\nand assuring them that the abolitionist knew no more grateful\r\nemployment than that of helping escaping slaves to Canada. In August\r\nof the following year the national convention of the new party,\r\ncomprising nearly a thousand delegates from all the free states\r\nexcept New Hampshire, made the disavowal of the fugitive recovery\r\nclause of the Constitution a part of the party platform, voting by\r\na decisive majority \"to regard and treat the third clause of the\r\nConstitution, whenever applied to the case of a fugitive slave,\r\nas utterly null and void; and consequently as forming no part of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States whenever we are called upon\r\nor sworn to support it.\"[908] About the time of the announcement\r\nof this principle, Mr. Garrison issued in behalf of the American\r\nAnti-Slavery Society an address to the bondmen of the South, in\r\nwhich they were promised deliverance from their chains, and were\r\nencouraged to run away from their masters. \"If you come to us,\r\nand are hungry,\" ran the address, \"we will feed you; if thirsty,\r\nwe will give you drink; if naked, we will clothe you; if sick, we\r\nwill minister to your necessities; if in prison, we will visit you;\r\nif you need a hiding-place from the face of the pursuer, we will\r\nprovide one that even bloodhounds will not scent out.\"[909]\r\n\r\n  [908] Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol. I, pp.\r\n  552, 553.\r\n\r\n  [909] _Ibid._, p. 563.\r\n\r\nSuch open attacks upon the property rights of planters and\r\nslave-traders must have been extremely aggravating to Southerners,\r\nand, of course, contributed to bring the question of a more\r\neffective Fugitive Slave Law again under the consideration of\r\nCongress, notwithstanding the fact that a large share of that\r\nbody's attention was occupied during the period from 1844 to 1848\r\nwith matters connected with the annexation of Texas, the Mexican\r\nWar and the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. In 1847 the\r\nlegislature of Kentucky presented a petition to Congress urging\r\nthe importance of new laws so framed as to enable the citizens of\r\nslaveholding states to reclaim their negroes when they had absconded\r\ninto the free states. This resulted in a bill reported in the\r\nSenate, but the bill never got beyond its second reading. Two years\r\nlater an attempt was made in the House to secure legislation for the\r\nsame object, but the committee to whom the matter was referred seems\r\nnever to have reported.\r\n\r\nAt intervals more or less frequent, during a period of more than\r\nfifty years, the South had been demanding of Congress adequate\r\nprotection for its human property against the depredations of\r\nthose Northerners who rejoiced in the work of secret emancipation.\r\nThe efforts of the slaveholding section for a stricter fugitive\r\nrecovery law had uniformly failed down to 1850, and it seems\r\naltogether likely that the success won in the year named would not\r\nhave been realized,[910] if a bill intended to meet the needs of\r\nslave-owners had not been made an essential part of the great scheme\r\nof compromise for the adjustment of the differences threatening\r\nthe perpetuity of the Union at the time.[911] The measure that was\r\nfinally adopted, as a part of the programme of compromise, was one\r\nintroduced into the Senate by Mr. Mason, of Virginia, in the early\r\npart of the first session of the Thirty-first Congress. It was\r\naimed, said its author, at evils \"more deeply seated and widely\r\nextended than those\" his colleague recognized. \"The state from\r\nwhence I came,\" continued Mr. Mason, \"and the states of Kentucky and\r\nMaryland, being those states of the Union that border on the free\r\nstates, have had ample experience, not only of the difficulties,\r\nbut of the actual impossibility of reclaiming a fugitive when he\r\nonce gets within the boundaries of a non-slaveholding state.\"[912]\r\nHenry Clay, the author of the Compromise, whose disposition had\r\nbeen to lean to the Northern rather than to the Southern side of\r\nthe general controversy, expressed the irritation of his own state,\r\nKentucky, when he said concerning the question of fugitive slaves:\r\n\"Upon this subject I do think that we have just and serious cause\r\nof complaint against the free States. I think they have failed in\r\nfulfilling a great obligation, and the failure is precisely upon\r\none of those subjects which in its nature is most irritating and\r\ninflammatory to those who live in slave States.... It is our duty\r\nto make the law more effective; and I shall go with the senator\r\nfrom the South who goes furthest in making penal laws and imposing\r\nthe heaviest sanctions for the recovery of fugitive slaves and the\r\nrestoration of them to their owners.\"[913] Delaware and Missouri had\r\ngrievances similar to those of Kentucky and other border states. The\r\nregion constituted by these states suffered heavy losses through the\r\noperations of the Underground Railroad.[914]\r\n\r\n  [910] \"The wonder is how such an Act came to pass, even by so\r\n  lean a vote as it received; for it was voted for by less than\r\n  half of the Senate, and by six less than the number of senators\r\n  from the slave states alone. It is a wonder how it passed at\r\n  all; and the wonder increases on knowing that, of the small\r\n  number that voted for it, many were against it, and merely went\r\n  along with those who had constituted themselves the particular\r\n  guardians of the rights of the slave states, and claimed a lead\r\n  in all that concerned them. These self-instituted guardians\r\n  were permitted to have their own way, some voting with them\r\n  unwillingly, others not voting at all. It was a part of the plan\r\n  of 'compromise and pacification' which was then deemed essential\r\n  to save the Union; under the fear of danger to the Union on one\r\n  hand, and the charms of pacification and compromise on the other,\r\n  a few heated spirits got the control and had things their own\r\n  way.\" Benton's _Thirty Years' View_, Vol. II, p. 780.\r\n\r\n  [911] See Rhodes' _History of the United States_, Vol. I, pp.\r\n  130-136, for a discussion of the question whether the Union was\r\n  in danger in 1850.\r\n\r\n  [912] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress, First\r\n  Session, Appendix, p. 1583.\r\n\r\n  [913] _Life and Speeches of Henry Clay_, Vol. II, pp. 641, 643.\r\n  The speech from which the above quotations are made was delivered\r\n  Feb. 5 and 6, 1850.\r\n\r\n  [914] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress, Second\r\n  Session, Appendix, p. 1051; McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 31.\r\n\r\nThat the cotton states also lost considerable property every year\r\nby the escape of slaves to the North appears from a statement of\r\nSenator Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi: \"Negroes do escape from\r\nMississippi frequently,\" he said, \"and the boats constantly passing\r\nby our long line of river frontier furnish great facility to get\r\ninto Ohio; and when they do escape it is with great difficulty that\r\nthey are recovered; indeed, it seldom occurs that they are restored.\r\nWe, though less than the border states, are seriously concerned in\r\nthis question.... Those who, like myself, live on that great highway\r\nof the West--the Mississippi River--and are most exposed, have a\r\npresent and increasing interest in the matter. We desire laws that\r\nshall be effective, and at the same time within the constitutional\r\npower of Congress; such as shall be adequate, and be secured by\r\npenalties the most stringent which can be imposed.\"[915] Calhoun\r\nadmitted that discontent was universal in the South, and declared\r\nthat conciliation could only come when the North consented to meet\r\ncertain conditions, one of which was the restoration of fugitive\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n  [915] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress, First\r\n  Session, Appendix, p. 1615.\r\n\r\nMany of the speeches contained suggestions and prophecies of\r\ndisunion. One of these, made by Pratt, of Maryland, called the\r\nattention of the Senate to a recent address delivered by Mr. Seward,\r\nof New York, before an assembly of Ohioans, in which he urged them\r\nto \"extend a cordial welcome to the fugitive who lays his weary\r\nlimbs at your door, and _defend him as you would your household\r\ngods_.\"[916] Another made by Yulee, of Florida, informed the Senate\r\nof a convention then sitting at Cazenovia, New York, attended\r\nby more than thirty runaway slaves, and held for the purpose of\r\ndevising ways and means of escape for blacks. The language of the\r\naddress to slaves issued by the convention was not calculated to\r\nreassure slave-owners. In part it ran: \"Including our children,\r\nwe number here in Canada 20,000 souls. The population in the free\r\nStates are, with few exceptions, the fugitive slave's friends.\r\n\r\n  [916] _Ibid._, p. 1592.\r\n\r\n\"We are poor. We can do little more for your deliverance than pray\r\nto God for it. We will furnish you with pocket compasses, and in the\r\ndark nights you can run away. We cannot furnish you with weapons;\r\nsome of us are not inclined to carry arms; but if you can get them,\r\ntake them, and, before you go back into bondage, use them, if you\r\nare obliged to take life. The slaveholders would not hesitate to\r\nkill you, rather than not take you back into bondage.\r\n\r\n\"Numerous as the escapes from slavery are, they would still be\r\nmore so, were it not for the master's protection of the rights of\r\nproperty. You even hesitate to take the slowest of his horses; but\r\nwe say take the fastest. Pack up provisions and clothes; and either\r\nget a key, or force the lock, and get his money and start.\"[917]\r\nIn view of such proceedings, openly conducted without hindrance,\r\nthe Senator appealed to his auditors and to the country to consider\r\nwhether \"this Union can long continue?\"[918]\r\n\r\n  [917] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress, First\r\n  Session, Appendix, pp. 1622, 1623.\r\n\r\n  [918] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nIn his famous 7th-of-March speech, Webster freely admitted that\r\nthe complaints of the South in regard to the non-rendition of\r\nfugitive slaves were just, and that the North had fallen short of\r\nher duty. He therefore decided to support Mason's Fugitive Slave\r\nBill, although he wanted it amended in certain particulars, and\r\nsought especially to have in it a clause securing trial by jury\r\nto the refugee in case he denied owing service to the claimant.\r\nHe criticised the abolition societies of the North, and said he\r\nthought their operations for the last twenty years had produced\r\n\"nothing good or valuable.\" The press of the South he found to be\r\nas violent as that of the other section. There was, he decided, \"no\r\nsolid grievance presented by the South within the redress of the\r\ngovernment, ... but the want of a proper regard to the injunction of\r\nthe Constitution for the delivery of fugitive slaves.\"[919]\r\n\r\n  [919] _Webster's Works_, Vol. V, pp. 354, 355, 357, 358, 361.\r\n\r\nUnder the combined championship of Webster, Clay and Calhoun, and\r\nto bring about better feeling between the two parts of the country,\r\nwhich in the eyes of many contemporaries seemed on the verge of\r\nsplitting asunder, the new Fugitive Slave Law was passed by the\r\nSenate, August 26, 1850, and by the House a few days later. By the\r\nsignature of President Fillmore the measure became a law, September\r\n18.\r\n\r\nThe vote by which the new law had been passed through the two Houses\r\nof Congress did not betoken a disposition at the North to meet\r\nthe obligations it imposed upon that section. Only three of the\r\nsenators representing free states voted for the measure. These were\r\nDodge and Jones, of Indiana, and Sturgeon, of Pennsylvania. Among\r\nthe one hundred and thirty-six members from the Northern states\r\nin the House, only thirty-one voted with the slaveholders. Three\r\nof the thirty-one were Whigs, the rest Democrats.[920] Jefferson\r\nDavis showed that he comprehended the true situation when he said,\r\nduring the following session of Congress, that the history of the\r\nlaw proved that it would not furnish the needed security, because\r\nthe Northern majority did not pass the bill, but merely allowed\r\nthe Southern minority to pass it, and because the measure had to\r\nbe executed in the North.[921] This view of the case seems not to\r\nhave been taken by those representing the border slave states.\r\nThe comprehensive character of Clay's scheme was favorable to the\r\nincorporation in it of a measure stringent enough to suit the most\r\naggrieved without exciting the opposition such a measure would have\r\ncalled out if presented by itself.\r\n\r\n  [920] Von Holst, _Constitutional and Political History of the\r\n  United States_, Vol. IV, pp. 18, 19.

See also Von Holst's work, Vol. IV, p.\r\n  27.\r\n\r\nWhatever the expectations of the various slaveholding states with\r\nregard to the recovery of their runaways under the new law, Joshua\r\nR. Giddings, himself an enthusiastic agent of the Underground\r\nRailroad and a better judge of the real convictions of the North\r\nthan Webster, took the earliest occasion to give utterance to the\r\nsentiments of the people upon whom depended the success or failure\r\nof the law of 1850. Giddings did not delay, nor did he mince\r\nmatters. In the earliest days of the session following that in which\r\nthe compromise had been passed he denounced the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nand predicted its failure. Concerning the citizens of his own state,\r\nhe said: \"The freemen of Ohio will never turn out to chase the\r\npanting fugitive. They will never be metamorphosed into bloodhounds,\r\nto track him to his hiding-place, and seize and drag him out, and\r\ndeliver him to his tormentors. Rely upon it they will die first....\r\nLet no man tell me there is no higher law than this fugitive bill.\r\nWe feel there is a law of right, of justice, of freedom, implanted\r\nin the breast of every intelligent human being, that bids him look\r\nwith scorn upon this libel on all that is called law.\"[922]\r\n\r\n  [922] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress, Second\r\n  Session, pp. 15, 16. Von Holst, _Constitutional and Political\r\n  History of the United States_, Vol. IV, p. 15.\r\n\r\nThat slave-owners counted on deriving benefits from the law appears\r\nfrom the great number of attempts at once made to reclaim runaways,\r\nand the frequent prosecutions of those guilty of facilitating their\r\nescape. The period sometimes designated the \"era of slave-hunting\"\r\nbegan in the North. Slave-owners and their agents entered vigorously\r\nupon the chase, and a larger number of communities in the free\r\nstates than ever before were invaded by men engaged in the\r\ndisgusting business of capturing blacks, intelligent and ambitious\r\nenough to seek their own liberty. Villages, towns and cities from\r\nIowa to Maine, but especially in the middle states, witnessed\r\nscenes calculated to awaken the popular detestation of slavery as\r\nit had never been awakened before. Pitiable distress fell upon the\r\nfugitive settlers in the North and did much to quicken consciences\r\neverywhere. The capture of a fugitive in the place where he had\r\nbeen living invariably caused an outburst of indignation; and if\r\nthe victim were not rescued before his removal by his captors a\r\nsum of money was raised if possible, and his freedom was purchased\r\nif that could be done. All of these circumstances contributed to\r\nincrease the traffic along the numerous and tortuous lines of the\r\nUnderground Railroad, which, according to the testimony of surviving\r\nabolitionists, did its most thriving business in all parts of the\r\nNorth during the decade from 1850 to 1860. The marked increase in\r\nthe number of negroes seeking aid on their way to Canada at the\r\noutset of this period was due to the flight of many of the fugitive\r\nsettlers from their accustomed haunts in the free states; but the\r\nsupply later on must be attributed to the ease of communication\r\nthrough various channels by which slaves were every day learning\r\nof the body of abolitionists eager to help them to freedom. The\r\nreadiness of the Northern people to act in opposition to the law\r\narose from their abhorrence of a measure that they considered\r\nunrighteous and cruel, and from their resentment at the requirement\r\nthat they must join in the hunt, so that the fugitive might be\r\npromptly enslaved.[923] The wide-spread opposition to the law led\r\nto prosecutions of underground workers in various places, and these\r\nprosecutions greatly helped to keep the slavery question before the\r\nattention of the country, despite the wishes and endeavors of the\r\npoliticians who strove to silence the issue.[924]\r\n\r\n  [923] McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 53.\r\n\r\n  [924] \"These prosecutions attracted more attention to the slavery\r\n  question in a few months than the abolitionists had been able to\r\n  arouse in twenty years.\" Professor Edward Channing, _The United\r\n  States of America, 1765-1865_, p. 241.\r\n\r\nThe record of the year 1851 illustrates the character of the general\r\ncontest, which had already set in before the enactment of the new\r\nlaw, but which assumed thenceforth an importance it had never had\r\nbefore. Early in the year Shadrach was seized in Boston, carried\r\nbefore the commissioner, and remanded to custody, but was rescued\r\nby a crowd of negroes and hurried off to Canada. Later Sims was\r\ncaught and confined in the court-house until he was marched to Long\r\nWharf under guard of three hundred policemen. William and Ellen\r\nCraft, fugitives from Georgia, were tracked to Boston, but, aided by\r\nTheodore Parker and other faithful friends, succeeded in escaping\r\nto England. Other notable instances of pursuit occurred at Chicago,\r\nIllinois, Poughkeepsie, New York, and Westchester and Wilkesbarre,\r\nPennsylvania. At Philadelphia a free negro was arrested, proved a\r\nslave by perjured testimony and taken to Maryland; fortunately he\r\ngained his liberty again by the refusal of the planter to whom he\r\nwas delivered to identify him as his lost property. At Buffalo an\r\nalleged fugitive was released on writ of habeas corpus by Judge\r\nConkling. At the hearing that followed the lack of evidence caused\r\nthe judge to discharge the prisoner, and he was soon in Canada. In\r\nthe attempt of the Maryland slave-owner, Gorsuch, and his party,\r\nto recover certain runaway slaves from Christiana, Pennsylvania,\r\nGorsuch was killed and his son seriously wounded, while the\r\nfugitives managed to escape. This affair caused intense excitement,\r\nnot only in Pennsylvania, but throughout the country. Another case\r\nresulting in the death of one of the parties concerned grew out of\r\nthe kidnapping of a free negro girl from the house of a Mr. Miller,\r\nin Nottingham, Pennsylvania; Miller succeeded in rescuing the girl,\r\nbut he was mysteriously murdered before he reached home. Near the\r\nclose of the year 1851 Jerry McHenry was arrested in Syracuse, New\r\nYork, while an agricultural fair and a convention of the Liberty\r\nparty were in progress in that city. The attempted escape and the\r\nrecapture of the negro wrought up the crowd to a state of intense\r\nfeeling, which was not relieved until the fugitive was rescued\r\nand sent to Canada.[925] There were many other instances in which\r\ncommunities were given the opportunity to show their spirit in the\r\ndefence of helpless bondmen.\r\n\r\n  [925] F. W. Seward, _Seward at Washington as Senator and\r\n  Secretary of State_, 1891, Vol. I, pp. 169, 170. McDougall,\r\n  _Fugitive Slaves_, pp. 44, 47-51, 58, 59.\r\n\r\nThe political leaders and the administration, who were responsible\r\nfor the enactment of the Fugitive Slave Law, were not willing to see\r\nits provisions thus trampled under foot. Upon the reassembling of\r\nCongress in December, 1850, President Fillmore expressed himself in\r\nhis message as pleased with the compromise measures, although, he\r\nadmitted, they had not yet realized their purpose fully. \"It would\r\nbe strange,\" he said, \"if they had been received with immediate\r\napprobation by people and states prejudiced and heated by the\r\nexciting controversies of their representatives.\" He nevertheless\r\nhad faith that the various enactments would be generally sustained.\r\nThe tinge of doubt in the communication of the President pretty\r\ncertainly referred to the fierce denunciations of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law recently uttered by mass-meetings in various parts of\r\nthe Northern states, and to several cases of resistance where the\r\nexecution of the law had been attempted. His reassuring expressions\r\nvoiced his own hope and that of the political magnates; and he meant\r\nalso, perhaps, to carry assurance to the South. Some balm seemed\r\nnecessary, for the Georgia convention in accepting the compromise\r\nas a \"permanent adjustment of the sectional controversy,\" voted,\r\n\"That it is the deliberate opinion of this convention that upon\r\nthe faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Bill by the proper\r\nauthorities depends the preservation of our much-loved Union.\"[926]\r\n\r\n  [926] _Boston Atlas_, Dec. 17, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe open resistance to the law upon several occasions in 1851\r\nbrought opportunities to the administration to exert itself in favor\r\nof the faithful execution of the law. After the rescue of Shadrach\r\nfrom the United States marshal on February 15, much excitement\r\nexisted, especially at the centre of government. The President\r\nimmediately issued a proclamation commanding all civil and military\r\nofficers, and calling on all good citizens, to \"aid in quelling\r\nthis and similar combinations\" and to assist in capturing the\r\npersons that had set the law at defiance. The Senate, after debate,\r\nadopted a resolution requesting the President to lay before it\r\ninformation relating to the rescue, and inquiring whether further\r\nlegislation was desirable. This request was promptly complied\r\nwith by the executive. Then Clay, the author of the resolution,\r\nurged that the President be invested with extraordinary power to\r\nenforce the law, but failed to gain substantial support for his\r\nproposition. In the meantime five of the rescuers of Shadrach were\r\nindicted and tried, but owing to the disagreement of the jury none\r\nof them were convicted. The energetic action of the administration\r\nand its supporters had apparently accomplished no result, except\r\nto demonstrate the difficulties with which the enforcement of the\r\nFugitive Slave Act was encompassed.\r\n\r\nThe same lesson was taught in two important instances toward the\r\nend of this year, when the government undertook to carry the law\r\ninto effect. The Gorsuch tragedy at Christiana, Pennsylvania, led\r\nthe President to order the United States marshal, district attorney\r\nand commissioner from Philadelphia, with forty-five United States\r\nmarines from the navy-yard, to assist in arresting those supposed\r\nto have been engaged in the fight. The fugitives had escaped and\r\ncould not be recovered, but a number of other persons, most of whom\r\nwere colored, were arrested, taken to Philadelphia, and indicted\r\nfor treason. But the efforts of the authorities to convict were\r\nunavailing, and the prisoners went scot free.[927]\r\n\r\n  [927] For references see Appendix B, 53, Christiana case, p. 373.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nin September of the previous year, the spirit of resistance in\r\nSyracuse, New York, had manifested itself in public meetings\r\nat which the law was denounced and a Vigilance Committee\r\norganized.[928] In the early part of June following, Daniel Webster,\r\nwho was travelling extensively through the Northern states and\r\nexerting his personal and official influence to secure obedience\r\nto the law, visited Syracuse and made a speech. In the course of\r\nhis remarks he insisted in no conciliatory terms that the law\r\nmust be enforced. He said, \"Those persons in this city who mean\r\nto oppose the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law are traitors!\r\ntraitors!! traitors!!! This law ought to be obeyed, and it will be\r\nenforced--yes, it shall be enforced, and that, too, in the midst\r\nof the next anti-slavery convention, if then there shall be any\r\noccasion to enforce it.\"\r\n\r\n  [928] S. J. May, _Some Recollections of our Anti-Slavery\r\n  Conflict_, p. 349.\r\n\r\nAs if in fulfillment of this prediction of the Secretary of\r\nState, on October 1, 1851, a day when a convention of the Liberty\r\nparty was in progress, an attempt was made to capture one Jerry\r\nMcHenry, an undoubted fugitive; but the Vigilance Committee, under\r\nefficient leadership, succeeded in rescuing him out of the hands of\r\nhis captors. At this outcome there was much exultation among the\r\nanti-slavery people, as also when later the prosecution instituted\r\nagainst eighteen of the rescuers ended in a failure to convict. It\r\nis worthy of note that Seward was the first to sign the bond of\r\nthose indicted; and that Gerrit Smith, then a member of Congress,\r\nmade a defiant speech in the fall of 1852 in Canandaigua, where the\r\ntrial of one of the rescuers was going on.[929]\r\n\r\n  [929] _Ibid._, pp. 373-384; Frothingham, _Life of Gerrit Smith_,\r\n  p. 117; McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, pp. 48, 49; Wilson, _Rise\r\n  and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol. II, pp. 327, 328.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.]\r\n\r\nSuch incidents, together with the aggravation caused by the removal\r\nof fugitives successfully seized, made it plain that the compromise\r\nwas not the \"finality\" that the politicians declared it to be;\r\nand that the Whig and Democratic parties chose to decree it in\r\ntheir national platforms in the summer of 1852. The principles of\r\npolitical opposition determined by the conditions of the time\r\nwere uttered by the convention of the Free Soil party, with which\r\nmany of the underground operators were now allied, in the words:\r\n\"No more slave states, no more slave territories, no nationalized\r\nslavery, and no national legislation for the extradition of\r\nslaves.\" The issue of the presidential campaign in the election of\r\nPierce, a compromise Democrat, marks only a temporary disturbance\r\nin the progress of sentiment, due to the desire of the country to\r\nhave rest, the disinclination of many Whigs to support their own\r\ncandidate, General Winfield Scott, and the policy of acquiescence\r\nhe represented; and the solidarity of action among the Democrats,\r\nwho were generally satisfied both with their principles and their\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nAs it was the Fugitive Slave Law that brought the North face to\r\nface with slavery nationalized, so it was the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nthat occasioned, in the spring of 1852, the production of _Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin_, a novel the great political significance of which\r\nhas been generally acknowledged. The observations and experience\r\nthat made possible for Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe the writing of\r\nthis remarkable book were gained by her while living at Cincinnati,\r\nwhere she was enabled to study the effects of slavery. While thus a\r\nresident on the borders of Kentucky, she numbered among her friends\r\nslaveholders on the one side of the Ohio River and abolitionists on\r\nthe other. At the time of her first trip across the Ohio in 1833,\r\nshe visited an estate, which is described as that of Colonel Shelby\r\nin _Uncle Tom's Cabin_.[930] Her associations and sympathies brought\r\nhome to her the personal aspects of slavery, and her house on Walnut\r\nHills early become a station on the Underground Railroad, remaining\r\nso doubtless till 1850, when she removed with her husband, Professor\r\nCalvin Stowe, to Brunswick, Maine.\r\n\r\n  [930] C. E. Stowe, _Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe_, pp. 71, 72.\r\n\r\nDuring the intervening years she was unconsciously gleaning\r\nincidents and scenes and discovering characters for her future\r\nbook. The woful experiences of her midnight visitors, whose hunger\r\nfor freedom rose superior to every other need, awoke her deepest\r\ncompassion, and the neighborhood in which she lived, nay, even\r\nher own household, supplied the circumstances and adventures\r\ndepicted in the lives of some of her most admirable characters.\r\nMrs. Stowe herself declared _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ to be \"a collection\r\nand arrangement of real incidents,--of actions really performed,\r\nof words and expressions really uttered,--grouped together with\r\nreference to a general result, in the same manner that the mosaic\r\nartist groups his fragments of various stones into one general\r\npicture.\"[931] For example she points out that the service of\r\nSenator Bird in the incident of the novel in which Eliza escapes\r\nfrom her pursuers Tom Locker and Marks had its counterpart in the\r\nservice rendered a negro girl in her own employ by Professor Stowe\r\nand his brother-in-law, Henry Ward Beecher, in 1839. This girl was\r\nsecretly conveyed northward by her escorts a distance of twelve\r\nmiles to the house of John Van Zandt, another station-keeper of\r\nthe Underground Road; and Van Zandt it was who \"performed the good\r\ndeed which the author in her story ascribes to Van Tromp.\"[932]\r\nConcerning the leading Quaker character in her book Mrs. Stowe\r\nsays: \"The character of Rachel Halliday was a real one, but she\r\nhas passed away to her reward. Simeon Halliday, calmly risking\r\nfine and imprisonment for his love to God and man, has had in this\r\ncountry many counterparts among the sect. The writer had in mind,\r\nat the time of writing, the scenes in the trial of Thomas Garet,\r\nof Wilmington, Delaware, for the crime of hiring a hack to convey\r\na mother and four children from Newcastle jail to Wilmington, a\r\ndistance of _five_ miles.\"[933] The thrilling adventures of Eliza in\r\nescaping across the Ohio River with her child in her arms as the ice\r\nwas breaking up was an actual occurrence that took place fifty miles\r\nabove Cincinnati, at Ripley, an initial station of an important\r\nunderground route.[934]\r\n\r\n  [931] _A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin_, p. 5; Charles Dudley Warner\r\n  in _The Atlantic Monthly_, September, 1896, p. 312.\r\n\r\n  [932] _A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin_, p. 23; C.

W.\r\n  Shuckers, _Life of Chase_, p. 53.\r\n\r\n  [933] _A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin_, p. 54.\r\n\r\n  [934] _Reminiscences of Levi Coffin_, pp. 147-151; Howe,\r\n  _Historical Collections of Ohio_, Vol. II, p. 104; see also\r\n  article on \"Early Cincinnati,\" by Judge Joseph Cox in the\r\n  _Cincinnati Times-Star_, Feb. 6, 1891; a report of \"The Story\r\n  of Eliza,\" as told by the Rev. S. G. W. Rankin, printed in the\r\n  _Boston Transcript_, Nov. 30, 1895, an article on Harriet Beecher\r\n  Stowe, in the _Cincinnati Enquirer_, Nov. 3, 1895, p. 17.\r\n\r\nBy the combination of such elements under the crystallizing\r\ninfluence of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Mrs. Stowe made her\r\nstory. Intent on having the people of the North understand what\r\nthe \"system\" was, about which so many seemed apathetic, she set to\r\nwork in response to appeals to her to take up her pen. The result,\r\nwholly unexpected, was the production of a book that did for the\r\nwhole population of the free states what the Underground Railroad\r\nhad been doing for a part only: the author made real the sin of\r\nslavery to the consciences of freemen, by an object-lesson in the\r\npossible evils of slavery and the desire of the slave to be free. In\r\nHarriet Beecher Stowe the thousands of fugitive slaves that had been\r\nunwittingly acting as missionaries in the cause of freedom through\r\nthe earlier years found at last a champion whose words carried their\r\ntouching story to the multitudes. The disheartening circumstances\r\nunder which her novel had been composed and the exhausted condition\r\nin which the author found herself at its conclusion did not permit\r\nher to look for anything but the failure of her undertaking. As\r\nshe finished the last proof-sheets \"it seemed to her that there\r\nwas no hope; that nobody would hear, nobody would read, nobody\r\nwould pity; that this frightful system, which had already pursued\r\nits victims into the free States, might at last even threaten them\r\nin Canada.\"[935] But the success of the book was immediate. Three\r\nthousand copies were sold on the first day of publication, and more\r\nthan three hundred thousand in this country within the year.[936]\r\n\r\n  [935] Quoted by Charles Dudley Warner in _The Atlantic Monthly_,\r\n  September, 1896, p. 315.\r\n\r\n  [936] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nThe political effect of the novel has been disparaged by a few\r\nwriters, because it did not cause anti-slavery gains in the national\r\nelection occurring in the fall of 1852. Thus George Ticknor wrote\r\nin December of that year, \"It deepens the horror of servitude,\r\nbut it does not affect a single vote.\"[937] This was certainly\r\ntrue, for the mass of Northerners were resting in the belief that\r\na substantial political settlement had been reached in the great\r\ncompromise. It was not to be expected that this belief, which was\r\nthe outcome of weeks of strenuous discussion, was to be easily\r\ntossed aside under the emotional stimulus of a novel. The immediate\r\neffect of _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ as a political agency lay in the\r\nrenewal on a vast scale of the consideration of the question of\r\nslavery, which the compromise had been thought by so many to have\r\nsettled. Its remote effect, which did not show itself until the\r\nlatter part of the decade 1850-1860 has been best explained by\r\nthe historian, James Ford Rhodes. This writer says, \"The mother's\r\nopinion was a potent factor in politics between 1852 and 1860,\r\nand boys in their teens in the one year were voters in the other.\r\nIt is often remarked that previous to the war the Republican\r\nparty attracted the great majority of school-boys, and that the\r\nfirst voters were an important factor in its final success; ...\r\nthe youth of America whose first ideas on slavery were formed by\r\nreading _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ were ready to vote with the party whose\r\nexistence was based on opposition to an extension of the great\r\nevil.\"[938] They were also ready to fight for the cause of union and\r\nof freedom in 1861.\r\n\r\n  [937] _Life of George Ticknor_, Vol. I, p. 286.\r\n\r\n  [938] _History of the United States_, Vol. I, pp. 284, 285.\r\n\r\nSoon after the publication of Mrs. Stowe's book, Sumner began\r\nhis movement in the Senate to secure the repeal of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law. In May, 1852, he presented a memorial from the Society\r\nof Friends in New England, asking for its repeal;[939] in July\r\nhe offered a resolution instructing the Committee on Judiciary\r\nto report a bill for this purpose;[940] and in August he sought\r\nto secure his end by proposing an amendment to the civil and\r\ndiplomatic appropriations bill.[941] In the speech made at the\r\ntime he presented this amendment, a speech said to rank with that\r\nof Webster on the Compromise in 1850 in the popular interest it\r\naroused, Sumner pointed to the example of Washington, who let one of\r\nhis slaves remain unmolested in New Hampshire rather than \"excite a\r\nmob or riot, or even uneasy sensations in the minds of well-disposed\r\ncitizens.\" The execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, he asked\r\nCongress to note, involved mobs, cruelty and violence everywhere its\r\nenforcement was tried. The wonderful reception given _Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin_ was, he thought, an expression of the true public sentiment.\r\n\"A woman, inspired by Christian genius, enters the lists, like\r\nanother Joan of Arc, and with marvellous powers sweeps the chords\r\nof the popular heart. Now melting to tears, and now inspiring to\r\nrage, her work everywhere touches the conscience, and makes the\r\nslave-hunter more hateful.\"[942] He saw the import of the appeal of\r\nfugitive slaves to Northern communities for protection and liberty.\r\n\"For them every sentiment of humanity is aroused. Rude and ignorant\r\nthey may be, but in their very efforts for freedom they claim\r\nkindred with all that is noble in the past. Romance has no stories\r\nof more thrilling interest; classical antiquity has preserved no\r\nexamples of adventure and trial more worthy of renown. They are\r\namong the heroes of our age. Among them are those whose names will\r\nbe treasured in the annals of their race. By eloquent voice they\r\nhave done much to make their wrongs known, and to secure the respect\r\nof the world. History will soon lend her avenging pen. Proscribed\r\nby you during life, they will proscribe you through all time. Sir,\r\nalready judgment is beginning; a righteous public sentiment palsies\r\nyour enactment.\"[943]\r\n\r\n  [939] Peirce, _Life of Sumner_, Vol. III, p. 283.\r\n\r\n  [940] _Ibid._, p. 289.\r\n\r\n  [941] _Ibid._, p. 292.\r\n\r\n  [942] Peirce, _Life of Sumner_, Vol. III, pp. 296, 297;\r\n  _Congressional Globe_, Vol. XXV, p. 1112.\r\n\r\n  [943] _Congressional Globe_, Vol. XXV, p. 1112; Peirce, _Life of\r\n  Sumner_, Vol. III, p. 297.\r\n\r\n  In a public speech made in 1850 Mr. Garrison had this to say,\r\n  \"Who are among our ablest speakers? Who are the best qualified to\r\n  address the public mind on the subject of slavery? Your fugitive\r\n  slaves,--your Douglasses, Browns and Bibbs,--who are astonishing\r\n  all with the cogency of their words and the power of their\r\n  reasoning.\" _Life of Garrison_, Vol. III, p. 311.\r\n\r\nThrough his denunciation of the law, his justification of those\r\nwho aided the fugitive, and his recognition of the power of\r\nthe fugitive's appeal, Sumner may be said to have become the\r\nrepresentative and spokesman in the Senate of fugitive slaves and\r\ntheir Northern friends. How closely he identified himself with their\r\ncause is indicated by his determined efforts to secure the repeal\r\nof the obnoxious law, efforts repeated in July, 1854, and February,\r\n1855, and carried by him to a successful issue in 1864.[944]\r\n\r\n  [944] Peirce, _Life of Sumner_, Vol. III, p. 309, foot-note; Vol.\r\n  IV, pp. 71, 175-177.\r\n\r\nThe action of public sentiment in the Northern states, which, he\r\nsaid, palsied the Fugitive Slave Law, was accompanied, during the\r\ndecade from 1850 to 1860, by tokens of open violation of the law,\r\ndefiant resolutions adopted by mass-meetings, and obstructional\r\nlegislation passed by various free states; the spirit of\r\nnullification was thus aroused in many localities north of Mason and\r\nDixon's line. The demands of character and humanity had long been\r\nobeyed by many men and women for whom any compromise involving the\r\ncontinuance in slavery of their fellow-men was a dreadful crime.\r\nThese persons had refused to yield obedience to that statute which\r\nin their belief was subversive of the \"higher law.\" Under the\r\naction of causes that have been discussed in earlier chapters, the\r\nsentiment that had developed the secret and illicit traffic along\r\nnumerous lines of the Underground Railroad became more obtrusive and\r\nless regardful of congressional legislation. Besides participating\r\nin the public and legitimate activities of anti-slavery societies,\r\nand sharing in the organization of the Liberty and Free Soil\r\nparties, the abolitionists formed vigilance committees in various\r\ncommunities, the avowed purpose of which was to thwart the Fugitive\r\nSlave Act; and while these bodies held their meetings in secret\r\nand guarded the names of their members, it was often a matter of\r\ncommon report in those localities that certain well-known men of the\r\nneighborhood were active members. It was the Vigilance Committee of\r\nSyracuse that rescued Jerry McHenry from custody of the officers,\r\nin the presence of a great crowd; and the leaders in the affair,\r\nGerrit Smith, Charles A. Wheaton and Samuel J. May, far from seeking\r\noblivion, published an acknowledgment in the newspapers that they\r\nhad aided all they could in the rescue of Jerry, were ready for\r\ntrial, and would rest their defence on the \"unconstitutionality and\r\nextreme wickedness\" of the Fugitive Slave Law. None of these men\r\nwere tried. The citizens of Onondaga County held a mass-convention\r\nin approval of the liberation of the negro, and unanimously adopted\r\nresolutions justifying and applauding the act.[945]\r\n\r\n  [945] S. J. May, _Some Recollections of our Anti-Slavery\r\n  Conflict_, pp. 380, 381. Mr. May says another convention was held\r\n  ten days later to condemn the action of the rescuers, and did so,\r\n  but not without dissent.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on till the outbreak of the Civil War bold and open\r\nopposition to the authority of the federal law is a purpose not to\r\nbe mistaken or overlooked. The state reports of the Pennsylvania\r\nand Massachusetts Anti-Slavery societies boasted of the steadily\r\nincreasing numbers of fugitives aided by abolitionists at many\r\ncentres, and heaped reproaches on the judges and commissioners that\r\ngave decisions adverse to runaways.[946] Fugitive slave cases were\r\nstubbornly contested in the courts on the ground that the law of\r\n1850 was unconstitutional. The series of cases in which the law was\r\nsubjected to the penetrating criticism of some of the ablest lawyers\r\nin the country is a long and interesting one; nothing in the history\r\nof the times more clearly shows the effect of the Underground\r\nRailroad in rousing ever-widening indignation at the hunt for\r\nfugitives.[947]\r\n\r\n  [946] See the reports after 1850.\r\n\r\n  [947] For selected cases see Appendix B, p. 372.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1854 two cases, one in Wisconsin and the other\r\nin Massachusetts, served to show the pitch to which the spirit of\r\nresistance among the most responsible citizens could rise in both\r\nthe West and the East. On March 10, 1854, Joshua Glover, who was\r\nliving near Racine, Wisconsin, was arrested as a fugitive slave by\r\nUnited States deputy marshals and the claimant, B. W. Garland, of\r\nSt. Louis. After a severe struggle Glover was knocked down, placed\r\nin a wagon, driven to Milwaukee, and there lodged in jail. The\r\nnews of the capture reached Racine in a few hours, and a popular\r\nmeeting, larger than ever before held in the town, assembled on the\r\ncourt-house square to take action. At this meeting it was resolved\r\nto secure Glover a fair trial in Wisconsin; and it was voted,\r\n\"That inasmuch as the Senate of the United States has repealed all\r\ncompromises adopted by the Congress of the United States,[948]\r\nwe, as citizens of Wisconsin, are justified in declaring, _and\r\ndo declare, the slave-catching law of 1850 disgraceful and also\r\nrepealed_.\" This was but one of many nullifying resolutions adopted\r\nabout this time in various parts of the North, although most of the\r\nresolutions were somewhat less extreme in statement.[949]\r\n\r\n  [948] The Kansas-Nebraska legislation, repealing the Missouri\r\n  Compromise of 1820, which was at this time before Congress, is\r\n  here referred to.\r\n\r\n  [949] Vroman Mason on \"The Fugitive Slave Law in Wisconsin, with\r\n  Reference to Nullification Sentiment,\" in the _Proceedings of the\r\n  State Historical Society of Wisconsin_, 1895, pp. 122, 123.\r\n\r\nAt an afternoon meeting the deliberations ended in the decision\r\nof about a hundred citizens of Racine to take boat at once for\r\nMilwaukee. Upon arrival this delegation found the latter city in an\r\nuproar. A meeting of five thousand persons had already appointed a\r\nCommittee of Vigilance to see that Glover had a fair trial, and this\r\ndemonstration had led the authorities to call for the local militia\r\nto preserve order; but the militia did not appear. Such was now the\r\ntemper of the crowd that it could be satisfied with nothing less\r\nthan the immediate release of the prisoner. Glover was therefore\r\ndemanded, but, as he was not forthcoming, the jail door was battered\r\nin, the negro brought out, placed in a wagon and forwarded to Canada\r\nby the Underground Railroad. The act of the rescuers was indorsed by\r\nthe public sentiment of the state; with but few exceptions justified\r\nby the newspapers. Among the resolutions passed by mass-meetings\r\nheld to take action against the Kansas-Nebraska bill, then pending\r\nin Congress, there was usually one thanking the rescuers for their\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nRemembering with satisfaction the deliverance of Jerry, a special\r\nconvention assembled at Syracuse, New York, on March 22, 1854, and\r\nsent a congratulatory message to Milwaukee and Racine, offering\r\nto join them and all the sister cities of the North in a \"holy\r\nconfederacy, which ... shall swear that no broken-hearted fugitive\r\nshall ever again be consigned to slavery from the North, under the\r\naccursed act of 1850.\" A state convention met at Milwaukee, April\r\n13 and 14, which was attended by delegates from all the populated\r\ndistricts. This assembly adopted a number of resolutions, several of\r\nwhich were quotations from the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions,\r\nincluding the famous one declaring \"that, as in other cases of\r\ncompact among parties having no common judge, each party has an\r\nequal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions, as of the\r\nmode and measure of redress.\" The Fugitive Slave Law was pronounced\r\nunconstitutional, and aid was promised the rescuers of Glover.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that at this convention a state league was\r\nalso formed, which has been called a forerunner of the Republican\r\nparty in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the state was soon given an opportunity to\r\nplace itself on record with regard to the validity of the federal\r\nlaw. The case of one of the rescuers, Sherman M. Booth, came before\r\nit for decision. In passing judgment the court showed itself to\r\nbe in line with the sentiment of the state, for it declared the\r\nact of 1850 unconstitutional; the principal grounds assigned were\r\nthe absence of congressional power to legislate on the subject of\r\nthe surrender of fugitives from labor, the improper conferring\r\nof judicial authority upon commissioners, and the viciousness of\r\ndepriving a person of his liberty 'without due process of law.'\r\nBooth was, of course, discharged. But the matter was not dropped\r\nhere. The United States District Court now obtained jurisdiction\r\nof the case; the jury found the prisoner guilty, and the judge\r\nsentenced him to imprisonment for one month, and to pay a fine of\r\n$1,000 and the costs of prosecution--in all, $1,451. The news of\r\nthe conviction caused great excitement; denunciatory meetings were\r\nagain the order of the day; and money was subscribed for the further\r\ndefence of the prisoners. Some of the resolutions passed at this\r\ntime did not stop short of asserting the readiness of the people to\r\nmaintain their cause with the bayonet. Application was made to the\r\nSupreme Court of the state for a writ of habeas corpus, and Booth,\r\ntogether with a colleague, Rycraft, was again released.\r\n\r\nThe controversy now came before the Supreme Court at Washington, and\r\non petition of the Attorney-General a writ of error was granted by\r\nthat tribunal to be served on the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. The\r\nstate court, however, refused to obey this writ. At length, on March\r\n6, 1857, the United States Supreme Court assumed jurisdiction,\r\nin an unusual way, acting on the basis of a certified copy of\r\nproceedings, which did not appear upon the official record. At the\r\nDecember term, 1858, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin\r\nwas reversed, and that court was directed to return Booth into\r\nfederal custody. Again the state court would not yield obedience.\r\nBooth was therefore rearrested by the United States marshal, March\r\n1, 1860, and was confined in the custom-house at Milwaukee. The\r\nfriends of the prisoner once more applied to the state Supreme Court\r\nfor a writ of habeas corpus, but, failing to get it on account of\r\na change in the personnel of the court, they did not rest until\r\nthey had rescued him from the government prison five months later.\r\nOn October 8 Booth was again arrested, and this time he remained\r\nin prison until, under the pressure brought to bear upon President\r\nBuchanan, he was pardoned just before Lincoln's inauguration.[950]\r\n\r\n  [950] Ableman _vs._ Booth; for references see Appendix B, 62,\r\n  Glover rescue case, p. 374.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the obstinacy of the highest state court in refusing\r\nto carry out the commands of the highest United States court,\r\nthe decision rendered by the latter in Booth's case was of great\r\nimportance. It clearly defined for the first time the limits of\r\nstate authority and disclosed the powerlessness of state courts\r\nto override the jurisdiction granted to the federal courts by the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe people of Wisconsin, however, were unwilling to recognize this\r\nfact. Having enacted a personal liberty law in 1857, they made\r\nByron Paine, a young lawyer, who had taken a prominent part in the\r\ndefence of Booth, their candidate in 1859 for associate justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and elected him on a combined anti-slavery and\r\nstate rights issue. Thus the state maintained its ground until the\r\neve of the Civil War. Then it relinquished it to assist in coercing\r\nSouth Carolina and other Southern states from their secession, the\r\nright of which these states defended by the same doctrine of state\r\nsovereignty.[951]\r\n\r\n  [951] This account of Booth's case is in the main a condensation\r\n  of the excellent and exhaustive discussion given by Mr. Vroman\r\n  Mason in the _Proceedings of the State Historical Society_,\r\n  1895, pp. 117-144. Other material will be found in _The Story of\r\n  Wisconsin_, 1890, by R. G. Thwaites, pp. 247-254; _A Complete\r\n  Record of the John Olin Family_, 1893, by C. C.

The attempted rescue of Burns came just after this\r\npiece of legislation, already passed by the Senate, had been voted\r\nby the House. This measure, which set aside the Missouri Compromise\r\nprohibiting slavery from all the Louisiana territory lying north of\r\n36° 30' north latitude, except that included within the State of\r\nMissouri, deeply stirred public feeling in the free states: thus\r\nthe violence of the demonstrations in the Booth and Burns cases was\r\nin some measure a protest against Douglas legislation. Burns was\r\narrested in Boston on May 24, 1854, under a warrant granted by the\r\nUnited States commissioner. He felt his case to be hopeless, and so\r\ntold Richard H. Dana, Jr., and Theodore Parker; but they urged him\r\nto make a defence, and prevailed on the commissioner to postpone the\r\nhearing. Boston was soon ablaze with indignation kindled in part by\r\nthe inflammatory handbills scattered broadcast by members of the\r\nVigilance Committee. These handbills contained invectives against\r\nthe \"kidnapper,\" and expressed a sentiment prevalent in New England,\r\nas in other parts of the North, when they declared \"the compromises\r\ntrampled upon by the slave power when in the path of slavery are to\r\nbe crammed down the throat of the North.\"\r\n\r\nIn response to messages from the Vigilance Committee Thomas\r\nWentworth Higginson, A. Bronson Alcott and others hurried to Boston\r\nto consult with the leaders there on what was best to be done. A\r\nmass-meeting had been called for Friday evening, the 26th, to be\r\nheld in Faneuil Hall, and it was now planned to make an attack, at\r\nthe height of this meeting, on the court-house, where Burns was in\r\ndurance, and \"send the whole meeting pell-mell to Court Square,\r\nready to fall in behind the leaders and bring out the slave.\" The\r\ncity was in a state of wild excitement when the time for action\r\ncame, and it was natural that in the confusion existing some of\r\nthe arrangements should miscarry. The crowd that filled Faneuil\r\nHall was so dense as to cut off all communication with the speakers\r\non the platform, and prevented concerted action. When, under the\r\nimpassioned oratory of Phillips, Parker and others, the audience\r\nhad given evidences of its readiness to undertake the rescue,\r\nthe announcement that an attack upon the court-house was about\r\nto begin was made from the rear of the hall, and it was proposed\r\nthat the meeting should adjourn to Court Square. Phillips had not\r\nreceived notice of the project, and the other speakers had not fully\r\ncomprehended it. The alarm was thought to be a scheme to break up\r\nthe meeting and was not followed by the decisive action necessary to\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nArriving at the court-house the crowd found a small party under the\r\nlead of Higginson, Stowell and a negro battering in a door with\r\na stick of timber. Entrance was gained by a few only,--who found\r\nthemselves in the hands of the police,--while the concourse outside\r\nwas daunted at the outset by the mysterious killing of one of the\r\nmarshal's deputies. The arrest of several of Higginson's companions\r\nfollowed, and a renewal of the assault, if there was any danger\r\nof such a thing, was prevented by the approach of two companies\r\nof artillery and two more of marines ordered out by the mayor to\r\npreserve the peace. Troops were retained at the court-house during\r\nthe examination of Burns, and it is reported by an eye-witness that\r\nthe seat of justice \"had the air of a beleaguered fortress.\" On the\r\n2d of June Commissioner Loring remanded the fugitive to slavery.\r\n\r\nThe presence in Boston of a multitude of visitors attracted thither\r\nby the annual meeting of the New England Anti-Slavery Society, the\r\nstate convention of the Free Soil party, and the spring meetings\r\nof the religious bodies, as well as by the arrest of the negro,\r\nled the authorities to take all precautions to forestall any fresh\r\nattempt at rescue when the fugitive should be sent out of the city.\r\nAccordingly, over a thousand soldiers with loaded muskets, and\r\nfurnished with a cannon loaded with grape-shot, were detailed to\r\nassist the city police and a large number of deputy marshals to\r\ncarry out the law. In the procession that accompanied Burns to the\r\nUnited States revenue cutter, by which he was to be carried back\r\nto Virginia, there were four platoons of marines and a battalion\r\nof artillery, besides the marshal's civil posse of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five men. Fifty thousand people lined the streets along which\r\nthis procession passed, and greeted it with hisses and groans, while\r\nover their heads were displayed many emblems of mourning and shame.\r\nIt is little wonder that the _Enquirer_ of Richmond, Virginia,\r\ncommenting with satisfaction on the rendition of Burns, was led to\r\nadd, \"but a few more such victories and the South is undone.\"[952]\r\nSuch was the state of public opinion in Massachusetts that the Board\r\nof Overseers of Harvard College declined to confirm the election\r\nof Commissioner Loring as a member of the Harvard faculty; and the\r\npeople petitioned, until their request was granted, for his removal\r\nfrom the office of judge of probate.\r\n\r\n  [952] T. W. Higginson in _The Atlantic Monthly_, for March, 1897,\r\n  p. 349-354; Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. I, pp.\r\n  500-506; Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power_, Vol. II, pp.\r\n  434, 444.\r\n\r\nSimilar hostility to the Fugitive Slave Law existed in Illinois.\r\nJohn Reynolds, who had been governor of the state, wrote about 1855\r\nthat when President Jackson issued his proclamation in December,\r\n1832, condemning nullification in South Carolina, the legislature\r\nof Illinois hailed it with gratification and pledged the state to\r\nsustain the executive in his purpose to enforce the federal laws at\r\nall hazards. Jackson's proclamation, he said, had a strong tendency\r\nto suppress the spirit of nullification throughout the Union. The\r\nlaw of 1850 had been framed in pursuance of the Constitution, and\r\nwas hailed as the foundation of sectional peace and happiness, but\r\n\"within a few years, a section of the State of Illinois, the city\r\nof Chicago, is not disposed to execute this act of Congress. The\r\nopposition in Illinois to this law is not extensive, but confined to\r\na single city, so far as I know. Yet in that disaffected district\r\nthe act is a dead letter....\"[953] The number of centres in Illinois\r\nin which the act was disapproved and violated was far beyond the\r\nknowledge of ex-Governor Reynolds.\r\n\r\n  [953] John Reynolds' _History of Illinois_, 1855, pp. 269-271.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio incidents arising out of the operations of the Underground\r\nRailroad became the occasions for serious contests between the state\r\nand federal authorities. On May 15, 1857, the United States deputy\r\nmarshal for southern Ohio, with nine assistants, entered the house\r\nof Udney Hyde, near Mechanicsburg, Champaign County, in pursuit of\r\na fugitive slave. The approach of the posse had been observed by\r\nthe negro, who took refuge in Hyde's garret. Some firing was done\r\nby both the negro and the marshal, with the result that the officer\r\nand his party were glad to take their positions outside of the\r\nhouse. Here they were soon found by a crowd of citizens from the\r\nneighboring town, whose sympathies were so unmistakably with the\r\nfugitive that the pursuers decided to leave without delay. Returning\r\ntwelve days later, they were told that the fugitive, Addison White,\r\nhad gone to Canada. Thereupon they arrested several persons in the\r\nneighborhood on the charge of aiding a slave to escape, and set off\r\nwith these persons ostensibly for Urbana, where the examination was\r\nto be held.\r\n\r\nInstead of going to Urbana, the party took a southern course through\r\nClark and Green counties. The sheriff of Clark County, who organized\r\na company to give chase, overtook the marshal and his men, and\r\nreceived at their hands a severe beating. Bands of angry citizens\r\nnow scoured the country, and, at length, after a skirmish locally\r\nknown as \"the battle of Lumbarton,\" captured the marshal's posse. On\r\nthe charge of assault with intent to kill, the prisoners were placed\r\nin jail at Springfield. This action occasioned a serious clash\r\nbetween the United States District Court for the southern district\r\nof Ohio and the state courts; and the federal tribunal asserted\r\nits jurisdiction by releasing the marshal's posse, although in the\r\ndecision rendered it was admitted that there \"was a question whether\r\nthe marshal had not exceeded authority in the use of unnecessary\r\nforce.\"\r\n\r\nSo critical had the situation now become that Governor Chase\r\ndetermined to have a personal conference with President Buchanan and\r\nthe Secretary of State, General Cass. The Governor therefore sent\r\nan officer of his staff to Washington to arrange for the meeting,\r\nand to say to the Secretary of State that Mr. Chase \"was as earnest\r\nin support of the authority of the federal government, legitimately\r\nexercised, as he was in support of the authority of the state; but\r\nthat he should feel compelled to protect the state officials in\r\nthe exercise of their duties, and the state courts in the exercise\r\nof their legitimate functions, if it took every man in the state\r\nto do it.\" In order to adjust the existing differences before they\r\nculminated in open hostility between the two governments, it was\r\nproposed on the part of Mr. Chase that the United States district\r\nattorney at Cincinnati be instructed to drop all suits against\r\ncitizens of the state, with the understanding that a similar\r\ncourse be followed by the state with regard to the marshal and his\r\ndeputies. At the formal meeting this was the plan adopted. Thus the\r\naffair was amicably settled, although it did not fail to leave a\r\ndeep impression on the public mind, and to evoke comments from the\r\npress indicative of the restiveness of the abolitionists under the\r\njurisdiction of United States courts in fugitive slave cases.[954]\r\n\r\n  [954] The _Cincinnati Enquirer_, the leading Democratic paper of\r\n  southern Ohio at the time, said of the contention arising out of\r\n  the attempted arrest of Addison White: \"The designation of the\r\n  attorney-general by Governor Chase to aid the lawyer retained\r\n  by the sheriff of Clark County, is equivalent to a declaration\r\n  of war on the part of Chase and his abolition crew against the\r\n  United States Courts. Let war come, the sooner the better.\"\r\n  Quoted in the _Life of Chase_, by J. W. Schuckers, p. 179,\r\n  foot-note. Material relating to the Addison White case will be\r\n  found in Shuckers, _Life of Chase_, pp. 177-182; Warden, _Life\r\n  of Chase_, pp. 350, 351; Beer, _History of Clark County, Ohio_;\r\n  the same quoted by Henry Howe in his _Historical Collections of\r\n  Ohio_, Vol. I, pp. 384-386. The writer has also had the advantage\r\n  of a conversation with Mrs. Amanda Shepherd (the daughter of\r\n  Udney Hyde), who was an eye-witness of the attempts to capture\r\n  White at her father's house.\r\n\r\nAnother example of open violation of the Slave Law, which resulted\r\nin conflict between the federal and state courts, exists in the\r\nfamous Oberlin-Wellington rescue case. On September 13, 1858, two\r\nslave-catchers, provided with the necessary papers, and accompanied\r\nby the proper officers, arrested a runaway near the town of\r\nOberlin, in which he had been living for more than two years.\r\nNews of the capture was brought to Oberlin by two young men, who\r\nsaw the negro in the hands of his captors as they were proceeding\r\ntoward Wellington. A large crowd of men, among whom were several\r\nstudents and a professor of Oberlin College, took the trail of the\r\nslave-catchers, found them at Wellington, and without violence freed\r\nthe slave. The arrest of a large number of the rescuers followed,\r\nand their arraignment took place before the United States District\r\nCourt at Cleveland. Public sentiment was clearly with the prisoners,\r\nand their counsel were men of high rank in their profession. Two\r\nof the offenders were tried and convicted. On account of the state\r\nof feeling at the time, the legal proceedings were denounced as\r\npolitical trials. Mass-meetings were held throughout eastern Ohio\r\nto express the sympathy of the people with the rescuers, and to\r\ncast odium on the federal courts. The Dred Scott decision, recently\r\nrendered by the Supreme Court at Washington, called down upon that\r\ntribunal much condemnation. At an immense mass-convention held in\r\nCleveland, May 24, 1859, resolutions were adopted, which accepted\r\nthe compact theory of government voiced in the Virginia and Kentucky\r\nresolutions, declared the equal right of each party to the compact\r\n\"to judge for itself, as well of infractions, as of the mode and\r\nmeasure of redress,\" and declared the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850\r\nto be void because, \"in the opinion of this assembly, passed by\r\nCongress in the exercise of powers improperly assumed.\"[955] A fund\r\ndenominated \"the Fund of Liberty\" was created, to be applied in\r\ndefence of the Oberlin rescuers, and a committee was appointed to\r\ntake action for the release of those persons.\r\n\r\n  [955] J. R. Shipherd, _History of the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue_.\r\n  The resolutions appear at pp. 253, 254.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the grand jury of Lorain County--the county in which the\r\nfugitive had been seized--had indicted four of the slave-catchers\r\nunder a personal liberty law passed by Ohio in 1857.[956] This\r\nprocedure led to negotiations, which finally terminated in a\r\ncompromise between the executors and the opponents of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Act. On the one hand the United States authorities agreed\r\nto stop prosecution in the remaining rescue cases, while on the\r\nother hand the Lorain County people consented to dismiss the suits\r\nagainst the so-called kidnappers. This conclusion of the matter was\r\nregarded as a victory for the \"higher law\" by the friends of the\r\nOberlin parties, and the release of the prisoners was heralded in\r\nCleveland by the firing of a hundred guns. Their return to Oberlin\r\nwas signalized by a celebration in their honor. The _Cleveland Plain\r\nDealer_ said the government had been \"beaten at last with law,\r\njustice, and facts all on its side, and Oberlin with its rebellious\r\nHigher Law creed is triumphant.\"[957]\r\n\r\n  [956] _Ibid._, pp. 231-235.\r\n\r\n  [957] The _Plain Dealer_, July 6, 1859, quoted by Shipherd, p.\r\n  267.\r\n\r\nThat these events were not without their political influence is\r\napparent from the adoption of a resolution at the great Cleveland\r\nconvention above mentioned asserting that the chief reliance of\r\nfreedom in the United States rested in the Republican party.[958]\r\nIt is worthy of note also that this party at its state convention,\r\nheld in June, demanded the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act.[959] It\r\nhas been already pointed out that some of the counsel of the Oberlin\r\nrescuers early received places of political preferment, partly at\r\nleast in consequence of distinction won by them in the defence of\r\nthose known to be guilty of violating the law of 1850.[960]\r\n\r\n  [958] Shipherd, _History of the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue_, pp.\r\n  253, 254.\r\n\r\n  [959] The _Cleveland Herald_, June 3, 1859.\r\n\r\n  [960] Chapter IX, p. 282.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of personal liberty laws by various Northern states,\r\nwith the purpose of impairing the efficiency of the Fugitive Slave\r\nlaws, is characteristic of the period during which the underground\r\nsystem had its most rapid expansion, namely, the two decades from\r\n1840 to 1860. These laws may be fairly considered as the palpable\r\nbut guarded expression of an opposition that was free to go to the\r\nfull length in its midnight operation of the Underground Road.\r\nDuring the period indicated occurred the series of celebrated\r\nfugitive slave cases, beginning with the Latimer case in 1842; and\r\nthe precautions, rarely neglected by the friend of the slave, were\r\noften forgotten or spurned in the excitement of the instant or\r\nin the exaltation of wrath. The rigorous character of the law of\r\n1850 acted in two ways north of Mason and Dixon's line: first, it\r\ncreated a reaction against slavery and brought many recruits into\r\nunderground work to aid the rapidly increasing number of escaping\r\nslaves; second, in connection with the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise, it led public sentiment in many states to provide\r\nadditional safeguards in the form of personal liberty bills for the\r\nprotection of fugitives and their helpers.[961] These bills ran\r\ncounter in spirit if not always in letter to legislation that was\r\nheld by the United States Supreme Court to be in keeping with the\r\nconstitutional clause providing for the recovery of fugitive slaves.\r\nIn principle they were, therefore, like the nullification ordinance\r\nof 1832.[962]\r\n\r\n  [961] Joel Parker, _Personal Liberty Laws and Slavery in the\r\n  Territories_, 1861, pp. 10, 11.\r\n\r\n  [962] J. B. Robinson, _Pictures of Slavery and Anti-Slavery_,\r\n  1863, pp. 332, 333; M. G. McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p.\r\n  70; Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. II, p. 74.\r\n  Mr. Rhodes says of the personal liberty bills: \"They were\r\n  dangerously near the nullification of a United States law,\r\n  and had not the provocation seemed great, would not have been\r\n  adopted by people who had drunk in with approval Webster's idea\r\n  of nationality.... While they were undeniably conceived in a\r\n  spirit of bad faith towards the South, they were a retaliation\r\n  for the grossly bad faith involved in the repeal of the Missouri\r\n  Compromise. Nullification cannot be defended, but in a balancing\r\n  of the wrongs of the South and the North, it must be averred\r\n  that in this case the provocation was vastly greater than the\r\n  retaliation.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the system of the Underground Railroad was thus expanding and\r\npressing everywhere against legislative restraints, there arose a\r\nman who sought to solve the whole slavery problem in his own rash\r\nway. When John Brown led a company of slaves from Missouri to Canada\r\ndespite the attempts to prevent him; and when soon thereafter he\r\nattempted to execute his plan for the general liberation of slaves,\r\nhe showed the extreme to which the aid to fugitives might lead.\r\nThe influence of Brown's training in Underground Railroad work is\r\nplain in the methods and plans he followed, which have given him\r\na place in American history. Early convinced that action was the\r\nthing needed to help the bondman, he set himself to find a way\r\nof effecting the destruction of slavery. In devising his scheme\r\nhe seems to have considered an underground channel of escape as\r\na necessary feature of it for those lacking the courage to join\r\na movement sure to involve them in armed conflict with their\r\nmasters. This feature was designated the \"Subterranean Pass Way.\"\r\nThe varying character of the testimony in regard to this feature,\r\nas well as the natural change of view that took place in Brown's\r\nmind with the passage of the years, does not permit one to say\r\ndefinitely what importance was attached by the liberator to the\r\nPass Way as a part of his plan, but its utility in reducing the\r\nvalue of slaves must have been apparent to him. That the whole\r\nmovement he contemplated would have the effect of making slave\r\nproperty unstable he showed when speaking of the initiative of the\r\nmovement in Virginia. Brown said: \"If the slaves could in this way\r\nbe driven out of the county, the whole system would be weakened in\r\nthat State.\"[963] In this matter the judgment of the liberator was\r\nnot at fault, for it has been estimated that his attack on Harper's\r\nFerry caused the value of slave property in Virginia to decline to\r\nthe extent of $10,000,000.[964] That Brown had the sympathy of a\r\nlarge number of persons in the North, including some public men, was\r\na circumstance calculated to make a deeper impression on the minds\r\nof the Southern men generally than this decline in the price of\r\nVirginia slaves.\r\n\r\n  [963] Hinton, _John Brown and His Men_, pp. 31, 32.\r\n\r\n  [964] _Ibid._, p. 30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN JOHN BROWN.\r\n\r\n(From a photograph in the possession of the Kansas State Historical\r\nSociety.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of Underground Railroad operations in steadily\r\nwithdrawing from the South some of its property and thus causing\r\nconstant irritation to slave-owners and slave-traders has already\r\nbeen commented upon. The persons losing slaves of course regarded\r\ntheir losses as a personal and undeserved misfortune. Yet,\r\nconsidering the question broadly from the standpoint of their own\r\ninterests, the work of the underground system was a relief to the\r\nmasters and to the South. The possibility of a servile insurrection\r\nwas a dreadful thing for Southern minds to contemplate; but they\r\ncould not easily dismiss the terrible scenes enacted in San Domingo\r\nduring the years 1791 to 1793 and the three famous uprisings of\r\n1800, 1820 and 1831, in South Carolina and Virginia. The Underground\r\nRailroad had among its passengers such persons as Josiah Henson, J.\r\nW. Loguen, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, William Wells Brown\r\nand Henry Bibb; it therefore furnished the means of escape for\r\npersons well qualified for leadership among the slaves, and thereby\r\nlessened the danger of an uprising of the blacks against their\r\nmasters. The negro historian, Williams, has said of the Underground\r\nRoad that it served as a \"safety-valve to the institution of\r\nslavery. As soon as leaders arose among the slaves, who refused\r\nto endure the yoke, they would go North. Had they remained, there\r\nmust have been enacted at the South the direful scenes of San\r\nDomingo.\"[965]\r\n\r\n  [965] _History of the Negro Race in America_, Vol. II, pp. 58, 59.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to arrive at any satisfactory idea of the actual\r\nloss sustained by slave-owners through underground channels. The\r\ncharges of bad faith against the free states made in Congress by\r\nSouthern members were sometimes accompanied by estimates of the\r\namount of human property lost on account of the indisposition\r\nof those living north of Mason and Dixon's line to meet the\r\nrequirements of the fugitive slave legislation. Thus as early as\r\n1822, Moore, of Virginia, speaking in the House in favor of a new\r\nfugitive recovery law, said that the district he represented lost\r\nfour or five thousand dollars worth of runaway slaves annually.[966]\r\nIn August, 1850, Atchison, of Kentucky, informed the Senate that\r\n\"depredations to the amount of hundreds of thousands of dollars are\r\ncommitted upon the property of the people of the border slave states\r\nof this Union annually.\"[967] Pratt, of Maryland, said that not\r\nless than $80,000 worth of slaves was lost every year by citizens\r\nof his state.[968] Mason, of Virginia, declared that the losses\r\nof his state were already too heavy to be borne, that they were\r\nincreasing from year to year, and were then in excess of $100,000\r\nper year.[969] Butler, of South Carolina, reckoned the annual\r\nloss of the Southern section at $200,000.[970] Clingman, of North\r\nCarolina, said that the thirty thousand fugitives then reported to\r\nbe living in the North were worth at current prices little less\r\nthan $15,000,000.[971] Claiborne, the biographer of General John A.\r\nQuitman, who was at one time governor of Louisiana, indicated as one\r\nof the defects of the second Fugitive Slave Law its failure to make\r\n\"provision for the restitution to the South of the $30,000,000, of\r\nwhich she had been plundered through the 100,000 slaves abducted\r\nfrom her in the course of the last forty years\" (1810-1850);[972]\r\nand the same writer stated that slavery was rapidly disappearing\r\nfrom the District of Columbia at the time of the enactment of the\r\nnew law, the number of slaves \"having been reduced since 1840\r\nfrom 4,694 to 650, by 'underground railroads' and felonious\r\nabductions.\"[973]\r\n\r\n  [966] Benton's _Abridgment of the Debates of Congress_, Vol. VII,\r\n  p. 296.\r\n\r\n  [967] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress, First\r\n  Session, Appendix, p. 1601.\r\n\r\n  [968] _Ibid._, p. 1603.\r\n\r\n  [969] _Ibid._, p. 1605.\r\n\r\n  [970] Von Holst, _Constitutional and Political History of the\r\n  United States_, Vol. III, p. 552.\r\n\r\n  [971] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress, First\r\n  Session, p. 202.

Claiborne, _Life and Correspondence of John A.\r\n  Quitman_, Vol. II, p. 30. His figures are, of course, not correct.\r\n\r\nThe wide divergences among the estimates here given, as well as\r\nthe obvious difficulty of getting reliable information in regard\r\nto the number of runaway slaves, renders these figures of little\r\nuse in determining the loss of human property by the slaveholding\r\nstates. Nevertheless, the estimates are valuable in illustrating\r\nthe character of the complaints that were made in Congress, and\r\nin enabling one to realize that the tenure of slave property in\r\nthe border states was rendered precarious by the operations of\r\nthe Underground Railroad. Can it be thought strange that the\r\ndisappearance week by week and month by month of valuable slaves\r\nover the unknown routes of the underground system should have\r\nproduced wrath, suspicion and hostility in the minds of people who\r\ncould justly claim to have a constitutional guarantee, the laws of\r\nCongress, and the decisions of the highest courts on their side?\r\n\r\nIn the compendiums of the United States Census for 1850 and 1860\r\nare some statistics on fugitive slaves, which fall far short of the\r\nmost moderate estimates of the Southerners, and flatly disagree\r\nwith the testimony gathered from all other quarters. The official\r\nreports appear to show that the number of slaves escaping from their\r\nmasters was small and inconsiderable, that it rapidly decreased, and\r\nthat it was independent of proximity to a free population. But the\r\ncensuses are not only opposed to the evidence, they are on their\r\nface inadequate.\r\n\r\nIf, as those tables indicate, only 1,011 slaves escaped from their\r\nmasters in 1850, and only 803 in 1860, and in the latter year only\r\n500 escaped from the border slave states, then it becomes impossible\r\nto understand the emphasis laid by Southern men upon the value of\r\ntheir runaway slaves, the steady pressure made by the border states\r\nfor a more stringent law that resulted in the Fugitive Slave Act\r\nof 1850, and the allegation of bad faith on the part of the North\r\nput forth by the Southern states as a reason for secession.[974]\r\nIn considering the weight to be ascribed to the figures on fugitive\r\nslaves supplied by the census compendiums, it is proper to set\r\nover against them the showing afforded by the same compendiums\r\nrelative to the decline of the slave population in the border slave\r\nstates during the decade 1850-1860; for it is to be noted that the\r\ncompendiums show a marked decline in these states, that they show\r\na greater percentage of decline in the northernmost counties of\r\nthese states than in the states as a whole, and, what is even more\r\nremarkable, that the loss appears to have been still greater during\r\nthis time in the four \"pan-handle\" counties of Virginia than in any\r\nof the other states referred to, or in the border counties of any\r\none of them.[975] It can scarcely be suggested that the relatively\r\nrapid decline of the slave population in the border counties was due\r\nto larger shipments of slaves to the far South from these marginal\r\nregions without at the same time suggesting that the explanation\r\nfor such shipments lay in the proximity of a free population and\r\nthe numerous lines of Underground Railroad maintained by it. The\r\nconcurrence of evidence from sources other than the census reports,\r\nand the agreement therewith of part of the evidence gathered from\r\nthese reports themselves, constrains one to say that those who\r\ncompiled the statistics on fugitive slaves did not secure the facts\r\nin full; and that the complaints of large losses sustained by\r\nslave-owners through the befriending of fugitive slaves by Northern\r\npeople, frequently made by Southern representatives in Congress and\r\nby the South generally, were not without sufficient foundation.\r\n\r\n  [974] Census of 1860, pp. 11, 12. See Table A, Appendix C, p. 378.\r\n\r\n  [975] See Tables B and C, Appendix C, p. 379.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that there should be great variation among the guesses\r\nmade as to the total number of those indebted for liberty to the\r\nUnderground Road. Very few of the persons that harbored runaways\r\nwere so indiscreet as to keep a register of their hunted visitors.\r\nTheir hospitality was equal to all possible demands, but was kept\r\nstrictly secret. Under these circumstances one should handle all\r\nnumerical generalizations with caution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECORD OF FUGITIVES AIDED DURING FIVE MONTHS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KEPT BY DANIEL OSBORN, OF ALUM CREEK SETTLEMENT,\r\nOHIO.]\r\n\r\nBy rare good fortune the writer has found a single leaf of a diary\r\nkept by Daniel Osborn, a Friend or Quaker, of Alum Creek Settlement,\r\nDelaware County, Ohio, which gives a record of the blacks passing\r\nthrough that neighborhood during an interval of five months, from\r\nApril 14 to September 10, 1844. The accompanying facsimiles,\r\nwhich reproduce the two sides of the leaf, show that the number\r\nis forty-seven. The year in which this memorandum was made may be\r\nfairly taken as an average year, and the line on which this Quaker\r\nsettlement was a station as a representative underground route in\r\nOhio. Now, along Ohio's southern boundary there were the initial\r\nstations of at least twelve important lines of travel, some of which\r\nwere certainly in operation before 1830. Let us consider, as we may\r\nproperly, that the period of operation continued from 1830 to 1860.\r\nTaking these as the elements for a computation, one may reckon that\r\nOhio may have aided not less than 40,000 fugitives in the thirty\r\nyears included in our reckoning.[976] That the number of refugees\r\nafter 1844 did not decrease is indicated by the statement that\r\nduring one month in the year of 1854-1855 sixty were harbored by one\r\nmember of the Alum Creek Settlement. It is to be remembered that\r\nseveral families of the settlement were engaged in this work.[977]\r\n\r\n  [976] This computation was first printed by the writer in the\r\n  _American Historical Review_, April, 1896, pp. 462, 463.\r\n\r\n  [977] Conversation with M. J. Benedict, L. A. Benedict and\r\n  others, Alum Creek Settlement, Ohio, Dec. 2, 1893.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of underground activity in the East may be ventured.\r\nMr. Robert Purvis, of Philadelphia, states that he kept a record\r\nof the fugitives that passed through the hands of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee of Philadelphia for a long period, till the trepidation\r\nof his family after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Bill in 1850\r\ncaused him to destroy it. His record book showed, he says, an\r\naverage of one a day sent northward. In other words, between 1830\r\nand 1860 over 9,000 runaways were aided in Philadelphia. But we\r\nknow that the Vigilance Committee did not begin this sort of work\r\nin the Quaker City, and that underground activities there date back\r\nat least to the time of Isaac T. Hopper's earliest efforts, that\r\nis, 1800 and before. We also know that there were many centres\r\nround about Philadelphia, some of whose work was certainly done\r\nindependently of that place.\r\n\r\nThat the resources of some of the operators in centres in the West\r\nwere being drained almost to exhaustion by the demands of the heavy\r\ntraffic towards the close of the underground period, distinctly\r\nappears in the following letter from Col. J. Bowles, of Lawrence,\r\nKansas, to Mr. F. B. Sanborn:--\r\n\r\n  LAWRENCE _April 4th 1859_\r\n\r\n     MR. F. B. SANBOURN\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir at the suggestion of friend Judge Conway I address you\r\n     these few hastily written lines. I see I am expected to give\r\n     you some information as to the present condition of the _U. G.\r\n     R. R._ in Kansas or more particularly at the Lawrence depot. In\r\n     order that you may fully understand the present condition of\r\n     affairs I shall ask your permission to relate a small bit of the\r\n     early history of this, the only _paying_, R. R. in Kansas.\r\n\r\n     Lawrence has been (from the first settlement of Kansas) known\r\n     and cursed by all slave holders in and out of Mo. for being\r\n     an abolition town. Missourians have a peculiar faculty for\r\n     embracing every opportunity to denounce, curse, and _blow_\r\n     every thing they dislike. This peculiar faculty of theirs gave\r\n     Lawrence great notoriety in _Mo._ especially among the negroes\r\n     to whom the principal part of their denunciations were directed\r\n     and on whom they were intended to have great effect. I have\r\n     learned from negroes who were _emigrating_ from _Mo._ that they\r\n     never would have known anything about a land of freedom or\r\n     that they had a friend in the world only from their master's\r\n     continual abuse of the Lawrence abolits. Slaves are usually very\r\n     cunning and believe about as much as they please of what the\r\n     master is telling him (thoug of course he must affect to believe\r\n     every word) knowing it is to the master's interest to keep him\r\n     ignorant of every thing that would make him likely or even wish\r\n     to be free.\r\n\r\n     One old fellow said \"when he started to come to Lawrence he\r\n     didn't know if all de peoples in disha town war debbils as ole\r\n     massa had said or not, but dis he did know if he could get dar\r\n     safe old massa was fraid to come arter him, and if dey all\r\n     should prove to be bad as ole massa had said he could lib wid\r\n     dem bout as well as at home.\" Some few of them were unavoidably\r\n     taken back to Mo. after leaving here for Iowa. Many of them\r\n     found an opportunity to make their escape and bring others with\r\n     them and none ever failed to be a successful missionary in the\r\n     cause, telling every one he had a chance to converse with of\r\n     the land of freedom, and the friends he found in Lawrence. One\r\n     man I know well who has been captured twice and was shot each\r\n     time in resisting his captors (one of whom he killed) told me\r\n     that he was confident he had assisted in the escape of no less\r\n     than twenty five of his fellow beings, and that he had also\r\n     given information or sown the seed that would make a hundred\r\n     more free men. He is now with some others in or about Canada.\r\n     The last and successful escape was made from western Texas\r\n     where he was sent for safe keeping. You can see from the above\r\n     why L---- has had more than would seem to be her share of this\r\n     good work to do. At first our means were limited and of course\r\n     could not do much but then we were not so extensively known or\r\n     patronized. As our means increased we found a corresponding\r\n     increase in opportunity for doing good to the white man as well\r\n     as the black. Kansas has been preëminently a land of charity.\r\n     The friends in the East have helped such objects liberally yet\r\n     Kansas has had much to do for herself in that line. To give you\r\n     an idea of what has been done by the people of this place in\r\n     U. G. R. R. I'll make a statement of the number of fugitives\r\n     who have found assistance here. In the last four years I am\r\n     personally known to [cognizant of] the fact of nearly three\r\n     hundred fugitives having passed through and received assistance\r\n     from the abolitionists here at Lawrence. Thus you see we have\r\n     been continually strained to meet the heavy demands that were\r\n     almost daily made upon us to carry on this (not very) _gradual\r\n     emancipation_. I usually have assisted in collecting or begging\r\n     money for the needy of either class. Many of the most zealous\r\n     in the cause of humanity complained (as they had good cause to)\r\n     that this heavy (and continually increasing) tax was interfering\r\n     with their business to such a degree that they could not stand\r\n     it longer and that other provisions must be made by which they\r\n     would be relieved of a portion of a burden they had long bourn.\r\n     This was about the state of affairs last Christmas when as you\r\n     are aware the slaves have a few days holiday. Many of them chose\r\n     this occasion to make a visit to Lawrence and during the week\r\n     some twenty four came to our town, five or six of the number\r\n     brought means to assist them on their journey. These were sent\r\n     on, but the remainder must be kept until money could be raised\r\n     to send them on. $150 was the am't necessary to send them to\r\n     a place of safety. Under the circumstances it necessarily took\r\n     some time to raise that am't, and a great many persons had to be\r\n     applied to. It was not enough that the sympathies and love for\r\n     the cause of humanity was appealed to in order to raise money,\r\n     many had to be argued with and shown that the cause was actually\r\n     in a suffering condition and the fugitives were then in town\r\n     and the number must also be made known in order that the person\r\n     might give liberally. Lawrence like most all towns has her bad\r\n     men pimps and worst of all a few democrats, all of whom will do\r\n     _anything_ for money. Somewhere in the ranks of the intimate\r\n     friends to the cause these traitors to God and humanity found a\r\n     judas who for thirty pieces of silver did betray our cause. This\r\n     was not suspected until after the capture of Dr Day.... Every\r\n     thing goes to prove that the capture of Day's party was the work\r\n     of a traitor who though suspected has not yet been fairly tried\r\n     and _dealt_ with as will be done as soon as Day is bailed out\r\n     which will be done [in] a few days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     We would like ... that you plead our cause with those of our\r\n     friends who are disposed to censure us and convince them we are\r\n     still worthy and in great need of their respect and coöperation.\r\n     I am sorry to say (but tis true) that many of the most zealous\r\n     in the cause of humanity have become somewhat discouraged by\r\n     the hard times and the lamentable capture of Day and party and\r\n     cannot be induced to take hold of it and lend a willing hand.\r\n     Never the less the work has went slowly but surely on, until\r\n     very recently. Those who have persevered like many others, have\r\n     found _their_ bottom dollar also of the money so generously\r\n     contributed by persons of your notable society. This is partialy\r\n     owing to heavy expenses of the trial of Dr Day and son which has\r\n     been principally borne by the society here and has amounted to\r\n     near $300. Now seems to be our dark day and we are casting about\r\n     to see what can be done. We have some eight or ten fugitives\r\n     now on hand who cannot be sent off until we get an addition\r\n     to our financial department. This statement of facts has been\r\n     made with a full knowledge of the many calls that is made upon\r\n     your generosity in that quarter. Nothing shall be urged as an\r\n     alternative for we feel confident the case here presented will\r\n     meet with merited assistance sympathy or advice, as you may deem\r\n     best. One word of old Brown and his movement in the emancipation\r\n     cause, and I will have done. I understand from some parties who\r\n     have been corresponding with some persons in Boston and other\r\n     places in behalf of our cause that we could and would receive\r\n     material aid only they are holding themselves in readiness to\r\n     assist Brown. Such men I honor and they show themselves worthy\r\n     the highest regard yet I assure them they do not understand\r\n     Brown's plans for carrying out his cause. I have known Brown\r\n     nearly four years, he is a bold cool calculating and far seeing\r\n     man who is as consciencious as he is smart. He \"knows the right\r\n     and dare maintain it.\" I have talked confidentially with him\r\n     on the subject. I know he expressed himself in this way as to\r\n     the effects that he intended to make the master pay the way of\r\n     the slave to the land of freedom. That is he intended to take\r\n     property enough with the slaves to pay all expenses. So you see\r\n     there is not fear of a large demand from that quarter. By no\r\n     means would I be understood as counciling not to assist him. No\r\n     indeed if I counciled at all it would be to this effect, render\r\n     him all the assistance he ever asks for he is worthy and his\r\n     cause is a good one. _Others_ would have been with him only they\r\n     had all they could do in another quarter. I feel myself highly\r\n     honored to be placed where I can with propriety communicate\r\n     with a society whom I have only known to admire. Hoping what I\r\n     have written (disconnectedly and badly written as it is) may\r\n     be acceptable and that I may hear from you soon. I am very\r\n     respectfully Your obedient servant\r\n\r\n  J. BOWLES\r\n  Lawrence\r\n\r\n  F. B. SANBOURN\r\n  Concord.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Underground Road in transporting negroes beyond\r\nthe limits of the Southern states was long ago commented upon as\r\nstanding in marked contrast with that of the American Colonization\r\nSociety. This association was organized in 1816, and soon had\r\nauxiliary societies in most of the states. Its object was to remove\r\nthe free blacks and such as might be made free from the South, and\r\ncolonize them on the coast of Africa. By 1857, after an existence\r\nof forty years, the Colonization Society had sent to Africa 9,502\r\nemigrants, of whom 3,676 were free-born, 326 self-purchased, and\r\n5,500 emancipated on condition of being transported. That the\r\ninformal method of the abolitionists was many times as efficient as\r\nthat adopted by the organization mentioned, with its treasury and\r\nits board of officers, cannot be denied.[978]\r\n\r\n  [978] E. M. Pettit, _Sketches in the History of the Underground\r\n  Railroad_, Introduction, p. xi. Wilson gives an account of the\r\n  American Colonization Society in his _Rise and Fall of the Slave\r\n  Power_, Vol. I, pp. 208-222; see also the _Life of Garrison_, by\r\n  his children, Index.\r\n\r\nBy actual count it is found that the number of persons within the\r\nlimits of Ohio named as underground workers in the collections upon\r\nwhich this book is based, is about 1,540; in all other states taken\r\ntogether the number found is 1,670. It is proper to observe that\r\nthese figures are minimum figures. Death and infirmity, as well as\r\nremoval, have carried many unknown operators beyond the chance of\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the secret enterprises of this determined\r\nclass of people--so effectual as to make rare the pursuit of\r\na fugitive during the last years of the decade preceding the\r\nWar[979]--should have become the ground of an important charge\r\nagainst the North in the crisis of 1860. The violation of the\r\nFugitive Slave Law was an accusation upon which Southern members of\r\nCongress rang all the changes in the course of the violent debates\r\nof the sessions of 1860-1861. Thus Jones, of Georgia, said in the\r\nHouse in April, 1860: \"It is a notorious fact that in a good many\r\nof the non-slaveholding states the Republican party have regularly\r\norganized societies--underground railroads--for the avowed purpose\r\nof stealing the slaves from the border States, and carrying them\r\noff to a free State or to Canada. These predatory bands are kept\r\nup by private and public subscriptions among the Abolitionists;\r\nand in many of the States, I am sorry to say, they receive the\r\nsanction and protection of the law. The border States lose annually\r\nthousands and millions of dollars' worth of property by this\r\nsystem of larceny that has been carried on for years.\" Polk, of\r\nMissouri, whose state had suffered not a little through the flight\r\nand abduction of slaves, made the same complaint in the Senate in\r\nJanuary, 1861: \"Underground railroads are established,\" said he,\r\n\"stretching from the remotest slaveholding States clear up to\r\nCanada. Secret agencies are put to work in the very midst of our\r\nslaveholding communities to steal away slaves. The constitutional\r\nobligation for the rendition of the fugitive from service is\r\nviolated. The laws of Congress enacted to carry this provision of\r\nthe Constitution into effect are not executed. Their execution is\r\nprevented. Prevented, first, by hostile and unconstitutional state\r\nlegislation. Secondly, by a vitiated public sentiment. Thirdly, by\r\nthe concealing of the slave, so that the United States law cannot\r\nbe made to reach him. And when the runaway is arrested under the\r\nfugitive slave law--which, however, is seldom the case--he is very\r\noften rescued.... This lawlessness is felt with special seriousness\r\nin the border slave States. The underground railroads start mostly\r\nfrom these States. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are lost\r\nannually. And no State loses more heavily than my own. Kentucky, it\r\nis estimated, loses annually as much as $200,000. The other border\r\nStates no doubt lose in the same ratio, Missouri much more. But all\r\nthese losses and outrages, all this disregard of constitutional\r\nobligation and social duty, are as nothing in their bearing upon the\r\nUnion in comparison with the animus, the intent and purpose of which\r\nthey are at once the fruit and the evidence....\"[980] Of this animus\r\nthe election of Lincoln was regarded as the crowning proof; and it\r\nbecame, as is well known, the signal for secession.\r\n\r\n  [979] McDougall, _Fugitive Slaves_, p. 71.\r\n\r\n  [980] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-sixth Congress, Second\r\n  Session, p. 356; see also _ibid._, Appendix, p. 197.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1860, the very month in which South Carolina chose to\r\nwithdraw from the Union, the arrest of a runaway negro in Canada\r\ngave rise to an extradition case that became an additional cause\r\nof excitement. The negro was William Anderson, who in 1853 had\r\nbeen caught without a pass in Missouri, and had killed the man\r\nthat tried to capture him. In 1860 he was recognized in Canada\r\nby a slave-catcher from Missouri, was arrested on the charge of\r\nmurder, and thrown into jail at Toronto. As the Ashburton treaty\r\ncontained an article providing for the extradition of slaves guilty\r\nof crimes committed in the United States, the American government\r\nsought to secure the surrender of Anderson for punishment. Lord\r\nElgin, Governor-General of Canada at the time, was appealed to\r\nin the fugitive's behalf by Mrs. Laura S. Haviland. He made a\r\nspirited reply to the effect that \"in case of a demand for William\r\nAnderson, he should require the case to be tried in their British\r\ncourt; and if twelve freeholders should testify that he had been\r\na man of integrity since his arrival in their dominion, it should\r\nclear him.\" Nevertheless, the case was twice decided against the\r\ndefendant, first by the common magistrate's court, then by the Court\r\nof Error and Appeal, to which it had been carried on a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus. But this did not end the matter. Through the efforts\r\nof the fugitive's friends application was made for a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus to the English Court of the Queen's Bench, and the writ was\r\ngranted. Anderson was defended by Gerrit Smith, whose eloquent\r\nspeech produced a profound impression in Canada, and did not fail to\r\nattract considerable notice in all parts of the United States.[981]\r\n\r\n  [981] Accounts of Anderson's case will be found in a collection\r\n  of pamphlets in the Boston Public Library; in the _Liberator_,\r\n  Dec. 3, 1860 and Jan. 22, 1861; in _A Woman's Life Work_, by\r\n  Laura S. Haviland, pp. 207, 208; in the _History of Canada_, by\r\n  J. M. McMullen, Vol. II, p. 259; in the _History of Canada_,\r\n  by John MacMullen, p. 553; and in _Fugitive Slaves_, by M. G.\r\n  McDougall, pp. 25, 26.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of December, in which the Anderson case came\r\ninto prominence, the example of secession set by South Carolina\r\nwas followed by five other cotton states. Meantime Congress was\r\ngiving unmistakable evidence of the importance attaching to the\r\nfugitive slave question. In his message of December 4, President\r\nBuchanan gave serious consideration to this question, although he\r\ninsisted that the Fugitive Slave Law had been duly enforced in every\r\ncontested case during his administration.[982] He recommended an\r\n\"explanatory amendment\" to the Constitution affording \"recognition\r\nof the right of the master to have his slave who has escaped from\r\none state to another restored and 'delivered up' to him, and of\r\nthe validity of the Fugitive Slave Law enacted for this purpose,\r\ntogether with a declaration that all State laws impairing or\r\ndefeating this right, are violations of the Constitution, and\r\nare consequently null and void.\"[983] On December 12 not less\r\nthan eleven resolutions were introduced into the House on this\r\nsubject, and on December 13, 18 and 24 other resolutions followed.\r\nResolutions of a similar nature continued to be presented in both\r\nHouses during January and February of the succeeding year, ceasing\r\nonly with the end of the session.[984]\r\n\r\n  [982] _Journal of the Senate_, Thirty-sixth Congress, Second\r\n  Session, p. 10.\r\n\r\n  [983] _Journal of the Senate_, Thirty-sixth Congress, Second\r\n  Session, p. 18.\r\n\r\n  [984] For a complete list of these resolutions see Mrs.\r\n  McDougall's monograph on _Fugitive Slaves_, Appendix, pp. 117-119.\r\n\r\nThese efforts on the part of the national legislature to appease the\r\nspirit of secession in the South were paralleled by efforts equally\r\nfutile on the part of various Northern state legislatures during\r\nthe same period. It was reported that towards the close of the year\r\n1860 a caucus of governors of seven Republican states was held in\r\nNew York City, and decided to recommend to their legislatures \"the\r\nunconditional and early repeal of the personal liberty bills passed\r\nby their respective states.\" As a matter of fact this recommendation\r\nwas made by the Republican governors of four states, Maine,\r\nMassachusetts, New York and Illinois, and the Democratic governors\r\nof Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. Rhode Island repealed her\r\npersonal liberty law in January, 1861; Massachusetts modified hers\r\nin March; and was followed by Vermont, which took similar action\r\nin April. Ohio had repealed her act in 1858, but her legislature\r\nseized this opportunity to urge her sister states to cancel any of\r\ntheir statutes \"conflicting with or rendering less efficient the\r\nConstitution or the laws.\"[985] The conciliation of the South was\r\nclearly the purpose of these measures, but action came too late, for\r\nconfidence between the sections had already been destroyed.\r\n\r\n  [985] Rhodes, _History of the United States_, Vol. III, pp. 252,\r\n  253.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the border slave states, with the exception of\r\nVirginia, remained in the Union, must not be interpreted as\r\nindicating small losses of human property by these states. The\r\nstrong ties existing between the states lying on either side of\r\nthe sectional line, the presence of a rigorous Union sentiment in\r\nKentucky, western Virginia and the slaveholding regions lying east\r\nand west of these, together with the hope of a new compromise\r\nentertained by these states, tended to keep them in their places\r\nin the Union. The prospect of a stampede of slaves, in case they\r\nshould join the secession movement, was a consideration that may\r\nbe supposed to have had some weight in fixing the decision of\r\nthe border slave states. Certainly it was one to which Northern\r\nmen attached considerable importance at the time in explaining\r\nthe steadfast position of these states; and the impossibility of\r\nrecovering even a single fugitive from the free states in case of a\r\ndisruption of the Union along Mason and Dixon's line was a thing of\r\nwhich Southern members of the national House were duly reminded by\r\ntheir Northern colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe retention of the loyalty of the border slave states was a\r\nmatter of grave concern to President Lincoln, who sought first of\r\nall the preservation of the Union. In his inaugural address Lincoln\r\nhad declared his purpose to see to it that the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nwas executed, and when a few months later an opportunity presented\r\nitself he kept his promise. Congress also realized the need of\r\ncaution on account of the border states, and moved slowly in framing\r\ngeneral enactments. The changed conditions surrounding the slaves,\r\ndue to the marshalling of forces for the War and the advance of\r\nNorthern troops into the enemy's country, multiplied the chances\r\nfor escape throughout the South, and removed the necessity for a\r\nlong and perilous journey by the slaves to find friends. Negroes\r\nfrom the plantations of both loyal and disloyal masters flocked to\r\nthe camps of Union soldiers, and could not be separated. Under such\r\ncircumstances the need of uniformity of method in dealing with cases\r\nearly became apparent. The War had scarcely more than commenced\r\nwhen protests began to be made against the employment of Northern\r\ntroops as slave-catchers. A letter read in the Senate by Mr. Sumner,\r\nin December, 1861, made inquiry, \"Shall our sons, who are offering\r\ntheir lives for the preservation of our institutions, be degraded\r\nto slave-catchers for any persons, loyal or disloyal? If such is\r\nthe policy of the government, I shall urge my son to shed no more\r\nblood for its preservation.\"[986] Two German companies in one of the\r\nMassachusetts regiments also entered protest, making it a condition\r\nof their enlistment that they should not be required to perform such\r\ndiscreditable service. \"They complained, and with them the German\r\npopulation generally throughout the country.\"[987] The inexpediency\r\nof the return of fugitives by the army was recognized by Congress\r\nin the early part of 1862, and a bill forbidding officers from\r\nrestoring them under any consideration was signed by the President\r\non May 14, 1862.[988]\r\n\r\n  [986] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-seventh Congress, First\r\n  Session, p. 30.\r\n\r\n  [987] _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-seventh Congress, First\r\n  Session, p. 30; see also M. G. McDougall's _Fugitive Slaves_, p.\r\n  79.\r\n\r\n  [988] _House Journal_, Thirty-seventh Congress, Second Session,\r\n  p. 265; _Senate Journal_, Thirty-seventh Congress, Second\r\n  Session, p. 285; _Congressional Globe_, Thirty-seventh Congress,\r\n  Second Session, p. 1243.\r\n\r\nThe various acts of Congress and the President relative to fugitive\r\nslaves down to the Proclamation of Emancipation, practically\r\ncircumscribed the legal effect of the Fugitive Slave laws to the\r\nborder states, for in the free states the laws had not been observed\r\nfor a long time. It was not until June, 1864, that these measures\r\nwere swept from the statute-book of the nation, notwithstanding the\r\ninsistence of Kentucky and the other loyal states of the South that\r\na constitutional obligation rested upon the government to retain\r\nthem. The repeal act did not remove this obligation. Such a result\r\ncould come only with the extinction of slavery, and the last vestige\r\nof slavery did not disappear until the adoption of the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution in 1865. The Amendment provides:\r\n\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment\r\nfor crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall\r\nexist within the United States or any place subject to their\r\njurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nThe general significance of the long controversy in regard to\r\nfugitive slaves can best be understood by tracing the development\r\nas a sectional issue of the question at the bottom of it, namely,\r\nthe obligation to restore fugitives to their masters. The creation\r\nof a line dividing the free North from the slaveholding South in\r\nthe early years of our national history, and the enactment of the\r\nfirst Fugitive Slave Law, by which the general government assumed\r\na certain responsibility for runaways, led to the opening of the\r\nquestion. From that time on, the steadily increasing number of\r\nescapes, together with the spread of the underground system,\r\nwhich made these escapes almost uniformly successful, kept the\r\nquestion open. Operations along the secret lines constantly caused\r\naggravation in the South; and the pursuit of passengers, mobs and\r\nviolence were results widely witnessed in the North. The other\r\nquestions between the sections were subject to compromise, but party\r\naction could not control the workings of the Underground Railroad.\r\nThe stirring sights and affecting stories with which the North\r\nbecame acquainted through the stealthy migration of slaves were well\r\nadapted to make abolitionists rapidly, and the consequence was more\r\naggravation on both sides. The practice of midnight emancipation\r\nin Northern states during the early years was accompanied, not\r\nunnaturally, with the formulation and statement of the principle\r\nof immediatism in neighborhoods where underground methods were\r\nfamiliar. Thus the way was prepared for Garrison and his talented\r\ncoworkers, whose eloquent tongues and pens could no more be\r\ncontrolled by pro-slavery forces than could the Underground Railroad\r\nitself. Agitation reacted upon the Road and increased its activity;\r\nthis caused counter agitation by Southerners in and out of Congress\r\nuntil a more rigorous Fugitive Slave Law was secured.\r\n\r\nThe Compromise of 1850 failed to reconcile the sections: Northern\r\nmen despised the Fugitive Slave Law, and displayed greater zeal than\r\never before in aiding runaway slaves. Thus, in the later stages\r\nof the controversy, as from its beginning, the fugitive was a\r\nsuccessful missionary in the cause of freedom. Personal liberty laws\r\nwere passed by the free states to defend him; _Uncle Tom's Cabin_\r\nwas written to portray to the world his aspirations for liberty and\r\nhis endeavors to secure it; John Brown devised a \"subterranean pass\r\nway\" to assist him, as a part of the great scheme of liberation that\r\nfailed at Harper's Ferry. One of the chief reasons for withdrawing\r\nfrom the Union assigned by the seceding states was the bad faith\r\nof the North in refusing to surrender fugitives. At the outbreak\r\nof the Civil War large numbers of slaves sought refuge with the\r\nUnion forces, the government soon found it impracticable to restore\r\nthem, and disavowed all responsibility for them in 1862. By the\r\nProclamation of Emancipation slavery was abolished within the area\r\nof the disloyal states, and the controversy became merely formal,\r\nthe loyal slave states striving to maintain an abstract right based\r\nby them upon the Constitution. In 1864, however, they were forced\r\nto yield, and the fugitive slave legislation was repealed. The year\r\nfollowing witnessed the cancellation of the fugitive slave clause in\r\nthe Constitution by the amendment of that instrument. In view of all\r\nthis it is safe to say that the Underground Railroad was one of the\r\ngreatest forces which brought on the Civil War, and thus destroyed\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND NATIONAL ACTS RELATIVE TO FUGITIVE\r\nSLAVES, 1787-1850\r\n\r\n\r\nFugitive Clause in Northwest Ordinance of 1787.

UNPUBLISHED REMINISCENCES\r\n\r\nThe materials upon which in large measure this book is based are\r\nreminiscences gathered by correspondence and conversation with more\r\nthan a thousand persons, many of whom were old-time abolitionists,\r\nwhile the remainder included the families and intimate friends of\r\nabolitionists, and a number of fugitive slaves. It was discovered\r\nby the author after only a short search for published sources that\r\nlittle was to be gleaned in the libraries and that information\r\nsufficient in amount for an extended study could be obtained only\r\nby what geologists and botanists call field-work. The collection of\r\nmaterials went on as time could be spared for this purpose until\r\na great mass of letters and notes had been brought together, and\r\nthen the work of sorting, arranging and classifying began. The\r\nreminiscences were grouped by states and counties, so as to bring\r\nout as far as possible the coincident and confirmatory character\r\nof evidence relating to the same neighborhood or district; and the\r\nvalue of the materials appeared in the tracings of underground\r\nlines the author was able to make, county by county and state\r\nby state, throughout the region of the free states from Iowa to\r\nMaine. For the purpose of showing the extent and importance of the\r\nunderground movement these unpublished reminiscences have proved to\r\nbe invaluable.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PRINTED COLLECTIONS OF UNDERGROUND RAILROAD INCIDENTS\r\n\r\nThere are a few volumes that supply us with numerous illustrations\r\nof the Underground Railroad in operation. These books are not\r\ngeneral treatises on the underground system, but give us an insight\r\ninto the clandestine work of several limited localities; they are\r\nimportant because they exhibit the methods and devices of operators,\r\nshow the sacrifices made by them in behalf of the midnight seekers\r\nafter liberty, and supplement with valuable matter the unpublished\r\nreminiscences. In addition to the well-known books of Still, Smedley\r\nand Coffin, the author has found the three smaller, and hitherto\r\nunquoted books by W. M. Mitchell, E. M. Pettit and H. U. Johnson, to\r\nbe useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nA few of those who were active in aiding slaves to escape to Canada\r\nhave published volumes of personal recollections, in which, among\r\nother things, they tell more or less about their connection with\r\nthe humane but illegitimate work of the abolitionists, and give\r\nvivid sketches of some of their associates, as well as of some\r\nof their dark-skinned protégés. Such books are the Rev. James\r\nFreeman Clarke's _Anti-Slavery Days_, the Rev. Samuel J. May's\r\n_Recollections of our Anti-Slavery Conflict_, J. B. Grinnell's _Men\r\nand Events of Forty Years_, Mrs. Laura S. Haviland's _A Woman's Life\r\nWork_ and Mrs. E. B. Chace's _Anti-Slavery Reminiscences_.\r\n\r\nA small class of books, of which the _Personal Memoirs_ of Daniel\r\nDrayton, and the books by Dr. A. M. Ross and the Rev. Calvin\r\nFairbank are representatives, are indispensable as sources of\r\ninformation relating to the abduction of slaves from the South.\r\nThe little book entitled _Harriet, the Moses of her People_, in\r\nwhich that remarkable guide of fugitives, Harriet Tubman, relates\r\nher exploits through the pen of her friend, Mrs. S. H. Bradford,\r\nproperly belongs to this group.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. LETTERS, DIARIES AND SCRAP-BOOKS\r\n\r\nThe liability of Underground Railroad operators to severe penalties\r\nfor harboring runaways explains the dearth of evidence in the form\r\nof letters, diaries and scrap-books they have left behind; such\r\nevidence would have been incriminating. It is known that a few\r\nabolitionists kept diaries and scrap-books and even wrote letters\r\nin regard to the business of the Road, but most of these records\r\nappear to have been destroyed before the beginning of the Civil\r\nWar. The author has been able to secure only two or three letters\r\nand the single leaf of a diary in centres where much work was\r\ndone. Three scrap-books in the Boston Public Library, containing\r\nmemoranda, clippings, handbills, etc., that refer in particular to\r\nthe experiences of Theodore Parker, shed much light on the work of\r\nthe Vigilance Committee of Boston, and supply important information\r\nin regard to the famous case of Anthony Burns.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. BIOGRAPHIES AND MEMOIRS\r\n\r\nBiographies and memoirs of anti-slavery men not infrequently contain\r\nreferences to aid rendered to fugitives, explain the motives of the\r\nphilanthropists, and give their versions of the fugitive slave cases\r\nthat came within their immediate knowledge; such books are often\r\nindices of the public sentiment of the localities in which their\r\nsubjects lived, and when read in conjunction with the biographies\r\nof pro-slavery advocates help us to realize the conflicting\r\ninterests that expressed themselves in the slavery controversy.\r\nLydia Maria Child's _Life of Isaac T. Hopper_ has preserved to us\r\nthe record of one of the pioneers of the underground movement, while\r\nthe biographies of _Gerrit Smith_ and _James and Lucretia Mott_,\r\nshow these persons to have been worthy successors of the benign\r\nand shrewd Hopper. In the biographies of John Brown by Redpath,\r\nHinton and Sanborn, and in the _Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe_, by\r\nher son, Charles E. Stowe, we have proofs of the deep and enduring\r\nimpression made by underground experiences upon strong characters\r\ncapable of assimilating and transforming these into forces of\r\nhistorical moment. Chase, Seward and Sumner were among our public\r\nmen who acted as counsel for fugitive slaves; it is not surprising\r\ntherefore that their biographers have given considerable space to\r\nthe consideration of cases with which these men were connected. The\r\nprominence of the statesmen just named and others of their class\r\nas party leaders makes their biographies indispensable in tracing\r\nthe political history of the ante-bellum period. Claiborne's _Life\r\nand Correspondence of John A. Quitman_ may properly be named as\r\nan excellent and valuable example of the class of biographies of\r\nprominent men of the South.\r\n\r\nA few obituary pamphlets have been gathered, which have proved to\r\nbe of some service: such are A. L. Benedict's _Memoir of Richard\r\nDillingham_, and pamphlets relating to Mr. John Hossack, of Ottawa,\r\nIllinois, and Mr. James M. Westwater, of Columbus, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. SLAVE BIOGRAPHIES AND AUTOBIOGRAPHIES\r\n\r\nA recital of the life and sufferings of many colored refugees\r\nin books written by themselves or by sympathetic friends, and\r\npublished in various free states during the two or three decades\r\npreceding 1860, tended to increase the Northern feeling against\r\nslavery and doubtless also to carry to many minds convictions that\r\nfound a partial expression in underground efforts. These books\r\ncontain descriptions of slave life on the plantation and tell with\r\nthe omission of particulars, which it would have been imprudent\r\nat the time to relate, the story of the escape to liberty. The\r\nomission of these particulars renders these sources of little use\r\nin tracing the secret routes to Canada followed by the refugees, or\r\nin confirming, in part or in whole, the routes of others. In the\r\ncase of Frederick Douglass, the gaps and omissions appearing in the\r\nfirst autobiography are filled with much valuable information in the\r\nsecond, written after slavery was abolished. The books by Josiah\r\nHenson, the Rev. J. W. Loguen and Austin Steward are interesting as\r\nthe narratives of negroes of superior ability who spent a part at\r\nleast of their time after self-emancipation in Canada, and could\r\ntherefore write intelligently on the condition of their people\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. MATERIALS RELATING TO SLAVERY AND FUGITIVE SLAVES IN CANADA\r\n\r\nThere is but little material in regard to slavery and fugitive\r\nslaves in Canada. The question of slavery in the provinces is\r\nclearly presented in a few pages of Vol. XXV of the _Magazine of\r\nAmerican History_, while the life of the colored refugees in Canada\r\nduring the period of immigration and settlement can only be seen in\r\nanything like a sufficient light in Benjamin Drew's _North-Side View\r\nof Slavery_, and Dr. S. G. Howe's _Refugees from Slavery in Canada\r\nWest_.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. STATE, COUNTY AND LOCAL HISTORIES\r\n\r\nMany contributions on the Underground Railroad appear in the\r\ncollections of historical, biographical and other materials that\r\nmake up a large number of our state, county and local histories\r\nso-called. Accounts, which when taken by themselves are fragmentary\r\nand therefore of little importance, have been brought to light by\r\nsearching through these histories; and not unnaturally, perhaps,\r\nthe largest number have been found in the county histories of Ohio.\r\nSix or seven of these histories afford articles relating to the\r\nUnderground Railroad; and characteristic items and incidents have\r\nbeen printed in both state and local histories besides. Illinois\r\ncomes next in the number of contributions preserved in its local\r\nhistories. The utmost diligence of the student in the library\r\nalcoves devoted to Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York,\r\nPennsylvania and Wisconsin, will result in the finding of from one\r\nto three contributions only, as the case may be; while from the\r\nshelves given to Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New Jersey, he is\r\nnot likely to secure anything to his purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. REPORTS OF SOCIETIES\r\n\r\nThe reports of anti-slavery societies, especially those of\r\nMassachusetts and Pennsylvania, are rich in comments upon the\r\nprosecutions in the South of abductors of slaves, and do not fail to\r\nshow the effect of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 upon the activity\r\nof Underground Railroad lines. They also tell something of the\r\nmissionary work done among the refugees in Canada. In the last-named\r\nrespect they are secondary to the _Reports of the Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety of Canada_, _the Refugees' Home Society_, and the _Canada\r\nMission_.\r\n\r\nWithin the past ten years various societies of the historical type\r\nhave been instrumental, directly or indirectly, in the publication\r\nof addresses bearing upon the violation of the Fugitive Slave laws.\r\nA series of lectures before the Political Science Association of\r\nthe University of Michigan, several of which involve this theme,\r\nwere published in 1889 under the general title, _Constitutional\r\nHistory of the United States as seen in the Development of American\r\nLaw_. A collection of letters and addresses commemorative of the\r\nanti-slavery movement and some of its leaders was printed in 1893\r\nin a book, called _Old Anti-Slavery Days_, by the Danvers (Mass.)\r\nHistorical Society. An address on \"The Underground Railroad\" by\r\nex-President James H. Fairchild, of Oberlin College, forms _Tract\r\nNo. 87_ in Vol. IV. of the publications of the Western Reserve\r\nHistorical Society. The best account of the Glover rescue case will\r\nbe found in a pamphlet by Mr. Vroman Mason on the _Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw in Wisconsin, with Reference to Nullification Sentiment_, issued\r\nin 1895 by the State Historical Society of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. RECORDS OF TRIALS\r\n\r\nThe reader who acquaints himself even superficially with John Codman\r\nHurd's two volumes, entitled the _Law of Freedom and Bondage in\r\nthe United States_, can not fail to be impressed with the value of\r\nlegal reports for the study of the great contention over slavery.\r\nHurd's pages are full of descriptions and discussions of cases in\r\ntheir judicial bearing, and his foot-notes are largely made up of\r\nreferences to the published reports of trials.\r\n\r\nIn the series of these records of trials, one may trace the history\r\nof legal opposition to the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave laws,\r\nnote the decision in the Prigg case, by which the efficiency of the\r\nlaw of 1793 was destroyed, and the Southern demand for a new law\r\nmade imperative, mark the clash of state and federal jurisdictions,\r\nand see the growth of the spirit of nullification in the North.\r\nFor these purposes, one should consult not only the records of\r\nthe Supreme Court and the lower courts, such as _Federal Cases_,\r\nHoward's _Reports_, McLean's _Reports_, _Ohio State Reports_,\r\n_Wisconsin Reports_, etc., but also the various law periodicals, for\r\nexample, the _American Law Register_, the _Legal Intelligencer_, and\r\nthe _Western Law Journal_. Some important cases have been published\r\nin pamphlet form, while two at least are more minutely set forth in\r\nbooks; a volume is devoted to the Oberlin-Wellington rescue case,\r\nand several relate to the trial of Anthony Burns.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast with the legal reports and law periodicals,\r\nlittle can be gleaned from the popular magazines of fugitive slave\r\ndays. The ethics of resistance to the laws for the recovery of\r\nrunaways is discussed in the _North American Review_ for July,\r\n1850, and in the _Democratic Review_, Vol. V, 1851, and incidents\r\ntypical of the experience of the underground operator and his\r\nconfederates are recited in _Once a Week_ for June, 1862. Careful\r\nand extended search has revealed nothing in the better known\r\nperiodicals published during the War and the two decades following.\r\nRecently, however, abolitionists have become retrospective and\r\nreminiscent, and the tales of their midnight adventures in\r\ncontravention of those laws of their country which they deemed\r\nsubversive of the \"higher law\" begin to appear in periodicals and\r\nnewspapers. For example, the first of a series of stories, which\r\nare founded upon facts, was printed in the _Lake Shore and Home\r\nMagazine_ for July, 1887, an article on the Underground Railroad\r\nappeared in the _Magazine of Western History_ for March, 1887, and\r\na \"symposium\" of reminiscences was published in the _Firelands\r\nPioneer_ for July, 1888. Articles of a miscellaneous nature, in\r\nwhich points of interest are brought out, have been appearing\r\nin some of the monthly magazines within more recent years, for\r\ninstance, in the _Atlantic Monthly_, the _Century Magazine_, and the\r\n_New England Magazine_.\r\n\r\nOnly vague and rare references to the Underground Railroad and its\r\nworkings are made in the newspapers of ante-bellum days, and these\r\nare of little value. The _Liberator_ was fierce in its opposition\r\nto the Fugitive Slave Laws, and contains many stories of fugitives,\r\nbut in this, as in less radical newspapers, the editor observed a\r\ndiscreet silence concerning the secret efforts of his colaborers in\r\nemancipating the bondman. It is necessary, therefore, to rely upon\r\nthe long delayed accounts contributed by operators now advanced in\r\nyears to the columns of the press. In 1885, interesting articles\r\nwere printed in the _Western Star_, of Indiana, and the _New\r\nLexington_ (Ohio) _Tribune_, and since then, especially since 1890,\r\nmany others have been published. These have been patiently gathered,\r\nand form a part of the author's collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. HISTORIES OF RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES\r\n\r\nMaterials relative to the attitude of various religious\r\ndenominations towards slavery are to be found in the histories of\r\nthe different church organizations, such as William Hodgson's _The\r\nSociety of Friends in the Nineteenth Century_, Dr. H. N. McTyeire's\r\n_History of Methodism_, and Dr. R. E. Thompson's _History of the\r\nPresbyterian Churches in the United States_.\r\n\r\nOther works, for example A. C. Applegarth's _Quakers in\r\nPennsylvania_ and S. B. Weeks' _Southern Quakers and Slavery_,\r\nwhich, while dealing with a single denomination, are not to be\r\nregarded as denominational histories in any strict sense, contain\r\npoints of interest and value.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. MATERIALS BEARING ON LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nThe study of our colonial legislation supplies ample proof that the\r\nharboring of the hunted slave early became a source of annoyance\r\nto slave-owners. Laws against this misdemeanor, with curious\r\npenalties attached, are included in the collections of statutes\r\nof various colonies, for example, in the _Laws and Ordinances of\r\nNew Netherlands_, the _Maryland Archives_ (Assembly Proceedings),\r\nthe _Acts of the Province of New York_, the _Province Laws of\r\nPennsylvania_, the _Laws of Virginia_, etc. These statutes have been\r\nmade accessible through their publication in series of volumes,\r\na good collection of which may be found in the State Library in\r\nBoston. Among the most important editions are Leaming and Spicer's\r\ncollection for New Jersey, Hening's series of Virginia Statutes at\r\nLarge, Bacon's collection for Maryland, and Iredell's edition of\r\nSouth Carolina Statutes.\r\n\r\nThe history of our national legislation respecting fugitive slaves\r\nmay be traced in outline in the _Journals of the Senate and House_.\r\nFor the voicing of the need of this legislation, which one would\r\nnaturally expect to find in the speeches of members from the\r\nSouthern states, one must turn to the _Annals of Congress_, covering\r\nthe period from 1789 to 1824, the _Congressional Debates_, for the\r\nperiod from 1824 to 1837, and the _Congressional Globe_ from 1833\r\nto 1864. The provisions of the Fugitive Slave laws one may find,\r\nof course, in the _Statutes at Large_, and some of the effects of\r\nthe law of 1850 may be studied in a pamphlet entitled _The Fugitive\r\nSlave Law and Its Victims_, compiled by Samuel May, Jr., and first\r\npublished in 1856. An enlarged edition of this pamphlet was issued\r\nin 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. CONTEMPORANEOUS AND MODERN BOOKS ON SLAVERY\r\n\r\nUnder this heading are brought for convenience several different\r\nclasses of books on slavery. The first of these classes comprises\r\nthe three small volumes, published during the interval from 1816\r\nto 1826, in which immediate emancipation was advocated by the Rev.\r\nGeorge Bourne, the Rev. James Duncan, and the Rev. John Rankin. Our\r\ninterest here in the teaching of these men arises primarily from the\r\ncircumstance that two of them, at least, are known to have done what\r\nthey could to advance the work of the Underground Railroad, while\r\nall of them lived, at the time of the appearance of their books, on\r\nor near the border line over which came the trembling fugitive in\r\nsearch of freedom.\r\n\r\nAnother class is made up of volumes descriptive of slavery. Such\r\nare Mrs. Frances A. Kemble's _Journal of a Residence on a Georgian\r\nPlantation in 1836-1839_, Frederick Law Olmsted's _Cotton Kingdom_,\r\nG. M. Weston's _Progress of Slavery in the United States_, and\r\na book that has but recently come from the press, Edward Ingle's\r\n_Southern Sidelights_.\r\n\r\nIn a third class must be grouped such recent monographs as Mrs.\r\nMarion G. McDougall's _Fugitive Slaves_, and Miss Mary Tremaine's\r\n_Slavery in the District of Columbia_. The former has been found to\r\nbe especially serviceable, not only because of its subject matter,\r\nbut also because of its numerous and accurate references and its\r\nlong list of notable fugitive slave cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. SECONDARY WORKS\r\n\r\nOne will seek in vain in the secondary works for an adequate account\r\nof the Underground Railroad, or a proper estimate of its importance,\r\nwhether one looks in the general histories of the United States,\r\nsuch as the works of Von Holst, Schouler, and Rhodes, the more\r\ncondensed books of which we have an example in Prof. J. W. Burgess's\r\n_The Middle Period_, or the histories of slavery, like Wilson's\r\n_Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America_, Greeley's _American\r\nConflict_, Williams' _History of the Negro Race_, and Willey's\r\n_History of the Anti-Slavery Cause in State and Nation_. These works\r\nare important for their discussions from different points of view of\r\nthe political forces and constitutional questions involved in the\r\nstruggle for emancipation, and in general they present descriptions\r\nof the famous contested fugitive slave cases and cases of rescue,\r\nbut they have failed, on account of the small amount of evidence\r\nhitherto available, to arrive at a proper view of the political\r\nsignificance of the underground system.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. LIBRARIES\r\n\r\nWhile the great mass of evidence that has made this volume possible\r\nwas collected by field work, the author did not neglect to search\r\nlibraries, both public and private, in the prosecution of his\r\nundertaking. He was able to make use of the public libraries of\r\nCincinnati, besides the private library of Major E. C. Dawes of that\r\ncity, the state library, and the library of Ohio State University at\r\nColumbus, the library of C. M. Burton, Esq., of Detroit, Michigan,\r\nand during two years' residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he was\r\nable to avail himself of the splendid collections of anti-slavery\r\nbooks and pamphlets to be found in the Boston Public Library and\r\nthe library of Harvard University. The materials for the chapter\r\non \"Prosecutions of Underground Railroad Men\" were gathered in the\r\nHarvard Law Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED COLLECTIONS OF UNDERGROUND RAILROAD INCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLEVI COFFIN.
